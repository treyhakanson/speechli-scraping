Bong-g-g! Bong-g-g!--_\"\n\nWith a hollow booming sound reminiscent of old eighteenth-and\nnineteenth-century clock towers, the electronic time tone rang out from\nthe Tower of Galileo, chiming the hour of nine. As the notes\nreverberated over the vast expanse of Space Academy, U.S.A., the lights\nin the windows of the cadet dormitories began to wink out and the\nslidewalks that crisscrossed the campus, connecting the various\nbuildings, rumbled to a halt. When the last mournful note had rolled\naway to die in the distant hills, the school was dark and still. The\nonly movement to be seen was the slow pacing of the cadet watch\nofficers, patrolling their beats; the only sound, the measured clicking\nof their boots on the metal strips of the slidewalks.\n\nOn the north side of the quadrangle near the Tower, a young watch\nofficer paused in front of one of the dormitories and scanned the\ndarkened windows of the durasteel and crystal building. Satisfied that\nall was in order, he continued on his lonely way. A moment later a\nshadowy figure rose out of the bushes opposite the dormitory entrance\nand stepped forward quickly and cautiously. Pausing on the slidewalk to\nstare after the disappearing watch officer, the figure was illuminated\nby the dim light from the entrance hall. He was a young man wearing the\nroyal-blue uniform of a Space Cadet. Tall and wiry, with square features\ntopped by a shock of close-cropped blond hair, he stood poised on the\nballs of his feet, ready to move quickly should another watch officer\nappear.\n\nAfter a quick glance at his wrist chronometer, the young cadet darted\nacross the slidewalk toward the transparent crystal portal of the\ndormitory. Hesitating only long enough to make certain that the inner\nhallway was clear, he slid the portal open, ducked inside, and sprinted\ndown the hall toward a large black panel on the wall near the foot of\nthe slidestairs. On the panel, in five long columns, were the name\nplates of every cadet quartered in the dormitory and beside each plate\nwere two words, IN and OUT, with a small tab that fitted over one of the\nwords.\n\nOut of the one hundred and fifty cadets in the dormitory, one hundred\nand forty-nine were marked IN. The slender, blond-haired cadet quickly\nmade it unanimous, reaching up to the tab next to the name of Roger\nManning and sliding it over to cover the word OUT. With a last final\nlook around, he raced up the slidestairs, smiling in secret triumph.\n\nIn Room 512 on the fifth floor of the dormitory, Tom Corbett and Astro,\nthe two other cadets who, with Roger Manning, made up the famed\n_Polaris_ unit of the Space Cadet Corps, were deep in their studies.\nThough the lights-out order had been given over the dormitory\nloud-speaker system, the desk lamp burned brightly and there was a\nblanket thrown over the window. The boys of the _Polaris_ unit weren't\nalone in their disobedience. All over the dormitory, lights were on and\ncadets were studying secretly. But they all felt fairly safe, for the\ncadet watch officers on each floor were anxious to study themselves and\nturned a blind eye. Even the Solar Guard officer of the day, in charge\nof the entire dormitory, was sympathetic to their efforts and made a\ngreat deal of unnecessary noise while on his evening rounds.\n\nHis brown curly hair falling over his forehead, Tom Corbett frowned in\nconcentration as he kept the earphones of his study machine clamped\ntightly to his ears and listened to a recorded lecture on astrophysics\nas it unreeled from the spinning study spool. As command cadet of the\n_Polaris_ unit, Tom was required to know more than merely his particular\nduty as pilot of a rocket ship. He had to be familiar with every phase\nof space travel, with a working knowledge of the duties of all his unit\nmates.\n\nAstro, the power-deck officer of the unit, paced back and forth between\nthe bunks like a huge, hulking bear, muttering to himself as he tried to\nmemorize the table of reaction times for rocket motors. Though the huge\nVenusian cadet was a genius at all mechanical tasks, and able to work\nwith tools the way a surgeon worked with instruments, he had great\ndifficulty in learning the theories and scientific reasons for all the\nthings he did instinctively. Suddenly Astro stopped, looked at his\nchronometer, then turned to Tom.\n\n\"Hey, Tom!\" he called. \"Where's that jerk, Manning?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" replied Tom, lifting one of the earphones from his ears. \"What\ndid you say, Astro?\"\n\n\"Where's Manning?\" reiterated Astro. \"It's ten minutes after lights\nout.\"\n\n\"He was going to get those study spools for us, wasn't he?\" mused Tom.\n\n\"He should've been back by now,\" grunted the Venusian. \"The library\nclosed an hour ago. Besides, he couldn't have gotten those spools. Every\nother cadet in the Academy is after them.\"\n\n\"Well, he's a pretty resourceful joker,\" sighed Tom, turning back to the\nstudy machine. \"When he goes after something, he gets it by hook or\ncrook.\"\n\n\"It's the crook part that bothers me,\" grumbled Astro. \"Besides, if the\nO.D. catches him out of quarters, he'll be doing his studying while he's\npolishing up the mess hall.\"\n\nSuddenly the door to the room burst open and slammed closed. Tom and\nAstro whirled to see their missing unit mate lounging against the\ndoorframe, grinning broadly.\n\n\"Roger!\"\n\n\"Where've you been, blast you?\"\n\nTom and Astro both jumped forward and spoke at the same time. The\nblond-haired cadet merely looked at them lazily and then sauntered\nforward, pulling six small study spools from his pockets.\n\n\"You wanted these study spools, didn't you?\" he drawled, giving his unit\nmates three apiece. \"Be my guest and study like mad.\"\n\nTom and Astro quickly read the titles of the spools and then looked at\nRoger in amazement. They were the ones the unit needed for their\nend-term exams, the ones all the cadets needed.\n\n\"Roger,\" Tom demanded, \"how did you get these spools? The library was\nout of them this afternoon. Did you take them from another unit's\nquarters?\"\n\n\"I did not!\" said Roger stoutly. \"And I don't like your insinuations\nthat I would.\" He grinned. \"Relax! We have them and we can breeze\nthrough them in the morning and have them back where they belong by noon\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Where they belong!\" Tom exclaimed. \"Then you have no right to them.\"\n\n\"Listen, hot-shot!\" growled Astro. \"I want to know where you got these\nspools and how.\"\n\n\"Well, if that isn't gratitude for you!\" muttered Roger. \"I go out and\nrisk my neck for my dear beloved unit mates and they stand around\narguing instead of buckling down to study.\"\n\n\"This is no joke, Roger,\" said Tom seriously. \"Now for the last time,\nwill you tell us how you got them?\"\n\nRoger thought a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"All right,\" he\nsaid finally. \"When I went down to the library to see if it was our turn\nfor them yet, I found that we were still twenty-seventh in line.\"\n\n\"Twenty-seventh?\" gasped Astro.\n\n\"That's right, spaceboy!\" snorted Roger. \"So I tried to con that little\nspace doll of a librarian into moving our names up on the list, but just\nthen an Earthworm cadet came in with an order from Tony Richards of the\n_Capella_ unit, an order for the very spools we needed.\"\n\n\"You mean, you took them from an Earthworm?\" queried Tom.\n\n\"Well, I didn't take them exactly,\" replied Roger. \"I waited for him out\non the quadrangle and I told him he was wanted in the cadet dispatcher's\noffice right away and that I would take the spools on up to Tony.\"\n\n\"And you brought them here!\" howled Astro.\n\n\"Yup.\" Roger grinned. \"Do you think that squirt will know who I am? Not\nin a million years. And by the time Tony and the others do find out who\nhas them, we'll be finished. Get it?\"\n\n\"I get it, all right, you crummy little chiseler,\" growled Astro. \"Tom,\nwe gotta give these back to Tony.\"\n\nTom nodded. \"You're right,\" he said.\n\n\"Now wait a minute!\" said Roger angrily. \"I went to a lot of trouble to\nget these things for you--\"\n\n\"Look, Roger,\" Tom interrupted, \"I would rather have one night with\nthose spools than a two-week leave in Atom City right now. But the\n_Capella_ unit is having a tough time making the Spring passing lists.\nThey need those spools more than we do.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Astro. \"We could probably take the tests now and pass, but\nthey really have to study. I'm for getting them back to the _Capella_\nunit right now. How about you, Tom?\"\n\nThe young cadet nodded and turned to Roger who stood there, frowning.\n\"Roger,\" said Tom, \"both Astro and I really appreciate it. But you\nwouldn't want the _Capella_ unit to flunk out of the Academy, would\nyou?\"\n\nRoger gnawed at his thumbnail and then looked at his two unit mates\nsheepishly. \"You're right, fellas,\" he said. \"It was kind of a dirty\ntrick. Give me the spools. I'll take them back to Tony right now.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" exclaimed Astro. \"It's after hours. We're not supposed\nto be out of the dorm.\"\n\nFor a second the three boys looked at each other hesitantly. Then, as\nthough they had telepathically conveyed their individual decisions to\neach other, they turned toward the door. Tom opened it and stepped out\ninto the hall cautiously, then turned back and nodded. Roger and Astro\nfollowed him quickly.\n\nAs Roger closed the door behind him, he murmured, \"There's no reason for\nall of us to go. I was the one who took the spools, so I should bring\nthem back. Why should you two guys risk getting caught?\"\n\nAstro punched him in the shoulder fondly. \"We always work together,\ndon't we?\" he declared. \"If one's gonna get into trouble, we all\nshould.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" urged Tom in a sharp whisper, and they all raced silently\ntoward the slidestairs.\n\nSeconds later, the three cadets of the _Polaris_ unit were down in the\nmain hallway of the dormitory building, tiptoeing toward the front\nportal. Pausing only to look into the O.D.'s office to make sure the\nofficer wouldn't spot them, they reached the portal and ducked out.\nPausing again to scan the immediate area for any watch officers, they\ndarted across the slidewalk and into the shadows of the shrubbery.\n\nQuickly and soundlessly, they raced across the green lawn of the\nquadrangle toward the dormitory where the _Capella_ unit was quartered.\nOnce they sprawled headlong on the turf and lay still as a watch officer\nsuddenly appeared out of the darkness at the base of the Tower of\nGalileo. But he walked past without seeing them and they continued on\nacross the quadrangle.\n\nReaching another clump of shrubbery right opposite the _Capella_ unit's\ndormitory, the boys stopped and discussed their final move.\n\n\"This is getting ridiculous,\" whispered Roger. \"I shouldn't have let you\ntwo come with me. But I'm going the rest of the way myself.\"\n\n\"We came this far, Roger,\" asserted Tom. \"We'll go the rest of the way\nand help you explain.\"\n\n\"And you've got a space-blasting lot to explain.\"\n\nThe three cadets whirled as a familiar voice snarled out of the darkness\nbehind them. They saw three figures, all in cadet uniforms, wearing the\ninsigne of the _Capella_ unit. In the forefront was Tony Richards\nscowling angrily.\n\n\"Tony!\" gasped Tom. \"What are you doing out here?\"\n\n\"We were on our way over to your dorm, Corbett,\" growled Tony Richards.\n\"We saw you three sneaking across the quadrangle.\"\n\n\"Coming to pay us a visit, fellas?\" asked Roger blandly.\n\n\"You know blasted well why we were coming,\" snapped McAvoy, the second\nmember of the _Capella_ crew.\n\nDavison, the third member of the unit, stepped forward. \"Give us back\nour study spools,\" he demanded.\n\n\"Take it easy,\" said Tom in a calm voice. \"We were bringing them back to\nyou.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" snapped McAvoy.\n\n\"Relax,\" growled Astro. \"Tom said we were returning them. We admit it\nwas a dirty trick, but you haven't lost much time. Half an hour maybe.\"\n\n\"Don't try to cover for Manning, Astro,\" said Tony heatedly. \"It's a\nshame you two guys are stuck with a bad rocket like Manning in your\nunit.\"\n\n\"Bad rocket!\" exclaimed Roger.\n\n\"Now, wait a minute, Tony,\" Tom said, advancing toward the\nbroad-shouldered cadet. \"We are returning the spools, and we apologize\nfor yanking them from the Earthworm. But that doesn't mean we'll listen\nto that kind of talk about Roger.\"\n\n\"He stole them, didn't he?\" retorted Davison.\n\nRoger stepped forward. \"Davy, my boy,\" he said in a low controlled tone,\n\"I don't like that remark. I've got a notion to make you eat that word.\"\n\n\"I don't think you can, Manning,\" replied the angry cadet.\n\nTom stepped between them quickly. \"Listen, fellows, we don't want any\ntrouble. Here are the spools.\" He held them out.\n\n\"That's what I mean, Corbett,\" said McAvoy sarcastically. \"Manning gets\nyou in trouble and then you and the big boy have to bail him out.\"\n\n\"We've apologized,\" retorted Astro angrily. \"You're getting the spools\nback. So no more cracks about Roger.\"\n\n\"I can take care of myself, Astro,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Here, take the spools and get back to your dorm,\" growled Tom. He\nhanded the pile of spools over, but as Tony extended his hands, one of\nthe spools dropped to the grass. No one made a move to pick it up.\n\n\"There are the spools,\" said Tom icily. \"Now beat it.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Davison, leaning over to pick up the spool. \"The air is\nbeginning to stink around here.\"\n\nRed-faced, Roger stepped forward and put his foot on the spool just as\nDavison reached for it. \"That's enough, Davison,\" he snarled.\n\n\"Why, you dirty space crawler--\" Davison straightened up and swung\nwildly. Roger ducked the blow easily, then spun the heavy-set cadet\naround and pushed him back into the bushes.\n\nTony Richards stepped forward and Astro turned to him threateningly, but\nTom quickly shoved them aside and faced Richards.\n\n\"Listen, Tony,\" he said. \"We're all out after hours, and if a watch\nofficer spots us, we've had it. We don't want any trouble.\" He glanced\nat Davison, who was being restrained by McAvoy. \"We apologize. Now get\nout of here before we're all logged.\"\n\nRichards nodded and started to turn to his unit mates when suddenly\nDavison jerked free and lunged at Roger. The blond-haired cadet was not\ncaught unawares. He stepped aside and threw a quick jolting right\nstraight to the _Capella_ cadet's jaw. Davison staggered back and fell\nto the ground. He shook his head, jumped to his feet again, and charged\nback with a roar.\n\nBoth Tom and Astro and Tony Richards and McAvoy grabbed at their\nrespective unit mates and tried to restrain them. In the struggle to\nkeep Roger and Davison apart, Astro accidentally pushed Richards to one\nside.\n\n\"What in blazes--!\" yelled Richards. He suddenly released Davison and\ngave Astro a shove that sent the big cadet sprawling. And then, without\nwarning, McAvoy swung at Tom. The curly-haired cadet saw the blow coming\na fraction of a second too late and caught it on the side of his head.\nHe fell back into the bushes.\n\nRoger yelled in anger at the sudden attack, and grabbing Davison by the\nfront of his tunic, slammed a hard right into the cadet's stomach.\nRichards grabbed Roger, holding him around the head and neck, as McAvoy\nswung at him viciously. Seeing their unit mate pommeled, Tom and Astro\ncharged back and the battle was on. The two units forgot about the watch\nofficers and the strong possibility of being caught and slugged it out\nin the darkness of the quadrangle. The fight seemed to be the climax of\na long-standing feud. The _Polaris_ crew had first come to grips with\nRichards and his unit mates when they were assigned to the old rocket\ncruiser _Arcturus_. When the ship was scrapped, the cadets were\ntransferred to the _Capella_, but the rivalry continued stronger than\nbefore. Time and time again, the two crack units had competed for hours\non the athletic fields, in space flight tests, and in the classroom. The\n_Polaris_ unit had constantly come out ahead, often by no more than a\nfraction of points, but their superiority was clear, and the _Capella_\nunit could not repress its resentment and jealousy.\n\nTony Richards and Tom had squared off and were boxing with lightninglike\nthrusts of their fists, each waiting for an opening. In back of them,\nRoger and Davison were simply hammering away at each other's\nmid-sections, and Astro and McAvoy were rolling around on the ground\nlike bears, growling and tugging. It was brute strength against brute\nstrength.\n\nTom danced away from Richards' rapierlike left, weaved low, and shot a\nhard right to his opponent's stomach that left him gasping. Richards\ndoubled over and stepped in to bring up a solid right, then hesitated.\nRichards was through. The blow to the mid-section had taken all the\nfight out of him. Tom refused to pursue his advantage while the other\ncould not fight back. His anger cooling rapidly, Tom realized that the\nwhole fight was nothing more than a misunderstanding. As Richards sank\nto the grass helpless and gasping for breath, Tom turned to break up the\nother two fights. But Roger was just finishing his battle with Davison.\nFeinting to the mid-section and pulling Davison's guard down, Roger\nhooked his left cleanly to the jaw, following immediately with a\nhaymaker right. Davison dropped to the turf, out cold.\n\nMeanwhile, Astro had rolled on top of the last cadet of the _Capella_\nunit, and with his great strength, clamped McAvoy's arms to his side.\nFace to face, the two cadets glared at each other. The muscles tightened\nin Astro's arms, and beads of sweat popped out on his face.\n\n\"Give up!\" demanded the Venusian, tightening his grip.\n\n[Illustration: _Tom shot a hard right to his opponent's stomach_]\n\nSlowly McAvoy sagged under the pressure Astro was applying and his face\nbegan to redden.\n\n\"He'll break his back,\" whispered Roger to Tom.\n\nTom nodded and stepped forward. \"Let him go, Astro. He's finished.\"\n\nAstro did not let go. His face was white with anger. McAvoy bent further\nback. \"Give up,\" demanded Astro.\n\n\"Grab him,\" said Tom to Roger. \"Get him off Mac before he breaks his\nback.\"\n\nTom and Roger jumped to Astro's side and each grabbed one of the\npowerful arms encircling McAvoy. It took all their strength to break the\nviselike hold the giant Venusian had on the other cadet, but slowly they\npulled the muscular arms back and McAvoy slumped to the grass.\n\nThe three victorious cadets paused and looked down at the beaten\n_Capella_ crew, then looked at each other.\n\n\"Well,\" sighed Roger, \"I suppose that the least we can do now is get\nthem back to their dorm.\"\n\nTom and Astro nodded. As the three boys started forward they were\nstopped by a voice behind them--a voice that roared like an atomic\nblast.\n\n\"_Stand to!_\"\n\nWhirling around in surprise for the second time within a space of ten\nminutes, Tom, Astro, and Roger saw a menacing sight standing behind\nthem, his balled fists jammed on his hips, his booted legs widespread,\nand his massive head thrust forward. It was Major Lou Connel, more\nfamiliarly known as \"Blast-off\" Connel, a Senior Line Officer of the\nSolar Guard and the sternest disciplinarian in the whole Academy. Behind\nhim stood a short, thin man, whom none of the boys recognized.\n\nConnel stepped forward slowly and menacingly, glaring at the three boys.\n\n\"Out a little late, aren't you, boys?\" he asked with a mildness that\nsent a chill down their spines.\n\n\"Y-yes sir,\" replied Tom, a slight tremor in his voice.\n\n\"On official business, I presume?\" The major's voice was still as smooth\nas silk.\n\nTom gulped and then shook his head. \"N-no, sir,\" he quavered.\n\nConnel's eyes widened in mock horror. \"Why, Corbett,\" he exclaimed,\n\"didn't anyone ever tell you the rules of Space Academy? Or perhaps you\ndidn't know what time it was?\"\n\nTom bit his lip. He knew that he and his unit mates were caught in a\nhopeless trap and that Connel was simply baiting them. \"I knew what time\nit was, sir,\" he said. \"We're out after hours.\"\n\nSuddenly there was a movement in the brush behind Tom as McAvoy stumbled\nto his feet. Richards also sat up groggily.\n\n\"Major!\" It was the man behind Connel who spoke. \"Who are they?\"\n\nAs though in answer, Davison stood up too and the three members of the\n_Capella_ unit were suddenly and horribly aware of the presence of\nConnel. They immediately braced themselves, their faces white with\nsudden fear.\n\n\"So!\" Now the major's voice began to roar again. \"Fighting, eh? Well,\nnow we really have something here.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" began Richards tremulously, \"if you'll let us explain--\"\n\n\"I'll let you explain all right,\" thundered Connel. \"Out after hours,\nfighting, you'll have a great time explaining to an inquiry.\"\n\n\"An inquiry!\" Tom exclaimed involuntarily.\n\n\"Did you expect anything less?\" roared Connel. \"You are all under arrest\nand confined to quarters.\"\n\nThe six cadets all trembled but said nothing, standing at rigid\nattention, eyes straight ahead.\n\n\"Return to your quarters immediately.\"\n\nAs one, the cadets wheeled and marched off. Tom, Astro, and Roger walked\nacross the quadrangle back to their dorm, and the _Capella_ unit took\nthe slidewalk that led to their quarters. Connel watched them go, a\nferocious scowl on his craggy features.\n\n\"Little rough on them, weren't you, Major?\" asked the man who stood\nbeside the Solar Guard officer.\n\n\"Rules are meant to be obeyed, Professor Hemmingwell,\" retorted Connel\nstiffly.\n\n\"Perhaps you're right,\" mused the stranger. \"But what's this about an\ninquiry?\"\n\n\"A trial, Professor. A trial conducted by the cadets themselves to see\nwhether or not the accused should be kicked out of the Academy.\"\n\n\"Kicked out?\" exclaimed the professor. \"You certainly do believe in\ndiscipline.\"\n\n\"These boys are to be Solar Guardsmen,\" replied Connel shortly. \"If they\ncan't obey orders now, they never will.\"\n\n\"Well, it's all very unimportant really, Major,\" Hemmingwell said with\na shrug. \"We have many more vital things to think about now than mere\ncadets. Shall we go? Commander Walters is waiting for us.\"\n\nAs the little man in civilian clothes walked away, Connel stifled a\nblistering retort. True, his mission here at the Academy was of great\nimportance. But cadets were important too. And he was afraid. The\n_Polaris_ unit was in grave trouble, grave enough to cause expulsion\nfrom the Academy.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nSpace Academy, U.S.A.!\n\nThis was the dream and goal of every boy in the thrilling year 2354,\nwhen mankind had reached out beyond the bounds of Earth and had\nconquered space, colonizing planets and blazing trails to distant worlds\ndeep in the black void of the outer universe. To support the\never-growing need for trained spacemen to man the rocket ships that\nlinked the planets and distant satellite outposts, the Solar Alliance,\nthe government of the solar system, had erected Space Academy. It was\nthere that the most promising boys were trained to become members of the\nSolar Guard to patrol the space lanes and keep peace in the universe.\n\nOrganized into tight, hard-hitting units of three, the Academy cadets\nwere trained to work together under the most severe conditions. Their\nwaking hours were spent in one of two places; in powerful rocket\ncruisers, blasting through space on endless training missions, or at the\nAcademy in classrooms and lecture halls, where they studied everything\nfrom the theory of space flight to the application of space laws. A very\nimportant course of study was the theory of government. For, above all\nelse, the Solar Alliance was a government of the people. And to assure\nthe survival and continuance of that democratic system, the officers of\nthe Solar Guard functioned as the watchdogs of the space democracy,\nentrusted with the vital mission of making sure the government reflected\nthe will of the people.\n\nAs a practical approach to this course, the Academy officials had\nestablished a Cadet Council for the settlement of disputes and\ninfractions of rules by the cadets. It was to this cadet governing body\nthat the fight between the _Polaris_ and the _Capella_ units was\nreferred by Major Connel.\n\nThe Academy had buzzed with talk since the fight, and sides were drawn\nhard and fast. Both units were extremely popular and the arguments raged\nthrough the dormitories as to which unit was at fault.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cadet Council decided to have a full trial to give each\nunit a fair chance to defend itself against the charges. A judge and\njury were selected and lawyers appointed for each side. Finally a date\nwas set for the trial.\n\nDuring this time, Tom, Roger, and Astro were confined to their quarters.\nThey did not talk much, each conscious of the fact that should the Cadet\nCouncil decide against them, they might be expelled from the Academy.\nThe same was true about the _Capella_ unit, of course, but the Council\nmight decide the _Polaris_ had instigated the whole affair. Roger was\nparticularly silent, since his actions in obtaining the study spools\nhad started the whole chain of disastrous events.\n\nThe boys did not know which cadet would be appointed to defend them\nuntil late the following afternoon when there was a knock on the door,\nand a small, thin cadet, wearing a thick pair of eyeglasses that gave\nhim a decided owllike look, entered the room.\n\n\"Alfie Higgins!\" cried Tom.\n\n\"The Brain!\" yelled Astro.\n\n\"Glad to see you, pal!\" shouted Roger.\n\nThe three cadets surrounded little Alfie and pommeled him playfully in\ntheir joy at seeing another cadet. Alfie merely looked at them gravely.\n\n\"Hello, Tom, Roger, Astro,\" he said somberly.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Tom. \"We're not allowed visitors.\"\n\n\"I'm not a visitor, Tom,\" replied the little cadet. \"I'm your defense\nlawyer.\" He glanced at Roger and Astro. \"I hope that will be\nsatisfactory to you.\"\n\n\"Satisfactory!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Alfie, we couldn't ask for anyone\nbetter.\"\n\n\"That's right, Brain,\" said Roger. \"You're the boy for us.\"\n\nAstro grunted his approval. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Well, in that case,\" said Alfie, opening his brief case, \"I would\nsuggest that we get right down to the facts. The trial is tomorrow.\"\n\n\"All right, Alfie, we're ready,\" said Tom. \"I suppose you want to hear\nthe whole thing.\"\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" said Alfie, adjusting his eyeglasses. \"You start,\nRoger.\"\n\nSitting around the room, relaxed, yet concerned, the four cadets\ndiscussed the details of the case. Alfie took copious notes,\noccasionally interrupting Tom or Roger or Astro to ask a pointed\nquestion.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey talked for nearly four hours before Alfie was finally satisfied\nthat he knew all the facts. He left them with the same somber attitude\nhe had when he first arrived, and when the boys were alone, they each\nfelt a chill of fear. The full meaning of a defense lawyer hit them.\nThey were in serious trouble. After a few moments of silence, Tom rose\nand went into the bathroom to take a shower. Astro flopped on his back\nin his bunk and went to sleep. Roger began throwing darts idly at his\n\"solar system\" over his bunk. It was a map of his own design depicting\nthe planets revolving around the sun, only each planet was represented\nby a picture of a girl, and his own grinning countenance was the sun. He\nwas known to have made dates by throwing a dart at the map blindly and\ntaking out the girl whose picture he had hit.\n\nWhen Tom returned a few minutes later, he looked at his unit mates and\nshook his head. Never, in all the adventures they had shared or all the\ntough situations they had been in, had either Roger or Astro given up as\nthey seemed to be doing now.\n\n\"And,\" thought Tom miserably, \"with good reason too! I feel like tossing\nin the sponge myself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe huge Space Academy gymnasium had been converted into a temporary\ncourtroom, and at ten A.M. the following day the cavernous chamber was\npacked with all the cadets who could get off duty, in addition to a\nliberal sprinkling of Solar Guard officers and instructors who were\nkeenly interested in their pupils' handling of orderly democratic\nprocedure.\n\nAs the cadet judge opened the proceedings, Commander Walters, Major\nConnel, Captain Strong, and Lieutenant Wolchek, unit commander of the\n_Capella_ crew, watched intently from their seats in the back of the\ngym. Up forward, at two small tables immediately in front of the\nCouncil's platform, the _Polaris_ and _Capella_ units sat rigidly, while\ntheir defense lawyers arranged papers and data on the table for quick\nreference. Little Alfie Higgins didn't say a word to Tom, Roger, or\nAstro, merely studied his opponent, Cadet Benjy Edwards, who was acting\nas attorney for the _Capella_ unit. Edwards, a beefy boy with a florid\nface, looked across the chamber and sneered at Tom. The young cadet\nrepressed a quick shudder of anger. There was bad blood between the two.\nOnce, Tom had found Edwards bullying a helpless group of Earthworm\ncadets, forcing them to march and exercise under a broiling Martian sun\nfor no reason at all, and Tom had put a stop to it. Edwards had taken\nevery opportunity to get back at Tom, and now he had his best chance.\n\nFrom the beginning, the trial was argued bitterly. Though the issues\nwere clear-cut--illegal possession of the study spools, out on the\nquadrangle after hours, and fighting--Edwards tried to accuse the\n_Polaris_ unit of irrelevant infractions. But Alfie Higgins was his\nequal. From the beginning, he admitted that the _Polaris_ unit was\nguilty of the first charge, but made a strong claim that they had more\nthan made up for the infraction by risking censure to return the spools\nto their rightful owners. In addition, he forced Tony Richards to admit\nthat he had accepted Roger's apology. The Council agreed to drop that\ncharge and to hold the second charge in abeyance, since both units\nseemed to have had good reason for being out after hours. Benjy Edwards\nscowled but could find no reason to object to the Council's decision.\nAlfie, on the other hand, broke into a smile for the first time that\nmorning. He turned to the Council and announced that the only point of\nissue was the fight and who struck the first blow.\n\nIn the back of the room, Connel turned to Strong. \"I, personally, am\ngoing to sign the pass for a week's leave for Alfie when this is over,\"\nhe said. \"I never saw such a ding-blasted brain in operation in all my\nlife.\"\n\n\"He really slipped one over on Benjy Edwards all right,\" muttered\nStrong, his voice tinged with pride.\n\nIn front of the Council platform, Alfie turned to the judge.\n\n\"I would like to call to the stand, if the court please,\" he said in a\nclear voice, \"Cadet Tom Corbett.\"\n\nTom walked to the chair, was sworn in, and sat down, facing Alfie.\n\n\"Cadet Corbett,\" Higgins paused, and then asked almost casually, \"did\nyou strike the first blow?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Dismissed,\" said Higgins suddenly. \"Call Roger Manning to the stand,\nplease.\"\n\nRoger rose, and passing Tom on the way back, took his place on the stand\nand repeated the oath.\n\nAlfie looked at Roger calmly and in a clear voice asked, \"Cadet Manning,\ndid you strike the first blow?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Dismissed,\" said Alfie. \"Please call Cadet Astro to the stand.\"\n\nThe cadet audience began to murmur and sit forward tensely.\n\n\"What the devil is he doing?\" growled Connel.\n\nStrong grinned. \"Blast me if I know, Lou,\" he said. \"But wait and see.\nI'll bet you ten credits it's a lulu.\"\n\nAstro was sworn in and Alfie waited for the room to become quiet.\n\n\"Cadet Astro,\" he said finally, \"you have heard the other members of the\n_Polaris_ unit state, under solemn oath, that they did not strike the\nfirst blow. Now, I ask you to consider carefully your answer. Did you,\nCadet Astro\"--Alfie paused dramatically, and nearly shouted the final\npart of the question--\"strike the first blow?\"\n\n\"No!\" bellowed Astro.\n\n\"Dismissed,\" said Alfie quickly, turning to the Council. \"Gentlemen,\" he\nsaid, \"he did not strike the first blow, nor did Cadet Corbett, nor\nCadet Manning. And I will not insist that the three members of the\n_Capella_ unit be asked the same question, since I concede that they are\nthree impeccable gentlemen who could _not_ strike the first blow in a\ncommon fight.\"\n\nAs the audience in the courtroom burst into a roar, Benjy Edwards jumped\nto his feet.\n\n\"Your honor,\" he appealed, \"I insist that the _Capella_ unit be allowed\nto take the stand and deny the charge--\"\n\n\"Your honor,\" interrupted Alfie, \"the _Polaris_ unit makes no charge.\nThey freely admit that the _Capella_ unit could not, I repeat, sir,\ncould not have struck the first blow. And the _Polaris_ unit--\"\n\n\"Your honor--!\" cried Edwards. \"I insist.\"\n\nThe cadet judge rapped his gavel. \"_Polaris_ counsel will speak.\"\n\n\"Thank you, your honor. I just wanted to say that the members of the\n_Polaris_ unit defer to the _Capella_ unit. I submit, your honor, that\nit was nothing more than a misunderstanding and that both sides should\nbe punished or freed.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked the cadet judge.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Alfie.\n\n\"Counsel for the _Capella_ unit may speak now. Do you insist on having\nyour defendants brought to the stand to swear they did not start the\nfight?\"\n\n\"Your honor--\" began Benjy. But Alfie had already planted the seed.\nThere were shouts of \"Give it to both of them\" from the gym.\n\nRed-faced, Edwards held up his hand and appealed for quiet. \"Your\nhonor,\" he began at last, \"after consultation with the members of the\n_Capella_ unit, they have directed me to state that they are willing to\nabide by the suggestion of the _Polaris_ counsel.\"\n\nAs the cadets in the courtroom roared their approval, the cadet judge\nconsulted quickly with the members of the Council. A decision was\nreached quickly. A verdict of conduct unbecoming cadets was brought\nagainst both units, with orders for a strong reprimand to be placed on\ntheir individual official records. In addition, each unit was denied\nleaves and week-end passes from the Academy until the end of the term,\nfour weeks away. All spare time was to be spent on guard duty.\n\n\"You are to report to Chief Warrant Officer Timothy Rush for further\norders on all time not actually accountable for in Academy schedules,\"\nconcluded the cadet judge. \"Dismissed.\"\n\nThe case was closed with a loud roar of approval from the entire cadet\naudience, who had seen justice done and democracy in action. Tom, Astro,\nand Roger looked at each other and smiled. They were still Space\nCadets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"Where is Captain Strong?\"\n\nStartled, Commander Walters glanced up to see Major Connel enter his\noffice, accompanied by Professor Hemmingwell. The thin little man\nscowled with irritation as he walked right up to the commander's desk.\n\n\"I wanted Captain Strong here for this meeting,\" the professor\ncontinued.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Walters. \"Captain Strong _should_ be here.\" He\nturned to Connel. \"Have you seen him, Connel?\"\n\nAs Connel lowered his bulk into a soft chair, he sighed. \"Steve is with\nhis unit, chewing them out over that fight with the _Capella_ unit.\"\n\nWalters grinned. \"You heard about our trial, Professor?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Hemmingwell stiffly. \"Frankly, I cannot see how Captain\nStrong can ignore this meeting to hold hands with those infantile\ncadets.\"\n\nConnel's face turned red and he glanced quickly at Walters, whose face\nwas approaching the same color. Neither expected such a comment from a\nscientist.\n\n\"Professor,\" said Connel heavily, leaning forward in his chair, \"I\nassure you Steve Strong is _not_ holding their hands. In fact, I would\nhate to be in those cadets' shoes right now.\"\n\nHemmingwell grunted and drew back from Connel's burning glare. \"Be that\nas it may,\" he said. \"I cannot see that the staff of this institution\nhas done anything constructive for the last three days. So far as I'm\nconcerned, this childish talk about a common fight has been a complete\nwaste of time.\"\n\n\"Professor Hemmingwell,\" said Commander Walters, rising from his chair,\n\"if there had to be a choice between your project, as valuable as it may\nbe, and the valuable lesson learned today by my cadets, I'll tell you\nright now that the lesson would come first. This was a very important\nissue. The cadets had their real taste of democracy in action today,\ndown on a level where they could understand it. And, I dare say, there\nare quite a few boys who heard that childish talk, as you put it, and\nwill remember it some time in the future when they are called on to act\nas officers of the Solar Alliance.\"\n\nConnel cleared his throat noisily. \"I think we'd better get on with the\nmeeting,\" he said. \"Do you have the plans and specifications,\nHemmingwell?\"\n\nBut the wiry professor refused to be dissuaded. He faced Commander\nWalters and wagged his finger under the spaceman's nose.\n\n\"You have a perfect right to your own ideas concerning the education of\nyour cadets!\" he shouted. \"But I have a right to my ideas regarding my\nspace projectile operations. I've devoted a good part of my life to this\nplan, and I will not allow anything, or anyone, to stand in my way.\"\n\nBefore Walters could reply, Connel jumped up and growled.\n\n\"All right! Now that we've got the speeches out of the way, let's get\ndown to work.\"\n\nWalters and the professor suddenly stopped short and grinned at the\nbrusque line officer, who, for all his bullying tactics, knew how to\ntake the edge off a touchy situation. Walters sat down again and\nHemmingwell spread out several large maps on Walters' desk. He pointed\nto a location on the chart of the area surrounding Space Academy.\n\n\"This is the area here,\" he said, placing his finger on the map. \"I\nthink it is best suited for our purpose. Dave Barret and Carter Devers\nconcur--\"\n\n\"Someone mention my name?\"\n\nThe sliding door to the commander's office opened and a tall,\ndistinguished man with iron-gray hair entered, followed by a handsome,\nyounger man.\n\n\"Devers!\" exclaimed Hemmingwell in obvious delight. \"I didn't expect you\nuntil this evening.\"\n\n\"Got away earlier than I figured,\" replied the elder man, who then\nturned to the two Solar Guard officers. \"Hello, Commander Walters, Major\nConnel. Meet Dave Barret, my assistant.\" He gestured toward the young\nman beside him and they shook hands in turn.\n\n\"Well,\" said Devers, \"have we missed anything?\"\n\n\"Just starting,\" replied Walters.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Devers. \"Oh, by the way, I want it understood, Commander,\nthat while I am lending Dave to you to work on the operation with the\nprofessor, I'm not even going to let you pay him. He remains on my\npayroll, so you can't take him away from me. The Jilolo Spaceways would\nbe lost without him.\"\n\nWalters smiled. \"All right with me,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't care _who_ pays him, as long as he's with me on this,\nCommander,\" said Hemmingwell, wiping his glasses carefully. \"That young\nman has a mind equipped with a built-in calculator.\"\n\nDave Barret grinned in obvious embarrassment. \"If Mr. Devers can devote\nhis time to you for one credit a year as salary, I have no objections to\nworking on this project,\" he said. \"In fact, I told Mr. Devers that if\nhe didn't let me come down here, I'd quit and come, anyway.\"\n\nHemmingwell beamed. \"Well, now, if Captain Strong were only here, we\ncould get along with the business at hand.\"\n\nDevers frowned. \"Why is he so important?\" he asked.\n\n\"Steve has been placed in charge of procurement for the construction of\nthe hangar and getting the spur line in from the monorail station,\"\nreplied Connel. \"And that reminds me, Professor,\" he continued. \"Where\nis your hangar going to be? And where is that spur coming in from? Are\nwe going to have a lot of building to do to get that blasted thing\nsnaked over those hills?\" Connel pointed to the protective ring of high\nrugged peaks that surrounded the Academy.\n\n\"That's why Dave Barret here is so important,\" replied Hemmingwell. \"He\nfigured out a way of tunneling through this section here\"--he pointed to\na particularly rugged section of the hills--\"at half the cost of\nbringing it straight in on that plain there.\"\n\nConnel and Walters studied the map closely. \"Very good,\" said Walters.\n\n\"You think you can do it, Dave?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"I'm sure I can, sir,\" replied the young man.\n\n\"And save time?\" growled Connel.\n\n\"I'll have that line through, and in operation, bringing in the first\nhaul of hangar material in three weeks.\"\n\nImpressed by the young man's confidence, Connel turned to Commander\nWalters and nodded.\n\n\"Well, if you can do that, Barret,\" said Walters, \"Professor Hemmingwell\nwill have to begin his operations now, won't you, Professor?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said the wiry old man. \"Right now, this very minute.\"\n\nDevers suddenly spoke up. \"I would like to have one thing explained,\nCommander, unless, of course, it's a breach of security, but--\" He\nhesitated.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"I've been going along with you for some time now,\" explained Devers.\n\"But I still don't know the exact nature of the projectile you propose\nto build. What's the purpose of it?\"\n\n\"You certainly deserve an answer to that question,\" said Commander\nWalters warmly. \"You've contributed your services to this operation\nabsolutely blindly. Now you should know everything.\" He paused and\nlooked at Hemmingwell and Connel, who nodded in return. \"Carter,\" he\nresumed, \"we are going to create a spaceship that can launch a large\nprojectile filled with cargo and send it to any small area.\"\n\nCarter Devers' face lighted up. \"You mean, you are going to fire\npayloads from space freighters instead of landing with them?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Walters. \"These freighters will deliver mail and\nsupplies to out-of-the-way settlements that do not have a spaceport\nlarge enough to handle the giant freighters and have to depend on\nsurface transport from the larger cities.\"\n\nCarter Devers shook his head slowly. \"This is the most amazing thing\nI've ever heard of in my life.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd be surprised, Carter,\" said Walters, his face glowing\nwith pleasure. \"The big item, of course, is to lick the problem of\nstandardizing the receivers for the projectiles. They must be\nlightweight, easily assembled, and precision made, since it's going to\nhave an electronic gismo inside for the projectile to 'home' on.\"\n\nProfessor Hemmingwell grunted. \"That electronic gismo, as you call it,\nis the real idea behind the whole operation.\"\n\n\"How is that, Professor?\" asked Devers.\n\n\"Well, it works on this principle,\" began Hemmingwell. \"The receiver\nwill send out a distinctive radar beam. In the spaceship, the projectile\ndesignated for that receiver will be tuned in to the frequency of that\nbeam and fired from the ship. A homing device, built into the projectile\nwill take over, guiding it right down the beam to its destination.\"\n\n\"And how does that radar beam work?\" asked Devers.\n\n\"That,\" said Connel stiffly, \"is a military secret.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" nodded Devers, smiling. \"I was just curious.\"\n\n\"Well, now that we're agreed on a site for the operation,\" said\nProfessor Hemmingwell, \"is there anything else you want to discuss,\nCommander?\"\n\n\"Not for the moment, Professor,\" replied the commandant of Space\nAcademy. \"You have any more questions, Major Connel?\"\n\nWhen Connel shook his head, Devers spoke up again.\n\n\"There is something else I would like to know, if it isn't a breach of\nmilitary secrecy,\" he said with a smile at Connel. \"I don't remember\nseeing anything about this project in the bills sent before the Solar\nCouncil. When was it authorized?\"\n\n\"It wasn't,\" snapped Hemmingwell. \"It was blocked before it came to a\nvote. So I ran around the whole Solar Alliance, begging and borrowing\nthe money to finance the project myself.\"\n\n\"And the Solar Guard is just lending technical assistance and\nfacilities,\" supplied Walters. \"Of course, should the project succeed,\nwe will go before the Solar Council with an emergency request to\nincorporate the idea into the defense of all Solar Guard outposts.\"\n\n\"Private capital, eh?\" said Devers, turning to look at the professor\nadmiringly. \"You are a very brave man, Professor Hemmingwell, to risk so\nmuch. And, I might add, you must be an excellent salesman to sell Solar\nAlliance bankers your ideas.\"\n\n\"Common sense,\" snorted the professor. \"Plain horse sense.\"\n\n\"Still,\" insisted Devers, \"most of the bankers with whom I've ever tried\nto talk common sense _were_ horses.\" As everyone laughed, he turned to\nWalters. \"Now, just what do you want me to do, Commander?\"\n\n\"Carter, you've done so much for this project already that I'm going to\ngive you a rest,\" said Walters.\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"From now on,\" Major Connel broke in, \"the project will be in the hands\nof the professor. If he needs anything, he'll tell Steve Strong. If\nStrong can't fulfill the request, he'll pass it on to Commander Walters,\nand if the commander feels it necessary to have your help, he will\ncontact you.\"\n\n\"You understand, of course,\" said Walters, trying to soften the major's\nflat statement.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Devers easily. \"Still, if you need my help on this\nthing at all, don't fail to call me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Carter,\" said Walters. \"You've been a great help already.\"\n\nShaking hands all around and wishing them well, Devers left the office.\nDave Barret, Commander Walters, and Professor Hemmingwell turned to\ntheir study of the map, but Major Connel remained where he was, rubbing\nhis chin thoughtfully. He shook his head as if to brush an impossible\nidea out of his mind and then turned to the map.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro stood at rigid attention in their\ndormitory room, backs ramrod straight, eyes front, hands stiffly at\ntheir sides. Captain Steve Strong, his face red and voice hoarse, strode\nup and down in front of them.\n\n\"And another thing!\" he roared. \"This court reprimand goes on your\nofficial records, and you're going to spend your time on guard duty like\nany common Earthworm that doesn't know its rocket from its pocket!\" For\nnearly half an hour the cadets had listened to their unit instructor\nbawl them out. \"When I think,\" he continued, \"when I _think_ of how\nclose you three space brats came to getting kicked out of the Academy--\"\nWords seemed to fail the young captain momentarily and he slumped on one\nof the bunks and looked at the row of cadets, shaking his head. \"Why, in\nthe name of Saturn, I ever accepted the responsibility of making you\nthree bird brains into cadets is beyond me. And to think that when you\nfirst came here, I thought you had that special something to make you an\noutstanding unit. I even went out on a limb for you. And now you pull a\nstunt like this.\"\n\nBehind them, the door opened and a short man, no more than five feet\ntall, but with the bulging muscles of a tiny giant stretching his\nbright-red enlisted man's uniform, stepped inside. He saluted Strong\nsmartly.\n\n\"Chief Petty Officer Rush here to assign the _Polaris_ unit to guard\nduty, sir,\" he announced.\n\n\"All right, Firehouse,\" said Strong, using the man's nickname. \"Give it\nto them. Show them no mercy. By the rings of Saturn, they've got to be\nmade to realize their responsibilities!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the thick little man.\n\nStrong walked out of the room without another word, nor even a backward\nglance at the cadets.\n\nAs soon as the door closed, Timothy \"Firehouse\" Rush faced the three\ncadets, his beaten and battered face glowing with anticipation.\n\n\"Get this!\" he growled. \"When you're assigned to guard duty with the\nE.M.'s of the Solar Guard, you leave your immunity as cadets here in the\nAcademy. From now on, you belong to me. And I'll tell you right now,\nthere isn't anything in space that I hate more, or think less of, than\nSpace Cadets. You get special privileges you don't deserve because you\nwear that uniform. You get a chance to learn to be a spaceman and most\nof you muff it. I've got E.M.'s in my outfit that could blast circles\naround either of you--guys that deserve the chance you've got, and\nfouled out because they can't spell or don't know how to hold a cup of\ntea with their fingers the right way. When you come to me, it means\nyou've done something bad. You're on your way out. And I'm going to try\nmy best to see that you make it--_out_.\" He took a step forward and\nglared at them. \"Report to me at 1800 hours and\"--his voice dropped to a\ngravelly roar--\"you better not be late--and you better not be early.\"\n\nHe spun on his heels in a perfect about-face and left the room.\n\n\"There is only one consolation,\" sighed Tom. \"The _Capella_ unit is\ngetting the same thing we're getting.\"\n\n\"Here we go!\" breathed Roger slowly.\n\n\"I've been thinking about quitting the Academy, anyway,\" growled Astro.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n\"Halt!\"\n\nRoger growled the order into the darkness and unslung the paralo-ray\nrifle from his shoulder, bringing it around to firing position. \"Advance\nand be recognized,\" he said flatly.\n\nNothing moved. Even the air seemed still.\n\n\"Advance and be recognized,\" Roger ordered again. Still nothing moved.\nThe cadet glanced around quickly in the direction of the guardhouse\nwhere he knew there was a communicator to the sergeant of the guard.\nShould he call for help? He decided against it and moved forward toward\nthe noise he had heard, his finger poised on the trigger of the\nparalo-ray gun.\n\n\"Advance and be recognized,\" he called again. As he walked slowly\nbetween the huge packing cases piled outside the newly constructed\nhangar, he saw a shadowy movement to his left. He raised the deadly ray\ngun, and his finger tightened on the trigger.\n\n\"Advance and be recognized,\" he said over the sights of the gun.\n\n\"_Mee-ooo-wwww!_\"\n\nA tiny white kitten flashed out of a gap between two boxes and ran to\nhis feet, purring, rubbing up against his space boots.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Well, blast my rockets!\" Roger laughed. He slung the gun over his\nshoulder and reached down to pick the kitten up in his arms. He began\nstroking its fur and making little soothing noises. He started back to\nthe other end of his patrol post.\n\n\"You're a cute little fella,\" murmured Roger, nuzzling the kitten\nagainst his chin. \"But you almost got blasted.\"\n\n\"Guard! Stand to!\"\n\nStartled, Roger whirled around to see Firehouse Tim behind him, his\nbattered and beaten face clouded with rage. \"Drop that animal at once,\"\nthe petty officer roared.\n\nRoger stooped over to let the kitten run free and it dashed away into a\ncrack between the boxes and disappeared.\n\n\"Manning,\" began the enlisted spaceman, \"the next time I catch you not\nattending to your duty, I will bring you up on charges of neglect! Carry\non!\" Rush spun on his heel and vanished into the darkness.\n\n\"Blasted muscle-bound squirt!\" sneered Roger under his breath,\nshouldering his rifle and resuming his slow patrol outside the hangar.\n\nFor three weeks, Tom, Roger, and Astro, along with the three members of\nthe _Capella_ unit, had been spending close to eight hours a day on\nguard duty, eight to ten hours a day in classroom work, and the rest of\nthe time studying. They only averaged some two to three hours of sleep\nper day. They were dead tired but they stuck to their task doggedly,\nwithout complaint.\n\nAround them, the work on Professor Hemmingwell's project had proceeded\nwith amazing speed. The tunnel promised by Dave Barret had been finished\nin less than five days, with the rail for the monorail spur installed\noverhead as each yard of the shaft was completed. In the second week,\nscores of cars loaded with building materials began rolling into the\ndeserted plain several miles away from Space Academy. Then, one morning,\nnearly a thousand construction workers arrived and built a hangar in\nthirty-six hours. No sooner had the huge building been completed than a\ntight guard had been placed around it. Specially designed\nidentification tags were issued to the guards and workers on the\nproject. Gradually the huge store of cases and boxes outside the hangar\nhad been moved inside, with all but a few of the smaller ones remaining\noutside. The secret work inside the hangar was advancing rapidly, but\nthis did not enter into the thoughts of the three cadets of the\n_Polaris_ unit, nor of the _Capella_ unit. The harsh discipline\ninstituted by Tim Rush and the extra study necessary for the end-of-year\nexams had forced the cadets into a round-the-clock struggle not only to\nkeep awake but to make the class promotion lists.\n\nRoger paced off the required distance, wheeled smartly, and in so doing\ncame face to face with Astro, who was patrolling another side of the\nhangar.\n\n\"I just saw Firehouse,\" said Astro quietly. \"Did he catch you goofing?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Roger. \"I found a kitten and he walked up just as I was\nholding it.\"\n\nAstro grinned. \"I wouldn't be surprised if that pocket-sized giant\ndidn't send that cat down there to tempt you.\"\n\n\"How's Tom?\" asked Roger. Astro, in his patrol, came in contact with\nboth unit mates.\n\n\"Sleepy. He's having a tough time with that chapter on space law. He\ndidn't sleep at all last night.\"\n\n\"He better keep awake,\" said Roger. \"That little fireman's got his\nrockets hot tonight. He'll blast Tom sure if--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Astro suddenly, looking off into the darkness.\n\"What was that?\"\n\nRoger spun around, his rifle in his hands, ready to fire. \"What is it?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Astro in a whisper. \"I thought I saw something\nmove inside the hangar.\" He pointed to a large window. \"Sort of a shadow\nagainst the frosted glass.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sure.\"\n\n\"I'll investigate. You get Tom and call Firehouse.\"\n\n\"Right,\" replied Astro, and raced down the path, alongside the hangar.\n\nGrasping his rifle firmly, Roger inched toward a nearby door. He opened\nit a crack, then flattened himself against the wall and watched Astro\nrun toward the other end of the hangar. He saw the big Venusian say a\nfew quick words to Tom and then rush off toward the guardhouse and the\ncommunicator. Tom waved to Roger, indicating that he would enter the\nopposite door of the hangar.\n\nRoger dropped to his hands and knees and poked his head through the open\ndoor, peering around from one end of the huge dark chamber to the other.\nThen, taking a deep breath, he rose and stepped quickly inside. He\nclosed the door behind him and stood still, listening for some sound.\n\nSuddenly there was a flash of light from the opposite wall. Roger\nbrought the paralo-ray gun up to his shoulder quickly and was about to\nfire when he realized that the light he saw was Tom opening the door on\nthe opposite side. He breathed easier and waited until he could\ndistinguish Tom's moving figure clearly, and then walked stealthily\nforward on a parallel line.\n\nIt was the first time Roger had been inside the hangar since it had been\nconstructed and he was not sure of his way around, but gradually, the\nmoonlight filtering in through the frosted plates of Titan crystal\nilluminated the huge forms of the machines around him.\n\nHe stopped and gasped. Without even realizing it, he emitted a long\nwhistle of astonishment. Before him, reaching up into the shadows of the\ncavernous hangar, was the gleaming hull of a huge rocket ship. Two\nhundred feet long, the space vessel stood on its stabilizer fins,\nladders and cables running into the open ports on both sides.\n\nRoger waved to Tom, who had also stopped to stare at the giant\nspaceship, and the two of them met beneath the gleaming hull.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Tom. \"Astro said you saw someone.\"\n\n\"_I_ didn't see a blasted thing,\" said Roger in an exasperated whisper.\n\"That big goof said _he_ did.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" said Tom, looking up at the ship. \"This is some baby. I never saw\none with lines like that before. Look at the funny bulges on the lower\nside of the hull.\"\n\n\"Sh!\" hissed Roger. \"I just heard something.\"\n\nThe two cadets stood silently, ears cocked for the slightest sound in\nthe huge hangar. They heard a distinct tapping sound from somewhere\nabove them.\n\n\"It's coming from inside the ship!\" said Tom.\n\n\"You climb in the other port,\" said Roger. \"I'll take this one.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Tom. \"And remember, if there's any trouble, shoot first\nand ask questions later.\"\n\n\"Check.\"\n\nTom slipped away from Roger and moved to the opposite side of the ship.\nSlinging the rifle over his shoulder, he climbed up the ladder silently\ntoward the open port.\n\nMaking his way noiselessly through the air lock, he entered the huge\nmain deck of the ship and was able to see his way around by the faint\nglow of the emergency reflectors in the bulkheads. Tiny, sparkling\ngemlike pieces of specially coated Titan crystal, they glowed with\nsteady intensity for many hours after having been exposed to any form of\nlight. The deck was a mass of cables, boxes, tools, and equipment. Tom\nnoticed curious-looking machines behind, what he judged to be, the odd\nbulges on the outside of the hull. Ahead of him, a hatch was partially\nopen and he could see light streaking through the opening. He gripped\nhis rifle tightly, finger on the trigger, and moved forward.\n\nAt the hatch he paused and looked into the next compartment. From the\nopposite side, he saw another hatch partially open and the outline of\nRoger's head and shoulders. Between them, a man was bending over a\nmakeshift desk, copying information from a calculator and a set of\nblueprints. Tom nodded across to Roger and they both stepped into the\ncompartment at the same time.\n\n\"Put up your hands, mister, or I'll freeze you so hard it'll take a\nsummer on the Venus equator to warm you up,\" Roger drawled.\n\nThe man jerked upright, stumbled back from the desk, and moved toward\nTom, keeping his eyes on Roger. He backed into the barrel of Tom's ray\ngun and stopped, terrified. He threw up his hands.\n\n\"What--wh--\" he stammered and then caught himself. \"How dare you do this\nto me?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Shut up!\" snapped Tom. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"None of your business,\" the man replied.\n\n\"I'm making it my business,\" snapped Tom, pressing the gun into the\nman's back. \"Who are you and how did you get in here?\"\n\nThe man turned and looked Tom in the eye. \"I have a right to be here,\"\nhe stated coldly. \"I'll show you my identification--\" He brought his\nhands down and reached into his jacket, but Roger stepped over quickly\nand brought the barrel of his gun down sharply on the man's head. He\nslumped to the floor with a groan and was still.\n\n\"What did you do that for?\" growled Tom.\n\nRoger didn't reply. He reached down into the unconscious man's jacket\nand pulled out a small paralo-ray gun stuck in the top of his waistband.\n\"Some identification,\" Roger drawled.\n\n\"Thanks, pal,\" said Tom sheepishly. \"Let's search him. Maybe we can find\nout who he is.\"\n\nAs Roger bent over the fallen man, there was a commotion in the hangar\noutside the ship, followed by the sound of footsteps clattering up the\nladders to the ports. Seconds later, Astro, followed by Tim Rush and a\nsquad of enlisted spacemen, surged into the compartment. Rush stopped\nshort when he saw the man on the floor.\n\n\"Great jumping Jupiter,\" gasped the petty officer, then whirled on Tom\nand Roger. \"You space-blasted idiots!\" he shouted. \"You good-for-nothing\nharebrained, moronic dumbbells! Do you know what you've done?\"\n\nTom and Roger stared at each other in amazement. Astro, standing to one\nside, looked confused.\n\n\"Sure we know what we've done,\" declared Tom. \"We found this guy in here\ncopying secrets from some blueprints there on the desk and--\"\n\n\"Copying secrets!\" screamed Rush. \"Why, you ding-blasted idiots, that's\nDave Barret, the supervisor of this whole project!\"\n\nThe man on the floor stirred and Firehouse ordered the squad of enlisted\nmen to help him up. Just then, there was a bellow of rage from the\nhatch. Major Connel stepped into the compartment, his face a mask of\ndisgust and anger.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn!\" he roared. \"I've been sitting in the\nlaboratory for the last hour and a half waiting for Dave Barret to come\nback with vital information, so we could get on with our experiments,\nand I find that you--you--\" Connel was so furious, he could hardly talk.\n\nHe faced the three cadets. \"There isn't anything in the books that says\nyou should be disciplined for this--this--outrage, but believe me,\nCadets\"--his voice sounded like thunder in the small compartment--\"this\nis the very last time I'll stand for this kind of stupidity.\"\n\nTom gulped but stepped forward bravely. \"Sir,\" he said clearly, \"I would\nlike respectfully to submit the facts for the major's honest\nconsideration. Neither of us has ever seen this man before and we found\nhim copying information from these blueprints. When I challenged him,\nhe said he was going to show us his identification. He put his hands in\nhis jacket to get it, but Roger saw a gun in his belt, and thinking he\nwas going to use it, Roger hit him on the head.\" Tom stopped, clamped\nhis mouth shut, and stared the major in the eye. \"That's all, sir.\"\n\nConnel returned the stare, his eyes meeting those of the cadet for a\nfull half minute. \"All right,\" he said finally. \"I guess it's just a\ncase of misjudgment. But,\" he added scathingly, \"in the face of the\n_Polaris_ unit's record, you can understand my initial opinion.\"\n\nAs Dave Barret was assisted from the ship by the guards, Connel turned\nto Rush. \"Firehouse!\" he barked.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"See that these cadets don't cause any more mischief.\"\n\n\"Yes, _sir_.\"\n\n\"Dismissed,\" snapped Connel.\n\n\"All right, you space brats,\" bellowed Rush, \"back to your patrol!\"\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro left the ship and returned to their posts outside\nthe hangar. Just before they separated to resume their endless march\naround the hangar, Tom winked at his unit mates. \"At least we didn't get\ndemerits,\" he said.\n\n\"Only because Connel couldn't find any reason to give them to us,\"\nsneered Roger. \"What a busted rocket he's getting to be!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Astro quietly.\n\nThe three cadets began their round again, their eyes heavy with lack of\nsleep, their arms and legs leaden, and their desire to become successful\nSpace Cadets more determined than ever. But they didn't know they had\nstarted a chain reaction that would affect their very lives.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"We passed!\"\n\nTom turned away from the lists posted on the dormitory bulletin board\nand with his arms around Astro and Roger pushed through the knot of\ncadets.\n\n\"Yeow!\" bellowed Astro.\n\n\"We made it,\" murmured Roger with a note of disbelief in his voice. \"We\nmade it!\" And then, with the realization that he was still a Space Cadet\nfor at least another term, he turned and began pounding Astro on the\nback. \"You big Venusian ape, we made it.\"\n\nArm in arm, the three cadets strolled across the quadrangle and shouted\nto friends they passed. Occasionally they fell silent when they saw a\nboy carrying his gear to the supply building. These had failed to pass\nthe rigid examinations.\n\nNear the Tower of Galileo, the cadets came face to face with Tony\nRichards, McAvoy, and Davison. The two units looked at each other\nsilently, remembering what had happened only four short weeks before.\nThen they all smiled and pounded each other on the back, congratulating\neach other on passing. Neither of the units had made top honors as a\nresult of their fight and the trial, and having to spend so much time on\nguard duty, but they had passed and that was the most important thing.\nThe boys all adjourned to the credit exchange and gorged themselves on\nMartian fruit pies covered with ice cream. Finally the party broke up\nwhen Tom remembered that he and his unit mates had to go on guard duty\nin half an hour.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tony Richards, rising, \"we relieve you guys at midnight, so\nwe might as well hit the sack right now. I've been waiting for this\nnight for a long time.\"\n\n\"No study,\" sighed Davison. \"What heaven! I feel as if I've been\npardoned from prison.\"\n\nThe three boys of the _Capella_ crew said good-by to Tom, Roger, and\nAstro, and walked off. Tom settled back in his chair and sighed. \"Sure\nwish I was in their boots,\" he said. \"I don't see how I'm going to get\nthrough tonight.\"\n\n\"Don't think about it,\" said Roger. \"Only seven more days to go, and\nthen we go on summer cruise with the _Polaris_.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to get back on that power deck,\" said Astro. \"It'll be\nlike going home.\"\n\nLater, riding the new slidewalk to the area where the huge hangar had\nbeen built, they saw Captain Strong returning from the restricted area\non the other slidewalk. They hopped off their walk and waited for the\nyoung officer.\n\n\"I'm happy that you passed the exams, boys,\" he said. \"And I want you to\nknow Commander Walters and Major Connel think a lot more of you, though\nthey wouldn't admit it, for the way you worked to make it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Astro respectfully.\n\n\"You'll have to excuse us, sir,\" said Tom. \"We've got to get out to the\nhangar and go on guard.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you'd better hurry,\" said Strong. \"After that mix-up with Dave\nBarret, Firehouse Tim has his eye on you. Barret put up quite a fuss\nabout it.\"\n\n\"I still don't see how Mr. Barret got in there,\" said Tom. \"The fourth\nside of the hangar faces the hills, and we three covered the other three\nsides.\"\n\n\"However he got in,\" interrupted Strong, \"he had a right to be there.\nAnd he also had a right to carry sidearms.\"\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" said Roger, \"we've talked about it a lot, the three of\nus. And we decided that regardless of what Major Connel or Firehouse or\nBarret have said, we'd do the same thing, in the same way again.\"\n\n\"I think you're perfectly right, Manning. But don't quote me,\" said\nStrong, his voice serious. \"This is one of the most important projects\nI've ever been connected with and--\" He stopped suddenly. \"Well, I can't\ntell you any more. That's how tight the security is on it.\"\n\n\"But everyone knows that it's a projectile that will home on a target,\nsir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Yes, that was given to the stereos for general news release, but there\nare other factors involved, factors so important that they could\nrevolutionize the whole concept of space flight.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" said Tom. \"No wonder they have this place so well guarded.\"\n\n\"Humph,\" snorted Roger. \"I'd give up the opportunity of guarding this\nrevolutionary secret for one night's good sleep.\"\n\n\"You'll get that tomorrow when we go off duty,\" said Tom. \"And please,\nRoger, no blunders tonight, eh? Let's not take any chances of losing the\nsummer cruise in the _Polaris_.\"\n\n\"Listen! You want to talk to the Venusian hick about that, not me,\"\ndeclared Roger. \"He's the one that spotted Barret.\"\n\n\"But you hit him on the head,\" growled Astro. \"You and your catlike\nreflexes.\" The big cadet referred to a recent letter he had seen in\nwhich one of the blond-haired cadet's many space dolls referred to his\nsensitivity as being that of a poet, and his dancing as smooth as the\nreflexes of a cat.\n\nRoger spun on the big cadet. \"You blasted throwback to a Venusian ape!\"\nhe roared. \"If I ever catch you reading my mail again--\"\n\n\"You'll what?\" growled Astro. \"You'll do just exactly what?\" He grabbed\nRoger by the arm and held him straight out, so that he looked as if he\nwere hanging from a tree.\n\nStrong laughed and shook his head. \"I give you three to the loving,\ntender care of Firehouse Tim,\" he said, hopping over on the moving\nslidewalk, back to the Academy.\n\n\"Put me down, you overgrown idiot,\" Roger howled.\n\n\"Not until you promise not to threaten me with violence again,\" said\nAstro with a wink at Tom. The young curly-haired cadet doubled up with\nlaughter. Finally Roger was lowered to the ground, and, though he\nrubbed his shoulder and grumbled, he was really pleased that Astro felt\nlike roughhousing with him. The events of the last few weeks had so\ntired all of them that there had been no energy left for play.\n\nLightheartedly they stepped over to the slidewalk and were back on their\nway to the secret project.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo huge wire fences had been built around the hangar area now, fences\ncarrying a surge of paralyzing power ready to greet anyone that dared\ntouch it. More than twenty feet high, the outer fence was buried six\nfeet into the ground and was some hundred yards away from the hangar\nbuilding itself, and fifty yards away from the second fence. The entire\narea was also guarded by radar. Should any unauthorized person or object\nbe found in that area, an automatic alarm sounded and in fifteen seconds\na hundred fully armed guards were ready for action. The men who had been\ncleared by security to work in and around the restricted area wore\nspecially designed belts of sensitized metal that offset the effects of\nthe radar. But the fence was still the untouchable for everyone.\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro had now been moved inside the hangar itself, to\nstand guard over the only three doors in the cavernous structure. They\nwere armed with powerful heat blasters. These rifles were different from\nthe paralo-ray guns they had used previously. A beam of light from the\nray guns would only paralyze a human being, while the blaster destroyed\nanything it touched, burning it to a crisp.\n\nAs soon as the three cadets saw the change in armament, they knew they\nwere guarding something so secret that human life, if it interfered with\nthe project, would be disintegrated. Only once before, on a hunting trip\nto Venus, had they ever used the blasters, but they knew the deadly\npower of the weapons.\n\nNothing was said to them. Firehouse Tim had not posted any special\norders or given them any special instructions. Each man who worked\ninside the hangar had to pass a simple but telling test of\nidentification. On a table at each entrance to the hangar was a small\nbox with a hole in the top. Each worker, guard, and person that entered\nthe hangar had to insert a key into the hole and it made contact with a\nhighly sensitive electronic device inside. The keys were issued only by\nMajor Connel or Captain Strong, and should anyone attempt to enter the\nhangar without it, or should the key not make the proper contact,\nlighting up a small bulb on the top of the box, Tom, Roger, and Astro\nhad simple instructions: Shoot to kill.\n\nThis form of identification had been employed for some time now, even\nbefore the wire fence had been installed, but the really spectacular\nchange was in the heat blasters each guard carried. This, more than\nanything else, impressed on everyone connected with the project, that to\nmove the wrong way, to say the wrong thing, or to act in any suspicious\nmanner might result in instant death.\n\nIt was a mark of trust that Tom, Roger, and Astro had been placed in\nsuch a highly sensitive position. They could kill a man and simply\nexplain, \"The light didn't go on!\" and that would be the end of it.\nNeither of them knew that Connel had specifically requested that they be\nassigned to the day shift, when the hangar would be crowded with\nworkers, who, intent on their assigned jobs, might be careless and leave\nthemselves open to instant action on the part of the guards. Connel\nreasoned that Tom, Roger, and Astro, aside from their occasional antics\nin the Academy, would be more responsible than rough enlisted spacemen.\nThe orders were specific: shoot to kill, but there was almost always one\npoor human being who would forget. In spite of the necessity for tight\nsecurity, Connel felt he had to allow for that one percent of human\nfailure. Secretly he was very happy that he had a crack unit like the\n_Polaris_ to place in such a job. And the _Capella_ unit had been\nentrusted with the same responsibility.\n\nIt was under such tight conditions that Astro, watching the least busy\nof the three entrances and exits, saw Dave Barret walk to a nearby\npublic teleceiver booth, and, with the door ajar, place a transspace\ncall to Venusport.\n\nThe booth was used often by the workers and Astro did not think much of\nit, until he accidentally overheard Barret's conversation.\n\n\"... Yeah, I know, but things are so tight, I can't even begin to get at\nit.\" Barret had his mouth close to the transmitter and his voice was\nlow, but Astro could still hear him. \"Yeah, I know how important it is\nto you, but I can be burned to a cinder if I make one false move. You'll\njust have to wait until I find an opening somewhere. Good-by!\"\n\nBarret switched off the teleceiver set and stepped out of the booth to\nface the muzzle of Astro's blaster. \"Stand where you are!\" growled the\nbig cadet.\n\n\"What, why you--\" Barret clamped his mouth shut. There was a difference\nbetween being frozen and being blasted into a crisp.\n\nAstro reached over and touched the button that would alert a squad of\nguards, Major Connel, and Tim Rush. In a flash the alarm sounded\nthroughout the hangar and troopers stormed in brandishing their guns.\nFirehouse Tim and Connel arrived seconds later. They skidded to a stop\nwhen they saw Barret with his hands in the air and Astro's finger on the\ntrigger of the blaster.\n\n\"By the blessed rings of Saturn!\" roared Connel. \"Not again.\"\n\n\"Put down that gun,\" demanded Rush, stepping forward quickly. Astro\nlowered the gun and Barret dropped his hands.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" demanded Connel, his face reddening with\nrage.\n\nAstro turned and looked the major right in the eye. \"Major,\" he said\ncalmly, \"this man just made a teleceiver call--a transspace call to\nVenusport.\"\n\n\"Well, what about it?\" cried Barret.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Astro, unruffled by Barret's screaming protest, \"this man\nspoke of getting at something, and that he was unable to do so, because\nhe might be burned to a cinder. And the other party would have to wait\nuntil he found an opening.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Connel, turning to look at Barret. \"What is the\nmeaning of this, Barret?\"\n\n\"Why, that knuckle-headed baboon!\" yelled Barret. \"Sure, I made a\ntransspace call to Venusport--to the Venusian Atomic By-Products\nCorporation.\"\n\n\"What was the call about?\" demanded Connel.\n\nThe guards had not moved and the workers in the hangar were now\ngathering around the small knot of men by the teleceiver booth.\n\n\"Why--I--\"\n\n\"Come on, man!\" shouted Connel. \"Out with it.\"\n\n\"I called about getting a new timer for the projectile fuel-injection\nsystem,\" snapped Barret. \"The timer is too slow for our needs. I wanted\nto adjust it myself, but the projectile is so compact, I can't get at it\nwithout taking a chance of getting doused by the fuel.\"\n\n\"What about that remark about finding an opening?\" growled Connel.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" called Professor Hemmingwell as he bustled up to\nthe group. \"Why aren't these men working? Dave, why aren't you up\nthere--?\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Professor!\" Connel barked, and turned back to Barret.\n\"Go ahead, Barret.\"\n\n\"They can't make a new timer until I find a way of installing it without\ntaking apart the whole projectile,\" said Barret, adding sarcastically,\n\"in other words, Major--finding an opening.\"\n\n\"All right,\" barked Connel. \"That's enough.\" He turned to the assembled\nworkers. \"Get back to work, all of you.\" The men moved away and\nFirehouse Tim led the guards back to their quarters. Professor\nHemmingwell, Barret, and Astro remained where they were.\n\nConnel turned to Astro. \"Good work, you dumb Venusian,\" he snorted.\n\"But so help me, if you had burned this man, I, personally, would've\nburied you on a prison rock.\" The major then turned to Barret. \"As for\nyou--\" he snarled.\n\n\"Yes?\" asked Barret coolly.\n\n\"You make one more call like that over a public teleceiver,\" Connel\nroared, \"especially a transspace call that's monitored by the idiots in\nthe teleceiver company, and I'll send _you_ to a prison asteroid!\"\n\n\"Now, Major,\" said Hemmingwell testily, \"I don't think you should speak\nto Dave that way. After all, he's a very valuable man in this project.\"\n\n\"How valuable would he be if this cadet had gone ahead and blasted him?\"\nsnarled Connel.\n\n\"It's just another example of how these stupid boys have obstructed my\nwork here,\" replied Hemmingwell angrily. \"I can't see why they have to\ninterfere this way. And they always pick on poor Dave.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" snarled Barret. \"I'm getting pretty tired of being a clay pigeon\nfor a bunch of brats.\" He turned to Astro. \"You'll have a head full of\nsocket wrench if you mess with me again.\"\n\n\"You'll get a receipt, Barret,\" growled Astro. \"Paid in full.\"\n\n\"All right, break it up,\" growled Connel. \"Back to your post, Astro. And\nyou get back to work, Barret, and remember what I said about using that\npublic teleceiver.\"\n\nBarret and Hemmingwell walked off, with the little professor talking\nrapidly to the younger scientist, trying to calm his anger.\n\nAstro, Tom, and Roger were extraordinarily strict about the exit of the\nworkers that night and there was angry muttering in the ranks of the men\nwho wanted to get home. But the three cadets refused to be hurried and\nmade each man perform the ritual of getting out to the letter. Still\nlater, after they had been relieved by the _Capella_ unit and had told\nthem of the incident between Astro and Barret, they headed back to the\nAcademy dormitory more tired than they had ever been before in their\nlives. Thirty seconds after reaching their room, they were asleep in\ntheir bunks, without undressing or washing. Like whipped dogs, they\nsprawled on their bunks, dead to the world.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nSabotage!\n\nMajor Connel, Commander Walters, Captain Strong, Professor Hemmingwell,\nand Dave Barret stared unbelievingly at the tangle of wires and smashed\ntubes on the main deck of the sleek spaceship.\n\n\"Get every man that has been in this hangar during the last twenty-four\nhours and have him brought under guard to the laboratory for\npsychographs.\" Commander Walters' face was grim as he snapped out the\norder.\n\nProfessor Hemmingwell and Barret got down on their hands and knees and\nexamined the wrecked firing device carefully. After a long period of\nsilence, while Strong, Walters, and Connel watched them pawing through\nthe tangle of wires and broken connections, Hemmingwell stood up.\n\n\"It can be replaced in twelve hours,\" he announced. \"I believe that\nwhoever did this either didn't know what he was doing, or it was an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Explain that, will you, Professor?\" asked Strong. \"I don't\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"This is an important unit,\" Hemmingwell replied, indicating the\nwreckage, \"but not the most important part of the whole unit. Anyone who\nreally knew what he was doing and wanted to delay the project could have\ndone so much more easily by simply destroying this.\" Hemmingwell held\nout a small metallic-looking cylinder.\n\n\"What is that, Professor?\" asked Barret.\n\n\"Don't you know?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" snapped Professor Hemmingwell. \"This is something I\ndeveloped that only the commander and myself know about.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"So, if you and Commander Walters are the only ones that know about it,\"\nsaid Steve Strong slowly, \"then a saboteur would have thought it\nunimportant and concentrated on the rest of the mechanism.\"\n\n\"Looks that way,\" mused Connel. \"But there is still the possibility that\nit was an accident, as the professor said.\"\n\nStrong looked at Connel questioningly and then back to the wreckage. The\nunit had been hurled from the upper deck of the spaceship, down to the\nmain deck, and it looked as if someone had trampled on its delicate\nworks.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I'll have a crew put right to work on this,\" said Hemmingwell.\n\n\"Commander,\" Connel suddenly announced, \"I'm going ahead with my trip to\nMars to inspect the testing receivers. I don't think this incident is\nserious enough for me to delay leaving, and if Professor Hemmingwell and\nhis men can get this unit back in operation in twelve hours, then\nthere's very little time lost and we can go ahead with the tests on\nschedule.\"\n\n\"All right, Lou,\" said Walters. \"Do whatever you think best. I'll have a\nship made ready for you at the Academy spaceport any time you want to\nleave.\"\n\nConnel nodded his thanks. \"I think I'll take the _Polaris_, with Cadet\nCorbett along as second pilot,\" he said. \"I'm getting too old to make a\nsolo hop in a scout all the way to Mars. I need my rest.\" He grinned\nslyly at Walters.\n\n\"Rest,\" Walters snorted. \"If I know you, Lou Connel, you'll be up all\nnight working out standard operational procedures for the space\nprojectiles.\" He turned to Strong. \"He's so sure this will work that\nhe's already writing a preliminary handbook for the enlisted personnel.\"\n\nStrong turned and looked at the major, amazed. Every day he learned more\nand more about the space-hardened veteran.\n\nConnel turned to Strong. \"Will you give Corbett the order to be ready at\n0600 hours tomorrow morning, Steve?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly, Lou,\" replied Strong.\n\nAs the major turned away, Walters called after him, \"Take it easy.\"\n\nLeaving Hemmingwell and Barret to take care of clearing away the\nwreckage, Strong and Walters climbed out of the ship, left the hangar,\nand headed for the Academy.\n\n\"Do you think it was sabotage, sir?\" asked Strong, as they rode on the\nslidewalk.\n\n\"I don't know, Steve,\" said the commander. \"If that special unit of\nHemmingwell's had been damaged, I would say it might have been an\naccident. But the things that were damaged would have put the whole\nworks out of commission if we didn't have that unit.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Strong grimly. \"So the man who did it thought he was\ndoing a complete job.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Walters. \"Assuming that it was sabotage.\"\n\n\"Anyone you suspect?\"\n\n\"Not a living soul,\" replied Walters. \"Every man in that hangar has been\ncarefully screened by our Security Section. Background, history,\neverything. No, I think it really was an accident.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Strong, but not with the conviction he would like to\nhave felt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPat Troy had been Professor Hemmingwell's foreman for nearly two years.\nIt was his job to read the complicated blueprints and keep the\nconstruction and installation work proceeding on schedule. Troy lacked a\nformal education, but nevertheless he could read and interpret the\ncomplicated plans which the professor and his assistants drew up, and\ntransform their ideas into actual mechanical devices. Professor\nHemmingwell considered himself fortunate to have a man of Troy's ability\nnot only as a co-worker, but as a close friend.\n\nBut Dave Barret did not like Troy, and he made this dislike obvious by\ngiving Troy as much work as possible, mainly tasks that were beneath his\nability, claiming he only trusted the trained scientists. Barret put the\nprofessor in the position of having to defend one to the other. He\nneeded both men, both being excellent in their respective fields, and\nfound it more and more difficult to maintain any kind of peaceful\nrelationship between them. Barret, as Hemmingwell's chief assistant and\nsupervisor of the project, was naturally superior in rank to Troy, and\nmade the most of it. A placid, easy-going man, Troy took Barret's gibes\nand caustic comments in silence, doing his work and getting it finished\non time. But occasionally he had difficulty in controlling his\nresentment.\n\nThe day after the accident, or sabotage attempt on the firing unit, the\nhangar was quiet, most of the workers still being psychographed. Troy,\none of the first to be graphed, had been detained by the technicians\nlonger than usual, but was now back at his bench, working on the unit.\nThis incident gave Barret the opportunity he was looking for, and as he\nand Professor Hemmingwell strode through the hangar, he commented\ncasually, \"I hate to say this, sir, but I don't like the way Troy has\nbeen acting lately.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Dave?\" asked Hemmingwell.\n\n\"I depend a great deal on instinct,\" replied Barret. \"And as good as\nTroy's work has been, I feel the man is hiding something.\"\n\n\"Come now, Dave,\" snorted the professor. \"I've known him a long time. I\nthink you're being a little harsh.\"\n\nAs Barret shrugged and didn't reply, a troubled expression crossed\nHemmingwell's face. \"But at the same time,\" he said slowly, \"if you have\nany reservations, I don't suppose it would hurt to keep an eye on him.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" agreed Barret eagerly. \"That's just what I was thinking.\"\n\nThey reached the workbench where Troy, a small man with powerful arms\nand shoulders, was working on a complicated array of wires and vacuum\ntubes. He looked up, nodded casually at the two men, and indicated the\ninstrument.\n\n\"Here it is, Professor,\" he said. \"All ready to go. But I had a little\ntrouble fitting that coil where the blueprints called for it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Barret demanded. \"I designed that coil myself. Isn't it a little\nodd that a coil I designed, and the professor O.K.'d, should not fit?\"\n\n\"I don't care who designed it,\" said Troy easily. \"It didn't fit where\nthe blueprint indicated. I had to redesign it.\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" said Professor Hemmingwell, sensing trouble. \"Take it easy,\nboys.\"\n\n\"Professor,\" Barret exploded, \"I insist that you fire this man!\"\n\n\"Fire me!\" exclaimed Troy angrily. \"Why, you space crawler, you're the\none who should be fired. I saw you come back to the hangar the other\nnight alone and....\"\n\n\"Of course I did!\" snapped Barret. \"I was sent down here to get\ninformation about--\" He stopped suddenly and eyed Troy. \"Wait a minute.\nHow could you see me down here? What were you doing here?\"\n\n\"Why--I--\" Troy hesitated. \"I came down to check over some equipment.\"\n\n\"Why were you detained at the psychograph tests this morning?\" demanded\nBarret.\n\n\"None of your business!\" shouted Troy. \"I was doing my job. That's all.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" snapped Barret. \"Professor, here is your sabotage agent. Who\nare you working for, Troy?\"\n\n\"None of your business,\" stammered Troy, seemingly confused. \"I mean,\nI'm not working for anyone.\"\n\n\"There! You see, Professor!\" shouted Barret.\n\n\"I think you'd better explain yourself, Pat,\" said the professor,\nlooking troubled and suspicious. \"Why were you detained so long this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"They were asking me questions.\"\n\n\"What kind of questions?\" demanded Barret.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to tell you.\"\n\n\"What were you doing here the other night?\" pursued Barret. \"The night\nyou saw me here.\"\n\n\"I came down to check our supplies. I knew that we were running short on\ncertain equipment.\"\n\n\"What kind of things?\" demanded the professor.\n\n\"Well, the timers on the oscillators,\" Troy replied. \"I knew we would\nneed them for the new units you and Commander Walters were planning.\"\n\n\"Guard!\" shouted Barret suddenly. \"Guard!\" He turned and called to Roger\nand Astro, who were standing guard at the doors. They both came running\nup, their blasters held at ready.\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded Astro. \"What's going on here?\"\n\n\"Arrest that man!\" shouted Barret. Astro and Roger looked questioningly\nat Troy. They did not know him personally but had seen him around the\nhangar and knew that he worked closely with the professor and Barret.\n\nStill vaguely distrustful of Barret's behavior, Astro turned to\nHemmingwell. \"How about it, Professor?\" he asked. \"Do we haul this guy\nin?\"\n\nHemmingwell looked at Troy steadily. \"Pat, you knew about that new unit\nI was building?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Troy forthrightly. \"I accidentally overheard you and\nCommander Walters discussing it. From what you said about it, I knew you\nwould need new timers for the oscillators--\"\n\nRoger and Astro had heard about the vital unit that had not been\ndestroyed, and realized that Troy was admitting to knowledge he\nshouldn't have had. Roger raised the blaster menacingly. \"All right,\nbuster!\" he growled. \"Move this way and move slowly.\"\n\n\"Professor,\" exclaimed Troy, \"you're not going to let them--!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Pat,\" said the professor, a dejected look in his eyes. \"I\nhave nothing to do with it now. You should have told me that you knew\nabout the new unit. And the fact that you were here the night it was\ndestroyed, well--\" He shrugged meaningfully and turned away.\n\n\"All right, buster,\" growled Astro, \"do you move or do I move you? It\nmakes no difference to me.\"\n\nTroy took a look at the blasters leveled at him and silently walked\nbetween them to the hangar door. Barret and Professor Hemmingwell\nremained at the workbench, following the trio with their eyes.\n\nLater, after Troy had been safely locked in the Academy brig, Firehouse\nTim Rush sat at his desk in the small security shack taking down the two\ncadets' reports.\n\n\"... And upon the orders of Dave Barret and Professor Hummingbird--\"\nRoger was saying.\n\n\"Hemmingwell,\" snapped Firehouse. \"_Hemmingwell_.\"\n\n\"--Hemmingwell\"--nodded Roger with a wink at Astro--\"we brought the\nsuspect to the officer of the guard, Firehouse Tim Rush.\"\n\n\"Can that Firehouse, ya squirt!\" growled Rush. \"Only my friends can call\nme that. And you two are not in that classification.\"\n\n\"O.K., Fireman,\" said Roger. \"I can call you Fireman, can't I? After\nall, you are a pretty hot rocket, and--\"\n\n\"Get back to your posts!\" roared Firehouse Tim in his loudest voice.\n\nRoger and Astro grinned and hurried out of the small building. Before\nresuming their posts in the hangar, the two cadets stopped at an\nautomatic soda dispenser. As they drank slowly, they looked around the\nhangar. The project was back in full operation now. The workers that\nhad been cleared had heard about the arrest of their foreman, and there\nseemed to be more talk than work.\n\nDave Barret walked over to Roger and Astro. Nodding in a surprisingly\nfriendly fashion, he said, \"I want to commend you two boys on your good\nwork a while ago. I think that traitor would have tried anything if you\nhadn't been there. He might even have tried to kill me or the\nprofessor.\"\n\nRoger and Astro mumbled curt thanks for the compliment.\n\nBarret looked at them quizzically. \"No need for us to be angry with each\nother,\" he said smoothly. \"I realize that when we had our two little\nrun-ins you were carrying out your duties, and I apologize for behaving\nthe way I did. How about it? Can we shake and forget it?\" He held out\nhis hand. Astro and Roger looked at each other and shrugged, each in\nturn, taking the young man's hand.\n\n\"You know,\" said Barret, \"I've heard a lot about you three cadets of the\n_Polaris_ unit. Especially you, Manning. I understand that you know\nalmost as much about electronics as your instructor at the Academy.\"\n\nRoger grinned shyly. \"I like my work.\"\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" roared Astro. \"That's the first time I have ever\nheard Manning accept a compliment gracefully.\" The big Venusian turned\nto Barret. \"He is not only the finest astrogator in the whole high,\nwide, and deep,\" he said sincerely, \"but he could have had a wonderful\ncareer in electronics if he didn't want to be a rocket jockey with me\nand Corbett.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" murmured Barret politely. \"Well, Manning, you must have\nsome ideas about the work that's going on here.\"\n\n\"I sure have,\" said Roger. \"And I see a lot of things here that could be\ndone a lot easier.\"\n\n\"Hum,\" mused Barret. \"You know something. I think I might be able to\nrelieve you two of guard duty. After all, if Corbett can get out of it,\nI don't see why I can't put your talents to work for us here. How about\nit?\"\n\nBoth boys almost jumped straight up in the air.\n\n\"That would be terrific, Mr. Barret!\" exclaimed Astro.\n\n\"Call me Dave, Astro. We're friends now, remember?\"\n\n\"Sure, Dave,\" stuttered Astro. \"But listen, we'd do anything to be taken\noff this detail and get Firehouse off our necks.\"\n\nBarret smiled. \"All right. I'll see what I can do.\" He turned and walked\noff, giving them a friendly wave in parting.\n\nAstro and Roger could hardly believe their luck. They returned to their\nposts and took up guard duty again with light hearts.\n\nIn his small private office, Barret watched them through the open door\nto the hangar and then turned to his desk, to pick up the recently\ninstalled private audioceiver. He asked for a private number in a small\ncity on Mars, and then admonished the operator, \"This is a security\ncall, miss. Disconnect your circuit and do not listen in. Failure to\ncomply will result in your immediate dismissal and possible criminal\nprosecution.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the operator respectfully.\n\nThere was a distinct click and Barret heard a gruff voice.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"This is Barret,\" the young designer whispered. \"Everything's going fine\ndown here. I just had the foreman arrested to throw them off the track,\nand I have a plan to get rid of two of these nosy cadets.\" Barret\nlistened a minute and then continued. \"Connel and the other cadet,\nCorbett, have gone to Mars to inspect the receivers. Don't worry about a\nthing. This ship will never get off the ground. And if it does, it will\nnever fire a projectile.\"\n\nBarret hung up and returned to the open door. He waved at Roger and\nAstro on the other side of the hangar and the two cadets waved back.\n\n\"Like lambs to the slaughter,\" he said to himself.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\"Sound off, Corbett!\"\n\nSeated in the pilot's chair on the control deck of the rocket cruiser\n_Polaris_, Major Connel bellowed the order into the intercom as he\nscanned the many dials on the huge control board.\n\n\"One minute to touchdown, sir,\" reported Tom over the intercom from the\nradar bridge of the _Polaris_.\n\n\"One minute to touchdown,\" repeated Connel. \"Right!\"\n\nConnel reached for the switches and levers that would bring the giant\nship to rest on the red planet of Mars. Even after his many years in the\nSolar Guard and thousands of space flights, landing a rocket ship was\nstill a thrill to the veteran spaceman, and knowing that he had a good\nman on the radar deck made it even more exciting and demanding of his\nskill.\n\n\"Decelerate!\" yelled Tom over the intercom.\n\nConnel shut down the main drive rockets and at the same time opened the\nnose braking rockets. \"Braking rockets on!\" he yelled.\n\n\"One thousand feet to touchdown,\" said Tom.\n\nConnel watched the dials spinning before him.\n\n\"Seven hundred and fifty feet to touchdown,\" reported Tom.\n\n\"Keep counting, Corbett!\" yelled Connel enthusiastically.\n\n\"Five hundred feet!\"\n\nConnel quickly cut back the nose braking rockets and again opened the\nmain drive rockets as the ship plummeted tailfirst toward the surface of\nMars.\n\n\"Two hundred feet!\" came the warning call over the intercom.\n\nConnel glanced up at the teleceiver screen over his head that showed the\nspaceport below. The concrete runways and platforms were rushing up to\nmeet the giant ship. He opened the main rockets full.\n\n\"Seventy-five feet! Stand by!\" yelled Tom.\n\nConnel's hands flashed over the control panel of the ship, snapping\nswitches, flipping levers, and turning dials in an effort to bring the\nship to a smooth landing. There was a sudden roar of rockets and then a\ngentle bump.\n\n\"Touchdown!\" roared Connel.\n\nHe flipped off the main switches on the control board, spun around in\nhis chair, and noted the time on the astral chronometer. \"Touchdown\nMarsport, 2117!\" he announced.\n\nTom clambered down the ladder from the radar bridge and immediately\nnoted the time of arrival in the logbook. He turned around and saluted\nthe major sharply. \"All secure, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Congratulations on a smooth trip, Corbett,\" Connel said. \"And thanks\nfor letting me take her in. I know it's unusual to have the senior\nofficer take over the ship, but once in a while I get the urge to put my\nhands on those controls and--well--\" Connel paused, fumbling for words.\n\nTom was so startled by the major's stumbling attempt to explain his\nfeelings, he felt himself blush. He had always suspected the major of\nbeing a rocket jockey at heart and now he was certain. But he would\nnever tell anyone, not even Roger and Astro about this incident. It was\nsomething he knew that he himself would feel if he ever got to be as old\nas Major Connel and had reached his position. There passed between the\nofficer and the cadet a sudden feeling of mutual understanding.\n\n\"I understand, sir,\" said Tom quietly.\n\n\"Dismissed!\" roared Connel, recovering his composure again, and very\nconscious that he had exposed his innermost feelings to the cadet. But\nhe didn't mind too much. Tom Corbett had proven beyond the shadow of a\ndoubt that he had the stuff true spacemen are made of, and because of\nthis, Connel could feel as close to him as a man near his own age. There\nwas never a breed of men who were drawn so close together in their love\nof work as the spacemen and there was no need for further explanation.\n\nWhen they had climbed out of the _Polaris_ and stepped on the landing\nramp at Marsport, Connel and Tom saw that the ground crews were already\nchecking over the afterburners and exhaust tubes of the ship. A young\nSolar Guard lieutenant, wearing a decidedly greasy uniform, snapped to\nattention before Connel.\n\n\"Lieutenant Slick at your service, sir,\" he announced.\n\n\"Lieutenant,\" bawled Connel, \"your uniform is filthy!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I know it is, sir,\" replied the young officer. \"But I was\noverhauling a firing unit this morning, sir, and I guess I got a little\ndirty.\"\n\n\"That is enlisted man's work, sir,\" stated Connel. \"You are an officer.\"\n\n\"I know, sir, but--\" Slick stammered. \"Well, sir, once in a while I like\nto do it myself.\"\n\nTom turned away, hiding a smile. The young officer was expressing the\nsame feelings Connel himself had uttered just a few minutes before.\nConnel cleared his throat, and with a sidelong glance at Tom and a wink,\ndismissed the young officer, ordering him to have a jet car sent for\nthem right away.\n\n\"Take mine, sir,\" said the young officer, happy to have escaped Connel's\nwrath so easily. It was not too long ago that he had been a cadet at the\nAcademy and he remembered all too clearly what Connel could do when he\nwas mad.\n\nWhen the jet car was brought up, Tom slipped behind the wheel, and with\nConnel seated beside him, he sent the sleek little vehicle roaring\nacross the spaceport to the main administration building.\n\nInside the gleaming crystal building, Connel and Tom were escorted by a\nSpace Marine guard to the office of the spaceport commander, Captain Jim\nArnold. He and Connel knew each other well, and after quick greetings\nand the introduction of the young cadet, Connel asked for the latest\nreports on the projectile receivers.\n\n\"Lou, I've got good news for you,\" announced Arnold. \"We've completed\nthe receiver ramps for the test. As soon as your ship is ready to fire\nher cargo projectiles, we can receive them.\"\n\nConnel's face showed the surprise he felt. \"Why, Jim, that's the most\namazing news I've ever heard!\" he exclaimed. \"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"Through hard work,\" replied Arnold, \"and the efforts of a young officer\nnamed Slick. He handled the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Slick!\" exclaimed Connel. \"I just bawled him out for wearing a dirty\nuniform.\"\n\n\"He's responsible for our success,\" asserted Arnold. \"And what's more,\nthose receivers can be taken apart and reassembled again in less than\nten minutes.\"\n\n\"Incredible,\" gasped Connel. \"I've got to see those things right away.\nCome along, Corbett.\"\n\nTom followed the major out of the office and back to the jet car. They\nwere about to drive off to the opposite end of the field when they heard\nsomeone shout to them. Tom stopped the speedy little car and Connel\nturned around to see who had called them.\n\nCarter Devers rushed up and greeted the Solar Guard officer\nenthusiastically. \"Major, this is a surprise.\"\n\n\"Hello, Carter. What are you doing here?\" Connel asked bluntly.\n\n\"Had some business here on Mars,\" said Devers. \"I've finished and I'm\non my way back to Earth. You wouldn't, by any chance, be going back\nsoon, would you? I saw the Solar Guard cruiser come in and one of the\nattendants told me that they were preparing it for immediate\nblast-off--\"\n\n\"Of course, Carter,\" Connel said briskly. \"Get in. We're just going over\nto inspect the receivers and then we'll be heading back.\"\n\nDevers jumped into the jet car and Tom headed across the broad expanse\nof the spaceport.\n\nConnel turned to Devers and said enthusiastically, \"Can you imagine,\nDevers? Some young officer here at Marsport has worked out a way to\nassemble and transport the receivers in a fantastically small amount of\ntime.\"\n\n\"That's amazing,\" said Devers. \"I'd like very much to see them.\" He\nlooked at Tom and said, \"Incidentally, who is your young friend?\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry,\" replied Connel. \"This is Cadet Corbett of the _Polaris_\nunit. No doubt you've heard of them. He and his unit mates manage to get\ninto more trouble than all the monkeys in the Venusian jungle.\"\n\nCarter laughed. \"I've known Lou Connel long enough to know that when he\nsays something like that about you, son, he thinks very highly of you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Tom, not knowing what else to say.\n\nWhile Connel and Devers talked of the problems surrounding the\nprojectile operation, Tom concentrated on his driving. He was following\ndirections given him by Jim Arnold to reach the testing grounds and this\nmade it necessary for Tom to drive right through the center of the\nspaceport, weaving in and out of the dozens of spaceships parked on the\nconcrete ramps.\n\nTom swept past them, driving expertly, heading toward a group of\nconcrete blockhouses enclosed by a fence which he knew would be the\ntesting area. Beside the fence, a short, stubby-nosed spaceship was\nloading cargo, and beneath the vessel, two huge jet trucks were backing\ninto position. Tom steered the car up to the gate and stopped at the\nsignal of an armed guard. Connel, Devers, and Tom stepped out of the car\nand waited for a minute, and then young Lieutenant Slick appeared,\nwearing a clean uniform.\n\nSlick checked their names off against a list he carried and then drew\nConnel to one side. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said, just out of Tom and\nDever's hearing, \"I can't allow the cadet inside this area.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Connel. \"I'll vouch for him.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" said Slick. \"Those are my orders. I can let you and\nMr. Devers in, but not Cadet Corbett.\" He showed Connel a list of names:\nConnel, Strong, Hemmingwell, Walters, Devers, and Barret. They were the\nonly names on it.\n\nConnel nodded. \"I understand,\" he said and turned to Tom. \"You'll have\nto stay here, Corbett,\" he called. \"Wait for me in the car.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom and hopped back in the jet.\n\nHe backed out through the gate, pulling up alongside the fence near the\nstubby-nosed freighter. When Connel and Devers, escorted by Slick, had\ndisappeared behind a blockhouse inside the restricted area, Tom\ncasually walked over to watch the loading operation of the spaceship. A\nfew of the workers stopped when he walked up, and recognizing his cadet\nuniform, greeted him warmly.\n\n\"Space Cadet, eh?\" said one of the men. \"Sure wish I could get my boy in\nthe Academy.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" said another man. \"All I hear from morning until night is\nSpace Academy--Space Academy.\"\n\nTom smiled his appreciation of their admiration. While he answered their\nquestions about the training school of the Solar Guard, they continued\nworking. After a while the conversation turned to the restricted area\nbehind the fence.\n\n\"Some pretty important work going on in there,\" said one of the men.\n\"But how come they wouldn't let you go in?\"\n\n\"I haven't been cleared by security,\" replied Tom. \"It's top secret.\"\n\n\"Secret,\" said a man who had just joined the group. Tom had noticed him\nbefore, climbing out of one of the huge jet trucks parked near the gate.\n\"Why, there ain't nothing secret about what's going on in there,\" he\ncontinued.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" asked Tom alertly.\n\n\"Why, we all know about it, Cadet,\" said one of the first men Tom had\nspoken to. \"They're building receivers for cargo projectiles.\"\n\nTom gulped in surprise. \"But how did you know?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why, it's the only thing we've been talking about down at the garage\nand at Sloppy Sam's, the jet-truckers hangout,\" replied the trucker.\n\"If this thing works, surface transportation will be finished.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" asserted another worker. \"The whole industry will be\nwiped out overnight. Nobody will have anything trucked any more.\nCargo'll be loaded into a projectile and shot off into space to a\npassing freighter. Then the freighter carries it to its destination and\nshoots it back down to a receiver.\"\n\n\"But how could you know all this?\" asked Tom. \"It is one of the Solar\nGuard's most closely guarded secrets.\"\n\n\"It's all over Mars,\" declared the truck driver with a derisive laugh.\n\"Why, everybody knows it.\"\n\nSuddenly one of the men yelled and pointed toward the fence. The jet\ntruck parked near the gate was rolling forward slowly. As Tom and the\nmen watched in horror, the giant vehicle crashed through the fence and\nrolled into the restricted area, picking up speed.\n\nIn a flash Tom was inside the jet car, driving right through the hole in\nthe fence and speeding after the huge machine. Around him, guards were\nrunning after the truck, shouting frantic warnings. Far ahead of him,\nTom saw Major Connel and Devers standing near several receivers lined up\noutside a blockhouse. The truck was rolling straight toward them.\nHearing the shouts of alarm, the two men turned and saw their danger.\nDevers immediately jumped into the safety of the blockhouse, but Connel\nstumbled and fell heavily. Tom's blood ran cold. He saw that the major\nhad struck his head against one of the receivers and he lay on the\nground, dazed and unable to move.\n\nTom jammed the accelerator of the tiny jet car to the floor and shot\nahead like a rocket. He was alongside the truck now, but the distance\nbetween the huge machine and Connel was narrowing rapidly. Tom clenched\nhis teeth and urged the little car on faster. He knew that there was not\nenough time for him to jump into the truck and pull the brake. There\nwas only one thing he could do.\n\nRegaining his senses, Connel tried to crawl to safety, but there was no\ntime. He braced himself for what he knew would be instant death, and\nthen to his amazement he saw Tom's jet car swerve sharply in front of\nthe runaway truck.\n\n[Illustration: _Tom swerved the jet car in front of the runaway truck_]\n\nThere was a wrenching crash of metal, a shrill scream of skidding tires,\nclimaxed by a thunderous roar. After that, deathly silence.\n\nFor a second Connel stood frozen in horror, staring at the overturned\ntruck and the tangle of twisted metal that was the jet car. Then he\nlunged forward with a frantic cry.\n\n\"Corbett! Corbett!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"Tom! Tom!\"\n\nConnel knelt beside the limp form of the Space Cadet, calling\nfrantically, praying that the boy would be miraculously unhurt, yet\nfearing the worst. A few moments later Tom groaned and opened his eyes.\n\n\"Did I--did I stop the truck?\" he asked weakly.\n\n\"You sure did, son!\" said Connel, breathing a sigh of relief. \"And thank\nthe lucky spaceman's stars that you're all right. I don't see how you\ngot out alive.\"\n\nTom sat up. \"I jumped from the jet car at the last minute,\" he said. \"I\nguess I must have bumped my head.\" He looked down at his torn uniform.\n\"Wow,\" he said. \"Look at me.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Connel laughed. He turned to Lieutenant Slick\nwho had just rushed up.\n\n\"Lieutenant, I want a complete check on the men who were standing\noutside the fence when that truck ran away.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The young lieutenant patted Tom on the shoulder. \"Good\nwork, Cadet,\" he said and started away.\n\nTom grinned his thanks at the young officer and struggled to his feet.\n\"Sir,\" he said to Connel, \"I think I should explain something about that\ntruck.\"\n\n\"The truck!\" cried Connel. He turned and called, \"Lieutenant, come back\nhere.\" The young officer turned back. \"Go ahead, Tom,\" said Connel.\n\nWhile Tom told his story of the truck having been parked near the gate,\nand having started to roll by itself, Connel and Slick listened\nintently. Quietly Devers joined them. Finally, when Tom had finished,\nConnel rubbed his chin thoughtfully and stared at the truck which was\nbeing examined by a swarm of guards.\n\nA few moments later the sergeant in command reported to Connel that they\nhad found a worn clutch plate that could have slipped and caused the\ntruck to roll of its own accord, especially if the motor was turning\nover.\n\nConnel nodded and then ordered, \"Get the driver over here.\"\n\nThe man that had spoken to Tom about the secret project came forward\nunder guard. He was thoroughly frightened and Connel was aware of it.\n\"Relax, friend,\" he said. \"I just want to ask you one question.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" gulped the truck driver.\n\n\"Was there anything wrong with your truck?\" demanded Connel.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the driver. \"I had a slipping clutch.\"\n\nConnel turned abruptly to Lieutenant Slick. \"All right, Slick, release\nthis man and get that fence back up. I'm satisfied that it was an\naccident.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Slick, and left the group with the grateful driver.\n\nConnel relaxed for the first time and turned to Carter Devers who had\nbeen standing by silently. \"Well, Carter,\" he said, \"see what I meant\nabout the _Polaris_ unit getting into trouble! Blast it, if they don't\nstart it, they sure can finish it.\" He turned to Tom. \"Son, you deserve\nsome time off. Go back to the Spacelanes Hotel in Marsport and get\nyourself a room. Just forget everything and relax. And get a new\nuniform, too.\"\n\n\"And send the bill to me,\" Devers suddenly spoke up. \"It's the least I\ncan do.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom. \"I could sure use a little sleep.\"\n\nHitching a ride on a jet sled, Tom rode over to the administration\nbuilding where he managed to clean up enough to make himself presentable\nat the hotel. Later, as he rode along the curving canal in a jet cab\ninto the main section of Marsport, he relaxed for the first time and\nenjoyed the sights.\n\nThe city of Marsport was built in a hurry--at least, the old section of\nthe city was. Like many other planets, when first colonized by the early\ngreat conquerors of space several hundred years before, the city grew\nout of immediate need, with no formalized plan.\n\nYears later, when the Solar Alliance was formed and there was uniform\ngovernment all over the solar system, the citizens of Mars began to\nregard their ugly little capital with distaste. A major effort was made\nto clean up its squalid appearance and huge cargoes of Titan crystal\nwere shipped to Mars for modern construction. Now, as Tom Corbett rode\nin comfort along a speedway bordering one of the ancient canals, he\napproached the city with a vague feeling of awe. Gleaming towers,\nreflecting the last rays of the setting sun, loomed just ahead of him,\nand the wavy lines of heat rising out of the sandy deserts seemed to\nmake the buildings dance. It was a sunset ballet that never failed to\nthrill even the oldest Martian citizen.\n\nAt the magnificent Spacelanes Hotel, Tom was greeted with the greatest\nrespect. Already his feat of stopping the runaway truck had been\nannounced over the stereo newscasts, and when he asked the location of\nthe nearest supply store to buy a uniform, one was immediately brought\nto his room by the manager.\n\n\"But how did you know?\" asked Tom, astounded.\n\nThe manager showed Tom a photograph of himself in his ragged clothes,\ntaken while he was talking to Connel. In the background was the remains\nof the jet car.\n\n\"Major Connel called and said you would be staying here,\" said the\nmanager. \"From the looks of you in this picture, we knew you would need\na new uniform.\"\n\n\"And you've got my size!\" exclaimed Tom, holding up the gleaming new\nblouse.\n\n\"We called the Academy.\" The manager smiled. \"We wanted to be sure.\nIncidentally, there is a message for you.\" The manager handed Tom a\ntyped space-o-gram and left. The cadet ripped it open and smiled as he\nread:\n\n     TRYING TO HOG ALL THE STEREO SPACE YOU CAN WHILE YOU LEAVE THE REAL\n     COMPETITION AT HOME, YOU RAT! CONGRATULATIONS!\n\n     ASTRO AND ROGER\n\nLaughing to himself, Tom left the message on the desk, stripped off his\ntorn, dirty clothes, and stepped into a hot, refreshing shower. Half an\nhour later he was digging into a thick steak with French fried potatoes.\n\nAfter a third helping of dessert, the cadet stretched out on the bed and\nclosed his eyes. But sleep would not come. The incidents at the\nspaceport that afternoon kept flashing through his mind. He tossed\nrestlessly, something he couldn't quite remember was tugging at the back\nof his mind.\n\nHe retraced the events of the day, beginning with the landing of the\n_Polaris_ and ending with the crash of the jet truck.\n\nSuddenly he sat up straight. Then quickly he jumped out of bed,\nhurriedly threw on the new uniform, and rammed his feet into the soft\nspace boots.\n\nTen minutes later, having used the service elevator to avoid the lobby,\nhe stood on the corner of Lowell Lane and Builker Avenue. He hailed a\npassing jet cab, and climbing in, asked the driver, \"Do you know a\nrestaurant or a bar called Sloppy Sam's?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the driver. \"That where you want to go?\"\n\n\"As fast as this wagon will get me there,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the driver strangely. \"You look like a nice kid. That\njoint's for--for--well, it ain't for a Space Cadet,\" he concluded\nlamely.\n\n\"The first thing they teach us at the Academy, buddy,\" said Tom\nimpatiently, \"is how to take care of ourselves, and the second thing is\nto mind our own business.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said the driver, tight-lipped. He slammed the car into motion\nand the force hurled Tom back in his seat.\n\nTom grinned. He hadn't meant to sound so tough. He leaned over and\napologized. \"I'm looking for an old friend. Someone told me he drives a\ntruck and he might be there.\"\n\n\"Forget it, kid,\" said the driver. \"I wouldn't want you in my cab if you\ncouldn't take care of yourself. We pay taxes to teach guys like you how\nto protect us. A lot of good it would do if you were scared of a taxi\ndriver.\"\n\nTom laughed and settled back in his seat to watch the city flash past.\n\nA half hour later the curly-haired cadet became aware of the change from\nthe magnificent crystal buildings to the dirty and streaked buildings of\nthe poorer section of the city. And with the change, Tom noticed a\ndifference in the people who walked the streets. Here were men who wore\ntheir coat collars high and their caps pulled low, and who would duck\ninto the shadows at the approach of the cab and then watch it with dark,\nsilent eyes.\n\n\"Here ya are, Cadet,\" the driver announced, stopping in front of a\nsmall, dirty building. \"Sloppy Sam's.\"\n\nTom looked out. The door was open and he could see inside. Sawdust\ncovered the floor, and the tables and chairs were old and rickety. The\nmen inside were the same as those he had seen on the street,\ntough-looking, hard, steely-eyed. Tom looked at the faded sign over the\ndoor. \"That says _Bad_ Sam's,\" he protested.\n\n[Illustration: _The men inside were tough-looking and steely-eyed_]\n\n\"Used to be called Bad Sam's,\" replied the driver. \"As a matter of fact,\nI think it's still officially Bad Sam's. You see, Sam used to be a real\ntough fella. Then one day a fella came along that was tougher than he\nwas and beat the exhaust out of him. Sam went to pot after that. He got\nfat and lazy, and his place here got dirtier and dirtier. Finally\neverybody started calling him Sloppy Sam and it stuck.\"\n\n\"Quite a story.\" Tom laughed. \"What happened to the fellow that took Sam\nover the hurdles?\"\n\n\"He's got a joint on the other side of town called Bad Richard's. But\nthey're friends now. Get along fine.\"\n\nTom paid the driver and stood on the sidewalk, watching the silver cab\nshoot away into the darkness. Then he took a deep breath and slowly\nmoved toward the open door of Sloppy Sam's.\n\nInside, Tom saw that most of the customers were lined up at the bar,\ndrinking rocket juice, a dark foul-tasting liquid that Tom had sipped\nonce and vowed he would never try again. But as he looked around, he\ndidn't think it was the type of place you could order anything milder,\nso he walked up to the bar and ordered loudly, \"A bucket of juice.\"\n\nSome of the men at the bar turned away from the stereo screen to look at\nthe newcomer. They eyed the crisp, clean uniform narrowly, and then\nturned silently back to the play on the screen.\n\nThe husky bartender placed the small glass of dark liquid in front of\nTom. \"Twenty credits,\" he announced in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"Twenty!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Don't give me that rocket wash! It's five\ncredits a shot.\"\n\n\"To a Space Cadet that wants to keep his reputation, Corbett,\" replied\nthe burly man, \"it's twenty.\"\n\nTom realized that the man had seen his picture on the stereo news that\nafternoon and that it would be impossible to get out of paying this\nblatant form of blackmail. He handed over the money and picked up the\nglass. He sipped it to keep up appearances but even the few drops he\nallowed to trickle down his throat almost made him gag. He gasped for\nbreath. Whatever information he might be able to get here, it wasn't\nworth another swallow of that stuff.\n\nHe stood at the bar for nearly half an hour, watching the stereo and\nwaiting. When the show was over, the men turned back to the serious\nbusiness of drinking. Two of them drifted over close to Tom and looked\nhim up and down. After a whispered conversation, they turned to him and\npointed to his drink, the same one he had bought and had not touched\nsince.\n\n\"Drink up, mate,\" said the nearest man, a tall, heavy-shouldered man\nwith a dark beard, \"then join us in another one.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Tom. \"One's my limit.\"\n\nThe two men laughed. \"Well, I'll say this for you, lad, you're honest\nabout it,\" said the tall one. \"Most squirts coming in here try to put on\nthey can take the stuff and then they wind up in the gutter.\"\n\n\"That's right, Cag!\" said the other man, laughing.\n\n\"What are you doing in here, Cadet?\" asked the man called Cag.\n\n\"Looking for a guy.\"\n\n\"What's his name? Maybe we know him.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we might,\" chimed in the other. \"We know just about everybody\nthat comes in here.\"\n\n\"Maybe he don't want to tell us, Monty,\" said Cag.\n\n\"I don't know his name,\" said Tom. \"I just met him today and he\nmentioned this place. I wanted to talk to him about something.\"\n\n\"Where did you see him?\"\n\nTom paused. It was only a chance remark that the driver of the jet truck\nhad made and it was a slim chance that these two men might know him. He\ndecided to risk it. \"He's a jet trucker. I saw him out at the spaceport\ntoday.\"\n\nThe two men looked at each other. \"Little guy, with a sort of funny\ntwitch in his eye?\" asked Cag.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Tom. \"That's him. Know him?\"\n\n\"He hangs out in a joint across the street,\" said Monty. \"Come on\noutside. I'll show you where it is. And his name's Pistol, in case you\nwant to know.\"\n\n\"Pistol,\" said Tom. \"That's an odd name.\"\n\n\"Not when you consider he carries a pistol all the time,\" snorted Cag.\n\nTom and the two men walked to the door and out into the street.\n\n\"What do you want to see him about, anyway?\" asked Monty, as they walked\nto the corner.\n\n\"Just wanted to talk to him about the jet-trucking business.\"\n\n\"What about it? We're truckers, me and Cag, we could probably tell you a\nlot more than Pistol.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Tom. \"But I want to talk to Pistol.\"\n\nThey stopped at the corner and Monty stepped off the curb into the\nstreet. \"See that light down there,\" he said, pointing down the block,\n\"the one just above the door?\"\n\nTom turned to look. \"Where--?\"\n\nHe suddenly felt a sharp jolting pain in the back of his head and then\neverything went black.\n\n\"Nice work, Cag,\" commented Monty.\n\n\"What'll we do with him?\" asked Cag.\n\n\"Throw him in the back of the truck and get outta here,\" said Monty,\npulling Tom's limp form into the shadows of an alley. \"I'll get in touch\nwith the boss and tell him what's happened. And you better send out word\nto get Pistol. He must know something.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Cag. \"Gee, Corbett's getting his nice clean uniform messed\nup.\"\n\nDirty gutter water flowed over Tom in the dark Martian alley as the boy\nlay deathly still.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Major Connel. \"Give me that again.\"\n\nThe messenger from the Solar Guard headquarters on Mars repeated the\nmessage. \"Cadet Corbett has not been in his hotel since last night,\nsir,\" he said. \"He was seen leaving the service entrance at about 2100\nhours. There is no report as to his whereabouts, sir.\"\n\nStanding at the foot of the ladder leading to the main air lock of the\n_Polaris_, Major Connel turned to Carter Devers angrily.\n\n\"This is the end!\" he shouted. \"I've had as much of this foolishness as\nI'm going to take. When that young space brat comes back, I'm going to\nthrow the book at him.\"\n\n\"Now, now, Major,\" said Devers. \"I wouldn't be too hard on the lad. How\ndo you know that he isn't in some kind of trouble?\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" growled Connel. \"One of those three is always in\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"He saved your life,\" reminded Devers.\n\n\"I'm well aware of that,\" replied Connel stiffly. \"But it's a personal\ndebt. It has nothing to do with his behavior as a cadet. I ordered him\nto go to that hotel and rest, not go skylarking all over Marsport. This\nis typical of the whole unit's attitude.\"\n\n\"But you said that they were the best crew you ever had,\" insisted\nDevers.\n\n\"I know, but what's worse is that _they_ know it! Blast it, Carter, it\nisn't easy to say the things I've said about Corbett! He's a fine lad.\nBut look at it this way. I have to return to Atom City immediately.\nCorbett may be in trouble, right?\" Devers nodded. \"Well, how do you\nthink I feel, blasting off and leaving him?\"\n\nDevers nodded his understanding as Connel continued furiously, \"And\nfurthermore, I have more important things to think about than\nwet-nursing a cadet.\"\n\nAt that moment Connel noticed a jet car racing across the spaceport\ntoward the _Polaris_. As it drew near, he saw the insigne of the Solar\nGuard on the hood. His eyes widened hopefully for a second. \"Humph,\" he\ngrunted, \"this may be him now!\"\n\n\"If it is,\" cautioned Devers, \"go easy on the boy.\"\n\n\"We'll see, we'll see.\"\n\nThe car screamed to a stop in front of them, the plastic blister was\nthrown back, and another Solar Guard messenger climbed out, saluting\nConnel smartly.\n\n\"Message from Solar Guard headquarters, Major Connel,\" he said.\n\nConnel took the paper and ripped it open. \"Excuse me, Carter,\" he\nmuttered and stepped to one side to read the note hurriedly.\n\n     HEMMINGWELL'S CHIEF FOREMAN ARRESTED AS SABOTEUR. ADVISE YOU RETURN\n     IMMEDIATELY. WALTERS\n\nDashing up the metal ladder, Connel roared the order to the waiting\nground crew. \"Stand by to blast off.\"\n\nCarter Devers scrambled up into the giant ship after the Solar Guard\nofficer, and in less than a minute later, all ports were sealed and the\n_Polaris_ was ready for space. In the pilot's chair, Connel called\ntraffic control for blast-off, and at the same time prepared to raise\nship.\n\nBy the time Devers had strapped himself into the copilot's chair next to\nConnel, the ship was quivering with leashed power. Suddenly Connel\nroared the familiar call for space.\n\n\"Blast off, minus five, four, three, two, one, _zero_!\"\n\nThe great ship literally exploded off the ground, and within seconds,\nwas rocketing through the thin atmosphere above Mars on course for\nEarth, far across the deep black velvet void of space, but leaving Tom\nCorbett, her true commander, behind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Steve Strong and Commander Walters watched grimly as the\n_Polaris_ landed on the Academy spaceport. They had been in contact with\nConnel during his trip back to Earth and had already told the bluff\nmajor of still another incident that had taken place at the Academy\nwhile he was gone.\n\nRoger and Astro had stolen a rocket scout and disappeared.\n\n\"I don't get it, sir,\" sighed Strong. \"Manning and Astro blowing wide\nopen, Corbett disappearing--\" He shook his head. \"It doesn't make\nsense.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Walters. \"But those three are really in trouble now.\nConnel won't stand for this kind of behavior.\"\n\n\"Do you think that he'll go so far as to ask for a court-martial?\"\n\nWalters hesitated. \"I hate to say this, Steve,\" he said finally, \"but if\nMajor Connel doesn't, I will be forced to. No other unit has had more of\nan opportunity to prove itself than the _Polaris_ unit. And every time,\nsomething like this happens.\"\n\n\"But suppose they have good explanations,\" insisted Strong.\n\n\"It would have to be better than anything they've had before,\" replied\nWalters. \"Frankly, I cannot see how that is possible.\"\n\nWalters climbed into his jet car and Strong followed, biting his lip.\n\nThe car shot across the field to the now grounded _Polaris_, pulling\nalongside it just as Major Connel and Carter Devers climbed out of the\nopen hatch. Without even the courtesy of a greeting, Connel roared,\n\"What's this about those two cadets stealing a ship?\"\n\n\"Let's talk about that later, Lou,\" said Walters. \"Climb in. We've got\nsomething more important to discuss. The saboteur.\"\n\nDevers stepped forward. \"This is no place for me, I know,\" he said.\n\"I'll leave you here. And thanks for the lift, Major.\"\n\nConnel grunted his acknowledgment and climbed into the car as Strong\nturned to Devers.\n\n\"There was a message for you, Mr. Devers,\" said the Solar Guard captain.\n\"You're to get in touch with your Atom City office immediately.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Steve,\" said Devers, and with a wave of his hand to the others\nwalked away.\n\nAs the jet car raced back to the Tower of Galileo, Walters brought\nConnel up to date on the incident at the hangar leading to the arrest of\nPat Troy. When they reached Walters' office, high in the tower, Troy was\nushered in by two guards.\n\n\"Sit down!\" barked Connel, taking command of the situation.\n\nTroy walked to the center of the room and sat down in the indicated\nchair, facing Walters, Connel, and Strong.\n\n\"We'd like to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, Troy,\"\nbegan Connel. \"So I suggest that you tell us the truth and save us the\ntrouble of pulling it out of you.\n\n\"I will answer all of your questions to the best of my ability, sir,\"\nsaid Troy calmly. \"And I will tell the truth at all times.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" snorted Connel. \"Now, who are you working for?\"\n\n\"Professor Hemmingwell,\" replied Troy.\n\n\"Stow that,\" snarled Connel. \"Who paid you to sabotage the ship?\"\n\n\"I have not committed any sabotage for anyone, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you deny that you wrecked that firing unit?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWalters suddenly leaned forward. \"But you do not deny that you knew\nabout the special unit that Professor Hemmingwell had created,\" he said.\n\"A unit that only he and I knew about?\"\n\n\"I knew about the unit--yes, sir,\" replied Troy.\n\n\"How could you?\" demanded Walters.\n\n\"I overheard you both discussing it one day.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In the hangar,\" said Troy. \"You and Professor Hemmingwell were talking\non the main deck while I was inside--what will be the radar\ndeck--working. I heard you talking about the unit, and after you left, I\nhappened to find a blueprint on the table. It coincided with what you\nhad been talking about. I looked at it and then thought nothing of it. A\nfew minutes later the professor came running in and took the blueprint\naway.\"\n\n\"Did he ask you if you had read the print?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Troy. \"If he had, I would have told him that I had.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Connel, \"did you have anything to do with the so-called\naccident to the oscillating timing device?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you know who did?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"We can put you under drugs, you know, and get the truth out of you,\"\nwarned Connel.\n\n\"You'll get the same answer, sir,\" Troy calmly replied.\n\nWalters, Strong, and Connel moved to one side of the room and talked in\nlow tones while Troy remained seated.\n\n\"Well,\" said Walters, \"do we give him drugs or not?\"\n\n\"I may be sticking my neck out, Commander,\" said Steve, \"but I think\nthat he's telling the truth.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" said Connel. \"I would suggest that we let him loose, and\neven let him go back to work, but keep an eye on him.\"\n\n\"And you wouldn't give him drugs now?\"\n\n\"No. I'd give the benefit of the doubt to a man any time,\" said the\nhardened space major.\n\n\"All right,\" said Walters. He turned back and told Troy he was free, but\nthat he was not to leave the restricted area. And he was only permitted\nto work on less critical projects. \"Do you have anything to say?\"\nWalters asked.\n\nTroy smiled at them and shook his head. \"No, sir. That's fine with me,\"\nhe said. \"And I'll keep my eye open for the real saboteur--\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary!\" snapped Connel. \"We're capable of handling\nour own detective work.\"\n\nTroy grinned again. \"Very well, sir,\" he said.\n\nConnel dismissed the guards and the foreman walked out of the office a\nfree man.\n\nConnel and Walters turned to discussing the installation of the\nreceivers on Mars, with Connel lauding young Lieutenant Slick highly.\n\"That boy deserves a promotion in rank,\" he stated.\n\nWalters nodded. \"I'll put his name on the list at the end of the year,\"\nhe said. \"If he has done everything you say he has, he deserves it.\"\n\nSteve Strong stood to one side, waiting impatiently for the two older\nmen to finish their conversation before asking about Tom Corbett. At the\nsame time, he was a little fearful of bringing up the subject of the\n_Polaris_ unit, in the face of what Astro and Roger had just done. It\nwas not an easy thing to do, but at the first opportunity he broke into\nthe conversation with a direct question to Connel.\n\n\"Major, is there any doubt in your mind about Corbett's disappearance\nbeing an accident or do you--\"\n\nConnel cut him off. \"Do I think he's AWOL?\"\n\nStrong nodded silently.\n\n\"Steve,\" said Connel patiently, \"I know how you feel about those three\nboys, but tell me, how long can this go on? They constantly take off on\ntheir own, without authorization--\"\n\n\"But they usually have a good reason,\" Strong interrupted quickly.\n\n\"Then why don't they give us the reason first?\" Connel shot back.\n\n\"What Lou is trying to say,\" interjected Walters quietly, \"is that\nCorbett, Manning, and Astro have time and time again committed us to\ntake action, to get them out of situations that they initiated. It's\ntime they were stopped! They are only one unit in this Academy, not the\nwhole works.\"\n\n\"Then I guess you mean\"--Strong hesitated, a lump in his throat--\"it\nwill be the end of the unit when they get back?\"\n\n\"If they get back,\" snapped Connel, \"I intend to see that all three\nreceive solid disciplinary action.\"\n\n\"Very well, Major,\" said Strong. He rose and addressed the commander. \"I\nrequest permission for emergency leave, sir, commencing now.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Permission denied!\" said Walters. \"This is exactly what I've been\ntalking about, Steve. You want to leave to go to Mars and look for Tom\nwhen we need you here on the project.\"\n\nStrong's face suddenly turned white. And then, for the first time in his\ncareer, he ignored military courtesy and turned to leave without the\ncourtesy of a salute or permission to do so. Connel almost called him\nback, but Commander Walters put a restraining hand on the major's arm.\n\n\"Think of it this way, Lou,\" he said. \"If you wanted something you\nbelieved to be right, and it was denied you, how would you feel?\"\n\n\"I'd very likely do the same thing,\" snapped the major. \"And I'd get my\nrockets busted for it by my commanding officer!\"\n\nWalters grinned and pulled the major back to the desk where they\ncontinued their discussion of the receivers on Mars.\n\nThey had no sooner begun their discussion when the sliding door opened\nand Professor Hemmingwell burst into the room, his smock flying behind\nhim, his hair ruffled and eyes wide with fright.\n\n\"The ship! The ship!\" he cried out. \"Someone has blown up the whole\ncontrol panel of the ship!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\"It will take weeks to repair it!\"\n\nProfessor Hemmingwell stood on the main deck of the giant spaceship\nstaring sadly at the mess of wires and tubes, controls and gauges,\nswitches and filaments, all shattered and useless.\n\n\"When did it happen?\" demanded Connel.\n\n\"Less than half an hour ago,\" replied Dave Barret. \"Professor\nHemmingwell and I were down at the far end of the hangar. The men had\njust left for the day and we were planning the work for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Then what happened?\" demanded Connel. \"Wait, don't answer yet!\" He\nstopped himself and turned to a Space Marine standing nearby. \"You! Can\nyou work an audio recorder?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the Marine.\n\n\"Then get a machine up here on the double and take down everything\nthat's said.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the Marine and left the ship. Connel silently began\ninspecting the wreckage. It was ten times as serious as the first\nsabotage attempt.\n\nBarret, Commander Walters, Professor Hemmingwell, and Captain Strong\nwatched the major, their teeth clenched, eyes clouded with anger. Where\nthe destruction of the first unit could have been called an accident,\nhere was tangible evidence of a deliberate attempt to stop the whole\nproject. The Space Marine, accompanied by Firehouse Tim Rush, returned\nfive minutes later with the audio recorder and set it up for operation.\n\nConnel took the small needlelike microphone in his hand and spoke into\nit as the reel of sound tape unwound slowly.\n\n\"This is a preliminary inquiry into the sabotage of the control deck of\nspaceship XX, Operation Space Projectile,\" he said. \"This is Major Lou\nConnel, interrogator!\" He paused and nodded to Barret who stepped\nforward. \"My first witness will be Dave Barret.\" Holding the microphone\nclose to the young engineer's mouth, Connel said, \"Tell us everything\nyou know of this incident.\"\n\nBarret spoke slowly and carefully, describing how he and Professor\nHemmingwell had been at the other end of the hangar when the explosion\nhad occurred. Professor Hemmingwell had immediately run out of the\nhangar to inform Commander Walters, leaving Barret alone to check the\ndamage. \"Then you and Commander Walters and the Space Marines showed up,\nsir,\" he concluded. \"That's all I know.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Connel and turned to the professor. \"Your statement,\nProfessor Hemmingwell.\"\n\n\"It happened just about the way Dave said,\" Hemmingwell began. \"Except\nfor one thing. I cannot see why there weren't any guards at their posts\nthis afternoon. We were without any men at the entrances for nearly an\nhour. Anyone could have slipped into the hangar and planted the bomb.\"\n\n\"Why weren't the entrances guarded?\" snapped Connel, looking directly at\nFirehouse Tim Rush.\n\n\"Cadets Manning and Astro left their posts without leave, sir,\" reported\nthe stocky little spaceman.\n\nCaptain Strong took an involuntary step forward, his face drained of all\ncolor. Connel looked at him, steely-eyed. \"Did you hear that, Strong?\"\nhe growled.\n\nStrong nodded. \"I--I did,\" he stammered.\n\n\"So those two idiots not only stole a rocket scout, but they left their\nposts.\"\n\nStrong could only shake his head in utter disbelief. Commander Walters\nlooked at him pityingly.\n\n\"I knew they had taken the scout,\" said Walters, his voice hard and\ntight. \"But I didn't think they were foolish enough to leave their\nposts.\"\n\n\"Well, they did, sir,\" declared Rush. \"They left about four hours before\nthey were to be relieved. I was making the rounds when I discovered that\nthey were gone. I put two other men on guard right away, but the doors\nwere unguarded for at least an hour. Anyone could have walked in without\nthe slightest trouble.\"\n\nConnel turned back to Walters. \"This is the end! Those two cadets are\ngoing up before a general court-martial.\"\n\n\"Commander,\" protested Strong, \"you can't--!\"\n\n\"Shut up, Steve!\" barked Connel. \"There's a limit to how long you can\ndefend your unit. Face it, man, those three boys have gone off their\nrockers. They're too cocky. This is the last straw.\" He turned away\nfrom the young Solar Guard officer and faced the others. \"Let's get on\nwith the interrogation. Firehouse! What have you got to say about this?\"\n\nThe tough little enlisted guard stepped up and reported clearly and\nrapidly and without pause. When he was finished, Connel turned to the\nguards that had replaced Roger and Astro and each one repeated the story\ntold by Firehouse Tim.\n\nOver and over, Connel heard the same story. No one seemed to have been\naround the ship when the explosion took place. And it seemed that the\nonly time when a saboteur could have gotten into the hangar and planted\nthe bomb was during the hour the doors were unguarded.\n\nFinally, the interrogation was over and Connel declared, \"One thing to\nremember when you are dealing with sabotage is this: if the saboteur\nfails, he might return. If our enemy does not know the extent of the\ndamage, then he might return and make another attempt. So, not a word\nabout this to anyone. And that includes your mothers.\"\n\n\"Major, there is one thing I'd like to add,\" said Barret, stepping\nforward.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"It's about the cadets,\" said Barret. \"I talked to them just before they\nblasted off in the scout. They had a lot to say about your taking\nCorbett with you on the trip to Mars. They seemed disgruntled and\ndissatisfied.\"\n\nSteve Strong whirled on the young engineer. \"What did they say?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"Simply that they didn't feel that they were getting a fair deal with\nTom being taken off guard duty, since he was actually responsible for\nthem having it in the first place.\n\n\"They said that!\" exclaimed Strong. \"But how could that--\" He suddenly\nclosed his mouth and turned away, frowning.\n\n\"But how could what, Steve?\" asked Walters.\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" said Strong. \"You have already reprimanded me too often\nas it is for speaking up in their behalf.\"\n\nWalters lifted his eyebrows. \"It appears to me that you're getting a\nlittle touchy!\" he barked. \"Watch yourself, Steve. Don't let your\nfeelings for those boys get out of hand.\"\n\n\"Blast it!\" exclaimed Professor Hemmingwell. \"While you continue talking\nabout those stupid cadets, you're just wasting my time. There's plenty\nof work to do and precious little time to do it in.\" He turned to\nBarret. \"Come on, Dave, let's get this mess cleared away.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Dave Barret.\n\nAs Hemmingwell and Barret turned their attention to the wrecked control\npanel, Connel, Walters, and Strong climbed out of the ship and left the\nhangar. On the slidewalk, headed back to the Academy, Commander Walters\nlooked at Connel inquiringly.\n\n\"What now, Lou?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have an idea, Commander,\" said Connel. \"I'm going to spend the rest\nof the night listening to this audiotape over again. Then I'm going to\ndo a little digging around.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Walters. \"And I suppose you'll want to talk to Manning\nand Astro when they get back.\"\n\nConnel looked at Captain Strong grimly. \"I want to talk to them so\nbadly, I would crawl on my hands and knees to get to them right now.\"\n\nStrong flushed angrily but said nothing, and as soon as the three\nofficers arrived at the Academy grounds, he excused himself. He walked\nslowly and thoughtfully along, looking at the dormitories with unseeing\neyes and hearing with deaf ears the noise of the cadets getting ready\nfor bed. He could not believe that Roger or Astro had abandoned their\nposts, or that Tom would run off to disappear on Mars, just for the sake\nof disappearing. In all his years at the Academy, Strong had never met\nthree boys who so exemplified the true spirit of Space Cadets. Something\nwas wrong somewhere. But what?\n\nStrong paused outside the huge recreation hall, watching the cadets.\nTony Richards and the _Capella_ unit walked by, and returning their\nsalutes, Strong could only see Tom, Roger, and Astro.\n\nA figure dressed in the black-and-gold uniform of an officer in the\nSolar Guard walked toward him. Strong's eyes lighted up with\nrecognition.\n\n\"Joan!\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Looking for you,\" she said. She had some papers in her hand and held\nthem out to him.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked, glancing at them in the light reflected from\nthe hall, and then back to the serious face of the brilliant young\nphysicist, Dr. Joan Dale, who, in spite of being a woman, had been\nplaced in charge of the Academy laboratories, the largest and most\ncomplete in the entire Solar Alliance.\n\n\"Steve,\" she began, \"I was in charge of the psychograph tests taken of\nall the workers at the projectile operation after the first mishap--\"\n\n\"How did you know about the second?\" Strong interrupted quickly,\nremembering Connel's admonition about keeping the incident quiet.\n\n\"I was ordered to go over the graphs again, to look for any possible\nclue in a worker's mental make-up that would lead him to a criminal\nact.\" She paused and looked up at him squarely. \"Do you suspect me too?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Joan,\" said the young captain. \"But this whole business is\ngetting me down. Tom, disappearing on Mars, Roger and Astro walking off\nguard duty and stealing a scout, and now this latest sabotage attempt.\"\nHe sighed and shook his head. \"I'm tired I guess.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I understand, Steve, and regardless of what Major Connel\nand Commander Walters have said, I'll bet my last credit there's a good\nreason for what the boys have done.\"\n\nStrong looked down at the pretty physicist and smiled. \"Thanks, Joan,\"\nhe said. \"Now, what about these papers?\"\n\n\"It's about the report on Pat Troy,\" she replied. \"When we asked him if\nhe was working with anyone other than the professor, he lied.\"\n\nShe produced a sheet of paper from among those she held and handed it to\nStrong. The young captain took it and scanned it quickly. The paper was\nordinary graph paper with a series of small, wavy lines on it in red\nink. Near the bottom of the paper, there was a jagged peak in the wavy\nline. \"What does this mean?\" he asked, pointing to the peak.\n\n\"That was his reaction when he was asked if he worked for anyone else.\"\n\n\"Does that mean it's a lie?\"\n\n\"Yes. All the waves that you see,\" she continued, pointing to the line,\n\"represent answers to questions about his personal life. Does he shave\nin the morning? Does he brush his teeth at night, and so forth. They're\ncomparison questions to show his reaction when he tells the truth. That\npeak indicates a lie.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Strong thoughtfully, \"he might be the saboteur.\"\n\n\"Or know who it is,\" said Joan.\n\n\"I've got to get this information to Connel right away!\" said Strong.\n\"Can I have this paper?\"\n\n\"Yes. I made copies. I was just going to take one to the commander when\nI saw you.\"\n\n\"I'll try to locate Major Connel and you go on and tell the commander\nwhat you've found. And Joan--\" Strong hesitated.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Put in a good word for the cadets, will you?\" Strong pleaded. \"Both\nConnel and Commander Walters are all set to blast them right out of the\nservice.\"\n\n\"I'll do what I can--\" Suddenly Dr. Dale stopped, her eyes widening with\nfright. She pointed down the walk behind Strong.\n\nSteve turned around and gasped. Connel was striding toward them grimly,\nfollowed by four guards carrying a stretcher covered by a blanket.\nStrong quickly recognized the outline of a human form beneath the\nblanket.\n\n\"Major,\" exclaimed Steve, \"what--who--?\"\n\n\"It's getting thicker by the hour, Steve!\" said Connel in a low voice.\n\"This is the first time in the history of the Academy that there has\nbeen what looks like\"--he paused and turned to look at the draped body\nbeing carried past them--\"an attempt at murder,\" he finished.\n\n\"Murder!\" said Strong. \"But--\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" demanded Joan.\n\n\"A little man who can tell us a great deal if and when he regains\nconsciousness! Pat Troy!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"Vroom-m-m!\"\n\nAs the shattering blast of noise pounded against his eardrums, Tom\nCorbett opened his eyes, blinked, and stared around him. By the dim\nlight from a small window in the wall over his head, he saw that he was\nin some sort of metal enclosure. Suddenly the floor trembled and again\nthe shocking, shattering noises rang through his aching head. He tried\nto sit up but found that his hands were tied behind his back. The ropes\nwere so tight, his hands were almost completely numb. Slowly he clenched\nhis fingers, then opened them again, repeating the process over and over\nagain while needlelike pains shot through his hands. Finally there was\nfeeling in his fingers again and he struggled to a sitting position.\n\nAgain the metal enclosure vibrated and there was another thunderous\nblast. This time Tom recognized the sound.\n\n\"A jet!\" exclaimed the cadet aloud. \"I'm in the van of a jet truck.\"\n\nWhen Tom tried to stand up, he found that his feet were bound. Again he\nwent through the slow, painful process of restoring circulation in his\nlegs and feet, gritting his teeth against the needles of pain. Finally\nhe felt strong enough to push his back against the wall and inch his way\nupright.\n\nThe noise around him continued. Again and again, he could hear the\nshattering explosions of the exhausts and the screaming whine of the\njets. Looking around carefully for the first time, he saw that the van\nwas empty except for a pile of heavy quilted rugs in one corner which he\nknew were used to protect and cushion cargo.\n\nHopping to the corner, he flopped down on the blankets and, one by one,\nhe began dragging them out. There was nothing else in the van that would\naid him in cutting the thick ropes around his wrists and he hoped to\nfind something under the heap.\n\nSuddenly he felt something hard and boxlike under the last blanket and\nhe tore it off quickly.\n\nHe nearly screamed for joy when he recognized a heavy metal toolbox.\nSitting on the floor of the van, he maneuvered the top open, then spun\naround and hopefully looked inside. There was nothing in the box but a\ndirty cloth, and Tom slumped back in bitter disappointment.\n\nSuddenly the cadet became aware of the intense heat inside the van. He\nwas sweating, and he found it difficult to breath. He inched over to the\nside of the huge truck and touched the metal paneling. It was\nblisteringly hot.\n\n\"The New Sahara,\" he thought, a vision of the desolate sun-baked\nwasteland of the Martian desert flashing through his mind.\n\nHe looked around again desperately. The only thing in the van that might\ncut through the rope was the edge of the toolbox. He inched his way back\nto the box and began rubbing the rope across the edge of the box, but it\nwas too smooth.\n\nTom knew that he would have to roughen the edge of the box, so that it\nwould cut the thick fibers of the rope, and in sudden inspiration, he\ninspected the floor of the van. The heavy-gauge metal was scarred and\nroughened from the many heavy loads dragged across it. He turned the box\nover, and with great difficulty, rubbed it back and forth across the\nfloor. Every few minutes he tested the edge of the box with his finger.\nIt was losing its slick surface, but there was a long way to go.\n\nIt got hotter inside the van and Tom's uniform was soaked with sweat. He\nfound it difficult to breathe and the continuous roar of the jets\ntortured his ears.\n\nHe did not know how long he had worked, but eventually, he felt that the\nedge of the box was sufficiently rough to try to cut the ropes. He\nrighted the box, placed the ropes on the edge again and, with a silent\nprayer, began scraping them across the metal.\n\nAfter a few minutes there was a tug at the bonds. The cadet pushed\nharder. There was another tug and the rope seemed to give a little.\nWorking frantically, he sawed back and forth. The sweat poured from his\nforehead, his arms and back ached unbearably, and soon he felt\nsomething warm and wet begin to trickle down the palms of his hands. He\nknew it was blood, but he kept on grimly, and suddenly he was rewarded.\nWith a snap, the ropes parted. His hands were free!\n\nTom hastily untied his feet, and giving the toolbox an affectionate pat,\nrose to his feet to begin the next step in his plan to escape.\n\nThe young cadet examined the entire surface of the inside paneling of\nthe van with his finger tips. He could find no opening other than the\nback door, which he knew was locked by an electronic beam. Without the\nproper light-key adjustment, the door could not be opened. And the vent\nhigh in the wall was much too small to help him.\n\nHe sat down, disheartened. He was still no better off than before. And\nthere was no way of telling where he was, whether it was day or night,\nand how long he had been riding in the jet truck.\n\nHe rested on the floor of the van, the bumpy ride cushioned by the soft\nblankets, and tried to recall the events that had led him into this\ntrap. He remembered the two men, Cag and Monty, and grimly vowed to\nrepay them if he ever met them again.\n\nSuddenly remembering something more immediate, Tom sat bolt upright. He\ngot up and went to the front of the huge van. There he knelt down in one\ncorner and felt the floor with his hands. He found exactly what he had\nbeen hoping for. A large grate, and it was cool! He jumped up, grinning,\ngrabbed the heavy toolbox and carried it back to the corner where he let\nit drop on the grate. It sagged slightly, near the corner. He picked up\nthe box and dropped it again. The grate sagged a little more. Tom got\ndown on his knees and felt along the edge of the floor. The grate was\ngiving way.\n\nHe really began to hammer in earnest then. And each time the heavy box\nthudded on the grate, he thanked his lucky stars that he had lived near\na garage when he was a boy back in New Chicago. Time and time again, he\nhad slipped inside the huge vans after the produce had been taken out,\nto find a piece of fruit. He had gotten into the sealed vans, through\nthe refrigerating compartment, a huge unit beneath the van and connected\nto the cab. Opening the outside hatch to the unit, he had squeezed\ninside and then unscrewed the grate from the bottom.\n\nWith a final hard smash, the grate gave way, clattering into the\nrecesses of the refrigerating unit. Now Tom was grateful for the roar of\nthe jets. It covered the sound of his escape.\n\nQuickly reaching down into the unit, Tom began tearing the mechanism\napart; ripping out coils of copper tubing and rubber connections.\nDisconnecting a pipe, he used it to pry apart the rest of the unit, and\nfinally, after removing the broken parts, there was room enough for his\nbody.\n\nStuffing the heavy pipe in his tunic, Tom dropped into the unit and\nopened the outside hatch. A blast of cool air struck him. The sun was\nsetting and the cadet knew that soon the near-zero temperatures of night\nwould settle over the desert. Tom poked his head out and the air stream\nhit him like a solid wall. He looked back past the spinning wheels and\nsaw a long stretch of deserted road bordering a canal. His view forward\nwas blocked by the overhanging cab of the truck. The small step up to\nthe cab was a foot away. Tom eased back into the compartment again and\nsat back against the wall to consider his next move. He would have a\nbetter chance of not being seen if he waited for darkness. On the other\nhand, they might reach their destination before that and he would be\ncaught. Tom made up his mind quickly.\n\nMoving back to the hatch, he eased himself through the opening. There\nwas a ticklish moment when he had to let go of the side of the\ncompartment and swing over on the step. He took a deep breath and\nlurched forward.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBehind him, the huge thick wheels spun over the road. A slip now would\nmean instant, crushing death. His fingers reached for and grasped the\ndoor handle. Seconds later, he stood balanced on the step, swaying in\nthe wind.\n\nHe dared a glance into the window of the cab, wondering why he had not\nbeen noticed before. He saw Cag and Monty inside, Cag driving and Monty\nasleep. The driver was on the opposite side from Tom, and Monty was\nslumped against the door.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTom realized that if he opened the door, Monty would fall out and\nprobably be killed, but he had no choice. He reached up for the handle\nand tested it gently before swinging down on it to make sure it would\nopen. It gave a little. Then bracing himself, he pulled hard.\n\nThe door swung open and Monty fell out, hitting the pavement and rolling\noff into the sand to lie still. Tom paid no attention to him. With a\nmighty effort, he swung into the cab and confronted a startled,\nwild-eyed Cag.\n\n\"You!\" cried Cag.\n\n\"Stop this crate, or so help me, I'll break your head!\" Tom shouted,\nbrandishing the short length of pipe.\n\nIn reply, Cag suddenly swerved the big truck to one side of the road,\nhoping to throw Tom out of the open door. Tom managed to grab hold just\nin time. He swung back into the cab and struck out with the pipe.\n\nCag ducked and swung the heavy truck to the opposite side of the road,\ntrying to throw Tom off balance, but the cadet was not to be denied. He\nswung the heavy pipe again and again, landing hard, telling blows on the\narms and shoulders of the burly truck driver. Finally a solid blow\ncaught Cag on the side of the head and he slumped over unconscious. Tom\nleaned over him, grabbed the wheel, and maneuvered the big truck back\nonto a straightaway course. A minute later he brought the truck to a\nstop.\n\nTom jumped out and pulled Cag after him, taking a bottle of water from\nthe small compartment behind the driver's seat. He splashed some on the\nman's face, and while Cag moaned and came to, Tom drank his fill. He\nhadn't realized that he was so thirsty.\n\n\"Cag,\" said Tom coldly, when he knew the man could understand him,\n\"I'll beat your ears off if you don't tell me who put you up to this!\"\n\nCag was silent. Tom stepped in and slapped the man across the face.\n\n\"Come on! Talk!\" he snarled.\n\nDirty, his clothes ripped, his hands bloody, Cadet Tom Corbett did not\nlook like the carefree young cadet that Cag had met a few hours ago. He\nwas frightened and began to whine.\n\n\"Talk or I'll slap you silly!\" Tom growled.\n\nCag saw the wild rage in Tom's eyes and began to stutter.\n\n\"The trucking outfit! Just find out who owns this trucking outfit and\nwho would gain if the projectiles failed.\"\n\nTom was back in the cab in a flash. He started the mighty jets and began\nto engage the clutch.\n\nCag leaped up. \"You can't leave me here in the desert! I'll die.\"\n\nTom looked at the man, threw out the rest of the food and water from the\ncompartment, and gunned the huge truck down the highway.\n\nEight hours later Tom rolled into Marsport, stopping the big truck at\nthe first Solar Guard substation he could find.\n\nHe raced inside without cutting the jets of the truck and reported to a\nsergeant seated behind the desk, reading.\n\n\"I'm Cadet Tom Corbett!\" he shouted. \"I've got to get in touch with\nCommander Walters at the Academy right away.\"\n\n\"Stand where you are, Corbett!\" said the sergeant, jumping up and\nleveling a paralo-ray gun at him. \"You're under arrest!\"\n\nTom stared, and then, spinning on his heels, dashed out of the station,\nthe guard's ray blasts spitting at his heels. Jumping into the truck, he\ngunned the jets and roared off into the dark Martian night.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"Aw, shut your big Venusian mouth!\"\n\nAs Roger's voice roared over the intercom loud-speaker of the speedy\nrocket scout, down on the power deck Astro's face turned red.\n\n\"Manning,\" he growled into the intercom microphone, \"if I didn't need\nyou to get me back to Mother Earth, I'd come up there and take you\napart!\"\n\nFor four days the two cadets had been aboard the rocket scout, circling\nin an orbit between Mars and Earth, conducting equipment tests for Dave\nBarret. They had become bored with the routine work and spent most of\ntheir time needling each other, but as Roger said, at least they were in\nspace.\n\n\"O.K., let's knock off the space gas!\" called Roger over the intercom.\n\"It's time to run another test. Want to come up topside and take a\nhand?\"\n\n\"Be right there, Roger!\" said Astro. He set the power-deck controls on\nautomatic, and then, with a quick look around to make sure everything\nwas shipshape, he climbed the ladder to the control deck.\n\nRoger was standing at the chart table, audiophones on his ears,\nlistening for the automatic astral chronometer time-check broadcast on a\nsuprahigh-frequency audio channel from the giant electronic clock in the\nTower of Galileo. All spaceship chronometers were checked against this\nhuge clock regularly, in order to maintain constant uniform time so\nnecessary for the delicate art of astrogation between celestial bodies.\n\nAstro started to speak to the blond-haired cadet, but Roger waved him\noff, listening for the signal. Suddenly he looked up at their own\nchronometer above the control board and took off the audiophones,\nsmiling his satisfaction.\n\n\"Right on the split second, Astro,\" he said.\n\n\"O.K.,\" replied the big Venusian. \"Then let's run that test and get it\nover with.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Roger, turning back to the control panel. \"Do you want to\ngo outside this time?\"\n\n\"I might as well,\" replied Astro. \"Give me a change of scenery.\"\n\nThe big Venusian turned to a locker, pulled out a bulky space suit, and\nclimbed into it quickly. Adjusting the space helmet, he nodded at Roger\nand stepped into the air-lock chamber, pulling the hatch closed behind\nhim. While waiting for the oxygen in the small chamber to be pumped back\ninto the ship and the pressure to be equalized with the vacuum of space\noutside, he checked his helmet intercom to insure a clear line of\ncommunication with Roger.\n\nThe red hand closed on the _zero_ of the gauge over the door and Astro\nmoved to the outer hatch. He unlocked it, swung the door open, and\nslowly climbed out into the fantastic beauty of endless space. No\nsooner was he outside than the synthetic gravity generators lost their\npull on his body and he started into space. Tightly grasping two metal\nhandles in the hull, the big cadet performed a quick somersault and\nplanted his feet firmly on the hull. His magnetic-soled space boots held\nhim fast and he called Roger over his helmet intercom.\n\n\"I'm outside, Roger,\" he reported. \"On my way down to the exhaust.\"\n\n\"Right,\" came Roger's voice over the intercom. \"Let me know when you're\nready.\"\n\nWithout replying, Astro made his way slowly and carefully down the\nlength of the rocket scout toward the main drive rocket assembly.\nStopping at the trailing edge of the hull, where it enclosed the four\nrockets, the big Venusian squatted on his heels, making certain the\nsoles of his space boots stayed in contact with the metal of the hull.\nHe peered over the edge and braced himself in a position where he could\nobserve the individual rocket exhausts.\n\n\"O.K., Roger!\" he called into his intercom. \"Open up number one.\"\n\n\"Number one, aye,\" replied Roger. \"And watch yourself, you big baboon.\nDon't burn your nose!\"\n\n\"Go ahead, go ahead!\" growled Astro in reply.\n\nA long tongue of flame shot out of the exhaust of the number one tube\nand, after drawing back momentarily, Astro watched the tube keenly.\n\n\"You know,\" he commented idly as he kept his eyes fixed on the tube, \"I\nstill can't figure out what's so different about these tubes. They're\nexactly the same as any others I've ever seen.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That's how much you know, Astro,\" snorted Roger. \"Dave Barret said they\nwere using a new duralumin alloy in the tubes.\"\n\n\"Still doesn't look any different to me,\" persisted Astro. \"And for us\nto spend four whole days out here testing them\"--he paused and shook his\nhead--\"seems like an awful waste of time,\" he concluded.\n\n\"What do you care? We're out in space, aren't we? Or would you rather be\nback on guard duty?\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" replied Astro. \"But even space gets dull after a\nwhile with nothing to do. Barret sure gave us an old crate. Not even a\nlong-range receiver aboard.\"\n\n\"What do you want to listen to?\" snorted Roger. \"Flight orders and all\nthe rest of that rocket wash?\"\n\n\"Be a relief to listen to somebody else beside you for a change,\"\nsnapped Astro. \"Anyhow, suppose something important happened. Suppose\nour orders were changed. How would we know about it?\"\n\n\"What difference does it make?\" replied Roger. \"We've got our\norders--straight from Barret. As long as we follow them, we won't get\ninto trouble.\"\n\n\"For a change,\" murmured Astro.\n\n\"Now cut the griping and finish up out there!\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" sighed Astro. \"That's enough on number one. Give me number two.\"\n\nThe ship bucked slightly as one rocket tube was cut out and another\nflared at full power, but Astro clung to the hull tightly, continuing\nhis observations. With troubled eyes he watched all four rocket tubes in\noperation, unable to understand the difference between these tubes and\nthe standard makes. Finally he shrugged his shoulders, and rising to his\nfeet, called Roger again.\n\n\"That's enough, pal,\" he said. \"I'm coming in.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" replied Roger from the control deck. \"And don't fall all over\nyour big feet.\"\n\nIn five minutes the Venusian cadet was inside the air lock again, and as\nthe pressure was boosted to equalize with the interior of the ship, he\nremoved his space suit and helmet. He opened the inner hatch and stepped\ninto the control deck to see Roger staring at the teleceiver in\nopenmouthed astonishment. A harsh voice was coming over the\nloud-speaker.\n\n\"... Order you to cut all power and stand by for a boarding party, or\nI'll open fire immediately!\"\n\nWith an exclamation of startled surprise, Astro rushed to the teleceiver\nscreen and saw a man in the uniform of the Solar Guard, his face grim\nand purposeful. Just as Astro was about to speak, the officer spoke\nagain.\n\n\"Did you hear me? This is Captain Newton aboard the cruiser _Regulus_! I\norder you to cut all power and stand by or I'll open fire! Acknowledge!\"\n\n\"Roger,\" gasped Astro, \"what's this all about?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" stammered the blond-haired cadet. He grabbed the\nteleceiver microphone and called into it rapidly.\n\n\"Rocket scout 4J9 to _Regulus_. This is Space Cadet Roger Manning. There\nmust be some mistake, sir. Cadet Astro and I are out here on special\nassignment for the Space Projectile project.\"\n\n\"I know who you are!\" shouted Newton. \"If you don't stand by, I'll open\nfire! This is your last warning!\"\n\nAstro grabbed the mike from Roger's hand.\n\n\"All right!\" he bellowed. \"We don't know what it's all about, but for\nthe love of Saturn's rings, don't start shooting.\"\n\nCaptain Newton nodded grimly. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Bring your ship to\na dead stop in space and open your starboard air lock. I will send a\njet boat over to you.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Astro.\n\nWhen the Solar Guard captain signed off and his image faded from the\nteleceiver screen, Astro and Roger numbly complied with Newton's abrupt\norders, bringing the ship to a dead stop in space and opening the\nstarboard air lock. Then the two cadets sat in the main deck of the\nsmall scout and waited, their faces showing their concern. Neither felt\nlike talking. They were so confused that they didn't know what to say.\nFinally Roger got up and in a daze walked to the chart table to note the\ntime of the tests in the log. Then he automatically logged the time of\nNewton's order.\n\nSuddenly he threw the pencil down and turned to Astro.\n\n\"Blast it!\" he shouted. \"What's this all about?\"\n\nAstro merely grunted, shrugged his shoulders, and slumped further down\nin his chair. The big cadet was worried. Anything that threatened his\ncareer at the Space Academy made him literally tremble with fear. In his\nwhole life there was never anything that he wanted more than to be an\nofficer in the Solar Guard. And the only way that could be accomplished\nwas by being a Space Cadet. Now he was under arrest. He didn't stop to\nreason why. All he knew was that it was a direct threat to his future as\na power-deck officer in the Solar Guard.\n\nThe two boys felt the metallic thump of something hitting the hull of\ntheir rocket scout. They realized immediately that it was the sound of\nthe jet boat coupling on their ship and they turned to face the\nair-lock hatch.\n\nCaptain Newton was the first to step through the air-lock hatch and he\nwas followed by six Space Marines, holding their ray guns leveled.\n\n\"I am Captain Newton of the Solar Guard, in command of the rocket\ncruiser _Regulus_,\" he announced. \"I arrest you in the name of the Solar\nAlliance.\" The officer handed over the standard warrant that was used by\nthe Solar Guard.\n\nRoger read it slowly. It was a simple warrant for their arrest, on the\ngrounds of desertion, taking a Solar Guard vessel without permission,\nand being absent without leave from Space Academy. Stunned, the cadet\nhanded it to Astro who had been reading it over his shoulder, his face\nwhite with shock.\n\n\"And I warn you, Cadet Manning,\" continued Newton, \"that anything you\nsay from now on may be used against you.\"\n\n\"I understand, sir,\" said Roger, dazed.\n\n\"Then do I have your word,\" said Newton, \"on your honor as Space Cadets,\nthat you will not make any attempt to escape or in any way jeopardize my\nauthority over you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" nodded Roger.\n\n\"On my honor, sir,\" said Astro, gulping, \"as a Space Cadet.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Newton. \"Then I'll let you take the scout back to the\nAcademy yourselves. I'll escort you in the _Regulus_.\"\n\nHe turned to the squad of Space Marines and nodded. They filed into the\nair lock and Newton followed slowly. He paused in the hatch and looked\nback at the two cadets, a momentary gleam of sympathy in his eyes.\n\n\"You'd better be prepared for a rough time, boys,\" he said. \"Major\nConnel is going to haul you in front of a court-martial as soon as you\nland.\"\n\n\"But what've we done?\" Astro suddenly exploded.\n\n\"The charges are listed in the warrant, Cadet Astro!\"\n\n\"But that's all wrong!\" protested Astro. \"We were ordered to--\"\n\n\"Hold it, Astro,\" Roger interrupted. \"Let's stop and figure this out\nfirst. We can tell our side at the court-martial!\"\n\nCaptain Newton looked at the two boys piercingly for a second, then\nturned and entered the air lock, slamming the hatch closed behind him.\nSlowly and thoughtfully, Astro and Roger prepared to get their ship\nunder way. They were still stunned by the sudden turn of events.\n\nThey had no idea what had happened. But they knew Dave Barret was at the\nheart of their troubles. They vowed silently that he wouldn't get away\nwith it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time it was not a cadet court that Roger and Astro faced. It was a\nfive-man board of Solar Guard officers, consisting of four captains and\none major, who conducted the court-martial in closed session. Only the\ndefendants and the complaining witnesses were allowed to be present. The\nevidence the board heard was as damaging to the boys as it was\nbewildering. Major Connel testified to their being absent without leave\nand taking a Solar Guard space vessel without permission. Firehouse Tim\nRush stated that they had deserted their stations. When Roger was called\nto the stand, he entered the only defense he could, stating that he and\nAstro had been operating under Dave Barret's orders. The board\nimmediately called Barret in to testify and his words blasted the\ncadets' case to smithereens.\n\n\"... I have no idea what they were doing out in that rocket scout,\" he\nstated calmly. \"I certainly didn't send them up on any such ridiculous\ntests. If you will examine the exhaust tubes of that ship, you'll see\nthat they're made of standard materials used in all Solar Guard ships.\"\nHe turned to the board, casually. \"No, gentlemen,\" he continued, \"I\ndon't know what these boys are talking about. You can call Professor\nHemmingwell in, if you like. I'm sure he'll vouch for what I've said.\"\n\nAs Barret stepped down from the stand, Astro lunged toward him, blind\nwith anger and shouting his fury. It took six Space Marines to force him\nback to his chair. Roger merely sat, staring blankly into space, a wry\nsmile curling his lips. He clearly saw the trap into which he and his\nunit mate had fallen, and there was no way out.\n\nThe board didn't deliberate very long after the last testimony was\ntaken. When they returned to the chamber, the presiding officer\naddressed Roger and Astro directly, asking formally whether they had\nanything to say before sentence was passed. Roger stepped forward.\n\n\"I have something to say, sir,\" he said in a quiet but firm voice.\n\n\"Very well,\" nodded the major.\n\n\"Sir,\" began Roger, with a glance at Astro, \"this is not a plea for\nmercy but understanding. We are, it is true, nothing but boys in\ntraining to become officers of the Solar Guard. One of the most\nimportant parts of our training is how to take orders without question.\nNow at this trial, we have been accused of three specific instances of\nmisconduct. We can offer no other defense than what we have already\nclaimed. Major Connel and Warrant Officer Rush have stated that we\nshould have cleared Barret's orders with them first, since Barret is\nonly a civilian and has no right to give us orders. That may very well\nbe true. But I submit this for your consideration, gentlemen--\" Roger\npaused and looked up and down the line of stony-faced officers. \"What\nwould have been your judgment,\" he resumed, \"if Dave Barret had asked us\nto do these things and we had refused? Would you have been less hard on\nus? That's all, sir.\"\n\nRoger stepped back abruptly and the officers stirred uncomfortably. They\nrecognized the merit in Roger's statement, and had not the decision been\nmade, there was more than one who might have reconsidered, remembering\ntheir own difficulties as Space Cadets. However, the presiding officer\npicked up a sheet of paper and addressed the boys coldly.\n\n\"While I must compliment Cadet Manning for his admirable statement,\" he\nsaid, \"it does not change the decision of this board. Normally, these\noffenses would be punished by immediate dismissal from the Cadet Corps.\nHowever, in view of their past record at the Academy, it is the decision\nof this board to exercise some lenience. Cadet Roger Manning, Cadet\nAstro, you are sentenced to serve on the enlisted man's work gangs here\nat Space Academy for a period of exactly six months. All pay and\nprivileges to be denied during that time. Case is closed!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"Atom City rocket liner now loading on Ramp Two!\"\n\nThe metallic voice of the dispatcher echoed through the waiting room of\nthe subspaceport on the outskirts of Marsport and the passengers began\nmoving toward the field gate, where the stewards of the ship checked\neach ticket against the liner's seating plan. Near them, a squad of four\nSpace Marines scrutinized all passengers carefully as they boarded the\nwaiting jet cars that would take them to the ship far out in the middle\nof the field.\n\nTom Corbett sat at the refreshment stand in the waiting room, sipping a\nglass of milk thoughtfully and eying the squad of Space Marines. He wore\na big-billed hat pulled low over his face and a tight-fitting black\njacket, the standard uniform of a merchant spaceman.\n\n\"Anything else?\" asked the pretty waitress behind the counter.\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Tom. \"Gimme another glass of milk and another of these\ncrummy sandwiches.\"\n\n\"Well, you don't have to be rude about it!\" snapped the girl. \"Somebody\nshould teach you space tramps some manners!\"\n\nAs she flounced off angrily the young cadet smiled. He knew his disguise\nmust be good indeed to fool this young girl, who met hundreds of people\nat the spaceport every day and could easily recognize a person for what\nhe truly was. Now his only hope was that the disguise would fool the\nsquad of Marines at the gate.\n\nAfter having abandoned the jet truck, Tom had moved through the\nglittering city of Marsport carefully, keeping to the dark alleys and\nshadows. Gradually he had worked his way back to the area around Sloppy\nSam's where, for a few credits, he had been able to buy a merchant\nspaceman's clothes with no questions asked. He buried his cadet uniform\nin the loose ground near a construction project.\n\nThen, staying in the area, he wandered in and out of the dingy bars and\nrestaurants looking for the man he had seen at the spaceport, the driver\nof the truck that had crashed the fence.\n\nHe spent three days in his search, not daring to ask questions, simply\nkeeping his eyes open for the man. Finally he had been forced to abandon\nthe search when he saw a stereo newscast reporting that the missing\ncadet, Tom Corbett, had been traced to Skid Row. He decided that it was\ntime to leave Mars and went to the huge main spaceport, hoping to get\naboard a ship bound for Earth. But the Space Marines were stationed at\nevery gate, examining each departing passenger carefully, and Tom knew\nit would be impossible to get past them. Then he noticed a poster\nadvertising special non-scheduled flights to Atom City, Earth, at\nreduced rates, that would blast off from a subspaceport on the outskirts\nof the city. With renewed hope, he had gone there immediately and bought\na ticket. Space Marines were on guard here too, but only a small squad.\nThe cadet resolved to make his break here. He had no other choice.\n\n\"Here's your milk!\" said the waitress, slopping it down on the counter\nbefore the cadet. \"And your sandwich!\"\n\n[Illustration: _Tom saw that the Space Marines were watching the\npassengers very closely_]\n\nTom paid for the order and took his time about chewing the stale\nsandwich. He knew he had to get aboard the ship that was loading now,\nbut the Space Marines were watching the passengers very closely.\nSuddenly Tom saw a spaceport attendant race up to the squad and hand a\nmessage to the sergeant in command of the squad. Leaving the counter,\nTom walked quickly to a newsstand near the gate, where he could stand\nclose to the Marines. The sergeant read the message quickly and turned\nto his squad. Tom strained his ears to listen.\n\n\"We have to move out of here or we'll never get out,\" he said. \"There's\na Martian sandstorm coming this way. It should hit in about fifteen\nminutes. This will be the last flight. Then nothing will get off the\nground until it blows over. May last for days.\"\n\n\"But what about that cadet?\" asked the man nearest to the sergeant.\n\"What if he shows up?\"\n\n\"Just about all the passengers for this flight are aboard now,\" growled\nthe sergeant. \"Besides, do you see him anywhere?\"\n\nTom turned his back to the troopers quickly and heard the Marine reply,\n\"Naw.\"\n\n\"Then get your gear and pile on the truck outside,\" ordered the\nsergeant, \"or we'll be living in this station for a couple of days.\"\n\nThe Marines quickly marched away from the gate, through the waiting\nroom, and out the door.\n\nTom dug into his pocket for the ticket to Atom City and stepped quickly\nto the gate, presenting his ticket to the steward. \"Spaceman Wilson!\"\nTom growled.\n\nThe steward checked his ticket casually and announced, \"Seat fourteen,\nberth twelve!\"\n\nTom walked through the gate, trying to look casual.\n\n\"Hey you!\" There was a sudden cry of alarm behind Tom and for a moment\nhe was tempted to run. But he turned slowly and looked back. The man at\nthe newsstand was shouting at him.\n\n\"Ya tryin' to steal my paper?\" he yelled.\n\nTom looked down and saw that he was still holding the paper he had\npicked up to hide his face from the Marines. He smiled, reached into his\npocket for a coin, and flipped it back to the man.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he called and walked on.\n\nHe hurried through a tunnel to the open area of the field where the\nother passengers were waiting in jet cars. He slipped into the nearest\none and settled down beside a fat woman. She looked at him archly,\nsniffed audibly, and turned to stare out the window. Tom merely grinned\nand settled deeper in the seat. In a moment the jet cab was speeding\nacross the small field to the waiting passenger ship.\n\nSafely inside the ship, Tom sank into his assigned seat, buckled his\nacceleration belt, and listened to the voice of the skipper counting off\nthe seconds until blast off.\n\n\"Five, four, three, two, one, _zero_!\"\n\nThere was very little acceleration shock, since this was a vessel\ndesigned for the comfort of the passengers. In fact, Tom found it\ndifficult to determine just exactly when it left the ground. The force\nof the drive pushed him deep in his seat, to be sure, but it was a\ngradual pressure and not at all like the sudden violent jerk that came\nwhen he gunned the _Polaris_.\n\nHe smiled. There was considerably less power in this ship than in the\n_Polaris_!\n\nThe thought of the giant rocket cruiser made him think about Roger and\nAstro. He wondered what they were doing and if they had stayed out of\ntrouble.\n\nDuring the trip back to Atom City, Tom kept to himself, avoiding the\nother passengers on the ship as much as possible, taking his meals in\nhis berth. The cadet had a lot of thinking to do. Though temporarily\nsafe, he knew he couldn't dodge the Solar Guard forever. He kept track\nof his pursuit by stereo newscasts which the ship picked up from both\nMars and Earth, and he was pleased to learn that the Marines and Solar\nGuardsmen were still searching for him in Marsport.\n\nThere was one bit of information that was general news to the others on\nthe ship, but of particular interest to Tom. He had sat up in his berth\nand listened.\n\n\"... The report of a sabotage attempt on a highly secret project now in\nprogress at Space Academy was denied today by project officials and\nCommander Walters. The commander said there was no basis for the report\nthat the entire control panel of a new type ship had been destroyed.\"\n\nTom switched off his set and settled back in his bunk. He saw through\nthe denial by Commander Walters. There was no need to upset the public\nand, more important, let the saboteur know how successful he had been.\n\nThough Tom knew who was responsible, this knowledge did not mean much\nwhile he was still a fugitive. He would have to have proof. He would\nhave to have more than just _his_ word and accusation to make his\ncharges stick. But how to get it?\n\n\"Attention,\" boomed the voice of the captain over the ship's\nloud-speaker. \"Fasten your deceleration belts, please! We land at Atom\nCity in thirty minutes. Fasten your deceleration belts, please!\"\n\nCertain he wouldn't be seen by the passengers and crew strapped in for\nthe landing, Tom slipped out of his berth and down the companionway to\nthe luggage compartment. Safely inside, he examined the contents of\nseveral expensive-looking bags, opening them by springing the locks with\nhis knife. Finally he found a set of civilian clothes that would fit\nhim. Leaving a hundred credits in the suitcase, more than the clothes\nwere worth, he returned to his berth where he quickly washed, shaved,\nand dressed in the stolen clothes, steadying himself against the\nlurching of the ship as it made its landing approach.\n\nWhen the ship finally touched down at the Atom City spaceport, Tom\nwaited in his berth until he was sure most of the passengers had left.\nThen he walked quickly out of the ship, head down and hat pulled low\nover his face, to lose himself in the crowded spaceport.\n\nSafe for the time being, at least until the Solar Guard traced him to\nEarth, Tom moved openly through the streets of Atom City and went\ndirectly to the monorail station where he purchased a ticket for Space\nAcademy. He boarded a local train instead of the express and rode the\njet-propelled train in the comfort of the dining car where he had a huge\nmeal.\n\nThe stop before the Academy was a small village that catered to the\nwants of the hundreds of civilian workers at the Academy spaceport. Tom\nhad been there many times with Astro and Roger, and knew of a small\nhotel where he could hide out until he could contact his unit mates.\n\nIt was early evening when Tom registered at the hotel under the name of\nJoseph Cazippi, an engineer from Titan Colony. Safely in his room, Tom\nturned to the window and stared longingly at the Tower of Galileo in the\ndistance, as it caught the last of the sun's rays and gleamed proudly\nagainst the gathering night sky.\n\nHe whirled away from the window and froze as someone knocked on the door\nand a young voice called:\n\n\"Lemme in, Tom!\"\n\nThe young cadet gulped in fear. Someone had recognized him! He wondered\nif he should open the door or slip out of the window and leave.\n\n\"Hey, Tom!\" the voice called. \"This is Tiny! Come on, lemme in.\"\n\n\"Tiny!\" shouted Tom in swift relief. He opened the door and a small boy\nof about twelve stepped inside.\n\n\"Hiya, Tom,\" greeted the boy enthusiastically.\n\nTom grinned his welcome. He and Roger and Astro had met the youngster on\nseveral of their trips to the village and had become great friends. They\nalways had to tell him stories about the Cadet Corps.\n\n\"How did you know I was here, Tiny?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I followed you from the monorail station,\" replied the boy. \"You\ncouldn't fool me in those civvies. Where's your uniform?\"\n\n\"Never mind that now,\" said Tom, kneeling before him. \"Look, Tiny, can\nyou keep a secret?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said the boy gleefully. \"Sure I can, Tom.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm on a secret assignment, see?\" whispered the cadet with a\nconspiratorial air. \"And I need someone like you to help me. But you\ncan't tell anyone I'm here!\"\n\n\"Sure, I understand, Tom. Whatcha want me to do?\"\n\n\"Go to the Academy and find Astro and Roger. Tell them to come here at\nnine o'clock tonight. But remember, don't talk to anyone else!\"\n\n\"O.K.!\" replied the youngster. \"I getcha! You going to catch spies,\nTom?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet, Tiny. But you do what I told you and then hurry right\nback to me and tell me what they said!\"\n\nThe boy nodded and hurried off. From the window, Tom watched him climb\non his jet bike and roar off into the gathering darkness toward the\nAcademy.\n\nIt was nearly two hours before he heard the jet bike return and he\nhurried to the door, waiting impatiently for the boy to come in. When\nthe door opened and Tiny stepped in, Tom sensed immediately that\nsomething was wrong.\n\n\"Tom!\" gasped Tiny, his eyes wide with shock. \"You know what happened?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Roger and Astro--\" the boy stopped, seemingly unable to go on.\n\n\"Didn't you see them?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Naw, I couldn't. They wouldn't let me.\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't let you?\"\n\n\"The guards.\"\n\n\"What guards? What are you talking about, Tiny?\"\n\n\"The guards at the jail! Roger and Astro are on the enlisted man's work\ngang for six months!\" said Tiny.\n\nHiding his shocked surprise, Tom hurriedly gave the boy a ten-credit\nnote and swore him to silence.\n\n\"Now you hurry home, Tiny, and don't tell anyone you've seen me!\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"O.K., Tom,\" replied the boy. \"But what does it all mean?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew,\" said Tom grimly. \"And when I find out, Tiny, I promise\nyou I'll let you know.\"\n\nWhen Tom was finally alone, he stood at the window, staring at the\ngleaming tower, now lighted and shining brilliantly in the darkness. He\nsuddenly felt that he would never see the tower again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"Stand clear!\"\n\nProfessor Hemmingwell's voice rang over the roar of activity in the\nhangar as the huge new control panel was lifted along the hull to a\nlarge hole that had been cut into the side of the experimental ship at\nthe control-deck level.\n\n\"Easy does it!\" called the professor, standing on the deck and peering\nthrough the hole. \"Careful now!\"\n\nNow even with the hole, the panel was slowly pulled into the ship by the\nworkers. Even Major Connel and Steve Strong lent a hand, setting it into\nplace. When it had been securely anchored, a team of technicians swarmed\nover the panel to begin the intricate work of connecting all the\ncontrols to the various parts of the ship, and Hemmingwell and the two\nSolar Guard officers stepped back to watch them.\n\n\"This puts us back on schedule now,\" said the professor, turning,\nred-eyed and tired, to Connel and Strong. \"It was a good idea of yours,\nSteve, to prefabricate the panel and have it put into position all at\nonce. If we had tried to install it piece by piece, we'd be weeks\nbehind.\"\n\n\"Good work, Steve,\" Connel chimed in.\n\nStrong merely nodded his thanks. He was tired. More tired than he had\never been in his life. Not only had he supervised the construction of\nthe new control panel, but he had been working on a special report to\npresent to the Solar Guard Review Board requesting another trial for\nAstro and Roger. And he had spent every spare minute haunting the MP\nheadquarters of the Solar Guard for word of Tom. So, he accepted the\ncompliments of Connel and Professor Hemmingwell with little enthusiasm.\n\n\"You better get some rest, Steve,\" said Connel, aware of Strong's\nattitude. \"I know how hard you've been working these past few days. So\nknock off and I want your word that you will go back to your quarters\nand get some sleep!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Major,\" replied Strong, \"I can't give you my word about that.\"\n\nConnel's face darkened with anger. \"All right! Then do what you want.\nGet out!\" he shouted.\n\nStrong merely nodded and left the ship.\n\nOutside the hangar, he stopped suddenly when he saw Dave Barret step off\nthe slidewalk from the Academy and stride toward him. The young captain\nclenched his teeth in sudden anger. He had talked to Astro and Roger\nmany times since they had been put on the work gang and they swore that\ntheir story of their ill-fated flight was true. Strong could not believe\nthat they would lie. He had been too close to them and had, many times,\nput his very life into their hands. But there seemed to be no way to\nbreak Barret's story. He waited for the man to pass him.\n\n\"Good morning, Strong,\" said Barret, as though surprised. \"Well, how's\nthe genius? Get the control panel in this morning?\"\n\nBarret was annoyed that Strong's plan to replace the control panel had\nbeen accepted over his own. The captain returned his cold stare and\nnodded.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It's in,\" he said, and then added, \"I would like to ask you a few\nquestions, Barret.\"\n\n\"Sorry, haven't got time!\" replied Barret curtly as he tried to brush\npast Strong. But the young captain grabbed him by the arm and spun him\naround.\n\n\"Make time!\" he snarled. \"I want the straight story about that so-called\ntest flight!\"\n\nBarret glared at Strong. \"I suggest that you let go of my arm, Captain,\"\nhe threatened, \"or I will be forced to bring charges of assault against\nyou!\"\n\nRealizing an open fight would be useless, Strong released his grip on\nthe man's arm and turned away quickly. Barret's mocking laugh echoed in\nhis ears as he stepped on the slidewalk and glided away toward the\nAcademy. Behind him, the big hangar buzzed with the sound of men working\nin high gear again. The mighty ship and its specially designed equipment\nseemed at last to be ready for testing. But Strong felt none of the\nexcitement. It mattered little to the Solar Guard captain whether the\nproject was a success or failure. His thoughts were of the three cadets\nin his unit, who were, first and foremost, his responsibility.\n\nWith double guards around the hangar area and even tighter security\nrestrictions than before, the unknown saboteur was unable to attack the\nprecious ship again. But he struck elsewhere. The single track monorail\nthat Barret had run into the area was blocked by an explosion in the\nmouth of the tunnel. Nearly a thousand tons of rock and earth had fallen\non the hangar side, blocking delivery of vital equipment.\n\nWith powerful earth-moving machinery, the tunnel was cleared of the\nheavy rocks and dirt, and all that remained was a general cleaning up,\nand the enlisted man's work gangs had been assigned to that job.\n\nNearly a hundred tough, battle-scarred spacemen from the enlisted ranks\nof the Solar Guard worked in the area, stripped to the waist, their\nbodies burned brown from the sun. Sent to the work gang for petty\noffenses, rather than for criminal acts, the enlisted men as a whole did\nnot mind the work. They were under guard, watched by a squad of Space\nMarines armed with paralo-ray guns, but there was no attempt to make the\nmen feel as if they were criminals. Most of the sentences were short,\nusually running from five to thirty days, with some extreme cases\nserving as long as three months. But no one had ever remembered a Space\nCadet working on the squad, and particularly for six months! It was an\nextraordinary situation and the guards, as well as the men on the work\ndetails, sympathized with Roger and Astro. They realized that nothing\nreally serious had been done, or the boys would have been sent to the\nprison asteroid, where all true criminals were sent. So a true spirit of\ncomradeship developed between the cadets and the enlisted men.\n\nWhen Captain Strong arrived to speak to Roger and Astro, he found them\nin the tunnel, working as a team of a shoveler and a sweeper. Roger\nwould sweep up a little pile of dirt and Astro would shovel it into a\nhandcart nearby.\n\n\"All right, you Venusian pug!\" bawled Roger. \"Police the joint!\"\n\nAstro scooped up the little pile of dirt neatly and deposited it in the\ntruck.\n\n\"Manning, what made the spaceship cross to Pluto?\" he asked.\n\n\"To get to the other side of the universe,\" said Roger.\n\n\"All right,\" interrupted Strong. \"If you two will cut out the comedy,\nI'd like to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Captain Strong!\" yelled Roger. \"Hey, fellas! Look!\" He turned to the\nother men on the work gang. \"We're special characters! See? We have\nvisitors during working hours!\"\n\nStrong laughed with the others, and then motioning for Roger and Astro\nto follow him, walked to an isolated corner of the tunnel.\n\n\"How is it going?\" he asked.\n\n\"Fine, sir,\" said Roger. \"We have no complaints.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" chimed in Astro with a grin. \"The food is better here than at\nthe Academy!\"\n\n\"Give this Venusian bum a good kitchen and he'd go to the Rock!\" Roger\nlaughed.\n\nStrong noted their lean, brown bodies and decided that a little work in\nthe sun with a pick and shovel had done them good. But six months of it\nwould interfere with their work at the Academy and could hold them back.\n\nHe told them of the work he had been doing to have their case renewed by\nthe Solar Guard Review Board and asked them for any special details in\ntheir relationship with Barret that might lend weight to his plea for\noutright pardon, rather than just a commutation of sentence. He wanted\nit clear on their records that they had been accused unjustly, and that,\ntherefore, their sentence was an error.\n\nBut neither Astro nor Roger could add anything to what the young captain\nalready knew. He finally turned to leave, cautioning them both to stay\nout of trouble, especially Roger.\n\n\"Manning,\" he warned, \"your mouth is your big weakness. I'm detailing\nAstro to make sure it stays closed!\"\n\n\"You see?\" gloated Astro. \"You see who the captain trusts!\"\n\n\"Listen, you big bum!\" began Roger angrily, then stopped and grinned.\n\"O.K., Captain Strong, I'll keep on the ball.\"\n\n\"You'd better,\" Astro interrupted, \"or I'll stand you on your head!\"\n\nWith a pat on the back, Strong left them. Just as he was about to leave\nthe tunnel, Roger called after him:\n\n\"Have you heard anything about Tom, sir?\"\n\n\"Not a word,\" replied Strong grimly. \"So far as I know, he's still on\nMars.\"\n\n\"A--a fugitive?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Yes, Astro. The Solar Guard is still looking for him.\"\n\nStrong watched the two cadets turn back to their work dejectedly, and\nthen, sighing with weariness, he headed back to the slidewalk. In the\nmorning he would check the reports of the Security Section for word of\nTom. Then he squared his shoulders determinedly. He would check them\nnow!\n\nHe could not go to bed yet. Not while Tom was still missing and while\nAstro and Roger were on the work gang. He would not sleep until they\nwere free and the _Polaris_ unit was together again out in space!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom Corbett was also unable to sleep. He had spent the night in the\nvillage hotel tossing and turning, his mind seething with plans to aid\nRoger and Astro.\n\nFinally, at dawn, he got up and sneaked out of the hotel. Avoiding the\nconvenience of the monorail, he struck out on foot over the rugged\ncountryside for Space Academy. He had a plan, but the plan required that\nhe talk to Roger and Astro first, and then to Captain Strong, but it had\nto be done secretly. He realized that his knowledge of the identity of\nthe saboteur would be a more effective weapon if everyone still believed\nhe was on Mars.\n\nAfter getting close enough to the Academy to use the slidewalk system\ncrisscrossing the huge area, he loitered on the crowded platforms which\nconnected the hangar, the Academy, and the spaceport. He kept his coat\ncollar high and his civilian hat pulled low over his eyes.\n\nHe was on the main slidewalk, moving toward the Tower building, when his\neyes picked out the familiar close-cropped blond hair of Roger and the\nunmistakable bulk of Astro on the walk leading to the hangar. Changing\nat the slidewalk intersection, he took off after them, hoping he would\nnot be noticed in the crowd of civilian workers. Roger and Astro were\ncarrying tools over their shoulders and were lagging behind the main\nbody of workers moving toward a huge tunnel opening. Tom saw his chance\nand moved up quickly beside them.\n\n\"Keep walking and don't show surprise!\" he whispered sharply.\n\nBut it was too much to ask. Astro and Roger jumped in surprise and let\nout involuntary shouts of joy, which attracted the attention of the\nguards. They noticed the stranger in civilian clothes and stared at\nhim.\n\n\"Tom!\" exclaimed Roger. \"What the devil are you--?\"\n\n\"Sh!\" hissed Tom. \"We haven't got much time.\" He saw one of the guards\nturn and stare at him. \"Listen to me,\" he continued quickly. \"I've got\nimportant dope about the saboteur!\"\n\n\"How?\" gasped Astro.\n\n\"Never mind,\" replied Tom. \"Now, to nail him, I've got to get him into\nthe act! I need proof!\"\n\n\"But who is it?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"I can't tell you now. Here comes the guard. Are you going to be working\naround here long?\"\n\n\"At least another three days,\" said Roger. \"But who--?\"\n\nRoger noticed the guard move up to them and he suddenly straightened up\nand snorted derisively, \"Yeah. But why a guy should want to join the\nSolar Guard is more than I can see. You must be wacky, mister!\"\n\nHe and Astro walked away, and after a hesitant look at Tom, the guard\nfollowed the two cadets. Tom boarded the slidewalk heading back toward\nthe Academy. So far, so good. He knew where his unit mates were, but up\nahead, in the gleaming Tower of Galileo, was his second target, Captain\nStrong. His skipper had to listen to him, had to be sympathetic and help\nhim catch the saboteur. It was the only way Tom could clear his own name\nand free Roger and Astro.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\n\"Scott!\"\n\n\"Here!\" bellowed a grizzled spaceman in reply to Major Connel's call.\n\n\"Augutino!\"\n\n\"Here!\"\n\n\"Jones!\n\n\"Present!\"\n\n\"Smith!\"\n\n\"Here!\"\n\n\"Albert!\"\n\n\"Here!\"\n\nConnel checked the last name on the clipboard and turned to Professor\nHemmingwell standing beside him at the base of the ship. \"All present\nand ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said the professor. He turned and looked around. \"Where is\nDave?\"\n\n\"Here he comes now,\" said Connel.\n\nThey both watched Barret stride toward them, his arms loaded with gear.\n\n\"This is the stuff I told you about, Professor,\" he said as Hemmingwell\nlooked at it curiously.\n\n\"What stuff?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Portable heaters for the crew's space suits, just in case--\" Barret\npaused meaningfully.\n\n\"In case of what?\" growled Connel.\n\n\"Why, ask them!\" replied Barret, gesturing toward the group of civilian\ncrewmen who had been selected for the test flight of the spaceship.\n\nConnel turned to look at them, then back at Barret. \"Ask them what?\" he\nbarked.\n\n\"How they feel about making this flight,\" said Barret.\n\nConnel scowled and turned to the men. \"Is there anything to what he\nsays?\" he demanded.\n\nThe men shuffled their feet nervously but did not reply.\n\n\"Well?\" exploded Connel.\n\n\"See, they're afraid of you, Connel,\" said Barret, deliberately omitting\nthe courtesy of using the major's title.\n\nIgnoring Barret's thrust, Connel continued to face the men. \"Is that\nright, men?\" he shouted. \"Are you afraid of me?\"\n\nThere was a mumble from the group and then the man named Scott, a\nthick-set individual with black flashing eyes, stepped forward.\n\n\"Speaking for myself,\" he said, looking straight at the major, \"I'm not\nafraid of anything that walks. And that includes you, Major Connel. No\noffense meant, it's just a statement of fact.\" He paused and drew a deep\nbreath. Then he added, \"But I am afraid of this ship.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Connel, who could not help admiring the man for his\nstraightforward approach.\n\n\"She's junk-jinxed,\" said the man, using the expression of spacemen who\nbelieved a ship with a suspicious accident record should be junked\nbecause it was jinxed.\n\n\"Junk-jinxed!\" cried Connel, amazed.\n\n\"Preposterous,\" snorted Professor Hemmingwell. \"Why, you helped build\nthis ship, Scotty! Do you doubt the work you've put into her? Or the\nwork of your friends?\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it,\" replied Scott stubbornly. \"The others\nfeel the same way I do.\"\n\nBarret stepped forward. Arrogantly and before Connel could stop him, he\nbegan addressing the men. \"Listen, you men!\" he shouted. \"You're being\nchildish! Why, you built this ship! How can you possibly allow\nyourselves to be so stupid as to believe in an idiotic thing like a\njinx. Now, why don't you just get aboard and stop being so ridiculously\nsuperstitious!\"\n\nConnel could have reached out with one of his big hands and squeezed\nBarret's neck to shut him up. Instead of allaying their fears, which\neven he would admit were real enough, the man was creating further\nresentment with his attack on their pride as thinking, reasoning men.\n\n\"All right, all right!\" he bellowed. \"That's enough for now, _Mister_\nBarret!\" He turned to the men and he could tell by the expressions on\ntheir faces that he had lost them. They would not take the ship aloft.\nBut he had to try.\n\n\"Now listen,\" he growled. \"This is a very important project and someone\nhas been trying to get us to wash out the whole idea. If you don't come\nthrough, he'll succeed. You are the best men in your fields, and if\neach of you attend to your particular job, then the ship will blast off\nand be a success! Now, how about it?\"\n\nHe was met with the stony faces of men who were afraid. Nothing he could\nsay or offer them would get them to take the ship off the ground. He\ntried a new tack. \"I'm offering you _double wages_!\" he roared.\n\nThe men were silent.\n\n\"Double wages _and_ a bonus!\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"All right! Beat it!\" he growled. \"Don't ever show your faces around\nhere again!\"\n\nConnel turned to Professor Hemmingwell. \"I'll see if I can't muster a\ncrew from the ranks of the Solar Guard,\" he said.\n\n\"Major,\" said the professor, his face worn and haggard from the long\nordeal of completing the project, \"I wouldn't want men _ordered_ to man\nthis vessel.\"\n\n\"They're in the Solar Guard and they take orders,\" said Connel.\n\n\"No,\" persisted Hemmingwell. \"I will not let a man on that ship that\ndoes not want to go. Remember, Major, it is still my personal property.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Connel grimly. \"I'll see if I can recruit a crew from\nthe civilian workers around the Academy.\"\n\nBut Major Connel encountered the same superstitious dread everywhere.\nThe word had spread that the projectile ship was jinxed. Old tales of\nother ships that had gone out into space, never to be heard of again,\nwere recalled, and the men found instances of similar prelaunching\nhappenings on the projectile ship. Very little of it was true, of\ncourse. The stories were half-truths and legends that had been handed\ndown through generations of spacemen, but they seemed to have special\nsignificance now.\n\nConnel fumed and ranted, threatened and cajoled, begged and pleaded, but\nit was no use. There was not a man in the Academy who would set foot\ninside the \"jinxed\" ship. Finally, in a last desperate attempt, he\nignored Hemmingwell's order and appealed to Commander Walters.\n\n\"No, Lou. I cannot order men to take that ship up,\" Commander Walters\nreplied, \"and you know it!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" argued Connel. \"You're the commander, aren't you?\"\n\n\"I most certainly am,\" asserted Walters, \"and if I want to get other\nthings done in the Solar Guard, I can't order men to take a jinxed ship\noff the ground.\" He looked at Connel narrowly. \"Do you remember the old\nfreighter, the _Spaceglow_?\" he asked.\n\nConnel frowned but didn't reply.\n\n\"You were mate on that ship before you enlisted in the Solar Guard,\"\npersisted Walters. \"And I read the log of your first trip when you\nwrote, and I quote, 'There seems to be some mysterious and unanswerable\ncondition aboard this vessel that makes her behave as if she had human\nintelligence....'\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with _this_ situation!\" roared Connel.\n\n\"They're alike! You couldn't get a crew on that wagon in any port of\ncall from Venus to Jupiter!\"\n\n\"But we found out what was wrong with her eventually!\"\n\n\"Yes, but the legend still exists that the _Spaceglow_ had intelligence\nof its own!\" asserted Walters.\n\n\"All right,\" snorted Connel. \"So we have to fight superstition! But,\nblast it, Commander, we're faced with a saboteur. There's nothing\nsupernatural or mysterious about a man with a bomb!\"\n\nConnel turned abruptly and walked out of the commander's office, more\nfurious than Walters had ever seen him.\n\nBack at the hangar, Connel faced the professor. It was a tough thing to\ntell the elderly man, and Connel, for all his hard exterior, could\neasily appreciate the professor's feelings. After many years of struggle\nto convince die-hard bankers of the soundness of his Space Projectile\nplan, followed by sabotage and costly work stoppages, it was\nheart-rending to have a \"jinx\" finally stop him.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Connel, \"but that's the way things are, Professor.\"\n\n\"I understand, Major,\" replied Hemmingwell wearily. He turned away,\nshoulders slumping, and walked back to his tiny office in the shadow of\nthe mighty ship that was anchored on the ground.\n\n\"May I speak to you a moment, Major?\" a voice broke the silence in the\nhangar.\n\nConnel turned around slowly. \"You!\" he exclaimed. \"If it hadn't been for\nyou and your big mouth, this ship might be in space right now!\"\n\n\"Stop blowing your jets!\" snapped Dave Barret. \"I want to see this ship\nin space as badly as you do. Perhaps even more so. But listen, I'm not\nafraid of the jinx. Neither are you, nor is Professor Hemmingwell. We're\nspacemen. And we know the operation of every piece of equipment on that\nship. What's to prevent us from taking her up?\"\n\nConnel looked at the young man, immediately recognizing the value of his\nsuggestion. He nodded his head curtly. \"All right,\" he said. \"I'll take\nyou up on that.\"\n\nBarret grinned, stuck out his hand, and after a friendly shake turned\nand ran to the professor's office. Connel walked back to the outside of\nthe hangar and began bellowing orders for the giant ship to be brought\nout to the blast ramp and prepared for the blast-off.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut Dave Barret did not go directly to Professor Hemmingwell's office.\nHe made one stop. Looking around quickly to make sure that he was not\nobserved, he slipped into the teleceiver booth and made a hurried call\nto an Atom City number. When a gruff voice answered, he merely said\nthree words:\n\n\"It's all set!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRoger and Astro were some distance away from the main gang, working at\nthe tunnel mouth overlooking the hangar area.\n\n\"Look, Astro,\" said Roger. \"They're bringing out the ship. They must be\nready to blast off!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAstro stopped his work momentarily and stared as the huge ship was\ninched out of the hangar, resting on her tail fins, her nose pointing\nskyward.\n\n\"I'd sure like to be bucking the power deck on that baby,\" sighed Astro.\n\n\"Yeah, and I'd give my eyeteeth to see that radar deck,\" said Roger. \"It\nmust be really something with all the gear to control those projectiles\nwhen they're released.\"\n\n\"Do you believe any of that talk about her being jinxed?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Stop being a Venusian lunkhead!\" snorted Roger. \"The only thing wrong\nwith that ship is a rocket-blasting clever saboteur.\"\n\n\"You know,\" said Astro, \"I've been thinking.\"\n\n\"Don't strain yourself,\" snorted Roger. But when Astro failed to reply\nin kind, the blond-haired cadet realized he was serious. \"What is it?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Why, in the name of the moons of Mars, would Barret want to do the\nthings he did to us?\"\n\n\"Simple,\" said Roger, beginning to sweep industriously as he saw the\nguard walking toward them. \"He didn't like the way we manhandled him.\"\n\n\"You think he was just getting even with us?\" asked Astro, also resuming\nwork.\n\n\"What else?\" asked Roger. \"We made him look pretty silly. And that was\nno love tap I gave him that night we caught him in the hangar.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean,\" said Astro. \"I know Major Connel said he was\nsupposed to be there. But with that teleceiver conversation I overheard\nand all the rest--well, I just don't get it,\" he concluded lamely.\n\n\"You'll get it in the neck if you don't watch out,\" said Roger. \"Here\ncomes Spike and he doesn't like to see us loafing!\"\n\nThe two cadets worked steadily for ten minutes, and when the guard\nfinally walked away, they paused to watch the big ship again.\n\n\"I wonder what Tom is up to?\" said Roger thoughtfully. \"He said he knew\nwho the saboteur was, but he needed help to prove it.\"\n\n\"I'd give a full year's leave just to get my hands on that guy for ten\nminutes,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Yeah,\" grunted Roger. \"Well, come on, hot-shot, we still got a lot of\ncleaning to do.\"\n\nThey returned to their work, but even then, as they watched the\npreparations for the take-off of the big ship, they both thought about\nTom. They knew his problems were as difficult as their own, and with\nmuch more at stake. If Tom failed in his efforts to catch the saboteur,\nit could very well mean the end of the _Polaris_ unit.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\n\"_Bump-ty--bump-ty--bump-ty--_\"\n\nTom Corbett's heart beat with such rapid, heavy drumming that the young\ncadet felt as though it was going to tear itself right out of his chest.\n\nFor nearly six hours Tom had lain in wait in Galaxy Hall, the museum of\nSpace Academy, on the second floor of the Tower building. He was hiding\nin the tail section of the _Space Queen_, the first rocket ship to\nbreach space safely, blasting from Earth to Luna and back again. He had\nkept watch through a crack in the hull of the old ship, waiting for the\nlights to go out, a signal that the Academy had bedded down for the\nnight.\n\nNow, in the silence of the museum, surrounded by the ancient objects\nthat traced man's progress to the stars, Tom felt like crying. For as\nlong as he had been at the Academy, he had revered these crude, frail\nobjects and wondered if he would ever match the bravery of the men who\nused them. Now, unless his plan was successful, he would be finished as\na cadet and the dream of being an officer in the Solar Guard would\nvanish forever.\n\nThe Tower building had been quiet for over an hour. Tom had not heard\nany voices or movement other than the evenly paced steps of the guards\npatrolling their lonely beats outside.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe slipped out of the antiquated ship, and staying well in the shadows,\nmoved out into the corridor to the head of the slidestairs. He peered\nover the railing to the main floor below and saw Warrant Officer Mike\nMcKenny through the open door of a small office, seated at his desk,\nwatching an evening stereo program. The young cadet jumped on the stairs\nquickly and rode the moving belt of plastic to the upper floors where\nthe officers' quarters were located.\n\nTom was in great danger of discovery. No civilian was allowed on Academy\ngrounds after taps. And he was still wearing the civilian clothes he had\ntaken from the suitcase on the passenger ship from Mars. Silently but\nswiftly, he made his way from level to level toward the seventy-fifth\nfloor.\n\nHe knew that there would be a guard stationed in the halls outside the\nofficers' apartments and it would be impossible to elude him. He would\nsimply have to brazen it out.\n\nAt the seventy-fifth floor the young cadet stepped off the slidestairs\nnoisily, his heels clicking on the dark crystal floor, and strode down\nthe hall. He was immediately seen by the guard who advanced to meet him,\nhis ray gun at the ready. Tom was prepared.\n\n\"Guard!\" he yelled.\n\nThe guard stopped in front of him, a puzzled look on his face. \"Yes?\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"Sir!\" snapped Tom. \"Show me where Captain Strong's quarters are and be\nquick about it!\"\n\n\"But who are--?\" The guard started to protest, but Tom did not give him\nthe chance to finish.\n\n\"Don't stand there like an idiot, man! _Move!_\"\n\n\"Uhh--yes, sir,\" stammered the guard, obviously taken aback.\n\n\"Lead the way,\" continued Tom loudly. \"I haven't much time.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but would you mind lowering your voice, sir? Some of the\nofficers are asleep, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, get on then and stop jabbering!\"\n\nThe guard turned quickly and started down the hall. Tom followed,\nhardly able to keep from smiling at the man's frustration and confusion.\n\nThey stopped at the door to Captain Strong's quarters and the guard\nrapped softly.\n\n\"Yes?\" came a muffled voice from inside.\n\n\"Someone to see you, sir,\" called the guard.\n\n\"Just a moment.\"\n\nThe guard stepped to one side and stood at rigid attention. When the\ndoor opened and Captain Strong was revealed, Tom brushed past the guard\nand stepped into the room, talking quickly.\n\n\"My name is Hinkleworth, Captain,\" he announced. \"I am here at the\nrequest of Commissioner Jessup to discuss the installation of new radar\nequipment on all Solar Guard rocket cruisers!\"\n\nTom slammed the door closed behind him and turned to face the astonished\nSolar Guard officer.\n\n\"What in the star-blazing--?\" Strong began angrily.\n\n\"It's me, Captain Strong!\" Tom said quickly, pulling his hat off and\nlowering his collar.\n\n\"Corbett!\" gasped Strong, taking an involuntary step back, his face\nmirroring his disbelief.\n\n\"Sh!\" whispered the boy, motioning to the door. Recovering his\ncomposure, Strong swept past him, opened the door, and found the guard\nstill standing there at attention.\n\n\"All right, Corporal,\" said Strong. \"Resume your station.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the guard and walked down the hall. Strong watched\nhim for a moment, then turned back into his room, closing and locking\nthe door behind him. He faced the young cadet, who grinned back at him\nweakly.\n\n\"All right, spaceboy,\" said Strong, flopping in the nearest chair.\n\"Start at the beginning and give it to me. _All of it!_\"\n\nTom began his story with the incident of the runaway truck at Marsport,\ntold of his abduction and escape from the two truckers, Cag and Monty,\nhis efforts to reach Space Academy, and finally revealed the identity of\nthe man he thought was responsible for the whole effort to stop the\nprojectile operation.\n\nAt this, Strong jumped to his feet. \"That's the most fantastic thing\nI've ever heard, Corbett!\" he snapped. \"What kind of proof do you have?\"\n\n\"None, sir,\" replied Tom. \"The only reason I came here tonight is to ask\nyou to help me get that proof.\"\n\nWhen Strong was silent, shaking his head, Tom tried again.\n\n\"Sir, you do believe me, don't you?\" asked the boy with a sinking\nfeeling in his heart. \"What about all the things that have happened to\nme and to Roger and Astro?\"\n\n\"I can explain them away just as easily as you can explain your theory,\"\nreplied Strong. He walked over and patted the cadet on the shoulder\nsympathetically. \"I'm sorry, Tom,\" he said gently. \"Your story is just\ntoo fantastic and you haven't even the slightest shred of evidence. Just\na few words an unreliable witness said under duress.\"\n\n\"I realize that, sir,\" replied the cadet. \"But don't you see? This is\nthe only way to clear my name.\"\n\nStrong turned to the window, looked out thoughtfully for a moment, and\nthen turned back to the boy. \"How do you think I can help you?\" he said,\na more sympathetic note in his voice.\n\nHis eyes bright with hope again, Tom spoke quickly and eagerly. The\nSolar Guard captain calmly packed his pipe and lighted it, stopping the\nboy now and then to ask a question. Finally, when Tom was finished,\nStrong nodded and silently puffed at his pipe.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" asked Tom eagerly.\n\n\"I don't know, Tom,\" replied Strong. \"It's a pretty wild idea. And it\nleaves me way out on a limb.\"\n\n\"Only if we fail, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Which is more than likely,\" Strong commented dryly.\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" said Tom, \"if you really don't think it can work, then\nI suggest that you call the guard and turn me in. I've put you in enough\ntrouble already.\" Tom moved to the door.\n\n\"Stop playing the hero, Corbett,\" said Strong. \"I didn't say I wouldn't\nhelp you. But we have to think this thing out.\"\n\nTom sat down, eying Strong hopefully.\n\n\"Now, let me get this straight,\" said Strong. \"First you want me to help\nAstro and Roger escape from the work gang. All right, that may work\neasily enough. But why?\"\n\n\"So we can get aboard the projectile ship and go through her tests with\nher.\"\n\n\"I suppose you've heard that Connel, Professor Hemmingwell, and Dave\nBarret are going to take her up.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Tom replied, grinning. \"That's why I want to go along. To\nmake sure no more accidents happen.\"\n\n\"I could send a squad of Space Marines for that kind of job,\" mused\nStrong.\n\n\"But that would alert Barret,\" protested Tom. \"He might not try\nanything. If he doesn't suspect he's being watched, we may be able to\ncatch him in the act. And he certainly wouldn't think the three of us\nare aboard.\"\n\n\"Hum. Maybe you're right,\" nodded Strong. \"Then after I get you three on\nthe ship, I'm supposed to spend my time trailing your prize suspect,\nright?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" nodded the young cadet.\n\n\"I'll have to give it consideration, Tom,\" said Strong after a momentary\npause. \"As much as I admire your plan and as much as I want to help you,\nthis places me in a highly untenable position. Have you stopped to think\nwhat would happen to me if it were ever known that I had sheltered you\nhere in my quarters and aided in the escape of two convicted cadets from\nthe work gang?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom soberly. \"And--all I can say is I'll do whatever\nyou think is best.\"\n\n\"Well, get some sleep now,\" sighed Strong. \"I've got to make a tour of\nthe guard.\"\n\nWithout another word, Tom went into Captain Strong's bedroom and fell\nasleep thirty seconds after his head hit the pillow. His last waking\nthought was that if his plan had any merit Captain Strong would help\nhim.\n\nSteve Strong did not leave his quarters immediately. He sat in the easy\nchair and puffed thoughtfully on his pipe until there was nothing left\nin the burnt and charred bowl. Then he rose and left the room to make\nhis rounds. He walked slowly through the hollow, empty hallways of the\nTower building, riding up and down the slidestairs, speaking curtly to\nthe guards, and finally walked out on the wide steps facing the grassy\nquadrangle.\n\nStrong glanced up at the sky. He counted the stars he could see and he\nremembered that as a boy of eight he knew the names and positions of\nevery one. He recalled his entrance to the Academy as a cadet and how\nhis unit instructor had guided him and taught him the many things a\nspaceman must know. He thought of his long tour as a line officer in the\nSolar Guard fleet under Commander Walters, then a major, and he\nremembered his brother officers, many of whom were now dead. There was\none thing they all had in common, one thing that overshadowed all\npersonal differences. One thing that was almost like a religion.\nComradeship. A feeling of belonging, a knowledge that there was _always_\nsomeone who would believe in you and your ideas.\n\nOne thing. Friendship.\n\nCaptain Strong spun on his heel, walked back into the Tower, and rode\nthe slidestairs back to his quarters. He had made up his mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n\"_Stand by to raise ship!_\"\n\nConnel's bull-throated roar blasted through the intercom of the gleaming\nprojectile ship from the power deck where Dave Barret was stationed, up\nto the radar bridge where Professor Hemmingwell waited anxiously.\n\nOn the main deck, seated at the controls, Connel spoke rapidly into the\naudioceiver microphone. \"Projectile vessel to spaceport traffic\ncontrol,\" he called. \"Request blast-off clearance!\"\n\n\"Spaceport traffic control to Connel,\" came a voice in reply over the\naudioceiver. \"You are cleared. Your time is two minutes to zero!\"\n\nConnel began snapping the many levers and switches on the control panel\nin proper sequence, keeping a wary eye on the astral chronometer over\nhis head as one of its red hands ticked off the seconds to blast-off.\n\nThe teleceiver screen to his right showed a view of the stern of the\nvessel and Connel could see some of the ground crew slowly rolling away\nthe boarding equipment. Flipping on the switch that opened a circuit to\nan outside loud-speaker, he bellowed an order for the area to be\ncleared. The crew scurried back behind the blast deflectors and watched\nthe ship through the thick crystal viewports.\n\n\"Power deck,\" Connel called into the intercom, \"check in!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye!\" reported Barret.\n\n\"Radar deck, check in!\"\n\n\"Radar deck, aye!\" Professor Hemmingwell acknowledged in a thin voice.\n\n\"Feed reactant!\" Connel ordered.\n\n\"Reactant feeding at D-9 rate,\" said Barret after a split-second pause.\n\n\"Energize cooling pumps!\"\n\n\"Cooling pumps, aye!\"\n\n\"Cut in take-off gyros!\"\n\n\"Gyros on,\" repeated Barret.\n\n\"All clear forward and up!\" replied the elderly man.\n\n\"Right!\" bawled Major Connel. \"Stand by!\"\n\nTensely he watched the red hand crawl up the face of the chronometer and\nhe gripped the intercom microphone tightly. \"Blast off,\" he began,\n\"minus five, four, three, two, one, _zero_!\"\n\nConnel slammed home the master control switch and in an instant the\nsilver ship trembled under a tremendous surge of power. Flame and smoke\npoured out of its exhaust and slowly it began to reach for sky,\nstraining as if to break invisible bonds holding it to Earth. Her jets\nshrieking torturously, the ship picked up speed and then suddenly,\nas though shot from a cannon, it blasted up through the\natmosphere--spacebound.\n\nA moment later, on the control deck of the ship, Major Connel swung\nforward in his chair, shook off the effects of the tremendous\nacceleration, and called into the intercom, \"Switch on the gravity\ngenerators!\"\n\nAs soon as the artificial gravity was in effect, the officer put the\nship on standard cruising speed, changed course slightly to put them on\na direct heading to Mars, and then ordered Barret and Hemmingwell to the\ncontrol deck.\n\n\"Well, Professor,\" he said as he gave the old man a hearty handshake,\n\"so far so good. She handles like a baby carriage. If the projectiles\nwork half as well, you'll really have yourself something!\"\n\nProfessor Hemmingwell smiled appreciatively and turned to Barret, who\nwas just climbing through the hatch from the power deck. \"You've done as\nmuch as anyone to help this ship get into space, Dave,\" he said. \"Thank\nyou!\"\n\n\"Think nothing of it, Professor,\" replied Barret airily.\n\n\"Well, shall we begin the first series of tests?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"By all means!\" said the professor enthusiastically. \"If you and Dave\nwill check the firing stations, I'll take care of the paper work!\"\n\n\"Right,\" replied Connel. \"Let's go, Barret!\"\n\n\"I'll work outside, Major,\" said Barret, turning toward the air lock.\n\"You see that all the firing chambers are properly loaded.\"\n\n\"Anything you say, Barret.\"\n\nThe two men turned away from the smiling professor and left the control\ndeck. They separated in the companionway, Connel hurrying to the\nstarboard firing chambers and Barret going to the midships air lock\nwhere he put on a space suit for his task out on the hull.\n\nIn two minutes the young scientist was out on the odd-looking blisters\nthat marked the exterior of the firing chambers ringing the hull.\n\nAt each blister Barret examined the hollow firing tube carefully. In\nseveral he made delicate adjustments to a small metallic ring extending\nfrom the opening of the tube. The ring was one of the most important\nparts of the firing unit, emitting the long-range electronic beam\ncontrolling the flight of the projectile.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the ship, Connel checked the loading of each of the\nchambers, making certain that each of the ten-foot-long torpedolike\nprojectiles was properly secured in its blasting cradle. After fifteen\nminutes and a complete trip around the ship, the major was satisfied\nthat all was in readiness. He returned to the control deck, meeting\nBarret on the way, and they found Professor Hemmingwell just completing\nhis calculations for the initial test. He turned to them, waving a paper\nin front of their eyes.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said proudly, \"we are almost ready. If you will adjust\ncourse fifteen degrees to port, we'll be in proper position for the\ntest!\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Connel. \"Stand by below, Barret.\"\n\n\"On my way,\" replied Barret, disappearing through the hatch.\n\n\"Well, Professor,\" said Connel, walking to the controls, \"this is the\nbig moment!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Hemmingwell. \"If these rocket projectiles prove workable\nnow, there's nothing to stop us from carrying on with our test of the\nground receivers on Mars immediately.\"\n\n\"Power deck to control deck, check in!\" Barret's voice suddenly crackled\nover the intercom.\n\n\"Control deck, aye,\" replied Connel. \"Ready to blast?\"\n\n\"All set!\"\n\n\"Give me a ten-second burst on the starboard steering rockets,\" ordered\nConnel, gripping the steering vane control tightly.\n\n\"Coming up!\"\n\nThere was a sudden, jolting blast from the stern and Connel and\nHemmingwell hung on grimly as the mighty ship turned in space. Watching\nthe control panel instruments carefully, Connel slammed home the switch\nthat opened the powerful nose braking rockets and brought the ship to a\ndead stop in space.\n\n\"On course, Professor, ready to fire!\" Connel announced triumphantly,\nand Hemmingwell took his station before the giant projectile control\nboard.\n\n\"Stand by to fire one!\" said the professor, making a minute adjustment\non the panel. Behind him, Connel unconsciously crossed his fingers.\n\n\"Fire one!\" shouted Hemmingwell.\n\nConnel pressed a red button on the panel and waited, holding his breath.\nThere was a distinct hissing and then the great ship lurched slightly.\nOn the teleceiver overhead a white flash appeared, streaked across the\nscreen, and then disappeared in the darkness of space.\n\n\"Fire two!\"\n\nAgain there was a hissing sound and another white burst of light faded\ninto the millions of other pinpoints of lights in the black void.\n\nOver and over again, at one-minute intervals, the projectiles were\nfired, until all twelve of the firing chambers had discharged their\nfire-tailed missiles.\n\nThe professor sat back and smiled weakly at Connel. The gruff major\nwinked encouragingly and they both turned to watch the teleceiver screen\nanxiously. The gyros on each projectile had been preset for a circular\nflight of fifteen minutes' duration. Soon they would be returning and\nthe delicate job of bringing them safely aboard would begin.\n\n\"Here comes number one,\" shouted Connel, as a small pinpoint of light\nappeared on the screen.\n\n\"I'm ready!\" said the professor. He watched the teleceiver screen\ncarefully, made a minute adjustment of the dial controlling the\ndirectional beam emitted by the ring in the number-one firing chamber,\nand at the last possible moment, snapped the remote-control switch that\ncut the power in the approaching test projectile. It hung dead in space,\nimmediately over the chamber. Gently the professor increased the power\nof the electro-magnetic ring and pulled the projectile back into the\nchamber as easily as slipping a hand in a glove.\n\n\"Success!\" Connel shouted. \"Professor, you've done it!\"\n\n\"Congratulations, sir,\" Dave Barret called over the intercom from the\npower deck.\n\n\"Here comes number two,\" said Professor Hemmingwell excitedly, and began\nto repeat the process to draw the approaching projectiles back into the\nship.\n\nOne after another, five projectiles were taken aboard successfully.\nThen, as he worked on the sixth, the professor began to frown. He\nrechecked his instruments and then shook his head, obviously disturbed.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" growled Connel, noticing Hemmingwell's growing\nnervousness.\n\n\"The homing ring on number six tube isn't working properly,\" replied\nHemmingwell. \"I can't control the projectile.\"\n\n\"Any idea what's wrong?\" the Solar Guard officer asked.\n\n\"The settings on the ring must be wrong.\" The professor picked up the\nintercom mike. \"Dave,\" he called, \"check in!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" replied Barret immediately.\n\n\"Did you check the settings on all the rings in the firing chambers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" reported Barret. \"They looked O.K. to me. Why don't you\ncheck with Connel? He supervised their installation.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said the major. \"I'll go outside and look them over.\"\n\nConnel turned on his heel and hurried to the air-lock chamber. Moving\nwith amazing speed for a big man, he donned the space suit in the\nchamber while the pressure was being equalized. As soon as the air-lock\nportal opened, he scrambled out on the hull and made his way forward to\nthe bulging firing chambers. Stooping over the empty tube of number six,\nhe examined the ring carefully and began to frown. Moving on to number\nseven, his frown deepened. By the time he checked the rings of eight and\nnine, his face was a grim mask of anger.\n\n\"Professor,\" he called into his helmet microphone, \"check in.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yes, Major,\" replied Hemmingwell from the control deck. \"Have you found\nthe trouble?\"\n\n\"I sure have,\" Connel growled. \"It's sabotage! And now I think I know\nwho--\"\n\nConnel never finished. There was a sudden burst of power from the great\nship and the officer was hurled into space.\n\n\"Major!\" cried Hemmingwell. \"Barret! What have you done? Connel is\noutside!\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it, Professor,\" replied Barret from the power deck. \"My\nhand slipped and--\"\n\n\"Don't talk!\" shouted Hemmingwell. \"Stop the ship!\"\n\n\"I can't! The control is jammed!\"\n\nAs the ship surged through space and the professor and Barret yelled at\neach other over the intercom, three Space Cadets rose from their hiding\nplace in the hold of the ship.\n\nTom Corbett nudged Roger and Astro. \"You hear that?\" he said grimly.\n\n\"Yeah!\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Let's go!\" growled Astro.\n\nWithout another word, they opened the hatch and made their way quickly\nthrough the rocketing ship, each going to their separate stations,\naccording to the prearranged plan. Roger climbed up to the radar bridge,\nTom entered the control deck, and Astro burst into the power deck.\n\n\"You!\" Barret cried out, his eyes wide with sudden fear as the huge\nVenusian advanced on him menacingly.\n\n\"Get away from those controls,\" growled the big cadet. \"If you don't, so\nhelp me, I'll break you in two!\"\n\nBarret backed away, his face white, hands pawing the air frantically as\nif he were trying to push the big cadet back.\n\n\"Get over there,\" said Astro. \"Sit down and keep your mouth shut!\"\n\nOn the control deck, Tom was strapping himself into the pilot's chair\nand calling frantically into the intercom, \"Give me a course, Roger!\"\n\n\"One-seventy-degree turn to starboard,\" replied Roger, \"and full ahead!\nI've got the major on my scanner.\"\n\n\"Pour on the power, Astro!\" shouted Tom, gripping the controls firmly.\n\nAs the mighty ship blasted in a long, sweeping arc, Professor\nHemmingwell sat numbly in his chair, aware only that the three cadets\nwere taking the vessel back into the area where the remaining\nprojectiles, completely out of control, were buzzing around in space\nlike maddened hornets.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\n\"There he is!\"\n\nRoger's voice rose to a triumphant shout on the intercom. \"Put the\nbrakes on this wagon!\"\n\n\"Check!\" retorted Astro from the power deck, his fingers flying over the\nswitches of the control panel and bringing the ship to a sudden blasting\nstop.\n\nOn the control deck, Tom turned to Professor Hemmingwell. \"I'm going\noutside to get Major Connel, sir,\" he said. \"Do you think you'll be all\nright?\"\n\nThe old man nodded absently, still dazed by the sudden turn of events.\nTom hurried past him and met Roger coming down from the radar bridge.\n\"I'm going too!\" the blond-haired cadet announced.\n\n\"You tell Astro?\"\n\n\"Yeah. He's got Barret locked in the power-deck storeroom and he'll take\nover the control deck. Wonder if they have a jet boat aboard?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. Not on a test flight.\"\n\n\"We'll have to hurry,\" said Roger as they reached the air lock and began\nto scramble into space suits.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Tom. \"He probably doesn't have much oxygen.\"\n\n\"There's another reason,\" grunted Roger.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Those projectiles. We're right back in the middle of them. Any one of\nthem could wreck the ship.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" said Tom. \"Guess it's up to Astro to keep dodging\nthem.\"\n\n\"Never thought I'd be out in space ducking hot projectiles to save old\nBlast-off Connel's hide.\"\n\n\"Neither did I,\" said Tom. \"But here we are.\"\n\nStepping into the air lock, they quickly equalized the pressure and a\nmoment later climbed out on the hull.\n\n\"See him, Roger?\" asked Tom over the helmet intercom.\n\n\"Not yet,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"I see him,\" called Astro from the control deck. \"I got him spotted on\nthe teleceiver. Go aft, about a thousand, maybe fifteen hundred yards.\nI'll direct you from there.\"\n\n\"Right!\" snapped Roger. \"And listen, you Venusian bonehead! Make it\ngood. I don't like being a clay pigeon for this crazy shooting gallery\nout here!\"\n\n\"Aw, damp your tubes and get to work,\" drawled Astro. \"Honestly, Tom,\ndid you ever hear him _not_ complain?\"\n\nTom did not answer. He was busy fastening two oxygen tanks to the front\nof his space suit and Roger's. When he had finished, he checked the\npressure and, satisfied, nodded to his unit mate.\n\nOpening the nozzles of the bottles, they shot away from the ship into\nthe nothingness of space.\n\n\"You have to go about fifteen degrees to your starboard and five degrees\nup on the ecliptic,\" called Astro from the control deck. \"You'll hit\nConnel right on the nose!\"\n\n\"Right!\" replied Tom, turning the nozzle of the oxygen bottle to the\nleft and immediately shooting off in the indicated direction. Roger\nfollowed quickly and expertly.\n\n\"See him?\" called Tom.\n\n\"No,\" replied Roger. \"Are you sure, you big clunk?\"\n\n\"He's right above you!\" snorted Astro over the intercom. Then his voice\nrose in alarm. \"No! That isn't--\"\n\n\"Duck, Tom!\" cried Roger.\n\nTom opened the nozzle of his oxygen bottle wide and turned it. As he\nshot away, a projectile roared through the area he had just left.\n\nRoger had done the same thing, flipping over and shooting up and away\nfrom the moving object.\n\n\"Whew!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That was close!\"\n\n\"You blockhead!\" roared Roger. \"What are you trying to do to us? Set us\nup for coffins?\"\n\n\"For you, that's not a bad idea, Manning!\" snorted Astro. \"Just damp\nyour tubes. I made a mistake.\"\n\n\"Some mistake!\" growled Roger.\n\nTom and Roger maneuvered back together, and locking arms so they would\nnot drift apart, scanned the void around them for Connel. Suddenly Tom\njerked free. \"Roger!\" he cried.\n\n\"What is it?\" replied the cadet. \"Do you see him?\"\n\n\"There!\" Tom pointed back to the ship. \"On the stern! He's hanging on to\nthe cleat over the main tubes!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_He's hanging on to the cleat over the main tube!_\"]\n\n\"Astro,\" Roger called, \"we're coming back in. We've spotted him.\"\n\n\"I heard you!\" said Astro. \"Must've come back on his own steam. Go get\nhim, quick!\"\n\nTurning the nozzles of their oxygen tanks, the two cadets shot toward\nthe ship. They quickly clambered onto the stern where Connel lay\nstretched out on the side of the hull, arms extended, his gloved hands\ngripping the small cleat on the side of the hull.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, the two boys had the Solar Guard officer safely\ninside the air-lock chamber and had removed his space helmet and suit.\nHis eyes were closed, and his face was deathly white. Tom immediately\nclapped an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose, while Roger applied\nheating units to the wrists and neck.\n\nAstro burst into the chamber, followed by the professor. \"Will he be all\nright?\" Hemmingwell asked anxiously.\n\n\"Think nothing of it, Professor Hummingbird,\" said Roger. \"The old major\nwill come around any second, and when he does, stand back. The first\nthing he'll do is yell.\"\n\n\"Roger, the name is Hemmingwell,\" hissed Tom.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, sure,\" nodded Roger, and then turned to Astro. \"Is Barret\nstill locked up?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" replied the Venusian. \"And I hid the key, so Connel can't get to\nhim until he cools off.\"\n\n\"The major is coming around,\" said Tom.\n\nAs they watched, Connel stirred, coughed several times, and then opened\nhis eyes. He stared in amazement at Tom, then turned to blink\nunbelievingly at Roger and Astro. \"What in the star-blazing--?\"\n\n\"It's us all right, sir!\" Tom assured him.\n\n\"Yeah,\" chimed in Roger. \"And you're not in heaven or--er--any place\nelse either.\"\n\nAs Connel suddenly flushed with anger and sat up, Hemmingwell spoke\nquickly. \"They saved your life, Major,\" he said.\n\n\"They did?\" Connel's face clouded in confusion. \"I don't understand. How\ndid you three get aboard, anyway?\"\n\n\"It's a long story, sir,\" said Tom. \"Right now, maybe we'd better--\"\n\nBefore the cadet could finish, there was a loud crashing and a series of\njolting bumps as the ship lurched.\n\n\"What the blue blazes!\" roared Connel, jumping to his feet in alarm.\n\n\"The projectiles!\" exclaimed Roger. \"We've got to get out of here!\"\n\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" cried Astro. \"I forgot all about them!\"\n\nTom, Roger, Astro, Hemmingwell, and Connel raced out of the air lock to\ntheir stations. Astro poured on the power without waiting for an order\nfrom the control deck and soon they were rocketing into the safety of\nspace.\n\nWatching the wildly flying missiles on the teleceiver screen, Connel\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Wow!\" he snorted. \"Glad we're out of that mess.\"\n\n\"But what are we going to do about them, sir,\" asked Tom, a worried\nfrown wrinkling his forehead as he watched the screen. \"We can't just\nleave those things there. Some other ship may--\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Connel broke in brusquely. \"The projectiles will\nrun out of fuel in a few minutes and they'll just drift. They can be\nfished out any time.\"\n\n\"We can go back and get them ourselves,\" said the young cadet eagerly.\n\"Roger and I can--\"\n\n\"We've got more important things to do now!\" thundered Connel. Switching\non the intercom, he ordered Roger and Astro to report to the control\ndeck. They appeared within seconds of his order and he faced the three\ncadets grimly.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" he asked, \"what's the story?\"\n\n\"I guess we'd better explain, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I guess you'd better,\" nodded Connel.\n\nTom quickly ran over the chain of events, beginning with his abduction\non Mars to their appearance on the ship, including the part Barret had\nplayed in tricking Roger and Astro into taking the scout. As he spoke,\nConnel looked more and more amazed, and when Tom finally uttered the\nname of the man he thought was responsible for all the sabotage, Connel\njumped out of his chair.\n\n\"I can't believe it!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You were nearly killed a few minutes ago, sir,\" said Tom. \"And who\nsabotaged the rings? Barret! Who was around every time something\nhappened? Who incited the crew to keep from taking this ship into space?\nWho spread the rumor that it was jinxed? The answer to every one of\nthose questions, sir, is Barret. And Dave Barret is working for--\"\n\n\"Let me at that sniveling space pup!\" interrupted Connel, snarling his\nrage. \"I'll tear him apart and throw him to the buzzards!\"\n\nThe enraged major jumped to the hatch but Astro and Tom barred his way,\nwith Roger stepping quickly in back of him, a heavy wrench in his hand,\nready to assist in any manner necessary to subdue the howling officer.\n\n\"Try to kill me!\" Connel howled. \"Why, I'll--I'll--\"\n\n\"No, Major!\" shouted Tom. \"He's the only one that can help us convict\nCarter Devers!\"\n\nConnel stopped. He stared at Astro's bulk and then turned to see Roger\ntrying to hide the wrench. \"Were you going to hit me with that thing,\nManning?\" he growled.\n\nRoger gulped. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"If it was necessary to keep you away\nfrom Barret, sir. I'm sorry, sir.\"\n\nConnel spun back to face Tom. \"Corbett, you must have a plan,\" he said.\n\"Let's have it quick.\"\n\nTom grinned. \"All right, sir,\" he began. Suddenly, out of the corner of\nhis eyes, he saw Professor Hemmingwell slump to the deck.\n\nHurriedly they picked up the old man and eased him gently to the nearby\nacceleration couch. After gulping some water that Roger poured for him,\nthe old man smiled weakly. \"I'm afraid I don't have the strength to\nwithstand all this excitement,\" he said. \"But now I understand why\nthings were never easy for me. Carter Devers--he did this to me. He\nblocked the proposals every time that they were submitted to the Solar\ndelegations. He--\" Hemmingwell's head fell back. Roger had put a\nsedative into the water and the old man was now unconscious.\n\n\"It's just fatigue,\" said Connel. \"He'll be all right in a little\nwhile.\" He turned to Tom. \"All right, Corbett, carry on!\"\n\nTom hurriedly concluded his story of the events leading up to their\nstartling appearance on the ship, and as he spoke, he saw the major's\nfrown change to a glowing grin. When Tom finished, Connel suddenly\nextended his hand in a gesture of friendship.\n\n\"I have to admit it, Corbett,\" he said. \"You've done a good job. And,\"\nhe added with a twinkle in his eye, \"by going along with you, I am an\naccomplice with Captain Strong in the aiding of three fugitives from the\nSolar Guard.\"\n\nTom, Astro, and Roger grinned. \"Now, let's get Barret up here and ask\nhim a few questions,\" continued Connel. \"And, Manning, if I can't\nrestrain myself, you have my permission to hit me with that wrench! But\nso help me, if you belt me before the time comes, I'll bend that wrench\nover your skull!\"\n\nWhile Astro and Roger went below to get Barret, Connel and Tom reviewed\ntheir plan.\n\n\"Better keep the news quiet for a while,\" said Connel. \"If we telecast\nit back to the Academy, Devers might get wise.\"\n\n\"Good idea, sir,\" acknowledged Tom.\n\n\"But I can't understand Devers' motive,\" said Connel. \"What does he\nstand to gain if this project is a failure?\"\n\n\"He'll lose plenty if it's a success,\" Tom asserted.\n\n\"Devers owns Jilolo Spaceways, the parent company of Universal Jet\nTrucking and Surface Transportation! If the projectiles worked, surface\ncargo delivery would be wiped out.\"\n\nBefore Connel could comment on Tom's startling revelation, they heard\nthe sound of angry voices just outside the control-deck hatch.\n\n\"That must be Astro and Roger bringing in Barret,\" said Tom with a grin.\n\nThe hatch clanked open and Astro appeared, carrying Roger under one arm\nand Barret under the other. He dropped them both unceremoniously on the\ndeck, but when they jumped to their feet, Roger charged forward quickly\nand landed a stinging right to Barret's jaw. The man dropped to the deck\nagain like a stone.\n\n\"Manning!\" roared Connel. \"What was the idea?\"\n\n\"I wanted to make sure I got in my licks before the Solar Guard got hold\nof him,\" replied Roger, rubbing his knuckles and looking down at\nBarret's inert form.\n\nAstro grinned sheepishly. \"I tried to stop him, sir!\" he said.\n\n\"I'll just bet you tried to stop him!\" bellowed Connel. \"Cadet Manning,\nyou put that man to sleep, now you wake him up!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Roger, and while Connel, Astro, and Tom roared with\nlaughter, he poured an entire bottle of water on Barret's face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about!\"\n\nShouting angrily, Barret sat in one of the pilot's chairs, flanked by\nRoger and Astro, while Connel and Tom stood in front of him firing\nquestions.\n\n\"Barret,\" said Connel, \"I have enough evidence on you now to send you to\na prison asteroid for ten years at least!\"\n\n\"On what charge?\" demanded the young man.\n\n\"Trying to kill an officer of the Solar Guard.\"\n\n\"Where is your proof?\" demanded Barret.\n\n\"Right there!\" snorted Major Connel, pointing to the sleeping figure of\nProfessor Hemmingwell.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Barret.\n\n\"He'll swear that you deliberately sent this ship into full drive while\nI was out on the hull checking the rings.\"\n\n\"He can't,\" protested Barret. \"He was on the bridge! He couldn't have\nseen a thing!\"\n\nTom shook his head gently. \"Barret, after what you've done to his ship\nand the projectile operation,\" he said, \"Hemmingwell will swear to\nanything.\"\n\n\"It's a frame-up!\" shouted Barret.\n\n\"And what do you think you did to us?\" snarled Roger.\n\nBarret flushed and turned away. \"You can't scare me,\" he muttered. \"Go\nahead. Let him swear to whatever he wants.\"\n\nConnel stepped back grimly and turned to Astro and Roger. \"All right,\nboys,\" he said. \"Take him below and see if you can't get some different\nanswers out of him.\" The hardened spaceman turned his back and walked to\nthe viewport.\n\n\"Why, you dirty space rat!\" screamed Barret. \"You wouldn't dare!\"\n\n\"Oh, wouldn't he!\" retorted Roger. \"Listen, pal, he figures we owe you\nplenty for what you did to us, and he's just giving us a chance to pay\nyou back!\" He faced Barret grimly. \"Mister, you're going to get the\nworks! Come on, Astro!\"\n\nAs the giant Venusian advanced on Barret, the man shrank back in his\nchair, eyes widening in sudden fear. When Astro stretched out his huge\nhand and grabbed him by the front of his jacket, he screamed in fright.\n\n\"All right, all right!\" he cried out. \"I'll talk! Devers did it! He made\nme do it! He's responsible for the whole thing!\"\n\n\"Turn on that audiograph, Corbett!\" shouted Connel.\n\nTom snapped on the machine and brought the microphone over to Barret,\nholding it in front of his trembling mouth.\n\n\"All right, talk!\" Connel growled. \"And tell it all.\"\n\nBarret had hardly uttered the first stumbling words when Roger let out a\nshout of alarm. \"Hey! The scanner!\" he cried.\n\nThey all turned to the teleceiver screen. To their horror, they saw a\nmenacing shape blasting toward them. They recognized it instantly--a\nspace torpedo!\n\nAstro dove through the power-deck hatch while Roger raced for the\nradar-bridge ladder. Tom hurled himself into the copilot's chair, and\nwith Connel beside him in the command position, he waited for Astro to\nsupply power. Suddenly the ship trembled violently and then shot forward\nas, far below, the jet exhausts screamed under the full thrust of all\nthe atomic reactors. Tom rode the controls hard and kept his eye on the\nscanner screen.\n\n\"It's a magnetic gyrofish!\" he cried as he saw the torpedo curve after\nthem. \"Roger, can you plot her for me?\"\n\n\"Working on it now, Tom!\" yelled Roger over the intercom.\n\n\"How in blazes did that thing get out here?\" muttered Connel.\n\n\"We'll have to worry about that later, I'm afraid, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\"We're going to have our hands full getting away from her. With that\nmagnetic warhead, she'll follow us all over space unless we can throw\nher off.\"\n\n\"Which will take some doing!\" grunted Connel, frowning in deep concern.\n\n\"Hey, Tom!\" Roger's voice called over the intercom. \"It's blasting on\nmaximum thrust now. We have a pretty good chance. Use that idea we\nworked out. Make a series of left turns and always on the up-plane of\nthe ecliptic!\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Tom, clutching the master manual-control lever and\nbeginning to fly the giant ship through space by \"feel.\"\n\n\"What in blazes are you doing, Corbett?\" shouted Connel in sudden alarm.\n\n\"Just hang on and watch, sir,\" replied Tom, keeping his eyes on the\nscanner where he could see the space torpedo trailing them. Over and\nover, Tom kept slamming the ship into sharp left turns, while the\ntorpedo followed in an ever-narrowing circle.\n\n\"All right, Tom!\" yelled Roger again. \"Give it the same thing on the\nright and the down-plane of the ecliptic!\"\n\n\"Check!\" answered Tom, reversing his controls and sending the ship\ncorkscrewing through space on an opposite course.\n\nConnel grabbed the arms of his chair and gasped, \"You kids are space\nhappy!\"\n\n\"Those gyros are so perfect, sir,\" said Tom, working the controls\nquickly and smoothly, \"that the only way you can throw them off balance\nis to confuse them.\"\n\n\"Confuse them!\" exclaimed Connel.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"It's a theory Roger and I worked out together. No\ngyro is perfect, and if you can get it bouncing back and forth in\nextreme turns, it will be thrown out of balance. Then all we have to do\nis make the torpedo miss once and it won't come back.\"\n\n\"Heaven help us all!\" was Connel's groaning reply.\n\n\"On the ball, Tom!\" cried Roger. \"She's closing in on us!\"\n\n\"I see her,\" replied Tom calmly. \"Hang on, everybody. I'm going to turn\nthis ship inside out!\"\n\nJerking the controls, Tom threw the ship into a mad, whirling spin,\nsubjecting the vessel to the most severe strain tests it would ever\nundergo. The hull groaned and creaked, and badly fitted equipment tore\nloose and clattered across the deck. Suddenly the young cadet leveled\nthe ship.\n\n\"Nose braking rockets, Astro!\" he called.\n\n\"Braking rockets, aye!\" acknowledged the Venusian over the intercom.\n\nOn the power deck, Astro jammed the forward drive closed and slammed\nopen the nose rockets. The ship trembled, bucked, and finally came to a\nshuddering stop before it started a reverse course, accelerating\nquickly.\n\n\"Here it comes!\" yelled Roger.\n\nAs Connel and Tom watched tensely, the space torpedo loomed large and\nmenacing on the scanner, and then, as they held their breaths, it\nwhistled past the silvery hull of the ship, with less than two feet to\nspare!\n\nSighing deeply, Tom brought the ship back to level flight. \"We're O.K.\nnow, sir,\" he said. \"Her gyros are out. She won't come back.\"\n\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" Connel suddenly exploded. \"The Solar Guard\nspends a fortune to develop a foolproof space torpedo and two hot-shot\ncadets come along and get away from the blasted thing! Why haven't you\ntold this to anyone before?\"\n\n\"Why--er--\" stammered Tom, \"we've never had the chance to prove it,\nsir.\"\n\nBehind them, the power-deck hatch suddenly opened and Astro stepped in.\n\"Nice work, Tom!\" he called.\n\n\"And as for you, you Venusian ape,\" roared Connel, \"don't you realize\nthat you can blow a reactor tube by throwing so much power into a ship\nwithout energizing the cooling pumps first?\"\n\nAstro smiled. \"Not if you open the by-pass, sir,\" he said, \"and feed\ndirectly off the pump reservoir. The gas cools the tube and at the same\ntime expands itself and adds to the power thrust.\"\n\nAt Astro's easy reply Connel could only stand openmouthed in\namazement. Again, one of the three cadets of the _Polaris_ unit had\ndeveloped a revolutionary procedure that even top rocket scientists\nwould be proud to call their own.\n\nWinking at Tom, Astro turned away and suddenly noticed Barret sprawled\non the deck, unconscious.\n\n\"What happened to him?\" asked the big Venusian.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot all about him,\" said Tom. \"Guess he didn't get into an\nacceleration chair in time. Better get some more water.\"\n\n\"We haven't time for him now!\" snapped Connel. \"Strap him in good and\ntight. We've got to find out where that torpedo came from.\"\n\nAs though in answer to the major's order, there was a sudden call over\nthe ship's intercom.\n\n\"Radar bridge to control deck, check in!\" There was a note of alarm in\nRoger's voice.\n\nTom jumped to the control panel to reply.\n\n\"Control deck, aye!\" he snapped into the microphone.\n\n\"There's a spaceship to starboard!\" called Roger. \"Distance twenty\nmiles, fifteen degrees up on the plane of the ecliptic. And I swear\nshe's maneuvering to fire another torpedo!\"\n\n\"Stand by action stations!\" roared Connel, diving into his chair before\nthe control panel. Tom strapped in next to him, while Astro made a\nheadlong dash for the power deck.\n\n\"Yes!\" shouted Roger. \"She's fired a torpedo!\"\n\n\"Raise her! Raise her!\" bellowed Connel. \"Tell them who we are!\" He\nturned to Tom. \"Go into your act, Corbett,\" he said, \"and make it good!\"\n\nAs Tom manipulated the controls again, the silver ship plunged through\nspace, turning and gyrating in the same series of maneuvers it had\nperformed to escape the first torpedo. But this time the distance\nseparating them was not as great and the torpedo closed in quickly.\n\n\"Can't you raise that ship yet, Manning?\" Connel roared into the\nintercom.\n\n\"I just have, sir,\" replied Roger in a strained voice. \"But it's--\"\n\n\"Let me talk to that lame brain of a skipper,\" interrupted Connel. \"By\nthe stars, I'll teach him to--\"\n\n\"It's no use, Connel,\" said a gruff voice over the control-deck\nloud-speaker. \"Even if you duck this torpedo, I've got ten more!\"\n\n\"Who is this?\" roared Connel.\n\n\"Don't you know, Connel? Why, I'm surprised!\"\n\nThe teleceiver screen glowed into life and Tom and Connel stared in\nhorror as they recognized the images of three men. The one in the\nforeground smiled mockingly and said, \"Remember me, Connel?\"\n\n\"Devers!\" Connel roared.\n\n\"And the other two behind him--\" stuttered Tom. \"Cag and Monty!\"\n\n\"Why, you dirty space crawler,\" cried Connel, \"I'll get you if it's the\nlast thing I do!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, you won't, Major.\" Devers laughed. \"The last thing you'll do is\nkiss a space torpedo. Then no more Major Blast-off Connel, no more\nwhimpering Professor Hemmingwell, and most important, no more projectile\nship!\"\n\nAnd as Devers laughed loudly, Tom threw the ship into another violent\nturn and cried, \"It's no use, Major. I can't duck this one!\"\n\n\"All hands brace for torpedo!\" warned Connel.\n\nSuddenly there was an explosion aft. The ship lurched and shuddered\nviolently, spinning through space, and as Tom fought the controls,\neverything went black. The ship drifted helplessly, out of control.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\n\"Turn on the lights! Cut in the emergency batteries!\"\n\nConnel's bull-throated roar carried through the ship as he stood on the\npower deck with Astro and shouted to Tom on the control deck. The space\ntorpedo had destroyed the stern of the vessel, and if it hadn't been for\nAstro's quick action in sealing off the aftersection of the ship, all\nthe air might have been lost and the crew dead of suffocation.\n\nA moment later the emergency lights glowed weakly and Connel and the big\nVenusian cadet began a quick inspection of the ship. The power deck was\na total loss. The ship would never get under way again.\n\nUp on the radar bridge, Roger was about to turn on the radar scanner\nwhen Tom appeared and stopped him.\n\n\"Wait a while, Roger,\" he said. \"We may need the power for something\nelse.\"\n\n\"What, for instance?\" snorted Roger.\n\n\"That ship is still out there, probably closing in for the kill.\"\n\n\"A blasted lot we can do about it,\" Roger growled.\n\n\"I've got a plan that might work,\" said Tom half-heartedly. \"It's about\nthe only thing I can think of, unless Connel and Astro have a better\nidea.\"\n\n\"What is it? Whatever it is, it's better than sitting here like a dead\nduck, waiting for that rat to come in and finish us off!\" said Roger.\n\"Look, I've just got to see what he's doing out there.\" He flipped on\nthe scanner switch and while he waited for the set to warm up he turned\nback to Tom. \"What's your idea?\"\n\n\"Well,\" began Tom, \"the only thing we've got on board that we can use to\nfight back with are those projectiles.\"\n\n\"How can we fight with projectiles?\" demanded Roger. \"They don't carry\nwarheads!\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Tom. \"But they're big and heavy. They pack a wallop if they\nhit anything.\"\n\nRoger's eyes brightened suddenly. \"Say, I think--\"\n\nThe scanner began to beep and Roger turned his attention to the screen.\nTom leaned over his shoulder and watched eagerly. They both saw Devers'\nship flying in a slow circle around them.\n\n\"Probably looking to see which would be the best way to let us have it!\"\nsnarled Roger.\n\nAt that moment Major Connel climbed into the radar bridge, followed by\nAstro.\n\n\"Time to go,\" announced the officer.\n\n\"Go where?\" demanded Roger.\n\n\"We have to abandon ship,\" declared Connel. \"The power deck is shot.\nWe'll never get under way, and we're just sitting ducks if we stay\naboard.\"\n\n\"What's to prevent Devers from picking us off while we're outside?\"\nasked Roger.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Connel. \"But he'll have a harder job and maybe he won't\nget all of us.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said Tom with a glance at Roger, \"I have an idea.\"\n\n\"Let's have it,\" said Connel.\n\n\"The projectiles, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\n\"We can still fire them off the emergency batteries, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you get to the point, Corbett?\" growled Connel. \"Devers is liable\nto send another torpedo our way any second and--\" Connel suddenly\nstopped and his eyes widened. \"A torpedo!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Exactly, sir!\" exclaimed Tom. \"We have five projectiles! We can use\nthem as torpedoes!\"\n\n\"Jumping Jupiter!\" exclaimed Astro. \"What a terrific idea!\"\n\n\"What a terrific pipe dream!\" snapped Connel. \"Those projectiles don't\nhave any warheads!\"\n\n\"They could still do a lot of damage if they hit that ship,\" asserted\nTom.\n\n\"And how do you expect to aim them?\" demanded Connel. \"There's not\nenough juice in the batteries to steer them!\"\n\n\"We'll just fire them straight ahead, sir,\" broke in Roger. \"Look!\" he\ncontinued, pointing to the scanner screen. \"Devers' ship is just\ncircling us now. And he's on the same plane of the ecliptic. If he holds\nthat course--\"\n\n\"He'll cross our bow!\" exclaimed Astro excitedly. \"A perfect shot!\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" shouted Connel. \"Preposterous! It'll never work in a\nmillion light years! He'll fire another torpedo and we'll be blasted\ninto space dust!\"\n\n\"But we can try it, can't we, sir?\" asked Tom, grinning.\n\n\"Of course we can!\" roared Connel. \"I've never given up a battle yet\nand, by the stars, I'm not going to now!\"\n\nForgetting rank and protocol, the three cadets danced around the major,\nslapping him on the back and howling their enthusiasm. Connel could not\nrestrain a momentary grin and then his features assumed his usual\nbulldog look.\n\n\"Knock it off!\" he shouted. \"We've got work to do. Manning!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Keep your eyes nailed to that scanner!\" Connel bellowed. \"Sing out if\nDevers changes course by so much as a hair!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\"\n\n\"Astro!\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Put space suits on Professor Hemmingwell and Barret and stand by with\nthem on the control deck.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\"\n\n\"Corbett, you and I will check the projectiles. Make sure they're in\nfiring order!\"\n\nSpinning on his heel, Connel left the radar bridge. Alone for just an\ninstant, the three cadets of the _Polaris_ unit clasped hands in silent\ndetermination and then plunged into their various assignments.\n\nFive minutes later, Connel and Tom returned to the control deck to find\nAstro waiting for them. Professor Hemmingwell and Barret, both in space\nsuits, were seated on acceleration couches. As Connel walked up to him,\nHemmingwell raised his head slowly, still under the effects of the\nsedative.\n\n\"What's--what's happening, Major?\" he asked haltingly.\n\n\"Professor,\" said Connel, \"one of two things is going to happen. Either\nyour ship will be blown to space dust or Carter Devers will be finished\nand we'll bring your ship back to Earth!\"\n\n\"Good, good,\" murmured Hemmingwell.\n\n\"And as for you, Barret\"--Connel turned toward the man angrily--\"now you\ncan see what kind of thanks you get for your dirty work! Your boss is\njust as willing to get rid of you as he is to destroy this project!\"\n\nBarret flushed under Connel's glare and turned away.\n\nAt the control panel, Tom opened the circuits to the five loaded firing\nchambers and then turned to Connel. \"All set to fire, sir!\" he called.\n\n\n\"Any word from Manning?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Not while I've been here,\" replied Astro.\n\nConnel picked up the intercom microphone. \"Hello, Manning!\" he shouted.\n\"What's the story?\"\n\n\"Coming up to the last chapter,\" replied Roger over the intercom.\n\"Devers is holding course. Should cross our bow in two minutes!\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied Connel. \"Keep us posted!\"\n\nReplacing the microphone, he turned to Tom. \"Stupid fool!\" he snorted.\n\"He should've fired another torpedo and wiped us out. What's the matter\nwith him?\" Connel abhorred stupidity, even in an adversary.\n\n\"Maybe he thinks we've already had it,\" suggested Astro. \"With our stern\nblasted away, he might figure all the air's gone out of the ship.\"\n\n\"Let's hope he keeps on figuring that way,\" said Connel. \"Everything\nready to fire, Corbett?\"\n\n\"All set, sir,\" the young cadet replied. \"I've hooked up all circuits to\nthis button.\" He pointed to a button on the control panel. \"We'll blast\nin salvo.\"\n\n\"Oh, we will, will we?\" exclaimed Connel.\n\n\"If you think it's advisable,\" Tom amended hurriedly.\n\n\"Of course it's advisable!\" snorted Connel. \"We're almost aiming blind\nas it is. A salvo will give us a bigger spread. Besides,\" he added,\n\"with a whole barrel of luck, we might hit him with two of the\nprojectiles. That would really do some damage.\"\n\n\"I'd like just a little potful of luck,\" murmured Astro, \"and be able to\nland one.\"\n\n\"Heads up, down there!\" Roger's voice suddenly sang out on the intercom.\n\n\"Devers crossing our bow yet?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"He's still holding course,\" said Roger. \"But he's training his number\none starboard tube this way. He's going to blast us again!\"\n\n\"How long do we have to wait for that bow shot?\" demanded Connel.\n\n\"Another forty-five seconds at least!\" came Roger's reply.\n\n\"Blast it!\" muttered Connel. \"Plenty of time for him to fire.\"\n\nBarret suddenly rose from his acceleration couch, screaming, \"You can't\nkeep me here! Let me go!\"\n\nAstro grabbed him quickly and threw him back down. \"Stay put,\" he\ngrowled.\n\n\"No,\" cried Barret, frantic with fear. \"It's murder! Let me go!\"\n\n\"Relax and enjoy it, Barret,\" snorted Connel. \"It's your boss who's\ndoing it!\"\n\n\"What about Professor Hemmingwell, sir?\" asked Tom. \"Shouldn't we--?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hemmingwell spoke up from his daze. \"I want to stay with my ship.\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Roger cried over the intercom. \"We're getting company!\"\n\n\"Company?\" exclaimed Tom. \"What're you talking about?\"\n\n\"A Solar Guard cruiser,\" replied Roger. \"Coming up to port. About five\nhundred miles away. Hey! It's the _Polaris_!\"\n\n\"It must be Captain Strong!\" shouted Tom.\n\n\"He won't do us much good now,\" muttered Connel. \"How much time do we\nhave, Roger?\"\n\n\"Get set down there. Only another ten seconds and Devers will be right\non our bow.\"\n\n\"On the ball, Tom!\" ordered Connel.\n\n\"Ready, sir.\"\n\nThe seconds ticked by slowly. One--two--three--four--Beads of sweat\nappeared on Connel's brow. Astro clenched and unclenched his fists.\nHemmingwell closed his eyes calmly and waited. Barret slumped back in\nhis couch, almost paralyzed with fear.\n\n\"Coming up, Tom!\" cried Roger.\n\nTom didn't reply. He kept his fingers poised on the firing button. And\nthe seconds ticked off slowly, maddeningly. Seven--eight--nine--!\n\n\"They've fired,\" Roger shouted. \"Point-blank! We're going to get it!\"\n\n\"Fire, Tom!\" shouted Connel.\n\nEven as Connel spoke, Tom's finger pressed down hard on the firing\nbutton. The ship quivered as five projectiles blasted from the firing\nchambers and winged their deadly way through space. The control room of\nthe ship was silent, everyone waiting for the impact of the torpedo and\npraying that somehow, someway, they could know whether their own attack\nhad succeeded even if they lost their own lives in the attempt to\ndestroy Devers' ship.\n\nThere was a sudden, blasting roar and a brilliant white flash of light\nfilled the cabin. The deck heaved violently, then dropped sickeningly.\nUnder the force of the explosion, everyone was thrown to the deck and\nlay deathly still.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the wardroom of the rocket cruiser _Polaris_, Captain Strong, Major\nConnel, Professor Hemmingwell, and Roger and Astro were sipping tea and\ncalmly discussing the events of the past hour.\n\n\"Your ship wasn't too badly damaged, Professor,\" said Strong. \"We'll\ntake her in tow and bring her back to Space Academy. She'll be good as\nnew.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to do without the services of Dave Barret\nthough, sir,\" commented Connel dryly. \"He's got a previous engagement on\na prison asteroid and it's going to take him a long time.\"\n\n\"I can do very well without him,\" said Hemmingwell. \"As a matter of\nfact, I would have done extremely well without him before.\" He paused\nand shook his head. \"I feel so ashamed of myself when I think of the\nthings I said to those boys.\" He nodded toward Astro and Roger. \"And all\nthe time they were right.\"\n\nAstro grinned shyly. Roger was about to open his mouth and make a\ntypically flip remark when the hatch opened and Tom appeared, a bandage\ncovering his head. The two cadets jumped toward him and snowed him under\nwith affectionate slaps on the back.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" cried Tom. \"I'm injured. Look at my head!\"\n\n\"You couldn't have hit the control panel with anything better!\" snorted\nConnel.\n\n\"But what happened?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Two of the projectiles hit Devers' ship,\" said Roger. \"One of them on\nthe power deck. Must've smashed the reaction tanks and made the stuff\nwildcat, because it blew him into rocket dust!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_The projectiles blew Devers' ship into rocket\ndust!_\"]\n\n\"But his torpedo! He fired at the same time!\" said Tom.\n\n\"This unit is the luckiest in the universe,\" said Roger proudly. \"One of\nthe other projectiles smacked the torpedo and exploded the warhead. We\nwere bounced around by the shock wave but that's all!\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be a Martian mouse,\" sighed Tom. \"Then everything is O.K.\nnow?\"\n\n\"So far as you three are concerned, it's perfect,\" said Strong. \"Barret\nhas spilled everything. You're cleared of all charges!\"\n\n\"What about Pat Troy?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"He's in the clear, too,\" said Strong. \"You may remember that he refused\nto tell us who he was working for besides Professor Hemmingwell and that\nmade us suspicious of him. Well, we found out, when he regained\nconsciousness a short time ago, that he is a security agent for the\nSolar Alliance Council. He had been assigned to work with the professor\nand to help protect him. Barret has admitted that he tried to murder\nTroy.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" snorted Connel, suddenly rising.\n\nThe room was intensely quiet and Tom, Astro, and Roger felt that there\nwas something coming. Strong could hardly suppress a grin as Connel took\na paper from his tunic.\n\n\"This message was received just fifteen minutes ago,\" he said. \"It\nreads, quote, Major Connel, Solar Guard. With reference to Operation\nSpace Projectile, information has come to us that the Space Cadet unit,\nknown as the _Polaris_ unit, has contributed in an outstanding and\nextraordinary way to the successful completion of this highly valuable\nproject. As Senior Line Officer of the Academy, it is hereby requested\nthat you bestow upon this unit some form of expression of the gratitude\nof this Council for their remarkable and inspired behavior in the face\nof relentless odds. Signed, Secretary General, Solar Council, Venusport,\nVenus. Fourteenth of June, 2354, end quote.\"\n\nConnel slipped the paper inside his tunic and faced the three cadets.\n\n\"All right, you heard it!\" he growled. \"And you deserve it. You have\nthree weeks' leave. But when you come back,\" he added, \"watch out!\"\n\n\"Oh, for the life of a Space Cadet!\" said Tom, grinning at his unit\nmates. \"It's wonderful!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Transcriber's Notes                                          |\n|                                                              |\n|                                                              |\n| The following typos have been corrected.                     |\n|                                                              |\n| particularly              particular                         |\n| stomach.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
