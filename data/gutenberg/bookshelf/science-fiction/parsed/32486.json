But it was also the only way a man could qualify\nfor--The Legion Of Lazarus]\n\n\n_It isn't the dying itself. It's what comes before. The waiting, alone\nin a room without windows, trying to think. The opening of the door, the\nvoices of the men who are going with you but not all the way, the walk\ndown the corridor to the airlock room, the faces of the men, closed and\nimpersonal. They do not enjoy this. Neither do they shrink from it. It's\ntheir job._\n\n_This is the room. It is small and it has a window. Outside there is no\nfriendly sky, no clouds. There is space, and there is the huge red\ncircle of Mars filling the sky, looking down like an enormous eye upon\nthis tiny moon. But you do not look up. You look out._\n\n_There are men out there. They are quite naked. They sleep upon the\nbarren plain, drowsing in a timeless ocean. Their bodies are white as\nivory and their hair is loose across their faces. Some of them seem to\nsmile. They lie, and sleep, and the great red eye looks at them forever\nas they are borne around it._\n\n\"_It isn't so bad,\" says one of the men who are with you inside this\nultimate room. \"Fifty years from now, the rest of us will all be old, or\ndead._\"\n\n_It is small comfort._\n\n_The one garment you have worn is taken from you and the lock door\nopens, and the fear that cannot possibly become greater does become\ngreater, and then suddenly that terrible crescendo is past. There is no\nlonger any hope, and you learn that without hope there is little to be\nafraid of. You want now only to get it over with._\n\n_You step forward into the lock._\n\n_The door behind you shuts. You sense that the one before you is\nopening, but there is not much time. The burst of air carries you\nforward. Perhaps you scream, but you are now beyond sound, beyond sight,\nbeyond everything. You do not even feel that it is cold._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThere is a time for sleep, and a time for waking. But Hyrst had slept\nheavily, and the waking was hard. He had slept long, and the waking was\nslow. _Fifty years_, said the dim voice of remembrance. But another part\nof his mind said, No, it is only tomorrow morning.\n\nAnother part of his mind. That was strange. There seemed to be more\nparts to his mind than he remembered having had before, but they were\nall confused and hidden behind a veil of mist. Perhaps they were not\nreally there at all. Perhaps--\n\n_Fifty years. I have been dead_, he thought, _and now I live again.\nHalf a century. Strange._\n\nHyrst lay on a narrow bed, in a place of subdued light and\nantiseptic-smelling air. There was no one else in the room. There was no\nsound.\n\n_Fifty years_, he thought. _What is it like now, the house where I lived\nonce, the country, the planet? Where are my children, where are my\nfriends, my enemies, the people I loved, the people I hated?_\n\n_Where is Elena? Where is my wife?_\n\nA whisper out of nowhere, sad, remote. _Your wife is dead and your\nchildren are old. Forget them. Forget the friends and the enemies._\n\n_But I can't forget!_ cried Hyrst silently in the spaces of his own\nmind. It was only yesterday--\n\n_Fifty years_, said the whisper. _And you must forget._\n\n_MacDonald_, said Hyrst suddenly. _I didn't kill him. I was innocent. I\ncan't forget that._\n\n_Careful_, said the whisper. _Watch out._\n\n_I didn't kill MacDonald. Somebody did. Somebody let me pay for it. Who?\nWas it Landers? Was it Saul? We four were together out there on Titan,\nwhen he died._\n\n_Careful_, Hyrst. _They're coming. Listen to me. You think this is your\nown mind speaking, question-and-answer. But it isn't._\n\nHyrst sprang upright on the narrow bed, his heart pounding, the sweat\nrunning cold on his skin. _Who are you? Where are you? How--_\n\n_They're here_, said the whisper calmly. _Be quiet._\n\nTwo men came into the ward. \"I am Dr. Merridew,\" said the one in the\nwhite coverall, smiling at Hyrst with a brisk professional smile. \"This\nis Warden Meister. We didn't mean to startle you. There are a few\nquestions, before we release you--\"\n\n_Merridew_, said the whisper in Hyrst's mind, _is a psychiatrist. Let\nme handle this._\n\nHyrst sat still, his hands lax between his knees, his eyes wide and\nfixed in astonishment. He heard the psychiatrist's questions, and he\nheard the answers he gave to them, but he was merely an instrument, with\nno conscious volition, it was the whisperer in his mind who was\nanswering. Then the warden shuffled some papers he held in his hand and\nasked questions of his own.\n\n\"You underwent the Humane Penalty without admitting your guilt. For the\nrecord, now that the penalty has been paid, do you wish to change your\nfinal statements?\"\n\nThe voice in Hyrst's mind, the secret voice, said swiftly to him. _Don't\nargue with them, don't get angry, or they'll keep you on and on here._\n\n\"But--\" thought Hyrst.\n\n_I know you're innocent, but they'll never believe it. They'll keep you\non for further psychiatric tests. They might get near the truth,\nHyrst--the truth about us._\n\nSuddenly Hyrst began to understand, not all and not clearly, something\nof what had happened to him. The obscuring mists began to lift from the\nborders of his mind.\n\n\"What is the truth,\" he asked in that inner quiet, \"about us?\"\n\n_You've spent fifty years in the Valley of the Shadow. You're changed,\nHyrst. You're not quite human any more. No one is, who goes through the\nfreeze. But they don't know that._\n\n\"Then you too--\"\n\n_Yes. And I too changed. And that is why our minds can speak, even\nthough I am on Mars and you are on its moon. But they must not know\nthat. So don't argue, don't show emotion!_\n\nThe warden was waiting. Hyrst said aloud to him, slowly. \"I have no\nstatement to make.\"\n\nThe warden did not seem surprised. He went on, \"According to your papers\nhere you also denied knowing the location of the Titanite for which\nMacDonald was presumably murdered. Do you still deny that?\"\n\nHyrst was honestly surprised. \"But surely, by now--\"\n\nThe warden shrugged. \"According to this data, it never came to light.\"\n\n\"I never knew,\" said Hyrst, \"where it was.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the warden, \"I've asked the question and that's as far as\nmy responsibility goes. But there's a visitor who has permission to see\nyou.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe and the doctor went out. Hyrst watched them go. He thought, So I'm\nnot quite human. Not quite human any more. Does that make me more, or\nless, than a man?\n\n_Both_, said the secret voice. _Their minds are still closed to you.\nOnly our minds--we who have changed too--are open._\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Hyrst.\n\n_My name is Shearing. Now listen. When you are released, they'll bring\nyou down here to Mars. I'll be waiting for you. I'll help you._\n\n\"Why? What do you care about me, or a murder fifty years old?\"\n\n_I'll tell you why later_, said the whisper of Shearing. _But you must\nfollow my guidance. There's danger for you, Hyrst, from the moment\nyou're released! There are those who have been waiting for you._\n\n\"Danger? But--\"\n\nThe door opened, and Hyrst's visitor came in. He was a man something\nover sixty but the deep lines in his face made him look older. His face\nwas gray and drawn and twitching, but it became perfectly rigid and\nwhite when he came to the foot of the bed and looked at Hyrst. There was\nrage in his eyes, a rage so old and weary that it brought tears to them.\n\n\"You should have stayed dead,\" he said to Hyrst. \"Why couldn't they let\nyou stay dead?\"\n\nHyrst was shocked and startled. \"Who are you? And why--\"\n\nThe other man was not even listening. His eyelids had closed, and when\nthey opened again they looked on naked agony. \"It isn't right,\" he said.\n\"A murderer should die, and stay dead. Not come back.\"\n\n\"I didn't murder MacDonald,\" Hyrst said, with the beginnings of anger.\n\"And I don't know why you--\"\n\nHe stopped. The white, aging face, the tear-filled, furious eyes, he did\nnot quite know what there was about them but it was there, like an old\nremembered face peeping up through a blur of water for a moment, and\nthen withdrawing again.\n\nAfter a moment, Hyrst said hoarsely, \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't know it,\" said the other. \"I changed it, long ago.\"\n\nHyrst felt a cold, and it seemed that he could not breathe. He said,\n\"But you were only eleven--\"\n\nHe could not go on. There was a terrible silence between them. He must\nbreak it, he could not let it go on. He must speak. But all he could say\nwas to whisper, \"I'm not a murderer. You must believe it. I'm going to\nprove it--\"\n\n\"You murdered MacDonald. And you murdered my mother. I watched her age\nand die, spending every penny, spending every drop of her blood and\nours, to get you back again. I pretended for fifty years that I too\nbelieved you were innocent, when all the time I knew.\"\n\nHyrst said, \"I'm innocent.\" He tried to say a name, too, but he could\nnot speak the word.\n\n\"No. You're lying, as you lied then. We found out. Mother hired\ndetectives, experts. Over and over, for decades--and always they found\nthe same thing. Landers and Saul could not possibly have killed\nMacDonald, and you were the only other human being there. Proof? I can\nshow you barrels of it. And all of it proof that my father was a\nmurderer.\"\n\nHe leaned a little toward Hyrst, and the tears ran down his lined,\ncareworn face. He said, \"All right, you've come back. Alive, still\nyoung. But I'm warning you. If you try again to get that Titanite, if\nyou shame us all again after all this time, if you even come near us,\nI'll kill you.\"\n\nHe went out. Hyrst sat, looking after him, and he thought that no man\nbefore him had ever felt what tore him now.\n\nInside his mind came Shearing's whisper, with a totally unexpected note\nof compassion. _But some of us have, Hyrst. Welcome to the brotherhood.\nWelcome to the Legion of Lazarus._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nMars roared and glittered tonight. And how was a man to stand the faces\nand lights and sounds, when he had come back from the silence of\neternity?\n\nHyrst walked through the flaring streets of Syrtis City with slow and\ndragging steps. It was like being back on Earth. For this city was not\nreally part of the old dead planet, of the dark barrens that rolled away\nbeneath the night. This was the place of the rocket-men, the miners, the\nschemers, the workers, who had come from another, younger world. Their\nbars and entertainment houses flung a sun-like brilliance. Their ships,\nlifting majestically skyward from the distant spaceport, wrote their\nflaming sign on the sky. Only here and there moved one of the hooded,\nrobed humanoids who had once owned this world.\n\n_The next corner_, said the whisper in Hyrst's mind. _Turn there. No,\nnot toward the spaceport. The other way._\n\nHyrst thought suddenly, \"Shearing.\"\n\n_Yes?_\n\n\"I am being followed.\"\n\nHis physical ears heard nothing but the voices and music. His physical\neyes saw only the street crowd. Yet he knew. He knew it by a picture\nthat kept coming into his mind, of a blurred shape moving always behind\nhim.\n\n_Of course you're being followed_, came Shearing's thought. _I told you\nthey've been waiting for you. This is the corner. Turn._\n\nHyrst turned. It was a darker street, running away from the lights\nthrough black warehouses and on the labyrinthine monolithic houses of\nthe humanoids.\n\n_Now look back_, Shearing commanded. _No, not with your eyes! With your\nmind. Learn to use your talents._\n\nHyrst tried. The blurred image in his mind came clearer, and clearer\nstill, and it was a young man with a vicious mouth and flat uncaring\neyes. Hyrst shivered. \"Who is he?\"\n\n_He works for the men who have been waiting for you, Hyrst. Bring him\nthis way._\n\n\"This--way?\"\n\n_Look ahead. With your mind. Can't you learn?_\n\nStung to sudden anger, Hyrst flung out a mental probe with a power he\nhadn't known he possessed. In a place of total darkness between two\nwarehouses ahead, he saw a tall man lounging at his ease. Shearing\nlaughed.\n\n_Yes, it's me. Just walk past me. Don't hurry._\n\nHyrst glanced backward, mentally at the man following him through the\nshadows. He was closer now, and quite silent. His face was tight and\nsecret. Hyrst thought, How do I know this Shearing isn't in it with him,\ntaking me into a place where they can both get at me--\n\nHe went past the two warehouses and he did not turn his head but his\nmind saw Shearing waiting in the darkness. Then there was a soft,\nshapeless sound, and he turned and saw Shearing bending over a huddled\nform.\n\n\"That was unkind of you,\" said Shearing, speaking aloud but not loudly.\n\nHyrst, still shaking, said, \"But not exactly strange. I've never seen\nyou before. And I still don't know what this is all about.\"\n\nShearing smiled, as he knelt beside the prone, unmoving body. Even here\nin the shadows, Hyrst could see him with these new eyes of the mind.\nShearing was a big man. His hair was grizzled along the sides of his\nhead, and his eyes were dark and very keen. He reached out one hand and\nturned the head of the prone young man, and they looked at the lax,\nloose face.\n\n\"He's not dead?\" said Hyrst.\n\n\"Of course not. But it will be a while before he wakes.\"\n\n\"But who is he?\"\n\nShearing stood up. \"I never saw him before. But I know who he's working\nfor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHyrst flung a sudden question at Shearing, and almost without thinking\nhe followed it to surprise the answer in Shearing's mind. The question\nwas, _Who are you working for_? And the answer was a woman, a tall and\nhandsome woman with angry eyes, standing against a drift of stars. There\nwas a ship, all lonely on a dark plain, and she was pointing to it, and\nsomehow Hyrst knew that it was vitally important to her, and to\nShearing, and perhaps even to himself. But before he could do more than\nregister this fleeting vision on his own consciousness, Shearing's mind\nslammed shut with exactly the same violent effect as a door slammed in\nhis face. He reeled back, throwing up his arms in a futile but\ninstinctive gesture, and Shearing said angrily,\n\n\"You're getting too good. I'll give you a social hint--it's customary to\nknock before you enter.\"\n\nHyrst said, still holding the pieces of his head together, \"All\nright--sorry. So who is she?\"\n\n\"She's one of us. She wants what we want.\"\n\n\"I want only to find out who murdered MacDonald!\"\n\n\"You want more than that, Hyrst, though you don't know it yet. But\nMacDonald's murderer is part of what we're after.\"\n\nHe took Hyrst's arm. \"We don't have long. Thanks to my guidance, you\nslipped them all except this one. But they'll be hounding after our\ntrail very quickly.\"\n\nThey went on along the shadowed street. The glare of the lights died\nback behind them, and they moved in darkness with only the keen stars to\nwatch them, and the cold, gritty wind blowing in from the barrens, and\nthe dark door-ways of the mastaba-like monolithic houses of the\nhumanoids staring at them like sightless eyes. Hyrst looked up at the\nbright, tiny moon that crept amid the stars, and a deep shaking took him\nas he thought of men lying up there in the deathly sleep, of himself\nlying there year after year....\n\n\"In here,\" said Shearing. It was one of the frigid, musty tombs that the\nhumanoids called home. It was dark and there was nothing in it at all.\n\"We can't risk a light. We don't need it, anyway.\"\n\nThey sat down. Hyrst said desperately, \"Listen, I want to know some\nthings. Exactly what are we doing here?\"\n\nShearing answered deliberately, \"We are hiding from those who want you,\nand we are waiting for a chance to go to our friends.\"\n\n\"Our friends? Your friends, maybe. That woman--I don't know her, and--\"\n\n\"Now _you_ listen, Hyrst. I'll tell you this much about us now. We're\nLazarites, like you, with the same powers as you. But all Lazarites are\nnot on _our_ side.\"\n\nHyrst thought about that. \"Then those others who are hunting us--\"\n\n\"There are Lazarites among them, too. Not many, but a few. You don't\nknow us, you don't know them. Do you want to leave me and go back out\nand let them have you?\"\n\nHyrst remembered the adder-like face of the young man who had come after\nhim through the shadows. After a long moment he said, \"Well. But what\nare _you_ after?\"\n\n\"The thing that MacDonald was killed for, fifty years ago.\"\n\nHyrst said, \"The Titanite? They said it hadn't ever been found. But how\nit could have remained hidden so long--\"\n\n\"I want you,\" Shearing said, \"to tell me all about how MacDonald died.\nEverything you can remember.\"\n\nHyrst asked eagerly, \"You think we can find out who killed him? After\nall this time? God, if we could--my son--\"\n\n\"Quiet, Hyrst. Go ahead and tell me. Not in words. Just remember what\nhappened, and I'll get it.\"\n\nYet, by sheer lifetime habit, Hyrst could not remember without first\nputting it into words in his own mind, as they two sat in the cold,\nwhispering darkness.\n\n\"There were four of us out there on Titan, you must already know that.\nAnd only four--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour men. And one was named MacDonald, an engineer, a secretive, selfish\nand enormously greedy man. MacDonald was the man who found a fortune,\nand kept it secret, and died.\n\nLanders was one. A lean, brown, lively man, an excellent physicist with\na friendly manner and no obvious ambitions.\n\nSaul was one, and he was big and blond and quiet, a good drinking\ncompanion, a good geologist, a lover of good music. If he had any darker\npassions, he kept them hidden.\n\nHyrst was the fourth man, and the only one of the four still living....\n\nHe remembered now. He saw the black and bitter crags of Titan stark\nagainst the glory of the Rings, and he saw two figures moving across a\nplain of methane snow, their helmets gleaming in the Saturn-light.\nBehind them in the plain were the flat, half-buried concrete structures\nof the little refinery, and all around them were the spidery roads where\nthe big half-tracs dragged their loads of uranium ore from the\nenchaining mountains.\n\nThe two men were quarrelling.\n\n\"You're angry,\" MacDonald was saying, \"because it was _I_ who found it.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Hyrst said. \"We're sick, all three of us, of hearing you brag\nabout it.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you are,\" said MacDonald smugly. \"The first find of a Titanite\npocket for years. The rarest, costliest stuff in the System. If you know\nthe way they've been bidding to buy it from me--\"\n\n\"I do know,\" Hyrst said. \"You've done nothing for weeks but give forth\nmysterious hints--\"\n\n\"And you don't like that,\" MacDonald said. \"Of course you don't! It's no\npart of our refinery deal, it's mine, I've got it and it's hidden where\nnobody can find it till I sell it. Naturally, you don't like that.\"\n\n\"All _right_,\" said Hyrst. \"So the Titanite find is all yours. You're\nstill a partner in the refinery, remember. And you've still got an\nobligation to the rest of us, so you can damn well get in and do your\njob.\"\n\n\"Don't worry. I've always done my job.\"\n\n\"More or less,\" said Hyrst. \"For your information, I've seen better\nengineers in grade-school. There's Number Three hoist. It's been busted\nfor a week. Now let's get in there and fix it.\"\n\nThe two figures in Hyrst's memory toiled on, out of the area of roads to\nthe edge of the landing field, where the ships come to take away the\nrefined uranium. Number Three hoist rose in a stiff, ugly column from\nthe ground. It was supposed to fetch the uranium up from the\nunderground storage bins and load it into a specially-built hot-tank\nship in position at the dock. But Number Three had balked and refused to\nperform its task. In this completely automated plant, men were only\nimportant when something went wrong. Now something was wrong, and it was\nup to MacDonald, the mechanical engineer, and Hyrst, the electronics\nman, to set it right.\n\nHyrst opened the hatch, and they climbed the metal stairs to the upper\nchamber. Number Three's brain was here, its scanners, its tabulating and\nrecording apparatus, its signal system. A red light pulsated on a panel,\nalone in a string of white ones.\n\n\"Trouble's in the hoist-mechanism,\" said Hyrst. \"That's your\ndepartment.\" He smiled and sat down on a metal bench in the center of\nthe room, with his back to the stair. \"D Level.\"\n\nMacDonald grumbled, and went to a skeletal cage built over a round\nsegment of the floor. Various tools were clipped to the ribs of the\ncage. MacDonald pulled an extra rayproof protectall over his vac-suit\nand stepped inside the cage, pressing a button. The cage dropped, into a\ncircular shaft that paralleled the hoist right down to the feeder\nmechanism.\n\nHyrst waited. Inside his helmet he could hear MacDonald breathing and\ngrumbling as he worked away, repairing a break in the belt. He did not\nhear anything else. Then something happened, so swiftly that he had\nnever had any memory of it, and some time later he came to and looked\nfor MacDonald. The cage was way down at the bottom of the shaft and\nMacDonald was in it, with a very massive pedestal-block on top of him.\nThe block had been unbolted from the floor and dragged to the edge of\nthe shaft, and it could not possibly have been an accident that it\ntumbled in, between the wide-apart ribs of the cage.\n\nAnd that's how MacDonald died, Hyrst thought--and so _I_ died. They said\nI forced the secret of his Titanite find out of him, and then killed\nhim.\n\nShearing asked swiftly, \"MacDonald never gave you any hint of where he'd\nhidden the Titanite?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hyrst. He paused, and then said, \"It's the Titanite you're\nafter?\"\n\nShearing answered carefully. \"In a way, yes. But _we_ didn't kill\nMacDonald for it. Those who did kill him are the men who are after you\nnow. They're afraid you might lead us to the stuff.\"\n\nHyrst swore, shaking with sudden anger. \"Damn it, I won't be treated\nlike a child. Not by you, by anyone. I want--\"\n\n\"You want the men who killed MacDonald,\" said Shearing. \"I know. I\nremember what was in your mind when you met your son.\"\n\nA weakness took Hyrst and he leaned his forehead against the cold stone\nwall.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Shearing. \"But we want what you want--and more. So\nmuch more that you can't dream it. You must trust us.\"\n\n\"Us? That woman?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce again in Shearing's mind Hyrst saw the woman with her head against\nthe stars, and the ship looming darkly. He saw the woman much more\nclearly, and she was like a fire, burning with anger, burning with a\nsingle-minded, dedicated purpose. She was beautiful, and frightening.\n\n\"She, and others,\" said Shearing. \"Listen. We must go soon. We're to be\npicked up, secretly. Will you trust us--or would you rather trust\nyourself to those who are hunting you?\"\n\nHyrst was silent. Shearing said, \"Well?\"\n\n\"I'll go with you,\" said Hyrst.\n\nThey went out into the cold darkness, and Hyrst heard Shearing say in\nhis mind, \"I wouldn't try to run--\"\n\n_But it wasn't Shearing speaking in his mind now, it was a third man._\n\n\"I wouldn't try to run--\"\n\nFrantically startled, Hyrst threw out his mental vision and saw the men\nwho stood around them in the darkness, four men, three of them\nholding the wicked little weapons called bee-guns in their hands. The\nfourth man came closer, a dark slender man with a face like a fox,\nhigh-boned, narrow-eyed, smiling. It came to Hyrst that the three with\nweapons were only ordinary men, and that it was this fourth man whose\nmind had spoken.\n\nHe was speaking aloud now. \"I want you alive, believe me--but there are\nendless gradations between alive and dead. My men are very accurate.\"\n\nShearing's face was suddenly drawn and exhausted. \"Don't try anything,\"\nhe warned Hyrst wearily. \"He means it.\"\n\nThe dark man shook his head at Shearing. \"This wasn't nice of you. You\nknew we had a particular interest in Mr. Hyrst.\" He turned to Hyrst and\nsmiled. His teeth were small and very neat and white. \"Did you know that\nShearing has been keeping a shield over your mind as well as his? A\nlittle too large a task for him. When you jarred his mind open for an\ninstant, it was all we needed to lead us here.\"\n\nHe went on. \"Mr. Hyrst, my name is Vernon. We'd like you to come with\nus.\"\n\nVernon nodded to the three accurate men, and the whole little group\nbegan to walk in the direction of the spaceport. Shearing seemed almost\nasleep on his feet now. It was as though he had expended all his energy\non a task, and failed at it, and was now quiescent, like an empty well\nwaiting to fill again.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Hyrst asked, and Vernon answered:\n\n\"To see a gentleman you've never heard of, in a place you've never\nbeen.\" He added, with easy friendliness, \"Don't worry, Mr. Hyrst, we\nhave nothing against _you_. You're new to this--ah--state of life. You\nshouldn't be asked to make decisions or agreements until you know both\nsides of the question. Mr. Shearing was taking an unfair advantage.\"\n\nRemembering the dark hard purpose Shearing had let him see in his mind,\nHyrst could not readily dispute that. But he put out an exploring probe\nin the direction of Vernon's mind.\n\nIt was shut tight.\n\nThey walked on, toward the spaceport gates.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nAll space was before him, hung with the many-colored lights of the\nstars, intensely brilliant in the black nothing. It was incredibly\nsplendid, but it was too much like what he had looked at with his cold\nunseeing eyes for fifty years. He looked down--down being relative to\nwhere he was standing in the blister-window--and saw the whole Belt\nswarming by under him like a drift of fireflies. He quivered inwardly\nwith a chill vertigo, and turned away.\n\nVernon was talking aloud. He had been talking for some time. He was\nstretched out on a soft, deep lounge, smoking, pretending to sip from a\ntall glass.\n\n\"So you see, Mr. Hyrst, we can help you a lot. It's not easy for a\nLazarite--for one of us--to get a job. I know. People have a--well, a\n_feeling_. Now Mr. Bellaver--\"\n\n\"Where is Shearing?\" asked Hyrst. He came and stood in the center of the\nroom, with the soft lights in his eyes and the soft carpets under his\nfeet. His mind reached out, uneasy and restless, but it seemed to be\nsurrounded by a zone of fog that tangled and confused and deflected it.\nHe could not find Shearing.\n\n\"We've been here for hours,\" he said. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Probably talking a deal with Mr. Bellaver. I wouldn't worry. As I was\nsaying, Bellaver Incorporated is interested in men like you. We're the\nlargest builders of spacecraft in the System, and we can afford--\"\n\n\"I know all about it,\" said Hyrst impatiently. \"Old Quentin Bellaver\nwas busy swallowing up his rivals when I went through the door.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Vernon imperturbably, \"you should realize how much we can\ndo for you. Electronics is a vital branch--\"\n\nHyrst moved erratically around the room, looking at things and not\nreally seeing them, hearing Vernon's voice but not understanding what it\nsaid. He was growing more and more uneasy. It was as though someone was\ncalling to him, urgently, but just out of earshot. He kept straining,\nwith his ears and his mind, and Vernon's voice babbled on, and the\nbarrier was like a wall around his thoughts.\n\nThey had been aboard this ship for a long time now, and he had not seen\nShearing since they came through the hatch. It was not really a ship, of\ncourse. It had no power of its own, depending on powerful tugs to tow\nit. It was Walter Bellaver's floating pleasure-palace, and the damnedest\nthing Hyrst had ever seen. Vernon said it could and often did accommodate\nthree or four hundred guests in the utmost luxury. There was nobody\naboard it now but Bellaver, Vernon, Hyrst and Shearing, the three very\naccurate men, and perhaps a dozen others including stewards and the\ncrews of the tugs and Bellaver's yacht. It was named the _Happy Dream_,\nand it was presently drifting in an excessively lonely orbit high above\nthe ecliptic, between nothing and nowhere.\n\nVernon had been with him almost constantly. He was getting tired of\nVernon. Vernon talked too much.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"You can stop selling Bellaver. I'm not looking for a\njob. Where's Shearing?\"\n\n\"Oh, forget Shearing,\" said Vernon, impatient in his turn. \"You never\nheard of him until a few days ago.\"\n\n\"He helped me.\"\n\n\"For reasons of his own.\"\n\n\"What's _your_ reason? And Bellaver's?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bellaver is interested in all social problems. And I'm a Lazarite\nmyself, so naturally I have a sympathy for others like me.\" Vernon sat\nup, putting his glass aside on a low table. He had drunk hardly any of\nthe contents.\n\n\"Shearing,\" he said, \"is a member of a gang who some time ago stole a\nparticular property of Bellaver Incorporated. You're not involved in the\nquarrel, Mr. Hyrst. I'd advise you, as a friend, to stay not involved.\"\n\nHyrst's mind and his ears were stretched and quivering, straining to\nhear a cry for help just a little too far away.\n\n\"What kind of a property?\" asked Hyrst.\n\nVernon shrugged. \"The Bellavers have never said what kind, for fairly\nobvious reasons.\"\n\n\"Something to do with ships?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. It isn't important to me. Nor to you, Mr. Hyrst.\"\n\n\"Will you pour me a drink?\" said Hyrst, pointing to the cellaret close\nbeside Vernon. \"Yes, that's fine. How long ago?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Vernon, measuring whisky into a glass.\n\n\"The theft,\" said Hyrst, and threw his mind suddenly against the\nbarrier. For one fleeting second he forced a crack in it. \"Something\nover fifty--\", said Vernon, and let the glass fall. He spun around from\nthe cellaret and was halfway to his feet when Hyrst hit him. He hit him\nthree or four times before he would stay down, and three or four more\nbefore he would lie quiet. Hyrst straightened up, breathing hard. His\nlip was bleeding and he wiped it with the back of his hand. \"That was a\nlittle too big a job for _you_, Mr. Vernon,\" he said viciously. \"Trying\nto keep my mind blanked and under control for hours.\" He stuffed a\nhandkerchief into Vernon's mouth, and tied him up with his own\ncummerbund, and shoved him out of sight behind an enormous bed. Then he\nopened the door carefully, and went out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was nobody in the corridor. This was wide and ornate, with doors\nopening off it, and nothing to show what was behind them or which way to\ngo. Hyrst stood still a minute, getting control of himself. The barrier\nno longer obscured his mind. He let it rove, finding that every time he\ndid that it was easier, and the images clearer. He heard Shearing again,\nas he had heard him in that one second when Vernon's guard had faltered.\nHis face became set and ugly. He began to move toward the stern of the\n_Happy Dream_.\n\nHeavy metal-cloth curtains closed this end of the corridor. Beyond them\nwas a ballroom in which only one dim light now burned, a vastness of\nblack polished floors and crystal windows looking upon space. Hyrst's\nfootsteps were hushed and swallowed up in whispering echoes. He made his\nway across to another set of curtains, edged between them with infinite\ncaution, and found himself in the upper aisle of an amphitheater.\n\nIt was pitch dark where he was, and he stood perfectly still, exploring\nwith his mind. He could not see any guards. The rows of empty seats were\narranged in circles around a central pit, large enough for any\nentertainment Mr. Bellaver might decide to give. The pit was brilliantly\nlighted, and from somewhere lower down came the intermittent sound of\nvoices.\n\nAlso from the pit came Shearing's cries. Hyrst began to tremble with\noutrage and anger, and his still-uncertain mental control faltered\ndangerously. Then from out of nowhere, a voice spoke in his mind, and he\nsaw the face of the woman he had seen twice before, the woman Shearing\nserved.\n\n\"Careful,\" she said. \"There is a Lazarite with Bellaver. His attention\nis all on Shearing, but you must keep your mind shielded. I'll help\nyou.\"\n\nHyrst whispered. \"Thanks.\" He felt calm now, alert and capable. He crept\nalong the dark aisle, toward the pit.\n\nMr. Bellaver's theater lacked nothing. The large circular stage area was\nfitted with upper and lower electro-magnets for the use of acrobats and\ndancers with null-grav specialties. They could perform without\ndisturbing the regular grav-field of the _Happy Dream_, thus keeping the\nguests comfortable, and by skillful manipulation of the magnetic fields\nmore spectacular stunts were possible than in ordinary no-gravity.\n\nShearing was in the pit, between the upper and lower magnets. He wore an\nacrobat's metal attraction-harness, strapped on over his clothes. When\nHyrst looked over the rail he was hanging at the central point of\nweightlessness, where everything in a man floats free and his senses are\nlost in a dreadful vertigo unless he has been conditioned over a long\nperiod of time to get used to it. Shearing had not been conditioned.\n\n\"Careful,\" said the woman's warning voice in his mind. \"His life depends\non you. No, don't try to make contact with him! The Lazarite would sense\nyou--\"\n\nShearing began a slow ascension toward the upper magnet as the current\nwas increased, from some unseen control board. He moved convulsively\nturning horizontally around the axis of his own middle like a toy spun\non a string. His back was uppermost, and Hyrst could not see his face.\n\n\"Bellaver and the Lazarite,\" said the woman quietly, \"are trying to\nlearn from Shearing where our ship is. He has been able so far to keep\nhis mind shielded. He is--a very brave man. But you'll have to hurry.\nHe's near the breaking point.\"\n\nShearing was now almost level with Hyrst, suspended over that open pit,\nlooking down, a long way.\n\n\"You'll have to be quick, Hyrst. Please. Please get him out of there\nbefore we have to kill him.\"\n\nThe current in the magnet was cut and Shearing fell, with a long\nneighing scream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHyrst looked down. The repelling force of the lower magnet cushioned the\nfall, and the upper magnet took hold, hard. Shearing stopped about three\nfeet above the stage floor and started slowly to rise again. He seemed\nto be crying. Hyrst turned and ran back to the top of the aisle. Halfway\naround the circle he found steps and went tearing down them. On the next\nlevel--there were three--he saw two men leaning over the broad rail,\nwatching Shearing.\n\n\"Yes, there they are. You must find a weapon--\"\n\nHyrst looked around, blinking like a mole in the dark. Seats, nothing\nbut seats. Ornamentation, but all solid. Small metal cylinder, set in a\nwall niche. Chemical extinguisher. Yes. Compact and heavy. He took it.\n\n\"Hurry. He's almost through--\"\n\nThe two men were tense and hungry, eager as wolves. One was the\nLazarite, a grey man, old and seamed with living and none of it good.\nThe other was Bellaver, and he was young. He was tall and fresh-faced,\nimpeccably shaven, impeccably dressed, the keen, clean, public-spirited\nexecutive.\n\n\"I can give you more if you want it, Shearing,\" Bellaver said, his\nfingers ready on a control-plate set into the broad rail. \"How about\nit?\"\n\n\"Shut up, Bellaver,\" whispered the Lazarite aloud. \"I've almost got it.\nAlmost--\" His face was agonized with concentration.\n\n\"_Now!_\"\n\nThe woman's voiceless cry in his mind sent Hyrst forward. His hand swung\nup and then down in a crashing arc, elongated by the heavy cylinder. The\nLazarite fell without a sound. He fell across Bellaver, pushing him back\nfrom the control-plate, and lay over his feet, bleeding gently into the\nthick pile of the carpet. Bellaver's mouth and eyes opened wide. He\nlooked at the Lazarite and then at Hyrst. He leaped backward, away from\nthe encumbrance at his ankles, making the first hoarse effort at a shout\nfor help. Hyrst did not give him time to finish it. The first row of\nseats caught Bellaver and threw him, and Hyrst swung the cylinder again.\nBellaver collapsed.\n\n\"Was I in time?\" Hyrst asked of the woman, in his mind. He thought she\nwas crying when she answered, \"Yes.\" He smiled. He stepped over the\nLazarite and went to the control-plate and began to work with it until\nhe had Shearing safely on the floor of the stage. Then he cut the power\nand ran down another flight of steps to the bottom level. His mind was\nable to range free now. He could not sense anyone close at hand.\nBellaver seemed to have sent underlings elsewhere in the _Happy Dream_\nwhile he worked on Shearing. It was nothing for which a man would seek\nwitnesses. Hyrst vaulted the rail onto the stage and dragged Shearing\naway from the magnet. He felt uncomfortable in all that glare of light.\nHe hauled and grunted until he got Shearing over the rail into the dark.\nThen he wrestled the harness off him. Shearing sobbed feebly, and\nretched.\n\n\"Can you stand up?\" said Hyrst. \"Hey. Shearing.\" He shook him, hard.\n\"Stand up.\"\n\nHe got Shearing up, a one-hundred-and-ninety pound rag doll draped over\nhis shoulders. He began to walk him out of the theater. \"Are you still\nthere?\" he asked of the woman.\n\nThe answer came into his mind swiftly. \"Yes. I'll help you watch. Do you\nsee where the skiff is?\"\n\nIt was in a pod under the belly of the _Happy Dream_. \"I see it,\" said\nHyrst.\n\n\"Take that. Bellaver's yacht is faster, but you'd need the crew. The\nskiff you can handle yourself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe walked Shearing into a fore-and-aft corridor. Shearing's feet were\nbeginning to move of their own accord, and he had stopped retching. But\nhis eyes were still blank and he staggered aimlessly. Hyrst's nerves\nwere prickling with a mixture of fierce satisfaction and fear. Far above\nin the lush suite he felt Vernon stir and come to. There were men\nsomewhere closer, quite close. He forced his mind to see. Two of the\nvery accurate men who had been with Vernon were playing cards with two\nothers who were apparently stewards. The third one lolled in a chair,\nsmoking. All five were in a lounge just around the corner of a\ntransverse corridor. The door was open.\n\nWithout realizing that he had done so, Hyrst took control of Shearing's\nmind. \"Steady, now. We're going past that corner without a sound. You\nhear me, Shearing? Not a sound.\"\n\nShearing's eyes flickered vaguely. He frowned, and his step became\nsteadier. The floor of the corridor was covered in a tough resilient\nplastic that deadened footsteps. They passed the corner. The men\ncontinued to play cards. Hyrst sent up a derisive insult to Vernon and\ntold Shearing to hurry a little. The stair leading down into the pod was\njust ahead, ten yards, five--\n\nA man appeared in the corridor ahead, coming from some storeroom with a\nrack of plastic bottles in his hand.\n\n\"You'll have to run now,\" came the woman's thought, coolly. \"Don't\npanic. You can still make it.\"\n\nThe man with the bottles yelled. He began to run toward Hyrst and\nShearing, dropping the rack to leave his hands free. In the loungeroom\nbehind them the card-party broke up. Hyrst took Shearing by the arm and\nclamped down even tighter on his mind, giving him a single command. They\nran together, fast.\n\nThe men from the lounge poured out into the main corridor. Their voices\nwere confused and very loud. Ahead, the man who had been bringing the\nbottles was now between Hyrst and the stair. He was a brown, hard man\nwho looked like a pilot. He said, \"You better stop,\" and then he\ngrappled with Hyrst and Shearing. The three of them spun around in a\nclumsy dance, Shearing moving like an automaton. Hyrst and the pilot\nflailing away with their fists, and then the pilot fell back hard on the\nseat of his pants, with the blood bursting out of his nose and his eyes\nglazing. Hyrst raced for the stair, propelling Shearing. They tumbled\ndown it with a shot from a bee-gun buzzing over their heads. It was a\nshort stair with a double-hatch door at the bottom. They fell through\nit, and Hyrst slammed it shut almost on the toes of a man coming down\nthe stair behind them. The automatic lock took hold. Hyrst told\nShearing, \"You can stop now.\"\n\nA few minutes later, from the great swag belly of the _Happy Dream_, a\nsmall space-skiff shot away and was quickly lost in the star-shot\nimmensity above the Belt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nIt did not stay lost for long. Shearing was at the controls. The\nchronometer showed fourteen hours and twenty-seven minutes since they\nleft the _Happy Dream_. Shearing had spent eight of those hours in a\nspecies of comatose slumber, from which he had roused out practically\nnormal. Now Hyrst was heavily asleep in the pneumo-chair beside him.\n\nShearing punched him. \"Wake up.\"\n\nAfter several more punches Hyrst groaned and opened his eyes. He mumbled\na question, and Shearing pointed out the wide curved port that gave full\nvision forward and on both sides.\n\n\"It was a good try,\" he said, \"but I don't think we're going to make it.\nLook there. No, farther back. See it? Now the other side. And there's\none astern.\"\n\nStill sleepy, but alarmed, Hyrst swung his mental vision around. It was\neasier than looking. Two fast, powerful tugs from the _Happy Dream_, and\nBellaver's yacht. He frowned in heavy concentration. \"Bellaver's aboard.\nHe's got a mighty goose-egg on his head. Vernon too, with his shields up\ntight. The three accurate men and the pilot--his nose is a thing of\nbeauty--plus crew. Nine in all. Two men each to the tugs. The other\nLazarite, the one I laid out--he's not along.\"\n\nShearing nodded approvingly. \"You're getting good. Now take a glance at\nour fuel-tanks and tell me what you see.\"\n\nHyrst sat up straight, fully awake. \"Practically,\" he said, \"nothing.\"\n\n\"This skiff was meant for short hops only. We've got enough for perhaps\nanother forty-five minutes, less if we get too involved. They're faster\nthan we are, so they'll catch up to us--oh, say in about half an hour.\nWe have friends coming--\"\n\n\"Friends?\"\n\n\"Certainly. You don't think we let each other down, do you? Not the\nbrotherhood. But they had to come from a long way off. We can't possibly\nrendezvous under an hour and a half, maybe more if--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Hyrst. \"If we all get involved.\" He looked out the port.\nIn the beginning, following directions from the young woman--whose name\nhe had never thought to ask--he had set a course that plunged him deep\ninto one of the wildest sectors of the Belt. He was not a pilot. He\ncould, like most men of his time, handle a simple craft under simple\nconditions, but these conditions were not simple. The skiff's radar was\nshort-range and it had no automatic deflection reflexes. Hyrst had had\nto fly on ESP, spotting meteor swarms, asteroids, debris of all sorts in\nthis poetically named hell-hole, the Path of Minor Worlds, and then\nfiguring out how to get by, through, or over them without a crash.\nShearing had relieved him just in time.\n\nHe glowered at the whirling, glittering mess outside, the dust, the\nshards and fragments of a shattered world. It merged into mist and his\nmind was roving again. Shearing jockeyed the controls. He was flying\nesper too. The tugs and Bellaver's fast yacht were closing up the gap.\nThe level in the tanks went down, used up not in free fall but in the\nconstant maneuvering.\n\nHyrst swung mentally inboard to check vac-suits and equipment in the\nlocker, and then out again. His vision was strong and free. He could\nlook at the Sun, and see the splendid fires of the corona. He could look\nat Mars, old and cold and dried-up, and at Jupiter, massive and sullen\nand totally useless except as an anchor for its family of crazy moons.\nHe could look farther than that. He could look at the stars. In a little\nwhile, he thought, he could look at whole galaxies. His heart pounded\nand the breath came hot and hard into his lungs. It was a good feeling.\nIt made all that had gone before almost worthwhile. The primal\nimmensities drew him, the black gulfs lit with gold and crimson and\npeacock-colored flames. He wanted to go farther and farther, into--\n\n\"You're learning too fast,\" said Shearing dryly. \"Stick to something\nsmall and close and sordid, namely an asteroid where we can land.\"\n\n\"I found one,\" said Hyrst. \"There.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShearing followed his mental nudge. \"Hell,\" he said, \"couldn't you have\nspotted something better? These Valhallas give me the creeps.\"\n\n\"The others within reach are too small, or there's no cover. We'll have\nquite a little time to wait. I take it you would like to be alive when\nyour friends come.\"\n\nVernon's thought broke in on them abruptly. \"You have just one chance of\nthat, and that's to give yourselves up, right now.\"\n\n\"Does the socially-conscious Mr. Bellaver still want to give me that\njob?\" asked Hyrst.\n\n\"I'm warning you,\" said Vernon.\n\n\"Your mind is full of hate,\" said Hyrst. \"Cleanse it.\" He shut Vernon\nout as easily as hanging up a phone. Under stress, his new powers were\ndeveloping rapidly. He felt a little drunk with them. Shearing said,\n\"Don't get above yourself, boy. You're still a cub, you know.\" Then he\ngrinned briefly and added, \"By the way, thanks.\"\n\nHyrst said, \"I owed it to you. And you can thank your lady friend, too.\nShe had a big hand in it.\"\n\n\"Christina,\" said Shearing softly. \"Yes.\"\n\nHe dropped the skiff sharply in a descending curve, toward the asteroid.\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Hyrst, \"you could now tell me what the devil this\nis all about?\"\n\nShearing said, \"We've got a starship.\"\n\nHyrst stared. For a long time he didn't say anything. Then, \"You've got\na starship? But nobody has! People talk of someday reaching other stars,\nbut nobody tried yet, nobody _could_ try--\" He broke off, suddenly\nremembering a dark, lonely ship, and a woman with angry eyes watching\nit. Even in his astonishment, things began to come clearer to him. \"So\nthat's it--a starship. And Bellaver wants it?\"\n\nShearing nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" said Hyrst. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"You've already developed some amazing mental capabilities since you\ncame back from beyond the door. You'll find that's only the beginning.\nThe radiation, the exposure--something. The simple act of pseudo-death,\nperhaps. Anyway, the brain is altered, stepped up, a great deal of its\nnormally unused potential released. You've always been a\nfair-to-middling technician. You'll find your rating boosted,\neventually, to the genius level.\"\n\nThe skiff veered wildly as Shearing dodged a whizzing chunk of rock the\nsize of a skyscraper.\n\n\"That's one reason,\" he said, \"why we wanted to get you before Bellaver\ndid. The number of technicians undergoing the Humane Penalty is quite\nsmall. We--the brotherhood--need all of them we can get.\"\n\n\"But that wasn't the main reason you wanted me?\" pressed Hyrst.\n\nShearing looked at him. \"No. We wanted you mainly because you were\npresent when MacDonald died. Handled right--\"\n\nHe paused. The asteroid was rushing at them, and Bellaver's ships were\nclose behind. Hyrst was already in a vac-suit, all but the helmet.\n\n\"Take the controls,\" said Shearing. \"As she goes. Don't worry, I'll make\nthe landing.\" He pulled the vac-suit on. \"Handled right,\" he said, \"you\nmight be the key to that murder, and to the mystery behind it that the\nbrotherhood _must_ solve.\"\n\nHe took the controls again. They helped each other on with their\nhelmets. The asteroid filled the port, a wild, weird jumble of\nvari-colored rock.\n\n\"I don't see how,\" said Hyrst, into his helmet mike.\n\n\"Latent impressions,\" answered Shearing briefly, and sent the skiff\nskittering in between two great black monoliths, to settle with a jar on\na pan of rock as smooth and naked as a ballroom floor.\n\n\"Make it fast,\" said Shearing. \"They're right on top of us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe skiff, designed as Sheering had said for short hops, could not\naccommodate the extra weight and bulk of an airlock. You were supposed\nto land in atmosphere. If you didn't, you just pushed a release-button\nand hung on. The air was exhausted in one whistling swoosh that took\nwith it everything loose. The moisture in it crystallized instantly, and\nbefore this frozen drift had even begun to settle, Hyrst and Shearing\nwere on their way.\n\nThey crossed the rock pan in great swaggering bounds. The gravity was\nlight, the horizon only twenty or so miles away. Literally in his mind's\neye Hyrst could see the three ships arrowing at them. He opened contact\nwith Vernon, knowing Shearing had done so too. Vernon had been looking\nfor them.\n\n\"Mr. Bellaver still prefers to have you alive,\" he said. \"If you'll wait\nquietly beside the skiff, we'll take you aboard.\"\n\nShearing gave him a hard answer.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Vernon. \"Mr. Bellaver wants me to make it clear to you\nthat he doesn't intend for you to get away. So you can interpret that as\nyou please. Be seeing you.\"\n\nHe broke contact, knowing that Hyrst and Shearing would close him out.\nFrom now on, Hyrst realized, he would keep track of them the way he and\nShearing had kept track of obstructions in the path of flight, by mental\n\"sight\". The yacht was extremely close. Suddenly Hyrst had a confused\nglimpse of a hand on a control-lever over-lapped by a view of the\nblack-mouthed tubes of the yacht's belly-jets. He dived, literally, into\na crack between one of the monoliths and a slab that leaned against its\nbase, dragging Shearing with him.\n\nThe yacht swept over. Nothing happened. It dropped out of sight, braking\nfor a landing.\n\n\"Imagination,\" said Shearing. \"You realize a possibility, and you think\nit's so. Tricky. But I don't blame you. The safe side is the best one.\"\n\nHyrst looked out the crack. One of the tugs was coming in to land beside\nthe skiff, while the other one circled.\n\n\"Now what?\" he said. \"I suppose we can dodge them for a while, but we\ncan't hide from Vernon.\"\n\nShearing chuckled. He had got his look of tough competence back. He\nseemed almost to be enjoying himself. \"I told you you were only a cub.\nHow do you suppose we've kept the starship hidden all these years?\nWatch.\"\n\nIn the flick of a second Hyrst went blind and deaf. Then he realized\nthat it was only his mental eyes and ears that were blanked out as\nthough a curtain had been drawn across them. His physical eyes were\nstill clear and sharp, and when Shearing's voice came over the helmet\naudio he heard it without trouble.\n\n\"This is called the cloak. I suppose you could call it an extension of\nthe shield, though it's more like a force field. It's no bar to physical\nvision, and it has the one great disadvantage of being opaque both ways\nto mental energy. But it does act as a deflector. If Vernon follows us\nnow, he'll have to do it the hard way. Stick close by me, so I don't\nhave too wide a spread. And it'll be up to you to lead. I can't do both.\nLet's go.\"\n\nHyrst had, unconsciously, become so used to his new perceptions that it\nmade him feel dull and helpless to be without them. He led off down one\nof the smooth rock avenues, going away from the skiff and the tug which\nhad just landed.\n\nOn either side of the avenue were monoliths, irregularly spaced and of\ndifferent sizes and heights but following an apparently orderly plan.\nThe light of the distant sun lay raw and blinding on them, casting\nshadows as black and sharp-edged as though drawn upon the rock with\nindia ink.\n\nYou could see faces in the monoliths. You could see mighty outlines,\nsingly and in groups, of gods and beasts and men, in combat, in\nsuppliance, in death and burial. That was why these asteroids were\ncalled Valhallas. Twenty-six of them had been found so far, and studied,\nand still no one could say certainly whether or not the hands of any\nliving beings had fashioned them. They might be actual monuments,\ndefaced by cosmic dust, by collision with the myriad fragments of the\nBelt, by time. They might be one of Nature's casual jokes, created by\nthe same agencies. No actual tombs had been found, nor tools, nor\ndefinitely identifiable artifacts. But still the feeling persisted, in\nthe airless silence of the avenues, that some passing race had paused\nand wrought for itself a memorial more enduring than its fame, and then\ngone on into the great galactic sea, never to return.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHyrst had never been on a Valhalla before. He understood why Shearing\nhad not wanted to land and he wished now that they hadn't. There was\nsomething overwhelmingly sad and awesome about these leaning, towering\nfigures of stone, moving forever in their lonely orbit, going nowhere,\nreturning to nowhere.\n\nThen he saw the second tug overhead. He forgot his daydreams. \"They're\ngoing to act as a spotter,\" he said. Shearing grunted but did not speak.\nHis whole mind was concentrated on maintaining the cloak. Hyrst stopped\nhim still in the pitchy shadow under what might have been a kneeling\nwoman sixty feet high. He watched the tug. It lazed away, circling\nslowly, and he did not think it had seen them. He could not any longer\nsee the place where they had landed, but he assumed that by now the\nyacht had looped back and come in--if not there somewhere close by. They\ncould figure on nine to eleven men hunting them, depending on whether\nthey left the ships guarded or not. Either way, it was too many.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said aloud to Shearing. \"Listen, I want to ask you. What\nyou said about latent impressions--you think I might have seen and heard\nthe killer even though I was unconscious?\"\n\n\"Especially heard. Possible. With your increased power, and ours,\nimpressions received through sense-channels but not recognized at the\ntime or remembered later might be recovered.\" He shook his head. \"Don't\nbother me.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to know,\" said Hyrst. He thought of his son, and the two\ndaughters he hoped he would never see. He thought of Elena. It was too\nlate to do anything for her, but the others were still living. So was\nhe, and he intended to stay that way, at least until he had done what he\nset out to do.\n\n\"Old Bellaver was behind that killing, wasn't he? Old Quentin, this\none's grandfather.\"\n\n\"Yes. Don't bother me.\"\n\n\"One thing more. Do we Lazarites live longer than men?\"\n\nShearing gave him a curious, brief look. \"Yes.\"\n\nThe tug was out of sight behind a massive rearing shape that seemed to\nclutch a broken ship between its paws. Symbolic, perhaps, of space? Who\nknew? Hyrst led Shearing in wild impala-like leaps across an open space,\nand into a narrow way that twisted, filled with darkness, among the\nbases of a group that resembled an outlandish procession following a\nking.\n\n\"How much longer?\"\n\n\"Humane Penalty first came in a hundred and fourteen years ago, right?\nAfter Seitz' method was perfected for saving spacemen. I was one of the\nfirst they used it on.\"\n\n\"My God,\" said Hyrst. Yet, somehow, he was not as surprised as he might\nhave been.\n\n\"I've aged,\" said Shearing apologetically. \"I was only twenty-seven\nthen.\"\n\nThey crouched, beside a humped shape like a gigantic lizard with a long\ntail. The tug swung overhead and slowly on.\n\nHyrst said, \"Then it's possible the one who killed MacDonald is still\nalive?\"\n\n\"Possible. Probable.\"\n\nHyrst bared his teeth, in what was not at all like a smile. \"Good,\" he\nsaid. \"That makes me happy.\"\n\nThey did not do any talking after that. They had had their helmet radios\noperating on practically no power at all, so that they couldn't be\npicked up outside a radius of a few yards, but even that might be too\nclose, now that Bellaver's men had had time to get suited and fan out.\nThey shut them off entirely, communicating by yanks and nudges.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor what seemed to Hyrst like a very long time, but which was probably\nless than half an hour in measured minutes, they dodged from one patch\nof shadow to another, following an erratic course that Hyrst thought\nwould lead them away from the ships. Once more the tug went over, slow,\nand then Hyrst didn't see it again. The idea that they might have given\nup occurred to him but he dismissed it as absurd. With the helmet mike\nshut off, the silence was beginning to get on his nerves. Once he looked\nup and saw a piece of cosmic debris smash into a monolith. Dust and\nsplinters flew, and a great fragment broke off and fell slowly downward,\nbumping and rebounding, and all of it as soundless as a dream. You\ncouldn't hear yourself walk, you couldn't hear anything but the roar of\nyour own breathing and the pounding of your own blood. The grotesque\nrocky avenues could hide an army, stealthy, creeping--\n\nThere was a hill, or at least a higher eminence, crowned with what might\nhave been the cyclopean image of a man stretched out on a noble\ncatafalque, with hooded giants standing by in attitudes of mourning. It\nseemed like the best place to stop that Hyrst had seen, with plenty of\ncover and a view of the surrounding area. With luck, you might stay\nhidden there a long time. He jogged Shearing's elbow and pointed, and\nShearing nodded. There was a wide, almost circular sweep of open rock\naround the base of the hill. Hyrst looked carefully for the tug. There\nwas no sign of it. He tore out across the open, with Shearing at his\nheels.\n\nThe tug swooped over, going fast this time. It could not possibly have\nmissed them. Shearing dropped the cloak with a grunt. \"No use for that\nany more,\" he said. They bounded up the hillside and in among the\nmourning figures. The tug whipped around in a tight spiral and hung over\nthe hill. Hyrst shook the sweat out of his eyes. His mind was clear\nagain. The tug's skipper was babbling into his communicator, and in\nanother place on the asteroid Hyrst could mentally see a thin skirmish\nline spread out, and in still another four men in a bunch. They all\npicked up and began to move, toward the hill.\n\nShearing said, nodding spaceward, \"Our friends are on the way. If we can\nhold out--\"\n\n\"Fat chance,\" said Hyrst. \"They're armed, and all we've got is\nflare-pistols.\" But he looked around. His eyes detected nothing but\nrock, hard sunlight, and deep shadow, but his mind saw that one of the\nblack blots at the base of the main block, the catafalque, was more than\na shadow. He slid into a crack that resembled a passage, being rounded\nrather than ragged. Shearing was right behind him. \"I don't like this,\"\nhe said, \"but I suppose there's no help for it.\"\n\nThe crack led down into a cave, or chamber, too irregularly shaped to be\nartificial, too smoothly surfaced and floored to be natural. There was\nnothing in it but a block of stone, nine feet or so long and about four\nfeet wide by five feet high. It seemed to be a natural part of the\nfloor, but Hyrst avoided it. On the opposite, the sunward side, there\nwas a small windowlike aperture that admitted a ray of blinding\nradiance, sharply defined and doing nothing to illumine the dark on\neither side of it.\n\nVernon's thought came to them, hard, triumphant, peremptory. \"Mr.\nBellaver says you have ten minutes to come out. After that, no mercy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nThe minutes slid past, sections of eternity arbitrarily measured by the\nstandards of another planet and having no relevance at all on this tiny\nwhirling rock. The beam of light from the small aperture moved visibly\nacross the opposite wall. Hyrst watched it, blinking. Outside,\nBellaver's men were drawn up in a wide crescent across the hill in front\nof the catafalque. They waited.\n\n\"No mercy,\" said Hyrst softly. \"No mercy, is it?\" He bent over and began\nto loosen the clamps that held the lead weights to the soles of his\nboots.\n\n\"It isn't mercy we need,\" said Shearing. \"It's time.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Look for yourself.\"\n\nHyrst shifted his attention to space. There was a ship in it, heading\ntoward the asteroid, and coming fast. Hyrst frowned, doing in his head\nwithout thinking about it a calculation that would have required a\ncomputer in his former life.\n\n\"Twenty-three minutes and seventeen seconds,\" he said, \"inclusive of the\nfour remaining.\"\n\nHe finished getting the weights off his boots. He handed one to\nShearing. Then he half-climbed, half-floated up the wall and settled\nhimself above the entrance, where there was a slight concavity in the\nrock to give him hold.\n\n\"Shearing,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" He was settling himself beside the mouth of the crack, where a\nman would have to come clear inside to get a shot at him.\n\n\"A starship implies the intention to go to the stars. Why haven't you?\"\n\n\"For the simplest reason in the world,\" said Shearing bitterly. \"The\ndamn thing can't fly.\"\n\n\"But--\" said Hyrst, in astonishment.\n\n\"It isn't finished. It's been building for over seventy years now, and a\nlong and painful process that's been, too, Hyrst--doing it bit by bit in\nsecret, and every bit having to be dreamed up out of whole cloth, and\noften discarded and dreamed up again, because the principle of a\nworkable star-drive has never been formulated before. And it still isn't\nfinished. It can't be finished, unless--\"\n\nHe stopped, and both men turned their attention to the outside.\n\n\"Bellaver's looking at his chrono,\" said Hyrst. \"Go ahead, we've got a\nminute.\"\n\nShearing continued, \"unless we can get hold of enough Titanite to build\nthe hyper-shift relays. Nothing else has a fast enough reaction time,\nand the necessary load-capacity. We must have burned out a thousand\ndifferent test-boards, trying.\"\n\n\"Can't you buy it?\" asked Hyrst. The question sounded reasonable, but he\nknew as he said it that it was a foolish one. \"I mean, I know the stuff\nis scarcer than virtue and worth astronomical sums--that's what\nMacDonald was so happy about--but--\"\n\n\"The Bellaver Corporation had a corner on the stuff before our ship was\neven thought of. That's what brought this whole damned mess about. Some\nof our people--not saying why they wanted it, of course--tried to buy\nsome from Bellaver in the usual way, and one of them must have been\nincautious about his shield. Because a Lazarite working for Bellaver\ncaught a mental hint of the starship, and the reason for the Titanite,\nand that was it. Three generations of Bellavers have been after us for\nthe star-drive, and it's developed into a secret war as bitter as any\never fought on the battlefield. They hold all the Titanite, we hold the\nship, and perhaps now you're beginning to see why MacDonald was killed,\nand why you're so important to both sides.\"\n\n\"Beginning to,\" said Hyrst. \"But only beginning.\"\n\n\"MacDonald found a Titanite pocket. And as you know, a Titanite pocket\nisn't very big. One man can break the crude stuff, fill a sack with it,\nand tote it on his own back if he doesn't have a power-sled.\"\n\n\"MacDonald had a sled.\"\n\n\"And he used it. He cleaned out his pocket, afraid somebody else would\ntrack him to it, and he hid the wretched ore somewhere. Then he began to\ndicker. He approached the Bellaver Corporation, and we heard of it and\napproached _him_. He tried playing us off against Bellaver to boost the\nprice, and suddenly he was dead and you were accused of his murder. We\nthought you really had done it, because no Titanite turned up, and we\nknew Bellaver hadn't gotten it from him. We'd watched too closely. It\nwasn't until some years later that one of our people learned that\nMacDonald had threatened a little too loudly to sell to us unless\nBellaver practically tripled his offer--and of course Bellaver didn't\ndare do that. A price so much out of line even for Titanite would have\nstirred all the rival shipbuilders to unwelcome curiosity. So, we\nfigured, Bellaver had had him killed.\"\n\n\"But what happened to the Titanite?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Shearing, \"is what nobody knows. Bellaver must have figured\nthat if his tame Lazarites couldn't find where MacDonald had put it, we\ncouldn't either. He was right. With all our combined mental probes and\nconventional detectors we haven't been able to track it down. And we\nhaven't been able to find any more pockets, either. Bellaver Corporation\ngot exclusive mineral rights to the whole damned moon. They even own the\nrefinery now.\"\n\nHyrst shook his head. \"Latent impressions or not, I don't see how I can\nhelp on that. If MacDonald had given the killer any clue--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA beam of bright blue light no thicker than a pencil struck in through\nthe mouth of the passage. It touched the side of the large stone block.\nThe stone turned molten and ran, and then the beam flicked off, leaving\na place that glowed briefly red. Shearing said, \"I guess our ten minutes\nare up.\"\n\nThey were. For a second or two nothing more happened and then Hyrst saw\nsomething come sailing in through the crack. His mind told him what it\nwas just barely in time to shut his eyes. There was a flash that dazzled\nhim even through his closed lids, and the flash became a glare that did\nnot lessen. Bellaver's men had tossed in a long-term flare, and almost\nat once someone followed it, in the hope of catching Hyrst and Shearing\nblinded and off guard. The eyes of Hyrst's mind, unaffected by light,\nclearly showed him the suited figure just below him, with its bubble\nhelmet covered by a glare-shield. They directed him with perfect\naccuracy in the downward sweep of the lead weight he had taken from his\nboot, and which he still held in his hand. The bubble helmet was very\nstrong, and the gravity very light, but the concussion was enough to\ndrop the man unconscious. Just about thought Hyrst, what happened to me\nthere in the hoist tower, when MacDonald died. Shearing, who had by now\nadjusted his own glare-shield stooped quickly and took the man's gun.\n\nHe said aloud, over the helmet communicator, \"The next one that steps\nthrough here gets it. Do you hear that, Bellaver?\"\n\nBellaver's voice answered. \"Listen, Shearing, I was wrong. I admit it.\nLet's calm down and start over again. I--\"\n\n\"Ten minutes ago it was no mercy.\"\n\n\"It's hard for me to behave reasonably about this business. You know\nwhat it means to me, what it meant to my father and _his_ father. But\nI'm willing to do anything, Shearing, if you'll make a deal.\"\n\n\"I'll make a deal. Readily. Eagerly. Give back what your grandfather\nstole from us, and we'll call it square.\"\n\n\"Oh no we won't,\" said Hyrst grimly, breaking in. \"Not until I find who\nkilled MacDonald.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Bellaver. \"Wilson, break out the grenades.\"\n\nThe entire surface of Hyrst's body burst into a flaring sweat. For one\npanic-stricken second he wanted to rush out the crack pleading for\nmercy. Then he got his feet against the wall and pushed hard, and went\nplunging across the chamber in a sort of floating dive. Shearing got\nthere at the same time and helped to pull him down. They huddled\ntogether on the floor, with the coffin-shaped block between them and the\ncrack. Hyrst sent out a frantic mental call to hurry, directed at the\nspaceship of the brotherhood.\n\n\"They're all going to hurry,\" said Shearing. \"Vernon has found the ship\nnow. He's telling Bellaver. Here comes the grenade--\"\n\nSmall round glittering thing of death, curving light and graceful\nthrough the airless gloom. It comes so slowly, and the flesh shrinks\nquivering upon itself until it is nothing more than a handful of simple\nfear. Outside the men are running away, and the one who has thrown the\ngrenade from the cramped, constructing vantage of the crack is running\nafter them, and Shearing is crying with his mind Will it to fall short,\n_will it to fall sh_--\n\nThere is a great brilliance, and the rock leaps, but there is not the\nslightest sound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\n    \"_The Ram, the Bull, the Heavenly Twins,\n    And next the Crab the Lion Shine.\n    The Virgin and the Scales--_\"\n\nThe old zodiacal rhyme was running through Hyrst's mind, and that was\nthe only thing that was in his mind.\n\nThe Virgin and the Scales.\n\nYes. And she's very beautiful, too, thought Hyrst. But she shouldn't be\n_holding_ the Scales. That's all wrong. The Scales come next, and then\nthe Scorpion--Scorpio--and the Archer--Sagittarius--\n\nAnd anyway they aren't scales, they're a pair of big golden stars, and\nshe's putting them down, and they're melting together. There's only one\nof them, and it's not a star at all, really. It's a polished metal jug,\nreflecting the light, and--\n\nThe Virgin smiled. \"The doctor said you were coming around. I brought\nyou something to drink.\"\n\nReality returned to Hyrst with a rush. \"You're Christina,\" he said, and\ntried to sit up. He was dizzy, and she helped him, and he said, \"I guess\nit did fall short.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The grenade. The last thing I remember is Shearing--Wait. Where is\nShearing?\"\n\n\"Sitting up in the lounge, nursing his bruises. Yes, it fell short, but\nI don't think telekinetics had much to do with that. We've never been\nable to control matter convincingly. There. All right?\"\n\n\"Fine. How did you get us out?\"\n\n\"Of course the grenade had made the entrance impassible--we had to cut\nour way in through the outer wall. We had a clear field. Bellaver's men\nhad all gone back to their ships. They thought you were dead, and to\ntell you the truth we thought you must be, too. But you didn't quite\n'feel' dead, so we dug you out.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Hyrst. \"I suppose they know different now.\"\n\nHe was in a ship's sick-bay. From the erratic crash and shudder of the\nlateral jets, they were beating their way through the Belt, and at a\nhigh rate of speed. Hyrst sent a glance back into space. The tugs and\nBellaver's yacht were following, but this time only the yacht had a\nchance. The tugs were dropping hopelessly behind.\n\n\"Yes, they soon found out once we got you out, but with any luck we'll\nlose them,\" said Christina. She sat down beside the bunk, where she\ncould see his face. \"Shearing told you about the ship.\"\n\n\"The starship. Yes.\" He looked at her. Suddenly he laughed. \"You're not\na goddess at all.\"\n\n\"Who said I was?\"\n\n\"Shearing. Or anyway, his mind. Ten feet tall, and crowned with stars--I\nwas afraid of you.\" He leaned closer. \"Your eyes, though. They are\nangry.\"\n\n\"So will yours be,\" she said, \"when you've fought the Bellavers as long\nas we have.\"\n\n\"There are still things I don't understand. Why you built the ship, why\nyou've kept it secret from everyone, not just Bellaver, what you plan to\ndo with it--how _you_ came to be one of the Brotherhood.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"The Seitz method was originated to save wreck-victims\nfrozen in deep space. Remember? Quite a few of us never went through the\ndoor at all, innocent or guilty. But that makes no difference, once\nyou've come back from out there.\" She put her hand on his. \"You've\nlearned fast, but you're only on the threshold. There's no need for\nwords with us. Open your mind--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe did so. At first it was no different from the contact he had had with\nShearing's mind, or with Christina's before on the _Happy Dream_.\nThoughts came to him clearly phrased--_You want to know why we built the\nship, what we plan to do with it_--and it was only after some time that\nhe realized the words had stopped and he was receiving Christina's\nemotions, her memories and opinions, her disappointments and her dreams,\nas simply and directly as though they were his own.\n\nYou haven't had time yet, they told him without words, to realize how\nalone you are. You haven't tried, as most of us do at first, to be human\nagain, to fit yourself into life as though the gap of time was not\nthere, as though nothing had changed. You haven't watched people getting\nold around you while you have hardly added a gray hair. You haven't had\nto move from one place to another, one job, one group of friends to\nanother, because sooner or later they sense something wrong about you.\nYou haven't had to hide your new powers as you would hide a disease\nbecause people would fear and hate you, perhaps even kill you, if they\nknew. That's why there is a brotherhood. And that's why we built the\nship.\n\nSymbol of flight. Symbol of freedom. A universe wide beyond imagining,\nthronging with many colored guns, with new worlds where men in a human\nsociety could build a society of their own. _No boundaries beyond which\nthe mind cannot dare to go. All space, all time, all knowledge--free!_\n\nOnce more he saw those wide dark seas between the suns. His mind raced\nwith hers through the cold-flaming nebulae, wheeled blinded and stunned\npast the hiving stars of Hercules, looked in eager fascination at the\nsplendid spiral of Andromeda--no longer, perhaps, beyond reach, for what\nare time and space to the intangible forces of the mind?\n\nThen that wild flight ceased, and instead there was a smaller vision,\nmisty and only half realized, of houses and streets, a place where they\ncould live and be what they were, openly and without fear.\n\n_Can you understand now_, she asked him, _what they would think if they\nknew about the ship? Can you understand that they would be afraid to\nhave us colonizing out there, afraid of what we might do?_\n\nHe understood. At the very least, if the truth were known, the Lazarites\nwould never be free again. They would be taken and tested and examined\nand lectured about, legislated over, restricted, governed, and used.\nThey might be fairly paid for their ship and whatever other advancements\nthey might develop, but they would never be permitted to use them.\n\nWith sudden savage eagerness Hyrst said, \"But first of all I must know\nwho killed MacDonald. Shearing explained about the latent impressions.\nI'm ready.\"\n\nShe stood up, regarding him with grave eyes. \"There's no guarantee it\nwill work. Sometimes it does. Sometimes not.\"\n\nHyrst thought about the tired, gray-haired man who had stood at the foot\nof his bed. \"It'll work. It's got to.\"\n\nHe added, \"If it doesn't, I'll tear the truth out of Bellaver with my\nhands.\"\n\n\"It may come to that,\" she said grimly. \"But we'll hope. Lie quiet. I'll\nmake the arrangements.\"\n\nAn hour later Hyrst lay on the padded table in the middle of the\nsick-bay. The ship spun and whirled and leaped in a sort of insane\ndance, and Hyrst was strapped to the table to prevent his being thrown\noff. He had known that the ship was maneuvering in the thickest swarm\narea of the Belt with four pilots mind-linked and flying esper, trying\nto out-dare Bellaver. Two others were keeping Vernon blanked, and they\nhoped that either Bellaver himself or his radar-deflector system would\ngive up. Hyrst had known this, but now he was no longer interested. He\nwas barely conscious of the lurching of the ship. They had given him\nsome sort of a drug, and he lay relaxed and pliant in a pleasant\nsuspension of all worries, looking vaguely up at the faces that were\nbent over him. Finally he closed his eyes, and even they were gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was crossing the plain of methane snow with MacDonald, under the\nglowing Rings. At first it was all a little blurred, but gradually the\nmemory cleared until he was aware of each tiny detail far more clearly\nthan he had been at the time--the texture of the material from which\nMacDonald's suit was made, the infinitesimal shadow underscoring every\nroughness of the snow, the exact sensation of walking in his leaded\nboots, the whisper and whistle of his oxygen system. He quarreled again\nwith MacDonald, not missing a word. He climbed with him into the tower\nof Number Three hoist and examined the signal lights, and sat down on\nthe bench, smiling, to wait.\n\nHe sweated inside his suit. He would take a shower when he got back to\nquarters. He wished for a smoke. MacDonald's steady grumbling and\ncursing filled his helmet. He listened, enjoying it. Hope you bang\nyourself with your own clumsy hammer. And I wish you joy of your\nfortune. If you have as many friends rich as you had poor you won't have\nany. There was an itch under his left arm. He pressed the suit in with\nhis right and wriggled his body against it. It didn't do any good. Damn\nsuits. Damn Titan. Lucky Elena, back on Earth with the kids. Making good\nmoney, though. Won't be long before I can go back and live like a human\nbeing. Now his nose itched, and MacDonald was still grumbling. There was\nthe faintest ghost of a sound and then _crack_, then nothing, dark,\ncold, sinking, very weak, gone. Nothing, nothing. I come to in the cold\nsilence and look down the shaft at MacDonald and he is dead.\n\n_Go back a bit. Slow. That's right. Easy. Back to Elena and the kids._\n\nLucky Elena, in the sun and the warm sweet air. Lucky kids. But I'm\nlucky too. I can go back to them soon. My nose itches. Why does your\nnose always itch when you've got a helmet on, or your hands all over\ngrease? Listen to MacDonald, damning the belt, damning the tools,\ndamning everything in sight. Is that a footstep? The air is thin and\npoisonous, but it carries sound. Somebody coming behind me? Split\nsecond, no time to look or think. _Crack._ Cold. Dark. Nothing.\n\n_Let's go back again. Don't hurry. We've all the time in the world. Go\nback to the footsteps you heard behind you._\n\nAlmost heard. And then I black and cold. Heavy. Flat. Face heavy against\nhelmet, cold. Lying down. Must get up, must get up, danger. Far away.\nCan't. MacDonald is screaming. Let the lift alone, what are you doing,\nHyrst? Hyrst! Shut up, you greedy little man, and listen. You're not\nHyrst--who are you? That doesn't matter. I know, you're from Bellaver.\nBellaver sent you to steal the Titanite. Well, you won't get it. It's\nwhere nobody will ever get it unless I show them how. Good. That's good,\nMacDonald. That's what I wanted to know. You see, _we_ don't need the\nTitanite.\n\nMacDonald screams again and the lift goes down with a roar and a rattle\nof severed chain.\n\nHeavy footsteps, shaking the floor by my head. Someone turns me over,\nspeaks to me, bending close. Light is gray and strange. I try to rouse.\nI can't. The man is satisfied. He drops me and goes away, but I have\nseen his face inside his helmet. I hear him working on some metal thing\nwith a tool. He is whistling a little under his breath. MacDonald is not\nscreaming now. From time to time he whimpers. But I have seen the\nkiller's face.\n\nI have seen his face.\n\nI have seen--\n\n_Take it easy, Hyrst. Take your time._\n\nElena is dead, and this is Christina bending over me.\n\nI have seen the killer's face.\n\nIt is the face of Vernon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThere was Christina, and there was Shearing, and there were two more he\ndid not know, leaning over him. The drug was wearing off a little, and\nHyrst could see them more clearly, see the bitter disappointment in\ntheir eyes.\n\n\"Is that all?\" Christina said. \"Are you sure? Go back again--\"\n\nThey took him back again, and it was the same.\n\n\"That's all MacDonald said? Then we're no closer to the Titanite than we\nwere before.\"\n\nHyrst was not interested in the Titanite. \"Vernon,\" he said. Something\nred and wild rose up in him, and he tried to tear away the straps that\nheld him. \"Vernon. I'll get him--\"\n\n\"Later, Hyrst,\" said Shearing, and sighed. \"Lie still a bit. He's on\nBellaver's yacht, remember? Quite out of reach. Now think. MacDonald\nsaid, You won't get it, it's where nobody will ever get it--\"\n\n\"What's the use?\" said Christina, turning away. \"It was a faint hope\nanyway. Dying men don't draw obliging maps for you.\" She sat down on the\nedge of a bunk and put her head in her hands. \"We might as well give up.\nYou know that.\"\n\nOne of the two Lazarites who had done the latent probe on Hyrst said\nwith hollow hopefulness, \"Perhaps if we let him rest a while and then go\nover it again--\"\n\n\"Let me up out of here,\" said Hyrst, still groggy with the drug. \"I want\nVernon.\"\n\n\"I'll help you get him,\" said Shearing, \"if you'll tell me what\nMacDonald meant when he said _nobody will ever get it unless I show them\nhow_.\"\n\n\"How the devil do I know?\" Hyrst tugged at the straps, raging. \"Let me\nup.\"\n\n\"But you knew MacDonald well. You worked with him and beside him for\nyears.\"\n\n\"Does that tell me where he hid the Titanite? Don't be an ass, Shearing.\nLet me up.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Shearing equably, \"he didn't say _where_. He said _how_.\"\n\n\"Isn't that the same thing?\"\n\n\"Is it? Listen. Nobody will ever get it unless I show them where. Nobody\nwill ever get it unless I show them how.\"\n\nHyrst stopped fighting the straps. He began to frown. Christina lifted\nher head again. She did not say anything. The two Lazarites who had done\nthe probe stood still and held their breath.\n\nShearing's mind touched Hyrst's stroking it as with soothing fingers.\n\"Let's think about that for a minute. Let your thoughts move freely.\nMacDonald was an engineer. The engineer. Of the four, he alone knew\nevery inch of the physical set-up of the refinery. So?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's right. But that doesn't say where--Wait a minute, though.\nIf he'd just shoved it in a crack somewhere in the mountains, he'd know\na detector might find it, more easily than before it was dug. He'd have\nput it some where deep, deeper than he could possibly dig. Maybe in an\nabandoned mine?\"\n\n\"No place,\" said Shearing, \"is too deep for us to probe. We've examined\nevery abandoned mine on that side of Titan. And it doesn't fit, anyway.\nNo. Try again.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't have brought it back to the refinery. One of us would be\nsure to find it. Unless, of course--\"\n\nHyrst stopped, and the tension in the sick-bay tightened another notch.\nThe ship lurched sharply, swerved, and shot upward with a deafening\nthunder of rocket-blasts. Hyrst shut his eyes, thinking hard.\n\n\"Unless he put it in some place so dangerous that nobody ever went\nthere. A place where even he didn't go, but which he would know about\nbeing the engineer.\"\n\n\"Can you think of any place that would answer that description?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hyrst slowly. \"The underground storage bins. They're always\nhot, even when they're empty. Anything hidden near them would be\nblanketed by radiation. No detector would see anything but uranium.\nProbably even you wouldn't.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Shearing, looking amazed. \"Probably we wouldn't. The\nradioactive disturbance would be too strong to get through, even if we\nwere looking for something beyond it, which we weren't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChristina had sprung up. Now she bent over Hyrst and said, \"But is there\na way it could have been done? Obviously, the Titanite couldn't have\nbeen put directly into the bin with the uranium--if nothing else, it\nwould have been shipped out in the next tanker.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Hyrst. \"There would be several ways. I can think of a\ncouple myself, and I've never even see the layout. The repair-lift\nshaft, I know, goes clear down to the feeder mechanism, and there's some\nkind of a system of dispersal tunnels and an emergency gadget that trips\nautomatically to release a liquid-graphite damping material into them in\ncase the radiation level gets too high. I don't remember that it ever\ndid, but it's a safeguard. There'd be plenty of places to hide a lead\nbox full of Titanite.\"\n\n\"_Unless I show them how_,\" repeated Shearing slowly, and began to undo\nthe straps that held Hyrst to the table. \"It has an ominous sound. I'll\nbet you that locating the Titanite will be child's play compared to\ngetting it out. Well, we'll do what we can.\"\n\n\"The first thing,\" said Christina grimly, \"is to get rid of Bellaver. If\nhe has the slightest suspicion where we're headed he'll radio ahead and\nhave all Titan alerted.\"\n\nHyrst, sitting up now on the edge of the table, hanging on against the\nlurching of the ship, said, \"That's right--he owns the refinery now,\ndoesn't he? Is it still working?\"\n\n\"No. The mines around there played out, oh, ten, fifteen years ago. The\nactivity's shifted to the north and east on the other side of the range.\nThat is what may possibly give us a chance.\" Shearing staggered with\nHyrst across the bucking deck and sat tailor-fashion in the bunk, his\neyes intent. \"Hyrst, I want you to remember everything you can about the\nrefinery. The ground plan, exactly where the buildings are, the hoists,\nthe landing field. Everything.\"\n\nHyrst said, showing the edges of his teeth, \"When do I get Vernon?\"\n\n\"You'll get him. I promise you.\"\n\n\"What about Bellaver? He's still behind us.\"\n\nShearing smiled. \"That's Christina's job! Let her worry.\"\n\nHyrst nodded. He began to remember the refinery. Christina and the other\ntwo went out.\n\nA short while later a number of things happened, violently, and in quick\nsuccession. The ship of the Lazarites, pursuing its wild and headlong\ncourse through the swarming debris of the Belt, was far ahead of\nBellaver's yacht but still within instrument range. Apparently in\ndesperation it plunged suddenly on a tangential course into a cluster of\ngreat jagged rocks all travelling together at a furious rate of speed.\nThe cluster was perhaps two hundred miles across. The Lazarite ship\ntwisted and turned, and then there was a swift bright flowering of\nflame, and then nothing.\n\n\"She's blown her tubes,\" said Bellaver exultantly, on the bridge of his\nyacht. The instruments had lost contact, chiefly because the cluster was\nso thick that it was impossible to separate one body from another.\n\nVernon said, \"They're not blanking my mind any more. It stopped, like\nthat.\"\n\nBut he was still doubtful.\n\n\"Can you locate the ship?\" asked Bellaver.\n\n\"I'm trying.\"\n\nBellaver caught his arm. \"Look there!\"\n\nThere was a second, larger and more brilliant, flash of flame.\n\n\"They've hit an asteroid,\" he said. \"They're done for.\"\n\n\"I can't locate them,\" Vernon said. \"No ship, no wreckage. It could be a\ntrick. They could be holding a cloak.\"\n\n\"A trick?\" said Bellaver. \"I doubt it. Anyway, we're running low on\nfuel, and I'm not going to go into that cluster and risk my own neck to\nfind out. If by any chance they do come out again later on, we'll deal\nwith them.\"\n\nBut they both watched the cluster until it had whirled on out of sight.\nAnd neither eye nor instrument nor Vernon's probing mind could\ndistinguish any sign of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nTitan lay below them in the Saturn-glow, under the fantastic glory of\nthe Rings. A bitter, repellent world of jagged peaks and glimmering\nplains of poison snow. The tiny life-raft dropped toward it, skittering\nnervously as it hit the thin atmosphere. Hyrst clung hard to the\nhandholds, trying not to retch. He was not habituated to space anyway,\nand the skiff had been bad enough. Now, without any hull around him and\nnothing but a curved shield in front of him, he felt like an ant on a\nflying leaf.\n\n\"I don't like it either.\" Shearing said. \"But it gives us a fifty-fifty\nchance of getting through unnoticed. Radar usually isn't looking for\nanything so small.\"\n\n\"_I_ understand all the reasons,\" Hyrst said. \"It's my stomach that's\nobtuse.\"\n\nHe could make out the pattern of the refinery now, a million miles of\nvertigo below him. The Lazarite ship was somewhere up and out behind\nthem, hiding in the Rings. The trick had worked with Bellaver out there\nin the Belt, and they hoped now that it would work with Bellaver's\nobservers on Titan. There was no need for any fake explosions this time,\nto give the impression of destruction. Secrecy was the watch-word, all\nlights out and jet-blasts muffled to a spark. Later, when Hyrst and\nShearing had accomplished their mission, the ship would drop down fast\nand take them off, with the Titanite, before any patrol craft would have\ntime to arrive.\n\nThey hoped.\n\nThe buildings of the refinery were dark and cold, drifted out of shape\nby an accumulation of the thin, evil snow. The spiderweb of roads had\nfaded from the plain, and the landing field was smooth and unmarked.\nAround its perimeter the six stiff towers of the hoists stood up like\nlonely sentinels, hooded and cloaked.\n\nHyrst felt a sudden tightening of his throat, and this was a thing he\nhad not expected. A refinery on Titan was hardly a thing to be\nsentimental about. But it was bound up so intimately with other things,\nwith hopes for a future that was now far behind him, with plans for\nElena and the kids that were now a cruel mockery, with friendly memories\nof Saul and Landers, now long dead, that he could not look at it\nunmoved.\n\n\"Let's try again,\" said Shearing quietly. \"If we could locate the\nTitanite definitely it might make all the difference. We'll hardly have\ntime to search all six of the bins.\"\n\nGlad of the distraction, Hyrst tried. He linked his mind to Shearing's\nand they probed with this double probe, one after the other, the six\nhoists and the bins beneath them, while the raft fell whistling down the\nair.\n\nIt was the same as all the tries before. The bins had been empty for\nmore than a decade, but the residual radiation was still hot enough to\npresent a luminous haze to the eyes of the mind, fogging everything\naround it.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Hyrst said. \"Let's use our wits. Look at the way those\nhoists are placed, in a wide crescent. Now if I was MacDonald, coming in\nfrom the mountains with a load of Titanite, and I wanted not to be seen,\nwhich one would I pick?\"\n\n\"Either One or Six,\" said Shearing, without hesitation. \"They're the\nfarthest away from the buildings.\"\n\n\"But Number Six is at the west end of the crescent, and to reach it you\nwould have to go clear across the landing field.\" He pointed mentally to\nNumber One. \"I'll bet on that one. Shall we give it another try?\"\n\nThey did. This time, for a fleeting second, Hyrst thought he had\nsomething.\n\n\"So did I,\" said Shearing. \"Sort of down under and _behind_.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hyrst. \"_Look_ out!\" His involuntary cry was caused by the\nsudden collision of the life-raft with a cloud. The vapor was very\nthick, and after the cruel clarity of space it made Hyrst feel that he\nwas smothering. Shearing jockeyed the raft's meagre controls, and in a\nminute or two they were below the cloud and spiralling down toward the\nlanding field. It was snowing.\n\n\"Good,\" said Shearing. \"We'll hope it keeps up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey landed close to Number One Hoist and floundered rapidly through the\nshallow drifts, carrying some things. The hatch had been sealed with a\nplastic spray to prevent corrosion, and it took them several minutes to\nget it open. Inside the tower it was pitch black, but they did not need\nlights. Their other senses showed them the worn metal treads of the\nsteps quite clearly. In the upper chamber the indicator panels were dark\nand dead. Hyrst shivered inside his suit. He had been here so many times\nbefore, so long ago.\n\n\"Let's get busy,\" Shearing said.\n\nThey pulled on the rayproofs they had brought with them from the raft.\nWithout power the lift was useless, but the skeleton cage, stripped of\nall its tools, was not too heavy for two strong men to swing clear of\nthe shaft top. They made sure it would stay clear, and then sent down a\nlight collapsible ladder. Hyrst slid down first into the smooth, round,\ntotally unlighted hole, that had one segment of it open paralleling the\nmachinery of the hoist.\n\n\"Take it carefully,\" Shearing said, and slid after him.\n\nClumsy in vac-suit and rayproof, Hyrst descended the ladder with\nagonizing slowness. Every impulse cried out for haste, but he knew if he\nhurried he would wind up at the bottom of the shaft as dead as\nMacDonald. The banging and knocking of their passage against the metal\nwall made a somber, hollow booming in that enclosed space, and it seemed\nto Hyrst that the silent belts and cables of the hoist hummed a little\nin sympathy. It was probably only the blood humming in his own ears.\n\n\"See anything yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe vast strange glowing of the bin grew brighter as they approached it.\nThe hoist was still \"hot,\" and it glowed too, but nothing like the\nconcentration in the bin.\n\n\"Even with rayproofs, we can't stay close to that too long.\"\n\n\"I don't think we'll have to. MacDonald was only human, and the bin was\nfull then. He couldn't have stayed long either.\"\n\n\"See anything yet?\"\n\n\"Nothing but fog. When you hit bottom, better use your light.\"\n\nAt long last Hyrst felt the bottom of the shaft under his boots. He\nstood aside from the ladder and switched on his belt lamp. In this case\nthe physical eyes were better than the mental, being insensitive to\nradiation. Instantly the gears and cams of the feeder assembly sprang\ninto sharp relief on the open side of the shaft. Shearing stumbled down\noff the ladder and switched on his own light.\n\n\"Where was it we thought we saw something?\"\n\n\"Down under and behind.\" Hyrst turned slowly around, questing. The shaft\nwas unbroken except by the repair opening. He climbed through it, with\nsome difficulty, because nobody was supposed to climb through it and the\nmachinery was placed for easy access with extension tools from the lift.\nThe bin itself was now directly opposite them, a big hopper cut deep in\nthe solid rock and serving the feeder by simple gravity. The feeder\npretty well filled its own rocky chamber. A place might have been found\nbeside it for something not too big, but the first man who came down on\nthe lift would have seen it whether he was looking for it or not.\n\nShearing pointed. A dark opening pierced the rock at one side. Hyrst\ntried to see into it with his mental eyes, but the \"fog\" was so dense\nand bright--\n\nHe saw it, an unsubstantial ghostly shadow, but there. A square box some\ntwenty feet down the tunnel.\n\nShearing drew a quick sharp breath \"Let's go.\"\n\nThey went into the tunnel, crouching, scraping against the narrow sides.\n\n\"Look out for booby traps.\"\n\n\"I don't see any--yet.\"\n\nThe box sat in the middle of the tunnel. There was no way to get around\nit, no way to see over it without lying on its top and wriggling between\nit and the low roof. Hyrst and Shearing shut their eyes.\n\n\"I'm not sure, but I think I see a wire. Damn the fog. Can't tell where\nit goes--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHyrst took cutters from his belt and slithered cautiously over the box.\nHis heart was hammering very hard and his hand shook so that he had\ngreat difficulty getting the cutters and the wire together. The wire was\nattached to the back of the box, very crudely and hastily attached with\na blob of plastic solder. It was not until he had pinched the wire with\nthe sharp metal cutter-teeth that he realized the plastic was\nnon-metallic and the wire bare. And then, of course, it was too late.\n\nThere must have been a simple energizer somewhere up ahead, still\ncharging itself from the ample radiation source. The cutters flew out of\nHyrst's hand in a shower of sparks, and in the darkness of the tunnel\nahead there was a sudden wild flare of light, and an explosion of dust.\nA shock wave, not too great, hammered past Hyrst's helmet. Shearing\nyelled once, a protest broken short in mid-cry. Then they waited.\n\nThe dust settled. The brief tremor of the rock was stilled.\n\nIn the roof of the tunnel, where the blast had been, a broken dump-trap\nhung open, but nothing poured out of it but a handful of black dust.\n\nHyrst began to laugh. He lay on his belly on top of the box of Titanite\nand laughed. The tears ran out of his eyes and down his nose and dropped\nonto the inside of his helmet. Shearing hit him from behind. He hit him\nuntil he stopped laughing, and then Hyrst shook his head and said.\n\n\"Poor MacDonald.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Go ahead, you can cut the wire now.\"\n\n\"Such a lovely booby trap. But he wasn't figuring on time. They went\naway from here, Shearing, you see? And when they went they drained off\nthe liquid graphite and took it with them. So there isn't anything left\nto flood the tunnel. Pathetic, isn't it?\"\n\nShearing hit him again. \"Cut the wire.\"\n\nHe cut it. They scuffled backward down the tunnel, dragging the box.\nWhen they got back into the shaft where there was room to do it they\nopened up the box.\n\n\"Doesn't look like much, does it, for all the trouble it's made?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't. But then gold doesn't look like much, or uranium, or a\nhandful of little dry seeds.\" Shearing picked up a chunk of the rough,\ngrayish ore. \"You know what that is, Hyrst? That's the stars.\"\n\nIt was Hyrst's turn to prod Shearing into quiet. The starship and the\ndream that went with it were still only an intellectual interest to him.\nThey shared out the Titanite into two webbing sacks. It made a light\nload for each, hardly noticeable when clipped to a belt-ring at the\nback.\n\nHyrst felt suddenly very nervous. Perhaps it was reaction, perhaps it\nwas the memory of having been trapped in a similar hole on the Valhalla\nasteroid. Perhaps it was a mental premonition, obscured by the\nradioactive \"fog\". At any rate, he started to climb the ladder with\nalmost suicidal haste, urging Shearing on after him. The shaft seemed to\nbe a mile high. It seemed to lengthen ahead of him as he climbed, so\nthat he was never any nearer the top. He knew it was only imagination,\nbecause he passed the level markers, but it was the closest thing to a\nnightmare he had ever experienced when he was broad awake. Just after\nthey had passed the E Level mark, Shearing spoke.\n\n\"A ship has landed.\"\n\nHyrst looked mentally. The fog-effect was not so great now, and he could\nsee quite clearly. It was a small ship, and two men were getting out of\nit. It had stopped snowing.\n\n\"Radar must have picked up the raft after all,\" said Shearing. \"Or else\nsomebody spotted the jet-flares.\" He began to climb faster. \"We better\nget out of this before they come in.\"\n\nD Level. Hyrst's hands were cold and stiff inside his gauntlets, clumsy\nhooks to catch the slender rungs. The two men were standing outside in\nthe snow, peering around.\n\nC Level. One of the two men saw the raft parked by the hoist tower. He\npointed, and they moved toward it.\n\nB Level. Hyrst's boots slipped and scrambled, banging the shaft wall.\n\"Christ,\" said Shearing. \"You sound like a temple gong. What are you\ntrying to do, alarm the whole moon?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men outside bent over the raft. They looked at it. Then they looked\nat the hoist tower. They left the raft and began to run, pulling guns\nout of their belts.\n\nA Level. Hyrst's breath roared in his helmet like a great wind. He\nthought of the long dark way down that was below them, and how MacDonald\nhad looked at the bottom of the shaft, and how he would take Shearing\nwith him if he fell, and nobody would get to the stars, and Vernon would\ngo free. He set his teeth, and sobbed, and climbed. Outside, the two men\ncautiously removed the hatch and stepped into the tower.\n\nEnd of the ladder. A level floor to sprawl on. Hyrst squirmed away from\nthe shaft. He thought for a minute he was going to pass out, and he\nfumbled with the oxygen valve, making the mixture richer. His head began\nto clear. Shearing was now beside him. This time they had guns, too.\nShearing gave him a quick mental caution, _Not unless you have to_. One\nof the two men was placing a tentative foot on the stair that led up to\nwhere they were. The other man was close behind him. Shearing took\ncareful aim and fired, at half power.\n\nThe harsh blue bolt did not strike either man. But they went reeling\nback in a cloud of burning flakes, and when Shearing shouted to them to\ndrop their weapons and get out they did so, half stunned from the shock.\nHyrst and Shearing leaped down the stairs, stopping only long enough to\npick up the guns. Then they scrambled outside. The two men were running\nas hard as they could for their ship, but they had not gone far and\nShearing stopped them with another shot that sent a geyser of methane\nsteam puffing up practically under their feet.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"Later.\"\n\nThe two men stood, sullenly obedient. They were both young, and not bad\nlooking. Just doing a job, Hyrst thought. No real harm in them, just\ndoing a job, like so many people who never stop to worry about what the\njob means. They both wore Bellaver's insigne on their vac-suits.\n\nOne of them said, as though he were reciting a lesson in which he had no\nreal personal interest, \"You're trespassing on private property. You'll\nbe prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Shearing. He motioned to the hoist tower. \"Back inside.\"\n\nThe young men hesitated. \"What you going to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing fatal. It shouldn't take you more than half an hour to break\nout again.\"\n\nHe marched them to the hatch and saw them inside it. Hyrst was watching\nthe sky, the black star-glittering sky with the glorious arch of the\nRings across it and one milky-bright curve of Saturn visible and growing\nabove the eastern horizon.\n\n\"They're coming,\" he said mentally to Shearing.\n\n\"Good.\" He started to close the hatch, and one of the young men pointed\nsuddenly to the sack clipped to Shearing's belt.\n\n\"You've been stealing something.\"\n\n\"Tell that to Bellaver.\"\n\n\"You bet I will. The fullest extent of the law, mister! The fullest\nextent--\"\n\nThe hatch closed. Shearing jammed the fastening mechanism so it could\nnot be turned from the inside. Then he went and stood beside Hyrst in\nthe glimmering plain, watching the ship drop down out of the Rings.\n\nHyrst said, \"They'll tell Bellaver.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"What will Bellaver do?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. Something drastic. He wants our starship so hard he'd\nmurder his own children to get it. You can see why. In itself it's\npriceless, a hundred years ahead of its time, but that's not all. It's\nwhat it stands for. To us it means freedom and safety. To Bellaver it\nmeans--\"\n\nHe gestured toward the sky, and Hyrst nodded, seeing in Shearing's mind\nthe image of a gigantic Bellaver, ten times bigger than God, gathering\nthe whole galaxy into his arms.\n\n\"I wish you luck,\" said Hyrst. He unhooked the sack of Titanite from his\nbelt and gave it to Shearing. \"It'll take a little while to refine the\nstuff and build the relays, even so. That may be time enough. Come back\nfor me if you can.\"\n\n\"Vernon?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShearing nodded. \"I said I'd help you get him. I will.\"\n\n\"No. This is my job. I'll do it alone. You belong there, with them. With\nChristina.\"\n\n\"Hyrst. Listen--\"\n\n\"Don't tell me where the starship is. I might not hold out as well as\nyou.\"\n\n\"All right, but Hyrst--in case we can't get back--look for us away from\nthe Sun. Not toward it.\"\n\n\"I'll remember.\"\n\nThe ship landed. Shearing entered it, carrying the Titanite. And Hyrst\nwalked away, toward the closed and buried buildings of the refinery.\n\nIt had begun to snow again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nIt was cold and dark and infinitely sad. Hyrst wandered through the\nrooms, feeling like a ghost, thinking like one. Everything had been\nremoved from the buildings. The living quarters were now mere cubicular\ntombs for a lot of memories, absolutely bare of any human or familiar\ntouch. It felt very strange to Hyrst. He kept telling himself that fifty\nyears had passed, but he could not believe it. It seemed only a few\nmonths since MacDonald's death, months occupied by investigation and\ntrial and the raging, futile anguish of the unjustly accused. The long\ninterval of the pseudo-death was no more than a night's sleep, to a mind\nunconscious of passing time. Now it seemed that Saul and Landers should\nstill be here, and there should be lights and warmth and movement.\n\nThere was nothing. He could not bring himself to stay in the living\nquarters. He went into one of the storerooms and sat on a concrete\nbuttress and waited. It was a long and dreadful wait. During it all the\nemotional storms occasioned by the murder and its aftermath passed\nthrough his mind. Scenes with Saul and Landers. Scenes with the\ninvestigators, with MacDonald's family, with lawyers and reporters.\nScenes with Elena. The whole terrible nightmare, leading inevitably to\nthat culminating moment when the door of the airlock opened and he\njoined the sleepers on the plain. When it was all over Hyrst felt shaken\nand exhausted, but calm. The face of Vernon burned brightly in his\nmind's eye.\n\nWithout bothering to open the steel-shuttered windows, he watched the\ntwo young men force their way out of the hoist tower. He watched them\nrun to their ship and chatter excitedly over their radio. By the time,\nmuch later, that Bellaver's yacht came screaming down to the landing\nfield on a flaming burst of jets, he could watch it with almost the cool\ndetachment of a spectator. He was careful to keep his shields up tight\nagainst Vernon, and he did not think the other Lazarite would be likely\nto look for him. Vernon seemed to be fully occupied with Bellaver.\n\n\"_What else would they be stealing, you fool? You should have, killed\nHyrst before, when you had the chance._\"\n\n\"_Somebody had to take the blame for MacDonald. Anyway, you had him\naboard the_ Happy Dream. _Why didn't you hang onto him?_\"\n\n\"_Don't get insolent with me, Vernon. I can turn you over to the police\nanytime, for any one of a hundred things._\"\n\n\"_Not without tipping your hand, Bellaver._\"\n\n\"_It would be worth it._\" A string of foul names, delivered in a furious\nscream. \"_You couldn't locate the Titanite, but they did, just as soon\nas they got hold of Hyrst._\"\n\n\"_All right, Mr. God Almighty Bellaver, turn me in. But if it was the\nTitanite they took, you haven't a chance of finding that starship\nwithout me._\"\n\n\"_You haven't done very well at it so far._\"\n\n\"_In the excitement, they may get careless. But it's up to you._\"\n\nMore foul language, but Bellaver did not repeat his threat. He and\nVernon, with a couple of other men, got into vac-suits and lumbered\nacross the snow to the hoist tower. From inside the cold dark buried\nbuilding, Hyrst watched them, and thought hard and fast, and smiled.\nPresently he left the building and circled cautiously through the snowy\ngloom until he was in range of their helmet-communicators. He could hear\nthem aurally now, but he kept watching them, esper-fashion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey inspected the empty lead box, and the young men told what had\nhappened, and Bellaver turned his raging fury against them. There was no\nlonger any doubt that the Titanite had been found and taken away, and\nBellaver saw the stars and worlds and moons, the bright glowing plunder\nof a galaxy, slipping away from him. He threatened the two young men\nwith every punishment he could think of for not having stopped the\nthieves, and one of the young men turned white and anxious, and the\nother one flushed brick red and shook his fist close to Bellaver's\nhelmet.\n\n\"You go to hell,\" he said. \"I don't care who you are. You go to hell.\"\n\nHe walked out of the hoist tower, with his companion stumbling at his\nheels, and Bellaver screamed after them, and behind him the crewmen\nlooked shocked and contemptuous, and Vernon laughed openly, showing the\nedges of his teeth.\n\nThe two young men got into their ship and went away. Bellaver turned and\nstood looking at the empty box. He seemed exhausted now, hopeless, like\na child about to break down and cry. Vernon went over and kicked the\nbox.\n\n\"Hyrst had the advantage,\" he said. \"He knew MacDonald and he knew the\nrefinery. Even so, it must have been pure guesswork. Nobody could probe\nthrough that fog.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" asked Bellaver. \"Vernon, what are we going to\ndo?\"\n\nHyrst spoke for the first time, his voice ringing loud and startling in\ntheir ears.\n\n\"Don't ask Vernon,\" he said. \"Ask me.\"\n\nThere was a moment of complete silence. Hyrst felt Vernon's mind brush\nhis, and he permitted himself one cruel flash of triumph. Then everybody\nspoke at once, Vernon explaining why he hadn't spotted Hyrst--who could\nhave figured he'd stay behind at a time like this?--the crew-members\nnervously fingering their guns, and Bellaver crying,\n\n\"Hyrst! Is that you, Hyrst? Where are you?\"\n\n\"Where I can get the first shot at anybody coming out of the tower, and\nwhere nobody from the yacht will ever reach me. Tell them all to stay\nput. Go ahead, Bellaver, you want to hear me out, don't you?\"\n\n\"What do you want to say?\"\n\n\"I can find you that starship. Tell them, Bellaver.\"\n\nHe told them. And Vernon said to Bellaver, \"If he's willing to betray\nhis friends, why would he get them the Titanite?\" He laughed. \"It isn't\neven a good trick.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it is,\" said Hyrst softly. \"It's a very good one. The best.\nYou see, I don't care about the starship or the Titanite. All I care\nabout is the man who killed MacDonald. They were sort of bound up\ntogether. Ever hear of latent impressions, Vernon? I was unconscious,\nbut my ears heard and my eyes saw, and my brain remembered, when it was\nshown how.\"\n\n\"That was fifty years ago,\" said Vernon. \"People don't understand about\nus. Nobody would believe you if you told them.\"\n\n\"They would if Bellaver told them. They would if Bellaver explained out\nloud about the Lazarites, about what happens to men when they go through\nthe door. They'd listen to him. And there must be others who know, or at\nleast suspect.\" Hyrst paused, long enough to smile. \"The beauty of that\nis, Bellaver, that you're in the clear. You're not responsible for a\nmurder your grandfather had done. You could swear you didn't even know\nabout it until now.\"\n\nVernon said to Bellaver, \"If you do this to me, I'll blast you wide\nopen.\"\n\n\"What can he do, Bellaver?\" Hyrst shouted. \"He can talk, but you have\nthe money, the position, the legal powers. You can talk louder. And when\nthey know the truth, will anybody take the word of a Lazarite against a\nhuman man?\"\n\nHis voice rose higher and louder, drowning out Vernon's cry.\n\n\"Are you afraid of him, Bellaver? Are you so afraid of him you'll let\nthe starship go?\"\n\n\"Hold him.\" Bellaver said, and the crewmen held Vernon fast. \"Wait a\nminute, Hyrst,\" he said. \"What's your angle? Is it just revenge? Are you\nselling out your friends for something over and done half a century ago?\nI don't believe it, Hyrst.\"\n\nHyrst said slowly, \"I can answer that, so even you will understand. I\nhave children. They're getting old now. They've lived all their lives\nthinking their father killed a man, not for love or for justice or in\nself-defense, but for sheer cold-blooded greed. I want them to know it\nwasn't so.\"\n\n\"Hold him!\" Bellaver said. The crewmen struggled with Vernon, and Vernon\nsaid viciously to Bellaver,\n\n\"He'll never lead you to the starship. I can read his mind. When you've\nturned me in and blackened your grandfather's name to clear him, he'll\nlaugh in your face. What are you, Bellaver, a fool?\"\n\n\"Am I, Hyrst?\"\n\n\"That's for you to find out. I'm offering you the starship for Vernon,\nand that's fair enough, because I want him as bad as you want it. And I\ncan tell you, Bellaver, if you decide to play it smart and call in your\nguards to hunt me down, it will do you no good. I won't be alive when\nthey take me.\"\n\nSilence. In his mind's eye Hyrst could see the beads of sweat running\ndown Bellaver's face behind his helmet. He could see Vernon's face, too.\nIt gave him pleasure.\n\n\"It should be an easy decision, Bellaver,\" he said. \"After all, suppose\nI am lying. What have you got to lose but Vernon? And with his record,\nthat isn't much.\"\n\n\"Hold him,\" said Bellaver. \"All right, Hyrst. I'll do it. But I'll tell\nyou now. If you lie to me, there won't be any re-awakening in another\nfifty years. This will be for good.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" said Hyrst. \"I'm putting my gun away. I'm coming in.\"\n\nHe walked quickly through the snow toward the tower.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nOn the bridge of his yacht, Bellaver turned to Hyrst and said,\n\n\"I've done what you wanted. Now find me that starship.\"\n\nHyrst nodded. \"Take off.\"\n\nThe rockets roared and thundered, and the swift yacht leaped quivering\ninto the sky.\n\nHyrst sat quietly in his recoil chair. He felt a different man, changed\nentirely in the last few days. Much had happened in those days.\n\nBellaver had got busy on the radio even before his yacht left Titan, and\nthe story of the Lazarites had burst like a nova upon the Solar System.\nAlready there were instances of suspected Lazarites being mobbed by\ntheir neighbors, and Government was frantically concerning itself with\nall the new, far-reaching implications of the Humane Penalty.\n\nClose on the heels of this bomb-shell had come Vernon's angry\naccusations against Bellaver, delivered as soon as he was given to the\nauthorities on Mars. During the twenty Martian hours necessary for\nformal charge and the taking of depositions, and while Bellaver's yacht\nwas being refueled, Vernon's story of the starship went out on all the\ninterworld circuits. And it had been as Christina had said. The whole\nSolar System was frantic to have the Lazarites caught and stopped, and\nevery man in space became a self-appointed searcher for the hidden\nstarship. Bellaver, letting his lawyers worry about Vernon's\naccusations, had already laid formal claim to that ship, based on the\nvalue of the stolen Titanite.\n\n\"Where?\" demanded Bellaver now, in a fury of impatience. \"Where?\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Hyrst. \"There are too many watching, ready to follow you.\nThey know what you're after. Wait till we're clear of Mars.\"\n\nHe sat in his chair, looking into space. His drive was all gone, and the\nanger that had fed it. Somewhere his son and his two daughters were\ndrawing their first free breaths relieved of a burden they should never\nhave had to carry. They knew now that he was innocent, and they could\nthink of him now without bitterness, speak his name without hate. He had\ndone what he had set out to do, and he was finished. He knew what was\nahead of him, but he was too tired to care.\n\nThe yacht went fast, away from the old red weary planet. Hyrst thought\nof Shearing and Christina and the others, laboring over their ship on\nthe dark plain. He felt safe in doing this, because Vernon was gone and\nthe gray evil man who had helped to torture Shearing aboard the _Happy\nDream_ was still in an Earth hospital recovering from the blow Hyrst had\ngiven him. They were out of reach, and Hyrst was the only Lazarite\nBellaver had.\n\nHe did not try to get through to Shearing because he knew that was\nimpossible, and there was no reason for it anyway. He let his mind\nstretch out and rove through the nighted spaces beyond Saturn, beyond\nUranus and Neptune, beyond the black and frigid bulk of Pluto. He did\nnot see the ship nor touch a Lazarite mind, and so he knew that they\nwere still holding the cloak, still hiding from possible betrayal. He\nwithdrew his mind, and wished them luck.\n\n\"We're clear of Mars,\" said Bellaver. \"Which way?\"\n\n\"That way,\" said Hyrst, and pointed. \"Toward the Sun.\"\n\nThe yacht swerved and steadied on a new course, toward the distant glare\nof Sol. And Bellaver said,\n\n\"What's the exact location?\"\n\n\"Can you trust every man in this crew?\" asked Hyrst. \"Can you be sure\nnot one of them would give it away, when we stop to refuel? You're not\nthe only one that knows about the starship now, remember.\"\n\n\"You could tell _me_.\"\n\n\"You're too impatient, Bellaver. You'd want to head straight there, and\nit won't be that easy. They have defenses. We have to be careful, or\nthey'll destroy the ship before we reach it.\"\n\n\"Or finish their relays and go.\" Bellaver gave Hyrst a long look. \"I'll\ntrust you because I have to. But I wasn't making an empty threat. And\nI'll do it so there won't be any thought of murder. You'd better find me\nthat ship, Hyrst.\"\n\nFrom then on, Bellaver hardly slept. He paced the corridors and haunted\nthe control room and watched Hyrst with a gnawing, agonizing doubt.\nHyrst began to feel for him a distant sort of pity, as he might have\nfelt for a man afflicted by some disease brought on by his own excesses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe yacht passed the orbit of Earth, refueled at an obscure space\nstation, and sped on. Hyrst continued to stall Bellaver, ordering a\nchange of course from time to time to keep him happy. At intervals he\nlet his mind rove through those dark spaces they were leaving farther\nbehind with every passing second. Each time it was a greater effort, but\nstill there was no sign of the starship or its base, and so he knew that\nthe labor still went on.\n\nBy the time the yacht reached the orbit of Venus a fan-shaped cordon of\nother ships had collected around and behind her drawn by the word that\nBellaver was on his way to find the starship. Government patrols were in\nconstant touch.\n\n\"They can't interfere,\" said Bellaver. \"I've got a lien on that ship, a\nformal claim.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Hyrst. \"But you'd better be the first to find it.\nPossession, you know. Bear off a bit. Mislead them. They're sure now\nthey know where you're going.\"\n\n\"Don't they?\" said Bellaver, looking ahead at the glittering spark that\nwas Mercury. \"There isn't anyplace else to go.\"\n\n\"Isn't there?\"\n\nBellaver stared at him, narrow-eyed. \"The legend of the Vulcan was\nexploded by the first explorers. There is no intra-Mercurial world.\"\n\nHyrst shot a swift stabbing mental glance toward Pluto. Still nothing.\nHe sighed and said easily,\n\n\"There wasn't then. There is now.\"\n\nHe brazened out the look of incredulity on Bellaver's face.\n\n\"These are Lazarites, remember, not men. They built a place for\nthemselves where nobody would ever think to look. Not a planet, of\ncourse, just a floating workshop. A satellite. And now you know. So you\ncan let them beat you to Mercury.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Bellaver softly. \"All right.\"\n\nThey passed Mercury, lost in the blaze of the Sun, and only a few ships\nfollowed them, far behind. The rest stopped to search the craggy valleys\nof the Twilight Belt, and the bleak icefields of the Dark Side.\n\nAnd now Hyrst had run his string out, and he knew it. When no\nintra-Mercurial satellite showed up, physically or on detector-screens,\nthere was no further lie to tell. He drove his mind out and away, to the\ncold planets wheeling on the fringes of Sol's light, and he sweated, and\nprayed, and hoped that nothing had gone wrong. And suddenly the cloak\nwas dropped, and he saw a lonesome chip of rock beyond Pluto, all\nhollowed out for shops and living quarters, and the great ship standing\nin the mile-long plain, with the stars all drifted overhead. And the\nship lifted from the plain, circled upward, and suddenly was not.\n\nHyrst was bitterly sorry that he was not aboard. But he told Bellaver,\n\"You can stop looking now. They've got away.\"\n\nHe watched Bellaver die, standing erect on his feet, still breathing,\nbut dying inside with the last outgoing of hope.\n\n\"I thought you were lying,\" he said, \"but it was the only chance I had.\"\nHe nodded, looking toward the shuttered port with the insufferable blaze\noutside. He said, in a flat, dead voice, \"If you were put out here,\nbound, in a lifeboat, headed toward the Sun--Yes. I could make up a\nstory to fit that.\"\n\nIn the same toneless voice, he called his men. And suddenly the yacht\nlurched over shuddering in the backwash of some tremendous energy. Hyrst\nand the others were flung scattering against the bulk-heads, and the\nlights went out, and the instruments went dead.\n\nBeyond the port, on the unshuttered side away from the Sun, a vast dark\nshape had materialized out of nothing, to hang close in space beside the\nyacht.\n\nHyrst heard in his mind, strong and clear, the voice of Shearing saying,\n\"Didn't I tell you the brotherhood stands by its own? Besides, we\ncouldn't make a liar out of you, now could we?\"\n\nHyrst began to laugh, just a little bit hysterically. He told Bellaver,\n\"There's your starship. And Shearing says if I'm not alive when he comes\naboard to get me, that they won't be as careful about warping space when\nthey go away as they were when they came.\"\n\nBellaver did not say anything. He sat on the deck where the shock had\nthrown him, not speaking. He was still sitting there when Hyrst passed\nthrough the airlock into the starship's boat, and he did not move even\nwhen the great ship vanished silently into whatever mysterious\nultra-space the minds of the Lazarites had unlocked, outbound for the\nlimitless freedom of the universe, where the wheeling galaxies thunder\non forever across infinity and the stars burn bright, and there is\nnothing to stop the march of the Legion of Lazarus. And who knew, who\ncould tell, where that march would end?\n\nAboard the starship, already a million miles away, Hyrst said to\nChristina. \"When they brought me back from beyond the door, that was\nre-awakening. But this--this is being born again.\"\n\nShe did not answer that. But she took his hand and smiled.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Legion of Lazarus, by Edmond Hamilton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LEGION OF LAZARUS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32486.txt or 32486.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/4/8/32486/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
