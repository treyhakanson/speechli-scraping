It moved with a pliant, liquid grace, its four\narms flickering over the instrument panel, installing studs, tightening\nscrews, its antennae glowing with the lambent yellow that denoted an\nagony of effort.\n\n\"See?\" Harvey's freckled face was smug. \"He rates an easy hundred and\nten. Whoever took that first study--\"\n\n\"I took it,\" I said, squinting at the stop watch.\n\nYou could hear him bite his lip. After only two weeks on the job, on a\nstrange planet ninety light-years from home, you don't tell your boss\nhe's cockeyed.\n\nThe Term hurried. Its faceted termite eyes were expressionless diamonds,\nbut the antennae gleamed a desperate saffron. _If bugs could sweat_, I\nthought wryly. Now the quartz panel installation. Those four arms moved\nin a blinding frenzy.\n\nBut the stop watch was faster. The second hand caught up with the Term.\nIt passed him. Rating: Seventy-four per cent.\n\nI tucked the clipboard under my arm, squeezed through the airlock, and\ndown the ramp. Harvey followed sullenly. The conveyor groaned on,\nbringing up the next unit, a sleek little cruiser. The Term seized a\nfifty-pound air wrench, fled up the ramp to the airlock.\n\n\"A dozen feet back to the operation,\" I pointed out. \"After the next job\nhe'll have to return forty feet. Then sixty. He's in the hole.\"\n\nHarvey looked at his shoes. John Barry, the trim superintendent, came\npuffing down the line, his jowled face anxious about direct labor cost,\nthe way every good super should be. \"Anything wrong, Jake?\"\n\n\"He can't cut it,\" I said.\n\nBarry frowned up through the airlock at the Term. Those antennae now\nshone the soft sad purple of despair.\n\nWe walked past the body jigs. The air was a haze of blue smoke,\npunctuated with yellow splashes of flame from the electronic welding\nguns. Terms scuttled like gigantic spiders over the great silver hulls,\ntheir antennae glowing in a pattern of swift bright harmony, right on\nstandard, good cost. Harvey's face was rapt as he watched them. I said\nharshly:\n\n\"Give me your third Production Axiom.\"\n\nHarvey's shoulders squared. He said stiffly: \"Beauty is functional. The\nquintessence of grace is the clean, soaring beauty of a spaceship's\nhull--\"\n\n\"Extrapolate, Harvey.\"\n\nHis lips were tight. \"What I see is ugly. Terms must be taught\nindividuality. What I see is a fascinating, deadly beauty--deadly\nbecause it's useless. We must sublimate it, grind it down, hammer it out\ninto a useful pattern. Waste motion is a sin....\"\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\nWe turned into the administration lift, leaving the iron roar behind us,\nand on the way up Harvey didn't say a word. I listened for the tinkle of\nshattering ideals, and said patiently, \"You're here to build spaceships.\nTo build them better and cheaper than Consolidated or Solar. Hell, we've\neven set up a village for the Terms! Electricity, plumbing, luxuries\nthey wouldn't normally enjoy for the next million years--\"\n\n\"Will they fire him?\" Harvey's voice was flat.\n\nMy temper was shredding. \"Four-day layoff. His third this month. Terms\nkick in most of their salary for village maintenance. They can't afford\na part-time producer.\"\n\nI could see that Term read out of the gang, leaving the company village,\nstoically, while his fellows played a wailing dirge of color on their\nantennae. The farewell song. I could see him trudging over the windswept\npeak of Cobalt Mountain, staring down at his native village, and shaking\nwith the impact of the _Stammverstand_, the tribe-mind, the ache and the\nlonging. A wheel, shaken out of orbit. The lonely cog, searching for its\nlost slot. I could see that Term returning to his tribe. And how they'd\ntear him to pieces because he was a thing apart, now, an alien.\n\nWe walked down the gray corridor, past Psych, past the conference hall,\nto the silver door marked _Methods and Standards_. Harvey's blue eyes\nwere remote, stubborn. I clapped him paternally on the shoulder. \"Anyone\ncan call one wrong, lad. Forget it.\"\n\nHarvey slumped down at a computor, and I walked into my private office\nand shut the door. Harvey's personnel dossier was in my desk. I.Q. 178,\nfair. Stability quotient two point eight, very bad. Adaptability rating\npoint seven, borderline. Those idiots in Psych! Couldn't they\nindoctrinate a new man properly?\n\nI waited.\n\nIn a moment Harvey came in without knocking and said, \"Mr. Eagan, I want\nto quit.\"\n\nI took my time lighting a cigar, not raising my head.\n\nHis defiant, pleading look.\n\nI blew smoke rings at the visicom and finally said, \"Since you were\nsixteen, you've dreamed of this. Elimination tests, the weeding out, ten\nthousand other smart, hungry kids fighting you for this job.\" I tasted\nthe words. \"When your contract's up you can write your own ticket\nanywhere in the system.\"\n\nHe blurted: \"I came here full of ideas about the wonderful work\nAmalgamated was doing to advance backward civilizations. Sure, the Terms\nhave a union. They're paid at standard galactic rates for spacecraft\nassembly. But you make them live in that village. It costs to run that\nvillage. You give it to them with one hand and take it back with the\nother. All the time you're holding out the promise of racial\nadvancement, individuality, some day the Terms will reach the stars.\nNuts!\"\n\n\"That's Guild propaganda,\" I said softly.\n\n\"The Guild is just a bogey you created to keep the Intersolar\nSpacecrafters Union in line. There's a Venusport liner due in next week.\nWhen it leaves I'll be on it!\"\n\nI played Dutch Uncle. I told him he wasn't used to Terminorb's\none-and-a-half gravs, that this was just a hangover from the three to\nfive oxygen ratio he wasn't used to. But he said no. Finally I shrugged,\nscribbled something on an AVO and handed it to him. \"All right, Harvey,\"\nI said mildly. \"Take this down to Carmody, in Psych. He'll give you a\nclearance.\"\n\nHarvey's face went white. \"Since when do you go to Psych for a\nclearance?\"\n\nI pressed a stud under the desk and two Analysts came in. I told them\nwhat to do and Harvey screamed; he fought and bit and clawed, he mouthed\nunutterable things about what we were doing to the Terms until I chopped\nhim mercifully behind the ear.\n\n\"Poor devil,\" panted one of the Analysts. \"Obviously insufficient\nindoctrination, sir. Would you mind if I spent an hour in Psych for\nreorientation? He--he upset me.\"\n\nMy eyes stung with pride. Sam had loyalty plus. \"Sure thing, Sam. You'd\nbetter go too, Barney. He said some pretty ugly things.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey dragged Harvey out and I went over to the visicom, punched a\nbutton. I was trembling with an icy rage as Carmody's lean hawk face\nswam into view. \"Hello, Jake,\" he said languidly. \"How's Cost?\"\n\nI told him curtly about Harvey. \"Another weak sister,\" I rasped. \"Can't\nyou screen them any more? Didn't you note his stability index? I'm going\nto report this to Starza, Don.\"\n\n\"Relax,\" Carmody smiled. \"Those things happen, Jake. We'll do a few\ngentle things with scalpel and narcosynthesis, and he'll be back in a\nweek, real eager, the perfect cost analyst.\"\n\nI'd never liked Carmody. He was so smug; he didn't realize the\n_sacredness_ of his position. I said coldly, \"Put Miss Davis on.\"\n\nCarmody's grin was knowing. The screen flickered, and Fern's face came\ninto focus. Her moist red lips parted, and I shivered, looking at her,\neven on a visicom screen. The shining glory of her hair, those cool\ngreen eyes. Three months hadn't made a difference.\n\n\"How was little old Earth?\" I said awkwardly.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" She was radiant. \"I'll see you for lunch.\"\n\n\"Today's grievance day. Dinner?\"\n\n\"I promised Don,\" she said demurely.\n\nI swallowed hard. \"How about the Term festival tomorrow night?\"\n\n\"Well, Don sort of asked--\"\n\nI tried to laugh it off and Fern said she'd see me later and the screen\nwent blank and I sat there shaking.\n\nThe screen flickered again. Starza's great moon face smiled at me and\nsaid sweetly, \"We're ready to start grieving.\"\n\nI picked up the time studies that were death sentences for two Terms,\nand went down the hall to ulcer gulch, the conference room.\n\nLure a termite away from his tribe. Promise him the stars. Make him bust\nhis thorax on an assembly line. He makes a wonderful worker, with\nreflexes twice as fast as a human's, but he still isn't an individual.\nEven when putting a spaceship together, he's still part of the tribe,\npart of a glowing symphony of color and motion. That's bad for\nproduction. Accent on individuality, that was the keynote. The Terms and\ntheir union representatives could argue a grievance right to the letter\nof the contract, but when it came to production standards we had them.\nTerminorb IV was ninety light-years from the system, and the Terms\ncouldn't afford a home office time and motion analyst. It wasn't worth\nit. Terms were expendable.\n\nLos Tichnat was committeeman at large for the Term local. He sat regally\nat the head of the conference table, seven gleaming chitinous feet of\nhim, with his softly pulsating antennae and faceted eyes, and said in a\nclicking, humorless voice, \"The first item is a second-stage grievance.\nBrother Nadkek, in final assembly, was laid off for one day. Reason: He\nmissed an operation. The grievance, of course, is a mere formality. You\nwill deny it.\"\n\nDave Starza winked at me from behind horn-rimmed glasses. He sat like\nsome great bland Buddha, Director of Industrial Relations, genius in\nouter psychology, ruthless, soft-spoken, anticipator of alien trends. He\nsaid in that beautiful velvet voice, \"Ordinarily, yes. In this case\nNadkek wished to ask his foreman about omitting a welding phase of the\noperation. While the suggestion was declined, Nadkek showed unmistakable\ninitiative.\" Starza stressed the word. \"We appreciate his interest in\nthe job. He will receive pay for the lost day.\"\n\nAround the table, antennae flashed amazed colors. A precedent had been\nset. Interest in the job transcended even the Contract.\n\n\"Management _sustains_ the grievance?\" Tichnat droned incredulously.\n\n\"Of course,\" Starza said.\n\nNadkek left the conference room, his antennae a puzzled mauve.\n\n\"Next,\" Starza said pontifically.\n\nThe next grievance was simply that a foreman had spoken harshly to a\nTerm. The Term resented it. In his tribe he had been a fighter, prime\nguardian of the Queen-Mother. Fighters could not be reprimanded as could\nspinners or workers.\n\nStarza and Tichnat split hairs while I dozed and thought about Fern.\n\nStarza finally promised to reprimand the foreman. It was lovely, the way\nhe thumped on the table, aflame with righteousness, his voice golden\nthunder, the martyr, hurt by Tichnat's unfairness, yet so eager to\ncompromise, to be fair. The next grievance was work standards. Starza\nlooked at me. This one mattered. This was cost.\n\nI pulled out my study proofs, said, \"Radnor, in final assembly.\nConsistently in the hole. Rating, seventy-four percent--\"\n\n\"_The operation was too tight, Jake. Admit it!_\"\n\nThe thought uncoiled darkly, thundering and reverberating in the\nhorrified caverns of my brain.\n\nA thoughtcaster. So the Guild had thoughtcasters now. The Guild had\nfinally come.\n\nI sat in the dank silence, shaking. A drop of ice crawled slowly down my\ntemple. I stared around the conference table at Starza's frown, at those\nTerm faces, the great faceted eyes.\n\n\"We gave this worker every chance,\" I said, licking my lips. \"We put him\non another operation. He still couldn't cut it. Even though we've got\nproduction to meet, we still give as many chances--\"\n\nThe thought slashed. It grew into a soundless roar.\n\n\"_Stop it, Jake! Tell them how Amalgamated, under the cloak of\nliberation, is strangling the Terms with an alien culture. Tell them\nwhat a mockery their contract really is! Tell them about that Term you\ncondemned this morning!_\"\n\nI fought it. Feeling the blood run from my lip, I fought it. I'd seen\nstrong men driven insane by a thoughtcaster within seconds. My stability\nindex was six point three. Damned high. I fought it. I got to my feet.\nThe room reeled. Those damned Term faces. The shining antennae. I\nstumbled towards the door. The thought became a whiplash of molten fury.\n\n\"_Uphold that grievance, Jake! Tell them the truth. Admit the standard\nwas impossible to meet--_\"\n\nI slammed the door. The voice stopped.\n\nMy skull was a shattered fly-wheel, a sunburst of agony. I was retching.\nI stumbled down the corridor to Psych. Fern was there. I was screaming\nat her. The Guild was here. They had thoughtcasters. My brain was\nmelting. Fern was white-faced. She had a hypo. I didn't feel it. The\nlast thing I saw was the glimmer of tears in her green eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"... the neuron flow.\" Starza's voice. \"No two alike. Like fingerprints.\nWhat a pity they can't refine the transmittal waves.\"\n\nI tried to open my eyes.\n\n\"The Guild atomized Solar's plant on Proycon,\" Carmody's voice said\nquietly. \"It's just a question of time, Dave.\"\n\n\"No,\" Starza said thoughtfully. \"Proycon was a sweatshop. I think maybe\nthey're hinting that our production standards are a trifle rough. Look,\nhis eyelids fluttered. Bet you he takes refuge in amnesia.\"\n\n\"You lose.\" My voice was an iron groan.\n\nWe were in Starza's office. Carmody peered at me with a clinical eye. \"I\ntook the liberty of narcosynthesis while you were out, Jake. You told us\nall about it. How do you feel?\"\n\nI told them how I felt, in spades.\n\n\"I want my vacation now,\" I said. \"I've accrued seven months. I'm going\nto Venus,\" I said.\n\n\"Now, now,\" Starza said. \"Mustn't desert the sinking ship, Jake.\" I shut\nmy eyes. His voice was soothing oil. \"Jake, the Guild as a whole doesn't\nknow of this plant. Guild agents are free-lancers, in the full sense of\nthe word. They exercise their own initiative, and only report to Guild\nHQ when the job is done.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Carmody said, \"if we can find out who--\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" Starza's eyes were veiled. \"Incidentally, Don, you've been\ngone the last four days. Why?\"\n\nCarmody regarded him steadily. \"Recruiting. You knew that.\"\n\n\"Yet you brought back only a dozen Terms.\"\n\nCarmody drew a slow deep breath. \"Word's gotten around, Dave. The\ntribes have finally forgotten their petty wars and united against a\ncommon enemy. Us! Any Term that exhibits undesirable traits of\nindividuality is now destroyed. I think a dozen was a good haul.\"\n\n\"You had the whole planet.\"\n\nCarmody's grin was diamond hard. \"You think maybe I spent a few hours\nunder a Guild mind-control? Is that it?\"\n\nStarza said, \"On your way out, send Los Tichnat in.\"\n\nCarmody flushed. \"Tichnat's the one and you know it! But if he's not--if\nyou haven't run down the spy by tomorrow--you can accept my resignation.\nI saw what they left of Proycon.\"\n\nThe door slammed behind him. Starza smiled at me. \"What do you think,\nJake?\"\n\n\"Tichnat. The second I got out of there, the thoughtcaster stopped.\"\n\n\"Doesn't mean a thing. They can beam through solid rock. Hundred-foot\nradius.\"\n\n\"No exploitation,\" I mused.\n\n\"Fanatics,\" Starza said. \"They'd impede the progress of man. Sacrifice\nman's rightful place in the cosmos for the sake of--crawling things!\nWe'll fight them, Jake!\"\n\nTichnat entered. He stood stiffly before Starza's desk, his antennae a\ncheerful emerald.\n\nStarza said carefully, \"What do you know about the Guild?\"\n\n\"Impractical visionaries,\" Tichnat clicked. \"Lovers of statis,\nwell-meaning fools. They approached me yesterday.\"\n\nA vein throbbed purple in Starza's forehead. Yet he kept his voice soft.\n\"And you didn't report it?\"\n\n\"And precipitate a crisis?\" Tichnat sounded amused. \"I was asked if my\npeople were being persecuted. Had I answered in the affirmative there\nmight have been repercussions, perhaps a sequel to Proycon. Oh yes, we\nknow of Proycon. Your foremen are sometimes indiscreet.\"\n\n\"Who was the agent?\" Starza breathed.\n\n\"Should I tell you, and disrupt the status quo? You would destroy the\nagent. In retaliation, the Guild might destroy this plant.\"\n\n\"Impossible! Guild agents have no such authority--\"\n\n\"A chance I cannot afford to take.\" Tichnat was adamant.\n\n\"Amalgamated,\" Starza prodded, \"offers a standing reward of one hundred\nthousand solar credits for apprehension of any Guild agent. Your village\ncould use those credits. You could equip an atomic lab. You could\nmaintain your own research staff--\"\n\n\"Stop it.\" The antennae throbbed brilliantly.\n\n\"We are your friends, Tichnat.\"\n\n\"Symbiosis, I believe is the word,\" Tichnat clicked dryly. \"You need us.\nWe need your science. We need your terrifying concept of individuality.\nWe need to lose our old ways. The dance of harvest time. The\nQueen-Mother. One by one the rituals drop away. The old life, the good\ntribal life, is dying. You sift out us misfits who chafe at tribal\noneness, you offer us the planets!\"\n\nThe antennae flashed an angry scarlet. \"You think to keep us chained a\nmillennium. A hundred years will suffice. We will leave you. We exiles\nyou have made, we who would be destroyed if we dared return to the\ntribe, we shall rule this world! You aliens drive a hard bargain, but\nthe dream is worth it!\"\n\nPrometheus, in a bug's body. The shining strength, and the dark terrible\npride.\n\n\"It is no dream,\" Starza said gently. \"But perhaps you go about\nachieving it the wrong way. You still refuse to divulge the spy?\"\n\n\"I am sorry. Good day.\"\n\nStarza brooded after him.\n\n\"He's a fool. But he's grasping mankind's concepts, Jake. I'd give my\nright eye for a good semanticist! Basic English does it. _Self_, _want_,\n_mine_, selfish ego-words, the cornerstones of grasping humanity. Sure,\nwe'll raise hell with their esthetic sense, but in the end they'll thank\nus.\"\n\nI sat, worrying about a secret fanatic somewhere in the plant who, in\nthe holy interests of Mars-for-the-Martians, Terminorb-for-the-Terms,\nmight soon plant an atomic warhead in our body shop. I finally said,\n\"What are we going to _do_?\"\n\n\"Do?\" Starza chuckled. \"Why, slacken line speeds, lower production\nstandards, fifty percent at least. By tomorrow we'll be down to forty\njobs an hour. They want loose standards, we'll give it to them.\"\n\n\"But my _cost_?\"\n\n\"Obscenity your cost. Look, Jake, no matter how you set an operation up,\nthe Terms manage to work in some glittering little ritual. They _have_\nto create beauty. Their esthetic sense must be fed. They can't adjust to\nquick change. Supposing you cut line speeds by ten per cent. They\nadjust, but it almost kills them. Then drop thirty per cent. Their\nritual loses timing, becomes discordant. What happens?\"\n\nI blinked. \"They go mad.\"\n\n\"And our little Guild saboteur will be guilty of a few Term deaths.\nHe'll have violated a basic Guild tenet. He'll go home with his tail\nbetween his legs. Catch?\"\n\nI caught.\n\nBy midafternoon we had the conveyor speeds down thirty per cent. The red\nline on my cost chart soared precariously. The entire production line\nslowed to a crawl. We waited.\n\nAt five o'clock it happened. Three Terms in the body shop went mad. It\nstarted a chain reaction throughout the trim line. Six more Terms ran\namuck and had to be destroyed. Final assembly became a shambles. Starza\ncalled me on the visicom, delighted. \"Our Guild agent played right into\nour hands, Jake. In forcing a production slump he's harming the workers.\nHis next move will probably be a bluff.\"\n\nI wasn't so sure.\n\nThat evening the executive dining room was choked with a tight, gnawing\ntension. Department heads spoke in hushed whispers, eyes darting. The\nman across the table could be a mindless-controlled, a Guild pawn. Smile\nat him politely and keep your mouth shut. I ordered _thar_, a Terminorb\narthapod that was usually more delicious than Venusian lobster, but\ntonight it tasted like broiled leather. It was like eating in a morgue.\n\nI saw Carmody, at the next table. I nodded coolly to him and he hitched\nhis chair over and said, \"By the way, Jake, I'm sorry about Harvey. He's\ngoing back to Earth next week.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"His stability index was too low,\" Carmody said smoothly. \"Sure, we\ncould have given him the works, but you didn't want a robot.\"\n\nI said deliberately, \"I needed that boy, Don.\"\n\nCarmody got up, his smile infinitely contemptuous. \"We don't all have\nyour stability index, Jake.\"\n\nI stared after him, and the thought suddenly struck me that not once had\n_I_ considered quitting, ever. Somehow, the thought disturbed me.\n\nAbruptly the public address speaker boomed.\n\n\"Attention,\" Starza's voice crackled. \"To the Guild agent, wherever he\nmay be. Today you murdered thirty-seven Terms. Is this your altruism? Is\nthis your vaunted justice?\" He went on, his voice like organ music,\nsweeping away all doubt, making you proud and glad to be a part of\nAmalgamated, part of Production, when quite suddenly his voice choked\noff. Simultaneously another voice ripped through the hall. A cold ironic\nwhisper, lashing at the mind.\n\n\"_Altruism, yes. But not as you conceive it. Today you passed your own\njudgment. You have twenty-four hours to evacuate before this Plant is\ndestroyed. The verdict is final._\"\n\nThe dining hall echoed with moans. Hands leaned to agonized temples. The\nthoughtcaster again, on a wide band frequency. Through the pain I was\nconscious of Starza's voice. The Guild was trying to bluff us. We\nwouldn't let them. I stumbled out of the hall, my teeth chattering, took\nthe lift down to the first level, and got outside, to walk free in the\npark.\n\nHere was Eden. Giant conifers and ferns wove a cool green pattern of\ndelight, and the laughter of the crystal fountains soothed. Terms had\nfashioned this garden, had created a poem in living green, a quiet fugue\nof _oneness_, each leaf blending exquisitely with the next, the unity,\nthe perfect whole. For one weak moment I let the pattern seep\ninsidiously into me, and then, ashamed, focused my eyes on that jarring\nsplash of white in the center of the garden. The ten-foot model of the\nAmalgamated X-3M, squat with power, lifting on her stern jets. A symbol\nof Amalgamated's strength, the indomitable spirit of mankind, beauty\nborn of pure utility. Oddly, a half-remembered poem of the Ancients\nflitted through my brain:\n\n    _Dirty British Coaster with her salt-caked smokestack,\n    Butting through the Channel on the mad March days--_\n\nThat was man.\n\nOn an infinity of planets he had met resistance, through force, through\nguile--even through beauty. And he had conquered. I drew a slow deep\nbreath and sat on one of the benches, staring up at the gigantic\nhorseshoe of the factory, hearing the muted hum of the atomics.\nTwenty-four hours.\n\nI tried to run through my axioms, and I was suddenly terrified. I\ncouldn't remember them! That damned thoughtcaster. Twice in one day.\nPerhaps there was some gradual neural disintegration. My head hurt\nterribly. Tomorrow I'd go to Psych for a checkup. I thought about that\nmarble villa in Venusport, and about my bank account. Not enough.\nAnother year, just one more year, and I could retire, at thirty-four. I\nthought about the Venusian twilights, and the turquoise mists off the\nDeeps, and wondered dully if I'd ever see Venus or the Earth again.\n\nI saw Fern, walking among the conifers, her face a pale mask of strain.\n\"You heard it, Jake?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\nWe sat in the aquamarine twilight, and Fern was shivering, and I put my\narm around her.\n\n\"Looks like altruism is a relative thing,\" I said. \"What _do_ they\nwant?\"\n\n\"Uncontaminated Terms,\" she said bitterly. \"No science, no stars, no\nwars and no progress. A big beautiful planet-mind, the Term mind,\nforever static, forever dead.\"\n\n\"It's a bluff,\" I said. \"Our little fanatic's stalling for time, hoping\nto stampede us while he finds another way.\"\n\n\"For example?\"\n\n\"Why do you think we insist on basic English for all Terms? Supposing a\nforeman should start jabbering Terminese during an operation. The Terms\nwould revert, we'd have a line shutdown. They can't adjust--say!\" A\nrandom thought was nibbling at my brain. \"Where was Carmody this\nmorning? Just before I reeled in?\"\n\nHer fine brows knitted. \"Why, he went--oh, Jake, surely you don't\nthink--?\"\n\n\"Went where?\"\n\n\"Down the hall. Towards Personnel.\"\n\n\"Towards the conference hall, you mean. He never even examined Harvey!\"\n\n\"It wasn't necessary,\" she said uncomfortably. \"Don just wanted to\nverify his stability index.\"\n\n\"Sure! So he stood outside the conference hall and put a whammy on me--\"\n\nFern was smiling. I scowled. \"It fits. It has to be him.\"\n\n\"Or Tichnat,\" she said. \"Or Starza. Or me.\"\n\nI stared at her. \"You'd do.\" My voice shook. \"You were gone three\nmonths. They could have got to you.\"\n\nHer rich, warm laughter sifted through the twilight, and I wanted to hit\nher. \"They did,\" she gurgled, \"but I've decided to relent, Jake. I'll\nspare the plant on one condition--that you take me to the Term festival\ntomorrow night.\"\n\nI grunted. \"Carmody working overtime, I suppose?\"\n\n\"If the plant's still standing.\"\n\nI changed the subject.\n\nTwo hours later Starza called a council of war.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe conference room was crammed with quivering executives. Starza\ncarefully let the tension build to a shrill crescendo before he said:\n\n\"One of you gentlemen is a Guild mindless-controlled.\"\n\nRagged silence. Starza's smile was very faint.\n\n\"You gave us an ultimatum. But destroying this plant is an admission of\nfailure you're not willing to make--yet. You'll try another tack. You're\njust beginning to discover that this environment we've created for the\nTerms is superior to the primitive jungle. Tichnat!\"\n\nTichnat stepped forward. His antennae were a proud, brilliant gold.\n\n\"Do you want a shutdown?\" Starza asked softly.\n\n\"Are we fools?\" Tichnat clicked. \"To lose what we've gained? To return\nto our tribe? To be destroyed?\"\n\nStarza's calm gaze caressed each face, probing. \"You see? Stalemate.\nWhoever you are, _you're bluffing_. Tomorrow our conveyor speeds return\nto normal. You'll do nothing. You may try to agitate the Terms, but\nthey're satisfied--\"\n\nOne of the superintendents cleared his throat. \"Look,\" he said\nunsteadily, \"sometimes you can't afford to call a bluff.\"\n\nStarza said pleasantly, \"Any resignations will be accepted right now.\nYou can wait safely in the Term village until next week's freighter\narrives. No repercussions, I promise.\"\n\nThe lie was blatant. Carmody stood by the door, his smile strained. It\nwas all too obvious what would happen to any resignees.\n\n\"None?\" Starza's brows rose. \"I'm proud of you. That's it, gentlemen.\"\n\nThe next day was a frenetic nightmare. My cost dropped, but it didn't\nmatter. That was one day when the best company man became a\nclock-watcher. Line foremen, department heads, cracked under the strain,\nand were summarily removed to Psych. Carmody and staff worked overtime.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI toiled feverishly over operation schedules, the crazily fluctuating\ncost charts. My headache was gone, but I still couldn't remember my\naxioms! I felt guilty over not going to Psych, but there just wasn't the\ntime.\n\nHell, _I'd_ never needed indoctrination. I was an Amalgamated man\nthrough and through. Finally I grabbed an engineering manual, leafed\nangrily through it--and sat there, empty and shaking.\n\nI'd gone insane.\n\nThe words were gibberish. Oh, I could read them all right, but they\ndidn't make _sense_. What a filthy trick. Semantic block, Starza would\ncall it. I kept staring at the meaningless words, conscious of a tearing\nsense of loss. And I wanted to cry.\n\nSix o'clock was zero hour.\n\nSix o'clock came, and the factory held its collective breath while\nnothing happened.\n\nAt six-thirty Starza made a long speech over the public address. About\nthe selfless spirit of man, helping the Terms reach the stars, about how\nwe would never admit defeat, and about how, after tonight, the Term\nfestival would be discontinued. The Terms had adopted mankind's culture,\nthey had no further need of their effete native customs.\n\nAt seven, Fern and I were walking past Administration towards the\nlighted square-mile enclosure of the Term village. Fern had never seen a\nfestival.\n\n\"A throwback,\" I said, \"to their old tribal days. Their harvest, when\nthey pay tribute to the Queen-Mother and pray for good crops and work\nwell done. It's their yearly substitute for _Stammverstand_. Back in the\nnative villages, whenever a Term's in trouble, he goes to the council\nhut and the others join him in a silent, group telepathy. But we've just\nabout weaned them, angel! They'll be individuals soon.\"\n\nWe walked down the deserted row of Term huts, past the council hall, to\nthe great stone amphitheatre, and sat with the other execs. Fern was\nvery gay and cheerful, but I kept thinking about my axioms, trying to\nbring them back to life. I felt dead, all dead inside.\n\nStarza came up, frowning, and I congratulated him.\n\n\"It's too pat, Jake, it worries me. Where's Carmody?\"\n\n\"Setting up those semantic reaction tests you gave him,\" Fern said.\n\n\"But I never gave him--\"\n\nAbruptly the lights snuffed out. At one end of the arena loomed a\ntwelve-foot statue of a bloated Term, limned in a soft pale glow. The\nQueen-Mother.\n\nThe hush. Then the radiance.\n\nSlowly the Terms filed into the arena, rank upon rank of living flame.\nFirst the fighters, their antennae shining crimson and splendid against\nthe tall night. Then the twins glows of blue that denoted the spinners,\nthe weavers. The golden blaze of the harvesters. The lambent colors\ncrept through the air like a mood, like a dream, and deepened into a\nshimmering cataract of rainbow fire, a paean of light and glory that\nwhirled and spun in a joyous rhythm as old as the race itself.\n\nThen--chaos.\n\nA blinding flare cascaded from the six-foot antennae of the statue. The\nradiance grew, brighter than an atomic flare, more terrible than the\nsun. The Terms stood frozen. Beside me, Starza swore.\n\nThis wasn't in the script.\n\nThat colossal voice.\n\nEar-snapping clicks, and liquid vowels. Terminese. The forbidden tongue.\nThe voice blared. I caught most of it.\n\n\"_Children, you have sinned. You are defiled with the taint of alien\nmonsters. You have failed the Queen-Mother. Return, my children, return\nto your tribes. Return to the tabernacle of unity, the one-in-all, the\nQueen-Mother! For in death there is life, and there is joy in\nimmolation. Return!_\"\n\nLastly, the climax. That last shattering hunk of propaganda that would\nhave been so tritely amusing if it hadn't been so terrifying.\n\n\"_You have nothing to lose but your chains._\"\n\nThe giant antennae faded to a liquid silver. The silver of hope, of\nforgiveness.\n\nFor a moment I was blind. I felt Fern trembling against me. The execs\nwere chattering like frightened sheep. Then I could see. I saw Starza.\nHe was moving down the aisle, cursing in a tight, dull monotone.\n\nI followed him down into the arena. The Terms stood shriveled, mute.\nStarza was fumbling at the base of the statue, and he said in a thick\nhorrible voice, \"Look.\" The loudspeaker. The coiled wiring.\n\nThe Terms stirred.\n\nStarza leaped to the lap of the statue. He bawled, \"Listen! This is\nsacrilege! You have been victims of a hoax--\"\n\nNot listening, they filed in silent groups out of the arena. Their\nantennae were the color of ashes. Starza jumped down. He pounded after\nthem. He was shouting at Los Tichnat.\n\n\"I know,\" Tichnat droned. He kept walking. \"You are right. It does not\nmatter that you are right. The Queen-Mother called.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Starza mouthed. \"It was a fraud, a trick. You can't--\"\n\n\"We must.\" Tichnat paused. For a long moment the great faceted eyes\nstared somberly. \"It was a splendid dream, the thing you offered us. But\nthis is the final reality. And yours is but a dream.\"\n\nHe tramped stolidly on, after the others. The council hall door closed.\n\nStarza clawed at the door. It opened. He was too late. They sat silently\naround the great table, the faceted eyes dead, the antennae coruscating\nindigo, now green, now rose. Communion. The meshing of minds. Starza\nshouted at them. Stillness.\n\nStarza looked blindly at me. He was shaking. \"Carmody,\" he said.\n\"Carmody knows the Term mind. He can do something. Come on,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe found Carmody in his quarters, methodically packing. His eyebrows\nrose as we burst in. \"Did you gentlemen ever try knocking?\"\n\nStarza just looked at him. Carmody drew a long breath. \"You'll find my\nresignation on your desk, Dave.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Starza's voice was very soft.\n\n\"It's only a question of time,\" Carmody said. \"Call it the rat deserting\nthe ship if you like, but I'm through.\"\n\nStarza was smiling, a fat man's smile. \"So you really think you can pull\nit off,\" he whispered.\n\nCarmody shrugged, and Starza calmly took out a sonic pistol and shot him\nin the belly.\n\nA sonic blast hemorrhages. It rends the capillaries, ploughs the flesh\ninto a flaccid collection of shattered nerve fibers and ruined arteries.\nIt's a rotten way to die.\n\nStarza watched Carmody thrash himself to death on the floor. I turned\naway.\n\n\"For the record, Jake, he made a full confession. We both heard him.\"\n\n\"Just for the record,\" I said.\n\n\"It had to be him,\" Starza said. \"That thoughtcaster blast yesterday\nmorning made reference to your study on the Term. Only Harvey and\nCarmody knew about that. It couldn't have been Harvey. He cut his throat\nthis morning.\n\n\"I've decided,\" Starza said. \"This is a Type L planet, after all. The\nnatives are chronically unstable. Hostile, in fact. Pursuant to Solar\nRegulation 3, we have the right to enforce martial law. It should be six\nmonths before an investigation. Meanwhile--\"\n\n\"We'll get production,\" I said.\n\n\"We'll get production.\" He wiped his forehead, relaxed. \"I'll send in a\nfull report tonight. Better turn in, Jake,\" he said kindly. \"I'll need\nyou in the morning.\"\n\nI turned in.\n\nYou lie awake, staring into the blackness. It gnaws.\n\nMy head throbbed. I should have felt a triumphant relief, but I could\nnot remember my axioms, and I felt a sick dull hate for the thing the\nGuild spy Carmody had done to me. What happens when you strip a man of\neverything he believes in?\n\nHe remembers other things.\n\nThose memories came trooping back like ghosts and I fought them,\nsweating, but they came. Once upon a time, there was a starry-eyed young\nengineer who started out to set the galaxy on fire. But he got\nsqueamish, somewhere along the way. So Carmody operated on him. Carmody\ndid things to his brain, made a good production man out of him.\n\nI remembered now.\n\nThat time I had argued with Starza about standards, nine years ago. And\nI had resigned. And Starza sent me to Psych.\n\nGood old Carmody.\n\nThere never would be a white marble villa on Venus. It was a harmless\ndream, a substitute for what I had lost. But it didn't matter! Those\nsuperimposed patterns had been removed, that thoughtcaster had crippled\nmy thinking, but, by Heaven, I was still an Amalgamated man! They\ncouldn't take that away.\n\nBut Starza had been wrong about Carmody.\n\nNothing definite. But when you dedicate your life into extrapolating\ncurves, frozen chunks of time and motion, into the thunder of jets\nlifting Amalgamated ships from Terminorb, your mind becomes a very\nefficient analogue computor, if you know how to use. I used it now. I\nfed little things, facts, variables, into that computor, and it told me\nthree times. Probability: sixty percent at least.\n\nI got up, dressed stiffly. I was trembling. I could still serve, after\nall.\n\nI took the lift up to Administration, and walked down that long gray\ncorridor on leaden feet towards the illuminated rectangle of Starza's\noffice.\n\nI opened the door.\n\n\"Hello, darling,\" Fern said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was unhurriedly burning Starza's report. Starza sat mutely in his\nchair, head tilted back at an impossible angle, staring at nothing.\n\n\"It had to be you.\" I had never felt so tired. \"You would have destroyed\nthe plant, wouldn't you? Only I showed you another way. Make the Terms\nrevert. And you had that hypo all ready when I reeled into Psych.\" I\nmoved towards her carefully. \"You're so damned altruistic. A Guild\nmindless-controlled,\" I said.\n\nFern's smile was compassionate. She methodically ground the ashes to\npowder, lifted that calm green gaze.\n\n\"Stupid words to frighten children, Jake. Yes, they kidnapped me. I\nnever reached Earth, three months ago. I was indoctrinated--oh, they\ndidn't have far to go. _Each race to its own fulfillment._\" Her eyes\nwere shining. \"Look out the window.\"\n\nNumbly, I moved past her. I stared. In the distant blackness, a column\nof living flame flickered up the slope of Cobalt Mountain. Ice-green,\nruby, silver and blue. The Terms were leaving.\n\n\"They're not ready for individuality yet,\" Fern breathed. \"In a million\nyears perhaps. Not now. They're going home.\"\n\n\"To die.\"\n\n\"The race will live. Individuality isn't the penultimate, darling.\nYou'll find out.\" I moved towards her. \"You've got a very tough mind,\nJake. You'll make a wonderful Guild agent--\"\n\nI got both hands on her throat.\n\nFern moved. Her right arm was a snake striking, and a steel strength\nlifted me, turning, against one and a half gravities, and the floor\nwavered up to hit me in the face. Something broke. I tasted blood.\n\nThrough the agony, I moved. I crawled towards her.\n\n\"They gave me six weeks of hand combat under two gravs,\" she said. \"Soon\nyou'll be one of us, Jake. One of the Guild!\"\n\nI stared up at her in a dull horror. I kept crawling.\n\n\"We'll heal you,\" Fern said. \"We'll give you back the dream. We may even\nwork together! Maybe I'll fall in love with you again, who knows?\" Her\neyes were brimming. She took out a sonic pistol. \"It's all right,\ndarling. I'll adjust it for knockout. In three hours we'll be on a Guild\nflier. Please, darling,\" she said, and I kept crawling. And Fern's smile\nwas a benediction as she pulled the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Exploiter's End, by James Causey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EXPLOITER'S END ***\n\n***** This file should be named 40970.txt or 40970.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/0/9/7/40970/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
