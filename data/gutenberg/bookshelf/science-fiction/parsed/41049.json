We therefore might really have had our home dim ages ago, on\nworlds distantly removed from our earth.\n\nThe ability to travel the interstellar spaces, however, might also be\npossessed by other creatures--creatures driven by fear, necessity and by\nthe will to conquer. And if they come, in mighty waves, with scientific\npowers far beyond us, to dominate the earth, a terrible time will face\nthe puny human race.\n\nAnd in this story they do come, and provoke some of the strangest and\nmost exciting adventures that have yet been recorded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE ONSLAUGHT FROM RIGEL\n\n\nMurray Lee woke abruptly, with the memory of the sound that had roused\nhim drumming at the back of his head, though his conscious mind had been\nbeyond its ambit. His first sensation was an overpowering stiffness in\nevery muscle--a feeling as though he had been pounded all over, though\nhis memory supplied no clue to the reason for such a sensation.\n\nPainfully, he turned over in bed and felt the left elbow where the ache\nseemed to center. He received the most tremendous shock of his life. The\nmotion was attended by a creaking clang and the elbow felt exceedingly\nlike a complex wheel.\n\nHe sat up to make sure he was awake, tossing the offending arm free of\nthe covers. The motion produced another clang and the arm revealed\nitself to his astonished gaze as a system of metal bands, bound at the\nelbow by the mechanism he had felt before, and crowned, where the\nfingers should be, by steely talons terminating in rubber-like\nfinger-tips. Yet there seemed to be no lack of feeling in the member.\nFor a few seconds he stared, open-mouthed, then lifted the other arm. It\nwas the right-hand counterpart of the device he had been gazing at. He\nessayed to move one, then the other--the shining fingers obeyed his\nthought as though they were flesh and blood.\n\nA sense of expectant fear gripped him as he lifted one of the hands to\nunbutton his pajamas. He was not deceived in the half-formed\nexpectation; where the ribs clothed in a respectable amount of muscle\nshould have been, a row of glistening metal plates appeared. Thoughts of\nbody-snatching and bizarre surgery flitted through his mind to be\ninstantly dismissed. Dreaming? Drunk? A dreadful idea that he might be\ninsane struck him and he leaped from the bed to confront a mirror. His\nfeet struck the floor with a portentous bang and each step produced a\nsqueak and clank--and he faced the mirror, the familiar mirror before\nwhich he had shaved for years. With utter stupefaction he saw an iron\ncountenance, above which a stiff brush of wire hair projected\nludicrously.\n\nOne does not go mad at such moments. The shock takes time to sink in.\n\"At all events I may as well get dressed,\" he remarked to himself\npractically. \"I don't suppose water will do this hardware any good, so\nI'll omit the bath; but if I'm crazy I might as well go out and have a\ngood time about it.\"\n\nDressing was a process prolonged by an examination of himself and the\ndiscovery that he was a most efficient metal machine. He rather admired\nthe smoothness of the hip joints and the way the sliding parts of his\narms fitted together, and was agreeably surprised to find that in the\nmetallizing process his toes had become prehensile. Just for the fun of\nit, he pulled one shoe on with the opposite foot.\n\nIt was not until he was nearly dressed that he realized that the wonted\nnoise of New York, which reached one as a throaty undertone at the\nforty-eighth story of a modern apartment building, was somehow absent.\nSurely, at this hour--he glanced at the clock. It had stopped at a\nquarter to two. No help there. His watch was inexplicably missing.\nProbably Ben had borrowed it.... Ah!\n\nThat was the idea. Ben Ruby, with whom he occupied the duplex apartment\nin the penthouse of the Arbuckle Building, was a scientist of sorts\n(mainly engaged in the analysis of \"booze\" samples for millionaires\ndistrustful of their bootleggers, these days)--he would be able to\nexplain everything.\n\nHe stepped across to the door and dropped the brass knocker, a little\ntimorous at the sound of his own thudding steps. The door was snatched\nopen with unexpected suddenness by a caricature of Ben in metal--as\ncomplete a machine as himself, but without most of the clothes.\n\n\"Come in! Come in!\" his friend bellowed in a voice with an oddly\nphonographic quality to it. \"You look great. Iron Man MacGinnity! What\ndid you put on clothes for? As useful as pants on a rock-drill. I have\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"What is it? Am I crazy, are you, or are we both?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Greatest thing that ever happened. The big comet. They\nsaid she was radioactive, but most of 'em wouldn't believe it. Now look\nwhat it did.\" (Murray Lee remembered vaguely some newspaper palaver\nabout a giant comet that was going to strike the earth--argument and\ncounter-argument as to whether it would have a serious effect.)\n\"Everybody's turned to metal; nize machinery, ate oop all de\naxle-grease. You need oil. Stick around.\"\n\nHe disappeared into the bowels of the apartment, the sound of his\nfootsteps ringing enormous in the vast silence. In an instant he was\nback with a radio battery in one hand and an oil-can in the other.\n\n\"Sorry, no grease on tap,\" he remarked briskly. \"Typewriter oil.\" He\nwent to work busily, squirting drops of oil into Lee's new metallic\njoints. \"Connect this thing up yourself. It fills you with what it\ntakes.\" He indicated the battery with an extended toe. \"One arm and the\nopposite leg. There seems to be a resistance chamber in us somewhere\nthat collects the juice.\"\n\nWithout in the least understanding what it was all about, Murray Lee\nmade shift to follow his instruction. It was the most singular meal he\nhad ever partaken of, but he found it curiously invigorating.\n\n\"How about another? No? Have you seen anybody else? It finished most of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Will you sit down and tell me consecutively what it's all about before\nI bash you?\" asked Murray, petulantly. \"Being turned into a machine is\nnot the easiest thing in the world on one's temper; it upsets the\ndisposition.\"\n\n\"Some sort of a special extra radioactive gas storm connected with the\ncomet, I think, though I can't be sure. It's made machines of all of us,\nnow and forever more. We'll live on electric current after this and\nwon't have to bother about little things like doctors if we can find a\ngood mechanic. But it killed a lot of people. Come along, I'll show\nyou.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis hand rang on Murray's arm as he grasped it to lead the way. The hall\nwas portentously dark, and Ben pulled him straight across it to the door\nmarked \"Fire Exit.\"\n\n\"Elevator?\" queried Murray.\n\n\"No go. No power.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, forty-eight stories to walk.\"\n\n\"You'll get used to it.\" They were clanking to the landing of the floor\nbelow and Ben, without the slightest compunction, pushed boldly into the\ndoor of the apartment there. The lock showed signs of being forced. \"Oh,\nI broke it in,\" Ben answered Murray's unspoken query. \"Thought I might\nbe able to help, but it was no use. That fat woman lives here--you know,\nthe one that used to sniff at us in the elevator when we went on a\nbender.\"\n\nAny qualms Murray felt about looking on the naked face of death were\nperfunctorily laid to rest as the scientist led him into the room\noccupied by the late lady of the elevator. She lay solidly in her bed\namidst the meretricious gorgeousness she had affected in life, the\nweight of her body sagging the bed grotesquely toward its center.\nInstead of the clean-running mechanical devices which marked the\nappearance of the two friends, she was nothing but lumps and bumps, a\nbulging, ugly cast-iron statue, distending the cheap \"silk\" nightdress.\n\n\"See?\" said Ben, calmly. \"The transmutation wasn't complete. Prob'ly\ndidn't get it as strong as we did. Look, the window's closed. This will\nbe a warning to people who are afraid to sleep in a draft. Come along.\"\n\nMurray lingered. \"Isn't there anything ... we can do?\" He felt\nuncomfortably responsible.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" said Ben, cheerfully. \"All she's good for is to stand\nin the park and look at. Come along. We've got a lot of stairs to go\ndown ... we're too noisy; need a good bath in non-rusting oil.\"\n\nThey reached the street level after an \u00e6on of stairs, Ben leading the\nway to the corner drug store. All about them was a complete silence;\nfleecy white clouds sailed across the little ribbon of blue visible at\nthe top of the canyon of the New York city street.\n\n\"Lucky it's a nice day,\" said Ben, boldly stepping into the drug store,\nthe door of which stood open. \"We'll have to figure out this rainy\nweather thing. It's going to present a problem.\"\n\nWithin, the drug store presented the same phenomena of arrested\ndevelopment as the apartment of the fat lady at the forty-seventh story.\nA cast-iron statue of a soda-clerk leaned on the fountain in an attitude\nof studied negligence, its lips parted as though addressing some words\nto the equally metallic figure of a girl which faced him across the\ncounter. On her steely features was a film of power, and the caked and\ncurling remains of her lip stick showed she had been there for some\ntime.\n\n\"By the way,\" Murray asked, \"have you any idea what day it is, and how\nlong we were--under the influence? It couldn't have happened overnight.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" came Ben's voice from the rear of the store. \"Say, old dear,\nrummage around some of those drawers for rubber gloves, will you? I'd\nhate to run into high voltage with this outfit.\"\n\n\"Ah, here they are,\" came from Ben finally. \"Well, let's go.\"\n\n\"What's the next step?\" They were outside.\n\n\"Rubber shoes, I fancy,\" said Ben, as his feet skidded on the pavement.\n\"Let's take a taxi there and go find a shoe store.\"\n\nTogether they managed to slide the cast-iron taxi driver from his seat\n(Murray was surprised at how easily he was able to lift a weight he\ncould not have budged in his flesh and blood days), deposited him on the\ncurb and climbed in. The key was fortunately in the switch.\n\nAs they swung around the corner into Madison Avenue, Lee gave an\nexclamation. A scene of ruin and desolation met their eyes. Two or three\nstreet cars had telescoped and an auto or so had piled into the\nwreckage. All about were the iron forms of the passengers in these\nconveyances, frozen in the various attitudes they had assumed at the\nmoment of the change, and from one or two of them thin streamers of\nmetal showed where blood had flowed forth before it had been\nirretrievably crystallized to metal.\n\nMurray Lee suddenly realized that an enormous amount of machinery had\ngone to smash everywhere when the guiding hands had been removed and the\nguiding brains frozen to useless metal. He gave a little shudder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey swung round before a shoe store with grating brakes. The door was\nlocked, but Ben, lifting his foot, calmly kicked a hole in the show\nwindow. Murray extended a restraining hand, but his friend shook it off.\n\n\"No use asking permission. If the proprietor of this place is still\nalive anywhere, it will be easy enough to settle up for the damage; if\nhe isn't, we have as good a right to it as anybody.\"\n\nThe new toes, which appeared to be longer than those he remembered, made\nfitting a difficulty, and Murray split two or three shoes before he got\na pair on.\n\n\"What next?\" he asked. \"I feel like a drink.\"\n\n\"No use,\" said Ben. \"You're on the wagon for good. Alcohol would play\nmerry hell with your metalwork. The best thing is to find out how many\npeople we are. For all we know, we're the only ones in the world. This\nthing seems to have knocked out everybody along the street level. Let's\ntry some of the taller apartment buildings and see if we can find more\npenthouse dwellers.\"\n\n\"Or maybe the others came to before us and went away,\" offered Murray.\n\n\"True,\" Ben replied. \"Anyhow, look-see.\" He led the way to the taxi.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Murray. \"What's that?\"\n\nAbove the sound of the starting engine came the echo of heavy footsteps,\nmuffled by shoes.\n\n\"Hey! Coo-ee! This way!\" shouted Ben. The footsteps tentatively\napproached the corner. Murray ran forward, then stopped in amazement.\nThe newcomer was a girl--or would have been a girl had she not been all\nmetal and machinery like themselves. To his eyes, still working on\nflesh-and-blood standards, she was anything but good-looking. She was\nfully and formally dressed, save that she wore no hat--the high pile of\ntangled wire that crowned her head made this obviously impossible.\n\n\"Oh, what _has_ happened?\" she cried at them. \"What can I do? I took a\ndrink of water and it hurt.\"\n\n\"Everything's all right. Just a little metal transformation,\" said Ben.\n\"Stick around, I'll get you some oil. You squeak.\" He was off down the\nstreet in a clatter, leaving Murray with the newcomer.\n\n\"Permit me to introduce myself,\" he offered. \"I am--or was--Murray Lee.\nMy friend, who has gone to get you some oil, is Benjamin Franklin Ruby.\nHe thinks the big comet which hit the earth contained radioactive gas\nthat made us all into metal. Did you live in a penthouse?\"\n\nShe eyed him darkly. \"Somebody told you,\" she said, \"I'm Gloria\nRutherford, and we have the top floor of the Sherry-Netherland, but all\nthe rest were away when this happened.... Oh, pardon me, it hurts me to\ntalk.\"\n\nThere came a crash from down the street, indicating that Ben was forcing\nanother store, and in a minute he was back with a handful of bottles.\nWith a flourish he offered one to the girl. \"Only castor, but it's the\nbest the market affords,\" he said. \"What we need is a good garage, but\nthere aren't many around here.... Go ahead, drink her down, it's all\nright,\" he assured the girl, who was contemplating the bottle in her\nhand with an expression of distaste.\n\nFollowing his own recommendation, he tipped up one of the bottles and\ndrank a deep draught, then calmly proceeded to douse himself from head\nto foot with the remainder.\n\nShe made a little grimace, then tried it. \"Thank you,\" she said, setting\nthe bottle down. \"I didn't think it was possible anybody could like the\nstuff except in a magazine ad. Now tell me, where are all the other\npeople and what do we do?\"\n\n\"Do?\" queried Ben. \"Find 'em. How? Ask Mr. Foster. Anybody else in your\nneck of the woods?\"\n\nShe shook her head. Murray noticed that the joints of her neck rattled.\n\"Paulson--that's my maid--was the only other person in our apartment,\nand she seems to be even more solid-iron in the head than usual--like\nthis lot.\" She swung her hand round in an expressive gesture toward the\nimage of a policeman which was directing two similar images to pause at\nthe curb.\n\n\"How about a bonfire?\" suggested Murray. \"That's the way the Indians or\nSouth Africans or somebody, attract attention.\"\n\n\"What could we burn?\" asked Ben. \"... A building, of course. Why not?\nProperty doesn't mean anything any more with all the property owners\ndead.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Gloria Rutherford, falling into the spirit of his\nsuggestion. \"The old Metropolitan Opera. That eyesore has worried me for\nthe last five years.\"\n\nThe suggestion was endorsed with enthusiasm. They climbed into the taxi\nand twenty minutes later were hilariously kindling a blaze in the\nback-stage section of the old building, running out of it with childish\ndelight to watch the pillar of smoke grow and spread as the flames\ncaught the timbers, long dry with age.\n\nMurray sighed as they sat on the curb across the street. \"This is the\nonly time I've ever been as close as I wanted to be to a big fire,\" he\ncomplained, \"and now there isn't even a policeman around for me to make\nfaces at. But such is life!\"\n\n\"What if it sets fire to the whole city?\" inquired Gloria practically.\n\nBen shrugged. \"What if?\" he replied. \"Doesn't mean anything. Bet there\naren't more than a couple of dozen people alive. But I don't think it\nwill. Modern construction in most of these places is too fireproof.\"\n\n\"Look, there's a bird,\" said Gloria, indicating a solid metal sparrow,\nfixed, like the human inhabitants of the city, in his last position in\nlife at the edge of the curb. \"By the way, what do we eat? Do we live on\ncastor oil all the time?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA Metal Community\n\n\nThe conversation turned into a discussion of the possibilities of their\nnew form. Whether they would need sleep was a moot point, and they were\ndiscussing the advisability of training mechanics as doctors when the\nfirst footsteps announced themselves.\n\nThey belonged to a man whose face, ornamented by a neat Van Dyke in\nwire, gave him the appearance of a physician of the more fleshly life,\nbut who turned out to be a lawyer, named Roberts. He was delighted with\nthe extraordinary youthfulness and vitality he felt in the new\nincarnation. Fully dressed in morning clothes, he bore the information\nthat he was one of a group of four who had achieved the metal\ntransformation atop the French building. He promptly plunged into a\ndiscussion of technicalities with Ben that left the other two out of it,\nand they moved off to the Seventh Avenue side of the building to see\nwhether any more people were visible.\n\n\"Do you miss the people much?\" asked Murray, by way of making\nconversation.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" she confessed. \"My chief emotion is delight over not having\nto go to the de la Poers' tea tomorrow afternoon. Though I suppose we\nwill miss them as time goes on.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" Murray replied. \"Life was getting pretty\ncomplicated and artificial--at least for me. There were so many things\none had to do before one began living--you know, picking the proper\nfriends and all that.\"\n\nThe girl nodded understandingly. \"I know what you mean. My mother would\nthrow a fit if she knew I were here talking to you right now. If I met\nyou at a dance in Westchester it would be perfectly all right for me to\nstay out with you half the night and drink gin together, but meeting you\nin daylight on the street--oh, boy!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Murray sighed, \"that tripe is all through with now. What do you\nsay we get back and see how the rest are getting along?\"\n\nThey found them still in the midst of their argument.\n\n\"--evidently some substance so volatile that the mere contact with\nanimal tissue causes a reaction that leaves nothing of either the\nelement or the tissue,\" Ben was saying. \"You note that these metal bands\nreproduce the muscles almost perfectly.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the lawyer replied, \"but they are too flexible to be any metal I\nknow. I'm willing to grant your wider knowledge of chemistry, but it\ndoesn't seem reasonable. All I can think of is that some outside agency\nhas interfered. These joints, for instance--,\" he touched Ben's elbow,\n\"--and what about the little rubber pads on your fingers and toes and\nthe end of your nose?\"\n\nThere was a universal motion on the part of the others to feel of their\nnoses. It was as the lawyer had said--they were, like the fingers and\ntoes, certainly very much like rubber--and movable!\n\n\"Don't know,\" said Ben. \"Who did it, though? That's what boggles your\nscheme. Everybody's changed to metal and nobody left to make the changes\nyou mention. However, let's go get the rest of your folks. I wonder if\nwe ought to have weapons. You two wait here.\"\n\nHe clanked off with the lawyer to the taxi. A moment later, the tooting\nof the horn announced their return. The party consisted, beside Roberts\nhimself, of his daughter, Ola Mae, a girl of sixteen, petulant over the\nfact that her high-heeled shoes were already breaking down under her\nweight; a Japanese servant named Yoshio; and Mrs. Roberts, one of those\ntall and billowy women of the earlier life who, to the irritation of the\nmen, turned out to be the strongest of any of them. Fat, apparently, had\nno metallic equivalent, and her ample proportions now consisted of bands\nof metal that made her extraordinarily powerful.\n\nWith these additions the little group adjourned to Times Square to watch\nthe billowing clouds of smoke rising above the ruins of the opera house.\n\n\"What next?\" asked Gloria, seating herself on the curbstone.\n\n\"Look for more people,\" said Murray. \"Surely we can't be the only frogs\nin the puddle.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" put in Ben, argumentatively, with a swing of his arm toward\nthe wreckage-strewn square. \"You forget that this catastrophe has\nprobably wiped out all the animal life of the world, and we seven owe\nour survival to some fortunate chance.\"\n\nThe Japanese touched him on the arm. \"Perhaps sir can inform inquirer,\nin such case, what is curious avian object?\" he said, pointing upward.\n\nThey heard the beat of wings as he spoke and looked up together to see,\nsoaring fifty feet past their heads a strange parody of a bird, with\nfour distinct wings, a long feathered tail, and bright intelligent eyes\nset in a dome-like head.\n\nThere was a moment of excited babbling.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Never saw anything like it before.\"\n\n\"Did the comet do _that_ to chickens?\" And then, as the strange creature\ndisappeared among the forest of spires to the east, the voice of the\nlawyer, used to such tumults, asserted its mastery over the rest.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that whatever that bird is, the first thing to be\ndone is find a headquarters of some kind and establish a mode of life.\"\n\n\"How about finding more people?\" asked Gloria. \"The more the\nmerrier--and there may be some who don't know how nice castor oil is.\"\nShe smiled a metallic smile.\n\n\"The fire--\" began Ben.\n\n\"It would keep some people away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey debated the point for several minutes, finally deciding that since\nthose present had all come from the top floors or penthouses of tall\nbuildings, the search should be confined to such localities. Each was to\ntake a car--there were any number for the taking around Times\nSquare--and cover a certain section of the city, rallying at sundown to\nthe Times building, where Ola Mae and Murray, who could not drive, were\nto be left.\n\nRoberts was the first one back, swinging a big Peugeot around with the\nskill of a racing driver. He had found no one, but had a curious tale.\nIn the upper floors of the New Waldorf three of the big windows were\nsmashed in, and in one corner of the room, amid a maze of chairs\nfantastically torn as though by a playful giant, a pile of soft cloths.\nIn the midst of this pile, four big eggs reposed. He had picked up one\nof the eggs, and after weighing the advisability of bringing it with\nhim, decided he had more important things to do. The owners of the nest\ndid not appear.\n\nAs he emerged from the building, however, the quick motion of a shadow\nacross the street caused him to look up in time to catch a glimpse of\none of the four-winged birds they had seen before, and just as he was\ndriving the car away, his ears were assailed by a torrent of screeches\nand \"skrawks\" from the homecomer. He did not look up until the shadow\nfell across him again when he perceived the bird was following close\nbehind him, flying low, and apparently debating the advisability of\nattacking him.\n\nRoberts waved his arms and shouted; it had not the slightest effect on\nthe bird, which, now that it was closer, he perceived to move its hind\nwings only, holding its fore-wings out like those of an airplane. He\nwished he had a weapon of some kind; lacking one, he drew the car up to\nthe curb and ran into a building. The bird alighted outside and began to\npeck the door in, but by the time it got through Roberts had climbed a\nmaze of stairs, and though he could hear it screaming throatily behind\nhim, it did not find him and eventually gave up the search.\n\nThe end of this remarkable tale was delivered to an enlarged audience.\nGloria had arrived, bringing a chubby little man who announced himself\nas F. W. Stevens.\n\n\"The boy plunger?\" queried Murray absent-mindedly, and realized from\nGloria's gasp that he had said the wrong thing.\n\n\"Well, I operate in Wall Street,\" Stevens replied rather stiffly.\n\nBen came with three recruits. At the sight of the first, Murray gasped.\nEven in the metal caricature, he had no difficulty in recognizing the\nhigh, bald forehead, the thin jaws and the tooth-brush moustache of\nWalter Beeville, the greatest living naturalist. Before dark the others\nwere back--Yoshio with one new acquisition and Mrs. Roberts, whose\nenergy paralleled her strength, with no less than four, among them an\nelaborately gowned woman who proved to be Marta Lami, the Hungarian\ndancer who had been the sensation of New York at the time of the\ncatastrophe.\n\nThey gathered in the Times Square drug store in a strange babble of\nphonographic voices and clang of metal parts against the stone floor and\nsoda fountains. It was Roberts who secured a position behind one of\nthese erstwhile dispensers of liquid soothing-syrup and rapped for\norder.\n\n\"I think the first thing to be done,\" he said, when the voices had grown\nquiet in answer to his appeal, \"is to organize the group of people here\nand search for more. If it had not been for the kindness of Mr. Ruby\nhere, my family and I would not have known about the necessity of using\noil on this new mechanical make-up nor of the value of electrical\ncurrent as food. There may be others in the city in the same state. What\nis the--ah--sense of the gathering on this topic?\"\n\nStevens was the first to speak. \"It's more important to organize and\nelect a president,\" he said briefly.\n\n\"A very good idea,\" commented Roberts.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Stevens, ponderously, \"I move we proceed to elect\nofficers and form as a corporation.\"\n\n\"Second the motion,\" said Murray almost automatically.\n\n\"Pardon me.\" It was the voice of Beeville the naturalist. \"I don't think\nwe ought to adopt any formal organization yet. It hardly seems\nnecessary. We are practically in the golden age, with all the resources\nof an immense city at the disposal of--fourteen people. And we know very\nlittle about ourselves. All the medical and biological science of the\nworld must be discarded and built up again. At this very moment we may\nbe suffering from the lack of something that is absolutely necessary to\nour existence--though I admit I cannot imagine what it could be. I think\nthe first thing to do is to investigate our possibilities and establish\nthe science of mechanical medicine. As to the rest of our details of\nexistence, they don't matter much at present.\"\n\nA murmur of approval went round the room and Stevens looked somewhat put\nout.\n\n\"We could hardly adopt anarchy as a form of government,\" he offered.\n\n\"Oh, yes we could,\" said Marta Lami, \"Hurray for anarchy. The Red Flag\nforever. Free love, free beer, no work!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gloria, \"what's the use of all this metallizing, anyway? We\ngot rid of a lot of old applesauce about restrictions and here you want\nto tie us up again. More and better anarchy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Say,\" came a deep and raucous voice from one of the newcomers. \"Why\ndon't we have just a straw boss for a while till we see how things work\nout? If anyone gets fresh the straw boss can jump him, or kick him out,\nbut those that stick with the gang have to listen to him. How's that?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Ben, heartily. \"You mean have a kind of Mussolini for a\nwhile?\"\n\n\"That's the idea. You ought to be it.\"\n\nThere was a clanging round of metallic applause as three or four people\nclapped their hands.\n\n\"There is a motion--\" began Roberts.\n\n\"Oh, tie a can to it,\" said Gloria, irreverently, \"I nominate Ben Ruby\nas dictator of the colony of New York for--three months. Everybody\nthat's for it, stick up your hands.\"\n\nEleven hands went up. Gloria looked around at those who remained\nrecalcitrant and concentrated her gaze on Stevens. \"Won't you join us,\nMr. Stevens?\" she asked sweetly.\n\n\"I don't think this is the way to do things,\" said the Wall Street man\nwith a touch of asperity. \"It's altogether irregular and no permanent\ngood can result from it. However, I will act with the rest.\"\n\n\"And you, Yoshio?\"\n\n\"I am uncertain that permission is granted to this miserable worm to\nvote.\"\n\n\"Certainly. We're all starting from scratch. Who else is there? What\nabout you, Mr. Lee?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know him too well.\"\n\nThe rest of the opposition dissolved in laughter and Ben made his way to\nthe place by the counter vacated by Roberts.\n\n\"The first thing we can do is have some light,\" he ordered. \"Does\nanyone know where candles can be had around here? I suppose there ought\nto be some in the drug store across the street, but I don't know where\nand there's no light to look by.\"\n\n\"How about flashlights? There's an electrical and radio store up the\nblock.\"\n\n\"Fine, Murray you go look. Now Miss Roberts, will you be our secretary?\nI think the first thing to do is to get down the name and occupation of\neveryone here. That will give us a start toward finding out what we can\ndo. Ready? Now you, Miss Rutherford, first.\"\n\n\"My name is Gloria Rutherford and I can't do anything but play tennis,\ndrink gin and drive a car.\"\n\nThe rest of the replies followed: \"F. W. Stevens, Wall Street,\"\n\"Theodore Roberts, lawyer,\" \"Archibald Tholfsen, chess-player,\" \"H. M.\nDangerfield, editor,\" \"Francis X. O'Hara, trucking business,\" (this was\nthe loud-voiced man who had cut the Gordian knot of the argument about\norganization). \"Are you a mechanic, too?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"Well, not a first class one, but I know a little about machinery.\"\n\n\"Good, you're appointed our doctor.\"\n\n\"Paul Farrelly, publisher,\" \"Albert F. Massey, artist\"--the voices\ndroned on in the uncertain illumination of the flashlights.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Ben at the conclusion of the list. \"The first\nthing I'll do is appoint Walter Beeville director of research. Fact\nnumber one for him is that we aren't going to need much of any sleep. I\ndon't feel the need of it at all, and I don't seem to see any signs\namong you. O'Hara will help him on the mechanical side.... I suggest\nthat as Mr. Beeville will need to observe all of us we make the\nRockefeller Institute our headquarters. He will have the apparatus there\nto carry on his work. Let's go.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nRebellion\n\n\nThey whirled away to the east side of the city and up Second Avenue like\na triumphal cortege, blissfully disregarding the dead traffic lights,\nthough now and then they had to dodge the ruins of some truck or taxi\nthat had come out second best from an argument with an elevated pillar\nwhere the driver's hand had been frozen at the wheel. At Forty-ninth\nStreet Ben's car, in the lead, swung in to the curb and pulled up.\n\n\"What is it?\" ... \"Is this the place?\" ... \"Anything wrong?\"\n\nAn illuminating voice floated up. \"Electric store, get all the\nflashlights and batteries you can. We're going to need them.\"\n\nA few moments later they were at the great institution, strangely dark\nand silent now after all its years of ministering to the sick, with a\nline of rust showing redly on the tall iron fence that surrounded the\ngrounds. They trooped into the reception room, flickering their lights\nhere and there like fireflies. Ben mounted a chair.\n\n\"Just a minute, folks,\" he began. \"I want to say something.... What we\nhave to do here is build civilization up all over again. Undoubtedly\nthere are more people alive--if not in New York, then in other places.\nWe have two jobs--to get in touch with them and to find out what we can\ndo. Mr. Beeville is going to find out about the second one for us, but\nwe can do a lot without waiting for him.\n\n\"In the first place, there's that funny-looking bird that we all saw and\nthat chased Roberts. There may be others like it and a lot of new queer\nforms of animal life around that would be dangerous to us. Therefore, I\nthink it's in line to get some weapons. Miss Lami, you and Mr. Tholfsen\nare delegated to dig up a hardware store and find guns and\ncartridges.... Now for the rest, I'm open to suggestions.\"\n\nEverybody spoke at once. \"Wait a minute,\" said Ben. \"Let's take things\nin order. What was your idea, Mr. Stevens?\"\n\n\"Organize regular search parties.\"\n\n\"And a good idea, too. We don't even need to wait for daylight.\nEverybody who can drive, get a car and trot along.\"\n\n\"X-ray machines are going to be awfully useful in my work,\" offered\nBeeville. \"I wonder if there isn't some way of getting enough current to\nrun one.\"\n\n\"As far as I remember, this building supplies its own current. Murray,\nyou and Massey trot down and get a fire up under one of the boilers.\nAnything else?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" came from Dangerfield, the editor. \"It seems to me that the first\nthing anyone else in the world would try to do if he found himself made\ninto a tin doll like this is get hold of a radio. How about opening up a\nbroadcasting station?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether you can get enough power, but you can try. Go to\nit. Do you know anything about radio?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"All right. Pick whoever you want for an assistant and try it out. Any\nmore ideas?\"\n\n\"What day is it?\" asked Ola Mae Roberts.\n\nNobody had thought of it, and it suddenly dawned on the assemblage that\nthe last thing they remembered was when the snow on the roof-tops\nbespoke a chilly February, while now all the trees were in leaf and the\nair was redolent of spring.\n\n\"Why--I don't know,\" said Ben. \"Anybody here got any ideas on how to\nfind out?\"\n\n\"It would take an experienced astronomer and some calculation to\ndetermine with accuracy,\" said Beeville. \"We'd better set an arbitrary\ndate.\"\n\n\"O. K. Then it's May 1, 1947. That's two years ahead of time, but it\nwill take that long to find out what it really is.\"\n\nThe assumption that sleep would be unnecessary proved correct. All night\nlong, cars roared up to the door and away again on their quests. The\nnumber of people found was small--the cream had apparently been gathered\nthat morning. O'Hara brought in a metallic scrubwoman from one of the\ndowntown buildings, the tines that represented her teeth showing stains\nof rust where she had incautiously drunk water; Stevens turned up with a\nslow-voiced young man who proved to be Georgios Pappagourdas, the\nattach\u00e9 of the Greek consulate whose name had been in the papers in\nconnection with a sensational divorce case; and Mrs. Roberts came in\nwith two men, one of them J. Sterling Vanderschoof, president of the\nsteamship lines which bore his name.\n\nAt dawn Dangerfield came in. He had set up a powerful receiving set by\nmeans of storage batteries but could find no messages on the air, and\ncould find no source of power sufficient for him to broadcast.\n\nThe morning, therefore, saw another and somewhat less optimistic\nconference. As it was breaking up Ben said, \"You Tholfsen, take Stevens,\nVanderschoof and Lee and get a truck, will you? You'll find one about\nhalf a block down the street. Go up to one of the coal pits and get some\nfuel for our boilers here. We haven't too large a supply.\"\n\nThere was a clanking of feet as they left and Ben turned into the\nlaboratory where Beeville was working, with the scrubwoman as a subject.\n\n\"Something interesting here,\" said the naturalist, looking up as he\nentered. \"The outer surface of this metal appears to be rust-proof, but\nwhen you get water on the inside, things seem to go. It acts like a\nspecially annealed compound of some kind. And look--\" He seized one of\nthe arms of his subject, who gazed at him with mildly unresisting eyes,\nand yanked at the outer layer of metal bands that composed it. The band\nstretched like one of rubber, and she gave a slight squeal as it snapped\nback into position. \"I don't know of any metal that has that\nflexibility. Do you? Why--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door swung open and they turned to see Murray and Tholfsen.\n\n\"Beg pardon for interrupting the sacred panjandrum,\" said the former,\n\"but Stevens and Vanderschoof are indulging in a sulk. They don't want\nto play with us.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" remarked Ben cheerfully and started for the door, the other\ntwo following him.\n\nHe found the recalcitrants soon enough. The Wall Street man was seated\nacross a doctor's desk from Vanderschoof and looked up calmly from an\ninterrupted conversation as Ben entered.\n\n\"Thought I asked you two to go with the boys for some coal,\" said Ben,\nwaving at them. \"My mistake. I meant to.\"\n\n\"You did. I'm not going.\"\n\nBen's eyes narrowed. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"This is the United States of America, young man. I don't recognize that\nI am under your orders or anyone else's. If you think you are going to\nget us to accept any such Mussolini dictatorship, you've got another\nguess coming. As I was saying--\" he turned back to Vanderschoof with\nelaborate unconcern, and Murray took a step toward him, bristling\nangrily.\n\n\"Leave me alone, boys, I can handle this,\" said Ben, waving the other\ntwo back. \"Mr. Stevens.\" The broker looked up with insolent politeness.\n\"This is not the United States, but the colony of New York. Conditions\nhave changed and the sooner you recognize that the better for all of us.\nWe are trying to rebuild civilization from the ruins; if you don't share\nin the work, you shall not share in the benefits.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Put you out.\"\n\nThere was a quick flash, and Ben was staring into the business end of a\nLuger automatic, gripped tightly in the broker's hand. \"Oh, no you\nwon't. You forget that you made this anarchy yourself when you refused\nto have a president. Now get out of here, quick, and let me talk with my\nfriend.\"\n\nFor a moment the air was heavy with tension. Then Vanderschoof smiled--a\nsuperior smile. Stevens' eyes blinked, and in that blink Ben charged,\nand as he moved, Murray and Tholfsen followed. There was a report like a\nclap of thunder in the narrow room, a tremendous ringing clang as the\nbullet struck the metal plate of Ben's shoulder and caromed to the\nceiling, whirling him around against the desk and to the floor by the\nforce of the impact. Murray leaped across his prostrate body, striking\nat the gun and knocking it down just in time to send the second shot\nwild; Tholfsen stumbled and fell across Ben.\n\nBen was up first, diving for Murray and Stevens, now locked in close\ngrapple, but the chess-player's action was more effective. From his\nprone position he reached up, grabbed Stevens' legs and pulled them from\nunder him, bringing him down with a crash, just as Ben's added weight\nmade the struggle hopelessly one-sided. In a moment more the dictator of\nthe New York colony was sitting on his subject's chest while Murray held\nhis arms. Vanderschoof, with the instinctive terror of the man of\nfinance for physical violence, sat cowering in his chair.\n\n\"Get--some wire,\" gasped Ben. \"Don't think--cloth will hold him.\"\n\nTholfsen released his hold on the legs and climbed to his feet. \"Watch\nthe other one, Murray,\" said Ben, his quick eye detecting a movement\ntoward the gun on Vanderschoof's part.\n\n\"Now you, listen,\" he addressed the man beneath him. \"We could tie you\nup and lay you away to pickle until you died for the lack of whatever\nyou need, or we could turn you over to Beeville to cut up as a specimen,\nand by God,\" glaring with a kind of suppressed fury, \"I wouldn't\nhesitate to do it! You're jeopardizing the safety of the whole\ncommunity.\"\n\nThe grim face beneath him showed neither fear nor contrition. He\nhesitated a moment.\n\n\"If I let you go and give you a car and a couple of batteries, will you\npromise to clear out and never come back?\"\n\nStevens laughed shortly. \"Do you think you can bluff me? No.\"\n\n\"All right, Tholfsen, get his feet first,\" said Ben, as the chess-player\nreappeared with a length of light-cord he had wrenched from somewhere.\nThe feet kicked energetically, but the task was accomplished and the\narms secured likewise. \"You watch him,\" said Ben, \"while I get a car\naround.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Vanderschoof, speaking for the first\ntime since the scuffle.\n\n\"Throw him in the river!\" declared Ben, with ruthless emphasis. \"Let him\nget out of that.\" Stevens took this statement with a calm smile that\nshowed not the slightest trace of strain.\n\n\"But you can't do that,\" protested the steamship man. \"It's--it's\ninhuman.\"\n\n\"Bring him outside boys,\" said Ben, without deigning to reply to this\nprotest, and clanged out to the car.\n\nThey lifted the helpless man into the back seat, and with a man on\neither side of him, started for Queensboro Bridge. The journey was\naccomplished in a dead silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalfway down the span, Ben brought the taxi round with a flourish and\nclimbed out, the other two lifting Stevens between them. Murray looked\ntoward his friend, half expecting him to relent at the last moment, but\nhe motioned them wordlessly on, and they set down their burden at the\nrail.\n\n\"Over with him!\" said Ben remorselessly. They bent....\n\n\"I give up,\" said Stevens in a strangely husky voice. Murray and\nTholfsen paused.\n\n\"Did you hear what I said?\" said Ben. \"Over with him!\"\n\nThey heaved. \"Stop!\" screamed the broker. \"For God's sake, I'll give up.\nI'll go. Oh-h-h!\" The last was a scream, as Ben laid a detaining hand on\nMurray's arm.\n\n\"Let him down, boys,\" he said quietly. \"Now listen, Stevens. I don't\nwant to be hard on you--but we've got to have unanimity. You're done.\nTake a car and clear out. If I let you go now, will you promise to stay\naway?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Wall Street man. \"Anything, only for God's sake don't do\nthat!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Ben.\n\nAs they were loading the banker in the car for the return trip a thought\nstruck Murray. \"By the way, Ben,\" he remarked, \"didn't he nick you with\nthat gun?\" \"That's right,\" said Ben, \"he did.\" And gazed down at the\nlong bright scratch in the heavy metal that covered his shoulder joint.\nIt was uninjured.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nFlight!\n\n\nBut when Tholfsen and Murray returned with the coal, Vanderschoof was\nmissing as well as Stevens, and that evening when the car in which Marta\nLami had accompanied Roberts on the exploration of the Brooklyn Heights\ndistrict drew up at the Institute, it had only one occupant.\n\n\"What happened to Miss Lami?\" asked Ben.\n\nRoberts gazed at him, surprised. \"Didn't you send them? While we were at\nthe St. George Hotel a car came along with Stevens and two of those new\nmen in it. One was the Greek. They spoke to her for a minute and she\nsaid they brought a message from you that she was to go with them.\"\n\n\"M-hm,\" said Ben. \"I see. Well, as long as they don't come back, it's\nall right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car whirled out the Albany Post Road in a silence that was\nindicative of the rivalry that had already sprung up between Stevens and\nVanderschoof. As for Pappagourdas he found himself demoted to the\nposition of a \"yes man.\"\n\nThey had provided themselves with a liberal supply of guns and\nammunition, and with the foolish conservatism of the very rich, refusing\nto believe that money was valueless, had raided store after store until\nthey had acquired a considerable supply of currency.\n\n\"This is the Bear Mountain Bridge, isn't it?\" said the dancer. \"Let's\nstop at West Point and pick up a cadet. They're so ornamental.\"\n\nStevens glanced at her sourly from the wheel. \"We've got to hurry if we\nwant to get to Albany,\" he said.\n\n\"Still,\" offered Vanderschoof protectingly, \"why not stop at the Point?\nWe might find some people there. I know Colonel Grayson. Played golf\nwith him there last summer. Ha, ha! When I holed out an eighteen-footer\nat the seventh, he was so mad, he wouldn't speak to me all the rest of\nthe afternoon. It was the turning point of the battle. Ha, ha!\"\n\nStevens, with a grunt, swung the wheel round and began the ascent of the\nlong bridge ramp. He realized he had been outmaneuvered. To cover his\nretreat, he remarked, \"Isn't that a bird?\"\n\n\"The high muck-a-muck said something about birds last night,\" said the\ndancer, \"but he's such a Holy Joe that I didn't pay any attention.\"\n\n\"Aren't the birds all dead?\" asked the Greek, respectfully. \"I saw some\nin the gutter outside my window and they were turned to iron.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car coughed to the rise, made it and slid across the bridge.\n\n\"It is a bird,\" said the dancer, \"and what a bird! Papa, look at the\nostrich.\"\n\nPappagourdas and Vanderschoof followed her pointing finger. Along its\ndirection they saw, a couple of hundred feet behind and above them, the\nwidespread wings and heavy body of the same type of four-winged bird\nRoberts had encountered. Vanderschoof tugged at his pocket. \"Maybe it'll\ncome close enough to give us a shot,\" he said hopefully.\n\nThe bird was certainly gaining on them, though the speedometer of the\ncar had risen beyond forty miles an hour. As it drew nearer, they could\nmake out the high-domed, most un-birdlike head set with pop-eyes fixed\nin a permanent expression of astonishment, the short bill, slightly\nhooked at the tip, and the huge expanse of the wings. It seemed to be\ninspecting them as a smaller avian might inspect a bug crawling across a\nroad.\n\nAs it drew nearer, it swooped to within a couple dozen feet of the car;\nthey noticed that its feet, folded back beneath the body, had a metallic\nluster. Then Vanderschoof fired, with a bang that almost deafened the\nrest. The bird seemed surprised rather than frightened or resentful. At\nthe sound of the gun it bounded upward a few feet and then swung again,\nmoving along parallel with the car and twisting its neck to take a good\nlook at the passengers. The chance was too good to be missed; both\nPappagourdas and Vanderschoof fired this time, steadying themselves\nagainst the motion of the car. One of the shots evidently went home, for\na couple of feathers floated down, and the bird, with a series of\near-piercing squawks, spiralled down the side of the mountain toward the\nriver-bank, three or four hundred feet below.\n\n\"Bull's eye!\" yelled Pappagourdas. \"Gimme the cigar! Let's stop the car\nand go get it.\"\n\n\"What's the use,\" said Stevens, \"you couldn't eat it, anyway. Listen to\nhim yell, would you?\"\n\nAbove the sound of the motor the screeching of the wounded bird still\nreached them faintly from the bottom of the cliff.\n\n\"I think it's a damn shame to shoot up the poor thing,\" said Marta Lami.\n\n\"Oh, he'll be all right,\" declared Vanderschoof. \"Don't believe we\ntouched anything but one wing, and it'll just sit and eat ground-berries\ntill it gets well.\"\n\nIt was perhaps half an hour later, and the distant hills were beginning\nto acquire a fine powder of dusk when they saw the second bird--a\nrapidly moving speck, far behind them and to one side of the road.\nVanderschoof saw it first and called the attention of the rest, but they\nquickly lost interest.\n\nHe continued to observe it. Were there two? He thought so, yet--. A\nmoment later he was sure there was more than one, as the car breasted a\nrise and gave them a better view. They seemed to be following fast. The\nridiculous idea that they meant to do something about their fallen\ncomrade came to him, to be dismissed instantly. Yet the birds were\ncertainly following them and he thought he made out a third, behind the\nothers.\n\nThe car coasted down a long slope, crossed a bridge and began to go up a\nhairpin rise. Vanderschoof looked back. The birds were invisible; he\nlooked again, in the right direction this time and saw them, so much\nlarger and nearer that he cried out. The others ceased their low-voiced\nconversation at the sound of his voice. \"What's the matter, papa?\" asked\nthe dancer.\n\n\"Those birds. Look.\"\n\n\"Why it looks almost as though they were following us.\"\n\nShe sat upright in the seat and squinted at them under an upraised hand.\nThe queer birds were close enough now so that the difference between\ntheir fore-wings and the steadily beating hind wings could be made out.\n\n\"You don't suppose they could be mad at us?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't be foolish,\" said Stevens, without turning around. \"Birds aren't\nintelligent enough for that.\" A long straight stretch lay before him and\nhe let the car out. Vanderschoof, watching with a trace of anxiety, saw\nthe birds also put on more speed. \"They are following us,\" he declared\nwith conviction.\n\n\"Look,\" said Marta Lami, \"that one is carrying something, too.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the bird, flying high, gained a position just above and\nahead of the car, dropped the object and instantly wheeled off and down\nto one side. There was a heavy thud on the road ahead, and a big rock\nbounded and rolled a score of feet before the car.\n\nMarta Lami screamed. Vanderschoof swore, with feeling. \"Get out your\nguns and drive them off,\" said Stevens. \"You fools, why did you have to\nshoot at them in the first place?\"\n\nBefore he had finished speaking Vanderschoof had his revolver out and\nwas firing at the second of the birds, now swinging into position above\nthem with another rock. He missed, but the bird, surprised, dropped its\nburden too soon, and they had the satisfaction of seeing it bounce among\nthe trees at the right of the road.\n\n\"Keep after them, that's right,\" said Stevens. \"We're not far from the\nPoint and we can get under cover there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoth the men in the back were shooting now--Vanderschoof slowly and with\ndeliberate aim; Pappagourdas in a panic-stricken rafale at the third\nbird, which, higher than the others, paid not the slightest attention to\nthem but jockeyed for position. Stevens began to twist the steering\nwheel--the car described a fantastic series of zigzags.\n\n\"What are they?\" he asked. \"I never saw anything like them.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Vanderschoof. (Bang!) \"Like the condors (Bang!)\nI used to see in South America, only bigger.\"\n\nCrash! The third rock burst in a shower of fragments not ten feet away,\none piece striking the windshield with a ping, and sending a long\ndiagonal crack across it. The first of the three birds was swinging up\nagain with another rock, screeching hoarse communications at the others.\n\nMarta Lami had fallen silent. As the bird began to circle above them,\npicking its position, Pappagourdas suddenly ceased firing, with a curse.\n\"Have you got any more bullets?\" he asked. \"Mine are all gone....\" His\nvoice broke suddenly, half-hysterical, \"It is the cranes of Ibicos,\" he\ncried.\n\nThe stone struck behind them. Evidently the bird had a healthy respect\nfor Vanderschoof's aim, which had kept it at such a height that it could\nnot aim accurately. But as the next stone missed they changed their\ntactics, screaming to each other. The third bird, whose turn it was to\ndrop a stone, merely flew along parallel with them, high enough to be\nout of range, waiting for the return of the others. When they arrived,\nall three strung out in a line and released their rocks simultaneously.\nThere was a resounding crash, the car reeled perilously on the edge of\nthe steep road, then righted and drove on with a clattering bang.\nLooking over the side Vanderschoof could see where the big rock had\nstruck the right running board, tearing a foot or two of it loose to\ntrail on the road.\n\n\"Wait,\" he cried, but Stevens shook his head.\n\nThey had a bit of luck at this point. The hunt for more stones or\nsomething of the kind delayed their enemies, and when they next saw the\nbirds winging up behind them, the white classical lines of the West\nPoint administration building already loomed ahead, clear in the\ngathering gloom.\n\nStevens turned in, swung the car around at the door, and halted it with\nscreaming brakes, just as the first of the birds overhead overshot the\nmark and turned to come back. In an instant the banker was out of the\ncar, dragging at Marta Lami's hand. Vanderschoof climbed numbly out the\nother side, and ran around the car toward the door of the building, but\nthe Greek missed his footing where the running board should have been\nand fell prone, just as one of the birds dived down with a yell of\ntriumph and dropped his stone accurately onto the struggling man.\n\n\"Run!\" shouted Stevens.\n\n\"But--the Greek,\" panted Vanderschoof as they climbed the steps.\n\n\"Hell with him. Or here--wait.\" Stevens turned and thrust his fist\nthrough the glass upper portion of the door. Out in the dusk the three\nbird-forms were settling round their fallen foe. The flash of the\nbanker's gun stabbed the night and was answered by a scream. Before he\ncould take aim again, with a quick beat of wings, they were gone and\nwhen, daring greatly, he ran out a few moments later, he found that\nPappagourdas was gone also.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found the others on one of the benches in the outer office of the\nbuilding, the girl with her face buried in her hands in an agony of\nfright and reaction. Vanderschoof, too old and cool a hand to give way\nin this fashion, looked up.\n\n\"What are they, Stevens?\" he asked.\n\nThe Wall Street man shrugged his shoulders helplessly. \"I don't know,\"\nhe said. \"Some new kind of high-power bird that developed while we were\nall being made into machines by that comet, I suppose. It's terrible....\nThey've got the Greek.\"\n\n\"Can't we get after them? There ought to be airplanes here.\"\n\n\"In this light? Can you fly one? I can't and I don't imagine the little\ngirl here can.\"\n\nThe \"little girl\" lifted her head. She had recovered. \"What did we come\nto this joint for, anyhow?\" she asked. \"To hang cr\u00eape on the\nchandeliers?\"\n\nThe words had the effect of an electric shock.\n\n\"Why, of course,\" said Stevens, \"we did come here to see if we could\nfind someone, didn't we?\" and turning round he pushed open the door into\nthe next room. Nothing.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said. \"Not much use trying to do anything tonight. We haven't\nany flashlights.\"\n\n\"Aw, boloney,\" said the dancer, \"what do you want us to do? Sit here and\ncount our fingers? Go on, big boy, find a garage, you can get a light\nfrom one of the cars.\"\n\n\"Won't those birds see it?\"\n\n\"You got a yellow streak a mile wide, haven't you? Birds sleep at\nnight.\"\n\nStevens took a half-unwilling step toward the door. \"Let me come with\nyou,\" said Vanderschoof, rising.\n\n\"What's the matter, papa? You got a little yellow in you, too?\"\n\nHe was dignified. \"Not at all. Here I'll leave my gun with you, Miss\nLami.\"\n\n\"We'll be seeing you,\" said Stevens, over his shoulder. \"Don't worry.\"\nAnd they were gone.\n\nTo the dancer their absence was endless. She would have given anything\nfor the velvet kick of a good drink of gin--\"but I suppose it would burn\nout my bearings,\" she mused ruefully. Heavens, she must spend the rest\nof her days as a robot. In the fading light she ruefully contemplated\nthe legs that had delighted the audiences of two continents, now become\ningenious mechanical devices beyond the power of delighting anyone but\ntheir owner.\n\nMore clearly than the rest, she realized that very little was left of\nthe old relation between the sexes. What would happen when the forceful\nStevens made the discovery also? Probably he would make a thinking robot\nof her to serve his ambition. Well, she had chosen to go with them--they\nseemed to offer more amusement than the stuffy prigs of the colony....\n\nWhat was that?\n\nShe listened intently. A subdued rattling, slightly metallic in\ncharacter. It might be a rat--no, too mechanical. The men--probably it\nwas them, or one of them, returning. She glanced out of the window. Not\nthere. The sound again--not from outdoors, but behind her--within the\nroom? She gripped the gun Vanderschoof had given her. Rattle, rattle.\nShe wished furiously for a light.\n\nThe birds? No--birds sleep at night. Rattle, rattle. Persistently. She\nstood up, trying to pierce the gathering dimness. No, the birds would\nmake more noise. They moved surely, with hoarse screams, as though they\nthought themselves the lords of the world. This sound was small, like\nthe chatter of a mechanical rat. What new horror in this strange world\nmight it not conceal? On slenderest tiptoes she backed cautiously across\nthe rug toward the outer door. Better the chance of the birds than this\nunknown terror of the darkness.\n\nHolding the gun before her firmly, she stepped back, back, feeling with\none hand for the door. Her hand met its smooth surface, then clicked as\nthe metallic joints came in contact with the doorknob. She paused,\nbreathless. Rattle, rattle, went the small sound, undiscouraged.\n\nWith a sudden jerk she flung the door open and tumbled down the steps,\nhalf-falling, and as she fell, as though in answer to the metallic clang\nof her body on the stone, a long pencil of violet light sprang silently\nout from somewhere back in the hills, moved thrice across the sky and\nthen faded as swiftly as it had come.\n\nShe felt the beam of a flashlight in her eyes, and got up, hearing her\nvoice with a sort of inward surprise as it babbled something slightly\nincoherent about \"things--in there.\"\n\nStevens' voice, rough with irritation. \"What is it you're saying?\" He\nshook her arm. \"Come on, little woman, pull yourself together.\"\n\n\"There must be someone else around here,\" remarked Vanderschoof,\nirrelevantly. \"Did you see that searchlight?\"\n\nMarta Lami pulled herself up short, shaking loose the hand with a touch\nof the arrogance that had made her the queen of the night life of New\nYork.\n\n\"Something in there gives me the heeby-jeebies,\" she said, pointing.\n\"Sounds like some guy shooting craps with himself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStevens laughed, somewhat forcedly. \"Well, it's nothing to be scared of,\nunless it's one of those damn birds, and if it was that he'd be taking\nus apart now. Come on!\"\n\nHe flung the door open and plunged in, the flashlight flickering before\nhim. Empty.\n\nThere was a door at the further end, next to the one they had\ninvestigated before. Toward this he strode, clump, clump on the carpet,\nand flung it open likewise. Empty again. No, there was something. The\nquesting beam came to rest on a brown army tunic behind the desk,\nfollowed it up quickly to the face and there held. For, staring at them\nwith mechanical fixity was another of those simulations of the human\nface in metal with which they were by now, so familiar. But this one was\ndifferent.\n\nFor it held the balance between the walking cartoons of men in metal,\nsuch as they themselves were, and the ugly and solid statues they had\nseen strewn about the streets of New York. It had the metal bands across\nthe forehead that they possessed, above which issued the same wiry hair,\nbut in this case curiously interwoven as though subjected to some great\nheat and melted into a single mass. And the nose was all of solid metal,\nand the eyes--the eyes ... were the eyes of a statue, giving back no\nlustrous reflexion of glass.\n\nA moment they paused breathless, then stepped forward, and as the beam\nof light shifted when Stevens moved, rattle, rattle, came the sound\nMarta Lami had heard, and when the light went back those unseeing eyes\nhad moved.\n\nFor a few seconds no one spoke. Then:\n\n\"Good God, it's alive!\" said Vanderschoof in a hushed voice and a thrill\nof horror went through the others as they recognized the truth of his\nwords.\n\nStevens broke the spell, stepping swiftly to the desk. \"Can we do\nanything for you?\" he asked. No movement from the metal figure--only\nthat ghastly rustle of the eyes as they turned here and there in the\nfixed head, searching for the light they would never find again. The\nWall Street man lifted one of the hands, tried to flex the arm that held\nit. It dropped back to the deck with a crash. Yet the metal of which\nthey were composed seemed in itself to be as pliant as that of their own\narms.\n\nA feeling of wonderment mingled with the horror of the spectators.\n\n\"What happened to him?\" asked Marta Lami in a whisper as though she\nfeared awakening a sleeper.\n\nStevens shrugged. \"What's happened to all of us? He's alive, I tell you.\nLet's ... get out of here. I don't like it.\"\n\n\"But where to?\" asked Vanderschoof.\n\n\"Follow the Albany road,\" said Stevens. \"We ought to move on. If those\nbirds come back in the morning--\" he left the sentence unfinished.\n\n\"But what about this poor egg?\" asked Marta Lami.\n\n\"Leave him,\" said Stevens, then suddenly giving way, \"there's too much\nmystery about this whole business around here. I'm going, I tell you,\ngoing. You can stay here till you rot if you like. I'm clearing out.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Menace\n\n\nNaturally, exploration of the familiar, yet unfamiliar world into which\nthey had suddenly been thrown was the first preoccupation of the New\nYork colonists. None of the group cared to wander far from the Institute\nduring the first weeks, however, in view of the possible difficulty of\nobtaining electrical food for a long trip, and Beeville's researches on\nthe potentialities of their new bodily form advanced so slowly that they\nhardly dared leave.\n\nHis discoveries in the first weeks were, in fact, purely negative.\nFarrelly, the publisher, smashed a finger in some machinery, but when\nO'Hara turned an exact duplicate out on his lathe and Beeville attached\nit, the new member altogether lacked sensation and could be moved only\nwith conscious effort--an indication that some as yet unfamiliar\nreaction underlay the secret of motion in their metal form.\n\nBut the greatest difficulty in the way of any activity lay in the almost\nabysmal ignorance of the mechanical and technical arts on the part of\nthe whole group. O'Hara was a fair mechanic; Dangerfield dabbled in\nradio, and Farrelly could run a printing press (he published a comical\nparody of a newspaper on one for several days; then abandoned the\neffort); but beyond that the utmost accomplishment was driving a car,\nand most of them realized how helpless the old civilization had been\nwithout its hewers of wood and drawers of water.\n\nTo remedy this condition, as much as to keep them busy, Ben assigned to\neach some branch of mechanical science to be learned, the supply of\ninformation, in the form of books, and of experimental material, in\nevery form, being inexhaustible. Thus the first week found Tholfsen and\nMrs. Roberts scouring the line of the New York Central for a locomotive\nin running order. After numerous failures, they succeeded in getting the\nthing going, only to discover that the line was blocked with wrecks and\nthey would need a crane to clear the track for an exploring journey of\neven moderate length.\n\nAt the same time, Murray Lee, with Dangerfield and two or three others,\nmade an effort to get the Park Central's broadcasting station in\noperation; a work of some difficulty, since it involved ventures into\nwhat were, for them, unknown fields. Daily they tap-tapped messages to\neach other on telegraph sets rescued from a Western Union office, in\npreparation for the time when they could get a sending set put together.\n\nBut the most ambitious effort and the one that was to have the largest\nshare of ultimate consequences, was the expedition of Farrelly, Gloria\nand a clothing-store proprietor named Kevitz in quest of naval\nadventure. After a week's intensive study of marine engines from books\nthe three appropriated a tug from the Battery and set off on a cruise of\nthe harbor.\n\nHalf an hour later they were high and dry off Bedloe's Island, gloomily\ncontemplating the prospect of spending their lives there, for an attempt\nto swim when weighted down with three hundred pounds of hardware could\nend only in failure. Fortunately the tide came to their rescue, and with\nmore daring than judgment, they continued their voyage to Governor's\nIsland, where they were lucky enough to find a solitary artilleryman,\nweak with hunger, but hilarious with delight at the discovery that his\nmetallic form was not a delirium tremens delusion induced by the quart\nof gin he had absorbed on the night before the change.\n\nThe giant birds, which Beeville had professionally named\n\"tetrapteryxes,\" seemed to have vacated the city with the appearance of\nthe colonists. Even the nest Roberts had stumbled on proved deserted\nwhen an expedition cautiously revisited the place; and the memory of the\nbirds had sunk to the level of a subject for idle remarks when a new\nevent precipitated it into general attention.\n\nMassey, the artist, with all the time in the world, and the art supplies\nof New York under his finger, had gone off on an artistic jag, painting\nday and night. One morning he took his canvas to the top of the Daily\nNews building to paint the city at dawn from its weather-observation\nstation. The fact that he had to climb stairs the whole way up and\nfinally chisel through the door at the top was no bar to his enthusiasm.\nKevitz, hurrying down Lexington Avenue in a car to join his fellow\nmariners in investigating the machinery of a freighter, saw him in the\nlittle steel cage, silhouetted against the reddening light of day.\n\nThere was an informal rule that everyone should gather at the Institute\nat ten in the evening, unless otherwise occupied, to report on the day's\nevents, and when Massey did not appear two or three people made comments\non the fact, but it was not treated as a matter of moment. When the\nartist had not shown up by dawn of the next day, however, Murray and\nGloria went to look for him, fearing accident. As they approached the\nbuilding Murray noticed that the edge of the weather observation\nplatform was twisted awry. He speeded up his car, but when they arrived\nand climbed the mountainous flights of stairs he found no bent and\ndamaged form, as he had expected.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe roof of the building held nothing but the painting on which he had\nbeen working--a half-completed color sketch of the city as seen from the\ntower.\n\n\"Where do you s'pose he went?\" asked Gloria.\n\n\"Don't know, but he went in a hurry,\" replied Murray. \"He doesn't care\nabout those paintings much more than he does about his life.\"\n\n\"Maybe he took a tumble,\" she suggested. \"Look, there's his easel, and\nit's busted.\"\n\n\"Yes, and that little chair he totes around, and look how it's all\ntwisted out of shape.\"\n\n\"Let's look over the edge. Maybe he went bugs and jumped. I knew a guy\nthat did that once.\"\n\n\"Nothing doing,\" said Murray, peering over the parapet of the building.\n\nMystery.\n\n\"Say--\" it was Gloria who spoke. \"Do you suppose those birds--the\ntetra-axes or whatever Beeville calls them--?\"\n\nThey turned and scanned the sky. The calm blue vault, flecked by the\nfleecy clouds of summer, gave no hint of the doom that had descended on\nthe artist.\n\n\"Nothing to do but go home, I guess,\" said Murray, \"and report another\nrobbery in Prospect Park.\"\n\nThe meeting of the colonists that evening was serious.\n\n\"It comes to this, then,\" said Ben, finally. \"These birds are dangerous.\nI'm willing to grant that it might not have been they who copped Massey,\nbut I can't think of anything else. I think it's a good idea for us to\nleave here only in pairs and armed, until we're certain the danger is\nover.\"\n\n\"Ain't that kind of a strong step, Mr. Ruby?\" asked Kevitz. \"It don't\nseem to me like all that business is necessary.\"\n\nBen shook his head decisively. \"You haven't seen these things,\" he said.\n\"In fact, I think it would be a good idea for us all to get some guns\nand ammunition and do target practice.\"\n\nThe meeting broke up on that note and the members of the colony filed\ninto the room where the supply of arms was stored, and presently to form\nan automobile procession through the streets in search of a suitable\nshooting gallery.\n\nWhen targets were finally set up in the street in automobile lights, the\ngeneral mechanical efficiency of the colony revealed itself once more.\nGloria Rutherford was a dead shot and the artilleryman from Governor's\nIsland almost as good; Ben himself and Murray Lee, who had been to\nPlattsburg, knew at least the mechanism of rifles, but the rest could\nonly shut their eyes and pull the trigger, with the vaguest of ideas as\nto where the bullet would go. And as Ben pointed out after the buildings\nalong the street had been peppered with the major portion of Abercrombie\nand Fitch's stock of ammunition, the supply was not inexhaustible.\n\n\"And what shall we do for weapons then?\" he asked.\n\nYoshio, the little Japanese, raised his hand for attention.\n\n\"I have slight suggestion, perhaps merely cat's meow and not worthy\nexalted attention,\" he offered. \"Why not all people as gentlemen old\ntime in my country, carry sword? It is better than without weapon.\"\n\n\"Why not, indeed?\" said Ben above a hum of laughter. \"Let's go.\" And an\nhour later the company re-emerged from an antique store, belted with the\nstrangest collection of swords and knives and fishing gaffs ever borne\nby an earthly army.\n\n\"I wonder, though,\" said Gloria to Murray Lee, as they reached the\nInstitute as dawn was streaking up the sky. \"All this hooey doesn't seem\nto mean much. If those birds are as big as that they aren't going to be\nscared by these little toad-stabbers.\"\n\nShe was right. That night Ola Mae Roberts was missing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe siege came a week later.\n\nIt was a week of strained tenseness; a certain electricity seemed at\nhand in the atmosphere, inhibiting speech. The colonists felt almost as\nthough they were required to whisper....\n\nA week during which Murray, with Dangerfield and Tholfsen, worked\nenergetically at their radio, and progressed far enough so they could do\na fairly competent job of sending and receiving in Morse code. A week\nduring which the naval party got a freighter from the South Street docks\nand brought her round into the Hudson.\n\nAt dawn one morning, Gloria, with Farrelly, Kevitz and Yoshio, piled\ninto a limousine with the idea of taking the freighter on a trip to\nConey Island. Murray accompanied them to try communicating with the\nshore via the ship's wireless.\n\nThe day was dark, with lowering clouds, which explains why they missed\nseeing the tetrapteryxes. But for the General Sherman statue they never\nwould have seen them until too late. The general's intervention was\npurely passive; Murray noticed and called Gloria's attention to the\ncurious expression the misty light gave the bronze face and she looked\nup to see, to be recalled to her driving by a yell from Kevitz\nannouncing the metallic carcass of a policeman squarely in their path.\n\nGloria twisted the wheel sharply to avoid it; the car skidded on the\ndamp pavement, and reeling crazily, caromed into the iron fence around\nthe statue with a crash. At the same moment an enormous mass of rock\nstruck the place where they should have been and burst like a shell,\nsending a shower of fragments whistling about their ears.\n\nShaken and dazed by the shock, they rolled out of the car, for the\nmoment mistaking the two impacts for one; and as they did so there came\na rush of wild wings, an eldritch scream and Yoshio was snatched into\nthe air before their very eyes. Kevitz fired first, wildly and at\nrandom. Murray steadied himself, dropping his gun across his left\nforearm, and shot cool and straight--but at too great a distance, and\nthey saw nothing but a feather or two floating down from the great\nfour-winged bird as it swung off over Central Park, carrying the little\nJap. They saw him squirm in the thing's grip, trying to get his sword\nloose, and then with a rattle of dropped stones around them, more of the\nbirds charged home.\n\nOnly Gloria had thought of this and withheld her fire. The others swung\nround as she shot and in an instant the whole group was a maze of\nwhirling wings, clutching claws, shouts, shots and screams. In twenty\nseconds it was done: Gloria and Murray rose panting and breathless, and\nlooked about. Beside them, two gigantic bird-forms were spilling their\nlives in convulsive agony. Dangerfield and Farrelly were gone--and a\nrending screech from behind the buildings told only too well where.\n\n\"What's the next step?\" asked Murray with such owlish solemnity that\nGloria gave a burst of half-hysterical laughter. She looked round.\n\n\"Beat it for that building,\" she said, and gathering her torn skirts\nabout her, set the example.\n\nThey made it by the narrowest of margins, standing breathless in what\nhad been the Peacock Alley of one of New York's finest hotels to see one\nof the great birds strut past the door like a clumsy caricature of an\nangel.\n\n\"And poo-poo for you,\" said Murray, thumbing his nose at the apparition.\n\"But what we'll do now I don't know.\"\n\n\"Play pinochle till they come look us up,\" suggested Gloria. \"Besides,\nmy bullets are all gone.\"\n\n... They waited all day, taking tentative glances from one or another of\nthe windows. The birds remained invisible, apparently not caring for the\nprospect of a battle in the constricted space of the hotel rooms. But\namid the rain and low-hung clouds they might be lurking just outside and\nboth Murray and Gloria judged it too dangerous to venture a dash. As\nnight came on, however, they made a try for the hotel's garage, achieved\nit without accident, and between them, rolled one of the cars to the\ndoor.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Murray, as Gloria got in, \"what was that?\"\n\n\"This dam' starter.\" She stirred her foot vigorously. \"It won't work.\"\n\n\"No. Wait.\" He held out a restraining hand. A sudden gust of wind bore a\ndash of rain down against them and with it, from the northeast, a\nfar-away scream, then a tapping and a heavy thud.\n\n\"Hot dog!\" ejaculated Murray. \"They're getting after the crowd. And at\nnight, too.\"\n\nThe car jerked forward suddenly as the starter caught. \"Hold it,\" cried\nMurray. \"Douse those headlights.\" They dodged the wreck of a street car,\nswung round a corner and headed for First Avenue, gathering speed.\nAnother corner, taken on two wheels in the darkness, the way to the\nInstitute lay before them.\n\nSuddenly a great flame of light sprang out in the sky, throwing the\nwhole scene into sharpest relief. There was a crash of rifle-fire from\nwindow and door of the building and across the front of it one of the\nbirds coasted past. Crash! In the street before them something like a\nbomb burst, vomiting pennons of fire. Gloria swung the wheel, swung it\nback; they had a mad glimpse of brilliantly burning flames inside one of\nthe buildings across the street from the Institute, and then they were\ntumbling out of the car with rifle-fire beating all around them and the\nthud of dropping objects on either side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMurray stumbled, but the door was flung open and they were jerked in,\njust as one of the huge bird forms flung itself down past them.\n\n\"Thank God, you're safe,\" said Ben Ruby's voice. \"They got Dearborn and\nHarris and they're besieging us here.\" He pointed out of the window\nacross the street, where the rapidly-gaining fire was engulfing the\nbuilding.\n\n\"Did the birds do that little trick?\" asked Gloria.\n\n\"I hope to tell you, sister. You ain't seen nothing yet, either. They're\nshedding incendiary bombs all over the shop. How about Kevitz and\nFarrelly?\"\n\n\"Got them, too. At the Plaza--and the little Jap. Too bad; I liked that\nlittle sprout.\"\n\n\"I thank gracious lady for kindly expressed sentiment, but oversize\navians have not yet removed me,\" said a voice and Gloria looked down to\nsee Yoshio bowing at her side.\n\n\"Why, how did they come to let you off? Last I saw you were doing a\nheadspin over Central Park.\"\n\n\"I was fortune,\" replied the little man. \"Removing sword I operate on\nsaid bird to such extent that he drop me as hot customer, plosh in large\ntree. To get home is not so easy but I remember armored car provided by\nintelligent corporation for transport of bankroll, so here I am. Cat's\nMeow!\"\n\n\"Bright boy,\" said Gloria. \"Listen!\" Above their heads came another\ncrash, a tramp of feet and shouts. Roberts dashed into the room, rifle\nin hand. \"They've got the place on fire,\" he said. \"We'll have to clear\nout.\"\n\nBen Ruby fumbled at his waist, drew forth a whistle and blew a piercing\nblast, which was answered by shouts, as members of the colony began to\npour into the room from various points.\n\nAnother bomb burst in a fluff of light, just outside the window,\nthrowing weird shadows across the gathering and splitting a pane here\nand there by the force of its impact.\n\n\"Hot stuff,\" remarked Gloria. \"What are they trying to do--take us all\nat one gulp?\"\n\n\"Beeville says they never thought it up on their own,\" Ben assured her.\n\"Not smart enough. He thinks somebody doesn't like us and is sending\nthem around to tell us so. Listen, everybody!\"\n\nThe room quieted down.\n\n\"We've got to go at once. Our destination is the Times Square subway\nstation. They can't get us there. Anybody who gets separated meet the\nrest there. We'll go in groups of three to a car; one to carry a gun,\none a sword and one a light. Everybody got it?... Good.... Somebody give\nGloria one of those express rifles.... Here's the list then. First\nparty--Miss Rutherford, gun; Yoshio, sword; O'Hara, light. Go ahead.\"\n\nA coil of smoke drifted across the room from somewhere above--the sough\nof the burning made the only background to his words. With a quick\nhandshake the three made ready; a volley from the windows flashed out,\nand they dashed off. Those inside caught a glimpse of the dark form of\ntheir car as it rolled into the night. They were safe at all events. The\nsecond carload, in Yoshio's armored vehicle, also got free, but the\nthird had trouble. They had hardly made half the distance to the parked\ncars before there was a whir of wings, a scream, and the quick burst of\na bomb, luckily too far behind them to do damage. Those inside saw the\nlight-man stop suddenly, flashing his beam aloft, saw an orange flame\nspring from the gun and then their view of the three was blotted out in\na whirl of wings and action.\n\n\"Everybody out!\" yelled Ben. \"Now! While they're busy.\" In a concerted\nrush the colonists poured through the door.\n\nNobody could remember clearly what did happen. Someone was down--hurt\nsomewhere--but was flung into a car. Through the turmoil the tossing\nform of one badly-wounded bird struggled on the ground, and with a roar\nof motors the cavalcade started.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe Terror by Night\n\n\nIt would be futile--and impossible--to chronicle all the events of that\nwild ride; to tell how the light-bombs dropped unceasingly from above;\nhow the driver of one car, blinded by the glare, hurtled his vehicle\nthrough the plate-glass window of a store, and how McAllister, the\nartilleryman, fought off the birds with a huge shard of glass from the\nwindow; how the passengers in another car, wrecked by a bomb, got a\nfire-engine and cleared their way to Times Square with clanging bell and\nclouds of malodorous fire-extinguisher chemicals; or how Mrs. Roberts\ndecapitated one of the monsters with a single blow of the cleaver she\ncarried.\n\nDawn found them, a depressed group of fourteen, gathered in the\nprotection of the underground passages.\n\n\"Well, what next?\" asked Gloria, who seemed to have preserved more of\nher normal cheerfulness than anyone. \"Do we stay here till they come for\nus, or do we go get 'em?\"\n\n\"We get out,\" said Ben Ruby. \"No good here. They know too much for us.\"\n\n\"Right,\" declared Beeville. \"The usual methods of dealing with animals\nwon't work this time. They are all based on the fact that animals are\ncreatures of habit instead of intelligence, and unless I am much wrong,\nthese birds are intelligent and have some bigger intelligence backing\nthem.\"\n\n\"You mean they'll try to bomb us out of here?\" asked Roberts.\n\nMcAllister looked up from the dice he was throwing. \"You bet your sweet\nlife they will. Those babies know their stuff. The one that was after me\nwas onto the manual of the bayonet like he'd been raised on it.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" said Gloria, \"but what are we going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Get an anti-aircraft gun from the Island and shell hell out of them\nwhen they come round again,\" suggested the artilleryman.\n\n\"Said gun would be considerable weight for individual to transport in\npocket,\" said Yoshio doubtfully, as Ben raised his hand for silence amid\nthe ensuing laughter.\n\n\"There's a good deal in that idea,\" he said, \"but I don't think it will\ndo as it stands. The birds would bomb our gun to blazes after they had a\ndose or two from it. They're not so slow themselves you know. How about\nsome of the forts? Aren't there some big ones around New York?\"\n\nMcAllister nodded. \"There's Hancock. We could get a ship through.\"\n\n\"Say!\" Gloria leaped suddenly to her feet. \"While we're about it, can't\nwe get a warship--a battleship or something? Those babies would have a\nhot time trying to bomb one of Uncle Sam's battleships apart and there's\nall kinds of anti-aircraft guns on them.\"\n\n\"There's a destroyer in the Hudson,\" said someone.\n\n\"How many men does it take to run her?\"\n\n\"Hundred and fifty.\"\n\n\"But,\" put in Gloria, \"that's a hundred and fifty of the old style men\nwho had to have their three squares and eight hours' sleep every day,\nand they did a lot of things like cooking that we won't have to. What do\nyou say, Dictator, old scout? Shall we give it a whirl?\"\n\n\"O. K.--unless somebody has something better to offer,\" declared Ben,\nand in fifteen minutes more the colonists were cautiously poking their\nway out of the subway station en route to take command of U. S. S.\n_Ward_.\n\nCleaning up the ship before the start took the colonists a whole day. A\nsooty dust, like the product of a particularly obnoxious factory, had\nsettled over everything, and dealing with the cast-iron bodies of the\nsailors, wedged in the queer corners where they had fallen at the moment\nof the change, was a job in itself.\n\nAs night shut down, the whole crew, with the exception of Beeville and\nMurray Lee, who had spent some time in small boats and had therefore\nbeen appointed navigators, was busy going over the engine-room, striving\nto learn the complex detail of handling a warship.\n\nMurray and Beeville were poring over their navigating charts when a step\nsounded outside the chartroom and the wire-frizzled head of Gloria was\nthrust in.\n\n\"How goes it, children?\" she asked. \"Do we sail for the cannibal islands\nat dawn?\"\n\n\"Not on your life,\" replied Murray. \"This hooker is going to pull in at\nthe nearest garage until we learn what it's all about. Talk about\narithmetic! This is worse than figuring out a time-table.\"\n\nGloria laughed, then her face became serious. \"Do you think they'll bomb\nus again, Mr. Beeville?\"\n\n\"I don't see why not. They were clear winners in the last battle. But\nwhat gets me is where they come from. Why, they're a living refutation\nof the laws of evolution on the earth! Four wings and two legs!\nAlthough ...\" the naturalist looked at the sliding parts of his own arm,\n\"they are rather less incredible than the evolution that has overtaken\nmankind, unless we're all off our heads. Do you know any way to account\nfor it?\"\n\n\"Not me,\" said Murray, \"that's supposed to be your job; all we do is\nbelieve you when--\" Bang! The anti-aircraft gun had gone off just\noutside with an earsplitting report. With a common impulse the three\nmade for the door and looked upward to see the shell burst in a puff of\nwhite smoke, outlined against the dark clouds of evening, while above\nand beyond it sailed a black dot with whirring wings.\n\n\"That settles it,\" said Murray. \"Whether we like it or not, we're going\naway from here. I wish those nuts hadn't fired though. Now the birds\nknow what we've got. Trot down and tell them to get up steam, that's a\ngood girl, Gloria.\"\n\nThe lone tetrapteryx seemed no more than a scout, for the attack was not\nfollowed up. But it takes time to get steam up on long disused marine\nengines and all hands were below when the real attack was delivered.\n\nIt began with the explosion of a bomb somewhere outside and a dash of\nwater against the vessel's side that threw all of them off their feet.\nThere was a clang of metal and a rush for the deck--cut across by Ben's\nvoice. \"Take it easy! Everybody to the engines but McAllister, O'Hara\nand the navigators.\"\n\nThe four sprang for the ladder, Murray in the lead. Crash! A sound like\nthe thunder of a thousand tons of scrap iron on a sidewalk and the\ndestroyer pitched wildly.\n\nMurray's head came level with the deck. Instead of the darkness he had\nexpected it was flung into dazzling illumination by a flare burning on\nthe water not fifty yards away, with a light so intense that it seemed\nto have physical body. There was a perceptible wave of heat from it and\nthe water round it boiled like a cauldron.\n\n[Illustration: Instead of the darkness he had expected, the deck was\nflung into dazzling illumination.]\n\nHe tumbled onto the deck, running forward to trip the release of the\nanchor chain. At the break of the forecastle, he stumbled, and the\nstumble saved him, for at that moment another of the bombs fell, just in\nfront of the fore-deck gun. The whole bow of the ship seemed to burst\ninto intense, eye-searing flame. Deafened and blinded, Murray lay face\ndown on the deck, trying to recover his senses; behind him the others,\nequally overwhelmed, tumbled on the iron surface, rolling over and over,\nblindly.\n\nBut the birds, apparently unaware of how heavy a blow they had struck,\nseemed wary of the gun. The four groveling on the deck heard scream and\nanswering scream above them as the monsters discussed the question on\nthe wing. If they reached a decision it was too late, for McAllister and\nO'Hara, blind, drunk and sick though they were, staggered to the gun and\nsent a shot shrieking at wild venture into the heavens. Beeville, nearer\nto the blinding blaze of light, recovered more slowly, but found his way\nto the bridge where he fumblingly pulled the engine-room telegraph over\nto \"Full Speed Ahead.\"\n\nBelow, in the bowels of the vessel, there was a rumble of activity; a\nrapid whoosh of steam came from an exhaust pipe, a dash of sparks from\nthe destroyer's funnels, and slowly and haltingly she began to move.\nBang! went the anti-aircraft gun. Beeville heard Murray climbing the\nbridge behind him and then his cry, \"The anchor!\"\n\nToo late--with a surge that changed to a rattle, the destroyer moved,\ntearing the anchor from its ground and swinging slowly half-way round as\nthe weight dragged the damaged bow to one side. At that moment came\nanother bomb which, but for their motion, would have struck fair and\nsquare amidships. Bang! Bang! went the anti-aircraft gun. Murray dragged\nat the wheel, then swung the engine-room telegraph back to \"Stop.\" Just\nin time--the destroyer's bottom grated on something, her prow rent the\nside of a big speed-boat and she came to rest, pointing diagonally\nupstream.\n\nFortunately the attack broke off as rapidly as it had begun. A few\nscreams, lost in the darkness of the night were the only answer to\nanother shell from the gun. But there was no assurance that this was\nmore than a temporary respite. Murray and Beeville strove desperately to\nbring the warped bridge mechanism into running order while O'Hara\nrouted out a blow-torch from somewhere and attacked the anchor chain,\nnow welded into a solid mass with the deck by the force of the\nlight-bomb. Finally, weaving to and fro in the hands of the\ninexperienced mariners, she was gotten round and pointed downstream and\nout to sea. If the birds sought them again in the darkness there was no\nsign of it.\n\nDay found them stumbling down the Jersey coast, the foredeck a mass of\nwreckage and the ship leaking badly.\n\n\"Well, where are we now?\" called a cheerful voice, as Murray Lee stood\nat the wheel. \"Australia in sight yet?\"\n\nHe looked up to see Gloria's head emerging from the companion.\n\n\"Come on up,\" he said, \"I'm just going to turn the wheel over to\nBeeville and get busy with this radio. Don't think the bomb knocked it\nout. It did everything else, though. Look at that.\"\n\nHe indicated the prow of the ship, where the big gun hung down like a\ntired candle and the whole fore part of the vessel had dissolved into\ntears of metal.\n\n\"Golly,\" said Gloria, \"that was some egg those birds laid. What was it,\nanyway?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Never saw anything like it before. Must be some kind of\nnew-fangled high-power incendiary bomb to melt steel down like butter.\nWhy, even thermit wouldn't do that.\"\n\n\"I hope our friends don't think of looking us up here, then, or we'll be\nfinding out what it's like to walk under water.\"\n\n\"You said something, sister,\" declared Murray. \"Wait! I think I got\nsomething.\"\n\nHe fumbled with the radio dials before him, swinging them this way and\nthat: then clamped on the headset. \"Oh, boy, there's something coming\nthrough ... we're not alone in the world then.... Yes, there she is....\nDamn, I wish they wouldn't send so fast.... AAM2 calling.... Now who is\nAAM2?\" His fingers pressed the key in reply as the others watched him\nwith bated breath. \"Position, seventy-three, fifty-three west longitude;\nforty, o-three, north latitude. Here ...\" he wrote the figures down.\n\"Take this, one of you and dope it out. Ssh, there's more coming. Oh, he\nwants to know who we are and where. Call Ben, will you Gloria?\"\n\nShe dashed off to return with the dictator of the colonists just as\nBeeville, who had been fumbling over the charts with one hand, called\nsuddenly, \"Why, the position they give is right near here--hardly a\nhundred miles away. I don't know just what ours is, but it can't be far\nfrom this spot. Tell them that.\"\n\n\"Find out who they are first,\" Ben put in, practically. \"After what\nthey've done, I wouldn't put it past the tetrapteryxes to handle a radio\nset.\"\n\n\"... His Majesty's Australian ship _Brisbane_, they say,\" said Murray.\n\"Wait a minute, since they're so near, I think I can switch them over to\nthe radiophone.\" He ticked the key a moment, then twisted more dials and\nleaned back as a full and fruity voice, with a strong English accent,\nfilled the room.\n\n\"Compliments of Captain Entwhistle of the Royal Australian Navy to the\ncommander of the U. S. S. _Ward_, and can we arrange a meeting? The\nComet appears to have done a good deal of damage in your part of the\nworld and you are the first people we have encountered.\"\n\n\"Where's your microphone?\" asked Ben. \"Oh, there.... Compliments of\nBenjamin Franklin Ruby, temporarily in command of U. S. S. _Ward_ to\nCaptain Entwhistle of the Royal Australian Navy, and none of us are\nsailors. We just borrowed this ship, and if you want to see us you'll\nhave to pick us up. We'll keep along the coast toward Cape May. Can you\nmeet us?\"\n\nA chuckle was audible from the radiophone. \"I think we can manage it.\nAre there any of the big birds about in your part of the world? They\nhave been bothering us all summer.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ben, \"that's what we're running away from now. They've\ngot some bombs that are pure poison and they've been making regular war\non us--or probably you know about it?\"\n\n\"We haven't seen anything like that yet,\" declared the voice from the\nloud-speaker, \"but we've had plenty of trouble with them. Hold on a\nmoment. Our lookout reports sighting smoke from your funnels. Hold your\ncourse and speed. We'll pick you up.\"\n\nThe voice ceased with a snap, and the four in the control room of the\ndestroyer looked at each other.\n\n\"I'm glad he came around,\" remarked Ben. \"This destroyer is getting\nshopworn. Besides with a good warship on hand we'll be able to give\nthose birds what they're looking for. I hope he's got some airplanes.\"\n\n\"And somebody to fly them,\" continued Murray. \"What'll we do if he\nhas--go back and give them hell?\"\n\n\"If we can. Apparently he doesn't like the birds any too well himself.\nIt was the first thing he mentioned.\"\n\nThey ceased speaking as the thin pennon of smoke, followed by two tall\nmasts, became visible over the horizon. In a few minutes more the\n_Brisbane_ swept up, swung a circle and came to rest near them, while\nout from her side dropped a boat that began to move toward them with\ndipping oars.\n\nA moment later she was alongside. Ben stepped out on the deck, and as he\ndid so, there was a mutual exclamation of horrified amazement--for\nCaptain Entwhistle of the Royal Australian Navy was as much flesh and\nblood as any man they had seen in the old days, but a pale blue in\ncolor, and all his sailors were of the same extraordinary hue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAn Exploration\n\n\nThere was a moment's silence as the Australian captain steadied himself\nagainst the roll of the vessel, staring incredulously at the group that\ngathered round him.\n\n\"Are you--human?\" he finally managed to gasp.\n\n\"If we aren't somebody's been kidding us,\" said Gloria, irreverently.\n\"But are you? You're all blue!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the captain. \"It was the comet. We knew it struck in\nAmerica somewhere but didn't know where or what it did. What's the\nmatter with your ship?\" He indicated the wrecked and leaking bow. \"She\nseems to be down by the head.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was a valentine from the birds,\" said Ben. \"Can you give us\nquarters on your vessel? There aren't many of us.\"\n\nCaptain Entwhistle seemed to come out of a dream. \"Of course, of course.\nCome on. We can discuss things better in my cabin.\"\n\nAs they mounted to the deck of the _Brisbane_, even the trained sailors,\nthe light blue of their faces oddly at variance with the dark blue of\ntheir uniforms, could not refrain from staring at the colonists. They\ncrowded into the captain's cabin past rows of eager blue faces.\n\n\"I suggest,\" said Captain Entwhistle, \"that we begin by telling each\nother how this happened. I can scarcely credit the fact that you are\nhuman and can walk and talk. Would any of you care for a whiskey and\nsoda?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Murray, the spirit of fun stirring in him, \"but I'll\nhave a drink of lubricating oil if you can find any.\"\n\nThe naval officer looked at him, and remarked, a trifle stiffly,\n\"Certainly, if you wish. Williams--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't mind him,\" Ben Ruby cut in. \"Pardon me, Captain, he can drink\nlubricating oil perfectly well, but he's just joking with you. You were\nsaying about the comet--\"\n\n\"Why, you knew that the big comet struck the earth as predicted, didn't\nyou? It was on the morning of February sixteenth, last year--evening of\nFebruary fifteenth by American time. Even in our country, which is\naround on the other side of the earth, it caused a good deal of damage.\nThe gases it set free put everybody to sleep and caused a lot of\nwreckage. Our scientists say the gases of the comet in some unexplained\nway altered the iron in the h\u00e6moglobin of our blood to cobalt. It seems\nto work just as well, but that's why we're all blue. I don't quite\nunderstand it myself, but you know how these medical Johnnies are. Now\nwhat happened to you people?\"\n\n\"May I ask something first?\" said Beeville. \"What day is this?\"\n\n\"August eighteenth, 1946,\" said the captain as though slightly baffled\nby the question.\n\n\"Good God!\" said the scientist. \"Then we were there for over a year!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ben. \"All of us you see here and several others returned to\nconsciousness about the same time, two months ago. We know nothing of\nwhat the comet did to us or how this change occurred except that when we\nwoke up we were just what you see. Dr. Beeville has been experimenting\nwith a view to finding out what happened, but he hasn't made much\nprogress so far. All we know is that we're composed of metal that\ndoesn't rust easily, make our meals off electricity, and find the taste\nof any kind of oil agreeable. And the birds--\" he broke off with a\ngesture.\n\n\"Oh, yes, the birds,\" said the captain. \"Have they been annoying you,\ntoo? That's one of the reasons, aside from exploration, why we're here.\nI assume you mean the big four-winged birds that we call dodos down\nunder. We haven't seen much of them, but occasionally they come and fly\naway with a sheep or even a man. One of our aviators chased one several\nhundred miles out to sea recently and we had assumed they came from one\nof the islands. Our scientists don't know what to make of them.\"\n\n\"Neither do ours, except that they're an unadulterated brand of hell,\"\nput in Murray. \"We were all living in New York, snug as bugs in a rug,\nwhen they began dropping incendiary bombs on us and carrying off anyone\nthey could get hold of.\"\n\n\"Including this insignificant person,\" said Yoshio, proudly.\n\n\"Incendiary bombs! Do you mean to tell me they have intelligence enough\nfor that?\"\n\n\"I'll tell the cockeyed world they have! Did you see the prow of our\nship? That's where one of their little presents got home. If anyone had\nbeen there, he wouldn't be anything but scrap iron now. If you really\nwant to find out what it's all about come on up to New York, but get\nready for the fight of your life.\"\n\nThe captain leaned back, sipping his drink meditatively. \"Do you know,\"\nhe said, \"that's just what I was thinking of doing? Frankly your story\nis all but incredible, but here you are as proof of it and you don't\nseem to be robots, except in appearance.\"\n\n\"Oh, boy,\" whispered Murray to Gloria, \"wait till these babies get after\nthe birds with their eight-inch guns. They'll wish they'd never heard of\nus. I'm glad I'm going to be on hand to see the fun.\"\n\n\"Yeh, but maybe the birds will have something up their feathers, too,\"\nshe replied. \"I wouldn't like to place any bets. We thought we had them\nlicked when we got the destroyer and now look at us.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm willing to try an attack, or at least a reconnaissance of\nthem,\" said the captain. \"Just now we're in the position of an armed\nexploring party. The Australian government has sent out several ships to\nsee what it could find on the other continents. After the comet struck\nall the cables went dead. We got into radio communication with the Dutch\ncolonial stations at Batavia and later with South Africa, but the rest\nof the world is just being re-explored and my commission authorizes me\nto resist unfriendly acts. I think you could call an incendiary bomb an\nunfriendly act.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis eyes twinkled over this mild witticism, and the party broke up with\na scraping of chairs. A couple of hours later, the blue line of Sandy\nHook was visible, and then the vague cliffs of the New York skyscrapers.\nThe clouds had cleared away after the rain of the last few days; not\neven a speck of mist hung in the air and everything stood out bright and\nclear. The colonists felt a pang of emotion grip them as they watched\nthe tall towers of the city rise over the horizon, straight and\nbeautiful as they had always stood, but now without a sign of life or\nmotion, all the busy clamor of the place hushed forever.\n\nOf the tetrapteryxes or \"dodos\" as the Australian had called them, there\nwas no sign. The sky bent high, unbrokenly blue, not a flicker of motion\nin it. Murray Lee felt someone stir at his side and looked round.\n\n\"Oh, damn,\" said Gloria Rutherford, \"it's so beautiful that I want to\ncry. Did you ever feel like that?\"\n\nHe nodded silently.... \"And those birds--isn't it a shame somehow that\nthey should have the most beautiful city in the world?\"\n\nThe shrill of a whistle cut off his words. With marvelous, machine-like\nprecision, the sailors moved about the decks. The _Brisbane_ lost way,\ncame to a halt, and there was a rush of steel as the anchor ran out.\nCaptain Entwhistle came down from the bridge.\n\n\"I don't see anything of your dodos yet,\" he said. \"Do you think it\nwould be wise to send out a landing party, Mr. Ruby?\"\n\n\"Most certainly not,\" said Ben. \"You don't know what you're up against\nyet. Wait till they come round. You'll have plenty to do.\"\n\nThe captain shrugged. Evidently he was not at all unwilling to match the\nAustralian navy against anything the dodos might do. \"Very well, I'll\naccept your advice for the present, Mr. Ruby. It is near evening in any\ncase. But if there is no sign of them in the morning, I propose to land\nand look over the city.\"\n\nBut the landing was never accomplished.\n\nFor, in the middle of the night, as Ben, Murray and Gloria were seated\nin the chartroom of the ship, chatting with the young lieutenant on duty\nthere, there came a quick patter of feet on the deck, and a shout of\n\"Light, ho!\"\n\n\"There are your friends now, I'll wager,\" said the lieutenant. \"Now\nwatch us go get 'em. If you want to see the fun, better go up on the\nbridge. All we do here is wrestle slide-rules.\"\n\nHastily the three climbed the bridge, where a little group of officers\nwas clustered. Following the direction in which they were looking, they\nsaw, just above the buildings on the Jersey shore, what looked like a\ntall electric sign, burning high in the air and some distance away, with\nno visible means of support.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" asked Captain Entwhistle, turning and\nthrusting a pair of glasses into Ben's hands. Through them he could read\nthe letters. Printed in capitals, though too small to be read from the\nship with the naked eye, he saw:\n\n\"SOFT MEN EXIT. HARD MEN ARE WORKERS BELONGING. MUST RETURN. THIS MEANS\nYOU.\"\n\n\"Looks like a dumb joke by someone who doesn't know English very well,\"\nhe opined, passing the glasses to Gloria. \"I don't think those birds\nwould figure that out anyway.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, though,\" said Gloria, as she read the letters. \"Remember\nthey caught Dangerfield and Farrelly and the rest. Maybe they taught\nthem how to speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, but those two didn't know anything about 'soft men.' It's all\ncrazy, like Tweedledum and Tweedledee. And what do they mean by\n'belonging'? None of our gang thought up that bright remark.\"\n\n\"Look, sir,\" said one of the younger officers, \"it's changing.\"\n\nAbruptly the lights were blotted out, to reappear, amid a swimming of\ncolors, nearer and larger. \"WARNING\" they read this time, \"FLY AWAY\nACCURSED PLACE.\"\n\n\"What beats me,\" said Ben, \"is what makes that light. I'll bet a dollar\nagainst a dodo-feather it isn't electrical and fireworks wouldn't hang\nin the air like that. How do they do it?\"\n\n\"Well, we'll soon find out,\" said the Captain, practically. \"Mr.\nSturgis, switch on searchlights three and four and turn them on the\nsource of that light.\"\n\nA few quick orders and two long beams of light leaped out from the ship\ntoward the source of the mysterious sky-writing--leaped, but not fast\nenough, for even as the searchlights sought for their goal the lights\nwere extinguished and the long beams swung across nothing but the empty\nheavens.\n\nGloria shivered. \"I think I want to go away from this place,\" she said.\n\"There's too much we don't know about around here. We'll be getting\ntable-tappings next.\"\n\n\"Apparently someone wants us to clear out,\" said Captain Entwhistle\ncheerfully. \"Mr. Sturgis, get steam on three boilers and send the men to\nreserve action stations. We may have something doing here before\nmorning.\"\n\nOrders were shouted, iron doors were slammed and feet pattered in the\ninterior of the warship. From their station on the bridge Ben, Gloria\nand Murray could see the long shafts of the turret guns swing upward to\ntheir steepest angle, then turn toward the Jersey shore. The _Brisbane_\nwas preparing for emergencies.\n\nBut there was to be no fight that night, though all night long the weary\nsailors stood or slept beside their guns. The dark skies remained\ninscrutable; the mysterious lights did not reappear.\n\nAt four o'clock, Captain Entwhistle had retired, reappearing at eight,\nfresh as though he had slept through the whole night. The colonists, of\ncourse, did not need sleep, but while the sailors stared at them,\nsubmitted themselves to an electric meal from one of the ship's dynamos.\nMorning found them gathering about the upper decks, eager for action,\nparticularly McAllister, who had spent most of the night engaged in\nhighly technical discussions of the _Brisbane's_ artillery with one of\nthe turret-captains.\n\n\"What do you suggest?\" asked the captain. \"Shall we land a party?\"\n\n\"I hate to go without taking a poke at those birds,\" said Ben, \"but\nstill I don't think it would be safe--\"\n\n\"What's the matter with that airplane?\" asked Gloria, pointing to the\ncatapult between the funnels, where a couple of blue-visaged sailors had\ntaken the covering from a seaplane and were giving it a morning bath.\n\nThe captain looked at Ben. \"There may be something in that idea. What do\nyou say to a scout around? I'll let you or one of your people go as an\nobserver.\"\n\n\"Tickled to death,\" Ben replied. \"We never got beyond the upper part of\nthe city ourselves. The dodos were too dangerous. I'd like to find out\nwhat it's all about.\"\n\n\"How about me?\" offered Gloria.\n\n\"Nothing doing, kid. You get left this time. If those birds get after us\nwe may land in the bay with a bump and I don't want this party to lose\nits little sunshine.\"\n\n\"Up anchor!\" came the command. \"Revolutions for ten knots speed.... I'm\ngoing to head down the bay,\" he explained to the colonists. \"If anything\nhappens I want to have sea-room, particularly if they try bombing us.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, with the _Brisbane_ running into the morning\nland-breeze in an ocean smooth as glass, the catapult let go and Ben and\nthe pilot--a lad whose cheeks would have been rosy before the comet, but\nwere now a vivid blue--were shot into the air.\n\nBeneath them the panorama of New York harbor lay spread; more silent\nthan it had been at any day since Hendrick Hudson brought his\nhigh-pooped galleys into it. As they rose, Ben could make out the line\nof the river shining through the pearly haze like a silver ribbon; the\ntowers of the city tilted, then swung toward them as the aviator swept\ndown nearer for an examination. Everything seemed normal save at the\nnorth and east, where a faint smoky mist still lingered over the\nbuildings they had occupied. Of birds, or of other human occupation than\ntheir own, there was no slightest sign.\n\nA faint shout was borne to his ears above the roar of the motor and he\nsaw the pilot motioning toward a set of earphones.\n\n\"What do you say, old chap?\" asked the pilot when he had clamped them\non. \"What direction shall we explore?\"\n\nBen glanced down and around. The cruiser seemed to hang in the water, a\ntiny droplet of foam at her bow the only sign she was still in motion.\n\"Let's go up the Hudson,\" he suggested. \"They seemed to come from that\ndirection.\"\n\n\"Check,\" called the pilot, manipulating his controls. The airplane\nclimbed, swung and went on. They were over Yonkers; Ben could see a\nriver steamer at the dock, where she had made her last halt.\n\n\"Throw in that switch ahead of you,\" came through the earphones. \"The\none marked RF. That's the radiophone for communicating with the ship. We\nmay need it.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Ben.... \"Hello.... Yes, this is Ruby, in the airplane.\nNothing to report. Everything serene. We're going to explore farther up\nthe river.\"\n\nIn the distance the Catskills loomed before them, blue and proud. Ben\nfelt a touch on his back and looked round. The pilot evidently wished\nto say something else. He cut in and heard, \"What's that off on the\nleft--right in the mountains? No, there.\"\n\nFollowing the indicated direction Ben saw something like a scar on the\nprojecting hillside--not one of the ancient rocks, but a fresh cut on\nthe earth, as though a wide spot had been denuded of vegetation.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered. \"Never saw it before. Shall we go see?...\nHello, _Brisbane_. Ruby reporting. There is a mysterious clearing in the\nCatskills. We are investigating.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Dodos are Bombing\n\n\nThe bare area seemed to run all down a long valley and spread out as it\nrounded the crest of a hill which hid what lay behind it from their\nview. As they watched a grey speck that might have been an ant at that\nheight and distance, lumbered slowly down the valley, and then Ben\nnoticed a tiny flicker of red light, so bright as to be clearly visible\neven in the day, where the grey speck moved against the hillside. A door\nseemed to open in the hillside; focusing the glasses the aviator handed\nhim, he could just make out a square, bulky object that trundled forth.\nAnd then one--two--three--four--five of the huge dodo-tetrapteryx birds\nshot out, poised for a moment, and leaped into flight.\n\n\"Hello, _Brisbane_,\" called Ben into the radiophone. \"Five dodos have\ntaken off from the cutting in the hills. I think they are after us.\nBetter turn back this way and get ready for trouble.\"\n\nThe aviator, understanding without being warned, had turned the plane.\nBen swung round to look over his shoulder. The dodos were already some\nyards in the air; behind them the bulky object was running slowly out of\nthe opening in the hillside. It had the appearance of a very long,\nflexible cannon. As he held his glasses on it, it stopped, straightened\nout and the muzzle was elevated in their direction.\n\n\"Dive!\" he shouted suddenly into the voice-tube, entirely on impulse.\nThe airplane banked sharply and seemed to drop straight down, and at the\nsame instant right through the spot where they had just passed shot a\nbeam of light so brilliant that it outshone the morning sun. There was a\nroar louder than that of the motor; the plane pitched and heaved in the\ndisturbed air, and the light-beam went off as suddenly as it had snapped\non.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you those babies were poison?\" he remarked. \"Boy, if that\never hit us!\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked the aviator's voice.\n\n\"Don't know, but it was something terrible. Let's head for home and\nmamma. I don't care about this.\"\n\nThe plane reeled as the pilot handled the controls. Rrrr! said something\nand the light-beam shot out again, just to one side this time. Out of\nthe corner of his eye Ben could see one of the birds--gaining on them!\n\n\"How do you work this machine-gun?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just squeeze the trigger. Look out! I'm going to dive her again.\"\n\nWith a roar, the light-beam let go a third time. Ben saw the edge of it\ngraze their right wing-tip; the airplane swung wildly round and down,\nwith the pilot fighting for control; the earth seemed to rush up to meet\nthem, tumbling, topsy-turvy. Ben noted a warped black spot where the\nbeam had touched the wing-tip, then surprisingly, they were flying\nalong, level with the surface of the Hudson beneath them, and hardly a\nhundred feet up.\n\n\"That was close,\" came the aviator's voice, shaky with relief. \"I\nthought they had us that time. Say, that's some ray they have.\"\n\n\"It sure is one first-class heller,\" agreed Ben. \"Are you far enough\ndown to duck it now?\"\n\n\"I think so, unless they can put it through the hills or chase us with\nit. Do you suppose those dodos thought that up themselves?\"\n\n\"Can't tell. They're right on their toes, though. Look!\" He pointed up\nand back. Silhouetted against the sky, they could see three of them,\nflying in formation like airplanes. \"Can we make it?\"\n\n\"I'm giving the old bus all she'll stand. The _Brisbane_ will come\ntoward us though. Wait till those guys get going. They'll find we can\ntake a trick or two.\"\n\nYonkers again. Ben looked anxiously over his shoulder. The three\nsilhouettes were a trifle nearer. Would they do it? 125th Street and the\nlong bridge swung into view, then Riverside Drive and the procession of\ndocks with the rusting liners lying beside them. Ben waggled the\nmachine-gun, tried to adjust its sights and squeezed the trigger. A\nlittle line of smoke-puffs leaped forth. Tracer bullets--but nowhere\nnear the birds. On and on--lower New York--the Battery. Wham! The water\nbeneath and behind them boiled. Ben looked up. The birds were above\nthem, too high to be reached, dropping bombs.\n\n\"All right, old soaks,\" he muttered, \"keep that up. You'll never hit us\nthat way.\"\n\nAgain something struck the water beneath them. The airplane pitched and\nswerved as the pilot changed course to disturb the aim of the bombers.\nIn the distance the form of the cruiser could be seen now, heading\ntoward them. As he watched, there was a flash from her foredeck. Up in\nthe blue above them appeared the white burst of a shell, then another\nand another.\n\nOne of the dodos suddenly dived out of the formation, sweeping down more\nswiftly than Ben would have believed possible. He swung the gun this way\nand that, sending out streams of tracers, but the bird did not appear to\nheed. Closer--closer--and then with a crash something burst right behind\nhim. The airplane gyrated; the water rushed upward. The end? he thought,\nand wondered inconsequentially whether his teeth would rust. The next\nmoment the water struck them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Ben Ruby came to, he beheld a ceiling which moved jerkily to and\nfro and stared lazily at it, wondering what it was. Then memory returned\nwith a snap; he sat up and looked about him. He was in one of those\ncubby-holes which are called \"cabins\" on warships, and alone. Beneath\nhim he could hear the steady throb of the engines; at his side was a\nsmall table with a wooden rack on it, in one compartment of which stood\na glass, whose contents, on inspection, proved to be oil. He drank it,\nlooked at and felt of himself, and finding nothing wrong, got out of the\nhammock and stepped to the door. A seaman was on guard in the corridor.\n\n\"Where is everybody?\"\n\n\"On deck, sir. I hope you are feeling all right now sir.\"\n\n\"Top of the world, thanks. Is the aviator O.K.?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. This way.\"\n\nHe ascended to the bridge, to be greeted riotously by the assembled\ncompany. The _Brisbane_ was steaming steadily along in the open sea,\nwith no speck of land in sight and no traces of the giant birds.\n\n\"What happened?\" Ben asked. \"Did you get rid of 'em?\"\n\n\"I think so. We shot down two and the rest made off after trying to bomb\nus. What did you two find out?\"\n\nBen briefly described their experiences. \"I thought there was something\nwrong with one of your wingtips,\" said the captain, \"but your plane sank\nso quickly after being hit that we didn't have time to examine it. That\nlight-ray cannon of theirs sounds serious. Do you suppose the dodos\nmanaged it?\"\n\n\"Can't tell,\" said Ben. \"From what I could make out through the glasses,\nit didn't look like birds that were handling it.\"\n\n\"But what could it be?\"\n\n\"Ask me! Delirium tremens, I guess. Nothing in this world is like what\nit ought to be any more. Where did those birds come from; how did we get\nthis way, all of us; who is it up there in the Catskills that don't like\nus? Answer me those and I'll tell you who was handling the gun.\"\n\n\"Message, sir,\" said a sailor, touching his cap, and handing a folded\npaper. The captain read it, frowning.\n\n\"There you are--\" he extended the sheet to Ben. \"My government is\nrecalling all ships. Our sister-ship, the _Melbourne_, has been attacked\noff San Francisco and severely damaged by bomb-dropping dodos, and they\nhave made a mass descent on Sumatra. Gentlemen, this has all the\ncharacteristics of a formal war.\" He strode off to give the necessary\norders to hurry the cruiser home, but Walter Beeville, who had joined\nthe group at the bridge, said under his breath:\n\n\"If those birds have enough intelligence to plan out anything like that\nI'll eat my hat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If you were not before my eyes,\" said Sir George Graham Harris,\npresident of the Australian Scientific Commission, \"as living proof of\nwhat you say, and if our biological and metallurgical experts did not\nreport that your physiology is utterly beyond their comprehension, I do\nnot know but that I would believe you were some cleverly constructed\nmachines, actuated in some way by radio. However, that is not the\npoint ... I have here a series of reports from different quarters on\nsuch explorations as have been made since the arrival of the comet and\nour recovery from its effects. We are, it appears, confronted with a\nmenace of considerable seriousness in the form of these birds.\n\n\"In the light of your closer acquaintance with them and with conditions\ngenerally in the devastated areas, they may be more suggestive to you\nthan to us.\" He stopped and ruffled over the papers piled beside him at\nthe big conference table. He was a kindly old gentleman, whose white Van\nDyke and pale blue lips contrasted oddly with the almost indigo tint of\nhis visage (before the comet it had been a rich wine-red, the result of\na lifelong devotion to brandy and soda). Smiling round the table at his\nscientific colleagues and at Ben, Murray, Gloria and Beeville, who\noccupied the position of honor, he went on:\n\n\"I give you mainly excerpts.... The first is from the South African\ngovernment. They have ... hm, hm ... sent an aerial expedition\nnorthward, all lines of communication appearing to be broken. At\nNairobi, they report for the first time, finding a town entirely\nunoccupied and its inhabitants turned into cast-metal statues ... Addis\nAbaba the same ... Wadi Hafa likewise. Twenty miles north of Wadi Hafa\nthey noted the first sign of life--a bird of some kind at a considerable\ndistance to the west of them and flying parallel with them and very\nrapidly.\"\n\nThe scientist looked up. \"It would appear beyond doubt that this bird\nbelonged to the species we call dodos and to which Dr. Beeville has\ngiven the excellent scientific name, tetrapteryx.... As the expedition\nproceeded northward, they encountered more of them; sometimes as many as\nfour being in sight at one time. At Alexandria, where they halted for\nsupplies, the dodos closed in. When the expedition took the air again\nwith the object of flying to Crete and thence to Europe, these\nremarkable avians came very close, apparently trying to turn the\nexpedition back. They reached Crete that afternoon, in spite of the\ninterference of the birds, but that night were actively attacked on the\nground. The phenomena that accompanied all other attacks were observed;\nthe birds used incendiary bombs of great intensity. One machine was\nentirely destroyed with its aviators. The others, since their object was\nexploration, at once took to the air and returned.\n\n\"Any comments, gentlemen? No? Well the next is the report of the Dutch\nship _Corlaer_, which attempted to reach Japan. She was permitted to\nproceed to within a few miles of the islands, and then began to receive\nlight-warnings in the sky, such as Captain Entwhistle reports.\nUnfortunately they were in Japanese characters and there was no one\naboard who could read them. She put in at the port of Nagasaki and sent\nout a landing party. It never returned; as in the other cases the ship\nwas bombed at night and only made Sumatra with the greatest difficulty,\none of the bombs having fallen on the quarter-deck, wrecking the\nsteering-gear and causing extensive internal damage....\n\n\"There are minor reports with which I will not bother you. But the\nreport of H. M. A. S. _Melbourne_ appears highly significant. She\ntouched at several South American ports. In the cities she reports\nfinding all life at a standstill, although at Iquique, the landing party\nencountered some hill-Indians who had suffered a bluing of the blood\nsimilar to ours, and who proved distinctly unfriendly. They are reported\nas engaged in looting the city and getting drunk on the contents of the\nbodegas.\n\n\"North of Callao she found no signs of life until she reached San Pedro\nBay. There a man was observed to be waving from the beach. The\n_Melbourne_ put in and launched a boat, but before it reached shore, one\nof the birds made its appearance overhead and the man disappeared into\nthe trees and was not seen again. From the ship he appeared to be a\nmechanical man, such as you. Shortly afterward, the _Melbourne_ began to\nsee the dodos constantly, and at the region of San Francisco, she saw\none of the light signals. The wording of it was: 'DEPART AWAY FAREWELL\nFOREVER.'\"\n\nGloria stirred and Sir George looked at her with mild eyes. \"Nothing,\nsir. I was just thinking that these dodos are uncommonly poetical. They\ntold us to fly from the accursed place.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.... Naturally the _Melbourne_, not anticipating any trouble as\nthe result of a refusal to obey this absurd command, did not heed the\nwarning, and steamed into the bay. Like the other ships she was attacked\nat night. One of the bombs fell on the fire-control station and wrecked\nit, bringing down the tripod mast and fusing the top of the conning\ntower. She got under way immediately and replied with all guns, but\nbefore escaping number three turret was struck by another bomb and all\nthe men in the turret were killed. The roof of the turret was driven in\nand even the breeches of the guns melted.... That, I think, summarizes\nthe reports we have. We have seen a little of the birds, mostly at a\ndistance, and they appear to have carried off several individuals,\nespecially in Sumatra. I am afraid that is all we can offer.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Well, what the material in the bombs is I can't say,\" said Ben, \"but\nthey know all about projecting it from guns in the form of a beam. I\ntold you about my experience in company with the aviator from the\n_Brisbane_?\"\n\n\"The eggs Roberts found, too,\" said Gloria.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Dr. Beeville can tell you about that.\"\n\n\"Why, there's nothing much to it,\" said the scientist. \"One of our\npeople found what appeared to be a nest of these birds in a building.\nThe nest was built of soft cloths and contained large eggs, but when the\nplace was revisited the eggs had been removed.... I may say that I have\nexamined the remains of one rather badly mangled specimen. The\nbrain-case is extraordinarily large--larger than I have ever seen in any\nanimal, and they appear to be of a high order of intelligence.\n\n\"On the other hand I should certainly put the use and control of such a\nmaterial as these bombs contain beyond their powers. And the fact that\nthe nest was found in a building would indicate that the headquarters in\nthe Catskills were used by some other and higher intelligence which was\nseparate from and perhaps in control of these birds. Moreover, they do\nnot appear to wish to destroy us mechanical men, but to carry us off,\nand the messages seen by the ships seem to indicate that the\nintelligence behind these birds is capable of reading and understanding\nEnglish. I cannot conceive that the birds themselves would be able to do\nthis.\n\n\"Further, there is the very strong evidence of the gun which fired on\nMr. Ruby. In every case where these birds have attacked man, they have\nused bombs of this material put up in portable form, although the gun\nwould have been much more effective. It would have gone right through\nthe _Melbourne_ or the _Brisbane_ like a red-hot poker through a board.\nFrom this I argue that the birds are directed rather than directing, and\nthat the directing intelligence is either too indolent or too\ncontemptuous of us to attack man except through their agency. Finally, I\ndeduce that we are dealing with some powerful and as yet unknown form of\nlife. What it is or how it reached the earth, I am not prepared to say.\"\n\n\"Wunnerful,\" said Gloria irreverently, and a smile passed across the\nfaces of the conferees.\n\n\"But what are the bombs made of and what makes them tick?\" asked Murray\nLee.\n\n\"That is a question to which I would very much like to know the answer,\"\nsaid Sir George, stroking his white beard. \"Perhaps Mr. Nasmith, our\nchemical member, will be good enough to give us something on the point.\"\n\n\"Not much,\" said Nasmith, a lantern-jawed man with black hair. \"We made\na chemical analysis of the portions of the _Melbourne_ which had been\nstruck by the bombs, and all we can say is that it gave a most\nextraordinary result. These portions were originally made of Krupp armor\nsteel, as you know. Our analysis showed the presence of a long series of\nchemical elements, including even gold and thorium, most of them in\nminute quantities. Titanium appeared to be the leading constituent after\niron.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Sir George, \"the situation appears to be this. We don't\nknow what the dodos are or what is behind them, but they have possession\nof a large part of the world to which they are disposed to forbid us\nany access. They have powerful weapons and the intelligence to use them,\nand they appear to be unfriendly. I suggest that the sense of this\nmeeting is that the government should take immediate measures of\ninvestigation and if necessary, of hostility.\"\n\n\"Swell,\" said Gloria, \"only you didn't go half far enough. We've been\nthere and you haven't. You want to get the best guns you've got and go\nfor them right away.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of approval. As Sir George rose to put the question\nto a vote there came a knock at the door. Heads were turned to greet a\nyoung man who hurried to the president and whispered something. Sir\nGeorge turned to the meeting with a startled face.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"the dodos are bombing Canberra, the\ncapital of Australia, and are being engaged by the Australian air\nforce.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Opening of the Conflict\n\n\n\"I'm glad,\" said Gloria to Murray Lee, as they leaned against the rail\nof the steamer _Paramatta_ in their new American Army uniforms, \"that\nthey're going to attack these things in the old U. S. I'd hate like\nanything to think we last Americans were shoved out of our country by a\nlot of chickens.\"\n\nMurray glanced around him. In every direction the long lines of the\nconvoy stretched out, big liners loaded to the funnels with men, guns,\ntanks and ammunition. On the fringes of the troopships the sleek grey\nsides of the cruisers and destroyers that protected them were visible,\nand overhead there soared an armada of fast airplanes--no mere\nobservation machines, or peaceful explorers like the South Africans, but\nfierce, deadly fighting planes, rocket-powered, which could step along\nat four miles a minute and climb, dive and maneuver better than a dodo.\n\nHe nodded. \"You said something, sister. Say won't it be great to take a\nwhack at them under the Stars and Stripes. I'm glad they let us do it,\neven if there are only fourteen of us.\"\n\nIn the four months since the conference with the Australian Scientific\nCommittee it had been amply demonstrated to the three remaining\ngovernments of the world that there was not room for both man and dodos\non the same planet. A carefully-worked out campaign had evidently been\nset in operation by whatever central intelligence led the four-winged\nbirds with the object of wiping human life from the earth. The bombing\nof Canberra was merely the first blow.\n\nWhile Australia was arming and organizing to meet the menace the second\nblow fell--on Sourabaya, the great metropolis of Java, which was wiped\nout in a single night. At this evidence of the hostile intentions of the\ndodos radio apparatus began to tap in Australia, in the Dutch colonies\nand in South Africa; old guns forgotten since the last great war, were\nwheeled out; the factories began to turn out fighting airplanes and the\nyoung men drilled in the parks.\n\nWhen, late in November, a flock of twenty-five dodos was observed over\nnorth Australia, headed for Sydney, the forces of the defence were on\ntheir guard. Long before the birds reached the town they were met by a\nbig squadron of rocket-powered fighting planes and in a desperate battle\nover the desert, with claw and beak and bomb against machine-gun, were\nshot down to the last bird. With that the attacks had suddenly ceased,\nand the federated governments, convinced that it was but the calm\nbefore a greater storm, had gathered their strength for a trial of arms.\n\nIt was realized that whatever lay behind this attempt to conquer all\nthere was left of the old earth must be in some way due to the coming of\nthe great comet and must center somewhere in America, where the comet\nhad struck. So for the first time the race of man began to learn what\ninternational cooperation meant. Delegates from the three surviving\ngovernments met in conference at Perth with Ben Ruby accorded a place as\nthe representative of the United States. The decision of the conference\nwas to mobilize every man and weapon to attack the birds in America and\nexterminate them there if possible; if impossible to do this, then to\nkeep them so occupied at home that they would be unable to deliver any\ncounter-attack.\n\nThere was plenty of shipping to carry an army far larger than the\nfederated governments could mobilize; the main weakness of the\nexpedition lay in the lack of naval protection, for the great navies of\nthe world had perished when the northern hemisphere passed under the\ninfluence of the comet. It was sought to make up for this deficiency by\na vast cloud of airplanes, flying from the decks of many merchant ships,\nconverted into aircraft carriers, though some of the new rocket-planes\nwere powerful enough to cruise around the world under their own power.\nAnd so, on this March morning in 1947 the whole vast armada was crossing\nthe Atlantic toward the United States. In view of the fact that the\nheadquarters of the dodos seemed to be somewhere in the Catskills, it\nhad been decided to land in New Jersey, form a base there and work\nnorthward.\n\nIn the preliminary training for the coming conflict the metal Americans\nhad played an important part. Their construction made them impossible as\naviators, which they would have preferred. But quite early it was\ndiscovered that they made ideal operators for tanks. The oil fumes and\nthe lack of air did not in the least affect beings to whom breathing had\nbecome unimportant, and the oil was actually a benefit.\n\nAs a result the little American army had been composed of fourteen tanks\nof a special type, fitted at the direction of the military experts, with\nall the latest and best in scientific devices. They were given\nextra-heavy armor, fitted in two thicknesses, with a chamber between, as\na protection against the light-bombs, and each tank, intended to be\nhandled by a single operator, was provided with one heavy gun, so\narranged that it could be used against aerial attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA stir of motion was visible at the head of the convoy. A destroyer\ndashed past the _Paramatta_, smoke pouring from her funnels, the white\nbow-wave rising as high as her bridge as she put on full speed. From the\nairplane carrier just behind them in the line, one, two, three flights\nof fighters swung off, circled a moment to gain altitude and then\nwhirled off to the north and west.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Gloria.\n\nA sailor touched his cap. \"Sighted a dodo, I believe, miss,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, boy,\" said Gloria, \"here we go. What would you give to be in one of\nthose planes?\"\n\nThey craned their necks eagerly, but nothing was visible except a few\nflecks in the sky that might be dodos or might equally well be\nairplanes. Faint and far, a rattle of machine-guns drifted down; there\nwas a flash of intense light, like the reflection in a far-distant\nmirror, and the machine-guns ceased. A few moments later the airplanes\ncame winging back to their mother ship. A sailor on her deck began to\nswing his arms in the curious semaphore language of the sea.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Gloria of the man by their side.\n\n\"I'm trying to make out, miss. One dodo, he says, carrying a\nbomb--hit--by--machine-gun.... Oh, the bomb went off in the dodo's claws\nand blew him all to pieces.\"\n\nThe echo of a cheer came across the water from the other ships. The\nfirst brush had gone in favor of the race of man!\n\nThat night dodos announced their presence by a few bombs dropped\ntentatively among the ships, but did no damage, being so hurried and\nharried by the airmen, and by morning the dream-towers of Atlantic City,\nnecked with the early morning sun, rose out of the west. Far in the\ndistance the aviators of the expedition had spied more of the birds, but\nafter the first day's encounter with the airplanes they kept a healthy\ndistance, apparently contented to observe what they could.\n\nAs ship after ship swung in toward the piers and discharged its cargo of\nmen, guns and munitions, the birds became bolder, as though to inspect\nwhat was going on. But the Australian aviators attacked them fiercely,\ndriving them back at every attempt to pierce the aerial cordon, and when\nnight came on, nearly a third of the force had been landed and quartered\nin parts of the one-time pleasure city.\n\nCovered by the darkness a few dodos came down to drop bombs that night.\nThey met with poor success. Delicate listening apparatus, intended\noriginally to pick up the sound of approaching enemy airplanes had been\none of the first things landed. The whir of the birds' wings was plainly\naudible, and before they had realized that man had a weapon to meet\ntheir night attacks half a dozen of them had been caught in the bursts\nof anti-aircraft guns and more had been met and shot down by the\nnight-patrolling airmen.\n\nThe next morning saw the unloading beginning anew, while the emptied\ntransports were taken around into Delaware Bay. Fortunately, the weather\ncontinued unusually fine for late March, bright with sunshine, giving\nthe dodos no opportunity to attack behind the cover of clouds. There was\njust enough cold in the air to make the Australians and South Africans\nlively, though the Americans found the temperature caused the oil to\nmove sluggishly in their metallic joints.\n\nAt daybreak the whole American unit had been pushed out to the railroad\nline at Greenwood with the advance guard of tanks, and finding no\nopposition they continued on to Farmington, where there was an airport\nthat would serve for the leading squadrons of planes.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Ben to Murray, \"I wish those dodos would show a\nlittle more pep. Fighting them is no cinch. We're a little ahead of the\ngame now, but it's largely because they've let us alone and haven't\nbrought up any of those light-beam guns.\"\n\n\"Maybe we've got 'em on the run,\" replied Murray. \"You can't tell when\nanyone will develop a yellow streak, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we've seen enough of these babies to know they haven't got a\nyellow streak a millimeter wide in their whole make-up. Yet here they\nlet us do just about as we please. Makes me think they're just laying\nfor us, and when they get us where they want us--zowie!\"\n\n\"Mebbe so, mebbe so,\" replied Murray. \"Beeville still thinks it isn't\nthe birds at all; that they've got a big boss somewhere running the\nwhole works and till we find out what's behind it we're fighting in the\ndark. Well, they'll unload the rest of the army tomorrow and then we'll\nget down to cases.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe country between Atlantic City and Philadelphia is flat, with a few\ngentle elevations and dotted with small towns, farms and tiny bits of\nwoodland. In the cold spring morning of the next day, with rain\nportended, the army of the federated governments pushed out along the\nroads through this land like a huge, many-headed snake, tanks and\nairplanes in the lead, the steady ranks of infantry and the big guns\ncoming behind. Back at Atlantic City all machine-shops and factories had\nbeen set in operation and wrecking crews were already clearing the\nrailroads and mounting huge long-range guns on trucks, preparatory to\ncovering the advance. All along the route was bustle and hurry; camp\nkitchens rumbled along, harassed officers galloped up and down the lines\non their horses (now, like their masters with a strange bluish cast of\nskin) and messengers rushed to and fro on popping motorcycles.\n\nOut with the advance the American division of fourteen tanks rolled\nalong. The dodos seemed to have completely disappeared, even the\nscouting aviators, far ahead, reporting no sign of them. The army was\nsucceeding in establishing itself on American soil.\n\nBut around noon a \"stop\" signal flashed on the control boards of the\ntanks. They halted at the crest of a little rise and climbed out to look\naround.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked someone.\n\n\"Perhaps gentlemanly general wishes to disport in surf,\" suggested\nYoshio, with his flashing, steel-toothed smile, \"and proceeding is\nretained without presence.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Gloria, \"but I'll bet a dollar to a handful of blue\nkangaroos that the dodos are getting in their licks somewhere.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll soon know,\" said Murray Lee. \"Here comes a dispatch rider.\"\n\nThe man on the motorcycle dashed up, saluted. \"General Ruby?\" he\ninquired, and handed the dispatch to Ben. The latter read it, then\nmotioned the others about him.\n\n\"Well, here it is, folks,\" he said, \"Listen to this--'General Grierson\nto General Ruby. Our flank guard was heavily attacked at Atsion this\nmorning. The Third Brigade of the Fourteenth Division has suffered\nheavy loss and has been forced back to Chew Road. We are bringing up\nheavy artillery. The enemy appear to be using large numbers of light-ray\nguns. Advance guard is recalled to Waterford in support of our left\nflank.'\"\n\n\"Oh--oh,\" said somebody.\n\n\"I knew they'd start giving us hell sooner or later,\" remarked Murray\nLee as he climbed into his tank.\n\nAt Waterford there was ordered confusion when they arrived. Just outside\nthe town a long line of infantrymen were plying pick and shovel in the\nformation of a system of trenches. Machine-gun units were installing\nthemselves in stone or brick buildings and constructing barricades\naround their weapons; line after line of tanks had wheeled into position\nunder cover of woods or in the streets of the town, the little whippets\nout in front, fast cruiser-tanks behind them and the lumbering\nbattle-tanks with their six-inch guns, farther back.\n\nArtillery was everywhere, mostly in little pits over which the gunners\nwere spreading green strips of camouflage. As the American tanks rolled\nup, a battery of eight-inch howitzers behind a railroad embankment at\nthe west end of the town was firing slowly and with an air of great\nsolemnity at some target in the invisible distance, the angle of their\nmuzzles showing that they were using the extreme range. A couple of\nairplanes hummed overhead. But of dead or wounded, of dodos or any other\nenemy there was no sign. It might have been a parade-war, an elaborately\nrealistic imitation of the real thing for the movies.\n\nGuides directed the Americans to a post down the line toward Chew Road.\n\"What's the news?\" asked Ben of an officer whose red tabs showed he\nbelonged to the staff.\n\n\"They hit the right wing at Atsion,\" replied the officer. \"Just what\nhappened, I'm not sure. Somebody said they had a lot of those light-ray\nguns and they just crumpled up our flank like that.\" He slapped his\nhands together to show the degree of crumpling the right flank had\nendured. \"We lost about fifteen hundred men in fifteen minutes. Tanks,\ntoo. But I think we're stopping them now.\"\n\n\"Any dodos?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"Just a few. The airplanes shot down a flock of seven just before the\nbattle and after that they kept away.... What is it? General\nWitherington wants me? Oh, all right, I'll come. Excuse me, sir,\" and\nthe staff officer was off.\n\nMost of the afternoon was spent in an interminable period of waiting and\nwatching the laboring infantry sink themselves into the ground. About\nfour o'clock a fine, cold drizzle began to fall. The Americans sought\nthe shelter of their tanks, and about the same time their radiophones\nflashed the order to move up, toward the north and east through a barren\npasture with a few trees in it, to the crest of a low hill. It was\nalready nearly dark; the tanks bumped unevenly over the stony ground,\ntheir drivers following each other by the black silhouettes in the\ngloom. Off to the right a battery suddenly woke to a fever of activity,\nthen as rapidly became silent and in the intervals of silence between\nthe motor-sounds the Americans could catch the faint rat-tat of\nmachine-guns in the heavens above. Evidently dodos were abroad in the\ngloom.\n\nAt the crest of the hill they could see across a flat valley in the\ndirection of Chew Road. Something seemed to be burning behind the next\nrise; a ruddy glare lit the clouds. Down the line guns began to growl\nagain, and the earth trembled gently with the sound of an explosion\nsomewhere in the rear. Murray Lee, sitting alone at the controls of his\ntank. So this was war!\n\nThere were trees along their ridge, and looking through the side\npeep-hole of his tank Murray could make out the vague forms of a line of\nwhippets among them, waiting, like themselves, for the order to advance.\nHe wondered what the enemy were like; evidently not all dodos, since so\nmany tanks had been pushed up to the front. This argued a man or animal\nthat ran along the ground. The dodos seemed to spend most of their time\nin the air....\n\nHe was recalled from his meditations by the ringing of the attention\nbell and the radiophone began to speak rapidly:\n\n\"American tank division--enemy tanks reported approaching. Detain them\nas long as possible and then retire. Your machines are not to be\nsacrificed; Radio your positions with reference to Clark Creek as you\nretire for guidance of artillery registering on enemy tanks. There--\"\n\nThe voice broke off in mid-sentence. So the dodos had tanks! Murray Lee\nsnapped in his controls and glanced forward. Surely in the gloom along\nthat distant ridge there was a darker spot--next to the\nhouse--something.\n\nSuddenly, with a roar like a thousand thunders, a bolt of sheer light\nseemed to leap from the dark shape on the opposite hill, straight toward\nthe trees where Murray had noticed the whippets. He saw one of the trees\nleap into vivid flame from root to branch as the beam struck it; saw a\nwhippet, sharply outlined in the fierce glow, its front armor-plate\ncaving; then its ammunition blew up in a shower of sparks, and he was\nfrantically busy with his own controls and gun.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHopelessness\n\n\nAll along the line of the American tanks the guns flamed; flame-streaked\nfountains of dirt leaped up around the dark shape on the opposite hill\nand a burst of fire came from the farmhouse beside it as a misdirected\nshell struck it somewhere.\n\nThe beam from the unknown enemy snapped off as suddenly as it had come\non, leaving, like lightning, an aching of the eyes behind it. Murray Lee\nswung his tank round, making for the reverse slope of the hill to avoid\nthe light-beam. Crack! The beam came on again--right overhead this time.\nIt flashed through the tree-tops leaving a trail of fire. He heard a\ntorn branch bang on the roof of his tank, manipulated the gun to fire at\nthe source of the beam and discovered that the magazine was empty. As he\nbent to snap on the automatic shell-feeding device, a searchlight from\nsomewhere lashed out toward the black shape that opposed them, then went\noff. In the second's glimpse it afforded the enemy appeared as a huge,\npolished, fish-shaped object, its mirror-like sides unscarred by the\nbombardment it had passed through, its prow bearing a long, prehensible\nsnout--apparently the source of the light-beam.\n\nSuddenly a shell screamed overhead and the whole scene leaped into\ndazzling illumination as it burst just between the enemy tanks and their\nown. It must be a shell from the dodos! The federated armies had no\nshells that dissolved into burning light like that. Then another and\nanother, a whole chorus of shells, falling in the village behind them.\nMurray had a better look at their opponent in the light. It seemed to\nlie flush with the ground; there was no visible means of either support\nor propulsion. It was all of twenty feet in diameter, widest near the\nhead, tapering backward. The questing snout swung to and fro, fixed its\nposition and discharged another of those lightning-bolts. Off to the\nright came the answering crash as it caved in the armor of another of\nthe luckless whippets. He aimed his gun carefully at the base of the\nsnout and pulled the trigger; on the side of the monster there appeared\na flash of flame as the shell exploded, then a bright smear of metal--a\ndirect hit, and not the slightest damage!\n\nBen Ruby's voice came through the radiophone, cool and masterful. \"Pull\nout, folks, our guns are no good against that baby. I'm cutting off;\nradio positions back to the heavy artillery. Put the railroad guns on.\"\n\nMurray glanced through the side peep-hole again--one, two, three, four,\nfive--all the American tanks seemed undamaged. The monster had confined\nits attention to the whippets, apparently imagining they were doing the\nshooting. He pulled his throttle back, shot the speed up, rumbling down\nthe hill, toward the village. As he looked back, darkness had closed in;\nthe brow of the hill, its rows of trees torn and broken by the\nlight-beam stood between him and the enemy. Before him amid the flaring\nlight of the enemy shells was a stir of movement, the troops seemed to\nbe pulling out also.\n\nThe tanks rumbled through the streets of Waterford and came to a halt on\na corner behind a stone church which held three machine-gun nests.\nMurray could see one of the gunners making some adjustment by the light\nof a pocket torch and a wave of pity for the brave man whose weapon was\nas useless as a stick swept over him.\n\nA messenger dashed down the street, delivered his missive to someone,\nand out of the shadows a file of infantry suddenly popped up and began\nto stream back, getting out of range. Then, surrounded by bursts of\nartillery fire, illumined by the glare of half a dozen searchlights that\nflickered restlessly on and off, the strange thing came over the brow of\nthe hill.\n\nIt halted for a moment, its snout moving about uneasily as though it\nwere smelling out the way, and as it did so, it was joined by a second.\nNeither of them seemed to be in the least disturbed by the shells all\nthe way from light artillery to six-inch, that were bursting about them,\nfilling the air with singing fragments. For a moment they stood at ease,\nthen the left-hand one, the one that had led the advance, pointed its\nsnout at the village and discharged one of its flaming bolts. It struck\nsquarely in the center of an old brick house, whose cellar had been\nturned into a machine-gun nest. With a roar, the building collapsed, a\nbright flicker of flames springing out of the ruins. As though it were a\nsignal every machine-gun, every rifle in the village opened fire on the\nimpassive shapes at the crest of the hill. The uproar was terrific; even\nin his steel cage Murray could hardly hear himself think.\n\nThe shining monster paid no more attention to it than to the rain. One\nof them slid gently forward a few yards, turned its trunk toward the\nspouting trenches, and in short bursts, loosed five quick bolts; there\nwere as many spurts of flame, a few puffs of earth and the trenches\nbecame silent, save for one agonized cry, \"First aid, for God's sake!\"\n\nBen Ruby's voice came through the microphone. \"Retreat everybody.\nAtlantic City if you can make it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a great, round fear gripping at his heart, Murray Lee threw in the\nclutch of his machine and headed in the direction he remembered as that\nof the main road through the town toward Atlantic City. The night had\nbecome inky-black; the town was in a valley and the shadow of trees and\nhouses made the darkness even more Stygian. Only by an occasional match\nor flashlight glare could the way be seen, but such light as there was\nshowed the road already filled with fugitives. Some of them were\nhelmetless, gunless, men in the last extremity of terror, running\nanywhere to escape from they knew not what.\n\nBut through the rout there plowed a little company of infantry, revealed\nin a shell-burst, keeping tight ranks as though at drill, officers at\nthe head, not flying, but retreating from a lost battle with good heart\nand confidence, ready to fight again the next day. The dancing beam of a\nsearchlight picked them out for a moment; Murray Lee looked at them and\nthe fear died within him. He slowed up his machine, ran it off the road\nand out to the left where there seemed to be a clearing that opened in\nthe direction of the town. After all, he could at least observe the\nprogress of the monsters and report on them.\n\nHe was astonished to find that he had come nearly a mile from the center\nof the disturbance. Down there, the glittering monsters, still brightly\nillumined by searchlight and flare, seemed to be standing still amid the\nouter houses of the town, perhaps examining the trench system the\nAustralians had dug that afternoon. The gunfire on them had ceased. From\ntime to time one of the things, perhaps annoyed at the pointlessness of\nwhat it saw, would swing its trunk around and discharge a light-bolt at\nhouse, barn or other object. The object promptly caved in, and if it\nwere wood, began to burn. A little train of the blazing remains of\nbuildings marked the progress of the shining giants, and threw a weird\nred light over the scene.\n\n[Illustration: One of the things would swing its trunk around and\ndischarge a light-bolt at a house or other object.]\n\nNow that he could see them clearly, Murray noted that they were all of\nfifty or sixty feet long. Their polished sides seemed one huge mirror,\nbright as glass, and a phosphorescent glow hung about their tails. Along\neither side was a slender projection like the bilge-keel of a ship,\nterminating about three quarters of the way along, and with a small dot\nof the phosphorescence at its tip. They seemed machines rather than\nanimate objects. Murray wondered whether they were, or (remembering his\nown evolution into a metal man) whether they were actually metal\ncreatures of some unheard-of breed.\n\nAs he watched, a battery out beyond the town that had somehow gotten\nleft behind, opened fire. He could see the red flash-flash-flash of the\nguns as they spoke; hear the explosions of the shells as they rent the\nground around the giants. One of them swung impassively toward the\nbattery; there were three quick stabs of living flame, and the guns\nceased firing. Murray Lee shuddered--were all man's resources, was all\nof man, to disappear from the earth? All his high hopes and aspirations,\nall the centuries of bitter struggle toward culture to be wiped out by\nthese impervious beasts?\n\nHe was recalled from his dream by the flash of light at his control\nboard and a voice from the radiophone \"... to all units,\" came the\nmessage. \"Railroad battery 14 about to fire on enemy tanks in Waterford.\nRequest observation for corrections ... General Stanhope to all units.\nRailroad battery 14, twelve-inch guns, about to fire on enemy tanks in\nWaterford. Request observation for correction....\"\n\n\"Lieut. Lee, American Tank Corps, to General Stanhope,\" he called into\nthe phone. \"Go ahead with railroad battery 14. Am observing fire from\neast of town.\"\n\nEven before he had finished speaking there was a dull rumble in the air\nand a tremendous heave of earth behind and to one side of the shining\nenemy, not two hundred yards away. \"Lieut. Lee to railroad battery 14,\"\nhe called, delightedly, \"two hundred yards over, ten yards right.\"\nBerrrroum! Another of the twelve-inch shells fell somewhere ahead of the\ngiants in the village. As Murray shouted the correction one of the metal\ncreatures lifted its snout toward the source of the explosion curiously\nand as if it had not quite understood its meaning, fired a light-beam at\nit. Another shell fell, just to one side. A wild hope surging in him, he\ncalled the corrections--these were heavier guns than any that had yet\ntaken a hand.\n\n\"Lieut. Lee, American Tank Corps, to railroad battery 14--Suggest you\nuse armor-piercing shell. Enemy tanks appear to be armored,\" he called\nand had the comforting reply. \"Check, Lieut. Lee. We are using\narmor-piercers.\" Slam! Another of the twelve-inch shells struck, not ten\nyards behind the enemy. The ground around them rocked; one of them\nturned as though to examine the burst, the other lifted its snout\nskyward and released a long, thin beam of blue light, not in the least\nlike the light-ray. It did not seem to occur to either of them that\nthese shells might be dangerous. They seemed merely interested.\n\nAnd then--the breathless watchers in the thickets around the doomed town\nsaw a huge red explosion, a great flower of flame that leaped to the\nheavens, covered with a cloud of thick smoke, pink in the light of the\nburning houses, and as it cleared away, there lay one of the monsters on\nits side, gaping and rent, the mirrored surface scarred across, the\nphosphorescent glow extinguished, the prehensile snout drooping\nlifelessly. Murray Lee was conscious of whooping wildly, of dancing out\nof his tank and joining someone else in an embrace of delight. They were\nnot invincible then. They could be hurt--killed!\n\n\"Hooray!\" he cried, \"Hooray!\"\n\n\"That and twelve times over,\" said his companion.\n\nThe phrase struck him as familiar; for the first time he looked at his\nfellow celebrant. It was Gloria.\n\n\"Why, where in the world did you come from?\" he asked.\n\n\"Where did you? I've been here all the time, ever since Ben ordered us\nhome. Didn't think I'd run out on all the fun, did you? Are those things\nalive?\"\n\n\"How do I know? They look it but you never can tell with all the junk\nthat comet left around the earth. They might be just some new kind of\ntank full of dodos.\"\n\n\"Yeh, but--\" The buzzing roar of one of the light-rays crashing into a\nclump of trees not a hundred yards away, recalled them to themselves.\nGloria looked up, startled. The other monster was moving slowly forward,\nsystematically searching the hillside with its weapon.\n\n\"Say, boy friend,\" she said, \"I think it's time to go away from here.\nSee you at high mass.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the conference at headquarters in Hammonton that night was anything\nbut cheerful.\n\n\"It comes to this, then,\" said General Grierson, the commander-in-chief\nof the expedition. \"We have nothing that is effective against these dodo\ntanks but the twelve-inch railroad artillery, using armor-piercing shell\nand securing a direct hit. Our infantry is worse than useless; the tanks\nare useless, the artillery cannot get through the armor of these things,\nalthough it damages the enemy artillery in the back areas.\"\n\nBen Ruby rubbed a metal chin. \"Well, that isn't quite all, sir. One of\nthe American tanks was hit and came through--damaged I will admit. The\nlightning, or light-ray these dodos threw, penetrated the outer skin but\nnot the inner. We could build more tanks of this type.\"\n\nGeneral Grierson drummed on the table. \"And arm them with what? You\ncouldn't mount a twelve-inch gun in a tank if you wanted to, and we\nhaven't any twelve-inch guns to spare.\"\n\nOne of the staff men looked up. \"Has airplane bombing been tried on\nthese--things. It seems to me that a one or two-thousand pound bomb\nwould be as effective as a twelve-inch shell.\"\n\n\"That was tried this afternoon,\" said the head of the air service, with\nan expression of pain. \"The 138th bombing squadron attacked a group of\nthese tanks. Unfortunately, the tanks kept within range of their\nlight-ray artillery and the entire squadron was shot down.\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" said the staff man. \"Let's add up the information we have secured\nso far and see where it leads. Now first they have a gun which shoots a\nray which is effective either all along its length or when put up in\npackages like a shell, and is rather like a bolt of lightning in its\neffect. Any deductions from that?\"\n\n\"Might be electrical,\" said someone.\n\n\"Also might not,\" countered Walter Beeville. \"Remember the _Melbourne's_\nturret. No electrical discharge would produce chemical changes like that\nin Krupp steel.\"\n\n\"Second,\" said the officer, \"they appear to have three main types of\nfighting machines or individuals. First, there are the dodos themselves.\nWe know all about them, and our airplanes can beat them. Good....\nSecond, there is their artillery--a large type that throws a beam of\nthis emanation and a smaller type which throws it in the form of shells.\nThirdly, there are these--tanks, which may themselves be the individuals\nwe are fighting. They are capable of projecting these discharges to a\nshort distance--something over four thousand yards, and apparently do\nnot have the power of projecting it in a prolonged beam, like their\nartillery. They are about fifty feet long, fish-shaped, heavily armored\nand have some unknown method of propulsion. Check me if I'm wrong at any\npoint.\"\n\n\"The projection of these lightning-rays would seem to indicate they are\nmachines,\" offered General Grierson hopefully.\n\n\"Not on your life,\" said Beeville, \"think of the electric eel.\"\n\n\"As I was saying,\" said the staff man, \"our chief defect seems a lack of\ninformation, and--\"\n\nGeneral Grierson brought his fist down on the table. \"Gentlemen!\" he\nsaid. \"This discussion is leading us nowhere. It's all very well to\nargue about the possibilities of man or machine in time of peace and at\nhome, but we are facing one of the greatest dangers the earth has ever\nexperienced, and must take immediate measures. Unless someone has\nsomething more fruitful to develop than this conference has provided\nthus far, I shall be forced to order the re-embarkation of what remains\nof the army and sail for home. My duty is to the citizens of the\nfederated governments, and I cannot uselessly sacrifice more lives. Our\nsupply of railroad artillery is utterly inadequate to withstand the\nnumbers of our adversaries. Has anyone anything to offer?\"\n\nThere was a silence around the conference table, a silence pregnant with\na heavy sense of defeat, for no one of them but could see the General\nwas right.\n\nBut at that moment there came a tap at the door. \"Come,\" called General\nGrierson. An apologetic under-officer entered. \"I beg your pardon, sir,\nbut one of the iron Americans is here and insists that he has something\nof vital importance for the General. He will not go away without seeing\nyou.\"\n\n\"All right. Bring him in.\"\n\nThere stepped into the room another of the mechanical Americans, but a\nman neither Ben Ruby nor Beeville had ever seen before. A stiff wire\nbrush of moustache stood out over his mouth; he wore no clothes but a\nkind of loin-cloth made, apparently, of a sheet. The metal plates of his\npowerful body glittered in the lamp-light as he stepped forward.\n\"General Grierson?\" he inquired, looking from one face to another.\n\n\"I am General Grierson.\"\n\n\"I'm Lieutenant Herbert Sherman of the U. S. Army Air Service. I have\njust escaped from the Lassans and came to offer you my services. I\nimagine your technical men might wish to know how they operate their\nmachines and what would be effective against them, and I think I can\ntell you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nCapture\n\n\nHerbert Sherman had wakened with a vague sense of something wrong and\nlay back in his seat for a moment, trying to remember. Everything seemed\ngoing quietly, the machine running with subdued efficiency.... It came\nto him with a jerk--he could not hear the motor. With that subconscious\nconcentration of the flying man on his ship, he glanced at the\ninstrument board first, and taking in the astonishing information that\nboth the altimeter and the air-speed meter registered zero, he looked\nover the side. His vision met the familiar dentilated line of the\nbuildings surrounding the Jackson Heights airport, with a tree plastered\ngreenly against one of them. Queer.\n\nHis sense of memory began to return. There was the night-mail flight\nfrom Cleveland; the spot of light ahead that grew larger and larger like\nthe most enormous of shooting stars, the sensation of sleepiness.... He\nremembered setting the controls to ride out the short remainder of the\njourney with the automatic pilot on the Jackson Heights' radio beam,\nsince he was clearly not going to make Montauk. But what came after\nthat?\n\nThen another oddity struck his attention. He recalled very clearly that\nhe had been flying over the white landscape of winter--but now there was\na tree in full leaf. Something was wrong. He clambered hastily from the\ncockpit.\n\nAs he swung himself over the side, his eye caught the glint of an\nunfamiliar high-light on the back of his hand and with the same\nstupefaction that Murray Lee was contemplating the same phenomenon\nseveral miles away, he perceived that instead of a flesh-and-blood\nmember he had somehow acquired an iron hand. The other one was the\nsame--and the arm--and the section of stomach which presently appeared\nwhen he tore loose his shirt to look at it.\n\nThe various possibilities that might account for it raced through his\nmind, each foundering on some fundamental difficulty. Practical\njoke--imagination--insanity--what else? Obviously some time had elapsed.\nBut how about the ground staff of the airport? He shouted. No answer.\n\nMuttering a few swears to himself he trudged across the flying field,\nnoting that it was grown up with daisies and far from newly rolled, to\nthe hangars. He shouted again. No answer. No one visible. He pounded at\nthe door, then tried it. It was unlocked. Inside someone sat tilted back\nin a chair against the wall, a cap pulled over his face. Sherman walked\nover to the sleeper, favoring him with a vigorous shake and the word,\n\"Hey!\"\n\nTo his surprise the stranger tilted sharply over to one side and went to\nthe floor with a bang, remaining in the position he had assumed.\nSherman, the thought of murder jumping in his head, bent over, tugging\nat the cap. The man was as metallic as himself, but of a different\nkind--a solid statue cast in what seemed to be bronze.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake!\" said Herbert Sherman to himself and the world at\nlarge.\n\nThere seemed to be nothing in particular he could do about it; the man,\nif he had ever been a man, and was not part of some elaborate scheme of\nflummery fixed up for his benefit, was beyond human aid. However there\nwas one way in which all difficulties could be solved. The sun was high\nand the town lay outside the door.\n\n... He spent a good deal of the day wandering about Jackson Heights,\ncontemplating such specimens of humanity as remained in the streets,\nfixed in the various ungraceful and unattractive attitudes of life. He\nhad always been a solitary and philosophical soul, and he felt neither\nloneliness nor overwhelming curiosity as to the nature of the\ncatastrophe which had stopped the wheels of civilization. He preferred\nto meditate on the vanity of human affairs and to enjoy a sense of\ntriumph over the ordinary run of bustling mortals who had always\nsomewhat irritated him.\n\nIn justice to Herbert Sherman it should be remarked that he felt no\ntrepidation as to the outcome of this celestial joke on the inhabitants\nof the world. Beside being an aviator he was a competent mechanic, and\nhe proved the ease with which he could control his new physique by\nsitting down in a restaurant next to the bronze model of a sleepy cat,\nremoving one shoe and sock and proceeding to take out and then replace\nthe cunningly concealed finger-nut which held his ankle in position,\nmarvelling at how any chemical or other change could have produced a\nthreaded bolt as an integral part of the human anatomy.\n\nToward evening, he returned to the flying field and examined his\nmachine. One wing showed the effect of weathering, but it was an\nall-metal Roamer of the latest model and it had withstood the ordeal\nwell. The gasoline gauge showed an empty tank, but it was no great task\nto get more from the big underground tanks at the field. Oil lines and\nradiators seemed all tight and when he swung the propeller, the motor\npurred for him like a cat.\n\nWith a kind of secret satisfaction gurgling within him Herbert Sherman\ntaxied across the field, put the machine into a climb, and went forth to\nhave a look at New York.\n\nHe thought he could see smoke over central Manhattan and swung the\nRoamer in that direction. The disturbance seemed to be located at the\nold Metropolitan Opera House which, as he approached it, seemed to have\nbeen burning, but had now sunk to a pile of glowing embers. The fire\nargued human presence of some kind. He took more height and looked down.\nTimes Square held a good many diminutive dots, but they didn't seem to\nbe moving.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe swung over to examine the downtown section. All quiet. When he\nreturned he saw a car dodging across Forty-Second Street and realizing\nthat he could find human companionship whenever he needed it, which he\ndid not at present, he returned to the flying field.\n\nAt this point It occurred to him to be hungry. Reasoning the matter out\nin the light of his mechanical experience, he drank a pint or more of\nlubricating oil and searched for a place to spend the night. Not being\nsleepy he raided a drug store where books were sold, for as much of its\nstock as he could use, and arranging one of the flares at the field in a\nposition convenient for reading, he settled down for the night. In the\ncourse of it he twice tried smoking and found that his new make-up had\nruined his taste for tobacco.\n\nWith the first streaks of day he was afoot again, going over the Roamer\nwith a fine-toothed comb, since he had no mechanic to do it for him,\ntuning her up for a long flight. He had no definite purpose in mind\nbeyond a look round the country. Was it all like this, or only New York?\n\nNewark attracted his attention first. He noted there were ships at most\nof the piers in the river and that none of them bore signs of life.\nNeither had the streets on the Jersey side of the river any occupants\nother than those who were obviously still forever.\n\nAs he flew along toward the Newark airport, a shadow fell athwart the\nwing and he looked up.\n\nA big bird was soaring past, flying above and fully as fast as the\nplane. In his quick glance Sherman caught something unfamiliar about its\nflight, and leaned over to snap on the mechanical pilot while he had\nanother look. The bird, if bird it was, was certainly a queer specimen;\nit seemed to have two sets of wings and was using them as though it were\nan airplane, with the fore pair outstretched and rigid, the hind wings\nvibrating rapidly. As he gazed at the bird it drew ahead of the plane,\ngave a few quick flips to its fore-wings and banked around to pick him\nup again.\n\nIt was coming closer and regarding him with an uncommonly intelligent\nand by no means friendly eye. Sherman swung his arm at it and gave a\nshout--to which the bird paid not the slightest attention. Newark was\nrunning away under him. Reluctantly, he resumed control of the stick,\nput the plane into a glide and made for the airport. It occurred to him\nthat this would be an awkward customer if it chose to attack him and he\nmeditated on the possibility of finding a gun in Newark.\n\nThe field was bumpy, but he taxied to a stop and climbed out to look\nover the silent hangars before one of which a little sports plane stood\ndejectedly, with a piece of torn wing flapping in the breeze. As the\nRoamer came to rest he looked back at the bird. It was soaring away up\nin a close spiral, emitting a series of screams. Sherman determined to\nfind a gun without delay.\n\nNewark was like Jackson Heights; same stony immobility of inhabitants,\nsame sense of life stopped at full tide in the streets. He prowled\naround till he found a hardware store and possessed himself of a fine\n.50-.50 express rifle with an adequate supply of cartridges as well as a\nrevolver, added to it a collection of small tools, and stopped in at a\nlibrary to get a supply of reading matter more to his taste than the\ndrug store could provide.\n\nAs he took off again two specks in the sky far to the north represented,\nhe decided, additional specimens of the peculiar bird life that had\nspread abroad since the change. How long it could have been, he had no\nidea.\n\nHe decided on a flight northwest, following the line of the mail route.\nThere was a chance that the whole country might not be engulfed by this\nmetal plague, though the absence of life in New York was not\nencouraging.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPort Jervis was his first control point, but Sherman was fond enough of\nthe green wooded slopes of the Catskills to run a little north of his\ncourse, bumpy though the air was over the mountains. He set the\nautomatic pilot and leaned back in his seat to enjoy the view.\n\nJust north of Central Valley something seemed different about the\nhillside; a new scar had appeared along its edge. He turned to examine\nit, swooping as he did so and in a quick glance from the fast-moving\nairplane saw that the great forest trees, maples and oaks, were all\ndown, twisted, barren and leafless, along a line that ran right up the\nvalley and across the hill, as though they had been harrowed by some\ngigantic storm. The line was singularly definite; there were no\nhalf-broken trees.\n\nHe swooped for another look, and at that moment was conscious of the\nbeat of swift wings and above the roar of the motor heard the scream of\none of those strange four-winged birds. Half-unconsciously, he put the\nRoamer into a steep climb and kicked the rudder to one side, just as the\nbird flew past him on whistling pinions, like an eagle that has missed\nits plunge, and recovered to rise again in pursuit. Sherman flattened\nout, and without paying any attention to direction, snapped in the\nautomatic pilot and reached for his gun.\n\nAs he bent there came a sharp crack from above and behind him and\nanother scream right overhead. He looked over his shoulder to see a\nsecond bird clutching at the edge of the cockpit with one giant claw,\nits forewings fluttering rapidly in the effort to keep its balance in\nthe propeller's slipstream. With the other claw it grabbed and grabbed\nfor him.\n\nSherman flattened himself against the bottom of the cockpit and fired up\nand back, once--twice--three times. The plane rocked; the bird let go\nwith a shrill scream, a spurt of blood showing on its chest feathers,\nand as Sherman straightened up he saw it whirling down, the wings\nbeating wildly, uselessly, the red spot spreading. But he had no time\nfor more than a glance. The other bird was whirling up to the attack\nbeneath him, yelling in quick jerks of sound as though it were shouting\na battle-cry.\n\nThe pistol, half-empty, might too easily miss. Sherman sought the rifle,\nand at that moment felt the impact of a swift blow on the floor of the\nplane. The bird understood that he had weapons and was attacking him\nfrom beneath to avoid them! The thought that it was intelligent flashed\nthrough his mind with a shock of surprise as he leaned over the side,\ntrying to get a shot at his enemy. Beneath the plane he caught a\nmomentary glimpse of the ground again, torn and tortured, and in the\ncenter of the devastation the ruins of a farmhouse, its roof canting\ncrazily over a pulled-out wall.\n\nThe bird dodged back and forth, picking now and then at the bottom of\nthe plane with its armored beak. He leaned further trying to get in a\nshot, and drew a chorus of yells from the bird, but no more definite\nresult. Bang! Again. Miss. Out of the tail of his eye he saw the line of\ngreen leap into being again. Flap, flap went the wings beneath him.\n\nSuddenly from below and behind him there rose a deep humming roar, low\npitched and musical. Abruptly the screaming of the bird ceased; it\ndropped suddenly away, its forewings folded, the rear wings spread,\nglider-like as it floated to the ground. He turned to look in the\ndirection of the sound, and as he turned a great glare of light sprang\nforth from somewhere back there, striking him full in the eyes with\nblinding force. At the same moment something pushed the Roamer forward\nand down, down, down. He could feel the plane give beneath him, but in\nthe blind haze of light his fumbling fingers could not find the stick,\nand as he fell a wave of burning heat struck his back and the sound of a\nmighty torrent reached his ears. There was a crash and everything went\nout in a confusion of light, heat and sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he recovered consciousness the first thing he saw was a blue dome,\nstretched so far above his head that it might have been the sky save for\nthe fact that the light it gave had neither glare nor shadow. He puzzled\nidly over this for a moment, then tried to turn his head. It would not\nmove. \"That's queer,\" thought Herbert Sherman, and attempted to lift an\narm. The hands responded readily enough but the arms were immovable.\nWith an effort he tried to lift his body and discovered that he was\ntightly held by some force he could not feel.\n\nHerbert Sherman was a patient man but not a meek one. He opened his\nmouth and yelled--a good loud yell with a hard swearword at the end of\nit. Then he stood still for a moment, listening. There was a sound that\nmight be interpreted as the patter of feet somewhere, but no one came\nnear him, so he yelled again, louder if possible.\n\nThis time the result accrued with a rapidity that was almost startling.\nA vivid bluish light struck him in the face, making him blink, then was\nturned off, and he heard a clash of gears and a hum that might be that\nof a motor. A moment later he felt himself lifted, whirled round,\ndropped with a plunk, and the blue dome overhead began to flow past at\nrapidly mounting speed to be blotted out in a grey dimness. He perceived\nhe was being carried down some kind of a passage whose ceiling consisted\nof dark stone. A motor whirred rapidly.\n\nThe stone ceiling vanished; another blue dome, less lofty, took its\nplace. The object on which he was being carried stopped with a\nmechanical click and he was lifted, whirled round again and deposited on\nsome surface. Out of the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of\nsomething round, of a shining black coloring, with pinkish highlights,\nlike the head of some enormous beast, and wiggled his fingers in angry\nand futile effort.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was flopped over on his face and found himself looking straight down\nat a grey mass which from its feel on nose and chin, appeared to be\nrubber.\n\nHe yelled again, with rage and vexation and in reply received a tap over\nthe head with what felt like a rubber hose. He felt extraordinarily\nhelpless. And as the realization came that he was helpless, without any\ncontrol of what was going on he relaxed. After all, there was no use....\nSome kind of examination was in progress. There was the sound of\nsoft-treading feet behind him.\n\nAfter a slight pause he was bathed in a red light of such intensity as\nto press upon him with physical solidity. He closed his eyes against it,\nand as he did so, felt a terrible pain in the region of his spine. Was\nit death? He gripped metallic teeth together firmly in an effort to\nfight the pain without yelling (perhaps this was deliberate torture and\nhe would not give them the satisfaction) and dully, amid the throbbing\npain, Sherman heard a clatter of metal instruments. Then the pain\nceased, the light went off and something was clamped about his head.\n\nA minute more and he had been flipped over on his back, and with the\nsame whirring of motors that had attended his arrival, was carried back\nthrough the passage and into the hall of the blue dome. He was still\nheld firmly; but now there was a difference. He could wiggle in his\nbonds.\n\nWith a clicking of machinery, he was tilted up on the plane that held\nhim. A hole yawned before his feet and he slid rapidly down a smooth\nincline, through a belt of dark, to drop in a heap on something soft.\nThe trapdoor clicked behind him.\n\nHe found himself, unbound, on a floor of rubber-like texture and on\nrising to look around, perceived that he was in a cell with no visible\nexit, whose walls were formed by a heavy criss-crossed grating of some\nred metal. It was a little more than ten feet square; in the center a\nseat with curving outlines rose from the floor, apparently made of the\nsame rubbery material as the floor itself. A metallic track ended just\nin front of the seat; following back, his eye caught the outline of a\nkind of lectern, now pushed back against the wall of the cell, with\nspaces below the reading flat and handles attached. Against the back\nwall of the cell stood a similar device, but larger and without any\nmetal track. Beside it two handles dangled from the wall on cords of\nflexible wire.\n\nThis was all his brief glance told him about the confines of his new\nhome. Looking beyond it, he saw that he was in one of a row of similar\ncells, stretching back in both directions. In front of the row of cells\nwas a corridor along which ran a brightly-burnished metal track, and\nthis was lined by another row of cells on the farther side.\n\nThe cell at Sherman's right was empty, but he observed that the one on\nthe left had a tenant--a metal man, like himself in all respects and\nyet--somehow unlike. He stepped over to the grating that separated them.\n\n\"What is this place, anyway?\" he inquired.\n\nHis neighbor, who had been sitting in the rubber chair, turned toward\nhim a round and foolish face with a long, naked upper lip, and burst\ninto a flood of conversation of which Sherman could not understand one\nword. He held up his hand. \"Wait a minute, partner,\" he said. \"Go slow.\nI don't get you.\"\n\nThe expression on the fellow's face changed to one of wonderment. He\nmade another effort at conversation, accompanying it with gestures.\n\"Wait,\" said the aviator, \"_Sprechen Sie Deutsch?... Francais?... Habla\nEspanol?..._ No? Dammit what does the guy talk? I don't know any\nItalian--Spaghetti, macaroni, Mussolini!\"\n\nNo use. The metal face remained blankly uninspired. Well, there is one\nthing men of all races have in common. Sherman went through the motions\nof drawing from his pocket a phantom cigarette, applying to it an\nimaginary match, and blowing the smoke in the air.\n\nIt is impossible for a man whose forehead is composed of a series of\nlateral metal bands to frown. If it were the other would have done so.\nThen comprehension appeared to dawn on him. He stepped across to his\nlectern, and _with his toes_, pulled the bottom slide open, extracted\nfrom it a round rubber container and reaching through the bars, handed\nit to Sherman.\n\nThe aviator understood the difference that had puzzled him in the\nbeginning. Instead of the graceful back-sweeping curve that sets a man's\nhead vertical with his body, this individual had the round-curved neck\nand low-hung head of the ape.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Poisoned Paradise\n\n\nTo hide his surprise Sherman bent his head to examine the object the\nape-man had handed him. It was about the size of a baseball with little\nholes in it. He inserted a finger in one of the holes, and a stream of\noil squirted out and struck him in the eye. His neighbor gave a cry of\nannoyance at his clumsiness and reached through the bars to have the\nball returned. As he received it there came sudden flickerings of lights\nalong the hall from somewhere high up, like the trails of blue and green\nrockets. The mechanical ape-man dropped the oil-ball and dashed to the\nfront of his cell.\n\nSherman saw a vehicle proceeding down the line of cells; a kind of truck\nthat rode on the track of the corridor and was so wide it just missed\nthe gratings. It had a long series of doors in its sides, and as it came\nopposite an occupied cell, stopped. Something invisible happened; the\nbars of the cell opened inward and the inmate emerged to step into a\ncompartment which at once closed behind him.\n\nWhen it stopped at the ape-man's cage Sherman watched the procedure\nclosely. A little arm appeared from beneath the door of the compartment\nand did something to one of the lower bars of the cell. But the truck\npassed Sherman by, moving silently along to other cells beyond him.\n\nHe turned to examine the room more closely, and as he did so, saw that a\nsecond truck was following the first. This one, with an exactly reversed\nprocedure, was returning robots to their cells. This second truck\ndropped an inmate in the cell at his right (another ape-man) and\ntrundled along down the line, but as it reached the end of the corridor,\nturned back and running along till it came to his cell, stopped, flung\nout the metal arm, and opened the bars in invitation.\n\nSherman had no thought of disobeying; as long as he was in this queerest\nof all possible worlds, he thought, one might as well keep to the rules.\nBut he was curious about the joint of the cage and how it unlocked and\nhe paused a moment to examine it. The machine before him buzzed\nimpatiently. He lingered. There came a sudden clang of metal from inside\nthe car, a vivid beam of blue light called his attention, and looking\nup, he saw the word \"EXIT\" printed in letters of fire at the top of the\ncompartment.\n\nWith a smile he stepped in. A soft light was turned on and he found\nhimself in a tiny cubbyhole with just room for the single seat it\nprovided and on which he seated himself. There was no window.\n\nThe machine carried him along smoothly for perhaps five minutes, stopped\nand the door opened before him. He issued into another blue-domed hall.\nA small one this time, containing a rubber seat like that in his cell,\nbut with an extended arm on which rested a complex apparatus of some\nkind. The seat faced a white screen like those in movie theaters.\n\nHe seated himself and at once a series of words appeared in dark green\non the screen. \"Dominance was not complete,\" it said. \"Communication?\"\nThen below, in smaller type, as though it were the body of a newspaper\ncolumn. \"Lassans service man. Flier writing information through\ncommunication excellent. Dinner bed, book. No smoking. Yours very\ntruly.\"\n\nAs he gazed in astonishment at this cryptic collection of words it was\nerased and its place was taken by a picture which he recognized as a\nlikeness of himself in his present metallic state. A talking picture,\nwhich made a few remarks in the same incomprehensible gibberish the\nape-man had used, then sat down in a chair like that in which he now\nrested, and proceeded to write on the widespread arm with a stylus which\nwas attached to it. The screen went blank.... Evidently he was supposed\nto communicate something by writing.\n\nThe stylus was a metal pencil, and the material of the arm, though not\napparently metallic, must be, he argued from the fact that it seemed to\nhave electric connections attached. As he examined it, the blue lights\nflickered at him impatiently. \"The white knight,\" he wrote in a fit of\nimpish perversity, \"is climbing up the poker.\" Instantly the words\nflashed on the screen.\n\nPause. \"IS CLIMBING\" declared the screen, in capitals; then below it\nappeared a fairly creditable picture of a knight in armor followed by a\nnot very creditable picture of a poker. Sherman began to comprehend.\nWhoever it was behind this business had managed a correspondence course\nof a sort in English, but had failed to learn the verbs and he was\nbeing asked to explain.\n\nFor answer he produced a crude drawing of a monkey climbing a stick and\ndemonstrated the action by getting up and going through the motions of\nclimbing. Immediately the screen flashed a picture of the knight in\narmor ascending the poker by the same means, but it had hardly appeared\nbefore it was wiped out to be replaced by a flickering of blue lights\nand an angry buzz. His interlocutor had seen the absurdity of the\nsentence and was demanding a more serious approach to the problem. For\nanswer Sherman wrote, \"Where am I and who are you?\"\n\nA longer pause. \"Dominance not complete,\" said the screen. Then came the\npicture of the first page of a child's ABC book with \"A was an Archer\nwho shot at a frog\" below the usual childish picture. Then came the word\n\"think.\" With the best will in the world Sherman was puzzled to\nillustrate this idea, but by tapping his forehead and drawing a crude\ndiagram of the brain as he remembered it from books, he managed to give\nsome satisfaction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe process went on for three or four hours as nearly as Sherman could\njudge the time, ending with a flash of the word \"Exit\" in red from the\nscreen and a dimming of the blue-dome light. He turned toward the door\nand found the car that had brought him, ready for the return journey. As\nit rumbled back to his cell he ruminated on the fact that none of the\nmen (or whatever it was) behind this place had yet made themselves\nvisible, for it was incredible that beings of the type of the metallic\nape-man who occupied the next cell to his should have intelligence\nenough to operate such obviously highly-developed machinery.\n\nBut what next? He pondered the question as the car deposited him in his\ncell. Obviously, he was being kept a prisoner. He didn't like it,\nhowever comfortable the imprisonment.\n\nThe first thing that suggested itself was a closer inspection of his\ncell. The lectern yielded an oil-ball like that the ape-man had given\nhim and another, similar device, containing grease. There were various\ntools of uncertain purpose and in the last drawer he examined a complete\nduplicate set of wrist and finger joints. The larger cupboard had deep\ndrawers, mostly empty, though one of them contained a number of books,\napparently selected at random from a good-sized sized library--\"Mystery\nof Oldmixon Hall,\" \"Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1903,\" \"The\nPoems of Jerusha G. White\"--a depressing collection.\n\nThis seemed to exhaust the possibilities of the cell and Sherman looked\nabout for further amusement. His ape neighbor had pressed himself close\nto the bars on that side, indicating his interest in what Sherman was\ndoing by chuckling bubbles of amusement. Further down the line one of\nthe ape-men was holding the pair of handles that projected from the wall\nbeside his cabinet. Sherman grasped his also; there was a pleasant\nlittle electric shock and in the center of the wall before him a slide\nmoved back to disclose a circle of melting light that changed color and\nform in pleasing variations. The sensation was enormously invigorating\nand it struck the aviator with surprise that this must be the way these\ncreatures.... \"These creatures!\" he thought, \"I'm one of them....\" the\nway these creatures acquired nourishment. The thought gave him an\ninspiration.\n\n\"Hey!\" he called in a voice loud enough to carry throughout the room.\n\"Is there anyone here that can understand what I'm saying?\"\n\nThere was a clank of metal as faces turned in his direction all down the\nline of cages. \"Yes, I guess so,\" called a voice from about thirty feet\naway. \"What do you want to say?\"\n\nSherman felt an overwhelming sense of relief. He would not have believed\nit possible to be so delighted with a human voice. \"Who's got us here\nand why are they keeping us here?\" he shouted back.\n\nA moment's silence. Then--\"Near's I can make out it's a passel of\nelephants and they've got us here to work.\"\n\n\"What?\" Sherman shouted back, not sure he had heard aright.\n\n\"Work!\" came the answer. \"Make you punch the holes on these goddam light\nmachines. It wears your fingers off and you have to screw new ones in at\nnight.\"\n\n\"No, I mean about the elephants.\"\n\n\"That's what I said--elephants. They wear pants, and they're right\nsmart, too.\"\n\nInsoluble mystery. \"Who are you?\" called the aviator.\n\n\"Mellen. Harve Mellen. I had a farm right here where they set up this\nopry house of theirs.\"\n\nAlong the edge of Sherman's cell a blue light began to blink. He had an\nuncomfortable sensation of being watched. \"Is there any way of getting\nout of here?\" he shouted to his unseen auditor.\n\n\"Sssh,\" answered the other. \"Them blue lights mean they want you to shut\nup. You'll get a paste in the eye with the yaller lights if you don't.\"\n\nSo that was it! They were being held as the servants--slaves--of some\nunseen and powerful and very watchful intelligence. As for \"elephants\nwith pants\" they might resemble that and they might not; it was entirely\npossible that the phrase represented merely a picturesque bit of\nmetaphor on the part of the farmer.\n\nWhy it must be an actual invasion of the earth, as in H. G. Wells' \"War\nof the Worlds,\" a book he had read in his youth. The comet could have\nbeen no comet then, and.... Yet the whole thing--this transformation of\nhimself into a metal machine, the crash of the Roamer and his subsequent\nbath in the painful red light. It was all too fantastic--then he\nremembered that one does not feel pain in dreams....\n\nThey were giving him books, food--if this electrical thing was indeed\nthe food his new body required--little to do; keeping him a prisoner in\na kind of poisoned paradise.\n\n... At all events the locks on these bars should offer no great\ndifficulty to a competent mechanic. He set himself to a further\nexamination of the tools in the lectern.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe main difficulty in the way of any plan of escape lay in his complete\nlack of both information and the means of obtaining it. The mechanical\nape-men were hopeless; they merely babbled incoherent syllables and\nseemed incapable of fixing their attention on any object for as long as\nfive minutes. As for the New York farmer his cage was so far away that\nthe conversation could be carried on only in shouts, and every shout\nbrought a warning flicker of the blue lights. On the second day, out of\ncuriosity, Sherman kept up the conversation after the blue lights went\non. A vivid stream of yellow light promptly issued from one corner of\nthe cage, striking him fully in the eyes, and apparently it was\naccompanied by some kind of a force-ray for he found himself stretched\nflat on the floor. After that he did not repeat the experiment.\n\nThe next question was that of the lock on the cell-bars. The closest\ninspection he could give did not reveal the joints; they were\nextraordinarily well fitted. On the other hand, he remembered that the\narm of the truck had reached under one of the lower bars. Lying flat on\nhis back, Sherman pulled himself along from bar to bar, inspecting each\nin turn. About mid-way along the front of the cell, he perceived a tiny\norifice in the base of one bar--a mere pin-hole. Marvelling at the\ndelicacy of the adjustment which could use so tiny a hole as a lock he\nsat down to consider the question.\n\nHe was completely naked and had nothing but the objects that had been\nplaced in his cell by his jailers. However--\n\nAmong the assortment of tools in his bureau was a curve-bladed knife\nwith the handle set parallel to the blade as though it were meant for\nchopping, and forming the wall of the same drawer was a strip of a\nmaterial like emery cloth. After some experimenting he found a\nfinger-hole which, when squeezed, caused this emery-cloth to revolve,\ngiving a satisfactory abrasive.\n\nThus armed with a tool and a means of keeping an edge on it, he took one\nof the metal bands from the drawer that contained the duplicate set of\nhands and set to work on it....\n\nProducing a needle that would penetrate the hole in the bars was all of\nthree days' work, though he had no means of marking the time accurately.\nThe metal band was pliable, light, and for all its pliability and\nlightness, incredibly hard. His tool would barely scratch it and\nrequired constant sharpenings. Moreover, he had little time to himself;\nhis unseen scholar required constant lessons in English. But at last the\ntask was done. Choosing a moment when one of the cages at his side was\nempty and the occupant of the other was busy over some silly sport of\nhis own--tossing a ball from one hand to another--Sherman lay down on\nthe floor, found the opening and drove his needle home. Nothing\nhappened.\n\nHe surveyed the result with disappointment. It was disheartening, after\nso much labor to attain no result at all. But it occurred to him that\nperhaps he had not learned the whole secret of the arm, and the next\ntime the car came down the corridor for him, he was lying on the floor,\ncarefully watching the opening.\n\nAs he had originally surmised, a needle-like point was driven home. But\nhe noted that on either side of the point the arm gripped the bar\ntightly, pressing it upward.\n\nThis presented another difficulty. He had only two hands; if one of them\nworked the needle he could grip the bar in only one place. But he\nremembered, fortunately, that his toes had showed a remarkable power of\nprehension since the change that had made him into a machine.\n\nHe finally succeeded in bracing himself in a curiously twisted attitude\nand driving the needle home under the proper auspices. To his delight\nit worked--when the needle went in the bars opened in the proper place,\nswinging back into position automatically as the pressure was withdrawn.\n\nWith a new sense of freedom Sherman turned to the next step. This was\nobviously to find out more of the place in which he was confined and of\nthe possibilities of escape. It seemed difficult.\n\nBut even on this point he was not to be long without enlightenment. His\nunseen pupil in English was making most amazing progress. The white\nscreen which was their means of communication now bore complicated\nmessages about such subjects as what constituted philosophy. Sherman\nfelt himself in contact with an exceptionally keen and active mind,\nthough one to which the simplest earthly ideas were unfamiliar. There\nwere queer misapprehensions--for instance, no process of explanation he\ncould give seemed to make the unseen scholar understand the use and\nvalue of money, and they labored for a whole day over the words\n\"president\" and \"political.\"\n\nIn technical matters it was otherwise; Sherman had barely to express the\nidea before the screen made it evident that the auditor had grasped its\nwhole purport. When he wrote the word \"atom\" for instance, and tried to\ngive a faint picture of the current theory of the atom, it was hardly a\nsecond before the screen flashed up with a series of diagrams and\nmathematical formulae, picturing and explaining atoms of different\ntypes.\n\nAfter four weeks or more (as nearly as Sherman could estimate it in that\nnightless, sleepless place where time was an expression rather than a\nreality) the car that came for him one day discharged him into a room\nentirely different from the school-room. Like the school-room it was\nsmall, and some twenty feet across. Against the wall opposite the door\nstood a huge machine, the connections of which seemed to go back through\nthe wall. Its vast complex of pulleys, valves and rods, conveyed no hint\nof its purpose, even to his mechanically-trained mind.\n\nAcross the front of it was a long, black board, four feet or more across\nand somewhat like the instrument board of an airplane in general\ncharacter. At the top of this board was a band of ground glass, set off\nin divisions. Beneath this band a series of holes, each just large\nenough to admit a finger, and each marked off by a character of some\nkind though in no language Sherman had ever seen.\n\nTo complete the picture, one of the mechanical ape-men stood before the\nboard as though expecting him. On the ape-man's head was a tight-fitting\nhelmet, connecting with some part of the machine by a flexible tube. As\nSherman entered the room the ape-man motioned him over to the board,\npointed to the holes and in thick, but intelligible English, said\n\"Watsch!\" A flash of purple light appeared behind the first of the\nground-glass screens. The ape-man promptly thrust his finger into the\nfirst of the holes. The light went out, and the ape-man turned to\nSherman. \"Do,\" he said. The light flashed on again, and Sherman, not\nunwilling to learn the purpose of the maneuver, did as his instructor\nhad done.\n\nHe was rewarded by a tearing pain in the finger-tip and withdrew the\nmember at once. Right at the end it had become slightly grey. The\nape-man smiled. Behind the second ground-glass a red light now appeared\nand the ape-man thrust his finger into another of the apertures,\nindicating that Sherman should imitate him. This time the aviator was\nmore cautious, but as he delayed the light winked angrily. Again he\nreceived the jerk of pain in the finger-tip and withdrew it to find\nthat the grey spot had spread.\n\n[Illustration: He was rewarded by a tearing pain in his fingertip.\nBehind the ground glass a red light now appeared.]\n\nWhen the third light flashed on he refused to copy the motion of his\ninstructor. The light blinked at him insistently. He placed both hands\nbehind his back and stepped away from the machine. The ape-man, looking\nat him with something like panic, beckoned him forward again. Sherman\nshook his head; the ape-man threw back his head and emitted a long,\npiercing howl. Almost immediately the door slid back and the car\nappeared. As Sherman stepped to its threshold, instead of admitting him,\nit thrust forth a gigantic folding claw which gripped him firmly around\nthe waist and held him while a shaft of the painful yellow light was\nthrown into his eyes; then tossed him back on the floor and slammed shut\nvengefully.\n\nDazed by the light and the fall, Herbert Sherman rolled on the floor,\nthoughts of retaliation flashing through his head. But he was no fool,\nand before he had even picked himself up, he realized that his present\ncast was hopeless. Gritting his teeth, he set himself to follow the\nape-man's instructions, looking him over carefully to recognize him\nagain in case--.\n\nThe course of instruction was not particularly difficult to memorize. It\nseemed that for each color of light behind the ground-glass panels one\nmust thrust a finger into a different one of the holes below; hold it\nthere in spite of the pain, till the colored light went out, and then\nremove it. The process was very hard on the fingers, made of metal\nthough they were. What was it the farmer had shouted down the hall?\n\"Wears your fingers out?\" Well, it did that, all right. After an hour or\ntwo of it, when he had learned to perform the various operations with\nmechanical precision and the tip of his index finger had already begun\nto scale off, the ape-man smiled at him, waved approval and reaching\ndown beneath the black board, pulled out a drawer from which he\nextracted a finger-tip, made in the same metal as those he already bore,\nand proceeded to show Sherman how to attach it.\n\nAs a mechanic, he watched the process with some interest. The \"bone\" of\nthe finger, with its joint, screwed cunningly into the bone of the next\njoint below, the lower end of the screw being curiously cut away and\nhaving a tiny point of wire set in it. The muscular bands had loose ends\nthat merely tucked in, but so well were they fashioned, that once in\nposition, it was impossible to pull them out until the finger-tip had\nbeen unscrewed.\n\nThe instruction process over, he was returned to his cell, wondering\nwhat was to happen next. The poisoned paradise was becoming less of a\nparadise. He speculated on the possibility of wrecking the car that bore\nhim from place to place, but finally decided that it could not be done\nwithout some heavy tool and was hardly worth the trouble in any case\nuntil he was more certain of getting away afterward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe Lassan\n\n\nWhen the car next called for him, it took a much longer course; one\nsteadily downward and around a good many curves as he could judge from\nthe way in which it swayed and gained and lost speed. It was fully a\ntwenty-minute ride, and when he stepped out it was not into a room of\nany kind, but in what appeared to be a tunnel cut in the living rock, at\nleast six feet wide and fully twice as high. The rock on all sides had\nbeen beautifully smoothed by some unknown hand, except underfoot where\nit had been left rough enough to give a grip to the feet.\n\nAt his side were two of the ape-men who had been released from the car\nat the same time. The tunnel led them straight ahead for a distance,\nthen dipped and turned to the right. As he rounded the corner he could\nsee that it ended below and before him in some room where machinery\nwhirred. The ape-men went straight on, looking neither to the right nor\nthe left. As they reached the door that gave into the machine-room they\nencountered another ape-man wearing the same kind of helmet with its\nattached tube, as Sherman's instructor had worn. The ape-men who came\nwith him stopped. The helmeted one looked at them stupidly for a moment\nand then, as though obeying some unspoken command, took one by the arm\nand led him across the room to the front of a machine and there thrust\none of the ubiquitous helmets on his head.\n\nThe machine, as nearly as Sherman could make out, was a duplicate of\nthat on which he had injured his fingers; as the helmet was buckled on\nthe ape-man who stood before it he immediately began to watch the\nground-glass panels and put his fingers in the holes below.\n\nThe process was repeated with the second ape-man, and then the sentinel\nreturned to Sherman. Taking him by the arm, the mechanical beast led him\npast the row of machines (there seemed to be only four in the room) and\nto a door at one side, giving him a gentle push. It was the opening of\nanother tunnel, down which Sherman walked for some forty or fifty yards\nbefore encountering a second door and a second helmeted ape-man sentry.\n\nThis one did exactly as the first had done. Stared at him for a moment,\nthen took him by the arm and led him across the room to a machine, where\nit left him. Sherman perceived that he was supposed to care for it, and\nwith a sigh, bent to his task.\n\nIt was some moments before the rapid flashing of lights gave him a\nrespite. Then he had an opportunity to look about him and observed that,\nas in the other room, there were four machines. Two of them were\nuntenanted, but at the one next to his, there was someone working. When\nhe glanced again, he was sure it was a mechanized human like\nhimself--and a girl!\n\n\"What is this place?\" he asked, \"and who are you?\"\n\nThe other gave a covert glance over his shoulder at the sentry by the\ndoor.\n\n\"Sssh!\" she said out of the corner of her mouth, \"not so loud.... I'm\nMarta Lami--and I think this place is hell!\"\n\nAfter a time they contrived a sort of conversation, a word at a time,\nwith covert glances at the ape-man sentry. He looked at them\nsuspiciously once or twice, but as he made no attempt to interfere they\ngained confidence.\n\n\"Who--is--keeping--us--here?\" asked Sherman.\n\n\"Don't--know,\" she replied in the same manner.\n\"Think--it's--the--elephants.\"\n\n\"What elephants?\" he asked a word at a time. \"I haven't seen any.\"\n\n\"You will. They come around and inspect what you're doing. Are you new\nhere?\"\n\n\"New at these machines. They had me teaching them to write English. This\nis my first day in here.\"\n\n\"This is my eightieth work-period. We lost track of the days.\"\n\n\"So did I. Where are we? Are there any other humans with you?\"\n\n\"One in the cage across the corridor from me. Walter Stevens the Wall\nStreet man.\"\n\n\"Have they got him on this job, too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSherman could not avoid a snicker. Back in the days before the comet he\nhad had Stevens as a passenger once, and a more difficult customer to\nsatisfy, a more cocksure-of-his-own-importance man he had never seen.\nThe thought of him burning his fingertips up in one of these machines\ngave him some amusement. But his next question was practical.\n\n\"Do you know what these machines are for?\"\n\n\"Haven't the least idea; Stevens said they were for digging something.\nThey had the helmets on him twice.\"\n\n\"What helmets?\"\n\n\"Like the dopey at the door wears. The dopeys all have to wear them.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Haven't got any brains, I guess. I had one on once when they were\nteaching me to do this. They tell you what to think.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You put the helmet on and it's like you're hypnotized. You can't think\nanything but what they want you to think.\"\n\nSherman shuddered slightly. So that was how the mechanical ape-men were\ncontrolled so perfectly!\n\n\"How did they get you?\" asked the girl who had described herself as\nMarta Lami.\n\n\"In an airplane. I'm an aviator. They shot me down somewhere and when I\ncame to, put me in one of those cages. How did you get here?\"\n\n\"The birds. I was at West Point with Stevens and that old fool\nVanderschoof. They started shooting at the birds and the birds just\npicked us up and flew away with us.\"\n\n\"Where were you after you came to? I mean after the comet.\"\n\n\"New York. Century Roof. I was dancing there before.\"\n\n\"You aren't Marta Lami, the dancer?\"\n\n\"Sure. Who the hell do you think?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned and regarded her deliberately, careless of the aroused\nattention of the sentry. So this was the famous dancer who had blazed\nacross two continents and three divorce suits--who had been proclaimed\nthe most beautiful woman in the world in starring electric lights before\nan applauding Broadway; for whose performances speculators held tickets\nat prize-fight premiums! How little she resembled it now, a parody of\nthe human form, working her fingers off as the slave of an alien and\nconquering race.\n\nShe asked the next question:\n\n\"Where have they got you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. In a cage somewhere. The only people around there are\nlike these mugs.\" He nodded toward the ape-man.\n\n\"I wonder how long they'll keep us at this.\"\n\n\"I wish I could tell you. How's chances of making a break?\"\n\n\"Rotten. There was a guy at the next machine tried it three or four\nwork-periods ago. He socked the dopey at the door.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"They sent a machine down for him and gave him the yellow lights all\nover. It was fierce, you should have heard him scream.\"\n\n\"How far down are we, anyway?\"\n\n\"You got me, boy friend. Sssh! Watch the dopey.\"\n\nSherman glanced over his shoulder to see the ape-man moving aside from\nthe door and bent back to his work. Evidently something important was\nimminent, judging from the actions of the sentry and the energetic\nattention the ex-dancer was giving to her machine. He was not deceived.\nDown the passage came something moving; something flesh-like and smooth,\nof a pale, grey-blue, dead-fish color, like a dangling serpent, then a\nround bulging head and finally the full form of an elephant!\n\nBut such an elephant as mortal eye had never before seen. For it stood\nbarely eight feet high and its legs were both longer and infinitely more\nslender and graceful than the legs of any earthly elephant. The ears\nwere smaller, not loose flaps of skin, but possessed of definite form\nand pressed close to the head. The skull was enormous, bulging at the\nforehead, and wrinkled in the middle down over the large intelligent\neyes in an expression permanently cross and dissatisfied. As for the\ntrunk it reached nearly to the floor, longer and thinner in proportion\nthan the trunk of an ordinary elephant, and at its tip divided into four\nfinger-like projections set around the circle of the nostril.\n\nOddest of all, the elephant wore clothes! Or at least an outer garment,\na kind of long cloak which appeared to be attached underneath its body\nand which covered every portion except the ankles. The feet also were\ncovered. A kind of hood hung back from the head on that portion of the\ncloak which rested on the creature's back. But what chiefly aroused\nSherman's sense of strangeness and loathing was that the naked skin,\nwherever exposed, was of that same poisonous, dead-fish blue.\n\nFor a moment the thing stood in the doorway, regarding them, swinging\nits long trunk around restlessly, as though it could tell something\nabout them by its sense of smell. Then it advanced a step or two into\nthe room, and placing its trunk close to Sherman's body, began to run\nover it, sniffing, a few inches away. He felt that he wanted to shriek,\nto turn and strike the thing, or to run, but a warning glance from the\ndancer kept him motionless.\n\nApparently satisfied with the result of its examination the elephant\nturned to go, stopping as it did so to unhook some projection on the\nape-man's helmet and apply it to its ear. After listening for a moment,\nit put the end of the trunk to this projection, snorted into it, and\nwent away with soundless steps.\n\nFor several minutes the two worked on in silence after this. Then:\n\n\"Well, now you seen him,\" said the dancer, in the same word-by-word\nfashion as before. \"That was our boss.\"\n\n\"That--thing?\" asked Sherman, incredulously.\n\n\"I'll tell the cockeyed world. Say, those babies know more than Einstein\never heard of. Try to get fresh with one of them and see.\"\n\n\"What do they do?\"\n\n\"Shoot you with one of the light-guns. They carry little ones around\nwith them. They melt you down wherever they hit you and you have to go\nto the operating room to have things put back and it hurts like hell.\"\n\n\"Oh, I must have been there after they brought me down in my plane. They\ndid something to my back.\"\n\n\"Then you know, boy friend. After that they put the helmet on you and\nyou have to tell 'em what you're thinking about. You can beat that game,\nthough, if you're careful. All I'd give 'em was how good a couple of\nScotch highballs would taste and it made monkeys of 'em.\"\n\nIt was all very strange and not a little bewildering. Intelligent\nelephants that controlled forces beyond the powers of men; who could\nplace a helmet on your head and read your thoughts; who could repair the\nnew mechanized human form after it had apparently suffered irreparable\ndamage, and who treated men and women as lower animals. Their arrival\nmust have been that of the comet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHerbert Sherman had read deeply enough, though not widely. He remembered\nsome Englishman--Colvin--Kevin--Kelvin, that was it!--who had a theory\nthat life had drifted to the earth from somewhere out in the void of\nspace and time. Had these, too, drifted in, in the same way the\nancestors of man had come, to set a period to the day of man's dominance\nover creation? A strange enough creation it was now, though, with its\nmechanical men and its animals turned to metal statues. He wondered what\nNoah would say, and giggled at the thought.\n\n\"What's the joke, boy friend?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing. I had an idea.\"\n\nTheir plight at the hands of these master-animals was bad, but it might\nbe worse. At least he had a certain amount of freedom, he was stronger\nthan he had ever before been in his life, and felt quite as intelligent.\nIt would be strange if he could not accomplish something.... He fell to\nplanning out ways of escaping and failed to notice the pain in his\nfingers in the intensity of his thoughts.\n\nEverything seemed to show that the operation of most of these machines\nwas predominantly electrical. It would be strange if the car that\ncarried them to and fro was not, yes and by Jove, the helmets the\nape-men wore. If he could short-circuit the works, or even a part of\nthem....\n\nApparently his new body was a good conductor and impervious to the\ninjurious effects of the electric current. Short-circuit something, that\nwas the idea, create a confusion--and trust to escaping in the midst of\nit? Perhaps--but at all events a good deal could be learned about these\nelephant-men and their methods by watching them in such an emergency.\nTheir machinery was so efficient that a child could operate it; it was\nin a pinch that their real intelligence would show.\n\nIt struck him that it would do little good to escape unless he did learn\nsomething about these elephant-people, their mysterious light-guns,\ntheir vast city that they seemed to have hollowed out of the heart of\nthe solid Catskill rock, their chemistry and metallurgy and methods of\nattack and defense. Otherwise escape would be a jumping from the\nfrying-pan into the fire. There would be nothing for it but a desperate,\nharried existence, the existence of one of the lower animals faced by\nthe insupportable competition of man.\n\nInformation! That was the first need. He must bend all his energies to\nthe task of obtaining it.\n\n\"By the way, what do these eggs call themselves?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lassans,\" said the dancer.\n\nA light flickered along the corridor. The ape-man at the door came\nforward, touched him on the arm and led him to the passage where he\ncaught the car back to his cage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIn the Passages\n\n\nThe first thing to be done, Sherman decided, was to short-circuit the\nmind-reading helmet of the guard at the door, if it were possible. He\nwas not certain that the thing was electrical, and ignorant of how the\ncurrent was conveyed if it were. He realized that he was dealing with\nthe products of an utterly alien form of mentality, one that might not\nproduce its results in the same way as an earth-man would at all. But\nsomething had to be dared, and this seemed to offer the best\nopportunity.\n\nIf the thing were electrical, the current must come through the tube to\nthe top of the head. On his second work-period he observed this tube\nwith care. It ran through an aperture in the stone roof and was\napparently provided with some spring device, for a considerable length\nof it reeled out when the ape-man wished to walk across the room, and\nwas absorbed as he returned.\n\nThe tube seemed to be made of the rubber-like material that composed the\nfloor of his cage. The simplest plan, of course, would be to bring his\nchopping-knife with him and when the ape-man paused before the wall,\nswing it up in a sweep, severing the tube. But this, he felt, was not to\nbe recommended. It would not necessarily short-circuit the current and\nthe damage would be too readily laid at his door. The desideratum was\nsome damage that apparently accidental, would yet produce a good deal of\nuproar.\n\nHe talked it over with Marta Lami.\n\n\"I think you're bugs,\" she said frankly, \"but anything for excitement.\nWhat do you want me to do about it?\"\n\n\"Well, here's what I figured out,\" Sherman explained. \"We both arrive\nabout the same time. I'll bring my knife. When we come in you hang back\na bit, and while you're doing it, I'll take a poke at that cable with\nthe knife, not enough to cut it, but enough to damage it. Then about\nhalf-way through the work period, I'll turn around and say something to\nyou. If I do it quick enough, I think the monk will start for me, and if\nthe cable doesn't go then, I'll miss my guess.\"\n\nThe next period proved unsuitable; the dancer's car arrived considerably\nbefore Sherman's and the plan was dropped for the time, but on the\nfollowing occasion, as Sherman came down the passage, he noticed Marta\nLami just ahead of him. He hurried to catch up and she evidently\nunderstood, for she avoided the guard's outstretched hand and hung back\na minute against the wall as Sherman came up behind. He made one quick\nmotion; the cable sheared half-way through exposing two wires of bright\nmetal.\n\nAs luck would have it, it proved unnecessary to put the second part of\nthe plan into operation. For just as Sherman was nerving himself to\nswing round and attract the ape-man's attention, he heard the soft\npad-pad of one of the approaching Lassans. The ape-man stepped back to\nclear the entrance as he had before, and as he did so, there was a\ntrickle of sparks, a blinding flash, and the cable short-circuited.\n\nThe result was totally unexpected. From the great machine before Sherman\nthere came an answering flash; the ground glass split across with a\nbang, there was a hissing sound and something blew up with a roar that\nrocked the underground chambers....\n\nSherman came to himself flat on his back and with pieces of rock and the\ndebris of the machine lying across his legs. He looked around; Marta\nLami lay some little distance across the room, half covered with fallen\nrock, one arm flung across her eyes as though to protect them. Above,\nthe solid granite looked as though a blasting charge had been fired in\nits midst. Sherman pulled himself to a sitting posture, and finding\nnothing damaged, stood upright. The machine, badly shattered, lay in\nfragments of bent rods, broken pulleys and wrecked cylinders all about\nhim. In the place where it had stood was a long narrow opening, down at\nthe end of which something irregular shut off a bright point of light. A\nblast of heat exuded from the place and a steady, deep-voiced roaring\nwas audible. The ape-man guard was nowhere to be seen.\n\nHe bent to pick up the unconscious girl, wondering how one revived a\nmechanical woman, especially without water, but she solved the problem\nfor him by opening her eyes and asking:\n\n\"Who touched off the pineapple, boy friend?\"\n\n\"I did. Come out of it and tell me what we do next. Anything busted?\"\n\n\"Only my head.\" She patted the mass of stiff wire. \"Boy, am I glad I\nwore my hair long before they made a robot of me!\" And with an effort\nshe stood up, looked down the pit where the machine had been and said,\n\"Say, let's get out of here. That don't look so good.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Sherman, \"which way? Wait till I get my knife.\"\n\n\"No, leave it,\" she said. \"Those babies are nobody's saps. If they find\nit on you they'll know you shot the well. Come on, I think that thing is\ngoing to pop again.\"\n\nThe roaring had increased in both volume and intensity, and the\nmachine-room had become unbearably hot. They turned toward the door, but\njust at the entrance into the passage a pile of debris had descended,\nmaking egress impossible. Behind them the roaring increased still more.\n\"Come on, boy friend,\" called the dancer, tearing at the rocks. \"Get\nthese out of the road unless you want to be stewed in your own juice.\"\n\nTogether they toiled over the blocks of granite, hurling them backward\ntoward the wreck of the machine. One minute, two, three--the roaring\nbehind them grew and spread, the heat became terrific.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Marta Lami at last. A tiny opening at the top of the heap\nwas before them. Sherman tugged at a rock--one more, and they would be\nthrough. But it was too big, would not budge.\n\n\"No, this one,\" shouted his companion and together they dragged at it.\nIt gave--a cascade of smaller stones rolled down the heap to the floor.\n\"You first,\" said Sherman and stood aside.\n\nThe dancer wriggled through and reached back a hand to pull him after.\nHe dived, grunted, pushed--made it. As they turned to slide down the\nother side of the heap, he looked back. A little rivulet of something\nwhite, hot and liquid was creeping through the ruins of the machine and\ninto the room.\n\nUp the passage, strewn with wreckage, but with no more blockades, into\nthe upper machine room. The machines here also were deserted and from\none of them issued a minor variation on the roaring sound they had heard\nin their own room. The guard was not on duty. They turned, sped up the\nnext passage to the place where the cars ordinarily met them. The\ncar-track was dark; by the illumination from the passage they could see\nthe rail on which it ran, a foot or two down from the level of the\npassage, and about a foot broad--a single shining ribbon of metal.\nSherman looked in one direction, then the other. Nothing. The roaring\nbehind them continued.\n\n\"Drive on, kid,\" said Marta Lami. \"The boojums are going to get us if we\nwait.\"\n\n\"Stop, look, listen, watch out for the cars,\" he quoted as they leaped\ndown and both laughed.\n\nThe roadbed was as smooth as glass, the rail set flush with it. Judging\nthat the best route was the one taking them upward Sherman turned to the\nright and they began climbing, hand in metal hand.\n\nThe track was on a curve as well as an ascent. After a few steps they\nwere in complete darkness and could only feel their way along, running\ninto the wall every few minutes. They climbed for what seemed hours. The\ntunnel continued dark, without branches, simply winding on and on.\nFinally, so quickly that Sherman missed his step, they reached a level\nplace, rounded one more curve, and saw ahead of them a band of light\nacross the track from some side-tunnel.\n\n\"Shall we try it?\" he asked as they reached the opening.\n\n\"Might be another machine room,\" she said, \"but let's go. This track is\nterrible. If I wasn't made of iron I'd have bruises all over.\"\n\nHe vaulted over the sill, reached down and hauled her after him. From\nbehind them came the roar, sunk to a vague purring by the distance. They\nwere in another granite-lined passage; one that went straight ahead for\na few yards, then branched sharply. The right hand fork seemed to lead\ndownward; automatically they took the other turn. A diffused radiance\nfrom somewhere high in the walls, as though the granite had been\nrendered transparent here and there, filled the whole place with\nshadowless light. For a time the passage ran level, then it climbed\nagain, with another fork to the right, which dipped away from their\nlevel and which they again avoided. Of any other living being there was\nthus far no sign.\n\nThe passage began climbing again, in a tight spiral, this time.\n\n\"Good thing we're in training,\" remarked Marta Lami. \"This is worse than\nthe stairs in the Statue of Liberty.\"\n\n\"Oh, did you fall for climbing that, too?\" asked Sherman.\n\n\"Sure. Publicity stunt about a year ago. Dumb bunny of a publicity man.\nPhotographed on the old lady's spikes. Never will again.\"\n\nThe spiral ended, a side passage branched off. The dancer stopped.\n\n\"Sh,\" she said, \"someone's coming. Duck in here.\" She seized Sherman's\nhand and led him into the side passage, down which they ran for a few\nfeet, then paused to look back. Down the passage they had just vacated\ncame a group of the ape-men, four or five of them, each carrying on his\nleft arm a long, cylindrical shield like those one sees in pictures of\nRoman soldiers, and in his right hand some instrument that looked like\na fire extinguisher with a long, flexible nozzle.\n\nEach of the group wore one of the helmets and behind them, wearing a\nsimilar headgear to which all the tubes were connected from the\nape-men's helmets came one of the Lassans. The group hurried past\nwithout a sideward glance, the metal feet of the ape-men ringing oddly\nloud on the granite of the echoing passage. After a minute Sherman and\nthe dancer crept cautiously forward; the procession had gone straight on\ndown. Very likely a wrecking crew.\n\nSherman and Marta sprinted up the passage in the direction from which\nthe ape-men and their guide had come. The passage no longer rose with\nthe same steepness, and as the ascent grew more gentle, the tunnel\nwidened, with frequent side-passages to the right and branches leading\ndown to the track at the left. Finally, after a sharp turn, it opened\nout into a big room, untenanted like all they had seen so far, filled\nwith a complex maze of machinery, but machinery of a different character\nfrom that they had labored at. At the farther end of the room a door\nstood open. They dashed across it, plunged through--and found themselves\nin one of the enormous blue-domed halls, whose ceiling seemed to stretch\nmiles above them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt must have been all of three hundred feet across, and there was no\nvisible support for the ceiling. All about the place stood various\nobjects and pieces of machinery, and figures moved dimly among the\ntitanic apparatus at the far end. But what most attracted their\nattention was the huge object that stood right before them.\n\nIt looked like a metal fish on an enormous scale. Fully fifty feet long\nand twenty feet high, its immense proportions dwarfed everything about\nit, and its sides, of brilliantly polished metal, shone like a mirror.\nThe tail came to a stubby point, from which projected a circle of four\ntubes; down the side was a rib which ended in a similar tube about half\nway, and at the nose-end of the mechanical fish was a ten-foot snout,\nnot unlike an elephant's trunk in shape and apparently made of the same\nrubbery material which held the cables of the helmets.\n\nMarta pulled Sherman down behind the thing, and they peered around the\nedge seeking for a means of egress from the room. The nearest was twenty\nor thirty feet away. Watching their opportunity, they chose a moment\nwhen they seemed least likely to attract attention and made a dive for\nit.\n\nThey found themselves in another passage, terminating in two doors.\n\n\"Which?\" asked Sherman.\n\n\"Eeny-meeny,\" said Marta--\"this one,\" and stepping boldly to the right\nhand door, pushed it open....\n\nFor a moment they could only gaze. The room they had entered was another\nand smaller blue-domed hall. Around its sides was a row of curious\ntwisted benches of green material, each of which was now occupied by one\nof the Lassans, hood thrown back from head, and elephant-trunk thrust\ninto a large pool of some viscous, green stuff with bright yellow flecks\nin it, in the center of the circle. Half a dozen helmeted ape-men stood\nbehind the benches of their masters, apparently serving them at this\nsingular meal.\n\n[Illustration: Half a dozen ape-men stood behind the benches of their\nmasters apparently serving at this singular meal.]\n\nAs the two humans entered there was one of those silences which are\npregnant with events. Then:\n\n\"Good evening, folks. How's the boy?\" said Marta, and curtsied\ngracefully.\n\nThe sound of her words seemed to release the spell. With a bellow of\nrage the nearest Lassan leaped from his bench, fumbling at one of the\npouches in his cloak. \"The light-gun!\" thought Sherman and braced\nhimself to spring, but another of the masters extended his trunk and\ndetained the first one. There was a momentary babble of rumbling\nconversation, then one of the Lassans reached behind him, picked up a\nhelmet and placed it on his head, and attaching a tube to one of the\nape-men, rose.\n\nThe ape-man moved toward Marta and Sherman like a being in a dream. They\nturned to run, but the Lassan produced a light-gun with such evident\nintention of using it at the first motion that they paused.\n\n\"Looks like we're in for it,\" said the dancer. \"Oh, well, lead on\nNapoleon. What do we care for expenses?\"\n\nUnder the direction of the Lassan the ape-man took them each by an arm\nand led them back through the hall of the metal fish, down among the\nmachines, where two or three others stared at them curiously or lifted\ninquisitive trunks in their direction. Then into another passage which\nhad one of the inevitable car-tracks. Their Lassan conductor reached\naround the corner into the passage, applied his trunk briefly to\nsomething and a moment later one of the cars slid silently into\nposition. The door opened.\n\n\"So long, old scout,\" said Marta Lami. \"Even if I never see you again,\nwe had a great time together.\"\n\n\"So long,\" replied Sherman, taking his place in the car. He felt a\ndistinct pang at leaving this dancer--vulgar, no doubt, and flippant,\nbut gay and debonair, and the best of companions.\n\nThe car did not take them far. It discharged Sherman in a little passage\nbefore a narrow door, which opened automatically to admit him to a small\nblue-domed room containing nothing but a seat, one of the benches on\nwhich he had seen the Lassans reclining and a mass of wires and tubes.\nThere seemed nothing in particular to do. He was at liberty, save that\nthe door closed firmly behind him, cutting off escape, and seeing that\nhe was left alone, he seated himself and began to examine the machinery,\nmost of which was attached to his chair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe Lassan Explains\n\n\nBefore he had time to riddle out any of its secrets the door opened\nagain and one of the Lassans came in--a distinctly different type than\nany he had hitherto seen. This one was smaller than most; his skin,\nwhere exposed, was covered by a tracery of fine wrinkles and his\ncoloring was whiter than the rest. Little crowfeet stood around the\ncorners of his eyes, giving him an expression that was singularly\nhumorous. He approached Sherman on noiseless feet, moved his trunk up\nand down as though examining him and then, producing from a pocket in\nhis cloak one of the thought-helmets, set it on Sherman's head,\ntightened a connection or two with his trunk and placing a like device\non his own head, settled himself on the twisted bench.\n\nThe ordeal of the helmet! \"They make you think whatever they want you\nto; it's like being hypnotized,\" Marta Lami had said. He braced himself\nresolutely. This alien intelligence should not plumb his thoughts\nwithout a struggle....\n\nTo his surprise, there seemed no attempt to force his mind. The thought\nleaped up, unbidden, \"Why, this--this Lassan is friendly!\" No definite\nimage or plan or connection of ideas formed itself in his brain; he\nmerely felt enormously soothed and strengthened. After all, he found\nhimself arguing, nobody desired to hurt him; merely to discover what\ncurious process of thought had led him to act as he had.\n\n\"You are too intelligent, too high a type to have been put to work at\nthe machines,\" came the unspoken thought of the Lassan. \"We might better\nhave put you at the controls of one of the fighting machines.\" (This\nthought caused a mental image of the giant silver fish he had seen in\nthe hall of the dome to rise in his mind; he pictured himself as seated\namid a mass of levers before a panel set with complex gauges.)\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" the thought he was receiving went on, \"that you were\nsent there. The Alphen of the mental department, who had your case in\ncharge should have known better. You earth-men make much better machines\nthan the ones we brought with us. You do not even need the helmets in\norder to control. Some of you are even capable of understanding and\noperating the lights.\" (This, he explained afterward appeared not as a\nconsecutive sentence in Sherman's mind, but as a succession of ideas,\nalmost as though he were thinking them himself. With the word \"lights\" a\ncomplex picture presented itself, involving the light-guns and a large\namount of other complex apparatus, whose exact uses he did not then or\nlater understand, but which he felt he understood at the moment.)\n\n\"Now,\" the Lassan's thought went on, \"I don't blame you for being\nfrightened and trying to run away, but you know we are different and I\ndon't quite understand what frightened you. You were working at a\nmachine, were you not?\" And as Sherman unconsciously thought of himself\nsticking his fingers in the apertures of the machines, \"I thought so.\nWhat happened?\"\n\nUnbidden, the memory of the explosion came to him. Again he heard the\nLassan's step in the corridor, saw the guard move aside, the sputter\nfrom the cable, and then the explosion; then his memory jumped to the\nmoment of tugging at the stones with the roar and heat all round and the\nwhite-hot stream in pursuit.\n\nA vague, but sympathetic thought reached him, followed by a\nquestion--\"But what made that happen? You're intelligent, you understand\nthese things, you are a mechanic--what made it happen?\"\n\nWith a start of surprise Sherman realized that the Lassan had been\nleading him gently along from place to place--to trap him! He struggled\ndesperately to keep the thought of the short-circuiting of the guard's\nhelmet from his mind; struggled to think about anything else at\nall--thought of a plate of steaming corned beef and cabbage, of the\nmultiplication table--5 x 5 = 25, all in neat rows of figures, thought\nof how to control a plane that had gone into a tail-spin....\n\nThe pressure suddenly relaxed, the mind opposite his became friendly\nagain; once more he received the vague intimation of sympathy and\nunderstanding, even of admiration of his mental strength.\n\n\"Why,\" the thought was telling him, \"you have quite as much mentality as\na Lassan! That is a very high compliment. I have never before met one of\nthe lower animals who could withhold his thoughts from me. It is most\nextraordinary. Is it possible for you to withhold your thoughts from\nyour own kind as well?\"\n\nNot at all difficult, thought Sherman, relaxing a bit; indeed the\ndifficulty in human communication lies not in withholding thoughts but\nin expressing them.\n\nHis interlocutor went on, \"Ah, but the feeling, the thought is generally\nunderstood, though it may not be clear. Tell me, have you never withheld\na thought from someone who wished to know it?\"\n\nYes, thought Sherman, I have--and remembered the poker game at the\nCleveland airport when he had drawn two cards and unexpectedly filled a\nstraight flush to win the biggest pot of the evening from Barney's full\nhouse; and of the time when he had thought of numerous unpleasant ways\nof slaying the mechanic who had left a leak in his oil-line and of the\ntime when a girl had tried to gold-dig him and he had divined her\nintention first, and of the time when he had lifted the knife--!!!\n\nAgain that jar! He realized with a start that the Lassan having failed\nto pick his brain with friendliness, was trying to do it with flattery,\nand the realization so filled him with anger that he had no difficulty\nin resisting the pressure that was applied to make him tell, tell, tell\nwhat had happened in the machine-room at the end of the passage.\n\nOnce more the pressure relaxed. The Lassan was congratulating him again.\n\"No, this is sincere this time and not flattery. You win. I shall not\ntry to make you tell me again. We can probably obtain it from the other\none anyway. Oh, man of a debased and alien race, I salute you. If your\nrace were all like you we might breed them for intelligence and live in\ncooperation with you. It is almost a pity you had to be mechanized. If\nthere is any information you wish, I will gladly exchange with you. We\nhave seen your homes, we are curious--imagine living above the\nground!--and from others of your race we know that you have many fine\nmachines, almost a civilization, in fact. We would willingly know more\nof it and in return will tell you of our accomplishments.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCould this offer conceal some new trap? Sherman wondered, but the Lassan\ndivined this thought as soon as formed, and reassured him. \"Since we now\nlive here and since there are so few of your folk left it is important\nthat we know about each other. We must live side by side--why not in\nfriendship?\"\n\nThe offer seemed fair enough. At all events if there were any\ninjudicious questions he could turn them aside, and there was a good\ndeal he wished to learn--about his mechanized body, about the purpose of\nthose curious machines, the blue-domed halls, the silver fish, the\ninterweavings of this underground city, where the Lassans had come\nfrom--he assented.\n\n\"Good,\" the message reached him. \"Suppose you ask a question and then I\nwill. What do you wish to know?\"\n\n\"How I was made into a machine.\"\n\n\"I do not know that I can explain it to you. I perceive your knowledge\nof the nature of light is elementary.... But the material with which we\nsurrounded the space-ship in which we came, in order to protect it from\nthe radiation of suns unknown to you, has a powerful action on all\nanimal substances. It is a material not unlike your radium, but a\nthousand times more powerful. When we reached your planet, your\natmosphere carried it to every part of the earth, and all living things\nreceived it. Those who were most affected by it were turned to metal\nwhich retained that quality called 'life' within its interior reaches;\nthe others became merely solid metal.\n\n\"Our birds are under instructions to bring us all such individuals as\npossess life. In our laboratories we make their forms over, so they will\nbe useful to us as servants. Those who have become solid, of course,\nnothing can be done for. We have found in the past that when we take a\nnew planet and make the individuals over into machines, unless we return\nthem to familiar surroundings, they lose their brains when they reawake.\nTherefore you woke in the same place in which you passed from\nconsciousness.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" said Sherman, \"and where do you come from and how did you\nget here?\"\n\nHe felt the Lassan's amusement. \"That is two questions you have asked,\nand not one. Nevertheless I will answer. We come from a planet of\nanother star, very far away--I do not know how to express it to you.\nYour methods of measurement for these things are different from ours.\"\nIn Sherman's mind appeared a picture of the night heavens with the\ntremendous ribbon of the Milky Way swinging across its center; his\nattention was directed to one star, a very bright one.\n\n\"Rigel!\" his mind called, and the thought went on. He was suddenly\ntransported to the neighborhood of the star, felt that it was ages ago,\nlong before the earth had cooled, and saw that the star, then a sun like\nour own, was threatened by some enormous catastrophe, a titanic\nexplosion. Abruptly the picture was wiped out and he beheld the comet,\nthe great comet the earthly astronomers had watched for so long before\nit struck on that fateful night, and realized that it was no comet, but\nan interplanetary vehicle bound from the planet of Rigel to the earth.\n\n[Illustration: The star, like our own sun, was threatened by some\nenormous catastrophe, a titanic explosion.]\n\n\"But how--?\" he began to frame another question. The Lassan cut across\nit firmly. \"It is my turn to seek information now. We are interested in\nthe machine that brought you here--the bird machine. How does it\noperate?\"\n\nSherman imagined himself in the airplane's seat, operating the controls\nand as well as he could to a strange type of mind, explained how they\nworked. \"But what drives it?\" insisted the Lassan. \"I do not understand.\nNo, not the queer thing at the front that turns round. We have that\nprinciple ourselves. But the thing that makes it turn.\"\n\nFor answer, Sherman tried to picture the interior of the engine and show\nthe gasoline exploding and driving it. The mind opposite his became\nthoughtful at once, and then flashed a question. \"Are there\nmany--explosives--in this earth?\"\n\nSherman pictured gunpowder, dynamite and all the others he could think\nof. He at once sensed that the Lassan was both astonished and troubled.\nSomething like a mental curtain which he could not pierce, dropped\nbetween them. A moment later the elephant-man rose.\n\n\"That will be sufficient for the present,\" he flashed, and came forward\nto remove the helmet from Sherman's head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few moments later the door was swung open; Sherman saw that one of the\ncars was waiting for him with the word \"EXIT\" beckoning him on and he\nwas soon back in his cage.\n\nAs nearly as he could judge time, he was left alone for quite\ntwenty-four hours before being recalled for further questioning. As soon\nas he entered the interrogation room he perceived that something serious\nhad engaged the attention of the Lassans. The seat was prepared for him\nas before, but instead of one of the twisted benches, there were now\nthree. His acquaintance, the old Lassan, occupied the center one; on one\nside was a chubby elephant-man whose obesity gave a singularly infantile\nexpression to his features and on the other a slender-limbed type, as\nthough by contrast. All three had tubes connected to the helmet which\nwas placed on his head, but he soon recognized that the older Lassan was\nthe only one to ask questions.\n\n\"We wish to ask you about these explosives,\" came the message. \"Are they\nall alike?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered instantly.\n\n\"What causes them to explode?\"\n\n\"I am not a chemist. I don't know.\" The idea of chemistry was slightly\nunfamiliar to them; it was apparent from their thoughts that chemistry\nhad never occurred to them as the subject of a special study. Then came\nanother question, \"Are there many chemists?\"\n\nAn idea struck Sherman. He closed his mind resolutely against the\nquestion and flashed back the message that he had come to learn as well\nas teach. He sensed a certain annoyance among the new auditors, but the\nold Lassan answered, \"That is only just. What do you wish to know?\"\n\n\"What the machines are for.\"\n\n\"In the center of this as of every other earth lies the substance of\nlife, as it lies at the heart of every sun. The machines pierce to it\nand draw it up for our uses.\"\n\n\"What is this substance of life?\"\n\n\"You would not understand if we told you. Sufficient that it is nothing\nknown on the surface of your world. Your idea that most nearly\napproaches it is--\" he paused for a moment, feeling about in Sherman's\nmind for the proper expression \"--is pure light; light having material\nbody and strength. Now let me ask--do you use explosives as we use the\nsubstance of life, to fight your enemies?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What weapons do you use them in?\"\n\nSherman thought of a revolver and then of a cannon.\n\n\"And do these weapons act at a distance?\"\n\n\"Yes. May I ask a question?\"\n\n\"If it is a brief one. This interview is important to us.\"\n\n\"How many of your people are there on the earth?\"\n\n\"It is inadvisable to answer that fully, but there are some hundreds.\nNow tell us, are there any of these weapons near this place?\"\n\nSherman thought. West Point--Watervliet Arsenal--Iona Island, leaped\ninto his mind. All three Lassans leaned back with a sigh of satisfaction\nand exchanged thoughts among themselves so rapidly that he could not\nfollow the process. Then the two younger Lassans disconnected their\nhelmets and the older one said,\n\n\"We are disposed to be generous to you, we will demonstrate one of our\nfighting machines to you if you will show us how to use these\nexplosives.\"\n\nThere could be no particular harm in it, he argued to himself. The army\nwas a thing of the past, and if there were other people out in the\nworld, and he could take them a knowledge of the Lassan fighting\nmachines it would be of as much value as any information he could give.\nHe agreed.\n\nThe old Lassan rose. \"You will retain your helmet. It is a rule that\nnone of the lower races are allowed in the fighting machines without\nthem, and you would be unable to control one without our help in any\ncase.\"\n\nThe car carried them to the blue-domed hall where he and Marta Lami had\nhidden behind the shining fish. A little pang of loneliness leaped up in\nhim at the sight; he wondered where she was and whether she had been\nsent back to the machines. \"No,\" the Lassan's thought answered his, \"the\nother servant has not been returned to the machines. Many of them are\nnot working as a result of the recent trouble and the servant has been\nplaced on other work instead. But I do not understand your idea that the\nother servant is somehow different from you.\"\n\n\"Do the Lassans, then, have no sex?\" the thought raced through his\nbrain.\n\n\"Sex? Oh, I understand. The difference between two of the lower soft\nraces that makes reproduction possible. Our birds have it. No, we have\nabolished it of course, as all higher races have. Our young are produced\nartificially.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA Dash for Freedom\n\n\nThey stood before the big machine. \"You must do exactly as I tell you,\"\nthe Lassan informed him. \"The machinery of this instrument is very\ndelicate. First, to enter, you must reach up there, by that fin, and\ninsert one of your fingers in the hole you will find.\"\n\nAs he did so Sherman saw a door, so closely fitted that when it closed\nthere was no visible seam in the metal, swing back. They entered.\n\nThe interior of the machine was disappointingly smaller than its outside\nwould have led one to expect. A narrow walk, railed on both sides, led\ndown the center to the forward part. Along and slightly below this walk\nwas a row of instrument boards not unlike those of the mining machine,\nand at each of these one of the ape-men lay, helmet on head, apparently\nasleep. \"No, not asleep,\" the Lassan told him, \"they do not require it,\nlike all our mechanical servants. They have merely been thrown into a\nstate of nothingness till we need them.\"\n\nAt the prow of the machine the cat-walk widened into a control chamber.\nOne of the Lassan couches was here and above it dangled a helmet which\nwas connected with those of the slumbering ape-men. The Lassan removed\nthe helmet he wore and exchanged it for this. Before this was another\nseat in which Sherman took his position. A complex of controls\nsurrounded him, most of them with the fingerholes which were the\nordinary Lassan method of handling machinery. Directly in front of this\nseat was a ground-glass panel, now dark but which lit up as soon as the\nLassan had connected up his helmet, to give an accurate picture of the\nhall in which the fighting machine stood.\n\n\"And can you see to a distance?\" Sherman wondered. The answer he\nreceived was either confused or beyond his comprehension. He gathered\nthat the four-winged birds of the Lassans acted in some way or other as\ntheir scouts, remaining in a kind of telepathic communication with the\nLassan in the fighting-machine they were assigned to help....\n\nSherman was surprised to find how readily the enormous bulk and weight\nof the thing handled under the Lassan's skilled control. He understood,\nwithout definitely asking, that the power was furnished by that\n\"substance of life\" to which the Lassan had referred; in some way\nconnected with the absolute destruction of matter....\n\nThe door swung open before them, leading them down a passage that went\nup for some distance, then through an immense room where some twenty\nmore of these giants lay stored, through it, and with surprising\nsuddenness into the bright sunlight of a Catskill autumn day. As they\nemerged the viewing plate swung round to show them three of the big\nfour-winged birds go whirring up from some unseen covert, spiral into\nthe air above them and flying level with them, form an escort.\n\nLike most mail aviators, Sherman held a commission in the Army Reserve\nand had been to West Point. It was not difficult for him to guide the\ngreat fighting machine there, to find a field gun and ammunition and\nload it into the fighting machine. He knew very little about artillery\nof any kind, but when they returned to the door of the Lassan city, he\nwas enough of a mechanic to get the shell into the breech and find the\nfiring mechanism. The gun went off with an earsplitting crack and the\nshell whistled down the valley to burst against a green hillside where\nthey saw a graceful pine dip and fall to the shock.\n\nAnd just at that moment such a sense of disturbance and alarm invaded\nSherman's mind as he had never felt before. He looked around; the group\nof Lassans who had poured out of the city to see the experiment with the\ngun was gathered in a tight knot, eagerly conversing with one another.\nThe old Lassan who was conducting him turned round abruptly. \"Into the\nfighting-machine at once,\" he commanded. \"Our birds have sent a message\nthat they are being attacked by some strange creature of your world.\"\n\nAs Sherman climbed through the door of the fighting machine he glanced\nover his shoulder to see, far down the valley a black speck against the\nsky. An airplane? he wondered and it suddenly occurred to him that\nhowever great his thirst for information, he should have kept his\nknowledge of guns from the Lassans; for if there were other people alive\nout there in the world the day might come when it would be a battle--and\nexplosives were as new to the Lassans as the light-ray to the children\nof men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that it became a struggle.\n\nSherman found he had to be constantly on his guard; constantly he had to\nconceal knowledge from the probing, insistent mind-helmets. The Lassans\nseemed interested in only one subject now: human methods of making war,\nhuman guns, human armor, human ships. Once they brought him an\nencyclopedia and as he held it on his lap went over every word of the\narticles on military subjects, questioning and cross-questioning him.\nFortunately, it was an old encyclopedia, and he knew so little about it\nthat in most cases he was able to throw open his mind and let his\nopponents see that it lay empty on these subjects. And still they were\nnot satisfied.\n\nYet if he gave information, he also received it; for little by little an\nunderstanding of the subtle material they called pure light became part\nof his mental equipment....\n\nOne day, as he returned from a long session in the questioning room and\nhis cage clicked into position behind him, he was startled by a cheery,\nstrident voice:\n\n\"Well, well, if it isn't my old pal, Herbie. How's the boy?\"\n\nSherman looked around. In the next cage was Marta Lami, grinning and\nextending her hand through the bars.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake!\" he said, and took the offered hand. \"How did you\nget here?\"\n\n\"How does anyone get anywhere around this place? In one of those patent\nFords of theirs.\"\n\nThey gazed at each other for a moment, too glad of a familiar face to\nmake the ordinary banal remarks. The dancer spoke first:\n\n\"Well, did they put the screws on you, big boy? They tried to pump me\nabout that accident but all I'd think about was how good Broadway would\nlook with all the lights, and they didn't make much out of me.\"\n\n\"I'll say they put the screws on me. They've had me in there every day\nsince, trying to find out something about guns.\"\n\n\"Guns? What t'hell! Ain't they got that light-ray? They could give cards\nand spades to all the guns in the world with that. Wait a minute,\nthough....\" She thought for a moment. \"Do you know, I think they're\nscared yellow about something and I'll bet a hundred dollars against a\ncase of bathtub gin I know what it is.\"\n\n\"Yeh? Spring it. They keep pumping me and I'd like to know what it's all\nabout.\"\n\nThe dancer glanced around. On the far side of her cage was an\ninattentive ape-man tossing his oil-ball about, across the corridor\nanother. \"Come over here,\" she said. \"They haven't put me next to you\nfor the fun of it, and they may have a dictaphone stuck around\nsomewhere.\"\n\nObediently Sherman approached the bars of the cage.\n\n\"They put me to work making those fighting-machines,\" she whispered,\n\"you know, those big shiny things like we hid behind that day we tried\nto make the break. They had the helmets on me most of the time because I\ndidn't know how to use their tools and machines and I got a lot of what\nthe guy that was running me was thinking about. He was damn nervous\nabout something, and I think it was because there are some people\noutside going to take a whack at these babies.\"\n\n\"People like--us?\" asked Sherman.\n\n\"I don't know. I didn't get it very good, but I think they're ordinary\nflesh-and-blood people. They came and got a lot of the dopeys from the\nroom where I lived the other day and put them in one of the new\nfighting-machines and took it out. It never came back.\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" said Sherman, \"do you s'pose that was because it got cracked up\nor because they took it somewhere else?\"\n\n\"Dunno. But something's stirring.\"\n\nIf the Lassans had set a dictaphone or some similar device to spy on\nthem there was no sign of it in the conversation which Sherman's\ninterrogator held with him during the next period. But when he saw the\ndancer again, she beckoned him silently to her side, and producing from\none of her drawers a book, began to trace letters on it with a\nfingernail dipped in grease.\n\n\"_Be careful what you say_,\" she wrote. \"_They know what we're talking\nabout. They pumped me._\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Well, kid,\" he said aloud. \"What do you think? Will you ever\nmake dancers of these Lassans?\"\n\nShe giggled her appreciation of this remark for their unseen audience.\n\"I'll say I won't. They're too slow on their pins. Rather sit still and\nsuck up that green gooey than do anything. Cheez! What would I give for\nsome good music.\"\n\n\"If I had a hand-organ now--\" said Sherman. \"We've got the monk.\" He\nnodded toward the ape-man, while with his own fingernail he wrote.\n\"_How's chances of getting out of here? Do you know the way?_\"\n\n\"I'll speak to one of the big shots tomorrow,\" she said aloud. \"Maybe we\ncan get him to let us run a show.\" On the book's flyleaf appeared the\nwords. \"_Only from the work-room on. It has an outside door._\"\n\n\"How would I do as a dancing partner?\" asked Sherman. \"_Good_,\" he\nwrote. \"_I've doped out how to work these cars. Are you game for a try\nat it?_\"\n\n\"You haven't got the figure,\" she said. \"I'd rather dance with that old\npapa Lassan that does the questions.\" \"_Sure_,\" she wrote, \"_any time\nyou say._\"\n\nThey broke off the conversation at this point, and Sherman set himself\nto study out a plan for escape. He had watched the cars intently both\ninside and out. The same needle arrangement that released the cage bars,\napparently, actuated the mechanism of the car doors, and it was located\ninside. This meant that he could secure admission to the same car that\ncarried the girl, and with luck, would be able to get out at the same\ntime she did. What to do after that was a matter of chance and\ninspiration. If only he had a weapon!... The oil and grease balls. They\nwould do to throw--might spoil a Lassan's aim or check the rush of one\nof the ape-man servants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs finally arranged between them the plan was that he was to get in the\nsame car she did. She would tap on the back of her compartment to assure\nhim that everything was in order, and tap again when the door opened for\nher to get out. He would leave her a second to get her bearings, then\nthey would make a rush of it. He weighed the usefulness of the knife as\na weapon and discarded it--too clumsy for throwing and in a close\nstruggle with one of the ape-men slaves, made of metal like himself, it\nwould be quite useless. But another tool, rather like a short-handled\nand badly shaped hammer, he did take.\n\nAt last the hour arrived. The car ran down the line of cages, paused;\nopened before Marta Lami's. She smiled at him, nodded, and purposely\ndelayed getting in. He fumbled desperately with his needle, fearing he\ncould not make it, then it went home, the little arm at the bottom of\nthe car swung out and its door opened. As he stepped in he heard the\ndancer's tap of encouragement from the compartment ahead.\n\nEvidently it was some little distance to the work room. The car made\nseveral stops on the way, but Sherman, braced and ready, listened in\nvain for the tap that would tell him they had reached their destination.\nAt last it came; two soft knocks. He bent, thrust home the needle. The\ndoor slid back, and he stepped out into one of the blue-domed rooms. His\neyes caught a fantastic maze of machinery, helmeted ape-men busy at it\nand beyond them the huge forms of several uncompleted fighting machines.\n\nThe dancer gripped his hand. \"This way,\" she said, pointing along the\nwall past the machines. \"Take it easy; don't run till they notice us.\"\n\nA feverish passion for activity burned in him. \"Hurry, hurry,\" called\nevery sense, but he fought it down and followed Marta Lami down the line\nof machines, past the impassive ape-men.\n\nThey made over half the distance to the door before they were spotted.\nThen one of the Lassans, who had sauntered over to the car stop,\nevidently expecting Marta, missed her and looked around. The first\nwarning the two had was a sudden flickering of blue lights here and\nthere among the machines. \"Come on,\" shouted Marta. \"There she goes!\"\n\nSherman looked over his shoulder, saw the Lassan tugging at his pouch\nfor a ray-gun, and paused to throw one of the oil-balls, straight and\ntrue, as one pitches a baseball. It struck the elephant-man squarely\nbetween the eyes, at the base of his trunk. He squealed with pain and\nfright and dropping the ray-gun, ran behind a machine. For a second all\nthe eyes in the room turned toward him; then with another flickering of\nlights, the hunt was up.\n\nSherman saw a helmeted ape-man at a machine just ahead turn slowly\nround, gazing vacantly, and then fling himself at Marta. As she\nside-stepped to avoid his rush, Sherman swung his left from the heels.\nThe metal fist took the slave flush on the jaw, and down he went with a\ncrash. The dazzling spout of a ray-gun shot past them, spattering\nagainst the wall in a shower of stars, and they had reached the exit.\n\n\"Come, oh come!\" shouted Marta, tugging at the heavy door. Sherman\npulled with her, and at that moment another ray-gun flash struck it,\njust over their heads. The door gave suddenly; they tumbled through.\n\nInto a gray twilight they struggled, shot with little dashes of rain\nthat had beaten the valley to mud.\n\n\"Cheez!\" said Marta, struggling through the gelatinous stuff. \"If I live\nthrough this, I'll live to be a million.\"\n\n\"No, not that way,\" called Sherman. \"They'll look for us down the valley.\nCome on, up the hill.\"\n\nHe pulled her upward. They slipped, stumbled, slid, gripped the stump of\na tree, then another. Below and behind them came a confused rumble and\nthey heard the great door swing open again. A burst of light, like a\nstar in the cloudy dark, broke out, and Sherman pulled the girl down\nbehind the stump of a huge tree.\n\n\"What do you s'pose they'll bring after us?\" he whispered, his lips\nclose to her ear.\n\n\"Dunno. One of the little machines maybe. Look.\"\n\nSherman peered cautiously round his side of the stump. In the valley\nbeneath them, shining brilliantly in the pure white light it had\nreleased, was one of the metal fish--but a smaller one than the usual\nfighting machine, and without the projecting trunk.\n\n\"We've been working on them for a while,\" the girl whispered. \"I don't\nknow what they're for, but they aren't fighting machines.\"\n\nRemembering how the vision plate of the fighting machine he had\ncontrolled had reflected every object within range, Sherman made himself\nsmall behind the stump. The machine below was probably trying to locate\nthem in the light it had released.\n\n\"Wonder they don't bring the birds out,\" he thought, and as if in answer\nto this idea, one of the four-winged creatures strutted around the\nmachine, blinking in the light, then took off with a whir of wings, and\nspiralled upward. The light went out, reappeared as a beam, pointing\ndown the valley and the machine moved off, slowly sweeping the sides of\nthe hills with its pencil of illumination. He could see the multiple\nglow of the tubes at the stern, greenly phosphorescent, as the machine\nprogressed. High above the bird screamed shrilly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nMarta's Sacrifice\n\n\nProgress up the hillside was slow. It had become completely dark; they\nwere without any means of making a light and would not have dared to\nmake one if they could. The mud was tenacious, the constant contact with\nstumps and rocks both irritating and difficult. But at last in their\nfumbling way, they reached a spot where the denudation gave place to a\nline of trees, looming dark and friendly overhead against the skyline,\nand after that they went faster. Where they were or what route to take\nneither had any idea. That portion of the Catskills is still as wild as\nin the days of the Iroquois, save for the few thin roads along the line\nof the valleys and these they dared not seek.\n\nThey solved the difficulty by keeping to the hillcrest till it ran out\nin a valley, then rapidly climbing the next hill and proceeding along\nthat in the shelter of the forest. Though they necessarily went slowly\nthey did not halt; neither felt the need of rest or sleep, their metal\nlimbs took no serious bruises, and the slip of the hill kept them from\nrunning in circles as people usually do when lost in the woods.\n\nJust as the eastern sky began to hold some faint promise of dawn they\ncame upon a farmhouse in a clearing at the top of a hill. It was an\nunprepossessing affair with a sagging roof, but they burst in the door\nand went through it in the hope of finding weapons and perhaps an\nelectric battery, for both were used to the bountiful electric meals of\nthe Lassans and were beginning to feel the lack.\n\nThe best the place afforded, however, was a rather ancient axe, of which\nSherman possessed himself, and a large pot of vaseline with which they\nanointed themselves liberally, for the continued damp was making them\nfeel rusty in the joints.\n\nThey pressed on, and did not halt to consider the situation till full\nday had come.\n\n\"Where do we go from here?\" asked Marta, perching herself on a\ntree-bole.\n\n\"South, I guess,\" offered Sherman. \"They may be looking for us there,\nbut we got to find a city and get some things.\"\n\n\"There's Albany,\" she suggested.\n\n\"Yes, and Schenectady and they have a lot of electric power there we\ncould use. But I vote for New York. If we head in there I can pick up a\nplane at one of the airports and walk right away from them.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a chance,\" she said, \"but anything is. Come on....\" and as\nthey forced their way through the underbrush, \"You know, from what I\nunderstood of those Lassans' thoughts, they've got something hot cooking\nup. I'm almost sure there are other people in the world and they're\ngetting ready to fight them.\"\n\n\"Let 'em come,\" said Sherman grimly. \"That light-ray won't stand the\nchance of a whistle in a whirlwind when they get after them with heavy\nartillery and airplane observation.\"\n\n\"That's just where you're all wet,\" replied the dancer. \"They've been\nfiguring on that for a long time. They got a gun from somewhere, and\nthey've had all their fighting machines out, shooting it at them, and\nthen armoring up the fighting machines to stand it. And they're\nbuilding guns of their own to shoot those light-bombs. I ought to know.\nI was on the job.\"\n\nSherman cursed himself inwardly. So that had been the result of his\nexchange of information with the old Lassan who was so anxious to know\nabout guns.\n\n\"How do they get away from it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, I don't know quite,\" she said. \"I'm a sap about stuff like that.\nAll I know is what the guy that was controlling me thought about and let\nme have without knowing it. But I got this much out of it--that the\noutside of these fighting machines is coated with this 'substance of\nlife' they talk about some way, so it's a perfect mirror, and reflects\neverything that hits it, even shells. The coating reflects their light\nray, too, but it has to have a lead backing for that. It's no good\nwithout the lead. Seems like lead will stop that light-ray every time.\"\n\n\"I wonder how about big guns,\" murmured Sherman.\n\n\"Don't know. I didn't get anything like that in what the boss was\nthinking. He seemed to imagine the gun he had was the biggest there\nwas.\"\n\nThey toiled on. As they progressed southward the thinning forest and the\nincreasing walls of the cliffs drove them farther and farther toward the\nriver, till they were forced to take to the main road willy-nilly. Along\nit they could walk faster, but there was more danger. They watched the\nheavens narrowly for any sign of the four-winged birds, but the skies\nseemed deserted.\n\nAt Kingston they found a filling station, and kicking in the door,\nlocated a couple of storage batteries that supplied them with a needed\nmeal. \"What do you say to a car?\" asked Sherman.\n\n\"Maybe yes, maybe no,\" said the dancer. \"It's running a chance, isn't\nit? Still, we're getting nowhere awful fast this way. Let's try it.\"\n\nFinding a car in running order was a procedure of some difficulty, and\nKingston seemed a weaponless town, though Marta finally did locate one\nlittle pearl-handled .25 calibre pop-gun. Sherman eyed it dubiously.\n\n\"That's a good thing to kill mosquitoes with,\" he remarked, \"but I don't\nthink it will be much use for anything else.\"\n\n\"Boloney,\" she replied. \"These Lassans are yellow from way back. If I\nstuck this under the nose of one of them he'd throw a fit. Come on.\nLet's go.\"\n\nEventlessly, the road flowed past under their wheels--Newburgh,\nHaverstraw, Nyack--one, two, three hours. Then, just south of Chester\nthe dancer suddenly gripped Sherman's arm.\n\n\"What's that?\" she said. \"No, over there. Isn't it--?\"\n\nBut in one swift glance he had seen as clearly as she. Like a living\nthing, the car swerved from the road, dived across the ditch, and losing\nspeed, rolled to a halt on the green lawn of a suburban bungalow.\nSherman leaped out. \"Come on, for God's sake,\" he cried. \"It's a\nfighting machine. If they've seen us they'll start shooting.\"\n\nDragging her after him, he dived around the house, through a seedy\nflower-garden, down a path. As though to lend emphasis to his words\nthere came the familiar buzzing roar, and as Sherman dropped, pulling\nthe girl flat on her face after him, they saw the wall of the bungalow\ncave in, and the roof tilt slowly over and drop into the burning mass\nbeneath. A vivid blue beam, brighter than the sunlight of the dark day,\nswept across the sky, winked once or twice, and disappeared.\n\nMarta would have risen, but \"Take it easy,\" said Sherman. \"If they see\nus they'll pop another of those tokens at us.\"\n\nHe wriggled along on his stomach, picking up weeds in his body plates in\nthe process, and making for the shelter of an overgrown hedge that ran\nbehind the next bungalow.\n\n\"Look out,\" called the dancer suddenly. \"Here come the birds.\"\n\nShe waved her hand up and back, and by screwing up his eyes Sherman\ncould just make out a black speck against the clouds, far north. They\nrolled under the shelter of the hedge and lay still, scarcely daring to\nwhisper.\n\nThe Lassan in command of the fighting machine was evidently not\nsatisfied that he had hit them with his hasty shot. Peering through the\nstems, they made out the shimmering form of the machine, sliding slowly\npast the burning house, its snout moving hither and thither\nquestioningly. It passed through the garden, went on down the path. The\nbird swung to and fro overhead. Nearer. Evidently it had noticed the\nprints their feet left in the soft ground.\n\n\"Listen, partner,\" said Marta Lami, \"get through and find some people,\nthen come and get me out of that hellhole up there. If they see me,\nthey'll let you alone.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Sherman, but she was already running out across the field.\nThe snout of the machine lifted toward her as though to deliver a blast,\nthen rose and discharged another beam of blue light. Sherman heard one\nof the birds scream in answer, saw it sweep down on soaring pinions, and\nin a single motion snap the dancer up and away. The shimmering fighting\nmachine swung round and turned back toward the road.\n\nHe lay still until he was sure it had gone, then, moving carefully for\nfear of the terror from the skies, crawled to the next bungalow. It\nyielded treasure-trove in the shape of a flashlight and a serviceable\nrevolver, and securing a sheet from one of the beds to wrap around him\nas a loin-cloth, he set out to trudge to New York.\n\nAfter a time it occurred to him that the disaster had taken place not\nbecause they were in a car, but because it had been driven unreasonably\nfast, and without precaution. He looked for and ultimately found another\none, and keeping to the back streets and driving slowly, worked his way\ntoward the city again. Then another idea came to him--Newark had an\nairport as well as New York and it was far nearer. He changed the\ndirection of his advance, swinging west to avoid the long bridges over\nthe Passaic River. Bridges were focal points; the birds would surely\nwatch them, as intelligent as they were.\n\nLate in the afternoon he spied one of them, far ahead and flying\nsouthward, but took no chances. He drew his car up to the side of the\nroad and remained motionless for long after it had disappeared. When\nevening came on, he had already reached the outskirts of the city and\ncould proceed without headlights.\n\nNewark was a dead city, the diminished purr of the motor ringing\ncuriously loud in the silent streets. Their complication bothered him;\nhe was unfamiliar with the town and his flashlight gave out long before\nhe reached his destination. But he kept steadily on, certain that the\nairport was somewhere at the south and east of the city. Toward the\nlater evening a fine, cold rain began to fall, congealing to ice on the\nstreets and on his metallic body.\n\nThe airport was just as he had remembered it on the first day of his\nawakening--it now seemed uncountable ages in the past. The little sports\nplane still stood on the platform, its torn wing dangling. The hangars\nwere all locked; he was an inefficient burglar and spent an hour or two\nbreaking one open and when he did, found nothing but a tri-motored\nmonster quite beyond his powers to get out, and a rocket-plane requiring\nspecial fuel that he did not have. The next hangar yielded an autogiro\nand a training machine. He had no watch, but was sure that the night was\npassing fast, and not wishing to be abroad by daylight with an airplane,\ndecided to chance it on the autogiro. Luckily she was full of fuel, and\neverything seemed tight. With some labor he removed the chocks and\nmanaged to wheel the machine out.\n\nNot till he had it in the air did the thought of what direction he was\nto take occur to him. Boston--New York--Philadelphia--Chicago, he\ncanvassed the possibilities. What was it Marta Lami had said--something\nabout one of the fighting machines heading south? And he remembered how\nthe astronomers had predicted that the comet would fall, probably,\nsomewhere in New York State. If there were a borderline along which\nLassans were meeting humans in any kind of conflict it was most likely\nto lie southward. With this thought in mind, he turned his plane to the\nsouth, and keeping the white line of foam along the coast beneath him as\na guide, began to let her out.\n\nThe ceiling was low; between clouds and fitful squalls of rain flying\nwas difficult and the weight of Sherman's mechanical body seemed to make\nthe machine move loggily. It must have been all of an hour and three\nquarters later that he saw beneath him the tossing whitecaps of Great\nBay, with the ribbon of Wading River running back into the distance.\nJust beyond, he knew, lay Atlantic City. He was debating with himself\nwhether to land on the beach there or hop across to the Philadelphia\nairport when, sharp and clear from somewhere ahead and below him, came\nthe sound of gunfire. He tried for altitude, but only ran into clouds.\nNevertheless the sound was unmistakable, and as he approached it became\nclearer and more pronounced, a long intermittent beat, heavy guns and\nlight, mingled together, off to the right. There was fighting going on!\n\nExulting in his escape from the Lassans and in the fact that he could\ntake their opponents information that would be of value, he swung the\nautogiro toward the sounds that became clearer every minute. He was\ngetting right over them now, he thought; he could see red flashes along\nthe horizon. Down there they were locked in battle--men and Lassans, his\nown people and the invaders from far-away Rigel.\n\nSuddenly a beam of the light-ray leaped from the ground. Sherman thought\nit was directed at him; tried to loop the plane and cursed as he\nremembered autogiros wouldn't loop; then saw that the light was after\nall, not turned in his direction, but at some object on the ground. He\nbanked the plane over and swung lower. Undoubtedly a Lassan fighting\nmachine--and the beam was hitting things, things large and solid, for\nthey collapsed under the stabbing ray. A red flame rose over the wreck;\nthe roar of an explosion reached his ears. The battle-line!\n\nHe soared again. He must reach the headquarters of whatever men were\ndown there. The information he could bring and that Marta Lami had given\nhim might make all the difference between the loss of the world and its\nsalvation \"... perfect mirror--reflects everything that hits it, even\nshells, but they don't know about the big ones.... The lead will reflect\ntheir light-rays, too ... no good against lead. Their armor is made of\nthe same stuff....\"\n\nIn the darkness beneath him troops were moving. He could catch glimpses\nof dark masses on the roads. Somewhere down there he distinctly heard\nthe call of one of the four-winged birds, quite near. Then with a rush,\nit was suddenly upon him. He set the automatic pilot, and drew his\nrevolver, but the bird, unfamiliar with the machine it was attacking,\nhad dashed recklessly in. There was a rending screech as it came into\ncontact with the wings of the autogiro; Sherman got in one shot, and\nthen bird, man and plane tumbled toward the earth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThe End of the Light-Ray\n\n\n\"The Lassans?\" said General Grierson, in a puzzled tone, looking at the\nsheet-clad apparition. \"You mean these--mechanical monsters?\"\n\nSherman winced. \"Like myself? No, sir, those are their slaves. I thought\nyou were familiar with them. They are elephant-men and quite different.\"\n\n[Illustration: This shows that Mr. Pratt's conception of the elephant-men\nis not so far-fetched. This photo is Ganesha, a Hindu god, patron of art\nand literature Ganesha symbolizes to the Hindus wisdom and knowledge.]\n\n\"I meant those damned, long, shining objects that shoot that light-ray\nof theirs. Their guns shoot it out in packages, but we can understand\nthat and deal with them; our artillery is just as good. But if we can't\nstop those shining things there will be no army left and that means no\nmen left on this planet. This army is our last resource. If you know of\nanything, anything, that will stop them, for God's sake tell us! All\nwe've found that does any good so far are the twelve-inch railroad guns\nand we have only four of them. One was knocked out by their shells this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"You mean their fighting-machines,\" Sherman replied. \"Why, I'm not\nabsolutely certain. I only know what I picked up from them and what\nMarta Lami\"--he swallowed hard at the mention of her name--\"the bravest\nwoman in the world, told me. But I think that a shell with a lead cap\nwould go through those fighting machines like a knife through a piece of\ncheese.\"\n\nThere was a tiny silence in the room at this momentous announcement.\nThen an artillery officer said, dreamily, \"The armor-piercing shells the\nrailroad guns use have lead caps.\"\n\nAs though his words had released a spell there came a quick drumfire of\nquestions:\n\n\"What are they armored with?\"\n\n\"What kind of a power-plant do they use?\"\n\n\"Can you stop the light-ray?\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\nSherman smiled. \"Just a moment. One question at a time. I'm not sure I\ncan answer them all, anyway. As to what makes me think so and what\nthey're armored with, they have a coating of steel armor, but it isn't\nvery thick. It's plated on the outside with a coat of lead and outside\nthat with the substance they call 'pure light.' I don't know what it is,\nbut it's the same stuff they use in the light-ray and in their shells,\nand I know that lead sheeting will stop it, even when the lead is very\nthin.\"\n\nGeneral Grierson swung round in his chair. \"Hartnett! write out an order\nto General Hudson, Chief Quartermaster, at once. Tell him to remove\nevery piece of lead he can find in Atlantic City and get it melted down.\nAlso to set up a plant for tipping all shells with lead....\"\n\nBen Ruby leaned forward. \"Can we get into their city, their\nheadquarters, or whatever they call it?\"\n\n\"My God, I hope so!\" cried Sherman. \"Marta Lami's in there.\"\n\n\"All right, young man, you'll have your chance for that,\" said General\nGrierson. \"Now suppose you tell us as much as you know about\nthese--things. Every bit of information we can get will be valuable....\nOh, by the way, Hartnett. Have an order made out to the infantry to cut\nthe points of their bullets with their knives. That will make them\ndum-dum and bring the lead out. Also another one to evacuate as much\ninfantry as possible. They aren't going to be a great deal of use....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the factory of the Atlantic City Packing Company men were toiling,\nstripped to the waist, in an inferno of heat. The huge row of vats that\nhad once held clams, oysters and fish to grace a nation's palate, now\nsimmered with green-phosphorescent kettles of molten lead; the hand\ntrucks that once bore piles of canned goods to and fro now pushed by\nblue-faced men in khaki, held long stacks of pointed shells. In at one\nend of the building they came in ceaseless procession to pause before\nthe lead tanks where the workmen took each shell and dipped its tip\nbriefly in the lead, then returned it to the truck. Out the other end\nthey wheeled to be loaded in trucks, buses, limousines, everything that\nhad wheels and would move, to be rushed to the maw of the ceaselessly\ncrying guns.\n\nFor the offensive was on--the advance of the Lassans had been turned to\na retreat. Along the water's edge, with its back to the sea and the\nsteamers ready to pick up the survivors of the defeat of the last army\nof man, the last army of man had rallied; rallied and stood as the new\nlead-tipped shells began to come in and the artillery spouted them at\nthe Lassan fighting-machines, no longer invincible, invulnerable\nmonsters, but hittable and smashable pieces of mechanism.\n\nIt was Ben Ruby in a tank shining dully with the new lead plating who\nled the charge against the Lassan fighting machines on the first day of\nthe battle, and who, with his little division of American tanks, had\nencountered three of the huge Lassan monsters outside the city. For a\nmoment, as though dazed by the audacity of this attack, they had done\nnothing at all. Then all three had turned the light-rays on him. Would\nit hold?\n\nThe deadly rays glanced off, danced to the zenith in a shower of\ncoruscating sparks and the gun of the American tank spoke--once, twice.\nA round hole, with a radiating star-pattern running out from it,\nappeared in the nose of the nearest Lassan fighting-machine, and it sank\nto the earth like a tired animal, rolling over and over, helpless. The\nother two turned to flee, swinging their long bodies around. Surrounded\nby shell-bursts, riddled by the lead-tipped weapons they too, struggled\nand sank, to rise no more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that there had been losses, of course. The Lassan shells\noccasionally burst in the back areas and claimed a toll. But the advance\nhad gone on steadily for a whole day, unchecked; the Lassans were driven\nback.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as they had come, they disappeared. South African\naerial scouts, far ahead of the army, reported there was no sign of the\nenemy in the whole of New Jersey. The dodos vanished from the skies, the\nfighting machines from the earth. The Lassans seemed to have abandoned\nthe struggle and retired to their underground city to wait for the end.\n\n\"Frankly,\" said Sherman, \"I don't like it. Those johnnies are too smart\nto give up like that. I'll bet you a thousand dollars against a lead\nbullet that they've gone back there to figure out some surprise for us,\nand when it comes it's going to be a beaner. Those babies may be\nelephants to the eye, but there's nothing slow about their brains.\"\n\n\"General Grierson doesn't think so,\" said Ben Ruby. \"He's all ready to\nhang out the flags and call it a day. He sent home two more divisions of\ninfantry yesterday.\"\n\n\"General Grierson hasn't got the finest girl in the world locked up in\nthat hole under the Catskills, burning her fingers off,\" said Sherman\nwith a set face. \"Say, those babies aren't licked by a million miles.\nTheir guns are just as good as ours and that light stuff they put in\nthem is worse than powder when it goes off. They just didn't have as\nmany guns. I'm taking even money that when they come out again, they'll\nhave something that will make our artillery look sick.\"\n\nThey stood on a street-corner in Philadelphia, the new headquarters of\nthe army of the federated governments.\n\n\"Yes, but what are we going to do about it?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"A lot. For one thing we might go up there and try to bust in, but I\ndon't think that would be very hot. They'll be expecting it. What we can\ndo though, is get General Grierson to give us one of the laboratories\nhere in town and some men to help us, and dope out a few little presents\non our side of the fence. I learned plenty through those thought helmets\nof theirs while I was in that place, though I didn't realize I was\ngetting a lot of it at the time. Those helmets work both ways, you know,\nand they couldn't keep me from picking up some of their stuff,\nespecially as they were so anxious to find out what I knew they didn't\nwatch themselves.\"\n\n\"Nice idea,\" said Ben. \"I know a little about chemistry and between us\nwe might put over something good. Let's Go.\"\n\nAn hour later, they were installed in their own experimental laboratory,\njust off Market Street, with enough assistants to help them with routine\nwork and Gloria Rutherford and Murray Lee to keep them amused.\n\n\"All right, chief,\" said Ben, when they were installed. \"What do we do\nfirst?\"\n\n\"Figure out some kind of armor that will stand off whatever kind of ray\nthey pop up with, I guess,\" offered Sherman.\n\n\"May I stick my two cents in?\" said Murray Lee. \"I don't think that any\nkind of armor is going to do a lot of good. For one thing, you don't\nknow what the Lassans are going to produce. Those tanks we had were\narmored against the best kind of shells, and the Lassans turned up with\nthe light-ray that made them look like Swiss cheese. It's your show, but\nif I were fishing for something, it would be a way to sock those guys.\nIn this kind of war, the man that gets in the first punch is going to\nbeat.\"\n\n\"That light-ray of theirs is pretty good,\" said Ben. \"From what you know\nabout it already, you ought to be able to dope out a pretty good heat\nray.\"\n\n\"No soap,\" said Sherman. \"Too slow. They'll be all set for that, anyway.\nIt's right along the line they think. No, what we've got to have is\nsomething along a new line, and I'm thinking it can't be anything like a\ngun, either. They're onto that now.\" He closed the door to the inner\noffice with a bang.\n\n\"By the way,\" asked Gloria, \"why don't the Australians send some\nairplanes up there to the Catskills and shoot up the Lassan\nheadquarters?\"\n\n\"Didn't you know?\" asked Ben. \"They tried it. They dumped about a\nhundred tons of explosives all over the joint, and it might have been so\nmuch mud for all the good it did. Then they ran a railroad gun up there\nand tried to shell the door, but that wasn't any good, either. They've\ngot a signal station up there watching, waiting for them to come out,\nand we'll just have to wait for that. Sherman\"--he indicated the door\nbehind which the aviator had retired--\"is nearly bughouse. They've got\nhis girl a prisoner in there.\"\n\n\"Tough break,\" commented Gloria. \"Wish I could do something for the\nlady.\"\n\nThey talked about minor matters for a time, Ben speaking absently and\ncudgeling his brains for a line on which to work toward the new weapon.\nIt is not easy to sit down and plan out a new invention without anything\nto start on beyond the desire to have it.\n\nSuddenly, the inner door was flung open. In the aperture they saw\nSherman, his face grinning, a small piece of metal in his hand.\n\n\"I've got it, folks!\" he cried. \"A gravity beam!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThe Gravity Beam\n\n\n\"A gravity beam!\" they ejaculated together in tones varying from\nincredulity to simple puzzlement. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Well, it'll take quite a bit of explaining, but I'll drop out the\ntechnical part of it.... You see, it's like this--You remember old man\nEinstein, the frizzy-hair Frisian, demonstrated that magnetism and\ngravity are the same thing down underneath? And that some of the\nastronomers and physicists have said that both magnetism and light are\nthe same thing? That is, forms of vibration. Well, one of the things I\npicked up from the lads in this Lassan city was that light, matter,\nelectricity, gravitation, magnetism and the whole works, are the same\nthing in different forms.\n\n\"They've just jumped one step beyond Einstein. Now, they've got a way of\nproducing, or mining, pure light, that is, pure matter in its simplest\nform. When it's released from pressure it becomes material and raises\nhell all over the shop. How they get the squeeze on it, I can't say.\nAnyway, it isn't important.\"\n\n\"Very interesting lecture--very,\" commented Gloria, gravely.\n\n\"You pipe down and listen to your betters till they get through,\"\nSherman went on. \"Children should be seen, not heard. But what I've got\nhere is a piece of permalloy. Under certain magnetic conditions it\ndefies gravity. Now if we can screen gravity that way, why can't we\nconcentrate it, too?\"\n\n\"Why not? Except that nobody ever did it and nobody knows how,\" said Ben\nRuby.\n\n\"Well, here's the catch. We can do anything we want to with gravity if\nwe go about it right. What is it in chemical atoms that has weight? It's\nthe positive charge, isn't it? The nucleus. And it's balanced by the\nnegative charges, the electrons, that revolve around it. Now if we can\nfind a way to pull some of these negative charges loose from a certain\nnumber of atoms of a substance, there are going to be a whole lot of\npositive charges floating around without anything to bite on. And if we\ncan shoot them at something, it's going to have more positive charges\nthan it can stand. And when that happens, the something is going to get\nawful heavy, and there are going to be exchanges of negative charges\namong all the positive charges, and things are going to pop.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Ben. \"But what good does all this do? Give us the real\ndope on how you're going to do it.\"\n\n\"Well, with what I picked up from the Lassans, I think I know. They\nknow all about light and mechanics, but they're rotten chemists, and\ndon't realize how good a thing they've got in lots of ways. Now look--if\nyou throw a beam of radiations from a cathode tube into finely divided\nmaterial you break up some of the atoms. Well, all we have to do is get\nan extra-powerful cathode tube, break up a lot of atoms, and then\ndeliver the positive charges from them onto whatever we're going for.\nThat would be your gravity beam.\"\n\n\"How are you going to get radiation powerful enough to split up enough\natoms to do you any good?\" inquired Ben.\n\n\"Easy. Use a radium cathode. The Lassans have the stuff, but never think\nof using it seriously. They think it's an amusing by-product in their\npure light mines, and just play round with it. Nobody ever used it\nbefore on earth, because it was too expensive for such foolishness, but\nwith so many less people around, we can get some without too much\ntrouble, I guess.\"\n\n\"Mmm. Sounds possible,\" said Ben. \"That is, in theory. I'd like to see\nit work in practice. How are you going to throw this beam?\"\n\n\"Cinch. Down a beam of light. Light will conduct sound or radio waves\neven through a vacuum and this stuff I'm sending isn't so very\ndifferent. Whatever we hit will act as an amplifier and spread the\neffect through the whole body.\"\n\n\"Boy, you want to be careful you don't blow up the earth,\" said Murray\nLee. \"Well, Gloria, I guess we're indicated to go out and dig up some\nradium. Let's fool them by going before they ask us. There ought to be a\nsupply in some of the hospitals.\"\n\nThey rose and the other two plunged into an excited and highly technical\ndiscussion. When they returned, the workmen had already constructed a\nblack box, not unlike an enormous camera in shape, in the center of the\nfloor. At its back and attached to it, stood a stand fitted with a\nseries of enormous clamps. Ben and Sherman were at a bench, working\nblowpipes, and shaping the delicate, iridescent glass of a long tube\nwith a bulge at its center.\n\n\"Here you are,\" said Murray Lee. \"I had to row with the Surgeon-General\nof the Dutch Colonial contingent to get this. He wanted to use it on\nsome tuberculosis experiment. But I convinced him that he wouldn't be\nworrying about 't. b.' if the Lassans came out of their hole and stood\nthe army on its head. How goes the job?\"\n\n\"Swell,\" said Sherman. \"Now you children run along and play. We're busy.\nWe won't be finished with this thing before tomorrow afternoon, if\nthen.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact it was the next evening before Murray and Gloria\nwere summoned back to the laboratory. The device they had seen was now\nmounted on a stand of its own, with long ropes of electrical connections\nrunning back from it, and had been pushed back to the end of the room.\nOpposite it was another stand with a two-foot square piece of sheet iron\nresting on a chair in its center. The lens of the big camera was pointed\nin that direction.\n\n\"Now,\" said Sherman, \"watch your uncle and see what happens.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned a switch; the tube at the back of the apparatus lit up with a\nvivid violet glow and a low humming sound filled the room.\n\n\"I decided to use powdered lead in the box,\" he explained. \"It is the\nheaviest metal there is available, and gives us the largest number of\nnuclei to project.\"\n\nA second switch was thrown in and a beam of light leaped from the camera\nand struck in the center of the iron sheet, producing merely a mild\nwhite illumination.\n\n\"Poof!\" said Gloria. \"That isn't such a much. I could do that with a\nflashlight.\"\n\n\"Right you are. I haven't let her go yet. Hold your breath now.\"\n\nHe bent over, drove a plunger home. For just a second the only visible\neffect was a slight intensification of the beam of light. Then there was\na report like a thunder-clap; a dazzling ball of fire appeared on the\nstand; a cloud of smoke, and Murray and Gloria found themselves sitting\non the floor. The iron plate had completely vanished; so had the chair,\nall but two of its legs, which, lying in the center of the stand, were\nburning brightly. The acrid odor of nitrogen dioxide filled the room.\n\n\"Golly,\" said Ben Ruby, seizing a fire extinguisher from the wall and\nturning it on the blaze. \"That's even more than we expected. Look, it\nmade a hole right through the wall! We'll have to keep that thing tied\nup.\"\n\n\"I'll say you will,\" said Murray, helping Gloria up. \"It's as bad for\nthe guy that's using it as the one at the other end. But seriously,\nyou've got something good there. What happened to the iron plate?\"\n\n\"Disintegrated. Let's see, where does iron come in the periodic table,\nBen? Twenty-six? Then you'll probably find small quantities of all the\nchemical elements from twenty-five down in that heap of ashes. Phooey,\nwhat a rotten smell! That must be the action of the beam on the nitrogen\nin the air.\"\n\n\"There's a lot to be worked out in this thing, yet, though,\" declared\nBen, \"and if you're right about the Lassans making a comeback, precious\nlittle time in which to work it out. For one thing, we've got to get a\nsearchlight that will throw a narrow pencil of light for a long\ndistance. I don't think those elephant-men are going to let us poke this\nthing under their noses. And for another we've got to dope out something\nto keep it in and some way to furnish current for it....\"\n\n\"Can't you work it from a tank?\" asked Murray, \"and rig up a friction\naccumulator to work from the tracks?\"\n\n\"I can, but I don't like the idea,\" Sherman replied. \"From the way those\nLassans took to our airplanes, I could make a guess that when they come,\nthey're going to come in some kind of flying machine. The dodos are no\ngood in modern war. We'd never catch any kind of an airplane with a\ntank.\"\n\n\"How about an airplane for yourselves?\"\n\n\"Too unsteady and too frail. I want something that will take a few pokes\nand not fold up.\"\n\n\"Say, you guys have less ingenuity for a couple of inventors than anyone\nI ever heard of,\" Gloria put in. \"Why don't you get one of these\nAustralian rocket-planes and fix it up. It's big enough to hold all your\nfoolishness, and if this thing is half as powerful as it looks, you\nought to be able to harness it some way for a power-plant. Then you can\nplaster your rocket all over with armor. I think--\"\n\nSherman interrupted her by bringing his fist down on the table with a\nbang that made the glasses rattle.\n\n\"You've got it! By the nine gods of Clusium! With the punch this thing\ngives us used as a rocket, we'd have power enough to fly to the moon if\nwe wanted to. Why a rocket airplane at all? Why not a pure rocket? Let's\ngo.\"\n\nIt was another week before workmen, even toiling with all the\nmachine-shop facilities of Philadelphia at their disposal, and working\nday and night, could turn out the machine to Sherman's design, and it\nwas two more before the apparatus was installed. The trial trip was set\nfor the early morning when there would be least chance of atmospheric\ndisturbance.\n\nThe _Monitor_ (she had been named for the famous fighting craft with\nwhich the American navy ushered in a new age in the history of war) now\nstood near the center of the flying field at the Philadelphia airport--a\nlong, projectile-like vessel with gleaming metal sides, set with heavy\nwindows, ten feet in diameter and nearly twice as long. At her stern a\nfunnel-like opening led to the interior. This was the exhaust for the\npower-plant. At her bow the sharp nose was blunted off and its tip was\noccupied by the lens of a high-powered parabolic searchlight, slightly\nrecessed, and with the discharge tubes for the atomic nuclei arranged\naround its edge so they would be thrown directly into the light-beam as\nsoon as generated.\n\nAs the four approached her she had been placed on the ramp from which\nshe was to start, slanting slightly upward, with a buffer of timber and\nearth behind it, to take up the enormous recoil her power plant was\nexpected to develop.\n\n\"How do you get in?\" asked Gloria, walking around the _Monitor_ and\ndiscovering no sign of a door.\n\n\"Oh, that's a trick I borrowed from our friends the Lassans,\" explained\nSherman. \"Look here.\" He led her to a place half way along one side,\nwhere two almost imperceptible holes marred the shining brightness of\nthe new vessel's sides. \"Stick your fingers in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe did as directed, pressed, and a wide door in the side of the\nprojectile swung open. \"Bright thought. No handles to break off.\"\n\nThey stepped in, bending their heads to avoid the low ceiling.\n\n\"She isn't as roomy or comfortable or as heavily armored as the one I\nmean to build later,\" explained Sherman, \"but this is only an\nexperimental craft, built in a hurry, so I had to take what I could\nget.... Now here, Murray you sit here. Your job is going to be to mind\nthe gravity beam that furnishes us our power. Every time you get the\nsignal from me, you throw this power switch. That will turn on all three\nswitches at the stern, and shoot the gravity beam out for the\nexhaust.... You see, we can't expect to keep up a steady stream of\nexplosions with this kind of a machine. We wouldn't be able to control\nit. We'll travel in a series of short hops through the air, soaring\nbetween hops, like a glider.\"\n\n\"How are you going to do any soaring without wings?\" asked Murray.\n\n\"We have wings. They fold into the body at the back. I've made them\nautomatic. When the power switch is thrown the wings fold in; after the\nexplosion they come out automatically unless we disconnect them. If we\nwant to really go fast, we'll disconnect them and go through the air\nlike a projectile.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. Will the windows stand the gaff?\"\n\n\"I hope to tell you they will. I had them made of fused quartz, with an\nouter plating of leaded glass, just in case the Lassans try to get fresh\nwith that light-ray of theirs.\n\n\"Now, Gloria, you sit here. You're the best shot in the crowd, and it's\ngoing to be your job to run that searchlight in the prow. As soon as you\npick up anything with it, Ben will throw his switch, and whatever is at\nthe end of it will get a dose of pure protons. We'll have to do a good\ndeal of our aiming by turning the ship itself. I made the searchlight as\nflexible as I could, but I couldn't get a great deal of turn to it on\naccount of the necessity of getting the nuclei into the light beam.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" asked Murray. \"Won't this pure light armor of the Lassans\nknock your beam for a row of ashcans?\"\n\n\"I should say not! If they use it, we've got 'em. That stuff has weight\nand the minute this beam of ours hits it, it will intensify the effect,\nand no matter how much pressure they have on it, it will blow up all\nover the place.... All set? Let's go. Throw in your switch, Murray.\"\n\nMurray did as directed. There was a humming sound and the tiny beam of\nlight leaped across the rear end of the ship and out the exhaust. Across\nit fell a thin powder of iron filings--the material that was to be\ndecomposed to furnish the power.\n\nBang! With a roar, the _Monitor_ leaped forward, throwing all of them\nback into their heavily padded seats, then dipped and soared as the\nwings came into play. The passengers glanced through the windows.\nBeneath them the outskirts of Philadelphia were already speeding by.\n\n\"Say,\" said Ben, \"this is some bus. We must be making five hundred miles\nan hour.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Sherman. \"We could do over seven hundred as a pure\nprojectile, but we can't use that much speed and keep our maneuvering\npower.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe Coming of the Green Globes\n\n\n\"Where to, folks?\" asked Sherman, during one of their periods of\nsoaring, as they floated high above the hilly country to the west of the\nDelaware River.\n\n\"Oh, most anywhere,\" said Ben. \"I would like to see you try out this\nnew-fangled gun of yours on something, though.\"\n\n\"What shall we try it on? A house?\"\n\n\"No, that's too easy. We saw what it could do to things like that in the\nlaboratory. Find a nice rock.\"\n\n\"O. K. Here goes. Don't give her the gun for a minute, Murray.\"\n\nWith wings extended, the _Monitor_ spiralled down toward the crest of\nthe mountain. A projecting cliff stood just beneath them, sharply\noutlined in the rays of the morning sun.\n\n\"Now this is going to be difficult,\" warned Sherman. \"Throw that\nconnecting bar, Ben. It holds the power switch and the beam switch\ntogether so they're both turned on at once. Otherwise the recoil we'd\nget on this end of the beam would tumble us over backward. Hold it,\nwhile I set the controls. We've got to take a jump as soon as we fire,\nor we'll pop right into the mess we make.... Ready? All right, Gloria,\ngo ahead with your searchlight.\"\n\nThe beam of the searchlight shot out, pale in the daylight, wavered a\nsecond, then outlined the crest of the cliff.\n\n\"Shoot!\" cried Sherman.\n\nThere was a terrific report; a shock; the _Monitor_ leaped, quivering in\nevery part, and as they spiralled down to see what damage they had done,\nthey beheld no cliff at all, but a rounded cup at the tip of the\nmountain in which a mass of molten rock boiled and simmered.\n\n\"Fair enough,\" said Ben. \"I guess that will do for the Lassans, all\nright. Home, James?\"\n\n\"Right,\" answered Sherman. \"We've found out all we want to know this\ntrip.\"\n\nThe homeward journey was accomplished even more swiftly than the trip\nnorthward as Sherman gained in experience at the controls of the\nmachine. As it glided slowly to earth at the airport a little group of\nofficers was waiting to meet them.\n\n\"What in thunder have you been doing?\" one of them greeted the\nAmericans. \"Your static, or whatever it was you let loose, burned out\nall the tubes in half the army radio sets in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"By the nine gods of Clusium!\" said Sherman. \"I never thought of that.\nWe're reducing matter pretty much to its lowest terms, and it's all a\ngood deal alike on that scale--vibrations that may be electricity,\nmagnetism, light or matter. Of course, when we let go that shot there\nwas enough radiation to be picked up on Mars. I'll have to figure out a\nway to get around that. Those Lassans are no bums as electricians and\nafter we've been at them once or twice, they'll be able to pick up our\nradiation whenever we're coming and duck us.\"\n\n\"There's another thing,\" said Ben. \"I thought the _Monitor_ vibrated a\ngood deal when you let that shot go.\"\n\n\"It did. We'll have to get more rigidity or we'll be shaking ourselves\nto pieces every time we shoot. But this, as I said, is an experimental\nship. What we've got to do now is turn in and build a real one, with\nheavy armor and a lot of new tricks.\"\n\n\"How are you going to know what kind of armor to put on her?\"\n\n\"That's easy. Steel will keep out any kind of material projectiles\nthey're likely to have, if it's thick enough. It won't keep out the\nlight-ray, but we'll put on a thin lead plating to take care of that,\njust in case, though I don't think they're likely to try it after the\none failure.\n\n\"Then inside the steel armor, we'll put a vacuum chamber. That will stop\nanything but light and maybe cosmic radiation, and I don't think they're\nup to that, although we'll get a little of the effect through the struts\nthat support the outer wall of the chamber. What I would like though, is\na couple of these Lassan thought-helmets. Not that you people are slow\non the uptake, but we'd be a lot faster if we had them, and we're going\nto need all the speed we can get.\"\n\nThey were crossing the flying field as they spoke, making for\nheadquarters, where Sherman presently laid out the design for the second\n_Monitor_, embodying the improvements he had mentioned. The engineer who\nlooked it over smiled doubtfully.\n\n\"I don't think we can give this to you in less than three or four\nweeks,\" he said. \"It will take a lot of time to cast that armor you\nwant and to build the vacuum chamber. I assume your own workmen are\ngoing to make the internal fixtures.\"\n\n\"Correct from the word go,\" Sherman told him. \"But you better have it\nbefore three or four weeks are up. Ben, what do you say we run over to\nthe lab and see if we can dig up something new.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was two days later when they stood at headquarters on the flying\nfield again. The _Monitor_ had made three more trips, on one of them,\nflying over the Lassan city without seeing anything more important than\nthe Australian signal station perched on a nearby hill. Meanwhile the\narmy of the federated governments had pushed out its tentacles,\nsearching the barren waste that had been the most fruitful country in\nthe world. East, west, south and north the report was the same; no sign\nof the Lassans or any other living thing.\n\n\"I could wish,\" said Gloria, \"that those lads would stick their noses\nout. I'd like to try the _Monitor_ on them.\"\n\n\"You'll get all you want of that,\" said Ben a trifle grimly. \"I'm glad\nthey're giving us this much of a break. It lets us get things organized.\nSherman is monkeying with a light-power motor now. If he catches it, our\ntroubles will be over.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" called an officer at a desk, as a telegraph key\nbegan tapping. \"This looks like something.\" He translated the dots\nand dashes for them. \"Lassan--city--door--opening.... It's from the\nsignal station on that mountain right over it.... Big--ball--coming\nout--will--will--what's this? The message seems to end.\" He depressed\nthe key vigorously and then waited. It remained silent.\n\n\"Oh, boy,\" said Sherman, \"there she goes! They got that signal station,\nI'll bet a dollar to a ton of Lassan radiation.\"\n\nThe officer was hammering the key again. \"We're sending out airplane\nscouts now,\" he said. \"Too bad about the signal station, but that's\nwar!\"\n\n\"Come on, gang,\" said Ben. \"Let's get out to the flying field. Looks\nlike we're going to be in demand.\"\n\nIn a car borrowed from the headquarters staff they raced out to the\nfield where the _Monitor_ stood, ready on its ramp for any emergency.\nJust as they arrived an airplane became visible, approaching from the\nnorth. It circled the field almost as though the pilot were afraid to\nland, then dipped and came to a slow and hesitating stop. The onlookers\nnoticed that its guy wires were sagging, its wheels uneven; it looked\nlike a wreck of a machine which had not been flown for ten years, after\nit had lain in some hangar where it received no attention at all.\n\nAs they ran across the field toward it, the pilot climbed slowly out.\nThey noticed that his face was pale and horror-struck, his limbs\nshaking.\n\n\"All gone,\" he cried to the oncoming group.\n\n\"What? Who? What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Everything. Guns. Tanks. Airplanes. The big ball's got 'em. Almost\ngot--\" and he collapsed in Ben's arms in a dead faint.\n\n\"Here,\" said Ben, handing the unconscious aviator to one of the\nAustralian officers. \"Come on. There's something doing up there. Big\nballs, eh? Well, we'll make footballs of 'em. That chap looks as though\nhe'd been through a milling machine, though. The Lassans certainly must\nhave something good.\"\n\nWith a shattering crash as Murray Lee gave her all the acceleration she\nwould take, the _Monitor_ left the ramp, soared once or twice to gain\naltitude, and headed north amid a chorus of explosions. In less than ten\nminutes the thickly-settled districts of northern New Jersey were\nflowing past beneath them.\n\n\"Wish we had some radio in this bus,\" remarked Ben Ruby. \"We could keep\nin touch with what's going on.\"\n\n\"It would be convenient,\" said Sherman, \"but you can't have everything.\nThe Lassans aren't going to wait for us to work out all our problems....\nLook--what's that over there?\"\n\nAt nearly the same level as themselves and directly over the city of\nNewark a huge globular object, not unlike an enormous green cantaloupe,\nappeared to float in the air. From its under side the thin blue beam of\nsome kind of ray reached to the ground. From the face turned diagonally\naway from them a paler, wider beam, yellowish in color, reached down\ntoward the buildings of the city. And where it fell on them, they\ncollapsed into shattering ruin; roof piled on walls, chimneys tumbled to\nthe ground. There was no flame, no smoke, no sound--just that sinister\nmonster moving slowly along, demolishing the city of Newark almost as\nthough it were by an effort of thought.\n\n\"Hold tight, everybody,\" cried Sherman. \"Going up.\"\n\nThe _Monitor_ slanted skyward. Through the heavy quartz of her windows\nthey could see a battery of field guns, cleverly concealed behind some\ntrees in the outskirts of the city, open fire. At the first bursts the\nmonster globe swung slowly round, the pale yellow ray cutting a swath of\ndestruction as it moved. The shells of the second burst struck all\naround and on it. \"Oh, good shooting,\" said Gloria, but even as she\nspoke the yellow ray bore down like a fate and the guns became silent.\n\n\"What have they got?\" she shouted between the bursts of the _Monitor's_\nrocket motor.\n\n\"Don't know,\" replied Sherman, \"but it's good. Ready? Here goes. Cut\noff, Murray.\"\n\nFrom an altitude of 15,000 feet the _Monitor_ swept down in a long\ncurve. As she dived Gloria swung the searchlight beam toward the green\nglobe.\n\n\"Go!\" shouted Sherman, and Ben threw the switch. There was a terrific\nexplosion, the _Monitor_ pitched wildly, then, under control swung round\nand began to climb again. Through the thinning cloud of yellow smoke,\nthey could see a long black scar across the globe's top, with lines\nrunning out from it, like the wrinkles on an old, old face.\n\n\"Damn!\" said Sherman. \"Only nicked him. They must have something good\nin the line of armor on that thing. Look how it stood up. Watch it,\neverybody, we're going to go again, Gloria!\"\n\nAgain the searchlight beam swung out and down, sought the green monster.\nBut this time the Lassan globe acted more quickly. The yellow ray\nlifted, probed for them, caught them in its beam. Instantly, the\noccupants of the _Monitor_ felt a racking pain in every joint; the\ncamera-boxes of the gravity-beam trembled in their racks, the windows,\nset in solid steel though they were, shook in their frames, the whole\nbody of the rocket-ship seemed about to fall apart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDesperately Sherman strove with the controls; dived, dodged, then\nfinally, with a raised hand to warn the rest, side-slipped and tumbled\ntoward the earth, pulling out in a swinging curve with all power on--a\ncurve that carried them a good ten miles away before the yellow ray\ncould find them.\n\n\"Boy!\" said Murray Lee, feeling of himself. \"I feel as though every\njoint in my body were loose. What was that, anyway?\"\n\n\"Infra-sound,\" replied Sherman. \"You can't hear it, but it gets you just\nthe same. Like a violinist and a glass. He can break it if he hits the\nright note. I told you those babies would get something hot. They must\nhave found a way to turn that pure light of theirs into pure sound and\nvibrate it on every note of the scale all at once, beside a lot the\nscale never heard of. Well, now we know.\"\n\n\"And so do they,\" said Ben. \"That bozo isn't going to hang around and\ntake another chance on getting mashed with our gravity beam. Even if we\ndid only tip him, I'll bet we hurt him plenty.\"\n\n\"All I've got to say,\" replied Sherman, \"is that I'm glad we're made of\nmetal instead of flesh and blood. If that infra-sound ray had hit us\nbefore, we'd be mashed potatoes in that field down there. No wonder the\nsignal station went out so quick.\"\n\n\"Do we go back and take another whack at them?\" asked Murray Lee.\n\n\"I don't like to do it with this ship,\" Sherman replied. \"If we had the\n_Monitor II_ it would be easy. With that extra vacuum chamber around\nher, she'll take quite a lot of that infra-sound racket. Vacuum doesn't\nconduct sound you know, though we'd get some of it through the struts.\nBut this one--. Still I suppose we'll have to show them we mean\nbusiness.\"\n\nThe _Monitor_ turned, pointed her lean prow back toward Newark, and bore\ndown. In their flight from the infra-sound ray the Americans had dived\nbehind a fluffy mass of low-hanging cloud; now they emerged from it,\nthey could see the huge green ball, far up the river, retreating at its\nbest speed.\n\n\"Aha,\" Sherman said. \"He doesn't like gravity beams on the coco. Well,\ncome on, giddyap horsey. Give her the gun, Murray.\"\n\nUnder the tremendous urge of the gravity-beam explosions at her tail,\nthe _Monitor_ shot skyward, leaving a trail of orange puffs in her wake\nas the beam decomposed the air where it struck it. Sherman lifted her\nbehind the clouds, held the course for a moment, called \"Ready, Gloria?\"\nand then dropped.\n\nLike a swooping hawk, the _Monitor_ plunged from her hiding place.\nSherman had guessed aright. The green ball was not five miles ahead of\nthem, swinging over the summits of the Catskills to reach its home. As\nthey plunged down the yellow ray came on, stabbed quickly, once, twice,\nthrice--caught them for a brief second of agonizing vibration, then lost\nthem again as Sherman twisted the _Monitor_ round. Then Gloria's beam\nstruck the huge globule fair and square, Ben Ruby threw the switch, and\na terrific burst of orange flame swallowed the whole center of the\nLassan monster.\n\nPrepared though they were for the shock, the force of the explosion\nthrew the ship out of control. It gyrated frantically, spinning up, down\nand sidewise, as Sherman worked the stick. The Catskills reared up at\nthem; shot past in a whirl of greenery; then with a splash they struck\nthe surface of the Hudson.\n\nFortunately, the _Monitor's_ wings were extended, and took up most of\nthe shock at the cost of being shattered against her sides. Through the\nbeam-hole at the stern the water began to flow into the interior of the\nship. \"Give her the gun!\" called Sherman frantically, working his\nuseless controls. There was a report, a shock, a vivid cloud of steam,\nand dripping and coughing like a child that has swallowed water in\nhaste, the _Monitor_ rose from the stream, her broken wings trailing\nbehind her.\n\n\"I don't know--whether--I can fly--this crate or not,\" said Sherman,\ntrying to make what was left of the controls work. \"Shoot, Murray--if we\nput on enough power--we won't have to soar.\" There was a renewed roar of\nexplosions from the _Monitor_. Desperately, swinging in a wide curve\nthat carried her miles out of her way, she turned her nose southwards.\n\n\"Make Philly,\" cried Sherman cryptically, above the sound of the\nexplosions that were driving their craft through the air at over six\nhundred miles an hour. Almost as he said it, they saw the airport\nbeneath them. The _Monitor_ swerved erratically; the explosions ceased;\nshe dived, plunged and slithered to a racking stop across the foreshore\nof the seaplane port, ending up with a crash against a float, and\npitched all four occupants from their seats onto the floor.\n\n\"Well, that's one for you and one for me,\" said Sherman as he surveyed\nthe wreckage ruefully. \"We used up that green ball all right, but the\nold _Monitor_ will never pop another one. Did anyone notice whether\nthere were any pieces left, by the way?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Gloria. \"As we came up out of the water I could see a few\nhunks lying around on the hill.\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" remarked Sherman, \"they must be built pretty solid. Wish I knew\nwhat was in them; that's one thing I never did get through that\nthought-helmet. Probably something they just figured out. You gave her\nall the power we had, didn't you?\"\n\n\"There's something else I'd like to know,\" said Ben. \"And that's whether\nthey had time to warn the rest of the Lassans what they were up against.\nIf they did, we stand a chance. The way I have these guys figured is\nthat they're good, but they have a yellow streak, or maybe they're just\nlazy, and they don't like to fight unless they're sure of winning. If\nI'm right we'll have time to get _Monitor II_ into commission and before\nthey come out again, we'll be ready for them. If I'm wrong we might as\nwell find a nice hole somewhere and pull it in after us.\"\n\n\"Yes, and on the other hand, if they did have time to warn them, they'll\nsit down and dope out some new trick. Though I have a hunch they won't\nfind an answer to that gravity-beam so easily. There isn't any that I\nknow of.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" said Murray Lee, \"nothing to do till tomorrow. What are\nyou two rummies up to now?\"\n\n\"Run up and push them along on _Monitor II_ if we can,\" replied Ben. \"I\nthink I'll round up the rest of the mechanical Americans and put you all\nto work on it. We can work day and night and get it done a lot\nquicker.\"\n\n\"Me,\" said Sherman, \"I'm going to figure out some way to install radio\non that new bus or bust a button. That's one thing we ought not to do\nwithout. If we'd known the position of that green lemon before we saw\nit, we could have dived out of the clouds on it and made it the first\nshot before we got all racked up with that yellow ray.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nReinforcements\n\n\nThe little group separated, going about their several tasks. From\nwhatever cause, Ben proved to be right about the Lassan green spheres.\nAfter that one brief incursion, in which they had wrecked the greater\npart of Newark and most of the artillery the Australians had established\nto bear on the door of the Lassan city, they seemed to have returned to\ntheir underground home, realizing that the earth-men still had weapons\nthe equal of anything the creatures of Rigel could produce.\n\nFor a whole week there was no sign of them. Meanwhile, the federated\narmy dug itself in and prepared for the attack that was now believed\ncertain. The success of the first _Monitor_ had been great enough, it\nwas decided to warrant the construction of more than one of the second\nedition. General Grierson wished to turn the whole resource of the\nAllied armies to building an enormous number, but under Ben's persuasion\nhe consented to concentrate on only five.\n\nFor, as Ben pointed out to the general, the training of flesh and blood\nmen for these craft would be labor lost.\n\n\"They couldn't stand the acceleration that will be necessary, for one\nthing. With _Monitor II_ we expect to be able to work up swiftly to over\na thousand miles an hour, and the most acceleration a flesh and blood\nman can stand won't give us that speed quickly enough. Of course, we\ncould make 'em so they worked up speed slowly, but then they wouldn't be\nable to cut down fast enough to maneuver. And for another thing this\ninfra-sound ray the Lassans project would kill a flesh-and-blood man the\nfirst time it hit him. What we need for this kind of war, is supermen in\nthe physical sense. I don't want to make any such snooty statement as\nthat Americans are better than other people, but we happen to be the\nonly ones who have undergone this mechanical operation and we're the\nonly people in the world who can stand the gaff. You'll just have to let\nus make out the best we can. In fact, it might be better for you to\nre-embark the army and leave us to fight it out all alone. The more\nwomen we have here, the more we'll have to protect.\"\n\nThe general had been forced to agree to the first part of this\nstatement, but he gallantly refused to abandon the Americans, though he\ndid send away men, troops and guns which had become useless in this new\nbrand of warfare. But he insisted on retaining a force to run the\nfactories that supplied the Americans with their materials and on\npersonally remaining with it.\n\nEven as it stood, there were only fourteen of the mechanical Americans\nremaining--enough to man three of the Monitors.\n\nBut one day, as _Monitor II_, shining with newness, stood on her ramp\nhaving the searchlights installed, Herbert Sherman came dashing across\nthe flying field, waving a sheet of paper.\n\n\"I've got it,\" he cried, \"I've got it! I knew I got something from those\nLassans about electricity that I hadn't known before, and now I know\nwhat it is. Look!\"\n\n\"Radio?\" queried Ben.\n\n\"No, read it,\" said Sherman. \"Radio's out. But this is a thousand times\nbetter.\"\n\nHe extended the sheet to Ben, who examined the maze of figures gravely\nfor a moment.\n\n\"Now suppose you interpret,\" he said. \"I can't read Chinese.\"\n\n\"Sap. This is the formula for the electrical device I was talking\nabout.\"\n\n\"Yeh. Well, go on, spill it.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose I'll have to explain so even your limited intelligence\nwill grasp the point.... In our black box, we've been breaking up the\natoms of lead into positive and negative charges. We've been using the\npositive, and then just turning the negative loose. This thing will make\nuse of both, and give us a swell new weapon all at once.\n\n\"Look--the negative charges will do for our gravity beam just as well as\nthe positive. They will create an excess of negative electrons instead\nof an excess of positive protons in the object we hit, and cause atomic\ndisintegration. It's a gravity process just the same, but a different\none. Now that gives us something else to do with the positives.\n\n\"You know what a Leyden jar is? One of those things you charge with\nelectricity, then you touch the tip, and bang, you get a shock. Well,\nthis arrangement will make a super-Leyden jar of the _Monitor_. Every\ntime she fires the gravity-beam, the positive charges will be put into\nher hull, and she'll soon be able to load up with a charge that will\nknock your eye out when it's let loose.\"\n\n\"How's that? I know the outside of the _Monitor_ is covered with lead\nand so is the outside of a Leyden jar, but what's the connection?\"\n\n\"Well, it's this way. When you load up a Leyden jar the charge is not\nlocated in the plating, but in the glass. Now the _Monitor_ has a lot of\nsteel, which will take up the charge just as well as glass. As soon as\nshe fires the gravity-beam, these filaments will load her up with the\nleft-over positives till she grunts. See?\"\n\n\"And since the earth is building up a lot of negative potential all the\ntime, all you have to do is get your bird between you and the earth and\nthen let go at him?\"\n\n\"That's the idea. It'll make an enormous spark-gap, and whatever is\nbetween us and the earth will get the spark. Sock them with a flash of\nartificial lightning. We'll use the light-beam as a conductor just as\nwith the gravity-beam.\"\n\n\"Sounds good, but I want to see the wheels go round. How much of a\npotential do you think you can build up in the _Monitor_?\"\n\n\"Well, let's see. We've got two thicknesses of nine-inch steel ... volts\nto a cubic inch ... by cubic inches.... Holy smoke, look how this\nfigures out--over eleven million volts! That's theory, of course.\nThere'll be some leakage in practice and we won't have time to build up\nthat much negative potential every time we shoot, but if we only do half\nthat well, we'll have a pretty thorough-going charge of lightning ...\nPeterson, come over here. I want you to make some changes on this\nbarge.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Monitor II_ stood on the ramp that had once held her elder sister, her\nouter coating of lead glimmering dully in the morning sun. Here and\nthere, along her shining sides, were placed the windows through which\nher crew would watch the progress of the battle. Her prow was occupied\nby the same type of searchlight the earlier _Monitor_ had borne. But\nthis time the searchlight was surrounded by a hedge of shining silver\npoints--the discharge mechanism for the lightning flash. At the stern,\ninstead of the opening running right through into the ship, was a tight\nbulkhead, with the connections for the gravity-beam rocket-mechanism\nleading through it. As Sherman had pointed out, \"If this lightning is\ngoing to do us any good, we've got to get above our opponent, and those\nLassans have built machines that made interplanetary voyages. We've got\nto make this boat air-tight so that we can go right after them as far as\nRigel if necessary.\"\n\nIt had been decided, in view of the other monitors that were building,\nto make the trial trip of the second rocket-cruiser also a training\nvoyage, with Beeville and Yoshio replacing Murray Lee and Gloria in her\ncrew. They climbed in; the spectators stood back, and with a thunderous\nrush of explosions and a cloud of yellow gas, the second _Monitor_\nplunged into the blue.\n\n\"Where shall we go?\" asked Sherman, as the ship swooped over the plains\nof New Jersey.\n\n\"How much speed is she making?\" asked Ben Ruby.\n\n\"I don't know exactly. We didn't have time to invent and install a\nreliable speed gauge. But--\" he glanced at the map before him, then down\nthrough the windows at the surrounding country. \"I should say not far\nshort of eight hundred an hour. That improved box sure steps up the\nspeed. I'm not giving her all she'll stand, even yet.\"\n\n\"If you've got that much speed, why don't you visit Chicago?\" asked\nBeeville. \"The Australians have only pushed out as far as Ohio and there\nmay be some people there.\"\n\n\"Bright thought,\" remarked Sherman, swinging the prow of the vessel\nwestward. \"No telling what we'll find, but it's worth a look, anyway.\"\n\nFor some time there was silence in the cabin as the rocket-ship, with\nalternate roar and swoop, pushed along. Yoshio was the first to speak:\n\n\"Ah, gentlemen,\" he remarked, \"I observe beneath window trace of city of\nbeer, formerly Cincinnati.\"\n\n\"Sure enough,\" said Ben, peering down. \"There doesn't seem to be much\nbeer there now, though.\"\n\nThe white city of the Ohio vanished beneath them, silent and deserted,\nno sign of motion in its dead streets.\n\n\"You know,\" said Sherman, \"sometimes when I see these cities and think\nof all the Lassans have wrecked, it gives me an ache. I think I'd do\nalmost anything to knock them out. What right did they have to come to\nthis country or this earth, anyway? We were letting them alone.\"\n\n\"Same right wolf obtains when hungry,\" said Yoshio. \"Wolf is larger than\nrabbit--end of rabbit.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" agreed Beeville. \"They were the strongest. It's a case of hit\nor be hit in this universe. Our only out is to give them better than\nthey give us.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Ben Ruby, \"it may be a good thing for the old\nworld at that. You never heard of all the governments of the world\ncooperating before as they are now did you? There are still people alive\nyou know. Civilization hasn't been killed off by a long shot. And the\nlousy blue coloring that affected all the people who didn't get\nmetallized isn't going to be permanent. The babies that are being born\nthere now are normal, I hear. In a few generations the earth will be\nback to where it was, except for us. I don't know of any way to reverse\nthis metal evolution.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" said Beeville, \"unless we can get another dose of the\n'substance of life' as the Lassans call it, and we won't get that\nunless they decide to leave the earth in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Sherman, \"there's Chicago now. But what's that? No, there,\nalong the lake front.\"\n\nFollowing the direction of his pointing finger they saw something moving\nvaguely along Lake Shore Boulevard; something that might be a car--or a\nman!\n\n\"Let's go down and see,\" offered Ben.\n\n\"O. K. chief, but we've got to pick a good landing place for this tub. I\ndon't want to get her marooned in Chicago.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe explosions were cut off, the wings extended, and Sherman spiralled\ncarefully downward to the spot where they had seen the moving object.\nWith the nicety of a magician, he brought the ship to a gliding stop\nalong the park grass, and followed by the rest, Ben Ruby leaped out. The\nedge of the drive was a few yards away. As they emerged from the ship no\none was visible, but as they walked across the grass, a figure, metallic\nlike themselves, and with a gun in one hand, stepped from behind a tree.\n\n\"Stand back!\" it warned suspiciously. \"Who are you and what do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"Conversation with sweet-looking gentleman,\" said Yoshio politely, with\na bow.\n\n\"Why, we're members of the American air force,\" said Ben, \"cooperating\nwith the federated armies against the Lassans, and we were on an\nexploring expedition to see if we could find any more Americans.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the figure, with evident relief. \"All right, then. Come on\nout, boys.\"\n\nFrom behind other trees in the little park, a group of metallic figures,\nall armed, rose into sight.\n\n\"My name's Ben Ruby,\" said Ben, extending his hand, \"at present General\ncommanding what there is of the American army.\"\n\n\"Mine's Salsinger. I suppose you could call me Mayor of Chicago since\nthose birds got Lindstrom. So you're fighting the Lassans, eh? Good.\nWe'd like to take a few pokes at them ourselves, but that light-ray they\nhave is too much for us. All we can do is pot the birds.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Ben, \"we've got that beat and a lot of other stuff, too. How\nmany of you are there?\"\n\n\"Eight, including Jones, who isn't here now. Where are you from, anyway?\nSt. Louis?\"\n\n\"No, New York. Is anybody alive in St. Louis or the other western\ncities?\"\n\n\"There was. We had one man here from St. Paul, and Gresham was from St.\nLouis. The birds got him and carried him off to the joint the Lassans\nhave in the Black Hills, but he got away.\"\n\n\"Have they a headquarters in the Black Hills, too? They have one in the\nCatskills. That's where we've been fighting them.\"\n\nThe explanations went on. It appeared that Chicago, St. Louis and other\nwestern cities had been overwhelmed as had New York--the same rush of\nlight from the great comet, the same unconsciousness on every side, the\nsame awakening and final gathering together of the few individuals who\nhad been fortunate enough to attract the attentions of the Lassans'\nbirds and so be sent to their cities for transformation into robots.\n\nSince that time the birds had raided Chicago and the other western\ncities unceasingly, and had reduced the original company of some\nthirty-odd to the eight individuals whom Ben had encountered. Before the\nbirds had attacked them, however, they had managed to get a telegraph\nwire in operation and learn that people were alive at Los\nAngeles--whether mechanized or not they were uncertain, but they thought\nnot.\n\nOnce, several weeks before, a Lassan fighting-machine had passed through\nthe city, wrecked a few buildings with the light-ray, and disappeared\nwestward as rapidly as it had come.\n\nWith some difficulty and a good deal of crowding the eight Chicagoans\nwere gotten into the _Monitor II_ for the return journey. They were a\nmost welcome reinforcement and would furnish enough Americans to man all\nfive of the extra rocket-cruisers.\n\n\"I hope,\" remarked Sherman, a couple of days later, \"that those Lassans\ndon't come out quite yet, now. We've got the ships to meet them now, but\nthe personnel isn't as well trained as I should like. Salsinger nearly\nsmashed up one of the ships yesterday making his landing and one of the\nwings on another cracked up this morning when Roberts tried to turn too\nshort. These rocket-ships are so fast you need a whole state to handle\nthem in.\"\n\n\"And I,\" replied Ben Ruby, \"hope they come out damn soon. As you say,\nwe've got the ships now, but they're not so slow themselves, and with\nthe building methods they have, they can turn out ships faster than we\ncan.\"\n\n\"All the same, I'd like a few days more,\" Sherman countered. \"In this\nbrand of war it isn't how much you've got, but what you've got that\ncounts. Look at all the Australians--half a million men, and the only\ngood they are is to work in factories.\"\n\n\"Can't blame them for not being made of metal like us,\" said Ben.\n\"They're doing their best and we wouldn't be here but for them. Grierson\nis having the shops build us another ten rocket-cruisers, on the chance\nthat we pick up some reinforcements somewhere in the west.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Sherman, \"and I have another idea. I think we ought to keep\nat least one monitor on patrol over the Lassan city all the time.\nThey're apt to get out and sneak one over on us. She can stay high up,\nnear the edge of the atmosphere. Of course, she can't radio, but she can\nfire a couple of shots if she sights them coming out, and we can make a\nstatic detector that will register the disturbance. Then we can catch\nthem as fast as they come out, when they'll be easiest to attack.\"\n\n\"How about the other Lassan city out in the Black Hills?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"Would be bad strategy to try to handle them both at once, wouldn't it,\"\nsaid Sherman, \"Still, if you think so ...\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThe Great Conflict\n\n\nIt was _Monitor VII_, manned by the Chicagoans, which had the honor of\nsighting the enemy. Just as the twilight of a bright May day was closing\ndown over the radio men at the Philadelphia airport, the static detector\nmarked an unusual disturbance, then two quick shocks, which must have\ncome from the patrol's bow beam. In quick succession, the other five,\nstanding ready on their starting ramps, took in their crews, and roared\nup and away in a torrent of explosions at a thousand miles an hour.\n\nSoaring to fifty thousand feet above the earth, the squadron of\nrocket-ships made its way north, _Monitor II_ in the lead.\n\n\"Well, here we go,\" called Gloria, gaily, from her seat behind the\nsearchlight. \"Hope they don't give us the run-around this time.\"\n\n\"They won't have the chance,\" said Ben. \"That is, provided those\nChicago boys have sense enough to remember their instructions and let\nthem alone till we all get there. With six of these ships we ought to be\nable to rough 'em up a little bit.\"\n\nAt a speed of over a thousand miles an hour, thanks to the thinness of\nthe atmosphere through which they were traveling, it was only a few\nminutes' hop from Philadelphia to the Catskill city of the elephant-men.\nBen had hardly finished speaking before Sherman called from the control\nseat, \"There they are!\"\n\nFar beneath, half revealed, half-hidden by the few tiny clouds of fleece\nthat hung at the lower altitudes, they could see the naked scar in the\nhills that marked the Lassan headquarters. Around it floated half a\ndozen of the huge green balls they had encountered on the last occasion.\nAs they swept by, another one, looking like a grape at the immense\ndistance, trundled slowly out from the enormous door, swung to and fro\nfor a second or two and then swam up to join those already in the sky.\n_Monitor VII_ was to the north and above them--as she perceived the\nAmerican fleet she swept down to join the formation, falling into her\nprearranged place.\n\n\"Do we go now?\" asked Sherman.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Ben. \"Give them all a chance to get out. The more the\nmerrier. I'd like to finish the job this time. We can't get in that\ndoor, and if we did the rocket-ships would be no use to us in those\npassages, and they're the best we've got. Besides they're playing snooty\ntoo, and aren't paying a bit of attention to us. I hope they intend to\nfight it out to a finish this time.\"\n\nThey turned north, giving the Lassans time to assemble their fleet.\n\"What's the arrangement?\" asked Gloria. \"Do we all go for them at once?\"\n\n\"No. We dive in first and the rest follow behind, pulling up before they\nget in range. If anything happens to us, they'll rescue us--if they can.\nYou see we don't know what they've got any more than they know what\nwe've got, and I thought it would be a good idea to try the first attack\nwith only one ship. In a pinch the rest can get away--if the Lassans\nhaven't developed a lot of speed on those green eggs of theirs.\"\n\n\"How many now?\" asked Sherman, from the controls, as the squadron swung\nback southward and the scarred mountain swam over the horizon again.\n\n\"Two--five--nine--eleven--oh, I can't count them all,\" said Gloria,\n\"they keep changing formation so. There's a lot of them and they're\ncoming up toward us, but slowly. They haven't got that blue beam at the\nbase any more, either--you know the one that globe we got after was\nriding on.\"\n\nAs they approached it was indeed evident that the green globes were\nrising slowly through the twilight in some kind of loose formation. It\nwas too complex for the American observers to follow in the brief\nglimpses they were vouchsafed as they swept past at hurricane speed.\nThere seemed to be dozens of the Lassan globes; as though they expected\nto overwhelm opposition by mere force of numbers. Nearer and nearer came\nthe rocket-ships, nearer and nearer loomed the sinister Lassan globes,\nbetraying no signs of life, silent and ominous.\n\n\"Go?\" called Sherman from his seat at the controls.\n\n\"Go!\" said Ben.\n\nThe _Monitor II_ dived; and as she dived, Gloria Rutherford switched on\nthe deadly beam of the searchlight which would carry the gravity-beam\nagainst their enemies. For a moment it sought the green globes; then\ncaught one fairly. Ben Ruby threw the switch; and down the light beam\nleaped the terrible stream of the broken atoms like a wave of death.\nLeaped--and failed!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor as it struck the green globe, instead of the rending explosion and\nthe succeeding collapse, there came only a bright handful of stars, a\ncoruscating display of white fire that dashed itself around the Lassan\nship like foam on some coast-rock. It reeled backward, driven from its\nposition under the tremendous shock of the sundered atoms, but it\nremained intact.\n\n\"Well, I'm a son-of-a-gun!\" declared Sherman, as he put the _Monitor_\ninto a spiral climb at nine hundred miles an hour to avoid any\ncounter-attack. \"If they haven't found a gravity screen! I didn't think\nit was possible. Goes to show you you never can tell, especially with\nLassans. Look out folks, here comes the gaff, I'm going to loop!\"\n\nFor as he spoke the formation of green globes had opened out--swiftly by\nordinary standards, though slowly in comparison with the frantic speed\nof the American rocket-vessel. From half a dozen of them the racking\nyellow ray of infra-sound leaped forth to seek the audacious ship that\nhad attacked them single-handed. All round her they stabbed the\natmosphere, striking the few clouds and driving them apart in a fine\nspray of rain, but missing the _Monitor_ as she twisted and heaved at\nfrantic speed.\n\nTwenty miles away and high in the air they pulled up to recover\nthemselves.\n\n\"And _that_,\" Sherman went on with his interrupted observation,\n\"explains why they aren't using those blue beams for support any more.\nOf course a gravity screen that would work against our beam would work\nagainst the gravity of the earth just as well. They must have some way\nof varying its effect, though. They aren't rising very fast and haven't\ngot much speed.\"\n\n\"Probably the Lassans can't stand the acceleration,\" suggested Murray.\n\n\"Probably you're right. They can't have less than one Lassan in each\nglobe.... Of course, they might control them by radio, with the\nthought-helmets and have the crews all robots, but that wouldn't be a\nLassan way of doing things. And I doubt if they'd think radio safe,\nanyhow, even if they know about it, of which I'm not sure. We're\nshedding any amount of static around, and would play merry hell with\nmost any radio. Wish I knew how they worked that gravity screen, though.\nI'll bet a boat-load of Monitors against a thought-helmet that it's\nmagnetic.\"\n\n\"Wish we had some way to signal the rest of the fleet,\" said Ben, as\nthey swung into their position at the head of the formation again. \"I\ndon't want them pushing in there with the gravity-beam if it isn't going\nto do any good.\"\n\nMurray laughed. \"They'll find it out soon enough. I think we've got\nplenty speed to beat those infra-sound rays, too. If that's as strong as\nthey come, we've got 'em licked.\"\n\n\"Don't crow yet, boy friend,\" said Gloria. \"You don't know what those\nbabies have up their sleeves--excuse me, their trunks.\"\n\nAs the American fleet formed for a mass attack, the Lassan globes had\nbeen rising, and now they were a bare five thousand feet below the\nrocket-cruisers, swinging along at a height of 25,000 feet above the\nearth in the last rays of the setting sun. As the green globes rose they\ntook their places in a formation like an enormous crescent, the ends of\nwhich were extended as each new globe came up to join it.\n\n\"Looks like they want to get us in the middle and pop us from all\ndirections at once,\" observed Sherman. \"Well, here goes. Pick the end of\nthe line; that's our best chance. How's your potential, Gloria?\"\n\n\"O. K., chief,\" she answered. \"Lightning this time?\"\n\nHe nodded. The rockets of the _Monitor II_ roared; its prow dipped\nforward, and at an incredible speed it swept down on the line of Lassan\nwarships, followed by the rest of the American fleet. But it was no\nsurprise this time. As the monitors plunged in, from every green globe\nthat could bring them to bear, the long yellow rays shot forth. Right\nthrough them the _Monitor II_ plunged; the grate of it, even through\ntheir double coating of armor and the vacuum chambers, set their teeth\non edge; then the rocket-ship was pointing directly down at one of the\nLassans and Gloria snapped the key that released the artificial\nlightning.\n\nA jagged beam of flame, intenser than the hottest furnace, leaped\nthrough the air, struck the green globe, and sought the earth in a\nthousand tiny rivulets of light. For just a second the globe seemed\nunharmed; then slowly, and almost majestically, it began to dissolve in\nmid-air, spouting flames at every pore. Fully ten miles down and beyond,\nthe _Monitor_ turned again, and not till then did the sound of the\nexplosion reach them, a terrific, rending thunder-clap.\n\n\"See that?\" cried Sherman. \"That formation of theirs isn't so dumb.\nThey've got it all ranged out; none of our ships can get at them without\ncoming through at least one of those yellow rays, and if we stay in them\ntoo long--blooie!\"\n\nThey peered through the windows at the formation. Off at one side, they\ncould make out the forms of two more rocket-ships, outlined against the\nsky, while behind and above them pursued by the searching yellow beams,\ncame the rest. As they turned, they saw the gravity-beam shoot from one\nof the American ships, crumple uselessly against a green globe. Then\nthey plunged in, again, firing the gravity beam earthward to work up the\npotential for another lightning discharge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hills below rocked and roared to the repeated shock. Trees fell in\ncrashing ruin as lightning-bolt or infra-sound shivered them to bits;\ngreat cars of burned earth and molten rock marked the spots where the\ngravity-beam struck the ground. All round was a maze of yellow rays,\nlightning flashes, and green globes that reeled, rose, fell, sometimes\nblowing up, sometimes giving ground, but always fighting back sternly\nand vigorously and always rising through the clear spring evening.\n\nMurray Lee, at the rear of the ship, was the only one to see an American\nrocket-ship, caught and held for a few fatal moments by two yellow rays,\nslowly divest itself of its outer armor, then of its inner, and go\nwhirling to the earth, dissolved into its ultimate fragments by those\nirresistible pennons of sound.\n\nGloria Rutherford at the prow was the only one to see another caught\nbow-on in a yellow ray, reply by firing its gravity-beam right down the\nray and into the green globe through the port from which the ray had\nissued. The ray went out--a spreading spot of flame appeared at the port\nand the great green globe crumpled into a little ball of flame before\nher eyes. But such events as these were the merest flashes in the\nclose-locked combat. For the most part they had time to do nothing but\nhandle the controls, throw switches to and fro, shoot forth gravity-beam\nand lightning-flash in endless alternation at the Lassan ships of which\nthere always appeared to be one more right before them as Sherman\ntwisted and turned the _Monitor_ with a skill that was almost uncanny.\n\nSuddenly he pulled out; the four looked round. They were miles high;\nbelow half hidden in the dusk, were the red and brown roofs of a city.\nFar away on the horizon the battle still roared; a rolling cloud of\nsmoke now, shot with the vivid fires of the American lightning flashes.\nThe wings of their ship were spread; they were soaring gently earthward\nwithout the application of the rocket power.\n\n\"Had to get away for a minute,\" Sherman explained. \"We were heating up\nfrom the speed. My God, but we're high up; at least 45,000 feet!\"\n\n\"Yes, and getting higher,\" Ben pointed out. \"Those green globes must be\nheaded for the moon.\"\n\n\"Do you know, I wouldn't be a bit surprised but what you're right,\"\nreplied Sherman, \"I'll bet an oil-ball against the whole Lassan city\nthat they think we can't navigate space and they're trying to get above\nus and then hang around and pop us when we have to land. Well, come on\ngang, let's get back.\"\n\nHe shot the wings in again, worked the controls, and they headed back\ntoward the conflict.\n\nIt was less of a turmoil now, more of an ordered swing, charge, pass and\ncharge again against the diminishing number of the Lassan globes. Of the\nAmerican rocket-ships Gloria could now count but two beside their own.\nOne she had seen break up; whether the others, badly damaged, had hauled\nout for repairs, or whether, riven by the deadly yellow ray, they had\ngone crashing to the earth, there was no way of knowing. But the Lassans\nwere not escaping unharmed; there were hardly a third as many as at the\nbeginning and even as they approached another one disappeared in the\nvivid flash of the rocket's lightnings. Still the rest rose steadily on,\ngoing straight up as though they indeed hoped to escape their tormentors\nby rising to the moon.\n\nThey dived in: Gloria pressed the lightning key and another Lassan globe\nblew up; then they were climbing again. Beneath them the night had come.\nThe earth was a dark mass, far down, and from that enormous distance\nlooked slightly dished out at the edges. But though the earth was dark,\nat that ultimate height of the atmosphere the sun had not yet set. Still\nthe strange fight went on, higher and higher. The roar of the exhaust\nexplosions died away behind them and Murray looked questioningly at\nSherman.\n\n\"Out this far, there isn't much air,\" he said. \"Takes air to conduct\nsound. Wonder what they're up to, anyway. All right, Gloria.\"\n\nHe dived at another Lassan and she pressed the lightning ray; but this\ntime there was no flash, no flaming Lassan ship falling in ruins to the\nground.\n\n\"Who'd have thought it!\" said Sherman, as he swung the _Monitor_ round\nafter the charge. \"Of course--we're up so high that we've made a spark\ngap that even lightning won't jump. But I don't get their idea; those\nsound rays won't be any good out here, either.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nInto the Depths\n\n\nThe _Monitor_ turned again, speeding back toward the remaining Lassan\nships; with a startling shock of surprise, Gloria noticed that there\nwere only two. Down below them one of the last three American\nrocket-cruisers had spread her wings and was gliding gently toward the\nearth. Like the _Monitor's_, her crew had evidently found the lightning\nflash worthless at the enormous altitude and was abandoning the battle\ntill conditions became more favorable. The other rocket remained\nfaithful; turned as they turned and charged up with them toward the last\nof the Lassans.\n\nIt was a weird scene. They had climbed so far that the earth was now\nperceptibly round beneath them; a vague line marked the westward\nprogress of the sunset and beyond it the sun, an immense yellow ball,\nset with a crown of vividly red flames, hung in the inky-black heavens.\nOn the opposite side, the stars, more brilliant and greater in number\nthan any ever before viewed by the eye of man, made the sky a carpet of\nlight across which the green globes moved like shadows, their undersides\nillumined by the sun.\n\nAs the _Monitor_ approached, the nearest globe seemed to be turning on\nits axis. Suddenly, out of the side that faced them, came the quick,\nstabbing beam of the light-ray, like the flicker of a sword. It struck\nthe _Monitor_ full on the prow. There was a burning rain of sparks past\nthe windows; the rocket-ship leaped and quivered, and those within felt,\nrather than saw, something give. Then, with a tremendous explosion, all\nthe more horrible because utterly without sound, the great globe that\nhad thrown the ray, burst into fragments.\n\nAnd at the same moment the _Monitor_ began to fall. Down, down, down\nwent the rocket-cruiser with the round ball of the earth rising to meet\nthem at a speed incredible. The sun went out; they were swallowed in a\npurple twilight as they plunged. The earth changed from a ball to a\ndish, from a dish to a plane, from a plane to a dark mass without form,\nand in the mass vague lights and glimmerings of water came out, and\nstill their course was unchecked, still Sherman fought frantically with\nthe useless controls.\n\nDesperately Murray pressed the firing keys of the stern-rockets;\nunchecked she drove on, almost straight down, plunging to certain\ndestruction. The earth loomed nearer, nearer, the end seemed\ninevitable--.\n\nThen Gloria saved them. In some moment of inspiration, she threw on the\nsearchlight; and the automatic connection fired the gravity-beam. There\nwas a shattering report; the course of the _Monitor_ was halted, and\nbruised and broken, she tumbled over and over to the ground, safe but\nruined.\n\n\"Suffering Lassans!\" said Ben Ruby, as they picked themselves out of the\nwreckage, \"but that was a jar. What hit us, anyway?\"\n\nSherman pointed to Gloria, breathlessly. \"Give the little girl a hand,\"\nhe ejaculated. \"She sure pulled us out of the fire that time.\"\n\n\"I'll say she did,\" said Murray, \"but what happened, anyway? I thought\nthat light-ray of theirs wouldn't work on these ships.\"\n\n\"It won't--in air,\" said Sherman ruefully, surveying the wreck of the\n_Monitor_. \"But the air blankets down the effect a lot. Out there we got\nthe whole dose. Even then it shouldn't have hurt us so seriously, but I\nexpect a lot of our lead sheathing got jarred loose when we went through\nthose yellow rays and when they let that light-ray go, she leaked all\nover the place. Wonder what made that Lassan ship blow up like that,\nthough? I thought she sure had us.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Ben, \"I think maybe I did that. When the light-ray came on it\noccurred to me that the gravity-beam might go down their beam of light\njust as fast as it would down ours, and they must have a port-hole or\nsomething through their gravity-screen or they couldn't let the ray out.\nSo I just let them have it.\"\n\n\"Boy, you sure saved the lives of four of Uncle Sam's flying men that\ntime. About one second more of that stuff and we'd have cracked up right\nthere. Look at the front of our bus. The outer plating is all caved in\nand the inner is starting to go.\"\n\n\"She is pretty well used up isn't she? What gets me though, is that\nthere's one more of those things loose.\"\n\n\"Look!\" cried Gloria suddenly, pointing upward.\n\nFar in the zenith above them they saw a point of light; a point that\ngrew and spread and became definite as a great star; then it became a\nshooting star, plunging earthward, and so great was its speed that even\nas they watched they could make out a green fragment, flame-wrapped in\nits midst.\n\n\"The last one!\" said Sherman. \"Thank God for that. Wonder how they got\nher?\"\n\n\"Wonder what we do next,\" remarked Murray, practically.\n\nThey looked about them. They were on a hillside in a little clearing in\na high, narrow valley. On every side were woods, dark and impenetrable.\nJust below they could hear the purl of a brook, and the trees about them\nwere bare with the dark bareness of spring, a few fugitive buds being\nthe only announcement that the season of growing was at hand. No\nlandmarks, no roads were visible, and the sky was darkening fast.\n\n\"The question,\" said Gloria, \"is not where do we go, but where are we\ngoing from.\"\n\n\"It might be most anywhere,\" remarked Murray. \"Adirondacks, Catskills,\nor even Laurentians. I don't think we got far enough west for it to be\nthe Blue Ridge or the Appalachians, but there's no way of telling.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Gloria offered, \"I've been in a lot of mountains in my day, but\nI never saw any where following a stream didn't take you somewhere\nsooner or later. I vote we trail along with that brook there and see\nwhat happens.\"\n\n\"Bright thought,\" commented Ben. \"Let's see what we can dig out of the\nwreck by way of weapons.\"\n\n\"What for? There aren't any animals, and they couldn't hurt you if there\nwere. If we meet any of the Lassans any weapon you got out of that mess\nwouldn't be much use. Wish we had a flashlight though.\"\n\nTreading carefully, but with a good deal of noise and confusion, they\nbegan to crash their way through the underbrush along the bank of the\nstream. At the foot of the valley it dived over a diminutive waterfall\nand then tumbled into another similar brook. Along the combined streams\nran a road--a dirt road originally, now long untraveled, muddy and bad,\nbut still a road.\n\nAn hour's walking brought them around the foot of another mountain and\ninto a valley where the road divided before a projecting buttress of\nrock. A teetering sign-post stood at the fork. With some trouble, and\nafter getting himself immersed to the knees in the ditch, Murray managed\nto reach it and straining his eyes in the starlight, made out what it\nsaid. \"THIS WAY TO HAMILTON'S CHICKEN DINNERS. 1 MILE\" it read. With a\nsnort of disgust he hurled the deceitful guidepost into the ditch and\njoined the others.\n\n\"Toss a coin,\" someone suggested. No coins. A knife was flipped up\ninstead. It fell heads and in accordance with its decision they took the\nroad to the right. It led them along beside the stream for a while, then\nparted company with it and began to climb, and they soon found\nthemselves at the crest of the hill. The night had become darker and\ndarker, clouding over. But for the road they would have been completely\nlost. Finally, after skirting the hillcrest for a distance, the road\ndipped abruptly, and as it did so, they passed out of the forest into a\nregion cleared but not cultivated, with numerous close-cut stumps coming\nright to the roadside.\n\n\"But for the fact that it's a long ways away,\" remarked Sherman, \"I\nwould say that this was the district around the Lassan headquarters.\"\n\n\"What makes you think it's a long ways away?\" asked Gloria. \"Do you know\nwhere we are? Neither do I.\"\n\n\"By the nine gods of Clusium, I believe that's it, at that!\" said\nSherman suddenly as the road turned past a place where a long scar of\nearth ran up the hillside, torn and blackened. \"Look--that looks exactly\nlike the result of one of our gravity-beam shots! And there--isn't that\nthe door?\"\n\nThey were on the hillside now, directly above the place he had\nindicated. From above and in the darkness it appeared as a cliff,\nbreaking down rapidly to the valley, but Sherman led them to one side,\nstraight down the hill and in another moment they were at its base. The\ngreat door through which the green balls had poured out that evening\nstood before them, a mighty arch reaching up into the dimness--and it\nwas open.\n\n\"Looks like the boys haven't come home to supper yet,\" said Gloria in an\nawed whisper, contemplating the gigantic arch and the dark passage into\nwhich it led.\n\n\"Yes, and a lot of them aren't coming, either,\" replied Murray in a\nsimilar tone. \"But what do we do--make a break for it or poke in and see\nif anybody's home?\"\n\n\"Listen, you three,\" said Sherman. \"You run along and build some more\nmonitors and go get whatever comes out of here. Me, I'm going to have a\nwhirl at this door. The swellest girl in the world is in there, or was,\nand I'm going to find her.\"\n\n\"Nothing doing, old scout,\" said Ben. \"If you go in we go too--except\nGloria.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with me?\" she demanded. \"I'm made of the same kind of\nmachinery you are, aren't I? And I'm good enough to run your foolish\nfighting-machine. Don't be a goop.\" And she stepped forward.\n\nThe blue-domed hall that gave directly on the outer air had disappeared\nsince Sherman and Marta Lami had raced out of it on that night that now\nseemed so long ago. In its place was an enormous tunnel, lined\napparently with some metal, for its sides were smooth and shimmering.\nThe portion they entered was lightless, but it curved as it ran down,\nand around the curve they could see the faint reflection of a light\nsomewhere farther along the passage. Their feet echoed oddly in the\nenormous silence of the place. There seemed nothing alive or dead\nwithin.\n\n\"Boy,\" whispered Murray to Gloria, \"if one of those green globes comes\nback now it will squash us flatter than a false prosperity bankroll.\nThis is the craziest thing we ever did.\"\n\n\"Right,\" she said, \"but what the hell? I just came for the ride. Look,\nwhat's that?\"\n\nBefore them, around the bend of the passage, they could see another door\nfrom which the light which glittered along the tunnel was streaming. In\nthe opening stood a man, or what seemed to be a man, facing,\nfortunately, inwards.\n\nAfter a moment's cautious peering, Sherman pronounced him one of the\nape-man slaves. He wore a thought-helmet, and had some kind of a weapon\nin his hand. The four held a cautiously whispered conference.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Sherman, \"we've got to jump that baby before he does\nanything. I think he's got one of those small light-guns. Didn't know\nthey trusted them to the slaves, but I suppose so many of the Lassans\ngot shot up that they had to do it. Now, who's got a knife?\"\n\nA search of pockets revealed that Murray Lee had the only one in the\ncompany.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Sherman, \"one is enough. Now we three will sneak up\non him. The main thing is not to let him see us; if he makes a move,\njump him quick. Remember there's a Lassan at the other end of the line,\nand the Lassan is getting everything he thinks. He doesn't think very\nfast, but don't take chances. If he sees us, you hop in, Murray, and cut\nthe wire that leads out of his helmet and short-circuit it. They may\nhave it fixed so that it won't short-circuit by now but I don't think\nso. If he doesn't see us before we jump him, clap your hands over his\neyes, Ben, and I'll try to get the helmet off him and pass out some\ninformation to the Lassan at the other end that will keep him quiet. But\nthe main thing is to get that gun first. Everybody understand?\"\n\nThree heads nodded in unison.\n\n\"All right. Come on.\"\n\nThey crept up the passage together avoiding touching hands lest the ring\nof the metal should warn the sentry. As they approached they could see\nthe room he looked out on was one of the familiar blue-domed halls; the\npassage ended sharply some six feet above its floor (\"Taking no chances\non more escapes\" thought Sherman) and that the hall was of enormous\nsize. There were machines in one corner of the floor. In another stood\none of the green globes, half finished, with spidery trellises of red\nmetal outlining what would be the surface of the sphere. Around it\nhelmeted mechanical men came and went busily. The rest of the hall, for\nall its vast extent, was completely empty. At the far end was a row of\ndoors; high on the far side an opening that looked like a door but had\nno obvious purpose.\n\nThis much they saw; then the sentry stirred as though to turn, and with\na quick patter of feet, they were upon him. Before he had time to turn\naround Ben Ruby launched himself in a perfect football tackle for his\nlegs, bringing the ape-man down with a crash. As he fell, Sherman\nsnatched at the helmet, and Gloria the light-gun, which had dropped from\nhis fingers, while Murray pinioned the struggling creature's arms. In a\nmoment Sherman found the finger-holes in the helmet, pressed, and it\ncame loose in his hands while the ape-man ceased to struggle.\n\n\"Let him up now, folks,\" said Sherman, \"give him a swift kick and point\nhim toward the door. He won't come back.\" And he rapidly adjusted the\nthought-helmet to his own head.\n\nThe Lassan at the other end was evidently disturbed. He had received the\nsound of the crash from the ape-man's brain and was asking querulously\nwhat it meant.\n\n\"What has happened?\" the thought demanded insistently. \"What is it that\nstruck you? Have the fighting machines returned? Show a picture of what\nyou see. Are the slaves escaping?\"\n\n\"Everything's all right,\" Sherman sent back. \"Something broke loose down\nbelow and I stumbled trying to look at it.\" He closed his eyes, forming\na mental picture of the hall, with everything in order, then one of the\npassage, and reached up and detached the helmet, motioning to Murray for\nthe knife. An instant's sawing and the device short-circuited with a\nfizzing of blue sparks.\n\n\"That will give that one a headache for a while,\" he remarked. \"We'll\nhave to hurry, though. When he comes to he'll investigate and then\nthere'll be trouble.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Gloria, pointing across the hall at the aperture\nhigh up in the wall. A gleaming beak had been thrust out and the bright,\nintelligent eye of one of the dodo-birds was regarding them malevolently\nfrom the opening.\n\n\"Shoot, quick!\" said Sherman, \"For God's sake! They're telepathic.\nThey'll have every Lassan in the place after us.\"\n\nGloria fumbled a second with the gun, located the finger hole, sent a\nspurt of light flying across the room. It missed the head, but found its\nmark somewhere in the body of the bird, for there was a squawk and the\nhead disappeared. Sherman vaulted down the six-foot drop, landing with a\nbang. \"Come on,\" he cried, \"short-circuit every wire you can find; tear\nthem loose if you can't cut them any other way--and make for the middle\ndoor at the back.\"\n\nThey ran across the hall toward the work benches. It seemed enormous;\nlike a race in a dream, in which one seems to make no progress whatever.\nBut the workers did not appear to notice them. Driven by the thoughts of\nthe controlling Lassans, they were incapable of attending to anything\nelse unless it was forced on their attention.\n\nAs they approached the benches, however, one flat-faced ape-man almost\nran into them. His face took on an expression of puzzled inquiry and at\nthe same moment a figure whose carriage plainly showed it human stepped\ndown toward them from the half-completed green globe. Gloria paused,\nleveled her light-gun at the ape-man, and his face vanished in a spray\nof fire. The human advanced slowly as though struggling against some\nforce that was too strong for him. Sherman reached him first, wrenched\nthe helmet from his head and dropping it on the floor stamped on it till\nthe fine mechanism was irretrievably ruined. The mechanical human fell\nto his knees.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, \"God?\"\n\n\"We're all right,\" said Murray, and Sherman, \"which way to the living\ncages? Do you know Marta Lami?\"\n\nThe man shook his head like one recovering from a dream. \"I do' know,\"\nhe said, \"they had the helmets on me for twenty periods. I do' know\nnothing. We came through that door. In the little automobiles.\"\n\nHe indicated a door behind some of the machines.\n\nSpeed was urgent, but Sherman paused to instruct them briefly. \"There'll\nbe another sentry at the door. Pop him first, Gloria. Murray, take your\nknife, and Ben, get anything you can and cut all the wires on those\nbirds around here. There are some more wires leading out of the\nmachines. Be sure to get them, too. You might let loose something\nimportant. We'll try to get you another gun.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nThe Ending of It All\n\n\nImpassively, oblivious of the invasion about them, the workers kept on\nat their machines like ants when their nest is broken open. Sherman and\nGloria dodged around one of them, avoiding the direct line of sight of\nthe robot who worked at it and walked rapidly toward the door giving on\nthe car-tracks. The man on duty had no weapon, but paid them no\nattention, being occupied in watching a car just sliding in to the\nstation. \"It's a shame\" began Gloria, but \"Shoot!\" insisted Sherman and\nthe light-ray struck him in the back of the neck fusing head and neck to\na single mass. As he sank to the floor he turned partly over.\n\n\"Good heavens, it's Stevens!\" said Gloria, \"the man who organized the\nrebellion against Ben Ruby in New York and brought the dodos down on\nus.\"\n\n\"Never mind. Hurry,\" her companion urged in a fever of activity. The\ndoors of the car were opening and half a dozen mechanical men stepped\nout, mostly with the foolish visages and shambling steps of the ape-men,\nbut two whose upright walk proclaimed them human.\n\n\"Listen, everybody,\" called Sherman, quickly. \"We're from outside. We're\ntrying to bust up this place. Get back in the car, quick, and come help\nus.\" Suiting the action to the word, he leaped for the first\ncompartment, reached it just as it was closing and wedged himself\ninside.\n\nThe car had a considerable run to make. In the dimly-lighted\ncompartment, Sherman was conscious of turns, right, left, right again,\nand of a steady descent. He wondered vaguely whether he had taken the\nright method; whether the cage rooms lay near one another or were widely\nseparated. At all events the diversion in the hall of the green globes\nwould hold the attention of the Lassans for some time, and the\nshort-circuiting of so many lines would hamper their methods of dealing\nwith the emergency....\n\nThe car came to a stop. Sherman heard a door or two open, but his own\ndid not budge, and he had no needle to stir it. He must wait, hoping\nthat Gloria had not been isolated from him. She had the ray-gun at all\nevents, and would not be helpless. Then the door opened again.\n\nHe was released into a cage that seemed already occupied, and one look\ntold him that his companion was an ape-man.\n\n\"Gloria!\" he called.\n\n\"Right here,\" came the cheerful answer from two cages down. \"This is a\nswell thing you got me into. How do we get out of here?\"\n\n\"Have you got a pin or needle of any kind?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why--yes. Turn your back.\" She did something mysterious among her\nfeminine garments and held up an open safety-pin for him to see across\nthe intervening cage.\n\n\"Stick your arm through the bars and see if you can toss it down the\ntrack. If I don't get it, you'll have to blast your way out with the\nlight-gun, but I don't like to do that. Don't know how many shots it\nholds and we need them all.\"\n\nShe swung with that underarm motion which is the nearest any woman can\nachieve to a throw. The pin struck the gleaming car-rail, skidded,\nturned and came to rest before Sherman's cage. He reached for it, but\nthe ape-man in the cage, who had been watching with interested eyes, was\nquicker. Fending Sherman off with one huge paw, he reached one of his\nfeet through the bars for the object and held it up before his eyes\nadmiringly.\n\nSherman grabbed, but this only fixed the ape-man in his evident opinion\nthat the object he held was of value. He gripped it all the tighter,\nturned an amiable face toward Sherman and gibbered. Losing patience at\nthis unfortunate contretemps when time was so precious, the aviator\nlifted an iron foot and kicked him, vigorously and with purpose, in the\nplace where kicks do the most good. The ape-man pitched forward,\ndropping the fascinating pin, then rose and came toward Sherman, his\nexpression clearly indicating his intention of tearing the American limb\nfrom limb. The cage was narrow: the ape-man the bigger of the two.\nSherman thought hard and fast. The oil-ball!\n\nHe leaped for the lectern, snatched it open, seized the ape-man's\noil-ball and held it aloft as though to throw it out into the corridor.\nWith a wail of anguish the simian clutched at the precious object.\nSherman squeezed it enough to let a little stream run forth, holding it\njust out of his reach, and as he stabbed for it again, tossed it back\ninto a corner of the cell. The ape-man leaped upon it covetously, and\nSherman bent over the bars, fumbling in his nervous haste to unlock\nthem.\n\nLuckily the safety-pin fitted. With a subdued click the bars swung\ninward and he was out in the corridor. Another moment and Gloria was\nfree also.\n\n\"Any more people in here?\" Sherman called. Three voices answered and he\nhurried from cage to cage, setting them free as the warning blue lights\nthat prohibited shouting began to flicker around the roof.\n\n\"Come on,\" he called, \"we must get out of here, quick!\"\n\nThey hesitated a moment between the two doors, chose that at the upper\nend. As they raced through it, they heard a panel clash somewhere. The\nLassans were investigating.\n\nThey were in one of the passages through which the cars ran, with\nalternate bars of light and dark across it marking the termination of\nside-passages. \"Look!\" said Gloria. Into the cage-room they had just\nquitted a car was coming, its featureless front gliding noiselessly\nalong the track. \"In here,\" said Sherman, pulling the others after him\ndown the nearest lighted passage.\n\nFollowed by the other four Sherman followed it steadily along to the\nright, where it ended at a door.\n\n\"What now?\" said someone.\n\n\"In,\" decided Gloria. \"Likely to be a cage-room as not.\"\n\nSherman searched for the inevitable finger-holes, found them and\npressed. The door swung back on--\n\nA Lassan reclining at ease on one of the curious twisted benches beside\nwhich stood a tall jar of the same yellow-flecked green material they\nhad seen the others devouring. The room was blue-domed but very small,\nand its walls were covered with soft green hangings in pendulous drops.\nA thought-helmet was on the elephant-man's head; its other end was worn\nby one of the mechanical people whose back was to the door as they\nentered, and who appeared to be working some kind of machine that\npunched little holes of varying shape in a strip of bright metal.\n\nAs the five Americans pressed into the room, the Lassan rose, reached\nfor his ray-gun, but Gloria pushed the one she held into his face and he\nrelaxed with a little squeal of terror, while Sherman reached into his\npouch and secured the weapon.\n\nAs he did so the Lassan reached up and snapped loose the thought-helmet;\nthe metal figure turned round and gazed at them.\n\n\"Marta!\"\n\n\"The boy friend!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Lassan was very old. His skin was almost white and seamed with sets\nof diminutive wrinkles, and as he regarded the two mechanical people,\nlocked in each other's embrace an expression of puzzlement and distaste\ncame over his features, giving place to one of cool and lofty dignity as\nhe perceived that Gloria did not mean to kill him on the spot. Lifting\nhis trunk, he motioned imperiously toward the thought-helmet which Marta\nhad cast aside, then set the other end of it on his own head.\n\nTo the invading Americans, crowded into the little room, it seemed for a\nmoment as though they had somehow burst into a temple. Sherman's face\nbecame grave, and following the Lassan's direction, he picked up the\nhelmet and fitted it on his head. The thought that came through it gave\na feeling of dignity and power such as he had never experienced before;\nalmost as though it were some god talking.\n\n\"By what right,\" it demanded, \"do you invade the room of scientific\ncomposition? Why are you not in your cages? You know you will receive\nthe punishment of the yellow lights in the greater degree for this\nunauthorized invasion. Save yourself further punishment now by retiring\nquietly. You can take my life, it is true, but I am old and my life is\nof no value. Think not that I am the only Lassan in the universe.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Sherman gave him back, \"but this is a rebellion. You are not\nfamiliar with the history of this planet, or you would know that\nAmericans can't be anybody's slaves. Let us go in peace and we will let\nyou return to your own planet.\"\n\n\"Let us go!\" came the Lassan's answer. \"Your obstinate presumption\nsurprises me. Do you think that the Lassans of Rigel, the highest race\nin the universe will let go where they have once grasped?\"\n\n\"You will or we'll jolly well make you,\" replied the American. \"Do you\nthink your silly green globes are going to do you any good? The last\none fell beside us tonight.\"\n\nSherman could sense the sudden wave of panic in the Lassan's thought at\nthis unexpected answer. He had evidently assumed that they were from the\nunderground labor battalions and were not familiar with events outside.\nBut he rallied nobly.\n\n\"And do you imagine, foolish creature of a lower race, that the green\nglobes are our last resource? Even now I have perfected a device that\nwill wipe your miserable people from the planet. But if it did not,\nrather would we Lassans perish in the flames of a ruined world than\nabandon a task once undertaken; we who can mold the plastic flesh to\nenduring metal and produce machines that have brains; we who can control\nthe great substance that underlies all life and matter.\"\n\n\"Well, here's one task you're going to abandon,\" Sherman thought back.\n\"We, who can call lightning from the skies, are going to give you a\nterrible sock on the--trunk, if you don't. If you doubt it try and find\nhow many Lassans live after today's battle. Go on back where you came\nfrom. You're not wanted in this world.\"\n\n\"You know, or should know, the law of evolution,\" replied the Lassan.\n\"The weaker and less intelligent must ever give way before the stronger.\nBy the divine right of--\" his flow of thought stopped suddenly, changed\nto a wild tumult of panic. Sherman looked up. Round the rim of the blue\ndome, where it stood above the hangings, a string of lights was winking\noddly, in a strange, uneven rhythm. \"God of the Lassans, deliver us!\"\nthe thought that reached his own was saying. \"The tanks are broken--the\nlight is loose!\" Then suddenly his mind was closed and when it opened\nagain it had taken on a new calmness and dignity and a certain god-like\nstrength.\n\n\"I do not know how or where,\" it told Sherman, \"but an accident has\nhappened. Perhaps an accident produced by your strange and active race.\nThe connections have broken; the tanks of the substance of life in the\nbowels of this mountain have broken and the whole is set free. It is\nhard to see the labor of centuries thus destroyed; to see you, creatures\nof a lower race, inherit a world so divinely adapted to the rule of\nintelligence.\n\n\"For in this accident the whole of our race must perish if you have told\nthe truth about the destruction of our green globes. We called in all\nthe Lassans from your world for the work of the destruction of your\narmies. Yes, you told the truth. Your mind is open, I can see it. We are\nlost.... There is no hope remaining; it means destruction or the metal\nmetamorphosis for every living Lassan, and there will be none to endow\nthem with the life in metal we have given you.\n\n\"Perhaps it was our own fault. Your curious race, for all its defects,\nhas certain qualities of intelligence, and above all that strange\nquality of activity and what you call courage. If we could have summoned\nup the same activity; if we had possessed the same courage to attack\nagainst odds, this would not have happened. It is our failure that we\nhave depended too much on naked intellect; learned to do too many things\nthrough the hands of our servants. Had Lassans been at the controls of\nour fighting ships, instead of the automatons we used, you would never\nhave conquered them so easily.\n\n\"Be that as it may. We have lost and you have won. I can show myself\nmore generous than you would have been, and thus can gain a victory over\nyou. If you would escape, follow the car-track straight on to where it\nforks; then take the left-hand turning. If you would be restored to\nyour former and imperfect and repulsive form (though I cannot conceive\nwhy you should, being permanently fixed in beautiful and immortal\nmetal), do not run away, but await the coming of the substance of life\nin the outer hall or passage, being careful not to approach it too\nclosely or to touch it, so that you may receive the emanation only. It\nis this emanation, surrounding our space ship that produced your present\nform, which we changed to machinery by our surgery; and it so acts on\nthe metal of which you are composed that it will reverse the case. As\nfor me I am old and tired; already the walls of this place tremble to\nthe coming of my doom. Leave me, before I regret what I have told you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe reached his trunk up and disconnected the thought-helmet, and\nstanding up, with a certain high dignity, pointed to the door.\n\nRelieved of the helmet Sherman could hear a confused roaring like that\non the day when Marta Lami and he had short-circuited the mining\nmachine. \"Come on,\" he called to the rest, dropping the helmet. \"Hell's\nlet loose. We've got to hurry.\"\n\nOutside the roaring was perceptibly louder and seemed to be approaching.\nAs they leaped down to the track a faint glow was borne to them redly\nalong the rail. The ape-men in the cage-room they had escaped from were\nhowling and beating the bars of their cages, with no blue lights to\nforbid them.\n\nThe track was slippery--Marta Lami and the three they had released from\nthe cage room, unshod. Sherman gripped her by the hand. \"Hurry, oh,\nhurry,\" he panted, pulling her along.\n\nThey passed another passage, down which a door stood open. The soft\nlight that normally illuminated the place was flickering wildly, they\ncaught a glimpse of three or four Lassans within, stirring wildly,\nrushing from place to place, trying this connection and that. The dull\nsound behind them increased; the track grew steeper.\n\n\"What about the rest?\" gasped Gloria, running by his side.\n\n\"Don't know,\" he answered. \"They did something. The whole place is\ncoming down.\"\n\nAs they rounded a corner the track forked before them. Remembering the\nLassan's parting instructions, Sherman led them to the left, passed\nanother passage mouth, and they found themselves in a small blue-domed\nhall, empty save for a single car that stood on the track. There was\njust room to squeeze past it where the passage began again at the other\nend. And as they made it the roaring sound changed to a series of\nexplosions, sharp and clear. The ground trembled, seemed to tilt; the\ncar slid backward into the passage they had just vacated.\n\nTen feet, twenty-five feet more--and they were on the platform leading\nto the hall of the green globes. Sherman swung himself up, offered a\nhand to Marta. In a moment the others were beside them and they were\ndarting for the door. The ground was trembling again, shock after shock.\nSomething fell with a crash as they raced across the platform and into\nthe hall.\n\nWithin, all was confused darkness and a babble of sound. A dodo screamed\nsomewhere. An ape-man ran past them, gibbering, mad with fright, and\ndived to the track. Sherman ran across the hall, followed by Marta and\nthe three he had released. Gloria halted.\n\n[Illustration: Behind them something fell with a crash; ape-men ran\ngibbering with fright.]\n\n\"Murray!\" she cried, \"Murray!\" and then lifted the light-gun and sent a\npencil of fire screeching to the roof. There was an answering shock as\nsomething tumbled from the ceiling.\n\n\"Murray!\" she called again, at the top of her voice. Behind them,\nthrough the platform something fell with a crash and a long red flame\nlicked through the door, throwing tall shadows and weird lights across\nthe bedlam within.\n\n\"Here!\" came a voice, and Gloria turned to see Murray and Ben running\ntoward her.\n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"hurry. The works is busted.\"\n\nThey made the doorway just as Sherman was pulling Marta up the six-foot\nstep. Ben and Murray lifted Gloria in their arms, tossed her up. The red\nflame in the background had given place to a white one, and a boiling\nwhite mass of something was sending a long tongue creeping across the\nfloor.\n\nWilling arms snatched at those of Ben and Murray, pulling them upward to\nsafety. They turned to run down the tunnel.\n\n\"No!\" cried Sherman. \"Stick! It's all right. The old bloke told me so.\"\n\nThere was another explosion and a great white cloud rolled toward them\nabove the liquid tide. Then they lapsed into unconsciousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMurray Lee yawned and sat up.\n\nThe others lay around him in curious piled attitudes as though they had\ndropped off to sleep in the midst of something. He noted, with a shock\nof surprise, that Ben Ruby's face, turned in his direction, was not\nmetal, but good, honest flesh and blood. He gazed at his own hands.\nFlesh and blood likewise. He looked around.\n\nThe hall of the blue dome had vanished. A tangled mass of rock, cemented\nin some grey material, was before them, obscure in the darkness. At the\nother end was the passage, its ceiling fallen here and there, its sides\ncaved in. But a stream of light showed that an opening still led to the\noutside.\n\nHe bent over and shook Gloria. She came to with a start, looked about\nher, and said with an air of surprise, \"Oh, have I been asleep? Why,\nwhat's happened to you Murray? You need a shave.\" Then felt of her own\nface and found it smooth again.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake!\" she ejaculated.\n\nThe sound brought the rest bolt upright. Sherman looked round at the\nothers, then at the passage, and smiled with satisfaction.\n\n\"That old Lassan,\" he remarked, \"told me the metal evolution would\nreverse if we got the emanation without letting the stuff touch us.\nWell, he was a sport.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\" said Marta Lami, standing up and feeling of herself. \"Look\nwhat they did to us. My toes are flexible and my figure bulges in such\nqueer places. I'll never be able to dance again. Oh, well, I suppose it\ndoesn't matter--I'll be marrying the boy friend anyway.\" She took\nSherman's hand and he blushed with embarrassment.\n\n\"Good idea,\" said Murray Lee and looked hard at Gloria.\n\nShe nodded and turned her head.\n\n\"Ho hum,\" said Ben Ruby. \"The dictator of New York seems to be _de\ntrop_. How does one get out of here?\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Transcriber's Note: Hyphen variations left as printed.]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Onslaught from Rigel, by Fletcher Pratt\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ONSLAUGHT FROM RIGEL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 41049-8.txt or 41049-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/1/0/4/41049/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
