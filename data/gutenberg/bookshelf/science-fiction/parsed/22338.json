Janifer) Phillips (Randall Philip Garrett) has, or have,\nundergone several changes. In order to keep the reader posted on the\nlatest developments regarding this author, or these authors, he, or\nthey, has, or have, passed on the following details:\n\nGARRETT is still engaged. He and his charming fiancee plan to run out\nof excuses during the early Fall of 1994, but this date may be changed\nat any time by mutual agreement, or the end of the world. He has given\nup an interest in river pollution in favor of a new hobby, grading\ntype-cleaner. Garrett, who spends an hour each day expanding his\nrepertoire, now claims the ability to distinguish year and vineyard\nfor over one thousand type-cleaners.\n\nJANIFER is still on the other hand. He has had his eyeglasses cleaned,\nand is happy to report that he has recently met a woman. The woman,\nhowever, seems to have been looking for a man. Janifer's hobbies,\nhumming and blinking, remain constant, but in an effort to add more\nhealthful activity to his life he has begun training in leaping to\nconclusions. He states that he can now clear a conclusion of better\nthan seven feet, eight and one-half inches from a running start.\n\nTHE IMPOSSIBLES was written in six days. On the seventh day, nothing\nof any interest whatsoever occurred.\n\n\n                           The Impossibles\n\n                            Mark Phillips\n\n\nTo John J.,\n\nwithout whose accident in 1945 this series would not have been\npossible.\n\n\n                                  1\n\nThe sidewalk was as soft as a good bed. Malone lay curled on it,\nthinking about nothing at all. He was drifting off into a wonderful\ndream, and he didn't want to interrupt it. There was this girl, a\nbeautiful girl, more wonderful than anything he had ever imagined,\nwith big blue eyes and long blonde hair and a figure that made the\naverage pin-up girl look like a man. And she had her soft white hand\non his arm, and she was looking, up at him with trust and devotion and\neven adoration in her eyes, and her voice was the softest possible\nwhisper of innocence and promise.\n\n\"I'd love to go up to your apartment with you, Mr. Malone,\" she said.\n\nMalone smiled back at her, gently but with complete confidence. \"Call\nme Ken,\" he said, noticing that he was seven feet tall and superbly\nmuscled. He put his free hand on the girl's warm, soft shoulder and\nshe wriggled with delight.\n\n\"All right--Ken,\" she said. \"You know, I've never met anyone like you\nbefore. I mean, you're so wonderful and everything.\"\n\nMalone chuckled modestly, realizing, in passing, how full and rich his\nvoice had become. He felt a weight pressing over his heart, and knew\nthat it was his wallet, stuffed to bursting with thousand-dollar\nbills.\n\nBut was this a time to think of money?\n\nNo, Malone told himself. This was the time for adventure, for romance,\nfor love. He looked down at the girl and put his arm around her waist.\nShe snuggled closer.\n\nHe led her easily down the long wide street to his car at the end of\nthe block. It stood in godlike solitude, a beautiful red Cadillac\ncapable of going a hundred and ten miles an hour in any gear, equipped\nwith fully automatic steering and braking, and with a stereophonic\nradio, a hi-fi and a 3-D set installed in both front and back seats.\nIt was a 1972 job, but he meant to trade it in on something even\nbetter when the 1973 models came out. In the meantime, he decided, it\nwould do.\n\nHe handed the girl in, went round to the other side and slid in under\nthe wheel. There was soft music playing somewhere, and a magnificent\nsunset appeared ahead of them as Malone pushed a button on the\ndashboard and the red Cadillac started off down the wide, empty,\nwonderfully paved street into the sunset, while he... The red\nCadillac?\n\nThe sidewalk became a little harder, and, Malone suddenly realized\nthat he was lying on it. Something terrible had happened; he knew that\nright away. He opened his eyes to look for the girl, but the sunset\nhad become much brighter; his head began to pound with the slow\nregularity of a dead-march, and he closed his eyes again in a hurry.\n\nThe sidewalk swayed a little, but he managed to keep his balance on it\nsomehow; and after a couple of minutes it was quiet again. His head\nhurt. Maybe that was the terrible thing that had happened, but Malone\nwasn't quite sure. As a matter of fact, he wasn't very sure about\nanything, and he started to ask himself questions to make certain he\nwas all there.\n\nHe didn't feel all there. He felt as if several of his parts had been\nreplaced with second- or even third-hand experimental models, and\nsomething had happened to the experiment. It was even hard to think of\nany questions, but after a while he managed to come up with a few.\n\n_What is your name?_\n\nKenneth Malone.\n\n_Where do you live?_\n\nWashington, D. C.\n\n_What is your work?_\n\nI work for the FBI.\n\n_Then what the hell are you doing on a sidewalk in New York in broad\ndaylight?_\n\nHe tried to find an answer to that, but there didn't seem to be any,\nno matter where he looked. The only thing he could think of was the\nred Cadillac.\n\nAnd if the red Cadillac had anything to do with anything, Malone\ndidn't know about it.\n\nVery slowly and carefully, he opened his eyes again, one at a time. He\ndiscovered that the light was not coming from the gorgeous Hollywood\nsunset he had dreamed up. As a matter of fact, sunset was several\nhours in the past, and it never looked very pretty in New York anyhow.\nIt was the middle of the night, and Malone was lying under a\nconvenient street lamp.\n\nHe closed his eyes again and waited patiently for his head to go away.\n\nA few minutes passed. It was obvious that his head had settled down\nfor a long stay, and no matter how bad it felt, Malone told himself,\nit _was_ his head, after all. He felt a certain responsibility for it.\nAnd he couldn't just leave it lying around somewhere with its eyes\nclosed.\n\nHe opened the head's eyes once more, and this time he kept them open.\nFor a long time he stared at the post of the street lamp, considering\nit, and he finally decided that it looked sturdy enough to support a\nhundred and sixty-five pounds of FBI man, even with the head added in.\nHe grabbed for the post with both hands and started to pull himself\nupright, noticing vaguely that his legs had somehow managed to get\nunderneath him.\n\nAs soon as he was standing, he wished he'd stayed on the nice\nhorizontal sidewalk. His head was spinning dizzily, and his mind was\nbeing sucked down into the whirlpool. He held on to the post grimly\nand tried to stay conscious.\n\nA long time, possibly two or three seconds, passed. Malone hadn't\nmoved at all when the two cops came along.\n\nOne of them was a big man with a brassy voice and a face that looked\nas if it had been overbaked in a waffle iron. He came up behind Malone\nand tapped him on the shoulder, but Malone barely felt the touch. Then\nthe cop bellowed into Malone's ear: \"What's the matter, buddy?\"\n\nMalone appreciated the man's sympathy. It was good to know that you\nhad friends. But he wished, remotely, that the cop and his friend, a\nshorter and thinner version of the beat patrolman, would go away and\nleave him in peace. Maybe he could lie down on the sidewalk again and\nget a couple of hundred years' rest.\n\nWho could tell? \"Mallri,\" he said.\n\n\"You're all right?\" the big cop said. \"That's fine. That's great. So\nwhy don't you go home and sleep it off?\"\n\n\"Sleep?\" Malone said. \"Home?\"\n\n\"Wherever you live, buddy,\" the big cop said. \"Come on. Can't stand\naround on the sidewalk all night.\"\n\nMalone shook his head, and decided at once never to do it again. He\nhad some kind of rare disease, he realized. His brain was loose, and\nthe inside of his skull was covered with sandpaper. Every time his\nhead moved, the brain jounced against some of the sandpaper.\n\nBut the policemen thought he was drunk. That wasn't right. He couldn't\nlet the police get the wrong impression of FBI agents. Now the men\nwould go around telling people that the FBI was always drunk and\ndisorderly.\n\n\"Not drunk,\" he said clearly.\n\n\"Sure,\" the big cop said. \"You're fine. Maybe just one too many, huh?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. The effort exhausted him, and he had to catch his\nbreath before he could say anything else. But the cops waited\npatiently. At last he said, \"Somebody slugged me.\"\n\n\"Slugged?\" the big cop said.\n\n\"Right.\" Malone remembered just in time not to nod his head.\n\n\"How about a description, buddy?\" the big cop said.\n\n\"Didn't see him,\" Malone said. He let go of the post with one hand,\nkeeping a precarious grip with the other. He stared at his watch. The\nhands danced back and forth, but he focused on them after a while. It\nwas 1:05. \"Happened just--a few minutes ago,\" he said. \"Maybe you can\ncatch him.\"\n\nThe big cop said, \"Nobody around here. The place is deserted--except\nfor you, buddy.\" He paused and then added: \"Let's see some\nidentification, huh? Or did he take your wallet?\"\n\nMalone thought about getting the wallet, and decided against it. The\nmotions required would be a little tricky, and he wasn't sure he could\nmanage them without letting go of the post entirely. At last he\ndecided to let the cop get his wallet. \"Inside coat pocket,\" he said.\n\nThe other policeman blinked and looked up. His face was a studied\nblank. \"Hey, buddy,\" he said. \"You know you got blood on your head?\"\n\n\"Be damned,\" the big cop said. \"Sam's right. You're bleeding, mister.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\n The big cop said, \"Huh?\"\n\n\"I thought maybe my skull was going to explode from high blood\npressure,\" Malone said. It was beginning to be a little easier to\ntalk. \"But as long as there's a slow leak, I guess I'm out of danger.\"\n\n\"Get his wallet,\" Sam said. \"I'll watch him.\"\n\nA hand went into Malone's jacket pocket. It tickled a little bit, but\nMalone didn't think of objecting. Naturally enough, the hand and\nMalone's wallet did not make an instantaneous connection. When the\nhand touched the bulky object strapped near Malone's armpit, it\nstopped, frozen, and then cautiously snaked the object out.\n\n\"What's that, Bill?\" Sam said.\n\nBill looked up with the object in his hand. He seemed a little dazed.\n\"It's a gun,\" he said.\n\n\"My God,\" Sam said. \"The guy's heeled! Watch him! Don't let him get\naway!\"\n\nMalone considered getting away, and decided that he couldn't move.\n\"It's okay,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay, hell,\" Sam said. \"It's a .44 Magnum. What are you doing with a\ngun, Mac?\" He was no longer polite and friendly. \"Why [are] you\ncarrying a gun?\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not carrying it,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Bill is. Your pal.\"\n\nBill backed away from Malone, putting the Magnum in his pocket and\nkeeping the FBI agent covered with his own Police Positive. At the\nsame time, he fished out the personal radio every patrolman carried in\nhis uniform, and began calling for a prowl car in a low, somewhat\nnervous voice.\n\nSam said, \"My God. A gun. He could of shot everybody.\"\n\n\"Get his wallet,\" Bill said. \"He can't hurt you now. I disarmed him.\"\n\nMalone began to feel slightly dangerous. Maybe he _was_ a famous\ngangster. He wasn't sure. Maybe all this about being an FBI agent was\njust a figment of his imagination. Blows on the head did funny things.\n\"I'll drill everybody full of holes,\" he said in a harsh, underworld\nsort of voice, but it didn't sound very convincing. Sam approached him\ngently and fished out his wallet with great care, as if Malone were a\nticking bomb ready to go off any second.\n\nThere was a little silence. Then Sam said, \"Give him his gun back,\nBill,\" in a hushed and respectful tone.\n\n\"Give him back his gun?\" the big cop said. \"You gone nuts, Sam?\"\n\nSam shook his head slowly. \"Nope,\" he said. \"But we made a terrible\nmistake. Know who this guy is?\"\n\n\"He's heeled,\" Bill said. \"That's all I want to know.\" He put the\nradio away and gave all his attention to Malone.\n\n\"He's FBI,\" Sam said. \"The wallet says so. Badge and everything. And\nnot only that, Bill. He's Kenneth J. Malone.\"\n\nWell, Malone thought with relief, that settled that. He wasn't a\ngangster after all. He was just the FBI agent he had always known and\nloved. Maybe now the cops would do-something about his head and take\nhim away for burial.\n\n\"Malone?\" Bill said. \"You mean the guy who's here about all those red\nCadillacs?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Sam said. \"So give him his gun back.\" He looked at Malone.\n\"Listen, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"We're sorry. We're sorry as hell.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" Malone said absently. He moved his head slowly and\nlooked around. His suspicions were confirmed. There wasn't a red\nCadillac anywhere in sight, and from the looks of the street there\nnever had been. \"It's gone,\" he said, but the cops weren't listening.\n\n\"We better get you to a hospital,\" Bill said. \"As soon as the prowl\ncar gets here, we'll take you right on down to St. Vincent's. Can you\ntell us what happened? Or is it classified?\"\n\nMalone wondered what could be classified about a blow on the head, and\ndecided not to think about it. \"I can tell you,\" he said, \"if you'll\nanswer one question for me.\"\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Malone,\" Bill said. \"We'll be glad to help.\"\n\n\"Anything at all,\" Sam said.\n\nMalone gave them what he hoped was a gracious and condescending smile.\n\"All right, then,\" he said. \"Where the hell am I?\"\n\n\"In New York,\" Sam said.\n\n\"I know that,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Anywhere in particular, or just\nsort of all over New York?\"\n\n\"Ninth Street,\" Bill said hurriedly. \"Near the Village. Is that where\nyou were when they slugged you?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Malone said. \"Sure.\" He nodded, and immediately\nremembered that he shouldn't have. He closed his eyes until the pain\nhad softened to agony, and then opened them again. \"I was getting\npretty tired of sitting around waiting for something to break on this\ncase,\" he said, \"and I couldn't sleep, so I went out for a walk. I\nended up in Greenwich Village--which is a hell of a place for a\nself-respecting man to end up.\"\n\n\"I know just what you mean,\" Sam said sympathetically. \"Bohemians,\nthey call themselves. Crazy people.\"\n\n\"Not the people,\" Malone said. \"The streets. I got sort of lost.\"\nChicago, he reflected, was a long way from the easiest city in the\nworld to get around in. And he supposed you could even get confused in\nWashington if you tried hard enough. But he knew those cities. He\ncould find his way around in them. Greenwich Village was different.\n\nIt was harder to navigate in than the trackless forests of the Amazon.\nThe Village had tracks, all right--thousands of tracks. Only none of\nthem led anywhere in particular.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Malone said, \"I saw this red Cadillac.\"\n\nThe cops looked around hurriedly and then looked back at Malone. Bill\nstarted to say, \"But there isn't any--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"It's gone now. That's the trouble.\"\n\n\"You mean somebody got in and drove it away?\" Sam said.\n\n\"For all I know,\" Malone said, \"it sprouted wings and flew away.\" He\npaused. \"When I saw it, though--when I saw it, I decided to go over\nand have a look. Just in case.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Bill said. \"Makes sense.\" He stared at his partner as if\ndefying him to prove it didn't make sense. Malone didn't really care.\n\n\"There wasn't anybody else on the street,\" he said, \"so I walked over\nand tried the door. That's all. I didn't even open the car or\nanything. And I'll swear there was nobody behind me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Sam said, \"the street was empty when we got here.\"\n\n\"But a guy could have driven off in that red Cadillac before we got\nhere,\" Bill said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But where did he come from? I figured maybe\nsomebody dropped something by mistake--a safe or something. Because\nthere wasn't anybody behind me.\"\n\n\"There had to be,\" Bill said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"there wasn't.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"What happened then?\" Sam said. \"After you tried the door handle, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Then?\" Malone said. \"Then I went out like a light.\"\n\nA pair of headlights rounded the nearby corner. Bill looked up.\n\"That's the prowl car,\" he announced, and went over to meet it.\n\nThe driver was a solidly built little man with the face of a\nPekingese. His partner, a tall man who looked as if he'd have been\nmuch more comfortable in a ten-gallon Stetson instead of the\nregulation blue cap, leaned out at Bill, Sam, and Malone.\n\n\"What's the trouble here?\" he said in a harsh, high voice.\n\n\"No trouble,\" Bill said, and went over to the car. He began talking to\nthe two cops inside in a low, urgent voice. Meanwhile, Sam got his arm\naround Malone and began pulling him away from the lamp post.\n\nMalone was a little unwilling to let go, at first. But Sam was\nstronger than he looked. He convoyed the FBI agent carefully to the\nrear door of the prowl car, opened it and levered Malone gently to a\nseat inside, just as Bill said, \"So with the cut and all, we figured\nhe ought to go over to St. Vincent's. You people were already on the\nway, so we didn't bother with ambulances.\"\n\nThe driver snorted. \"Next time you want taxi service,\" he said, \"you\njust call us up. What do you think, a prowl car's an easy life?\"\n\n\"Easier than doing a beat,\" Bill said mournfully. \"And anyway,\" he\nadded in a low, penetrating whisper, \"the guy's FBI.\"\n\n\"So the FBI's got all kinds of equipment,\" the driver said. \"The\nlatest. Why don't he whistle up a helicopter or a jet?\" Then,\napparently deciding that further invective would get him nowhere, he\nsettled back in his seat, said, \"Aah, forget it,\" and started the car\nwith a small but perceptible jerk.\n\nMalone decided not to get into the argument. He was tired, and it was\nlate. He rested his head on the back seat and tried to relax, but all\nhe could do was think about red Cadillacs.\n\nHe wished he had never even heard of red Cadillacs.\n\n\n                                  2\n\nAnd it had all started so simply, too. Malone remembered very clearly\nthe first time he had had any indication that red Cadillacs were\nanything unusual, or special. Before that, he'd viewed them all with\nslightly wistful eyes: red, blue, green, gray, white, or even black\nCadillacs were all the same to him. They spelled luxury and wealth and\ndisplay, and a lot of other nice things.\n\nNow, he wasn't at all sure what they spelled. Except that it was\ndefinitely uncomfortable, and highly baffling.\n\nHe'd walked into the offices of Andrew J. Burris, Director of the FBI,\njust one week ago. It was a beautiful office, pine-paneled and\nspacious, and it boasted an enormous polished desk. And behind the\ndesk sat Burris himself, looking both tired and somehow a little\nkindly.\n\n\"You sent for me, Chief?\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right.\" Burris nodded. \"Malone, you've been working too hard\nlately.\"\n\nNow, Malone thought, it was coming. The dismissal he'd always feared.\nAt last Burris had found out that he wasn't the bright, intelligent,\nfearless, and alert FBI agent he was supposed to be. Burris had\ndiscovered that he was nothing more or less than lucky, and that all\nthe \"fine jobs\" he was supposed to have done were only the result of\nluck.\n\nOh, well, Malone thought. Not being an FBI agent wouldn't be so bad.\nHe could always find another job.\n\nOnly at the moment he couldn't think of one he liked.\n\nHe decided to make one last plea. \"I haven't been working so hard,\nChief,\" he said. \"Not too hard, anyhow. I'm in great shape. I--\"\n\n\"I've taken advantage of you, Malone, that's what I've done,\" Burris\nsaid, just as if Malone hadn't spoken at all. \"Just because you're the\nbest agent I've got, that's no reason for me to hand you all the tough\nones.\"\n\n\"Just because I'm what?\" Malone said, feeling slightly faint.\n\n\"I've given you the tough ones because you could handle them,\" Burris\nsaid. \"But that's no reason to keep loading jobs on you. After that\njob you did on the Gorelik kidnaping, and the way you wrapped up the\nTransom counterfeit ring--well, Malone, I think you need a little\nrelaxation.\"\n\n\"Relaxation?\" Malone said, feeling just a little bit pleased. Of\ncourse, he didn't deserve any of the praise he was getting, he knew.\nHe'd just happened to walk in on the Gorelik kidnapers because his\ntelephone had been out of order. And the Transom ring hadn't been just\nhis job. After all, if other agents hadn't managed to trace the\ncounterfeit bills back to a common area in Cincinnati, he'd never have\nbeen able to complete his part of the assignment. But it was nice to\nbe praised, anyhow. Malone felt a twinge of guilt, and told himself\nsternly to relax and enjoy himself.\n\n\"That's what I said,\" Burris told him. \"Relaxation.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I certainly would like a vacation, that's for\nsure. I'd like to snooze for a couple of weeks, or maybe go up to Cape\nCod for a while. There's a lot of nice scenery up around there. It's\nrestful, sort of, and I could just--\"\n\nHe stopped. Burris was frowning, and when Andrew J. Burris frowned it\nwas a good idea to look attentive, interested, and alert. \"Now,\nMalone,\" Burris said sadly, \"I wasn't exactly thinking about a\nvacation. You're not scheduled for one until August, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, Chief,\" Malone said. \"But I thought--\"\n\n\"Much as I'd like to,\" Burris said, \"I just can't make an exception;\nyou know that, Malone. I've got to go pretty much by the schedule.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said, feeling just a shade disappointed.\n\n\"But I do think you deserve a rest,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Well, if I--\"\n\n\"Here's what I'm going to do,\" Burris said, and paused. Malone felt a\nlittle unsure as to exactly what his chief was talking about, but by\nnow he knew better than to ask a lot of questions. Sooner or later,\nBurris would probably explain himself. And if he didn't, then there\nwas no use worrying about it. That was just the way Burris acted.\n\n\"Suppose I gave you a chance to take it easy for a while,\" Burris\nsaid. \"You could catch up on your sleep, see some shows, have a couple\nof drinks during the evening, take girls out for dinner--you know.\nSomething like that. How would you like it?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Malone said cautiously.\n\n\"Good,\" Burris said. \"I knew you would.\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, thought briefly and closed it again. After\nall, it did sound sort of promising, and if there was a catch in it\nhe'd find out about it soon enough.\n\n\"It's really just a routine case,\" Burris said in an offhand tone.\n\"Nothing to it.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"There's this red Cadillac,\" Burris said. \"It was stolen from a party\nin Connecticut, out near Danbury, and it showed up in New York City.\nNow, the car's crossed a state line.\"\n\n\"That puts it in our jurisdiction,\" Malone said, feeling obvious.\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said. \"Right on the nose.\"\n\n\"But the New York office--\"\n\n\"Naturally, they're in charge of everything,\" Burris said. \"But I'm\nsending you out as sort of a special observer. Just keep your eyes\nopen, and nose around and let me know what's happening.\"\n\n\"Keep my eyes and nose what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Open,\" Burris said. \"And let me know about it.\"\n\nMalone tried to picture himself with his eyes and nose open, and\ndecided he didn't look very attractive that way. Well, it was only a\nfigure of speech or something. He didn't have to think about it.\n\nIt really made a very ugly picture.\n\n\"But why a special observer?\" he said after a second. Burris could\nread the reports from the New York office, and probably get more facts\nthan any single agent could find out just wandering around a strange\ncity. It sounded as if there were something, Malone told himself, just\na tiny shade rotten in Denmark. It sounded as if there were going to\nbe something in the nice easy assignment he was getting that would\nmake him wish he'd gone lion hunting in Darkest Africa instead.\n\nAnd then again, maybe he was wrong. He stood at ease and waited to\nfind out.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"it is just a routine case. Just like I said. But\nthere seems to be something a little bit odd about it.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone said with a sinking feeling.\n\n\"Here's what happened,\" Burris said hurriedly, as if he were afraid\nMalone was going to change his mind and refuse the assignment. \"This\nred Cadillac I told you about was reported stolen from Danbury. Three\ndays later, it turned up in New York City--parked smack across the\nstreet from a precinct police station. Of course it took them a while\nto wake up, but one of the officers happened to notice the routine\nreport on stolen cars in the area, and he decided to go across the\nstreet and check the license number on the car. Then something funny\nhappened.\"\n\n\"Something funny?\" Malone asked. He doubted that, whatever it was, it\nwas going to make him laugh. But he kept his face a careful, receptive\nblank.\n\n\"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Now, if you're going to understand what\nhappened, you've got to get the whole picture.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Only that isn't what I mean,\" Burris added suddenly.\n\nMalone blinked. \"_What_ isn't what you mean?\" he said.\n\n\"Understanding what happened,\" Burris said. \"That's the trouble. You\nwon't understand what happened. I don't understand it, and neither\ndoes anybody else. So what do you think about it?\"\n\n\"Think about what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"About what I've been telling you,\" Burris snapped. \"This car.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"Well,\" he said, \"this officer went over to\ncheck the license plate. It seems like the right thing to do. It's\njust what I'd have done myself.\"\n\n\"Sure you would,\" Burris said. \"Anybody would. But listen to me.\"\n\n\"All right, Chief,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It was just after dawn--early in the morning.\" Malone wondered\nbriefly if there were parts of the world where dawn came, say, late in\nthe afternoon, or during the evening sometime, but he said nothing.\n\"The street was deserted,\" Burris went on. \"But it was pretty light\nout, and the witnesses are willing to swear that there was nobody on\nthat street for a block in either direction. Except them, of course.\"\n\n\"Except who?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Except the witnesses,\" Burris said patiently. \"Four cops, police\nofficers who were standing on the front steps of the precinct station,\ntalking. They were waiting to go on duty, or anyhow that's what the\nreport said. It's lucky they were there, for whatever reason; they're\nthe only witnesses we've got.\"\n\nBurris stopped. Malone waited a few seconds and then said, as calmly\nas he could, \"Witnesses to what?\"\n\n\"To this whole business with Sergeant Jukovsky,\" Burris said.\n\nThe sudden introduction of a completely new name confused Malone for\nan instant, but he recovered gamely. \"Sergeant Jukovsky was the man\nwho investigated the car,\" he said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Except that he didn't.\"\n\nMalone sighed.\n\n\"Those four officers--the witnesses--they weren't paying much\nattention to what looked like the routine investigation of a parked\ncar,\" Burris said. \"But here's their testimony. They were standing\naround talking when this Sergeant Jukovsky came out of the station,\nspoke to them in passing, and went on across the street. He didn't\nseem very worried or alarmed about anything.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said involuntarily. \"I mean, go on, Chief,\" he added.\n\n\"Ah,\" Burris said. \"All right. Well. According to Jukovsky, he took a\nlook at the plate and found the numbers checked the listing he had for\na stolen Connecticut car. Then he walked around to take a look inside\nthe car. It was empty. Get that, Malone. The car was empty.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"it was parked. I suppose parked cars are usually\nempty. What's special about this one?\"\n\n\"Wait and see,\" Burris said ominously. \"Jukovsky swears the car was\nempty. He tried the doors, and they were all locked but one, the front\ndoor on the curb side, the driver's door. So he opened it, and leaned\nover to have a look at the odometer to check the mileage. And\nsomething clobbered him on the back of the head.\"\n\n\"One of the other cops,\" Malone said.\n\n\"One of the--who?\" Burris said. \"No. Not the cops. Not at all.\"\n\n\"Then something fell on him,\" Malone said. \"Okay. Then whatever fell\non him ought to be--\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Yes, Chief?\"\n\n\"Jukovsky woke up on the sidewalk with the other cops all around him.\nThere was nothing on that sidewalk but Jukovsky. Nothing could have\nfallen on him; it hadn't landed anywhere, if you see what I mean.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Whatever it was,\" Burris said, \"they didn't find it. But that isn't\nthe peculiar thing.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No,\" Burris said slowly. \"Now--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"They looked on the sidewalk and around\nthere. But did they think to search the car?\"\n\n\"They didn't get a chance,\" Burris said. \"Anyhow, not then. Not until\nthey got around to picking up the pieces of the car uptown at 125th\nStreet.\"\n\nMalone closed his eyes. \"Where was this precinct?\" he said.\n\n\"Midtown,\" Burris said. \"In the forties.\"\n\n\"And the pieces of the car were eighty blocks away when they searched\nit?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded.\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said pleasantly. \"I give up.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Burris said. \"According to\nthe witnesses, after Jukovsky fell out of the car, the motor started\nand the car drove off uptown.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. He thought about that for a minute and decided at\nlast to hazard one little question. It sounded silly--but then, what\ndidn't? \"The car just drove off all by itself?\" he said.\n\nBurris seemed abashed. \"Well, Malone,\" he said carefully, \"that's\nwhere the conflicting stories of the eyewitnesses don't agree. You\nsee, two of the cops say there was nobody in the car. Nobody at all.\nOf any kind. Small or large.\"\n\n\"And the other two?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The other two swear they saw somebody at the wheel,\" Burris said,\n\"but they won't say whether it was a man, a woman, a small child, or\nan anthropoid ape. And they haven't the faintest idea where he, she,\nor it came from.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. He felt a little tired. This trip was beginning\nto sound less and less like a vacation.\n\n\"Those two cops swear there was something--or somebody--driving the\ncar,\" Burris said. \"And that isn't all.\"\n\n\"It isn't?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris shook his head. \"A couple of the cops jumped into a squad car\nand started following the red Cadillac. One of these cops saw somebody\nin the car when it left the curb. The other one didn't. Got that?\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" Malone said, \"but I don't exactly know what to do with\nit.\"\n\n\"Just hold on to it,\" Burris said, \"and listen to this. The cops were\nabout two blocks behind at the start, and they couldn't close the gap\nright away. The Cadillac headed west and climbed up the ramp of the\nWest Side Highway, heading north, out toward Westchester. I'd give a\nlot to know where they were going, too.\"\n\n\"But they crashed,\" Malone said, remembering that the pieces were at\n125th Street. \"So--\"\n\n\"They didn't crash right away,\" Burris said. \"The prowl car started\ngaining on the Cadillac slowly. And--now, get this, Malone--both the\ncops swear there _was_ somebody in the driver's seat now.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"One of these cops didn't see anybody at\nall in the driver's seat when the car started off.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said.\n\n\"But on the West Side Highway, he did see a driver,\" Malone said. He\nthought for a minute. \"Hell, it could happen. They took off so fast he\ncould have been confused, or something.\"\n\n\"There's another explanation,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"We're all crazy. The whole world is\ncrazy.\"\n\n\"Not that one,\" Burris said. \"I'll tell you when I finish with this\nthing about the car itself. There isn't much description of whoever or\nwhatever was driving that car on the West Side Highway, by the way. In\ncase you were thinking of asking.\"\n\nMalone, who hadn't been thinking of asking anything, tried to look\nclever. Burris regarded him owlishly for a second, and then went on:\n\n\"The car was hitting it up at about a hundred and ten by this time,\nand accelerating all the time. But the souped-up squad car was coming\non fast, too, and it was quite a chase. Luckily, there weren't many\ncars on the road. Somebody could have been killed, Malone.\"\n\n\"Like the driver of the Cadillac,\" Malone ventured.\n\nBurris looked pained. \"Not exactly,\" he said. \"Because the car hit the\n125th Street exit like a bomb. It swerved right, just as though it\nwere going to take the exit and head off somewhere, but it was going\nmuch too fast by that time. There just wasn't any way to maneuver. The\nCadillac hit the embankment, flipped over the edge, and smashed. It\ncaught fire almost at once. Of course the prowl car braked fast and\nwent down the exit after it. But there wasn't anything to do.\"\n\n\"That's what I said,\" Malone said. \"The driver of the Cadillac was\nkilled. In a fire like that--\"\n\n\"Don't jump to conclusions, Malone,\" Burris said. \"Wait. When the\nprowl car boys got to the scene, there was no sign of anybody in the\ncar. Nobody at all.\"\n\n\"In the heat of those flames--\" Malone began.\n\n\"Not enough heat, and not enough time,\" Burris said. \"A human body\ncouldn't have been destroyed in just a few minutes, not that\ncompletely. Some of the car's metal was melted, sure; but there would\nhave been traces of anybody who'd been in the car. Nice, big, easily\nseen traces. And there weren't any. No corpse, no remains, no\nnothing.\"\n\nMalone let that stew in his mind for a few seconds. \"But the cops\nsaid--\"\n\n\"Whatever the cops said,\" Burris snapped, \"there was nobody at all in\nthat Cadillac when it went off the embankment.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Here's a car with a driver who\nappears and disappears practically at will. Sometimes he's there and\nsometimes he's not there.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Burris said. \"That's why I have another explanation.\"\n\nMalone shifted his feet. Maybe there _was_ another explanation. But,\nhe told himself, it would have to be a good one.\n\n\"Nobody expects a car to drive itself down a highway,\" Burris said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"That's why it's all impossible.\"\n\n\"So,\" Burris said, \"it would be a natural hallucination--or illusion,\nanyhow--for somebody to imagine he did see a driver when there wasn't\nany.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"There wasn't any driver. So the car couldn't\nhave gone anywhere. So the New York police force is lying to us. It's\na good explanation, but it--\"\n\n\"They aren't lying,\" Burris said. \"Why should they? I'm thinking of\nsomething else.\" He stopped, his eyes bright as he leaned across the\ndesk toward Malone.\n\n\"Do I get three guesses?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris ignored him. \"Frankly,\" he said, \"I've got a hunch that the\nwhole thing was done with remote control. Somewhere in that car was a\nvery cleverly concealed device that was capable of running the\nCadillac from a distance.\"\n\nIt did sound plausible, Malone thought. \"Did the prowl car boys find\nany traces of it when they examined the wreckage?\" he said.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" Burris said. \"But, after all, it could have been\nmelted. The fire did destroy a lot of the Cadillac, and there's just\nno telling. But I'd give long odds that there must have been some kind\nof robot device in that car. It's the only answer, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burns said, his voice filled with Devotion To One's Country\nIn The Face of Great Obstacles, \"Malone, I want you to find that\ndevice!\"\n\n\"In the wreck?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris sighed and leaned back. \"No,\" he said. \"Of course not. Not in\nthe wreck. But the other red Cadillacs--some of them, anyhow--ought to\nhave--\"\n\n\"What red Cadillacs?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The other ones that have been stolen. From Connecticut, mostly. One\nfrom New Jersey, out near Passaic.\"\n\n\"Have any of the others been moving around without drivers?\" Malone\nsaid.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"there's been no report of it. But who can tell?\"\nHe gestured with both arms. \"Anything is possible, Malone.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Now,\" Burris said, \"all of the stolen cars are red 1972 Cadillacs.\nThere's got to be some reason for that. I think they're covering up\nanother car like the one that got smashed: a remote-controlled\nCadillac. Or even a self-guiding, automatic, robot-controlled\nCadillac.\"\n\n\"They?\" Malone said. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Whoever is stealing the cars,\" Burris said patiently.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure. But--\"\n\n\"So get up to New York,\" Burris said, \"keep your eyes open, and nose\naround. Got it?\"\n\n\"I have now,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And when that Cadillac is found, Malone, we want to take a look at\nit. Okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nOf course there were written reports, too. Burris had handed Malone a\nsheaf of them--copies of the New York police reports to Burris\nhimself--and Malone, wanting some time to look through them, had taken\na train to New York instead of a plane. Besides, the new planes still\nmade him slightly nervous, though he could ride one when he had to. If\njet engines had been good enough for the last generation, he thought,\nthey were certainly good enough for him.\n\nBut avoidance of the new planes was all the good the train trip did\nhim. The reports contained thousands of words, none of which was\neither new or, apparently, significant to Malone. Burris, he\nconsidered, had given him everything necessary for the job.\n\nExcept, of course, a way to make sense out of the whole thing. He\nconsidered robot-controlled Cadillacs. What good were they? They might\nmake it easier for the average driver, of course--but that was no\nreason to cover up for them, hitting policemen over the head and\nsmashing cars and driving a hundred and ten miles an hour on the West\nSide Highway.\n\nAll the same, it was the only explanation Malone had, and he cherished\nit deeply. He put the papers back in his brief case when the train\npulled into Penn Station, handed his suitcases to a redcap and punched\nthe buttons for the waiting room. Now, he thought as he strolled\nslowly along behind the robot, there was an invention that made sense.\nAnd nobody had to get killed for it, or hit over the head or smashed\nup, had they?\n\nSo what was all this nonsense about robot-controlled red Cadillacs?\n\nDriving these unwelcome reflections from his mind, he paused to light\na cigarette. He had barely taken the first puff when a familiar voice\nsaid, \"Hey, buddy, hold the light, will you?\"\n\nMalone looked up, blinked and grinned happily. \"Boyd!\" he said. \"What\nare you doing here? I haven't seen you since--\"\n\n\"Sure haven't,\" Boyd said. \"I've been out West on a couple of cases.\nMust be a year since we worked together.\"\n\n\"Just about,\" Malone said. \"But what are you doing in New York?\nVacationing?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Boyd said. \"The chief called it sort of a vacation,\nbut--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"You re working with me.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"The chief sent me up. When I got back from the West, he\nsuddenly decided you might need a good assistant, so I took the plane\ndown, and got here ahead of you.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. \"But I want to warn you about the vacation--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Boyd said; just a shade sadly. \"I know. It isn't.\" He\nseemed deep in thought, as if he were deciding whether or not to get\nrid of Anne Boleyn. It was, Malone thought, an unusually apt simile.\nBoyd, six feet tall and weighing about two hundred and twenty-five\npounds, had a large square face and a broad-beamed figure that might\nhave made him a dead ringer for Henry VIII of England even without his\nHenry-like fringe of beard and his mustache. With them--thanks to the\nrecent FBI rule that agents could wear \"facial hair, at the discretion\nof the director or such board as he may appoint\"--the resemblance to\nthe Tudor monarch was uncanny.\n\nBut, like his famous double, Boyd didn't stay sad for long. \"I thought\nI'd meet you at the station,\" he said, cheering up, \"and maybe talk\nover old times for a while, on the way to the hotel, anyhow. So long\nas there wasn't anything else to do.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"It's good to see you again. And when did you get\npulled out of the Frisco office?\"\n\nBoyd grimaced. \"You know,\" he said, \"I had a good thing going for me\nout there. Agent-in-Charge of the entire office. But right after that\njob we did together--the Queen Elizabeth affair--Burris decided I was\ntoo good a man to waste my fragrance on the desert air. Or whatever it\nis. So he recalled me, assigned me from the home office, and I've been\non one case after another ever since.\"\n\n\"You're a home-office agent now?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'm a Roving Reporter,\" Boyd said, and struck a pose. \"I'm a General\nTrouble-shooter and a Mr. Fix-It. Just like you, Hero.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"How about the local office here? Seen the boys\nyet?\"\n\nBoyd shook his head. \"Not yet,\" he said. \"I was waiting for you to\nshow up. But I did manage hotel rooms--a couple of rooms with a\nconnecting bath over at the Hotel New Yorker. Nice place. You'll like\nit, Ken.\"\n\n\"I'll love it,\" Malone said. \"Especially that connecting bath. It\nwould have been terrible to have an unconnecting bath. Sort of\ndistracting.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Boyd said. \"Okay. You know what I mean.\" He stared down at\nMalone's hand. \"You know you've still got your lighter on?\" he added.\n\nMalone looked down at it and shut it off. \"You asked me to hold it,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I didn't mean indefinitely,\" Boyd said. \"Anyhow, how about grabbing a\ncab and heading on down to the hotel to get your stuff away, before we\ncheck in at 69th Street?\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" Malone said. \"And besides, I could do with a clean shirt.\nNot to mention a bath.\"\n\n\"Trains get worse and worse,\" Boyd said absently.\n\nMalone punched the redcap's buttons again, and he and Boyd followed it\nthrough the crowded station to the taxi stand. The robot piled the\nsuitcases into the cab, and somehow Malone and Boyd found room for\nthemselves.\n\n\"Hotel New Yorker,\" Boyd said grandly.\n\nThe driver swung around to stare at them, blinked, and finally said,\n\"Okay, Mac. You said it.\" He started with a terrific grinding of\ngears, drove out of the Penn Station arch and went two blocks.\n\n\"Here you are, Mac,\" he said, stopping the cab.\n\nMalone stared at Boyd with a reproachful expression.\n\n\"So how was I to know?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I didn't look. If I'd known it was so close we could've walked.\"\n\n\"And saved half a buck,\" Malone said. \"But don't let it bother\nyou--this is expense-account money.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Boyd said. He beamed and tipped the driver heavily.\nThe cab drove off and Malone hailed the New Yorker doorman, who\nequipped them with a robot bellhop and sent them upstairs to their\nrooms.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later, Boyd and Malone were in the offices\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on East 69th Street. There\nthey picked up a lot of nice, new, shiny facts. It was unfortunate, if\nnot particularly surprising, that the facts did not seem to make any\nsense.\n\nIn the first place, only red 1972 Cadillacs seemed to be involved.\nAnybody who owned such a car was likely to find it missing at any\ntime; there had been a lot of thefts reported, including some that\nhadn't had time to get into Burris' reports. New Jersey now claimed\ntwo victims, and New York had three of its own.\n\nAnd all the cars weren't turning up in New York, by any means. Some of\nthe New York cars had turned up in New Jersey. Some had turned up in\nConnecticut--including one of the New Jersey cars. So far, there had\nbeen neither thefts nor discoveries in Pennsylvania, but Malone\ncouldn't see why.\n\nThere was absolutely no pattern that he, Boyd, or anyone else could\nfind. The list of thefts and recoveries had been fed into an\nelectronic calculator, which had neatly regurgitated them without\nbeing in the least helpful. It had remarked that the square of seven\nwas forty-nine, but this was traced to a defect in the mechanism.\n\nWhoever was borrowing the red Caddies exhibited a peculiar combination\nof burglarious genius and what looked to Malone like outright idiocy.\nThis was plainly impossible.\n\nUnfortunately, it had happened.\n\nLocking the car doors didn't do a bit of good. The thief, or thieves,\ngot in without so much as scratching the lock. This obviously proved\nthat the criminal was either an extremely good lock-pick or else knew\nwhere to get duplicate keys.\n\nHowever, the ignition was invariably shorted across.\n\nThis proved neatly that the criminal was not a very good lock-pick,\nand did not know where to get duplicate keys.\n\nQuery: Why work so hard on the doors, and not work at all on the\nignition?\n\nThat was the first place. The second place was just what had been\nbothering Malone all along. There didn't seem to be any purpose to the\ncar thefts. They hadn't been sold, or used as getaway cars. True,\nteenage delinquents sometimes stole cars just to use them joy-riding,\nor as some sort of prank.\n\nBut a car or two every night? How many joy-rides can one gang take?\nMalone thought. And how long does it take to get tired of the same\nprank?\n\nAnd why, Malone asked himself wearily for what was beginning to feel\nlike the ten thousandth time, why only red Cadillacs?\n\nBurris, he told himself, must have been right all along. The red\nCadillacs were only a smoke screen for something else. Perhaps it was\nthe robot car, perhaps not; but whatever it was, Burris' general\nanswer was the only one that made any sense at all.\n\nThat should have been a comforting thought, Malone reflected. Somehow,\nthough, it wasn't.\n\nAfter they'd finished with the files and personnel at 69th Street,\nMalone and Boyd started downtown on what turned out to be a sort of\nunguided tour of the New York Police Department. They spoke to some of\nthe eyewitnesses, and ended up in Centre Street asking a lot of\nreasonably useless questions in the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. In\ngeneral, they spent nearly six hours on the Affair of the\nSelf-Propelled Cadillac, picking up a whole bundle of facts. Some of\nthe facts they had already known. Some were new, but unhelpful.\n\nSomehow, nobody felt much like going out for a night on the town.\nInstead both agents climbed wearily into bed, thinking morose and\ndisillusioned thoughts.\n\nAnd, after that, a week passed. It was filled with ennui.\n\nOnly one new thing became clear. In spite of the almost identical\nmodus operandi used in all the car thefts, they were obviously the\nwork of a gang rather than a single person. This required the\nassumption that there was not one insane man at work, but a crew of\nthem, all identically unbalanced.\n\n\"But the jobs are just too scattered to be the work of one man,\"\nMalone said. \"To steal a car in Connecticut and drive it to the Bronx,\nand then steal another car in Westfield, New Jersey, fifteen minutes\nlater takes more than talent. It takes an outright for-sure magician.\"\n\nThis conclusion, while interesting, was not really helpful. The fact\nwas that Malone needed more clues--or, anyhow, more facts--before he\ncould do anything at all. And there just weren't any new facts around.\nHe spent the week wandering morosely from one place to another\nsometimes accompanied by Thomas Boyd and sometimes all alone. Time, he\nknew, was ticking by at its usual rate. But there wasn't a thing he\ncould do about it.\n\nHe did try to relax and have some fun, as Burris had suggested. But he\ndidn't seem to be able to get his mind off the case.\n\nBoyd, after the first little while, had no such trouble. He entered\nthe social life of the city with a whoop of joy and disappeared from\nsight. That was fine for Boyd, Malone reflected, but it did leave\nMalone himself just a little bit at loose ends.\n\nNot that he begrudged Boyd his fun. It was nice that one of them was\nenjoying himself, anyway.\n\nIt was just that Malone was beginning to get fidgety. He needed to be\ndoing something--even if it was only taking a walk.\n\nSo he took a walk and ended up, to his own surprise, downtown near\nGreenwich Village.\n\nAnd then he'd been bopped on the head.\n\n\n                                  3\n\nThe patrol car pulled up in front of St. Vincent's Hospital, and one\nof the cops helped Malone into the emergency receiving room. He didn't\nfeel as bad as he had a few minutes before. The motion of the car\nhadn't helped any, but his head seemed to be knitting a little, and\nhis legs were a little steadier. True, he didn't feel one hundred per\ncent healthy, but he was beginning to think he might live, after all.\nAnd while the doctor was bandaging his head, a spirit of new life\nbegan to fill the FBI agent.\n\nHe was no longer morose and undirected. He had a purpose in life, and\nthe purpose filled him with cold determination. He was going to find\nthe robot-operated car--or whatever it turned out to be.\n\nThe doctor, Malone noticed, was whistling _Greensleeves_ under his\nbreath as he worked. That, he supposed, was the influence of the\nBohemian folk-singers of Greenwich Village. But he put the noise\nresolutely out of his mind and concentrated on the red Cadillac.\n\nIt was one thing to think about a robot car miles away, doing\nsomething or other to somebody you'd never heard of before. That was\njust theoretical, a case for solution, nothing but an ordinary job.\n\nBut when the car stepped up and bopped Malone himself on the head, it\nbecame a personal matter. Now Malone had more than a job to contend\nwith. Now he was thinking about revenge.\n\n_By God_, he told himself, _no car in the world--not even a\nCadillac--can get away with beaning Kenneth J. Malone!_\n\nMalone was not quite certain that he agreed with Burris' idea of a\nself-operating car, but at least it was something to work on. A car\nthat could reach out, crown an investigator, and then drive off\nhumming something innocent under its breath was certainly a unique and\ndangerous machine within the meaning of the act. Of course, there were\nproblems attendant on this view of things. For one thing, Malone\ncouldn't quite see how the car could have beaned him when he was ten\nfeet away from it. But that was, he told himself uncomfortably, a\nminor point. He could deal with it when he felt a little better.\n\nThe important thing was the car itself. Malone jerked a little under\nthe doctor's calm hands, and swore subvocally.\n\n\"Hold still,\" the doctor said. \"Don't go wiggling your head around\nthat way. Just wait quietly until the dermijel sets.\"\n\nObediently, Malone froze. There was a crick in his neck, but he\ndecided he could stand it. \"My head still hurts,\" he said accusingly.\n\n\"Sure it still hurts,\" the doctor agreed.\n\n\"But you--\"\n\n\"What did you expect?\" the doctor said. \"Even an FBI agent isn't\nimmune to blackjacks, you know.\" He resumed his work on Malone's\nskull.\n\n\"Blackjacks?\" Malone said. \"What blackjacks?\"\n\n\"The ones that hit you,\" the doctor said. \"Or the one, anyhow.\"\n\nMalone blinked. Somehow, though he could manage a fuzzy picture of a\ncar reaching out to hit him, the introduction of a blackjack into this\nimaginative effort confused things a little. But he resolutely ignored\nit.\n\n\"The bruise is just the right size and shape,\" the doctor said. \"And\nthat cut on your head comes from the seams on the leather casing.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\" Malone said doubtfully. It did seem as if a car had a\nlot more dangerous weapons around, without resorting to blackjacks. If\nit had really wanted to damage him, why hadn't it hit him with the\nengine block?\n\n\"I'm sure,\" the doctor said. \"I've worked in Emergency in this\nhospital long enough to recognize a blackjack wound.\"\n\nThat was a disturbing idea, in a way. It gave a new color to Malone's\nreflection on Greenwich Villagers. Maybe things had changed since he'd\nheard about them. Maybe the blackjack had supplanted the guitar.\n\nBut that wasn't the important thing.\n\nThe fact that it had been a blackjack that had hit him _was_\nimportant. It was vital, as a matter of fact. Malone knew that\nperfectly well. It was a key fact in the case he was investigating.\n\nThe only trouble was that he didn't see what, if anything, it meant.\n\nThe doctor stepped back and regarded Malone's head with something like\npride. \"There,\" he said. \"You'll be all right now.\"\n\n\"A concussion?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the doctor said. \"But it isn't serious. Just take these\npills--one every two hours until they're gone--and you'll be rid of\nany effects within twenty-four hours.\" He went to a cabinet, fiddled\naround for a minute, and came back with a small bottle containing six\norange pills. They looked very large and threatening.\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said doubtfully.\n\n\"You'll be all right,\" the doctor said, giving Malone a cheerful,\nconfident grin. \"Nothing at all to worry about.\" He loaded a hypojet\nand blasted something through the skin of Malone's upper arm. Malone\nswallowed hard. He knew perfectly well that he hadn't felt a thing but\nhe couldn't quite make himself believe it.\n\n\"That'll take care of you for tonight,\" the doctor said. \"Get some\nsleep and start in on the pills when you wake up, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. It was going to make waking up something less\nthan a pleasure, but he wanted to get well, didn't he?\n\nOf course he did. If that Cadillac thought it was going to beat him...\n\n\"You can stand up now,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said, trying it. \"Thanks, Doctor. I--\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door. The doctor jerked his head around.\n\n\"Who's that?\" he said.\n\n\"Me,\" a bass voice said, unhelpfully.\n\nThe emergency-room door opened a crack and a face peered in. It took\nMalone a second to recognize Bill, the waffle-faced cop who had picked\nhim up next to the lamp post three years or so before. \"Long time no\nsee,\" Malone said at random.\n\n\"What?\" Bill said, and opened the door wider. He came in and closed it\nbehind him. \"It's okay, Doc,\" he said to the attendant. \"I'm a cop.\"\n\n\"Been hurt?\" the doctor said.\n\nBill shook his head. \"Not recently,\" he said. \"I came to see this\nguy.\" He looked at Malone. \"They told me you were still here,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Who's they?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Outside,\" Bill said. \"The attendants out there. They said you were\nstill getting stitched up.\"\n\n\"And quite right, too,\" Malone said solemnly.\n\n\"Oh,\" Bill said. \"Sure.\" He fished in his pockets. \"You dropped your\nnotebook, though, and I came to give it back to you.\" He located the\nobject he was hunting for and brought it out with the triumphant\ngesture of a man displaying the head of a dragon he had slain. \"Here,\"\nhe said, waving the book.\n\n\"Notebook?\" Malone said. He stared at it. It was a small looseleaf\nbook bound in cheap black plastic.\n\n\"We found it in the gutter,\" Bill said.\n\nMalone took a tentative step forward and managed not to fall. He\nstepped back again and looked at Bill scornfully. \"I wasn't even in\nthe gutter,\" he said. \"There are limits.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Bill said. \"But the notebook was, so I brought it along to\nyou. I thought you might need it or something.\" He handed it over to\nMalone with a flourish.\n\nIt wasn't Malone's notebook. In the first place, he had never owned a\nnotebook that looked anything like that, and in the second place he\nhadn't had any notebooks on him when he went for his walk. _Mine not\nto question why_, Malone told himself with a shrug, and flipped the\nbook open.\n\nAt once he saw why the cop had mistaken it for his.\n\nIt had his name in it.\n\nOn the very first page were two names, written out in a careful,\nsemieducated scrawl:\n\n     _Mr. Kenneth J. Malone, FBI_\n     _Lt. Peter Lynch, NYPD_\n\nThe rest of the page was blank. Malone wondered who Lieutenant Lynch\nwas, and made a mental note to find out. Then he wondered what his\nname was doing in somebody else's notebook. Maybe, he thought, it was\na list of people to slug, and the car had made it up. But he hadn't\nheard of anybody named Lynch being hit on the head by a marauding\nautomobile, and he couldn't quite picture a Cadillac jotting things\ndown in a notebook for future reference. Besides, he had an idea that\na Cadillac's handwriting would be more formal, and prettier.\n\nHe turned the page. On the next leaf there were more names, eight of\nthem. The first one was written in red pencil and the others were in\nordinary black. Malone stared at them:\n\n     _Mike F._\n     _Ramon O._\n     _Mario G._\n     _Silvo E._\n     _Alvarez A._\n     _Felipe la B._\n     _Juan de los S._\n     _Ray del E._\n\nAll the names except Mike F. sounded Spanish, or possibly Puerto\nRican. Malone wondered who they were. Juvenile delinquents? Other\npeople to slug? Police officers?\n\nMaybe they were all the names of Spanish-speaking Cadillacs.\n\nHe blinked and rubbed at his forehead with one hand. His head still\nhurt, and that was probably why he was getting such strange ideas. It\nwas obvious that, whatever the notebook was, it hadn't been written by\nan automobile.\n\nHe turned the page again.\n\nHere there was a carefully detailed drawing of a car. Malone\nrecognized it as a 1972 Cadillac without any effort at all.\n\nAnd it had been carefully colored in with red pencil.\n\nWow, Malone asked himself, _What the hell does that mean?_\n\nHe couldn't find an answer. He turned the page, hoping for some more\nfacts that might make some sense out of what he had been seeing, but\nthere was nothing more. All the rest of the pages in the notebook were\nblank.\n\nHe looked up at the cop and the doctor with a bland, blank face.\n\"Thanks a lot,\" he told Bill. \"I thought I'd lost this book. I\nappreciate it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's okay, Mr. Malone,\" Bill said. \"Glad to do it.\"\n\n\"You don't know what this means to me,\" Malone said truthfully.\n\n\"No trouble at all,\" Bill said. \"Any time.\" He gave Malone a big smile\nand turned back to the door. \"But I got to get back to my beat,\" he\nsaid. \"Listen, I'll see you. And if I can be any help--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"I'll let you know. And thanks again.\"\n\n\"Welcome,\" Bill said, and opened the door. He strode out with the air\nof a man who has just been decorated with the Silver Star, the Purple\nHeart and the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nMalone tried a few more steps and discovered that he could walk\nwithout falling down. He thanked the doctor again.\n\n\"Perfectly all right,\" the doctor said. \"Nothing to it. Why, you ought\nto see some of the cases we get here. There was a guy here the other\nnight with both his legs all mashed up by a--\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"Well, I've got to be on my way.\nJust send the bill to FBI headquarters on 69th Street.\" He closed the\ndoor on the doctor's enthusiastic \"Yes, _sir!_\" and went on down the\nhallway and out into the street. At Seventh Avenue and Greenwich\nAvenue he flagged a cab.\n\nIt was a hell of a place to be, Malone thought as the cab drove away.\nWhere but in Greenwich Village did avenues intersect each other\nwithout so much as a by-your-leave?\n\n\"Hotel New Yorker,\" he said, giving the whole thing up as a bad job.\nHe put his hat on his head and adjusted it painfully to the proper\nangle.\n\nAnd that, he thought, made another little problem. The car had not\nonly hit him on the head, it had removed his hat before doing so, and\nthen replaced it. It had only fallen off when he'd started to get up\nagainst the lamp post.\n\n_A nice quiet vacation_, Malone thought bitterly.\n\nHe fumed in silence all the way to the hotel, through the lobby, up in\nthe elevator, and to the door of his room. Then he remembered the\nnotebook.\n\nThat was important evidence. He decided to tell Boyd about it right\naway.\n\nHe went into the bathroom and tapped gently on the door to Boyd's\nconnecting room. The door swung open.\n\nBoyd, apparently, was still out painting the town--Malone considered\nthe word _red_ and dropped the whole phrase with a sigh. At any rate,\nhis partner was nowhere in the room.\n\n\"The hell with it,\" Malone announced loudly to no one in particular.\nHe went back into his own room, closed the door, and got wearily ready\nfor bed.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nDawn came, and then daylight, and then a lot more daylight. It was\nstreaming in through the windows with careless abandon, filling the\nroom with a lot of bright sunshine and the muggy heat of the city.\nFrom the street below, the cheerful noises of traffic and pedestrians\nfloated up and filled Malone's ears.\n\nHe got up, turned over in bed, and tried to go back to sleep.\n\nBut sleep wouldn't come. After a long time he gave up, and swung\nhimself over the edge of the bed. Standing up was a delicate job, but\nhe managed it, feeling rather proud of himself in a dim, semiconscious\nsort of way.\n\nHe went into the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and then opened the\nconnecting door to Boyd's room softly.\n\nBoyd was home. He lay in a great tangle of bedclothes, snoring\nhideously and making little motions with his hands and arms like a\nbeached whale. Malone padded over to him and dug him fiercely in the\nribs.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"Wake up, Tommy-boy.\"\n\nBoyd's eyes did not open. In a voice as hollow as a zombie's, he said,\n\"My head hurts.\"\n\n\"Can't feel any worse than mine,\" Malone said cheerily. This, he\nreflected, was not quite true. Considering everything it had been\nthrough recently, his head felt remarkably like its old carefree self.\n\"You'll feel better once you're awake.\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" Boyd said simply. He jammed his head under a pillow and\nbegan to snore again. It was an awesome sound, like a man strangling\nto death in chicken fat. Malone sighed and poked at random among the\nbedclothes.\n\nBoyd swore distantly, and Malone poked him again.\n\n\"The sun is up,\" Malone said, \"and all the little pedestrians are\nchirping. It is time to rise.\"\n\nBoyd said, \"Gah,\" and withdrew his head from the pillow. Gently, as if\nhe were afraid he were going to fall apart, he rose to a sitting\nposition. When he had arrived at it, he opened his eyes.\n\n\"Now,\" Malone said. \"Isn't that better?\"\n\nBoyd closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said.\n\n\"Come on,\" Malone said. \"We've got to be up and moving.\"\n\n\"I'm up,\" Boyd said. His eyes flickered open. \"But I can't move,\" he\nadded. \"We had quite a time last night.\"\n\n\"We?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Me, and a couple of girls, and another guy. Just people I met.\" Boyd\nstarted to stand up and thought better of it. \"Just having a good\ntime, that's, all.\"\n\nMalone thought of reading his partner a lecture on the Evils of Drink,\nand decided against it. Boyd might remember it, and use it against him\nsometime. Then he realized what had to be done. He went back into his\nown room, dialed for room service, and ordered a couple of pots of\nstrong black coffee.\n\nBy the time a good deal of that was awash in Boyd's intestinal system,\nhe was almost capable of rational, connected conversation. He filled\nhimself to the eyebrows with aspirins and other remedies, and actually\nsucceeded in getting dressed. He seemed quite proud of this feat.\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"Now we have to go downstairs.\"\n\n\"You mean outside?\" Boyd said. \"Into all that noise?\" He winced.\n\n\"Bite the bullet,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"Keep a stiff upper lip.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Boyd said, hunting for his coat with a doleful air. \"Have\nyou ever seen anybody with a loose upper lip?\"\n\nMalone, busy with his own coat, didn't bother with a reply. He managed\nsomehow to get Boyd downstairs and bundled into a cab. They headed for\n69th Street. There he made several phone calls. The first, of course,\nwas to Burris in Washington. After that he got the New York Police\nCommissioner on the wire and, finding that he needed still more\nauthority, he called the mayor and then, by long-distance to Albany,\nthe governor.\n\nBut by noon he had everything straightened out. He had a plan fully\nworked out in his mind, and he had the authority to go ahead with it.\nNow, he could make his final call.\n\n\"They're completely trustworthy,\" Burris had told him. \"Not only that,\nbut they have a clearance for this kind of special work--we've needed\nthem before.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not only that,\" Burris told him. \"They're damned good men. Maybe\namong the best in their field.\"\n\nSo Malone made his last call, to the firm of Leibowitz and Hardin,\nElectronic Engineers.\n\nThen he beckoned to Boyd.\n\n\"I don't see what I've been sitting around here for, all this time,\"\nhis partner complained. \"I could have been home sleeping until you\nneeded me.\"\n\n\"I need you now,\" Malone said. \"I want you to take over part of this\nplan.\"\n\nBoyd nodded sourly. \"Oh, all right,\" he said.\n\n\"Here's what I want,\" Malone said. \"Every red 1972 Cadillac in the\narea is to be picked up for inspection. I don't care why--make up a\nreason. A general traffic check. Anything you please. You can work\nthat end of it out with the commissioner; he knows about it and he's\nwilling to go along.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Boyd said. \"Do you have any idea how many cars there are in a\ncity this size?\"\n\n\"Well, we don't want all of them,\" Malone said. \"Only red 1972\nCadillacs.\"\n\n\"It's still a lot,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"If there were only three,\" Malone said, \"we wouldn't have any\nproblems.\"\n\n\"And wouldn't that be nice?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said, \"but it isn't true. Anyhow, I want every one of\nthose cars checked for any oddity, no matter how small. If there's an\ninch-long scratch on one fender, I want to know about it. If you've\ngot to take the cars apart, then do that.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Boyd said. \"All by myself?\"\n\n\"My God, no,\" Malone said. \"Use your head. There'll be a team working\nwith you. Let me explain it. Every nut, every bolt, every inch of\nthose cars has to be examined thoroughly--got it?\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" Boyd said, \"but I'm damned if I like it. After all,\nMalone--\"\n\nMalone ignored him. \"The governor of New York's promised his\ncooperation,\" he said, \"and he said he'd get in touch with the\ngovernors of New Jersey and Connecticut and get cooperation from that\nangle. So we'll have both state and local police working with us.\"\n\n\"That's a help,\" Boyd said. \"We'll make such a happy team of workmen.\nSinging as we pull the cars apart through the long day and night\nand--listen, Malone, when do you want reports on this?\"\n\n\"Yesterday,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd's eyebrows raised, then lowered. \"Great,\" he said dully.\n\n\"I don't care how you get the cars,\" Malone said. \"If you've got to,\ncondemn 'em. But get every last one of them. And bring them over to\nLeibowitz and Hardin for a complete checkup. I'll give you the\naddress.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"Glad to be of help. And don't worry; I'll\nhave other work to do.\" He paused, and then went on, \"I talked to Dr.\nIsaac Leibowitz--he's the head of the firm out there--and he says--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Boyd said. \"What?\"\n\n\"You mean I don't have to take the cars apart myself? You mean this\nLeibowitz and Hardin, or whatever it is, will do it for me?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said wearily. \"You're not an auto technician or an\nelectronics man. You're an agent of the FBI.\"\n\n\"I was beginning to wonder,\" Boyd said. \"After all.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Malone said doggedly, \"I talked to Leibowitz, and he says he\ncan give a car a complete check in about six hours, normally.\"\n\n\"Six hours?\" Boyd stared. \"That's going to take forever,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, he can set up a kind of assembly-line process and  turn out a\ncar every fifteen minutes. Any better?\"\n\nBoyd nodded.\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"There can't be so many 1972 red Cadillacs in the\narea that we can't get through them all at that speed.\" He thought a\nminute and then added, \"By the way, you might check with the Cadillac\ndealers around town, and find out just how many have been sold to\npeople living in the area.\"\n\n\"And while I'm doing all that,\" Boyd said, \"what are you going to be\ndoing?\"\n\nMalone looked at him and sighed. \"I'll worry about that,\" he said.\n\"Just get started.\"\n\n\"Suppose Leibowitz can't find anything?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"If Leibowitz can't find it, it's not there,\" Malone said. \"He can\nfind electronic devices anywhere in any car made, he says--even if\nthey're printed circuits hidden under the paint job.\"\n\n\"Pretty good,\" Boyd said. \"But suppose he doesn't?\"\n\n\"Then they aren't there,\" Malone said, \"and we'll have to think of\nsomething else.\" He considered that. It sounded fine. Only he wished\nhe knew what else there was to think of.\n\nWell, that was just pessimism. Leibowitz would find something, and the\ncase would be over, and he could go back to Washington and rest. In\nAugust he was going to have his vacation anyway, and August wasn't\nvery far away.\n\nMalone put a smile carefully on his face and told Boyd, \"Get going.\"\nHe slammed his hat on his head.\n\nWincing, he took it off and replaced it gently. The bottle of pills\nwas still in his pocket, but he wasn't due for another one just yet.\n\nHe had time to go over to the precinct station in the West Eighties\nfirst. He headed outside to get another taxi.\n\n\n                                  4\n\nThe door didn't say anything at all except _Lt. P. Lynch_. Malone\nlooked at it for a couple of seconds. He'd asked the desk sergeant for\nLynch, shown his credentials and been directed up a set of stairs and\naround a hall. But he still didn't know what Lynch did, who he was, or\nwhat his name was doing in the little black notebook.\n\nWell, he told himself, there was only one way to find out.\n\nHe opened the door.\n\nThe room was small and dark. It had a single desk in it, and three\nchairs, and a hatrack. There wasn't any coat or hat on the hatrack,\nand there was nobody in the chairs. In a fourth chair, behind the\ndesk, sat a huskily built man. He had steel-gray hair, a hard jaw and,\nMalone noticed with surprise, a faint twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Lieutenant Lynch?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Right,\" Lynch said. \"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"I'm Kenneth J. Malone, FBI.\" He reached for his wallet and found it.\nHe flipped it open for Lynch, who stared at it for what seemed a long,\nlong time, and then burst into laughter.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Malone asked. Lynch laughed some more.\n\n\"Oh, come on,\" Malone said bitterly. \"After all, there's no reason to\ntreat an FBI agent like some kind of a--\"\n\n\"FBI agent?\" Lynch said. \"Listen, buster, this is the funniest gag\nI've seen since I came on the force. Really a hell of a funny thing.\nWho told you to pull it? Jablonski downstairs? Or one of the boys on\nthe beat? I know those beat patrolmen, always on the lookout for a new\njoke.. But this tops 'em all. This is the--\"\n\n\"You're a disgrace to the Irish,\" Malone said tartly.\n\n\"A what?\" Lynch said. \"I'm not Irish.\"\n\n\"You talk like an Irishman,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I know it,\" Lynch said, and shrugged. \"Around some precincts, you\nsort of pick it up. When all the other cops are--hey, listen. How'd we\nget to talking about me?\"\n\n\"I said you were a disgrace to the Irish,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I was a--_what_?\"\n\n\"Disgrace.\" Malone looked carefully at Lynch. In a fight, he\nconsidered, he might get in a lucky punch that would kill Malone.\nOtherwise, Malone didn't have a thing to worry about except a few\nmonths of hospitalization.\n\nLynch looked as if he were about to get mad, and then he looked down\nat Malone's wallet again and started to laugh.\n\n\"For God's sake,\" Malone said. \"What's so damned funny?\"\n\nHe grabbed the wallet and turned it toward him. At once, of course, he\nrealized what had happened. He hadn't flipped it open to his badge at\nall. He'd flipped it open, instead, to a card in the card case:\n\n\n                 KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS THAT\n      Sir Kenneth Malone, Knight, is hereby formally installed\n                         with the title of\n                        KNIGHT OF THE BATH\n        and this card shall signify his right to that title\n     and his high and respected position as officer in and of\n                       THE QUEEN'S OWN FBI\n\n\nIn a very small voice, Malone said, \"There's been a terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"Mistake?\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone flipped the wallet open to his FBI shield. Lynch gave it a good\nlong examination, peering at it from every angle and holding it up to\nthe light two or three times. He even wet his thumb and rubbed the\nbadge with it. At last he looked up.\n\n\"I guess you are the FBI,\" he said. \"But what's with the gag?\"\n\n\"It isn't a gag,\" Malone said. \"It's just--\" He thought of the little\nold lady in Yucca Flats, the little old lady who had been the prime\nmover in the last case he and Boyd had worked on together. Without the\nlittle old lady, the case might never have been solved; she was an\nauthentic telepath, about the best that had ever been found.\n\nBut with her, Boyd and Malone had had enough troubles. Besides being a\ntelepath, she was quite thoroughly insane. She had one fixed delusion:\nshe believed she was Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nShe was still at Yucca Flats, along with the other telepaths Malone's\ninvestigation had turned up. And she still believed, quite calmly,\nthat she was Good Queen Bess. Malone had been knighted by her during\nthe course of the investigation. This new honor had come to him\nthrough the mail; apparently she had decided to ennoble some of her\nfriends still further.\n\nMalone made a mental note to ask Boyd if he'd received one. After all,\nthere couldn't be too many Knights of the Bath. There was no sense in\nletting _everybody_ in.\n\nThen he realized that he was beginning to believe everything again.\nThere had been times, working with the little old lady, when he had\nbeen firmly convinced that he was, in fact, the swaggering, ruthless\nswordsman, Sir Kenneth Malone. And even now...\n\n\"Well?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"It's too long a story,\" Malone said. \"And besides, it's not what I\ncame here about.\"\n\nLynch shrugged again. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Tell it your way.\"\n\n\"First,\" Malone said, \"what's your job?\"\n\n\"Me? Precinct Lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Of this precinct?\"\n\nLynch stared. \"What else?\" he said.\n\n\"Who knows?\" Malone said. He found the black notebook and passed it\nacross to Lynch. \"I'm on this red Cadillac business, you know,\" he\nsaid by way of introduction.\n\n\"I've been hearing about it,\" Lynch said. He picked up the notebook\nwithout opening it and held it like a ticking bomb. \"And I mean\nhearing about it,\" he said. \"We haven't had any trouble at all in this\nprecinct.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"I've read the reports.\"\n\n\"Listen, not a single red Cadillac has been stolen from here, or been\nreported found here. We run a tight precinct here, and let me tell\nyou--\"\n\n\"I'm sure you do a fine job,\" Malone said hastily. \"But I want you to\nlook at the notebook. The first page.\"\n\nLynch opened his mouth, closed it, and then flipped the notebook\ncover. He stared at the first page for a few seconds. \"What's this?\"\nhe said at last. \"Another gag?\"\n\n\"No gag, Lieutenant,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It's your name and mine,\" Lynch said. \"What is that supposed to\nmean?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Search me,\" he said. \"The notebook was found only a\ncouple of feet away from another car theft, last night.\" That was the\nsimplest way he could think of to put it. \"So I asked the Commissioner\nwho Peter Lynch was, and he told me it was you.\"\n\n\"And, by God, it is,\" Lynch said, staring at the notebook. He seemed\nto be expecting it to rise and strike him.\n\nMalone said, \"Have you got any idea who'd be writing about you and\nme?\"\n\nLynch shook his head. \"If I had any ideas I'd feel a lot better,\" he\nsaid.\n\nHe wet his finger and turned the notebook page carefully over. When he\nsaw the list of names on the second page he stopped again, and stared.\nThis time he whistled under his breath.\n\nVery cautiously, Malone said, \"Something?\"\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" Lynch said feelingly.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Malone said.\n\nThe police lieutenant looked up. \"I don't know if it's wrong or what,\"\nhe said. \"It gives me sort of the willies. I know every one of these\nkids.\"\n\nMalone took out a pill and swallowed it in a hurry. He felt exactly as\nif he had been given another concussion, absolutely free and without\nany obligations. His mouth opened but nothing came out for a long\ntime. At last he managed to say, _\"Kids?\"_\n\n\"That's right,\" Lynch said. \"What did you think?\"\n\nMalone shrugged helplessly.\n\n\"Every single one of them,\" Lynch said. \"Right from around here.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"Who are they?\" Malone said carefully.\n\n\"They're some kind of kid gang--a social club, or something like that.\nThis first kid--Miguel Fueyo's his full name--is the leader. They call\nthemselves the Silent Spooks.\"\n\n\"The what?\" It seemed to Malone that the name was just a little fancy,\neven for a kid gang.\n\n\"The Silent Spooks,\" Lynch said. \"I can't help it. But here they are,\nevery one of them: Fueyo, Ramon Otravez, Mario Grito, Silvo Envoz,\nAlvarez Altapor, Felipe la Barba, Juan de los Santos, and Ray del\nEste. Right down the line.\" He looked up from the notebook with a\nblank expression on his face. \"All of them kids from this\nneighborhood. The Silent Spooks.\"\n\n\"They know you?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure they do,\" Lynch said. \"They all know me. But do they know you?\"\n\nMalone thought. \"They could have heard of me,\" he said at last, trying\nto be as modest as possible.\n\n\"I guess,\" Lynch said grudgingly. \"How old are they?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Fourteen to seventeen,\" Lynch said. \"Somewhere in there. You know how\nthese kid things run.\"\n\n\"The Silent Spooks,\" Malone said meditatively. It was a nice name, in\na way; you just had to get used to it for a while. When he had been a\nkid, he'd belonged to a group that called itself the East Division\nStreet Kids. There just wasn't much romance in a name like that. Now\nthe Silent Spooks...\n\nWith a wrench, he brought his mind back to the subject at hand. \"Do\nthey get into much trouble?\" he said.\n\n\"Well, no,\" Lynch said reluctantly. \"As a matter of fact, they don't.\nFor a bunch like that, around here, they're pretty well behaved, as\nfar as that goes.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Malone said.\n\nLynch's face took on a delicately unconcerned appearance. \"I don't\nknow,\" he said. \"They just don't get into neighborhood trouble. Maybe\na scrap now and then--nothing big, though. Or maybe one of them cuts a\nclass at school or argues with his teacher. But there's nothing\nunusual, and damn little of anything.\" He frowned.\n\nMalone said, \"Something's got to be wrong. What is it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Lynch said, \"they do seem to have a hell of a lot of money to\nspend.\"\n\nMalone sat down in a chair across the desk, and leaned eagerly toward\nLynch. \"Money?\" he said.\n\n\"Money,\" Lynch said. \"New clothes. Cigarettes. Malone, three of them\nare even supporting their parents. Old Jose Otravez--Ramon's old\nman--quit his job a couple of months ago, and hasn't worked since.\nSpends all his time in bars, and never runs out of dough--and don't\ntell me you can do that on unemployment insurance. Or social security\npayments.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"I won't tell you.\"\n\n\"And there's others. All the others, in fact. Mike Fueyo's sister\ndresses fit to kill, like a high-fashion model. And the Grito kid--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"From what you tell me, this isn't just\na little extra money. These kids must be rolling in the stuff. Up to\ntheir ears in dough.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Lynch said sadly, \"Those kids spend more than I do. Hell,\nthey do better than that--they spend more than I _earn_.\" He looked\nremotely sorry for himself, but not for long. \"Every one of those kids\nspends like a drunken sailor, tossing his money away on all sorts of\nthings.\"\n\n\"Like an expense account,\" Malone said idly. Lynch looked up. \"Sorry,\"\nMalone said. \"I was thinking about something else.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you were,\" Lynch said with unconcealed envy.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"Really. Listen, I'll check with Internal Revenue\non that money. But have you got a list of the kids' addresses?\"\n\n\"I can get one,\" Lynch said, and went to the door.\n\nIt closed behind him. Malone sat waiting alone for a few minutes, and\nthen Lynch came back. \"List'll be here in a minute,\" he said. He sat\ndown behind his desk and reached for the notebook again. When he\nturned to the third page his expression changed to one of surprise.\n\n\"Be damned,\" he said. \"There does seem to be a connection, doesn't\nthere?\" He held up the picture of the red Cadillac for Malone to see.\n\n\"Sure does,\" Malone said. \"That's why I want those addresses. If there\nis a connection, I sure as hell want to find out about it.\"\n\nTen minutes later, Malone was walking out of the precinct station with\nthe list of addresses in his pocket. He was heading for his Great\nAdventure, but he didn't know it. All he was thinking about was the\nred Cadillacs, and the eight teenagers.\n\n\"I'm going to get to the bottom of this if it takes me all summer,\" he\nsaid, muttering to himself.\n\n\"That's the spirit,\" he told himself. \"Never say die.\"\n\nThen, realizing he had just said it, he frowned. Perhaps it hadn't\nreally counted. But then again...\n\nHe was on his way down the steps when he hit the girl.\n\nThe mutual collision was not catastrophic. On the other hand, it was\nnot exactly minor. It fell somewhere between the two, as an\nunclassifiable phenomenon of undoubted potency. Malone said, \"Oog,\"\nwith, some fervor as the girl collided with his chest and rebounded\nlike a handball striking a wall. Something was happening to her, but\nMalone had no time to spare to notice just what. He was falling\nthrough space, touching a concrete step once in a while, but not long\nenough to make any real acquaintance with it. It seemed to take him a\nlong time to touch bottom, and when he had, he wondered if _touch_ was\nquite the word.\n\n_Bottom_ certainly was. He had fallen backward and landed directly on\nhis _glutei maximi_, obeying the law regarding equal and opposite\nreaction and several other laws involving falling bodies.\n\nHis first thought was that he was now neatly balanced. His tail had\nreceived the same treatment as his head. He wondered if a person could\nget concussion of the tail bones, and had reached no definite\nconclusion when, unexpectedly, his eyes focused again.\n\nHe was looking at a girl. That was all he saw at first. She had\napparently fallen just as he had, bounced once and sat down rather\nhard. She was now lying flat on her back, making a sound like \"rrr\"\nbetween her teeth.\n\nMalone discovered that he was sitting undignifiedly on the steps. He\nopened his mouth to say something objectionable, took another look at\nthe girl, and shut it with a snap. This was no ordinary girl.\n\nHe smiled at her. She shook her head and sat up, still going \"rrr.\"\nThen she stopped and said instead, \"What do you think--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Malone said in what he hoped was a charming, debonair,\nand apologetic voice. It was quite a lot to get into one voice, but he\ntried his very hardest. \"I just didn't see--\"\n\n\"You didn't?\" the girl said. She took a long, slow look at him, shook\nher head again, and then pulled her skirt down carefully. \"If you\ndidn't, you must be blind,\" she said.\n\nMalone noticed with hope that there was no anger in her voice. The\nlast thing in the world he wanted was to get this girl angry at him.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Malone said. \"I'm not blind. Not blind at all.\" He smiled at\nher and stood up. His tail throbbed a little, but it didn't seem to be\nanything really serious. \"I'm just polite,\" he said, and smiled again.\nHis face was beginning to get a little tired, but he retained his last\nsmile as he went over to her, extended a hand and pulled her to her\nfeet.\n\nShe was something special. Her hair was long and dark, and fell in\nsoft waves to her shoulders. The shoulders were something all by\nthemselves, but Malone postponed consideration of them for a minute to\ntake a look at her face.\n\nIt was heart-shaped and rather thin. She had large brown liquid eyes\nthat could look, Malone imagined, appealing, loving, worshiping--or,\nlike a minute ago, downright furious. Below these features she had a\nstraight lovely nose and a pair of lips which Malone immediately\nclassified as kissable.\n\nHer figure, including the shoulders, was on the slim side, but she was\nvery definitely all there. Malone couldn't think of any parts the\nCreator had left out, and if there were any he didn't want to hear\nabout them. In an instant, Malone knew that he had met the only great\nlove of his life.\n\nAgain.\n\nHis mind was whirling, and for a second he didn't know what to do. And\nthen he remembered the Queen's Own FBI. Phrases flowered forth in his\nmind as if it were a garden packed corner to corner with the most\nexquisite varieties of blooming idiots.\n\n\"My deepest apologies, my dear,\" Sir Kenneth Malone said gallantly,\neven managing a small display bow for the occasion. \"May I be of any\nassistance?\"\n\nThe girl smiled up at him as she came to her feet. The smile was\nradiant and beautiful and almost loving. Malone felt as if he couldn't\nstand it. Tingles of the most wonderful kind ran through him, reached\nhis toes and then back the other way, meeting a whole new set going\nforward.\n\n\"You're very nice,\" the girl said, and the tingles became positive\nwaves of sensation. \"Actually, it was all my fault. Please don't\napologize, Mr.--\" She paused expectantly.\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said, his gallantry deserting him for the second. But it\nreturned full force before he expected it. \"I'm Malone,\" he said.\n\"Kenneth Joseph Malone.\" He had always liked the middle name he had\ninherited from his father, but he never had much opportunity to use\nit. He made the most of it now, rolling it out with all sorts of\nsubsidiary flourishes. As a matter of fact, he barely restrained\nhimself from putting a \"Sir\" before his name.\n\nThe girl's brown eyes widened just a trifle. Malone felt as if he\ncould have fallen into them and drowned. \"Oh, my,\" she said. \"You must\nbe a detective.\" And then, like the merest afterthought, \"My name's\nDorothy.\"\n\n_Dorothy._ It was a beautiful name. It made Malone feel all choked up\ninside. He blinked at the girl and tried to look manly and wonderful.\nIt was an effort, but he nearly carried it off.\n\nAfter a second or two he realized that she had asked him a question.\nHe didn't want to disillusion her in any way, and, after all, an FBI\nagent was a kind of detective, but he thought it was only fair that\nshe should know the whole truth about him right from the start.\n\n\"Not exactly a detective,\" he said.\n\n\"Not exactly?\" she said, looking puzzled. She looked positively\nglorious when puzzled, Malone decided at once.\n\n\"That is,\" he said carefully, \"I do detect, but not for the city of\nNew York.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"A private eye. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"no.\" She looked even more puzzled.\n\nMalone hastened to explain before he got to the point where\nconversation was impossible.\n\n\"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" he said. After a second he thought\nof a clarification and added, \"FBI.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the girl said. _\"Oh.\"_\n\n\"But you can call me Ken,\" Malone said.\n\n\"All right--Ken,\" she said. \"And you call me Dorothy.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. He tried it out. \"Dorothy.\" It felt swell.\n\n\"Well,\" she said after a second.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Were you looking for a detective? Because if I can\nhelp in any way--\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Dorothy said. \"Just a little routine business. I'll go\non in and--\"\n\nMalone suddenly found himself talking without having any idea why he'd\nstarted, or what he was going to say. At first he said, \"Urr,\" as if\nthe machine were warming up, and this stopped Dorothy and caused her\nto give him a rather sharp, baffled stare. Then he found some words\nand used them hurriedly, before they got away.\n\n\"Dorothy,\" he said, \"would you like to take in a show this evening? I\nthink I can get tickets to--well, I guess I could get tickets to\nalmost anything, if I really tried.\" His expression attempted to leave\nno doubt that he would really try.\n\nDorothy appeared to consider for a moment. \"Well,\" she said at last,\n\"how about _The Hot Seat_?\"\n\nMalone felt just the way he had several years before when he had\nbluffed his way into a gigantic pot during a Washington poker game,\nwith only a pair of fours to work with. At the last moment, his bluff\nhad been called.\n\nIt had, he realized, been called again. _The Hot Seat_ had set some\nsort of record, not only for Broadway longevity, but for audience\nfrenzy. Getting tickets for it was about the same kind of proposition\nas buying grass on the moon, and getting them with absolutely no prior\nnotice would require all the wire-pulling Malone could manage. He\nthought about _The Hot Seat_ and wished Dorothy had picked something\neasy, like arranging for her to meet the Senate.\n\nBut he swallowed bravely. \"I'll do my best,\" he said. \"Got any second\nchoice?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she said, and laughed. \"Pick any one you want. I haven't seen\nthem all, and the ones I have seen are worth seeing again.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I really didn't expect you to get tickets for _The Hot Seat_,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said, \"is impossible.\" He grinned at her.\n\"Meanwhile, where can I pick you up? Your home?\"\n\nDorothy frowned and shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"You see, I'm\nliving with an aunt, and I--well, never mind.\" She thought for a\nminute. \"I know,\" she said. \"Topp's.\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Topp's,\" Dorothy said. \"On Forty-second Street, just east of\nBroadway? It's a restaurant.\"\n\n\"I don't exactly know where it is,\" Malone said, \"but if it's there,\nI'll find it.\" He looked gallant and determined. \"We can get something\nto eat there before the show--whatever the show turns out to be.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Dorothy said.\n\n\"How about making it at six?\" Malone said.\n\nShe nodded. \"Six it is,\" she said. \"Now bye-bye.\" She touched her\nforefinger to her lips, and brushed Malone's cheek with the kissed\nfinger.\n\nBy the time the new set of tingles had begun to evaporate, she had\ngone into the police station. Malone heaved a great sigh of passion,\nand held down a strong impulse to follow her and protect her. He\nwasn't quite sure what he was going to protect her from, but he felt\ncertain that that would come to him when the time arrived.\n\nNevertheless, he had work to do, unpleasant as the idea had suddenly\nbegun to seem. He pulled the list of addresses out of his pocket and\nlooked at the first one.\n\n_Mike Fueyo._\n\nMike was the leader of the Silent Spooks, according to Lieutenant\nLynch. Logically, therefore, he would be the first one to talk to.\nMalone tried to think of some good questions, but the best one he\ncould come up with was: \"Well, what about all those red Cadillacs?\"\n\nSomehow he doubted that this would provide a satisfactory reply.\n\nHe checked the address again and started firmly down the street,\ntrying to think of some better questions along the way.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nThe building was just off Amsterdam Avenue, in the eighties. It had\nbeen a shining new development once, but it was beginning to slide\ndownhill now. The metal on the window frames was beginning to look\nworn, and the brickwork hadn't been cleaned in a long time. Where\nchain fences had once protected lonely blades of grass, children,\nmothers, and baby carriages held sway now, and the grass was gone.\nInstead, the building was pretty well surrounded by a moat of\nsick-looking brown dirt.\n\nMalone went into the first building and checked the name against the\nmailboxes there, trying to ignore the combined smells of sour milk,\nred pepper, and here and there a whiff of unwashed humanity.\n\nIt was on the tenth floor: _Fueyo, J._ That, he supposed, would be\nMike's widowed mother; Lynch had told him that much about the boy and\nhis family. He found the elevator, which was covered with scribbles\nranging from JANEY LOVES MIGUEL to startling obscenities, and rode it\nupstairs.\n\nApartment 1004 looked like every other apartment in the building, at\nleast from the outside. Malone pressed the button and waited a second\nto hear the faint buzzing at the other side of the door. After a\nminute, he pressed it again.\n\nThe door swung open very suddenly, and Malone stepped back.\n\nA short, wrinkled, dark-eyed woman in a print housedress was eying him\nwith deep suspicion. \"My daughter is not home,\" she announced at once.\n\n\"I'm not looking for your daughter,\" Malone said. \"I'd like to talk to\nMike.\"\n\n\"Mike?\" Her expression grew even more suspicious. \"You want to talk to\nMike?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah,\" the woman said. \"You one of those hoodlum friends he has. I'm\nright? You can talk to Mike when I am dead and have no control over\nhim. For now, you can just--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. He pulled out his wallet and flipped it\nopen to show his badge, being very careful that he made the right flip\nthis time. He didn't know exactly how this woman would react to the\nQueen's Own FBI, but he didn't especially want to find out.\n\nShe looked down at the badge without taking the wallet from him.\n\"Hah,\" she said. \"You're cop, eh?\" Her eyes left the wallet and\nexamined Malone from head to foot. It was perfectly plain that they\ndidn't like what they saw. \"Cop,\" she said again, as if to herself. It\nsounded like a curse.\n\nMalone said, \"Well, I--\"\n\n\"You want to ask me stupid questions,\" she said. \"That is what you\nwant to do. I'm right?\"\n\n\"I only--\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" she said. \"Nothing of any kind.\" She closed her\nmouth and stood regarding him as if he were a particularly repulsive\nstatue. Malone looked past her into the living room beyond the door.\n\nIt was faded now, but it had once been bright and colorful. There was\nan old rug on the floor, and tables were everywhere. The one bright\nthing about the room was the assortment of flowers; there were flowers\neverywhere, in vases, in pots, and even in window boxes. There was\nalso a lot of crockery statuary, mostly faded, chipped, or worn in\nsome way. The room looked to Malone as if its last inhabitant had died\nten years before; only the flowers had been renewed. Everything else\nhad not only the appearance of age, but the look of having been cast\nup as a high-water mark by the sea, which had receded and left only\nthe tangled wreckage.\n\nThe woman cleared her throat, and Malone's gaze came back to her. \"I\ncan tell you nothing,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want to talk to you,\" Malone said again. \"I want to talk to\nMike.\"\n\nHer eyes were very cold. \"You from the police, and you want to talk to\nMike. You make a joke. Only I don't think the joke is very funny.\"\n\n\"Joke?\" Malone said. \"You mean Mike's not here?\"\n\nHer gaze never wavered. \"You know he is not,\" she said. \"Ten minutes\nago the policemen were taking him away to the police station. How then\ncould he be here?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes ago?\" Malone blinked. Ten minutes ago he had been looking\nfor this apartment. Probably it hadn't taken Lynch's men ten minutes\nto find it; they weren't strangers in New York. \"He was arrested?\"\nMalone said.\n\n\"I said so, didn't I?\" the woman said. \"You must be crazy or else\nsomething.\" Her eyes were still cold points, but Malone suddenly saw a\nglow behind them, the glow of tears. Mike was her son. She did not\nseem surprised that the police had taken him away, but she was\ndetermined to protect him. He was her son.\n\nMalone's voice was very gentle. \"Why did they arrest him?\" he said.\n\nThe woman shrugged, a single sharp gesture. \"You ask me this?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I'm not a cop,\" Malone said. \"I'm from the FBI. I don't know anything\nabout why the cops might have arrested Mike.\"\n\n\"FBI?\" the woman said.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Malone said, with all the assurance he could muster.\n\"I only want to talk to him.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" the woman said. Tears were plain in her eyes now, glittering on\nthe surface. \"Why they take him away, I do not know. My Mike do\nnothing. Nothing.\"\n\n\"But didn't they say anything about--\"\n\n\"They say?\" the woman cried. \"They say only they have orders from this\nLieutenant Lynch. He is lieutenant at police station.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said gently.\n\n\"Lieutenant Lynch wants to ask Mike questions, so police come, take\nhim away.\" Her English was beginning to lose ground as the tears came\ncloser, as she slowly lost control.\n\n\"Lynch asked for him?\" Malone said. He frowned. Whatever that meant,\nhe wanted to be there himself. And perhaps he could help the old woman\nin some way. Anyhow, he would try. She stared up at him stonily.\n\"Look, Mrs. Fueyo,\" he said. \"I'm going down there to talk to Mike\nright now. And if he hasn't done anything, I'll see that he gets right\non home to you. Right away.\"\n\nHer expression changed a trifle. She did not actually soften, but\nMalone could feel the gratitude lurking behind her eyes as if it were\nafraid to come out. She nodded gravely and said nothing at all. He\nstepped away, and she closed the door without a sound.\n\nHe stood staring at the door for a few seconds. Then he turned and\npunched the elevator button savagely.\n\nThere wasn't any time to lose.\n\nHe walked back to the precinct station. Knowing the way, it took him\nabout five minutes instead of the fifteen it had taken him to find the\nFueyo residence. But he still felt as if time were passing much too\nfast. He ran up the steps and passed right by the desk sergeant, who\napparently recognized him; he said nothing as Malone charged up the\nstairs and around the hall to Lynch's office.\n\nIt was empty.\n\nMalone stared at it and started down the hall again without knowing\nwhere he was heading. Halfway to the stairs he met a patrolman.\n\n\"Where's Lynch?\" he asked.\n\n\"The lieutenant?\" the patrolman said.\n\nMalone fumed. \"Who else?\" he said. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Got some kid back in the tank, or somewhere,\" the patrolman said.\n\"Asking him a couple of questions, that's all.\" He added, \"Hey,\nlisten, buddy, what do you want to see the lieutenant for? I mean, you\ncan't just go charging in to--\"\n\nMalone was down the stairs before he'd finished. He went, up to the\ndesk.\n\nThe desk sergeant looked down. \"What's it this time?\" he said. \"A\ntrack meet?\"\n\n\"I'm in a hurry,\" Malone said. \"Where are the cells? I want to see\nLieutenant Lynch.\"\n\nThe desk sergeant nodded. \"Okay,\" he said. \"But the lieutenant ain't\nin any of the cells. He's back in Interrogation with some kid.\"\n\n\"Take me there,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll show you, anyway,\" the sergeant said. \"Can't leave the desk on\nduty.\" He cleared his throat and gave Malone a set of directions that\ntook him around to the back of the station. He was repeating the\ndirections when Malone left.\n\nThere was a door at the end of a corridor at the back of the station.\nIt was a plain wooden door with the numeral _1_ stenciled on it.\nMalone opened it and looked inside.\n\nHe was staring into a rather small, rather plain little room. There\nwere absolutely no bright beam lights burning, and there didn't seem\nto be any rubber hoses around anywhere. There were only four chairs.\n\nSeated in three of the chairs were Lieutenant Lynch and two other\npolice officers. In the fourth chair, facing them, was a young boy.\n\nHe didn't look like a tough kid. He had wavy black hair, brown eyes,\nand what Malone thought looked like a generally friendly appearance.\nHe was slight and wiry, not over five feet five or six. And he wore an\nexpression that was neither too eager nor hostile. It wasn't just\nblank, either; Malone finally pinned it down as receptive.\n\nHe had the strangest impression that he had seen the boy somewhere\nbefore. But he couldn't remember when or where.\n\nLieutenant Lynch was talking.\n\n\"...all we want, Mike, is a little information. We thought you'd be\nable to help us, if you wanted to. Now, how about it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Mike Fueyo said. His voice was a little high, but it was well\ncontrolled and responsive. \"Sure, Lieutenant. I'll help if I can, but\nI just don't dig what you're giving me. It doesn't make sense.\"\n\nLynch stirred a little impatiently, and his voice began to carry a new\nbite. \"I'm talking about Cadillacs,\" he said. \"Red Cadillacs, 1972\nmodels.\"\n\n\"It's a nice car,\" Mike said.\n\n\"What do you know about them?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Know about them?\" Mike said. \"I know they're nice cars. That's about\nit. What else am I going to know, Lieutenant? Maybe you think I own\none of these big red 1972 Caddies. Maybe you think I got that kind of\nmoney. Well, listen, Lieutenant. I'd like to help you out, but I'm\njust not--\"\n\n\"The Cadillacs,\" Lynch said, \"were--\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Lieutenant,\" Malone said. Dead silence fell with great\nsuddenness. Lynch and all the others looked around at Malone, who\nsmiled apologetically. \"I don't want to disturb anything,\" he said.\n\"But I would like to talk to Mike here for a little while.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Lynch said sourly. \"Sure. Sure.\"\n\n\"I'd like to ask him a couple of questions,\" Malone said. \"Alone.\"\n\n\"Alone.\" Lynch said. \"Oh.\" But there was nothing for him to do, Malone\nknew, except bow to the inevitable. \"Of course,\" he said. \"Go right\nahead.\"\n\n\"You can stand outside the door,\" Malone said. \"He won't get away. And\nyou'd better hold this.\" Malone, knowing perfectly well that staying\narmed and alone in a room with a suspect was something you just did\nnot do, unstrapped his .44 Magnum and handed it to the lieutenant.\n\nHe left reluctantly with his men. The door closed.\n\nMalone could understand Lynch's attitude. If Malone solved the case,\nLynch would not get any credit. Otherwise, it might go down in his\npersonal record. And of course the NYPD would rather wrap the case up\nthemselves; the FBI was treated as a necessary interference.\nUnfortunately, Malone thought, Lynch had had absolutely no choice. He\nsighed gently, and turned his attention to Mike Fueyo, who was still\nsitting in his chair.\n\n\"Now, Mike--\" he began, and was interrupted.\n\nThe door opened. Lieutenant Lynch said, \"If you need us, Malone, just\nyell.\"\n\n\"You'll hear me,\" Malone promised. The door shut.\n\nHe turned back to the boy. \"Now, Mike,\" he began again. \"My name is\nMalone, and I'm with the FBI in Washington. I'd like to ask you a\nfew--\"\n\n\"Gee, Mr. Malone,\" Mike broke in eagerly. \"I'm glad you're here. I'm\nreally glad about that.\"\n\nMalone said, \"Well, I--\"\n\n\"These cops here have been giving me a pretty rough deal, you know?\"\nMike said.\n\n\"I'm sure they--\" Malone began.\n\n\"But I've been looking for you,\" Mike went on. \"See, I wanted to say\nsomething to you. Something real important.\"\n\nMalone leaned forward expectantly. At last he was going to get some\ninformation--perhaps the information that would break the whole case\nwide open. He said, \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mike began, and stopped.\n\n\"You don't have to be afraid of me, Mike,\" Malone said. \"Just tell me\nwhatever's on your mind.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Mike said. \"It's this.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. Malone clenched his fists. Now it was coming.\nNow he would hear the all-important fact. He waited.\n\nMike stuck out his tongue and blew the longest, loudest, brassiest,\nand juiciest Bronx cheer that Malone had ever heard.\n\nThen, almost instantly, the room was empty except for Malone himself.\n\nMike was gone.\n\nThere wasn't any place to hide, and there hadn't been any time to hide\nin. Malone looked around wildly, but he had no doubts at all.\n\nMike Fueyo had vanished, utterly and instantaneously. He'd gone out\nlike a light.\n\n\n                                  5\n\nThirty seconds passed.\n\nDuring that time, Malone did nothing at all. He just sat there, while\na confused montage of pictures tumbled through his head. Sometimes he\nsaw double exposures, and sometimes a couple of pictures overlapped,\nbut it didn't seem to make any difference, because none of the\npictures meant anything anyhow.\n\nThe reason for that was obvious. He was no longer sane. He had cracked\nup. At a crucial moment his brain had failed him, and now people would\nhave to come in and cart him away and put him in a strait jacket. It\nwas perfectly obvious to Malone that he was no longer capable of\ndealing with everyday life. The blow on the head had probably taken\nfinal effect, and it had been more serious than the doctor had\nimagined.\n\nHe had always distrusted doctors anyhow.\n\nAnd now he was suffering from a delayed reaction. He wasn't living in\nthe real world any more. He had gone off to dreamland, where people\ndisappeared when you looked at them. There was no hope for him any\nmore.\n\nIt was a nice theory, and it was even comforting in a way. There was\nonly one thing wrong with it.\n\nThe room around him didn't look dreamlike at all. It was perfectly\nsolid and real, and it looked just the way it had looked before Mike\nFueyo had--well, Malone amended, before whatever had happened had\nhappened. It was a perfectly complete little room, and it had four\nchairs in it. Malone was sitting in one of the chairs and all the\nothers were empty.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing else in the room.\n\nWith some regret, Malone abandoned the theory that he had gone mad.\nThis left him with no ideas at all. Because if he hadn't become\ninsane, then what _had_ happened?\n\nAfter another second or two, some ideas began to filter through the\ndaze. Perhaps he'd just blacked out for a minute and the kid had gone\nout the door. That was possible, wasn't it?\n\nSure it was. And maybe he had just not seen the kid go. His eyes had\nfailed for a second or two. That could certainly happen after a blow\non the head. Malone tried to remember where the sight centers of the\nbrain were. Maybe whoever had hit him had disturbed them, and he'd had\na sudden blackout.\n\nCome to think of it, that made pretty good sense. He had blacked out,\nand Mike had just walked out the door. It had to be the door, of\ncourse--the windows were out of the question, since there weren't any\nwindows. And six-inch-wide air-conditioner ducts do not provide\nreasonable space for an exit, not if you happen to be a human being.\n\nThat, Malone told himself, was settled--and a good thing, too. He had\nbegun to worry about it. But now he knew just what had happened, and\nhe felt relieved. He got up from his chair, walked over to the door\nand opened it.\n\nLieutenant Lynch nearly fell into the room. He'd obviously had his ear\npressed tightly to the door and hadn't expected it to open. The other\ntwo cops stood behind him, just about filling the hallway with their\nbroad shoulders.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said.\n\nLynch recovered his balance and glared at the FBI agent. He said\nnothing.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Lynch repeated, and blinked. \"Where's _who_?\"\n\nMalone shook his head impatiently. \"Fueyo,\" he said. \"The kid. Where\ndid he--\"\n\nLynch's expression was the same as that on the faces of the other two\ncops: complete and utter bafflement. Malone stopped and stared. It was\nsuddenly very obvious that the lovely theory he had worked out for\nMike's disappearance wasn't true in the least. If Mike Fueyo had come\nout the door, then these cops would know about it. But they obviously\nknew nothing at all about it.\n\nTherefore, he hadn't come out through the door.\n\nMalone took a deep breath.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Lynch said. \"Isn't the kid in there with\nyou? What's happened?\"\n\nThere was only one thing to do and, straight-faced, Malone went ahead\nand did it. \"Of course not,\" he snapped, trying to sound impatient and\nofficial. \"I released him.\"\n\n\"You _what_?\"\n\n\"Released him,\" Malone said. He stepped out into the hall and closed\nthe door of the interrogation room firmly behind him. \"I got all the\ninformation I needed, so I let him go.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Lynch said bitterly. \"After all, I was the one who--\"\n\n\"You called him in for questioning, didn't you, Lieutenant?\" Malone\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes, I did, and I--\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I questioned him.\"\n\nThere was a little silence. Then Lynch asked, in a strangled voice,\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone said at once. \"That's classified information.\" He\npushed his way into the corridor, trying to look as if he had fifteen\nother jobs to accomplish within the next hour. Being an FBI agent was\ngoing to help a little, but he still had to look good in order to\ncarry it off.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Thanks for your co-operation, Lieutenant,\" Malone said. \"You've all\nbeen very helpful.\" He smiled at them in what he hoped was a superior\nmanner. \"So long,\" he said, and started walking.\n\n\"Wait!\" Lynch said. He flung open the door of the interrogation room.\nThere was no doubt that it was empty. \"Wait! Malone!\"\n\nMalone turned slowly, trying to look calm and in control of the\nsituation. \"Yes?\" he said.\n\nLynch looked at him with puzzled, pleading eyes. \"Malone, _how_ did\nyou release him? We were right here. He didn't come through the door.\nThere isn't any other exit. So how did you get him out?\"\n\nThere was only one answer to that, and Malone gave it with a quiet,\nassured air. \"I'm terribly sorry, Lieutenant,\" he said, \"but that's\nclassified information, too.\" He gave the cops a little wave and\nwalked slowly down the corridor. When he reached the stairs he began\nto speed up and he was out of the precinct station and into a taxicab\nbefore any of the cops could have realized what had happened.\n\nHe took a deep breath, feeling as if it were the first he'd had in\nseveral days. \"Breathe air,\" he told himself. \"It's _good_ for you.\"\nNot that New York had any real air in it. It was mostly carbon fumes\nand the like. But it was the nearest thing to air that Malone could\nfind at the moment, and he determined to go right on breathing it\nuntil something better and cleaner showed up.\n\nBut that wasn't important now. As the cab tooled along down Broadway\ntoward 69th Street, Malone closed his eyes and began going over the\nwhole thing in his mind.\n\nMike Fueyo had vanished.\n\nOf that, Malone told himself, there was no shadow of doubt. No\nprobable, possible shadow of doubt.\n\nNo possible doubt (as a matter of fact) whatever.\n\nDismissing the Grand Inquisitor with a negligent wave of his hand, he\nconcentrated on the main question. It was a good question. Malone\ncould have sat and pondered it admiringly for a long time.\n\nAs a matter of fact, that was all he could think of to do, as the cab\nturned up 70th Street and headed east. He certainly didn't have any\nanswers for it.\n\nBut it was a lovely question:\n\n_Where does that leave Kenneth J. Malone?_\n\nAnd, possibly even more important: _Where was Miguel Fueyo?_\n\nIt was obvious that he'd vanished on purpose. And it hadn't just been\nsomething he'd recently discovered. He had known all along that he\ncould pull the trick; if he hadn't known that, he wouldn't have done\nwhat he had done beforehand. No seventeen-year-old boy, no matter what\nhe was, would give the FBI the raspberry unless he was pretty sure he\ncould get away with it.\n\nMalone remembered the raspberry and winced slightly. The cab driver\ncalled back, \"Anything wrong, buddy?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" Malone said. \"But don't worry about it.\"\n\nThe cab driver shrugged and turned back to the wheel. Malone went back\nto Mike Fueyo.\n\nThe kid could make himself vanish at will.\n\nInvisibility?\n\nMalone thought about that for a while. The fact that it was impossible\ndidn't decide him against it. Everything was impossible; that much was\nclear. But he didn't think Mike Fueyo had just become invisible. No.\nThere had been the sense of presence actually leaving the room. If\nMike had become invisible and stayed, Malone was sure he wouldn't have\nfelt the boy leave.\n\nMike had not just become invisible. (_And what do I mean, \"just\"?_\nMalone asked himself unhappily.) He had gone--elsewhere.\n\nThis brought him back full circle to his original question. Where was\nthe boy now? But he ignored it for a minute or two as another, even\nmore difficult query presented itself.\n\n_Never mind where_, Malone told himself. _How?_\n\nSomething was bothering him. Malone realized that it had been\nbothering him for a long time. At last he managed to locate it and\nhold it up to the light for inspection.\n\nDr. O'Connor, the psionics expert at Westinghouse, had mentioned\nsomething during Malone's last conversation with him. Dr. O'Connor,\nwho'd invented a telepathy detector, had been discussing further\nreaches in his field.\n\n\"After all,\" he'd said, \"if thoughts can bridge any distance whatever,\nregardless of other barriers, there is no reason why matter could not\ndo likewise.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't,\" Malone had said. \"Or at least it hasn't so far.\"\n\n\"There's no way to be sure of that,\" Dr. O'Connor had said sternly.\n\"After all, we have no reports of it--but that means little. Our\nsearch has only begun.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone had said. \"Sure.\"\n\n\"Matter, controlled by thought, might bridge distances\ninstantaneously,\" Dr. O'Connor had said.\n\nAnd he'd referred to something, some word...\n\n_Teleportation._\n\nThat was it. Malone sat back. All you had to do, he reflected, was to\nthink yourself somewhere else, and--bing!--you were there. If Malone\nhad been able to do it, it would not only have saved him a lot of time\nand trouble, but also such things as cab fare and train fare and ...\noh, a lot of different things.\n\nBut he couldn't. And Dr. O'Connor hadn't found anyone else who could,\neither. As far as Malone knew, nobody could teleport.\n\nExcept Mike Fueyo.\n\nThe cab stopped in front of FBI headquarters. \"You some kind of secret\nagent?\" the cabbie said. \"Like on 3-D?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Malone said pleasantly. \"I'm a foreign spy.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the cabbie said. \"Sure.\" He took his money with a somewhat\npuzzled air, while Malone crossed the sidewalk and went into the\nbuilding.\n\nEveryone was active. Malone pushed his way through arguing knots of\nmen until he reached the small office which he and Boyd had been\nassigned. He had already decided not to tell Boyd about the\ndisappearing boy. That would only confuse him, and matters were\nconfused enough as they stood. Malone had no proof; he had only his\nword and the word of a few baffled policemen, all of whom were\nprobably thoroughly confused by now.\n\nBoyd had a job to do, and Malone had decided to let him go on doing\nit. That, as a matter of fact, was what he was doing when Malone\nentered the room.\n\nHe was sitting at his desk, talking on the telephone. Malone couldn't\nsee the face on the screen, but Boyd was scowling at it fiercely.\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"So some guy makes a fuss. That's what you're there\nfor.\"\n\n\"But he wants to sue the city,\" a voice said tinnily. \"Or somebody,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"Let him sue,\" Boyd said. \"We've got authority. Just get that car.\"\n\n\"Look,\" the voice said. \"I--\"\n\n\"I don't care now,\" Boyd snapped. \"Get it. Then hand it over to the\npickup squad and say, 'Mr. Malone wants this car immediately.' They'll\nknow what to do. Got that?\"\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Boyd,\" the voice said. \"But I don't--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Boyd said. \"Go ahead and get the job done. The United\nStates of America is depending on you.\" With one last scowl, he hung\nup and swung around to face Malone. \"You gave me a great job,\" he\nsaid. \"I really love it, you know that?\"\n\n\"It's got to be done,\" Malone said in a noncommittal voice. \"How's it\ngoing so far?\"\n\nBoyd closed his eyes for a second. \"Twenty-three red 1972 Cadillacs to\ndate--which isn't bad, I suppose,\" he said. \"And six calls like the\none you just heard. All from agents with problems. What _am_ I\nsupposed to do when a guy catches a couple necking in a 1972 red\nCadillac?\"\n\n\"At this time of day?\" Malone said.\n\n\"New York,\" Boyd said, and shrugged. \"Things are funny here.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"What did you do about them?\" he said.\n\n\"Told the agent to take the car and give 'em a pass to a movie,\" Boyd\nsaid.\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"Keep that sort of thing in the dark where it\nbelongs.\" For some reason, this reminded him of Dorothy. He still had\nto get tickets for a show. But that could wait. \"How about the\nassembly line?\" he said.\n\n\"Disassembly,\" Boyd said. \"Leibowitz has started it going. He borrowed\nthe use of a big auto repair shop out in Jersey City, and they'll be\ndoing a faster job than we thought.\" He paused. \"But it's been a\nwonderful day,\" he said. \"One to remember as long as I live. Possibly\neven until tomorrow. And how have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I'm not absolutely sure yet.\"\n\n\"That's a nice helpful answer,\" Boyd said. \"In the best traditions of\nthe FBI.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" Malone said. \"It's true.\"\n\n\"Well, what the hell have you been doing?\" Boyd said. \"Drinking?\nHelling around? Living it up while I sit here and talk to people about\nCadillacs?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Malone said. \"I've been--well, doing more or less what\nBurris told me to do. Nosing around. Keeping my eyes open. I think--\"\n\nThe phone chimed. Boyd flipped up the mike and eyed the screen\nbalefully. \"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" he said crisply. \"Who\nthe hell are you?\"\n\nA voice on the other end said, \"What?\" before the image on the screen\ncleared.\n\n\"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Boyd said in a perfectly innocent\nvoice. \"Boyd speaking.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" a voice said. It was a very calm, quiet voice. \"Hello, Boyd.\"\n\nThe image cleared. Boyd was facing the picture of a man in his middle\nthirties, a brown-haired man with large, gentle brown eyes and an\nexpression that somehow managed to look both sad and confident.\n\"Hello, Dr. Leibowitz,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Is Mr. Malone in?\" Leibowitz said. \"I really wanted to talk to him.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"Just a second.\"\n\nHe motioned to Malone, who came around and sat at Boyd's desk as Boyd\ngot up. He nodded to Leibowitz, and the electronics engineer nodded\nback.\n\n\"How's everything coming, Dr. Leibowitz?\" Malone said.\n\nLeibowitz shrugged meaningfully. \"All right,\" he said. \"I called you\nto tell you about that, by the way. We've managed to cut the per-car\ntime down somewhat.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It's now down to about four hours per car, and that means we may be\nable to do even better than running one off the line every fifteen\nminutes. At the moment, fifteen minutes is about standard, though,\nwith sixteen cars in the line.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But anything you can do to speed it up--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Leibowitz said. \"Of course I'll do anything that I can\nfor you. I have got a small preliminary report, by the way.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"The first car has just been run off the assembly line,\" Leibowitz\nsaid. \"And I'm afraid, Mr. Malone, that there's nothing odd about it\nat all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"we can't expect to hit the jackpot with our\nfirst try.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Leibowitz said. \"But the second should be off soon.\nAnd then the rest. I'm keeping my eye on every one, of course.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said, and meant it. Leibowitz was the kind of man who\ninspired instant and complete trust. Malone was perfectly sure he'd do\nthe job he had started to do. Then an idea struck him. \"Has the first\ncar been reassembled yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Leibowitz said. \"We took that step into account in our\ntiming. What would you like done with it--and with the other ones, as\nthey come off?\"\n\n\"Unless you can find something odd about a car, just return it to its\nowner,\" Malone said. \"Or pass the problem on to the squad men; they'll\ntake care of it.\" He paused. \"If you do find something odd--\"\n\n\"I'll call you at once, of course,\" Leibowitz said.\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"Incidentally, I did want to ask you something. I\ndon't want you to think I'm doubting your work, or anything like that.\nBelieve me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you're not,\" Leibowitz said.\n\n\"But,\" Malone said, \"why does it take so long? I'd think it would be\nfairly easy to spot a robotic or a semi-robotic brain capable of\ncontrolling a car.\"\n\n\"It might have been, once,\" Leibowitz said. \"But these days the\nproblems are rather special. Oh, I don't mean we can't do it--we can\nand we will. But with subminiaturization, Mr. Malone, and semipsionic\ncircuits, a pretty good brain can be hidden beneath a coat of paint.\"\n\nFor no reason at all, Malone suddenly thought of Dorothy again. \"A\ncoat of paint?\" he said in a disturbed tone.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Leibowitz said, and smiled at him. It was a warm smile\nthat had little or nothing to do with the problem they were talking\nabout. But Malone liked it. It made him feel as if Leibowitz liked\nhim, and approved of him. He grinned back.\n\n\"But a coat of paint isn't very much,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be very much,\" Leibowitz said. \"Not these days.\nI've often told Emily--that's my wife, Mr. Malone--that I could hide a\nTV circuit under her lipstick. Not that there would be any use in it;\nbut the techniques are there. Mr. Malone. And if your conjecture is\ncorrect, someone is using them.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure. But you _can_ find the circuits, if they're\nthere?\"\n\nLeibowitz nodded slowly. \"We can, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"They betray\nthemselves. A microcircuit need not be more than a few microns thick,\nyou see--as far as the conductors and insulators are concerned, at any\nrate. But the regulators-transistors and such--have to be as big as a\npinhead.\"\n\n\"Enormous, huh?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Leibowitz said, and chuckled, \"quite large enough to locate\nwithout trouble, at any rate. They're very hard to conceal. And the\nleads from the brain to the power controls are even easier to\nfind--comparatively speaking, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said.\n\n\"All the brain does, you see,\" Leibowitz said, \"is control the\nmechanism that steers the car. But it takes real power to steer--a\ngreat deal more than it does to compute the steering.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone, who didn't, said desperately. \"In other words, unless\nsomething radically new has been developed, you can find the\ncircuits.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Leibowitz said, grinning. \"It would have to be something very\nnew indeed, Mr. Malone. We're up on most of the latest developments\nhere; we've got to be. But I don't want you giving me the credit for\nthis.\"\n\n\"No?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Leibowitz said. \"All I do is work out the general\napplication to theory, as far as actual detection is concerned. It's\nmy partner, Mr. Hardin, who takes care of all the engineering\ndetails.\"\n\nMalone said, \"Well, so long as one of you--\"\n\n\"Sal's a real crackerjack,\" Leibowitz said enthusiastically. \"He had\nan intuitive feel about these things. It's really amazing to watch him\ngo to work.\"\n\n\"It must be,\" Malone said politely.\n\n\"Oh, it really is,\" Leibowitz said. \"And it's because of Sal that I\ncan make the guarantee I do make: that if there are any unusual\ncircuits in those cars, we can find them.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"I'm sure you'll do the job. And we need that\ninformation. Don't bother to send along a detailed report, though,\nunless you find something out of the ordinary.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Malone,\" Leibowitz said. \"I wouldn't have bothered you\nexcept for the production speed-up here.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Malone said. \"It's perfectly all right. I'll be\nhearing from you, then?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Malone,\" Leibowitz said.\n\nMalone cut the circuit at once and started to turn away, but he never\ngot the chance. It started to chime again at once.\n\n\"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Malone said as he flipped up the\nreceiver. He wanted badly to copy Boyd's salutation, but he found that\nhe just didn't have the gall to do it, and said sadly instead, \"Malone\nspeaking.\"\n\nThere was no immediate answer from the other party. Instead, the\nscreen slowly cleared, showing Malone the picture of a woman he\nrecognized instantly.\n\nIt was Juanita Fueyo, Mike's mother.\n\nMalone stared at her. It seemed to him as if a couple of hours passed\nwhile he tried to find his voice. Of course, she'd looked up the FBI\nnumber in the phone book, and found him that way. But she was about\nthe last person on earth from whom he'd expected a call.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Malone,\" she said, \"thank you so much. You got my Mike back\nfrom the police.\"\n\nMalone gulped. \"I did?\" he said. \"Well, I--\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Malone, you must help me again. Because now my Mike says he\nmust not stay at home! He is leaving, he is leaving right away!\"\n\n\"Leaving?\" Malone said.\n\nHe thought of a thousand things to do. He could send a squad of men to\narrest Mike. And Mike could disappear while they were trying to get\nhold of him. He could go down himself--and be greeted, if he knew Mike\nFueyo, with another giant economy-size raspberry. He could try to\nplead with Mike on the phone.\n\nAnd what good would that do?\n\nSo, instead, he just sat and stared while Mrs. Fueyo went right on.\n\n\"He says he will send me money, but money is nothing compared to my\nown boy, my own Mike. He says he must go away, Mr. Malone, but I know\nyou can stop him. I know it!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But I--\"\n\n\"Oh, I knew that you would,\" Mrs. Fueyo shrieked. She almost came\nthrough the screen at him. \"You are a great man, Mr. Malone. I will\nsay many prayers for you. Every day I will pray for you in all your\nwork. I will never stop praying for you because you help me.\" Her\nvoice and face changed abruptly. \"Excuse me now,\" she said. \"I must go\nback to work.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"if I--\"\n\nThen she turned back and beamed at him again. \"Oh, thank you, Mr.\nMalone. Thank you with the thanks of a mother. Bring my boy back to\nme.\"\n\nAnd the image faded and died.\n\nBoyd tapped Malone on the shoulder. \"I didn't know you were involved\nin an advice column for the lovelorn,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not,\" Malone said sourly.\n\nBoyd sighed. \"I'll bite,\" he said. \"Who was that?\"\n\nMalone thought of several possible answers and finally chose one.\n\"That,\" he said, \"was my mother-in-law. She worries about me every\ntime I go out on a job with you.\"\n\n\"Very funny,\" Boyd said. \"I am screaming with laughter.\"\n\n\"Just get back to work, Tommy-boy,\" Malone said, \"and leave everything\nto me.\"\n\nHe hoped he sounded more confident than he felt. Lighting a\ncigarette--and wishing he were alone in his own room, so that he could\nsmoke a cigar and not have to worry about looking dashing and\nalert--Malone strolled out of the office with a final wave to Boyd. He\nwas thinking about Mike Fueyo, and he stopped his chain of reasoning\njust long enough to look in at the office of the Agent-in-Charge, and\nask him to pry loose two tickets for _The Hot Seat_ for that night.\n\n\"My God,\" the agent said. He was a tall thin man who looked as if he\nsuffered from chronic stomach trouble. \"You must be crazy. Are they\nall like that in Washington?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"Some of them are pretty normal. There's\nthis one man--Napoleon, we call him--who keeps insisting that he\nshould have won the battle of Waterloo. But otherwise he's perfectly\nfine.\"\n\nHe flicked his cigarette in the air and left, grinning. Five steps\naway the grin disappeared and a frown took its place.\n\n\n                                  6\n\nHe walked along 69th Street to Park Avenue without noticing where he\nwas going. Luckily, the streets weren't really crowded, and Malone\nonly had to apologize twice, once for stepping on a man's toe and once\nfor absently toeing a woman's dog. When he reached the corner he\nheaded downtown, humming _Kathleen Mavourneen_ under his breath and\ntrying to figure out his next move.\n\nHe needed more than one move. He needed a whole series of moves. This\nwas not the usual kind of case. Burris had called it a vacation and,\nin one way, Malone supposed, Burris was perfectly right. For once\nthere was no question about who had committed the crimes. It was\nobvious by now that Mike Fueyo and his Silent Spooks had been stealing\nthe Cadillacs.\n\nIt was even obvious that Mike--or someone with Mike's talent--had\nbopped him on the head, and taken the red Cadillac he had been\nexamining. And the same gang probably accounted for the Sergeant\nJukovsky affair, too.\n\nOr at least it was reasonable to assume that they did, Malone thought.\nHe could see how it had worked. One of the Silent Spooks was a lot\nsmaller than a grown man, and the two cops who hadn't seen anyone in\nthe parked car just hadn't been able to catch sight of the undersized\ndriver. Of course, there _had_ been someone in the car when it had\nbeen driving along the West Side Highway. Someone who had teleported\nhimself right out of the car when it had gone over the embankment.\n\nThat, of course, meant that there would be no secret machines found in\nthe red Cadillacs Leibowitz and Hardin were examining now. But Malone\nhad already decided to let that phase of things go on. First of all,\nit was always possible that he was wrong, and that some such machine\nreally did exist. Second, even if they didn't find a machine, they\nmight find something else. Almost anything, he thought, might turn up.\n\nAnd third, it kept Boyd decently busy, and out of Malone's hair.\n\nThat had been an easy solution. And, Malone thought, the problem of\nwho had been taking the red Cadillacs looked just as easy now, if his\nanswers were right. And he was reasonably sure of that.\n\nUnfortunately, he was now left with a new and unusual question: _How\ndo you catch a teleport?_\n\nMalone looked up, jarred to a stop by a man built like a brown bear,\nwith a chunky body and an oval, slightly sloping head and face. He had\nvery short brown hair shot through with gray, and gave Malone a small\ninquisitive stare and looked away without a word.\n\nMalone mumbled, \"Sorry,\" and looked up at the street sign. He was at\n47th Street and Park Avenue. He jerked a hand up to his face, and\nmanaged to hook the chunky man by the suit. It fell away, exposing the\ninitials S.M. carefully worked into his shirt. Second Mistake, Malone\nthought wildly, muttered, \"Sorry,\" again and turned west, feeling\nfairly grateful to the unfortunate bystander.\n\nHe had reminded Malone of one thing. If he wanted to get even a part\nof his plan past the drawing-board stage, he had to make a call in a\nhurry.\n\nHe found a phone booth in a bar called the Ad Lib, at Madison Avenue.\nSternly telling himself that he was stopping there to make a phone\ncall, a business phone call, and not to have a drink, he marched right\npast the friendly bartender and went into the phone booth, where he\nmade a call to New York Police Commissioner John Henry Fernack.\n\nFernack's face was that of an old man, but there was no telling how\nold. The early seventies was one guess, Malone imagined; the late\nfifties might be another. He looked tough, as if he had spent all of\nhis life trying to persuade other people that he was young enough for\nthe handball tournament. When he saw Malone, his eyebrows lifted\nslightly, but he didn't say anything.\n\n\"Commissioner,\" Malone said, \"I called to ask you to do me a favor.\"\n\nThere was caution hidden in the calm and quiet voice. \"Well,\" Fernack\nsaid, \"what is it, Malone?\"\n\n\"Can you have all the robberies for a given period run through the\ncomputer?\" Malone said. \"I need some dope.\"\n\n\"Depends on the given period,\" Fernack said. \"I can't do it for 1774.\"\n\n\"What would I need data on robberies in 1774 for?\" Malone said,\nhonestly interested.\n\n\"I never question the FBI,\" Fernack said soberly. \"But what dates do\nyou want?\"\n\n\"The past year, maybe the past year and a half.\"\n\n\"And what data?\"\n\n\"I want every reported crime that hasn't been solved,\" Malone said,\n\"and which seems to have been committed by some impossible means. A\nsafe that was robbed without being opened, for instance--that's the\nkind of thing I mean.\"\n\n\"Every unsolved crime?\" Fernack said. \"Now, hold your horses, Malone.\nI'm not at all sure that--\"\n\n\"Don't worry about a thing, Commissioner,\" Malone said. \"This is\nconfidential.\"\n\n\"You know how I'd feel about this if word ever got out to--\"\n\n\"I said confidential, John Henry,\" Malone said, trying to sound\nfriendly and trustworthy. \"After all, every place has unsolved crimes.\nEven the FBI isn't absolutely perfect.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Fernack said. \"Sure. But confidential, Malone.\"\n\n\"You have my word,\" Malone said sincerely.\n\nFernack said, \"Well--\"\n\n\"How fast can you get me the dope?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I don't exactly know,\" Fernack said. \"The last time anything even\nremotely like this was run through--departmental survey, but you\nwouldn't be interested--it took something like eight hours.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Eight hours, then. I'll look everything over and\nif we need a second run-through it won't take too long. I'll let you\nknow as soon as I can about that.\" He grinned into the phone.\n\nFernack cleared his throat and asked delicately, \"Mind telling me what\nall this is for?\"\n\nMalone offered up a little prayer before answering, and when he did\nanswer it was in his softest and friendliest tones. \"I'd rather not\nsay just now, John Henry.\"\n\n\"But, Malone--\" Fernack's voice sounded a little strained, and his jaw\nset just a trifle--\"if you--\"\n\nMalone knew perfectly well how Fernack reacted when he didn't get a\nbit of information he wanted. And this was no time to set off any\nfireworks in the commissioner's office. \"Look, John Henry,\" he said\ngently, \"I'll tell you as soon as I can. Honest. But this is\nclassified information; it's not my fault.\"\n\nFernack said, \"But--\" and apparently realized that argument was not\ngoing to do him any good. \"All right, Malone,\" he said at last. \"I'll\nhave it for you as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. \"Then I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Fernack said. He paused, as if he were about to open the\ncontroversy just once more. But all he said was \"So long, Malone.\"\n\nMalone breathed a great sigh of relief and flipped the phone off. He\nstepped out of the booth feeling so proud of himself that he could\nbarely walk. Not only had he managed to calm down Commissioner\nFernack, he had also walked right past a bar on the way to the phone.\nHe had performed several acts, he felt, above and beyond the call of\nduty, and he told himself that he deserved a reward.\n\nHappily, the reward was convenient to hand. He went to the bar and\nbeckoned the bartender over to him. \"Bourbon and soda,\" he said. \"And\na medal, if possible.\"\n\n\"A what?\" the bartender said.\n\n\"A medal,\" Malone said. \"For conduct beyond reproach.\"\n\nThe bartender nodded sadly. \"Maybe you just ought to go home, Mac,\" he\nsaid. \"Sleep it off for a while.\"\n\nNew Yorkers, Malone decided as the bartender went off to get his\ndrink, had no sense of humor. Back in Chicago--where he'd been more or\nless weaned on gin, and discovered that, unlike his father, he didn't\nmuch care for the stuff--and even in Washington, people didn't go\naround accusing you of drunkenness just because you made some harmless\nlittle pleasantry.\n\nOh, well. Malone drank his drink and went out into the afternoon\nsunlight.\n\nHe considered the itinerary of the magical Miguel Fueyo. He had gone\nstraight home from the police station, apparently, and had then told\nhis mother that he was going to leave home. But he had promised to\nsend her money.\n\nOf course, money was easy for Mike to get. With a shudder, Malone\nthought he was beginning to realize just _how_ easy. Houdini had once\nboasted that no bank vault could hold him. In Mike Fueyo's case, that\nwas just doubly true. The vault could neither hold him out nor keep\nhim in.\n\nBut he was going to leave home.\n\nMalone said, \"Hmm,\" to himself, cleared his throat and tried it again.\nBy now he was at the corner of the block, where he nearly collided\nwith a workman who was busily stowing away a gigantic ladder, a pot of\npaint, and a brush. Malone looked at the street sign, where the words\n_Avenue of the Americas_ had been painted out, and _Sixth Avenue_\nhand-lettered in.\n\n\"They finally give in,\" the painter told him. \"But do you think they\nbuy new signs? Nah. Cheap. That's all they are. Cheap as pretzels.\" He\ngave Malone a friendly push with one end of the ladder and disappeared\ninto the crowd.\n\nMalone didn't have the faintest idea of what he was talking about. And\nhow cheap could a pretzel be, anyhow? Malone didn't remember ever\nhaving seen an especially tight-fisted one.\n\nNew York, he decided for the fifteenth time, was a strange place.\n\nHe walked downtown for a block, still thinking about Mike Fueyo, and\nabsently turned west again. Between Sixth and Seventh, he had another\nattack of brilliance and began looking for another phone booth.\n\nHe found one in a Mexican bar named the Xochitl, across the street\nfrom the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin. It was a coincidence that he\nhad landed in another bar, he told himself hopefully, but he didn't\nquite believe it. To prove it to himself, he headed straight for the\nphone booths again and put in his call, ignoring the blandishments of\nseveral rows of sparkling bottles which he passed on the way.\n\nHe dialed the number of Lieutenant Lynch's precinct, and then found\nhimself connected with a new desk sergeant.\n\n\"I'm Malone,\" he said. \"I want to talk to Lynch.\"\n\n\"Glad to know you, Malone,\" the desk sergeant said pleasantly. \"Only\n_Lieutenant_ Lynch doesn't want to subscribe to the Irish _Echo_!\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" Malone said, \"I'm the FBI.\" He showed his badge.\n\nThe desk sergeant took a good long look at it. \"Maybe you are, and\nmaybe you aren't,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Does the lieutenant know you?\"\n\n\"We were kids together,\" Malone said. \"We're brothers. Siamese twins.\nPut him on the phone.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said the desk sergeant. \"I'll check.\"\n\nThe screen went blank for two agonizing minutes before it cleared\nagain to show Lynch's face.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Malone,\" Lynch said formally. \"Have you found some new\nlittle trick to show up poor stupid policemen? Like, say, making\nyourself vanish?\"\n\n\"I'll make the whole damn police force vanish,\" Malone said, \"in a\ncouple of minutes. I called to ask a favor.\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Lynch said. \"Anything within my poor power. Whatever I\nhave is yours. Whither thou goest--\"\n\n\"Knock it off,\" Malone said, and then grinned. After all, there was no\nsense in making an enemy out of Lynch.\n\nLynch blinked, took a deep breath, and said in an entirely different\nvoice, \"Okay, Malone. What's the favor?\"\n\n\"Do you still have that list of Silent Spooks?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure I do,\" Lynch said. \"Why? I gave you a copy of it.\"\n\n\"I can't do this job,\" Malone said. \"You'll have to.\".\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Lynch said, and saluted.\n\n\"Just listen,\" Malone said. \"I want you to check up on every kid on\nthat list.\"\n\n\"And what are we supposed to do when we find them?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"That's the trouble,\" Malone said. \"You won't.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"I'll lay you ten to one,\" Malone said, \"that every one of them has\nskipped out. Left home. Without giving a forwarding address.\"\n\nLynch nodded slowly. \"Ten to one?\" he said. \"Want to make that a money\nbet? Or does the FBI frown on gambling?\"\n\n\"Ten dollars to your one,\" Malone said. \"Okay?\"\n\n\"Made,\" Lynch said. \"You've got the bet--just for the hell of it,\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And where can I call you to collect?\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"You can't,\" he said. \"I'll call you.\"\n\n\"I will wait with anxiety,\" Lynch said. \"But it had better be before\neight. I get off then.\"\n\n\"If I can make it,\" Malone said.\n\n\"If you can't,\" Lynch said, \"call me at home.\" He gave Malone the\nnumber, and then added, \"Whatever information I get, I can keep for my\nown use this time, can't I?\"\n\n\"Hell,\" Malone said, \"you've already got all the information you're\ngoing to get. I just gave it to you.\"\n\n\"That,\" Lynch said, \"we'll see.\"\n\n\"I'll call to collect my money,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well talk about it later,\" Lynch said. \"Farewell, old pal.\"\n\n\"Flights of angels,\" Malone said, \"sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\nMalone replaced the microphone and headed for the door. Halfway there,\nhowever, he stopped. He hadn't had any tequila in a long time, and he\nthought he owed it to himself. He felt he had come out ahead in his\nexchange with Lynch, and another medal was in order.\n\nOnly a small one, though. He told himself that he would order one\ntequila and quit. Besides, he had to meet Dorothy.\n\nHe sat down on one of the tall bar stools. The bartender bustled over\nand eyed him speculatively.\n\n_\"Tequila con limon,\"_ he said negligently.\n\n\"Ah,\" the bartender said. _\"Si, se\u00f1or.\"_\n\nMalone waited with ill-concealed impatience. At last it arrived,\nMalone took the small glass of tequila in his right hand, with the\nslice of lemon held firmly between the index and middle fingers of the\nsame hand, the rind facing in toward the glass. On the web between the\nthumb and forefinger of his left hand he had sprinkled a little salt.\nMoving adroitly and with dispatch, he downed the tequila, licked off\nthe salt, and bit his teeth into the lemon slice.\n\nIt felt better than good; it felt wonderful. He hadn't had such a good\ntime in years.\n\nHe had three more before he left the Xochitl.\n\nThen, noticing the time, he moved in a hurry and got out of the bar\nbefore temptation overcame him and he started ordering still more. It\nwas nearly six o'clock, and he had to meet Dorothy at Topp's.\n\nHe hoped he could find it.\n\nHe headed downtown toward 42nd Street, turned right and, sure enough,\nthere was a big red sign. It said Topp's. Malone beamed his approval\nat it. It was just where it ought to be, and he was grateful.\n\nHe pushed open the glass door of the place and went in.\n\nThe ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel was a chunky man with a pleasant face, a receding\nhairline and, some distance back on his head, dark curly hair. He\nbeamed at Malone as if the FBI agent were a long-lost brother. \"Table\nfor one, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said, peering into the place. It was much bigger than he\nhad expected. \"No,\" he said again. \"I guess I'll just have a drink at\nthe bar.\"\n\nThe ma\u00eetre d' smiled and bowed him to a bar stool. Malone sat down and\nlooked the place over again. His first glance had shown him that\nDorothy wasn't there yet, but he saw no harm in making sure. _Always\nbe careful of your facts_, he admonished himself a little fuzzily.\n\nThere were a lot of women in the place, but they were all with\nescorts. Some of them had two escorts, and Malone wondered about them.\nWere they drunk, or was he? It was obvious that someone was seeing\ndouble, but Malone wasn't quite sure who.\n\nHe stared at his face in the bar mirror for a few seconds, and ordered\na bourbon and soda when a bartender came over and occluded the image.\nThe bartender went away and Malone went on studying himself.\n\nHe wasn't bad looking for an FBI agent. He was taller than his father,\nanyway, and less heavily built. That was one good thing. As a matter\nof fact, Malone told himself, he was really a pretty good-looking guy.\n\nSo why did women keep him waiting?\n\nHe heard her voice before he saw her. But she wasn't talking to him.\n\n\"Hello, Milty,\" she said. \"How's everything?\"\n\nMalone turned around to get a look at Milty. He turned out to be the\nma\u00eetre d'. What did he have that Malone didn't have? the agent asked\nhimself sourly. Obviously Dorothy was captivated by his charm. Well,\nthat showed him what city girls were like. Butterflies. Social\nbutterflies. Flitting hither and yon with the wind, now attracted to\nthis man, now to that. Once, Malone told himself sadly, he had known\nthis beautiful woman. Now she belonged to someone else.\n\nHe felt a little bit sad about it, but he told himself to buck up and\nlearn to live with his tragedy. He drank some more of his bourbon and\nsoda, and then she noticed him.\n\nHe heard her say, \"Oh. Excuse me, Milty. There's my man.\" She came\nover and sat down next to him.\n\nHe wanted to ignore her, just to teach her a lesson. But he had\nalready turned around and smiled at her, and she smiled back.\n\n\"Hi,\" she said. \"Did you get the tickets?\"\n\n_Tickets._\n\nMalone knew there was something he'd forgotten, and now he knew what\nit was. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Sure. Just a second. I've got to check up.\"\n\n\"Check up?\"\n\n\"Friend of mine,\" Malone improvised hurriedly. \"Bringing them.\" He\ngave Dorothy a big smile and climbed down off the bar stool. He\nmanaged to find a phone booth, and dialed FBI headquarters on 69th\nStreet and blessed several saints when he found that the A-in-C was\nstill there.\n\n\"Tickets,\" Malone said.\n\nThe Agent-in-Charge blinked at him. \"What tickets?\" he said.\n\n\"The _Hot Seat_ tickets,\" Malone said. \"Did you get 'em?\"\n\n\"I got 'em,\" the Agent-in-Charge said sourly. \"Had to chase all over\ntown and pull more wires than there are on a grand piano. But they\nturned up, brother. Two seats. Do you know what a job like that\nentails?\"\n\n\"I'm grateful,\" Malone said. \"I'm hysterical with gratitude.\"\n\n\"I'd rather track down a gang of fingerless second-story men than go\nthrough that again,\" the Agent-in-Charge said. He looked as if his\nstomach trouble had suddenly gotten a great deal worse. Malone thought\nthat the A-in-C was considering calling a doctor, and would probably\ndecide to make it the undertaker instead, and save the price of a\ncall.\n\n\"I can't express my gratitude,\" Malone told him. \"Where are they?\nWhere do I pick them up?\"\n\n\"Box office,\" the A-in-C said sourly. \"I tell you, everybody in\nWashington must be nuts. The things I have to go through--\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"Thanks a lot. Thanks a million. If there's\never anything I can do for you, let me know and I'll do it.\" He hung\nup and went back to the bar, walking very carefully.\n\n\"Well?\" Dorothy said. \"Where do we go tonight? Joe's hot-dog stand? Or\na revival of _The Wild Duck_ in a loft on Bleecker Street?\"\n\nThere was pride in Malone's manner as he stood there on his feet.\nThere was just a touch of hauteur as he said, \"We'll see _Hot Seat_.\"\n\nAnd he was repaid for all of the Agent-in-Charge's efforts. Dorothy's\neyes went wide with appreciation and awe. \"My goodness,\" she said. \"A\nman of his word--and what a tough word, too! Mr. Malone, I\ncongratulate you.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said. \"A mere absolute nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing, the man says,\" Dorothy muttered. \"My goodness. And modest,\ntoo. Tell me, how do you do, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said. \"Very well, so far.\" He finished his drink. \"And\nyou?\"\n\n\"I work at it,\" she said cryptically.\n\n\"May I have another drink?\"\n\nMalone gave her a grin. \"Another?\" he said. \"Have two. Have a dozen.\"\n\n\"And what,\" she said, \"would I do with a dozen drinks? Don't answer. I\nthink I can guess. But let's just take them one at a time, okay?\" She\nsignaled to the bartender. \"Wally, I'll have a martini. And Mr. Malone\nwill have whatever it is he has, I imagine.\"\n\n\"Bourbon and soda,\" Malone said, and gave the bartender a grin too,\njust to make sure he didn't feel left out. The sun was shining\n(although it was evening outside), and the birds were singing\n(although, Malone reflected, catching a bird on 42nd Street and\nBroadway might take a bit of doing), and all was well with the world.\n\nThere was only a tiny, nagging, disturbing thought in his mind. It had\nto do with Mike Fueyo and the Silent Spooks, and a lot of red\nCadillacs. But he pushed it resolutely away. It had nothing to do with\nthe evening he was about to spend. Nothing at all.\n\nAfter all, this _was_ supposed to be a vacation, wasn't it?\n\n\"Well, Mr. Malone,\" Dorothy said, when the drinks had arrived.\n\n\"Very well indeed,\" Malone said, raising his. \"And just call me Ken.\nDidn't I tell you that once before?\"\n\n\"You did,\" she said. \"And I asked you to call me Dorothy. Not Dotty.\nTry and remember that.\"\n\n\"I will remember it,\" Malone said, \"just as long as ever I live. You\ndon't look the least bit dotty, anyhow. Which is probably more than\nanybody could say for me.\" He started to look at himself in the bar\nmirror again, and decided not to. \"By the way,\" he added, as a sudden\nthought struck him. \"Dotty what?\"\n\n\"Now,\" she said. \"There you go doing it.\"\n\n\"Doing what?\"\n\n\"Calling me that name.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Make it Dorothy. Dorothy what?\" He blinked. \"I\nmean, I know you've got a last name. Dorothy Something. Only it\nprobably isn't Something. What is it?\"\n\n\"Francis,\" she said obligingly. \"Dorothy Francis. My middle name is\nSomething, in case you ever want to call me by my middle name. Just\nyell, 'Hey, Something,' and I'll come a-running. Unless I have\nsomething else to do. In which case everything will be very simple: I\nwon't come.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said doubtfully. \"And what do--\"\n\n\"What do I do?\" she said. \"A standard question. Number two of a\nseries. I do modeling. Photographic modeling. And that's not all; I\nalso do commercials on 3-D. If I look familiar to you, it's probably\nbecause you've seen me on 3-D. Do I look familiar to you?\"\n\n\"I never watch 3-D,\" Malone said, crestfallen.\n\n\"Fine,\" Dorothy said unexpectedly. \"You have excellent taste.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"it's just that I never seem to get the time--\"\n\n\"Don't apologize for it,\" Dorothy said. \"I have to appear on it, but I\ndon't have to like it. And now that I've answered your questions, how\nabout answering some of mine.\"\n\n\"Gladly,\" Malone said. \"The inmost secrets of the FBI are yours for\nthe asking.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Dorothy said slowly. \"What do you do as an FBI agent, anyhow?\nDig up spies?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Malone said. \"We've got enough trouble with the live ones.\nWe don't go around digging anybody up. Believe me.\" He paused, feeling\ndimly that the conversation was beginning to get out of control. \"Have\nI told you that you are the most beautiful woman I've ever met?\" he\nsaid at last.\n\n\"No,\" Dorothy said. \"Not yet, anyway. But I was expecting it.\"\n\n\"You were?\" Malone said, disappointed.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Dorothy said. \"You've been drinking. As a matter of fact,\nyou've managed to get quite a head start.\"\n\nMalone hung his head guiltily. \"True,\" he said in a low voice. \"Too\ntrue. Much too true.\"\n\nDorothy nodded, downed her drink and waved to the bartender. \"Wally,\nbring me a double this time.\"\n\n\"A double?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Dorothy said. \"I've got to do some fast catching-up on Mr.\nMalone here.\"\n\n\"Call me Ken,\" Malone muttered.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Dorothy told him. \"Wally hardly knows you. He'll\ncall you Mr. Malone and like it.\"\n\nThe bartender went away, and Malone sat on his stool and thought\nbusily for a minute. At last he said, \"If you really want to catch up\nwith me...\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Dorothy said.\n\n\"Better have a triple,\" Malone muttered.\n\nDorothy's eyebrows rose slightly.\n\n\"Because I intend to have another one,\" Malone added. \"And even then\nyou'll be just a little behind.\"\n\n\"That sounds sort of sad, in a way,\" Dorothy said. \"Just a little\nbehind. Tell me, is that a compliment or an insult?\"\n\n\"Both,\" Malone said instantly. \"And an observation, too.\"\n\nDorothy nodded. \"I can see why you're a Federal cop,\" she said.\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said. \"I didn't know it showed. Why?\"\n\n\"You're good at observing,\" she said. \"Like this morning, for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. He searched in his mind for a quotation and found\nit. \"If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee,\" he\nsaid triumphantly.\n\n\"Sounds sort of grisly,\" Dorothy said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I can't help it,\" he said. \"That's what it says.\"\n\n\"Well?\" Dorothy said. \"Did you?\"\n\n\"Did I what?\"\n\n\"Pluck your eye out and cast it from you?\"\n\n\"Didn't have to,\" Malone said. \"Mine eye did not offend me.\" He\nblinked and added, \"Far from it.\"\n\n\"I guess we'll just have to leave it unplucked,\" Dorothy said sadly.\n\"It didn't offend me, either.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said, and the bartender brought drinks.\n\nMalone picked his up and held it in the air. \"I propose a toast,\" he\nsaid.\n\nDorothy picked up her glass. \"A toast?\"\n\n\"An old German toast, as a matter of fact,\" Malone said.\n\nHe fell silent. After a few seconds Dorothy said, \"Well? Go ahead.\"\n\n_\"Zwieback!\"_ Malone said, bowed carefully to Dorothy and drained his\nglass with a flourish.\n\n\n                                  7\n\nIt started a million years ago.\n\nIn that distant past, a handful of photons deep in the interior of Sol\nbegan their random journey to the photosphere. They had been born as\nultrahard gamma radiation, and they were positively bursting with\nenergy, attempting to push their respective ways through the dense\nnucleonic gas that had been their womb. Within millimicroseconds, they\nhad been swallowed up by the various particles surrounding\nthem--swallowed, and emitted again, as the particles met in violent\ncollision.\n\nAnd then the process was repeated. After a thousand thousand years,\nand billions on billions of such repetitions, the handful of photons\nreached the relatively cool photosphere of the sun. But the long\nbattle had taken some of the drive out of them; over the past million\nyears, even the strongest had become only hard ultraviolet, and the\nweakest just sputtered out in the form of long radio waves.\n\nBut now, at last, they were free! And in the first flush of this\nnewfound freedom, they flung themselves over ninety-three million\nmiles of space, traveling at one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles\na second, and making the entire trip in less than eight and one-half\nminutes.\n\nThey struck the earth's ionosphere, and their numbers diminished. The\nhard ultraviolet was gobbled up by ozone; much of the blue was\nscattered through the atmosphere. The remainder bore steadily onward.\n\nDown through the air they came, only slightly weakened this time. They\nhit the glass of a window in the Hotel New Yorker, losing more of\ntheir members in the plunge.\n\nAnd, a few feet from the glass, they ended their million-year epic by\nilluminating a face.\n\nThe face responded to them with something less than pleasure. It was\nclear that the face did not like being illuminated. The light was very\nbright, much too bright. It seemed to be searing its way through the\nface's closed eyelids, right past the optic nerves into the brain-pan\nitself. The face twisted in a sudden spasm, as if its brain were\nshriveling with heat. Its owner thoughtfully turned over, and the face\nsought the seclusion and comparative darkness of a pillow.\n\nUnfortunately, the motion brought the face's owner to complete\nwakefulness. He did not want to be awake, but he had very little\nchoice in the matter. Even though his face was no longer being\nilluminated, he could feel other rays of sunlight eating at the back\nof his head. He put the pillow over his head and felt more comfortable\nfor a space, but this slight relief passed, too.\n\nHe thought about mausoleums. Mausoleums were nice, cool, dark places\nwhere there was never any sun or heat, and never any reason to wake\nup. Maybe, he told himself cunningly, if he went to sleep again he\nwould wake up dead, in a mausoleum. That, he thought, would be nice.\n\nDeath was nice and pleasant. Unfortunately, he realized, he was not\ndead. And there was absolutely no chance of his ever getting back to\nsleep. He finally rolled over again, being very careful to avoid any\nmore poisonous sunlight. Getting up was an even more difficult\nprocess, but Malone knew it had to be managed. Somehow he got his feet\nfirmly planted on the floor and sat up.\n\nIt had been a remarkable feat, he told himself. He deserved a medal.\n\nThat reminded him of the night before. He had been thinking quite a\nlot about the medals he deserved for various feats. He had even\nawarded some of them to himself, in the shape of liquid decoctions.\n\nHe remembered all that quite well. There were a lot of cloudy things\nin his mind, but from all the testimony he could gather, he imagined\nthat he'd had quite a time the night before. Quite a wonderful time,\nas a matter of fact.\n\nNot that that reflection did anything for him now. As he opened his\neyes, one at a time, he thought of Boyd. Once, long ago, ages and ages\nago, he had had to wake Boyd up, and he recalled how rough he had been\nabout it. That had been unforgivable.\n\nHe made a mental note to apologize to Boyd the next time he saw\nhim--if he could ever see again. Now, he knew how Boyd had felt. And\nit was terrible.\n\nStill sitting on the bed, he told himself that, in spite of\neverything, he was lucky. To judge by his vague memories, he'd had\nquite a time the night before, and if the hangover was payment for it,\nthen he was willing to accept the payment. Almost. Because it had\nreally been a terrific time. The only nagging thought in his mind was\nthat there had been something vital he'd forgotten.\n\n\"Tickets,\" he said aloud, and was surprised that his voice was\naudible. As a matter of fact, it was too audible; the noise made him\nwince slightly. He shifted his position very quietly.\n\nAnd he hadn't forgotten the tickets. No. He distinctly remembered\ngoing to see _The Hot Seat_, and finding seats, and actually sitting\nthrough the show with Dorothy at his side. He couldn't honestly say\nthat he remembered much of the show itself, but that couldn't be the\nimportant thing he'd forgotten. By no means.\n\nHe had heard that it was a good show, though. Sometime, he reminded\nhimself, he would have to get tickets and actually see it.\n\nHe checked through the evening. Drinks. Dinner ... he had had dinner,\nhadn't he? Yes, he had. He recalled a broiled sea bass looking up at\nhim with mournful eyes. He couldn't have dreamed anything like that.\n\nAnd then the theater, and after that some more drinks ... and so on,\nand so on, and so on, right to his arrival back in his hotel room, at\nfour-thirty in the morning, on a bright, boiled cloud.\n\nHe even remembered arguing with Dorothy about taking her home. She'd\nwon that round by ducking into a subway entrance, and he had turned\naround after she'd left him and headed for home. Had he taken a taxi?\n\nYes, Malone decided, he had. He even remembered that.\n\nThen what had he forgotten?\n\nHe had met Dorothy, he told himself, starting all over again in an\neffort to locate the gaps, at six o'clock, right after phoning...\n\n\"My God!\" Malone said, and winced. He looked at his watch. It was ten\no'clock in the morning. He had completely forgotten to call Fernack\nand Lynch.\n\nHangover or no hangover, Malone told himself grimly, there was work to\nbe done. Somehow, he managed to get to his feet and start moving.\n\nHe checked Boyd's room after a while. But his partner wasn't home.\n_Probably at work already_, Malone thought, _while I lie here useless\nand helpless._ He thought of the Sermon on the Evils of Alcohol, and\ndecided he'd better read it to himself instead of delivering it to\nBoyd.\n\nBut he didn't waste any time with it. By ten-fifteen he was showered\nand shaved, his teeth were brushed, and he was dressed. He felt, he\nestimated, about fifteen hundred per cent better. That was still\nlousy, but it wasn't quite as bad as it had been. He could move around\nand talk and even think a little, if he was careful about it. Before\nhe left, he took a look at himself in the mirror.\n\nWell, he told himself, that was nice.\n\nIt hardly showed at all. He looked tired, to be sure, but that was\nalmost normal. The eyes weren't bloodshot red, and didn't seem to bug\nout at all, although Malone would have sworn that they were bleeding\nall over his face. His head was its normal size, as near as he\nremembered; it was not swollen visibly, or pulsing like a jellyfish at\nevery move.\n\nHe looked even better than he felt.\n\nHe started for the door, and then stopped himself. There was no need\nto go out so early; he could start work right in his own hotel room\nand not even have to worry about the streets of New York, the cars or\nthe pedestrians for a while.\n\nHe thought wistfully about a hair of the hound, decided against it\nwith great firmness, and sat down to the phone.\n\nHe dialed a number, and the face of Commissioner Fernack appeared\nalmost at once. Malone forced himself to smile cheerfully, reasonably\nsure that he was going to crack something as he did it. \"Hello, John\nHenry,\" he said in what he hoped was a good imitation of a happy,\ncarefree voice. \"And how are you this lovely morning?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Fernack said sourly. \"I'm in great shape. Tiptop. Dancing in the\ngoddamn daisies. Malone, how did you--\"\n\n\"Any news for me?\" Malone said.\n\nFernack waited a long time before he answered, and when he did his\nvoice was dangerously soft and calm. \"Malone,\" he said, \"when you\nasked for this survey, just what kind of news did you expect to get?\"\n\n\"A godawful lot of impossible crimes,\" Malone said frankly. \"How did I\ndo, John Henry?\"\n\n\"You did damn well,\" Fernack said. \"Too damn well. Listen, Malone, how\ncould you know about anything like this?\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Well,\" he said, \"we have our sources. Confidential.\nTop secret. I'm sure you understand, Commissioner.\" Hurriedly, he\nadded, \"What does the breakdown look like?\"\n\n\"It looks like hell,\" Fernack said. \"About eight months ago, according\nto the computer, there was a terrific upswing in certain kinds of\ncrime. And since then it's been pretty steady, right at the top of the\nswing. Hasn't moved down hardly at all.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said.\n\nFernack stared. \"What?\" he said.\n\n\"I mean--\" Malone stopped, thought of an answer and tried it. \"I mean,\nthat checks out my guess. My information. Sources.\"\n\nFernack seemed to weigh risks in his mind. \"Malone, I know you're\nFBI,\" he said at last. \"But this sounds pretty fishy to me. Pretty\nstrange.\"\n\n\"You have no idea how strange,\" Malone said truthfully.\n\n\"I'm beginning to,\" Fernack said. \"And if I ever find out that you had\nanything to do with this--\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"And don't look innocent,\" Fernack said. \"It doesn't succeed in\nlooking anything but horrible. You remind me of a convicted murderer\ntrying to steal thirty cents from the prison chaplain.\"\n\n\"What would I have to do with all these crimes?\" Malone said. \"And\nwhat kind of crimes were they, anyway?\"\n\n\"What you'd have to do with them,\" Fernack said, \"is an unanswered\nquestion. And so long as it remains unanswered, Malone, you're safe.\nBut when I come up with enough facts to answer it--\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. Commissioner,\" Malone said. \"How about those crimes?\nWhat kind were they?\"\n\n\"Burglaries,\" Fernack said. \"And I have a hunch you know that well\nenough. Most of them were just burglaries--locked barrooms, for\ninstance, early in the morning. There's never any sign of tampering\nwith the locks, no sign of breaking and entering, no sign of any\nalarms being tampered with in any way. But the money's gone from the\ncash register, and all of the liquor is gone too.\"\n\nMalone stared. \"_All_ the liquor?\" he said in a dazed voice.\n\n\"Well,\" Fernack said, \"all of it that's in plain sight, anyway. Except\nfor the open bottles. Disappeared. Gone. Without a trace. And most of\nthe time the extra stock's gone too, from the basement or wherever\nthey happen to keep it.\"\n\n\"That's a lot of liquor,\" Malone said.\n\n\"A hell of a lot,\" Fernack said. \"Some of the bars have gone broke,\nnot being insured against the losses.\"\n\nThe thought of thousands of bottles of liquor--millions of\nbottles--went through Malone's mind like an ice pick. He could almost\nsee them, handle them, taste them. \"Hair of the dog,\" he muttered.\n\"What hair. What a dog.\"\n\n\"What did you say, Malone?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said hastily. \"Nothing at all.\" After a second\nanother query occurred to him. \"You mean to tell me that only bars\nwere robbed? Nothing else?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Fernack said. \"Bars are only part of it. Malone, why are you\nasking me to tell you this?\"\n\n\"Because I want to know,\" Malone said patiently.\n\n\"I still think--\" Fernack began, and then said, \"Never mind.. But it\nhasn't been only bars. Supermarkets. Homes. Cleaning and tailoring\nshops. Jewelers. Hell, Malone, you name it and it's been hit.\"\n\nMalone tried valiantly to resist temptation, but he was not at his\nbest, and he lost. \"All right,\" he said. \"I will name it. Here's a\nlist of places that haven't even been touched by the rising crime\nwave. Banks, for one.\"\n\n\"Malone!\"\n\n\"Safes that have been locked, for another,\" Malone went on. \"Homes\nwith wall safes, though that's not quite accurate. The homes may have\nbeen robbed, but the safes won't have been touched.\"\n\n\"Malone, how much do you know?\" Fernack said. \"My God, man--\"\n\n\"I'll make a general rule for you,\" Malone said. \"Any place that fits\nthe following description is safe: it's got a secure lock on it, and\nit's too small for a human being to get into.\"\n\nFernack opened his mouth, shut it, and stared downward, obviously\nscanning some papers lying on the desk in front of him. Malone waited\npatiently for the explosion, but it never came.\n\nInstead, Fernack said, \"You know, Malone, you remind me of an old\nfriend of mine.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said pleasantly.\n\n\"You certainly do,\" Fernack said. \"There's just one small difference.\nYou're an FBI man, and he's a crook. If that's a difference.\"\n\n\"It is,\" Malone said. \"And on behalf of the FBI, I resent the\nallegation. And, as a matter of fact, defy the allegator. But that's\nneither here nor there,\" he continued. \"If that's the difference, what\nare the similarities?\"\n\nFernack drew in a deep, hissing breath, and when he spoke his voice\nwas as calm and quiet as a coiled cobra. \"The both of you come up with\nthe goddamnedest answers to things. Things I never knew about or even\ncared about before. Things I wish I'd never heard of. Things that\ndon't have any explanation. And--\" He stopped, his face dark in the\nscreen. Malone wondered what color it was going to turn, and decided\non purple as a good choice.\n\n\"Well?\" Malone said at last.\n\n\"And you're always so goddamned right it makes me sick,\" Fernack\nfinished flatly. He rubbed a hand through his hair and stared into the\nscreen at Malone. \"How did you know all this stuff?\" he said.\n\nMalone waited one full second, while Fernack got darker and darker on\nthe screen. When he judged that the color was right, he said quietly,\n\"I'm prescient. And thanks a lot, John Henry; just send the reports to\nme personally, at 69th Street. By messenger. So long.\"\n\nHe cut the circuit just as Fernack started: \"Now, Malone--\"\n\nWith a satisfied, somewhat sheepish smile, Malone dialed another\nnumber. This time a desk sergeant told him politely that Lynch wasn't\nat the precinct, and wouldn't arrive until noon.\n\nMalone had Lynch's home number. He dialed it.\n\nIt was a long wait before the lieutenant answered, and he didn't look\nmuch like a police officer when his face finally showed up on the\nscreen. His hair was uncombed and he was unshaven. His eyes were\nslightly bleary, but he was definitely awake.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hi, there,\" Lynch said with enormous cheerfulness. \"Old buddy-boy.\nOld pal. Old friend.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Wrong?\" Lynch said. \"Nothing. Nothing. Nothing at all. I just wanted\nto thank you for not waking me up last night. I only waited for your\ncall until midnight. Then I decided I just wasn't very important to\nyou. You obviously had much bigger things on your mind.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" Malone said, speculatively eying Lynch's\nfigure, dressed in a pair of trousers and a T-shirt, \"you're right.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" Lynch said. \"And I decided that, since you\nwere so terribly busy, it could wait until I woke up. Or even until I\ngot down to the station. How about it, _buddy-boy_?\"\n\n\"Listen, Lynch,\" Malone said, \"we made a bet. Ten to one. I just want\nto know if I can come down to collect or not.\"\n\nThere was a second of silence.\n\n\"All right,\" Lynch said at last, looking crestfallen. \"I owe you a\nbuck. Every last one of those kids has skipped out on us.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. He wondered briefly just what was good about it,\nand decided he'd rather have lost the money to Lynch. But facts, he\nreflected, were facts. Thoroughly nasty facts.\n\n\"I spent all night tracing them,\" Lynch said. \"Got nowhere. Nowhere at\nall. Malone, how did you know--\"\n\n\"Classified,\" Malone said. \"Very classified. But you're sure they're\nall gone? Vanished?\"\n\nLynch's face reddened. \"Sure I'm sure,\" he said. \"Every last one of\nthem is gone. And what more do you want me to do about it?\" He paused,\nthen added, \"What do you expect, Malone? Miracles?\"\n\nMalone shook his head gently. \"No,\" he said. \"I--\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind,\" Lynch said. \"But I--\"\n\n\"Look, Malone,\" Lynch said, \"there's a guy who wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\"One of the Silent Spooks?\" Malone said hopefully.\n\nLynch shook his head and made a growling noise. \"Don't be silly,\" he\nsaid. \"It's just that this guy might have some information, but he\nwon't say anything to me about it. He's a social worker or something\nlike that.\"\n\n\"Social worker?\" Malone said. \"He works with the kids, right?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" Lynch said. \"His name's Kettleman. Albert Kettleman.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I'll be right over.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Lynch said, \"hold on. He's not here now. What do you think this\nis--my house or a reception center?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone said wearily. \"Where and when?\"\n\n\"How about three o'clock at the precinct station?\" Lynch said. \"I can\nhave him there by then, and you can get together and talk.\" He paused.\n\"Nobody likes the cops,\" he said. \"People hear the FBI's mixed up in\nthis, and they figure the cops are all second-stringers or something.\"\n\n\"Sorry to hear it,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll bet you are,\" Lynch told him bitterly.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Anyway,\" he said, \"I'll see you at three, right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Lynch said, and Malone flipped off.\n\nHe sat there for a few seconds, grinning quietly. His brain throbbed\nlike an overheated motor, but he didn't really mind any more. His\ntheory had been justified, and that was the most important thing.\n\nThe Silent Spooks were all teleports.\n\nEight of them--eight kids on the loose, stealing everything they could\nlay their hands on, and completely safe. How could you catch a boy who\njust disappeared when you started for him? No wonder their names\nhadn't appeared on the police blotter, Malone thought.\n\nSpooks didn't get into trouble. They didn't have to.\n\nThey could get into any place big enough to hold them, take what they\nwanted and just disappear. They'd been doing it for about eight\nmonths, according to the figures Malone had received from Fernack;\nmaybe teleportative ability didn't develop until you were around\nfourteen or fifteen.\n\nBut it had developed in these kids--and they were using it in the most\nobvious way. They had a sure method of getting away from the cops, and\na sure method of taking anything they wanted. No wonder they had so\nmuch money.\n\nMalone got up, feeling slightly dazed, and left the hotel room.\n\n\n                                  8\n\nBy three o'clock, he was again among the living. Maybe his occupations\nhad had something to do with it; he'd spent about four hours\nsupervising Operation Dismemberment, and then listening to the reports\non the dismantled Cadillacs. It was nice, peaceful, unimportant work,\nbut there just wasn't anything else to do. FBI work was ninety-five\nper cent marking time, anyway. Malone felt grateful that there was any\naction at all in what he was doing.\n\nDr. Leibowitz had found all sort of things in the commandeered\nCaddies--everything from guns and narcotics to pornographic pictures\nin lots of three hundred, for shipment into New York City from the\nsuburbs where the processing plant probably was. Of course, there had\nbeen personal effects, too--maps and lucky dolls and, just once, a\nsingle crutch.\n\nMalone wondered about that for quite a while. Who'd just walk off and\nleave one crutch in a car? But people did things like that all the\ntime, he finally told himself heavily. There wasn't any explanation\nfor it, and there probably never would be.\n\nBut in spite of the majestic assortment of valuables found in the\ncars, there was no sign of anything remotely resembling an\nelectro-psionic brain. Dr. Leibowitz had found just about everything--\nexcept what he was looking for.\n\nAt a quarter to three, Malone gave up. The search wasn't quite\nfinished, but he'd heard enough to last him for a long time. He\ngrabbed a cab downstairs and went over to Lynch's office to meet\nKettleman.\n\nThe \"social worker or something\" was a large, balding man about six\nfeet tall. Malone estimated his weight as close to two hundred and\nfifty pounds, and he looked every pound of it; his face was round\nwithout being chubby, and his body was stocky and hard. He wore\nblack-rimmed glasses, and he was going bald in front. His face was\nlike a mask; it was held in a gentle, almost eager expression that\nMalone would have sworn had nothing to do with the way Kettleman felt\nunderneath.\n\nLynch performed the introductions, escorted the two of them to one of\nthe interrogation rooms at the rear of the station, and left them\nthere, with, \"If either of you guys comes up with anything, let me\nknow,\" for a parting shot.\n\nKettleman blinked slowly behind his glasses. \"Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"I\nunderstand that the FBI is interested in one of the--ah--adolescent\nsocial groups with which I work.\"\n\n\"Well, the Silent Spooks,\" Malone said. \"That's right.\"\n\n\"The Spooks,\" Kettleman said. His voice was rather higher than Malone\nwould have expected, oddly breathy without much depth to it. \"My, yes.\nI did want to talk to somebody about it, and I thought you might be\nthe man.\"\n\n\"I'll be interested in anything you have to say,\" Malone said\ndiplomatically. He was beginning to doubt whether he'd get any real\ninformation out of Kettleman. But it was impossible to tell. He sat\nback in a hard wooden chair and tried to look fascinated.\n\n\"Well,\" Kettleman said tentatively, \"the boys themselves have sort of\na word for it. They'd say that there was something oddball about the\nSpooks. Do you understand? Not just the fact that they never drink\nliquor, but--\"\n\n\"Something strange,\" Malone said. \"Is that what you mean?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Kettleman said. \"_Strange._ Of course.\" He acted, Malone\nthought, as if he had never heard the word before, and was both\npleased and startled by its sound. \"Perhaps I had better explain my\nposition a little more clearly,\" he said. \"That will give you an idea\nof just where I 'fit into' this picture.\"\n\n\"Whatever you think best,\" Malone said, resigning himself to a very\ndull hour. He tried to picture Kettleman in the midst of a gang of\njuvenile delinquents. It was very hard to do.\n\n\"I'm a social worker,\" Kettleman said, \"working on an individual basis\nwith these--social groups that the adolescents have formed. It's my\njob to make friends with them, become accepted by them, and try to\nturn their hostile impulses toward society into more useful, more\nacceptable channels.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone said, feeling that something was expected of him.\n\"That's fine.\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't expect praise, we social workers,\" Kettleman said\ninstantly. \"The worth of a good job well done, that's enough for us.\"\nHe smiled. The effect was a little unsettling, as if a hippopotamus\nhad begun to laugh like a hyena. \"But to continue, Mr. Malone,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said. \"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I've worked with many of the organizations in this neighborhood,\"\nKettleman said. \"And I've been quite successful in getting to know\nthem, and in being accepted by them. Of course, the major part of my\njob is more difficult, but--well, I'm sure that's enough about my own\nbackground. That isn't what you're interested in, now, is it?\"\n\nHe looked penitent. Malone said, \"It's all right. I don't mind.\" He\nshifted positions on the hard chair.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Kettleman said, with the air of a man suddenly getting\ndown to business. He leaned forward eagerly, his eyes big and bright\nbehind the lenses. \"There's something very peculiar about those boys,\"\nhe said in a whisper.\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Very peculiar indeed,\" Kettleman said. \"My, yes. All of the other\nsocial groups are afraid of them.\"\n\n\"Big, huh?\" Malone said. \"Big strong boys who--\"\n\n\"Oh, my, no,\" Kettleman said. \"My goodness, no. All of the Spooks are\nrather slight, as a matter of fact. They've got _something_, but it\nisn't strength.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" Malone said tiredly.\n\n\"I doubt if--in the language of my own groups--any one of the Spooks\ncould punch his way out of a paper bag,\" Kettleman said. \"It's more\nthan that.\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" Malone said, \"I'm inclined to agree with you. But what is\nthis something that frightens everyone else?\"\n\nKettleman leaned even closer. \"I'm not sure,\" he said softly. \"I can't\nsay for certain, Mr. Malone. I've only heard rumors.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"rumors might--\"\n\n\"Rumors are a very powerful force among my groups, Mr. Malone,\"\nKettleman said. \"I've learned, over the years, to keep my ear to the\nground, as it were, and pay very close attention to rumors.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Malone said patiently. \"But what did this particular rumor\nsay?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Kettleman said, and stopped. \"Well,\" he said again. And at\nlast he gulped and got it out. \"Magicians, Mr. Malone. They say the\nSpooks are magicians--that they can come and go at will. Make\nthemselves invisible. All sorts of things. Of course, I don't believe\nthat, but--\"\n\n\"Oh, it's quite true,\" Malone said, solemn faced.\n\n\"It's what?\"\n\n\"Perfectly true,\" Malone said. \"We know all that.\"\n\n\"Oh, my,\" Kettleman said. His face took on a whitish cast. \"Oh, my\ngoodness,\" he said. \"Isn't that--isn't that amazing.\" He swallowed\nhard. \"True all the time,\" he said.\n\n\"Magicians. I--\"\n\n\"You see, this information isn't new to us,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Kettleman said. \"No. Of course not. My. It's--rather\ndisconcerting to think about, isn't it?\"\n\n\"There,\" Malone said, \"I agree with you.\"\n\nKettleman fell silent. Malone offered him a cigarette, but the social\nworker refused with a pale smile, and Malone lit one for himself. He\ntook a couple of puffs in the silence, and then Kettleman said, \"Well,\nMr. Malone, Lieutenant Lynch did say that I was to tell you everything\nI could about these boys.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we all appreciate that,\" Malone said at random, wondering\nexactly what he meant.\n\n\"There is--well, there is one more thing,\" Kettleman said.\n\"Ordinarily, of course, I wouldn't say anything about this to anyone.\nIn my line of work, Mr. Malone, you learn the need for confidence. For\nbeing able to keep one's word.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Malone said, wondering what startling new fact was on its\nway now.\n\n\"And we certainly try to keep the confidence of the boys,\" Kettleman\nsaid maddeningly. \"We wouldn't betray them to the police in any way\nunless it were absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\"Betray them? Mr. Kettleman,\" Malone said, \"just what are you trying\nto tell me?\"\n\n\"It's about their meeting place,\" Kettleman said. \"Oh, my. I'm not at\nall sure I ought to tell you this.\" He wrung his pale fat hands\ntogether and looked at Malone appealingly.\n\n\"Now, now,\" Malone said, feeling foolish. \"It's perfectly all right.\nWe don't want to hurt the Spooks. Not any more than we have to. You\ncan tell me, Mr. Kettleman.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Kettleman said. \"Well, the Spooks do have a sort of secret\nmeeting place, you know. And they meet there.\"\n\nHe stopped. Malone said, \"Where is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a big empty warehouse,\" Kettleman said. \"I really feel\nterrible about this. They're meeting there tonight sometime, or that's\nwhat the rumors say. I shouldn't be telling you--\"\n\n\"Of course you should,\" Malone said, trying to sound reassuring.\n\"Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Kettleman. Tonight?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Kettleman said eagerly. He grinned, and then looked\nmorosely down at his hands.\n\n\"Do you know where this warehouse is?\" Malone said. \"If any of the\nother little social groups use it--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, they don't,\" Kettleman said. \"That's what makes it so funny.\nYou see, the warehouse is deserted, but it's kept in good repair;\nthere are bars on the windows, and it's protected by all sorts of\nalarm systems and things like that. So none of the others can use it.\nOnly the Spooks. You can't get in without a key, not at all.\"\n\n\"But do the Spooks--\" Malone began.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Kettleman moaned. \"They don't have a key. At least, that's\nwhat the other groups say. The Spooks just--just melt borough the\nwalls, or something like that.\"\n\n\"Mr. Kettleman,\" Malone said, \"where is this warehouse?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be telling you this,\" Kettleman said.\n\nMalone sighed. \"Please, Mr. Kettleman. You know we're working for the\ngood of those boys, don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, I--\"\n\n\"Sure we are,\" Malone said. \"So you can tell me.\"\n\nKettleman blinked behind his glasses, and moaned a little. Malone\nwaited with his hands tense in his lap. At last Kettleman said, \"It's\non West Street, near Chambers. That's downtown.\" He gave Malone an\naddress. \"That's where it is,\" he said. \"But you won't do anything to\nthe boys, will you? They're basically good boys. No matter what. And\nthey--\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Mr. Kettleman,\" Malone said. \"We'll take care\nof the Spooks.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Kettleman said. \"Yes. Sure.\"\n\nHe got up. Malone said, \"There's just one more thing, Mr. Kettleman.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The big man's voice had reached the high, breathy pitch of a\nfife.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what time the Spooks usually meet?\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" Kettleman said, \"I don't really know. You see, the reason\nI wanted to tell you all this was because Lieutenant Lynch was\nchecking up on all those boys yesterday, and I thought...\" He stopped\nand cleared his throat, and when he began again his voice had dropped\nalmost to a whisper. \"Well, Mr. Malone, I thought, after all, that\nsince he was asking me questions--you know, questions about where the\nSpooks were, and all of that--since he was asking me questions...\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I thought perhaps I ought to tell you about them,\" Kettleman said.\n\"Where they were, and all of that.\"\n\nMalone stood up. \"Mr. Kettleman,\" he said in his most official voice,\n\"I want you to know that the FBI appreciates what you've done. Your\ninformation will probably be very helpful to us, and the FBI certainly\ncommends you for being public-spirited enough to come to us and tell\nus what you know.\" He thought for a second, and then added, \"In the\nname of the FBI, Mr. Kettleman--well done!\"\n\nKettleman stared, smiled, and gulped. \"My goodness,\" he said. \"Well.\"\nHe smiled again, a little more broadly. \"One has one's duty, you know.\nMy, yes. Duty.\" He nodded to Malone.\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said, going to the door and opening it. \"Thanks\nagain, Mr. Kettleman.\"\n\nKettleman saw the open door and headed for it blindly. As he left he\nflashed one last smile after Malone, who sighed, shut the door, and\nleaned against it for a second.\n\nThe things an FBI agent had to go through!\n\nWhen he had recovered, he opened the door again and peered carefully\ndown the hallway to make sure Kettleman had gone. Then he left the\ninterrogation room and went down the hall, past the desk sergeant, and\nup the stairs to Lieutenant Lynch's office. He was still breathing a\nlittle hard when he opened Lynch's door, and Lynch didn't seem to be\nexpecting him at all. He was very busy with a veritable snow flurry of\npapers, and he looked as if he had been involved with them steadily\never since he had left Malone and Kettleman alone downstairs.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said. \"Hello there, Lieutenant.\"\n\nLynch looked up, his face a mask of surprise. \"Oh,\" he said. \"It's\nyou. Through with Kettleman?\"\n\n\"I'm through,\" Malone said. \"As if you didn't know.\" He looked at\nLynch for a long minute, and then said, \"Lieutenant...\"\n\nLynch had gone right back to his papers. He looked up again with a\nbland expression. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Lieutenant, how reliable is Kettleman?\" Malone said.\n\nLynch shrugged. \"He's always been pretty good with the kids, if that's\nwhat you mean. You know these social workers--I've never got much\ninformation out of him. He feels it's his duty to the kids--I don't\nknow. Some such thing. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"what he told me. Was he kidding me? Or does he\nknow what he's talking about? Was what he said reasonably accurate?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\" Lynch said. \"After all, you were down there alone,\nweren't you? I was up here working. If you'll tell me what he said,\nmaybe I'll be able to tell you whether or not I think he was kidding.\"\n\nMalone placed both his palms on the lieutenant's desk, mashing a\ncouple of piles of papers. He leaned forward slowly, his eyes on\nLynch's bland, innocent face. \"Now look, Lynch,\" he said. \"I like you.\nI really do. You're a good cop. You get things done.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks,\" Lynch said. \"But I don't see what this has to do\nwith--\"\n\n\"I just don't want you trying to kid your buddy-boy,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Kid you?\" Lynch said. \"I don't get it.\"\n\n\"Come on, now,\" Malone said. \"I know that room was bugged, just as\nwell as you do. It was the sensible thing for you to pull, and you\npulled it. You've got the whole thing recorded, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Lynch said. \"Why would I--\"\n\n\"Oh, cut it out,\" Malone said impatiently. \"Let's not play games,\nokay?\"\n\nThere was a second of silence.\n\n\"All right,\" Lynch said. \"So I recorded the conversation. Kill me.\nCrucify me. I'm stealing FBI secrets. I'm a spy secretly working for a\nforeign power. Take me out and electrocute me.\"\n\n\"I don't want to fight you,\" Malone said wearily. \"So you've got the\nstuff recorded. That's your business.\"\n\n\"My business?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"As long as you don't try to use it.\"\n\n\"Now, Malone--\" Lynch began.\n\n\"This is touchy stuff,\" Malone said. \"We're going to have to take a\nlot of care in handling it. And I don't want you throwing raids all\nover the place and mixing everything up.\"\n\n\"Malone, I--\"\n\n\"Eventually,\" Malone said, \"I'm going to need your help with these\nkids. But for right now, I want to handle this my way, without any\ninterference.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of--\"\n\n\"You wanted information,\" Malone said. \"Fine. That's all right with\nme. You got the information, and that's okay too. But if you try to\nuse it before I say the word, I'll--I'll talk to good old Uncle John\nHenry Fernack. And he'll help me out; he'll give you a refresher\ncourse on How To Be A Beat Cop. In Kew Gardens. It's nice and lonely\nout there now, Lynch, You'd love it.\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Lynch said tiredly.\n\n\"Don't give me any arguments,\" Malone said. \"I don't want any\narguments.\"\n\n\"I won't argue with you, Malone,\" Lynch said. \"I've been trying to\ntell you something.\"\n\nMalone stepped away from the desk. \"All right,\" he said. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nLynch took a deep breath. \"Malone, I'm not trying to queer your\npitch,\" he said. \"If I were going to pull a raid, here's what I'd have\nto do: get my own cops together, then call the precinct that covers\nthat old warehouse. We don't cover the warehouse from here, Malone,\nand we'd need the responsible precinct's aid in anything we did down\nthere.\"\n\nMalone said, \"Well, all I--\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" Lynch said. \"I'd have to call Safe and Loft, and get\nthem in on it. A warehouse raid would probably be their baby first of\nall. That means it takes this precinct, the warehouse precinct, and\nthe Safe and Loft Squad, all together, to raid that warehouse. Malone,\nwould I pull a raid at this stage, if I had to go through all that,\nwithout knowing what the hell I was going to find down there?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"If those kids can just appear and disappear at will,\" Lynch said,\n\"I'm not going to pull a raid on them, and end up looking like a damn\nfool, until I've got some way of making sure they're there when the\nraid goes through.\"\n\nMalone coughed gently. \"Okay,\" he said at last. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing I want,\" Lynch said. \"I want to be able to\nmove as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" Malone said apologetically.\n\n\"And that means I'm going to have to be informed,\" Lynch said. \"I want\nto know what's going on, as fast as possible.\"\n\nMalone nodded gently. \"Sure,\" he said. \"I'll tell you everything that\nhappens--as soon as I know myself. But right now, I haven't got a\nthing for you. All I have is a kind of theory, and it's pretty\nscrewy.\"\n\nHe stopped. Lynch looked up at him. \"How screwy can it get?\" he said.\n\"The facts are nutty enough.\"\n\n\"You have absolutely no idea,\" Malone assured him. \"I'm not even\nsaying a word about this, not until I prove it out one way or another.\nI'm not even thinking about it--not until it stops sounding so nutty\nto me.\"\n\n\"Okay, Malone,\" Lynch said. \"I can see a piece of it, if no more. The\nFueyo kid vanishes mysteriously--never mind all that about you getting\nhim out of the interrogation room by some kind of confidential method.\nThere isn't any confidential method. I know that better than you do.\"\n\n\"I had to say something, didn't I?\" Malone asked apologetically.\n\n\"So the kid disappears,\" Lynch said, brushing Malone's question away\nwith a wave of his hand. \"So now I hear all this stuff from Kettleman.\nAnd it begins to add up. The kids can disappear somehow, and reappear\nsome place else. Walk through walls?\" He shrugged. \"How should I know?\nBut they can sure as hell do something like it.\"\n\n\"Something,\" Malone said. \"Like I said, it sounds screwy.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"Nobody likes it,\" he said. \"But keep it under your\nhat. I'll give you everything I have--whenever I have anything. And by\nthe way--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Thanks for giving me and Kettleman a chance to talk,\" Malone said.\n\"Even if you had reasons of your own.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Lynch said. \"You mean the recording.\"\n\n\"I was a little suspicious,\" Malone said. \"I didn't think you'd give\nKettleman to me without getting _something_ for yourself.\"\n\n\"Would you?\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I'm not crazy either,\" he said.\n\nLynch picked up a handful of papers. \"I've got all this work to do,\"\nhe said. \"So I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And if you need my help, buddy-boy,\" Lynch said, \"just yell. Right?\"\n\n\"I'll yell,\" Malone said. \"Don't worry about that. I'll yell loud\nenough to get myself heard in Space Station One.\"\n\n\n                                  9\n\nThe afternoon was bright and sunny, but it didn't match Malone's mood.\nHe got a cab outside the precinct station and headed for 69th Street,\ndining off his nails en route. When he hit the FBI headquarters, he\ncalled Washington and got Burris on the line.\n\nHe made a full report to the FBI chief, including his wild theory and\neverything else that had happened. \"And there was this notebook,\" he\nsaid, and reached into his jacket pocket for it.\n\nThe pocket was empty.\n\n\"What notebook?\" Burris said.\n\nMalone tried to remember if he'd left the book in his room. He\ncouldn't quite recall. \"This book I picked up,\" he said, and described\nit. \"I'll send it on, or bring it in when the case is over.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Burris said.\n\nMalone went on with his description of what had happened. When he'd\nfinished, Burris heaved a great sigh.\n\n\"My goodness,\" he said. \"Last year it was telepathic spies, and this\nyear it's teleporting thieves. Malone, I hate to think about next\nyear.\"\n\n\"I wish you hadn't said that,\" Malone said sadly.\n\nBurris blinked. \"Why?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, just because,\" Malone said. \"I haven't even had time to think\nabout next year yet. But I'll think about it now.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe it won't be so bad,\" Burris said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"No, Chief,\" he said. \"You're wrong. It'll be\nworse.\"\n\n\"This is bad enough,\" Burris said.\n\n\"It's a great vacation,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Please,\" Burris said. \"Did I have any idea--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris' eyes closed. \"All right, Malone,\" he said after a little\npause. \"Let's get back to the report. At least it explains the red\nCadillac business. Sergeant Jukovsky was hit by a boy who vanished.\nVanished. My God.\"\n\n\"I was hit by a boy who vanished, too,\" Malone said bitterly. \"But of\ncourse I'm just an FBI agent. Expendable. Nobody cares about--\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Malone,\" Burris said. \"You're one of my most valuable\nagents.\"\n\nMalone tried to stop himself from beaming, but he couldn't. \"Well,\nChief,\" he began, \"I--\"\n\n\"Vanishing boys,\" Burris muttered. \"What are you going to do with\nthem, Malone?\"\n\n\"I was hoping you might have some kind of suggestion,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I suppose I'll figure it out. When I catch them.\nBut I did want something from you, Chief.\"\n\n\"Anything, Malone,\" Burris said. \"Anything at all.\"\n\n\"I want you to get hold of Dr. O'Connor, out at Yucca Flats, if you\ncan. He's the best psionics man Westinghouse has right now, and I\nmight need him.\"\n\n\"If you say so,\" Burris said doubtfully.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"these kids are teleports. And maybe there's some\nway to stop a teleport. Give him a good hard kick in the psi, for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"In the what?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said savagely. \"But if I'm going to get any\ninformation on what makes teleports tick, I'm going to have to get it\nfrom Dr. O'Connor. Right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said.\n\n\"So get in touch with Dr. O'Connor,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll have him call you,\" Burris said. \"Meanwhile--well, meanwhile\njust carry on, Malone. I've got every confidence in you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone growled.\n\n\"If anybody can crack a case like this,\" Burris said, \"it's you.\"\n\n\"I suppose it had better be,\" Malone said, and rang off.\n\nThen he started to think. The notebook wasn't in his pockets. He\nchecked every one, even the jacket pocket where he usually kept a\nhandkerchief and nothing else. It wasn't anywhere on his person.\n\nHad he left it in his room?\n\nHe thought about that for several minutes, and finally decided that he\nhadn't. He hadn't taken it out of his pocket, for one thing, and if it\nhad fallen to the ground he couldn't have helped seeing it. Of course\nhe'd put his wallet, keys, change, and other such items on the\ndresser, and then replaced them in his pockets in the morning. But he\ncould remember how they'd looked on the dresser.\n\nThe notebook hadn't been there among them.\n\nNow that he came to think of it, when had he seen the notebook last?\nHe'd shown it to Lieutenant Lynch during the afternoon, and then he'd\nput it back in his pocket, and he hadn't looked for it again.\n\nSo it had to be somewhere in one of the bars he'd visited, or at the\ntheater where he and Dorothy had seen _The Hot Seat_.\n\nProud of himself for this careful and complete job of deduction, he\nstrolled out and, giving Boyd and the Agent-in-Charge one small smile\neach, to remember him by, he went into the sunlight, trying to decide\nwhich place to check first.\n\nHe settled on the theater because it was most probable. After all,\npeople were always losing things in theaters. Besides, if he started\nat the theater, and found the notebook there, he could then go on to a\nbar to celebrate. If he found the notebook in a bar, he didn't much\nrelish the idea of going on to an empty theater in the middle of the\nafternoon to celebrate.\n\nShaking his head over this flimsy structure of logic, he headed down\nto _The Hot Seat_. He banged on the lobby doors for a while without\nany good result, and finally leaned against one of the side doors,\nwhich opened. Malone fell through, recovered his balance, and found\nhimself facing an old bewhiskered man with a dustpan, a broom, and a\nsurprised expression.\n\n\"I'm looking for a notebook,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Try a stationery store, youngster,\" the old man said. \"I thought I'd\nheard 'em all, but--\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"You don't understand.\"\n\n\"I don't got to understand,\" the old man said. \"That's what's so\nrestful about this here job. I just got to sweep up. I don't got to\nunderstand nothing. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a notebook I lost here last night,\" Malone said\ndesperately.\n\n\"Oh,\" the old man said. \"Lost and Found. That's different. You come\nwith me.\"\n\nThe old man led Malone in silence to a cave deep in the bowels of the\ntheater, where he went behind a little desk, took up a pencil as if it\nwere a club, held it poised over a sheet of grimy paper, and said,\n\"Name?\"\n\nMalone said, \"I just want to find a notebook.\"\n\n\"Got to give me your name, youngster,\" the old man said solemnly.\n\"It's the rules here.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"Kenneth Malone,\" he said. \"And my address is--\"\n\nThe old man, fiercely scribbling, looked up. \"Wait a minute, can't\nyou?\" he said. \"I ain't through 'Kenneth' yet.\" He wrote on, and\nfinally said, \"Address?\"\n\n\"Hotel New Yorker,\" Malone said. \"In Manhattan?\" the old man said.\n\"That's right,\" Malone said wearily.\n\n\"Ah,\" the old man said. \"Tourist, ain't you? Tourists is always losing\nthings. Once it was a big dog. Don't know yet how a dog got into this\nhere theater. Had to feed it for four days before somebody showed up\nto claim it. Fierce-looking animal. Part bloodhound, part water\nspaniel.\"\n\nFascinated in spite of himself, Malone said, \"That's impossible.\"\n\n\"Nothing's impossible,\" the old man said. \"Work for a theater long\nenough and you find that out. Part bloodhound, I said, and part water\nspaniel. Should have seen that dog before you start talking about\nimpossibilities. Hell of a strange-looking beast. And then there was\nthe time--\"\n\n\"About the notebook,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Notebook?\" the old man said.\n\n\"I lost a notebook,\" Malone said. \"I was hoping that--\"\n\n\"Description?\" the old man said, and poised his pencil again.\n\nMalone heaved a great sigh. \"Black plastic,\" he said. \"About so big.\"\nHe made motions with his hands. \"No names or initials on it. But the\nfirst page had my name written on it, along with Lieutenant Peter\nLynch.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" the old man said.\n\n\"He's a cop,\" Malone said.\n\n\"My, my,\" the old man said. \"Valuable notebook, with a cop's name in\nit and all. You a cop, youngster?\"\n\nMalone shook his head.\n\n\"Too bad,\" the old man said obscurely. \"I like cops.\" He stood up.\n\"You said black plastic? Black?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"Do you have it here?\"\n\n\"Got no notebooks at all here, youngster,\" the old man said. \"Empty\nbillfold, three hats, a couple of coats, and some pencils. And an\numbrella. No dogs tonight, youngster, _and_ no notebooks.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Well--wait a minute.\"\n\n\"What is it, youngster?\" the old man said. \"I'm busy this time of day.\nGot to sweep and clean. Got work to do. Not like you tourists.\"\n\nWith difficulty, Malone leashed his temper. \"Why did I have to\ndescribe the notebook?\" he said. \"You haven't got any notebooks at\nall.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the old man said cheerfully.\n\n\"But you made me describe--\"\n\n\"That's the rules,\" the old man said. \"And I ain't about to go against\nthe rules. Not for no tourist.\" He put the pencil down and rose. \"Wish\nyou were a cop,\" he said. \"I never met a cop. They don't lose things\nlike people do.\"\n\nMaking a mental note to call up later and talk to the manager, if the\nnotebook hadn't turned up in the meantime, Malone went off to find the\nbars he had stopped in before the theater.\n\nSaving Topp's for last, he started at the Ad Lib, where a surprised\nbald-headed man told him they hadn't found a notebook anywhere in the\nbar for something like six weeks. \"Now if you'd been looking for\numbrellas,\" he said, \"we could have accommodated you. Got over ten\numbrellas downstairs, waiting for their owners. I wonder why people\nlose so many umbrellas?\"\n\n\"Maybe they hate rain,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the bald man said. \"I'm sort of a psychologist--you\nknow, a judge of people. I think it's an unconscious protest against\nthe fetters of a society which is slowly strangling them by--\"\n\nMalone said good-bye in a hurry and left. His next stop was the\nXochitl, the Mexican bar on 46th Street. He greeted the bartender\nwarmly.\n\n\"Ah,\" the bartender told him. \"You come back. We look for you.\"\n\n\"Look for me?\" Malone said. \"You mean you found my notebook?\"\n\n\"Notesbook?\" the bartender said.\n\n\"A little black plastic book,\" Malone said, making motions, \"about so\nbig. And it--\"\n\n\"Not find,\" the bartender said. \"You lose him?\"\n\n\"Sure I lost him,\" Malone said. \"I mean _it_. Would I be looking for\nit if I hadn't lost it?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" the bartender said, and shrugged.\n\n\"But you said you were looking for me,\" Malone said. \"What about?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the bartender said. \"I only say that. Make customer feel good,\nthink we miss him. Customers like, so we do. What your name?\"\n\n\"Pizarro,\" Malone said disgustedly, and went away.\n\nThe last stop was Topp's. Well, he had to find the notebook there. It\nwas the only place the notebook could be. That was logic, and Malone\nwas proud of it. He walked into Topp's, trying to remember the\nbartender's name, and found it just as he walked into the bar.\n\n\"Hello, Wally,\" he said gaily.\n\nThe bartender stared at him. \"I'm not Wally,\" he said. \"Wally's the\nnight barman. My name's Ray.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, feeling deflated. \"Well, I've come about a\nnotebook.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Ray said.\n\n\"I lost the notebook here yesterday evening, between six and eight. If\nyou'll just take me to the Lost and Found--\"\n\n\"One moment, sir,\" Ray said, and left him standing at the bar, all\nalone.\n\nIn a few seconds he was back. \"I didn't see the notebook myself, sir,\"\nhe said. \"But if Wally picked it up, he'd have turned it over to the\nma\u00eetre d'. Perhaps you'd like to check with him.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. The daytime ma\u00eetre d' turned out to be a\nshortish, heavy-set man with large blue eyes, a silver mane, and a\nthin, pencil-line mustache. He was addressed, for no reason Malone was\nable to discover, as BeeBee.\n\nRay introduced them. \"This gentleman wants to know about a notebook,\"\nhe told BeeBee.\n\n\"Notebook?\" BeeBee said.\n\nMalone explained at length. BeeBee nodded in an understanding fashion\nfor some moments and, when Malone had finished, disappeared in search\nof the Lost and Found. He came back rather quickly, with the\ndisturbing news that no notebook was anywhere in the place.\n\n\"It's got to be here,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" BeeBee said, \"it isn't. Maybe you left it some place else.\nMaybe it's home now.\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" Malone said. \"And I've tried every place else.\"\n\n\"New York's a big city, Mr. Malone,\" BeeBee said.\n\nMalone sighed. \"I've tried every place I've been. The notebook\ncouldn't be somewhere I haven't been. A rolling stone follows its\nowner.\" He thought about that. It didn't seem to mean anything, but\nmaybe it had. There was no way to tell for sure.\n\nHe went back to the bar to think things over and figure out his next\nmove. A bourbon and soda while thinking seemed the obvious order, and\nRay bustled off to get it.\n\nHad he left the notebook on the street somewhere, just dropping it by\naccident? Malone couldn't quite see that happening. It was, of course,\npossible; but the possibility was so remote that he decided to try and\nthink of everything else first. There was Dorothy, for instance.\n\nHad he got stewed enough so that he'd showed Dorothy the notebook?\n\nHe didn't remember doing it, and he didn't quite see why he would\nhave. Most of the evening was more or less clear in his mind; he\nhadn't apparently, forgotten any other details, either.\n\nAll the same, it was an idea. He decided to give the girl a call and\nfind out for sure. Maybe she remembered something that would help him,\nanyway.\n\nHe took the drink from Ray and slid off the bar stool. Two steps away,\nhe remembered one more little fact.\n\nHe didn't have her number, and he didn't know anything about where she\nlived, except that it could be reached by subway. That, Malone told\nhimself morosely, limited things nicely to the five boroughs of New\nYork.\n\nAnd she said she was living with her aunt. Would she have a phone\nlisting under her own name? Or would the listing be under her aunt's\nname, which he also didn't know?\n\nAt any rate, he could check listings under Dorothy Francis, he told\nhimself.\n\nHe did so.\n\nThere were lots and lots of people named Dorothy Francis, in Manhattan\nand in all the other boroughs.\n\nMalone went back to the bar to think some more. He was on his second\nbourbon and soda, still thinking but without any new ideas, when\nBeeBee tapped him gently on the shoulder.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" the ma\u00eetre d' said, \"but are you English?\"\n\n\"Am I what?\" Malone said, spilling a little of his drink on the bar.\n\n\"Are you English?\" BeeBee said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"No. Irish. Very Irish.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" BeeBee said.\n\nMalone stared at him. \"I think it's fine,\" he said, \"but I'd love to\nknow why you asked me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" BeeBee said, \"I knew you couldn't be American. Not after the\nphone call. You don't have to hide your nationality here; we're quite\naccustomed to foreign visitors. And we don't have special prices for\ntourists.\"\n\nMalone waited two breaths. \"Will you please tell me,\" he said slowly,\n\"what it is you're talking about?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" BeeBee said with aplomb. \"There's a call for you in the\nupstairs booth. A long-distance call, personal.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Who'd know I was--\" He stopped, thinking hard.\nThere was no way for anybody in the world to know he was in Topp's.\nTherefore, nobody could be calling him. \"They've got the wrong name,\"\nhe said decisively.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" BeeBee said. \"I heard them quite distinctly. You _are_ Sir\nKenneth Malone, aren't you?\"\n\nMalone gaped for one long second, and then his mind caught up with the\nfacts. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Sure.\" He raced upstairs to the phone booth,\nsaid, \"This is Sir Kenneth Malone,\" into the blank screen, and waited.\n\nAfter a while an operator said, \"Person-to-person call, Sir Kenneth,\nfrom Yucca Flats. Will you take this call?\"\n\n\"I'll take it,\" Malone said. A face appeared on the screen, and Malone\nknew he was right. He knew exactly how he'd been located, and by whom.\n\nLooking only at the face in the screen, it might have been thought\nthat the woman who appeared there was somebody's grandmother, kindly,\nred-cheeked, and twinkle-eyed. Perhaps that wasn't the only\nstereotype; she could have been an old-maid schoolteacher, one of the\nkindly schoolteachers who taught, once upon a time that never was, in\nthe little red schoolhouses of the dim past. The face positively\nradiated kindliness, and friendship, and peace.\n\nBut if the face was the face of a sentimental dream, the garb was the\ngarb of royalty. Somebody's grandmother was on her way to a costume\nparty. She wore the full court costume of the days of Queen Elizabeth\nI, complete with brocaded velvet gown, wide ruff collar, and bejeweled\nskullcap.\n\nShe was, Malone knew, completely insane.\n\nLike all the other telepaths Malone and the rest of the FBI had found\nduring their work in uncovering a telepathic spy, she had been located\nin an insane asylum. Months of extensive psychotherapy, including all\nthe newest techniques and some so old that psychiatrists were a little\nafraid to use them, had done absolutely nothing to shake the firm\nconviction in the mind of Miss Rose Thompson.\n\nShe was, she insisted, Elizabeth Tudor, rightful Queen of England.\n\nShe claimed she was immortal, which was not true. She also claimed to\nbe a telepath. This was perfectly accurate. It had been her help that\nhad enabled Malone to find the telepathic spy, and a grateful\ngovernment had rewarded her.\n\nIt had given her a special expense allotment for life, covering the\nclothing she wore, and the style in which she lived. Rooms had been\nset aside for her at Yucca Flats, and she held court there, sometimes\nbeing treated by psychiatrists and sometimes helping Dr. Thomas\nO'Connor in his experiments and in the development of new psionic\nmachines.\n\nShe was probably the happiest psychopath on Earth.\n\nMalone stared at her. For a second he could think of nothing to say\nbut, \"My God.\" He said it.\n\n\"Not at all, Sir Kenneth,\" the little old lady said. \"Your Queen.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"Good afternoon, Your Majesty,\" he said.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Sir Kenneth,\" she said, and waited. After a second\nMalone figured out what she was waiting for.\n\nHe inclined his head in as courtly a bow as he could manage over a\nvisiphone. \"I am deeply honored,\" he said, \"that Your Majesty has\ncalled on me. Is there any way in which I might be of service?\"\n\n\"Oh, goodness me, no,\" said the little old lady. \"I don't need a\nthing. They do one very well here in Yucca Flats. You must come out\nsoon and see my new throne room. I've had the decorations done by--but\nI can see you're not interested in that, Sir Kenneth.\"\n\n\"But--\" Malone realized it was useless to argue with the old lady. She\nwas telepathic, and knew exactly what he was thinking. That, after\nall, was how he had been located; she had mentally \"hunted\" for him\nuntil she found him.\n\nBut why?\n\n\"I'll tell you why, Sir Kenneth,\" the little old lady said. \"I'm\nworried about you.\"\n\n\"Worried? About me, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the little old lady said, inclining her head just the\nproper number of degrees, and raising it again. \"You, Sir Kenneth, and\nthat silly little notebook you lost. You've been stewing about it for\nthe last hour.\"\n\nIt was obvious that, for reasons of her own, the Queen had seen fit to\nlook into Malone's mind. She'd found him worrying, and called him\nabout it. It was, Malone thought, sweet of her in a way. But it was\nalso just a bit disconcerting.\n\nHe was perfectly well aware that the Queen could read his mind at any\ndistance. But unless something reminded him of the fact, he didn't\nhave to think about it.\n\nAnd he didn't like to think about it.\n\n\"Don't be disturbed,\" the Queen said. \"Please. I only want to help\nyou, Sir Kenneth; you know that.\"\n\n\"Well, of course I do,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Heavens to Betsy,\" she said. \"Sir Kenneth, what kind of a detective\nare you?\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said, and added at once, \"Your Majesty.\" He knew\nperfectly well, of course, that Miss Thompson was not Queen Elizabeth\nI--and he knew that Miss Thompson knew what he thought.\n\nBut she didn't mind. Politeness, she held, was the act of being\npleasant on the surface, no matter what a person really thought.\nPeople were polite to their bosses, she pointed out, even though they\nwere perfectly sure that they could do a better job than the bosses\nwere doing.\n\nSo she insisted on the surface pretense that Malone was going through,\ntreating her like a Queen.\n\nThe psychiatrists had called her delusion a beautifully rationalized\none. As far as Malone was concerned, it made more sense than most of\nreal life.\n\n\"That's very nice of you, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"But I ask you\nagain, what kind of detective are you? Haven't you got any common\nsense at all?\"\n\nMalone hated to admit it, but he had always had just that suspicion.\nAfter all, he wasn't a very good detective. He was just lucky. His\nluck had enabled him to break a lot of tough cases. But some day\npeople would find out, and then--\n\n\"Well,\" the Queen said, \"at the very least you ought to _act_ like a\ndetective.\" She sniffed audibly. \"Sir Kenneth, I'm ashamed that a\nmember of my own FBI can't do any better than you're doing now.\"\n\nMalone blinked into the screen. He did feel ashamed in a vague sort of\nway, and he was willing to admit it. But he did feel, wistfully, that\nit would be nice to know just what he was being ashamed of. \"Have I\nbeen missing something?\" he said.\n\n\"Outside of the obvious,\" the Queen said, \"that you've been missing\nyour notebook--or rather Mike Fueyo's notebook--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You certainly have,\" the Queen said. \"Don't you see what happened to\nthat notebook? You've been missing the only possible explanation.\"\n\n\"But there isn't any,\" Malone said. \"Unless Miss Francis has it.\"\n\nHer Majesty gave him a bright smile. \"There!\" she said.\n\n\"There, what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I knew you could do it,\" the Queen said. \"All you had to do was apply\nyour intelligence, and you'd come up with just the fact you needed.\"\n\n\"What fact?\" Malone said.\n\n\"That Miss Francis has your notebook,\" the Queen said. \"You just told\nme.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said, and stopped and took a deep breath. \"My\nGod,\" he said after a pause. \"What is that supposed to mean? Did I\ngive it to her after all?\"\n\n\"No,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"Did I lose it, and did she pick it up?\"\n\n\"No,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"My God,\" Malone said again. \"All right. I give up. Is this Twenty\nQuestions?\"\n\n\"Sir Kenneth!\" the Queen said. \"What a way to talk to your Queen!\"\n\nMalone took another breath. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered. \"But--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" the Queen said sympathetically. \"You're upset. But you\ndidn't give Miss Francis the notebook, and she didn't find it after\nyou'd lost it.\"\n\n\"Then--\" Malone stared. \"She stole it. She stole it from me.\"\n\n\"I imagine she took it right from your jacket pocket,\" the Queen said.\n\"Now, if you'd only wear proper clothing, and a proper pouch at your\nbelt--\"\n\n\"I'd be stared at,\" Malone said. \"In court clothing.\"\n\n\"No one in New York would stare at you,\" the Queen said. \"They'd think\nit was what they call an advertising stunt.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Malone said, \"I wasn't wearing court clothing. So that made\nit easy for her to steal the notebook. But why, for God's sake? Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" the Queen said, \"she needed it.\"\n\n_\"Needed it?\"_ Malone shrieked.\n\n\"Please, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"Don't talk to your Sovereign\nin that manner. And I do wish you'd stop thinking of that girl as\nDorothy Francis. She isn't at all, you know.\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"I don't know. If she isn't Dorothy Francis, who in\nhell is she?\"\n\n\"Don't swear, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"She's Dorothea Francisca\nFueyo, if you want to know.\"\n\nMalone gulped. \"Then she's--\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the Queen said. \"She's little Miguel Fueyo's older\nsister.\"\n\n\n                                  10\n\nMalone put in a great deal of time, he imagined, just staring at the\nface of the little old lady on the screen. At last he spoke. \"My God,\"\nhe said. \"Her name is Fueyo. I'll be damned.\"\n\n\"I've told you,\" the Queen said with some asperity, \"not to swear, Sir\nKenneth.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"You're excited,\" the Queen said. \"You're stunned. Goodness, you don't\nneed to tell me that, Sir Kenneth. I know.\"\n\n\"But she's--\" Malone discovered that he couldn't talk. He swallowed a\ncouple of times and then went on. \"She's Mike Fueyo's sister.\"\n\n\"That's exactly right, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"That's just what\nI told you.\"\n\n\"Then she swiped the book to protect her little brother,\" Malone said.\n\"Oh, boy.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"And she doesn't care about me at all,\" Malone said. \"I mean, she only\nwent out with me because I was me. Malone. And she wanted the\nnotebook. That was all there was to it.\" He added an expletive. The\nQueen frowned, but said nothing about it.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that if I were you,\" she went on. \"Quite the contrary.\nShe does like you, you know. And she thinks you're a very nice\nperson.\" The Queen beamed. \"You are, you know,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said uncomfortably. \"Sure.\"\n\n\"You don't have to think that she merely went out with you because of\nher brother's notebook,\" the Queen said. \"But she does have a strong\nsense of loyalty--and he is--her younger brother, after all.\"\n\n\"He sure is,\" Malone said. \"He's a great kid, little Mike.\"\n\n\"You see,\" the Queen continued imperturbably, \"Mike told her about\nlosing the notebook the other night--when he struck you.\"\n\n\"When he struck me,\" Malone said. \"Oh, yes. He struck me, all right.\"\n\n\"He guessed that you must have it when you started asking questions\nabout the Silent Spooks, you see,\" the Queen said. \"That was the only\nway you could have found out about him--unless you were telepathic.\nWhich, of course, you're not.\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Now, understand me,\" the Queen said. \"I do not think that his\nstriking you was a very nice act.\"\n\n\"I don't either,\" Malone said. \"It hurt like--it hurt quite a lot.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Queen said. \"But he didn't hurt the car any, and he\ndidn't want to. He just wanted to ride around in it for a while.\"\n\n\"He likes red Cadillacs,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the Queen said. \"He thinks they're wonderful.\"\n\n\"Good for him,\" Malone said sourly.\n\n\"Well, now,\" the Queen said. \"You just go right on over to her house.\nOf course she doesn't live with an aunt.\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"She lives with Mike and his mother.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the Queen said. \"She's part of the family.\"\n\nMalone nodded silently.\n\n\"She'll give you the book, Sir Kenneth. I just know that she will. And\nI want you to be very nice to her when you ask for it. She's a very\nnice girl, you know.\"\n\n\"She's a swell girl,\" Malone said morosely. \"And I'll--hey. Wait a\nminute.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Kenneth?\"\n\n\"How come you can read her thoughts?\" Malone said. \"And Mike's? I\nthought you had to know somebody pretty well before you could read\nthem at a distance like this. Do you? Know them, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" the Queen said. \"But I can read _you_, of course.\" Malone\ncould see that the Queen was trying very hard not to look proud of\nherself. \"And last night,\" she went on, \"you two were--well, Sir\nKenneth, you had a real _rapport_ with each other. My goodness, yes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"we--\"\n\n\"Don't explain, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"It really isn't\nnecessary; I thought it was very sweet. And, in any case, I can pick\nher up now. Because of that rapport. Not quite as well as I can pick\nyou up, but enough to get the strong surface thoughts.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"But Mike--\"\n\n\"I can't pick him up at all, this far away,\" the Queen said. \"There is\njust a faint touch of him, though, through the girl. But all I know\nabout him is what she thinks.\" She smiled gently. \"He's a nice boy,\nbasically,\" she said.\n\n\"Sure he is,\" Malone said. \"He's got a nice blackjack,\ntoo--basically.\" He grimaced. \"Were you reading my mind all last\nnight?\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" the Queen said, \"no. Toward morning you were getting so fuzzy\nI just didn't bother.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Malone said. \"I nearly didn't bother myself.\"\n\nThe queen nodded. \"But toward afternoon,\" she said, \"I didn't have\nanything to do, so I just listened in. You do have such a nice mind,\nSir Kenneth. So refreshing and different. Especially when you're in\nlove.\"\n\nMalone blushed quietly.\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" the Queen said. \"You'd much rather think of yourself as\na sort of apprentice lecher, a kind of cynical Don Juan, but--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"Don't tell me about it. All right?\"\n\n\"Of course, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said, \"if you wish it.\"\n\n\"Basically, I'm a nice boy,\" Malone said. \"Sure I am.\" He paused. \"Do\nyou have any more pertinent information, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Not right now,\" the Queen admitted. \"But if I do, I'll let you know.\"\nShe giggled. \"You know, I had to argue awfully hard with Dr. Hatterer\nto get to use the telephone,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll bet,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But I did manage,\" she said, and winked. \"I won't have that sort of\ntrouble again.\"\n\nMalone wondered briefly what dark secret Dr. Hatterer had, that Her\nMajesty had discovered in his mind and used to blackmail him with. At\nlast he decided that it was probably none of his business, and didn't\nmatter too much anyway.\n\n\"Quite right, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"And good bye for now.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Your Majesty,\" Malone said. He bowed again, and flipped off\nthe phone. Bowing in a phone booth wasn't the easiest thing in the\nworld to do, he thought to himself. But somehow he had managed it.\n\nHe reached into his pocket, half-convinced for a moment that it was an\nElizabethan belt-pouch. Talks with Her Majesty always had that effect;\nafter a time, Malone came to believe in the strange, bright world. But\nhe shook off the lingering effects of her psychosis, fished out some\ncoins and thought for a minute.\n\nSo Dorothy--Dorothea--had lifted the notebook. That was some help,\ncertainly. It let him know something more about the enemy he was\nfacing. But it wasn't really a lot of help.\n\nWhat did he do now?\n\nHer Majesty had suggested going to the Fueyo house, collaring the girl\n(but treating her nicely, Malone reminded himself) and demanding the\nbook back. She'd even said he would get the book back, and since she\nknew some of what went on in Dorothea Fueyo's mind, she was probably\nright.\n\nBut what good was that going to do him?\n\nHe knew everything that was in the book. Getting it back was something\nthat could wait. It didn't sound particularly profitable, and it\ndidn't even sound like fun.\n\nWhat he needed was a next move. He thought for a minute, dropped the\ncoins into the phone and dialed the number of the Police\nCommissioner's office. After a brief argument with a secretary, he had\nFernack on the phone. And this time, Malone told himself, he was going\nto be polite.\n\nIf possible.\n\n\"Good afternoon, John Henry,\" he said sunnily, when the commissioner's\nface was finally on the screen. \"Can you get me some more\ninformation?\"\n\nFernack stared at him sourly. \"Depends,\" he said.\n\n\"On what?\" Malone said, telling himself he wasn't going to get\nirritated, and knowing perfectly well that he was lying.\n\n\"On what kind of information you want,\" Fernack said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"there's a warehouse I want to know some more\nabout. Who the owner is, for one thing, and--\"\n\nFernack nodded. \"I've got it,\" he said. He fished around on his desk,\nand brought up a sheet of paper. He held it up to the screen while\nMalone copied off the name and address. \"Lieutenant Lynch told me all\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Lynch?\" Malone said. \"But he--\"\n\n\"Lynch works for me, Malone,\" Fernack said. \"Remember that.\"\n\n\"But he said he'd--\"\n\n\"He said he wouldn't do anything, and he won't,\" Fernack said. \"He\njust reported it to me for my action. He knew I was working with you,\nMalone. And I am his boss, remember.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. \"Now, John Henry--\"\n\n\"Hold it, Malone,\" Fernack said. \"I'd like a little information too,\nyou know. I'd like to know just what the hell is going on, if it isn't\ntoo much trouble.\"\n\n\"It's not that, John Henry,\" Malone said earnestly. \"Really. It's just\nthat I--\"\n\n\"All this about vanishing boys,\" Fernack said. \"Disappearing into thin\nair. All this nonsense.\"\n\n\"It isn't nonsense,\" Malone said.\n\n\"All right,\" Fernack said indulgently. \"Boys disappear every day like\nthat. Sure they do.\" He leaned toward the screen and his voice was as\nhard as his face. \"Malone, are these kids mixed up with those\nimpossible robberies you had me looking up?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I think so. But I doubt if you could prove it.\"\n\nFernack's face had begun its slow climb toward purple again. \"Malone,\"\nhe said, \"if you're suppressing evidence, even if you are the FBI,\nI'll--\"\n\n\"I'm not suppressing any evidence,\" Malone said. \"I don't think _you_\ncould prove a connection. I don't think _I_ could prove a connection.\nI don't think _anybody_ could--not right now.\"\n\nFernack leaned back, apparently mollified.\n\n\"John Henry,\" Malone said, \"I want to ask you to keep your hands off\nthis case. To let me handle it my way.\"\n\nFernack nodded absently. \"Sure, Malone,\" he said.\n\n_\"What?\"_\n\n\"I said sure,\" Fernack said. \"Isn't that what you wanted?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" Malone said, \"but--\"\n\nFernack leaned all the way back in his chair, his face a mask of\ndisappointment and frustration. \"Malone,\" he said, \"I wish I'd never\nheard of this case. I wish I'd been retired or died before it ever\ncame up. I've been a police officer in New York for a long time, and I\nwish this case had waited a few more years to happen.\"\n\nHe stopped. Malone leaned against the back wall of the phone booth and\nlit a cigarette.\n\n\"Andy Burris called me less than half an hour ago,\" Fernack said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Fernack said. \"Good old Burris of the FBI. And he told\nme this was a National Security case. National Security! It's your\nbaby, Malone, because Burris wants it that way.\" He snorted. \"So don't\nworry about me,\" he said. \"I'm just here to co-operate. The patriotic,\nloyal, dumb slave of a grateful government.\"\n\nMalone blew out a plume of smoke. \"You know, John Henry,\" he said,\n\"you might have made a good FBI man yourself. You've got the right\nattitude.\"\n\n\"Never mind the jokes,\" Fernack said bitterly.\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"But tell me, did you actually make arrangements\nfor me to get into that warehouse? I suppose you know that's what I\nwant.\"\n\n\"I guessed that much,\" Fernack said. \"I haven't made any arrangements\nat all yet, but I will. I'll have Safe and Loft get the keys, and a\nfull set of floor plans to the place while they're at it. Will that\ndo, Your Majesty?\"\n\nMalone choked on his smoke and shot a quick look over his shoulder.\nThere was nothing there but the wall of the booth. Queen Elizabeth I\nwas nowhere in evidence. Then he realized that Fernack had been\ntalking to him.\n\n\"Don't _do_ that,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" Fernack said.\n\nMalone realized in one awful second how strange the explanation was\ngoing to sound. Could he say that he thought he'd been mistaken for an\nold friend of his, Elizabeth Tudor? Could he say that he'd just had a\ncall from her?\n\nIn the end he merely said, \"Nothing,\" and let it go at that.\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" Fernack said, \"do you want anything else?\"\n\n\"Not right now,\" Malone said. \"I'll let you know, though And thanks,\nJohn Henry. No matter why you're doing this, thanks.\"\n\n\"I don't deserve 'em,\" Fernack muttered. \"And I hope you get caught in\nsome kind of deadfall and have to come screaming to the cops.\"\n\nThat, Malone reflected, was the second time a cop had suggested his\nyelling if he got into trouble. Hadn't the police force ever heard of\ntelephones?\n\nHe said good-bye and flipped off.\n\nThen he stared at the screen for a little while, as his cigarette\nburned down between his fingers. At last he put the cigarette out and\nwent downstairs again to the bar.\n\nIf he had to do some heavy thinking, he told himself, there was\nabsolutely no reason why he couldn't enjoy himself a little while\ndoing it.\n\nThe evening rush had begun, and Malone found himself a stool simply by\nslipping into one while a drinker's back was turned. Once ensconced,\nhe huddled himself up like an old drunk, thus effectively cutting\nhimself off from interruptions, and lit another cigarette. Ray was\ndown at the other end of the bar, chatting with a red-headed woman and\nher pale, bald escort. Malone sighed and set himself to the job of\nserious, constructive thinking.\n\n_How,_ he asked himself, _do you go about catching a person who can\nvanish away like so much smoke?_\n\nWell, Malone could think of one solution, but it was pretty bloody.\n\nNailing the kids to a wall would probably work, but he couldn't say\nmuch else for it. There had to be another way out. For some reason,\nMalone just couldn't see himself with a mouthful of nails, a hammer,\nand a teen-ager.\n\nIt sounded just a little too messy.\n\nThen, of course, there were handcuffs.\n\nThat sounded a little better. The trouble was that Malone simply\ndidn't have enough information, and knew it. Obviously, the kids could\ncarry stuff with them when they teleported; the stuff they stole\nproved that. And their clothes, Malone added. Apparently the kids\ndidn't arrive at wherever they went stark staring naked.\n\nBut how close to a teleport did the things he carried have to be?\n\nIn other words, Malone thought, if you put handcuffs on a teleport,\nwould the handcuffs vanish when the teleport did? And did that include\nthe part of the cuff you were holding?\n\nWhat happened if you snapped half the cuff around your own wrist\nfirst? Did you go along with the teleport? Or did your wrist go, while\nyou stayed behind and wondered how long it would take to bleed to\ndeath?\n\nOr what?\n\nAll the questions were intriguing ones. Malone sighed, wishing he knew\nthe answer to even one of them.\n\nIt was somewhat comforting to think that he'd managed to progress a\nlittle, anyway. The kids hadn't meant anybody to find out about them;\nbut Malone had found out about them, and alerted all the cops in town,\nas well as the rest of the FBI. He knew just who they were, and where\nthey lived, and how they performed the \"miracles\" they performed.\n\nAnyhow, he knew something about that last item.\n\nHe even knew who had his notebook.\n\nHe tabled that thought, and went back to feeling victorious. Within a\nfew seconds, the sense of achievement was gone, and futility had come\nin its place. After all, he still didn't know how to catch the kids,\ndid he?\n\nNo.\n\nHe thought about handcuffs some more and then gave up. He'd just have\nto try it and see how it worked. And if the teleports took his wrist\naway he'd--he'd go after them and make them give it back.\n\nSure he would.\n\nThat reminded him of the notebook again, and since the thing was being\nso persistent, he decided he might as well pay some attention to it.\n\nDorothea had the notebook. Malone tried to see himself barging in on\nher and asking for it, and he didn't care for the picture at all--no\nmatter how Good Queen Bess felt about it.\n\nAfter all, she thought Mike Fueyo was basically a nice kid.\n\nSo what did she know?\n\nHe closed his eyes. There he was, in the Fueyo apartment, talking to\nDorothea.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" he muttered. \"You filched my notebook.\"\n\nThat didn't sound very effective. And besides, it wasn't really his\nnotebook. He tried again.\n\n\"Dorothea, you pinched your brother's notebook.\"\n\nNow, for some reason, it sounded like something covered by the Vice\nSquad. It sounded terrible. But there were other ways of saying the\nsame thing.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" he muttered, \"you borrowed your brother's notebook.\"\n\nThat was too patronizing. Malone told himself that he sounded like a\ncharacter straight out of 3-D screens, and settled himself gamely for\nanother try.\n\n\"Dorothea, you _have_ your brother's notebook.\"\n\nTo which the obvious answer was, \"Yes, I do, and so what?\"\n\nOr possibly, \"How do you know?\"\n\nAnd Malone thought about answering that one. \"Queen Elizabeth told\nme,\" was the literal truth, but somehow it didn't sound like it. And\nhe couldn't find another answer to give the girl.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" he said, and a voice from nowhere added:\n\n\"Will you have another drink?\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" Malone exploded, \"that's not the question. Drinks have\nnothing to do with notebooks. It's notebooks I'm after. Can't you\nunderstand...\" Belatedly, he looked up.\n\nThere was Ray, the barman. \"Oh,\" he said.\n\n\"I just came over,\" Ray said. \"And I figured if you couldn't find your\nnotebook, maybe you'd like a drink. So long as you're here.\"\n\n\"Ray,\" Malone said with feeling, \"you are an eminently reasonable\nfellow. I accept your solution. Nay, more. I endorse your solution.\nWholeheartedly.\"\n\nRay went off to mix, and Malone stared after him happily. This was\nreally a nice place, he reflected; almost as nice as the City Hall Bar\nin Chicago, where he'd gone long ago with his father.\n\nBut he tore his mind away from the happy past, and concentrated\ninstead on the miserable present. He decided for the last time that he\nwas not going to ask Dorothea for the book--not just yet, anyhow.\nAfter all, it wasn't as if he needed the book; he knew his own name,\nand he knew Lynch's name, and he knew the names on the second page.\nAnd he didn't see any particular need for a picture of a red Cadillac,\nno matter how nicely colored it was.\n\nSo, he asked himself, why embarrass everybody by trying to get it\nback?\n\nOf course, it _was_ technically a crime to pick pockets, and that went\ndouble or triple for the pockets of FBI agents. But Malone told\nhimself that he didn't feel like pressing charges, anyhow. And Dorothy\nprobably didn't make a habit of pocket-picking.\n\nHe sighed and glanced at his watch. It was fifteen minutes of six.\n\nNow he knew what his next move was going to be.\n\nHe was going to go back to his hotel and change his clothes.\n\nThat is, he amended, as soon as he finished the drink that Ray was\nsetting up in front of him.\n\n\n                                  11\n\nBy the time Malone reached the Hotel New Yorker it was six-twenty.\nMalone hadn't reckoned with New York's rush-hour traffic, and, after\nseeing it, he still didn't believe it. Finding a cab had been\nimpossible, and he had started for the subway, hoping that he wouldn't\nget lost and end up somewhere in Brooklyn.\n\nBut one look at the shrieking mob trying to sardine itself into the\nSeventh Avenue subway entrance had convinced him it was better to\nwalk. Bucking the street crowds was bad enough. Bucking the subway\ncrowds was something Malone didn't even want to think about.\n\nHe let himself into his room, and was taking off his shoes with a\ngrateful sigh when there was a rap on the door of the bathroom that\nconnected his room with Boyd's. Malone padded over to the door, his\nshoes in one hand. \"Tom?\" he said.\n\n\"You are expecting maybe Titus Moody?\" Boyd called.\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"Come on in.\"\n\nBoyd pushed open the door. He was stripped to the waist, a state of\ndress which showed the largest expanse of chest Malone had ever seen,\nand he was carrying the small scissors which he used to trim his Henry\nVIII beard. He stabbed the scissors toward Malone, who shuffled back\nhurriedly.\n\n\"Listen,\" Boyd said. \"Did you call the office after you left this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone admitted. \"Why? What happened?\"\n\n\"There was a call for you,\" Boyd said. \"Long distance, just before I\nleft at five. I came on back to the hotel and waited until I heard you\ncome in. Thought you might want to know about it.\"\n\n\"I do, I guess,\" Malone said. \"Who from?\" Looking at Boyd, a\nmodern-day Henry VIII, the association was too obvious to be missed.\nMalone thought of Good Queen Bess, and wondered why she was calling\nhim again.\n\nAnd--more surprising--why she'd called him at FBI headquarters, when\nshe must have known that he wasn't there.\n\n\"Dr. O'Connor,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, somewhat relieved. \"At Yucca Flats.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"Right,\" he said.\n\n\"You're to call operator nine.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Malone went over to the phone, remembered his shoes and put\nthem down carefully on the floor. \"Anything else of importance?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"On the Cadillacs,\" Boyd said. \"We've got a final report now.\nLeibowitz and Hardin finally finished checking the last of them; there\nweren't quite as many as we were afraid there were going to be. Red\nisn't a very popular color around here.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And there isn't a doggone thing on any of 'em,\" Boyd said. \"Oh, we\ncleared up a lot of small-time crime, one thing and another, but\nthat's about all. No such thing as an electro-psionic brain to be\nfound anywhere in the lot. Leibowitz says he's willing to swear to\nit.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"I didn't think he'd find one,\" he said.\n\n\"You didn't?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd stabbed at him with the scissors again. \"Then why did you cause\nall that trouble?\" he said.\n\n\"Because I thought we might find electro-psionic brains,\" Malone said\nwearily. \"Or one, anyhow.\"\n\n\"But you just said--\"\n\nMalone picked up the phone, got long distance, and motioned Boyd to\nsilence in one sweeping series of moves. The long-distance operator\nsaid, \"Yes, sir? May we help you?\"\n\n\"Give me operator nine,\" Malone said.\n\nThere was a buzz, a click, and a new voice which said, \"Operator\nni-yun. May we help you?\"\n\n\"All nine of you?\" Malone muttered. \"Never mind. This is Kenneth\nMalone. I've got a call from Dr. Thomas O'Connor at Yucca Flats.\nPlease connect me.\"\n\nThere was another buzz, a click and an ungodly howl which was followed\nby the voice of operator ni-yun saying, \"We are connecting you. There\nwill be a slight delay. We are sor-ree.\"\n\nMalone waited. At last there was another small howl, and the screen\nlit up. Dr. O'Connor's face, as stern and ascetic as ever, stared\nthrough at Malone.\n\n\"I understand you called me,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"It's very good to see you again, Mr.\nMalone.\" He gave Malone a smile good for exchange at your corner\ngrocery; worth, one icicle.\n\n\"It's good to see you too,\" Malone lied.\n\n\"Mr. Burris explained to me what it was that you wanted to talk to me\nabout,\" O'Connor said, \"Am I to understand that you have actually\nfound a teleport?\"\n\n\"Unless my theories are away off,\" Malone said, \"I've done a lot\nbetter than that. I've found eight of them.\"\n\n\"Eight.\" Dr. O'Connor's smile grew perceptibly warmer. It now stood at\nabout thirty-four degrees Fahrenheit. \"That is really excellent, Mr.\nMalone. You have done a fine job.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone muttered. He wished that O'Connor didn't make him\nfeel quite so much like a first-year law student talking to an\negomaniacal professor.\n\n\"When can you deliver them?\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said carefully, \"that depends.\" O'Connor seemed to\nview the teleports as pieces of equipment, he thought. \"I can't\ndeliver them until I catch them,\" he said. \"And that's why I wanted to\ntalk to you.\"\n\n\"Some slight delay,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"will be quite\nunderstandable.\" His face left no doubt that he didn't like the\nnecessity of understanding anything that was going to keep him and the\neight teleports apart for even thirty seconds longer, now that he knew\nabout them.\n\n\"You see,\" Malone said, \"they're kids. Juvenile delinquents, or\nsomething like that. But they are teleports, that's for sure.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Dr. O'Connor said.\n\n\"So we've got to nab them,\" Malone said. \"And for that I need all the\ninformation I can get.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor nodded slowly. \"I'll be happy,\" he said, \"to give you any\ninformation I can provide.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath, and plunged. \"How does this teleportation\nbit work, anyhow?\" he said.\n\n\"You've asked a very delicate question,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Actually,\nwe can't be quite positive.\" His expression showed just how little he\nwanted to make this admission. \"However,\" he went on, brightening,\n\"there is some evidence which seems to show that it is basically the\nsame process as psychokinesis. And we do have quite a bit of empirical\ndata on psychokinesis.\" He scribbled something on a sheet of paper and\nsaid, \"For instance, there's this.\" He held the paper up to the screen\nso that Malone could read it.\n\nIt said:\n\n(m*d)/(f*t**2) = 1/k\n\nMalone looked at it for some seconds. At last he said, \"It's very\npretty. What the hell is it?\"\n\n\"This,\" Dr. O'Connor said, in a condescending tone of voice that\nmeant, You should have known all along, but you're just hopeless, \"is\nthe basic formula for the phenomenon, where _m_ is the mass in grams,\n_d_ is the distance in centimeters, _f_ is the force in dynes, and _t_\nis the time in seconds. _K_ is a constant whose value is not yet\nknown, and the numeral 1 is unity.\"\n\nMalone said, \"Hmm,\" and stared at the equation again. Somehow, the\nexplanation was not very helpful. The numeral 1 was unity. He\nunderstood that much, all right, but it didn't seem to do him any\ngood.\n\n\"As you can see,\" Dr. O'Connor went on, \"the greater the force, and\nthe longer time it is applied, the greater distance any given mass can\nbe moved. Or, contrariwise, the more mass, the greater mass, that is,\nthe easier it is to move it any given distance. This is, as you\nundoubtedly understand, not at all in contradistinction to physical\nphenomena.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said, feeling that something was expected of him, but not\nbeing quite sure what.\n\nDr. O'Connor frowned. \"I must admit,\" he said, \"that the uncertainty\nas to the constant _k_, and the lack of any real knowledge as to just\nwhat kind of force is being applied, have held up our work so far.\"\nThen his face smoothed out. \"Of course, when we have the teleports to\nwork with, we may derive a full set of laws which--\"\n\n\"Never mind that now,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But our work is most important, Mr. Malone,\" Dr. O'Connor said with a\nmotion of his eyebrows. \"As I'm sure you must understand.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, feeling if he'd been caught without his homework,\n\"of course. But if you don't mind--\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Malone?\" Dr. O'Connor said smoothly.\n\n\"What I want to know,\" Malone said, \"is this. What are the limitations\nof this--uh--phenomenon?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor brightened up thoroughly. \"Well, theoretically,\" he said,\n\"there do not appear to be any limitations. However, practical\nlimitations do exist. If the process is at all parallel with\npsychokinesis, or with levitation\"--he stared at Malone, as if daring\nhim to say that it wasn't--\"if that parallel exists, then the subject\nis mentally limited by his own physical strength.\"\n\nMalone said, \"What?\"\n\n\"Try and be patient, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said calmly. \"Please. As I\nwas saying, the subject is limited by his own physical strength. In\nother words, he cannot move psionically any subject larger than he can\nlift physically. This appears to be a psychological limitation\nwhich--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"You mean he couldn't carry off a building, or\nanything like that?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Nor, as a matter of fact, could\nhe carry off anything that was securely bolted down. I hope you follow\nme.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Malone said. \"But look here. Suppose you handcuffed him\nto, say, a radiator, or a jail cell bar.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Could he get _away_?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor appeared to consider this with some care. \"Well,\" he said\nat last, \"he certainly couldn't take the radiator with him, or the\ncell bar. If that's what you mean.\" He hesitated, looked slightly\nshamefaced, and then went on: \"But you must realize that we lack any\nreally extensive data on this phenomenon.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's why I'm so very anxious to get those subjects,\" Dr. O'Connor\nsaid.\n\n\"Dr. O'Connor,\" Malone said earnestly, \"that's just what I had in mind\nfrom the start. I've been going to a lot of extra trouble to make sure\nthat those kids don't get killed or end up in reform schools or\nsomething, just so you could work with them.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said gravely.\n\nMalone felt as if someone had given him a gold star. Fighting down the\nemotion, he went on: \"I know right now that I can catch one or two of\nthem. But I don't know for sure that I can hold one for more than a\nfraction of a second.\"\n\n\"I see your problem,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Believe me, Mr. Malone. I do\nsee your problem.\"\n\n\"And is there a way out?\" Malone said. \"I mean a way I can hold on to\nthem for--\"\n\n\"At present,\" Dr. O'Connor said heavily, \"I have no suggestions. I\nlack data.\"\n\n\"Oh, fine,\" Malone said. \"We need the kids to get the data, and we\nneed the data to get the kids.\" He sighed. \"Hooray for our side,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"There does appear to be something of a dilemma here,\" Dr. O'Connor\nadmitted sadly.\n\n\"Dilemma is putting it mildly,\" Malone said.\n\nDr. O'Connor opened his mouth, shut it, opened it again and said, \"I\nagree.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"maybe one of us will think of something. If\nanything does occur to you, let me know at once.\"\n\n\"I certainly will,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Believe me, Mr. Malone, I want\nyou to capture those kids just as badly as you want to capture them\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Malone said at random. He flipped off and turned with a\nsense of relief back to Boyd. But it looked as if Henry VIII had been\nhit on the head with a cow, or something equally weighty. Boyd looked\nglassy-eyed and slightly stunned.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Malone said. \"Sick?\"\n\n\"I'm not sick,\" Boyd said carefully. \"At least I don't think I'm sick.\nIt's hard to tell.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Teleporting!\" Boyd said. \"Juvenile delinquents!\"\n\nMalone felt a sudden twinge in the area of his conscience. He realized\nthat he had told Boyd nothing at all about what had been going on\nsince the discovery of the notebook two nights ago. He filled his\npartner in rapidly, while Boyd stood in front of the mirror and rather\nshakily attempted to trim his beard.\n\n\"That's why I had the car search continue,\" Malone said. \"I was fairly\nsure the fault wasn't in the cars, but the boys. But I had to make\nabsolutely sure.\"\n\nBoyd said, \"Oh,\" chopped a small section out of the center of his\nbeard and added, \"Damn. My hand's shaky.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"that's the story.\"\n\n\"It's a hell of a story,\" Boyd said. \"And I don't want you to think I\ndon't believe it. Because I don't.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That doesn't affect me,\" Boyd said. \"I'll go along with the gag. But\nenough is enough. Vanishing teenagers. Ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Just so you go along with me,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh, I'll go along,\" Boyd said. \"This is my vacation too, isn't it?\nWhat's the next move, Mastermind?\"\n\n\"We're going down to that warehouse,\" Malone said decisively. \"I've\ngot a hunch the kids have been hiding there ever since they left their\nhomes yesterday.\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Boyd said. \"What?\"\n\n\"You mean we're going down to the warehouse _tonight_?\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone nodded.\n\n\"I might have known,\" Boyd said. \"I might have known!\"\n\n\"Tom,\" Malone said. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Boyd said. \"Nothing at all. Everything's fine and\ndandy. I think I'm going to commit suicide, but don't let that bother\nyou.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd stared at him. \"You happened,\" he said. \"You and the teen-agers\nand the bloody damn warehouse happened. Three days' work--ruined.\"\n\nMalone scratched his head, found out that his head still hurt and put\nhis hand down again. \"What work?\" he said.\n\n\"For three days,\" Boyd said, \"I've been taking this blonde chick all\nover New York. Wining her. Dining her. Spending money as if I were\nBurris himself, instead of the common or garden variety of FBI agent.\nNight clubs. Theaters. Bars. The works. Malone, we were getting along\nfamously. It was wonderful.\"\n\n\"And tonight--\" Malone said.\n\n\"Tonight,\" Boyd said, \"was supposed to be the night. The big night.\nThe payoff. We've got a date for dinner--T-bone steak, two inches\nthick, with mushrooms. At her apartment, Malone. She will probably--\"\n\n\"You'll have to break it,\" Malone said sympathetically. \"Too bad, but\nit can't be helped now. You can pick up a sandwich before you go.\"\n\n\"A sandwich,\" Boyd said with great dignity, \"is not my idea of\nsomething to eat.\"\n\n\"Look, Tom--\" Malone began.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Boyd said tiredly. \"Duty is duty. I'll go call\nher.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"And meanwhile, I'll get us a little insurance.\"\n\n\"Insurance?\"\n\n\"John Henry Fernack,\" Malone said, \"and his Safe and Loft Squad.\"\n\n\n                                  12\n\nThe warehouse was locked up tight, all right, Malone thought. In the\ndim light that surrounded the neighborhood, it stood like a single\nstone block, alone near the waterfront. There were other buildings\nnearby, but they seemed smaller; the warehouse loomed over Malone and\nBoyd threateningly. They stood in a shadow-blacked alley just across\nthe street, watching the big building nervously, studying it for weak\npoints and escape areas.\n\nBoyd whispered softly, \"Do you think they have a look-out?\"\n\nMalone's voice was equally low. \"We'll have to assume they've got at\nleast one kid posted,\" he said. \"But they can't be watching all the\ntime. Remember, they can't do everything.\"\n\n\"They don't have to,\" Boyd said. \"They do quite enough for me. Do you\nrealize that, right now, I could be--\"\n\n\"Break it up,\" Malone said. He took a small handset from his pocket\nand pressed the stud. \"Lynch?\" he whispered.\n\nA tinny voice came from the earpiece. \"Here, Malone.\"\n\n\"Have you got them located yet?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Lynch's voice replied. \"We're working on a triangulation\nnow. Just hold on for a minute or so. I'll let you know as soon as\nwe've got results.\"\n\nThe police squads--Lynch and his men, the warehouse precinct men, and\nthe Safe and Loft Squad--had set up a careful cordon around the area,\nand were now hard at work trying to determine two things.\n\nFirst, they had to know whether there was anybody in the building at\nall.\n\nSecond, they had to be able to locate anyone in the building with\nprecision.\n\nThe silence of the downtown warehouse district helped. They had\nseveral specially designed, highly sensitive directional microphones\naimed at the building from carefully selected spots around the area,\ntrying to pick up the muffled sounds of speech or motion within the\nwarehouse. The watchmen in buildings nearby had been warned off for\nthe time being so that their footsteps wouldn't occlude any results.\n\nMalone waited, feeling nervous and cold. Finally Lynch's voice came\nthrough again. \"We're getting something, all right,\" he said. \"There\nare obviously several people in there. You were right, Malone.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"How about that fix?\"\n\n\"Hold it a second,\" Lynch said. Wind swept off the river at Malone and\nBoyd. Malone closed his eyes and shivered. He could smell fish and\niodine and waste, the odor of the Hudson as it passes the city. Across\nthe river lights sparkled warmly. Here there was nothing but darkness.\n\nA long time passed, perhaps ten seconds.\n\nThen Lynch's voice was back. \"Sergeant McNulty says they're on the top\nfloor, Malone,\" he said. \"Can't tell how many for sure. But they're\ntalking and moving around.\"\n\n\"It's a shame these things won't pick up the actual words at a\ndistance,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Just a general feeling of noise is all we get,\" Lynch said. \"But it\ndoes some good.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Now listen carefully. Boyd and I are going in.\nAlone.\"\n\nLynch's voice whispered, \"Right.\"\n\n\"If those mikes pick up any unusual ruckus--any sharp increase in the\nnoise level--come running,\" Malone said. \"Otherwise, just sit still\nand wait for my signal. Got that?\"\n\n\"Check,\" Lynch said.\n\nMalone pocketed the radiophone. \"Okay, Tom,\" he whispered. \"This is\nit.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Boyd muttered. \"Let's move in.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. He took his goggles and brought them\ndown over his eyes, adjusting the helmet on his head. Boyd did the\nsame. Malone flicked on the infrared flashlight he held in his hand.\n\n\"Okay?\" he whispered. \"Check,\" Boyd said.\n\nThanks to the goggles, both of them could see the normally invisible\nbeams of the infrared flashlight. They'd equipped themselves to move\nin darkness without betraying themselves, and they'd be able to see\nwhere a person without equipment would be blind.\n\nMalone stayed well within the shadows as he moved silently around to\nthe alley behind the warehouse, and then to a narrow passageway that\nled to the building next door. Boyd followed a few feet behind him\nalong the carefully planned route.\n\nMalone unlocked the small door that led into the ground floor of the\nbuilding adjoining. As he did so, he heard a sound behind him and\ncalled, \"Tom?\"\n\n\"Hey, Malone,\" Boyd whispered. \"It's--\"\n\nBefore there was any outcry, Malone rushed back. Boyd was struggling\nwith a figure in the dimness. Malone grabbed the figure and clamped\nhis hand over its mouth. It bit him. He swore in a low voice, and\nclamped the hand over the mouth again.\n\nIt hadn't taken him more than half a second to realize what, whoever\nit was who struggled in his arms, it wasn't a boy.\n\n\"Shut up!\" Malone hissed in her ear. \"I won't hurt you.\"\n\nThe struggle stopped immediately. Malone gently eased his hand off the\ngirl's mouth. She turned and looked at him.\n\n\"Kenneth Malone,\" she said, \"you look like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\"Dorothea!\" Malone gasped. \"What are you doing here? Looking for your\nbrother?\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" she said. \"You play too rough. I'm going home to\nMother.\"\n\n\"Answer me!\" Malone said.\n\n\"All right,\" Dorothea said. \"You must know anyhow, since you're\nhere.... Yes, I'm looking for that fatheaded brother of mine. But now\nI suppose it's too late. He'll--he'll go to prison.\"\n\nHer voice broke. Malone found his shoulder suddenly occupied by a\ncrying face.\n\n\"No,\" he said quickly. \"No. Please. He won't.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nBoyd whispered: \"Malone, what is this? It's a hell of a place for a\ndate. And I--\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Malone told him in a kindly fashion. He turned back to\nDorothea. \"I promise he won't,\" he said. \"If I can just talk to your\nbrother, make him listen to reason, I think we can get him and the\nothers off. Believe me.\"\n\n\"But you--\"\n\n\"Please,\" Malone said. \"Believe me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ken,\" Dorothea said, raising her head. \"Do you mean it?\"\n\n\"Sure I mean it,\" Malone said. \"What have I been saying? The\nGovernment needs these kids.\"\n\n\"The Government?\"\n\n\"It's nothing to worry about,\" Malone said. \"Just go on home now, and\nI'll call you tomorrow. Late tonight, if I can. All right?\"\n\n\"No,\" Dorothea said. \"It's not all right. Not at all.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nBoyd hissed, \"Malone!\"\n\nMalone ignored him. He had a bigger fight on his hands. \"I'm not going\nhome,\" Dorothea announced. \"I'm going in there with you. After all,\"\nshe added, \"I can talk more sense into Mike's head than you can.\"\n\n\"Now look,\" Malone began.\n\nDorothea grinned in the darkness. \"If you don't take me along,\" she\nsaid quietly, \"I'll scream and warn them.\"\n\nMalone surrendered at once. He had no doubt at all that Dorothea meant\nwhat she said. And, after all, the girl might really be some use to\nthem. And there probably wouldn't be much danger.\n\nOf course there wouldn't, he thought. He was going to see to that.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Come along. Stick close to us, and don't worry\nabout the darkness. We can see, even if you can't, so let us guide\nyou. And for heaven's sake be quiet!\"\n\nBoyd whispered, \"Malone, what's going on?\"\n\n\"She's coming with us,\" Malone said, pointing to Dorothea.\n\nBoyd shrugged. \"Malone,\" he said, \"who do you think you are? The Pied\nPiper of Hamelin?\"\n\nMalone wheeled and went ahead. Opening the door, he played his I-R\nflashlight on the room inside and he, Boyd, and Dorothea trailed in,\ngoing through rooms piled with huge boxes. They went up an iron\nstairway to the second floor, and so on up to the roof.\n\nThey moved quickly across the roof to the wall of the warehouse, which\nwas two stories higher than the building they were on. Of course there\nwere no windows in the warehouse wall facing them, except on the top\nstory.\n\nBut there was a single, heavy, fireproof emergency exit. It would have\ntaken power machinery or explosive to open that door from the outside\nwithout a key, although from the inside it would open easily.\nFortunately, Malone had a key.\n\nHe took it out and stepped aside. \"Give that lock the works,\" he\nwhispered to Boyd.\n\nBoyd took a lubricant gun from his pocket and fired three silent shots\nof special oil into the lock. Then he shot the hinges, and the cracks\naround the door.\n\nThey waited for a minute or two while the oil, forced in under\npressure, did its work. Then Malone fitted the key carefully into the\nlock and turned it, slowly and delicately.\n\nThe door swung open in silence. Malone slipped inside, followed by\nBoyd and Dorothea Fueyo.\n\nInfrared equipment went on again, and the eerie illumination spread\nover their surroundings. Malone tapped Boyd on the shoulder, and\njerked his thumb toward the back stairs. This was plainly no time for\ntalk.\n\nFrom the floor above, they could hear the murmur of youthful voices.\n\nThey started for the stairway. Fortunately, the building was of the\nsteel-and-concrete type; there were no wooden floors to creak and\ngroan beneath their feet.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, they paused. Voices came down the\nstairwell clearly, even words being defined in the silence.\n\n\"...and quit harping on whose fault it was.\" Malone recognized Mike\nFueyo's voice. \"That FBI guy was onto us, and we had to pull out; you\nknow that. We always figured we'd have to pull out some day. So why\nnot now?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" another voice said. \"But you didn't have to go and vanish\nright under that Fed's nose. You been beating it into our heads not to\ndo that sort of stuff ever since we first found out we could make this\nvanishing bit. And then you go and do it in front of a Fed. Sure, you\ngot a big bang out of it, but is it smart? I ask you--\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Mike said. \"Listen, Silvo, they never would've got onto us if\nit hadn't been for your stupid tricks. Slugging a cop on the dome.\nCracking up a car. You and your bug for speed!\"\n\nMalone blinked. Then it hadn't been Miguel Fueyo who'd hit Sergeant\nJukovsky, but Silvo. Malone tried to remember the list of Silent\nSpooks. Silvo Envoz--that was his name.\n\n\"You slugged the FBI guy, Mike,\" Silvo said. \"And now you got us all\non the run. That's your fault, Mike. I want to see my old lady.\"\n\n\"I had to slug him,\" Mike said. \"Listen, all Ramon's stuff was in that\nCadillac. What would've happened if he'd found all that stuff?\"\n\n\"So what happened anyway?\" a third voice said (That was probably\nRamon Otravez, Malone thought.) \"He found your stupid notebook, didn't\nhe? He went yelling to the cops, didn't he? We're running, ain't we?\nSo what's the difference?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Mike roared.\n\n\"You ain't telling me to shut up!\"\n\n\"Me either,\" Silvo yelled. \"You think you're a great big big-shot! You\nthink you're king of the world!\"\n\n\"Who figured out the Vanish?\" Mike screamed. \"You'd all be a bunch of\nbums if I hadn't showed you that! And you know it! You'd all--\"\n\n\"Don't give us that,\" Silvo said. \"We'd have been able to do it, same\nas you. Like you said, anybody who's got talent could do it. There\nwere guys you tried to teach--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said a fourth voice. \"Listen, Fueyo, you're so bright--so why\ndon't you try teaching it to somebody who don't have the talent?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said voice number five. \"You think you could teach that flashy\nsister of yours the Vanish?\"\n\n\"You shut up about my sister, Phil!\" Mike screamed.\n\n\"So what's so great about her?\"\n\n\"She got that book back from the Fed,\" Mike said. \"That's what. It's\nenough!\"\n\n\"Hell,\" a voice said, \"any dame with a little--\"\n\n\"Shut your goddamn face before I shut it for you!\"\n\nMalone couldn't tell who was yelling what at who after a minute. They\nall seemed unhappy about being on the run from the police, and they\nwere all tired of being cooped up in a warehouse under Mike's orders.\nMike was the only person they could take it out on--and Mike was under\nheavy attack.\n\nTwo of the boys, surprisingly, seemed to side with him. The other five\nwere trying to outshout them. Malone wondered if it would become a\nfight, and then realized that these kids could hardly fight each other\nwhen the one who was losing could always fade out.\n\nHe leaned over and whispered to Dorothea and Boyd, \"Let's sneak up\nthere while the argument's going on.\"\n\n\"But--\" Boyd began.\n\n\"Less chance of their noticing us,\" Malone explained, and Started\nforward.\n\nThey tiptoed up the stairs and got behind a pile of crates in the\nshadows, while invective roared around them. This floor was lit by a\nsingle small bulb hanging from a socket in the ceiling. The windows\nwere hung with heavy blankets to keep the light from shining out.\n\nThe kids didn't notice anything except each other. Malone took a\ncouple of deep breaths and began to look around.\n\nAll things considered, he thought, the kids had fixed the place up\npretty nicely. The unused warehouse had practically been made over\ninto an apartment. There were chairs, beds, tables, and everything\nelse in the line of furnishings for which the kids could conceivably\nhave any use. There were even some floor lamps scattered around, but\nthey weren't plugged in. Malone guessed that a job would have to be\ndone on the warehouse wiring to get the floor lamps in operation, and\nthe kids just hadn't got around to it yet.\n\nBy now the boys were practically standing toe-to-toe, ripping\nair-blueing epithets at each other. Not a single hand was lifted.\n\nMalone stared at them for a second, then turned to Dorothea. \"We'll\nwait till they calm down a little,\" he whispered. \"Then you go out and\ntalk to them. Tell them we won't hurt them or lock them up or\nanything. All we want to do is talk to them for awhile.\"\n\n\"All right,\" she whispered back.\n\n\"They can vanish any time they want to,\" Malone said, \"so there's no\nreason for them not to listen to--\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly, listening. Over the shouting, screaming, and\ncursing of the kids, he heard motion on the floor below.\n\nCops?\n\nIt couldn't be, he told himself. But when he took out his radiophone,\nhis hands were shaking a little.\n\nLynch's voice was already coming over it when Malone thumbed it on.\n\n\"...so hang on, Malone! I repeat: We heard the ruckus, and we're\ncoming in! We're on our way! Hang on, Malone!\"\n\nThe voice stopped. There was a click.\n\nMalone stared at the handset, fascinated and horrified. He swallowed.\n\"No, Lynch!\" he whispered, afraid to talk any louder for fear the kids\nwould hear him. \"No! Don't come up. Go away. Repeat: Go away! Stay\naway, Lynch!\"\n\nIt was no use. The radiophone was dead.\n\nLynch, apparently thinking Malone's set had been smashed in the fight,\nor else that Malone was unconscious, had shut his own receiver off.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing that Malone could do.\n\nThe kids were still yelling at the top of their voices, but the\nthundering of heavy, flat feet galumphing up from the lower depths\ncouldn't be ignored for long. All the boys noticed it at about the\nsame time. They jerked their heads round to face the stairway. Malone\nand his compatriots crouched lower behind the boxes.\n\nMike Fueyo was the first to speak. \"Don't vanish yet,\" he snapped.\n\"Let's see who it is.\"\n\nThe internal dissent among the Silent Spooks disappeared as if it had\nnever been, as they faced a common foe. Once again they fell naturally\nunder Fueyo's leadership. \"If it's cops,\" he said, \"we'll give 'em the\ngrasshopper play we worked out. We'll show 'em.\"\n\n\"They can't fool with us,\" another boy said. \"Sure. The grasshopper\nplay.\"\n\nIt was cops, all right. Lieutenant Lynch ran up the stairs waving his\nbilly in a heroic fashion, followed by a horde of blue-clad officers.\n\n\"Where's Malone?\" Lynch shouted as he came through the doorway.\n\n\"Where's your what?\" Mike yelled back, and the fight was on.\n\nLater, Malone thought that he should have been surprised, but he\nwasn't. There wasn't any time to be surprised. The kids didn't\ndisappear.\n\nThey spread out over the floor of the room easily and lightly, and the\ncops charged them in a great blundering mass.\n\nNaturally, the kids winked out one by one--and re-formed in the center\nof the cops' muddle. Malone saw one cop raise his billy and swing it\nat Mike. Mike watched it come down and vanished at the last instant.\nThe cop's billy descended on the head of another cop, standing just\nbehind where Mike had been.\n\nThe second cop, blinded by the blow on his head, swung back and hit\nthe first cop. Meanwhile, Mike was somewhere else.\n\nMalone stayed crouched behind the boxes. Dorothea stood up and\nshouted, \"Mike! Mike! We just want to talk to you!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the police were making such a racket that this could\nnot be heard more than a foot or so from the speaker. Lynch himself\ncharged into the mass, swinging his billy and his free fist, and\nlaying others out one after the other. Pretty soon the floor was\nlittered with cops. Lynch was doing yeoman duty, but it was hard to\ntell what side he was on.\n\nThe vanishing trick Mike had worked out was being used by all of the\nkids. Cops were hitting other cops, Lynch was hitting everybody, and\nthe kids were winking on and off all over the loft. It was a scene of\ntremendous noise and carnage.\n\nMalone suddenly sprang to his feet and charged into the melee,\nshouting at the top of his lungs and swinging both fists. The first\nperson he saw was one of the teen-agers, and he charged him with\nabandon.\n\nHe should, he reflected, have known better. The kid disappeared.\nMalone caromed off the stomach of a policeman, received a blow on the\nshoulder from his billy, and rebounded into the arms of a surprised\npolice officer at the edge of the battle.\n\n\"Who're you?\" the officer gasped.\n\n\"Malone,\" Malone said.\n\n\"You on our side?\"\n\n\"How about you?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'm a lieutenant here,\" the officer said. \"In charge of the warehouse\nprecinct. I--\"\n\nMalone and the lieutenant stepped nimbly aside as another cop careened\nby them, waving his billy helplessly. They looked away as the crash\ncame. The cop had fallen over a table, and now lay with his legs in\nthe air, supported by the overturned table, blissfully unconscious.\n\n\"We seem,\" Malone said, \"to be in an area of some activity. Let's\nmove.\"\n\nThey shifted away a few feet. Malone looked into the foray and saw\nBoyd at work, roaring and going after the kids. One of them had\nestablished a kind of game with him. He appeared just in front of\nBoyd, who rushed at him, arms outstretched. As Boyd almost reached\nhim, the kid disappeared, and reappeared again just behind Boyd. He\ntapped the FBI agent gently on the shoulder; Boyd turned and the\nprocess was repeated.\n\nBoyd seemed to be getting winded.\n\n\"Damn kids,\" the lieutenant muttered suddenly, and dashed back into\nthe fray. Malone looked around, saw Mike Fueyo flickering in and out\nat the edges, and headed for him.\n\nA cop swung at Mike, missed, and hit Malone on the arm. Malone swore.\nThe cop backed off, looking in a bewildered fashion for his victim,\nwho was nowhere in sight. Then Malone caught sight of him, at the\nother edge of the fight. He started to work his way around.\n\nHe tried to avoid blows, but it wasn't always possible. A reeling cop\ncaught his lapel and tore it, and Lynch, indefatigable in battle,\nmanaged to graze his chin with a blow meant for one of the\ndisappearing boys. Other cops were battling each other, going after\nthe kids and clutching empty air, cursing and screaming unheard orders\nin the fracas.\n\nMalone ducked past Lynch, rubbed at his chin and looked for Mike. In\nthe tangle of bodies it was getting hard to see. There was the sound\nof breaking ceramics as a floor lamp went over, and then a table\nfollowed it, but Malone avoided both. He looked for Mike Fueyo.\n\nA cop clutched him around the middle, out of nowhere, said, \"Sorry,\nbuddy. Who the hell are you?\" and dove back into the mass of bodies.\nMalone caught his breath and forged onward.\n\nThere was Mike, at the edge of the fight, watching everything coolly.\nNo cop was near him. In the dim light the place looked like a scene\nfrom hell, a special hell for policemen.\n\nMalone wove through battling hordes to the edge, and came out a few\nfeet away from Mike Fueyo.\n\nFueyo didn't see him. He was looking at Boyd instead--still stumbling\nback and forth as the teen-ager baiting him winked on and off in front\nof him and behind him. He was laughing.\n\nMalone came up silently from behind. The trip seemed to take hours. He\nwas being very quiet, although he was reasonably sure that even if he\nyelled he wouldn't be heard. But he didn't want to take the slightest\nchance.\n\nHe sprang on Mike, and attached the handcuffs to his wrist and to\nMike's wrist within ten seconds.\n\n\"Ha!\" he said involuntarily. \"Now come with me!\"\n\nHe gave his end of the handcuffs a tremendous yank.\n\nHe started to stagger, trailing an empty cuff behind him, flailing his\narms wildly. Ahead of him he could see a big cop with an upraised\nbilly. Malone tried to alter his course, but it was too late. He\nskidded helplessly into the cop, who jerked round and swung the billy\nautomatically. Malone said: \"Ugh,\" as he caught the blow on the\ncheekbone, bounced off the cop and kept going.\n\nHe careened past a blur of figures, trying to avoid hard surfaces and\nother human beings. But there was--\n\nOh, no, Malone thought. Lynch.\n\nLynch was ready to swing. His fist was cocked, and he was heading for\none of the teen-agers with murder in his eye. Malone knew their paths\nwere going to intersect. \"Watch out,\" he yelled. \"Watch out, it's me!\nStop me! Somebody stop me!\" He went completely unheard.\n\nLynch swung and missed, hitting a cop who had been hiding behind the\nteen-ager. The cop went down to join the wounded, and Lynch roared\nlike a bull and swung around, looking for more enemies.\n\nThat was when Malone hit him.\n\nLong afterward, he remembered Lynch's hat sailing through the air, and\nlanding in the center of a struggling mass of policemen. He remembered\nLynch saying, \"So there you are!\" and swinging before he looked.\n\nHe remembered the blow on the chin.\n\nAnd then he remembered falling, and falling, and falling. Somewhere\nthere was a voice: \"Where the hell are they? They've disappeared for\ngood.\"\n\nAnd then, for long seconds, nothing.\n\nHe woke up with a headache, but it wasn't too bad. Surprisingly, not\nmuch time had passed; he got up and dusted off his trousers, looking\naround at the battlefield. Wounded and groaning cops were lying all\nover. The room was a shambles; the walking wounded--which comprised\nthe rest of the force--were stumbling around in a slow, hopeless sort\nof fashion.\n\nLynch was standing next to him. \"Malone,\" he said, \"I'm sorry. I hit\nyou, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Malone said. \"You seemed to be hitting every body.\"\n\n\"I was _trying_ for the kids,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"So was I,\" Malone said. \"I got the cuffs on one and yanked him along,\nbut he disappeared and left me with the cuffs.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Lynch said. \"Hell of a raid.\"\n\n\"Very jolly,\" Malone agreed. \"Fun and games were had by all.\"\n\nA cop stumbled up, handed Lynch his cap and disappeared without a\nword. Lynch stared mournfully at it. The emblem was crushed, and the\ncap looked rather worn and useless. He put it on his head, where it\nassumed the rakish tilt of a hobo's favorite tam-o'-shanter, and said,\n\"I hope you're not thinking of blaming _me_ for this fiasco.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said nobly. He hurt all over, but on reflection\nhe thought that he would probably live. \"It was nobody's fault.\"\nExcept, he thought, his own. If he'd only told Lynch to come in when\ncalled for--and under no other circumstances--this wouldn't have\nhappened. He looked around at the remains of New York's Finest, and\nfelt guilty.\n\nThe lieutenant from the local precinct limped up, rubbing a\nwell-kicked shin and trying to disentangle pieces of floor lamp from\nhis hair. \"Listen, Lynch,\" he said, \"What's with these kids? What's\ngoing on here? Look at my men.\"\n\n\"Some days,\" Lynch said, \"it just doesn't pay to get up.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the local man said. \"But what do I do now?\"\n\n\"Make your reports.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"To the Commissioner,\" Lynch said, \"and to nobody else. If this gets\ninto the papers, heads will roll.\"\n\n\"My head is rolling right now,\" the local man said. \"Know what one of\nthose kids did? Stood in front of a floor lamp. I swung at him and he\nvanished. Vanished! I hit the lamp, and then the lamp hit me.\"\n\n\"Just see that this doesn't get out,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"It can't,\" the local man said. \"Anybody who mentioned this to a\nreporter would just be laughed out of town. It's not possible.\" He\npaused thoughtfully, and added, \"We'd all be laughed out of town.\"\n\n\"And probably replaced with the FBI,\" Lynch said morosely. He looked\nat Malone. \"Nothing personal, you understand,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said. \"We can't do any more here, can we?\"\n\n\"I don't think we can do any more anywhere,\" Lynch said. \"Let's lock\nthe place up and leave and forget all about it.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"I've got work to do.\" He looked around, found\nDorothea and signaled to her. \"Come on, Dorothea. Where's Boyd?\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" Boyd said, walking slowly across the big room to Malone.\nHe had one hand held to his chin.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Malone asked.\n\nBoyd took his hand away. There was a bald spot the size of a quarter\non the point of his chin. \"One of those kids,\" he said sadly, \"has a\nhell of a strong grip. Come on, Miss Fueyo. Come on, Malone. Let's get\nout of here.\"\n\n\n                                  13\n\n\"Logically,\" Malone said, \"there has to be _some_ way to catch them.\"\nHe looked around the hotel room as though he expected to find an\nanswer painted in big black letters on the wall. \"Logically,\" he said\nagain, and tried to think of what came next. He liked the sound of the\nword, but that was as far as it went.\n\n\"That's fine,\" Boyd said. He sat on a chair, staring gloomily at the\nfloor and rubbing the bald spot on his chin with a single, sad,\ninquisitive forefinger. \"There has to be an answer. You're probably\nright. But what the hell is it?\"\n\nMalone started to answer, and then wondered what he had been going to\nsay. He sunk himself in thought. There was a knock at the door. \"Who's\nthere?\" he called, glad of any relief at all.\n\n\"It's me,\" a small voice said. \"Dorothea.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" Malone said.\n\nThe door opened. Dorothea came in, shut the door behind her, and\nlooked around the room a little awkwardly.\n\n\"Did you get a good night's sleep?\" Malone said.\n\nShe nodded. \"I guess so,\" she said. \"Sure. It was nice of you to get\nme a room for the night. I mean, I guess I was--well...\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" Malone said grandly. \"You were upset and tired, that's\nall. Hell, in the car on the way back here last night, you fainted.\"\n\n\"I did not faint,\" she said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"you sure looked like--\"\n\n\"I was tired,\" Dorothea said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Okay. You were tired.\"\n\n\"You're not mad, are you,\" she said, \"because I stole your notebook?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Malone said. \"I said forget it, didn't I? Sit down\nand help us out.\"\n\n\"Help you?\" she said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Boyd said. \"Help us figure out how to catch this bunch\nof maniacs before they steal everything in New York.\"\n\nDorothea said, \"Maniacs? I--\" and Malone interrupted her in a hurry.\n\n\"Police Commissioner Fernack has called twice this morning already,\"\nhe said. \"He's screaming about all the burglaries that have been\noccurring since midnight last night.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Dorothea said. \"You mean the Spooks? Mike and the others?\nThey've been stealing again?\"\n\n\"They sure have, Miss Fueyo,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I guess they're furnishing their new hideout,\" Malone said. \"Wherever\nit is. Only God knows.\"\n\n\"And even if He told us,\" Boyd said, \"it wouldn't do us any good.\nChase 'em out of there, and they'd go somewhere else.\"\n\nMalone stood up, fished for his cigarettes and lit one. \"What we\nneed,\" he said, blowing out smoke, \"is some way to trap 'em and hold\n'em. And I don't see how we can do either.\"\n\n\"After last night,\" Dorothea said, \"I really don't see--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Boyd said. \"You said _trap_, didn't you?\" He looked\nslowly and speculatively at Dorothea Fueyo.\n\nA second passed.\n\n\"Oh, no, you don't!\" she said. \"Oh, no. Not on your life. I'll help\ncatch him if I can, because I know you don't mean to hurt him or the\nothers. But I wouldn't want Mike to know about it. You're not using me\nas bait in any trap.\"\n\nBoyd looked at Malone, shook his head slowly, and said disconsolately,\n\"Well, it was an idea.\" He returned his gaze to the floor.\n\nThe furtive gleam of the half bottle of bourbon on Malone's dresser\ncaught his eye. He'd had it sent up the night before, feeling the need\nof some medicinal refreshment. Now it winked at him. He ignored it\nresolutely. \"Dorothea,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Dorothea, do you have any idea how far one of those kids can go when\nhe teleports?\"\n\n\"No,\" Dorothea said. \"I really haven't any idea about any of it. Mike\ntried to teach me once, but I guess I just don't have the talent.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I wish I could help,\" Dorothea said.\n\nSilence fell, and gloom followed it.\n\nTime ticked by. The bourbon bottle resumed its seductive winking.\n\n\"There is one thing,\" Dorothea said suddenly. \"He did say one thing\nabout it.\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said eagerly.\n\n\"He said you couldn't teleport to some place you haven't been before.\nYou've got to be able to visualize where you're going.\"\n\nMalone said, \"Hmm.\" It seemed like the right answer. Dorothea's\nstatement was a fact, certainly, but he didn't see how the fact fit in\nanywhere.\n\n\"He didn't mention anything about distance, and I don't think any of\nthe Spooks ever tested it for that,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"There probably is a distance limit,\" Malone said. \"At least if Dr.\nO'Connor's theories are right. I just wish I knew what the limit was.\"\n\nSilence fell again. Malone sighed. Dorothea sighed. Boyd sighed,\nlooked around at the others and muttered, \"Damn thing's catching.\" He\ngot up and walked over to the dresser and picked up the bottle of\nbourbon.\n\n\"You, too?\" Malone murmured, but Boyd didn't hear him.\n\n\"I don't care if it is early in the morning,\" he said, resolutely. \"I\nneed a drink. I need something to take the fog out of my head,\nanyhow.\" He poured himself a shot, held the bottle aloft, and said,\n\"Dorothea? Malone?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\nMalone was tempted but he put Satan behind him with decision. \"No,\" he\nsaid firmly. \"The way I feel now, one drink would probably immobilize\nme.\"\n\nDorothea chuckled. \"You sound just like Mike,\" she said.\n\n\"Mike doesn't drink in the morning either?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Of course he doesn't,\" Boyd said. \"Mike is a nice kid. A swell kid.\"\n\n\"You keep quiet,\" Dorothea shot at him. She turned back to Malone.\n\"Mike never drinks at all,\" she said. \"He says it immobilizes\nhim--just what you said.\"\n\nSomewhere in the black galactic depths of Malone's mind, a very small\nhot star gulped, took a deep breath and became a supernova.\n\nThe light was tremendous! It shed beams over everything, beams of a\npositively supernal brilliance. And in the all-pervasive brightness of\nthat single inner light, bits of data began to fall into place with\nall the precision of aerial bombs, each falling neatly and exactly\ninto its own little predetermined bomb crater.\n\nIt was beautiful. It was magnificent. Malone felt all choked up.\n\nNone of the Silent Spooks drank. He remembered Kettleman telling him\nthat. And the Queen never touched the stuff either.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Malone, you look green.\"\n\n\"I feel green,\" Malone said. \"I feel like newly sprung grass. I feel\nas if I had just hatched out of something. I feel wonderful.\"\n\n\"It's the strain,\" Boyd said. \"That's what it is, strain. You've\ncracked at last.\"\n\nMalone ignored him. \"Tell me,\" he said to Dorothea with elaborate\ncasualness, \"when your brother says that, what does he mean?\"\n\n\"What?\" she said. \"Oh, I don't know. I--\" She stopped and her eyes\nwidened. \"You don't think that--\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Malone said. \"But we can sure as hell find out.\"\n\nDorothea blinked. \"What can you do?\" she said. \"I mean, to find out.\nYou can't force them to drink or anything, can you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"I can't do that. But it does give me an idea.\"\n\nBoyd held his untasted drink in his hand, staring at Malone and the\ngirl. \"What are you two talking about?\" he said. \"Or is this the\nspecial Captain Midnight code? I left my code ring home this week.\"\n\n\"Boyd,\" Malone snapped, \"get on the phone.\"\n\n\"Are you sure it will hold me?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I want you to call Dr. O'Connor at Yucca Flats,\" Malone said. \"Shut\nup and listen.\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\nFinally Boyd said, \"I don't hear anything.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said. \"I mean listen to me. I know it's pretty\nearly out where O'Connor is, but that doesn't matter now. Wake him up.\nWake everybody up, for all I care.\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Boyd said carefully, \"are you sure you haven't gone nuts?\"\n\nMalone grinned cheerfully. \"No,\" he said. \"Are you? Now listen: find\nout what effect drugs have on psionic abilities.\"\n\n\"Drugs?\" Boyd said, and then his eyes lit up. \"My God!\" he said. \"We\nmight have something, at that!\"\n\n\"Get the Queen up too,\" Malone said. \"Ask her the same question. I\nhope we do have something.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"And if we get the information we're hoping to get, I want Her Majesty\non the first plane to New York,\" Malone said. \"I don't care what\nstrings you have to pull to get that done. Call Burris if you have to.\nIt'll be worth it.\" Malone paused. \"Hell,\" he said, \"call him anyway\nand tell him what's happened. But get the Queen here!\"\n\n\"Right!\" Boyd said. He dove for the phone and started dialing.\nSuddenly he looked around. \"Hey!\" he yelled. \"Where are you going?\"\n\nMalone, one hand on the door, turned. \"Down to see Fernack,\" he said.\n\"I've got to make some arrangements. I'm betting we're right, Tom!\" He\ncharged out the door, slamming it. A second passed and it opened\nagain. Malone's head popped back in. \"Dorothea,\" he said. \"When Tom\ngets off the phone call your mother. Tell her you're going to be away\nfor a day or two--two at the most--and she's not to worry. We'll need\nyou, and her, too, to talk to Mike when the time comes. So stick\naround.\"\n\nThen he was gone.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nTwelve hours later, Kenneth J. Malone was sitting quietly in a small\nroom at the rear of a sporting-goods store on upper Madison Avenue,\ntrying to remain calm and hoping that the finest, most beautiful hunch\nhe had ever had in his life was going to pay off. With him were Boyd\nand two agents from the 69th Street office. They were sitting quietly\ntoo, but there was a sense of enormous excitement in the air. Malone\nwanted to get up and walk around, but he didn't dare. He clamped his\nhands in his lap and sat tight.\n\nThey waited in silence, not daring to talk. There was no sound except\nfor the faint whoosh of their breathing through the gas masks they\nwere wearing, and the muffled hiss from a tank nearby.\n\nThere was no reason why the plan shouldn't work. Malone told himself.\n\nIt looked foolproof. But he didn't believe it would work. This was the\ntime, he assured himself, that his luck ran out. He'd been lucky for\ntoo long, and now the wheel was going to turn and he'd be lost. All he\ncould do was wait for it, and hope.\n\nHer Majesty had said definitely that this would be the place the\nSpooks would hit tonight. She had no doubts about it. And Malone\ncouldn't think of a single reason why she might be wrong. But maybe\nhe'd got the address mixed up. Maybe the Spooks were somewhere else\nright now, robbing what they pleased, safe from capture....\n\nHis hunch about drugs had been correct, or at least everybody had said\nit was correct. Dr. O'Connor had assured Boyd that the deleterious\neffects of drugs on psionic abilities had been known ever since the\nearly days of Dr. Rhine's pioneering work, more than twenty years\nbefore. And Good Queen Bess had admitted the same thing. She never\ndrank, she said, because on the one occasion when she'd tried it,\nshe'd lost her telepathic ability, and \"My goodness, it was just like\ngoing blind.\"\n\nBurris had had to put on the pressure, but it had worked. The Queen\nhad been flown to New York, under psychiatric guard just as soon as\npossible after Boyd's phone call, and she'd been able to pick up Mike\nFueyo without any trouble at all as soon as she was within the same\ncity, and close enough to him.\n\nIt doesn't do much good to know where a teleporter _is_, Malone\nthought. But it's extremely handy to know where he's _going to be_.\nAnd if you also know what he plans to do when he gets where he's\ngoing, you've got an absolute lead-pipe cinch to work with.\n\nThe Queen had provided that lead-pipe cinch. Reading Mike's mind,\nshe'd told Malone that he planned to raid the sporting-goods store\nwith the rest of the Spooks that night. Lucky again, Malone thought;\nhe might have had to wait two or three days before the Spooks set up a\nrobbery.\n\nBut, of course, he might just be riding for some kind of horrible,\nunforeseen fall.\n\nThe main part of the sporting-goods store was fairly well lit, even at\nnight, though it was by no means brightly illuminated. There were\nshow-window lights on, and the street lamp from outside cast a nice\nglow. But the back room was dark, and the four men there were well\nconcealed. A curtain closed the room off, and Malone watched the front\nof the store through a narrow opening in it. He stared through it\nuntil his eyes ached, afraid to blink in case he missed the appearance\nof the Spooks. Everything had to go off just right, precisely on\nschedule.\n\nAnd it was going to happen any minute, he told himself nervously. In\njust a few minutes, everything would be over.\n\nMalone held his breath.\n\nThen he saw the figure walk slowly by the glass front of the shop,\nlooking in with elaborate casualness. He was casing the joint, making\nsure there were none left in it.\n\nMike Fueyo.\n\nMalone tried to breathe, and couldn't.\n\nSeconds ticked by.\n\nAnd then--almost magically--they appeared. Eight of them, almost\nsimultaneously, in the center of the room.\n\nMike Fueyo spoke in a low, controlled voice. \"Okay, now,\" he said.\n\"Let's move fast. We--\"\n\nAnd that was all he said.\n\nThe odorless anesthetic gas that filled the room had its sudden\neffect. Fueyo dropped out like a light.\n\nThe other seven followed him within seconds. Ramon Otravez, the\ntallest of them, stayed on his feet a little longer than the rest,\nobviously trying with all his strength to teleport himself out of\ndanger, but the effects of the fast-working gas had already been felt.\nHe was, literally, too stunned to move.\n\nHe too slumped to the floor.\n\nFor a second after that, none of the men in the rear room moved.\n\nThen Malone said, \"All right, boys. Let's get them out of here. They\ncan't stay too long in this atmosphere.\" The men started forward into\nthe front room, toward the still bodies. \"Boyd,\" Malone said. \"Get out\nfront and wave the ambulance over here. I'll get the air-conditioners\nworking and stop the gas.\"\n\nHe reached down and turned off the valve on the gently hissing tank of\nanesthetic gas that sat on the floor near him. \"You guys get the\nkids,\" he said. \"And let's make it fast, okay?\"\n\n\n                                  14\n\n\"The one thing we had to worry about,\" Malone said, pouring some more\nchampagne into the two hollow-stemmed glasses, \"was whether it was\npossible to give them just enough synthecaine. Too little, and they'd\nstill be able to teleport. Too much, and they'd be too groggy.\"\n\nDorothea relaxed in her chair and looked around at the hotel room\nwalls with contentment. She looked like the proverbial cat who has\nswallowed the cream. \"It looked to me as if it worked,\" she said.\n\"Mike seemed pretty normal--except that he had that awful _trapped_\nfeeling.\"\n\nMalone handed her one of the filled glasses with an air. He was\nbeginning slowly to feel less like the nervous, uncertain Kenneth J.\nMalone, and more and more like Sir Kenneth Malone. \"I can see why he\nfelt trapped,\" he said. \"If a guy's been unhampered by four walls all\nthe time, even only for a year or so, he's certainly going to feel\npenned in when he loses the ability to get through them. It might be\njust a little claustrophobic.\" He grinned, proud of himself.\n\"Claustrophobic,\" he said again. \"My tongue and palate are in\nexcellent condition.\"\n\n\"The main thing is,\" Dorothea said, \"that everybody's so happy.\nCommissioner Fernack, even--with Mr. Burris promising to give him a\nmedal.\"\n\n\"And Lynch,\" Malone said reflectively. \"He'll get a promotion out of\nthis for sure. And good old Kettleman.\"\n\n\"Kettleman?\" Dorothea said. \"Oh, the funny fat man. He's some kind of\nsocial worker or something.\"\n\n\"And now he's getting a scroll from the FBI,\" Malone said. \"A citation\nfor coming up with the essential clue in this case. Even though he\ndidn't know it _was_ the essential clue. You know,\" he added\nreflectively, \"one thing puzzles me about that man.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"he worked in your neighborhood. You knew him.\"\n\n\"Of course I did,\" Dorothea said. \"We all knew Kettleman.\"\n\n\"He said he had a lot of success as a social worker,\" Malone said.\n\"Now, I've met him. And talked with him. And I just can't picture--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Dorothea said. \"We keep him around--kept him around, I mean--as\na sort of joke. A pet, or a mascot. Of course, he never did catch on.\nI don't suppose he has yet.\"\n\nMalone laughed. \"Nope,\" he said. \"He hasn't.\"\n\n\"And even your friend is happy,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Boyd?\" Malone said. \"Sure. He called his blonde and she was just\nthrilled at the adventures of an FBI agent, and he's with her now.\"\n\n\"You sound jealous,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"The hell I am,\" Malone said, and proceeded to prove his point. Some\nminutes later they relaxed.\n\n\"Mike,\" Dorothea said. \"What?\"\n\n\"Mike,\" she said. \"He's probably the happiest of all. After Mom and I\ntalked to him for a while, anyhow, and he began to lose that--that\n_trapped_ feeling. Now he's all excited about being an FBI man.\" She\nlooked worriedly at Malone for a second. \"You weren't kidding about\nthat, were you?\" she said.\n\nShe looked very pretty when she was worried. Malone leaned over and\nkissed her with great care. After a second, the kiss seemed to gain\nmomentum on its own, and all restraint went by the wayside. A long\ntime passed.\n\nThen, as Malone pulled away and began to recover his breath, he said\nweakly, \"You were saying?\"\n\n\"Was I?\" Dorothea said. \"Oh, yes. I was. About Mike being an FBI man.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Well, normally you've got to be a lawyer or an\naccountant, but there are a few special cases. And maybe Mike would\nfit into the special-case bracket. If he doesn't--well, he'll be doing\nsome sort of official work for the Government. You can be sure of\nthat.\"\n\n\"That woman in the costume--the one you call Your Majesty--certainly\nthrew a scare into the boys,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"we had to prove one thing to them. We can pick\nthem up at any time. You see, they've got to think about where they're\nteleporting, and as soon as they do that one of our telepaths--like\nthe Queen--will know where they're going to be. And we can crack\ndown.\"\n\n\"That's what she said,\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"After all, we did them quite a favor--getting\nthem out of all the trouble they'd gotten themselves into. If they try\nto--\"\n\n\"That reminds me, Ken,\" Dorothea said. \"All the things that were\nstolen. The liquor and all of that, Money. What's going to happen to\nthat?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"everything that can be returned--and that\nincludes most of the liquor, because they hadn't had a chance to get\nrid of it to the bootleggers around this area--will be returned. What\ncan't be returned--money, stuff that they've used, broken, or\nsold--well, I don't exactly know about that. It might take a special\nact of Congress,\" he said brightly.\n\n\"All for the boys?\" Dorothea said.\n\n\"Well, they'll be at Yucca Flats, and they'll be pretty useful,\"\nMalone said. \"And, as I was saying, if they try to run away from Yucca\nFlats, we'll just have to keep them drugged all the time, little as we\nwant to. They can be of some use that way, too. The Government isn't\ndoing all this for nothing.\"\n\n\"But keeping them drugged--\"\n\n\"I said we didn't want to do it. And I don't think we'll have to.\nThey'll be well taken care of, don't worry. Some of the best\npsychiatrists and doctors are out there. And Mike and the others--if\nthey can show they're trustworthy--can come home every weekend, or\neven every night if they can teleport that far.\" Malone paused. \"But\nit isn't charity,\" he added. \"We need people with specialized psionic\nabilities--and, for a variety of reasons, they're pretty hard to\nfind.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Dorothea said, \"you're pretty wonderful, Mr. Malone.\"\n\nMalone didn't answer her. He just kissed her again, not caring\nparticularly whether or not the kiss went wild.\n\nDorothea pushed him gently away. \"I'm envious,\" she announced.\n\"Everybody gets a reward but me. Do I get left out just because I\nswiped your notebook?\"\n\nMalone kissed her again. \"What kind of a reward do you want?\" he\nasked.\n\nShe sighed. \"Oh, well,\" she said. \"I suppose this is good enough.\"\n\n\"Good enough?\" Malone said. \"Just good enough?\"\n\nHis lips met hers for the fifth time. She reached one hand gently out\nto the light switch and pushed it.\n\nThe lights went out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Impossibles, by\nGordon Randall Garrett and Laurence Mark Janifer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IMPOSSIBLES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22338-8.txt or 22338-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/3/3/22338/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
