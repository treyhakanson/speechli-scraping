But the boy\n         and girl were very young and all Robin wanted to know\n         was: \"Who stole my doll?\"_\n\n\n A\n WORLD\n CALLED\n CRIMSON\n\n By\n DARIUS JOHN GRANGER\n\n\n_When the starship _Star of Fire_ collided with a meteor swarm six\nparsecs stellar north of the galactic hub in the year A.D. 2278, it lost\nits atmosphere within forty-five minutes. At first it was thought that\nevery man, woman and child of the four thousand, one hundred and\nsixty-six aboard were lost, in this the greatest of all interstellar\ndisasters. But as was discovered twenty years later in the Purcell\nexploration, this was not quite the case. (See PURCELL)_\n\n                                   _--from The ANNALS OF SPACE, Vol. 12_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: The Cyclops--not hungry at the moment--regarded Robin as\na new toy.]\n\nIt was the nasty little boy from B Deck who had stolen her doll. She\nhated him. He was horrid. She slipped out of their stateroom while her\nMom and Dad were dressing for dinner. She'd find that horrid little boy\non B Deck. She'd scratch his eyes out.\n\nHer name was Robin Sinclair and she was five years old and mad enough to\nthrow the boy from B Deck out into space, only she didn't know how to go\nabout that.\n\nShe went down the companionway to B Deck, where the people dressed\ndifferently. The colors weren't as bright, somehow, the cloth not so\nfine. It was a major distinction in the eyes of a five-year-old girl,\nespecially one who loved to run her fingers over fine synthetics and who\neven had a favorite color. Her favorite color was crimson.\n\n\"'Scuse me, mister. Didja see a little boy with a doll with a crimson\ndress on?\"\n\nA smile. But she was deadly serious. \"Not me, young lady.\"\n\nShe walked for a while aimlessly on B Deck. She saw two little boys, but\nthey weren't the right ones. Pouting now, almost in tears, she was on\nthe verge of giving up. Mom and Dad could buy her a new doll. Mom and\nDad were richer than anybody, weren't they?\n\nThen, all of a sudden, she saw him. He was just ducking out of sight up\nahead. Under his arm was tucked the doll with the crimson dress, her\nfavorite doll.\n\n\"Hey!\" she cried. \"Hey, wait for me!\"\n\nHer little feet pounding, she raced down the companionway. As she\nreached the irising door in the bulkhead, an electric eye opened it for\nher. She had never come this way before. It was not as bright and clean\nas the rest of the ship. She had not even seen the sign which said\nPASSENGERS NOT PERMITTED BEYOND THIS POINT. But then, she could barely\nread, anyway.\n\nShe caught a quick second glimpse of the boy, and started running as he\nrounded a turn in the corridor. Shouting for him to stop, she reached\nthe turn and saw him up ahead. He looked back at her and stuck out his\ntongue and kept running.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was then that the whole world shuddered, like it was trying to shake\nitself to pieces.\n\nAlarm bells clanged everywhere. Whistles shrilled. Pretty soon\nuniformed men were running in all directions. Robin Sinclair was\nsuddenly very frightened. She wanted to go back to A Deck, to her Mom\nand Dad, but she had followed the boy through so many twisting, turning\ncorridors that she knew she would be lost if she tried. She looked\nahead. The boy seemed confident as he made his way. She followed him.\nBut she was really mad at him now. It was his fault she was so far from\nMom and Dad when a thing like this happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUniformed members of the crew continued rushing by. She heard snatches\nof conversation she didn't understand.\n\n\"Trying to patch it ...\"\n\n\"The whole stern section of the ship. Losing air fast ...\"\n\n\"The lifeboats. I was just down there. Every last one of 'em. Gone. The\nmeteor took 'em right off into space.\"\n\n\"If the damage can't be repaired ...\"\n\nAnd one man, finally, with a face awful to behold: \"Patches won't hold.\nWe're losing air faster'n it can be replaced. Better tell the Captain.\"\n\nA man in a lot of gold braid rushed into view. He was\ndistinguished-looking, but old. Boy, he was old, Robin thought. He\nlooked as old as her grandfather.\n\n\"Captain! We're losing too much air. It can't be replaced.\"\n\n\"Then prepare to abandon ship.\"\n\n\"But, sir, every lifeboat is gone!\"\n\n\"No lifeboats? No lifeboats!\"\n\nThe boy stuck his tongue out again. She ran after him, shaking her\nlittle fist. They were completely absorbed in their private enmity while\nthe word went out that the situation was hopeless and almost five\nthousand people prepared to die.\n\n\"I've got you now!\"\n\nHe had run up against a blank wall. She came toward him, holding her\nhands out for the doll with the crimson dress. He held it behind his\nback. She reached around to get it but he pushed her and she fell down.\n\n\"I'll fix you!\" she threatened, getting up and rushing toward him again.\nBig arms came down, and big hands grabbed her.\n\n\"There now, little miss,\" a voice said. \"Why aren't you with your folks?\nTime like this, you ought to be with your folks. What is it, B Deck?\"\n\n\"A Deck,\" Robin said haughtily. \"_He's_ from B. Why is everybody running\naround so?\"\n\nHe was a tall, slat-thin man with a kind-looking face. \"Say, wait a\nminute!\" he suddenly said, looking perplexed. \"They all the time said I\nwas nuts, building that damn thing. Well, I can't fit into it, but maybe\nthese here kids can.\"\n\nHe scooped Robin up with one hand, got the boy with the other. \"I want\nmy doll!\" Robin cried, but the boy held it away from her.\n\n\"Take it easy now,\" the man said. \"Take it easy. We'll take care of\nyou.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe ran with them to one of the repair bays of the great, doom-bound\nstarship. In one corner, beyond the now useless patching equipment, was\na table. On the table stood a model of the _Star of Fire_. It was six\nfeet long and perfect in every external detail. He hadn't got around to\nthe inside yet. The inside was completely empty. It had rockets and\neverything. There was no reason why it wouldn't be perfectly\nspace-worthy. Why, it would even hold an atmosphere ...\n\n\"In you go!\" he said.\n\nThe little boy was suddenly scared. \"I want my Mother,\" he said. \"I\nwant my Dad.\"\n\n\"In you go.\"\n\nRobin felt herself lifted, and thrust inside something. It was dark in\nthere. She moved around and bumped into something. She moved around some\nmore and bumped against the little boy from B Deck.\n\n\"How do you get out of here?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said.\n\n\"I want my doll back,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\"You better give it to me.\"\n\nHe said nothing. There was a hissing sound, and a faint roar. Far away,\nsomething slid ponderously.\n\n\"Pleasant voyage, little ones!\" a voice boomed.\n\nSomething sat on her chest all at once, squeezing all the air from her.\nIt was a great weight holding her motionless, squeezing. She wanted to\ncry, but couldn't get the sound out. She wanted her Mom. Mom would know\nwhat to do.\n\nShe was crushed and flattened into a tunnel of blackness.\n\nThirty minutes later, the starship _Star of Fire_, outworld-bound from\nSol to the starswarms beyond Ophiuchus, lost all its remaining air. It\nbecame an enormous coffin spinning end over end in space amid the blaze\nof starlight near the center of the galaxy.\n\nOne tiny spaceship, a small model of the huge liner, sped away. If it\nwent two days finding no planet, its two occupants would perish when the\nsmall oxygen supply gave out. If it found a planet it would circle and\nland automatically. The possibility of this was small, but not remote.\nFor here at the center of the galaxy, stellar distances are more nearly\nplanetary and most of the stars have attendant planets. But even then,\nit would have to be a world capable of supporting their lives ...\n\nThey sped on, in all innocence. She was five. He was six. His name was\nCharlie Fullerton. He had her doll. She hated him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours after the tiny model spaceship landed on a planet with three\nsuns in the sky, Robin Sinclair awoke. She felt cramped and\nuncomfortable. It took her a while to orient herself. She had some kind\nof a dream. A dream was a funny thing. Mom said it wasn't real. But it\nsure was real to her.\n\nShe got up and pushed with her hands. A section of the tiny spaceship\nsprang away at her touch, admitting blinding light. She lay there with\nher eyes tightly shut, but after a while she could see. The boy was\nsleeping. She still hated him. He was sleeping with her doll in his\narms. She took the doll and he moved his arms and woke up. She jumped\nout of the open spaceship with the doll and started running.\n\nShe ran along a beach. But the sand was green. The ocean hissed and\nroared and there was nobody else. \"N'ya! N'ya! Y'can't catch me!\" she\nbawled at the top of her voice. And fell down in the sand.\n\nHe caught up with her and fell on top of her and they wrestled for the\ndoll. The surf thundered nearby. The tide, capricious in the grip of the\nthree suns, rose suddenly, flooding them with chill water. Coughing and\nspluttering and choking, they retreated further up the beach.\n\nSoon they quieted down.\n\n\"I'm soaking wet,\" she said.\n\n\"My name is Charlie,\" he said sullenly. \"Let's go back now.\"\n\n\"How do we go back?\" she wanted to know.\n\n\"That's a nice doll,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"You took it from me!\" Accusingly.\n\n\"Aw, I only wanted to look at it.\"\n\n\"She has a crimson dress and everything.\"\n\n\"This is some world,\" Charlie said after a while.\n\n\"What's a world?\"\n\n\"Oh, a world is--you know--everything.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"You think it has Indians?\"\n\nShe said, \"It ought to have Indians, anyhow.\"\n\n\"And pirates too?\" he asked in a voice full of awe.\n\nShe nodded her head very seriously. \"I like pirates,\" she said. \"They're\nso scarey.\"\n\nJust then a ship came into view far away across the water. It had\nenormous sails and a black hull. On the fore-sail was painted a huge\nblack skull.\n\n\"Let's get out of here!\" Charlie cried in alarm. But beetling cliffs\nreared behind the beach and although they ran frantically along at the\nedge of the green sand, they could find no way to scale the cliffs. The\npirate ship came closer and closer.\n\nThey got down whimpering at the base of the cliffs and remained very\nstill. After a long time the pirate ship came close to shore. A longboat\nwas dispatched and its oars flashed in the triple sunlight like giant\nlegs on which the longboat walked across the waves toward the beach.\n\nThen the pirates were ashore. The man who led them had only one leg, and\na peg. He looked very mean.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's Blackbeard the Pirate!\" said Charlie in a frightened whisper. His\nDad had once read him a story about Blackbeard.\n\nThe pirate with the wooden leg suddenly had a black beard.\n\n\"The doll!\" cried Robin.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"We left her down there. Crimson.\" She called her doll Crimson because\nshe had a crimson dress.\n\nNow Blackbeard approached the model spaceship with his crew. They\ngathered around it, frowning. Robin watched, her face pale, her eyes\nwide. Crimson was there on the sand. They were going to see Crimson.\nEven as she was thinking these horrible thoughts, one of the pirates saw\nCrimson and picked her up. Blackbeard came over and took the doll and\nlooked at her. At that moment there was a shout from above the cliffs\nand an arrow suddenly transfixed one of the pirates. He fell down\nwrithing and Blackbeard and the rest of his men raced back to the\nlongboat.\n\n\"Indians,\" Charlie whispered knowingly.\n\nThe Indians shouted and yelled.\n\n\"Are there any cowboys here?\" Robin asked hopefully.\n\n\"No, sir. No cowboys,\" Charlie said very definitely.\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" Robin said. \"I wish we had something.\"\n\nWith a little squeal of delight, she looked down at her feet. Two\nplatters of fried chicken, with all the trimmings. Her favorite. They\nate ravenously, not hearing the Indians any more. They watched the\nlongboat return to the pirate ship. All this way, they could see little\nCrimson's dress as Blackbeard took her aboard. Robin finished her fried\nchicken and started to cry.\n\n\"Girls,\" said Charlie in disgust.\n\n\"I can't help it. Poor Crimson.\"\n\n\"Is she dead?\"\n\n\"Blackbeard the pirate took her.\"\n\n\"Charles was my grandfather's name. My grandfather died and they named\nme Charles.\"\n\n\"I want Crimson!\"\n\n\"Get down! The Indians will see you.\"\n\n\"The Indians went away. I want Crimson!\"\n\n\"We could name this beach after Crimson.\"\n\n\"Aw, what do you know? It's only a beach.\"\n\n\"We could name the whole wide world.\" Charlie gestured expansively.\n\nThe green sand of the beach became crimson. The sky had a crimson glow.\n\n\"It sure is a funny world,\" Charlie said. Laughter loud as thunder\nechoed in the sky. \"A world called Crimson,\" he added.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tide came in. Spray and surf bounded off the rocks, wetting them.\n\"We better go up the hill,\" Robin said. By hill she meant the\nperpendicular cliffs behind them.\n\nThe tide thundered in. They were sodden. They clung to the rocks.\n\n\"We need an elevator or something,\" Charlie said.\n\nGolden cables flashed in the sunlight. The gilt elevator cage came down.\nThey climbed in as a big wave came and battered the rocks. The elevator\nwent up, up to the top of the cliff. They could see a long way across\nthe water. They could watch the pirate ship sailing away, the skull\nblack as night on its sail.\n\nThey got out of the elevator at the top of the cliff. They didn't see\nany Indians, but they saw the ashes of a campfire.\n\n\"Are there lions and tigers and everything?\" Robin asked in wonder,\ngazing out over the beach and the sea and then turning around to see the\ngreen forest which began fifty yards beyond the edge of the cliff.\n\n\"Sure there are lions and tigers,\" Charlie said matter-of-factly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOff somewhere in the woods, a big cat roared. Robin whimpered.\n\n\"I w-was only fooling,\" Charlie said, vaguely understanding that you\ncould somehow make things happen on this world called Crimson.\n\nBut he learned a lesson that night. You could make things happen on\nCrimson, but you couldn't unmake them.\n\nThe tiger roared again. But they were downwind from it and it went\nelsewhere in search of prey. Huddled together near the embers of the\nIndian campfire, the two children slept fitfully through the cold night.\n\nThen the three suns finally came up on three different sides of the\nhorizon. Crimson was deadly, but beautiful....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Although credit for the discovery of _Aladdin's Planet_ goes to the\nexplorer Richard Purcell of Earth, two Earth children actually were\nshipwrecked there twenty years before Purcell's expedition. But instead\nof paving the way for Purcell, they actually made the exploration more\ndifficult for him. In fact, it was positively fraught with peril. But\nsince _Aladdin's Planet_ had become the galaxy's arsenal of plenty, it\nwas well worth Purcell's effort. As any schoolboy knows in this utopia\nof 24th century plenty, _Aladdin's Planet_, almost exactly at the heart\nof the galaxy, where matter is spontaneously created to sweep out in\nlong cosmic trails across the galaxy, is the home not merely of\nspontaneous creation of matter, but spontaneous _formed_ creation, with\nany human psyche capable of doing the handwork of God. A planet of great\nimport ..._\n\n                                    _--from The ANNALS OF SPACE, Vol. 2_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stood poised for a glorious moment on the very edge of the rock, the\nbronze and pink of her glistening in the sun, the spray still clinging\nto her from her last dive. Then, grace in every line of her lithe body,\nshe sprang from the rock in a perfectly executed swan dive.\n\nCharlie helped her out, smiling. \"That was pretty,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, you taught me how.\" Her figure was not yet that of a woman, but\nfar more than that of a girl. She was very beautiful and Charlie knew\nthis although he had no standards to judge by, except for the Indian\nwomen they occasionally saw or Blackbeard's slave girls when the pirate\nship came in to trade.\n\nUnselfconsciously, Robin climbed into her gold-mesh shorts. Charlie\nhelped her fasten the gold-mesh halter. Long, long ago--it seemed an\nunreal dream, almost--he had been a very small boy and his mother had\ntaken him to a show in which everyone danced and sang and wore gold-mesh\nclothing. He had never forgotten it, and now all their clothing was\ngold-mesh.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRobin spun around and looked at him. Her tawny blonde hair fell almost\nto her waist, and he helped her comb it with a jewel-encrusted comb he\nhad wished into being a few days before.\n\n\"I so like Crimson!\" she cried impulsively.\n\nCharlie smiled. \"Why, that's a funny thing to say. Is there any other\nkind of a place?\"\n\n\"You mean, but Crimson?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I don't know. It is funny. Sometimes I think--\"\n\nCharlie smiled at her, a little condescendingly. \"Oh, it's the book\nagain, is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"All right. It's the book. Stop making fun of me.\"\n\nMany years ago, when they'd been small children, they had returned to\nthe ruined spaceship which had brought them to Crimson. It had been\nempty except for the book, as if the book had been placed there for them\nby whatever power had put them in the spaceship. Naturally, they had not\nbeen able to read, but they kept the book anyway. Then one day, years\nlater, Robin had wished to be able to read and the next time she lifted\nthe book and opened it, the magic of the words was miraculously revealed\nto her. The book was called A ONE VOLUME ENCYCLOPEDIC HISTORY and it\ntold about just everything--except Crimson. There was no mention of\nCrimson at all. Robin read the book over and over again until she almost\nknew it by heart. Even Charlie had listened to it twice all the way\nthrough when she read it, but he had never wished for the ability to\nread himself.\n\nNow Charlie asked: \"Do you really believe the book? This is Crimson.\nThis is real.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Sometimes I think this isn't as real as everything in the\nbook. And sometimes I just don't know.\"\n\nThey walked in silence to their elevator and took it to the top of the\nhighest cliff. They had wished for a house there, like one Robin had\nseen in the book. They had wished for many things to make their lives\ninteresting, or pleasant. They had peopled Crimson with the fruit of\ntheir wishes, using the ONE VOLUME ENCYCLOPEDIC HISTORY as a guide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey lived a mile from the Indian Camp. They traded with the Indians\nwho, strangely, did not know how to wish for things. Neither did the\npirates, or anyone. Just Robin and Charlie. The pirates lived across the\nsea on an island. To the south along the shore were Phoenicians, Greeks,\nMayas, Royal Navymen, Submariners, mermaids and Cyclopes. To the north\nalong the shore were Polynesians, Maoris, Panamanians and Dutchmen.\nInland were Cannibals, Lotus Eaters, a few settlements of cowboys to\nmake life interesting for the Indians, farmers, Russians, Congressmen\nand Ministers. All had been created by Robin and Charlie, who visited\nthem sometimes. They never believed for a minute that Robin and Charlie\nhad really created them, although all were amazed by Robin and Charlie's\nability to make things appear out of thin air.\n\nJust as they reached their house, an Indian brave came running down the\ntrail toward them.\n\n\"Skyship come!\" he cried, gesturing wildly and excitedly.\n\n\"Skyship?\" repeated Charlie, looking at Robin. \"Have you created any\nspaceships?\"\n\n\"No. You know it's a bargain between us. We don't create anything we\ndon't think we understand.\"\n\nThe Indian was sweating. His name was Tashtu, which meant Wild Eagle,\nand he was their go-between with the tribe. \"Skyship sweep across\nheavens,\" he said. \"Not land. Go up in Wild Country.\"\n\nCharlie's interest quickened. Wild Country. They had created it on\nimpulse, about twenty miles from the Indian Camp, midway between the\nsettlements of Congressmen inland and Cyclopes on the shore. It was a\nplace of tortuous gorges and rocks and mountains, utterly lifeless. No\none ever went there. Someday, he had always told Robin, they would\nexplore Wild Country. If there really was a spaceship, and if it had\ngone there ...\n\n\"No,\" Robin said. \"I know what you're thinking. But I'm perfectly happy\nhere.\"\n\n\"You just now said you sometimes thought Crimson wasn't real and there\nwere other, real worlds which--\"\n\n\"That's different. I can dream, can't I?\"\n\n\"But don't you see, if a spaceship's really come, maybe they can tell\nus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe gripped his arm. \"Charlie. Oh, Charlie, I don't know. I'm afraid.\nWe've been happy here, haven't we? We really wouldn't want it to\nchange ...\"\n\n\"I'm going to Wild Country,\" Charlie said stubbornly.\n\nTashtu nodded his head. \"It is good that you do. For the braves--\"\n\n\"Don't tell me they went after the skyship?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"Yes, Lord. Skyship come low, ruin crops mile around. War dance follow.\nWar party leave last sunrise.\"\n\n\"Six hours ago!\" Charlie cried. \"Can we overtake them?\"\n\nTashtu shrugged. \"Hurry, Lord.\"\n\n\"Don't you see,\" Charlie told Robin. \"They're savages. They wouldn't\nunderstand anything like spaceships. They wouldn't want to. If they get\nthe chance, they'll kill first and ask questions afterwards. We've got\nto go to the Wild Country now.\"\n\nBig and brawny Tashtu was nodding his head earnestly, but Robin seemed\nunconvinced. \"Why,\" she said, \"there isn't even anything about Wild\nCountry in the book.\"\n\n\"That's because we made it.\"\n\n\"And besides, the Congressmen are dangerous.\"\n\n\"Congressmen? Don't you mean the Cyclopes?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sorry. The Cyclopes are dangerous.\"\n\nShe couldn't possibly have meant the Congressmen. It was never clear to\neither of them precisely what a Congressman did. But there were hundreds\nof them on one side of Wild Country and they were forever making\nspeeches and promises, little round bald men with great, rich voices\nand wonderful vocabularies. Charlie loved to hear them speak.\n\n\"We go, Lord?\" Tashtu asked.\n\nCharlie nodded and went inside swiftly for his rifle. It was modeled\nafter the most powerful rifle in the encyclopedia and was called a\nMannlicher Elephant Gun. Robin came with her own smaller Springfield\nrepeater.\n\n\"Ready?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"Yes. We can think up food along the trail.\"\n\n\"Hurry, Lord,\" Tashtu urged.\n\nCharlie could hardly contain his excitement. The Wild Country, at last.\nAnd a spaceship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the time they were ready to make planetfall on the unexplored world,\nPurcell knew his dislike of Glaudot bordered on actual hatred. Purcell,\nwho was forty-five years old and a bachelor, liked his spacemen tough,\nyes: you had to be tough to land on, explore, and subdue a couple of\ndozen worlds, as Purcell himself had done. But he also liked his\nspacemen with humility: facing the unknown and sometimes the unknowable\nat every step of the way, you needed humility.\n\nGlaudot, younger than Purcell by fifteen years, confident, arrogant, a\nlean hard man and handsome in a gaunt-cheeked, saturnine way, lacked\nhumility. For one thing, he treated the crew like dirt and had treated\nthem that way since blastoff from Earth almost five months before. For\nanother, he seemed impatient with Purcell's orders, although Purcell was\nnot a cautious man, and certainly not a timid one. What had been growing\nbetween them flared out into the open moments before planetfall.\n\n\"I can't get over it,\" Purcell said. \"I've never seen a world anything\nlike it.\" They had made telescopic observations from within the\natmosphere. \"Giants living in caves,\" Purcell went on. \"Sailing ships\nflying the Jolly Roger. A town consisting of miniature replicas of the\nWhite House on Earth. Mermaids.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you really thought you saw mermaids?\" Glaudot asked a\nlittle condescendingly.\n\n\"All right, I'll admit I only caught a glimpse of them. I thought they\nwere mermaids. But what about the Indians?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Glaudot admitted. \"I saw the Indians.\"\n\nUsing their atmospheric rockets, they had flown over the Indian village\nat an altitude of only a few hundred feet, to see bronze-skinned men\nrush out of tents and stare up at them in awe. After that, Purcell had\ndecided to find some desolate spot in which to land, in order not to\nrisk a too-sudden encounter with any of the fantastically diversified\nnatives.\n\nNow Glaudot said: \"You're taking what we saw too literally, Captain.\nWhy, I remember on Harfonte we had all sorts of hallucinations until\nCaptain Jamison discovered they were exactly that--we'd been hypnotized\ninto seeing the things we most feared by powerless natives who really\nfeared us.\"\n\n\"This isn't Harfonte,\" Purcell said, a little irritably.\n\n\"Yeah, but you weren't there.\"\n\n\"I know that, Glaudot. I'm only trying to point out that each world must\nbe considered as unique. Each world presents its own problems, which--\"\n\n\"I say this is like Harfonte all over again. I say if you'd had the guts\nto land right smack in the middle of that Indian village, you'd have\nseen for yourself. I say to play it close to the vest is ridiculous,\"\nGlaudot said, and then smiled deprecatingly. \"Begging your pardon, of\ncourse, Captain. But don't you see, man, you've got to show the\nextraterrestrials, whatever form they take, that Earthmen aren't afraid\nof them.\"\n\n\"Caution and fear aren't the same thing,\" Purcell insisted. He didn't\nknow why he bothered to explain this to Glaudot. Perhaps it was because\nEnsign Chandler, youngest man in the exploration party, was in the\nlounge listening to them. Chandler was a nice kid, clean-cut and right\nout of the finest tradition of Earth, but Chandler was, like all boys\nbarely out of their teens, impressionable. He was particularly\nimpressionable in these, his first months in space.\n\n\"When you're cautious it's as much to protect the natives as yourself,\"\nPurcell went on, and then put into simple words what Glaudot and\nChandler should have learned at the Academy for Exploration, anyway.\n\nWhen he finished, Glaudot shrugged and asked: \"What do you think, Ensign\nChandler?\"\n\nChandler blushed slowly. \"I--I'd rather not say,\" he told them. \"Captain\nPurcell is--the captain.\"\n\nGlaudot smiled his triumph at Purcell. It was then, for the first time,\nthat Purcell's dislike for the man became intense. Purcell wondered how\nlong he'd been poisoning the youth's mind against the doctrines of the\nAcademy.\n\nJust then a light glowed in the bulkhead and a metallic voice intoned:\n\"Prepare for landing. Prepare for landing at once.\"\n\nPurcell, striding to his blast-hammock, told Glaudot, who was the\nexpedition's exec, \"I'll want the landing party ready to move half an\nhour after planetfall.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Glaudot eagerly. At least there was something they\nagreed on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Men,\" Purcell told the small landing party as they assembled near the\nmain airlock thirty-five minutes later, \"we have an obligation to our\ncivilization which I hope all of you understand. While here on this\nunknown world we must do nothing to bring discredit to the name of Earth\nand the galactic culture which Earth represents.\"\n\nThey had all seen the bleak moon-like landscape through the viewports.\nThey were eager to get out there and plant the flag of Earth and\ndetermine what the new world was like. There were only eight of them in\nthe first landing party: others would follow once the eight established\na preliminary base of operations. The eight were wearing the new-style,\nlight-weight spacesuits which all exploration parties used even though\nthe temperature and atmosphere of the new world seemed close enough to\nEarth-norm. It had long ago been decided at the Academy that chances\ncouldn't be taken with some unknown factor, possibly toxic, fatal and\nirreversible, in an unknown atmosphere. After a day or two of thorough\nlaboratory analysis of the air they'd be able to chuck their spacesuits\nif all went well.\n\nThey filed through the airlock silently, Purcell first with the flag of\nEarth, then Glaudot, then the others. White faces watched from the\nviewport as they clomped across the convoluted terrain.\n\n\"Nobody here but us chickens!\" Glaudot said, and he laughed, after they\nhad walked some way across the desolate landscape. \"But then, what did\nyou expect? Captain took us clear of all the more promising places.\"\n\nThe man's only motive, Purcell decided, was his colossal ego. He made no\nreply: that would be descending to Glaudot's level.\n\nAfter they walked almost entirely across the low-walled crater in which\nthe exploration ship had come down, and after Purcell had planted the\nflag on the highest pinnacle within the low crater walls, Glaudot said:\n\n\"How's about taking a look-see over the top, Captain? At least that\nmuch.\"\n\nPurcell wasn't in favor of the idea. It would mean leaving sight of the\nship too soon. But the radio voices of most of the men indicated that\nthey agreed with Glaudot, so Purcell shrugged and said a pair of\nvolunteers could go, if they promised to rejoin the main party within\ntwo hours.\n\nGlaudot immediately volunteered. That at least made sense. Glaudot had\nthe courage of his convictions. Several others volunteered, but the\nfirst hand up had been Ensign Chandler's.\n\n\"I don't want to sound like a martinet,\" Purcell told them. \"But you\nunderstand that by two hours I mean two hours. Not a minute more.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Chandler said.\n\n\"Glaudot?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the Executive Officer replied.\n\n\"All right,\" Purcell said. He walked over to the first of the big\nmagna-sleds piled high with equipment. \"We'll be setting up the base\ncamp over here. I know the men still in the ship will want to stretch\ntheir legs soon as possible. We don't want to have to go looking for\nyou, Glaudot.\"\n\n\"Not me, Captain,\" Glaudot assured him, and walked off toward the crater\nrim with young Ensign Chandler.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What the devil was that?\" Chandler said forty-five minutes later.\n\n\"Stop jumping at every shadow you see. Relax.\"\n\n\"I thought I saw something moving behind that rock.\"\n\n\"So, go take a look.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Hell, boy, don't let that Purcell put the fear of the unknown into you\non your very first trip out. Huh, what do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, Mr. Glaudot,\" Ensign Chandler replied.\n\n\"After all,\" Glaudot went on, \"we have nothing to be afraid of. We're\nstill within sight of the ship.\"\n\nChandler turned around. \"I don't see it,\" he said.\n\n\"From the top of that rock you could.\"\n\n\"Think so?\"\n\n\"Sure I do. Why don't you take a look if it will make you feel better?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Chandler said, and smiled at his own temerity. But he knew\nvaguely that he'd been caught in a crossfire between the cautious\nPurcell and the bold, arrogant Glaudot. Sometimes he really thought that\nthe Captain's caution made sense: on Wulcreston, he'd learned at the\nAcademy, a whole Earth expedition had been slaughtered before contact\nbecause the natives mistook hand telescopes for weapons. And surely on\nany world a spacesuited man looked more like a monster than a man\nalthough he was vulnerable in a spacesuit, even more vulnerable than a\nnaked man because he could only run awkwardly.\n\nAll this Chandler thought as he climbed the high rock rampart. He'd send\na subspace letter back to the folks tonight, sure enough, he told\nhimself. Not only had he been chosen for the preliminary exploration\nparty, he'd made the first trip out of sight of the spaceship. It\ncertainly was something to write home about, and Mom would be very\nproud ...\n\nHe was on top of the rock now. The vast tortuous landscape spread out\nbelow him like a relief map in a mapmaker's nightmare. Far to his left,\nbeyond Glaudot's spacesuited figure, he could see the projectile-shaped\nspaceship resting on its tail fins. And to his right--\n\nHe stared. He gawked.\n\nAt the last moment he tried to get down from the rock, but his spaceboot\ncaught on an outcropping and his fatal mistake was standing upright in\nan attempt to free it.\n\nThen all at once in a blinding burst of pain he was clutching at\nsomething in his chest but knew as his life ebbed rapidly from his young\nbody that it would not matter if he was able to pull the cruel shaft\nout....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlaudot went rushing up the side of the rock. He still couldn't believe\nhis eyes. Ensign Chandler had been impaled by two long feathered shafts,\ntwo arrows. The force of the first one had spun Chandler around and he\nlay now with his back arched across the topmost ramparts of the rock,\ntwo arrows protruding from his chest and his life blood, starkly crimson\nagainst the white of the spacesuit, pouring out.\n\nReaching the top of the rock in an attempt to drag the dying boy down,\nGlaudot saw the Indians rushing up the other side of the crater wall.\nIndians, he thought incredulously. Indians, as in the American West\nhundreds of years ago. Indians ... But just what the hell were they\ndoing here?\n\nA muscular brave notched an arrow, his right hand drawing the feathered\nshaft back to his ear. Quickly Glaudot flung his arms skyward, hoping\nthat the universal gesture of surrender would be understood. The brave\nstood statue-still. His lips opened. He was speaking to another of the\nhalf-dozen Indians in the raiding band, but Glaudot could not hear the\nwords through his space helmet. He knew his life hung in the balance.\n\nHe watched, fascinated and helpless, as the Indian who had slain Ensign\nChandler came toward him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTashtu said: \"Two raiding bands, Lord. One go north. Other south. We\nfollow?\"\n\nThey had reached the advance Indian camp on the fringe of the Wild\nCountry. So far they had seen nothing of the Cyclopes who lived in this\npart of the world. Of all their creations, Charlie and Robin feared and\navoided only the Cyclopes, the enormous one-eyed giants which had so\nintrigued Robin in the encyclopedia that she'd had a compulsion to\ncreate them, and had done so.\n\n\"We can't follow both bands,\" Charlie said, looking troubled.\n\n\"Why can't we?\" Robin asked. \"You go north with some of the braves,\nCharlie. I'll go south. We ought to be able to overtake the raiding\nparties before anything happens.\"\n\n\"I can't let you go alone.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll take Tashtu with me. Don't you think Tashtu can take\ncare of me as well as you can?\"\n\n\"Well, I just don't like the idea--\" Charlie began.\n\n\"That's silly. If we have to find them before there's trouble, we have\nto find them. Well, don't we?\"\n\nCharlie gave her an uncertain nod. He had grown up with her and had seen\nher every day of his life, but every time he took a good look at her, at\nthe lovely face and the tawny, long-limbed form ill-concealed by the\ngold-mesh garments, it took his breath away. Although in a sense a whole\nworld was his plaything, he had never seen anything so lovely. Finally\nhe said, \"I guess you're too logical for me. Take care of her, Tashtu.\"\n\n\"With my life, Lord,\" the Indian vowed as the group broke up. Robin ran\nto Charlie and hugged him, kissing his cheek half playfully, half in\nearnest.\n\n\"You be careful, too,\" she said, and went off with Tashtu and several of\nthe braves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaturally she was excited. She knew more about spacemen than Charlie\ndid. She had read the encyclopedia more carefully, hadn't she? She\nwondered what the spacemen would be like. She couldn't help wondering it\nbecause the only man she had ever known, except for those they had\ncreated, was Charlie. Of course, she hadn't told Charlie this in so many\nwords, but she felt, had always felt, vaguely and now felt clearly, that\nbefore she could settle down contentedly with Charlie, she would have to\nknow something of the world beyond Crimson. And there was a vast\nworld--a multitude of worlds--beyond Crimson. She knew that. The\nencyclopedia mentioned all of them but did not mention Crimson at all.\n\nThey walked for several minutes through green forest, and then abruptly\ncame to the edge of the Wild Country. Even the idea of the Wild Country\nbrought an eagerness to Robin's limbs and made her walk more rapidly.\nThe Wild Country was unknown, wasn't it? They had created it without\nknowing quite what they were creating, and had never explored it.\n\nShe went ahead with Tashtu over the rocks and crushed pumice. No winds\nblew in Wild Country. The air was neither hot nor cold. The landscape\nseemed changeless and eternal, as if it had been that way since before\nthe dawn of history, although actually Charlie and Robin had created it\nonly a few years before.\n\nThey forged on for two hours, Tashtu following the easily read spoor in\nthe pumice. They came at last to a low crater wall, where the spoor\ndisappeared. At first Tashtu was confused, but then he pointed to the\ntop, several hundred feet above their heads. Robin caught a glimpse of\ntawny skin and feathers and buckskin in the sunlight.\n\n\"Haloo!\" Tashtu called, and some of the braves above them whirled, all\nspeaking excitedly in the clumsy English which was the only tongue they\nknew.\n\n\"Huragpha slay monster,\" they said. \"Capture other monster. But then\nsee ...\" the words drifted off into silence. Obviously, the Indians were\nperplexed. \"You come, see. Monster, him bleed like man.\"\n\nAt Tashtu's side, Robin rushed up the steep rocky slope. When they\nreached the top, breathless and all but exhausted, Robin put her hand to\nher mouth with a little cry of horror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a dead man stretched out on the rock there, two arrows\ntransfixing his chest through the fabric of his spacesuit. The spacesuit\nhad probably frightened the Indians, but he was a man all right. Had\nthey been closer, even the Indians would have known that. That poor\nman.... Why, he was hardly more than a boy.\n\nSpacemen!\n\nAnd there was another, surrounded now by several of the Indians. \"Him\nprisoner,\" said the Indian called Huragpha a little uncertainly.\n\nRobin walked over to the man in the spacesuit. He was a big man, even\nbigger than Charlie. He looked very strong, but the spacesuit might have\nbeen deceptive. He looked frightened, but not terrified.\n\n\"Are you really a spaceman?\" Robin asked.\n\nGlaudot said: \"Well, so one of you can speak more than a few grunts.\nThat's something.\" He looked carefully at Robin. \"Beautiful, too,\" he\nsaid. The way he said it was not a compliment. It was an objective\nstatement of fact.\n\n\"I know it won't help to say I'm sorry about your friend. Words won't\nhelp, I guess. But--\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Glaudot said. \"All right. He's dead. I can't bring him back and\nyou can't bring him back, sister.\"\n\n\"I'm not your sister,\" Robin said.\n\nGlaudot told her it was a way of speaking. He couldn't quite believe his\nears. She spoke English as well as he did, which was incredible enough\nhere on a world halfway across the galaxy. But he got the impression\nthat she was almost fantastically naive. Yet the Indians--and,\nincredibly, they were Indians--seemed to be subservient to her, almost\nseemed to worship her.\n\nGlaudot sat down on his space helmet, which he had taken off some\nminutes before, and said: \"Are you the boss lady around here?\"\n\n\"Boss lady? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Are you in charge? Do you run things?\"\n\nRobin smiled and said: \"I created them.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. Now _I_ don't get _you_.\"\n\n\"I said I created them. It's very simple. My friend and I decided a very\nlong time ago it would be nice or interesting or I forget what, it was\nso long ago, if we had some Indians. So, we created Indians.\"\n\nGlaudot threw his head back and laughed. \"For a minute,\" he said, \"you\nalmost had me believing you.\" The girl was dressed like a savage, he\ntold himself, like a beautiful savage, but at least she had a sense of\nhumor. That was something.\n\n\"But what is so funny?\" Robin asked.\n\n\"You just now said--\"\n\n\"I know what I said. My friend and I created the Indians. Of course.\nWhy? Can't you create anything you want? Just anything?\"\n\n\"All right, sister,\" Glaudot said a little angrily. He did not like\nbeing made fun of, for he lacked the capacity to laugh at himself. \"Just\nhow much of a fool do you think I am?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know,\" Robin replied. \"How much of a fool are you?\"\n\nGlaudot glared at her. Purcell was going to be one mad captain when he\nwas told of Chandler's death, but men had died on expeditions before and\nit really wasn't Glaudot's fault. At any rate he had established contact\nwith somebody of obvious importance among the natives, and Purcell would\nappreciate that.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Glaudot said.\n\n\"Tell me about being a spaceman. Do you really fly among the stars?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" Glaudot said, \"although it isn't really flying.\"\n\n\"And do you create new stars as you go along?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere she went again with her talk of creation, as if creating things\nout of nothing was the commonest occurrence in the world. Glaudot stood\nup. \"All right, sister. Show me.\"\n\n\"Why, show you what?\"\n\n\"Create something.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Robin said, disappointed, \"you actually can't?\"\n\n\"Just go ahead and create something.\"\n\nRobin shrugged. \"What would you like?\"\n\nGlaudot thought for a moment. \"A piano!\" he said suddenly. \"How about a\npiano?\" It was complicated enough, he thought. \"And while you're at it,\nhow about telling me how come everyone speaks English--or tries to speak\nEnglish around here?\"\n\nRobin frowned. \"Is there some other way of speaking?\"\n\nGlaudot also frowned. That line of thought wouldn't get him anywhere.\n\"O.K.,\" he said. \"One piano coming up?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Robin said.\n\nGlaudot blinked. The pretty girl hadn't moved. She hadn't even changed\nher facial expression. But a parlor grand piano stood on the rock before\nthem.\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" Glaudot said. \"What else can you create?\"\n\n\"We made all the natives here. We made the green and crimson. We made\nthis whole Wild Country. We made some of the animals too.\"\n\n\"Like--the piano? Out of nothing?\"\n\n\"Is there another way?\"\n\nGlaudot said, \"You better come back to the ship with me. Captain'll like\nto see you.\"\n\nTashtu shook his head. \"The Lady Robin awaits the Lord.\"\n\nGlaudot looked at Robin. \"Who's that?\"\n\n\"Charlie. He's just my friend. I--I don't think I have to wait for him.\nI've always been more interested in reading about spacemen than he has.\nI'll go with you now if you want.\"\n\nTashtu looked unhappy. \"Lord Charlie, he say--\"\n\n\"Well, you wait right here, Tashtu, and tell Charlie where I've gone.\nWhat could be simpler? I'll be all right, don't worry about me.\"\n\n\"Lord Charlie, he say watch you.\"\n\n\"And I say I'm going with the spaceman to his spaceship.\"\n\nTashtu bowed. \"The Lady has spoken,\" he said, and watched Robin descend\nthe rocky rampart and walk back with Glaudot toward the far distant\nglint of metal which was this spaceship they were talking about.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So you can create just anything,\" Glaudot said.\n\n\"I guess so.\"\n\nA goddess, he thought. A beautiful goddess who ...\n\nSuddenly he stared at her. Who could make him the most powerful man in\nthe galaxy.\n\n\"This spaceship of yours--\" she began.\n\n\"Wait. Wait a minute. If you can create anything, how's about\nre-creating Chandler?\"\n\n\"Chand-ler? What is Chand-ler?\"\n\n\"The boy back there. The one your braves killed.\"\n\nRobin said: \"If you wish,\" and Glaudot held his breath. The power over\nlife and death, he thought....\n\nHe looked down and saw Chandler's spacesuited body there, the two arrows\nprotruding from his chest. He shook his head. \"Not dead,\" he said. \"What\ngood is he to anybody dead?\"\n\nRobin nodded. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I just hadn't thought before of\nbringing people back to life. It ... why it seems ...\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't really be bringing him back, you know. It would be a copy,\njust a copy.\"\n\n\"But a perfect copy?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Then if it's just a copy it shouldn't bother you at all, should it?\"\n\n\"Well ...\" Robin said doubtfully.\n\n\"Go ahead. Show me you can do it.\"\n\nGlaudot gaped. Another figure sat alongside Chandler's corpse,\nChandler's second corpse. The other figure got up. It was Chandler.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Look out!\" the new Chandler cried. \"Look out--Indians!\"\n\n\"Just take it easy,\" Glaudot told him. Glaudot's face was very white,\nhis eyes big and round and staring.\n\nChandler looked down at the body on the rocks. His knees buckled and\nGlaudot caught him, stopping him from falling. Chandler tried to say\nsomething, but the words wouldn't come. He stared with horrified\nfascination at the body, which was an exact copy of himself--or a copy\nof the dead man from whom the new living man was copied.\n\n\"May we go to your spaceship now?\" Robin asked Glaudot politely. \"I have\nalways wished to see a spaceship.\"\n\nHere was power, Glaudot thought. Incredible power. All the power to\ncontrol worlds, to carve worlds from primordial slime, almost, for\nyourself. Here was far more power than any man in the galaxy had ever\nbeen offered. Was it his, Glaudot's?\n\nIt wouldn't be if he brought the beautiful girl to the spaceship and\nPurcell. For Captain Purcell, a devoted servant of the galactic\ncivilization which he was attempting to spread to the outworlds, would\nthink in terms of what good the discovery of this girl could bring to\nall humanity. But if Glaudot kept her to himself ...\n\nAnd then another thought almost stunned him. Why merely the girl? She'd\nmentioned a friend, hadn't she? Perhaps it was something in the\natmosphere of this strange world, in the very air you breathed. Perhaps\nanyone could do it, could create out of nothing--Glaudot included.\n\n\"You want to go to the spaceship?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"Then teach me the secret of creation.\"\n\n\"Of making things, you mean? Why, there isn't any secret. Should there\nbe any secret? You merely--create.\"\n\n\"Show me,\" said Glaudot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA table appeared, and savory dishes of food.\n\n\"Magician!\" cried Chandler.\n\nA great roan stallion, bridled but without a saddle, materialized. Robin\nswung up on its broad back and used her bare knees for balance and\ncontrol. The stallion cantered off.\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Glaudot. \"Please wait.\"\n\nThe stallion cantered back and Robin alighted. The stallion began to\ngraze on a patch of grass which suddenly appeared on the naked rock. The\nstallion seemed quite content.\n\n\"You mean,\" the new Chandler asked in an awed voice, \"she just _made_\nthese things? The food. The table. The horse ...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Glaudot. He concentrated his will on creating a single\nflower in the new field of grass. He concentrated his whole being.\n\nBut nothing happened.\n\nHe glared almost angrily at Robin, as if it were her fault. \"I don't\nhave the power you have,\" he said.\n\nShe nodded. \"Only Charlie and me.\" She looked at the roan stallion.\n\"Beauty, isn't he? I'll present him to Charlie.\" She turned to Glaudot.\n\"Now take me to the ship.\"\n\n\"We ought to get started back there, Mr. Glaudot,\" Chandler said.\n\n\"Yes? Why?\"\n\n\"But--but I don't have to tell you why! This girl is one of the most\nimportant discoveries that has ever been made. The ability to create\nmaterial things ... out of nothing....\"\n\n\"Show me your planet,\" Glaudot told Robin, ignoring the younger man. \"We\ncan talk about the spaceship later. You see, I'm an explorer and it's\nmy job to explore new worlds.\" He spoke slowly, simply, as he would\nspeak to a child. Somehow, although the girl was not a child and was\nquite the most astonishingly beautiful girl he had ever seen, he thought\nthat was the right approach.\n\n\"Now wait a minute, Mr. Glaudot,\" Chandler protested. \"We both know it's\nour duty to bring her to Captain Purcell.\"\n\n\"Maybe you think it's your duty,\" Glaudot told the younger man. \"I don't\nthink it's mine. And before you run off to the ship to tell that\nprecious captain of yours, you ought to know that you'd be dead right\nnow if it hadn't been for me.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Hell, yes. Those Indians or whatever they were killed you. I asked the\ngirl to bring you back to life.\"\n\n\"To bring--\" echoed Chandler his mouth falling open.\n\n\"Actually, she produced a perfect copy of you. A living copy. Do you see\nwhat she offers us, Chandler? Infinite wealth from creativity out of\nnothing--and eternal life by copying our bodies each time we die! What\ndo you say about your precious captain now?\"\n\nChandler seemed confused. He shook his head, staring first at Glaudot\nand then at Robin. \"The ship,\" he said. \"Our duty ... the captain ...\"\n\nGlaudot snorted and told Robin: \"Kill him.\"\n\n\"Kill him?\"\n\n\"Yes. You brought him into being. Now send him out of being.\"\n\n\"But I can't do that. I have no further control once I make something.\nAnd besides I--I wouldn't kill a human being, even if I could.\"\n\nFear was in Chandler's eyes. \"Mr. Glaudot, listen ...\" he began.\n\n\"Listen, hell,\" Glaudot said. \"I brought you back to life. I offered you\na share in the greatest power the worlds have ever known. You turned it\ndown. I'm sorry, Chandler. I'm really sorry for you. But I can't let you\nreturn to the ship, you see. Not until I learn some more about this\nworld, not until I understand exactly what the girl's power is, and\nconsolidate my position.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout waiting to hear more, Chandler began to run. In three great\nbounds he reached the grazing roan stallion and leaped on its back,\ndigging his heels into its flanks. The stallion moved off at a quick\ntrot as Glaudot drew his blaster and took dead aim at Chandler's\nretreating back.\n\nWhen he had Chandler squarely in his sights, Glaudot began to squeeze\nthe trigger. But suddenly the trigger-housing-unit of the blaster became\nencumbered with tiny vines. There were hundreds of them writhing and\ncrawling all over the weapon and getting in the sights too so Glaudot\ncould no longer aim. By the time he tore the vines clear, cursing\nsavagely, the roan stallion had taken Chandler out of sight on his\nretreat toward the spaceship.\n\nGlaudot whirled on Robin. \"You did this!\" he accused her. \"You did it.\nWhy--why?\"\n\n\"You were going to kill him. You shouldn't have.\"\n\n\"But now you've ruined everything. Not just for me. For us, don't you\nsee? I could have laid the world at your feet. I could have--listen!\nTell me this--is there any place we can hide? Some place they won't find\nus if they come looking, while we work on this power of yours and see\nexactly what it can do and what it can't do?\"\n\n\"I want to see the spaceship, please,\" said Robin.\n\n\"Afterwards, I promise you,\" Glaudot said. \"Why, we can make all the\nspaceships we want--out of nothing. Can't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Robin. \"I guess so. But even if we hide from your friends,\nmy friend Charlie will find us. He'll be worried about me and he'll find\nus. Charlie can do everything I can do, you see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlaudot stared at her with anger in his eyes. Then something else\nreplaced the anger. No, he thought, Charlie couldn't do everything she\ncould do. She was beautiful. Her half-nude body summoned desire in him.\nTentatively, ready to withdraw his hand at the first indication of\nprotest, he touched her bare shoulder. She made no response. She merely\nstood there, waiting for some kind of an answer from him.\n\n\"Then we'll have to hide from Charlie too. Please believe me,\" Glaudot\nsaid. \"I'm a spaceman and you know very little about spacemen. Do you\nwant to learn?\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Then take me some place even Charlie will have difficulty finding us.\"\n\n\"But he'll know.\"\n\n\"What do you mean he'll know? Don't tell me you can read one another's\nminds?\"\n\n\"Oh, goodness, no. Nothing like that. But when we were very little I\nonce told Charlie if ever I got mad at him I would go to hide in the\ncountry of the Cyclopes and he would never be able to find me because\nthe Cyclopes would eat him. That was after we read about the Cyclopes in\nthe Ulysses story in our encyclopedia. You see?\"\n\n\"Cyclopes, huh? You really mean one-eyed giants?\"\n\n\"Yes. We made them but they don't obey us.\"\n\n\"Can the two of us hide in their land? Is it far?\"\n\n\"No. Very close. But I don't know if I want--\"\n\n\"I'm a spaceman, aren't I? And you want to learn all about spacemen and\nthe worlds beyond this place, don't you? Then come with me!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"If you say no and I go back to the spaceship we'll blast off and you'll\nnever see spacemen again the rest of your life,\" threatened Glaudot.\n\nRobin did not answer. \"Well?\" Glaudot snapped, as if he was quite\nindifferent. \"Would you want that to happen?\"\n\n\"No,\" Robin admitted after a while.\n\n\"Then let's go.\" They had to hurry, Glaudot knew. Riding that stallion,\nthat incredible conjured-out-of-nothing stallion, Chandler had probably\nreached the spaceship by now. A few words, a few hurried explanations,\nand Purcell would lead an armed party out after Glaudot.\n\nAgain Robin was silent. Glaudot stood stiffly in front of her, so close\nhe could reach out and wrap his arms about her. But this wasn't the\ntime, he told himself. Later ... later ...\n\n\"All right,\" Robin said at last, her eyes looking troubled. \"I'll take\nyou to the land of Cyclopes.\"\n\nThey began to walk, in silence. Half an hour later, the barren terrain\nof rocks gave way to a verdant jungle in which the trees were quite the\nbiggest Glaudot had ever seen and in which even the grass and the\nfragrant wild flowers grew over their heads. Glaudot had never felt so\nsmall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Wait a minute, Chandler,\" Captain Purcell said. \"I listened in silence\nto what you said. All of it, as incredible as it sounded. But you don't\nexpect me to believe--\"\n\n\"Look at the horse. Where did I get the horse, sir?\"\n\n\"So there are horses on this world. So what?\"\n\n\"But I saw the girl create it out of thin air!\"\n\n\"Really, Chandler.\"\n\n\"And I saw the corpse. My corpse, Captain. Mine!\"\n\n\"But hell, man. Glaudot would have come back here with the girl. He\nknows his obligation to civilization. He--\"\n\n\"Glaudot, sir? Does he?\"\n\nPurcell scowled and said finally: \"Chandler, either you and Glaudot have\nmade the most astonishing discovery since man first domesticated his\nenvironment and so became more than a reasonably clever animal, or\nyou're the biggest liar that ever crossed deep space.\"\n\nChandler offered his captain a pale smile. \"Why don't you find out\nwhich, sir?\"\n\n\"By God,\" said Purcell, \"I will. McCreedy!\" he bawled over the intercom.\n\"Smith! Wong! I want an armed expedition of twenty-five men ready to\nleave the ship in half an hour.\"\n\nAnd, exactly half an hour later, the expedition set out with Captain\nPurcell and Chandler leading it. Chandler went astride the roan\nstallion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Charlie and his small Indian band learned that the action had taken\nplace to the south, where Robin had gone, they set out quickly in that\ndirection. The further they went, the more worried Charlie became. If\nRobin had met with any kind of success, if she had called off the war\nparty and established some kind of peaceful relations with the spacemen,\na runner would have been sent to tell them. But the desolate rock-strewn\nterrain stretched out before them as devoid of life as the Paleozoic\nEarth.\n\nCharlie urged his men on relentlessly. He was a tireless hiker and since\nthe braves lived by hunting they could match almost any pace he set.\nFinally Charlie saw the second Indian band ahead of them. Slinging the\nMannlicher Elephant Gun, he began to run.\n\n\"Tashtu!\" he called. \"Tashtu!\"\n\nThe Indian sprinted to him. \"Lord,\" he said breathlessly, \"one sky\ncritter, him die. Turn out man.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Charlie asked.\n\nTashtu led him to the group of braves which still clustered about Ensign\nChandler's body. \"Why?\" Charlie demanded, horror-struck. \"Why?\"\n\nTashtu told him all that had happened. How the braves had mistaken the\nspacesuited man for a monster. How arrows had been fired before they had\nlearned otherwise. How Robin had come, and gone off with the spaceman.\n\n\"To their spaceship?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"Yes, Lord. That is what they spoke of.\" Tashtu pointed to the top of\nthe rampart of rock. \"From there, Lord, you can see it.\"\n\nCharlie scrambled up the rock. From his giddy perch on top he could see\nthe tiny silver gleam of the spaceship--and a band of men, led by a man\non horseback, approaching them. Charlie hurried down the rock, half\nclimbing, half sliding. \"They are coming,\" he said. \"Maybe Robin's with\nthem.\" He remembered what had happened last time and said: \"The rest of\nyou return to your homes. Tashtu and I will go on ahead.\"\n\n\"But Lord--\" Tashtu began.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I did not like the man. I did not trust him.\"\n\n\"Then why did you let Robin go?\"\n\n\"Let her, Lord? But surely Robin, the Lady Robin, does not obey a\nmere--\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Charlie said. \"But all the more reason for the\nrest of the braves to return to their homes. We can handle this, Tashtu,\nyou and I. I don't want any more killing.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lord,\" said Tashtu.\n\nThe Indians formed a marching column and moved off. Charlie told Tashtu\nwhat he had seen from the top of the rampart. Then he added: \"Let's go\nand meet them.\"\n\nAnd Charlie and Tashtu set out across the tortuous Wild Country.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Two men coming!\" Chandler cried, reining up the roan stallion.\n\nCaptain Purcell signaled his twenty-five men to halt, and their orderly\ndouble file came up short behind him. Pretty soon the two figures could\nbe seen by all, advancing toward them across the rocks. When they were\nclose enough, Captain Purcell hailed: \"We come in peace!\"\n\n\"And in peace we come!\" Charlie called. A moment later he was shaking\nhands gravely with Captain Purcell.\n\n\"Tell the captain about--about my corpse,\" Chandler told Tashtu.\n\nCharlie looked at Chandler. He had seen the dead man. \"Did Robin make\nyou?\" he asked in surprise. \"We never brought the dead to life before.\"\n\n\"Can you really do it?\" Purcell demanded.\n\n\"No, not really. But we can copy perfectly--and the copies live.\"\n\n\"You see?\" Chandler demanded triumphantly.\n\nCaptain Purcell said: \"Show me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharlie created a brother to the roan stallion. Captain Purcell gawked.\nThe one example sufficed and he did not ask for more as Glaudot had\ndone.\n\n\"Where's Robin?\" Charlie asked. \"At the ship?\"\n\nChandler shook his head. \"Glaudot went off with her.\"\n\n\"But I thought he was on the ship!\"\n\n\"He deserted,\" Chandler said. \"With the girl. He wants her. He wants her\npower for himself.\"\n\nCharlie moved very quickly. He swung in front of Chandler and grabbed\nhis tunic-front, bunching it, ripping it and all but dragging Chandler\nclear off his feet before a hand could be raised to stop him. \"Where did\nthey go?\" he asked in a terrible voice. \"Where are they? Take me to\nthem.\"\n\n\"But I don't--don't know!\" Chandler protested, trying without success to\nbreak free.\n\nIt was Captain Purcell who came forward and firmly took Charlie's arm,\npulling him clear of Chandler. \"Remember,\" he said. \"In peace. In\npeace.\"\n\nCharlie stood with his hands at his sides. His face was white and\nstrained. \"The girl,\" he said.\n\n\"We all want to find out where Glaudot took her,\" Captain Purcell said.\n\"We're going to help you. Tell me: could the girl have gone willingly\nwith Glaudot? To share his mad dream of power, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Robin?\" Charlie cried. \"Never!\"\n\n\"Please, lad,\" Captain Purcell said. \"I want you to think. I want you to\nconsider everything. You and this girl of yours may have almost godlike\npowers, but you've spent your lives on an uncivilized world and\nwell--frankly--couldn't a sophisticated man like Glaudot turn the girl's\nhead? Couldn't he confuse her into going off with him, at least\ntemporarily? And, assuming, he did, he doesn't know this world. He's\naware of that. He'd know we'd be coming after him. Perhaps the girl\nwould tell him about you. Tell me, man--where would the girl go if she\ndidn't want you to find her? Is there such a place? Before you answer, I\nwant you to know that what we do here may be far graver than you think.\nIt is not merely the safety of one girl we have to consider--but no, you\nwouldn't understand ...\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Charlie asked, \"if this man Glaudot somehow convinces Robin\nto use her power as he tells her, he might want to take over all of\nCrimson?\"\n\n\"Do you mean this world? Is it called Crimson? Yes--and more than that.\nThere's no telling how far a man like Glaudot could go with such power.\nAnd with the ability to create all the armament and all the deadly\nweapons he needed, and all the missiles to carry those weapons, he might\nchallenge the entire galaxy--and win!\"\n\nThe words were strange to Charlie. He only understood them vaguely. Now\nRobin, she would understand, he thought. Robin was always more\ninterested in things like that, Robin who almost knew their encyclopedia\nby heart, Robin ...\n\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"Listen. We created all the life on this world. We\nmade Greeks and Royal Navymen and Ministers and Russians and Congressmen\nand everything we knew or somehow had heard about or had read in our\nbook. We get along fine with all of them, except ...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Captain Purcell prompted. \"Go on, go on!\"\n\n\"No, she'd never go there. She was always afraid of them.\"\n\n\"Where, man? Where?\"\n\n\"No. Robin wouldn't. She just wouldn't.\"\n\nIt was not hot in Wild Country, but sweat trickled down Purcell's face\nwhile he waited for Charlie's answer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Show me!\" cried Glaudot in rapture. \"Show me! Show me! Show me!\"\n\nHe stood with Robin in a little glade in the Land of the Cyclopes. About\nthem were heaped all the treasures Glaudot had suddenly demanded. He did\nnot quite know why. He felt his iron control slipping and permitted it\nto slip now, for once he got this wild desire from his system, he knew\nonly his untroubled iron will would be left, and with it--and the\ngirl--he might conquer the galaxy.\n\nHeaped about them were jewels and precious metals and deadly weapons,\nall of which Robin had summoned into being at Glaudot's orders, while\nGlaudot smiled at her. It was almost a frightening smile. She was even a\nlittle sorry she had come away with him, but she could always go back,\ncouldn't she? She wasn't shackled to this strange man from space, was\nshe? And the way he looked at her, the desire she saw in his eyes, that\nwas frightening too. She did not know how to cope with it. Oh, she could\ncreate a duplicate Charlie, for example. Charlie would know what to do.\nCharlie would help her. Charlie hadn't read the book as she had read it,\nbut Charlie was more practical. Still, what would they do with the\nduplicate Charlie afterwards? You couldn't uncreate something ...\n\n\"A spaceship,\" Glaudot said suddenly. \"Can you create a spaceship out of\nnothing?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRobin nodded slowly. \"I can. Yes, I can. It tells all about spaceships\nin the book. But I don't know if I want to.\"\n\nGlaudot let it pass. There was no hurry. He was thinking about the\nfuture, though. If Purcell opposed him, as Purcell would, and managed\nto escape in the exploration ship, Glaudot would need a ship to leave\nthis world ...\n\n\"Why not?\" he asked, his voice quite calm now, the mania which had\nseized him under control now, and only his iron purpose motivating him.\n\n\"I--I don't know. You have one spaceship. I guess that's why. What do\nyou need another one for?\"\n\n\"It was just a thought,\" said Glaudot. \"It doesn't matter.\" He kneeled\nnear the heaps of sun-dazzled jewels. He let them trickle through his\nfingers. No, the desire wasn't gone yet. It was still fighting with his\nwill. And, since he knew his will could win at any time, it pleased him\nto give his desire free rein.\n\nHe scooped up a handful of jewels. He found a necklace and came close to\nRobin and dropped it over her head. The pearls were very white against\nher sun-tanned skin. The pearl pendant hung almost to the start of the\ndusky valley which cleaved her breasts delightfully and disappeared with\nthe tanned swell of flesh on either side into the gold-mesh halter.\nGlaudot fingered the pendant. His fingers touched flesh. Abruptly he\ndrew the surprised Robin to him and kissed her lips hungrily.\n\nFor a moment she remained passive. She neither returned his ardor nor\nfought it. But when his hands began to stroke her back she pulled away\nfrom him and stood there looking at him. She took the necklace off and\nthrew it at his feet.\n\n\"I don't want that any more,\" she said. \"Why did you do--what you did?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe felt the fire in his veins. He willed it to subside. He needed his\ncontrol now. All of it. But this girl, in the full flower of her youth\n... No, she was not a girl, not to Glaudot. He must not think of her as\na girl. She was power. Power. The power was his--if he didn't alienate\nthe girl.\n\n\"We do such as that on my world,\" he said. \"It is a kind of homage to\nloveliness. I hope you didn't mind.\"\n\n\"I--it was strange. With Charlie sometimes I hope--but with Charlie it\nis ... different. Please don't touch me again. Please promise me that.\"\n\nGlaudot shrugged. \"If you wish, my dear child, if you wish....\"\n\nThe dual desire was gone now, truly gone. He knew that. For his will had\nbeen threatened, more by his own foolish desire than by this innocent\ngirl. He had to think. Clearly. More clearly than he had ever thought\nbefore. He needed the girl as an ally. Not as a slave. She had to be\nwilling. She had to co-operate. Give her a warped picture of the rest of\nthe galaxy? Convince her its governments were evil, totalitarian, when\nin reality they were democratic? Convince her that he alone, given\nunlimited power, could right the wrongs of a thousand worlds? She was\nnaive enough for that sort of approach, he thought. Besides, it would\nstrike her as something like creation--moral creation, perhaps. And\ncreation she would understand. Then, with her as his partner, he could\nquickly build a war machine which the combined might of the galaxy\ncouldn't stand against. And that, he suddenly realized, would even\ninclude an unlimited number of soldiers for occupation and policing\nduties. This power would be unparalleled.\n\n\"I have something I want to tell you about,\" he said. \"It will take a\nlong time and we must be undisturbed, which is why I asked you to bring\nme here.\"\n\n\"What is it you want to tell me?\"\n\nBefore Glaudot could answer, they heard a crashing, rending sound not\ntoo far off in the woods. It sounded to Glaudot exactly as if trees were\nbeing uprooted, boulders strewn carelessly.\n\n\"Cyclopes!\" Robin screamed in terror, and began to run.\n\nGlaudot ran after her, stumbling, picking himself up, hurtling in\npursuit. He couldn't let her get away. He had to follow her ...\n\nNothing living, he told himself as he ran, could uproot those huge\ntrees. Of course, there were the saplings, but even the saplings were\nthe size of full-grown oaks and maples on far Earth.\n\nSomething roared behind him. The sound was pitched almost too low for\nhuman ears. He whirled. The earth shook, great clods of it flying. Bare\ntree roots suddenly appeared, and a young tree the size of a towering\noak was lifted skyward.\n\nBehind it, brandishing it and then hurling it away, was a naked man\nwhose head towered impossibly a hundred and fifty feet into the air.\nTrembling, awestruck, Glaudot looked up at the great savage face. Wild\nhair streaming, filthy beard matted with dirt and tree-branches, it was\nthe most ferocious face Glaudot had ever seen.\n\nAnd it had only one eye, one enormous eye in the middle of its head. But\nan eye three feet across!\n\n\"A Cyclops!\" Robin screamed again.\n\nA moment later the creature stooped and with a scooping motion of its\ngreat right hand picked up the two tiny creatures on the forest floor\nbeneath it. Then it ran, uprooting oak-sized saplings, back toward the\nrocky hillside where it dwelled, after the Cyclopes of old on which\nRobin and Charlie had naively patterned it, in a cave overlooking the\nsea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Where, man? Where?\" Captain Purcell demanded.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Charlie said. \"I really don't think she would. You see,\nshe always threatened she'd go there if we ever had a fight, but she was\nusually half-joking. She knows it's dangerous--\"\n\n\"But where? Don't you know a drowning man has to grasp at straws?\nHaven't I gotten it across to you--the whole galaxy may be in danger!\"\n\nCharlie sighed. \"I don't understand much of your galaxy. Robin knows the\nencyclopedia--she would understand. And I--I only want to know Robin is\nsafe.\" He took a deep breath and said: \"She always threatened to go to\nthe Land of the Cyclopes.\"\n\n\"Then take us there at once,\" Captain Purcell said....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf he shouted and cried now, he would go insane. He knew that. He tried\nto hold his fear in check. He was being swung pendulum-like in an\nenormous hand as the one-eyed giant loped along. Robin shared the\nclenched-fist prison with him. Her hair streamed in the wind as the huge\narm swung the huge hand in time with the giant's enormous strides.\n\n\"Does it eat people?\" he managed to ask Robin. He had to shout because\nthe wind created by the creature's movement was considerable. The ground\nspun giddily far, far below them, whirling patches of green, of yellow,\nof brown.\n\n\"We made them to eat people. Like in the book. We were just children.\nIt seemed--it seemed so thrilling.\"\n\nThe Cyclops loped along, uprooting saplings. After a while it began to\nclimb a rocky slope and from the heights Glaudot could see the shores of\nan unknown sea. Then the Cyclops reached a cave entrance and rolled\naside a huge boulder and took his prisoners within.\n\nGlaudot heard the bleating of sheep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why, it's a fortune in jewels!\" Captain Purcell exclaimed. They had\nfound the glade in the forest, where Robin had created a king's ransom\nfor Glaudot. The men gathered around, many of them struck dumb by the\nsight of all this wealth.\n\nCharlie said: \"Captain, look.\"\n\nPurcell went over to him and saw the wide swathe cut through the forest\nand curving out of sight. \"What went through there?\" he gasped.\n\n\"A Cyclops,\" Charlie said grimly. \"A Cyclops has them. Captain, we've\ngot to hurry. Listen, there are two horses now. I could create horses\nfor all of us, but all these men coming up would probably be seen by the\nCyclops. You come on foot with your men. Let one of them come with me\non the stallions.\" As he spoke Charlie unslung the Mannlicher and put it\ndown.\n\n\"Oh, you want our more modern weapons?\" Purcell asked.\n\nCharlie shook his head. \"For fun, Robin and I made the Cyclopes\ninvulnerable to any kind of attack except the kind mentioned in the\nencyclopedia--putting out their single eye with a stake. To protect all\nthe other people we created, we made the Cyclopes so they'd never want\nto leave their homeland. So if we can get Robin and your man Glaudot\nfree, they'll be safe. Now, who's the volunteer?\"\n\n\"I'm already on horseback,\" Chandler said. Charlie nodded and mounted\nthe second roan stallion.\n\n\"My men will be coming as fast as they can march,\" Captain Purcell said.\n\nCharlie nodded. He did not bother to tell the captain that a Cyclops\ncould cover in a few minutes ground a marching party could not hope to\ncover in as many hours. He set off at a swift gallop with Chandler.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Will he eat us now?\" said Glaudot. Strangely, he was not afraid. The\nunexpected nature of their impending demise he almost found amusing.\n\nRobin shook her head. \"I don't think so. He'll probably drink himself to\nsleep. We made the Cyclopes great drunkards.\"\n\nThe Cyclops, his tree-trunk sized walking stick leaning against the\nwall, was reclining and drinking from a huge bowl of wine. The cave was\ntorchlit. Seventy or eighty sheep milled about, settling for the night\nafter three of their number had supplied a meal for the giant, who had\neaten them raw.\n\n\"Isn't there anything we can do?\" demanded Glaudot, whose dreams of\ngalactic conquest were fading before the spectre of being eaten alive.\n\n\"Reserve your strength until he sleeps,\" Robin said. \"Of course there's\nsomething we can do.\"\n\n\"Yes? What?\"\n\n\"His walking stick. You see the end comes almost to a point? We harden\nit in the fire--and put his eye out. Then, in the morning, when he\nunrolls the stone from the cave-entrance and blindly leads his flock\nout, we hide among the sheep and make our escape. At least that's how it\nhappens in the encyclopedia.\"\n\nGlaudot swallowed hard. He had never had a great deal of physical\ncourage....\n\nJust then they heard a great fluttering, groaning sound. Robin said:\n\"You see, he's asleep. He's snoring.\"\n\n\"I--I don't think I could possibly--\"\n\n\"He's liable to want us for breakfast. Come on.\"\n\nThey got up swiftly and silently, and crept to the walking stick. It was\nthe size of a young tree. It would be heavy, perhaps too heavy for them\nto handle.\n\n\"Easy now,\" Robin said. She nimbly climbed the ledges on the cave-wall\nand tipped the great walking stick, then leaped down and grabbed the\nfront end as Glaudot got a grip on the rear of the big pole.\n\n\"Heavy,\" Glaudot said.\n\n\"But not too heavy, I--I think.\"\n\n\"Try to lift it,\" said Glaudot.\n\nThey tried. Together they could barely get it overhead.\n\n\"Try to poke it at something,\" Glaudot said.\n\nThey could not. Robin sighed. They put it down slowly, quietly. It would\ntake more than the two of them. It would take them and two or three more\nmen to do the job.\n\n\"We wait,\" Glaudot said bleakly.\n\nRobin stared up in frustration at the smoke hole, through which smoke\nfrom the Cyclops's fire poured out into the gathering night. It was\nhopelessly over their head, although help could reach them through it\nfrom the outside. But how could they possibly expect help to come...?\n\n\"We wait,\" Glaudot said again, hopelessly.\n\n\"For breakfast,\" Robin said.\n\nGlaudot broke suddenly. \"I don't want to die!\" he cried. \"I don't want\nto die ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe feeblest of Crimson's three suns came over the horizon, lighting the\nlandscape with the illumination of three or four full moons on Earth.\n\n\"I told you I smelled smoke!\" Charlie cried, pointing triumphantly at\nthe thin tendril of smoke that rose through the cooling air against the\nweak sunlight.\n\n\"Is it a campfire?\" Chandler asked.\n\n\"Chimney hole, probably. Come on.\"\n\nThey left the two stallions grazing at the base of the rocky escarpment.\nThey began to climb. Once Chandler stumbled and went sliding down the\nrocky slope, but Charlie caught his arm, all but wrenching it from the\nsocket. Charlie thought: we have to hurry. Their lives may depend on it.\nAlready we may be too late....\n\nThe smoke from the chimney hole was acrid. It was very strong now.\nSuddenly Charlie could feel the slightly increased slope of the rocks.\nThe slope was precipitous now, almost perpendicular.\n\n\"I can't--can't go much further!\" Chandler groaned.\n\n\"We've got to, man. We've got to.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He's waking,\" said Robin.\n\nGlaudot had broken completely. The confident would-be conqueror was\nreduced to trembling and whining now. \"M-maybe he's hungry. Oh, God,\nmaybe he's hungry ...\"\n\nBut the Cyclops only turned over in its sleep and began to snore again.\nThe fire had burned low. The sheep were resting. Robin thought of\nCharlie, probably many miles away. There would be a late moonrise\ntonight, she thought. They often spoke of the feeblest of Crimson's\nthree suns as the moon, although it really wasn't. Then dawn would come.\nIf the Cyclops were hungry and wanted a change in diet ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But you'll choke to death going down there,\" Chandler protested.\n\n\"It's only a chimney hole. Nobody's going to choke to death.\"\n\n\"Can you see down it?\"\n\n\"No. Too much smoke.\"\n\n\"Then how do you know how far we'll have to fall?\"\n\n\"I don't. I'll have to take the chance. You don't have to, though.\"\n\n\"I'll go where you go. That's what I volunteered for.\"\n\n\"Good. It's almost morning, so the fire's probably almost burned down\nfrom now. If you land in the embers, jump aside quickly. You\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Chandler said.\n\nWithout another word, Charlie suddenly lowered himself into the smoke\nand let go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDim fiery light lit the cave. He alighted in embers and quickly jumped\nclear. Embers flew. A ram bleated. Charlie saw the enormous sleeping\nbulk of the Cyclops against one wall of the cave. He heard something\nbehind him, and whirled. It was Chandler. More sparks flew. The sheep\nbleated again, louder this time.\n\nRobin and a spaceman who was probably Glaudot came toward them. There\nwas amazement on Robin's face. Glaudot looked like a child in the grip\nof terror he couldn't quite understand.\n\nCharlie held Robin close for a moment. \"Quiet,\" he whispered. \"Listen.\"\n\nThe slight disturbance had bothered the Cyclops. He was half awake. He\nmade noises with his lips. One great arm lifted and fell. It could have\ncrushed the four of them.\n\n\"There's a stake,\" Robin said. \"Just like in the book.\"\n\nThey got it and took it to the embers of the fire between them. Glaudot,\nwho brought up the rear, dragged his end, the wood scraping on the rocky\nfloor.\n\n\"Lift it up,\" Charlie said.\n\nGlaudot giggled and then began to cry. He was hysterical. \"The three of\nus?\" Charlie asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Robin said.\n\nGlaudot laughed hysterically. The Cyclops stirred. That made up\nCharlie's mind. He placed his end of the stake carefully on the floor\nand went back to Glaudot. He struck Glaudot neatly and precisely on the\npoint of the jaw and Glaudot collapsed in his arms.\n\nThen they returned with the stake to the fire. Charlie scraped and\npushed the embers together with a charcoal log. They began to toast the\npoint of the stake.\n\n\"We've got to hurry,\" Robin said.\n\n\"The skin of his eyelid is like armor plate,\" Charlie told her. \"We've\ngot to make sure it doesn't turn the point aside.\"\n\nThe flock stirred and began to grow more lively. It was now dawn\noutside. The Cyclops yawned in his sleep and stretched out an arm the\nsize of an oak tree.\n\n\"Hurry!\" Robin said urgently.\n\nThe Cyclops rolled over, its face to the wall.\n\n\"The eye!\" Charlie groaned. \"We'll never be able to reach the eye now.\"\n\nThey kept at their work, though. There was nothing else they could do.\nThe surface wood of the big stake was taking on a dull cherry-red color.\nFinally Charlie said: \"That's enough, I guess.\"\n\nThe Cyclops rolled over again. They were in luck, Charlie thought, but\nchanged his mind immediately. The Cyclops sat up, its eye blinking\nsleepily. It yawned and stretched mightily, then stared stupidly for a\nfew moments at the flock of sheep. Charlie and the others stood frozen,\nnot daring to move. The Cyclops brushed at the sheep with its hand, and\ntwo of them crashed with bone-crushing thuds and death-rattle bleats\nagainst the wall. The Cyclops glared stupidly about, its one great eye\nsquinting. Clearly, it was looking for something else to eat. Not sheep.\nPeople ...\n\nIt got down on hands and knees and groped on the floor. The arm swept\nout. The hand flashed ponderously by, missing Robin by only a few feet.\nThe Cyclops advanced on its knees, searching, its mouth slavering now.\nIt was hungry and soon it would eat ...\n\nThe hand swept by again, caught a sheep. The hand lifted, the sheep\nbleated, the jaws crunched once and the sheep disappeared. The Cyclops\nwiped a trace of blood from its lips. The hand came down again,\ncloser ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The stake!\" Charlie whispered fiercely.\n\nThey brought it up horizontally. Charlie stood just behind the point,\nRobin behind him, Chandler in the rear. They jabbed with the stake as\nthe Cyclops's hand swept along the floor again. The Cyclops roared with\npain and rage and beat both mighty hands on the rocky floor, attempting\nto crush its tormentors.\n\nJust then Glaudot regained consciousness and stood up groggily. \"Don't\nmove!\" Charlie warned, taking the chance of revealing their own position\nin an attempt to save Glaudot's life.\n\nBut Glaudot, seeing the huge creature so close, began to run. It was\nlike running on a treadmill. He ran and he ran and after a while the\nCyclops reached down and plucked him off the floor. He screamed thinly.\nThere was the same crunching as before--and no Glaudot ...\n\nNow the Cyclops, its appetite whetted, searched the floor in a frenzy of\nearnest on hands and knees. The great head swung low, close to the\nfloor, the single eye stared myopically. Once the huge hand clubbed the\nrock so close to them that Charlie could feel the floor shaking. They\nretreated slowly toward the far wall of the cave, the monster following\nrelentlessly. They still held the heavy stake between them but had not\nyet gathered either the strength or the courage for their one try. If\nthey failed--\n\nThey had backed up as far as they could. The wall was behind them. The\nmonster came on, its head low, its nose practically scraping the ground.\nIt swept the floor with a giant hand, a fingertip barely touching\nCharlie and almost knocking him senseless. He shook his head and took\ndeep breaths until his strength returned.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, as the hand began its swinging arc again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey ran forward toward the creature's single eye with the stake.\n\nCharlie barely remembered the contact, or the bath of eye-fluid and\nblood which followed, or the wild roaring of the brute creature, or its\nfrantic charging back and forth, blinded, across the cave, while the\nflock bleated and stampeded. After a while the crazed Cyclops ran to the\ncave entrance and shouldered the great door-rock aside, rushing out into\nthe day.\n\nIt went tearing down the slope and did not stop until, battered and\nbleeding, it reached the sea. It stood on the narrow strand of beach for\na moment, scooping great handfuls of water for its stricken eye. Then\nit plunged into the surf.\n\nThey went outside and watched it. They made their way down the slope\nwhile it advanced into the sea. Finally only the great head remained\nabove the waves.\n\nThey reached the shore.\n\nThe Cyclops was gone.\n\nMoments later, Captain Purcell and the others joined them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Then you mean you won't come back to Earth with us?\" Purcell asked\nlater, in the spaceship.\n\n\"Not if all you say about this world is true,\" Charlie said. \"We're\nneeded here.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Purcell agreed. \"With your help, the galaxy could be made into a\nuniverse of plenty for everyone.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Robin. \"We'll have to think of training children to take\nover after we're gone.\" She looked at Charlie. She blushed. \"Such as our\nown,\" she said, very quickly, and added: \"You can marry us, can't you,\nCaptain?\"\n\nPurcell beamed, and nodded, and did so.\n\nLater, Charlie said: \"It isn't only that we're needed here, is it,\ndarling?\"\n\nRobin shook her head. \"We like it here,\" she said.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ September 1956.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
