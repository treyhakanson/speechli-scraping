Abednego Danner was a professor of biology in a small\ncollege in the town of Indian Creek. He was a spindling wisp of a man,\nwith a nature drawn well into itself by the assaults of the world and\nparticularly of the grim Mrs. Danner, who understood nothing and\nundertook all. Nevertheless these two lived modestly in a frame house on\nthe hem of Indian Creek and they appeared to be a settled and peaceful\ncouple.\n\nThe chief obstacle to Mrs. Danner's placid dominion of her hearth was\nProfessor Danner's laboratory, which occupied a room on the first floor\nof the house. It was the one impregnable redoubt in her domestic\nstronghold. Neither threat nor entreaty would drive him and what she\ntermed his \"stinking, unchristian, unhealthy dinguses\" from that room.\nAfter he had lectured vaguely to his classes on the structure of the\n_Paramecium caudatum_ and the law discovered by Mendel, he would shut\nthe door behind himself, and all the fury of the stalwart, black-haired\nwoman could not drive him out until his own obscure ends were served.\n\nIt never occurred to Professor Danner that he was a great man or a\ngenius. His alarm at such a notion would have been pathetic. He was so\nfascinated by the trend of his thoughts and experiments, in fact, that\nhe scarcely realized by what degrees he had outstripped a world that\nwore picture hats, hobble skirts, and straps beneath its trouser legs.\nHowever, as the century turned and the fashions changed, he was carried\nfurther from them, which was just as well.\n\nOn a certain Sunday he sat beside his wife in church, singing snatches\nof the hymns in a doleful and untrue voice and meditating, during the\nlong sermon, on the structure of chromosomes. She, bolt upright and\novershadowing him, like a coffin in the pew, rigid lest her black silk\nrustle, thrilled in some corner of her mind at the picture of hell and\nsalvation.\n\nMr. Danner's thoughts turned to Professor Mudge, whose barren pate\nshowed above the congregation a few rows ahead of him. There, he said to\nhimself, sat a stubborn and unenlightened man. And so, when the weekly\ntyranny of church was ended, he asked Mudge to dinner. That he\naccomplished by an argument with his wife, audible the length of the\naisle.\n\nThey walked to the Danner residence. Mrs. Danner changed her clothes\nhurriedly, basted the roast, made milk sauce for the string beans, and\nset three places. They went into the dining-room. Danner carved, the\nhome-made mint jelly was passed, the bread, the butter, the gravy; and\nMrs. Danner dropped out of the conversation, after guying her husband on\nhis lack of skill at his task of carving.\n\nMudge opened with the usual comment. \"Well, Abednego, how are the\nblood-stream radicals progressing?\"\n\nHis host chuckled. \"Excellently, thanks. Some day I'll be ready to jolt\nyou hidebound biologists into your senses.\"\n\nMudge's left eyebrow lifted. \"So? Still the same thing, I take it? Still\nbelieve that chemistry controls human destiny?\"\n\n\"Almost ready to demonstrate it,\" Danner replied.\n\n\"Along what lines?\"\n\n\"Muscular strength and the nervous discharge of energy.\"\n\nMudge slapped his thigh. \"Ho ho! Nervous discharge of energy. You assume\nthe human body to be a voltaic pile, eh? That's good. I'll have to tell\nGropper. He'll enjoy it.\"\n\nDanner, in some embarrassment, gulped a huge mouthful of meat. \"Why\nnot?\" he said. \"Look at the insects--the ants. Strength a hundred times\nour own. An ant can carry a large spider--yet an ant is tissue and\nfiber, like a man. If a man could be given the same sinews--he could\nwalk off with his own house.\"\n\n\"Ha ha! There's a good one. Maybe you'll do it, Abednego.\"\n\n\"Possibly, possibly.\"\n\n\"And you would make a splendid piano-mover.\"\n\n\"Pianos! Pooh! Consider the grasshoppers. Make a man as strong as a\ngrasshopper--and he'll be able to leap over a church. I tell you, there\nis something that determines the quality of every muscle and nerve. Find\nit--transplant it--and you have the solution.\"\n\nMirth overtook Professor Mudge in a series of paroxysms from which he\nemerged rubicund and witty. \"Probably your grasshopper man will look\nlike a grasshopper--more insect than man. At least, Danner, you have\nimagination.\"\n\n\"Few people have,\" Danner said, and considered that he had acquitted\nhimself.\n\nHis wife interrupted at that point. \"I think this nonsense has gone far\nenough. It is wicked to tamper with God's creatures. It is wicked to\ndiscuss such matters--especially on the Sabbath. Abednego, I wish you\nwould give up your work in the laboratory.\"\n\nDanner's cranium was overlarge and his neck small; but he stiffened it\nto hold himself in a posture of dignity. \"Never.\"\n\nHis wife gazed from the defiant pose to the locked door visible through\nthe parlour. She stirred angrily in her clothes and speared a morsel of\nfood. \"You'll be punished for it.\"\n\nLater in the day Mudge and Gropper laughed heartily at the expense of\nthe former's erstwhile host. Danner read restively. He was forbidden to\nwork on the Sabbath. It was his only compromise. Matilda Danner turned\nthe leaves of the Bible and meditated in a partial vacuum of day-dreams.\n\nOn Monday Danner hastened home from his classes. During the night he had\nhad a new idea. And a new idea was a rare thing after fourteen years of\ngroping investigation. \"Alkaline radicals,\" he murmured as he crossed\nhis lawn. He considered a group of ultra-microscopic bodies. He had no\nname for them. They were the \"determinants\" of which he had talked. He\nlocked the laboratory door behind himself and bent over the microscope\nhe had designed. \"Huh!\" he said. An hour later, while he stirred a\nsolution in a beaker, he said: \"Huh!\" again. He repeated it when his\nwife called him to dinner. The room was a maze of test tubes, bottles,\nburners, retorts, instruments. During the meal he did not speak.\nAfterwards he resumed work. At twelve he prepared six tadpole eggs and\nput them to hatch. It would be his three hundred and sixty-first\nseparate tadpole hatching.\n\nThen, one day in June, Danner crossed the campus with unusual haste.\nBirds were singing, a gentle wind eddied over the town from the slopes\nof the Rocky Mountains, flowers bloomed. The professor did not heed the\nreburgeoning of nature. A strange thing had happened to him that\nmorning. He had peeped into his workroom before leaving for the college\nand had come suddenly upon a phenomenon.\n\nOne of the tadpoles had hatched in its aquarium. He observed it eagerly,\nfirst because it embodied his new idea, and second because it swam with\na rare activity. As he looked, the tadpole rushed at the side of its\ndomicile. There was a tinkle and a splash. It had swum through the plate\nglass! For an instant it lay on the floor. Then, with a flick of its\ntail, it flew into the air and hit the ceiling of the room.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Danner said. Old years of work were at an end. New years of\nexcitement lay ahead. He snatched the creature and it wriggled from his\ngrasp. He caught it again. His fist was not sufficiently strong to hold\nit. He left it, flopping in eight-foot leaps, and went to class with\nconsiderable suppressed agitation and some reluctance. The determinant\nwas known. He had made a living creature abnormally strong.\n\nWhen he reached his house and unlocked the door of the laboratory, he\nfound that four tadpoles, in all, had hatched. Before they expired in\nthe unfamiliar element of air, they had demolished a quantity of\napparatus.\n\nMrs. Danner knocked on the door. \"What's been going on in there?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" her husband answered.\n\n\"Nothing! It sounded like nothing! What have you got there? A cat?\"\n\n\"No--yes.\"\n\n\"Well--I won't have such goings on, and that's all there is to it.\"\n\nDanner collected the d\u00e9bris. He buried the tadpoles. One was dissected\nfirst. Then he wrote for a long time in his notebook. After that he went\nout and, with some difficulty, secured a pregnant cat. A week later he\nchloroformed the tabby and inoculated her. Then he waited. He had been\npatient for a long time. It was difficult to be patient now.\n\nWhen the kittens were born into this dark and dreary world, Mr. Danner\nassisted as sole obstetrician. In their first hours nothing marked them\nas unique. The professor selected one and drowned the remainder. He\nremembered the tadpoles and made a simple calculation.\n\nWhen the kitten was two weeks old and its eyes opened, it was dieting on\nall its mother's milk and more besides. The professor considered that\nfact significant. Then one day it committed matricide.\n\nProbably the playful blow of its front paw was intended in the best\nspirit. Certainly the old tabby, receiving it, was not prepared for such\nviolence from its offspring. Danner gasped. The kitten had unseamed its\nmother in a swift and horrid manner. He put the cat out of its misery\nand tended the kitten with trepidation. It grew. It ate--beefsteaks and\nchops, bone and all.\n\nWhen it reached three weeks, it began to jump alarmingly. The laboratory\nwas not large enough. The professor brought it its food with the\nexpression of a man offering a wax sausage to a hungry panther.\n\nOn a peaceful Friday evening Danner built a fire to stave off the\nrigours of a cold snap. He and Mrs. Danner sat beside the friendly\nblaze. Her sewing was in her lap, and in his was a book to which he paid\nscant attention. The kitten, behind its locked door, thumped and mewed.\n\n\"It's hungry,\" Mrs. Danner said. \"If you must keep a cat, why don't you\nfeed it?\"\n\n\"I do,\" he answered. He refrained, for politic reasons, from mentioning\nwhat and how much he fed it. The kitten mewed again.\n\n\"Well,\" she repeated, \"it sounds hungry.\"\n\nDanner fidgeted. The laboratory was unheated and consequently chilly.\nFrom its gloomy interior the kitten peered beneath the door and saw the\nfire. It sensed warmth. The feline affinity for hearths drew it. One paw\nscratched tentatively on the door.\n\n\"It's cold,\" Mrs. Danner said. \"Why don't you bring it here? No, I don't\nwant it here. Take it a cover.\"\n\n\"It--it has a cover.\" Danner did not wish to go into that dark room.\n\nThe kitten scratched again and then it became earnest. There was a\nsplitting, rending sound. The bottom panel of the door was torn away and\nit emerged nonchalantly, crossing the room and curling up by the fire.\n\nFor five minutes Mrs. Danner sat motionless. Her eyes at length moved\nfrom the kitten to her husband's quivering face and then to the broken\ndoor. On his part, he made no move. The kitten was a scant six inches\nfrom his foot. Mrs. Danner rose. She went to the door and studied the\norifice, prying at it with her fingers as if to measure the kitten's\nstrength by her own. Then she turned the key and peered into the gloom.\nThat required either consummate nerve or great curiosity. After her\ninspection she sat down again.\n\nTen minutes passed. Danner cleared his throat. Then she spoke. \"So.\nYou've done it?\"\n\n\"Done what?\" he asked innocently.\n\n\"You've made all this rubbish you've been talking about strength--happen\nto that kitten.\"\n\n\"It wasn't rubbish.\"\n\n\"Evidently.\"\n\nAt that crisis Mr. Danner's toe trembled and the kitten, believing it a\nnew toy, curled its paws over the shoe. There was a sound of tearing\nleather, and the shoe came apart. Fortunately the foot inside it was not\nhurt severely. Danner did not dare to budge. He heard his wife's\nstartled inhalation.\n\nMrs. Danner did not resume her sewing. She breathed heavily and slow\nfire crept into her cheeks. The enormity of the crime overcame her. And\nshe perceived that the hateful laboratory had invaded her portion of\nthe house. Moreover, her sturdy religion had been desecrated. Danner\nread her thoughts.\n\n\"Don't be angry,\" he said. Beads of perspiration gathered on his brow.\n\n\"Angry!\" The kitten stirred at the sound of her voice. \"Angry! And why\nnot? Here you defied God and man--and made that creature of the devil.\nYou've overrun my house. You're a wicked, wicked man. And as for that\ncat, I won't have it. I won't stand for it.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\nHer voice rose to a scream. \"Do! Do! Plenty--and right here and now.\"\nShe ran to the kitchen and came back with a broom. She flung the front\ndoor wide. Her blazing eyes rested for a moment on the kitten. To her it\nhad become merely an obnoxious little animal. \"Scat! You little demon!\"\nThe broom came down on the cat's back with a jarring thud.\n\nAfter that, chaos. A ball of fur lashed through the air. What-not, bird\ncage, bookcase, morris chair flew asunder. Then the light went out. In\nthe darkness a comet, a hurricane, ricochetted through the room. Then\nthere was a crash mightier than the others, followed by silence.\n\nWhen Danner was able, he picked himself up and lighted the lamp. His\nwife lay on the floor in a dead faint. He revived her. She sat up and\nwept silently over the wreck of her parlour. Danner paled. A round\nhole--a hole that could have been made by nothing but a solid cannon\nshot--showed where the kitten had left the room through the wall.\n\nMrs. Danner's eyes were red-rimmed. Her breath came jerkily. With\nincredulous little gestures she picked herself up and gazed at the hole.\nA draught blew through it. Mr. Danner stuffed it with a rug.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" she said.\n\n\"If it comes back--we'll call it Samson.\"\n\nAnd--as soon as Samson felt the gnawing of appetite, he returned to his\nrightful premises. Mrs. Danner fed him. Her face was pale and her hands\ntrembled. Horror and fascination fought with each other in her soul as\nshe offered the food. Her husband was in his classroom, nervously trying\nto fix his wits on the subject of the day.\n\n\"Kitty, kitty, poor little kitty,\" she said.\n\nSamson purred and drank a quart of milk. She concealed her astonishment\nfrom herself. Mrs. Danner's universe was undergoing a transformation.\n\nAt three in the afternoon the kitten scratched away the screen door on\nthe back porch and entered the house. Mrs. Danner fed it the supper\nmeat.\n\nDanner saw it when he returned. It was chasing flies in the yard. He\nstood in awe. The cat could spring twenty or thirty feet with ease. Then\nthe sharp spur of dread entered him. Suppose someone saw and asked\nquestions. He might be arrested, taken to prison. Something would\nhappen. He tried to analyze and solve the problem. Night came. The cat\nwas allowed to go out unmolested. In the morning the town of Indian\nCreek rose to find that six large dogs had been slain during the dark\nhours. A panther had come down from the mountains, they said. And Danner\nlectured with a dry tongue and errant mind.\n\nIt was Will Hoag, farmer of the fifth generation, resident of the\nenvirons of Indian Creek, church-goer, and hard-cider addict, who bent\nhimself most mercilessly on the capture of the alleged panther. His\nchicken-house suffered thrice and then his sheep-fold. After four such\ndepredations he cleaned his rifle and undertook a vigil from a spot\nbehind the barn. An old moon rose late and illuminated his pastures with\na blue glow. He drank occasionally from a jug to ward off the evil\neffects of the night air.\n\nSome time after twelve his attention was distracted from the jug by\nstealthy sounds. He moved toward them. A hundred yards away his cows\nwere huddled together--a heap of dun shadows. He saw a form which he\nmistook for a weasel creeping toward the cows. As he watched, he\nperceived that the small animal behaved singularly unlike a weasel. It\nslid across the earth on taut limbs, as if it was going to attack the\ncows. Will Hoag repressed a guffaw.\n\nThen the farmer's short hair bristled. The cat sprang and landed on the\nneck of the nearest cow and clung there. Its paw descended. There was a\nhorrid sound of ripping flesh, a moan, the thrashing of hoofs, a blot\nof dribbling blood, and the cat began to gorge on its prey.\n\nHoag believed that he was intoxicated, that delirium tremens had\novertaken him. He stood rooted to the spot. The marauder ignored him.\nSlowly, unbelievingly, he raised his rifle and fired. The bullet knocked\nthe cat from its perch. Mr. Hoag went forward and picked it up.\n\n\"God Almighty,\" he whispered. The bullet had not penetrated the cat's\nskin. And, suddenly, it wriggled in his hand. He dropped it. A flash of\nfur in the moonlight, and he was alone with the corpse of his Holstein.\n\nHe contemplated profanity, he considered kneeling in prayer. His joints\nturned to water. He called faintly for his family. He fell unconscious.\n\nWhen Danner heard of that exploit--it was relayed by jeering tongues who\nsaid the farmer was drunk and a panther had killed the cow--his lips set\nin a line of resolve. Samson was taking too great liberties. It might\nattack a person, in which case he, Danner, would be guilty of murder.\nThat day he did not attend his classes. Instead, he prepared a\nrelentless poison in his laboratory and fed it to the kitten in a brace\nof meaty chops. The dying agonies of Samson, aged seven weeks, were\nHomeric.\n\nAfter that, Danner did nothing for some days. He wondered if his formul\u00e6\nand processes should be given to the world. But, being primarily a man\nof vast imagination, he foresaw hundreds of rash experiments. Suppose,\nhe thought, that his discovery was tried on a lion, or an elephant! Such\na creature would be invincible. The tadpoles were dead. The kitten had\nbeen buried. He sighed wearily and turned his life into its usual\ncourses.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nBefore the summer was ended, however, a new twist of his life and\naffairs started the mechanism of the professor's imagination again. It\nwas announced to him when he returned from summer school on a hot\nafternoon. He dropped his portfolio on the parlour desk, one corner of\nwhich still showed the claw-marks of the miscreant Samson, and sat down\nwith a comfortable sigh.\n\n\"Abednego.\" His wife seldom addressed him by his first name.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I--I--I want to tell you something.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Haven't you noticed any difference in me lately?\"\n\nHe had never noticed a difference in his wife. When they reached old\nage, he would still be unable to discern it. He shook his head and\nlooked at her with some apprehension. She was troubled. \"What's the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"I suppose you wouldn't--yet,\" she said. \"But--well--I'm with child.\"\n\nThe professor folded his upper lip between his thumb and forefinger.\n\"With child? Pregnant? You mean--\"\n\n\"I'm going to have a baby.\"\n\nSoon after their marriage the timid notion of parenthood had escaped\nthem. They had, in fact, avoided its mechanics except on those rare\nevenings when tranquillity and the reproductive urge conspired to imbue\nhim with courage and her with sinfulness. Nothing came of that\ninfrequent union. They never expected anything.\n\nAnd now they were faced with it. He murmured: \"A baby.\"\n\nFaint annoyance moved her. \"Yes. That's what one has. What are we going\nto do?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Matilda. But I'm glad.\"\n\nShe softened. \"So am I, Abednego.\"\n\nThen a hissing, spattering sound issued from the kitchen. \"The beans!\"\nMrs. Danner said. The second idyl of their lives was finished.\n\nAlone in his bed, tossing on the humid muslin sheets, Danner struggled\nwithin himself. The hour that was at hand would be short. The logical\nstep after the tadpoles and the kitten was to vaccinate the human mammal\nwith his serum. To produce a super-child, an invulnerable man. As a\nscientist he was passionately intrigued by the idea. As a husband he\nwas dubious. As a member of society he was terrified.\n\nThat his wife would submit to the plan or to the step it necessitated\nwas beyond belief. She would never allow a sticky tube of foreign animal\nmatter to be poured into her veins. She would not permit the will of God\nto be altered or her offspring to be the subject of experiment. Another\nman would have laughed at the notion of persuading her. Mr. Danner never\nlaughed at matters that involved his wife.\n\nThere was another danger. If the child was female and became a woman\nlike his wife, then the effect of such strength would be awful indeed.\nHe envisioned a militant reformer, an iron-bound Calvinist, remodelling\nthe world single-handed. A Scotch Lilith, a matronly Gabriel, a\nshe-Hercules. He shuddered.\n\nA hundred times he denied his science. A hundred and one times it begged\nhim to be served. Each decision to drop the idea was followed by an\neffort to discover means to inoculate her without her knowledge. To his\nwakeful ears came the reverberation of her snores. He rose and paced the\nfloor. A scheme came to him. After that he was lost.\n\nMrs. Danner was surprised when her husband brought a bottle of\nblackberry cordial to her. It was his first gift to her in more than a\nyear. She was fond of cordial. He was not. She took a glass after supper\nand then a second, which she drank \"for him.\" He smiled nervously and\nurged her to drink it. His hands clenched and unclenched. When she\nfinished the second glass, he watched her constantly.\n\n\"I feel sleepy,\" she said.\n\n\"You're tired.\" He tried to dissemble the eagerness in his voice. \"Why\ndon't you lie down?\"\n\n\"Strange,\" she said a moment later. \"I'm not usually so--so--misty.\"\n\nHe nodded. The opiate in the cordial was working. She lay on the couch.\nShe slept. The professor hastened to his laboratory. An hour later he\nemerged with a hypodermic syringe in his hand. His wife lay limply, one\nhand touching the floor. Her stern, dark face was relaxed. He sat beside\nher. His conscience raged. He hated the duplicity his task required. His\neyes lingered on the swollen abdomen. It was cryptic, enigmatic, filled\nwith portent. He jabbed the needle. She did not stir. After that he\nsubstituted a partly empty bottle of cordial for the drugged liquor. It\nwas, perhaps, the most practical thing he had ever done in his life.\n\nMrs. Danner could not explain herself on the following morning. She\nbelaboured him. \"Why didn't you wake me and make me go to bed? Sleeping\nin my clothes! I never did such a thing in my life.\"\n\n\"I couldn't wake you. I tried.\"\n\n\"Rubbish.\"\n\n\"You were sleeping so hard--you refused to move.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, old as you are, I'd like to thrash you.\"\n\nDanner went to the college. There was nothing more to do, nothing more\nto require his concentration. He could wait--as he had waited before. He\ntrembled occasionally with the hope that his child would be a boy--a\nsane, healthy boy. Then, in the end, his work might bear fruit. \"The\n_Euglena viridis_,\" he said in flat tones, \"will be the subject of\nto-morrow's study. I want you gentlemen to diagram the structure of the\n_Euglena viridis_ and write five hundred words on its vital principles\nand processes. It is particularly interesting because it shares\nproperties that are animal with properties that are vegetable.\"\n\nSeptember, October, November. Chilly winds from the high mountains. The\nday-by-day freezing over of ponds and brooks. Smoke at the tops of\nchimneys. Snow. Thanksgiving. And always Mrs. Danner growing with the\nburden of her offspring. Mr. Danner sitting silent, watching, wondering,\nwaiting. It would soon be time.\n\nOn Christmas morning there entered into Mrs. Danner's vitals a pain that\nwas indefinable and at the same time certain. It thrust all thought from\nher mind. Then it diminished and she summoned her husband. \"Get the\ndoctor. It's coming.\"\n\nDanner tottered into the street and executed his errand. The doctor\nsmiled cheerfully. \"Just beginning? I'll be over this afternoon.\"\n\n\"But--good Lord--you can't leave her like--\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\nHe came home and found his wife dusting. He shook his head. \"Get Mrs.\nNolan,\" she said. Then she threw herself on the bed again.\n\nMrs. Nolan, the nearest neighbour, wife of Professor Nolan and mother of\nfour children, was delighted. This particular Christmas was going to be\na day of some excitement. She prepared hot water and bustled with\nunessential occupation. Danner sat prostrate in the parlour. He had done\nit. He had done more--and that would be known later. Perhaps it would\nfail. He hoped it would fail. He wrung his hands. The concept of another\nperson in his house had not yet occurred to him. Birth was his wife's\nsickness--until it was over.\n\nThe doctor arrived after Danner had made his third trip. Mrs. Nolan\nprepared lunch. \"I love to cook in other people's kitchens,\" she said.\nHe wanted to strike her. Curious, he thought. At three-thirty the\nindustry of the doctor and Mrs. Nolan increased and the silence of the\ntwo, paradoxically, increased with it.\n\nThen the early twilight fell. Mrs. Danner lay with her lank black\nhair plastered to her brow. She did not moan. Pain twisted and\nconvulsed her. Downstairs Danner sat and sweated. A cry--his wife's.\nAnother--unfamiliar. Scurrying feet on the bare parts of the floor. He\nlooked up. Mrs. Nolan leaned over the stair well.\n\n\"It's a boy, Mr. Danner. A beautiful boy. And husky. You never saw such\na husky baby.\"\n\n\"It ought to be,\" he said. They found him later in the back yard,\nprancing on the snow with weird, ungainly steps. A vacant smile lighted\nhis features. They didn't blame him.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nCalm and quiet held their negative sway over the Danner m\u00e9nage for an\nhour, and then there was a disturbed fretting that developed into a\nlusty bawl. The professor passed a fatigued hand over his brow. He was\nunaccustomed to the dissonances of his offspring. Young Hugo--they had\nnamed him after a maternal uncle--had attained the age of one week\nwithout giving any indication of unnaturalness.\n\nThat is not quite true. He was as fleshy as most healthy infants, but\nthe flesh was more than normally firm. He was inordinately active. His\neyes had been gray but, already, they gave promise of the inkiness they\nafterwards exhibited. He was born with a quantity of black hair--hair so\ndark as to be nearly blue. Abednego Danner, on seeing it, exercised the\nliberty which all husbands take, and investigated rumours of his wife's\nforbears with his most secret thoughts. The principal rumour was that\none of her lusty Covenanter grandsires had been intrigued by a squaw to\nthe point of forgetting his Psalms and recalling only the Song of\nSolomon.\n\nHowever that may have been, Hugo was an attractive and virile baby.\nDanner spent hours at the side of his crib speculating and watching for\nany sign of biological variation. But it was not until a week had passed\nthat he was given evidence. By that time he was ready to concede the\nfailure of his greatest experiment.\n\nThe baby bawled and presently stopped. And Mrs. Danner, who had put it\nto breast, suddenly called her husband. \"Abednego! Come here! Hurry!\"\n\nThe professor's heart skipped its regular timing and he scrambled to the\nfloor above. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nMrs. Danner was sitting in a rocking-chair. Her face was as white as\npaper. Only in her eyes was there a spark of life. He thought she was\ngoing to faint. \"What's the matter?\" he said again.\n\nHe looked at Hugo and saw nothing terrifying in the ravishing hunger\nwhich the infant showed.\n\n\"Matter! Matter! You know the matter!\"\n\nThen he knew and he realized that his wife had discovered. \"I don't. You\nlook frightened. Shall I bring some water?\"\n\nMrs. Danner spoke again. Her voice was icy, distant, terrible. \"I came\nin to feed him just a minute ago. He was lying in his crib. I tried\nto--to hug him and he put his arms out. As God lives, I could not pull\nthat baby to me! He was too strong, Abednego! Too strong. Too strong. I\ncouldn't unbend his little arms when he stiffened them. I couldn't\nstraighten them when he bent them. And he pushed me--harder than you\ncould push. Harder than I could push myself. I know what it means. You\nhave done your horrible thing to my baby. He's just a baby, Abednego.\nAnd you've done your thing to him. How could you? Oh, how could you!\"\n\nMrs. Danner rose and laid the baby gently on the chair. She stood before\nher husband, towering over him, raised her hand, and struck with all her\nforce. Mr. Danner fell to one knee, and a red welt lifted on his face.\nShe struck him again and he fell against the chair. Little Hugo was\ndislodged. One hand caught a rung of the chair back and he hung\nsuspended above the floor.\n\n\"Look!\" Mrs. Danner screamed.\n\nAs they looked, the baby flexed its arm and lifted itself back into the\nchair. It was a feat that a gymnast would have accomplished with\ndifficulty. Danner stared, ignoring the blows, the crimson on his cheek.\nFor once in his lifetime, he suddenly defied his wife. He pointed to the\nchild.\n\n\"Yes, look!\" His voice rang clearly. \"I did it. I vaccinated you the\nnight the cordial put you to sleep. And there's my son. He's strong.\nStronger than a lion's cub. And he'll increase in strength as he grows\nuntil Samson and Hercules would be pygmies beside him. He'll be the\nfirst of a new and glorious race. A race that doesn't have to\nfear--because it cannot know harm. No man can hurt him, no man can\nvanquish him. He will be mightier than any circumstances. He, son of a\nweak man, will be stronger than the beasts, even than the ancient\ndinosaurs, stronger than the tides, stronger than fate--strong as God is\nstrong. And you--you, Matilda--mother of him, will be proud of him. He\nwill be great and famous. You can knock me down. You can knock me down a\nthousand times. I have given you a son whose little finger you cannot\nbend with a crow-bar. Oh, all these years I've listened to you and\nobeyed you and--yes, I've feared you a little--and God must hate me for\nit. Now take your son. And my son. You cannot change him. You cannot\nbend him to your will. He is all I might have been. All that mankind\nshould be.\" Danner's voice broke and he sobbed. He relented. \"I know\nit's hard for you. It's against your religion--against your love, even.\nBut try to like him. He's no different from you and me--only stronger.\nAnd strength is a glorious thing, a great thing. Then--afterwards--if\nyou can--forgive me.\" He collapsed.\n\nBlood pounded in her ears. She stared at the huddled body of her\nhusband. He had stood like a prophet and spoken words of fire. She was\nshaken from her pettiness. For one moment she had loved Danner. In that\nsame instant she had glimpsed the superhuman energy that had driven him\nthrough the long years of discouragement to triumph. She had seen his\nsoul. She fell at his feet, and when Danner opened his eyes, he found\nher there, weeping. He took her in his arms, timidly, clumsily. \"Don't\ncry, Mattie. It'll be all right. You love him, don't you?\"\n\nShe stared at the babe. \"Of course I love him. Wash your face,\nAbednego.\"\n\nAfter that there was peace in the house, and with it the child grew.\nDuring the next months they ignored his peculiarities. When they found\nhim hanging outside his crib, they put him back gently. When he smashed\nthe crib, they discussed a better place for him to repose. No hysteria,\nno conflict. When, in the early spring, young Hugo began to recognize\nthem and to assert his feelings, they rejoiced as all parents rejoice.\n\nWhen he managed to vault the sill of the second-story window by some\nantic contortion of his limbs, they dismissed the episode. Mrs. Danner\nhad been baking. She heard the child's voice and it seemed to come from\nthe yard. Startled, incredulous, she rushed upstairs. Hugo was not in\nhis room. His wail drifted through the window. She looked out. He was\nlying in the yard, fifteen feet below. She rushed to his side. He had\nnot been hurt.\n\nDanner made a pen of the iron heads and feet of two old beds. He wired\nthem together. The baby was kept in the inclosure thus formed. The days\nwarmed and lengthened. No one except the Danners knew of the prodigy\nharboured by their unostentatious house. But the secret was certain to\nleak out eventually.\n\nMrs. Nolan, the next-door neighbour, was first to learn it. She had\ncalled on Mrs. Danner to borrow a cup of sugar. The call, naturally,\nincluded a discussion of various domestic matters and a visit to the\nbaby. She voiced a question that had occupied her mind for some time.\n\n\"Why do you keep the child in that iron thing? Aren't you afraid it will\nhurt itself?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\nMrs. Nolan viewed young Hugo. He was lying on a large pillow. Presently\nhe rolled off its surface. \"Active youngster, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Very,\" Mrs. Danner said, nervously.\n\nHugo, as if he understood and desired to demonstrate, seized a corner of\nthe pillow and flung it from him. It traversed a long arc and landed on\nthe floor. Mrs. Nolan was startled. \"Goodness! I never saw a child his\nage that could do that!\"\n\n\"No. Let's go downstairs. I want to show you some tidies I'm making.\"\n\nMrs. Nolan paid no attention. She put the pillow back in the pen and\nwatched while Hugo tossed it out. \"There's something funny about that.\nIt isn't normal. Have you seen a doctor?\"\n\nMrs. Danner fidgeted. \"Oh, yes. Little Hugo's healthy.\"\n\nLittle Hugo grasped the iron wall of his miniature prison. He pulled\nhimself toward it. His skirt caught in the floor. He pulled harder. The\npen moved toward him. A high soprano came from Mrs. Nolan. \"He's moved\nit! I don't think I could move it myself! I tell you, I'm going to ask\nthe doctor to examine him. You shouldn't let a child be like that.\"\n\nMrs. Danner, filled with consternation, sought refuge in prevarication.\n\"Nonsense,\" she said as calmly as she could. \"All we Douglases are like\nthat. Strong children. I had a grandfather who could lift a cider keg\nwhen he was five--two hundred pounds and more. Hugo just takes after\nhim, that's all.\"\n\nMrs. Nolan was annoyed. Partly because she was jealous of Hugo's\nprowess--her own children had been feeble and dull. Partly because she\nwas frightened--no matter how strong a person became, a baby had no\nright to be so powerful. Partly because she sensed that Mrs. Danner was\nnot telling the whole truth. She suspected that the Danners had found a\nnew way to raise children. \"Well,\" she said, \"all I have to say is that\nit'll damage him. It'll strain his little heart. It'll do him a lot of\nharm. If I had a child like that, I'd tie it up most of the time for the\nfirst few years.\"\n\n\"Kate,\" Mrs. Danner said unpleasantly, \"I believe you would.\"\n\nMrs. Nolan shrugged. \"Well--I'm glad none of my children are freaks,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"I'll get your sugar.\"\n\nIn the afternoon the minister called. He talked of the church and the\ntown until he felt his preamble adequate. \"I was wondering why you\ndidn't bring your child to be baptized, Mrs. Danner. And why you\ncouldn't come to church, now that it is old enough?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she replied carefully, \"the child is rather--irritable. And we\nthought we'd prefer to have it baptized at home.\"\n\n\"It's irregular.\"\n\n\"We'd prefer it.\"\n\n\"Very well. I'm afraid--\" he smiled--\"that you're a\nlittle--ah--unfamiliar with the upbringing of children. Natural--in the\ncase of the first-born. Quite natural. But--ah--I met Mrs. Nolan to-day.\nQuite by accident. And she said that you kept the child--ah--in an iron\npen. It seemed unnecessarily cruel to me--\"\n\n\"Did it?\" Mrs. Danner's jaw set squarely.\n\nBut the minister was not to be turned aside lightly. \"I'm afraid, if\nit's true, that we--the church--will have to do something about it. You\ncan't let the little fellow grow up surrounded by iron walls. It will\nsurely point him toward the prison. Little minds are tender\nand--ah--impressionable.\"\n\n\"We've had a crib and two pens of wood,\" Mrs. Danner answered tartly.\n\"He smashed them all.\"\n\n\"Ah? So?\" Lifted eyebrows. \"Temper, eh? He should be punished.\nPunishment is the only mould for unruly children.\"\n\n\"You'd punish a six-months-old baby?\"\n\n\"Why--certainly. I've reared seven by the rod.\"\n\n\"Well--\" a blazing maternal instinct made her feel vicious. \"Well--you\nwon't raise mine by a rod. Or touch it--by a mile. Here's your hat,\nparson.\" Mrs. Danner spent the next hour in prayer.\n\nThe village is known for the speed of its gossip and the sloth of its\nintelligence. Those two factors explain the conditions which preluded\nand surrounded the dawn of consciousness in young Hugo. Mrs. Danner's\nextemporaneous fabrication of a sturdy ancestral line kept the more\nsupernatural elements of the baby's prowess from the public eye. It\nbecame rapidly and generally understood that the Danner infant was\nabnormal and that the treatment to which it was submitted was not usual.\nAt the same time neither the gossips of Indian Creek nor the slightly\nmore sage professors of the college exercised the wit necessary to\nrealize that, however strong young Hugo might become, it was neither\nright nor just that his cradle days be augurs of that eventual estate.\nOn the face of it the argument seemed logical. If Mrs. Danner's forbears\nhad been men of peculiar might, her child might well be able to chin\nitself at three weeks and it might easily be necessary to confine it in\na metal pen, however inhumane the process appeared.\n\nHugo was sheltered, and his early antics, peculiar and startling as they\nwere to his parents, escaped public attention. The little current of\ntalk about him was kept alive only because there was so small an array\nof topics for the local burghers. But it was not extraordinarily\nmalicious. Months piled up. A year passed and then another.\n\nHugo was a good-natured, usually sober, and very sensitive child.\nAbednego Danner's fear that his process might have created muscular\nstrength at the expense of reason diminished and vanished as Hugo\nlearned to walk and to talk, and as he grasped the rudiments of human\nbehaviour. His high little voice was heard in the house and about its\nlawns.\n\nThey began to condition him. Throughout his later life there lingered in\nhis mind a memory of the barriers erected by his family. He was told not\nto throw his pillow, when words meant nothing to him. Soon after that,\nhe was told not to throw anything. When he could walk, he was forbidden\nto jump. His jumps were shocking to see, even at the age of two and a\nhalf. He was carefully instructed on his behaviour out of doors. No move\nof his was to indicate his difference from the ordinary child.\n\nHe was taught kindness and respect for people and property. His every\ndestructive impulse was carefully curbed. That training was possible\nonly because he was sensitive and naturally susceptible to advice.\nPunishment had no physical terror for him, because he could not feel it.\nBut disfavour, anger, vexation, or disappointment in another person\nreflected itself in him at once.\n\nWhen he was four and a half, his mother sent him to Sunday school. He\nwas enrolled in a class that sat near her own, so she was able to keep a\ncareful eye on him. But Hugo did not misbehave. It was his first contact\nwith a group of children, his first view of the larger cosmos. He sat\nquietly with his hands folded, as he had been told to sit. He listened\nto the teacher's stories of Jesus with excited interest.\n\nOn his third Sunday he heard one of the children whisper: \"Here comes\nthe strong boy.\"\n\nHe turned quickly, his cheeks red. \"I'm not. I'm not.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. Mother said so.\"\n\nHugo struggled with the two hymn books on the table. \"I can't even lift\nthese books,\" he lied.\n\nThe other child was impressed and tried to explain the situation later,\ntaking the cause of Hugo's weakness against the charge of strength. But\nthe accusation rankled in Hugo's young mind. He hated to be\ndifferent--and he was beginning to realize that he was different.\n\nFrom his earliest day that longing occupied him. He sought to hide his\nstrength. He hated to think that other people were talking about him.\nThe distinction he enjoyed was odious to him because it aroused\nunpleasant emotions in other people. He could not realize that those\nemotions sprang from personal and group jealousy, from the hatred of\nsuperiority.\n\nHis mother, ever zealous to direct her son in the path of righteousness,\ntalked to him often about his strength and how great it would become and\nwhat great and good deeds he could do with it. Those lectures on\nvirtuous crusades had two uses: they helped check any impulses in her\nson which she felt would be harmful to her and they helped her to\nbecome used to the abnormality in little Hugo. In her mind, it was like\ntelling a hunchback that his hump was a blessing disguised. Hugo was\nalways aware of the fact that her words connoted some latent evil in his\nnature.\n\nThe motif grew in Mrs. Danner's thoughts until she sought a definite\noutlet for it. One day she led her child to a keg filled with sand. \"All\nof us,\" she said to her son, \"have to carry a burden through life. One\nof your burdens will be your strength. But that might can make right.\nSee that little keg?\"\n\n\"Mmmmm.\"\n\n\"That keg is temptation. Can you say it?\"\n\n\"Temshun.\"\n\n\"Every day in your life you must bear temptation and throw it from you.\nCan you bear it?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Can you pick up that keg, Hugo?\"\n\nHe lifted it in his chubby arms. \"Now take it to the barn and back,\" his\nmother directed. Manfully he walked with the keg to the barn and back.\nHe felt a little silly and resentful. \"Now--throw temptation as far away\nfrom you as you can.\"\n\nMrs. Danner gasped. The distance he threw the keg was frightening.\n\n\"You musn't throw it so far, Hugo,\" she said, forgetting her allegory\nfor an instant.\n\n\"You said as far as I can. I can throw it farther, too, if I wanna.\"\n\n\"No. Just throw it a little way. When you throw it far, it doesn't look\nright. Now--fill it up with sand, and we'll do it over.\"\n\nHugo was perplexed. A vague wish to weep occupied him as he filled the\nkeg. The lesson was repeated. Mrs. Danner had excellent Sunday-school\ninstincts, even if she had no real comprehension of ethics. Some days\nlater the burden of temptation was exhibited, in all its dramatic\npassages, to Mrs. Nolan and another lady. Again Hugo was resentful and\nagain he felt absurd. When he threw the keg, it broke.\n\n\"My!\" Mrs. Nolan said in a startled tone.\n\n\"How awful!\" the other woman murmured. \"And he's just a child.\"\n\nThat made Hugo suddenly angry and he jumped. The woman screamed. Mrs.\nNolan ran to tell whomever she could find. Mrs. Danner whipped her son\nand he cried softly.\n\nAbednego Danner left the discipline of his son to his wife. He watched\nthe child almost furtively. When Hugo was five, Mr. Danner taught him to\nread. It was a laborious process and required an entire winter. But Hugo\nemerged with a new world open to him--a world which he attacked with\ninterest. No one bothered him when he read. He could be found often on\nsunny days, when other children were playing, prone on the floor,\npuzzling out sentences in the books of the family library and trying to\ncatch their significance. During his fifth year he was not allowed to\nplay with other children. The neighbourhood insisted on that.\n\nWith the busybodyness and contrariness of their kind the same neighbours\ninsisted that Hugo be sent to school in the following fall. When, on the\nopening day, he did not appear, the truant officer called for him. Hugo\nheard the conversation between the officer and his mother. He was\nfrightened. He vowed to himself that his abnormality should be hidden\ndeeply.\n\nAfter that he was dropped into that microcosm of human life to which so\nlittle attention is paid by adults. School frightened and excited Hugo.\nFor one thing, there were girls in school--and Hugo knew nothing about\nthem except that they were different from himself. There were\nteachers--and they made one work, whether one wished to work or not.\nThey represented power, as a jailer represents power. The children\nfeared teachers. Hugo feared them.\n\nBut the lesson of Hugo's first six years was fairly well planted. He\nblushingly ignored the direct questions of those children whom his fame\nhad reached. He gave no reason to anyone for suspecting him of\nabnormality. He became so familiar to his comrades that their curiosity\ngradually vanished. He would not play games with them--his mother had\nforbidden that. But he talked to them and was as friendly as they\nallowed him to be. His sensitiveness and fear of ridicule made him a\nvoracious student. He liked books. He liked to know things and to learn\nthem.\n\nThus, bound by the conditionings of his babyhood, he reached the spring\nof his first year in school without accident. Such tranquillity could\nnot long endure. The day which his mother had dreaded ultimately\narrived. A lanky farmer's son, older than the other children in the\nfirst grade, chose a particularly quiet and balmy recess period to\nplague little Hugo. The farmer's boy was, because of his size, the bully\nand the leader of all the other boys. He had not troubled himself to\nresent Hugo's exclusiveness or Hugo's reputation until that morning when\nhe found himself without occupation. Hugo was sitting in the sun, his\ndark eyes staring a little sadly over the laughing, rioting children.\n\nThe boy approached him. \"Hello, strong man.\" He was shrewd enough to\nmake his voice so loud as to be generally audible. Hugo looked both\nharmless and slightly pathetic.\n\n\"I'm not a strong man.\"\n\n\"Course you're not. But everybody thinks you are--except me. I'm not\nafraid of you.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to be afraid of me. I'm not afraid of you, either.\"\n\n\"Oh, you aren't, huh? Look.\" He touched Hugo's chest with his finger,\nand when Hugo looked down, the boy lifted his finger into Hugo's face.\n\n\"Go away and let me alone.\"\n\nThe tormentor laughed. \"Ever see a fish this long?\"\n\nHis hands indicated a small fish. Involuntarily Hugo looked at them.\nThe hands flew apart and slapped him smartly. Several of the children\nhad stopped their play to watch. The first insult made them giggle. The\nsecond brought a titter from Anna Blake, and Hugo noticed that. Anna\nBlake was a little girl with curly golden hair and blue eyes. Secretly\nHugo admired her and was drawn to her. When she laughed, he felt a\ndismal loneliness, a sudden desertion. The farmer's boy pressed the\noccasion his meanness had made.\n\n\"I'll bet you ain't even strong enough to fight little Charlie Todd.\nCommere, Charlie.\"\n\n\"I am,\" Hugo replied with slow dignity.\n\n\"You're a sissy. You're a-scared to play with us.\"\n\nThe ring around Hugo had grown. He felt a tangible ridicule in it. He\nknew what it was to hate. Still, his inhibitions, his control, held him\nin check. \"Go away,\" he said, \"or I'll hurt you.\"\n\nThe farmer's boy picked up a stick and put it on his shoulder. \"Knock\nthat off, then, strong man.\"\n\nHugo knew the dare and its significance. With a gentle gesture he\nbrushed the stick away. Then the other struck. At the same time he\nkicked Hugo's shins. There was no sense of pain with the kick. Hugo saw\nit as if it had happened to another person. The school-yard tensed with\nexpectation. But the accounts of what followed were garbled. The\nfarmer's boy fell on his face as if by an invisible agency. Then his\nbody was lifted in the air. The children had an awful picture of Hugo\nstanding for a second with the writhing form of his attacker above his\nhead. Then he flung it aside, over the circle that surrounded him, and\nthe body fell with a thud. It lay without moving. Hugo began to whimper\npitifully.\n\nThat was Hugo's first fight. He had defended himself, and it made him\nashamed. He thought he had killed the other boy. Sickening dread filled\nhim. He hurried to his side and shook him, calling his name. The other\nboy came to. His arm was broken and his sides were purpling where Hugo\nhad seized him. There was terror in his eyes when he saw Hugo's face\nabove him, and he screamed shrilly for help. The teacher came. She sent\nHugo to the blacksmith to be whipped.\n\nThat, in itself, was a stroke of genius. The blacksmith whipped grown\nboys in the high school for their misdeeds. To send a six-year-old child\nwas crushing. But Hugo had risen above the standards set by his society.\nHe had been superior to it for a moment, and society hated him for it.\nHis teacher hated him because she feared him. Mothers of children,\nlearning about the episode, collected to discuss it in high-pitched,\nhateful voices. Hugo was enveloped in hate. And, as the lash of the\nsmith fell on his small frame, he felt the depths of misery. He was a\nstrong man. There was damnation in his veins.\n\nThe minister came and prayed over him. The doctor was sent for and\nexamined him. Frantic busybodies suggested that things be done to weaken\nhim--what things, they did not say. And Hugo, suffering bitterly, saw\nthat if he had beaten the farmer's boy in fair combat, he would have\nbeen a hero. It was the scale of his triumph that made it dreadful. He\ndid not realize then that if he had been so minded, he could have turned\non the blacksmith and whipped him, he could have broken the neck of the\ndoctor, he could have run raging through the town and escaped unscathed.\nHis might was a secret from himself. He knew it only as a curse, like a\ndisease or a blemish.\n\nDuring the ensuing four or five years Hugo's peculiar trait asserted\nitself but once. It was a year after his fight with the bully. He had\nbeen isolated socially. Even Anna Blake did not dare to tease him any\nlonger. Shunned and wretched, he built a world of young dreams and\nconfections and lived in it with whatever comfort it afforded.\n\nOne warm afternoon in a smoky Indian summer he walked home from school,\nspinning a top as he walked, stopping every few yards to pick it up and\nto let its eccentric momentum die on the palm of his hand. His pace\nthereby was made very slow and he calculated it to bring him to his home\nin time for supper and no sooner, because, despite his vigour, chores\nwere as odious to him as to any other boy. A wagon drawn by two horses\nrolled toward him. It was a heavy wagon, piled high with grain-sacks,\nand a man sat on its rear end, his legs dangling.\n\nAs the wagon reached Hugo, it jolted over a rut. There was a grinding\nrip and a crash. Hugo pocketed his top and looked. The man sitting on\nthe back had been pinned beneath the rear axle, and the load held him\nthere. As Hugo saw his predicament, the man screamed in agony. Hugo's\nblood chilled. He stood transfixed. A man jumped out of a buggy. A Negro\nran from a yard. Two women hurried from the spot. In an instant there\nwere six or seven men around the broken wagon. A sound of pain issued\nfrom the mouth of the impaled man. The knot of figures bent at the sides\nof the cart and tried to lift. \"Have to get a jack,\" Hugo heard them\nsay.\n\nHugo wound up his string and put it beside his top. He walked\nmechanically into the road. He looked at the legs of the man on the\nground. They were oozing blood where the backboard rested on them. The\nmen gathered there were lifting again, without result. Hugo caught the\nside and bent his small shoulders. With all his might he pulled up. The\nwagon was jerked into the air. They pulled out the injured man. Hugo\nlowered the wagon slowly.\n\nFor a moment no attention was paid to him. He waited pridefully for the\nrecognition he had earned. He dug in the dirt with the side of his shoe.\nA man with a mole on his nose observed him. \"Funny how that kid's\nstrength was just enough to turn the balance.\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"I'm pretty strong,\" he admitted.\n\nAnother man saw him. \"Get out of here,\" he said sharply. \"This is no\nplace for a kid.\"\n\n\"But I was the one--\"\n\n\"I said beat it. And I meant beat it. Go home to your ma.\"\n\nSlowly the light went from Hugo's eyes. They did not know--they could\nnot know. He had lifted more than two tons. And the men stood now,\nwaiting for the doctor, telling each other how strong they were when the\ninstant of need came.\n\n\"Go on, kid. Run along. I'll smack you.\"\n\nHugo went. He forgot to spin his top. He stumbled a little as he\nwalked.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nDays, months, years. They had forgotten that Hugo was different. Almost,\nfor a while, he had forgotten it himself. He was popular in school. He\nfostered the unexpressed theory that his strength had been a phenomenon\nof his childhood--one that diminished as he grew older. Then, at ten, it\ncalled to him for exercise.\n\nEach day he rose with a feeling of insufficiency. Each night he retired\nunrequited. He read. Poe, the Bible, Scott, Thackeray, Swift, Defoe--all\nthe books he could find. He thrilled with every syllable of adventure.\nHis imagination swelled. But that was not sufficient. He yearned as a\nNew England boy yearns before he runs away to sea.\n\nAt ten he was a stalwart and handsome lad. His brow was high and\nsurmounted by his peculiarly black hair. His eyes were wide apart, inky,\nunfathomable. He carried himself with the grace of an athlete. He\nstudied hard and he worked hard for his parents, taking care of a cow\nand chickens, of a stable and a large lawn, of flowers and a vegetable\ngarden.\n\nThen one day he went by himself to walk in the mountains. He had not\nbeen allowed to go into the mountains alone. A _Wanderlust_ that came\nhalf from himself and half from his books led his feet along a narrow,\nleafy trail into the forest depths. Hugo lay down and listened to the\nbirds in the bushes, to the music of a brook, and to the sound of the\nwind. He wanted to be free and brave and great. By and by he stood up\nand walked again.\n\nAn easy exhilaration filled his veins. His pace increased. \"I wonder,\"\nhe thought, \"how fast I can run, how far I can jump.\" He quickened his\nstride. In a moment he found that the turns in the trail were too\nfrequent for him to see his course. He ran ahead, realizing that he was\nmoving at an abnormal pace. Then he turned, gathered himself, and jumped\ncarefully. He was astonished when he vaulted above the green covering of\nthe trail. He came down heavily. He stood in his tracks, tingling.\n\n\"Nobody can do that, not even an acrobat,\" he whispered. Again he tried,\njumping straight up. He rose fully forty feet in the air.\n\n\"Good Jesus!\" he exulted. In those lonely, incredible moments Hugo found\nhimself. There in the forest, beyond the eye of man, he learned that he\nwas superhuman. It was a rapturous discovery. He knew at that hour that\nhis strength was not a curse. He had inklings of his invulnerability.\n\nHe ran. He shot up the steep trail like an express train, at a rate that\nwould have been measured in miles to the hour rather than yards to the\nminute. Tireless blood poured through his veins. Green streaked at his\nsides. In a short time he came to the end of the trail. He plunged on,\ncareless of obstacles that would have stopped an ordinary mortal. From\ntrunk to trunk he leaped a burned stretch. He flung himself from a high\nrock. He sped like a shadow across a pine-carpeted knoll. He gained the\nbare rocks of the first mountain, and in the open, where the horror of\nno eye would tether his strength, he moved in flying bounds to its\nsummit.\n\nHugo stood there, panting. Below him was the world. A little world. He\nlaughed. His dreams had been broken open. His depression was relieved.\nBut he would never let them know--he, Hugo, the giant. Except, perhaps,\nhis father. He lifted his arms--to thank God, to jeer at the world. Hugo\nwas happy.\n\nHe went home wondering. He was very hungry--hungrier than he had ever\nbeen--and his parents watched him eat with hidden glances. Samson had\neaten thus, as if his stomach were bottomless and his food digested\ninstantly to make room for more. And, as he ate, Hugo tried to open a\nconversation that would lead to a confession to his father. But it\nseemed impossible.\n\nHugo liked his father. He saw how his mother dominated the little\nprofessor, how she seemed to have crushed and bewildered him until his\nmind was unfocused from its present. He could not love his mother\nbecause of that. He did not reason that her religion had made her blind\nand selfish, but he felt her blindness and the many cloaks that\nprotected her and her interests. He held her in respect and he obeyed\nher. But often and wistfully he had tried to talk to his father, to make\nfriends with him, to make himself felt as a person.\n\nAbednego Danner's mind was buried in the work he had done. His son was a\nforeign person for whom he felt a perplexed sympathy. It is significant\nthat he had never talked to Hugo about Hugo's prowess. The ten-year-old\nboy had not wished to discuss it. Now, however, realizing its extent, he\nfelt he must go to his father. After dinner he said: \"Dad, let's you and\nme take a walk.\"\n\nMrs. Danner's protective impulses functioned automatically. \"Not\nto-night. I won't have it.\"\n\n\"But, mother--\"\n\nDanner guessed the reason for that walk. He said to his wife with rare\nfirmness: \"If the boy wants to walk with me, we're going.\"\n\nAfter supper they went out. Mrs. Danner felt that she had been shut out\nof her own son's world. And she realized that he was growing up.\n\nDanner and his son strolled along the leafy street. They talked about\nhis work in school. His father seemed to Hugo more human than he had\never been. He even ventured the first step toward other conversation.\n\"Well, son, what is it?\"\n\nHugo caught his breath. \"Well--I kind of thought I ought to tell you.\nYou see--this afternoon--well--you know I've always been a sort of\nstrong kid--\"\n\nDanner trembled. \"I know--\"\n\n\"And you haven't said much about it to me. Except to be gentle--\"\n\n\"That's so. You must remember it.\"\n\n\"Well--I don't have to be gentle with myself, do I? When I'm alone--like\nin the woods, that is?\"\n\nThe older one pondered. \"You mean--you like to--ah--let yourself\nout--when you're alone?\"\n\n\"That's what I mean.\" The usual constraint between them had receded.\nHugo was grateful for his father's help. \"You see, dad, I--well--I went\nwalkin' to-day--and I--I kind of tried myself out.\"\n\nDanner answered in breathless eagerness: \"And?\"\n\n\"Well--I'm not just a strong kid, dad. I don't know what's the matter\nwith me. It seems I'm not like other kids at all. I guess it's been\ngettin' worse all these years since I was a baby.\"\n\n\"Worse?\"\n\n\"I mean--I been gettin' stronger. An' now it seems like I'm\nabout--well--I don't like to boast--but it seems like I'm about the\nstrongest man in the world. When I try it, it seems like there isn't any\nstopping me. I can go on--far as I like. Runnin'. Jumpin'.\" His\nconfession had commenced in detail. Hugo warmed to it. \"I can do things,\ndad. It kind of scares me. I can jump higher'n a house. I can run\nfaster'n a train. I can pull up big trees an' push 'em over.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Danner's spine tingled. He worshipped his son then. \"Suppose\nyou show me.\"\n\nHugo looked up and down the street. There was no one in sight. The\nevening was still duskily lighted by afterglow. \"Look out then. I'm\ngonna jump.\"\n\nMr. Danner saw his son crouch. But he jumped so quickly that he\nvanished. Four seconds elapsed. He landed where he had stood. \"See,\ndad?\"\n\n\"Do it again.\"\n\nOn the second trial the professor's eyes followed the soaring form. And\nhe realized the magnitude of the thing he had wrought.\n\n\"Did you see me?\"\n\nDanner nodded. \"I saw you, son.\"\n\n\"Kind of funny, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Let's talk some more.\" There was a pause. \"Do you realize, son, that no\none else on earth can do what you just did?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I guess not.\"\n\nDanner hesitated. \"It's a glorious thing. And dangerous.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nThe professor tried to simplify the biology of his discovery. He\nperceived that it was going to involve him in the mysteries of sex. He\nknew that to unfold them to a child was considered immoral. But Danner\nwas far, far beyond his epoch. He put his hand on Hugo's shoulder. And\nHugo set off the process.\n\n\"Dad, how come I'm--like this?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. It's a long story and a lot for a boy your age to know.\nFirst, what do you know about--well--about how you were born?\"\n\nHugo reddened. \"I--I guess I know quite a bit. The kids in school are\nalways talkin' about it. And I've read some. We're born like--well--like\nthe kittens were born last year.\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Banner knitted his brow. He began to explain the details\nof conception as it occurs in man--the biology of ova and spermatazoa,\nthe differences between the anatomy of the sexes, and the reasons for\nthose differences. He drew, first, a botanical analogy. Hugo listened\nintently. \"I knew most of that. I've seen--girls.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Some of them--after school--let you.\"\n\nDanner was surprised, and at the same time he was amused. He had\nforgotten the details of his young investigation. They are blotted out\nof the minds of most adults--to the great advantage of dignity. He did\nnot show his amusement or his surprise.\n\n\"Girls like that,\" he answered, \"aren't very nice. They haven't much\nmodesty. It's rather indecent, because sex is a personal thing and\nsomething you ought to keep for the one you're very fond of. You'll\nunderstand that better when you're older. But what I was going to tell\nyou is this. When you were little more than a mass of plasm inside your\nmother, I put a medicine in her blood that I had discovered. I did it\nwith a hypodermic needle. That medicine changed you. It altered the\nstructure of your bones and muscles and nerves and your blood. It made\nyou into a different tissue from the weak fibre of ordinary people.\nThen--when you were born--you were strong. Did you ever watch an ant\ncarry many times its weight? Or see a grasshopper jump fifty times its\nlength? The insects have better muscles and nerves than we have. And I\nimproved your body till it was relatively that strong. Can you\nunderstand that?\"\n\n\"Sure. I'm like a man made out of iron instead of meat.\"\n\n\"That's it, Hugo. And, as you grow up, you've got to remember that.\nYou're not an ordinary human being. When people find that out,\nthey'll--they'll--\"\n\n\"They'll hate me?\"\n\n\"Because they fear you. So you see, you've got to be good and kind and\nconsiderate--to justify all that strength. Some day you'll find a use\nfor it--a big, noble use--and then you can make it work and be proud of\nit. Until that day, you have to be humble like all the rest of us. You\nmustn't show off or do cheap tricks. Then you'd just be a clown. Wait\nyour time, son, and you'll be glad of it. And--another thing--train your\ntemper. You must never lose it. You can see what would happen if you\ndid? Understand?\"\n\n\"I guess I do. It's hard work--doin' all that.\"\n\n\"The stronger, the greater, you are, the harder life is for you. And\nyou're the strongest of them all, Hugo.\"\n\nThe heart of the ten-year-old boy burned and vibrated. \"And what about\nGod?\" he asked.\n\nDanner looked into the darkened sky. \"I don't know much about Him,\" he\nsighed.\n\nSuch was the soundest counsel that Hugo was given during his youth.\nBecause it came to him accompanied by unadulterated truths that he was\nable to recognize, it exerted a profound effect on him. It is surprising\nthat his father was the one to give it. Nevertheless, Professor Danner\nwas the only person in all of Indian Creek who had sufficient\nimagination to perceive his son's problems and to reckon with them in\nany practical sense.\n\nHugo was eighteen before he gave any other indication of his strength\nsave in that fantastic and Gargantuan play which he permitted himself.\nEven his play was intruded upon by the small-minded and curious world\nbefore he had found the completeness of its pleasure. Then Hugo fell\ninto his coma.\n\nHugo went back to the deep forest to think things over and to become\nacquainted with his powers. At first, under full pressure of his sinews,\nhe was clumsy and inaccurate. He learned deftness by trial and error.\nOne day he found a huge pit in the tangled wilderness. It had been an\nopen mine long years before. Sitting on its brink, staring into its pool\nof verdure, dreaming, he conceived a manner of entertainment suitable\nfor his powers.\n\nHe jumped over its craggy edge and walked to its centre. There he\nselected a high place, and with his hands he cleared away the growth\nthat covered it. Next he laid the foundations of a fort, over which he\nwas to watch the fastnesses for imaginary enemies. The foundations were\nmade of boulders. Some he carried and some he rolled from the floor of\nthe man-made canyon. By the end of the afternoon he had laid out a\nsquare wall of rock some three feet in height. On the next day he added\nto it until the four walls reached as high as he could stretch. He left\nspace for one door and he made a single window. He roofed the walls with\nthe trunks of trees and he erected a turret over the door.\n\nFor days the creation was his delight. After school he sped to it. Until\ndark he strained and struggled with bare rocks. When it was finished, it\nwas an edifice that would have withstood artillery fire creditably. Then\nHugo experimented with catapults, but he found no engine that could hurl\nthe rocks he used for ammunition as far as his arms. He cached his\ntreasures in his fortress--an old axe, the scabbard of a sword, tops and\nmarbles, two cans of beans for emergency rations--and he made a flag of\nblue and white cloth for himself.\n\nThen he played in it. He pretended that Indians were stalking him. An\nimaginary head would appear at the rim of the pit. Hugo would see it\nthrough a chink. Swish! Crash! A puff of dust would show where rock met\nrock--with the attacker's head between. At times he would be stormed on\nall sides. To get the effect he would leap the canyon and hurl boulders\non his own fort. Then he would return and defend it.\n\nIt was after such a strenuous sally and while he was waiting in high\nexcitement for the enemy to reappear that Professors Whitaker and Smith\nfrom the college stumbled on his stronghold. They were walking together\nthrough the forest, bent on scaling the mountain to make certain\nobservations of an ancient cirque that was formed by the seventh great\nglacier. As they walked, they debated matters of strata curvature.\nSuddenly Whitaker gripped Smith's arm. \"Look!\"\n\nThey stared through the trees and over the lip of Hugo's mine. Their\neyes bulged as they observed the size and weight of the fortress.\n\n\"Moonshiners,\" Smith whispered.\n\n\"Rubbish. Moonshiners don't build like that. It's a second Stonehenge.\nAn Indian relic.\"\n\n\"But there's a sign of fresh work around it.\"\n\nWhitaker observed the newly turned earth and the freshly bared rock.\n\"Perhaps--perhaps, professor, we've fallen upon something big. A lost\nrace of Indian engineers. A branch of the Incas--or--\"\n\n\"Maybe they'll be hostile.\"\n\nThe men edged forward. And at the moment they reached the edge of the\npit, Hugo emerged from his fort. He saw the men with sudden fear. He\ntried to hide.\n\n\"Hey!\" they said. He did not move, but he heard them scrambling slowly\ntoward the spot where he lay.\n\n\"Dressed in civilized clothes,\" the first professor said in a loud voice\nas his eye located Hugo in the underbrush. \"Hey!\"\n\nHugo showed himself. \"What?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Hugo Danner.\"\n\n\"Oh--old Danner's boy, eh?\"\n\nHugo did not like the tone in which they referred to his father. He made\nno reply.\n\n\"Can you tell us anything about these ruins?\"\n\n\"What ruins?\"\n\nThey pointed to his fort. Hugo was hurt. \"Those aren't ruins. I built\nthat fort. It's to fight Indians in.\"\n\nThe pair ignored his answer and started toward the fort. Hugo did not\nprotest. They surveyed its weighty walls and its relatively new roof.\n\n\"Looks recent,\" Smith said.\n\n\"This child has evidently renovated it. But it must have stood here for\nthousands of years.\"\n\n\"It didn't. I made it--mostly last week.\"\n\nThey noticed him again. Whitaker simpered. \"Don't lie, young man.\"\n\nHugo was sad. \"I'm not lying. I made it. You see--I'm strong.\" It was as\nif he had pronounced his own damnation.\n\n\"Tut, tut.\" Smith interrupted his survey. \"Did you find it?\"\n\n\"I built it.\"\n\n\"I said\"--the professor spoke with increasing annoyance--\"I said not to\ntell me stories any longer. It's important, young man, that we know just\nhow you found this dolmen and in what condition.\"\n\n\"It isn't a dolly--whatever you said--it's a fort and I built it and I'm\nnot lying.\"\n\nThe professor, in the interests of science, made a grave mistake. He\nseized Hugo by the arms and shook him. \"Now, see here, young man, I'll\nhave no more of your impertinent lip. Tell me just what you've done to\nharm this noble monument to another race, or, I swear, I'll slap you\nproperly.\" The professor had no children. He tried, at the same time,\nanother tack, which insulted Hugo further. \"If you do, I'll give you a\npenny--to keep.\"\n\nHugo wrenched himself free with an ease that startled Smith. His face\nwas dark, almost black. He spoke slowly, as if he was trying to piece\nwords into sense. \"You--both of you--you go away from here and leave me\nor I'll break your two rotten old necks.\"\n\nWhitaker moved toward him, and Smith interceded. \"We better leave\nhim--and come back later.\" He was still frightened by the strength in\nHugo's arms. \"The child is mad. He may have hydrophobia. He might bite.\"\nThe men moved away hastily. Hugo watched them climb the wall. When they\nreached the top, he called gently. They wheeled.\n\nAnd Hugo, sobbing, tears streaming from his face, leaped into his fort.\nRocks vomited themselves from it--huge rocks that no man could budge.\nWalls toppled and crashed. The men began to move. Hugo looked up. He\nchose a stone that weighed more than a hundred pounds.\n\n\"Hey!\" he said. \"I'm not a liar!\" The rock arched through the air and\nProfessors Whitaker and Smith escaped death by a scant margin. Hugo lay\nin the wreck of the first thing his hands had built, and wept.\n\nAfter a little while he sprang to his feet and chased the retreating\nprofessors. When he suddenly appeared in front of them, they were\nstricken dumb. \"Don't tell any one about that or about me,\" he said. \"If\nyou do--I'll break down your house just like I broke mine. Don't even\ntell my family. They know it, anyhow.\"\n\nHe leaped. Toward them--over them. The forest hid him. Whitaker wiped\nclammy perspiration from his brow. \"What was it, Smith?\"\n\n\"A demon. We can't mention it,\" he repeated, thinking of the warning.\n\"We can't speak of it anyway. They'll never believe us.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nExtremely dark of hair, of eyes and skin, moderately tall, and shaped\nwith that compact, breath-taking symmetry that the male figure sometimes\nassumes, a brilliantly devised, aggressive head topping his broad\nshoulders, graceful, a man vehemently alive, a man with the promise of a\nyoung God. Hugo at eighteen. His emotions ran through his eyes like hot\nsteel in a dark mould. People avoided those eyes; they contained a\nstatement from which ordinary souls shrank.\n\nHis skin glowed and sweated into a shiny red-brown. His voice was deep\nand alluring. During twelve long and fierce years he had fought to know\nand control himself. Indian Creek had forgotten the terrible child.\n\nHugo's life at that time revolved less about himself than it had during\nhis first years. That was both natural and fortunate. If his classmates\nin school and the older people of the town had not discounted his early\nphysical precocity, even his splendid vitality might not have been\nsufficient to prevent him from becoming moody and melancholy.\n\nBut when with the passage of time he tossed no more bullies, carried no\nmore barrels of temptation, built no more fortresses, and grew so\nhandsome that the matrons of Indian Creek as well as the adolescent\ngirls in high school followed him with wayward glances, when the men\nfound him a gay and comprehending companion for any sport or adventure,\nwhen his teachers observed that his intelligence was often\nembarrassingly acute, when he played on three teams and was elected an\nofficer in his classes each year, then that half of Hugo which was\npurely mundane and human dominated him and made him happy.\n\nHis adolescence, his emotions, were no different from those of any young\nman of his age and character. If his ultimate ambitions followed another\ntrajectory, he postponed the evidence of it. Hugo was in love with Anna\nBlake, the girl who had attracted him when he was six. The residents of\nIndian Creek knew it. Her family received his calls with the winking\ntolerance which the middle class grants to young passion. And she was\nwarm and tender and flirtatious and shy according to the policies that\nshe had learned from custom.\n\nThe active part of Hugo did not doubt that he would marry her after he\nhad graduated from the college in Indian Creek, that they would settle\nsomewhere near by, and that they would raise a number of children. His\nsubconscious thoughts made reservations that he, in moments when he was\nintimate with himself, would admit frankly. It made him a little ashamed\nof himself to see that on one night he would sit with Anna and kiss her\nardently until his body ached, and on another he would deliberately plan\nto desert her. His idealism at that time was very great and untried and\nit did not occur to him that all men are so deliberately calculating in\nthe love they disguise as absolute.\n\nAnna had grown into a very attractive woman. Her figure was rounded and\ntall. Her hair was darker than the waxy curls of her childhood, and a\nvital gleam had come into it. Her eyes were still as blue and her voice,\nshorn of its faltering youngness, was sweet and clear. She was\nundoubtedly the prettiest girl in high school and the logical\nsweet-heart for Hugo Danner. A flower ready to be plucked, at eighteen.\n\nWhen Hugo reached his senior year, that readiness became almost an\nimpatience. Girls married at an early age in Indian Creek. She looked\ndown the corridor of time during which he would be in college, she felt\nthe pressure of his still slumbering passion, and she sensed his\nsuperiority over most of the town boys. Only a very narrow critic would\ncall her resultant tactics dishonourable. They were too intensely human\nand too clearly born of social and biological necessity.\n\nShe had let him kiss her when they were sixteen. And afterwards, before\nshe went to sleep, she sighed rapturously at the memory of his warm,\nfirm lips, his strong, rough arms. Hugo had gone home through the\ndizzily spinning dusk, through the wind-strummed trees and the fragrant\nfields, his breath deep in his chest, his eyes hot and somewhat\nunderstanding.\n\nGradually Anna increased that license. She knew and she did not know\nwhat she was doing. She played a long game in which she said: \"If our\nlove is consummated too soon, the social loss will be balanced by a\nspeedier marriage, because Hugo is honourable; but that will never\nhappen.\" Two years after that first kiss, when they were floating on the\nnarrow river in a canoe, Hugo unfastened her blouse and exposed the\ncreamy beauty of her bosom to the soft moonlight and she did not\nprotest. That night he nearly possessed her, and after that night he\nlearned through her unspoken, voluptuous suggestion all the technique of\nlove-making this side of consummation.\n\nWhen, finally, he called one night at her house and found that she was\nalone and that her parents and her brother would not return until the\nnext day, they looked at each other with a shining agreement. He turned\nthe lights out and they sat on the couch in the darkness, listening to\nthe passing of people on the sidewalk outside. He undressed her. He\nwhispered halting, passionate phrases. He asked her if she was afraid\nand let himself be laughed away from his own conscience. Then he took\nher and loved her.\n\nAfterwards, going home again in the gloom of late night, he looked up at\nthe stars and they stood still. He realized that a certain path of life\nhad been followed to its conclusion. He felt initiated into the adult\nworld. And it had been so simple, so natural, so sweet.... He threw a\ngreat stone into the river and laughed and walked on, after a while.\n\nThrough the summer that followed, Hugo and Anna ran the course of their\naffair. They loved each other violently and incessantly and with no\nother evil consequence than to invite the open \"humphs\" of village\ngossips and to involve him in several serious talks with her father.\nTheir courtship was given the benefit of conventional doubt, however,\nand their innocence was hotly if covertly protested by the Blakes. Mrs.\nDanner coldly ignored every fragment of insinuation. She hoped that Hugo\nand Anna would announce their engagement and she hinted that hope. Hugo\nhimself was excited and absorbed. Occasionally he thought he was\nsterile, with an inclination to be pleased rather than concerned if it\nwas true.\n\nHe added tenderness to his characteristics. And he loved Anna too much.\nToward the end of that summer she lost weight and became irritable. They\nquarrelled once and then again. The criteria for his physical conduct\nbeing vague in his mind, Hugo could not gauge it correctly. And he did\nnot realize that the very ardour of his relation with her was abnormal.\nHer family decided to send her away, believing the opposite of the truth\nresponsible for her nervousness and weakness. A week before she left,\nHugo himself tired of his excesses.\n\nOne evening, dressing for a last passionate rendezvous, he looked in his\nmirror as he tied his scarf and saw that he was frowning. Studying the\nfrown, he perceived with a shock what made it. He did not want to see\nAnna, to take her out, to kiss and rumple and clasp her, to return\nthinking of her, feeling her, sweet and smelling like her. It annoyed\nhim. It bored him. He went through it uneasily and quarrelled again. Two\ndays later she departed.\n\nHe acted his loss well and she did not show her relief until she sat on\nthe train, tired, shattered, and uninterested in Hugo and in life. Then\nshe cried. But Hugo was through. They exchanged insincere letters. He\nlooked forward to college in the fall. Then he received a letter from\nAnna saying that she was going to marry a man she had met and known for\nthree weeks. It was a broken, gasping, apologetic letter. Every one was\noutraged at Anna and astounded that Hugo bore the shock so courageously.\n\nThe upshot of that summer was to fill his mind with fetid memories,\nwhich abated slowly, to make him disgusted with himself and tired of\nIndian Creek. He decided to go to a different college, one far away from\nthe scene of his painful youth and his disillusioned maturity. He chose\nWebster University because of the greatness of its name. If Abednego\nDanner was hurt at his son's defection from his own college, he said\nnothing. And Mrs. Danner, grown more silent and reserved, yielded to her\nson's unexpected decision.\n\nHugo packed his bags one September afternoon, with a feeling of\ndreaminess. He bade farewell to his family. He boarded the train. His\nmind was opaque. The spark burning in it was one of dawning adventure\nburied in a mass of detail. He had never been far from his native soil.\nNow he was going to see cities and people who were almost foreign, in\nthe sophisticated East. But all he could dwell on was a swift cinema of\na defeated little boy, a strong man who could never be strong, a\nsurfeited love, a truant and dimly comprehensible blonde girl, a muddy\nstreet and a red station, a clapboard house, a sonorous church with\nhushed puppets in the pews, fudge parties, boats on the little river,\ncold winter, and ice over the mountains, and a fortress where once upon\na time he had felt mightier than the universe.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThe short branch line to which Hugo changed brought him to the fringe of\nthe campus. The cars were full of boys, so many of them that he was\nembarrassed. They all appeared to know each other, and no one spoke to\nhim. His dreams on the train were culminated. He had decided to become a\ngreat athlete. With his mind's eye, he played the football he would\nplay--and the baseball. Ninety-yard runs, homers hit over the fence into\noblivion. Seeing the boys and feeling their lack of notice of him\nredoubled the force of that decision. Then he stepped on to the station\nplatform and stood facing the campus. He could not escape a rush of\nreverence and of awe; it was so wide, so green and beautiful. Far away\ntowered the giant arches of the stadium. Near by were the sharp Gothic\npoints of the chapel and the graduate college. Between them a score or\nmore of buildings rambled in and out through the trees.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nHugo turned a little self-consciously. A youth in a white shirt and\nwhite trousers was beckoning to him. \"Freshman, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. My name's Danner. Hugo Danner.\"\n\n\"I'm Lefty Foresman. Chuck!\" A second student separated himself from the\nbustle of baggage and young men. \"Here's a freshman.\"\n\nHugo waited with some embarrassment. He wondered why they wanted a\nfreshman. Lefty introduced Chuck and then said: \"Are you strong,\nfreshman?\"\n\nFor an instant he was stunned. Had they heard, guessed? Then he realized\nit was impossible. They wanted him to work. They were going to haze him.\n\"Sure,\" he said.\n\n\"Then get this trunk and I'll show you where to take it.\"\n\nHugo was handed a baggage check. He found the official and located the\ntrunk. Tentatively he tested its weight, as if he were a normally husky\nyouth about to undertake its transportation. He felt pleased that his\nstrength was going to be tried so accidentally and in such short order.\nLefty and Chuck heaved the trunk on his back. \"Can you carry it?\" they\nasked.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure. It's a long way.\"\n\nPeering from beneath the trunk under which he bent with a fair\nassumption of human weakness, Hugo had his first close glimpse of\nWebster. They passed under a huge arch and down a street lined with\nelms. Students were everywhere, carrying books and furniture, moving in\nwheelbarrows and moving by means of the backs of other freshmen. The two\nwho led him were talking and he listened as he plodded.\n\n\"Saw Marcia just before I left the lake--took her out one night--and got\nall over the place with her--and then came down--she's coming to the\nfirst prom with me--and Marj to the second--got to get some beer\nin--we'll buzz out and see if old Snorenson has made any wine this\nsummer. Hello, Eddie--glad to see you back--I've elected the dean's\nphysics, though, God knows, I'll never get a first in them and I need it\nfor a key. That damn Frosh we picked up sure must have been a\nporter--hey, freshmen! Want a rest?\"\n\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\n\"Went down to the field this afternoon--looks all right to me. The team,\nthat is. Billings is going to quarter it now--and me after that--hope to\nChrist I make it--they're going to have Scapper and Dwan back at Yale\nand we've got a lot of work to do. Frosh! You don't need to drag that\nall the way in one yank. Put it down, will you?\"\n\n\"I'm not tired. I don't need a rest.\"\n\n\"Well, you know best--but you ought to be tired. I would. Where do you\ncome from?\"\n\n\"Colorado.\"\n\n\"Huh! People go to Colorado. Never heard of any one coming from there\nbefore. Whereabouts?\"\n\n\"Indian Creek.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" There was a pause. \"You aren't an Indian, are you?\" It was asked\nbluntly.\n\n\"Scotch Presbyterian for twenty generations.\"\n\n\"Well, when you get through here, you'll be full of Scotch and emptied\nof the Presbyterianism. Put the trunk down.\"\n\nTheir talk of women, of classes, of football, excited Hugo. He was not\nquite as amazed to find that Lefty Foresman was one of the candidates\nfor the football team as he might have been later when he knew how many\nstudents attended the university and how few, relatively, were athletes.\nHe decided at once that he liked Lefty. The sophistication of his talk\nwas unfamiliar to Hugo; much of it he could not understand and only\nguessed. He wanted Lefty to notice him. When he was told to put the\ntrunk down, he did not obey. Instead, with precision and ease, he swung\nit up on his shoulder, held it with one hand and said in an unflustered\ntone: \"I'm not tired, honestly. Where do we go from here?\"\n\n\"Great howling Jesus!\" Lefty said, \"what have we here? Hey! Put that\ntrunk down.\" There was excitement in his voice. \"Say, guy, do that\nagain.\"\n\nHugo did it. Lefty squeezed his biceps and grew pale. Those muscles in\naction lost their feel of flesh and became like stone. Lefty said: \"Say,\nboy, can you play football?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Hugo said.\n\n\"Well, you leave that trunk with Chuck, here, and come with me.\"\n\nHugo did as he had been ordered and they walked side by side to the\ngymnasium. Hugo had once seen a small gymnasium, ill equipped and badly\nlighted, and it had appealed mightily to him. Now he stood in a\nprodigious vaulted room with a shimmering floor, a circular balcony, a\nvaried array of apparatus. His hands clenched. Lefty quit him for a\nmoment and came back with a man who wore knickers. \"Mr. Woodman, this\nis--what the hell's your name?\"\n\n\"Danner. Hugo Danner.\"\n\n\"Mr. Woodman is football coach.\"\n\nHugo took the man's hand. Lefty excused himself. Mr. Woodman said:\n\"Young Foresman said you played football.\"\n\n\"Just on a high-school team in Colorado.\"\n\n\"Said you were husky. Go in my office and ask Fitzsimmons to give you a\ngym suit. Come out when you're ready.\"\n\nHugo undressed and put on the suit. Fitzsimmons, the trainer, looked at\nhim with warm admiration. \"You're sure built, son.\"\n\n\"Yeah. That's luck, isn't it?\"\n\nThen Hugo was taken to another office. Woodman asked him a number of\nquestions about his weight, his health, his past medical history. He\nlistened to Hugo's heart and then led him to a scale. Hugo had lied\nabout his weight.\n\n\"I thought you said one hundred and sixty, Mr. Danner?\"\n\nThe scales showed two hundred and eleven, but it was impossible for a\nman of his size and build to weigh that much. Hugo had lied\ndeliberately, hoping that he could avoid the embarrassment of being\nweighed. \"I did, Mr. Woodman. You see--my weight is a sort of freak. I\ndon't show it--no one would believe it--and yet there it is.\" He did not\ngo into the details of his construction from a plasm new to biology.\n\n\"Huh!\" Mr. Woodman said. Together they walked out on the floor of the\ngymnasium. Woodman called to one of the figures on the track who was\nmaking slow, plodding circuits. \"Hey, Nellie! Take this bird up and pace\nhim for a lap. Make it fast.\"\n\nA little smile came at the corners of Hugo's mouth. Several of the men\nin the gymnasium stopped work to watch the trial of what was evidently a\nnew candidate. \"Ready?\" Woodman said, and the runners crouched side by\nside. \"Set? Go!\"\n\nNelson, one of the best sprinters Webster had had for years, dashed\nforward. He had covered thirty feet when he heard a voice almost in his\near. \"Faster, old man.\"\n\nNelson increased. \"Faster, boy, I'm passing you.\" The words were spoken\nquietly, calmly. A rage filled Nelson. He let every ounce of his\nstrength into his limbs and skimmed the canvas. Half a lap. Hugo ran at\nhis side and Nelson could not lead him. The remaining half was not a\nrace. Hugo finished thirty feet in the lead.\n\nWoodman, standing on the floor, wiped his forehead and bawled: \"That the\nbest you can do, Nellie?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What in hell have you been doing to yourself?\"\n\nNelson drew a sobbing breath. \"I--haven't--done--a thing. Time--that\nman. He's--faster than the intercollegiate mark.\"\n\nWoodman, still dubious, made Hugo run against time. And Hugo, eager to\nmake an impression and unguided by a human runner, broke the world's\nrecord for the distance around the track by a second and three-fifths.\nThe watch in Woodman's hands trembled.\n\n\"Hey!\" he said, uncertain of his voice, \"come down here, will you?\"\n\nHugo descended the spiral iron staircase. He was breathing with ease.\nWoodman stared at him. \"Lessee you jump.\"\n\nHugo was familiar with the distances for jumping made in track meets. He\nwas careful not to overdo his effort. His running jump was twenty-eight\nfeet, and his standing jump was eleven feet and some inches. Woodman's\nface ran water. His eyes gleamed. \"Danner,\" he said, \"where did you get\nthat way?\"\n\n\"What way?\"\n\n\"I mean--what have you done all your life?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Gone to school.\"\n\n\"Two hundred and eleven pounds,\" Woodman muttered, \"run like an Olympic\nchamp--jump like a kangaroo--how's your kicking?\"\n\n\"All right, I guess.\"\n\n\"Passing?\"\n\n\"All right, I guess.\"\n\n\"Come on outside. Hey, Fitz! Bring a ball.\"\n\nAn hour later Fitzsimmons found Woodman sitting in his office. Beside\nhim was a bottle of whisky which he kept to revive wounded gladiators.\n\"Fitz,\" said Woodman, looking at the trainer with dazed eyes, \"did you\nsee what I saw?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, Woodie.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it.\"\n\nFitzsimmons scratched his greying head. \"Well, Woodie, I seen a young\nman--\"\n\n\"Saw, Fitz.\"\n\n\"I saw a young man come into the gym an' undress. He looked like an\noiled steam engine. I saw him go and knock hell out of three track\nrecords without even losing his breath. Then I seen him go out on the\nfield an' kick a football from one end to the other an' pass it back.\nThat's what _I_ seen.\"\n\nWoodman nodded his head. \"So did I. But I don't believe it, do you?\"\n\n\"I do. That's the man you--an' all the other coaches--have been wantin'\nto see. The perfect athlete. Better in everything than the best man at\nany one thing. Just a freak, Woodie--but, God Almighty, how New Haven\nan' Colgate are goin' to feel it these next years!\"\n\n\"Mebbe he's dumb, Fitz.\"\n\n\"Mebbe. Mebbe not.\"\n\n\"Find out.\"\n\nFitz wasted no time. He telephoned to the registrar's office. \"Mr. H.\nDanner,\" said the voice of a secretary, \"passed his examinations with\nthe highest honours and was admitted among the first ten.\"\n\n\"He passed his entrance exams among the first ten,\" Fitzsimmons\nrepeated.\n\n\"God!\" said Woodman, \"it's the millennium!\" And he took a drink.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLate in the afternoon of that day Hugo found his room in Thompson\nDormitory. He unpacked his carpet-bag and his straw suitcase. He checked\nin his mind the things that he had done. It seemed a great deal for one\nday--a complete alteration of his life. He had seen the dean and\narranged his classes: trigonometry, English, French, Latin, biology,\nphysics, economics, hygiene. With a pencil and a ruler he made a\nschedule, which he pinned on the second-hand desk he had bought.\n\nThen he checked his furniture: a desk, two chairs, a bed, bed-clothes, a\nrug, sheets and blankets, towels. He hung his clothes in the closet. For\na while he looked at them attentively. They were not like the clothes of\nthe other students. He could not quite perceive the difference, but he\nfelt it, and it made him uncomfortable. The room to which he had been\nassigned was pleasant. It looked over the rolling campus on two sides,\nand both windows were framed in the leaves of nodding ivy.\n\nIt was growing dark. From a dormitory near by came the music of a banjo.\nPresently the player sang and other voices joined with him. A warm and\ngolden sun touched the high clouds with lingering fire. Voices cried\nout, young and vigorous. Hugo sighed. He was going to be happy at\nWebster. His greatness was going to be born here.\n\nAt that time Woodman called informally on Chuck and Lefty. They were in\na heated argument over the decorative arrangement of various liquor\nbottles when he knocked. \"Come in!\" they shouted in unison.\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\n\"Oh, Woodie. Come in. Sit down. Want a drink--you're not in training?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. Had one. And it would be a damn sight better if you birds\ndidn't keep the stuff around.\"\n\n\"It's Chuck's.\" Lefty grinned.\n\n\"All right. I came to see about that bird you brought to me--Danner.\"\n\n\"Was he any good?\"\n\nWoodman hesitated. \"Fellows, if I told you how good he was, you wouldn't\nbelieve me. He's so good--I'm scared of him.\"\n\n\"Whaddaya mean?\"\n\n\"Just that. He gave Nellie thirty feet in a lap on the track.\"\n\n\"Great God!\"\n\n\"He jumped twenty-eight and eleven feet--running and standing. He kicked\nhalf a dozen punts for eighty and ninety yards and he passed the same\ndistance.\"\n\nLefty sat down on the window seat. His voice was hoarse. \"That--can't be\ndone, Woodie.\"\n\n\"I know it. But he did it. But that isn't what makes me frightened. How\nmuch do you think he weighs?\"\n\n\"One fifty-five--or thereabouts.\"\n\nWoodie shook his head. \"No, Lefty, he weighs two hundred and eleven.\"\n\n\"Two eleven! He can't, Woodie. There's something wrong with your\nscales.\"\n\n\"Not a thing.\"\n\nThe two students stared at each other and then at the coach. They were\nable to grasp the facts intellectually, but they could not penetrate the\nreactions of their emotions. At last Lefty said: \"But that\nisn't--well--it isn't human, Woodie.\"\n\n\"That's why I'm scared. Something has happened to this bird. He has a\ndisease of some kind--that has toughened him. Like Pott's disease, that\nturns you to stone. But you wouldn't think it. There's not a trace of\nanything on the surface. I'm having a blood test made soon. Wait till\nto-morrow when you see him in action. It'll terrify you. Because you'll\nhave the same damned weird feeling I have--that he isn't doing one tenth\nof what he can do--that he's really just playing with us all. By God, if\nI was a bit superstitious, I'd throw up my job and get as much distance\nbetween me and that bird as I could. I'm telling you simply to prepare\nyou. There's something mighty funny about him, and the sooner we find\nout, the better.\"\n\nMr. Woodman left the dormitory. Lefty and Chuck stared at each other for\nthe space of a minute, and then, with one accord, they went together to\nthe registrar's office. There they found Hugo's address on the campus,\nand in a few minutes they were at his door.\n\n\"Come in,\" Hugo said. He smiled when he saw Lefty and Chuck. \"Want some\nmore trunks moved?\"\n\n\"Maybe--later.\" They sat down, eying Hugo speculatively. Lefty acted as\nspokesman. \"Listen here, guy, we've just seen Woodie and he says you're\nphenomenal--so much so that it isn't right.\"\n\nHugo reddened. He had feared that his exhibition was exaggerated by his\neagerness to impress the coach. He said nothing and Lefty continued:\n\"You're going to be here for four years and you're going to love this\nplace. You're going to be willing to die for it. All the rest of your\nlife the fact that you went to old Webster is going to make a\ndifference. But there's one thing that Webster insists on--and that's\nfair play. And honesty--and courage. You've come from a little town in\nthe West and you're a stranger here. Understand, this is all in a spirit\nof friendship. So far--we like you. We want you to be one of us. To\nbelong. You have a lot to learn and a long way to go. I'm being frank\nbecause I want to like you. For instance, Chuck here is a millionaire.\nMy old man is no dead stick in the Blue Book. Things like that will be\ndifferent from what you've known before. But the important thing is to\nbe a square shooter. Don't be angry. Do you understand?\"\n\nHugo walked to the window and looked out into the thickened gloom. He\nhad caught the worry, the repression, in Lefty's voice. The youth, his\nmerry blue eyes suddenly grave, his poised self abnormally disturbed,\nhad suggested a criticism of some sort. What was it? Hugo was hurt and a\nlittle frightened. Would his college life be a repetition of Indian\nCreek? Would the athletes and the others in college of his own age fear\nand detest him--because he was superior? Was that what they meant? He\ndid not know. He was loath to offend Lefty and Chuck. But there seemed\nno alternative to the risk. No one had talked to him in that way for a\nlong time. He sat on his bed. \"Fellows,\" he said tersely, \"I don't think\nI know what you're driving at. Will you tell me?\"\n\nThe roommates fidgeted. They did not know exactly, either. They had come\nto fathom the abnormality in Hugo. Chuck lit a cigarette. Lefty smiled\nwith an assumed ease. \"Why--nothing, Danner. You see--well--I'm\nquarterback of the football team. And you'll probably be on it this\nyear--we haven't adopted the new idea of keeping freshmen off the\nvarsity. Just wanted to tell you those--well--those principles.\"\n\nHugo knew he had not been answered. He felt, too, that he would never in\nhis life give away his secret. The defences surrounding it had been too\nimmutably fixed. His joy at knowing that he had been accepted so soon as\na logical candidate for the football team was tempered by this\nquestioning. \"I have principles, fellows.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Lefty rose. \"Guess we'll be going. By the way, Woodie said you\nsmashed a couple of track records to-day. Where'd you learn?\"\n\n\"Nowhere.\"\n\n\"How come, then?\"\n\n\"Just--natural.\"\n\nLefty summoned his will. \"Sure it isn't--well--unhealthy. Woodie says\nthere are a couple of diseases that make you--well--get tough--like\nstone.\"\n\nHugo realized the purpose of the visit. \"Then--be sure I haven't any\ndiseases. My father had an M.D.\" He smiled awkwardly. \"Ever since I was\na kid, I've been stronger than most people. And I probably have a little\nedge still. Just an accident, that's all. Is that what you were\nwondering about?\"\n\nLefty smiled with instant relief. \"Yes, it is. And I'm glad you take it\nthat way. Listen--why don't you come over to the Inn and take dinner\nwith Chuck and me? Let commons go for to-night. What say?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt eleven Hugo wound his alarm clock and set it for seven. He yawned\nand smiled. All during supper he had listened to the glories of Webster\nand the advantages of belonging to the Psi Delta fraternity, to\ndescriptions of parties and to episodes with girls. Lefty and Chuck had\nembraced him in their circle. They had made suggestions about what he\nshould wear and whom he should know; they had posted him on the\nbehaviour best suited for each of his professors. They liked him and he\nliked them, immensely. They were the finest fellows in the world.\nWebster was a magnificent university. And he was going to be one of its\nmost glorious sons.\n\nHe undressed and went to bed. In a moment he slept, drawing in deep,\nswift breaths. His face was smiling and his arm was extended, whether to\nward off shadows or to embrace a new treasure could not be told. In the\nbright sunshine of morning his alarm jangled and he woke to begin his\ncareer as an undergraduate.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nFrom the day of his arrival Webster University felt the presence of Hugo\nDanner. Classes, football practice, hazing, fraternity scouting began on\nthat morning with a feverish and good-natured hurly-burly that, for a\ntime, completely bewildered him. Hugo participated in everything. He\nwent to the classroom with pleasure. It was never difficult for him to\nlearn and never easier than in those first few weeks. The professors he\nhad known (and he reluctantly included his own father) were dry-as-dust\nindividuals who had none of the humanities. And at least some of the\nprofessors at Webster were brilliant, urbane, capable of all\nunderstanding. Their lectures were like tonic to Hugo.\n\nThe number of his friends grew with amazing rapidity. It seemed that he\ncould not cross the campus without being hailed by a member of the\nfootball team and presented to another student. The Psi Deltas saw to it\nthat he met the entire personnel of their chapter at Webster. Other\nfraternities looked at him with covetous eyes, but Lefty Foresman, who\nwas chairman of the membership committee, let it be known that the Psi\nDeltas had marked Hugo for their own. And no one refused their bid.\n\nOn the second Monday after college opened, Hugo went to the class\nelections and found to his astonishment that he received twenty-eight\nvotes for president. A boy from a large preparatory school was elected,\nbut twenty-eight votes spoke well for the reputation he had gained in\nthat short time. On that day, too, he learned the class customs.\nFreshmen had to wear black caps, black shoes and socks and ties. They\nwere not allowed to walk on the grass or to ride bicycles. The ancient\ncannon in the center of the class square was defended annually by the\nsophomores, and its theft was always attempted by the freshmen. No\nentering class had stolen it in eight years. Those things amused Hugo.\nThey gave him an intimate feeling of belonging to his school. He wrote\nto his parents about them.\n\nDean Aiken, the newly elected president of the freshman class,\napproached Hugo on the matter of the cannon. \"We want a gang of good\nhusky boys to pull it up some night and take it away. Are you with us?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nLeft to his own considerations, Hugo recalled his promise and walked\nacross the campus with the object of studying the cannon. It was a\nmedium-sized piece of Revolutionary War vintage. It stood directly in\nthe rear of Webster Hall, and while Hugo regarded it, he noticed that\ntwo sophomores remained in the vicinity. He knew that guard, changed\nevery two hours, would be on duty day and night until Christmas was\nsafely passed. Well, the cannon was secure. It couldn't be rolled away.\nThe theft of it would require first a free-for-all with the sophomores\nand after a definite victory a mob assault of the gun. Hugo walked\ncloser to it.\n\n\"Off the grass, freshman!\"\n\nHe wheeled obediently. One of the guards approached him. \"Get off the\ngrass and stay off and don't look at that cannon with longing. It isn't\nhealthy for young freshmen.\"\n\nHugo grinned. \"All right, fella. But you better keep a double guard on\nthat thing while I want it.\"\n\nTwo nights later, during a heavy rain that had begun after the fall of\ndark, Hugo clad himself in a slicker and moved vaguely into the night.\nPresently he reached the cannon yard, and in the shelter of an arch he\nsaw the sophomore guards. They smoked cigarettes, and one of them sang\nsoftly. Day and night a pair of conscripted sentries kept watchful eyes\non the gun. A shout from either of them would bring the whole class\ntumbling from its slumber in a very few moments. Hugo moved out of their\nvision. The campus was empty.\n\nHe rounded Webster Hall, the mud sucking softly under his feet and the\nrain dampening his face. From beneath his coat he took a flare and\nlighted the fuse. He heard the two sophomores running toward it in the\nthick murk. When they were very close, he stepped on to the stone\nflagging, looked up into the cloudy sky, gathered himself, and leaped\nover the three stories of Webster Hall. He landed with a loud thud ten\nfeet from the cannon. When the sophomores returned, after extinguishing\nthe flare, their cherished symbol of authority had vanished.\n\nThere was din on the campus. First the loud cries of two voices. Then\nthe screech of raised windows, the babble of more voices, and the rush\nof feet that came with new gusts of rain. Flash-lights pierced the\ngloom. Where the cannon had been, a hundred and then two hundred figures\ngathered, swirled, organized search-parties, built a fire. Dawn came,\nand the cannon was still missing. The clouds lifted. In the wan light\nsome one pointed up. There, on the roof of Webster Hall, with the\nnumerals of the freshman class painted on its muzzle, was the old\nweapon. Arms stretched. An angry, incredulous hum waxed to a steady\npitch and waned as the sophomores dispersed.\n\nIn the morning, theory ran rife. The freshmen were tight-lipped,\npretending knowledge where they had none, exulting secretly. Dean Aiken\nwas kidnapped at noon and given a third degree, which extorted no\ninformation. The theft of the cannon and its elevation to the roof of\nthe hall entered the annals of Webster legend. And Hugo, watching the\nlaborious task of its removal from the roof, seemed merely as pleased\nand as mystified as the other freshmen.\n\nSo the autumn commenced. The first football game was played and Hugo\nmade a touchdown. He made another in the second game. They took him to\nNew York in November for the dinner that was to celebrate the entrance\nof a new chapter to Psi Delta.\n\nHis fraternity had hired a private car. As soon as the college towers\nvanished, the entertainment committee took over the party. Glasses were\nfilled with whisky and passed by a Negro porter. Hugo took his with a\nfeeling of nervousness and of excited anticipation. The coach had given\nhim permission to break training--advised it, in fact. And Hugo had\nnever tasted liquor. He watched the others, holding his glass gingerly.\nThey swallowed their drinks, took more. The effect did not seem to be\ngreat. He smelled the whisky, and the smell revolted him.\n\n\"Drink up, Danner!\"\n\n\"Never use the stuff. I'm afraid it'll throw me.\"\n\n\"Not you. Come on! Bottoms up!\"\n\nIt ran into his throat, hot and steaming. He swallowed a thousand\nneedles and knew the warmth of it in his stomach. They gave another\nglass to him and then a third. Some of the brothers were playing cards.\nHugo watched them. He perceived that his feet were loose on their ankles\nand that his shoulders lurched. It would not do to lose control of\nhimself, he thought. For another man, it might be safe. Not for him. He\nrepeated the thought inanely. Some one took his arm.\n\n\"Nice work in the game last week. Pretty.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Woodie says you're the best man on the team. Glad you went Psi Delt.\nBest house on the campus. Great school, Webster. You'll love it.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Hugo said.\n\nThe railroad coach was twisting and writhing peculiarly. Hugo suddenly\nwanted to be in the air. He hastened to the platform of the car and\nstood on it, squinting his eyes at the countryside. When they reached\nthe Grand Central Terminal he was cured of his faintness. They rode to\nthe theatre in an omnibus and saw the matin\u00e9e of a musical show. Hugo\nhad never realized that so many pretty girls could be gathered together\nin one place. Their scant, glittering costumes flashed in his face. He\nwanted them. Between the acts the fraternity repaired in a body to the\nlavatory and drank whisky from bottles.\n\nHugo began to feel that he was living at last. He was among men,\nsophisticated men, and learning to be like them. Nothing like the\n_camaraderie_, the show, the liquor, in Indian Creek. He was wearing the\nsuit that Lefty Foresman had chosen for him. He felt well dressed, cool,\ncapable. He was intensely well disposed toward his companions. When the\nshow was over, he stood in the bright lights, momentarily depressed by\nthe disappearance of the long file of girls. Then he shouldered among\nhis companions and went out of the theatre riotously.\n\nTwo long tables were drawn up at the Raven, a restaurant famous for its\nroast meats, its beer, and its lack of scruples about the behaviour of\nits guests. The Psi Deltas took their places at the tables. The\ndining-room they occupied was private. Hugo saw as if in a dream the\nlong rows of silverware, the dishes of celery and olives, and the ranks\nof shining glasses. They sat. Waiters wound their way among them. There\nwas a song. The toastmaster, a New York executive who had graduated from\nWebster twenty years before, understood the temper of his charge. He was\nwitty, ribald, genial.\n\nHe made a speech, but not too long a speech. He called on the president\nof a bank, who rose totteringly and undid the toastmaster's good offices\nby making too long a speech. Its reiterated \"dear old Websters\" were\nfinally lost in the ring and tinkle of glassware and cutlery.\n\nAt the end of the long meal Hugo realized that his being had undergone\nchange. Objects approached and receded before his vision. The voice of\nthe man sitting beside him came to his ears as if through water. His\nmind continually turned upon itself in a sort of infatuated examination.\nHis attention could not be held even on his own words. He decided that\nhe was feverish. Then some one said: \"Well, Danner, how do you like\nbeing drunk?\"\n\n\"Drunk?\"\n\n\"Sure. You aren't going to tell me you're sober, are you?\"\n\nWhen the speaker had gone, Hugo realized that it was Chuck. There had\nbeen no feeling of recognition. \"I'm drunk!\" he said.\n\n\"Some one give Danner a drink. He has illusions.\"\n\n\"Drunk! Why, this man isn't drunk. It's monstrous. He has a weakened\nspine, that's all.\"\n\n\"I'm drunk,\" Hugo repeated. He knew then what it was to be drunk. The\ntoastmaster was rising again. Hugo saw it dimly.\n\n\"Fellows!\" A fork banged on a glass. \"Fellows!\" There was a slow\nincrease in silence. \"Fellows! It's eleven o'clock now. And I have a\nsurprise for you.\"\n\n\"Surprise! Hey, guys, shut up for the surprise!\"\n\n\"Fellows! What I was going to say is this: the girls from the show we\nsaw this afternoon are coming over here--all thirty of 'em. We're going\nup to my house for a real party. And the lid'll be off. Anything\ngoes--only anybody that fights gets thrown out straight off without an\nargument. Are you on?\"\n\nThe announcement was greeted by a stunned quiet which grew into a bellow\nof approval. Plates and glasses were thrown on the floor. Lefty leaped\non to the table and performed a dance. The proprietor came in, looked,\nand left hastily, and then the girls arrived.\n\nThey came through the door, after a moment of reluctant hesitation, like\na flood of brightly colored water. They sat down in the laps of the\nboys, on chairs, on the edge of the disarrayed tables. They were served\nwith innumerable drinks as rapidly as the liquor could be brought. They\nwere working, that night, for the ten dollars promised to each one. But\nthey were working with college boys, which was a rest from the stream of\naffluent and paunchy males who made their usual escort. Their gaiety was\nbetter than assumed.\n\nHugo had never seen such a party or dreamed of one. His vision was\ncleared instantly of its cobwebs. He saw three boys seize one girl and\nturn her heels over head. A piano was moved in. She jumped up and\nstarted dancing on the table. Then there was a voice at his side.\n\n\"Hello, good-looking. I could use that drink if you can spare it.\"\n\nHugo looked at the girl. She had brown hair that had been curled. Her\nlips and cheeks were heavily rouged and the corners of her mouth turned\ndown in a sort of petulance or fatigue. But she was pretty. And her\nbody, showing whitely above her evening dress, was creamy and warm. He\ngave the drink to her. She sat in his lap.\n\n\"Gosh,\" he whispered. She laughed.\n\n\"I saw her first,\" some one said, pulling at the girl's arm.\n\n\"Go 'way,\" Hugo shouted. He pushed the other from them. \"What's your\nname?\"\n\n\"Bessie. What's yours?\"\n\n\"Hugo.\"\n\nThe girl accepted two glasses from a waiter. They drained them, looking\nat each other over the rims. \"Got any money, Hugo?\"\n\nHugo had. He carried on his person the total of his cash assets. Some\nfifty dollars. \"Sure. I have fifty dollars,\" he answered.\n\nHe felt her red lips against his ear. \"Let's you and me duck this party\nand have a little one of our own. I've got an apartment not far from\nhere.\"\n\nHe could hear the pounding of his heart. \"Let's.\"\n\nThey moved unostentatiously from the room. Outside, in the hall, she\ntook his hand. They ran to the front door.\n\nThere was the echo of bedlam in his whirling mind when they walked\nthrough the almost deserted street. She called to a taxi and they were\ndriven for several blocks. At a cheap dance hall they took a table and\ndrank more liquor. When his head was turned, she narrowed her eyes and\ncalculated the effect of the alcohol against the dwindling of his purse.\nThey danced.\n\n\"Gee, you're a swell dancer.\"\n\n\"So are you, Bessie.\"\n\n\"Still wanna go home with Bessie?\"\n\n\"Mmmm.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nAnother taxi ride. The lights seethed past him. A dark house and three\nflights of rickety stairs. The gritty sound of a key in a lock. A little\nroom with a table, a bed, two chairs, a gas-light turned low, a\ndisheveled profusion of female garments.\n\n\"Here we are. Sit down.\"\n\nHugo looked at her tensely. He laughed then, with a harsh sound. She\nflew into his arms, returning his searching caresses with startling\nfrankness. Presently they moved across the room. He could hear the\nnoises on the street at long, hot intervals.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHugo opened his eyes and the light smote them with pain. He raised his\nhead wonderingly. His stomach crawled with a foul nausea. He saw the\ndirty room. Bessie was not in it. He staggered to the wash-bowl and was\nsick. He noticed then that her clothes were missing. The fact impressed\nhim as one that should have significance. He rubbed his head and eyes.\nThen he thought accurately. He crossed the room and felt in his trousers\npockets. The money was gone.\n\nAt first it did not seem like a catastrophe. He could telegraph to his\nfather for more money. Then he realized that he was in New York, without\na ticket back to the campus, separated from his friends, and not knowing\nthe address of the toastmaster. He could not find his fraternity\nbrothers and he could not get back to school without more money.\nMoreover, he was sick.\n\nHe dressed with miserable slowness and went down to the street. Served\nhim right. He had been a fool. He shrugged. A sharp wind blew out of a\nbright sky.\n\nMaybe, he thought, he should walk back to Webster. It was only eighty\nmiles and that distance could be negotiated in less than two hours by\nhim. But that was unwise. People would see his progress. He sat down in\nMadison Square Park and looked at the Flatiron Building with a leisurely\neye. A fire engine surged up the street. A man came to collect the trash\nin a green can. A tramp lay down and was ousted by a policeman.\n\nBy and by he realized that he was hungry. A little man with darting eyes\ntook a seat beside him. He regarded Hugo at short intervals. At length\nhe said. \"You got a dime for a cup of coffee?\" His words were blurred by\naccent.\n\n\"No. I came here from school last night and my money was stolen.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" there was a tinge of discouragement in the other's voice. \"And\nhungry, perhaps?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"Me--I am also hungry. I have not eaten since two days.\"\n\nThat impressed Hugo as a shameful and intolerable circumstance. \"Let's\ngo over there\"--he indicated a small restaurant--\"and eat. Then I'll\npromise to send the money by mail. At least, we'll be fed that way.\"\n\n\"We will be thrown to the street on our faces.\"\n\n\"Not I. Nobody throws me on my face. And I'll look out for you.\"\n\nThey crossed the thoroughfare and entered the restaurant. The little man\nordered a quantity of food, and Hugo, looking guiltily at the waiter,\nduplicated the order. They became distantly acquainted during the\nfilched repast. The little man's name was Izzie. He sold second-hand\nrugs. But he was out of work. Eventually they finished. The waiter\nbrought the check. He was a large man, whose jowls and hips and\nshoulders were heavily weighted with muscle.\n\nHugo stood up. \"Listen, fellow,\" he began placidly, \"my friend and I\nhaven't a cent between us. I'm Hugo Danner, from Webster University, and\nI'll mail you the price of this feed to-morrow. I'll write down my name\nand--\"\n\nHe got no further. The waiter spoke in a thick voice. \"So! One of them\nguys, eh? Tryin' to get away with it when I'm here, huh? Well, I tell\nyou how you're gonna pay. You're gonna pay this check with a bloody\nmush, see?\" His fist doubled and drew back. Hugo did not shift his\nposition. The fist came forward, but an arm like stone blocked it.\nHugo's free hand barely flicked to the waiter's jaw. He rolled under the\ntable. \"Come on,\" he said, but Izzie had already vanished through the\ndoor.\n\nHugo walked hurriedly up the street and turned a corner. A hand tugged\nat his coat. He turned and was confronted by Izzie. \"I seen you through\nthe window. Jeest, guy, you kin box. Say, I know where you kin clean\nup--if you got the nerve.\"\n\n\"Clean up? Where?\"\n\n\"Come on. We better get out of here anyhow.\"\n\nThey made their way toward the river. The city changed character on the\nother side of the elevated railroad, and presently they were walking\nthrough a dirty, evil-smelling, congested neighborhood.\n\n\"Where are we going, Izzie?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Mr. Danner.\"\n\n\"What's the idea?\"\n\n\"You wait.\"\n\nAnother series of dirty blocks. Then they came to a bulky building that\nspread a canopy over the sidewalk. \"Here,\" Izzie said, and pointed.\n\nHis finger indicated a sign, which Hugo read twice. It said: \"Battling\nOle Swenson will meet all comers in this gymnasium at three this\nafternoon and eight to-night. Fifty dollars will be given to any man,\nblack or white, who can stay three rounds with him, and one hundred\ndollars cash money to the man who knocks out Battling Ole Swenson, the\nTerror of the Docks.\"\n\n\"See,\" Izzie said, rubbing his hands excitedly, \"mebbe you could do it.\"\n\nA light dawned on Hugo. He smiled. \"I can,\" he replied. \"What time is\nit?\"\n\n\"Two o'clock.\"\n\n\"Well, let's go.\"\n\nThey entered the lobby of the \"gymnasium.\" \"Mr. Epstein,\" Izzie called,\n\"I gotta fighter for the Swede.\"\n\nMr. Epstein was a pale fat man who ignored the handicap of the dank\ncigar in his mouth and roared when he spoke. He glanced at Hugo and then\naddressed Izzie. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"There.\"\n\nEpstein looked at Hugo and then was shaken by laughter. \"There, you\nsays, and there I looks and what do I see but a pink young angel face\nthat Ole would swallow without chewing.\"\n\nHugo said: \"I don't think so. I'm willing to try.\"\n\nEpstein scowled. \"Run away from here, kid, before you get hurt. Ole\nwould laugh at you. This isn't easy money. It takes a man to get a look\nat it.\"\n\nIzzie stamped impatiently. \"I tell you, Mr. Epstein, I seen this boy\nfight. He's the goods. He can beat your Ole. I bet he can.\" His voice\ncaught and he glanced nervously at Hugo. \"I bet ten dollars he can.\"\n\n\"How much?\" Epstein bellowed.\n\n\"Well--say twenty dollars.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Fifty dollars. It's all I got, Epstein.\"\n\n\"All right--go in and sign up and leave your wad. Kid,\" he turned to\nHugo, \"you may think you're husky, but Ole is a killer. He's six nine in\nhis socks and he weighs two hundred and eighty. He'll mash you.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Hugo repeated.\n\n\"Well, you'll be meat. We'll put you second on the list. And the\nlights'll go out fast enough for yuh.\"\n\nHugo followed Izzie and reached him in time to see a fifty-dollar bill\npeeled from a roll which was extracted with great intricacy from Izzie's\nclothes. \"I thought you hadn't eaten for two days!\"\n\n\"It's God's truth,\" Izzie answered uneasily. \"I was savin' this\ndough--an' it's lucky, too, isn't it?\"\n\nHugo did not know whether to laugh or to be angry. He said: \"And you'd\nhave let me take a poke in the jaw from that waiter. You're a hell of a\nguy, Izzie.\"\n\nIzzie moved his eyes rapidly. \"I ain't so bad. I'm bettin' on you, ain't\nI? An' I got you a chancet at the Swede, didn't I?\"\n\n\"How'd you know that waiter couldn't kill me?\"\n\n\"Well--he didn't. Anyhow, what's a poke in the jaw to a square meal,\neh?\"\n\n\"When the other fellow gets the poke and you get the meal. All right,\nIzzie. I wish I thought Ole was going to lick me.\"\n\nHugo wrote his name under a printed statement to the effect that the\nfight managers were not responsible for the results of the combat. The\nman who led him to a dressing-room was filled with sympathy and advice.\nHe told Hugo that one glance at Ole would discourage his reckless\navarice. But Hugo paid no attention. The room was dirty. It smelled of\nsweat and rubber sneakers. He sat there for half an hour, reading a\nnewspaper. Outside, somewhere, he could hear the mumble of a gathering\ncrowd, punctuated by the voices of candy and peanut-hawkers.\n\nAt last they brought some clothes to him. A pair of trunks that flapped\nover his loins, ill-fitting canvas shoes, a musty bath robe. When the\ndoor of his room opened, the noise of the crowd was louder. Finally it\nwas hushed. He heard the announcer. It was like the voice of a minister\ncoming through the stained windows of a church. It rose and fell. Then\nthe distant note of the gong. After that the crowd called steadily,\nsometimes in loud rage and sometimes almost in a whisper.\n\nFinally they brought Ole's first victim into Hugo's cell. He was a man\nwith the physique of a bull. His face was cut and his eyes were\ndarkening. One of the men heaving his stretcher looked at Hugo.\n\n\"Better beat it, kid, while you can still do it on your own feet. You\nain't even got the reach for Ole. He's a grizzly, bo. He'll just about\nkill you.\"\n\nHugo tightened his belt and swung the electric light back and forth with\na slow-moving fist. Another man expertly strapped his fists with\nadhesive tape.\n\n\"When do I go out?\" Hugo asked.\n\n\"You mean, when do you get knocked out?\" the second laughed.\n\n\"Fight?\"\n\n\"Well, if you're determined to get croaked, you do it now.\"\n\nIn the arena it was dazzling. A bank of noisy people rose on all sides\nof him. Hugo walked down the aisle and clambered into the ring. Ole was\none of the largest men he had ever seen in his life. There was no doubt\nof his six feet nine inches and his two hundred and eighty pounds. Hugo\nimagined that the man was not a scientific fighter. A bruiser. Well, he\nknew nothing of fighting, either.\n\nA man in his shirt sleeves stood up in the ring and bellowed, \"The next\ncontestant for the reward of fifty dollars to stay three rounds with\nbattling Ole and one hundred dollars to knock him out is Mr. H. Smith.\"\nThey cheered. It was a nasty sound, filled with the lust for blood. Hugo\nrealized that he was excited. His knees wabbled when he rose and his\nhand trembled as he took the monstrous paw of the Swede and saw his\nunpleasant smile. Hugo's heart was pounding. For one instant he felt\nweak and human before Battling Ole. He whispered to himself: \"Quit it,\nyou fool; you know better; you can't even be hurt.\" It did not make him\nany more quiet.\n\nThen they were sitting face to face. A bell rang. The hall became silent\nas the mountainous Swede lumbered from his corner. He towered over Hugo,\nwho stood up and went out to meet him like David approaching Goliath. To\nthe crowd the spectacle was laughable. There was jeering before they\nmet. \"Where's your mamma?\" \"Got your bottle, baby?\" \"Put the poor little\nbastard back in his carriage.\" \"What's this--a fight or a freak show?\"\nLaughter.\n\nIt was like cold water to Hugo. His face set. He looked at Ole. The\nSwede's fist moved back like the piston of a great engine into which\nsteam has been let slowly. Then it came forward. Hugo, trained to see\nand act in keeping with his gigantic strength, dodged easily. \"Atta\nboy!\" \"One for Johnny-dear!\" The fist went back and came again and\nagain, as if that piston, gathering speed, had broken loose and was\nflailing through the screaming air. Hugo dodged like a beam of light,\nand the murderous weapon never touched him. The spectators began to\napplaud his speed. He could beat the Swede's fist every time. \"Run him,\nkiddo!\" \"It's only three rounds.\"\n\nThe bell. Ole was panting. As he sat in his corner, his coal-scuttle\ngloves dangling, he cursed in his native tongue. Too little to hit.\nBell. The second round was the same. Hugo never attempted to touch the\nSwede. Only to avoid him. And the man worked like a Trojan. Sweat\nseethed over his big, blank face. His small eyes sharpened to points. He\nbrought his whole carcass flinging through the air after his fist. But\nevery blow ended in a sickening wrench that missed the target. The crowd\ngrew more excited. During the interval between the second and third\nrounds there was betting on the outcome. Three to one that Ole would\nconnect and murder the boy. Four to one. One to five that Hugo would win\nfifty dollars before he died beneath the trip-hammer.\n\nThe third round opened. The crowd suddenly tired of the sport. A shrill\nfemale voice reached Hugo's cold, concentrated mind: \"Keep on running,\nyellow baby!\"\n\nSo. They wanted a killing. They called him yellow. The Swede was on him,\nelephantine, sweating, sucking great, rumbling breaths of air, swinging\nhis fists. Hugo studied the motion. That fist to that side, up, down,\nnow!\n\nLike hail they began to land upon the Swede. Bewilderingly, everywhere.\nNo hope of guarding. Every blow smashed, stung, ached. No chance to\nswing back. Cover up. His arms went over his face. He felt rivets drive\ninto his kidneys. He reached out and clinched. They rocked in each\nother's arms. Dazed by that bitter onslaught of lightning blows, Ole\nthought only to lock Hugo in his arms and crush him. When they clinched,\nthe crowd, grown instantly hysterical, sank back in despair. It was\nover. Ole could break the little man's back. They saw his arms spring\ninto knots. Jesus! Hugo's fist shot between their chests and Ole was\nthrown violently backward. Impossible. He lunged back, crimson to kill,\none hand guarding his jaw. \"Easy, now, for the love of God, easy,\" Hugo\nsaid to himself. There. On the hand at the chin. Hugo's gloves went out.\nLift him! It connected. The Swede left the floor and crumpled slowly,\nwith a series of bumping sounds. And how the hyenas yelled!\n\nThey crowded into his dressing-room afterwards. Epstein came to his side\nbefore he had dressed. \"Come out and have a mug of suds, kid. That was\nthe sweetest fight I ever hope to live to see. I can sign you up for a\nfortune right now. I can make you champ in two years.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Hugo said.\n\nThe man persisted. He talked earnestly. He handed Hugo a hundred-dollar\nbill. Hugo finished his dressing. Izzie wormed his way in. \"Fifty\ndollars I won yet! Didn't I tole you, Mr. Epstein!\"\n\n\"Come here, Izzie!\"\n\nThe little man ran to shake Hugo's hand, but it was extended for another\nreason. \"I want that fifty you won,\" he said unsmilingly. \"When a bird\ntracks along for a free feed and lets another guy fight for him and has\na roll big enough to stop up a rainspout, he owes money. That lunch will\nset you back just exactly what you won on me.\"\n\nThere was laughter in the room. Izzie whimpered. \"Ain't you got a\nhundred all ready that I got for you? Ain't it enough that you got it?\nAin't I got a wife wit' kids yet?\"\n\n\"No, it ain't, yet.\" Hugo snapped the fingers of his extended hand. The\nother hand doubled significantly. Izzie gave him the money. He was\nalmost in tears. The others guffawed.\n\n\"Wait up, bo. Give us your address if you ever change your mind. You can\npick up a nice livin' in this game.\"\n\n\"No, thanks. All I needed was railroad fare. Thank you,\ngentlemen--and--good-by.\"\n\nNo one undertook to hinder Hugo's departure.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGreatness seemed to elude Hugo, success such as he had earned was\ninadequate, and his friendships as well as his popularity were tinged\nwith a sort of question that he never understood. By the end of winter\nhe was well established in Webster as a great athlete. Psi Delta sang\nhis praises and was envied his deeds. Lefty and Chuck treated him as a\nbrother. And, Hugo perceived, none of that treatment and none of that\nsociety was quite real. He wondered if his personality was so meagre\nthat it was not equal to his strength. He wondered if his strength was\nreally the asset he had dreamed it would be, and if, perhaps, other\npeople were not different from him in every way, so that any close human\ncontact was impossible to him.\n\nIt was a rather tragic question to absorb a man so filled with life and\nambition as he. Yet every month had raised it more insistently. He saw\nother men sharing their inmost souls and he could never do that. He saw\nthose around him breaking their hearts and their lungs for the\nuniversity, and, although it was never necessary for him to do that, he\ndoubted that he could if he would. Webster was only a school. A\nsentiment rather than an ideal, a place rather than a goal of dreams. He\nthought that he was cynical. He thought that he was inhuman. It worried\nhim.\n\nHis love was a similar experience. He fell in love twice during that\nfirst year in college. Once at a prom with a girl who was related to\nLefty--a rich, socially secure girl who had studied abroad and who\nalmost patronized her cousin.\n\nHugo had seen her dancing, and her long, slender legs and arms had\nissued an almost tangible challenge to him. She had looked over Lefty's\nshoulder and smiled vaguely. They had met. Hugo danced with her. \"I love\nto come to a prom,\" she said; \"it makes me feel young again.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\nShe ignored the obvious temptation to be coy and he appreciated that.\n\"Twenty-one.\"\n\nIt seemed reasonably old to Hugo. The three years' difference in their\nages had given her a pinnacle of maturity.\n\n\"And that makes you old,\" he reflected.\n\nShe nodded. Her name was Iris. Afterwards Hugo thought that it should\nhave been Isis. Half goddess, half animal. He had never met with the\nvanguard of emancipated American womanhood before then. \"You're the\ngreat Hugo Danner, aren't you? I've seen your picture in the sporting\nsections.\" She read sporting sections. He had never thought of a woman\nin that light. \"But you're really much handsomer. You have more sex and\nmasculinity and you seem more intelligent.\"\n\nThen, between the dances, Lefty had come. \"She? Oh, she's a sort of\ncousin. Flies in all the high altitudes in town. Blue Book and all that.\nBetter look out, Hugo. She plays rough.\"\n\n\"She doesn't look rough.\"\n\nBoth youths watched her. Long, dark hair, willowy body, high, pale\nforehead, thin nose, red mouth, smiling like a lewd agnostic and dancing\nclose to her partner, enjoying even that. \"Well, look out, Hugo. If she\nwants to play, don't let her play with your heart. Anything else is\nquite in the books.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nShe came to the stag line, ignoring a sequence of invitations, and asked\nhim to dance. They went out on the velvet campus. \"I could love you--for\na little while,\" she said. \"It's too bad you have to play football\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Is that an excuse?\"\n\nShe smiled remotely. \"You're being disloyal.\" Her fan moved delicately.\n\"But I shan't chide you. In fact, I'll stay over for the game--and I'll\nenjoy the anticipation--more, perhaps. But you'll have to win it--to win\nme. I'm not a soothing type.\"\n\n\"It will be easy--to win,\" Hugo said and she peered through the darkness\nwith admiration, because he had made his ellipsis of the object very\nplain.\n\n\"It is always easy for you to win, isn't it?\" she countered with an easy\nmockery, and Hugo shivered.\n\nThe game was won. Hugo had made his touchdown. He unfolded a note she\nhad written on the back of a score card. \"At my hotel at ten, then.\"\n\n\"Then.\" Someone lifted his eyes to praise him. His senses swam in\ncareful anticipation. They were cheering outside the dressing-room. A\ndifferent sound from the cheers at the fight-arena. Young, hilarious,\nhappy.\n\nAt ten he bent over the desk and was told to go to her room. The clerk\nshrugged. She opened the door. One light was burning. There was perfume\nin the air. She wore only a translucent kimono of pale-coloured silk.\nShe taught him a great many things that night. And Iris learned\nsomething, too, so that she never came back to Hugo, and kept the\nlonging for him as a sort of memory which she made hallowed in a shorn\nsoul. It was, for her, a single asceticism in a rather selfish life.\n\nHugo loved her for two weeks after that, and then his emotions wearied\nand he was able to see what she had done and why she did not answer his\nletters. His subdued fierceness was a vehement fire to women. His\nfiercer appetite was the cause of his early growth in a knowledge of\nthem. When most of his companions were finding their way into the\nmysteries of sex both unhandily and with much turmoil, he learned well\nand abnormally. It became a part of his secret self. Another barrier to\nthe level of the society that surrounded him. When he changed the name\nof Iris to Isis in his thoughts, he moved away from the Psi Deltas, who\nwould have been incapable of the notion. In person he stayed among them,\nbut in spirit he felt another difference, which he struggled to\nreconcile.\n\nIn March the thaws came, and under the warming sun Hugo made a\ndeliberate attempt to fall in love with Janice, who was the daughter of\nhis French professor. She was a happy, innocent little girl, with gold\nhair, and brown eyes that lived oddly beneath it. She worshipped Hugo.\nHe petted her, talked through long evenings to her, tried to be faithful\nto her in his most unfettered dreams, and once considered proposing to\nher. When he found himself unable to do that, he was compelled to resist\nan impulse to seduce her. Ashamed, believing himself unfit for a nice\ngirl, he untangled that romance as painlessly as he could, separating\nhimself from Janice little by little and denying every accusation of\nwaning interest.\n\nThen for a month he believed that he could never be satisfied by any\nwoman, that he was superior to women. He read the lives of great lovers\nand adulterers and he wished that he could see Bessie, who had taken his\nmoney long before in New York City. She appealed to him then more than\nall the others--probably, he thought, because he was drunk and had not\nviewed her in sharp perspective. For hours he meditated on women, while\nhe longed constantly to possess a woman.\n\nBut the habitual routine of his life did not suffer. He attended his\nclasses and lectures, played on the basketball team, tried tentatively\nto write for the campus newspaper, learned to perform indifferently on\nthe mandolin, and made himself into the semblance of an ideal college\nman. His criticism of college then was at its lowest ebb. He spent\nChristmas in New York at Lefty Foresman's parents' elaborate home,\nslightly intoxicated through the two weeks, hastening to the opera, to\nballs and parties, ill at ease when presented to people whose names\nstruck his ears familiarly, seeing for the first time the exaggeration\nof scale on which the very rich live and wondering constantly why he\nnever met Iris, wishing for and fearing that meeting while he wondered.\n\nWhen his first year at college was near to its end, and that still and\nrespectful silence that marks the passing of a senior class had fallen\nover the campus, Hugo realized with a shock that he would soon be on his\nway back to Indian Creek. Then, suddenly, he saw what an amazing and\nsplendid thing that year at college had been. He realized how it had\nfilled his life to the brim with activities of which he had not dreamed,\nhow it had shaped him so that he would be almost a stranger in his own\nhome, how it had aged and educated him in the business of living. When\nthe time of parting with his new friends drew near, he understood that\nthey were valuable to him, in spite of his questioning. And they made it\nclear that he would be missed by them. At last he shared a feeling with\nhis classmates, a fond sadness, an illimitable poignancy that was young\nand unadulterated by motive. He was perversely happy when he became\naware of it. He felt somewhat justified for being himself and living his\nlife.\n\nA day or two before college closed, he received a letter from his\nfather. It was the third he had received during the year. It said:\n\n     Dear Son--\n\n     Your mother and I have decided to break the news to you before you\n     leave for home, because there may be better opportunities for you\n     in the East than here at Indian Creek. When you went away to\n     Webster University, I agreed to take care of all your expenses. It\n     was the least I could do, I felt, for my only son. The two thousand\n     dollars your mother and I had saved seemed ample for your four\n     years. But the bills we have received, as well as your own demands,\n     have been staggering. In March, when a scant six hundred dollars of\n     the original fund remained, I invested the money in a mine stock\n     which, the salesman said, would easily net the six thousand dollars\n     you appeared to need. I now find to my chagrin that the stock is\n     worthless. I am unable to get back my purchase money.\n\n     It will be impossible during the coming year for me to let you have\n     more than five hundred dollars. Perhaps, with what you earn this\n     summer and with the exercise of economy, you can get along. I trust\n     so. But, anxious as we are to see you again, we felt that, in the\n     light of such information, you might prefer to remain in the East\n     to earn what you can.\n\n     We are both despondent over the situation and we wish that we could\n     do more than tender our regrets. But we hope that you will be able\n     to find some solution to this situation. Thus, with our very\n     warmest affection and our fondest hope, we wish you good fortune.\n\n     Your loving father,\n\n     ABEDNEGO DANNER.\n\nHugo read the letter down to the last period after the rather tremulous\nsignature. His emotions were confused. Touched by the earnest and\npathetically futile efforts of his father and by the attempt of that\nlonely little man to express what was, perhaps, a great affection, Hugo\nwas nevertheless aghast at a prospect that he had not considered. He was\ngoing to be thrown into the world on his own resources. And, resting his\nframe in his worn chair--a frame capable of smashing into banks and\ntaking the needed money without fear of punishment--Hugo began to wonder\ndismally if he was able even to support himself. No trade, no\noccupation, suggested itself. He had already experienced some of the\nmerciless coldness of the world. The boys would all leave soon. And then\nhe would be alone, unprovided for, helpless.\n\nHugo was frightened. He read the letter again, his wistful thoughts of\nhis parents diminishing before the reality of his predicament. He\ncounted his money. Eighty dollars in the bank and twelve in his pockets.\nHe was glad he had started an account after his experience with Bessie.\nHe was glad that he had husbanded more than enough to pay his fare to\nIndian Creek. Ninety-two dollars. He could live on that for a long time.\nPerhaps for the summer. And he would be able to get some sort of job. He\nwas strong, anyway. That comforted him. He looked out of his window and\ntried to enumerate the things that he could do. All sorts of farm work.\nHe could drive a team in the city. He could work on the docks. He\nconsidered nothing but manual labor. It would offer more. Gradually his\nfear that he would starve if left to his own devices ebbed from him, and\nit was replaced by grief that he could not return to Webster. Fourteen\nhundred dollars--that was the cost of his freshman year. He made a list\nof the things he could do without, of the work he could do to help\nhimself through college. Perhaps he could return. The fear slowly\ndiminished. He would be a working student in the year to come. He hated\nthe idea. His fraternity had taken no members from that class of humble\nyoung men who rose at dawn and scrubbed floors and waited on tables to\nwin the priceless gem of education. Lefty and Chuck would be chilly\ntoward such a step. They would even offer him money to avoid it. It was\na sad circumstance, at best.\n\nWhen that period of tribulation passed, Hugo became a man. But he\nsuffered keenly from his unwonted fears for some time. The calm and\nsuave youth who had made love to Iris was buried beneath his frightened\nand imaginative adolescence. It wore out the last of his childishness.\nImmediately afterwards he learned about money and how it is earned. He\nsat there in the dormitory, almost trembling with uncertainty and used\nmighty efforts to do the things he felt he must do. He wrote a letter to\nhis father which began: \"Dear Dad--Why in Sam Hill didn't you tell me\nyou were being reamed so badly by your nit-witted son and I'd have\nshovelled out and dug up some money for myself long ago?\" On rereading\nthat letter he realized that its tone was false. He wrote another in\nwhich he apologized with simple sincerity for the condition he had\nunknowingly created, and in which he expressed every confidence that he\ncould take care of himself in the future.\n\nHe bore that braver front through the last days of school. He shook\nLefty's hand warmly and looked fairly into his eyes. \"Well, so long, old\nsock. Be good.\"\n\n\"Be good, Hugo. And don't weaken. We'll need all your beef next year.\nDecided what you're going to do yet?\"\n\n\"No. Have you?\"\n\nLefty shrugged. \"I suppose I've got to go abroad with the family as\nusual. They wrote a dirty letter about the allowance I'd not have next\nyear if I didn't. Why don't you come with us? Iris'll be there.\"\n\nHugo grinned. \"No, sir! Iris once is very nice, but no man's equal to\nIris twice.\" His grin became a chuckle. \"And that's a poem which you can\nsay to Iris if you see her--and tell her I hope it makes her mad.\"\n\nLefty's blue eyes sparkled with appreciation. Danner was a wonderful\nboy. Full of wit and not dumb like most of his kind. Getting smooth,\ntoo. Be a great man. Too bad to leave him--even for the summer.\n\"Well--so long, old man.\"\n\nHugo watched Lefty lift his bags into a cab and roll away in the warm\nJune dust. Then Chuck:\n\n\"Well--by-by, Hugo. See you next September.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Take care of yourself.\"\n\n\"No chance of your going abroad, is there? Because we sure could paint\nthe old Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra red if you did.\"\n\n\"Not this year, Chuck.\"\n\n\"Well--don't take any wooden money.\"\n\n\"Don't do anything you wouldn't eat.\"\n\nHugo felt a lump in his throat. He could not say any more farewells. The\ncampus was almost deserted. No meals would be served after the next day.\nHe stared at the vacant dormitories and listened to the waning sound of\ndepartures. A train puffed and fumed at the station. It was filled with\nboys. Going away. He went to his room and packed. He'd leave, too. When\nhis suit-cases were filled, he looked round the room with damp eyes. He\nthought that he was going to cry, mastered himself, and then did cry.\nSome time later he remembered Iris and stopped crying. He walked to the\nstation, recalling his first journey in the other direction, his\npinch-backed green suit, the trunk he had carried. Grand old place,\nWebster. Suddenly gone dead all over. There would be a train for New\nYork in half an hour. He took it. Some of the students talked to him on\nthe trip to the city. Then they left him, alone, in the great vacuum of\nthe terminal. The glittering corridors were filled with people. He\nwondered if he could find Bessie's house.\n\nAt a restaurant he ate supper. When he emerged, it was dark. He asked\nhis way, found a hotel, registered in a one-dollar room, went out on the\nstreet again. He walked to the Raven. Then he took a cab. He remembered\nBessie's house. An old woman answered the door. \"Bessie? Bessie? No girl\nby that name I remember.\"\n\nHugo described her. \"Oh, that tart! She ran out on me--owin' a week's\nrent.\"\n\n\"When was that?\"\n\n\"Some time last fall.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Hugo meditated. The woman spoke again. \"I did hear from one of my\nother girls that she'd gone to work at Coney, but I ain't had time to\nlook her up. Owes me four dollars, she does. But Bessie, as you calls\nher--her name's Sue--wasn't never much good. Still--\" the woman\nscrutinized Hugo and giggled--\"Bessie ain't the only girl in the world.\nI got a cute little piece up here named Palmerlee says only the other\nnight she's lonely. Glad to interdooce you.\"\n\nHugo thought of his small capital. \"No, thanks.\"\n\nHe walked away. A warm moon was dimly sensible above the lights of the\nstreet. He decided to go to Coney Island and look for the lost Bessie.\nIt would cost him only a dime, and she owed him money. He smiled a\nlittle savagely and thought that he would collect its equivalent. Then\nhe boarded the subway, cursing himself for a fool and cursing his\nappetite for the fool's master. Why did he chase that particular little\nharlot on an evening when his mind should be bent toward more serious\npurposes? Certainly not because he had any intention of getting back his\nmoney. Because he wished to surprise her? Because he was angry that she\nhad cheated him? Or because she was the only woman in New York whom he\nknew? He decided it was the last reason. Finally the train reached Coney\nIsland, and Hugo descended into the fantastic hurly-burly on the street\nbelow. He realized the ridiculousness of his quest as he saw the miles\nof thronging people in the loud streets.\n\n\"See the fat woman, see Esmerelda, the beautiful fat woman, she weighs\nsix hundred pounds, she's had a dozen lovers, she's the fattest woman in\nthe world, a sensation, dressed in the robes of Cleopatra, robes that\ntook a bolt of cloth; but she's so fat they conceal nothing, ladies and\ngentlemen, see the beautiful fat woman....\" A roller coaster circled\nthrough the skies with a noise that was audible above the crowd's\nstaccato voice and dashed itself at the earth below. A merry-go-round\nwhirled goldenly and a band struck up a strident march. Hugo smelled\nstale beer and frying food. He heard the clang of a bell as a weight was\ndriven up to it by the shoulders of a young gentleman in a pink shirt.\n\n\"The strongest man in the world, ladies and gentlemen, come in and see\nThorndyke, the great professor of physical culture from Munich, Germany.\nHe can bend a spike in his bare hands, an elephant can pass over his\nbody without harming him, he can lift a weight of one ton....\" Hugo\nlaughed. Two girls saw him and brushed close. \"Buy us a drink, sport.\"\n\nThe strongest man in the world. Hugo wondered what sort of strong man he\nwould make. Perhaps he could go into competition with Dr. Thorndyke. He\nsaw himself pictured in gaudy reds and yellows, holding up an enormous\nweight. He remembered that he was looking for Bessie. Then he saw\nanother girl. She was sitting at a table, alone. That fact was\nsignificant. He sat beside her.\n\n\"Hello, tough,\" she said.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Wanna buy me a beer?\"\n\nHugo bought a beer and looked at the girl. Her hair was black and\nstraight. Her mouth was straight. It was painted scarlet. Her eyes were\nhard and dark. But her body, as if to atone for her face, was made in a\nseries of soft curves that fitted exquisitely into her black silk dress.\nHe tortured himself looking at her. She permitted it sullenly. \"You can\nbuy me a sandwich, if you want. I ain't eaten to-day.\"\n\nHe bought a sandwich, wondering if she was telling the truth. She ate\nravenously. He bought another and then a second glass of beer. After\nthat she rose. \"You can come with me if you wanna.\"\n\nOdd. No conversation, no vivacity, only a dull submission that was not\nin keeping with her appearance.\n\n\"Have you had enough to eat?\" he asked.\n\n\"It'll do,\" she responded.\n\nThey turned into a side street and moved away from the shimmering lights\nand the morass of people. Presently they entered a dingy frame house and\nwent upstairs. There was no one in the hall, no furniture, only a\nflickering gas-light. She unlocked a door. \"Come in.\"\n\nHe looked at her again. She took off her hat and arranged her dark hair\nso that it looped almost over one eye. Hugo wondered at her silence. \"I\ndidn't mean to rush,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I did. Gotta make some more. It'll be\"--she hesitated--\"two\nbucks.\"\n\nThe girl sat down and wept. \"Aw, hell,\" she said finally, looking at him\nwith a shameless defiance, \"I guess I'm gonna make a rotten tart. I was\nin a show, an' I got busted out for not bein' nice to the manager. I\nsays to myself: 'Well, what am I gonna do?' An' I starts to get hungry\nthis morning. So I says to myself: 'Well, there ain't but one thing to\ndo, Charlotte, but to get you a room,' I says, an' here I am, so help me\nGod.\"\n\nShe removed her dress with a sweeping motion. Hugo looked at her, filled\nwith pity, filled with remorse at his sudden surrender to her passionate\ngood looks, intensely discomfited.\n\n\"Listen. I have a roll in my pocket. I'm damn glad I came here first. I\nhaven't got a job, but I'll get one in the morning. And I'll get you a\ndecent room and stake you till you get work. God knows, I picked you up\nfor what I thought you were, Charlotte, and God knows too that I haven't\nany noble nature. But I'm not going to let you go on the street simply\nbecause you're broke. Not when you hate it so much.\"\n\nCharlotte shut her eyes tight and pressed out the last tears, which ran\ninto her rouge and streaked it with mascara. \"That's sure white of you.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe it's selfish. I had an awful yen for you when I sat\ndown at that table. But let's not worry about it now. Let's go out and\nget a decent dinner.\"\n\n\"You mean--you mean you want me to go out and eat--now?\"\n\n\"Sure. Why not?\"\n\n\"But you ain't--?\"\n\n\"Forget it. Come on.\"\n\nCharlotte sniffled and buried her black tresses in her black dress. She\npulled it over the curves of her hips. She inspected herself in a\nspotted mirror and sniffled again. Then she laughed. A throaty, gurgling\nlaugh. Her hands moved swiftly, and soon she turned. \"How am I?\"\n\n\"Wonderful.\"\n\n\"Let's go!\"\n\nShe tucked her hand under his arm when they reached the street. Hugo\nwalked silently. He wondered why he was doing it and to what it would\nlead. It seemed good, wholly good, to have a girl at his side again,\nespecially a girl over whom he had so strong a claim. They stopped\nbefore a glass-fronted restaurant that advertised its sea food and its\nsteaks. She sat down with an apologetic smile. \"I'm afraid I'm goin' to\neat you out of house and home.\"\n\n\"Go ahead. I had a big supper, but I'll string along with some pie and\ncheese and beer.\"\n\nCharlotte studied the menu. \"Mind if I have a little steak?\"\n\nHugo shook his head slowly. \"Waiter! A big T-bone, and some lyonnaise\npotatoes, and some string beans and corn and a salad and ice cream.\nBring some pie and cheese for me--and a beer.\"\n\n\"Gosh!\" Charlotte said.\n\nHugo watched her eat the food. He knew such pity as he had seldom felt.\nPoor little kid! All alone, scared, going on the street because she\nwould starve otherwise. It made him feel strong and capable. Before the\nmeal was finished, she was talking furiously. Her pathetic life was\nunravelled. \"I come from Brooklyn ... old man took to drink, an' ma beat\nit with a gent from Astoria ... never knew what happened to her.... I\nkept house for the old man till he tried to get funny with me....\nBurlesque ... on the road ... the leading man.... He flew the coop when\nI told him, and then when it came, it was dead....\" Another job ... the\nmanager ... Coney and her dismissal. \"I just couldn't let 'em have it\nwhen I didn't like 'em, mister. Guess I'm not tough like the other\ngirls. My mother was French and she brought me up kind of decent.\nWell....\" The little outward turning of her hands, the shrug of her\nshoulders.\n\n\"Don't worry, Charlotte. I won't let them eat you. To-morrow I'll set\nyou up to a decent room and we'll go out and find some jobs here.\"\n\n\"You don't have to do that, mister. I'll make out. All I needed was a\nsquare and another day.\"\n\nCharlotte sighed and smoked a cigarette with her coffee. Then they went\nout on the street and mixed with the throng. The voices of a score of\nbarkers wheedled them. Hugo began to feel gay. He took Charlotte to see\nthe strong man and watched his feats with a critical eye. He took her on\nthe roller coaster and became taut and laughing when she screamed and\nheld him. Then, laughing louder than before, they went through\nSteeplechase. She fell in the rolling barrel and he carried her out.\nThey crossed over moving staircases and lost themselves in a maze, and\nslid down polished chutes into fountains of light and excited screaming.\nAlways, afterwards, her hand found his arm, her great dark eyes looked\ninto his and laughed. Always they turned toward the other men and girls\nwith a proud and haughty expression that pointed to Hugo as her man, her\nconquest. Later they danced. They drank more beer.\n\n\"Golly,\" she whispered, as she snuggled against him, \"you sure strut a\nmean fox trot.\"\n\n\"So do you, Charlotte.\"\n\n\"I been doin' it a lot, I guess.\"\n\nThe brazen crash of a finale. The table. A babble of voices, voices of\npeople snatching pleasure from Coney Island's gaudy barrel of cheap\namusements. Hugo liked it then. He liked the smell and touch of the\nmultitude and the incessant hysteria of its presence. After midnight the\nmusic became more aggravating--muted, insinuating. Several of the\ndancers were drunk. One of them tried to cut in. Hugo shook his head.\n\n\"Gee!\" Charlotte said, \"I was sure hopin' you wouldn't let him.\"\n\n\"Why--I never thought of it.\"\n\n\"Most fellows would. He's a tough.\"\n\nIt was an introduction to an unfamiliar world. The \"tough\" came to their\ntable and asked for a dance in thick accents. Charlotte paled and\naccepted. Hugo refused. \"Say, bo, I'm askin' for a dance. I got\nconcessions here. You can't refuse me, see? I guess you got me wrong.\"\n\n\"Beat it,\" Hugo said, \"before I take a poke at you.\"\n\nThe intruder's answer was a swinging fist, which missed Hugo by a wide\nmargin. Hugo stood and dropped him with a single clean blow. The manager\ncame up, expostulated, ordered the tough's inert form from the floor,\nstarted the music.\n\n\"You shouldn't ought to have done it, mister. He'll get his gang.\"\n\n\"The hell with his gang.\"\n\nCharlotte sighed. \"That's the first time anybody ever stuck up for me.\nJeest, mister, I've been wishin' an' wishin' for the day when somebody\nwould bruise his knuckles for me.\"\n\nHugo laughed. \"Hey, waiter! Two beers.\"\n\nWhen she yawned, he took her out to the boulevard and walked at her side\ntoward the shabby house. They reached the steps, and Charlotte began to\ncry.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I was goin' to thank you, but I don't know how. It was too nice of you.\nAn' now I suppose I'll never see you again.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. I'll show up at eight in the morning and we'll have\nbreakfast together.\"\n\nCharlotte looked into his face wistfully. \"Say, kid, be a good guy and\ntake me to your hotel, will you? I'm scared I'll lose you.\"\n\nHe held her hands. \"You won't lose me. And I haven't got a hotel--yet.\"\n\n\"Then--come up an' stay with me. Honest, I'm all right. I can prove it\nto you. It'll be doin' me a favor.\"\n\n\"I ought not to, Charlotte.\"\n\nShe threw her arms around him and kissed him. He felt her breath on his\nlips and the warmth of her body. \"You gotta, kid. You're all I ever had.\nPlease, please.\"\n\nHugo walked up the stairs thoughtfully. In her small room he watched her\ndisrobe. So willingly now--so eagerly. She turned back the covers of the\nbed. \"It ain't much of a dump, baby, but I'll make you like it.\"\n\nMuch later, in the abyss of darkness, he heard her voice, sleepy and\nstill husky. \"Say, mister, what's your name?\"\n\nIn the morning they went down to the boulevard together. The gay d\u00e9bris\nof the night before lay in the street, and men were sweeping it away.\nBut their spirits were high. They had breakfast together in a quiet\nenchantment. Once she kissed him.\n\n\"Would you like to keep house--for me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do you mean it?\" She seemed to doubt every instant that good fortune\nhad descended permanently upon her. She was like a dreamer who\nanticipated a sombre awakening even while he clung to the bliss of his\ndream.\n\n\"Sure, I mean it. I'll get a job and we'll find an apartment and you can\nspend your spare time swimming and lying on the beach.\" He knew a twinge\nof unexpected jealousy. \"That is, if you'll promise not to look at all\nthe men who are going to look at you.\" He was ashamed of that statement.\n\nCharlotte, however, was not sufficiently civilized to be displeased. \"Do\nyou think I'd two-time the first gent that ever worried about what I did\nin my spare moments? Why, if you brought home a few bucks to most of the\nbirds I know, they wouldn't even ask how you earned it--they'd be so\nbusy lookin' for another girl an' a shot of gin.\"\n\n\"Well--let's go.\"\n\nHugo went to one of the largest side shows. After some questioning he\nfound the manager. \"I'm H. Smith,\" he said, \"and I want to apply for a\njob.\"\n\n\"Doin' what?\"\n\n\"This is my wife.\" The manager stared and nodded. Charlotte took his arm\nand rubbed it against herself, thinking, perhaps, that it was a wifely\ngesture. Hugo smiled inwardly and then looked at the sprawled form of\nthe manager. There, to that seamy-faced and dour man who was almost\nunlike a human being, he was going to offer the first sale of his\nmajestic strength. A side-show manager, sitting behind a dirty desk in a\ndirty building.\n\n\"A strong-man act,\" Hugo said.\n\nCharlotte tittered. She thought that the bravado of her new friend was\nover-stepping the limits of good sense. The manager sat up. \"I'd like to\nhave a good strong man, yes. The show needs one. But you're not the\nbird. You haven't got the beef. Go over and watch that damned German\nwork.\"\n\nHugo bent over and fastened one hand on the back of the chair on which\nthe manager sat. Without evidence of effort he lifted the chair and its\noccupant high over his head.\n\n\"For Christ's sake, let me down,\" the manager said.\n\nHugo swung him through the air in a wide arc. \"I say, mister, that I'm\nthree times stronger than that German. And I want your job. If I don't\nlook strong enough, I'll wear some padded tights. And I'll give you a\nshow that'll be worth the admission. But I want a slice of the entrance\nprice--and maybe a separate tent, see? My name is Hogarth\"--he winked at\nCharlotte--\"and you'll never be sorry you took me on.\"\n\nThe manager, panting and astonished, was returned to the floor. His\nanger struggled with his pleasure at Hugo's showmanship. \"Well, what\nelse can you do? Weight-lifting is pretty stale.\"\n\nHugo thought quickly. \"I can bend a railroad rail--not a spike. I can\nlift a full-grown horse with one--one shoulder. I can chin myself on my\nlittle finger. I can set a bear trap with my teeth--\"\n\n\"That's a good number.\"\n\n\"I can push up just twice as much weight as any one else in the game and\nyou can print a challenge on my tent. I can pull a boa constrictor\nstraight--\"\n\n\"We'll give you a chance. Come around here at three this afternoon with\nyour stuff and we'll try your act. Does this lady work in it? That'll\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Charlotte said.\n\nHugo nodded. \"She's my assistant.\"\n\nThey left the building, and when she was sure they were out of earshot,\nCharlotte said: \"What do you do, strong boy, fake 'em?\"\n\n\"No. I do them.\"\n\n\"Aw--you don't need to kid me.\"\n\n\"I'm not. You saw me lift him, didn't you? Well--that was nothing.\"\n\n\"Jeest! That I should live to see the day I got a bird like you.\"\n\nUntil three o'clock Hugo and Charlotte occupied their time with feverish\nactivity. They found a small apartment not far from the sea-shore. It\nwas clean and bright and it had windows on two sides. Its furniture was\nnearly new, and Charlotte, with tears in her eyes, sat in all the\nchairs, lay on the bed, took the egg-beater from the drawer in the\nkitchen table and spun it in an empty bowl. They went out together and\nbought a quantity and a variety of food. They ate an early luncheon and\nHugo set out to gather the properties for his demonstration. At three\no'clock, before a dozen men, he gave an exhibition of strength the like\nof which had never been seen in any museum of human abnormalities.\n\nWhen he went back to his apartment, Charlotte, in a gingham dress which\nshe had bought with part of the money he had given her, was preparing\ndinner. He took her on his lap. \"Did you get the job?\"\n\n\"Sure I did. Fifty a week and ten per cent of the gate receipts.\"\n\n\"Gee! That's a lot of money!\"\n\nHugo nodded and kissed her. He was very happy. Happier, in a certain\nway, than he had ever been or ever would be again. His livelihood was\nassured. He was going to live with a woman, to have one always near to\nlove and to share his life. It was that concept of companionship, above\nall other things, which made him glad.\n\nTwo days later, as Hugo worked to prepare the vehicles of his\nexhibition, he heard an altercation outside the tent that had been\nerected for him. A voice said: \"Whatcha tryin' to do there, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Why, I was making this strong man as I saw him. A man with the\nexpression of strength in his face.\"\n\n\"But you gotta bat' robe on him. What we want is muscles. Muscles, bo.\nBigger an' better than any picture of any strong man ever made. Put one\nhere--an' one there--\"\n\n\"But that isn't correct anatomy.\"\n\n\"To hell wit' that stuff. Put one there, I says.\"\n\n\"But he'll be out of drawing, awkward, absurd.\"\n\n\"Say, listen, do you want ten bucks for painting this sign or shall I\ngive it to some one else?\"\n\n\"Very well. I'll do as you say. Only--it isn't right.\"\n\nHugo walked out of the tent. A young man was bending over a huge sheet\nmade of many lengths of oilcloth sewn together. He was a small person,\nwith pale eyes and a white skin. Beside him stood the manager, eyeing\ncritically the strokes applied to the cloth. In a semi-finished state\nwas the young man's picture of the imaginary Hogarth.\n\n\"That's pretty good,\" Hugo said.\n\nThe young man smiled apologetically. \"It isn't quite right. You can see\nfor yourself you have no muscles there--and there. I suppose you're\nHogarth?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well--I tried to explain the anatomy of it, but Mr. Smoots says anatomy\ndoesn't matter. So here we go.\" He made a broad orange streak.\n\nHugo smiled. \"Smoots is not an anatomical critic of any renown. I say,\nSmoots, let him paint it as he sees best. God knows the other posters\nare atrocious enough.\"\n\nThe youth looked up from his work. \"Good God, don't tell me you're\nreally Hogarth!\"\n\n\"Sure. Why not?\"\n\n\"Well--well--I--I guess it was your English.\"\n\n\"That's funny. And I don't blame you.\" Hugo realized that the young\nsign-painter was a person of some culture. He was about Hugo's age,\nalthough he seemed younger on first glance. \"As a matter of fact, I'm a\ncollege man.\" Smoots had moved away. \"But, for the love of God, don't\ntell any one around here.\"\n\nThe painter stopped. \"Is that so! And you're doing this--to make money?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be doggoned. Me, too. I study at the School of Design in the\nwinter, and in the summer I come out here to do signs and lightning\nportraits and whatever else I can to make the money for it. Sometimes,\"\nhe added, \"I pick up more than a thousand bucks in a season. This is my\nfourth year at it.\"\n\nThere was in the young artist's eye a hint of amusement, a suggestion\nthat they were in league. Hugo liked him. He sat down on a box. \"Live\nhere?\"\n\n\"Yes. Three blocks away.\"\n\n\"Me, too. Why not come up and have supper with--my wife and me?\"\n\n\"Are you married?\" The artist commenced work again.\n\nHugo hesitated. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Sure I'll come up. My name's Valentine Mitchel. I can't shake hands\njust now. It's been a long time since I've talked to any one who doesn't\nsay 'deez' and 'doze.'\"\n\nWhen, later in the day, they walked toward Hugo's home, he was at a loss\nto explain Charlotte. The young painter would not understand why he, a\ncollege man, chose so ignorant a mate. On the other hand, he owed it to\nCharlotte to keep their secret and he was not obliged to make any\nexplanation.\n\nValentine Mitchel was, however, a young man of some sensitivity. If he\nwinced at Charlotte's \"Pleased to meetcher,\" he did not show it. Later,\nafter an excellent and hilarious meal, he must have guessed the\nsituation. He went home reluctantly and Hugo was delighted with him. He\nhad been urbane and filled with anecdotes of Greenwich Village and\nart-school life, of Paris, whither his struggling footsteps had taken\nhim for a hallowed year. And with his acceptance of Hugo came an equally\nwarm pleasure in Charlotte's company.\n\n\"He's a good little kid,\" Charlotte said.\n\n\"Yes. I'm glad I picked him up.\"\n\nThe gala opening of Hogarth's Studio of Strength took place a few nights\nafterwards. It proved even more successful than Smoots had hoped. The\nflamboyant advertising posters attracted crowds to see the man who could\nset a bear trap with his teeth, who could pull an angry boa constrictor\ninto a straight line. Before ranks of gaping faces that were supplanted\nby new ranks every hour, Hugo performed. Charlotte, resplendent in a\nblack dress that left her knees bare, and a red sash that all but\nobliterated the dress, helped Hugo with his ponderous props, setting off\nhis strength by contrast, and sold the pamphlets Hugo had written at\nSmoots's suggestion--pamphlets that purported to give away the secret\nof Hogarth's phenomenal muscle power. Valentine Mitchel watched the\nentire performance.\n\nWhen it was over, he said to Hugo: \"Now you better beat it back and get\na hot bath. You're probably all in.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Charlotte said. \"Come. I myself will bathe you.\"\n\nHugo grinned. \"Hell, no. Now we're all going on a bender to celebrate.\nWe'll eat at Villapigue's and we'll take a moonlight sail.\"\n\nThey went together, marvelling at his vitality, gay, young, and living\nin a world that they managed to forget did not exist. The night was\nwarm. The days that followed were warmer. The crowds came and the brassy\nmusic hooted and coughed over them night and day.\n\nThere are, in the lives of almost every man and woman, certain brief\nepisodes that, enduring for a long or a short time, leave in the memory\na sense of completeness. To those moments humanity returns for refuge,\nfor courage, and for solace. It was of such material that Hugo's next\ntwo months were composed. The items of it were nearly all sensuous: the\nsound of the sea when he sat in the sand late at night with Charlotte;\nthe whoop and bellow of the merry-go-round that spun and glittered\nacross the street from his tent; the inarticulate breathing and the\nwhite-knuckled clenchings of the crowd as it lifted its face to his\nefforts, for each of which he assumed a slow, painful motion that\nexaggerated its difficulty; the smell of the sea, intermingled with a\nthousand man-made odors; the faint, pervasive scent of Charlotte that\nclung to him, his clothes, his house; the pageant of the people, always\nin a huge parade, going nowhere, celebrating nothing but the functions\nof living, loud, garish, cheap, splendid; breakfasts at his table with\nhis woman's voluptuousness abated in the bright sunlight to little more\nthan a reminiscence and a promise; the taste of beer and pop-corn and\nfrankfurters and lobster and steak; the affable, talkative company of\nValentine Mitchel.\n\nOnly once that he could recall afterwards did he allow his intellect to\nact in any critical direction, and that was in a conversation with the\nyoung artist. They were sitting together in the sand, and Charlotte,\nbrowned by weeks of bathing, lay near by. \"Here I am,\" Mitchel said with\nan unusual thoughtfulness, \"with a talent that should be recognized,\nwanting to be an illustrator, able to be one, and yet forced to dawdle\nwith this horrible business to make my living.\"\n\nHugo nodded. \"You'll come through--some winter--and you won't ever\nreturn to Coney Island.\"\n\n\"I know it. Unless I do it for sentimental reasons some day--in a\nlimousine.\"\n\n\"It's myself,\" Hugo said then, \"and not you who is doomed to--well, to\nthis sort of thing. You have a talent that is at least understandable\nand--\" he was going to say mediocre. He checked himself--\"applicable in\nthe world of human affairs. My talent--if it is a talent--has no place,\nno application, no audience.\"\n\nMitchel stared at Hugo, wondering first what that talent might be and\nthen recognizing that Hugo meant his strength. \"Nonsense. Any male in\nhis right senses would give all his wits to be as strong as you are.\"\n\nIt was a polite, friendly thing to say. Hugo could not refrain from\ncomparing himself to Valentine Mitchel. An artist--a clever artist and\none who would some day be important to the world. Because people could\nunderstand what he drew, because it represented a level of thought and\nexpression. He was, like Hugo, in the doldrums of progress. But Mitchel\nwould emerge, succeed, be happy--or at least satisfied with\nhimself--while Hugo was bound to silence, was compelled never to allow\nhimself full expression. Humanity would never accept and understand him.\nThey were not similar people, but their case was, at that instant,\nironically parallel. \"It isn't only being strong,\" he answered\nmeditatively, \"but it's knowing what to do with your strength.\"\n\n\"Why--there are a thousand things to do.\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\nMitchel raised himself on his elbows and turned his water-coloured eyes\non the populous beach. \"Well--well--let's see. You could, of course, be\na strong man and amuse people--which you're doing. You could--oh, there\nare lots of things you could do.\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"I've been thinking about them--for years. And I can't\ndiscover any that are worth the effort.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\"\n\nCharlotte moved close to him. \"There's one thing you can do, honey, and\nthat's enough for me.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" Hugo said with a seriousness the other two did not perceive.\n\nThe increased heat of August suggested by its very intensity a shortness\nof duration, an end of summer. Hugo began to wonder what he would do\nwith Charlotte when he went back to Webster. He worried about her a good\ndeal and she, guessing the subject of his frequent fits of silence, made\na resolve in her tough and worldly mind. She had learned more about\ncertain facets of Hugo than he knew himself. She realized that he was\nsuperior to her and that, in almost any other place than Coney Island,\nshe would be a liability to him. The thought that he would have to\ndesert her made Hugo very miserable. He knew that he would miss\nCharlotte and he knew that the blow to her might spell disaster. After\nall, he thought, he had not improved her morals or raised her vision. He\ndid not realize that he had made both almost sublime by the mere act of\nbeing considerate. \"White,\" Charlotte called it.\n\nNevertheless she was not without an intense sense of self-protection,\ndespite her condition on the night he had found her. She knew that\nwomankind lived at the expense of mankind. She saw the emotional\nrespect in which Valentine Mitchel unwittingly held Hugo. He had\nscarcely spoken ten serious words to her. She realized that the artist\nsaw her as a property of his friend. That, in a way, made her valuable.\nIt was a subtle advantage, which she pressed with all the skill it\nrequired. One night when Hugo was at work and the chill of autumn had\nbreathed on the hot shore, she told Valentine that he was a very nice\nboy and that she liked him very much. He went away distraught, which was\nwhat she had intended, and he carried with him a new and as yet\ninarticulate idea, which was what she had foreseen.\n\nHe believed that he loved her. He told himself that Hugo was going to\ndesert her, that she would be forsaken and alone. At that point, she\nrecited to him the story of her life and the tale of her rescue by Hugo\nand said at the end that she would be very lonely when Hugo was gone.\nBecause Hugo had loved her, Mitchel thought she contained depths and\nvalues which did not appear. That she contained such depths neither man\nreally knew then. Both of them learned it much later. Mitchel found\nhimself in that very artistic dilemma of being in love with his friend's\nmistress. It terrified his romantic soul and it involved him\ninextricably.\n\nWhen she felt that the situation had ripened to the point of action, she\nwaited for the precise moment. It came swiftly and in a better guise\nthan she had hoped. On a night in early September, when the crowds had\nthinned a little, Hugo was just buckling himself into the harness that\nlifted the horse. The spectators were waiting for the d\u00e9nouement with\nbickering patience. Charlotte was standing on the platform, watching him\nwith expressionless eyes. She knew that soon she would not see Hugo any\nmore. She knew that he was tired of his small show, that he was chafing\nto be gone; and she knew that his loyalty to her would never let him go\nunless it was made inevitable by her. The horse was ready. She watched\nthe muscles start out beneath Hugo's tawny skin. She saw his lips set,\nhis head thrust back. She worshipped him like that. Unemotionally, she\nsaw the horse lifted up from the floor. She heard the applause. There\nwas a bustle at the gate.\n\nHalf a dozen people entered in single file. Three young men. Three\ngirls. They were intoxicated. They laughed and spoke in loud voices. She\nsaw by their clothes and their manner that they were rich. Slumming in\nConey Island. She smiled at the young men as she had always smiled at\nsuch young men, friendlily, impersonally. Hugo did not see their\nentrance. They came very near.\n\n\"My God, it's Hugo Danner!\"\n\nHugo heard Lefty's voice and recognized it. The horse was dropped to the\nfloor. He turned. An expression of startled amazement crossed his\nfeatures. Chuck, Lefty, Iris, and three people whom he did not know were\nstaring at him. He saw the stupefied recognition on the faces of his\nfriends. One despairing glance he cast at Charlotte and then he went on\nwith his act.\n\nThey waited for him until it was over. They clasped him to their bosoms.\nThey acknowledged Charlotte with critical glances. \"Come on and join the\nparty,\" they said.\n\nAfter that, their silence was worse than any questions. They talked\nfreely and merrily enough, but behind their words was a deep reserve.\nLefty broke it when he had an opportunity to take Hugo aside. \"What in\nhell is eating you? Aren't you coming back to Webster?\"\n\n\"Sure. That is--I think so. I had to do this to make some money. Just\nabout the time school closed, my family went broke.\"\n\n\"But, good God, man, why didn't you tell us? My father is an alumnus and\nhe'd put up five thousand a year, if necessary, to see you kept on the\nfootball team.\"\n\nHugo laughed. \"You don't think I'd take it, Lefty?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" A pause. \"No, I suppose you'd be just the God-damned kind of\na fool that wouldn't. Who's the girl?\"\n\nHugo did not falter. \"She's a tart I've been living with. I never knew a\nbetter one--girl, that is.\"\n\n\"Have you gone crazy?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I've got wise.\"\n\n\"Well, for Christ's sake, don't say anything about it on the campus.\"\n\nHugo bit his lip. \"Don't worry. My business is--my own.\"\n\nThey joined the others, drinking at the table. Charlotte was telling a\njoke. It was not a nice joke. He had not thought of her jokes\nbefore--because Iris and Chuck and Lefty had not been listening to them.\nNow, he was embarrassed. Iris asked him to dance with her. They went out\non the floor.\n\n\"Lovely little thing, that Charlotte,\" she said acidly.\n\n\"Isn't she!\" Hugo answered with such enthusiasm that she did not speak\nduring the rest of the dance.\n\nFinally the ordeal ended. Lefty and his guests embarked in an automobile\nfor the city.\n\n\"You know such people,\" Charlotte half-whispered. Hugo's cheeks still\nflamed, but his heart bled for her.\n\n\"I guess they aren't much,\" he replied.\n\nShe answered hotly: \"Don't you be like that! They're nice people.\nThey're fine people. That Iris even asked me to her house. Gave me a\ncard to see her.\" Charlotte could guess what Iris wanted. So could Hugo.\nBut Charlotte pretended to be innocent.\n\nHe kissed Charlotte good-night and walked in the streets until morning.\nHugo could see no solution. Charlotte was so trusting, so good to him.\nHe could not imagine how she would receive any suggestion that she go to\nNew York and get a job, while he returned to college, that he see her\nduring vacations, that he send money to her. But he knew that a hot\nfire dwelt within her and that her fury would rise, her grief, and that\nhe would be made very miserable and ashamed. She chided him at breakfast\nfor his walk in the dark. She laughed and kissed him and pushed him\nbodily to his work. He looked back as he walked down to the curb. She\nwas leaning out of the window. She waved her hand. He rounded the corner\nwith wretched, leaden steps. The morning, concerned with the petty\nbusiness of receipts, refurbishings, cleaning, went slowly. When he\nreturned for lunch it was with the decision to tell her the truth about\nhis life and its requirements and to let her decide.\n\nShe did not come to the door to kiss him. (She had imagined that lonely\nreturn.) She did not answer his brave and cheerful hail. (She had let\nthe sound of it ring upon her ear a thousand times.) She was gone. (She\nknew he would sit down and cry.) Then, stumbling, he found the two\nnotes. But he already understood.\n\nThe message from Valentine Mitchel was reckless, impetuous. \"Dear\nHugo--Charlotte and I have fallen in love with each other and I've run\naway with her. I almost wish you'd come after us and kill me. I hate\nmyself for betraying you. But I love her, so I cannot help it. I've\nlearned to see in her what you first saw in her. Good-bye, good luck.\"\n\nHugo put it down. Charlotte would be good to him. In a way, he didn't\ndeserve her. And when he was famous, some day, perhaps she would leave\nhim, too. He hesitated to read her note. \"Good-bye, darling, I do not\nlove you any more. C.\"\n\nIt was ludicrous, transparent, pitiful, and heroic. Hugo saw all those\nqualities. \"Good-bye, darling, I do not love you any more.\" She had\nwritten it under Valentine's eyes. But she was shrewd enough to placate\nher new lover while she told her sad little story to her old. She would\nwant him to feel bad. Well, God knew, he did. Hugo looked at the room.\nHe sobbed. He bolted into the street, tears streaming down his cheeks;\nhe drew his savings from the bank--seven hundred and eighty-four dollars\nand sixty-four cents; he rushed to the haunted house, flung his clothes\ninto a bag; he sat drearily on a subway for an hour. He paced the smooth\nfloor of a station. He swung aboard a train. He came to Webster, his\nhead high, feeling a great pride in Charlotte and in his love for her,\nwalking in glad strides over the familiar soil.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nHugo sat alone and marvelled at the exquisite torment of his\n_Weltschmertz_. Far away, across the campus, he heard singing. Against\nthe square segment of sky visible from the bay window of his room he\ncould see the light of the great fire they had built to celebrate\nvictory--his victory. The light leaped into the darkness above like a\ngreat golden ghost in some fantastic ascension, and beneath it, he knew,\na thousand students were dancing. They were druid priests at a rite to\nthe god of football. His fingers struggled through his black hair. The\nday was fresh in his mind--the bellowing stands, the taut, almost\nfrightened faces of the eleven men who faced him, the smack and flight\nof the brown oval, the lumbering sound of men running, the sucking of\nthe breath of men and their sharp, painful fall to earth.\n\nIn his mind was a sharp picture of himself and the eyes that watched him\nas he broke away time and again, with infantile ease, to carry that\nprecious ball. He let them make a touchdown that he could have averted.\nHe made one himself. Then another. The bell on Webster Hall was booming\nits p\u00e6an of victory. He stiffened under the steady monody. He remembered\nagain. Lefty barking signals with a strange agony in his voice. Lefty\npounding on his shoulder. \"Go in there, Hugo, and give it to them. I\ncan't.\" Lefty pleading. And the captain, Jerry Painter, cursing in open\njealousy of Hugo, vying hopelessly with Hugo Danner, the man who was a\ngod.\n\nIt was not fair. Not right. The old and early glory was ebbing from it.\nWhen he put down the ball, safely across the goal for the winning\ntouchdown, he saw three of the men on the opposing team lie down and\nweep. There he stood, pretending to pant, feigning physical distress,\nmaking himself a hero at the expense of innocent victims. Jackstraws for\na giant. There was no triumph in that. He could not go on.\n\nAfterwards they had made him speak, and the breathless words that had\nonce come so easily moved heavily through his mind. Yet he had carried\nhis advantage beyond the point of turning back. He could not say that\nthe opponents of Webster might as well attempt to hold back a\nJuggernaut, to throw down a siege-gun, to outrace light, as to lay their\nhands on him to check his intent. Webster had been good to him. He loved\nWebster and it deserved his best. His best! He peered again into the\ncelebrating night and wondered what that awful best would be.\n\nHe desired passionately to be able to give that--to cover the earth,\nmaking men glad and bringing a revolution into their lives, to work\nhimself into a fury and to fatigue his incredible sinews, to end with\nthe feeling of a race well run, a task nobly executed. And, for a year,\nthat ambition had seemed in some small way to be approaching fruition.\nNow it was turned to ashes. It was not with the muscles of men that his\ngoal was to be attained. They could not oppose him.\n\nAs he sat gloomy and distressed, he wondered for what reason there\nburned in him that wish to do great deeds. Humanity itself was too\nselfish and too ignorant to care. It could boil in its tiny prejudices\nfor centuries to come and never know that there could be a difference.\nMoreover, who was he to grind his soul and beat his thoughts for the\nbenefit of people who would never know and never care? What honour, when\nhe was dead, to lie beneath a slab on which was punily graven some note\nof mighty accomplishment? Why could he not content himself with the food\nhe ate, the sunshine, with wind in trees, and cold water, and a woman?\nIt was that sad and silly command within to transcend his vegetable self\nthat made him human. He tried to think about it bitterly: fool man,\ngrown suddenly more conscious than the other beasts--how quickly he had\nbecome vain because of it and how that vanity led him forever onward! Or\nwas it vanity--when his aching soul proclaimed that he would gladly\nachieve and die without other recognition or acclaim than that which\nrose within himself? Martyrs were made of such stuff. And was not that,\nperhaps, an even more exaggerated vanity? It was so pitiful to be a man\nand nothing more. Hugo bowed his head and let his body tremble with\nstrange agony. Perhaps, he thought, even the agony was a selfish\npleasure to him. Then he should be ashamed. He felt shame and then\nthought that the feeling rose from a wish for it and foundered angrily\nin the confusion of his introspection. He knew only and knew but dimly\nthat he would lift himself up again and go on, searching for some\nuniversal foe to match against his strength. So pitiful to be a man! So\nChrist must have felt in Gethsemane.\n\n\"Hey, Hugo!\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"What the hell did you come over here for?\"\n\n\"To be alone.\"\n\n\"Is that a hint?\" Lefty entered the room. \"They want you over at the\nbonfire. We've been looking all over for you.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll go. But, honest to God, I've had enough of this\nbusiness for to-day.\"\n\nLefty slapped Hugo's shoulders. \"The great must pay for their celebrity.\nCome on, you sap.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? Anything the matter?\"\n\n\"No. Nothing's the matter. Only--it's sort of sad to be--\" Hugo checked\nhimself.\n\n\"Sad? Good God, man, you're going stale.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's it.\" Hugo had a sudden fancy. \"Do you suppose I could be\nlet out of next week's game?\"\n\n\"What for? My God--\"\n\nHugo pursued the idea. \"It's the last game. I can sit on the lines. You\nfellows all play good ball. You can probably win. If you can't--then\nI'll play. If you only knew, Lefty, how tired I get sometimes--\"\n\n\"Tired! Why don't you say something about it? You can lay off practice\nfor three or four days.\"\n\n\"Not that. Tired in the head, not the body. Tired of crashing through\nand always getting away with it. Oh, I'm not conceited. But I know they\ncan't stop me. You know it. It's a gift of mine--and a curse. How about\nit? Let's start next week without me.\"\n\nThe night ended at last. A new day came. The bell on Webster Hall\nstopped booming. Woodie, the coach, came to see Hugo between classes.\n\"Lefty says you want us to start without you next week. What's the big\nidea?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I thought the other birds would like a shot at Yale\nwithout me. They can do it.\"\n\nMr. Woodman eyed his player. \"That's pretty generous of you, Hugo. Is\nthere any other reason?\"\n\n\"Not--that I can explain.\"\n\n\"I see.\" The coach offered Hugo a cigarette after he had helped himself.\n\"Take it. It'll do you good.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Listen, Hugo. I want to ask you a question. But, first, I want you to\npromise you'll give me a plain answer.\"\n\n\"I'll try.\"\n\n\"That won't do.\"\n\n\"Well--I can't promise.\"\n\nWoodman sighed. \"I'll ask it anyway. You can answer or not--just as you\nwish.\" He was silent. He inhaled his cigarette and blew the smoke\nthrough his nostrils. His eyes rested on Hugo with an expression of\nintense interest, beneath which was a softer light of something not\nunlike sympathy. \"I'll have to tell you something, first, Hugo. When you\nwent away last summer, I took a trip to Colorado.\"\n\nHugo started, and Woodman continued: \"To Indian Creek. I met your father\nand your mother. I told them that I knew you. I did my best to gain\ntheir confidence. You see, Hugo, I've watched you with a more skilful\neye than most people. I've seen you do things, a few little things, that\nweren't--well--that weren't--\"\n\nHugo's throat was dry. \"Natural?\"\n\n\"That's the best word, I guess. You were never like my other boys, in\nany case. So I thought I'd find out what I could. I must admit that my\nefforts with your father were a failure. Aside from the fact that he is\nan able biology teacher and that he had a number of queer theories years\nago, I learned nothing. But I did find out what those theories were. Do\nyou want me to stop?\"\n\nA peculiar, almost hopeful expression was on Hugo's face. \"No,\" he\nanswered.\n\n\"Well, they had to do with the biochemistry of cellular structure,\ndidn't they? And with the production of energy in cells? And then--I\ntalked to lots of people. I heard about Samson.\"\n\n\"Samson!\" Hugo echoed, as if the dead had spoken.\n\n\"Samson--the cat.\"\n\nHugo was as pale as chalk. His eyes burned darkly. He felt that his\nuniverse was slipping from beneath him. \"You know, then,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know, Hugo. I merely guessed. I was going to ask. Now I shall\nnot. Perhaps I do know. But I had another question, son--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Hugo looked at Woodman and felt then the reason for his success\nas a coach, as a leader and master of youth. He understood it.\n\n\"Well, I wondered if you thought it was worth while to talk to your\nfather and discover--\"\n\n\"What he did?\" Hugo suggested hoarsely.\n\nWoodman put his hand on Hugo's knee. \"What he did, son. You ought to\nknow by this time what it means. I've been watching you. I don't want\nyour head to swell, but you're a great boy, Hugo. Not only in beef. You\nhave a brain and an imagination and a sense of moral responsibility.\nYou'll come out better than the rest--you would even without your--your\nparticular talent. And I thought you might think that the rest of\nhumanity would profit--\"\n\nHugo jumped to his feet. \"No. A thousand times no. For the love of\nChrist--no! You don't know or understand, you can't conceive, Woodie,\nwhat it means to have it. You don't have the faintest idea of its\namount--what it tempts you with--what they did to me and I did to myself\nto beat it--if I have beaten it.\" He laughed. \"Listen, Woodie. Anything\nI want is mine. Anything I desire I can take. No one can hinder. And\nsometimes I sweat all night for fear some day I shall lose my temper.\nThere's a desire in me to break and destroy and wreck that--oh, hell--\"\n\nWoodman waited. Then he spoke quietly. \"You're sure, Hugo, that the\ndesire to be the only one--like that--has nothing to do with it?\"\n\nHugo's sole response was to look into Woodman's eyes, a look so pregnant\nwith meaning, so tortured, so humble, that the coach swore softly. Then\nhe held out his hand. \"Well, Hugo, that's all. You've been damn swell\nabout it. The way I hoped you would be. And I think my answer is plain.\nOne thing. As long as I live, I promise on my oath I'll never give you\naway or support any rumour that hurts your secret.\"\n\nEven Hugo was stirred to a consciousness of the strength of the other\nman's grip.\n\nSaturday. A shrill whistle. The thump of leather against leather. The\nroar of the stadium.\n\nHugo leaned forward. He watched his fellows from the bench. They rushed\nacross the field. Lefty caught the ball. Eddie Carter interfered with\nthe first man, Bimbo Gaines with the second. The third slammed Lefty\nagainst the earth. Three downs. Eight yards. A kick. New Haven brought\nthe ball to its twenty-one-yard line. The men in helmets formed again. A\ncoughing voice. Pandemonium. Again in line. The voice. The riot of\nfigures suddenly still. Again. A kick. Lefty with the ball, and Bimbo\nGaines leading him, his big body a shield. Down. A break and a run for\ntwenty-eight yards. Must have been Chuck. Good old Chuck. He'd be\nplaying the game of his life. Graduation next spring. Four, seven,\neleven, thirty-two, fifty-five. Hugo anticipated the spreading of the\nplayers. He looked where the ball would be thrown. He watched Minton,\nthe end, spring forward, saw him falter, saw the opposing quarterback\nrun in, saw Lefty thrown, saw the ball received by the enemy and moved\nup, saw the opposing back spilled nastily. His heart beat faster.\n\nNo score at the end of the first half. The third quarter witnessed the\ncrossing of Webster's goal. Struggling grimly, gamely, against a team\nthat was their superior without Hugo, against a team heartened by the\nknowledge that Hugo was not facing it, Webster's players were being\nbeaten. The goal was not kicked. It made the score six to nothing\nagainst Webster. Hugo saw the captain rip off his headgear and throw it\nangrily on the ground. He understood all that was going on in the minds\nof his team in a clear, although remote, way. They went out to show\nthat they could play the game without Hugo Danner. And they were not\nshowing what they had hoped to show. A few minutes later their opponents\nmade a second touchdown.\n\nThirteen to nothing. Mr. Woodman moved beside Hugo. \"They can't do\nit--and I don't altogether blame them. They've depended on you too much.\nIt's too bad. We all have.\"\n\nHugo nodded. \"Shall I go in?\"\n\nThe coach watched the next play. \"I guess you better.\"\n\nWhen Hugo entered the line, Jerry Painter and Lefty spoke to him in\nstrained tones. \"You've got to take it over, Hugo--all the way.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nThe men lined up. A tense silence had fallen on the Yale line. They knew\nwhat was going to happen. The signals were called, the ball shot back to\nLefty, Hugo began to run, the men in front rushed together, and Lefty\nstuffed the ball into Hugo's arms. \"Go on,\" he shouted. The touchdown\nwas made in one play. Hugo saw a narrow hole and scooted into it. A man\nmet his outstretched arm on the other side. Another. Hugo dodged twice.\nThe crescendo roar of the Webster section came to him dimly. He avoided\nthe safety man and ran to the goal. In the pandemonium afterwards, Jerry\nkicked the goal.\n\nA new kick-off. Hugo felt a hand on his shoulder. \"You've gotta break\nthis up.\" Hugo broke it up. He held Yale almost single-handed. They\nkicked back. Hugo returned the kick to the middle of the field. He did\nnot dare to do more.\n\nThen he stood in his leather helmet, bent, alert, waiting to run again.\nThey called the captain's signal. He made four yards. Then Lefty's. He\nmade a first down. Then Jerry's. Two yards. Six yards. Five yards.\nAnother first down. The stands were insane. Hugo was glad they were not\nusing him--glad until he saw Jerry Painter's face. It was pale with\nrage. Blood trickled across it from a small cut. Three tries failed.\nHugo spoke to him. \"I'll take it over, Jerry, if you say so.\"\n\nJerry doubled his fist and would have struck him if Hugo had not stepped\nback. \"God damn you, Danner, you come out here in the last few minutes\nall fresh and make us look like a lot of fools. I tell you, my team and\nI will take that ball across and not you with your bastard tricks.\"\n\n\"But, good God, man--\"\n\n\"You heard me.\"\n\n\"This is your last down.\"\n\nThere was time for nothing more. Lefty called Jerry's signal, and Jerry\nfailed. The other team took the ball, rushed it twice, and kicked back\ninto the Webster territory. Again the tired, dogged players began a\nmarch forward. The ball was not given to Hugo. He did his best, using\nhis body as a ram to open holes in the line, tripping tacklers with his\nbody, fighting within the limits of an appearance of human strength to\nget his teammates through to victory. And Jerry, still pale and profane,\ndrove the men like slaves. It was useless. If Hugo had dared more, they\nmight have succeeded. But they lost the ball again. It was only in the\nlast few seconds that an exhausted and victorious team relinquished the\nball to Webster.\n\nJerry ordered his own number again. Hugo, cold and somewhat furious at\nthe vanity and injustice of the performance, gritted his teeth. \"How\nabout letting me try, Jerry? I can make it. It's for Webster--not for\nyou.\"\n\n\"You go to hell.\"\n\nLefty said: \"You're out of your head, Jerry.\"\n\n\"I said I'd take it.\"\n\nFor one instant Hugo looked into his eyes. And in that instant the\ncaptain saw a dark and flickering fury that filled him with fear. The\nwhistle blew. And then Hugo, to his astonishment, heard his signal.\nLefty was disobeying the captain. He felt the ball in his arms. He ran\nsmoothly. Suddenly he saw a dark shadow in the air. The captain hit him\non the jaw with all his strength. After that, Hugo did not think\nlucidly. He was momentarily berserk. He ran into the line raging and\nupset it like a row of tenpins. He raced into the open. A single man,\nthirty yards away, stood between him and the goal. The man drew near in\nan instant. Hugo doubled his arm to slug him. He felt the arm\nstraighten, relented too late, and heard, above the chaos that was\nloose, a sudden, dreadful snap. The man's head flew back and he\ndropped. Hugo ran across the goal. The gun stopped the game. But, before\nthe avalanche fell upon him, Hugo saw his victim lying motionless on the\nfield. What followed was nightmare. The singing and the cheering. The\nparade. The smashing of the goal posts. The gradual descent of silence.\nA pause. A shudder. He realized that he had been let down from the\nshoulders of the students. He saw Woodman, waving his hands, his face a\ngraven mask. The men met in the midst of that turbulence.\n\n\"You killed him, Hugo.\"\n\nThe earth spun and rocked slowly. He was paying his first price for\nlosing his temper. \"Killed him?\"\n\n\"His neck was broken-in three places.\"\n\nSome of the others heard. They walked away. Presently Hugo was standing\nalone on the cinders outside the stadium. Lefty came up. \"I just heard\nabout it. Tough luck. But don't let it break you.\"\n\nHugo did not answer. He knew that he was guilty of a sort of murder. In\nhis own eyes it was murder. He had given away for one red moment to the\nleaping, lusting urge to smash the world. And killed a man. They would\nnever accuse him. They would never talk about it. Only Woodman, perhaps,\nwould guess the thing behind the murder--the demon inside Hugo that was\ntame, except then, when his captain in jealous and inferior rage had\nstruck him.\n\nIt was night. Out of deference to the body of the boy lying in the\nWebster chapel there was no celebration. Every ounce of glory and joy\nhad been drained from the victory. The students left Hugo to a solitude\nthat was more awful than a thousand scornful tongues. They thought he\nwould feel as they would feel about such an accident. They gave him\nrespect when he needed counsel. As he sat by himself, he thought that he\nshould tell them the truth, all of them, confess a crime and accept the\npunishment. Hours passed. At midnight Woodman called.\n\n\"There isn't much to say, Hugo. I'm sorry, you're sorry, we're all\nsorry. But it occurred to me that you might do something foolish--tell\nthese people all about it, for example.\"\n\n\"I was going to.\"\n\n\"Don't. They'd never understand. You'd be involved in a legal war that\nwould undoubtedly end in your acquittal. But it would drag in all your\nfriends--and your mother and father--particularly him. The papers would\ngo wild. You might, on the other hand, be executed as a menace. You\ncan't tell.\"\n\n\"It might be a good thing,\" Hugo answered bitterly.\n\n\"Don't let me hear you say that, you fool! I tell you, Hugo, if you go\ninto that business, I'll get up on the stand and say I knew it all the\ntime and I let a man play on my team when I was pretty sure that sooner\nor later he'd kill someone. Then I'll go to jail surely.\"\n\n\"You're a pretty fine man, Mr. Woodman.\"\n\n\"Hell!\"\n\n\"What shall I do?\" Hugo's voice trembled. He suffered as he had not\ndreamed it was possible to suffer.\n\n\"That's up to you. I'd say, live it down.\"\n\n\"Live it down! Do you know what that means--in a college?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I do, Hugo.\"\n\n\"You can live down almost anything, except that one thing--murder. It's\ntoo ugly, Woodie.\"\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe. You've got to decide, son. If you decide against\ntrying--and, mind you, you might be justified--I've got a brother-in-law\nwho has a ranch in Alberta. A couple of hundred miles from any place.\nYou'd be welcome there.\"\n\nHugo did not reply. He took the coach's hand and wrung it. Then for an\nhour the two men sat side by side in the darkness. At last Woodman rose\nand left. He said only: \"Remember that offer. It's cold and bleak and\nthe work is hard. Good-night, Hugo.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Woodie. Thanks for coming up.\"\n\nWhen the campus was still with the quiet of sleep, Hugo crossed it as\nswiftly as a spectre. All night he strode remorselessly over country\nroads. His face was set. His eyes burned. He ignored the trembling of\nhis joints. When the sky faded, he went back. He packed his clothes in\ntwo suit-cases. With them swinging at his side, he stole out of the Psi\nDelta house, crossed the campus, stopped. For a long instant he stared\nat Webster Hall. The first light of morning was just touching it. The\nd\u00e9bris collected for a fire that was never lighted was strewn around the\ncannon. He saw the initials he had painted there a year and more ago\nstill faintly legible. A lump rose in his throat.\n\n\"Good-by, Webster,\" he said. He lifted the suitcase and vanished. In a\nfew minutes the campus was five miles behind him--six--ten--twenty. When\nhe saw the first early caravan of produce headed toward the market, he\nslowed to a walk. The sun came over a hill and sparkled on a billion\ndrops of dew. A bird flew singing from his path. Hugo Danner had fled\nbeyond the gates of Webster.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nA year passed. In the harbour of Cristobal, at the northern end of the\nlocks, waiting for the day to open the great steel jaws that dammed the\nPacific from the Atlantic, the _Katrina_ pulled at her anchor chain in\nthe gentle swell. A few stars, liquid bright, hung in the tropical sky.\nA little puff of wind coming occasionally from the south carried the\nsmell of the jungle to the ship. The crew was awakening.\n\nA man with a bucket on a rope went to the rail and hauled up a brimming\npail from the warm sea. He splashed his face and hands into it. Then he\npoured it back and repeated the act of dipping up water.\n\n\"Hey!\" he said.\n\nAnother man joined him. \"Here. Swab off your sweat. Look yonder.\"\n\nThe dorsal fin of a shark rippled momentarily on the surface and dipped\nbeneath it. A third man appeared. He accepted the proffered water and\nwashed himself. His roving eye saw the shark as it rose for the second\ntime. He dried on a towel. The off-shore breeze stirred his dark hair.\nThere was a growth of equally dark beard on his tanned jaw and cheek.\nSteely muscles bulged under his shirt. His forearm, when he picked up\nthe pail, was corded like cable. A smell of coffee issued from the\ngalley, and the smoke of the cook's fire was wafted on deck for a\npungent moment. Two bells sounded. The music went out over the water in\nclear, humming waves.\n\nThe man who had come first from the forecastle leaned his buttocks\nagainst the rail. One end of it had been unhooked to permit the\ndischarge of mail. The rail ran, the man fell back, clawing, and then,\nthinking suddenly of the sharks, he screamed. The third man looked. He\nsaw his fellow-seaman go overboard. He jumped from where he stood,\nclearing the scuppers and falling through the air before the victim of\nthe slack rail had landed in the water. The two splashes were almost\nsimultaneous. A boatswain, hearing the cry, hastened to the scene. He\nsaw one man lifted clear of the water by the other, who was treading\nwater furiously. He shouted for a rope. He saw the curve and dip of a\nfin. The first man seized the rope and climbed and was pulled up. The\nsecond, his rescuer, dived under water as if aware of something there\nthat required his attention. The men above him could not know that he\nhad felt the rake of teeth across his leg--powerful teeth, which\nnevertheless did not penetrate his skin. As he dived into the green\ndepths, he saw a body lunge toward him, turn, yawn a white-fringed\nmouth. He snatched the lower jaw in one hand, and the upper in the\nother. He exerted his strength. The mouth gaped wider, a tail twelve\nfeet behind it lashed, the thing died with fingers like steel claws\ntearing at its brain. It floated belly up. The man rose, took the rope,\nclimbed aboard. Other sharks assaulted the dead one.\n\nThe dripping sailor clasped his saviour's hand. \"God Almighty, man, you\nsaved my life. Jesus!\"\n\n\"That's four,\" Hugo Danner said abstractedly, and then he smiled. \"It's\nall right. Forget it. I've had a lot of experience with sharks.\" He had\nnever seen one before in his life. He walked aft, where the men grouped\naround him.\n\n\"How'd you do it?\"\n\n\"It's a trick I can't explain very well,\" Hugo said. \"You use their rush\nto break their jaws. It takes a good deal of muscle.\"\n\n\"Anyway--guy--thanks.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nA whistle blew. The ships were lining up in the order of their arrival\nfor admission to the Panama Canal. Gatun loomed in the feeble sun of\ndawn. The anchor chain rumbled. The _Katrina_ edged forward at half\nspeed.\n\nThe sea. Blue, green, restless, ghost-ridden, driven in empty quarters\nby devils riding the wind, secretive, mysterious, making a last\ngigantic, primeval stand against the conquest of man, hemming and\nisolating the world, beautiful, horrible, dead god of ten thousand\nvoices, universal incubator, universal grave.\n\nThe _Katrina_ came to the islands in the South Pacific. Islands that\nissued from the water like green wreaths and seemed to float on it. The\nsmall boats were put out and sections of the cargo were sent to rickety\nwharves where white men and brown islanders took charge of it and\ncarried it away into the fringe of the lush vegetation. Hugo, looking at\nthose islands, was moved to smile. The place where broken men hid from\ncivilization, where the derelicts of the world gathered to drown their\nshame in a verdant paradise that had no particular position in the white\nman's scheme of the earth.\n\nAt one of the smaller islands an accident to the engine forced the\n_Katrina_ to linger for two weeks. It was during those two weeks, in a\nrather extraordinary manner, that Hugo Danner laid the first foundation\nof the fortune that he accumulated in his later life. One day, idling\naway a leave on shore in the shade of a mighty tree, he saw the\noutriggers of the natives file away for the oyster beds, and, out of\npure curiosity, he followed them. For a whole day he watched the men\nplunge under the surface in search of pearls. The next day he came back\nand dove with one of them.\n\nOn the bizarre floor of the ocean, among the colossal fronds of its\nflora, the two men swam. They were invaders from the brilliance above\nthe surface, shooting like fish, horizontally, through the murk and\nshadow, and the denizens of that world resented their coming. Great fish\nshot past them with malevolent eyes, and the vises of giant clams shut\nswiftly in attempts to trap their moving limbs. Hugo was entranced. He\nwatched the other man as he found the oyster bed and commenced to fill\nhis basket with frantic haste. When his lungs stung and he could bear\nthe agony no longer, he turned and forged toward the upper air. Then\nthey went down again.\n\nHugo's blood, designed to take more oxygen from the air, and his greater\ndensity fitted him naturally for the work. The pressure did not make him\nsuffer and the few moments granted to the divers beneath the forbidding\nelement stretched to a longer time for him.\n\nOn the second day of diving he went alone. His amateur attempt had been\nsurprisingly fruitful. Standing erect in the immense solitude, he\nsearched the hills and valleys. At length, finding a promising cluster\nof shellfish, he began to examine them one by one, pulling them loose,\nfeeling in their pulpy interior for the precious jewels. He occupied\nhimself determinedly while the _Katrina_ was waiting in Apia, and at the\nend of the stay he had collected more than sixty pearls of great value\nand two hundred of moderate worth.\n\nIt was, he thought, typical of himself. He had decided to make a fortune\nof some sort after the first bitter rage over his debacle at Webster had\nabated in his heart. He realized that without wealth his position in\nthe world would be more difficult and more futile than his fates had\ndecreed. Poverty, at least, he was not forced to bear. He could wrest\nfortune from nature by his might. That he had begun that task by diving\nfor pearls fitted into his scheme. It was such a method as no other man\nwould have considered and its achievement robbed no one while it\nenriched him.\n\nWhen the _Katrina_ turned her prow westward again, Hugo worked with his\nshipmates in a mood that had undergone considerable change. There was no\nmore despair in him, little of the taciturnity that had marked his\nearliest days at sea, none of the hatred of mankind. He had buried that\nslowly and carefully in a dull year of work ashore and a month of toil\non the heaving deck of the ship. For six months he had kept himself\nalive in a manner that he could scarcely remember. Driving a truck.\nWorking on a farm. Digging in a road. His mind a bitter blank, his\nvaliant dreams all dead.\n\nOne day he had saved a man's life. The reaction to that was small, but\nit was definite. The strength that could slay was also a strength that\ncould succour. He had repeated the act some time later. He felt it was a\nkind of atonement. After that, he sought deliberately to go where he\nmight be of assistance. In the city, again, in September, when a fire\nengine clanged and whooped through the streets, he followed and carried\na woman from a blazing roof as if by a miracle. Then the seaman. He had\ncounted four rescues by that time. Perhaps his self-condemnation for the\nboy who had fallen on the field at Webster could be stifled eventually.\nHuman life seemed very precious to Hugo then.\n\nHe sold his pearls when the ship touched at large cities--a handful here\nand a dozen there, bargaining carefully and forwarding the profit to a\nbank in New York. He might have continued that voyage, which was a\nvoyage commenced half in new recognition of his old wish to see and know\nthe world and half in the quest of forgetfulness; but a slip and shifts\nin the history of the world put an abrupt end to it. When the _Katrina_\nrounded the Bec d'Aiglon and steamed into the blue and cocoa harbour of\nMarseilles, Hugo heard that war had been declared by Germany, Austria,\nFrance, Russia, England....\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nIn a day the last veil of mist that had shrouded his feelings and\nthoughts, making them numb and sterile, vanished; in a day Hugo found\nhimself--or believed that he had; in a day his life changed and flung\nitself on the course which, in a measure, destined its fixation. He\nnever forgot that day.\n\nIt began in the early morning when the anchor of the freighter thundered\ninto the harbour water. The crew was not given shore leave until noon.\nThen the mysterious silence of the captain and the change in the ship's\ncourse was explained. Through the third officer he sent a message to the\nseamen. War had been declared. The seaways were unsafe. The _Katrina_\nwould remain indefinitely at Marseilles. The men could go ashore. They\nwould report on the following day.\n\nThe first announcement of the word sent Hugo's blood racing. War! What\nwar? With whom? Why? Was America in it, or interested in it? He stepped\nashore and hurried into the city. The populace was in feverish\nexcitement. Soldiers were everywhere, as if they had sprung up magically\nlike the seed of the dragon. Hugo walked through street after street in\nthe furious heat. He bought a paper and read the French accounts of\nmobilizations, of a battle impending. He looked everywhere for some one\nwho could tell him. Twice he approached the American Consulate, but it\nwas jammed with frantic and frightened people who were trying only to\nget away. Hugo's ambition, growing in him like a fire, was in the\nopposite direction. War! And he was Hugo Danner!\n\nHe sat at a caf\u00e9 toward the middle of the afternoon. He was so excited\nby the contagion in his veins that he scarcely thrilled at the first use\nof his new and half-mastered tongue. The _gar\u00e7on_ hurried to his table.\n\n\"_De la bi\u00e8re_,\" Hugo said.\n\nThe waiter asked a question which Hugo could not understand, so he\nrepeated his order in the universal language of measurement of a large\nglass by his hands. The waiter nodded. Hugo took his beer and stared out\nat the people. They hurried along the sidewalk, brushing the table at\nwhich he sat. They called to each other, laughed, cried sometimes, and\nshook hands over and over. \"_La guerre_\" was on every tongue. Old men\ngestured the directions of battles. Young men, a little more serious\nperhaps, and often very drunk, were rushing into uniform as order\nfollowed order for mobilization. And there were girls, thousands of\nthem, walking with the young men.\n\nHugo wanted to be in it. He was startled by the impact of that desire.\nAll the ferocity of him, all the unleashed wish to rend and kill, was\nblazing in his soul. But it was a subtle conflagration, which urged him\nin terms of duty, in words that spoke of the war as his one perfect\nopportunity to put himself to a use worthy of his gift. A war. In a war\nwhat would hold him, what would be superior to him, who could resist\nhim? He swallowed glass after glass of the brackish beer, quenching a\nmighty thirst and firing a mightier ambition. He saw himself charging\ninto battle, fighting till his ammunition was gone, till his bayonet\nbroke; and then turning like a Titan and doing monster deeds with bare\nhands. And teeth.\n\nBands played and feet marched. His blood rose to a boiling-point. A\nFrenchman flung himself at Hugo's table. \"And you--why aren't you a\nsoldier?\"\n\n\"I will be,\" Hugo replied.\n\n\"Bravo! We shall revenge ourselves.\" The man gulped a glass of wine,\nslapped Hugo's shoulder, and was gone. Then a girl talked to Hugo. Then\nanother man.\n\nHugo dwelt on the politics of the war and its sociology only in the most\nperfunctory manner. It was time the imperialistic ambitions of the\nCentral Powers were ended. A war was inevitable for that purpose.\nFrance and England had been attacked. They were defending themselves. He\nwould assist them. Even the problem of citizenship and the tangle of red\ntape his enlistment might involve did not impress him. He could see the\nfield of battle and hear the roar of guns, a picture conjured up by his\nknowledge of the old wars. What a soldier he would be!\n\nWhile his mind was still leaping and throbbing and his head was\nwhirling, darkness descended. He would give away his life, do his duty\nand a hundred times more than his duty. Here was the thing that was\nintended for him, the weapon forged for his hand, the task designed for\nhis undertaking. War. In war he could bring to a full fruition the\nmajesty of his strength. No need to fear it there, no need to be ashamed\nof it. He felt himself almost the Messiah of war, the man created at the\nprecise instant he was required. His call to serve was sounding in his\nears. And the bands played.\n\nThe chaos did not diminish at night, but, rather, it increased. He went\nwith milling crowds to a bulletin board. The Germans had commenced to\nmove. They had entered Belgium in violation of treaties long held\nsacred. Belgium was resisting and Li\u00e9ge was shaking at the devastation\nof the great howitzers. A terrible crime. Hugo shook with the rage of\nthe crowd. The first outrages and violations, highly magnified, were\nreported. The blond beast would have to be broken.\n\n\"God damn,\" a voice drawled at Hugo's side. He turned. A tall, lean man\nstood there, a man who was unquestionably American. Hugo spoke in\ninstant excitement.\n\n\"There sure is hell to pay.\"\n\nThe man turned his head and saw Hugo. He stared at him rather\nsuperciliously, at his slightly seedy clothes and his strong, unusual\nface. \"American?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Let's have a drink.\"\n\nThey separated themselves from the mob and went to a crowded caf\u00e9. The\nman sat down and Hugo took a chair at his side. \"As you put it,\" the man\nsaid, \"there is hell to pay. Let's drink on the payment.\"\n\nHugo felt in him a certain aloofness, a detachment that checked his\ndesire to throw himself into flamboyant conversation. \"My name's\nDanner,\" he said.\n\n\"Mine's Shayne, Thomas Mathew Shayne. I'm from New York.\"\n\n\"So am I, in a way. I was on a ship that was stranded here by the war.\nAt loose ends now.\"\n\nShayne nodded. He was not particularly friendly for a person who had met\na countryman in a strange city. Hugo did not realize that Shayne had\nbeen besieged all day by distant acquaintances and total strangers for\nassistance in leaving France, or that he expected a request for money\nfrom Hugo momentarily. And Shayne did not seem particularly wrought up\nby the condition of war. They lifted their glasses and drank. Hugo lost\na little of his ardour.\n\n\"Nice mess.\"\n\n\"Time, though. Time the Germans got their answer.\"\n\nShayne's haughty eyebrows lifted. His wide, thin mouth smiled. \"Perhaps.\nI just came from Germany. Seemed like a nice, peaceful country three\nweeks ago.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Hugo wondered if there were many pro-German Americans. His\ncompanion answered the thought.\n\n\"Not that I don't believe the Germans are wrong. But war is such--such a\ndamn fool thing.\"\n\n\"Well, it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"No, it can't. We're all going to go out and get killed, though.\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\"Sure. America will get in it. That's part of the game. America is more\ndangerous to Germany than France--or England, for that matter.\"\n\n\"That's a rather cold-blooded viewpoint.\"\n\nShayne nodded. \"I've been raised on it. _Gar\u00e7on, l'addition, s'il vous\npla\u00eet._\" He reached for his pocketbook simultaneously with Hugo. \"I'm\nsorry you're stranded,\" he said, \"and if a hundred francs will help,\nI'll be glad to let you have it. I can't do more.\"\n\nHugo's jaw dropped. He laughed a little. \"Good lord, man, I said my ship\nwas stuck. Not me. And these drinks are mine.\" He reached into his\npocket and withdrew a huge roll of American bills and a packet of\nFrench notes.\n\nShayne hesitated. His calmness was not severely shaken, however. \"I'm\nsorry, old man. You see, all day I've been fighting off starving and\nstartled Americans and I thought you were one. I apologize for my\nmistake.\" He looked at Hugo with more interest. \"As a matter of fact,\nI'm a little skittish about patriotism. And about war. Of course, I'm\ngoing to be in it. The first entertaining thing that has happened in a\ndog's age. But I'm a conscientious objector on principles. I rather\nthought I'd enlist in the Foreign Legion to-morrow.\"\n\nHe was an unfamiliar type to Hugo. He represented the American who had\nbeen educated at home and abroad, who had acquired a wide horizon for\nhis views, who was bored with the routine of his existence. His clothes\nwere elegant and impeccable. His face was very nearly inscrutable.\nAlthough he was only a few years older than Hugo, he made the latter\nfeel youthful.\n\nThey had a brace of drinks, two more and two more. All about them was\nbedlam, as if the emotions of man had suddenly been let loose to sweep\nhim off his feet. Grief, joy, rage, lust, fear were all obviously there\nin almost equal proportions.\n\nShayne extended his hand. \"They have something to fight for, at least.\nSomething besides money and glory. A grudge. I wonder what it is that\nmakes me want to get in? I do.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\nShayne shook his head. \"I wouldn't if I were you. Still, you will\nprobably be compelled to in a while.\" He looked at his watch. \"Do you\ncare to take dinner with me? I had an engagement with an aunt who is on\nthe verge of apoplexy because two of the Boston Shaynes are in Munich.\nIt scarcely seems appropriate at the moment. I detest her, anyway. What\ndo you say?\"\n\n\"I'd like to have dinner with you.\"\n\nThey walked down the Cannebi\u00e8re. At a restaurant on the east side near\nthe foot of the thoroughfare they found a table in the corner. A pair of\nwaiters hastened to take their order. The place was riotous with voices\nand the musical sounds of dining. On a special table was a great\ndemijohn of 1870 cognac, which was fast being drained by the guests.\nShayne consulted with his companion and then ordered in fluent French.\nThe meal that was brought approached a perfection of service and a\nsuperiority of cooking that Hugo had never experienced. And always the\nbabble, the blare of bands, the swelling and fading persistence of the\nstringed orchestra, the stream of purple Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape and its\nflinty taste, the glitter of the lights and the bright colours on the\nmosaics that represented the principal cities of Europe. It was a\nsplendid meal.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'll have to ask your name again,\" Shayne said.\n\n\"Danner. Hugo Danner.\"\n\n\"Good God! Not the football player?\"\n\n\"I did play football--some time ago.\"\n\n\"I saw you against Cornell--when was it?--two years ago. You were\nmagnificent. How does it happen that--\"\n\n\"That I'm here?\" Hugo looked directly into Shayne's eyes.\n\n\"Well--I have no intention of prying into your affairs.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you. Why not?\" Hugo drank his wine. \"I killed a man--in\nthe game--and quit. Beat it.\"\n\nShayne accepted the statement calmly. \"That's tough. I can understand\nyour desire to get out from under. Things like that are bad when you're\nyoung.\"\n\n\"What else could I have done?\"\n\n\"Nothing. What are you going to do? Rather, what were you going to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Hugo answered slowly. \"What do you do? What do people\ngenerally do?\" He felt the question was drunken, but Shayne accepted it\nat its face value.\n\n\"I'm one of those people who have too much money to be able to do\nanything I really care about, most of the time. The family keeps me in\nsight and control. But I'm going to cut away to-morrow.\"\n\n\"In the Foreign Legion? I'll go with you.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" They shook hands across the table.\n\nThree hours later found them at another caf\u00e9. They had been walking part\nof the time in the throngs on the street. For a while they had stood\noutside a newspaper office watching the bulletins. They were quite\ndrunk.\n\n\"Old man,\" Shayne said, \"I'm mighty glad I found you.\"\n\n\"Me, too, old egg. Where do we go next?\"\n\n\"I don't know. What's your favourite vice? We can locate it in\nMarseilles.\"\n\nHugo frowned. \"Well, vice is so limited in its scope.\"\n\nHis companion chuckled. \"Isn't it? I've always said vice was narrow. The\nnext time I see Aunt Emma I'm going to say: 'Emma, vice is becoming too\nnarrow in its scope.' She'll be furious and it will bring her to an\nearly demise and I'll inherit a lot more money, and that will be the\nreal tragedy. She's a useless old fool, Aunt Emma. Never did a valuable\nthing in her life. Goes in for charity--just like we go in for golf and\nwhat-not. Oh, well, to hell with Aunt Emma.\"\n\nHugo banged his glass on the table. \"_Gar\u00e7on! Encore deux whiskey \u00e0\nl'eau_ and to hell with Aunt Emma.\"\n\n\"Like to play roulette?\"\n\n\"Like to try.\"\n\nThey climbed into a taxi. Shayne gave an address and they were driven to\nanother quarter of the town. In a room packed with people in evening\nclothes they played for an hour. Several people spoke to Shayne and he\nintroduced Hugo to them. Shayne won and Hugo lost. They went out into\nthe night. The streets were quieter in that part of town. Two girls\naccosted them.\n\n\"That gives me an idea,\" Shayne said. \"Let's find a phone. Maybe we can\nget Marcelle and Claudine.\"\n\nMarcelle and Claudine met them at the door of the old house. Their arms\nwere laden with champagne bottles. The interior of the dwelling belied\nits cold, grey, ancient stones. Hugo did not remember much of what\nfollowed that evening. Short, unrelated fragments stuck in his\nmind--Shayne chasing the white form of Marcelle up and down the stairs;\nhimself in a huge bath-tub washing a back in front of him, his surprise\nwhen he saw daylight through the wooden shutters of the house.\n\nSomeone was shaking him. \"Come on, soldier. The leave's up.\"\n\nHe opened his eyes and collected his thoughts. He grinned at Shayne.\n\"All right. But if I had to defend myself right now--I'd fail against a\ngood strong mouse.\"\n\n\"We'll fix that. Hey! Marcelle! Got any Fernet-Branca?\"\n\nThe girl came with two large glasses of the pick-me-up. Hugo swallowed\nthe bitter brown fluid and shuddered. Claudine awoke. \"_Ch\u00e9ri!_\" she\nsighed, and kissed him.\n\nThey sat on the edge of the bed. \"Boy!\" Hugo said. \"What a binge!\"\n\n\"You like eet?\" Claudine murmured.\n\nHe took her hand. \"Loved it, darling. And now we're going to war.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, and, at the door: \"_Bonne chance!_\"\n\nShayne left Hugo, after agreeing on a time and place for their meeting\nin the afternoon. The hours passed slowly. Hugo took another drink, and\nthen, exerting his judgment and will, he refrained from taking more. At\nnoon he partook of a light meal. He thought, or imagined, that the\necstasy of the day before was showing some signs of decline. It occurred\nto him that the people might be very sober and quiet before the war was\na thing to be written into the history of France.\n\nThe sun was shining. He found a place in the shade where he could avoid\nit. He ordered a glass of beer, tasted it, and forgot to finish it. The\nelation of his first hours had passed. But the thing within him that had\ncaused it was by no means dead. As he sat there, his muscles tensed with\nthe picturization of what was soon to be. He saw the grim shadows of the\nenemy. He felt the hot splash of blood. For one suspended second he was\nashamed of himself, and then he stamped out that shame as being\nsomething very much akin to cowardice.\n\nHe wondered why Shayne was joining the Legion and what sort of person he\nwas underneath his rather haughty exterior. A man of character,\nevidently, and one who was weary of the world to which he had been\nprivileged. Hugo's reverie veered to his mother and father. He tried to\nimagine what they would think of his enlistment, of him in the war; and\neven what they thought of him from the scant and scattered information\nhe had supplied. He was sure that he would justify himself. He felt\npurged and free and noble. His strength was a thing of wreck and ruin,\ngiven to the world at a time when wreck and ruin were needed to set it\nright. It was odd that such a product should emerge from the dusty brain\nof a college professor in a Bible-ridden town.\n\nHugo had not possessed a religion for a long time. Now, wondering on\nanother tangent if the war might not bring about his end, he thought\nabout it. He realized that he would hate himself for murmuring a prayer\nor asking protection. He was gamer than the Cross-obsessed weaklings who\nwere not wise enough to look life in the face and not brave enough to\ndraw the true conclusions from what they saw. True conclusions? He\nmeditated. What did it matter--agnosticism, atheism, pantheism--anything\nbut the savage and anthropomorphic twaddle that had been doled out since\nthe Israelites singled out Jehovah from among their many gods. He would\nnot commit himself. He would go back with his death to the place where\nhe had been before he was born and feel no more regret than he had in\nthat oblivious past. Meanwhile he would fight! He moved restively and\nwaited for Shayne with growing impatience.\n\nUntil that chaotic and gorgeous hour he had lived for nothing, proved\nnothing, accomplished nothing. Society was no better in any way because\nhe had lived. He excepted the lives he had saved, the few favours he had\ndone. That was nothing in proportion to his powers. He was his own\nmeasure, and by his own efforts would he satisfy himself. War! He flexed\nhis arms. War. His black eyes burned with a formidable light.\n\nThen Shayne came. Walking with long strides. A ghostly smile on his\nlips. A darkness in his usually pale-blue eyes. Hugo liked him. They\nsaid a few words and walked toward the recruiting-tent. A _poilu_ in\nsteely blue looked at them and saw that they were good. He proffered\npapers. They signed. That night they marched for the first time. A week\nlater they were sweating and swearing over the French manual of arms.\nHugo had offered his services to the commanding officer at the camp and\nbeen summarily denied an audience or a chance to exhibit his abilities.\nWhen they reached the lines--that would be time enough. Well, he could\nwait until those lines were reached.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nJust as the eastern horizon became light with something more steady than\nthe flare of the guns, the command came. Hugo bit his lip till it bled\ndarkly. He would show them--now. They might command him to wait--he\ncould restrain himself no longer. The men had been standing there tense\nand calm, their needle-like bayonets pointing straight up. \"_En avant!_\"\n\nHis heart gave a tremendous surge. It made his hands falter as he\nreached for the ladder rung. \"Here we go, Hugo.\"\n\n\"Luck, Tom.\"\n\nHe saw Shayne go over. He followed slowly. He looked at no man's land.\nThey had come up in the night and he had never seen it. The scene of\nholocaust resembled nothing more than the municipal ash dump at Indian\nCreek. It startled him. The grey earth in irregular heaps, the litter of\nmetal and equipment. He realized that he was walking forward with the\nother men. The ground under his feet was mushy, like ashes. Then he saw\npart of a human body. It changed his thoughts.\n\nThe man on Hugo's right emitted a noise like a squeak and jumped up in\nthe air. He had been hit. Out of the corner of his eye Hugo saw him\nfall, get up quickly, and fall again very slowly. His foot kicked after\nhe lay down. The rumbling in the sky grew louder and blotted out all\nother sound.\n\nThey walked on and on. It was like some eternal journey through the dun,\nvacant realms of Hades. Not much light, one single sound, and ghostly\ncompanions who faced always forward. The air in front of him was\nsuddenly dyed orange and he felt the concussion of a shell. His ears\nrang. He was still walking. He walked what he thought was a number of\nmiles.\n\nHis great strength seemed to have left him, and in its place was a\ncomplete enervation. With a deliberate effort he tested himself, kicking\nhis foot into the earth. It sank out of sight. He squared his shoulders.\nA man came near him, yelling something. It was Shayne. Hugo shook his\nhead. Then he heard the voice, a feeble shrill note. \"Soon be there.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Over that hill.\"\n\nShayne turned away and became part of the ghost escort of Hugo and his\npeculiarly lucid thoughts. He believed that he was more conscious of\nhimself and things then than ever before in his life. But he did not\nnotice one-tenth of the expression and action about himself. The top of\nthe rise was near. He saw an officer silhouetted against it for an\ninstant. The officer moved down the other side. He could see over the\nrise, then.\n\nAcross the grey ashes was a long hole. In front of it a maze of wire. In\nit--mushrooms. German helmets. Hugo gaped at them. All that training,\nall that restraint, had been expended for this. They were small and\nwithout meaning. He felt a sharp sting above his collar bone. He looked\nthere. A row of little holes had appeared in his shirt.\n\n\"Good God,\" he whispered, \"a machine gun.\"\n\nBut there was no blood. He sat down. He presumed, as a casualty, he was\njustified in sitting down. He opened his shirt by ripping it down. On\nhis dark-tanned skin there were four red marks. The bullets had not\npenetrated him. Too tough! He stared numbly at the walking men. They had\npassed him. The magnitude of his realization held him fixed for a full\nminute. He was invulnerable! He should have known it--otherwise he would\nhave torn himself apart by his own strength. Suddenly he roared and\nleaped to his feet. He snatched his rifle, cracking the stock in his\nfervour. He vaulted toward the helmets in the trench.\n\nHe dropped from the parapet and was confronted by a long knife on a gun.\nHis lips parted, his eyes shut to slits, he drew back his own weapon.\nThere was an instant's pause as they faced each other--two men, both\nknowing that in a few seconds one would be dead. Then Hugo, out of his\nscarlet fury, had one glimpse of his antagonist's face and person. The\nglimpse was but a flash. It was finished in quick motions. He was a\nlittle man--a foot shorter than Hugo. His eyes looked out from under his\nhelmet with a sort of pathetic earnestness. And he was worried, horribly\nworried, standing there with his rifle lifted and trying to remember the\nprecise technique of what would follow even while he fought back the\nrealization that it was hopeless. In that split second Hugo felt a\nhuman, amazing urge to tell him that it was all right, and that he ought\nto hold his bayonet a little higher and come forward a bit faster. The\nimage faded back to an enemy. Hugo acted mechanically from the rituals\nof drill. His own knife flashed. He saw the man's clothes part smoothly\nfrom his bowels, where the point had been inserted, up to the gray-green\ncollar. The seam reddened, gushed blood, and a length of intestine\nslipped out of it. The man's eyes looked at Hugo. He shook his head\ntwice. The look became far-away. He fell forward.\n\nHugo stepped over him. He was trembling and nauseated. A more formidable\nman approached warily. The bellow of battle returned to Hugo's ears. He\npushed back the threatening rifle easily and caught the neck in one\nhand, crushing it to a wet, sticky handful. So he walked through the\ntrench, a machine that killed quickly and remorselessly--a black warrior\nfrom a distant realm of the universe where the gods had bred another\nkind of man.\n\nHe came upon Shayne and found him engaged. Hugo stuck his opponent in\nthe back. No thought of fair play, no object but to kill--it did not\nmatter how. Dead Legionnaires and dead Germans mingled blood underfoot.\nThe trench was like the floor of an _abattoir_. Someone gave him a\ndrink. The men who remained went on across the ash dump to a second\ntrench.\n\nIt was night. The men, almost too tired to see or move, were trying to\nbarricade themselves against the ceaseless shell fire of the enemy. They\nfilled bags with gory mud and lifted them on the crumbling walls. At\ndawn the Germans would return to do what they had done. The darkness\nreverberated and quivered. Hugo worked like a Trojan. His efforts had\nmade a wide and deep hole in which machine guns were being placed.\nShayne fell at his feet. Hugo lifted him up. The captain nodded. \"Give\nhim a drink.\"\n\nSomeone brought liquor, and Hugo poured it between Shayne's teeth.\n\"Huh!\" Shayne said.\n\n\"Come on, boy.\"\n\n\"How did you like it, Danner?\"\n\nHugo did not answer. Shayne went on, \"I didn't either--much. This is no\ngentleman's war. Jesus! I saw a thing or two this morning. A guy walking\nwith all his--\"\n\n\"Never mind. Take another drink.\"\n\n\"Got anything to eat?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, we can fight on empty bellies. The Germans will empty them\nfor us anyhow.\"\n\n\"The hell they will.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty nearly all in.\"\n\n\"So's everyone.\"\n\nThey put Hugo on watch because he still seemed fresh. Those men who were\nnot compelled to stay awake fell into the dirt and slept immediately.\nToward dawn Hugo heard sounds in no man's land. He leaped over the\nparapet. In three jumps he found himself among the enemy. They were\ncreeping forward. Hugo leaped back. \"_Ils viennent!_\"\n\nMen who slept like death were kicked conscious. They rose and fired into\nthe night. The surprise of the attack was destroyed. The enemy came on,\nengaging in the darkness with the exhausted Legionnaires. Twice Hugo\nwent among them when inundation threatened and, using his rifle barrel\nas a club, laid waste on every hand. He walked through them striking and\nshattering. And twice he saved his salient from extermination. Day came\nsullenly. It began to rain. The men stood silently among their dead.\n\nHugo lit a cigarette. His eyes moved up and down the shambles. At\nintervals of two yards a man, his helmet trickling rain, his clothes\nfilthy, his face inscrutable. Shayne was there on sagging knees. Hugo\ncould not understand why he had not been killed.\n\nHugo was learning about war. He thought then that the task which he had\nset for himself was not altogether to his liking. There should be other\nand more important things for him to do. He did not like to slaughter\nindividuals. The day passed like a cycle in hell. No change in the\npersonnel except that made by an occasional death. No food. No water.\nThey seemed to be exiled by their countrymen in a pool of fire and\nfamine and destruction. At dusk Hugo spoke to the captain.\n\n\"We cannot last another night without water, food,\" he said.\n\n\"We shall die here, then.\"\n\n\"I should like, sir, to volunteer to go back and bring food.\"\n\n\"We need ammunition more.\"\n\n\"Ammunition, then.\"\n\n\"One man could not bring enough to assist--much.\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"You are valuable here. With your club and your charmed life, you have\nalready saved this remnant of good soldiers.\"\n\n\"I will return in less than an hour.\"\n\n\"Good luck, then.\"\n\nWhere there had been a man, there was nothing. The captain blinked his\neyes and stared at the place. He swore softly in French and plunged into\nhis dug-out at the sound of ripping in the sky.\n\nA half hour passed. The steady, nerve-racking bombardment continued at\nan unvaried pace. Then there was a heavy thud like that of a shell\nlanding and not exploding. The captain looked. A great bundle, tied\ntogether by ropes, had descended into the trench. A man emerged from\nbeneath it. The captain passed his hand over his eyes. Here was\nammunition for the rifles and the machine guns in plenty. Here was food.\nHere were four huge tins of water, one of them leaking where a shell\nfragment had pierced it. Here was a crate of canned meat and a sack of\nonions and a stack of bread loaves. Hugo broke the ropes. His chest rose\nand fell rapidly. He was sweating. The bundle he had carried weighed\nmore than a ton--and he had been running very swiftly.\n\nThe captain looked again. A case of cognac. Hugo was carrying things\ninto the dug-out. \"Where?\" the captain asked.\n\nHugo smiled and named a town thirty kilometres behind the lines. A town\nwhere citizens and soldiers together were even then in frenzied\ndiscussion over the giant who had fallen upon their stores and supplies\nand taken them, running off like a locomotive, in a hail of bullets that\ndid no harm to him.\n\n\"And how?\" the captain asked.\n\n\"I am strong.\"\n\nThe captain shrugged and turned his head away. His men were eating the\nfood, and drinking water mixed with brandy, and stuffing their pouches\nwith ammunition. The machine gunners were laughing. They would not be\nforced to spare the precious belts when the Germans came in the\nmorning. Hugo sat among them, dining his tremendous appetite.\n\nThree days went by. Every day, twice, five times, they were attacked.\nBut no offence seemed capable of driving that demoniac cluster of men\nfrom their position. A demon, so the enemy whispered, came out and\nfought for them. On the third day the enemy retreated along four\nkilometres of front, and the French moved up to reclaim many, many acres\nof their beloved soil. The Legionnaires were relieved and another\nepisode was added to their valiant history.\n\nHugo slept for twenty hours in the wooden barracks. After that he was\nwakened by the captain's orderly and summoned to his quarters. The\ncaptain smiled when he saluted. \"My friend,\" he said, \"I wish to thank\nyou in behalf of my country for your labour. I have recommended you for\nthe Croix de Guerre.\"\n\nHugo took his outstretched hand. \"I am pleased that I have helped.\"\n\n\"And now,\" the captain continued, \"you will tell me how you executed\nthat so unusual coup.\"\n\nHugo hesitated. It was the opportunity he had sought, the chance that\nmight lead to a special commission whereby he could wreak the vengeance\nof his muscles on the enemy. But he was careful, because he did not feel\nsecure in trusting the captain with too much of his secret. Even in a\nwar it was too terrible. They would mistrust him, or they would attempt\nto send him to their biologists. And he wanted to accomplish his mission\nunder their permission and with their co-operation. It would be more\nvaluable then and of greater magnitude. So he smiled and said: \"Have you\never heard of Colorado?\"\n\n\"No, I have not heard. It is a place?\"\n\n\"A place in America. A place that has scarcely been explored. I was born\nthere. And all the men of Colorado are born as I was born and are like\nme. We are very strong. We are great fighters. We cannot be wounded\nexcept by the largest shells. I took that package by force and I carried\nit to you on my back, running swiftly.\"\n\nThe captain appeared politely interested. He thumbed a dispatch. He\nstared at Hugo. \"If that is the truth, you shall show me.\"\n\n\"It is the truth--and I shall show you.\"\n\nHugo looked around. Finally he walked over to the sentry at the flap of\nthe tent and took his rifle. The man squealed in protest. Hugo lifted\nhim off the floor by the collar, shook him, and set him down.\n\nThe man shouted in dismay and then was silent at a word from the\ncaptain. Hugo weighed the gun in his hands while they watched and then\nslowly bent the barrel double. Next he tore it from its stock. Then he\ngrasped the parallel steel ends and broke them apart with a swift\nwrench. The captain half rose, his eyes bulged, he knocked over his\nink-well. His hand tugged at his moustache and waved spasmodically.\n\n\"You see?\" Hugo said.\n\nThe captain went to staff meeting that afternoon very thoughtful. He\nunderstood the difficulty of exhibiting his soldier's prowess under\ncircumstances that would assure the proper commission. He even\nconsidered remaining silent about Hugo. With such a man in his company\nit would soon be illustrious along the whole broad front. But the chance\ncame. When the meeting was finished and the officers relaxed over their\nwine, a colonel brought up the subject of the merits of various breeds\nof men as soldiers.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that the Prussians are undoubtedly our most\ndangerous foe. On our own side we have--\"\n\n\"Begging the colonel's pardon,\" the captain said, \"there is a species of\nfighter unknown, or almost unknown, in this part of the world, who\nexcels by far all others.\"\n\n\"And who may they be?\" the colonel asked stiffly.\n\n\"Have you ever heard of the Colorados?\"\n\n\"No,\" the colonel said.\n\nAnother officer meditated. \"They are redskins, American Indians, are\nthey not?\"\n\nThe captain shrugged. \"I do not know. I know only that they are superior\nto all other soldiers.\"\n\n\"And in what way?\"\n\nThe captain's eyes flickered. \"I have one Colorado in my troops. I will\ntell you what he did in five days near the town of Barsine.\" The\nofficers listened. When the captain finished, the colonel patted his\nshoulder. \"That is a very amusing fabrication. Very. With a thousand\nsuch men, the war would be ended in a week. Captain Crouan, I fear you\nhave been overgenerous in pouring the wine.\"\n\nThe captain rose, saluted. \"With your permission, I shall cause my\nColorado to be brought and you shall see.\"\n\nThe other men laughed. \"Bring him, by all means.\"\n\nThe captain dispatched an orderly. A few minutes later, Hugo was\nannounced at headquarters. The captain introduced him. \"Here, messieurs,\nis a Colorado. What will you have him do?\"\n\nThe colonel, who had expected the soldier to be both embarrassed and\nmade ridiculous, was impressed by Hugo's calm demeanour. \"You are\nstrong?\" he said with a faint irony.\n\n\"Exceedingly.\"\n\n\"He is not humble, at least, gentlemen.\" Laughter. The colonel fixed\nHugo with his eye. \"Then, my good fellow, if you are so strong, if you\ncan run so swiftly and carry such burdens, bring us one of our beautiful\nseventy-fives from the artillery.\"\n\n\"With your written order, if you please.\"\n\nThe colonel started, wrote the order laughingly, and gave it to Hugo. He\nleft the room.\n\n\"It is a good joke,\" the colonel said. \"But I fear it is harsh on the\nprivate.\"\n\nThe captain shrugged. Wine was poured. In a few minutes they heard heavy\nfootsteps outside the tent. \"He is here!\" the captain cried. The\nofficers rushed forward. Hugo stood outside the tent with the cannon\nthey had requested lifted over his head in one hand. With that same hand\nclasped on the breach, he set it down. The colonel paled and gulped.\n\"Name of the mother of God! He has brought it.\"\n\nHugo nodded. \"It was as nothing, my colonel. Now I will show you what we\nmen from Colorado can do. Watch.\"\n\nThey eyed him. There was a grating sound beneath his feet. Those who\nwere quickest of vision saw his body catapult through the air high over\ntheir heads. It landed, bounced prodigiously, vanished.\n\nCaptain Crouan coughed and swallowed. He faced his superiors, trying to\nseem nonchalant. \"That, gentlemen, is the sort of thing the Colorados\ndo--for sport.\"\n\nThe colonel recovered first. \"It is not human. Gentlemen, we have been\nin the presence of the devil himself.\"\n\n\"Or the Good Lord.\"\n\nThe captain shook his head. \"He is a man, I tell you. In Colorado all\nthe men are like that. He told me so himself. When he first enlisted, he\ncame to me and asked for a special commission to go to Berlin and smash\nthe Reich--to bring back the Kaiser himself. I thought he was mad. I\nmade him peel potatoes. He did not say any more foolish things. He was a\ngood soldier. Then the battle came and I saw him, not believing I saw\nhim, standing on the parapet and wielding his rifle like the lightning,\nkilling I do not know how many men. Hundreds certainly, perhaps\nthousands. Ah, it is as I said, the Colorados are the finest soldiers on\nearth. They are more than men.\"\n\n\"He comes!\"\n\nHugo burst from the sky, moving like a hawk. He came from the direction\nof the lines, many miles away. There was a bundle slung across his\nshoulder. There were holes in his uniform. He landed heavily among the\nofficers and set down his burden. It was a German. He dropped to the\nground.\n\n\"Water for him,\" Hugo panted. \"He has fainted. I snatched him from his\noutpost in a trench.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nAt Blaisencourt it was spring again. The war was nearly a year old.\nBlaisencourt was now a street of houses' ghosts, of rubble and dirt,\npopulated by soldiers. A little new grass sprouted peevishly here and\nthere; an occasional house retained enough of its original shape to\nharbour an industry. Captain Crouan, his arm in a sling, was looking\nover a heap of d\u00e9bris with the aid of field glasses.\n\n\"I see him,\" he said, pointing to a place on the boiling field where an\napparent lump of soil had detached itself.\n\n\"He rises! He goes on! He takes one of his mighty leaps! Ah, God, if I\nonly had a company of such men!\"\n\nHis aide, squatted near by, muttered something under his breath. The\ncaptain spoke again. \"He is very near their infernal little gun now. He\nhas taken his rope. Ahaaaa! He spins it in the air. It falls. They are\nastonished. They rise up in the trench. Quick, Ph\u00e8dre! Give me a rifle.\"\nThe rifle barked sharply four, five times. Its bullet found a mark.\nThen another. \"Ahaaa! Two of them! And M. Danner now has his rope on\nthat pig's breath. It comes up. See! He has taken it under his arm! They\nare shooting their machine guns. He drops into a shell hole. He has been\nhit, but he is laughing at them. He leaps. Look out, Ph\u00e8dre!\"\n\nHugo landed behind the d\u00e9bris with a small German trench mortar in his\narms. He set it on the floor. The captain opened his mouth, and Hugo\nwaved to him to be silent. Deliberately, Hugo looked over the rickety\nparapet of loose stones. He elevated the muzzle of the gun and drew back\nthe lanyard. The captain, grinning, watched through his glasses. The gun\nroared.\n\nIts shell exploded presently on the brow of the enemy trench, tossing up\na column of smoke and earth. \"I should have brought some ammunition with\nme,\" Hugo said.\n\nCaptain Crouan stared at the little gun. \"Pig,\" he said. \"Son of a pig!\nFive of my men are in your little belly! Bah!\" He kicked it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSummer in Aix-au-Dixvaches. A tall Englishman addressing Captain Crouan.\nHis voice was irritated by the heat. \"Is it true that you French have an\nIndian scout here who can bash in those Minenwerfers?\"\n\n\"_Pardon, mon colonel, mais je ne comprends pas l'anglais._\"\n\nHe began again in bad French. Captain Crouan smiled. \"Ah? You are\ntroubled there on your sector? You wish to borrow our astonishing\nsoldier? It will be a pleasure, I assure you.\"\n\nHot calm night. The sky pin-pricked with stars, the air redolent with\nthe mushy flavour of dead meat. So strong it left a taste in the mouth.\nSo strong that food and water tasted like faintly chlorinated\nputrescence. Hugo, his blue uniform darker with perspiration, tramped\nthrough the blackness to a dug-out. Fifteen minutes in candlelight with\na man who spoke English in an odd manner.\n\n\"They've been raisin' bloody hell with us from a point about there.\" The\ntap of a pencil. \"We've got little enough confidence in you, God\nknows--\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't be huffy. We're obliged to your captain for the loan of you. But\nwe've lost too many trying to take the place ourselves not to be fed up\nwith it. I suppose you'll want a raiding party?\"\n\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\n\"But, cripes, you can't make it there alone.\"\n\n\"I can do it.\" Hugo smiled. \"And you've lost so many of your own men--\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOtto Meyer pushed his helmet back on his sandy-haired head and gasped in\nthe feverish air. A non-commissioned officer passing behind him shoved\nthe helmet over his eyes with a muttered word of caution. Otto\nshrugged. Half a dozen men lounged near by. Beside and above them were\nthe muzzles of four squat guns and the irregular silhouette of a heap of\nammunition. Two of the men rolled onto their backs and panted. \"I wish,\"\none said in a soft voice, \"that I was back in the Hofbrau at Munich with\na tall stein of beer, with that fat _Fr\u00e4ulein_ that kissed me in the\nPotsdam station last September sitting at my side and the orchestra\nplaying--\"\n\nOtto flung a clod of dank earth at the speaker. There were chuckles from\nthe shadows that sucked in and exhaled the rancid air. Outside the pit\nin which they lay, there was a gentle thud.\n\nOtto scrambled into a sitting posture. \"What is that?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Even these damned English aren't low enough to fight us in\nthis weather.\"\n\n\"You can never tell. At night, in the first battle of--listen!\"\n\nThe thud was repeated, much closer. It was an ominous sound, like the\ndrop of a sack of earth from a great height. Otto picked up a gun. He\nwas a man who perspired freely, and now, in that single minute, his face\ntrickled. He pointed the gun into the air and pulled the trigger. It\nkicked back and jarred his arm. In the glaring light that followed, six\nmen peered through the spider-web of the wire. They saw nothing.\n\n\"You see?\"\n\nTheir eyes smarted with the light and dark, so swiftly exchanged. Came\na thud in their midst. A great thud that spattered the dirt in all\ndirections. \"Something has fallen.\" \"A shell!\" \"It's a dud!\"\n\nThe men rose and tried to run. Otto had regained his vision and saw the\nobject that had descended. A package of yellow sticks tied to a great\nmass of iron--wired to it. Instead of running, he grasped it. His\nstrength was not enough to lift it. Then, for one short eternity, he saw\na sizzling spark move toward the sticks. He clutched at it. \"Help! The\nguns must be saved. A bomb!\" He knew his arms surrounded death. \"I\ncannot--\"\n\nHis feeble voice was blown to the four winds at that instant. A terrible\nexplosion burst from him, shattering the escaping men, blasting the\nhowitzers into fragments, enlarging the pit to enormous dimensions. Both\nfronts clattered with machine-gun fire. Flares lit the terrain. Hugo,\nrunning as if with seven-league boots, was thrown on his face by the\nconcussion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinter. Mud. A light fall of snow that was split into festers by the\nguns before it could anneal the ancient sores. Hugo shivered and stared\ninto no man's land, whence a groan had issued for twenty hours, audible\noccasionally over the tumult of the artillery. He saw German eyes turned\nmutely on the same heap of rags that moved pitifully over the snow,\nleaving a red wake, dragging a bloody thing behind. It rose and fell,\nmoving parallel to the two trenches. Many machine-gun bullets had\neither missed it or increased its crimson torment. Hugo went out and\nkilled the heap of rags, with a revolver that cracked until the groans\nstopped in a low moan. Breaths on both sides were bated. The rags had\nbeen gray-green. A shout of low, rumbling praise came from the silent\nenemy trenches. Hugo looked over there for a moment and smiled. He\nlooked down at the thing and vomited. The guns began again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother winter. Time had become stagnant. All about it was a pool of mud\nand suppuration, and shot through it was the sound of guns and the scent\nof women, the taste of wine and the touch of cold flesh. Somewhere, he\ncould not remember distinctly where, Hugo had a clean uniform, a\nportfolio of papers, a jewel-case of medals. He was a great man--a man\nfeared. The Colorado in the Foreign Legion. Men would talk about what\nthey had seen him accomplish all through the next fifty years--at\nwatering places in the Sahara, at the crackling fires of country-house\nparties in Shropshire, on the shores of the South Seas, on the moon,\nmaybe. Old men, at the last, would clear the phlegm from their skinny\nthroats and begin: \"When I was a-fightin' with the Legion in my youngest\ndays, there was a fellow in our company that came from some place in\nwild America that I disrecollect.\" And younger, more sanguine men would\nlisten and shake their heads and wish that there was a war for them to\nfight.\n\nHugo was not satisfied with that. Still, he could see no decent exit and\ncontrive no better use for himself. He clung frantically to the ideals\nhe had taken with him and to the splendid purpose with which he had\nemblazoned his mad lust to enlist. Marseilles and the sentiment it had\ninspired seemed very far away. He thought about it as he walked toward\nthe front, his head bent into the gale and his helmet pitched to protect\nhis eyes from the sting of the rain.\n\nThat night he slept with Shayne, a lieutenant now, twice wounded, thrice\ndecorated, and, like Hugo, thinner than he had been, older, with eyes\ngrown bleak, and seldom vehement. He resembled his lean Yankee ancestors\nafter their exhausting campaigns of the wilderness, alive and sentient\nonly through a sheer stubbornness that brooked neither element nor\ndisaster. Only at rare moments did the slight strain of his French blood\nlift him from that grim posture. Such a moment was afforded by the\narrival of Hugo.\n\n\"Great God, Hugo! We haven't seen you in a dog's age.\" Other soldiers\nsmiled and brought rusty cigarettes into the dug-out where they sat and\nsmoked.\n\nHugo held out his hand. \"Been busy. Glad to see you.\"\n\n\"Yes. I know how busy you've been. Up and down the lines we hear about\nyou. _Le Colorado._ Damn funny war. You'd think you weren't human, or\nanywhere near human, to hear these birds. Wish you'd tell me how you get\naway with it. Hasn't one nicked you yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"God damn. Got me here\"--he tapped his shoulder--\"and here\"--his thigh.\n\n\"That's tough. I guess the sort of work I do isn't calculated to be as\nrisky as yours,\" Hugo said.\n\n\"Huh! That you can tell to Sweeny.\" The Frenchmen were still sitting\npolitely, listening to a dialogue they could not understand. Hugo and\nShayne eyed each other in silence. A long, penetrating silence. At\nlength the latter said soberly: \"Still as enthusiastic as you were that\nnight in Marseilles?\"\n\n\"Are you?\"\n\n\"I didn't have much conception of what war would be then.\"\n\n\"Neither did I,\" Hugo responded. \"And I'm not very enthusiastic any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Oh, well--\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Heard from your family?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\nThey relapsed into silence again. By and by they ate a meal of cold\nfood, supplemented by rank, steaming coffee. Then they slept. Before\ndawn Hugo woke feeling like a man in the mouth of a volcano that had\ncommenced to erupt. The universe was shaking. The walls of the dug-out\nwere molting chunks of earth. The scream and burst of shells were\nconstant. He heard Shayne's voice above the din, issuing orders in\nFrench. Their batteries were to be phoned. A protective counter-fire. A\n_barrage_ in readiness in case of attack, which seemed imminent. Larger\nshells drowned the voice. Hugo rose and stood beside Shayne.\n\n\"Coming over?\"\n\n\"Coming over.\"\n\nA shapeless face spoke in the gloom. The voice panted. \"We must get out\nof here, my lieutenant. They are smashing in the dug-out.\" A methodical\nscramble to the orifice. Hell was rampaging in the trench. The shells\nfell everywhere. Shayne shook his head. It was neither light nor dark.\nThe incessant blinding fire did not make things visible except for\nfragments of time and in fantastic perspectives. Things belched and\nboomed and smashed the earth and whistled and howled. It was impossible\nto see how life could exist in that caldron, and yet men stood calmly\nall along the line. A few of them, here and there, were obliterated.\n\nThe red sky in the southeast became redder with the rising sun. Hugo\nremained close to the wall. It was no novelty for him to be under shell\nfire. But at such times he felt the need of a caution with which he\ncould ordinarily dispense. If one of the steel cylinders found him, even\nhis mighty frame might not contain itself. Even he might be rent\nasunder. Shayne saw him and smiled. Twenty yards away a geyser of fire\nsprayed the heavens. Ten feet away a fragment of shell lashed down a\npile of sand-bags. Shayne's smile widened. Hugo returned it.\n\nThen red fury enveloped the two men. Hugo was crushed ferociously\nagainst the wall and liberated in the same second. He fell forward, his\nears singing and his head dizzy. He lay there, aching. Dark red stains\nflowed over his face from his nose and ears. Painfully he stood up. A\nsoldier was watching him from a distance with alarmed eyes. Hugo\nstepped. He found that locomotion was possible. The bedlam increased. It\nbrought a sort of madness. He remembered Shayne. He searched in the\nsmoking, stinking muck. He found the shoulders and part of Shayne's\nhead. He picked them up in his hands, disregarding the butchered ends of\nthe raw gobbet. White electricity crackled in his head.\n\nHe leaped to the parapet, shaking his fists. \"God damn you dirty sons of\nbitches. I'll make you pay for this. You got him, got him, you bastards!\nI'll shove your filthy hides down the devil's throat and through his\nguts. Oh, Jesus!\" He did not feel the frantic tugging of his fellows. He\nran into that bubbling, doom-ridden chaos, waving his arms and shouting\nmaniacal profanities. A dozen times he was knocked down. He bled slowly\nwhere fragments had battered him. He crossed over and paused on the\nGerman parapet. He was like a being of steel. Bullets sprayed him. His\narms dangled and lifted. Barbed wire trailed behind him.\n\nDown before him, shoulder to shoulder, the attacking regiments waited\nfor the last crescendo of the bombardment. They saw him come out of the\nfury and smiled grimly. They knew such madness. They shot. He came on.\nAt last they could hear his voice dimly through the tumult. Someone\nshouted that he was mad--to beware when he fell. Hugo jumped among them.\nBayonets rose. Hugo wrenched three knives from their wielders in one\nwild clutch. His hands went out, snatching and squeezing. That was all.\nNo weapons, no defence. Just--hands. Whatever they caught they crushed\nflat, and heads fell into those dreadful fingers, sides, legs, arms,\nbellies. Bayonets slid from his tawny skin, taking his clothes. By and\nby, except for his shoes, he was naked. His fingers had made a hundred\nbunches of clotted pulp and then a thousand as he walked swiftly forward\nin that trench. Ahead of him was a file of green; behind, a clogged row\nof writhing men. Scarcely did the occupants of each new traverse see him\nbefore they were smitten. The wounds he inflicted were monstrous. On he\nwalked, his voice now stilled, his breath sucking and whistling through\nhis teeth, his hands flailing and pinching and spurting red with every\ncontact. No more formidable engine of desolation had been seen by man,\nno more titanic fury, no swifter and surer death. For thirty minutes he\nraged through that line. The men thinned. He had crossed the attacking\nfront.\n\nThen the barrage lifted. But no whistles blew. No soldiers rose. A few\nraised their heads and then lay down again. Hugo stopped and went back\ninto the _abattoir_. He leaped to the parapet. The French saw him,\nsilhouetted against the sky. The second German wave, coming slowly over\na far hill, saw him and hesitated. No ragged line of advancing men. No\ncacophony of rifle fire. Only that strange, savage figure. A man dipped\nin scarlet, nude, dripping, panting. Slowly in that hiatus he wheeled.\nHis lungs thundered to the French. \"Come on, you black bastards. I've\nkilled them all. Come on. We'll send them down to hell.\"\n\nThe officers looked and understood that something phenomenal had\nhappened. No Germans were coming. A man stood above their trench. \"Come,\nquick!\" Hugo shouted. He saw that they did not understand. He stood an\ninstant, fell into the trench; and presently a shower of German corpses\nflung through the air in wide arcs and landed on the very edge of the\nFrench position. Then they came, and Hugo, seeing them, went on alone to\nmeet the second line. He might have forged on through that bloody swathe\nto the heart of the Empire if his vitality had been endless. But, some\ntime in the battle, he fell unconscious on the field, and his\nforward-leaning comrades, pushing back the startled enemy, found him\nlying there.\n\nThey made a little knot around him, silent, quivering. \"It is the\nColorado,\" someone said. \"His friend, Shayne--it is he who was the\nlieutenant just killed.\"\n\nThey shook their heads and felt a strange fear of the unconscious man.\n\"He is breathing.\" They called for stretcher-bearers. They faced the\nenemy again, bent over on the stocks of their rifles, surged forward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHugo was washed and dressed in pyjamas. His wounds had healed without\nthe necessity of a single stitch. He was grateful for that. Otherwise\nthe surgeons might have had a surprise which would have been difficult\nto allay. He sat in a wheel chair, staring across a lawn. An angular\nwoman in an angular hat and tailored clothes was trying to engage him in\nconversation.\n\n\"Is it very painful, my man?\"\n\nHugo was seeing that trench again--the pulp and blood and hate of it.\n\"Not very.\"\n\nHer tongue and saliva made a noise. \"Don't tell me. I know it was. I\nknow how you all bleed and suffer.\"\n\n\"Madam, it happens that my wounds were quite superficial.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my boy. They wouldn't have brought you to a base hospital in\nthat case. You can't fool me.\"\n\n\"I was suffering only from exhaustion.\"\n\nShe paused. He saw a gleam in her eye. \"I suppose you don't like to\ntalk--about things. Poor boy! But I imagine your life has been so full\nof horror that it would be good for you to unburden yourself. Now tell\nme, just what does it feel like to bayonet a man?\"\n\nHugo trembled. He controlled his voice. \"Madam,\" he replied, \"it feels\nexactly like sticking your finger into a warm, steaming pile of\ncow-dung.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she gasped. And he heard her repeat it again in the corridor.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\n     \"Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Jordan Shayne,\" Hugo wrote. Then he paused in\n     thought. He began again. \"I met your son in Marseilles and was with\n     him most of the time until his death.\" He hesitated. \"In fact, he\n     died in my arms from the effect of the same shell which sent me to\n     this hospital. He is buried in Carcy cemetery, on the south side.\n     It is for that reason I take the liberty to address you.\n\n     \"I thought that you would like to know some of the things that he\n     did not write to you. Your son enlisted because he felt the war\n     involved certain ideals that were worthy of preservation. That he\n     gave his life for those ideals must be a source of pride to you. In\n     training he was always controlled, kindly, unquarrelsome,\n     comprehending. In battle he was aggressive, brilliant, and more\n     courageous than any other man I have ever known.\n\n     \"In October, a year ago, he was decorated for bringing in Captain\n     Crouan, who was severely wounded during an attack that was\n     repulsed. Under heavy shell fire Tom went boldly into no man's\n     land and carried the officer from a shell pit on his back. At the\n     time Tom himself sustained three wounds. He was mentioned a number\n     of times in the dispatches for his leadership of attacks and\n     patrols. He was decorated a second time for the capture of a German\n     field officer and three of his staff, a coup which your son\n     executed almost single-handed.\n\n     \"Following his death his company made an attack to avenge him,\n     which wiped out the entire enemy position along a sector nearly a\n     kilometre in width and which brought a permanent advantage to the\n     Allied lines. That is mute testimony of his popularity among the\n     officers and men. I know of no man more worthy of the name\n     'American,' no American more worthy of the words 'gentleman' and\n     'hero.'\n\n     \"I realize the slight comfort of these things, and yet I feel bound\n     to tell you of them, because Tom was my friend, and his death is\n     grievous to me as well as to you.\n\n     \"Yours sincerely,\n\n     \"(LIEUTENANT) HUGO DANNER\"\n\nHugo posted the letter. When the answer came, he was once again in\naction, the guns chugging and rumbling, the earth shaking. The reply\nread:\n\n     \"DEAR LIEUTENANT DANNER:\n\n     \"Thank you for your letter in reference to our son. We knew that he\n     had enlisted in some foreign service. We did not know of his\n     death. I am having your statements checked, because, if they are\n     true, I shall be one of the happiest persons alive, and his mother\n     will be both happy and sad. The side of young Tom which you claim\n     to have seen is one quite unfamiliar to us. At home he was always a\n     waster, much of a snob, and impossible to control. It may be harsh\n     to say such things of him now that he is dead, but I cannot recall\n     one noble deed, one unselfish act, in his life here with us.\n\n     \"That I have a dead son would not sadden me. Tom had been\n     disinherited by us, his mother and father. But that my dead son was\n     a hero makes me feel that at last, coming into the Shayne blood and\n     heritage, he has atoned. And so I honour him. If the records show\n     that all you said of him is true, I shall not only honour him in\n     this country, but I shall come to France to pay my tribute with a\n     full heart and a knowledge that neither he nor I lived in vain.\n\n     \"Gratefully yours,\n\n     \"R. J. SHAYNE\"\n\nHugo reread the letter and stood awhile with wistful eyes. He remembered\nShayne's Aunt Emma, Shayne's bitter calumniation of his family. Well,\nthey had not understood him and he had not wanted them to understand\nhim. Perhaps Shayne had been more content than he admitted in the mud of\nthe trenches. The war had been a real thing to him. Hugo thought of its\ninsufficiencies for himself. The world was not enough for Shayne, but\nthe war had been. Both were insufficient for Hugo Danner. He listened to\nthe thunder in the sky tiredly.\n\nTwo months later Hugo was ordered from rest billets to the major's\nquarters. A middle-aged man and woman accompanied by a sleek Frenchman\nawaited him. The man stepped forward with dignified courtesy. \"I am Tom\nShayne's father. This is Mrs. Shayne.\"\n\nHugo felt a great lack of interest in them. They had come too late. It\nwas their son who had been his friend. He almost regretted the letter.\nHe shook hands with them. Mrs. Shayne went to an automobile. Her husband\ninvited Hugo to a caf\u00e9. Over the wine he became suddenly less dignified,\nmore human, and almost pathetic. \"Tell me about him, Danner. I loved\nthat kid once, you know.\"\n\nHugo found himself unexpectedly moved. The man was so eager, so\nstrangely happy. He stroked his white moustache and turned away moist\neyes. So Hugo told him. He talked endlessly of the trenches and the dark\nwet nights and the fire that stabbed through them. He invented brave\nsorties for his friend, tripled his accomplishments, and put gaiety and\nwit in his mouth. The father drank every syllable as if he was\ncommitting the whole story to memory as the text of a life's solace. At\nlast he was crying.\n\n\"That was the Tom I knew,\" Hugo said softly.\n\n\"And that was the Tom I dreamed and hoped and thought he would become\nwhen he was a little shaver. Well, he did, Danner.\"\n\n\"A thousand times he did.\"\n\nRalph Jordan Shayne blew his nose unashamedly. He thought of his\npatiently waiting wife. \"I've got to go, I suppose. This has been more\nthan kind of you, Mr. Danner--Lieutenant Danner. I'm glad--more glad\nthan I can say--that you were there. I understand from the major that\nyou're no small shakes in this army yourself.\" He smiled deferentially.\n\"I wish there was something we could do for you.\"\n\n\"Nothing. Thank you, Mr. Shayne.\"\n\n\"I'm going to give you my card. In New York--my name is not without\nmeaning.\"\n\n\"It is very familiar to me. Was before I met your son.\"\n\n\"If you ever come to the city--I mean, when you come--you must look us\nup. Anything we can do--in the way of jobs, positions--\" He was\nconfused.\n\nHugo shook his head. \"That's very kind of you, sir. But I have some\nmeans of my own and, right now, I'm not even thinking of going back to\nNew York.\"\n\nMr. Shayne stepped into the car. \"I would like to do something.\" Hugo\nrealized the sincerity of that desire. He reflected.\n\n\"Nothing I can think of--\"\n\n\"I'm a banker. Perhaps--if I might take the liberty--I could handle your\naffairs?\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"My affairs consist of one bank account in the City Loan\nthat would seem very small to you, Mr. Shayne.\"\n\n\"Why, that's one of my banks. I'll arrange it. You know and I know how\nsmall the matter of money is. But I'd appreciate your turning over some\nof your capital to me. I would consider it a blessed opportunity to\nreturn a service, a great service with a small one, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Hugo said.\n\nThe banker scribbled a statement, asked a question, and raised his\neyebrows over the amount Hugo gave him. Then he was the father again.\n\"We've been to the cemetery, Danner. We owe that privilege to you. It\nsays there, in French: 'The remains of a great hero who gave his life\nfor France.' Not America, my boy; but I think that France was a worthy\ncause.\"\n\nWhen they had gone, Hugo spent a disturbed afternoon. He had not been so\nmoved in many, many months.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nNow the streets of Paris were assailed by the colour of olive drab, the\ntwang of Yankee accents, the music of Broadway songs. Hugo watched the\nfirst parade with eyes somewhat proud and not a little sombre. Each\nshuffling step seemed to ask a rhythmic question. Who would not return\nto Paris? Who would return once and not again? Who would be blind? Who\nwould be hideous? Who would be armless, legless, who would wear silver\nplates and leather props for his declining years? Hugo wondered, and,\nlooking into those sometimes stern and sometimes ribald faces, he saw\nthat they had not yet commenced to wonder.\n\nThey did not know the hammer and shock of falling shells and the jelly\nand putty which men became. They chafed and bantered and stormed every\ncaf\u00e9 and cocotte impartially, recklessly. Even the Legion had been more\ngrim and better prepared for the iron feet of war. They fell upon Hugo\nwith their atrocious French--two young men who wanted a drink and could\nnot make the bar-tender understand.\n\n\"Hey, _fransay_,\" they called to him, \"_comment dire que nous voulez des\nchoses boire?_\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"What do you birds want to drink?\"\n\n\"God Almighty! Here's a Frog that speaks United States. Get the gang.\nWhat's your name, bo?\"\n\n\"Danner.\"\n\n\"Come on an' have a flock of drinks on us. You're probably dying on\nFrench pay. You order for the gang and we'll treat.\" Eager, grinning\nAmerican faces. \"Can you get whisky in this God-forsaken dump?\"\n\n\"Straight or highball?\"\n\n\"That's the talk. Straight, Dan. We're in the army now.\"\n\nHugo drank with them. Only for one moment did they remember they were in\nthe army to fight: \"Say, Dan, the war really isn't as tough as they\nclaim, is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know how tough they claim it is.\"\n\n\"Well, you seen much fightin'?\"\n\n\"Three years.\"\n\n\"Is it true that the Heinies--?\" His hands indicated his question.\n\n\"Sometimes. Accidentally, more or less. You can't help it.\"\n\n\"And do them machine guns really mow 'em down?\"\n\nHugo shrugged. \"There are only four men in service now who started with\nmy company.\"\n\n\"Ouch! _Gar\u00e7on! Encore!_ An' tell him to make it double--no,\ntriple--Dan, old man. It may be my last.\" To Hugo: \"Well, it's about\ntime we got here an' took the war off your shoulders. You guys sure have\nhad a bellyful. An' I'm goin' to get me one right here and now. Bottoms\nup, you guys.\"\n\nHugo was transferred to an American unit. The officers belittled the\nrecommendations that came with him. They put him in the ranks. He served\nbehind the lines for a week. Then his regiment moved up. As soon as the\nguns began to rumble, a nervous second lieutenant edged toward the\ndemoted private. \"Say, Danner, you've been in this before. Do you think\nit's all right to keep on along this road the way we are?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I couldn't say. You're taking a chance. Plane strafing and\nshells.\"\n\n\"Well, what else are we to do? These are our orders.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Hugo said.\n\nWhen the first shells fell among them, however, Danner forgot that his\ntransference had cost his commission and sadly bereft Captain Crouan and\nhis command. He forgot his repressed anger at the stupidity of American\nheadquarters and their bland assumption of knowledge superior to that\ngained by three years of actual fighting. He virtually took charge of\nhis company, ignoring the bickering of a lieutenant who swore and\nshouted and accomplished nothing and who was presently beheaded for his\nlack of caution. A month later, with troops that had some feeling of\nrespect for the enemy--a feeling gained through close and gory\nassociation--Hugo was returned his commission.\n\nSlowly at first, and with increasing momentum, the war was pushed up out\nof the trenches and the Germans retreated. The summer that filled the\nwindows of American homes with gold stars passed. Hugo worked like a\nslave out beyond the front trenches, scouting, spying, destroying,\nsalvaging, bending his heart and shoulders to a task that had long since\nbecome an acid routine. September. October. November. The end of that\nholocaust was very near.\n\nThen there came a day warmer than the rest and less rainy. Hugo was\nriding toward the lines on a _camion_. He rode as much as possible now.\nHe had not slept for two days. His eyes were red and twitching. He felt\ntired--tired as if his fatigue were the beginning of death--tired so\nthat nothing counted or mattered--tired of killing, of hating, of\nsuffering--tired even of an ideal that had tarnished through long\nweathering. The _camion_ was steel and it rattled and bumped as it moved\nover the road. Hugo lay flat in it, trying to close his eyes.\n\nAfter a time, moving between the stumps of a row of poplars, they came\nabreast of a regiment returning from the battle. They walked slowly and\ndazedly. Each individual was still amazed at being alive after the\nthings he had witnessed. Hugo raised himself and looked at them. The\nsame expression had often been on the faces of the French. The long line\nof the regiment ended. Then there was an empty place on the road, and\nthe speed of the truck increased.\n\nFinally it stopped with a sharp jar, and the driver shouted that he\ncould go no farther. Hugo clambered to the ground. He estimated that the\nbattery toward which he was travelling was a mile farther. He began to\nwalk. There was none of the former lunge and stride in his steps. He\ntrudged, rather, his head bent forward. A little file of men approached\nhim, and, even at a distance, he did not need a second glance to\nidentify them. Walking wounded.\n\nBy ones and twos they began to pass him. He paid scant attention. Their\nfield dressings were stained with the blood that their progress cost.\nThey cursed and muttered. Someone had given them cigarettes, and a dozen\nwisps of smoke rose from each group. It was not until he reached the end\nof the straggling line that he looked up. Then he saw one man whose arms\nwere both under bandage walking with another whose eyes were covered and\nwhose hand, resting on his companion's shoulder, guided his stumbling\nfeet.\n\nHugo viewed them as they came on and presently heard their conversation.\n\"Christ, it hurts,\" one of them said.\n\n\"The devil with hurting, boy,\" the blinded man answered. \"So do I, for\nthat matter. I feel like there was a hot poker in my brains.\"\n\n\"Want another butt?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. Makes me kind of sick to drag on them. Wish I had a drink,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\"\n\nHugo heard his voice. \"Hey, you guys,\" it said. \"Here's some water. And\na shot of cognac, too.\"\n\nThe first man stopped and the blind man ran into him, bumping his head.\nHe gasped with pain, but his lips smiled. \"Damn nice of you, whoever you\nare.\"\n\nThey took the canteen and swallowed. \"Go on,\" Hugo said, and permitted\nhimself a small lie. \"I can get more in a couple of hours.\" He produced\nhis flask. \"And finish off on a shot of this.\"\n\nHe held the containers for the armless man and handed them to the other.\nTheir clothes were ragged and stained. Their shoes were in pieces. Sweat\nhad soaked under the blind man's armpits and stained his tunic. As Hugo\nwatched him swallow thirstily, he started. The chin and the hair were\nfamiliar. His mind spun. He knew the voice, although its tenor was sadly\nchanged.\n\n\"Good God,\" he said involuntarily, \"it's Lefty!\"\n\nLefty stiffened. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Hugo Danner.\"\n\n\"Hugo Danner?\" The tortured brain reflected.\n\n\"Hugo! Good old Hugo! What, in the name of Jesus, are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Same thing you are.\"\n\nAn odd silence fell. The man with the shattered arms broke it. \"Know\nthis fellow?\"\n\n\"Do I know him! Gee! He was at college with me. One of my buddies.\nGosh!\" His hand reached out. \"Put it there, Hugo.\"\n\nThey shook hands. \"Got it bad, Lefty?\"\n\nThe bound head shook. \"Not so bad. I guess--I kind of feel that I won't\nbe able to see much any more. Eyes all washed out. Got mustard gas in\n'em. But I'll be all right, you know. A little thing like that's\nnothing. Glad to be alive. Still have my sex appeal, anyhow. Still got\nthe old appetite. But--listen--what happened to you? Why in hell did you\nquit? Woodman nearly went crazy looking for you.\"\n\n\"Oh--\" Hugo's thoughts went back a distance that seemed infinite, into\nanother epoch and another world--\"oh, I just couldn't stick it. Say, you\nguys, wait a minute.\" He turned. His _camion_-driver was lingering in\nthe distance. \"Wait here.\" He rushed back. The armless man whistled.\n\n\"God in heaven! Your friend there can sure cover the ground.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lefty said absently. \"He always could.\"\n\nIn a moment Hugo returned. \"I got it all fixed up for you two to ride\nin. No limousine, but it'll carry you.\"\n\nLefty's lip trembled. \"Gee--Jesus Christ--\" he amended stubbornly;\n\"that's decent. I don't feel so dusty to-day. Damn it, if I had any\neyes, I guess I'd cry. Must be the cognac.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, Lefty old kid. Here, I'll give you a hand.\" He took\nLefty's arm over his shoulder, encircled him with his own, and carried\nhim rapidly over the broken road.\n\n\"Still got the old fight,\" Lefty murmured as he felt himself rushed\nforward.\n\n\"Still.\"\n\n\"Been in this mess long?\"\n\n\"Since the beginning.\"\n\n\"I should have thought of that. I often wondered what became of you.\nIris used to wonder, too.\"\n\n\"How is she?\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nThey reached the truck. Lefty sat down on the metal bottom with a sigh.\n\"Thanks, old bean. I was just about _kaputt_. Tough going, this war. I\nsaw my first shell fall yesterday. Never saw a single German at all. One\nof those squdgy things came across, and before I knew it, there was\nonion in my eye for a goal.\" The truck motor roared. The armless man\ncame alongside and was lifted beside Lefty. \"Well, Hugo, so long. You\nsure were a friend in need. Never forget it. And look me up when the\nKrauts are all dead, will you?\" The gears clashed. \"Thanks again--and\nfor the cognac, too.\" He waved airily. \"See you later.\"\n\nHugo stalked back on the road. Once he looked over his shoulder. The\ntruck was a blur of dust. \"See you later. See you later. See you later.\"\nLefty would never see him later--never see anyone ever.\n\nThat night he sat in a quiet stupor, all thought of great ideal, of fine\nabandon, of the fury of justice, and all flagrant phrases brought to an\nabrupt end by the immediate claims of his own sorrow. Tom Shayne was\nblasted to death. The stinging horror of mustard had fallen into Lefty's\neyes. All the young men were dying. The friendships he had made, the\nhuman things that gave in memory root to the earth were ripped up and\nshrivelled. That seemed grossly wrong and patently ignoble. He discarded\nhis personal travail. It was nothing. His life had been comprised of\nattempt and failure, of disappointment and misunderstanding; he was\naccustomed to witness the blunting of the edge of his hopes and the\ndulling of his desires when they were enacted.\n\nEven his great sacrifice had been vain. It was always thus. His deeds\nfrightened men or made them jealous. When he conceived a fine thing, the\nmasses, individually or collectively, transformed it into something\ncheap. His fort in the forest had been branded a hoax. His effort to\nsend himself through college and to rescue Charlotte from an unpleasant\nlife had ended in vulgar comedy. Even that had been her triumph, her\nhour, and an incongruous strain of greatness had filtered through her\npersonality rather than his. Now his years in the war were reduced to\nno grandeur, to a mere outlet for his savage instinct to destroy. After\nsuch a life, he reflected, he could no longer visualize himself engaged\nin any search for a comprehension of real values.\n\nHis mind was thorny with doubts. Seeing himself as a man made\nhypocritical by his gifts and the narrowness of the world, discarding\nhis own problem as tragically solved, Hugo then looked upon the war as\nthe same sort of colossal error. A waste. Useless, hopeless, gaining\nnothing but the temporal power which it so blatantly disavowed, it had\nexacted the price of its tawdry excitement in lives, and, now that it\nwas almost finished, mankind was ready to emerge blank-faced and\npanting, no better off than before.\n\nHis heart ached as he thought of the toil, the effort, the energy and\nhope and courage that had been spilled over those mucky fields to\nsatisfy the lusts and foolish hates of the demagogues. He was no longer\nangry. The memory of Lefty sitting smilingly on the van and calling that\nhe would see him later was too sharp an emotion to permit brain storms\nand pyrotechnics.\n\nIf he could but have ended the war single-handed, it might have been\ndifferent. But he was not great enough for that. He had been a thousand\nmen, perhaps ten thousand, but he could not be millions. He could not\nwrap his arms around a continent and squeeze it into submission. There\nwere too many people and they were too stupid to do more than fear him\nand hate him. Sitting there, he realized that his na\u00efve faith in\nhimself and the universe had foundered. The war was only another war\nthat future generations would find romantic to contemplate and dull to\nstudy. He was only a species of genius who had missed his mark by a\ncosmic margin.\n\nWhen he considered his failure, he believed that he was not thinking\nabout himself. There he was, entrusted with special missions which he\naccomplished no one knew how, and no one questioned in those hectic\ndays. Those who had seen him escape machine-gun fire, carry tons, leap a\nhundred yards, kill scores, still clung to their original concepts of\nmankind and discredited the miracle their own eyes had witnessed. Too\nmany strange things happened in that blasting carnival of destruction\nfor one strange sight or one strange man to leave a great mark. Personal\nsecurity was at too great a premium to leave much room for interest and\nspeculation. Even Captain Crouan believed he was only a man of freak\nstrength and Major Ingalls in his present situation was too busy to do\nmore than note that Hugo was capable and nod his head when Hugo reported\nanother signal victory, ascribing it to his long experience in the war\nrather than to his peculiar abilities.\n\nAs he sat empty-eyed in the darkness, smoking cigarettes and breathing\nin his own and the world's tragic futility, his own and the world's\nabysmal sorrow, that stubborn ancestral courage and determination that\nwas in him still continued to lash his reason. \"Even if the war is not\nworth while,\" it whispered, \"you have committed yourself to it. You are\nbound and pledged to see it to the bitter end. You cannot finish it on a\ndeclining note. To-night, to-morrow, you must begin again.\" At the same\ntime his lust for carnage stirred within him like a long-subdued demon.\nNow he recognized it and knew that it must be mastered. But it combined\nwith his conscience to quicken his sinews anew.\n\nIt was a cold night, but Hugo perspired. Was he to go again into the\nholocaust to avenge a friend? Was he to live over those crimson seconds\nthat followed the death of Shayne, all because he had helped a blind\nfriend into a _camion_? He knew that he was not. Never again could his\ninstinct so triumph over his reason. That was the greatest danger in\nbeing Hugo Danner. That, he commenced to see, was the explanation of all\nhis suffering in the past. The idea warmed and encouraged him.\nHenceforth his emotions and sentiments would be buried even deeper than\nhis first inbred caution had buried them. He would be a creature of\nintelligence, master of his caprice as well as of the power he possessed\nto carry out that caprice.\n\nHe lit a fresh cigarette and planned what he would do. On the next night\nhe would prepare himself very carefully. He would eat enormously,\nprovide himself with food and water, rest as much as he could, and then\nstart south and east in a plane. He would drive it far into Germany.\nWhen its petrol failed, he would crash it. Stepping from the ruins, he\nwould hasten on in the darkness, on, on, like Pheidippides, till he\nreached the centre of the enemy government. There, crashing through the\npetty human barriers, he would perform his last feat, strangling the\nEmperor, slaying the generals, pulling the buildings apart with his\nSamsonian arms, and disrupting the control of the war.\n\nHe had dreamed of such an enterprise even before he had enlisted. But he\nhad known that he lacked sufficient stamina without a great internal\ncause, and no rage, no blood-madness, was great enough to drive him to\nthat effort. With amazement he realized that a clenched determination\ndepending on the brain rather than the emotions was a greater catalyst\nthan any passion. He knew that he could do such a thing. In the warmth\nof that knowledge he completed his plan tranquilly and retired. For\ntwelve hours, by order undisturbed, Hugo slept.\n\nIn the bright morning, he girded himself. He requisitioned the plane he\nneeded through Major Ingalls. He explained that requirement by saying\nthat he was going to bomb a battery of big guns. The plane offered was\nan old one. Hugo had seen enough of flying in his French service to\nunderstand its navigation. He ate the huge meal he had planned. And\nthen, a cool and grim man, he made his way to the hangar. In fifteen\nminutes his last adventure would have commenced. But a dispatch rider,\ncharging on to the field in a roaring motor cycle, announced the\nsigning of the Armistice and the end of the war.\n\nHugo stood near his plane when he heard the news. Two men at his side\nbegan to cry, one repeating over and over: \"And I'm still alive, so help\nme God. I wish I was dead, like Joey.\" Hugo was rigid. His first gesture\nwas to lift his clenched fist and search for an object to smash with it.\nThe fist lingered in the air. His rage passed--rage that would have\nrequired a giant vent had it occurred two days sooner. He relaxed. His\narm fell. He ruffled his black hair; his blacker eyes stared and then\ntwinkled. His lips smiled for the first time in many months. His great\nshoulders sagged. \"I should have guessed it,\" he said to himself, and\nentered the rejoicing with a fervour that was unexpected.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nThere must be in heaven a certain god--a paunchy, cynical god whose task\nit is to arrange for each of the birthward-marching souls a set of\ncircumstances so nicely adjusted to its character that the result of its\nlife, in triumph or defeat, will be hinged on the finest of threads. So\nHugo must have felt coming home from war. He had celebrated the\nArmistice hugely, not because it had spared his life--most of the pomp,\nparade, bawdiness, and glory had originated in such a deliverance--but\nbecause it had rescued him from the hot blast of destructiveness. An\ninstantaneous realization of that prevented despair. He had failed in\nthe hour of becoming death itself; such failure was fortunate because\nlife to him, even at the end of the war, seemed more the effort of\ncreation than the business of annihilation.\n\nTo know that had cost a struggle--a struggle that took place at the\nhangar as the dispatch-bearer rode up and that remained crucial only\nbetween the instant when he lifted his fist and when he lowered it.\nBrevity made it no less intense; a second of time had resolved his soul\nafresh, had redistilled it and recombined it.\n\nNot long after that he started back to America. The mass of soldiers\nsurrounding him were undergoing a transition that Hugo felt vividly.\nThese men would wake up sweating at night and cry out until someone\nwhispered roughly that there were no more submarines. A door would slam\nand one of them would begin to weep. There were whisperings and\nbickerings about life at home, about what each person, disintegrated\nagain to individuality, would do and say and think. Little fears about\nlost jobs and lost girls cropped out, were thrust back, came finally to\nremain. And no one wanted life to be what it had been; no one considered\nthat it could be the same.\n\nHugo wrote to his family that the war was ended, that he was well, that\nhe expected to see them some time in the near future. The ship that\ncarried him reached the end of the blue sea; he was disembarked and\ndemobilized in New York. He realized even before he was accustomed to\nthe novelty of civilian clothes that a familiar, friendly city had\nchanged. The retrospective spell of the eighties and nineties had\nvanished. New York was brand-new, blatant, rushing, prosperous. The\ninheritance from Europe had been assimilated; a social reality, entirely\nforeign and American, had been wrought and New York was ready to spread\nit across the parent world. Those things were pressed quickly into\nHugo's mind by his hotel, the magazines, a chance novel of the precise\ndate, the cinema, and the more general, more indefinite human pulses.\n\nAfter a few days of random inspection, of casual imbibing, he called\nupon Tom Shayne's father. He would have preferred to escape all painful\nreminiscing, but he went partly as a duty and partly from necessity: he\nhad no money whatever.\n\nA butler opened the door of a large stone mansion and ushered Hugo to\nthe library, where Mr. Shayne rose eagerly. \"I'm so glad you came. Knew\nyou'd be here soon. How are you?\"\n\nHugo was slightly surprised. In his host's manner was the hardness and\nintensity that he had observed everywhere. \"I'm very well, thanks.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Cocktails, Smith.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Mr. Shayne smiled. \"Well, it's over, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"All over. And now we've got to beat the spears into plowshares, eh?\"\n\n\"We have.\"\n\nMr. Shayne chuckled. \"Some of my spears were already made into plows,\nand it was a great season for the harvest, young man--a great season.\"\n\nHugo was still uncertain of Mr. Shayne's deepest viewpoint. His\nuncertainty nettled him. \"The grim reaper has done some harvesting on\nhis own account--\" He spoke almost rudely.\n\nMr. Shayne frowned disapprovingly. \"I made up my mind to forget, Danner.\nTo forget and to buckle down. And I've done both. You'll want to know\nwhat happened to the funds I handled for you--\"\n\n\"I wasn't particularly--\"\n\nThe older man shook his head with grotesque coyness. \"Not so fast, not\nso fast. You were particularly eager to hear. We're getting honest about\nour emotions in this day and place. You're eaten with impatience.\nWell--I won't hold out. Danner, I've made you a million. A clean, cold\nmillion.\"\n\nHugo had been struggling in a rising tide of incomprehension; that\nstatement engulfed him. \"Me? A million?\"\n\n\"In the bank in your name waiting for a blonde girl.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't exactly understand, Mr. Shayne.\"\n\nThe banker readjusted his glasses and swallowed a cocktail by tipping\nback his head. Then he rose, paced across the broad carpet, and faced\nHugo. \"Of course you don't understand. Well, I'll tell you about it.\nOnce you did a favour for me which has no place in this conversation.\"\nHe hesitated; his face seemed to flinch and then to be jerked back to\nits former expression. \"In return I've done a little for you. And I want\nto add a word to the gift of your bank book. You have, if you're\ncareful, leisure to enjoy life, freedom, the world at your feet. No\nmore strife for you, no worry, and no care. Take it. Be a hedonist.\nThere is nothing else. I've lain in bed nights enjoying the life that\nlies ahead of you, my boy. Vicariously voluptuous. Catchy phrase, isn't\nit? My own. I want to see you do it up brown.\"\n\nHugo rubbed his hand across his forehead. It was not long ago that this\nsame man had sat at an _estaminet_ and wept over snatches of a childhood\nwhich death had made sacred. Here he stood now, asking that a life be\ndone up brown, and meaning cheap, obvious things. He wished that he had\nnever called on Tom's father.\n\n\"That wasn't my idea of living--\" he said slowly.\n\n\"It will be. Forget the war. It was a dream. I realized it suddenly. If\nI had not, I would still be--just a banker. Not a great banker. The\ngreat banker. I saw, suddenly, that it was a dream. The world was mad.\nSo I took my profit from it, beginning on the day I saw.\"\n\n\"How, exactly?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I mean--how did you profit by the war?\"\n\nMr. Shayne smiled expansively. \"What was in demand then, my boy? What\nwere the stupid, traduced, misguided people raising billions to get?\nWhat? Why, shells, guns, foodstuffs. For six months I had a corner on\nfour chemicals vitally necessary to the government. And the government\ngot them--at my price. I owned a lot of steel. I mixed food and\ndiplomacy in equal parts--and when the pie was opened, it was full of\nsolid gold.\"\n\nHugo's voice was strange. \"And that is the way--my money was made?\"\n\n\"It is.\" Mr. Shayne perceived that Hugo was angry. \"Now, don't get\nsentimental. Keep your eye on the ball. I--\" He did not finish, because\nMrs. Shayne came into the room. Hugo stared at him fixedly, his face\nlivid, for several seconds before he was conscious of her. Even then it\nwas only a partial consciousness.\n\nShe was stuffed into a tight, bright dress. She was holding out her\nhand, holding his hand, holding his hand too long. There was mascara\naround her eyes and they dilated and blinked in a foolish and\nflirtatious way; her voice was syrup. She was taking a cocktail with the\nother hand--maybe if he gave her hand a real squeeze, she would let go.\nA tall, sallow young man had come in behind her; he was Mr. Jerome\nLeonardo Bateau, a perfect dear. Mrs. Shayne was still holding his hand\nand murmuring; Mr. Shayne was patting his shoulder; Mr. Bateau was\nstaring with haughty and jealous eyes. Hugo excused himself.\n\nIn the hall he asked for Mr. Shayne's secretary. He collected himself in\na few frigid sentences. \"Please tell Mr. Shayne I am very grateful. I\nwish to transfer my entire fortune to my parents in Indian Creek,\nColorado. The name is Abednego Danner. Make all arrangements.\"\n\nA faint \"But--\" followed him futilely through the door. In the space of\na block he had cut a pace that set other pedestrians gaping to a fast\nwalk.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nHugo sat in Madison Square Park giving his attention in a circuit to the\nFlatiron Building, the clock on the Metropolitan Tower, and the creeping\nbarrage of traffic that sent people scampering, stopped, moved forward\nagain. He had sat on the identical bench at the identical time of day\nduring his obscure undergraduate period. To repeat that contemplative\nstasis after so much living had intervened ought to have produced an\nemotion. He had gone to the park with that idea. But the febrile fires\nof feeling were banked under the weight of many things and he could\nsuffer nothing, enjoy nothing and think but one fragmentary routine.\n\nHe had tried much and made no progress. He would be forced presently to\ndepart on a different course from a new threshold. That idea went round\nand round in his head like a single fly in a big room. It lost poignancy\nand eventually it lost meaning. Still he sat in feeble sunshine trying\nto move beyond stagnancy. He remembered the small man with the huge\nroll of bills who had moved beside him and asked for a cup of coffee. He\nremembered the woman who had robbed him; silk ankles crossed his line of\nvision, and a gusty appetite vaporized even as it steamed into the\ncoldness of his indecision.\n\nHe was without money now, as he had been then, so long ago. He budged on\nthe bench and challenged himself to think.\n\nWhat would you do if you were the strongest man in the world, the\nstrongest thing in the world, mightier than the machine? He made himself\nguess answers for that rhetorical query. \"I would--I would have won the\nwar. But I did not. I would run the universe single-handed. Literally\nsingle-handed. I would scorn the universe and turn it to my own ends. I\nwould be a criminal. I would rip open banks and gut them. I would kill\nand destroy. I would be a secret, invisible blight. I would set out to\nstamp crime off the earth; I would be a super-detective, following and\nsummarily punishing every criminal until no one dared to commit a\nfelony. What would I do? What will I do?\"\n\nThen he realized that he was hungry. He had not eaten enough in the last\nfew days. Enough for him. With some intention of finding work he had\nleft Mr. Shayne's house. A call on the telephone from Mr. Shayne himself\nvolunteering a position had crystallized that intention. In three days\nhe had discovered the vast abundance of young men, the embarrassment of\nyoung men, who were walking along the streets looking for work. He who\nhad always worked with his arms and shoulders had determined to try to\nearn his living with his head. But the white-collar ranks were teeming,\noverflowing, supersaturated. He went down in the scale of clerkships and\ninexperienced clerkships. There was no work.\n\nThence he had gone to the park, and presently he rose. He had seen the\nclusters of men on Sixth Avenue standing outside the employment\nagencies. He could go there. Any employment was better than hunger--and\nhe had learned that hunger could come swiftly and formidably to him.\nBusiness was slack, hands were being laid off; where an apprentice was\nrequired, three trained men waited avidly for work. It was appalling and\nHugo saw it as appalling. He was not frightened, but, as he walked, he\nknew that it was a mistake to sit in the park with the myriad other men.\nWalking made him feel better. It was action, it bred the thought that\nany work was better than none. Work would not hinder his dreams,\nmeantime.\n\nWhen he reached Forty-second Street he could see the sullen, watchful\ngroups of men. He joined one of them. A loose-jointed, dark-faced person\ncame down a flight of stairs, wrote on a blackboard in chalk, and went\nup again. Several of the group detached themselves and followed him--to\ncompete for a chance to wash windows.\n\nA man at his side spoke to him. \"Tough, ain't it, buddy?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's tough,\" Hugo said.\n\n\"I got three bones left. Wanna join me in a feed an' get a job\nafterward?\"\n\nHugo looked into his eyes. They were troubled and desirous of\ncompanionship. \"No, thanks,\" he replied.\n\nThey waited for the man to scribble again in chalk.\n\n\"They was goin' to fix up everybody slick after the war. Oh, hell, yes.\"\n\n\"You in it?\" Hugo asked.\n\n\"Up to my God-damned neck, buddy.\"\n\n\"Me, too. Guess I'll go up the line.\"\n\n\"I'll go witcha.\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\nThey waited a moment longer, for the man with the chalk had reappeared.\nHugo's comrade grunted. \"Wash windows an' work in the steel mills. Break\nyour neck or burn your ear off. Wha' do they care?\" Hugo had taken a\nstep toward the door, but the youth with the troubled eyes caught his\nsleeve. \"Don't go up for that, son. They burn you in them steel mills. I\nseen guys afterward. Two years an' you're all done. This is tough, but\nthat's tougher. Sweet Jesus, I'll say it is.\"\n\nHugo loosened himself. \"Gotta eat, buddy. I don't happen to have even\nthree bones available at the moment.\"\n\nThe man looked after him. \"Gosh,\" he murmured. \"Even guys like that.\"\n\nHe was in a dingy room standing before a grilled window. A voice from\nbehind it asked his name, age, address, war record. Hugo was handed a\npiece of paper to sign and then a second piece that bore the scrawled\nwords: \"Amalgamated Crucible Steel Corp., Harrison, N. J.\"\n\nHugo's emotional life was reawakened when he walked into the mills. His\nlast nickel was gone. He had left the train at the wrong station and\nwalked more than a mile. He was hungry and cold. He came, as if naked,\nto the monster and he did it homage.\n\nIts predominant colour scheme was black and red. It had a loud, pagan\nvoice. It breathed fire. It melted steel and rock and drank human sweat,\nwith human blood for an occasional stimulant. On every side of him were\nenormous buildings and woven between them a plaid of girders, cables,\nand tracks across which masses of machinery moved. Inside, Thor was\nhammering. Inside, a crane sped overhead like a tarantula, trailing its\nviscera to the floor, dangling a gigantic iron rib. A white speck in its\nwounded abdomen was a human face.\n\nThe bright metal gushed from another hole. It was livid and partially\nalive; it was hot and had a smell; it swept away the thought of the dark\ndescending night. It made a pool in a great ladle; it made a cupful\ndipped from a river in hell. A furnace exhaled sulphurously, darting a\nsnake's tongue into the sky. The mills roared and the earth shook. It\nwas bestial, reptilian--labour, and the labour of creation, and the\nengine that turned the earth could be no more terrible.\n\nHugo, standing sublimely small in its midst, measured his strength\nagainst it, soaked up its warmth, shook his fist at it, and shouted in a\nvoice that could not be heard for a foot: \"Christ Almighty! This--is\nsomething!\"\n\n\"Name?\"\n\n\"Hugo Danner.\"\n\n\"Address?\"\n\n\"None at present.\"\n\n\"Experience?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Union?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Lemme see your union card.\"\n\n\"I don't belong.\"\n\n\"Well, you gotta join.\"\n\nHe went to the headquarters of the union. Men were there of all sorts.\nThe mills were taking on hands. There was reconstruction to be done\nabroad and steel was needed. They came from Europe, for the most part.\nThickset, square-headed, small-eyed men. Men with expressionless faces\nand bulging muscles that held more meaning than most countenances. They\ngave him room and no more. They answered the same questions that he\nanswered. He stood in a third queue with them, belly to back, mouths\nclosed. He was sent to a lodging-house, advanced five dollars, and told\nthat he would be boarded and given a bed and no more until the\nemployment agency had taken its commission, and the union its dues. He\nsigned a paper. He went on the night shift without supper.\n\nHe ran a wheelbarrow filled with heavy, warm slag for a hundred feet\nover a walk of loose bricks. The job was simple. Load, carry, dump,\nreturn, load. On some later night he would count the number of loads.\nBut on this first night he walked with excited eyes, watching the\ntremendous things that happened all around him. Men ran the machinery\nthat dumped the ladle. Men guided liquid iron from the furnaces into a\nmaze of channels and cloughs, clearing the way through the sand, cutting\noff the stream, making new openings. Men wheeled the slag and steered\nthe trains and trams and cranes. Men operated the hammers. And almost\nall of the men were nude to the waist, sleek and shining with sweat;\nalmost all of them drank whisky.\n\nOne of the men in the wheelbarrow line even offered a drink to Hugo. He\nheld out the flask and bellowed in Czech. Hugo took it. The drink was\nraw and foul. Pouring into his empty stomach, it had a powerful effect,\nmaking him exalted, making him work like a demon. After a long, noisy\ntime that did not seem long a steam whistle screamed faintly and the\nshift was ended.\n\nThe Czech accompanied Hugo through the door. The new shift was already\nat work. They went out. A nightmare of brilliant orange and black fled\nfrom Hugo's vision and he looked into the pale, remote chiaroscuro of\ndawn.\n\n\"Me tired,\" the Czech said in a small, aimless tone.\n\nThey flung themselves on dirty beds in a big room. But Hugo did not\nsleep for a time--not until the sun rose and day was evident in the\ngrimy interior of the bunk house.\n\nThat he could think while he worked had been Hugo's thesis when he\nwalked up Sixth Avenue. Now, working steadily, working at a thing that\nwas hard for other men and easy for him, he nevertheless fell into the\nstolid vacuum of the manual labourer. The mills became familiar, less\nfantastic. He remembered that oftentimes the war had given a more\ndramatic passage of man's imagination forged into fire and steel.\n\nHis task was changed numerous times. For a while he puddled pig iron\nwith the long-handled, hoe-like tool.\n\n\"Don't slip in,\" they said. It was succinct, graphic.\n\nThen they put him on the hand cars that fed the furnaces. It was\npicturesque, daring, and for most men too hard. Few could manage the\nweight or keep up with the pace. Those who did were honoured by their\nfellows. The trucks were moved forward by human strength and dumped by\nhand-windlasses. Occasionally, they said, you became tired and fell\ninto the furnace. Or jumped. If you got feeling woozy, they said, quit.\nThe high rails and red mouths were hypnotic, like burning Baal and the\nJuggernaut.\n\nHugo's problems had been abandoned. He worked as hard as he dared. The\npresence of grandeur and din made him content. How long it would have\nlasted is uncertain; not forever. On the day when he had pushed up two\nhundred and three loads during his shift, the boss stopped him in the\nyard.\n\nA tall, lean, acid man. He caught Hugo's sleeve and turned him round.\n\"You're one of the bastards on the furnace line.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How many cars did you push up to-day?\"\n\n\"Two hundred and three.\"\n\n\"What the hell do you think this is, anyway?\"\n\n\"I don't get you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't, huh? Well, listen here, you God-damned athlete, what are\nyou trying to do? You got the men all sore--wearing themselves out. I\nhad to lay off three--why? Because they couldn't keep up with you,\nthat's why. Because they got their guts in a snarl trying to bust your\nrecord. What do you think you're in? A race? Somebody's got to show you\nyour place around here and I think I'll just kick a lung out right now.\"\n\nThe boss had worked himself into a fury. He became conscious of an\naudience of workers. Hugo smiled. \"I wouldn't advise you to try\nthat--even if you are a big guy.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" The words were roared. He gathered himself, but when\nHugo did not flinch, did not prepare himself, he was suddenly startled.\nHe remembered, perhaps, the two hundred and three cars. He opened his\nfist. \"All right. I ain't even goin' to bother myself tryin' to break\nyou in to this game. Get out.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Get out. Beat it. I'm firing you.\"\n\n\"Firing me? For working too hard?\" Hugo laughed. He bent double with\nlaughter. His laughter sounded above the thunder of the mill. \"Oh, God,\nthat's funny. Fire me!\" He moved toward the boss menacingly. \"I've a\nnotion to twist your liver around your neck myself.\"\n\nThe workers realized that an event of some magnitude was taking place.\nThey drew nearer. Hugo's laughter came again and changed into a\nsmile--an emotion that cooled visibly. Then swiftly he peeled up the\nsleeve of his shirt. His fist clenched; his arm bent; under the nose of\nhis boss he caused his mighty biceps to swell. His whole body trembled.\nWith his other hand he took the tall man's fingers and laid them on that\nmuscle.\n\n\"Squeeze,\" he shouted.\n\nThe boss squeezed. His face grew pallid and he let go suddenly. He tried\nto speak through his dry mouth, but Hugo had turned his back. At the\nbrick gate post he paused and drew a breath.\n\nHis words resounded like the crack of doom. \"So long!\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nIn the next four weeks Hugo knew the pangs of hunger frequently. He\nfound odd jobs, but none of them lasted. Once he helped to remove a late\nsnowstorm from the streets. He worked for five days on a subway\nexcavation. His clothes became shabby, he began to carry his razor in\nhis overcoat pocket and to sleep in hotels that demanded only\ntwenty-five cents for a night's lodging. When he considered the tens of\nthousands of men in his predicament, he was not surprised at or ashamed\nof himself. When, however, he dwelt on his own peculiar capacities, he\nwas both astonished and ashamed to meander along the dreary pavements.\n\nHunger did curious things to him. He had moments of fury, of imagined\nviolence, and other moments of fantasy when he dreamed of a rich and\nnoble life. Sometimes he meditated the wisdom of devouring one\nprodigious meal and fleeing through the dead of night to the warm south.\nOccasionally he considered going back to his family in Colorado. His\nmost bitter hours were spent in thinking of Mr. Shayne and of accepting\na position in one of Mr. Shayne's banks.\n\nIn his maculate, threadbare clothes, with his dark, aquiline face\nmatured by the war he was a sharp contrast of facts and possibilities.\nIt never occurred to him that he was young, that his dissatisfaction,\nhis idealism, his _Weltschmertz_ were integral to the life-cycle of\nevery man.\n\nAt the end of four weeks, with hunger gnawing so avidly at his core that\nhe could not pass a restaurant without twitching muscles and quivering\nnerves, he turned abruptly from the street into a cigar store and\ntelephoned to Mr. Shayne. The banker was full of sound counsel and ready\ncharity. Hugo regretted the call as soon as he heard Mr. Shayne's voice;\nhe regretted it when he was ravishing a luxurious dinner at Mr. Shayne's\nexpense. It was the weakest thing he had done in his life.\n\nNevertheless he accepted the position offered by Mr. Shayne. That same\nevening he rented a small apartment, and, lying on his bed, a clean bed,\nhe wondered if he really cared about anything or about anyone. In the\nmorning he took a shower and stood for a long time in front of the\nmirror on the bathroom door, staring at his nude body as if it were a\nrune he might learn to read, an enigma he might solve by concentration.\nThen he went to work. His affiliation with the Down Town Savings Bank\nlasted into the spring and was terminated by one of the oddest\nincidents of his career.\n\nUntil the day of that incident his incumbency was in no way unusual. He\nwas one of the bank's young men, receiving fifty dollars weekly to learn\nthe banking business. They moved him from department to department,\ngiving him mentally menial tasks which afforded him in each case a\nglimpse of a new facet of financial technique. It was fairly\ninteresting. He made no friends and he worked diligently.\n\nOne day in April when he had returned from lunch and a stroll in the\nenvirons of the Battery--returned to a list of securities and a strip\nfrom an adding machine, which he checked item by item--he was conscious\nof a stirring in his vicinity. A woman employee on the opposite side of\na wire wicket was talking shrilly. A vice-president rose from his desk\nand hastened down the corridor, his usually composed face suddenly white\nand disconcerted. The tension was cumulative. Work stopped and clusters\nof people began to chatter. Hugo joined one of them.\n\n\"Yeah,\" a boy was saying, \"it's happened before. A couple o' times.\"\n\n\"How do they know he's there?\"\n\n\"They got a telephone goin' inside and they're talkin' to him.\"\n\n\"I'll be damned.\"\n\nThe boy nodded rapidly. \"Yeah--some talk! Tellin' him what to try\nnext.\"\n\n\"Poor devil!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Hugo asked.\n\nThe boy was glad of a new and uninformed listener. \"Aw, some dumb vault\nclerk got himself locked in, an' the locks jammed an' they can't get him\nout.\"\n\n\"Which vault? The big one?\"\n\n\"Naw. The big one's got pipes for that kinda trouble. The little one\nthey moved from the old building.\"\n\n\"It's not so darn little at that,\" someone said.\n\nAnother person, a man, chuckled. \"Not so darn. But there isn't air in\nthere to last three hours. Caughlin said so.\"\n\n\"Honest to God?\"\n\n\"Honest. An' he's been there more than an hour already.\"\n\n\"Jeest!\" There was a pregnant, pictorial silence. Someone looked at\nHugo.\n\n\"What's eatin' you, Danner? Scared?\"\n\nHis face was tense and his hands were opening and closing convulsively.\n\"No,\" he answered. \"Guess I'll go down and have a look.\"\n\nHe rang for an elevator in the corridor and was carried to the basement.\nIn the small room on which the vault opened were five or six people,\namong them a woman who seemed to command the situation. The men were all\nsmoking; their attitudes were relaxed, their voices hushed.\n\nOne repeated nervously: \"Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.\"\n\n\"That won't help, Mr. Quail. I've sent for the expert and he will\nprobably have the safe open in a short time.\"\n\n\"Blowtorches?\" the swearing man asked abruptly.\n\n\"Absurd. He would cook before he was out. And three feet of steel and\nthen two feet more.\"\n\n\"Nitroglycerin?\"\n\n\"And make jelly out of him?\" The woman tapped her finger-nails with her\nglasses.\n\nAnother arrival, who carried a small satchel, talked with her in an\nundertone and then took off his coat. He went first to a telephone on\nthe wall and said: \"Gi' me the inside of the vault. Hello.... Hello? You\nthere? Are you all right?... Try that combination again.\" The\nsafe-expert held the wire and waited. Not even the faintest sounds of\nthe attempt were audible in the front room. \"Hello? You tried it?...\nWell, see if those numbers are in this order.\" He repeated a series of\ncomplicated directions. Finally he hung up. \"Says it's getting pretty\nstuffy in there. Says he's lying down on the floor.\"\n\nPeople came and went. The president himself walked in calmly and\noccupied a chair. He lit a cigar, puffed on it, and stared with\nruminative eyes at the shiny mechanism on the front of the safe.\n\n\"We are doing everything possible,\" the woman said to him crisply.\n\n\"Of course,\" he nodded. \"I called up the insurance company. We're amply\ncovered.\" A pause. \"Mrs. Robinson, post one of the guards to keep\npeople from running in and out of here. There are enough around\nalready.\"\n\nNo one had given Hugo any attention. He stood quietly in the background.\nThe expert worked and all eyes were on him. Occasionally he muttered to\nhimself. The hands of an electric clock moved along in audible jerks.\nNearly an hour passed and the room had become hazy with tobacco smoke.\nThe man working on the safe was moist with perspiration. His blue shirt\nwas a darker blue around the armpits. He lit a cigarette, set it down,\nwhirled the dials again, lit another cigarette while the first one\nburned a chair arm, and threw a crumpled, empty package on the floor.\n\nAt last he went to the phone again. He waited for some time before it\nwas answered, and he was compelled to make the man inside repeat\nfrequently. The new series of stratagems was without result. Before he\nwent again to his labours, he addressed the group. \"Air getting pretty\nbad, I guess.\"\n\n\"Is it dark?\" one of them asked tremulously.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFifteen minutes more. The expert glanced at the bank's president,\nhesitated, struggled frenziedly for a while, and then sighed. \"I'm\nafraid I can't get him out, sir. The combination is jammed and the\ntime-lock is all off.\"\n\nThe president considered. \"Do you know of anyone else who could do\nthis?\"\n\nThe man shook his head. \"No. I'm supposed to be the best. I've been\ncalled out for this--maybe six times. I never missed before. You see, we\nmake this safe--or we used to make it. And I'm a specialist. It looks\nserious.\"\n\nThe president took his cigar from his mouth. \"Well, go ahead\nanyway--until it's too late.\"\n\nHugo stepped away from the wall. \"I think I can get him out.\"\n\nThey turned toward him. The president looked at him coldly. \"And who are\nyou?\"\n\nMrs. Robinson answered. \"He's the new man Mr. Shayne recommended so\nhighly.\"\n\n\"Ah. And how do you propose to get him out, young man?\"\n\nHugo stood pensively for a moment. \"By methods known only to me. I am\ncertain I can do it--but I will undertake it only if you will all leave\nthe room.\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" Mrs. Robinson said.\n\nThe president's mouth worked. He looked more sharply at Hugo. Then he\nrose. \"Come on, everybody.\" He spoke quietly to Hugo. \"You have a nerve.\nHow much time do you want?\"\n\n\"Five minutes.\"\n\n\"Only five minutes,\" the president murmured as he walked from the\nchamber.\n\nHugo did not move until they had all gone. Then he locked the door\nbehind them. He walked to the safe and rapped on it tentatively with his\nknuckles. He removed his coat and vest. He planted his feet against the\nsteel sill under the door. He caught hold of the two handles, fidgeted\nwith his elbows, drew a deep breath, and pulled. There was a resonant,\nmetallic sound. Something gave. The edge of the seven-foot door moved\noutward and a miasma steamed through the aperture. Hugo changed his\nstance and took the door itself in his hands. His back bent. He pulled\nagain. With a reverberating clang and a falling of broken steel it swung\nout. Hugo dragged the man who lay on the floor to a window that gave on\na grated pit. He broke the glass with his fist. The clerk's chest heaved\nviolently; he panted, opened his eyes, and closed them tremblingly.\n\nHugo put on his coat and vest and unlocked the door. The people outside\nall moved toward him.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Hugo said. \"He's out.\"\n\nMrs. Robinson glanced at the clerk and walked to the safe. \"He's ruined\nit!\" she said in a shrill voice.\n\nThe president was behind her. He looked at the handles of the vault,\nwhich had been bent like hair-pins, and he stooped to examine the\nshattered bolts. Then his eyes travelled to Hugo. There was a profoundly\nstartled expression in them.\n\nThe clerk was sobbing. Presently he stopped. \"Who got me out?\"\n\nThey indicated Hugo and he crossed the floor on tottering feet. \"Thanks,\nmister,\" he said piteously. \"Oh, my God, what a wonderful thing to do!\nI--I just passed out when I saw your fingers reaching around--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Hugo interrupted. \"It's all right, buddy.\"\n\nThe president touched his shoulder. \"Come up to my office.\" A doctor\narrived. Several people left. Others stood around the demolished door.\n\nThe president was alone when Hugo entered and sat down. He was cold and\nhe eyed Hugo coldly. \"How did you do that?\"\n\nHugo shrugged. \"That's my secret, Mr. Mills.\"\n\n\"Pretty clever, I'd say.\"\n\n\"Not when you know how.\" Hugo was puzzled. His ancient reticence about\nhimself was acting together with a natural modesty.\n\n\"Some new explosive?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Electricity? Magnetism? Thought-waves?\"\n\nHugo chuckled. \"No. All wrong.\"\n\n\"Could you do it on a modern safe?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nPresident Mills rubbed his fingers on the mahogany desk. \"I presume you\nwere planning that for other purposes?\"\n\n\"What!\" Hugo said.\n\n\"Very well done. Very well acted. I will play up to you, Mr.--\"\n\n\"Danner.\"\n\n\"Danner. I'll play up to this assumption of innocence. You have saved a\nman's life. You are, of course, blushingly modest. But you have shown\nyour hand rather clearly. Hmmm.\" He smiled sardonically. \"I read a book\nabout a safe-cracker who opened a safe to get a child out--at the\nexpense of his liberty and position--or at the hazard of them, anyhow.\nMaybe you have read the same book.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Hugo answered icily.\n\n\"Safe-crackers--blasters, light fingers educated to the dials, and ears\nattuned to the tumblers--we can cope with those things, Mr.--\"\n\n\"Danner.\"\n\n\"But this new stunt of yours. Well, until we find out what it is, we\ncan't let you go. This is business, Mr. Danner. It involves money,\nmillions, the security of American finance, of the very nation. You will\nunderstand. Society cannot afford to permit a man like you to go at\nlarge until it has a thoroughly effective defence against you. Society\nmust disregard your momentary sacrifice, momentary nobleness. Your\nprocess, unknown by us, constitutes a great social danger. I do not dare\noverlook it. I cannot disregard it even after the service you have\ndone--even if I thought you never intended to put it to malicious use.\"\n\nHugo's thoughts were far away--to the fort he had built when he was a\nchild in Colorado, to the wagon he had lifted up, to the long,\ndiscouraging gauntlet of hard hearts and frightened eyes that his\nmiracles had met with. His voice was wistful when, at last, he addressed\nthe banker.\n\n\"What do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"I shan't bandy words, Danner. I propose to hang on to you until I get\nthat secret. And I shall be absolutely without mercy. That is frank, is\nit not?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"You comprehend the significance of the third degree?\"\n\n\"Not clearly.\"\n\n\"You will learn about it--unless you are reasonable.\"\n\nHugo bowed sadly. The president pressed a button. Two policemen came\ninto the room. \"McClaren has my instructions,\" he said.\n\n\"Come on.\" Hugo rose and stood between them. He realized that the whole\npantomime of his arrest was in earnest. For one brief instant the\npresident was given a glimpse of a smile, a smile that worried him for a\nlong time. He was so worried that he called McClaren on the telephone\nand added to his already abundant instructions.\n\nA handful of bystanders collected to watch Hugo cross from the bank to\nthe steel patrol wagon. It moved forward and its bell sounded. The\npolicemen had searched Hugo and now they sat dumbly beside him. He was\nhandcuffed to both of them. Once he looked down at the nickel bonds and\nup at the dull faces. His eyebrows lifted a fraction of an inch.\n\nCaptain McClaren received Hugo in a bare room shadowed by bars. He was a\nthick-shouldered, red-haired man with a flabby mouth from which\nprotruded a moist and chewed toothpick. His eyes were blue and bland.\nHe made Hugo strip nude and gave him a suit of soiled clothes. Hugo\nremained alone in that room for thirty hours without food or water. The\nstrain of that ordeal was greater than his jailers could have conceived,\nbut he bore it with absolute stoicism.\n\nEarly in the evening of the second day the lights in the room were put\nout, a glaring automobile lamp was set up on a table, he was seated in\nfront of it, and men behind the table began to question him in voices\nthat strove to be terrible. They asked several questions and ultimately\nboiled them down to one: \"How did you get that safe open?\" which was\nbawled at him and whispered hoarsely at him from the darkness behind the\nlight until his mind rang with the words, until he was waiting\nfrantically for each new issue of the words, until sweat glistened on\nhis brow and he grew weak and nauseated. His head ached splittingly and\nhis heart pounded. They desisted at dawn, gave him a glass of water,\nwhich he gulped, and a dose of castor oil, which he allowed them to\nforce into his mouth. A few hours later they began again. It was night\nbefore they gave up.\n\nThe remnant of Hugo's clenched sanity was dumbfounded at what followed\nafter that. They beat his face with fists that shot from the blackness.\nThey threw him to the floor and kicked him. When his skin did not burst\nand he did not bleed, they beat and kicked more viciously. They lashed\nhim with rubber hoses. They twisted his arms as far as they\ncould--until the bones of an ordinary man would have become dislocated.\n\nExcept for thirst and hunger and the discomfort caused by the castor\noil, Hugo did not suffer. They refined their torture slowly. They tried\nto drive a splinter under his nails; they turned on the lights and drank\nwater copiously in his presence; they finally brought a blowtorch and\nprepared to brand him. Hugo perceived that his invulnerability was to\nstand him in stead no longer. His tongue was swollen, but he could still\ntalk. Sitting placidly in his bonds, he watched the soldering iron grow\nwhite in the softly roaring flame. When, in the full light that shone on\nthe bare and hideous room, they took up the iron and approached him,\nHugo spoke.\n\n\"Wait. I'll tell you.\"\n\nMcClaren put the iron back. \"You will, eh?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, you won't.\"\n\n\"I shan't tell you, McClaren; I'll show you. And may God have mercy on\nyour filthy soul.\"\n\nThere were six men in the room. Hugo looked from one to another. He\ncould tolerate nothing more; he had followed the course of President\nMills's social theory far enough to be surfeited with it. There was\ndecision in his attitude, and not one of the six men who had worked his\ntorment in relays could have failed to feel the chill of that decision.\nThey stood still. McClaren's voice rang out: \"Cover him, boys.\"\n\nHugo stretched. His bonds burst; the chair on which he sat splintered to\nkindling. Six revolvers spat simultaneously. Hugo felt the sting of the\nbullets. Six chambers were emptied. The room eddied smoke. There was a\nharsh silence.\n\n\"Now,\" Hugo said gently, \"I will demonstrate how I opened that safe.\"\n\n\"Christ save us,\" one of the men whispered, crossing himself.\n\nMcClaren was frozen still. Hugo walked to the wall of the jail and\nstabbed his fist through it. Brick and mortar burst out on the other\nside and fell into the cinder yard. Hugo kicked and lashed with his\nfists. A large hole opened. Then he turned to the men. They broke toward\nthe door, but he caught them one by one--and one by one he knocked them\nunconscious. That much was for his own soul. Only McClaren was left. He\ncarried McClaren to the hole and dropped him into the yard. He wrenched\nopen the iron gate and walked out on the street, holding the policeman\nby the arm. McClaren fainted twice and Hugo had to keep him upright by\nclinging to his collar. It was dark. He hailed a cab and lifted the man\nin.\n\n\"Just drive out of town,\" Hugo said.\n\nMcClaren came to. They bumped along for miles and he did not dare to\nspeak. The apartment buildings thinned. Street lights disappeared. They\ntraversed a stretch of woodland and then rumbled through a small town.\n\n\"Who are you?\" McClaren said.\n\n\"I'm just a man, McClaren--a man who is going to teach you a lesson.\"\n\nThe taxi was on a smooth turnpike. It made swift time. Twice Hugo\nsatisfied the driver that the direction was all right. At last, on a\ndeserted stretch, Hugo called to the driver to stop. McClaren thought\nthat he was going to die. He did not plead. Hugo still held him by the\narm and helped him from the cab.\n\n\"Got any money on you?\" Hugo asked.\n\n\"About twenty dollars.\"\n\n\"Give me five.\"\n\nWith trembling fingers McClaren produced the bill. He put the remainder\nof his money back in his pocket automatically. The taxi-driver was\nwatching, but Hugo ignored him.\n\n\"McClaren,\" he said soberly, \"here's your lesson. I just happen to be\nthe strongest man in the world. Never tell anybody that. And don't tell\nanyone where I took you to-night--wherever it is. I shan't be here\nanyway. If you tell either of those two things, I'll eat you. Actually.\nThere was a poor devil smothering in that safe and I yanked it open and\ndragged him out. As a reward you and your dirty scavengers were put to\nwork on me. If I weren't as merciful as God Himself, you'd all be dead.\nNow, that's your lesson. Keep your mouth shut. Here is the final\nparable.\"\n\nStill holding the policeman's arm, he walked to the taxi and, to the\nastonishment of the driver, gripped the axle in one hand, lifted up the\nfront end like a derrick, and turned the entire car around. He put\nMcClaren in the back seat.\n\n\"Don't forget, McClaren.\" To the driver: \"Back to where you picked us\nup. The bird in the back seat will be glad to pay.\"\n\nThe red lamp of the cab vanished. Hugo turned in the other direction and\nbegan to run in great leaps. He slowed when he came to a town. A light\nwas burning in an all-night restaurant. Hugo produced the five-dollar\nbill.\n\n\"Give me a bucket of water--and put on about five steaks. Five.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nIt was bright morning when Hugo awoke. Through the window-pane in the\nroom where he had slept, he could see a straggling back yard; damp\nclothes moved in the breeze, and beyond was a depression green with\nyoung shoots. He descended to the restaurant and ate his breakfast.\nAutomobiles were swishing along the road outside and he could hear a\nclatter of dishes in the kitchen. Afterwards he went out doors and\nwalked through the busy centre of the village and on into the country.\n\nSun streamed upon him; the sky was blue; birds twittered in the budding\nbushes. He had almost forgotten the beauty and peacefulness of\nspringtime; now it came over him with a rush--pastel colours and fecund\nwarmth, smells of earth and rain, melodious, haphazard wind. He knew\nintuitively that McClaren would never send for him; he wondered what Mr.\nMills would say to Mr. Shayne about him. Both thoughts passed like white\nclouds over his mind and he forgot them for an indolent vegetative\ntranquillity.\n\nThe road curved over hills and descended into tinted valleys. Farmers\nwere ploughing and planting. The men at the restaurant had told him that\nhe was in Connecticut. That did not matter, for any other place would\nhave been the same on this May morning. A truck-driver offered him a\nride, which Hugo refused, and then, watching the cubic van surge away in\nthe distance, he wished fugitively that he had accepted.\n\nTwo half dollars and a quarter jingled in his pocket. His suit was seedy\nand his beard unshaven. A picture of New York ran through his mind: he\nstood far off from it gazing at the splendour of its towers in the\nmorning light; he came closer and the noise of it smote his ears;\nsuddenly he plunged into the city, his perspective vanished, and there\nrose about him the ugly, unrelated, inchoate masses of tawdriness that\nhad been glorious from a distance, while people--dour, malicious,\nselfish people who scuttled like ants--supplanted the vista of stone and\nsteel. The trite truth of the ratio between approach and enchantment\namused him. It was so obvious, yet so few mortals had the fine sense to\nwithdraw themselves. He was very happy walking tirelessly along that\nroad.\n\nAfter his luncheon he allowed a truck to carry him farther from the\ncity, deeper into the magic of spring. The driver bubbled with it--he\nwore a purple tulip in his greasy cap and he slowed down on the\nhilltops with an unassuming reverence and a na\u00efve slang that fitted well\nwith Hugo's mood. When he reached his destination, Hugo walked on with\nreluctance. Shadows of the higher places moved into the lowlands. He\ncrossed a brook and leaned over its middle on the bridge rail,\nfascinated by an underwater landscape, complete, full of colour, less\nthan a foot high. From every side came the strident music of frogs.\nSpring, spring, spring, they sang, rolling their liquid gutturals and\nstopping abruptly when he came too near.\n\nIn the evening, far from the city, he turned from the pavement on a\nmuddy country road, walking on until he reached the skeleton of an old\nhouse. There he lay down, taking his supper from his pocket and eating\nit slowly. The floor of the second story had fallen down and he could\nsee the stars through a hole in the roof. In such houses, he thought,\nthe first chapters of American history had been lived. When it was\nentirely dark, a whippoorwill began to make its sweet and mournful\nmusic. Warmth and chilliness came together from the ground. He slept.\n\nIn the morning he followed the road into the hills. Long stretches of\nwoodland were interrupted by fields. He passed farmhouses and the paved\ndrive of an estate. More than a mile from the deserted farm, more than\ntwo miles from the main road, half hidden in a skirt of venerable trees,\nhe saw an old, green house behind which was a row of barns. It was a\nbig house; tile medallions had been set in its foundations by an\narchitect whose tombstone must now be aslant and illegible. It was built\non a variety of planes and angles; gables cropped at random from its\nmossy roof. Grass grew in the broad yard under the trees, and in the\ngrass were crocuses, yellow and red and blue, like wind-strewn confetti.\n\nHugo paused to contemplate this peaceful edifice. A man walked briskly\nfrom one of the barn doors. He perceived Hugo and stopped, holding a\nspade in his hand. Then, after starting across to the house, he changed\nhis mind and, dropping the spade, approached Hugo.\n\n\"Looking for work, my man?\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"Why--yes.\"\n\n\"Know anything about cattle?\"\n\n\"I was reared in a farming country.\"\n\n\"Good.\" He scrutinized Hugo minutely. \"I'll try you at eight dollars a\nweek, room, and board.\" He opened the gate.\n\nHugo paused. The notion of finding employment somewhere in the country\nhad been fixed in his mind and he wondered why he waited, even as he\ndid, when the charm of the old manor had offered itself to him as if by\na miracle. The man swung open the gate; he was lithe, sober, direct.\n\n\"My name is Cane--Ralph Cane. We raise blooded Guernsey stock here. At\nthe moment we haven't a man.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Hugo said.\n\n\"I could make the eight ten--in a week--if you were satisfactory.\"\n\n\"I wasn't considering the money--\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I wasn't considering the money.\"\n\n\"Oh! Come in. Try it.\" An eagerness was apparent in his tone. While Hugo\nstill halted on a knoll of indecision, a woman opened the French windows\nwhich lined one fa\u00e7ade of the house and stepped down from the porch. She\nwas very tall and very slender. Her eyes were slaty blue and there was a\ndelicate suggestion--almost an apparition--of grey in her hair.\n\n\"What is it, Ralph?\" Her voice was cool and pitched low.\n\n\"This is my wife,\" Cane said.\n\n\"My name is Danner.\"\n\nCane explained. \"I saw this man standing by the gate, and now I'm hiring\nhim.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she said. She looked at Hugo. The crystalline substance of her\neyes glinted transiently with some inwardness--surprise, a vanishing\ngladness, it might have been. \"You are looking for work?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hugo answered.\n\nCane spoke hastily. \"I offered him eight a week and board, Roseanne.\"\n\nShe glanced at her husband and returned her attention inquisitively to\nHugo. \"Are you interested?\"\n\n\"I'll try it.\"\n\nCane frowned nervously, walked to his wife, and nodded with averted\nface. Then he addressed Hugo: \"You can sleep in the barn. We have\nquarters there. I don't think we'll be in for any more cold weather. If\nyou'll come with me now, I'll start you right in.\"\n\nUntil noon Hugo cleaned stables. There were two dozen cows--animals that\nwould have seemed beautiful to a rustic connoisseur--and one lordly bull\nwith malignant horns and bloodshot eyes. He shoveled the pungent and not\noffensive d\u00e9bris into a wheelbarrow and transferred it to a dung-heap\nthat sweated with internal humidity. At noon Cane came into the barn.\n\n\"Pretty good,\" he said, viewing floors fairly shaved by Hugo's\ndiligence. \"Lunch is ready. You'll eat in the kitchen.\"\n\nHugo saw the woman again. She was toiling over a stove, her hair in\ndisarray, a spotted apron covering her long body. He realized that they\nhad no servants, that the three of them constituted the human\ninhabitants of the estate--but there were shades, innumerable shades, of\na long past, and some of those ghosts had crept into Roseanne's slaty\neyes. She carried lunch for herself and her husband into a front room\nand left him to eat in the soft silence.\n\nAfter lunch Cane spoke to him again. \"Can you plough?\"\n\n\"It's been a long time--but I think so.\"\n\n\"Good. I have a team. We'll drive to the north field. I've got to start\ngetting the corn in pretty soon.\"\n\nThe room in the barn was bare: four board walls, a board ceiling and\nfloor, an iron cot, blankets, the sound and smell of the cows beneath.\nHugo slept dreamlessly, and when he woke, he was ravenous.\n\nHis week passed. Cane drove him like a slave-master, but to drive Hugo\nwas an unhazardous thing. He did not think much, and when he did, it was\nto read the innuendo of living that was written parallel to the\nexistence of his employer and Roseanne. They were troubled with each\nother. Part of that trouble sprang from an evident source: Cane was a\nmiser. He resented the amount of food that Hugo consumed, despite the\nunequal ratio of Hugo's labours. When Hugo asked for a few dollars in\nadvance, he was curtly refused. That had happened at lunch one day.\nAfter lunch, however, and evidently after Cane had debated with his\nwife, he inquired of Hugo what he wanted. A razor and some shaving\nthings and new trousers, Hugo had said.\n\nCane drove the station wagon to town and returned with the desired\narticles. He gave them to Hugo.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Hugo said.\n\nCane chuckled, opening his thin lips wide. \"All right, Danner. As a\nmatter of fact, it's money in my bank.\"\n\n\"Money in your bank?\"\n\n\"Sure. I've lived here for years and I get a ten-per-cent discount at\nthe general store. But I'm charging you full price--naturally.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Hugo agreed.\n\nThat was one thing that would make the tribulation in her eyes. Hugo\nwished that he could have met these two people on a different basis, so\nthat he could have learned the truth about them. It was plain that they\nwere educated, cultured, refined. Cane had said something once about\nraising cattle in England, and Roseanne had cooked peas as she had\nlearned to cook them in France. \"_Petits pois au beurre_,\" she had\nmurmured--with an unimpeachable accent.\n\nThen the week had passed and there had been no mention of the advance in\nwages. For himself, Hugo did not care. But it was easy to see why no one\nhad been working on the place when Hugo arrived, why they were eager to\nhire a transient stranger.\n\nHe learned part of what he had already guessed from a clerk in the\ngeneral store. One of the cows was ailing. Mr. Cane could not drive to\ntown (Mrs. Cane, it seemed, never left the house and its environs) and\nthey had sent Hugo.\n\n\"You working for the Canes?\" the clerk had asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Funny people.\"\n\nHugo replied indirectly. \"Have they lived here long?\"\n\n\"Long? Roseanne Cane was a Bishop. The Bishops built that house and the\nhouse before it--back in the seventeen hundreds. They had a lot of\nmoney. Have it still, I guess, but Cane's too tight to spend it.\" There\nwas nothing furtive in the youth's manner; he was evidently touching on\ncommon village gossip. \"Yes, sir, too tight. Won't give her a maid. But\nbefore her folks died, it was Europe every year and a maid for every one\nof 'em, and 'Why, deary, don't tell me that's the second time you've put\non that dress! Take it right off and never wear it again.'\" The joke was\npart of the formula for telling about the Canes, and the clerk snickered\nappreciatively. \"Yes, sir. You come down here some day when I ain't got\nthe Friday orders to fill an' I'll tell you some things about old man\nCane that'll turn your stummick.\"\n\nHugo accepted his bundle, set it in the seat beside himself, and drove\nback to the big, green house.\n\nLater in the day he said to Cane: \"If you will want me to drive the\nstation wagon very often, I ought to have a license.\"\n\n\"Go ahead. Get one.\"\n\n\"I couldn't afford it at the moment, and since it would be entirely for\nyou, I thought--\"\n\n\"I see,\" Cane answered calmly. \"Trying to get a license out of me. Well,\nyou're out of luck. You probably won't be needed as a chauffeur again\nfor the next year. If you are, you'll drive without a license, and drive\ndamn carefully, too, because any fines or any accidents would come out\nof your wages.\"\n\nHugo received the insult unmoved. He wondered what Cane would say if he\nsmashed the car and made an escape. He knew he would not do it; the\nwhole universe appeared so constructed that men like Cane inevitably\navoided their desserts.\n\nJune came, and July. The sea-shore was not distant and occasionally at\nnight Hugo slipped away from the woods and lay on the sand, sometimes\ndrinking in the firmament, sometimes closing his eyes. When it was very\nhot he undressed behind a pile of barnacle-covered boulders and swam far\nout in the water. He swam naked, unmolested, stirring up tiny whirlpools\nof phosphorescence, and afterwards, damp and cool, he would dress and\nsteal back to the barn through the forest and the hay-sweet fields.\n\nOne day a man in Middletown asked Mr. Cane to call on him regarding the\npossible purchase of three cows. Cane's cows were raised with the\nmaximum of human care, the minimum of extraneous expense. His profit on\nthem was great and he sold them, ordinarily, one at a time. He was so\nexcited at the prospect of a triple sale that for a day he was almost\ngay, very nearly generous. He drove off blithely--not in the sedan, but\nin the station wagon, because its gasoline mileage was greater.\n\nIt was a day filled with wonder for Hugo. When Cane drove from the\nhouse, Roseanne was standing beside the drive. She walked over to the\nbarn and said to Hugo in an oddly agitated voice: \"Mr. Danner, could you\nspare an hour or two this morning to help me get some flowers from the\nwoods?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nShe glanced in the direction her husband had taken and hurried to the\nkitchen, returning presently with two baskets and a trowel. He followed\nher up the road. They turned off on an overgrown path, pushed through\nunderbrush, and arrived in a few minutes at the side of a pond. The\nedges were grown thick with bushes and water weeds, dead trees lifted\nawkward arms at the upper end, and dragon flies skimmed over the warm\nbrown water.\n\n\"I used to come here to play when I was a little girl,\" she said. \"It's\nstill just the same.\" She wore a blue dress; branches had dishevelled\nher hair; she seemed more alive than he had ever seen her.\n\n\"It's charming,\" Hugo answered.\n\n\"There used to be a path all the way around--with stones crossing the\nbrook at the inlet. And over there, underneath those pine trees, there\nare some orchids. I've always wanted to bring them down to the house. I\nthink I could make them grow. Of course, this is a bad time to\ntransplant anything--but I so seldom get a chance. I can't remember\nwhen--when--\"\n\nHe realized with a shock that she was going to cry. She turned her head\naway and peered into the green wall. \"I think it's here,\" she said\ntremulously.\n\nThey followed a dimly discernible trail; there were deer tracks in it\nand signs of other animals whose feet had kept it passable. It was hot\nand damp and they were forced to bend low beneath the tangle to make\nprogress. Almost suddenly they emerged in a grove of white pines. They\nstood upright and looked: wind stirred sibilantly in the high tops, and\nthe ground underfoot was a soft carpet; the lake reflected the blue of\nthe sky instead of the brown of its soft bottom.\n\n\"Let's rest a minute,\" she said. And then: \"I always think a pine grove\nis like a cathedral. I read somewhere that pines inspired Gothic\narchitecture. Do you suppose it's true?\"\n\n\"There was the lotos and the Corinthian column,\" Hugo answered.\n\nThey sat down. This was a new emotion--a paradoxical emotion for him. He\nhad come to an inharmonious sanctuary and he could expect both tragedy\nand enchantment. There was Roseanne herself, a hidden beautiful thing in\nwhom were prisoned many beauties. She was growing old in the frosty\nseclusion of her husband's company. She was feeding on the toothless\nfood of dreams when her hunger was still strong. That much anyone might\nsee; the reason alone remained invisible. He was acutely conscious of an\nhour at hand, an imminent moment of vision.\n\n\"You're a strange man,\" she said finally.\n\nThat was to be the password. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"I've watched you every day from the kitchen window.\" Her depression\nhad gone now and she was talking with a vague excitement.\n\n\"Have you?\"\n\n\"Do you mind if we pretend for a minute?\"\n\n\"I'd like it.\"\n\n\"Then let's pretend this is a magic carpet and we've flown away from the\nworld and there's nothing to do but play. Play,\" she repeated musingly.\n\"I'll be Roseanne and you'll be Hugo. You see, I found out your name\nfrom the letters. I found out a lot about you. Not facts like born,\noccupation, father's first name; just--things.\"\n\nHe dared a little then. \"What sort of things, Roseanne?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I knew you could do it! That's one of them. I found out\nyou had a soul. Souls show even in barn-yards. You looked at the peonies\none day and you played with the puppies the next. In one\nway--Hugo--you're a failure as a farm hand.\"\n\n\"Failure?\"\n\n\"A flop. You never make a grammatical mistake.\" She saw his surprise and\nlaughed again. \"And your manners--and, then, you understood French.\nSee--the carpet is taking us higher and farther away. Isn't it fun!\nYou're the hired man and I'm the farmer's wife and all of a\nsudden--we're--\"\n\n\"A prince and princess?\"\n\n\"That's exactly right. I won't pretend I'm not curious--morbidly\ncurious. But I won't ask questions, either, because that isn't what the\ncarpet is for.\"\n\n\"What is it for, Roseanne?\"\n\n\"To get away from the world, silly. And now--there's a look about you.\nWhen I was a little girl, my father was a great man, and many great men\nused to come to our house. I know what the frown of power is and the\nattitude of greatness. You have them--much more than any pompous old\nmagnate I ever laid eyes on. The way you touch things and handle them,\nthe way you square your shoulders. Sometimes I think you're not real at\nall and just an imaginary knight come to storm my castle. And sometimes\nI think you're a very famous man whose afternoon walk just has been\nextended for a few months. The first thought frightens me, and the\nsecond makes me wonder why I haven't seen your picture in the Sunday\nrotogravures.\"\n\nHugo's shoulders shook. \"Poor Princess Roseanne. And what do I think\nabout you, then--\"\n\nShe held up her hand. \"Don't tell me, Hugo. I should be sad. After all,\nmy life--\"\n\n\"May be what it does not appear to be.\"\n\nShe took a brittle pine twig and dug in the mould of the needles until\nit broke. \"Ralph--was different once. He was a chemist. Then--the war\ncame. And he was there and a shell--\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Hugo said. \"And you loved him before?\"\n\n\"I had promised him before. But it changed him so. And it's hard.\"\n\n\"The carpet,\" he answered gently. \"The carpet--\"\n\n\"I almost dropped off, and then I'd have been hurt, wouldn't I?\"\n\n\"A favour for a favour. I'm not a great man, but I hope to be one. I\nhave something that I think is a talent. Let it go at that. The letters\ncome from my father and mother--in Colorado.\"\n\n\"I've never seen Colorado.\"\n\n\"It's big--\"\n\n\"Like the nursery of the Titans, I think,\" she said softly, and Hugo\nshuddered. The instinct had been too true.\n\nHer eyes were suddenly stormy. \"I feel old enough to mother you, Hugo.\nAnd yet, since you came, I've been a little bit in love with you. It\ndoesn't matter, does it?\"\n\n\"I think--I know--\"\n\n\"Sit closer to me then, Hugo.\"\n\nThe sun had passed the zenith before they spoke connectedly again. \"Time\nfor the magic carpet to come to earth,\" she said gaily.\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\n\"Don't be masculine any longer--and don't be rudely possessive. Of\ncourse it is. Aren't you hungry?\"\n\n\"I was hungry--\" he began moodily.\n\n\"All off at earth. Come on. Button me. Am I a sight?\"\n\n\"I disregard the bait.\"\n\n\"You're being funny. Come. No--wait. We've forgotten the orchids. I\nwonder if I really came for orchids. Should you be terribly offended if\nI said I thought I did?\"\n\n\"Extravagantly offended.\"\n\nCane returned late in the day. The cows had been sold--\"I even made five\nhundred clear and above the feeding and labour on the one with the off\nleg. She'll breed good cattle.\" The barns were as clean as a park, and\nRoseanne was singing as she prepared dinner.\n\nNothing happened until a hot night in August. The leaves were still and\nlimp, the moon had set. Hugo lay awake and he heard her coming quietly\nup the stairs.\n\n\"Ralph had a headache and he took two triple bromides. Of course, I\ncould always have said that I heard one of the cows in distress and came\nto wake you. But he's jealous, poor dear. And then--but who could resist\na couple of simultaneous alibis?\"\n\n\"Nobody,\" he whispered. She sat down on his bed. He put his arm around\nher and felt that she was in a nightdress. \"I wish I could see you now.\"\n\n\"Then take this flashlight--just for an instant. Wait.\" He heard the\nrustle of her clothing. \"Now.\"\n\nShe heard him draw in his breath. Then the light went out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the approach of autumn weather Roseanne caught a cold. She\ncontinued her myriad tasks, but he could see that she was miserable.\nEven Cane sympathized with her gruffly. When the week of the cattle show\nin New York arrived, the cold was worse and she begged off the long trip\non the trucks with the animals. He departed alone with his two most\nprecious cows, scarcely thinking of her, muttering about judges and\nprizes.\n\nAgain she came out to the barn. \"You've made me a dreadful hypocrite.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"You were waiting for me! Men are so disgustingly sure of everything!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I've made myself cough and sniffle until I can't stop.\"\n\nHugo smiled broadly. \"All aboard the carpet....\"\n\nThey lay in a field that was surrounded by trees. The high weeds hid\nthem. Goldenrod hung over them. \"Life can't go on--\"\n\n\"Like this,\" he finished for her.\n\n\"Well--can it?\"\n\n\"It's up to you, Roseanne. I never knew there were women--\"\n\n\"Like me? You should have said 'was a woman.'\"\n\n\"Would you run away with me?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Aren't we just hunting for an emotion?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Because there was a day--one day--in the pines--\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Different from these other two. That's because of the tragic\nformation of life. There is only one first, only one commencement, only\none virginity. Then--\"\n\n\"Character sets in.\"\n\n\"Then it becomes living. It may remain beautiful, but it cannot remain\noriginal.\"\n\n\"You'd be hard to live with.\"\n\n\"Why, Roseanne?\"\n\n\"Because you're so determined not to have an illusion.\"\n\n\"And you--\"\n\n\"Go on. Say it. I'm so determined to have one.\"\n\n\"Are we quarreling? I can fix that. Come closer, Roseanne.\" Her face\nchanged through delicate shades of feeling to tenderness and to\nintensity. Abruptly Hugo leaped to his feet.\n\nThe rhythmic thunder rode down upon them like the wind. A few yards\naway, head down, tail straight, the big bull charged over the ground\nlike an avalanche. Roseanne lifted herself in time to see Hugo take two\nquick steps, draw back his fist, and hit the bull between the horns. It\nwas a diabolical thing. The bull was thrown back upon itself. Its neck\nsnapped loudly. Its feet crumpled; it dropped dead. Twenty feet to one\nside was a stone wall. Hugo picked up a hoof and dragged the carcass to\nthe base of the wall. With his hand he made an indenture in the rocks,\nand over the face of the hollow he splashed the bull's blood. Then he\napproached Roseanne. The whole episode had occupied less than a minute.\n\nShe had hunched her shoulders together, and her face was pale. She\narticulated with difficulty. \"The bull\"--her hands twitched--\"broke in\nhere--and you hit him.\"\n\n\"Just in time, Roseanne.\"\n\n\"You killed him. Then--why did you drag him over there?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Hugo answered slowly, \"I thought it would be better to make\nit seem as if he charged the wall and broke his neck that way.\"\n\nHer frigidity was worse than any hysteria. \"It isn't natural to be able\nto do things like that. It isn't human.\"\n\nHe swallowed; those words in that stifled intonation were very familiar.\n\"I know it. I'm very strong.\"\n\nRoseanne looked down at the grass. \"Wipe your hand, will you?\"\n\nHe rubbed it in the earth. \"You mustn't be frightened.\"\n\n\"No?\" She laughed a little. \"What must I be, then? I'm alive, I'm\ncrawling with terror. Don't touch me!\" She screamed and drew back.\n\n\"I can explain it.\"\n\n\"You can explain everything! But not that.\"\n\n\"It was an idiotic, wild, unfair thing to have happen at this time,\" he\nsaid. \"My life's like that.\" He looked beyond her. \"I began wanting to\ndo tremendous things. The more I tried, the more discouraged I became.\nYou see, I was strong. There have been other things figuratively like\nthe bull. But the things themselves get littler and more preposterous,\nbecause my ambition and my nerve grows smaller.\" He lowered his head.\n\"Some day--I shan't want to do anything at all any more. Continuous and\nunwonted defeat might infuriate some men to a great effort. It's tiring\nme.\" He raised his eyes sadly to hers. \"Roseanne--!\"\n\nShe gathered her legs under herself and ran. Hugo made no attempt to\nfollow her. He merely watched. Twice she tripped and once she fell. At\nthe stone wall she looked back at him. It was not necessary to be able\nto see her expression. She went on across the fields--a skinny, flapping\nthing--at last a mere spot of moving colour.\n\nHugo turned and stared at the brown mound of the bull. After a moment he\nwalked over and stood above it. Its tongue hung out and its mouth\ngrinned. It lay there dead, and yet to Hugo it still had life: the\nindestructibility of a ghost and the immortality of a symbol. He sat\nbeside it until sundown.\n\nAt twilight he entered the barn and tended the cows. The doors of the\nhouse were closed. He went without supper. Cane returned jubilantly\nlater in the evening. He called Hugo from the back porch.\n\n\"Telegram for you.\"\n\nHugo read the wire. His father was sick and failing rapidly. \"I want my\nwages,\" he said. Then he went back to the barn. His trifling belongings\nwere already wrapped in a bundle. Cane reluctantly counted out the\nmoney. Hugo felt nauseated and feverish. He put the money in his pocket,\nthe bundle under his arm; he opened the gate, and his feet found the\nsoft earth of the road in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nHugo had three hours to wait for a Chicago train. His wages purchased\nhis ticket and left him in possession of twenty dollars. His clothing\nwas nondescript; he had no baggage. He did not go outside the Grand\nCentral Terminal, but sat patiently in the smoking-room, waiting for the\ntime to pass. A guard came up to him and asked to see his ticket. Hugo\ndid not remonstrate and produced it mechanically; he would undoubtedly\nbe mistaken for a tramp amid the sleek travellers and commuters.\n\nWhen the train started, his fit of perplexed lethargy had not abated.\nHis hands and feet were cold and his heart beat slowly. Life had\naccustomed him to frustration and to disappointment, yet it was\nagonizing to assimilate this new cudgeling at the hands of fate. The old\ngreen house in the Connecticut hills had been a refuge; Roseanne had\nbeen a refuge. They were, both of them, peaceful and whimsical and they\nhad seemed innocent of the capacity for great anguish. Every man dreams\nof the season-changed countryside as an escape; every man dreams of a\nwoman on whose broad breast he may rest, beneath whose tumbling hair and\nmoth-like hands he may discover forgetfulness and freedom. Some men are\nsuccessful in a quest for those anodynes. Hugo could understand the\nsharp contours of one fact: because he was himself, such a quest would\nalways end in failure. No woman lived who could assuage him; his fires\nwould not yield to any temporal powers.\n\nHe was barren of desire to investigate deeper into the philosophy of\nhimself. All people turned aside by fate fall into the same morass.\nExcept in his strength, Hugo was pitifully like all people: wounds could\neasily be opened in his sensitiveness; his moral courage could be taxed\nto the fringe of dilemma; he looked upon his fellow men sometimes with\nawe at the variety of high places they attained in spite of the heavy\nhandicap of being human--he looked upon them again with repugnance--and\nvery rarely, as he grew older, did such inspections of his kind include\na study of the difference between them and him made by his singular\ngift. When that thought entered his mind, it gave rise to peculiar\nspeculations.\n\nHe approached thirty, he thought, and still the world had not re-echoed\nwith his name; the trumps, banners, and cavalcade of his glory had been\nonly shadows in the sky, dust at sunset that made evanescent and\nintangible colours. Again, he thought, the very perfection of his\nprowess was responsible for its inapplicability; if he but had an\nAchilles' heel so that his might could taste the occasional tonic of\ninadequacy, then he could meet the challenge of possible failure with\nsuccessful effort. More frequently he condemned his mind and spirit for\nnot being great enough to conceive a mission for his thews. Then he\nwould fall into a reverie, trying to invent a creation that would be as\nmagnificent as the destructions he could so easily envision.\n\nIn such a painful and painstaking mood he was carried over the\nAlleghenies and out on the Western plains. He changed trains at Chicago\nwithout having slept, and all he could remember of the journey was a\nprotracted sorrow, a stabbing consciousness of Roseanne, dulled by his\nlast picture of her, and a hopeless guessing of what she thought about\nhim now.\n\nHugo's mother met him at the station. She was unaltered, everything was\nunaltered. The last few instants in the vestibule of the train had been\na series of quick remembrances; the whole countryside was like a\nlong-deserted house to which he had returned. The mountains took on a\nfamiliar aspect, then the houses, then the dingy red station. Lastly his\nmother, upright and uncompromisingly grim, dressed in her perpetual\nmourning of black silk. Her recognition of Hugo produced only the\nslightest flurry and immediately she became mundane.\n\n\"Whatever made you come in those clothes?\"\n\n\"I was working outdoors, mother. I got right on a train. How is father?\"\n\n\"Sinking slowly.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I'm in time.\"\n\n\"It's God's will.\" She gazed at him. \"You've changed a little, son.\"\n\n\"I'm older.\" He felt diffident. A vast gulf had risen between this\nvigorous, religious woman and himself.\n\nShe opened a new topic. \"Whatever in the world made you send us all that\nmoney?\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"Why--I didn't need it, mother. And I thought it would make\nyou and father happy.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Perhaps. It has done some good. I've sent four missionaries\nout in the field and I am thinking of sending two more. I had a new\naddition put on the church, for the drunkards and the fallen. And we put\na bathroom in the house. Your father wanted two, but I wouldn't hear of\nit.\"\n\n\"Have you got a car?\"\n\n\"Car? I couldn't use one of those inventions of Satan. Your father made\nme hire this one to meet you. There's Anna Blake's house. She married\nthat fellow she was flirting with when you went away. And there's our\nhouse. It was painted last month.\"\n\nNow all the years had dropped away and Hugo was a child again, an\nadolescent again. The car stopped.\n\n\"You can go right up. He's in the front room. I'll get lunch.\"\n\nHugo's father was lying on the bed watching the door. A little wizened\nold man with a big head and thin yellow hands. Illness had made his eyes\nrheumy, but they lighted up when his son entered, and he half raised\nhimself.\n\n\"Hello, father.\"\n\n\"Hugo! You've come back.\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"I've waited for you. Sit down here on the bed. Move me over a little.\nNow close the door. Is it cold out? I was afraid you might not get here.\nI was afraid you might get sick on the train. Old people are like that,\nHugo.\" He shaded his eyes. \"You aren't a very big man, son. Somehow I\nalways remembered you as big. But--I suppose\"--his voice thinned--\"I\nsuppose you don't want to talk about yourself.\"\n\n\"Anything you want to hear, father.\"\n\n\"I can't believe you came back.\" He ruminated. \"There were a thousand\nthings I wanted to ask you, son--but they've all gone from my mind. I'm\nnot so easy in your presence as I was when you were a little shaver.\"\n\nHugo knew what those questions would be. Here, on his death-bed, his\nfather was still a scientist. His soul flinched from giving its account.\nHe saw suddenly that he could never tell his father the truth; pity,\nkindredship, kindness, moved him. \"I know what you wanted to ask,\nfather. Am I still strong?\" It took courage to suggest that. But he was\nrewarded. The old man sighed ecstatically. \"That's it, Hugo, my son.\"\n\n\"Then--father, I am. I grew constantly stronger when I left you. In\ncollege I was strong. At sea I was strong. In the war. First I wanted to\nbe mighty in games and I was. Then I wanted to do services. And I did,\nbecause I could.\"\n\nThe head nodded on its feeble neck. \"You found things to do? I--I hoped\nyou would. But I always worried about you. Every day, son, every day for\nall these years, I picked up the papers and looked at them with\nmisgivings. 'Suppose,' I said to myself, 'suppose my boy lost his temper\nlast night. Suppose someone wronged him and he undertook to avenge\nhimself.' I trusted you, Hugo. I could not quite trust--the other thing.\nI've even blamed myself and hated myself.\" He smiled. \"But it's all\nright--all right. So I am glad. Then, tell me--what--what--\"\n\n\"What have I done?\"\n\n\"Do you mind? It's been so long and you were so far away.\"\n\n\"Well--\" Hugo swept his memory back over his career--\"so many things,\nfather. It's hard to recite one's own--\"\n\n\"I know. But I'm your father, and my ears ache to hear.\"\n\n\"I saved a man pinned under a wagon. I saved a man from a shark. I\npulled open a safe in which a man was smothering. Many things like that.\nThen--there was the war.\"\n\n\"I know. I know. When you wrote that you had gone to war, I was\nfrightened--and happy. Try as I might, I could not think of a great\nconstructive cause for you to enter. I had to satisfy myself by thinking\nthat you could find such a cause. Then the war came. And you wrote that\nyou were in it. I was happy. I am old, Hugo, and perhaps my nationalism\nand my patriotism are dead. Sides in a war did not seem to matter. But\npeace mattered to me, and I thought--I hoped that you could hasten\npeace. Four years, Hugo. Your letters said nothing. Four years. And then\nit stopped. And I understood. War is property fighting property, not\nDavid fighting Goliath. The greatest David would be unavailing now. Even\nyou could do little enough.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not so little, father.\"\n\n\"There were things, then?\"\n\nHugo could not disappoint his father with the whole formidable truth.\n\"Yes.\" He lied with a steady gaze. \"I stopped the war.\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"After four years I perceived the truth of what you have just said. War\nis a mistake. It is not sides that matter. The object of war is to make\npeace. On a dark night, father, I went alone into the enemy lines. For\none hundred miles that night I upset every gun, I wrecked every\nammunition train, I blew up every dump--every arsenal, that is. Alone I\ndid it. The next day they asked for peace. Remember the false armistice?\nSomehow it leaked out that there would be victory and surrender the\nnext night--because of me. Only the truth about me was never known. And\na day later--it came.\"\n\nThe weak old man was transported. He raised himself up on his elbows.\n\"You did that! Then all my work was not in vain. My dream and my prayer\nwere justified! Oh, Hugo, you can never know how glad I am you came and\ntold me this. How glad.\"\n\nHe repeated his expression of joy until his tongue was weary; then he\nfell back. Hugo sat with shining eyes during the silence that followed.\nHis father at length groped for a glass of water. Strength returned to\nhim. \"I could ask for no more, son. And yet we are petulant, insatiable\ncreatures. What is doing now? The world is wicked. Yet it tries\nhalf-heartedly to rebuild itself. One great deed is not enough--or are\nyou tired?\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"Am I ever tired, father? Am I vulnerable?\"\n\n\"I had forgotten. It is so hard for the finite mind to think beyond\nitself. Not tired. Not vulnerable. No. There was Samson--the cat.\" He\nwas embarrassed. \"I hurt you?\"\n\n\"No, father.\" He repeated it. Every gentle fall of the word \"father\"\nfrom his lips and every mention of \"son\" by his father was rare\nprivilege, unfamiliar elixir to the old man. His new lie took its cue\nfrom Abednego Danner's expressions. \"My work goes on. Now it is with\nAmerica. I expect to go to Washington soon to right the wrongs of\npolitics and government. Vicious and selfish men I shall force from\ntheir high places. I shall secure the idealistic and the courageous.\" It\nwas a theory he had never considered, a possible practice born of\nnecessity. \"The pressure I shall bring against them will be physical and\nmental. Here a man will be driven from his house mysteriously. There a\nman will slip into the limbo. Yonder an inconspicuous person will\nsuddenly be braced by a new courage; his enemies will be gone and his\nwork will progress unhampered. I shall be an invisible agent of\nright--right as best I can see it. You understand, father?\"\n\nAbednego smiled like a happy child. \"I do, son. To be you must be\nsplendid.\"\n\n\"The most splendid thing on earth! And I have you to thank, you and your\ngenius to tender gratitude to. I am merely the agent. It is you that\ncreated and the whole world that benefits.\"\n\nAbednego's face was serene--not smug, but transfigured. \"I yearned as\nyou now perform. It is strange that one cloistered mortal can become\ninspired with the toil and lament of the universe. Yet there is a danger\nof false pride in that, too. I am apt to fall into the pit because my\ncup is so full here at the last. And the greatest problem of all is not\nsettled.\"\n\n\"What problem?\" Hugo asked in surprise.\n\n\"Why, the problem that up until now has been with me day and night.\nShall there be made more men like you--and women like you?\"\n\nThe idea staggered Hugo. It paralyzed him and he heard his father's\nvoice come from a great distance. \"Up in the attic in the black trunk\nare six notebooks wrapped in oilpaper. They were written in pencil, but\nI went over them carefully in ink. That is my life-work, Hugo. It is the\nsecret--of you. Given those books, a good laboratory worker could go\nthrough all my experiments and repeat each with the same success. I\ntried a little myself. I found out things--for example, the effect of\nthe process is not inherited by the future generations. It must be done\nover each time. It has seemed to me that those six little books--you\ncould slip them all into your coat pocket--are a terrible explosive.\nThey can rip the world apart and wipe humanity from it. In malicious\nhands they would end life. Sometimes, when I became nervous waiting for\nthe newspapers, waiting for a letter from you, I have been sorely\ntempted to destroy them. But now--\"\n\n\"Now?\" Hugo echoed huskily.\n\n\"Now I understand. There is no better keeping for them than your own. I\ngive them to you.\"\n\n\"Me!\"\n\n\"You, son. You must take them, and the burden must be yours. You have\ngrown to manhood now and I am proud of you. More than proud. If I were\nnot, I myself would destroy the books here on this bed. Matilda would\nbring them and I would watch them burn so that the danger would go\nwith--\" he cleared his throat--\"my dream.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"You cannot deny me. It is my wish. You can see what it means. A world\ngrown suddenly--as you are.\"\n\n\"I, father--\"\n\n\"You have not avoided responsibility. You will not avoid this, the\ngreatest of your responsibilities. Since the days when I made those\nnotes--what days!--biology has made great strides. For a time I was\nanxious. For a time I thought that my research might be rediscovered.\nBut it cannot be. Theory has swung in a different direction.\" He smiled\nwith inner amusement. \"The opticians have decided that the microscope I\nmade is impossible. The biochemists, moving through the secretions of\nsuch things as hippuric acid in the epithelial cells, to enzymes, to\nhormones, to chromosomes, have put a false construction on everything.\nIt will take hundreds, thousands of years to see the light. The darkness\nis so intense and the error so plausible that they may never see again\nexactly as I saw. The fact of you, at best, may remain always no more\nthan a theory. This is not vanity. My findings were a combination of\naccidents almost outside the bounds of mathematical probability. It is\nyou who must bear the light.\"\n\nHugo felt that now, indeed, circumstance had closed around him and left\nhim without succour or recourse. He bowed his head. \"I will do it,\nfather.\"\n\n\"Now I can die in peace--in joy.\"\n\nWith an almost visible wrench Hugo brought himself back to his\nsurroundings. \"Nonsense, father. You'll probably get well.\"\n\n\"No, son. I've studied the progress of this disease in the lower\norders--when I saw it imminent. I shall die--not in pain, but in sleep.\nBut I shall not be dead--because of you.\" He held out his hand for Hugo.\n\nSome time later the old professor fell asleep and Hugo tiptoed from the\nroom. Food was sizzling downstairs in the kitchen, but he ignored it,\ngoing out into the sharp air by the front door. He hastened along the\nstreets and soon came to the road that led up the mountain. He climbed\nrapidly, and when he dared, he discarded the tedious little steps of all\nmankind. He reached the side of the quarry where he had built the stone\nfort, and seated himself on a ledge that hung over it. Trees, creepers,\nand underbrush had grown over the place, but through the\nOctober-stripped barricade of their branches he could see a heap of\nstones that was his dolmen, on which the hieroglyph of him was\ninscribed.\n\nTwo tears scalded his cheeks; he trembled with the welter of his\nemotions. He had failed his father, failed his trust, failed the world;\nand in the abyss of that grief he could catch no sight of promise or\nhope. Having done his best, he had still done nothing, and it was\nnecessary for him to lie to put the thoughts of a dying man to rest. The\npity of that lie! The folly of the picture he had painted of\nhimself--Hugo Danner the scourge of God, Hugo Danner the destroying\nangel, Hugo Danner the hero of a quick love-affair that turned brown\nand dead like a plucked flower, the sentimental soldier, the involuntary\nmisanthrope.\n\n\"I must do it!\" he whispered fiercely. The ruined stones echoed the\nsound of his voice with a remote demoniac jeer. Do what? What, strong\nman? What?\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nNow the winds keened from the mountains, and snow fell. Abednego Danner,\nthe magnificent Abednego Danner, was carried to his last resting-place,\nthe laboratory of nature herself. His wife and his son followed the\nbier; the dirge was intoned, the meaningless cadence of ritual was\nspoken to the cold ground; a ghostly obelisk was lifted up over his\nmeagre remains. Hugo had a wish to go to the hills and roll down some\ngigantic chunk of living rock to mark that place until the coming of a\nglacier, but he forbore and followed all the dark conventions of\ndisintegration.\n\nThe will was read and the bulk of Hugo's sorry gains was thrust back\ninto his keeping. He went into the attic and opened the black trunk\nwhere the six small notebooks lay in oilpaper. He took them out and\nunwrapped them. The first two books were a maze of numbered experiments.\nIn the third a more vigorous calligraphy, a quivering tracery of\nexcitement, marked the repressed beginning of a new earth.\n\nHe bought a bag and some clothes and packed; the false contralto of his\nmother's hymns as she went about the house filled him with such despair\nthat he left after the minimum interval allowed by filial decency. She\nwas a grim old woman still, one to whom the coming of the kingdom to\nAfrica was a passion, the polishing of the coal stove a duty, and the\npresence of her unfamiliar son a burden.\n\nWhen he said good-by, he kissed her, which left her standing on the\nstation platform looking at the train with a flat, uncomprehending\nexpression. Hugo knew where he was going and why: he was on his way to\nWashington. The great crusade was to begin. He had no plans, only\nideals, which are plans of a sort. He had told his father he was making\nthe world a better place, and the idea had taken hold of him. He would\ngrapple the world, his world, at its source; he would no longer attempt\nto rise from a lowly place; he would exert his power in the highest\nplaces; government, politics, law, were malleable to the force of one\nman.\n\nMost of his illusion was gone. As he had said so glibly to his father,\nthere were good men and corrupt in the important situations in the\nworld; to the good he would lend his strength, to the corrupt he would\nexhibit his embattled antipathy. He would be not one impotent person\nseeking to dominate, but the agent of uplift. He would be what he\nperceived life had meant him to be: an instrument. He could not be a\nleader, but he could create a leader.\n\nSuch was his intention; he had seen a new way to reform the world, and\nif his inspiration was clouded occasionally with doubt, he disavowed the\ndoubts as a Christian disavows temptation. This was to be his\nmagnificent gesture; he closed his eyes to the inferences made by his\npast.\n\nHe never thought of himself as pathetic or quixotic; his ability to\nmeasure up to external requirements was infinite; his disappointment lay\nalways (he thought) in his spirit and his intelligence. He went to\nWashington: the world was pivoting there.\n\nHis first few weeks were dull. He installed himself in a pleasant house\nand hired two servants. The use to which he was putting his funds\ncompensated for their origin. It was men like Shayne who would suffer\nfrom his mission. And such a man came into view before very long.\n\nHugo interested himself in politics and the appearance of politics. He\nread the _Congressional Record_, he talked with everyone he met, he went\ndaily to the Capitol and listened to the amazing pattern of harangue\nfrom the lips of innumerable statesmen. In looking for a cause his eye\nfell naturally on the problem of disarmament. Hugo saw at once that it\nwas a great cause and that it was bogged in the greed of individuals. It\nis not difficult to become politically partisan in the Capitol of any\nnation. It was patent to Hugo that disarmament meant a removal of the\nchance for war; Hugo hated war. He moved hither and thither, making\nfriends, learning, entertaining, never exposing his plan--which his new\nfriends thought to be lobbying for some impending legislation.\n\nHe picked out an individual readily enough. Some of the men he had come\nto know were in the Senate, others in the House of Representatives,\nothers were diplomats, newspaper reporters, attach\u00e9s. Each alliance had\nbeen cemented with care and purpose. His knowledge of an enemy came by\nwhisperings, by hints, by plain statements.\n\nCongressman Hatten, who argued so eloquently for laying down arms and\npicking up the cause of humanity, was a guest of Hugo's.\n\n\"Danner,\" he said, after a third highball, \"you're a sensible chap. But\nyou don't quite get us. I'm fighting for disarmament--\"\n\n\"And making a grand fight--\"\n\nThe Congressman waved his hand. \"Sure. That's what I mean. You really\nwant this thing for itself. But, between you and me, I don't give a rap\nabout ships and guns. My district is a farm district. We aren't\ninterested in paying millions in taxes to the bosses and owners in a\ncoal and iron community. So I'm against it. Dead against it--with my\nconstituency behind me. Nobody really wants to spend the money except\nthe shipbuilders and steel men. Maybe they don't, theoretically. But\nthe money in it is too big. That's why I fight.\"\n\n\"And your speeches?\"\n\n\"Pap, Danner, pure pap. Even the yokels in my home towns realize that.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem like pap to me.\"\n\n\"That's politics. In a way it isn't. Two boys I was fond of are lying\nover there in France. I don't want to make any more shells. But I have\nto think of something else first. If I came from some other district,\nthe case would be reversed. I'd like to change the tariff. But the\nindustrials oppose me in that. So we compromise. Or we don't. I think I\ncould put across a decent arms-limitation bill right now, for example,\nif I could get Willard Melcher out of town for a month.\"\n\n\"Melcher?\"\n\n\"You know him, of course--at least, who he is. He spends the steel money\nhere in Washington--to keep the building program going on. Simple thing\nto do. The Navy helps him. Tell the public about the Japanese menace,\nthe English menace, all the other menaces, and the public coughs up for\nbigger guns and better ships. Run 'em till they rust and nobody ever\nreally knows what good they could do.\"\n\n\"And Melcher does that?\"\n\nThe Congressman chuckled. \"His pay-roll would make your eyes bulge. But\nyou can't touch him.\"\n\nHugo nodded thoughtfully. \"Don't you think anyone around here works\npurely for an idea?\"\n\n\"How's that? Oh--I understand. Sure. The cranks!\" And his laughter ended\nthe discussion.\n\nHugo began. He walked up the brick steps of Melcher's residence and\npulled the glittering brass knob. A servant came to the door.\n\n\"Mr. Danner to see Mr. Melcher. Just a moment.\"\n\nA wait in the hall. The servant returned. \"Sorry, but he's not in.\"\n\nHugo's mouth was firm. \"Please tell him that I saw him come in.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but he is going right out.\"\n\n\"Tell him--that he will see me.\"\n\nThe servant raised his voice. \"Harry!\" A heavy person with a flattened\nnose and cauliflower ears stepped into the hall. \"This gentleman wishes\nto see Mr. Melcher, and Mr. Melcher is not in--to him. Take care of him,\nHarry.\" The servant withdrew.\n\n\"Run along, fellow.\"\n\nHugo smiled. \"Mr. Melcher keeps a bouncer?\"\n\nAn evil light flickered in the other's eyes. \"Yeah, fellow. And I came\nup from the Pennsy mines. I'm a tough guy, so beat it.\"\n\n\"Not so tough your ears and nose aren't a sight,\" Hugo said lightly.\n\nThe man advanced. His voice was throaty. \"Git!\"\n\n\"You go to the devil. I came here to see Melcher and I'm going to see\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\nThe tough one drew back his fist, but he never understood afterwards\nwhat had taken place. He came to in the kitchen an hour later. Mr.\nMelcher heard him rumble to the floor and emerged from the library. He\nwas a huge man, bigger than his bouncer; his face was hard and sinister\nand it lighted with an unpleasant smile when he saw the unconscious thug\nand measured the size of Hugo. \"Pulled a fast one on Harry, eh?\"\n\n\"I came to see you, Melcher.\"\n\n\"Well, might as well come in now. I worked up from the mines myself, and\nI'm a hard egg. If you got funny with me, you'd get killed. Wha' daya\nwant?\"\n\nHugo sat down in a leather chair and lit a cigarette. He was\ncomparatively without emotion. This was his appointed task and he would\nmake short shrift of it. \"I came here, Melcher,\" he began, \"to talk\nabout your part in the arms conferences. It happens that I disagree with\nyou and your propaganda. It happens that I have a method of enforcing my\nopinion. Disarmament is a great thing for the world, and putting the\nidea across is the first step toward even bigger things. I know the\nrelative truths of what you say about America's peril and what you get\nfrom saying it. Am I clear?\"\n\nMelcher had reddened. He nodded. \"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to add. Get out of town.\"\n\nMelcher's eyes narrowed. \"Do you really believe that sending me out of\ntown would do any good? Do you have the conceit to think that one nutty\nshrimp like you can buck the will and ideas of millions of people?\"\n\nHugo did not permit his convictions to be shaken. \"There happen to be\nextenuating circumstances, Melcher.\"\n\n\"Really? You surprise me.\" The broad sarcasm was shaken like a weapon.\n\"And do you honestly think you could chase me--me--out of here?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nHugo extinguished his cigarette. \"I happen to be more than a man. I\nam--\" he hesitated, seeking words--\"let us say, a devil, or an angel, or\na scourge. I detest you and what you stand for. If you do not leave--I\ncan ruin your house and destroy you. And I will.\" He finished his words\nalmost gently.\n\nMelcher appeared to hesitate. \"All right. I'll go. Immediately. This\nafternoon.\"\n\nHugo was astonished. \"You will go?\"\n\n\"I promise. Good afternoon, Mr. Danner.\"\n\nHugo rose and walked toward the door. He was seething with surprise and\nsuspicion. Had he actually intimidated Melcher so easily? His hand\ntouched the knob. At that instant Melcher hit him on the head with a\nchair. It broke in pieces. Hugo turned around slowly.\n\n\"I understand. You mistook me for a dangerous lunatic. I was puzzled for\na moment. Now--\"\n\nMelcher's jaw sagged in amazement when Hugo did not fall. An instant\nlater he threw himself forward, arms out, head drawn between his\nshoulders. With one hand Hugo imprisoned his wrists. He lifted Melcher\nfrom the floor and shook him. \"I meant it, Melcher. And I will give you\na sign. Rotten politics, graft, bad government, are doomed.\" Melcher\nwatched with staring eyes while Hugo, with his free hand, rapidly\ndemolished the room. He picked up the great desk and smashed it, he tore\nthe stone mantelpiece from its roots; he kicked the fireplace apart; he\nburst a hole in the brick wall--dragging the bulk of a man behind him as\nhe moved. \"Remember that, Melcher. No one else on earth is like me--and\nI will get you if you fail to stop. I'll come for you if you squeal\nabout this--and I leave it to you to imagine what will happen.\"\n\nHugo walked into the hall. \"You're all done for--you cheap swindlers.\nAnd I am doom.\" The door banged.\n\nMelcher swayed on his feet, swallowed hard, and ran upstairs. \"Pack,\" he\nsaid to his valet.\n\nHe had gone; Hugo had removed the first of the public enemies. Yet Hugo\nwas not satisfied. His approach to Melcher had been dramatic,\nterrifying, effective. There were rumours of that violent morning. The\nrumours said that Melcher had been attacked, that he had been bought out\nfor bigger money, that something peculiar was occurring in Washington.\nIf ten, twenty men left and those rumours multiplied by geometrical\nprogression, sheer intimidation would work a vast good.\n\nBut other facts disconcerted Hugo. In the first place, his mind kept\nreverting to Melcher's words: \"Do you have the conceit to think that one\nperson can buck the will of millions?\" No matter how powerful that\nperson, his logic added. Millions of dollars or people? the same logic\nquestioned. After all, did it matter? People could be perjured by\nsubtler influences than gold. Secondly, the parley over arms continued\nto be an impasse despite the absence of Melcher. Perhaps, he argued, he\nhad not removed Melcher soon enough. A more carefully focused\nconsideration showed that, in spite of what Hatten had said. It was not\nindividuals against whom the struggle was made, but mass stupidity,\ngigantic bulwarks of human incertitude. And a new man came in Melcher's\nplace--a man who employed different tactics. Hugo could not exorcise the\nworld.\n\nA few days later Hugo learned that two radicals had been thrown into\njail on a charge of murder. The event had taken place in Newark, New\nJersey. A federal officer had attempted to break up a meeting. He had\nbeen shot. The men arrested were blamed, although it was evident that\nthey were chance seizures, that their proved guilt could be at most only\na social resentfulness. At first no one gave the story much attention.\nThe slow wheels of Jersey justice--printed always in quotation marks by\nthe dailies--began to turn. The men were summarily tried and convicted\nof murder in the first degree. A mob assaulted the jail where they were\nconfined--without success. Two of the mob were wounded by riot guns.\n\nA meeting was held in Berlin, one in London, another in Paris. Moscow\nwas silent, but Moscow was reported to be in an uproar. The trial\nassumed international proportions overnight. Embassies were stormed;\nlegations from America were forced to board cruisers. Strikes were\nordered; long queues of sullen men and women formed at camp kitchens.\nThe President delivered a message to Congress on the subject. Prominent\npersonages debated it in public halls, only to be acclaimed and booed\nconcomitantly. The sentence imposed on two Russian immigrants rocked the\nworld. In some cities it was not safe for American tourists to go abroad\nin the streets. And all the time the two men drew nearer to the electric\nchair.\n\nIt was then that Hugo met Skorvsky. Many people knew him; he was a\nradical, a writer; he lived in Washington, he styled himself an\nunofficial ambassador of the world. A small, dark man with a black\nmoustache who attended one of Hugo's informal afternoon discussions on a\nvicarious invitation. \"Come over and see Hugo Danner. He's something new\nin Washington.\"\n\n\"Something new in Washington? I shall omit the obvious sarcasm. I shall\ngo.\" Skorvsky went.\n\nHugo listened to him talk about the two prisoners. He was lucid; he\nmade allowances for the American democracy, which in themselves were\nburning criticism. Hugo asked him to dinner. They dined at Hugo's house.\n\n\"You have the French taste in wines,\" Skorvsky said, \"but, as it is to\nmy mind the finest taste in the world, I can say only that.\"\n\nHugo tried to lead him back to the topic that interested both of them so\nacutely. Skorvsky shrugged. \"You are polite--or else you are curious. I\nknow you--an American business man in Washington with a purpose. Not an\napparent purpose--just now. No, no. Just now you are a host, cultivated\nand genial, and retiring. But at the proper time--ah! A dam somewhere in\nArizona. A forest that you covet in Alaska. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"What if it is not?\"\n\nSkorvsky stared at the ceiling. \"What then? A secret? Yes, I thought\nthat about you while we were talking to the others to-day. There is\nsomething deep about you, my new friend. You are a power. Possibly you\nare not even really an American.\"\n\n\"That is wrong.\"\n\n\"You assure me that I am right. But I will agree with you. You are, let\nus say, the very epitome of the man Mr. Mencken and Mr. Lewis tell us\nabout so charmingly. I am Russian and I cannot know all of America. You\nmight divulge your errand, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Suppose I said it was to set the world aright?\"\n\nSkorvsky laughed lightly. \"Then I should throw myself at your feet.\"\n\nBoth men were in deadly earnest, Hugo not quite willing to adopt the\nRussian's almost effeminate delicacy, yet eager to talk to him, or to\nsomeone like him--someone who was more than a great self-centred wheel\nin the progress of the nation. Hugo yielded a little further. \"Yet that\nis my purpose. And I am not altogether impotent. There are things I can\ndo--\" He got up from the table and stretched himself with a feline\ngrace.\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of your two compatriots who were recently given such\nwretched justice. Suppose they were liberated by force. What then?\"\n\n\"Ah! You are an independent communist?\"\n\n\"Not even that. Just a friend of progress.\"\n\n\"So. A dreamer. One of the few who have wealth. And you have a plan to\nfree these men?\"\n\nHugo shrugged. \"I merely speculated on the possible outcome of such a\nthing; assume that they were snatched from prison and hidden beyond the\nlaw.\"\n\nSkorvsky meditated. \"It would be a great victory for the cause, of\ncourse. A splendid lift to its morale.\"\n\n\"The cause of Bolshevism?\"\n\n\"A higher and a different cause. I cannot explain it briefly. Perhaps I\ncannot explain it at all. But the old world of empires is crumbled.\nDemocracy is at its farcical height. The new world is not yet manifest.\nI shall be direct. What is your plan, Mr. Danner?\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you. Anyway, you would not believe it. But I could\nguarantee to deliver those two men anywhere in the country within a few\ndays without leaving a trace of how it was done. What do you think of\nthat, Skorvsky?\"\n\n\"I think you are a dangerous and a valuable man.\"\n\n\"Not many people do.\" Hugo's eyes were moody. \"I have been thinking\nabout it for a long time. Nothing that I can remember has happened\nduring my life that gives me a greater feeling of understanding than the\nimprisonment and sentencing of those men. I know poignantly the glances\nthat are given them, the stupidity of the police and the courts, the\nhorror-stricken attitude of those who condemn them without knowledge of\nthe truth or a desire for such knowledge.\" He buried his face in his\nhands and then looked up quickly. \"I know all that passionately and\nintensely. I know the blind fury to which it all gives birth. I hate it.\nI detest it. Selfishness, stupidity, malice. I know the fear it\nengenders--a dreadful and a justified fear. I've felt it. Very little in\nthis world avails against it. You'll forgive so much sentiment,\nSkorvsky?\"\n\n\"It makes us brothers.\" The Russian spoke with force and simplicity.\n\"You, too--\"\n\nHugo crossed the room restlessly. \"I don't know. I am always losing my\ngrip. I came to Washington with a purpose and I cannot screw myself to\nit unremittingly. These men seem--\"\n\nSkorvsky was thinking. \"Your plan for them. What assistance would you\nneed?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"None!\"\n\n\"Why should I need help? I--never mind. I need none.\"\n\n\"You have your own organization?\"\n\n\"There is no one but me.\"\n\nSkorvsky shook his head. \"I cannot--and yet--looking at you--I believe\nyou can. I shall tell you. You will come with me to-night and meet my\nfriends--those who are working earnestly for a new America, an America\nruled by intelligence alone. Few outsiders enter our councils. We are\nall--nearly all--foreigners. Yet we are more American than the Maine\nfisherman, the Minnesota farmer. Behind us is a party that grows apace.\nThis incident in New Jersey has added to it, as does every dense mumble\nof Congress, every scandalous metropolitan investigation. I shall\ntelephone.\"\n\nHugo allowed himself to be conducted half-dubiously. But what he found\nwas superficially, at least, what he had dreamed for himself. The house\nto which he was taken was pretentious; the people in its salon were\namiable and educated; there was no sign of the red flag, the ragged\nreformer, the anarchist. The women were gracious; the men witty. As he\ntalked to them, one by one, he began to believe that here was the\nnucleus around which he could construct his imaginary empire. He became\ninterested; he expanded.\n\nIt was late in the night when Skorvsky raised his voice slightly, so\nthat everyone would listen, and made an announcement: \"Friends, I have\nhad the honour to introduce Mr. Danner to you. Now I have the greater\nhonour of telling you his purpose and pledge. To-morrow night he will go\nto New Jersey\"--the silence became absolute--\"and two nights later he\nwill bring to us in person from their cells Davidoff and Pletzky.\"\n\nA quick, pregnant pause was followed by excitement. They took Hugo by\nthe hand, some of them applauded, one or two cheered, they shouldered\nnear him, they asked questions and expressed doubts. It was broad\ndaylight before they dispersed. Hugo walked to his house, listening to a\nlong rhapsody from Skorvsky.\n\n\"We will make you a great man if you succeed,\" Skorvsky said.\n\"Good-night, comrade.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\" Hugo went into the hall and up to his bedroom. He sat on\nhis bed. A dullness overcame him. He had never been patronized quite in\nthe same way as he had that night; it exerted at once a corrosive and a\nlethargic influence. He undressed slowly, dropping his shoes on the\nfloor. Splendid people they were, he thought. A smaller voice suggested\nto him that he did not really care to go to New Jersey for the\nprisoners. They would be hard to locate. There would be a sensation and\na mystery again. Still, he had found a purpose.\n\nHis telephone rang. He reached automatically from the bed. The room was\nbright with sunshine, which meant that it was late in the day. His brain\ntook reluctant hold on consciousness. \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hello? Danner, my friend--\"\n\n\"Oh, hello, Skorvsky--\"\n\n\"May I come up? It is important.\"\n\n\"Sure. I'm still in bed. But come on.\"\n\nHugo was under the shower bath when his visitor arrived. He invited\nSkorvsky to share his breakfast, but was impatiently refused. \"Things\nhave happened since last night, Comrade Danner. For one, I saw the\nchief.\"\n\n\"Chief?\"\n\n\"You have not met him as yet. We conferred about your scheme. He--I\nregret to say--opposed it.\"\n\nHugo nodded. \"I'm not surprised. I'll tell you what to do. You take me\nto him--and I'll prove conclusively that it will be successful. Then,\nperhaps, he will agree to sanction it. Every time I think of those two\npoor devils--snatched from a mob--waiting there in the dark for the\nelectric chair--it makes my blood boil.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" Skorvsky agreed. \"But you do not understand. It is not that he\ndoubts your ability--if you failed it would not be important. He fears\nyou might accomplish it. I assured him you would. I have faith in you.\"\n\n\"He's afraid I would do it? That doesn't make sense, Skorvsky.\"\n\n\"It does, I regret to say.\" His expressive face stirred with discomfort.\n\"We were too hasty, too precipitate. I see his reason now. We cannot\nafford as a group to be branded as jail-breakers.\"\n\n\"That's--weak,\" Hugo said.\n\nSkorvsky cleared his throat. \"There are other matters. Since Davidoff\nand Pletzky were jailed, the party has grown by leaps and bounds. Money\nhas poured in--\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Hugo said softly, \"money.\"\n\nSkorvsky raged. \"Go ahead. Be sarcastic. To free those men would cost us\na million dollars, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Too bad.\"\n\n\"With a million--the million their electrocution will bring from the\noutraged--we can accomplish more than saving two paltry lives. We must\nbe hard, we must think ahead.\"\n\n\"In thinking ahead, Skorvsky, do you not think of the closing of a\nswitch and the burning of human flesh?\"\n\n\"For every cause there must be martyrs. Their names will live\neternally.\"\n\n\"And they themselves--?\"\n\n\"Bah! You are impractical.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" Hugo ate a slice of toast with outward calm. \"I was hoping\nfor a government that--did not weigh people against dollars--\"\n\n\"Nor do we!\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\nSkorvsky leaped to his feet. \"Fool! Dreamer! Preposterous idealist! I\nmust be going.\"\n\nHugo sighed. \"Suppose I went ahead?\"\n\n\"One thing!\" The Russian turned with a livid face. \"One thing the chief\nbade me tell you. If those men escape--you die.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Hugo said. He stared through the window. \"And supposing I were to\noffer your chief a million--or nearly a million--for the privilege of\nfreeing them?\"\n\nSkorvsky's face returned to its look of transfiguration, the look that\nhad accompanied his noblest words of the night before. \"You would do\nthat, comrade?\" he whispered. \"You would give us--give the cause--a\nmillion? Never since the days of our Saviour has a man like you walked\non this--\"\n\nHugo stood up suddenly. \"Get out of here!\" His voice was a cosmic\nmenace. \"Get out of here, you dirty swine. Get out of here before I\nbreak you to matchwood, before I rip out your guts and stuff them back\nthrough your filthy, lying throat. Get out, oh, God, get out!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nHugo realized at last that there was no place in his world for him.\nTides and tempest, volcanoes and lightning, all other majestic\nvehemences of the universe had a purpose, but he had none. Either\nbecause he was all those forces unnaturally locked in the body of a man,\nor because he was a giant compelled to stoop and pander to live at all\namong his feeble fellows, his anachronism was complete.\n\nThat much he perceived calmly. His tragedy lay in the lie he had told to\nhis father: great deeds were always imminent and none of them could be\naccomplished because they involved humanity, humanity protecting its\ndiseases, its pettiness, its miserable convictions and conventions, with\nthe essence of itself--life. Life not misty and fecund for the future,\nbut life clawing at the dollar in the hour, the security of platitudes,\nthe relief of visible facts, the hope in rationalization, the needs of\nskin, belly, and womb.\n\nBeyond that, he could see destiny by interpreting his limited career.\nThrough a sort of ontogenetic recapitulation he had survived his savage\nchildhood, his barbaric youth, and the Greeces, Romes, Egypts, and\nBabylons of his early manhood, emerging into a present that was endowed\nwith as much aspiration and engaged with the same futility as was his\ncontemporary microcosm. No life span could observe anything but material\nprogress, for so mean and inalterable is the gauge of man that his races\ntopple before his soul expands, and the eventualities of his growth in\nspace and time must remain a problem for thousands and tens of thousands\nof years.\n\nSearching still further, he appreciated that no single man could force a\nchange upon his unwilling fellows. At most he might inculcate an idea in\na few and live to see its gradual spreading. Even then he could have no\nassurance of its contortions to the desire for wealth and power or of\nthe consequences of those contortions.\n\nFinally, to build, one must first destroy, and he questioned his right\nto select unaided the objects for destruction. He looked at the Capitol\nin Washington and pondered the effect of issuing an ultimatum and\nthereafter bringing down the great dome like Samson. He thought of the\nchurches and their bewildering, stupefying effect on masses who were\nmulcted by their own fellows, equally bewildered, equally stupefied.\nSuppose through a thousand nights he ravaged the churches, wrecking\nevery structure in the land, laying waste property, making the loud,\nunattended volume of worship an impossibility, taking away the\npurple-robed gods of his forbears? Suppose he sank the navy, annihilated\nthe army, set up a despotism? No matter how efficiently and well he\nruled, the millions would hate him, plot against him, attempt his life;\nand every essential agent would be a hypocritical sycophant seeking\nselfish ends.\n\nHe reached the last of his conclusions sitting beside a river whither he\nhad walked to think. An immense loathing for the world rose up in him.\nAt its apex a locomotive whistled in the distance, thundered\ninarticulately, and rounded a bend. It came very near the place where\nHugo reclined, black, smoking, and noisy, drivers churning along the\nrails, a train of passenger cars behind. Hugo could see the dots that\nwere people's heads. People! Human beings! How he hated them! The train\nwas very near. Suddenly all his muscles were unsprung. He threw himself\nto his feet and rushed toward the train, with a passionate desire to get\nhis fingers around the sliding piston, to up-end the locomotive and to\nthrow the ordered machinery into a blackened, blazing, bloody tangle of\nruin.\n\nHis lips uttered a wild cry; he jumped across the river and ran two\nprodigious steps. Then he stopped. The train went on unharmed. Hugo\nshuddered.\n\nIf the world did not want him, he would leave the world. Perhaps he was\na menace to it. Perhaps he should kill himself. But his burning,\nsickened heart refused once more to give up. Frenzy departed, then\nnumbness. In its place came a fresh hope, new determination. Hugo Danner\nwould do his utmost until the end. Meanwhile, he would remove himself\nsome distance from the civilization that had tortured him. He would go\naway and find a new dream.\n\nThe sound of the locomotive was dead in the distance. He crossed the\nriver on a bridge and went back to his house. He felt strong again and\nglad--glad because he had won an obscure victory, glad because the farce\nof his quest in political government had ended with no tragic\nd\u00e9nouement.\n\nThey were electrocuting Davidoff and Pletzky that day. The news scarcely\ninterested Hugo. The part he had very nearly played in the affair seemed\nlike the folly of a dimly remembered acquaintance. The relief of\nresigning that impossible purpose overwhelmed him. He dismissed his\nservants, closed his house, and boarded a train. When the locomotive\npounded through the station, he suffered a momentary pang. He sat in a\nseat with people all around him. He was tranquil and almost content.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nHugo had no friends. One single individual whom he loved, whom he could\nhave taken fully into his confidence, might, in a measure, have resolved\nhis whole life. Yet so intense was the pressure that had conditioned him\nthat he invariably retreated before the rare opportunities for such\nconfidences. He had known many persons well: his father and mother, Anna\nBlake, Lefty Foresman, Charlotte, Iris, Tom Shayne, Roseanne, even\nSkorvsky--but none of them had known him. His friendlessness was\nresponsible for a melancholy yearning to remain with his kind. Having\nalready determined to go away, he sought for a kind of compromise.\n\nHe did not want to be in New York, or Washington, or any other city; the\nlandscape of America was haunted for him. He would leave it, but he\nwould not open himself to the cruel longing for his own language, the\nsight of familiar customs and manners. From his hotel in New York he\nmade excursions to various steamship agencies and travel bureaus. He\nhad seen many lands, and his _Wanderlust_ demanded novelty. For days he\nwas undecided.\n\nIt was a chance group of photographs in a Sunday newspaper that excited\nhis first real interest. One of the pictures was of a man--erect,\nwhite-haired, tanned, clear-eyed--Professor Daniel Hardin--a procession\nof letters--head of the new expedition to Yucatan. The other pictures\nwere of ruined temples, unpiled stone causeways, jungle. He thought\ninstantly that he would like to attach himself to the party.\n\nMany factors combined to make the withdrawal offered by an expedition\nideal. The more Hugo thought about it, the more excited he became. The\nvery nascency of a fresh objective was accompanied by and crowded with\nnew hints for himself and his problems. The expedition would take him\naway from his tribulations, and it would not entirely cut him off from\nhis kind: Professor Hardin had both the face and the fame of a\ndistinguished man.\n\nA thought that had been in the archives of his mind for many months came\nsharply into relief: of all human beings alive, the scientists were the\nonly ones who retained imagination, ideals, and a sincere interest in\nthe larger world. It was to them he should give his allegiance, not to\nthe statesmen, not to industry or commerce or war. Hugo felt that in one\nquick glimpse he had made a long step forward.\n\nAnother concept, far more fantastic and in a way even more intriguing,\ndawned in his mind as he read accounts of the Maya ruins which were to\nbe excavated. The world was cluttered with these great lumps of\nincredible architecture. Walls had been builded by primitive man,\ntemples, hanging gardens, obelisks, pyramids, palaces, bridges,\nterraces, roads--all of them gigantic and all of them defying the\npenetration of arch\u00e6ology to find the manner of their creation. Was it\nnot possible--Hugo's heart skipped a beat when it occurred to him--that\nin their strange combination of ignorance and brilliance the ancients\nhad stumbled upon the secret of human strength--his secret! Had not\nthose antique and migratory peoples carried with them the formula which\ncould be poured into the veins of slaves, making them stronger than\nengines? And was it not conceivable that, as their civilizations\ncrumbled, the secret was lost, together with so many other formul\u00e6 of\nknowledge?\n\nHe could imagine plumed and painted priests with prayer and sacrifice\ncutting open the veins of prehistoric mothers and pouring in the magic\npotion. When the babies grew, they could raise up the pyramids, walls,\nand temples; they could do it rapidly and easily. A great enigma was\nthus resolved. He set out immediately to locate Professor Hardin and\nwith difficulty arranged an interview with him.\n\nPreparations for the expedition were being carried on in an ordinary New\nYork business office. A secretary announced Hugo and he was conducted\nbefore the professor. Daniel Hardin was no dusty pedagogue. His\nknowledge was profound and academic, his books were authoritative, but\nin himself he belonged to the type of man certain to succeed, whatever\nhis choice of occupation. Much of his life had been spent in field\nwork--arduous toil in bizarre lands where life depended sometimes on\ntact and sometimes on military strategy. He appraised Hugo shrewdly\nbefore he spoke.\n\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Danner?\"\n\nHugo came directly to the point. \"I should like to join your Yucatan\nexpedition.\"\n\nProfessor Hardin smiled. \"I'm sorry. We're full up.\"\n\n\"I'd be glad to go in any capacity--\"\n\n\"Have you special qualifications? Knowledge of the language? Of\narch\u00e6ology?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe professor picked up a tray of letters. \"These letters--more than\nthree hundred--are all from young men--and women--who would like to join\nmy expedition.\"\n\n\"I think I should be useful,\" Hugo said, and then he played his trump,\n\"and I should be willing to contribute, for the favour of being\nincluded, a sum of fifty thousand dollars.\"\n\nProfessor Hardin whistled. Then his eyes narrowed. \"What's your object,\nyoung man? Treasure?\"\n\n\"No. A life--let us say--with ample means at my disposal and no definite\npurpose.\"\n\n\"Boredom, then.\" He smiled. \"A lot of these other young men are\nindependently wealthy, and bored. I must say, I feel sorry for your\ngeneration. But--no--I can't accept. We are already adequately\nfinanced.\"\n\nHugo smiled in response. \"Then--perhaps--I could organize my own party\nand camp near you.\"\n\n\"That would hamper me.\"\n\n\"Then--a hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Good Lord. You are determined.\"\n\n\"I have decided. I am familiar with the jungle. I am an athlete. I speak\na little Spanish--enough to boss a labour gang. I propose to assist you\nin that way, as well as financially. I will make any contract with you\nthat you desire--and attach no strings whatever to my money.\"\n\nProfessor Hardin pondered for a long time. His eyes twinkled when he\nreplied. \"You won't believe it, but I don't give a damn for your money.\nNot that it wouldn't assist us. But--the fact is--I could use a man like\nyou. Anybody could. I'll take you--and you can keep your money.\"\n\n\"There will be a check in the mail to-morrow,\" Hugo answered.\n\nThe professor stood. \"We're hoping to get away in three weeks. You'll\nleave your address with my secretary and I'll send a list of the things\nyou'll want for your kit.\" He held out his hand and Hugo shook it. When\nhe had gone, the professor looked over the roof-tops and swore gleefully\nto himself.\n\nHugo discovered, after the ship sailed, that everyone called Professor\nHardin \"Dan\" and they used Hugo's first name from the second day out.\nDan Hardin was too busy to be very friendly with any of the members of\nhis party during the voyage, but they themselves fraternized\ncontinually. There were deck games and card games; there were long and\nerudite arguments about the people whom they were going to study. What\nwas the Mayan time cycle and did it correspond to the Egyptian Sothic\ncycle or the Greek Metonic cycle. Where did the Mayans get their jade?\nDid they come from Asia over Bering Strait or were they a colony of\nAtlantis? When they knew so much about engineering, why did they not use\nthe keystone arch and the wheel? Why was their civilization decadent,\nfinished when the _conquistadores_ discovered it? How old were\nthey--four thousand years or twelve thousand years? There were\ninnumerable other debates to which Hugo listened like a man new-born.\n\nThe cold Atlantic winds were transformed overnight to the balm of the\nGulf stream. Presently they passed the West Indies, which lay on the\nwater like marine jewels. Ages turned back through the days of\nbuccaneering to the more remote times. In the port of Xantl a rickety\nwharf, a single white man, a zinc bar, and a storehouse filled with\nchicle blocks marked off the realm of the twentieth century. The ship\nanchored. During the next year it would make two voyages back to the\nhomeland for supplies. But the explorers would not emerge from the\njungle in that time.\n\nAn antiquated, wood-burning locomotive, which rocked along over\ntreacherous rails, carried them inland. The scientists became silent and\npensive. In another car the Maya Indians who were to do the manual\nlabour chattered incessantly in their explosive tongue. At the last\nsun-baked stop they disembarked, slept through an insect-droning night,\nand entered the jungle. For three weeks they hacked and hewed their way\nforward; the vegetation closed behind them, cutting off the universe as\ncompletely as the submerging waves of the sea. It was hot, difficult\nwork, to which Hugo lent himself with an energy that astounded even\nHardin, who had judged him valuable.\n\nOne day, when the high mountains loomed into view, Hugo caught his first\nglimpse of Uctotol, the Sacred City. A creeper on the hillside fell\nbefore his machete, then another--a hole in the green wall--and there it\nstood, shining white, huge, desolate, still as the grave. His arm hung\nin mid-air. Over him passed the mystic feeling of familiarity, that\nfugitive sense of recognition which springs so readily into a belief in\nimmortality. It seemed to him during that staggering instant that he\nknew every contour of those great structures, that he had run in the\nstreets, lived, loved, died there--that he could almost remember the\nnames and faces of its inhabitants, dead for thousands of years--that he\ncould nearly recall the language and the music--that destiny itself had\narranged a home-coming. The vision died. He gave a great shout. The\nothers rushed to his side and found him trembling and pointing.\n\nTons of verdure were cut down and pushed aside. A hacienda was\nconstructed and a camp for the labourers. Then the shovels and picks\nwere broken from their boxes; the scientists arranged their\nparaphernalia, and the work began, interrupted frequently by the\nexultant shouts that marked a new finding. No one regretted Hugo. He\nmade his men work magically; his example was a challenge. He could do\nmore than any of them, and his hair and eyes, black as their own, his\ngranite face, stern and indefatigable, gave him a natural dominion over\nthem.\n\nAll this--the dark, starlit, plushy nights with their hypnotic silences,\nthe vivid days of toil, the patient and single-minded men--was respite\nto Hugo. It salved his tribulations. It brought him to a gradual\nassurance that any work with such men would be sufficient for him. He\nwas going backward into the world instead of forward; that did not\nmatter. He stood on the frontier of human knowledge. He was a factor in\nits preparation, and if what they carried back with them was no more\nthan history, if it cast no new light on existing wants and\nperplexities, it still served a splendid purpose. Months rolled by\nunheeded; Hugo gathered friends among these men--and the greatest of\nthose friends was Daniel Hardin.\n\nIn their isolation and occasional loneliness each of them little by\nlittle stripped his past for the others. Only Hugo remained silent about\nhimself until his reticence was conspicuous. He might never have spoken,\nexcept for the accident.\n\nIt was, in itself, a little thing, which happened apart from the main\nfield of activity. Hugo and two Indians were at work on a small temple\nat the city's fringe. Hardin came down to see. The great stone in the\nroof, crumbled by ages, slipped and teetered. Underneath the professor\nstood, unheeding. But Hugo saw. He caught the mass of rock in his arms\nand lifted it to one side. And Dan Hardin turned in time to perceive the\nfull miracle.\n\nWhen Hugo lifted his head, he knew. Yet, to his astonishment, there was\nno look of fear in Hardin's blue eyes. Instead, they were moderately\nsurprised, vastly interested. He did not speak for some time. Then he\nsaid: \"Thanks, Danner. I believe you saved my life. Should you mind\npicking up that rock again?\"\n\nHugo dismissed the Indians with a few words. He glanced again at Hardin\nto make sure of his composure. Then he lifted the square stone back to\nits position.\n\nHardin was thinking aloud. \"That stone must weigh four tons. No man\nalive can handle four tons like that. How do you do it, Hugo?\"\n\nHot, streaming sun. Tumbled d\u00e9bris. This profound question asked again,\nasked mildly for the first time. \"My father--was a biologist. A great\nbiologist. I was--an experiment.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! And--and that's why you've kept your past dark, Hugo?\"\n\n\"Of course. Not many people--\"\n\n\"Survive the shock? You forget that we--here--are all scientists. I\nwon't press you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Hugo heard himself saying, \"I'd like to tell you.\"\n\n\"In that case--in my room--to-night. I should like to hear.\"\n\nThat night, after a day of indecision, Hugo sat in a dim light and\npoured out the story of his life. Hardin never interrupted, never\ncommented, until the end. Then he said softly: \"You poor devil. Oh, you\npoor bastard.\" And Hugo saw that he was weeping. He tried to laugh.\n\n\"It isn't as bad as that--Dan.\"\n\n\"Son\"--his voice choked with emotion--\"this thing--this is my life-work.\nThis is why you came to my office last winter. This is--the most\nimportant thing on earth. What a story! What a man you are!\"\n\n\"On the contrary--\"\n\n\"Don't be modest. I know. I feel. I understand.\"\n\nHugo's head shook sadly. \"Perhaps not. You can see--I have tried\neverything. In itself, it is great. I can see that. It is, objectively,\nthe most important thing on earth. But the other way--What can I do?\nTell me that. You cannot tell me. I can destroy. As nothing that ever\ncame before or will come again, I can destroy. But destruction--as I\nbelieve, as you believe--is at best only a step toward re-creation. And\nwhat can I make afterwards? Think. Think, man! Rack your brains! What?\"\nHis hands clenched and unclenched. \"I can build great halls and palaces.\nFutile! I can make bridges. I can rip open mountains and take out the\ngold. I am that strong. It is as if my metabolism was atomic instead of\nmolecular. But what of it? Stretch your imagination to its uttermost\nlimits--and what can I do that is more than an affair of petty profit to\nmyself? Mankind has already extended its senses and its muscles to their\ntenth powers. He can already command engines to do what I can do. It is\nnot necessary that he become an engine himself. It is preposterous that\nhe should think of it--even to transcend his engines. I defy you, I defy\nyou with all my strength, to think of what I can do to justify myself!\"\n\nThe words had been wrung from Hugo. Perspiration trickled down his face.\nHe bit his lips to check himself. The older man was grave. \"All your\nemotions, your reflections, your yearnings and passions, come--to that.\nAnd yet--\"\n\n\"Look at me in another light,\" Hugo went on. \"I've tried to give you an\ninkling of it. You were the first who saw what I could do--glimpsed a\nfraction of it, rather--and into whose face did not come fear, loathing,\neven hate. Try to live with a sense of that. I can remember almost back\nto the cradle that same thing. First it was envy and jealousy. Then, as\nI grew stronger, it was fear, alarm, and the thing that comes from\nfear--hatred. That is another and perhaps a greater obstacle. If I found\nsomething to do, the whole universe would be against me. These little\npeople! Can you imagine what it is to be me and to look at people? A\ncrowd at a ball game? A parade? Can you?\"\n\n\"Great God,\" the scientist breathed.\n\n\"When I see them for what they are, and when they exert the tremendous\nbulk of their united detestation and denial against me, when I feel rage\nrising inside myself--can you conceive--?\"\n\n\"That's enough. I don't want to try to think. Not of that. I--\"\n\n\"Shall I walk to my grave afraid that I shall let go of myself,\nsearching everywhere for something to absorb my energy? Shall I?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe professor spoke with a firm concentration. Hugo arrested himself.\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"Did it ever dawn on you that you had missed your purpose entirely?\"\n\nThe words were like cold water to Hugo. He pulled himself together with\na physical effort and replied: \"You mean--that I have not guessed it so\nfar?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"It never occurred to me. Not that I had missed it entirely.\"\n\n\"You have.\"\n\n\"Then, for the love of God, what is it?\"\n\nHardin smiled a gentle, wise smile. \"Easy there. I'll tell you. And\nlisten well, Hugo, because to-night I feel inspired. The reason you have\nmissed it is simple. You've tried to do everything single-handed--\"\n\n\"On the contrary. Every kind of assistance I have enlisted has failed me\nutterly.\"\n\n\"Except one kind.\"\n\n\"Science?\"\n\n\"No. Your own kind, Hugo.\"\n\nThe words did not convey their meaning for several seconds. Then Hugo\ngasped. \"You mean--other men like me?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Other men like you. Not one or two. Scores, hundreds. And\nwomen. All picked with the utmost care. Eugenic offspring. Cultivated\nand reared in secret by a society for the purpose. Not necessarily your\nchildren, but the children of the best parents. Perfect bodies,\nintellectual minds, your strength. Don't you see it, Hugo? You are not\nthe reformer of the old world. You are the beginning of the new. We\nbegin with a thousand of you. Living by yourselves and multiplying, you\nproduce your own arts and industries and ideals. The new Titans!\nThen--slowly--you dominate the world. Conquer and stamp out all these\nthings to which you and I and all men of intelligence object. In the\nend--you are alone and supreme.\"\n\nHugo groaned. \"To make a thousand men live my life--\"\n\n\"But they will not. Suppose you had been proud of your strength. Suppose\nyou had not been compelled to keep it a secret. Suppose you could have\nfound glorious uses for it from childhood--\"\n\n\"In the mountains,\" Hugo whispered, his eyes bemused, \"where the sun is\nwarm and the days long--these children growing. Even here, in this\nplace--\"\n\n\"So I thought. Don't you see, Hugo?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see. At last, thank God, I do see!\"\n\nFor a long time their thoughts ran wild. When they cooled, it was to\nformulate plans. A child taken here. Another there. A city in the\njungle--the jungle had harboured races before: not only these Mayas, but\nthe Incas, Khmers, and others. A modern city for dwellings, and these\ntremendous ruins would be the blocks for the nursery. They would teach\nthem art and architecture--and science. Engineering, medicine--their\nown, undiscovered medicine--the new Titans, the sons of dawn--so ran\ntheir inspired imaginations.\n\nWhen the night was far advanced and the camp was wrapped in slumber,\nthey made a truce with this divine fire. They shook each other's hands.\n\n\"Good-night, Hugo. And to-morrow we'll go over the notes.\"\n\n\"I'll bring them.\"\n\n\"Till evening, then.\"\n\nHugo lay on his bed, more ecstatic than he had ever been in his life. By\nand by he slept. Then, as if the ghosts of Uctotol had risen, his mind\nwas troubled by a host, a pageant of dreams. He turned in his sleep,\nrending his blankets. He moaned and mumbled. When he woke, he understood\nthat his soul had undergone another of its diametric inversions. The mad\nfancies of the night before had died and memory could not rekindle them.\nLittle dreads had goaded away their brightness. Conscience was bickering\ninside him. Humanity was content; it would hate his new race. And the\nnew race, being itself human, might grow top-heavy with power. If his\ntheory about the great builders of the past was true, then perhaps this\nincubus would explain why the past was no more. If his Titans disagreed\nand made war on each other--surely that would end the earth. He quailed.\n\nOvercome by a desire to think more about this giants' scheme, he avoided\nHardin. In the siesta hour he went back to his tent and procured the\nbooks wherein his father had written the second secret of life. He\ncrammed them into his pocket and broke through the jungle. When he was\nbeyond sight and sound, he dropped his machete and made his way as none\nbut he could do. With his body he cut a swath toward the mountains and\nemerged from the green veil on to the bare rocks, panting and hot.\nUpward he climbed until he had gained the summit. To the west were\nstrewn the frozen billows of the range. To the east a limitless sea of\nverdure. At his feet the ruins in neat miniature, like a model. Above,\nscalding sun and blue sky. Around him a wind, strangely chill. And\nsilence.\n\nHe sat with his head on his hands until his thoughts were disturbed. A\nhumid breath had risen sluggishly from the jungle floor. The sun was\ndull. Looking toward the horizon, he could see a black cloud. For an\ninstant he was frightened, the transformation had been so gigantic and\nso soundless. He knew a sudden, urgent impulse to go back to the valley.\nHe disobeyed it and watched the coming of the storm. The first rapier of\nlightning through the bowels of the approaching cloud warned him again.\nStaunchly he stood. He had come there to think.\n\n\"I must go back and begin this work,\" he told himself. \"I have found a\nfriend!\" The cloud was descending. Thunder ruminated in heaven's garret.\n\"It is folly,\" he repeated, \"folly, folly, folly in the face of God.\"\nNow the sun went out like an extinguished lamp, and the horizon crept\ncloser. A curtain of torrential rain was lowered in the north. \"They\nwill make the earth beautiful,\" he said, and ever and again: \"This thing\nis not beautiful. It is wrong.\" His agitation increased rapidly. The\ncloud was closing on the mountain like a huge hand. The muscles in his\nlegs quivered.\n\n\"If there were only a God,\" he whispered, \"what a prayer I would make!\"\nThen the wind came like a visible thing, pushing its fingers over the\nvegetation below, and whirling up the mountain, laden with dust. After\nthe wind, the rain--heavy, roaring rain that fell, not in separate\ndrops, but in thick streams. The lightning was incessant. It illuminated\nremote, white-topped peaks, which, in the fury of the storm, appeared to\nbe swaying. It split clouds apart, and the hurricane healed the rents.\nAll light went out. The world was wrapped in darkness.\n\nHugo clutched his precious books in the remnants of his clothing and\nbraced himself on the bare rock. His voice roared back into the storm\nthe sounds it gave. He flung one hand upward.\n\n\"Now--God--oh, God--if there be a God--tell me! Can I defy You? Can I\ndefy Your world? Is this Your will? Or are You, like all mankind,\nimpotent? Oh, God!\" He put his hand to his mouth and called God like a\nname into the tumult above. Madness was upon him and the bitter irony\nwith which his blood ran black was within him.\n\nA bolt of lightning stabbed earthward. It struck Hugo, outlining him in\nfire. His hand slipped away from his mouth. His voice was quenched. He\nfell to the ground.\n\nAfter three days of frantic searching, Daniel Hardin came upon the\nincredible passage through the jungle and followed it to the mountain\ntop. There he found the blackened body of Hugo Danner, lying face down.\nHis clothing was burned to ashes, and an accumulation of cinders was\nall that remained of the notebooks. After discovering that, Professor\nHardin could not forbear to glance aloft at the sun and sky. His face\nwas saddened and perplexed.\n\n\"We will carry him yonder to Uctotol and bury him,\" he said at last;\n\"then--the work will go on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Gladiator, by Philip Wylie\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GLADIATOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 42914-8.txt or 42914-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/9/1/42914/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
