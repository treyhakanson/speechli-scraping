Then another. Alan stopped,\npuzzled. Two more blasts, quickly together, and the sound of a scream\nfaintly.\n\nFrowning, worrying about the sounds, Alan momentarily forgot to watch\nhis step until his foot suddenly plunged into an ant hill, throwing him\nto the jungle floor. \"Damn!\" He cursed again, for the tenth time, and\nstood uncertainly in the dimness. From tall, moss-shrouded trees,\nwrist-thick vines hung quietly, scraping the spongy ground like the\ntentacles of some monstrous tree-bound octopus. Fitful little plants\ngrew straggly in the shadows of the mossy trunks, forming a dense\nunderbrush that made walking difficult. At midday some few of the blue\nsun's rays filtered through to the jungle floor, but now, late afternoon\non the planet, the shadows were long and gloomy.\n\nAlan peered around him at the vine-draped shadows, listening to the soft\nrustlings and faint twig-snappings of life in the jungle. Two short,\npopping sounds echoed across the stillness, drowned out almost\nimmediately and silenced by an explosive crash. Alan started, \"Blaster\nfighting! But it can't be!\"\n\nSuddenly anxious, he slashed a hurried X in one of the trees to mark his\nposition then turned to follow a line of similar marks back through the\njungle. He tried to run, but vines blocked his way and woody shrubs\ncaught at his legs, tripping him and holding him back. Then, through\nthe trees he saw the clearing of the camp site, the temporary home for\nthe scout ship and the eleven men who, with Alan, were the only humans\non the jungle planet, Waiamea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStepping through the low shrubbery at the edge of the site, he looked\nacross the open area to the two temporary structures, the camp\nheadquarters where the power supplies and the computer were; and the\nsleeping quarters. Beyond, nose high, stood the silver scout ship that\nhad brought the advance exploratory party of scientists and technicians\nto Waiamea three days before. Except for a few of the killer robots\nrolling slowly around the camp site on their quiet treads, there was no\none about.\n\n\"So, they've finally got those things working.\" Alan smiled slightly.\n\"Guess that means I owe Pete a bourbon-and-soda for sure. Anybody who\ncan build a robot that hunts by homing in on animals' mind impulses ...\"\nHe stepped forward just as a roar of blue flame dissolved the branches\nof a tree, barely above his head.\n\nWithout pausing to think, Alan leaped back, and fell sprawling over a\nbush just as one of the robots rolled silently up from the right,\nlowering its blaster barrel to aim directly at his head. Alan froze. \"My\nGod, Pete built those things wrong!\"\n\nSuddenly a screeching whirlwind of claws and teeth hurled itself from\nthe smoldering branches and crashed against the robot, clawing insanely\nat the antenna and blaster barrel. With an awkward jerk the robot swung\naround and fired its blaster, completely dissolving the lower half of\nthe cat creature which had clung across the barrel. But the back\npressure of the cat's body overloaded the discharge circuits. The robot\nstarted to shake, then clicked sharply as an overload relay snapped and\nshorted the blaster cells. The killer turned and rolled back towards the\ncamp, leaving Alan alone.\n\nShakily, Alan crawled a few feet back into the undergrowth where he\ncould lie and watch the camp, but not himself be seen. Though visibility\ndidn't make any difference to the robots, he felt safer, somehow,\nhidden. He knew now what the shooting sounds had been and why there\nhadn't been anyone around the camp site. A charred blob lying in the\ngrass of the clearing confirmed his hypothesis. His stomach felt sick.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he muttered to himself, \"that Pete assembled these robots\nin a batch and then activated them all at once, probably never living to\nrealize that they're tuned to pick up human brain waves, too. Damn!\nDamn!\" His eyes blurred and he slammed his fist into the soft earth.\n\nWhen he raised his eyes again the jungle was perceptibly darker.\nStealthy rustlings in the shadows grew louder with the setting sun.\nBranches snapped unaccountably in the trees overhead and every now and\nthen leaves or a twig fell softly to the ground, close to where he lay.\nReaching into his jacket, Alan fingered his pocket blaster. He pulled it\nout and held it in his right hand. \"This pop gun wouldn't even singe a\nrobot, but it just might stop one of those pumas.\"\n\n[Illustration: They said the blast with your name on it would find you\nanywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.]\n\nSlowly Alan looked around, sizing up his situation. Behind him the dark\njungle rustled forbiddingly. He shuddered. \"Not a very healthy spot to\nspend the night. On the other hand, I certainly can't get to the camp\nwith a pack of mind-activated mechanical killers running around. If I\ncan just hold out until morning, when the big ship arrives ... The big\nship! Good Lord, Peggy!\" He turned white; oily sweat punctuated his\nforehead. Peggy, arriving tomorrow with the other colonists, the wives\nand kids! The metal killers, tuned to blast any living flesh, would\nmurder them the instant they stepped from the ship!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA pretty girl, Peggy, the girl he'd married just three weeks ago. He\nstill couldn't believe it. It was crazy, he supposed, to marry a girl\nand then take off for an unknown planet, with her to follow, to try to\ncreate a home in a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe, but Peggy and her green\neyes that changed color with the light, with her soft brown hair, and\nher happy smile, had ended thirty years of loneliness and had, at last,\ngiven him a reason for living. \"Not to be killed!\" Alan unclenched his\nfists and wiped his palms, bloody where his fingernails had dug into the\nflesh.\n\nThere was a slight creak above him like the protesting of a branch too\nheavily laden. Blaster ready, Alan rolled over onto his back. In the\nmovement, his elbow struck the top of a small earthy mound and he was\ninstantly engulfed in a swarm of locust-like insects that beat\ndisgustingly against his eyes and mouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his arms before\nhis face he jumped up and backwards, away from the bugs. As he did so, a\ndark shapeless thing plopped from the trees onto the spot where he had\nbeen lying stretched out. Then, like an ambient fungus, it slithered off\ninto the jungle undergrowth.\n\nFor a split second the jungle stood frozen in a brilliant blue flash,\nfollowed by the sharp report of a blaster. Then another. Alan whirled,\nstartled. The planet's double moon had risen and he could see a robot\nrolling slowly across the clearing in his general direction, blasting\nindiscriminately at whatever mind impulses came within its pickup range,\nbirds, insects, anything. Six or seven others also left the camp\nheadquarters area and headed for the jungle, each to a slightly\ndifferent spot.\n\nApparently the robot hadn't sensed him yet, but Alan didn't know what\nthe effective range of its pickup devices was. He began to slide back\ninto the jungle. Minutes later, looking back he saw that the machine,\nthough several hundred yards away, had altered its course and was now\nheaded directly for him.\n\nHis stomach tightened. Panic. The dank, musty smell of the jungle seemed\nfor an instant to thicken and choke in his throat. Then he thought of\nthe big ship landing in the morning, settling down slowly after a lonely\ntwo-week voyage. He thought of a brown-haired girl crowding with the\nothers to the gangway, eager to embrace the new planet, and the next\ninstant a charred nothing, unrecognizable, the victim of a design error\nor a misplaced wire in a machine. \"I have to try,\" he said aloud. \"I\nhave to try.\" He moved into the blackness.\n\nPowerful as a small tank, the killer robot was equipped to crush, slash,\nand burn its way through undergrowth. Nevertheless, it was slowed by the\nlarger trees and the thick, clinging vines, and Alan found that he could\nmanage to keep ahead of it, barely out of blaster range. Only, the robot\ndidn't get tired. Alan did.\n\nThe twin moons cast pale, deceptive shadows that wavered and danced\nacross the jungle floor, hiding debris that tripped him and often sent\nhim sprawling into the dark. Sharp-edged growths tore at his face and\nclothes, and insects attracted by the blood matted against his pants and\nshirt. Behind, the robot crashed imperturbably after him, lighting the\nnight with fitful blaster flashes as some winged or legged life came\nwithin its range.\n\nThere was movement also, in the darkness beside him, scrapings and\nrustlings and an occasional low, throaty sound like an angry cat. Alan's\nfingers tensed on his pocket blaster. Swift shadowy forms moved quickly\nin the shrubs and the growling became suddenly louder. He fired twice,\nblindly, into the undergrowth. Sharp screams punctuated the electric\nblue discharge as a pack of small feline creatures leaped snarling and\nclawing back into the night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMentally, Alan tried to figure the charge remaining in his blaster.\nThere wouldn't be much. \"Enough for a few more shots, maybe. Why the\ndevil didn't I load in fresh cells this morning!\"\n\nThe robot crashed on, louder now, gaining on the tired human. Legs\naching and bruised, stinging from insect bites, Alan tried to force\nhimself to run holding his hands in front of him like a child in the\ndark. His foot tripped on a barely visible insect hill and a winged\nswarm exploded around him. Startled, Alan jerked sideways, crashing his\nhead against a tree. He clutched at the bark for a second, dazed, then\nhis knees buckled. His blaster fell into the shadows.\n\nThe robot crashed loudly behind him now. Without stopping to think, Alan\nfumbled along the ground after his gun, straining his eyes in the\ndarkness. He found it just a couple of feet to one side, against the\nbase of a small bush. Just as his fingers closed upon the barrel his\nother hand slipped into something sticky that splashed over his forearm.\nHe screamed in pain and leaped back, trying frantically to wipe the\nclinging, burning blackness off his arm. Patches of black scraped off\nonto branches and vines, but the rest spread slowly over his arm as\nagonizing as hot acid, or as flesh being ripped away layer by layer.\n\nAlmost blinded by pain, whimpering, Alan stumbled forward. Sharp muscle\nspasms shot from his shoulder across his back and chest. Tears streamed\nacross his cheeks.\n\nA blue arc slashed at the trees a mere hundred yards behind. He screamed\nat the blast. \"Damn you, Pete! Damn your robots! Damn, damn ... Oh,\nPeggy!\" He stepped into emptiness.\n\nCoolness. Wet. Slowly, washed by the water, the pain began to fall away.\nHe wanted to lie there forever in the dark, cool, wetness. For ever, and\never, and ... The air thundered.\n\nIn the dim light he could see the banks of the stream, higher than a\nman, muddy and loose. Growing right to the edge of the banks, the jungle\nreached out with hairy, disjointed arms as if to snag even the dirty\nlittle stream that passed so timidly through its domain.\n\nAlan, lying in the mud of the stream bed, felt the earth shake as the\nheavy little robot rolled slowly and inexorably towards him. \"The Lord\nHigh Executioner,\" he thought, \"in battle dress.\" He tried to stand but\nhis legs were almost too weak and his arm felt numb. \"I'll drown him,\"\nhe said aloud. \"I'll drown the Lord High Executioner.\" He laughed. Then\nhis mind cleared. He remembered where he was.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlan trembled. For the first time in his life he understood what it was\nto live, because for the first time he realized that he would sometime\ndie. In other times and circumstances he might put it off for a while,\nfor months or years, but eventually, as now, he would have to watch,\nstill and helpless, while death came creeping. Then, at thirty, Alan\nbecame a man.\n\n\"Dammit, no law says I have to flame-out _now_!\" He forced himself to\nrise, forced his legs to stand, struggling painfully in the shin-deep\nooze. He worked his way to the bank and began to dig frenziedly, chest\nhigh, about two feet below the edge.\n\nHis arm where the black thing had been was swollen and tender, but he\nforced his hands to dig, dig, dig, cursing and crying to hide the pain,\nand biting his lips, ignoring the salty taste of blood. The soft earth\ncrumbled under his hands until he had a small cave about three feet deep\nin the bank. Beyond that the soil was held too tightly by the roots from\nabove and he had to stop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe air crackled blue and a tree crashed heavily past Alan into the\nstream. Above him on the bank, silhouetting against the moons, the\nkiller robot stopped and its blaster swivelled slowly down. Frantically,\nAlan hugged the bank as a shaft of pure electricity arced over him,\nsliced into the water, and exploded in a cloud of steam. The robot shook\nfor a second, its blaster muzzle lifted erratically and for an instant\nit seemed almost out of control, then it quieted and the muzzle again\npointed down.\n\nPressing with all his might, Alan slid slowly along the bank inches at a\ntime, away from the machine above. Its muzzle turned to follow him but\nthe edge of the bank blocked its aim. Grinding forward a couple of feet,\nslightly overhanging the bank, the robot fired again. For a split second\nAlan seemed engulfed in flame; the heat of hell singed his head and\nback, and mud boiled in the bank by his arm.\n\nAgain the robot trembled. It jerked forward a foot and its blaster swung\nslightly away. But only for a moment. Then the gun swung back again.\n\nSuddenly, as if sensing something wrong, its tracks slammed into\nreverse. It stood poised for a second, its treads spinning crazily as\nthe earth collapsed underneath it, where Alan had dug, then it fell with\na heavy splash into the mud, ten feet from where Alan stood.\n\nWithout hesitation Alan threw himself across the blaster housing,\nfrantically locking his arms around the barrel as the robot's treads\nchurned furiously in the sticky mud, causing it to buck and plunge like\na Brahma bull. The treads stopped and the blaster jerked upwards\nwrenching Alan's arms, then slammed down. Then the whole housing whirled\naround and around, tilting alternately up and down like a steel-skinned\nwater monster trying to dislodge a tenacious crab, while Alan, arms and\nlegs wrapped tightly around the blaster barrel and housing, pressed\nfiercely against the robot's metal skin.\n\nSlowly, trying to anticipate and shift his weight with the spinning\nplunges, Alan worked his hand down to his right hip. He fumbled for the\nsheath clipped to his belt, found it, and extracted a stubby hunting\nknife. Sweat and blood in his eyes, hardly able to move on the wildly\nswinging turret, he felt down the sides to the thin crack between the\nrevolving housing and the stationary portion of the robot. With a quick\nprayer he jammed in the knife blade--and was whipped headlong into the\nmud as the turret literally snapped to a stop.\n\nThe earth, jungle and moons spun in a pinwheeled blur, slowed, and\nsettled to their proper places. Standing in the sticky, sweet-smelling\nooze, Alan eyed the robot apprehensively. Half buried in mud, it stood\nquiet in the shadowy light except for an occasional, almost spasmodic\njerk of its blaster barrel. For the first time that night Alan allowed\nhimself a slight smile. \"A blade in the old gear box, eh? How does that\nfeel, boy?\"\n\nHe turned. \"Well, I'd better get out of here before the knife slips or\nthe monster cooks up some more tricks with whatever it's got for a\nbrain.\" Digging little footholds in the soft bank, he climbed up and\nstood once again in the rustling jungle darkness.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how Pete could cram enough brain into one of\nthose things to make it hunt and track so perfectly.\" He tried to\nvisualize the computing circuits needed for the operation of its\ntracking mechanism alone. \"There just isn't room for the electronics.\nYou'd need a computer as big as the one at camp headquarters.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the distance the sky blazed as a blaster roared in the jungle. Then\nAlan heard the approaching robot, crunching and snapping its way through\nthe undergrowth like an onrushing forest fire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\nThey communicate with each other! The one I jammed must be calling\nothers to help.\"\n\nHe began to move along the bank, away from the crashing sounds. Suddenly\nhe stopped, his eyes widened. \"Of course! Radio! I'll bet anything\nthey're automatically controlled by the camp computer. That's where their\nbrain is!\" He paused. \"Then, if that were put out of commission ...\" He\njerked away from the bank and half ran, half pulled himself through the\nundergrowth towards the camp.\n\nTrees exploded to his left as another robot fired in his direction, too\nfar away to be effective but churning towards him through the blackness.\n\nAlan changed direction slightly to follow a line between the two robots\ncoming up from either side, behind him. His eyes were well accustomed to\nthe dark now, and he managed to dodge most of the shadowy vines and\nbranches before they could snag or trip him. Even so, he stumbled in the\nwiry underbrush and his legs were a mass of stinging slashes from ankle\nto thigh.\n\nThe crashing rumble of the killer robots shook the night behind him,\nnearer sometimes, then falling slightly back, but following constantly,\nmore unshakable than bloodhounds because a man can sometimes cover a\nscent, but no man can stop his thoughts. Intermittently, like\nphotographers' strobes, blue flashes would light the jungle about him.\nThen, for seconds afterwards his eyes would see dancing streaks of\nyellow and sharp multi-colored pinwheels that alternately shrunk and\nexpanded as if in a surrealist's nightmare. Alan would have to pause and\nsqueeze his eyelids tight shut before he could see again, and the robots\nwould move a little closer.\n\nTo his right the trees silhouetted briefly against brilliance as a third\nrobot slowly moved up in the distance. Without thinking, Alan turned\nslightly to the left, then froze in momentary panic. \"I should be at the\ncamp now. Damn, what direction am I going?\" He tried to think back, to\nvisualize the twists and turns he'd taken in the jungle. \"All I need is\nto get lost.\"\n\nHe pictured the camp computer with no one to stop it, automatically\nsending its robots in wider and wider forays, slowly wiping every trace\nof life from the planet. Technologically advanced machines doing the job\nfor which they were built, completely, thoroughly, without feeling, and\nwithout human masters to separate sense from futility. Finally parts\nwould wear out, circuits would short, and one by one the killers would\ncrunch to a halt. A few birds would still fly then, but a unique animal\nlife, rare in the universe, would exist no more. And the bones of\nchildren, eager girls, and their men would also lie, beside a rusty\nhulk, beneath the alien sun.\n\n\"Peggy!\"\n\nAs if in answer, a tree beside him breathed fire, then exploded. In the\nbrief flash of the blaster shot, Alan saw the steel glint of a robot\nonly a hundred yards away, much nearer than he had thought. \"Thank\nheaven for trees!\" He stepped back, felt his foot catch in something,\nclutched futilely at some leaves and fell heavily.\n\nPain danced up his leg as he grabbed his ankle. Quickly he felt the\nthrobbing flesh. \"Damn the rotten luck, anyway!\" He blinked the pain\ntears from his eyes and looked up--into a robot's blaster, jutting out\nof the foliage, thirty yards away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstinctively, in one motion Alan grabbed his pocket blaster and fired.\nTo his amazement the robot jerked back, its gun wobbled and started to\ntilt away. Then, getting itself under control, it swung back again to\nface Alan. He fired again, and again the robot reacted. It seemed\nfamiliar somehow. Then he remembered the robot on the river bank,\njiggling and swaying for seconds after each shot. \"Of course!\" He cursed\nhimself for missing the obvious. \"The blaster static blanks out radio\ntransmission from the computer for a few seconds. They even do it to\nthemselves!\"\n\nFiring intermittently, he pulled himself upright and hobbled ahead\nthrough the bush. The robot shook spasmodically with each shot, its gun\ntilted upward at an awkward angle.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, Alan saw stars, real stars brilliant in the night\nsky, and half dragging his swelling leg he stumbled out of the jungle\ninto the camp clearing. Ahead, across fifty yards of grass stood the\nheadquarters building, housing the robot-controlling computer. Still\nfiring at short intervals he started across the clearing, gritting his\nteeth at every step.\n\nStraining every muscle in spite of the agonizing pain, Alan forced\nhimself to a limping run across the uneven ground, carefully avoiding\nthe insect hills that jutted up through the grass. From the corner of\nhis eye he saw another of the robots standing shakily in the dark edge\nof the jungle waiting, it seemed, for his small blaster to run dry.\n\n\"Be damned! You can't win now!\" Alan yelled between blaster shots,\nalmost irrational from the pain that ripped jaggedly through his leg.\nThen it happened. A few feet from the building's door his blaster quit.\nA click. A faint hiss when he frantically jerked the trigger again and\nagain, and the spent cells released themselves from the device, falling\nin the grass at his feet. He dropped the useless gun.\n\n\"No!\" He threw himself on the ground as a new robot suddenly appeared\naround the edge of the building a few feet away, aimed, and fired. Air\nburned over Alan's back and ozone tingled in his nostrils.\n\nBlinding itself for a few seconds with its own blaster static, the robot\npaused momentarily, jiggling in place. In this instant, Alan jammed his\nhands into an insect hill and hurled the pile of dirt and insects\ndirectly at the robot's antenna. In a flash, hundreds of the winged\nthings erupted angrily from the hole in a swarming cloud, each part of\nwhich was a speck of life transmitting mental energy to the robot's\npickup devices.\n\nConfused by the sudden dispersion of mind impulses, the robot fired\nerratically as Alan crouched and raced painfully for the door. It fired\nagain, closer, as he fumbled with the lock release. Jagged bits of\nplastic and stone ripped past him, torn loose by the blast.\n\nFrantically, Alan slammed open the door as the robot, sensing him\nstrongly now, aimed point blank. He saw nothing, his mind thought of\nnothing but the red-clad safety switch mounted beside the computer. Time\nstopped. There was nothing else in the world. He half-jumped, half-fell\ntowards it, slowly, in tenths of seconds that seemed measured out in\nyears.\n\nThe universe went black.\n\nLater. Brilliance pressed upon his eyes. Then pain returned, a\nmulti-hurting thing that crawled through his body and dragged ragged\ntentacles across his brain. He moaned.\n\nA voice spoke hollowly in the distance. \"He's waking. Call his wife.\"\n\nAlan opened his eyes in a white room; a white light hung over his head.\nBeside him, looking down with a rueful smile, stood a young man wearing\nspace medical insignia. \"Yes,\" he acknowledged the question in Alan's\neyes, \"you hit the switch. That was three days ago. When you're up again\nwe'd all like to thank you.\"\n\nSuddenly a sobbing-laughing green-eyed girl was pressed tightly against\nhim. Neither of them spoke. They couldn't. There was too much to say.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\n    October 1958.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
