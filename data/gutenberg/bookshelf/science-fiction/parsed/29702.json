Fail now? He gritted his teeth. No! He would\nwrench victory from Fate after all, even though at this moment mine\nguards must be searching the nearby mountains, for him and his\ncompanions, and a warning was being broadcast to all the planets and\nspace ships to watch the little prison tender ship, the one that was\nused to transfer prisoners from liners out in space to Mercury and its\nInterplanetary Council prison mines to which all who were sentenced came\non one-way tickets only. This was the first time, Winford reflected\ngrimly, that the sphere had ever carried outbound passengers.\n\nA long, quavering wail sounded from the hold below. Winford scowled.\nThat fellow, Agar, again. Too bad, for he was unquestionably an\nengineering genius and thoroughly dependable when he didn't get one of\nhis spells and imagine he was a godo-dog on the red steppes of his\nnative Mars. A little rest and gentle treatment would unquestionably\nwork wonders. Again the wail, followed this time by a series of growls.\n\nWinford slid open the door that separated the control nest from the hold\nof the little prison tender ship. The other five men had withdrawn to\nthe other side of the cabin and were watching listlessly the big,\nragged, barrel-chested Martian crouching on all fours against the side\nof the cabin and ferociously baring his teeth.\n\n\"What's the matter down there?\" called Winford sharply.\n\nSix pairs of eyes looked up at him. Agar forgot he was a dog and stared\nwith the rest. They were an unkempt, ragged lot with unshaven faces and\nthe dirty, white canvas uniforms of mine prisoners. The group was\ncomposed of four Martians and two Venusians.\n\n\"Let's go back,\" growled Nizzo, whose squat, powerful body and long arms\nbespoke his Venus ancestry. \"It's death out here. No food. No water,\nexcepting the emergency ration you have up there in the box. That will\nscarcely last till we can reach Mercury again. Now you tell us that the\nfuel is nearly exhausted. Let's go back. I say! We don't want to swing\nabout the Sun in this as our tomb for all eternity. At least we eat and\ndrink at the mines, even though the whips of the drivers hurry us on to\nan early death.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Nizzo,\" harshly retorted Winford. \"You know what they do\nwhen escaped prisoners are brought back, or come of their own free will.\nThe Universe knows nothing of the caged saurians in the warden's\ngardens, nor of the incorrigible prisoners that go to feed them. But I\nknow--we all of us know. Far better to remain out here and die whole,\nthan to be devoured alive by a slobbering horror.\"\n\nA heated argument ensued among the men below. Presently Nizzo looked up\nagain.\n\n\"But you have no plan,\" he shouted at the Earthman. \"We have followed\nyou blindly so far, and here we are off the traffic lanes. Our only hope\nof being picked up now is one of space patrol ships. And short shrift\nmay we expect from them!\"\n\nWinford scowled impatiently.\n\n\"Listen, men,\" he began. \"This is a desperate venture, I know, and I\npicked every one of you carefully. You are not common scum of the prison\nmines. Every man of you can be depended upon to put through a daring\nescape of this nature. Every man of you is an innocent victim of the\nrotten politicians and corrupt officials that now hold sway in the Three\nPlanets. Take Jarl there, for example.\" He indicated a big, patient,\nresigned Martian. \"He is under life sentence in the penal mines simply\nbecause his brother-in-law wanted his lands and wealth. As for myself, I\nhad a sister who suffered the misfortune of being seen and coveted by\nSilas Teutoberg, a member of the Earth Council....\"\n\nHe choked at the thought, his pale face rigid with emotion. Those below\nsaw the flash of his lambent eyes. He controlled himself with an effort,\nand continued:\n\n\"I have said nothing of any plan beyond that of making our escape in\nthis prison tender off Mercury, but I had a plan behind that. It is true\nthat we seem to be off the regular traffic lanes, but space liners\nbetween Venus and Earth just now are cutting in quite close to Mercury,\ndue to the position of the three planets in their orbits. This formed\nthe basis of the whole venture.\n\n\"During the three interplanetary days we have floated out here, I have\nrepeatedly scanned the Void, thinking every minute we would sight a\ncraft we could reach. But so far luck has been against us. All I ask is\nthat you do not allow yourselves to be discouraged, for sooner or later\nwe'll get a break.\"\n\nA chorus of enthusiastic approval answered him. Winford sighed with\nrelief, then stared abruptly through the window and gave a shout. The\nothers below swarmed up the ladder and crowded into the tiny control\nnest. Winford pointed.\n\nFar off against the black depths of space toward Venus gleamed the tiny,\nelliptical, silvery hull of a ship, bearing slightly toward them.\nAlthough sharply outlined, the craft was hundreds of miles away as the\nmen realized. Winford checked it swiftly through the telescope distance\ncalculator, determined its speed, and rapidly formed his plan.\n\n\"There are plenty of space suits in the lockers,\" he said tersely. \"Get\ninto them. Stand by the air-lock. You, Jarl, get into the lock and take\na cable with an electro-magnet anchor. Lash yourself to it. When I give\nthe signal by blinking the lights in the lock, open the outer door and\nleap across to the other ship. I know you risk death from their rays,\nbut it is our only chance. Clamp the anchor against the side of the ship\nand locate the emergency entrance lock.\"\n\n\"Suppose there is none?\" interrupted Jarl stoically.\n\n\"Chances are there will be. The interplanetary treaties call for them on\nmost ships since those five hundred passengers perished trying vainly to\nenter a liner after their own ship was smashed by a meteor out near\nJupiter several years ago. Anyway, it's our only chance. You, Nizzo and\nRagna, enter the air-lock with Jarl so that if he misses, you can pull\nhim back. Now hurry. I'll have to maneuver this tub around so that I can\napproach the ship, if possible, without being noticed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe others scuttled back down the ladder, leaving Winford to rapidly\nwork out his final calculations. The ship, traveling at a rate of six\nthousand miles an hour, would miss their little sphere by about a\nhundred miles. The ship was probably a slow speed freighter, a guess\nthat was supported by the lack of port-holes in the hull.\n\nIt was a ticklish task that Winford faced. He could either approach the\nfreighter from against the sun, trusting that the navigation officer on\nduty would fail to notice the dark blot of the little tender against the\nblinding glare. Or he could get on the far side of the ship and approach\nit, concealed by its black shadow. He decided on the latter plan.\n\nThe freighter was coming up fast. Winford eased the accelerator open,\nand moved off at right angles to its line of progress to place it\nbetween him and the sun. If the officer in charge of the freighter\nshould see the tiny dot go shooting presently across his path, he would\ndoubtless mistake it for a wandering meteor. As soon as he crossed the\npath of the big ship, Winford slowly turned his little craft toward the\nprotecting shadow of his prospective victim, and picked up speed as\nquickly as he dared until the little tender was traveling at the same\nspeed as the freighter. Lucky it was for him that the big craft was not\na mail liner, for if it had been, the little ball could never have\ngained speed enough to equal it.\n\nThe shadow of the freighter presently enveloped the little ship, and the\ntwo hung side by side. Winford eased the tender in toward the big craft,\nfully realizing that the meteor warning dial in the control room of the\nfreighter would hint at his presence by its pronounced fluctuation. But\nthere was no help for it; he could only take the chance that the\nnavigator in charge would not investigate. Winford peered up anxiously\nat the windows of the control room. Apparently the little craft had not\nyet been discovered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLess than a hundred yards now separated the two craft. Winford flashed\nhis signal to the air-lock. A moment later a dark blob that shut off the\nlight of the stars in depths below floated across the gap from the\ntender to the freighter. The electric meter on the control board\nregistered a sudden fluctuation as the electro-magnet anchor attached\nitself to the hull of the big ship.\n\nWinford snapped off the propulsion beams, seized two ray pistols that\nlay on the chart table, and ducked down the ladder. His companions were\nstanding before the inner door of the air-lock in their bulging space\nsuits, awaiting his order to leave the tender. He quickly got into a\nsuit, clamped on the helmet and screwed tight the connections. Then he\nopened the door of the air-lock and motioned the others into it,\nfollowing the last man in.\n\nNizzo and Ragna were waiting there, and as the inner door closed,\nautomatically opening the outer door, they pointed to the cable\nstretching away across forty yards of empty space to the side of the big\nfreighter. Winford could make out faintly the form of Jarl, who was\nclambering cautiously up the bulging side of the ship on hands and\nknees, seeking the emergency air-lock. Winford beckoned to the others to\nfollow, and leaped out into space along the cable.\n\nIt was a terrifying experience, for no matter how often a man made such\na trip, there was always the primitive fear of falling into those\nmillions upon millions of miles of space below where the stars gleamed,\nred, green, white and blue in the cold depths. Yet a man had no weight.\nHe merely pulled himself along the cable, which kept him from getting\nlost.\n\nHe reached the bulging side of the hull and continued upward on hands\nand knees, now held to it by its own attraction for his body. The others\nfollowed, and scattered out seeking the emergency entrance lock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of an hour they were in despair. There was no emergency\nentrance lock! Winford bitterly resigned himself to their fate. This was\nthe end of their daring attempt. He must go forward now to the control\nroom windows and attract the attention of the navigating officer. It\nmeant surrender and subsequent death in the teeth of the caged saurians,\nbut if they remained much longer where they were they would freeze to\ndeath anyway, for the batteries that warmed their suits were running\ndown under the continued strain, and when they ceased to function, the\ndeadly cold of interstellar space would claim them. He managed to make\nknown his intentions to the others and was starting forward when Fate\ntook a hand.\n\nThe prison tender ship, which was still floating at the end of its cable\nat the side of the freighter, relinquished itself to the play of the\nforces that rule the measureless void and began to set up an orbit of\nits own about the bigger ship. It came to the end of its tether and\nswung gently against the hull of the freighter, sending a violent\nvibration through it; then it rebounded and struck with another crash\nwhich was utterly soundless to the stranded men on the outside of the\nhull, who, nevertheless, felt the vibration plainly.\n\nWinford halted abruptly. The crew inside the ship would investigate.\nFate was offering the desperate men on the outside another chance. He\nturned and beckoned to the others and hurried aft toward the regular\nair-lock, which was operated only from inside the ship. Hastily he\nplaced the men about the outer door. Then they waited.\n\nFive minutes later it opened, and two men in space suits crawled out.\nJarl captured the first man single-handed, and Nizzo and Ragna, with\nperfect teamwork, overpowered the second before he realized what was\ntaking place. Within a minute the men crowded into the air-lock, and\nshut the outer portal. Automatically, the inner door slid open.\n\nWinford stepped out into the passageway with his ray pistols, covering\nthe half dozen members of the crew who gaped at the intruders in\nspeechless astonishment. One man recovered his wits and started to run.\nWinford's pistol stabbed a ray after him, and he collapsed. The other\nmembers of the crew silently raised their hands in surrender and were\nherded into a nearby stateroom and locked in, including the two in space\nsuits who had been captured on the hull outside.\n\n\"Overpower and imprison the crew at once,\" Winford ordered, as he\nemerged from his space suit. \"Jarl, you take charge, and work through\nthe ship. Miss no one. Bind them, imprison them, if you can, and if you\nmust, use sterner measures. Remember you are now pirates, and if we\ndon't capture this ship, the ship will capture us. I'll go ahead alone\nto the control room and introduce myself to the officers there. When you\nhave cleaned things up, join me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Robers was peering out through the window at the dark blob of\nthe space tender near the rear of the big freighter when the door of the\ncontrol room opened softly and Winford slipped inside with leveled ray\npistols. The two navigation officers on duty gasped in astonishment.\nCaptain Robers whirled around. His momentary amazement gave way to\nwrath.\n\n\"Who the devil are you, and what do you want?\" he bellowed.\n\nWinford's eyes blazed coldly. The ray pistols in his hands twitched\nmeaningly.\n\n\"Civility first, Captain. Hands off those instruments, gentlemen. Stand\nup. Face the windows. Thank you.\"\n\nWith catlike quickness Winford leaped behind the chart table. A glance\nshowed that the ship was holding to its course with unchecked speed.\nOnly the meteor detector fluctuated from the presence of the little\nspace ship outside. No worry there. Disintegrator rays would soon\ndissolve it, and with it the last visible evidence of their presence on\nthe ship.\n\n\"Now, Captain, you may turn about facing me. I want a little\ninformation.\"\n\n\"You'll sniff gas for this!\" snarled the officer. \"This is piracy pure\nand simple. Who are you, anyway?\"\n\nWinford smiled ironically. Captain Robers' eyes widened suddenly and he\npaled slightly, as he recognized the dirty white uniform.\n\n\"The mines of Mercury!\" he ejaculated. \"We received a heliogram not\ntwenty-four hours ago warning us of your escape. You're Evan Winford of\nEarth!\"\n\nWinford bowed slightly.\n\n\"At your service, Captain. My six companions are even now trussing up\nthe remainder of your crew down below. Don't choke, Captain. You are in\nno danger, unless you make it yourself. I desire a little information\nabout the Universe. You see I have been out of touch for the last three\nyears during my enforced sojourn on Mercury.\"\n\nCaptain Robers glared at Winford.\n\n\"Tell me, Captain, who are you, and what is this craft?\"\n\nThe officer thrust out his chin stubbornly, then glanced at the pistol\ncovering him and changed his mind.\n\n\"Captain Robers. The freighter is the _Golden Fleece_.\"\n\n\"Port?\"\n\n\"New York. I am homeward bound with a cargo from Ceres of the\nAsteroids.\"\n\nWinford's eyes gleamed momentarily.\n\n\"Iridium, eh?\"\n\nCaptain Robers declined to answer. The valuable metal, which was found\nmostly in abundance among the Asteroids and particularly on Ceres, had\nproved the bait that lured pirates in flocks from all parts of the\nUniverse to prey on the freighters that carried it, usually under heavy\nguard. The _Golden Fleece_ had obviously been trying to slip through\nunder the camouflage of an ordinary tramp freighter when Winford and his\nfollowers boarded her. Robers saw no reason for trying to lie about\nCeres, since Winford would discover it later when he examined the log.\nWinford, however, did not press the question about the cargo.\n\n\"Who is the owner, Captain?\"\n\n\"The Interstellar Transportation Company, New York, Silas Teutoberg,\npresident.\"\n\nWinford leaped to his feet.\n\n\"Repeat that name, Captain,\" he ordered harshly.\n\n\"Silas Teutoberg,\" sullenly complied the officer. \"But don't be so\nexcited. He has already resigned.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nA crafty light appeared in the captain's eyes. He sensed a slight\nadvantage in retaining this knowledge himself.\n\n\"I decline to answer,\" he stated.\n\nThe lambent flames leaped ominously in Winford's eyes. He toyed with the\nray pistol expressively, then glanced up at a sudden interruption. The\ncontrol room door had opened, admitting Jarl and Ragna.\n\n\"The crew is all accounted for,\" announced Jarl. \"We imprisoned a\nhundred men and have control.\"\n\n\"Very good, Jarl,\" replied Winford calmly. \"Ragna, take these two\nnavigating officers down and lock them up with the rest. Jarl, you\nremain here. I have a little task for you.\"\n\n\"Awah,\" replied Jarl, using the Martian term for \"very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Captain Robers here is going to strip off his clothing and pass out\nthrough the air-lock into space.\" Winford spoke each word with cold\nprecision.\n\nThe officer jerked up his head in sudden terror. He had once witnessed\nthe modern equivalent for the ancient piratical sentence of walking the\nplank and the vivid memory rose before him. He saw again the nude man\ncowering inside the air-lock as the inner door shut, the wafting out\ninto interstellar space of his struggling body as the atmosphere inside\nthe lock rushed out of the outer opening door, and the fatal bloating of\nthe body from the sudden pressure from within. The horror of it unlocked\nthe officer's tongue.\n\n\"I'll answer, I'll answer!\" he cried. \"What do you want to know?\"\n\n\"Tell me why Silas Teutoberg is resigning as president of the\nInterstellar Transportation Company.\"\n\nIn the momentary silence that followed, Jarl's eyes narrowed with sudden\nintensity. His interest escaped Winford, who was watching Robers\nclosely. The officer gulped with relief.\n\n\"Teutoberg has been named governor of the new emigration colonies the\nUnited States is establishing on Ganymede,\" he explained hurriedly. \"The\nEarth Council, which recently took over the most fertile provinces on\nthe third moon of Jupiter, with the full approval of the Interplanetary\nCouncil, has named him for the post. The position is nearly the same as\nthat of an absolute monarch. But he could not hold a government post and\nretain his executive position with the Interstellar people, so he\nresigned.\"\n\nWinford eyed him skeptically. Captain Robers, now greatly agitated,\ngestured frantically toward the chart table.\n\n\"I am telling you the truth!\" he assured Winford fervently. \"You'll find\nsomewhere on the table a copy of the Heliogram News which tells of his\ndeparture from New York less than twelve hours ago in a specially\nchartered liner with his staff and friends for New Chicago, on Ganymede.\nIt also tells of his approaching marriage to Princess Irkeen, daughter\nof King Donossus, a political marriage that will assure Teutoberg's\nposition with the natives.\"\n\n\"Poor girl,\" muttered Winford under his breath, searching among the\nloose papers on the chart table for the copy of the news which was\nreceived every twelve hours by automatic helioprinter from New York\nmillions of miles away. He read the article about Teutoberg through and\nlaid aside the paper. Turning to the charts he jotted down a few hasty\ncalculations, and stepped to the controls where he set a new course for\nthe \"iron mike\" of the space freighter to follow.\n\n\"Captain Robers, I have changed my mind about having you go out into\nspace from the air-lock,\" he announced, turning again to the anxious\nofficer. \"We will hold you prisoner with your men and later on will set\nyou down on one of Jupiter's smaller satellites--Callisto, if possible,\nsince the living conditions there are quite satisfactory. Word will be\nsent to Mars of where you can be found. All of your crew, excepting\nthose who wish to sign on with me, will be freed with you. I and my six\ncompanions are hardly enough to operate such a craft as this.\nIncidentally, we are appropriating the _Golden Fleece_ and its cargo. If\nthe Interstellar people object, they may present the bill to Silas\nTeutoberg, and he can deduct it from the income my property yields him.\"\n\nCaptain Robers glanced up curiously at the harsh bitterness that crept\ninto Winford's voice. Then his glance shifted to Jarl, and he was amazed\nto see the malevolent expression that appeared on the Martian's face as\nhe listened to Winford's words. The moment passed, and Jarl silently\nescorted the officers below to be locked up with the rest of his crew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree weeks later, Earth time, the _Golden Fleece_ slipped into the\natmosphere of Callisto, the fourth satellite of mighty Jupiter, which\nswung in its orbit a million and a quarter miles from the great planet.\nFar off to the west, separated by two million miles of empty space,\nfloated Ganymede, the third satellite, on which the people of the United\nStates were now gaining a foothold with their newly planted colonies.\n\nThe big freighter, under the engineering genius of Agar, had made a\nmarvelously speedy journey from its original position just outside the\norbit of Mercury to this point nearly four hundred and fifty million\nmiles away from the little planet. Winford studied the ground below. He\nwas only partly acquainted with the topography of Callisto and wanted to\nbe sure to pick a spot where Captain Robers and his men could be certain\nof surviving until help arrived. His eye picked out a satisfactory spot\nclose beside the Gnan River in one of the stunted conifer forests of the\nplanet. Swiftly he dropped the big freighter until it hovered but a few\nyards above the ground.\n\nA freight port-hole was opened, and Captain Robers, accompanied by half\nhis crew, prepared to descend. They were all bundled in heavy garments,\nfor the temperature of Callisto, never high, frequently drops to\nsub-zero readings. Winford stood at the port and watched the men climb\ndown the rope ladder to the ground below.\n\nRobers was last to go. He faced Winford bitterly, for this escaped lifer\nfrom Mercury had stolen not only his ship, but half his crew as well,\nand the prospect of a liberal share of the rich iridium cargo in the\nhold.\n\n\"You'll regret this day!\" snarled the captain. \"I'll be in the front row\nof spectators when you sniff the death gas in the glass execution cage\non Mars. Hundreds have tried this sort of thing before you, and every\nman of them has come finally to the cage.\"\n\n\"You're only delaying us, Captain Robers,\" replied Winford coldly. \"I am\nin a hurry to be on my way. Kindly move down the ladder and join your\nmen. Your hand weapons and food supplies will be dropped by parachute as\nwe leave. I might add that in a short time I expect to be in a position\nto broadcast an S O S message for you which should bring rescue ships\nhere to Callisto for you. Good-by.\"\n\nHe turned away, leaving the officer to descend the ladder in baffled\nfury to the ground below, where his men huddled together in the\nunfamiliar cold, and stared half fearful at the far-away sun glowing\nlike a yellow arc-light in the depths of space half a billion miles\naway.\n\nWhen the rising ship reached the thousand-foot level, the weapons and\nfood were dropped by parachute, and the port-hole closed and locked.\nWinford hurried forward to the control room where the two navigators,\nwho had signed with him for a hundred and twentieth share of the iridium\neach, were already pointing the nose of the ship up through the purple\nheavens toward Ganymede.\n\n\"Open her up! Use the emergency propulsion beams!\" ordered Winford. \"We\nare overdue now for my tryst with this new governor at New Chicago!\"\n\nThe officers gazed at him in awe, wondering what desperate thing he\nplanned at the new colonial capital.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinford was poring over the maps of New Chicago six hours later in the\nchart room when one of the navigation officers touched him on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"Battle sphere rapidly overhauling us from sunward, sir,\" said the man.\n\"Approaching us against the glare of sunlight until it was so close when\nwe discovered it that escape is now impossible. I'd say it is one of the\nnew 4-Q heavies of the Interplanetary Council patrol fleet.\"\n\nWinford hurried to the telescope. As his anxious eye took in the\nspherical outline of the battle craft, showing as a silvery crescent to\nthe rear and starboard of them, he recognized it as one of the heavily\narmored spheres of the Interplanetary Council's fleet with the new long\nrange K-ray disintegrator guns.\n\nWinford seized a telescope speed calculator. The sphere was coming up\nfar too rapidly to permit the _Golden Fleece_ to pick up speed soon\nenough to escape--although he was confident the freighter could do it\nnow, since Agar had changed its propulsion machinery.\n\nPerhaps the commander of the battle sphere was merely curious about the\n_Golden Fleece_ since it appeared to be an ordinary tramp freighter with\nno distinguishing emblems or other identification, and was coming close\nto give her a better look. Or perhaps he was hurrying to some\ndestination and his nearness to the _Golden Fleece_ was merely\naccidental.\n\nWhatever the cause, there remained but one thing to do, and that was to\nkeep the freighter on its course as though nothing out of the ordinary\nwas taking place. Winford turned to the communication board and cut in\nthe universal radio wave. The instrument was silent. He sighed. At least\nthe commander of the battle sphere was not trying to communicate with\nhim.\n\nWinford turned back to the window again. The sphere was quite close now,\nand its speed was dropping rapidly. Suddenly the radio loud-speaker\nhummed to life.\n\n\"Ahoy there, aboard the freighter,\" sounded a stern, determined voice.\n\"This is the Interplanetary Council battle sphere, _Eagle_, nearing you.\nWe are coming aboard you to investigate. Make ready your air-lock to\nreceive us. Attempt nothing hostile. Hundred-kilowatt ray guns are\ntrained on you.\"\n\nWinford cut in the microphone and answered with the customary \"O. K.\"\nreply; then he turned to the two white-faced navigators.\n\n\"Carry on as usual,\" he said grimly. \"Perhaps we can fool them once they\nare aboard.\"\n\nThen he turned to the phone connecting with the crew's quarters. He\nhurriedly explained the situation to Jarl and instructed him to receive\nthe boarding party at the air-lock.\n\nThe big battle sphere was drawing close alongside. Magnet grapnels shot\nacross the narrow space between the two craft and gripped the side of\nthe freighter, followed by the cable bridge along which the boarding\nparty presently came wavering their way to the air-lock of the\nfreighter.\n\nWinford counted fifty men, then turned away dejectedly. This was no\nordinary inspection party, but a prize crew coming aboard. He sat down\nwearily. Just as victory seemed almost within his grasp--had been\nactually in his hand when he had started to Ganymede--this battle sphere\npopped up out of nowhere like an inescapable doom to strike him and his\ncompanions down. He gritted his teeth. Some way, somehow he would still\nwin out. He and his fellows had come too far to be cheated of liberty\nnow.\n\nThe door of the control room opened, and a smart young officer in gold\nand gray of the Interplanetary Council Marine service entered,\naccompanied by three privates with drawn pistols who took their\npositions near the door. Winford noted the clean-cut lines and fresh\nfeatures of the officer and felt that under different circumstances he\nwould like to know him.\n\n\"I am Lieutenant Commander 6666-A,\" the officer introduced himself,\nusing the designation the Interplanetary Council required of all their\nfighting men. \"You are Evan Winford, are you not?\"\n\nWinford nodded.\n\n\"You nearly got away with it, Winford,\" complimented the officer with a\nboyish grin. \"I almost admire you for it. But you made at least one\nfatal error.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" asked Winford curiously.\n\n\"When you put Captain Robers and his men off this ship they smuggled out\nwith them a hand-operated helio set. Each man carried a part. Within an\nhour after you left they had it assembled and were cranking out S O S\nsignals. We happened to be but a million miles off Callisto and picked\nup their message. At once our commander decided to start out and rope in\nthe _Golden Fleece_ before you did any further damage. And here we are.\"\n\nWinford cursed himself under his breath. Fool that he had been not to\nhave had the men and their baggage searched more carefully before he\nallowed them to leave the freighter. Nizzo was responsible for that. He\nshould be--but it was too late now. No use crying over spilled milk. He\nforced a grin and shrugged.\n\n\"'The best laid plans of mice and men--'\" he quoted philosophically. \"I\nhope the entire blame for this wild venture is put on my shoulders where\nit belongs when we are brought to trial. These two navigators here and\nthe rest of the men are in no way responsible. I forced every man of\nthem under pain of death to join me.\"\n\nThe young officer shook his head and smiled.\n\n\"Not a chance of that, Winford. You'll all stand trial alike, and you\nknow it. You are rather a strange sort of pirate, it seems to me, to\noffer yourself as a sacrifice for your men. I'd say you are too\ntender-hearted for buccaneering in the Void.\"\n\n\"If I had succeeded in reaching New Chicago, you might have gained a\ndifferent impression of me,\" retorted Winford, his lambent eyes flaming\nat the thought. \"I have sworn to kill Silas Teutoberg, the new governor\nof Ganymede, because he sent me to die in the mines of Mercury for a\ncrime I never committed.\"\n\nThe young officer laughed.\n\n\"You can set your mind at rest about him, Winford. He was due at New\nChicago five days ago in his specially chartered space liner from New\nYork. Nothing was heard from his ship ten days after he left New York\nwith his guests aboard. His last reported position was near the Mars\norbit and since then nothing has come out of the Void. They'll just\nchalk him under the 'Lost in Space' column on the admiralty boards of\nthe Universe and give the credit for his disappearance to some hurtling\nmeteor. We were on our way to search for the remains of his liner when\nwe intercepted the messages from Captain Robers and his men on\nCallisto.\"\n\nWinford's face was bleak.\n\n\"Fate has prevented me from achieving my greatest desire,\" he said\nharshly. \"To rid the Universe of that scourge to humanity would have\nbeen one of the sweetest moments of my life. I've dreamed of it for\nyears.\"\n\nThe officer lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, but I'd say the chance is gone in more ways than\none. Teutoberg is undoubtedly dead, and you are on your way to the gas\nexecution cage on Mars. Incidentally, you are now my prisoner. I'll not\nlock you in the hold with the rest of your crew, but will confine you to\nyour stateroom.\"\n\nWinford surveyed him curiously.\n\n\"I warn you that I'll take advantage of any opportunity to escape,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe officer grinned.\n\n\"That's to be expected. So would any other man doomed to die. But the\ncoronium doors, locks and walls of the _Golden Fleece's_ staterooms are\npractically escape proof, and with two of my marines on guard outside\nyour door, with orders to kill if you break out, I feel reasonably\nsafe.\"\n\nImprisoned in his stateroom, Winford threw himself on his bunk. Too\nearly to attempt anything yet, he considered. It would be better to wait\na few days--at least until _Eagle_ had departed. Besides, he would have\nto work out a plan for escape.\n\nHe glanced up at the port-hole. The sunlight was shifting. He arose and\npeered out. Twenty-five miles away he could see the battle sphere\nstanding out across the Void on a sunward course. The _Golden Fleece_\nwas turning her nose toward distant Mars, a long journey, since the Red\nPlanet was on the opposite side of the sun, seven hundred million miles\naway.\n\nWinford knew what was taking place. The commander of the battle sphere\nwas again resuming his mission of searching for the missing liner, while\nthe young officer and his crew were taking the _Golden Fleece_ with its\niridium cargo and pirate crew directly to Mars.\n\nMeantime the radio and audio-vision announcers on all the planets were\nbroadcasting the sensational news of the capture of the escaped\nconvict-pirates and their forthcoming trial and certain execution on\nMars. Winford turned bitterly away from the port-hole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne week had passed. Winford started up out of a sound sleep. He\nlistened tensely. There was a murmur through the big freighter. He\nrecognized it as the clanging of the great alarm gongs through the hull\nof the big ship, muffled by the walls of his stateroom. Something was\nafoot!\n\nHe threw off the covers, sprang out on the deck and pulled on his\nclothes. This might be a break! Those gongs never sounded without plenty\nof cause.\n\nHe pulled a chair to the door, mounted it, and cautiously opening the\ntransom which he had previously loosened, thrust his head out into the\npassage.\n\nA marine was running down the passage. The guards before Winford's door\ntried to stop him, but the man ran on. Presently another came along. The\nguard was more successful.\n\n\"Say, Buddie, what's all the excitement?\" he demanded.\n\n\"We've found Teutoberg's liner, or rather, it has found us!\" exclaimed\nthe marine. \"They say old Teutoberg has trained his heaviest guns on us\nand is demanding that we surrender. Our skipper doesn't know just what\nto make of it. He's arguing with Teutoberg by radio that this old tub is\nin the hands of the law already and that he is taking it to Mars for the\npiracy court. Teutoberg says he won't be fooled by any such bunk as\nthat; he knows we are all pirates and he is going to have this ship\nregardless of anything, since it belongs to his line. I've got to be\nhurrying along. We're getting the big guns ready, the few that we have.\"\n\nWinford cautiously withdrew his head. His eyes were glowing. The whole\nscheme was as plain as day now. Teutoberg knew as well as every informed\nperson in the Universe did that the _Golden Fleece_ was in the hands of\nthe Interplanetary Council marines. That talk about being entitled to\nthe freighter because it was owned by his shipping line was so much\nrubbish. He was protected by insurance. What he wanted was the insurance\nand the ten million dollars' worth of iridium in the hold as well.\n\nFurthermore, he had intended to have it all along. It was part of his\ndiabolical scheme to put the shipment on an unprotected freighter. Then\nhe had chartered a liner privately for his venture in piracy. When the\nliner was \"lost\" he was out searching for the _Golden Fleece_ along the\nlanes where it should have been had not he, Winford, and his companions\ncaptured the craft and sent it hurtling out toward Ganymede. And now\nTeutoberg had succeeded in trailing it down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinford surveyed the transom pessimistically. Impossible to get through\nit. If only he had a ray pistol to dissolve the door lock.... The air\nventilator! He dropped down on hands and knees and peered under the\nbunk. The opening seemed large enough to let his shoulders through. If\nhe should become fast in one of the turns of the tunnel it would be all\nup with him. They'd probably find his body when the ship went into dock\nfor repairs. But this was no time to think of that.\n\nHe crawled under the bunk, took out the grating and set it beside the\nopening. Then he wormed his way into the tunnel. It was a tight fit, but\nhe could move. The first turn should bring him to the branch that opened\nout on the passage not far from his stateroom door.\n\nNever would he forget that struggle when he forced his cramped, tortured\nbody round the bend in the blackness a fraction of an inch at a time and\ncrawled up the branch. If he was mistaken--but he wasn't. Presently he\nwas looking out of the grating into the passage.\n\nMembers of the crew raced back and forth like disturbed ants. From the\nsnatches of conversation that reached him, Winford learned that\nTeutoberg had succeeded in getting the range of the freighter and was\nholding her helpless under the imposing muzzles of his heavy\ndisintegrator-ray guns.\n\nThe door of the control opened and the boyish commander, his face pale\nand drawn, thrust out his head.\n\n\"They're coming aboard, men,\" he shouted to the group in the passage\nbelow. \"I can't stop them. Our only chance may come after they are\naboard.\"\n\n\"Why don't you free the pirates and let them help us?\" cried one of the\nmen.\n\n\"Never,\" returned the young commander firmly. \"They are in our care, and\nby the gods, we are going to bring them and this ship through safe and\nsound!\"\n\nA moment later he descended the stairs and led his men aft.\n\nTeutoberg displayed a flash of generalship, for his first ten men who\ncame in through the air-lock were pistol experts. They rayed the marines\nin their tracks and cleared the passage leading to the lock, before the\ndefenders could get organized. A few minutes later the invaders were\nspreading through the ship, hunting down and ruthlessly slaying the\nmarines whom they outnumbered three to one. Scattered fights to the\ndeath took place on all the decks. Winford, snugly ensconced in his air\ntunnel, raged inwardly as the crackling of the rays and the agonized\nscreams of the wounded and dying came to his ears.\n\nThe fighting seemed to be drawing nearer. He risked peeping out. The\nyoung commander and half a dozen of his men covering themselves as best\nthey might with the inadequate protector shields of the service,\nretreated to the foot of the stairs leading up to the control room. As\nthe invaders prepared to mow them down a sudden hush fell on the men and\nthe invaders parted. A huge man stepped out before them. Winford sucked\nin his breath sharply as he recognized Teutoberg and saw him take a step\nforward in the direction of the marines.\n\nTeutoberg raised his hand toward Commander 6666-A and spoke.\n\n\"Will you surrender, or must my men obliterate you? I would say that you\npirates have your backs to the wall. Surely life is sweet. Why not\nsurrender while you still have it?\"\n\n\"We're not pirates!\" declared the young commander hotly.\n\nTeutoberg sneered.\n\n\"It will take more than a gold and gray uniform of the Interplanetary\nCouncil military forces to convince me,\" he retorted. \"Uniforms of any\nkind can be obtained anywhere in the Universe where there happens to be\na competent tailor.\"\n\n\"The only pirates, excepting yourselves, aboard this ship are under lock\nand key,\" said the commander. \"That's where you will be before this\nmatter is settled.\"\n\nTeutoberg laughed. His manner changed suddenly.\n\n\"What a line of talk for a pirate,\" he commented affably. \"Come,\nyoungster, there is no need to sacrifice lives uselessly. Surrender,\nsince you're outnumbered anyway, and let's discuss this thing on a sane\nbasis.\"\n\nCommander 6666-A hesitated. Winford could scarcely refrain from shouting\ntreachery. Then the marines lowered their shields and rays. Next instant\nthey went down under the charge of the invaders.\n\nThe young commander was chalky white when they dragged him bound and\nhelpless to his feet. A trickle of blood made a crimson line from the\ncorner of his mouth, and his eyes sparkled with helpless rage.\n\n\"You dirty snake!\" he gasped. \"You'll sniff gas for this!\"\n\nTeutoberg laughed scornfully.\n\n\"Take them back to the air-lock and shove them out naked one at a time,\"\nhe ordered curtly. \"That's the way they would have treated us. Save the\nyoung bantam for the last. Now, where is this Evan Winford? I have an\nold score to settle with him.\"\n\nUp in his air tunnel Winford nodded grimly to himself. Teutoberg's words\nonly added to the proof that he knew all along that the _Golden Fleece_\nwas in the hands of the Interplanetary marines, for his request for\nWinford revealed that he had been following the helio reports of the\ncapture of the ship by the marines and the stories being broadcast\nthroughout the Universe of how Winford and Jarl and their pirate\ncompanions were being taken with the ship to Mars for piracy and\nexecution.\n\nNeither Commander 6666-A nor his men deigned to answer Teutoberg, but\none of his own men had already discovered that Winford was locked in his\nown stateroom, and he promptly indicated the door.\n\nTeutoberg scowled, drew a pistol in either hand, and strode to the door.\nOne of the men unlocked it, and he kicked it open. He waited\nexpectantly, then advanced cautiously into the room. The sound of his\nbaffled curses filled the passage. Winford grinned mirthlessly.\n\n\"Someone dies for this!\" shouted Teutoberg, storming out into the\npassage. \"Where is he, I say? Bring me that Martian, Jarl! He'll know,\nif anyone does. Bring him, I say, and I'll torture the truth out of his\nbig carcass!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinford's grin vanished. His eyes grew anxious as he waited, tense and\nbreathless, until Jarl, with his big hands lashed together behind his\nback, was brought up from the hold.\n\n\"So we meet again, Jarl?\" jeered Teutoberg, scowling blackly at him.\n\"Where is this master of yours, this Winford?\"\n\nJarl's eyes met Teutoberg's impassively. All too well he knew the innate\ncruelty of this Earthman. Some explanation would have to be made to\nsatisfy him. Never a flicker of an eye-lash revealed what that\nexplanation would be, but Jarl glanced stoically at the empty stateroom.\n\n\"He did it,\" he said calmly.\n\n\"Did what, you clod?\" Teutoberg flung at him savagely.\n\n\"Ended his life as he swore he would.\"\n\n\"Suicide? Impossible! Where is the body?\"\n\n\"He destroyed it together with his life by drinking disintegrator\nconcentrate. He carried a capsule of it when we escaped from Mercury,\nand I've heard him swear time and again that he would die before he\nwould permit himself to be taken back.\"\n\nTeutoberg swallowed the story. There was nothing else to do, apparently.\nHe raved and cursed. Once he raised his pistol to Jarl's heart and\nlowered it again.\n\n\"You'll take his place, Martian dog!\" he snarled. \"By proxy I shall\ntreat him as he deserves, and you shall be the proxy. Back to the hold\nwith you for the present!\"\n\nWith that Teutoberg whirled about, strode up the stairs and vanished in\nthe control room.\n\nCommander 6666-A and his men were dragged aft to the air-lock, leaving\nthe passage near Winford temporarily empty. He broke out the grating and\nwormed his way out of the air tunnel, dropping on the floor hands first.\nHe sprang to his feet, and started grimly up the steps to the control\nroom. Inside that room was Teutoberg, a bigger man than himself, and\narmed, yet Winford, barehanded, cautiously opened the door and stepped\ninside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTeutoberg was standing at one side of the room gazing in rapt attention\nat the slaughter of the helpless marines. One by one he watched them\nemerge from the air-lock bloated and white in their nakedness with their\nconvulsed limbs already growing rigid in the icy cold of space. Out in\nthe open space between the two ships they hung motionless a few minutes,\nthen swiftly dissolved and vanished under the ray of a small\ndisintegrator gun on the liner.\n\nTeutoberg smiled crookedly.\n\nThe door clicked behind him. Teutoberg turned with a startled oath.\nWinford, foul with grime and his clothing torn to rags, stood there.\nTeutoberg's eyes widened. Both hands leaped downward for the holstered\npistols in his belt. At that instant Winford lunged for him.\n\nOne of Teutoberg's hands was now gripping a pistol. Winford struck\nfrenziedly, knocking it from Teutoberg's grasp. The weapon slid under\nthe chart table out of reach. Winford clutched Teutoberg's left hand\nwhich held the still holstered pistol.\n\nSuddenly he saw an advantage, and his heart leaped in exultation. Round\nbehind Teutoberg he pivoted--a wrestling trick he had learned as a boy.\nFor an instant they stood back to back. Then with a mighty effort\nWinford heaved upward relentlessly on his opponent's forearm.\n\nTeutoberg screamed in pain as something snapped in his wrist. The pistol\ndropped from his nerveless fingers. Winford flicked it out of reach\nunder the table with his toe, but had no chance to reach for it, because\nTeutoberg had managed to work himself free.\n\nWith a bellow of animal rage and with arms flailing like wind-mills he\ncharged at Winford again. Winford met his rush with a rapid series of\nblows and Teutoberg went down. But up he came, a wild light in his eyes.\nAgain he went down, only to struggle gamely to his feet once more.\n\nWinford was gasping for breath. It amazed him that Teutoberg could\nendure so much punishment. His arm must be broken and he was terribly\nbattered, yet here he came staggering back for more. Winford now hunched\ndown and, like a crouching animal, advanced slowly toward his enemy.\nSuddenly he started a right almost from the deck straight for\nTeutoberg's chin. It connected. Teutoberg was lifted clear of the deck\nand hurled unconscious against the side of the control room six feet\naway.\n\nWinford staggered to the communication board and his trembling fingers\nclutched the air-lock phone.\n\n\"Hello, hello!\" he gasped. \"Teutoberg speaking. Send no more marines out\nthrough the lock just now.... Yes, of course this is Teutoberg.\"\n\nHe hung the instrument back on its hook and clung dizzily to the edge of\nthe table. At least the slaughter was halted for the time being.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe would have to act fast. He caught up the big water pitcher from the\nholder on the wall where it had miraculously escaped the fight, gulped\ndeeply from it, and splattered water down his face and chest. Then he\npicked up the two pistols from the deck, placed one in his belt and\ngripped the other firmly as he approached the unconscious Teutoberg.\n\nAt the first splash of water in his face Teutoberg groaned and rolled\nover.\n\n\"Get up, you,\" Winford ordered harshly.\n\nTeutoberg sat up groggily. The sight of the pistol and Winford's eyes\nbrought him out with a sudden shock.\n\n\"Get over to that air-lock phone and say just what I tell you to,\"\nordered Winford grimly. \"One false word, and I'll ray you plenty.\"\n\nTeutoberg staggered to his feet obediently and took the phone, for he\nhad read death in Winford's hard eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Jarvis?\" he asked, his body rigid under the prod of Winford's\npistol. \"This is Teutoberg.... Yes, I talked a minute ago. I've changed\nmy plans, Jarvis. We've got to get the iridium out of the hold and into\nthe liner as soon as possible, or we'll be sighted by some other craft.\nTake all the men but ten and go back to the liner. Make ready there for\nthe cargo.... You'll have to clear some cabins; there is more than I\nthought. There isn't much food aboard here, anyway, and it is better to\nlet the men go to mess right away and start transferring the cargo\nimmediately afterward.\"\n\nTeutoberg hung up the phone.\n\n\"Is that satisfactory?\" he asked sullenly.\n\n\"It will do,\" was Winford's terse reply. \"Now when the men have gone\nback to the liner, order two of the remainder to bring up Jarl from the\nhold to the control room here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJarl was as impassive as usual when he entered the control room and\nbeheld Winford in charge there, although his two captors stared in\namazement at Teutoberg, bloody and battered, seated against the side of\nthe room with his hands upraised. Jarl calmly disarmed his two captors\nand closed the door.\n\n\"Only eight of Teutoberg's men besides these remain on the _Golden\nFleece_,\" Winford explained to Jarl. \"Take care of them first, then\nrelease the rest of our men from the hold. Tell Agar to take charge of\nthe machinery as soon as possible, and have the gunners stand by for\nfurther orders.\"\n\n\"Awah,\" replied Jarl stoically, and left the control room.\n\nHe took care of the eight invaders in his very efficient Martian\nfashion, for he pistoled them with neatness and dispatch where they\nstood before the air-lock with the young commander and his remaining two\nmarines, waiting to thrust them out into space. Winford had not\ninstructed Jarl just how to take care of the situation, and the Martian\nattended to it in his own way. Commander 6666-A, with his arms bound\nbehind his back, stared in amazement as Jarl calmly stepped over the\ndead bodies and went on his way to release his fellow pirates from the\nhold.\n\nUp in the control room the radio loud-speaker hummed to life.\n\n\"Teutoberg, Teutoberg, are you there?\" cried an anxious voice. \"Three\nInterplanetary battle spheres are approaching from the direction of the\nEarth! They are still two thousand miles away, but they are coming on\nfast! We're going to cut loose and run for it. If you're not back here\nin five minutes, you'll have to stay where you are!\"\n\nWinford cut in then for Teutoberg, who gulped painfully before speaking.\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" he said in a strained voice. \"I'm staying here on the\n_Golden Fleece_. I'll--I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say you'd meet them in the Hereafter?\" suggested Winford\ncoldly, as he cut out the microphone. \"That's where you are going as\nsoon as Jarl returns. He'll be glad to help you on your way, for he\nhasn't forgotten the aid you gave his brother-in-law in robbing him and\nsending him to Mercury.\"\n\nTeutoberg made no answer.\n\nThings were happening swiftly. Already the liner was lurching forward\nfrantically with every propulsion ray flaming as she started her flight\nthrough space away from the avenging battle spheres. Red lights twinkled\non the control board of the _Golden Fleece_. Agar, at the generators\nnow, threw in the power. The big freighter leaped ahead like a\ngrayhound, soon reaching a speed that even the swift battle spheres\ncould not equal, thanks to the engineering genius of the half-insane\nAgar.\n\nWinford glanced around. Teutoberg was already gone. Jarl had taken him\ndown to the air-lock. Winford tried to forget him. There were other\nthings to think of. There were the details of taking the _Golden Fleece_\nout to Pluto near the frontiers of the Sun's domain--Pluto, that\nstronghold of the space pirates where a man could sell an entire planet\nor any part of it, no questions asked, if he could produce it for the\nbuccaneer kings to bid on. The freighter and its cargo were as good as\nsold already, and the money they would bring would be more than enough\nto buy pardons and freedom for everyone in the crew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were many details to consider carefully, but instead Winford found\nhimself thinking of Teutoberg down by the air-lock, stripped of his\nclothing, ready for his last adventure with life. As much as Winford\nhated the man, he was forced into an unwilling admiration for his dogged\nfight in the control room. A mere word in that telephone would save him.\nWinford shook his head irritably. The man deserved death. Yet again he\nsaw the set features, the final walk into the air-lock. Suddenly Winford\nfound himself at the phone and heard himself giving the order that would\nsave Teutoberg's life. He sat down again, surprised at his own weakness.\nHe was still musing when Jarl entered.\n\n\"You couldn't go through with it,\" observed the big Martian impassively.\n\"I was afraid you couldn't. It is as I have always said of you\nEarthlings. You think you want revenge, good old ancient vengeance; but\nwhen the moment comes and you sit in the high place and can have it, you\nweaken. Well, you won't have to execute Teutoberg now.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Winford.\n\n\"After I received your order and told Teutoberg he wasn't to go out\nthrough the lock after all, he grinned. It was an insult, that grin,\njust as though he knew all along you wouldn't have the nerve to kill\nhim. And while I stood there asking myself if I should not go ahead and\nshove him out anyway, one of his men--one of the two we captured up here\nin this room--caught sight of that grin. He screamed something about\ntreachery and Teutoberg betraying him to the pirates, and before I could\ninterfere he drew a knife and stabbed Teutoberg to death right there\nbefore all of us. After that there was nothing to do but to heave his\nbody into the air-lock and let it go on out into space.\"\n\nFar back across the Void in a tiny space sphere which Winford had given\nhim and his two marines to return to the distant battle sphere,\nLieutenant Commander 6666-A saw through his telescope the white speck of\nTeutoberg's body leave the side of the _Golden Fleece_ and wondered what\nit was.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Space Rover, by Edwin K.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
