FILMER\n\nIn truth the mastery of flying was the work of thousands of men--this\nman a suggestion and that an experiment, until at last only one vigorous\nintellectual effort was needed to finish the work. But the inexorable\ninjustice of the popular mind has decided that of all these thousands,\none man, and that a man who never flew, should be chosen as the\ndiscoverer, just as it has chosen to honour Watt as the discoverer of\nsteam and Stephenson of the steam-engine. And surely of all honoured\nnames none is so grotesquely and tragically honoured as poor Filmer's,\nthe timid, intellectual creature who solved the problem over which the\nworld had hung perplexed and a little fearful for so many generations,\nthe man who pressed the button that has changed peace and warfare and\nwell-nigh every condition of human life and happiness. Never has that\nrecurring wonder of the littleness of the scientific man in the face of\nthe greatness of his science found such an amazing exemplification.\nMuch concerning Filmer is, and must remain, profoundly obscure--Filmers\nattract no Boswells--but the essential facts and the concluding scene\nare clear enough, and there are letters, and notes, and casual allusions\nto piece the whole together. And this is the story one makes, putting\nthis thing with that, of Filmer's life and death.\n\nThe first authentic trace of Filmer on the page of history is a document\nin which he applies for admission as a paid student in physics to the\nGovernment laboratories at South Kensington, and therein he describes\nhimself as the son of a \"military bootmaker\" (\"cobbler\" in the vulgar\ntongue) of Dover, and lists his various examination proofs of a high\nproficiency in chemistry and mathematics. With a certain want of dignity\nhe seeks to enhance these attainments by a profession of poverty and\ndisadvantages, and he writes of the laboratory as the \"gaol\" of his\nambitions, a slip which reinforces his claim to have devoted himself\nexclusively to the exact sciences. The document is endorsed in a manner\nthat shows Filmer was admitted to this coveted opportunity; but until\nquite recently no traces of his success in the Government institution\ncould be found.\n\nIt has now, however, been shown that in spite of his professed zeal\nfor research, Filmer, before he had held this scholarship a year, was\ntempted, by the possibility of a small increase in his immediate income,\nto abandon it in order to become one of the nine-pence-an-hour computers\nemployed by a well-known Professor in his vicarious conduct of those\nextensive researches of his in solar physics--researches which are still\na matter of perplexity to astronomers. Afterwards, for the space of\nseven years, save for the pass lists of the London University, in which\nhe is seen to climb slowly to a double first class B.Sc., in mathematics\nand chemistry, there is no evidence of how Filmer passed his life. No\none knows how or where he lived, though it seems highly probable that he\ncontinued to support himself by teaching while he prosecuted the studies\nnecessary for this distinction. And then, oddly enough, one finds him\nmentioned in the correspondence of Arthur Hicks, the poet.\n\n\"You remember Filmer,\" Hicks writes to his friend Vance; \"well, HE\nhasn't altered a bit, the same hostile mumble and the nasty chin--how\nCAN a man contrive to be always three days from shaving?--and a sort of\nfurtive air of being engaged in sneaking in front of one; even his\ncoat and that frayed collar of his show no further signs of the passing\nyears. He was writing in the library and I sat down beside him in the\nname of God's charity, whereupon he deliberately insulted me by covering\nup his memoranda. It seems he has some brilliant research on hand that\nhe suspects me of all people--with a Bodley Booklet a-printing!--of\nstealing. He has taken remarkable honours at the University--he went\nthrough them with a sort of hasty slobber, as though he feared I might\ninterrupt him before he had told me all--and he spoke of taking his\nD.Sc. as one might speak of taking a cab. And he asked what I was\ndoing--with a sort of comparative accent, and his arm was spread\nnervously, positively a protecting arm, over the paper that hid the\nprecious idea--his one hopeful idea.\n\n\"'Poetry,' he said, 'Poetry. And what do you profess to teach in it,\nHicks?'\n\n\"The thing's a Provincial professorling in the very act of budding, and\nI thank the Lord devoutly that but for the precious gift of indolence I\nalso might have gone this way to D.Sc. and destruction...\"\n\nA curious little vignette that I am inclined to think caught Filmer in\nor near the very birth of his discovery. Hicks was wrong in anticipating\na provincial professorship for Filmer. Our next glimpse of him is\nlecturing on \"rubber and rubber substitutes,\" to the Society of Arts--he\nhad become manager to a great plastic-substance manufactory--and at\nthat time, it is now known, he was a member of the Aeronautical\nSociety, albeit he contributed nothing to the discussions of that body,\npreferring no doubt to mature his great conception without external\nassistance. And within two years of that paper before the Society of\nArts he was hastily taking out a number of patents and proclaiming in\nvarious undignified ways the completion of the divergent inquiries which\nmade his flying machine possible. The first definite statement to that\neffect appeared in a halfpenny evening paper through the agency of a man\nwho lodged in the same house with Filmer. His final haste after his long\nlaborious secret patience seems to have been due to a needless panic,\nBootle, the notorious American scientific quack, having made an\nannouncement that Filmer interpreted wrongly as an anticipation of his\nidea.\n\nNow what precisely was Filmer's idea? Really a very simple one. Before\nhis time the pursuit of aeronautics had taken two divergent lines, and\nhad developed on the one hand balloons--large apparatus lighter than\nair, easy in ascent, and comparatively safe in descent, but floating\nhelplessly before any breeze that took them; and on the other, flying\nmachines that flew only in theory--vast flat structures heavier than\nair, propelled and kept up by heavy engines and for the most part\nsmashing at the first descent. But, neglecting the fact that the\ninevitable final collapse rendered them impossible, the weight of the\nflying machines gave them this theoretical advantage, that they could\ngo through the air against a wind, a necessary condition if aerial\nnavigation was to have any practical value. It is Filmer's particular\nmerit that he perceived the way in which the contrasted and hitherto\nincompatible merits of balloon and heavy flying machine might be\ncombined in one apparatus, which should be at choice either heavier or\nlighter than air. He took hints from the contractile bladders of fish\nand the pneumatic cavities of birds. He devised an arrangement of\ncontractile and absolutely closed balloons which when expanded could\nlift the actual flying apparatus with ease, and when retracted by the\ncomplicated \"musculature\" he wove about them, were withdrawn almost\ncompletely into the frame; and he built the large framework which these\nballoons sustained, of hollow, rigid tubes, the air in which, by an\ningenious contrivance, was automatically pumped out as the apparatus\nfell, and which then remained exhausted so long as the aeronaut desired.\nThere were no wings or propellers to his machine, such as there had been\nto all previous aeroplanes, and the only engine required was the compact\nand powerful little appliance needed to contract the balloons. He\nperceived that such an apparatus as he had devised might rise with frame\nexhausted and balloons expanded to a considerable height, might\nthen contract its balloons and let the air into its frame, and by an\nadjustment of its weights slide down the air in any desired direction.\nAs it fell it would accumulate velocity and at the same time lose\nweight, and the momentum accumulated by its down-rush could be utilised\nby means of a shifting of its weights to drive it up in the air again\nas the balloons expanded. This conception, which is still the structural\nconception of all successful flying machines, needed, however, a vast\namount of toil upon its details before it could actually be\nrealised, and such toil Filmer--as he was accustomed to tell the\nnumerous interviewers who crowded upon him in the heyday of his\nfame--\"ungrudgingly and unsparingly gave.\" His particular difficulty was\nthe elastic lining of the contractile balloon. He found he needed a new\nsubstance, and in the discovery and manufacture of that new substance he\nhad, as he never failed to impress upon the interviewers, \"performed\na far more arduous work than even in the actual achievement of my\nseemingly greater discovery.\"\n\nBut it must not be imagined that these interviews followed hard upon\nFilmer's proclamation of his invention. An interval of nearly five years\nelapsed during which he timidly remained at his rubber factory--he\nseems to have been entirely dependent on his small income from this\nsource--making misdirected attempts to assure a quite indifferent\npublic that he really HAD invented what he had invented. He occupied\nthe greater part of his leisure in the composition of letters to the\nscientific and daily press, and so forth, stating precisely the net\nresult of his contrivances, and demanding financial aid. That alone\nwould have sufficed for the suppression of his letters. He spent such\nholidays as he could arrange in unsatisfactory interviews with the\ndoor-keepers of leading London papers--he was singularly not adapted for\ninspiring hall-porters with confidence--and he positively attempted\nto induce the War Office to take up his work with him. There remains a\nconfidential letter from Major-General Volleyfire to the Earl of Frogs.\n\"The man's a crank and a bounder to boot,\" says the Major-General in\nhis bluff, sensible, army way, and so left it open for the Japanese\nto secure, as they subsequently did, the priority in this side of\nwarfare--a priority they still to our great discomfort retain.\n\nAnd then by a stroke of luck the membrane Filmer had invented for his\ncontractile balloon was discovered to be useful for the valves of a new\noil-engine, and he obtained the means for making a trial model of his\ninvention. He threw up his rubber factory appointment, desisted from all\nfurther writing, and, with a certain secrecy that seems to have been an\ninseparable characteristic of all his proceedings, set to work upon\nthe apparatus. He seems to have directed the making of its parts and\ncollected most of it in a room in Shoreditch, but its final putting\ntogether was done at Dymchurch, in Kent. He did not make the affair\nlarge enough to carry a man, but he made an extremely ingenious use of\nwhat were then called the Marconi rays to control its flight. The first\nflight of this first practicable flying machine took place over some\nfields near Burford Bridge, near Hythe, in Kent, and Filmer followed and\ncontrolled its flight upon a specially constructed motor tricycle.\n\nThe flight was, considering all things, an amazing success. The\napparatus was brought in a cart from Dymchurch to Burford Bridge,\nascended there to a height of nearly three hundred feet, swooped thence\nvery nearly back to Dymchurch, came about in its sweep, rose again,\ncircled, and finally sank uninjured in a field behind the Burford\nBridge Inn. At its descent a curious thing happened. Filmer got off his\ntricycle, scrambled over the intervening dyke, advanced perhaps\ntwenty yards towards his triumph, threw out his arms in a strange\ngesticulation, and fell down in a dead faint. Every one could then\nrecall the ghastliness of his features and all the evidences of extreme\nexcitement they had observed throughout the trial, things they might\notherwise have forgotten. Afterwards in the inn he had an unaccountable\ngust of hysterical weeping.\n\nAltogether there were not twenty witnesses of this affair, and those for\nthe most part uneducated men. The New Romney doctor saw the ascent but\nnot the descent, his horse being frightened by the electrical apparatus\non Filmer's tricycle and giving him a nasty spill. Two members of\nthe Kent constabulary watched the affair from a cart in an unofficial\nspirit, and a grocer calling round the Marsh for orders and two lady\ncyclists seem almost to complete the list of educated people. There were\ntwo reporters present, one representing a Folkestone paper and the\nother being a fourth-class interviewer and \"symposium\" journalist, whose\nexpenses down, Filmer, anxious as ever for adequate advertisement--and\nnow quite realising the way in which adequate advertisement may be\nobtained--had paid. The latter was one of those writers who can throw\na convincing air of unreality over the most credible events, and his\nhalf-facetious account of the affair appeared in the magazine page of\na popular journal. But, happily for Filmer, this person's colloquial\nmethods were more convincing. He went to offer some further screed upon\nthe subject to Banghurst, the proprietor of the New Paper, and one of\nthe ablest and most unscrupulous men in London journalism, and Banghurst\ninstantly seized upon the situation. The interviewer vanishes from\nthe narrative, no doubt very doubtfully remunerated, and Banghurst,\nBanghurst himself, double chin, grey twill suit, abdomen, voice,\ngestures and all, appears at Dymchurch, following his large, unrivalled\njournalistic nose. He had seen the whole thing at a glance, just what it\nwas and what it might be.\n\nAt his touch, as it were, Filmer's long-pent investigations exploded\ninto fame. He instantly and most magnificently was a Boom. One turns\nover the files of the journals of the year 1907 with a quite incredulous\nrecognition of how swift and flaming the boom of those days could be.\nThe July papers know nothing of flying, see nothing in flying, state by\na most effective silence that men never would, could or should fly. In\nAugust flying and Filmer and flying and parachutes and aerial tactics\nand the Japanese Government and Filmer and again flying, shouldered\nthe war in Yunnan and the gold mines of Upper Greenland off the leading\npage. And Banghurst had given ten thousand pounds, and, further,\nBanghurst was giving five thousand pounds, and Banghurst had devoted his\nwell-known, magnificent (but hitherto sterile) private laboratories and\nseveral acres of land near his private residence on the Surrey hills\nto the strenuous and violent completion--Banghurst fashion--of the\nlife-size practicable flying machine. Meanwhile, in the sight of\nprivileged multitudes in the walled-garden of the Banghurst town\nresidence in Fulham, Filmer was exhibited at weekly garden parties\nputting the working model through its paces. At enormous initial cost,\nbut with a final profit, the New Paper presented its readers with a\nbeautiful photographic souvenir of the first of these occasions.\n\nHere again the correspondence of Arthur Hicks and his friend Vance comes\nto our aid.\n\n\"I saw Filmer in his glory,\" he writes, with just the touch of envy\nnatural to his position as a poet passe. \"The man is brushed and shaved,\ndressed in the fashion of a Royal-Institution-Afternoon Lecturer, the\nvery newest shape in frock-coats and long patent shoes, and altogether\nin a state of extraordinary streakiness between an owlish great man and\na scared abashed self-conscious bounder cruelly exposed. He hasn't a\ntouch of colour in the skin of his face, his head juts forward, and\nthose queer little dark amber eyes of his watch furtively round him for\nhis fame. His clothes fit perfectly and yet sit upon him as though he\nhad bought them ready-made. He speaks in a mumble still, but he says,\nyou perceive indistinctly, enormous self-assertive things, he backs into\nthe rear of groups by instinct if Banghurst drops the line for a minute,\nand when he walks across Banghurst's lawn one perceives him a little out\nof breath and going jerky, and that his weak white hands are clenched.\nHis is a state of tension--horrible tension. And he is the Greatest\nDiscoverer of This or Any Age--the Greatest Discoverer of This or Any\nAge! What strikes one so forcibly about him is that he didn't somehow\nquite expect it ever, at any rate, not at all like this. Banghurst is\nabout everywhere, the energetic M.C. of his great little catch, and\nI swear he will have every one down on his lawn there before he has\nfinished with the engine; he had bagged the prime minister yesterday,\nand he, bless his heart! didn't look particularly outsize, on the very\nfirst occasion. Conceive it! Filmer! Our obscure unwashed Filmer, the\nGlory of British science! Duchesses crowd upon him, beautiful, bold\npeeresses say in their beautiful, clear loud voices--have you noticed\nhow penetrating the great lady is becoming nowadays?--'Oh, Mr. Filmer,\nhow DID you do it?'\n\n\"Common men on the edge of things are too remote for the answer. One\nimagines something in the way of that interview, 'toil ungrudgingly\nand unsparingly given, Madam, and, perhaps--I don't know--but perhaps a\nlittle special aptitude.'\"\n\nSo far Hicks, and the photographic supplement to the New Paper is in\nsufficient harmony with the description. In one picture the machine\nswings down towards the river, and the tower of Fulham church appears\nbelow it through a gap in the elms, and in another, Filmer sits at his\nguiding batteries, and the great and beautiful of the earth stand around\nhim, with Banghurst massed modestly but resolutely in the rear. The\ngrouping is oddly apposite. Occluding much of Banghurst, and looking\nwith a pensive, speculative expression at Filmer, stands the Lady Mary\nElkinghorn, still beautiful, in spite of the breath of scandal and her\neight-and-thirty years, the only person whose face does not admit a\nperception of the camera that was in the act of snapping them all.\n\nSo much for the exterior facts of the story, but, after all, they are\nvery exterior facts. About the real interest of the business one is\nnecessarily very much in the dark. How was Filmer feeling at the time?\nHow much was a certain unpleasant anticipation present inside that\nvery new and fashionable frock-coat? He was in the halfpenny, penny,\nsix-penny, and more expensive papers alike, and acknowledged by the\nwhole world as \"the Greatest Discoverer of This or Any Age.\" He had\ninvented a practicable flying machine, and every day down among the\nSurrey hills the life-sized model was getting ready. And when it was\nready, it followed as a clear inevitable consequence of his having\ninvented and made it--everybody in the world, indeed, seemed to take\nit for granted; there wasn't a gap anywhere in that serried front of\nanticipation--that he would proudly and cheerfully get aboard it, ascend\nwith it, and fly.\n\nBut we know now pretty clearly that simple pride and cheerfulness\nin such an act were singularly out of harmony with Filmer's private\nconstitution. It occurred to no one at the time, but there the fact is.\nWe can guess with some confidence now that it must have been drifting\nabout in his mind a great deal during the day, and, from a little\nnote to his physician complaining of persistent insomnia, we have the\nsoundest reason for supposing it dominated his nights,--the idea that it\nwould be after all, in spite of his theoretical security, an abominably\nsickening, uncomfortable, and dangerous thing for him to flap about in\nnothingness a thousand feet or so in the air. It must have dawned upon\nhim quite early in the period of being the Greatest Discoverer of This\nor Any Age, the vision of doing this and that with an extensive void\nbelow. Perhaps somewhen in his youth he had looked down a great height\nor fallen down in some excessively uncomfortable way; perhaps some habit\nof sleeping on the wrong side had resulted in that disagreeable falling\nnightmare one knows, and given him his horror; of the strength of that\nhorror there remains now not a particle of doubt.\n\nApparently he had never weighed this duty of flying in his earlier days\nof research; the machine had been his end, but now things were opening\nout beyond his end, and particularly this giddy whirl up above there. He\nwas a Discoverer and he had Discovered. But he was not a Flying Man, and\nit was only now that he was beginning to perceive clearly that he was\nexpected to fly. Yet, however much the thing was present in his mind he\ngave no expression to it until the very end, and meanwhile he went to\nand fro from Banghurst's magnificent laboratories, and was interviewed\nand lionised, and wore good clothes, and ate good food, and lived in\nan elegant flat, enjoying a very abundant feast of such good, coarse,\nwholesome Fame and Success as a man, starved for all his years as he had\nbeen starved, might be reasonably expected to enjoy.\n\nAfter a time, the weekly gatherings in Fulham ceased. The model had\nfailed one day just for a moment to respond to Filmer's guidance, or he\nhad been distracted by the compliments of an archbishop. At any rate,\nit suddenly dug its nose into the air just a little too steeply as the\narchbishop was sailing through a Latin quotation for all the world like\nan archbishop in a book, and it came down in the Fulham Road within\nthree yards of a 'bus horse. It stood for a second perhaps, astonishing\nand in its attitude astonished, then it crumpled, shivered into pieces,\nand the 'bus horse was incidentally killed.\n\nFilmer lost the end of the archiepiscopal compliment. He stood up and\nstared as his invention swooped out of sight and reach of him. His long,\nwhite hands still gripped his useless apparatus. The archbishop followed\nhis skyward stare with an apprehension unbecoming in an archbishop.\n\nThen came the crash and the shouts and uproar from the road to relieve\nFilmer's tension. \"My God!\" he whispered, and sat down.\n\nEvery one else almost was staring to see where the machine had vanished,\nor rushing into the house.\n\nThe making of the big machine progressed all the more rapidly for this.\nOver its making presided Filmer, always a little slow and very careful\nin his manner, always with a growing preoccupation in his mind. His care\nover the strength and soundness of the apparatus was prodigious. The\nslightest doubt, and he delayed everything until the doubtful part could\nbe replaced. Wilkinson, his senior assistant, fumed at some of these\ndelays, which, he insisted, were for the most part unnecessary.\nBanghurst magnified the patient certitude of Filmer in the New\nPaper, and reviled it bitterly to his wife, and MacAndrew, the second\nassistant, approved Filmer's wisdom. \"We're not wanting a fiasco, man,\"\nsaid MacAndrew. \"He's perfectly well advised.\"\n\nAnd whenever an opportunity arose Filmer would expound to Wilkinson and\nMacAndrew just exactly how every part of the flying machine was to be\ncontrolled and worked, so that in effect they would be just as capable,\nand even more capable, when at last the time came, of guiding it through\nthe skies.\n\nNow I should imagine that if Filmer had seen fit at this stage to define\njust what he was feeling, and to take a definite line in the matter of\nhis ascent, he might have escaped that painful ordeal quite easily. If\nhe had had it clearly in his mind he could have done endless things. He\nwould surely have found no difficulty with a specialist to demonstrate a\nweak heart, or something gastric or pulmonary, to stand in his way--that\nis the line I am astonished he did not take,--or he might, had he been\nman enough, have declared simply and finally that he did not intend to\ndo the thing. But the fact is, though the dread was hugely present in\nhis mind, the thing was by no means sharp and clear. I fancy that all\nthrough this period he kept telling himself that when the occasion came\nhe would find himself equal to it. He was like a man just gripped by a\ngreat illness, who says he feels a little out of sorts, and expects to\nbe better presently. Meanwhile he delayed the completion of the machine,\nand let the assumption that he was going to fly it take root and\nflourish exceedingly about him. He even accepted anticipatory\ncompliments on his courage. And, barring this secret squeamishness,\nthere can be no doubt he found all the praise and distinction and fuss\nhe got a delightful and even intoxicating draught.\n\nThe Lady Mary Elkinghorn made things a little more complicated for him.\n\nHow THAT began was a subject of inexhaustible speculation to Hicks.\nProbably in the beginning she was just a little \"nice\" to him with that\nimpartial partiality of hers, and it may be that to her eyes, standing\nout conspicuously as he did ruling his monster in the upper air, he had\na distinction that Hicks was not disposed to find. And somehow they must\nhave had a moment of sufficient isolation, and the great Discoverer a\nmoment of sufficient courage for something just a little personal to\nbe mumbled or blurted. However it began, there is no doubt that it did\nbegin, and presently became quite perceptible to a world accustomed\nto find in the proceedings of the Lady Mary Elkinghorn a matter of\nentertainment. It complicated things, because the state of love in\nsuch a virgin mind as Filmer's would brace his resolution, if not\nsufficiently, at any rate considerably towards facing a danger he\nfeared, and hampered him in such attempts at evasion as would otherwise\nbe natural and congenial.\n\nIt remains a matter for speculation just how the Lady Mary felt for\nFilmer and just what she thought of him. At thirty-eight one may\nhave gathered much wisdom and still be not altogether wise, and the\nimagination still functions actively enough in creating glamours and\neffecting the impossible. He came before her eyes as a very central man,\nand that always counts, and he had powers, unique powers as it seemed,\nat any rate in the air. The performance with the model had just a touch\nof the quality of a potent incantation, and women have ever displayed an\nunreasonable disposition to imagine that when a man has powers he must\nnecessarily have Power. Given so much, and what was not good in Filmer's\nmanner and appearance became an added merit. He was modest, he hated\ndisplay, but given an occasion where TRUE qualities are needed,\nthen--then one would see!\n\nThe late Mrs. Bampton thought it wise to convey to Lady Mary her opinion\nthat Filmer, all things considered, was rather a \"grub.\" \"He's certainly\nnot a sort of man I have ever met before,\" said the Lady Mary, with a\nquite unruffled serenity. And Mrs. Bampton, after a swift, imperceptible\nglance at that serenity, decided that so far as saying anything to Lady\nMary went, she had done as much as could be expected of her. But she\nsaid a great deal to other people.\n\nAnd at last, without any undue haste or unseemliness, the day dawned,\nthe great day, when Banghurst had promised his public--the world in\nfact--that flying should be finally attained and overcome. Filmer saw it\ndawn, watched even in the darkness before it dawned, watched its stars\nfade and the grey and pearly pinks give place at last to the clear blue\nsky of a sunny, cloudless day. He watched it from the window of his\nbedroom in the new-built wing of Banghurst's Tudor house. And as the\nstars were overwhelmed and the shapes and substances of things grew\ninto being out of the amorphous dark, he must have seen more and more\ndistinctly the festive preparations beyond the beech clumps near the\ngreen pavilion in the outer park, the three stands for the privileged\nspectators, the raw, new fencing of the enclosure, the sheds and\nworkshops, the Venetian masts and fluttering flags that Banghurst had\nconsidered essential, black and limp in the breezeless dawn, and amidst\nall these things a great shape covered with tarpauling. A strange and\nterrible portent for humanity was that shape, a beginning that must\nsurely spread and widen and change and dominate all the affairs of men,\nbut to Filmer it is very doubtful whether it appeared in anything but a\nnarrow and personal light. Several people heard him pacing in the small\nhours--for the vast place was packed with guests by a proprietor editor\nwho, before all understood compression. And about five o'clock, if not\nbefore, Filmer left his room and wandered out of the sleeping house into\nthe park, alive by that time with sunlight and birds and squirrels and\nthe fallow deer. MacAndrew, who was also an early riser, met him near\nthe machine, and they went and had a look at it together.\n\nIt is doubtful if Filmer took any breakfast, in spite of the urgency\nof Banghurst. So soon as the guests began to be about in some number he\nseems to have retreated to his room. Thence about ten he went into the\nshrubbery, very probably because he had seen the Lady Mary Elkinghorn\nthere. She was walking up and down, engaged in conversation with her old\nschool friend, Mrs. Brewis-Craven, and although Filmer had never met the\nlatter lady before, he joined them and walked beside them for some time.\nThere were several silences in spite of the Lady Mary's brilliance. The\nsituation was a difficult one, and Mrs. Brewis-Craven did not master\nits difficulty. \"He struck me,\" she said afterwards with a luminous\nself-contradiction, \"as a very unhappy person who had something to say,\nand wanted before all things to be helped to say it. But how was one to\nhelp him when one didn't know what it was?\"\n\nAt half-past eleven the enclosures for the public in the outer park were\ncrammed, there was an intermittent stream of equipages along the belt\nwhich circles the outer park, and the house party was dotted over the\nlawn and shrubbery and the corner of the inner park, in a series of\nbrilliantly attired knots, all making for the flying machine. Filmer\nwalked in a group of three with Banghurst, who was supremely and\nconspicuously happy, and Sir Theodore Hickle, the president of the\nAeronautical Society. Mrs. Banghurst was close behind with the Lady Mary\nElkinghorn, Georgina Hickle, and the Dean of Stays. Banghurst was large\nand copious in speech, and such interstices as he left were filled in by\nHickle with complimentary remarks to Filmer. And Filmer walked between\nthem saying not a word except by way of unavoidable reply. Behind, Mrs.\nBanghurst listened to the admirably suitable and shapely conversation of\nthe Dean with that fluttered attention to the ampler clergy ten years\nof social ascent and ascendency had not cured in her; and the Lady\nMary watched, no doubt with an entire confidence in the world's\ndisillusionment, the drooping shoulders of the sort of man she had never\nmet before.\n\nThere was some cheering as the central party came into view of the\nenclosures, but it was not very unanimous nor invigorating cheering.\nThey were within fifty yards of the apparatus when Filmer took a hasty\nglance over his shoulder to measure the distance of the ladies behind\nthem, and decided to make the first remark he had initiated since the\nhouse had been left. His voice was just a little hoarse, and he cut in\non Banghurst in mid-sentence on Progress.\n\n\"I say, Banghurst,\" he said, and stopped.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Banghurst.\n\n\"I wish--\" He moistened his lips. \"I'm not feeling well.\"\n\nBanghurst stopped dead. \"Eh?\" he shouted.\n\n\"A queer feeling.\" Filmer made to move on, but Banghurst was immovable.\n\"I don't know. I may be better in a minute. If not--perhaps...\nMacAndrew--\"\n\n\"You're not feeling WELL?\" said Banghurst, and stared at his white face.\n\n\"My dear!\" he said, as Mrs. Banghurst came up with them, \"Filmer says he\nisn't feeling WELL.\"\n\n\"A little queer,\" exclaimed Filmer, avoiding the Lady Mary's eyes. \"It\nmay pass off--\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\nIt came to Filmer that he was the most isolated person in the world.\n\n\"In any case,\" said Banghurst, \"the ascent must be made. Perhaps if you\nwere to sit down somewhere for a moment--\"\n\n\"It's the crowd, I think,\" said Filmer.\n\nThere was a second pause. Banghurst's eye rested in scrutiny on Filmer,\nand then swept the sample of public in the enclosure.\n\n\"It's unfortunate,\" said Sir Theodore Hickle; \"but still--I suppose--Your\nassistants--Of course, if you feel out of condition and disinclined--\"\n\n\"I don't think Mr. Filmer would permit THAT for a moment,\" said Lady\nMary.\n\n\"But if Mr. Filmer's nerve is run--It might even be dangerous for him to\nattempt--\" Hickle coughed.\n\n\"It's just because it's dangerous,\" began the Lady Mary, and felt she\nhad made her point of view and Filmer's plain enough.\n\nConflicting motives struggled for Filmer.\n\n\"I feel I ought to go up,\" he said, regarding the ground. He looked up\nand met the Lady Mary's eyes. \"I want to go up,\" he said, and smiled\nwhitely at her. He turned towards Banghurst. \"If I could just sit down\nsomewhere for a moment out of the crowd and sun--\"\n\nBanghurst, at least, was beginning to understand the case. \"Come into my\nlittle room in the green pavilion,\" he said. \"It's quite cool there.\" He\ntook Filmer by the arm.\n\nFilmer turned his face to the Lady Mary Elkinghorn again. \"I shall be\nall right in five minutes,\" he said. \"I'm tremendously sorry--\"\n\nThe Lady Mary Elkinghorn smiled at him. \"I couldn't think--\" he said to\nHickle, and obeyed the compulsion of Banghurst's pull.\n\nThe rest remained watching the two recede.\n\n\"He is so fragile,\" said the Lady Mary.\n\n\"He's certainly a highly nervous type,\" said the Dean, whose weakness\nit was to regard the whole world, except married clergymen with enormous\nfamilies, as \"neurotic.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Hickle, \"it isn't absolutely necessary for him to go\nup because he has invented--\"\n\n\"How COULD he avoid it?\" asked the Lady Mary, with the faintest shadow\nof scorn.\n\n\"It's certainly most unfortunate if he's going to be ill now,\" said Mrs.\nBanghurst a little severely.\n\n\"He's not going to be ill,\" said the Lady Mary, and certainly she had\nmet Filmer's eye.\n\n\"YOU'LL be all right,\" said Banghurst, as they went towards the\npavilion. \"All you want is a nip of brandy. It ought to be you, you\nknow. You'll be--you'd get it rough, you know, if you let another man--\"\n\n\"Oh, I want to go,\" said Filmer. \"I shall be all right. As a matter of\nfact I'm almost inclined NOW--. No! I think I'll have that nip of brandy\nfirst.\"\n\nBanghurst took him into the little room and routed out an empty\ndecanter. He departed in search of a supply. He was gone perhaps five\nminutes.\n\nThe history of those five minutes cannot be written. At intervals\nFilmer's face could be seen by the people on the easternmost of the\nstands erected for spectators, against the window pane peering out, and\nthen it would recede and fade. Banghurst vanished shouting behind the\ngrand stand, and presently the butler appeared going pavilionward with a\ntray.\n\nThe apartment in which Filmer came to his last solution was a pleasant\nlittle room very simply furnished with green furniture and an old\nbureau--for Banghurst was simple in all his private ways. It was hung\nwith little engravings after Morland and it had a shelf of books. But as\nit happened, Banghurst had left a rook rifle he sometimes played with on\nthe top of the desk, and on the corner of the mantelshelf was a tin with\nthree or four cartridges remaining in it. As Filmer went up and down\nthat room wrestling with his intolerable dilemma he went first towards\nthe neat little rifle athwart the blotting-pad and then towards the neat\nlittle red label\n\n\".22 LONG.\"\n\nThe thing must have jumped into his mind in a moment.\n\nNobody seems to have connected the report with him, though the gun,\nbeing fired in a confined space, must have sounded loud, and there\nwere several people in the billiard-room, separated from him only by a\nlath-and-plaster partition. But directly Banghurst's butler opened the\ndoor and smelt the sour smell of the smoke, he knew, he says, what had\nhappened. For the servants at least of Banghurst's household had guessed\nsomething of what was going on in Filmer's mind.\n\nAll through that trying afternoon Banghurst behaved as he held a man\nshould behave in the presence of hopeless disaster, and his guests\nfor the most part succeeded in not insisting upon the fact--though to\nconceal their perception of it altogether was impossible--that Banghurst\nhad been pretty elaborately and completely swindled by the deceased. The\npublic in the enclosure, Hicks told me, dispersed \"like a party that has\nbeen ducking a welsher,\" and there wasn't a soul in the train to London,\nit seems, who hadn't known all along that flying was a quite impossible\nthing for man. \"But he might have tried it,\" said many, \"after carrying\nthe thing so far.\"\n\nIn the evening, when he was comparatively alone, Banghurst broke down\nand went on like a man of clay. I have been told he wept, which must\nhave made an imposing scene, and he certainly said Filmer had ruined\nhis life, and offered and sold the whole apparatus to MacAndrew for\nhalf-a-crown. \"I've been thinking--\" said MacAndrew at the conclusion of\nthe bargain, and stopped.\n\nThe next morning the name of Filmer was, for the first time, less\nconspicuous in the New Paper than in any other daily paper in the world.\nThe rest of the world's instructors, with varying emphasis, according to\ntheir dignity and the degree of competition between themselves and the\nNew Paper, proclaimed the \"Entire Failure of the New Flying Machine,\"\nand \"Suicide of the Impostor.\" But in the district of North Surrey the\nreception of the news was tempered by a perception of unusual aerial\nphenomena.\n\nOvernight Wilkinson and MacAndrew had fallen into violent argument on\nthe exact motives of their principal's rash act.\n\n\"The man was certainly a poor, cowardly body, but so far as his science\nwent he was NO impostor,\" said MacAndrew, \"and I'm prepared to give that\nproposition a very practical demonstration, Mr. Wilkinson, so soon as\nwe've got the place a little more to ourselves. For I've no faith in all\nthis publicity for experimental trials.\"\n\nAnd to that end, while all the world was reading of the certain failure\nof the new flying machine, MacAndrew was soaring and curvetting with\ngreat amplitude and dignity over the Epsom and Wimbledon divisions;\nand Banghurst, restored once more to hope and energy, and regardless of\npublic security and the Board of Trade, was pursuing his gyrations and\ntrying to attract his attention, on a motor car and in his pyjamas--he\nhad caught sight of the ascent when pulling up the blind of his bedroom\nwindow--equipped, among other things, with a film camera that was\nsubsequently discovered to be jammed. And Filmer was lying on the\nbilliard table in the green pavilion with a sheet about his body.\n\n\n\n\n2. THE MAGIC SHOP\n\nI had seen the Magic Shop from afar several times; I had passed it once\nor twice, a shop window of alluring little objects, magic balls, magic\nhens, wonderful cones, ventriloquist dolls, the material of the basket\ntrick, packs of cards that LOOKED all right, and all that sort of\nthing, but never had I thought of going in until one day, almost without\nwarning, Gip hauled me by my finger right up to the window, and so\nconducted himself that there was nothing for it but to take him in. I\nhad not thought the place was there, to tell the truth--a modest-sized\nfrontage in Regent Street, between the picture shop and the place where\nthe chicks run about just out of patent incubators, but there it was\nsure enough. I had fancied it was down nearer the Circus, or round the\ncorner in Oxford Street, or even in Holborn; always over the way and\na little inaccessible it had been, with something of the mirage in its\nposition; but here it was now quite indisputably, and the fat end of\nGip's pointing finger made a noise upon the glass.\n\n\"If I was rich,\" said Gip, dabbing a finger at the Disappearing Egg,\n\"I'd buy myself that. And that\"--which was The Crying Baby, Very\nHuman--\"and that,\" which was a mystery, and called, so a neat card\nasserted, \"Buy One and Astonish Your Friends.\"\n\n\"Anything,\" said Gip, \"will disappear under one of those cones. I have\nread about it in a book.\n\n\"And there, dadda, is the Vanishing Halfpenny--, only they've put it\nthis way up so's we can't see how it's done.\"\n\nGip, dear boy, inherits his mother's breeding, and he did not propose to\nenter the shop or worry in any way; only, you know, quite unconsciously\nhe lugged my finger doorward, and he made his interest clear.\n\n\"That,\" he said, and pointed to the Magic Bottle.\n\n\"If you had that?\" I said; at which promising inquiry he looked up with\na sudden radiance.\n\n\"I could show it to Jessie,\" he said, thoughtful as ever of others.\n\n\"It's less than a hundred days to your birthday, Gibbles,\" I said, and\nlaid my hand on the door-handle.\n\nGip made no answer, but his grip tightened on my finger, and so we came\ninto the shop.\n\nIt was no common shop this; it was a magic shop, and all the prancing\nprecedence Gip would have taken in the matter of mere toys was wanting.\nHe left the burthen of the conversation to me.\n\nIt was a little, narrow shop, not very well lit, and the door-bell\npinged again with a plaintive note as we closed it behind us. For a\nmoment or so we were alone and could glance about us. There was a tiger\nin papier-mache on the glass case that covered the low counter--a grave,\nkind-eyed tiger that waggled his head in a methodical manner; there were\nseveral crystal spheres, a china hand holding magic cards, a stock\nof magic fish-bowls in various sizes, and an immodest magic hat that\nshamelessly displayed its springs. On the floor were magic mirrors; one\nto draw you out long and thin, one to swell your head and vanish your\nlegs, and one to make you short and fat like a draught; and while we\nwere laughing at these the shopman, as I suppose, came in.\n\nAt any rate, there he was behind the counter--a curious, sallow, dark\nman, with one ear larger than the other and a chin like the toe-cap of a\nboot.\n\n\"What can we have the pleasure?\" he said, spreading his long, magic\nfingers on the glass case; and so with a start we were aware of him.\n\n\"I want,\" I said, \"to buy my little boy a few simple tricks.\"\n\n\"Legerdemain?\" he asked. \"Mechanical? Domestic?\"\n\n\"Anything amusing?\" said I.\n\n\"Um!\" said the shopman, and scratched his head for a moment as if\nthinking. Then, quite distinctly, he drew from his head a glass ball.\n\"Something in this way?\" he said, and held it out.\n\nThe action was unexpected. I had seen the trick done at entertainments\nendless times before--it's part of the common stock of conjurers--but I\nhad not expected it here.\n\n\"That's good,\" I said, with a laugh.\n\n\"Isn't it?\" said the shopman.\n\nGip stretched out his disengaged hand to take this object and found\nmerely a blank palm.\n\n\"It's in your pocket,\" said the shopman, and there it was!\n\n\"How much will that be?\" I asked.\n\n\"We make no charge for glass balls,\" said the shopman politely. \"We get\nthem,\"--he picked one out of his elbow as he spoke--\"free.\" He produced\nanother from the back of his neck, and laid it beside its predecessor on\nthe counter. Gip regarded his glass ball sagely, then directed a look\nof inquiry at the two on the counter, and finally brought his round-eyed\nscrutiny to the shopman, who smiled.\n\n\"You may have those too,\" said the shopman, \"and, if you DON'T mind, one\nfrom my mouth. SO!\"\n\nGip counselled me mutely for a moment, and then in a profound silence\nput away the four balls, resumed my reassuring finger, and nerved\nhimself for the next event.\n\n\"We get all our smaller tricks in that way,\" the shopman remarked.\n\nI laughed in the manner of one who subscribes to a jest. \"Instead of\ngoing to the wholesale shop,\" I said. \"Of course, it's cheaper.\"\n\n\"In a way,\" the shopman said. \"Though we pay in the end. But not\nso heavily--as people suppose.... Our larger tricks, and our daily\nprovisions and all the other things we want, we get out of that\nhat... And you know, sir, if you'll excuse my saying it, there ISN'T a\nwholesale shop, not for Genuine Magic goods, sir. I don't know if\nyou noticed our inscription--the Genuine Magic shop.\" He drew a\nbusiness-card from his cheek and handed it to me. \"Genuine,\" he\nsaid, with his finger on the word, and added, \"There is absolutely no\ndeception, sir.\"\n\nHe seemed to be carrying out the joke pretty thoroughly, I thought.\n\nHe turned to Gip with a smile of remarkable affability. \"You, you know,\nare the Right Sort of Boy.\"\n\nI was surprised at his knowing that, because, in the interests of\ndiscipline, we keep it rather a secret even at home; but Gip received it\nin unflinching silence, keeping a steadfast eye on him.\n\n\"It's only the Right Sort of Boy gets through that doorway.\"\n\nAnd, as if by way of illustration, there came a rattling at the door,\nand a squeaking little voice could be faintly heard. \"Nyar! I WARN 'a go\nin there, dadda, I WARN 'a go in there. Ny-a-a-ah!\" and then the accents\nof a down-trodden parent, urging consolations and propitiations. \"It's\nlocked, Edward,\" he said.\n\n\"But it isn't,\" said I.\n\n\"It is, sir,\" said the shopman, \"always--for that sort of child,\" and as\nhe spoke we had a glimpse of the other youngster, a little, white face,\npallid from sweet-eating and over-sapid food, and distorted by evil\npassions, a ruthless little egotist, pawing at the enchanted pane.\n\"It's no good, sir,\" said the shopman, as I moved, with my natural\nhelpfulness, doorward, and presently the spoilt child was carried off\nhowling.\n\n\"How do you manage that?\" I said, breathing a little more freely.\n\n\"Magic!\" said the shopman, with a careless wave of the hand, and behold!\nsparks of coloured fire flew out of his fingers and vanished into the\nshadows of the shop.\n\n\"You were saying,\" he said, addressing himself to Gip, \"before you came\nin, that you would like one of our 'Buy One and Astonish your Friends'\nboxes?\"\n\nGip, after a gallant effort, said \"Yes.\"\n\n\"It's in your pocket.\"\n\nAnd leaning over the counter--he really had an extraordinarily long\nbody--this amazing person produced the article in the customary\nconjurer's manner. \"Paper,\" he said, and took a sheet out of the empty\nhat with the springs; \"string,\" and behold his mouth was a string-box,\nfrom which he drew an unending thread, which when he had tied his parcel\nhe bit off--and, it seemed to me, swallowed the ball of string. And then\nhe lit a candle at the nose of one of the ventriloquist's dummies, stuck\none of his fingers (which had become sealing-wax red) into the flame,\nand so sealed the parcel. \"Then there was the Disappearing Egg,\" he\nremarked, and produced one from within my coat-breast and packed it, and\nalso The Crying Baby, Very Human. I handed each parcel to Gip as it was\nready, and he clasped them to his chest.\n\nHe said very little, but his eyes were eloquent; the clutch of his arms\nwas eloquent. He was the playground of unspeakable emotions. These,\nyou know, were REAL Magics. Then, with a start, I discovered something\nmoving about in my hat--something soft and jumpy. I whipped it off, and\na ruffled pigeon--no doubt a confederate--dropped out and ran on the\ncounter, and went, I fancy, into a cardboard box behind the papier-mache\ntiger.\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" said the shopman, dexterously relieving me of my headdress;\n\"careless bird, and--as I live--nesting!\"\n\nHe shook my hat, and shook out into his extended hand two or three eggs,\na large marble, a watch, about half-a-dozen of the inevitable glass\nballs, and then crumpled, crinkled paper, more and more and more,\ntalking all the time of the way in which people neglect to brush their\nhats INSIDE as well as out, politely, of course, but with a certain\npersonal application. \"All sorts of things accumulate, sir.... Not YOU,\nof course, in particular.... Nearly every customer.... Astonishing what\nthey carry about with them....\" The crumpled paper rose and billowed on\nthe counter more and more and more, until he was nearly hidden from us,\nuntil he was altogether hidden, and still his voice went on and on. \"We\nnone of us know what the fair semblance of a human being may conceal,\nsir. Are we all then no better than brushed exteriors, whited\nsepulchres--\"\n\nHis voice stopped--exactly like when you hit a neighbour's gramophone\nwith a well-aimed brick, the same instant silence, and the rustle of the\npaper stopped, and everything was still....\n\n\"Have you done with my hat?\" I said, after an interval.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nI stared at Gip, and Gip stared at me, and there were our distortions in\nthe magic mirrors, looking very rum, and grave, and quiet....\n\n\"I think we'll go now,\" I said. \"Will you tell me how much all this\ncomes to?....\n\n\"I say,\" I said, on a rather louder note, \"I want the bill; and my hat,\nplease.\"\n\nIt might have been a sniff from behind the paper pile....\n\n\"Let's look behind the counter, Gip,\" I said. \"He's making fun of us.\"\n\nI led Gip round the head-wagging tiger, and what do you think there\nwas behind the counter? No one at all! Only my hat on the floor, and a\ncommon conjurer's lop-eared white rabbit lost in meditation, and looking\nas stupid and crumpled as only a conjurer's rabbit can do. I resumed my\nhat, and the rabbit lolloped a lollop or so out of my way.\n\n\"Dadda!\" said Gip, in a guilty whisper.\n\n\"What is it, Gip?\" said I.\n\n\"I DO like this shop, dadda.\"\n\n\"So should I,\" I said to myself, \"if the counter wouldn't suddenly\nextend itself to shut one off from the door.\" But I didn't call Gip's\nattention to that. \"Pussy!\" he said, with a hand out to the rabbit as it\ncame lolloping past us; \"Pussy, do Gip a magic!\" and his eyes followed\nit as it squeezed through a door I had certainly not remarked a moment\nbefore. Then this door opened wider, and the man with one ear larger\nthan the other appeared again. He was smiling still, but his eye met\nmine with something between amusement and defiance. \"You'd like to see\nour show-room, sir,\" he said, with an innocent suavity. Gip tugged\nmy finger forward. I glanced at the counter and met the shopman's eye\nagain. I was beginning to think the magic just a little too genuine.\n\"We haven't VERY much time,\" I said. But somehow we were inside the\nshow-room before I could finish that.\n\n\"All goods of the same quality,\" said the shopman, rubbing his flexible\nhands together, \"and that is the Best. Nothing in the place that isn't\ngenuine Magic, and warranted thoroughly rum. Excuse me, sir!\"\n\nI felt him pull at something that clung to my coat-sleeve, and then\nI saw he held a little, wriggling red demon by the tail--the little\ncreature bit and fought and tried to get at his hand--and in a moment\nhe tossed it carelessly behind a counter. No doubt the thing was only an\nimage of twisted indiarubber, but for the moment--! And his gesture was\nexactly that of a man who handles some petty biting bit of vermin. I\nglanced at Gip, but Gip was looking at a magic rocking-horse. I was\nglad he hadn't seen the thing. \"I say,\" I said, in an undertone, and\nindicating Gip and the red demon with my eyes, \"you haven't many things\nlike THAT about, have you?\"\n\n\"None of ours! Probably brought it with you,\" said the shopman--also\nin an undertone, and with a more dazzling smile than ever. \"Astonishing\nwhat people WILL carry about with them unawares!\" And then to Gip, \"Do\nyou see anything you fancy here?\"\n\nThere were many things that Gip fancied there.\n\nHe turned to this astonishing tradesman with mingled confidence and\nrespect. \"Is that a Magic Sword?\" he said.\n\n\"A Magic Toy Sword. It neither bends, breaks, nor cuts the fingers. It\nrenders the bearer invincible in battle against any one under eighteen.\nHalf-a-crown to seven and sixpence, according to size. These panoplies\non cards are for juvenile knights-errant and very useful--shield of\nsafety, sandals of swiftness, helmet of invisibility.\"\n\n\"Oh, daddy!\" gasped Gip.\n\nI tried to find out what they cost, but the shopman did not heed me.\nHe had got Gip now; he had got him away from my finger; he had embarked\nupon the exposition of all his confounded stock, and nothing was going\nto stop him. Presently I saw with a qualm of distrust and something very\nlike jealousy that Gip had hold of this person's finger as usually he\nhas hold of mine. No doubt the fellow was interesting, I thought,\nand had an interestingly faked lot of stuff, really GOOD faked stuff,\nstill--\n\nI wandered after them, saying very little, but keeping an eye on this\nprestidigital fellow. After all, Gip was enjoying it. And no doubt when\nthe time came to go we should be able to go quite easily.\n\nIt was a long, rambling place, that show-room, a gallery broken up\nby stands and stalls and pillars, with archways leading off to other\ndepartments, in which the queerest-looking assistants loafed and stared\nat one, and with perplexing mirrors and curtains. So perplexing, indeed,\nwere these that I was presently unable to make out the door by which we\nhad come.\n\nThe shopman showed Gip magic trains that ran without steam or clockwork,\njust as you set the signals, and then some very, very valuable boxes of\nsoldiers that all came alive directly you took off the lid and said--. I\nmyself haven't a very quick ear and it was a tongue-twisting sound,\nbut Gip--he has his mother's ear--got it in no time. \"Bravo!\" said the\nshopman, putting the men back into the box unceremoniously and handing\nit to Gip. \"Now,\" said the shopman, and in a moment Gip had made them\nall alive again.\n\n\"You'll take that box?\" asked the shopman.\n\n\"We'll take that box,\" said I, \"unless you charge its full value. In\nwhich case it would need a Trust Magnate--\"\n\n\"Dear heart! NO!\" and the shopman swept the little men back again, shut\nthe lid, waved the box in the air, and there it was, in brown paper,\ntied up and--WITH GIP'S FULL NAME AND ADDRESS ON THE PAPER!\n\nThe shopman laughed at my amazement.\n\n\"This is the genuine magic,\" he said. \"The real thing.\"\n\n\"It's a little too genuine for my taste,\" I said again.\n\nAfter that he fell to showing Gip tricks, odd tricks, and still odder\nthe way they were done. He explained them, he turned them inside out,\nand there was the dear little chap nodding his busy bit of a head in the\nsagest manner.\n\nI did not attend as well as I might. \"Hey, presto!\" said the Magic\nShopman, and then would come the clear, small \"Hey, presto!\" of the boy.\nBut I was distracted by other things. It was being borne in upon me just\nhow tremendously rum this place was; it was, so to speak, inundated by\na sense of rumness. There was something a little rum about the fixtures\neven, about the ceiling, about the floor, about the casually distributed\nchairs. I had a queer feeling that whenever I wasn't looking at them\nstraight they went askew, and moved about, and played a noiseless\npuss-in-the-corner behind my back. And the cornice had a serpentine\ndesign with masks--masks altogether too expressive for proper plaster.\n\nThen abruptly my attention was caught by one of the odd-looking\nassistants. He was some way off and evidently unaware of my presence--I\nsaw a sort of three-quarter length of him over a pile of toys and\nthrough an arch--and, you know, he was leaning against a pillar in an\nidle sort of way doing the most horrid things with his features! The\nparticular horrid thing he did was with his nose. He did it just as\nthough he was idle and wanted to amuse himself. First of all it was a\nshort, blobby nose, and then suddenly he shot it out like a telescope,\nand then out it flew and became thinner and thinner until it was like\na long, red, flexible whip. Like a thing in a nightmare it was! He\nflourished it about and flung it forth as a fly-fisher flings his line.\n\nMy instant thought was that Gip mustn't see him. I turned about, and\nthere was Gip quite preoccupied with the shopman, and thinking no evil.\nThey were whispering together and looking at me. Gip was standing on\na little stool, and the shopman was holding a sort of big drum in his\nhand.\n\n\"Hide and seek, dadda!\" cried Gip. \"You're He!\"\n\nAnd before I could do anything to prevent it, the shopman had clapped\nthe big drum over him. I saw what was up directly. \"Take that off,\" I\ncried, \"this instant! You'll frighten the boy. Take it off!\"\n\nThe shopman with the unequal ears did so without a word, and held the\nbig cylinder towards me to show its emptiness. And the little stool was\nvacant! In that instant my boy had utterly disappeared?...\n\nYou know, perhaps, that sinister something that comes like a hand out\nof the unseen and grips your heart about. You know it takes your common\nself away and leaves you tense and deliberate, neither slow nor hasty,\nneither angry nor afraid. So it was with me.\n\nI came up to this grinning shopman and kicked his stool aside.\n\n\"Stop this folly!\" I said. \"Where is my boy?\"\n\n\"You see,\" he said, still displaying the drum's interior, \"there is no\ndeception---\"\n\nI put out my hand to grip him, and he eluded me by a dexterous movement.\nI snatched again, and he turned from me and pushed open a door to\nescape. \"Stop!\" I said, and he laughed, receding. I leapt after\nhim--into utter darkness.\n\nTHUD!\n\n\"Lor' bless my 'eart! I didn't see you coming, sir!\"\n\nI was in Regent Street, and I had collided with a decent-looking working\nman; and a yard away, perhaps, and looking a little perplexed with\nhimself, was Gip. There was some sort of apology, and then Gip had\nturned and come to me with a bright little smile, as though for a moment\nhe had missed me.\n\nAnd he was carrying four parcels in his arm!\n\nHe secured immediate possession of my finger.\n\nFor the second I was rather at a loss. I stared round to see the door\nof the magic shop, and, behold, it was not there! There was no door, no\nshop, nothing, only the common pilaster between the shop where they sell\npictures and the window with the chicks!...\n\nI did the only thing possible in that mental tumult; I walked straight\nto the kerbstone and held up my umbrella for a cab.\n\n\"'Ansoms,\" said Gip, in a note of culminating exultation.\n\nI helped him in, recalled my address with an effort, and got in also.\nSomething unusual proclaimed itself in my tail-coat pocket, and I felt\nand discovered a glass ball. With a petulant expression I flung it into\nthe street.\n\nGip said nothing.\n\nFor a space neither of us spoke.\n\n\"Dada!\" said Gip, at last, \"that WAS a proper shop!\"\n\nI came round with that to the problem of just how the whole thing had\nseemed to him. He looked completely undamaged--so far, good; he was\nneither scared nor unhinged, he was simply tremendously satisfied with\nthe afternoon's entertainment, and there in his arms were the four\nparcels.\n\nConfound it! what could be in them?\n\n\"Um!\" I said. \"Little boys can't go to shops like that every day.\"\n\nHe received this with his usual stoicism, and for a moment I was sorry I\nwas his father and not his mother, and so couldn't suddenly there, coram\npublico, in our hansom, kiss him. After all, I thought, the thing wasn't\nso very bad.\n\nBut it was only when we opened the parcels that I really began to be\nreassured. Three of them contained boxes of soldiers, quite ordinary\nlead soldiers, but of so good a quality as to make Gip altogether forget\nthat originally these parcels had been Magic Tricks of the only genuine\nsort, and the fourth contained a kitten, a little living white kitten,\nin excellent health and appetite and temper.\n\nI saw this unpacking with a sort of provisional relief. I hung about in\nthe nursery for quite an unconscionable time....\n\nThat happened six months ago. And now I am beginning to believe it is\nall right. The kitten had only the magic natural to all kittens, and\nthe soldiers seem as steady a company as any colonel could desire. And\nGip--?\n\nThe intelligent parent will understand that I have to go cautiously with\nGip.\n\nBut I went so far as this one day. I said, \"How would you like your\nsoldiers to come alive, Gip, and march about by themselves?\"\n\n\"Mine do,\" said Gip. \"I just have to say a word I know before I open the\nlid.\"\n\n\"Then they march about alone?\"\n\n\"Oh, QUITE, dadda. I shouldn't like them if they didn't do that.\"\n\nI displayed no unbecoming surprise, and since then I have taken occasion\nto drop in upon him once or twice, unannounced, when the soldiers were\nabout, but so far I have never discovered them performing in anything\nlike a magical manner.\n\nIt's so difficult to tell.\n\nThere's also a question of finance. I have an incurable habit of paying\nbills. I have been up and down Regent Street several times, looking for\nthat shop. I am inclined to think, indeed, that in that matter honour is\nsatisfied, and that, since Gip's name and address are known to them, I\nmay very well leave it to these people, whoever they may be, to send in\ntheir bill in their own time.\n\n\n\n\n3. THE VALLEY OF SPIDERS\n\nTowards mid-day the three pursuers came abruptly round a bend in the\ntorrent bed upon the sight of a very broad and spacious valley. The\ndifficult and winding trench of pebbles along which they had tracked\nthe fugitives for so long, expanded to a broad slope, and with a common\nimpulse the three men left the trail, and rode to a little eminence set\nwith olive-dun trees, and there halted, the two others, as became them,\na little behind the man with the silver-studded bridle.\n\nFor a space they scanned the great expanse below them with eager eyes.\nIt spread remoter and remoter, with only a few clusters of sere thorn\nbushes here and there, and the dim suggestions of some now waterless\nravine, to break its desolation of yellow grass. Its purple distances\nmelted at last into the bluish slopes of the further hills--hills it\nmight be of a greener kind--and above them invisibly supported, and\nseeming indeed to hang in the blue, were the snowclad summits of\nmountains that grew larger and bolder to the north-westward as the sides\nof the valley drew together. And westward the valley opened until a\ndistant darkness under the sky told where the forests began. But the\nthree men looked neither east nor west, but only steadfastly across the\nvalley.\n\nThe gaunt man with the scarred lip was the first to speak. \"Nowhere,\" he\nsaid, with a sigh of disappointment in his voice. \"But after all, they\nhad a full day's start.\"\n\n\"They don't know we are after them,\" said the little man on the white\nhorse.\n\n\"SHE would know,\" said the leader bitterly, as if speaking to himself.\n\n\"Even then they can't go fast. They've got no beast but the mule, and\nall to-day the girl's foot has been bleeding---\"\n\nThe man with the silver bridle flashed a quick intensity of rage on him.\n\"Do you think I haven't seen that?\" he snarled.\n\n\"It helps, anyhow,\" whispered the little man to himself.\n\nThe gaunt man with the scarred lip stared impassively. \"They can't be\nover the valley,\" he said. \"If we ride hard--\"\n\nHe glanced at the white horse and paused.\n\n\"Curse all white horses!\" said the man with the silver bridle, and\nturned to scan the beast his curse included.\n\nThe little man looked down between the melancholy ears of his steed.\n\n\"I did my best,\" he said.\n\nThe two others stared again across the valley for a space. The gaunt man\npassed the back of his hand across the scarred lip.\n\n\"Come up!\" said the man who owned the silver bridle, suddenly. The\nlittle man started and jerked his rein, and the horse hoofs of the three\nmade a multitudinous faint pattering upon the withered grass as they\nturned back towards the trail....\n\nThey rode cautiously down the long slope before them, and so came\nthrough a waste of prickly, twisted bushes and strange dry shapes of\nhorny branches that grew amongst the rocks, into the levels below.\nAnd there the trail grew faint, for the soil was scanty, and the only\nherbage was this scorched dead straw that lay upon the ground. Still, by\nhard scanning, by leaning beside the horses' necks and pausing ever and\nagain, even these white men could contrive to follow after their prey.\n\nThere were trodden places, bent and broken blades of the coarse grass,\nand ever and again the sufficient intimation of a footmark. And once\nthe leader saw a brown smear of blood where the half-caste girl may have\ntrod. And at that under his breath he cursed her for a fool.\n\nThe gaunt man checked his leader's tracking, and the little man on the\nwhite horse rode behind, a man lost in a dream. They rode one after\nanother, the man with the silver bridle led the way, and they spoke\nnever a word. After a time it came to the little man on the white horse\nthat the world was very still. He started out of his dream. Besides the\nlittle noises of their horses and equipment, the whole great valley kept\nthe brooding quiet of a painted scene.\n\nBefore him went his master and his fellow, each intently leaning forward\nto the left, each impassively moving with the paces of his horse; their\nshadows went before them--still, noiseless, tapering attendants; and\nnearer a crouched cool shape was his own. He looked about him. What was\nit had gone? Then he remembered the reverberation from the banks of the\ngorge and the perpetual accompaniment of shifting, jostling pebbles.\nAnd, moreover--? There was no breeze. That was it! What a vast, still\nplace it was, a monotonous afternoon slumber. And the sky open and\nblank, except for a sombre veil of haze that had gathered in the upper\nvalley.\n\nHe straightened his back, fretted with his bridle, puckered his lips\nto whistle, and simply sighed. He turned in his saddle for a time, and\nstared at the throat of the mountain gorge out of which they had come.\nBlank! Blank slopes on either side, with never a sign of a decent beast\nor tree--much less a man. What a land it was! What a wilderness! He\ndropped again into his former pose.\n\nIt filled him with a momentary pleasure to see a wry stick of purple\nblack flash out into the form of a snake, and vanish amidst the brown.\nAfter all, the infernal valley WAS alive. And then, to rejoice him still\nmore, came a little breath across his face, a whisper that came and\nwent, the faintest inclination of a stiff black-antlered bush upon a\nlittle crest, the first intimations of a possible breeze. Idly he wetted\nhis finger, and held it up.\n\nHe pulled up sharply to avoid a collision with the gaunt man, who had\nstopped at fault upon the trail. Just at that guilty moment he caught\nhis master's eye looking towards him.\n\nFor a time he forced an interest in the tracking. Then, as they rode on\nagain, he studied his master's shadow and hat and shoulder, appearing\nand disappearing behind the gaunt man's nearer contours. They had ridden\nfour days out of the very limits of the world into this desolate place,\nshort of water, with nothing but a strip of dried meat under their\nsaddles, over rocks and mountains, where surely none but these fugitives\nhad ever been before--for THAT!\n\nAnd all this was for a girl, a mere wilful child! And the man had whole\ncityfuls of people to do his basest bidding--girls, women! Why in the\nname of passionate folly THIS one in particular? asked the little man,\nand scowled at the world, and licked his parched lips with a blackened\ntongue. It was the way of the master, and that was all he knew. Just\nbecause she sought to evade him....\n\nHis eye caught a whole row of high plumed canes bending in unison, and\nthen the tails of silk that hung before his neck flapped and fell. The\nbreeze was growing stronger. Somehow it took the stiff stillness out of\nthings--and that was well.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said the gaunt man.\n\nAll three stopped abruptly.\n\n\"What?\" asked the master. \"What?\"\n\n\"Over there,\" said the gaunt man, pointing up the valley.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Something coming towards us.\"\n\nAnd as he spoke a yellow animal crested a rise and came bearing down\nupon them. It was a big wild dog, coming before the wind, tongue out, at\na steady pace, and running with such an intensity of purpose that he\ndid not seem to see the horsemen he approached. He ran with his nose up,\nfollowing, it was plain, neither scent nor quarry. As he drew nearer the\nlittle man felt for his sword. \"He's mad,\" said the gaunt rider.\n\n\"Shout!\" said the little man, and shouted.\n\nThe dog came on. Then when the little man's blade was already out, it\nswerved aside and went panting by them and past. The eyes of the little\nman followed its flight. \"There was no foam,\" he said. For a space the\nman with the silver-studded bridle stared up the valley. \"Oh, come\non!\" he cried at last. \"What does it matter?\" and jerked his horse into\nmovement again.\n\nThe little man left the insoluble mystery of a dog that fled from\nnothing but the wind, and lapsed into profound musings on human\ncharacter. \"Come on!\" he whispered to himself. \"Why should it be given\nto one man to say 'Come on!' with that stupendous violence of effect.\nAlways, all his life, the man with the silver bridle has been saying\nthat. If _I_ said it--!\" thought the little man. But people marvelled\nwhen the master was disobeyed even in the wildest things. This\nhalf-caste girl seemed to him, seemed to every one, mad--blasphemous\nalmost. The little man, by way of comparison, reflected on the gaunt\nrider with the scarred lip, as stalwart as his master, as brave and,\nindeed, perhaps braver, and yet for him there was obedience, nothing but\nto give obedience duly and stoutly...\n\nCertain sensations of the hands and knees called the little man back to\nmore immediate things. He became aware of something. He rode up beside\nhis gaunt fellow. \"Do you notice the horses?\" he said in an undertone.\n\nThe gaunt face looked interrogation.\n\n\"They don't like this wind,\" said the little man, and dropped behind as\nthe man with the silver bridle turned upon him.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said the gaunt-faced man.\n\nThey rode on again for a space in silence. The foremost two rode\ndowncast upon the trail, the hindmost man watched the haze that crept\ndown the vastness of the valley, nearer and nearer, and noted how the\nwind grew in strength moment by moment. Far away on the left he saw a\nline of dark bulks--wild hog perhaps, galloping down the valley, but of\nthat he said nothing, nor did he remark again upon the uneasiness of the\nhorses.\n\nAnd then he saw first one and then a second great white ball, a great\nshining white ball like a gigantic head of thistle-down, that drove\nbefore the wind athwart the path. These balls soared high in the air,\nand dropped and rose again and caught for a moment, and hurried on\nand passed, but at the sight of them the restlessness of the horses\nincreased.\n\nThen presently he saw that more of these drifting globes--and then soon\nvery many more--were hurrying towards him down the valley.\n\nThey became aware of a squealing. Athwart the path a huge boar rushed,\nturning his head but for one instant to glance at them, and then hurling\non down the valley again. And at that, all three stopped and sat in\ntheir saddles, staring into the thickening haze that was coming upon\nthem.\n\n\"If it were not for this thistle-down--\" began the leader.\n\nBut now a big globe came drifting past within a score of yards of them.\nIt was really not an even sphere at all, but a vast, soft, ragged, filmy\nthing, a sheet gathered by the corners, an aerial jelly-fish, as it\nwere, but rolling over and over as it advanced, and trailing long,\ncobwebby threads and streamers that floated in its wake.\n\n\"It isn't thistle-down,\" said the little man.\n\n\"I don't like the stuff,\" said the gaunt man.\n\nAnd they looked at one another.\n\n\"Curse it!\" cried the leader. \"The air's full of it up there. If it\nkeeps on at this pace long, it will stop us altogether.\"\n\nAn instinctive feeling, such as lines out a herd of deer at the approach\nof some ambiguous thing, prompted them to turn their horses to the wind,\nride forward for a few paces, and stare at that advancing multitude\nof floating masses. They came on before the wind with a sort of smooth\nswiftness, rising and falling noiselessly, sinking to earth, rebounding\nhigh, soaring--all with a perfect unanimity, with a still, deliberate\nassurance.\n\nRight and left of the horsemen the pioneers of this strange army passed.\nAt one that rolled along the ground, breaking shapelessly and trailing\nout reluctantly into long grappling ribbons and bands, all three horses\nbegan to shy and dance. The master was seized with a sudden unreasonable\nimpatience. He cursed the drifting globes roundly. \"Get on!\" he cried;\n\"get on! What do these things matter? How CAN they matter? Back to\nthe trail!\" He fell swearing at his horse and sawed the bit across its\nmouth.\n\nHe shouted aloud with rage. \"I will follow that trail, I tell you!\" he\ncried. \"Where is the trail?\"\n\nHe gripped the bridle of his prancing horse and searched amidst the\ngrass. A long and clinging thread fell across his face, a grey streamer\ndropped about his bridle-arm, some big, active thing with many legs ran\ndown the back of his head. He looked up to discover one of those grey\nmasses anchored as it were above him by these things and flapping out\nends as a sail flaps when a boat comes, about--but noiselessly.\n\nHe had an impression of many eyes, of a dense crew of squat bodies, of\nlong, many-jointed limbs hauling at their mooring ropes to bring the\nthing down upon him. For a space he stared up, reining in his prancing\nhorse with the instinct born of years of horsemanship. Then the flat\nof a sword smote his back, and a blade flashed overhead and cut the\ndrifting balloon of spider-web free, and the whole mass lifted softly\nand drove clear and away.\n\n\"Spiders!\" cried the voice of the gaunt man. \"The things are full of big\nspiders! Look, my lord!\"\n\nThe man with the silver bridle still followed the mass that drove away.\n\n\"Look, my lord!\"\n\nThe master found himself staring down at a red, smashed thing on the\nground that, in spite of partial obliteration, could still wriggle\nunavailing legs. Then when the gaunt man pointed to another mass that\nbore down upon them, he drew his sword hastily. Up the valley now it was\nlike a fog bank torn to rags. He tried to grasp the situation.\n\n\"Ride for it!\" the little man was shouting. \"Ride for it down the\nvalley.\"\n\nWhat happened then was like the confusion of a battle. The man with\nthe silver bridle saw the little man go past him slashing furiously at\nimaginary cobwebs, saw him cannon into the horse of the gaunt man and\nhurl it and its rider to earth. His own horse went a dozen paces before\nhe could rein it in. Then he looked up to avoid imaginary dangers, and\nthen back again to see a horse rolling on the ground, the gaunt man\nstanding and slashing over it at a rent and fluttering mass of grey that\nstreamed and wrapped about them both. And thick and fast as thistle-down\non waste land on a windy day in July, the cobweb masses were coming on.\n\nThe little man had dismounted, but he dared not release his horse. He\nwas endeavouring to lug the struggling brute back with the strength of\none arm, while with the other he slashed aimlessly, The tentacles of a\nsecond grey mass had entangled themselves with the struggle, and this\nsecond grey mass came to its moorings, and slowly sank.\n\nThe master set his teeth, gripped his bridle, lowered his head, and\nspurred his horse forward. The horse on the ground rolled over, there\nwere blood and moving shapes upon the flanks, and the gaunt man,\nsuddenly leaving it, ran forward towards his master, perhaps ten paces.\nHis legs were swathed and encumbered with grey; he made ineffectual\nmovements with his sword. Grey streamers waved from him; there was\na thin veil of grey across his face. With his left hand he beat at\nsomething on his body, and suddenly he stumbled and fell. He struggled\nto rise, and fell again, and suddenly, horribly, began to howl,\n\"Oh--ohoo, ohooh!\"\n\nThe master could see the great spiders upon him, and others upon the\nground.\n\nAs he strove to force his horse nearer to this gesticulating, screaming\ngrey object that struggled up and down, there came a clatter of hoofs,\nand the little man, in act of mounting, swordless, balanced on his belly\nathwart the white horse, and clutching its mane, whirled past. And again\na clinging thread of grey gossamer swept across the master's face.\nAll about him, and over him, it seemed this drifting, noiseless cobweb\ncircled and drew nearer him....\n\nTo the day of his death he never knew just how the event of that moment\nhappened. Did he, indeed, turn his horse, or did it really of its own\naccord stampede after its fellow? Suffice it that in another second\nhe was galloping full tilt down the valley with his sword whirling\nfuriously overhead. And all about him on the quickening breeze, the\nspiders' airships, their air bundles and air sheets, seemed to him to\nhurry in a conscious pursuit.\n\nClatter, clatter, thud, thud--the man with the silver bridle rode,\nheedless of his direction, with his fearful face looking up now right,\nnow left, and his sword arm ready to slash. And a few hundred yards\nahead of him, with a tail of torn cobweb trailing behind him, rode the\nlittle man on the white horse, still but imperfectly in the saddle.\nThe reeds bent before them, the wind blew fresh and strong, over his\nshoulder the master could see the webs hurrying to overtake....\n\nHe was so intent to escape the spiders' webs that only as his horse\ngathered together for a leap did he realise the ravine ahead. And then\nhe realised it only to misunderstand and interfere. He was leaning\nforward on his horse's neck and sat up and back all too late.\n\nBut if in his excitement he had failed to leap, at any rate he had not\nforgotten how to fall. He was horseman again in mid-air. He came off\nclear with a mere bruise upon his shoulder, and his horse rolled,\nkicking spasmodic legs, and lay still. But the master's sword drove its\npoint into the hard soil, and snapped clean across, as though Chance\nrefused him any longer as her Knight, and the splintered end missed his\nface by an inch or so.\n\nHe was on his feet in a moment, breathlessly scanning the onrushing\nspider-webs. For a moment he was minded to run, and then thought of the\nravine, and turned back. He ran aside once to dodge one drifting terror,\nand then he was swiftly clambering down the precipitous sides, and out\nof the touch of the gale.\n\nThere under the lee of the dry torrent's steeper banks he might crouch,\nand watch these strange, grey masses pass and pass in safety till the\nwind fell, and it became possible to escape. And there for a long time\nhe crouched, watching the strange, grey, ragged masses trail their\nstreamers across his narrowed sky.\n\nOnce a stray spider fell into the ravine close beside him--a full foot\nit measured from leg to leg, and its body was half a man's hand--and\nafter he had watched its monstrous alacrity of search and escape for a\nlittle while, and tempted it to bite his broken sword, he lifted up his\niron-heeled boot and smashed it into a pulp. He swore as he did so, and\nfor a time sought up and down for another.\n\nThen presently, when he was surer these spider swarms could not drop\ninto the ravine, he found a place where he could sit down, and sat and\nfell into deep thought and began after his manner to gnaw his knuckles\nand bite his nails. And from this he was moved by the coming of the man\nwith the white horse.\n\nHe heard him long before he saw him, as a clattering of hoofs, stumbling\nfootsteps, and a reassuring voice. Then the little man appeared, a\nrueful figure, still with a tail of white cobweb trailing behind him.\nThey approached each other without speaking, without a salutation. The\nlittle man was fatigued and shamed to the pitch of hopeless bitterness,\nand came to a stop at last, face to face with his seated master. The\nlatter winced a little under his dependant's eye. \"Well?\" he said at\nlast, with no pretence of authority.\n\n\"You left him?\"\n\n\"My horse bolted.\"\n\n\"I know. So did mine.\"\n\nHe laughed at his master mirthlessly.\n\n\"I say my horse bolted,\" said the man who once had a silver-studded\nbridle.\n\n\"Cowards both,\" said the little man.\n\nThe other gnawed his knuckle through some meditative moments, with his\neye on his inferior.\n\n\"Don't call me a coward,\" he said at length.\n\n\"You are a coward like myself.\"\n\n\"A coward possibly. There is a limit beyond which every man must fear.\nThat I have learnt at last. But not like yourself. That is where the\ndifference comes in.\"\n\n\"I never could have dreamt you would have left him. He saved your life\ntwo minutes before.... Why are you our lord?\"\n\nThe master gnawed his knuckles again, and his countenance was dark.\n\n\"No man calls me a coward,\" he said. \"No. A broken sword is better than\nnone.... One spavined white horse cannot be expected to carry two men\na four days' journey. I hate white horses, but this time it cannot be\nhelped. You begin to understand me?... I perceive that you are minded,\non the strength of what you have seen and fancy, to taint my reputation.\nIt is men of your sort who unmake kings. Besides which--I never liked\nyou.\"\n\n\"My lord!\" said the little man.\n\n\"No,\" said the master. \"NO!\"\n\nHe stood up sharply as the little man moved. For a minute perhaps they\nfaced one another. Overhead the spiders' balls went driving. There was a\nquick movement among the pebbles; a running of feet, a cry of despair, a\ngasp and a blow....\n\nTowards nightfall the wind fell. The sun set in a calm serenity, and\nthe man who had once possessed the silver bridle came at last very\ncautiously and by an easy slope out of the ravine again; but now he led\nthe white horse that once belonged to the little man. He would have gone\nback to his horse to get his silver-mounted bridle again, but he feared\nnight and a quickening breeze might still find him in the valley, and\nbesides he disliked greatly to think he might discover his horse all\nswathed in cobwebs and perhaps unpleasantly eaten.\n\nAnd as he thought of those cobwebs and of all the dangers he had been\nthrough, and the manner in which he had been preserved that day, his\nhand sought a little reliquary that hung about his neck, and he clasped\nit for a moment with heartfelt gratitude. As he did so his eyes went\nacross the valley.\n\n\"I was hot with passion,\" he said, \"and now she has met her reward. They\nalso, no doubt--\"\n\nAnd behold! Far away out of the wooded slopes across the valley, but in\nthe clearness of the sunset distinct and unmistakable, he saw a little\nspire of smoke.\n\nAt that his expression of serene resignation changed to an amazed anger.\nSmoke? He turned the head of the white horse about, and hesitated. And\nas he did so a little rustle of air went through the grass about him.\nFar away upon some reeds swayed a tattered sheet of grey. He looked at\nthe cobwebs; he looked at the smoke.\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, it is not them,\" he said at last.\n\nBut he knew better.\n\nAfter he had stared at the smoke for some time, he mounted the white\nhorse.\n\nAs he rode, he picked his way amidst stranded masses of web. For some\nreason there were many dead spiders on the ground, and those that lived\nfeasted guiltily on their fellows. At the sound of his horse's hoofs\nthey fled.\n\nTheir time had passed. From the ground without either a wind to carry\nthem or a winding sheet ready, these things, for all their poison, could\ndo him little evil. He flicked with his belt at those he fancied came\ntoo near. Once, where a number ran together over a bare place, he was\nminded to dismount and trample them with his boots, but this impulse he\novercame. Ever and again he turned in his saddle, and looked back at the\nsmoke.\n\n\"Spiders,\" he muttered over and over again. \"Spiders! Well, well.... The\nnext time I must spin a web.\"\n\n\n\n\n4. THE TRUTH ABOUT PYECRAFT\n\nHe sits not a dozen yards away. If I glance over my shoulder I can see\nhim. And if I catch his eye--and usually I catch his eye--it meets me\nwith an expression.\n\nIt is mainly an imploring look--and yet with suspicion in it.\n\nConfound his suspicion! If I wanted to tell on him I should have told\nlong ago. I don't tell and I don't tell, and he ought to feel at his\nease. As if anything so gross and fat as he could feel at ease! Who\nwould believe me if I did tell?\n\nPoor old Pyecraft! Great, uneasy jelly of substance! The fattest clubman\nin London.\n\nHe sits at one of the little club tables in the huge bay by the fire,\nstuffing. What is he stuffing? I glance judiciously and catch him biting\nat a round of hot buttered tea-cake, with his eyes on me. Confound\nhim!--with his eyes on me!\n\nThat settles it, Pyecraft! Since you WILL be abject, since you WILL\nbehave as though I was not a man of honour, here, right under your\nembedded eyes, I write the thing down--the plain truth about Pyecraft.\nThe man I helped, the man I shielded, and who has requited me by making\nmy club unendurable, absolutely unendurable, with his liquid appeal,\nwith the perpetual \"don't tell\" of his looks.\n\nAnd, besides, why does he keep on eternally eating?\n\nWell, here goes for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\ntruth!\n\nPyecraft--. I made the acquaintance of Pyecraft in this very\nsmoking-room. I was a young, nervous new member, and he saw it. I was\nsitting all alone, wishing I knew more of the members, and suddenly\nhe came, a great rolling front of chins and abdomina, towards me, and\ngrunted and sat down in a chair close by me and wheezed for a space, and\nscraped for a space with a match and lit a cigar, and then addressed\nme. I forget what he said--something about the matches not lighting\nproperly, and afterwards as he talked he kept stopping the waiters one\nby one as they went by, and telling them about the matches in that thin,\nfluty voice he has. But, anyhow, it was in some such way we began our\ntalking.\n\nHe talked about various things and came round to games. And thence to\nmy figure and complexion. \"YOU ought to be a good cricketer,\" he said. I\nsuppose I am slender, slender to what some people would call lean, and\nI suppose I am rather dark, still--I am not ashamed of having a Hindu\ngreat-grandmother, but, for all that, I don't want casual strangers to\nsee through me at a glance to HER. So that I was set against Pyecraft\nfrom the beginning.\n\nBut he only talked about me in order to get to himself.\n\n\"I expect,\" he said, \"you take no more exercise than I do, and probably\nyou eat no less.\" (Like all excessively obese people he fancied he ate\nnothing.) \"Yet,\"--and he smiled an oblique smile--\"we differ.\"\n\nAnd then he began to talk about his fatness and his fatness; all he did\nfor his fatness and all he was going to do for his fatness; what people\nhad advised him to do for his fatness and what he had heard of people\ndoing for fatness similar to his. \"A priori,\" he said, \"one would think\na question of nutrition could be answered by dietary and a question of\nassimilation by drugs.\" It was stifling. It was dumpling talk. It made\nme feel swelled to hear him.\n\nOne stands that sort of thing once in a way at a club, but a time came\nwhen I fancied I was standing too much. He took to me altogether too\nconspicuously. I could never go into the smoking-room but he would come\nwallowing towards me, and sometimes he came and gormandised round and\nabout me while I had my lunch. He seemed at times almost to be clinging\nto me. He was a bore, but not so fearful a bore as to be limited to me;\nand from the first there was something in his manner--almost as though\nhe knew, almost as though he penetrated to the fact that I MIGHT--that\nthere was a remote, exceptional chance in me that no one else presented.\n\n\"I'd give anything to get it down,\" he would say--\"anything,\" and peer\nat me over his vast cheeks and pant.\n\nPoor old Pyecraft! He has just gonged, no doubt to order another\nbuttered tea-cake!\n\nHe came to the actual thing one day. \"Our Pharmacopoeia,\" he said, \"our\nWestern Pharmacopoeia, is anything but the last word of medical science.\nIn the East, I've been told--\"\n\nHe stopped and stared at me. It was like being at an aquarium.\n\nI was quite suddenly angry with him. \"Look here,\" I said, \"who told you\nabout my great-grandmother's recipes?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he fenced.\n\n\"Every time we've met for a week,\" I said, \"and we've met pretty\noften--you've given me a broad hint or so about that little secret of\nmine.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"now the cat's out of the bag, I'll admit, yes, it is\nso. I had it--\"\n\n\"From Pattison?\"\n\n\"Indirectly,\" he said, which I believe was lying, \"yes.\"\n\n\"Pattison,\" I said, \"took that stuff at his own risk.\"\n\nHe pursed his mouth and bowed.\n\n\"My great-grandmother's recipes,\" I said, \"are queer things to handle.\nMy father was near making me promise--\"\n\n\"He didn't?\"\n\n\"No. But he warned me. He himself used one--once.\"\n\n\"Ah!... But do you think--? Suppose--suppose there did happen to be\none--\"\n\n\"The things are curious documents,\" I said.\n\n\"Even the smell of 'em.... No!\"\n\nBut after going so far Pyecraft was resolved I should go farther. I was\nalways a little afraid if I tried his patience too much he would fall\non me suddenly and smother me. I own I was weak. But I was also annoyed\nwith Pyecraft. I had got to that state of feeling for him that disposed\nme to say, \"Well, TAKE the risk!\" The little affair of Pattison to which\nI have alluded was a different matter altogether. What it was doesn't\nconcern us now, but I knew, anyhow, that the particular recipe I used\nthen was safe. The rest I didn't know so much about, and, on the whole,\nI was inclined to doubt their safety pretty completely.\n\nYet even if Pyecraft got poisoned--\n\nI must confess the poisoning of Pyecraft struck me as an immense\nundertaking.\n\nThat evening I took that queer, odd-scented sandalwood box out of my\nsafe and turned the rustling skins over. The gentleman who wrote the\nrecipes for my great-grandmother evidently had a weakness for skins of\na miscellaneous origin, and his handwriting was cramped to the last\ndegree. Some of the things are quite unreadable to me--though my family,\nwith its Indian Civil Service associations, has kept up a knowledge of\nHindustani from generation to generation--and none are absolutely plain\nsailing. But I found the one that I knew was there soon enough, and sat\non the floor by my safe for some time looking at it.\n\n\"Look here,\" said I to Pyecraft next day, and snatched the slip away\nfrom his eager grasp.\n\n\"So far as I--can make it out, this is a recipe for Loss of Weight.\n(\"Ah!\" said Pyecraft.) I'm not absolutely sure, but I think it's that.\nAnd if you take my advice you'll leave it alone. Because, you know--I\nblacken my blood in your interest, Pyecraft--my ancestors on that side\nwere, so far as I can gather, a jolly queer lot. See?\"\n\n\"Let me try it,\" said Pyecraft.\n\nI leant back in my chair. My imagination made one mighty effort and\nfell flat within me. \"What in Heaven's name, Pyecraft,\" I asked, \"do you\nthink you'll look like when you get thin?\"\n\nHe was impervious to reason. I made him promise never to say a word to\nme about his disgusting fatness again whatever happened--never, and then\nI handed him that little piece of skin.\n\n\"It's nasty stuff,\" I said.\n\n\"No matter,\" he said, and took it.\n\nHe goggled at it. \"But--but--\" he said.\n\nHe had just discovered that it wasn't English.\n\n\"To the best of my ability,\" I said, \"I will do you a translation.\"\n\nI did my best. After that we didn't speak for a fortnight. Whenever\nhe approached me I frowned and motioned him away, and he respected our\ncompact, but at the end of a fortnight he was as fat as ever. And then\nhe got a word in.\n\n\"I must speak,\" he said. \"It isn't fair. There's something wrong. It's\ndone me no good. You're not doing your great-grandmother justice.\"\n\n\"Where's the recipe?\"\n\nHe produced it gingerly from his pocket-book.\n\nI ran my eye over the items. \"Was the egg addled?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. Ought it to have been?\"\n\n\"That,\" I said, \"goes without saying in all my poor dear\ngreat-grandmother's recipes. When condition or quality is not specified\nyou must get the worst. She was drastic or nothing.... And there's one\nor two possible alternatives to some of these other things. You got\nFRESH rattlesnake venom.\"\n\n\"I got a rattlesnake from Jamrach's. It cost--it cost--\"\n\n\"That's your affair, anyhow. This last item--\"\n\n\"I know a man who--\"\n\n\"Yes. H'm. Well, I'll write the alternatives down. So far as I know\nthe language, the spelling of this recipe is particularly atrocious.\nBy-the-bye, dog here probably means pariah dog.\"\n\nFor a month after that I saw Pyecraft constantly at the club and as\nfat and anxious as ever. He kept our treaty, but at times he broke\nthe spirit of it by shaking his head despondently. Then one day in the\ncloakroom he said, \"Your great-grandmother--\"\n\n\"Not a word against her,\" I said; and he held his peace.\n\nI could have fancied he had desisted, and I saw him one day talking to\nthree new members about his fatness as though he was in search of other\nrecipes. And then, quite unexpectedly, his telegram came.\n\n\"Mr. Formalyn!\" bawled a page-boy under my nose, and I took the telegram\nand opened it at once.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake come.--Pyecraft.\"\n\n\"H'm,\" said I, and to tell the truth I was so pleased at the\nrehabilitation of my great grandmother's reputation this evidently\npromised that I made a most excellent lunch.\n\nI got Pyecraft's address from the hall porter. Pyecraft inhabited the\nupper half of a house in Bloomsbury, and I went there so soon as I had\ndone my coffee and Trappistine. I did not wait to finish my cigar.\n\n\"Mr. Pyecraft?\" said I, at the front door.\n\nThey believed he was ill; he hadn't been out for two days.\n\n\"He expects me,\" said I, and they sent me up.\n\nI rang the bell at the lattice-door upon the landing.\n\n\"He shouldn't have tried it, anyhow,\" I said to myself. \"A man who eats\nlike a pig ought to look like a pig.\"\n\nAn obviously worthy woman, with an anxious face and a carelessly placed\ncap, came and surveyed me through the lattice.\n\nI gave my name and she let me in in a dubious fashion.\n\n\"Well?\" said I, as we stood together inside Pyecraft's piece of the\nlanding.\n\n\"'E said you was to come in if you came,\" she said, and regarded me,\nmaking no motion to show me anywhere. And then, confidentially, \"'E's\nlocked in, sir.\"\n\n\"Locked in?\"\n\n\"Locked himself in yesterday morning and 'asn't let any one in since,\nsir. And ever and again SWEARING. Oh, my!\"\n\nI stared at the door she indicated by her glances.\n\n\"In there?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What's up?\"\n\nShe shook her head sadly, \"'E keeps on calling for vittles, sir. 'EAVY\nvittles 'e wants. I get 'im what I can. Pork 'e's 'ad, sooit puddin',\nsossiges, noo bread. Everythink like that. Left outside, if you please,\nand me go away. 'E's eatin', sir, somethink AWFUL.\"\n\nThere came a piping bawl from inside the door: \"That Formalyn?\"\n\n\"That you, Pyecraft?\" I shouted, and went and banged the door.\n\n\"Tell her to go away.\"\n\nI did.\n\nThen I could hear a curious pattering upon the door, almost like some\none feeling for the handle in the dark, and Pyecraft's familiar grunts.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I said, \"she's gone.\"\n\nBut for a long time the door didn't open.\n\nI heard the key turn. Then Pyecraft's voice said, \"Come in.\"\n\nI turned the handle and opened the door. Naturally I expected to see\nPyecraft.\n\nWell, you know, he wasn't there!\n\nI never had such a shock in my life. There was his sitting-room in a\nstate of untidy disorder, plates and dishes among the books and writing\nthings, and several chairs overturned, but Pyecraft--\n\n\"It's all right, o' man; shut the door,\" he said, and then I discovered\nhim.\n\nThere he was right up close to the cornice in the corner by the door, as\nthough some one had glued him to the ceiling. His face was anxious and\nangry. He panted and gesticulated. \"Shut the door,\" he said. \"If that\nwoman gets hold of it--\"\n\nI shut the door, and went and stood away from him and stared.\n\n\"If anything gives way and you tumble down,\" I said, \"you'll break your\nneck, Pyecraft.\"\n\n\"I wish I could,\" he wheezed.\n\n\"A man of your age and weight getting up to kiddish gymnastics--\"\n\n\"Don't,\" he said, and looked agonised.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" he said, and gesticulated.\n\n\"How the deuce,\" said I, \"are you holding on up there?\"\n\nAnd then abruptly I realised that he was not holding on at all, that he\nwas floating up there--just as a gas-filled bladder might have floated\nin the same position. He began a struggle to thrust himself away\nfrom the ceiling and to clamber down the wall to me. \"It's that\nprescription,\" he panted, as he did so. \"Your great-gran--\"\n\nHe took hold of a framed engraving rather carelessly as he spoke and\nit gave way, and he flew back to the ceiling again, while the picture\nsmashed onto the sofa. Bump he went against the ceiling, and I knew then\nwhy he was all over white on the more salient curves and angles of his\nperson. He tried again more carefully, coming down by way of the mantel.\n\nIt was really a most extraordinary spectacle, that great, fat,\napoplectic-looking man upside down and trying to get from the ceiling to\nthe floor. \"That prescription,\" he said. \"Too successful.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Loss of weight--almost complete.\"\n\nAnd then, of course, I understood.\n\n\"By Jove, Pyecraft,\" said I, \"what you wanted was a cure for fatness!\nBut you always called it weight. You would call it weight.\"\n\nSomehow I was extremely delighted. I quite liked Pyecraft for the time.\n\"Let me help you!\" I said, and took his hand and pulled him down. He\nkicked about, trying to get a foothold somewhere. It was very like\nholding a flag on a windy day.\n\n\"That table,\" he said, pointing, \"is solid mahogany and very heavy. If\nyou can put me under that---\"\n\nI did, and there he wallowed about like a captive balloon, while I stood\non his hearthrug and talked to him.\n\nI lit a cigar. \"Tell me,\" I said, \"what happened?\"\n\n\"I took it,\" he said.\n\n\"How did it taste?\"\n\n\"Oh, BEASTLY!\"\n\nI should fancy they all did. Whether one regards the ingredients or\nthe probable compound or the possible results, almost all of my\ngreat-grandmother's remedies appear to me at least to be extraordinarily\nuninviting. For my own part--\n\n\"I took a little sip first.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"And as I felt lighter and better after an hour, I decided to take the\ndraught.\"\n\n\"My dear Pyecraft!\"\n\n\"I held my nose,\" he explained. \"And then I kept on getting lighter and\nlighter--and helpless, you know.\"\n\nHe gave way to a sudden burst of passion. \"What the goodness am I to\nDO?\" he said.\n\n\"There's one thing pretty evident,\" I said, \"that you mustn't do. If you\ngo out of doors, you'll go up and up.\" I waved an arm upward. \"They'd\nhave to send Santos-Dumont after you to bring you down again.\"\n\n\"I suppose it will wear off?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I don't think you can count on that,\" I said.\n\nAnd then there was another burst of passion, and he kicked out at\nadjacent chairs and banged the floor. He behaved just as I should\nhave expected a great, fat, self-indulgent man to behave under trying\ncircumstances--that is to say, very badly. He spoke of me and my\ngreat-grandmother with an utter want of discretion.\n\n\"I never asked you to take the stuff,\" I said.\n\nAnd generously disregarding the insults he was putting upon me, I sat\ndown in his armchair and began to talk to him in a sober, friendly\nfashion.\n\nI pointed out to him that this was a trouble he had brought upon\nhimself, and that it had almost an air of poetical justice. He had eaten\ntoo much. This he disputed, and for a time we argued the point.\n\nHe became noisy and violent, so I desisted from this aspect of his\nlesson. \"And then,\" said I, \"you committed the sin of euphuism. You\ncalled it not Fat, which is just and inglorious, but Weight. You--\"\n\nHe interrupted to say he recognised all that. What was he to DO?\n\nI suggested he should adapt himself to his new conditions. So we came to\nthe really sensible part of the business. I suggested that it would\nnot be difficult for him to learn to walk about on the ceiling with his\nhands--\n\n\"I can't sleep,\" he said.\n\nBut that was no great difficulty. It was quite possible, I pointed out,\nto make a shake-up under a wire mattress, fasten the under things on\nwith tapes, and have a blanket, sheet, and coverlet to button at the\nside. He would have to confide in his housekeeper, I said; and after\nsome squabbling he agreed to that. (Afterwards it was quite delightful\nto see the beautifully matter-of-fact way with which the good lady took\nall these amazing inversions.) He could have a library ladder in his\nroom, and all his meals could be laid on the top of his bookcase. We\nalso hit on an ingenious device by which he could get to the floor\nwhenever he wanted, which was simply to put the British Encyclopaedia\n(tenth edition) on the top of his open shelves. He just pulled out a\ncouple of volumes and held on, and down he came. And we agreed there\nmust be iron staples along the skirting, so that he could cling to those\nwhenever he wanted to get about the room on the lower level.\n\nAs we got on with the thing I found myself almost keenly interested. It\nwas I who called in the housekeeper and broke matters to her, and it was\nI chiefly who fixed up the inverted bed. In fact, I spent two whole days\nat his flat. I am a handy, interfering sort of man with a screw-driver,\nand I made all sorts of ingenious adaptations for him--ran a wire to\nbring his bells within reach, turned all his electric lights up\ninstead of down, and so on. The whole affair was extremely curious and\ninteresting to me, and it was delightful to think of Pyecraft like some\ngreat, fat blow-fly, crawling about on his ceiling and clambering round\nthe lintels of his doors from one room to another, and never, never,\nnever coming to the club any more....\n\nThen, you know, my fatal ingenuity got the better of me. I was sitting\nby his fire drinking his whisky, and he was up in his favourite corner\nby the cornice, tacking a Turkey carpet to the ceiling, when the\nidea struck me. \"By Jove, Pyecraft!\" I said, \"all this is totally\nunnecessary.\"\n\nAnd before I could calculate the complete consequences of my notion I\nblurted it out. \"Lead underclothing,\" said I, and the mischief was done.\n\nPyecraft received the thing almost in tears. \"To be right ways up\nagain--\" he said. I gave him the whole secret before I saw where it\nwould take me. \"Buy sheet lead,\" I said, \"stamp it into discs. Sew 'em\nall over your underclothes until you have enough. Have lead-soled boots,\ncarry a bag of solid lead, and the thing is done! Instead of being a\nprisoner here you may go abroad again, Pyecraft; you may travel--\"\n\nA still happier idea came to me. \"You need never fear a shipwreck.\nAll you need do is just slip off some or all of your clothes, take the\nnecessary amount of luggage in your hand, and float up in the air--\"\n\nIn his emotion he dropped the tack-hammer within an ace of my head. \"By\nJove!\" he said, \"I shall be able to come back to the club again.\"\n\nThe thing pulled me up short. \"By Jove!\" I said faintly. \"Yes. Of\ncourse--you will.\"\n\nHe did. He does. There he sits behind me now, stuffing--as I\nlive!--a third go of buttered tea-cake. And no one in the whole world\nknows--except his housekeeper and me--that he weighs practically\nnothing; that he is a mere boring mass of assimilatory matter, mere\nclouds in clothing, niente, nefas, the most inconsiderable of men. There\nhe sits watching until I have done this writing. Then, if he can, he\nwill waylay me. He will come billowing up to me....\n\nHe will tell me over again all about it, how it feels, how it doesn't\nfeel, how he sometimes hopes it is passing off a little. And always\nsomewhere in that fat, abundant discourse he will say, \"The secret's\nkeeping, eh? If any one knew of it--I should be so ashamed.... Makes a\nfellow look such a fool, you know. Crawling about on a ceiling and all\nthat....\"\n\nAnd now to elude Pyecraft, occupying, as he does, an admirable strategic\nposition between me and the door.\n\n\n\n\n5. MR. SKELMERSDALE IN FAIRYLAND\n\n\"There's a man in that shop,\" said the Doctor, \"who has been in\nFairyland.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said, and stared back at the shop. It was the usual\nvillage shop, post-office, telegraph wire on its brow, zinc pans and\nbrushes outside, boots, shirtings, and potted meats in the window. \"Tell\nme about it,\" I said, after a pause.\n\n\"_I_ don't know,\" said the Doctor. \"He's an ordinary sort of\nlout--Skelmersdale is his name. But everybody about here believes it\nlike Bible truth.\"\n\nI reverted presently to the topic.\n\n\"I know nothing about it,\" said the Doctor, \"and I don't WANT to know. I\nattended him for a broken finger--Married and Single cricket match--and\nthat's when I struck the nonsense. That's all. But it shows you the sort\nof stuff I have to deal with, anyhow, eh? Nice to get modern sanitary\nideas into a people like this!\"\n\n\"Very,\" I said in a mildly sympathetic tone, and he went on to tell me\nabout that business of the Bonham drain. Things of that kind, I observe,\nare apt to weigh on the minds of Medical Officers of Health. I was as\nsympathetic as I knew how, and when he called the Bonham people \"asses,\"\nI said they were \"thundering asses,\" but even that did not allay him.\n\nAfterwards, later in the summer, an urgent desire to seclude myself,\nwhile finishing my chapter on Spiritual Pathology--it was really, I\nbelieve, stiffer to write than it is to read--took me to Bignor. I\nlodged at a farmhouse, and presently found myself outside that little\ngeneral shop again, in search of tobacco. \"Skelmersdale,\" said I to\nmyself at the sight of it, and went in.\n\nI was served by a short, but shapely, young man, with a fair downy\ncomplexion, good, small teeth, blue eyes, and a languid manner. I\nscrutinised him curiously. Except for a touch of melancholy in\nhis expression, he was nothing out of the common. He was in the\nshirt-sleeves and tucked-up apron of his trade, and a pencil was thrust\nbehind his inoffensive ear. Athwart his black waistcoat was a gold\nchain, from which dangled a bent guinea.\n\n\"Nothing more to-day, sir?\" he inquired. He leant forward over my bill\nas he spoke.\n\n\"Are you Mr. Skelmersdale?\" said I.\n\n\"I am, sir,\" he said, without looking up.\n\n\"Is it true that you have been in Fairyland?\"\n\nHe looked up at me for a moment with wrinkled brows, with an aggrieved,\nexasperated face. \"O SHUT it!\" he said, and, after a moment of\nhostility, eye to eye, he went on adding up my bill. \"Four, six and a\nhalf,\" he said, after a pause. \"Thank you, Sir.\"\n\nSo, unpropitiously, my acquaintance with Mr. Skelmersdale began.\n\nWell, I got from that to confidence--through a series of toilsome\nefforts. I picked him up again in the Village Room, where of a night\nI went to play billiards after my supper, and mitigate the extreme\nseclusion from my kind that was so helpful to work during the day. I\ncontrived to play with him and afterwards to talk with him. I found the\none subject to avoid was Fairyland. On everything else he was open\nand amiable in a commonplace sort of way, but on that he had been\nworried--it was a manifest taboo. Only once in the room did I hear the\nslightest allusion to his experience in his presence, and that was by\na cross-grained farm hand who was losing to him. Skelmersdale had run\na break into double figures, which, by the Bignor standards, was\nuncommonly good play. \"Steady on!\" said his adversary. \"None of your\nfairy flukes!\"\n\nSkelmersdale stared at him for a moment, cue in hand, then flung it down\nand walked out of the room.\n\n\"Why can't you leave 'im alone?\" said a respectable elder who had been\nenjoying the game, and in the general murmur of disapproval the grin of\nsatisfied wit faded from the ploughboy's face.\n\nI scented my opportunity. \"What's this joke,\" said I, \"about Fairyland?\"\n\n\"'Tain't no joke about Fairyland, not to young Skelmersdale,\" said the\nrespectable elder, drinking. A little man with rosy cheeks was more\ncommunicative. \"They DO say, sir,\" he said, \"that they took him into\nAldington Knoll an' kep' him there a matter of three weeks.\"\n\nAnd with that the gathering was well under weigh. Once one sheep had\nstarted, others were ready enough to follow, and in a little time I\nhad at least the exterior aspect of the Skelmersdale affair. Formerly,\nbefore he came to Bignor, he had been in that very similar little shop\nat Aldington Corner, and there whatever it was did happen had taken\nplace. The story was clear that he had stayed out late one night on\nthe Knoll and vanished for three weeks from the sight of men, and had\nreturned with \"his cuffs as clean as when he started,\" and his pockets\nfull of dust and ashes. He returned in a state of moody wretchedness\nthat only slowly passed away, and for many days he would give no account\nof where it was he had been. The girl he was engaged to at Clapton\nHill tried to get it out of him, and threw him over partly because he\nrefused, and partly because, as she said, he fairly gave her the \"'ump.\"\nAnd then when, some time after, he let out to some one carelessly that\nhe had been in Fairyland and wanted to go back, and when the thing\nspread and the simple badinage of the countryside came into play, he\nthrew up his situation abruptly, and came to Bignor to get out of the\nfuss. But as to what had happened in Fairyland none of these people\nknew. There the gathering in the Village Room went to pieces like a pack\nat fault. One said this, and another said that.\n\nTheir air in dealing with this marvel was ostensibly critical and\nsceptical, but I could see a considerable amount of belief showing\nthrough their guarded qualifications. I took a line of intelligent\ninterest, tinged with a reasonable doubt of the whole story.\n\n\"If Fairyland's inside Aldington Knoll,\" I said, \"why don't you dig it\nout?\"\n\n\"That's what I says,\" said the young ploughboy.\n\n\"There's a-many have tried to dig on Aldington Knoll,\" said the\nrespectable elder, solemnly, \"one time and another. But there's none as\ngoes about to-day to tell what they got by digging.\"\n\nThe unanimity of vague belief that surrounded me was rather impressive;\nI felt there must surely be SOMETHING at the root of so much conviction,\nand the already pretty keen curiosity I felt about the real facts of the\ncase was distinctly whetted. If these real facts were to be got from any\none, they were to be got from Skelmersdale himself; and I set myself,\ntherefore, still more assiduously to efface the first bad impression\nI had made and win his confidence to the pitch of voluntary speech. In\nthat endeavour I had a social advantage. Being a person of affability\nand no apparent employment, and wearing tweeds and knickerbockers, I was\nnaturally classed as an artist in Bignor, and in the remarkable code\nof social precedence prevalent in Bignor an artist ranks considerably\nhigher than a grocer's assistant. Skelmersdale, like too many of his\nclass, is something of a snob; he had told me to \"shut it,\" only under\nsudden, excessive provocation, and with, I am certain, a subsequent\nrepentance; he was, I knew, quite glad to be seen walking about the\nvillage with me. In due course, he accepted the proposal of a pipe and\nwhisky in my rooms readily enough, and there, scenting by some happy\ninstinct that there was trouble of the heart in this, and knowing that\nconfidences beget confidences, I plied him with much of interest and\nsuggestion from my real and fictitious past. And it was after the third\nwhisky of the third visit of that sort, if I remember rightly, that a\npropos of some artless expansion of a little affair that had touched\nand left me in my teens, that he did at last, of his own free will and\nmotion, break the ice. \"It was like that with me,\" he said, \"over there\nat Aldington. It's just that that's so rum. First I didn't care a bit\nand it was all her, and afterwards, when it was too late, it was, in a\nmanner of speaking, all me.\"\n\nI forbore to jump upon this allusion, and so he presently threw out\nanother, and in a little while he was making it as plain as daylight\nthat the one thing he wanted to talk about now was this Fairyland\nadventure he had sat tight upon for so long. You see, I'd done the\ntrick with him, and from being just another half-incredulous, would-be\nfacetious stranger, I had, by all my wealth of shameless self-exposure,\nbecome the possible confidant. He had been bitten by the desire to show\nthat he, too, had lived and felt many things, and the fever was upon\nhim.\n\nHe was certainly confoundedly allusive at first, and my eagerness\nto clear him up with a few precise questions was only equalled and\ncontrolled by my anxiety not to get to this sort of thing too soon. But\nin another meeting or so the basis of confidence was complete; and from\nfirst to last I think I got most of the items and aspects--indeed, I got\nquite a number of times over almost everything that Mr. Skelmersdale,\nwith his very limited powers of narration, will ever be able to tell.\nAnd so I come to the story of his adventure, and I piece it all together\nagain. Whether it really happened, whether he imagined it or dreamt it,\nor fell upon it in some strange hallucinatory trance, I do not profess\nto say. But that he invented it I will not for one moment entertain.\nThe man simply and honestly believes the thing happened as he says it\nhappened; he is transparently incapable of any lie so elaborate\nand sustained, and in the belief of the simple, yet often keenly\npenetrating, rustic minds about him I find a very strong confirmation of\nhis sincerity. He believes--and nobody can produce any positive fact to\nfalsify his belief. As for me, with this much of endorsement, I transmit\nhis story--I am a little old now to justify or explain.\n\nHe says he went to sleep on Aldington Knoll about ten o'clock one\nnight--it was quite possibly Midsummer night, though he has never\nthought of the date, and he cannot be sure within a week or so--and it\nwas a fine night and windless, with a rising moon. I have been at\nthe pains to visit this Knoll thrice since his story grew up under my\npersuasions, and once I went there in the twilight summer moonrise on\nwhat was, perhaps, a similar night to that of his adventure. Jupiter was\ngreat and splendid above the moon, and in the north and northwest the\nsky was green and vividly bright over the sunken sun. The Knoll stands\nout bare and bleak under the sky, but surrounded at a little distance by\ndark thickets, and as I went up towards it there was a mighty starting\nand scampering of ghostly or quite invisible rabbits. Just over\nthe crown of the Knoll, but nowhere else, was a multitudinous thin\ntrumpeting of midges. The Knoll is, I believe, an artificial mound,\nthe tumulus of some great prehistoric chieftain, and surely no man ever\nchose a more spacious prospect for a sepulchre. Eastward one sees along\nthe hills to Hythe, and thence across the Channel to where, thirty miles\nand more perhaps, away, the great white lights by Gris Nez and Boulogne\nwink and pass and shine. Westward lies the whole tumbled valley of the\nWeald, visible as far as Hindhead and Leith Hill, and the valley of the\nStour opens the Downs in the north to interminable hills beyond Wye.\nAll Romney Marsh lies southward at one's feet, Dymchurch and Romney and\nLydd, Hastings and its hill are in the middle distance, and the hills\nmultiply vaguely far beyond where Eastbourne rolls up to Beachy Head.\n\nAnd out upon all this it was that Skelmersdale wandered, being troubled\nin his earlier love affair, and as he says, \"not caring WHERE he went.\"\nAnd there he sat down to think it over, and so, sulking and grieving,\nwas overtaken by sleep. And so he fell into the fairies' power.\n\nThe quarrel that had upset him was some trivial matter enough between\nhimself and the girl at Clapton Hill to whom he was engaged. She was\na farmer's daughter, said Skelmersdale, and \"very respectable,\" and\nno doubt an excellent match for him; but both girl and lover were very\nyoung and with just that mutual jealousy, that intolerantly keen edge of\ncriticism, that irrational hunger for a beautiful perfection, that\nlife and wisdom do presently and most mercifully dull. What the precise\nmatter of quarrel was I have no idea. She may have said she liked men in\ngaiters when he hadn't any gaiters on, or he may have said he liked her\nbetter in a different sort of hat, but however it began, it got by\na series of clumsy stages to bitterness and tears. She no doubt got\ntearful and smeary, and he grew dusty and drooping, and she parted with\ninvidious comparisons, grave doubts whether she ever had REALLY cared\nfor him, and a clear certainty she would never care again. And with this\nsort of thing upon his mind he came out upon Aldington Knoll grieving,\nand presently, after a long interval, perhaps, quite inexplicably, fell\nasleep.\n\nHe woke to find himself on a softer turf than ever he had slept on\nbefore, and under the shade of very dark trees that completely hid the\nsky. Always, indeed, in Fairyland the sky is hidden, it seems. Except\nfor one night when the fairies were dancing, Mr. Skelmersdale, during\nall his time with them, never saw a star. And of that night I am in\ndoubt whether he was in Fairyland proper or out where the rings and\nrushes are, in those low meadows near the railway line at Smeeth.\n\nBut it was light under these trees for all that, and on the leaves and\namidst the turf shone a multitude of glow-worms, very bright and fine.\nMr. Skelmersdale's first impression was that he was SMALL, and the next\nthat quite a number of people still smaller were standing all about him.\nFor some reason, he says, he was neither surprised nor frightened, but\nsat up quite deliberately and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. And\nthere all about him stood the smiling elves who had caught him sleeping\nunder their privileges and had brought him into Fairyland.\n\nWhat these elves were like I have failed to gather, so vague and\nimperfect is his vocabulary, and so unobservant of all minor detail\ndoes he seem to have been. They were clothed in something very light and\nbeautiful, that was neither wool, nor silk, nor leaves, nor the petals\nof flowers. They stood all about him as he sat and waked, and down the\nglade towards him, down a glow-worm avenue and fronted by a star, came\nat once that Fairy Lady who is the chief personage of his memory and\ntale. Of her I gathered more. She was clothed in filmy green, and about\nher little waist was a broad silver girdle. Her hair waved back from\nher forehead on either side; there were curls not too wayward and yet\nastray, and on her brow was a little tiara, set with a single star. Her\nsleeves were some sort of open sleeves that gave little glimpses of her\narms; her throat, I think, was a little displayed, because he speaks of\nthe beauty of her neck and chin. There was a necklace of coral about\nher white throat, and in her breast a coral-coloured flower. She had the\nsoft lines of a little child in her chin and cheeks and throat. And\nher eyes, I gather, were of a kindled brown, very soft and straight and\nsweet under her level brows. You see by these particulars how greatly\nthis lady must have loomed in Mr. Skelmersdale's picture. Certain things\nhe tried to express and could not express; \"the way she moved,\" he said\nseveral times; and I fancy a sort of demure joyousness radiated from\nthis Lady.\n\nAnd it was in the company of this delightful person, as the guest and\nchosen companion of this delightful person, that Mr. Skelmersdale set\nout to be taken into the intimacies of Fairyland. She welcomed him\ngladly and a little warmly--I suspect a pressure of his hand in both of\nhers and a lit face to his. After all, ten years ago young Skelmersdale\nmay have been a very comely youth. And once she took his arm, and once,\nI think, she led him by the hand adown the glade that the glow-worms\nlit.\n\nJust how things chanced and happened there is no telling from Mr.\nSkelmersdale's disarticulated skeleton of description. He gives little\nunsatisfactory glimpses of strange corners and doings, of places where\nthere were many fairies together, of \"toadstool things that shone pink,\"\nof fairy food, of which he could only say \"you should have tasted\nit!\" and of fairy music, \"like a little musical box,\" that came out of\nnodding flowers. There was a great open place where fairies rode and\nraced on \"things,\" but what Mr. Skelmersdale meant by \"these here things\nthey rode,\" there is no telling. Larvae, perhaps, or crickets, or the\nlittle beetles that elude us so abundantly. There was a place where\nwater splashed and gigantic king-cups grew, and there in the hotter\ntimes the fairies bathed together. There were games being played and\ndancing and much elvish love-making, too, I think, among the moss-branch\nthickets. There can be no doubt that the Fairy Lady made love to Mr.\nSkelmersdale, and no doubt either that this young man set himself to\nresist her. A time came, indeed, when she sat on a bank beside him, in\na quiet, secluded place \"all smelling of vi'lets,\" and talked to him of\nlove.\n\n\"When her voice went low and she whispered,\" said Mr. Skelmersdale, \"and\nlaid 'er 'and on my 'and, you know, and came close with a soft, warm\nfriendly way she 'ad, it was as much as I could do to keep my 'ead.\"\n\nIt seems he kept his head to a certain limited unfortunate extent. He\nsaw \"'ow the wind was blowing,\" he says, and so, sitting there in a\nplace all smelling of violets, with the touch of this lovely Fairy Lady\nabout him, Mr. Skelmersdale broke it to her gently--that he was engaged!\n\nShe had told him she loved him dearly, that he was a sweet human lad for\nher, and whatever he would ask of her he should have--even his heart's\ndesire.\n\nAnd Mr. Skelmersdale, who, I fancy, tried hard to avoid looking at her\nlittle lips as they just dropped apart and came together, led up to the\nmore intimate question by saying he would like enough capital to start a\nlittle shop. He'd just like to feel, he said, he had money enough to do\nthat. I imagine a little surprise in those brown eyes he talked\nabout, but she seemed sympathetic for all that, and she asked him many\nquestions about the little shop, \"laughing like\" all the time. So he got\nto the complete statement of his affianced position, and told her all\nabout Millie.\n\n\"All?\" said I.\n\n\"Everything,\" said Mr. Skelmersdale, \"just who she was, and where she\nlived, and everything about her. I sort of felt I 'ad to all the time, I\ndid.\"\n\n\"'Whatever you want you shall have,' said the Fairy Lady. 'That's as\ngood as done. You SHALL feel you have the money just as you wish. And\nnow, you know--YOU MUST KISS ME.'\"\n\nAnd Mr. Skelmersdale pretended not to hear the latter part of her\nremark, and said she was very kind. That he really didn't deserve she\nshould be so kind. And--\n\nThe Fairy Lady suddenly came quite close to him and whispered, \"Kiss\nme!\"\n\n\"And,\" said Mr. Skelmersdale, \"like a fool, I did.\"\n\nThere are kisses and kisses, I am told, and this must have been quite\nthe other sort from Millie's resonant signals of regard. There was\nsomething magic in that kiss; assuredly it marked a turning point.\nAt any rate, this is one of the passages that he thought sufficiently\nimportant to describe most at length. I have tried to get it right, I\nhave tried to disentangle it from the hints and gestures through which\nit came to me, but I have no doubt that it was all different from my\ntelling and far finer and sweeter, in the soft filtered light and the\nsubtly stirring silences of the fairy glades. The Fairy Lady asked him\nmore about Millie, and was she very lovely, and so on--a great many\ntimes. As to Millie's loveliness, I conceive him answering that she was\n\"all right.\" And then, or on some such occasion, the Fairy Lady told him\nshe had fallen in love with him as he slept in the moonlight, and so\nhe had been brought into Fairyland, and she had thought, not knowing of\nMillie, that perhaps he might chance to love her. \"But now you know you\ncan't,\" she said, \"so you must stop with me just a little while, and\nthen you must go back to Millie.\" She told him that, and you know\nSkelmersdale was already in love with her, but the pure inertia of his\nmind kept him in the way he was going. I imagine him sitting in a sort\nof stupefaction amidst all these glowing beautiful things, answering\nabout his Millie and the little shop he projected and the need of a\nhorse and cart.... And that absurd state of affairs must have gone on\nfor days and days. I see this little lady, hovering about him and trying\nto amuse him, too dainty to understand his complexity and too tender\nto let him go. And he, you know, hypnotised as it were by his earthly\nposition, went his way with her hither and thither, blind to everything\nin Fairyland but this wonderful intimacy that had come to him. It is\nhard, it is impossible, to give in print the effect of her radiant\nsweetness shining through the jungle of poor Skelmersdale's rough and\nbroken sentences. To me, at least, she shone clear amidst the muddle of\nhis story like a glow-worm in a tangle of weeds.\n\nThere must have been many days of things while all this was\nhappening--and once, I say, they danced under the moonlight in the fairy\nrings that stud the meadows near Smeeth--but at last it all came to an\nend. She led him into a great cavernous place, lit by a red nightlight\nsort of thing, where there were coffers piled on coffers, and cups\nand golden boxes, and a great heap of what certainly seemed to all Mr.\nSkelmersdale's senses--coined gold. There were little gnomes amidst this\nwealth, who saluted her at her coming, and stood aside. And suddenly she\nturned on him there with brightly shining eyes.\n\n\"And now,\" she said, \"you have been kind to stay with me so long, and it\nis time I let you go. You must go back to your Millie. You must go back\nto your Millie, and here--just as I promised you--they will give you\ngold.\"\n\n\"She choked like,\" said Mr. Skelmersdale. \"At that, I had a sort of\nfeeling--\" (he touched his breastbone) \"as though I was fainting here.\nI felt pale, you know, and shivering, and even then--I 'adn't a thing to\nsay.\"\n\nHe paused. \"Yes,\" I said.\n\nThe scene was beyond his describing. But I know that she kissed him\ngood-bye.\n\n\"And you said nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said. \"I stood like a stuffed calf. She just looked back\nonce, you know, and stood smiling like and crying--I could see the\nshine of her eyes--and then she was gone, and there was all these little\nfellows bustling about me, stuffing my 'ands and my pockets and the back\nof my collar and everywhere with gold.\"\n\nAnd then it was, when the Fairy Lady had vanished, that Mr. Skelmersdale\nreally understood and knew. He suddenly began plucking out the gold\nthey were thrusting upon him, and shouting out at them to prevent their\ngiving him more. \"'I don't WANT yer gold,' I said. 'I 'aven't done yet.\nI'm not going. I want to speak to that Fairy Lady again.' I started off\nto go after her and they held me back. Yes, stuck their little 'ands\nagainst my middle and shoved me back. They kept giving me more and more\ngold until it was running all down my trouser legs and dropping out of\nmy 'ands. 'I don't WANT yer gold,' I says to them, 'I want just to speak\nto the Fairy Lady again.'\"\n\n\"And did you?\"\n\n\"It came to a tussle.\"\n\n\"Before you saw her?\"\n\n\"I didn't see her. When I got out from them she wasn't anywhere to be\nseen.\"\n\nSo he ran in search of her out of this red-lit cave, down a long grotto,\nseeking her, and thence he came out in a great and desolate place\nathwart which a swarm of will-o'-the-wisps were flying to and fro. And\nabout him elves were dancing in derision, and the little gnomes came out\nof the cave after him, carrying gold in handfuls and casting it after\nhim, shouting, \"Fairy love and fairy gold! Fairy love and fairy gold!\"\n\nAnd when he heard these words, came a great fear that it was all over,\nand he lifted up his voice and called to her by her name, and suddenly\nset himself to run down the slope from the mouth of the cavern, through\na place of thorns and briers, calling after her very loudly and often.\nThe elves danced about him unheeded, pinching him and pricking him, and\nthe will-o'-the-wisps circled round him and dashed into his face, and\nthe gnomes pursued him shouting and pelting him with fairy gold. As he\nran with all this strange rout about him and distracting him, suddenly\nhe was knee-deep in a swamp, and suddenly he was amidst thick twisted\nroots, and he caught his foot in one and stumbled and fell....\n\nHe fell and he rolled over, and in that instant he found himself\nsprawling upon Aldington Knoll, all lonely under the stars.\n\nHe sat up sharply at once, he says, and found he was very stiff and\ncold, and his clothes were damp with dew. The first pallor of dawn and\na chilly wind were coming up together. He could have believed the whole\nthing a strangely vivid dream until he thrust his hand into his side\npocket and found it stuffed with ashes. Then he knew for certain it\nwas fairy gold they had given him. He could feel all their pinches and\npricks still, though there was never a bruise upon him. And in that\nmanner, and so suddenly, Mr. Skelmersdale came out of Fairyland back\ninto this world of men. Even then he fancied the thing was but the\nmatter of a night until he returned to the shop at Aldington Corner and\ndiscovered amidst their astonishment that he had been away three weeks.\n\n\"Lor'! the trouble I 'ad!\" said Mr. Skelmersdale.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Explaining. I suppose you've never had anything like that to explain.\"\n\n\"Never,\" I said, and he expatiated for a time on the behaviour of this\nperson and that. One name he avoided for a space.\n\n\"And Millie?\" said I at last.\n\n\"I didn't seem to care a bit for seeing Millie,\" he said.\n\n\"I expect she seemed changed?\"\n\n\"Every one was changed. Changed for good. Every one seemed big, you\nknow, and coarse. And their voices seemed loud. Why, the sun, when it\nrose in the morning, fair hit me in the eye!\"\n\n\"And Millie?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to see Millie.\"\n\n\"And when you did?\"\n\n\"I came up against her Sunday, coming out of church. 'Where you been?'\nshe said, and I saw there was a row. _I_ didn't care if there was. I\nseemed to forget about her even while she was there a-talking to me. She\nwas just nothing. I couldn't make out whatever I 'ad seen in 'er ever,\nor what there could 'ave been. Sometimes when she wasn't about, I did\nget back a little, but never when she was there. Then it was always the\nother came up and blotted her out.... Anyow, it didn't break her heart.\"\n\n\"Married?\" I asked.\n\n\"Married 'er cousin,\" said Mr. Skelmersdale, and reflected on the\npattern of the tablecloth for a space.\n\nWhen he spoke again it was clear that his former sweetheart had clean\nvanished from his mind, and that the talk had brought back the Fairy\nLady triumphant in his heart. He talked of her--soon he was letting out\nthe oddest things, queer love secrets it would be treachery to repeat. I\nthink, indeed, that was the queerest thing in the whole affair, to hear\nthat neat little grocer man after his story was done, with a glass of\nwhisky beside him and a cigar between his fingers, witnessing, with\nsorrow still, though now, indeed, with a time-blunted anguish, of\nthe inappeasable hunger of the heart that presently came upon him. \"I\ncouldn't eat,\" he said, \"I couldn't sleep. I made mistakes in orders\nand got mixed with change. There she was day and night, drawing me and\ndrawing me. Oh, I wanted her. Lord! how I wanted her! I was up there,\nmost evenings I was up there on the Knoll, often even when it rained. I\nused to walk over the Knoll and round it and round it, calling for them\nto let me in. Shouting. Near blubbering I was at times. Daft I was\nand miserable. I kept on saying it was all a mistake. And every Sunday\nafternoon I went up there, wet and fine, though I knew as well as you do\nit wasn't no good by day. And I've tried to go to sleep there.\"\n\nHe stopped sharply and decided to drink some whisky.\n\n\"I've tried to go to sleep there,\" he said, and I could swear his lips\ntrembled. \"I've tried to go to sleep there, often and often. And, you\nknow, I couldn't, sir--never. I've thought if I could go to sleep there,\nthere might be something. But I've sat up there and laid up there, and\nI couldn't--not for thinking and longing. It's the longing.... I've\ntried--\"\n\nHe blew, drank up the rest of his whisky spasmodically, stood up\nsuddenly and buttoned his jacket, staring closely and critically at the\ncheap oleographs beside the mantel meanwhile. The little black notebook\nin which he recorded the orders of his daily round projected stiffly\nfrom his breast pocket. When all the buttons were quite done, he patted\nhis chest and turned on me suddenly. \"Well,\" he said, \"I must be going.\"\n\nThere was something in his eyes and manner that was too difficult for\nhim to express in words. \"One gets talking,\" he said at last at the\ndoor, and smiled wanly, and so vanished from my eyes. And that is the\ntale of Mr. Skelmersdale in Fairyland just as he told it to me.\n\n\n\n\n6. THE STORY OF THE INEXPERIENCED GHOST\n\nThe scene amidst which Clayton told his last story comes back very\nvividly to my mind. There he sat, for the greater part of the time,\nin the corner of the authentic settle by the spacious open fire, and\nSanderson sat beside him smoking the Broseley clay that bore his name.\nThere was Evans, and that marvel among actors, Wish, who is also a\nmodest man. We had all come down to the Mermaid Club that Saturday\nmorning, except Clayton, who had slept there overnight--which indeed\ngave him the opening of his story. We had golfed until golfing was\ninvisible; we had dined, and we were in that mood of tranquil kindliness\nwhen men will suffer a story. When Clayton began to tell one, we\nnaturally supposed he was lying. It may be that indeed he was lying--of\nthat the reader will speedily be able to judge as well as I. He began,\nit is true, with an air of matter-of-fact anecdote, but that we thought\nwas only the incurable artifice of the man.\n\n\"I say!\" he remarked, after a long consideration of the upward rain of\nsparks from the log that Sanderson had thumped, \"you know I was alone\nhere last night?\"\n\n\"Except for the domestics,\" said Wish.\n\n\"Who sleep in the other wing,\" said Clayton. \"Yes. Well--\" He pulled at\nhis cigar for some little time as though he still hesitated about his\nconfidence. Then he said, quite quietly, \"I caught a ghost!\"\n\n\"Caught a ghost, did you?\" said Sanderson. \"Where is it?\"\n\nAnd Evans, who admires Clayton immensely and has been four weeks in\nAmerica, shouted, \"CAUGHT a ghost, did you, Clayton? I'm glad of it!\nTell us all about it right now.\"\n\nClayton said he would in a minute, and asked him to shut the door.\n\nHe looked apologetically at me. \"There's no eavesdropping of course, but\nwe don't want to upset our very excellent service with any rumours of\nghosts in the place. There's too much shadow and oak panelling to trifle\nwith that. And this, you know, wasn't a regular ghost. I don't think it\nwill come again--ever.\"\n\n\"You mean to say you didn't keep it?\" said Sanderson.\n\n\"I hadn't the heart to,\" said Clayton.\n\nAnd Sanderson said he was surprised.\n\nWe laughed, and Clayton looked aggrieved. \"I know,\" he said, with the\nflicker of a smile, \"but the fact is it really WAS a ghost, and I'm as\nsure of it as I am that I am talking to you now. I'm not joking. I mean\nwhat I say.\"\n\nSanderson drew deeply at his pipe, with one reddish eye on Clayton, and\nthen emitted a thin jet of smoke more eloquent than many words.\n\nClayton ignored the comment. \"It is the strangest thing that has ever\nhappened in my life. You know, I never believed in ghosts or anything of\nthe sort, before, ever; and then, you know, I bag one in a corner; and\nthe whole business is in my hands.\"\n\nHe meditated still more profoundly, and produced and began to pierce a\nsecond cigar with a curious little stabber he affected.\n\n\"You talked to it?\" asked Wish.\n\n\"For the space, probably, of an hour.\"\n\n\"Chatty?\" I said, joining the party of the sceptics.\n\n\"The poor devil was in trouble,\" said Clayton, bowed over his cigar-end\nand with the very faintest note of reproof.\n\n\"Sobbing?\" some one asked.\n\nClayton heaved a realistic sigh at the memory. \"Good Lord!\" he said;\n\"yes.\" And then, \"Poor fellow! yes.\"\n\n\"Where did you strike it?\" asked Evans, in his best American accent.\n\n\"I never realised,\" said Clayton, ignoring him, \"the poor sort of thing\na ghost might be,\" and he hung us up again for a time, while he sought\nfor matches in his pocket and lit and warmed to his cigar.\n\n\"I took an advantage,\" he reflected at last.\n\nWe were none of us in a hurry. \"A character,\" he said, \"remains just the\nsame character for all that it's been disembodied. That's a thing we too\noften forget. People with a certain strength or fixity of purpose may\nhave ghosts of a certain strength and fixity of purpose--most haunting\nghosts, you know, must be as one-idea'd as monomaniacs and as obstinate\nas mules to come back again and again. This poor creature wasn't.\" He\nsuddenly looked up rather queerly, and his eye went round the room. \"I\nsay it,\" he said, \"in all kindliness, but that is the plain truth of the\ncase. Even at the first glance he struck me as weak.\"\n\nHe punctuated with the help of his cigar.\n\n\"I came upon him, you know, in the long passage. His back was towards\nme and I saw him first. Right off I knew him for a ghost. He was\ntransparent and whitish; clean through his chest I could see the glimmer\nof the little window at the end. And not only his physique but his\nattitude struck me as being weak. He looked, you know, as though he\ndidn't know in the slightest whatever he meant to do. One hand was on\nthe panelling and the other fluttered to his mouth. Like--SO!\"\n\n\"What sort of physique?\" said Sanderson.\n\n\"Lean. You know that sort of young man's neck that has two great\nflutings down the back, here and here--so! And a little, meanish head\nwith scrubby hair--And rather bad ears. Shoulders bad, narrower than the\nhips; turn-down collar, ready-made short jacket, trousers baggy and a\nlittle frayed at the heels. That's how he took me. I came very quietly\nup the staircase. I did not carry a light, you know--the candles are on\nthe landing table and there is that lamp--and I was in my list slippers,\nand I saw him as I came up. I stopped dead at that--taking him in. I\nwasn't a bit afraid. I think that in most of these affairs one is\nnever nearly so afraid or excited as one imagines one would be. I was\nsurprised and interested. I thought, 'Good Lord! Here's a ghost at\nlast! And I haven't believed for a moment in ghosts during the last\nfive-and-twenty years.'\"\n\n\"Um,\" said Wish.\n\n\"I suppose I wasn't on the landing a moment before he found out I was\nthere. He turned on me sharply, and I saw the face of an immature young\nman, a weak nose, a scrubby little moustache, a feeble chin. So for an\ninstant we stood--he looking over his shoulder at me and regarded one\nanother. Then he seemed to remember his high calling. He turned round,\ndrew himself up, projected his face, raised his arms, spread his hands\nin approved ghost fashion--came towards me. As he did so his little jaw\ndropped, and he emitted a faint, drawn-out 'Boo.' No, it wasn't--not a\nbit dreadful. I'd dined. I'd had a bottle of champagne, and being all\nalone, perhaps two or three--perhaps even four or five--whiskies, so I\nwas as solid as rocks and no more frightened than if I'd been assailed\nby a frog. 'Boo!' I said. 'Nonsense. You don't belong to THIS place.\nWhat are you doing here?'\n\n\"I could see him wince. 'Boo-oo,' he said.\n\n\"'Boo--be hanged! Are you a member?' I said; and just to show I didn't\ncare a pin for him I stepped through a corner of him and made to light\nmy candle. 'Are you a member?' I repeated, looking at him sideways.\n\n\"He moved a little so as to stand clear of me, and his bearing became\ncrestfallen. 'No,' he said, in answer to the persistent interrogation of\nmy eye; 'I'm not a member--I'm a ghost.'\n\n\"'Well, that doesn't give you the run of the Mermaid Club. Is there any\none you want to see, or anything of that sort?' and doing it as steadily\nas possible for fear that he should mistake the carelessness of whisky\nfor the distraction of fear, I got my candle alight. I turned on him,\nholding it. 'What are you doing here?' I said.\n\n\"He had dropped his hands and stopped his booing, and there he stood,\nabashed and awkward, the ghost of a weak, silly, aimless young man. 'I'm\nhaunting,' he said.\n\n\"'You haven't any business to,' I said in a quiet voice.\n\n\"'I'm a ghost,' he said, as if in defence.\n\n\"'That may be, but you haven't any business to haunt here. This is a\nrespectable private club; people often stop here with nursemaids and\nchildren, and, going about in the careless way you do, some poor little\nmite could easily come upon you and be scared out of her wits. I suppose\nyou didn't think of that?'\n\n\"'No, sir,' he said, 'I didn't.'\n\n\"'You should have done. You haven't any claim on the place, have you?\nWeren't murdered here, or anything of that sort?'\n\n\"'None, sir; but I thought as it was old and oak-panelled--'\n\n\"'That's NO excuse.' I regarded him firmly. 'Your coming here is a\nmistake,' I said, in a tone of friendly superiority. I feigned to see\nif I had my matches, and then looked up at him frankly. 'If I were you I\nwouldn't wait for cock-crow--I'd vanish right away.'\n\n\"He looked embarrassed. 'The fact IS, sir--' he began.\n\n\"'I'd vanish,' I said, driving it home.\n\n\"'The fact is, sir, that--somehow--I can't.'\n\n\"'You CAN'T?'\n\n\"'No, sir. There's something I've forgotten. I've been hanging about\nhere since midnight last night, hiding in the cupboards of the empty\nbedrooms and things like that. I'm flurried. I've never come haunting\nbefore, and it seems to put me out.'\n\n\"'Put you out?'\n\n\"'Yes, sir. I've tried to do it several times, and it doesn't come off.\nThere's some little thing has slipped me, and I can't get back.'\n\n\"That, you know, rather bowled me over. He looked at me in such an\nabject way that for the life of me I couldn't keep up quite the high,\nhectoring vein I had adopted. 'That's queer,' I said, and as I spoke I\nfancied I heard some one moving about down below. 'Come into my room and\ntell me more about it,' I said. 'I didn't, of course, understand this,'\nand I tried to take him by the arm. But, of course, you might as well\nhave tried to take hold of a puff of smoke! I had forgotten my number,\nI think; anyhow, I remember going into several bedrooms--it was lucky I\nwas the only soul in that wing--until I saw my traps. 'Here we are,' I\nsaid, and sat down in the arm-chair; 'sit down and tell me all about it.\nIt seems to me you have got yourself into a jolly awkward position, old\nchap.'\n\n\"Well, he said he wouldn't sit down! he'd prefer to flit up and down the\nroom if it was all the same to me. And so he did, and in a little\nwhile we were deep in a long and serious talk. And presently, you know,\nsomething of those whiskies and sodas evaporated out of me, and I began\nto realise just a little what a thundering rum and weird business it was\nthat I was in. There he was, semi-transparent--the proper conventional\nphantom, and noiseless except for his ghost of a voice--flitting to\nand fro in that nice, clean, chintz-hung old bedroom. You could see\nthe gleam of the copper candlesticks through him, and the lights on the\nbrass fender, and the corners of the framed engravings on the wall,--and\nthere he was telling me all about this wretched little life of his that\nhad recently ended on earth. He hadn't a particularly honest face, you\nknow, but being transparent, of course, he couldn't avoid telling the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Wish, suddenly sitting up in his chair.\n\n\"What?\" said Clayton.\n\n\"Being transparent--couldn't avoid telling the truth--I don't see it,\"\nsaid Wish.\n\n\"_I_ don't see it,\" said Clayton, with inimitable assurance. \"But it IS\nso, I can assure you nevertheless. I don't believe he got once a nail's\nbreadth off the Bible truth. He told me how he had been killed--he\nwent down into a London basement with a candle to look for a leakage\nof gas--and described himself as a senior English master in a London\nprivate school when that release occurred.\"\n\n\"Poor wretch!\" said I.\n\n\"That's what I thought, and the more he talked the more I thought it.\nThere he was, purposeless in life and purposeless out of it. He talked\nof his father and mother and his schoolmaster, and all who had ever been\nanything to him in the world, meanly. He had been too sensitive, too\nnervous; none of them had ever valued him properly or understood him, he\nsaid. He had never had a real friend in the world, I think; he had never\nhad a success. He had shirked games and failed examinations. 'It's\nlike that with some people,' he said; 'whenever I got into the\nexamination-room or anywhere everything seemed to go.' Engaged to be\nmarried of course--to another over-sensitive person, I suppose--when the\nindiscretion with the gas escape ended his affairs. 'And where are you\nnow?' I asked. 'Not in--?'\n\n\"He wasn't clear on that point at all. The impression he gave me was\nof a sort of vague, intermediate state, a special reserve for souls too\nnon-existent for anything so positive as either sin or virtue. _I_ don't\nknow. He was much too egotistical and unobservant to give me any clear\nidea of the kind of place, kind of country, there is on the Other Side\nof Things. Wherever he was, he seems to have fallen in with a set of\nkindred spirits: ghosts of weak Cockney young men, who were on a footing\nof Christian names, and among these there was certainly a lot of talk\nabout 'going haunting' and things like that. Yes--going haunting! They\nseemed to think 'haunting' a tremendous adventure, and most of them\nfunked it all the time. And so primed, you know, he had come.\"\n\n\"But really!\" said Wish to the fire.\n\n\"These are the impressions he gave me, anyhow,\" said Clayton, modestly.\n\"I may, of course, have been in a rather uncritical state, but that was\nthe sort of background he gave to himself. He kept flitting up and down,\nwith his thin voice going talking, talking about his wretched self, and\nnever a word of clear, firm statement from first to last. He was thinner\nand sillier and more pointless than if he had been real and alive. Only\nthen, you know, he would not have been in my bedroom here--if he HAD\nbeen alive. I should have kicked him out.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Evans, \"there ARE poor mortals like that.\"\n\n\"And there's just as much chance of their having ghosts as the rest of\nus,\" I admitted.\n\n\"What gave a sort of point to him, you know, was the fact that he did\nseem within limits to have found himself out. The mess he had made of\nhaunting had depressed him terribly. He had been told it would be\na 'lark'; he had come expecting it to be a 'lark,' and here it was,\nnothing but another failure added to his record! He proclaimed himself\nan utter out-and-out failure. He said, and I can quite believe it, that\nhe had never tried to do anything all his life that he hadn't made a\nperfect mess of--and through all the wastes of eternity he never\nwould. If he had had sympathy, perhaps--. He paused at that, and stood\nregarding me. He remarked that, strange as it might seem to me, nobody,\nnot any one, ever, had given him the amount of sympathy I was doing now.\nI could see what he wanted straight away, and I determined to head him\noff at once. I may be a brute, you know, but being the Only Real Friend,\nthe recipient of the confidences of one of these egotistical weaklings,\nghost or body, is beyond my physical endurance. I got up briskly. 'Don't\nyou brood on these things too much,' I said. 'The thing you've got to do\nis to get out of this get out of this--sharp. You pull yourself together\nand TRY.' 'I can't,' he said. 'You try,' I said, and try he did.\"\n\n\"Try!\" said Sanderson. \"HOW?\"\n\n\"Passes,\" said Clayton.\n\n\"Passes?\"\n\n\"Complicated series of gestures and passes with the hands. That's how\nhe had come in and that's how he had to get out again. Lord! what a\nbusiness I had!\"\n\n\"But how could ANY series of passes--?\" I began.\n\n\"My dear man,\" said Clayton, turning on me and putting a great emphasis\non certain words, \"you want EVERYTHING clear. _I_ don't know HOW. All\nI know is that you DO--that HE did, anyhow, at least. After a fearful\ntime, you know, he got his passes right and suddenly disappeared.\"\n\n\"Did you,\" said Sanderson, slowly, \"observe the passes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clayton, and seemed to think. \"It was tremendously queer,\"\nhe said. \"There we were, I and this thin vague ghost, in that silent\nroom, in this silent, empty inn, in this silent little Friday-night\ntown. Not a sound except our voices and a faint panting he made when\nhe swung. There was the bedroom candle, and one candle on the\ndressing-table alight, that was all--sometimes one or other would flare\nup into a tall, lean, astonished flame for a space. And queer things\nhappened. 'I can't,' he said; 'I shall never--!' And suddenly he sat\ndown on a little chair at the foot of the bed and began to sob and sob.\nLord! what a harrowing, whimpering thing he seemed!\n\n\"'You pull yourself together,' I said, and tried to pat him on the back,\nand... my confounded hand went through him! By that time, you know,\nI wasn't nearly so--massive as I had been on the landing. I got the\nqueerness of it full. I remember snatching back my hand out of him, as\nit were, with a little thrill, and walking over to the dressing-table.\n'You pull yourself together,' I said to him, 'and try.' And in order to\nencourage and help him I began to try as well.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Sanderson, \"the passes?\"\n\n\"Yes, the passes.\"\n\n\"But--\" I said, moved by an idea that eluded me for a space.\n\n\"This is interesting,\" said Sanderson, with his finger in his pipe-bowl.\n\"You mean to say this ghost of yours gave away--\"\n\n\"Did his level best to give away the whole confounded barrier? YES.\"\n\n\"He didn't,\" said Wish; \"he couldn't. Or you'd have gone there too.\"\n\n\"That's precisely it,\" I said, finding my elusive idea put into words\nfor me.\n\n\"That IS precisely it,\" said Clayton, with thoughtful eyes upon the\nfire.\n\nFor just a little while there was silence.\n\n\"And at last he did it?\" said Sanderson.\n\n\"At last he did it. I had to keep him up to it hard, but he did it at\nlast--rather suddenly. He despaired, we had a scene, and then he got up\nabruptly and asked me to go through the whole performance, slowly, so\nthat he might see. 'I believe,' he said, 'if I could SEE I should spot\nwhat was wrong at once.' And he did. '_I_ know,' he said. 'What do you\nknow?' said I. '_I_ know,' he repeated. Then he said, peevishly, 'I\nCAN'T do it if you look at me--I really CAN'T; it's been that, partly,\nall along. I'm such a nervous fellow that you put me out.' Well, we had\na bit of an argument. Naturally I wanted to see; but he was as obstinate\nas a mule, and suddenly I had come over as tired as a dog--he tired me\nout. 'All right,' I said, '_I_ won't look at you,' and turned towards\nthe mirror, on the wardrobe, by the bed.\n\n\"He started off very fast. I tried to follow him by looking in the\nlooking-glass, to see just what it was had hung. Round went his arms\nand his hands, so, and so, and so, and then with a rush came to the last\ngesture of all--you stand erect and open out your arms--and so, don't\nyou know, he stood. And then he didn't! He didn't! He wasn't! I wheeled\nround from the looking-glass to him. There was nothing, I was alone,\nwith the flaring candles and a staggering mind. What had happened? Had\nanything happened? Had I been dreaming?... And then, with an absurd note\nof finality about it, the clock upon the landing discovered the moment\nwas ripe for striking ONE. So!--Ping! And I was as grave and sober as\na judge, with all my champagne and whisky gone into the vast serene.\nFeeling queer, you know--confoundedly QUEER! Queer! Good Lord!\"\n\nHe regarded his cigar-ash for a moment. \"That's all that happened,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"And then you went to bed?\" asked Evans.\n\n\"What else was there to do?\"\n\nI looked Wish in the eye. We wanted to scoff, and there was something,\nsomething perhaps in Clayton's voice and manner, that hampered our\ndesire.\n\n\"And about these passes?\" said Sanderson.\n\n\"I believe I could do them now.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Sanderson, and produced a penknife and set himself to grub\nthe dottel out of the bowl of his clay.\n\n\"Why don't you do them now?\" said Sanderson, shutting his pen-knife with\na click.\n\n\"That's what I'm going to do,\" said Clayton.\n\n\"They won't work,\" said Evans.\n\n\"If they do--\" I suggested.\n\n\"You know, I'd rather you didn't,\" said Wish, stretching out his legs.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Evans.\n\n\"I'd rather he didn't,\" said Wish.\n\n\"But he hasn't got 'em right,\" said Sanderson, plugging too much tobacco\nin his pipe.\n\n\"All the same, I'd rather he didn't,\" said Wish.\n\nWe argued with Wish. He said that for Clayton to go through those\ngestures was like mocking a serious matter. \"But you don't believe--?\"\nI said. Wish glanced at Clayton, who was staring into the fire, weighing\nsomething in his mind. \"I do--more than half, anyhow, I do,\" said Wish.\n\n\"Clayton,\" said I, \"you're too good a liar for us. Most of it was all\nright. But that disappearance... happened to be convincing. Tell us,\nit's a tale of cock and bull.\"\n\nHe stood up without heeding me, took the middle of the hearthrug, and\nfaced me. For a moment he regarded his feet thoughtfully, and then for\nall the rest of the time his eyes were on the opposite wall, with an\nintent expression. He raised his two hands slowly to the level of his\neyes and so began....\n\nNow, Sanderson is a Freemason, a member of the lodge of the Four Kings,\nwhich devotes itself so ably to the study and elucidation of all the\nmysteries of Masonry past and present, and among the students of this\nlodge Sanderson is by no means the least. He followed Clayton's motions\nwith a singular interest in his reddish eye. \"That's not bad,\" he\nsaid, when it was done. \"You really do, you know, put things together,\nClayton, in a most amazing fashion. But there's one little detail out.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Clayton. \"I believe I could tell you which.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"This,\" said Clayton, and did a queer little twist and writhing and\nthrust of the hands.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That, you know, was what HE couldn't get right,\" said Clayton. \"But how\ndo YOU--?\"\n\n\"Most of this business, and particularly how you invented it, I don't\nunderstand at all,\" said Sanderson, \"but just that phase--I do.\" He\nreflected. \"These happen to be a series of gestures--connected with a\ncertain branch of esoteric Masonry. Probably you know. Or else--HOW?\" He\nreflected still further. \"I do not see I can do any harm in telling you\njust the proper twist. After all, if you know, you know; if you don't,\nyou don't.\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" said Clayton, \"except what the poor devil let out last\nnight.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" said Sanderson, and placed his churchwarden very\ncarefully upon the shelf over the fireplace. Then very rapidly he\ngesticulated with his hands.\n\n\"So?\" said Clayton, repeating.\n\n\"So,\" said Sanderson, and took his pipe in hand again.\n\n\"Ah, NOW,\" said Clayton, \"I can do the whole thing--right.\"\n\nHe stood up before the waning fire and smiled at us all. But I think\nthere was just a little hesitation in his smile. \"If I begin--\" he said.\n\n\"I wouldn't begin,\" said Wish.\n\n\"It's all right!\" said Evans. \"Matter is indestructible. You don't think\nany jiggery-pokery of this sort is going to snatch Clayton into the\nworld of shades. Not it! You may try, Clayton, so far as I'm concerned,\nuntil your arms drop off at the wrists.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that,\" said Wish, and stood up and put his arm on\nClayton's shoulder. \"You've made me half believe in that story somehow,\nand I don't want to see the thing done!\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" said I, \"here's Wish frightened!\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Wish, with real or admirably feigned intensity. \"I believe\nthat if he goes through these motions right he'll GO.\"\n\n\"He'll not do anything of the sort,\" I cried. \"There's only one way out\nof this world for men, and Clayton is thirty years from that. Besides...\nAnd such a ghost! Do you think--?\"\n\nWish interrupted me by moving. He walked out from among our chairs and\nstopped beside the tole and stood there. \"Clayton,\" he said, \"you're a\nfool.\"\n\nClayton, with a humorous light in his eyes, smiled back at him. \"Wish,\"\nhe said, \"is right and all you others are wrong. I shall go. I shall get\nto the end of these passes, and as the last swish whistles through the\nair, Presto!--this hearthrug will be vacant, the room will be blank\namazement, and a respectably dressed gentleman of fifteen stone will\nplump into the world of shades. I'm certain. So will you be. I decline\nto argue further. Let the thing be tried.\"\n\n\"NO,\" said Wish, and made a step and ceased, and Clayton raised his\nhands once more to repeat the spirit's passing.\n\nBy that time, you know, we were all in a state of tension--largely\nbecause of the behaviour of Wish. We sat all of us with our eyes on\nClayton--I, at least, with a sort of tight, stiff feeling about me as\nthough from the back of my skull to the middle of my thighs my body had\nbeen changed to steel. And there, with a gravity that was imperturbably\nserene, Clayton bowed and swayed and waved his hands and arms before us.\nAs he drew towards the end one piled up, one tingled in one's teeth. The\nlast gesture, I have said, was to swing the arms out wide open, with the\nface held up. And when at last he swung out to this closing gesture I\nceased even to breathe. It was ridiculous, of course, but you know that\nghost-story feeling. It was after dinner, in a queer, old shadowy house.\nWould he, after all--?\n\nThere he stood for one stupendous moment, with his arms open and his\nupturned face, assured and bright, in the glare of the hanging lamp. We\nhung through that moment as if it were an age, and then came from all\nof us something that was half a sigh of infinite relief and half a\nreassuring \"NO!\" For visibly--he wasn't going. It was all nonsense. He\nhad told an idle story, and carried it almost to conviction, that was\nall!... And then in that moment the face of Clayton, changed.\n\nIt changed. It changed as a lit house changes when its lights are\nsuddenly extinguished. His eyes were suddenly eyes that were fixed, his\nsmile was frozen on his lips, and he stood there still. He stood there,\nvery gently swaying.\n\nThat moment, too, was an age. And then, you know, chairs were scraping,\nthings were falling, and we were all moving. His knees seemed to give,\nand he fell forward, and Evans rose and caught him in his arms....\n\nIt stunned us all. For a minute I suppose no one said a coherent thing.\nWe believed it, yet could not believe it.... I came out of a muddled\nstupefaction to find myself kneeling beside him, and his vest and shirt\nwere torn open, and Sanderson's hand lay on his heart....\n\nWell--the simple fact before us could very well wait our convenience;\nthere was no hurry for us to comprehend. It lay there for an hour; it\nlies athwart my memory, black and amazing still, to this day. Clayton\nhad, indeed, passed into the world that lies so near to and so far from\nour own, and he had gone thither by the only road that mortal man\nmay take. But whether he did indeed pass there by that poor ghost's\nincantation, or whether he was stricken suddenly by apoplexy in the\nmidst of an idle tale--as the coroner's jury would have us believe--is\nno matter for my judging; it is just one of those inexplicable riddles\nthat must remain unsolved until the final solution of all things shall\ncome. All I certainly know is that, in the very moment, in the very\ninstant, of concluding those passes, he changed, and staggered, and fell\ndown before us--dead!\n\n\n\n\n7. JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD\n\n\"It isn't every one who's been a god,\" said the sunburnt man. \"But it's\nhappened to me. Among other things.\"\n\nI intimated my sense of his condescension.\n\n\"It don't leave much for ambition, does it?\" said the sunburnt man.\n\n\"I was one of those men who were saved from the Ocean Pioneer. Gummy!\nhow time flies! It's twenty years ago. I doubt if you'll remember\nanything of the Ocean Pioneer?\"\n\nThe name was familiar, and I tried to recall when and where I had read\nit. The Ocean Pioneer? \"Something about gold dust,\" I said vaguely, \"but\nthe precise--\"\n\n\"That's it,\" he said. \"In a beastly little channel she hadn't no\nbusiness in--dodging pirates. It was before they'd put the kybosh on\nthat business. And there'd been volcanoes or something and all the rocks\nwas wrong. There's places about by Soona where you fair have to follow\nthe rocks about to see where they're going next. Down she went in twenty\nfathoms before you could have dealt for whist, with fifty thousand\npounds worth of gold aboard, it was said, in one form or another.\"\n\n\"Survivors?\"\n\n\"Three.\"\n\n\"I remember the case now,\" I said. \"There was something about salvage--\"\n\nBut at the word salvage the sunburnt man exploded into language so\nextraordinarily horrible that I stopped aghast. He came down to more\nordinary swearing, and pulled himself up abruptly. \"Excuse me,\" he said,\n\"but--salvage!\"\n\nHe leant over towards me. \"I was in that job,\" he said. \"Tried to make\nmyself a rich man, and got made a god instead. I've got my feelings--\n\n\"It ain't all jam being a god,\" said the sunburnt man, and for some time\nconversed by means of such pithy but unprogressive axioms. At last he\ntook up his tale again.\n\n\"There was me,\" said the sunburnt man, \"and a seaman named Jacobs, and\nAlways, the mate of the Ocean Pioneer. And him it was that set the\nwhole thing going. I remember him now, when we was in the jolly-boat,\nsuggesting it all to our minds just by one sentence. He was a wonderful\nhand at suggesting things. 'There was forty thousand pounds,' he said,\n'on that ship, and it's for me to say just where she went down.' It\ndidn't need much brains to tumble to that. And he was the leader from\nthe first to the last. He got hold of the Sanderses and their brig; they\nwere brothers, and the brig was the Pride of Banya, and he it was bought\nthe diving-dress--a second-hand one with a compressed air apparatus\ninstead of pumping. He'd have done the diving too, if it hadn't made him\nsick going down. And the salvage people were mucking about with a chart\nhe'd cooked up, as solemn as could be, at Starr Race, a hundred and\ntwenty miles away.\n\n\"I can tell you we was a happy lot aboard that brig, jokes and drink\nand bright hopes all the time. It all seemed so neat and clean and\nstraightforward, and what rough chaps call a 'cert.' And we used to\nspeculate how the other blessed lot, the proper salvagers, who'd started\ntwo days before us, were getting on, until our sides fairly ached. We\nall messed together in the Sanderses' cabin--it was a curious crew, all\nofficers and no men--and there stood the diving-dress waiting its turn.\nYoung Sanders was a humorous sort of chap, and there certainly was\nsomething funny in the confounded thing's great fat head and its stare,\nand he made us see it too. 'Jimmie Goggles,' he used to call it, and\ntalk to it like a Christian. Asked if he was married, and how Mrs.\nGoggles was, and all the little Goggleses. Fit to make you split. And\nevery blessed day all of us used to drink the health of Jimmy Goggles in\nrum, and unscrew his eye and pour a glass of rum in him, until, instead\nof that nasty mackintosheriness, he smelt as nice in his inside as\na cask of rum. It was jolly times we had in those days, I can tell\nyou--little suspecting, poor chaps! what was a-coming.\n\n\"We weren't going to throw away our chances by any blessed hurry, you\nknow, and we spent a whole day sounding our way towards where the Ocean\nPioneer had gone down, right between two chunks of ropy grey rock--lava\nrocks that rose nearly out of the water. We had to lay off about half a\nmile to get a safe anchorage, and there was a thundering row who should\nstop on board. And there she lay just as she had gone down, so that\nyou could see the top of the masts that was still standing perfectly\ndistinctly. The row ending in all coming in the boat. I went down in the\ndiving-dress on Friday morning directly it was light.\n\n\"What a surprise it was! I can see it all now quite distinctly. It was\na queer-looking place, and the light was just coming. People over here\nthink every blessed place in the tropics is a flat shore and palm trees\nand surf, bless 'em! This place, for instance, wasn't a bit that way.\nNot common rocks they were, undermined by waves; but great curved banks\nlike ironwork cinder heaps, with green slime below, and thorny shrubs\nand things just waving upon them here and there, and the water glassy\ncalm and clear, and showing you a kind of dirty grey-black shine, with\nhuge flaring red-brown weeds spreading motionless, and crawling and\ndarting things going through it. And far away beyond the ditches and\npools and the heaps was a forest on the mountain flank, growing again\nafter the fires and cinder showers of the last eruption. And the other\nway forest, too, and a kind of broken--what is it?--ambytheatre of black\nand rusty cinders rising out of it all, and the sea in a kind of bay in\nthe middle.\n\n\"The dawn, I say, was just coming, and there wasn't much colour about\nthings, and not a human being but ourselves anywhere in sight up or down\nthe channel. Except the Pride of Banya, lying out beyond a lump of rocks\ntowards the line of the sea.\n\n\"Not a human being in sight,\" he repeated, and paused.\n\n\"I don't know where they came from, not a bit. And we were feeling so\nsafe that we were all alone that poor young Sanders was a-singing. I was\nin Jimmy Goggles, all except the helmet. 'Easy,' says Always, 'there's\nher mast.' And after I'd had just one squint over the gunwale, I caught\nup the bogey and almost tipped out as old Sanders brought the boat\nround. When the windows were screwed and everything was all right, I\nshut the valve from the air belt in order to help my sinking, and\njumped overboard, feet foremost--for we hadn't a ladder. I left the boat\npitching, and all of them staring down into the water after me, as my\nhead sank down into the weeds and blackness that lay about the mast.\nI suppose nobody, not the most cautious chap in the world, would have\nbothered about a lookout at such a desolate place. It stunk of solitude.\n\n\"Of course you must understand that I was a greenhorn at diving. None of\nus were divers. We'd had to muck about with the thing to get the way of\nit, and this was the first time I'd been deep. It feels damnable. Your\nears hurt beastly. I don't know if you've ever hurt yourself yawning or\nsneezing, but it takes you like that, only ten times worse. And a pain\nover the eyebrows here--splitting--and a feeling like influenza in the\nhead. And it isn't all heaven in your lungs and things. And going down\nfeels like the beginning of a lift, only it keeps on. And you can't turn\nyour head to see what's above you, and you can't get a fair squint at\nwhat's happening to your feet without bending down something painful.\nAnd being deep it was dark, let alone the blackness of the ashes and mud\nthat formed the bottom. It was like going down out of the dawn back into\nthe night, so to speak.\n\n\"The mast came up like a ghost out of the black, and then a lot of\nfishes, and then a lot of flapping red seaweed, and then whack I came\nwith a kind of dull bang on the deck of the Ocean Pioneer, and the\nfishes that had been feeding on the dead rose about me like a swarm of\nflies from road stuff in summer time. I turned on the compressed air\nagain--for the suit was a bit thick and mackintoshery after all, in\nspite of the rum--and stood recovering myself. It struck coolish down\nthere, and that helped take off the stuffiness a bit.\n\n\"When I began to feel easier, I started looking about me. It was\nan extraordinary sight. Even the light was extraordinary, a kind of\nreddy-coloured twilight, on account of the streamers of seaweed that\nfloated up on either side of the ship. And far overhead just a moony,\ndeep green-blue. The deck of the ship, except for a slight list to\nstarboard, was level, and lay all dark and long between the weeds, clear\nexcept where the masts had snapped when she rolled, and vanishing into\nblack night towards the forecastle. There wasn't any dead on the decks,\nmost were in the weeds alongside, I suppose; but afterwards I found two\nskeletons lying in the passengers' cabins, where death had come to them.\nIt was curious to stand on that deck and recognise it all, bit by bit; a\nplace against the rail where I'd been fond of smoking by starlight, and\nthe corner where an old chap from Sydney used to flirt with a widow we\nhad aboard. A comfortable couple they'd been, only a month ago, and now\nyou couldn't have got a meal for a baby crab off either of them.\n\n\"I've always had a bit of a philosophical turn, and I dare say I spent\nthe best part of five minutes in such thoughts before I went below\nto find where the blessed dust was stored. It was slow work hunting,\nfeeling it was for the most part, pitchy dark, with confusing blue\ngleams down the companion. And there were things moving about, a dab at\nmy glass once, and once a pinch at my leg. Crabs, I expect. I kicked a\nlot of loose stuff that puzzled me, and stooped and picked up something\nall knobs and spikes. What do you think? Backbone! But I never had\nany particular feeling for bones. We had talked the affair over pretty\nthoroughly, and Always knew just where the stuff was stowed. I found it\nthat trip. I lifted a box one end an inch or more.\"\n\nHe broke off in his story. \"I've lifted it,\" he said, \"as near as that!\nForty thousand pounds worth of pure gold! Gold! I shouted inside my\nhelmet as a kind of cheer and hurt my ears. I was getting confounded\nstuffy and tired by this time--I must have been down twenty-five minutes\nor more--and I thought this was good enough. I went up the companion\nagain, and as my eyes came up flush with the deck, a thundering great\ncrab gave a kind of hysterical jump and went scuttling off sideways.\nQuite a start it gave me. I stood up clear on deck and shut the valve\nbehind the helmet to let the air accumulate to carry me up again--I\nnoticed a kind of whacking from above, as though they were hitting the\nwater with an oar, but I didn't look up. I fancied they were signalling\nme to come up.\n\n\"And then something shot down by me--something heavy, and stood a-quiver\nin the planks. I looked, and there was a long knife I'd seen young\nSanders handling. Thinks I, he's dropped it, and I was still calling him\nthis kind of fool and that--for it might have hurt me serious--when I\nbegan to lift and drive up towards the daylight. Just about the level\nof the top spars of the Ocean Pioneer, whack! I came against something\nsinking down, and a boot knocked in front of my helmet. Then something\nelse, struggling frightful. It was a big weight atop of me, whatever it\nwas, and moving and twisting about. I'd have thought it a big octopus,\nor some such thing, if it hadn't been for the boot. But octopuses don't\nwear boots. It was all in a moment, of course. I felt myself sinking\ndown again, and I threw my arms about to keep steady, and the whole lot\nrolled free of me and shot down as I went up--\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"I saw young Sanders's face, over a naked black shoulder, and a spear\ndriven clean through his neck, and out of his mouth and neck what looked\nlike spirts of pink smoke in the water. And down they went clutching\none another, and turning over, and both too far gone to leave go. And\nin another second my helmet came a whack, fit to split, against the\nniggers' canoe. It was niggers! Two canoes full.\n\n\"It was lively times, I tell you! Overboard came Always with three\nspears in him. There was the legs of three or four black chaps kicking\nabout me in the water. I couldn't see much, but I saw the game was up at\na glance, gave my valve a tremendous twist, and went bubbling down again\nafter poor Always, in as awful a state of scare and astonishment as you\ncan well imagine. I passed young Sanders and the nigger going up again\nand struggling still a bit, and in another moment I was standing in the\ndim again on the deck of the Ocean Pioneer.\n\n\"'Gummy,' thinks I, 'here's a fix!' Niggers? At first I couldn't see\nanything for it but Stifle below or Stabs above. I didn't properly\nunderstand how much air there was to last me, but I didn't feel like\nstanding very much more of it down below. I was hot and frightfully\nheady--quite apart from the blue funk I was in. We'd never repined with\nthese beastly natives, filthy Papuan beasts. It wasn't any good, coming\nup where I was, but I had to do something. On the spur of the moment, I\nclambered over the side of the brig and landed among the weeds, and set\noff through the darkness as fast as I could. I just stopped once and\nknelt, and twisted back my head in the helmet and had a look up. It was\na most extraordinary bright green-blue above, and the two canoes and the\nboat floating there very small and distant like a kind of twisted H. And\nit made me feel sick to squint up at it, and think what the pitching and\nswaying of the three meant.\n\n\"It was just about the most horrible ten minutes I ever had, blundering\nabout in that darkness, pressure something awful, like being buried in\nsand, pain across the chest, sick with funk, and breathing nothing as it\nseemed but the smell of rum and mackintosh. Gummy! After a bit, I found\nmyself going up a steepish sort of slope. I had another squint to see\nif anything was visible of the canoes and boats, and then kept on. I\nstopped with my head a foot from the surface, and tried to see where I\nwas going, but, of course, nothing was to be seen but the reflection of\nthe bottom. Then out I dashed like knocking my head through a mirror.\nDirectly I got my eyes out of the water, I saw I'd come up a kind of\nbeach near the forest. I had a look round, but the natives and the brig\nwere both hidden by a big, hummucky heap of twisted lava, the born fool\nin me suggested a run for the woods. I didn't take the helmet off, but\neased open one of the windows, and, after a bit of a pant, went on out\nof the water. You'd hardly imagine how clean and light the air tasted.\n\n\"Of course, with four inches of lead in your boot soles, and your head\nin a copper knob the size of a football, and been thirty-five minutes\nunder water, you don't break any records running. I ran like a ploughboy\ngoing to work. And half way to the trees I saw a dozen niggers or more,\ncoming out in a gaping, astonished sort of way to meet me.\n\n\"I just stopped dead, and cursed myself for all the fools out of London.\nI had about as much chance of cutting back to the water as a turned\nturtle. I just screwed up my window again to leave my hands free, and\nwaited for them. There wasn't anything else for me to do.\n\n\"But they didn't come on very much. I began to suspect why. 'Jimmy\nGoggles,' I says, 'it's your beauty does it.' I was inclined to be\na little light-headed, I think, with all these dangers about and the\nchange in the pressure of the blessed air. 'Who're ye staring at?'\nI said, as if the savages could hear me. 'What d'ye take me for? I'm\nhanged if I don't give you something to stare at,' I said, and with that\nI screwed up the escape valve and turned on the compressed air from the\nbelt, until I was swelled out like a blown frog. Regular imposing it\nmust have been. I'm blessed if they'd come on a step; and presently one\nand then another went down on their hands and knees. They didn't know\nwhat to make of me, and they was doing the extra polite, which was very\nwise and reasonable of them. I had half a mind to edge back seaward and\ncut and run, but it seemed too hopeless. A step back and they'd have\nbeen after me. And out of sheer desperation I began to march towards\nthem up the beach, with slow, heavy steps, and waving my blown-out arms\nabout, in a dignified manner. And inside of me I was singing as small as\na tomtit.\n\n\"But there's nothing like a striking appearance to help a man over a\ndifficulty,--I've found that before and since. People like ourselves,\nwho're up to diving-dresses by the time we're seven, can scarcely\nimagine the effect of one on a simple-minded savage. One or two of these\nniggers cut and run, the others started in a great hurry trying to knock\ntheir brains out on the ground. And on I went as slow and solemn and\nsilly-looking and artful as a jobbing plumber. It was evident they took\nme for something immense.\n\n\"Then up jumped one and began pointing, making extraordinary gestures\nto me as he did so, and all the others began sharing their attention\nbetween me and something out at sea. 'What's the matter now?' I said. I\nturned slowly on account of my dignity, and there I saw, coming round\na point, the poor old Pride of Banya towed by a couple of canoes. The\nsight fairly made me sick. But they evidently expected some recognition,\nso I waved my arms in a striking sort of non-committal manner. And then\nI turned and stalked on towards the trees again. At that time I was\npraying like mad, I remember, over and over again: 'Lord help me through\nwith it! Lord help me through with it!' It's only fools who know nothing\nof dangers can afford to laugh at praying.\n\n\"But these niggers weren't going to let me walk through and away like\nthat. They started a kind of bowing dance about me, and sort of pressed\nme to take a pathway that lay through the trees. It was clear to me they\ndidn't take me for a British citizen, whatever else they thought of\nme, and for my own part I was never less anxious to own up to the old\ncountry.\n\n\"You'd hardly believe it, perhaps, unless you're familiar with savages,\nbut these poor misguided, ignorant creatures took me straight to their\nkind of joss place to present me to the blessed old black stone there.\nBy this time I was beginning to sort of realise the depth of their\nignorance, and directly I set eyes on this deity I took my cue. I\nstarted a baritone howl, 'wow-wow,' very long on one note, and began\nwaving my arms about a lot, and then very slowly and ceremoniously\nturned their image over on its side and sat down on it. I wanted to sit\ndown badly, for diving-dresses ain't much wear in the tropics. Or, to\nput it different like, they're a sight too much. It took away their\nbreath, I could see, my sitting on their joss, but in less time than a\nminute they made up their minds and were hard at work worshipping me.\nAnd I can tell you I felt a bit relieved to see things turning out so\nwell, in spite of the weight on my shoulders and feet.\n\n\"But what made me anxious was what the chaps in the canoes might think\nwhen they came back. If they'd seen me in the boat before I went down,\nand without the helmet on--for they might have been spying and hiding\nsince over night--they would very likely take a different view from the\nothers. I was in a deuce of a stew about that for hours, as it seemed,\nuntil the shindy of the arrival began.\n\n\"But they took it down--the whole blessed village took it down. At the\ncost of sitting up stiff and stern, as much like those sitting Egyptian\nimages one sees as I could manage, for pretty nearly twelve hours, I\nshould guess at least, on end, I got over it. You'd hardly think what\nit meant in that heat and stink. I don't think any of them dreamt of the\nman inside. I was just a wonderful leathery great joss that had come\nup with luck out of the water. But the fatigue! the heat! the beastly\ncloseness! the mackintosheriness and the rum! and the fuss! They lit a\nstinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought\nin a lot of gory muck--the worst parts of what they were feasting on\noutside, the Beasts--and burnt it all in my honour. I was getting a bit\nhungry, but I understand now how gods manage to do without eating, what\nwith the smell of burnt offerings about them. And they brought in a lot\nof the stuff they'd got off the brig and, among other stuff, what I was\na bit relieved to see, the kind of pneumatic pump that was used for the\ncompressed air affair, and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and\ndanced about me something disgraceful. It's extraordinary the different\nways different people have of showing respect. If I'd had a hatchet\nhandy I'd have gone for the lot of them--they made me feel that wild.\nAll this time I sat as stiff as company, not knowing anything better to\ndo. And at last, when nightfall came, and the wattle joss-house place\ngot a bit too shadowy for their taste--all these here savages are afraid\nof the dark, you know--and I started a sort of 'Moo' noise, they built\nbig bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my\nhut, free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over, and feel\njust as bad as I liked. And, Lord! I was sick.\n\n\"I was weak and hungry, and my mind kept on behaving like a beetle on a\npin, tremendous activity and nothing done at the end of it. Come round\njust where it was before. There was sorrowing for the other chaps,\nbeastly drunkards certainly, but not deserving such a fate, and young\nSanders with the spear through his neck wouldn't go out of my mind.\nThere was the treasure down there in the Ocean Pioneer, and how one\nmight get it and hide it somewhere safer, and get away and come back for\nit. And there was the puzzle where to get anything to eat. I tell you\nI was fair rambling. I was afraid to ask by signs for food, for fear of\nbehaving too human, and so there I sat and hungered until very near\nthe dawn. Then the village got a bit quiet, and I couldn't stand it any\nlonger, and I went out and got some stuff like artichokes in a bowl\nand some sour milk. What was left of these I put away among the other\nofferings, just to give them a hint of my tastes. And in the morning\nthey came to worship, and found me sitting up stiff and respectable on\ntheir previous god, just as they'd left me overnight. I'd got my back\nagainst the central pillar of the hut, and, practically, I was asleep.\nAnd that's how I became a god among the heathen--a false god no doubt,\nand blasphemous, but one can't always pick and choose.\n\n\"Now, I don't want to crack myself up as a god beyond my merits, but I\nmust confess that while I was god to these people they was extraordinary\nsuccessful. I don't say there's anything in it, mind you. They won\na battle with another tribe--I got a lot of offerings I didn't want\nthrough it--they had wonderful fishing, and their crop of pourra was\nexceptional fine. And they counted the capture of the brig among the\nbenefits I brought 'em. I must say I don't think that was a poor record\nfor a perfectly new hand. And, though perhaps you'd scarcely credit it,\nI was the tribal god of those beastly savages for pretty nearly four\nmonths....\n\n\"What else could I do, man? But I didn't wear that diving-dress all the\ntime. I made 'em rig me up a sort of holy of holies, and a deuce of a\ntime I had too, making them understand what it was I wanted them to do.\nThat indeed was the great difficulty--making them understand my wishes.\nI couldn't let myself down by talking their lingo badly--even if I'd\nbeen able to speak at all--and I couldn't go flapping a lot of gestures\nat them. So I drew pictures in sand and sat down beside them and hooted\nlike one o'clock. Sometimes they did the things I wanted all right,\nand sometimes they did them all wrong. They was always very willing,\ncertainly. All the while I was puzzling how I was to get the confounded\nbusiness settled. Every night before the dawn I used to march out in\nfull rig and go off to a place where I could see the channel in which\nthe Ocean Pioneer lay sunk, and once even, one moonlight night, I tried\nto walk out to her, but the weeds and rocks and dark clean beat me. I\ndidn't get back till full day, and then I found all those silly niggers\nout on the beach praying their sea-god to return to them. I was that\nvexed and tired, messing and tumbling about, and coming up and going\ndown again, I could have punched their silly heads all round when they\nstarted rejoicing. I'm hanged if I like so much ceremony.\n\n\"And then came the missionary. That missionary! It was in the afternoon,\nand I was sitting in state in my outer temple place, sitting on that old\nblack stone of theirs when he came. I heard a row outside and jabbering,\nand then his voice speaking to an interpreter. 'They worship stocks and\nstones,' he said, and I knew what was up, in a flash. I had one of my\nwindows out for comfort, and I sang out straight away on the spur of\nthe moment. 'Stocks and stones!' I says. 'You come inside,' I says, 'and\nI'll punch your blooming head.' There was a kind of silence and more\njabbering, and in he came, Bible in hand, after the manner of them--a\nlittle sandy chap in specks and a pith helmet. I flatter myself that me\nsitting there in the shadows, with my copper head and my big goggles,\nstruck him a bit of a heap at first. 'Well,' I says, 'how's the trade in\ncalico?' for I don't hold with missionaries.\n\n\"I had a lark with that missionary. He was a raw hand, and quite\noutclassed with a man like me. He gasped out who was I, and I told him\nto read the inscription at my feet if he wanted to know. Down he goes\nto read, and his interpreter, being of course as superstitious as any of\nthem, took it as an act of worship and plumped down like a shot. All my\npeople gave a howl of triumph, and there wasn't any more business to be\ndone in my village after that journey, not by the likes of him.\n\n\"But, of course, I was a fool to choke him off like that. If I'd had any\nsense I should have told him straight away of the treasure and taken him\ninto Co. I've no doubt he'd have come into Co. A child, with a few hours\nto think it over, could have seen the connection between my diving-dress\nand the loss of the Ocean Pioneer. A week after he left I went out\none morning and saw the Motherhood, the salver's ship from Starr Race,\ntowing up the channel and sounding. The whole blessed game was up, and\nall my trouble thrown away. Gummy! How wild I felt! And guying it in\nthat stinking silly dress! Four months!\"\n\nThe sunburnt man's story degenerated again. \"Think of it,\" he said, when\nhe emerged to linguistic purity once more. \"Forty thousand pounds worth\nof gold.\"\n\n\"Did the little missionary come back?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes! Bless him! And he pledged his reputation there was a man\ninside the god, and started out to see as much with tremendous ceremony.\nBut there wasn't--he got sold again. I always did hate scenes and\nexplanations, and long before he came I was out of it all--going home to\nBanya along the coast, hiding in bushes by day, and thieving food from\nthe villages by night. Only weapon, a spear. No clothes, no money.\nNothing. My face was my fortune, as the saying is. And just a squeak\nof eight thousand pounds of gold--fifth share. But the natives cut up\nrusty, thank goodness, because they thought it was him had driven their\nluck away.\"\n\n\n\n\n8. THE NEW ACCELERATOR\n\nCertainly, if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin\nit is my good friend Professor Gibberne. I have heard before of\ninvestigators overshooting the mark, but never quite to the extent that\nhe has done. He has really, this time at any rate, without any touch of\nexaggeration in the phrase, found something to revolutionise human life.\nAnd that when he was simply seeking an all-round nervous stimulant to\nbring languid people up to the stresses of these pushful days. I have\ntasted the stuff now several times, and I cannot do better than describe\nthe effect the thing had on me. That there are astonishing experiences\nin store for all in search of new sensations will become apparent\nenough.\n\nProfessor Gibberne, as many people know, is my neighbour in Folkestone.\nUnless my memory plays me a trick, his portrait at various ages has\nalready appeared in The Strand Magazine--I think late in 1899; but I am\nunable to look it up because I have lent that volume to some one who has\nnever sent it back. The reader may, perhaps, recall the high forehead\nand the singularly long black eyebrows that give such a Mephistophelian\ntouch to his face. He occupies one of those pleasant little detached\nhouses in the mixed style that make the western end of the Upper\nSandgate Road so interesting. His is the one with the Flemish gables and\nthe Moorish portico, and it is in the little room with the mullioned bay\nwindow that he works when he is down here, and in which of an evening\nwe have so often smoked and talked together. He is a mighty jester, but,\nbesides, he likes to talk to me about his work; he is one of those men\nwho find a help and stimulus in talking, and so I have been able to\nfollow the conception of the New Accelerator right up from a very early\nstage. Of course, the greater portion of his experimental work is not\ndone in Folkestone, but in Gower Street, in the fine new laboratory next\nto the hospital that he has been the first to use.\n\nAs every one knows, or at least as all intelligent people know, the\nspecial department in which Gibberne has gained so great and deserved a\nreputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon the nervous\nsystem. Upon soporifics, sedatives, and anaesthetics he is, I am told,\nunequalled. He is also a chemist of considerable eminence, and I suppose\nin the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the\nganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of\nhis making, little glades of illumination, that, until he sees fit to\npublish his results, are still inaccessible to every other living man.\nAnd in the last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon this\nquestion of nervous stimulants, and already, before the discovery of the\nNew Accelerator, very successful with them. Medical science has to thank\nhim for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators\nof unrivalled value to practising men. In cases of exhaustion the\npreparation known as Gibberne's B Syrup has, I suppose, saved more lives\nalready than any lifeboat round the coast.\n\n\"But none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet,\" he told me\nnearly a year ago. \"Either they increase the central energy without\naffecting the nerves or they simply increase the available energy by\nlowering the nervous conductivity; and all of them are unequal and local\nin their operation. One wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves\nthe brain stupefied, one gets at the brain champagne fashion and does\nnothing good for the solar plexus, and what I want--and what, if it's an\nearthly possibility, I mean to have--is a stimulant that stimulates all\nround, that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the\ntip of your great toe, and makes you go two--or even three--to everybody\nelse's one. Eh? That's the thing I'm after.\"\n\n\"It would tire a man,\" I said.\n\n\"Not a doubt of it. And you'd eat double or treble--and all that. But\njust think what the thing would mean. Imagine yourself with a little\nphial like this\"--he held up a little bottle of green glass and marked\nhis points with it--\"and in this precious phial is the power to think\ntwice as fast, move twice as quickly, do twice as much work in a given\ntime as you could otherwise do.\"\n\n\"But is such a thing possible?\"\n\n\"I believe so. If it isn't, I've wasted my time for a year. These\nvarious preparations of the hypophosphites, for example, seem to show\nthat something of the sort... Even if it was only one and a half times\nas fast it would do.\"\n\n\"It WOULD do,\" I said.\n\n\"If you were a statesman in a corner, for example, time rushing up\nagainst you, something urgent to be done, eh?\"\n\n\"He could dose his private secretary,\" I said.\n\n\"And gain--double time. And think if YOU, for example, wanted to finish\na book.\"\n\n\"Usually,\" I said, \"I wish I'd never begun 'em.\"\n\n\"Or a doctor, driven to death, wants to sit down and think out a case.\nOr a barrister--or a man cramming for an examination.\"\n\n\"Worth a guinea a drop,\" said I, \"and more to men like that.\"\n\n\"And in a duel, again,\" said Gibberne, \"where it all depends on your\nquickness in pulling the trigger.\"\n\n\"Or in fencing,\" I echoed.\n\n\"You see,\" said Gibberne, \"if I get it as an all-round thing it will\nreally do you no harm at all--except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree\nit brings you nearer old age. You will just have lived twice to other\npeople's once--\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" I meditated, \"in a duel--it would be fair?\"\n\n\"That's a question for the seconds,\" said Gibberne.\n\nI harked back further. \"And you really think such a thing IS possible?\"\nI said.\n\n\"As possible,\" said Gibberne, and glanced at something that went\nthrobbing by the window, \"as a motor-bus. As a matter of fact--\"\n\nHe paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the edge of his\ndesk with the green phial. \"I think I know the stuff.... Already I've\ngot something coming.\" The nervous smile upon his face betrayed the\ngravity of his revelation. He rarely talked of his actual experimental\nwork unless things were very near the end. \"And it may be, it may be--I\nshouldn't be surprised--it may even do the thing at a greater rate than\ntwice.\"\n\n\"It will be rather a big thing,\" I hazarded.\n\n\"It will be, I think, rather a big thing.\"\n\nBut I don't think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be, for all\nthat.\n\nI remember we had several talks about the stuff after that. \"The New\nAccelerator\" he called it, and his tone about it grew more confident on\neach occasion. Sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected physiological\nresults its use might have, and then he would get a little unhappy; at\nothers he was frankly mercenary, and we debated long and anxiously how\nthe preparation might be turned to commercial account. \"It's a good\nthing,\" said Gibberne, \"a tremendous thing. I know I'm giving the world\nsomething, and I think it only reasonable we should expect the world to\npay. The dignity of science is all very well, but I think somehow I must\nhave the monopoly of the stuff for, say, ten years. I don't see why ALL\nthe fun in life should go to the dealers in ham.\"\n\nMy own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time.\nI have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind. I\nhave always been given to paradoxes about space and time, and it seemed\nto me that Gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute\nacceleration of life. Suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a\npreparation: he would live an active and record life indeed, but he\nwould be an adult at eleven, middle-aged at twenty-five, and by thirty\nwell on the road to senile decay. It seemed to me that so far Gibberne\nwas only going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what Nature\nhas done for the Jews and Orientals, who are men in their teens and aged\nby fifty, and quicker in thought and act than we are all the time. The\nmarvel of drugs has always been great to my mind; you can madden a man,\ncalm a man, make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log,\nquicken this passion and allay that, all by means of drugs, and here was\na new miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors\nuse! But Gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to enter\nvery keenly into my aspect of the question.\n\nIt was the 7th or 8th of August when he told me the distillation that\nwould decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we\ntalked, and it was on the 10th that he told me the thing was done and\nthe New Accelerator a tangible reality in the world. I met him as I was\ngoing up the Sandgate Hill towards Folkestone--I think I was going to\nget my hair cut, and he came hurrying down to meet me--I suppose he was\ncoming to my house to tell me at once of his success. I remember that\nhis eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed, and I noted even\nthen the swift alacrity of his step.\n\n\"It's done,\" he cried, and gripped my hand, speaking very fast; \"it's\nmore than done. Come up to my house and see.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Really!\" he shouted. \"Incredibly! Come up and see.\"\n\n\"And it does--twice?\n\n\"It does more, much more. It scares me. Come up and see the stuff. Taste\nit! Try it! It's the most amazing stuff on earth.\" He gripped my arm\nand, walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot, went shouting\nwith me up the hill. A whole char-a-banc-ful of people turned and stared\nat us in unison after the manner of people in chars-a-banc. It was one\nof those hot, clear days that Folkestone sees so much of, every colour\nincredibly bright and every outline hard. There was a breeze, of course,\nbut not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions to keep me\ncool and dry. I panted for mercy.\n\n\"I'm not walking fast, am I?\" cried Gibberne, and slackened his pace to\na quick march.\n\n\"You've been taking some of this stuff,\" I puffed.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"At the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker\nfrom which I had washed out the last traces of the stuff. I took some\nlast night, you know. But that is ancient history, now.\"\n\n\"And it goes twice?\" I said, nearing his doorway in a grateful\nperspiration.\n\n\"It goes a thousand times, many thousand times!\" cried Gibberne, with a\ndramatic gesture, flinging open his Early English carved oak gate.\n\n\"Phew!\" said I, and followed him to the door.\n\n\"I don't know how many times it goes,\" he said, with his latch-key in\nhis hand.\n\n\"And you--\"\n\n\"It throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology, it kicks the theory\nof vision into a perfectly new shape!... Heaven knows how many thousand\ntimes. We'll try all that after--The thing is to try the stuff now.\"\n\n\"Try the stuff?\" I said, as we went along the passage.\n\n\"Rather,\" said Gibberne, turning on me in his study. \"There it is in\nthat little green phial there! Unless you happen to be afraid?\"\n\nI am a careful man by nature, and only theoretically adventurous. I WAS\nafraid. But on the other hand there is pride.\n\n\"Well,\" I haggled. \"You say you've tried it?\"\n\n\"I've tried it,\" he said, \"and I don't look hurt by it, do I? I don't\neven look livery and I FEEL--\"\n\nI sat down. \"Give me the potion,\" I said. \"If the worst comes to the\nworst it will save having my hair cut, and that I think is one of the\nmost hateful duties of a civilised man. How do you take the mixture?\"\n\n\"With water,\" said Gibberne, whacking down a carafe.\n\nHe stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy chair; his\nmanner was suddenly affected by a touch of the Harley Street specialist.\n\"It's rum stuff, you know,\" he said.\n\nI made a gesture with my hand.\n\n\"I must warn you in the first place as soon as you've got it down to\nshut your eyes, and open them very cautiously in a minute or so's\ntime. One still sees. The sense of vision is a question of length of\nvibration, and not of multitude of impacts; but there's a kind of shock\nto the retina, a nasty giddy confusion just at the time, if the eyes are\nopen. Keep 'em shut.\"\n\n\"Shut,\" I said. \"Good!\"\n\n\"And the next thing is, keep still. Don't begin to whack about. You\nmay fetch something a nasty rap if you do. Remember you will be going\nseveral thousand times faster than you ever did before, heart, lungs,\nmuscles, brain--everything--and you will hit hard without knowing\nit. You won't know it, you know. You'll feel just as you do now. Only\neverything in the world will seem to be going ever so many thousand\ntimes slower than it ever went before. That's what makes it so deuced\nqueer.\"\n\n\"Lor',\" I said. \"And you mean--\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" said he, and took up a little measure. He glanced at the\nmaterial on his desk. \"Glasses,\" he said, \"water. All here. Mustn't take\ntoo much for the first attempt.\"\n\nThe little phial glucked out its precious contents.\n\n\"Don't forget what I told you,\" he said, turning the contents of the\nmeasure into a glass in the manner of an Italian waiter measuring\nwhisky. \"Sit with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for\ntwo minutes,\" he said. \"Then you will hear me speak.\"\n\nHe added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass.\n\n\"By-the-by,\" he said, \"don't put your glass down. Keep it in your hand\nand rest your hand on your knee. Yes--so. And now--\"\n\nHe raised his glass.\n\n\"The New Accelerator,\" I said.\n\n\"The New Accelerator,\" he answered, and we touched glasses and drank,\nand instantly I closed my eyes.\n\nYou know that blank non-existence into which one drops when one has\ntaken \"gas.\" For an indefinite interval it was like that. Then I heard\nGibberne telling me to wake up, and I stirred and opened my eyes. There\nhe stood as he had been standing, glass still in hand. It was empty,\nthat was all the difference.\n\n\"Well?\" said I.\n\n\"Nothing out of the way?\"\n\n\"Nothing. A slight feeling of exhilaration, perhaps. Nothing more.\"\n\n\"Sounds?\"\n\n\"Things are still,\" I said. \"By Jove! yes! They ARE still. Except the\nsort of faint pat, patter, like rain falling on different things. What\nis it?\"\n\n\"Analysed sounds,\" I think he said, but I am not sure. He glanced at the\nwindow. \"Have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way\nbefore?\"\n\nI followed his eyes, and there was the end of the curtain, frozen, as it\nwere, corner high, in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze.\n\n\"No,\" said I; \"that's odd.\"\n\n\"And here,\" he said, and opened the hand that held the glass. Naturally\nI winced, expecting the glass to smash. But so far from smashing it did\nnot even seem to stir; it hung in mid-air--motionless.\n\n\"Roughly speaking,\" said Gibberne, \"an object in these latitudes falls\n16 feet in the first second. This glass is falling 16 feet in a second\nnow. Only, you see, it hasn't been falling yet for the hundredth part of\na second. That gives you some idea of the pace of my Accelerator.\" And\nhe waved his hand round and round, over and under the slowly sinking\nglass. Finally, he took it by the bottom, pulled it down, and placed it\nvery carefully on the table. \"Eh?\" he said to me, and laughed.\n\n\"That seems all right,\" I said, and began very gingerly to raise myself\nfrom my chair. I felt perfectly well, very light and comfortable, and\nquite confident in my mind. I was going fast all over. My heart, for\nexample, was beating a thousand times a second, but that caused me no\ndiscomfort at all. I looked out of the window. An immovable cyclist,\nhead down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving-wheel,\nscorched to overtake a galloping char-a-banc that did not stir. I gaped\nin amazement at this incredible spectacle. \"Gibberne,\" I cried, \"how\nlong will this confounded stuff last?\"\n\n\"Heaven knows!\" he answered. \"Last time I took it I went to bed and\nslept it off. I tell you, I was frightened. It must have lasted some\nminutes, I think--it seemed like hours. But after a bit it slows down\nrather suddenly, I believe.\"\n\nI was proud to observe that I did not feel frightened--I suppose because\nthere were two of us. \"Why shouldn't we go out?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"They'll see us.\"\n\n\"Not they. Goodness, no! Why, we shall be going a thousand times faster\nthan the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done. Come along! Which\nway shall we go? Window, or door?\"\n\nAnd out by the window we went.\n\nAssuredly of all the strange experiences that I have ever had, or\nimagined, or read of other people having or imagining, that little raid\nI made with Gibberne on the Folkestone Leas, under the influence of the\nNew Accelerator, was the strangest and maddest of all. We went out by\nhis gate into the road, and there we made a minute examination of the\nstatuesque passing traffic. The tops of the wheels and some of the legs\nof the horses of this char-a-banc, the end of the whip-lash and the\nlower jaw of the conductor--who was just beginning to yawn--were\nperceptibly in motion, but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance\nseemed still. And quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came\nfrom one man's throat! And as parts of this frozen edifice there were a\ndriver, you know, and a conductor, and eleven people! The effect as we\nwalked about the thing began by being madly queer, and ended by being\ndisagreeable. There they were, people like ourselves and yet not like\nourselves, frozen in careless attitudes, caught in mid-gesture. A girl\nand a man smiled at one another, a leering smile that threatened to last\nfor evermore; a woman in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail\nand stared at Gibberne's house with the unwinking stare of eternity; a\nman stroked his moustache like a figure of wax, and another stretched a\ntiresome stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat. We\nstared at them, we laughed at them, we made faces at them, and then\na sort of disgust of them came upon us, and we turned away and walked\nround in front of the cyclist towards the Leas.\n\n\"Goodness!\" cried Gibberne, suddenly; \"look there!\"\n\nHe pointed, and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air\nwith wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid\nsnail--was a bee.\n\nAnd so we came out upon the Leas. There the thing seemed madder than\never. The band was playing in the upper stand, though all the sound it\nmade for us was a low-pitched, wheezy rattle, a sort of prolonged last\nsigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow, muffled ticking\nof some monstrous clock. Frozen people stood erect, strange, silent,\nself-conscious-looking dummies hung unstably in mid-stride, promenading\nupon the grass. I passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the\nact of leaping, and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank\nto earth. \"Lord, look here!\" cried Gibberne, and we halted for a moment\nbefore a magnificent person in white faint-striped flannels, white\nshoes, and a Panama hat, who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed\nladies he had passed. A wink, studied with such leisurely deliberation\nas we could afford, is an unattractive thing. It loses any quality of\nalert gaiety, and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely\nclose, that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eyeball\nand a little line of white. \"Heaven give me memory,\" said I, \"and I will\nnever wink again.\"\n\n\"Or smile,\" said Gibberne, with his eye on the lady's answering teeth.\n\n\"It's infernally hot, somehow,\" said I. \"Let's go slower.\"\n\n\"Oh, come along!\" said Gibberne.\n\nWe picked our way among the bath-chairs in the path. Many of the people\nsitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses, but\nthe contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see.\nA purple-faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of a violent\nstruggle to refold his newspaper against the wind; there were many\nevidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to\na considerable breeze, a breeze that had no existence so far as our\nsensations went. We came out and walked a little way from the crowd, and\nturned and regarded it. To see all that multitude changed, to a picture,\nsmitten rigid, as it were, into the semblance of realistic wax, was\nimpossibly wonderful. It was absurd, of course; but it filled me with an\nirrational, an exultant sense of superior advantage. Consider the wonder\nof it! All that I had said, and thought, and done since the stuff had\nbegun to work in my veins had happened, so far as those people, so\nfar as the world in general went, in the twinkling of an eye. \"The New\nAccelerator--\" I began, but Gibberne interrupted me.\n\n\"There's that infernal old woman!\" he said.\n\n\"What old woman?\"\n\n\"Lives next door to me,\" said Gibberne. \"Has a lapdog that yaps. Gods!\nThe temptation is strong!\"\n\nThere is something very boyish and impulsive about Gibberne at times.\nBefore I could expostulate with him he had dashed forward, snatched the\nunfortunate animal out of visible existence, and was running violently\nwith it towards the cliff of the Leas. It was most extraordinary. The\nlittle brute, you know, didn't bark or wriggle or make the slightest\nsign of vitality. It kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent\nrepose, and Gibberne held it by the neck. It was like running about with\na dog of wood. \"Gibberne,\" I cried, \"put it down!\" Then I said something\nelse. \"If you run like that, Gibberne,\" I cried, \"you'll set your\nclothes on fire. Your linen trousers are going brown as it is!\"\n\nHe clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge.\n\"Gibberne,\" I cried, coming up, \"put it down. This heat is too much!\nIt's our running so! Two or three miles a second! Friction of the air!\"\n\n\"What?\" he said, glancing at the dog.\n\n\"Friction of the air,\" I shouted. \"Friction of the air. Going too fast.\nLike meteorites and things. Too hot. And, Gibberne! Gibberne! I'm all\nover pricking and a sort of perspiration. You can see people stirring\nslightly. I believe the stuff's working off! Put that dog down.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" he said.\n\n\"It's working off,\" I repeated. \"We're too hot and the stuff's working\noff! I'm wet through.\"\n\nHe stared at me. Then at the band, the wheezy rattle of whose\nperformance was certainly going faster. Then with a tremendous sweep\nof the arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went spinning upward,\nstill inanimate, and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of\nchattering people. Gibberne was gripping my elbow. \"By Jove!\" he cried.\n\"I believe--it is! A sort of hot pricking and--yes. That man's moving\nhis pocket-handkerchief! Perceptibly. We must get out of this sharp.\"\n\nBut we could not get out of it sharply enough. Luckily, perhaps! For we\nmight have run, and if we had run we should, I believe, have burst into\nflames. Almost certainly we should have burst into flames! You know we\nhad neither of us thought of that.... But before we could even begin to\nrun the action of the drug had ceased. It was the business of a minute\nfraction of a second. The effect of the New Accelerator passed like\nthe drawing of a curtain, vanished in the movement of a hand. I heard\nGibberne's voice in infinite alarm. \"Sit down,\" he said, and flop, down\nupon the turf at the edge of the Leas I sat--scorching as I sat. There\nis a patch of burnt grass there still where I sat down. The whole\nstagnation seemed to wake up as I did so, the disarticulated vibration\nof the band rushed together into a blast of music, the promenaders\nput their feet down and walked their ways, the papers and flags began\nflapping, smiles passed into words, the winker finished his wink and\nwent on his way complacently, and all the seated people moved and spoke.\n\nThe whole world had come alive again, was going as fast as we were, or\nrather we were going no faster than the rest of the world. It was like\nslowing down as one comes into a railway station. Everything seemed\nto spin round for a second or two, I had the most transient feeling of\nnausea, and that was all. And the little dog which had seemed to hang\nfor a moment when the force of Gibberne's arm was expended fell with a\nswift acceleration clean through a lady's parasol!\n\nThat was the saving of us. Unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman\nin a bath-chair, who certainly did start at the sight of us and\nafterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye, and,\nfinally, I believe, said something to his nurse about us, I doubt if a\nsolitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them. Plop! We must\nhave appeared abruptly. We ceased to smoulder almost at once, though\nthe turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot. The attention of every\none--including even the Amusements' Association band, which on this\noccasion, for the only time in its history, got out of tune--was\narrested by the amazing fact, and the still more amazing yapping and\nuproar caused by the fact that a respectable, over-fed lap-dog sleeping\nquietly to the east of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the\nparasol of a lady on the west--in a slightly singed condition due to the\nextreme velocity of its movements through the air. In these absurd\ndays, too, when we are all trying to be as psychic, and silly, and\nsuperstitious as possible! People got up and trod on other people,\nchairs were overturned, the Leas policeman ran. How the matter settled\nitself I do not know--we were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves\nfrom the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in\nthe bath-chair to make minute inquiries. As soon as we were sufficiently\ncool and sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and\nconfusion of mind to do so we stood up and, skirting the crowd, directed\nour steps back along the road below the Metropole towards Gibberne's\nhouse. But amidst the din I heard very distinctly the gentleman who\nhad been sitting beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite\nunjustifiable threats and language to one of those chair-attendants who\nhave \"Inspector\" written on their caps. \"If you didn't throw the dog,\"\nhe said, \"who DID?\"\n\nThe sudden return of movement and familiar noises, and our natural\nanxiety about ourselves (our clothe's were still dreadfully hot, and\nthe fronts of the thighs of Gibberne's white trousers were scorched a\ndrabbish brown), prevented the minute observations I should have liked\nto make on all these things. Indeed, I really made no observations of\nany scientific value on that return. The bee, of course, had gone. I\nlooked for that cyclist, but he was already out of sight as we came into\nthe Upper Sandgate Road or hidden from us by traffic; the char-a-banc,\nhowever, with its people now all alive and stirring, was clattering\nalong at a spanking pace almost abreast of the nearer church.\n\nWe noted, however, that the window-sill on which we had stepped in\ngetting out of the house was slightly singed, and that the impressions\nof our feet on the gravel of the path were unusually deep.\n\nSo it was I had my first experience of the New Accelerator. Practically\nwe had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in\nthe space of a second or so of time. We had lived half an hour while the\nband had played, perhaps, two bars. But the effect it had upon us\nwas that the whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection.\nConsidering all things, and particularly considering our rashness in\nventuring out of the house, the experience might certainly have been\nmuch more disagreeable than it was. It showed, no doubt, that Gibberne\nhas still much to learn before his preparation is a manageable\nconvenience, but its practicability it certainly demonstrated beyond all\ncavil.\n\nSince that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under\ncontrol, and I have several times, and without the slightest bad result,\ntaken measured doses under his direction; though I must confess I have\nnot yet ventured abroad again while under its influence. I may mention,\nfor example, that this story has been written at one sitting and without\ninterruption, except for the nibbling of some chocolate, by its means.\nI began at 6.25, and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the\nhalf-hour. The convenience of securing a long, uninterrupted spell of\nwork in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated.\nGibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation,\nwith especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types\nof constitution. He then hopes to find a Retarder with which to dilute\nits present rather excessive potency. The Retarder will, of course, have\nthe reverse effect to the Accelerator; used alone it should enable the\npatient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time,--and\nso to maintain an apathetic inaction, a glacier-like absence of\nalacrity, amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings. The two\nthings together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised\nexistence. It is the beginning of our escape from that Time Garment\nof which Carlyle speaks. While this Accelerator will enable us to\nconcentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion\nthat demands our utmost sense and vigour, the Retarder will enable us\nto pass in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium.\nPerhaps I am a little optimistic about the Retarder, which has indeed\nstill to be discovered, but about the Accelerator there is no possible\nsort of doubt whatever. Its appearance upon the market in a convenient,\ncontrollable, and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months.\nIt will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists, in small green\nbottles, at a high but, considering its extraordinary qualities, by no\nmeans excessive price. Gibberne's Nervous Accelerator it will be called,\nand he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths: one in 200, one\nin 900, and one in 2000, distinguished by yellow, pink, and white labels\nrespectively.\n\nNo doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things\npossible; for, of course, the most remarkable and, possibly, even\ncriminal proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging, as\nit were, into the interstices of time. Like all potent preparations it\nwill be liable to abuse. We have, however, discussed this aspect of\nthe question very thoroughly, and we have decided that this is purely a\nmatter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province.\nWe shall manufacture and sell the Accelerator, and, as for the\nconsequences--we shall see.\n\n\n\n\n9. MR. LEDBETTER'S VACATION\n\nMy friend, Mr. Ledbetter, is a round-faced little man, whose natural\nmildness of eye is gigantically exaggerated when you catch the beam\nthrough his glasses, and whose deep, deliberate voice irritates\nirritable people. A certain elaborate clearness of enunciation has come\nwith him to his present vicarage from his scholastic days, an elaborate\nclearness of enunciation and a certain nervous determination to be firm\nand correct upon all issues, important and unimportant alike. He is a\nsacerdotalist and a chess player, and suspected by many of the secret\npractice of the higher mathematics--creditable rather than interesting\nthings. His conversation is copious and given much to needless detail.\nBy many, indeed, his intercourse is condemned, to put it plainly, as\n\"boring,\" and such have even done me the compliment to wonder why I\ncountenance him. But, on the other hand, there is a large faction\nwho marvel at his countenancing such a dishevelled, discreditable\nacquaintance as myself. Few appear to regard our friendship with\nequanimity. But that is because they do not know of the link that binds\nus, of my amiable connection via Jamaica with Mr. Ledbetter's past.\n\nAbout that past he displays an anxious modesty. \"I do not KNOW what I\nshould do if it became known,\" he says; and repeats, impressively, \"I do\nnot know WHAT I should do.\" As a matter of fact, I doubt if he would do\nanything except get very red about the ears. But that will appear\nlater; nor will I tell here of our first encounter, since, as a general\nrule--though I am prone to break it--the end of a story should come\nafter, rather than before, the beginning. And the beginning of the story\ngoes a long way back; indeed, it is now nearly twenty years since\nFate, by a series of complicated and startling manoeuvres, brought Mr.\nLedbetter, so to speak, into my hands.\n\nIn those days I was living in Jamaica, and Mr. Ledbetter was a\nschoolmaster in England. He was in orders, and already recognisably the\nsame man that he is to-day: the same rotundity of visage, the same or\nsimilar glasses, and the same faint shadow of surprise in his resting\nexpression. He was, of course, dishevelled when I saw him, and his\ncollar less of a collar than a wet bandage, and that may have helped to\nbridge the natural gulf between us--but of that, as I say, later.\n\nThe business began at Hithergate-on-Sea, and simultaneously with Mr.\nLedbetter's summer vacation. Thither he came for a greatly needed rest,\nwith a bright brown portmanteau marked \"F. W. L.\", a new white-and-black\nstraw hat, and two pairs of white flannel trousers. He was naturally\nexhilarated at his release from school--for he was not very fond of the\nboys he taught. After dinner he fell into a discussion with a talkative\nperson established in the boarding-house to which, acting on the advice\nof his aunt, he had resorted. This talkative person was the only\nother man in the house. Their discussion concerned the melancholy\ndisappearance of wonder and adventure in these latter days, the\nprevalence of globe-trotting, the abolition of distance by steam and\nelectricity, the vulgarity of advertisement, the degradation of men\nby civilisation, and many such things. Particularly was the talkative\nperson eloquent on the decay of human courage through security, a\nsecurity Mr. Ledbetter rather thoughtlessly joined him in deploring. Mr.\nLedbetter, in the first delight of emancipation from \"duty,\" and being\nanxious, perhaps, to establish a reputation for manly conviviality,\npartook, rather more freely than was advisable, of the excellent whisky\nthe talkative person produced. But he did not become intoxicated, he\ninsists.\n\nHe was simply eloquent beyond his sober wont, and with the finer edge\ngone from his judgment. And after that long talk of the brave old days\nthat were past forever, he went out into moonlit Hithergate--alone and\nup the cliff road where the villas cluster together.\n\nHe had bewailed, and now as he walked up the silent road he still\nbewailed, the fate that had called him to such an uneventful life as\na pedagogue's. What a prosaic existence he led, so stagnant, so\ncolourless! Secure, methodical, year in year out, what call was there\nfor bravery? He thought enviously of those roving, mediaeval days, so\nnear and so remote, of quests and spies and condottieri and many a risky\nblade-drawing business. And suddenly came a doubt, a strange doubt,\nspringing out of some chance thought of tortures, and destructive\naltogether of the position he had assumed that evening.\n\nWas he--Mr. Ledbetter--really, after all, so brave as he assumed? Would\nhe really be so pleased to have railways, policemen, and security vanish\nsuddenly from the earth?\n\nThe talkative man had spoken enviously of crime. \"The burglar,\" he said,\n\"is the only true adventurer left on earth. Think of his single-handed\nfight against the whole civilised world!\" And Mr. Ledbetter had echoed\nhis envy. \"They DO have some fun out of life,\" Mr. Ledbetter had said.\n\"And about the only people who do. Just think how it must feel to wire\na lawn!\" And he had laughed wickedly. Now, in this franker intimacy of\nself-communion he found himself instituting a comparison between his\nown brand of courage and that of the habitual criminal. He tried to\nmeet these insidious questionings with blank assertion. \"I could do all\nthat,\" said Mr. Ledbetter. \"I long to do all that. Only I do not give\nway to my criminal impulses. My moral courage restrains me.\" But he\ndoubted even while he told himself these things.\n\nMr. Ledbetter passed a large villa standing by itself. Conveniently\nsituated above a quiet, practicable balcony was a window, gaping black,\nwide open. At the time he scarcely marked it, but the picture of it came\nwith him, wove into his thoughts. He figured himself climbing up that\nbalcony, crouching--plunging into that dark, mysterious interior. \"Bah!\nYou would not dare,\" said the Spirit of Doubt. \"My duty to my fellow-men\nforbids,\" said Mr. Ledbetter's self-respect.\n\nIt was nearly eleven, and the little seaside town was already very\nstill. The whole world slumbered under the moonlight. Only one warm\noblong of window-blind far down the road spoke of waking life. He turned\nand came back slowly towards the villa of the open window. He stood for\na time outside the gate, a battlefield of motives. \"Let us put things\nto the test,\" said Doubt. \"For the satisfaction of these intolerable\ndoubts, show that you dare go into that house. Commit a burglary in\nblank. That, at any rate, is no crime.\" Very softly he opened and\nshut the gate and slipped into the shadow of the shrubbery. \"This is\nfoolish,\" said Mr. Ledbetter's caution. \"I expected that,\" said Doubt.\nHis heart was beating fast, but he was certainly not afraid. He was NOT\nafraid. He remained in that shadow for some considerable time.\n\nThe ascent of the balcony, it was evident, would have to be done in a\nrush, for it was all in clear moonlight, and visible from the gate into\nthe avenue. A trellis thinly set with young, ambitious climbing roses\nmade the ascent ridiculously easy. There, in that black shadow by the\nstone vase of flowers, one might crouch and take a closer view of this\ngaping breach in the domestic defences, the open window. For a while\nMr. Ledbetter was as still as the night, and then that insidious whisky\ntipped the balance. He dashed forward. He went up the trellis with\nquick, convulsive movements, swung his legs over the parapet of the\nbalcony, and dropped panting in the shadow even as he had designed. He\nwas trembling violently, short of breath, and his heart pumped noisily,\nbut his mood was exultation. He could have shouted to find he was so\nlittle afraid.\n\nA happy line that he had learnt from Wills's \"Mephistopheles\" came into\nhis mind as he crouched there. \"I feel like a cat on the tiles,\" he\nwhispered to himself. It was far better than he had expected--this\nadventurous exhilaration. He was sorry for all poor men to whom burglary\nwas unknown. Nothing happened. He was quite safe. And he was acting in\nthe bravest manner!\n\nAnd now for the window, to make the burglary complete! Must he dare\ndo that? Its position above the front door defined it as a landing or\npassage, and there were no looking-glasses or any bedroom signs about\nit, or any other window on the first floor, to suggest the possibility\nof a sleeper within. For a time he listened under the ledge, then raised\nhis eyes above the sill and peered in. Close at hand, on a pedestal,\nand a little startling at first, was a nearly life-size gesticulating\nbronze. He ducked, and after some time he peered again. Beyond was a\nbroad landing, faintly gleaming; a flimsy fabric of bead curtain, very\nblack and sharp, against a further window; a broad staircase, plunging\ninto a gulf of darkness below; and another ascending to the second\nfloor. He glanced behind him, but the stillness of the night was\nunbroken. \"Crime,\" he whispered, \"crime,\" and scrambled softly and\nswiftly over the sill into the house. His feet fell noiselessly on a mat\nof skin. He was a burglar indeed!\n\nHe crouched for a time, all ears and peering eyes. Outside was a\nscampering and rustling, and for a moment he repented of his enterprise.\nA short \"miaow,\" a spitting, and a rush into silence, spoke reassuringly\nof cats. His courage grew. He stood up. Every one was abed, it seemed.\nSo easy is it to commit a burglary, if one is so minded. He was glad he\nhad put it to the test. He determined to take some petty trophy, just to\nprove his freedom from any abject fear of the law, and depart the way he\nhad come.\n\nHe peered about him, and suddenly the critical spirit arose again.\nBurglars did far more than such mere elementary entrance as this: they\nwent into rooms, they forced safes. Well--he was not afraid. He could\nnot force safes, because that would be a stupid want of consideration\nfor his hosts. But he would go into rooms--he would go upstairs. More:\nhe told himself that he was perfectly secure; an empty house could not\nbe more reassuringly still. He had to clench his hands, nevertheless,\nand summon all his resolution before he began very softly to ascend the\ndim staircase, pausing for several seconds between each step. Above was\na square landing with one open and several closed doors; and all the\nhouse was still. For a moment he stood wondering what would happen if\nsome sleeper woke suddenly and emerged. The open door showed a moonlit\nbedroom, the coverlet white and undisturbed. Into this room he crept in\nthree interminable minutes and took a piece of soap for his plunder--his\ntrophy. He turned to descend even more softly than he had ascended. It\nwas as easy as--\n\nHist!...\n\nFootsteps! On the gravel outside the house--and then the noise of a\nlatchkey, the yawn and bang of a door, and the spitting of a match in\nthe hall below. Mr. Ledbetter stood petrified by the sudden discovery\nof the folly upon which he had come. \"How on earth am I to get out of\nthis?\" said Mr. Ledbetter.\n\nThe hall grew bright with a candle flame, some heavy object bumped\nagainst the umbrella-stand, and feet were ascending the staircase. In a\nflash Mr. Ledbetter realised that his retreat was closed. He stood for\na moment, a pitiful figure of penitent confusion. \"My goodness! What\na FOOL I have been!\" he whispered, and then darted swiftly across the\nshadowy landing into the empty bedroom from which he had just come.\nHe stood listening--quivering. The footsteps reached the first-floor\nlanding.\n\nHorrible thought! This was possibly the latecomer's room! Not a moment\nwas to be lost! Mr. Ledbetter stooped beside the bed, thanked Heaven for\na valance, and crawled within its protection not ten seconds too soon.\nHe became motionless on hands and knees. The advancing candle-light\nappeared through the thinner stitches of the fabric, the shadows ran\nwildly about, and became rigid as the candle was put down.\n\n\"Lord, what a day!\" said the newcomer, blowing noisily, and it seemed he\ndeposited some heavy burthen on what Mr. Ledbetter, judging by the feet,\ndecided to be a writing-table. The unseen then went to the door and\nlocked it, examined the fastenings of the windows carefully and pulled\ndown the blinds, and returning sat down upon the bed with startling\nponderosity.\n\n\"WHAT a day!\" he said. \"Good Lord!\" and blew again, and Mr. Ledbetter\ninclined to believe that the person was mopping his face. His boots were\ngood stout boots; the shadows of his legs upon the valance suggested\na formidable stoutness of aspect. After a time he removed some upper\ngarments--a coat and waistcoat, Mr. Ledbetter inferred--and casting\nthem over the rail of the bed remained breathing less noisily, and as it\nseemed cooling from a considerable temperature. At intervals he muttered\nto himself, and once he laughed softly. And Mr. Ledbetter muttered to\nhimself, but he did not laugh. \"Of all the foolish things,\" said Mr.\nLedbetter. \"What on earth am I to do now?\"\n\nHis outlook was necessarily limited. The minute apertures between the\nstitches of the fabric of the valance admitted a certain amount of\nlight, but permitted no peeping. The shadows upon this curtain, save\nfor those sharply defined legs, were enigmatical, and intermingled\nconfusingly with the florid patterning of the chintz. Beneath the\nedge of the valance a strip of carpet was visible, and, by cautiously\ndepressing his eye, Mr. Ledbetter found that this strip broadened until\nthe whole area of the floor came into view. The carpet was a luxurious\none, the room spacious, and, to judge by the castors and so forth of the\nfurniture, well equipped.\n\nWhat he should do he found it difficult to imagine. To wait until this\nperson had gone to bed, and then, when he seemed to be sleeping, to\ncreep to the door, unlock it, and bolt headlong for that balcony seemed\nthe only possible thing to do. Would it be possible to jump from the\nbalcony? The danger of it! When he thought of the chances against him,\nMr. Ledbetter despaired. He was within an ace of thrusting forth his\nhead beside the gentleman's legs, coughing if necessary to attract his\nattention, and then, smiling, apologising and explaining his unfortunate\nintrusion by a few well-chosen sentences. But he found these sentences\nhard to choose. \"No doubt, sir, my appearance is peculiar,\" or, \"I\ntrust, sir, you will pardon my somewhat ambiguous appearance from\nbeneath you,\" was about as much as he could get.\n\nGrave possibilities forced themselves on his attention. Suppose they did\nnot believe him, what would they do to him? Would his unblemished\nhigh character count for nothing? Technically he was a burglar, beyond\ndispute. Following out this train of thought, he was composing a lucid\napology for \"this technical crime I have committed,\" to be delivered\nbefore sentence in the dock, when the stout gentleman got up and\nbegan walking about the room. He locked and unlocked drawers, and Mr.\nLedbetter had a transient hope that he might be undressing. But, no! He\nseated himself at the writing-table, and began to write and then tear up\ndocuments. Presently the smell of burning cream-laid paper mingled with\nthe odour of cigars in Mr. Ledbetter's nostrils.\n\n\"The position I had assumed,\" said Mr. Ledbetter when he told me of\nthese things, \"was in many respects an ill-advised one. A transverse bar\nbeneath the bed depressed my head unduly, and threw a disproportionate\nshare of my weight upon my hands. After a time, I experienced what is\ncalled, I believe, a crick in the neck. The pressure of my hands on the\ncoarsely-stitched carpet speedily became painful. My knees, too, were\npainful, my trousers being drawn tightly over them. At that time I wore\nrather higher collars than I do now--two and a half inches, in fact--and\nI discovered what I had not remarked before, that the edge of the one\nI wore was frayed slightly under the chin. But much worse than these\nthings was an itching of my face, which I could only relieve by violent\ngrimacing--I tried to raise my hand, but the rustle of the sleeve\nalarmed me. After a time I had to desist from this relief also,\nbecause--happily in time--I discovered that my facial contortions were\nshifting my glasses down my nose. Their fall would, of course, have\nexposed me, and as it was they came to rest in an oblique position of\nby no means stable equilibrium. In addition I had a slight cold, and an\nintermittent desire to sneeze or sniff caused me inconvenience. In\nfact, quite apart from the extreme anxiety of my position, my physical\ndiscomfort became in a short time very considerable indeed. But I had to\nstay there motionless, nevertheless.\"\n\nAfter an interminable time, there began a chinking sound. This deepened\ninto a rhythm: chink, chink, chink--twenty-five chinks--a rap on the\nwriting-table, and a grunt from the owner of the stout legs. It dawned\nupon Mr. Ledbetter that this chinking was the chinking of gold. He\nbecame incredulously curious as it went on. His curiosity grew. Already,\nif that was the case, this extraordinary man must have counted some\nhundreds of pounds. At last Mr. Ledbetter could resist it no longer,\nand he began very cautiously to fold his arms and lower his head to the\nlevel of the floor, in the hope of peeping under the valance. He moved\nhis feet, and one made a slight scraping on the floor. Suddenly the\nchinking ceased. Mr. Ledbetter became rigid. After a while the chinking\nwas resumed. Then it ceased again, and everything was still, except Mr.\nLedbetter's heart--that organ seemed to him to be beating like a drum.\n\nThe stillness continued. Mr. Ledbetter's head was now on the floor, and\nhe could see the stout legs as far as the shins. They were quite still.\nThe feet were resting on the toes and drawn back, as it seemed, under\nthe chair of the owner. Everything was quite still, everything continued\nstill. A wild hope came to Mr. Ledbetter that the unknown was in a fit\nor suddenly dead, with his head upon the writing-table....\n\nThe stillness continued. What had happened? The desire to peep became\nirresistible. Very cautiously Mr. Ledbetter shifted his hand forward,\nprojected a pioneer finger, and began to lift the valance immediately\nnext his eye. Nothing broke the stillness. He saw now the stranger's\nknees, saw the back of the writing-table, and then--he was staring at\nthe barrel of a heavy revolver pointed over the writing-table at his\nhead.\n\n\"Come out of that, you scoundrel!\" said the voice of the stout gentleman\nin a tone of quiet concentration. \"Come out. This side, and now. None of\nyour hanky-panky--come right out, now.\"\n\nMr. Ledbetter came right out, a little reluctantly perhaps, but without\nany hanky-panky, and at once, even as he was told.\n\n\"Kneel,\" said the stout gentleman, \"and hold up your hands.\"\n\nThe valance dropped again behind Mr. Ledbetter, and he rose from\nall-fours and held up his hands. \"Dressed like a parson,\" said the stout\ngentleman. \"I'm blest if he isn't! A little chap, too! You SCOUNDREL!\nWhat the deuce possessed you to come here to-night? What the deuce\npossessed you to get under my bed?\"\n\nHe did not appear to require an answer, but proceeded at once to several\nvery objectionable remarks upon Mr. Ledbetter's personal appearance. He\nwas not a very big man, but he looked strong to Mr. Ledbetter: he was as\nstout as his legs had promised, he had rather delicately-chiselled small\nfeatures distributed over a considerable area of whitish face, and quite\na number of chins. And the note of his voice had a sort of whispering\nundertone.\n\n\"What the deuce, I say, possessed you to get under my bed?\"\n\nMr. Ledbetter, by an effort, smiled a wan propitiatory smile. He\ncoughed. \"I can quite understand--\" he said.\n\n\"Why! What on earth? It's SOAP! No!--you scoundrel. Don't you move that\nhand.\"\n\n\"It's soap,\" said Mr. Ledbetter. \"From your washstand. No doubt it--\"\n\n\"Don't talk,\" said the stout man. \"I see it's soap. Of all incredible\nthings.\"\n\n\"If I might explain--\"\n\n\"Don't explain. It's sure to be a lie, and there's no time for\nexplanations. What was I going to ask you? Ah! Have you any mates?\"\n\n\"In a few minutes, if you--\"\n\n\"Have you any mates? Curse you. If you start any soapy palaver I'll\nshoot. Have you any mates?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Ledbetter.\n\n\"I suppose it's a lie,\" said the stout man. \"But you'll pay for it if\nit is. Why the deuce didn't you floor me when I came upstairs? You won't\nget a chance to now, anyhow. Fancy getting under the bed! I reckon it's\na fair cop, anyhow, so far as you are concerned.\"\n\n\"I don't see how I could prove an alibi,\" remarked Mr. Ledbetter, trying\nto show by his conversation that he was an educated man. There was a\npause. Mr. Ledbetter perceived that on a chair beside his captor was a\nlarge black bag on a heap of crumpled papers, and that there were torn\nand burnt papers on the table. And in front of these, and arranged\nmethodically along the edge were rows and rows of little yellow\nrouleaux--a hundred times more gold than Mr. Ledbetter had seen in all\nhis life before. The light of two candles, in silver candlesticks, fell\nupon these. The pause continued. \"It is rather fatiguing holding up my\nhands like this,\" said Mr. Ledbetter, with a deprecatory smile.\n\n\"That's all right,\" said the fat man. \"But what to do with you I don't\nexactly know.\"\n\n\"I know my position is ambiguous.\"\n\n\"Lord!\" said the fat man, \"ambiguous! And goes about with his own\nsoap, and wears a thundering great clerical collar. You ARE a blooming\nburglar, you are--if ever there was one!\"\n\n\"To be strictly accurate,\" said Mr. Ledbetter, and suddenly his glasses\nslipped off and clattered against his vest buttons.\n\nThe fat man changed countenance, a flash of savage resolution crossed\nhis face, and something in the revolver clicked. He put his other hand\nto the weapon. And then he looked at Mr. Ledbetter, and his eye went\ndown to the dropped pince-nez.\n\n\"Full-cock now, anyhow,\" said the fat man, after a pause, and his breath\nseemed to catch. \"But I'll tell you, you've never been so near death\nbefore. Lord! I'M almost glad. If it hadn't been that the revolver\nwasn't cocked you'd be lying dead there now.\"\n\nMr. Ledbetter said nothing, but he felt that the room was swaying.\n\n\"A miss is as good as a mile. It's lucky for both of us it wasn't.\nLord!\" He blew noisily. \"There's no need for you to go pale-green for a\nlittle thing like that.\"\n\n\"If I can assure you, sir--\" said Mr. Ledbetter, with an effort.\n\n\"There's only one thing to do. If I call in the police, I'm bust--a\nlittle game I've got on is bust. That won't do. If I tie you up and\nleave you again, the thing may be out to-morrow. Tomorrow's Sunday, and\nMonday's Bank Holiday--I've counted on three clear days. Shooting\nyou's murder--and hanging; and besides, it will bust the whole blooming\nkernooze. I'm hanged if I can think what to do--I'm hanged if I can.\"\n\n\"Will you permit me--\"\n\n\"You gas as much as if you were a real parson, I'm blessed if you don't.\nOf all the burglars you are the--Well! No!--I WON'T permit you. There\nisn't time. If you start off jawing again, I'll shoot right in your\nstomach. See? But I know now-I know now! What we're going to do first,\nmy man, is an examination for concealed arms--an examination for\nconcealed arms. And look here! When I tell you to do a thing, don't\nstart off at a gabble--do it brisk.\"\n\nAnd with many elaborate precautions, and always pointing the pistol at\nMr. Ledbetter's head, the stout man stood him up and searched him for\nweapons. \"Why, you ARE a burglar!\" he said \"You're a perfect amateur.\nYou haven't even a pistol-pocket in the back of your breeches. No, you\ndon't! Shut up, now.\"\n\nSo soon as the issue was decided, the stout man made Mr. Ledbetter take\noff his coat and roll up his shirt-sleeves, and, with the revolver at\none ear, proceed with the packing his appearance had interrupted. From\nthe stout man's point of view that was evidently the only possible\narrangement, for if he had packed, he would have had to put down\nthe revolver. So that even the gold on the table was handled by Mr.\nLedbetter. This nocturnal packing was peculiar. The stout man's idea was\nevidently to distribute the weight of the gold as unostentatiously\nas possible through his luggage. It was by no means an inconsiderable\nweight. There was, Mr. Ledbetter says, altogether nearly L18,000 in gold\nin the black bag and on the table. There were also many little rolls\nof L5 bank-notes. Each rouleau of L25 was wrapped by Mr. Ledbetter\nin paper. These rouleaux were then put neatly in cigar boxes and\ndistributed between a travelling trunk, a Gladstone bag, and a hatbox.\nAbout L600 went in a tobacco tin in a dressing-bag. L10 in gold and a\nnumber of L5 notes the stout man pocketed. Occasionally he objurgated\nMr. Ledbetter's clumsiness, and urged him to hurry, and several times he\nappealed to Mr. Ledbetter's watch for information.\n\nMr. Ledbetter strapped the trunk and bag, and returned the stout man\nthe keys. It was then ten minutes to twelve, and until the stroke of\nmidnight the stout man made him sit on the Gladstone bag, while he sat\nat a reasonably safe distance on the trunk and held the revolver handy\nand waited. He appeared to be now in a less aggressive mood, and having\nwatched Mr. Ledbetter for some time, he offered a few remarks.\n\n\"From your accent I judge you are a man of some education,\" he said,\nlighting a cigar. \"No--DON'T begin that explanation of yours. I know it\nwill be long-winded from your face, and I am much too old a liar to be\ninterested in other men's lying. You are, I say, a person of education.\nYou do well to dress as a curate. Even among educated people you might\npass as a curate.\"\n\n\"I AM a curate,\" said Mr. Ledbetter, \"or, at least--\"\n\n\"You are trying to be. I know. But you didn't ought to burgle. You are\nnot the man to burgle. You are, if I may say it--the thing will have\nbeen pointed out to you before--a coward.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Mr. Ledbetter, trying to get a final opening, \"it\nwas that very question--\"\n\nThe stout man waved him into silence.\n\n\"You waste your education in burglary. You should do one of two things.\nEither you should forge or you should embezzle. For my own part, I\nembezzle. Yes; I embezzle. What do you think a man could be doing with\nall this gold but that? Ah! Listen! Midnight!... Ten. Eleven. Twelve.\nThere is something very impressive to me in that slow beating of the\nhours. Time--space; what mysteries they are! What mysteries.... It's\ntime for us to be moving. Stand up!\"\n\nAnd then kindly, but firmly, he induced Mr. Ledbetter to sling the\ndressing bag over his back by a string across his chest, to shoulder the\ntrunk, and, overruling a gasping protest, to take the Gladstone bag in\nhis disengaged hand. So encumbered, Mr. Ledbetter struggled perilously\ndownstairs. The stout gentleman followed with an overcoat, the hatbox,\nand the revolver, making derogatory remarks about Mr. Ledbetter's\nstrength, and assisting him at the turnings of the stairs.\n\n\"The back door,\" he directed, and Mr. Ledbetter staggered through a\nconservatory, leaving a wake of smashed flower-pots behind him. \"Never\nmind the crockery,\" said the stout man; \"it's good for trade. We wait\nhere until a quarter past. You can put those things down. You have!\"\n\nMr. Ledbetter collapsed panting on the trunk. \"Last night,\" he gasped,\n\"I was asleep in my little room, and I no more dreamt--\"\n\n\"There's no need for you to incriminate yourself,\" said the stout\ngentleman, looking at the lock of the revolver. He began to hum. Mr.\nLedbetter made to speak, and thought better of it.\n\nThere presently came the sound of a bell, and Mr. Ledbetter was taken to\nthe back door and instructed to open it. A fair-haired man in yachting\ncostume entered. At the sight of Mr. Ledbetter he started violently and\nclapped his hand behind him. Then he saw the stout man. \"Bingham!\" he\ncried, \"who's this?\"\n\n\"Only a little philanthropic do of mine--burglar I'm trying to reform.\nCaught him under my bed just now. He's all right. He's a frightful ass.\nHe'll be useful to carry some of our things.\"\n\nThe newcomer seemed inclined to resent Mr. Ledbetter's presence at\nfirst, but the stout man reassured him.\n\n\"He's quite alone. There's not a gang in the world would own him.\nNo!--don't start talking, for goodness' sake.\"\n\nThey went out into the darkness of the garden with the trunk still\nbowing Mr. Ledbetter's shoulders. The man in the yachting costume walked\nin front with the Gladstone bag and a pistol; then came Mr. Ledbetter\nlike Atlas; Mr. Bingham followed with the hat-box, coat, and revolver as\nbefore. The house was one of those that have their gardens right up to\nthe cliff. At the cliff was a steep wooden stairway, descending to a\nbathing tent dimly visible on the beach. Below was a boat pulled up, and\na silent little man with a black face stood beside it. \"A few moments'\nexplanation,\" said Mr. Ledbetter; \"I can assure you--\" Somebody kicked\nhim, and he said no more.\n\nThey made him wade to the boat, carrying the trunk, they pulled him\naboard by the shoulders and hair, they called him no better name than\n\"scoundrel\" and \"burglar\" all that night. But they spoke in undertones\nso that the general public was happily unaware of his ignominy. They\nhauled him aboard a yacht manned by strange, unsympathetic Orientals,\nand partly they thrust him and partly he fell down a gangway into a\nnoisome, dark place, where he was to remain many days--how many he does\nnot know, because he lost count among other things when he was seasick.\nThey fed him on biscuits and incomprehensible words; they gave him water\nto drink mixed with unwished-for rum. And there were cockroaches\nwhere they put him, night and day there were cockroaches, and in the\nnight-time there were rats. The Orientals emptied his pockets and took\nhis watch--but Mr. Bingham, being appealed to, took that himself.\nAnd five or six times the five Lascars--if they were Lascars--and the\nChinaman and the negro who constituted the crew, fished him out and\ntook him aft to Bingham and his friend to play cribbage and euchre and\nthree-anded whist, and to listen to their stories and boastings in an\ninterested manner.\n\nThen these principals would talk to him as men talk to those who have\nlived a life of crime. Explanations they would never permit, though they\nmade it abundantly clear to him that he was the rummiest burglar they\nhad ever set eyes on. They said as much again and again. The fair man\nwas of a taciturn disposition and irascible at play; but Mr. Bingham,\nnow that the evident anxiety of his departure from England was assuaged,\ndisplayed a vein of genial philosophy. He enlarged upon the mystery of\nspace and time, and quoted Kant and Hegel--or, at least, he said he did.\nSeveral times Mr. Ledbetter got as far as: \"My position under your bed,\nyou know--,\" but then he always had to cut, or pass the whisky, or do\nsome such intervening thing. After his third failure, the fair man got\nquite to look for this opening, and whenever Mr. Ledbetter began after\nthat, he would roar with laughter and hit him violently on the back.\n\"Same old start, same old story; good old burglar!\" the fair-haired man\nwould say.\n\nSo Mr. Ledbetter suffered for many days, twenty perhaps; and one evening\nhe was taken, together with some tinned provisions, over the side and\nput ashore on a rocky little island with a spring. Mr. Bingham came in\nthe boat with him, giving him good advice all the way, and waving his\nlast attempts at an explanation aside.\n\n\"I am really NOT a burglar,\" said Mr. Ledbetter.\n\n\"You never will be,\" said Mr. Bingham. \"You'll never make a burglar. I'm\nglad you are beginning to see it. In choosing a profession a man must\nstudy his temperament. If you don't, sooner or later you will fail.\nCompare myself, for example. All my life I have been in banks--I have\ngot on in banks. I have even been a bank manager. But was I happy? No.\nWhy wasn't I happy? Because it did not suit my temperament. I am too\nadventurous--too versatile. Practically I have thrown it over. I do not\nsuppose I shall ever manage a bank again. They would be glad to get me,\nno doubt; but I have learnt the lesson of my temperament--at last....\nNo! I shall never manage a bank again.\n\n\"Now, your temperament unfits you for crime--just as mine unfits me\nfor respectability. I know you better than I did, and now I do not even\nrecommend forgery. Go back to respectable courses, my man. YOUR lay\nis the philanthropic lay--that is your lay. With that voice--the\nAssociation for the Promotion of Snivelling among the Young--something\nin that line. You think it over.\n\n\"The island we are approaching has no name apparently--at least, there\nis none on the chart. You might think out a name for it while you are\nthere--while you are thinking about all these things. It has quite\ndrinkable water, I understand. It is one of the Grenadines--one of the\nWindward Islands. Yonder, dim and blue, are others of the Grenadines.\nThere are quantities of Grenadines, but the majority are out of sight.\nI have often wondered what these islands are for--now, you see, I am\nwiser. This one at least is for you. Sooner or later some simple native\nwill come along and take you off. Say what you like about us then--abuse\nus, if you like--we shan't care a solitary Grenadine! And here--here\nis half a sovereign's worth of silver. Do not waste that in foolish\ndissipation when you return to civilisation. Properly used, it may give\nyou a fresh start in life. And do not--Don't beach her, you beggars,\nhe can wade!--Do not waste the precious solitude before you in foolish\nthoughts. Properly used, it may be a turning-point in your career. Waste\nneither money nor time. You will die rich. I'm sorry, but I must ask you\nto carry your tucker to land in your arms. No; it's not deep. Curse\nthat explanation of yours! There's not time. No, no, no! I won't listen.\nOverboard you go!\"\n\nAnd the falling night found Mr. Ledbetter--the Mr. Ledbetter who had\ncomplained that adventure was dead--sitting beside his cans of food,\nhis chin resting upon his drawn-up knees, staring through his glasses in\ndismal mildness over the shining, vacant sea.\n\nHe was picked up in the course of three days by a negro fisherman\nand taken to St. Vincent's, and from St. Vincent's he got, by the\nexpenditure of his last coins, to Kingston, in Jamaica. And there he\nmight have foundered. Even nowadays he is not a man of affairs, and then\nhe was a singularly helpless person. He had not the remotest idea what\nhe ought to do. The only thing he seems to have done was to visit all\nthe ministers of religion he could find in the place to borrow a passage\nhome. But he was much too dirty and incoherent--and his story far\ntoo incredible for them. I met him quite by chance. It was close upon\nsunset, and I was walking out after my siesta on the road to Dunn's\nBattery, when I met him--I was rather bored, and with a whole evening\non my hands--luckily for him. He was trudging dismally towards the\ntown. His woebegone face and the quasi-clerical cut of his dust-stained,\nfilthy costume caught my humour. Our eyes met. He hesitated. \"Sir,\" he\nsaid, with a catching of the breath, \"could you spare a few minutes for\nwhat I fear will seem an incredible story?\"\n\n\"Incredible!\" I said.\n\n\"Quite,\" he answered eagerly. \"No one will believe it, alter it though I\nmay. Yet I can assure you, sir--\"\n\nHe stopped hopelessly. The man's tone tickled me. He seemed an odd\ncharacter. \"I am,\" he said, \"one of the most unfortunate beings alive.\"\n\n\"Among other things, you haven't dined?\" I said, struck with an idea.\n\n\"I have not,\" he said solemnly, \"for many days.\"\n\n\"You'll tell it better after that,\" I said; and without more ado led the\nway to a low place I knew, where such a costume as his was unlikely to\ngive offence. And there--with certain omissions which he subsequently\nsupplied--I got his story. At first I was incredulous, but as the wine\nwarmed him, and the faint suggestion of cringing which his misfortunes\nhad added to his manner disappeared, I began to believe. At last, I was\nso far convinced of his sincerity that I got him a bed for the night,\nand next day verified the banker's reference he gave me through my\nJamaica banker. And that done, I took him shopping for underwear\nand such like equipments of a gentleman at large. Presently came the\nverified reference. His astonishing story was true. I will not amplify\nour subsequent proceedings. He started for England in three days' time.\n\n\"I do not know how I can possibly thank you enough,\" began the letter he\nwrote me from England, \"for all your kindness to a total stranger,\" and\nproceeded for some time in a similar strain. \"Had it not been for your\ngenerous assistance, I could certainly never have returned in time for\nthe resumption of my scholastic duties, and my few minutes of reckless\nfolly would, perhaps, have proved my ruin. As it is, I am entangled in\na tissue of lies and evasions, of the most complicated sort, to account\nfor my sunburnt appearance and my whereabouts. I have rather carelessly\ntold two or three different stories, not realising the trouble this\nwould mean for me in the end. The truth I dare not tell. I have\nconsulted a number of law-books in the British Museum, and there is\nnot the slightest doubt that I have connived at and abetted and aided a\nfelony. That scoundrel Bingham was the Hithergate bank manager, I find,\nand guilty of the most flagrant embezzlement. Please, please burn this\nletter when read--I trust you implicitly. The worst of it is, neither my\naunt nor her friend who kept the boarding-house at which I was staying\nseem altogether to believe a guarded statement I have made them\npractically of what actually happened. They suspect me of some\ndiscreditable adventure, but what sort of discreditable adventure they\nsuspect me of, I do not know. My aunt says she would forgive me if I\ntold her everything. I have--I have told her MORE than everything, and\nstill she is not satisfied. It would never do to let them know the truth\nof the case, of course, and so I represent myself as having been waylaid\nand gagged upon the beach. My aunt wants to know WHY they waylaid and\ngagged me, why they took me away in their yacht. I do not know. Can\nyou suggest any reason? I can think of nothing. If, when you wrote, you\ncould write on TWO sheets so that I could show her one, and on that one\nif you could show clearly that I really WAS in Jamaica this summer,\nand had come there by being removed from a ship, it would be of great\nservice to me. It would certainly add to the load of my obligation\nto you--a load that I fear I can never fully repay. Although if\ngratitude...\" And so forth. At the end he repeated his request for me to\nburn the letter.\n\nSo the remarkable story of Mr. Ledbetter's Vacation ends. That breach\nwith his aunt was not of long duration. The old lady had forgiven him\nbefore she died.\n\n\n\n\n10. THE STOLEN BODY\n\nMr. Bessel was the senior partner in the firm of Bessel, Hart, and\nBrown, of St. Paul's Churchyard, and for many years he was well known\namong those interested in psychical research as a liberal-minded and\nconscientious investigator. He was an unmarried man, and instead of\nliving in the suburbs, after the fashion of his class, he occupied rooms\nin the Albany, near Piccadilly. He was particularly interested in the\nquestions of thought transference and of apparitions of the living, and\nin November, 1896, he commenced a series of experiments in conjunction\nwith Mr. Vincey, of Staple Inn, in order to test the alleged possibility\nof projecting an apparition of one's self by force of will through\nspace.\n\nTheir experiments were conducted in the following manner: At a\npre-arranged hour Mr. Bessel shut himself in one of his rooms in the\nAlbany and Mr. Vincey in his sitting-room in Staple Inn, and each then\nfixed his mind as resolutely as possible on the other. Mr. Bessel\nhad acquired the art of self-hypnotism, and, so far as he could, he\nattempted first to hypnotise himself and then to project himself as a\n\"phantom of the living\" across the intervening space of nearly two miles\ninto Mr. Vincey's apartment. On several evenings this was tried without\nany satisfactory result, but on the fifth or sixth occasion Mr. Vincey\ndid actually see or imagine he saw an apparition of Mr. Bessel standing\nin his room. He states that the appearance, although brief, was very\nvivid and real. He noticed that Mr. Bessel's face was white and his\nexpression anxious, and, moreover, that his hair was disordered. For\na moment Mr. Vincey, in spite of his state of expectation, was too\nsurprised to speak or move, and in that moment it seemed to him as\nthough the figure glanced over its shoulder and incontinently vanished.\n\nIt had been arranged that an attempt should be made to photograph any\nphantasm seen, but Mr. Vincey had not the instant presence of mind to\nsnap the camera that lay ready on the table beside him, and when he\ndid so he was too late. Greatly elated, however, even by this partial\nsuccess, he made a note of the exact time, and at once took a cab to the\nAlbany to inform Mr. Bessel of this result.\n\nHe was surprised to find Mr. Bessel's outer door standing open to the\nnight, and the inner apartments lit and in an extraordinary disorder.\nAn empty champagne magnum lay smashed upon the floor; its neck had\nbeen broken off against the inkpot on the bureau and lay beside it.\nAn octagonal occasional table, which carried a bronze statuette and\na number of choice books, had been rudely overturned, and down the\nprimrose paper of the wall inky fingers had been drawn, as it seemed for\nthe mere pleasure of defilement. One of the delicate chintz curtains had\nbeen violently torn from its rings and thrust upon the fire, so that\nthe smell of its smouldering filled the room. Indeed the whole place was\ndisarranged in the strangest fashion. For a few minutes Mr. Vincey, who\nhad entered sure of finding Mr. Bessel in his easy chair awaiting him,\ncould scarcely believe his eyes, and stood staring helplessly at these\nunanticipated things.\n\nThen, full of a vague sense of calamity, he sought the porter at the\nentrance lodge. \"Where is Mr. Bessel?\" he asked. \"Do you know that all\nthe furniture is broken in Mr. Bessel's room?\" The porter said nothing,\nbut, obeying his gestures, came at once to Mr. Bessel's apartment to see\nthe state of affairs. \"This settles it,\" he said, surveying the lunatic\nconfusion. \"I didn't know of this. Mr. Bessel's gone off. He's mad!\"\n\nHe then proceeded to tell Mr. Vincey that about half an hour previously,\nthat is to say, at about the time of Mr. Bessel's apparition in Mr.\nVincey's rooms, the missing gentleman had rushed out of the gates of\nthe Albany into Vigo Street, hatless and with disordered hair, and had\nvanished into the direction of Bond Street. \"And as he went past me,\"\nsaid the porter, \"he laughed--a sort of gasping laugh, with his mouth\nopen and his eyes glaring--I tell you, sir, he fair scared me!--like\nthis.\"\n\nAccording to his imitation it was anything but a pleasant laugh. \"He\nwaved his hand, with all his fingers crooked and clawing--like that.\nAnd he said, in a sort of fierce whisper, 'LIFE!' Just that one word,\n'LIFE!'\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Mr. Vincey. \"Tut, tut,\" and \"Dear me!\" He could think\nof nothing else to say. He was naturally very much surprised. He turned\nfrom the room to the porter and from the porter to the room in the\ngravest perplexity. Beyond his suggestion that probably Mr. Bessel would\ncome back presently and explain what had happened, their conversation\nwas unable to proceed. \"It might be a sudden toothache,\" said\nthe porter, \"a very sudden and violent toothache, jumping on him\nsuddenly-like and driving him wild. I've broken things myself before now\nin such a case...\" He thought. \"If it was, why should he say 'LIFE' to\nme as he went past?\"\n\nMr. Vincey did not know. Mr. Bessel did not return, and at last Mr.\nVincey, having done some more helpless staring, and having addressed\na note of brief inquiry and left it in a conspicuous position on the\nbureau, returned in a very perplexed frame of mind to his own premises\nin Staple Inn. This affair had given him a shock. He was at a loss to\naccount for Mr. Bessel's conduct on any sane hypothesis. He tried to\nread, but he could not do so; he went for a short walk, and was so\npreoccupied that he narrowly escaped a cab at the top of Chancery Lane;\nand at last--a full hour before his usual time--he went to bed. For a\nconsiderable time he could not sleep because of his memory of the silent\nconfusion of Mr. Bessel's apartment, and when at length he did attain an\nuneasy slumber it was at once disturbed by a very vivid and distressing\ndream of Mr. Bessel.\n\nHe saw Mr. Bessel gesticulating wildly, and with his face white and\ncontorted. And, inexplicably mingled with his appearance, suggested\nperhaps by his gestures, was an intense fear, an urgency to act. He\neven believes that he heard the voice of his fellow experimenter calling\ndistressfully to him, though at the time he considered this to be an\nillusion. The vivid impression remained though Mr. Vincey awoke. For a\nspace he lay awake and trembling in the darkness, possessed with that\nvague, unaccountable terror of unknown possibilities that comes out of\ndreams upon even the bravest men. But at last he roused himself, and\nturned over and went to sleep again, only for the dream to return with\nenhanced vividness.\n\nHe awoke with such a strong conviction that Mr. Bessel was in\noverwhelming distress and need of help that sleep was no longer\npossible. He was persuaded that his friend had rushed out to some dire\ncalamity. For a time he lay reasoning vainly against this belief, but at\nlast he gave way to it. He arose, against all reason, lit his gas, and\ndressed, and set out through the deserted streets--deserted, save for a\nnoiseless policeman or so and the early news carts--towards Vigo Street\nto inquire if Mr. Bessel had returned.\n\nBut he never got there. As he was going down Long Acre some\nunaccountable impulse turned him aside out of that street towards Covent\nGarden, which was just waking to its nocturnal activities. He saw the\nmarket in front of him--a queer effect of glowing yellow lights and busy\nblack figures. He became aware of a shouting, and perceived a figure\nturn the corner by the hotel and run swiftly towards him. He knew at\nonce that it was Mr. Bessel. But it was Mr. Bessel transfigured. He\nwas hatless and dishevelled, his collar was torn open, he grasped a\nbone-handled walking-cane near the ferrule end, and his mouth was pulled\nawry. And he ran, with agile strides, very rapidly. Their encounter was\nthe affair of an instant. \"Bessel!\" cried Vincey.\n\nThe running man gave no sign of recognition either of Mr. Vincey or of\nhis own name. Instead, he cut at his friend savagely with the stick,\nhitting him in the face within an inch of the eye. Mr. Vincey, stunned\nand astonished, staggered back, lost his footing, and fell heavily on\nthe pavement. It seemed to him that Mr. Bessel leapt over him as he\nfell. When he looked again Mr. Bessel had vanished, and a policeman and\na number of garden porters and salesmen were rushing past towards Long\nAcre in hot pursuit.\n\nWith the assistance of several passers-by--for the whole street was\nspeedily alive with running people--Mr. Vincey struggled to his feet.\nHe at once became the centre of a crowd greedy to see his injury. A\nmultitude of voices competed to reassure him of his safety, and then to\ntell him of the behaviour of the madman, as they regarded Mr. Bessel.\nHe had suddenly appeared in the middle of the market screaming \"LIFE!\nLIFE!\" striking left and right with a blood-stained walking-stick, and\ndancing and shouting with laughter at each successful blow. A lad and\ntwo women had broken heads, and he had smashed a man's wrist; a little\nchild had been knocked insensible, and for a time he had driven every\none before him, so furious and resolute had his behaviour been. Then he\nmade a raid upon a coffee stall, hurled its paraffin flare through\nthe window of the post office, and fled laughing, after stunning the\nforemost of the two policemen who had the pluck to charge him.\n\nMr. Vincey's first impulse was naturally to join in the pursuit of\nhis friend, in order if possible to save him from the violence of the\nindignant people. But his action was slow, the blow had half stunned\nhim, and while this was still no more than a resolution came the news,\nshouted through the crowd, that Mr. Bessel had eluded his pursuers. At\nfirst Mr. Vincey could scarcely credit this, but the universality of\nthe report, and presently the dignified return of two futile policemen,\nconvinced him. After some aimless inquiries he returned towards Staple\nInn, padding a handkerchief to a now very painful nose.\n\nHe was angry and astonished and perplexed. It appeared to him\nindisputable that Mr. Bessel must have gone violently mad in the midst\nof his experiment in thought transference, but why that should make him\nappear with a sad white face in Mr. Vincey's dreams seemed a problem\nbeyond solution. He racked his brains in vain to explain this. It seemed\nto him at last that not simply Mr. Bessel, but the order of things\nmust be insane. But he could think of nothing to do. He shut himself\ncarefully into his room, lit his fire--it was a gas fire with asbestos\nbricks--and, fearing fresh dreams if he went to bed, remained bathing\nhis injured face, or holding up books in a vain attempt to read, until\ndawn. Throughout that vigil he had a curious persuasion that Mr. Bessel\nwas endeavouring to speak to him, but he would not let himself attend to\nany such belief.\n\nAbout dawn, his physical fatigue asserted itself, and he went to bed and\nslept at last in spite of dreaming. He rose late, unrested and anxious,\nand in considerable facial pain. The morning papers had no news of\nMr. Bessel's aberration--it had come too late for them. Mr. Vincey's\nperplexities, to which the fever of his bruise added fresh irritation,\nbecame at last intolerable, and, after a fruitless visit to the Albany,\nhe went down to St. Paul's Churchyard to Mr. Hart, Mr. Bessel's partner,\nand, so far as Mr. Vincey knew, his nearest friend.\n\nHe was surprised to learn that Mr. Hart, although he knew nothing of the\noutbreak, had also been disturbed by a vision, the very vision that Mr.\nVincey had seen--Mr. Bessel, white and dishevelled, pleading earnestly\nby his gestures for help. That was his impression of the import of his\nsigns. \"I was just going to look him up in the Albany when you arrived,\"\nsaid Mr. Hart. \"I was so sure of something being wrong with him.\"\n\nAs the outcome of their consultation the two gentlemen decided to\ninquire at Scotland Yard for news of their missing friend. \"He is bound\nto be laid by the heels,\" said Mr. Hart. \"He can't go on at that pace\nfor long.\" But the police authorities had not laid Mr. Bessel by the\nheels. They confirmed Mr. Vincey's overnight experiences and added fresh\ncircumstances, some of an even graver character than those he knew--a\nlist of smashed glass along the upper half of Tottenham Court Road, an\nattack upon a policeman in Hampstead Road, and an atrocious assault upon\na woman. All these outrages were committed between half-past twelve and\na quarter to two in the morning, and between those hours--and, indeed,\nfrom the very moment of Mr. Bessel's first rush from his rooms at\nhalf-past nine in the evening--they could trace the deepening violence\nof his fantastic career. For the last hour, at least from before one,\nthat is, until a quarter to two, he had run amuck through London,\neluding with amazing agility every effort to stop or capture him.\n\nBut after a quarter to two he had vanished. Up to that hour witnesses\nwere multitudinous. Dozens of people had seen him, fled from him or\npursued him, and then things suddenly came to an end. At a quarter to\ntwo he had been seen running down the Euston Road towards Baker Street,\nflourishing a can of burning colza oil and jerking splashes of flame\ntherefrom at the windows of the houses he passed. But none of the\npolicemen on Euston Road beyond the Waxwork Exhibition, nor any of\nthose in the side streets down which he must have passed had he left the\nEuston Road, had seen anything of him. Abruptly he disappeared. Nothing\nof his subsequent doings came to light in spite of the keenest inquiry.\n\nHere was a fresh astonishment for Mr. Vincey. He had found considerable\ncomfort in Mr. Hart's conviction: \"He is bound to be laid by the heels\nbefore long,\" and in that assurance he had been able to suspend his\nmental perplexities. But any fresh development seemed destined to add\nnew impossibilities to a pile already heaped beyond the powers of his\nacceptance. He found himself doubting whether his memory might not have\nplayed him some grotesque trick, debating whether any of these things\ncould possibly have happened; and in the afternoon he hunted up Mr. Hart\nagain to share the intolerable weight on his mind. He found Mr. Hart\nengaged with a well-known private detective, but as that gentleman\naccomplished nothing in this case, we need not enlarge upon his\nproceedings.\n\nAll that day Mr. Bessel's whereabouts eluded an unceasingly active\ninquiry, and all that night. And all that day there was a persuasion in\nthe back of Vincey's mind that Mr. Bessel sought his attention, and all\nthrough the night Mr. Bessel with a tear-stained face of anguish pursued\nhim through his dreams. And whenever he saw Mr. Bessel in his dreams he\nalso saw a number of other faces, vague but malignant, that seemed to be\npursuing Mr. Bessel.\n\nIt was on the following day, Sunday, that Mr. Vincey recalled certain\nremarkable stories of Mrs. Bullock, the medium, who was then attracting\nattention for the first time in London. He determined to consult her.\nShe was staying at the house of that well-known inquirer, Dr. Wilson\nPaget, and Mr. Vincey, although he had never met that gentleman before,\nrepaired to him forthwith with the intention of invoking her help.\nBut scarcely had he mentioned the name of Bessel when Doctor Paget\ninterrupted him. \"Last night--just at the end,\" he said, \"we had a\ncommunication.\"\n\nHe left the room, and returned with a slate on which were certain words\nwritten in a handwriting, shaky indeed, but indisputably the handwriting\nof Mr. Bessel!\n\n\"How did you get this?\" said Mr. Vincey. \"Do you mean--?\"\n\n\"We got it last night,\" said Doctor Paget. With numerous interruptions\nfrom Mr. Vincey, he proceeded to explain how the writing had been\nobtained. It appears that in her seances, Mrs. Bullock passes into a\ncondition of trance, her eyes rolling up in a strange way under her\neyelids, and her body becoming rigid. She then begins to talk very\nrapidly, usually in voices other than her own. At the same time one\nor both of her hands may become active, and if slates and pencils are\nprovided they will then write messages simultaneously with and quite\nindependently of the flow of words from her mouth. By many she is\nconsidered an even more remarkable medium than the celebrated Mrs.\nPiper. It was one of these messages, the one written by her left hand,\nthat Mr. Vincey now had before him. It consisted of eight words written\ndisconnectedly: \"George Bessel... trial excavn.... Baker Street...\nhelp... starvation.\" Curiously enough, neither Doctor Paget nor the two\nother inquirers who were present had heard of the disappearance of\nMr. Bessel--the news of it appeared only in the evening papers of\nSaturday--and they had put the message aside with many others of a vague\nand enigmatical sort that Mrs. Bullock has from time to time delivered.\n\nWhen Doctor Paget heard Mr. Vincey's story, he gave himself at once with\ngreat energy to the pursuit of this clue to the discovery of Mr. Bessel.\nIt would serve no useful purpose here to describe the inquiries of Mr.\nVincey and himself; suffice it that the clue was a genuine one, and that\nMr. Bessel was actually discovered by its aid.\n\nHe was found at the bottom of a detached shaft which had been sunk and\nabandoned at the commencement of the work for the new electric railway\nnear Baker Street Station. His arm and leg and two ribs were broken.\nThe shaft is protected by a hoarding nearly 20 feet high, and over this,\nincredible as it seems, Mr. Bessel, a stout, middle-aged gentleman,\nmust have scrambled in order to fall down the shaft. He was saturated in\ncolza oil, and the smashed tin lay beside him, but luckily the flame\nhad been extinguished by his fall. And his madness had passed from him\naltogether. But he was, of course, terribly enfeebled, and at the sight\nof his rescuers he gave way to hysterical weeping.\n\nIn view of the deplorable state of his flat, he was taken to the house\nof Dr. Hatton in Upper Baker Street. Here he was subjected to a sedative\ntreatment, and anything that might recall the violent crisis through\nwhich he had passed was carefully avoided. But on the second day he\nvolunteered a statement.\n\nSince that occasion Mr. Bessel has several times repeated this\nstatement--to myself among other people--varying the details as the\nnarrator of real experiences always does, but never by any chance\ncontradicting himself in any particular. And the statement he makes is\nin substance as follows.\n\nIn order to understand it clearly it is necessary to go back to his\nexperiments with Mr. Vincey before his remarkable attack. Mr. Bessel's\nfirst attempts at self-projection, in his experiments with Mr. Vincey,\nwere, as the reader will remember, unsuccessful. But through all of\nthem he was concentrating all his power and will upon getting out of the\nbody--\"willing it with all my might,\" he says. At last, almost against\nexpectation, came success. And Mr. Bessel asserts that he, being alive,\ndid actually, by an effort of will, leave his body and pass into some\nplace or state outside this world.\n\nThe release was, he asserts, instantaneous. \"At one moment I was seated\nin my chair, with my eyes tightly shut, my hands gripping the arms of\nthe chair, doing all I could to concentrate my mind on Vincey, and then\nI perceived myself outside my body--saw my body near me, but certainly\nnot containing me, with the hands relaxing and the head drooping forward\non the breast.\"\n\nNothing shakes him in his assurance of that release. He describes in a\nquiet, matter-of-fact way the new sensation he experienced. He felt he\nhad become impalpable--so much he had expected, but he had not expected\nto find himself enormously large. So, however, it would seem he became.\n\"I was a great cloud--if I may express it that way--anchored to my body.\nIt appeared to me, at first, as if I had discovered a greater self of\nwhich the conscious being in my brain was only a little part. I saw the\nAlbany and Piccadilly and Regent Street and all the rooms and places in\nthe houses, very minute and very bright and distinct, spread out below\nme like a little city seen from a balloon. Every now and then vague\nshapes like drifting wreaths of smoke made the vision a little\nindistinct, but at first I paid little heed to them. The thing that\nastonished me most, and which astonishes me still, is that I saw quite\ndistinctly the insides of the houses as well as the streets, saw little\npeople dining and talking in the private houses, men and women dining,\nplaying billiards, and drinking in restaurants and hotels, and several\nplaces of entertainment crammed with people. It was like watching the\naffairs of a glass hive.\"\n\nSuch were Mr. Bessel's exact words as I took them down when he told\nme the story. Quite forgetful of Mr. Vincey, he remained for a space\nobserving these things. Impelled by curiosity, he says, he stooped down,\nand, with the shadowy arm he found himself possessed of, attempted to\ntouch a man walking along Vigo Street. But he could not do so, though\nhis finger seemed to pass through the man. Something prevented his doing\nthis, but what it was he finds it hard to describe. He compares the\nobstacle to a sheet of glass.\n\n\"I felt as a kitten may feel,\" he said, \"when it goes for the first time\nto pat its reflection in a mirror.\" Again and again, on the occasion\nwhen I heard him tell this story, Mr. Bessel returned to that comparison\nof the sheet of glass. Yet it was not altogether a precise comparison,\nbecause, as the reader will speedily see, there were interruptions of\nthis generally impermeable resistance, means of getting through the\nbarrier to the material world again. But, naturally, there is a very\ngreat difficulty in expressing these unprecedented impressions in the\nlanguage of everyday experience.\n\nA thing that impressed him instantly, and which weighed upon him\nthroughout all this experience, was the stillness of this place--he was\nin a world without sound.\n\nAt first Mr. Bessel's mental state was an unemotional wonder. His\nthought chiefly concerned itself with where he might be. He was out of\nthe body--out of his material body, at any rate--but that was not all.\nHe believes, and I for one believe also, that he was somewhere out of\nspace, as we understand it, altogether. By a strenuous effort of will\nhe had passed out of his body into a world beyond this world, a world\nundreamt of, yet lying so close to it and so strangely situated with\nregard to it that all things on this earth are clearly visible both from\nwithout and from within in this other world about us. For a long time,\nas it seemed to him, this realisation occupied his mind to the exclusion\nof all other matters, and then he recalled the engagement with Mr.\nVincey, to which this astonishing experience was, after all, but a\nprelude.\n\nHe turned his mind to locomotion in this new body in which he found\nhimself. For a time he was unable to shift himself from his attachment\nto his earthly carcass. For a time this new strange cloud body of\nhis simply swayed, contracted, expanded, coiled, and writhed with his\nefforts to free himself, and then quite suddenly the link that bound\nhim snapped. For a moment everything was hidden by what appeared to be\nwhirling spheres of dark vapour, and then through a momentary gap he saw\nhis drooping body collapse limply, saw his lifeless head drop sideways,\nand found he was driving along like a huge cloud in a strange place of\nshadowy clouds that had the luminous intricacy of London spread like a\nmodel below.\n\nBut now he was aware that the fluctuating vapour about him was something\nmore than vapour, and the temerarious excitement of his first essay\nwas shot with fear. For he perceived, at first indistinctly, and then\nsuddenly very clearly, that he was surrounded by FACES! that each roll\nand coil of the seeming cloud-stuff was a face. And such faces! Faces of\nthin shadow, faces of gaseous tenuity. Faces like those faces that glare\nwith intolerable strangeness upon the sleeper in the evil hours of his\ndreams. Evil, greedy eyes that were full of a covetous curiosity, faces\nwith knit brows and snarling, smiling lips; their vague hands clutched\nat Mr. Bessel as he passed, and the rest of their bodies was but an\nelusive streak of trailing darkness. Never a word they said, never a\nsound from the mouths that seemed to gibber. All about him they pressed\nin that dreamy silence, passing freely through the dim mistiness that\nwas his body, gathering ever more numerously about him. And the shadowy\nMr. Bessel, now suddenly fear-stricken, drove through the silent, active\nmultitude of eyes and clutching hands.\n\nSo inhuman were these faces, so malignant their staring eyes, and\nshadowy, clawing gestures, that it did not occur to Mr. Bessel to\nattempt intercourse with these drifting creatures. Idiot phantoms, they\nseemed, children of vain desire, beings unborn and forbidden the boon of\nbeing, whose only expressions and gestures told of the envy and craving\nfor life that was their one link with existence.\n\nIt says much for his resolution that, amidst the swarming cloud of these\nnoiseless spirits of evil, he could still think of Mr. Vincey. He made\na violent effort of will and found himself, he knew not how, stooping\ntowards Staple Inn, saw Vincey sitting attentive and alert in his\narm-chair by the fire.\n\nAnd clustering also about him, as they clustered ever about all that\nlives and breathes, was another multitude of these vain voiceless\nshadows, longing, desiring, seeking some loophole into life.\n\nFor a space Mr. Bessel sought ineffectually to attract his friend's\nattention. He tried to get in front of his eyes, to move the objects in\nhis room, to touch him. But Mr. Vincey remained unaffected, ignorant of\nthe being that was so close to his own. The strange something that Mr.\nBessel has compared to a sheet of glass separated them impermeably.\n\nAnd at last Mr. Bessel did a desperate thing. I have told how that in\nsome strange way he could see not only the outside of a man as we see\nhim, but within. He extended his shadowy hand and thrust his vague black\nfingers, as it seemed, through the heedless brain.\n\nThen, suddenly, Mr. Vincey started like a man who recalls his attention\nfrom wandering thoughts, and it seemed to Mr. Bessel that a little\ndark-red body situated in the middle of Mr. Vincey's brain swelled and\nglowed as he did so. Since that experience he has been shown anatomical\nfigures of the brain, and he knows now that this is that useless\nstructure, as doctors call it, the pineal eye. For, strange as it will\nseem to many, we have, deep in our brains--where it cannot possibly\nsee any earthly light--an eye! At the time this, with the rest of the\ninternal anatomy of the brain, was quite new to him. At the sight of\nits changed appearance, however, he thrust forth his finger, and,\nrather fearful still of the consequences, touched this little spot. And\ninstantly Mr. Vincey started, and Mr. Bessel knew that he was seen.\n\nAnd at that instant it came to Mr. Bessel that evil had happened to his\nbody, and behold! a great wind blew through all that world of shadows\nand tore him away. So strong was this persuasion that he thought no more\nof Mr. Vincey, but turned about forthwith, and all the countless faces\ndrove back with him like leaves before a gale. But he returned too\nlate. In an instant he saw the body that he had left inert and\ncollapsed--lying, indeed, like the body of a man just dead--had arisen,\nhad arisen by virtue of some strength and will beyond his own. It stood\nwith staring eyes, stretching its limbs in dubious fashion.\n\nFor a moment he watched it in wild dismay, and then he stooped towards\nit. But the pane of glass had closed against him again, and he was\nfoiled. He beat himself passionately against this, and all about him the\nspirits of evil grinned and pointed and mocked. He gave way to furious\nanger. He compares himself to a bird that has fluttered heedlessly\ninto a room and is beating at the window-pane that holds it back from\nfreedom.\n\nAnd behold! the little body that had once been his was now dancing with\ndelight. He saw it shouting, though he could not hear its shouts; he saw\nthe violence of its movements grow. He watched it fling his cherished\nfurniture about in the mad delight of existence, rend his books apart,\nsmash bottles, drink heedlessly from the jagged fragments, leap and\nsmite in a passionate acceptance of living. He watched these actions\nin paralysed astonishment. Then once more he hurled himself against the\nimpassable barrier, and then with all that crew of mocking ghosts about\nhim, hurried back in dire confusion to Vincey to tell him of the outrage\nthat had come upon him.\n\nBut the brain of Vincey was now closed against apparitions, and the\ndisembodied Mr. Bessel pursued him in vain as he hurried out into\nHolborn to call a cab. Foiled and terror-stricken, Mr. Bessel swept back\nagain, to find his desecrated body whooping in a glorious frenzy down\nthe Burlington Arcade....\n\nAnd now the attentive reader begins to understand Mr. Bessel's\ninterpretation of the first part of this strange story. The being whose\nfrantic rush through London had inflicted so much injury and disaster\nhad indeed Mr. Bessel's body, but it was not Mr. Bessel. It was an evil\nspirit out of that strange world beyond existence, into which Mr. Bessel\nhad so rashly ventured. For twenty hours it held possession of him, and\nfor all those twenty hours the dispossessed spirit-body of Mr. Bessel\nwas going to and fro in that unheard-of middle world of shadows seeking\nhelp in vain. He spent many hours beating at the minds of Mr. Vincey and\nof his friend Mr. Hart. Each, as we know, he roused by his efforts. But\nthe language that might convey his situation to these helpers across the\ngulf he did not know; his feeble fingers groped vainly and powerlessly\nin their brains. Once, indeed, as we have already told, he was able to\nturn Mr. Vincey aside from his path so that he encountered the stolen\nbody in its career, but he could not make him understand the thing that\nhad happened: he was unable to draw any help from that encounter....\n\nAll through those hours the persuasion was overwhelming in Mr. Bessel's\nmind that presently his body would be killed by its furious tenant, and\nhe would have to remain in this shadow-land for evermore. So that those\nlong hours were a growing agony of fear. And ever as he hurried to and\nfro in his ineffectual excitement, innumerable spirits of that world\nabout him mobbed him and confused his mind. And ever an envious\napplauding multitude poured after their successful fellow as he went\nupon his glorious career.\n\nFor that, it would seem, must be the life of these bodiless things of\nthis world that is the shadow of our world. Ever they watch, coveting\na way into a mortal body, in order that they may descend, as furies and\nfrenzies, as violent lusts and mad, strange impulses, rejoicing in the\nbody they have won. For Mr. Bessel was not the only human soul in that\nplace. Witness the fact that he met first one, and afterwards several\nshadows of men, men like himself, it seemed, who had lost their bodies\neven it may be as he had lost his, and wandered, despairingly, in that\nlost world that is neither life nor death. They could not speak because\nthat world is silent, yet he knew them for men because of their dim\nhuman bodies, and because of the sadness of their faces.\n\nBut how they had come into that world he could not tell, nor where the\nbodies they had lost might be, whether they still raved about the earth,\nor whether they were closed forever in death against return. That they\nwere the spirits of the dead neither he nor I believe. But Doctor Wilson\nPaget thinks they are the rational souls of men who are lost in madness\non the earth.\n\nAt last Mr. Bessel chanced upon a place where a little crowd of such\ndisembodied silent creatures was gathered, and thrusting through them\nhe saw below a brightly-lit room, and four or five quiet gentlemen and a\nwoman, a stoutish woman dressed in black bombazine and sitting awkwardly\nin a chair with her head thrown back. He knew her from her portraits to\nbe Mrs. Bullock, the medium. And he perceived that tracts and structures\nin her brain glowed and stirred as he had seen the pineal eye in the\nbrain of Mr. Vincey glow. The light was very fitful; sometimes it was a\nbroad illumination, and sometimes merely a faint twilight spot, and it\nshifted slowly about her brain. She kept on talking and writing with one\nhand. And Mr. Bessel saw that the crowding shadows of men about him,\nand a great multitude of the shadow spirits of that shadowland, were all\nstriving and thrusting to touch the lighted regions of her brain. As one\ngained her brain or another was thrust away, her voice and the writing\nof her hand changed. So that what she said was disorderly and confused\nfor the most part; now a fragment of one soul's message, and now a\nfragment of another's, and now she babbled the insane fancies of the\nspirits of vain desire. Then Mr. Bessel understood that she spoke\nfor the spirit that had touch of her, and he began to struggle very\nfuriously towards her. But he was on the outside of the crowd and at\nthat time he could not reach her, and at last, growing anxious, he went\naway to find what had happened meanwhile to his body. For a long time\nhe went to and fro seeking it in vain and fearing that it must have been\nkilled, and then he found it at the bottom of the shaft in Baker Street,\nwrithing furiously and cursing with pain. Its leg and an arm and two\nribs had been broken by its fall. Moreover, the evil spirit was angry\nbecause his time had been so short and because of the painmaking violent\nmovements and casting his body about.\n\nAnd at that Mr. Bessel returned with redoubled earnestness to the room\nwhere the seance was going on, and so soon as he had thrust himself\nwithin sight of the place he saw one of the men who stood about the\nmedium looking at his watch as if he meant that the seance should\npresently end. At that a great number of the shadows who had been\nstriving turned away with gestures of despair. But the thought that the\nseance was almost over only made Mr. Bessel the more earnest, and he\nstruggled so stoutly with his will against the others that presently he\ngained the woman's brain. It chanced that just at that moment it glowed\nvery brightly, and in that instant she wrote the message that Doctor\nWilson Paget preserved. And then the other shadows and the cloud of evil\nspirits about him had thrust Mr. Bessel away from her, and for all the\nrest of the seance he could regain her no more.\n\nSo he went back and watched through the long hours at the bottom of\nthe shaft where the evil spirit lay in the stolen body it had maimed,\nwrithing and cursing, and weeping and groaning, and learning the lesson\nof pain. And towards dawn the thing he had waited for happened, the\nbrain glowed brightly and the evil spirit came out, and Mr. Bessel\nentered the body he had feared he should never enter again. As he did\nso, the silence--the brooding silence--ended; he heard the tumult of\ntraffic and the voices of people overhead, and that strange world that\nis the shadow of our world--the dark and silent shadows of ineffectual\ndesire and the shadows of lost men--vanished clean away.\n\nHe lay there for the space of about three hours before he was found. And\nin spite of the pain and suffering of his wounds, and of the dim damp\nplace in which he lay; in spite of the tears--wrung from him by his\nphysical distress--his heart was full of gladness to know that he was\nnevertheless back once more in the kindly world of men.\n\n\n\n\n11. MR. BRISHER'S TREASURE\n\n\"You can't be TOO careful WHO you marry,\" said Mr. Brisher, and pulled\nthoughtfully with a fat-wristed hand at the lank moustache that hides\nhis want of chin.\n\n\"That's why--\" I ventured.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Brisher, with a solemn light in his bleary, blue-grey\neyes, moving his head expressively and breathing alcohol INTIMATELY at\nme. \"There's lots as 'ave 'ad a try at me--many as I could name in this\ntown--but none 'ave done it--none.\"\n\nI surveyed the flushed countenance, the equatorial expansion, the\nmasterly carelessness of his attire, and heaved a sigh to think that\nby reason of the unworthiness of women he must needs be the last of his\nrace.\n\n\"I was a smart young chap when I was younger,\" said Mr. Brisher. \"I 'ad\nmy work cut out. But I was very careful--very. And I got through...\"\n\nHe leant over the taproom table and thought visibly on the subject of my\ntrustworthiness. I was relieved at last by his confidence.\n\n\"I was engaged once,\" he said at last, with a reminiscent eye on the\nshuv-a'penny board.\n\n\"So near as that?\"\n\nHe looked at me. \"So near as that. Fact is--\" He looked about him,\nbrought his face close to mine, lowered his voice, and fenced off an\nunsympathetic world with a grimy hand. \"If she ain't dead or married to\nsome one else or anything--I'm engaged still. Now.\" He confirmed this\nstatement with nods and facial contortions. \"STILL,\" he said, ending the\npantomime, and broke into a reckless smile at my surprise. \"ME!\"\n\n\"Run away,\" he explained further, with coruscating eyebrows. \"Come 'ome.\n\n\"That ain't all.\n\n\"You'd 'ardly believe it,\" he said, \"but I found a treasure. Found a\nregular treasure.\"\n\nI fancied this was irony, and did not, perhaps, greet it with proper\nsurprise. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I found a treasure. And come 'ome. I tell you\nI could surprise you with things that has happened to me.\" And for some\ntime he was content to repeat that he had found a treasure--and left it.\n\nI made no vulgar clamour for a story, but I became attentive to Mr.\nBrisher's bodily needs, and presently I led him back to the deserted\nlady.\n\n\"She was a nice girl,\" he said--a little sadly, I thought. \"AND\nrespectable.\"\n\nHe raised his eyebrows and tightened his mouth to express extreme\nrespectability--beyond the likes of us elderly men.\n\n\"It was a long way from 'ere. Essex, in fact. Near Colchester. It was\nwhen I was up in London--in the buildin' trade. I was a smart young\nchap then, I can tell you. Slim. 'Ad best clo'es 's good as anybody.\n'At--SILK 'at, mind you.\" Mr. Brisher's hand shot above his head towards\nthe infinite to indicate it silk hat of the highest. \"Umbrella--nice\numbrella with a 'orn 'andle. Savin's. Very careful I was....\"\n\nHe was pensive for a little while, thinking, as we must all come to\nthink sooner or later, of the vanished brightness of youth. But he\nrefrained, as one may do in taprooms, from the obvious moral.\n\n\"I got to know 'er through a chap what was engaged to 'er sister. She\nwas stopping in London for a bit with an aunt that 'ad a 'am an' beef\nshop. This aunt was very particular--they was all very particular\npeople, all 'er people was--and wouldn't let 'er sister go out with this\nfeller except 'er other sister, MY girl that is, went with them. So 'e\nbrought me into it, sort of to ease the crowding. We used to go walks in\nBattersea Park of a Sunday afternoon. Me in my topper, and 'im in 'is;\nand the girl's--well--stylish. There wasn't many in Battersea Park 'ad\nthe larf of us. She wasn't what you'd call pretty, but a nicer girl I\nnever met. _I_ liked 'er from the start, and, well--though I say it who\nshouldn't--she liked me. You know 'ow it is, I dessay?\"\n\nI pretended I did.\n\n\"And when this chap married 'er sister--'im and me was great\nfriends--what must 'e do but arst me down to Colchester, close by where\nShe lived. Naturally I was introjuced to 'er people, and well, very\nsoon, her and me was engaged.\"\n\nHe repeated \"engaged.\"\n\n\"She lived at 'ome with 'er father and mother, quite the lady, in a very\nnice little 'ouse with a garden--and remarkable respectable people they\nwas. Rich you might call 'em a'most. They owned their own 'ouse--got\nit out of the Building Society, and cheap because the chap who had it\nbefore was a burglar and in prison--and they 'ad a bit of free'old land,\nand some cottages and money 'nvested--all nice and tight: they was what\nyou'd call snug and warm. I tell you, I was On. Furniture too. Why! They\n'ad a pianner. Jane--'er name was Jane--used to play it Sundays, and\nvery nice she played too. There wasn't 'ardly a 'im toon in the book she\nCOULDN'T play...\n\n\"Many's the evenin' we've met and sung 'ims there, me and 'er and the\nfamily.\n\n\"'Er father was quite a leadin' man in chapel. You should ha' seen him\nSundays, interruptin' the minister and givin' out 'ims. He had gold\nspectacles, I remember, and used to look over 'em at you while he sang\nhearty--he was always great on singing 'earty to the Lord--and when HE\ngot out o' toon 'arf the people went after 'im--always. 'E was that sort\nof man. And to walk be'ind 'im in 'is nice black clo'es--'is 'at was a\nbrimmer--made one regular proud to be engaged to such a father-in-law.\nAnd when the summer came I went down there and stopped a fortnight.\n\n\"Now, you know there was a sort of Itch,\" said Mr. Brisher. \"We wanted\nto marry, me and Jane did, and get things settled. But 'E said I 'ad\nto get a proper position first. Consequently there was a Itch.\nConsequently, when I went down there, I was anxious to show that I was a\ngood useful sort of chap like. Show I could do pretty nearly everything\nlike. See?\"\n\nI made a sympathetic noise.\n\n\"And down at the bottom of their garden was a bit of wild part like. So\nI says to 'im, 'Why don't you 'ave a rockery 'ere?' I says. 'It 'ud look\nnice.'\n\n\"'Too much expense,' he says.\n\n\"'Not a penny,' says I. 'I'm a dab at rockeries. Lemme make you one.'\nYou see, I'd 'elped my brother make a rockery in the beer garden be'ind\n'is tap, so I knew 'ow to do it to rights. 'Lemme make you one,' I says.\n'It's 'olidays, but I'm that sort of chap, I 'ate doing nothing,' I\nsays. 'I'll make you one to rights.' And the long and the short of it\nwas, he said I might.\n\n\"And that's 'ow I come on the treasure.\"\n\n\"What treasure?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why!\" said Mr. Brisher, \"the treasure I'm telling you about, what's the\nreason why I never married.\"\n\n\"What!--a treasure--dug up?\"\n\n\"Yes--buried wealth--treasure trove. Come out of the ground. What I\nkept on saying--regular treasure....\" He looked at me with unusual\ndisrespect.\n\n\"It wasn't more than a foot deep, not the top of it,\" he said. \"I'd\n'ardly got thirsty like, before I come on the corner.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" I said. \"I didn't understand.\"\n\n\"Why! Directly I 'it the box I knew it was treasure. A sort of instinct\ntold me. Something seemed to shout inside of me--'Now's your chance--lie\nlow.' It's lucky I knew the laws of treasure trove or I'd 'ave been\nshoutin' there and then. I daresay you know--\"\n\n\"Crown bags it,\" I said, \"all but one per cent. Go on. It's a shame.\nWhat did you do?\"\n\n\"Uncovered the top of the box. There wasn't anybody in the garden or\nabout like. Jane was 'elping 'er mother do the 'ouse. I WAS excited--I\ntell you. I tried the lock and then gave a whack at the hinges. Open it\ncame. Silver coins--full! Shining. It made me tremble to see 'em. And\njest then--I'm blessed if the dustman didn't come round the back of the\n'ouse. It pretty nearly gave me 'eart disease to think what a fool I\nwas to 'ave that money showing. And directly after I 'eard the chap next\ndoor--'e was 'olidaying, too--I 'eard him watering 'is beans. If only\n'e'd looked over the fence!\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"Kicked the lid on again and covered it up like a shot, and went on\ndigging about a yard away from it--like mad. And my face, so to speak,\nwas laughing on its own account till I had it hid. I tell you I was\nregular scared like at my luck. I jest thought that it 'ad to be\nkep' close and that was all. 'Treasure,' I kep' whisperin' to myself,\n'Treasure' and ''undreds of pounds, 'undreds, 'undreds of pounds.'\nWhispering to myself like, and digging like blazes. It seemed to me the\nbox was regular sticking out and showing, like your legs do under the\nsheets in bed, and I went and put all the earth I'd got out of my 'ole\nfor the rockery slap on top of it. I WAS in a sweat. And in the midst of\nit all out toddles 'er father. He didn't say anything to me, jest stood\nbehind me and stared, but Jane tole me afterwards when he went indoors,\n'e says, 'That there jackanapes of yours, Jane'--he always called me\na jackanapes some'ow--'knows 'ow to put 'is back into it after all.'\nSeemed quite impressed by it, 'e did.\"\n\n\"How long was the box?\" I asked, suddenly.\n\n\"'Ow long?\" said Mr. Brisher.\n\n\"Yes--in length?\"\n\n\"Oh! 'bout so-by-so.\" Mr. Brisher indicated a moderate-sized trunk.\n\n\"FULL?\" said I.\n\n\"Full up of silver coins--'arf-crowns, I believe.\"\n\n\"Why!\" I cried, \"that would mean--hundreds of pounds.\"\n\n\"Thousands,\" said Mr. Brisher, in a sort of sad calm. \"I calc'lated it\nout.\"\n\n\"But how did they get there?\"\n\n\"All I know is what I found. What I thought at the time was this. The\nchap who'd owned the 'ouse before 'er father 'd been a regular slap-up\nburglar. What you'd call a 'igh-class criminal. Used to drive 'is\ntrap--like Peace did.\" Mr. Brisher meditated on the difficulties of\nnarration and embarked on a complicated parenthesis. \"I don't know if I\ntold you it'd been a burglar's 'ouse before it was my girl's father's,\nand I knew 'e'd robbed a mail train once, I did know that. It seemed to\nme--\"\n\n\"That's very likely,\" I said. \"But what did you do?\"\n\n\"Sweated,\" said Mr. Brisher. \"Regular run orf me. All that morning,\"\nsaid Mr. Brisher, \"I was at it, pretending to make that rockery and\nwondering what I should do. I'd 'ave told 'er father p'r'aps, only I was\ndoubtful of 'is honesty--I was afraid he might rob me of it like, and\ngive it up to the authorities--and besides, considering I was marrying\ninto the family, I thought it would be nicer like if it came through me.\nPut me on a better footing, so to speak. Well, I 'ad three days before\nme left of my 'olidays, so there wasn't no hurry, so I covered it up and\nwent on digging, and tried to puzzle out 'ow I was to make sure of it.\nOnly I couldn't.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Mr. Brisher, \"AND I thought. Once I got regular\ndoubtful whether I'd seen it or not, and went down to it and 'ad it\nuncovered again, just as her ma came out to 'ang up a bit of washin'\nshe'd done. Jumps again! Afterwards I was just thinking I'd 'ave another\ngo at it, when Jane comes to tell me dinner was ready. 'You'll want it,'\nshe said, 'seeing all the 'ole you've dug.'\n\n\"I was in a regular daze all dinner, wondering whether that chap next\ndoor wasn't over the fence and filling 'is pockets. But in the afternoon\nI got easier in my mind--it seemed to me it must 'ave been there so long\nit was pretty sure to stop a bit longer--and I tried to get up a bit of\na discussion to dror out the old man and see what 'E thought of treasure\ntrove.\"\n\nMr. Brisher paused, and affected amusement at the memory.\n\n\"The old man was a scorcher,\" he said; \"a regular scorcher.\"\n\n\"What!\" said I; \"did he--?\"\n\n\"It was like this,\" explained Mr. Brisher, laying a friendly hand on my\narm and breathing into my face to calm me. \"Just to dror 'im out, I told\na story of a chap I said I knew--pretendin', you know--who'd found a\nsovring in a novercoat 'e'd borrowed. I said 'e stuck to it, but I said\nI wasn't sure whether that was right or not. And then the old man\nbegan. Lor'! 'e DID let me 'ave it!\" Mr. Brisher affected an insincere\namusement. \"'E was, well--what you might call a rare 'and at Snacks.\nSaid that was the sort of friend 'e'd naturally expect me to 'ave. Said\n'e'd naturally expect that from the friend of a out-of-work loafer who\ntook up with daughters who didn't belong to 'im. There! I couldn't tell\nyou 'ARF 'e said. 'E went on most outrageous. I stood up to 'im about\nit, just to dror 'im out. 'Wouldn't you stick to a 'arf-sov', not if you\nfound it in the street?' I says. 'Certainly not,' 'e says; 'certainly\nI wouldn't.' 'What! not if you found it as a sort of treasure?'\n'Young man,' 'e says, 'there's 'i'er 'thority than mine--Render unto\nCaesar'--what is it? Yes. Well, he fetched up that. A rare 'and at\n'itting you over the 'ed with the Bible, was the old man. And so he\nwent on. 'E got to such Snacks about me at last I couldn't stand it. I'd\npromised Jane not to answer 'im back, but it got a bit TOO thick. I--I\ngive it 'im...\"\n\nMr. Brisher, by means of enigmatical facework, tried to make me think he\nhad had the best of that argument, but I knew better.\n\n\"I went out in a 'uff at last. But not before I was pretty sure I 'ad\nto lift that treasure by myself. The only thing that kep' me up was\nthinking 'ow I'd take it out of 'im when I 'ad the cash.\"\n\nThere was a lengthy pause.\n\n\"Now, you'd 'ardly believe it, but all them three days I never 'ad a\nchance at the blessed treasure, never got out not even a 'arf-crown.\nThere was always a Somethink--always.\n\n\"'Stonishing thing it isn't thought of more,\" said Mr. Brisher. \"Finding\ntreasure's no great shakes. It's gettin' it. I don't suppose I slep' a\nwink any of those nights, thinking where I was to take it, what I was to\ndo with it, 'ow I was to explain it. It made me regular ill. And days I\nwas that dull, it made Jane regular 'uffy. 'You ain't the same chap you\nwas in London,' she says, several times. I tried to lay it on 'er father\nand 'is Snacks, but bless you, she knew better. What must she 'ave but\nthat I'd got another girl on my mind! Said I wasn't True. Well, we had a\nbit of a row. But I was that set on the Treasure, I didn't seem to mind\na bit Anything she said.\n\n\"Well, at last I got a sort of plan. I was always a bit good at\nplanning, though carrying out isn't so much in my line. I thought it\nall out and settled on a plan. First, I was going to take all my pockets\nfull of these 'ere 'arf-crowns--see?--and afterwards as I shall tell.\n\n\"Well, I got to that state I couldn't think of getting at the Treasure\nagain in the daytime, so I waited until the night before I had to go,\nand then, when everything was still, up I gets and slips down to\nthe back door, meaning to get my pockets full. What must I do in the\nscullery but fall over a pail! Up gets 'er father with a gun--'e was a\nlight sleeper was 'er father, and very suspicious and there was me: 'ad\nto explain I'd come down to the pump for a drink because my water-bottle\nwas bad. 'E didn't let me off a Snack or two over that bit, you lay a\nbob.\"\n\n\"And you mean to say--\" I began.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Mr. Brisher. \"I say, I'd made my plan. That put the\nkybosh on one bit, but it didn't 'urt the general scheme not a bit.\nI went and I finished that rockery next day, as though there wasn't a\nSnack in the world; cemented over the stones, I did, dabbed it green and\neverythink. I put a dab of green just to show where the box was. They\nall came and looked at it, and sai 'ow nice it was--even 'e was a bit\nsofter like to see it, and all he said was, 'It's a pity you can't\nalways work like that, then you might get something definite to do,' he\nsays.\n\n\"'Yes,' I says--I couldn't 'elp it--'I put a lot in that rockery,' I\nsays, like that. See? 'I put a lot in that rockery'--meaning--\"\n\n\"I see,\" said I--for Mr. Brisher is apt to overelaborate his jokes.\n\n\"_'E_ didn't,\" said Mr. Brisher. \"Not then, anyhow.\n\n\"Ar'ever--after all that was over, off I set for London.... Orf I set\nfor London.\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"On'y I wasn't going to no London,\" said Mr. Brisher, with sudden\nanimation, and thrusting his face into mine. \"No fear! What do YOU\nthink?\n\n\"I didn't go no further than Colchester--not a yard.\n\n\"I'd left the spade just where I could find it. I'd got everything\nplanned and right. I 'ired a little trap in Colchester, and pretended I\nwanted to go to Ipswich and stop the night, and come back next day, and\nthe chap I 'ired it from made me leave two sovrings on it right away,\nand off I set.\n\n\"I didn't go to no Ipswich neither.\n\n\"Midnight the 'orse and trap was 'itched by the little road that ran by\nthe cottage where 'e lived--not sixty yards off, it wasn't--and I was at\nit like a good 'un. It was jest the night for such games--overcast--but\na trifle too 'ot, and all round the sky there was summer lightning and\npresently a thunderstorm. Down it came. First big drops in a sort of\nfizzle, then 'ail. I kep'on. I whacked at it--I didn't dream the old man\nwould 'ear. I didn't even trouble to go quiet with the spade, and the\nthunder and lightning and 'ail seemed to excite me like. I shouldn't\nwonder if I was singing. I got so 'ard at it I clean forgot the thunder\nand the 'orse and trap. I precious soon got the box showing, and started\nto lift it....\"\n\n\"Heavy?\" I said.\n\n\"I couldn't no more lift it than fly. I WAS sick. I'd never thought of\nthat I got regular wild--I tell you, I cursed. I got sort of outrageous.\nI didn't think of dividing it like for the minute, and even then I\ncouldn't 'ave took money about loose in a trap. I hoisted one end sort\nof wild like, and over the whole show went with a tremenjous noise.\nPerfeck smash of silver. And then right on the heels of that, Flash!\nLightning like the day! and there was the back door open and the old\nman coming down the garden with 'is blooming old gun. He wasn't not a\n'undred yards away!\n\n\"I tell you I was that upset--I didn't think what I was doing. I never\nstopped-not even to fill my pockets. I went over the fence like a shot,\nand ran like one o'clock for the trap, cussing and swearing as I went. I\nWAS in a state....\n\n\"And will you believe me, when I got to the place where I'd left the\n'orse and trap, they'd gone. Orf! When I saw that I 'adn't a cuss left\nfor it. I jest danced on the grass, and when I'd danced enough I started\noff to London.... I was done.\"\n\nMr. Brisher was pensive for an interval. \"I was done,\" he repeated, very\nbitterly.\n\n\"Well?\" I said.\n\n\"That's all,\" said Mr. Brisher.\n\n\"You didn't go back?\"\n\n\"No fear. I'd 'ad enough of THAT blooming treasure, any'ow for a bit.\nBesides, I didn't know what was done to chaps who tried to collar a\ntreasure trove. I started off for London there and then....\"\n\n\"And you never went back?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"But about Jane? Did you write?\"\n\n\"Three times, fishing like. And no answer. We'd parted in a bit of a\n'uff on account of 'er being jealous. So that I couldn't make out for\ncertain what it meant.\n\n\"I didn't know what to do. I didn't even know whether the old man knew\nit was me. I sort of kep' an eye open on papers to see when he'd give\nup that treasure to the Crown, as I hadn't a doubt 'e would, considering\n'ow respectable he'd always been.\"\n\n\"And did he?\"\n\nMr. Brisher pursed his mouth and moved his head slowly from side to\nside. \"Not 'IM,\" he said.\n\n\"Jane was a nice girl,\" he said, \"a thorough nice girl mind you, if\njealous, and there's no knowing I mightn't 'ave gone back to 'er after a\nbit. I thought if he didn't give up the treasure I might 'ave a sort\nof 'old on 'im.... Well, one day I looks as usual under Colchester--and\nthere I saw 'is name. What for, d'yer think?\"\n\nI could not guess.\n\nMr. Brisher's voice sank to a whisper, and once more he spoke behind\nhis hand. His manner was suddenly suffused with a positive joy. \"Issuing\ncounterfeit coins,\" he said. \"Counterfeit coins!\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say--?\"\n\n\"Yes-It. Bad. Quite a long case they made of it. But they got 'im,\nthough he dodged tremenjous. Traced 'is 'aving passed, oh!--nearly a\ndozen bad 'arf-crowns.\"\n\n\"And you didn't--?\"\n\n\"No fear. And it didn't do 'IM much good to say it was treasure trove.\"\n\n\n\n\n12. MISS WINCHELSEA'S HEART\n\nMiss Winchelsea was going to Rome. The matter had filled her mind for\na month or more, and had overflowed so abundantly into her conversation\nthat quite a number of people who were not going to Rome, and who were\nnot likely to go to Rome, had made it a personal grievance against her.\nSome indeed had attempted quite unavailingly to convince her that Rome\nwas not nearly such a desirable place as it was reported to be, and\nothers had gone so far as to suggest behind her back that she was\ndreadfully \"stuck up\" about \"that Rome of hers.\" And little Lily\nHardhurst had told her friend Mr. Binns that so far as she was concerned\nMiss Winchelsea might \"go to her old Rome and stop there; SHE (Miss Lily\nHardhurst) wouldn't grieve.\" And the way in which Miss Winchelsea put\nherself upon terms of personal tenderness with Horace and Benvenuto\nCellini and Raphael and Shelley and Keats--if she had been Shelley's\nwidow she could not have professed a keener interest in his grave--was\na matter of universal astonishment. Her dress was a triumph of tactful\ndiscretion, sensible, but not too \"touristy\"--Miss Winchelsea, had a\ngreat dread of being \"touristy\"--and her Baedeker was carried in a cover\nof grey to hide its glaring red. She made a prim and pleasant little\nfigure on the Charing Cross platform, in spite of her swelling pride,\nwhen at last the great day dawned, and she could start for Rome. The\nday was bright, the Channel passage would be pleasant, and all the\nomens promised well. There was the gayest sense of adventure in this\nunprecedented departure.\n\nShe was going with two friends who had been fellow-students with her\nat the training college, nice honest girls both, though not so good at\nhistory and literature as Miss Winchelsea. They both looked up to her\nimmensely, though physically they had to look down, and she anticipated\nsome pleasant times to be spent in \"stirring them up\" to her own pitch\nof aesthetic and historical enthusiasm. They had secured seats already,\nand welcomed her effusively at the carriage door. In the instant\ncriticism of the encounter she noted that Fanny had a slightly\n\"touristy\" leather strap, and that Helen had succumbed to a serge jacket\nwith side pockets, into which her hands were thrust. But they were much\ntoo happy with themselves and the expedition for their friend to\nattempt any hint at the moment about these things. As soon as the first\necstasies were over--Fanny's enthusiasm was a little noisy and crude,\nand consisted mainly in emphatic repetitions of \"Just FANCY! we're\ngoing to Rome, my dear!--Rome!\"--they gave their attention to their\nfellow-travellers. Helen was anxious to secure a compartment to\nthemselves, and, in order to discourage intruders, got out and planted\nherself firmly on the step. Miss Winchelsea peeped out over her\nshoulder, and made sly little remarks about the accumulating people on\nthe platform, at which Fanny laughed gleefully.\n\nThey were travelling with one of Mr. Thomas Gunn's parties--fourteen\ndays in Rome for fourteen pounds. They did not belong to the personally\nconducted party of course--Miss Winchelsea had seen to that--but they\ntravelled with it because of the convenience of that arrangement. The\npeople were the oddest mixture, and wonderfully amusing. There was a\nvociferous red-faced polyglot personal conductor in a pepper-and-salt\nsuit, very long in the arms and legs and very active. He shouted\nproclamations. When he wanted to speak to people he stretched out an arm\nand held them until his purpose was accomplished. One hand was full of\npapers, tickets, counterfoils of tourists. The people of the personally\nconducted party were, it seemed, of two sorts; people the conductor\nwanted and could not find, and people he did not want and who followed\nhim in a steadily growing tail up and down the platform. These people\nseemed, indeed, to think that their one chance of reaching Rome lay\nin keeping close to him. Three little old ladies were particularly\nenergetic in his pursuit, and at last maddened him to the pitch of\nclapping them into a carriage and daring them to emerge again. For the\nrest of the time, one, two, or three of their heads protruded from the\nwindow wailing enquiries about \"a little wickerwork box\" whenever he\ndrew near. There was a very stout man with a very stout wife in shiny\nblack; there was a little old man like an aged hostler.\n\n\"What CAN such people want in Rome?\" asked Miss Winchelsea. \"What can it\nmean to them?\" There was a very tall curate in a very small straw hat,\nand a very short curate encumbered by a long camera stand. The contrast\namused Fanny very much. Once they heard some one calling for \"Snooks.\"\n\"I always thought that name was invented by novelists,\" said Miss\nWinchelsea. \"Fancy! Snooks. I wonder which IS Mr. Snooks.\" Finally they\npicked out a very stout and resolute little man in a large check suit.\n\"If he isn't Snooks, he ought to be,\" said Miss Winchelsea.\n\nPresently the conductor discovered Helen's attempt at a corner in\ncarriages. \"Room for five,\" he bawled with a parallel translation on\nhis fingers. A party of four together--mother, father, and two\ndaughters--blundered in, all greatly excited. \"It's all right, Ma, you\nlet me,\" said one of the daughters, hitting her mother's bonnet with\na handbag she struggled to put in the rack. Miss Winchelsea detested\npeople who banged about and called their mother \"Ma.\" A young man\ntravelling alone followed. He was not at all \"touristy\" in his costume,\nMiss Winchelsea observed; his Gladstone bag was of good pleasant leather\nwith labels reminiscent of Luxembourg and Ostend, and his boots, though\nbrown, were not vulgar. He carried an overcoat on his arm. Before these\npeople had properly settled in their places, came an inspection of\ntickets and a slamming of doors, and behold! they were gliding out of\nCharing Cross station on their way to Rome.\n\n\"Fancy!\" cried Fanny, \"we are going to Rome, my dear! Rome! I don't seem\nto believe it, even now.\"\n\nMiss Winchelsea suppressed Fanny's emotions with a little smile, and\nthe lady who was called \"Ma\" explained to people in general why they\nhad \"cut it so close\" at the station. The two daughters called her \"Ma\"\nseveral times, toned her down in a tactless effective way, and drove her\nat last to the muttered inventory of a basket of travelling requisites.\nPresently she looked up. \"Lor'!\" she said, \"I didn't bring THEM!\"\nBoth the daughters said \"Oh, Ma!\" but what \"them\" was did not appear.\nPresently Fanny produced Hare's Walks in Rome, a sort of mitigated\nguide-book very popular among Roman visitors; and the father of the two\ndaughters began to examine his books of tickets minutely, apparently in\na search after English words. When he had looked at the tickets for a\nlong time right way up, he turned them upside down. Then he produced\na fountain pen and dated them with considerable care. The young man,\nhaving completed an unostentatious survey of his fellow travellers,\nproduced a book and fell to reading. When Helen and Fanny were looking\nout of the window at Chiselhurst--the place interested Fanny because the\npoor dear Empress of the French used to live there--Miss Winchelsea took\nthe opportunity to observe the book the young man held. It was not a\nguide-book, but a little thin volume of poetry--BOUND. She glanced at\nhis face--it seemed a refined pleasant face to her hasty glance. He wore\na little gilt pince-nez. \"Do you think she lives there now?\" said Fanny,\nand Miss Winchelsea's inspection came to an end.\n\nFor the rest of the journey Miss Winchelsea talked little, and what she\nsaid was as pleasant and as stamped with refinement as she could make\nit. Her voice was always low and clear and pleasant, and she took care\nthat on this occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant.\nAs they came under the white cliffs the young man put his book of poetry\naway, and when at last the train stopped beside the boat, he displayed\na graceful alacrity with the impedimenta of Miss Winchelsea and her\nfriends. Miss Winchelsea hated nonsense, but she was pleased to see\nthe young man perceived at once that they were ladies, and helped\nthem without any violent geniality; and how nicely he showed that his\ncivilities were to be no excuse for further intrusions. None of her\nlittle party had been out of England before, and they were all excited\nand a little nervous at the Channel passage. They stood in a little\ngroup in a good place near the middle of the boat--the young man had\ntaken Miss Winchelsea's carry-all there and had told her it was a good\nplace--and they watched the white shores of Albion recede and quoted\nShakespeare and made quiet fun of their fellow travellers in the English\nway.\n\nThey were particularly amused at the precautions the bigger-sized people\nhad taken against the little waves--cut lemons and flasks prevailed, one\nlady lay full-length in a deck chair with a handkerchief over her face,\nand a very broad resolute man in a bright brown \"touristy\" suit walked\nall the way from England to France along the deck, with his legs\nas widely apart as Providence permitted. These were all excellent\nprecautions, and, nobody was ill. The personally conducted party pursued\nthe conductor about the deck with enquiries in a manner that suggested\nto Helen's mind the rather vulgar image of hens with a piece of bacon\npeel, until at last he went into hiding below. And the young man with\nthe thin volume of poetry stood at the stern watching England receding,\nlooking rather lonely and sad to Miss Winchelsea's eye.\n\nAnd then came Calais and tumultuous novelties, and the young man had not\nforgotten Miss Winchelsea's hold-all and the other little things. All\nthree girls, though they had passed government examinations in French\nto any extent, were stricken with a dumb shame of their accents, and\nthe young man was very useful. And he did not intrude. He put them in a\ncomfortable carriage and raised his hat and went away. Miss Winchelsea\nthanked him in her best manner--a pleasing, cultivated manner--and Fanny\nsaid he was \"nice\" almost before he was out of earshot. \"I wonder what\nhe can be,\" said Helen. \"He's going to Italy, because I noticed green\ntickets in his book.\" Miss Winchelsea almost told them of the poetry,\nand decided not to do so. And presently the carriage windows seized hold\nupon them and the young man was forgotten. It made them feel that they\nwere doing an educated sort of thing to travel through a country whose\ncommonest advertisements were in idiomatic French, and Miss Winchelsea\nmade unpatriotic comparisons because there were weedy little sign-board\nadvertisements by the rail side instead of the broad hoardings that\ndeface the landscape in our land. But the north of France is really\nuninteresting country, and after a time Fanny reverted to Hare's Walks\nand Helen initiated lunch. Miss Winchelsea awoke out of a happy reverie;\nshe had been trying to realise, she said, that she was actually going to\nRome, but she perceived at Helen's suggestion that she was hungry, and\nthey lunched out of their baskets very cheerfully. In the afternoon they\nwere tired and silent until Helen made tea. Miss Winchelsea might have\ndozed, only she knew Fanny slept with her mouth open; and as their\nfellow passengers were two rather nice critical-looking ladies of\nuncertain age--who knew French well enough to talk it--she employed\nherself in keeping Fanny awake. The rhythm of the train became\ninsistent, and the streaming landscape outside became at last quite\npainful to the eye. They were already dreadfully tired of travelling\nbefore their night's stoppage came.\n\nThe stoppage for the night was brightened by the appearance of the young\nman, and his manners were all that could be desired and his French quite\nserviceable. His coupons availed for the same hotel as theirs, and by\nchance as it seemed he sat next Miss Winchelsea at the table d'hote.\nIn spite of her enthusiasm for Rome, she had thought out some such\npossibility very thoroughly, and when he ventured to make a remark upon\nthe tediousness of travelling--he let the soup and fish go by before he\ndid this--she did not simply assent to his proposition, but responded\nwith another. They were soon comparing their journeys, and Helen and\nFanny were cruelly overlooked in the conversation. It was to be the same\njourney, they found; one day for the galleries at Florence--\"from what I\nhear,\" said the young man, \"it is barely enough,\"--and the rest at Rome.\nHe talked of Rome very pleasantly; he was evidently quite well read, and\nhe quoted Horace about Soracte. Miss Winchelsea had \"done\" that book of\nHorace for her matriculation, and was delighted to cap his quotation. It\ngave a sort of tone to things, this incident--a touch of refinement to\nmere chatting. Fanny expressed a few emotions, and Helen interpolated\na few sensible remarks, but the bulk of the talk on the girls' side\nnaturally fell to Miss Winchelsea.\n\nBefore they reached Rome this young man was tacitly of their party. They\ndid not know his name nor what he was, but it seemed he taught, and Miss\nWinchelsea had a shrewd idea he was an extension lecturer. At any rate\nhe was something of that sort, something gentlemanly and refined without\nbeing opulent and impossible. She tried once or twice to ascertain\nwhether he came from Oxford or Cambridge, but he missed her timid\nimportunities. She tried to get him to make remarks about those places\nto see if he would say \"come up\" to them instead of \"go down\"--she knew\nthat was how you told a 'Varsity man. He used the word \"'Varsity\"--not\nuniversity--in quite the proper way.\n\nThey saw as much of Mr. Ruskin's Florence as the brief time permitted;\nhe met them in the Pitti Gallery and went round with them, chatting\nbrightly, and evidently very grateful for their recognition. He knew a\ngreat deal about art, and all four enjoyed the morning immensely. It was\nfine to go round recognising old favourites and finding new beauties,\nespecially while so many people fumbled helplessly with Baedeker. Nor\nwas he a bit of a prig, Miss Winchelsea said, and indeed she detested\nprigs. He had a distinct undertone of humour, and was funny, for\nexample, without being vulgar, at the expense of the quaint work of\nBeato Angelico. He had a grave seriousness beneath it all, and was quick\nto seize the moral lessons of the pictures. Fanny went softly among\nthese masterpieces; she admitted \"she knew so little about them,\" and\nshe confessed that to her they were \"all beautiful.\" Fanny's \"beautiful\"\ninclined to be a little monotonous, Miss Winchelsea thought. She had\nbeen quite glad when the last sunny Alp had vanished, because of the\nstaccato of Fanny's admiration. Helen said little, but Miss Winchelsea\nhad found her a little wanting on the aesthetic side in the old days and\nwas not surprised; sometimes she laughed at the young man's hesitating\ndelicate little jests and sometimes she didn't, and sometimes she seemed\nquite lost to the art about them in the contemplation of the dresses of\nthe other visitors.\n\nAt Rome the young man was with them intermittently. A rather \"touristy\"\nfriend of his took him away at times. He complained comically to Miss\nWinchelsea. \"I have only two short weeks in Rome,\" he said, \"and my\nfriend Leonard wants to spend a whole day at Tivoli, looking at a\nwaterfall.\"\n\n\"What is your friend Leonard?\" asked Miss Winchelsea abruptly.\n\n\"He's the most enthusiastic pedestrian I ever met,\" the young man\nreplied, amusingly, but a little unsatisfactorily, Miss Winchelsea\nthought. They had some glorious times, and Fanny could not think what\nthey would have done without him. Miss Winchelsea's interest and\nFanny's enormous capacity for admiration were insatiable. They never\nflagged--through pictures and sculpture galleries, immense crowded\nchurches, ruins and museums, Judas trees and prickly pears, wine carts\nand palaces, they admired their way unflinchingly. They never saw a\nstone pine or a eucalyptus but they named and admired it; they never\nglimpsed Soracte but they exclaimed. Their common ways were made\nwonderful by imaginative play. \"Here Caesar may have walked,\" they would\nsay. \"Raphael may have seen Soracte from this very point.\" They happened\non the tomb of Bibulus. \"Old Bibulus,\" said the young man. \"The oldest\nmonument of Republican Rome!\" said Miss Winchelsea.\n\n\"I'm dreadfully stupid,\" said Fanny, \"but who WAS Bibulus?\"\n\nThere was a curious little pause.\n\n\"Wasn't he the person who built the wall?\" said Helen.\n\nThe young man glanced quickly at her and laughed. \"That was Balbus,\" he\nsaid. Helen reddened, but neither he nor Miss Winchelsea threw any light\nupon Fanny's ignorance about Bibulus.\n\nHelen was more taciturn than the other three, but then she was always\ntaciturn, and usually she took care of the tram tickets and things like\nthat, or kept her eye on them if the young man took them, and told him\nwhere they were when he wanted them. Glorious times they had, these\nyoung people, in that pale brown cleanly city of memories that was once\nthe world. Their only sorrow was the shortness of the time. They said\nindeed that the electric trams and the '70 buildings, and that criminal\nadvertisement that glares upon the Forum, outraged their aesthetic\nfeelings unspeakably; but that was only part of the fun. And indeed Rome\nis such a wonderful place that it made Miss Winchelsea forget some\nof her most carefully prepared enthusiasms at times, and Helen, taken\nunawares, would suddenly admit the beauty of unexpected things. Yet\nFanny and Helen would have liked a shop window or so in the English\nquarter if Miss Winchelsea's uncompromising hostility to all other\nEnglish visitors had not rendered that district impossible.\n\nThe intellectual and aesthetic fellowship of Miss Winchelsea and the\nscholarly young man passed insensibly towards a deeper feeling.\nThe exuberant Fanny did her best to keep pace with their recondite\nadmiration by playing her \"beautiful,\" with vigour, and saying \"Oh!\nLET'S go,\" with enormous appetite whenever a new place of interest was\nmentioned. But Helen developed a certain want of sympathy towards the\nend, that disappointed Miss Winchelsea a little. She refused to \"see\nanything\" in the face of Beatrice Cenci--Shelley's Beatrice Cenci!--in\nthe Barberini gallery; and one day, when they were deploring the\nelectric trams, she said rather snappishly that \"people must get about\nsomehow, and it's better than torturing horses up these horrid little\nhills.\" She spoke of the Seven Hills of Rome as \"horrid little hills!\"\n\nAnd the day they went on the Palatine--though Miss Winchelsea did not\nknow of this--she remarked suddenly to Fanny, \"Don't hurry like that,\nmy dear; THEY don't want us to overtake them. And we don't say the right\nthings for them when we DO get near.\"\n\n\"I wasn't trying to overtake them,\" said Fanny, slackening her excessive\npace; \"I wasn't indeed.\" And for a minute she was short of breath.\n\nBut Miss Winchelsea had come upon happiness. It was only when she came\nto look back across an intervening tragedy that she quite realised\nhow happy she had been, pacing among the cypress-shadowed ruins, and\nexchanging the very highest class of information the human mind\ncan possess, the most refined impressions it is possible to convey.\nInsensibly emotion crept into their intercourse, sunning itself\nopenly and pleasantly at last when Helen's modernity was not too near.\nInsensibly their interest drifted from the wonderful associations about\nthem to their more intimate and personal feelings. In a tentative way\ninformation was supplied; she spoke allusively of her school, of her\nexamination successes, of her gladness that the days of \"Cram\" were\nover. He made it quite clear that he also was a teacher. They spoke of\nthe greatness of their calling, of the necessity of sympathy to face its\nirksome details, of a certain loneliness they sometimes felt.\n\nThat was in the Colosseum, and it was as far as they got that day,\nbecause Helen returned with Fanny--she had taken her into the upper\ngalleries. Yet the private dreams of Miss Winchelsea, already vivid and\nconcrete enough, became now realistic in the highest degree. She figured\nthat pleasant young man, lecturing in the most edifying way to his\nstudents, herself modestly prominent as his intellectual mate and\nhelper; she figured a refined little home, with two bureaus, with white\nshelves of high-class books, and autotypes of the pictures of Rossetti\nand Burne-Jones, with Morris's wall papers and flowers in pots of beaten\ncopper. Indeed she figured many things. On the Pincio the two had a few\nprecious moments together, while Helen marched Fanny off to see the muro\nTorto, and he spoke at once plainly. He said he hoped their friendship\nwas only beginning, that he already found her company very precious to\nhim, that indeed it was more than that.\n\nHe became nervous, thrusting at his glasses with trembling fingers as\nthough he fancied his emotions made them unstable. \"I should of course,\"\nhe said, \"tell you things about myself. I know it is rather unusual my\nspeaking to you like this. Only our meeting has been so accidental--or\nprovidential--and I am snatching at things. I came to Rome expecting\na lonely tour... and I have been so very happy, so very happy. Quite\nrecently I found myself in a position--I have dared to think--. And--\"\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder and stopped. He said \"Damn!\" quite\ndistinctly--and she did not condemn him for that manly lapse into\nprofanity. She looked and saw his friend Leonard advancing. He drew\nnearer; he raised his hat to Miss Winchelsea, and his smile was almost\na grin. \"I've been looking for you everywhere, Snooks,\" he said. \"You\npromised to be on the Piazza steps half an hour ago.\"\n\nSnooks! The name struck Miss Winchelsea like a blow in the face. She\ndid not hear his reply. She thought afterwards that Leonard must have\nconsidered her the vaguest-minded person. To this day she is not sure\nwhether she was introduced to Leonard or not, nor what she said to\nhim. A sort of mental paralysis was upon her. Of all offensive\nsurnames--Snooks!\n\nHelen and Fanny were returning, there were civilities, and the young\nmen were receding. By a great effort she controlled herself to face the\nenquiring eyes of her friends. All that afternoon she lived the life\nof a heroine under the indescribable outrage of that name, chatting,\nobserving, with \"Snooks\" gnawing at her heart. From the moment that it\nfirst rang upon her ears, the dream of her happiness was prostrate in\nthe dust. All the refinement she had figured was ruined and defaced by\nthat cognomen's unavoidable vulgarity.\n\nWhat was that refined little home to her now, spite of autotypes, Morris\npapers, and bureaus? Athwart it in letters of fire ran an incredible\ninscription: \"Mrs. Snooks.\" That may seem a little thing to the reader,\nbut consider the delicate refinement of Miss Winchelsea's mind. Be as\nrefined as you can and then think of writing yourself down:--\"Snooks.\"\nShe conceived herself being addressed as Mrs. Snooks by all the people\nshe liked least, conceived the patronymic touched with a vague quality\nof insult. She figured a card of grey and silver bearing \"Winchelsea,\"\ntriumphantly effaced by an arrow, Cupid's arrow, in favour of \"Snooks.\"\nDegrading confession of feminine weakness! She imagined the terrible\nrejoicings of certain girl friends, of certain grocer cousins from whom\nher growing refinement had long since estranged her. How they would\nmake it sprawl across the envelope that would bring their sarcastic\ncongratulations. Would even his pleasant company compensate her for\nthat? \"It is impossible,\" she muttered; \"impossible! SNOOKS!\"\n\nShe was sorry for him, but not so sorry as she was for herself. For him\nshe had a touch of indignation. To be so nice, so refined, while all the\ntime he was \"Snooks,\" to hide under a pretentious gentility of demeanour\nthe badge sinister of his surname seemed a sort of treachery. To put it\nin the language of sentimental science she felt he had \"led her on.\"\n\nThere were of course moments of terrible vacillation, a period even when\nsomething almost like passion bid her throw refinement to the winds. And\nthere was something in her, an unexpurgated vestige of vulgarity, that\nmade a strenuous attempt at proving that Snooks was not so very bad a\nname after all. Any hovering hesitation flew before Fanny's manner, when\nFanny came with an air of catastrophe to tell that she also knew the\nhorror. Fanny's voice fell to a whisper when she said SNOOKS. Miss\nWinchelsea would not give him any answer when at last, in the Borghese,\nshe could have a minute with him; but she promised him a note.\n\nShe handed him that note in the little book of poetry he had lent her,\nthe little book that had first drawn them together. Her refusal was\nambiguous, allusive. She could no more tell him why she rejected\nhim than she could have told a cripple of his hump. He too must feel\nsomething of the unspeakable quality of his name. Indeed he had avoided\na dozen chances of telling it, she now perceived. So she spoke of\n\"obstacles she could not reveal\"--\"reasons why the thing he spoke of was\nimpossible.\" She addressed the note with a shiver, \"E. K. Snooks.\"\n\nThings were worse than she had dreaded; he asked her to explain. How\nCOULD she explain? Those last two days in Rome were dreadful. She was\nhaunted by his air of astonished perplexity. She knew she had given him\nintimate hopes, she had not the courage to examine her mind thoroughly\nfor the extent of her encouragement. She knew he must think her the most\nchangeable of beings. Now that she was in full retreat, she would not\neven perceive his hints of a possible correspondence. But in that matter\nhe did a thing that seemed to her at once delicate and romantic. He made\na go-between of Fanny. Fanny could not keep the secret, and came and\ntold her that night under a transparent pretext of needed advice. \"Mr.\nSnooks,\" said Fanny, \"wants to write to me. Fancy! I had no idea. But\nshould I let him?\" They talked it over long and earnestly, and Miss\nWinchelsea was careful to keep the veil over her heart. She was\nalready repenting his disregarded hints. Why should she not hear of\nhim sometimes--painful though his name must be to her? Miss Winchelsea\ndecided it might be permitted, and Fanny kissed her good-night with\nunusual emotion. After she had gone Miss Winchelsea sat for a long time\nat the window of her little room. It was moonlight, and down the street\na man sang \"Santa Lucia\" with almost heart-dissolving tenderness.... She\nsat very still.\n\nShe breathed a word very softly to herself. The word was \"SNOOKS.\" Then\nshe got up with a profound sigh, and went to bed. The next morning he\nsaid to her meaningly, \"I shall hear of you through your friend.\"\n\nMr. Snooks saw them off from Rome with that pathetic interrogative\nperplexity still on his face, and if it had not been for Helen he\nwould have retained Miss Winchelsea's hold-all in his hand as a sort of\nencyclopaedic keepsake. On their way back to England Miss Winchelsea on\nsix separate occasions made Fanny promise to write to her the longest of\nlong letters. Fanny, it seemed, would be quite near Mr. Snooks. Her new\nschool--she was always going to new schools--would be only five miles\nfrom Steely Bank, and it was in the Steely Bank Polytechnic, and one or\ntwo first-class schools, that Mr. Snooks did his teaching. He might even\nsee her at times. They could not talk much of him--she and Fanny always\nspoke of \"him,\" never of Mr. Snooks,--because Helen was apt to say\nunsympathetic things about him. Her nature had coarsened very much,\nMiss Winchelsea perceived, since the old Training College days; she\nhad become hard and cynical. She thought he had a weak face, mistaking\nrefinement for weakness as people of her stamp are apt to do, and when\nshe heard his name was Snooks, she said she had expected something of\nthe sort. Miss Winchelsea was careful to spare her own feelings after\nthat, but Fanny was less circumspect.\n\nThe girls parted in London, and Miss Winchelsea returned, with a new\ninterest in life, to the Girls' High School in which she had been\nan increasingly valuable assistant for the last three years. Her new\ninterest in life was Fanny as a correspondent, and to give her a lead\nshe wrote her a lengthy descriptive letter within a fortnight of her\nreturn. Fanny answered, very disappointingly. Fanny indeed had no\nliterary gift, but it was new to Miss Winchelsea to find herself\ndeploring the want of gifts in a friend. That letter was even criticised\naloud in the safe solitude of Miss Winchelsea's study, and her\ncriticism, spoken with great bitterness, was \"Twaddle!\" It was full of\njust the things Miss Winchelsea's letter had been full of, particulars\nof the school. And of Mr. Snooks, only this much: \"I have had a\nletter from Mr. Snooks, and he has been over to see me on two Saturday\nafternoons running. He talked about Rome and you; we both talked about\nyou. Your ears must have burnt, my dear....\"\n\nMiss Winchelsea repressed a desire to demand more explicit information,\nand wrote the sweetest long letter again. \"Tell me all about yourself,\ndear. That journey has quite refreshed our ancient friendship, and I do\nso want to keep in touch with you.\" About Mr. Snooks she simply wrote\non the fifth page that she was glad Fanny had seen him, and that if\nhe SHOULD ask after her, she was to be remembered to him VERY KINDLY\n(underlined). And Fanny replied most obtusely in the key of that\n\"ancient friendship,\" reminding Miss Winchelsea of a dozen foolish\nthings of those old schoolgirl days at the training college, and saying\nnot a word about Mr. Snooks!\n\nFor nearly a week Miss Winchelsea was so angry at the failure of Fanny\nas a go-between that she could not write to her. And then she wrote less\neffusively, and in her letter she asked point-blank, \"Have you seen Mr.\nSnooks?\" Fanny's letter was unexpectedly satisfactory. \"I HAVE seen Mr.\nSnooks,\" she wrote, and having once named him she kept on about him;\nit was all Snooks--Snooks this and Snooks that. He was to give a public\nlecture, said Fanny, among other things. Yet Miss Winchelsea, after\nthe first glow of gratification, still found this letter a little\nunsatisfactory. Fanny did not report Mr. Snooks as saying anything about\nMiss Winchelsea, nor as looking a little white and worn, as he ought\nto have been doing. And behold! before she had replied, came a second\nletter from Fanny on the same theme, quite a gushing letter, and\ncovering six sheets with her loose feminine hand.\n\nAnd about this second letter was a rather odd little thing that Miss\nWinchelsea only noticed as she re-read it the third time. Fanny's\nnatural femininity had prevailed even against the round and clear\ntraditions of the training college; she was one of those she-creatures\nborn to make all her m's and n's and u's and r's and e's alike, and to\nleave her o's and a's open and her i's undotted. So that it was only\nafter an elaborate comparison of word with word that Miss Winchelsea\nfelt assured Mr. Snooks was not really \"Mr. Snooks\" at all! In Fanny's\nfirst letter of gush he was Mr. \"Snooks,\" in her second the spelling was\nchanged to Mr. \"Senoks.\" Miss Winchelsea's hand positively trembled as\nshe turned the sheet over--it meant so much to her. For it had already\nbegun to seem to her that even the name of Mrs. Snooks might be avoided\nat too great a price, and suddenly--this possibility! She turned over\nthe six sheets, all dappled with that critical name, and everywhere the\nfirst letter had the form of an E! For a time she walked the room with a\nhand pressed upon her heart.\n\nShe spent a whole day pondering this change, weighing a letter of\ninquiry that should be at once discreet and effectual, weighing too what\naction she should take after the answer came. She was resolved that if\nthis altered spelling was anything more than a quaint fancy of Fanny's,\nshe would write forthwith to Mr. Snooks. She had now reached a stage\nwhen the minor refinements of behaviour disappear. Her excuse remained\nuninvented, but she had the subject of her letter clear in her mind,\neven to the hint that \"circumstances in my life have changed very\ngreatly since we talked together.\" But she never gave that hint. There\ncame a third letter from that fitful correspondent Fanny. The first line\nproclaimed her \"the happiest girl alive.\"\n\nMiss Winchelsea crushed the letter in her hand--the rest unread--and\nsat with her face suddenly very still. She had received it just before\nmorning school, and had opened it when the junior mathematicians were\nwell under way. Presently she resumed reading with an appearance of\ngreat calm. But after the first sheet she went on reading the third\nwithout discovering the error:--\"told him frankly I did not like\nhis name,\" the third sheet began. \"He told me he did not like it\nhimself--you know that sort of sudden frank way he has\"--Miss Winchelsea\ndid know. \"So I said 'Couldn't you change it?' He didn't see it at\nfirst. Well, you know, dear, he had told me what it really meant; it\nmeans Sevenoaks, only it has got down to Snooks--both Snooks and Noaks,\ndreadfully vulgar surnames though they be, are really worn forms of\nSevenoaks. So I said--even I have my bright ideas at times--'if it\ngot down from Sevenoaks to Snooks, why not get it back from Snooks\nto Sevenoaks?' And the long and the short of it is, dear, he couldn't\nrefuse me, and he changed his spelling there and then to Senoks for the\nbills of the new lecture. And afterwards, when we are married, we shall\nput in the apostrophe and make it Se'noks. Wasn't it kind of him to mind\nthat fancy of mine, when many men would have taken offence? But it is\njust like him all over; he is as kind as he is clever. Because he knew\nas well as I did that I would have had him in spite of it, had he been\nten times Snooks. But he did it all the same.\"\n\nThe class was startled by the sound of paper being viciously torn, and\nlooked up to see Miss Winchelsea white in the face, and with some very\nsmall pieces of paper clenched in one hand. For a few seconds they\nstared at her stare, and then her expression changed back to a more\nfamiliar one. \"Has any one finished number three?\" she asked in an even\ntone. She remained calm after that. But impositions ruled high that day.\nAnd she spent two laborious evenings writing letters of various sorts\nto Fanny, before she found a decent congratulatory vein. Her reason\nstruggled hopelessly against the persuasion that Fanny had behaved in an\nexceedingly treacherous manner.\n\nOne may be extremely refined and still capable of a very sore heart.\nCertainly Miss Winchelsea's heart was very sore. She had moods of sexual\nhostility, in which she generalised uncharitably about mankind. \"He\nforgot himself with me,\" she said. \"But Fanny is pink and pretty and\nsoft and a fool--a very excellent match for a Man.\" And by way of a\nwedding present she sent Fanny a gracefully bound volume of poetry by\nGeorge Meredith, and Fanny wrote back a grossly happy letter to say that\nit was \"ALL beautiful.\" Miss Winchelsea hoped that some day Mr. Senoks\nmight take up that slim book and think for a moment of the donor. Fanny\nwrote several times before and about her marriage, pursuing that fond\nlegend of their \"ancient friendship,\" and giving her happiness in the\nfullest detail. And Miss Winchelsea wrote to Helen for the first\ntime after the Roman journey, saying nothing about the marriage, but\nexpressing very cordial feelings.\n\nThey had been in Rome at Easter, and Fanny was married in the August\nvacation. She wrote a garrulous letter to Miss Winchelsea, describing\nher home-coming, and the astonishing arrangements of their \"teeny weeny\"\nlittle house. Mr. Se'noks was now beginning to assume a refinement in\nMiss Winchelsea's memory out of all proportion to the facts of the case,\nand she tried in vain to imagine his cultured greatness in a \"teeny\nweeny\" little house. \"Am busy enamelling a cosey corner,\" said Fanny,\nsprawling to the end of her third sheet, \"so excuse more.\" Miss\nWinchelsea answered in her best style, gently poking fun at Fanny's\narrangements and hoping intensely that Mr. Sen'oks might see the letter.\nOnly this hope enabled her to write at all, answering not only that\nletter but one in November and one at Christmas.\n\nThe two latter communications contained urgent invitations for her to\ncome to Steely Bank on a Visit during the Christmas holidays. She tried\nto think that HE had told her to ask that, but it was too much like\nFanny's opulent good-nature. She could not but believe that he must be\nsick of his blunder by this time; and she had more than a hope that he\nwould presently write her a letter beginning \"Dear Friend.\" Something\nsubtly tragic in the separation was a great support to her, a sad\nmisunderstanding. To have been jilted would have been intolerable. But\nhe never wrote that letter beginning \"Dear Friend.\"\n\nFor two years Miss Winchelsea could not go to see her friends, in\nspite of the reiterated invitations of Mrs. Sevenoaks--it became full\nSevenoaks in the second year. Then one day near the Easter rest she felt\nlonely and without a soul to understand her in the world, and her mind\nran once more on what is called Platonic friendship. Fanny was clearly\nhappy and busy in her new sphere of domesticity, but no doubt HE had his\nlonely hours. Did he ever think of those days in Rome--gone now beyond\nrecalling? No one had understood her as he had done; no one in all the\nworld. It would be a sort of melancholy pleasure to talk to him again,\nand what harm could it do? Why should she deny herself? That night she\nwrote a sonnet, all but the last two lines of the octave--which would\nnot come, and the next day she composed a graceful little note to tell\nFanny she was coming down.\n\nAnd so she saw him again.\n\nEven at the first encounter it was evident he had changed; he seemed\nstouter and less nervous, and it speedily appeared that his conversation\nhad already lost much of its old delicacy. There even seemed a\njustification for Helen's description of weakness in his face--in\ncertain lights it WAS weak. He seemed busy and preoccupied about his\naffairs, and almost under the impression that Miss Winchelsea had\ncome for the sake of Fanny. He discussed his dinner with Fanny in an\nintelligent way. They only had one good long talk together, and that\ncame to nothing. He did not refer to Rome, and spent some time abusing a\nman who had stolen an idea he had had for a text-book. It did not seem a\nvery wonderful idea to Miss Winchelsea. She discovered he had forgotten\nthe names of more than half the painters whose work they had rejoiced\nover in Florence.\n\nIt was a sadly disappointing week, and Miss Winchelsea was glad when it\ncame to an end. Under various excuses she avoided visiting them again.\nAfter a time the visitor's room was occupied by their two little boys,\nand Fanny's invitations ceased. The intimacy of her letters had long\nsince faded away.\n\n\n\n\n13. A DREAM OF ARMAGEDDON\n\nThe man with the white face entered the carriage at Rugby. He moved\nslowly in spite of the urgency of his porter, and even while he was\nstill on the platform I noted how ill he seemed. He dropped into the\ncorner over against me with a sigh, made an incomplete attempt to\narrange his travelling shawl, and became motionless, with his eyes\nstaring vacantly. Presently he was moved by a sense of my observation,\nlooked up at me, and put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper. Then\nhe glanced again in my direction.\n\nI feigned to read. I feared I had unwittingly embarrassed him, and in a\nmoment I was surprised to find him speaking.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said I.\n\n\"That book,\" he repeated, pointing a lean finger, \"is about dreams.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" I answered, for it was Fortnum-Roscoe's Dream States, and\nthe title was on the cover. He hung silent for a space as if he sought\nwords. \"Yes,\" he said at last, \"but they tell you nothing.\" I did not\ncatch his meaning for a second.\n\n\"They don't know,\" he added.\n\nI looked a little more attentively at his face.\n\n\"There are dreams,\" he said, \"and dreams.\"\n\nThat sort of proposition I never dispute.\n\n\"I suppose--\" he hesitated. \"Do you ever dream? I mean vividly.\"\n\n\"I dream very little,\" I answered. \"I doubt if I have three vivid dreams\nin a year.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts.\n\n\"Your dreams don't mix with your memories?\" he asked abruptly. \"You\ndon't find yourself in doubt; did this happen or did it not?\"\n\n\"Hardly ever. Except just for a momentary hesitation now and then. I\nsuppose few people do.\"\n\n\"Does HE say--\" he indicated the book.\n\n\"Says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about\nintensity of impression and the like to account for its not happening as\na rule. I suppose you know something of these theories--\"\n\n\"Very little--except that they are wrong.\"\n\nHis emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time. I\nprepared to resume reading, and that seemed to precipitate his next\nremark. He leant forward almost as though he would touch me.\n\n\"Isn't there something called consecutive dreaming--that goes on night\nafter night?\"\n\n\"I believe there is. There are cases given in most books on mental\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Mental trouble! Yes. I dare say there are. It's the right place for\nthem. But what I mean--\" He looked at his bony knuckles. \"Is that sort\nof thing always dreaming? IS it dreaming? Or is it something else?\nMightn't it be something else?\"\n\nI should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn\nanxiety of his face. I remember now the look of his faded eyes and the\nlids red-stained--perhaps you know that look.\n\n\"I'm not just arguing about a matter of opinion,\" he said. \"The thing's\nkilling me.\"\n\n\"Dreams?\"\n\n\"If you call them dreams. Night after night. Vivid!--so vivid... this--\"\n(he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window) \"seems\nunreal in comparison! I can scarcely remember who I am, what business I\nam on....\"\n\nHe paused. \"Even now--\"\n\n\"The dream is always the same--do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's over.\"\n\n\"You mean?\"\n\n\"I died.\"\n\n\"Died?\"\n\n\"Smashed and killed, and now, so much of me as that dream was, is\ndead. Dead for ever. I dreamt I was another man, you know, living in a\ndifferent part of the world and in a different time. I dreamt that night\nafter night. Night after night I woke into that other life. Fresh scenes\nand fresh happenings--until I came upon the last--\"\n\n\"When you died?\"\n\n\"When I died.\"\n\n\"And since then--\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Thank God! That was the end of the dream....\"\n\nIt was clear I was in for this dream. And after all, I had an hour\nbefore me, the light was fading fast, and Fortnum-Roscoe has a dreary\nway with him. \"Living in a different time,\" I said: \"do you mean in some\ndifferent age?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Past?\"\n\n\"No, to come--to come.\"\n\n\"The year three thousand, for example?\"\n\n\"I don't know what year it was. I did when I was asleep, when I was\ndreaming, that is, but not now--not now that I am awake. There's a lot\nof things I have forgotten since I woke out of these dreams, though I\nknew them at the time when I was--I suppose it was dreaming. They called\nthe year differently from our way of calling the year.... What DID they\ncall it?\" He put his hand to his forehead. \"No,\" said he, \"I forget.\"\n\nHe sat smiling weakly. For a moment I feared he did not mean to tell\nme his dream. As a rule I hate people who tell their dreams, but this\nstruck me differently. I proffered assistance even. \"It began--\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"It was vivid from the first. I seemed to wake up in it suddenly. And\nit's curious that in these dreams I am speaking of I never remembered\nthis life I am living now. It seemed as if the dream life was enough\nwhile it lasted. Perhaps--But I will tell you how I find myself when I\ndo my best to recall it all. I don't remember anything dearly until I\nfound myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea. I\nhad been dozing, and suddenly I woke up--fresh and vivid--not a bit\ndream-like--because the girl had stopped fanning me.\"\n\n\"The girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, the girl. You must not interrupt or you will put me out.\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly. \"You won't think I'm mad?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" I answered; \"you've been dreaming. Tell me your dream.\"\n\n\"I woke up, I say, because the girl had stopped fanning me. I was not\nsurprised to find myself there or anything of that sort, you understand.\nI did not feel I had fallen into it suddenly. I simply took it up at\nthat point. Whatever memory I had of THIS life, this nineteenth-century\nlife, faded as I woke, vanished like a dream. I knew all about myself,\nknew that my name was no longer Cooper but Hedon, and all about my\nposition in the world. I've forgotten a lot since I woke--there's a want\nof connection--but it was all quite clear and matter of fact then.\"\n\nHe hesitated again, gripping the window strap, putting his face forward\nand looking up at me appealingly.\n\n\"This seems bosh to you?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" I cried. \"Go on. Tell me what this loggia was like.\"\n\n\"It was not really a loggia--I don't know what to call it. It faced\nsouth. It was small. It was all in shadow except the semicircle above\nthe balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the\ngirl stood. I was on a couch--it was a metal couch with light striped\ncushions-and the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me.\nThe light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek. Her pretty white\nneck and the little curls that nestled there, and her white shoulder\nwere in the sun, and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue\nshadow. She was dressed--how can I describe it? It was easy and flowing.\nAnd altogether there she stood, so that it came to me how beautiful and\ndesirable she was, as though I had never seen her before. And when at\nlast I sighed and raised myself upon my arm she turned her face to me--\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"I have lived three-and-fifty years in this world. I have had mother,\nsisters, friends, wife, and daughters--all their faces, the play of\ntheir faces, I know. But the face of this girl--it is much more real to\nme. I can bring it back into memory so that I see it again--I could draw\nit or paint it. And after all--\"\n\nHe stopped--but I said nothing.\n\n\"The face of a dream--the face of a dream. She was beautiful. Not that\nbeauty which is terrible, cold, and worshipful, like the beauty of\na saint; nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions; but a sort of\nradiation, sweet lips that softened into smiles, and grave grey eyes.\nAnd she moved gracefully, she seemed to have part with all pleasant and\ngracious things--\"\n\nHe stopped, and his face was downcast and hidden. Then he looked up\nat me and went on, making no further attempt to disguise his absolute\nbelief in the reality of his story.\n\n\"You see, I had thrown up my plans and ambitions, thrown up all I had\never worked for or desired for her sake. I had been a master man away\nthere in the north, with influence and property and a great reputation,\nbut none of it had seemed worth having beside her. I had come to the\nplace, this city of sunny pleasures, with her, and left all those things\nto wreck and ruin just to save a remnant at least of my life. While I\nhad been in love with her before I knew that she had any care for me,\nbefore I had imagined that she would dare--that we should dare, all my\nlife had seemed vain and hollow, dust and ashes. It WAS dust and ashes.\nNight after night and through the long days I had longed and desired--my\nsoul had beaten against the thing forbidden!\n\n\"But it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things.\nIt's emotion, it's a tint, a light that comes and goes. Only while it's\nthere, everything changes, everything. The thing is I came away and left\nthem in their Crisis to do what they could.\"\n\n\"Left whom?\" I asked, puzzled.\n\n\"The people up in the north there. You see--in this dream, anyhow--I\nhad been a big man, the sort of man men come to trust in, to group\nthemselves about. Millions of men who had never seen me were ready to\ndo things and risk things because of their confidence in me. I had\nbeen playing that game for years, that big laborious game, that vague,\nmonstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals, speech and\nagitation. It was a vast weltering world, and at last I had a sort of\nleadership against the Gang--you know it was called the Gang--a sort of\ncompromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public\nemotional stupidities and catchwords--the Gang that kept the world noisy\nand blind year by year, and all the while that it was drifting, drifting\ntowards infinite disaster. But I can't expect you to understand the\nshades and complications of the year--the year something or other ahead.\nI had it all down to the smallest details--in my dream. I suppose I had\nbeen dreaming of it before I awoke, and the fading outline of some queer\nnew development I had imagined still hung about me as I rubbed my eyes.\nIt was some grubby affair that made me thank God for the sunlight. I\nsat up on the couch and remained looking at the woman and\nrejoicing--rejoicing that I had come away out of all that tumult and\nfolly and violence before it was too late. After all, I thought, this is\nlife--love and beauty, desire and delight, are they not worth all those\ndismal struggles for vague, gigantic ends? And I blamed myself for\nhaving ever sought to be a leader when I might have given my days to\nlove. But then, thought I, if I had not spent my early days sternly and\nausterely, I might have wasted myself upon vain and worthless women, and\nat the thought all my being went out in love and tenderness to my dear\nmistress, my dear lady, who had come at last and compelled me--compelled\nme by her invincible charm for me--to lay that life aside.\n\n\"'You are worth it,' I said, speaking without intending her to hear;\n'you are worth it, my dearest one; worth pride and praise and all\nthings. Love! to have YOU is worth them all together.' And at the murmur\nof my voice she turned about.\n\n\"'Come and see,' she cried--I can hear her now--'come and see the\nsunrise upon Monte Solaro.'\n\n\"I remember how I sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony. She\nput a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of\nlimestone, flushing, as it were, into life. I looked. But first I noted\nthe sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck. How\ncan I describe to you the scene we had before us? We were at Capri--\"\n\n\"I have been there,\" I said. \"I have clambered up Monte Solaro and drunk\nvero Capri--muddy stuff like cider--at the summit.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the man with the white face; \"then perhaps you can tell\nme--you will know if this was indeed Capri. For in this life I have\nnever been there. Let me describe it. We were in a little room, one of a\nvast multitude of little rooms, very cool and sunny, hollowed out of the\nlimestone of a sort of cape, very high above the sea. The whole island,\nyou know, was one enormous hotel, complex beyond explaining, and on the\nother side there were miles of floating hotels, and huge floating stages\nto which the flying machines came. They called it a pleasure city. Of\ncourse, there was none of that in your time rather, I should say, IS\nnone of that NOW. Of course. Now!--yes.\n\n\"Well, this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape, so that one\ncould see east and west. Eastward was a great cliff--a thousand feet\nhigh perhaps--coldly grey except for one bright edge of gold, and beyond\nit the Isle of the Sirens, and a falling coast that faded and passed\ninto the hot sunrise. And when one turned to the west, distinct and near\nwas a little bay, a little beach still in shadow. And out of that shadow\nrose Solaro straight and tall, flushed and golden crested, like a beauty\nthroned, and the white moon was floating behind her in the sky. And\nbefore us from east to west stretched the many-tinted sea all dotted\nwith little sailing boats.\n\n\"To the eastward, of course, these little boats were grey and very\nminute and clear, but to the westward they were little boats of\ngold--shining gold--almost like little flames. And just below us was a\nrock with an arch worn through it. The blue sea-water broke to green and\nfoam all round the rock, and a galley came gliding out of the arch.\"\n\n\"I know that rock,\" I said. \"I was nearly drowned there. It is called\nthe Faraglioni.\"\n\n\"I Faraglioni? Yes, she called it that,\" answered the man with the white\nface. \"There was some story--but that--\"\n\nHe put his hand to his forehead again. \"No,\" he said, \"I forget that\nstory.\"\n\n\"Well, that is the first thing I remember, the first dream I had, that\nlittle shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of\nmine, with her shining arms and her graceful robe, and how we sat\nand talked in half whispers to one another. We talked in whispers not\nbecause there was any one to hear, but because there was still such a\nfreshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened,\nI think, to find themselves at last in words. And so they went softly.\n\n\"Presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment, going by\na strange passage with a moving floor, until we came to the great\nbreakfast room--there was a fountain and music. A pleasant and joyful\nplace it was, with its sunlight and splashing, and the murmur of plucked\nstrings. And we sat and ate and smiled at one another, and I would not\nheed a man who was watching me from a table near by.\n\n\"And afterwards we went on to the dancing-hall. But I cannot describe\nthat hall. The place was enormous--larger than any building you have\never seen--and in one place there was the old gate of Capri, caught into\nthe wall of a gallery high overhead. Light girders, stems and threads\nof gold, burst from the pillars like fountains, streamed like an Aurora\nacross the roof and interlaced, like--like conjuring tricks. All about\nthe great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures, strange\ndragons, and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights. The\nplace was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day.\nAnd as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at\nus, for all through the world my name and face were known, and how I had\nsuddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place. And they\nlooked also at the lady beside me, though half the story of how at last\nshe had come to me was unknown or mistold. And few of the men who were\nthere, I know, but judged me a happy man, in spite of all the shame and\ndishonour that had come upon my name.\n\n\"The air was full of music, full of harmonious scents, full of the\nrhythm of beautiful motions. Thousands of beautiful people swarmed about\nthe hall, crowded the galleries, sat in a myriad recesses; they were\ndressed in splendid colours and crowned with flowers; thousands danced\nabout the great circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods, and\nglorious processions of youths and maidens came and went. We two danced,\nnot the dreary monotonies of your days--of this time, I mean--but\ndances that were beautiful, intoxicating. And even now I can see my lady\ndancing--dancing joyously. She danced, you know, with a serious face;\nshe danced with a serious dignity, and yet she was smiling at me and\ncaressing me--smiling and caressing with her eyes.\n\n\"The music was different,\" he murmured. \"It went--I cannot describe it;\nbut it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has\never come to me awake.\n\n\"And then--it was when we had done dancing--a man came to speak to\nme. He was a lean, resolute man, very soberly clad for that place, and\nalready I had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall, and\nafterwards as we went along the passage I had avoided his eye. But now,\nas we sat in a little alcove, smiling at the pleasure of all the people\nwho went to and fro across the shining floor, he came and touched me,\nand spoke to me so that I was forced to listen. And he asked that he\nmight speak to me for a little time apart.\n\n\"'No,' I said. 'I have no secrets from this lady. What do you want to\ntell me?'\n\n\"He said it was a trivial matter, or at least a dry matter, for a lady\nto hear.\n\n\"'Perhaps for me to hear,' said I.\n\n\"He glanced at her, as though almost he would appeal to her. Then he\nasked me suddenly if I had heard of a great and avenging declaration\nthat Evesham had made. Now, Evesham had always before been the man next\nto myself in the leadership of that great party in the north. He was a\nforcible, hard and tactless man, and only I had been able to control and\nsoften him. It was on his account even more than my own, I think, that\nthe others had been so dismayed at my retreat. So this question about\nwhat he had done reawakened my old interest in the life I had put aside\njust for a moment.\n\n\"'I have taken no heed of any news for many days,' I said. 'What has\nEvesham been saying?'\n\n\"And with that the man began, nothing loath, and I must confess even I\nwas struck by Evesham's reckless folly in the wild and threatening words\nhe had used. And this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of\nEvesham's speech, but went on to ask counsel and to point out what\nneed they had of me. While he talked, my lady sat a little forward and\nwatched his face and mine.\n\n\"My old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves. I could\neven see myself suddenly returning to the north, and all the dramatic\neffect of it. All that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the\nparty indeed, but not to its damage. I should go back stronger than I\nhad come. And then I thought of my lady. You see--how can I tell you?\nThere were certain peculiarities of our relationship--as things are I\nneed not tell you about that--which would render her presence with me\nimpossible. I should have had to leave her; indeed, I should have had to\nrenounce her clearly and openly, if I was to do all that I could do in\nthe north. And the man knew THAT, even as he talked to her and me, knew\nit as well as she did, that my steps to duty were--first, separation,\nthen abandonment. At the touch of that thought my dream of a return\nwas shattered. I turned on the man suddenly, as he was imagining his\neloquence was gaining ground with me.\n\n\"'What have I to do with these things now?' I said. 'I have done with\nthem. Do you think I am coquetting with your people in coming here?'\n\n\"'No,' he said; 'but--'\n\n\"'Why cannot you leave me alone? I have done with these things. I have\nceased to be anything but a private man.'\n\n\"'Yes,' he answered. 'But have you thought?--this talk of war, these\nreckless challenges, these wild aggressions--'\n\n\"I stood up.\n\n\"'No,' I cried. 'I won't hear you. I took count of all those things, I\nweighed them--and I have come away.'\n\n\"He seemed to consider the possibility of persistence. He looked from me\nto where the lady sat regarding us.\n\n\"'War,' he said, as if he were speaking to himself, and then turned\nslowly from me and walked away. I stood, caught in the whirl of thoughts\nhis appeal had set going.\n\n\"I heard my lady's voice.\n\n\"'Dear,' she said; 'but if they have need of you--'\n\n\"She did not finish her sentence, she let it rest there. I turned to her\nsweet face, and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled.\n\n\"'They want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves,' I\nsaid. 'If they distrust Evesham they must settle with him themselves.'\n\n\"She looked at me doubtfully.\n\n\"'But war--' she said.\n\n\"I saw a doubt on her face that I had seen before, a doubt of herself\nand me, the first shadow of the discovery that, seen strongly and\ncompletely, must drive us apart for ever.\n\n\"Now, I was an older mind than hers, and I could sway her to this belief\nor that.\n\n\"'My dear one,' I said, 'you must not trouble over these things. There\nwill be no war. Certainly there will be no war. The age of wars is past.\nTrust me to know the justice of this case. They have no right upon me,\ndearest, and no one has a right upon me. I have been free to choose my\nlife, and I have chosen this.'\n\n\"'But WAR--' she said.\n\n\"I sat down beside her. I put an arm behind her and took her hand in\nmine. I set myself to drive that doubt away--I set myself to fill her\nmind with pleasant things again. I lied to her, and in lying to her I\nlied also to myself. And she was only too ready to believe me, only too\nready to forget.\n\n\"Very soon the shadow had gone again, and we were hastening to our\nbathing-place in the Grotta del Bovo Marino, where it was our custom to\nbathe every day. We swam and splashed one another, and in that buoyant\nwater I seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man. And\nat last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks.\nAnd then I put on a dry bathing-dress, and we sat to bask in the sun,\nand presently I nodded, resting my head against her knee, and she put\nher hand upon my hair and stroked it softly and I dozed. And behold! as\nit were with the snapping of the string of a violin, I was awakening,\nand I was in my own bed in Liverpool, in the life of to-day.\n\n\"Only for a time I could not believe that all these vivid moments had\nbeen no more than the substance of a dream.\n\n\"In truth, I could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality\nof things about me. I bathed and dressed as it were by habit, and as I\nshaved I argued why I of all men should leave the woman I loved to go\nback to fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north. Even if\nEvesham did force the world back to war, what was that to me? I was a\nman, with the heart of a man, and why should I feel the responsibility\nof a deity for the way the world might go?\n\n\"You know that is not quite the way I think about affairs, about my real\naffairs. I am a solicitor, you know, with a point of view.\n\n\"The vision was so real, you must understand, so utterly unlike a dream\nthat I kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details; even the\nornament of a book-cover that lay on my wife's sewing-machine in the\nbreakfast-room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran\nabout the seat in the alcove where I had talked with the messenger from\nmy deserted party. Have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality\nlike that?\"\n\n\"Like--?\"\n\n\"So that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten.\"\n\nI thought. I had never noticed the point before, but he was right.\n\n\"Never,\" I said. \"That is what you never seem to do with dreams.\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"But that is just what I did. I am a solicitor, you\nmust understand, in Liverpool, and I could not help wondering what the\nclients and business people I found myself talking to in my office would\nthink if I told them suddenly I was in love with a girl who would\nbe born a couple of hundred years or so hence, and worried about the\npolitics of my great-great-great-grandchildren. I was chiefly busy that\nday negotiating a ninety-nine-year building lease. It was a private\nbuilder in a hurry, and we wanted to tie him in every possible way. I\nhad an interview with him, and he showed a certain want of temper that\nsent me to bed still irritated. That night I had no dream. Nor did I\ndream the next night, at least, to remember.\n\n\"Something of that intense reality of conviction vanished. I began to\nfeel sure it WAS a dream. And then it came again.\n\n\"When the dream came again, nearly four days later, it was very\ndifferent. I think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the\ndream. Many things had happened in the north, and the shadow of them was\nback again between us, and this time it was not so easily dispelled.\nI began, I know, with moody musings. Why, in spite of all, should I go\nback, go back for all the rest of my days to toil and stress, insults\nand perpetual dissatisfaction, simply to save hundreds of millions of\ncommon people, whom I did not love, whom too often I could do no other\nthan despise, from the stress and anguish of war and infinite misrule?\nAnd after all I might fail. THEY all sought their own narrow ends, and\nwhy should not I--why should not I also live as a man? And out of such\nthoughts her voice summoned me, and I lifted my eyes.\n\n\"I found myself awake and walking. We had come out above the Pleasure\nCity, we were near the summit of Monte Solaro and looking towards the\nbay. It was the late afternoon and very clear. Far away to the left\nIschia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky, and Naples was coldly\nwhite against the hills, and before us was Vesuvius with a tall and\nslender streamer feathering at last towards the south, and the ruins of\nTorre dell' Annunziata and Castellamare glittering and near.\"\n\nI interrupted suddenly: \"You have been to Capri, of course?\"\n\n\"Only in this dream,\" he said, \"only in this dream. All across the bay\nbeyond Sorrento were the floating palaces of the Pleasure City moored\nand chained. And northward were the broad floating stages that received\nthe aeroplanes. Aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon, each\nbringing its thousands of pleasure-seekers from the uttermost parts of\nthe earth to Capri and its delights. All these things, I say, stretched\nbelow.\n\n\"But we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that\nevening had to show. Five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered useless\nin the distant arsenals of the Rhinemouth were manoeuvring now in the\neastward sky. Evesham had astonished the world by producing them and\nothers, and sending them to circle here and there. It was the threat\nmaterial in the great game of bluff he was playing, and it had taken\neven me by surprise. He was one of those incredibly stupid energetic\npeople who seem sent by Heaven to create disasters. His energy to\nthe first glance seemed so wonderfully like capacity! But he had no\nimagination, no invention, only a stupid, vast, driving force of will,\nand a mad faith in his stupid idiot 'luck' to pull him through. I\nremember how we stood out upon the headland watching the squadron\ncircling far away, and how I weighed the full meaning of the sight,\nseeing clearly the way things must go. And then even it was not too\nlate. I might have gone back, I think, and saved the world. The people\nof the north would follow me, I knew, granted only that in one thing I\nrespected their moral standards. The east and south would trust me as\nthey would trust no other northern man. And I knew I had only to put it\nto her and she would have let me go.... Not because she did not love me!\n\n\"Only I did not want to go; my will was all the other way about. I had\nso newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility: I was still so fresh\na renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what I OUGHT to do\nhad no power at all to touch my will. My will was to live, to gather\npleasures and make my dear lady happy. But though this sense of vast\nneglected duties had no power to draw me, it could make me silent and\npreoccupied, it robbed the days I had spent of half their brightness and\nroused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night. And as I\nstood and watched Evesham's aeroplanes sweep to and fro--those birds\nof infinite ill omen--she stood beside me watching me, perceiving the\ntrouble indeed, but not perceiving it clearly her eyes questioning my\nface, her expression shaded with perplexity. Her face was grey because\nthe sunset was fading out of the sky. It was no fault of hers that she\nheld me. She had asked me to go from her, and again in the night time\nand with tears she had asked me to go.\n\n\"At last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood. I turned\nupon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes.\n'No,' she said, as if I jarred with her gravity, but I was resolved to\nend that gravity, and made her run--no one can be very grey and sad who\nis out of breath--and when she stumbled I ran with my hand beneath\nher arm. We ran down past a couple of men, who turned back staring in\nastonishment at my behaviour--they must have recognised my face.\nAnd halfway down the slope came a tumult in the air, clang-clank,\nclang-clank, and we stopped, and presently over the hill-crest those war\nthings came flying one behind the other.\"\n\nThe man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description.\n\n\"What were they like?\" I asked.\n\n\"They had never fought,\" he said. \"They were just like our ironclads are\nnowadays; they had never fought. No one knew what they might do, with\nexcited men inside them; few even cared to speculate. They were great\ndriving things shaped like spearheads without a shaft, with a propeller\nin the place of the shaft.\"\n\n\"Steel?\"\n\n\"Not steel.\"\n\n\"Aluminium?\"\n\n\"No, no, nothing of that sort. An alloy that was very common--as common\nas brass, for example. It was called--let me see--.\" He squeezed his\nforehead with the fingers of one hand. \"I am forgetting everything,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"And they carried guns?\"\n\n\"Little guns, firing high explosive shells. They fired the guns\nbackwards, out of the base of the leaf, so to speak, and rammed with the\nbeak. That was the theory, you know, but they had never been fought. No\none could tell exactly what was going to happen. And meanwhile I suppose\nit was very fine to go whirling through the air like a flight of young\nswallows, swift and easy. I guess the captains tried not to think\ntoo clearly what the real thing would be like. And these flying war\nmachines, you know, were only one sort of the endless war contrivances\nthat had been invented and had fallen into abeyance during the long\npeace. There were all sorts of these things that people were routing out\nand furbishing up; infernal things, silly things; things that had never\nbeen tried; big engines, terrible explosives, great guns. You know the\nsilly way of these ingenious sort of men who make these things; they\nturn 'em out as beavers build dams, and with no more sense of the rivers\nthey're going to divert and the lands they're going to flood!\n\n\"As we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again, in the\ntwilight, I foresaw it all: I saw how clearly and inevitably things\nwere driving for war in Evesham's silly, violent hands, and I had some\ninkling of what war was bound to be under these new conditions. And even\nthen, though I knew it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity, I\ncould find no will to go back.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"That was my last chance.\n\n\"We didn't go into the city until the sky was full of stars, so we\nwalked out upon the high terrace, to and fro, and--she counselled me to\ngo back.\n\n\"'My dearest,' she said, and her sweet face looked up to me, 'this is\nDeath. This life you lead is Death. Go back to them, go back to your\nduty--.'\n\n\"She began to weep, saying, between her sobs, and clinging to my arm as\nshe said it, 'Go back--Go back.'\n\n\"Then suddenly she fell mute, and, glancing down at her face, I read in\nan instant the thing she had thought to do. It was one of those moments\nwhen one SEES.\n\n\"'No!' I said.\n\n\"'No?' she asked, in surprise, and I think a little fearful at the\nanswer to her thought.\n\n\"'Nothing,' I said, 'shall send me back. Nothing! I have chosen. Love,\nI have chosen, and the world must go. Whatever happens I will live this\nlife--I will live for YOU! It--nothing shall turn me aside; nothing, my\ndear one. Even if you died--even if you died--'\n\n\"'Yes,' she murmured, softly.\n\n\"'Then--I also would die.'\n\n\"And before she could speak again I began to talk, talking\neloquently--as I COULD do in that life--talking to exalt love, to make\nthe life we were living seem heroic and glorious; and the thing I was\ndeserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing\nto set aside. I bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it, seeking\nnot only to convert her but myself to that. We talked, and she clung to\nme, torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew\nwas sweet. And at last I did make it heroic, made all the thickening\ndisaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our\nunparalleled love, and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at\nlast, clad in that splendid delusion, drunken rather with that glorious\ndelusion, under the still stars.\n\n\"And so my moment passed.\n\n\"It was my last chance. Even as we went to and fro there, the leaders of\nthe south and east were gathering their resolve, and the hot answer that\nshattered Evesham's bluffing for ever, took shape and waited. And all\nover Asia, and the ocean, and the south, the air and the wires were\nthrobbing with their warnings to prepare--prepare.\n\n\"No one living, you know, knew what war was; no one could imagine, with\nall these new inventions, what horror war might bring. I believe most\npeople still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and\nshouting charges and triumphs and flags and bands--in a time when half\nthe world drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away--.\"\n\nThe man with the white face paused. I glanced at him, and his face was\nintent on the floor of the carriage. A little railway station, a string\nof loaded trucks, a signal-box, and the back of a cottage, shot by the\ncarriage window, and a bridge passed with a clap of noise, echoing the\ntumult of the train.\n\n\"After that,\" he said, \"I dreamt often. For three weeks of nights that\ndream was my life. And the worst of it was there were nights when I\ncould not dream, when I lay tossing on a bed in THIS accursed life; and\nTHERE--somewhere lost to me--things were happening--momentous, terrible\nthings.... I lived at nights--my days, my waking days, this life I am\nliving now, became a faded, far-away dream, a drab setting, the cover of\nthe book.\"\n\nHe thought.\n\n\"I could tell you all, tell you every little thing in the dream, but as\nto what I did in the daytime--no. I could not tell--I do not remember.\nMy memory--my memory has gone. The business of life slips from me--\"\n\nHe leant forward, and pressed his hands upon his eyes. For a long time\nhe said nothing.\n\n\"And then?\" said I.\n\n\"The war burst like a hurricane.\"\n\nHe stared before him at unspeakable things.\n\n\"And then?\" I urged again.\n\n\"One touch of unreality,\" he said, in the low tone of a man who speaks\nto himself, \"and they would have been nightmares. But they were not\nnightmares--they were not nightmares. NO!\"\n\nHe was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger\nof losing the rest of the story. But he went on talking again in the\nsame tone of questioning self-communion.\n\n\"What was there to do but flight? I had not thought the war would touch\nCapri--I had seemed to see Capri as being out of it all, as the contrast\nto it all; but two nights after the whole place was shouting and\nbawling, every woman almost and every other man wore a badge--Evesham's\nbadge--and there was no music but a jangling war-song over and over\nagain, and everywhere men enlisting, and in the dancing halls they were\ndrilling. The whole island was awhirl with rumours; it was said, again\nand again, that fighting had begun. I had not expected this. I had seen\nso little of the life of pleasure that I had failed to reckon with this\nviolence of the amateurs. And as for me, I was out of it. I was like\na man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine. The time had\ngone. I was no one; the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more\nthan I. The crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears; that accursed song\ndeafened us; a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her,\nand we two went back to our own place again, ruffled and insulted--my\nlady white and silent, and I aquiver with rage. So furious was I,\nI could have quarrelled with her if I could have found one shade of\naccusation in her eyes.\n\n\"All my magnificence had gone from me. I walked up and down our rock\ncell, and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that\nflared and passed and came again.\n\n\"'We must get out of this place,' I said over and over. 'I have made my\nchoice, and I will have no hand in these troubles. I will have nothing\nof this war. We have taken our lives out of all these things. This is no\nrefuge for us. Let us go.'\n\n\"And the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered\nthe world.\n\n\"And all the rest was Flight--all the rest was Flight.\"\n\nHe mused darkly.\n\n\"How much was there of it?\"\n\nHe made no answer.\n\n\"How many days?\"\n\nHis face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched. He took no\nheed of my curiosity.\n\nI tried to draw him back to his story with questions.\n\n\"Where did you go?\" I said.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When you left Capri.\"\n\n\"Southwest,\" he said, and glanced at me for a second. \"We went in a\nboat.\"\n\n\"But I should have thought an aeroplane?\"\n\n\"They had been seized.\"\n\nI questioned him no more. Presently I thought he was beginning again. He\nbroke out in an argumentative monotone:\n\n\"But why should it be? If, indeed, this battle, this slaughter and\nstress IS life, why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty? If\nthere IS no refuge, if there is no place of peace, and if all our dreams\nof quiet places are a folly and a snare, why have we such dreams? Surely\nit was no ignoble cravings, no base intentions, had brought us to this;\nit was Love had isolated us. Love had come to me with her eyes and robed\nin her beauty, more glorious than all else in life, in the very shape\nand colour of life, and summoned me away. I had silenced all the voices,\nI had answered all the questions--I had come to her. And suddenly there\nwas nothing but War and Death!\"\n\nI had an inspiration. \"After all,\" I said, \"it could have been only a\ndream.\"\n\n\"A dream!\" he cried, flaming upon me, \"a dream--when even now--\"\n\nFor the first time he became animated. A faint flush crept into his\ncheek. He raised his open hand and clenched it, and dropped it to his\nknee. He spoke, looking away from me, and for all the rest of the time\nhe looked away. \"We are but phantoms,\" he said, \"and the phantoms of\nphantoms, desires like cloud shadows and wills of straw that eddy in the\nwind; the days pass, use and wont carry us through as a train carries\nthe shadow of its lights, so be it! But one thing is real and certain,\none thing is no dreamstuff, but eternal and enduring. It is the centre\nof my life, and all other things about it are subordinate or altogether\nvain. I loved her, that woman of a dream. And she and I are dead\ntogether!\n\n\"A dream! How can it be a dream, when it drenched a living life with\nunappeasable sorrow, when it makes all that I have lived for and cared\nfor, worthless and unmeaning?\n\n\"Until that very moment when she was killed I believed we had still a\nchance of getting away,\" he said. \"All through the night and morning\nthat we sailed across the sea from Capri to Salerno, we talked of\nescape. We were full of hope, and it clung about us to the end, hope for\nthe life together we should lead, out of it all, out of the battle and\nstruggle, the wild and empty passions, the empty arbitrary 'thou shalt'\nand 'thou shalt not' of the world. We were uplifted, as though our quest\nwas a holy thing, as though love for one another was a mission....\n\n\"Even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock\nCapri--already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and\nhiding-places that were to make it a fastness--we reckoned nothing of\nthe imminent slaughter, though the fury of preparation hung about in\npuffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst the grey; but,\nindeed, I made a text of that and talked. There, you know, was the\nrock, still beautiful, for all its scars, with its countless windows and\narches and ways, tier upon tier, for a thousand feet, a vast carving\nof grey, broken by vine-clad terraces, and lemon and orange groves, and\nmasses of agave and prickly pear, and puffs of almond blossom. And out\nunder the archway that is built over the Piccola Marina other boats were\ncoming; and as we came round the cape and within sight of the mainland,\nanother little string of boats came into view, driving before the wind\ntowards the southwest. In a little while a multitude had come out, the\nremoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the eastward\ncliff.\n\n\"'It is love and reason,' I said, 'fleeing from all this madness, of\nwar.'\n\n\"And though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the\nsouthern sky we did not heed it. There it was--a line of little dots in\nthe sky--and then more, dotting the southeastern horizon, and then still\nmore, until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks.\nNow they were all thin little strokes of blue, and now one and now\na multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of\nlight. They came rising and falling and growing larger, like some huge\nflight of gulls or rooks, or such-like birds moving with a marvellous\nuniformity, and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater\nwidth of sky. The southward wing flung itself in an arrow-headed cloud\nathwart the sun. And then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and\nstreamed eastward, growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer\nagain until they vanished from the sky. And after that we noted to the\nnorthward and very high Evesham's fighting machines hanging high over\nNaples like an evening swarm of gnats.\n\n\"It seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds.\n\n\"Even the mutter of guns far away in the southeast seemed to us to\nsignify nothing....\n\n\"Each day, each dream after that, we were still exalted, still seeking\nthat refuge where we might live and love. Fatigue had come upon us,\npain and many distresses. For though we were dusty and stained by our\ntoilsome tramping, and half starved and with the horror of the dead\nmen we had seen and the flight of the peasants--for very soon a gust of\nfighting swept up the peninsula--with these things haunting our minds it\nstill resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape. O, but she was\nbrave and patient! She who had never faced hardship and exposure had\ncourage for herself--and me. We went to and fro seeking an outlet, over\na country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war.\nAlways we went on foot. At first there were other fugitives, but we did\nnot mingle with them. Some escaped northward, some were caught in\nthe torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads; many gave\nthemselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward. Many\nof the men were impressed. But we kept away from these things; we had\nbrought no money to bribe a passage north, and I feared for my lady at\nthe hands of these conscript crowds. We had landed at Salerno, and\nwe had been turned back from Cava, and we had tried to cross towards\nTaranto by a pass over Mount Alburno, but we had been driven back for\nwant of food, and so we had come down among the marshes by Paestum,\nwhere those great temples stand alone. I had some vague idea that by\nPaestum it might be possible to find a boat or something, and take once\nmore to sea. And there it was the battle overtook us.\n\n\"A sort of soul-blindness had me. Plainly I could see that we were being\nhemmed in; that the great net of that giant Warfare had us in its toils.\nMany times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north\ngoing to and fro, and had come upon them in the distance amidst the\nmountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of\nthe guns. Once we fancied they had fired at us, taking us for spies--at\nany rate a shot had gone shuddering over us. Several times we had hidden\nin woods from hovering aeroplanes.\n\n\"But all these things do not matter now, these nights of flight and\npain.... We were in an open place near those great temples at Paestum,\nat last, on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes, empty and\ndesolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the\nfeet of its stems. How I can see it! My lady was sitting down under\na bush, resting a little, for she was very weak and weary, and I was\nstanding up watching to see if I could tell the distance of the firing\nthat came and went. They were still, you know, fighting far from each\nother, with those terrible new weapons that had never before been used:\nguns that would carry beyond sight, and aeroplanes that would do--What\nTHEY would do no man could foretell.\n\n\"I knew that we were between the two armies, and that they drew\ntogether. I knew we were in danger, and that we could not stop there and\nrest!\n\n\"Though all these things were in my mind, they were in the background.\nThey seemed to be affairs beyond our concern. Chiefly, I was thinking of\nmy lady. An aching distress filled me. For the first time she had owned\nherself beaten and had fallen a-weeping. Behind me I could hear her\nsobbing, but I would not turn round to her because I knew she had need\nof weeping, and had held herself so far and so long for me. It was well,\nI thought, that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again,\nfor I had no inkling of the thing that hung so near. Even now I can see\nher as she sat there, her lovely hair upon her shoulder, can mark again\nthe deepening hollow of her cheek.\n\n\"'If we had parted,' she said, 'if I had let you go.'\n\n\"'No,' said I. 'Even now, I do not repent. I will not repent; I made my\nchoice, and I will hold on to the end.\"\n\n\"And then--\n\n\"Overhead in the sky something flashed and burst, and all about us I\nheard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown.\nThey chipped the stones about us, and whirled fragments from the bricks\nand passed....\"\n\nHe put his hand to his mouth, and then moistened his lips.\n\n\"At the flash I had turned about....\n\n\"You know--she stood up--\n\n\"She stood up; you know, and moved a step towards me--\n\n\"As though she wanted to reach me--\n\n\"And she had been shot through the heart.\"\n\nHe stopped and stared at me. I felt all that foolish incapacity an\nEnglishman feels on such occasions. I met his eyes for a moment, and\nthen stared out of the window. For a long space we kept silence. When at\nlast I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded,\nand his teeth gnawing at his knuckles.\n\nHe bit his nail suddenly, and stared at it.\n\n\"I carried her,\" he said, \"towards the temples, in my arms--as though it\nmattered. I don't know why. They seemed a sort of sanctuary, you know,\nthey had lasted so long, I suppose.\n\n\"She must have died almost instantly. Only--I talked to her--all the\nway.\"\n\nSilence again.\n\n\"I have seen those temples,\" I said abruptly, and indeed he had brought\nthose still, sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me.\n\n\"It was the brown one, the big brown one. I sat down on a fallen pillar\nand held her in my arms.... Silent after the first babble was over. And\nafter a little while the lizards came out and ran about again, as though\nnothing unusual was going on, as though nothing had changed.... It was\ntremendously still there, the sun high, and the shadows still; even the\nshadows of the weeds upon the entablature were still--in spite of the\nthudding and banging that went all about the sky.\n\n\"I seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south, and\nthat the battle went away to the west. One aeroplane was struck, and\noverset and fell. I remember that--though it didn't interest me in\nthe least. It didn't seem to signify. It was like a wounded gull, you\nknow--flapping for a time in the water. I could see it down the aisle of\nthe temple--a black thing in the bright blue water.\n\n\"Three or four times shells burst about the beach, and then that ceased.\nEach time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space.\nThat was all the mischief done, except that once a stray bullet gashed\nthe stone hard by--made just a fresh bright surface.\n\n\"As the shadows grew longer, the stillness seemed greater.\n\n\"The curious thing,\" he remarked, with the manner of a man who makes a\ntrivial conversation, \"is that I didn't THINK--I didn't think at all.\nI sat with her in my arms amidst the stones--in a sort of\nlethargy--stagnant.\n\n\"And I don't remember waking up. I don't remember dressing that day. I\nknow I found myself in my office, with my letters all slit open in front\nof me, and how I was struck by the absurdity of being there, seeing that\nin reality I was sitting, stunned, in that Paestum temple with a dead\nwoman in my arms. I read my letters like a machine. I have forgotten\nwhat they were about.\"\n\nHe stopped, and there was a long silence.\n\nSuddenly I perceived that we were running down the incline from Chalk\nFarm to Euston. I started at this passing of time. I turned on him with\na brutal question, with the tone of Now or never.\n\n\"And did you dream again?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe seemed to force himself to finish. His voice was very low.\n\n\"Once more, and as it were only for a few instants. I seemed to have\nsuddenly awakened out of a great apathy, to have risen into a sitting\nposition, and the body lay there on the stones beside me. A gaunt body.\nNot her, you know. So soon--it was not her....\n\n\"I may have heard voices. I do not know. Only I knew clearly that men\nwere coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage.\n\n\"I stood up and walked through the temple, and then there came into\nsight--first one man with a yellow face, dressed in a uniform of dirty\nwhite, trimmed with blue, and then several, climbing to the crest of\nthe old wall of the vanished city, and crouching there. They were little\nbright figures in the sunlight, and there they hung, weapon in hand,\npeering cautiously before them.\n\n\"And further away I saw others and then more at another point in the\nwall. It was a long lax line of men in open order.\n\n\"Presently the man I had first seen stood up and shouted a command, and\nhis men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the\ntemple. He scrambled down with them and led them. He came facing towards\nme, and when he saw me he stopped.\n\n\"At first I had watched these men with a mere curiosity, but when I\nhad seen they meant to come to the temple I was moved to forbid them. I\nshouted to the officer.\n\n\"'You must not come here,' I cried, '_I_ am here. I am here with my\ndead.'\n\n\"He stared, and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown\ntongue.\n\n\"I repeated what I had said.\n\n\"He shouted again, and I folded my arms and stood still. Presently he\nspoke to his men and came forward. He carried a drawn sword.\n\n\"I signed to him to keep away, but he continued to advance. I told him\nagain very patiently and clearly: 'You must not come here. These are old\ntemples and I am here with my dead.'\n\n\"Presently he was so close I could see his face clearly. It was a narrow\nface, with dull grey eyes, and a black moustache. He had a scar on\nhis upper lip, and he was dirty and unshaven. He kept shouting\nunintelligible things, questions perhaps, at me.\n\n\"I know now that he was afraid of me, but at the time that did not\noccur to me. As I tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious\ntones, bidding me, I suppose, stand aside.\n\n\"He made to go past me, And I caught hold of him.\n\n\"I saw his face change at my grip.\n\n\"'You fool,' I cried. 'Don't you know? She is dead!'\n\n\"He started back. He looked at me with cruel eyes. I saw a sort of\nexultant resolve leap into them--delight. Then, suddenly, with a scowl,\nhe swept his sword back--SO--and thrust.\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly. I became aware of a change in the rhythm of the\ntrain. The brakes lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and\njerked. This present world insisted upon itself, became clamorous. I saw\nthrough the steamy window huge electric lights glaring down from tall\nmasts upon a fog, saw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by, and\nthen a signal-box, hoisting its constellation of green and red into the\nmurky London twilight marched after them. I looked again at his drawn\nfeatures.\n\n\"He ran me through the heart. It was with a sort of astonishment--no\nfear, no pain--but just amazement, that I felt it pierce me, felt the\nsword drive home into my body. It didn't hurt, you know. It didn't hurt\nat all.\"\n\nThe yellow platform lights came into the field of view, passing first\nrapidly, then slowly, and at last stopping with a jerk. Dim shapes of\nmen passed to and fro without.\n\n\"Euston!\" cried a voice.\n\n\"Do you mean--?\"\n\n\"There was no pain, no sting or smart. Amazement and then darkness\nsweeping over everything. The hot, brutal face before me, the face\nof the man who had killed me, seemed to recede. It swept out of\nexistence--\"\n\n\"Euston!\" clamoured the voices outside; \"Euston!\"\n\nThe carriage door opened, admitting a flood of sound, and a porter stood\nregarding us. The sounds of doors slamming, and the hoof-clatter of\ncab-horses, and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the\nLondon cobble-stones, came to my ears. A truckload of lighted lamps\nblazed along the platform.\n\n\"A darkness, a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out\nall things.\"\n\n\"Any luggage, sir?\" said the porter.\n\n\"And that was the end?\" I asked.\n\nHe seemed to hesitate. Then, almost inaudibly, he answered, \"No.\"\n\n\"You mean?\"\n\n\"I couldn't get to her. She was there on the other side of the\nTemple--And then--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I insisted. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Nightmares,\" he cried; \"nightmares indeed! My God! Great birds that\nfought and tore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Twelve Stories and a Dream, by H. G.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
