COLE\n\n                    Illustrated by Freas\n\n\nElwar Forell leaned back in his chair, looking about the small dining\nsalon. The usual couples were there, he noticed. Of course, the faces\nwere different from those of last evening, but the poses were similar.\nAnd the people were there for the same reasons. They were enjoying the\nfood and drinks, just as many others had enjoyed them before. But like\nall those others, their greater enjoyment was in the company of one\nanother. Forell glanced at the vacant chair across the table from him\nand sighed.\n\nIt would be nice, he thought, if-- But any arrangement involving a\npermanent companion would be hardly practical under his circumstances.\nAfter all, prudence dictated limits.\n\nHe picked up his cup and drained it, then leaned back and beckoned the\nwaiter over.\n\n\"The reckoning, please,\" he ordered.\n\nHe looked again at the letter on the table before him, then folded it\nand put it in his pocket. It was well, he thought. His latest book of\nfairy tales and fantasy had enjoyed good acceptance. And the check in\nthe letter had been of satisfactory size. He smiled to himself. There\nwere compensations in this job of his. It seemed to be profitable to\nhave a purpose other than the obvious and usual one.\n\nHe paid his bill and left the restaurant, to walk slowly along the\nstreet, enjoying the mild, spring air.\n\nAs he passed a sidewalk caf\u00e9, a man beckoned from one of the tables.\n\n\"Oh, Forell,\" he called. \"I was hoping I'd see you this evening.\" He\nheld up a book.\n\n\"Just finished your 'Tales of the Sorcerers,'\" he added. \"Some of those\nyarns of yours seem almost real.\"\n\nElwar Forell nodded. They should, he thought. Factual material, however\ndisguised, often shines through its fictional background. And he had an\ninexhaustible source of material, drawn from many sources. He twisted\nhis face into a gratified smile.\n\n\"That's my objective,\" he said aloud. \"I do all in my power to place the\nreader inside the story.\"\n\nCharo Andorra nodded. \"It's the secret of good fiction, I know,\" he\nadmitted, \"and every storyteller tries to do it. But I seem to see more\nthan that in your stuff. There's an almost believable pattern.\" He\nhesitated. \"You know, while I'm reading it, I can almost see beings of\nsuperior powers walking the earth. And sometimes, I visualize us working\nwith them.\" He laughed shortly.\n\n\"Of course, I may be more credulous and imaginative than most. Probably\nwhy I'm a critic. And I really should know better.\" He looked down at\nthe book in his hands.\n\n\"But that stuff of yours can be mighty convincing.\" He tilted his head.\n\"Somehow, I can't help but look at some of the old legends--and some of\nthe things that have happened in more recent years, too. Can't help but\nwonder if we actually are babes of the cosmos, and if we haven't been\nvisited and watched by some form of extra-planetary life at one time or\nanother.\"\n\nForell looked closely at his friend. Andorra, he knew, was a clear\nthinker in his own right. And he just might start a serious\nanalysis--and publish it. He grimaced. It wasn't time for that, he knew.\nMany years must pass before it would be time.\n\nHe placed a hand on the back of Andorra's chair, remembering the words\nof one of the teachers.\n\n_\"Remember, Elwar,\" he had been told, \"your objective is clear, but your\nmethods must be most indirect--even unclear. Some things you must\nobscure in a mass of obviously imaginative detail, while you bring\nothers to the fore. You must hint. You must suggest. You should never\nfully explain or deny. And you must never be guilty of definite, direct\nfalsehood._\n\n_\"There may come a time when you will be directly questioned--when\ndiscovery of your real background and purpose seems imminent, and you\nwill have to take positive action. For such an eventuality, I cannot\noutline any steps, or even any definite plan of action, since I neither\nfully understand many of the factors involved, nor have any way of\nknowing the circumstances which may arise. You'll have to prepare\nyourself for almost anything, always keeping in mind the peculiarities\nand capabilities of your own people.\"_\n\nIt looked as though the time might have come. If Andorra, a clever,\ninfluential critic, should guess at the real background and the sources\nof the Forell tales, and if he should misunderstand the motives behind\nthose tales, he would probably publish his thoughts. And those thoughts\nwould be widely read. Many would smile as they read and regard the thing\nas a hoax. But others might start their own analyses. And some of those\nmight come to highly undesirable conclusions and cause undesirable,\neven disastrous, reactions. It would be many generations before clear\nexplanations could be made and definite principles outlined without\ncausing misunderstanding and serious damage. The Forell tales were\nevasive and preparatory as well as vaguely instructive.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe recovered his self-discipline and waved his hand negligently.\n\n\"You know, Charo,\" he said laughingly, \"I've been thinking along similar\nlines for a long while. Of course, you know I must have built up some\nsort of fantasy world to base my yarns on?\"\n\nAndorra nodded. \"That's obvious. I've been wondering about some of your\nbasic theory. Like to see your notes some time.\"\n\nForell spread his hands. \"You're quite welcome to look them over,\" he\nsaid. \"Come on up to my rooms now.\" He smiled. \"As a matter of fact,\nI've been doing a little extension on my dream world. Built up a little\nsketch a while ago, and I'm not just sure what to do with it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they entered the study, Forell walked across to his desk. He fumbled\nfor a few seconds under the desk, then opened a drawer. For a moment, he\npaused, looking inside, then pulled out a thin folder. Again, he\nhesitated. At last, he picked a small, metallic object from the drawer\nand held it in his left hand.\n\n\"Might need this,\" he told himself. \"If I'm wrong, it'll take a sector\npatrolman to straighten out the mess. And I could be wrong--two ways.\"\n\nCasually, he placed his left hand in his pocket, then he turned toward\nAndorra, holding out the folder.\n\n\"Here,\" he said. \"See what you think of this one.\"\n\nAndorra opened the folder, taking out a few sheets of paper. He read for\na moment, then looked up quizzically.\n\n\"A little different from your usual style, isn't it?\"\n\nForell nodded, watching the man tensely. \"I'm trying something new,\" he\nsaid. \"Go ahead and read it, then tell me what you think.\"\n\nHe busied himself with a bottle and glasses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nINFORMAL MEMO\n\n                                                            130-263\n From: Explorations Officer, Sector Nine\n To: Ecological Officer\n Subject: Incident Report\n\nEnclosed is the file on that recent occurrence on Planet 3-G3-9/4871,\nconsisting of the certificates and statements of the various officers\nand guardsmen concerned, together with a digest of the interrogation of\nElwar Forell, a young planetary native, who appears to have been the\ninstigator.\n\nIt seems to me that something is seriously wrong with our system of\noperation, at least on the subject planet. After all, our operations\nhave the purpose of research and observation, with a view to protection\nand development. Certainly, we cannot create chaos. And knowledge of our\nexistence by very young cultures would certainly cause just that. We've\ngot to clear this up in a hurry. The Elder Galactics are most certain to\nbe unhappy about it in any event, and I don't like to make them unhappy.\n\nObviously, there was a chain of errors, and some of our people concerned\nwill have to be reassigned for further training, but that's just the\nbeginning. I've recalled all the observers from this planet, pending\nreorganization, and we've got to come up with an answer that'll prevent\nfurther occurrences of this nature, as well as covering this affair on\nthe planet concerned.\n\nI realize that the situation has some of the elements of comedy, and I\npresume that it will eventually be regarded with considerable amusement,\nbut right at the moment, my sense of humor is working very poorly.\n\nI have a few ideas of my own, but would like to have your\nrecommendations and those of other section officers before I make any\nfinal decision or report. I am calling a conference on this incident at\n280.1000, so make a full investigation on this, and give me some\npractical recommendation as soon as possible.\n\n                                        CIJORN\n 6 enclosures\n\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nI, Florand Anremdor, am assigned to the Communications Branch,\nExploratory Section, Sector Nine.\n\nAt 261.0196, I was on duty in the emergency communications room at\nIncrement Four. A call came in from Resident Station number fourteen,\nPlanet 3-G3-9/4871, requesting emergency condensation over the immediate\nstation area. Co-ordinates were not given and I checked the planetary\nco-ordinates with the call sign and the Communications List. I added\nthese to the message and forwarded the request to the Patrol Duty\nOfficer for his action.\n\nThere was no visual on the call, but the voice sounded urgent. I relayed\nthe request without requiring special authentication, since the station\nwas precisely on the correct settings, no inimical culture is known to\nbe operating in this sector, and the coded call was correct. At the\ntime, I had no way of suspecting that this was not a genuine emergency\ncall.\n\n                                        Florand Anremdor\n                                        Comm. 1/c\n\n\nCERTIFICATE\n\nI, Captain Binkar Morancos, am assigned to the 334th Vector, which is\npresently under the orders of the Commander, Sector Nine.\n\nI was assigned as Sector Patrol Duty Officer at 261.0200, when a message\nwas relayed from Increment Four, requesting emergency condensation on a\nplanet in that increment. I checked the co-ordinates and data furnished,\nconsulted the situation chart, and instructed Cruiser P-4730, Captain\nKlorantel commanding, to carry out the mission.\n\nSince the message came through normal channels, I had no doubt as to its\nauthenticity, and treated it as routine. I felt that the cruiser\ncommander could deal with the matter at his discretion.\n\n                                        Binkar Morancos\n                                        Capt. StG(C)\n\n\nCERTIFICATE\n\nI, Captain Corrondao Klorantel, am in command of the Stellar Guard\nCruiser _Myloren_, number P-4730. I am assigned to duty with the 334th\nVector, which is operating in Sector Nine.\n\nThe _Myloren_ was on routine patrol in the Fourth Increment at 261.0203,\nwhen a message was received from Sector Headquarters, giving\nco-ordinates on Planet 3-G3-9/4871, with a request for emergency\ncondensation. I proceeded to the subject planet and took position\noutside the atmosphere. Visual checks failed to show any emergency\ncondition on the surface, though a burned-out area was noted in the\nforest a short distance to the planetary south of the station concerned.\nA call was made to the resident station, requesting clarification of the\nrequest, and the answer proved to be unsatisfactory.\n\nThere was no visual transmission, and the voice was strongly accented.\nThe message gave insufficient data for action, contained no\nidentification, and was in improper form for station-to-ship contact. I\ndecided to make contact by other means, and shifted my secondary\ncommunicator to the guardsman's personal settings, requesting further\ninformation, suitable identification, and confirmation of the request.\nGuardsman Jaeger immediately informed me that the call was spurious,\nstating that he was away from his station, and that he would return\nimmediately. During the conversation, I noted that full condensation was\ntaking place to atmospheric limits.\n\nI called Auxiliary, and Technician Melran stated that his control\ncircuits were inoperative and that he was tracing the difficulty. He\ncleared the trouble, but condensation had already been established and\nprecipitation had commenced. I ordered re-absorption, which was started\nas soon as repairs had been accomplished.\n\nAt the request of Guardsman Jaeger, we stood by to render aid if\nnecessary, maintaining contact with his station. At 0572, Jaeger\nrequested immediate evacuation for himself and for one other person. I\nentered atmosphere, made planetfall with nullified visibility, and took\noff the guardsman and a young native. During the evacuation, I noted a\nnumber of natives armed with various implements, who were attempting to\nbreak their way into the station. Guardsman Jaeger fired his demolitions\nas he left, firing the screen generator with his last flare. For a few\nminutes, the natives fell back before the flames, but they were entering\nthe station by the time we cleared the planet. It is believed that the\ninstallation was completely destroyed.\n\n                                        Corrondao Klorantel\n                                        Capt. StG(C)\n                                        Commanding P-4730\n\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nI, Danaeo Melran, am assigned to the Patrol Cruiser _Myloren_, number\nP-4730, for duty.\n\nAt 261.0204, I was on duty in Auxiliary Equipment when Captain Klorantel\ncalled, informing me that a request had come in for emergency\ncondensation. He told me to set up and await execution order. I preset\ntwo forward radiators for forty kilometers at low condensation, with a\nthree kilometer radius at surface. I then put the controls on automatic\ntrigger, notified the captain, and went on with my normal duties. At\n0221, we came out of trans-light, and I adjusted my equipment for\nslow-drive operation.\n\nAt 0223, my indicators showed activity on the forward radiators. I\nchecked and discovered that full power was being applied. Attempts to\noverride the automatics were unsuccessful, and while I was attempting to\nclear the trouble, the captain called again, saying that the request was\nfalse, and asking why I had turned the radiators on. I told him that the\ncontrols were jammed, and he instructed me to make repairs and set up\nre-absorption.\n\nI discovered a short between the automatic trigger and the ship's\nsecondary communication antenna. After clearing this, I found trouble in\nthe control section of the condensation driver. The automatic trigger\nhad become fused, and the control paths were shorted to full-drive\nthroughout. The sub-assemblies were replaced and trouble cleared by\n0300. I then set up re-absorption as ordered.\n\n                                        Danaeo Melran\n                                        Eq Tech 3/c\n\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nI, Franz Jaeger, am Resident Guardsman at Station Fourteen, Planet\n3-G3-9/4871.\n\nI have been assigned to my station for eight planetary years for survey\nand observation duty. During the past five years, I have employed Elwar\nForell, the son of a local peasant, to keep the living quarters clean\nand to do general work about the station. I have never discussed the\npossibilities of extra-planetary civilization with him, and I have been\ncareful to exclude him from knowledge of my technical equipment, which I\nhave kept in a secure room in accordance with regulations. I have\npresented myself to him, as well as to all the villagers in my area, as\na scholar, tired of city life, and desirous of a quiet existence.\n\nThere has been a drought in part of my area for the entire season. We\nhave suffered from one forest fire and there is a strong possibility of\nothers. Crops are doing very badly, and the peasants have been\ncomplaining bitterly. This is not an unheard-of situation, but it has\ncaused considerable discomfort and worry, since there is a very definite\nthreat of famine. There have been numerous attempts to obtain rain by\noccult means, and I have been personally approached on the matter. For\nsome time, the villagers in the immediate area of the station have\nregarded me as a sorcerer, and I have been asked to cast a spell to\ncause rain.\n\nI had considered a request for light condensation, but had hesitated to\nmake such a request, since I felt that rain closely following the\nvillagers' petition to me would confirm their supernatural beliefs,\nwhich I have attempted to discourage.\n\nAt 261.0223, I was on a routine tour of my area. I received a call from\nthe cruiser _Myloren_, Captain Klorantel commanding, asking for further\ninformation on a request for emergency condensation. I informed him that\nI had made no such request, adding that a light rain would be desirable\nif he were in position and prepared to radiate.\n\nDuring the conversation with Captain Klorantel, I noted that the sky was\ndarkening. There were several flashes of lightning, and I felt the signs\nof imminent, heavy rain. I promptly started back to my station.\n\nUpon my arrival, I discovered that Elwar had managed to open the\ncommunications room and had been using the equipment. He was extremely\nfrightened, and made incoherent remarks about talking to a demon. When I\nattempted to question him as to how he had opened the room, and where he\nhad learned the operation of the communications equipment, he became\nhysterical and I could find out precisely nothing.\n\nBy this time, it was raining violently. There was a high wind. Several\ntrees had been blown down and lightning was frequent. A flood was\nstarting down the mountainside toward the village, threatening severe\ndamage. It was quite apparent that crops, such as they were, would be\nalmost completely destroyed.\n\nAt the time, I could do little to remedy the situation. I re-established\ncontact with the cruiser, informed Captain Klorantel of the situation,\nand requested that he stand by. I then turned on my viewsphere to keep\nwatch on the village from the communications room. Since Elwar had been\nin the room on several previous occasions, I saw no reason for excluding\nhim. On the contrary, I thought it would be advisable to keep him with\nme, since I felt that he would be seriously injured if he were turned\nloose in the village. I do not believe he would have survived the fury\nof the villagers, who had taken shelter, and were watching the\ndestruction of their crops.\n\nThe flood had become a torrent, which overflowed the banks of the\nvillage brook, tore at the bridge, and swept through the lanes. In the\nfields, grain was beaten into the ground and it was clear that the\nvillagers would have little or no harvest to celebrate during the\napproaching festival. The wind grew in force, lashing at the tall\nfestival pole, which bent, crashed down in the village square, and\npartially demolished the front of the inn.\n\nDuring this period, there was no human activity, since everyone had\ntaken what shelter he could find.\n\nAt 0448, the rain slackened, the wind died down, and people started\ngathering in the square. For a time, they milled about, wading through\nthe ebbing flood. They examined the damage, then they gathered in\ngroups, talking earnestly.\n\nThe dry wind came up at 0510, and by 0550, the entire village was on the\nmarch toward my station. Their intentions were quite easy to determine.\nThey were armed with pitchforks, scythes, axes, and other tools which\ncould be converted to offensive use. I established a protective screen,\nbut realized that to set up a permanent defense would be impractical and\neven harmful. I therefore called the cruiser, requesting evacuation for\nmyself and for young Forell. Prior to evacuation, I demolished all my\nfixed equipment, so that the only things left for the villagers to find\nwhen they entered the station were damaged remains of those things\nnormal for a recluse scholar of their era.\n\n                                        Franz Jaeger\n                                        Observer 2/c\n\n\nINFORMAL MEMO\n\n                                                            130-265\n\n From: Evaluations Officer\n To: Explorations Officer\n Subject: Interrogation\n\nEnclosed is a digest of the interrogation of one, Elwar Forell, who was\nevacuated from forty-eight seventy-one, in company with Guardsman\nJaeger. This boy was abjectly terrified and had to be calmed several\ntimes during questioning. He was pitiably hysterical when recalling his\nconversation with Captain Klorantel, who, you will remember, is a\ncapriform humanoid.\n\nThe subject appears to be an intelligent specimen of his race, and when\nhe had conquered his hysteria, was extremely co-operative, showing\nactive interest in his surroundings. I believe he would be able to\nassimilate training, and would make a valuable addition to the Stellar\nGuard. I recommend his retention and training.\n\nIf Elwar is a typical \"son of a simple peasant,\" and if the planet from\nwhich he comes has any considerable number of \"simple peasants\" with\nsons like him, I can foresee some strangely interesting problems in\nconnection with further dealings on that planet.\n\n                                        FONZEC\n 1 enclosure\n\n\nDIGEST\n\nInterrogation of Elwar Forell, native of Planet 3-G3-9/4871.\n\n\"My Masters, I did mean no harm, but only good. I have long known that\nmy master was possessed of power denied to most men. When I was\napprenticed to him five years ago, I thought I would one day learn some\nof the dark secrets of the hidden worlds, but never did my master\nmention aught of those secrets he so surely knew. He taught me only of\nthose things known to the scholars. He told me of reading, of writing,\nand of ciphering, and taught me many facts of our world which are known\nto the learned. I wished to know of many other things, but of these he\nwas silent. Even so, I am grateful for his teachings, for how else could\nthe son of a simple peasant gain the knowledge of the scholars?\n\n\"I saw that my master often repaired to a room which I was never allowed\nto enter. This room he cleaned himself. And he always entered in the\ngreatest of secrecy, being quite cross with me when I once betrayed\ncuriosity. I remained curious, however, and fell at last to watching him\nin secret as he opened the door.\n\n\"He slid aside a secret panel, then turned a wheel this way and that,\nfinally pushing a handle. I watched, at last learning to what numbers he\ndid turn the wheel, and how he pushed the handle. During his absences, I\nwent sometimes to that room of magic, and I read the books of power,\nthough there was much I could not read, since much of the writing was in\nstrange tongues and I dared not ask my master the meanings of the\nstrange words. But for his own convenience, my master had written many\ninstructions plainly. And these, I read.\n\n\"I did learn that there were powers beyond those of men. I learned that\nthese strange instruments on the table did have strange ability to call\nforth demons and spirits, but never until that day did I dare touch\nother than the books and papers. And those I took great care to restore\nto their original condition.\n\n\"For three months past, my father's land and the fields of his neighbors\nhave been dry. During this time, there has been no rain, nor hint of\nrain, and the peasants have cried out for relief. They have appealed\neven to my master, who has told them that he has no strange powers--that\nhe can do naught to call up rain. But they did not believe him, nor did\nI, Elwar, who knew better than this. I had seen the books of power, and\nI knew the demons could cause the skies to deliver water if rightly\nasked. So, I visited the room of magic upon the occasions of my master's\nabsence. And I tried to decipher his writings that I might find the\nmeans to ask for the skies to open. Always, when I felt my master's\npresence approaching, I left the room, taking care to properly lock the\ndoor and to hide all evidence of my entry.\n\n\"On that day of direful events, I found a paper in my master's hand. It\nmentioned fire in the forests. It mentioned rain. And it had on it words\nof power.\n\n\"For a time, I practiced the strange syllables. Many times did I speak\nthem aloud, then I pressed the bosses on the table, as shown by one of\nthe books. There was a light. Then, the great ball glowed with color, to\nshow me the first demon.\n\n\"He spoke. And I conquered my fear, to repeat the syllables I had\nlabored to learn. Once again, he spoke, and I could not understand him.\nI could think of nothing but to say again those words which I hoped\nwould bring the rain we so badly needed. I took my hands from the bosses\nand stood, wondering what would happen. The ball became dark.\n\n\"I stood, waiting. And nothing happened. Finally, thinking nothing was\nto occur, I turned and started to leave the room. Then, a great voice\nspoke. Again, the wall was alight. Within it was a fearsome demon who\nglared at me ferociously and demanded something in that tongue of power.\nI could not think. I stood, trembling fearfully. And he spoke again.\nThen did I repeat again the words I had learned, and ran from the room.\n\n\"It became dark. The lightnings flashed, and the rain fell, and my\nmaster came, but not as I had ever seen him before. He did not walk from\nthe forest as was his wont, but appeared before me from the air. I\nstarted back in fright, for now I was certain beyond doubt that he was a\nman of great wizardry. I thought he would beat me, or possibly cast me\nunder a spell.\n\n\"Never has he beaten me, always saying that it was wrong to beat an\napprentice, and that those who so did were lacking in their senses. And\nthis is but another proof of his sorcery, for who, other than a\nsorcerer, could handle his servants without beating them?\n\n\"I dared do nothing other than to tell him of my misdoing, and he\nrushed to the room, taking me with him. He pressed the bosses, turning\none that I had not known of, and the demon appeared again and talked\nwith him. Then, my master made strange passes about the instruments and\nthe village was shown in the ball.\n\n\"At last the rain stopped. A wind blew--hot and dry, as from the\npit--and the people came and did try by violence to enter. But they\ncould not. At last, the great machine came, and though we could not at\nfirst see it, we entered and were carried away through the sky.\n\n\"The people watched the house burn, then entered, to scatter the ashes.\n\n\"And I am here, and afraid.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nDoer Kweiros flipped off the playback and gazed at the unresponsive\nwall. He rubbed the back of his head, looked at the viewsphere, then\nchecked the playback index and tapped the rewind.\n\n\"Oh, me,\" he complained sorrowfully, \"how do we get into these things?\"\n\nHe looked toward the communicator controls unhappily, then reached out\nand dialed a number. The sphere lit and an alert face looked at him\ninquiringly.\n\n\"How is that Forell boy?\"\n\n\"Soaking up information like a sponge, sir.\"\n\nKweiros nodded. \"Gathered he might,\" he remarked. \"Send him up here,\nwill you? And have Jaeger come with him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nKweiros snapped the communicator off, sat back to drum idly on his desk,\nthen got up and walked over to his master file control board. He glanced\nat the index, then punched out a sequence on the buttons. There was a\nsubdued hum and a door opened. Kweiros reached into the compartment, to\ntake out several tape reels. He glanced at them, nodded, and went back\nto the desk, where he spread them out and looked from one to another.\nFinally, he selected one of the smaller reels and started to thread it\ninto the playback.\n\nThere was a light tap on the door and he looked up.\n\n\"So soon? Come in.\"\n\nA tall, sharp-featured guardsman entered and stood at attention. Beside\nhim was a boy, who looked curiously and a little fearfully at the\nofficer, who waved to chairs.\n\n\"Sit down, both of you. I'm not going to claw you. Just want to go over\na few things. I've some ideas, but I want to be sure of a couple of\npoints.\" The captain glanced at the reels before him.\n\n\"One thing puzzles me, Jaeger. Why did you have notes in the planetary\nlanguage in your communications room?\"\n\nJaeger stirred uneasily. \"I started doing that some time ago, sir,\" he\nexplained. \"You see, their language is quite dissimilar to either my own\nor to Galactica, and I have yet to learn to think in it. I wanted to\navoid any possibility of lapsing away from it, so I translated my\ninstructions and notes, hoping to keep myself constantly reminded to\nrefrain from using Galactica at any time.\" He spread his hands. \"I\nsuppose--\"\n\nKweiros waved. \"Logical, I presume,\" he admitted. \"Anyway, that's done,\nand we can't do much about it now. Now for another thing.\" He glanced at\nthe tape reels. \"I noticed that the villagers in your area regarded you\nas a sorcerer. What cause did they have to form such an opinion?\"\n\n\"None, sir, that I know of.\" Jaeger shook his head.\n\nKweiros looked at the boy. \"Elwar?\"\n\n\"Why, all the village knew it, Master.\" The boy shook his head. \"One had\nbut to be near Master Jaeger for a time, and he could feel the power,\njust as I can feel it now.\" He shook his head again. \"But it is very\nstrong, Master. You must be one of the ones of truly great power.\"\n\nKweiros looked speculatively at Jaeger.\n\n\"I understood they were nontelepaths. All the reports agree on that.\"\n\n\"Definitely, sir, they are. They're absolutely mute. Not a trace of\nradiation, even when they're close. And they don't receive. You can try\nit now, sir. It's just like punching into space itself. No resistance,\nno reflection, just nothing.\"\n\n\"Shield?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Just no indication. Makes me feel as though I were in free\nspace with a dead drive.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nKweiros looked for a moment at Jaeger, then sent out a probing thought,\nsearching for some indication of mental activity from the boy. But there\nwas nothing. It wasn't anything like a shield, he thought. It seemed\nmore like an infinite baffle.\n\nBut there was some reaction. The boy shrank back in terror.\n\n\"Please, Master,\" he begged. \"Do not place me under enchantment.\" He\nheld up his hands in a peculiar gesture.\n\n\"What made you do that?\" Kweiros raised a hand slowly, palm out. \"I have\nno intention of harming you.\"\n\n\"But I could feel you, trying to cast me under a spell.\"\n\n\"You ... felt me?\"\n\n\"To be sure, Master, just as I have felt the same power from my master,\nJaeger. But this was far stronger. It hurt. And it seemed as though you\nwanted me to do something.\"\n\nKweiros nodded. \"I think I'm getting an idea,\" he remarked. \"And it\nscares me a little. They're not really nontelepathic, any more than the\nKierawelans, for example, are nonvocal. I think we've got something here\nthat's almost unique in the galaxy.\" He rubbed his neck. \"Excuse me a\nfew minutes. I want to check something in one of these tapes.\"\n\nJaeger nodded and leaned back in his chair, looking curiously at the boy\nbeside him, then back at his superior, who had selected a tape reel. He\nthreaded it into the playing heads, put on a headband, and snapped a\nswitch. Jaeger and the boy watched as Kweiros leaned back.\n\nThe officer's face became vacant, then twisted, seeming to reflect\npainful mental effort. Slowly, he leaned forward again, touching another\nswitch. Then, he sank back, to concentrate on his thoughts.\n\nJaeger looked again at the boy, who was sitting tensely, his hands\ngripping the arms of his chair, his eyes fastened fearfully on the\nofficer before him. As Jaeger watched, Elwar half rose from his chair,\nthen sank back, his face appearing to mirror Kweiros' efforts.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt last, Kweiros sat up. Shakily, he removed his headband and snapped\nthe playback off.\n\n\"Long time since I checked that tape,\" he said. \"Pretty rugged stuff,\nand highly speculative. Always gives me a headache.\" He shook his head\nas he looked at Elwar.\n\n\"And this makes it even worse. It was bad enough as pure speculation,\nbut we've got something real here. Something rough. For one thing, we\nhave got a planet where no one but native operatives stand a chance of\nworking. For another we--\" He cupped his chin in his hands and examined\nElwar closely.\n\n\"Do you really want to learn the secrets you looked for in the books,\nyoungster? Do you still want the secrets you first thought you might\nlearn?\"\n\nThe boy seemed to withdraw a little. \"I have a great fear,\" he admitted\ntremulously.\n\n\"You haven't been injured or mistreated, have you?\"\n\n\"No, Master, but--\" Elwar looked toward the door.\n\n\"And you won't be,\" he was told reassuringly. \"Now you just go ahead on\nback to your quarters.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nAs the door closed, Kweiros turned to Jaeger.\n\n\"Think we'll put you on special assignment. For the next few cycles,\nyou'll act as a private tutor. Then you can go back to Main Base with\nElwar while they give him his training.\"\n\nJaeger raised his eyebrows. \"Yes, sir,\" he said doubtfully. \"You think\nthe boy will develop?\"\n\nKweiros nodded. \"I'm quite sure of it,\" he said. \"And he's got a big job\nahead of him. He may be instrumental in preventing a major disaster.\" He\nwaved at the tape reels.\n\n\"I got that little tape out just on an off chance,\" he added. \"Didn't\nreally expect to find anything, but--\" He flipped his hands out.\n\"Anyway, I pulled it.\" He leaned forward, looking at Jaeger.\n\n\"We may have run into a second, or even third growth culture,\" he said\nslowly. \"Once, before some ancient war of destruction, the people of\nthis planet might have been normally telepathic.\" He closed his eyes for\nan instant. \"Possibly they were unable to use their telepathic power.\nAnd equally possibly, they could have had a highly developed mechanical\ncivilization. Something went wrong.\" He waved at the tape reel.\n\n\"In this reconstruction, there's an hypothesis on just such a situation.\nHere, a race reaches high development and wrecks itself--leaving no\ntrace of its accomplishments. Growth starts over from the most meager of\nbeginnings. Survival becomes a matter of the most bitter conflict, with\neveryone becoming a hunter and being hunted in his turn. In this\nsituation, detection of an enemy becomes vital.\" He grinned wryly. \"Can\nyou imagine what would happen to someone who radiated his thoughts?\"\n\nJaeger ran a finger over his lips. \"He'd be easy to locate,\" he mused.\n\"And he'd have a hard time evading an enemy.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" Kweiros nodded. \"And he'd never be able to approach his\nprey. In short, he'd fail to survive. Complete telepathic blankness\nwould have a high survival value. But an ability to detect mental\nradiation would still be a big help.\" He waved a hand.\n\n\"So, a race like this one could evolve. And the author of this tape\nextrapolated from there. A normal telepathic reception will be\naccompanied, by a slight feedback. A completely black body, however,\nwill neither radiate nor feed back. It merely absorbs energy and, unless\nit's super-imposed on a reflective background, it leaves no trace. Since\nnothing in nature other than a telepathic mind can reflect telepathy, no\nbackground would survive for long.\" He frowned a little.\n\n\"Of course, no mind we are familiar with could act as a telepathically\nblack body, but this author hypothesized a race that could do just\nthat--plus. There's a further hypothesis of an ability to detect and\nlocalize radiations as such, without bothering to resolve them.\"\n\n\"Sounds like just what we have here,\" Jaeger admitted.\n\n\"It does, doesn't it?\" Kweiros nodded. \"And there's a further\nextrapolation. Some of the members or the elder races have speculated on\na sort of second-order telepathy, undetectable to the normal telepath,\nbut capable of noting normal radiation. And some of the speculations\nseem to make sense--though they're a little confusing. If you don't have\na specific sense, it's difficult to visualize it, or even to speculate\non its presence.\" He drew a deep breath.\n\n\"That leads us into a real problem. Our people roamed around this planet\nfor several cycles this time. And there may have been others before us,\nwho didn't record their visits, other than in the minds and legends of\nthe natives. And there may be other legends from that other, older\nculture.\" He shrugged.\n\n\"We picked up what we could on the culture, but we didn't get the full\nstory on them. And we've probably left a thousand legends behind us,\nincluding that beautiful mess at your station.\" He grinned.\n\n\"Right now, their folklore is loaded with sorcerers, warlocks, wizards,\nand what not. After all, whatever their past is, they're primitive now.\nSo those stories are going to grow and continue. Eventually, long before\nthey really develop a stabilized ethic, someone's going to collate that\nwhole mess. And do you know what he'll come up with?\"\n\n\"Us?\"\n\n\"Us, yes. Us, in a distorted form.\" Kweiros nodded emphatically. \"They\nwill come to a full realization that there are advanced entities running\naround the cosmos, entities that have all kinds of mysterious powers.\nAnd they'll invent still more powers and characteristics--mostly bad.\"\nHe spread his hands, then laid them on the desk in front of him.\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"That way, they could develop a hopeless, planet-wide trauma--a sort of\nsuper inferiority complex--and they could contract on themselves, devote\ntheir time to an intensive study of demonology, and very possibly come\napart at the seams.\n\n\"Or, they could do something else. I was watching Elwar while I was\nchecking that tape. Did you notice anything peculiar?\"\n\n\"He seemed disturbed.\"\n\n\"As though he were sensing my thoughts?\"\n\n\"Something like that. But--\"\n\nKweiros nodded. \"But I had a shield up. You could detect no trace of\nmental action. Right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought.\" Kweiros shook his head and looked closely at\nJaeger.\n\n\"Can you imagine,\" he added, \"a primitive race with the power to detect\na galactic by his thoughts? And can you imagine that power developing\nuntil that detection is possible at interstellar ranges, with members\nof that race being able to pick up faint impressions from received\nthoughts--distorted impressions? And can you imagine that same race,\nignorant of the humanic equations, devoid of a stable ethic,\nsuperstitious, distrustful and fearful of advanced entities? They would\nbe undetectable by normal telepathic means, you know. And suppose they\nwere disposed to destroy what they could not understand.\" He frowned.\n\nJaeger looked back at him, his eyes becoming wide. Suddenly, his gaze\ndefocused and he looked aside, to stare unseeingly at the floor.\n\n\"Something's got to be done, sir,\" he said reluctantly.\n\nKweiros nodded. \"Something's got to be done,\" he agreed. \"Of course,\nthere's another side to the picture. If this race develops and learns,\nthey'll be just as valuable to the galaxy as they would otherwise be\ndangerous.\" He looked toward the door.\n\n\"And our boy out there is one of the few who can help in this situation.\nHe's going to have to work out counter stories--amusing stories--about\nall those magical creatures his people tell about. He's going to have to\nhint at the possibilities of close co-ordination and co-operation\nbetween members of his own species. And he's going to have to suggest\nthe possibility of friendly co-operation between his species and\nothers.\" He drew a deep breath.\n\n\"And he's going to have to do all this without taking any risk of\nexposing the existence of other, more advanced species in the galaxy.\"\nHe brushed a hand across his head, then pressed the back of his neck,\nkneading the skin.\n\n\"These stories of his, he'll have to publish. He'll have to get them\ncirculated all over his planet, if he can. Possibly we can give him some\nindirect help, but he's going to have to carry a good share of the load.\n\n\"He knows his own people as we could never hope to. And he'll have to be\nthoroughly educated, so he can say what he wants to. And he'll have to\nbe fully aware of the humanic equations and all their connotations. If\nhe's to have any direct help, he'll have to choose his helpers from\namong his own people, and he'll have to choose carefully.\" Kweiros\nthrust at his temple with the heel of a hand, then shook his head\nviolently.\n\n\"Somehow, he's going to have to accentuate any legends he may be able to\nfind which present a favorable light on co-ordination and co-operation,\nand he'll have to invent more. And all those other legends--the ones\nwhich treat of superstition and destructive force--will have to be\nreduced to the realm of the storybook, submerged under a layer of amused\ncondemnation, and kept there. All these things, that youngster is going\nto have to do.\n\n\"It's your job to help teach him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForell watched his friend closely as the critic laid aside the last\npage.\n\nAndorra sat for a moment, his head cocked in thought. Then, he picked up\nthe last page and looked at it again. Finally, he laid the sheet aside.\nHe looked at his friend with a wry smile, then picked up his wineglass,\nlooking at it quizzically.\n\n\"Do you always give your own name to one of your characters?\"\n\nForell's grip tightened on the small object in his hand.\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" he said. \"Gives me a better identification. If I can get\ninto the story, it's easier to draw the reader in.\" He forced a casual\nsmile. \"I'll change that name later, of course.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean.\" Andorra sipped from his glass.\n\n\"You know,\" he added, \"a couple of hours ago, I was almost ready to get\nexcited about the idea of a cosmos full of super beings. And I even\nmight have dreamed up something like this myself--and more than half\nbelieved it.\" He shook his head.\n\n\"But when a fantasist like yourself comes up with it, and makes it look\nso nicely possible, the idea almost looks foolish. After all, Elwar, if\nyou actually were the guy in that little sketch of yours, you'd hardly\nbe asking me to read it, now would you?\" He looked down at the papers,\nthen raised his head again, frowning.\n\n\"'He'll have to choose his helpers from among his own people,'\" he\nquoted. \"'All these things, that youngster is going to have to do.'\" He\nsipped again from his glass, keeping a searching gaze on his friend.\n\n\"And on the other hand, if your story here should be true, you just\nmight be asking me to read it, for one reason or another.\" He raised his\nglass, examining the bright liquid within it.\n\nElwar tensed, his hand coming part way out of his pocket.\n\nSuddenly, Andorra set the glass down and leaned forward, hands gripping\nhis knees.\n\n\"Tell me, Elwar,\" he begged, \"this isn't a hoax, is it? Surely, no one\ncould be so warped as to present a friend with something like this and\nthen to laugh it off?\"\n\nForell drew a deep breath and examined his companion closely. At last,\nhis left hand relaxed a little.\n\n\"It's no hoax,\" he admitted.\n\nAndorra sighed and leaned back.\n\n\"And you can use help? You're asking me?\"\n\nHe paused, waiting as Forell nodded, then spread his hands.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"it shouldn't take me too long to fix it so I would\nnot be missed too much for a few years.\" He looked at the wall.\n\n\"It must be quite a training course.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ January\n    1956.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
