Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n[Sidenote: Man, it would appear, can adapt to any form of society ...\nbut not one in which the knowledge of extending life becomes a passport\nto death!]\n\n\nThe door-knob turned, then rattled.\n\nDr. David Wong stepped out from behind the large bookcase, listening. He\npressed the brass handle of the top shelf and the case silently pivoted\nback to become part of the wall, obliterating the dark passage behind\nit.\n\nAn imperative knocking began at the door; David walked softly to his\ndesk and picked up his notebook. He tried to remain relaxed, but he\ncould feel the tightening of his shoulder muscles. With his right hand,\nhe shut his notebook and concealed it under a mass of papers, while his\nleft hand pressed the desk button to release the lock of the door.\n\nThe door burst open and two men strode in, a black-uniformed Ruler\nfollowed by a watchguard. Black-visored cap still on his head, the first\nman marched to the desk and spoke without ceremonial greeting.\n\n\"The door was locked, Dr. Wong?\"\n\n\"Correct, Dr. Lanza. The door was locked.\"\n\n\"I shall have to instruct the guard to report it. Have you forgotten\nLeader Marley's Maxim: Constructive science does not skulk behind locked\ndoors?\"\n\nWong leaned back in his chair and smiled at his visitors.\n\n\"The wisdom of Leader Marley is a constant help to us all, but his\ngenerosity is also a byword. Surely you remember that on the tenth\nanniversary of his accession, he honored me by the grant of occasional\nhours of Privacy, as a reward for my work on Blue Martian Fever?\"\n\n\"I remember now,\" said Dr. Lanza.\n\n\"But what for?\" asked Officer Blagun. \"It's anti-social!\"\n\n\"Evidently you have forgotten, Officer Blagun, another Maxim of Leader\nMarley: Nature has not equipped one Category to judge the needs of\nanother; only the Leader understands all. Now, Dr. Lanza, will you tell\nme the reason for this visit? Since your promotion from Research to\nRuler, I have rarely been honored by your attention.\"\n\n\"I am here with a message,\" said Lanza. \"Leader Marley's compliments,\nand he requests your presence at a conference on next Wednesday at ten\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"Why did you have to deliver that in person? What's wrong with using\nCommunications?\"\n\n\"It's not my province to ask questions, Dr. Wong. I was told to come\nhere, and I was told to wait for a reply.\"\n\n\"Next Wednesday at ten? Let's see, this is Friday.\" David Wong pressed\nthe key of his electronic calendar, but he had no need to study the dull\ngreen and red lights that flashed on to indicate the pattern of his day.\nHe did not delude himself that he had any real choice, but he had\nlearned in the past fifteen years that it kept up his courage to\npreserve at least the forms of independence. He allowed a decent thirty\nseconds to ponder the coded lights, then blanked the board and looked up\nwith an easy smile.\n\n\"Dr. Wong's compliments to Leader Marley, and he will be honored to\nattend a conference on Wednesday at ten.\"\n\nNodding his head, Dr. Lanza glanced briefly around the office. \"Queer,\nold-fashioned place you have here.\"\n\n\"Yes. It was built many years ago by a slippery old politician who\nwanted to be safe from his enemies. Makes a good place for Research,\ndon't you think?\"\n\nLanza did not answer. He strode to the door, then paused to look back.\n\n\"You understand, Dr. Wong, that I shall have to report the locked door?\nI have no choice.\"\n\n\"Has anyone?\"\n\nOfficer Blagun followed his superior, leaving the door wide open behind\nthem. Wong remained rigid in his chair until the clack of heels on\nmarble floor had become a mere echo in his brain, then stretched out his\nhand to the intercom. He observed with pride that his hand did not\ntremble as he pressed the dial.\n\n\"Get me Dr. Karl Haslam ... Karl? Can you meet me in the lab right away?\nI've thought of a new approach that might help us crack the White\nMartian problem. Yes, I know we planned on conferring tomorrow, but it's\ngetting later than you think.\"\n\nAgain he pressed the dial. \"Get me Leah Hachovnik. Leah? I've got some\nnew stuff to dictate. Be a good girl and come along right away.\"\n\nBreaking the connection, he drew out his notebook and opened it.\n\nDavid Wong was a big man, tall, well-muscled, compact, and he might have\nbeen handsome but for a vague something in his appearance. His lean face\nand upcurving mouth were those of a young man; his hair was a glossy\nblack, too thick to be disciplined into neatness; and he was\nwell-dressed, except for the unfashionable bulging of his jacket pocket,\nwhere he carried a bulky leather case of everfeed pens and notebooks.\nBut it was his eyes that were disconcerting--an intense blue, brilliant\nand direct, they had a wisdom and a comprehension that seemed\nincongruous in so young a face.\n\nA worried frown creased his forehead as he turned back to one of the\nfirst pages, studying the symbols he had recorded there, but he looked\nup without expression on hearing the tapping of slender heels.\n\n\"Quick work, Leah. How are you this morning?\"\n\n\"As if anybody cared!\" Leah Hachovnik settled down before the compact\nstenograph machine, her shoulders slumped, her thin mouth drooping at\nthe corners.\n\n\"Feel like working?\" said David.\n\n\"As much as I ever do, I guess. Sometimes I wonder if the traitors in\nthe granite quarries have it any worse than I do. Sometimes I wish I'd\nbeen born into some other Category. Other people have all the luck. I\ndon't know what it is, Dr. Wong, but I just don't seem to have the pep I\nused to have. Do you think it could be the climate here in New York?\"\n\n\"People do grow older, Leah,\" he reminded her gently.\n\n\"I know. But Tanya--you remember my twin sister Tanya, the one that got\nso sick that time, ten years ago, when you did that experiment with Blue\nMartian Fever, and she had to be sent out to Arizona? Of course I\nhaven't ever seen her since then--people in Office Category never get\npermission for that kind of travel--but she writes me that ever since\nshe got well again she feels just like a kid, and works as hard as she\never did, and she still seems to enjoy life. Why, she's had three\nproposals of marriage this past year alone, she says, and yet she's\nthirty-five, just the same age as I am--being twins, you know?--and\nnobody's proposed to me in ages. Well, I'm certainly going to try to\nfind out what her method is. She's coming back tomorrow.\"\n\n\"She's _what_?\"\n\n\"Coming back. BureauMed is sending her back here to the Institute to\ntake up her old job in Intercom. Funny they haven't told you, her being\nan old employee and all.\"\n\nDr. Wong was gripping his notebook in stiff fingers, but he replied\neasily, \"Oh, well, BureauMed is a complex organization. With all they\nhave to do, it's not surprising they get things mixed up sometimes.\"\n\n\"Don't I know!\" she sighed, and droned on in a dreary monotone. \"This\none institute alone would turn your hair gray before your time. I don't\nknow how some people seem to keep so young. I was just thinking to\nmyself this morning when I watched you walking through the office, 'Why,\nDr. Wong doesn't seem to age a bit! He looks just as young as he ever\ndid, and look at me!'\"\n\nLooking at her, David admitted to himself, was not the pleasure it had\nonce been. Ten years ago, she and her twin sister Tanya had been plump,\ndelectable, kittenish girls, their mental equipment no more than\nstandard for Office Category, of course, but their physical appearance\nhad been outstanding, almost beautiful enough for Theater Category.\nCreamy ivory skin, gray eyes, and soft red hair dramatized by a freakish\nstreak of white that shot abruptly back from the center of the forehead,\nTanya's swirling to the left, and Leah's to the right, one girl the\nmirror image of the other.\n\nBut the Leah sitting before him now was thin and tired-looking, her\nsallow skin was lined, and her soft voice had become vinegary with\ndisappointments. Her red hair had faded to a commonplace brown, and the\nwhite streak in the center was yellowed. An unwanted, souring old maid.\nBut there was only one response to make.\n\n\"You look fine to me, Leah,\" he said. \"What time did you say your sister\nis coming?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow evenings' Playground Jet. Why?\"\n\n\"We'll have to think of a way to celebrate. But right now, I'd like to\nget started on my new paper. I've got to meet Dr. Haslam before long.\"\n\n\"I know.\" She raised her faded gray eyes. \"That was a funny thing you\nsaid to him just now over the intercom. You said to him it was getting\nlate. But it isn't late. It's only eleven o'clock in the morning.\"\n\nDavid stared. \"Do you mean to say you were listening to our\nconversation? Why did you do that?\"\n\nShe fidgeted and turned away from him. \"Oh, I just happened to be at\nComdesk and I guess the circuit wasn't closed. Does it matter? But it\nseemed a funny thing for you to say.\"\n\n\"People in Office Category are not supposed to understand Research,\" he\nsaid severely. \"If they were capable of Research, Leader Marley's\nplanners would have placed them there. As for its being late, it is, as\nfar as White Martian Fever is concerned. Which is the subject of my\npaper. Prepare to take dictation.\"\n\nShrugging her shoulders, she poised her bony fingers over the keys of\nthe little machine.\n\n\"Paper for delivery at the Summer Seminar,\" he began.\n\n\"But, Dr. Wong, that doesn't have to be ready for three months yet!\"\n\n\"Miss Hachovnik! Please remember Leader Marley's Maxim: Individuals born\ninto Office Category are the bone and muscle of the State; Nature has\ndesigned them to act, not to think.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Wong. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Leah. We're old friends, so I won't report you. All set?\"\n\nHe took a pencil from his leather case and tapped it against his\nnotebook as he ruffled the pages, wondering how to begin. It was hard to\nthink logically when a part of his mind was in such confusion. Had Leah\nbeen listening in to all of his phone conversations? If so, it was\nfortunate that he had long ago devised an emergency code. Was it only\nidle curiosity that had prompted her or was she acting under orders? Was\nanyone else watching him, he wondered, listening to his talk, perhaps\neven checking the routine of his experimental work? There was Lanza this\nmorning--why had he come unannounced, in person, when a Communications\ncall would have served the purpose equally well?\n\nLeah's voice broke in. \"I'm ready, Dr. Wong.\"\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"...the Summer Seminar. Title: The Propogation of\nWhite Martian virus. Paragraph. It will be remembered that the early\nattempts to establish Earth colonies on Mars were frustrated by the\nextreme susceptibility of our people to two viruses native to the\nforeign planet, viruses which we designate as Blue Martian and White\nMartian, according to the two distinct types of fever which they cause.\nBlue Martian Fever in the early days caused a mortality among our\ncolonists of nearly eighty-five per cent, and made the establishment of\npermanent colonies a virtual impossibility.\n\n\"Under the inspired leadership of Leader Marley and with the advice of\nhis deputy Dr. Lanza, this laboratory in Research worked out a method of\ngrowing the virus and producing an immunizing agent which is effective\nin nearly all human beings. Only the cooperation of several Categories\nmade possible such a feat. It will not be forgotten that even the\nhumblest helpers in the Institute had their share in the project, that\nsome of them acted as human volunteers in the experiments, well knowing\nthe risks they ran, and were afterward rewarded by a Free Choice.\n\n\"One person in Office Category, for instance, was given the privilege of\nlearning to play the flute, although nobody in his family had ever\nbelonged to Music, and another person in Menial Category was permitted a\nmonth's study of elementary algebra, a nearly unheard of indulgence for\na person in his position. But as Leader Marley so graciously remarked in\nconferring the awards: To the individual who risks much, the State gives\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Like me and Tanya?\" the girl asked, stopping her typing.\n\n\"Yes, like you and Tanya. You were allowed to act a part in an amateur\nTheater group, I remember, and since Tanya was made too ill to be able\nto use a Free Choice, she was sent out west to the Playground, just as\nthough she had belonged to Ruler Category. Now where was I?\"\n\n\"'The State gives much.'\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Paragraph. Since the discovery of the immunizing mechanism to\nBlue Martian, permanent colonies have been established on Mars. But\nthere remains the more elusive problem of White Martian Fever, which,\nthough its mortality is only thirty per cent, is still so crippling to\nthose victims who survive that the Martian colonies cannot begin to\nexpand, and the resources of the planet cannot be fully developed, until\nan immunizing agent is found.\n\n\"For the past eight years this laboratory has been working at the\nproblem, among others, and we are now in a position to report a small\ndegree of progress. Since it proved to be impossible to grow the virus\nin the usual media, it occurred to us--\"\n\nThe intercom buzzed, and Dr. Wong turned away to open the dial.\n\n\"David? What's happened to you? I've been waiting here in the lab a\nquarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Karl. I thought I had more time. Be right down.\"\n\nHe reached for his white lab coat and shoved his long arms into the\nstarched sleeves. \"That's all we have time for now, Leah. Can you get an\nearly lunch and be back here this afternoon at two?\"\n\nBut she was not listening. She was leaning over to look at the desk,\nstaring avidly at the open pages of Dr. Wong's notebook. Without comment\nhe picked up the book, closed it, put it in the top drawer and locked\nthe drawer. She watched him with curious eyes.\n\n\"What funny marks those were, Dr. Wong! Do you keep your notes in a\nprivate system of shorthand?\"\n\n\"No. I write them in Coptic. For the sake of privacy.\"\n\n\"What's Coptic?\"\n\n\"A dead language, spoken by the ancient Egyptians thirty or forty\ncenturies ago.\"\n\n\"But you're Research, not Linguistics! It's against the law for you to\nknow other languages. Are you a traitor?\"\n\n\"My dear Leah,\" he said, \"I'm far too sensible a man to go in for\nbootleg study, to learn anything without permission. I have no wish to\nend up with a pick-ax in my hands. But you shouldn't tax your little\nmind with thinking. It's not your job. You're not equipped for it, and\nit's dangerous.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid passed the watchguard stationed in the basement corridor, walked\nthrough the open door of the laboratory, past the bench where a row of\npretty technicians sat making serial dilutions of bacterial and virus\nsuspensions, through the glow of the sterilizing room, and on into the\nsmall inner lab where flasks of culture media and developing hens' eggs\nsat in a transparent incubator, and petri dishes flecked with spots of\ncolor awaited his inspection.\n\nDr. Karl Haslam was standing at the work bench, with a pair of silver\nforceps which held a small egg under the psi light. Gently he lowered\nthe egg into its warm observation chamber, covered the container, and\nsat down.\n\n\"Well, here I am. What's gone wrong? Explain yourself, my boy.\"\n\n\"Just a minute.\" Grinning maliciously, David took down a bottle from the\nshelf of chemicals, poured a colorless liquid into a beaker, and walked\ncasually toward the doorway as he agitated the mixture of hydrogen\nsulphide and mercaptans. He held his breath, then coughed, when the\nfumes of putrescence filled the room and drifted out the door. He looked\ninto the technician's room.\n\n\"Sorry for the aroma, girls, but this is a vital experiment.\"\n\n\"Can't you at least shut the door?\" one called pleadingly.\n\n\"Explain to the watchguard out there, will you?\" Closing the door, he\nturned on the ventilator and sat down beside Dr. Haslam.\n\n\"Why all the melodrama?\" Karl asked, baffled. \"First you call me by\nemergency code, then you hole in like a conspirator. I'm beginning to\nthink you're a great loss to Theater. What's happened? Why is it later\nthan I think?\"\n\n\"Do you take everything as a joke, Karl?\"\n\n\"Certainly, until I'm forced to do otherwise. What's worrying you?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid of being arrested for treason. Don't laugh! This morning I\nreceived a message, delivered in person by our old schoolmate Lanza, to\nreport to Leader Marley on Wednesday, and Marley hasn't paid any\nattention to me since he last inspected our lab, years ago. For another\nthing, Leah Hachovnik is making a nuisance of herself with her curiosity\nabout my affairs. If she weren't so clumsy about her prying, I'd almost\nbelieve she was under orders to spy on me.\"\n\nKarl moved impatiently. \"I hope you're not turning psychotic. You have a\nclean record of continuous production and you've never mixed in\npolitics. You've never expressed what you may really think of our Leader\neven to me, although we've been friends since we were in Medschool, and\nI hope you never will. And you're making progress with White Martian.\nWhy, my boy, you're all set! What's treasonable about that?\"\n\nSomeone knocked at the door. Hastily David uncovered the fragrant beaker\nand waved it about as he called, \"Come in!\"\n\nThe watchguard looked in for an instant, wrinkled his nose, and quickly\nshut the door. Laughing, David covered the beaker, and began walking\nabout with long nervous strides, snapping his fingers as he tried to\nexplain.\n\n\"I'm in trouble, Karl. I've run into something I don't know how to deal\nwith, and I need help, I need advice, I need cooperation. I've lived\nalone with this thing for ten long years, hoping month after month that\nsomething would turn up so I could evade the issue. But nothing has. And\nnow there's going to be a showdown.\"\n\nKarl touched his arm sympathetically. \"My dear boy--\"\n\n\"_That's it!_\" shouted David.\n\n\"What's what?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm trying to tell you. Why do you always call me your\n'dear boy?' You know I'm a year older than you are.\"\n\n\"It's just habit, I suppose. You _look_ so young--your hair is black,\nwhile mine is nearly white. You're full of vigor, while I begin to creak\nwith middle age. I didn't realize that I irritated you with my little\nphrase. I should think you'd be pleased that you have somehow managed to\nsip at the fountain of youth.\"\n\nDavid sank down on a stool. \"I'm not pleased. I'm terrified.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that's exactly what's happened. I have sipped at the fountain of\nyouth. I've discovered how to keep people from growing old. I myself\nhave not aged a bit in the last ten years.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Karl sat unmoving, his face like stone.\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" he said at last.\n\n\"It's no longer a question of belief. In a few days everybody will know,\nthe proof will stare you in the face. And what will happen then?\"\n\n\"Evidence?\" Karl asked. \"I can't accept a statement as a fact.\"\n\n\"Would you like to see my mice? Come with me.\"\n\nDavid Wong hurried into the small animal room and paused before a stack\nof wire cages in which furry creatures darted and squeaked.\n\n\"You remember when we were working on Blue Martian, those peculiar\nmutants we found in our mice, and how I used six of them in trying to\nmake antibodies to the virus?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Karl. \"They were spotted with tufts of white hair on\nthe right forelegs.\"\n\nDavid took down a cage, thrust in his hand, and brought out two of the\ntiny black mice which crawled over his trembling hand. Their right\nforelegs bore tufts of long white hair.\n\n\"These,\" he said, \"are the same mice.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Their descendants, you mean. Mice don't live that long.\"\n\n\"_These_ mice do. And they'll go on living. For years I've lived in fear\nthat someone would notice and suspect the truth. Just as for years,\nevery time someone has laughed and told me I never seemed to age a day,\nI've been terrified that he might guess the truth. I'm _not_ aging.\"\n\nKarl looked dazed. \"Well, my boy, you've got a bear by the tail. How did\nyou find the elixir or whatever it is?\"\n\n\"You remember the early work with radioactive tracers, a couple of\nhundred years ago, that proved that all our body cells are in a\ncontinuous state of flux? There's a dynamic equilibrium between the\ndisintegration and the resynthesis of the essential factors such as\nproteins, fats and amino groups, but the cell directs all the incoming\nmaterial into the right chemical structures, under the influence of some\norganizing power which resides in the cell.\n\n\"Foreign influences like viruses may disrupt this order and cause\ncancer. The cells are continually in a state of change, but always\nreplace their characteristic molecules, and it is only as they grow\nolder that they gradually become 'worn out.' Then the body grows old,\nbecomes less resistant to infection, and eventually succumbs to one\ndisease or another. And you know, of course, that viruses also have this\nself-duplicating ability.\n\n\"I reasoned that at birth a man had a definite, finite amount of this\nessential self-duplicating entity--SDE--in his body cells, a kind of\ndirecting factor which reproduces itself, but more slowly than do the\nbody cells. In that case, with the normal multiplication of the cells,\nthe amount of SDE per cell would slowly but surely grow smaller with the\nyears. Eventually the time would come when the percentage would be below\nthe critical level--the cells would be less resistant, would function\nwith less efficiency, and the man would 'grow old.'\"\n\nKarl nodded soberly. \"Reasonable hypothesis.\"\n\n\"But one day, by pure chance, I isolated a component which I recognized\nas being the factor essential to the normal functioning of body cells.\nIt hit me like a toothache. I found that I could synthesize the SDE in\nthe lab, and the only problem then was to get it into a man's cells. If\nI could do that, keep the SDE level up to that of youth, a man would\nstop aging! Since viruses penetrate our cells when they infect us, it\nwas no trick at all to effect a chemical coupling of the SDE to the\nvirus. I used Martian Blue, since it was handy, and its effects are\nusually brief.\n\n\"Presto! Old age is held at bay for another twenty or thirty years--I\nreally don't know how long. These mice were my first experiment, and as\nyou see, they're still alive. Next, I tried it on myself.\"\n\nDavid put the mice back in their cage, locked it, and returned to the\nlab.\n\n\"Tomorrow, the whole thing is bound to come out because Tanya Hachovnik\nis coming back. You know her sister Leah--gray, dried-up, soured on\nlife. Well, I've had ways of checking, and when Tanya Hachovnik walks\ninto the Institute, everyone will see her as the same luscious redhead\nof twenty-five we knew ten years ago. I realize that what I did was a\ncriminal act. I didn't think the thing through or I wouldn't have been\nsuch a fool. But when I made those final experiments, I used the\nHachovnik twins for a controlled pair.\"\n\n\"You must have been crazy!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I was. I'd tried it on myself, of course, with no bad effects\nexcept a few days' fever, but I realized that without a control I never\ncould be sure the SDE was actually working. It might be just that my\nparticular genetic constitution caused me to age more slowly than the\naverage. So I chose the twins. To Leah I gave the attenuated Martian\nBlue, but to Tanya I gave the simple Blue coupled with SDE. The\nexperiment worked. Identical twins--one grows old like other people; the\nother remains young. I know now, Karl, how to prolong youth\nindefinitely. But what in the name of Leader Marley shall I do with my\nknowledge?\"\n\nKarl Haslam absently twisted his white hair and spoke slowly, as though\nhe found trouble in choosing his words.\n\n\"You realize, of course, that it is your duty to acquaint Leader Marley\nwith all the details of your discovery?\"\n\n\"Is it? Can you imagine what this will do to our society? What about the\ngenerations of children coming into a world where no places have been\nvacated for them by death? What about the struggles for power? Who will\ndecide, and on what basis, whether to confer or to withhold this gift?\nThere'll be riots, civil wars. I know that I'm only a scientist; all I\never wanted from life was to be left alone, in a peaceful laboratory,\nand let other people worry about the world and its troubles. But\nnow--don't you see that by the mere fact that I made this discovery,\nI've lost the right to sit by quietly and let other people make the\ndecisions?\"\n\n\"But, David, you and I aren't able to handle such a problem! We're only\nResearch!\"\n\n\"I know. We're inadequate, yet we have the responsibility. The men who\ncreated atomic power probably felt inadequate, too, but could they have\nmade as bad a mess of handling it as others did? Suppose I did turn this\nover to Marley--he'd use it to become the most absolute tyrant in the\nhistory of the race.\"\n\nKarl ran his fingers through his hair and smiled crookedly. \"Well, you\ncould always start a revolution, I suppose, and start by assassinating\nthe Leader.\"\n\n\"With what kind of weapon? Men like you and me are not allowed to own so\nmuch as an old-fashioned pistol. Except for the Military, Marley's the\nonly man allowed to wear a Needler. And, besides, I'm a Research, not a\nMilitary. I hate violence and I'm naturally conditioned against\nkilling.\"\n\n\"Then you shouldn't have got into this mess. It would have been far\nbetter never to have discovered this SDE. I presume your notes are\nsafely locked up, by the way?\"\n\nDavid grinned. \"Don't worry about my notes; they're written in Coptic.\nYou remember when I was still in Medschool and made my first important\ndiscovery, how to prevent the development of hereditary baldness by the\ninjection of certain parahormones? Leader Marley rewarded me with a Free\nChoice, and I chose to learn a dead language. Not half a dozen men in\nthe world could read my notes.\"\n\n\"If your notes are safe, why don't you just destroy your mice and get\nrid of your proof that way?\"\n\n\"And the Hachovnik twins?\"\n\n\"You could at least keep Tanya out of sight.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool. That would only be a temporary measure and has nothing\nto do with the real problem. Lanza and Marley may suspect the truth\nright now, for all I know; they keep such close watch on my work.\nAnyway, the secret is bound to come out sooner or later.\"\n\nDr. Haslam clasped his hands and stared at them for a long while. His\nlined face looked grayer than ever.\n\nHe looked up at last with a faint smile. \"Well, my boy, I never asked\nyou to discover this stuff, but since you have--I hereby burn my\nbridges! You're right, we can't give it to Marley. But you can't handle\nit alone. What we need is time, and we haven't got it. We shall both be\nliquidated before this is over, there's no doubt of that, but we must do\nwhat we can. When is Tanya arriving?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow night, on the Playground Jet.\"\n\n\"And you see Leader Marley when?\"\n\n\"Next Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Five days yet. Then this is what we'll do. Too bad Lanza is in the\nother camp, but there's you and me, and I think Hudson and Faur\u00e9 from\nSerology will come in with us. We'll need others--sociologists,\nanthropologists, psychologists--the most promising material from all\nCategories if we're to create a new society based on the prospect of\nimmortality. But I'll see the first two and bring them to your apartment\ntomorrow night for Tanya's welcome-home party. I leave it to you to\nmuzzle Leah.\"\n\n\"That won't do,\" said David. \"I don't have a current Free Choice.\"\n\n\"But I have. Two, as a matter of fact, a reward for curing the insomnia\nof Leader Marley's wife. I choose to give a party, I choose tomorrow\nnight, and I choose your apartment.\"\n\nA knock rattled the door, and the watchguard thrust in his head. \"How\nmuch longer is this here experiment going to take? Do you guys want to\nbe reported?\"\n\n\"Just finishing, Officer,\" called Karl. \"You can leave the door open\nnow.\"\n\n\"What a stink!\" said the guard. \"Thank God I'm in Military!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt hardly seemed like a party, David thought. His guests were ill at\nease, and their conversation labored, then stopped altogether when the\nMenial came into the library with a tray of glasses and niblets.\n\n\"Put them on the liquor cabinet, James,\" said David. \"And that will be\nall. Enjoy yourself tonight.\"\n\nThe Menial put down the tray and then stooped to fumble with the lock.\n\n\"Let that alone! I've told you a thousand times not to monkey with my\nliquor cabinet!\"\n\n\"Don't you want me to get out the ice cubes, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I'll do it. You can go now.\"\n\n\"But are you sure you won't want me later in the evening, Doctor? Who's\nto serve the supper? Who's going to clear up afterward?\"\n\n\"We'll manage. Don't worry about us.\"\n\nJames shuffled out of the room.\n\n\"I suppose that means _I'll_ manage,\" said Leah, with a self-pitying\nsigh. \"I've noticed that whenever people decide to rough it and do\nwithout a Menial, they take it for granted the women will do the work,\nnever the men--unless the women are still young and pretty. Well, at any\nrate, I'll have Tanya to help me. I still don't see why you wouldn't let\nme go to the Port to meet her, Dr. Wong.\"\n\n\"I just thought it would be more of a celebration if we had a surprise\nparty all waiting for her to walk into. Dr. Haslam will bring her here\ndirectly from the Port, and here we all are, her old friends from the\nInstitute, waiting to welcome her home.\"\n\n\"I'd hardly say all,\" said Leah. \"I'm the only person from Office that's\nhere. And why have a party in your Library, Dr. Wong? Nothing here but\nbooks, books, books.\"\n\n\"Because I keep my liquor here, in the only room I have a right to lock\nup. My Menial is a good man, but he can't resist an opened bottle.\"\n\n\"Well, it's still a gloomy party.\"\n\nDavid turned appealingly to his other guests, Hudson and Faur\u00e9, but they\nonly looked uncomfortable.\n\n\"Perhaps we need a drink.\" David unlocked the cupboard and picked up a\nbottle which he set down hastily when he heard voices in the hall. He\nhurried to the outer door and opened it a few inches to reveal the\nsturdy shoulders of the watchguard of the floor and, beyond him, Karl\nHaslam.\n\n\"Everything in order, Officer?\" asked Karl.\n\n\"Your permit is in order, Dr. Haslam. A private party. Let me just\ncheck--yes, three guests have arrived, and you two make five. That all?\nYou have until midnight. But it beats me why you people in Research\nprefer a party without a watchguard, or why Leader Marley ever gives\npermission. Why, in all my years in Military, I've never been to an\nunwatched party, and I must say it never held us down any.\"\n\nKarl laughed a little too forcedly. \"I'll bet it didn't! But all\nResearch people are a little peculiar. You must have noticed that\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"And you know how generous Leader Marley is, and how kind he is to loyal\ncitizens. He wants us to be happy, so he pampers us now and then.\"\n\n\"I guess he knows what he's doing, all right. Well, I'll check you out\nat twelve, then.\"\n\n\"Go on in, Tanya,\" said Karl.\n\nThey stepped into the apartment and David quietly closed the door.\n\n\"Hi, Sis,\" drawled Leah. \"You made us wait long enough!\" She walked\ntoward the girl, hand outstretched, then stopped with a gasp of\ndisbelief.\n\nTanya's red hair was still brilliant and gleaming, her creamy skin\nunlined, and her full red lips curved up into a friendly smile as she\nleaned forward for a sisterly kiss. But Leah jerked away and glared with\nanger.\n\nA puzzled frown creased Tanya's lovely white forehead.\n\n\"What's the matter, Leah? Aren't you glad to see me? You look so\nstrange, as though you'd been terribly ill!\"\n\nLeah shook her head, tears of rage gathering in her pale eyes. \"I'm\nokay,\" she whispered. \"It's you. You haven't changed. I have. You're\nstill young, you're pretty, _you're just the way I used to be_!\" She\nwhirled to face David, her voice choking.\n\n\"What have you done to her, Dr. Wong?\"\n\nThe four men in the room were all staring at the sisters, scarcely\nbelieving what they saw, although they had all been prepared for the\ncontrast. The twin sisters were no longer twins. One had retained her\nyouth; the other was faded, aging.\n\n\"This is awful,\" Haslam muttered. \"Absolutely ghastly.\" He put a\ncomforting hand on Leah's shoulder, and with a deep sob she hid her face\nagainst him and cried.\n\nHudson and Faur\u00e9 could not take their eyes from Tanya, and David leaned\nagainst the wall to stop his trembling.\n\n\"Sit down, all of you,\" he said. \"First we'll have a drink. I'm sure we\nall need it. Then we'll face--what has to be faced.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later, they had achieved a calmness, of sorts. They had given up\nsome of their normal sobriety to achieve the calm, but they were\ngrateful to the drug for cushioning the shock.\n\nDavid paced the floor, glass in hand, talking rapidly as he finished his\nlong explanation.\n\n\"So you see what happened,\" he said. \"When I began the experiment, I had\nno idea how staggering the results might be. That is, I knew in my mind,\nbut I never imagined the _realness_ of what would happen. I thought of\nit as just an experiment.\"\n\nLeah sniffed, her resentment somewhat dulled by drink. \"So I was just an\nexperiment! Don't you ever think about people's feelings? I know I'm not\nas good as you are; I'm only Office, but I'm human.\"\n\nKarl patted her hand. \"Of course you are, Leah. But that is one of the\ndefects of people in Research--they forget about human emotions.\" He\nlooked up sternly at David. \"They go ahead with their experiments, and\nhang the consequences. If Dr. Wong had had any sense, he would never\nhave kept this a secret for ten years, and we might have had ten years\nto prepare ourselves for such a responsibility. Instead, we have only a\nfew days or, at most, weeks. Hudson! Faur\u00e9! How do you feel about this\nthing now? Are you still game?\"\n\nBoth men seemed a little dazed, but Faur\u00e9 pulled himself together,\nspeaking slowly, like a man in a dream.\n\n\"We're with you. It's still hard to believe: we've got immortality!\"\n\n\"I'd hardly call it immortality,\" said Hudson drily, \"since, as I\nunderstand it, SDE does not kill disease entities, nor ward off bullets\nor the disintegrating nuclear shaft of the needler--as we will very\nlikely find out before very long. But what do we do now? When people see\nthese two girls together, it won't be an hour before Marley hears about\nit.\"\n\nDavid spoke up with a new authority. \"He must not hear about it. I know\nhow poorly equipped I am to handle this situation, but since I created\nit, I must assume responsibility, and I have made my plans.\n\n\"First, you, Tanya. Try to realize that if the Leader finds out that I\nhave this secret of keeping youth, he will want it for himself. Nobody\nin Menial, nobody in Office, nobody in Research--almost nobody at\nall--will be allowed to benefit from it. Marley will use it as a special\nreward for certain Rulers, and he will try to keep its very existence a\nsecret so that people in general will not be envious or rebellious. That\nmeans that he will have to get rid of you.\"\n\n\"Get rid of me? But I haven't done any harm!\"\n\n\"Just by existing and letting people look at your unchanging youth, you\nwill be a threat to him, for you will give away his secret. How he'll\ndeal with you, I don't know. Concentration camp, exile, or more\nprobably, simple execution on grounds of treason, such as unauthorized\nchoices of activity or study. It doesn't matter, he'll find a way. The\nonly safety for you is in keeping hidden. You must stay quietly in\nLeah's apartment until we can find a refuge for you. Do you see that?\"\n\nShe looked around in bewilderment. \"Is that right, Dr. Haslam? And what\nwill they think at the Institute? I'm supposed to go back to my job in\nIntercom.\"\n\n\"Dr. Wong is right,\" he said kindly. \"Please believe us. It's hard for\nyou to understand that we are asking you to do something secret, but\njust try to remember that you are, after all, an Office Category and are\nnot equipped by training or constitution to think out problems like\nthis. We'll tell you what is the right thing to do. You just do as we\ntell you, and you'll be perfectly safe.\"\n\nLeah snickered. \"Oh, _she'll_ be safe enough, being as pretty as she is!\nWhat are you going to do about me? Don't I count?\"\n\n\"We'll come to that in a few minutes. Right now, we need food. Leah, you\nand Tanya be good girls and go out to the kitchen and heat up some\nsupper for us. After we've eaten, we'll talk about you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as the girls were out of the room, the four men drew together at\nthe table.\n\n\"No use burdening them with too much knowledge,\" Karl remarked. \"Even as\nit is, they are a great danger to us, and the less they know the better.\nDavid, will you proceed?\"\n\n\"I have little to add to the plans we made last night at the lab. The\nthing we need most is time; and next to that, a hiding place. We may\nvery soon be classed as traitors, with every watchguard on the continent\nhunting for us. We will take care that they don't find us. Now, you said\nlast night that each one of you has accumulated a Free Choice during the\npast year, which hasn't yet been used.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Faur\u00e9. \"I intended to use mine next winter to live\namong the Australian aborigines for a week. I've been wanting that for\nyears, but the planners always refused me; it was a project without\npractical purpose.\"\n\n\"And I intended to use mine to attempt a water-color painting,\" added\nHudson. \"In my boyhood I hoped to be put in Arts Category, but the\nPlanners laughed at me. I suppose it's wrong, yet I still have the yen.\"\n\n\"You have my sympathy,\" said Karl. \"I was going to take an Aimless\nTramp. Just shed my identity and wander on foot through the great north\narea of woods and lakes.\"\n\nDavid sighed. \"Well, if we are successful in hiding and in changing the\nworld as we'd like, you can all three be free to do as you like without\nasking permission. But at present that's only the wildest of dreams.\nAnd, first, we must find our refuge. Today is Saturday. Tomorrow\nmorning, each of you will go to BureauMed and claim your Free Choice.\nAnd each of you will choose an Aimless Tramp.\"\n\n\"But I don't like hiking,\" objected Hudson.\n\n\"You won't be hiking. You'll take off in your roboplanes and then\ndisappear. You will be without supervision. You will then proceed,\ndisguised as you think suitable, to find a place for our new\ncolony--somewhere in South America?--and make preliminary arrangements\nto receive us. You must be back by Tuesday afternoon at the latest. On\nTuesday, as soon as you have reported back to BureauMed, get to the\nInstitute as fast as you can.\"\n\n\"Why the deadline?\"\n\n\"Because by Tuesday afternoon, sometime before evening, probably, I\nexpect all three of you to be suffering from an attack of Blue Martian\nFever, and I want you to get expert hospital care. You will be the\nnucleus of the new regime.\"\n\nKarl laughed. \"I wish you could have picked a base for your SDE that was\nless unpleasant than Blue Martian.\"\n\n\"Who's got Blue Martian?\" asked Tanya, as the girls came in from the\nkitchen with their trays of food. \"I'll never forget how sick it made\nme.\"\n\n\"You should worry,\" said Leah. \"It kept you young and beautiful, didn't\nit?\"\n\n\"You won't have to envy her, Leah,\" said David going to the liquor\ncabinet. \"I'm going to give you and the others a shot of the SDE-Martian\nBlue. Sometime Tuesday afternoon you should feel the first symptoms. But\nafter forty-eight hours in the hospital, you'll be good as new. And you\nwill all stop growing older.\"\n\nThey watched, fascinated, as he opened the cooling compartment of the\nliquor cupboard.\n\n\"I always like plenty of ice in my drinks,\" he remarked, drawing out a\ntray of cubes and opening a small door behind the tray. He removed\nseveral small bottles filled with a milky liquid, and a copper box of\nsterile needles and syringes.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Who'll be first?\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and David stopped.\n\n\"What is it?\" he called.\n\n\"Me,\" came the watchguard's voice. \"Just thought I'd do you a favor and\ntell you it's only ten minutes till checkout time. Time to get\nyourselves decent!\"\n\nThey could hear the rumble of his laugh as he moved on down the hall.\nTrembling, David picked up a bottle, poured alcohol onto the rubber cap,\nand deftly filled the sterile syringe. He reached for a piece of cotton,\ndipped it in iodine, and looked up, waiting. Karl Haslam had already\nbared his left arm. David swabbed the spot on the upper deltoid.\n\nKarl laughed. \"Here I come, Methuselah!\"\n\n\"All set?\" asked David.\n\nHe plunged the needle home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid ran up the steps of the Institute, two at a time, and hurried\ntoward his office through the echoing corridors, where the usual\nwatchguard sauntered on patrol.\n\n\"Morning, Jones.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Doctor. Pretty early, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Wednesday's my busy day.\" He settled at his desk, miserably conscious\nof the open door and curious eyes behind him, opened his briefcase, then\nglanced at his wristwatch. More than an hour before his interview with\nLeader Marley.\n\nSpreading some data sheets before him, he looked at them blankly as he\ntried to order his thoughts. His eyes were ringed with dark depressions,\nfor he had had no sleep. There had been so many things to plan for, so\nmany arrangements to make.\n\nIt was possible, of course, that this morning's talk would turn out to\nbe mere routine. There might remain several weeks of freedom--but there\nmight be only a few hours. He shrank from the complexity of the problem\nbefore him; he was a Research man, devoted to his test tubes and his\nculture growths, and would have been happy never to face any problem\nbeyond them.\n\nHe had a moment's revulsion at the unfairness of the fact that a simple\nexperiment in the lab, an addition to man's knowledge of the Universe,\nshould have plunged him against his will into a situation far beyond his\nability to handle. There had been, as Karl pointed out, the alternative\nof turning the SDE over to the Leader. That would have absolved him of\nall responsibility. But that was the trouble, he thought. Responsibility\ncould not be confined to squiggles in his notebook, when those squiggles\nmight affect the whole of society.\n\n\"Dr. Wong!\"\n\nHe jumped and turned around hastily.\n\n\"Leah! What in the world?\"\n\nShe stood in the doorway, glaring at him, breathing heavily as though\nshe were trying to hold back sobs. Slowly she tottered to the desk and\nsank down into her chair by the stenograph.\n\n\"You doublecrosser!\" she whispered.\n\nHe looked quickly at the doorway, but the guard had not come back.\nLeaning forward, he questioned her fiercely.\n\n\"What are you doing here? They told me yesterday that several people had\ncome down with attacks of Blue Martian. Why aren't you in the hospital\nwith the others?\"\n\n\"Because I wasn't sick!\"\n\n\"But I gave you--\"\n\n\"Imagine how I felt,\" she raced on, \"watching Dr. Haslam start having a\nchill, hearing Dr. Faur\u00e9 complain about his awful headache, and\nlistening to Dr. Hudson dial Intercom and call for a doctor. And all\nthat time I was waiting, waiting for something to happen to me. And\nnothing did! What have you got against me, Dr. Wong, that you infect all\nthe others and only pretend to do it to me? I don't want to grow old any\nmore than they do!\"\n\n\"But I wasn't pretending. Quiet, now, and let me think.\"\n\nHe waited until the watchguard had passed by the door, then raised his\nhead.\n\n\"Look here, Leah. Evidently the infection didn't take. This is what must\nhave happened. That treatment I gave you ten years ago must have made\nyou permanently immune to Blue Martian, and the antibodies it formed in\nyour cells simply protected you against this new invasion of the virus.\nIt never occurred to me that the immunity would last so long. But don't\nworry, I'll find a way.\"\n\nShe looked suspicious. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that there's no reason why Blue Martian should be the only\nvehicle for giving you the SDE. There must be other viruses that will\nwork equally well. It's only a question of finding one.\"\n\n\"And how long will that take you?\"\n\n\"How long does anything take in Research? Maybe a week, maybe a year.\"\n\n\"And maybe ten! I can't wait, Dr. Wong. I'm thirty-five now; I'm growing\nolder. What good will a long life do me, if it only preserves me as the\nmiddle-aged woman I'll be by then? And all those years that I'll be\ngetting older and older, there'll be Tanya, lively and pretty, to remind\nme that I was once like that, too. I can't face it!\"\n\n\"The watchguard will hear you!\" Haggard-faced, he watched her shaking\nshoulders, hearing her muffled sobs.\n\n\"You're a criminal, Dr. Wong! It was a crime, what you did to Tanya and\nme.\"\n\n\"I didn't realize in the beginning or I'd never have touched the thing.\nI know it now, even better than you do, but what can I do?\"\n\nShe looked up and wiped her eyes, her mouth set hard. \"I know what I can\ndo. I can report you to the Leader.\"\n\n\"What good will that do? You know how terrible you feel now about being\nleft out--though I swear I never meant it to be like this. But just try\nto imagine. If you report me so that Leader Marley gets the secret of\nSDE, then thousands of people will be put in just the same situation you\nare in. You're only one person suffering. But then there'd be hundreds\nof thousands, millions! Surely you wouldn't want to have that on your\nconscience?\"\n\n\"Do you think I'd care?\"\n\n\"You would when you felt calmer. You're wrought up, ill. Let me send you\nhome. Promise me you'll go home quietly, talk it over with Tanya, and\nnot say anything to anyone else. I'll think of a way out for you. Just\nbe patient.\"\n\n\"Patient!\"\n\nHe thought of calling Karl Haslam. Karl would know best how to deal with\nher, how to bring her back to reason. He reached toward the intercom,\nthen dropped his hand in despair. Karl was in the hospital, with Faur\u00e9\nand Hudson, shivering with the cold of Blue Martian fever. But he had to\nget her away.\n\nHe pressed the intercom dial. \"Dr. Wong speaking. Miss Hachovnik is ill\nand is being sent home. Please send an aircab for her at once.\"\n\nHe helped Leah to her feet, and spoke pleadingly.\n\n\"Promise you'll be good, Leah?\"\n\nThe fury in her eyes nearly knocked him down. Without a word, without a\ngesture, she walked out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid felt as though he'd been put through a wringer as he followed\nOfficer Magnun into the Leader's suite at State House. Several nights of\nsleeplessness, the worries of planning for a refuge, and the scene with\nLeah had left him limp and spiritless. The girl was a danger, he knew,\nbut she was only one of many.\n\nHe nodded at Dr. Lanza, who was busy reading reports from BureauMed, and\nsaluted Leader Marley, who was talking with a watchguard.\n\nMarley looked up briefly. \"Sit down, Wong.\"\n\nDavid folded himself into a chair, grateful for a few moments in which\nto collect himself, while Marley gave the last of his orders.\n\n\"Put them in the Vermont granite quarries, and keep them at work for the\nnext year.\"\n\n\"As you say, Leader. With the usual secrecy, of course?\"\n\n\"No, you blockhead! These are a bunch of nobodies. Use all the publicity\nyou can get. Keep a punishment a secret and how can it have any effect\non other people? No, I want full radio and news coverage and telecast\nshowings as they swing the first pick at the first rocks. People have\ngot to realize that the Leader knows best, that treason doesn't pay. No\nmatter how clever they think they are, they'll always get caught.\nUnderstand?\"\n\n\"As you say, Leader.\"\n\n\"Then get going.\" As the guard left the room, Leader Marley turned to\nDavid. \"What fools people are!\"\n\nHe ran his beefy hands through a shock of black hair, blinked his eyes,\nand wrinkled the heavy black brows that met over his nose. Wonderingly,\nhe shook his massive head as he drew his gleaming needler from his\nbreast pocket and played with it, tossing it from hand to hand while he\ntalked.\n\n\"I'm probably the most generous Leader the State has had since the\nAtomic Wars, Wong, and I never withhold a privilege from someone who has\ndeserved it. But people mistake me when they think that I am weak and\nwill overlook treason.\"\n\n\"Your generosity is a byword, Leader Marley,\" said Wong. \"But some\npeople are incapable of acting for their best interests even when you\nhave defined it for them. Who are these latest traitors?\"\n\n\"Oh, nobody really important, of course, except as they waste time which\nthey owe to the State. Just attempts at illegal study. An Office\nCategory who had found a basement room in a deserted building and was\nspending all his evening hours there practicing the violin. A Theater\nman who was illegally trying to learn carpentry. And a teacher of\nmathematics who had forged a key to the Linguistics library, and had\nbeen getting in every night to study a dead language--Cuneiform, Latin,\nsomething like that, utterly without practical value. This last one is\nan old man, too, and ought to have known better. People must be made to\nrealize that if they want the privilege of useless study, they will have\nto earn it. And I am very broadminded in such cases.\"\n\n\"Nobody has better reason to know that than I, Leader Marley, and I am\nalways grateful to you.\"\n\nMarley coughed and straightened the jacket over his bearlike chest as he\nput back his needler.\n\n\"Now to business. Where's that memorandum, Lanza?\"\n\nDr. Lanza handed him the paper, then sat down beside the Leader.\n\n\"First. When Dr. Lanza called on you last week, he found the door to\nyour office locked. What explanation do you have?\"\n\nDavid smiled and spread his hands. \"My explanation is the generosity of\nLeader Marley. You have so many affairs to occupy your attention that it\nis not surprising that you do not remember rewarding me with a Free\nChoice some years ago, for my work on Martian Blue. I chose, as I am\nsure you remember now, an occasional hour of Privacy.\"\n\nThe Leader blinked. \"That's right. I had forgotten. Well, the Leader\nnever goes back on his word. Though why in the name of Marley you\nfellows want a crazy thing like that is beyond me. What do you _do_,\nbehind a locked door, that you don't want anyone to see?\"\n\n\"Do you doubt my loyalty, Leader Marley?\"\n\n\"I doubt everything. What do you _want_ with Privacy?\"\n\nLanza broke in amiably. \"I'm afraid we just have to accept such wishes\nas one of the harmless abnormalities of the Research mind, Leader. Since\nI grew up in that Category, I understand it to some extent.\"\n\n\"You're right in calling it abnormal. I think perhaps I'd better remove\nthat from the possible Choices in the future. It could easily be\nmisused, and it never did make any sense to me.\n\n\"Well, second. It's been more than three years since you reported any\nprogress with the problem of White Martian Fever, Wong. What is your\nexplanation?\"\n\n\"Research is not always swift, Leader.\"\n\n\"But I distinctly ordered you to find an immunizing agent within three\nyears. Our colonies on Mars cannot wait forever. I've been patient with\nyou, but you've had more than enough time.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, Leader Marley. I have done my best and so have my\ncolleagues. But the problem is complex. If I may explain, we had to find\na suitable culture medium for growing the virus, and then we had to work\nat the problem of coupling it with suitable haptens--\"\n\nImpatiently, Marley waved his hand. \"You know I don't understand your\njargon. That's not my business, what troubles you've had. I want\nresults. You got results on Blue Martian quickly enough.\"\n\n\"We were fortunate. But when we storm the citadel of knowledge, Leader\nMarley, no one can predict how long it will take for the citadel to\nfall.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! I'm warning you, Wong, you're failing in your duty to the\nState, and you can't escape the consequences with poetic doubletalk. I\nallow special privileges to you people in Research and I expect a proper\nappreciation in return. When I order you to produce a protection for\nWhite Martian, I want results!\"\n\n\"But you can't get a thing like that just by asking for it. Such things\nare simply not under your control.\"\n\n\"Watch yourself, Wong! Your remarks are dangerously close to treason!\"\n\n\"Is it treason to tell you a plain fact?\"\n\nStony-faced, David stared defiantly at Marley, trying to control the\ntrembling of his body. If he had had a needler at that instant, he\nrealized incredulously, he would have shot the Leader and thought his\nown life a small price to pay for such a pleasure.\n\nLanza coughed. \"I'm afraid Dr. Wong is not well, Leader. Worrying over\nthe slowness of his work has distorted his reactions. But I am sure that\nyou will understand, as you always do, and be indulgent.\"\n\n\"I'll overlook your remarks, Wong,\" said Marley, relaxing. \"But you'd\nbetter change your attitude. You Research people cause me more trouble\nthan any other three Categories put together. Sometimes I wonder if a\nspell in the granite quarries mightn't--\"\n\nA light flashed on his desk. He watched the blinking code for a second,\nthen rose abruptly and left the room.\n\nThe two men sat in silence. David glanced at Lanza, and Lanza shifted in\nhis chair.\n\n\"Thanks for the good word,\" said David wearily. \"How do you like being a\nRuler, by the way? When we were at Medschool together, I thought you\nwere a man with ideas.\"\n\n\"When I was at Medschool I didn't know what was good for me,\" Lanza\nreplied stiffly.\n\n\"And you think you do now?\"\n\nA slow flush crept over Lanza's face. \"Look here, Wong! Each man has to\nmake his own terms with himself. Don't act so smug! You shut yourself\naway inside the nice white walls of your laboratory and ignore all the\nconflicts of life. You shut your ears and your eyes, live in perfect\nharmony with your test tubes, and let the world go hang. Well, that\nisn't my way.\"\n\n\"Your way, apparently, is to worm yourself into the confidence of that\nsteel-hearted imbecile who rules our lives and our thoughts, and spend\ntwenty-four hours a day saying, 'Yes, Yes,' and waiting for him to die\nso you can step into his shoes!\"\n\n\"We're alone,\" said Lanza. \"I won't report you. But I have no intention\nof justifying myself. Have you any idea why you've been let alone for so\nlong? You haven't produced anything tangible in several years. Haven't\nyou ever wondered why no one put on the pressure? Haven't--\"\n\nHe broke off as Marley lumbered back into the room and fell into a\nchair. The Leader's manner had altered. He stared at David with grim\ninquiry, the beady eyes traveling slowly over him, taking in his rumpled\nhair, his strained face, the rigid set of his shoulders.\n\nAt last Marley spoke, his voice soft with menace.\n\n\"You're looking well, Dr. Wong. Remarkably well. In fact, it occurs to\nme that you don't seem to have aged a bit since my last visit to your\nlaboratory. Tell me, how do you keep your youth?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid could feel the rush of blood through his body, feel the thud of\nhis racing heart. He kept his voice low so that it would not tremble.\n\n\"Thank you, Leader Marley, for your kindness in noticing my appearance.\nI suppose I chose my parents well. They both lived to be over ninety,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"This is no joking matter. I've just had a report. An epidemic of Blue\nMartian fever has broken out among the people of your Institute. Why\nhave you not mentioned it?\"\n\n\"If you will forgive me, Leader Marley, I've had no chance. I reported\nit in the usual manner to the health authorities, and have here in my\nbriefcase a memorandum which I hoped to bring to your attention, among\nseveral other matters, when you had finished giving your instructions to\nme.\"\n\nMarley continued implacably, \"And how did this epidemic begin? It was my\nunderstanding that no insect existed here on Earth that could transmit\nthe virus. Yet several people from your lab came down with the disease\non the same day. What is your explanation?\"\n\n\"It's very simple. To prepare the vaccine, as I am sure you will\nremember from your last visit to us, we have to keep in the lab a\nlimited number of the _Fafli_, the Martian insects which act as hosts at\none stage of the virus's life. Last week a Menial carelessly knocked\nover one of the cages and several _Fafli_ escaped. The Menial was\ndischarged, of course, and put in Punishment, but the damage had already\nbeen done.\"\n\n\"You have a very ready explanation.\"\n\n\"Would you rather I had none at all, Leader Marley?\"\n\n\"Well, let that go.\" Marley drummed his plump fingers on the desk as he\ncontinued. \"There was another report for me just now. A report so wild,\nso incredible, so staggering that I can scarcely bring myself to take it\nseriously. From an Office Category at the Institute.\"\n\nDavid's heart beat wildly, but he forced a smile to his lips. \"Oh, yes.\nYou must mean Miss Hachovnik. I've been worried about that poor girl for\nsome time.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'poor girl'?\"\n\n\"It's very distressing to me, because she has been a good and loyal\nworker for many years. But she is becoming unstable. She has a tendency\nto burst into tears over nothing, is sometimes hysterical, seems to have\nsecret grievances, and is extremely jealous of all women whom she\nconsiders more attractive. She was never too bright, to be sure, but\nuntil recently she has done her work well, so I've hated to take any\naction. Just this morning I had to send her home because she was ill.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" asked Marley, \"that none of her story is true?\"\n\n\"I don't know. What is her story?\"\n\n\"She reports that you have been working on a private project of your\nown, instead of on White Martian. That you have discovered a way to make\npeople immortal, by infecting them with Blue Martian. What is your\nexplanation?\"\n\nDavid only stared, his mind so blurred with panic that he could not\nspeak. His stunned silence was broken by a laugh. It was Dr. Lanza,\nleaning backward in his chair, holding himself over the stomach as he\nshook his head.\n\n\"These hysterical women!\" His laughter trailed off to a commiserating\nchuckle. \"You're too forbearing, Wong. You shouldn't keep a worker who's\nso far gone. Take a leaf from Leader Marley's book and remember:\nKindness is often weakness; when it is necessary for the good of the\nState, be harsh!\"\n\n\"I hardly know what to say,\" said David. \"I had no idea she'd gone so\nfar.\"\n\n\"Then there's no truth in it?\" Marley persisted. \"What she says is\nimpossible?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said David judiciously, \"we people in Research have learned not\nto call anything _impossible_, but this dream of immortality is as old\nas the human race. We have a thousand legends about it, including the\nstory of the Phoenix, that fabulous bird which, when consumed by fire,\nrose triumphant from its own ashes to begin life anew. A pretty story,\nof course. But I need only put it to a mind as logical as yours, Leader\nMarley. Throughout all the millenia of man's existence, the Sun has\nalways risen each morning in the east, and thus we know that it always\nwill. That is the order of nature. Likewise, from the earliest\ngenerations of man, no individual has ever lived longer than a hundred\nand some years, and thus we know that he never will. That is the order\nof Nature and we can't alter it to the best of my knowledge.\"\n\nLeader Marley was thoughtful. He touched the intercom.\n\n\"Send in Officer Magnun.\"\n\nDavid held his breath.\n\n\"Magnun, Office Category Hachovnik is to be taken from her home at once\nand put in indefinite Psycho-detention.\"\n\nMarley stood up. \"Very well, Dr. Wong. You may go. But I shall suspend\nyour privilege of Privacy, at least until after you have devised a\nprotection against White Martian. It is not wise to disregard the wishes\nof the Leader. Lanza, show him out.\"\n\nAt the street door, they paused. Lanza looked at David speculatively.\n\n\"You _do_ keep your youth well, David.\"\n\n\"Some people do.\"\n\n\"I remember that legend of the Phoenix. What do you suppose the Phoenix\ndid with his new life, once he'd risen from the ashes of his old self?\"\n\n\"I'm no philosopher.\"\n\n\"Neither am I. But you and I both know that the principle of induction\nwas exploded centuries ago. It's true that the Sun _has_ always risen in\nthe east. But is there anything to keep it, someday, from rising in the\nwest?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night David sat late at his desk. Through the open door behind him,\nhe could hear the watchguard slowly pacing the dimly lit corridor. He\ncould feel time pressing at his back. He was reprieved, he knew, but for\nhow long?\n\nHe got up, at one point, when the corridor behind him was quiet, and\nwent to the bookcase. He pressed the brass handle, saw the shelves\nsilently swing away from the wall, then set it back again. The\nmechanism, installed a century ago by a cautious politician, was still\nin good order.\n\nBack at his desk, he thought of Leah and her lost youth, lost because of\nhis own impersonal attitude. He felt sorry for her, but there was\nnothing he could do for her now. It was a relief to know that Tanya, at\nleast, remained hidden and secure in her sister's apartment.\n\nIt was after midnight before he closed his notebook and locked it away\nin the top drawer. His plans were completed. There would not be time\ngiven him, he knew, to finish his work on White Martian. That would have\nto be dropped, and resumed at some more favorable time in the future--if\nthere was a future for him. But he would begin at once to produce in\nquantity a supply of the SDE-Blue Martian, for he was sure that the\nuntrained guards who watched his movements would never realize that he\nhad shifted to another project.\n\nWith a brief good night to the guard, he left the building to walk home.\nHis shoulders were straight, his stride confident, and he disdained\nlooking behind him to see if anyone was following. He had made his terms\nwith himself, and only death, which he would certainly try to prevent,\ncould alter his plans.\n\nGoing into his apartment he wearily turned on the light. Then he froze,\nfeeling as though he had been clubbed. Leah Hachovnik was huddled at one\nend of the sofa, her face dripping tears.\n\n\"I thought you'd never come,\" she whispered.\n\nHe slumped down beside her. \"How did you get here, Leah? I thought you\nwere--\"\n\n\"I hid in your hallway until the watchguard was at the other end. When\nhis back was turned, I just took off my shoes and slipped in. I've been\nwaiting for hours.\" Her voice was almost inaudible, spent beyond\nemotion.\n\n\"They got Tanya,\" she said dully. \"They took her away.\"\n\n\"What happened? Quick!\"\n\n\"After I reported to BureauMed--I'm sorry I did that, Dr. Wong, but I\njust couldn't help myself. I didn't tell them about Tanya and the\nothers, just about you. Then I walked around for hours, hating you,\nhating Tanya, hating everybody. Finally I got so tired that I went home.\nJust as I got into the hall, I heard a loud knock and I saw Officer\nMagnun at my door. When Tanya opened it, he simply said, 'Office\nCategory Hachovnik?' When she nodded her head, he said, 'You're under\ndetention.' She screamed and she fought, but he took her away. Since\nthen, I've been hiding. I'm afraid.\"\n\nDavid tried to think. He remembered that he had said only \"Miss\nHachovnik\" in his talk with the Leader. Had Marley never known that\nthere was more than one? But Lanza surely knew. Or had he merely assumed\nthat Magnun would ask for Leah? Would they realize, at Psycho-detention,\nthat they had the wrong woman? Probably not, for she would be hysterical\nwith terror, and her very youth and beauty taken in connection with the\n\"jealousy and envy of younger women\" which was noted in her commitment\norder, would seem to confirm her madness. He was still safe, for a\nwhile--if he could keep Leah away from the Institute.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" she whimpered. \"Don't let them put me away.\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to do exactly as I tell you. Can you follow orders\nexactly?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"I'll have to hide you here. We can fix up my library as a room for you.\nIt's the only room I can keep locked, and which my Menial never enters\nin my absence. Whatever happens, Leah--no matter what happens--keep\nyourself hidden. More than your life depends on that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the three convalescents returned from the hospital, pale and shaky,\nDavid summoned them to his office. At the door, Watchguard Jones looked\nthem over.\n\n\"Say, that Blue Martian fever sure does take it out of you. You fellows\nlook like you've been plenty sick!\"\n\n\"They have been,\" said David. \"Let them by so they can sit down and\nrest.\"\n\nJones moved aside, but he lounged in the doorway, listening.\n\nDavid ignored him. \"Glad to see you back, gentlemen. I'll make this\nbrief. You have been the victims of a laboratory accident just as much\nas if you'd been contaminated with radiation. Our Leader Marley, who\nunderstands the problems of all Categories, has very generously\nconsented to grant you a two weeks' convalescence, in addition to a Free\nChoice. Take a few minutes to think over your decision.\"\n\nHe strolled over to the window and looked out at the green of the trees\njust bursting into leaf. Then, as if on impulse, he turned back.\n\n\"While you're thinking it over, will you look at these protocols? We\ndiscussed them before you got sick, you remember--a plan to prevent an\nepidemic of Blue Martian. Do you approve of the final form? I'd like to\ncarry on, and after all,\" he added with an ironic smile, \"it's getting\nlater than we might think.\"\n\nHe handed each man a sheet of paper whose contents were identical. They\nstudied them. Karl Haslam was the first to speak.\n\n\"You think, then, that other cases of Blue Martian may develop?\"\n\n\"It is certainly probable. Those _Fafli_ insects were never caught.\"\n\nKarl looked back at his paper. It contained a list of names, some of\nwhich were well known to all the country, some of them obscure.\nThoughtfully, he nodded as he ran down the list.\n\nHudson glanced up, frowning, his finger pointed at one name.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said slowly, \"that this particular experiment would\nprove useful. Surely the Lanza method has not proved to be as effective\nas we once hoped.\"\n\n\"You may be right. But there's the bare possibility that the _modified_\nLanza method might be of enormous benefit to us.\"\n\n\"It is uncertain. Too much of a risk. That's my opinion.\"\n\n\"Then I'll reconsider. The rest has your approval? Very well. And now\nwhat choice have you made for your holiday?\"\n\n\"I think we are all agreed,\" said Karl soberly. \"We'll have an Aimless\nTramp.\"\n\n\"An excellent idea,\" approved David. \"Oh, Jones, will you get an aircab\nto take the doctors to BureauMed, and then arrange for their Roboplanes\nto be serviced and ready in an hour?\"\n\n\"I don't know as I ought to leave my post,\" said Jones.\n\n\"You'd rather stay with us and perhaps be exposed to the Fever?\"\n\n\"Okay, okay!\"\n\nWhen his footsteps had died away, David leaned forward.\n\n\"We've done our best. Another month or so and we should be completely\nready for our retirement act.\"\n\n\"If we have a month,\" said Faur\u00e9.\n\nDavid grinned. \"Well, if our time runs out, at least we'll go down\nfighting. You know all your lines, your props are ready, the plot is\nworked out, and we can slip into our makeup in an instant--provided the\naudience shows up.\"\n\n\"You're getting to be quite a joker, David,\" said Karl. \"What if the\naudience comes around to the stage door?\"\n\n\"Then we'll try to receive him properly. Our Leader is a man of iron,\nbut I doubt that he's immortal.\"\n\nThey heard the approaching guard.\n\n\"I'm sure you'll benefit from your holiday,\" David went on. \"That last\ncheckup showed an antibody titer entirely too high for safety.\"\n\n\"In other words, it's time for us to get going?\" asked Karl, smiling.\n\n\"That's right. Only the next time the antibody curve rises, it will be\nfor keeps.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour days later it was reported that Judge Brinton, the well-known\nchampion of Category rights, was ill with Blue Martian fever. Three\nlittle-known nuclear physicists living in the same apartment in Oak\nRidge developed symptoms on the same day. Sporadic cases of Blue Martian\nflared up all over the continent. Occasionally a whole family was\naffected--husband, wife, and all the children. There was a mild epidemic\nat MIT, a more serious one at the School of Social Structure, and at\nHarvard Medical School nearly a third of the senior class, and they the\nmost brilliant, were hospitalized at the same time.\n\nRumors blanketed the country like a fog, and people everywhere became\nuneasy. There were no deaths from the illness, but the very idea that an\ninfectious disease could flare up unpredictably all over the nation, out\nof control, was frightening. It was said that the disease had been\nbeamed to Earth by alien enemies from space; that all its victims became\nsterile; or that their minds were permanently damaged.\n\nIt was also said, though people laughed even as they repeated the rumor,\nthat if you once had Blue Martian Fever you'd become immortal. This\nparticular theory had been clearly traced to the ravings of a red-haired\nmadwoman who was confined to Psycho-detention, but still it was too\nridiculous not to repeat. For a week, comedians rang a hundred changes\non the basic joke:\n\nWife: Drop dead!\n\nHusband: I can't. I've had Blue Martian.\n\nThe unrest became so great that Leader Marley himself appeared on the\ntelecaster to reassure the nation.\n\nHe was an impressive figure on the lighted screen, resting solid and at\nease in a leather chair, raising his massive black head, lifting his big\nhand to gesture as his rich voice rolled out.\n\n\"You have nothing to fear,\" he said. \"Under your beneficent Leaders,\ninfectious disease has been wiped out many years ago. BureauMed informs\nme that these scattered cases of Blue Martian fever have been caused by\nthe escape of a few _Fafli_ insects, which have, since then, been\nisolated and destroyed. The illness has no serious after-effects. And as\nfor the rumors that it confers immortality--\"\n\nHe allowed his face to break into a pitying smile as he slowly shook his\nhead, looking regretful and yet somehow amused.\n\n\"Those who continue to spread gossip about the fever will only reveal\nthemselves as either psychotics or traitors. Whichever they are, they\nwill be isolated for the good of our society.\"\n\nThe effect of his words was somewhat diminished by the brief glimpse\npeople had of Dr. Lanza, who reached a hand to help the Leader rise. For\nDr. Lanza wore an anxious frown, and his face was thin with worry.\n\nIn spite of numerous arrests, the rumors continued. For two weeks\nsporadic outbreaks of the fever occurred, and then, abruptly, they\nceased.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was more than a week after the last case had been reported that David\nsat in his basement laboratory beside the opened mouse cage, watching\nwith wry affection as the furry creatures crawled over his hand. These\nwere historic mice, he reflected, whose reactions to SDE had opened up a\nnew world, a world which he must somehow help to make better than the\npresent one.\n\nHis three colleagues had returned a few days ago from their holiday.\nThey had calmly come back to work, and apparently nobody had thought to\nput two and two together, and thus connect the epidemic with the\nvacationers. It had been unfortunate that Tanya should have been put\nunder arrest; it was difficult trying to find amusement for Leah so that\nshe would keep out of sight, but still, on the whole, their luck had\nbeen good.\n\nBut it was time for David to go back to work in his office. Gently he\ndetached the mice from his hand, dropped them into their cage, and\nclosed the wire trap. He took his leather pencil case and the keys to\nhis desk from the pocket of his lab coat and laid them on the desk,\nbelow the nail on which his wristwatch hung. Carelessly he dropped his\nlab coat onto the desk and reached for his jacket, then paused,\nlistening.\n\nThe chatter in the technicians' room suddenly died. In the unnatural\nquiet sounded a steady march of feet.\n\nDavid turned to meet the probing black eyes of Leader Marley. Just\nbehind him were Dr. Lanza and Officer Magnun.\n\nThere was no time to conceal his mice, David realized. Shrugging into\nhis jacket, he strode forward without hesitation, a smile on his face,\nand stretched out his hand.\n\n\"Leader Marley! This is indeed an honor. If you had only notified us of\nyour visit, we should have been prepared.\"\n\n\"Young as ever, I see, Wong.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Leader.\" There was no banter in Marley's eyes, he noted, but\nhe continued amiably. \"It has been some years since you have honored us\nby a visit in person. I'm afraid a laboratory is not a very exciting\nplace, but I'd be honored to show you anything that may be of interest\nto you.\"\n\nA faint contempt curled Marley's mouth as he glanced around the room.\n\"Nothing to see that I haven't seen before, is there? A lot of test\ntubes, a bunch of flasks, a mess of apparatus you'd think had been\ndreamed up by an idiot, and a bad smell. You still keep animals, I\nnotice.\"\n\nHe sauntered over to the bench, picked up the cage and looked at the\nscurrying rodents.\n\nDavid scarcely breathed.\n\nMarley only nodded. \"Well, mice are mice.\" He put down the cage and\nturned away. \"These look just like the ones I saw when I was here eight\nor ten years ago. Same white patch on the forelimbs. I never knew mice\ncould live that long.\"\n\n\"But--\" began Lanza, bending over to study the mice.\n\n\"What an amazing memory you have, Leader,\" said David. \"Just as you\nguessed, these mice are the direct descendants of the ones you saw on\nyour former visit, a special mutant strain. The chief difference is that\nthese are marked with white patches on the _right_ forelimbs, while, as\nI am sure you recall, the original specimens were marked on the _left_\nforelimbs. Odd how these marks run in families, isn't it?\"\n\nLanza put down the cage and strolled toward the door as Marley took a\nlast bored look around.\n\n\"Nothing new here that I ought to see, Lanza?\"\n\n\"No. Nothing new.\"\n\n\"Well, I've no time to waste. I've come here for two reasons, Dr. Wong.\nWe both want a booster shot for Blue Martian. Ten years is a long time,\nand there's been this epidemic.\"\n\n\"Which is now under control.\"\n\n\"That may be, but I still want a booster. You Research people don't\nalways know as much as you think you do. When that's done, I want a\ndetailed report of your progress on White Martian.\"\n\n\"I shall be happy to give it,\" said David. \"If you will go directly to\nmy office, I'll pick up the vaccine and syringes, and be with you in a\nfew minutes.\"\n\nMarley and Officer Magnun marched to the door, and David followed,\nstanding aside to let Lanza precede him. Lanza hesitated there, staring\nat the floor. Then he smiled and looked directly at David.\n\n\"Beautiful spring weather we are having. I'm wondering about the\nmarvelous order of nature. Did you happen to notice, this morning,\nwhether the Sun did actually rise in the east?\"\n\nDavid stared at the retreating back. There was no longer any doubt in\nhis mind. Lanza knew. What was he going to do?\n\n\"Hurry up, Doctor,\" said Officer Magnun from the doorway.\n\n\"Right away.\" He opened the refrigerator and inspected the two groups of\nred-capped vials sitting on the shelf. He had no time to think, no time\nto weigh pros and cons; he could only act. Choosing two vials, he added\nthem to the sterile kit from the autoclave, and took a last look around.\n\nHe noticed his watch still hanging on the wall, and the lab coat which\ncovered his leather pencil case. He started to take them, then slowly\ndropped his hand and touched the intercom.\n\n\"Get me Dr. Karl Haslam.\"\n\n\"You're keeping the Leader waiting,\" said Magnun, but David paid no\nattention.\n\n\"Dr. Haslam? Dr. Wong speaking. I may be a little late getting up to see\nthose precipitates of yours. But you keep them simmering, just in case.\nIt's very probable that the antibody curve will rise.... Yes, I'll let\nyou know if I can.\"\n\nMagnun followed him to the office, then strolled away for a chat with\nWatchguard Jones.\n\nDavid put his things on his desk and made his preparations in\nbusinesslike fashion while Marley and Lanza glanced curiously around the\noffice. He watched apprehensively as Marley inspected the bookcase, then\nturned away.\n\n\"I never could understand why Research needs so many books,\" he\nremarked.\n\n\"Please roll up your sleeve, Leader Marley. I'm ready for you now.\"\n\nDeftly he assembled the syringe, filled it to the two centimeter mark,\nand scrubbed the arm presented to him.\n\n\"Ready?\" He inserted the needle and slowly expelled the fluid. Then,\ntaking a fresh syringe, he repeated the operation, filling from the\nsecond vial.\n\n\"Why do those bottles have different numbers?\" asked Marley. \"Aren't we\ngetting the same thing?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Just lab routine, so we can keep track of how many units\nhave been used from our stock. There, that does it, Lanza. Both of you\nwill be perfectly safe for a good many years to come.\"\n\nHe was washing his hands at the sink when he heard a struggle at the\ndoor. Turning, he saw Leah, thin, gaunt and terrified, held fast in the\ngrip of Officer Magnun, who forced her inside and slammed the door\nbehind them.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this intrusion?\" demanded Marley.\n\n\"There's some funny business going on, Leader,\" said Magnun. \"I caught\nthis woman trying to sneak in here. She says she's Miss Hachovnik and\nshe works here. Only she ain't. I arrested Miss Hachovnik myself, and I\nremember well enough what she looked like. She was a cute chick, not a\nbit like this dame.\"\n\nMarley was staring at the sobbing girl, eyes blinking as he thought,\nlooked back, remembered. Slowly his eyes shifted to David, and David\nfelt like a man impaled.\n\n\"You may leave, Magnun,\" said the Leader.\n\n\"You don't want me to arrest this woman?\"\n\n\"Let go of her! I said you may leave!\"\n\n\"As you say, Leader.\"\n\nWhen the door closed, the room throbbed to Leah's sobs.\n\n\"I couldn't help it, Dr. Wong,\" she cried. \"I got so bored, sitting and\nlooking at those books, day after day, with nothing to do! I thought I'd\njust slip down here for an hour and say hello to people, and--\"\n\n\"Quiet, Hachovnik!\" roared Marley. He quieted his voice. \"I understand\nnow, Wong. I remember. There were two girls. Twins. The one in\nPsycho-detention, according to Officer Magnun, is still beautiful and\nyoung. It's no use, Wong. You do know the secret of immortality. And you\ntold me the Phoenix was only a fairy tale!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid felt entirely calm. Whatever might happen now, at least the\nsuspense was over. He had done all he could, and it was a relief to have\nthings in the open. He thought fleetingly of his colleagues, alerted by\nhis message, frantically putting their plans into operation, but he\nleaned back against the sink with every appearance of ease.\n\n\"You're not quite right, Leader Marley. I cannot confer immortality. All\nI am able to do is stave off the aging process.\"\n\n\"That will do me nicely. And it's connected somehow with the Blue\nMartian virus?\"\n\n\"Yes. The disease serves as the vehicle.\"\n\nWith a brisk motion, Marley drew his needler from his breast pocket and\naimed it steadily at David. \"_Give it to me!_\"\n\n\"You're rather ambiguous,\" said David. How were his friends getting\nalong? Were they ready yet? Had Karl visited the basement lab? \"Do you\nmean you want me to give you the injection to prolong your life, or the\nsecret of how to do it, or what?\"\n\n\"Don't quibble! First you'll give me the injection to make me immortal.\nThen you'll turn over to me all your notes on procedure. Then my friend\nhere will needle you with a shaft of electrons and end your interest in\nthe problem.\"\n\n\"Surely you won't keep such a good thing all for yourself,\" said David.\n\"What about Dr. Lanza? He's your right-hand man. Don't you want him to\nlive forever, too? What about Officer Magnun? He's a faithful servant.\"\n\n\"You're stalling, Wong. Do you want me to kill you now?\"\n\n\"It won't be wise to needle me yet, Leader Marley. The secret would be\nlost forever.\"\n\n\"I'll have your notes!\"\n\n\"Yes? Try to read them. They're written in Coptic, a dead language that\nyou consider it a waste of time to learn, because such knowledge is\nimpractical. There aren't half a dozen men on Earth who could make head\nor tail of my notebook.\"\n\n\"Then I'll find that half-dozen! I want the injection.\" He gestured with\nthe gleaming weapon.\n\n\"This is once when I have no Free Choice,\" said David. \"Very well.\" He\nstarted toward the door, but halted at the roar of command.\n\n\"Stop! Do you think I'm fool enough to let you out of my sight?\"\n\n\"But I have to get the inoculant.\"\n\n\"Use the intercom. Send for it.\"\n\nDavid slumped into the chair and opened the intercom. He could almost\nfeel the electronic shaft of the needler ripping into his body. His\nheart beat wildly, and the tension of adrenalin ran through his body.\nHis lips felt cold, but he held them steady as he spoke into the dial.\n\n\"Get me Dr. Haslam.... Karl? David Wong speaking. Will you send someone\nup with a vial of phoenix special? The precipitates? I should say the\nantibody titer has reached the danger point. Don't delay treatment any\nlonger.\"\n\nSilently they waited. Marley's grim face did not relax; his eyes were\nalight. Leah lay back in her chair with closed eyes, and Lanza stared\nintently at the floor.\n\nA soft knock came at the door, and a female technician hurried in,\ncarrying a tray.\n\n\"I'm sorry to be so slow, Dr. Wong. Dr. Haslam had a little trouble\nlocating the right vial. Oh, and he said to tell you not to worry about\nthose precipitates. They're taken care of.\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" said David. \"Leader Marley, Miss Hachovnik here is very\nill. Won't you let this girl help her to the rest room? She'll be safe\nthere until you're ready for her.\"\n\nMarley looked at the half-fainting woman. \"All right. You take her\nthere, Lanza, and this girl too. Lock them in. And she's not to talk. Do\nyou understand? She's not to talk!\"\n\n\"As you say, Leader Marley,\" the technician whispered. She helped Leah\nto her feet, and Lanza followed them from the room.\n\nMarley closed the door and locked it. \"Now, then, Wong, give me that\nshot, and heaven help you if you try any tricks!\"\n\n\"Will you bare your arm while I prepare the syringe?\"\n\nAwkwardly hanging onto the needler, Marley tugged at his sleeve while\nDavid calmly picked up a bottle of colorless liquid and filled his\nsyringe. He turned to the Leader, swabbed his arm, then picked up the\nsyringe.\n\n\"There you are,\" said David.\n\nJerking the syringe upward, he forced a thin jet of pure alcohol into\nthe man's eyes. Marley screamed. Agonizing pain blinded him, and as he\nclutched at his eyes, David snatched the needler from the writhing\nfingers, and flashed the electronic dagger straight to the heart.\n\nHe stared at the twitching body for only an instant. People were\npounding on the door, shouting. He tugged at the desk drawer to get his\nnotebook, then remembered sickly that he had left his keys in the lab.\nHe would have to leave his notes.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe shouts were growing louder, people were battering the door. Swiftly\nhe moved to the bookcase, swung it away from the wall, and dropped into\ndarkness.\n\nHe brought the bookcase back, then turned and ran along the black\npassageway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeader Lanza sat in his suite at State House, conferring with his\nsubordinates.\n\n\"It hardly seems possible, Magnun, that so many people could have\nslipped through your fingers without help from the Military. You say\nboth the Hachovnik twins have disappeared?\"\n\n\"Yes, Leader.\"\n\n\"And how many people from the Institute?\"\n\n\"Six, Leader. But it didn't do them any good. We got them, all right.\"\n\n\"But you found no bodies!\"\n\n\"They wouldn't _have_ bodies after we got through with them, Leader.\"\n\n\"You're quite certain, Officer Magnun, that all the fugitives were\ndestroyed?\"\n\nLanza looked tired, and his officers noticed in him a lack of firmness,\nan indecision, to which they were not accustomed in a Leader.\n\n\"Say, those babies never had a chance, Leader. We picked up their\nroboplanes somewhere over Kansas, and we shot them out of the air like\nducks. They didn't even fire back. They just crashed, burned,\ndisintegrated. They won't give you any more trouble. Why, we even picked\nup the remains of Doc Wong's wristwatch and that old beat-up pencil case\nof his.\" He flung them on the desk.\n\nLanza fingered the charred and molten relics.\n\n\"That will do, Magnun. I'll call you when I need you.\"\n\n\"Say, ain't you feeling well, Leader? You look kind of green.\"\n\n\"That will be all, Magnun!\"\n\n\"As you say, Leader.\"\n\nLanza shoved aside the charred remnants and spread out the papers\nwaiting for him, the unimportant, miscellaneous notes accumulated over\nthe years by Hudson, Faur\u00e9, and Haslam. And the unreadable notebook of\nDavid Wong. He sighed and looked up as his secretary entered.\n\n\"I'm sorry to disturb you, Leader. You look tired.\"\n\n\"The funeral this morning was quite an ordeal, and so much has happened\nthe last three days!\"\n\n\"Well, I thought you ought to know that strange reports are coming in.\nSome of our most prominent citizens have disappeared. We're trying to\ntrace them, of course, but--\"\n\n\"Anything more?\"\n\n\"Those rumors about Blue Martian are cropping up again.\"\n\n\"Yes? And--?\"\n\n\"That old man you asked me to bring from the Vermont quarries, the one\nwho was detained for illegal study of the Coptic language? Well, I guess\nthe excitement of his release was too much for him. He died of a heart\nattack when he was being taken to the plane.\"\n\nLanza sighed. \"Very well, that will be all.\"\n\nAlone at last, he looked sadly through the pages of David's notebook, at\nthe tantalizing curls and angles of the Coptic letters, cryptic symbols\nof a discovery which prevented a man from growing old. Well, no one\ncould read them now. That secret was dead, along with its discoverer,\nbecause, in this world, no study was permitted without a practical end\nin view. And perhaps it was just as well. Could any man be trusted, he\nwondered, to deal wisely with a power so great?\n\nAfter closing the notebook, he dropped his head into his hands.\n\nHow his head ached! He felt cold, suddenly, and his whole body began to\nshake with a hard chill. He lifted his head, his vision blurred, and\nsuddenly he knew.\n\nHe had Blue Martian fever!\n\nTeeth chattering, he paced wildly about the room, puzzling things out,\ntrying to remember. That booster shot! And then he realized the amazing\ntruth: David Wong had given him a chance! He had inoculated him with the\nseeds of immortality, giving him a chance to help right the wrongs of\nthis Categorized world. And now he was left alone in a world of mortals.\nDavid and the others had been annihilated, and he was left to live on\nand on, alone.\n\nHe staggered toward his private apartments, then sank into his chair as\nhis secretary once again ran into the room. With a supreme effort he\ncontrolled his trembling.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Leader Lanza. Another report.\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" said Lanza, trying to bring his eyes into focus on the\nexcited girl. \"I am in need of a rest. As soon as you have gone, I shall\nretire into seclusion for a few days. There are to be no interruptions.\nIs that clear? Now, proceed.\"\n\n\"There's a new epidemic of Martian Fever reported where one never was\nbefore.\"\n\nHe stirred tiredly. \"Where now?\"\n\n\"South America. Somewhere in the Andes.\"\n\n\"I think we'll have just one Category after this,\" said Lanza dreamily.\n\"Category Phoenix.\"\n\n\"What did you say, Leader?\"\n\nHis thoughts wandered. No wonder Magnun's men found no bodies. The\nplanes they shot down were roboplanes, after all, and it was easy to\nplant in an empty seat a man's wristwatch and his bulky leather pencil\ncase. David and the others were safe now. They were free and had enough\ntime to plan for the new free world.\n\n\"What did you say, Leader?\" the girl repeated, bewildered.\n\n\"Nothing. It doesn't matter.\" He frowned painfully, and then shrugged.\n\"On second thought, I may be away longer than a week. If anyone asks for\nme, say I'm on an Aimless Tramp. I've always hoped that some day I might\nearn the right to a Free Choice.\"\n\n\"But you're the Leader,\" the girl said in astonishment. \"You're entitled\nto all the Free Choices you want!\"\n\nHe lifted his twitching head, smiling wanly. \"It would seem that way,\nwouldn't it? Well, whether I am or not, I think I've really earned a\nFree Choice. I wonder,\" he said in a wistful voice, \"whether the climate\nin the Andes is hospitable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Category Phoenix, by Boyd Ellanby\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CATEGORY PHOENIX ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32427-8.txt or 32427-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/4/2/32427/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
