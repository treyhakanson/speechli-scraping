The gesture was\ninstinctive, for what he feared was nothing a knife could slay, not even\nthe saw-edged crescent blade of the Yuetshi that could disembowel a man\nwith an upward stroke. Neither man nor beast threatened him in the\nsolitude which brooded over the castellated isle of Xapur.\n\nHe had climbed the cliffs, passed through the jungle that bordered them,\nand now stood surrounded by evidences of a vanished state. Broken\ncolumns glimmered among the trees, the straggling lines of crumbling\nwalls meandered off into the shadows, and under his feet were broad\npaves, cracked and bowed by roots growing beneath.\n\nThe fisherman was typical of his race, that strange people whose origin\nis lost in the gray dawn of the past, and who have dwelt in their rude\nfishing huts along the southern shore of the Sea of Vilayet since time\nimmemorial. He was broadly built, with long apish arms and a mighty\nchest, but with lean loins and thin bandy legs. His face was broad, his\nforehead low and retreating, his hair thick and tangled. A belt for a\nknife and a rag for a loin-cloth were all he wore in the way of\nclothing.\n\nThat he was where he was proved that he was less dully incurious than\nmost of his people. Men seldom visited Xapur. It was uninhabited, all\nbut forgotten, merely one among the myriad isles which dotted the great\ninland sea. Men called it Xapur, the Fortified, because of its ruins,\nremnants of some prehistoric kingdom, lost and forgotten before the\nconquering Hyborians had ridden southward. None knew who reared those\nstones, though dim legends lingered among the Yuetshi which half\nintelligibly suggested a connection of immeasurable antiquity between\nthe fishers and the unknown island kingdom.\n\nBut it had been a thousand years since any Yuetshi had understood the\nimport of these tales; they repeated them now as a meaningless formula,\na gibberish framed by their lips by custom. No Yuetshi had come to Xapur\nfor a century. The adjacent coast of the mainland was uninhabited, a\nreedy marsh given over to the grim beasts that haunted it. The fisher's\nvillage lay some distance to the south, on the mainland. A storm had\nblown his frail fishing craft far from his accustomed haunts, and\nwrecked it in a night of flaring lightning and roaring waters on the\ntowering cliffs of the isle. Now in the dawn the sky shone blue and\nclear, the rising sun made jewels of the dripping leaves. He had climbed\nthe cliffs to which he had clung through the night because, in the midst\nof the storm, he had seen an appalling lance of lightning fork out of\nthe black heavens, and the concussion of its stroke, which had shaken\nthe whole island, had been accompanied by a cataclysmic crash that he\ndoubted could have resulted from a riven tree.\n\nA dull curiosity had caused him to investigate; and now he had found\nwhat he sought and an animal-like uneasiness possessed him, a sense of\nlurking peril.\n\nAmong the trees reared a broken dome-like structure, built of gigantic\nblocks of the peculiar iron-like green stone found only on the islands\nof Vilayet. It seemed incredible that human hands could have shaped and\nplaced them, and certainly it was beyond human power to have overthrown\nthe structure they formed. But the thunderbolt had splintered the\nton-heavy blocks like so much glass, reduced others to green dust, and\nripped away the whole arch of the dome.\n\nThe fisherman climbed over the debris and peered in, and what he saw\nbrought a grunt from him. Within the ruined dome, surrounded by\nstone-dust and bits of broken masonry, lay a man on the golden block. He\nwas clad in a sort of skirt and a shagreen girdle. His black hair, which\nfell in a square mane to his massive shoulders, was confined about his\ntemples by a narrow gold band. On his bare, muscular breast lay a\ncurious dagger with a jeweled pommel, shagreen-bound hilt, and a broad\ncrescent blade. It was much like the knife the fisherman wore at his\nhip, but it lacked the serrated edge, and was made with infinitely\ngreater skill.\n\nThe fisherman lusted for the weapon. The man, of course, was dead; had\nbeen dead for many centuries. This dome was his tomb. The fisherman did\nnot wonder by what art the ancients had preserved the body in such a\nvivid likeness of life, which kept the muscular limbs full and\nunshrunken, the dark flesh vital. The dull brain of the Yuetshi had room\nonly for his desire for the knife with its delicate waving lines along\nthe dully gleaming blade.\n\nScrambling down into the dome, he lifted the weapon from the man's\nbreast. And as he did so, a strange and terrible thing came to pass. The\nmuscular dark hands knotted convulsively, the lids flared open,\nrevealing great dark magnetic eyes whose stare struck the startled\nfisherman like a physical blow. He recoiled, dropping the jeweled dagger\nin his perturbation. The man on the dais heaved up to a sitting\nposition, and the fisherman gaped at the full extent of his size, thus\nrevealed. His narrowed eyes held the Yuetshi and in those slitted orbs\nhe read neither friendliness nor gratitude; he saw only a fire as alien\nand hostile as that which burns in the eyes of a tiger.\n\nSuddenly the man rose and towered above him, menace in his every aspect.\nThere was no room in the fisherman's dull brain for fear, at least for\nsuch fear as might grip a man who has just seen the fundamental laws of\nnature defied. As the great hands fell to his shoulders, he drew his\nsaw-edged knife and struck upward with the same motion. The blade\nsplintered against the stranger's corded belly as against a steel\ncolumn, and then the fisherman's thick neck broke like a rotten twig in\nthe giant hands.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nJehungir Agha, lord of Khawarizm and keeper of the coastal border,\nscanned once more the ornate parchment scroll with its peacock seal, and\nlaughed shortly and sardonically.\n\n'Well?' bluntly demanded his counsellor Ghaznavi.\n\nJehungir shrugged his shoulders. He was a handsome man, with the\nmerciless pride of birth and accomplishment.\n\n'The king grows short of patience,' said he. 'In his own hand he\ncomplains bitterly of what he calls my failure to guard the frontier. By\nTarim, if I can not deal a blow to these robbers of the steppes,\nKhawarizm may own a new lord.'\n\nGhaznavi tugged his gray-shot beard in meditation. Yezdigerd, king of\nTuran, was the mightiest monarch in the world. In his palace in the\ngreat port city of Aghrapur was heaped the plunder of empires. His\nfleets of purple-sailed war galleys had made Vilayet an Hyrkanian lake.\nThe dark-skinned people of Zamora paid him tribute, as did the eastern\nprovinces of Koth. The Shemites bowed to his rule as far west as\nShushan. His armies ravaged the borders of Stygia in the south and the\nsnowy lands of the Hyperboreans in the north. His riders bore torch and\nsword westward into Brythunia and Ophir and Corinthia, even to the\nborders of Nemedia. His gilt-helmeted swordsmen had trampled hosts under\ntheir horses' hoofs, and walled cities went up in flames at his\ncommand. In the glutted slave markets of Aghrapur, Sultanapur,\nKhawarizm, Shahpur and Khorusun, women were sold for three small silver\ncoins--blond Brythunians, tawny Stygians, dark-haired Zamorians, ebon\nKushites, olive-skinned Shemites.\n\nYet, while his swift horsemen overthrew armies far from his frontiers,\nat his very borders an audacious foe plucked his beard with a\nred-dripping and smoke-stained hand.\n\nOn the broad steppes between the Sea of Vilayet and the borders of the\neasternmost Hyborian kingdoms, a new race had sprung up in the past\nhalf-century, formed originally of fleeing criminals, broken men,\nescaped slaves, and deserting soldiers. They were men of many crimes and\ncountries, some born on the steppes, some fleeing from the kingdoms in\nthe west. They were called _kozak_, which means wastrel.\n\nDwelling on the wild, open steppes, owning no law but their own peculiar\ncode, they had become a people capable of defying the Grand Monarch.\nCeaselessly they raided the Turanian frontier, retiring in the steppes\nwhen defeated; with the pirates of Vilayet, men of much the same breed,\nthey harried the coast, preying off the merchant ships which plied\nbetween the Hyrkanian ports.\n\n'How am I to crush these wolves?' demanded Jehungir. 'If I follow them\ninto the steppes, I run the risk either of being cut off and destroyed,\nor having them elude me entirely and burn the city in my absence. Of\nlate they have been more daring than ever.'\n\n'That is because of the new chief who has risen among them,' answered\nGhaznavi. 'You know whom I mean.'\n\n'Aye!' replied Jehungir feelingly. 'It is that devil Conan; he is even\nwilder than the _kozaks_, yet he is crafty as a mountain lion.'\n\n'It is more through wild animal instinct than through intelligence,'\nanswered Ghaznavi. 'The other _kozaks_ are at least descendants of\ncivilized men. He is a barbarian. But to dispose of him would be to deal\nthem a crippling blow.'\n\n'But how?' demanded Jehungir. 'He has repeatedly cut his way out of\nspots that seemed certain death for him. And, by instinct or cunning, he\nhas avoided or escaped every trap set for him.'\n\n'For every beast and for every man there is a trap he will not escape,'\nquoth Ghaznavi. 'When we have parleyed with the _kozaks_ for the ransom\nof captives, I have observed this man Conan. He has a keen relish for\nwomen and strong drink. Have your captive Octavia fetched here.'\n\nJehungir clapped his hands, and an impassive Kushite eunuch, an image of\nshining ebony in silken pantaloons, bowed before him and went to do his\nbidding. Presently he returned, leading by the wrist a tall handsome\ngirl, whose yellow hair, clear eyes and fair skin identified her as a\npure-blooded member of her race. Her scanty silk tunic, girded at the\nwaist, displayed the marvelous contours of her magnificent figure. Her\nfine eyes flashed with resentment and her red lips were sulky, but\nsubmission had been taught her during her captivity. She stood with\nhanging head before her master until he motioned her to a seat on the\ndivan beside him. Then he looked inquiringly at Ghaznavi.\n\n'We must lure Conan away from the _kozaks_,' said the counsellor\nabruptly. 'Their war camp is at present pitched somewhere on the lower\nreaches of the Zaporoska River--which, as you well know, is a wilderness\nof reeds, a swampy jungle in which our last expedition was cut to pieces\nby those masterless devils.'\n\n'I am not likely to forget that,' said Jehungir wryly.\n\n'There is an uninhabited island near the mainland,' said Ghaznavi,\n'known as Xapur, the Fortified, because of some ancient ruins upon it.\nThere is a peculiarity about it which makes it perfect for our purpose.\nIt has no shore-line, but rises sheer out of the sea in cliffs a hundred\nand fifty feet tall. Not even an ape could negotiate them. The only\nplace where a man can go up or down is a narrow path on the western side\nthat has the appearance of a worn stair, carved into the solid rock of\nthe cliffs.\n\n'If we could trap Conan on that island, alone, we could hunt him down at\nour leisure, with bows, as men hunt a lion.'\n\n'As well wish for the moon,' said Jehungir impatiently. 'Shall we send\nhim a messenger, bidding him climb the cliffs and await our coming?'\n\n'In effect, yes!' Seeing Jehungir's look of amazement, Ghaznavi\ncontinued: 'We will ask for a parley with the _kozaks_ in regard to\nprisoners, at the edge of the steppes by Fort Ghori. As usual, we will\ngo with a force and encamp outside the castle. They will come, with an\nequal force, and the parley will go forward with the usual distrust and\nsuspicion. But this time we will take with us, as if by casual chance,\nyour beautiful captive.' Octavia changed color and listened with\nintensified interest as the counsellor nodded toward her. 'She will use\nall her wiles to attract Conan's attention. That should not be\ndifficult. To that wild reaver she should appear a dazzling vision of\nloveliness. Her vitality and substantial figure should appeal to him\nmore vividly than would one of the doll-like beauties of your seraglio.'\n\nOctavia sprang up, her white fists clenched, her eyes blazing and her\nfigure quivering with outraged anger.\n\n'You would force me to play the trollop with this barbarian?' she\nexclaimed. 'I will not! I am no market-block slut to smirk and ogle at a\nsteppes-robber. I am the daughter of a Nemedian lord--'\n\n'You were of the Nemedian nobility before my riders carried you off,'\nreturned Jehungir cynically. 'Now you are merely a slave who will do as\nshe is bid.'\n\n'I will not!' she raged.\n\n'On the contrary,' rejoined Jehungir with studied cruelty, 'you will. I\nlike Ghaznavi's plan. Continue, prince among counsellors.'\n\n'Conan will probably wish to buy her. You will refuse to sell her, of\ncourse, or to exchange her for Hyrkanian prisoners. He may then try to\nsteal her, or take her by force--though I do not think even he would\nbreak the parley-truce. Anyway, we must be prepared for whatever he\nmight attempt.\n\n'Then, shortly after the parley, before he has time to forget all about\nher, we will send a messenger to him, under a flag of truce, accusing\nhim of stealing the girl, and demanding her return. He may kill the\nmessenger, but at least he will think that she has escaped.\n\n'Then we will send a spy--a Yuetshi fisherman will do--to the _kozak_\ncamp, who will tell Conan that Octavia is hiding on Xapur. If I know my\nman, he will go straight to that place.'\n\n'But we do not know that he will go alone,' Jehungir argued.\n\n'Does a man take a band of warriors with him, when going to a rendezvous\nwith a woman he desires?' retorted Ghaznavi. 'The chances are all that\nhe _will_ go alone. But we will take care of the other alternative. We\nwill not await him on the island, where we might be trapped ourselves,\nbut among the reeds of a marshy point which juts out to within a\nthousand yards of Xapur. If he brings a large force, we'll beat a\nretreat and think up another plot. If he comes alone or with a small\nparty, we will have him. Depend upon it, he will come, remembering your\ncharming slave's smiles and meaning glances.'\n\n'I will never descend to such shame!' Octavia was wild with fury and\nhumiliation. 'I will die first!'\n\n'You will not die, my rebellious beauty,' said Jehungir, 'but you will\nbe subjected to a very painful and humiliating experience.'\n\nHe clapped his hands, and Octavia paled. This time it was not the\nKushite who entered, but a Shemite, a heavily muscled man of medium\nheight with a short, curled, blue-black beard.\n\n'Here is work for you, Gilzan,' said Jehungir. 'Take this fool, and play\nwith her awhile. Yet be careful not to spoil her beauty.'\n\nWith an inarticulate grunt the Shemite seized Octavia's wrist, and at\nthe grasp of his iron fingers, all the defiance went out of her. With a\npiteous cry she tore away and threw herself on her knees before her\nimplacable master, sobbing incoherently for mercy.\n\nJehungir dismissed the disappointed torturer with a gesture, and said to\nGhaznavi: 'If your plan succeeds, I will fill your lap with gold.'\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nIn the darkness before dawn an unaccustomed sound disturbed the solitude\nthat slumbered over the reedy marshes and the misty waters of the coast.\nIt was not a drowsy water-fowl nor a waking beast. It was a human who\nstruggled through the thick reeds, which were taller than a man's head.\n\nIt was a woman, had there been anyone to see, tall and yellow-haired,\nher splendid limbs molded by her draggled tunic. Octavia had escaped in\ngood earnest, every outraged fiber of her still tingling from her\nexperience in a captivity that had become unendurable.\n\nJehungir's mastery of her had been bad enough; but with deliberate\nfiendishness Jehungir had given her to a nobleman whose name was a\nbyword for degeneracy even in Khawarizm.\n\nOctavia's resilient flesh crawled and quivered at her memories.\nDesperation had nerved her climb from Jelal Khan's castle on a rope made\nof strips from torn tapestries, and chance had led her to a picketed\nhorse. She had ridden all night, and dawn found her with a foundered\nsteed on the swampy shores of the sea. Quivering with the abhorrence of\nbeing dragged back to the revolting destiny planned for her by Jelal\nKhan, she plunged into the morass, seeking a hiding-place from the\npursuit she expected. When the reeds grew thinner around her and the\nwater rose about her thighs, she saw the dim loom of an island ahead of\nher. A broad span of water lay between, but she did not hesitate. She\nwaded out until the low waves were lapping about her waist; then she\nstruck out strongly, swimming with a vigor that promised unusual\nendurance.\n\nAs she neared the island, she saw that it rose sheer from the water in\ncastle-like cliffs. She reached them at last, but found neither ledge to\nstand on below the water, not to cling to above. She swam on, following\nthe curve of the cliffs, the strain of her long flight beginning to\nweight her limbs. Her hands fluttered along the sheer stone, and\nsuddenly they found a depression. With a sobbing gasp of relief, she\npulled herself out of the water and clung there, a dripping white\ngoddess in the dim starlight.\n\nShe had come upon what seemed to be steps carved in the cliff. Up them\nshe went, flattening herself against the stone as she caught the faint\nclack of muffled oars. She strained her eyes and thought she made out a\nvague bulk moving toward the reedy point she had just quitted. But it\nwas too far away for her to be sure, in the darkness, and presently the\nfaint sound ceased, and she continued her climb. If it were her\npursuers, she knew of no better course than to hide on the island. She\nknew that most of the islands off that marshy coast were uninhabited.\nThis might be a pirate's lair, but even pirates would be preferable to\nthe beast she had escaped.\n\nA vagrant thought crossed her mind as she climbed, in which she mentally\ncompared her former master with the _kozak_ chief with whom--by\ncompulsion--she had shamelessly flirted in the pavilions of the camp by\nFort Ghori, where the Hyrkanian lords had parleyed with the warriors of\nthe steppes. His burning gaze had frightened and humiliated her, but his\ncleanly elemental fierceness set him above Jelal Khan, a monster such as\nonly an overly opulent civilization can produce.\n\nShe scrambled up over the cliff edge and looked timidly at the dense\nshadows which confronted her. The trees grew close to the cliffs,\npresenting a solid mass of blackness. Something whirred above her head\nand she cowered, even though realizing it was only a bat.\n\nShe did not like the look of those ebony shadows, but she set her teeth\nand went toward them, trying not to think of snakes. Her bare feet made\nno sound in the spongy loam under the trees. Once among them, the\ndarkness closed frighteningly about her. She had not taken a dozen steps\nwhen she was no longer able to look back and see the cliffs and the sea\nbeyond. A few steps more and she became hopelessly confused and lost her\nsense of direction. Through the tangled branches not even a star peered.\nShe groped and floundered on, blindly, and then came to a sudden halt.\n\nSomewhere ahead there began the rhythmical booming of a drum. It was not\nsuch a sound as she would have expected to hear in that time and place.\nThen she forgot it as she was aware of a presence near her. She could\nnot see, but she knew that something was standing beside her in the\ndarkness.\n\nWith a stifled cry she shrank back, and as she did so, something that\neven in her panic she recognized as a human arm curved about her waist.\nShe screamed and threw all her supple young strength into a wild lunge\nfor freedom, but her captor caught her up like a child, crushing her\nfrantic resistance with ease. The silence with which her frenzied pleas\nand protests were received added to her terror as she felt herself being\ncarried through the darkness toward the distant drum which still pulsed\nand muttered.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAs the first tinge of dawn reddened the sea, a small boat with a\nsolitary occupant approached the cliffs. The man in the boat was a\npicturesque figure. A crimson scarf was knotted about his head; his\nwide silk breeches, of flaming hue, were upheld by a broad sash which\nlikewise supported a scimitar in a shagreen scabbard. His gilt-worked\nleather boots suggested the horseman rather than the seaman, but he\nhandled his boat with skill. Through his widely open white silk shirt\nshowed his broad muscular breast, burned brown by the sun.\n\nThe muscles of his heavy bronzed arms rippled as he pulled the oars with\nan almost feline ease of motion. A fierce vitality that was evident in\neach feature and motion set him apart from common men; yet his\nexpression was neither savage nor somber, though the smoldering blue\neyes hinted at ferocity easily wakened. This was Conan, who had wandered\ninto the armed camps of the _kozaks_ with no other possession than his\nwits and his sword, and who had carved his way to leadership among them.\n\nHe paddled to the carven stair as one familiar with his environs, and\nmoored the boat to a projection of the rock. Then he went up the worn\nsteps without hesitation. He was keenly alert, not because he\nconsciously suspected hidden danger, but because alertness was a part of\nhim, whetted by the wild existence he followed.\n\nWhat Ghaznavi had considered animal intuition or some sixth sense was\nmerely the razor-edge faculties and savage wit of the barbarian. Conan\nhad no instinct to tell him that men were watching him from a covert\namong the reeds of the mainland.\n\nAs he climbed the cliff, one of these men breathed deeply and stealthily\nlifted a bow. Jehungir caught his wrist and hissed an oath into his ear.\n'Fool! Will you betray us? Don't you realize he is out of range? Let him\nget upon the island. He will go looking for the girl. We will stay here\nawhile. He _may_ have sensed our presence or guessed our plot. He may\nhave warriors hidden somewhere. We will wait. In an hour, if nothing\nsuspicious occurs, we'll row up to the foot of the stair and await him\nthere. If he does not return in a reasonable time, some of us will go\nupon the island and hunt him down. But I do not wish to do that if it\ncan be helped. Some of us are sure to die if we have to go into the bush\nafter him. I had rather catch him descending the stair, where we can\nfeather him with arrows from a safe distance.'\n\nMeanwhile the unsuspecting _kozak_ had plunged into the forest. He went\nsilently in his soft leather boots, his gaze sifting every shadow in\neagerness to catch sight of the splendid tawny-haired beauty of whom he\nhad dreamed ever since he had seen her in the pavilion of Jehungir Agha\nby Fort Ghori. He would have desired her even if she had displayed\nrepugnance toward him. But her cryptic smiles and glances had fired his\nblood, and with all the lawless violence which was his heritage he\ndesired that white-skinned golden-haired woman of civilization.\n\nHe had been on Xapur before. Less than a month ago he had held a secret\nconclave here with a pirate crew. He knew that he was approaching a\npoint where he could see the mysterious ruins which gave the island its\nname, and he wondered if he would find the girl hiding among them. Even\nwith the thought he stopped as though struck dead.\n\nAhead of him, among the trees, rose something that his reason told him\nwas not possible. _It was a great dark green wall, with towers rearing\nbeyond the battlements._\n\nConan stood paralyzed in the disruption of the faculties which\ndemoralizes anyone who is confronted by an impossible negation of\nsanity. He doubted neither his sight nor his reason, but something was\nmonstrously out of joint. Less than a month ago only broken ruins had\nshowed among the trees. What human hands could rear such a mammoth pile\nas now met his eyes, in the few weeks which had elapsed? Besides, the\nbuccaneers who roamed Vilayet ceaselessly would have learned of any work\ngoing on on such a stupendous scale, and would have informed the\n_kozaks_.\n\nThere was no explaining this thing, but it was so. He was on Xapur and\nthat fantastic heap of towering masonry was on Xapur, and all was\nmadness and paradox; yet it was all true.\n\nHe wheeled back through the jungle, down the carven stair and across the\nblue waters to the distant camp at the mouth of the Zaporoska. In that\nmoment of unreasoning panic even the thought of halting so near the\ninland sea was repugnant. He would leave it behind him, would quit the\narmed camps and the steppes, and put a thousand miles between him and\nthe blue mysterious East where the most basic laws of nature could be\nset at naught, by what diabolism he could not guess.\n\nFor an instant the future fate of kingdoms that hinged on this gay-clad\nbarbarian hung in the balance. It was a small thing that tipped the\nscales--merely a shred of silk hanging on a bush that caught his uneasy\nglance. He leaned to it, his nostrils expanding, his nerves quivering to\na subtle stimulant. On that bit of torn cloth, so faint that it was less\nwith his physical faculties than by some obscure instinctive sense that\nhe recognized it, lingered the tantalizing perfume that he connected\nwith the sweet firm flesh of the woman he had seen in Jehungir's\npavilion. The fisherman had not lied, then; she _was_ here! Then in the\nsoil he saw a single track of a bare foot, long and slender, but a man's\nnot a woman's, and sunk deeper than was natural. The conclusion was\nobvious; the man who made that track was carrying a burden, and what\nshould it be but the girl the _kozak_ was seeking?\n\nHe stood silently facing the dark towers that loomed through the trees,\nhis eyes slits of blue bale-fire. Desire for the yellow-haired woman\nvied with a sullen primordial rage at whoever had taken her. His human\npassion fought down his ultra-human fears, and dropping into the\nstalking crouch of a hunting panther, he glided toward the walls, taking\nadvantage of the dense foliage to escape detection from the battlements.\n\nAs he approached he saw that the walls were composed of the same green\nstone that had formed the ruins, and he was haunted by a vague sense of\nfamiliarity. It was as if he looked upon something he had never seen\nbefore, but had dreamed of, or pictured mentally. At last he recognized\nthe sensation. The walls and towers followed the plan of the ruins. It\nwas as if the crumbling lines had grown back into the structures they\noriginally were.\n\nNo sound disturbed the morning quiet as Conan stole to the foot of\nthe wall which rose sheer from the luxuriant growth. On the southern\nreaches of the inland sea the vegetation was almost tropical. He saw no\none on the battlements, heard no sounds within. He saw a massive gate a\nshort distance to his left, and had had no reason to suppose that it\nwas not locked and guarded. But he believed that the woman he sought\nwas somewhere beyond that wall, and the course he took was\ncharacteristically reckless.\n\nAbove him vine-festooned branches reached out toward the battlements. He\nwent up a great tree like a cat, and reaching a point above the parapet,\nhe gripped a thick limb with both hands, swung back and forth at arm's\nlength until he had gained momentum, and then let go and catapulted\nthrough the air, landing cat-like on the battlements. Crouching there he\nstared down into the streets of a city.\n\nThe circumference of the wall was not great, but the number of green\nstone buildings it contained was surprizing. They were three or four\nstories in height, mainly flat-roofed, reflecting a fine architectural\nstyle. The streets converged like the spokes of a wheel into an\noctagon-shaped court in the center of the town which gave upon a lofty\nedifice, which, with its domes and towers, dominated the whole city. He\nsaw no one moving in the streets or looking out of the windows, though\nthe sun was already coming up. The silence that reigned there might have\nbeen that of a dead and deserted city. A narrow stone stair ascended the\nwall near him; down this he went.\n\nHouses shouldered so closely to the wall that half-way down the stair he\nfound himself within arm's length of a window, and halted to peer in.\nThere were no bars, and the silk curtains were caught back with satin\ncords. He looked into a chamber whose walls were hidden by dark velvet\ntapestries. The floor was covered with thick rugs, and there were\nbenches of polished ebony, and an ivory dais heaped with furs.\n\nHe was about to continue his descent, when he heard the sound of someone\napproaching in the street below. Before the unknown person could come\nround a corner and see him on the stair, he stepped quickly across the\nintervening space and dropped lightly into the room, drawing his\nscimitar. He stood for an instant statue-like; then as nothing happened\nhe was moving across the rugs toward an arched doorway when a hanging\nwas drawn aside, revealing a cushioned alcove from which a slender,\ndark-haired girl regarded him with languid eyes.\n\nConan glared at her tensely, expecting her momentarily to start\nscreaming. But she merely smothered a yawn with a dainty hand, rose from\nthe alcove and leaned negligently against the hanging which she held\nwith one hand.\n\nShe was undoubtedly a member of a white race, though her skin was very\ndark. Her square-cut hair was black as midnight, her only garment a wisp\nof silk about her supple hips.\n\nPresently she spoke, but the tongue was unfamiliar to him, and he shook\nhis head. She yawned again, stretched lithely, and without any show of\nfear or surprize, shifted to a language he did understand, a dialect of\nYuetshi which sounded strangely archaic.\n\n'Are you looking for someone?' she asked, as indifferently as if the\ninvasion of her chamber by an armed stranger were the most common thing\nimaginable.\n\n'Who are you?' he demanded.\n\n'I am Yateli,' she answered languidly. 'I must have feasted late last\nnight, I am so sleepy now. Who are you?'\n\n'I am Conan, a _hetman_ among the _kozaks_,' he answered, watching her\nnarrowly. He believed her attitude to be a pose, and expected her to try\nto escape from the chamber or rouse the house. But, though a velvet rope\nthat might be a signal cord hung near her, she did not reach for it.\n\n'Conan,' she repeated drowsily. 'You are not a Dagonian. I suppose you\nare a mercenary. Have you cut the heads off many Yuetshi?'\n\n'I do not war on water rats!' he snorted.\n\n'But they are very terrible,' she murmured. 'I remember when they were\nour slaves. But they revolted and burned and slew. Only the magic of\nKhosatral Khel has kept them from the walls--' She paused, a puzzled\nlook struggling with the sleepiness of her expression. 'I forgot,' she\nmuttered. 'They _did_ climb the walls, last night. There was shouting\nand fire, and people calling in vain on Khosatral.' She shook her head\nas if to clear it. 'But that can not be,' she murmured, 'because I am\nalive, and I thought I was dead. Oh, to the devil with it!'\n\nShe came across the chamber, and taking Conan's hand, drew him to the\ndais. He yielded in bewilderment and uncertainty. The girl smiled at\nhim like a sleepy child; her long silky lashes drooped over dusky,\nclouded eyes. She ran her fingers through his thick black locks as if to\nassure herself of his reality.\n\n'It was a dream,' she yawned. 'Perhaps it's all a dream. I feel like a\ndream now. I don't care. I can't remember something--I have\nforgotten--there is something I can not understand, but I grow so sleepy\nwhen I try to think. Anyway, it doesn't matter.'\n\n'What do you mean?' he asked uneasily. 'You said they climbed the walls\nlast night? Who?'\n\n'The Yuetshi. I thought so, anyway. A cloud of smoke hid everything, but\na naked, blood-stained devil caught me by the throat and drove his knife\ninto my breast. Oh, it hurt! But it was a dream, because see, there is\nno scar.' She idly inspected her smooth bosom, and then sank upon\nConan's lap and passed her supple arms around his massive neck. 'I can\nnot remember,' she murmured, nestling her dark head against his mighty\nbreast. 'Everything is dim and misty. It does not matter. You are no\ndream. You are strong. Let us live while we can. Love me!'\n\nHe cradled the girl's glossy head in the bend of his heavy arm, and\nkissed her full red lips with unfeigned relish.\n\n'You are strong,' she repeated, her voice waning. 'Love me--love--' The\nsleepy murmur faded away; the dusky eyes closed, the long lashes\ndrooping over the sensuous cheeks; the supple body relaxed in Conan's\narms.\n\nHe scowled down at her. She seemed to partake of the illusion that\nhaunted this whole city, but the firm resilience of her limbs under his\nquesting fingers convinced him that he had a living human girl in his\narms, and not the shadow of a dream. No less disturbed, he hastily laid\nher on the furs upon the dais. Her sleep was too deep to be natural. He\ndecided that she must be an addict of some drug, perhaps like the black\nlotus of Xuthal.\n\nThen he found something else to make him wonder. Among the furs on the\ndais was a gorgeous spotted skin, whose predominant hue was golden. It\nwas not a clever copy, but the skin of an actual beast. And that beast,\nConan knew, had been extinct for at least a thousand years; it was the\ngreat golden leopard which figures so predominantly in Hyborian\nlegendry, and which the ancient artists delighted to portray in pigments\nand marble.\n\nShaking his head in bewilderment, Conan passed through the archway into\na winding corridor. Silence hung over the house, but outside he heard a\nsound which his keen ears recognized as something ascending the stair on\nthe wall from which he had entered the building. An instant later he was\nstartled to hear something land with a soft but weighty thud on the\nfloor of the chamber he had just quitted. Turning quickly away, he\nhurried along the twisting hallway until something on the floor before\nhim brought him to a halt.\n\nIt was a human figure, which lay half in the hall and half in an opening\nthat obviously was normally concealed by a door which was a duplicate of\nthe panels of the wall. It was a man, dark and lean, clad only in a silk\nloin-cloth, with a shaven head and cruel features, and he lay as if\ndeath had struck him just as he was emerging from the panel. Conan bent\nabove him, seeking the cause of his death, and discovered him to be\nmerely sunk in the same deep sleep as the girl in the chamber.\n\nBut why should he select such a place for his slumbers? While meditating\non the matter, Conan was galvanized by a sound behind him. Something was\nmoving up the corridor in his direction. A quick glance down it showed\nthat it ended in a great door which might be locked. Conan jerked the\nsupine body out of the panel-entrance and stepped through, pulling the\npanel shut after him. A click told him it was locked in place. Standing\nin utter darkness, he heard a shuffling tread halt just outside the\ndoor, and a faint chill trickled along his spine. That was no human\nstep, nor that of any beast he had ever encountered.\n\nThere was an instant of silence, then a faint creak of wood and metal.\nPutting out his hand he felt the door straining and bending inward, as\nif a great weight were being steadily borne against it from the outside.\nAs he reached for his sword, this ceased and he heard a strange\nslobbering mouthing that prickled the short hairs on his scalp. Scimitar\nin hand he began backing away, and his heels felt steps, down which he\nnearly tumbled. He was in a narrow staircase leading downward.\n\nHe groped his way down in the blackness, feeling for, but not finding,\nsome other opening in the walls. Just as he decided that he was no\nlonger in the house, but deep in the earth under it, the steps ceased in\na level tunnel.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAlong the black silent tunnel Conan groped, momentarily dreading a fall\ninto some unseen pit; but at last his feet struck steps again, and he\nwent up them until he came to a door on which his fumbling fingers found\na metal catch. He came out into a dim and lofty room of enormous\nproportions. Fantastic columns marched around the mottled walls,\nupholding a ceiling, which, at once translucent and dusky, seemed like a\ncloudy midnight sky, giving an illusion of impossible height. If any\nlight filtered in from the outside it was curiously altered.\n\nIn a brooding twilight Conan moved across the bare green floor. The\ngreat room was circular, pierced on one side by the great bronze valves\nof a giant door. Opposite this, on a dais against the wall, up to which\nled broad curving steps, there stood a throne of copper, and when Conan\nsaw what was coiled on this throne, he retreated hastily, lifting his\nscimitar.\n\nThen, as the thing did not move, he scanned it more closely, and\npresently mounted the glass steps and stared down at it. It was a\ngigantic snake, apparently carved in some jade-like substance. Each\nscale stood out as distinctly as in real life, and the iridescent colors\nwere vividly reproduced. The great wedge-shaped head was half submerged\nin the folds of its trunk; so neither the eyes nor jaws were visible.\nRecognition stirred in his mind. This snake was evidently meant to\nrepresent one of those grim monsters of the marsh which in past ages had\nhaunted the reedy edges of Vilayet's southern shores. But, like the\ngolden leopard, they had been extinct for hundreds of years. Conan had\nseen rude images of them, in miniature, among the idol-huts of the\nYuetshi, and there was a description of them in the _Book of Skelos_,\nwhich drew on prehistoric sources.\n\nConan admired the scaly torso, thick as his thigh and obviously of great\nlength, and he reached out and laid a curious hand on the thing. And as\nhe did so, his heart nearly stopped. An icy chill congealed the blood in\nhis veins and lifted the short hair on his scalp. Under his hand there\nwas not the smooth, brittle surface of glass or metal or stone, but the\nyielding, fibrous mass of a _living_ thing. He felt cold, sluggish life\nflowing under his fingers.\n\nHis hand jerked back in instinctive repulsion. Sword shaking in his\ngrasp, horror and revulsion and fear almost choking him, he backed away\nand down the glass steps with painful care, glaring in awful fascination\nat the grisly thing that slumbered on the copper throne. It did not\nmove.\n\nHe reached the bronze door and tried it, with his heart in his teeth,\nsweating with fear that he should find himself locked in with that slimy\nhorror. But the valves yielded to his touch, and he glided through and\nclosed them behind him.\n\nHe found himself in a wide hallway with lofty tapestried walls, where\nthe light was the same twilight gloom. It made distant objects\nindistinct and that made him uneasy, rousing thoughts of serpents\ngliding unseen through the dimness. A door at the other end seemed miles\naway in the illusive light. Nearer at hand the tapestry hung in such a\nway as to suggest an opening behind it, and lifting it cautiously he\ndiscovered a narrow stair leading up.\n\nWhile he hesitated he heard in the great room he had just left, the\nsame shuffling tread he had heard outside the locked panel. Had he been\nfollowed through the tunnel? He went up the stair hastily, dropping the\ntapestry in place behind him.\n\nEmerging presently into a twisting corridor, he took the first doorway\nhe came to. He had a twofold purpose in his apparently aimless prowling:\nto escape from the building and its mysteries, and to find the Nemedian\ngirl who, he felt, was imprisoned somewhere in this palace, temple, or\nwhatever it was. He believed it was the great domed edifice in the\ncenter of the city, and it was likely that here dwelt the ruler of the\ntown, to whom a captive woman would doubtless be brought.\n\nHe found himself in a chamber, not another corridor, and was about to\nretrace his steps, when he heard a voice which came from behind one of\nthe walls. There was no door in that wall, but he leaned close and heard\ndistinctly. And an icy chill crawled slowly along his spine. The tongue\nwas Nemedian, but the voice was not human. There was a terrifying\nresonance about it, like a bell tolling at midnight.\n\n'There was no life in the Abyss, save that which was incorporated in\nme,' it tolled. 'Nor was there light, nor motion, nor any sound. Only\nthe urge behind and beyond life guided and impelled me on my upward\njourney, blind, insensate, inexorable. Through ages upon ages, and the\nchangeless strata of darkness I climbed--'\n\nEnsorcelled by that belling resonance, Conan crouched forgetful of all\nelse, until its hypnotic power caused a strange replacement of faculties\nand perception, and sound created the illusion of sight. Conan was no\nlonger aware of the voice, save as far-off rhythmical waves of sound.\nTransported beyond his age and his own individuality, he was seeing the\ntransmutation of the being men called Khosatral Khel which crawled up\nfrom Night and the Abyss ages ago to clothe itself in the substance of\nthe material universe.\n\nBut human flesh was too frail, too paltry to hold the terrific essence\nthat was Khosatral Khel. So he stood up in the shape and aspect of a\nman, but his flesh was not flesh, nor the bone, bone, nor blood, blood.\nHe became a blasphemy against all nature, for he caused to live and\nthink and act a basic substance that before had never known the pulse\nand stir of animate being.\n\nHe stalked through the world like a god, for no earthly weapon could\nharm him, and to him a century was like an hour. In his wanderings he\ncame upon a primitive people inhabiting the island of Dagonia, and it\npleased him to give this race culture and civilization, and by his aid\nthey built the city of Dagon and they abode there and worshipped him.\nStrange and grisly were his servants, called from the dark corners of\nthe planet where grim survivals of forgotten ages yet lurked. His house\nin Dagon was connected with every other house by tunnels through which\nhis shaven-headed priests bore victims for the sacrifice.\n\nBut after many ages a fierce and brutish people appeared on the shores\nof the sea. They called themselves Yuetshi, and after a fierce battle\nthey were defeated and enslaved, and for nearly a generation they died\non the altars of Khosatral.\n\nHis sorcery kept them in bonds. Then their priest, a strange gaunt man\nof unknown race, plunged into the wilderness, and when he returned he\nbore a knife that was of no earthly substance. It was forged of a meteor\nwhich flashed through the sky like a flaming arrow and fell in a far\nvalley. The slaves rose. Their saw-edged crescents cut down the men of\nDagon like sheep, and against that unearthly knife the magic of\nKhosatral was impotent. While carnage and slaughter bellowed through the\nred smoke that choked the streets, the grimmest act of that grim drama\nwas played in the cryptic dome behind the great daised chamber with its\ncopper throne and its walls mottled like the skin of serpents.\n\nFrom that dome the Yuetshi priest emerged alone. He had not slain his\nfoe, because he wished to hold the threat of his losing over the heads\nof his own rebellious subjects. He had left Khosatral lying upon the\ngolden dais with the mystic knife across his breast for a spell to hold\nhim senseless and inanimate until doomsday.\n\nBut the ages passed and the priest died, the towers of deserted Dagon\ncrumbled, the tales became dim, and the Yuetshi were reduced by plagues\nand famines and war to scattered remnants, dwelling in squalor along the\nseashore.\n\nOnly the cryptic dome resisted the rot of time, until a chance\nthunderbolt and the curiosity of a fisherman lifted from the breast of\nthe god the magic knife and broke the spell. Khosatral Khel rose and\nlived and waxed mighty once more. It pleased him to restore the city as\nit was in the days before its fall. By his necromancy he lifted the\ntowers from the dust of forgotten millenniums, and the folk which had\nbeen dust for ages moved in life again.\n\nBut folk who have tasted death are only partly alive. In the dark\ncorners of their souls and minds death still lurks unconquered. By night\nthe people of Dagon moved and loved, hated and feasted, and remembered\nthe fall of Dagon and their own slaughter only as a dim dream; they\nmoved in an enchanted mist of illusion, feeling the strangeness of their\nexistence but not inquiring the reasons therefor. With the coming of day\nthey sank into deep sleep, to be roused again only by the coming of\nnight, which is akin to death.\n\nAll this rolled in a terrible panorama before Conan's consciousness as\nhe crouched beside the tapestried wall. His reason staggered. All\ncertainty and sanity were swept away, leaving a shadowy universe through\nwhich stole hooded figures of grisly potentialities. Through the belling\nof the voice which was like a tolling of triumph over the ordered laws\nof a sane planet, a human sound anchored Conan's mind from its flight\nthrough spheres of madness. It was the hysterical sobbing of a woman.\n\nInvoluntarily he sprang up.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nJehungir Agha waited with growing impatience in his boat among the\nreeds. More than an hour passed, and Conan had not reappeared. Doubtless\nhe was still searching the island for the girl he thought to be hidden\nthere. But another surmise occurred to the Agha. Suppose the _hetman_\nhad left his warriors near by, and that they should grow suspicious and\ncome to investigate his long absence? Jehungir spoke to the oarsmen, and\nthe long boat slid from among the reeds and glided toward the carven\nstairs.\n\nLeaving half a dozen men in the boat, he took the rest, ten mighty\narchers of Khawarizm, in spired helmets and tiger-skin cloaks. Like\nhunters invading the retreat of the lion, they stole forward under the\ntrees, arrows on string. Silence reigned over the forest except when a\ngreat green thing that might have been a parrot swirled over their heads\nwith a low thunder of broad wings, and then sped off through the trees.\nWith a sudden gesture Jehungir halted his party, and they stared\nincredulously at the towers that showed through the verdure in the\ndistance.\n\n'Tarim!' muttered Jehungir. 'The pirates have rebuilt the ruins!\nDoubtless Conan is there. We must investigate this. A fortified town\nthis close to the mainland!--Come!'\n\nWith renewed caution they glided through the trees. The game had\naltered; from pursuers and hunters they had become spies.\n\nAnd as they crept through the tangled growth, the man they sought was in\nperil more deadly than their filigreed arrows.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConan realized with a crawling of his skin that beyond the wall the\nbelling voice had ceased. He stood motionless as a statue, his gaze\nfixed on a curtained door through which he knew that a culminating\nhorror would presently appear.\n\nIt was dim and misty in the chamber, and Conan's hair began to lift on\nhis scalp as he looked. He saw a head and a pair of gigantic shoulders\ngrow out of the twilight gloom. There was no sound of footsteps, but the\ngreat dusky form grew more distinct until Conan recognized the figure of\na man. He was clad in sandals, a skirt and a broad shagreen girdle. His\nsquare-cut mane was confined by a circlet of gold. Conan stared at the\nsweep of the monstrous shoulders, the breadth of the swelling breast,\nthe bands and ridges and clusters of muscles on torso and limbs. The\nface was without weakness and without mercy. The eyes were balls of dark\nfire. And Conan knew that this was Khosatral Khel, the ancient from the\nAbyss, the god of Dagonia.\n\nNo word was spoken. No word was necessary. Khosatral spread his great\narms, and Conan, crouching beneath them, slashed at the giant's belly.\nThen he bounded back, eyes blazing with surprise. The keen edge had rung\non the mighty body as on an anvil, rebounding without cutting. Then\nKhosatral came upon him in an irresistible surge.\n\nThere was a fleeting concussion, a fierce writhing and intertwining of\nlimbs and bodies, and then Conan sprang clear, every thew quivering from\nthe violence of his efforts; blood started where the grazing fingers had\ntorn the skin. In that instant of contact he had experienced the\nultimate madness of blasphemed nature; no human flesh had bruised his,\nbut _metal_ animated and sentient; it was a body of living iron which\nopposed his.\n\nKhosatral loomed above the warrior in the gloom. Once let those great\nfingers lock and they would not loosen until the human body hung limp in\ntheir grasp. In that twilit chamber it was as if a man fought with a\ndream-monster in a nightmare.\n\nFlinging down his useless sword, Conan caught up a heavy bench and\nhurled it with all his power. It was such a missile as few men could\neven lift. On Khosatral's mighty breast it smashed into shreds and\nsplinters. It did not even shake the giant on his braced legs. His face\nlost something of its human aspect, a nimbus of fire played about his\nawesome head, and like a moving tower he came on.\n\nWith a desperate wrench Conan ripped a whole section of tapestry from\nthe wall and whirling it, with a muscular effort greater than that\nrequired for throwing the bench, he flung it over the giant's head. For\nan instant Khosatral floundered, smothered and blinded by the clinging\nstuff that resisted his strength as wood or steel could not have done,\nand in that instant Conan caught up his scimitar and shot out into the\ncorridor. Without checking his speed he hurled himself through the door\nof the adjoining chamber, slammed the door and shot the bolt.\n\nThen as he wheeled he stopped short, all the blood in him seeming to\nsurge to his head. Crouching on a heap of silk cushions, golden hair\nstreaming over her naked shoulders, eyes blank with terror, was the\nwoman for whom he had dared so much. He almost forgot the horror at his\nheels until a splintering crash behind him brought him to his senses. He\ncaught up the girl and sprang for the opposite door. She was too\nhelpless with fright either to resist or to aid him. A faint whimper was\nthe only sound of which she seemed capable.\n\nConan wasted no time trying the door. A shattering stroke of his\nscimitar hewed the lock asunder, and as he sprang through to the stair\nthat loomed beyond it, he saw the head and shoulders of Khosatral crash\nthrough the other door. The colossus was splintering the massive panels\nas if they were of cardboard.\n\nConan raced up the stair, carrying the big girl over one shoulder as\neasily as if she had been a child. Where he was going he had no idea,\nbut the stair ended at the door of a round, domed chamber. Khosatral was\ncoming up the stair behind them, silently as a wind of death, and as\nswiftly.\n\nThe chamber's walls were of solid steel, and so was the door. Conan shut\nit and dropped in place the great bars with which it was furnished. The\nthought struck him that this was Khosatral's chamber, where he locked\nhimself in to sleep securely from the monsters he had loosed from the\nPits to do his bidding.\n\nHardly were the bolts in place when the great door shook and trembled to\nthe giant's assault. Conan shrugged his shoulders. This was the end of\nthe trail. There was no other door in the chamber, nor any window. Air,\nand the strange misty light, evidently came from interstices in the\ndome. He tested the nickel edge of his scimitar, quite cool now that he\nwas at bay. He had done his volcanic best to escape; when the giant came\ncrashing through that door he would explode in another savage onslaught\nwith his useless sword, not because he expected it to do any good, but\nbecause it was his nature to die fighting. For the moment there was no\ncourse of action to take, and his calmness was not forced or feigned.\n\nThe gaze he turned on his fair companion was as admiring and intense as\nif he had a hundred years to live. He had dumped her unceremoniously on\nthe floor when he turned to close the door, and she had risen to her\nknees, mechanically arranging her streaming locks and her scanty\ngarment. Conan's fierce eyes glowed with approval as they devoured her\nthick golden hair, her clear wide eyes, her milky skin, sleek with\nexuberant health, the firm swell of her breasts, the contours of her\nsplendid hips.\n\nA low cry escaped her as the door shook and a bolt gave way with a\ngroan.\n\nConan did not look around. He knew the door would hold a little while\nlonger.\n\n'They told me you had escaped,' he said. 'A Yuetshi fisher told me you\nwere hiding here. What is your name?'\n\n'Octavia,' she gasped mechanically. Then words came in a rush. She\ncaught at him with desperate fingers. 'Oh Mitra! what nightmare is this?\nThe people--the dark-skinned people--one of them caught me in the forest\nand brought me here. They carried me to--to that--that _thing_. He told\nme--he said--am I mad? Is this a dream?'\n\nHe glanced at the door which bulged inward as if from the impact of a\nbattering-ram.\n\n'No,' he said, 'it's no dream. That hinge is giving way. Strange that a\ndevil has to break down a door like a common man; but after all, his\nstrength itself is a diabolism.'\n\n'Can you not kill him?' she panted. 'You are strong.'\n\nConan was too honest to lie. 'If a mortal man could kill him, he'd be\ndead now,' he answered. 'I nicked my blade on his belly.'\n\nHer eyes dulled. 'Then you must die, and I must--oh Mitra!' she screamed\nin sudden frenzy, and Conan caught her hands, fearing that she would\nharm herself. 'He told me what he was going to do to me!' she panted.\n'Kill me! Kill me with your sword before he bursts the door!'\n\nConan looked at her, and shook his head.\n\n'I'll do what I can,' he said. 'That won't be much, but it'll give you a\nchance to get past him down the stair. Then run for the cliffs. I have a\nboat tied at the foot of the steps. If you can get out of the palace you\nmay escape him yet. The people of this city are all asleep.'\n\nShe dropped her head in her hands. Conan took up his scimitar and moved\nover to stand before the echoing door. One watching him would have\nrealized that he was waiting for a death he regarded as inevitable. His\neyes smoldered more vividly; his muscular hand knotted harder on his\nhilt; that was all.\n\nThe hinges had given under the giant's terrible assault and the door\nrocked crazily, held only by the bolts. And these solid steel bars were\nbuckling, bending, bulging out of their sockets. Conan watched in an\nalmost impersonal fascination, envying the monster his inhuman strength.\n\nThen without warning the bombardment ceased. In the stillness Conan\nheard other noises on the landing outside--the beat of wings, and a\nmuttering voice that was like the whining of wind through midnight\nbranches. Then presently there was silence, but there was a new _feel_\nin the air. Only the whetted instincts of barbarism could have sensed\nit, but Conan knew, without seeing or hearing him leave, that the master\nof Dagon no longer stood outside the door.\n\nHe glared through a crack that had been started in the steel of the\nportal. The landing was empty. He drew the warped bolts and cautiously\npulled aside the sagging door. Khosatral was not on the stair, but far\nbelow he heard the clang of a metal door. He did not know whether the\ngiant was plotting new devilries or had been summoned away by that\nmuttering voice, but he wasted no time in conjectures.\n\nHe called to Octavia, and the new note in his voice brought her up to\nher feet and to his side almost without her conscious volition.\n\n'What is it?' she gasped.\n\n'Don't stop to talk!' He caught her wrist. 'Come on!' The chance for\naction had transformed him; his eyes blazed, his voice crackled. 'The\nknife!' he muttered, while almost dragging the girl down the stair in\nhis fierce haste. 'The magic Yuetshi blade! He left it in the dome! I--'\nhis voice died suddenly as a clear mental picture sprang up before him.\nThe dome adjoined the great room where stood the copper throne--sweat\nstarted out on his body. The only way to that dome was through that room\nwith its copper throne and the foul thing that slumbered in it.\n\nBut he did not hesitate. Swiftly they descended the stair, crossed the\nchamber, descended the next stair, and came into the great dim hall with\nits mysterious hangings. They had seen no sign of the colossus. Halting\nbefore the great bronze-valved door, Conan caught Octavia by her\nshoulders and shook her in his intensity.\n\n'Listen!' he snapped. 'I'm going into that room and fasten the door.\nStand here and listen; if Khosatral comes, call to me. If you hear me\ncry for you to go, run as though the devil were on your heels--which he\nprobably will be. Make for that door at the other end of the hall,\nbecause I'll be past helping you. I'm going for the Yuetshi knife!'\n\nBefore she could voice the protest her lips were framing, he had slid\nthrough the valves and shut them behind him. He lowered the bolt\ncautiously, not noticing that it could be worked from the outside. In\nthe dim twilight his gaze sought that grim copper throne; yes, the scaly\nbrute was still there, filling the throne with its loathsome coils. He\nsaw a door behind the throne and knew that it led into the dome. But to\nreach it he must mount the dais, a few feet from the throne itself.\n\nA wind blowing across the green floor would have made more noise than\nConan's slinking feet. Eyes glued on the sleeping reptile he reached the\ndais and mounted the glass steps. The snake had not moved. He was\nreaching for the door....\n\nThe bolt on the bronze portal clanged and Conan stifled an awful oath as\nhe saw Octavia come into the room. She stared about, uncertain in the\ndeeper gloom, and he stood frozen, not daring to shout a warning. Then\nshe saw his shadowy figure and ran toward the dais, crying: 'I want to\ngo with you! I'm afraid to stay alone--_oh_! She threw up her hands\nwith a terrible scream as for the first time she saw the occupant of the\nthrone. The wedge-shaped head had lifted from its coils and thrust out\ntoward her on a yard of shining neck.\n\nConan cleared the space between him and the throne with a desperate\nbound, his scimitar swinging with all his power. And with such blinding\nspeed did the serpent move that it whipped about and met him in full\nmidair, lapping his limbs and body with half a dozen coils. His\nhalf-checked stroke fell futilely as he crashed down on the dais,\ngashing the scaly trunk but not severing it.\n\nThen he was writhing on the glass steps with fold after slimy fold\nknotting about him, twisting, crushing, killing him. His right arm was\nstill free, but he could get no purchase to strike a killing blow, and\nhe knew one blow must suffice. With a groaning convulsion of muscular\nexpansion that bulged his veins almost to bursting on his temples and\ntied his muscles in quivering, tortured knots, he heaved up on his feet,\nlifting almost the full weight of that forty-foot devil.\n\nAn instant he reeled on wide-braced legs, feeling his ribs caving in on\nhis vitals and his sight growing dark, while his scimitar gleamed above\nhis head. Then it fell, shearing through the scales and flesh and\nvertebrae. And where there had been one huge writhing cable, now there\nwere horribly two, lashing and flopping in the death throes. Conan\nstaggered away from their blind strokes. He was sick and dizzy, and\nblood oozed from his nose. Groping in a dark mist he clutched Octavia\nand shook her until she gasped for breath.\n\n'Next time I tell you to stay somewhere,' he gasped, 'you stay!'\n\nHe was too dizzy even to know whether she replied. Taking her wrist like\na truant schoolgirl, he led her around the hideous stumps that still\nlooped and knotted on the floor. Somewhere, in the distance, he thought\nhe heard men yelling, but his ears were still roaring so that he could\nnot be sure.\n\nThe door gave to his efforts. If Khosatral had placed the snake there to\nguard the thing he feared, evidently he considered it ample precaution.\nConan half expected some other monstrosity to leap at him with the\nopening of the door, but in the dimmer light he saw only the vague sweep\nof the arch above, a dully gleaming block of gold, and a half-moon\nglimmer on the stone.\n\nWith a gasp of gratification he scooped it up, and did not linger for\nfurther exploration. He turned and fled across the room and down the\ngreat hall toward the distant door that he felt led to the outer air. He\nwas correct. A few minutes later he emerged into the silent streets,\nhalf carrying, half guiding his companion. There was no one to be seen,\nbut beyond the western wall there sounded cries and moaning wails that\nmade Octavia tremble. He led her to the southwestern wall, and without\ndifficulty found a stone stair that mounted the rampart. He had\nappropriated a thick tapestry rope in the great hall, and now, having\nreached the parapet, he looped the soft strong cord about the girl's\nhips and lowered her to the earth. Then, making one end fast to a\nmerlon, he slid down after her. There was but one way of escape from the\nisland--the stair on the western cliffs. In that direction he hurried,\nswinging wide around the spot from which had come the cries and the\nsound of terrible blows.\n\nOctavia sensed that grim peril lurked in those leafy fastnesses. Her\nbreath came pantingly and she pressed close to her protector. But the\nforest was silent now, and they saw no shape of menace until they\nemerged from the trees and glimpsed a figure standing on the edge of the\ncliffs.\n\nJehungir Agha had escaped the doom that had overtaken his warriors when\nan iron giant sallied suddenly from the gate and battered and crushed\nthem into bits of shredded flesh and splintered bone. When he saw the\nswords of his archers break on that man-like juggernaut, he had known it\nwas no human foe they faced, and he had fled, hiding in the deep woods\nuntil the sounds of slaughter ceased. Then he crept back to the stair,\nbut his boatmen were not waiting for him.\n\nThey had heard the screams, and presently, waiting nervously, had seen,\non the cliff above them, a blood-smeared monster waving gigantic arms in\nawful triumph. They had waited for no more. When Jehungir came upon the\ncliffs they were just vanishing among the reeds beyond ear-shot.\nKhosatral was gone--had either returned to the city or was prowling the\nforest in search of the man who had escaped him outside the walls.\n\nJehungir was just preparing to descend the stairs and depart in Conan's\nboat, when he saw the _hetman_ and the girl emerge from the trees. The\nexperience which had congealed his blood and almost blasted his reason\nhad not altered Jehungir's intentions toward the _kozak_ chief. The\nsight of the man he had come to kill filled him with gratification. He\nwas astonished to see the girl he had given to Jelal Khan, but he wasted\nno time on her. Lifting his bow he drew the shaft to its head and\nloosed. Conan crouched and the arrow splintered on a tree, and Conan\nlaughed.\n\n'Dog!' he taunted. 'You can't hit me! I was not born to die on Hyrkanian\nsteel! Try again, pig of Turan!'\n\nJehungir did not try again. That was his last arrow. He drew his\nscimitar and advanced, confident in his spired helmet and close-meshed\nmail. Conan met him half-way in a blinding whirl of swords. The curved\nblades ground together, sprang apart, circled in glittering arcs that\nblurred the sight which tried to follow them. Octavia, watching, did not\nsee the stroke, but she heard its chopping impact, and saw Jehungir\nfall, blood spurting from his side where the Cimmerian's steel had\nsundered his mail and bitten to his spine.\n\nBut Octavia's scream was not caused by the death of her former master.\nWith a crash of bending boughs Khosatral Khel was upon them. The girl\ncould not flee; a moaning cry escaped her as her knees gave way and\npitched her grovelling to the sward.\n\nConan, stooping above the body of the Agha, made no move to escape.\nShifting his reddened scimitar to his left hand, he drew the great\nhalf-blade of the Yuetshi. Khosatral Khel was towering above him, his\narms lifted like mauls, but as the blade caught the sheen of the sun,\nthe giant gave back suddenly.\n\nBut Conan's blood was up. He rushed in, slashing with the crescent\nblade. And it did not splinter. Under its edge the dusky metal of\nKhosatral's body gave way like common flesh beneath a cleaver. From the\ndeep gash flowed a strange ichor, and Khosatral cried out like the\ndirging of a great bell. His terrible arms flailed down, but Conan,\nquicker than the archers who had died beneath those awful flails,\navoided their strokes and struck again and yet again. Khosatral reeled\nand tottered; his cries were awful to hear, as if metal were given a\ntongue of pain, as if iron shrieked and bellowed under torment.\n\nThen wheeling away he staggered into the forest; he reeled in his gait,\ncrashed through bushes and caromed off trees. Yet though Conan followed\nhim with the speed of hot passion, the walls and towers of Dagon loomed\nthrough the trees before the man came within dagger-reach of the giant.\n\nThen Khosatral turned again, flailing the air with desperate blows, but\nConan, fired to berserk fury, was not to be denied. As a panther strikes\ndown a bull moose at bay, so he plunged under the bludgeoning arms and\ndrove the crescent blade to the hilt under the spot where a human's\nheart would be.\n\nKhosatral reeled and fell. In the shape of a man he reeled, but it was\nnot the shape of a man that struck the loam. Where there had been the\nlikeness of a human face, there was no face at all, and the metal limbs\nmelted and changed.... Conan, who had not shrunk from Khosatral living,\nrecoiled blenching from Khosatral dead, for he had witnessed an awful\ntransmutation; in his dying throes Khosatral Khel had become again the\n_thing_ that had crawled up from the Abyss millenniums gone. Gagging\nwith intolerable repugnance, Conan turned to flee the sight; and he was\nsuddenly aware that the pinnacles of Dagon no longer glimmered through\nthe trees. They had faded like smoke--the battlements, the crenellated\ntowers, the great bronze gates, the velvets, the gold, the ivory, and\nthe dark-haired women, and the men with their shaven skulls. With the\npassing of the inhuman intellect which had given them rebirth, they had\nfaded back into the dust which they had been for ages uncounted. Only\nthe stumps of broken columns rose above crumbling walls and broken paves\nand shattered dome. Conan again looked upon the ruins of Xapur as he\nremembered them.\n\nThe wild _hetman_ stood like a statue for a space, dimly grasping\nsomething of the cosmic tragedy of the fitful ephemera called mankind\nand the hooded shapes of darkness which prey upon it. Then as he heard\nhis name called in accents of fear, he started, as one awaking from a\ndream, glanced again at the thing on the ground, shuddered and turned\naway toward the cliffs and the girl that waited there.\n\nShe was peering fearfully under the trees, and she greeted him with a\nhalf-stifled cry of relief. He had shaken off the dim monstrous visions\nwhich had momentarily haunted him, and was his exuberant self again.\n\n'Where is _he_?' she shuddered.\n\n'Gone back to hell whence he crawled,' he replied cheerfully. 'Why\ndidn't you climb the stair and make your escape in my boat?'\n\n'I wouldn't desert--' she began, then changed her mind, and amended\nrather sulkily, 'I have nowhere to go. The Hyrkanians would enslave me\nagain, and the pirates would--'\n\n'What of the _kozaks_?' he suggested.\n\n'Are they better than the pirates?' she asked scornfully. Conan's\nadmiration increased to see how well she had recovered her poise after\nhaving endured such frantic terror. Her arrogance amused him.\n\n'You seemed to think so in the camp by Ghori,' he answered. 'You were\nfree enough with your smiles then.'\n\nHer red lip curled in disdain. 'Do you think I was enamored of you? Do\nyou dream that I would have shamed myself before an ale-guzzling,\nmeat-gorging barbarian unless I had to? My master--whose body lies\nthere--forced me to do as I did.'\n\n'Oh!' Conan seemed rather crestfallen. Then he laughed with undiminished\nzest. 'No matter. You belong to me now. Give me a kiss.'\n\n'You dare ask--' she began angrily, when she felt herself snatched off\nher feet and crushed to the _hetman's_ muscular breast. She fought him\nfiercely, with all the supple strength of her magnificent youth, but he\nonly laughed exuberantly, drunk with his possession of this splendid\ncreature writhing in his arms.\n\nHe crushed her struggles easily, drinking the nectar of her lips with\nall the unrestrained passion that was his, until the arms that strained\nagainst him melted and twined convulsively about his massive neck. Then\nhe laughed down into the clear eyes, and said: 'Why should not a chief\nof the Free People be preferable to a city-bred dog of Turan?'\n\nShe shook back her tawny locks, still tingling in every nerve from the\nfire of his kisses. She did not loosen her arms from his neck. 'Do you\ndeem yourself an Agha's equal?' she challenged.\n\nHe laughed and strode with her in his arms toward the stair. 'You shall\njudge,' he boasted. 'I'll burn Khawarizm for a torch to light your way\nto my tent.'\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Devil in Iron, by Robert E.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
