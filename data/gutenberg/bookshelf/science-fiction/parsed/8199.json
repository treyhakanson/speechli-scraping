The newsboys cried \"Extra!\" as they had done a\nthousand times for murders, battles, fires, and Wall Street panics,\nbut nobody was excited. In fact, the reports at first seemed so\nexaggerated and improbable that hardly anybody believed a word of\nthem. Who could have been expected to credit a despatch, forwarded by\ncable from New Zealand, and signed by an unknown name, which contained\nsuch a statement as this:\n\n\"A seam of gold which can be cut with a knife has been found within\nten miles of the south pole.\"\n\nThe discovery of the pole itself had been announced three years\nbefore, and several scientific parties were known to be exploring the\nremarkable continent that surrounds it. But while they had sent home\nmany highly interesting reports, there had been nothing to suggest the\npossibility of such an amazing discovery as that which was now\nannounced.  Accordingly, most sensible people looked upon the New\nZealand despatch as a hoax.\n\nBut within a week, and from a different source, flashed another\ndespatch which more than confirmed the first. It declared that gold\nexisted near the south pole in practically unlimited quantity. Some\ngeologists said this accounted for the greater depth of the Antarctic\nOcean. It had always been noticed that the southern hemisphere\nappeared to be a little overweighted. People now began to prick up\ntheir ears, and many letters of inquiry appeared in the newspapers\nconcerning the wonderful tidings from the south. Some asked for\ninformation about the shortest route to the new goldfields.\n\nIn a little while several additional reports came, some via New\nZealand, others via South America, and all confirming in every respect\nwhat had been sent before. Then a New York newspaper sent a swift\nsteamer to the Antarctic, and when this enterprising journal published\na four-page cable describing the discoveries in detail, all doubt\nvanished and the rush began.\n\nSome time I may undertake a description of the wild scenes that\noccurred when, at last, the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere\nwere convinced that boundless stores of gold existed in the unclaimed\nand uninhabited wastes surrounding the south pole. But at present I\nhave something more wonderful to relate.\n\nLet me briefly depict the situation.\n\nFor many years silver had been absent from the coinage of the\nworld. Its increasing abundance rendered it unsuitable for money,\nespecially when contrasted with gold. The \"silver craze,\" which had\nraged in the closing decade of the nineteenth century, was already a\nforgotten incident of financial history. The gold standard had become\nuniversal, and business all over the earth had adjusted itself to that\ncondition. The wheels of industry ran smoothly, and there seemed to be\nno possibility of any disturbance or interruption. The common monetary\nsystem prevailing in every land fostered trade and facilitated the\nexchange of products. Travellers never had to bother their heads about\nthe currency of money; any coin that passed in New York would pass for\nits face value in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Madrid, St. Petersburg,\nConstantinople, Cairo, Khartoum, Jerusalem, Peking, or Yeddo. It was\nindeed the \"Golden Age,\" and the world had never been so free from\nfinancial storms.\n\nUpon this peaceful scene the south polar gold discoveries burst like\nan unheralded tempest.\n\nI happened to be in the company of a famous bank president when the\nconfirmation of those discoveries suddenly filled the streets with\nyelling newsboys.  \"Get me one of those 'extras'!\" he said, and an\noffice-boy ran out to obey him. As he perused the sheet his face\ndarkened.\n\n\"I'm afraid it's too true,\" he said, at length. \"Yes, there seems to\nbe no getting around it. Gold is going to be as plentiful as iron. If\nthere were not such a flood of it, we might manage, but when they\nbegin to make trousers buttons out of the same metal that is now\nlocked and guarded in steel vaults, where will be our standard of\nworth? My dear fellow,\" he continued, impulsively laying his hand on\nmy arm, \"I would as willingly face the end of the world as this that's\ncoming!\"\n\n\"You think it so bad, then?\" I asked. \"But most people will not agree\nwith you. They will regard it as very good news.\"\n\n\"How can it be good?\" he burst out. \"What have we got to take the\nplace of gold? Can we go back to the age of barter? Can we substitute\ncattle-pens and wheat-bins for the strong boxes of the Treasury? Can\ncommerce exist with no common measure of exchange?\"\n\n\"It does indeed look serious,\" I assented.\n\n\"Serious! I tell you, it is the deluge!\"\n\nThereat he clapped on his hat and hurried across the street to the\noffice of another celebrated banker.\n\nHis premonitions of disaster turned out to be but too well grounded.\nThe deposits of gold at the south pole were richer than the wildest\nreports had represented them. The shipments of the precious metal to\nAmerica and Europe soon became enormous--so enormous that the metal\nwas no longer precious. The price of gold dropped like a falling\nstone, with accelerated velocity, and within a year every money centre\nin the world had been swept by a panic. Gold was more common than\niron. Every government was compelled to demonetize it, for when once\ngold had fallen into contempt it was less valuable in the eyes of the\npublic than stamped paper. For once the world had thoroughly learned\nthe lesson that too much of a good thing is worse than none of it.\n\nThen somebody found a new use for gold by inventing a process by which\nit could be hardened and tempered, assuming a wonderful toughness and\nelasticity without losing its non-corrosive property, and in this form\nit rapidly took the place of steel.\n\nIn the mean time every effort was made to bolster up credit. Endless\nwere the attempts to find a substitute for gold. The chemists sought\nit in their laboratories and the mineralogists in the mountains and\ndeserts. Platinum might have served, but it, too, had become a drug in\nthe market through the discovery of immense deposits. Out of the\ntwenty odd elements which had been rarer and more valuable than gold,\nsuch as uranium, gallium, etc., not one was found to answer the\npurpose. In short, it was evident that since both gold and silver had\nbecome too abundant to serve any longer for a money standard, the\nplanet held no metal suitable to take their place.\n\nThe entire monetary system of the world must be readjusted, but in the\nreadjustment it was certain to fall to pieces. In fact, it had already\nfallen to pieces; the only recourse was to paper money, but whether\nthis was based upon agriculture or mining or manufacture, it gave\nvarying standards, not only among the different nations, but in\nsuccessive years in the same country. Exports and imports practically\nceased. Credit was discredited, commerce perished, and the world, at a\nbound, seemed to have gone back, financially and industrially, to the\ndark ages.\n\nOne final effort was made. A great financial congress was assembled at\nNew York. Representatives of all the nations took part in it. The\nablest financiers of Europe and America united the efforts of their\ngenius and the results of their experience to solve the great\nproblem. The various governments all solemnly stipulated to abide by\nthe decision of the congress.\n\nBut, after spending months in hard but fruitless labor, that body was\nno nearer the end of its undertaking than when it first assembled. The\nentire world awaited its decision with bated breath, and yet the\ndecision was not formed.\n\nAt this paralyzing crisis a most unexpected event suddenly opened the\nway.\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE MAGICIAN OF SCIENCE\n\nAn attendant entered the room where the perplexed financiers were in\nsession and presented a peculiar-looking card to the president,\nMr. Boon. The president took the card in his hand and instantly fell\ninto a brown study. So complete was his absorption that Herr Finster,\nthe celebrated Berlin banker, who had been addressing the chair for\nthe last two hours from the opposite end of the long table, got\nconfused, entirely lost track of his verb, and suddenly dropped into\nhis seat, very red in the face and wearing a most injured expression.\n\nBut President Boon paid no attention except to the singular card,\nwhich he continued to turn over and over, balancing it on his fingers\nand holding it now at arm's-length and then near his nose, with one\neye squinted as if he were trying to look through a hole in the card.\n\nAt length this odd conduct of the presiding officer drew all eyes upon\nthe card, and then everybody shared the interest of Mr. Boon. In shape\nand size the card was not extraordinary, but it was composed of\nmetal. What metal? That question had immediately arisen in Mr. Boon's\nmind when the card came into his hand, and now it exercised the wits\nof all the others. Plainly it was not tin, brass, copper, bronze,\nsilver, aluminum--although its lightness might have suggested that\nmetal--nor even base gold.\n\nThe president, although a skilled metallurgist, confessed his\ninability to say what it was. So intent had he become in examining the\ncurious bit of metal that he forgot it was a visitor's card of\nintroduction, and did not even look for the name which it presumably\nbore.\n\nAs he held the card up to get a better light upon it a stray sunbeam\nfrom the window fell across the metal and instantly it bloomed with\nexquisite colors!  The president's chair being in the darker end of\nthe room, the radiant card suffused the atmosphere about him with a\nfaint rose tint, playing with surprising liveliness into alternate\ncanary color and violet.\n\nThe effect upon the company of clear-headed financiers was extremely\nremarkable. The unknown metal appeared to exercise a kind of mesmeric\ninfluence, its soft hues blending together in a chromatic harmony\nwhich captivated the sense of vision as the ears are charmed by a\nperfectly rendered song. Gradually all gathered in an eager group\naround the president's chair.\n\n\"What can it be?\" was repeated from lip to lip.\n\n\"Did you ever see anything like it?\" asked Mr. Boon for the twentieth\ntime.\n\nNone of them had ever seen the like of it. A spell fell upon the\nassemblage. For five minutes no one spoke, while Mr. Boon continued to\nchase the flickering sunbeam with the wonderful card. Suddenly the\nsilence was broken by a voice which had a touch of awe in it:\n\n\"It must be the metal!\"\n\nThe speaker was an English financier, First Lord of the Treasury,\nHon. James Hampton-Jones, K.C.B. Immediately everybody echoed his\nremark, and the strain being thus relieved, the spell dropped from\nthem and several laughed loudly over their momentary aberration.\n\nPresident Boon recollected himself, and, coloring slightly, placed the\ncard flat on the table, in order more clearly to see the name. In\nplain red letters it stood forth with such surprising distinctness\nthat Mr. Boon wondered why he had so long overlooked it.\n\n  \"DR. MAX SYX.\"\n\n\"Tell the gentleman to come in,\" said the president, and thereupon the\nattendant threw open the door.\n\nThe owner of the mysterious card fixed every eye as he entered. He was\nseveral inches more than six feet in height. His complexion was very\ndark, his eyes were intensely black, bright, and deep-set, his\neyebrows were bushy and up-curled at the ends, his sable hair was\nclose-trimmed, and his ears were narrow, pointed at the top, and\nprominent. He wore black mustaches, covering only half the width of\nhis lip and drawn into projecting needles on each side, while a spiked\nblack beard adorned the middle of his chin.\n\nHe smiled as he stepped confidently forward, with a courtly bow, but\nit was a very disconcerting smile, because it more than half resembled\na sneer. This uncommon person did not wait to be addressed.\n\n\"I have come to solve your problem,\" he said, facing President Boon,\nwho had swung round on his pivoted chair.\n\n\"The metal!\" exclaimed everybody in a breath, and with a unanimity and\nexcitement which would have astonished them if they had been\nspectators instead of actors of the scene. The tall stranger bowed and\nsmiled again:\n\n\"Just so,\" he said. \"What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"It is beautiful!\"\n\nAgain the reply came from every mouth simultaneously, and again if the\nspeakers could have been listeners they would have wondered not only\nat their earnestness, but at their words, for why should they\ninstantly and unanimously pronounce that beautiful which they had not\neven seen? But every man knew he had seen it, for instinctively their\nminds reverted to the card and recognized in it the metal referred\nto. The mesmeric spell seemed once more to fall upon the assemblage,\nfor the financiers noticed nothing remarkable in the next act of the\nstranger, which was to take a chair, uninvited, at the table, and the\nmoment he sat down he became the presiding officer as naturally as if\nhe had just been elected to that post. They all waited for him to\nspeak, and when he opened his mouth they listened with breathless\nattention.\n\nHis words were of the best English, but there was some peculiarity,\nwhich they had already noticed, either in his voice or his manner of\nenunciation, which struck all of the listeners as denoting a\nforeigner. But none of them could satisfactorily place him. Neither\nthe Americans, the Englishmen, the Germans, the Frenchmen, the\nRussians, the Austrians, the Italians, the Spaniards, the Turks, the\nJapanese, or the Chinese at the board could decide to what race or\nnationality the stranger belonged.\n\n\"This metal,\" he began, taking the card from Mr. Boon's hand, \"I have\ndiscovered and named. I call it 'artemisium.' I can produce it, in the\npure form, abundantly enough to replace gold, giving it the same\nrelative value that gold possessed when it was the universal\nstandard.\"\n\nAs Dr. Syx spoke he snapped the card with his thumb-nail and it\nfluttered with quivering hues like a humming-bird hovering over a\nflower. He seemed to await a reply, and President Boon asked:\n\n\"What guarantee can you give that the supply would be adequate and\ncontinuous?\"\n\n\"I will conduct a committee of this congress to my mine in the Rocky\nMountains, where, in anticipation of the event, I have accumulated\nenough refined artemisium to provide every civilized land with an\namount of coin equivalent to that which it formerly held in gold. I\ncan there satisfy you of my ability to maintain the production.\"\n\n\"But how do we know that this metal of yours will answer the purpose?\"\n\n\"Try it,\" was the laconic reply.\n\n\"There is another difficulty,\" pursued the president. \"People will not\naccept a new metal in place of gold unless they are convinced that it\npossesses equal intrinsic value. They must first become familiar with\nit, and it must be abundant enough and desirable enough to be used\nsparingly in the arts, just as gold was.\"\n\n\"I have provided for all that,\" said the stranger, with one of his\ndisconcerting smiles. \"I assure you that there will be no trouble with\nthe people. They will be only too eager to get and to use the\nmetal. Let me show you.\"\n\nHe stepped to the door and immediately returned with two black\nattendants bearing a large tray filled with articles shaped from the\nsame metal as that of which the card was composed. The financiers all\njumped to their feet with exclamations of surprise and admiration, and\ngathered around the tray, whose dazzling contents lighted up the\ncorner of the room where it had been placed as if the moon were\nshining there.\n\nThere were elegantly formed vases, adorned with artistic figures,\nembossed and incised, and glowing with delicate colors which shimmered\nin tiny waves with the slightest motion of the tray. Cups, pins,\nfinger-rings, earrings, watch-chains, combs, studs, lockets, medals,\ntableware, models of coins--in brief, almost every article in the\nfabrication of which precious metals have been employed was to be seen\nthere in profusion, and all composed of the strange new metal which\neverybody on the spot declared was far more splendid than gold.\n\n\"Do you think it will answer?\" asked Dr. Syx.\n\n\"We do,\" was the unanimous reply.\n\nAll then resumed their seats at the table, the tray with its\nmagnificent array having been placed in the centre of the board. This\ndisplay had a remarkable influence. Confidence awoke in the breasts of\nthe financiers. The dark clouds that had oppressed them rolled off,\nand the prospect grew decidedly brighter.\n\n\"What terms do you demand?\" at length asked Mr. Boon, cheerfully\nrubbing his hands.\n\n\"I must have military protection for my mine and reducing works,\"\nreplied Dr. Syx. \"Then I shall ask the return of one per cent, on the\ncirculating medium, together with the privilege of disposing of a\ncertain amount of the metal--to be limited by agreement--to the public\nfor use in the arts. Of the proceeds of this sale I will pay ten per\ncent. to the government in consideration of its protection.\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed President Boon, \"that will make you the richest man\nwho ever lived!\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Why,\" added Mr. Boon, opening his eyes wider as the facts continued\nto dawn upon him, \"you will become the financial dictator of the whole\nearth!\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" again responded Dr. Syx, unmoved. \"That is what I\npurpose to become. My discovery entitles me to no less. But, remember,\nI place myself under government inspection and restriction. I should\nnot be allowed to flood the market, even if I were disposed to do\nso. But my own interest would restrain me. It is to my advantage that\nartemisium, once adopted, shall remain stable in value.\"\n\nA shadow of doubt suddenly crossed the president's face.\n\n\"Suppose your secret is discovered,\" he said. \"Surely your mine will\nnot remain the only one. If you, in so short a time, have been able to\naccumulate an immense quantity of the new metal, it must be extremely\nabundant. Others will discover it, and then where shall we be?\"\n\nWhile Mr. Boon uttered these words, those who were watching Dr. Syx\n(as the president was not) resembled persons whose startled eyes are\nfixed upon a wild beast preparing to spring. As Mr. Boon ceased\nspeaking he turned towards the visitor, and instantly his lips fell\napart and his face paled.\n\nDr. Syx had drawn himself up to his full stature, and his features\nwere distorted with that peculiar mocking smile which had now returned\nwith a concentrated expression of mingled self-confidence and disdain.\n\n\"Will you have relief, or not?\" he asked in a dry, hard voice. \"What\ncan you do? I alone possess the secret which can restore industry and\ncommerce. If you reject my offer, do you think a second one will\ncome?\"\n\nPresident Boon found voice to reply, stammeringly:\n\n\"I did not mean to suggest a rejection of the offer. I only wished to\ninquire if you thought it probable that there would be no repetition\nof what occurred after gold was found at the south pole?\"\n\n\"The earth may be full of my metal,\" returned Dr. Syx, almost\nfiercely, \"but so long as I alone possess the knowledge how to extract\nit, is it of any more worth than common dirt? But come,\" he added,\nafter a pause and softening his manner, \"I have other schemes. Will\nyou, as representatives of the leading nations, undertake the\nintroduction of artemisium as a substitute for gold, or will you not?\"\n\n\"Can we not have time for deliberation?\" asked President Boon.\n\n\"Yes, one hour. Within that time I shall return to learn your\ndecision,\" replied Dr. Syx, rising and preparing to depart. \"I leave\nthese things,\" pointing to the tray, \"in your keeping, and,\"\nsignificantly, \"I trust your decision will be a wise one.\"\n\nHis curious smile again curved his lips and shot the ends of his\nmustache upward, and the influence of that smile remained in the room\nwhen he had closed the door behind him. The financiers gazed at one\nanother for several minutes in silence, then they turned towards the\ncoruscating metal that filled the tray.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE GRAND TETON MINE\n\nAway on the western border of Wyoming, in the all but inaccessible\nheart of the Rocky Mountains, three mighty brothers, \"The Big Tetons,\"\nlook perpendicularly into the blue eye of Jenny's Lake, lying at the\nbottom of the profound depression among the mountains called Jackson's\nHole.  Bracing against one another for support, these remarkable peaks\nlift their granite spires from 12,000 to nearly 14,000 feet into the\nblue dome that arches the crest of the continent. Their sides, and\nespecially those of their chief, the Grand Teton, are streaked with\nglaciers, which shine like silver trappings when the morning sun comes\nup above the wilderness of mountains stretching away eastward from the\nhole.\n\nWhen the first white men penetrated this wonderful region, and one of\nthem bestowed his wife's name upon Jenny's Lake, they were intimidated\nby the Grand Teton. It made their flesh creep, accustomed though they\nwere to rough scrambling among mountain gorges and on the brows of\nimmense precipices, when they glanced up the face of the peak, where\nthe cliffs fall, one below another, in a series of breathless\ndescents, and imagined themselves clinging for dear life to those\nskyey battlements.\n\nBut when, in 1872, Messrs. Stevenson and Langford finally reached the\ntop of the Grand Teton--the only successful members of a party of nine\npractised climbers who had started together from the bottom--they\nfound there a little rectangular enclosure, made by piling up rocks,\nsix or seven feet across and three feet in height, bearing evidences\nof great age, and indicating that the red Indians had, for some\nunknown purpose, resorted to the summit of this tremendous peak long\nbefore the white men invaded their mountains. Yet neither the Indians\nnor the whites ever really conquered the Teton, for above the highest\npoint that they attained rises a granite buttress, whose smooth\nvertical sides seemed to them to defy everything but wings.\n\nWinding across the sage-covered floor of Jackson's Hole runs the\nShoshone, or Snake River, which takes its rise from Jackson's Lake at\nthe northern end of the basin, and then, as if shrinking from the\nthreatening brows of the Tetons, whose fall would block its progress,\nmakes a detour of one hundred miles around the buttressed heights of\nthe range before it finds a clear way across Idaho, and so on to the\nColumbia River and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOn a July morning, about a month after the visit of Dr. Max Syx to the\nassembled financiers in New York, a party of twenty horsemen,\nfollowing a mountain-trail, arrived on the eastern margin of Jackson's\nHole, and pausing upon a commanding eminence, with exclamations of\nwonder, glanced across the great depression, where lay the shining\ncoils of the Snake River, at the towering forms of the Tetons, whose\nice-striped cliffs flashed lightnings in the sunshine. Even the\nimpassive broncos that the party rode lifted their heads inquiringly,\nand snorted as if in equine astonishment at the magnificent spectacle.\n\nOne familiar with the place would have noticed something, which, to\nhis mind, would have seemed more surprising than the pageantry of the\nmountains in their morning sun-bath. Curling above one of the wild\ngorges that cut the lower slopes of the Tetons was a thick black\nsmoke, which, when lifted by a passing breeze, obscured the precipices\nhalf-way to the summit of the peak.\n\nHad the Grand Teton become a volcano? Certainly no hunting or\nexploring party could make a smoke like that. But a word from the\nleader of the party of horsemen explained the mystery.\n\n\"There is my mill, and the mine is underneath it.\"\n\nThe speaker was Dr. Syx, and his companions were members of the\nfinancial congress. When he quitted their presence in New York, with\nthe promise to return within an hour for their reply, he had no doubt\nin his own mind what that reply would be. He knew they would accept\nhis proposition, and they did. No time was then lost in communicating\nwith the various governments, and arrangements were quickly perfected\nwhereby, in case the inspection of Dr. Syx's mine and its resources\nproved satisfactory, America and Europe should unite in adopting the\nnew metal as the basis of their coinage. As soon as this stage in the\nnegotiations was reached, it only remained to send a committee of\nfinanciers and metallurgists, in company with Dr. Syx, to the Rocky\nMountains. They started under the doctor's guidance, completing the\nlast stage of their journey on horseback.\n\n\"An inspection of the records at Washington,\" Dr. Syx continued,\naddressing the horsemen, \"will show that I have filed a claim covering\nten acres of ground around the mouth of my mine. This was done as soon\nas I had discovered the metal. The filing of the claim and the\nsubsequent proceedings which perfected my ownership attracted no\nattention, because everybody was thinking of the south pole and its\ngold-fields.\"\n\nThe party gathered closer around Dr. Syx and listened to his words\nwith silent attention, while their horses rubbed noses and jingled\ntheir gold-mounted trappings.\n\n\"As soon as I had legally protected myself,\" he continued, \"I employed\na force of men, transported my machinery and material across the\nmountains, erected my furnaces, and opened the mine. I was safe from\nintrusion, and even from idle curiosity, for the reason I have just\nmentioned. In fact, so exclusive was the attraction of the new\ngold-fields that I had difficulty in obtaining workmen, and finally I\nsent to Africa and engaged negroes, whom I placed in charge of\ntrustworthy foremen. Accordingly, with half a dozen exceptions, you\nwill see only black men at the mine.\"\n\n\"And with their aid you have mined enough metal to supply the mints of\nthe world?\" asked President Boon.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" was the reply. \"But I no longer employ the large force\nwhich I needed at first.\"\n\n\"How much metal have you on hand? I am aware that you have already\nanswered this question during our preliminary negotiations, but I ask\nit again for the benefit of some members of our party who were not\npresent then.\"\n\n\"I shall show you to-day,\" said Dr. Syx, with his curious smile, \"2500\ntons of refined artemisium, stacked in rock-cut vaults under the Grand\nTeton.\"\n\n\"And you have dared to collect such inconceivable wealth in one\nplace?\"\n\n\"You forget that it is not wealth until the people have learned to\nvalue it, and the governments have put their stamp upon it.\"\n\n\"True, but how did you arrive at the proper moment?\"\n\n\"Easily. I first ascertained that before the Antarctic discoveries the\nworld contained altogether about 16,000 tons of gold, valued at\n$450,000 per ton, or $7,200,000,000 worth all told. Now my metal\nweighs, bulk for bulk, one-quarter as much as gold. It might be\nreckoned at the same intrinsic value per ton, but I have considered it\npreferable to take advantage of the smaller weight of the new metal,\nwhich permits us to make coins of the same size as the old ones, but\nonly one-quarter as heavy, by giving to artemisium four times the\nvalue per ton that gold had. Thus only 4000 tons of the new metal are\nrequired to supply the place of the 16,000 tons of gold. The 2500 tons\nwhich I already have on hand are more than enough for coinage. The\nrest I can supply as fast as needed.\"\n\nThe party did not wait for further explanations. They were eager to\nsee the wonderful mine and the store of treasure. Spurs were applied,\nand they galloped down the steep trail, forded the Snake River, and,\nskirting the shore of Jenny's Lake, soon found themselves gazing up\nthe headlong slopes and dizzy parapets of the Grand Teton. Dr. Syx led\nthem by a steep ascent to the mouth of the canyon, above one of whose\nwalls stood his mill, and where the \"Champ! Champ!\" of a powerful\nengine saluted their ears.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE WEALTH OF THE WORLD\n\nAn electric light shot its penetrating rays into a gallery cut through\nvirgin rock and running straight towards the heart of the Teton. The\ncentre of the gallery was occupied by a narrow railway, on which a few\nflat cars, propelled by electric power, passed to and fro.\nBlack-skinned and silent workmen rode on the cars, both when they came\nladen with broken masses of rock from the farther end of the tunnel\nand when they returned empty.\n\nSuddenly, to an eye situated a little way within the gallery, appeared\nat the entrance the dark face of Dr. Syx, wearing its most\ndiscomposing smile, and a moment later the broader countenance of\nPresident Boon loomed in the electric glare beside the doctor's black\nframework of eyebrows and mustache. Behind them were grouped the other\nvisiting financiers.\n\n\"This tunnel,\" said Dr. Syx, \"leads to the mine head, where the\nore-bearing rock is blasted.\"\n\nAs he spoke a hollow roar issued from the depths of the mountain,\nfollowed in a short time by a gust of foul air.\n\n\"You probably will not care to go in there,\" said the doctor, \"and, in\nfact, it is very uncomfortable. But we shall follow the next car-load\nto the smelter, and you can witness the reduction of the ore.\"\n\nAccordingly when another car came rumbling out of the tunnel, with its\nload of cracked rock, they all accompanied it into an adjoining\napartment, where it was cast into a metallic shute, through which,\nthey were informed, it reached the furnace.\n\n\"While it is melting,\" explained Dr. Syx, \"certain elements, the\nnature of which I must beg to keep secret, are mixed with the ore,\ncausing chemical action which results in the extraction of the\nmetal. Now let me show you pure artemisium issuing from the furnace.\"\n\nHe led the visitors through two apartments into a third, one side of\nwhich was walled by the front of a furnace. From this projected two or\nthree small spouts, and iridescent streams of molten metal fell from\nthe spouts into earthen receptacles from which the blazing liquid was\nled, like flowing iron, into a system of molds, where it was allowed\nto cool and harden.\n\nThe financiers looked on wondering, and their astonishment grew when\nthey were conducted into the rock-cut store-rooms beneath, where they\nsaw metallic ingots glowing like gigantic opals in the light which Dr.\nSyx turned on. They were piled in rows along the walls as high as a\nman could reach. A very brief inspection sufficed to convince the\nvisitors that Dr. Syx was able to perform all that he promised.\nAlthough they had not penetrated the secret of his process of reducing\nthe ore, yet they had seen the metal flowing from the furnace, and the\npiles of ingots proved conclusively that he had uttered no vain boast\nwhen he said he could give the world a new coinage.\n\nBut President Boon, being himself a metallurgist, desired to inspect\nthe mysterious ore a little more closely. Possibly he was thinking\nthat if another mine was destined to be discovered he might as well be\nthe discoverer as anybody. Dr. Syx attempted no concealment, but his\nsmile became more than usually scornful as he stopped a laden car and\ninvited the visitors to help themselves.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that I have struck the only lode of this ore in\nthe Teton, or possibly in this part of the world, but I don't know for\ncertain. There may be plenty of it only waiting to be found. That,\nhowever, doesn't trouble me. The great point is that nobody except\nmyself knows how to extract the metal.\"\n\nMr. Boon closely examined the chunk of rock which he had taken from\nthe car. Then he pulled a lens from his pocket, with a deprecatory\nglance at Dr. Syx.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" said the latter, with a laugh, the first that\nthese gentlemen had ever heard from his lips, and it almost made them\nshudder; \"put it to every test, examine it with the microscope, with\nfire, with electricity, with the spectroscope--in every way you can\nthink of! I assure you it is worth your while!\"\n\nAgain Dr. Syx uttered his freezing laugh, passing into the familiar\nsmile, which had now become an undisguised mock.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Boon, taking his eye from the lens, \"I see no\nsign of any metal here!\"\n\n\"Look at the green specks!\" cried the doctor, snatching the specimen\nfrom the president's hand. \"That's it! That's artemisium! But it's of\nno use unless you can get it out and purify it, which is my secret!\"\n\nFor the third time Dr. Syx laughed, and his merriment affected the\nvisitors so disagreeably that they showed impatience to be\ngone. Immediately he changed his manner.\n\n\"Come into my office,\" he said, with a return to the graciousness\nwhich had characterized him ever since the party started from New\nYork.\n\nWhen they were all seated, and the doctor had handed round a box of\ncigars, he resumed the conversation in his most amiable manner.\n\n\"You see, gentlemen,\" he said, turning a piece of ore in his fingers,\n\"artemisium is like aluminum. It can only be obtained in the metallic\nform by a special process. While these greenish particles, which you\nmay perhaps mistake for chrysolite, or some similar unisilicate,\nreally contain the precious metal, they are not entirely composed of\nit. The process by which I separate out the metallic element while the\nore is passing through the furnace is, in truth, quite simple, and its\nvery simplicity guards my secret. Make your minds easy as to\nover-production. A man is as likely to jump over the moon as to find\nme out.\"\n\n\"But,\" he continued, again changing his manner, \"we have had\nbusiness enough for one day; now for a little recreation.\" While\nspeaking the doctor pressed a button on his desk, and the room, which\nwas illuminated by electric lamps--for there were no windows in the\nbuilding--suddenly became dark, except part of one wall, where a broad\narea of light appeared. Dr. Syx's voice had become very soothing when\nnext he spoke: \"I am fond of amusing myself with a peculiar form of\nthe magic-lantern, which I invented some years ago, and which I have\nnever exhibited except for the entertainment of my friends. The\npictures will appear upon the wall, the apparatus being concealed.\"\n\nHe had hardly ceased speaking when the illuminated space seemed to\nmelt away, leaving a great opening, through which the spectators\nlooked as if into another world on the opposite side of the wall. For\na minute or two they could not clearly discern what was presented;\nthen, gradually, the flitting scenes and figures became more distinct\nuntil the lifelikeness of the spectacle absorbed their whole\nattention.\n\nBefore them passed, in panoramic review, a sunny land, filled with\nbrilliant-hued vegetation, and dotted with villages and cities which\nwere bright with light-colored buildings. People appeared moving\nthrough the scenes, as in a cinematograph exhibition, but with\ninfinitely more semblance of reality. In fact, the pictures, blending\none into another, seemed to be life itself. Yet it was not an\nearth-like scene. The colors of the passing landscape were such as no\nman in the room had ever beheld; and the people, tall, round-limbed,\nwith florid complexion, golden hair, and brilliant eyes and lips, were\nindescribably beautiful and graceful in all their movements.\n\nFrom the land the view passed out to sea, and bright blue waves, edged\nwith creaming foam, ran swiftly under the spectator's eyes, and\noccasionally, driven before light winds, appeared fleets of daintily\nshaped vessels, which reminded the beholder, by their flashing wings,\nof the feigned \"ship of pearl.\"\n\nAfter the fairy ships and breezy sea views came a long, curving line\nof coast, brilliant with coral sands, and indented by frequent bays,\nalong whose enchanting shores lay pleasant towns, the landscapes\nbehind them splendid with groves, meadows, and streams.\n\nPresently the shifting photographic tape, or whatever the mechanism\nmay have been, appeared to have settled upon a chosen scene, and there\nit rested. A broad champaign reached away to distant sapphire\nmountains, while the foreground was occupied by a magnificent house,\nresembling a large country villa, fronted with a garden, shaded by\nbowers and festoons of huge, brilliant flowers. Birds of radiant\nplumage flitted among the trees and blossoms, and then appeared a\ncompany of gayly attired people, including many young girls, who\njoined hands and danced in a ring, apparently with shouts of laughter,\nwhile a group of musicians standing near thrummed and blew upon\ncuriously shaped instruments.\n\nSuddenly the shadow of a dense cloud flitted across the scene;\nwhereupon the brilliant birds flew away with screams of terror which\nalmost seemed to reach the ears of the onlookers through the wall. An\nexpression of horror came over the faces of the people. The children\nbroke from their merry circle and ran for protection to their\nelders. The utmost confusing and whelming terror were evidenced for a\nmoment--then the ground split asunder, and the house and the garden,\nwith all their living occupants were swallowed by an awful chasm which\nopened just where they had stood. The great rent ran in a widening\nline across the sunlit landscape until it reached the horizon, when\nthe distant mountains crumbled, clouds poured in from all sides at\nonce, and billows of flame burst through them as they veiled the\nscene.\n\nBut in another instant the commotion was over, and the world whose\ncurious spectacles had been enacted as if on the other side of a\nwindow, seemed to retreat swiftly into space, until at last, emerging\nfrom a fleecy cloud, it reappeared in the form of the full moon\nhanging in the sky, but larger than is its wont, with its dry\nocean-beds, its keen-spired peaks, its ragged mountain ranges, its\ngaping chasms, its immense crater rings, and Tycho, the chief of them\nall, shooting raylike streaks across the scarred face of the abandoned\nlunar globe.  The show was ended, and Dr. Syx, turning on only a\npartial illumination in the room, rose slowly to his feet, his tall\nform appearing strangely magnified in the gloom, and invited his\nbewildered guests to accompany him to his house, outside the mill,\nwhere he said dinner awaited them. As they emerged into daylight they\nacted like persons just aroused from an opiate dream.\n\n\n\nV\n\nWONDERS OF THE NEW METAL\n\nWithin a twelvemonth after the visit of President Boon and his fellow\nfinanciers to the mine in the Grand Teton a railway had been\nconstructed from Jackson's Hole, connecting with one of the Pacific\nlines, and the distribution of the new metal was begun. All of\nDr. Syx's terms had been accepted. United States troops occupied a\npermanent encampment on the upper waters of the Snake River, to afford\nprotection, and as the consignments of precious ingots were hurried\neast and west on guarded trains, the mints all over the world resumed\ntheir activity. Once more a common monetary standard prevailed, and\ncommerce revived as if touched by a magic wand.\n\nArtemisium quickly won its way in popular favor. Its matchless beauty\nalone was enough. Not only was it gladly accepted in the form of\nmoney, but its success was instantaneous in the arts. Dr. Syx and the\ninspectors representing the various nations found it difficult to\nlimit the output to the agreed upon amount. The demand was incessant.\n\nGoldsmiths and jewellers continually discovered new excellences in the\nwonderful metal. Its properties of translucence and refraction enabled\nskilful artists to perform marvels. By suitable management a chain of\nartemisium could be made to resemble a string of vari-colored gems,\neach separate link having a tint of its own, while, as the wearer\nmoved, delicate complementary colors chased one another, in rapid\nundulation, from end to end.\n\nA fresh charm was added by the new metal to the personal adornment of\nwomen, and an enhanced splendor to the pageants of society. Gold in\nits palmiest days had never enjoyed such a vogue. A crowded reception\nroom or a dinner party where artemisium abounded possessed an\nindescribable atmosphere of luxury and richness, refined in quality,\nyet captivating to every sense. Imaginative persons went so far as to\naver that the sight and presence of the metal exercised a strangely\nsoothing and dreamy power over the mind, like the influence of\nmoonlight streaming through the tree-tops on a still, balmy night.\n\nThe public curiosity in regard to the origin of artemisium was\nboundless. The various nations published official bulletins in which\nthe general facts--omitting, of course, such incidents as the singular\nexhibition seen by the visiting financiers on the wall of Dr. Syx's\noffice--were detailed to gratify the universal desire for information.\n\nPresident Boon not only submitted the specimens of ore-bearing rock\nwhich he had brought from the mine to careful analysis, but also\nappealed to several of the greatest living chemists and mineralogists\nto aid him; but they were all equally mystified. The green substance\ncontained in the ore, although differing slightly from ordinary\nchrysolite, answered all the known tests of that mineral. It was\nremembered, however, that Dr. Syx had said that they would be likely\nto mistake the substance for chrysolite, and the result of their\nexperiments justified his prediction. Evidently the doctor had gone a\nstone's-cast beyond the chemistry of the day, and, just as evidently,\nhe did not mean to reveal his discovery for the benefit of science,\nnor for the benefit of any pockets except his own.\n\nNotwithstanding the failure of the chemists to extract anything from\nDr. Syx's ore, the public at large never doubted that the secret would\nbe discovered in good time, and thousands of prospectors flocked to\nthe Teton Mountains in search of the ore. And without much difficulty\nthey found it. Evidently the doctor had been mistaken in thinking that\nhis mine might be the only one. The new miners hurried specimens of\nthe green-speckled rock to the chemical laboratories for\nexperimentation, and meanwhile began to lay up stores of the ore in\nanticipation of the time when the proper way to extract the metal\nshould be discovered.\n\nBut, alas! that time did not come. The fresh ore proved to be as\nrefractory as that which had been obtained from Dr. Syx. But in the\nmidst of the universal disappointment there came a new sensation.\n\nOne morning the newspapers glared with a despatch from Grand Teton\nstation announcing that the metal itself had been discovered by\nprospectors on the eastern slope of the main peak.\n\n\"It outcrops in many places,\" ran the despatch, \"and many small\nnuggets have been picked out of crevices in the rocks.\"\n\nThe excitement produced by this news was even greater than when gold\nwas discovered at the south pole. Again a mad rush was made for the\nTetons. The heights around Jackson's Hole and the shores of Jackson's\nand Jenny's lakes were quickly dotted with camps, and the military\nforce had to be doubled to keep off the curious, and occasionally\nmenacing, crowds which gathered in the vicinity and seemed bent on\nunearthing the great secret locked behind the windowless walls of the\nmill, where the column of black smoke and the roar of the engine\nserved as reminders of the incredible wealth which the sole possessor\nof that secret was rolling up.\n\nThis time no mistake had been made. It was a fact that the metal, in\nvirgin purity, had been discovered scattered in various places on the\nledges of the Grand Teton. In a little while thousands had obtained\nspecimens with their own hands. The quantity was distressingly small,\nconsidering the number and the eagerness of the seekers, but that it\nwas genuine artemisium not even Dr. Syx could have denied. He,\nhowever, made no attempt to deny it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, when questioned, \"I find that I have been deceived. At\nfirst I thought the metal existed only in the form of the green ore,\nbut of late I have come upon veins of pure artemisium in my mine. I am\nglad for your sakes, but sorry for my own. Still, it may turn out that\nthere is no great amount of free artemisium after all.\"\n\nWhile the doctor talked in this manner close observers detected a\nlurking sneer which his acquaintances had not noticed since artemisium\nwas first adopted as the money basis of the world.\n\nThe crowd that swarmed upon the mountain quickly exhausted all of the\nvisible supply of the metal. Sometimes they found it in a thin stratum\nat the bottom of crevices, where it could be detached in opalescent\nplates and leaves of the thickness of paper. These superficial\ndeposits evidently might have been formed from water holding the metal\nin solution. Occasionally, deep cracks contained nuggets and wiry\nmasses which looked as if they had run together when molten.\n\nThe most promising spots were soon staked out in miners' claims,\nmachinery was procured, stock companies were formed, and borings were\nbegun. The enthusiasm arising from the earlier finds and the\nflattering surface indications caused everybody to work with feverish\nhaste and energy, and within two months one hundred tunnels were\npiercing the mountain.\n\nFor a long time nobody was willing to admit the truth which gradually\nforced itself upon the attention of the miners. The deeper they went\nthe scarcer became the indications of artemisium! In fact, such\ndeposits as were found were confined to fissures near the surface. But\nDr. Syx continued to report a surprising increase in the amount of\nfree metal in his mine, and this encouraged all who had not exhausted\ntheir capital to push on their tunnels in the hope of finally striking\na vein. At length, however, the smaller operators gave up in despair,\nuntil only one heavily capitalized company remained at work.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nA STRANGE DISCOVERY\n\n\"It is my belief that Dr. Max Syx is a deceiver.\"\n\nThe person who uttered this opinion was a young engineer, Andrew Hall,\nwho had charge of the operations of one of the mining companies which\nwere driving tunnels into the Grand Teton.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked President Boon, who was the\nprincipal backer of the enterprise.\n\n\"I mean,\" replied Hall, \"that there is no free metal in this mountain,\nand Dr. Syx knows there is none.\"\n\n\"But he is getting it himself from his mine,\" retorted President Boon.\n\n\"So he says, but who has seen it? No one is admitted into the Syx\nmine, his foremen are forbidden to talk, and his workmen are specially\nimported negroes who do not understand the English language.\"\n\n\"But,\" persisted Mr. Boon, \"how, then, do you account for the nuggets\nscattered over the mountain? And, beside, what object could Dr. Syx\nhave in pretending that there is free metal to be had for the\ndigging?\"\n\n\"He may have salted the mountain, for all I know,\" said Hall. \"As for\nhis object, I confess I am entirely in the dark; but, for all that, I\nam convinced that we shall find no more metal if we dig ten miles for\nit.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the president; \"if we keep on we shall strike it. Did\nnot Dr. Syx himself admit that he found no free artemisium until his\ntunnel had reached the core of the peak? We must go as deep as he has\ngone before we give up.\"\n\n\"I fear the depths he attains are beyond most people's reach,\" was\nHall's answer, while a thoughtful look crossed his clear-cut brow,\n\"but since you desire it, of course the work shall go on. I should\nlike, however, to change the direction of the tunnel.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Boon; \"bore in whatever direction you think\nproper, only don't despair.\"\n\nAbout a month after this conversation Andrew Hall, with whom a\ncommunity of tastes in many things had made me intimately acquainted,\nasked me one morning to accompany him into his tunnel.\n\n\"I want to have a trusty friend at my elbow,\" he said, \"for, unless I\nam a dreamer, something remarkable will happen within the next hour,\nand two witnesses are better than one.\"\n\nI knew Hall was not the person to make such a remark carelessly, and\nmy curiosity was intensely excited, but, knowing his peculiarities, I\ndid not press him for an explanation. When we arrived at the head of\nthe tunnel I was surprised at finding no workmen there.\n\n\"I stopped blasting some time ago,\" said Hall, in explanation, \"for a\nreason which, I hope, will become evident to you very soon. Lately I\nhave been boring very slowly, and yesterday I paid off the men and\ndismissed them with the announcement, which, I am confident, President\nBoon will sanction after he hears my report of this morning's work,\nthat the tunnel is abandoned. You see, I am now using a drill which I\ncan manage without assistance. I believe the work is almost completed,\nand I want you to witness the end of it.\"\n\nHe then carefully applied the drill, which noiselessly screwed its\nnose into the rock. When it had sunk to a depth of a few inches he\nwithdrew it, and, taking a hand-drill capable of making a hole not\nmore than an eighth of an inch in diameter, cautiously began boring in\nthe centre of the larger cavity. He had made hardly a hundred turns of\nthe handle when the drill shot through the rock! A gratified smile\nilluminated his features, and he said in a suppressed voice:\n\n\"Don't be alarmed; I'm going to put out the light.\"\n\nInstantly we were in complete darkness, but being close at Hall's side\nI could detect his movements. He pulled out the drill, and for half a\nminute remained motionless as if listening. There was no sound.\n\n\"I must enlarge the opening,\" he whispered, and immediately the faint\ngrating of a sharp tool cutting through the rock informed me of his\nprogress.\n\n\"There,\" at last he said, \"I think that will do; now for a look.\"\n\nI could tell that he had placed his eye at the hole and was gazing\nwith breathless attention. Presently he pulled my sleeve.\n\n\"Put your eye here,\" he whispered, pushing me into the proper position\nfor looking through the hole.\n\nAt first I could discern nothing except a smoky blue glow. But soon my\nvision cleared a little, and then I perceived that I was gazing into a\nnarrow tunnel which met ours directly end to end. Glancing along the\naxis of this gallery I saw, some two hundred yards away, a faint light\nwhich evidently indicated the mouth of the tunnel.\n\nAt the end where we had met it the mysterious tunnel was considerably\nwidened at one side, as if the excavators had started to change\ndirection and then abandoned the work, and in this elbow I could just\nsee the outlines of two or three flat cars loaded with broken stone,\nwhile a heap of the same material lay near them. Through the centre of\nthe tunnel ran a railway track.\n\n\"Do you know what you are looking at?\" asked Hall in my ear.\n\n\"I begin to suspect,\" I replied, \"that you have accidentally run into\nDr. Syx's mine.\"\n\n\"If Dr. Syx had been on his guard this accident wouldn't have\nhappened,\" replied Hall, with an almost inaudible chuckle.\n\n\"I heard you remark a month ago,\" I said, \"that you were changing the\ndirection of your tunnel. Has this been the aim of your labors ever\nsince?\"\n\n\"You have hit it,\" he replied. \"Long ago I became convinced that my\ncompany was throwing away its money in a vain attempt to strike a lode\nof pure artemisium. But President Boon has great faith in Dr. Syx, and\nwould not give up the work. So I adopted what I regarded as the only\npracticable method of proving the truth of my opinion and saving the\ncompany's funds. An electric indicator, of my invention, enabled me to\nlocate the Syx tunnel when I got near it, and I have met it end on,\nand opened this peep-hole in order to observe the doctor's\noperations. I feel that such spying is entirely justified in the\ncircumstances. Although I cannot yet explain just how or why I feel\nsure that Dr. Syx was the cause of the sudden discovery of the surface\nnuggets, and that he has encouraged the miners for his own ends, until\nhe has brought ruin to thousands who have spent their last cent in\ndriving useless tunnels into this mountain. It is a righteous thing to\nexpose him.\"\n\n\"But,\" I interposed, \"I do not see that you have exposed anything yet\nexcept the interior of a tunnel.\"\n\n\"You will see more clearly after a while,\" was the reply.\n\nHall now placed his eye again at the aperture, and was unable entirely\nto repress the exclamation that rose to his lips. He remained staring\nthrough the hole for several minutes without uttering a\nword. Presently I noticed that the lenses of his eye were illuminated\nby a ray of light coming through the hole, but he did not stir.\n\nAfter a long inspection he suddenly applied his ear to the hole and\nlistened intently for at least five minutes. Not a sound was audible\nto me, but, by an occasional pressure of the hand, Hall signified that\nsome important disclosure was reaching his sense of hearing. At length\nhe removed his ear.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" he whispered, \"for keeping you so long in waiting, but\nwhat I have just seen and overheard was of a nature to admit of no\ninterruption. He is still talking, and by pressing your ear against\nthe hole you may be able to catch what he says.\"\n\n\"Who is 'he'?\"\n\n\"Look for yourself.\"\n\nI placed my eye at the aperture, and almost recoiled with the violence\nof my surprise. The tunnel before me was brilliantly illuminated, and\nwithin three feet of the wall of rock behind which we crouched stood\nDr. Syx, his dark profile looking almost satanic in the sharp contrast\nof light and shadow. He was talking to one of his foremen, and the two\nwere the only visible occupants of the tunnel. Putting my ear to the\nlittle opening, I heard his words distinctly:\n\n--\"end of their rope. Well, they've spent a pretty lot of money for\ntheir experience, and I rather think we shall not be troubled again by\nartemisium-seekers for some time to come.\"\n\nThe doctor's voice ceased, and instantly I clapped my eye to the\nhole. He had changed his position so that his black eyes now looked\nstraight at the aperture. My heart was in my mouth, for at first I\nbelieved from his expression that he had detected the gleam of my\neyeball. But if so, he probably mistook it for a bit of mica in the\nrock, and paid no further attention. Then his lips moved, and I put my\near again to the hole. He seemed to be replying to a question that the\nforeman had asked.\n\n\"If they do,\" he said, \"they will never guess the real secret.\"\n\nThereupon he turned on his heel, kicked a bit of rock off the track,\nand strode away towards the entrance. The foreman paused long enough\nto turn out the electric lamp, and then followed the doctor.\n\n\"Well,\" asked Hall, \"what have you heard?\"\n\nI told him everything.\n\n\"It fully corroborates the evidence of my own eyes and ears,\" he\nremarked, \"and we may count ourselves extremely lucky. It is not\nlikely that Dr. Syx will be heard a second time proclaiming his\ndeception with his own lips. It is plain that he was led to talk as he\ndid to the foreman on account of the latter's having informed him of\nthe sudden discharge of my men this morning. Their presence within\near-shot of our hiding-place during their conversation was, of course,\npure accident, and so you can see how kind fortune has been to us. I\nexpected to have to watch and listen and form deductions for a week,\nat least, before getting the information which five lucky minutes have\nplaced in our hands.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking my companion busied himself in carefully\nplugging up the hole in the rock. When it was closed to his\nsatisfaction he turned on the light in our tunnel.\n\n\"Did you observe,\" he asked, \"that there was a second tunnel?\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"When the light was on in there I saw the mouth of a smaller tunnel\nentering the main one behind the cars on the right. Did you notice\nit?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" I replied. \"I did observe some kind of a dark hole there,\nbut I paid no attention to it because I was so absorbed in the\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"Well,\" rejoined Hall, smiling, \"it was worth considerably more than a\nglance. As a subject of thought I find it even more absorbing than\nDr. Syx. Did you see the track in it?\"\n\n\"No,\" I had to acknowledge, \"I did not notice that. But,\" I continued,\na little piqued by his manner, \"being a branch of the main tunnel, I\ndon't see anything remarkable in its having a track also.\"\n\n\"It was rather dim in that hole,\" said Hall, still smiling in a\nsomewhat provoking way, \"but the railroad track was there plain\nenough. And, whether you think it remarkable or not, I should like to\nlay you a wager that that track leads to a secret worth a dozen of the\none we have just overheard.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" I retorted, still smarting a little, \"I shall not\npresume to match my stupidity against your perspicacity. I haven't\ncat's eyes in the dark.\"\n\nHall immediately broke out laughing, and, slapping me good-naturedly\non the shoulder, exclaimed:\n\n\"Come, come now! If you go to kicking back at a fellow like that, I\nshall be sorry I ever undertook this adventure.\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\nA MYSTERY INDEED!\n\nWhen President Boon had heard our story he promptly approved Hall's\ndismissal of the men. He expressed great surprise that Dr. Syx should\nhave resorted to a deception which had been so disastrous to innocent\npeople, and at first he talked of legal proceedings. But, after\nthinking the matter over, he concluded that Syx was too powerful to be\nattacked with success, especially when the only evidence against him\nwas that he had claimed to find artemisium in his mine at a time when,\nas everybody knew, artemisium actually was found outside the\nmine. There was no apparent motive for the deception, and no proof of\nmalicious intent. In short, Mr. Boon decided that the best thing for\nhim and his stockholders to do was to keep silent about their losses\nand await events. And, at Hall's suggestion, he also determined to say\nnothing to anybody about the discovery we had made.\n\n\"It could do no good,\" said Hall, in making the suggestion, \"and it\nmight spoil a plan I have in mind.\"\n\n\"What plan?\" asked the president.\n\n\"I prefer not to tell just yet,\" was the reply.\n\nI observed that, in our interview with Mr. Boon, Hall made no\nreference to the side tunnel to which he had appeared to attach so\nmuch importance, and I concluded that he now regarded it as lacking\nsignificance. In this I was mistaken.\n\nA few days afterwards I received an invitation from Hall to accompany\nhim once more into the abandoned tunnel.\n\n\"I have found out what that sidetrack means,\" he said, \"and it has\nplunged me into another mystery so dark and profound that I cannot see\nmy way through it. I must beg you to say no word to any one concerning\nthe things I am about to show you.\"\n\nI gave the required promise, and we entered the tunnel, which nobody\nhad visited since our former adventure. Having extinguished our lamp,\nmy companion opened the peep-hole, and a thin ray of light streamed\nthrough from the tunnel on the opposite side of the wall. He applied\nhis eye to the hole.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, quickly stepping back and pushing me into his place,\n\"they are still at it. Look, and tell me what you see.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I replied, after placing my eye at the aperture, \"a gang of\nmen unloading a car which has just come out of the side tunnel, and\nputting its contents upon another car standing on the track of the\nmain tunnel.\"\n\n\"Yes, and what are they handling?\"\n\n\"Why, ore, of course.\"\n\n\"And do you see nothing significant in that?\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, that ore--\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" admonished Hall, putting his hand over my mouth; \"don't\ntalk so loud. Now go on, in a whisper.\"\n\n\"The ore,\" I resumed, \"may have come back from the furnace-room,\nbecause the side tunnel turns off so as to run parallel with the\nother.\"\n\n\"It not only may have come back, it actually has come back,\" said\nHall.\n\n\"How can you be sure?\"\n\n\"Because I have been over the track, and know that it leads to a\nsecret apartment directly under the furnace in which Dr. Syx pretends\nto melt the ore!\"\n\nFor a minute after hearing this avowal I was speechless.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" I asked at length.\n\n\"Perfectly serious. Run your finger along the rock here. Do you\nperceive a seam? Two days ago, after seeing what you have just\nwitnessed in the Syx tunnel, I carefully cut out a section of the\nwall, making an aperture large enough to crawl through, and, when I\nknew the workmen were asleep, I crept in there and examined both\ntunnels from end to end. But in solving one mystery I have run myself\ninto another infinitely more perplexing.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Why does Dr. Syx take such elaborate pains to deceive his visitors,\nand also the government officers? It is now plain that he conducts no\nmining operations whatever. This mine of his is a gigantic\nblind. Whenever inspectors or scientific curiosity seekers visit his\nmill his mute workmen assume the air of being very busy, the cars\nladen with his so-called 'ore' rumble out of the tunnel, and their\ncontents are ostentatiously poured into the furnace, or appear to be\npoured into it, really dropping into a receptacle beneath, to be\ncarried back into the mine again. And then the doctor leads his gulled\nvisitors around to the other side of the furnace and shows them the\nmolten metal coming out in streams. Now what does it all mean? That's\nwhat I'd like to find out. What's his game? For, mark you, if he\ndoesn't get artemisium from this pretended ore, he gets it from some\nother source, and right on this spot, too. There is no doubt about\nthat. The whole world is supplied by Syx's furnace, and Syx feeds his\nfurnace with something that comes from his ten acres of Grand Teton\nrock. What is that something? How does he get it, and where does he\nhide it? These are the things I should like to find out.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"I fear I can't help you.\"\n\n\"But the difference between you and me,\" he retorted, \"is that you can\ngo to sleep over it, while I shall never get another good night's rest\nso long as this black mystery remains unsolved.\"\n\n\"What will you do?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly what. But I've got a dim idea which may take\nshape after a while.\"\n\nHall was silent for some time; then he suddenly asked:\n\n\"Did you ever hear of that queer magic-lantern show with which Dr. Syx\nentertained Mr. Boon and the members of the financial commission in\nthe early days of the artemisium business?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've heard the story, but I don't think it was ever made\npublic. The newspapers never got hold of it.\"\n\n\"No, I believe not. Odd thing, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, very odd, but just like the doctor's eccentric ways,\nthough. He's always doing something to astonish somebody, without any\napparent earthly reason. But what put you in mind of that?\"\n\n\"Free artemisium put me in mind of it,\" replied Hall, quizzically.\n\n\"I don't see the connection.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that I do either, but when you are dealing with Dr. Syx\nnothing is too improbable to be thought of.\"\n\nHall thereupon fell to musing again, while we returned to the entrance\nof the tunnel. After he had made everything secure, and slipped the\nkey into his pocket, my companion remarked:\n\n\"Don't you think it would be best to keep this latest discovery to\nourselves?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Because,\" he continued, \"nobody would be benefited just now by\nknowing what we know, and to expose the worthlessness of the 'ore'\nmight cause a panic. The public is a queer animal, and never gets\nscared at just the thing you expect will alarm it, but always at\nsomething else.\"\n\nWe had shaken hands and were separating when Hall stopped me.\n\n\"Do you believe in alchemy?\" he asked.\n\n\"That's an odd question from you,\" I replied. \"I thought alchemy was\nexploded long ago.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, slowly, \"I suppose it has been exploded, but then,\nyou know, an explosion may sometimes be a kind of instantaneous\neducation, breaking up old things but revealing new ones.\"\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nMORE OF DR. SYX'S MAGIC\n\nImportant business called me East soon after the meeting with Hall\ndescribed in the foregoing chapter, and before I again saw the Grand\nTeton very stirring events had taken place.\n\nAs the reader is aware, Dr. Syx's agreement with the various\ngovernments limited the output of his mine. An international\ncommission, continually in session in New York, adjusted the\ndifferences arising among the nations concerning financial affairs,\nand allotted to each the proper amount of artemisium for coinage. Of\ncourse, this amount varied from time to time, but a fair average could\neasily be maintained. The gradual increase of wealth, in houses,\nmachinery, manufactured and artistic products called for a\ncorresponding increase in the circulating medium; but this, too, was\neasily provided for. An equally painstaking supervision was exercised\nover the amount of the precious metal which Dr. Syx was permitted to\nsupply to the markets for use in the arts. On this side, also, the\ndemand gradually increased; but the wonderful Teton mine seemed equal\nto all calls upon its resources.\n\nAfter the failure of the mining operations there was a moderate\nrevival of the efforts to reduce the Teton ore, but no success cheered\nthe experimenters. Prospectors also wandered all over the earth\nlooking for pure artemisium, but in vain. The general public, knowing\nnothing of what Hall had discovered, and still believing Syx's story\nthat he also had found pure artemisium in his mine, accounted for the\nfailure of the tunnelling operations on the supposition that the\nmetal, in a free state, was excessively rare, and that Dr. Syx had had\nthe luck to strike the only vein of it that the Grand Teton\ncontained. As if to give countenance to this opinion, Dr. Syx now\nannounced, in the most public manner, that he had been deceived again,\nand that the vein of free metal he had struck being exhausted, no\nother had appeared. Accordingly, he said, he must henceforth rely\nexclusively, as in the beginning, upon reduction of the ore.\n\nArtemisium had proved itself an immense boon to mankind, and the new\nera of commercial prosperity which it had ushered in already exceeded\neverything that the world had known in the past. School-children\nlearned that human civilization had taken five great strides, known\nrespectively, beginning at the bottom, as the \"age of stone,\" the \"age\nof bronze,\" the \"age of iron,\" the \"age of gold,\" and the \"age of\nartemisium.\"\n\nNevertheless, sources of dissatisfaction finally began to appear, and,\nafter the nature of such things, they developed with marvellous\nrapidity. People began to grumble about \"contraction of the currency.\"\nIn every country there arose a party which demanded \"free money.\"\nDemagogues pointed to the brief reign of paper money after the\ndemonetization of gold as a happy period, when the people had enjoyed\ntheir rights, and the \"money barons\"--borrowing a term from\nnineteenth-century history--were kept at bay.\n\nThen came denunciations of the international commission for\nrestricting the coinage. Dr. Syx was described as \"a devil-fish\nsucking the veins of the planet and holding it helpless in the grasp\nof his tentacular billions.\" In the United States meetings of\nagitators passed furious resolutions, denouncing the government,\nassailing the rich, cursing Dr. Syx, and calling upon \"the oppressed\"\nto rise and \"take their own.\" The final outcome was, of course,\nviolence. Mobs had to be suppressed by military force. But the most\ndramatic scene in the tragedy occurred at the Grand Teton. Excited by\ninflammatory speeches and printed documents, several thousand armed\nmen assembled in the neighborhood of Jenny's Lake and prepared to\nattack the Syx mine. For some reason the military guard had been\ndepleted, and the mob, under the leadership of a man named Bings, who\nshowed no little talent as a commander and strategist, surprised the\nsmall force of soldiers and locked them up in their own guard-house.\n\nTelegraphic communication having been cut off by the astute Bings, a\nfierce attack was made on the mine. The assailants swarmed up the\nsides of the canyon, and attempted to break in through the foundation\nof the buildings. But the masonry was stronger than they had\nanticipated, and the attack failed. Sharp-shooters then climbed the\nneighboring heights, and kept up an incessant peppering of the walls\nwith conical bullets driven at four thousand feet per second.\n\nNo reply came from the gloomy structure. The huge column of black\nsmoke rose uninterruptedly into the sky, and the noise of the great\nengine never ceased for an instant. The mob gathered closer on all\nsides and redoubled the fire of the rifles, to which was now added the\nbelching of several machine-guns. Ragged holes began to appear in the\nwalls, and at the sight of these the assailants yelled with\ndelight. It was evident that, the mill could not long withstand so\ndestructive a bombardment. If the besiegers had possessed artillery\nthey would have knocked the buildings into splinters within twenty\nminutes. As it was, they would need a whole day to win their victory.\n\nSuddenly it became evident that the besieged were about to take a hand\nin the fight. Thus far they had not shown themselves or fired a shot,\nbut now a movement was perceived on the roof, and the projecting arms\nof some kind of machinery became visible. Many marksmen concentrated\ntheir fire upon the mysterious objects, but apparently with little\neffect. Bings, mounted on a rock, so as to command a clear view of the\nfield, was on the point, of ordering a party to rush forward with axes\nand beat down the formidable doors, when there came a blinding flash\nfrom the roof, something swished through the air, and a gust of heat\nmet the assailants in the face. Bings dropped dead from his perch, and\nthen, as if the scythe of the Destroyer had swung downward, and to\nright and left in quick succession, the close-packed mob was levelled,\nrank after rank, until the few survivors crept behind rocks for\nrefuge.\n\nInstantly the atmospheric broom swept up and down the canyon and\nacross the mountain's flanks, and the marksmen fell in bunches like\nshaken grapes. Nine-tenths of the besiegers were destroyed within ten\nminutes after the first movement had been noticed on the roof. Those\nwho survived owed their escape to the rocks which concealed them, and\nthey lost no time in crawling off into neighboring chasms, and, as\nsoon as they were beyond eye-shot from the mill, they fled with panic\nspeed.\n\nThen the towering form of Dr. Syx appeared at the door. Emerging\nwithout sign of fear or excitement, he picked his way among his fallen\nenemies, and, approaching the military guard-house, undid the\nfastening and set the imprisoned soldiers free.\n\n\"I think I am paying rather dear for my whistle,\" he said, with a\ncharacteristic sneer, to Captain Carter, the commander of the\ntroop. \"It seems that I must not only defend my own people and\nproperty when attacked by mob force, but must also come to the rescue\nof the soldiers whose pay-rolls are met from my pocket.\"\n\nThe captain made no reply, and Dr. Syx strode back to the works. When\nthe released soldiers saw what had occurred their amazement had no\nbounds. It was necessary at once to dispose of the dead, and this was\nno easy undertaking for their small force. However, they accomplished\nit, and at the beginning of their work made a most surprising\ndiscovery.\n\n\"How's this, Jim?\" said one of the men to his comrade, as they stooped\nto lift the nearest victim of Dr. Syx's withering fire. \"What's this\nfellow got all over him?\"\n\n\"Artemisium! 'pon my soul!\" responded \"Jim,\" staring at the\nbody. \"He's all coated over with it.\"\n\nImmediately from all sides came similar exclamations. Every man who\nhad fallen was covered with a film of the precious metal, as if he had\nbeen dipped into an electrolytic bath. Clothing seemed to have been\ncharred, and the metallic atoms had penetrated the flesh of the\nvictims. The rocks all round the battle-field were similarly\nveneered. \"It looks to me,\" said Captain Carter, \"as if old Syx had\nturned one of his spouts of artemisium into a hose-pipe and soaked 'em\nwith it.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" chimed in a lieutenant, \"that's exactly what he's done.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned the captain, \"if he can do that, I don't see what use\nhe's got for us here.\"\n\n\"Probably he don't want to waste the stuff,\" said the\nlieutenant. \"What do you suppose it cost him to plate this crowd?\"\n\n\"I guess a month's pay for the whole troop wouldn't cover the\nexpense. It's costly, but then--gracious! Wouldn't I have given\nsomething for the doctor's hose when I was a youngster campaigning in\nthe Philippines in '99?\"\n\nThe story of the marvellous way in which Dr. Syx defended his mill\nbecame the sensation of the world for many days. The hose-pipe theory,\nstruck off on the spot by Captain Carter, seized the popular fancy,\nand was generally accepted without further question. There was an\nelement of the ludicrous which robbed the tragedy of some of its\nhorror. Moreover, no one could deny that Dr. Syx was well within his\nrights in defending himself by any means when so savagely attacked,\nand his triumphant success, no less than the ingenuity which was\nsupposed to underlie it, placed him in an heroic light which he had\nnot hitherto enjoyed.\n\nAs to the demagogues who were responsible for the outbreak and its\nterrible consequences, they slunk out of the public eye, and the\nresult of the battle at the mine seemed to have been a clearing up of\nthe atmosphere, such as a thunderstorm effects at the close of a\nseason of foul weather.\n\nBut now, little as men guessed it, the beginning of the end was close\nat hand.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE DETECTIVE OF SCIENCE\n\nThe morning of my arrival at Grand Teton station, on my return from\nthe East, Andrew Hall met me with a warm greeting.\n\n\"I have been anxiously expecting you,\" he said, \"for I have made some\nprogress towards solving the great mystery. I have not yet reached a\nconclusion, but I hope soon to let you into the entire secret. In the\nmeantime you can aid me with your companionship, if in no other way,\nfor, since the defeat of the mob, this place has been mighty\nlonesome. The Grand Teton is a spot that people who have no particular\nbusiness out here carefully avoid. I am on speaking terms with\nDr. Syx, and occasionally, when there is a party to be shown around, I\nvisit his works, and make the best possible use of my eyes. Captain\nCarter of the military is a capital fellow, and I like to hear his\nstories of the war in Luzon forty years ago, but I want somebody to\nwhom I can occasionally confide things, and so you are as welcome as\nmoonlight in harvest-time.\"\n\n\"Tell me something about that wonderful fight with the mob. Did you\nsee it?\"\n\n\"I did. I had got wind of what Bings intended to do while I was down\nat Pocotello, and I hurried up here to warn the soldiers, but\nunfortunately I came too late. Finding the military cooped up in the\nguard-house and the mob masters of the situation, I kept out of sight\non the side of the Teton, and watched the siege with my binocular. I\nthink there was very little of the spectacle that I missed.\"\n\n\"What of the mysterious force that the doctor employed to sweep off\nthe assailants?\"\n\n\"Of course, Captain Carter's suggestion that Syx turned molten\nartemisium from his furnace into a hose-pipe and sprayed the enemy\nwith it is ridiculous. But it is much easier to dismiss Carter's\ntheory than to substitute a better one. I saw the doctor on the roof\nwith a gang of black workmen, and I noticed the flash of polished\nmetal turned rapidly this way and that, but there was some intervening\nobstacle which prevented me from getting a good view of the mechanism\nemployed. It certainly bore no resemblance to a hose-pipe, or anything\nof that kind. No emanation was visible from the machine, but it was\nstupefying to see the mob melt down.\"\n\n\"How about the coating of the bodies with artemisium?\"\n\n\"There you are back on the hose-pipe again,\" laughed Hall. \"But, to\ntell you the truth, I'd rather be excused from expressing an opinion\non that operation in wholesale electro-plating just at present. I've\nthe ghost of an idea what it means, but let me test my theory a little\nbefore I formulate it. In the meanwhile, won't you take a stroll with\nme?\"\n\n\"Certainly; nothing could please me better,\" I replied. \"Which way\nshall we go?\"\n\n\"To the top of the Grand Teton.\"\n\n\"What! are you seized with the mountain-climbing fever?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, but I have a particular reason for wishing to take a\nlook from that pinnacle.\"\n\n\"I suppose you know the real apex of the peak has never been trodden\nby man?\"\n\n\"I do know it, but it is just that apex that I am determined to have\nunder my feet for ten minutes. The failure of others is no argument\nfor us.\"\n\n\"Just as you say,\" I rejoined. \"But I suppose there is no indiscretion\nin asking whether this little climb has any relation to the mystery?\"\n\n\"If it didn't have an important relation to the clearing up of that\ndark thing I wouldn't risk my neck in such an undertaking,\" was the\nreply.\n\nAccordingly, the next morning we set out for the peak. All previous\nclimbers, as we were aware, had attacked it from the west. That seemed\nthe obvious thing to do, because the westward slopes of the mountain,\nwhile very steep, are less abrupt than those which face the rising\nsun. In fact, the eastern side of the Grand Teton appears to be\nabsolutely unclimbable. But both Hall and I had had experience with\nrock climbing in the Alps and the Dolomites, and we knew that what\nlooked like the hardest places sometimes turn out to be next to the\neasiest. Accordingly we decided--the more particularly because it\nwould save time, but also because we yielded to the common desire to\noutdo our predecessors--to try to scale the giant right up his face.\n\nWe carried a very light but exceedingly strong rope, about five\nhundred feet long, wore nail-shod shoes, and had each a metal-pointed\nstaff and a small hatchet in lieu of the regular mountaineer's\naxe. Advancing at first along the broken ridge between two gorges we\ngradually approached the steeper part of the Teton, where the cliffs\nlooked so sheer and smooth that it seemed no wonder that nobody had\never tried to scale them. The air was deliciously clear and the sky\nwonderfully blue above the mountains, and the moon, a few days past\nits last quarter, was visible in the southwest, its pale crescent face\nslightly blued by the atmosphere, as it always appears when seen in\ndaylight.\n\n  \"Slow westering, a phantom sail--\n   The lonely soul of yesterday.\"\n\nBehind us, somewhat north of east, lay the Syx works, with their black\nsmoke rising almost vertically in the still air. Suddenly, as we\nstumbled along on the rough surface, something whizzed past my face\nand fell on the rock at my feet. I looked at the strange missile, that\nhad come like a meteor out of open space, with astonishment.\n\nIt was a bird, a beautiful specimen of the scarlet tanagers, which I\nremembered the early explorers had found inhabiting the Teton canyons,\ntheir brilliant plumage borrowing splendor from contrast with the\ngloomy surroundings. It lay motionless, its outstretched wings having\na curious shrivelled aspect, while the flaming color of the breast was\nhalf obliterated with smutty patches. Stooping to pick it up, I\nnoticed a slight bronzing, which instantly recalled to my mind the\npeculiar appearance of the victims of the attack on the mine.\n\n\"Look here!\" I called to Hall, who was several yards in advance. He\nturned, and I held up the bird by a wing.\n\n\"Where did you get that?\" he asked.\n\n\"It fell at my feet a moment ago.\"\n\nHall glanced in a startled manner at the sky, and then down the slope\nof the mountain.\n\n\"Did you notice in what direction it was flying?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, it dropped so close that it almost grazed my nose. I saw nothing\nof it until it made me blink.\"\n\n\"I have been heedless,\" muttered Hall under his breath. At the time I\ndid not notice the singularity of his remark, my attention being\nabsorbed in contemplating the unfortunate tanager.\n\n\"Look how its feathers are scorched,\" I said.\n\n\"I know it,\" Hall replied, without glancing at the bird.\n\n\"And it is covered with a film of artemisium,\" I added, a little\npiqued by his abstraction.\n\n\"I know that, too.\"\n\n\"See here, Hall,\" I exclaimed, \"are you trying to make game of me?\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear fellow,\" he replied, dropping his\ncogitation. \"Pray forgive me. But this is no new phenomenon to me. I\nhave picked up birds in that condition on this mountain before. There\nis a terrible mystery here, but I am slowly letting light into it, and\nif we succeed in reaching the top of the peak I have good hope that\nthe illumination will increase.\"\n\n\"Here now,\" he added a moment later, sitting down upon a rock and\nthrusting the blade of his penknife into a crevice, \"what do you think\nof this?\"\n\nHe held up a little nugget of pure artemisium, and then went on:\n\n\"You know that all this slope was swept as clean as a Dutch\nhousewife's kitchen floor by the thousands of miners and prospectors\nwho swarmed over it a year or two ago, and do you suppose they would\nhave missed such a tidbit if it had been here then?\"\n\n\"Dr. Syx must have been salting the mountain again,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Hall, with a significant smile, \"if the doctor hasn't\nsalted it somebody else has, that's plain enough. But perhaps you\nwould like to know precisely what I expect to find out when we get on\nthe topknot of the Teton.\"\n\n\"I should certainly be delighted to learn the object of our journey,\"\nI said. \"Of course, I'm only going along for company and for the fun\nof the thing; but you know you can count on me for substantial aid\nwhenever you need it.\"\n\n\"It is because you are so willing to let me keep my own counsel,\" he\nrejoined, \"and to wait for things to ripen before compelling me to\ndisclose them, that I like to have you with me at critical times. Now,\nas to the object of this break-neck expedition, whose risks you\nunderstand as fully as I do, I need not assure you that it is of\nsupreme importance to the success of my plans. In a word, I hope to be\nable to look down into a part of Dr. Syx's mill which, if I am not\nmistaken, no human eye except his and those of his most trustworthy\nhelpers has ever been permitted to see. And if I see there what I\nfully expect to see, I shall have got a long step nearer to a great\nfortune.\"\n\n\"Good!\" I cried. \"_En avant_, then! We are losing time.\"\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE TOP OF THE GRAND TETON\n\nThe climbing soon became difficult, until at length we were going up\nhand over hand, taking advantage of crevices and knobs which an\ninexperienced eye would have regarded as incapable of affording a grip\nfor the fingers or a support for the toes. Presently we arrived at the\nfoot of a stupendous precipice, which was absolutely insurmountable by\nany ordinary method of ascent. Parts of it overhung, and everywhere\nthe face of the rock was too free from irregularities to afford any\nfooting, except to a fly.\n\n\"Now, to borrow the expression of old Bunyan, we are hard put to it,\"\nI remarked. \"If you will go to the left I will take the right and see\nif there is any chance of getting up.\"\n\n\"I don't believe we could find any place easier than this,\" Hall\nreplied, \"and so up we go where we are.\"\n\n\"Have you a pair of wings concealed about you?\" I asked, laughing at\nhis folly.\n\n\"Well, something nearly as good,\" he responded, unstrapping his\nknapsack. He produced a silken bag, which he unfolded on the rock.\n\n\"A balloon!\" I exclaimed. \"But how are you going to inflate it?\"\n\nFor reply Hall showed me a receptacle which, he said, contained liquid\nhydrogen, and which was furnished with a device for retarding the\nvolatilization of the liquid so that it could be carried with little\nloss.\n\n\"You remember I have a small laboratory in the abandoned mine,\" he\nexplained, \"where we used to manufacture liquid air for blasting. This\nballoon I made for our present purpose. It will just suffice to carry\nup our rope, and a small but practically unbreakable grapple of\nhardened gold. I calculate to send the grapple to the top of the\nprecipice with the balloon, and when it has obtained a firm hold in\nthe riven rock there we can ascend, sailor fashion. You see the rope\nhas knots, and I know your muscles are as trustworthy in such work as\nmy own.\"\n\nThere was a slight breeze from the eastward, and the current of air\nslanting up the face of the peak assisted the balloon in mounting with\nits burden, and favored us by promptly swinging the little airship,\nwith the grapple swaying beneath it, over the brow of the cliff into\nthe atmospheric eddy above. As soon as we saw that the grapple was\nwell over the edge we pulled upon the rope. The balloon instantly shot\ninto view with the anchor dancing, but, under the influence of the\nwind, quickly returned to its former position behind the projecting\nbrink. The grapple had failed to take hold.\n\n\"'Try, try again' must be our motto now,\" muttered Hall.\n\nWe tried several times with the same result, although each time we\nslightly shifted our position. At last the grapple caught.\n\n\"Now, all together!\" cried my companion, and simultaneously we threw\nour weight upon the slender rope. The anchor apparently did not give\nan inch.\n\n\"Let me go first,\" said Hall, pushing me aside as I caught the first\nknot above my head. \"It's my device, and it's only fair that I should\nhave the first try.\"\n\nIn a minute he was many feet up the wall, climbing swiftly hand over\nhand, but occasionally stopping and twisting his leg around the rope\nwhile he took breath.\n\n\"It's easier than I expected,\" he called down, when he had ascended\nabout one hundred feet. \"Here and there the rock offers a little hold\nfor the knees.\"\n\nI watched him, breathless with anxiety, and, as he got higher, my\nimagination pictured the little gold grapple, invisible above the brow\nof the precipice, with perhaps a single thin prong wedged into a\ncrevice, and slowly ploughing its way towards the edge with each\nimpulse of the climber, until but another pull was needed to set it\nflying! So vivid was my fancy that I tried to banish it by noticing\nthat a certain knot in the rope remained just at the level of my eyes,\nwhere it had been from the start. Hall was now fully two hundred feet\nabove the ledge on which I stood, and was rapidly nearing the top of\nthe precipice. In a minute more he would be safe.\n\nSuddenly he shouted, and, glancing up with a leap of the heart, I saw\nthat he was falling! He kept his face to the rock, and came down feet\nforemost. It would be useless to attempt any description of my\nfeelings; I would not go through that experience again for the price\nof a battleship. Yet it lasted less than a second. He had dropped not\nmore than ten feet when the fall was arrested.\n\n\"All right!\" he called, cheerily. \"No harm done! It was only a slip.\"\n\nBut what a slip! If the balloon had not carried the anchor several\nyards back from the edge it would have had no opportunity to catch\nanother hold as it shot forward. And how could we know that the second\nhold would prove more secure than the first? Hall did not hesitate,\nhowever, for one instant. Up he went again. But, in fact, his best\nchance was in going up, for he was within four yards of the top when\nthe mishap occurred. With a sigh of relief I saw him at last throw his\narm over the verge and then wriggle his body upon the ledge. A few\nseconds later he was lying on his stomach, with his face over the\nedge, looking down at me.\n\n\"Come on!\" he shouted. \"It's all right.\"\n\nWhen I had pulled myself over the brink at his side I grasped his hand\nand pressed it without a word. We understood one another.\n\n\"It was pretty close to a miracle,\" he remarked at last. \"Look at\nthis.\"\n\nThe rock over which the grapple had slipped was deeply scored by the\nunyielding point of the metal, and exactly at the verge of the\nprecipice the prong had wedged itself into a narrow crack, so firmly\nthat we had to chip away the stone in order to release it. If it had\nslipped a single inch farther before taking hold it would have been\nall over with my friend.\n\nSuch experiences shake the strongest nerves, and we sat on the shelf\nwe had attained for fully a quarter of an hour before we ventured to\nattack the next precipice which hung beetling directly above us. It\nwas not as lofty as the one we had just ascended, but it impended to\nsuch a degree that we saw we should have to climb our rope while it\nswung free in the air!\n\nLuckily we had little difficulty in getting a grip for the prongs, and\nwe took every precaution to test the security of the anchorage, not\nonly putting our combined weight repeatedly upon the rope, but\nflipping and jerking it with all our strength. The grapple resisted\nevery effort to dislodge it, and finally I started up, insisting on my\nturn as leader.\n\nThe height I had to ascend did not exceed one hundred feet, but that\nis a very great distance to climb on a swinging rope, without a wall\nwithin reach to assist by its friction and occasional friendly\nprojections. In a little while my movements, together with the effect\nof the slight wind, had imparted a most distressing oscillation to the\nrope. This sometimes carried me with a nerve-shaking bang against a\nprominent point of the precipice, where I would dislodge loose\nfragments that kept Hall dodging for his life, and then I would swing\nout, apparently beyond the brow of the cliff below, so that, as I\ninvoluntarily glanced downward, I seemed to be hanging in free space,\nwhile the steep mountain-side, looking ten times steeper than it\nreally was, resembled the vertical wall of an absolutely bottomless\nabyss, as if I were suspended over the edge of the world.\n\nI avoided thinking of what the grapple might be about, and in my haste\nto get through with the awful experience I worked myself fairly out of\nbreath, so that, when at last I reached the rounded brow of the cliff,\nI had to stop and cling there for fully a minute before I could summon\nstrength enough to lift myself over it.\n\nWhen I was assured that the grapple was still securely fastened I\nsignalled to Hall, and he soon stood at my side, exclaiming, as he\nwiped the perspiration from his face:\n\n\"I think I'll try wings next time!\"\n\nBut our difficulties had only begun. As we had foreseen, it was a case\nof Alp above Alp, to the very limit of human strength and\npatience. However, it would have been impossible to go back. In order\nto descend the two precipices we had surmounted it would have been\nnecessary to leave our life-lines clinging to the rocks, and we had\nnot rope enough to do that. If we could not reach the top we were\nlost.\n\nHaving refreshed ourselves with a bite to eat and a little stimulant,\nwe resumed the climb. After several hours of the most exhausting work\nI have ever performed we pulled our weary limbs upon the narrow ridge,\nbut a few square yards in area, which constitutes the apex of the\nGrand Teton. A little below, on the opposite side of a steep-walled\ngap which divides the top of the mountain into two parts, we saw the\nsingular enclosure of stones which the early white explorers found\nthere, and which they ascribed to the Indians, although nobody has\never known who built it or what purpose it served.\n\nThe view was, of course, superb, but while I was admiring it in all\nits wonderful extent and variety, Hall, who had immediately pulled out\nhis binocular, was busy inspecting the Syx works, the top of whose\ngreat tufted smoke column was thousands of feet beneath our\nlevel. Jackson's Lake, Jenny's Lake, Leigh's Lake, and several\nlakelets glittered in the sunlight amid the pale grays and greens of\nJackson's Hole, while many a bending reach of the Snake River shone\namid the wastes of sage-brush and rock.\n\n\"There!\" suddenly exclaimed Hall, \"I thought I should find it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Take a look through my glass at the roof of Syx's mill. Look just in\nthe centre.\"\n\n\"Why, it's open in the middle!\" I cried as soon as I had put the glass\nto my eyes. \"There's a big circular hole in the centre of the roof.\"\n\n\"Look inside! Look inside!\" repeated Hall, impatiently.\n\n\"I see nothing there except something bright.\"\n\n\"Do you call it nothing because it is bright?\"\n\n\"Well, no,\" I replied, laughing. \"What I mean is that I see nothing\nthat I can make anything of except a shining object, and all I can\nmake of that is that it is bright.\"\n\n\"You've been in the Syx works many times, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see the opening in the roof?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of it?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Then Dr. Syx doesn't show his visitors everything that is to be\nseen.\"\n\n\"Evidently not since, as we know, he concealed the double tunnel and\nthe room under the furnace.\"\n\n\"Dr. Syx has concealed a bigger secret than that,\" Hall responded,\n\"and the Grand Teton has helped me to a glimpse of it.\"\n\nFor several minutes my friend was absorbed in thought. Then he broke\nout:\n\n\"I tell you he's the most wonderful man in the world!\"\n\n\"Who, Dr. Syx? Well, I've long thought that.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I mean in a different way from what you are thinking of. Do\nyou remember my asking you once if you believed in alchemy?\"\n\n\"I remember being greatly surprised by your question to that effect.\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" said Hall, rubbing his hands with a satisfied air, while\nhis eyes glanced keen and bright with the reflection of some passing\nthought, \"Max Syx is greater than any alchemist that ever lived. If\nthose old fellows in the dark ages had accomplished everything they\nset out to do, they would have been of no more consequence in\ncomparison with our black-browed friend down yonder than--than my head\nis of consequence in comparison with the moon.\"\n\n\"I fear you flatter the man in the moon,\" was my laughing reply.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" returned Hall, \"and some day you'll admit it.\"\n\n\"Well, what about that something that shines down there? You seem to\nsee more in it than I can.\"\n\nBut my companion had fallen into a reverie and didn't hear my\nquestion. He was gazing abstractedly at the faint image of the waning\nmoon, now nearing the distant mountain-top over in Idaho. Presently\nhis mind seemed to return to the old magnet, and he whirled about and\nglanced down at the Syx mill. The column of smoke was diminishing in\nvolume, an indication that the engine was about to enjoy one of its\nperiodical rests. The irregularity of these stoppages had always been\na subject of remark among practical engineers. The hours of labor were\nexceedingly erratic, but the engine had never been known to work at\nnight, except on one occasion, and then only for a few minutes, when\nit was suddenly stopped on account of a fire.\n\nJust as Hall resumed his inspection two huge quarter spheres, which\nhad been resting wide apart on the roof, moved towards one another\nuntil their arched sections met over the circular aperture which they\ncovered like the dome of an observatory.\n\n\"I expected it,\" Hall remarked. \"But come, it is mid-afternoon, and we\nshall need all of our time to get safely down before the light fades.\"\n\nAs I have already explained, it would not have been possible for us to\nreturn the way we came. We determined to descend the comparatively\neasy western slopes of the peak, and pass the night on that side of\nthe mountain. Letting ourselves down with the rope into the hollow way\nthat divides the summit of the Teton into two pinnacles, we had no\ndifficulty in descending by the route followed by all previous\nclimbers. The weather was fine, and, having found good shelter among\nthe rocks, we passed the night in comfort. The next day we succeeded\nin swinging round upon the eastern flank of the Teton, below the more\nformidable cliffs, and, just at nightfall, we arrived at the\nstation. As we passed the Syx mine the doctor himself confronted\nus. There was a very displeasing look on his dark countenance, and his\nsneer was strongly marked.\n\n\"So you have been on top of the Teton?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Hall, very blandly, \"and if you have a taste for that\nsort of thing I should advise you to go up. The view is immense, as\nfine as the best in the Alps.\"\n\n\"Pretty ingenious plan, that balloon of yours,\" continued the doctor,\nstill looking black.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Hall replied, more suavely than ever. \"I've been planning\nthat a long time. You probably don't know that mountaineering used to\nbe my chief amusement.\"\n\nThe doctor turned away without pursuing the conversation.\n\n\"I could kick myself,\" Hall muttered as soon as Dr. Syx was out of\nearshot. \"If my absurd wish to outdo others had not blinded me, I\nshould have known that he would see us going up this side of the peak,\nparticularly with the balloon to give us away. However, what's done\ncan't be undone. He may not really suspect the truth, and if he does\nhe can't help himself, even though he is the richest man in the\nworld.\"\n\n\n\nXI\n\nSTRANGE FATE OF A KITE\n\n\"Are you ready for another tramp?\" was Andrew Hall's greeting when we\nmet early on the morning following our return from the peak.\n\n\"Certainly I am. What is your programme for to-day?\"\n\n\"I wish to test the flying qualities of a kite which I have\nconstructed since our return last night.\"\n\n\"You don't allow the calls of sleep to interfere very much with your\nactivity.\"\n\n\"I haven't much time for sleep just now,\" replied Hall, without\nsmiling. \"The kite test will carry us up the flanks of the Teton, but\nI am not going to try for the top this time. If you will come along\nI'll ask you to help me by carrying and operating a light transit I\nshall carry another myself. I am desirous to get the elevation that\nthe kite attains and certain other data that will be of use to me. We\nwill make a detour towards the south, for I don't want old Syx's\nsuspicions to be prodded any more.\"\n\n\"What interest can he have in your kite-flying?\"\n\n\"The same interest that a burglar has in the rap of a policeman's\nnight-stick.\"\n\n\"Then your experiment to-day has some connection with the solution of\nthe great mystery?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Hall, laying his hand on my shoulder, \"until I\nsee the end of that mystery I shall think of nothing else.\"\n\nIn a few hours we were clambering over the broken rocks on the\nsouth-eastern flank of the Teton at an elevation of about three\nthousand feet above the level of Jackson's Hole. Finally Hall paused\nand began to put his kite together. It was a small box-shaped affair,\nvery light in construction, with paper sides.\n\n\"In order to diminish the chances of Dr. Syx noticing what we are\nabout,\" he said, as he worked away, \"I have covered the kite with\nsky-blue paper. This, together with distance, will probably insure us\nagainst his notice.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the kite was ready. Having ascertained the direction\nof the wind with much attention, he stationed me with my transit on a\ncommanding rock, and sought another post for himself at a distance of\ntwo hundred yards, which he carefully measured with a gold tape. My\ninstructions were to keep the telescope on the kite as soon as it had\nattained a considerable height, and to note the angle of elevation and\nthe horizontal angle with the base line joining our points of\nobservation.\n\n\"Be particularly careful,\" was Hall's injunction, \"and if anything\nhappens to the kite by all means note the angles at that instant.\"\n\nAs soon as we had fixed our stations Hall began to pay out the string,\nand the kite rose very swiftly. As it sped away into the blue it was\nsoon practically invisible to the naked eye, although the telescope of\nthe transit enabled me to follow it with ease.\n\nGlancing across now and then at my companion, I noticed that he was\nhaving considerable difficulty in, at the same time, managing the kite\nand manipulating his transit. But as the kite continued to rise and\nsteadied in position his task became easier, until at length he ceased\nto remove his eye from the telescope while holding the string with\noutstretched hand.\n\n\"Don't lose sight of it now for an instant!\" he shouted.\n\nFor at least half an hour he continued to manipulate the string,\nsending the kite now high towards the zenith with a sudden pull, and\nthen letting it drift off. It seemed at last to become almost a fixed\npoint. Very slowly the angles changed, when, suddenly, there was a\nflash, and to my amazement I saw the paper of the kite shrivel and\ndisappear in a momentary flame, and then the bare sticks came tumbling\nout of the sky.\n\n\"Did you get the angles?\" yelled Hall, excitedly.\n\n\"Yes; the telescope is yet pointed on the spot where the kite\ndisappeared.\"\n\n\"Read them off,\" he called, \"and then get your angle with the Syx\nworks.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I replied, doing as he had requested, and noticing at the\nsame time that he was in the act of putting his watch in his\npocket. \"Is there anything else?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, that will do, thank you.\"\n\nHall came running over, his face beaming, and with the air of a man\nwho has just hooked a particularly cunning old trout.\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"this has been a great success! I could almost\ndispense with the calculation, but it is best to be sure.\"\n\n\"What are you about, anyhow?\" I asked, \"and what was it that happened\nto the kite?\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt me just now, please,\" was the only reply I received.\n\nThereupon my friend sat down on a rock, pulled out a pad of paper,\nnoted the angles which I had read on the transit, and fell to figuring\nwith feverish haste. In the course of his work he consulted a pocket\nalmanac, then glanced up at the sky, muttered approvingly, and finally\nleaped to his feet with a half-suppressed \"Hurrah!\" If I had not known\nhim so well I should have thought that he had gone daft.\n\n\"Will you kindly tell me,\" I asked, \"how you managed to set the kite\nafire?\"\n\nHall laughed heartily. \"You though it was a trick, did you?\" said\nhe. \"Well, it was no trick, but a very beautiful demonstration. You\nsurely haven't forgotten the scarlet tanager that gave you such a\nsurprise the day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" I exclaimed, startled at the suggestion, \"that the fate\nof the bird had any connection with the accident to your kite?\"\n\n\"Accident isn't precisely the right word,\" replied Hall. \"The two\nthings are as intimately related as own brothers. If you should care\nto hunt up the kite sticks, you would find that they, too, are now\nartemisium plated.\"\n\n\"This is getting too deep for me,\" was all that I could say.\n\n\"I am not absolutely confident that I have touched bottom myself,\"\nsaid Hall, \"but I'm going to make another dive, and if I don't bring\nup treasures greater than Vanderdecken found at the bottom of the sea,\nthen Dr. Syx is even a more wonderful human mystery than I have\nthought him to be.\"\n\n\"What do you propose to do next?\"\n\n\"To shake the dust of the Grand Teton from my shoes and go to San\nFrancisco, where I have an extensive laboratory.\"\n\n\"So you are going to try a little alchemy yourself, are you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps; who knows? At any rate, my good friend, I am forever\nindebted to you for your assistance, and even more for your\ndiscretion, and if I succeed you shall be the first person in the\nworld to hear the news.\"\n\n\n\nXII\n\nBETTER THAN ALCHEMY\n\nI come now to a part of my narrative which would have been deemed\naltogether incredible in those closing years of the nineteenth century\nthat witnessed the first steps towards the solution of the deepest\nmysteries of the ether, although men even then held in their hands,\nwithout knowing it, powers which, after they had been mastered and\nbefore use had made them familiar, seemed no less than godlike.\n\nFor six months after Hall's departure for San Francisco I heard\nnothing from him. Notwithstanding my intense desire to know what he\nwas doing, I did not seek to disturb him in his retirement. In the\nmeantime things ran on as usual in the world, only a ripple being\ncaused by renewed discoveries of small nuggets of artemisium on the\nTetons, a fact which recalled to my mind the remark of my friend when\nhe dislodged a flake of the metal from a crevice during our ascent of\nthe peak. At last one day I received this telegram at my office in New\nYork:\n\n\"SAN FRANCISCO, May 16, 1940.\n\n\"Come at once. The mystery is solved.\n\n\"(Signed) HALL.\"\n\nAs soon as I could pack a grip I was flying westward one hundred miles\nan hour. On reaching San Francisco, which had made enormous strides\nsince the opening of the twentieth century, owing to the extension of\nour Oriental possessions, and which already ranked with New York and\nChicago among the financial capitals of the world, I hastened to\nHall's laboratory. He was there expecting me, and, after a hearty\ngreeting, during which his elation over his success was manifest, he\nsaid:\n\n\"I am compelled to ask you to make a little journey. I found it\nimpossible to secure the necessary privacy here, and, before opening\nmy experiments, I selected a site for a new laboratory in an\nunfrequented spot among the mountains this side of Lake Tahoe. You\nwill be the first man, with the exception of my two devoted\nassistants, to see my apparatus, and you shall share the sensation of\nthe critical experiment.\"\n\n\"Then you have not yet completed your solution of the secret?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have; for I am as certain of the result as if I had seen it,\nbut I thought you were entitled to be in with me at the death.\"\n\nFrom the nearest railway station we took horses to the laboratory,\nwhich occupied a secluded but most beautiful site at an elevation of\nabout six thousand feet above sea-level. With considerable surprise I\nnoticed a building surmounted with a dome, recalling what we had seen\nfrom the Grand Teton on the roof of Dr. Syx's mill. Hall, observing my\nlook, smiled significantly, but said nothing. The laboratory proper\noccupied a smaller building adjoining the domed structure. Hall led\nthe way into an apartment having but a single door and illuminated by\na skylight.\n\n\"This is my sanctum sanctorum,\" he said, \"and you are the first\noutsider to enter it. Seat yourself comfortably while I proceed to\nunveil a little corner of the artemisium mystery.\"\n\nNear one end of the room, which was about thirty feet in length, was a\ntable, on which lay a glass tube about two inches in diameter and\nthirty inches long. In the farther end of the tube gleamed a lump of\nyellow metal, which I took to be gold. Hall and I were seated near\nanother table about twenty-five feet distant from the tube, and on\nthis table was an apparatus furnished with a concave mirror, whose\noptical axis was directed towards the tube. It occurred to me at once\nthat this apparatus would be suitable for experimenting with electric\nwaves. Wires ran from it to the floor, and in the cellar beneath was\naudible the beating of an engine. My companion made an adjustment or\ntwo, and then remarked:\n\n\"Now, keep your eyes on the lump of gold in the farther end of the\ntube yonder.  The tube is exhausted of air, and I am about to\nconcentrate upon the gold an intense electric influence, which will\nhave the effect of making it a kind of kathode pole. I only use this\nterm for the sake of illustration. You will recall that as long ago as\nthe days of Crookes it was known that a kathode in an exhausted tube\nwould project particles, or atoms, of its substance away in straight\nlines. Now watch!\"\n\nI fixed my attention upon the gold, and presently saw it enveloped in\na most beautiful violet light. This grew more intense, until, at\ntimes, it was blinding, while, at the same moment, the interior of the\ntube seemed to have become charged with a luminous vapor of a delicate\npinkish hue.\n\n\"Watch! Watch!\" said Hall. \"Look at the nearer end of the tube!\"\n\n\"Why, it is becoming coated with gold!\" I exclaimed.\n\nHe smiled, but made no reply. Still the strange process continued. The\npink vapor became so dense that the lump of gold was no longer\nvisible, although the eye of violet light glared piercingly through\nthe colored fog. Every second the deposit of metal, shining like a\nmirror, increased, until suddenly there came a curious whistling\nsound. Hall, who had been adjusting the mirror, jerked away his hand\nand gave it a flip, as if hot water had spattered it, and then the\nlight in the tube quickly died away, the vapor escaped, filling the\nroom with a peculiar stimulating odor, and I perceived that the end of\nthe glass tube had been melted through, and the molten gold was slowly\ndripping from it.\n\n\"I carried it a little too far,\" said Hall, ruefully rubbing the back\nof his hand, \"and when the glass gave way under the atomic bombardment\na few atoms of gold visited my bones. But there is no harm done. You\nobserved that the instant the air reached the kathode, as I for\nconvenience call the electrified mass of gold, the action ceased.\"\n\n\"But your anode, to continue your simile,\" I said, \"is constantly\nexposed to the air.\"\n\n\"True,\" he replied, \"but in the first place, of course, this is not\nreally an anode, just as the other is not actually a kathode. As\nscience advances we are compelled, for a time, to use old terms in a\nnew sense until a fresh nomenclature can be invented. But we are now\ndealing with a form of electric action more subtile in its effects\nthan any at present described in the text-books and the transactions\nof learned societies. I have not yet even attempted to work out the\ntheory of it. I am only concerned with its facts.\"\n\n\"But wonderful as the exhibition you have given is, I do not see,\" I\nsaid, \"how it concerns Dr. Syx and his artemisium.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" replied Hall, settling back in his chair after disconnecting\nhis apparatus. \"You no doubt have been told how one night the Syx\nengine was heard working for a few minutes, the first and only night\nwork it was ever known to have done, and how, hardly had it started up\nwhen a fire broke out in the mill, and the engine was instantly\nstopped. Now there is a very remarkable story connected with that, and\nit will show you how I got my first clew to the mystery, although it\nwas rather a mere suspicion than a clew, for at first I could make\nnothing out of it. The alleged fire occurred about a fortnight after\nour discovery of the double tunnel. My mind was then full of\nsuspicions concerning Syx, because I thought that a man who would fool\npeople with one hand was not likely to deal fairly with the other.\n\n\"It was a glorious night, with a full moon, whose face was so clear in\nthe limpid air that, having found a snug place at the foot of a\nyellow-pine-tree, where the ground was carpeted with odoriferous\nneedles, I lay on my back and renewed my early acquaintance with the\nromantically named mountains and 'seas' of the Lunar globe. With my\nbinocular I could trace those long white streaks which radiate from\nthe crater ring, called 'Tycho,' and run hundreds of miles in all\ndirections over the moon. As I gazed at these singular objects I\nrecalled the various theories which astronomers, puzzled by their\nenigmatical aspect, have offered to a more or less confiding public\nconcerning them.\n\n\"In the midst of my meditation and moon gazing I was startled by\nhearing the engine in the Syx works suddenly begin to run. Immediately\na queer light, shaped like the beam of a ship's searchlight, but\nreddish in color, rose high in the moonlit heavens above the mill. It\ndid not last more than a minute or two, for almost instantly the\nengine was stopped, and with its stoppage the light faded and soon\ndisappeared. The next day Dr. Syx gave it out that on starting up his\nengine in the night something had caught fire, which compelled him\nimmediately to shut down again. The few who had seen the light, with\nthe exception of your humble servant, accepted the doctor's\nexplanation without a question. But I knew there had been no fire, and\nSyx's anxiety to spread the lie led me to believe that he had narrowly\nescaped giving away a vital secret. I said nothing about my\nsuspicions, but upon inquiry I found out that an extra and pressing\norder for metal had arrived from the Austrian government the very day\nof the pretended fire, and I drew the inference that Syx, in his haste\nto fill the order--his supply having been drawn low--had started to\nwork, contrary to his custom, at night, and had immediately found\nreason to repent his rashness. Of course, I connected the strange\nlight with this sudden change of mind.\n\n\"My suspicion having been thus stimulated, and having been directed in\na certain way, I began, from that moment to notice closely the hours\nduring which the engine labored. At night it was always quiet, except\non that one brief occasion. Sometimes it began early in the morning\nand stopped about noon. At other times the work was done entirely in\nthe afternoon, beginning sometimes as late as three or four o'clock,\nand ceasing invariably at sundown. Then again it would start at\nsunrise and continue the whole day through.\n\n\"For a long time I was unable to account for these eccentricities, and\nthe problem was not rendered much clearer, although a startling\nsuggestiveness was added to it, when, at length, I noticed that the\nperiods of activity of the engine had a definite relation to the age\nof the moon. Then I discovered, with the aid of an almanac, that I\ncould predict the hours when the engine would be busy. At the time of\nnew moon it worked all day; at full moon, it was idle; between full\nmoon and last quarter, it labored in the forenoon, the length of its\nworking hours increasing as the quarter was approached; between last\nquarter and new moon, the hours of work lengthened, until, as I have\nsaid, at new moon they lasted all day; between new moon and first\nquarter, work began later and later in the forenoon as the quarter was\napproached, and between first quarter and full moon the laboring hours\nrapidly shortened, being confined to the latter part of the afternoon,\nuntil at full moon complete silence reigned in the mill.\"\n\n\"Well! well!\" I broke in, greatly astonished by Hall's singular\nrecital, \"you must have thought Dr. Syx was a cross between an\nalchemist and an astrologer.\"\n\n\"Note this,\" said Hall, disregarding my interruption, \"the hours when\nthe engine worked were invariably the hours during which the moon was\nabove the horizon!\"\n\n\"What did you infer from that?\" \"Of course, I inferred that the moon\nwas directly concerned in the mystery; but how? That bothered me for a\nlong time, but a little light broke into my mind when I picked up, on\nthe mountain-side, a dead bird, whose scorched feathers were bronzed\nwith artemisium, and sometime later another similar victim of a\nmysterious form of death. Then came the attack on the mine and its\ntragic finish. I have already told you what I observed on that\noccasion. But, instead of helping to clear up the mystery, it rather\ncomplicated it for a time. At length, however, I reasoned my way\npartly out of the difficulty. Certain things which I had noticed in\nthe Syx mill convinced me that there was a part of the building whose\nexistence no visitor suspected, and, putting one thing with another, I\ninferred that the roof must be open above that secret part of the\nstructure, and that if I could get upon a sufficiently elevated place\nI could see something of what was hidden there.\n\n\"At this point in the investigation I proposed to you the trip to the\ntop of the Teton, the result of which you remember. I had calculated\nthe angles with great care, and I felt certain that from the apex of\nthe mountain I should be able to get a view into the concealed\nchamber, and into just that side of it which I wished particularly to\ninspect. You remember that I called your attention to a shining object\nunderneath the circular opening in the roof. You could not make out\nwhat it was, but I saw enough to convince me that it was a gigantic\nparabolic mirror. I'll show you a smaller one of the same kind\npresently.\n\n\"Now, at last, I began to perceive the real truth, but it was so\nwildly incredible, so infinitely remote from all human experience,\nthat I hardly ventured to formulate it, even in my own secret\nmind. But I was bound to see the thing through to the end. It occurred\nto me that I could prove the accuracy of my theory with the aid of a\nkite. You were kind enough to lend your assistance in that experiment,\nand it gave me irrefragable evidence of the existence of a shaft of\nflying atoms extending in a direct line between Dr. Syx's pretended\nmine and the moon!\"\n\n\"Hall!\" I exclaimed, \"you are mad!\" My friend smiled good-naturedly,\nand went on with his story.\n\n\"The instant the kite shrivelled and disappeared I understood why the\nworks were idle when the moon was not above the horizon, why birds\nflying across that fatal beam fell dead upon the rocks, and whence the\nterrible master of that mysterious mill derived the power of\ndestruction that could wither an army as the Assyrian host in Byron's\npoem\n\n  \"Melted like snow in the glance of the Lord.\"\n\n\"But how did Dr. Syx turn the flying atoms against his enemies?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"In a very simple manner. He had a mirror mounted so that it could be\nturned in any direction, and would shunt the stream of metallic atoms,\nheated by their friction with the air, towards any desired point. When\nthe attack came he raised this machine above the level of the roof and\nswept the mob to a lustrous, if expensive, death.\"\n\n\"And the light at night--\"\n\n\"Was the shining of the heated atoms, not luminous enough to be\nvisible in broad day, for which reason the engine never worked at\nnight, and the stream of volatilized artemisium was never set flowing\nat full moon, when the lunar globe is above the horizon only during\nthe hours of darkness.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said, \"whence came the nuggets on the mountain. Some of the\natoms, owing to the resistance of the air, fell short and settled in\nthe form of impalpable dust until the winds and rains collected and\ncompacted them in the cracks and crevices of the rocks.\"\n\n\"That was it, of course.\"\n\n\"And now,\" I added, my amazement at the success of Hall's experiments\nand the accuracy of his deductions increasing every moment, \"do you\nsay that you have also discovered the means employed by Dr. Syx to\nobtain artemisium from the moon?\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" replied my friend, \"but within the next few minutes I\nshall have the pleasure of presenting to you a button of moon metal,\nfresh from the veins of Artemis herself.\"\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nTHE LOOTING OF THE MOON\n\nI shall spare the reader a recital of the tireless efforts, continuing\nthrough many almost sleepless weeks, whereby Andrew Hall obtained his\nclew to Dr. Syx's method. It was manifest from the beginning that the\nagent concerned must be some form of etheric, or so-called electric,\nenergy; but how to set it in operation was the problem. Finally he hit\nupon the apparatus for his initial experiments which I have already\ndescribed.\n\n\"Recurring to what had been done more than half a century ago by\nHertz, when he concentrated electric waves upon a focal point by means\nof a concave mirror,\" said Hall, \"I saw that the key I wanted lay in\nan extension of these experiments. At last I found that I could\ntransform the energy of an engine into undulations of the ether,\nwhich, when they had been concentrated upon a metallic object, like a\nchunk of gold, imparted to it an intense charge of an apparently\nelectric nature. Upon thus charging a metallic body enclosed in a\nvacuum, I observed that the energy imparted to it possessed the\nremarkable power of disrupting its atoms and projecting them off in\nstraight lines, very much as occurs with a kathode in a Crookes's\ntube. But--and this was of supreme importance--I found that the line\nof projection was directly towards the apparatus from which the\nimpulse producing the charge had come. In other words, I could produce\ntwo poles between which a marvellous interaction occurred.  My\ntransformer, with its concentrating mirror, acted as one pole, from\nwhich energy was transferred to the other pole, and that other pole\nimmediately flung off atoms of its own substance in the direction of\nthe transformer.  But these atoms were stopped by the glass wall of\nthe vacuum tube; and when I tried the experiment with the metal\nremoved from the vacuum, and surrounded with air, it failed utterly.\n\n\"This at first completely discouraged me, until I suddenly remembered\nthat the moon is in a vacuum, the great vacuum of interplanetary\nspace, and that it possesses no perceptible atmosphere of its own. At\nthis a great light broke around me, and I shouted 'Eureka!' Without\nhesitation I constructed a transformer of great power, furnished with\na large parabolic mirror to transmit the waves in parallel lines,\nerected the machinery and buildings here, and when all was ready for\nthe final experiment I telegraphed for you.\"  Prepared by these\nexplanations I was all on fire to see the thing tried. Hall was no\nless eager, and, calling in his two faithful assistants to make the\nfinal adjustments, he led the way into what he facetiously named \"the\nlunar chamber.\"\n\n\"If we fail,\" he remarked with a smile that had an element of\nworriment in it, \"it will become the 'lunatic chamber'--but no danger\nof that. You observe this polished silver knob, supported by a\nmetallic rod curved over at the top like a crane. That constitutes the\npole from which I propose to transmit the energy to the moon, and upon\nwhich I expect the storm of atoms to be centred by reflection from the\nmirror at whose focus it is placed.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" I said. \"Am I to understand that you think that the moon\nis a solid mass of artemisium, and that no matter where your radiant\nforce strikes it a 'kathodic pole' will be formed there from which\natoms will be projected to the earth?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hall, \"I must carefully choose the point on the lunar\nsurface where to operate. But that will present no difficulty. I made\nup my mind as soon as I had penetrated Syx's secret that he obtained\nthe metal from those mystic white streaks which radiate from Tycho,\nand which have puzzled the astronomers ever since the invention of\ntelescopes. I now believe those streaks to be composed of immense\nveins of the metal that Syx has most appropriately named artemisium,\nwhich you, of course, recognize as being derived from the name of the\nGreek goddess of the moon, Artemis, whom the Romans called Diana. But\nnow to work!\"\n\nIt was less than a day past the time of new moon, and the earth's\nsatellite was too near the sun to be visible in broad daylight.\nAccordingly, the mirror had to be directed by means of knowledge of\nthe moon's place in the sky. Driven by accurate clockwork, it could be\ndepended upon to retain the proper direction when once set.\n\nWith breathless interest I watched the proceedings of my friend and\nhis assistants. The strain upon the nerves of all of us was such as\ncould not have been borne for many hours at a stretch. When everything\nhad been adjusted to his satisfaction, Hall stepped back, not without\nbetraying his excitement in flushed cheeks and flashing eyes, and\npressed a lever. The powerful engine underneath the floor instantly\nresponded. The experiment was begun.\n\n\"I have set it upon a point about a hundred miles north of Tycho,\nwhere the Yerkes photographs show a great abundance of the white\nsubstance,\" said Hall.\n\nThen we waited. A minute elapsed. A bird, fluttering in the opening\nabove, for a second or two, wrenched our strained nerves. Hall's face\nturned pale.\n\n\"They had better keep away from here,\" he whispered, with a ghastly\nsmile.\n\nTwo minutes! I could hear the beating of my heart. The engine shook\nthe floor.\n\nThree minutes! Hall's face was wet with perspiration. The bird\nblundered in and startled us again.\n\nFour minutes! We were like statues, with all eyes fixed on the\npolished ball of silver, which shone in the brilliant light\nconcentrated upon it by the mirror.\n\nFive minutes! The shining ball had become a confused blue, and I\nviolently winked to clear my vision.\n\n\"At last! Thank God! Look! There it is!\"\n\nIt was Hall who spoke, trembling like an aspen. The silver knob had\nchanged color. What seemed a miniature rainbow surrounded it, with\nconcentric circles of blinding brilliance.\n\nThen something dropped flashing into an earthen dish set beneath the\nball! Another glittering drop followed, and, at a shorter interval,\nanother!\n\nAlmost before a word could be uttered the drops had coalesced and\nbecome a tiny stream, which, as it fell, twisted itself into a bright\nspiral, gleaming with a hundred shifting hues, and forming on the\nbottom of the dish a glowing, interlacing maze of viscid rings and\ncirclets, which turned and twined about and over one another, until\nthey had blended and settled into a button-shaped mass of hot metallic\njelly. Hall snatched the dish away, and placed another in its stead.\n\n\"This will be about right for a watch charm when it cools,\" he said,\nwith a return of his customary self-command. \"I promised you the first\nspecimen. I'll catch another for myself.\"\n\n\"But can it be possible that we are not dreaming?\" I exclaimed. \"Do\nyou really believe that this comes from the moon?\"\n\n\"Just as surely as rain comes from the clouds,\" cried Hall, with all\nhis old impatience. \"Haven't I just showed you the whole process?\"\n\n\"Then I congratulate you. You will be as rich as Dr. Syx.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" was the unperturbed reply, \"but not until I have enlarged\nmy apparatus. At present I shall hardly do more than supply mementoes\nto my friends. But since the principle is established, the rest is\nmere detail.\"\n\nSix weeks later the financial centres of the earth were shaken by the\nnews that a new supply of artemisium was being marketed from a mill\nwhich had been secretly opened in the Sierras of California. For a\ntime there was almost a panic. If Hall had chosen to do so, he might\nhave precipitated serious trouble. But he immediately entered into\nnegotiations with government representatives, and the inevitable\nresult was that, to preserve the monetary system of the world from\nupheaval, Dr. Syx had to consent that Hall's mill should share equally\nwith his in the production of artemisium. During the negotiations the\ndoctor paid a visit to Hall's establishment. The meeting between them\nwas most dramatic. Syx tried to blast his rival with a glance, but\nknowledge is power, and my friend faced his mysterious antagonist,\nwhose deepest secrets he had penetrated, with an unflinching eye. It\nwas remarked that Dr. Syx became a changed man from that moment. His\nmasterful air seemed to have deserted him, and it was with something\nresembling humility that he assented to the arrangement which required\nhim to share his enormous gains with his conqueror.\n\nOf course, Hall's success led to an immediate recrudescence of the\nefforts to extract artemisium from the Syx ore, and, equally of\ncourse, every such attempt failed. Hall, while keeping his own secret,\ndid all he could to discourage the experiments, but they naturally\nbelieved that he must have made the very discovery which was the\nsubject of their dreams, and he could not, without betraying himself,\nand upsetting the finances of the planet, directly undeceive them. The\nconsequence was that fortunes were wasted in hopeless experimentation,\nand, with Hall's achievement dazzling their eyes, the deluded\nfortune-seekers kept on in the face of endless disappointments and\ndisaster.\n\nAnd presently there came another tragedy. The Syx mill was blown up!\nThe accident--although many people refused to regard it as an\naccident, and asserted that the doctor himself, in his chagrin, had\napplied the match--the explosion, then, occurred about sundown, and\nits effects were awful. The great works, with everything pertaining to\nthem, and every rail that they contained, were blown to atoms. They\ndisappeared as if they had never existed. Even the twin tunnels were\ninvolved in the ruin, a vast cavity being left in the mountain-side\nwhere Syx's ten acres had been. The force of the explosion was so\ngreat that the shattered rock was reduced to dust. To this fact was\nowing the escape of the troops camped near. While the mountain was\nshaken to its core, and enormous parapets of living rock were hurled\ndown the precipices of the Teton, no missiles of appreciable size\ntraversed the air, and not a man at the camp was injured. But\nJackson's Hole, filled with red dust, looked for days afterwards like\nthe mouth of a tremendous volcano just after an eruption. Dr. Syx had\nbeen seen entering the mill a few minutes before the catastrophe by a\nsentinel who was stationed about a quarter of a mile away, and who,\nalthough he was felled like an ox by the shock, and had his eyes,\nears, and nostrils filled with flying dust, miraculously escaped with\nhis life.\n\nAfter this a new arrangement was made whereby Andrew Hall became the\nsole producer of artemisium, and his wealth began to mount by leaps of\nmillions towards the starry heights of the billions.\n\nAbout a year after the explosion of the Syx mill a strange rumor got\nabout. It came first from Budapest, in Hungary, where it was averred\nseveral persons of credibility had seen Dr. Max Syx. Millions had been\nfamiliar with his face and his personal peculiarities, through\nactually meeting him, as well as through photographs and descriptions,\nand, unless there was an intention to deceive, it did not seem\npossible that a mistake could be made in identification. There surely\nnever was another man who looked just like Dr. Syx. And, besides, was\nit not demonstrable that he must have perished in the awful\ndestruction of his mill?\n\nSoon after came a report that Dr. Syx had been seen again; this time\nat Ekaterinburg, in the Urals. Next he was said to have paid a visit\nto Batang, in the mountainous district of southwestern China, and\nfinally, according to rumor, he was seen in Sicily, at Nicolosi, among\nthe volcanic pimples on the southern slope of Mount Etna.\n\nNext followed something of more curious and even startling interest. A\nchemist at Budapest, where the first rumors of Syx's reappearance had\nplaced the mysterious doctor, announced that he could produce\nartemisium, and proved it, although he kept his process secret. Hardly\nhad the sensation caused by this news partially subsided when a\nsimilar report arrived from Ekaterinburg; then another from Batang;\nafter that a fourth from Nicolosi!\n\nNobody could fail to notice the coincidence; wherever the doctor--or\nwas it his ghost?--appeared, there, shortly afterwards, somebody\ndiscovered the much-sought secret.\n\nAfter this Syx's apparitions rapidly increased in frequency, followed\nin each instance by the announcement of another productive artemisium\nmill. He appeared in Germany, Italy, France, England, and finally at\nmany places in the United States.\n\n\"It is the old doctor's revenge,\" said Hall to me one day, trying to\nsmile, although the matter was too serious to be taken humorously.\n\"Yes, it is his revenge, and I must admit that it is complete. The\nprice of artemisium has fallen one-half within six months. All the\nefforts we have made to hold back the flood have proved useless. The\nsecret itself is becoming public property. We shall inevitably be\noverwhelmed with artemisium, just as we were with gold, and the last\ncondition of the financial world will be worse than the first.\"\n\nMy friend's gloomy prognostications came near being fulfilled to the\nletter. Ten thousand artemisium mills shot their etheric rays upon the\nmoon, and our unfortunate satellite's metal ribs were stripped by\natomic force. Some of the great white rays that had been one of the\ntelescopic wonders of the lunar landscapes disappeared, and the face\nof the moon, which had remained unchanged before the eyes of the\nchildren of Adam from the beginning of their race, now looked as if\nthe blast of a furnace had swept it. At night, on the moonward side,\nthe earth was studded with brilliant spikes, all pointed at the heart\nof its child in the sky.\n\nBut the looting of the moon brought disaster to the robber planet. So\nmad were the efforts to get the precious metal that the surface of our\nglobe was fairly showered with it, productive fields were, in some\ncases, almost smothered under a metallic coating, the air was filled\nwith shining dust, until finally famine and pestilence joined hands\nwith financial disaster to punish the grasping world.\n\nThen, at last, the various governments took effective measures to\nprotect themselves and their people. Another combined effort resulted\nin an international agreement whereby the production of the precious\nmoon metal was once more rigidly controlled. But the existence of a\nmonopoly, such as Dr. Syx had so long enjoyed, and in the enjoyment of\nwhich Andrew Hall had for a brief period succeeded him, was henceforth\nrendered impossible.\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nTHE LAST OF DR. SYX\n\nMany years after the events last recorded I sat, at the close of a\nbrilliant autumn day, side by side with my old friend Andrew Hall, on\na broad, vine-shaded piazza which faced the east, where the full moon\nwas just rising above the rim of the Sierra, and replacing the rosy\ncounter-glow of sunset with its silvery radiance. The sight was\ncalculated to carry the minds of both back to the events of former\nyears. But I noticed that Hall quickly changed the position of his\nchair, and sat down again with his back to the rising moon. He had\nmanaged to save some millions from the wreck of his vast fortune when\nartemisium started to go to the dogs, and I was now paying him one of\nmy annual visits at his palatial home in California.\n\n\"Did I ever tell you of my last trip to the Teton?\" he asked, as I\ncontinued to gaze contemplatively at the broad lunar disk which slowly\ndetached itself from the horizon and began to swim in the clear\nevening sky.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"but I should like to hear about it.\"\n\n\"Or of my last sight of Dr. Syx?\"\n\n\"Indeed! I did not suppose that you ever saw him after that conference\nin your mill, when he had to surrender half of the world to you.\"\n\n\"Once only I saw him again,\" said Hall, with a peculiar intonation.\n\n\"Pray go ahead, and tell me the whole story.\"\n\nMy friend lighted a fresh cigar, tipped his chair into a more\ncomfortable position, and began:\n\n\"It was about seven years ago. I had long felt an unconquerable desire\nto have another look at the Teton and the scenes amid which so many\nstrange events in my life had occurred. I thought of sending for you\nto go with me, but I knew you were abroad much of your time, and I\ncould not be certain of catching you. Finally I decided to go alone. I\ntravelled on horseback by way of the Snake River canyon, and arrived\nearly one morning in Jackson's Hole. I can tell you it was a gloomy\nplace, as barren and deserted as some of those Arabian wadies that you\nhave been describing to me. The railroad had long ago been abandoned,\nand the site of the military camp could scarcely be recognized. An\nimmense cavity with ragged walls showed where Dr. Syx's mill used to\nsend up its plume of black smoke.\n\n\"As I stared up the gaunt form of the Teton, whose beetling precipices\nhad been smashed and split by the great explosion, I was seized with a\nresistless impulse to climb it. I thought I should like to peer off\nagain from that pinnacle which had once formed so fateful a\nwatch-tower for me. Turning my horse loose to graze in the grassy\nriver bottom, and carrying my rope tether along as a possible aid in\nclimbing, I set out for the ascent. I knew I could not get up the\nprecipices on the eastern side, which we were able to master with the\naid of our balloon, and so I bore round, when I reached the steepest\ncliffs, until I was on the southwestern side of the peak, where the\nclimbing was easier.\n\n\"But it took me a long time, and I did not reach the rift in the\nsummit until just before sundown. Knowing that it would be impossible\nfor me to descend at night, I bethought me of the enclosure of rocks,\nsupposed to have been made by Indians, on the western pinnacle, and\ndecided that I could pass the night there.\n\n\"The perpendicular buttress forming the easternmost and highest point\nof the Teton's head would have baffled me but for the fact that I\nfound a long crack, probably an effect of the tremendous explosion,\nextending from bottom to top of the rock. Driving my toes and fingers\ninto this rift, I managed, with a good deal of trouble, and no little\nperil, to reach the top. As I lifted myself over the edge and rose to\nmy feet, imagine my amazement at seeing Dr. Syx standing within\narm's-length of me!\n\n\"My breath seemed pent in my lungs, and I could not even utter the\nexclamation that rose to my lips. It was like meeting a\nghost. Notwithstanding the many reports of his having been seen in\nvarious parts of the world, it had always been my conviction that he\nhad perished in the explosion.\n\n\"Yet there he stood in the twilight, for the sun was hidden by the\ntime I reached the summit, his tall form erect, and his black eyes\ngleaming under the heavy brows as he fixed them sternly upon my\nface. You know I never was given to losing my nerve, but I am afraid I\nlost it on that occasion. Again and again I strove to speak, but it\nwas impossible to move my tongue. So powerless seemed my lungs that I\nwondered how I could continue breathing.\n\n\"The doctor remained silent, but his curious smile, which, as you\nknow, was a thing of terror to most people, overspread his\nblack-rimmed face and was broad enough to reveal the gleam of his\nteeth. I felt that he was looking me through and through. The\nsensation was as if he had transfixed me with an ice-cold blade. There\nwas a gleam of devilish pleasure in his eyes, as though my evident\nsuffering was a delight to him and a gratification of his\nvengeance. At length I succeeded in overcoming the feeling which\noppressed me, and, making a step forward, I shouted in a strained\nvoice,\n\n\"'You black Satan!'\n\n\"I cannot clearly explain the psychological process which led me to\nutter those words. I had never entertained any enmity towards Dr. Syx,\nalthough I had always regarded him as a heartless person, who had\npurposely led thousands to their ruin for his selfish gain, but I knew\nthat he could not help hating me, and I felt now that, in some\ninexplicable manner, a struggle, not physical, but spiritual, was\ntaking place between us, and my exclamation, uttered with surprising\nintensity, produced upon me, and apparently upon him, the effect of a\ndesperate sword thrust which attains its mark.\n\n\"Immediately the doctor's form seemed to recede, as if he had passed\nthe verge of the precipice behind him. At the same time it became dim,\nand then dimmer, until only the dark outlines, and particularly the\njet-black eyes, glaring fiercely, remained visible. And still he\nreceded, as though floating in the air, which was now silvered with\nthe evening light, until he appeared to cross the immense atmospheric\ngulf over Jackson's Hole and paused on the rim of the horizon in the\neast.\n\n\"Then, suddenly, I became aware that the full moon had risen at the\nvery place on the distant mountain-brow where the spectre rested, and\nas I continued to gaze, as if entranced, the face and figure of the\ndoctor seemed slowly to frame themselves within the lunar disk, until\nat last he appeared to have quitted the air and the earth and to be\nfrowning at me from the circle of the moon.\"\n\nWhile Hall was pronouncing his closing words I had begun to stare at\nthe moon with swiftly increasing interest, until, as his voice\nstopped, I exclaimed,\n\n\"Why, there he is now! Funny I never noticed it before. There's\nDr. Syx's face in the moon, as plain as day.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Hall, without turning round, \"and I never like to look\nat it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Moon Metal, by Garrett P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
