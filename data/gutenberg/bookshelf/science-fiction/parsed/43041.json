Maybe it's because at\ntimes (though certainly not--I hope--on as permanent a basis as Artie)\nI'm as screwy as he is. At least, I keep letting myself get sucked into\nhis plans, every time he's discovered the \"invention that will change\nthe world\". He discovers it quite a bit; something new every time.\nAnd, Artie having a natural mechanical aptitude that would probably\nrate as point-nine-nine-ad-infinitum on a scale where one-point-oh was\nperfection, all his inventions work. Except--\n\nWell, take the last thing we worked on. (He usually includes me in his\nplans because, while he's the better cooker-upper of these gadgets,\nI've got the knack for building them. Artie can't seem to slip a radio\ntube into its socket without shattering the glass, twist a screwdriver\nwithout gouging pieces out of his thumb, nor even solder an electrical\nconnection without needing skin-grafts for the hole he usually burns in\nhis hand.)\n\nSo we're a team, Artie and me. He does the planning, I do the\nconstructing. Like, as I mentioned, the last thing we worked on. He\ninvented it; I built it. A cap-remover (like for jars and ketchup\nbottles). But not just a clamp-plus-handle, like most of the same\ngadgets. Nope, this was electronic, worked on a tight-beam radio-wave,\nplus something to do with the expansion coefficients of the metals\nmaking up the caps, so that, from anyplace in line-of-sight of her home,\nthe housewife could shove a stud, and come home to find all the caps\nunscrewed on her kitchen shelves, and the contents ready for getting at.\nIt did, I'll admit, have a nice name: The Teletwist.\n\nExcept, where's the point in unscrewing caps unless you're physically\npresent to make use of the contents of the jars? I mentioned this to\nArtie when I was building the thing, but he said, \"Wait and see. It'll\nbe a novelty, like hula hoops a couple of decades back. Novelties always\ncatch on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, he was wrong. When we finally found a manufacturer softheaded\nenough to mass-produce a few thousand of the gadgets, total sales for\nthe entire country amounted to seventeen. Of course, the price was kind\nof prohibitive: Thirteen-fifty per Teletwist. Why would a housewife\nlay that kind of money on the line when she'd already, for a two-buck\nlicense, gotten a husband who could be relied upon (well, most of the\ntime) to do the same thing for her?\n\nNot, of course, that we didn't finally make money on the thing. It was\njust about that time, you'll remember, that the Imperial Martian Fleet\ndecided that the third planet from Sol was getting a bit too powerful,\nand they started orbiting our planet with ultimatums. And while they\nwere waiting for our answer, our government quietly purchased Artie's\npatent, made a few little adjustments on his cap-twister, and the _next_\nthing the Martians knew, all their airlocks were busily unscrewing\nthemselves with nothing outside them except hungry vacuum. It was also\nthe _last_ thing the Martians knew.\n\nSo Artie's ideas seem to have their uses, all right. Only, for some\nreason, Artie never thinks of the proper application for his latest\nnewfound principle. That neat little disintegrator pistol carried by the\nfootsoldiers in the Three Day War (with Venus; remember Venus?) was a\nvariation on a cute little battery-powered device of Artie's, of which\nthe original function had been to rid one's house of roaches.\n\nAt any rate--at a damned _good_ rate, in fact--the government always\nended up paying Artie (and me, as his partner-confederate-cohort) an\nanything-but-modest fee for his patents. We weren't in the millionaire\nclass, yet, but neither were we very far out of it. And we were much\nbetter off than any millionaires, since Artie had persuaded the\ngovernment to let us, in lieu of payment for another patent of his\n(for his Nixsal; the thing that was supposed to convert sea-water into\nsomething drinkable, and did: Gin.), be tax-free for the rest of our\nlives.\n\n(It was quite a concession for the government to make. But then, the\ngovernment-produced \"George Washington Gin\" is quite a concession in\nitself.)\n\nSo I guess you could say I keep listening to Artie Lindstrom because\nof the financial rewards. I must admit they're nice. And it's kind of\nadventurous, when I'm working on Artie's latest brainstorm, to let\nmyself wonder what--since I generally scrap Artie's prognosis for the\ngadget's future--the damned thing will _actually_ be used for.\n\nOr, at least, it _was_ kind of adventurous, until Artie started in on\nhis scheme of three weeks ago: a workable anti-gravity machine. And now,\nI'm feeling my first tremors of regret that I ever hooked up with the\nguy. Because--Well, it happened like this:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It looks great,\" I said, lifting my face from the blueprint, and\nnodding across the workbench at Artie. \"But what the hell does it do?\"\n\nArtie shoved a shock of dust-colored hair back off his broad, dull pink\nforehead, and jabbed excitedly with a grimy forefinger at the diagram.\n\"Can't you _tell_, Burt? What does _this_ look like!\"\n\nMy eyes returned to the conglomeration of sketchy cones beneath his\nflailing finger, and I said, as truthfully as possible, \"A pine forest\non a lumpy hill.\"\n\n\"Those,\" he said, his tone hurt as it always was when I inadvertently\nbelittled his draftmanship, \"are flywheels.\"\n\n\"Cone-shaped flywheels?\" I said. \"Why, for pete's sake?\"\n\n\"Only,\" he said, with specious casualness, \"in order to develop a\ncentrifugal thrust that runs in a _straight line_!\"\n\n\"A centr--\" I said, then sat back from the drawings, blinking. \"That's\nimpossible, Artie.\"\n\n\"And why should it be?\" he persisted. \"Picture an umbrella, with the\nfabric removed. Now twirl the handle on its axis. What do the ribs do?\"\n\n\"I suppose they splay out into a circle?\"\n\n\"Right,\" he exulted. \"And if they _impeded_ from splaying out? If,\ninstead of separate ribs, we have a hollow, bottomless cone of metal?\nWhere does the force go?\"\n\nI thought it over, then said, with deliberation, \"In _all_ directions,\nArtie. One part shoving up-to-the-right, one part up-to-the-left, like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said, his face failing to fight a mischievous grin. \"And\nsince none of them move, where does the _resultant_ force go?\"\n\nI shrugged, \"Straight up, I guess--\" Then my ears tuned in belatedly on\nwhat I'd said, and a moment later I squeaked, \"Artie! Straight _up_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe nodded eagerly. \"Or, of course, straight east, straight west, or\nwhichever way the ferrule of this here theoretical umbrella was pointed\nat the time the twirling began. The point is, we can generate pure force\nin _any_ direction. What do you think? Can you build it?\"\n\n\"It'd be child's play. In fact, Artie, it's _too_ damned simple to be\nbelieved! What's the hitch? Why hasn't anyone tried it before _now_?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" he said, his blue eyes dancing. \"Maybe no one ever thought\nof it before. You could sit down and twist a paper clip out of a hunk\nof soft wire, couldn't you? Easy as pie. But someone had to invent the\nthing, first. All the great inventions have been simple. Look at the\nwheel.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said, since I'd been sold on his gadget the moment\nI pictured that umbrella moving ferruleward like a whirling arrow.\n\"Still, it looks like you're getting something for nothing. A kind of\nby-your-own-bootstraps maneuver....\"\n\n\"An inventor,\" said Artie, quoting his favorite self-coined aphorism,\n\"must never think like a scientist!\"\n\n\"But\"--I said, more to stem the tide I expected than to really make a\ncoherent objection.\n\n\"An inventor,\" he went dreamily onward, \"is essentially a dreamer; a\nscientist is an observer. An inventor tries to make a result he wants\nhappen; a scientist tries to tell the inventor that the result cannot be\nachieved.\"\n\n\"Please. Artie. Don't tell me about the bee again.\"\n\nBut Artie told me about the bumblebee, and how there were still some\nscientists who insisted, according to the principles of aerodynamics,\nthat it was not constructed properly to enable it to fly. And about\nhow men of this short-sighted ilk were still scoffing at the ancient\nalchemist's talk of the Philosopher's Stone for transmuting metals, even\nthough transmutation of metals was being done every day in atomic piles.\nAnd how he'd theorized that there _was_ once a genuine Philosopher's\nStone, probably a hunk of pure U-235, that someone had managed to make,\nwhich might explain why so many alchemists (lacking, unfortunately, any\nknowledge of heavy radiations or Geiger counters) sort of died off in\ntheir quest for the stone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was nearly lunchtime when he finished his spiel, and I was kicking\nmyself in my short-memoried brain for having let him get onto the\nsubject, when abruptly the joyous glow behind his eyes damped its\nsparkle a bit.\n\n\"There _is_ one little hitch--\"\n\n\"I thought it looked too easy,\" I sighed, waiting for the clinker.\n\"Don't tell me it has to be made out of pure Gallium, which has the\nregrettable tendency to liquiefy at about thirty degrees centigrade? Or\nperhaps of the most elusive of its eleven isotopes?\"\n\n\"No, no, nothing like that,\" he murmured almost distractedly. \"It's the\nforce-per-gram part that's weak.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" I said unhappily, \"that this thing'll only generate\nenough force to lift itself?\"\n\nA feeble ghost of his erstwhile grin rode briefly across his lips.\n\"That's the way it works out on paper,\" he said.\n\n\"Which means,\" I realized aloud, \"that it's commercially useless,\nbecause what's the good of an anti-gravity machine that can't lift\nanything except _itself_! It falls into the class of lifeboats that\nfloat up to the gunwales in the water while still _empty_. Fun to watch,\nbut impossible to use. Hell, Artie, if that's the setup, then this\nthing wouldn't be any more help to a space-aiming government than an\naborigine's boomerang; it flies beautifully, but not if the aborigine\ntries to go _with_ it.\"\n\n\"However,\" he said, a bit more brightly, \"I've been wrong on paper\nbefore. Remember the bumblebee, Burt! _That_ theory still holds up on\npaper. But the bee still flies.\"\n\nHe had me, there. \"So you want I should build it anyhow, just on the\noff-chance that it _won't_ follow the rules of physical logic, and will\ndecide to generate a force above and beyond its own gravitic drag?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" he said happily. \"And even if it only manages to negate\nits own weight, we'll have an easier time ironing the bugs out of a\nmodel than we would out of a diagram. After all, who'd have figured that\nbeyond _Mach I_, all the lift-surfaces on a plane work in _reverse_?\"\n\nIt wasn't, I had to admit, anything that an inventor could have\nreasonably theorized at the outset.... So I locked myself in the lab for\na week, and built his gadget, while he spent his time pacing through his\nfourteen-room mansion across the way from the lab building (the \"way\"\nbeing the flat grassy region on Artie's estate that housed his swimming\npool, private heliport, and movie theatre), trying to coin a nifty name\nfor the thing. We both finished in a dead heat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI unlocked the door of the lab, blinked hard against the sting of warm\nyellow sunlight after a week of cool blue fluorescents, and just as I\nwheezed, \"Got it,\" Artie was counterpointing with, \"We'll call it The\n_Uuaa_!\" (He made four syllables out of it.)\n\n\"The Oo-oo-_ah_-ah?\" I glottaled. \"In honor of the fiftieth state, or\nwhat? I know 'aa' is a type of lava, but what the hell's 'uu', besides\nthe noise a man makes getting into an overheated bath?\"\n\nArtie pouted. \"'Uuaa' is initials. For 'Up, up, and away!' I thought it\nwas pretty good.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Why feed free fodder to the telecomics? I can hear\nthem now, doing monologues about people getting beri-beri flying from\nWalla Walla to Pago Pago on their Uuaas....\"\n\n\"So what would _you_ call it!\" he grunted.\n\n\"A bust,\" I sighed, left-thumbing over my shoulder at the lab. \"It sits\nand twirls and whistles a little, but that's about the size of it,\nArtie.\"\n\nHe spanieled with his eyes, basset-hounded with his mouth, and\norangutaned with his cheeks, then said, with dim hope, \"Did you weigh\nit? Maybe if you weighed it--\"\n\n\"Oh, it lost, all right,\" I admitted. \"When I connected the batteries,\nthe needle on the scale dropped down to zero, and stopped there. And I\nfound that I could lift the machine into the air, and it'd stay where it\nwas put, just whistling and whirling its cones. But then it started to\nsettle.\" I beckoned him back inside.\n\n\"Settle? Why?\" Artie asked.\n\n\"Dust,\" I said. \"There's always a little dust settling out of the air.\nIt doesn't weigh _much_, but it made the machine weigh at least what the\ndust-weight equalled, and down it went. Slow and easy, but down.\"\n\nArtie looked at the gadget, sitting and whistling on the floor of the\nlab, then turned a bleak-but-still-hopeful glance my way. \"Maybe--If we\ncould make a _guy_ take on a cone-shape, and whirled him--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I muttered. \"Bend over, grab his ankles, and fly anywhere in\nthe world, with his torso and legs pivoting wildly around his peaked\nbehind.\" I shook my head. \"Besides the manifestly undignified posturing\ninvolved, we have to consider the other effects; like having his\neyeballs fly out.\"\n\n\"If--If we had a bunch of men lie in a circle around a kind of\nMaypole-thing, each guy clutching the ankles of the next one....\"\n\n\"Maybe they'd be weightless, but they _still_ wouldn't go _up_,\" I\nsaid. \"Unless they could be towed, somehow. And by the time they\nlanded, they'd be too nauseous to be of any use for at least three\ndays. Always assuming, of course, that the weak-wristed member of the\nsick circlet didn't lose his grip, and have them end up playing mid-air\ncrack-the-whip before they fell.\"\n\n\"So all right, it's got a couple of bugs!\" said Artie. \"But the\nprinciple's sound, right?\"\n\n\"Well--Yeah, there you got me, Artie. The thing _cancels_ weight,\nanyhow....\"\n\n\"Swell. So we work from there,\" He rubbed his hands together joyously.\n\"And who knows what we'll come up with.\"\n\n\"_We_ never do, that's for sure,\" I mumbled.\n\nBut Artie just shrugged. \"I like surprises,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe end of the day--me working, Artie inventing--found us with some\nnew embellishments for the machine. Where it was originally a sort\nof humped metal box (the engine went inside the hump) studded with\ntoothbrush-bristle rows of counter-revolving cones (lest elementary\ntorque send the machine swinging the other way, and thus destroy the\nthrust-effect of the cones), it now had an additional feature: A helical\nflange around each cone.\n\n\"You see,\" Artie explained, while I was torching them to order from\nplate metal, \"the helices will provide _lift_ as the cones revolve.\"\n\n\"Only in the atmosphere of the planet,\" I said.\n\n\"Sure, I know. But by the time the outer limits of the air are reached,\nthe machine, with the same mass-thrust, will have less gravity-drag\nto fight, being that much farther from the Earth. The effect will be\ncumulative. The higher it gets, the more outward thrust it'll generate.\nThen nothing'll stop it!\"\n\n\"You could be right,\" I admitted, hammering out helix after helix on an\nelectric anvil (another gadget of Artie's; the self-heating anvil--The\nThermovil--had begun life as a small inspiration in Artie's mind for a\nportable toaster).\n\nIt was just after sunset when we figured the welds were cool enough so\nwe could test it. Onto the scale it went again, I flicked the toggle,\nand we stood back to watch the needle as the cones picked up speed.\nAlong with the original whistling sound made by the cones we began to\ndetect a shriller noise, one which abruptly became a genuine pain in the\near. As Artie and I became somewhat busy with screaming (the only thing\nwe could think of on the spur of the moment to counteract the terrible\nwaves of noise assaulting our tympana), it was all at once much easier\nto see the needle of the scale dropping toward zero, as the glass disc\nfacing the dial dissolved into gritty powder, along with the glass panes\nin every window in the lab, the house, the heliport, and the movie\ntheatre. (Not to mention those of a few farmhouses a couple of miles\ndown the highway, but we didn't find that out till their lawyers showed\nup with bills for damages.)\n\nSure enough, though, the thing lifted. Up it bobbed, like a metal\ndirigible with agonizing gas pains, shrieking louder by the second.\nWhen the plaster started to trickle and flake from the walls, and the\nfillings in my teeth rose to a temperature just short of incandescence,\nI decided it was time to cancel this phase of the experiment, and, with\nvery little regret, I flung a blanket-like canvas tarpaulin up and over\nthe ascending machine before it started using its helices to screw into\nthe ceiling. The cones bit into the tarpaulin, tangled, jammed, and the\nmachine--mercifully noiseless, now--crashed back onto the scale, and\nlost a lot of symmetry and a couple of rivets.\n\n\"What's Plan C?\" I said to Artie.\n\n\"_Quiet!_\" he said, either because I'd interrupted his thinking or\nbecause that was our next goal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next four days were spent in the arduous and quite tricky business\nof reaming acoustically spaced holes along the flanges. Artie's theory\nwas that if we simply (\"simply\" was his word, not mine) fixed it so\nthat the sound made by each flange (anything whirly with a hole or two\nin it is bound to make a calculated noise) was of the proper number of\nvibrations to intermesh with the compression/rarefaction phases of the\nsounds made by the other flanges, a veritable sphere of silence would be\nthereby created, since there'd be no room for any sound waves to pass\nthrough the already crowded atmosphere about the machine.\n\n\"It'll make less noise than a mouse in sneakers drooling on a blotter!\"\nenthused Artie, when I had it rigged again, and ready to go.\n\n\"Still,\" I said uncertainly, \"whether we _hear_ it or not, all that\nsoundwave-energy has to do _something_, Artie. If it turns ultrasonic,\nwe may suddenly find ourselves in a showerbath of free electrons and\neven _worse_ subatomic particles from disrupted air molecules. Or the\nlab might turn molten on us. Or--\"\n\n\"Oh, turn it _on_, Burt!\" said Artie. \"That's just a chance we have to\ntake.\"\n\n\"Don't see why we _have_ to take it....\" I groused, but I'm as curious\nas the next man, so I turned it on. (I could have arranged to do it by\nremote control, except for two pressing deterrents: One--At a remote\npoint of control, I wouldn't be able to watch what, if anything,\nthe machine did, and Two--Who knows where the _safe_ spot is where\nsoundwaves are concerned? With some sonic forces, you're safer the\n_nearer_ you get to the source.) So, like I said, I turned it on.\n\nSilence. Beautiful, blissful, silence. There before us twirled the rows\nof shiny cones, lifting slowly into the air, and there was nothing\nto hear at all. Beside me, Artie's lips moved, but I couldn't catch\na syllable. This time around, we'd looped a rope through a few metal\ngrommets in the base of the machine, and as it rose, Artie slipped the\ntrailing ends under his arms from behind, and proceeded to lash it\nacross his chest, to test the thing's lift-power. As he fumbled with the\nknot, I shouted at him, \"Use a firm hitch!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing came out, but Artie wasn't a bad lip-reader. He scowled, and\nhis lips made a \"_What?!_\" motion, so I repeated my caution. Next thing\nI knew, he was taking a poke at me, and I, to fend him off, ended up\nwrestling on the floor with him, while the untended machine burred its\nway into the ceiling, until the engine overheated and burned away the\nelectrical insulation on the wires, and the machine, plus a good two\nfeet square of lab-ceiling, once more descended to demolish the scale.\n\n\"--your language!\" Artie was snarling, as sound returned.\n\n\"All I said was 'Use a firm hitch!'\" I pleaded, trying to shove his\nshins off my floor-pinned biceps.\n\nArtie stared at me, then rocked off my prostrate body, convulsed in\na fit of laughter. \"Say it silently in front of a mirror, sometime,\"\nhe choked out. Before I had time to see what he was talking about,\nI smelled smoke, above and beyond that engendered by the scorched\ninsulation.\n\nI ran to the door, and opened it to observe the last glowing,\ncrackling timbers of the house, the theatre, and the heliport vanish\ninto hot orange sparks, in the grip of a dandy ring of fire that--in\na seventy-yard path--had burned up everything in a sixty-five to\nhundred-thirty-five yard radius of the lab.\n\n\"I told you those soundwaves had to do something,\" I said. \"Ready to\ngive up?\"\n\nBut Artie was already staring at the debris around the scale and making\nswift notes on a memo pad....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It looks awfully damned complex--\" I hedged, eight days later,\nlooking at the repaired, refurbished, and amended gadget on the table.\n\"Remember, Artie, the more parts to an invention, the more things can go\nwrong with it. In geometric progression....\"\n\n\"Unh-uh,\" he shook his head. \"Not the more parts, Burt. The more\n_moving_ parts. All we've done is added a parabolic sound-reflector, to\nforce all the waves the cones make down through a tube in the middle of\nthe machine. And we've insulated the tube to keep extraneous vibration\nfrom shattering it with super-induced metal fatigue.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"but about that _insulation_, Artie--\"\n\n\"You got a _better_ idea?\" he snapped. \"We tried rubber; it charred\nand flaked away. We tried plastics; they bubbled, melted, extruded,\nor burned. We tried metal and mineral honeycombs; they distorted,\nincandesced, fused or vaporized. Ceramic materials shattered. Fabrics\ntore, or petrified and cracked. All the regular things failed us. So\nwhat's wrong with trying something new?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Artie, nothing. But--_Cornflakes_?\"\n\n\"Well, we sogged 'em down good with water, right? And they've still got\nenough interstices between the particles to act as sound-baffles, right?\nAnd by the time they get good and hot and dry, they'll cook onto the\nmetal, right? (Ask anyone who ever tried to clean a pot after scorching\ncereal just how hard they'll stick!) And even when most of them flake\naway, the random distribution of char will circumvent any chance the\nsoundwaves have of setting up the regular pulse-beat necessary to\nfatigue the metal in the tube, okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure, Artie, it's okay, but--_Cornflakes_?\"\n\n\"I take it your objections are less scientific than they are esthetic?\"\nhe inquired.\n\n\"Well, something like that,\" I admitted. \"I mean, aw--For pete's sake,\nArtie! The patent office'll laugh at us. They'll start referring us to\nthe copyright people, as inventors of cookbooks!\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" he said philosophically. \"The thing _still_ may not _work_,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Well, _there's_ one bright spot, anyhow!\" I agreed, fiddling with the\nstarting switch. \"So okay, I'm game if you are.\"\n\n\"Let 'er rip,\" he pontificated, and I flicked the switch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt worked beautifully. Not even a faint hum. The only way we could tell\nit was working was from the needle on the--rebuilt again--scale, as it\ndropped lazily down to the zero mark. Our ears didn't sting, no glass\nwent dusting into crystalline powder, and a quick peek through the door\nshowed no ring of fire surrounding the lab.\n\n\"We may just have _done_ it!\" I said, hopefully, as the silver-nosed\nmachine began to float upward (We hadn't _had_ to mount the parabolic\nreflector in the position of a nose-cone, but it made the thing look\nneater, somehow.)\n\nIt seemed a little torpid in its ascent, but that could be credited to\nthe extra weight of the reflector and cornflakes, not to mention the\nfact that the helices had to suck all their air in under the lip of the\nsilvery nose-cone before they could thrust properly. But its rise was\nsteady. Six inches, ten inches--\n\nThen, at precisely one foot in height, something unexpected happened.\nUnder the base of the machine, where the sound-heated air was at its\nmost torrid, a shimmering disc-like thing began to materialize, and\nwarp, and hollow out slightly, and beside it, a glinting metal rod-thing\nflattened at one end, then the flat end went concave in the center and\nkind of oval about the perimeter, and something brownish and shreddy\nplopped and hissed into the now-very-concave disc-like thing.\n\n\"Artie--!\" I said, uneasily, but by then, he, too, had recognized the\nobjects for what they were.\n\n\"Burt--\" he said excitedly. \"Do you realize what we've done? We've\ninvented a _syntheticizer_!\"\n\nEven as he was saying it, the objects completed their mid-air\nmaterialization (time: five seconds, start to finish), and clattered\nand clinked onto the scale. We stood and looked down at them: A bowl of\ncornflakes and a silver spoon.\n\n\"How--?\" I said, but Artie was already figuring it out, aloud.\n\n\"It's the soundwaves,\" he said. \"At ultrasonic, molecule-disrupting\nvibrations, they're doing just what that Philosopher's Stone was\nsupposed to: Transmuting. Somehow, we didn't clean out the reflector\nsufficiently, and some of the traces of our other trial insulations\nremained inside. The ceramics formed the bowl, the metals formed the\nspoon, the cornflakes formed the cornflakes!\"\n\n\"But,\" I said logically (or as logically as could be expected under the\ncircumstances), \"what about the rubber, or the fabrics?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArtie's face lit up, and he nodded toward the machine, still hovering at\none foot above the scale. In its wake, amid the distorting turbulence of\nthe sound-tortured air, two more objects were materializing: a neatly\nfolded damask napkin, and a small rubber toothpick. As they dropped down\nto join their predecessors, the machine gave a satisfied shake, and\nrose steadily to the two-foot level. I was scribbling frantically in my\nnotebook: _Bowl + cereal + spoon: 5 seconds. Lag: 10 seconds. Napkin +\ntoothpick: 3 seconds. Total synthesizing time: 18 seconds. Allowance for\nrise of machine per foot: 2 seconds._\n\n\"Burt--!\" Artie yelled joyously, just as I completed the last item,\n\"Look at that, will you?!\"\n\nI looked, and had my first presentiment of disaster. At two feet, the\nmachine was busily fabricating--out of the air molecules themselves, for\nall I knew--_two_ bowls, _two_ spoons, and _two_ bowlfuls of cereal.\n\n\"Hey, Artie--\" I began, but he was too busy figuring out this latest\ndevelopment.\n\n\"It's the altimeter,\" he said. \"We had it gauged by the foot, but it's\ntaking the numerical calibrations as a kind of output-quota, instead!\"\n\n\"Look, Artie,\" I interrupted, as twin napkins and toothpicks dropped\ndown beside the new bowls on the table where the scale lay. \"We're going\nto have a little problem--\"\n\n\"You're telling _me_!\" he sighed, unhappily. \"All those damned _random_\nfactors! How many times did the machine have to be repaired after each\nfaulty test! What thickness of ceramics, or fabric, or rubber, or metal\nremained! What was the precise distribution and dampness of each of\nthose soggy cornflakes! Hell, Burt, we may be _forever_ trying to make a\nduplicate of this!\"\n\n\"Artie--\" I said, as three toothpick-napkin combinations joined the\nshattered remains of triple bowl-cereal-spoon disasters from the\none-yard mark over the scale, \"that is _not_ the problem I had in mind.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" he said, as four shimmering discs began to coalesce and shape\nthemselves. \"What, then?\"\n\n\"It's not that I don't appreciate the side-effect benefits of free\ncornflake dinners,\" I said, speaking carefully and somberly, to hold\nhis attention. \"But isn't it going to put a crimp in our anti-gravity\nmachine sales? Even at a mere mile in height, it means that the spot\nbeneath it is due for a deluge of five-thousand-two-hundred-eighty bowls\nof cornflakes. Not to mention all those toothpicks, napkins and spoons!\"\n\nArtie's face went grave. \"Not to mention the\nfive-thousand-two-hundred-seventy-nine of the same that the spot beneath\nwould get from the gadget when it was just one foot _short_ of the mile!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, calculating rapidly as the five-foot mark produced\na neat quintet of everything, a quintet which crashed noisily onto the\nten lookalikes below it as the machine bobbed silently to the six-foot\nmark, \"we have one interesting thing in our favor: the time element.\"\n\n\"How so?\" said Artie, craning over my shoulder to try and read my lousy\ncalligraphics on the pad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" I said, pointing to each notation in turn, \"the first batch,\nbowl-to-toothpick, took twenty seconds, if we include the time-lapse\nwhile the machine was ascending to the one-foot mark.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" he nodded. \"I see. So?\"\n\n\"So the second batch took double. Forty seconds. Not only did it require\nthirty-six seconds for the formation of the stuff, it took the machine\ntwice as many seconds to reach the two-foot mark.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" he said. \"So I suppose it took three times the base number\nfor the third batch?\"\n\n\"Right. A full minute. And the materialization of the objects is--Boy,\nthat's noisy!\" I interrupted myself as batch number six came smashing\ndown. \"--always at a point where the objects fit into a theoretical\nconical section below the machine.\"\n\n\"How's that again?\" said Artie.\n\n\"Well, bowl number one formed just below the exhaust vent of the central\ncylinder. Bowls two and three, or--if you prefer--bowl-batch two,\nformed about six inches lower, edge to edge, at the cross-section of an\nimaginary cone (whose rather truncated apex is the exhaust vent) that\nseems to form a vertical angle of thirty degrees.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" said Artie, \"each new formation comes in a spot\nbeneath this cone where it's possible for the new formations to\nmaterialize side-by-side, right?\" When I nodded, he said, \"Fine. But so\nwhat?\"\n\n\"It means that each new materialization occurs at a steadily increasing\nheight, but one which--\" I calculated briefly on the pad \"--is never\ngreater than two-thirds the height of the machine itself.\"\n\nArtie looked blank. \"Thank you very kindly for the math lesson,\" he said\nfinally, \"but I still don't see what you are driving at, Burt. How does\nthis present a problem?\"\n\nI pointed toward the un-repaired hole in the lab ceiling, where the\nmachine, after dutifully disgorging the number-seven load, was slowly\nheading. \"It means that unless we grab that thing before it gets too\nmuch higher, the whole damn planet'll be up to its ears in cornflakes.\nAnd the one-third machine-height gap between artifacts and machine means\nthat we can't even use the mounding products to climb on and get it.\nWe'd always be too low, and an _increasing_ too-low at that!\"\n\n\"Are you trying to say, in your roundabout mathematical way, let's grab\nthat thing, fast?\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said, glad I had gotten through to him. \"I would've said as\nmuch sooner, only you never listen until somebody supplies you with all\nthe pertinent data on a crisis first.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLoad number nine banged and splintered down into the lab, bringing the\ncumulative total of bowl-cereal-spoon-napkin-toothpick debris up to\nforty-five.\n\n\"Come on, Burt,\" said Artie. \"We'll have to get to the roof of the lab.\nThere's a ladder up at the--\"\n\nHe'd been going to say \"house\", but realized that there wasn't a house\nanymore. \"Quick!\" he rasped, anxiously. \"We can still get there by--\" He\nstopped before saying \"helicopter\", for similar reasons.\n\n\"Burt--\" he said, after a pause that allowed the total to rise to\nfifty-five with a crash. \"What'll we _do_?\"\n\n\"As usual with your inventions,\" I said, \"we get on the phone and alert\nthe government.\"\n\n\"The phone,\" said Burt, his face grey, \"was in the house.\"\n\nI felt the hue of my face match his, then. \"The car,\" I blurted. \"We'll\nhave to drive someplace where there's a phone!\"\n\nWe ran out of the lab, dodged a few flying shards of pottery that\nsprayed out after us from load-eleven-total-sixty-six, and roared off\ndown the road in Artie's roadster. He did the driving, I kept my eyes on\nmy watch, timing the arrivals of each new load. (Formula: _n \u00d7 20 = lag\nbetween loads in seconds_.)\n\nBy the time Artie discovered we were out of gas in the middle of a\ndeserted country road, load number twenty had fallen.\n\nBy the time we arrived on foot at the nearest farmhouse, and were\nordered off the property by the irate farmer who still had bare boards\non his windowless house, and a shotgun in his gnarled brown hands, load\ntwenty-five had fallen.\n\nBy the time we hitchhiked into town and got on the phone in time to find\nall the governmental agencies had closed their offices for the day, load\nthirty had fallen.\n\nBy the time we finally convinced the Washington Operator that this\nwas a national emergency that could _not_ (though she kept suggesting\nit) be handled by the ordinary Civil Defense members (the town had a\npopulation of two hundred, and a one-percent enrollment in CD. Those\ntwo guys wouldn't be any more help than we were, ourselves.), and were\nable to locate Artie's congressional contact (he was out at a movie),\nload fifty had dropped, and I was bone-tired, and it was (since load\nfifty took a thousand seconds to form, load one had taken twenty, and\ntheir total--one thousand twenty seconds--divided by two made an\naverage formulation-time of five hundred ten seconds per formulation)\nover seven hours since that first bowl had started to appear, and my\nmind, whether I wanted it to or not, gave me the distressing information\nthat by now Artie's estate was cluttered with a numbing totality of\none-thousand-two-hundred-seventy-five bowl-cereal-spoon-napkin-toothpick\nsets. And fifty-one more due in seventeen minutes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's he say?\" I asked Artie, leaning into the phone booth.\n\n\"He thinks I'm drunk!\" Artie groaned, slamming down the receiver. \"I\nonly wish I were!\"\n\nI gave a stoical shrug, and pointed to the bright red neon lure across\nthe street. \"Don't just stand there wishing. Join me?\" I started across\ntoward the bar.\n\n\"But Burt--\" Artie babbled, hurrying along beside me. \"We can't just\n_forget_ about it....\"\n\n\"We did our bit,\" I said. \"You told your contact, right? Well, by\ntomorrow morning, when the total is up to over three thousand (I\ncalculated five-thousand-fifty sets by the time the machine reaches the\nhundred-foot mark, a little better than twenty-eight hours from the\nstarting time), somebody's sure to notice all the birds in the region,\nif only an ornithologist, and--\"\n\n\"Birds?\"\n\n\"Eating the cornflakes,\" I said, and when he nodded in comprehension,\nwent on, \"--pretty soon the word'll get to the government.\"\n\n\"Or,\" said Artie, hopefully, \"the batteries and engine'll wear out....\nWon't they?\"\n\n\"It's a radium-powered motor,\" I said, as we slipped into the coolness\nof a booth at the rear of the bar. \"The power-source will deplete itself\nby half in about six hundred years, maybe. Meantime, what'll we do with\nall those cornflakes?\"\n\nThe waiter came by and we ordered two beers.\n\n\"Wait--\" said Artie, gripping my sleeve. \"As the machine reaches the\nupper atmosphere, the soundwaves'll thin out, weaken, as the medium\ngrows scarce.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, prying my cuff free of his fingers, \"so we only get\nbombarded with _badly made_ artifacts by the time the thing gets ten\nmiles up. But that's about fifty-thousand artifacts per foot rise,\nArtie, at that height! No, I take that back. Fifty thousand _sets_! And\nat five items per set (if we don't count the precise number of flakes\nper batch of cereal), we have twenty-five thousand items per foot per\nbatch, merely a _rough_ estimate!\"\n\nThe beers came, and we ordered two more, the orders to keep coming until\nwe said whoa.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You know,\" said Artie, after draining half the bottle, \"I just had a\nhorrible thought--\"\n\n\"Horrible above and beyond the _present_ horrors?\" I said, horrified.\n\nHe nodded, thoughtfully. \"What happens to anything that gets sucked into\nthe machine under the lip of the reflector? Does the machine just use it\nas more raw material ... Or does it start duplicating _that_?\"\n\n\"Holy hell!\" I choked. \"As if there weren't too many pigeons already!\"\n\n\"There's no room for a pigeon to fit under that lip,\" said Artie,\npatting the back of my hand as though he thought it was soothing me (it\nwasn't), \"or any other bird, for that matter. What I was thinking of was\nstuff like nits and gnats and mosquitoes and--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" I shuddered, reaching for my beer and finding the bottle empty.\nI looked for the waiter, but he was at the front window, watching\na crowd that was gathering in the street. They were looking in the\ndirection of the lab. It was a few miles away, of course, but that\nmachine was--if on time, and why shouldn't it be?--due to deliver\nfifty-two sets just about now, and even a few miles away, fifty-two\nbowl-spoon-napkin-toothpick-cereal combinations, shimmering in the air\nas they took form, would be hard to miss if you were looking in the\nright direction. I said as much to Artie, but he shook his head.\n\n\"It's ten o'clock of a moonless night, Burt. They couldn't see a damned\nthing, unless there were some kind of illumination--\" I saw by his face\nthat he'd thought of a possible source.\n\n\"What?\" I said.\n\n\"Fireflies?\" he hypothesized weakly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe got out of the booth and joined our waiter as he hurried out into the\nstreet. And there, in the distant blackness of the skies, was a sight\nlike a Fourth of July celebration gone berserk. From the number of those\nfireflies, I figure the first one got sucked in at about the fifteen\nmark, and possibly a few of his pals with him.\n\n\"Despite everything--\" said Artie, softly, \"it sure is beautiful.\"\n\n\"A gorgeous sight,\" I had to agree. \"But--What the hell is that thing in\nthe air under the fireflies? You can just make it out in the reflected\nflashes. It kind of looks like the--the _lab_....\"\n\nArtie's fingers sank into my forearm. \"But. It _is_ the lab! Not _the_\nlab, but another like it! With all those falling bowls and things,\nenough plaster-dust and wood-splinters and glass-spicules must've been\nsucked in to let the machine make a dupl--_There it goes!_\"\n\nA one-story building dropping from a height of around thirty feet onto\nanother one-story building covered over with spoons, crunchy cereal,\nand broken pottery makes much more racket than can be absorbed by the\ncushioning effect of thousands of napkins and rubber toothpicks. We were\na few miles off, so the sound--when it finally got to us--was muted by\ndistance, but it was still a lulu.\n\n\"And to think,\" Artie murmured, \"that this is happening because we tried\nto make it _noiseless_!\"\n\n\"What I'm worried about,\" I said sickly, \"is that new cloud of dust\nrising from the latest debris. There are crumbs of _two_ smashed\nbuildings in it, Artie. And in roughly twenty minutes the process is\ngoing to repeat, and there'll be crumbs from _four_ labs in the air; two\nlabs that'll be the second duplicate of the original, and two that'll be\nthe first duplicate of the original-plus-first-duplicate!\"\n\nArtie shook his head sadly. \"Crumbs from _six_, Burt. Remember, when\nthose four new labs fall in twenty minutes, they're going to raise dust\nfrom the wreckage of the two _already_ on the ground!\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said, less lackadaisically than I'd spoken when we left the\nphone booth for the bar, \"you'd better get your man in Washington,\nagain.\"\n\n\"He'll never believe I'm sober, _now_!\" Artie complained.\n\n\"Oops--Never mind, Artie,\" I said, resignedly, looking at the latest\ndevelopment in the distant sky. \"He'll get the word indirectly, from the\nforest rangers.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" said Artie, and looked toward the machine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmid the sparking cloud of fireflies, fluttering cornflakes, glinting\nspoons, and a foursome of hazy, still-processing new labs, there was a\nnewcomer to the chaos. Something in one of the plunging artifacts must\nhave rubbed something else the wrong way, made a spark, and--Well, the\nmachine was complacently sucking in raw blazing energy, now, tongue upon\ntongue of orange flame and black, spiralling smoke that rose from the\npyre of shattered synthetics. It was the first geometrically cone-shaped\nblaze I'd ever seen in my life, but that suction was going pretty good,\nnow. And all that glaring heat was going to be suddenly re-created going\nin the _other_ direction in about twenty minutes. But--\n\n\"Flames go _up_,\" said Artie, his thought-processes apparently running\nparallel to mine. \"So the new fires....\"\n\n\"Will be sucked in with the next batch,\" I finished. \"And come out\ndouble-strength next time around.\"\n\n\"Burt--\" said Artie, \"What's the temperature at which water breaks down\ninto free hydrogen and oxygen again?\"\n\n\"A little less than the melting point of iron,\" I said. \"Figure about\nfifteen hundred degrees Centigrade. Why?\"\n\n\"I just wondered if perhaps the machine might not only double the amount\nof the fire, but its temperature as well....\"\n\nI didn't _want_ to theorize about _that_. It was summer, and the air\nwas pretty humid, and that meant an awful lot of free hydrogen and\noxygen, all at once, ready to re-combine explosively in the heat from\nthe flames that had separated them in the first place, thence to become\ndisrupted again, thence to explode again.... The mind refuses certain\ncontemplations. I turned away from the chaotic display in the distant\nskies, and said to Artie, \"How's chances of the _machine_ getting melted\ndown?\"\n\nHe shook his head with great sadness. \"We made it out of damn near\nheat-proof metals, remember? So it wouldn't burn up at entry speeds from\nouter space?\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah,\" I said. \"So what'll we do, now?\"\n\nHe glanced at the increasing holocaust on the horizon. \"Pray for rain?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, that was yesterday. Today, as I write this, the government has\nfinally gotten wind of the thing, and the area is under martial law. Not\nthat all those uniformed men standing just out of heat-range about the\never-increasing perimeter are going to be of much help. Maybe to keep\nthe crowds back, they'd help, except no one in his right mind is heading\nany direction but away from the mound. A few trees went up in smoke\nduring the blaze, too, and now, every _n_-times-twenty seconds, a whole\nuprooted forest is joining the crash.\n\nNo one knows quite what to do about it. The best weapon we possess is\nArtie's inadvertent disintegrator pistol (remember Venus?), and ever\nsince the Three Day War, they've been banned. There's a proposition up\nbefore Congress to un-ban the things and blast the machine, of course,\nbut the opposition keeps putting the kibosh on things by simply asking,\n\"What if the machine doesn't vanish? And what if, during the attempted\nshooting, it starts duplicating disintegrator-beams?\"\n\nThe vote was negative.\n\nWe figure it'll take quite a few years before the machine gets\nbeyond the point where the atmosphere stops acting as a medium for\nthe soundwaves. And that, of course, is only if the machine isn't\nduplicating the atmosphere, too. And why couldn't it be?\n\nIn the meantime, the avian population in the region is on the increase,\nthanks to all those cornflakes-and-firefly dinners. Not to mention the\nbirds the machine has started to produce since a few foolish sparrows\ngot incinerated in the blaze.\n\nArtie figures that if enough snow falls on the machine, it may weight\nit down and stop the process. So far, that's the only hope we have.\nMeantime, it's still the middle of June.\n\nIt looks like a long summer.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Double or Nothing, by Jack Sharkey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOUBLE OR NOTHING ***\n\n***** This file should be named 43041-8.txt or 43041-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/3/0/4/43041/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
