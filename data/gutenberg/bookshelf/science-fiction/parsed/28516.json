April 12, 1264 / 4th day of Jumada, A.H. 662_\n\nFeverish, his arrow-wounded leg throbbing, Daoud ibn Abdallah lies in\nbed after a night of battle and defeat. As dawn lights the\neggshell-white windowpanes in his room, he recalls the events that led\nhim to this bitter hour.\n\nDaoud was born to an English crusading family that had settled in\nPalestine. Captured by Muslims as a child, he was taken to El Kahira,\nCairo, chief city of Egypt, and selected for the Mamelukes, the elite\ncorps of slave warriors gathered from all parts of the Middle East to\nserve the sultans of El Kahira.\n\nHe became a favorite of a leading Mameluke emir, Baibars. Young and in\nneed of comfort, he converted to Islam. He came to love the faith of\nMuhammad, totally and humbly dedicating himself to its tenets and to the\nwelfare of the Muslim people. He studied with Sheikh Saadi, a Sufi\nmystic, and with the Hashishiyya, the dreaded sect known in Europe as\nthe Assassins.\n\nIn those years the Tartars, invincible legions of mounted barbarians,\nhad come out of Asia, invading the Islamic world. A huge army led by\nHulagu, grandson of the Tartar conqueror, Genghis Khan, had already\nconquered Persia and Syria and was poised to attack Egypt. And Hulagu\nwas sending ambassadors to the pope to urge Christian Europe to join\nwith the Tartars in destroying the Muslims.\n\nShould Tartars and crusaders strike at Egypt simultaneously, the people\nand faith Daoud has come to love would perish. Daoud has seen with his\nown eyes how the Tartars obliterated Baghdad, its 200,000 men, women,\nand children slaughtered to the last soul, the city leveled, a\nwasteland. He is determined that the same fate not befall his adopted El\nKahira.\n\nBaibars--having made himself Sultan of El Kahira--sent Daoud into the\nland of the infidel. Because Daoud is blond and gray-eyed, no one would\never suspect him to be a Saracen, as Christians call all Muslims.\n\nDaoud's mission was to go to the court of the pope and use every means\nnecessary--from intrigue and bribery to assassination and outright\nwar--to stop Christians and Tartars from forming an alliance against\nIslam.\n\nHe went first to Manfred, king of southern Italy and Sicily. King\nManfred's family, the imperial German house of Hohenstaufen, had been at\nwar with the popes for generations, and Manfred had among his subjects\nmany Sicilian Muslims. Manfred agreed to help Daoud. But to protect his\nown interests Manfred insisted that Daoud take with him Lorenzo Celino,\na middle-aged Sicilian warrior, and Sophia Karaiannides, a beautiful\nByzantine woman. Lorenzo brought along his huge, formidable dog, Scipio.\nJourneying northward, the three rescued Rachel, a Jewish girl, from\ntavern ruffians. Daoud agreed, with misgivings, to let her travel with\nthem.\n\nThe pope, threatened by political violence in Rome, had moved his\nresidence to Orvieto, a strongly walled town built on a huge flat-topped\nrock. Here, Cardinal Adelberto Ugolini, a Sicilian churchman who had\nlong been secretly sending information to Baibars, was horrified to find\nBaibars's agent on his doorstep expecting hospitality. But the cardinal\nreluctantly agreed to help.\n\nHulagu Khan's ambassadors to the pope, Christianized Tartars named John\nChagan and Philip Uzbek, arrived in Orvieto two weeks after Daoud. A\nyoung French nobleman, Count Simon de Gobignon, commanded their military\nescort. Daoud had arranged for garbage-throwing hecklers to mar the\nambassadors' procession. The arrogant Cardinal Paulus de Verceuil,\naccompanying the Tartars, was hit by excrement. He ordered the hired\nVenetian crossbowmen to fire into the crowd, killing two innocent\nbystanders.\n\nCalling himself David of Trebizond, a merchant from the eastern shore of\nthe Black Sea, Daoud appeared publicly for the first time at a council\nof Church leaders called by Pope Urban. He spoke from firsthand\nknowledge of the horrors committed by the Tartars. But Friar Mathieu\nd'Alcon, the Tartars' interpreter, testified that in his opinion the\nTartar empire was no longer a danger to Europe.\n\nThe Tartar ambassadors and their entourage were guests at the palace of\nOrvieto's most powerful family, the Monaldeschi. When Contessa Elvira di\nMonaldeschi gave a reception for the emissaries, Daoud drew them into\ndrunken gloating over their atrocities and boasting of their plans for\nworld conquest. Pope Urban and many other Church dignitaries were\nappalled listeners.\n\nWith Ugolini's help, Daoud was able to persuade the influential\nDominican philosopher Fra Tomasso d'Aquino to write and preach against\nthe alliance. But then, subjected to unknown pressures, Fra Tomasso\nsuddenly changed his position.\n\nDaoud now felt that he could do no more through intrigue. He had been in\ncontact with the Filippeschi, an Orvieto clan who were hereditary\nenemies of the Monaldeschi family. And through Lorenzo he had been\nquietly recruiting a company of bravos--armed adventurers. Offering the\nhelp of his mercenaries, he persuaded the Filippeschi to attack the\nMonaldeschi palace. With de Gobignon and the Tartars' other guards\ndiverted, he could enter the palace and kill the ambassadors.\n\nWhile the Filippeschi prepared for the attack, Daoud discovered that\nAndrea Sordello, one of his hired bravos, had been set to spy on him by\nSimon de Gobignon. In Tilia's brothel, Daoud subjected Sordello to a\nHashishiyya initiation, using drugs and women to make the spy his slave.\nHe implanted in Sordello's mind a command that if he should see a silver\nlocket that Daoud keeps on his person, he would immediately kill Simon\nde Gobignon. And henceforth Sordello was to give Simon only the\ninformation Daoud wanted him to have.\n\nAfter the initiation Daoud was troubled. He had been taught how to do\nthis, but had never done it before. Had he truly and completely\nsubjugated Sordello's soul?\n\nOn the night of the attack he was dismayed to discover the Monaldeschi\nready for a siege. But, garbed in black as a Hashishiyya fighter, Daoud\nwent ahead and slipped into the Monaldeschi palace.\n\nThe Tartars, with Simon de Gobignon, Friar Mathieu, and four guards,\nwere in the most secure room in the palace, the cellar pantry, where\ncostly spices from the East were kept behind a thick door with a strong\nlock.\n\nTrained by the Hashishiyya to use his senses other than sight to fight\nin the dark, Daoud forced his way into the spice pantry and put out the\nlantern. He struggled with Simon in pitch blackness and came close to\nkilling him. Swords thrust at him from all directions. He had the\nTartars' lives almost in his grasp, but de Gobignon was thwarting him.\nHe tried frantically to kill de Gobignon and was no more able to do it\nthan if the man were a djinn.\n\nThen the old priest escaped from the cellar and came back with a lighted\ncandle. Gripped by the terrible fear that he would be caught and\nexposed, Daoud raced up the cellar stairs. Despair almost killed him\nwhen he felt the searing pain of a Tartar arrow in his leg.\n\nHe felt terror when he saw the white-bearded friar on the stairs\nblocking his way, even though the old man held no weapon in his\noutstretched arms.\n\nHe had been about to stab the friar, who was too useful to the Tartars\nand the Christians to be allowed to live. But his arm could not move. It\nwas as if a powerful hand held it, and he seemed to hear a voice booming\nin his head, _You dare to murder a priest?_\n\nIn his dread he hesitated, but if he did not escape Sophia would die.\nThe moment of paralysis passed, and instead of killing Friar Mathieu, he\nthrust him aside, to fall from the banisterless stairs.\n\nAs he lies in bed the following morning in Ugolini's mansion, Daoud\nforces himself to think. He has extended himself to the limit of his\npowers and failed, but he must try again. He has to find a new plan,\nlest his faith and his people, his whole world, meet annihilation.\n\nIn a room near Daoud's, Sophia Karaiannides kneels before an icon of\nSaint Simon Stylites that she herself painted. She is thankful that\nDaoud escaped alive from the Monaldeschi palace. She is glad that Simon,\nwho coincidentally shares the name of her favorite saint, is alive, too.\nBut how much longer, she wonders, will she have to live here in the\nmidst of enemies with the fear of a hideous death as a spy and an enemy\nof the Church dogging her day and night?\n\nSophia was born in Constantinople during the years when it was ruled by\nFrench invaders. As a very young woman she had seen her parents and her\nlover slaughtered by rampaging French troops. She went on to serve the\nByzantine general Michael Paleologos, who drove out the French and\nbecame the Basileus, Emperor of Constantinople.\n\nMichael sent Sophia as a confidential envoy to his ally, Manfred, and\nshe and Manfred became lovers. But when the blond Saracen who called\nhimself David of Trebizond arrived at Manfred's court, Manfred told her\nshe must help David in his mission of preventing the Christian-Tartar\nalliance. Manfred hinted at danger to her if she stayed with him. Though\nheartbroken at being sent away by Manfred, Sophia accepted the\nundertaking because another French crusade might well lead to another\nFrench attack on \"the Polis,\" her beloved home city.\n\nWhen Rachel joined their party, Sophia, remembering her own orphan\ngirlhood, befriended her. But Daoud insisted, to protect the secrecy of\nthe mission, that after they arrived in Orvieto, Rachel be sent to the\nbrothel run by Tilia Caballo, Cardinal Ugolini's mistress.\n\nAfter a few months in Daoud's company, Sophia felt powerfully attracted\nto him. The Saracen admitted that he was likewise drawn to her, but\ninsisted that they deny any loving feelings, because he must use Sophia\nto corrupt and defeat the advocates of the Tartar-Christian alliance.\n\nAnd he did so at the Contessa di Monaldeschi's reception for the\nTartars, sending Sophia to lure Simon de Gobignon away from the great\nhall of the palace while he tempted the Tartars to discredit themselves.\nSophia and Simon went for a walk in the atrium, and in a dark corner she\nlet him kiss her.\n\nA month after the reception Simon and she had a clandestine tryst in her\nroom at Ugolini's. Though she was ready to take him to bed, Simon\ninsisted that they remain chaste, according to the customs of courtly\nlove, thereby endearing himself to her all the more.\n\nShe is surprised to realize that she has come to care deeply for the\nidealistic, innocent young Frenchman. But her feeling for the Saracen is\nstronger. More than once the ruthless things Daoud has done in pursuit\nof his mission have made her almost hate him. Even so, when Sophia is\nwith Daoud she feels a fire building in herself to match the fire she\nperceives behind those gray eyes.\n\nShe glances at an hourglass, sighs, and rises from where she has been\nkneeling before the saint's icon. It is time to prepare a fresh poultice\nfor Daoud's wound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorning at the Palazzo Monaldeschi. The dead are laid out and wept over,\nthe debris of the siege cleared away, repairs begun on the damaged\nwalls. Simon de Gobignon strips off his mail shirt, about to step into a\nhot bath. He is profoundly grateful to be alive and relieved that he\nsuccessfully protected the Tartar ambassadors from being murdered by the\nman in black. But relief turns to anguish each time he is reminded that\nhis friend and adviser, Friar Mathieu, has been cruelly hurt by his fall\nand may yet die.\n\nCount Charles d'Anjou, brother of King Louis of France, commissioned\nSimon to guard the Tartar ambassadors. King Louis wants to go on crusade\nto win back the Holy Land with the help of the Tartars. Pope Urban,\nhowever, is not interested in a crusade in the Middle East, but wants\nthe help of the French in wresting southern Italy and Sicily away from\nManfred von Hohenstaufen. He has offered Manfred's crown to Count\nCharles, but King Louis so far has not agreed to let his brother make\nthe attempt. So the two strongest leaders in Christendom are stalemated.\n\nSimon is desperately determined that the alliance of Tartars and\nChristians succeed. As he has confessed to Friar Mathieu, he bears a\ndouble dishonor. The world despises him as the son of Count Amalric de\nGobignon, whose treachery caused the disastrous defeat of his king and\nthe death of thousands of his comrades on crusade in Egypt fourteen\nyears earlier. But only Simon and his parents know that Simon is in\ntruth the offspring of an adulterous affair between his mother,\nNicolette de Gobignon, and the troubadour Roland de Vency. Ultimately\nRoland killed Amalric in a duel and Nicolette married him. And Simon,\nthough not Amalric's son, inherited the title and the domain of the\nCount de Gobignon. Simon has undertaken the task of guarding the Tartars\nas a way of restoring the honor of the name de Gobignon and proving to\nhimself his right to bear that name.\n\nThe cause of the alliance has met with many setbacks in Orvieto, and\nSimon suspects a secret enemy is behind them. But in recent months the\ninfluential Fra Tomasso became a vigorous supporter of the alliance. And\nSophia, Cardinal Ugolini's lovely niece from Sicily, responded favorably\nto Simon's attentions. Events seemed to be taking a turn for the better.\n\nBut then Sordello warned Simon that the Filippeschi were planning to\nattack the Monaldeschi palace. Preparing to defend his hostess, the\ncontessa, Simon insisted that the Tartars, despite their desire to\nfight, be kept safe in the spice pantry. Directing the defense of the\npalace from its tower, Simon suddenly sensed that the attack must be\nonly a diversion, that the Tartars were the real target of whoever was\nbehind the Filippeschi. He abruptly left the tower and rushed down to\nthe spice pantry.\n\nHe had barely gotten there when a man all in black forced his way in and\ndoused the lights. In darkness the stalker killed two of the Tartars'\nguards and almost strangled Simon.\n\nSimon fought off the killer long enough to give Friar Mathieu time to\nopen doors and let in light. One of the Tartars managed to wound the man\nin black with an arrow. The attacker threw Friar Mathieu from the stairs\nand vanished into the maze of rooms on the first floor of the palace.\n\nNow, Simon thinks as he eases himself into his bath, he has met the\nhidden enemy whose presence he felt ever since coming to Orvieto. Evil\nas Satan, powerful enough to throw an army against a fortified palace,\nsubtle enough to strike at victims no matter how well protected. A\nbeing of almost inhuman strength and skill. Cruel and pitiless, ready to\nmurder anyone who stands in his way.\n\nCertain as the judgment of God it is that Simon and the man in black\nwill fight again. This is war to the death.\n\n\n\n\n                               BOOK TWO\n\n                             THE HOLY WAR\n\n                       _Anno Domini 1264-1266\n                     Year of the Hegira 662-664_\n\n \"That which striketh!\n What is that which striketh?\n Ah, who will convey to thee what the Striking is?\"\n                                            --The Koran, Surah CI\n\n \"How many men have slept in happiness, unaware that sudden death was\n about to strike them?\"\n                                                    --Hulagu Khan\n\n\n\n\nXLV\n\n\nDaoud drifted in and out of consciousness for two days after the fight\nat the Monaldeschi palace. Sleeping was much better than being awake and\nremembering failure.\n\nIn dreams he rode once again with his khushdashiya, his brother\nMamelukes.\n\nA yellow silk banner rippled in the breeze before them, declaring, WAGE\nWAR UTTERLY ON THE IDOLATORS, AS THEY WAGE WAR UTTERLY ON YOU.\n\nDust clouds swirled around them as they thundered down upon a row of\nFrankish knights. From a distance Daoud sent bolt after bolt from his\ncompound bow whistling into the dark line of mail-clad men. He saw men\nclutch at their throats and topple from the saddle.\n\nScreaming, he charged into the midst of the Franks, whirling his saif\nover his head, his lance in his left hand. A knight galloped into his\npath, holding up a shield white as an eggshell, emblazoned with a red\ncross. Daoud brought the saif down, and the knight raised his shield to\nfend off the blow. That left the crusader momentarily blind, and Daoud\nthrust under the shield with his lance.\n\nThe lance went in as if the knight wore no mail. As the Frank fell\nbackward from his horse, Daoud saw that it was Simon de Gobignon.\n\nSophia's light touch on his shoulder woke Daoud. He was lying on his\nstomach. He propped himself up on his elbows and saw the glowing,\ndiamond-shaped windowpanes and the familiar white walls of his room on\nthe upper floor of Cardinal Ugolini's mansion. He turned his head to\nlook at Sophia. Her dark eyes comforted him.\n\n\"Time for your poultice,\" she said.\n\nHe tried to smile at her. \"And something to drink. My mouth tastes dry\nand foul.\"\n\n\"Wine?\"\n\n\"By the Archangel, no! The juice of oranges, and later kaviyeh.\"\n\nSophia laughed. \"Oranges? In April? You must be dreaming. Trees do not\nbear fruit all year round in this part of the world, David. Your bitter\nbeverage I can supply. But let me see to your wound first.\" She raised\nthe blanket that covered his body. He felt his skin grow hot from scalp\nto toes. She was gazing upon his nude body. He was glad he was lying on\nhis stomach rather than on his back.\n\nDid his nakedness mean anything to her? Among Christians, he knew, men\nand women often saw each other naked. Not only did women go through the\nstreets with their faces uncovered, but in warm weather the common folk,\nmen and women both, walked to the public baths with barely a bit of\ncloth wrapped around their loins. And all Christians slept naked. When\nSophia saw his body like this, was it just another unclothed body, like\nthe many she had doubtless seen in her lifetime? Did she feel any\nembarrassment? Or desire? As for himself, his sense of helplessness made\nhim feel only embarrassed, nothing more.\n\nHe turned his head again to look at her. She was intent on administering\nthe poultice, and that doubtless took her mind off his nakedness. She\nhad lifted off the old cloth, stained an ugly yellow-brown, and dropped\nit to the floor. He got a glimpse of the wound, a red slit about half a\nfinger's length with black knots of thread in it in the back of his\nright leg, halfway between knee and buttock. Gently she patted and\nstroked on the wound a paste made of ground rose petals, lime water, and\negg white, the Sufi remedy he had taught her to make.\n\nLorenzo had used his knife to open the hole made by the arrow so that he\nwould not tear Daoud's flesh pulling the barbed head out. While Lorenzo\nworked over him, Daoud drew upon Saadi's final teaching to him to defend\nhimself against the pain. In his mind he began to create the drug called\nSoma. He envisioned it as a bowl of glowing, silver-colored liquid, and\nhe believed it could form a capsule around any part of his body where\nthere was pain and wall it off from the rest of himself, at the same\ntime filling him with a feeling of well being.\n\n_Once you have experienced the effects of material drugs on your body\nand learned to master them_, Saadi said to him, _you have the knowledge\nyou need to create a drug of the mind, Soma. This is more powerful and\nmore reliable, and it will not harm your body in any way. Indeed, Soma\nwill make your body stronger. It will calm your mind, fill you with\npeace, sometimes give you visions. But if you should suddenly need all\nyour faculties, they are yours at once. The drug is gone in an instant._\n\nIt was Saadi's teaching that whatever a man could accomplish with\ndrugs, he could accomplish more effectively and reliably with his mind\nalone. A trained man could envision a drug that would serve any desired\npurpose. And thus a man could transcend the Hashishiyya reliance on\nadministered drugs.\n\nWhile he had drunk from the bowl of Soma and it had flooded through his\nbody, Daoud's fingers had gripped the little leather case hung around\nhis neck that contained the Sufi tawidh, the numerological invocation\nthat he believed would speed his healing. A river of blood had poured\nout of his leg when Lorenzo drew out the arrow, and he had fainted.\nSophia had stitched the wound with cotton thread that was now black with\ncongealed blood.\n\nNow Sophia laid a clean, folded linen cloth over the wound, used another\nstrip of linen to tie the poultice to his leg, and then pulled the\nblanket up over him. Their eyes had not met once during the time she was\ncaring for him. He found to his surprise that he had to know what she\nwas thinking and feeling.\n\nAs if sensing his need, she spoke. \"I have wanted to tell you, but you\nwere too sick to understand me. D'Ucello, the podesta, came here the\nnight of the uprising, looking for you and Lorenzo. As we planned, I\ntold him you had both gone to Perugia.\"\n\nDaoud's body went cold. He felt as if he were being stalked, and the\nhunter was closing in.\n\n\"Did he believe you?\" he asked.\n\nShe shrugged. \"He blustered some, but the cardinal ordered him off in\nthe end. I think he must have hoped to find you among the dead or\nwounded at the Monaldeschi palace.\"\n\nDaoud rolled over in bed, the wooden frame creaking, and the pain tore\nthrough his leg like the slash of a scimitar. He groaned through\nclenched teeth. Despite his ability to shield his mind from pain when it\ntook him unexpectedly like this, it could hurt like the torments of the\ndamned.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nHe gasped. \"Trying to get up. D'Ucello will be back, and he must not see\nme wounded.\" He tried to sit up, and she laid her hand, firm and cool,\non his forehead and pushed him back against the pillows.\n\n\"You are in more danger from fever than you are from d'Ucello,\" she\nsaid, letting her hand rest on his forehead.\n\n\"You will be surprised at how quickly the wound heals,\" he said,\ntouching the tawidh at his neck. \"As for fever, it is healthy. It burns\nout impurities.\" He laughed bitterly. \"I hope it is burning the\nstupidity out of me.\"\n\n\"You--stupid?\" She laughed.\n\nHe did not join her. It pleased him a little, in the midst of his\nanguish and self-disgust, to see that she thought well of him. But she\nwas wrong about him--and her life depended on him, and that thought made\nhim feel worse.\n\n\"De Gobignon was waiting for me. He knew I was coming for the Tartars.\nHe _knew_.\"\n\n\"How much could he have known?\" she asked. \"No one knew what your plans\nwere.\"\n\n\"Sophia, if de Gobignon had not been there, I would have been able to\nkill those two barbarian pigs easily. I did my best, with all my skill,\nall my training, all my experience, and it went for nothing.\"\n\nThat was a pain Soma would not shield him from, the pain of failure. It\nfelt like a mace blow to his chest every time he remembered the fight in\nthe blackness of the spice pantry.\n\nTo drive away the damnable memory of being routed by the Christians, he\nhad to concentrate on the present and the future.\n\n\"Send someone to fetch Sordello to me.\"\n\n\"You should be resting.\"\n\nHe laughed and touched her hand lightly. \"Resting! Our enemies are not\nresting.\" She sighed, but went.\n\nWhen Sordello entered Daoud's room, Lorenzo followed him closely, eyes\nboring into the back of the mercenary's skull. Sophia entered behind\nLorenzo.\n\nTrembling, Sordello knelt by Daoud's bed. \"I feared for you, Messer\nDavid. I am happy to see you looking so well.\"\n\nWould Sordello give up the pleasures of hashish and the promise of a\nparadise with beautiful women? What reward could Simon de Gobignon offer\nhim that could be more enticing?\n\n_Yet, I have always known that this man was a two-edged sword that could\nturn in my hand._\n\n\"The Monaldeschi were prepared for us,\" said Daoud. \"They were armed and\non their battlements when we came. Someone warned them.\"\n\n\"You do not suspect me, Messer David?\" Sordello, crouched on the floor\nby Daoud's bed, looked up slyly sideways at him. \"I would be a fool to\ninjure one who has been so great a benefactor to me.\"\n\nDaoud felt rage boil up inside him at Sordello's false abjectness. He\nglared at the old bravo and saw a faint tremor in his jaw.\n\nPropping himself up on one elbow, he leaned toward Sordello. \"Your\nfawning insults me. I think you lie.\"\n\nHatred briefly twisted Sordello's face. Then a knowing smile made it\neven uglier.\n\n\"Messer David, if I had told the Count de Gobignon what I know about\nyou, you would surely be dead by now.\"\n\nDaoud forced himself to his feet. The pain shot through him like a\nlightning bolt, but in his fury he ignored it. He bent down and seized\nSordello's throat with his right hand. He fell back sitting on the bed,\npulling the popeyed bravo toward him so that his good knee pressed into\nthe Sordello's chest.\n\nSomewhere, nearby, he heard Sophia cry out in protest, but he paid no\nattention.\n\n\"Confess that it was you, and I will kill you quickly,\" Daoud whispered.\n\"I have shown you paradise, and I can show you hell. If you do not give\nyourself up now, and I find out later that it was you, I will inflict\ntorments of mind and body on you beyond your imagining.\"\n\n\"David, stop, you will kill him!\" Sophia screamed. She gripped Daoud's\narm, digging her nails into his muscle.\n\nGradually Daoud released his hold on the corded throat. With his eyes\nalone, employing the Hashishiyya \"look that imprisons,\" he held Sordello\nfast. The bravo's eyes were bloodshot and red-rimmed.\n\nHe was glad Sophia had stopped him. She must have realized that he would\nregret it if he killed Sordello in a fit of rage. If Sordello had not\nbetrayed them, his false reports to Simon de Gobignon would still be\nuseful. And in any case his sudden disappearance immediately after the\nattack on the Monaldeschi palace would draw de Gobignon's attention.\n\n\"If it is not you, then there is another among us who told Simon de\nGobignon about my plans. If you want to save your life, you will find\nout who it is.\"\n\n\"I promise you, Messere.\" Sordello's voice was a hoarse croak. \"Whoever\nthe escremento is, I will deliver his life into your hands.\"\n\nSordello stood up, then turned to Sophia and bowed.\n\n\"Madonna,\" Sordello gasped. \"My eternal gratitude--\"\n\n\"Just get out,\" Sophia snapped.\n\nWas there a suggestion of a leer in Sordello's lumpy face as he stared\nat Sophia? But pain spread from the wound in Daoud's leg in great\nripples through him, and he lay back and concentrated on the Sufi\nexercise that detached him from his body.\n\nThe heavy oak door closed behind Sordello. They were all three silent\nfor a moment. Then Lorenzo jerked the door open and looked out into the\ncorridor. He nodded, indicating Sordello had truly gone.\n\n\"It might have been wiser to strangle him,\" said Lorenzo. \"He has all\nour lives in his hands.\"\n\nDaoud held up his hand. \"What he said was true. He could have delivered\nus to our enemies before the attack. I believe he is still in my power.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen alone with Sophia, Daoud lay back on his cushions. She stood\nlooking down at him, and he wondered if that was pity he saw in her\nface.\n\n\"You are in such pain,\" she said.\n\nHe shook his head. \"It is nothing.\"\n\n\"I do not mean the pain of the body.\"\n\nShe understood, then, what he was feeling. He smiled at her and shut his\neyes.\n\nShe sat in silence on the edge of the bed while he lay there, brooding.\nAgain he escaped into drowsiness. His mind drifted back to the sands of\nEgypt. He dreamed again of riding as a Mameluke.\n\nWhen he woke, a short time had passed, and Sophia was still sitting\nthere, gazing down at him.\n\nHints of a new plan began to come together in his mind. As fever purged\nhim of poison, it had brought him dreams of battle. Not of intrigues\nwith the priests and bishops around the pope. Not of ambushes in narrow\nstreets. Rather, open war.\n\nThat was the meaning of those dreams. Perhaps God Himself had sent them.\nHe was called upon to wage jihad against the enemies of Islam as a\nMameluke, on horseback, at the head of an army.\n\nHe held out his arm to Sophia. \"Help me up. You and Lorenzo and I must\nmeet with Ugolini.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater that morning, a heavy spring rain hammered on the windows of\nUgolini's cabinet. The storm had so darkened the room that the\ncardinal's servants had lit extra candles. Daoud, Lorenzo, and Sophia\nsat in a semicircle across from Ugolini's worktable.\n\nThe painted glass eyes of Ugolini's stuffed owl glared disapprovingly\ndown from the bookshelves at Daoud, who had a sense that the cardinal\nfelt as the owl looked. The skull on the table seemed to be laughing at\nhim.\n\nHe understood now what he had to do, but would the others, especially\nUgolini, go along with it? Over Ugolini's frantic protests he had\ninsisted on inciting the Filippeschi to attack the Palazzo Monaldeschi.\nThat attack having failed of its purpose, would the three of them still\naccept Daoud's authority? Ugolini, surely, would think that events had\nproved him right about the futility of the attack on the Monaldeschi.\nHow could he be won over to the idea of a wider war? _Make war utterly\non the idolaters_--that, he had decided, was the meaning of his dream.\n\n\"Manfred's supporters, the Ghibellini, must take the pope captive,\" he\nsaid. \"I know that you would prefer peace to war, but now that I have\ntried to kill the Tartars and failed, we do not have that choice.\" It\nwas best, he thought, to admit his failure openly before Ugolini threw\nit in his face.\n\nThe cardinal's eyes were almost as wide and as stark as the owl's. \"You\nwould plunge the whole of Italy into war?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Daoud, \"but that is what is going to happen. The one thing\nthat has kept the French out of Italy is the pope's refusal to give the\nChristian kings, especially the king of France, permission to ally\nthemselves with the Tartars. But now that Urban is ill, he may give King\nLouis what he wants. When the pope allows the alliance, Louis will give\nhis brother Charles permission to attack Manfred. It is not I who will\nplunge Italy into war. I am proposing only that we act before the French\ndo.\"\n\nUgolini shook his head. \"What do you mean, take the pope captive?\"\n\n\"The Papal States are surrounded by cities ruled by Manfred's Ghibellino\nsupporters. The nearest is Siena. With gold and with timely warnings\nabout the danger from the French, we can persuade Siena to move against\nthe pope.\" He held up his fist. \"And then we can make sure that the next\npope elected is favorable to Manfred. And through him, well disposed\ntoward peace with Islam.\"\n\nIt was the same sort of plan, Daoud thought, as inciting the Filippeschi\nagainst the Monaldeschi. But Lorenzo had already visited Siena and made\nsure that the Ghibellini of Siena, with Daoud's help, could raise a far\ngreater army than the pope could muster in Orvieto. This time he would\nsucceed.\n\n\"Impossible!\" Ugolini cried. \"No king can control the Papacy. The\nHohenstaufen have been trying to rule over the popes for centuries, and\nfor centuries they have failed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it takes a stranger to see that where the Hohenstaufen failed,\nthe French are about to succeed,\" said Daoud. \"France is now the\nstrongest kingdom in Europe. If Manfred does not get control of the pope\nand the cardinals, the next pope will be under the protection of the\nFrench, and will have to do whatever they want.\"\n\n\"Urban is a sick man,\" said Ugolini. \"There is not a cardinal who would\nrisk a wager that he will live to see the year 1265. He will not call\nfor the French to save him when he knows the angels are coming to get\nhim.\"\n\n\"No, there I must disagree with Your Eminence,\" said Lorenzo, lounging\nin a large chair facing Ugolini's table. \"Urban is a Frenchman, and he\nwill work to bring the French into Italy until the moment the angels\nknock at his door.\"\n\nSophia, who had been sitting quietly in an armless straight-back chair\nwith her hands folded in her lap, said, \"The pope will blame the\nGhibellini for the attack on the Monaldeschi. He will want help, and he\nwill ask it from the French even if it means Christians joining the\nTartars in a crusade the pope does not really want.\"\n\n\"Very shrewd,\" said Daoud with a smile in her direction. \"Except that\nthe pope had decided before the attack on the Monaldeschi to approve the\nalliance with the Tartars. As we know from his persuading Fra Tomasso to\nswitch sides. It was because the pope had clearly turned against us that\nI planned to kill the Tartars.\"\n\nDaoud was tired of sitting. Despite the pain in his leg, he used his\nstick to push himself to his feet and stepped out of the window recess.\nHe limped over to Ugolini's table.\n\n\"We must send Lorenzo to Siena with enough of our precious stones to\nraise an army big enough to overwhelm the papal soldiery and the Orvieto\nmilitia. It may take time to persuade the Sienese to act. It will take\nmore time to muster an army and march on Orvieto. We must begin as\nquickly as we can. With the pope in Ghibellino hands, with the\nGhibellini in a position to sway the outcome of the next papal election,\nwe may yet keep the French out of Italy.\"\n\nAnd that, he thought, would keep crusaders and Tartars out of the Dar\nal-Islam.\n\nUgolini's shrug spoke more of despair than of acquiescence. \"Certainly\nthe French will come if we do nothing. You are right about that. Do as\nyou will. It is a miracle we have survived this long.\"\n\nStrange, Daoud thought. Ugolini saw their mere survival as miraculous.\nTo Daoud, failure so far to put a final stop to the alliance of\nChristians and Tartars made him wonder whether God disapproved of him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce he accepted the fact that he had to go, Lorenzo had hoped the rain\nwould continue. Under its cover his leaving the city was less likely to\nbe noticed or impeded. But by mid-afternoon, the hour of None, when he\nwas packed and mounted, a spare horse trotting behind him, a bright,\nhot sun had come out, and the puddles in the narrow streets were turning\nto steam.\n\nAt the Porta Maggiore he stopped when he saw two clerks seated at tables\non either side of the gateway, one questioning each person entering the\ntown, the other examining those leaving. A dozen of the podesta's men in\nyellow and blue stood by to keep people in line. Each clerk consulted\nwhat appeared to be a list on a scroll and on another scroll wrote down\nthe names of those he questioned.\n\nOnly two days ago Sophia had told d'Ucello that David of Trebizond and\nhis man Giancarlo were in Perugia. Now, Lorenzo thought, those damned\nclerks were probably watching for their return. They could have been set\nat the gate the morning after the attack on the Monaldeschi palace.\n\nHe smiled ironically as he remembered how, last summer, he had sat as\nthese clerks did now, at the gateway to Lucera waiting to catch a\ncertain Saracen newly arrived from Egypt.\n\nNow, thought Lorenzo, if he tried to leave Orvieto he would not only be\nstopped and possibly arrested, he would be as good as telling the\npodesta that he and David had never been out of the town at all.\n\nLorenzo clenched his fists. He felt like a tuna caught in a net.\n\n_And if I stand here much longer staring they'll notice me and haul me\nin._\n\nHe quickly turned his horses away from the gate and headed back to\nUgolini's mansion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the beginning of the third Nocturn, Lorenzo, David, and a servant of\nUgolini's named Riccardo, whom they had chosen for his size and\nstrength, emerged from an alley near the north side of the city wall.\n\nDavid wore a hood pulled low over his face. He limped and walked with a\nstick. Lorenzo had advised against his being out in the street at all,\nbut David had answered that the watch did not know he was in Orvieto and\nwould not be looking for him.\n\nLorenzo was amazed at how rapidly David had gotten better. He had never\nseen a man walking only two days after taking a bad arrow wound in the\nleg. The Muslims who taught David the art of healing must be even better\nthan Jewish physicians.\n\nAs they walked, Lorenzo made David recite the names of half a dozen\nprominent Perugian merchants who were supporters of King Manfred. If the\npodesta were to question David about his whereabouts the night of the\nFilippeschi uprising, these men would bear witness that David and\nLorenzo had been in Perugia.\n\n\"If d'Ucello does question you, how will you explain that you are back\nin Orvieto without having been seen entering through the gate?\" Lorenzo\nasked him.\n\n\"I will tell him--with the greatest reluctance--that the line was very\nlong when I arrived and that I was in haste to enter, so I bribed the\nmen on duty to let me by. The more time passes before he discovers my\npresence in Orvieto, the more believable that will be.\"\n\n\"If he suspects you of anything, he will arrest you no matter how good a\nstory you tell him,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nDavid stopped walking and rested his hand on Lorenzo's shoulder. \"That\nis why you must go tonight, my friend. And come back quickly with an\narmy from Siena.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLorenzo had a pack over his shoulder and wore a long traveling cloak.\nRiccardo carried a coil of rope. Ahead of them was a small stone shed\nbuilt against the wall, beside one of the round guard towers.\n\nLorenzo was not particularly frightened by the ordeal ahead. He had done\nenough climbing in his younger days. But he was repelled by the thought\nthat through the large opening in the floor of the little house the\npeople of this quarter dumped, not only their garbage, but also the\ncontents of their chamber pots.\n\nThey went quietly to the door of the shed. There was a guard in the\ntower above them, though he would have no reason to watch the garbage\nchute.\n\nRiccardo put a meaty hand on the rough-hewn door. It gave without a\nstruggle. Not even locked, thought Lorenzo. He supposed the podesta, may\nhis ballocks wrinkle up like prunes, had not thought that anyone would\nchoose this ignominious way to escape from the city.\n\n\"Sophia told me to tell you she would miss you,\" David said.\n\n\"Kiss her for me,\" said Lorenzo.\n\n_Wonder if David has bedded Sophia yet._\n\nRiccardo filled the little room so that Lorenzo felt himself being\ncrowded to the edge of the chute.\n\n\"Hey! Riccardo! Push me down _after_ you have the rope around me.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Messere.\" The burly man tied the rope tightly around Lorenzo's\nwaist, just above the belt that held the jewels, and they both pulled\nhard on the knot to test it. Tying the knots in the dark, they had to be\ndoubly careful. Then Riccardo tied the other end of the rope around his\nown waist and donned heavy oxhide gloves.\n\nIt was a warm April night, and Lorenzo smelled a horrid odor of garbage\nand excrement coming up from the pit. It was not actually a pit, but a\ncrevice in the face of the cliff on which Orvieto was built. Lorenzo had\nhoped the day's heavy rain would have washed the cliffside clean. But\nthe people of Orvieto had been dumping offal here for centuries.\n\n\"Your final instructions?\" he said to David.\n\n\"Ugolini's servant Guglielmo seems to have gotten safely out of the city\nwith your horses and baggage,\" said David. \"He must not have been on any\nlist. He will meet you at the shrine of Saint Sebastian on the road to\nSiena. From there you know what you have to do.\"\n\nDavid grasped him by the shoulders and then patted his back. They had\nbecome good friends, Lorenzo realized. Look how David was trusting him\nto ride with a fortune in gems to Siena, meet the right parties, bargain\nwith them, deliver the gems to them and come back to Orvieto with a\nGhibellino army. That was much to expect of a man. Yet David seemed not\nto doubt that Lorenzo would do it.\n\nLorenzo felt warm when he thought how much David meant to him. He had\ncome on this mission as King Manfred's man, but he was going to Siena\njust as much for David as for Manfred. Bringing the Sienese into the\nstruggle might keep the French away, though, and that would help Manfred\nas much as it would the Muslims.\n\n\"Lower away, then,\" Lorenzo said to Riccardo.\n\nDavid stepped back. Riccardo and Lorenzo both took hold of the rope.\nLorenzo stepped over the edge of the chute. His legs dangled, and he\ntried not to think about how much empty space was between him and the\nrocks at the base of Orvieto's mountain. The rope cut painfully into his\nwaist and back. He gripped it tightly with his gloved hands and wrapped\nhis legs around it to take some of the strain off the loop around his\nwaist.\n\nGrunting, Riccardo slowly lowered Lorenzo through the chute. David was\nstanding beside Ugolini's man and had laid a protective hand on the\nrope. The hole in the floor was just wide enough for Lorenzo's shoulders\nto pass through. Then he was hanging free below the city wall, his back\nto the cliff, staring out at a starry black sky and the silhouettes of\ndistant hillsides. He felt dizzy and shut his eyes.\n\n\"Turn me,\" he whispered hoarsely up at the opening above him.\n\nAfter a moment he felt his body rotating, and again he had to fight\ndizziness. He was facing in toward the smelly crevice, and he drew up\nhis legs and planted his feet firmly on its walls. With the help of the\nrope he could walk down the cliffside. Riccardo let out the rope a\nlittle more, and Lorenzo's boot sole scraped loudly against the\ncrumbling tufa surface, releasing a shower of pebbles.\n\n\"Who's down there?\" a distant voice shouted, and Lorenzo felt as if\nsomeone had dumped a bucket of cold water over him. That was the guard\nin the tower high above. He wondered if the guard could see him down\nhere. He tried to grip the sides of the crevice with his feet and pull\nhimself closer to the cliff face.\n\n\"I am taking a piss, buon'amico!\" Riccardo called up to the guard. \"Do\nyou mind?\"\n\n\"That place is not for pissing,\" the guard called back.\n\n\"Would you rather I sprinkled your tower?\"\n\nThere was no answer this time, and Riccardo began whistling loudly to\ncover any further noises Lorenzo might make. Lorenzo hoped the guard\nwould not come down to investigate. What if he did, and Riccardo felt he\nmust let go of the rope?\n\nRiccardo must have had the same thought, because he began paying out the\nrope more rapidly, and Lorenzo's feet flew over the crackling rock. He\nwas like a man running furiously backward. It would be comical, he\nthought, were he not in danger of breaking his neck.\n\nThis was a time when he wished he had clung to a religion of some sort\nrather than abandoning the faith of his fathers and replacing it with\nnothing. It would be so comforting to pray to an all-powerful being who\nmight be kind enough to protect him. Just _hoping_ not to get hurt\nseemed stupid and futile.\n\nHe felt the cliff wall beginning to slant outward a bit under his feet.\nThe whistling from the shed had stopped. He looked up and saw that he\nwas halfway down the side of the cliff. The backs of his legs ached from\nthe strain of supporting his weight, and his shoulders and arms hurt\ntoo. He began to worry, not so much about whether he would fall as what\nhe might land in when he reached the bottom.\n\nAnd the smell of rot and filth all around him might choke him before he\never got down. He saw directly below him a pit of blackness surrounded\nby trees that were only a little less dark. The muck might be over his\nhead; he might just sink into it.\n\nAs he reached the level of the trees he drew his knees up and then\nstraightened them hard, giving himself a push away from the cliff. He\nwas still being lowered, so that when he swung back to the cliff he was\nmuch farther down. This time his boots hit a coating of soft stuff on\nthe rock, and the smell was unbearable.\n\n_I'd rather break my neck than smother in shit._\n\nHe kicked again with his legs, and when he hit the end of the outward\nswing, the rope feeling as if it would cut him in two, he grabbed for a\ntree branch, barely visible in the darkness. It hit him in the stomach\nand knocked all the wind out of him, but he clung to it desperately.\n\nBent double over the tree limb, he looked down and saw shadows that\nmight be forest floor as far below him as his own height. Then again, he\nmight be seeing the tops of other trees. He drew his dagger and cut the\nrope around his middle but held it with one hand. He took deep, relieved\nbreaths when the constraint was gone. He gave three sharp jerks on the\nrope, the signal that he was down. After a moment all tension left the\nrope, and he felt it falling in the darkness. Another moment and he\nheard rustlings, thumps, and splashes as the rope landed at the bottom\nof the crevice. Tomorrow's dumping, he thought, would quite conceal it.\n\nHe wondered briefly if David and Riccardo had safely left the dumping\nshed and were on their way back to Ugolini's. He looked down again into\nthe darkness, realizing that if he jumped from here he might fall far\nenough to kill himself. Having swung away from the pile of offal, he was\nnow more worried about breaking his neck. He pulled himself up,\nstraddling the tree and facing in toward the trunk. He slid down to the\ntrunk, then tried to feel about with his foot for another branch.\n\nHis feet met nothing. He swung over the side of the branch, feeling the\ntrunk with one hand and the space below him with his feet. Still\nnothing. Now he was dangling from the limb, holding on with two aching\nhands. If he had not worn gloves, he would have no skin left on his\npalms.\n\n_Well, here goes one hopeful atheist._ He let go.\n\nHe fell a short distance, feetfirst, into a pool of water. It came up\nover his low boots, soaking his hose. There was no smell; apparently it\nwas a pure forest pool, probably a puddle enlarged by the recent rain.\nSighing, he sloshed out of it. Small creatures hopped and scurried away\nfrom him.\n\n_It could have been much, much worse._\n\nGlad to feel his feet on the ground, he hoped the rest of his journey to\nSiena would be less exciting than the beginning.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI\n\n\nFriar Mathieu sat in a cushion-lined armchair in the cloistered garden\nof the Hospital of Santa Clara, the white wisps of his beard ruffling\nlike feathers in the morning breeze. The dappled shade of a pear tree\nprotected him from the June sun.\n\nA young Franciscan, his tonsured head a gleaming pink spot surrounded by\na wreath of close-cropped black hair, stood at a tall desk beside Friar\nMathieu, writing on a piece of parchment.\n\n\"All things lead to good if one looks at them aright,\" Friar Mathieu\nsaid with a chuckle. \"That murderer in black gave me the time I needed\nto do something needful--get the story of my journey among the Tartars\nwritten before it is lost in my failing memory. A good thing I did not\nland on my head.\"\n\nDespite the pain he felt at Friar Mathieu's injuries, Simon had to smile\nat the old Franciscan's little joke. And indeed, he might look small and\nfragile huddled in his chair, but he was showing energy and zest for\nlife. He was pulling through.\n\n\"And behold,\" Friar Mathieu went on, lifting his bandaged right arm, \"I\nmyself am exempted from writing. Friar Giuseppe must do the work while I\nsit here and explore my memory. And when I grow tired of even that\nlittle bit of work, Friar Giuseppe reads to me from the newly arrived\nmanuscript on mathematics, called _De Computo Naturali_, by our gifted\nbrother Friar Bacon of Oxford. I could almost be grateful to that\nAssassin.\"\n\nSimon stood awkwardly, looking unhappily down at him, till Friar Mathieu\nmotioned him to sit on the ground beside him. To make room for himself,\nSimon moved a pair of crutches out of the way. It was worrisome that so\nsoon--only a few weeks after the fall that had almost killed him--Friar\nMathieu had started hobbling about on crutches and had begun dictating,\nsitting painfully upright, to Friar Giuseppe. Even though one leg was\ncertainly broken and there were probably a dozen other cracks in his\narms and ribs, Friar Mathieu insisted that he was more likely to die if\nhe remained in bed than if he was up and moving about.\n\n\"You are looking well today, Father.\" He had to admit it, even though\nthe old priest was not taking proper care of himself.\n\n\"I am lucky this happened to me in the spring,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"The\nsun and air help me mend. But I fear you will not see my complete\nrecovery, since you will have to leave Orvieto shortly.\"\n\n\"Leave? Why, Father? Has something gone wrong?\" His first thought, as\nalways, was for the safety of the Tartars. Ever since that terrible\nnight in April, he dreaded leaving them out of his sight.\n\nInstead of answering, Friar Mathieu asked Friar Giuseppe for privacy.\nThe young priest bowed deeply and touched the old man's hand reverently\nbefore gathering up his writing materials and turning to go.\n\n\"You have not heard, then? A courier brought the news to the pope's\npalace last night. All through the north, the Ghibellini are on the\nmove. Siena, it seems, has been quietly raising an army to send against\nOrvieto. And the Ghibellino party has taken power in Pisa and Lucca. It\nappears the Ghibellini have decided to seize all of Italy before the\nFrench come in and take it.\"\n\n_But we are French_, thought Simon, _and we have no ambitions in Italy_.\n\n_Uncle Charles does._\n\nIn this quiet garden it was hard to believe that an army could be\npreparing to march against Orvieto. Or even that the attack on the\nPalazzo Monaldeschi had happened in the same city. Simon watched a friar\nin his brown robe serenely weeding. The rows of plants were already tall\nand thick--peas, haricots, lettuce, cabbage, carrots. At Gobignon this\ntime of year the seedlings would not be half as high.\n\n\"Will the Sienese besiege Orvieto?\" he asked.\n\n_Another battle? And another attempt on the Tartars?_\n\n\"Pope Urban will not wait to see what they do,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"He\nfeels threatened from both north and south, and intends to move away\nfrom here as soon as possible. There is a rumor that Manfred of Sicily\nhimself may invade the Papal States this summer.\"\n\nSimon sprang to his feet and threw his arms wide in astonishment. \"And\nwhat about the Tartars?\"\n\n\"They will certainly go where His Holiness goes.\"\n\n\"God's blood!\" Simon struck his forehead with his hand. \"Forgive me,\nFather. But if the pope has not enough troops to keep him safe in\nOrvieto, surely he is in even more danger on the road. And if the\nTartars are with him, we could lose everything.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu shook his head, absently rubbing his bound right arm with\nhis left hand. \"We can gain everything. His Holiness needs help\ndesperately. Now he can be persuaded to give King Louis permission to\njoin with the Tartars.\" The old Franciscan's eyes fixed on Simon's. \"You\nmust go to the pope.\"\n\nSimon felt the palms of his hands grow cold. \"The pope will not listen\nto me, Father.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu chuckled. \"Is he more likely to listen to that fool--God\nforgive me--de Verceuil?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Simon after a moment's thought. \"De Verceuil is a cardinal.\nAnd is it not his task to treat with the pope? Mine is to guard the\nambassadors.\"\n\n\"Are you not close to King Louis, Simon? Almost a foster son?\"\n\nSimon hesitated. \"That is putting it a bit strongly. But he knows me\nwell.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu gestured with his left hand. \"Then you are the person to\ncarry His Holiness's appeal for help to King Louis.\"\n\nThe suggestion dismayed Simon. It meant he would have to leave the\nTartars for months. And just when they would be much more vulnerable to\nattack, following the pope from one city to another.\n\n\"No, Father,\" he said. \"I cannot leave the Tartars.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu shook his head patiently. \"Do you not see, Simon? If the\npope does decide to approve an alliance with the Tartars, John and\nPhilip's work is done.\"\n\nStanding on the gravel walk of the Franciscan cloister garden, Simon\nfelt as if the earth were shaking under him. He could not picture\nhimself speaking to the pope as one statesman to another. Persuade the\npope suddenly to take a stand, when he had vacillated for nearly a year?\nAnd yet, he told himself, he was the Count de Gobignon, and the lands he\nheld were larger than some kingdoms.\n\nBut that only reminded him that he held the title through a lie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe courtyard before the papal palace was crowded with covered wagons\nand open carts, horses and donkeys, men carrying crates and bales. Here\nand there, mailed papal archers in gold and white surcoats strode,\ncrossbows on their shoulders, alert for pilfering. Simon asked a series\nof servants for the pope's majordomo and was directed to that official,\nclad in a glittering embroidered tunic, who stood at the center of the\npapal library overseeing the packing of books and scrolls. Simon\nsummoned up all his confidence and presented himself to the man.\n\n\"The Count de Gobignon of France?\" the horse-faced majordomo repeated.\n\"I will try to find His Holiness for you, Your Signory.\"\n\nThey found Pope Urban in a tiny chamber on the second floor of the\npalace, writing furiously at a desk that faced a window opposite the\ndoor. He was wearing a white cassock with a white linen hood drawn up\nover his head. On his desk Simon saw a jar of ink, a sheaf of quills,\nand a stack of parchment sheets. A wrought-iron stand held a black\nearthenware pitcher over a candle flame.\n\n\"Holy Father--\" the majordomo began, addressing the pope's back. Simon\nwatched with fascination the rapid movements of Pope Urban's right arm\nas his quill raced over the parchment, leaping after each line to the\nink jar and back again.\n\n\"Maledizione!\" the pope exclaimed. \"Not now, Ludovico. God's pity, let\nme get at least one letter done without you interrupting me. The\nArchangel Michael run you through if you speak another word to me.\"\n\nSimon was momentarily shocked, but then recalled that the pope was a\nshoemaker's son. Once a bourgeois, always a bourgeois, he thought, even\nif one becomes God's vicar on earth. But, by God's robe, the man could\nwrite fast. In a moment he had filled a sheet of parchment with the\nshort, unadorned black strokes of a chancery hand. Simon estimated it\nwould take him the better part of a morning to write that much. Of\ncourse Pope Urban, being a churchman all his life, had a good deal more\npractice at writing.\n\nUrban folded the parchment and poured melted red wax from the black\npitcher to seal it. He took the large gold ring from his finger and\nstamped it into the wax. Without looking around, he handed the letter to\nhis majordomo.\n\n\"To Duke Alberto Baglione at Perugia by our best horses,\" said Pope\nUrban. \"Have Pietro Pettorini carry it; he is our fastest man.\"\n\n\"Holiness,\" said the majordomo diffidently, taking the letter, \"the\nCount de Gobignon wishes to see you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Urban half turned in his chair to look at Simon. Simon saw that\nthe pope's wrinkled face was a deep pink, and his eyes glittered. Loose\nstrands of gray hair escaping from under his hood quivered as his head\nshook with a slight, constant tremor. Simon had heard that men sometimes\nrallied in the final stages of an illness, before the slide into\ndarkness. That, perhaps, accounted for the pope's color and energy.\nSimon's heart ached for the old man. This was the spiritual father of\nthe world, and his troubles, troubles Simon had in part brought to him,\nwere aiding whatever disease was destroying him.\n\n\"Simon de Gobignon!\" Urban cried, raising bony hands in benediction. \"If\nyou had not come to me, I should have sent for you.\" His pale blue eyes\nshifted from side to side, and Simon felt even more pain for him.\n\n_This man should not think of traveling. It will kill him._\n\nUrban half stood, and his majordomo rushed past Simon to turn his chair\nso that the pope could face his visitor. He was sitting in a simple\nstraight-back chair without arms.\n\nSimon stepped into the room and dropped to one knee. The pope extended\nhis trembling right hand, and Simon kissed his gold Fisherman's Ring. On\nits circular face was an engraving of a bearded man whom Simon guessed\nmust be Saint Peter, casting a net from the stern of a boat.\n\nSeen close at hand and without the tall tiara and the crozier and the\nheavy robes of office, Urban was very short. Simon wondered whether he\nhad always been a little man or whether age and the strains of his\noffice had shrunk him.\n\n\"Stand up, Monseigneur le Comte, s'il vous pla\u00eet,\" said the pope,\nchanging to French. \"I am sorry there is no chair, but this is where I\ndo all my real work, and it is best not to encourage visitors to sit.\nLudovico, leave us and shut the door behind you. And do not hang about\nin the corridor eavesdropping.\"\n\nSimon rose, and found himself looking down at the skullcap on top of the\npope's head. Feeling awkward, he took a few steps backward until his\nback was against the door of the tiny chamber.\n\nUrban said, \"I have long wanted to hear from your own lips what happened\nat the Palazzo Monaldeschi.\"\n\nSimon gave the pope a detailed account of the battle. He ended with his\nfight with the man in black. Urban's eyes widened, and the trembling of\nhis head grew more pronounced. When Simon told how the enemy had\nescaped, throwing Friar Mathieu from the cellar stairs, the pope winced\nin pain.\n\n\"So,\" Urban mused, \"this murderer--doubtless sent by Manfred von\nHohenstaufen--still lurks somewhere in Orvieto.\"\n\n\"We have tried to track him down,\" said Simon. \"But the Filippeschi deny\nany knowledge of him, and the podesta, it seems, has not the power to\nmake them answer our questions.\" He allowed the contempt he felt for\nd'Ucello to creep into his voice.\n\n\"Open the door and see if that sneaking Ludovico is listening outside,\"\nPope Urban said. His lips twitched under his flowing gray beard in what\nwas probably a smile.\n\nSimon went to the door, and saw no one in the corridor but a helmeted\nman-at-arms standing about ten paces away. Servants with a huge bed\nframe struggled past. He closed the door and turned again to the pope.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Urban. \"What was I saying? Ah, yes--Simon, I expect to be in\nmy grave before the year is out.\"\n\n\"God forbid, Your Holiness!\"\n\n\"God do me that kindness, you mean.\" Urban raised a deprecating hand. \"I\nam worn out. I am ready to go home. But I have a last task to do before\nI die. I must insure the destruction of the odious Manfred. I must not\nlet him kill me before my work is done, and I must not fall into the\nhands of the Ghibellini. So, though it will shorten my life even more, I\nmust leave Orvieto. Now that the Ghibellini have stirred up the\nFilippeschi to make civil war, I am no longer safe on this mountaintop.\nPerugia is more secure. It has a big army, and it is surrounded by a\nstrong ring of other Guelfo cities and castles. After I am gone, the\ncardinals will be safe there while they elect a new pope.\"\n\nSimon realized that he was indeed looking at a dying man. From here to\nPerugia was a journey of at least two weeks, through difficult,\nmountainous country. Urban might get there safely, but he would not live\nthere long. The election of a new pope would take months; it had been\nknown to take years. And Urban's successor might be even more reluctant\nto join forces with the Tartars than Urban had been. What if it were\nCardinal Ugolini--he was as eligible as anyone--or someone under his\ninfluence? The little they had accomplished so far might be wholly\nundone.\n\nTime. Time was the most terrible enemy of all. The more time passed, the\nless likely that the alliance would be formed, the joint attack on the\nSaracens launched. Simon saw time as a black river in flood, sweeping\naway everything he had worked and fought for.\n\n_I must prevail upon him to give his permission--now. But how can I sway\na man three times my age--the pope himself?_\n\nThe only way to keep from giving in to despair was to plunge in, as if\nthis were a tournament, or a fight to the death. Simon plunged in.\n\n\"Your Holiness, before you leave Orvieto, I beg you to recognize that we\nmust join with the Tartars to crush the infidel.\"\n\nUrban sighed. \"You think just as your King Louis does.\" He held up an\nadmonitory finger. \"Europe first, Simon. The Church must be strong in\nEurope before our princes go adventuring in Outremer.\"\n\n\"But it was the popes who preached the Crusades in the first place,\"\nSimon answered, baffled.\n\nUrban's eyes grew wide and he leaned forward. \"And I will preach yet\nanother crusade, Simon. Against Manfred the Antichrist. That is why I\nwould have sent for you if you had not come here. You must make the\njourney to King Louis and tell him that this crusade that I will preach\nis the most important war of his lifetime. He must come to my aid. I\nwill make his brother Charles king of southern Italy and Sicily. I will\nwrite the letter to King Louis, and you will carry it to him.\"\n\n_Now I must make my effort._\n\n\"He will heed your appeal if you give him what he wants, Your Holiness.\nWrite that letter. But in it give your permission for King Louis to ally\nhimself with the Tartars and begin preparations for a new crusade.\"\n\nUrban looked slyly up at Simon. \"Surely you suspect that it was I who\npersuaded Fra Tomasso d'Aquino to change his colors where the Tartars\nare concerned. I saw to it that the possibility of an alliance was kept\nalive, so that I might have something Louis and I could haggle over.\nLouis is the most stubborn man in the world. If I simply give him\nwhatever he wants, there is no guarantee that he will give me what I\nwant.\"\n\nSimon took a deep breath. What he was about to say might offend the pope\ndeeply.\n\n\"Your Holiness, you have said it yourself. There is no more time for\nhaggling. You must make your best offer and hope it is enough.\"\n\nThe pope shut his eyes and slumped in his chair. Simon's heart went\ncold, thinking for a moment that the old man had suffered a seizure.\n\nBut then Urban said very softly, \"Help me to turn my chair around.\"\n\nNow Simon's heart beat faster as he moved the pope's chair so that it\nfaced his desk. Urban took a gleaming blank sheet of parchment from the\npile on his desk, dipped a quill, shook it, and began to write.\n\nSimon stood by the wall, his heart pounding with exhilaration. Could it\nactually be that his words had moved the pope himself? It seemed\nimpossible, as if he had stood in the path of a mighty river and\ndiverted its course.\n\n\"The Tartars,\" the old man said with a sigh sometime later, when he had\ncovered two sheets of parchment. \"I hope I am not making a terrible\nmistake. I still think Fra Tomasso was right in what he first said about\nthem.\" He dropped wax at the bottom of the letter, stamped it with his\nring, and blew on the wax to cool it. Then he folded the parchment and\nsealed it again.\n\n\"Ride to King Louis as quickly as possible.\" Urban turned, again half\nrising from his chair, and handed Simon the letter.\n\n\"Shall I carry the king's answer to Perugia, Holy Father?\"\n\nUrban shrugged. \"Oh, yes, I shall surely be in Perugia by the time you\ncome back. But God will take me before the first of Charles d'Anjou's\nknights sets foot in Italy.\" He raised a pale hand to silence Simon's\npolite protest, and there was actually a twinkle in his eye. \"Whatever\nmy successor thinks, he will have a hard time undoing the decisions I\nhave made today. By the time the next pope is elected, he will have a\nFrench army to help him destroy the Hohenstaufen. Whether he wants to or\nnot.\"\n\n\"What of the Tartar ambassadors, Your Holiness?\" Simon asked, thinking\nthat it would be best to hasten those negotiations, too, lest the next\npope disapprove of them. \"Should I take them with me to the king?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Urban firmly. \"Then you would have to take a troop with you\nto guard them. You may have to travel far to find King Louis. He is\nsetting out on a royal progress through his kingdom. I had a report of\nhim just two days ago. That is one great benefit of this office--\" His\ngray beard twitched again, and Simon knew that he was smiling. \"News\ncomes to us from everywhere.\" Then his eyelids lowered. \"That is also\nwhat makes being the Holy Father so wearisome.\"\n\nYes, of course, King Louis made a journey of inspection through some\nportion of his realm nearly every summer. It might be months, Simon\nthought with a sinking heart, before he could find the king, deliver the\npope's letter, and get back to the papal court. So much could happen.\n\n_But the most important thing of all has already happened. We have won.\nWe have the alliance!_\n\nTriumph rang like cathedral bells in his ears. He was bringing victory\nto the king and to Count Charles. And his success would restore honor to\nthe house of Gobignon.\n\nSimon knelt once again, kissing the Fisherman's Ring and thinking that\nthe hand that wore it would soon be cold.\n\nBut as he hurried down a corridor in the Palazzo Papale, already\nplanning his route to France, the bells of triumph stopped ringing and\nin the silence a face appeared before his mind's eye. Amber eyes, olive\nskin, and wine-colored lips.\n\n_Sophia! By all the angels and saints, I may never see her again!_\n\nFor a moment he felt torn. Duty and honor demanded that he leave Orvieto\nat once. But what of love? Sophia's image smiled, and he decided. He\nwould need at least a day to prepare for his journey anyway. Before he\nleft Orvieto he must see Sophia and make sure that the meeting would not\nbe their last.\n\n\n\n\nXLVII\n\n\nFat gray clouds hung low over the Umbrian hills, and Sophia thought she\nheard thunder rumbling in the west. As Simon's message had promised, he\nwas waiting for her by the shrine of the Virgin on the road leading\nnorth from Orvieto. But what was he doing here, she wondered, with spare\nhorses and a loaded baggage mule?\n\nHe waved to her and dismounted, and his scudiero--the same man who had\nyesterday delivered Simon's note to her--took charge of the beasts.\n\nClearly Simon was beginning a journey. He had not simply come out here\nto meet her. But he would not go anywhere far with no more company than\none squire. And how could he leave the Tartars when hardly two months\nago he had nearly lost his life protecting them?\n\nTrying to puzzle out what was afoot, she rode with Ugolini's man\nRiccardo beside her to the shed-covered shrine where a blue-robed Mary\nheld a smiling baby Jesus. Riccardo helped her down from her horse and\nSimon came forward.\n\nShe took Simon's arm, and he led her into the pine forest beside the\nroad. She studied his face, trying to guess what thoughts were passing\nbehind his somber blue eyes.\n\nAs soon as they were out of sight of their companions, she asked him,\n\"Are you going to Perugia ahead of the pope?\"\n\nHe did not answer her at once, so she kept her gaze on him.\n\nSophia enjoyed looking at Simon as she enjoyed looking at beautiful\nicons, jewels, sculptures. Yet his body did not have the fine\nproportions she had seen in statues made by Greeks of old. He was very\ntall and slender, all sharp lines pointing to heaven. His head, framed\nby long dark brown hair, was narrow, the nose and chin angular. His\neyes, set in deep hollows, were bright with candor and intelligence,\nthough at times she saw in them a haunted look.\n\nShe even found his barbaric Frankish garb pleasing. From Simon's narrow\nshoulders hung a cloak of rich crimson silk, and he wore a soft maroon\ncap adorned with a blood-red feather. The purple surcoat that extended\nbelow his knees sparkled with dozens of embroidered repetitions of a\ndesign of three gold crowns. In Constantinople only the Basileus and his\nconsort were permitted to wear purple. From Simon's black leather belt,\ndecorated with silver plates, hung a curving Saracen sword. Precious\nstones twinkled in its handle.\n\nNow that she considered it, she recalled that she had always seen Simon\nin more subdued colors.\n\n_He dressed this way to please me_, she thought fondly.\n\nHe looked away from her, but there was nowhere for him to look. They\nwere walled in on all sides by a thick growth of pines. The lower trunks\nof the trees were straight and clean, like the poles of a palisade,\ntheir branches, which started higher than she could reach, putting out\nthe bright green needles of new summer growth. Somewhere far above them\nwas the cloudy, rain-heavy sky, but here they were enveloped in deep\nshadow under interlocked pine branches. The forest was so dark and\nsoundless that she began to feel a little frightened. Simon and she were\nenemies, after all, even though she hoped he would never realize it. She\noften forgot it herself, when she was with him, liking him as much as\nshe did.\n\n\"I am not going to Perugia,\" he said.\n\n\"Did you have me ride all the way out here to tell me no more than\nthat?\" she demanded.\n\n\"I wanted to tell you that I love you,\" he said hoarsely. He turned\ntoward her, and his face glowed with adoration.\n\n_Oh, the boy! The dear, beautiful boy! He loves me, and he means it with\nevery fiber of his being._\n\nShe felt a wave of warmth, not love but surely a kindliness, going out\nfrom her to him. He turned and took her shoulders in his big hands. She\nliked the feel of his hands on her. If only she could forget about\nDavid, she could happily give herself to him.\n\nBut she _was_ acting for David, and she was here to find out what this\nFrank was planning. She must make some guesses, and then see if she\ncould get him to confirm them. Such as, where was he going, and why was\nhe leaving the Tartars behind?\n\nShe had to tilt her head back to look into his troubled face. \"Come, let\nus sit down,\" she said. She took his hand and led him to a tree whose\ntrunk was wide enough to let them rest their backs against it. Her silk\nskirt formed a dark green semicircle around her, bordered by an\nembroidered orange and red design of flowers.\n\nThere was a grace in the way he sat down, despite his long arms and\nlegs. With a practiced movement he swept his sword back behind him, out\nof his way.\n\n\"Where were David of Trebizond and Giancarlo the night of the attack on\nthe Monaldeschi palace?\" he asked suddenly. She went cold. Did he\nsuspect them, and her too? Had d'Ucello told him of his unsuccessful\neffort to see David and Lorenzo that very night?\n\n\"They had both left the city,\" she said. \"They went to Perugia and\nAssisi. David wished to see the wonder-working body of San Francesco at\nAssisi.\"\n\n\"I thought he was interested in silk, not saints.\" Simon glowered at\nher.\n\nShe made herself laugh. \"Surely you do not think David the merchant was\nin the streets, fighting, the night the Monaldeschi were attacked?\"\n\nShe heard a bell ring somewhere in the distance. Some little hillside\nchurch ringing out the hour of Tierce. The chiming sounded clear and\npeaceful.\n\n_Dear God, sometimes I wish I could have become a nun._\n\nSimon sighed and took her hand gently and held it resting on his thigh.\n\"Why does it have to be Cardinal Ugolini who is your uncle?\"\n\n\"If not for my Uncle Adelberto I would not be here and we would never\nhave met,\" she said.\n\n\"You are so beautiful,\" he said.\n\nThe adoration in his eyes was like a dagger in her heart. She wanted so\nmuch for it to be for her, and it was for a woman who did not exist.\n\n_I am so far from what he thinks I am. Michael and Manfred treated me\nlike a whore. David sends me to seduce this man who is his enemy._\n\nAnd that, she thought, was why she so much hated to see what had\nhappened to Rachel, and to know that David had done it and that she\nherself had a hand in it.\n\n\"You will never come back to Orvieto, will you?\" she said\ndisconsolately.\n\nHis grip on her hand tightened. \"No. That is why I wanted to meet you\ntoday. Tell me--if your uncle goes to Perugia to follow the pope, will\nyou go with him?\"\n\nShe let her body lean sideways till she was pressed against him. \"Oh, I\nam sure my uncle will go. He is the cardinal camerlengo, after all. As\nfor me, I would go if I thought I would see you there.\"\n\nHis head drew down toward hers. \"Do you care for me that much?\"\n\n\"I have never known love like this, Simon. My husband was kind to me,\nand I was sorry when he died, but the way I feel about you is\ndifferent. I think I will die if I do not know when I can see you\nagain.\"\n\nJoy lit up his thin face, and she despised herself. \"I will find you,\nSophia. I will be gone for months. But I will ride like the wind, and\nwhen I come back it will be to Perugia.\"\n\n_He must be going to France!_ He was traveling with but one man, so as\nto go faster. The Tartars had nearly been killed in the Filippeschi\nuprising, but he would be leaving them for _months_.\n\nOnly one thing could be more important to Simon than the lives of the\ntwo Tartars, and that was what the Tartars represented.\n\nThe pope must be offering to approve the alliance. Simon must be\ncarrying the message.\n\n_When I tell David about this, he will ride after Simon and kill him._\n\nHer thoughts began to race. Even if Simon were stopped, was it not still\ntoo late to keep the Franks and the Tartars from joining forces? No,\nprobably not, because the pope was dying. If this alliance were not\nsettled now, the talking and deciding would have to begin all over\nagain, with a new pope.\n\nCould she seduce Simon into abandoning his mission altogether, running\noff with her? No, he would never betray so great a trust, not even for\nlove of her.\n\n\"I swear to you, I will find you, I will see you again, Sophia,\" he was\nsaying. \"Believe me.\"\n\n_You will not live long enough._\n\n\"I do believe you, Simon.\" Her loathing for herself grew stronger.\n\nNow his arms were around her, and he was pressing her back, away from\nthe tree trunk and down onto the soft bed of pine needles.\n\nHis open mouth was against hers, his lips devouring hers. His hands\ncaressed her shoulders and her back, moving ceaselessly. One hand slid\naround and held her breast, and she heard his little indrawn breath of\npleasure. It must feel good to him, she thought. It felt good to be\ntouched there, and she pushed back against his hand. She felt her body\nrelax and grow warm. It had been so long--nearly a year--since a man had\nheld her in his arms.\n\n_I need this as much as any man does. Men can go to whores, but where\ncan I go?_\n\nShe loved the feel of his strong arms around her as she lay beside him.\nHe moved so that his whole length was pressed against her, and now he\ndid not seem any taller than she was. She felt the hardness at his\ngroin that he pressed against her leg, and she felt an answering heat\nwithin herself.\n\n_No!_\n\n_I cannot let this man make love to me and then send David after him to\nkill him. I cannot, I cannot. I would hate myself forever._\n\nShe felt her body opening to him, felt her bone-deep need of him. If\nthey came together now, it would be love, not the love she felt for\nDavid, but love even so. And if she condemned him to death then, she\nwould destroy herself. But if she did not tell David where Simon was\ngoing, she would betray him, and bring ruin down on his people and her\nown. If she let Simon make love to her, she would be so torn that\nafterward she would probably go mad.\n\nHe was already partly on top of her, and she wriggled away from him,\npushing at him.\n\n\"Stop it!\" There was a power in her voice that she had not intended to\nunleash. She was no longer Cardinal Ugolini's sweet little niece, Sophia\nOrfali from Sicily, but Sophia Karaiannides, the woman of Byzantium.\n\nA hand's width of space separated their faces. Her voice seemed to\nfreeze him. He stared at her as if he were seeing a stranger.\n\nThen anger blazed up in his eyes. His arms tightened. Those arms seemed\nso lean, but the strength in them was like steel chains drawn tight. She\nclenched her fists and locked her bent arms in front of her to keep him\naway. His lips drew back from his teeth and she felt his hot breath on\nher face.\n\n_Frankish barbarian!_ she thought. Where only a moment ago she had\nwanted him, now she hated him. He was just like all those mail-clad\nsavages who had destroyed Constantinople, stolen, raped, murdered her\nparents. Yes, and she had helped the Basileus Michael to drive them out,\nand she would kill this one too. Never would a union of Frankish and\nTartar barbarians threaten her people. By this one man's death she could\nguarantee that.\n\nWith all the strength her anger gave her, she straightened her arms,\npushing him away. Her right arm free, she thrust her open palm against\nhis jaw, forcing his head back.\n\n\"Let me go!\" And again it was the powerful voice of Sophia Karaiannides.\n\n\"God's blood!\" His eyes were wide, and there was amazement in them, no\nlonger anger. He released her so suddenly she fell back, hard, against\nthe floor of the forest.\n\nImmediately he reached for her, but his hands were gentle once more,\nhelping her to sit up.\n\nHe knelt before her. \"Please forgive me.\" He sounded on the verge of\ntears. \"Please. I lost command of myself.\"\n\nStanding up, she brushed pine needles from the back of her skirt and her\nshawl. He moved to help her, and she pulled away.\n\n\"Sophia, I have never loved any woman as much as I love you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Simon, you have far to ride.\"\n\nHe moved around so that he was facing her, his usually pale face\nflushed, his chest heaving.\n\n\"Marry me, Sophia.\"\n\nIf he had struck her, she could not have been more astonished. But she\nquickly recovered herself. He thought he could have his way with her by\noffering marriage.\n\n\"Simon, I am not a woman whose legs can be parted by a promise of\nmarriage.\" The note she heard in her voice distressed her. She was being\ntoo much her true, worldly self with him. If he were not deaf to\neverything but his own passion, he would hear it, and he would suspect\nthat she was not what she seemed to be.\n\nShe reminded herself: _I must seem to be awed that this great nobleman\nspeaks to me of marriage._\n\n\"You put it crudely,\" he said, his eyes narrowed with warmth. \"To shock\nme, I suppose. But you defend your honor, and you speak plainly. I speak\nplainly too--I love you.\"\n\nThe sight of him standing there gazing at her with such yearning in his\neyes was too painful. She kept thinking of herself telling David what\nshe had learned today. She kept seeing this tall, handsome man lying\ndead in a ditch. She had to get away from him.\n\n\"The morning is well along,\" she said. \"You had better get started if\nyou want to cover much distance by nightfall. Where do you plan to spend\nthis night?\" She despised herself because she had asked the question to\nmake it easier for David to trail him.\n\nHe frowned at her. \"Sophia, I must have your answer. I mean what I say.\nI love you. I want to marry you.\"\n\nHoly Virgin, would the fellow never give in? Did he really think her\nfoolish enough to believe he was sincerely proposing to her? Yes,\nperhaps he did think that of the Sophia she pretended to be. She must\nanswer him as that girl would. She cast her eyes down, her hands clasped\nbefore her.\n\n\"Simon, do not torment me. I know that you cannot marry me. My uncle has\ntold me who you are--your ancient noble house, your vast holdings.\nPerhaps you mean to be kind to me by speaking of marriage, but a man of\nyour rank has too many obligations. You cannot marry as you choose. So,\nplease, speak of it no more.\"\n\n_But what if we could get married?_\n\nThe thought arose unbidden in her mind as she stared down at the brown\npine needles. She wanted to drive it out again, but could not stop\nherself from seeing what it might be like.\n\nMarriage, a home, a fixed, secure abode where she might live out her\nlife in serene, peaceful occupations. Raising children, spinning,\nembroidering, managing a household. What so many women, rich and poor,\nhad. What she had not known since she was a young girl--a _place_, a\n_family_. And to be the wife of a man like Simon--kind, brave, handsome,\nwell spoken.\n\nShe understood suddenly why it was always so easy for her to forget\nSophia Karaiannides and become Sophia Orfali. She did what was given her\nto do, but in the core of her heart what she longed for was to be\nsomeone like Sophia Orfali, who truly had a place in the world. Sophia\nOrfali, for all that she was a mask, was more real than Sophia\nKaraiannides.\n\nIt was too painful for her, the unexpected longing for the love she\ncould never have, the grief for Simon, whom she was going to murder.\n\n\"Let us get back, you to your scudiero and I to my escort,\" she said.\nShe started walking toward the road.\n\nHe stepped in front of her. \"Sophia, wait.\"\n\nShe felt something in her chest like a ball of iron. She had her tears\nwell under control for the moment, but she had to get away from him.\nOtherwise she would not be able to stop herself from crying.\n\n\"Please,\" he said again. She felt herself forced to look up at him. His\nthin face, so grave, so intelligent.\n\n\"I beg you to believe me. I do want you desperately. Love is of the\nspirit, and it is of the body too. But I am not proposing marriage just\nto possess you. I want to marry you because I love you.\"\n\nShe stood looking at this handsome young man and breathing the fragrance\nof pine-scented air, and she thought of David. What she felt for David\ndrew no line between body and spirit. If she had all the things she had\njust been longing for--a husband, a family, a home--and David appeared\nout of nowhere and looked at her with those glowing eyes of his and told\nher to come with him, she would abandon everything for him. When she\nlooked at David, she saw a pillar of pure fire burning inside him. There\nwas a power in him that called out to everything that was strong in her\nand demanded that she accept no other man for her mate.\n\n\"You think that my title, my family, is an obstacle to our marrying,\"\nSimon said. \"But it is not. If you knew who I really am, you might not\nwant to marry _me_.\"\n\nShe laughed a little at the thought of him not being who he so obviously\nwas. \"Are you some peasant lad who stole the place of the true Simon de\nGobignon, then?\"\n\n\"It is something like that.\"\n\n\"In God's name, Simon, what are you talking about?\"\n\nHis nostrils flared. He drew air in a great gulp through his mouth. He\ntook a step toward her, and she tensed, lest he seize her again, but he\nkept his hands at his sides.\n\n\"The last Count de Gobignon was a traitor to his king, to his\ncountrymen, to his own vassals. He betrayed a whole army of crusaders\ninto the hands of the Saracens. He died in disgrace. His grave is\nunmarked. So foul was his treachery that no man of good family in France\nwill permit his daughter to marry me.\"\n\nSophia found that hard to believe. There must be many great barons in\nFrance who would forget the crime of the father, no matter how horrible,\nwhen the son was so attractive and, especially, so rich.\n\n\"Simon, you have so much to offer a wife.\" She would have laughed at the\nabsurdity of all this, but the tortured expression clearly mirrored a\ntortured soul.\n\n\"Oh, surely, there are barons who would sell their daughters to the\ndevil for a bit of land,\" he agreed. \"I meant that I could not marry the\nwomen I chose. But there is worse, Sophia. I could lose everything if\nwhat I am about to tell you were known, but that is the least of it. It\nputs my life in your hands and the lives of my mother and--my father.\"\n\n_Your life is already in my hands_, she thought, her eyes hurting from\nlooking so intensely into his. But then the full meaning of what he had\nsaid bore in on her.\n\n_His father?_\n\n\"Simon, are you telling me that you are not--\"\n\n\"I am not the son of the Count de Gobignon. My father was a troubadour,\nthe Sire Roland de Vency, with whom my mother fell in love while Amalric\nde Gobignon was still alive. She succeeded in passing me off as the\ncount's son, but we three, my mother, Roland, and I, know the secret.\nAnd my confessor. And now you.\"\n\nShe shook her head, bewildered. She felt no doubt that what he was\ntelling her was true. The pain in his face was like that of a man who\nhad stripped his very skin off to reveal himself to her. It tore at her\nheart to see him suffering so much.\n\n\"But how could this happen, Simon?\"\n\n\"It is too long a tale for today. Perhaps one day I can tell you all of\nit. But do you believe me now? Truly there is no barrier of family\nbetween you and me, Sophia. Unless you set one there, knowing that I\nam--I am a bastard and an impostor. Could you think of marrying me?\"\n\nThe tears she had been holding back, for an hour it seemed, burst\nsuddenly from her eyes, as sobs welled up in her throat. And yet, she\nwanted to laugh as well, at the irony of it. To think that he was\nashamed of his pretense. If he had any idea of _her_ pretense, and\nDavid's, he would probably kill her on the spot.\n\nHis face, coming nearer and nearer. All his finery was a red and purple\nblur before her tear-filled eyes. His hands were reaching for her.\n\n_He loves me. He really loves me. He really does want to marry me._\n\nIf he had taken that strange Saracen sword of his out and run her\nthrough with it, he could not have hurt her more. She had been thinking\nabout sending David to kill him, and he had just entrusted all of\nhimself, his family, everything he possessed, his body and his soul, to\nher.\n\nIf David went after him, this time one of them--Simon or David--would\nsurely die. The luck of the Monaldeschi palace encounter could not\nprotect both a second time.\n\nShe felt Simon's hands on her shoulders. She pulled away from him.\n\n\"Sophia!\" She heard the anguish in his voice.\n\nTartars and Muslims were a thousand leagues away. If Christians and\nTartars were destined to join forces and destroy Islam, it would happen.\nShe willed herself to believe that. And if it was not destined, it would\nnot happen.\n\nDavid and Simon were here. To say anything to David about Simon's\nmission to France was to doom one man, perhaps both. It might be the man\nwho loved her, or it might be the man she loved. And she did not want\neither to die.\n\n\"Sophia, I beg you, speak to me! Are you turning against me?\"\n\nShe wiped her streaming eyes to see Simon standing before her, his arms\nhanging at his sides, his face agonized.\n\n_I cannot doom this young man._\n\nShe took deep breaths to calm herself enough to speak to him.\n\n\"Simon, I pray that God will bless and protect you.\" She stifled a sob.\n\"I cannot marry you. You must forget me.\"\n\nHe scrambled to his feet, his arms outstretched. \"Do not turn from me,\nSophia. I would rather have you kill me.\"\n\n\"No!\" It came out of her as a scream. She turned and started to run,\nholding up the hem of her long skirt to keep from tripping. Her anguish\nwas like a giant's hand that had seized her heart and was crushing it.\n\nShe ran like a hunted animal, tripping on rocks, turning her ankle in\nhollow places. She could only hope she was running toward the road.\n\n\"Sophia!\"\n\nShe looked back over her shoulder. He was following her out of the\nforest, but at a distance. He was walking, staggering like a wounded\nman.\n\n\"Forgive me, Simon!\" She ran on.\n\nA pine branch struck her across the face, and she cried out in pain. But\nshe felt that she deserved it. She ducked under the branch and kept\nrunning, seeing brighter light among the dark rows of tree trunks now.\nThe road must be that way.\n\nShe forced her way through a tangle of shrubbery and was out on the\nroad. Simon's scudiero, standing with their string of horses, stared at\nher wide-eyed. The huge Riccardo, Sophia's escort, was with him,\ntalking. They were standing with their backs to a roadside statue of the\nVirgin in a little protective shed.\n\nAt the sight of Sophia, Riccardo rushed to her, looming over her\nprotectively. \"Madonna! What has happened to you? Dio mio! Did he--\"\n\nHis eyes were wide with outrage, but there was anxiety in his face too.\nHe must be wondering whether he would have to fight a nobleman.\n\n\"I am not hurt--he did nothing. He did nothing!\" Sophia babbled, choking\ndown sobs. \"Mount quickly, Riccardo, and let us go from here.\"\n\nHe held her horse, and she threw herself into the saddle. She spurred on\nwithout waiting to see if Riccardo was ready to follow.\n\nWhen they came to a turning in the road, she looked back once. The\nscudiero stood alone with the horses. Simon had not yet emerged from the\npine forest. She started to cry again. The pain in her chest was worse\nthan ever. She silenced Riccardo's questions.\n\n\"I cannot talk about it. He did no wrong to me. No harm. That is all you\nneed to know.\"\n\n_I cannot talk to anyone about it, ever. I am going to betray David. I\npray God I never see Simon de Gobignon again._\n\n\n\n\nXLVIII\n\n\nJust as Sophia and Riccardo arrived at the Porta Maggiore in the city\nwall of Orvieto, the air around them seemed to glow and crackle. A cold\nwind blew across the road leading up to the gate. Sophia spurred her\nbay, but the horse hardly needed encouragement to gallop the last few\npaces to the shelter of the gatehouse. A shaft of lightning dazzled\nSophia, and a mighty thunderclap, loud enough to shake the rock on which\nOrvieto stood, deafened her. She and Riccardo were in the shelter of the\ngatehouse before the first fat drops began to fall, making craters in\nthe dust of the road.\n\nThey identified themselves to the guards without dismounting. Clerks\nwere no longer posted at the gates to interrogate and record the name of\nevery person entering and leaving Orvieto. Evidently the podesta had\ngiven up on that.\n\nSophia, Daoud, and Ugolini had, even so, been chilled by a polite letter\nfrom d'Ucello to Ugolini requesting that \"His Eminence's distinguished\nguest from Trebizond\" not leave Orvieto without the podesta's\npermission. Sophia, on the other hand, seemed free to come and go as she\npleased.\n\nThe thought crossed Sophia's mind that she would be soaked as she rode\nfrom the gate to Ugolini's mansion. But the meeting with Simon had left\nher in misery, and the storm suited her mood. David knew that she was\nmeeting Simon outside the town. Now what would she tell David about\nwhere Simon was going?\n\nShe was about to ride on into the city streets when a man stepped out of\nthe crowd that had gathered for shelter under the gateway arch. He\nraised a hand.\n\n\"Madonna!\" It was Sordello. \"A private word, I beg of you.\"\n\nShe saw fear in his face, but in his bloodshot eyes burned another\nfeeling she could not identify. She disliked the man and did not want to\ntalk to him, especially not now, carrying secrets as she was. But he\nserved David, and his disturbed look suggested that what he had to say\nmight be important. Sighing, she dismounted, gave the reins of her\nhorse to Riccardo, and walked beside Sordello to an unoccupied corner of\nthe gatehouse.\n\n\"You know that Messer David has set me to find the informer among us,\nand he says he will kill me if I fail.\" He had backed her into the\ncorner and pressed uncomfortably close to her. His breath smelled of\nonions, and he was altogether repellent.\n\n\"What do you want of me?\"\n\n\"The one person who might give me a clue is the Count de Gobignon, and\nhe has disappeared. No one at the Monaldeschi palace will tell me\nanything about why he left.\"\n\n_Does he know that I just met with Simon?_\n\n\"Why ask me?\"\n\n\"I know that it is Messer David's wish that you allow de Gobignon to\ncourt you. If he has left Orvieto, perhaps you have heard where he is\ngoing.\" He smiled, showing a gap in his upper front teeth. And now she\nrealized what the hidden feeling was. It was lust. She was disgusted,\nand pushed past him to give herself room.\n\nHe said, \"I saw you ride out earlier today, and I waited here at the\ngatehouse for you to come back. You must have met with the count.\nMadonna, I do not know what to do. And Messer David will kill me if I do\nnot tell him something.\"\n\nShe desperately wanted to get away. \"I am going to Messer David myself\nto tell him that Count Simon has left for Perugia. Where the pope is\ngoing. He is recruiting more guards and preparing a refuge for the\nTartar ambassadors. You'll gain nothing with Messer David by telling him\nthe same thing.\"\n\nSordello frowned thoughtfully. \"No, but I might try to catch Count Simon\non the road and talk to him.\"\n\nSophia's heart leapt with alarm and seemed to lodge in her throat. What\nif Sordello followed Simon and discovered he was on his way to France\nand came back and reported _that_ to Daoud?\n\n\"You needn't go to all that trouble,\" she said, keeping a grip on her\nvoice. \"We will all be going to Perugia shortly, and you can question\nCount Simon there.\"\n\nHe nodded, as if satisfied with that, and she felt a little better.\n\nHe bowed again and again. \"Thank you, Madonna, thank you.\"\n\nIn a moment she was on her horse again and riding into the rain. She\nwanted nothing more to do with Sordello.\n\nBut the encounter had helped her in one way, and now she felt more\nconfident about talking to David about Simon. Rehearsing the lie with\nSordello had helped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He is leaving the Tartars behind? After I came so close to killing\nthem?\"\n\n\"They will be closely guarded. I do not think you will be able to get at\nthem again.\"\n\nThere was a bitterness in the small smile that quirked David's thin\nlips. \"I do not intend to try until the Sienese arrive here. When I seek\ntheir lives again, a whole army of guards will not be enough to stop\nme.\"\n\nWhat would David do, Sophia wondered, if he learned that the alliance he\nhad fought so hard to prevent would soon be sealed in France by Simon de\nGobignon?\n\nShe looked at David's eyes, the color of the thunderclouds outside. Her\nhatred for herself struck her heart with hammer blows.\n\nHe stood by the window of his room, straight and broad-shouldered,\nwearing a belted gown of black silk with a broad red stripe at the\nbottom. His wound no longer required a poultice, and it was almost\nhealed. The strange Saracen treatment he had prescribed for himself had\nworked.\n\nShe saw pain in his eyes, a pain of the heart. \"No doubt you will miss\nthe count,\" he said in a low voice. He turned to look out the window.\n\nHe had pulled the leaded pane of glass slightly inward on its hinge,\nletting into the room the cold breeze stirred up by the storm. Locks of\nhis blond hair fluttered around his forehead. She studied his profile,\nthe nose long and straight, the chin sharp, the brows seeming to frown\neven when relaxed.\n\n\"You wanted me to make love to him,\" she said softly.\n\nHe kept his face turned. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"You did not want me to make love to him.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe stood in the center of the room, about ten paces from him, her hands\nclasped before her. Her shawl and her gown were cold and wet. A net of\nsmall pearls held her hair in place, but her hair, too, was sodden with\nrain. She felt on the verge of shivering, but she held herself very\nstill.\n\nWhite light filled the room. David's body jerked, and his lips\ntightened. A long, rolling peal of thunder followed the lightning,\nending in a crash so loud it hurt her head.\n\nHe was afraid of thunderstorms. She had noticed that before. There was\nlittle rain in the part of the world where he had grown up. He was\nafraid of nothing else, as far as she could see. There was nothing he\nwould not do, nothing he _could_ not do. If only he were Greek, what a\nfighter for the Polis he would be.\n\nBut when he winced away from the lightning, she wanted to cradle his\nblond head against her breasts.\n\nThe rain beat down on the walls and roof of Ugolini's mansion with\nredoubled intensity. She saw a small pool of water on the wood floor,\nrain blown in through the open window.\n\n\"I never did make love to him,\" she said, raising her voice to be heard\nover the wind and rain.\n\n\"I know that.\" He took a step toward her.\n\n_I am doing worse than that now_, she thought with a stab of guilt. _I\nam keeping from David something he would badly want to know._\n\n\"He put his arms around me and kissed me many times,\" she said.\n\nDavid turned fully to look at her, saying nothing.\n\n\"Whenever he took me in his arms, I thought of you.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nWhen she was with David she never grieved over the turns her life had\ntaken. She never felt sorry for herself, as she did with Simon, because\nshe had not married and could not marry. Simon had actually said he\nwanted to marry her, and in the end she had believed him. That seemed\nlike a dream now. A pleasant dream, but an impossible one.\n\nFor an instant she tried to picture herself, a woman of Constantinople\nwed to a Frankish lord and living in a castle in the north of France. If\nsuch a preposterous thing should come about, she would be enormously\nwealthy and powerful--though she had not really thought about that when\nshe was with Simon. She was not herself when she was with Simon. And\nnow, when she _was_ herself and able to see things clearly, the wealth\nand power still did not matter, because they would give her no pleasure\nif she had to live among barbarians.\n\nWhen she was with David she never worried or even thought about her\nfuture, what life would be like for her when she was older. With David\nshe thought only of now.\n\nHe had opened his eyes and was staring at her. She looked at him,\nstanding tall and fair.\n\n_I love you, David. I want you so._\n\nWhy had it not happened? Soon it would be a year since they had met at\nLucera, and she had long known that she wanted him, and believed that he\nwanted her as well. But something had always held him back.\n\nHer body grew warm inside her cold garments.\n\n_It is not because of me that we have waited this long._\n\nThere was a question in his eyes, and she felt something inside her\npulling her toward him. She took a faltering step across the tile floor.\nThen another, surer one.\n\nHe held out his arms, his harsh mouth softening as his lips parted\nslightly.\n\n\"Come to me,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched her walking toward him one step at a time, and he thought she\nlooked like a woman in a trance. Her head was lifted to receive his\nkiss.\n\n\"How like rose petals your lips are,\" he said in Greek. He had never\nspoken Greek to her before. She stopped her slow march toward him and\ngave a long, shuddering sigh.\n\nThen she ran the last few steps and threw herself into his arms. Joy\nflooded his chest as he pulled her against him.\n\n_At last, at last, at last!_\n\nHe had wanted to hold her like this for so long, and much of the time\nhad not even been aware that he wanted it.\n\nHe had not wanted to be aware of it, he thought, knowing that he must\nuse her against his enemy. And how he had hated Simon de Gobignon simply\nbecause Simon was to have Sophia.\n\n_I should have known then that my hatred for de Gobignon was a measure\nof my love for her._\n\nBut he had not wanted to know that either, because Blossoming Reed, the\ndaughter of the sultan, awaited him in El Kahira, and he had sworn to be\nfaithful to her all his life.\n\n_Take as many women as you like. But love always and only me._\n\nHe felt a chill, and realized that he was feeling cold not merely\nbecause of the memory of Blossoming Reed's warning, but because Sophia\nwas rain-wet against him. She had ridden through the storm still\nthundering away outside, and he felt a cold dampness soaking through his\ngown.\n\n\"Your clothes are wet,\" he said, continuing to speak Greek.\n\nShe rubbed herself against him. \"I am wet to the skin. I need to take\nthese clothes off.\"\n\n\"Yes. Why not do that?\"\n\nWithout hesitation she stepped out of the circle of his arms and undid\nthe brooch that held her printed shawl around her shoulders. She would\nnot be shy, he realized. There had not been time, in the life she had\nled, for hesitation with men. Only, he hoped that she would not, like\nsome of the experienced women he had known, show little feeling herself\nwhile she let him use her in any way that pleased him.\n\n_She is not that sort. I know it._\n\nFoolish of him to even think it. But some part of him needed to doubt.\nThis moment was too good to be true.\n\nAnd too frightening. Because what they were about to do was not just\nsatisfy their bodies' hungers; it would seal the bond of love between\nthem. And then he would not be able to send Sophia like a falcon to\nstrike at his enemies. He would not be the same man when he went back to\nBlossoming Reed. What they were about to do would change both their\nlives.\n\nStanding in the crumpled heap of orange and green silk that was her\nshawl, she turned her back to him.\n\n\"Help me with the laces,\" she said. He saw that her gown laced down the\nback.\n\n\"One small moment,\" he said, running his hand caressingly over her back.\nHe walked to the door. There was still pain in his right thigh when he\nmoved quickly, but now it was overwhelmed by his body's yearning to have\nthis woman. He felt the swelling and pressure of arousal in his loins.\n\nHe opened the door of his room partway and looked up and down the\nshadowy corridor. There was no one in sight. He closed the door firmly\nand slid home the heavy iron bolt that would guarantee their privacy.\n\nShe was standing where he had left her, watching him, her amber eyes\nwarm. He went quickly to her and untied the knot in the laces at her\nback, marveling at the slenderness of her neck. She could have unlaced\nthe dress herself, he saw, but she wanted him to.\n\nShe wore no belt, and the dress fell away. Under it was a white silk\nchemise without sleeves. Still standing behind her, he dropped his hands\ngently on her small, square shoulders and slid the chemise down. His\neyes followed its fall, savoring her delicate shoulder blades, the\nshadowed hollow of her back. All that remained now were light green hose\nattached to a wisp of silk that girdled her hips.\n\nSophia shivered, and he knew it was not the cold, though the storm was\nblowing a strong, moist breeze through the partly opened window.\n\nHe put his hands on her shoulders, firmly now, and turned her around.\nShe threw back her head and laughed as he stared at her breasts and bit\nhis lower lip.\n\nWhat Daoud carried under his black gown felt as big and heavy as a mace.\n\nHe dropped to one knee before her. He reached around to her buttocks,\nhis palms tingling at their cool firmness, and he slid down the last of\nher garments. She stood, all exposed, before him.\n\n\"Will I not see you naked?\" she said with a throaty chuckle. \"Is that\nthe Turkish way, for the man to remain clothed?\"\n\n\"You will soon learn what the Turkish way is, my lady.\" He leaned\nforward, still genuflecting, and dropped a dozen light kisses on her\nbelly and thighs, and then buried his face in the rich triangle of hair\nbetween her legs and kissed her deeply.\n\nShe cried out in surprise and pleasure.\n\nSuddenly he stood up and swung her up in his arms like a Bedouin\nchieftain carrying his bride to his tent. She laughed delightedly. She\nfelt as light as a child. He strode across the room to the bed and laid\nher down.\n\nHe wrestled his black silk gown over his head and threw it off. Quickly\nhe pulled off the locket Blossoming Reed had given him and dropped it on\nthe gown. He stood over her, looking down at her, and letting her look\nher fill at him.\n\n\"The blond Turk,\" she said in Greek with a small smile, and moved her\nhips from side to side.\n\nSlowly she reached up to her head and pulled free the net of pearls\nwoven into her hair. Long locks, black as raven's wings, spread out\naround her head on the pillow.\n\n\"I must look like Medusa,\" she said.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"A woman with snakes for hair. Men who saw her were turned to stone.\"\n\nHe remembered now: In a bazaar at El Kahira he had listened to the story\nof the she-monster.\n\n\"The sight of you would bring a stone to life,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah, but part of you is already hard as stone. How long are you going to\nstand there? I want you.\" The yearning in her voice made something\nvibrate inside him, as if she had plucked a taut string in his very\nsoul. He was seized by a violent urge to throw himself upon her and take\nher at once. And she would welcome it, too, he knew.\n\nBut this moment was too precious to be allowed to pass so quickly.\n\nHe sank to his knees and reached out to pull her hips to the edge of the\nbed. She squirmed across the bed to help him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust after he grew out of boyhood, when he was very wild and afraid of\nnothing, Ayesha, the youngest wife of Emir Faruk abu Husain, discovered\nthat he existed, and showed him a way to come to her in abu Husain's\nharem. He knew he would die writhing on a spike if the emir's slaves\ncaught him, but he was also quite certain that such a thing could never\nreally happen to him.\n\nWith a boy's eagerness and excitability, he had spent himself an instant\nafter he joined Ayesha in the darkness on her couch.\n\n\"The emir is very old and has many wives,\" she purred. \"Rarely can we\nslip a beautiful young man like you past the harem guards. So we must\nlearn how to pleasure each other. There are many things that will\ndelight a woman's body besides a man's rumh. Shall I show you?\"\n\nHe was curious, and at his whispered agreement she pushed his head down\nbetween her legs and told him what to do.\n\n\"And put your fingers _here_ at the same time. Ah, that feels very\ngood.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at Sophia lying open before him and said again, \"How like a\nflower.\" He saw dew on this flower, and he bent to taste.\n\nHe did to her the things he had learned from Ayesha and later on from\nother harem women.\n\nAs he worked upon Sophia the magic of the harem, he listened to her\nbreathing as it grew faster and faster. He watched her breasts rise and\nfall, her chestnut-color nipples standing up.\n\nShe groaned and tossed her head from side to side, the groans turning to\nscreams as she reached a pinnacle. He brought her to another, and\nanother.\n\nPanting, almost crying, she put her hand on his head. \"No more. This way\nof the Turks is wonderful, but I want you inside me now.\"\n\nHe stretched himself full length beside her, put his face, wet with her\nown sweet liquor, against hers and kissed her with lips and tongue. She\nseized his shoulders, her nails digging into his muscles, and pulled him\nover on top of her.\n\nThe way was so well prepared that he was within her in an instant. He\nknew that he could not hold himself back very long, and he gave himself\nup to the floodtide of pleasure. He raised his head a little so that he\ncould look down into her wide amber eyes, and so that she could see into\nhis soul at the moment when he gave all his force to her.\n\nAlmost at the same moment the muscles in her face tensed and her neck\ncorded. Through clenched teeth she cried out again and again and again.\n\nTheir bodies relaxed together. Daoud felt that now, in the aftermath of\nfrenzy, their flesh was melting and flowing together and becoming one.\n\nThey lay in silence, and a distant growl of thunder told him that the\nstorm outside had passed. He had not noticed its dying away. He felt a\ncool breeze blowing through the windows.\n\nIt seemed as if hours passed while they lay there in silence, arms\naround each other, legs entwined, and he listened to her breathing\nslowly grow calmer.\n\nShe stroked his cheek and played with the blond hairs on his chest. \"Is\nanything changed now?\"\n\n\"For us, I think, much is changed.\"\n\nShe kissed him lightly on the cheek. \"I love you. Does love mean\nanything to you Muslims?\"\n\nHe laughed softly. \"Of course it does. _In this world, women and perfume\nare dearest to me._ So spoke our Prophet, may God commend and salute\nhim.\"\n\nShe shook her head and ran her finger down his forehead and nose. \"I am\nglad I am as dear to you as perfume. You say 'our Prophet,' lying there\nlooking more French than Simon de Gobignon. Of course, that is why your\nsultan sent you here. If I, who know what you are, still find it hard to\naccept you as a Saracen, those who do not know would never suspect.\"\n\nAs she spoke the name de Gobignon, he felt a twinge of anger. Just his\nname, mentioned in their bed, was an intrusion. Her eyes flickered\nmomentarily away from his, as if she, too, realized it was an error.\nBest, he thought, to say nothing about it.\n\n\"Yes, I am truly a Muslim, and Muslims know more of love, I believe,\nthan most Christians.\" But now he thought of Blossoming Reed.\n\n_Why must these ghosts hover over us?_\n\nShe reached out to touch the little leather capsule tied by a thong\naround his neck, the only thing he was wearing at the moment. \"What is\nthat?\"\n\n\"It is called a tawidh. Inside are numbers written on a scroll. It\nprotects me from death by wounding and causes any wounds I do receive to\nheal quickly.\"\n\n\"Tawidh?\" She mimicked exactly the Arabic pronunciation. \"How can\nnumbers on a scroll protect from wounds?\"\n\nHe did not fully understand himself the Sufi belief that all things are\nnumbers, and that numbers written by a holy man could control objects\nand events.\n\n\"One must be of my faith to understand it,\" he said briefly.\n\nShe looked at him earnestly. \"It is so hard to think of you as a\nMohammedan, David.\"\n\n\"Not Mohammedan--Muslim. And David is not my name. My true name is\nArabic. Shall I tell it to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, please. I will use it with you when we are alone together.\"\n\n\"I am called Daoud ibn Abdallah. Daoud is Arabic for David.\"\n\n\"Then your name _is_ David.\"\n\n\"No, it is Daoud,\" he said. \"The sound matters a great deal. It is the\nsound that God hears.\"\n\n\"You believe that God speaks Arabic?\"\n\n\"It is the language most pleasing to Him. Did He not give His message to\nthe Prophet--may God praise and salute him--in Arabic?\"\n\nShe pulled herself closer to him. \"Ah, David--Daoud--do not talk to me\nof religion now. Here and now, let us think not of religions and empires\nand wars, but only of you and me.\" She paused and looked at him a little\nanxiously. \"Do you think the servants or anyone else heard me\nscreaming?\"\n\n\"I saw no one outside. Most of them probably suspect that we have been\nlovers for a long time. But suspicion is one thing. To confirm it by our\noutward behavior could be dangerous. We must continue to act as if this\nnever happened.\"\n\n\"We will do this again, will we not?\"\n\nHe touched her dark red lips with his fingertips and said:\n\n    After suffering the joy of love\n    I have no abiding place.\n    I live only to be\n    With the one I love.\n\n\"Yes, we will do it again. Very soon now. I feel my strength returning.\"\nHe curved his hand around the softness of her breast.\n\n\"Ah, good! I did not want it to be over yet--Daoud.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the first days of the Christian month of July the sun grew very\nstrong, and above the narrow streets and tiny gardens, dust rose. Daoud\nfound the climate more to his liking. Although he believed he would\nnever have a true home or enjoy peace in this life, he felt a happiness\nsuch as he had never known before. And this was strange, because Hulagu\nKhan's emissaries to the Christians still lived, and al-Islam was still\nthreatened with destruction, and while he turned many plans over in his\nmind, he was not sure what to do next.\n\nBut when he and Sophia were together he was able almost entirely to\nforget those threats. And when he was not with her, he carried her image\nin his heart, and his heart was the lighter for it.\n\nHis leg had healed, and it was safe for him to walk the streets now. He\nknew the podesta's men must be watching him, but he feared them less\nnow, because they would not see him limp. They might wonder when he had\nreturned to Orvieto from Perugia, but they would have to suppose it was\nafter the podesta took the clerks away from the gates. Each day he\nwandered through the town, forming plans, observing.\n\nHe sensed a tension in the air, growing a little stronger each day, like\nthe summer's heat. Around the palace of the Filippeschi on the south\nside of the town, in its windows and on its battlements, men stood\nwatchful, holding crossbows, hands on their sword hilts. They were not\nas strong as they had been last April. The bravos Lorenzo had gathered\nand Daoud had lent to their cause had quietly left Orvieto. The\nFilippeschi had lost many men and were thrown back on their own\nresources now. Their grim apprehension was obvious.\n\nDaoud did not speak directly to the Filippeschi. Aside from his one\nmeeting with their leader, Marco, he had avoided any contact with them\nthat might compromise him. He wondered whether Marco had given any\nthought to a suggestion Lorenzo had made to him: that aid might be\nforthcoming if the Filippeschi switched their allegiance to the\nGhibellino cause. Apparently Filippeschi loyalty to the pope went back\ncenturies, and was not easily changed. That was something to be\ndiscussed when Lorenzo returned.\n\nAt the Palazzo Monaldeschi Daoud saw an air of preparation, of forces\ngathering, of confidence. One afternoon Vittorio de Monaldeschi, aged\neleven, in full mail--a child's mail shirt and hose must cost as much as\na man's, and be usable for only a short time--wearing an orange and\ngreen surcoat, rode slowly along the length of the Corso with a dozen\nhorsemen, orange and green pennons on their lances. A show to intimidate\nhis enemies.\n\nBoth sides seemed to be awaiting something, and the air of the city felt\nto Daoud as it did when a thunderstorm was approaching.\n\nThe petty street wars of Orvieto would mean nothing to him soon, Daoud\nthought. Lorenzo had managed to send two messages by way of Ghibellino\nmerchants passing through Orvieto. He had made his way safely to Siena,\nwas negotiating with Rinaldo di Stefano, Duke of Siena, and was\nrecruiting bravos by the hundred. But all was not going quickly enough\nfor Daoud. With the pope on the verge of leaving Orvieto, it appeared\nthe Sienese would not come quickly enough. Unless Lorenzo and the\nSienese arrived in time to trap the pope and the Tartars here, he would\nhave to follow them to Perugia.\n\nOr he could go to Manfred and urge him to make immediate war on the\npope. Every rumormonger in Orvieto claimed that Manfred was on the brink\nof marching out of southern Italy to make the whole peninsula his. But\nDaoud doubted it. It would probably be difficult to persuade Manfred to\ntake any action against the pope, unless the French actually invaded\nItaly.\n\nEvery day he and Sophia spent hours together, sometimes in his chamber,\nsometimes in hers. They chose different times of the day, hoping to make\ntheir meetings less obvious.\n\nThe best times were the afternoons. Most Orvietans slept an hour or two\nafter their noon meal, just as most Egyptians did. Sophia and Daoud\nwould draw the curtains to hold out the heat and dust. They would make\nlove, their bodies slippery with sweat. Then they would lie side by side\nand let themselves cool, talking of what they felt about each other, of\nthe world, of the mission they had come to Orvieto to accomplish.\n\nThey never spent an entire night together. This would cause too much\ngossip among Ugolini's servants. For the benefit of the podesta and\nwhoever else might be watching them, Daoud wanted to maintain the\nfiction that he was a trader from Trebizond, far to the east, and Sophia\na Sicilian girl from Siracusa, and they had very little to do with each\nother. Alone in his bed at night, Daoud sometimes lay awake thinking\nabout what Sophia had come to mean to him. He had fallen in love with\nher, he realized now, long before he first possessed her body.\n\nIf it was their fate to die here in Italy, at least they would have\nknown this happiness first. But if he succeeded in his mission, and if\nhe and Sophia were still alive after that, what then? Return to his\nemir's palace in El Kahira, to Blossoming Reed, bringing Sophia with\nhim? A Greek Christian woman entering a Mameluke's harem? And even if\nSophia were willing, Blossoming Reed would try to kill her. But Sophia\nwould make a formidable enemy for Blossoming Reed.\n\nNo, he could not subject either of them to that. Or himself.\n\nBut for him what else was there? El Kahira was the only home he knew. He\nhad left it only to protect it. He must return.\n\nAll this thinking, he decided, was foolishness. What would happen was\nwritten in the book of God, and one could be sure only that it would be\nvery different from what he expected. Let him concentrate on following\nthe path as far ahead as he could see clearly, and the next stage would\nbe revealed when God turned the page.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn orange radiance suffused Cardinal Ugolini's dining hall, gilding dust\nmotes that hung in the air. A stout maidservant cleared away the\ntrenchers, the round slices of bread on which Ugolini had served spring\nlamb to Daoud and Sophia. She bundled up the knives and forks in her\napron. Daoud's fork was clean. He preferred, among friends, not to use\nthe strange implement, which seemed to him a bida, an undesirable\ninnovation. He ate with the fingers of his right hand.\n\n\"His Holiness takes the road for Perugia a week from tomorrow,\" said\nUgolini. \"You have not told me what you intend to do, David.\"\n\n\"We must await Lorenzo's coming. He and the Sienese may be here before\nthe pope leaves.\"\n\n\"I assure you that if that were possible, the pope would be galloping\nout of town right now,\" said Ugolini. \"His information is better than\nours.\"\n\nSophia daintily wiped her hands and lips with the linen cloth that\ncovered the table. \"Your Eminence, Messer David, I want to use these\nlong July hours of daylight for painting. I beg to be excused.\"\n\nShe refused more wine and genially overrode Ugolini's protests.\nCarefully keeping his face blank, Daoud watched her walk out of the\nroom, tall and straight in a cherry-red gown. He found himself picturing\nthe things they had done not long ago, while Orvieto rested at midday.\nHe turned back to Ugolini to see the little cardinal was also, with a\nlubricious smile, watching Sophia.\n\nUgolini's long nose twitched with amusement as he turned to Daoud.\n\"There have been times when I thought there was a chamber of torment on\nthe top floor of my mansion. The groans, the screams--\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing, Your Eminence,\" said Daoud, keeping his face\nexpressionless.\n\n\"I should have been concerned for the lovely lady, except that she is\nobviously so healthy and serene. Much more serene, I believe, than when\nshe first came here. What do you suppose accounts for that?\"\n\nDaoud shrugged. \"In silence is security from error.\"\n\n\"Is that a saying of one of your Muslim philosophers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Daoud, allowing himself the faintest of smiles. \"The\nPrincess Sheherazade.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun had set by the time Daoud left Cardinal Ugolini, and the\nthird-floor corridor was nearly dark. Servants had placed small candles\non tables at each end of the corridor. Daoud had allowed himself a cup\nof wine with the cardinal because there was nothing else to drink, and\nnow his face felt slightly numb.\n\nA large figure walked slowly toward him from the opposite end of the\ncorridor as he approached his room. With the candlelight behind him, the\nman's face was in darkness, and Daoud tensed himself.\n\n\"Messer David, it is Riccardo.\"\n\nNow they stood face-to-face, Daoud having to look up a little.\n\n\"I searched everywhere. Questioned everyone I know. I would stake my\nlife that Sordello is not in Orvieto. He went out the Perugia gate after\ntalking to Madonna Sophia. I do not think he ever came back.\"\n\nDismissing Riccardo, Daoud went into his room to think and to pray. He\nfelt baffled. He would have staked _his_ life that no man bound by the\npowers of the Hashishiyya would ever turn against the one who showed him\nthe delights of paradise.\n\n_But I did threaten him with death, and he saw that I wanted to kill\nhim. That might have been enough to break the bond._\n\n_And I did wonder, even when I initiated him, whether there might not be\nsome part of him that remained free._\n\nDaoud bolted the door of his room. He needed to be alone, to think and\nto refresh his mind.\n\nHe faced the charcoal-marked spot on his wall that marked the direction\nof Mecca and, with care and thought, went through the sequence of the\nsalat, standing, bowing, kneeling, striking his head on the floor again\nand again until he was done. He asked God, as he did every night, to\nfavor his efforts here in Italy with success, out of His love for the\npeople of Islam.\n\n_I place all in Your hands._\n\nAfter he was finished praying, he unlocked his traveling chest and began\nto take things from it. First came a small grinder box he had bought\nfrom an Orvieto ironsmith, a grinder such as women used to make small\namounts of flour. Next, from a cotton bag he took two handfuls of\nroasted kaviyeh beans given him by Ugolini and put them in the top of\nthe grinder box. He ran the beans through the grinder, rapidly turning\nthe crank on the box until they were a coarse powder.\n\nHe took his old pack out of the chest and found in it the brick of\nhashish wrapped in oiled parchment. It nestled in the palm of his hand,\nand he weighed it, wondering whether he deserved this pleasure. For that\nmatter, did he deserve Sophia? His attempt to kill the Tartars had\nfailed, and now they might be slipping out of his grasp.\n\nWith money and the threat of a French invasion, Lorenzo should be able\nto persuade the Ghibellino leaders of Siena to follow their natural\ninclination and send an army against Orvieto. But that army would not be\nenough to counter the forces the pope could gather around himself at\nPerugia.\n\n_I must get Manfred to march._\n\nWith Manfred's help he could capture the pope and kill the Tartars. And\nhe saw an even larger vision. Under Manfred, Italy could become a\nbulwark against the crusaders from northern Europe. Manfred was not just\nfriendly to Egypt. He had Muslim officials and soldiers and was not far\nfrom being a Muslim himself.\n\nThere was so much to be done. Daoud wanted to go to Siena to hasten the\nGhibellino attack on Orvieto. He wanted to ride to Manfred and urge him\nto invade the Papal States. But he had to remain here as long as the\nTartars were here. Were it not for Sophia, these months of inactivity\nsince that night at the Monaldeschi palace would be driving him mad.\n\nHe held the black hashish cake over the grinder, using his dagger to\nshave small, coiling peels into the ground kaviyeh beans. Then he filled\na small iron pot from his water jar. He poured the mixture of water,\nkaviyeh, and hashish into the pot and set it to boil on a rack over the\nflame of short, fat candle.\n\nHe smiled and inhaled deeply as the rich, burnt smell filled the room.\nJust the smell of kaviyeh could give him visions, making him think of\nthe gaily lighted streets of El Kahira, of the dome of the Gray Mosque,\nof the white arms of Blossoming Reed.\n\nWhen his brew was ready he poured it into an Orvieto porcelain cup\npainted with bright flowers. He carried the cup to his window and pulled\nthe window open. Even though Orvieto was atop a great rock, the starry\nsky seemed much farther away here than when he lay on his back and\nlooked up at the stars in the desert. He wondered how far it was to the\ncrystalline sphere in which the stars were set, like jewels. Was it\nfarther than the distance between Orvieto and El Kahira?\n\nHe recited to himself the invocation, _In the name of the Voice comes\nthe Light_.\n\nStanding at the window, he drank his hashish-laced kaviyeh in slow sips.\nWhen he knew, by a peculiar intensity in the starlight, that the magic\nhorse had begun its flight to paradise, he started to walk to his bed. A\nsudden impulse took him, and he went to his pack again.\n\nFolded inside a square of blue silk he found the silver locket\nBlossoming Reed had given him. Since he had started lying with Sophia he\nhad stopped wearing it. He remembered the suggestion he had planted in\nSordello's mind, that at the sight of the locket he would kill Simon de\nGobignon. With Sordello and Simon both gone, the locket was useless for\nthat purpose.\n\nAs he held it in his hands, he remembered what Baibars's daughter had\nsaid to him:\n\n_I will always know if you are well or ill, alive or dead, and how you\nfare and what you feel. And if you would know how it is with me, seek me\nin this._\n\nHe lay in bed propped up on one elbow and turned the tiny screw that\nheld the locket closed. He had meant to think about Manfred and Sophia,\nto try to catch some glimpse of the future. It troubled him that he had\ntaken this bypath. He remembered now how troubled he had been when last\nhe looked into the locket. He had not meant to use it again.\n\nNow, though, it was somehow too late for him to stop. He seemed to have\nno will of his own. He raised the lid of the locket and looked down into\nit, at the design incised on rock crystal that looked like an\ninterweaving of Arabic letters with circles and triangles. He waited to\nsee what visions the locket would give him tonight.\n\n_The knowledge you run from is the most precious of all._\n\nHe gasped.\n\nA pool of darkness opened in the center of the design. The network of\nstraight and curved lines seemed to crumble into it as the pool spread.\nAnd it began to rotate, slowly at first, then faster. He was looking\ninto a whirlpool of blackness.\n\nIt drew him in. He felt as if his eyes were spinning, then his head;\nthen he fell into the whirlpool and it sucked him down. He could not\nbreathe. He was drowning in blackness.\n\nAt the last moment, when he thought he would die, suffocated, the black\npool released him and flung him back on his bed, contemptuously\nrejecting him.\n\nHe lay there, gasping, terrified.\n\n_Take as many women as you like. But love always and only me. For if you\ndo love another, I promise you that your love will destroy both her and\nyou._\n\nHad he truly heard the voice of Blossoming Reed, burning and cruel in\nhis mind, coming from as far off as the stars? The locket fell to the\nfloor with a crash that seemed to shake the stone building in which he\nlay. He remained motionless, paralyzed with dread.\n\n\n\n\nXLIX\n\n\nFeeling as if he would burst into flames with anger, Simon stood under a\nbright blue sky dappled with high white clouds on a wooden quay at\nLivorno, two weeks after leaving Orvieto. The masts of small boats lined\nthe waterfront like a forest of tree trunks stripped of their leaves.\n\n_If I were traveling with a proper entourage, a few knights and a troop\nof archers, by God's wounds they'd carry me. These shipmasters are too\ndamned independent._\n\nOne large ship, anchored midway between the shore and the arm of the\nharbor, looked to Simon like his last chance. Leaving Thierry on the\nquay, he dropped a silver denaro into the callused palm of a man with a\ndinghy and had himself rowed out to the big ship.\n\nFrom what he knew of ships, this was a middle-size buss, sitting high in\nthe water, with rounded prow and stern. The name _Constanza_ was painted\non the stern. Human muscle moved it; Simon counted ten oarholes on each\nside.\n\nAs he trod the catwalk from the prow of the ship to the stern castle\nwhere the captain stood, Simon saw no one sitting at the oars and no\nchains. So the ship must be rowed by its crew, free mariners. A square\nsail, furled at present, mounted on a single mast amidships would help\nthe rowers when the wind was right.\n\nThe captain, whose bald scalp was brown as well-tanned leather, bowed\ndeeply when Simon presented himself. He was half Simon's height, twice\nas broad, and all muscle. He smiled, showing a full set of bright white\nteeth when Simon explained that he needed passage to Marseilles.\n\n\"Bon seigner, you must understand that it is not a simple matter to\nengage a ship of this size to carry you wherever you wish to go.\" The\nlanguage the captain spoke was neither French nor Italian. Simon\nrecognized it at once, and he felt a little inner leap, because it was\nthe tongue his parents spoke, the Langue d'Oc, the speech of Aquitaine,\nToulouse, and Provence.\n\n\"Of course I understand that,\" Simon replied in the same tongue. \"But if\nyou--\"\n\n\"Bon seigner,\" the captain interrupted, \"there are no words to describe\nhow honored I would be to carry you. And no words to describe my grief\nthat I cannot take you.\" That could be taken two ways, Simon thought.\n\n\"I am prepared to pay prodigiously, Captain,\" said Simon with sinking\nheart.\n\nIf the captain noticed that Simon was speaking in his own tongue, he did\nnot remark on it. \"I do not own this ship. That is the point, you see,\nbon seigner. The owners have instructed me to wait here for a cargo of\nolive oil, which I must take to Cyprus. So I cannot leave now, and when\nI do leave, I must sail away from France.\"\n\nThe captain was respectful enough, but Simon sensed a hidden glee in his\nrefusal.\n\n\"But you have not heard how much I will offer you,\" he said, desperate.\n\nThe bald man shut his eyes as if in pain. \"It does not matter. Merce vos\nquier, forgive me, but I have a duty to those who have entrusted this\nship to me. Surely there must be some other captain in this harbor who\nwill let you make him wealthy.\"\n\n\"I have been to every other captain,\" said Simon. \"All have refused me\nfor one reason or another. Yours is the only ship left.\"\n\nThe captain of the _Constanza_ spread his hands. \"Ah, well, Pisa is only\na little farther north, and there are many more ships docked at its\nquays along the Arno. You are bound to find one that will carry you. Or,\nfailing that, this is the best time of the year to make the journey to\nFrance overland. The roads are good.\"\n\nSimon knew that Pisa had been a Ghibellino city for generations. Word of\nhis coming might even have reached enemies in Pisa. He was sure that he\nand Thierry had been followed along the road they had taken up the\nTyrrhenean seacoast. The Pisans would be only too glad to put an end to\nhis mission, and quite possibly to him. And following the endlessly\nwinding coastal road--which would require him to pass dangerously close\nto Pisa--it would take him a month or more to get to French territory.\nHe decided that this captain meant him nothing but ill. He broke off\nabruptly and made his way back to the rowboat.\n\nA shout of laughter came floating across the water from the _Constanza_\nas the boatman rowed him back, putting Simon in an even fouler mood.\n\nLooking toward shore, he saw a man in a short, dark cape standing on the\ndock with Thierry.\n\nThe boat tied up at a piling, and Simon gave the rower a second denaro\nand climbed up a short ladder to the quay. With a jolt of anger he\nrecognized the man talking to Thierry as Sordello.\n\n_What the devil is he doing here?_\n\nInstantly Sordello was kneeling at Simon's feet, clutching at his hand\nand kissing it and weeping copiously.\n\n\"I followed you all the way from Orvieto, Your Signory. I did not make\nmyself known to you before this because I feared you would send me\naway.\"\n\n\"Get up,\" said Simon impatiently. \"We thought we were being followed by\nenemies. We took unnecessary precautions, thanks to you.\" This utterly\nunwelcome encounter with Sordello, added to the impossibility of finding\na ship, filled him with an almost uncontrollable rage.\n\n\"Your Signory, on the roads of Italy there are no unnecessary\nprecautions.\" The man's expression shifted in the blink of an eye from\nfawning tears to a cocksure grin showing his missing teeth.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Simon demanded. \"I did not give you leave to\nstop watching Cardinal Ugolini's household.\"\n\n\"Circumstances gave me leave, Your Signory, as I was just explaining to\nmy good friend Thierry here.\" Thierry looked startled at being so\ndescribed. \"The woman Ana who carried my reports to you betrayed me. She\ntold Giancarlo, the henchman of the merchant from Trebizond, that I was\nin your service. That Giancarlo is the sort who opens a second mouth in\nyour throat before you can explain yourself with the first one.\"\n\n\"Does anyone else in Orvieto know where I am going?\"\n\n_Good God, was he lurking about when I was with Sophia?_\n\nSordello looked at him out of the corners of his eyes. \"No one knew,\nYour Signory. I had to think it out for myself. I heard you had gone to\nPerugia. But, I asked myself, whyever would you do that? There is\nnothing in Perugia until the pope moves there. What, then, would be\nimportant enough to make you leave off watching over the Tartars? A\nmessage for Count Charles, I guessed--or perhaps for your king--too\nimportant to be carried by anyone but yourself. Then I had to decide\nwhich road you'd take. Directly north would lead to Siena, and we have\nall heard that an army of Ghibellini is gathering in Siena to attack\nOrvieto. So, you must be headed for the coast. And, as we see, my\nguesses all turned out right.\" He finished up with a broad,\nself-satisfied grin.\n\nHow could a man so often foolish also be so shrewd? Simon turned and\nstared out at the water of the harbor, a deeper blue than the sky. What\na nuisance this fellow was! Turning up now, when Simon had problem\nenough trying to find a way to get to France. Simon momentarily saw\nhimself running Sordello through with his scimitar and kicking the body\ninto the harbor.\n\n_And that story about Ana betraying him is almost surely a lie. She is\nnot at all the sort who would do such a thing. Probably he himself did\nsomething stupid that gave him away._\n\nSordello broke in on his thoughts. \"Thierry tells me you want to sail to\nMarseilles, Your Signory.\" He pointed to the high-sided, round-hulled\nship that Simon had just left. \"That buss you were on out there, is that\nnot the _Constanza_? I think I know the master--his name is Guibert. Did\nyou arrange passage with him?\"\n\nGrudgingly Simon told Sordello of his failure with the captain of the\nbig ship. Sordello grunted.\n\n\"It is not right that a man of your distinction and wealth and gentle\nbirth should have to go up and down the dockside begging for a ship.\"\nSimon despised the flattery but could not help agreeing with it. His\nsituation was indeed embarrassing.\n\n\"It is past midday, Your Signory,\" Sordello continued. \"Thierry tells me\nyou are staying at the Hare. A good inn, I know it well. You can get a\ndecent noonday meal there for a denier or two. Meanwhile, let me try my\nluck. I warrant I will find a ship for you before you finish your last\ncup of wine.\"\n\nTired, hungry, and discouraged, Simon thought: _At least it will give me\nan excuse to rest._\n\nAnd Sordello had not yet asked him for money or employment. That was a\nrelief, but Simon told himself to be ready; the begging would start soon\nenough.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFeeling more relaxed, Simon was draining his third cup of red wine when\nSordello reappeared. Bread, cheese, and a stew of goose, onions, and\ncabbage for Simon and Thierry had cost twelve denari. Simon suspected\nthe price had gone up when the host saw the scarlet silk cape and\ngold-embroidered purple surcoat he had worn in the vain hope of\nimpressing the ships' captains.\n\n\"Being cheated and lied to is a normal part of traveling,\" he told\nThierry. \"If you wish to avoid it, stay home. One must be philosophical\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Your Signory!\" Simon saw Sordello's burly figure silhouetted against\nthe blue sky in the open doorway of the inn. He waved him in.\n\n\"Success!\" Sordello sat down at their table without asking permission.\n\"We have passage on a large ship sailing north and west along the coast,\nand stopping not just at Marseilles, but at Aigues-Mortes, whence we\ncan travel north through the Rhone valley.\" Simon noticed the \"we\" but\nsaid nothing. \"It takes on a cargo of woolen cloth and silk and spices\nthis afternoon, and it leaves tomorrow at sunup. We can board our\nanimals and sleep on the ship tonight.\"\n\n\"How much will this cost--us--Sordello?\" said Simon, his improved mood\nmaking him feel a bit like joking.\n\nA quick glance from Sordello's bloodshot eyes showed he understood that\nSimon understood. \"Thirty florins, Your Signory. Oh, and I promised him\nan additional forty-five florins when we get to Aigues-Mortes. That\nlittle extra after the passage helps guarantee that you get where you\nwant to go.\"\n\nThierry whistled. \"Seventy-five florins! We could buy five more horses\nfor that.\"\n\nSordello shrugged. \"But more horses would not get you as far and as fast\nas that ship will. And it is no more than Count Simon would have had to\npay if he had done the bargaining himself.\"\n\n\"Less,\" Simon admitted. In his desperation he had actually been thinking\nof offering Guibert a flat hundred florins.\n\n_Wait! What is happening here?_ he asked himself suddenly. When he had\nfirst seen Sordello this morning, he had fully intended to turn him away\nhere in Livorno. Now he was paying his passage to France. Again he was\nbeing taken advantage of.\n\nHe leaned forward suddenly, planting his folded arms on the table.\n\n\"But why must I take you, Sordello, eh? What further use are you to me?\nCan I not save some florins if I leave you on the dock here?\"\n\nSordello looked pained, brushing the curly gray hair back from his\nforehead. \"What I have just accomplished shows Your Signory how useful I\ncan be.\"\n\n\"Thus far you have nearly ruined my mission by attempting to murder an\nArmenian prince--\"\n\n\"That was more than a year ago, Your Signory.\"\n\n\"And you have failed to learn anything useful as my agent in Ugolini's\nhousehold.\"\n\n\"Your Signory! If not for me, you would have been totally unprepared for\nthe attack on the Monaldeschi palace.\"\n\nSimon saw that Sordello's rough skin was reddening. His bad temper was\nthreatening to break through.\n\nIt was true, though, that Sordello's warning about the Filippeschi\nattack by itself made up for all the man's misdeeds.\n\nThe mention of Ugolini's household brought back the pain of that\nparting from Sophia. He pictured again that dizzying moment when he\nalmost possessed her, remembered how he had poured out all his secrets\nto her. He saw again her tears and remembered his own, that he had shed\nafter she ran from him. The memory made him feel like weeping now.\n\nHoping to sound casual, Simon said, \"The cardinal's niece--I believe her\nname is Sophia. Did you see her before you left Orvieto?\"\n\nSordello's discolored eyes met Simon's. \"No, Your Signory. I have seen\nlittle of her since the night of the Filippeschi uprising.\"\n\n_Damn this gap-toothed brigand!_\n\nSimon continued to pretend to be casual. He stood up and yawned. The\nwine made him feel less in control of his feelings than he liked.\n\n\"Let us go and see this ship you have found for us.\"\n\n\"Your Signory, you have not told me whether you will take me back into\nyour service.\"\n\nSimon shook his head, as if tormented by gnats. \"After we see the ship.\"\n\nSordello sighed and led the way out of the inn. They crossed the\ncobble-paved roadway that led along Livorno's waterfront, Simon\nbreathing deeply of the salt-smelling air to clear his head.\n\nSordello pointed. \"There it is.\"\n\nHe was pointing toward the same big, ungainly buss that Simon had\nvisited earlier, whose captain had refused Simon.\n\n\"But he said he was going to Cyprus!\"\n\n\"He lied to you,\" said Sordello. \"I know the man. Guibert was shipmaster\nfor a boatload of us mercenaries in the last war between Pisa and Genoa.\nHe feared that if you were to travel on his ship, you might find him\nout.\"\n\n\"Find out what?\"\n\n\"He is one of those Languedoc heretics who hate the Church and the\nFrench nobility, a follower of the Waldensian heresy. He was imprisoned\nonce and sentenced to death in Montpellier. He recanted his heresy and\nwas released after signing over all that he possessed to the Church. But\nthen he came to Italy, made a new start, and backslid to Waldensianism.\nIf the Inquisition got him now, he would go to the stake even if he\nrecanted a thousand times.\"\n\n\"Then why has he agreed to carry us?\" To think, the man had seen Simon\nas an enemy. Simon, who had inherited his Languedoc parents' loathing of\nthe persecution of heretics.\n\n\"I told him that if he did not take us where we wanted to go, I would\ntell the officers of the Inquisition here in Livorno about him,\" said\nSordello blandly.\n\n\"What!\" Simon was outraged.\n\nSordello looked hurt. \"Surely, Your Signory does not see any wrong in\nforcing a heretic to do a good turn for the pope and the king.\nEspecially when it means he gets to go unpunished. So we do our duty,\nbut with a leavening of charity.\"\n\nFor Simon to say more would reveal too much about himself and his\nfamily. Fuming, he bit his lip. But another objection came to him.\n\n\"We will have to take turns standing guard the whole voyage,\" he said.\n\"That captain will want to slit our throats to make sure his secret is\nsafe.\"\n\n\"We would have to stand guard anyway, Your Signory. A sea captain knows\nno law but his own greed as soon as he puts out from shore. If you can\npay him seventy-five florins, that tells him you must be carrying a\ngreat deal more money. But I have insured our safety another way. I have\ntold him that an old friend of mine here in Livorno knows his secret,\nand if that friend does not receive a message from me in due course\nassuring him of our safety, he will report Guibert to the Inquisition.\nGuibert would never be able to come back to Livorno, his home base, and\nhe would not really be safe anywhere in Italy.\"\n\nSimon shook his head angrily. \"I like none of it.\"\n\n\"Even the greatest barons, even kings, must put up with much they do not\nlike,\" said Sordello sententiously, \"if they are to get anything done.\"\n\n\"As you said before, Monseigneur,\" said Thierry in a comforting tone, \"a\nman must be philosophical.\"\n\n\"Philosophical, yes,\" said Simon wearily. He could, he supposed, afford\nto be philosophical. If the heretic sea captain did not manage to kill\nthem, in three or four days he would be in France, on his way to find\nKing Louis. All these unsavory doings, indignities, and discomforts\nwould mean nothing if his mission ended in triumph.\n\nThe thought of the King's gratitude, of Uncle Charles's respect, of the\nway the tale would spread among the noblesse of France, bringing him new\nhonor, sent a thrill of pride through him.\n\nAt last he would have proven himself.\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nThe sky was iron-gray, and a cold wind, unseasonably cold for August,\nblew down from the north. Daoud stood near the entrance to the courtyard\nof the Palazzo Papale, facing a row of the podesta's guards, in yellow\nand blue, who held back the watching crowd. A troop of mounted lancers\nclattered out under the gateway arch. Then, in mule-borne litters, came\nthe nine cardinals who had elected to go with the pope to Perugia. Each\nhad his own small procession of clergy and guards. In a sedan chair\nborne by six burly men rode Fra Tomasso d'Aquino, reading a small\nleather-bound book. Then came a hundred mounted archers, their conical\nhelmets gleaming dully under the overcast sky.\n\nFinally, as the people threw themselves to their knees, some crying out\nand stretching their arms wide, Urban himself, on a litter carried by\neight men-at-arms, with a column of priests on either side, came through\nthe open gate of the palace. He wore white gloves on the trembling hands\nthat he raised to bless the people. He was bundled up in a white wool\ncloak, and his head was covered by a hood of fur so white that it made\nhis own hair and his beard look yellowish.\n\nReluctantly, but knowing it would be dangerous not to do so, Daoud\ndropped to his knees as Urban passed him.\n\n\"Do not leave us, Holy Father!\" a man next to him cried out.\n\nDaoud thought of the whispers he had been hearing in his wanderings\nthrough the streets and marketplaces. People were frightened. Some said\nthat terrible things would happen after Urban left. There would be new\nbloodshed between the Monaldeschi and the Filippeschi. The Sienese would\nbesiege Orvieto and massacre its people.\n\nDaoud himself believed d'Ucello, the podesta, would use the pope's\ndeparture to try to increase his own power over the city.\n\n_And that bodes ill for me._\n\nThe podesta was a clever man. Daoud felt certain d'Ucello suspected him\nof the killing of the French knight and of involvement in the\nFilippeschi uprising.\n\nDaoud followed the procession along the curving street to the Porta\nMaggiore, intending to watch it follow the road to the north, wishing\nthe Sienese army might appear suddenly in the distance and intercept it.\nBut at the gate a sergente in yellow and blue stepped into his path.\n\n\"I am not leaving,\" Daoud said, staring at the man. \"I want to stand\njust outside the gate.\"\n\nThe sergente shrugged. He was a broad-shouldered man with a square brown\nface and a mustache cut straight across. As they stood talking, he\ndarted little glances at Daoud's hands and feet, half smiling. Daoud\nsensed that he was ready for a fight, perhaps even wanted one. The\nsergente thought, of course, that he was dealing with a merchant, who\nwould not be as skilled in combat as a professional soldier.\n\nDaoud felt a chill along his spine. D'Ucello was still determined to\nkeep him prisoner in Orvieto. That confirmed Daoud's suspicions that the\npodesta might soon move against him.\n\n\"You can watch the procession from the top of the wall,\" the podesta's\nman said. \"The view is better from up there anyway. You may not go\nbeyond the gate, Messer David.\"\n\nAngered by the feeling of confinement, Daoud thought about throwing the\nguard, disarming him, and walking through the gate just to teach him a\nlesson. But that was hardly what a trader would do. That would only\nbring more suspicion down on him. He nodded curtly and walked away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following Sunday, Daoud stood at the front of the cathedral,\nreluctantly hearing Mass, bodies pressing him from all sides. Four of\nUgolini's men-at-arms, including the massive Riccardo, stood with Daoud.\nThe little cardinal, required by the etiquette of the Sacred College to\nattend but made fearful by the rumors of fighting and killing to come,\nhad begged Daoud to come with him and stay near him. The noonday heat\ntogether with the heat of packed human flesh turned the interior of the\ncathedral into an oven. The reek of sweat mixed with the heavy smell of\nincense rendered the air almost unbreathable.\n\nA gilded screen standing on the altar displayed the miraculous linen\ncloth of Bolsena, lighted candles massed around it. The pope, at least,\nhad left that to Orvieto. Ugolini was one of six red-robed cardinals,\nhalf hidden under their huge, circular red hats, who sat in chairs in a\nrow before the altar. Each one had a cluster of assistants and guards\nbehind him. Cardinal de Verceuil was among them. Daoud recognized him\nfrom the rear because he was the tallest of the six.\n\nThat meant the Tartars were still in Orvieto. If Lorenzo and the\nGhibellino army from Siena arrived in time, there would be a chance to\nkill the Tartars before they rejoined the pope in Perugia. It was\nmaddening, not knowing what Lorenzo had accomplished or where he was.\nThis was one time he wished Christian armies could move with the speed\nand decisiveness of Muslims. Or Tartars.\n\nThe elderly Cardinal Piacenza, his arms supported by priest-assistants,\nheld up the gold cup of wine which Christians believed, in a sense that\nDaoud had never been able to understand, to be the blood of Jesus the\nMessiah. The cathedral was filled with a reverent quiet.\n\nA burst of angry men's voices from the rear of the cathedral broke the\nsilence. Shouts echoed against the heavy stone walls. Daoud heard thuds,\nscuffling, the clash of steel. A jolt of alarm went through him, and his\nhand went to his sword.\n\nEveryone, including Piacenza, turned to stare. The last time there had\nbeen a clash of arms in the cathedral it had been the Count de Gobignon\nand that heretic preacher, Daoud thought.\n\nDaoud was amazed that Christians would interrupt the most sacred moment\nof their Mass. He tried to see over the heads of the people around him.\nOne voice, roaring in protest, was raised over the others. It sounded\nfamiliar to Daoud.\n\nPeople were passing word back from the middle of the nave, where the\nstruggle was. \"It is Marco di Filippeschi,\" a man near Daoud cried.\n\"They have come to kill him.\"\n\nDaoud's body went cold. Might whoever was coming after Marco attack him\ntoo?\n\nThe fighting seemed to be moving toward the doors, and the crowd flowed\nafter it. Mass was forgotten as the congregation, cardinals and bishops\nincluded, rushed to see.\n\nUgolini hurried to Daoud and took his arm. The two of them were carried\nwith the crowd toward the rear of the cathedral. Ugolini clutched at\nDaoud so tightly that his fingers hurt. The servants, Daoud noticed,\nmanaged to stay with them.\n\n\"Stay close to me,\" Ugolini said.\n\n\"You might be safer in the cathedral,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"Outside there is more room to run.\"\n\nThe short-legged Ugolini could not run very far, thought Daoud. He\nsteeled himself. If they were attacked by a large number of enemies,\nthey were dead men.\n\nDaoud and Ugolini came through the main door of the cathedral together\nand stood on the crowded steps.\n\n\"I cannot see!\" Ugolini cried. People on the steps below him were\nblocking his view.\n\nDaoud was tall enough to see quite well. His heart, beating rapidly,\nseemed to be rising from his chest to his throat. Marco di Filippeschi,\nhis long black hair flying as he jerked his body from side to side, was\nstruggling with four men who held him, while a fifth wrapped a rope\naround his arms. Other men used pikes to push back the crowd, forming a\nring of space around the young Filippeschi leader and his captors.\n\n_Marco is going to die_, Daoud thought, feeling cold sweat all over his\nskin.\n\nHe looked to the edges of the piazza and the mansions that overlooked\nit. He saw crossbowmen in the orange and green livery of the Monaldeschi\non rooftops and in windows, and mounted lancers in the outlets to the\nsquare.\n\n_The Filippeschi should have missed Mass today._\n\n\"God damn your puzzolenti souls, you bastards!\" Marco roared as he\nfought. \"May your mothers and fathers burn in Hell!\"\n\nSome men were trying to help Marco; Daoud saw little knots of struggle\nas his eyes traveled over the crowd. But no one could reach Marco\nbecause the orange Monaldeschi tunics were everywhere.\n\n\"What is _happening_?\" Ugolini demanded.\n\n\"They are killing Marco di Filippeschi,\" said Daoud, thinking: _He\nhelped me. He needs help now._ His hand gripped the hilt of his sword\ntightly, and he wanted to draw it and rush down the stairs to fight\nbeside Marco.\n\nBut the knowledge that anyone who went to Marco's aid would die with him\nheld him motionless. Daoud was not free to draw his sword for Marco, not\nwhile the Tartar ambassadors lived and the pope might yet proclaim a new\ncrusade.\n\nMarco was shouting obscenities so rapidly that Daoud's Italian failed\nhim and he could not understand. The Filippeschi chieftain was tightly\nbound and helpless, and the men around him pushed him to his knees.\n\n_God be merciful to him_, Daoud prayed.\n\n\"Lift me up so I can see!\" Ugolini cried to his men-at-arms.\n\n\"You do not want to see,\" said Daoud, but Riccardo obediently hoisted\nhim up to sit on his shoulders. The cardinal looked ridiculous, Daoud\nthought, like an overdressed child being carried by his father.\n\nA man holding a long two-handed sword stepped out of the empty space\nsurrounding Marco di Filippeschi. Daoud drew in a breath. The crowd\ngasped. The blade flashed in the sun like a mirror as he swung it up.\nMarco struggled, shouting curses, twisting and thrashing to escape the\nsword. Blood splashed over the gray-black paving stones as the sword\ncame down. Marco cried out in agony. It took three strokes to behead\nhim.\n\nAs much death as Daoud had seen, this sickened him. He felt bile\nflooding his stomach and rising in his throat.\n\nAfter Marco's head lay apart from his still-trembling body in a rapidly\nspreading pool of blood, the silence was shocking in the piazza that had\nan instant before rung with his cries. As shocking as the look of the\nbound body without its head.\n\nA woman's piercing scream broke the silence. Holding a baby in her arms,\nshe burst out of the ring of men who had cordoned off the beheading. She\nknelt, screaming and sobbing, and reached out with one hand to touch\nMarco's severed head.\n\nAnother woman ran out of the crowd with a dagger in her hand. She\npounced on the mother and baby and stabbed and stabbed. A pikeman in an\norange tunic dragged the baby from its mother's arms, tossed it in the\nair, and caught it on the end of his pike, spitting it. Some in the\ncrowd screamed with horror. Others cheered and laughed.\n\nDaoud's stomach lurched. He pressed his hand against his middle and\nhoped the mother had not lived to see what had been done to her baby.\n\nHe wanted desperately to be away from there, not just because he himself\nmight be in danger, but because he could not stand to watch.\n\nHe looked up at Ugolini. The little cardinal sat rigid on Riccardo's\nshoulders, his face white and blank, his whiskers quivering. How foolish\nhe had been to want to see.\n\nNot far away, de Verceuil's dark face under his wide-brimmed red hat\nstood out above the other faces in the crowd on the steps. The little\nmouth was set in a satisfied smile. Daoud wished he could slash that\nsmug face with his sword.\n\nAnother Monaldeschi man-at-arms set Marco di Filippeschi's head on the\nend of his pike and waved it in the air for all to see. The mob in the\npiazza began to boil. It was a chaos that Daoud's eyes could take in\nonly piecemeal. Men and women fought with swords and daggers and clubs;\nmasses of people shrieking with terror surged toward the streets leading\noff the piazza where mounted Monaldeschi retainers slashed at them with\nswords and drove lances into them; crossbowmen fired into the crowd\nfrom balconies.\n\nNow Daoud's heart was beating so hard that the booming of his blood in\nhis ears almost drowned out the noise in the piazza. This was a war\nbreaking out all around him.\n\nA continuation, he reminded himself guiltily, of the war he had started.\n\nNo, he need not blame himself. He had not started this. These people had\nbeen slaughtering one another long before he came to Orvieto.\n\nHow could the Monaldeschi tell their friends, or the innocent, from\ntheir enemies, Daoud wondered. Perhaps, he thought, it did not matter to\nthem.\n\nHe now made out, on a balcony opposite the cathedral steps, the stooped\nfigure of the Contessa di Monaldeschi. Her cloak glittered with gold\nembroidery, and on her gray hair she wore a small silver coronet. She\nrested one hand on the shoulder of a boy, her grandnephew Vittorio.\n\n_What a monster that child must be!_\n\nDaoud heard Ugolini's choking whisper from above him: \"Get me out of\nhere.\"\n\nThere was only one way to escape, back into the cathedral and out one of\nthe side doors. Daoud helped Ugolini down from Riccardo's back, and they\nhurried through the center doorway, followed by his men-at-arms.\n\n\"Do not draw your weapons,\" Daoud said to Riccardo and the others. \"Or\nyou might get pulled into the fighting. But be ready to stand and fight\nif we must.\"\n\nThe din of the massacre in the piazza echoed within the cathedral, which\nwas now mostly emptied out. Cardinal Piacenza had brought his Mass to a\nquick end. He was sitting in a chair near the altar, looking stricken,\nand a young priest was mopping the old cardinal's forehead with a white\ncloth. On one side of the nave stood the podesta, d'Ucello, surrounded\nby a group of his sergentes in yellow and blue.\n\n_There is murder in the piazza, and the keeper of public order hides in\nthe cathedral_, Daoud thought.\n\nThe podesta's eyes met Daoud's as Ugolini's retinue hurried past him\ntoward the rear doors of the cathedral. There was a menace in d'Ucello's\nset face, but he said nothing as Daoud strode by.\n\nThe look in d'Ucello's eyes told Daoud that the moment when the podesta\nwould strike at him was not far away. Daoud felt as if a ghost had\ngripped the back of his neck with an icy hand.\n\nUgolini, muttering to himself, led the way to the north transept. A\nhalf-dozen men in orange and green tunics, swords drawn, barred the\ndoor.\n\n\"Stand aside in the name of God!\" Ugolini cried as he approached the\nMonaldeschi men-at-arms. \"Your damned bloody quarrels have nothing to do\nwith me.\"\n\nDaoud was surprised. He had often seen Ugolini frightened, but now fear\nseemed to have given him sudden strength. The men guarding the door\nstepped aside. The cardinal's servants held the door for him, and in a\nmoment they were in the narrow street running along the north side of\nthe cathedral, where they joined a crowd of weeping, shouting people who\nhad managed to break loose from the piazza. There were splashes of\nblood, Daoud saw, on the tunics of many men and the dresses of many\nwomen. Ugolini's servants formed a wedge around him, and in stunned\nsilence they walked back to his mansion.\n\nDaoud felt shaken and sick. His hands were trembling.\n\nThe Filippeschi could have been allies for Daoud against the podesta.\nNow he was alone.\n\nUgolini's small contingent of armed retainers could not resist the town\nmilitia. A cold feeling of helplessness settled over Daoud. If only\nLorenzo would come back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBars of afternoon sunlight slanted through the windows of Ugolini's\ncabinet, giving a fiery tinge to his red rug and glistening in the eyes\nof his stuffed owl. Ugolini sat behind his table, holding the painted\nskull in both hands and staring intently at it, as if it held the\nexplanation of what had happened at the cathedral this morning. Sophia\nsat in a chair on the other side of the table, and Daoud stood by the\nwindow.\n\n\"The Monaldeschi and the Filippeschi are both Guelfo families, and the\nFilippeschi have high connections with the Church,\" Ugolini said. \"That\nis why the contessa waited until the pope left before taking her\nrevenge.\"\n\n\"I have seen Christians slaughter Muslims and Muslims massacre\nChristians,\" Daoud said. \"But today Christians were killing mothers and\ninfants that could have been their own. Women were doing some of the\nkilling.\"\n\nUgolini smiled at the skull, but there was no laughter in his round\neyes. \"Are not family quarrels the cruelest of all?\"\n\nDaoud noticed that Ugolini's hands, fingertips pressed against the\nsmooth curve of the skull's cranium, were still quivering. As for Daoud\nhimself, he was quite calm now.\n\n_The last time I was really terrified was when I looked into the locket\nand saw whirling blackness._\n\nHe was still angry with himself about that, knowing what a foolish thing\nit had been to partake of hashish when he was already in a dark mood.\nThe fear he had felt a month earlier after taking the drug and looking\ninto the locket remained with him, clinging to his mind like some\nparasitic insect. It rose to confront him now, as he looked at Sophia.\nWould something horrible happen to her because of him? Blossoming Reed\nhad threatened just that, and so far Blossoming Reed's magic had worked\nwell. Since that vision, the joy he felt with Sophia had been chilled\nsomewhat by fear for her.\n\n\"How safe are _we_ now, with the Monaldeschi rampaging through the\nstreets?\" Sophia asked.\n\nUgolini shuddered. \"And the Filippeschi. Those who are left will be\nstriking back. This city will destroy itself, like a rat eating its own\ninnards. I say leave now. All of us.\"\n\n_Leave?_ Daoud thought. He would be less afraid for Sophia if she were\nin a safer place. But where should he go?\n\n\"Where do you want to go?\" he asked Ugolini.\n\nThe little cardinal drew himself up. \"I am still the cardinal\ncamerlengo, and will be as long as Urban is alive. I am obliged to\nfollow the pope as quickly as I can to Perugia. There is peace and order\nin Perugia.\" He looked at Daoud uneasily. \"What do _you_ want to do?\nStay here?\"\n\n_He is hoping to be rid of me._ Daoud considered Perugia, but there he\nwould have everything against him and no forces to help him.\n\nHe must go to Manfred. Once the pope and the Tartars were safely in\nPerugia, only Manfred's army would be powerful enough to get at them.\nManfred might not want to go to war, but war was inevitable. Clearly the\npope was no longer neutral. He favored the Tartar-Christian alliance and\nwas waiting only for the right moment to announce it. When the pope came\nout for the alliance, the French would come into Italy.\n\nThe time for Manfred to act was now. If he marched north and seized all\nof Italy, including the person of the pope and as many cardinals as he\ncould capture, the French never _would_ invade, because a Ghibellino\npope would not approve a joint campaign of Christians and Tartars\nagainst Muslims. Then, for certain, there would be no alliance.\n\n\"Now that the pope has moved to a place of safety,\" he said aloud, \"only\nKing Manfred can dislodge him.\"\n\nUgolini wrung his hands. \"First you incite the Filippeschi against the\nMonaldeschi. Then Siena against Orvieto. Now Manfred against the Papal\nStates? Sometimes I think you are like one of the horsemen of the\nApocalypse, spreading war wherever you go.\"\n\nAll too true, Daoud thought. He turned to Sophia to see whether she\nagreed with the accusation. She looked at him somberly, but did not\nspeak.\n\nHe sighed. \"I am fighting for my people. For my God.\"\n\n\"I, too, for _my_ people,\" said Sophia quietly. Her tone told Daoud she\nsided with him, and he felt an inner warmth.\n\n\"And what have your people to do with this?\" Ugolini cried. \"Have you\nforgotten that you are not Sicilian but Greek?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Sophia. \"I want to see Manfred in control of Italy.\nHe is a friend of Byzantium. The Franks are our enemies.\"\n\nUgolini shook his head. \"I am the only Italian in this room. And I weep\nfor _my_ people.\"\n\nDaoud strode over to Ugolini's table, pressed his hands flat on it, and\nstared into his eyes.\n\n\"Be _strong_ for your people,\" he said. The hairs on the back of his\nneck rose with excitement as he spoke. He had wanted to try to put\nstrength into Ugolini for such a long time.\n\nUgolini looked bewildered. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Think what Italy would be with Manfred von Hohenstaufen ruling from the\nAlps to Sicily and a pope who supports him.\"\n\n\"A Ghibellino pope?\" Ugolini looked surprised, then nodded. \"Why not? As\na Ghibellino myself, I would rejoice at that. But it will happen only if\nManfred has the College of Cardinals in his power.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Daoud. \"And that is why I must go all the way south to\nLucera, where Sophia and Lorenzo and I started from.\" Ugolini's eyes\nwere brighter, and Daoud felt with pleasure that he had breathed new\nlife into the little man.\n\n\"But the podesta won't let you leave the city!\" Sophia exclaimed.\n\nAgain Daoud felt that cold hand grasp his neck. Perhaps he should have\nleft long ago. He turned from Sophia to Ugolini.\n\n\"You must demand that he let me leave, Cardinal,\" said Daoud, feeling\nless confident than he tried to sound.\n\nOr, he thought, he could escape the way Lorenzo did. He had never truly\nbeen a prisoner here.\n\n\"I will order the servants to start packing for me,\" Ugolini said. \"Of\ncourse, I must make arrangements for Tilia to move, too, and that might\ntake time. Although many of her best clients are gone now.\" He sounded\nlike a man who knew what he was doing and Daoud was relieved to hear it.\n\nDaoud turned from Ugolini to Sophia. The knowledge that he would soon\nleave Orvieto, where he had seen too much of defeat and slaughter,\nlifted his spirits. He smiled at Sophia, and she smiled back. He knew\nshe was thinking the same thought he was--that they had hours to spend\ntogether this afternoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud and Sophia lay naked in her bed, legs entwined, her head resting\non his bare chest.\n\n\"What about me?\" Sophia asked. \"Will I go south with you to Manfred, or\nnorth to Perugia with Ugolini?\"\n\n\"With me, of course,\" said Daoud. At the mention of leaving her, he felt\nas if a cold wind had blown across his naked body. He was surprised that\nshe was even considering staying with Ugolini.\n\n\"I want to be with you,\" she said, caressing his chest with a circular\nmovement of her palm. \"I hate the thought of our being apart. But with\nthe pope and the Tartars in Perugia, you need someone there besides\nUgolini. Someone who has an aim in common with yours. I can help him and\nmake sure that what he does helps you. Helps us.\"\n\nHe ran his fingers through her long, unbound hair. \"I will think about\nwhat you've said. But I do not like it.\"\n\n\"Neither do I. But it may be necessary.\"\n\nA loud knock at Sophia's door interrupted them.\n\nSomething in the urgency of the knock made Daoud spring out of bed and\nreach for his sword, hanging from a peg on the wall. Putting a finger to\nher lips, Sophia got out of bed more slowly and went to the door.\n\n\"It is I,\" the cardinal called through the door in answer to her\nquestion. \"I know David is there with you. Let me in. The podesta is\nhere.\"\n\nThe ghost that haunted him whenever he thought of himself and d'Ucello\nseized Daoud's entire body in a cold, paralyzing embrace. His first\nthought was of escape. But d'Ucello probably had the mansion surrounded.\n\nSophia and Daoud dressed quickly and opened the door for the cardinal.\n\n\"D'Ucello has come here with twenty or more men-at-arms,\" Ugolini said.\n\"He demands that you go with him to the Palazzo del Podesta, David.\"\n\n\"Can you not order him away?\" Sophia demanded. \"You are a prince of the\nChurch. You did that before.\"\n\n\"He waited until most of the power of the Church had left Orvieto,\" said\nUgolini.\n\n\"And until the Filippeschi had been crushed, thinking I might call upon\nthem for help,\" Daoud said.\n\n\"You must try to escape,\" said Sophia.\n\n\"Then what would happen to you?\"\n\n\"We will escape together!\"\n\nDaoud looked at her drawn face, and at that moment he loved her more\nthan ever. His love warmed him, and freed him from the grip of fear.\nThis woman--who had spoken a short time ago so calmly of separation--was\nready to run, to dodge arrows, to hide in ditches, to climb walls, to do\nwhatever she had to, to be near him.\n\n\"If he finds out what you are, we are all doomed,\" said Ugolini. Daoud\nsaw that the small body was aquiver with fear.\n\nHe could imagine what Ugolini was thinking, that the evil he had dreaded\nsince Daoud came to Orvieto had come upon them at last. Just when he\nthought he was about to escape it.\n\n\"He will learn nothing,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"He will torture you.\" Ugolini sat down on Sophia's bed and wrapped his\narms around his stomach. \"We will all die horribly--me, Sophia,\nTilia--everyone who helped you.\" He raised hands curved like claws and\nshook them at Daoud. \"Oh, God, how I wish you had never come here!\"\n\nSophia sat beside Ugolini and put her hand on his knee. \"If we can stay\ncalm, dear Eminence, we can think of a way out of this.\"\n\n\"Even if he tortures me, I will tell him nothing, except that I am\nDavid, the trader from Trebizond,\" said Daoud. The methods of resisting\npain that he had learned from the Hashishiyya would serve him now.\n\n\"You must not think of going with him!\" Sophia cried.\n\n\"It is the only way. If I cooperate, it shows my innocence. The cardinal\ncan use his influence to get me freed.\"\n\nShe jumped up and threw herself against him, weeping. \"You are going to\nyour death!\" He held her tightly.\n\n\"D'Ucello has nothing to gain by killing me,\" he said. \"And surrendering\nto him is the only thing I can do.\" He looked at Ugolini. \"Do you\nagree?\"\n\nUgolini sighed and shook his head. \"I cannot think.\"\n\nGently Daoud freed himself from Sophia's embrace. \"Insh'Allah, God\nwilling, I will return to you.\"\n\nHe turned to the door. Every muscle in his body screamed at him to run,\nor to draw his sword and try to fight his way out. He cringed inwardly\nfrom the thought of imprisonment and torture. He remembered the poor\nmadman whose body they had torn apart with red-hot pincers. He forced\nhimself not to tremble. He took the first step toward the door, then\nanother.\n\n_God, make me strong in the face of my enemies._\n\n\n\n\nLI\n\n\n\"Many think I have little power in this city,\" said Frescobaldo\nd'Ucello. He sat in a dark window recess with one foot up on the ledge\nand the other dangling, his fingers tapping the raised knee. Lashed to a\nchair in the center of the long, narrow chamber, Daoud had to turn his\nhead to look at him. Daoud's back ached from being held rigid by the\nback of the chair, and the ropes bit into the muscles of his arms and\nlegs.\n\nAt the end of the room, a clerk with scalp shaved in the clerical\ntonsure sat in the podesta's high-back chair behind a heavy black table,\nwriting down what was said on a scroll with a feather pen. Four tall\ncandles set in brass stands formed a square around Daoud, casting a\nbright light on him. A row of candles burned in a wrought-iron\ncandelabrum beside the clerk, lighting a wall hanging behind him that\ndepicted some idolatrous Christian religious scene. D'Ucello sat in the\nshadows that lay upon the rest of the chamber.\n\nDaoud sensed that d'Ucello meant what he had just said as a sort of\nchallenge.\n\n\"All I know is that for my part I have very little power in this city,\nSignore,\" Daoud said with a smile. \"I depend altogether on those who\nhave befriended me.\" That was the way David of Trebizond should respond.\nNot very frightened, because not guilty of anything. Humble,\ningratiating, but retaining some scrap of dignity.\n\nD'Ucello stood up suddenly, strode briskly across the room to Daoud, and\nstood over him.\n\n\"Do you think your friends will save you from this?\" he said tonelessly.\nHis eyes had an unfocused look, as though they were made of glass.\n\n\"Save me from what, Signore?\" Daoud put bewilderment and a shade of\nanger into his voice.\n\nD'Ucello swung his hand. Daoud felt the sting of a hard palm against his\njaw, and the crack of flesh slapping flesh made his ear ring. The blow\njolted his head to one side.\n\nIt was not very painful. It was meant to insult more than to hurt. To\ntest. And rage did erupt in Daoud like a fountain of fire. His muscles\ntensed, the bindings cutting deeper, and the chair creaked.\n\nD'Ucello was trying to break through the Mask of Clay. But the mask held\nfirm, because the Face of Steel, Daoud's spiritual armor, was beneath\nit. The fury of Daoud the Mameluke, who yearned to tear d'Ucello apart,\nremained hidden. It was David of Trebizond who blustered at the\nindignity of being slapped without cause.\n\n\"How dare you strike me, Signore!\" he protested. \"I have done nothing to\ndeserve that, nothing to deserve being dragged here in the night and\ntied up. I demand to know--what do you want of me?\"\n\nD'Ucello sighed like a chess player whose opponent had escaped check,\nand went back to his seat in the window recess. Daoud saw the flickering\nglow of heat lightning through the thick leaded-glass window behind the\npodesta.\n\n\"I dislike intensely being made to waste time,\" said d'Ucello, drumming\nhis fingers on his knee. \"Listen carefully: Every time you force me to\ntell you something we both already know, I will prolong your suffering\nanother hour.\"\n\nDaoud allowed a note of fear to creep into his voice. \"Suffering? I beg\nyou, Signore, believe me. Even if you torture me, I still cannot tell\nyou anything different from what I will freely tell you. Ask me whatever\nyou want.\"\n\nThe Mask of Clay was useless with this man, Daoud saw. The podesta's\nmind had pierced it. How had he been able to do that? Because he was a\nman who observed much and thought much, unlike most men Daoud had met in\nOrvieto, who let their passions rule them.\n\nYet d'Ucello had passions. He was a proud man, who must hate standing by\nhelplessly, holding the supreme office in Orvieto, watching the two\ngreat families bespatter his city with blood. If he could not stop the\nFilippeschi and the Monaldeschi from murdering each other, at least he\ncould do _something_.\n\nD'Ucello had seen enough of Daoud's comings and goings to make him\nsuspicious. Like a hawk soaring above a plain, the podesta might be too\nhigh up to know exactly what he saw below, but he knew when he sighted\nprey. And perhaps d'Ucello saw that this prey, if hunted rightly, would\nlead him to others.\n\nD'Ucello leaned forward, out of the shadow of the window recess.\n\n\"There was a man in black who tried to kill the Tartars the night of the\nFilippeschi uprising. What do you know about him?\"\n\n\"I know little about the uprising, Signore, since I was not here. I was\nin Perugia.\"\n\n\"Why Perugia?\"\n\n\"To speak with several silk merchants.\"\n\n\"Are there those in Perugia who will vouch for you?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Daoud, feeling uneasily that d'Ucello was not\ndeceived.\n\n\"I will write to the podesta of Perugia and ask that your witnesses be\nexamined,\" said d'Ucello. \"Give me their names.\"\n\nDaoud had a struggle to remember the names of the witnesses. Lorenzo had\ngiven them to him months before, members of the Ghibellino network who\nwere willing to perform this service for Manfred. The clerk's pen\nscratched rapidly as he haltingly brought out the names of five men.\n\n\"When did you return from Perugia?\"\n\nThe clerks, Daoud recalled, had been removed from the town gates at the\nend of May.\n\n\"Sometime in June,\" Daoud said. \"Forgive me, I did not think to bring my\njournal with me, and I cannot tell you the exact date.\" He tried a weak\nsmile.\n\n\"Where is your man Giancarlo?\"\n\n_On his way here from Siena with an army, Insh'Allah._\n\n\"I sent him on from Perugia,\" Daoud said. \"He travels to Rimini, then\nRavenna, eventually to Venice, looking for those who would be interested\nin receiving shipments of silks and spices from Trebizond. He had not\nbeen punctilious about writing to me, or perhaps his letters have been\nlost, so I do not know exactly where he is now.\"\n\n\"I thought you were in competition with the Venetians.\"\n\nDaoud essayed another smile. \"That is why I sent Giancarlo.\"\n\n\"And where were you the night the French cavaliere was murdered?\"\nd'Ucello asked.\n\n\"I was with a woman.\"\n\n\"What was her name?\"\n\n\"I do not think I ever knew it.\" He tried a flash of sarcasm. \"If I had\nknown there was to be a murder that night, I would have asked her\nname.\"\n\n\"Everyone was with a nameless woman that night,\" d'Ucello sighed. \"Yes,\nyou should have taken more care to arrange for proof of your innocence,\nMessere.\"\n\nHe gestured to the clerk, who picked up a small bell on the table beside\nhis ink pot and shook it, a silvery clangor.\n\nTwo broad, leather-faced men in the yellow and blue tunics of the watch\ncame into the room. They took a few steps toward d'Ucello and stood\nawaiting orders like a pair of mastiffs.\n\n\"Take him down,\" said d'Ucello.\n\n\"Wait! Will you torture me? I have tried to tell you the truth. Do not\ndo this, I beg you.\"\n\nD'Ucello slid off the window ledge. \"I am the sort of man who would\nrather spend hours picking a lock than break it open.\" The smile that\nstretched his thin mustache was genuine. \"But, as we both know, the\nGhibellini of Siena may be upon us at any moment, and I must break you\nopen quickly. So now I will sleep. And while I am restoring my strength,\nmy men will prepare you for our next talk.\"\n\nDaoud tried to keep the Face of Steel firmly in place while with the\nMask of Clay he feigned helpless terror. But his defense against feeling\nseemed to have flaws. Genuine terror of what he was about to suffer kept\nseeping through. When d'Ucello's guards untied him and forced him to\nstand, his knees nearly buckled under him.\n\nThe steps Daoud descended must have been hollowed out by the feet of\nhundreds of hapless prisoners and their guards. The wall of the circular\nstairwell, which Daoud brushed with his fingertips to steady himself,\nwas of rough-hewn black stone.\n\nHis heart was thudding heavily as he descended the stairs, preceded by\none guard, followed by the other and by d'Ucello's clerk. The thought of\nhours, perhaps days, of pain he must undergo made every muscle in his\nbody tremble. The stairwell, lit at long intervals by torches held by\nwrought iron cressets, went down so far it seemed to have no bottom.\nMany a prisoner must have felt the temptation to throw himself down from\nthe stairs and escape suffering.\n\nThe chamber he entered through a door of thick oak planks had been\ncarved from the yellow-gray rock of Orvieto's mesa. The room smelled of\nfire, blood, rot, and excrement.\n\nA man slid down from a chair when Daoud entered with his guards.\nStanding, his head would have come to Daoud's waist. But he was bent\ndouble and held his arms out from his sides to keep his fingers from\ntouching the ground, so his head was not even as high as Daoud's knees.\n\nMemories flashed through Daoud's mind: The woodcutter who had blessed\nhimself when Daoud was arrested at Lucera. The executioner who had\ntossed the heretic's cod into the air to the delight of the crowd before\nOrvieto's cathedral. Daoud had always wondered how the little man had\ncome to appear in two such different places. The skin crawled on the\nback of Daoud's neck. This creature was uncanny.\n\n\"You are to keep him awake all night, Erculio,\" said the guard who had\nfollowed Daoud into the room.\n\n\"Did I not sleep all day today, so that I would be able to properly\nentertain our guest tonight?\" The little man bustled forward to Daoud,\nrubbing his hands. His head was as big as that of a full-grown man, but\nhis hands and feet were small. His mustache bristled in spikes of black\nhair, like a portcullis over his mouth.\n\n\"Please, in the name of the mercy of God,\" Daoud pleaded. \"I am a\nmerchant. I am rich. Do not hurt me. I will pay you well.\"\n\n\"We want to hear nothing from you except frequent screams and answers to\nthe questions the podesta wants me to put to you,\" said Erculio in a\ncold voice. \"What do we want to know, Vincenzo?\"\n\nD'Ucello's clerk said, \"The podesta believes he is a Ghibellino spy sent\nhere by the bastard King Manfred. He thinks he incited the Filippeschi\nuprising. Also he may have killed the French cavaliere.\"\n\nErculio nodded vigorously. \"Well, then, Messere. Are you prepared to\nadmit your guilt, now that you see where you are and realize what is\nabout to happen to you?\"\n\n\"These accusations are false!\" Daoud cried. \"I swear it!\"\n\nThe tonsured clerk, carrying a handful of quills, a bundle of scrolls,\nand his ink pot, seated himself at a table in one corner of the room and\nbegan to write.\n\nTo gain time, Daoud looked around Erculio's domain, remembering the\nsimilar room in Tilia's brothel where he had subjected Sordello to the\nHashishiyya initiation. This place was starker and more frightful. It\nwas large, perhaps fifty paces on a side, divided by two rows of thick\ncolumns holding up the weight of the great stone building above it.\nDespite its size, the chamber was well lit. The candle sconces were\nlined with sheets of tin to throw extra light.\n\nDaoud recognized most of the implements of torment around the room. A\nrack, a tilted wooden table with chains and winches. A sharp-pointed\nwooden pyramid over which a victim could be suspended. A chair with\nspikes protruding at the joints. A coffin lined with spikes. A brazier\nfull of pokers and branding irons of various sizes. Weights and pulleys.\nWhips and cudgels, hung neatly from pegs that lined the walls. A cage\nfull of rats. A number of smaller devices to crush fingers or limbs--or\neven skulls--laid out neatly on tables beside rows of long needles.\n\nDaoud visualized himself drinking from a bowl of liquid light and felt\nthe mind-created drug Soma pouring down into his stomach and spreading\nto his heart and lungs, through all his veins.\n\nBut still he must keep up the Mask of Clay.\n\n\"I can say no other than what is true,\" he cried. \"I am David of\nTrebizond. I came here to sell silk. I have harmed no one. Please be\nmerciful.\"\n\nErculio grunted. \"Strip him and string him up.\"\n\nDaoud protested weakly, letting his voice tremble as the guards pulled\nthe clothes from his body. He felt the cool, dank air of the cellar on\nhis bare skin.\n\n\"Be careful,\" Erculio said. \"That is a good embroidered tunic. The hose\nand boots are new. Those clothes are my property now.\" Fussily, he\nfolded the garments as they fell away from Daoud and laid them on a\nchair.\n\n\"Will you not return them to me--afterward?\" Daoud quavered.\n\n\"Afterward?\" Erculio laughed.\n\n\"What is this?\" said one guard as he used his dagger to cut the thong\nthat held the leather capsule around Daoud's neck. The tawidh, that\nhealed his wounds and protected him from death.\n\nDaoud said nothing.\n\n_Now they can truly destroy my body._\n\nThe guard handed the tawidh to Erculio, who glanced at it and threw it\non his low chair. He frowned at Daoud.\n\n\"Put a loincloth on him, fools,\" he growled. \"Did I say to strip him\nstark naked? Are we not decent fellows here?\" He fumbled about in a pile\nof rags and threw one to a guard.\n\n\"That's the first time you've complained about a prisoner being naked,\nErculio,\" the guard grumbled as he wrapped the cloth around Daoud's hips\nand passed it between his legs. \"Don't you need to be able to get at his\ncock?\"\n\n\"Do not try to teach me my craft,\" Erculio said snappishly. \"Up with him\nnow.\"\n\nThe guards grabbed Daoud by the arms and pushed him under dangling\nchains. They lifted his arms over his head and bound his wrists with\nthick leather cuffs. Then they went to a winch with a crank on each\nside, next to the wall, and began to turn in unison.\n\nDaoud cried out in pain as his body was jerked into the air. The leather\ncuffs cut into his wrists. His shoulders felt as if his arms were being\ntorn out of their sockets.\n\nHe pictured the Soma cascading through his body, and the pain receded.\nBut he continued to cry out as if in unbearable agony until the two\nguards stopped raising him. He hung there, the Mask of Clay sobbing and\nwhimpering.\n\nErculio scuttled over to stand under him, holding a thick stick as long\nas a man's arm. Daoud's feet were just level with Erculio's head.\nLeaning on the stick, Erculio looked up at Daoud, appraising his body,\nand a pink tongue tip flickered under the bristling mustache.\n\n\"You have a beautiful body, Messere. Well-proportioned, with powerful\nmuscles. You are un bello pezzo di carne, a fine piece of meat.\" Erculio\nwalked around behind him and stopped there for a moment, where Daoud\ncould not see him.\n\n\"Scars from old wounds, too, I see,\" the little man said.\n\n_Perhaps in this light the scar left by the Tartar's arrow looks old._\n\nErculio stood before him again. \"You look able to endure much, so you\nwill last longer. You may think when a guest comes down here I just pick\nthe first instrument that comes to mind. Not so. I follow a strict\norder. You will get to know every instrument here, if you live long\nenough. This will be very educational for you.\"\n\n\"I have been telling you the truth,\" Daoud moaned. \"Will you not believe\nme?\"\n\n\"Bugiardo! Liar!\" Erculio struck him hard on the shin with the stick.\nPain blazed through his leg. Daoud could have remained silent, but he\nshrieked loudly, knowing that fear, as much as pain, would make the man\nhe was pretending to be cry out.\n\nTurning to the others, Erculio said, \"What will you wager against these\nhandsome clothes of his that I get this pezzo di carne to speak the\nwords our honorable podesta wants to hear? A bet makes this game more\ninteresting. What say you, any takers?\"\n\n\"The man is quivering like a frumenty now,\" said one guard. \"He would\nhave been talking long ago if he had anything to say.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" Erculio snapped his fingers. \"Good. Bet with me, then.\"\n\nThe guard fumbled in a purse at his belt and drew out a glittering coin.\n\"There you are. A gold florin, not ten years old and barely worn. I won\nit dicing last night.\"\n\nErculio examined the coin. \"Twenty years old, and the lilies are a bit\nwilted. But it's heavy enough, I suppose. Done! Now, Messer\nPezzo-di-Carne--I call you that because I do not know your real\nname--you had better tell us what we want to know, or I will _really_\nmake you suffer.\" He dropped the coin on top of Daoud's clothing.\n\nErculio brought the stick against Daoud's shin, in the spot he had\nstruck a moment ago. The pain shot through Daoud. But Soma turned the\npain to a tingling, and Daoud visualized it as a glow that spread from\ntoe to hip. He screamed, as he knew he should, but behind the Face of\nSteel he felt at peace.\n\nErculio let out a laugh that sounded more like the clucking of a\nchicken. \"You see, we do not need elaborate instruments. We can inflict\nunbearable pain with the simplest means--like this!\" And he swung the\nstick to hit precisely the same spot on Daoud's shin he had struck twice\nbefore.\n\nDaoud bellowed and felt the tingling and saw the glow in his leg, and\nthe Soma, the drug created by his spirit, preserved his sanity.\n\nHow small Erculio looked, crouched down on the stone floor. So man must\nlook to God. God was so infinitely far above man, the miracle was that\nGod was mindful of man at all. But God was inside of man--inside of each\nhuman being--as well as above him.\n\n_It is blasphemy to liken myself to God._\n\nHe called to mind the Koran's admonition, _There is none like unto Him_.\n\nHis mind occupied with God, he barely noticed the activities of the\nspiderlike creature that crawled about on the floor below him as he hung\nlike a trapped fly. Erculio worked on his legs for a long time, bruising\nthe shins with his heavy stick until Daoud thought both legs must be\nbroken. Then the torturer pressed a red-hot poker against the soles of\nhis feet.\n\nErculio had the guards let Daoud down and force him to walk on his\nburned feet to the rack table, where they chained him facedown and\nstretched him till the ligaments that held his bones together were ready\nto snap.\n\nThe Mask of Clay screamed and pleaded for mercy and insisted he had\nalready told them everything. But the pain lay as far from his\nconsciousness as the sea lies from the desert tent of a Bedouin.\n\nErculio applied more instruments to Daoud's body, inflicting many kinds\nof pain--burning, stabbing, bruising, crushing. He kept Daoud awake, and\nDaoud knew that hours must have gone by, perhaps the whole night.\n\nDaoud's outcries grew hoarser and weaker, and at last Erculio's efforts\nbrought forth nothing from him but soft groans and whimpers.\n\nDaoud saw the clerk, Vincenzo, rise yawning and leave as another clerk,\nalso shaven-headed, but with a short brown beard, came in to replace\nhim. He saw the two guards in yellow and blue sit down on the floor,\ntheir backs to the wall, and doze off. He saw after a time the second\nclerk lower his head on his folded arms. He saw all this while Erculio\npranced about him, hurting him and hurting him.\n\nErculio looked around at the others in the chamber. He left off pushing\na needle into Daoud's ankle and rushed over to the guards and shouted at\nthem to wake up. He poked them with his stick. They cursed him and\nkicked at him and went back to sleep. He scurried to the sleeping clerk.\n\n\"You are supposed to be writing down everything the prisoner says. Come\nnow, wake up! Indolento! The podesta will hear of this, I promise you.\"\n\nThe clerk mumbled something without raising his head from his arms.\nErculio nodded with satisfaction and hurried across the chamber to\nDaoud. He stood by Daoud's head.\n\n\"As-salaam aleikem, Daoud ibn Abdallah,\" the torturer whispered.\n\nFor a moment Daoud could not believe he had really heard it. The drug\nthat he had brewed in his mind had taken control of his ears. Or else\nthis was their way of tricking him into talking freely.\n\n_But if they knew my Muslim name and that I speak Arabic, they would not\nwaste time accusing me of being a Ghibellino._\n\n\"Wa aleikem salaam,\" he replied. The uprush of joy he felt at finding a\nfriend here in this terrible cellar momentarily shattered the Face of\nSteel. What madness this was, that the friend should be the source of\nall his torment? He bit back hysterical laughter.\n\n\"Like you, I serve El Malik Dahir,\" Erculio said in Arabic. Hearing that\ntitle, Daoud thought it even less likely that the little man was trying\nto trick him.\n\n\"I have been watching you since Lucera, My Lord,\" Erculio went on. \"You\nhave done well, even if it has been God's will that you should not\nsucceed. You have been clever. But you should have taken the tawidh off\nbefore you surrendered. Do you think there are no Christians who can\nrecognize Arabic numerals?\"\n\nNow Daoud was sure the little man was an ally of some sort.\n\nIn Arabic he said, \"Does the scar on the back of my leg look fresh?\"\n\n\"It has healed so completely that no one would believe you got it a few\nmonths ago. They know nothing of our Islamic medicine. You bear another\nwound, though, that would have much to say to the observant--your\ncircumcision. That was why I had them put a loincloth on you and lay you\nfacedown on this rack.\"\n\n\"Lucky for me you were here,\" Daoud said.\n\n\"Not luck,\" said Erculio. \"El Malik deemed it wise that, should you be\nmade a prisoner, one of his men ought to be among your captors.\"\n\n_Even here, Baibars's hand reaches out to me_, thought Daoud, feeling a\nrush of gratitude.\n\n\"Help me to escape,\" said Daoud. \"The guards and the clerk are asleep.\"\n\nErculio brought his small hand downward in a gesture of flat rejection.\n\"There are a hundred men-at-arms on duty up above. The podesta himself\nwill be down here in an hour. Why can you not make up a story that will\nsatisfy him? Say you are a Ghibellino. That is what he believes, and\nsince it is not true, it will not help him. In a thousand years he would\nnever guess the truth.\"\n\n\"No. The only way I can protect those close to me is to admit nothing.\"\n\nErculio shook his head, and his black eyes were liquid with sadness.\n\"What a pity. Your case is hopeless, then. Ever since I saw you in\nLucera I have felt sorry for you. How can El Malik expect one man to\nchange the course of nations? You are like a man trying to hold apart\ntwo ships about to collide.\" He sighed. \"I have done all I can for you.\nI have hurt you as much as I can without doing you permanent injury--so\nfar. There is only one other service I can perform for you.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" said Daoud, though he felt sure he already knew the\nanswer.\n\n\"You would not want to reveal under torture that you are an agent of the\nSultan of El Kahira, and provoke the very crusade you were sent here to\nprevent. You would not want to give your friends away. If you break, I\nwill see to it that you die before you might speak.\"\n\n\"I will not break,\" said Daoud. \"And when it is all over, and d'Ucello\nhas killed me, he will at last come to believe that I was telling the\ntruth. Because he believes that no one can hold out against torture to\nthe very end. But promise me one thing.\"\n\n\"Insh'Allah, anything.\"\n\n\"If you must cripple me, see that I do not leave this dungeon alive.\"\n\nUnderstanding and respect glowed in the black eyes peering at Daoud over\nthe edge of the rack. \"As you wish, My Lord.\"\n\nHe knew he should be grateful that he had this man here to guarantee him\na decent death. But a great sadness came over him at the thought that\nhis life must end miserably in this dungeon. He had always hoped that he\nwould meet his fate amid the glory of jihad, holy war.\n\n_Well, this is jihad of a kind._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe respite was over. Erculio fell upon Daoud with renewed vigor,\ndriving needles under his toenails and fingernails and beating him with\na whip of knotted rawhide cords that tore open his back. Daoud felt the\nblood running down his sides and pooling underneath him. The little man\ntook a red-hot poker and pressed it, hissing, against the scar made by\nthe Tartar's arrow and Lorenzo's knife. That, Daoud realized, would make\nit impossible to tell what sort of wound it had been.\n\nThe pain seemed to be happening to someone miles away as Daoud converted\nit to ripples of light passing through his body. He understood that\nErculio was applying tortures whose effects could be seen. The podesta\nwould be satisfied that Erculio had done his work well.\n\nDaoud did his part too. The rest had restored his strength, and now\nDaoud screamed so loudly he woke the guards and the clerk. Erculio set\nthe guards to work replacing the burned-down candles in the sconces\naround the dungeon. When Daoud turned his throbbing head to look at the\ncandles, he saw hazy rings around them and rays radiating from them.\nSweat stung his eyes.\n\nThe thick wooden door of the cellar swung inward, and d'Ucello entered.\nHe walked over to where Daoud lay on the rack, and stood staring at him\nwith his peculiar, glazed expression. D'Ucello's face was more sour than\nusual, and his eyelids were puffed. He looked just awakened from a sleep\nthat had given him little refreshment. His mouth twitched under the thin\nmustache.\n\nDaoud noticed that in one hand d'Ucello held a small silver flask with a\nnarrow neck and a glass stopper. D'Ucello clenched his hand around it\ntightly, as if he feared to drop it.\n\n\"What has he said?\" he demanded, turning to Erculio.\n\n\"Just much screaming, Signore.\" Erculio looked across the room at the\nbearded clerk, who nodded vigorously.\n\n\"You have not hurt him enough, then, Erculio,\" said the podesta. \"He\nshould be offering us _something_ by now. To withstand torture for so\nlong almost smacks of sorcery.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he really has nothing to tell,\" Erculio ventured.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" D'Ucello glared at the dwarf. \"Even an innocent man would\nmake the torture stop, if he had to lie to do it. And this man is not\ninnocent.\"\n\n_By that one remark Erculio risks much for me_, thought Daoud, praying\nthe little man would not again endanger himself.\n\n\"Attenzione,\" said d'Ucello, coming close to Daoud's head and holding\nthe flask so Daoud could see it. He withdrew the stopper, a long icicle\nof glass. He held the flask low over the rack table and tilted it\nmomentarily. A few drops of dark brown liquid splashed onto the wood. At\nonce d'Ucello righted and stopped the flask.\n\nA white flash, bright as lightning, burst before Daoud's face, blinding\nhim.\n\nHe jerked his head back and squeezed his eyes shut. He heard Erculio\ncurse in Italian and the clerk and the guards cry out.\n\nSmoke burned Daoud's nostrils and throat. As he coughed, he opened his\neyes and saw a small fire burning its way into the wood a hand's breadth\nfrom his face. He felt a wave of heat. D'Ucello and his men watched in\nsilence as the fire ate through the thick planking of the rack table.\nGradually the blaze lost its intensity as the liquid that started it was\nused up. It ended in a hole a man could pass his fist through, with\nglowing, smoking edges.\n\n\"What _is_ that?\" said the clerk, tugging nervously at his brown beard.\n\n\"Witchcraft,\" said d'Ucello with a grim chuckle. The clerk and the\nguards stared at him. Erculio was expressionless.\n\nIn spite of Soma, in spite of his years of training, Daoud felt a scream\nof horror rising inside him at the thought of what d'Ucello was\nthreatening.\n\n\"Not witchcraft, but just as evil,\" d'Ucello went on. \"It is a weapon\ndevised by the Byzantines.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the clerk. \"This must be that Greek Fire I have heard\ncrusaders tell of. I always thought it another of their lies about the\nEast.\"\n\n\"It is real,\" said d'Ucello. \"Perhaps our guest, being from the East,\nhas seen it before. The Turks stole the secret from the Byzantines and\nhave been using it against the crusaders. It starts burning the moment\nit is exposed to air. It clings to whatever it touches, and its flames\ncannot be put out. Maligno.\"\n\nThe podesta turned to Daoud. \"But in this case we will be using it for a\ngood purpose. Messer David, do you love your organs of manhood?\"\n\n\"What are you saying to me?\" Daoud cried, determined that he would be\nDavid of Trebizond to the very end. His real terror now matched his\npretended terror, but he managed to keep them two separate feelings. The\nscream trying to escape him battered itself like a trapped animal\nagainst the inner wall of the Face of Steel.\n\nD'Ucello bent closer to Daoud, and from his painful position, belly\ndown, arms and legs stretched taut, Daoud lifted his head to look at the\npodesta. D'Ucello glowered at him, his lips tight under his thin\nmustache.\n\n\"I mean that if you do not tell me who you really are and what you are\ndoing in Orvieto, I will apply this healing potion to your male member.\nIt should not take more than a drop to burn away everything you have\nthere.\" D'Ucello feinted at Daoud's face with the flask, and Daoud\nflinched back and cried out. He strained desperately against the chains\nthat held him.\n\nGreek Fire--what a cruel turn of fate that a thing invented by Sophia's\npeople should destroy him. Grief swelled in his throat as he mourned the\nend of those hours of delight they had passed together.\n\nBut, Daoud thought, d'Ucello did not need Greek Fire to destroy his\nmanhood. He could burn it with oil and a torch, or he could order\nErculio to slash it away with a knife. The podesta had chosen Greek Fire\nbecause it was strange, hinted of magic--maligno. Daoud remembered what\nd'Ucello had said, an eon ago, when they were talking upstairs: that he\nwould prefer picking a lock to forcing it. Even now the podesta was\ntrying to use fear rather than pain to make Daoud tell him what he\nwanted to know. D'Ucello himself did not really relish inflicting\nphysical pain; he preferred to work on men's emotions.\n\nD'Ucello peered at him. \"Under the appearance of a helpless and\nterrified merchant, there is bravado. But now you know what a terrible\nthing is going to happen to you if you persist. I will give that\nunderstanding time to ripen.\"\n\nHe drew away and turned to Erculio. \"I will return at midday, after my\nmorning audiences. See that he thinks about what is going to happen to\nhim.\"\n\nErculio bowed. \"Signore.\"\n\nThe podesta left the dungeon, still holding the silver flask.\n\n_He has to put off carrying out his threat_, Daoud thought. _Once he has\npoured that Greek Fire on my loins, he has done his worst. If the fear\ndoes not force me to speak, the deed is pointless. After it is done I\nwill have little more to lose. If he were a true torturer, he would have\nbegun with my toes._\n\nEven so, Daoud was sure d'Ucello would carry out his threat.\n\n_Therefore, I must prepare myself for death._\n\nIf d'Ucello used the Greek Fire on him, Daoud would want Erculio to kill\nhim. And he was sure Erculio would do it.\n\nHe turned his mind again to thoughts of God. Soon he would be\nface-to-face with God in paradise.\n\nHe heard Erculio talking to the guards, making preparations for some new\ntorment. Rather than wallow in fear, Daoud visualized a fresh flood of\nSoma coursing through his heart and mind and limbs. Saadi had explained\nthat there was no limit to how much of a spiritual drug a man could\ntake.\n\nThis time, as Soma detached his spirit from his body, something happened\nto him unlike anything he had never known before. He was looking down at\nhimself. He saw himself lying facedown, nearly nude on the rack, his\nblond hair darkened and plastered down with sweat. He saw the bloody\nslashes across his back, the blackened burn mark on his leg.\n\nHe was floating near the ceiling of the dungeon. He looked down at the\nspider shape of Erculio, talking with the guards and the clerk. Amazing\nthat they did not look up here and see him. They thought he was still on\nthe rack.\n\nHe rose through solid stone, a space of lightlessness. Then he was\nmoving over tiled floors through the upper levels of the Palazzo del\nPodesta, and he was out through its iron-sheathed oak door.\n\nThe vault of the sky over him was as black and heavy as the stones of\nthe dungeon where his body lay. It must be the final hour of night. Even\nthough he was a spirit, he sensed that the air was hot and damp.\n\nHe rose higher and higher over Orvieto, and amazingly he was able to see\ndespite the absence of light. He could see the entire oval shape of the\ncity from end to end, and the deep valleys that surrounded it. There at\nthe west end was the cathedral of San Giovenale, with the great piazza\nwhere public events took place. There was Cardinal Ugolini's mansion,\nnear the palace where the pope had lived. On the north side of the town,\nthe Palazzo Monaldeschi, where he had hoped to end the threat to Islam\nwith swift blows of his dagger. And there--\n\nFrom such a height--and since it was not yet dawn--he should not have\nbeen able to recognize her, but he saw and knew at once the small figure\nof a cloaked and hooded woman striding purposefully through a twisting\nstreet. She was walking through the eastern side of the town, in the\ndirection of Tilia's house, which he could see from up here, with the\ndovecote on its roof and its crenellated balconies, though Sophia could\nnot. Beside Sophia, a hulking figure carried a torch to light their way.\nUgolini's man-at-arms Riccardo.\n\nWithout knowing how he did it, Daoud was down from the sky in an instant\nand walking invisibly beside her. Her black brows were drawn together in\na frown, her nose and mouth covered by a silk scarf. She looked almost\nlike a Muslim woman. She was full of fear for him, he knew. He wanted to\ntell her not to be afraid, but how could he, knowing he was going to\ndie?\n\nHe thanked God for letting him see Sophia one last time.\n\n_I love you, Sophia. Remember our joy._\n\n\n\n\nLII\n\n\nFighting billows of terror that threatened to engulf her, Sophia pulled\nher veil aside so that Tilia's servant Cassio could recognize her.\nYawning, Cassio led Sophia and Riccardo into the large, column-lined\nreception room and left them. Ugolini's man threw himself down on a\npadded bench. Sophia, too agitated to sit still, unpinned her hooded\ncloak and dropped it beside Riccardo. Even though she had just walked\nhalfway across town, she paced the carpeted floor, twisting her fingers.\n\nWould Tilia be able to help, or would she be as powerless as Ugolini?\nThis journey across the city might be utterly futile, but Sophia, unable\nto sleep and tormented by demon-inspired visions of what was happening\nto Daoud, had to do something.\n\nTilia quickly appeared on the landing of the second floor gallery,\nfollowed by Cassio, who held a candle. Despite her bulk, she seemed to\nflow down the stairs in her trailing red silk gown.\n\n\"Quickly, tell me what has happened,\" she said. \"For you to come this\nlate it must be disastroso.\" Her voice was calm but hoarse. Her face was\npuffy and creased with deep wrinkles. She wore one piece of jewelry, her\nbishop's cross.\n\n\"We had better talk alone,\" Sophia said. Tilia nodded. Riccardo was\nalready sitting on a couch in the entry hall with his eyes shut. Cassio\nlooked inquiringly at Tilia. His shoulder-length black hair, usually\nwell-combed and glossy, was a nest of unruly locks pointing every which\nway.\n\n\"Give me the candle, Cassio,\" said Tilia. \"Come up to my room, Sophia.\nYour escort can wait here.\" She sighed. \"A few weeks ago there would\nhave been clients waiting in this room even at this hour. Since the pope\nleft--\" She waved a hand at the emptiness of the great chamber.\n\nSophia felt herself wanting to cling to Tilia, as if the short, fat\nwoman were her mother. A few months before she had felt nothing but\nhatred for the brothel keeper because she had introduced Rachel into\nwhoredom. Now she prayed only that Tilia could help her.\n\nHer bedroom was cool, the shutters of a large double window having been\nswung open to let in the night air. Tilia sat on her wide bed, which was\ncovered with embroidered cushions and silk sheets that draped over the\nfour posts. Sophia went to the window and drew back the curtain to look\nout. The street outside was dark and empty.\n\nWhat was happening to Daoud in the Palazzo del Podesta? Were they\ncrippling his beautiful body? Was he dying? Dead? She felt like crying\nat the thought of how they might be hurting him. But she could not help\nhim unless she kept her head.\n\nSophia quickly told Tilia about Daoud's arrest. Tilia lay back on the\nbed, her beady eyes fixed on Sophia, and fingered the cross on her ample\nbosom. Every so often she nodded, as if this were just what she had\nexpected.\n\nShe covered her eyes momentarily with her hand. \"May God be kind to\nDaoud ibn Abdallah. He is worth ten of any ordinary men.\"\n\n_She knows Daoud's Muslim name!_\n\nBut Sophia had no time to pursue the thought. Tilia had quickly wiped\nher tears away and turned to Sophia expectantly.\n\n\"With Lorenzo away you are the only one who might be able to do\nsomething,\" Sophia said.\n\n\"What do you expect of me, if David lets himself be taken away and the\ncardinal does nothing?\" Tilia asked. \"Have I more power than they?\"\nClearly her use of \"Daoud\" was a momentary indiscretion.\n\n\"We need someone who can think,\" Sophia said, realizing how vague she\nsounded in her desperation.\n\n\"How is Adelberto taking it?\" Tilia asked.\n\n\"He is almost speechless with terror. He just moans and weeps and wrings\nhis hands. I am afraid he may try to run away, or confess everything or\ndo something equally foolish.\"\n\nTilia nodded again, grimly. \"He is picturing all the things they will do\nto him if he is found guilty of conspiring with the enemies of\nChristendom.\" She looked at Sophia keenly. \"What about you? Are you not\nafraid for yourself?\"\n\n\"I am dying of fear.\"\n\nTilia reached over and squeezed her hand. \"I am frightened too. Who\nwould not be? But you're right--giving way to panic just leaves us\nhelpless. Let us go back to Adelberto's mansion. He is a changeable man.\nI may be able to get him to think sensibly. I will see what I can do\nwith him.\"\n\nA wave of relief swept over Sophia. At least she was no longer\nstruggling alone.\n\nSophia could see a bluish light on the tile roofs of the houses across\nfrom Tilia's window. It would soon be morning.\n\n_God, they have had Daoud for a whole night! What have they done to\nhim?_\n\n\"D'Ucello has men watching the cardinal's mansion,\" Sophia said.\n\"Riccardo and I slipped out through the tunnel that leads under the\nstreet to the potterymaker's shop, but we cannot get back in that way.\"\n\n\"Getting there is the easiest part of it,\" said Tilia. \"Cassio will hire\na covered cart for us. The hard part will be deciding what to do once we\nhave arrived.\" She smiled and patted her breasts, accentuated by the\ngossamer fabric of her sleeping gown. \"I must put some clothes on.\"\n\n\"While you dress, can I see Rachel?\" Sophia asked. She noticed three\nironbound chests, ornamented with circular enameled medallions, standing\nin a row against the wall beside Tilia's bed. Each was secured with a\npadlock. They must hold the gold Tilia's customers brought to her.\n\n\"I will take you to Rachel,\" said Tilia. \"She is as well and happy as\nwhen you saw her last. But do not tell her what has happened to David.\"\n\n\"There is no point in frightening her,\" Sophia agreed. \"But when we\nleave Orvieto, I want to take her with us.\"\n\n\"Whether you believe it or not, I am looking after her welfare,\" Tilia\nsaid. \"Just yesterday, John the Tartar offered me five thousand florins\nto let him take her to Perugia with him when he follows the pope there.\nHe flew into a rage when I refused him. So, you see, I have even braved\nthe fury of the Tartars for Rachel's sake. Perhaps you will begin to\njudge me a little more kindly.\"\n\nTurning to leave the room, Sophia froze momentarily. It had not occurred\nto her that Tilia would know that she had once hated her. The woman\n_was_ penetrating. She felt a little more confident that Tilia would\nhave the wisdom to help her in this calamity.\n\nTilia, holding a candle, opened Rachel's door for Sophia. More\nglittering gold had been added to the girl's bedroom since Sophia had\nlast visited her, and when the candle flame illuminated it, the room\nseemed to blaze. Sophia blinked at the gold curtains before the windows\nand the heavy cloth-of-gold draperies surrounding the bed.\n\nAll this, she thought, was to impress that horrible Tartar who came\nhere to lie with Rachel. How lucky Sophia had been to be able to share\nher bed with a man she loved.\n\nBut thoughts of happiness with Daoud--memories--were like a knife in her\nheart, now that he had been taken from her.\n\nTilia pulled the drape aside, and there was Rachel, curled up nude on\ntop of yellow silk sheets. Her skinny arms and legs made her look even\nyounger than she was. Sophia felt heartsick as Rachel's eyes opened wide\nat the sudden light. She sat up in bed, dragging the sheet across her\nbody, then drew back against the wall. She looked terrified. Sophia\nwondered what sort of awakenings Rachel was used to in this place, and a\nsudden return of her rage at Tilia made her tremble.\n\n_Well and happy, is she?_\n\nBut she dared not be angry with Tilia now. Tilia was the only person who\ncould help her.\n\nRachel's black eyes fell on Sophia, and the fear went out of her face.\nIt was replaced by a glad smile that hurt Sophia's heart all the more.\n\n_I abandoned her to this, and yet she is happy to see me._\n\n\"I will leave you two to talk,\" Tilia said.\n\nSophia sat on the gold sheets and took Rachel's hand when Tilia was\ngone. For a moment she forgot her own grief and fear, as an urge to\ncomfort Rachel pushed to the fore.\n\n\"All of us are going to be leaving Orvieto soon, and when we do we will\ntake you with us,\" she said. Rachel's dark eyes glowed.\n\nSophia went on. \"Wherever we go, you will not have to stay with Tilia\nanymore and do--what Tilia expects of you. We will find a home for you.\"\n\nShe was not sure how she was going to keep such a promise, but she\ndecided that Daoud would have to kill her before she would let him put\nRachel in another brothel.\n\nAgain the knife in her breast as she remembered she might never see\nDaoud again.\n\nRachel shrugged. \"I may be better off doing this than I would be as some\nman's wife.\" She looked down at her hands, and Sophia saw that her\nfingers were long and slender and quite beautiful. \"John Chagan has made\nme very rich, you know.\"\n\nSophia thought of the three locked chests in Tilia's room. She would\nhave to make sure that Rachel, when she left this place of shame, got\nall the gold that was rightfully hers. And how outrageous, that Tilia\nhad been filling Rachel's head with lies about how lucky she was.\n\n\"Tilia and the others here have to believe that this is the right life\nfor them. But there is not a woman here who would not trade whatever\nriches she has earned for a real home, with a husband and children.\"\n\nRachel was silent a moment. Her face was all straight lines, Sophia saw,\nyet delicate and feminine at the same time.\n\n_As a woman, she will be much more beautiful than I._\n\n\"Even you?\" Rachel said suddenly.\n\nSophia was surprised. \"We are not talking about me. I am not--a\ncourtesan.\"\n\n\"What are you?\" Rachel asked softly, shyly.\n\n_What word is there to describe me?_\n\nShe had thought often about other women and how different their lives\nwere from hers. Sometimes, to survive, she had to give her body to men\nwhen she did not want to. She had been in danger of death. She had known\nlove and wealth and power. She had lived this way since her parents and\nthe boy she had loved were killed, and she could not imagine living any\nother way.\n\n\"I am just a person who does whatever she needs to,\" said Sophia. How\ncould she sit here and talk like this, when Daoud might be dying? A\nchill went over her, as if she were in the grip of a fever, and she\nalmost cried aloud.\n\n\"Something is wrong,\" Rachel said. \"Why are you here so early in the\nmorning?\" That look of terror was coming back into her face.\n\nThe door opened, and Tilia was there, dressed in a long green silk tunic\nand a yellow satin surcoat. Light was beginning to show through Rachel's\nwindows. Sophia held Rachel's hand for a moment and then let go of it\nand stood up to leave.\n\n\"Take me with you,\" Rachel said, seizing Sophia's wrist.\n\n\"Not now,\" said Sophia quickly. \"We will all be together when we leave\nOrvieto.\"\n\nRachel's eyes overflowed with tears. \"I do not want to stay here. I want\nto go with you now.\"\n\n\"What have you been saying to her?\" Tilia said angrily.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Sophia. She turned to Rachel. \"See, Madama will be angry\nwith me. She thinks I have been frightening you. Now show her that you\nare calm and are willing to stay here.\"\n\nRachel's thin shoulders slumped. \"As you wish, Signora.\"\n\nIn the midst of her fear for Daoud, a pang of guilt shot through Sophia.\nShe had upset Rachel and then spoken gruffly to her. She rushed to her\nand hugged the thin body against hers.\n\nShe kissed Rachel quickly and followed Tilia out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSophia followed Tilia through the door of Ugolini's cabinet after Tilia\nthrust it open without even knocking. Ugolini's eyes bulged at the sight\nof Tilia, and he threw down his pen.\n\nHe was still in a panic, Sophia saw, heartsick. Even if they could come\nup with a plan to rescue Daoud, would he be willing to do anything?\n\n\"Now, of all times, you should not be here,\" he cried at Tilia.\n\nWithout a word Tilia marched across the Syrian carpet, her broad hips\nswinging under her green gown. She went around Ugolini's desk and held\nout her arms to him. With a slightly embarrassed glance at Sophia, he\nstood up--he was the same height as Tilia--and let her take him into her\narms. He leaned his head on her shoulder for a moment, then handed her\ninto his chair.\n\n_They really are lovers_, thought Sophia, seeing the little cardinal's\nsudden wistful smile. The sight of that smile gave her new hope. Perhaps\nTilia could restore his courage. Only Ugolini had the power and\nauthority to do anything about Daoud's imprisonment. Tilia had to bring\nhim back to himself.\n\n\"Did you not want me to know, Adelberto, what happened to David?\" she\ndemanded, looking down at the parchment he had been writing on. \"What is\nthis?\"\n\n\"I am calculating my horoscope for this day. The stars are telling me I\nhave overreached myself and have only myself to blame for my downfall.\"\n\n\"For your downfall? Dear God, Adelberto, have you given up hope\nalready?\"\n\nHis words dimmed Sophia's hopes. He believed in his stars.\n\nUgolini, dressed in a white gown tied at the waist with a cord, walked\nto the half-open windows and pulled the violet drapes across them,\ndarkening the room. A breeze made the drapes billow inward and blew out\nthe flame of the candle on his desk, plunging the room into a deeper\ndarkness. Unbidden, Sophia picked up a wax taper from Ugolini's\nworktable, igniting it from the fat, hour-marked candle in the corner\naway from the window, and went lighting candles in the candelabra around\nthe room. Talking in the dark would only drive their spirits lower.\n\n_If only Lorenzo were here. He would have a plan by now, and be doing\nsomething about it._\n\nUgolini held out his hands to Tilia. \"I am doomed, and I do not want you\ndragged down with me.\" He turned to Sophia, whiskers bristling over his\ngrimace. \"You should have left her out of this.\"\n\n_If I had left her out of it, there would be no hope at all_, Sophia\nthought, sitting on the small chair facing Ugolini's worktable. She\nlooked with appeal at Tilia, who nodded reassuringly.\n\n\"Tilia needs just as much as any of us to know what is happening,\" said\nSophia. \"And you need to talk to her.\" Ugolini's hands were trembling,\nshe saw. She, too, was afraid, both for herself and Daoud. Fear was a\nblack hollow eating away at her insides.\n\n_Oh, Daoud, what are they doing to you?_\n\nHe might come out of the Palazzo del Podesta blind, or with arms or legs\ncut off, or mad, she thought. When she saw him again, she might wish him\ndead--and herself along with him.\n\nShe wiped the cold sweat from her brow with the hem of her silk cloak.\nIn the heavy, hot air, the scent of Tilia's rose-petal sachet filled the\nroom.\n\n\"Only a miracle can save us,\" said Ugolini, pacing and waving his hands.\n\"I have been praying to God that He take the soul of David of Trebizond\nbefore he breaks under torture and dooms us all.\"\n\nSophia reeled with the pain his words brought her. She wanted to claw\nUgolini's eyes out. She sprang up from her chair, fists clenched.\n\n\"May God take _your_ soul!\" she screamed at him. \"And send you straight\nto hell!\"\n\nUgolini turned and stared at her as if she had struck him.\n\n\"Be still, Sophia,\" said Tilia quietly. \"That will not help.\"\n\nPanting heavily, Sophia sat down again. They needed Ugolini so badly,\nand he was so _useless_. She wanted to weep with frustration.\n\n\"Of course God will damn me,\" Ugolini cried, throwing his arms into the\nair as he paced the room, his white gown rippling. \"Why should He spare\nme or any of us, when we have been working against His Church?\"\n\n_It is not my Church_, thought Sophia resentfully. _It is the schismatic\nLatin Church he speaks of._ Remembering that she was probably the only\nperson of her faith in Orvieto, she felt terribly alone.\n\n_Almost as alone as Daoud must feel._\n\n\"It seems that you no longer know who you are,\" said Tilia sourly to\nUgolini.\n\n\"Eh? What do you mean?\" He turned quickly and peered at her.\n\n_She talks to him as if she were his nursemaid_, Sophia thought. _And\nthat is what he needs._\n\n\"You are one of twenty-two men who _rule_ the Church,\" said Tilia\nfirmly. \"You will elect the next pope, and very soon, by all signs. You\nare not a citizen of Orvieto, subject to this podesta.\" She spat the\nword. \"You are one of the most powerful men in Italy.\"\n\n\"I am the creature of the Sultan of Egypt, and soon the whole world will\nknow it,\" Ugolini moaned. \"Oh, God, how I wish you had never come to me\nwith his bribes.\"\n\nSo it was Tilia who had recruited Ugolini for this work. There were\ndepths to this woman. If anyone could have an effect on Ugolini now, she\ncould. But Sophia wondered if even Tilia could reach the cardinal in his\npresent state.\n\n\"Are you sorry you met me, Adelberto?\" said Tilia softly.\n\n\"No, no!\" said Ugolini hastily.\n\nHe rushed over to where she sat at his table and put his hands on her\nshoulders.\n\n\"Without you,\" he said earnestly, \"my life would have been flat and\nempty.\"\n\n_Love_, thought Sophia. _He loves her. That might make the difference._\n\n\"And I helped you become wealthier than you ever dreamed possible. I\nhelped you buy the red hat.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Ugolini. \"But Fortune raises men high only so they may fall\nfarther when she casts them down.\"\n\nTilia brought her large hand down hard on Ugolini's marble-topped table.\n\"Enough of this talk of the stars and Fortune. Look here, Adelberto, for\nthis little cimice, this bedbug of a man, d'Ucello, to walk into the\nhouse of Cardinal Ugolini and arrest one of his guests--it is\ninsufferable! You must not permit it.\"\n\nSophia did not dare to breathe as she watched Ugolini's face for a sign\nof returning strength.\n\n\"No doubt you are right,\" said Ugolini, nodding slowly like a boy being\ntaught his lessons.\n\n\"You must bring pressure to bear on this man,\" Tilia went on. \"With most\nof the cardinals following the pope to Perugia, you are now even more\nimportant in Orvieto.\"\n\n_Thank God for Tilia._ At this moment Sophia was willing to forgive\nTilia even the corrupting of Rachel.\n\nUgolini said, \"Yes, but if last night I could not stop him from taking\nDavid, what can I do now?\" He spread his empty hands.\n\nAnother gust of wind lifted the purple drapes and sent scraps of\nparchment from Ugolini's table to the carpet. Sophia saw circles and\ntriangles and whole constellations flying across the room.\n\nThey would have to enlist the aid of someone who had influence over the\npodesta, Sophia thought, someone who was friendly enough to Ugolini to\nbe willing to speak on his behalf. With the pope gone, the most powerful\nperson in the city was--\n\nAs soon as the thought came to her, she spoke. \"The Contessa di\nMonaldeschi. Cardinal, you must go to her and ask her help.\"\n\nHer heart rose to her throat, choking her. Tilia and Ugolini stared at\nher. Would they listen? Would they spurn her idea?\n\n\"Why should _she_ help me?\" said Ugolini.\n\n\"She admires you,\" said Sophia. \"She told me so the night of the\nreception she gave for the Tartars. Now that the pope has left Orvieto,\nshe probably feels neglected.\"\n\nWide-eyed, Ugolini shook his head. \"But David is accused of involvement\nin the attack on her palace. Just yesterday I saw her cackling like a\nstrega while her men chopped off Marco di Filippeschi's head and\nmurdered half his family. They even impaled a baby on a spear, and she\nshouted with glee.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with us,\" said Sophia, though the image revolted\nher. \"She has no reason to connect David with the Filippeschi.\"\n\nTilia nodded vigorously, shaking her body and the chair she was sitting\nin. \"Sophia has an excellent idea, Adelberto. If the Contessa di\nMonaldeschi pleads for David, if _she_, the injured party, is convinced\nof his innocence, the podesta must yield.\"\n\nSophia felt more confident as she saw that Tilia was on her side. She\npressed the attack.\n\n\"Again and again d'Ucello has shown that he does whatever the\nMonaldeschi expect of him,\" she urged.\n\n\"He used to do whatever _either_ family expected of him,\" said Ugolini.\n\"Until so many Filippeschi perished that they ceased to matter.\"\n\nUgolini went to the window. A blast of hot, damp wind roared into the\nroom, and he raised his hand protectively in front of his face.\n\n\"It will storm soon,\" said Tilia. \"It cannot be soon enough to suit me.\nA storm will break this terrible heat. As soon as the storm passes, you\nmust go to her.\"\n\nUgolini nodded slowly. \"If I fail to convince her, I will be no worse\noff than I am now.\"\n\n\"You will convince her,\" said Tilia. \"You might as well start to put on\nyour red robes.\"\n\nReal hope sailed across the sea of terror to Sophia now, and it was a\ngalley, a galley with sails painted a cardinal's red. She felt it\nbearing her up over her dread for Daoud and for herself.\n\n\"I will go to the contessa with you,\" said Sophia. If he gave way to\npanic again, she could stop him from doing too much damage.\n\n\"And I will return to my house,\" said Tilia, standing up.\n\n\"No,\" said Ugolini. \"It was dangerous enough for you to come here. We\nknow this mansion is being watched. Stay here until nightfall.\"\n\nTilia smiled, went to him, and held his small, pointed face between her\nhands. \"I will stay. And if you succeed in persuading the contessa to\nhave David freed, we will have something to celebrate, you and I.\"\n\nTo celebrate! What a wonderful thought. Sophia had begun to feel she\nwould never celebrate anything again.\n\nBut moving Ugolini to act was only the first step, she reminded herself.\nThe contessa might prove to be against them, and Daoud might still be\ndoomed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSophia watched, eaten up by anxiety, as the Contessa di Monaldeschi\nadvanced slowly into her smaller audience chamber, leaning on her\ngrandnephew, a plump boy in red velvet.\n\n\"I hope you have not come to scold me, Cardinal Ugolini,\" the contessa\nrasped.\n\nCould this old woman really have laughed to see a baby impaled on a\nspear, Sophia wondered as she and Ugolini bowed.\n\n\"Dear Contessa, scold you?\" Ugolini said with a chuckle. \"Whatever for?\"\nSophia was delighted to see how completely he had, to all outward\nappearances, cast off the terror that gripped him a short time before.\n\n_Like all of us, when terror strikes, he needs to feel he can do\nsomething._\n\n\"Ah, Cardinal. Surely you know.\" When she reached Ugolini, the tall,\nbony old woman clutched at the boy's arm with both clawlike hands and\nbegan, with an effort that made her compress her withered lips, to lower\nherself to the floor. It hurt Sophia just to watch her struggle to\ngenuflect before the cardinal.\n\nThe contessa had aged a great deal, Sophia thought, since she first saw\nher, over a year ago. She was thinner, more bent, moved with much\ngreater difficulty. Ugolini reached out to try to stop her from\nkneeling.\n\n\"Please, Dona Elvira!\" he cried. \"Do not trouble yourself so.\"\n\n\"No, I am a good daughter of the Church,\" said the contessa. \"And\nthrough you I pay homage to God.\"\n\nThe old woman's maroon satin gown crackled as she bent her knees. Even\nkneeling, she was almost as tall as Ugolini. Gold bracelets rattled\naround her skinny arms, and heavy medallions dangled from gold chains\naround her neck. A net of gold threads held the coiled braids of her\nwhite hair in place.\n\nOnce she was on her knees, her grandnephew pulled off his red cap and\nbowed to Ugolini with a sweeping gesture. His hair was a mass of tight\nblack curls. Had he, too, watched the massacre of the Filippeschi,\nSophia wondered. And what had that done to the boy?\n\n\"Please let me kiss your ring,\" the contessa said. She seized his hand\nand planted a loud, smacking kiss on his sapphire cardinal's ring.\n\n\"It is I who should pay homage to you, Dona Elvira,\" said Ugolini.\n\nSophia immediately stepped forward to help the contessa struggle to her\nfeet. The boy took the old lady from the other side. Sophia caught a\nglimpse of him looking at her with bright, amused eyes. Eyes that were\ntoo old for the face of an eleven-year-old boy.\n\nWhen she got close to the contessa, Sophia smelled an odor that made her\nthink of a damp cellar. Together Sophia and the Monaldeschi heir walked\nwith the old lady to a broad-armed chair, where she settled herself,\ngasping. Two manservants set smaller chairs for the cardinal and Sophia\nfacing the contessa.\n\nThe contessa's grandnephew leaned elegantly against the back of the old\nlady's chair, the fingers of his chubby hands interlinked. Sophia\nglanced at him and caught his glittering eyes roving over her body. He\nsaw her looking at him, and smiled faintly and without embarrassment.\n\nContessa Elvira raised a trembling hand. \"Cardinal Piacenza had been\nmost unkind. I had a letter from him this morning condemning me in the\nrudest terms for our triumph over the Filippeschi canaglia yesterday in\nthe Piazza San Giovenale. He accused me of sacrilege, because I shed the\nblood of Marco during a Mass. When else could I have taken him and his\nfoul brood unawares? God gave me the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Nothing happens save by the will of God,\" Ugolini murmured.\n\n\"Esattamente! Yet Cardinal Piacenza has the audacity to tell me that I\nam in a grave state of sin and that I have led Vittorio here into sin as\nwell.\"\n\nGlancing again at Vittorio, Sophia noticed the sword, short enough for a\nboy but long enough to kill, that hung from his jeweled belt.\n\nUgolini shook his head. \"No one has the right to say that another is in\nsin. Only God sees the soul. _Judge not, lest ye be judged._\"\n\nSophia found it hard to believe that this was the same man whose panic\nshe had struggled to overcome a few hours earlier. He was suddenly the\nperfect clergyman, attentive, sympathetic, sententious.\n\n\"Yes, and for what should I be judged?\" The contessa lifted both hands\nnow. \"For exacting justice?\"\n\n\"If you have any doubts, dear Madama,\" Ugolini said, \"I will be happy to\ngive you absolution.\"\n\nThat was a nice touch, thought Sophia. If she confessed to him, that\nwould certainly put her under his influence.\n\nBut even as they talked, across town the podesta's men might be tearing\nDaoud's body to pieces. Sophia felt her stomach knot. She shook her head\nas vigorously as she dared, to drive away the hideous images without\nattracting attention to herself.\n\n_Hurry! Dear God, make them hurry!_\n\n\"I _have_ no doubts,\" said the old lady firmly. \"Besides, I have my own\nchaplain. I would not wish another person on earth to know me as well as\nhe does. But I do thank you for your kind thought, Cardinal. I am glad\nto see that not all the princes of the Church think alike in this\nmatter.\"\n\n\"I am sure Cardinal Piacenza is quite alone,\" said Ugolini.\n\nThe contessa shrugged. \"I do not know about that. Since His Holiness\nleft, no one has called on me. I have been feeling quite abandoned.\"\n\nNow Sophia began to feel a stronger hope than ever. The old lady liked\nto be flattered by princes of the Church. Perhaps she could be won over\nafter all.\n\n\"Surely your guest, Cardinal de Verceuil, attends you often,\" Ugolini\nventured.\n\nThe contessa sniffed. \"That Frenchman. He is no more civilized than his\nTartars. I would rather he left me alone. The French are all rather\nbarbaric. Of course, that fine young Simon de Gobignon--he is most\nattractive.\" She grinned with a lasciviousness that startled Sophia.\n\"This palace has not been the same since he went back to France.\"\n\n\"Back to France?\" Ugolini stared. \"I thought he, too, was going to\nPerugia.\"\n\nSophia felt a ball of ice suddenly encase her heart. She had told\nUgolini, as she told Daoud, that Simon was going to Perugia. She prayed\nUgolini would not suspect that she had been lying.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the contessa. \"France. He told me himself when he took\nleave of me. And when he returns, I think Ghibellini everywhere in Italy\nwill have reason to tremble. Because the might of France will follow\nhim. I am only sorry he will not come in time to save Orvieto from the\nSienese. One of my sergentes just reported that the Sienese army is but\na day or two away from here.\"\n\n_And Lorenzo with it_, thought Sophia. _If only he would hurry._\n\n\"What will you do, Contessa?\" Ugolini asked. \"As a Guelfo family, do the\nMonaldeschi intend to leave Orvieto before the Sienese arrive?\"\n\nHe was straying from the subject, thought Sophia impatiently.\n\n_Never mind the damned Sienese army. They cannot do us any good._\n\nThe old lady tossed her head, her hooked nose jutting defiantly. She\nlaid her hand on Vittorio's.\n\n\"We will stand fast. This family has lived in this city since the days\nof the Etruscans. I expect our militia to put up a good fight. After our\nhonor has been satisfied, we will ask, with dignity, for terms.\"\n\n\"Very brave,\" said Ugolini.\n\nThe militia of Orvieto, thought Sophia, was under the command of the\npodesta. If d'Ucello was involved in fighting the Sienese, what might\nthat mean for Daoud?\n\nDona Elvira looked at the cardinal slyly. \"Are you also staying in\nOrvieto, Your Eminence?\"\n\n\"For the moment,\" said Ugolini.\n\nSophia was surprised that Ugolini did not say more, but the conversation\nseemed to be going the way he wanted it to.\n\n\"You may be able to help us, Your Eminence.\"\n\nSophia felt more elated than ever. If she wanted help from Ugolini, then\nsurely she would be willing to help him.\n\n\"Nothing would please me more, Contessa.\"\n\n\"You are from the south, from Manfred's kingdom. You might have some\ninfluence with these Ghibellini. Perhaps a word from you would help to\nkeep our house and our property intact.\"\n\nUgolini threw out his arms. \"Dear Contessa, anything. Of course, as a\nloyal supporter of the pope I do not ordinarily have dealings with\nGhibellini.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" the contessa agreed. Vittorio smiled. He had a small,\nchiseled mouth, such as Sophia had seen on the men in ancient Roman\nsculptures.\n\n\"But whatever little I might be able to do, I am entirely at your\nservice,\" Ugolini said.\n\n\"I have always considered you my very good friend, Your Eminence. Even\nthough you opposed the alliance of Christians and Tartars and they were\nmy houseguests.\"\n\nThat startled Sophia. The contessa made it sound as if the Tartars had\nleft her home.\n\n\"_Were_ your houseguests, Madama?\" Ugolini asked. So, he had noticed it\ntoo.\n\nShe sighed. \"Yes, they and that boorish French cardinal left for Perugia\nthis morning, not long before you came. They chose a bad day to leave.\nThis morning's storm is not the end of the rain. Another storm is\ncoming. Every joint in my body aches.\"\n\n\"These storms clear the air,\" said Ugolini.\n\nThe contessa held up a sticklike finger. \"Exactly as the storm yesterday\nin the Piazza San Giovenale did.\"\n\nNow she was bringing up her grievance, Sophia thought. Evidently she had\noffended a number of cardinals with the massacre of the Filippeschi.\n\nA servant brought a small table of some shiny black wood and set it in\ntheir midst. Its legs were carved in the form of twisting, wingless\ndragons. Perhaps it was a gift to the contessa from the Tartars. Sophia\nhad seen such furnishings in Constantinople and knew they came from the\ndistant East, where the Tartars ruled.\n\nAnother servant brought a tray with small sweet cakes filled with a\npaste made of crushed white raisins. A third poured the pale yellow wine\nof Orvieto into silver goblets for them. Sophia sipped her wine, but her\nstomach churned with fear for Daoud, a fear held rigidly in check. She\ncould not drink much, and she could not eat at all.\n\nEvery so often she glanced at Vittorio di Monaldeschi, and each time she\ndid, she found his eyes fixed on her.\n\nUgolini wiped his mouth after finishing off a cake. \"As Fortune's wheel\nturns, all of us need friends at one time or another.\"\n\n\"How true,\" said the old lady.\n\n\"I come before you today to presume upon our friendship to ask you a\nfavor, Madama,\" said Ugolini.\n\n\"We need each other, as you have said, Your Eminence.\"\n\nSophia prayed that the contessa would agree to help.\n\nUgolini told how the podesta's men had arrested Daoud the previous\nnight. Sophia watched the contessa's face for some sign of sympathy, but\nthe old lady remained as expressionless as a bird.\n\n\"I am shocked that the podesta would arrest your houseguest,\" she said.\n\"But what can I do? After all, Signore d'Ucello holds the office because\nhe has our confidence.\"\n\n_Which means that he stands aside while you murder your enemies._\n\nUgolini spread his hands. \"Precisely because he has your confidence,\ndear Madonna, I know he will listen to you. We have had no word of what\nhas become of our guest and friend.\"\n\n\"I want _everyone_ punished who had anything to do with the attack on my\npalace,\" said the contessa, clenching her bony fist.\n\nAnd what if the contessa were to discover that the man they were talking\nabout had incited that attack and used it as cover for his own attempt\nto murder the Tartar ambassadors, Sophia thought. She would want him\ntorn to bits in the piazza. New waves of terror washed over her.\n\nAnd she would want those who helped him punished along with him. Sophia\nglanced at Ugolini and saw that he was sweating.\n\n_Dear God, do not let him falter now._\n\n\"Of course, Contessa,\" he said. \"That is why I have come to you. Because\nyou, and not the podesta, are the one truly injured. But the arrest of\nDavid is a terrible mistake. I place before you my belief in this man's\nabsolute innocence. I am prepared to swear to it. He was not even here\nin Orvieto when that dastardly attack occurred. He was in Perugia. There\nare countless witnesses. I know this man. He is a _good_ man, a\nmerchant, not a warrior.\"\n\n\"I remember him,\" said the contessa. \"A very good-looking blond man. I\nheard his conversation with the Tartars and I began to wonder myself\nabout the wisdom of allying ourselves with them.\"\n\n\"It is probably because David did testify against the Tartars that the\npodesta thinks he might be connected with the attack on your palace,\"\nsaid Ugolini. \"But such a man as David would have nothing to do with\nsuch mascalzoni as the Filippeschi. I, too, have opposed the alliance,\nand yet you and I are friends. It is one thing to disagree in a\ncivilized way. It is another to turn to behave like a scoundrel. David\nhas the same horror of murder that we all do.\"\n\nRemembering what she had heard about the killings in the cathedral\nplaza, Sophia wondered if the contessa had any horror of murder at all.\n\n\"I am sure that is true,\" said the contessa. \"But the podesta must have\ngood reason for detaining this David.\"\n\nDespair overwhelmed Sophia. The tears that had been falling in her soul\nsprang to her eyelids and began to run down her cheeks. She should not\nshow her feelings like this, she thought. But what did it matter, when\nDaoud was dying and no one would lift a hand to save him?\n\n\"Why are you crying, child?\" said the contessa. Sophia heard sympathy in\nher voice.\n\n\"Forgive me, Contessa,\" she said, sobbing. \"This is very rude of me.\"\n\n\"Does this man mean so much to you?\" asked the old lady, her rasping\nvoice softened.\n\nIn her anguish, Sophia was still clear-headed enough to see that she\nmight use that anguish. She threw herself down on the terrazzo floor and\nclasped the contessa around the knees.\n\n\"Sophia!\" She could hear Ugolini's chair scrape as he stood up. The boy\ntook a step toward her.\n\n\"It is all right,\" said the contessa. \"You love this man, do you not?\"\nShe patted Sophia's hair.\n\n\"Yes,\" Sophia wept. \"And I swear to you, he is innocent.\"\n\n_He is, too, because he believes that everything he is doing is right._\n\n\"Your Eminence?\" said the contessa. \"You approve of your niece and this\nman from Trebizond?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Ugolini waving his hands. \"He is a fine man.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" said the old lady. \"That night at my reception I thought you and\nthe young Count de Gobignon were attracted to each other.\"\n\nSophia felt a strange stab of guilt.\n\n\"Oh, he is too far above me, Contessa,\" she said. \"A count. David is a\nmerchant. We are right for each other.\"\n\n_It is true that David and I are much more suited than Simon and I._\n\n\"It makes me feel young for a moment to see a beautiful woman in love.\"\nThe contessa stroked Sophia's cheek with dry, rough fingers.\n\nSophia opened her eyes wide and looked the contessa full in the face.\n\"Please help us, Contessa, for the sake of love.\"\n\nThe contessa sighed and smiled. \"I will send for d'Ucello. I will\nrequest that he stop questioning your friend.\" She looked across at\nUgolini. \"You must give me your word, Your Eminence, that this David\nwill not leave Orvieto until all doubts about him are settled.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you!\" Sophia kissed the shiny knuckles, wetting\nthe blue-veined hand with her tears.\n\n\"Sophia, stand up,\" said Ugolini, touching her shoulder. \"This is\nembarrassing.\"\n\nVittorio helped her to her feet, holding her waist more tightly than was\nnecessary.\n\n_Embarrassing? If not for my outburst, there would be no hope of freeing\nDaoud._\n\n_But I must live in terror awhile longer. Until I know he is well. That\nthey have not done anything to him. Oh, God, let him come back to me\nhealthy and whole._\n\n\n\n\nLIII\n\n\nRachel sat on a divan by the window in her room. She had drawn the\ncurtains back and pushed the shutters open so that she could see out and\nfeel the cool breeze. She held a small leather-bound book in her hand,\n_Geography of the World_, by Yucaf ibn Faruzi, a Spanish Jew. It was one\nof the small store of books Angelo had owned, written in Hebrew, that\nshe had kept with her to help her pass the long hours she spent alone.\nBesides enjoying reading, she felt she was somehow pleasing Angelo, who\nhad taught her to read Hebrew.\n\nShe was reading about Egypt when the second storm of the morning struck\nOrvieto and the window no longer admitted enough light to read by. A few\nwater droplets blew in through the open window to fall on the open\npages. She carefully blotted them up with the hem of her satin robe, but\nshe was afraid more rain would damage the vellum pages. So she shut the\nbook, and watched the lightning flash and listened to the thunder.\n\nTilia's house was built halfway down an incline, so Sophia could see\nwater foaming in the ditch that ran through the center of the street. So\nheavy was the rain that waves were flowing down the cobblestones. Where\na raindrop struck the water, the splash was like a little crown.\n\nA dark shadow appeared at the high end of the street, a hooded figure.\nAnother followed, and another. They rose higher and higher, until she\ncould see that they were riding horses. What were men doing out in a\nstorm like this? Were they coming here?\n\nThey were. The first men reined up their horses outside Tilia's front\ndoor, dismounted, and moved to the shelter of the overhanging houses\nacross the street. More men on horses, some on mules, and many more on\nfoot, gathered outside the house. All wore hoods or broad-brimmed hats\nto keep the rain from their heads. Rachel's heart began to thud in her\nchest when she saw there were too many for her to count. She saw the\ngleam of helmets under some of the hoods, the wet glitter of mail when\nan arm or leg emerged from a cloak. A train of mules carrying heavy\npacks came down the street and stopped.\n\nRachel began to tremble. These men had not come for pleasure. There were\ntoo many of them, and their dress and manner was full of menace. She was\nglad that the heavy rain forced them to keep their heads down;\notherwise, one of them might have looked up here and seen her. She drew\nback a little from the window.\n\nA line of covered carts drawn by pairs of mules pulled up behind the\ncrowd of armed men. The cart in the lead was bright yellow and red, and\nits paint glistened wetly.\n\nDid anyone else in the house know this crowd was out there? Perhaps no\none else was looking out a window. She ran to the door of her room, just\nas she heard a pounding from below.\n\nThen there were shouts, bangs, and crashes, the shrill shattering of\nglass and porcelain, the heavy thumps of bodies falling. Rachel opened\nher door. Other doors swung open along the shadowy third-floor corridor.\nSomeone stepped out with a candle. Frightened women's faces were white\nin the candlelight. She saw Antonia, Angela, Gloria.\n\nShe did not see Tilia. She must still be with Sophia, wherever they had\ngone this morning.\n\n_Oh, if only Sophia had taken me with her as I begged her to. I knew\nsomething terrible was going to happen._\n\n\"What is it?\" the women cried to one another. \"Who is down there? Wounds\nof Jesus!\"\n\nCassio emerged from Francesca's room, tying the drawstring of his hose.\nHe was a big man, his bare chest matted with black hair, and the sight\nof him comforted Rachel until she looked into his face as he hurried\npast her and saw that it was tight and pale with fear. And he was\ncarrying a naked shortsword.\n\nBut Cassio's appearance emboldened the women, and they left their rooms\nto crowd toward the top of the stairs that led to the lower floors.\nRachel joined them.\n\n\"I saw a lot of men outside,\" Rachel told the others, her heart\nbattering against her breastbone. \"Armed men, with horses and mules and\nwagons.\"\n\nAntonia, a round-faced woman, hair dyed red with henna, pulled her robe\naround her. \"Another party setting out for Perugia, I suppose. They\nprobably stopped by for a little farewell fun.\"\n\n\"Then why are they fighting downstairs?\" Francesca said, anxiety\nsharpening her voice.\n\nThunder shook the house, drowning out the clamor of the brawling two\nstories below. Then Rachel heard the clang of steel and Cassio's voice\ncrying out angrily.\n\nThe carpeted stairs at the end of the corridor shook under heavy feet.\nWomen's screams, mingled with the cries of men, arose on the lower\nfloors. She pushed her way to the head of the stairs and looked down.\n\nA group of men were coming up. They had thrown back the hoods of their\nbrown cloaks, and their pointed helmets reflected the candlelight.\nRachel backed away as she saw that the half-dozen men with helmets were\nbrandishing long broad-bladed daggers.\n\nThe women around her started screaming and darting back into their\nrooms. Rachel bolted for her own room.\n\n\"Rei-cho!\" The man's shrill cry shot an arrow of terror through her.\nThat was John's voice.\n\nShe turned in the doorway of her room and saw the Tartar standing at the\nhead of the stairs, his soft black cap hiding most of his white hair.\nBeside him was a stocky, middle-aged woman, and flanking them were the\nswarthy men with their daggers. John and the other men were all smiling,\nas if, as Antonia had said, they had come only for a bit of pleasure.\nBut the tumult downstairs, shaking the house more than the thunder,\nbelied that.\n\nJohn spoke to the woman and she called to Rachel. \"Signore John must go\nto Perugia.\" Her Italian was strangely accented. \"He wishes you to come\nwith him. He will give you many costly gifts.\"\n\nRachel took a step backward into her room. \"No. I do not want to go.\"\n\nNot now. Not when Sophia had just come to tell her they were going to\ntake her south with them. South to Manfred's kingdom, where Jews were\ntreated like everyone else. Where she might yet find a place for herself\nand forget that she had sold her body.\n\nJohn and the woman advanced down the corridor, their guards with them.\nSome of the swarthy men pushed open the doors of the rooms they passed\nand looked in. The doors could not be barred from the inside. Tilia had\nalways insisted on that, so no client could lock himself in with a woman\nand harm her. The men with the daggers grinned at one another and talked\nin a strange language.\n\n\"No, I don't want to go!\" Rachel screamed. She darted into her room and\nslammed the door. Frantically, she looked around for something to hold\nit shut.\n\nThe door started to open, and she threw herself against it. It closed\nfor a moment. Then she was hurled away from it as it swung inward, John\nbehind it. She screamed in fear.\n\nThe Tartar, who was not much taller than Rachel, strode into the room.\nHe walked with what appeared to be a swagger because he was slightly\nbowlegged. He was talking rapidly in his language, advancing on Rachel\nand smiling. He held out his arms. The stout woman stood in the doorway,\nwatching without expression.\n\nRachel backed away from them, her body rigid.\n\n\"You must come with him now. He is in a great hurry. An army of the\npope's enemies is less that a day from Orvieto, and they want to take\nSignore John and Signore Philip prisoner.\"\n\n\"Then let him escape,\" Rachel cried. \"I do not want to go with him.\" She\nwas standing before her bed now. The woman spoke to John and he answered\nquickly, still smiling.\n\n\"He says you are precious to him and he cannot leave you,\" she said\ntonelessly.\n\nShe had to get away now, or be John's prisoner for the rest of her life.\n\nPanting more from fury than from exertion, Rachel made a sudden jump to\nher right, and when John stepped in that direction to grab her, she\ndarted to the left and ran out the door. John's translator made no\neffort to stop her.\n\n_That would not have fooled him, except that he was not expecting me to\ndo anything_, she thought as she ran down the corridor.\n\nShe held one thought in her mind--she must get out of this building. She\nheard screams and sounds of struggle from the rooms of the other women.\nShe saw Francesca fighting with a helmeted man, and her eyes met\nFrancesca's over the man's brown-cloaked shoulder. Only one of the\ndagger-wielding men was in the corridor now, and she had surprised him.\nHe shouted at her and ran after her.\n\nGathering up the skirt of her robe, she raced down the stairs, taking\nthe last four in a leap. The dark man with the dagger was right behind\nher, and behind him she could hear John's shout. There was anger in the\nTartar's voice now. That terrified her even more.\n\n_He did not think I would get away from him this easily._\n\nThe dark man grabbed her flying robe, and she felt the silk tear. She\nhad nothing on underneath the robe. She would not let that stop her from\nrunning. She must not let anything stop her.\n\nShe heard the man behind her calling as she ran down the stairs to the\nfirst floor. She was in the corridor now, and she saw that it was\nswarming with men in helmets and mail, struggling with Tilia's women.\nSome of the men had their breeches down.\n\nShe saw tall, beautiful Maiga striking out with her fists at the\nhelmeted men. But they were wrestling with her and forcing her onto her\nback. Agonized pity for Maiga blazed up within her, but she ran on.\n\nOne of Tilia's black African servants was lying on the floor across the\ncorridor. His eyes were open and he was not moving. Again she felt a\nsurge of pity.\n\nBut then terror gripped her.\n\n_They are killing people here! My God, what are they doing, what are\nthey doing?_\n\nInstead of going on down the stairs from the first floor gallery to the\nground floor, she leapt over the body of the black man and ran into the\ncrowd of men and women struggling in the hall.\n\n_I am small and I am quick_, she thought, and that gave her the courage\nto keep running. The men in the hall were not interested in her, and she\nslithered past them while John and his bodyguard stumbled along behind.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice sounded far away. Other men were shouting at him.\n\n\"Catch her yourself, you damned Armenian ape!\" These men were speaking\nin Italian. \"We've already got ours.\"\n\nRachel reached the stairs at the other end of the corridor. They led\ndown to the same place as did the main stairs, the reception room on the\nground floor. But her pursuers would not know that. Sure enough, they\nwere following her through this first-floor corridor. She glanced back\nand saw that the crowd of Italian men had gotten in their way, so that\nhalf the corridor was between them.\n\n_Run, Rachel!_\n\nFrantically she ran down to the first floor. There, horror greeted her.\nMore of Tilia's black men--she could not count--were sprawled around the\nreception hall.\n\nShe saw blood spattered over the frescoes. She saw a black arm lying by\nitself. One body had no head. She heard a scream of horror and knew it\nwas her own voice. Why were they doing this? What devils drove them?\nThere was blood all over the floor. Puddles of it. She had to dart\naround them, over them.\n\nTerror streaked through her as a tall man blocked her path. His hood was\nthrown back and his cloak was open, and a jeweled cross glittered on his\nchest--like the one Tilia wore, only three times bigger. Their eyes met;\nhis were staring and full of rage. His nose was big, and his mouth was\nsmall and cruel. He pointed a long finger at her, a fortune in jeweled\nrings glittering on his gloved hand.\n\n\"You! The one we came for! Stop!\"\n\nShe stood paralyzed as a recollection of the dread face before her\nflashed into her mind. Dinners for John and Philip--Tilia had given\nelegant dinners, three or four of them--with musicians and the\ncompanionship of her ladies, Rachel included.\n\nAnd this was how they repaid her courtesy.\n\nThis man had been a guest at those dinners. He was a man of very high\nrank, a cardinal in the Christian Church. He was French, she remembered.\nHis Italian words were heavily accented.\n\n_What will they do to me if I don't obey him? Will they burn me for\nbeing a Jew?_\n\nAnd there was the other Tartar, Philip, standing beside the French\nchurchman. He looked like John--round head, brown skin, slitted\neyes--except that his beard and mustache were black. He was carrying a\nbow in one hand and had a quiver full of arrows slung over one shoulder.\nRachel froze, like a rabbit trapped by two wolves.\n\nThe tall Frenchman reached for Rachel--but another figure appeared\nbetween them, one of Tilia's black men. He blocked the tall man with the\ncross, giving Rachel a chance to jump for the door.\n\nOut of the corner of her eye Rachel saw Philip, strong white teeth\ngleaming in a brown face, raise his bow. She heard the thrum of the\nstring, and then a piercing scream. Anguish for the black man welled up\nin her.\n\nHer torn robe was flapping as she ran out the door. She almost fell as\nsomeone seized the back of her robe and yanked on it. She twisted out of\nthe robe and ran on, naked.\n\nShe heard John's shrill voice. He had reached the ground floor.\n\nShe was out of the house. In an instant her bare body was rain-wet from\nhead to toe.\n\nA group of big men holding horses stood across the street, under the\noverhang of the house opposite Tilia's. They were wearing swords and\npurple surcoats over mail shirts. They looked at her gloomily and made\nno move to stop her.\n\nShe had no idea where to go, but downhill was the easiest direction.\nMaybe hide in an alley. Knock on a door and beg for help. Try to get\nacross town to Sophia.\n\nAnywhere, if only she could get away from John.\n\nMany times she had nightmares of running from something that was trying\nto kill her. Sometimes a monster or a demon. Sometimes from crowds of\nroaring people carrying torches. Always in those dreams she could not\nmake her legs move. It was like trying to run through water. Always she\ntried to scream for help and no sound would come from her throat but a\nwhisper.\n\nNow she was able to run full speed away from that house where death and\ndestruction were running riot. And running as fast as she could was not\nenough! It would not get her away fast enough from John and his armed\nmen and that horrible cardinal. She was able to scream at the top of her\nlungs, but to no avail. Nobody would come to rescue her. Nobody would\nhelp her.\n\nShe had also had nightmares about running through the street naked, with\nhundreds of people watching. In those dreams she had been horribly\nembarrassed. Now she was really doing it, and she did not care about her\nnakedness.\n\nShe darted past the carts and the horses and mules and their drivers\nthat filled the street from side to side. She was running naked and\nbarefoot over the cobblestones.\n\nShe ran past the red and yellow cart at the head of the line of wagons\nand saw sitting beside the driver a man with a full white beard. He was\nlooking down at her. For a moment she thought he was a rabbi. Then she\nsaw his shaven scalp and brown robe. One of those Christian begging\nmonks. He opened his mouth to say something to her, but she was past him\nalready.\n\nShe heard hoofbeats behind her, and gooseflesh broke out all over her\nnaked body.\n\n_Dear God, is he chasing me on horseback?_\n\nBut she could dart into a quintana, the space between two houses. It\nwould be too narrow for a man on horseback to follow her. She saw an\nopening on her left and made for it, begging God to help her run faster.\n\nShe felt something whip around her body, tearing her skin. She was\njerked off her feet. She fell on her back on the wet cobblestones. She\nlay helpless, stunned and gasping for air. A rope was cutting into her\nchest just below her breasts, pinning her arms above the elbows to her\nsides. The rope burned her. Her back felt scraped and bruised. She saw a\nhorse's legs beside her. John was grinning down at her, holding the\nother end of the rope. The rain pouring down in her face stung her eyes.\n\nNow that she knew she was caught and helpless, her terror was transmuted\ninto rage. What right had he to treat her this way?\n\n\"May God strike you dead!\" she spat. He might not know the words, but\nshe was sure he could hear the hatred in her voice.\n\nHe tugged on the rope to make her climb to her feet. She felt she would\nrather lie there and make him drag her, if he wanted her so badly, but\nshe realized that would only hurt her worse.\n\nShe took a grip on the rope to haul herself up. The cold rain beat down,\nplastering her hair to her head. She wanted to wipe her face, but her\narms were pinioned. Her back felt as if it were on fire.\n\nShe looked at Tilia's house and saw that a man's body was swinging,\nsodden and limp, above the door.\n\nHer stomach turning at the sight, she recognized Cassio's features in\nthe swollen, blackened face. They had hanged him from Tilia's\ncrenellated balcony. And she had always thought he was such a big, tough\nman. She felt a stab of pity for him, even though he had never been\nespecially nice to her.\n\nHer heart grew heavier and colder in her chest as the horror sank in.\nThese men had destroyed Tilia's house, killed the men and raped the\nwomen with the gleeful cruelty of small boys stoning a bird's nest.\n\nAnother jerk on the rope started her walking back up the street. She\nkept her eyes down to avoid the sight of Cassio's body.\n\nAs they passed the yellow cart, a voice called out to the Tartar, and he\nanswered briefly in what seemed to be his own language. Again the voice,\nand there was command in the tone. John reined his horse to a stop.\n\nApprehension filled her. What new indignity would she have to suffer?\n\nVery slowly, the brown-robed Christian priest climbed down from the\ncart. He pulled his hood up against the rain. Rachel put one hand\nbetween her legs and tried to cover her breasts with her forearm, lest\nhe be offended. Fear and the cold rain beating down on her naked flesh\nmade her shiver violently. She could not hope for kindness from this\nwhite-bearded man. After all, as a priest he must condemn her as a\nharlot. And if he found out she was a Jew, he would despise her all the\nmore.\n\nThe priest reached up into the cart and took down a long walking staff\nand a gray blanket. Leaning on the staff, he approached her slowly.\nLooking at her very sadly, unconcerned about the rain soaking his robe,\nhe draped the blanket over her head and shoulders. She gripped the edges\nof the blanket and pulled it across her. As long as John's rope stayed\nslack, the blanket would cover her, although it was already cold and\nheavy with rainwater.\n\nThe kindness in the seamed, bearded face warmed Rachel, and she dropped\nto her knees before him.\n\n\"Help me, Father,\" she begged. \"Do not let him take me away from here.\"\n\n\"Get up, child.\" Leaning heavily on the staff with one hand, he used the\nother to help her to her feet, and she saw how stiffly he moved and\nheard him give a little groan of pain.\n\n\"You are hurt, Father.\"\n\n\"Just a few old broken bones,\" he said. \"It has been months, and they\nare mending well enough.\"\n\nHe reached under the blanket that covered her, and she shrank away from\nhis hand.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I mean no harm.\" Without looking at her, and\nhardly touching her, he managed to loosen the rope around her chest so\nthat it fell to the ground. She stepped out of the loop, and it slid\naway from her. She looked up and saw John coil the rope and tie it to\nhis saddle. His face was reddened and his mouth compressed with anger.\n\n\"It is useless to try to outrun a Tartar on horseback,\" said the priest.\n\"They are like centaurs. What is your name, child?\"\n\nAs she told him, Rachel felt a glimmering of hope. The priest had spoken\nto John in his own language, and the Tartar seemed to have some respect\nfor him. At least he was no longer trying to drag her away.\n\n\"I am Friar Mathieu d'Alcon,\" said the white-bearded priest. \"What does\nthis man want with you?\"\n\nRachel felt a blush burn her face.\n\n\"He has lain with me, and he paid money to me and Madama Tilia,\" Rachel\nsaid, barely able to choke out the admission of her shame. \"Now he is\nleaving Orvieto, and he wants to take me with him.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu sighed and shook his head. \"And so young. Jesus, be\nmerciful.\" He turned to John and spoke to him in a soft, reasonable\nvoice. Rachel sensed that the priest was chiding the Tartar gently.\nJohn's answer was a series of short phrases, shrill with anger. He\nfinished by slicing the air with his hand in a gesture of flat refusal.\nRachel's heart grew heavy with despair.\n\n\"He will not listen to me,\" said the friar. \"He thinks he has a right to\ntake you. His customs are not ours.\"\n\n\"But you are a priest. Does he not have to do what you tell him?\"\n\n\"Sometimes he does what I tell him to, because he _is_ a Christian, and\nI have been his companion and confessor for some years. But he is more\nTartar than Christian, and Tartars keep many women.\"\n\nRachel's limbs turned to ice. \"Does he think he owns me?\"\n\nColder than the rain pouring down on her was the terror of being torn\nfrom the few friends she had, to be used for pleasure by a man who could\nnot even speak to her. She put her hands to her face and started to sob\nheavily.\n\nA burst of loud laughter from John made her look up. At first she\nthought he was laughing at her tears, but he was pointing at Cassio's\ndangling body. Still chuckling, he said something to Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"He says that man used to be the stud bull hereabouts. Now he is dead\nbeef.\"\n\nRachel shook her head. \"He has no pity for Cassio--nor for me.\" Filled\nwith revulsion, she thought she would rather die than spend the rest of\nher life with that brute.\n\nFriar Mathieu looked off into the distance. \"That is how it is with the\nTartars.\"\n\nRachel shuddered. To John, Cassio was just a bundle of rags to be\nlaughed at, and she was a plaything to be dragged through the world.\n\n\"Please help me get away,\" she begged Friar Mathieu. \"I think I will\nkill myself if I have to stay with him.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu closed his eyes in pain. \"Do not talk that way, my child.\nEvery person's life belongs to God.\"\n\nAnother voice boomed down at them from above, speaking a language Rachel\nhad heard before but did not know. The sour-faced man with the big nose\npeered at them out of a cavernous hood. The French cardinal. He towered\nover them on a great black horse. Rachel shuddered at the sight of him.\n\n\"Pardonnez-moi, votr'Eminence,\" said Friar Mathieu calmly. He went on,\nin what must have been French, to say something which she supposed from\nhis gestures was about John and her.\n\nThe cardinal's reply seemed as loud as thunder. He pointed at Rachel,\nand she cringed away. What was he saying, that she belonged to John?\n\nFeeling hopeless, Rachel stood weeping silently while the priest and the\ncardinal argued what was to become of her in a language she did not\nunderstand.\n\n_Has God abandoned me because I have sinned?_\n\nShe looked at Tilia's house, at the horrid sight of the hanged man above\nthe door, cries of women barely audible over the rumble of thunder and\nthe pounding of rain on the pavement. She saw men carrying boxes and\nbundles of cloth out the front door and realized that they were\nransacking the place.\n\nCold horror swept her as she realized she was going to lose everything.\nEverything she had earned by her shame was in a chest in Tilia's room.\n\nFriar Mathieu cried out something in French. In the midst of her misery,\nRachel was shocked to see a beggar-priest publicly chastising a\ncardinal.\n\nThe cardinal stared at the friar, seemingly also shocked. He blinked as\nlightning flashed overhead.\n\nRachel said, \"Good Father--\"\n\nThe cardinal found his voice and roared back at the friar, jabbing a\nbejeweled finger at Rachel and turning on her a glare of utter contempt.\nHis look hurt Rachel as much as if he had hit her in the face with dung.\nShe pulled the soaking blanket tighter around herself. She saw that,\nstaunch as the friar might be, all the power was on the other side.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"if nothing can stop them from taking me, at least\nlet me get the things I own from the house. My clothes and books.\" She\ndid not mention the bags of gold ducats in Tilia's chest, though John\nmight know of them. \"Let me take them with me and travel with you.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu nodded and spoke again angrily to the cardinal.\n\nThe cardinal yanked on the reins of his horse, turning the black head\naround, up the street. He flung his answer over his shoulder.\n\nFriar Mathieu turned a sad face toward Rachel. \"He says you and I and\nJohn can go back into the house and get what belongs to you. And you can\ntravel in my cart. But I am not to interfere if the Tartar desires you.\"\nHe shook his head. \"I promise you, child, as long as you are with me,\nJohn will not touch you. I was a knight before I was a priest. They can\nmake me stand by and witness murder and robbery. But not rape.\"\n\nRachel looked up to see John grinning at her with proprietary pride.\nLike Rachel, he had not understood a word of the argument between the\nfriar and the cardinal, but he understood well enough that Rachel was\nstill his prisoner.\n\nShe felt a little better for having an ally in Friar Mathieu. But she\npromised herself that whatever John might think, he would never take her\nback to his country. She really would kill herself first.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe storm had passed over Orvieto by the time the cart carrying Rachel\nwas bumping along the road to Perugia. As she sat on a bench beside the\nold priest, looking out through the open front end of the cart, Rachel\nsaw patches of blue sky above the hills to the northeast.\n\nJohn had gone with Friar Mathieu and helped him find her chest in\nTilia's room and the key to the padlock, hidden under Tilia's mattress.\nHe had ordered two of his Armenian guards to carry the chest out for\nRachel and load it in the back of the cart, along with another chest of\nher books and clothing. He himself had smilingly handed her the key. As\nif he expected her to be grateful, she thought.\n\nSo she was still a wealthy woman, Rachel thought bitterly, even though\nshe was also a prisoner.\n\nWith Friar Mathieu sitting on the bench up front beside the driver, she\nhad gone to the back of the cart and opened both chests to make sure\neverything was there, even hefting the bags of gold. Then she had dried\nherself off and put on a bright blue linen tunic.\n\nOn the outside she was more comfortable now; within, desolate. Even\nthough Tilia had sold her to the Tartar, Tilia's house had been home to\nher for nearly a year. She had come to know the men whom today she had\nseen murdered, and the women who had been forcibly taken by the Tartars'\nbodyguards. They and Sophia, David, and Lorenzo were the only friends\nshe had known since Angelo was killed. Now she would never see them\nagain.\n\nShe had not felt so wretched since the night of Angelo's death.\n\nTo comfort herself, she took out the Hebrew prayer book Angelo had given\nher. To have light to read by, she would have to go to the front of the\ncart and sit beside Friar Mathieu. The sight of her prayer book might\nturn the old priest against her. She remembered Angelo telling her how\npriests at Paris had burned a thousand or more volumes of the Talmud.\nTears had come to his eyes at the thought of so many holy books,\nlovingly copied by hand, destroyed.\n\nBut Friar Mathieu had been kind to her even when she admitted that she\nhad lain with the Tartar for money. He did not seem like the kind of man\nwho would despise her for being a Jew.\n\nRight now she desperately needed to be able to trust someone, and she\ndecided that she could trust Friar Mathieu.\n\nBalancing herself against the swaying of the cart, she climbed on the\nbench beside the old priest.\n\nHer book was a collection of writings and prayers, including passages\nfrom the Torah. Some rabbi, or perhaps more than one, with quill pens\nand parchments, had taken years and years to copy it out. She had marked\nthe Psalms with a ribbon and turned to them now.\n\n_For lowly people You save, but haughty eyes You bring low ..._\n\nFor the first time since she had seen those hooded riders approaching\nTilia's house, she felt some measure of peace.\n\nAfter a moment she realized Friar Mathieu was reading over her shoulder.\nFear chilled her.\n\n\"One rarely finds a _man_ learned enough to read Hebrew,\" said Friar\nMathieu gently. \"In a woman as young as yourself it is positively\nmiraculous.\"\n\nShe smiled timidly in answer to the kindliness in his eyes. \"My husband\nwas a seller of books. He taught me to read the language of our\nancestors.\"\n\n\"Your husband?\" His eyes, their blue irises pale with age, opened wider.\n\"You have been married?\" He shook his head. \"People never cease to\nsurprise me. I would like to know you better, child. Will you tell me\nabout your life?\"\n\nHis gentle tone gave her heart. Not since Sophia had talked to her on\nthe road from Rome to Orvieto had anybody been interested in who she\nwas. Talking to this good priest about her past, she could forget for a\nwhile the terror of present and future. She would tell him everything.\n\n\n\n\nLIV\n\n\nDaoud suddenly realized that droplets of moisture had appeared on the\ngrayish-yellow wall near his face. How long the water had been forming\nhe did not, could not, know. Long enough for some of the droplets to\ncoalesce and run down the wall, where they joined a line of dampness\nwhere the floor met the wall.\n\nHe wondered where the water was coming from. It might be raining\noutside, above this dungeon. It would take, he thought, a very great\nrainstorm for the water to seep through down here.\n\nHe lay on his stomach on the rack table, his stretched arms and legs\nfeeling like blocks of wood. He had no idea how much time had passed\nsince d'Ucello left him with the threat that when he returned he would\nburn Daoud's manhood away with Greek Fire. Most of that time he had been\nawake, but had been dreaming of the paradise of the Hashishiyya.\n\nErculio had slept on a pile of rags in a corner of the dungeon, leaving\nit to the guards to make sure that d'Ucello's order was carried out and\nDaoud remained awake. The guards were, as Erculio must have known they\nwould be, halfhearted about carrying out their mandate. They poked and\nstruck him with sticks at intervals, but they did not try to injure him.\nDaoud was even able to sleep for brief periods between their proddings.\nThey let most of the candles in the dungeon go out, leaving the great\nstone chamber in semidarkness.\n\nErculio managed to talk to him when the two guards were dozing. He held\nup what looked like a large pearl.\n\n\"There is a swift-acting poison sealed inside this glass ball. When he\ncomes to burn your prickle off, I will slip it into your mouth. When you\nfeel the fire, break the ball with your teeth and swallow. It will look\nas though the pain killed you. If you can manage it, swallow the glass,\ntoo, so they do not find it in your mouth after you're dead.\"\n\nSo calm did Daoud's Sufi training keep him that he was able to wonder\nwhere Erculio had got such a thing, and how the poison was sealed inside\nthe ball, and what kind of poison it was. He could even think calmly\nabout what it would feel like when the poison was killing him.\n\nErculio was taking a huge chance, he realized. D'Ucello might well\ndiscover that poison had killed Daoud; the podesta was a very clever and\nknowledgeable man. And if he did discover the poison, he would, of\ncourse, reason that Erculio had done it. In the midst of his calm, Daoud\nfelt admiration for the little bent man's courage.\n\nInevitably with the passing of so many hours, the pain of the cuts and\nbruises and burns he had already suffered, and the ache of lying in the\nsame position with his limbs stretched beyond endurance, would at times\nbreak through the mental wall he had built up against it. Remembering\nthe words of Sheikh Saadi--_If pain comes despite your training, invite\nit into your soul's tent as you would a welcome guest_--he allowed the\npain to wash over him. And when the first acute shock of it had passed,\nhe was able to restore the wall.\n\nFrom time to time he would think of what was soon going to happen to\nhim. And it would be like a spear of ice driven into his heart. Again,\nhe let himself feel the terror, the anguish, the agonized wondering,\n_When will he come?_ and then, when his mind was numbed by the horror of\nit, cast it out again.\n\nIf he had not had the training of those two great and very different\nmasters, Sheikh Saadi and Fayum al-Burz, he would have been mad with\nterror by now. Each time the door to the dungeon opened, the spear of\nice pierced him again. Would it be now that he would lose his manhood in\npain beyond imagining, pain so great that he would gladly die at once?\n\nWhen no one was nearby, Erculio came close, cursed at him loudly,\npunched him, and whispered, \"He is gone much longer than he said he\nwould be. It is late afternoon. I told you he does not want to do this.\"\n\n_But he will do it_, Daoud thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSometime later--Daoud could not tell how long--the door swung open and\nd'Ucello strode in. Daoud let the cold fear flood into him. He even let\nhimself whimper a bit. The tide of maddening terror reached its height\nand then receded, and he was in command of himself again.\n\nThe two guards snapped to attention, and Erculio scurried over to him.\nThe podesta's face was set, and when he came close to Daoud, there was\npain in his eyes.\n\n\"Has he spoken?\" he said to Erculio.\n\n\"Not a word, Signore, and I have made him suffer greatly.\"\n\n_I shall be leaving this world just moments from now. I will fix my\nthoughts on God._\n\n\"I gave you more time than I intended to,\" d'Ucello said to Daoud.\n\"There was a small battaglia at a bordello on the east side of town. A\nplace you are familiar with. The house run by that fat old whore, Tilia\nCaballo. Where, according to her testimony, you were when the French\ncavaliere was murdered outside Cardinal Ugolini's. Your putana friend\nhas been despoiled, I fear, and many of her menservants killed and her\nwomen hurt.\"\n\n_Rachel._\n\nHe desperately wanted to know whether Rachel had been hurt, and he dared\nnot speak of her to d'Ucello. Anguish for Rachel cracked his armor\nagainst fear. He saw what was going to happen to him, felt the liquid\nfire, saw his death. Cold sweat broke out on his body.\n\nHe tried to turn his mind back to Tilia's house.\n\n_And Tilia, what of Tilia?_\n\nIt surprised him that his anxiety for Tilia was so strong. She had come\nto be his friend without his ever realizing it.\n\nHe thought of Francesca, who had comforted him so during his first\nmonths in Orvieto. Of the women who had helped him initiate Sordello.\nAll of them no doubt raped, and perhaps hurt in other ways besides.\n\n_The savages! This would never have happened in El Kahira._\n\nIt was safe enough to ask, \"Who did it?\"\n\n\"The ambassadors from Tartary and their guards, as they were leaving\nOrvieto to follow the pope to Perugia. The French Cardinal de Verceuil\nwas there and, far from trying to prevent the wickedness, urged them on.\nIt seems you dislike the Tartars with good reason.\"\n\nThe podesta paused. He still hoped, Daoud realized, to provoke or invite\nhim into letting something slip.\n\nIf it was the Tartars, they must have come for Rachel.\n\nD'Ucello picked up the flask of Greek Fire from the table, where it had\nstood these many hours, where Daoud could plainly see it. He had, most\nof the time, avoided looking at it.\n\n\"Were any of the women taken away?\" Daoud asked. That, too, should be a\nsafe question. Every moment he and d'Ucello talked, d'Ucello hoping he\nmight yet learn something, was another moment of wholeness and life.\n\n_But I must not deceive myself. These are only moments. I affirm that\nGod is One. God be merciful. God receive me. I die as Your warrior._\n\n\"Yes,\" said d'Ucello, eyeing him thoughtfully. \"Did you have reason to\nthink someone would be carried off?\"\n\nIt hurt Daoud's neck to turn and try to look into d'Ucello's face. Daoud\nlet his head fall to the table on which he lay.\n\n\"I visited there often. I made friends with some of the women.\"\n\nD'Ucello snorted. \"From now on you will have no need to go to\nbordellos.\"\n\nTo gain another moment, Daoud said, \"I marvel that you possess Greek\nFire. The making of it is a great secret, and it is too dangerous to\ntransport far. If a bit of it gets loose on a ship, that ship is seen no\nmore.\"\n\nD'Ucello squinted at him. \"If you were truly only a trader from\nTrebizond, you would be too terrified to wonder where I got this stuff.\"\n\n\"Allow me at the last a bit of dignity,\" Daoud pleaded, looking up at\nd'Ucello. He saw guilt in d'Ucello's shifting eyes.\n\n\"A member of the Knights Templar back from the Holy Land let me copy the\nformula,\" said d'Ucello. \"Out of curiosity, I had an alchemist make it\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Curiosity is a worthier motive than torture,\" said Daoud, hoping he was\nundermining d'Ucello's resolution and making the podesta feel ashamed.\n\nBut the dark eyes flashed angrily. \"That is enough. Turn him on his\nback, Erculio. You should have done that already.\"\n\n_I pushed him too far_, Daoud thought despairingly.\n\n\"Yes, Signore.\" Erculio beckoned the guards. \"Here, you two. Help me.\"\n\nWhen his arms and legs were untied, Daoud groaned at the sudden release\nof the tension in stiffened muscles. A savage pain tore through the\nnumbness in his limbs.\n\n\"Be still, whoreson!\" Erculio snarled, clamping a hand over Daoud's\nmouth. Daoud felt the glass ball pressed against his lips, and opened\nhis mouth to receive it.\n\nThe ball was not large, about half the size of a pigeon's egg, but it\nfelt huge in his mouth. Thinking about the swift death it held within\nit, Daoud wondered if it would be easy or hard to break the glass.\n\nThey were tying his hands again, and he had the ball under his tongue.\nIf he tried to speak now, d'Ucello would know he had something in his\nmouth. No more delaying by talking to the podesta.\n\n\"Strip off his loincloth,\" said d'Ucello, and Erculio tore it away.\nHolding the flask in one hand, d'Ucello leaned forward, peering at\nDaoud's groin. Daoud could feel his penis and scrotum shrinking.\n\n_What fools we men are to be so proud of our members, and think them\nsuch sources of power. How truly vulnerable is that little bit of\nflesh._\n\nOne moment he was able to think, the next he was adrift on a sea of\nterror. His naked body shook violently as d'Ucello scrutinized him. He\nstruggled to keep his Sufi training in mind. Only that could help him\nnow to die bravely.\n\n\"He is circumcised,\" said d'Ucello, his black eyebrows twisting in a\nfrown.\n\n_Oh, God! Cloud his mind._\n\n\"What do we know of that place he comes from?\" said Erculio. \"Trebizond?\nMaybe all the men in Trebizond are circumcised.\"\n\n\"Only Jews are circumcised,\" said d'Ucello. \"And Saracens.\" He brought\nhis face closer to Daoud's. \"Speak, man. Why is your foreskin cut off?\"\n\n\"How could he be a Saracen or a Jew?\" said Erculio. \"He looks like a\nFrank.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said d'Ucello impatiently. \"I want to hear his answer.\"\n\nDaoud lay motionless, praying that God would let d'Ucello kill him and\nbe done with it.\n\n\"Are you part of some Jewish plot?\" d'Ucello demanded.\n\nDaoud almost smiled at that, but he only looked up at the blackened\nceiling beam and said nothing.\n\n\"Answer me!\" d'Ucello growled. He shook the flask at Daoud.\n\nDaoud closed his eyes. Now the fire would come.\n\nHe heard a hammering at the wooden door on the other side of the\ndungeon. One of the guards went to open it at d'Ucello's command.\n\nAnother delay! Now he was almost frantic for it to end. He was tempted\nto bite down on the little glass ball. Why must he wait and wait for\nthat terrible flame to burn away his life?\n\n\"Signore!\" Daoud turned his head and saw the clerk called Vincenzo in\nthe doorway of the dungeon. Beside him was a man in orange and green,\nthe colors of the Monaldeschi family. Daoud remembered the thick black\nbrows and the stern face, the grizzled hair. He had seen this man the\nnight of the contessa's reception for the Tartars.\n\n\"The Contessa di Monaldeschi's steward brings a message from her,\"\nVincenzo said.\n\nWith a sigh d'Ucello set the flask of Greek Fire on the table beside\nDaoud. In the sigh Daoud heard, not impatience, but relief. D'Ucello was\nglad to put off doing this unspeakable thing, but it meant only that\nDaoud would have to endure a longer wait.\n\n_Because he does not want to torture me, I suffer the more._\n\nD'Ucello was still hoping the waiting would break him. And it might. In\nspite of all his training, in spite of the Soma that kept him calm and\nheld the pain away, Daoud felt himself at the very edge of his\nendurance. He just might break.\n\nThe podesta, the clerk, and the contessa's steward muttered together by\nthe door of the dungeon. Turning his head, Daoud could watch them.\n\nD'Ucello was jabbing his hands furiously toward the steward. He was\nhaving trouble keeping his voice down.\n\n\"This is intolerable!\" he cried.\n\nThe steward took a step backward, but he kept his face set. He spoke in\na voice too low for Daoud to hear.\n\n\"Fires of hell!\" D'Ucello shook both clenched fists over his head.\n\nHe turned and pointed at Daoud. \"Keep that one there on the rack till I\nreturn, Erculio.\"\n\n\"Where is my Signore going?\"\n\nD'Ucello opened his mouth. His face grew redder in the torchlight, and\nhe closed it again.\n\n\"I will not be gone very long,\" he said. \"I have to _persuade_ someone\nof something.\"\n\n\"Shall I torment this fellow while you are gone?\"\n\n\"Do as you please. At least see that he gets no rest.\"\n\nHe strode across the room to glare down at Daoud. \"You will keep your\nmanhood for another hour or so. By God's grace you have more time to\nthink. About what will happen to you and how you can save yourself. Do\nnot think you have escaped. I will be back.\"\n\nHe lifted his hand. A bolt of panic shot through Daoud as he thought\nthat if d'Ucello hit him hard enough he might break the ball of poison\nin his mouth. He held himself rigid.\n\nD'Ucello lowered his hand.\n\n\"Damn you!\" he snarled, and turned away.\n\nNow Daoud wished d'Ucello _had_ broken the glass ball. He would have to\nlie for hours longer now, waiting for pain and death. The thought of\nthose hours was in itself more agonizing than all the tortures he had so\nfar suffered. But God had chosen to let him live a little longer, and he\nmust accept these moments of life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"According to Vincenzo,\" Erculio whispered, \"the contessa ordered the\npodesta to stop torturing you. Your allies must have gotten to her.\"\n\nThe guards and the clerk had left, but Daoud heard their excited voices\nbeyond the partly open door. Erculio now had a chance to take out the\npoison ball. The inside of Daoud's mouth ached from holding the delicate\norb, and he sighed with relief.\n\n\"There is more,\" Erculio said. \"An army of Sienese Ghibellini passed\nthrough Montefiascone this morning. We have known that the Sienese were\nmarching against Orvieto, but we were not aware they were almost upon\nus. The contessa and the podesta must discuss the defense as well as\nyour fate.\"\n\nLorenzo was with that army, Daoud thought. Lorenzo might be able to\nrescue him if he got here in time.\n\n\"I fear it will be no better for you than before,\" Erculio went on.\n\"D'Ucello knows how to make the contessa see things his way. He will\nprobably persuade her that you must be tortured. And since he suspects\nyou of being a Ghibellino agent, he will want you dead before the\nGhibellini army comes.\"\n\n\"As God wills,\" Daoud croaked. A numbness had come over him as if he\nwere already dead. This was older and simpler and more effective than\nthe techniques of Sufi and Hashishiyya. This deadness was his body's\nfinal answer to a night and a day of unbearable pain and fear.\n\n\n\n\nLV\n\n\nThe woman's shoulders shook, and she rocked back and forth. She could\nnot speak. Tilia sat on Sophia's bed holding the sobbing woman in her\narms.\n\nTilia, calling her Francesca, tried to calm her. Sophia at first had\nthought Francesca was a madwoman. Her tunic was torn and rain-wet, her\nlong black hair not bound up and covered but in wild disarray.\n\n\"You are safe now, piccione,\" Tilia kept saying. \"Calm down and tell us\nwhat happened.\" Tilia herself was pale, her wide mouth drawn tight.\n\nSeeing even Tilia's face grim, Sophia felt a chill of apprehension and\nan even greater anxiety to know what this was all about.\n\n\"I know I should not come here, Madama. Forgive me. But I did not know\nwhat else to do. I walked so far to get here, and I kept getting lost,\nand I was afraid to ask anyone where Cardinal Ugolini's mansion was.\"\n\n\"How did you know I was here, Francesca?\" Tilia asked.\n\n\"Cassio told me just before--before--\" Francesca was convulsed with\nsobs.\n\nTilia turned to Sophia. \"I have never seen her like this.\"\n\n\"Your house is destroyed,\" said Francesca, choking and gasping and\nwiping her nose on her sleeve.\n\n\"Destroyed!\" Tilia and Sophia stared at each other. A shock of fear\nswept through Sophia. Already terrified for Daoud, she was now swept by\ndread for Rachel and pity for Tilia.\n\n_Any more of this, and I will lose my wits._\n\n\"And they hanged Cassio.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" Tilia screamed.\n\nAnother jolt of terror. Sophia thought of that day in Constantinople\nwhen the Franks had run riot, burning whole districts and murdering\ntownspeople. Was this another such day?\n\n\"And they--and they killed Hector and Claudio and Apollonio and the\nother menservants.\"\n\n\"Who did this?\" Tilia was on her feet, standing over Francesca,\nshouting. \"Who? Who?\"\n\nWas the whole world turning against them, Sophia wondered. Was it the\npodesta's men? The Monaldeschi?\n\nFrancesca put her hands over her face and wept softly for a moment, then\ncontinued. \"The Tartars and that French cardinal who always came with\nthem. They came with armed men, dozens of them. They were after Rachel.\"\n\n_Rachel!_\n\nThe horror of it all was like a spear driven through Sophia's breast.\nShe sat down on her bed as the room went black around her.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she heard herself saying. \"Oh, not Rachel!\" Fear stopped her\nheart. She slumped on the bed, her hand pressed to her chest.\n\n\"When Cassio tried to stop them, they went mad,\" said Francesca. \"The\nmen-at-arms killed every man in the house, and they raped all the women.\nSome of us over and over again. And they tore the house apart and stole\neverything they could carry. What they could not take, they smashed. And\nall the while they kept laughing, Madama. They kept laughing.\"\n\nSophia felt bile burning in her throat. If she had to hear any more\nhorrors, she was going to vomit.\n\nTilia sat looking stunned, shaking her head from side to side.\n\n\"What happened to Rachel?\" Sophia managed to choke out.\n\n\"She tried to run away. She got out of the house. The white-haired\nTartar, the one who beds with her, chased her. He must have caught her,\nbecause I heard the cardinal shouting that they had found the one they\ncame for and they must get on the road or they would be fighting the\nSienese.\"\n\n_Rachel wanted to come here with me this morning_, Sophia thought. _If\nonly I had brought her here, we could have saved her._ She sobbed aloud.\nHer stomach hurt.\n\n\"May God rot all of them with leprosy,\" said Tilia. She hugged Francesca\nhard, and then stood up.\n\n\"I must go to my house.\"\n\nGoing back to Tilia's would not help Rachel, Sophia thought. They had\nprobably lost her forever. Despair dragged her down. _Rachel, Rachel!_\nWhat were they doing to her?\n\n\"First David is arrested. Now this,\" she said, tears running steadily\ndown her cheeks.\n\n_I had trusted Daoud to foresee danger and guide us through it_, Sophia\nthought. _And now Daoud--_\n\nShe still did not know whether Daoud was safe, or even still alive.\nWould the contessa be able to stop whatever was being done to Daoud?\nThat had been quite enough to be terrified about.\n\nFrancesca's tear-reddened eyes widened. \"David has been arrested?\"\nSomething in her tone told Sophia there had been something between\nFrancesca and David.\n\n_Of course_, she told herself. _Did you think the man slept alone until\nyou gave yourself to him?_\n\nShe and Francesca shared some of the same grief. Sophia wanted to\nconsole her.\n\n\"Cardinal Ugolini has persuaded the Contessa di Monaldeschi to intercede\nfor David,\" Sophia told her, \"and the cardinal has gone to the Palazzo\ndel Podesta, hoping to bring David back here again.\"\n\n\"It may be hours before David is released,\" said Tilia, raising a\ncautioning hand. \"_If_ the podesta does agree. Or he may persuade the\ncontessa that he was right to arrest David.\"\n\nThese were the very thoughts that had been tormenting Sophia. She needed\nto do something.\n\n\"If you want to go to your house, Tilia, I will go with you.\" It\noccurred to her immediately after she spoke that the streets might be\ndangerous for both of them. But she could not stand the agony of sitting\nhere, waiting for the possibility of still worse news.\n\n\"Sophia, you and the cardinal must not be linked to Tilia Caballo's\nbordello,\" said Tilia.\n\n\"I will keep myself hidden,\" said Sophia.\n\nSophia made Francesca comfortable in her own bed, then went down with\nTilia to the great hall of Ugolini's mansion and sent for Riccardo.\n\nHand in hand, Sophia holding a lighted candle, the two women made their\nway through the tunnel that led to the potterymaker's shop.\n\nRiccardo met them with another hired cart, like the one that had taken\nthem from Tilia's to the cardinal's this morning. This was a covered\ncart full of big urns of olive oil. The air, much cooler than before the\nstorm, felt refreshing on Sophia's face. Getting into the cart, Sophia\nlooked up and saw big black clouds rolling across the sky, their rounded\nedges outlined by the red light of the setting sun.\n\nThe cart, pulled by an old draft horse, bumped over cobblestones and\nsplashed through puddles. Tilia and Sophia sat on a bench behind\nRiccardo, under the cart's canvas cover, so they could not be seen from\nthe street. All around them Sophia heard church bells ringing for the\nAngelus. She could close her eyes for a moment and imagine she was\nhearing the bells of the three hundred churches of Constantinople. She\nlonged to be in the Polis again, among civilized people.\n\n_That is why I am here, is it not? To keep the barbarians here, and away\nfrom there._\n\nShe saw torchlight ahead. This was Tilia's street, farther up a hill\nthat slowed down the elderly horse.\n\nFrom this distance the house looked undamaged, but what was that hanging\nabove the door?\n\n\"Merciful God!\" Sophia whispered.\n\nShe saw the body of a man suspended from a rope tied to the balcony\nabove the doorway.\n\n\"Oh, God,\" said Tilia. \"Oh, poor, poor Cassio.\" She dabbed at her eyes\nwith the sleeve of her gown.\n\nNow, by the torchlight, Sophia could see several men, dressed in the\nyellow and blue of the commune, gathered in front of the house. The\npodesta's watchmen.\n\nThe street was full of common folk, who had to back up to give the cart\nroom to move forward. As it approached the front door, one of the\npodesta's men raised a hand to stop it.\n\n\"I will be right back,\" Tilia said, squeezing Sophia's arm. She\nclambered out of the cart with Riccardo's help. Riccardo tied the cart\nto a hitching post on the side of the street.\n\nTying her scarf across her face, Sophia watched from inside the cart.\nThe man who had stopped the horse barred Tilia again as she started\ntoward her house. He was a slender, middle-aged man with a prominent\narch to his nose and heavy-lidded eyes. Riccardo moved toward him, but\nTilia put her hand on the servant's arm. Tilia would not want the\ncardinal's man brawling with an officer of the watch.\n\n\"I am Tilia Caballo, and this is my house,\" she said in a commanding\nvoice. \"How long have you been here?\"\n\nWhat a brave woman Tilia was, Sophia thought. Could she herself face an\nofficer of the watch and speak to him sternly like that?\n\n\"Since the hour of None, Madama. The podesta was here, but he had to\nleave.\"\n\n\"And what are you doing? Just standing about? Have you left that poor\nman's body to hang there since mid-afternoon, where women and children\ncould see it? Take him down at once. Are you not Christians? How can you\ntreat the dead with such disrespect?\"\n\nIn the midst of her own horror, Sophia took comfort from Tilia's display\nof strength, and wondered how the stout little woman felt inside.\n\nSophia had hated her at times, and still thought Tilia had done a\nhorrible wrong to Rachel. But what she felt for her now was mostly\nadmiration.\n\nAfter all, all of them were equally guilty of what had happened to\nRachel. The blame should not fall on Tilia alone.\n\nThe beak-nosed officer called orders to others nearby. But his\nexpression as he turned back to Tilia was surly.\n\n\"There might be some question about whether _he_ was a Christian,\nMadama. This is, after all, a house of ill repute.\"\n\n\"Ill _repute_!\" Tilia blustered. \"This is--this was--the handsomest\nhouse of pleasure in Orvieto. And our patrons occupied the very highest\nlevels in the Church. You would be wise to have a care how you speak of\nmy house.\"\n\nSophia felt herself smiling. Amazing, when there was so much to weep\nover.\n\n\"Would I?\" The officer thrust his nose at Tilia. \"Perhaps you can tell\nme why such a splendid bordello with such fine customers needed a\ntorture chamber in the cellar? Or why you had to keep piccioni on the\nroof?\"\n\nSophia's body went cold. If they found out those were carrier pigeons\nand where they went, the trouble here might be deep indeed.\n\n\"So that is what you have been doing!\" Tilia stormed. \"Looting my home!\nAnd how much did you steal after the Tartars left? And no doubt\nharassing my ladies, as if they had not been through enough already. And\nleaving my Cassio to swing from a rope. My God, there has been murder,\nkidnapping, rape, and theft done here, and you prattle of piccioni. What\nhave you done about catching the _bestioni_ who did this?\"\n\nNow the officer did look intimidated. \"Madama, we are not certain who\ndid these things--\"\n\n\"Not certain!\" Tilia shook her fist at him. \"Everyone in Orvieto knows\nwho did this. It was the French cardinal, Paulus de Verceuil, and the\nTartar ambassadors to the pope. Why are you here, standing about like\nfools, when you could be pursuing them and bringing them to justice?\"\n\nThe French, thought Sophia. If Simon had been here, would he have\nallowed this to happen? She felt a twinge of guilt, remembering that she\nhad betrayed Daoud by not telling him where Simon was going.\n\n\"What you tell us is but hearsay, Madama.\"\n\n\"Hearsay! Every lady in that house is a witness.\"\n\n\"In any case, those you accuse are beyond our reach.\"\n\n\"Because you _let_ them get beyond your reach,\" Tilia retorted. \"Oh, you\nfeckless man! Let me by.\"\n\nAnd then Sophia was alone in the cart and frightened, because she knew\nshe was surrounded by the podesta's men and by townspeople who might\nwell be hostile. For reassurance she smoothed the scarf over her nose\nand mouth and patted the small dagger that hung at her belt, concealed\nunder her outer tunic.\n\nShe heard a creaking noise above her and looked out to see the podesta's\nmen hauling Cassio's body up to the balcony. Tilia, she thought, was\ntaking charge. Left to themselves, the watchmen would probably have just\ncut the rope and let the poor man's corpse fall to the ground.\n\nSophia thought of Rachel, helpless, carried off by the Tartar, and\nDaoud, equally helpless, in the Palazzo del Podesta. She had no idea\nwhat was happening to either of them, and horrors filled her mind. Her\nhands twisted together, her fingers crushing one another, and she\nstarted to cry again.\n\nTilia was crying, too, when she came back and Riccardo helped her climb\ninto the carriage. She could not speak for a time, and Sophia sat with\nher arm around Tilia's quaking shoulders. It was for this, thought\nSophia, she had come. The only way she could help Tilia was to be with\nher and to comfort her. And in doing so she comforted herself.\n\nAfter a while Tilia gave a great sigh. \"I held Cassio in my arms for a\ntime. I washed his poor face, which I could barely recognize. What hurts\nmost is that all those people, those men and those women, were loyal to\nme, and I was not there when they suffered this awful thing.\" She wiped\nher eyes with the sleeve of her green silk dress and looked sadly at\nSophia.\n\nFeeling Tilia's pain for her people, Sophia liked her all the more.\n\n\"The Tartars' men probably would have killed you if you had been there.\"\n\n\"To be sure. I would have provoked them to it as Cassio did. I would not\nhave let them take Rachel without a fight.\" She gripped the cross\nresting on her bosom, and Sophia remembered Daoud saying it held a\npoisoned blade. \"Well, my poor men will have good burials. I have been\nvery generous to the little church of San Severo in the valley south of\nhere, and now the pastor can repay my kindness by burying the seven who\ndied here. They may not have been good Christians, or Christians at all,\nbut at least in a churchyard they will lie in peace. The women who are\nhurt badly will go to the Hospital of Santa Clara. And I must hire\nguards to protect the house. My ladies do not want to stay there. I do\nnot blame them, but there is no other roof to shelter them just now,\nand with guards they will be safe enough. Anyway, those murderers are\ngone. I will come back and stay with them when I have done everything\nthere is to do.\"\n\nSophia smiled at Tilia in admiration. She was hurt, but fought the pain\nby getting on with what needed to be done.\n\n_If only there were more I could do. For Rachel. For Daoud._\n\nTilia kept shaking her head. \"They took everything of value. Thank\nFortune, most of my money is on deposit with the Lombards. But the\nchests I kept in my room are gone, and there were bags of gold coins in\nthem. One chest was Rachel's.\"\n\nSophia's heart sank further at that news. Now Rachel had not even gold\nto make up for all that had been done to her.\n\n\"The dirty ladroni,\" Tilia went on. \"That Tartar and the other one, and\nthe cardinal--all of them had such merry times in my house. How could\nthey do this to me?\"\n\n\"The Tartars are simply doing as Tartars do,\" said Sophia. \"They take\nwhat they want, and they kill anyone who tries to stop them. As for the\ncardinal, he is a Frank, and if you had seen what the Franks did to my\ncity, you would not be surprised at this.\" She felt helpless. How could\nwhat she was saying possibly comfort Tilia?\n\nTilia struck the heel of her hand against her forehead. \"How stupid I\nwas! When John the Tartar said he wanted to take Rachel to Perugia with\nhim, I should have known he would not accept my refusal. I should have\nbeen prepared for this.\"\n\nSophia, remembering how Rachel had begged to leave Tilia's house with\nher that morning, spoke sharply before she could stop herself.\n\n\"As it was, you kept Rachel safe for him until he was ready to take\nher.\"\n\nTilia gasped. \"That is very unfair.\"\n\nNow Sophia was deeply angry with herself. She had already decided that\nwhat had happened to Rachel should not be blamed on Tilia. And she was\ntrying--or should be trying--to comfort her. Her cruel Greek tongue had\ngot the better of her.\n\nSophia was about to apologize when a shout from outside stopped her.\n\n\"The mistress of the whores' house is in this cart. I saw her get into\nit.\"\n\n\"Now she sees how God punishes fornicators.\"\n\n\"We should never have let her move into our street.\"\n\n\"Let her get her house and all of her filth out of here.\"\n\nSophia shrank back into the cart, her heart quaking. She had seen mobs\ntear people to pieces.\n\nShe said, \"Tilia, that crowd frightens me, and the podesta's men may not\nbe much protection. Let us get out of here, please.\"\n\n\"I will show you what I think of that crowd,\" said Tilia. She pushed her\nway to the front of the cart and stood beside Riccardo with her hands on\nher hips. Sophia could see people gathered, white faces in the\nmoonlight, red faces in the torchlight.\n\n\"Ignoranti!\" Tilia shouted. \"Fannulloni! My house is the best on your\nstreet. The rest is one big, foul quintana. Where were you idlers when\nmy men were murdered and my women were raped by a gang of foreigners?\nHome pissing in your pants, eh? Brave Orvietans you are. Get out of my\nway.\"\n\nSophia heard a muttering from the crowd, but no one tried to answer\nTilia. Sophia shook her head.\n\n_If I live to be a hundred, I don't think I could ever face down a mob\nlike that._\n\nTilia turned to Riccardo, whose broad shoulders beside her had lent\nforce to her words. \"Drive on.\"\n\nThe cart rolled forward, and the people fell back, squeezing against the\nhousefronts to let it by. Sophia, devastated, sagged back against a\ngreat earthenware olive oil jar. She was too worn out even to cry\nanymore.\n\n\n\n\nLVI\n\n\n_Now, at last, this is the end_, thought Daoud as the door of the\nchamber of torment rasped open. He had been preparing himself for death,\npraying, commending himself to God. Now he hoped that without much more\npain, God would take him.\n\nErculio, who had been sitting with his back to the wall, pushed himself\nto his feet and scuttled forward.\n\nD'Ucello entered, followed by two guards in yellow and blue.\n\n\"Welcome back, Signore,\" Erculio cried. \"Shall we now roast this\nstubborn fellow's ballocks?\"\n\nErculio, Daoud sensed, enjoyed feigning the gleeful torturer precisely\nbecause it was a way of tormenting d'Ucello himself.\n\nD'Ucello walked over to where Daoud lay naked on the rack and glowered\nsilently down at him, his lips pressed together under his thin mustache.\nThe podesta glanced at the silver flask on the table, but made no move\nto pick it up. He seemed to be studying Daoud, searching for something\nas he looked into his eyes.\n\nHe blinked and turned away. \"Untie him.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do to him now, Signore?\" said Erculio, still all\neagerness. He needed to know, Daoud thought, when it would be time for\nthe poison ball.\n\n\"Untie him and sit him up slowly,\" said d'Ucello.\n\n\"Oh, Signore!\" Erculio exclaimed. \"May we not play with him some more?\"\n\nD'Ucello's mouth twisted. \"Enough of your infernal questions,\npervertito! Do as I say.\"\n\nThe impact of this surprise was like a rock smashing into Daoud's Face\nof Steel. What was happening? Was he not to have his manhood burned\naway? Was he not to die?\n\nThis, too, could be a trick. Realizing that the threat of Greek Fire had\nnot broken Daoud, d'Ucello might be making one last and very effective\nattempt to destroy his resolve by making it seem his fortunes had\nsuddenly reversed themselves.\n\nDaoud tried to bring the upwelling of hope under control, to resume the\nFace of Steel. But something in his bones was already sure that he was\nsaved, and spasms of trembling ran through his body. His face felt as if\nit were falling to pieces, the Mask of Clay broken like a useless pot.\n\nBustling around the table, Erculio undid the knots at his wrists and\nankles. In his surprise, Daoud relaxed his defenses against pain, and\nagony stabbed him like spears in every muscle of his body.\n\n\"We have not the means to treat your wounds here in this chamber,\" said\nd'Ucello. \"But lower your legs over the side of the table and sit there\nfor a moment. Then, if you can stand and walk, we will take you upstairs\nand my own physician, Fra Bernardino, will attend you.\"\n\n_Can it be? Am I to go free?_\n\nJoy burst up in him like a fountain in the desert. The candlelight\nseemed to flicker, and he nearly fainted. The sudden rush of emotion was\nunbearable.\n\nUnless this was indeed a ruse, which seemed less and less likely with\neach passing moment, his suffering was over. The contessa had\nprevailed! But why? Why had she intervened to save him? Daoud remembered\nhis vision of Sophia hurrying through the night to Tilia's house. Had\nSophia done something that brought the contessa into it?\n\nAs he sat on the edge of the table, Daoud brought his eyes up to fix\nthem on d'Ucello's. The dark eyes of the podesta, with the deep black\nrings under them, stared back. There was a look of defiance in\nd'Ucello's eyes, as if Daoud were the accuser and d'Ucello the one being\ninterrogated.\n\nDaoud's throat was tight and dry, and it ached when he tried to speak,\nbut he forced words out.\n\n\"What are you going to do with me? Are you setting me free?\"\n\nThe podesta nodded, his lips tight. \"It seems that way.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Be good enough to wait for an explanation until we are in private.\"\n\nDaoud tried to read d'Ucello's round, swarthy face, but he could not\ntell whether the podesta was relieved or angry.\n\nWhen Daoud did try to stand and put his weight on the burned and beaten\nsoles of his feet, he had to clench his teeth to keep himself from\nscreaming. His legs, which had borne the brunt of Erculio's attentions,\nfelt lifeless, and his knees buckled. He toppled forward, and d'Ucello\ncaught him. The podesta staggered under Daoud's weight. He snapped his\nfingers at a guard, who hurried over to help hold Daoud up.\n\nAs Daoud, gasping, leaned against him, d'Ucello unclasped his cloak and\nwrapped it around Daoud to cover his nakedness.\n\n_Such solicitude_, Daoud thought wryly. _I think I have suddenly become\nterribly valuable to him._\n\nThis could not be just the contessa's influence, he thought. He did not\nmean that much to her.\n\n_The Sienese._\n\nThat must be it. Erculio had said d'Ucello believed Daoud was a\nGhibellino agent, and therefore he would want to kill Daoud before the\nGhibellino army from Siena got here. But not, Daoud thought, if d'Ucello\nintended to surrender.\n\nErculio pressed something into his hand, a small leather pouch--the\ntawidh.\n\nDaoud painfully bent his head toward Erculio and read gladness in the\nbeady eyes.\n\n\"May you find work that suits you better, Messer Erculio,\" said Daoud.\n_God give you joy_, he thought.\n\n\"What he does suits him all too well, the little monster,\" said\nd'Ucello.\n\nThe podesta's men brought a litter, and two big guards, complaining\nabout Daoud's size, slowly climbed the basement steps, stopped to rest\nfor a time at the top and then carried Daoud up the marble staircase\nleading from the ground floor to the first floor of the Palazzo del\nPodesta. They were staggering by the time they lifted Daoud onto a bed\nin a small room. D'Ucello ordered the guards to send Fra Bernardino to\nhim.\n\nTwo walls of the room were lined with books and boxes of scrolls. So\nmany books must be worth a fortune, Daoud thought. The other walls were\npainted a pleasant lemon color, the ceiling a deep blue. A concave\nmirror, set at an angle in the wall beside the glazed mullioned window,\ncould direct daylight toward the writing table. The translucent window\nglass appeared nearly black; it must be night outside. The floor was of\nhardwood planks, very clean and highly polished. Moving very slowly and\npainfully, Daoud stretched himself out on the yellow satin bedcarpet and\ndrew d'Ucello's cloak over him like a blanket.\n\nThis was a great deal more comfortable than the table on which he had\nlain for what seemed like endless days and nights. He could hardly\nbelieve the vast change that had taken place.\n\n_Maybe I have gone mad and this is all like a hashish dream._\n\nD'Ucello sat at a plain oak table piled with parchments, rolled and\nunrolled. The candelabra on the table supplied the light for the room. A\nslender blue vase with graceful twin handles stood on one corner of the\ntable.\n\nThough this was not a room that would find favor in the world of Islam,\nDaoud recognized that d'Ucello, in his own Venetian way, had a highly\nrefined sense of beauty.\n\nThe podesta unlocked a tall box of dark wood, inlaid with ivory, that\nstood on his desk. Lifting the lid, he held the flask of Greek Fire over\nit.\n\n\"We are both lucky I did not use this,\" he said. He took a folded white\ncloth from the box and wrapped the flask. Then, carefully, he set the\nflask upright in the box, closed the lid, and locked it.\n\nDaoud let out a slow sigh of relief as he saw d'Ucello push the box to\none side. It was becoming easier and easier to believe that he was\nsaved.\n\nIn spite of the pain that stabbed at a thousand places on his body,\nDaoud was able to smile. \"I know why it is lucky for me. Why for you?\"\n\n\"Cardinal Ugolini and his niece went to the Contessa di Monaldeschi and\ninsisted that you were innocent, that you were the cardinal's guest.\nThey begged her to command me to release you at once. The contessa is\nvery simple in her way, and she likes to do favors for churchmen. So she\nsent a message to me that I must stop your torture and come to her at\nonce.\"\n\nDaoud could not think. He felt so light-headed that it might have been\neasy now for d'Ucello to extract admissions from him. He had been in\npain and had not eaten or slept in over a day. He must pay careful\nattention to what he was saying. It would never do to be careless with\nd'Ucello.\n\nD'Ucello smiled at Daoud, a humorless grimace that stretched his thin\nmustache.\n\n\"I am not going to ask your forgiveness,\" d'Ucello said. \"I was doing\nwhat I thought right.\"\n\nDaoud said nothing. He felt d'Ucello was being frank with him, but he\ncould not find it in his heart to forgive a man who had caused him so\nmuch pain and nearly killed him. Still, searching his heart, as Sheikh\nSaadi would have recommended, he found that he felt no hatred for\nd'Ucello. Just the wariness he would have felt toward a very large\ncrocodile.\n\n\"I have stopped torturing you not because the contessa told me to,\"\nd'Ucello went on. \"I probably could have changed her mind. But then she\nand I spoke of something else. A Ghibellino army from Siena is about to\nassault Orvieto. The contessa insisted that the militia, which I\ncommand, defend Orvieto to the last drop of our blood.\" He smiled, again\nwithout mirth.\n\n_As I suspected_, Daoud thought triumphantly. _He wants me to intercede\nfor him with the Ghibellini of Siena._\n\nAnd another happy thought came to him: _At last Lorenzo returns._\n\n\"How many men have the Sienese?\" Daoud asked.\n\n\"According to reports I have from the peasants who live north of here,\nthey number over four thousand men. I am amazed that even so prosperous\na city as Siena could hire such a large army.\"\n\n_You would be even more amazed to know where they got the money_,\nthought Daoud.\n\nD'Ucello went on. \"So, we are hopelessly outnumbered. Of course, this\nrock of Orvieto is the most defensible position in Italy. Even with only\nour few hundred we could hold the Sienese off for some weeks, perhaps\neven months. But not indefinitely. The Holy Father knew that, which is\nwhy he left. The city will be taken and sacked. The people will suffer\ngreatly. If I am not killed in the fighting, I will surely be hanged.\nAnd after I and all the defenders are dead, the contessa will consider\nthe honor of the city satisfied and will make peace with the Sienese.\"\n\n\"Well, you will have done what you thought right,\" said Daoud, after the\npodesta had finished listing all these evil consequences. D'Ucello's\neyebrows twitched and his lips quirked, showing that he caught the\nirony.\n\nDaoud would enjoy this conversation more, he thought, if his feet did\nnot throb, if his legs did not ache, if his torn back did not burn as if\nhe were lying on hot coals, if his head were not swimming.\n\n\"I may hold this post at the contessa's pleasure, but she does not have\nthe right to tell me to die needlessly. And, as podesta, my first\nconcern is the welfare of Orvieto. If I can come to terms with the\nGhibellini, the city will be spared destruction.\"\n\nDaoud held up a hand. The pain of the gesture was excruciating.\n\n\"Are you not a loyal Guelfo? Are you not faithful to the papal cause?\nHow can you speak of coming to terms with the Ghibellini?\" What a\npleasure it was to goad d'Ucello.\n\nThe podesta squinted at Daoud, as if to see how serious his question\nwas.\n\n\"This is a Guelfo city, and normally I would take that side. But I have\nno personal feelings one way or the other. What I do care about is the\nresponsibility I have accepted, of governing this city. I carry out that\nresponsibility best by preserving it from ruin.\"\n\n_And at the same time saving your own life_, thought Daoud. _And biting\nyour thumb at the Contessa di Monaldeschi who has been treating you like\na servant. Oh, there are many reasons why you want to surrender to the\nSienese._\n\nBut Daoud was in terrible pain, and so tired that fatigue itself was now\nas much a torment as anything he had suffered earlier. He longed to cut\nthis conversation short.\n\n\"What has all this to do with me?\"\n\n\"To display my good faith to the Ghibellini, I have decided to free\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why should the Ghibellini care, one way or the other, what happens to\nme?\" said Daoud. Slowly he rolled over on his side, to make it easier to\nlook at d'Ucello. Pain flared in his arms and legs, in his back and\nchest. His hands barely had the strength to pull the blue cloak with\nhim.\n\n\"You still deny that you are of that party?\" d'Ucello asked.\n\n\"I am David of Trebizond.\"\n\nD'Ucello rose to answer a knock at the door. Daoud lifted himself on one\nelbow to see who it was. In the shadowed corridor a white-robed friar,\ntaller than d'Ucello, was peering in, trying to see Daoud.\n\n\"We are not quite ready for you, Fra Bernardino,\" said d'Ucello,\nhalf-closing the door.\n\n\"Wait, Signore,\" the Dominican said, putting out a pale hand. \"Cardinal\nUgolini has come here with men-at-arms and is demanding that you release\nthis man David to him at once.\"\n\nUgolini, here? Daoud felt a lightness in his heart. Freedom was that\nmuch closer.\n\n\"Make sure the cardinal is comfortable and is offered refreshments, Fra\nBernardino,\" said d'Ucello, \"and tell him he will not have to wait\nlong.\"\n\n_Better and better._\n\nWhen the door was shut, d'Ucello walked over to the bed and stared into\nDaoud's eyes. \"If I let you go, will you speak on my behalf to the\nGhibellini?\"\n\nDaoud smiled. \"In my capacity as a trader?\"\n\nD'Ucello clenched his fists. \"Damn you! You are too stubborn.\"\n\n\"So\"--Daoud kept the smile fixed on his face--\"you have arrested and\ntortured me for a night and a day. You very nearly did to me something\nso horrible, even now it hurts me to think about it. And you would have\ndone it, too, if the contessa's summons had not delayed you. Now,\nbecause you have stopped doing these things to me, you expect me to be\noverflowing with gratitude and glad to help you make peace with the\nGhibellini.\"\n\nD'Ucello smiled back. \"For my sparing you from torture, from mutilation,\nfrom death, you should be grateful, yes.\"\n\n_If he were another kind of man, he would have destroyed me with Greek\nFire and let this city be ruined while he fought the Sienese. In spite\nof what he did to me, this is a wise man, and he deserves to live and to\nrule here._\n\nBut Daoud could not resist another thrust. \"What I should do, if, as you\nthink, I have influence with the Sienese, is have them do to you what\nyou have done to me. And not spare you at the end.\" He felt himself\ngetting angry as he thought of all he had been through, even though he\nknew anger was foolish. \"I know where you keep your flask of Greek\nFire.\"\n\nD'Ucello's black eyes held Daoud's. \"Yes. You could do that. But I think\nI have come to know something about you during these hours you have\nsuffered at my hands.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I do not know what you are, but I know that you are much more than you\nseem to be. And you are not the sort who takes revenge on a man for\ndoing his duty.\"\n\nDaoud did not care to haggle anymore. \"Allow any messenger of mine\nfreedom to come and go through the city gates.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\nThe podesta was right, he thought. He would not seek revenge after\nd'Ucello surrendered to the Sienese any more than he would kill a\nprisoner of war. Men like Qutuz did that sort of thing, to satisfy their\nvanity. Men like Baibars did not. He thanked God for making him more\nlike Baibars.\n\nAnd he thanked God for bringing him alive and whole out of the valley of\ndeath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer first sight of Daoud was a cruel blow to Sophia's heart. His blond\nhair, dark with dirt and sweat, spread in lank locks on the pillow. His\nbloodshot eyes looked at her out of blackened lids. His lips were\ncracked. His face looked hollow, as if he had grown thinner just in the\nday d'Ucello had held him.\n\nShe ran to him across the tiled floor of Ugolini's reception hall.\n\nHe was alive, but how badly hurt was he? She prayed that when she lifted\nthe blanket that covered him she would see that his body was sound.\n\nHe raised his hands to her as she bent over the litter. She saw that the\nfingernails were blackened and bloody, and her own fists clenched as she\nfelt what they must have done to his hands. She slid her arms around his\nshoulders and pressed her face against his. Perhaps the men-at-arms and\nservants should not see the cardinal's niece embracing the trader from\nTrebizond, but at that moment nothing mattered to her but to hold his\nliving body in her arms.\n\nShe heard him gasp. She was hurting him. What a fool she was!\n\n\"Forgive my clumsiness, David. I am so sorry.\"\n\nHe gently squeezed her hand as she drew away from him. \"Your arms feel\nlike an angel's wings.\"\n\nUgolini called his steward, Agostino, and rattled off a list of\nnecessaries for treating Daoud's wounds--water, a pot and a brazier,\nclean cloths, medicine jars from the cardinal's cabinet.\n\nSophia walked beside the litter as Ugolini's men carried Daoud to his\nroom on the third floor. Her hand rested lightly on his shoulder. Her\nfeelings alternated between agony, as she imagined what he had gone\nthrough, and singing elation that he was back with her. With joy she\nfelt movement and life in the hard muscle under her fingertips.\n\n\"Tilia and I did what we could for you,\" she said when the men had\ndeposited him on his bed.\n\n\"I know,\" said Daoud. \"Ugolini told me about your visit to the contessa.\nHad she not sent for d'Ucello when she did--as you persuaded her to\ndo--I would be dead now.\"\n\nShe sat on the edge of his bed and put her hands over her face and wept\nfor joy. It had all meant something, her rushing to Tilia before dawn,\nher going with Ugolini to the contessa, her falling to her knees before\nthe old woman.\n\nAs the men-at-arms left, Ugolini came in with Agostino and two servants\nbearing a brazier and a tripod, pots of water, cloths, and jars of\nointments and powders from Ugolini's shelves. Two other servants brought\na table into Daoud's room, and Ugolini had the medications arranged on\nit.\n\n\"He also let me go because the Ghibellini from Siena are about to\nbesiege the city,\" said Daoud. \"He wants my help in surrendering to\nthem.\"\n\n\"A pity the Sienese could not have gotten here in time to catch the\nTartars and de Verceuil,\" said Sophia when the servants had left.\n\nUgolini looked up from the powders he was mixing for poultices and\nfrowned. \"Catch them? Why?\"\n\nSophia stared at Ugolini. Then the news had somehow missed him. She felt\nsorry for him. Even though Tilia was very much alive, this was going to\nbe a terrible shock.\n\nDaoud said, \"In the dungeon I heard something had happened at Tilia's\nhouse.\"\n\nUgolini's eyes grew huge. \"Tilia! My God, what was it?\"\n\n\"Tilia is well, Cardinal,\" Sophia said quickly. \"Luckily for her, she\nwas here when it happened.\" She wondered how much Daoud knew about what\nhad happened, and how he felt about it. Her heart still ached for poor\nRachel. Where was the child now, right at this moment? Somewhere on the\nroad to Perugia. Being abused, perhaps, by that beast of a Tartar.\n\n\"When _what_ happened?\" Ugolini cried. \"In the name of Christ and the\nVirgin, speak out!\"\n\nSophia told the cardinal and Daoud how she and Tilia had gone to Tilia's\nhouse, and of the death and destruction they had found there. It hurt\nher to see the anguish in their eyes. Especially Daoud's. He _must_ feel\na terrible guilt about having sent Rachel there in the first place. Now\nhe had to suffer that, along with pain d'Ucello had inflicted on him.\n\n\"The Tartars and de Verceuil!\" Ugolini shouted, shaking clenched fists.\n\"May God send a flood to drown them on the road to Orvieto! May all the\ndevils in hell roast them!\" He paced the floor furiously, his red robes\nrustling. \"I must go to Tilia at once,\" he cried.\n\n\"No,\" said Daoud. \"Too many people would see you.\"\n\n\"But she has no one to protect her.\"\n\n\"She has hired guards,\" said Sophia. \"And those who ruined her house are\ngone.\"\n\nDaoud's head fell back against the pillow, and his eyelids closed. His\nface looked masklike to Sophia, almost as if he were dead. She realized,\nwith sudden anxiety, that he might be suffering terribly, without\ncomplaint. That would be like him. And she and Ugolini stood here\ntalking. She must see to Daoud's hurts at once. He might have injuries\nwithin, injuries from which he could not recover.\n\n\"Send some of your trusted men-at-arms to protect Tilia,\" said Daoud\nwithout opening his eyes, his voice faint. \"Riccardo and some others. Do\nnot go yourself.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Ugolini, looking abashed. \"Even though you have been\ntortured, your head is sounder than mine. But, you understand, _I_ am\ntortured by the thought of what has happened to Tilia.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Daoud. \"And to her people. And to Rachel.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow you can tell me what happened to you,\" said Ugolini at the\ndoor. \"I will let you rest now.\" He drew a breath, hesitated, bit his\nlip. Sophia wished he would go.\n\nDaoud raised his head and opened his eyes. \"You want to ask something.\nWhat is it?\"\n\n\"Did you--did d'Ucello--learn anything?\"\n\n\"God willed that he learn nothing from me,\" said Daoud, sinking back\nagain.\n\n\"_Your_ will had something to do with that,\" said Sophia.\n\n_He held out against them. What a magnificent man._\n\nBut what price had he paid for his strength?\n\n\"God's will is my will,\" Daoud whispered.\n\n\"God be with you, then,\" said Ugolini, and left, pulling the door shut\nbehind him.\n\nDaoud's eyes opened. The sight of his eyes woke a warmth in her breast\nas if a small sun had risen inside her.\n\n\"Do you want to sleep?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Yes, with you beside me.\"\n\nJoy blazed up inside her at those words. She had been so afraid that\ntorture would somehow destroy his caring for her.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"Nothing would make me happier.\"\n\n\"But first I need you to wash and dress my wounds.\"\n\nDaoud gritted his teeth and winced as first she lifted off the purple\ncloak that covered him, then inch by inch drew the yellow tunic up from\nhis body and over his head. He groaned aloud when, with her propping up\nhis heavy body, he raised his arms.\n\n\"O Kriste!\" she whispered. She wept anew as her eyes traveled over the\ngolden body she loved and saw huge, broken blisters and patches of red\nskin; swollen black bruises the size of hen's eggs; long, deep\nlacerations filled with crusted blood; the many little black scabs of\npuncture wounds.\n\n\"When Lorenzo and the Ghibellini get here, we will have d'Ucello and his\ntorturers torn to pieces,\" she raged. She went to the table, folded a\nlinen cloth, and dipped it in the water.\n\n\"I do not hate d'Ucello,\" said Daoud as she began, very carefully, to\nclean his wounds. \"He has his work and I have mine. As for his\ntorturer--Erculio is his name--d'Ucello does not know it, but his\ntorturer is one of us.\"\n\nSophia's hand, moving the cloth lightly over a long, shallow cut that\nran across the smooth, almost hairless skin of his chest, paused. Was he\ndelirious?\n\n\"One of _us_? The torturer?\"\n\nDaoud looked amused. \"I do not know where Erculio comes from, but he is\na good servant of the God of Islam and of the sultan, who placed him\nthere for my protection.\"\n\n\"For your protection? You mean he would have killed you.\"\n\nHer body turned to ice as she faced the reality of how close she had\ncome to losing him.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Daoud. \"I thought I would never see you again.\" He reached\nout his arms, grimacing with pain. She put down the cloth and let him\nhold her. Her heart swelled up in her throat and tears burned her eyes.\n\nAnd suddenly, as if a curtain were lifted, she saw that life with this\nman would always be this way. Whenever she was with him, there would\nalways be a yesterday in which some miracle of good fortune kept him\nalive. There would always be a tomorrow in which he must face death yet\nagain.\n\nHer head rested on his chest for a moment; then she wiped her face and\nwent back to cleaning and covering his wounds. Never mind her pain.\nWhatever he was feeling must be much worse.\n\nHe told her how to make poultices for his burns using wet cloths and\npowdered medicinal herbs Ugolini had prepared. It was like what she had\ndone for his arrow wound, only now there were many more hurts to treat.\nSilently, in Greek, she cursed d'Ucello and cursed the torturer. She did\nnot care whether Daoud forgave them. She would never forgive what they\nhad done to her man.\n\nWhen he was in the cellar of the Palazzo del Podesta being tortured, had\nhe grieved at the thought of losing her, as she had sorrowed for him?\n\nShe worked her way down his body from head to foot, tying the poultices\nin place with strips of cloth. Thank God, they had done nothing to his\nmanly part. That was often the first place a torturer went for. When\nwould they make love again, she wondered. That depended on how long it\ntook him to recover. Perhaps weeks, perhaps even months.\n\nWhen she was finished with his front, he turned over with her help.\nAgain she could not hold back her tears. Pain, not bodily, but real just\nthe same, struck her at the sight of his tormented flesh. For a moment\nher eyes were covered with darkness. The skin of his back and buttocks\nhad been whipped away in large red slashes. She shook her head\nviolently, spoke a few more curses in her mind, and went to work. Daoud,\nwho had endured most of her healing efforts in silence, cried out when\nshe put a wet cloth on a torn spot.\n\n\"What more can you tell me about Rachel?\" he asked. She suspected he\nwanted to take his mind off the pain.\n\nShe repeated everything Tilia's women had reported, ending that looking\nout the windows they had seen Rachel riding off in a cart with the old\nFranciscan who interpreted for the Tartars.\n\n\"I am glad to hear that old priest still lives,\" said Daoud, sighing.\n\"Ah, Sophia, Rachel is a slave to that Tartar only because she had the\nill luck to cross my path. I have brought destruction to many, many\npeople.\"\n\nSlowly, painfully, he turned on his back again, with Sophia helping.\nLovingly she stroked the few patches of his skin that were not torn or\nburned or bruised.\n\nWhen he was settled, he looked up at her and smiled in what she thought\nwas a strange way. She did not see the cause of his smile at first,\nuntil he looked down at himself, and she followed his eyes. She saw that\nhis key of life had begun to raise itself.\n\n\"Daoud! After all you have been through?\"\n\n\"I want you, Sophia, _because_ of what I have been through. Because of\nwhat I nearly lost. I will tell you more tomorrow about what, God be\nthanked, did not happen. For now\"--he reached out a hand to her--\"come\nto me.\"\n\nShe understood. He must feel like a man who had come back from the dead.\nLife was more precious to him than ever--and love. Tired and pain-racked\nthough he was, he wanted this moment of being with her again, which must\nseem to him like a gift from God. And, indeed, perhaps that was exactly\nwhat it was.\n\nHe lay back on the bed, his tortured body naked except for the cloth\nwrappings tied over the worst of his wounds. His beautiful circumcised\nphallos pulsed as it grew larger. She wanted to be naked with him, and\nshe threw off her outer tunic, unbelted her red silk gown, and pulled it\nover her head. Her shift followed. Then she stepped out of the purple\nfelt slippers and stood before him, her arms held away from her body, to\nlet him see her.\n\nShe felt the warmth of her own desire for him spread through her.\n\nHe said, \"You are a spring that gushes out of barren rock. I thirst for\nyou.\"\n\nCarefully she climbed on the bed, straddling him. Slowly, so as not to\nhurt him, she lowered herself over him, guiding him into her with gentle\nfingers. A long sigh escaped him. She moved for both of them.\n\nThe instant after he groaned and reached his peak of love and pleasure,\nhe fell asleep, still lying on his back. He had just enough strength to\ncouple with me, she thought.\n\nShe rose from him and blew out the candles on the bedside table. The\nnight was cool, and she closed the casement windows of his room.\n\nThere was space between Daoud and the wall for her to lie beside him.\nShe stretched out there and stayed awake only long enough to kiss his\nbare shoulder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForcing himself to wake up seemed as much torture for Daoud as anything\nErculio had done to him. He could only lie there and struggle against\nthe agony he felt in every part of his body. His head ached. His tongue\nfelt like a lump of dried camel dung. His throbbing muscles and bones\nbegged him to sink back into unconsciousness. How long had he slept?\nOnly an hour or two, he was sure.\n\nThe yellow glow of a lighted candle filled the room. Lorenzo was\nstanding near the bed holding the candle, glowering at Daoud from under\nthick, dark brows as if he were angry at him.\n\n_Lorenzo._\n\nDaoud wanted to laugh and leap out of bed and throw his arms around\nLorenzo. He managed only to sit up, too quickly. Fires shot from his\njoints into his neck to coalesce in a burst of agony in the back of his\nhead. He did not want to cry out in front of Lorenzo, but a groan forced\nitself through his cracked lips.\n\nSophia, wearing her red silk gown and standing by the bed--_How did she\nget out of bed and dressed before Lorenzo got in here?_--took Daoud's\nshoulders gently and lowered him back to the bed.\n\nLorenzo set the candle on the table beside Daoud and sat beside him.\n\n\"What the devil did those bastards do to you?\"\n\nDaoud saw the rage in the penetrating dark eyes, and it delighted him,\nbecause Lorenzo was furious for his sake.\n\n\"Nothing that I will not recover from. More quickly, now that I see your\ninfidel face. Have you come here to parley with the podesta?\"\n\n\"Yes, Duke Rinaldo has sent his son, Lapo, and me to meet with d'Ucello\nhere at Ugolini's.\"\n\nLorenzo had accomplished everything Daoud asked of him, and more. His\ntimely arrival had saved Daoud's life. To think that Daoud had once\nwanted to be rid of him. Except for Sophia, he had never in his life\nfelt so happy to see anyone as this grizzled Sicilian.\n\nSophia said, \"I have tended your wounds enough for tonight, David. I\nleave you in Lorenzo's care.\" She smiled at Lorenzo and put her hand\nbriefly on his shoulder.\n\nAs she went to the door, Lorenzo scooped something from the floor,\njumped up, and handed it to her. \"I believe this is yours, Madonna.\" He\nheld out her red leather belt.\n\nSophia swept it from his hand. \"Thank you, Messere,\" she said coolly.\n\n\"Good night, Sophia,\" said Daoud with a smile. \"You have brought me\ngreat comfort tonight.\"\n\n\"Good night, David,\" she said, and shot him a burning look that he hoped\nLorenzo did not see.\n\nAfter the door closed behind her, Lorenzo chuckled softly as he sat down\nagain. \"Tending your wounds with her gown off, was she? And no light in\nthe room till I brought this candle in? You and she are not as discreet\nas you were before I left.\"\n\n_We could never fool Lorenzo_, thought Daoud ruefully.\n\n\"The pope is gone, the Tartars are gone, the French are gone,\" said\nDaoud. \"There is no one left in Orvieto that we need deceive. Find some\nsoft cloths on the table to bind my feet.\" Creating the barrier between\nhis mind and the pain, Daoud swung his legs over the edge of the bed.\nLorenzo stared at him, his mouth falling open.\n\n\"What in the name of hell are you doing? You cannot get up! What wounds\nare under those bandages?\"\n\n\"I do not mind the pain,\" said Daoud. \"I want to meet this duke's son.\nWhere is your army camped?\"\n\nLorenzo's grin stretched his thick black mustache. \"In the valley to\nthe north. You should see it. After I climbed up to the main gate of\nOrvieto I looked down and saw the hundreds of campfires twinkling. It\nwas as if the world had turned over, and I was looking down into the\nstarry sky.\"\n\nDaoud wished he could go to the city walls to see what Lorenzo had\ndescribed. But he had barely strength enough to walk from his room to\nUgolini's cabinet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour men--Daoud, Lorenzo, Ugolini, and Lapo di Stefano--sat around\nUgolini's worktable discussing the fate of Orvieto. The servants had\nmoved the table to the center of the cabinet and had replaced the\ncardinal's usual clutter of philosophical instruments with platters of\nmeat, loaves of bread baked fresh in the cardinal's kitchen, and trays\nof steaming pastries. Daoud had no appetite and was in too much pain to\neat.\n\n\"When does your King Manfred intend to come up from the south?\" Lapo\nasked Daoud. He twisted the carcass of a roasted pigeon between thick,\njuice-stained fingers. His nose had been broken in some accident or\nfight; air whistled in and out of the flattened nostrils. Daoud judged\nhim to be about twenty, the same age as Simon de Gobignon.\n\nAs far as Lapo knew, Daoud was an agent of the king of southern Italy\nand Sicily. It might have shocked him to discover that he was dealing\nwith a Muslim from Egypt.\n\nDaoud had to evade Lapo's question. He had no idea what plans Manfred\nhad, if any. He could only hope that when he met with Manfred at Lucera\nhe would be able to persuade him to invade the Papal States.\n\n\"King Manfred would come from the south much more quickly,\" Daoud said,\n\"if he could count on being recognized by the cities of the north as\nking of a united Italy.\"\n\n\"That must be between my father and him,\" said Lapo, and his breath\nwheezed through his nostrils as he bit into the pigeon's breast. \"After\nall, no such title exists. There has never been a king of Italy.\"\n\nAnd yet there easily could be, thought Daoud, seeing the shape of the\npeninsula in his mind. And if that single ruler were a man like Manfred,\nwhat a strong barrier Italy could be between the Abode of Islam and the\nbarbaric kingdoms of Christian Europe.\n\nBut in fact, thought Daoud, for all that Lapo di Stefano wore the\nGhibellino symbol, the black, two-headed Hohenstaufen eagle, on the\nbreast of his red silk surcoat, he and his father might still prefer\nthat Manfred stay where he was. As long as Manfred remained cut off\nfrom the northern cities like Siena by the band of the Papal States\nrunning across the center of Italy, the Ghibellini of the north could do\nas they pleased.\n\n\"When the French invade,\" said Daoud, \"a united Italy can keep them out.\nIf the cities of the north are divided, the French will take them over\none by one.\"\n\n\"How do you know the French will invade?\" Lapo asked. \"We have heard\nthat King Louis has no desire to wage war in Italy.\"\n\nDaoud was beginning to feel a strong dislike for this coarse young\nnobleman who seemed both very sure of himself and very ignorant. He was\nabout to reply when a man-at-arms entered and whispered to Ugolini.\n\n\"D'Ucello is here,\" Ugolini said.\n\n\"Have him wait below until we send for him,\" said Daoud quickly. He\nturned back to Lapo.\n\n\"I do not wish d'Ucello harmed.\"\n\nLapo stared coldly at Daoud. \"Who are you to give orders?\"\n\nLorenzo answered before Daoud could speak. \"Let me remind you, Signore,\nthat it was David of Trebizond whose gold made possible your capture of\nOrvieto.\"\n\nThere was too much conflict building up here, Daoud thought. \"No,\nLorenzo. Siena had the will, the fighting spirit. That was what made\nthis victory possible. I contributed only money.\"\n\nHe turned to Lapo. \"I do not give orders, I make recommendations based\non my knowledge of this town. I recommend that d'Ucello continue as\npodesta. If you leave enough men under his command, he will keep the\nfeuding families under control. Orvieto will prosper and pay you tribute\nthat will make this expedition worth your while.\"\n\n\"The army of Siena has marched against Orvieto because Orvieto is a\nGuelfo stronghold,\" said Lapo. \"We intend to replace the governments of\nall the cities near Siena with rulers favorable to us.\"\n\nDaoud thought he understood Lapo, gauging him as a man who had little\nexperience of war but who enjoyed bloodletting. He was probably\ndisappointed that the city might surrender without a battle, without an\nexcuse for looting and massacre. He might be hoping, as a substitute, to\nfind someone who could be put to death publicly in some hideous way to\ndemonstrate his power over the city.\n\n\"Of course you have come here to impose your will on Orvieto,\" he said\nquietly. \"But be grateful that you do not have to fight your way up the\nmountain. If d'Ucello were to choose to resist, your army would be\nmonths taking Orvieto. Let us be glad the podesta was sensible and\nsurrendered. Orvieto is a beautiful city. Its people will be eager to\nshow their gratitude to a conqueror gracious to them. The ease with\nwhich you win their hearts will in turn impress your own Sienese people\nwith your statesmanship. Of course, Orvieto was richer when the pope and\nmost of the cardinals were here. A pity you could not have marched your\narmy here sooner.\"\n\n_It would have been easier on me too._\n\nLapo's thick eyebrows went up. \"I heard that you were tortured by this\npodesta. And I can see you have been badly hurt. You want no revenge?\"\n\nDaoud fixed Lapo with a hard look and slowly shook his head. \"Revenge\ndoes not interest me.\"\n\n\"Just what does interest you, Messer Trader?\" The heir of Siena glowered\nat Daoud from under his heavy eyebrows. \"I do not trust a man who does\nnot care about revenge.\"\n\nRevenge? Was not his presence at the heart of Christendom a kind of\nrevenge for nearly two hundred years of Christian invasions of Muslim\nlands? Did it not make revenge all the sweeter that God's chosen\ninstrument was a descendant of those very crusaders who had been sent\nagainst Islam? This dense young nobleman could not conceive of the\nfantastic forms revenge could take.\n\n\"I act in the interests of King Manfred,\" Daoud said. \"It is in his\ninterest that Orvieto be part of the chain of Ghibellino cities in the\nnorth that limit the power of the pope. It is not in his interest--or\nyours--that Siena waste lives and money capturing Orvieto. The town can\nbe taken without a struggle if you come to terms with d'Ucello. And I\nrecommend that you leave him in place as podesta of Orvieto.\"\n\nLapo shook his head. \"How can I trust a man who would betray his own\ncity?\"\n\nDaoud felt his small remaining store of strength ebbing fast. He must\nfinish this quickly.\n\n\"You will leave your own force here to keep him in line, of course. You\nwill take prominent Orvietans back to Siena with you as hostages. But\nyou should understand that d'Ucello is not betraying his city. He is\nwilling to surrender because he knows that is best for Orvieto. Give him\na free hand and strengthen his militia, and he will govern the town well\nfor you.\"\n\nLorenzo said dryly, \"This paragon of podestas waits in Cardinal\nUgolini's reception hall to offer you the keys to the city of Orvieto.\nShall we invite him to join us, Your Signory?\"\n\nLapo di Stefano shrugged and waved a greasy hand. \"Send for the fellow.\nI will make my decision after I have seen him.\" He picked up another\nroasted pigeon and sank his teeth into it.\n\nAnd life or death for hundreds of people depended on how this ape\nhappened to choose in the next few moments, Daoud thought, as Lorenzo\nwent to the door and called a servant. Why did God put such men in\npositions of power?\n\nSoon there was a knock at the door, and Lorenzo went to it and admitted\nd'Ucello. The podesta's face was hidden by the dark brown hood of his\ncloak.\n\n_For all this man knows, I plan to have him killed_, Daoud thought,\nadmiring d'Ucello's courage in coming here.\n\n\"You come recommended to us as a man who can keep order in this city,\"\nsaid Lapo as d'Ucello took a seat.\n\n\"And we can think of no higher recommendation, since it comes from a man\nyou have just been torturing,\" said Lorenzo.\n\n\"This man has the strength of the old Romans,\" said d'Ucello, nodding\ntoward Daoud. \"He knows when to put a personal grievance aside for the\ngreater good.\"\n\nLapo said, \"If we were willing to let you remain as podesta of this\ncity, in return for your oath of allegiance to the Duke of Siena, how\nmany men would you need to keep the city under control?\"\n\n\"With two hundred men I could match the Monaldeschi forces,\" said\nd'Ucello. \"The Filippeschi have been crushed, and so badly that they may\ngo over to the Ghibellino party.\" His dark eyes lit up. He was relishing\nthe prospect of giving orders, Daoud thought, to the old houses that had\ntreated him like a servant.\n\n_Can it be that my legacy to Orvieto may be an improved government? I\ncertainly did not come here for that purpose._\n\nBut Daoud felt himself weakening. His overtaxed body would soon betray\nhim into sleep if he did not go to bed of his own accord.\n\n\"If you have no further need of me--\" he said. Lorenzo helped him stand,\nand leaning on him, he limped to the door.\n\n\"I owe you more than I can say,\" d'Ucello called after him.\n\n\"Pray to God that I do not decide to repay my debt to _you_,\" Daoud\nanswered. He did not look back, but he could imagine d'Ucello's small,\ngrim smile.\n\n\n\n\nLVII\n\n\nSimon and King Louis stood side by side on the yellow, sandy west bank\nof the Rhone River opposite Avignon. They had just crossed over the Pont\nd'Avignon, a long, narrow bridge of twenty-two arches. Avignon was a\ncompact city, encircled by butter-colored walls fortified with red\ncone-roofed towers. A prosperous city as well, Simon thought as he\nregarded the many church spires rising above the walls. Even during his\nbrief glimpse of the city upon his arrival late the night before, he had\nseen many great houses.\n\nHe looked at the tall, gaunt king, whose round eyes stared thoughtfully\noff into the cloudy sky.\n\nIt was lucky for Simon--if it were proper to think of a man's death as\nlucky--that the funeral of Count Raymond of Provence, father of Louis's\nQueen Marguerite, had brought the king here, so close to Italy.\nOtherwise Simon might still be traveling northward with the pope's\nletter. When he landed at Aigues-Mortes he had found the whole port\nabuzz with the news of Count Raymond's death and of the coming of the\nFrench royal family to bury him in state and settle the future of the\ncounty of Provence.\n\nA traveler from a foreign land looking at Louis would never imagine that\nhe was a king, Simon thought. A plain brown felt cap covered Louis's\nthinning gray hair, draping down one side of his head. His robe and a\ncloak of thin, cheap wool, dyed black, were not warm enough for this\nchill September morning. Perhaps, Simon thought, the penitential shirt\nof woven horsehair he wore next to his skin warmed Louis even as it\ndiscomforted him. He carried no weapon at his dull leather belt, only\nthe parchment scroll, the pope's letter, which Simon had given him the\nnight before. Louis's shoes were of the same sort of leather as his\nbelt, and the points of their toes were far too short to be fashionable.\n\nSimon felt overdressed beside the king, and resolved that from now on he\nwould try to dress more plainly.\n\nWith his long fingers, King Louis tapped the scroll tucked into his\nbelt. \"He afflicts me sorely, this Jacques Pantaleone, this Pope Urban.\"\n\n\"The pope afflicts you, Sire?\" Simon was surprised to see the king\nunhappy about the pope's message to him. He had expected Louis to be\noverjoyed at getting permission to deal with the Tartars.\n\nA sudden worry struck him. What if the king and the pope could not\nagree? All his work would have been for nothing--over a year of his\nlife, all the fighting and dying--to say nothing of the personal expense\nof paying forty Venetian crossbowmen for over a year and maintaining six\nknights--\n\nNow five, a grief-laden thought reminded him.\n\nYes, and what about Alain? Was his death to be for nothing?\n\nWorst of all, the accomplishment he had hoped would put him on the road\nto redeeming his family's honor would be no accomplishment at all. The\nyear wasted, lives wasted, the shadow of treason still lying upon his\nname and title.\n\nWhat joy he had felt only a little earlier this morning, knowing he\nwould accompany King Louis on his morning walk after Mass. Now his eager\nanticipation seemed like so much foolishness.\n\n_But, of all the men in the world, this is the one I would never want to\ndisappoint._\n\nWhatever Louis decided _must_ be right. But, dear God, let him not\ndecide to cast away the alliance.\n\nLouis said, \"Urban grants the thing I want most in the world, but only\nif I agree to that which I desire least. And I do not want to give in to\nhim.\"\n\n_Oh, God!_ The sky seemed to darken.\n\n\"What does he ask you to do, Sire?\"\n\nLouis sighed, a deep, tremulous expulsion of breath. \"He asks that the\nmight of France should be diverted into a squabble among petty princes\nin Italy, when Jerusalem is at stake!\"\n\n_It seems more than a squabble when you are in the thick of it_, thought\nSimon, remembering the night the Filippeschi had attacked the\nMonaldeschi palace.\n\n\"I cannot wait any longer to begin preparing for a crusade,\" Louis said.\n\"I want to return to Outremer in six years, in 1270. That may seem to\nyou a long time away, but for such a great undertaking as this it is\nbarely enough. It took me four years to get ready for the last crusade,\nto gather the men and supplies, and it will be harder this time.\"\n\n\"Why 1270, Sire?\" said Simon.\n\nLouis's head drooped and his eyes fell. \"To win my freedom I promised\nBaibars, the Mameluke leader who is now Sultan of Cairo, that I would\nnot wage war on Islam for twenty years.\"\n\n\"An oath to an unbeliever--\" said Simon.\n\n\"My royal word!\" said Louis fiercely. \"And besides that, France needed\ntwenty years to recover from the loss of thousands of men, men _I_ lost,\nto raise up a new generation of knights like yourself to take the cross\nagain.\"\n\nMany times during his boyhood years of living with the royal family,\nSimon had observed that the queen, or the king's brothers or his sons\nwould burst out in exasperation over Louis's insistence on adherence to\nsome principle, regardless of inconvenience or discomfort. In Simon's\neyes this had always meant that the king was a better Christian than the\nother members of his family. Now, seeing all his work and his hopes\npossibly ruined by the king's refusal to come to the pope's aid against\nthe Ghibellini, Simon was disturbed to feel a similar anger at Louis\narise within him.\n\nSimon stared at the man he loved so well, and saw that even though the\nking was talking of war, his thin, pale face was raised to heaven in an\nexalted, almost angelic look.\n\n\"But only the pope can proclaim a crusade,\" Louis said. \"Unless he does\nso, I cannot raise an army. And if we attack the Saracens in Egypt while\nthe Tartars strike through Syria, we will be invincible. But without the\npope's permission I cannot make a pact with the Tartars. In this letter\nhe gives that permission, but he makes it conditional on my involving\nFrance in his struggle with Manfred von Hohenstaufen.\"\n\nSimon was in despair. Louis would refuse, and the alliance would go\na-glimmering.\n\nLouis put a hand on Simon's shoulder. \"Be patient awhile, Simon. My\nqueen and my brother, Count Charles, will join us at breakfast. We will\ntalk together of all this.\"\n\nThe weight of Louis's hand sent a warmth all through him. But how could\nthe king expect him to be patient when he had so much to lose?\n\n\"Count Charles meets with you this morning?\" Simon asked. He had known\nthat Charles d'Anjou was in Avignon, but thought it his duty to carry\nthe pope's letter straight to the king, without first taking the time to\nseek out his mentor, the king's brother.\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Louis, \"we meet for another petty squabble. My queen was\nthe only heir of her father, the Count of Provence, and now the county\nis ours to dispose of. Marguerite wants to keep it in my immediate\nfamily, giving it to our son Tristan. But Charles wants it for himself.\nHe already holds Anjou, Aquitaine, and Arles. Add Provence to that, and\nhe would have a domain stretching from the Pyrenees to Italy. Whatever I\ndecide, I will offend either my brother or my wife.\" He shook his head.\n\"That is why it makes me so happy to talk to you, Simon. Young men\nunderstand what is really important so much better than their elders.\"\n\n\"Sire, I would do anything you asked of me.\" On a sudden impulse, Simon\nfell to his knees on the sand and seized Louis's bony hand and kissed\nit.\n\nLouis gripped his arms and raised him. Simon felt surprising strength in\nLouis's hands.\n\n\"Do not kneel to me, Simon,\" said the king, and Simon saw that his eyes\nwere brimming with tears. \"But it would mean so much to me if you, of\nall men, would take the cross.\"\n\n_If I, of all men--_\n\nSimon understood. Louis was thinking of Amalric de Gobignon, whose\ntreachery fourteen years earlier had been the final blow to Louis's\ncrusade into Egypt. The king's life had been shadowed ever since, Simon\nknew, by the memory of an entire army lost in the sands by the Nile and\nby his failure to win Jerusalem.\n\n_And no matter that I am not really the son of Amalric. If I inherited\nhis title, his lands, and his power, I must inherit his shame too. And\natone for it._\n\nLouis was still holding Simon's arms. The light blue eyes froze him with\ntheir stare.\n\n\"I have sworn to liberate Jerusalem. I will do it, or I will die. If I\ncannot have the help of the Tartars, I will still go. If every knight\nand man-at-arms in Christendom refused to go with me--if I had to go\nalone--I would still go.\"\n\n_God help me, you will never have to go alone as long as I live. If you\ngo on crusade, I will go too._\n\n_But there must be a Tartar alliance. There must!_\n\n\"Let us walk back over to the city and to breakfast, Simon,\" said Louis.\n\"Marguerite and Charles will be waiting for us.\"\n\nAs they walked to the bridge of Avignon, preceded and followed at a\ndiscreet distance by the king's guards in blue and silver tunics, Simon\nfelt himself torn. He wanted to please King Louis, and he wanted to\nredeem the name of his house. But must he live out his whole life\nexpiating the crimes of Amalric de Gobignon, who was not even his real\nfather?\n\n_Roland and Nicolette laid a heavy burden on me when they brought me\ninto the world_, he thought bitterly.\n\nAgain he thought of Sophia. If he could persuade her to come and dwell\nwith him at Gobignon, he could forget the shame of Amalric and live\nsimply and in peace, a happy man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince high matters of state were to be discussed here, over breakfast in\nthe private dining room of the palace of the bishop of Avignon, the\nservants had been dismissed. King Louis, Queen Marguerite, Prince\nTristan, Count Charles, and Simon were alone together. The large round\ntable was piled high--a whole roast duck, a dozen boiled eels, blocks of\nhard cheese, a pyramid of hard-boiled eggs, bowls of pickled fruits,\nstacked loaves of fine white bread, trays of cheese pastries, and\nflagons of wine.\n\nSimon sliced the eels and put oval white slices on each person's\ntrencher, while Prince Tristan carved and distributed the duck. As they\ndid so, King Louis read aloud the pope's letter granting him permission\nto conduct a crusade jointly with the Tartars in return for French help\nagainst the Ghibellini.\n\n\"Your next crusade will make me a widow,\" Queen Marguerite said, her\nround face white and her fists clenched on the table. \"As your last did\nto so many other women.\"\n\nTristan, a sturdy, ruddy-faced youth a few years younger than Simon,\nwent around the table pouring red Rhone valley wine into everyone's cup\nbut his father's. Louis poured his own wine from another pitcher, and\nSimon saw that it was a pale pink. It must be more water than wine.\n\nLouis's long, thin fingers, carrying a slice of eel to his mouth as\nMarguerite spoke, stopped in midair, and he slowly put the meat back on\nhis trencher. But he said nothing.\n\n\"Do not speak so, madame,\" said Charles as he used a long thumbnail\ndarkened by the dirt under it to break and peel the shell from a\nhard-boiled egg. \"It brings ill luck.\" Simon heard the venomous\nundertone in his voice.\n\nEven though this was the first time they had seen each other since\nCharles sent Simon to Italy to guard the Tartars, the Count of Anjou had\nhardly spoken to Simon this morning. Hurt, Simon wondered how he had\noffended Charles.\n\nMarguerite, tall and stout, her head wrapped in a linen coif held in\nplace with a net of pearls, stood with a sudden, graceless lunge that\nknocked her chair over. Tristan, blushing, went to pick it up, and she\ncaught his hand.\n\n\"What need of ill luck when I have a husband bent on destroying himself,\nand he has a brother who is only too happy to help him do it?\" She\nturned away from the table, pulling Tristan after her. \"I take with me\nthis boy, lest he spoil your pleasant dreams of crusading by reminding\nyou of how and where he was born.\" With long, angry strides she was at\nthe door. Tristan stepped in front of his mother to open the door for\nher.\n\n\"Good morning to you, madame,\" said Louis softly, still looking down at\nthe slices of boiled eel that lay before him. The door slammed behind\nthe queen and her son.\n\n\"What did she mean by that?\" Charles said, sounding quite unconcerned by\nthe queen's outburst.\n\n\"Do you not remember, brother?\" said Louis. \"Marguerite gave birth to\nTristan alone in Egypt, while you and I were prisoners of the Mamelukes.\nShe has never forgotten how terrified she was.\"\n\nTo mask his embarrassment, Simon took a big swallow of the red wine. It\nwas thick and tart, and burned in his chest as it went down. He never\nenjoyed wine this early in the day. He wished he could drink heavily\nwatered wine, as King Louis did, but he feared people like Uncle Charles\nwould think him a weakling.\n\nCharles popped the entire hard-boiled egg into his mouth, and spoke\naround it. \"It is best that the queen has left us. I do not understand\nwhy she dislikes me so.\"\n\n\"I do not understand why you and she dislike each other,\" said Louis\nsadly.\n\n\"We will talk of that another time.\" Charles picked up the scroll of the\npope's letter and shook it at Louis. \"You must let me go to the aid of\nthe Holy Father.\"\n\nCharles's fingernails were quite long, Simon knew, because he never\nbothered to trim them. His hair and stubble of beard were thick and pure\nblack, while Louis's face was smooth and his hair, what was left of it,\nwas a silvery gray. Charles was broad-shouldered and sat erect; Louis\nwas slender of frame and slightly stooped. It was hard to believe that\ntwo such different-looking men were brothers. But they did both have\nwhat were said to be the Capet family features--they were very tall,\nwith long faces, large noses, and round, staring eyes, Louis's blue and\nCharles's brown. They both dressed plainly, but Charles dressed like a\nfighting man, in leather jerkin and high boots that he stretched out\nbefore him as he sat sideways to the table.\n\nSimon used his dagger to cut himself a chunk of white bread--baked\nbefore dawn in the bishop of Avignon's ovens--from one of the loaves in\nthe center of the table. He hoped it would soak up the wine that still\nsmoldered in his stomach.\n\nLouis said, \"All my life, people have been trying to get me to make war\non the Hohenstaufen family. Our mother, may she rest in peace. One pope\nafter another. Now you. All call the Hohenstaufen mortal enemies of\nChristendom. I am still not persuaded.\"\n\nCharles laughed scornfully. \"Brother! Who do you think incited the\nSienese to take Orvieto? And in this letter His Holiness says Manfred is\npreparing to march north against him.\"\n\nSimon wondered if Sophia was still in Orvieto. Ever since he had heard\nthe news that a Ghibellino army had captured the city on the rock,\napparently without a battle, worries about Sophia's safety had gnawed at\nhim. He wished desperately that he could be wherever she was, to protect\nher. And how he longed just to see her, to hold her in his arms, to kiss\nher beautiful golden face, to taste her lips, the color of sweet red\ngrapes.\n\nLouis said, \"Manfred is only trying to protect his crown, which the pope\nwants you to take from him.\"\n\nSimon prayed that Charles would persuade Louis, but he had little hope\nof it. He had many times seen the king, his mind made up, gently\nobstinate, never raising his voice, never losing his patience,\nwithstanding the arguments of his whole family and court.\n\nThen Simon, listening to the argument, became aware of something he had\nnot noticed earlier. Neither of the royal brothers had mentioned the\npope's poor health. Probably because neither of them had seen for\nhimself how sick Pope Urban was.\n\nHe waited for a pause, then spoke. \"Sire, Uncle Charles, the Holy Father\nseemed to me to be very gravely ill by the time I left him. He told me\nthat he expects to die soon. If he does die now, will not this\npermission for the alliance with the Tartars die with him?\" Simon\npointed to the letter.\n\n\"Yes, it will,\" said Louis frowning, \"We will have to start all over\nagain with the next pope.\"\n\n\"Manfred could try to influence the election of the pope,\" said Simon\nurgently. \"Or he could try to control the next pope by taking him\ncaptive.\"\n\nLouis rubbed his high forehead. \"It has been done before, more than\nonce.\"\n\nCharles's large, hairy hand clamped down on Louis's forearm. \"Simon has\nhit upon the key to all this, brother. Think how powerful the Ghibellini\nare in Italy now. They control Florence, Siena, Pisa, Lucca, and now\nOrvieto. With all those Ghibellino cities to the north of the Papal\nStates and Manfred to the south, is it not obvious what Manfred is\nplanning?\"\n\nCharles struck Louis's arm again and again with the flat of his hand to\nemphasize his point. No one else would dare touch the king like that,\nthought Simon.\n\n\"Obvious to you, perhaps,\" said Louis wryly. \"I see only a man trying to\nprotect himself.\"\n\n\"The instant Pope Urban dies, Manfred and his allies will attack. He\nwill surround and seize the entire College of Cardinals. He will force\nthem to elect the pope of his choice. We will lose the Papacy.\"\n\n\"We do not _own_ the Papacy.\"\n\nCharles leaned back, laughing without mirth. \"Well, Manfred will own the\nPapacy if we do not stop him. And then you can forget about your Tartar\nalliance. You can probably forget about crusading altogether. A pope\ncontrolled by the Hohenstaufen would probably forbid you to crusade,\nunder pain of excommunication. Do not forget, it was Manfred's father,\nEmperor Frederic, who made a treaty with the Sultan of Cairo.\"\n\nSimon watched Louis closely to see what effect Charles's words were\nhaving. It was obvious that they were sinking in. A troubled frown drew\nLouis's pale brows together and tightened his mouth. Simon's heart began\nto beat faster as his hopes rose.\n\nCharles went on. \"If I go now, I go at the pope's invitation. And if\nUrban dies--\"\n\nLouis made a reverent sign of the cross. \"If it be God's will, Charles.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, if it be God's will that this pope dies, I will already be in\nItaly,\" Charles said. \"I can be in Rome, athwart Manfred's path, and he\nwill not be able to intimidate the College of Cardinals when they elect\nthe next pope. You must let me go into Italy to protect our interests.\nOr else give up your dream of Jerusalem.\"\n\nA long moment of silence passed, Louis staring into Charles's eyes.\n\nLouis held up a finger. \"I will not declare war on Manfred. If you go,\nthis is entirely your doing, and that of the pope.\"\n\n_We've won! The king has given in!_ Simon, wild with joy inside, forced\nhimself to sit silent.\n\nCharles did not look as pleased as Simon felt. \"But, if you don't\ndeclare war, where will I get the knights and men?\"\n\nLouis held up a second finger. \"You will get them yourself. I will not\nprovide them. You will have to hire them. And if Manfred beats your\narmy, I will not send more men to rescue you.\"\n\nCharles shrugged. \"Well, I have the best tax collectors in Europe.\"\n\nLouis raised a third finger. \"You will forget about Provence.\"\n\nCharles looked outraged. \"Forget about--\" he sputtered.\n\nLouis raised a finger. \"Charles, I will not let you have both Sicily and\nProvence. You want too much.\"\n\nCharles sighed. \"Very well. Let Provence go to Tristan. You have put me\nin a position where I will desperately need the taxes Provence would\nyield. But I will make do somehow.\"\n\n\"I am sure you will,\" said Louis. \"If you have to sell all the clothes\nfrom all the backs in the lands you now rule.\"\n\nLouis thought a moment, and then turned to Simon, who, glowing inwardly,\nleapt to his feet.\n\n\"Yes, Sire!\"\n\nLouis looked startled at Simon's vehemence. \"I will write two letters\nfor you to take to Perugia. One for the reigning pope, who, I pray, will\nstill be Pope Urban. In that I will give my permission for the Count of\nAnjou to accept the crown the pope has offered him and to make war on\nManfred.\"\n\nHe stopped, sighed, and shook his head.\n\nTurning to his brother, he said, \"I do this with great sorrow and\nmisgiving, Charles, but I fear I have no choice.\"\n\nThe Count of Anjou said nothing, but Simon saw his chest rapidly rising\nand falling with excitement.\n\n\"Should God take Pope Urban, Simon, you will hold the letter, sealed,\nuntil a new pope is elected and then give it to him. The other letter,\nin the event Pope Urban dies, will be for Cardinal de Verceuil. You\nmentioned that Manfred might try to influence the election of the next\npope. Fourteen out of twenty-one cardinals are French, and if they vote\ntogether, they can elect a pope. I shall recommend a candidate they can\nunite behind. Again, I do not like to do this, because a king should not\ninterfere in the election of a pope. Should Pope Urban live to read the\nfirst letter, you will not give the second letter to Cardinal de\nVerceuil, but will burn it, still sealed, and see that not a trace\nremains.\"\n\nCharles shrugged. \"The Hohenstaufen did it again and again.\"\n\n\"They _tried_ to do it,\" said Louis, \"and that is one reason that they\nand the popes are such enemies. But I do it for the same reason I allow\nyou to go to Italy, Charles. To prevent a greater calamity and to\naccomplish a greater good.\"\n\n\"And who will your choice for pope be, brother?\"\n\nLouis stood up. \"I do not want to compromise myself even more by letting\nthat be known. I will write the name in my letter, and the letter will\nbe sealed.\"\n\nHe stood up. \"If you defeat Manfred, may God have mercy on you, Charles.\nYou will be a king in your own right, and you will know what it is to\nhave to make decisions like this.\"\n\nSimon felt sure that making royal decisions would never be the agony for\nCharles that it was for Louis.\n\nCharles stood up, too, then dropped to his knee and pressed his forehead\nagainst his brother's pale hand. \"God bless you, Louis. I promise you,\nthis is one decision you will always be happy to have made.\"\n\n_I will always be happy he made it_, Simon thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, as they walked together through the gray stone halls of the\nbishop of Avignon's palace, Charles struck Simon on the shoulder. The\nblow threw Simon off stride, reminding him how strong Charles was.\n\n\"You did it, boy, you tipped the balance for me when you pointed out\nwhat might happen if the pope dies,\" Charles said with a grin. \"I was\nquite angry with you until then.\"\n\n\"I had a feeling you were, uncle,\" he said.\n\nCharles's nail-studded boots clicked on the stone floor of the corridor.\n\"Have you forgotten that if it were not for me, you would still be\ngrowing cobwebs at Gobignon?\"\n\n\"No, uncle, I have not forgotten.\"\n\n\"Then why did you take the pope's letter to my brother without telling\nme about it?\"\n\nSimon felt a dull heat in his face. Somewhere in the back of his mind he\nhad always known that Uncle Charles would want to be told first about\nany messages passing between the pope and the king. But, feeling it\nwould be wrong, Simon had pretended to himself that he knew no such\nthing.\n\n\"It was my duty to take it promptly to the king,\" said Simon, looking\nstraight ahead.\n\nCharles suddenly stopped walking. \"Simon,\" he said, forcing Simon to\nstop, turn, and look at him.\n\n\"Simon, do not let your idea of duty make you forget your loyalty to me.\nI helped raise you as a boy. I gave you this opportunity to bring honor\nto your house. I will be offering you even greater opportunities.\"\n\n\"I have not forgotten, uncle,\" Simon said again.\n\n\"I do not suppose you know how to unseal and reseal a royal document?\"\n\nSimon felt his blood heat with anger.\n\n\"No, uncle.\" He did not feel strong enough to denounce Charles, but he\ntried to put disapproval into his voice. \"I have never heard of anyone\ndoing such a thing.\"\n\n\"Pas mal. Too bad.\" Charles's round eyes were heavy-lidded with\ncontempt. \"Well, I must leave at once to begin squeezing the money for\nthis campaign out of my subjects. Especially since I have given up my\nclaim to Provence. I cannot wait around to see who my brother thinks\nshould be pope. I am sure he will make a good choice.\"\n\n\"I am sure he will,\" said Simon frostily.\n\n_I pray God it is not de Verceuil himself._\n\nAgain the heavy blow on his shoulder, both comradely and threatening.\n\"Well, then. In the future when you have important news, make sure I am\nthe first one to hear it.\"\n\nSimon felt hotter still. Uncle Charles was supposedly helping him win\nback his honor, and yet was proposing that he betray the king's trust.\nHe had admired Uncle Charles all his life because he seemed to be\neverything a great baron should--commanding, strong, warlike,\nvictorious, loyal to the king, the Church, and the pope. But he had\nalways had the uneasy feeling that Charles d'Anjou was not a _good_ man\nin the sense that King Louis was. And he had always kept in the back of\nhis mind his mother's warning, _He uses people_. He had felt that unease\nstrongly over a year ago, the day Charles asked him to lead the Tartars'\nmilitary escort. Now he knew there was good reason for that uneasiness.\n\n\"Yes, uncle.\" Simon had no intention of obeying, but since Charles had\nno right to ask such a thing, there was no harm in misleading him. After\na year in Italy and all he had been through, Simon found he feared his\nUncle Charles less than he had. And trusted him less.\n\nAnd now, he thought, it would be back to Italy. Back to see his efforts\nbear fruit, as the alliance of Christians and Tartars became a reality.\nPerhaps he would escort the Tartars to France, to King Louis, so they\ncould draw up their war plans together.\n\nBut, best of all, he would seek out Sophia in Perugia. He would propose\nmarriage to her again. Now she would believe him, now that she'd had\ntime to think about everything he had said to her. Sophia. Seeing her in\nhis mind, he felt as if he walked among the angels.\n\n\n\n\nLVIII\n\n\nManfred von Hohenstaufen sat at a table at the far end of the colonnaded\naudience chamber, his pale blond hair gleaming in the candlelight.\n\n\"Come forward,\" he called to Daoud and Lorenzo. He beckoned to them, the\nwide sleeve of his green tunic falling away from his arm.\n\nTheir booted feet echoed on the long floor of polished pink marble.\nDaoud's stomach felt hollow. He _must_ persuade Manfred to carry the war\ninto the north at once.\n\nA dark green velvet cloth, hanging to the floor, covered the table at\nwhich the king of southern Italy and Sicily sat. The tabletop was strewn\nwith pens and open rolls of parchment. Two chamberlains in dark brown\ntunics hovered at Manfred's back. He wrote quickly on one parchment\nafter another, and handed them to his two assistants. Even though it was\na sunny morning outside, this chamber had few windows, and Manfred, to\nsee his work, needed candelabra at each end of the table.\n\nWhen Daoud and Lorenzo reached his table, he waved in dismissal to the\nchamberlains, and they bowed and left, carrying armloads of scrolls.\nSeeing Manfred at work, Daoud felt a powerfully protective impulse\ntoward him. Manfred was not _his_ king, but he had become a worthy ally,\nand Daoud was prepared to fight Manfred's enemies. To die, if need be,\nfighting them.\n\n\"An old friend of yours wants to greet you, David,\" said Manfred, his\nbright smile flashing.\n\nDaoud saw no one. In a candlelit alcove behind Manfred hung a painting\nof a red-bearded man in mail armor partly covered by a black and gold\nsurcoat. It was not painted on the wall, but seemed to be on a separate\npiece of wood with a gilded border, which was hung on the wall. The man\nlooked a bit like Manfred, and Daoud suspected it must be his father,\nthe famous Emperor Frederic. There was an idolatrous look about the\npainting and the way it was displayed that made Daoud uneasy. It\nreminded him a bit of the saint's image Sophia had kept in her room at\nOrvieto.\n\n\"David of Trebizond!\" came a cry from beside Manfred. Manfred reached\ndown and helped a bent, monkeylike figure scramble up to stand on the\ntable.\n\n\"God blesses our meeting, Daoud ibn Abdallah--this time,\" said the dwarf\nErculio.\n\nHe grinned at Daoud through his spiky black mustache. At the sight of\nhim Daoud winced at the memory of all the pain this little man had\ninflicted on him. He still felt some of that pain, especially in his\nfeet, despite the tawidh's hastening of the healing process. But Daoud\nalso felt a sudden warmth that reminded him of the first time he had\nseen the little man, here at Lucera. Deformed in body and soul, required\nto do unspeakable things, Erculio had still found a way to serve God.\n\n\"If my lord Daoud wishes to kill me, I am at his service,\" said Erculio\nin Arabic. \"I have finished the work our sultan sent me to do in Italy.\"\n\nDaoud found himself smiling in spite of himself. \"You would have saved\nme from a mutilation worse than death, Erculio. I cannot hate you for\nthat. You did your work well.\"\n\nErculio looked like a spider when he bowed, his head touching the\ntabletop, his elbows bent upward. \"I am my lord's slave.\"\n\nHe was the more admirable, Daoud thought, because despite being so\ndeformed, he had found important work to do in the world.\n\n\"How is your former master, d'Ucello, faring with the Sienese in\nOrvieto?\" he asked Erculio.\n\nErculio spread his hands wide. \"Alas! The podesta is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead?\" It was hard to believe. Daoud heard Lorenzo's startled grunt\nbeside him.\n\n\"The Contessa di Monaldeschi never forgave him for surrendering to the\nSienese without a fight,\" Erculio said. \"Vittorio, the Monaldeschi heir,\nstabbed him to death in his office and then escaped into the hills. He\nis probably seeking asylum with the Church leaders in Perugia.\"\n\n\"I would rather have heard that d'Ucello killed Vittorio,\" said Lorenzo.\n\"Then there would be some sense in the world.\"\n\nDaoud felt a pang of sorrow, and was surprised at himself. After all,\nhad not d'Ucello arrested him and subjected him to a day and a night of\nhorrible torment, with the threat of worse hanging over him? But he\nremembered the podesta as a man of rare ability, who would have ruled\nOrvieto well, given a chance. His death was a waste.\n\nManfred said, \"Erculio has told me of your arrest and your sufferings at\nthe hands of the podesta of Orvieto. I want to hear more about that. But\nlet us speak now of Perugia. What is Ugolini doing?\"\n\n\"Lorenzo and I escorted Cardinal Ugolini to Perugia and left him there,\"\nDaoud said. \"He planned to block the election of a new pope by keeping\nthe Italian cardinals united behind himself.\" He paused a moment. Now\nshould he bring up his conviction that Manfred must march northward\nbefore a new pope was elected?\n\nBut while he hesitated, Manfred spoke. \"What of Sophia Karaiannides?\"\nManfred looked sharply at Daoud, the sapphire eyes intent. \"Why did you\nnot bring her back here with you?\"\n\nJealous anger stabbed Daoud. Sophia had spoken little of Manfred, but\nDaoud had long ago realized that she and Manfred must have been lovers.\nHe had decided not to think about that. Now Manfred was wondering what\nhad happened between Sophia and Daoud, and perhaps wanted Sophia back;\nDaoud could read it in Manfred's tone and the look in his eyes.\n\nDaoud tried to see Manfred as Sophia might have. Intensely--one might\nalmost say blindingly--handsome, strong, graceful, his brilliant mind\nattractively decked out with elegance and wit, learned but carrying his\nlearning lightly, skilled in all the courtly arts and graces. What woman\ncould resist such a man?\n\nBut Manfred must have tired of her, as such men did, who had access to\nany woman they wanted. Perhaps his queen, or some new love of his, had\ninsisted that Sophia be sent away. And once she was gone, he had\nrealized what he had lost.\n\n_Too late now, Manfred._\n\nBut, he reminded himself, he must not let Sophia come between himself\nand Manfred.\n\nDaoud put out his hands, palms up. \"Sophia is with Cardinal Ugolini. The\ncardinal's courage fails him at times. We thought it best for one of us\nto stay and give him strength. And Sophia can help him run his household\nand entertain the men of influence he must see.\"\n\nManfred nodded, a small smile twitching his blond mustache. \"Yes, she\nwould be good at that.\"\n\nDaoud thought of Simon de Gobignon and felt a flash of hatred for him.\nBut he must report about him, too.\n\n\"She has captured the heart of a young French nobleman, the Count de\nGobignon, who commands the Tartars' military escort. When Charles\nd'Anjou invades Italy, de Gobignon will surely be one of his captains.\"\n\n\"_When_ Charles d'Anjou invades Italy? And a moment ago you said _when_\na pope of the French party is elected.\"\n\nDaoud was about to reply, but Manfred raised a hand for silence. He rose\nfrom his high-back chair. With a glance, as if for reassurance, at the\nportrait of the red-bearded man hanging behind him, he strode out in\nfront of the table with his hands clasped behind his back. Daoud and\nLorenzo made way for him. He walked the length of the marble floor to\nthe door at the end of the hall. The dwarf Erculio sank down\ncross-legged on the tabletop, his long arms clasped around his knees,\nwatching Manfred sombrely.\n\nDaoud prayed, _Oh, God, help him to judge wisely_.\n\n\"King Louis has always held Charles back,\" Manfred said, turning\nsuddenly to face Daoud and Lorenzo. \"Louis does not believe that the\npope should set Christian rulers against one another.\"\n\n_And help me to advise him well._\n\nDaoud gathered his thoughts. The success of his mission in Italy\ndepended on persuading Manfred to choose the right course. His heart\nbeat harder. He tried to speak with all the assurance he could muster.\n\n\"Sire, there are enough French cardinals to elect the next pope. They\nare bound to choose a man who will give King Louis what he wants--the\nalliance between Christians and Tartars. And that same pope will surely\noffer your crown to Charles d'Anjou as Urban did. If Louis has the\nalliance he wants above all else, he will not stand in Charles's way.\"\n\nManfred sighed and turned away. \"So, you think war is certain.\"\n\n_Accept it!_ Daoud cried out to Manfred in his heart. _Hesitate no\nlonger._\n\n\"Yes, once a pope is elected,\" Daoud said. \"But you can act before that\nhappens. Use the time Ugolini is gaining for you. March north now, Sire,\nwhile your enemies are without a head. Join forces with your Ghibellino\nallies in northern Italy--Siena, Florence, Pisa, and the rest. Surround\nthe College of Cardinals and you can force them to elect a pope of your\nchoice. Or scatter them. Three-fourths of them are needed for the\nelection of a pope. You might be able to stop the election altogether.\"\n\nManfred's back remained turned. Daoud looked at Lorenzo. He could not\nread Lorenzo's expression; the Sicilian's mouth was hidden beneath his\ngrizzled mustache. But Lorenzo shook his head slightly, as if to say\nthat Daoud was not having the effect he wanted. At that, Daoud felt\nhimself waver toward despair. He commanded himself to stand firm.\n\nManfred walked back to the table. He stood before Daoud, his hands still\nclasped behind him. His face wore a haunted look. The cheerful\nself-confidence Daoud had always seen before was gone.\n\n\"The north is a quagmire this time of year.\"\n\n\"For your enemies as well as for you,\" Daoud said. \"And they do\nnot--yet--have anything like the strength you can muster. You can call\nup your vassals here in a few weeks' time. When Charles gets a summons\nfrom the new pope, he will then have to gather his troops in France and\ncross the Alps into Italy. By the time he is ready, you could have all\nof Italy under your control. And there would be no pope to give\nlegitimacy to his invasion.\"\n\nManfred snorted and turned away. Daoud, Erculio, and Lorenzo watched him\npace.\n\nHe came back and said, \"No. I do not trust those you call my allies in\nthe north. They opposed the pope, but neither do they want to be ruled\nby me. If I were to try to make myself king of Italy, they would turn\nagainst me.\"\n\nProbably true, Daoud thought, remembering the reluctance of Lapo di\nStefano, the heir of Siena, to recognize Manfred's kingship over all of\nItaly.\n\nBaibars would be in the north like lightning, though. He would welcome\nthe bad weather, because it would impede his foes while he himself would\nsimply not _let_ his own troops slow down because of it. And if any of\nhis allies even thought of betraying him, he would kill them. But that\nwas Baibars. This king, Daoud remembered, had at first not wanted to\nhelp him with his mission in Orvieto because it might provoke a war.\n\nManfred, he saw, kept raising objections because he really wanted to be\nleft alone to enjoy what he had. He showed no interest whatever in\nconquering all of Italy. He was the enlightened ruler of a civilized,\nprosperous land, and he probably would not go to war until the enemy was\non his border.\n\nThough Daoud felt for Manfred and his wish to be at peace, he knew that\nno ruler could refuse the duty of war. Peace could be achieved only by\nconquering the enemies of peace. Every great ruler of Islam from the\nProphet to Salah ad-Din and Baibars had been a warrior on horseback.\n\nDaoud's heart felt like a lump of lead. He saw so clearly that with one\nstroke they could end the danger of a union between Tartars and\nChristians and save Manfred's kingdom.\n\nHe sighed inwardly. He had tried his best and failed.\n\nHe had no choice but to accept that. But acceptance was not surrender.\nYou surrendered only to the will of God. You accepted things as they\nwere, but struggled to make them better.\n\n_The potter does not sigh for better clay, but works with what God puts\nin his hand_, Sheikh Saadi said.\n\nManfred turned away from Daoud, walked around the table with another\nglance at the portrait, and sat down. He frowned at a parchment that lay\nbefore him, as if wishing to end the conversation.\n\nDaoud said, \"Then, Sire, let us at least prepare to defend ourselves as\nbest we can.\" He untied a small leather bag from his belt and went over\nto the desk. Manfred looked up, his blond eyebrows lifted.\n\nDaoud said, \"Allow the sultan of the lands of Islam, who feels himself a\nbrother to you, to come to your aid with this gift.\" He upended the\nleather bag over the table, and a flood of tiny lights spilled out.\nErculio gasped and drew back from the small pile of precious stones.\n\nManfred stared in wonder. \"This is enough to pay and equip enough\nknights and men-at-arms to double the size of my army. Your sultan gives\nwith a great heart.\" He looked at Daoud with more warmth that Daoud had\never seen in those cold blue eyes. \"Or is it in fact you who give?\"\n\n\"My lord the sultan commanded me to use this wealth carefully, and to\nhelp you if your enemies should attack.\"\n\nManfred said, \"These, then, remain of the jewels I sent you with to\nOrvieto? Twelve? You are a remarkably good steward, Daoud. I should put\nyou in charge of my treasury.\"\n\nDaoud inclined his head respectfully. \"I hope you will put me where I\ncan serve you better, Sire.\"\n\n\"And where is that?\"\n\n\"Sire, my work here is far from done. Give me a unit of your army to\ncommand. Let them be, if you permit, fighting men of my own faith.\"\n\n_And I may yet kill the Tartars and rescue Rachel._\n\nManfred's face fairly glowed. He picked up one of the jewels from his\ntable, a large precious topaz of a warm golden color. He took Daoud's\nhand, laid the rare stone on his palm, and closed his fingers over it.\n\n\"This is yours. Use it to recruit and supply a troop of your own in my\nservice. They should count themselves blessed by God to have a Mameluke\nto train and lead them.\"\n\n\"It is I who am blessed,\" Daoud said.\n\nHe looked at the stone in his hand. It was a shade lighter than the\ncolor of Sophia's eyes.\n\nHe bowed again to Manfred. At last he could fight as he preferred to,\nleading troops in open battle. As a Mameluke.\n\nSmiling to himself, he stroked his chin.\n\n_And at last I can let my beard grow._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_A letter from Emir Daoud ibn Abdallah to El Malik Baibars\nal-Bunduqdari, from Lucera, 19th day of Rabia, A.H. 663:_\n\n    Next to the Byzantine Empire this kingdom of southern Italy and\n    Sicily is the most civilized of Christian nations. That is to say, a\n    Muslim might almost be comfortable here. In fact, many are.\n\n    The chief interests of King Manfred's courtiers are falconry,\n    poetry, dalliance with beautiful women, and philosophical\n    disputation. My lord will note that I do not mention warfare.\n\n    King Manfred seems to hope that some intervention by God or fate or\n    chance will make it unnecessary for him to take the field against\n    Charles d'Anjou.\n\n    Christian warriors generally prefer to wait for their enemies to\n    come to them, reasoning that a small force of defenders can defeat a\n    large force of attackers. That is why there are castles everywhere\n    in Europe, even in the cities of Europe. Their wars against us, that\n    they call crusades, are an exception, and perhaps, too, they have\n    learned something from the failure of those invasions.\n\n    But this is also an exceptional moment. The Guelfi and the French\n    are not ready to fight, and Manfred could win everything if he were\n    to act now.\n\n    I tried to persuade him to invade northern Italy and bring the\n    Papacy under his control, but he would have none of it. So we must\n    await Charles, and defeat him when he comes. After that Italy will\n    lie open to Manfred. Then for his own future safety he will have to\n    place the pope under his influence.\n\n    But how I long for a day like that when I rode behind my lord\n    Baibars to destroy the Tartars on the field at the Well of Goliath.\n\n    It appears to me now that God intends the destiny of the Dar\n    al-Islam to hinge on one great battle. If Manfred defeats Charles\n    d'Anjou in Italy, the Franks will withdraw to lick their wounds. The\n    French losses will deprive Louis of the troops he needs for his\n    crusade against us. But, if Manfred falls, then the pope and the\n    Franks, made greedy by victory, will be eager to join forces with\n    the Tartars and extend their empire into our sacred lands of Islam.\n    I will do my best to see that the Franks do not defeat Manfred, and\n    if I fail I hope not to live to see what comes after.\n\n    All is in the hands of God, the All-Powerful, the Compassionate.\n\n\n\n\nLIX\n\n\nCold and steady, the rain drummed on Simon's wide-brimmed leather hat.\nHis wool cloak had been soaking up water all day, and lay heavy as an\niron plate on his body. It was not yet sunset, he knew, but the rain so\ndarkened the streets of Perugia that he despaired of finding his\ndestination.\n\nHe rode along the wide main street hunched over against the chill rain,\nSordello and Thierry on either side, their two spare horses and their\nbaggage mule trailing behind. People hurried past without looking up.\n\n\"There it is!\" Sordello shouted through the rain.\n\nSimon's first thought on seeing the Baglioni palace was, _If only we had\nbeen in a place like that when the Filippeschi attacked_.\n\nRain and darkness made it hard for him to see it in detail, but lighted\ntorches and candles glowing inside the windows limned its general shape.\nThe square central tower loomed high above the surrounding city, its\nstone face ruddy in the glow from the upper windows of four cylindrical\ncorner turrets. The palace was surrounded by a high outer wall, and\nSimon supposed there was an expanse of bare ground between the wall and\nthe main building. To him, the palace looked more like a great French\ncountry ch\u00e2teau than a noble Italian family's town house.\n\nStreamers of purple cloth, betokening mourning, were draped from one\nturret of the gatehouse to the other, the rain-soaked ends flapping\nacross the arch of the gateway.\n\nThe tall wooden gate, sheltered from the rain by a pointed arch, was\nadorned with painted carvings of the lion, symbol of the Guelfi, and the\ngriffin, symbol of the city of Perugia. Simon and Sordello pounded on\nthe gate, and men-at-arms admitted them. Simon unstrapped a flat leather\ncase from his saddle and then left Thierry to unload and stable the\nanimals. He and Sordello hurried through the rain to the front door of\nthe palace.\n\nSimon identified himself to the steward, who conducted him, with much\nsolicitude about the bad weather, to the sala maggiore of the palace.\nIn the great hall, Simon was glad to see a fire of logs burning on a\nstone hearth under a chimney opening. He headed for it, throwing his\nsopping cloak and leather hat to the stone floor. Let the servants pick\nthem up. Riding all day in the rain had made him irritable.\n\n\"Simon!\" Friar Mathieu was shuffling toward him, leaning heavily on a\nwalking stick. The old Franciscan's painfully slow movements alarmed\nhim. Simon put his arms about him, but gently.\n\n\"Are you feeling worse, Father?\"\n\n\"The weather is reminding my bones that they were cracked not long ago.\nI have a fire on the hearth in my room upstairs. Come up with me and you\ncan get out of those wet clothes.\"\n\nSimon sent Sordello to the kitchen and, still carrying the leather case,\nfollowed Friar Mathieu up a long flight of stone steps.\n\nWrapped in a blanket, seated on a bench before the fire in Friar\nMathieu's chamber with a cup of hot spiced wine in his hand, he began to\nfeel more comfortable, and he told the old priest about his journey back\nto Italy from Avignon.\n\n\"King Louis dismissed me on the twentieth of September. I paid fifty\nlivres for a fast galley to Livorno. Then we rode our horses almost to\ndeath through the hills to get here. It took us less than two weeks.\nVery good time, but not good enough.\"\n\nSimon paused. He remembered the old pope so vividly, writing letters\nfuriously and dispatching them hither and yon, feeling surrounded by\nenemies on all sides and knowing he was going to die. He had so wanted\nto bring the Holy Father good news. Now Pope Urban was no more, and\nSimon was deeply disappointed.\n\n_But surely he is happier out of all this turmoil. He is with God and at\npeace now._\n\n\"And what news do you bring?\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\nSimon leaned toward him enthusiastically. \"The pope's last wish has been\ngranted! King Louis has agreed to let his brother Charles make war on\nKing Manfred.\"\n\nInstead of looking delighted as Simon had expected, Friar Mathieu\nsurprised him by sighing and staring into the fire.\n\n\"Are you not pleased?\" Simon prodded him.\n\n\"Pleased about a war?\" Friar Mathieu's eyes were sad under his\nsnow-white brows.\n\nSimon felt as if his chair had been pulled out from under him and he had\nbeen dumped on the floor. His whole being had been focused on bringing\ngood news to Perugia.\n\n\"But Father Mathieu, this means that the alliance of Tartars and\nChristians is approved. By Pope Urban, anyway.\"\n\nNow that Pope Urban was dead, did that mean anything? He hesitated,\nconfused.\n\nFriar Mathieu sighed again. \"I want the Tartars to embrace Christianity.\nI want the holy places liberated. But this warfare in Italy seems to me\na false turning in the road. However--neither you nor I can stop the\nmarch of events. What is it you are carrying?\"\n\nSimon unbuckled the fastenings of the leather case and took out a\npackage wrapped in silk. \"Two letters written by King Louis. One was for\nPope Urban. The other is for de Verceuil if Pope Urban should die.\"\n\n\"You will have trouble delivering either one.\"\n\n\"The one for Pope Urban I will keep as the king ordered me, until a new\npope is elected. But the other one--why? Where is de Verceuil?\"\n\n\"Locked away with the other cardinals in the Cathedral of Perugia,\ntrying to make himself pope.\"\n\nThe thought of Paulus de Verceuil as supreme head of the Church made\nSimon's lip curl. \"Pope? Not him!\"\n\n\"He has the support of about half the French cardinals,\" Friar Mathieu\nsaid, shaking his white beard. \"The cardinals are supposed to be in\nabsolute seclusion, with no messages going in or out, but the servants\nwho bring them their meals report things in both directions. The other\ncardinals lean to Gerard de Tracey, cardinal-bishop of Soissons. A\nformer inquisitor.\" Friar Mathieu made a sour face.\n\n\"What of the Italians?\"\n\n\"Amazingly, despite the rumors about his heresy and sorcery, Ugolini has\nfour Italian cardinals voting for him. The servants say he has promised\nlarge sums of money to those four. The other three Italian votes are\ngoing to Piacenza. That must include Ugolini's vote, since the rules\nforbid a cardinal to vote for himself. Voting for old Piacenza is just a\ngesture, of course. He probably has less than a year of life left to\nhim. But until one or two Italians can be persuaded to vote for a French\ncandidate, no Frenchman can get the necessary two thirds.\"\n\n\"Are there not fourteen French cardinals to seven Italians?\" Simon\nasked.\n\n\"Yes, but right now there are only twenty cardinals in conclave\naltogether. One of the French cardinals is in England on a diplomatic\nmission, sent by Pope Urban before his death. So, even united, the\nthirteen French would be one short of two thirds. And they are far from\nunited. It could take years to elect a new pope.\"\n\nYears! Simon was horrified. What a disaster! Without a pope, the\nquestion of the alliance would languish. The Tartar ambassadors might\nyet be assassinated, or just die. Hulagu Khan might die. Even King\nLouis, God forbid, might die, and the next king would probably not be\ninterested in crusading.\n\nSimon, for his part, had pinned his hopes for the restoration of his\nfamily honor on the success of the Tartar alliance. A new pope must be\nelected, and soon.\n\nHe carefully took the two scrolls out of their silk wrappings. Both were\ntied with red ribbons and sealed with blobs of red wax which King Louis\nhad stamped with his personal seal, a shield bearing fleurs-de-lis.\nSimon held up the one addressed \"His Eminence, Cardinal Paulus de\nVerceuil.\"\n\n\"We must try to get this letter to de Verceuil at once. It names King\nLouis's choice for the next pope. It could end the deadlock.\"\n\nFather Mathieu stroked his white beard thoughtfully. \"Exactly the sort\nof letter the rule against messages was instituted to keep out. A king\nattempting to influence a papal election.\" The old Franciscan took the\nscroll in one hand and tapped it against the palm of the other. \"But I\nthink for the good of the Church and for the success of our own mission\nwe had better get this letter to de Verceuil at once. King Louis's\nchoice cannot be worse than de Verceuil, de Tracey, or Ugolini.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Simon eagerly. \"But how do we get the letter to him?\"\n\nThe old Franciscan pushed himself to his feet. It hurt Simon to see how\nslow and painful his movements were. Damn that devil in black who had\ntried to kill the Tartars!\n\nThe Tartars! He had thought they were well guarded enough, and that it\nwas safe to leave them while he carried Urban's letter and the king's\nreply. But if the question of the alliance were to drag on, the foes of\nthe alliance would try again to strike at them. Fear clutched at his\nheart.\n\n\"Are the Tartars here in this palace?\" he called after Friar Mathieu,\nwho was hobbling out of the room holding King Louis's scroll.\n\n\"Oh, yes. The Baglioni family have given them a whole quarter of the\npalace. They are well enough, though they hate being trapped indoors by\nthe weather and by the need to keep them under guard. John Chagan has\nwith him a young Jewish girl named Rachel, whom he kidnapped from a\nbrothel in Orvieto. The girl was an orphan, and she has been terribly\nabused. She is virtually their prisoner.\"\n\nSimon's mouth twisted. \"And we want to ally ourselves with such men.\nHow can such things go on in the same city with the Sacred College?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu shook his head grimly. \"Nothing I have said has made any\ndifference. De Verceuil insists that the Tartars must have whatever they\nwant, even though it will damn their souls. They are Christians, after\nall. If John dies with this girl on his conscience, he will go straight\nto hell.\"\n\nSimon sighed. \"Little de Verceuil cares about that.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"Well, we must get the king's letter to\nhim.\"\n\nHe hailed a passing servant. \"Tell the cook I want Cardinal de\nVerceuil's supper sent up to me before it is brought around to him at\nthe cathedral. Tell him to be sure there is bread with the cardinal's\nmeal. The cardinal wants plenty of bread. And\"--he turned to\nSimon--\"what is your equerry's name?\"\n\n\"Thierry d'Hauteville.\" What on earth was Friar Mathieu planning? Simon\nprayed that, whatever it was, it would work and get the letter through.\n\n\"Find Thierry d'Hauteville and have him bring the tray up to me.\"\n\nThierry had borrowed a fresh tunic and hose from one of the Baglioni\nfamily servants. His dark hair, which usually hung in neat waves, was\nwild and tangled from being rubbed dry.\n\nHe carried Verceuil's dinner, a mixture of pieces of lobster and\nvenison, with bread and fruit, on a circular wooden tray with a\ndome-shaped iron cover. Friar Mathieu took a knife and sliced lengthwise\nthrough the hard crust of a long loaf of bread. Using his fingers, he\nhollowed out the bread, giving chunks of it to Simon and Thierry and\neating the rest of it himself.\n\n\"The Lord hates waste,\" he said with a chuckle. \"This is white bread,\ntoo, such as only the nobility enjoy.\"\n\nAs Simon watched, holding his breath, Friar Mathieu laid King Louis's\nscroll lengthwise in the bread and closed it up carefully. The line of\nthe slicing was barely visible. To secure the package, he took a loose\nthread from one of his blankets, tied it around the loaf, and covered\nthe thread with a bunch of grapes.\n\n\"Now, Thierry. Normally one of the cardinal's servants takes his meals\nto him, but tonight you will. We want as few people as possible to know\nabout this letter. If Cardinal Ugolini found out about it, he would make\nsuch a scandal of it that he might even end up being elected pope!\"\n\n\"Might not Ugolini see de Verceuil reading the letter?\" Simon asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"Each cardinal eats and sleeps in a\ncurtained-off cell built along the sides of the cathedral's nave. De\nVerceuil and King Louis will be quite alone together.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following afternoon the sky was heavily overcast, but the rain had\nstopped. From the northwest tower of the Palazzo Baglioni, Simon could\nsee that Perugia was a much bigger city than Orvieto. Like most Italian\ncities, it was built on a hilltop. But while Orvieto was flat on top of\nits great rock, Perugia stood on sloping ground, and the town had\nseveral levels.\n\n\"Simon!\"\n\nSimon turned to see Friar Mathieu's white head emerge from the trapdoor\nopening to the tower roof. As he hurried over to give the old man a hand\nup, his heartbeat speeded up. The wait for news must be at an end. When\nhe saw Friar Mathieu smiling, he started grinning himself.\n\n\"The letter did it,\" the priest said cheerfully. \"We have a pope, and it\nis neither de Verceuil nor de Tracey nor Ugolini.\"\n\nSimon felt like shouting for joy.\n\n\"Who, then?\"\n\n\"Why, the person named in the letter you brought, of course,\" said Friar\nMathieu teasingly.\n\n\"Spare me this riddling, Father,\" Simon begged. \"Not now. This means too\nmuch to me.\"\n\n\"All right, all right.\" Friar Mathieu patted Simon on the shoulder.\n\"This morning at Tierce I joined the crowd at the cathedral to see the\ncolor of the smoke of the burning ballots from the chimney of the\nbishop's palace. If the king's letter had its effect, the smoke should\nbe white, but it was not.\"\n\nSimon's heart sank. Had he misunderstood Friar Mathieu?\n\n\"Black smoke, then? But you said they did elect a pope.\"\n\n\"No smoke at all. The people were puzzled, and so was I, and we all\nwaited to see if anything would happen. I was about to give up and leave\nwhen the doors of the cathedral opened, and there stood little Cardinal\nUgolini, with most of the Sacred College behind him. He looked as if he\nhad been eating rotten figs. When I saw that, I knew the news must be\ngood. As cardinal camerlengo, he announced, 'We _believe_ we have a\npope.' Well, you can imagine, that took everyone aback. He explained\nthat the one elected was not present, and his name could not be\nannounced until he had come to Perugia and had officially accepted. Then\nthe cardinals came down the steps one by one. Most of them looked happy\nto be out of the cathedral after a week of imprisonment, but de\nVerceuil and de Tracey looked as ill as Ugolini. De Verceuil has come\nback to the palace now, so you had better walk carefully.\"\n\nSimon remembered that Friar Mathieu had said the cardinals had elected\nthe man named in King Louis's letter. But apparently the man was _not_\nyet elected. Simon felt uneasy. The chosen one was not even in Perugia.\nToo much could go wrong. He searched his brain. Friar Mathieu had said\nsomething last night about one of the cardinals being absent. Which one?\n\n\"Who is the man they elected?\" Simon cried. The way Friar Mathieu was\ntelling this was maddening.\n\nSmiling, Friar Mathieu said, \"That is why I did not come to you at once.\nA priest in de Verceuil's entourage is an old friend of mine, and I\nwaited until I could get the rest of the story from him.\"\n\n\"Could the letter I brought make such a difference?\" Simon exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, de Verceuil sent Thierry away before looking inside that loaf of\nbread. His servant and his secretary, who were living with him, stood\noutside his cell and heard groans and cries of rage from within. De\nVerceuil threw his dinner on the floor and stamped out of his cell.\nWhile the servant cleaned the cell, de Verceuil visited and spoke\nsecretly with each of the other French cardinals in turn.\n\n\"This morning, when it came time for them to vote, de Verceuil rose and\nsaid, 'Ego eligo Guy le Gros'--I elect Guy le Gros. Then each of the\nother French cardinals said the same thing after him.\"\n\n_Le Gros!_ Simon thought. _Le Gros is the cardinal who is not here._\n\nSo, that was who King Louis wanted. Simon remembered meeting him at Pope\nUrban's council a year ago, a stout, genial man with a long black beard.\nDe Verceuil had mocked him because he had once been married and had\ndaughters. De Verceuil would have to eat that mockery now.\n\nWhat did this mean for the alliance? Le Gros must be favorable. Why else\nwould King Louis have chosen him?\n\n\"But why no smoke?\" Simon asked.\n\n\"When a cardinal acclaims a candidate orally after a deadlock, and the\nothers follow suit, it is called election by quasi-inspiratio. Because\nit is as if the cardinals have been divinely inspired. No ballots are\nneeded, so there is nothing to burn. In this case they were inspired by\nKing Louis, with some help from you and me.\n\n\"When two Italian cardinals--Piacenza, who knew he was too old to be\npope for long, and Marchetti, who was always opposed to Ugolini--joined\nthe cry for le Gros, it was all over. Ugolini collapsed in tears, but he\nwas revived enough to make the arrangements to send to England for le\nGros to come in haste. Everybody was sworn to silence, and Ugolini went\nout to make the public announcement. Of course, despite the secrecy, all\nPerugia knows it will be le Gros.\"\n\n\"But the alliance?\" Simon asked anxiously.\n\nFriar Mathieu reached out and took his hand. \"We will have to wait until\nle Gros is officially crowned. But we can count on one of his first acts\nbeing a call for an alliance between the princes of Christendom and the\nkhans of Tartary. And right after that will follow a declaration that\nManfred von Hohenstaufen is deposed and Charles d'Anjou is the rightful\nking of southern Italy and Sicily.\"\n\nA feeling of triumph swept Simon.\n\n\"Once the alliance is secured,\" he said, \"I can really believe that I\nhave the right to be the Count de Gobignon.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Friar Mathieu. \"Is that the assurance you need?\" He spoke in\na dubious tone that made Simon uneasy. \"Well, then, I hope for your sake\nle Gros gets here from England all the sooner. Even though I do not look\nforward to the war he will unleash.\"\n\n_I care nothing about this war between Charles d'Anjou and Manfred von\nHohenstaufen_, Simon thought. His work would be done when he delivered\nthe Tartars, with the pope's blessing, to King Louis.\n\nAnd at the same time, he thought, he might bring Sophia to France. In\nhis present happy mood, the thought of her was like a sunrise. If there\nwas to be war in Italy, if Charles d'Anjou was to invade her homeland of\nSicily, she might be all the more grateful to him for offering her a\nmarriage that would take her away from all that.\n\nHe must arrange a rendezvous with her at once.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLuckily, Simon thought, the rain that plagued Umbria this time of year\nhad let up for three days, and the roads leading out of Perugia into the\ncountryside were fairly dry. He would have braved a flood or a blizzard\nto see Sophia again, but it pleased him that there were blue breaks in\nthe gray dome of cloud overhead. After meeting on a road northwest of\nPerugia, Simon and Sophia had ridden to a woodland lake that reflected\nthe blue in a darker tone on its rippling surface.\n\nSimon felt himself breathing rapidly with excitement as he surveyed the\nlake shore. It seemed almost miraculous that Sophia was standing beside\nhim.\n\nThey were at the bottom of a bowl of land. Big rocks that looked as if\nthey might have rolled down the surrounding hillsides lay on the shore\nof the small lake. The floor of the wood was thick with brown leaves.\nThis forest, Simon thought, probably belonged to some local nobleman.\nMost of the countryside around here was farmland.\n\nEven though denuded by autumn, the masses of trees on the opposite shore\nlooked impenetrable, ramparts of gray spikes frequently interrupted by\nthe dark green of pines. The place had all the privacy he had hoped for.\nHe prayed that this time alone together would not end in disaster as\ntheir last meeting outside Orvieto had.\n\nHolding Sophia's arm and guiding her down to the edge of the lake gave\nSimon a warm, pleasant feeling. A tremor ran through his hands when he\ngrasped her slender waist and lifted her--how light she felt!--to perch\non a big black boulder.\n\nShe laughed gaily, and her laughter was like church bells at Easter.\n\nHe scooped up leaves and piled them at the base of the rock. When he had\na pile big enough for two people to sit on, he spread his cloak over it.\nHe held out his hand, and she slid from the boulder to the leaves.\n\nHe went foraging in the wood and quickly gathered an armload of broken\nbranches and a few heavy sticks. He made a ring of stones near the\nwater's edge and piled the branches within it, putting leaves and small\ntwigs that would catch fire easily under the larger pieces of wood. He\nadded some dried moss and took flint and steel out of a pouch at his\nbelt, struck sparks several times, and got the moss to smoke. He blew on\nthe glowing spots till a bright orange flame appeared. In a moment the\npile of branches was afire.\n\nSophia crawled to the fire and held her hands out to its warmth. Simon\nsat beside her, so close their shoulders touched. He felt a pang of\ndisappointment when she moved just a bit away from him.\n\n\"How comfortable you've made us!\" she said, sounding a little surprised.\nShe was very much a city woman, Simon thought. She seemed to know little\nabout the country, and he had noticed that she never looked entirely\nrelaxed on horseback.\n\n\"Are you surprised that I know how to make a fire in the woods?\" He felt\ninordinate pride at being able to show off this small skill to her.\n\n\"I did think you relied on servants to do that sort of thing for you.\"\n\n\"A knight may not always have equerries or servants to help him. I know\ndozens of useful things that might surprise you. I can even cook and sew\nfor myself.\"\n\n\"Marvelous! The woman you marry will be fortunate indeed.\"\n\nAs soon as she said it, the light went out of her eyes and she looked\nquickly away. An uneasy silence fell over them. Her obvious dismay threw\nhim into despair. Again he remembered their struggles and her tears--and\nhis own--that morning in the pine forest outside Orvieto.\n\nAfter a pause, with an obviousness that sunk him into an even deeper\ngloom, she changed the subject. \"Uncle told me all about what they did\nwhen the pope died. He was with the Holy Father right to the end. Just\nbefore he died, Pope Urban said, 'Beware the Tartars, Adelberto.' I\nwould have thought Uncle made that up, but he says all the pope's\nattendant priests and servants heard it. Uncle says it proves Pope Urban\nhad changed his mind at the end about that alliance you are all so\nworried about.\"\n\n\"Maybe the pope was warning your uncle that the Tartars are angry at him\nfor all the trouble he has caused them,\" said Simon, forcing himself to\ncomment on something that, at the moment, did not interest him.\n\nHe refused to worry about whether Pope Urban had a deathbed change of\nheart. How beautiful her eyes were, such a warm brown color! He had\neverything planned out for both of them. She had only to agree. He would\npresent her first to King Louis. How could the king disapprove his\nmarriage to a cardinal's niece? And with the king's support, no one else\ncould object. Besides, Nicolette and Roland would love her; he was sure\nof it.\n\nShe went on. \"Anyway, Uncle said that the pope's chest filled up with\nblack bile, and that was what killed him. The pope's priest-physician\nfelt for a heartbeat, and when there was none, Uncle took a silver\nhammer and tapped the pope on the forehead with it.\"\n\n\"Really!\" Simon had no idea they did that. The strange scene interested\nhim in spite of his longing for Sophia.\n\n\"To make sure he was dead. And then Uncle called his name--his baptismal\nname, not his name as pope--'Jacques, are you dead?' He did this three\ntimes. And when the pope did not answer, he said, 'Pope Urban is truly\ndead.' And he took the Fisherman's Ring off the Pope's finger and cut it\nto bits with silver shears. And with the hammer he broke the pope's\nseal. So they must make a new ring for the new pope.\"\n\n\"When Cardinal le Gros is made pope, he will confirm the alliance of\nChristians and Tartars,\" said Simon, eager to put a finish to the topic\nand bring the conversation back to the two of them.\n\nSophia, her hands folded in her lap, lovely hands with long slender\nfingers, looked sadly toward the lake. \"I suppose that pleases you.\"\n\n\"Why not be happy for me? My work is nearly done.\"\n\n_And_, he wanted to add but dared not, _we can be married_.\n\nShe turned to look at him, her eyes troubled. \"Uncle says the new pope\nwill call Charles d'Anjou to invade Italy and make war on King Manfred.\nWill you be with the invaders?\"\n\n_Count Charles will surely expect me to join him_, Simon thought. Well,\nhe would simply tell Uncle Charles that he had no wish to spend any more\ntime in Italy.\n\n\"When the alliance with the Tartars is settled, I mean to go home.\"\n\nHe was about to tell her again that he wanted her to come with him, but\nshe spoke first. \"You know this Count Charles well, do you not? How soon\ndo you think he will march into Italy?\"\n\nSimon wanted to talk about their future, not about Charles d'Anjou's\nplans for war with Manfred. But he tried to answer her question.\n\n\"He is pressing his people for money now. Then he must gather his army.\nAnd it can take months to move an army from the south of France to\nsouthern Italy. With winter coming on, he will probably wait until next\nyear to cross the Alps. My guess is he'll be here in Italy next summer.\"\n\nShe was about to speak again, probably to ask another question about\nCount Charles. He quickly broke in.\n\n\"What I told you last time--that I am a bastard and that the last Count\nde Gobignon was not my real father--does that make you less willing to\nmarry me?\"\n\nHer face squeezed together, as if a sharp pain had struck her. \"You are\nnot going to start talking about marriage again, Simon?\"\n\nHer words were like a knife wound in his chest. While he searched for\nwords, his eyes explored the steep brown hills that surrounded this\nsecluded lake. Their tops were veiled in mist, like his past.\n\n\"I have never stopped thinking about marrying you. Sophia, you are the\none person in the world who can make me happy.\" He reached over into her\nlap and took her hand. It felt cool and smooth.\n\n\"I could never, never make you happy,\" she said. \"You know nothing about\nme.\"\n\nWhy was she always saying that? What was there to know about a woman who\nhad lived a quiet life in Sicily, was widowed at an early age, and had\ncome to live with her cardinal uncle?\n\n\"I know enough.\" His eyes felt on fire with longing. \"And you know\nenough about me to see that the differences between our families do not\nmatter. You know what I am. And we care more about each other than we do\nabout your uncle opposing what my king wants.\"\n\n\"Oh, Simon!\" Now there were tears running down her cheeks, but she did\nnot try to pull her hand away. It pained him to see how this was hurting\nher, though he did not understand why it should.\n\nShe said, \"You are telling tales to yourself if you imagine we could\never marry. You should not even think of it. Whatever your mother did,\nyou are still the Count de Gobignon. You are almost a member of the\nFrench royal family.\"\n\n\"I am sure Cardinal Ugolini does not agree that your family is so\nobscure,\" Simon said. \"It is time I talked to him about this. Then you\nwill believe I mean it.\"\n\nShe struck her hands against his chest. \"No, no! You must not do that.\nDo you not realize how upset he is about this war, and how he feels\ntoward the French? If he even knew that I had been alone with you today,\nhe would force me to go back to Siracusa at once.\"\n\nThe feel of her hands on him, even to hit him in reproof, excited him.\n\n\"I would not let that happen,\" he said gravely.\n\nHe heard wild geese flying southward calling in the distance. Their\ncries made this place seem terribly lonely. Even though the little lake\nwas only a short ride from Perugia, he had seen no sign of a human being\nanywhere.\n\nThe fire was burning low. He went to gather more wood.\n\nSophia frowned at him when he came back. \"What did you mean, you would\nnot allow my uncle to send me away?\"\n\nHe leaned closer, seizing both of her hands in his. The pleasure of\nholding her hands rippled through him like a fluttering of angels'\nwings. In his exalted state he was moved to utter extravagant words.\n\n\"I mean that if you were to leave Perugia, I would ride after you. I\nwould fight any men your uncle had set to guard you. I would take you\nback to Gobignon with me, and there with you inside my castle I would\ndefy the world.\"\n\n\"Oh, Simon!\"\n\nHis words sounded foolish to him after he spoke them aloud. Yet men, he\nknew, had done such things--Lancelot--Tristan--if the old songs were to\nbe believed. How better to prove his love than to commit crimes and risk\ndisgrace for her?\n\nShe was crying again. She put her hands over her face. Why, he wondered,\nwhen he declared his love for her and told her he wanted to marry her,\ndid it make her so unhappy? If she did not care for him, she should be\nindifferent or angry. Why, instead, did she cry so hard?\n\n_It must be that she wants me but cannot believe it is possible._\n\nThe sight of her slender body shaking with sobs tore at his heart. He\ncould not hold himself back; even if she fought him again, he must put\nhis arms around her. He reached out to hold her. She fell against him.\nShe felt wonderful in his arms, solid enough to assure him that this was\nno dream, yet light enough to allow him to feel that he could do\nanything he wanted with her.\n\nHe remembered how angry she had been in the pine forest outside Orvieto\nwhen he had tried to make love to her. Though he might be eaten up with\nlonging for her, he must just hold her and be glad she allowed him to do\nthat.\n\nShe raised her tear-streaked face and kissed him lightly on the lips.\n\nThe soft pressure of her lips on his made his arms ache to hold her\ntighter. But he fought the feeling down.\n\n\"Why do you cry so hard when I speak to you of love?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Because no one has ever loved me as you do,\" she said. She rested her\nhead against his chest, and he stroked her hair. His eyes lingered over\nthe curves of her breasts. He wanted to drop his hand from her hair to\nher breast. He felt the yearning to touch her breast as a pain in the\npalm of his hand.\n\n\"But you have been married,\" he said. \"Did not your husband love you?\"\n\nHe felt her head shaking. His heart was beating so hard he was sure she\nmust hear it.\n\n\"We were little more than children.\"\n\n\"I am not a child, and neither are you. Believe me when I say I want to\nmarry you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Simon, I do believe you!\" she cried, and she broke out in a fresh\nstorm of sobs.\n\nNow he could not help himself; he had to hold her tight. She leaned\nagainst him, and they slipped back until they were both lying down, he\non his back and she on top of him. His hand felt the small of her back.\nHow narrow her waist was!\n\nHe felt her move against him in a new way.\n\nHer arms slid around him, her hands on his neck. Her lips were on his\nagain, but this time pressing hard, ferocious, devouring. He felt her\nteeth and tongue, her breath hot in his mouth.\n\nShe was suddenly a different woman, not the shy cardinal's niece. She\nwas demanding, brimming over with a need to match his. Their hands\nhurried over each other's bodies, touching through their clothes and\nthen under their clothes. Simon had no time to be surprised at the\nchange that had come over her.\n\nShe was undoing the laces down the front of her gown, then taking his\nhands and holding them against her naked breasts. He nearly fainted with\nthe wonder of it.\n\nAnd while he held her breasts, unable to take his hands away, her hands\nmoved downward, fumbling at his clothing and at her own, her body\nsliding against him, her hand seizing his manhood, her legs opening to\nreceive him.\n\nHe groaned and squeezed his eyes shut, and she cried out with delight as\nhe entered her. She pushed herself upward, pressing her hands against\nhis shoulders, arching her back. His hands moved in gentle circles over\nher breasts, her hard nipples pressing into his palms. Her hips thrust\nagainst him furiously. He felt waves of pleasure rising to a crest in\nhis loins. His eyes came open and he saw, under the olive skin of her\nface and neck and bosom, a deep crimson flush.\n\nHer joyous scream echoed cross the lake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You shall come with me to Gobignon,\" he whispered in her ear. They lay\nwrapped in his cloak, legs entangled, clothing in disarray, the wind\nrattling the bare branches overhead. He heard his palfrey and her horse\nin the brush nearby stamping and snorting restlessly. The horses must be\nhungry.\n\n\"You shall marry me,\" he said.\n\nShe lay motionless, her head under his, resting on his arm. \"I will not.\nI cannot.\" Her tone was leaden, despairing.\n\nAfter what had just happened, how could she still refuse him? Was she\nashamed? Did she feel she had sinned?\n\n\"We are as good as married now.\"\n\n\"Oh, Simon.\" She sounded as if she were talking to a hopelessly innocent\nboy.\n\n\"There will be a new pope, and the alliance will be sealed, and my work\nwill be done,\" he said. \"I agreed to do this, and I will see it through.\nBut I do not have to be a part of the war between Count Charles and the\nking of Sicily, and neither do you. All I want is to go home and to take\nyou with me. With you beside me, my home will be all of the world that I\nwant.\"\n\nHer arms were tight around him, but she was silent. It did not matter if\nshe did not answer him. After what had just happened between them, he\nfelt as if he knew her mind as fully as he knew her body. She loved him\nand would marry him. He was sure of it.\n\nOverhead, wild geese called.\n\n\n\n\nLX\n\n\n_Why did I ever make love to him?_\n\nSophia had asked herself the same question countless times since that\nday by the wooded lake. For two months she had managed to keep away from\nSimon. Now he was here, in Ugolini's mansion.\n\nShe stood before the door of Ugolini's audience room. The servant who\nhad come to fetch her was about to open it. Sophia's hands felt coated\nwith frost. Terrified of being with Simon again, she hated herself for\nwhat she had done. To Daoud, to Simon. And to herself.\n\nThe servant opened the door. She stepped through quickly and he closed\nit behind her.\n\nAnd there was Simon de Gobignon, tall and handsome as ever, looking down\nat her reproachfully. Tension made her heart beat so hard that she\nwanted to put her hand on her chest to still it. Instead, she held her\nhand out so that Simon could bend down from his towering height and kiss\nit. She was so upset by his unexpected arrival that she did not\ncomprehend his murmured greeting.\n\nBehind Simon's back Ugolini, sitting at a large writing desk, rolled his\neyes and stretched his mouth in a grimace at her. Simon was still bent\nover her hand, so she was able to shake her head slightly in answer to\nhis unspoken question. Simon must have come here as a last resort,\nbecause after yielding to him in secret she had tried to shut him out of\nher life. She could hardly convey that to Ugolini now, even if she\nwanted to.\n\n\"The Count de Gobignon has come to call on you, my dear,\" said Ugolini,\nhis smooth voice betraying none of his anxiety. \"I have given my\npermission, provided it is also your wish.\"\n\n\"Your Signory pays me too much honor,\" she said softly to Simon. Her\nmind spun. How could she talk to Simon, when she did not understand\nherself well enough to know what lies to tell him?\n\nShe wondered what Ugolini would think of her if he knew all of what had\nhappened between her and Simon when they met that day. Would he be\nshocked? Contemptuous? Would he tell Daoud? All he knew of her meeting\nwith Simon in October was that Simon had again proposed marriage to her,\nand she had rejected him.\n\nShe said, \"I find it hard to believe that Your Signory even remembers\nme. I do not believe we have seen each other since the reception for the\nTartar ambassadors at the Palazzo Monaldeschi last year. Is that not\nso?\"\n\nAn appreciative smile replaced the somber expression on Simon's face.\nHis eyes twinkled at her. Doubtless he thought they were conspirators\ntogether.\n\n_The poor, poor boy._\n\nBut she could not see that look warming his sharp-pointed features\nwithout feeling it again--that surge of desire that had driven her to\ngive herself to him two months ago.\n\n_What is happening to me?_\n\n\"Many months have passed and much has happened, Madonna,\" he said,\n\"but--forgive me if I am too forward--I have found it impossible to\nforget you. Now that we are together in a new city, I hoped to renew\nyour acquaintance.\"\n\n\"This endless moving about will be the death of me,\" said Ugolini\nunhappily. \"Papa le Gros no sooner arrives from England and is\nofficially elected than he tells us he will be crowned in Viterbo and\nmake that the new papal seat. I have hardly had time to unpack here in\nPerugia.\"\n\n\"Your furnishings seem in good order to me, Your Eminence,\" said Simon\nwith a smile, looking around the large room with its row of large\nwindows, its thick carpeting, and its heavy black chairs and tables. A\nlarge shield carved in stone over the fireplace behind Ugolini was\npainted with five red bands on a white background.\n\n\"These are not mine,\" said Ugolini, waving a hand dismissively. \"Not my\nidea of comfortable surroundings at all. No, I simply bought this house\nand its furnishings from a Genoese merchant who was using it only part\nof the year. I would be ashamed to tell you how much I paid for it--you\nwould think me a fool. A typical Genoese, he took advantage of my need.\nAnd now I must sell all, probably to the same merchant and probably at a\nloss.\"\n\n\"That is another reason why I wanted to see you, Madonna Sophia,\" said\nSimon. \"I feared that you, like your good uncle, might find all this\nuprooting tiresome and might return to Sicily, and I would be hard put\nto find you again.\"\n\nWith an inward shudder, Sophia realized the strength of Simon's resolve\nto possess her. Only the truth would kill that determination, and she\nwould never dare to tell him that. Besides, there was a part of her\nthat, mad as it was, delighted in seeing how powerfully he was drawn to\nher.\n\n\"I am thinking of going home myself,\" said Ugolini. \"What need for me to\ngo with the new pope on this tedious search for ever-safer safety?\"\n\n\"If you returned to Sicily,\" said Simon to Sophia, \"it might be ages\nbefore I see you again.\"\n\nHis words frightened her. Was he about to ask Ugolini for her hand, and\nhow would the cardinal deal with that?\n\n\"Forgive me if I raise an unpleasant subject,\" said Ugolini, \"but if\nyour Count Charles d'Anjou accepts the pope's offer of the crown of\nsouthern Italy and Sicily, it may be a long time before any French\nnobleman will be welcome in my homeland.\"\n\nThere was no \"if\" about what Charles d'Anjou would do, Sophia thought.\nThat was just Ugolini's courtesy.\n\n\"I know, Your Eminence,\" said Simon, looking grim. \"I hope you will\nstill think of me as your friend, despite events. Just as we have been\nfriends while we disagreed over this matter of the Tartar alliance.\"\n\nUgolini clapped his hands suddenly. \"Well, it is a happy occasion when\nmy niece has such a distinguished visitor. Count, this house has a\nsecond-story loggia overlooking the atrium. It is private enough to\nshield you from prying eyes, yet not so private as to place you lovely\nyoung people in peril of temptation. Sophia will show you the way.\"\n\nBowing and thanking Ugolini, Simon followed Sophia out of the room.\n\nShe turned to Simon as soon as the door of Ugolini's audience chamber\nhad closed behind them and said, \"I need my cloak for the cold. Wait\nhere, and I will go to my room and get it.\" Without giving him a chance\nto answer, she hurried down the corridor, desperately trying to make\nsense of her thoughts and feelings.\n\nTheir lovemaking had been a terrible mistake. And yet, there had been\ntimes in those two months when the recollection of the two of them,\nwrapped in his cloak, lying on a bed of leaves, the depth of his passion\nfor her and the wildness of her answering feelings, crept up on her\nunexpectedly and sent thrills of pleasure coursing through her.\n\nAs she rummaged in her chest for a warm cloak, her eyes met those of her\nicon of Saint Simon Stylites, and she felt shame wash over her.\n\n_How can I think that I truly love Daoud, when I gave myself so freely\nto his enemy?_\n\nBut had that not been what Daoud had expected her to do all along? He\nhad always been jealous, had always made it obvious that he hated the\nidea of her letting Simon court her. And yet, from the time he first\nencountered Simon, he had made it equally obvious that he expected\nSophia to do whatever was necessary to make Simon fall in love with her.\nAnd from the moment Simon had kissed her in the Contessa di\nMonaldeschi's atrium, he had loved her, and never stopped loving her.\n\nBut to make him love her, she had pretended to be an innocent young\nSicilian woman who could be overwhelmed by her love for a French\nnobleman. Sadly enough, she felt more joy and peace of mind as that\nSicilian girl than she ever had known as a woman of Byzantium. And the\nconfusion about who she really was had become much worse after she\ndecided to keep secret from Daoud Simon's destination when he left\nOrvieto.\n\nShe felt a pounding pain inside her skull, and she pressed her hands\nagainst her bound-up hair. She shut her eyes so tight that she forced\ntears from them, and a little groan escaped her.\n\nShe was sure of one thing: If she had much more to do with Simon de\nGobignon, the confusion she felt would probably drive her mad.\n\nShe fumbled through her chest and found a rose-colored winter cloak\nlined with red squirrel fur. She threw it over her shoulders and clasped\nit around her neck, the fur collar gently brushing her chin.\n\nSimon was waiting where she had left him. He had allowed his bright blue\ncloak to fall closed around his lanky frame, so that he looked like a\npillar. She wrapped her own cloak around herself, and side by side they\nwalked to the stairs at the end of the corridor.\n\nThey said nothing to each other until they were out on the loggia under\na gray sky. A chill wind stung Sophia's cheeks. She looked down at the\nrows of fruit trees in the atrium below. Their bare branches reached up\nat her like long, slender fingers.\n\n\"I cannot understand you,\" he said. \"Why have you been so cruel to me?\"\n\nThat sounded like typical courtly lover's talk, but she knew he meant\nthe words literally. She looked at his face and saw the whiteness, the\nstrain around his mouth, the slight tremor of his lips. He looked like a\nmortally wounded man.\n\n\"I, cruel to you? Did I not beg you to stay away from my uncle? Look\nwhat you have done today. He will send me to Siracusa for certain.\"\n\nBut she felt something break inside her at the sight of his pain. She\nhad done this to him. She had hoped to give him something by letting him\npossess her one time, to make up for all that she could never give him.\nInstead, with the gift of her body she had bound him to her more tightly\nthan ever. And then, haunted by her own feelings and the memory of what\nthey had done together, she had simply tried to have nothing further to\ndo with him. And now her effort to break with him was hurting both of\nthem far more than if she had refused him that day.\n\n\"You drove me to this,\" he said, his eyes wide with anger. \"You did not\nanswer my letters or acknowledge my poems. When I tried to speak to you\nin the street and in church, you avoided me. I sent you gifts, and you\nsent them back.\"\n\nShe really would have to get out of Perugia. Back to Daoud. This would\ntear her to pieces.\n\n_But what about Rachel?_\n\nIf she left Perugia, that would be as good as abandoning Rachel. She had\nsworn to herself never to do that.\n\n_Simon guards the Tartars. He must know what has happened to Rachel.\nPerhaps he can help her._\n\nShe stopped walking and leaned against the stone railing of the loggia.\nThe leafless branches in the atrium below them rattled in the wind.\n\n\"There are many reasons that I did not want to see you. I do not know\nwhether you would understand all of them. But one is that I have heard\nsomething very ugly about those Tartars of yours.\" She had decided not\nto admit that she knew Rachel. That would take too much explaining and\ntoo many more lies, and the lies would be like hidden holes in a\nleaf-strewn path, to trip her up.\n\n\"One of the Tartars, those men you guard so carefully, kidnapped a young\ngirl from Orvieto and is holding her a prisoner now, here in Perugia at\nthe Baglioni palace. It makes me unhappy to know that you are the\nprotector of men who would do such things.\"\n\nDown below, two of Ugolini's servants brought out baskets of newly\nwashed tablecloths and bedlinens and began spreading them on the\nbranches of the trees to dry. Sophia spoke in a lower voice, giving\ndetails of the attack on Tilia's house by de Verceuil and the Tartars as\nif it were something she knew about only through hearsay, while Simon\nlooked more and more unhappy.\n\nHe frowned at her. \"I know of this girl. It is John Chagan who keeps\nher. But what is she to you? She is not even a Christian. I am surprised\nthat a woman of good family like you should worry about a prostitute.\"\n\nHow easy for a count to look down on a girl like Rachel. She felt her\nback stiffen with anger.\n\n_How he would despise me if he knew what I was._\n\n_But what am I?_\n\n\"Does it lower me in your eyes that I worry about such a girl?\"\n\nHe waved his hands placatingly. \"No, no. Such charitable feelings do you\ncredit. I _would_ like to help her, and I know Friar Mathieu has already\ntried. I just wondered how _you_ came to know and care about this girl's\ncase.\" He looked earnestly into her eyes. His eyes were a blue as clear\nand bright as that lake where they had lain together.\n\n\"The story is talked about by all the servants and common folk of the\ntown. I feel very sorry for her. She is just a child. I find myself\nimagining how she feels--kidnapped, helpless, raped by this barbarian, a\nprisoner. Have you not seen her yourself?\"\n\nSimon nodded reluctantly, looking away. \"Yes, glimpses. She stays in her\nroom.\"\n\n\"She is forced to stay in her room.\" Sophia sensed that Simon knew more\nthan he admitted about what the Tartar had done to Rachel and was\nashamed to be connected with it.\n\n\"What has this to do with you and me?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You are close to the Tartars. You might be able to help her.\"\n\nSimon glowered. \"If I had been there that day in Orvieto, you may be\nsure they would not have raided that brothel.\"\n\nHe might be on the enemy side, she thought, but he was not a savage like\nthe Franks of her childhood. He was a genuinely good man, and that was\nwhat made the hopeless dream of marrying him so painful.\n\nShe put her hand on his arm and squeezed. \"Will you try to get the\nTartar to release the girl? Cardinal Ugolini will take her in.\"\n\nWhen she laid her hand on the hard, wiry muscle in his arm, she did not\nwant to let go.\n\n_I still want him! My God, what is the matter with me?_\n\n\"De Verceuil would oppose me if I tried to take the girl away from John.\nIncredible, is it not? A cardinal involved in kidnapping a young girl\nfor the pleasure of a barbarian?\"\n\nSophia, taught by her Greek Orthodox priests that the Roman Church was a\nfountainhead of wickedness, did not think the cardinal's actions all\nthat incredible. Besides, was she not in league with another cardinal\nwho was helping the Muslims?\n\n\"There _must_ be a way to help Rachel,\" she said.\n\nHe brought his face close to hers. \"Sophia, I will speak to Friar\nMathieu. But, as I said, he has already tried to persuade John to let\nthe girl go free. With no success. And I am sure there is nothing more\nFriar Mathieu can do before tomorrow, when I leave Perugia.\"\n\nShe loved that serious, intent look. It was as if light were coming from\nhis eyes.\n\nBut what he had just said took her by surprise.\n\n\"Leave Perugia? Where are you going?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"No one is supposed to know.\"\n\n\"Simon!\" She put anger into her voice, knowing he was vulnerable. If she\ncould get some information of use to Daoud from him, she would have an\nexcuse for having let Simon make love to her. And with Daoud far away in\nManfred's kingdom, there was no chance this time that he could hurt\nSimon.\n\nHe touched her cheek with the tips of his long fingers, and she could\nfeel him struggling with himself.\n\n\"Swear you will tell no one.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n_He really thinks I can be depended upon to keep an oath._\n\n\"All right. I had a message from Count Charles--he who gave me this task\nof guarding the Tartars. He calls me to meet him at Ostia. That is why I\ncame here today, even though I knew you would not want me to. Knowing I\nwould be leaving here and might not see you for months made me\ndesperate.\"\n\nCharles d'Anjou at Ostia--the seaport of Rome!\n\nAs she realized what Simon's words meant, terror raced through Sophia.\nShe was going to fall from the loggia and break into a thousand pieces,\nlike an icicle.\n\nAnjou was going to take Rome and cut Italy in half. Instead of trying to\ncross the Alps and then fight his way through the Ghibellino cities of\nnorthern Italy, Charles must have come by sea. Now he would be able to\nstrike directly at the heart of Manfred's kingdom.\n\n_What will Daoud do? What will happen to Manfred? If only we had Tilia\nhere, with her carrier pigeons._\n\nDespite her fur-lined cloak, a chill seized her.\n\nShe had feared for Daoud, that he might have to fight a great French\narmy. And though she had long since ceased to love Manfred, she had\nfeared for him and his kingdom. But the thought of the many obstacles\nbetween France and southern Italy had comforted her. Now, knowing that\nCharles d'Anjou was so close to Manfred's kingdom, she felt herself\nactually trembling.\n\nHe put his hand on hers. \"You're frightened.\"\n\nStaring down at the bare trees, she whispered, \"Yes, for my people.\"\n\nHis hand gripped hers tightly. He bent down so that he was speaking\nsoftly into her ear.\n\n\"I know you cannot forget your people, but you could escape this war. My\nservice is done, now that the new pope has confirmed the alliance with\nthe Tartars. I do not have to stay in Italy.\"\n\nShe was glad he did not want to fight for Charles. The thought of him\nand Daoud meeting on a battlefield was horrible. But surely this brother\nof King Louis would make every effort to draw Simon into the war.\n\n\"Count Charles will want you to fight.\"\n\n\"If you will marry me and come to Gobignon, nothing else will matter to\nme. We will live content in my castle in the heart of my domain. We will\nshut out the world and its wars.\"\n\nShe turned to look at him, and the longing on his face was painful to\nsee.\n\nShe felt the tears coming, hot, blurring her vision.\n\n\"Simon, I cannot!\"\n\nHis grip on her hand was painful. \"Again and again you say that to me.\nAnd you never tell me _why_. Are you secretly a nun? Have you taken\nvows? Does your husband still live? I demand that you tell me! Stop\ntormenting me like this.\" His usually pale face was suddenly scarlet\nwith rage.\n\nHis anger dried up her tears.\n\n_I know how I can put an end to this._\n\n\"I will, Simon. But I am not ready to speak of it today.\"\n\n\"Then _when_?\"\n\n\"Go now and meet your Count Charles at Ostia. By the time you come back\nto the papal court we will probably have moved to Viterbo. And when I\nsee you again, I will tell you why I cannot marry you.\"\n\nThe shadow cleared from his face. \"Do you promise with all your heart?\nAnd if I can persuade you that your reason is not good enough, then will\nyou marry me?\"\n\nFor a moment she hesitated. Even though her life depended on deceiving\nhim, she could not bear to make such a promise. But then she saw that\nshe could honestly agree to what he asked.\n\n\"If you still want me to marry you--yes.\"\n\n_I can say that because if you ever come to know my true reason for not\nmarrying you, you will hate me more than you have ever hated anyone in\nyour life._\n\nHe left her soon afterward. She went back to her room and cried for most\nof the afternoon. Every so often she looked up to see the icon of the\ndesert saint staring at her. She saw the same reproach in Simon\nStylites's eyes that she had seen in Simon de Gobignon's.\n\n\n\n\nLXI\n\n\nThough the day was cold and damp, the sky an ugly, unwelcoming gray,\nSimon's first view of Rome brought tears to his eyes. He came out of a\nsmall grove of cypresses on the east bank of the Tiber to see gray\nwalls, punctuated by square towers, spread wide before him. Beyond the\nwalls, out of a haze of dust and wood smoke, above masses of peaked\nroofs, crenellated palace towers rose lordly, vying for ascendancy with\nthe bell towers of churches. Marble buildings adorned with white columns\ncrowned the hills.\n\nThe swift-moving brown river on his left bent around the walls and\ndisappeared beyond them.\n\nEven though he did not want to be part of Charles d'Anjou's invasion of\nItaly, the thrill of seeing Rome for the first time made up for his\ndistress.\n\nRome was by no means as beautiful a sight as Orvieto, but it awed him to\nthink that this city had ruled the world when Jesus walked the earth.\nWhat must it have been like to be a Roman legionary, returning to this\nplace from a victory in some far-off land? This dirt track would have\nbeen a well-paved road then. Looking off to his right, he saw fragments\nof wall bounding the edge of a field, and a broken, fluted column rising\namong olive trees, quiet reminders that the city had once extended into\nthese fields and beyond.\n\nSimon was mounted on a borrowed war-horse, a mare whose shiny coat\nreminded him of Sophia's hair--a brown so dark it might be taken for\nblack. After many hours of riding, the mare's rocking pace had chafed\nthe insides of his mail-clad legs.\n\nHe rode a few yards behind Count Charles d'Anjou and the three knights\nCharles had appointed marshals of his army. When he looked back over his\nshoulder, he saw a column of mailed knights riding three abreast strung\nout along the Tiber for nearly half a mile, and beyond them, almost\nobscured by clouds of yellow dust, clinking files of men-at-arms,\ncrossbows and spears over their shoulders.\n\nUnimpressed by the sight of Rome, Anjou and his commanders carried on an\nargument.\n\n\"You are a hard taskmaster, Monseigneur,\" said Gautier du Mont, whose\nbronze hair was cropped in the shape of a bowl, slightly tilted so that\nthe back was lower than the front. \"To make your knights ride half a day\nin full armor when they have not seen a denier from your coffers since\nwe sailed from Marseilles--you demand too much.\" The points of du Mont's\nmustache hung below his chin. Simon had heard he was little better than\na routier, a highwayman, who had begun his knightly career by robbing\ntravelers who passed his castle in the Pyrenees.\n\nWhat Simon had seen thus far of Charles's army made the enterprise look\ndecidedly unsavory. Before reaching Ostia, Simon had expected that the\nmen Charles commanded would be vassals, men who had received land from\nhim and were bound by ancient oaths. He quickly realized that all of\nthese men were adventurers with little or no holdings of their own, in\nthis enterprise with Charles for whatever they could gain. Charles could\ncommand them only as long as they could hope to grow rich in his\nservice.\n\nSimon supposed this was the best Charles could do, since King Louis had\nrefused to help him raise knights and men and insisted that he hire them\nhimself. Knights willing to go to war for hire could not be expected to\nbe the better sort. Not only did Simon not want to make war on the\nItalians, he wanted even less to be associated with men like the ones\nCharles had recruited.\n\nUnlike his three marshals, who were all bareheaded, Charles wore a\nhelmet. A steel replica of his count's coronet ringed its pointed top.\nBeside him rode an equerry with his personal standard, the black\nsilhouette of a lion rearing up on its hind legs against a flame-red\nbackground. Charles turned so that his big Capetian nose was outlined\nagainst the iron-gray sky.\n\n\"You complain, du Mont, because I ordered our knights to wear full\narmor?\" said Charles. \"I did it for their own protection. I expect to\nmeet resistance.\"\n\n_Only eight hundred knights and two thousand men-at-arms_, Simon\nthought. _Hardly enough to take Rome, if the Romans do decide to fight.\nNowhere near enough to beat Manfred._\n\nHe had been shocked when he arrived at Ostia last night and found out\nhow small Charles's invasion force was. Being a part of this war was\ngoing to be downright dangerous.\n\n\"Time enough for us to don armor when the resistance appears,\" said\nAlistair FitzTrinian, a knight from England whose face was a mass of\nsmallpox scars. Simon had so far been unable to look at the man without\nhaving to freeze the muscles of his face to keep from wincing.\n\nCount Charles sighed, and held out his arm in the direction of Rome.\n\"Look there, gentlemen,\" he said in a patient tone, as if instructing\nschoolchildren. \"The Romans are not waiting for us to put on our armor.\"\n\nSimon followed his pointing finger and saw a gray mass spreading out\ninto the field near one of the city's gates, flowing around cottages and\ngroves of trees. It appeared to be a great crowd of several thousand\ncitizens. Fully alert now, Simon heard a dull roar, like the hum of a\nswarm of bees, that sounded decidedly hostile. He felt a twinge of fear.\n\n\"Get your helmets on, the three of you,\" Charles snapped. \"Set an\nexample for the rest, or may the devil carry you away!\"\n\nThe three commanders slowly and sullenly pulled on their helmets, which\nhad been hanging down their backs from straps under their chins. The\nmanner of the three marshals toward Count Charles shocked Simon. If\nthese were the leaders, what In God's name could the rank and file be\nlike?\n\n_Any one of my Venetian archers or the Tartars' Armenian guards would be\nworth a dozen of these._\n\nAs the army of Anjou, with Charles and Simon and the three marshals in\nthe lead, advanced slowly, Simon noticed that six or so men, several\nhundred paces in front of the shouting citizens, were walking to meet\nthem.\n\nIn a short time the small delegation stood before Count Charles,\nblocking his path.\n\nCharles raised his arm, and the knights behind him shouted the order to\nhalt down the line. How would Count Charles deal with the\nrepresentatives of an unfriendly populace, Simon wondered. This should\nbe interesting. He might learn something.\n\nThe count turned to Dietrich von Regensburg, his third commander. \"I\nwant a troop of the Burgundian pikemen up here now. Surround these\nfellows.\" Von Regensburg, a knight with hard blue eyes, a flattened\nnose, and a huge jaw, saluted and swung his dun horse around to ride\nback to the long line of men-at-arms following Charles and his knights.\n\nAnjou's order made Simon uneasy. Why try to frighten these Romans? Would\nit not be better if he could enter the city with their approval?\n\nThen he beckoned Simon to bring his horse up beside him. \"No doubt you\nspeak Italian better than any of us. Translate for me.\" He glowered down\nhis long nose at the Romans who had approached him. \"I am Count Charles\nd'Anjou. I have come here as protector of the city of Rome, at the\nrequest of His Holiness, the pope.\"\n\nSimon repeated this.\n\n\"Rome needs protection only from you!\" one of the men shouted.\n\n\"There is no pope,\" another called out. \"The old one is dead and the new\none has not been crowned.\"\n\nSimon could hardly believe his ears. He had heard that Roman citizens\nwere unruly; that was why the pope had moved away from Rome. But the way\nthese men addressed the Count of Anjou, the brother of the king of\nFrance--it was unthinkable. It was madness. The count might not\nunderstand their words, but the disrespectful tone was unmistakable.\n\nHesitantly, he translated. Charles stared at the six Romans, his swarthy\nface expressionless.\n\nCharles's great black and white war-horse shifted his legs restlessly,\nand Charles stilled him with a jerk of the reins. Even the horse sensed\nthe Romans' anger.\n\n\"Silencio!\" ordered a Roman somewhat taller than the others, with a\nshock of iron-gray hair and an angular jaw. He wore a mantle of deep\nmaroon velvet trimmed with white fur, and a longsword hung from his\njeweled belt. He bowed courteously to Count Charles and Simon.\n\n\"Your Signory, I am Leone Pedulla, secretary of the Senate of Rome. We\ncome, with all respect, to pray you to turn back. The city of Rome rules\nherself. We are most distressed to see a foreign army, a French army,\napproaching our walls. If you wish to visit us and confer with our\nleading citizens, leave this army behind. Come to us as a guest,\nbringing a few of your barons with you. We will then offer you our\nhospitality. We ask you to leave us in peace.\"\n\nSimon wished himself far away as he translated for Anjou. These Romans\ndid not know Count Charles.\n\nAs Simon was conveying Leone Pedulla's speech, a line of big, bearded\nfoot soldiers carrying spears taller than a man, wearing leather\ncuirasses and wide-brimmed helmets of polished steel, marched forward,\nboots crunching on the stubble of the harvested field. At von\nRegensburg's command, the pikemen formed a ring around the Roman\ndelegation. The Romans' eyes darted anxiously from side to side.\n\nCharles said, \"Simon, tell this impertinent fellow who calls himself\nsecretary of the Senate just this: I order him to clear away that rabble\nblocking the city gates.\"\n\nSimon repeated the count's command in Italian. His heart began to beat\nmore rapidly as he sensed an evil moment coming closer and closer.\n\n\"The people standing before the walls are citizens of Rome, Your\nSignory, acting legally to protect the city from what seems to us a\nforeign invader,\" Pedulla answered. \"I cannot tell them to go away.\"\n\nSimon wished he could soften this when he translated it. Charles's mouth\ndrew down in a harsh, inverted V.\n\n\"Very well.\" He turned to von Regensburg and pointed. \"I would prefer to\nhang them, but it would take too long. Use your spears on them.\"\n\n_Dear, merciful God, do not let this happen!_ Simon prayed.\n\n\"No!\" Pedulla cried, his voice shrill with horror as the German knight\nshouted a command and the Burgundians leveled their spears. It was the\ngray-haired Roman's last word. His hand had not quite reached the hilt\nof his sword when a bearlike foot soldier lunged at him, driving a spear\nthrough his embroidered tunic into his chest. The pikeman thrust the\nsteel point in low enough to miss the breastbone but high enough to\npierce the heart. Pedulla did not even have time enough to finish his\nscream.\n\n\"Clemenza, per favore!\" cried another Roman who a moment ago had been\nshouting defiance. A spear point caught him in the throat.\n\nSimon wished he could turn his eyes away, but he did not want Charles\nand his marshals to think him squeamish. His heart thundered and his\nstomach churned, and he feared that his body would betray him. The other\npikemen moved in quickly, taking long steps as if performing spear\ndrill, holding their pikes near the points for close work. A moment\nlater they stepped back from a heap of sprawled, dead bodies.\n\n_God! How little time it takes to kill a man!_\n\nNow Simon did look away. The blood, the staring, dead faces, the twisted\narms and legs, were too pitiful a sight to bear.\n\nSimon remembered de Verceuil's ordering the archers to shoot into the\ncrowd at Orvieto. This was worse. These men had been discourteous,\nperhaps, but they were officials of the city, on an embassy. And Count\nCharles had ordered them killed as calmly as he might order his army to\nbreak camp.\n\nThis was the man whose wishes had governed Simon's life for over a year.\nSimon felt his bond to Charles as a terrible chain and he longed to be\nfree.\n\n_This is a taste of what will happen to Sophia's people if Charles\nconquers Manfred. If only she will let me take her to Gobignon, so she\nwill not have to see such things._\n\nCount Charles raised a hand encased in a gleaming mail glove. \"Forward.\"\n\n\"One moment, Monseigneur,\" said Gautier du Mont, his sharp voice cutting\nthrough the sounds of the army resuming its march.\n\nCharles turned to him impatiently. \"What now, du Mont?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, we have just killed the emissaries of the Romans. I fear\nwe will now have to fight that mob. Look. They are coming at us.\"\n\nSimon looked over toward the city. The mass that had emerged from the\ncity, a long line of people stretching eastward from the Tiber to a\ndistant forest, was moving through the fields and olive groves. To\nSimon's eye they appeared to vastly outnumber Charles's army. Simon\ncould see swords gleaming and spears waving. They formed no ranks and\nfiles as a professional army would, but they came on inexorably like the\nwaves of the sea, and their shouts were angry.\n\nSimon felt cold fear sweep away the sick pity he had felt for the\nexecuted Roman delegation. That huge mob was a formidable sight.\n\n\"Of course we will fight them, du Mont,\" Charles answered, his voice\nrising. \"One charge and we will scatter them to the winds.\"\n\nTrue, thought Simon. Crowds of villeins or peasants were no match for\ndisciplined fighting men. But just how disciplined was the force behind\nCharles?\n\n\"I think, Monseigneur,\" said du Mont, \"that before we do any fighting,\nit is appropriate to discuss the terms of our payment.\"\n\n_Oh, by God's white beard!_ Simon swore to himself. They were about to\nbe attacked by five or more times their number, and these bastards were\narguing about money. They ought to be stripped of their knighthoods.\n\n\"I have told you my gold shipment was late getting from Marseilles to\nOstia,\" said Charles in a placating tone. \"You will be paid. Tonight,\ntomorrow, or the next day it will catch up to us.\"\n\n\"Then tonight, tomorrow, or the next day, Monseigneur,\" said the\npock-marked FitzTrinian, \"you can command us to charge that rabble.\"\n\nThe Roman mob was close enough now for Simon to make out what they were\nshouting.\n\n\"Muorire alla Francia!\" _Death to the French!_\n\nThe cry sent a bolt of fear through Simon. They would have to do\nsomething at once.\n\nWere Charles's lieutenants actually going to sit on their motionless\nhorses and haggle with him until these infuriated Romans fell upon them?\nNot just Charles's venture was at stake, but their own lives. Could they\nbe stupid--or greedy--enough to let themselves be overwhelmed while they\nargued about money?\n\n_Yes, they could be. That stupid and that greedy._\n\nSimon's fear transmuted itself to anger. These men were a disgrace to\nchivalry. Worse, as marshals of an army commanded by King Louis's\nbrother, they dishonored France. He almost wanted to draw his sword\nagainst them, his disgust was so great.\n\n\"You speak of dishonor when you are refusing to attack an enemy in the\nfield at the order of your seigneur?\" Charles shouted.\n\n\"We are not refusing, Monseigneur--\" Alistair FitzTrinian began.\n\nSimon had heard enough. If Charles's hired commanders would not command,\nhe would.\n\n\"Follow me, Thierry.\" Simon swung his horse around to ride toward the\nrear of the column. His face was hot with anger.\n\nSimon felt little sympathy for Charles; he had chosen these men. But\nSimon de Gobignon, at least, was not going to let himself be set upon\nand murdered by a crowd of commoners, even if those commoners had ample\njustification. Nor was he going to allow French arms--if these\nblackguards Charles d'Anjou had hired could be said to represent French\narms--to be disgraced. He had learned somewhat about leading fighting\nmen in the last year. He could do what was needful, since no one else\nseemed about to.\n\nHe galloped past the files of mounted knights who crowded the road\nbeside the Tiber. Beyond them were the foot soldiers. If those\nBurgundians who executed the Roman delegation were any example, the\nmen-at-arms might be more reliable than the knights. Simon searched the\ncolumn for the sort of men he needed.\n\nHe saw, just past the end of the line of mounted men, two score or more\nof archers in blue tunics with longbows slung over their backs. He was\nnot experienced with the use of the longbow in battle, but what he had\nheard about its long range suggested that it might be very useful just\nnow.\n\n\"Suivez-moi!\" he shouted. The archers stared at him and drew themselves\nup straighter, but looked puzzled. Of course, Simon thought. The longbow\nwas a weapon favored by the English. He beckoned with his hand, and the\nEnglishmen ran to him. Good.\n\n\"My lord, I speak un peu Fran\u00e7ais,\" said one of them, whose crested\nhelmet marked him as a sergeant. \"If you give your orders to me, very\nslowly--\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Simon, pleased with the man's readiness to cooperate. He\nexplained what he wanted.\n\n\"Suivez-moi,\" Simon called again to the longbowmen, and their sergeant\nrepeated, \"Follow me,\" in English. He trotted off, keeping the dark\nbrown mare to a pace that would allow running men to follow him.\n\nWhen they came to Charles and his three mutinous lieutenants, still\narguing, the Roman mob had advanced close enough for Simon to be able to\nmake out individuals. They were almost all men, as far as he could see,\nwith a shouting, fist-shaking woman here and there, and mostly dressed\nin the plain browns and grays, whites and blacks, of common folk. Men\nwith swords and spears made up the forefront. A few men on horseback\nwith lances and banners rode on the flanks of the mob. Someone was\ncarrying a red and white banner, a design of keys and towers.\n\nFor a moment Simon hesitated. He did not want to kill these people.\n\nBut there was no way of stopping the Romans, and no one else was able or\nwilling to act. If he did nothing, Charles's army would be destroyed and\nSimon would probably be killed along with everyone else.\n\nHe remembered something Roland, his true father, had told him many years\nago: _No one who wants to live through a battle can afford to feel sorry\nfor the men he is trying to kill. Make sure you kill them first, and\nthen you can mourn for them afterward._\n\nPutting his sympathy for the Romans out of his mind, Simon began to give\norders to his archers. He deployed them in a line stretching from the\nTiber to a thick grove of trees to the east. Through their sergeant he\ntold them to shoot at the front and center of the oncoming Romans. He\nnoticed that the voices of Count Charles and his antagonists had fallen\nsilent.\n\n_They are watching me_, he thought, and hoped no one would try to stop\nhim.\n\nWhen the Englishmen had their arrows nocked and their bows drawn and\naimed, Simon shouted, \"Tirez!\"\n\nThey understood that well enough.\n\nThe arrows flew in flat curves across the narrowing distance between\nCount Charles's army and the Roman citizens. Simon saw men falling and\nothers tripping over them.\n\n\"Encore!\" Simon cried, but then looking back at his little troop of\narchers saw to his surprise that the Englishmen had already loaded and\nfired a second time. He had not known that the longbow could be fired\nagain and again so quickly, much more quickly than the crossbow. Screams\nof panic and pain arose from the mob before him.\n\n_I am killing poor people who are trying to defend their city._\n\nA pang of shame swept through him, and he hesitated before giving the\nnext order. But he remembered Roland's advice. The longer it took to\ndrive these Romans back inside their gates, the more blood would be\nshed, and the more likely that lives would be lost on his side.\n\n\"Fire into the midst of the crowd,\" he told the English sergeant.\n\nThe arrows arced high into the overcast sky and fell like dark streaks\nof rain. The Romans were milling about, some trying to help the wounded,\nsome running away, some shouting orders or pleas, trying to control the\nconfusion.\n\nSimon rode out in front of the bowmen.\n\n\"Advance and keep firing,\" he called to the sergeant. \"Keep it up, keep\npushing them back.\"\n\nHe heard an arrow whistle past him. So the Romans also had some archers\namong them. He was too excited to feel any fear.\n\nThe longbowmen marched out into the field, stopping at intervals to load\nand fire, then advancing again. They hardly had to aim. Anywhere the\narrows fell in the mob, packed closer together in retreat, they would\nwound or kill. Simon heard shouts and screams of terror from across the\nfield. The Romans were falling over one another, trying to get away.\nNone of the poor devils was wearing armor.\n\nWhere were the professional defenders of the city, Simon wondered.\n\nThe great crowd was falling back toward the city's gates. Like the\ndebris left by a wave receding from shore, bodies, dark clumps, lay\nthick in the stubble of the harvested fields. Simon saw a man throw his\narms around the trunk of an olive tree and slowly slide to the ground.\nHe saw the red and white banner fall, then someone pick it up and run\nwith it. Three men lay draped over low stone walls, arms and legs\ntwitching.\n\nThe farmers' fields between Count Charles's army and the walls of Rome\nwere littered with the dead, the dying, and the struggling wounded.\nSimon wanted to call back the archers. He felt as if he had loosed a\ngreat rock from the top of a hill and it was rolling downward,\nunstoppable, destroying everything in its path.\n\nThe Romans were running desperately, and the pity he had forced himself\nnot to feel while he was fighting them rose up to overwhelm him. His\nheart lodged in his throat like a rock, and tears crept out of the\ncorners of his eyes.\n\n_In God's name, what have I done?_\n\n\"Magnificent, Simon! You did admirably.\"\n\nCharles d'Anjou had ridden up beside him and was grinning out at the\ncarnage in the fields of stubble. His dark eyes were alight with\npleasure. He struck Simon on his mailed back, one of those hard blows he\nwas fond of.\n\n\"What presence of mind! What initiative!\" He lowered his voice. \"You\ncould not have done better if we had planned it ahead of time. You saved\nme a fortune in gold.\"\n\nHe spurred his black and white charger closer to Simon's mare and leaned\nover to kiss him emphatically on the cheek, his stubble scratching\nSimon's face.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Simon.\n\nCharles drew back and looked at him with narrowed eyes. \"You don't?\nWell, you did the right thing. We'll talk about it later.\"\n\nHe turned and shouted at his three commanders. \"You see, idiots! One\nFrench knight with his head on his shoulders can do what all of you and\nall your knights could not.\"\n\n\"We were not attempting to do anything,\" du Mont said sourly, pushing\nhis helmet back off his bowl-shaped hair.\n\n\"Those were the bowmen I brought from Lincoln you used, Monseigneur de\nGobignon,\" said FitzTrinian. \"You did not have my permission.\"\n\nIn his present mood, Simon wished the pock-marked knight would make an\nissue of it.\n\n\"Do not make yourself more ridiculous than you already are, Sire\nAlistair,\" said Charles.\n\n\"We still have not settled this question of pay,\" said Dietrich of\nRegensburg.\n\n\"Go pick the purses of those dead men out there,\" said Charles with a\nscornful laugh.\n\nAgain Simon was sickened by Charles's manner. He had expected that the\ncount would punish his rebellious commanders. Hanging would be an\nexcellent idea. Flog them out of the army, at least. Instead, he\ncontinued to argue with them, even banter with them, as if they were\nall a pack of merchants in a money changer's shop.\n\nTo get away from the wretched business, Simon kicked his dark brown mare\ninto motion and, followed by Thierry, rode out toward the city. He\nwished desperately that he were back in Perugia with Sophia.\n\nHe had seen enough killing in Orvieto, especially the night of the\nattack on the Palazzo Monaldeschi, to harden him. Still, it made his\nheart feel heavy as stone in his chest to see so many lives cut short.\nAnd by his command.\n\nWhat pain it must be to die. To have your life stopped, forever.\n\nHe recalled the arrow that had whizzed past him. He could easily have\nbeen killed.\n\nHe rode toward the walls of Rome until they towered over him. The crowd\nof citizens who had come out to stop Count Charles was gone--those able\nto flee. There were only the dead and dying scattered in the stubble\nfield around him. Simon tried to avoid looking at the wounded. If it had\nbeen one or two men, as it had been that day at Orvieto when de Verceuil\nordered the crossbowmen to fire into the crowd, he would have tried to\nhelp them. But there were too many here.\n\nHis contingent of English archers marched past him on their way back to\nthe main army, their work done. They gave him a cheer, and he, in spite\nof his heavy heart, did as a good leader should and smiled and waved.\n\n\"Good work, my friends! Well done.\"\n\nHe looked ahead again, and saw that the nearest gate, the one through\nwhich most of the retreating citizens had run, hung open. He pulled his\nhorse to a stop.\n\n_I am not going to be the first of these invaders to enter Rome. I have\nno right to be here._\n\nFive horsemen appeared suddenly in the gateway. More resistance?\n\nThese men were richly dressed, their scarlet capes billowing as they\nrode toward him. Their hands were empty of weapons.\n\nThe rider in the lead was a man with a glossy black beard and a sharply\nhooked nose. He reminded Simon a little of the Contessa di Monaldeschi.\n\n\"I am Duke Gaetano Orsini,\" said the bearded man. \"These gentlemen\nrepresent the families of Colonna, Frangipani, Papareschi, and Caetani.\nWe have come to greet Count Charles, and to welcome him to Rome.\" These\nmen, Simon thought, must come from some of the families whose fortified\ntowers loomed over the city.\n\nTheir sudden appearance made Simon angry. It was all happening backward.\nThey should have come out first and made peace with Count Charles, and\nthen there would have been no need for all this butchery.\n\nSimon identified himself. \"I will take you to Count Charles.\" The Roman\nnobles doffed their velvet caps to Simon, and he touched the brim of his\nhelmet.\n\nAs their horses trotted across the field, Simon observed Orsini's gaze\ntraveling coldly over the bodies of the fallen Romans. Some of them,\nstill alive, called out to him pleadingly. He ignored them.\n\nSimon could not resist saying, \"If you had come out to welcome Count\nCharles before these others did, much bloodshed might have been\nprevented.\"\n\nOrsini shrugged. \"Necessary bloodshed. The mob that threatened Count\nCharles was incited by the Ghibellino faction in Rome. They tried to get\nthe city militia to join them, but we held the professionals back.\nIndeed, we have heard you killed one of the leaders of the popolo\nminuto, the lower orders, Leone Pedulla. That was well done. His loss\nwill be a blessing to this city, as will the loss of these other\ntroublemakers.\"\n\nSimon felt as disgusted with this man as he had with Charles's marshals.\nUnable to keep order in their own city, the nobility of Rome approved\nthe slaughter of their people by foreign invaders. It was despicable.\nCount Charles would have to deal with them, but he himself would speak\nno more to these poltroons who called themselves gentlemen.\n\nThey rode in silence toward the advancing Angevin army of Count Charles.\nThe count's black and red lion banner fluttered over his steel coronet.\nHe was riding toward Rome again with his commanders behind him as if all\ntheir differences were settled.\n\nCharles and his leaders reined up before the new delegation from Rome.\nThe Count of Anjou greeted these representatives of the great families\nof Rome with courtesy, dismounting and embracing Gaetano Orsini. He\nassured each Roman nobleman, Simon interpreting, how happy he was to see\nhim.\n\n\"I believe it would be best if my men and I were to camp outside the\ncity walls for tonight,\" he said, looking down his large nose at Orsini.\n\n\"I was just about to suggest that,\" said Orsini. \"The city is quite\ncrowded.\"\n\n\"Perhaps less crowded now.\" Charles laughed, with a nod at the fields\nwhere wailing men and women were walking, trying to find their dead and\nbear them away for burial. \"At any rate, I will enter the city\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"All will be prepared for Your Signory. The loyal supporters of the\nParte Guelfo are eager to greet you. You will be made an honorary\npatrician. There will be banners, cheering crowds, music. The militia\nwill parade for you. It will be a true Roman triumph.\" Orsini was all\nsmiles and flourishes.\n\nCharles smiled. \"A triumph. Yes, and I assume that a triumph will\ninclude tribute?\"\n\nOrsini's smile faded. \"Tribute?\"\n\nCharles nodded slowly. \"To be exact, I will require three thousand\nflorins to be delivered to me tomorrow morning before I enter the city,\nto compensate my men, whose pay is in arrears. I will have further\nrequirements, but I will not press you for all at once. Three thousand\nflorins will be enough for tomorrow.\"\n\nSimon saw von Regensburg and FitzTrinian grinning at each other.\n\nOrsini's mouth worked several times after Simon translated Charles's\ndemand for three thousand florins. \"But, Your Signory, we welcome you as\nour protector, not as one who comes to--to take from us.\"\n\nCharles laughed and threw his arms wide. \"Protectors cost money, my dear\nOrsini. I am sure the great city of Rome can scrape together three\nthousand florins by tomorrow. It will not be necessary for me to send my\narmy into the city to help you find the money, will it?\"\n\n\"Not at all necessary, Your Signory,\" said Orsini, bowing, his face\nflushed to the roots of his black beard.\n\nThese Guelfo nobles apparently had thought that the count of Anjou had\ncome to Rome purely out of some high-minded desire to serve the pope and\nthe Church, Simon thought. They were starting to learn what Simon\nhimself had gradually come to realize: that Count Charles did nothing\nthat did not first and foremost benefit himself.\n\nAs for himself, Simon's deepest wish was to get away from all this\nslaughter and pillage and dishonor, and the sooner the better.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Rome is an old whore who lies down for every strong man who comes\nalong,\" said Count Charles. \"All we needed was to show our resolution\nwhen that mob came at us, and Rome fell over backward.\"\n\nThe two men sat across from each other at a small camp table in\nCharles's tent, sharing wine and succulent roast pork killed and cooked\nby Anjou's equerries. Simon stared into the flames of a six-branched\ncandlestick standing on Charles's armor chest at the side of the tent,\nand thought that he would far rather be exploring the wonders of Rome he\nhad heard so much about--the Colosseum, the Lateran Palace, the Forum,\nthe catacombs.\n\nSimon remembered his mother's warning of years ago: _Charles d'Anjou\nuses people._ How often, with Charles, had he suspected, feared, that\nshe was right? But those boyhood years in Charles's household, Simon's\nweapons training under Charles, his feeling that King Louis was a sort\nof father to him and Count Charles a sort of uncle, all made him want to\ntrust Charles. But it was becoming impossible to do that, especially\nsince Avignon, when Charles asked him to betray the king's confidence.\nEven now, though he wished they could get back on their old footing, he\nfound himself wondering whether that old footing had been an illusion.\nPerhaps all along Charles had been kind to him only the better to use\nhim.\n\nHe was terribly afraid that he knew what Charles wanted to talk to him\nabout tonight. He had seen the sorry quality of Charles's army, and he\nhad been impelled, almost against his will, to take the lead when the\nRoman mob was attacking. If Simon were in Charles's position, he knew\nwhat he would want.\n\n\"You did just the right thing today, Simon,\" Charles said. \"Those three\ncutthroats would never have let themselves be overrun, nor would I. But\nI hadn't paid them in a while, no fault of mine, and they saw that as an\nexcuse to try to extract a promise from me of an additional monthly five\nflorins per knight and increases for the common soldiers as well. They\nthought the sight of that mob would force me to yield to them.\"\n\n_So their refusal to act was a pretense_, Simon thought. But he began to\nfeel disgusted with himself. Of all of them, he was the only one who had\nbeen duped.\n\nCharles went on. \"They were testing my courage. They did not know me\nwell. They know me better now. I would have stood my ground until they\nwere forced to turn and defend themselves. But you settled things by\ntaking those archers out into the field and driving the rabble off. And\na good thing you did, because the situation _was_ risky. They might have\nwaited too long to attack, and we might have lost lives unnecessarily.\nIt was a dangerous game they were playing.\"\n\n_And a dangerous game you were playing_, Simon thought. He leaned\nforward, resting his elbows on the table. Charles had used him, just as\nMother had warned, and he felt angry enough to speak frankly.\n\n\"It was mutiny. In my opinion you should have hanged those men. They are\nlittle better than routiers. But all you did was haggle with them.\"\n\nSipping from his goblet, Charles lounged back on his cot and laughed.\n\"Ah, Simon, I forget sometimes that you have never been in a war. This\nis the way it always is. Especially at the beginning. These men--du\nMont, FitzTrinian, von Regensburg, and their followers--are hirelings,\nand when one goes shopping for an army, one buys, not the best there is,\nbut only the best that is on the market.\"\n\nSimon wanted to lean back as Charles had done, but there was no back to\nthe stool he sat on. Charles's furnishings were as meager as everything\nelse about his army.\n\n\"I fear for you, uncle, I really do. Not only are your knights\nundisciplined, but you are so few in number.\" He instantly regretted\nsaying that. It would give Charles an opening to ask him for help.\n\nCharles smiled complacently. \"And you think Manfred von Hohenstaufen,\nwith his host of Saracens and Sicilians, will march up here and chew me\nup, is that it?\"\n\n\"Well--perhaps.\"\n\nCharles swirled his wine cup and drank from it. \"A bigger army would\nhave cost me far more to ship and far more to pay, feed, and quarter\nwhile I am here. I needed this much of an army to establish myself in\nRome. I do not need more until I actually make war on Manfred, and that\nmay be as much as a year from now. Tomorrow I will enter Rome in\ntriumph, and I will have myself declared chief senator of Rome.\nEventually Guy le Gros--Pope Clement, he is calling himself--will crown\nme king of southern Italy and Sicily. As my renown spreads, fighting men\nwill come flocking from all over to join my cause. And they will have to\ncome in on my terms. Then I will be ready to march south.\"\n\nThe whole reason Charles had first sent Simon to Italy--to engineer the\nconquest of the Saracens by Christians and Tartars--was that no longer\nimportant to him? Charles had said nothing about the Tartars since Simon\narrived in Ostia last night.\n\n\"The new Holy Father has already proclaimed his approval of the Tartar\nalliance,\" Simon ventured.\n\n\"Excellent,\" said Charles, nodding. He stood up and poured more wine for\nhimself and Simon.\n\nSitting down again on his camp bed, he went on. \"Your guardianship of\nthe Tartars, too, has been superb, Simon. You proved that I judged\nwisely in picking you for that task. I am delighted.\"\n\nFeeling pleased with himself, Simon took a long drink of the heavy red\nRoman wine. \"Then, since the pope has publicly given his approval, shall\nI escort the Tartars to your brother the king, so they can plan the\ncrusade?\"\n\n\"The crusade?\" Charles lay back on his cot, propped up on one elbow, and\nstared into his wine cup and said nothing further.\n\n\"Would it not be safest to conduct them to the king at once?\" Simon\npressed him. \"Our enemies may still try to kill them, even though the\nalliance is proclaimed.\"\n\nCharles shook his head. \"The last attempt to kill them was many months\nago.\"\n\nTrue, Simon thought. The stalker in black seemed to have given up or\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Yes, but that Sienese attack on Orvieto--\"\n\nCharles interrupted. \"De Verceuil got the Tartars out of Orvieto safely.\nAnd that attack was aimed at the pope, not the Tartars. After all, who\nhas been trying to kill the Tartars, and why? Manfred's agents, because\nthey knew that if the pope approved the Tartar alliance, my brother\nwould then give me permission to march against Manfred.\"\n\nSimon remembered King Louis saying he wanted to be ready to launch his\ncrusade by 1270, now only five years away.\n\n\"But preparations for a crusade take many years,\" Simon said. \"Should\nnot the Tartars go to the king now, so they can begin to plan?\"\n\n\"I do not think they should visit my brother just yet,\" said Charles.\n\"His mind so easily fills up with dreams of recapturing Jerusalem.\"\nSimon caught a faint note of mockery in Charles's voice. \"The presence\nof the Tartars at his court might distract him from his more immediate\nresponsibilities.\"\n\n\"Then what will we do with the Tartars?\" Simon asked, nettled.\n\n\"Let them remain with le Gros's court in Viterbo. It honors the pope to\nhave those strange men from the unknown East at his coronation. Then,\nwhen he comes here to present me with the crown, let them come, too, as\nmy guests. Indeed, they can stay with me after that. They will be safer\nwith me than they would be anywhere else in Italy. And it might interest\nthem to see how Christians make war.\"\n\n_They would be safer still in France._\n\nHe could have taken Sophia and the Tartars to France together, leaving\nthe Tartars safe and well guarded with King Louis, and then going on\nwith Sophia to Gobignon. And getting away from Charles and his war.\n\n\"How many more months will I have to stay in Viterbo guarding the\nTartars?\" he said with some irritation.\n\nCharles put down his wine goblet suddenly and stood up. He seemed to\nfill the tent. The candles on the chest lit his face from below, casting\nghastly shadows over his olive complexion.\n\n\"Simon, I feel I can speak more frankly to you than I ever have. It is\nnearly two years since I asked you to undertake the guarding of the\nTartars. The way you acted today showed me that you've learned a great\ndeal in that time. You have seen the world. You have seen combat. You\nhave learned to lead.\"\n\n_He praises me because I was so quick to mow down a hundred or so\ncommoners_, thought Simon.\n\n\"Thank you, uncle,\" he said tonelessly.\n\n\"I did not summon you from Viterbo just so you could accompany me from\nOstia to Rome, Simon. You saw what my routiers--as you called them--are\nlike. And when I am inside the city I will be in much greater danger\nfrom that Roman canaille than I was in the field today. I need a good\nleader with me whom I can trust. I want you to stay here in Rome with\nme.\"\n\nSimon's chest ached as if chains were wrapped around it.\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"At least two months. By then Sire Adam Fourre, my chief vassal from\nAnjou, will be here with seventy knights and three hundred men. A small\nforce, but one I can depend on. I will feel more in control of these\nbrigands then.\"\n\n\"But who will guard the Tartars while I am here?\" he asked, desperately\ntrying to think of an excuse that would get him back to Sophia.\n\nCharles shrugged. \"De Verceuil can look after them.\"\n\nFor over a year now he had been guarding the Tartars with his life, at\nCharles's request. Now Charles hardly seemed concerned about them. It\nwas bewildering.\n\n_And when will I see Sophia again?_ he cried inwardly.\n\nHe could simply refuse to stay in Italy a moment longer. He could just\nget up right now and leave, go to Viterbo and find Sophia.\n\nNo, he could not do that. He had come to Italy to _redeem_ the name of\nthe house of Gobignon, not besmirch it further. What a scandal if the\nking's brother were to charge that Simon de Gobignon turned his back on\nhim when he was in peril. What would the king and the nobles say of him\nthen in France? He must see this through, at least until Charles was\nsecurely established in Rome.\n\nBut pray God Charles did not ask him to stay with him beyond that.\n\n\"You do not need to go back to the Tartars at all,\" Charles said. \"It\nseems to me that phase of things is settled. I think it would be more\nimportant for you to go home, this summer, to Gobignon.\"\n\nSimon's heart leapt with amazement and joy as the words sank in. \"Yes!\nYes--I want to--very much,\" he blurted out. \"I want that more than\nanything else.\"\n\n_If I can take Sophia with me._\n\nCharles came around the table and laid a heavy hand on Simon's shoulder.\nSimon, still seated, had to twist his neck to look up at him.\n\n\"Do you remember when we first spoke of your guarding the Tartars I\npromised even greater opportunities for glory? I said that you would\nride in triumph through fallen cities.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Simon after hesitating a moment. He knew where Charles was\nleading this, and felt a hollow of dread growing in his stomach.\n\nCharles bent down, bringing his face close to Simon's, his hand still\npressing on Simon's shoulder. The Count of Anjou's eyes glowed green in\nthe candlelight, and Simon felt paralyzed by his gaze, as if Charles\nwere a basilisk.\n\n\"Simon de Gobignon,\" Charles said solemnly. \"I invite you to join me in\nthe conquest of Sicily, and to share with me in the spoils. I ask you to\nbring the army of Gobignon to this war.\"\n\n_God's blood, protect me!_\n\n\"I cannot make my vassals come here,\" Simon ventured. His voice sounded\nweak in his ears.\n\nCharles's face came closer still.\n\n\"_Make_ them come? They will beg you to _let_ them come. This will be\nthe greatest war since you were a child.\"\n\nSimon gathered his thoughts. \"Their obligations to me are limited. Many\nowe me only thirty days' service. Some are not required to serve outside\nGobignon boundaries, need only fight if we are invaded.\"\n\n\"Your father brought four hundred knights and two thousand men-at-arms\nwith him on the crusade my brother and I led into Egypt.\"\n\n_Yes, and lost them all._\n\n\"But that was a crusade, and the ordinary obligations did not apply,\"\nSimon said.\n\n\"This will be a crusade. The pope is going to declare Manfred an\ninfidel, an enemy of the Church, and proclaim a crusade against him. But\nthis will not be like crusading in Outremer, where there is nothing to\nbe gained but sand and palm trees and--spiritual benefits.\" Again Simon\nheard that hint of mockery in Charles's voice. \"Southern Italy and\nSicily are the wealthiest lands in Europe. Riches for everybody! Just go\nback and tell your seigneurs and knights about that. They will plead\nwith you to lead them hither.\" He smiled sarcastically. \"I know what a\ndedicated farmer you are. So get the harvest in--and then bring your\narmy south for the real harvest. The prospect of wintering in Italy\ninstead of in the north should delight them.\"\n\nIn all his life, Simon thought, he had never wanted anything less than\nto lead the knights and men of Gobignon to Charles's war. He thought of\nGobignon, so far away in the northeast corner of France. What business\ndid his people have in Italy? Inevitably, many Gobignon men would die,\nand how would Simon face their families?\n\nBut, sadly, he realized Charles was right in his prediction. Simon could\nthink of dozens of young barons and knights in the Gobignon domain who\nwould ride singing to a war waged for glory and riches.\n\nHe chose his words carefully, not wanting to offend Charles. \"This\nquestion of the crown of Sicily--it does not touch Gobignon in any way\nthat I can see. It would not be right for me to lead my people to war\nover it.\"\n\nSurprisingly, Charles smiled. \"I understand, Simon.\" He patted Simon's\nback. He straightened up and strode back to the other side of the table\nand sat again.\n\n\"You do see my point, uncle?\" Simon said nervously.\n\nCharles nodded, still smiling. \"Why, indeed, should the Count de\nGobignon come to the aid of the Count d'Anjou? I am glad to see a bit of\nshrewdness in you. It means you are growing up. But I will answer you in\none word. Apulia.\"\n\nSimon hunched forward. \"Apulia?\"\n\n\"The southeast of Italy. The richest of Manfred's provinces. Where he\nhas always chosen to live, and his father Frederic before him. Simon,\nCount de Gobignon, Duke of Apulia. How does that sound? In one short war\nyou would double your land holdings and triple your wealth. Now do you\nsee how this war touches you?\"\n\nWhat Simon realized, with a clarity that chilled him, as if he had\nsuddenly seen in Uncle Charles the mark of some dread disease, was that\nhe and Charles d'Anjou were utterly different kinds of men. As Count of\nAnjou and Seigneur of Arles, Charles already ruled a domain bigger than\nGobignon, and he thought it the most natural thing in the world to want\nmore.\n\n_Why do I not want more? Should I? Is something wrong with me?_\n\nIt was all too much for Simon to think through now, while Charles was\npressing so. He had to get away from him. It occurred to him that he\ncould agree now to join forces with Charles, then go back to Gobignon\nand renege on his promise. Charles would be far too busy fighting in\nItaly to try to force him to bring troops from Gobignon.\n\nNo, that probably would not work. It would be stupid to think he could\noutwit a man as experienced in statecraft as the Count of Anjou. Once\nSimon promised, Charles would no doubt find a way to force him to make\ngood.\n\n\"Uncle Charles, I cannot decide in one evening the future of thousands\nof people whose lives and souls I am responsible for.\"\n\nCharles shook his head. His face was darkening; he was getting angry.\n\n\"You sound like my brother, talking about the difficulty of making royal\ndecisions. God's bowels, boy! Deciding what's best for our subjects is\nwhat we were born to do. Where is the Gobignon in you? Your father,\nCount Amalric, for all he went wrong at the end of his life, would have\nknown how to seize a moment like this. How do you think that splendid\ndomain you've inherited was built up? Empires must grow, or they wither\nand die. It is a law of life.\"\n\nSimon was never more glad he was not Amalric's son.\n\n\"I must go back and look at the old agreements and treaties, Uncle\nCharles. I must see what kind of service each baron and each knight owes\nme, and for how long and under what conditions I can call on them. Let\nme see what my rights are as seigneur. Then I will be able to tell you\nhow many knights and men I can bring to you.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself, but I will wager few of them will hold you to the letter\nof their obligations. As I said, when they see the chances for gain,\nthey will want to come. If need be, pay them. Your treasury is fat. You\nhave had no wars to pay for for many years. Whatever you spend, you will\nmake back a hundredfold when we take Manfred's kingdom.\"\n\n_He did not notice that I did not actually promise to bring any men back\nwith me._\n\nTo seem to promise and yet not to promise--Simon felt rather proud of\nhimself for finding a way out. He felt like a fox who had thrown a pack\nof slavering hounds off the scent. He had freed himself from the trap\nAnjou had built for him. Perhaps the count was right. Perhaps this time\nin Italy _had_ done him some good, made him a cleverer man. He drank\ndeeply of the red Roman wine and secretly toasted himself.\n\nHe would honor Charles's request to remain at his side in Rome for a\ntime, fighting for him if need be. Then to Viterbo.\n\nOver a year ago he had agreed to care for the Tartars, and he would be\njudged, and would judge himself, on how well he had done that. He did\nnot like leaving it to de Verceuil. Even if Papa le Gros, as the\nItalians called him, were all in favor of the alliance, the Tartars\nstill had many points to settle before the war--the final war--on the\nSaracens became a reality.\n\n\"Before I return to Gobignon,\" Simon said, \"I must go to Viterbo and\nmake sure that the Tartars are well guarded.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Charles waved a large hand in acquiescence.\n\nTo Viterbo and Sophia.\n\nHe felt again the ecstasy of that day by the lake, the closeness, the\nunion of their flesh. How beautiful it had been! Even here, in Charles\nd'Anjou's tent outside the walls of Rome, he felt a hot stirring in his\nbody at the remembrance of their afternoon of love.\n\nHow could she not want that again? She must. He was sure of it. She\nwanted, as he did, a lifetime of love. That was why she wept whenever he\ntried to convince her that he meant to marry her.\n\nShe had promised him faithfully that the next time they met she would\ntell him what the obstacle was to their marrying. Whatever the reason\nwas, he would sweep it aside and carry her off to Gobignon with him.\n\nFriar Mathieu could marry them before they even left Viterbo. Then if\nGrandm\u00e8re or his sisters had any objections, they would have to swallow\nthem. They could be together in his castle this summer, when the rivers\nwere flowing fast, when the trees were heavy with fruit and the fields\nwere green and the forest was full of fleet deer and clever foxes. How\nshe would love it!\n\nSophia. A thousand visions of her cascaded through his mind, of her dark\nred lips smiling, her eyes glowing like precious stones, her proud\ncarriage. And he remembered the feel of her limbs tangled with his, her\npassion the proof, despite her fears, of the depth of her love for him.\n\nIt would be maddening to stay away from her for the two months Charles\nhad asked of him, but after that they would have the whole of their\nlives together.\n\n\n\n\nLXII\n\n\nSophia heard a murmur from the riders ahead, and looked up. It was\nwarmer here in the south, and she had opened the curtains of her sedan\nchair. Following the path around the side of a hill, the two men\ncarrying her had brought Lucera into view.\n\nIt seemed not to have changed at all in the year and a half since she\nhad left with Daoud and Lorenzo. The octagonal walls and square towers\nof Manfred's citadel, warmed by the setting sun, rose above the small\ncity standing in the center of a plain surrounded by hills.\n\nHer skin tingled at the thought of seeing Daoud again. But her heart,\nwhich should have been light with happiness, ached, tormented for months\nby a decision she could not make.\n\nA cry from the men-at-arms leading the way startled her. Her eyes\nfollowed a pointing arm and saw, high on the rocky slope of a nearby\nhill, a mounted warrior.\n\nHe glittered in the sunset. He was too far away for her to see the\ndetails of his costume, but gold flashed on his breastplate, on his\nhands and arms, and on the white turban that shaded his face. One of\nManfred's Saracens probably, sent out from Lucera to bid them welcome.\n\nShe saw that their path descended gradually into a valley. The Saracen's\nhorse was scrambling down a steep slope to meet them. The warrior leaned\nback in this saddle to balance himself, riding easily down to the valley\nfloor.\n\nAs she drew nearer to him, her heart started to hammer in her chest. The\nlower half of his face was covered by a short blond beard. The face was\nstill in shadow, but the nose was long and straight.\n\nMost of all, it was his carriage that told her who he was. He held\nhimself so perfectly erect that he almost seemed made of some substance\nlighter and finer than ordinary flesh. And yet there was not a trace of\nstiffness in his posture. Like a young tree. Some vessel seemed to open\nwithin her and spread a gentle, joyous balm throughout her body.\n\nAhead of her, Ugolini, alerted by his guards, had thrown back the\ncurtains of his sedan chair and was leaning out. He was bareheaded, his\nwhite side-whiskers fluttering in the breeze. He must be beside himself\nwith excitement, Sophia thought, at the prospect of reunion with Tilia.\n\nThe horseman touched his right hand to his white turban in salute to\nUgolini, and rode on past.\n\nHow splendidly he was caparisoned, from the white plume in his turban to\nhis jeweled, carved stirrups. The breastplate over his long red riding\nrobe was of polished steel, inlaid with gold in Arabic spirals. Jewels\nsparkled on the hilt and sheath of his sword.\n\nHe was close enough for her to see his face clearly. His new beard gave\nhim a commanding, princely look. Seeing him like this, she understood\nbetter what the word _Mameluke_ meant. She felt as if a new sun had\narisen before her. How unbelievably lucky she was to be loved by such a\nman.\n\nBut, like an enemy in ambush, the pain of her indecision struck her in\nthe heart.\n\n_The more fool I am to have betrayed him._\n\nHe drew up beside her and rode around her sedan chair so that the head\nof his glistening black horse was toward Lucera. In a sudden movement he\nleaned down from the saddle. An irresistible arm encircled her waist and\npulled her up out of the sedan chair. For a moment she felt alarmed and\namazed, as if she were flying through the air. Then, before she could\nscream, she found herself comfortably seated across the great horse, her\nshoulder resting on his breastplate, his arms around her.\n\nHer only fear was that she might faint at his touch.\n\nAnd like that they rode into Lucera. Together for all the world to see.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat exquisite irony! She gazed around the bedchamber Daoud had led her\nto, hardly able to believe her eyes. The big bed with its golden\ncurtains was the same, and so was the window with its pointed arch. This\nwas the very room, the very bed, in which Manfred and she had made love\nfor the last time.\n\nManfred must have deliberately chosen to give this room to them.\n\nDaoud's weapons hung on the wall, and his armor was mounted on wooden\nstands. Chests of clothing and other possessions were lined up along the\nwall. Soon the servants would be bringing her things in too.\n\nThis room--another thing she could not tell him about. She despised\nherself. But it might well offend him if he knew of Manfred's little\njoke, and enmity between Daoud and Manfred at this moment could be\ndisastrous.\n\n_Manfred needs Daoud. Why is he so foolish as to risk angering him?_\n\nDaoud and she stood staring at each other. They had said little so far.\nShe felt overwhelmed, and she supposed he did too. She felt her longing\nfor him as a strange not-quite-pain in the pit of her stomach.\n\nHe took her shoulders in his hands. How good to feel his strong fingers\nholding her.\n\n\"How long has this been your room?\" she asked.\n\n\"For about a month. Rather grand, is it not? The king says it is\nsuitable to my rank. I have my own command, a division of his mounted\nMuslim warriors. I call them the Sons of the Falcon.\"\n\n_Suitable to my rank._\n\nShe wondered how much Daoud knew about herself and Manfred.\n\n\"What troubles you?\" he asked.\n\n_So many things._\n\n\"Manfred,\" she said, choosing the worry easiest to speak of.\n\nHe stroked her cheek gently. \"No need to torment yourself. I understand\nhow it must have been.\"\n\n_But would you understand about Simon?_\n\nShe said, \"But can Manfred accept what you and I are to each other?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"You see that we are together in his palace. You saw that I\nrode with you before me on my horse through the streets of Lucera and\ninto Manfred's castle.\"\n\n\"I see that Manfred must know about us. Are you sure he does not want me\nback? It can be fatal to cross a king.\"\n\n\"When we got the message that Ugolini and you were coming here instead\nof going to Viterbo, I talked with Manfred, not as subject and king, but\nas man and man. He was most gracious, as Manfred usually is.\"\n\n\"What did he tell you?\"\n\n\"That indeed he still cares for you. Too much, it seems.\"\n\n\"Too much?\"\n\nDaoud's teeth flashed in his blond beard. \"His queen, the mother of his\nfour children, Helene of Cyprus, usually looks the other way when\nManfred beds beautiful young women. But she saw in you too serious a\nrival. He had to send you off with me, or the queen would have had you\npoisoned.\"\n\nSophia's eyes strayed to the bed in horror. She remembered now that\nbefore she left here, Manfred had hinted at something like that.\n\n\"Poisoned! And I am safe now?\"\n\nAgain the white grin in the blond beard. During the six months they had\nbeen apart, she had begun to think that her love for him might have\nseduced memory and enhanced his good looks beyond reality. But now in\nthe flesh he surpassed even the image her memory had cherished.\n\n\"You are safe as long as you stay away from Manfred and he from you.\nThere will be a feast tonight, in honor of Cardinal Ugolini. You will\nsee how carefully the king will avoid you.\"\n\nDaoud pulled her close to enfold her in his arms. He had taken off his\nsurcoat and breastplate, and with her head against his chest she could\nfeel his heart beating strong and fast under his silk robe.\n\n\"And you?\" she said. \"Do you hate the thought that Manfred and I were\nlovers?\"\n\n_In that very bed._\n\n\"It is far in the past,\" Daoud said. \"Before you met me.\" He held her\naway from him and looked at her with laughter in his blue eyes. \"Even\nthe Prophet married a widow.\"\n\nHis gentle acceptance, his easy assumption that all was over between\nherself and Manfred, tore at her heart. If she even mentioned Simon, it\nwould be different. That was not in the past. That was after she had met\nDaoud, after they became lovers. For the thousand-thousandth time she\ncursed herself for letting it happen.\n\n_God, I am a whore! As bad as the worst painted prostitute plying her\ntrade under the arches by the Hippodrome._\n\nNo, worse than that, in a way. A prostitute had a clear reason for doing\nwhat she did with men. The more Sophia thought about the time she let\nSimon possess her, the less she understood it. And even a prostitute\nknew her occupation and her place in the world. From the night that\nAlexis cast her adrift, Sophia had, in a way, been lost.\n\nBut there came to her a glimmering of hope. Daoud had a place here with\nManfred, and she had a place beside Daoud. Could it be that at last she\nhad a home?\n\nThen she should do nothing to endanger it. She should say nothing about\nSimon.\n\n\"Come to bed,\" he whispered, still holding her and taking a step in that\ndirection.\n\nThe feel of his arms around her and his body pressing against her sent\nripples of need for him through her. But now, with thoughts of Manfred\nand--much worse--of Simon, confusing her, she felt frightened, unready.\nShe needed more time.\n\n\"I have had no proper bath in days, Daoud. I feel the grime of the road\nall over me.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" He smiled. \"And now you can have a proper bath. Let me see\nto it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the year and a half since she left this place, Sophia had all but\nforgotten the bathing rooms in the lowest level of Castello Lucera. She\nhad not used them as much as she had wished to, when she lived here\nbefore. In her strange position as a foreigner and one of Manfred's\nloves, she had not felt comfortable bathing with the other women who\nlived in the castle.\n\nBut tonight, as she and Daoud undressed in the green-tiled anteroom,\nthey had it all to themselves. Daoud must stand high indeed with Manfred\nto have arranged that, she thought.\n\nIn the light of the oil lamp hanging overhead, his naked body was a\ngolden color, and free, as far as she could tell, from the marks of\ninsult the podesta's torturer had inflicted upon it last summer.\n\nShe was not naked. She wore a linen gown that opened down the front. Her\ncontinued worrying over whether or not to tell him about Simon made her\nwant to stay covered as long as she could.\n\nBut with a smile he pulled her gown apart and slipped it off her\nshoulders and down her back to the floor.\n\nA glance down his body told her that he wanted her now. The sight\nthrilled her, but she still felt uneasy and not able to give herself\nwholeheartedly to him and to the act of love.\n\n\"Let us attend to the grime,\" she said with a small smile.\n\nIn the next room, its walls tiled in white, she lay in a round sunken\ntub filled with hot water piped in from the castle kitchen. It was large\nenough for Daoud to stand over her in it. He took over the task of\nwashing her with scented soap imported from Spain.\n\nAt first she simply lay back and enjoyed her renewed acquaintance with\nthe amenities of Manfred's kingdom, so much more like Constantinople\nthan life in the Papal States had been. But as the hot water relaxed her\nand as Daoud's hands, slippery with soap, slid over her skin, she felt\nthe rising warmth of desire. Nothing mattered but this moment. She\nwriggled her legs and hips against him in small, almost unwilled\nmovements.\n\n\"The grime first,\" he said with a soft laugh, and continued methodically\nto soap her until she was mad with wanting him.\n\nHe picked her up in his arms and carried her into the next room, its\ntiles the red-orange of sunset, which was taken up by a great pool of\nvery hot water. Usually this chamber would be occupied by anywhere from\nsix to a dozen men or women. But tonight Sophia and Daoud were quite\nalone.\n\nStill carrying her, he descended the steps into the hot pool. Ribbons of\nsteam rose around them. He lowered her into the water. When she stood\nneck-deep in it, the heat was almost unbearable, as if she were about to\nbe boiled to death. But then the heat soaked into her until her very\nbones felt liquefied. Her whole being melted until she was not a person\nwho felt desire, she _was_ desire itself.\n\nWith her arms around his neck she pulled his head down and kissed him,\nflicks of her tongue tip luring his tongue into her mouth.\n\nHe pressed her back against the warm tile wall, and she knotted her legs\naround his waist as he took her standing up.\n\nMoments later her ecstatic cries were echoing through the bathing rooms.\n\nThey forgot about time.\n\nHer voice rang again and again in the vaulted chamber. They made love in\nthe hot water and then lying on linen cloths on the masseur's slab\nbeside the pool. They nearly fell asleep in each other's arms.\n\nLaughing at their bodies' foolishness, they plunged into the last pool,\ncold water in a blue-tiled room, then hurried through a door to the\nplace where they had started and dressed again.\n\nWhen they were back in their room, Daoud's voice was drowsy as he lay\nbeside her on the gold-curtained bed.\n\n\"You must have bypassed Rome when you came down, with the Count of Anjou\nand Simon de Gobignon both there,\" he said.\n\nAt the mention of Simon's name Sophia's pleasant sleepiness fled, and\nshe felt an ache in the pit of her stomach. Should she tell Daoud or\nnot? She still could not decide. The uncertainty itself had become\nalmost as great an agony as the fear of what would happen if she told\nhim. She rolled over with her back to him, so that he could not see her\nface.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"We went east into the Abruzzi and through L'Aquilia\nand Sulmona. Terribly mountainous country. It took us much longer, but\nit was safer.\"\n\n_But if I do not tell him, every time he takes me in his arms I will\nknow that I am lying to him. I will always be aware that I am keeping\nsomething back from him that he would want to know. I betrayed him with\nSimon, and each time I have the chance to tell him and do not, I am\nbetraying him again._\n\n\"Before Charles took Rome, Lorenzo and Tilia and I passed near the city,\nbut skirted around it. It would not do to have someone from that inn\nrecognize us.\"\n\n\"How well I remember that night.\" It was then that she had first seen\nhow resourceful and how ruthless Daoud could be.\n\n\"Lorenzo and I could talk about it now without getting angry,\" Daoud\nsaid. \"He told me he tried to help the old Jew, Rachel's husband,\nbecause a man does not forget the faith and the people he was born to.\"\n\n\"And you wondered about yourself?\" said Sophia.\n\n\"Exactly.\" The palm of his hand felt wonderfully hard against the flesh\nof her buttocks. \"And, strangely, I found myself thinking of Simon de\nGobignon.\"\n\nShe felt her body stiffen and tried to make herself relax. \"What could\nhave made you think of him?\" She had never told Daoud about Simon's\nshadowed childhood. She wondered if he had heard of it from someone\nelse.\n\n\"I asked myself, what if the Turks had not overrun Ascalon and killed my\nparents and carried me off? And the answer came that I would have been\nvery like Simon de Gobignon. He grew up, you see, having all the things\nI lost.\"\n\n\"What things?\"\n\n\"A family, a home, the Christian faith, freedom, knighthood, his\ncountry. Even his name.\"\n\nThis talk about Simon was making her desperately uneasy. She wondered if\nshe could tell Daoud to go to sleep and forget it all.\n\n\"And I saw at last why I hated him so much,\" Daoud went on. \"I hated him\nin part, of course, because of you. I had already started to love you,\nand the thought of him possessing you made me furious. And yet it was my\nduty to send you to bed with him. Fortunately, that never had to happen.\nBut there was an even deeper reason for my hating him.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" she asked.\n\n\"Envy. Envy that I could not admit to myself.\"\n\n\"Not admit to yourself? Why?\"\n\nHis hand on her was motionless. She sensed that it was an effort for him\nto put his thought into words.\n\n\"Because I was afraid to. That is always why we do not admit a truth to\nourselves. My Sufi sheikh often said, _The things you most fear, those\nyou must turn and stare at until you are no longer afraid_. I was afraid\nI might betray my faith.\"\n\n\"You mean renounce Islam?\" A chill went through her. What a disaster\nfor all of them that could have been. She could well understand how the\nthought of that might frighten him.\n\n\"Yes. I had to put that possibility out of my mind. So I hated Simon de\nGobignon without knowing why. Because I did not understand my hatred, I\nhated him all the more.\"\n\n_If only we could stop talking about Simon._\n\nBut the man she loved was telling her something very important about\nhimself. She had to set her own discomfort aside. She had to listen.\n\n\"And now you do not hate him?\" She turned over in the bed. She wanted to\nsee his face.\n\nThere was a peacefulness in his eyes such as she had never seen before.\nAlways, they had seemed to burn, white-hot. Now they were clear and\nfathomless, like the sky.\n\n\"I do not hate him. I realized, as I rode along with Lorenzo, that if\nyour new faith is strong and your new people are good, you can remember\nwithout danger what you loved of the old. I will always love the sound\nof the Christian priests chanting in the cool dark of a church. I will\nalways feel especially at home in a Christian castle. But the voice I\nhear in the depths of my soul today is the true voice of God, and that,\nSimon de Gobignon will never hear. Unless God's all-powerful hand\nreaches out for him as it did for me.\"\n\nAwed, Sophia said, \"I have never heard anyone speak as you do. With so\nmuch wisdom. Except, once or twice, a priest.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes. \"I speak as I am inspired to speak. In Islam there\nare no priests that stand between God and man. There are the more\nlearned and the less learned, but each man and each woman can hear God.\"\n\nDaoud had bared his soul to her. She wanted to do the same. Love was not\nmerely the coupling of naked bodies, but the union of naked minds. How\ncould she ever be happy with him while lying to him?\n\nBut she did not love Simon. What had happened between them had been a\nmoment of being overwhelmed by feeling. It had been done, not by her,\nbut by Sophia Orfali.\n\nShe had felt sorry for Simon and wanted to comfort him. She had been\nmoved by the purity of his love for her, and her body, which had not\nknown Daoud for months, ran away with her. It was a shameful thing, but\nnot an important thing, because it did not change her love for Daoud.\n\nIt would be important to Daoud, though. He would feel that she had\nbetrayed him. He would want revenge. He would hate Simon.\n\nMost important, the peace with his own childhood, reached after painful\nstruggle, might be destroyed. The beautiful state of mind he had shown\nher might be lost.\n\nFor the sake of his peace, she must keep silent.\n\nShe hated the decision. It meant that a part of her would always be\nlocked away from Daoud, and he would never know it.\n\nVery well, then. Let _that_, and not his wrath at the revelation, be her\npunishment for having let herself go that day with Simon by the lake.\nThat would be the mutilation she would always bear. Perfect union with\nDaoud would be a promised land she would never enter. By suffering that,\nshe would silently make restitution to Daoud for the wrong she had done\nhim.\n\nAll the while she had been thinking, he had been gazing at her. Just as\nshe reached her final decision, his eyes closed and his breathing\ndeepened. She reached out and touched the sparse blond hairs in the\ncenter of his chest, lightly so as not to wake him.\n\n_I lost everything too. He and I are so alike._\n\nMother and Father. Alexis, whom she had loved in the simple way that\nSimon loved her. All lost in one night of fire and steel. And after\nthat, the life she led had been so little like that of other women. A\nlife so strange and venturesome she did not know what to think of\nherself. And yet a life she had loved much of the time.\n\nIf Simon reminded Daoud of what he had lost, almost any woman she met\ndid the same for Sophia.\n\nWhy, she wondered, had a man's seed never quickened within her? She was\ntwenty-four years old, and she had never been with child. Not once since\ngirlhood had her monthly flow of blood failed.\n\n_I am barren_, she thought sadly, as she had countless times before.\n_Barren and alone._ Just as well. Even one baby would have been an\nimpossible burden in the years since she fled to Michael.\n\nBut now, if Daoud were to get her with child, what joy that would be. At\nthis moment, it seemed, she had nothing to do except be a companion to\nDaoud. There had never been a better time in her life for having a\nchild. And even if she could never be wholly one with Daoud, she could\nbe one with their child.\n\nThere were remedies for barrenness, she thought, and sometimes they\nworked. Wise old women knew them. She might seek out such a woman. Tilia\nmust know a great deal about preventing conception, perhaps she knew\nsomething about how to make it happen.\n\nThere would be no more work of the sort she had done for Michael and\nthen for Manfred. She was known in the north. She could not go back\nthere. And once Manfred defeated the French and drove them out of Italy,\nhe would want _men_ to help him govern. A woman had no place in\ngoverning, unless she were married to a man of power or had inherited a\ntitle of her own.\n\nA child, after all this was over, might be all she would have left.\nDaoud could be killed fighting the French. Her heart stopped beating for\na moment, and then began pounding in fear.\n\nShe put that thought out of her mind quickly. She must believe that he\nwould not be killed. And there was good reason to believe so, with all\nhe had survived already.\n\nNo, it was more likely she would lose him when the war was over and he\nwent back to his people. He loved his faith, loved the land that had\nfirst enslaved him, then made him a warrior. And she could never go back\nto Cairo with him. What she had heard about a woman's lot among the\nMuslims sounded like a living death. He had never said so, but he\nprobably had a wife in Egypt. Several wives perhaps, as Muslims were\nsaid to do.\n\nLive as just _one_ of his wives? Her stomach burned at the idea.\nUnthinkable!\n\nCould she persuade Daoud to come with her to Constantinople? Daoud could\nserve the Basileus brilliantly, as a strategos, a general, or as a\nmediator between Byzantines and Saracens. A man of his experience would\nbe invaluable. Ah, but to achieve to the utmost of his ability, though,\nDaoud would have to join the Orthodox Church. And that, after the words\nhe had just spoken, she could never imagine him doing.\n\nWell, but she _could_ imagine it. Why spoil the beautiful dream of\nherself and Daoud together amid the glories of the Polis? For the moment\nshe could indulge her fancy and tell herself anything was possible.\n\nAllowing her mind to drift among these visions, she fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nLXIII\n\n\n\"Ecco! The residence of Cardinal Paulus de Verceuil,\" said Sordello with\na flourish of his hand. The narrow Viterbo street on which Simon,\nSordello, and Thierry had been riding opened out suddenly, and they were\nfacing a huge cylinder built of small stones, blackened with age. Simon\nfelt his mouth fall open in wonder, and he quickly snapped it shut. He\nwould not let anything de Verceuil might do seem to impress him.\n\nThey rode across a drawbridge over a moat full of water that smelled of\nrotting things, its surface coated with a green slime.\n\n\"It looks a bit like Castel Sant' Angelo in Rome,\" Simon remarked.\n\n\"It was a pagan temple in ancient times,\" said Sordello.\n\nAfter passing through the gatehouse, they found themselves in a\nstone-paved semicircular courtyard. The palace was built against the\nrear half of the old Roman inner wall and towered above it.\n\n\"No more lodging with some noble family or other,\" said Sordello\nproudly. \"Now our party has a residence of its own.\"\n\n_I would rather have almost anyone but de Verceuil as my host._\n\nSimon hoped he need stay here for only a short time. Just long enough to\nfind Sophia, overcome her reservations about marrying him, and be off to\nGobignon. His heart beat harder as he thought of seeing her again after\nthose lonely, miserable months in Rome.\n\nThierry took their horses to be stabled, while Sordello ushered Simon\nthrough a cavernous hall lit by a few small windows near the ceiling.\nTwo men-at-arms Simon recognized as part of his troop of Venetian\ncrossbowmen snapped to attention just inside the door, and after a\nfrantic scramble through his memory Simon managed to greet them by name.\n\nTo Sordello Simon said, \"I thank you for meeting Thierry and me at the\ncity gate and guiding us here.\" They crossed the entrance hall. \"After a\nlong ride, one does not want to have to find one's way around a strange\ncity.\"\n\nSordello smiled smugly in acknowledgment. \"Little enough for me to do,\nYour Signory, for one who has done so much for me. Come, I'll show you\nto the room His Eminence has set aside for you.\"\n\nHe led Simon up a great flight of marble stairs from ground level to the\nfirst floor of the mansion.\n\n\"I am capitano of the crossbow troop again,\" Sordello said suddenly,\nhalfway up the stairs.\n\n\"Who decided that?\" said Simon irritably. \"I appointed Peppino capitano\nafter Teodoro was killed.\"\n\nSordello's bloodshot eyes caught Simon's. \"Peppino was most courteous\nabout yielding to me when I rejoined the Tartar ambassadors' guards.\nAfter all, I am senior to him.\" They came to the top of the marble\nstairs, and he held out a hand to indicate stone steps leading to the\nsecond floor.\n\n_Damn!_ Simon had removed Sordello from his position for nearly killing\nthe Armenian prince, and it was pure insubordination for the fellow to\nbully his way back into it in Simon's absence and without his consent.\nIt was typical of Sordello's infuriating combination of guile and gall.\n\nSimon reproached himself for not leaving clear orders on who was to lead\nthe crossbow troop when he left Sordello with them and was off to join\nCount Charles in Rome. But his head and heart had been full of Sophia\nthen. Discipline demanded that he depose Sordello and reinstate Peppino.\n\nYes, he thought, if he were intending to stay here, he would do exactly\nthat. But if he did it and then left again, it would probably only\nprovoke a duel to the death between Peppino and Sordello. Let things be.\nA few weeks from now, at most, he could forget the whole damned lot of\nthem, Tartars and all.\n\nBut Sordello's reemergence as leader of the crossbowmen raised another\nquestion: Would it offend the Armenians?\n\nThey came now to wooden steps leading into the shadowy upper reaches of\nde Verceuil's castle. Simon looked dubiously at them.\n\n\"Trust me, Your Signory, as in any palace, the best apartments are on\nthe top floor.\"\n\n_Trust you? When God invites Lucifer to move back into heaven._\n\nAnd it was equally unlikely that de Verceuil would provide anything\ntruly grand for Simon. He shrugged and let Sordello climb the wooden\nsteps ahead of him.\n\n\"What about the Armenian prince, Hethum? Does he still want your blood?\"\n\nSordello laughed and looked back over his shoulder. \"All settled, Your\nSignory. I know Viterbo, as I know most of these Umbrian hill towns, and\nI entertained all the Armenians for a night and a day, at my expense.\nThe best taverns, the best whorehouses. Hethum and I are friends now.\"\n\nOne did not entertain so lavishly on the fifteen florins a month\nSordello would receive as capitano of the archers. Doubtless he had\nfound other ways to line his pockets.\n\nThe mention of whorehouses reminded Simon of the plight of the girl\nRachel. He must find out if Friar Mathieu had done anything to help her.\n\nOn the musty-smelling fourth floor of the cardinal's palace, Sordello\nled Simon through five connected rooms. Two of them were bare of\nfurniture, but Simon saw rumpled beds and traveling chests in the other\nthree. In the last one a black-robed priest sat at a desk by a window,\nwriting. He frowned at Simon and Sordello as if to reprove them for\ndisturbing him.\n\n\"These are the good apartments?\" Simon said when Sordello ushered him\ninto a bare chamber with a small bed in one corner and a smaller trundle\nbed beside it. The window was large, but covered by wooden shutters.\nSimon pushed them open to let in more light.\n\nSordello shrugged. \"This is truly the best available, Your Signory. The\ncardinal has many people in his employ, and many guests. I would not\nleave those shutters open too long if I were you. Even though it is only\nApril, the flies and mosquitos are numerous already. A wet winter always\nbrings them out.\"\n\n_Not worth the trouble to complain about the room. I won't be here that\nlong._\n\n\"Tell Friar Mathieu I am here, Sordello, and tell Thierry to have a hot\nbath sent up to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Signory. But unless you are willing to wait till midnight, I\nsuggest you go down to the kitchen for your bath. The cardinal's\nservants are obedient to him and care not a fig for anyone else, and\nyour equerry will find none willing to carry a tub of hot water up four\nflights of stairs.\"\n\nThis was too much. \"Now damn your lazy buttocks, Sordello! I am paying\nyou out of my own purse, and you have had no work to do since I left you\nin Perugia. You see that a hot bath reaches me by Vespers, or forget you\nwere ever in my service.\"\n\nSordello's weather-beaten cheeks flushed, but he bowed and left.\n\nSimon leaned on the sill of his window, looking out over the tiled\nrooftops of Viterbo. All the buildings he could see were built of a dark\ngray stone, giving the place an ancient look even though, for all he\nknew, many houses might be quite recently built. This palace Cardinal de\nVerceuil had bought for himself seemed to occupy one of the highest\npoints. Just as Perugia had been bigger than Orvieto, so Viterbo was\nbigger than Perugia. Guards in the black and gold of the local militia\npaced the high city wall from one massive tower to another. About twenty\nyears ago this city had withstood a siege by King Manfred's father,\nEmperor Frederic. That was one of the reasons, Simon had heard, that\nCardinal le Gros, now Pope Clement, had chosen it.\n\nHe heard a rhythmic thumping behind him, then a knock at his door. He\nopened it to see Friar Mathieu, bent and thinner, his white beard\nsparser-looking, leaning on a walking stick. They hugged each other,\nSimon holding the old Franciscan gingerly.\n\n\"The safest place on this floor to talk is the loggia,\" said Friar\nMathieu. \"We can share our news there.\" He bowed to the priest in the\nnext room and greeted him by name and was answered with a grunt.\n\n\"One of de Verceuil's large staff,\" said Friar Mathieu when they were\nout of the priest's chamber. \"It is no accident that his room is next to\nyours.\"\n\n\"I am surprised de Verceuil lets you live here, Father.\"\n\n\"His Eminence would rather have me far away, but Pope Clement insists I\nstay close to the Tartars. And there was a letter from King Louis saying\nthe same. After all, people who speak the Tartars' language are scarce\nthis side of the Danube. And His Eminence may dislike me, but the king\nand the pope both trust me. More, perhaps, than they trust him. So the\ncardinal put me in a cubbyhole near John and Philip, where I am quite\ncontent.\"\n\nThey came to the stairs, where a doorway led out to the loggia. The\nfloor was of red tile, and the walls and columns painted a pale green.\nBenches and potted trees just beginning to bud were set along the\nloggia. They were facing west, overlooking the courtyard. They sat on a\nbench, their faces shaded by the overhanging roof, their knees and feet\nin the sunlight. Simon enjoyed the late afternoon warmth on his legs,\ntired from a week's riding. He looked forward to his bath.\n\n\"I am sure Pope Clement himself will be eager to see you,\" said Friar\nMathieu. \"I hear he has been deluging Count Charles with letters\ndemanding to know when he will march against Manfred.\"\n\n\"Count Charles does not have a big enough army yet to attack Manfred,\"\nsaid Simon, thinking how glad he was to be away from the dour, driven\ncount. \"And it seems that Manfred would rather wait for him to make the\nfirst move. Anjou says he will not be able to recruit more knights and\nmen until the pope officially gives him the crown of southern Italy and\nSicily.\"\n\n\"His Holiness wants Charles to come to Viterbo to be crowned. He refuses\nto set foot in Rome.\"\n\n\"Charles is determined to be crowned by the pope in Rome. He keeps\nmentioning that Charlemagne was crowned in Rome.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu smiled. \"So, the fate of Italy is in the hands of three\nmen who are each unwilling to make a move.\" Sunlight turned his beard to\nsilver. \"And what are your plans? Have you returned to us for good, or\nwill you go back to Count Charles?\"\n\nAt the thought of the prospect before him, Simon felt a warmth within\nrivaling the afternoon sun. \"Tell me, Father--where can I find Cardinal\nUgolini's niece, Sophia?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu's eyes seemed to sink deeper into the hollows under his\nwhite brows. \"Ugolini and Sophia are not here in Viterbo.\"\n\nSimon felt as if a wintry chill had fallen on the loggia. \"What? Where\nhave they gone?\"\n\n\"They never came here. None of us, not even the pope, realized Ugolini\nwas gone until the day of the papal coronation, when he still had not\nappeared. It was a scandal. After all, Ugolini was cardinal camerlengo\nunder Urban. Papa le Gros--Clement--was furious. The rumor is that\nUgolini has fled to Manfred. The pope intends to strip him of his rank\nfor leaving the Papal States without permission.\"\n\nThe pain of loss made Simon cry out, \"But Sophia! What of Sophia?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu shook his head sadly. \"She must be with Ugolini. They are\nprobably both in Manfred's kingdom.\"\n\nSimon fell back against the plaster wall, gasping. \"But--a\nmessage--there must have been a message for me. She must have left some\nword.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" Friar Mathieu spread his hands. \"She knows I am your\nfriend, but I heard nothing from her.\"\n\nIn all the time since he left Perugia, Simon's vision of Sophia, his\ndreams of their life together, had sustained him. He thought constantly\nof her during those dreary weeks while Count Charles was parading around\nRome, giving orders to sullen Italians, exercising his troops, arguing\nwith his captains, and hanging those who made difficulties.\n\nOn a loggia much like this one, at Ugolini's Perugia mansion, Sophia had\nmade the promise that had given him hope. All he needed, he was sure,\nwas to know what stood between them, and he would be able to overcome\nit.\n\nAnd now, as suddenly as if Sophia had been on a ship and a wave had\nswept her overboard, she was gone.\n\nHe felt himself getting angry at Friar Mathieu. He could not believe\nwhat the old priest was telling him.\n\n\"She promised me!\" he blurted out.\n\n\"Promised you what?\" said Friar Mathieu softly.\n\n\"That she would tell me why she could not marry me.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, while Simon stared at the rooftops of Viterbo,\nsilhouetted against a golden sky.\n\n\"You wanted to marry her?\" Friar Mathieu asked in a soft voice.\n\n\"I _want_ to marry her,\" said Simon, his voice sullen.\n\nAfter another long pause he added, \"I was hoping you would marry us.\"\n\n\"Simon,\" said Friar Mathieu quietly. \"How much do you really know about\nSophia?\" Simon thought he heard pity in the old man's voice.\n\nHe felt a twinge of fear, and inched away from the Franciscan. Almost\nagainst his will, his head turned toward Friar Mathieu. He felt himself\nforced to repeat the little that Sophia had told him about herself since\nthey met. The thought of that afternoon by the lake came to him,\nstabbing him like a spear. He would not tell Friar Mathieu about that,\nnot yet. This was not confession.\n\nFriar Mathieu did not meet Simon's intent gaze, but looked downward, and\nSimon saw deep, shadowed pouches under his eyes.\n\n\"Simon--you recall the girl Rachel.\"\n\n_What of her?_ Simon wondered, annoyed at the change of subject. Then he\nremembered.\n\n\"It was Sophia who asked me to speak to you about Rachel.\"\n\n\"Just so. I had already tried everything, including prayer, to get John\nChagan to free Rachel, but I could not move his heart. He prizes her\nalmost to the point of madness. But I did continue my efforts, because\nyou asked me to. I begged, appealed to his better nature--he does have\none--and threatened the fires of hell. Nothing worked. For a time, when\nwe learned that Hulagu Khan had died, we thought that John and Philip\nwould have to go back to Persia. John even spoke of taking Rachel with\nhim and making her his chief wife. Do you have any idea what an honor\nthat would be for Rachel?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Simon impatiently, not caring.\n\n\"Tartars take new wives and concubines, but their chief wives hold that\nstatus for life--usually. For John to say he wants to supplant his chief\nwife with Rachel shows the depth of his passion for the girl.\"\n\n\"Father, what does all this have to do with Sophia?\" Simon burst out.\n\n\"I come to that now. I had long talks with Rachel to find out if she\nreally wanted to be rescued from the Tartar. She told me about her life\nbefore she came to Orvieto, about what it was like in Tilia Caballo's\nbrothel.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"While we talked, Rachel let slip some things about Sophia that--I hate\nto hurt you, Simon, but she said things that made me think Sophia is not\nwhat she has seemed to be.\"\n\nAnger vibrated in Simon's voice. \"I do not want to hear any brothel\ngossip. Rachel is a prostitute and a child. What could she know about a\nwoman like Sophia?\"\n\nHe had an urge to get up and leave. But he realized that behind his\nanger, and fanning it, lurked the fear of learning something he did not\nwant to know.\n\nFriar Mathieu put a gentle hand on Simon's arm. \"Did you tell Sophia\nabout Count Amalric's treason, and about who your real father is?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Because you wanted her to know you. If you love Sophia and want to\nmarry her, you have to know all about her. There is no other way.\"\n\n\"But I want her to tell me, if there is anything to tell.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she cannot.\"\n\n\"Blood of Christ, why are you torturing me?\"\n\nThe old priest shook his head. \"Do you understand that if there were any\nway out of this conversation for me, I would take it?\"\n\nSimon looked at the faded old eyes and saw the pain. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"I do not want to tell you what Rachel said. I respect her confidence.\nAnd I do not like passing on suspicions like this. Come and talk with\nher yourself.\"\n\n\"Right now? Here in this palace?\" Simon shivered with an inner cold.\n\n\"Yes. De Verceuil and the Tartars have been invited to a supper at the\nPalazzo Papale. Rachel is alone in her room. I made sure of that a\nlittle while ago.\"\n\nFeeling like a man going obediently to his own beheading, Simon said,\n\"Let us go and talk to her, then.\"\n\nIn the corridor, Simon saw Sordello and Thierry.\n\n\"Your bath is ready, Monseigneur,\" said Thierry.\n\n\"I will bathe later,\" said Simon, trying not to let the whirlwind of his\nemotions show in his face.\n\n\"There is no way to keep the water warm, Your Signory,\" said Sordello.\n\n\"_Then let it freeze!_\" Simon shouted. He turned away quickly and\nfollowed Friar Mathieu.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSimon at first did not see the small figure huddled in a far corner of\nthe high, gauze-curtained bed. Rachel's room, on the floor below\nSimon's, was much bigger than his. The outer wall, which curved slightly\nbecause it was part of the old temple, was lined with blue-veined white\nmarble. A large window admitted dim light through oiled parchment and\ncurtains.\n\n\"Rachel,\" said Friar Mathieu softly in Italian. \"Here is the Count de\nGobignon, whom I told you of. He is in charge of the men who guard\nyour--protector. He is Madonna Sophia's friend. She has asked him to try\nto help you.\"\n\nSimon felt a twinge of guilt. Could he be Sophia's friend if he was\ntrying to get Rachel to reveal Sophia's secrets? But Sophia had\ndisappeared without a word to him. If she had secrets, he had to know\nthem, even if he had to deceive this child to get at them.\n\nBut at the same time he desperately wanted to learn nothing about Sophia\nthat would hurt him.\n\nRachel used a red ribbon to mark her place in the book she was reading,\nclimbed down from her bed, and curtsied to Simon. Her skin was as white\nas the marble on the wall. She wore a pale blue gown. Her small breasts\npushed it out in front ever so slightly. Simon could see why Sophia had\nkept referring to her as a child. He could not imagine how anyone, even\na Tartar, could want to couple with so delicate-looking a creature.\n\n_Even with books to read and a spacious chamber, she must feel like a\nprisoner._\n\nHe forgot his own anguish momentarily in pity for her plight. He wanted\nto take the wide-eyed girl gently in his arms and hold her.\n\nSimon and Friar Mathieu sat on small gold-painted chairs, and Rachel sat\non the edge of her bed. Simon racked his brain for a way to start the\nconversation. It must seem to be about Rachel, but it must tell him\nabout Sophia. He was not even sure what he was trying to find out.\n\nEven though he had not spoken and had tried to look friendly and not\nthreatening, he could imagine how much his presence must frighten her. A\nFrench count. To her that must almost be like being visited by a king.\nAnd she probably feared Christians anyway. If she decided she must\nprotect Sophia from him, he would get nothing from her.\n\nSimon was grateful when Friar Mathieu cleared his throat and spoke.\n\n\"Count Simon is anxious about your welfare, my dear,\" said the old\nFranciscan. \"He was quite surprised to learn that Cardinal Ugolini and\nMadonna Sophia had not followed the pope here to Viterbo. He was\nwondering whether Madonna Sophia had left some word with you about where\nshe was going.\"\n\nRachel shook her head. \"I have not seen her since John took me from\nMadama Tilia's house.\" Her black hair was wound in braids around her\nhead, exposing her small ears, made to look smaller still by the large\ngold hoops she wore in them. Similarly, a gold necklace with a jeweled\npendant emphasized the slenderness of her neck. Her arms and hands\nseemed weighed down with bracelets and rings. The Tartar must be\nshowering her with gifts.\n\n\"And Madonna Sophia gave no hint of her plans when she visited you at\nMadama Tilia's?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu asked it as if it were the most natural question in the\nworld.\n\n_My God, what would Sophia be doing at Tilia Caballo's? At a brothel!_\n\nSimon felt his stomach clench. He did not want to hear Rachel's answer.\n\n\"No, Father. The last thing she told me was that everyone would be\nleaving Orvieto soon. And when we did, I would not have to stay with\nMadama Tilia anymore. I begged her to take me back with her to Cardinal\nUgolini's, but she said she could not. Later that day John came for me.\nI never spoke with Madonna Sophia again.\" She looked uneasily at Simon.\n\nSophia had said she knew about the girl only through the gossip of\nservants and townspeople. Could this girl be lying about having met\nSophia? But she would have no reason to do that. So it must have been\nSophia who lied about never having met Rachel. He felt as if a dagger\nhad struck him in the back.\n\nAnd she had certainly never said anything about going to Tilia\nCaballo's. How could he learn the true connection between Sophia and\nRachel without making Rachel suspicious?\n\n\"That is just it, Rachel,\" he said. \"Things have been happening so\nrapidly, and I was away from the pope's court and the Tartar ambassadors\nfor months. Sophia and I have not had time to talk to each other or to\nsend messages. But when I last saw her, she asked me to look after you.\nShe cares very much for you.\"\n\nRachel smiled faintly. Her lips were a pale pink. Her eyebrows were\nblack and straight over her dark brown eyes, giving her an earnest look.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Your Signory. I know she cares for me.\"\n\n\"Are you also from Sicily, Rachel?\" Simon asked. \"Did you know Sophia's\nfamily in Sicily?\"\n\n\"No, Your Signory. I am from Florence.\"\n\nFlorence. Florence was controlled by the Ghibellini.\n\n\"Does anyone in your family know you are here with this Tartar? Is there\nanyone you would like me to get a message to?\"\n\nRachel's eyes widened and filled with tears. \"They are all dead, Your\nSignory. And if any of them were living, I would rather be dead myself\nthan have them know what has happened to me.\"\n\n\"Then Sophia is the only friend you have in the world?\" Simon waited a\nmoment, then tried a blind guess. \"Perhaps Sophia has gone back to the\nplace where you first met her.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Rachel. Suddenly, she looked terrified. She shrank back\nfrom Simon.\n\n_She is dreadfully frightened_, Simon thought.\n\nFriar Mathieu was right. Sophia was hiding something. Anguish stabbed\nSimon again.\n\n\"What is it, Rachel?\" said Friar Mathieu. He shook his head at Simon.\n\n\"If you want to help me, if you love her, just leave me alone. She was\nkind to me as no one else has ever been. She was my friend. Stop trying\nto find out about her.\"\n\nWhat was this girl hiding? What was Sophia hiding? Simon felt as if he\nwere surrounded by enemies, all of them plunging their daggers into him.\n\n\"Does a friend send a young girl like you to a brothel?\" said Friar\nMathieu softly.\n\nThis brought no reply from Rachel. She put her hands to her face and\nsobbed.\n\nSimon could bear no more. He stood up abruptly. He was torturing this\ngirl. And in a way, she was torturing him.\n\nHe said, \"Rachel, we will leave now. I am sorry I frightened you. In\ntruth, I have no wish to hurt you. But, I--I am upset too. Listen to me.\nIf you ever decide you want to get away from here, tell me. I will not\nlet John or Cardinal de Verceuil or anyone else stop you if you want to\nbe free.\"\n\nRachel took her hands away from her face. \"Where can I go? Tell me that,\nYour Signory. Where can I go?\" Her eyes, rimmed with red from crying,\nwere pools of darkness in her pale face. The sight of her tears made\nSimon's own eyes burn.\n\nFriar Mathieu stood up, leaning heavily on his stick. He took Simon's\narm, whispered a good-bye to Rachel, and drew Simon out of the room.\nSilently they went back up to the top-floor loggia. Simon seethed and\nchurned, his mind full of confusion and pain.\n\nThey sat together on a bench in the deepening twilight. The sun was down\nand the sky over the distant hills was copper-colored.\n\n\"How clumsy I was,\" Simon said. \"She will tell us nothing now.\"\n\n\"You learned quite a bit,\" said Friar Mathieu, \"if you think about what\nshe told you.\"\n\n\"I know this much,\" said Simon. \"I have been a fool. Sophia has been\nlying to me.\"\n\n\"Everyone in love is a fool, Simon. The more in love, the more they want\nto believe whatever the beloved tells them. Only a man or woman in love\nwith God can be a fool without risk.\"\n\nFrom the distant walls of Viterbo, the guards called the hours to one\nanother. Their long-drawn cries echoed against the stone building\nfronts.\n\n\"What did you mean, think about what she told me?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu sighed. \"Rachel said that Sophia told her after they left\nOrvieto she would not _have_ to stay with Tilia Caballo anymore. Rachel\nwas not at Caballo's of her own free will. And you may have noticed that\nwhen I suggested that Sophia sent her there, she did not deny it.\"\n\nSimon felt another rush of anger at Friar Mathieu for trying to make him\nbelieve evil of Sophia. \"Are you saying that Sophia forced that girl\ninto a brothel? Father, Sophia is too much of an innocent to be a party\nto anything like that.\"\n\nBut he remembered that moment of deepest intimacy they had shared last\nautumn outside Perugia, the moment he had delighted in reliving\nthousands of times. She had surprised him with the suddenness of her\npassion, with the swift, sure way she had guided him into taking her and\nhad taken pleasure from him. Of course, he had thought, she would know\nwhat to do. She had been married. But surely a chaste widow who had\nknown only one man in her life would have shown some hesitation, some\ntimidity, some inner struggle?\n\nSimon felt rage building up within him. He hated these doubts. He wanted\nto lash out at someone.\n\nFriar Mathieu's voice came to him again, mild but inexorable. \"Rachel\nsaid she asked Sophia to take her _back_ to Ugolini's. Rachel must have\nlived at Ugolini's when she first came to Orvieto. If you say that\nSophia could not have been the one who put Rachel in Caballo's house, I\naccept it. But Ugolini could have. Or David of Trebizond.\"\n\n\"You will drive me mad. Stop going step by step like a schoolman. Of\nwhat are you accusing Sophia?\"\n\nOnly his reverence for Friar Mathieu kept him from shaking the old\npriest.\n\nFriar Mathieu patted Simon's knee. \"I am going step by step because I\nmyself am trying to think this out. And I want to be sure, for your\nsake. Rachel knew something, or had learned something. So they put her\nin Caballo's brothel for safekeeping.\"\n\n\"They?\"\n\n\"Ugolini. David of Trebizond. And Sophia, at the very least, must have\nknown the reason, or she would not agree to let Rachel go to the\nbrothel. If Sophia knew so much, then perhaps--I say perhaps--she knew\nmore about Ugolini and David and their dealings than she admitted to\nyou. I keep thinking of that night at the Palazzo Monaldeschi when she\ndrew you to the atrium, conveniently for David of Trebizond, who was\ngoading the Tartars into publicly embarrassing themselves. Was she as\nuninvolved then as she led you to believe?\"\n\nEach of Friar Mathieu's sentences was another dagger blow, plunging deep\ninto Simon, sending agony through him, the sharp point searching out his\nheart.\n\nFriar Mathieu was proceeding in the same painstaking way he had probed\nAlain's body until he discovered what killed him. Alain, whose murderer\nhad never been found, who had died outside Ugolini's mansion.\n\n_Alain! Oh, my God! Could she have known how he was killed?_\n\n_What had really been happening at Ugolini's mansion?_\n\nSimon bent double, digging his fingers into his skull. His head might\nburst apart if he did not hold it tightly. Could all the love he thought\nhe had found in her be a lie? Could she be an _enemy_?\n\n\"You are destroying my life,\" he muttered, his hands over his face.\n\nHe felt the light touch of the old man's hand on his shoulder. \"When a\nleg wound festers, the surgeon has to cut the leg off to save the man's\nlife.\"\n\n_And the old soldiers tell me the man always dies anyway_, Simon thought\nbitterly.\n\n\"I am doing this not just for you, Simon,\" Friar Mathieu went on. \"There\nwas a secret war being waged in Orvieto to prevent us from allying\nourselves with the Tartars. The person behind it was probably King\nManfred of Sicily, who wants to keep Charles d'Anjou out of Italy.\nUgolini was Manfred's agent. And Sophia may have been Ugolini's weapon\nagainst you.\"\n\n_No! Impossible! I love her. I could not love her if she were on the\nside of evil._\n\nSimon struck his knee with his fist. \"I must find out the truth. I must\ngo after her.\"\n\n\"After Sophia?\"\n\n\"Yes. If she is in Manfred's kingdom, I will find her and get her out.\"\n\n\"Whatever Sophia has done, she has already done, Simon. You cannot undo\nit, or simply pretend that she has done nothing at all.\"\n\nSimon lurched to his feet. Staggering in his agony, as if those knives\nwere still striking him from all sides, he reached the railing of the\nloggia and gripped it. The sky had deepened to violet, and a single\nsilvery star glowed in the west. He remembered the magic his mother had\ntaught him of wishing on a star. He could not wish this awful pain away.\n\n\"I do not know what she has done. And I refuse to believe ill of her\nuntil I have spoken to her.\"\n\n\"But you cannot go into Manfred's kingdom and look for her. You are\ncertain to be caught and imprisoned. You could very well be killed.\"\n\nSimon turned. Friar Mathieu was a dim figure huddled in the deep shadows\nof the loggia, his beard a light patch in the darkness.\n\n\"You think Manfred is behind all this,\" Simon said.\n\n\"Yes. Look you, when Urban died and Clement was elected--it was the\nletter you carried from King Louis that broke the cardinals'\nstalemate--Ugolini and Sophia saw they could do no more at the papal\ncourt, and they left. Maybe they were afraid they would be discovered.\"\n\nManfred. Simon knew little about King Manfred. Up to now he had hardly\nany reason to dislike him, and so had no reason to join Count Charles in\nmaking war on him.\n\nNow all was changed. It plainly had to be to Manfred that Sophia had\nfled. And if Sophia had betrayed him, she must be serving Manfred.\n\nAnd Mathieu was right. He could not go alone into Manfred's kingdom and\nbring Sophia out. If she had lied and betrayed him, she not only would\nrefuse to come with him, she doubtless would betray him again, and he\nwould end up a prisoner.\n\nBut there was another way he could go after Sophia.\n\nWith an army at his back.\n\nYes, he would go to Gobignon and send out his heralds. He would summon\nhis vassals to a council of war at the ch\u00e2teau. Then, after the harvest\nwas in, he would ride forth under the purple and gold banner of the\nthree crowns with all the power of Gobignon behind him.\n\nHe would find Sophia if he had to tear Manfred's kingdom apart to do it.\nFind her and get the truth. As his wife or as prisoner, she would be\nhis!\n\n\n\n\nLXIV\n\n\nOn a dais high above Simon, on a gilded throne under a cloth-of-gold\ncanopy, Charles d'Anjou sat, wearing the crown studded with rubies,\nemeralds, and sapphires placed on his head by Cardinal Paulus de\nVerceuil, as legate for Pope Clement, a few hours ago. Simon stood below\nhim in a half-circle of Roman nobles and Charles's commanders. The\nTartars and Friar Mathieu were beside Simon.\n\nBehind them, the great hall of the Palazzo Laterano, Roman residence of\nthe pope, was packed with French seigneurs and knights and the popolo\ngrosso of Rome. The hall was stifling, and Simon felt sweat trickling\ninside his tunic. Even in early May Rome was already too hot to live in.\nHe wondered how Anjou and his army would manage to survive the summer\nhere.\n\nAnjou beckoned to Gautier du Mont, who swept his cap from his\nbowl-shaped head of hair and hurried up the dozen steps, a sword that\nreached to his ankle swinging at his side.\n\nSimon felt a hollow in his stomach large enough to hold all of Rome.\nSoon Charles would call him up to the throne, and he would have to give\nhim an answer. A month ago in Viterbo he had been determined to bring\nthe Gobignon army to Italy. In the intervening days, doubts had\nunsettled him. Did he really dare to commit the fighting men of his\ndomain to the war? Each time he tried to decide, his mind gave a\ndifferent answer, like dice endlessly tossed. His head ached and his\neyes burned from lying awake all last night after his arrival in Rome\njust in time for the coronation.\n\nOver and over again he heard what Friar Mathieu had said: _Not so long\nago you even doubted your right to be Count de Gobignon. And are you now\nready to lead the men of Gobignon to bloodshed and--for many of\nthem--death?_\n\nDu Mont had finished his conversation with Charles and, with repeated\nbows, was descending from the dais with his face toward the throne and\nhis hindquarters to the gathering. Now that Anjou was a king, one did\nnot turn one's back on him. A far cry from du Mont's behavior toward\nCharles of only a few months earlier, and another mark of Charles's\nincreased stature since his arrival at the gates of Rome. Still, he had\nbeen required to compromise on his coronation. He had been crowned in\nRome as he wanted, but not by the pope. Only de Verceuil, who felt\nhimself exalted by the occasion, was perfectly happy with that\narrangement.\n\nAs du Mont rejoined the crowd at the base of the throne, Simon's eye was\ndrawn to the red silk cross sewn on his blue tunic. After the\ncoronation, the pope's proclamation of a crusade against Manfred had\nbeen read. Charles's men must have had their crosses sewn on in\nanticipation.\n\nMen like du Mont, von Regensburg, and FitzTrinian were now holy\nwarriors, all of whose past sins were forgiven. If any of Charles's\nfollowers should die in battle, they would go straight to heaven.\n\nHaving seen those cutthroats in action, Simon thought their new state of\nholiness absurd. But now that Pope Clement had declared the war against\nManfred a crusade, it would be so much easier to recruit an army from\nGobignon.\n\nSimon wore no cross, an outward sign of his indecision.\n\nAn equerry in red and black whispered to Friar Mathieu, who turned and\nspoke to the Tartars. John and Philip ceremoniously unbuckled their\njeweled belts and draped them over their necks. As the bowlegged little\nmen started up the steps, Simon heard snickers from among Charles's\nofficers at this Tartar gesture of submission. The more fools they, he\nthought, to laugh at the customs of men who had conquered half the\nearth. Friar Mathieu followed the Tartars, holding the equerry's arm.\n\nInnumerable conversations, echoing against the vaulted ceiling of the\ngreat Lateran hall, battered on Simon's ears. To his right he heard\nCardinal de Verceuil's deep booming. Unwillingly, he turned, and saw the\ncardinal's wide-brimmed red hat, its heavy tassels swinging, rising\nabove the crowd as did the voice coming from beneath it. De Verceuil was\nhappy to dress like a cardinal today, since he was taking the place of\nthe pope. Simon knew he would soon be trading his scarlet regalia for\nmail. Eager to share in the spoils of Manfred's kingdom, he was going\nback to France to raise an army from his fiefs and benefices scattered\naround the country.\n\nSimon saw several other cardinals' hats here and there in the crowd. He\nwondered if any of the Italian cardinals supported Charles's adventure.\n\nNone of them disapproved openly, that was certain. Only Ugolini had\nprotested, and his form of protest had been flight. Enough to cost him\nhis red hat. By papal decree Adelberto Ugolini was no longer\ncardinal-bishop of Palermo. Simon had sought out priests and merchants\ntraveling from southern Italy, asking them what had become of Ugolini.\nBut news from the south was sparse these days, and news of Ugolini\nnonexistent.\n\nSimon had spoken in Viterbo to a pair of Dominican friars recently come\nfrom Palermo. They had known Ugolini before he became a cardinal, but\ndid not remember that he had any sisters, much less a niece. They had\nnever heard of a Siracusa family called Orfali. Simon raged at his\ninability to learn anything at all about Sophia. It was as if she had\nfallen into a black pit.\n\nJohn and Philip were kneeling before Charles at the top of the steps.\nFriar Mathieu stood beside the Tartars, interpreting for them and for\nKing Charles. Charles was talking loudly enough for Simon to hear. Like\nmany men, he tended to raise his voice when addressing those who did not\nspeak his language.\n\n\"You must tell the great Abagha Khan that it is customary for rulers to\nsend gifts to newly made kings. Tell him we look forward with delight to\nthe wonderful things he will send us from the Orient.\"\n\nMore useful, in Simon's opinion, would be a detailed proposal from the\nlate Hulagu Khan's son on how and when Christians and Tartars should\nlaunch their war on the Saracens. Stories had come from the East that\nHulagu Khan's frustration over his failure to conquer the Mamelukes had\nhastened his death.\n\nAs he waited to climb the stairs and kneel before the new king, Simon\nreminded himself that he could still refuse to join Charles's war on\nManfred.\n\nHe became aware of the dull pain around his heart that had been with him\never since he discovered that Sophia had vanished. Even when he forgot\nthe suffering, it weighed down his footsteps and bowed his shoulders.\n\n_And the worst of it is that I would rather live perpetually with this\nmisery than stop loving Sophia._\n\nBut how could he go on loving her if she had been his enemy all along?\n\nWas there any such person as Sophia Orfali? All the time he was courting\nher, she could have been working against the alliance. She might even\nhave known the man in black who had nearly killed him.\n\nThat thought struck him like a bolt of lightning. For a moment, he was\nblind to the sights around him, deaf to the sounds.\n\n_No! It cannot be!_\n\nIf she really had been that evil, it could be only because she had been\ncorrupted by living in Manfred's kingdom. He remembered the words of de\nVerceuil's sermon this morning at Count Charles's coronation.\n\n_The Hohenstaufens, that brood of vipers, have too long vexed Holy\nChurch, persecuting pope after pope. May it please God that the bastard\nManfred be the last of them. May we see the destruction of that family\nof blasphemers and infidels, secretly in league with the Saracens. We\ndeclare Manfred von Hohenstaufen anathema and outlaw. Blessed be the\nhand that strikes him down._\n\nIf it was Manfred who had turned Sophia into a tool of the infidels,\nthen how right that Simon's hand be the one to strike Manfred down.\n\nNow, bowing, the Tartars were carefully backing down from the royal\npresence. Friar Mathieu turned and teetered precariously at the top of\nthe steps. Charles, seeming not to understand the Franciscan's\ninfirmity, stared at him without moving from his seat. The equerry who\nhad helped him climb made a move toward him, but Simon was already up\nthe steps and gripping the old Franciscan's arm.\n\n\"Thank you, Simon.\" Friar Mathieu turned to Charles. \"Sire, I hope you\nwill forgive the sight of this old man's back. I am afraid my legs lack\nthe power to climb downstairs backward.\"\n\n\"To be sure, Father, to be sure.\" Charles waved a hand in dismissal.\n\nIf King Louis were on that throne, Simon thought, he would probably have\nlifted Friar Mathieu in his own arms and carried him down. Simon so\nwished it were Louis, rather than Charles, he was serving. But perhaps\nby serving Charles he was serving Louis.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nSimon and Friar Mathieu descended a step at a time. Friar Mathieu was\nleaning on Simon, but he seemed to weigh nothing.\n\n\"Count Simon,\" Charles called when Simon reached the bottom. \"I would\nspeak with you next.\"\n\nWhen Simon mounted the dais, Charles ordered his herald in red and black\nto call for silence.\n\n\"All honor to Simon, Count de Gobignon!\" Charles called from the throne\nwhen he had the attention of the assembly. \"For nearly two years he has\nguarded the ambassadors from Tartary. He has risked his very life in\nbattle for them. His sagacity and bravery have brought new glory to his\nancient name.\"\n\nSimon felt dizzy with exaltation. He had not expected this, from the\nnewly crowned king. His face burned. At a gesture from Charles, he\nturned to face the crowd. The gathering in the great hall of the Lateran\nwas a multicolored, murmuring blur. The dais on which he stood seemed\nsuddenly turned into a mountaintop.\n\n\"Now,\" Charles went on, \"Count Simon and his vassals join us as allies\nin battle against the godless Manfred. May the deeds he has yet to do\nbring even more renown to the house of Gobignon. I guarantee you,\nMesseigneurs, the day will come when Simon de Gobignon will be known as\none of Christendom's greatest knights.\"\n\nSimon's bedazzlement at Charles's tribute to him turned in an instant to\nanger. By publicly announcing a decision Simon had not yet made, Charles\nwas trying to force him to commit himself to the crusade. For a moment\nSimon was tempted to tell Charles that he would crusade at his side when\nthe Middle Sea froze over.\n\nBut as he stood looking down at Charles's barons and the nobles of Rome,\nhalf turned toward Charles, half turned toward the assembly, the\nclapping and cheering were overwhelming him. His eye was drawn by a red\nhat above the rest of the crowd, and he was delighted to see that de\nVerceuil's face seemed a deeper red than his vestments.\n\nSimon's anger at Charles faded as the moment lifted him up in spite of\nhimself.\n\nHe who had dwelt in the shadow of treason all his life, who had hidden\nhimself, when in great assemblies, for fear he would be noticed and\ntreated with scorn, now honored by this multitude in the capital of\nChristendom in the age-old palace of the popes!\n\nWas it not to achieve this that he had come to Italy?\n\n_If only Sophia could see._\n\nHe did what he felt was required, and knelt before Charles, taking the\nnew king's extended hand and kissing a huge ruby ring.\n\nIn a low voice Charles said, \"I have prayed that I would have your help,\nSimon. Can you not tell me that my prayer has been answered?\"\n\nIf he refused Charles and went back to Gobignon, he would never see\nSophia again. And he would probably never again know a moment like this,\nwhen he felt so _right_ as the Count de Gobignon.\n\nBut he was still offended by Charles's claiming a commitment that Simon\nhad not given him.\n\n\"It seems you already know your prayer has been answered, Sire.\"\n\nCharles frowned for a moment, then smiled and patted Simon on the\nshoulder. \"Forgive me. I want so much for you to join me that I spoke as\nif it were already true. Will you make it true?\"\n\nHe looked up into Charles's large, compelling eyes and nodded slowly.\n\n\"I will come after the harvest is in, Sire. I will come with my army.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRachel slid from the bed, trying to shake it as little as possible so as\nnot to wake John. Letting her robe of yellow silk flutter loosely about\nher nude body, she hurried behind the screen that hid her commode and\nopened the chest that held her most private belongings. She took out the\ndevice of bladder and tubing Tilia had given her long ago, and with a\npitcherful of lukewarm water washed John's seed out of herself quickly.\nOver the year and more that she had been with John, she had never let\nhim see her using the thing. Men such as John, she knew, took pride in\ntheir power to get a woman with child.\n\nShe was fourteen now, and her breasts were filling out. Many women had\nbabies at fourteen. She would have to be more careful than ever. She\nstretched her mouth in a grimace at the thought of a baby that looked\nlike John.\n\nAs usual, she had endured, not enjoyed, the Tartar's mating. Another\nchange she had noticed in herself, though, was that she had begun to\nunderstand how women could feel pleasure with a man. Several times since\nlast spring a yellow-haired man had appeared naked before her in her\ndreams, and had lain with her. When she woke she could not remember the\nman's face, but she still felt the exquisite sensations his body gave\nher, and she sometimes had to caress herself until a surge of pleasure\nrelieved the yearning stirred up by her dream.\n\nOther times, when John came to her late at night and she was very\nsleepy, she closed her eyes and was able to imagine that the\nyellow-haired man was with her, and then she actually enjoyed John's\nattentions, which pleased him very much.\n\nShe tied the robe's sash and went to the window. The breeze from the\nwest was strong and salt-smelling, and she was thankful that she was\nhere, in a villa by the sea, and not in Rome. August, they said, killed\none out of every three people in Rome. She sat on the wide sill and\nlooked out. She did not lean out too far; she was four stories up,\noverlooking jagged boulders piled along the shore.\n\nAfternoon sunlight sparkled on the Tyrrhenean Sea, and a flash of sun on\nthe helmet of a guard patrolling the beach caught her eye. One of\nSordello's Venetians, she thought, judging by his bowl-shaped helmet and\nthe crossbow he carried. The men-at-arms of the Orsini family, who had\nlent this villa to the French party, wore helmets shaped to the head,\nwith crests on top.\n\nShe heard the bed creaking behind her, and the Tartar groaned.\n\n\"Pour me another cup of wine, Reicho,\" he called.\n\n\"You have had three cups already, Usun,\" she said, but obediently went\nto the table and poured red wine from a flagon into his silver cup.\n\nHe had taught her his original Tartar name, Usun, and he liked to hear\nher say it. With the help of Friar Mathieu and Ana the Bulgarian, she\nhad learned to understand and speak his language fairly well. She knew\nnow that \"Tartar\" was merely a European word for his people, that they\ncalled themselves \"Mongols.\"\n\nHe pulled his silk trousers up and knotted the drawstring. His belly had\nbeen flat when she first met him. Now it was swollen as if _he_ were\nhaving a baby, and excess flesh sagged on his shoulders and chest. His\ndecline was partly from too much wine and partly from too little\nactivity. She rarely saw John without a wine cup in his hand, and by\nevening he was often surly or in a stupor. He talked to her less, and\nwas less often able to couple with her. If he spent many more months\nlike this, he would sicken and die like a wild bird kept in a cage.\n\n\"I had _six_ cups this morning before I came to you,\" he boasted. \"Wine\nmakes me strong.\" He drank off half his cup and set it on the marble\ntable.\n\nShe sat beside him on the rumpled bed. \"You need to get out, Usun. Go\nriding.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Too hot.\" He grinned, stroking his white beard. \"But next\nyear we will ride to war.\"\n\n\"Next year?\"\n\n\"King Charr has promised to let me and Nikpai--Philip--ride to war with\nhim when he attacks Manfred.\"\n\nIn her anxiety she seized John's arm--she rarely touched him--and said,\n\"You must insist that your guardians let you go out riding regularly.\nAnd you must stop drinking so much wine. Otherwise you will be very\nsick.\"\n\nHis black eyes were wider and moister than usual. \"You worry about me,\nReicho?\"\n\nShe took her hand from his arm. \"I don't want to see you die,\" she said.\nShe did not know why she felt that way. After all, he had enslaved her,\nand every time he possessed her body it was virtually rape. And if he\ndied, she might be free. But, she supposed, she had gotten to know him\nso well that she felt sorry for him.\n\nShe did not like to hear about this war against King Manfred. Friar\nMathieu had told her gently that her lost friends, Sophia, David, and\nthe others, were very likely all spies for Manfred. If Sophia were in\nKing Manfred's employ, that made no difference to Rachel. From all she\nhad heard, Jews were better treated in Manfred's kingdom than anywhere\nelse in Italy. The French, on the other hand, were often cruel to Jews.\nIt would bring sorrow and suffering to many people if Charles d'Anjou\nconquered southern Italy and Sicily.\n\nShe wished she could be with Sophia. But Sophia was probably in Sicily,\nand how could Rachel, all alone, cross half of Italy to find her?\n\nThe locked box she kept under the bed, which held all the gold and\njewelry Usun had given her, was far too big and heavy for her to carry.\nAnd even if she could escape and take it away with her, she could not\nprotect herself from robbery. But it would be the worst sort of\nstupidity to leave without it. It was all she had from these awful\nyears. It was less like a treasure, though, than like a block of stone\nto which she was chained.\n\nIf she were ever to escape, she would first have to get away from the\nguards, the Armenians and the Venetians, all of whom had orders to watch\nher and make sure she did not run away. That Sordello, the capitano of\nthe Venetians, seemed to have his eyes on her whenever she went out of\nher room.\n\nShe was alone in the world. Nowhere to go. There were moments when she\nfelt so lost and unhappy she wanted to climb out the open window of her\nroom and throw herself down to the rocks.\n\n\"Maybe next year, when King Charr goes to war, I will not be here,\" Usun\nsaid suddenly.\n\n\"You must wish you could be back with your own people,\" she said.\n\n_If I am lonely, think how he must feel. Except for Philip, there is no\none like him anywhere in this part of the world. Only a few people speak\nhis language. Everything looks strange to him._\n\n\"We are waiting for orders from our new master, Abagha Khan,\" said Usun.\n\"Another letter must come soon. It is now six months since his father\ndied.\"\n\nRachel felt her heart fluttering with anxiety. \"And when Abagha Khan's\nmessage comes, what do you think it will say?\"\n\n\"He will order us either to go to the king of the Franks or to go back\nto Persia.\" He took a swallow of wine. Rachel saw that his white beard\nwas stained pink from all the red wine he had spilled on it.\n\n\"Then you might go home again?\" said Rachel. \"Would you like that?\" Her\nhands trembled, and she twined her fingers together in her lap to still\nthem.\n\nUsun laughed and drank. \"Not home, Reicho. My home is farther away from\nPersia than Persia is from here. It is so far away and there are so many\nenemies in between that I may never see it again. But I do not care. My\npeople have a fine domain in Persia.\"\n\nHe drank, and held out his empty cup. She filled it with a shaking hand.\nIf he went back to Persia, she might be free of him. Unless her worst\nfears turned out to be true.\n\n\"So, you may soon say good-bye to me.\" She dared not let him see how\neager she was for him to be gone.\n\nHe looked up at her, and the light from outside etched the thousand tiny\ncriss-crossed wrinkles around his eyes. \"No, Reicho. If I go back, you\nmust come with me.\"\n\nHer heart turned to ice, just as if he had told her he was going to kill\nher. She had suspected this and had prayed it would not be so.\nEverything he said and did, from the day he took her from Tilia's house,\nshowed that he meant never to let her go. She was to be his prisoner for\nlife.\n\n\"Usun,\" she said, trying to keep her voice calm, \"I do not want to go\nwith you.\"\n\nHe stared at her, his brown face wooden.\n\n\"You are afraid,\" he said. \"But you must not be. When you come with me,\nyou will be a very great lady. I am a baghadur. I am as great a lord as\nKing Charr is here. I know that people of your religion are treated\nbadly by the Christians. Among my people all religions are equal. The\nUlang-Yassa, the law of Genghis Khan, commands it.\" When he spoke the\nname \"Genghis Khan\" there was a reverence in his voice, like a Christian\nspeaking of Jesus.\n\nShe was reminded of Tilia, telling her why it was better to be a harlot\nthan a wife. She wanted to weep with frustration, as if she had been\npounding her fists against a stone wall. How could a man who seemed\ncontent to have left his own homeland behind forever understand how\n_she_ felt?\n\n\"Usun, it does not matter to me that I am lowly here and might be great\nthere. This land is where I was born and grew up, and no matter how much\nI suffer here, it is my home. I do not want to live among Tartars and\nPersians. I would be so terribly alone. I beg you, do not try to uproot\nme from this land.\"\n\n\"You would not be alone,\" he said in a low, sad voice. \"You would have\nme.\"\n\n\"I could never be happy with you.\" It was a terrible thing to say, but\nonly the truth might make him change his mind.\n\nHe did not look at her. He drained his cup and thrust it at her as if\nstriking a blow.\n\n\"The flagon is empty,\" she said.\n\n\"I will go.\" He stood up and pulled his tunic on over his head. He was\nno taller than she was, but as she sat on the bed and stared up at him,\nhe seemed to loom over her like a giant. His black gaze was empty of\nfeeling as stone.\n\n\"It does not matter whether you are happy. You are mine and you will\ncome with me.\"\n\nShe shrank away from him, terrified. The face he showed her was the face\nof the man who had dragged her naked through that Orvieto street.\n\nShe threw herself full length on the bed, sobbing. Her heart felt ready\nto burst with anguish.\n\n_Oh, God, only You can help me. Send someone to deliver me, or I will\ndie._\n\n\n\n\nLXV\n\n\nPride swelled Daoud's heart as he watched the column of Muslim cavalry\nsuddenly change direction and sweep like a long roll of thunder through\nthe valley. A flutter of orange banners on their flanks, and the men at\nthe far end of the line launched into an all-out gallop, while the\nriders at the near end slowed to a high-stepping trot. The whole line\npivoted like a great scythe, enveloping the flank of an imaginary enemy.\n\n\"Very impressive,\" said King Manfred. \"They get their orders from those\ncolored flags?\" He and Daoud stood on the rounded brow of a grassy hill,\nwatching the Sons of the Falcon displaying their skills for their king.\nThe valley Daoud had found for the demonstration was a natural\namphitheater, a flat, circular plain at least a league in diameter\nsurrounded by hills. Normally it was used as grazing land.\n\nFor over a year Daoud had been training these two hundred men, picked\nfrom hundreds of volunteers from Manfred's Saracen guards. With so much\ntime, he had been able to forge and polish the Sons of the Falcon into a\nweapon that could be the vanguard of Manfred's army.\n\nHe hoped that what Manfred saw today would put him in a warlike mood, a\nmood to ask Daoud for his advice. He prayed for the chance to urge\nManfred not to wait for Charles d'Anjou to invade his kingdom, but to\nmarch north and attack Charles at once.\n\n_O God, open Manfred's mind._\n\nFor Manfred to delay the start of his war against Charles d'Anjou even\nthis long could well be disastrous. A year ago Manfred could have moved\nout from southern Italy and smashed Charles, as a man rises from his\ncouch and crosses the room to crush a mosquito. Sadly, like many a man\nwho sees a mosquito across the room, Manfred had chosen to remain on his\ncouch.\n\nAnd the mosquito was fast growing into a dragon.\n\nLorenzo Celino and Landgrave Erhard Barth, the grand marshal of\nManfred's army, stood on either side of Daoud and Manfred. Scipio stood\nbeside Celino, who rested his right hand on the dog's big head. Half a\ndozen nobles and officers of Manfred's court were gathered a short\ndistance away from the king and his three companions. Lower down the\nhillside, scudieros held the party's horses.\n\n\"Those flags would be useless at night,\" said Barth, speaking Italian\nwith a heavy accent, which Daoud knew to be that of Swabia, the German\nstate from which Manfred's family came. \"And they would be hard to see\non a rainy day.\" He was a broad-faced man with a snub nose. All of his\nupper front teeth were missing, which caused his upper lip to sink in\nand his lower lip to protrude, giving him a permanent pout.\n\nIrritated, Daoud spoke to Manfred rather than to Barth. \"There are many\nways to signal. Colored lanterns at night. Horns. Drums. These men have\nlearned all those kinds of signals and can respond to them quickly.\"\n\nDaoud's muscles tensed as he thought that the big German and he might\nhave it out today. Barth, he felt sure, was one of the advisers who was\nholding Manfred back.\n\n\"I like the idea of signals,\" said Manfred. \"In every battle I have\nseen, no one knows what is going on once the two sides meet. Our knights\ndo not know how to fight in unified groups as the Turks and the Tartars\ndo.\"\n\nThe Sons of the Falcon rode to the base of the hill from which Manfred\nwas reviewing. Omar, Daoud's black-bearded second in command, spurred\nhis horse up the slope, leapt from the saddle, and rushed forward to\nkneel and kiss Manfred's hand.\n\n\"You ride splendidly,\" said Manfred in Arabic.\n\n\"Tell the men I am very proud of them, Omar,\" Daoud said. Omar flashed\nbright white teeth at him.\n\nTo Manfred Daoud said, \"Now, Sire, if it be your pleasure, the Sons of\nthe Falcon will demonstrate their skill in casting the rumh--the lance.\"\n\nManfred nodded and waved a gauntleted hand. He was dressed in a long\nriding cloak of emerald velvet, with an unadorned green cap covering his\nlight blond hair. His only jewelry was the five-pointed silver star with\nits ruby center, which Daoud had never seen him without.\n\n_Just as I still wear the locket Blossoming Reed gave me._\n\nOmar bowed, and vaulted into the saddle with an agility that brought a\ngrunt of appreciation from Manfred. Waving his saber, he rode back down\nthe hill.\n\nA scaffold and swinging target for the lances had been set up halfway\nacross the valley. Recalling his own training--and Nicetas--Daoud\nwatched his riders form a great circle in the plain below them. He heard\nin his mind a boy's warbling battle cry, and felt a deep pang of\nsadness.\n\n\"Why do you call them the Sons of the Falcon, Daoud?\" Manfred asked.\n\n\"Because I know the falcon is the favorite bird of your family, Sire,\"\nDaoud said. Manfred grinned and nodded.\n\nHe thought, _And because the falcon does not hesitate_.\n\nDaoud admired Manfred. He was said to be the image of his father, and\nthat made it easy to see why Emperor Frederic had been known as \"the\nWonder of the World.\"\n\n_Easy to see why Sophia loved Manfred for a time._\n\nBut as a war leader, Manfred was frustrating to work with. He seemed to\nhave no plan for fighting Charles d'Anjou. All over southern Italy and\nSicily, knights and men-at-arms were in training and on the alert, but\ndays, months, seasons, followed one another and Manfred ordered no\naction.\n\nDaoud's own goal remained the same he had set for himself a year ago in\nOrvieto: To spur Manfred on to make war and to help him win a victory.\n\nAnd when the war gave an opportunity, Daoud would once again try to kill\nthe Tartar ambassadors. They were now, Manfred's agents in the north\nreported, in Rome under Charles's protection. Perhaps he could even\nrescue poor Rachel.\n\nDaoud smiled with pleasure as the riders below formed a huge circle, one\nman behind the other. He was able to recognize individual men he had\ncome to know over the past months--Muslims from Manfred's army whom he\nhad picked and trained himself--Abdulhak, Mujtaba, Nuwaihi, Tabari,\nAhmad, Said, and many others. They were as eager for this war to begin\nas he was.\n\nAt a shouted command from Omar, who sat on his horse in the center, the\ncircle began to rotate, the horses running faster and faster. Each man\nbalanced a lance in his right hand, and as he rode past the swinging\ntarget ring, he hurled it. The ring was pulled from side to side with\nlong ropes by attendants, just as when Daoud had trained as a Mameluke.\n\nAs lance after lance flew through the moving target, Manfred gave a low\nwhistle of appreciation. Daoud had ordered the ring to be a yard wide\nand the distance from horseman to target fifty feet. It was easier than\nit looked for men who had practiced for months, but the rapidity of it\nmade a beautiful spectacle. Daoud's eye caught a few misses, but he\ndoubted that Manfred noticed.\n\n\"Like falcons, swift and fierce and sure,\" said Manfred. \"But a bird is\njust bone and muscle and feathers, Daoud. These men are lightly armed\nand armored compared to Christian soldiers. These two hundred of yours\ncould never stop a charge of Frankish knights.\"\n\nDaoud tensed. This was an opening.\n\n\"True, Sire, when Frankish knights in all their mail get those huge\narmored war-horses going at a gallop, nothing can withstand them. But we\nMamelukes have defeated the Franks over and over again by not letting\nthem use their weight and power to advantage. They must close with their\nenemy. We fight from a distance, raining arrows down upon them. If the\nenemy pursues you, flee until he wearies himself and spreads his lines\nout. Then rush in and cut him to pieces. Attack the enemy when he is not\nexpecting it.\"\n\n\"That might do well enough in the deserts of Outremer,\" said Manfred,\n\"but European warfare is different. There are mountains and rivers and\nforests. We cannot spread out all over the landscape.\"\n\nDaoud threw an exasperated look at Lorenzo, whose dark eyes were\nsympathetic, but who shook his head slightly, as if to warn Daoud to be\npolitic in his argument with the king.\n\n\"There is one principle that you can adopt from Mameluke warfare,\" said\nDaoud, choosing not to contradict Manfred, \"and that is speed.\"\n\n\"Our Swabian knights and our Saracen warriors ride as swiftly as any in\nEurope,\" Barth growled.\n\n\"Once they get moving,\" said Lorenzo sharply.\n\n_He isn't always politic himself_, thought Daoud.\n\n\"Forgive me for speaking boldly, Sire,\" said Daoud, \"but a whole summer\nhas gone by since Pope Clement proclaimed a crusade against you and\ndeclared that your crown belongs to Charles d'Anjou. And there has been\nno fighting. Is this what you mean by European warfare? In the time it\ntakes Europeans to get ready for one war, we Mamelukes would have fought\nfive wars.\"\n\nAs he spoke he proudly recalled what an Arab poet had written of the\nMamelukes: _They charge like lightning and arrive like thunder._\n\nManfred turned to watch the riders. A royal privilege, Daoud thought, to\nconduct an argument at one's chosen pace. He pushed down the urge to say\nmore, forced himself to be patient, waited tensely for Manfred to reply\nin his own time.\n\nHe felt a movement beside him and turned to see that Lorenzo had moved\ncloser to him. He gave Lorenzo a pleading look, trying to ask him to\njoin the discussion. Manfred respected Lorenzo and listened to him.\n\nLorenzo replied with a frown and a nod. He seemed to be saying he would\nspeak up when he judged the moment right.\n\nWhen the men who had cast came around to the opposite side of the\ncircle, fresh lances thrust upright in the ground by their servants were\nwaiting for them. Each warrior leaned out of the saddle, seized a lance,\nand rode back around at top speed to throw at the target again.\n\nAfter a moment, Manfred turned back to Daoud and said, \"Charles d'Anjou\nhas been hanging about in Rome all through the spring and summer\nclaiming to be king of Sicily. This morning I asked to see my crown, and\nmy steward brought it to me from the vault. The pope's words had not\nmade it disappear. Rome is not Sicily. Anjou is welcome to stay in that\ndecaying pesthole until he takes one of those famous Roman fevers and\ndies.\"\n\nNo doubt, thought Daoud, Manfred's gesture in calling for his crown had\namused his whole court. And put heart into any who feared Charles's\ngrowing strength. Manfred was charming, no question. But meanwhile\nCharles d'Anjou, who by all accounts had not a bit of charm, _was_ in\nfact growing stronger day by day. Those of Manfred's supporters who were\nafraid had good reason, and Daoud was one of them.\n\nIt was agony to think how the opportunity to beat Charles now was\nslipping away.\n\n\"So, you will wait for Charles to come to you,\" said Daoud.\n\nManfred smiled. \"And he, I suspect, hopes that I will come to him.\nCharles has to pay his army to stay in Italy. The longer he puts off\nattacking me, the more his treasury is depleted. My army waits at home,\nsustaining itself.\"\n\nDaoud said, \"Now that Charles's war is called a crusade, barons and\nknights are joining him from all over Christendom. Many of them are\npaying their own way. Sire, when Charles decides he is ready to move\nagainst you, his strength will be overwhelming.\"\n\nLorenzo spoke up. \"And meanwhile the pope has placed your whole kingdom\nunder interdict. No sacraments. No Masses. Couples cannot marry in\nchurch. Can we weigh the pain of mothers and fathers who think their\nbabies that die unbaptized will never see God? And what about the terror\nof sinners unable to confess, and the dying who cannot have the last\nsacraments? And the grief of those who had to bury their loved ones\nwithout funerals? Sire, your people have not heard a church bell since\nlast May. They grow more restless and unhappy every day. And it does not\nhelp your cause when they see your Muslim and Jewish subjects freely\npracticing _their_ religions.\"\n\n\"I am surprised to hear _you_ pay such tribute to the power of religion,\nLorenzo,\" said Manfred with that bright grin of his.\n\nThe grim lines of Lorenzo's face were accentuated by the droop of his\nblack and white mustache. \"I have never in my life doubted the _power_\nof religion, Sire.\"\n\nHaving used up all their lances, the Sons of the Falcon were now\nshooting arrows from horseback, riding toward lines of stationary\ntargets that had been set up at the far end of the valley.\n\n\"Do you have a proposal, Daoud?\" said Manfred with a sour look. \"Let me\nhear it.\"\n\nDaoud felt an overwhelming sense of relief. This was the moment he had\nbeen hoping for all day.\n\n\"Sire, do not wait for Charles to come out of Rome,\" he said. \"In\nJanuary, February at the latest, assemble your army and march north.\"\n\nThere, he had made his cast. Would it pierce the target?\n\n\"I could go all the way to the Papal States only to find Charles lurking\nbehind the walls of Rome. I cannot besiege Rome. That would take ten\ntimes as many men as I have.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Daoud. \"His army will not let him stay in Rome. By the end of\nwinter they will have stolen everything in Rome that can be stolen.\nCharles will have to promise them more spoils and lead them to battle,\nor they will desert him.\"\n\nManfred nodded thoughtfully. \"In truth, greed is what drives them.\"\n\nDaoud added, \"And call on your allies in Florence and Siena and the\nother Ghibellino cities to stop any more of Charles's allies coming into\nItaly. They cannot all come by sea as he did. Many times I have heard\npeople in your court say that Charles has cut Italy in half. Nonsense.\nHe has put himself between two millstones.\"\n\nManfred's eyes lit up. \"Yes, I like that way of looking at it.\"\n\nThe Sons of the Falcon had ridden to the far end of the valley and were\nnow roaring back, standing in the saddle and firing arrows over the\ntails of their horses.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Daoud. \"Not to act is to act.\" He felt urgency building in\nhim as he sensed that he was persuading Manfred.\n\n\"I remember my father saying something like that,\" said Manfred. \"What\ndo you think, Erhard?\"\n\nDaoud's heart sank. The beefy Swabian would undoubtedly counsel more\nwaiting.\n\nIn thought, Landgrave Barth sucked in his upper lip and pushed out the\npendulous lower one until it seemed he was trying to pull his nose into\nhis mouth.\n\n\"Anjou will have to campaign against you soon, Sire, for the reason Herr\nDaoud has just given,\" he said slowly. \"His men will not allow him to\nstay in Rome and endure the privation of a siege. When they learn you\nare coming, they will demand that he march out to meet you. He is\nprobably planning an attack for next April or May, when the weather is\nbest. He must expect reinforcements--but, so he does not have to pay\nthem for long, he will not want them to come until the very moment he is\nready to invade. So, if you attack him in January or February, you catch\nhim unready.\" He finished with a vigorous nod of his head. \"I recommend\nit.\"\n\nDaoud felt a new and unexpected warmth toward Barth. The landgrave was\nnot such a dull-witted old soldier after all.\n\nThe Sons of the Falcon had finished their archery exercise. In four\nranks, fifty mounted men abreast, they drew up at the base of the hill\nand saluted Manfred, two hundred scimitars flashing in the afternoon\nsun.\n\nManfred stepped forward to the crest of the hill and raised his hands\nabove his head. \"_May God bless your arms!_\" he shouted in Arabic.\n\nThe wild, high-pitched ululations of his Muslim warriors echoed against\nthe surrounding hills as Manfred, smiling, returned to his companions.\n\nHe said, \"In three months' time, then. No more than four. The weather\nwill decide. I will call in my barons one by one and tell them to\nprepare. We must keep this a secret for as long as possible.\"\n\nDaoud, Lorenzo, and Barth all bowed in assent. Daoud felt a surge of\njoy. He had succeeded in persuading Manfred to strike at Charles.\nManfred's reasons for not wanting to move were sound ones, he knew. He\nhad spent long hours considering them himself, but he was certain that\nif Manfred did nothing, he was surely doomed. At this moment Manfred and\nCharles were nearly evenly matched, Manfred a little stronger, Charles\ngrowing in strength. To a great extent it would be luck--or the will of\nGod--that determined the outcome. Daoud could not control luck or God.\nBut he could make the best possible plan and give his all to it.\n\nSuddenly, he badly wanted to get back to Sophia in Lucera. Usually he\nenjoyed being out with the troops, overseeing their training. Today he\nbegrudged the time. Every moment seemed precious. Three months would be\ngone before he and Sophia realized it. Then he would be riding with\nManfred's army, perhaps never to see her again.\n\nHe must make sure she would be safe no matter what happened. Perhaps\nUgolini or Tilia could help. Sophia would want to travel with the\narmy--with him--north. She was not a woman to pine at home while men\nmarched away. He must discourage her; it was too dangerous.\n\nBut to discourage her would probably be impossible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSimon listened to the drumming hooves behind him on the dirt road and\nthought, _I will be hearing this sound all day long every day for\nmonths_. He supposed that after a while he would no longer notice it,\nbut today, the day after his departure from Ch\u00e2teau Gobignon, his ears\nseemed to ache from the incessant pounding.\n\nAnd the hoofbeats were a constant reminder that he was really leading\nthe Gobignon host to war.\n\nAll summer long the conviction had been growing upon him that this was a\nbad war, and all the suffering it caused, all the deaths and\nmutilations, would be on his conscience forever. No matter that the pope\nhad proclaimed it a holy crusade against the blasphemer Manfred. Popes\ncould be wrong about wars.\n\nSimon's father, Roland, had vividly described for him the horrors of the\nAlbigensian crusade of a generation ago, when knights of northern France\nhad fallen upon Languedoc like a pack of wolves--like Tartars, in\nfact--reducing it to ruins. And that crusade had been proclaimed by a\npope.\n\nIn days to come the rumbling in his ears would be louder, the feeling\nthat he was guilty of great wrongdoing harder to bear. He looked over\nhis shoulder and saw thirty knights mounted on their palfreys, another\ntwenty equerries and servants on smaller horses, two priests on mules,\nfive supply wagons, two of them full of weapons and armor, one hundred\nfoot soldiers and sixty great war-horses in strings, a page boy riding\nthe lead horse in each string. This was the Gobignon household\ncontingent. At today's end he would have three times that many of every\ncategory, and by the end of the week his army would have swollen to its\nfull size of four hundred knights, fifteen hundred foot soldiers, and\nall the equerries, attendants, horses, and baggage they needed.\n\nAnd, a year or more from now, how many of them would come back from this\nwar? He thought of Alain de Pirenne, lying on a street in Orvieto. He\nthought of Teodoro at the Monaldeschi palace, his chest crushed by a\nstone, his warm blood pouring out of his mouth over Simon's hand. How\nmany of these men would die miserably like that?\n\nThierry d'Hauteville and Valery de Pirenne--Alain's younger brother--the\ntwo young men who rode behind him, caught his eye and grinned\ndelightedly. He managed a smile in return, but feared it must look\nawfully weak. The bright red silk crosses sewn on their chests caught\nhis eye. He wore one, too, on the breast of his purple and gold surcoat.\nHis oldest sister, Isabelle, a fine seamstress, had sewn it there and\nembroidered the edges with gold thread.\n\nAll three of his sisters, Isabelle, Alix, and Blanche, had worked on the\ncrusaders' banner, red cross on white silk, that rippled above Simon.\nEquerries took turns riding with the banner according to a roster Simon\nhimself had written. Beside the crusading flag, another equerry carried\nthe banner of the house of Gobignon, three gold crowns, two side by side\nand one below them, on a purple background.\n\nHis sisters' three husbands rode to war behind him today. Since he was\nunmarried and had no heir, one of them would be Count de Gobignon if he\nshould fall.\n\n_And with more right to the title, perhaps, than I have_, he thought\nunhappily. And he felt as if icy fingers stroked the back of his neck\nwhen he thought how much one of those three knights back there stood to\ngain by his death.\n\nHis little troop raised no dust; the road was damp and covered with\npuddles from yesterday's rain. Thank God it had not rained hard enough\nto turn the road into mud. As it was, the weather made his leave-taking\ngloomier than it need have been. The empty fields, littered with yellow\nstubble, lay flat under the vast gray bowl of a cloudy November sky. The\nonly feature in that landscape was a darker gray, the bulk of Ch\u00e2teau\nGobignon with its round towers rising on its great solitary hill. The\nroad they traveled ran back to it as straight as if it had been drawn\nwith a mason's rule.\n\n_I should stop this enterprise now_, Simon thought. _I should turn back\nbefore it is too late._\n\nThe longer they were on the road, the harder it would be to declare\nsuddenly that Gobignon was _not_ going to war in Italy, to tell his\nbarons and knights to return to their homes and hang up their arms. If\nhe did so at this moment, he would provoke great anger in these men of\nhis own household. Today and tomorrow great barons would be joining him,\nmature men--his vassals--but men of weight and power in their own right.\nTheir scorn at his change of heart would be almost unbearable.\n\nBut did he want to be another Amalric de Gobignon, leading the flower of\nhis domain's manhood, hundreds of knights and thousands of men-at-arms,\nto war, with only a handful coming back? If this was a bad war, God\nmight well punish Charles d'Anjou with defeat. And Simon would share,\nnot in the glory as Charles had promised him, but in disaster and death.\n\n_And I am not rightfully the Count de Gobignon._\n\nHe knew, though these men did not, that he had no right to call them out\nto war. If Simon de Gobignon, a bastard and an impostor, led this army\nto its destruction, what name was there for such a crime?\n\nThe voice of Valery de Pirenne, Simon's new equerry, broke in on Simon's\ntormented thoughts.\n\n\"I am not sorry to be leaving home this time of year. What better place\nto spend the winter than sunny Italy?\"\n\n_I have already caused the death of this young man's brother. Will I\nkill Valery too?_\n\n\"It rains much in Italy in January,\" said Thierry, now Sire Thierry\nd'Hauteville, having been knighted by Simon at the beginning of November\non the Feast of All Saints. His tone was lofty with experience.\n\n\"Bad weather for war,\" said Henri de Puys, whose experience was ten\ntimes Thierry's--or Simon's, for that matter. \"But the rains should be\nover by the time we reach that infidel Manfred's kingdom.\"\n\n\"Look there,\" said Thierry. \"More knights coming to meet us.\"\n\nSimon saw a line of about a dozen men on horseback, three canvas-covered\nwagons and a straggling column of men on foot with spears over their\nshoulders. The oncoming knights and men were tiny in the distance,\nmarching along a road that would meet Simon's route.\n\n_Oh, God, now it will be harder to turn them back._\n\n\"That will be the party from Ch\u00e2teau la Durie,\" Thierry said, pointing\nto the horizon where the four towers of a small castle were just barely\nvisible.\n\nA distant bell was ringing out the noon hour as Simon's troop met those\nfrom la Durie. All of the new knights wore red crosses on their tunics.\nSire Antoine de la Durie was a stout man about de Puys's age with a huge\nmustache called an algernon, whose ends grew into his sideburns. Simon\nand de la Durie brought their horses together and embraced. The knight\nsmelled like a barn.\n\n\"How was your harvest, Sire Antoine?\"\n\nLarge white teeth flashed under the algernon. \"Ample, Monseigneur. But\nnot so ample, I trust, as what we shall gather in Sicily.\"\n\nThey all wanted this so much.\n\nHow his chief barons had cheered and roared and stamped when he\nannounced this war to them at his Midsummer's Eve feast in the great\nhall at Ch\u00e2teau Gobignon! It was at that very moment, when he had seen\nthe ferocious eagerness of his barons for war, that he had begun again\nto doubt.\n\nAntoine de la Durie gestured with a callused, bare hand to three young\nmen on horseback whose russet cloaks were patched, but whose longswords\nproclaimed their knighthood. They grinned shyly at Simon.\n\n\"These are the Pilchard brothers, Monseigneur. They are not Gobignon\nvassals, but they are Madame de la Durie's cousin's sons, and I vouch\nfor them. They beg to go crusading under your leadership.\"\n\n_Under my leadership! God help them!_\n\n\"You are right welcome, Messires. When we stop for the night, see my\nclerk, Friar Amos, and have him add your names to our roll.\"\n\nThe young men dismounted, rushed to him, and kissed his hands.\n\nWhy did he not send them away, send all these knights away, tell them\nthere would be no war in Italy? Because he was afraid of his own barons\nand knights, the men he was supposed to lead. Because he felt he had set\nsomething in motion that could not be stopped, like one of those\nhorrendous avalanches in the Alps.\n\nIf they were to keep going, he must--without mishap--cover ten leagues a\nday to reach Rome by February. He must study again the maps Valery was\ncarrying in his saddlebags, especially the one he had just received,\nalong with a letter, from Count Charles--King Charles.\n\nThe infidel Manfred, Charles had written, had stirred up the Ghibellino\ncities of northern Italy. They were lying in wait for allies of Anjou,\nwho might come down from France or the Holy Roman Empire. Simon must not\nwaste troops fighting the Sienese or Florentine militia. So he should\nenter Italy by way of Provence and Liguria, then cut across eastward to\nRavenna and thence down to Spoleto and Viterbo, and finally to Rome. The\nroundabout route would take longer, but Charles would expect Simon in\nRome by the first of February. Charles intended to march against Manfred\nat the beginning of April.\n\nTwo months to reach Provence, march along the Ligurian coast, perhaps as\nfar as Genoa, which was safely Guelfo, and then pick his way around the\nnests of northern Ghibellini to Rome. It could be done, but only if his\narmy met with no unexpected obstacles--a Ghibellino army, for instance,\nor a bad winter storm.\n\nAnd then, beyond Rome, what would they find?\n\nOnce they were there, at least he would not have to make the decisions\nthat determined the fate of these men. The responsibility--and the blame\nif they failed--would be Charles's.\n\n_The greatest war since you were a child_, Charles had promised.\n\nAnd none of the Gobignon men would ever know that they were fighting\nbecause he had fallen in love with a woman named Sophia--if that was\ntruly her name--and she had let him taste her love and then had\ndisappeared.\n\nHe remembered a trouvere at a feast singing of how the Greeks went to\nwar because Helen, wife of one of their kings, ran off with Paris,\nprince of Troy. But that was just a story.\n\nSophia--her face and form arose in his memory, and there was a strange\nhappiness mixed with the pain, as if he were glad of his suffering. He\nhad heard songs about the sweet pain of love, but he had never before\nnow understood them.\n\nAnd even now he could not think of Sophia as an enemy. His heartbeat\nquickened at the thought that there was a chance, very small but still a\nchance, that Sophia might truly be someone he could love, and that he\ncould free her from whatever entanglement had dragged her into Manfred's\npower.\n\nBy the end of the day the sound of hoofbeats around him was no longer a\ndrumming, but a thundering. And all around and above him was a\nfluttering of banners. Each of the larger contingents that joined him\nhad brought the standard of its seigneur.\n\nThe road south was climbing into forested hills. At the crest of the\nfirst hill Simon tugged on the reins to slow his palfrey, and turned to\nlook back. In the fading light of the overcast day, Ch\u00e2teau Gobignon was\na violet outcropping on the flat horizon, its towers indistinct. This\nwould be his last sight of it, perhaps for years. And tomorrow he would\ncross the boundary of his domain. That was a point past which there was\nno return. Once the host was assembled, once they had crossed the\nGobignon border, it would not matter what he told them. If he refused to\nlead them, they would find another leader.\n\nHe saw two more banners rising above the crest of a bare ridge to the\nwest. Then the heads and shoulders of men, then the horses they rode.\nThey waved and halloed. More followed them. And still more.\n\nSimon met the newcomers by a stream that trickled through a small valley\nlined with birch trees. Seigneur Claudius de Marion, the leader of the\nlarge new party, lifted his square chin as he reached over and clapped\nSimon heartily on the shoulder.\n\n\"The valley widens out up ahead,\" he said. \"I propose that we camp\nthere. The forest beyond is thick and not a good place to ride through\nat night. And, Monseigneur, to be frank, I do not want to send my\ndaughter home after dark.\"\n\n\"I will be quite safe, Father, if Monseigneur the Count wishes to press\non for the night.\"\n\nThe young woman riding a tall gray and white stallion beside Claudius de\nMarion had humorous blue eyes and a wide mouth. Her upper lip protruded\nslightly, an irregularity Simon thought quite pretty in her. She had not\ninherited her father's nose, which was shaped like an axe blade; hers\nwas small and turned up at the end. Her single yellow-gold braid, which\ncircled round from under her blue hood and hung down between her high\nbreasts, seemed to glow in the gathering dusk.\n\nSimon remembered dancing in a ring that included her at last Midsummer's\nEve feast. She had worn a woven wreath of white daisies in her hair.\n\n\"Barbara insisted on accompanying me to our meeting,\" said de Marion\nwith an indulgent grin. \"I could not persuade her to bid me farewell\nfrom our castle.\"\n\nBarbara's smile was wide and frank, like her father's. \"In truth,\nMonseigneur, I had to see all the knights and men you have gathered. I\nknew it would be a brave sight, such as I have never seen the like of.\nGod grant you a glorious victory. Will you take wine?\"\n\nShe held up an oval wineskin, and at Simon's nod and murmur of thanks\nshe worked her horse over to his with a click of her tongue and a pat on\nthe neck. She rode like one born to it, thought Simon. Which she was.\n\nShe squirted the wine into his open mouth. It was red and strong, and it\nlit a welcome little fire in his belly.\n\nAs they rode deeper into the valley, Simon asked himself, where had\nBarbara de Marion been when he had been earnestly searching for a wife?\nShe had been a child, and his eyes had passed right over her. How\ndifferent his life might have been if she had been a little older two\nyears ago. Seigneur Claudius was one of his chief vassals and a good\nfriend, and would doubtless have had no objection to a marriage. Simon\nmight never have gone to Italy.\n\nBut there was room in this heart for only one love. And there was only\none course his life could take now.\n\nSomehow, with the sight of this maiden and the realization that he might\nhave fallen in love with her once but never could now, a door closed in\nSimon's mind. His destiny lay in Italy. He could no more forget Sophia\nand return to Ch\u00e2teau Gobignon like a snail crawling into its shell than\nhe could spit himself on his own sword.\n\nAs for these men, they were going to Italy for their own gain, not to\nhelp Simon find Sophia, nor yet to help Charles d'Anjou become King of\nSicily. Or even to protect the pope from his Hohenstaufen enemies. He\nhad not had to appeal to their feudal obligations in summoning them to\nwar. As Count Charles had predicted, they all _wanted_ to come. All they\ncared about was a chance for riches and land and glory after years of\ndoing nothing but managing their domains. They marched of their own free\nwill. He only pointed the way.\n\nHe remembered something Roland had said to him: _Once you have made your\nchoice, put your whole heart and soul into it. Never divide yourself._\n\nWhich, Simon thought, was exactly why, even though he would pass near\nNicolette and Roland's home in Provence, he would not visit them. He\nknew well their feelings about crusades, and he could be quite sure of\nthe loathing with which they would view this war. Roland had even spent\na good part of his youth at the court of Emperor Frederic, Manfred's\nfather. No, he had enough doubts of his own without letting his parents\nadd more.\n\nEven so, from his belt hung Roland's gift to him, the jeweled Damascus\nscimitar. He did not like to admit to himself that he was superstitious,\nbut with this scimitar Roland had gotten out of Egypt alive in the face\nof the most terrible dangers. Somehow, Simon saw the scimitar as a\ntalisman that might also get him through this war.\n\nHe glanced over at the beautiful Barbara de Marion and felt a rush of\ngratitude. Knowing that, lovely as she was, she could never make him\nforget Sophia, had helped him make his decision.\n\n\n\n\nLXVI\n\n\n\"It has been four years since I mounted a horse and drew my bow in\nbattle,\" said John Chagan with a grin. \"A man grows old if he does not\nfight.\"\n\nRachel paused in her work of setting up their tent for the night to\nstare at him, wondering if he knew how unready for fighting he looked.\nThe pouches under his eyes were as prominent as his cheekbones, and the\ncheekbones themselves were criss-crossed with tiny red lines.\n\nIt had been nearly a month since he had taken his pleasure with her in\nbed. She was glad enough of that, but she felt sorry for him, even\nknowing that his death in battle would free her. The way his hands\ntrembled, he would be lucky to get an arrow nocked, much less shoot it\nat an enemy.\n\nThe tent flap was pushed aside, and a Venetian crossbowman backed in\nholding one end of Rachel's traveling chest. Another man followed at the\nother end.\n\n\"What have you got in here--marble blocks?\" the first archer grumbled as\nhe set the box down on the carpeted tent floor beside the bed.\n\n\"My helmet and sword and coat of mail,\" said Rachel with a smile. \"I\nwould not want to miss the battle.\"\n\nFear whispered to her that the armed men who traveled with the Tartars\nmust be aware that she had valuables in that chest. If any of them ever\ngot an opportunity, they would not hesitate to steal it from her. And\nstab her to death to get at it, if they had to. She hated carrying the\nheavy box everywhere. But even if she could have found a safe place for\nit in Rome, she had no way of knowing whether she could ever get back\nthere to claim it. The chest held her prisoner as much as John did.\n\nShe had thought that while she and John traveled with Charles d'Anjou's\narmy, she might be able to slip away. Perhaps if there was a battle, she\nmight escape in the confusion. But she could not do it alone, not if she\nwanted to take the chest.\n\n\"You can take my place if you are so eager,\" the second Venetian\nlaughed. \"I've seen battles enough.\"\n\n\"Where are we?\" she asked.\n\n\"Icerna. Still in papal territory.\"\n\n\"Where are we going?\" She heard a movement as she asked the question,\nand looked over at John. He was pouring himself a goblet of red wine\nwhile eyeing Rachel and the Venetians distrustfully. He had learned no\nItalian, and perhaps he thought she was flirting with the two archers.\n\n\"We are coming to a town called Benevento. Right on the Hohenstaufen\nborder. Supposed to be a papal city, but you never know. Border cities\nusually give their support to whoever is closer to them with the bigger\narmy. The rumor is that whether the town is Guelfo or Ghibellino, King\nCharles will let the troops have their way with Benevento. And high\ntime. How is a man to live on the miserable wages our would-be king\ndoles out to us?\"\n\n\"Enough of your damned complaining!\" a deep voice boomed. The flap of\nthe tent flew open, letting in a blast of chill air, and Cardinal de\nVerceuil strode in. Terror raced through Rachel. She quickly dropped a\nquilted blanket over the chest containing her treasure.\n\nDe Verceuil threw back the fur-trimmed hood of his heavy woolen cloak\nand, though his words had been for the Venetian archers, glared at\nRachel accusingly. She felt herself trembling. He was dressed in bright\nred, but like a soldier, not like a man of the Church. He wore a heavy\nleather vest over his scarlet tunic, and calf-high black leather boots.\n\n_God help me, what is he going to do to me?_\n\nSordello, the capitano of the Tartars' guards, followed the cardinal\ninto the tent. His lopsided grin was as frightening as the cardinal's\nangry stare. His eyes narrowed, and Rachel felt her face burn as he\nlooked her up and down.\n\n\"Out!\" Sordello snapped at the two Venetian crossbowmen. After they were\ngone, the tent flap opened still another time, and Friar Mathieu hobbled\nin, leaning on his walking stick.\n\n\"We do not need you,\" de Verceuil growled in his French-accented\nItalian.\n\n\"John needs me,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"To translate for him. And I think\nRachel needs me too.\"\n\n\"Stupid savage should have learned Italian by now,\" said Sordello.\n\n_Ah, you are very brave, capitano, insulting him in a language he does\nnot understand_, thought Rachel contemptuously.\n\nDe Verceuil glowered at Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"You cannot protect her.\"\n\n\"Protect me from what?\" Rachel's voice sounded in her own ears like a\nscream, and her heart was pounding against the walls of her chest.\n\n\"John can protect her,\" said Friar Mathieu, \"if he understands what is\nhappening.\"\n\nHe looked full into Rachel's face, and there was a warning in his old\nblue eyes. She was almost frantic with fear now. She had not been so\nfrightened since the day John and the rest of them had invaded Tilia's\nhouse and carried her off.\n\nWhat was Friar Mathieu trying to warn her about?\n\n\"What do you know of Sophia Orfali, Ugolini's so-called niece?\" de\nVerceuil demanded in his French-accented Italian.\n\n_Friar Mathieu has betrayed me!_\n\nRachel looked over at the old Franciscan and saw him close his eyes very\nslowly and deliberately and open them again. _Keep your mouth closed_,\nhe seemed to be trying to say to her. She had to trust him. She could\nnot believe he would say anything to turn de Verceuil against her.\n\n\"I--I know nothing,\" she said. \"Who is this you are asking about?\"\n\n\"What happens here?\" John asked Friar Mathieu in the Tartar language.\n\"Why are the high priest and this foot archer in my tent? I did not\ninvite them. Tell them I send them away.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu started to answer in the Tartar tongue. Rachel strained to\nhear him, but Sordello's ugly laughter overrode the friar's voice.\n\n\"I escorted Sophia Orfali to Tilia Caballo's brothel more than once,\"\nSordello said. \"And I know she was going to visit _you_ because I\noverheard her telling that to that devil David of Trebizond.\"\n\nSo it was Sordello, not Friar Mathieu, who had been talking to de\nVerceuil. She should have known.\n\nRachel heard Friar Mathieu now. \"I am talking to _you_, not to John,\" he\nsaid in the Tartar's tongue, and she understood that Friar Mathieu meant\nher. Neither de Verceuil nor Sordello understood the language of the\nTartars, or knew that she knew it. As long as Friar Mathieu did not\naddress Rachel by name and kept his eyes on John, who looked confused,\nit would appear that he was talking to the Tartar and not to Rachel.\n\nDe Verceuil strode over to the wine bottle standing on the low table by\nJohn's bed. Without asking permission, he picked it up and drank deeply\nfrom it.\n\n\"The Tartars travel with the best wine in this whole army,\" he declared.\n\"Better than the cheap swill King Charles carries with him.\" Sophia\nglanced at John and saw that he was glowering at de Verceuil.\n\nFriar Mathieu said in the Tartar tongue, \"Sordello went to the cardinal\nwith the story that you must be some sort of agent for Manfred and\ntherefore it is dangerous for John to keep you with him.\"\n\nWhy would Sordello do that now, Rachel wondered. He could have accused\nher anytime in the past year. She could not question Friar Mathieu,\nthough, without giving it away that he was talking to her. Did Sordello\nhave some plan to get the chest away from her and desert?\n\n\"They know hardly anything about you,\" Friar Mathieu said. \"Do not be\nafraid. Admit nothing. Deny everything. I think Sordello knows more\nabout Ugolini's household, and about Tilia Caballo's brothel, than is\nsafe for him to admit. Say nothing, and I believe they will frustrate\nthemselves.\"\n\nJohn smiled and nodded at Friar Mathieu. \"I see what you are doing,\" he\nsaid in Tartar.\n\nDe Verceuil was looming over her. \"Speak up! What was your connection\nwith Ugolini's niece? _Was_ she Ugolini's niece?\" Even though she was\nstanding up, he looked down on her from an enormous height. His deep\nvoice and great size terrified her.\n\nShe said, \"I know nothing about any cardinal or any cardinal's niece.\"\n\nDe Verceuil seized her by the shoulders, his fingers digging in so hard\nshe felt as if nails were being driven into her muscles. She was almost\ndizzy with panic.\n\n\"You lying little Jewess!\"\n\nSuddenly Rachel felt a violent shove, and she was thrown back against\nher quilt-covered chest and sat down on it hard. She looked up and saw\nthat John was standing before de Verceuil. It was he who had pushed them\napart. His arms were spread wide.\n\n\"Do not dare to touch her again!\" John shouted in the Tartar tongue. He\nturned to Friar Mathieu and jerked his head at de Verceuil.\n\n\"Tell him!\"\n\nWhen Friar Mathieu had repeated John's command, the cardinal answered,\n\"Tell Messer John that we have reason to believe that this Jewish whore\nis an agent of Manfred von Hohenstaufen, the enemy we are marching to\ndestroy. She met with Sophia Orfali, Ugolini's niece, and Ugolini and\nhis niece have both fled to Manfred. Manfred has tried before now to\nharm Messer John, and he could do it through this girl.\"\n\nJohn shrugged and glowered at de Verceuil when he heard this.\n\n\"Foolishness. Reicho does nothing but read books and comfort me. She has\nno friends, and no one comes to talk with her. Except you. Go away.\"\n\nDe Verceuil took another swallow from the wine jar.\n\n\"Put that down!\" John shouted. De Verceuil did not need to have that\ntranslated. He put the jar down, frowning at John, offended.\n\n\"Sordello is right,\" de Verceuil said. \"The man is a savage.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to tell him so?\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\nDe Verceuil replied to this with a haughty stare.\n\n\"Tell him this,\" he said. \"Tomorrow we march to Benevento. King Charles\nhas sent scouts and spies into Manfred's lands, and they have learned\nthat Manfred is moving in our direction with a large army. Larger than\nours, if the reports are to be believed. We would be stronger still if\nyour friend the pusillanimous Count de Gobignon were to put in an\nappearance.\"\n\nRachel remembered the Count de Gobignon, that tall, thin, sad-looking\nman who had so frightened her with his questions about Madonna Sophia.\n\nEveryone was asking questions about Madonna Sophia. There was no doubt\nthat Madonna Sophia and her friends had some secret. Rachel had always\nknown that, though she did not want to know what the secret was.\nWhatever it was, Rachel promised herself that no one would get a hint of\nit from her.\n\n\"Count Simon was reported coming down the east coast of Italy,\" said\nFriar Mathieu. \"He could have joined our army if King Charles had been\nable to wait for him in Rome.\"\n\n\"King Charles did not choose to wait in Rome,\" said de Verceuil.\n\n\"Oh, I think he did,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"I think he would have been\nhappy to stay in Rome if his supporters, such as his marshals and\nyourself, had not pressed him to move southward when you heard Manfred\nwas on the march.\"\n\n\"I did not know that you ragged Franciscans were experts on military\nstrategy,\" said de Verceuil.\n\n\"We are not. Indeed, war greatly grieves us. But we do possess common\nsense.\"\n\nWhat if there were a battle and Manfred won? Rachel thought. Would\nManfred's soldiers kill John? Would they treat her as one of the enemy?\nWould they rape her, steal her treasure? She had always hoped to escape\nto the kingdom of Sicily, and now she was in the camp of Sicily's\nenemies.\n\n\"Will there be a battle?\" she asked timidly of no one in particular.\n\nDe Verceuil's head swung around toward her. \"Do not worry about the\nbattle, little harlot,\" he said in an unpleasantly syrupy voice. \"Yes, I\nexpect we will be too busy tomorrow and the next day to concern\nourselves with you. After that, perhaps we will have some Ghibellino\nprisoners to help us find out what you have been up to. And you will\nfurnish our weary troops with diversion.\"\n\nRachel felt as if her body had turned into a block of ice. Was he saying\nthat he would let the troops have her? That would kill her. After\nsomething like that, she would want to be dead.\n\n\"Please--\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, diversion,\" said de Verceuil, reaching down to take her face\nbetween his hard, gloved fingers. \"It has been many a year now since I\nhave seen a Jew burn. And when you go up in flames, it will mark a new\nbeginning for this Sicilian kingdom of heretics, Jews, and Saracens. You\nwill be the first, but not the last.\"\n\nHe let go of her face just in time to avoid being pushed away by John.\nHe took a last swallow of wine and turned and strode out of the tent,\nfollowed by Sordello, who turned and gave Rachel a last leering,\ngap-toothed grin.\n\n\"Is that a great man among your people?\" John asked Friar Mathieu, his\nface black with rage. \"Among my people he would be sewn into a leather\nbag and thrown into the nearest river.\"\n\nRachel sat on her traveling box, her hand pressed between her breasts to\nquiet her pounding heart. She could hardly believe what she had heard,\nthat de Verceuil wanted to burn her at the stake as an agent of\nManfred's after the coming battle.\n\n_Oh, God, let Manfred win, please._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis name was Nuwaihi, and he was so young that his beard was still\nsparse. He came riding with his two companions out of the blue-gray\nhills to the north, and brought his pony to a skidding stop beside\nDaoud. He turned his mount and they rode on together, side by side, in\nManfred's vanguard.\n\n\"I saw the army of King Charles, effendi, I and Abdul and Said,\" he said\nin Arabic, gesturing to include his comrades. \"The Franks are on the\nroad that leads from Cassino to Benevento. They are about two days' ride\nfrom here. We hid behind boulders close to the road, and we counted\nthem. There are over eight hundred mounted warriors and five thousand\nmen on foot. They have many pack animals and wagons and merchants and\npriests and women following them. Just as our army does.\" His breath and\nthat of his pony steamed in the cold air.\n\nDaoud felt a prickling sensation rise on his neck and spread across his\nshoulders. Two days' ride. The armies could meet tomorrow. Tomorrow\nwould decide everything.\n\nNow, if only Manfred could conceive a plan for outmaneuvering Charles.\nIf only he would take Daoud's advice. He knew Europeans preferred to\nfight pitched battles, and he prayed that Manfred would not choose that\nway.\n\n\"Did you see a purple banner with three gold crowns?\" Daoud asked.\n\nTwo weeks ago a courier from the Ghibellini in northern Italy had\nbrought word that Simon de Gobignon's army had passed through Ravenna,\non the Adriatic coast. It seemed unlikely to Daoud that de Gobignon\nwould catch up with Charles in time to take part in the coming battle.\n\n\"No purple banner. They fly the white banner with the red cross.\"\nNuwaihi turned his head to the left and spat. \"And all the soldiers have\nred crosses on their tunics.\" He spat again. His fierceness pleased\nDaoud.\n\nAt one time, he thought, he would have been sorry to learn that Simon de\nGobignon was not with Charles's army. He would have longed to meet Simon\non the field and fight and kill him. But now he understood that he had\nhated Simon because Simon resembled the Christian David that he might\nhave been. It did not matter to him that he would not meet the French\ncount again. Instead, he could feel relieved that Charles would not have\nSimon's knights and men as part of his army.\n\nNuwaihi went on, \"Their Count Charles, he who would be king, was at the\nhead of the column. I knew him because he wears a crown on his helmet.\nHis banner is red with a black lion rearing up on its hind legs.\"\n\nDaoud looked over his shoulder and saw Manfred not far behind him, on a\nwhite horse with a black streak running from forehead to nose. The king\nof southern Italy and Sicily, in a cloak the color of springtime leaves,\nwas the center of a mounted group of his favorite courtiers. One\nstrummed a lute, and they were singing together in Latin.\n\n_A brave spectacle. Manfred rides into battle singing Latin sonnets._\n\nA Mameluke army on its way to war would have mullahs praying for victory\nand a mounted band playing martial music on kettledrums, trumpets, and\nhautboys.\n\nThe young blond men around Manfred, Daoud knew, were nimble dancers,\nwitty talkers, skilled musicians, and expert falconers. How well they\ncould fight he had yet to see. Manfred was the oldest of them, but right\nnow he looked as young as the others. He had on no visible armor, though\nDaoud knew he regularly wore a mail vest under his lime tunic.\n\nBehind Manfred, all on glossy palfreys and wearing mail shirts, rode his\nSwabian knights, Lorenzo Celino and Erhard Barth in the first rank. The\nSwabians' grandfathers had come to Sicily to serve the Hohenstaufens,\nand they still spoke German among themselves. Like their king, they wore\nno helmets, but most of them had fur-trimmed hoods drawn tight around\ntheir heads to protect them from the February wind. Above them fluttered\nthe yellow Hohenstaufen banner with its double-headed black eagle.\n\nThe column of knights, four abreast, stretched westward down this main\nroad. The lines of helmets and pennoned lances disappeared over the\ncrest of a pass cutting through the bleak mountain range that formed the\nrocky spine of Italy. Snow outlined the crevices in the rocks that\ntowered above the army of Sicily.\n\nManfred's host moved at a leisurely rate Daoud found typically European.\nThe march west, after they had assembled at Lucera, had taken two weeks.\nThe mounted warriors were held to the pace of the foot soldiers. Twice\nthe army had been struck by sleet storms that changed the road into a\nriver of mud. Rather than press on, as Baibars would have, Manfred had\nordered his army to halt and seek shelter in hillside forests.\n\nIn some of the valleys the army had been able to spread out and march\nbriskly over frozen fields and pastures. But then, along a mountainside\nor through a pass, the road would close down again, and the flow of\ntroops would slow to a trickle.\n\nDaoud turned back to Nuwaihi. \"Were you close enough to the road to see\nthe Tartars I told you of? Two small brown men with slanted eyes?\"\n\n\"Yes, effendi, they were riding near the head of the Franks. Just as you\ntold me, they had eight mounted men wearing red cloaks guarding them.\nAnd before and after them marched many men carrying crossbows.\"\n\n_Their people are such masters of war. How they will laugh at the\nidiotic way Christians fight each other._\n\nDaoud wondered whether the enemy army were mostly Frenchmen, or as\nmixed a host as Manfred's troops were. Manfred's thousand knights and\nfour thousand men-at-arms included Swabians, south Italians, Sicilians,\nand Muslims.\n\n_If only, instead of three scouts, we had three hundred men lying in\nambush along that road, we could have broken Charles's attack and\nperhaps killed him and the Tartars then and there._\n\nDaoud thanked Nuwaihi, Abdul, and Said and sent them to join the Sons of\nthe Falcon, riding today as the rear guard. He rode back to Manfred,\nhoping he could persuade the king and his commanders to use wisely the\ngreat army they had assembled.\n\nSoon Manfred, Erhard Barth, several of Manfred's German and Italian\ncommanders, Lorenzo, and Daoud were dismounted and gathered in a field\nbeside the line of march. Manfred's orderly had brought a map of the\nregion and spread it out on the ground, weighting the edges with rocks.\n\nAs Manfred crouched over the map, his five-pointed silver star with its\nruby center hung over a town, represented on the map by an archway and a\nchurch surrounded by a wall. The drawing was marked with the Latin name\n\"Beneventum.\"\n\n\"We can be in Benevento by nightfall,\" said Barth. \"And Anjou's army\nwill probably arrive at the same time. There is but one road they can\nfollow.\" He pointed to a brown line that ran down from a large oval, at\nthe top of the map, drawn around a collection of buildings and marked\n\"Roma.\" Between Rome and Benevento was a series of towns, each indicated\nby a drawing of one or two buildings surrounded by walls. Mountains were\nshown as rows of sharp little points.\n\n\"Benevento is a Guelfo town,\" said Manfred, \"and deserves to have us\nmove in on it and quarter our troops there. The town is at the end of a\nlong valley that runs north to south. The opening at the north end of\nthe valley is a narrow pass. Anjou's army must come through that pass.\nThey will find it easier to get into the valley than to get out, because\nwe will be waiting for them.\"\n\nDaoud felt a surge of exasperation, and quickly pushed it back down.\nAnger would not help him.\n\n\"Waiting for them?\" he said. \"If we are making war, we do not _want_ to\nmeet them.\"\n\nManfred frowned. \"If we drive them up against the north end of the\nvalley, we will have them trapped.\" Manfred smashed his fist into his\npalm. \"There will be nowhere for them to escape to.\"\n\n_He is getting tired of my giving advice that contradicts the way he\nthinks things should be done. After all, he did win battles before I\ncame here._\n\nBut to simply meet Charles's army face-to-face, like two bulls butting\nheads, seemed lunacy to Daoud.\n\n\"Such a battle will be bad for both sides,\" he said. \"We will butcher\neach other.\"\n\n_Perhaps I should have spent less time training my men and more trying\nto teach Manfred._\n\n\"We do outnumber them,\" said Manfred testily.\n\n\"And if every one of their men kills one of ours and every one of our\nmen kills one of theirs, there should be a few of our men left at the\nend of the battle. Do you call that a victory?\"\n\n\"Show some respect for your king!\" a Neapolitan officer snapped.\n\n\"No, be still, Signore Pasca,\" Manfred said to the Neapolitan. \"I want\nto hear Emir Daoud out. What can we do, except meet them and fight\nthem?\"\n\nDaoud remembered how he had wished that instead of scouts he had set men\nto ambush the Franks. He studied the map.\n\n\"Let us send men into the mountains around here and here.\" He ran his\nfinger over the angular shapes the mapmaker had drawn around Benevento.\n\"Then, when Charles's army is in the valley, we will fall upon it from\nboth sides and destroy it.\"\n\nNo one spoke for a moment. The younger Swabian officers were looking at\nhim with mingled horror and disgust. Manfred stared at the map with\nembarrassed intensity.\n\nErhard Barth broke the silence. \"Such an ambush would not be according\nto the customs of chivalry, Herr Daoud. Even if we were to win the\nbattle in such a fashion, the victory would bring us so much infamy that\nit would be better had we lost.\"\n\n\"We are not in Outremer, thank God,\" said a Swabian with a long scar on\nhis cheek.\n\n\"And we are not Saracens,\" said the one called Pasca. \"Most of us.\"\n\n\"In other words, our noble commanders would refuse to fight?\" said\nLorenzo, glaring angrily at the other officers.\n\nHow would Baibars deal with these men, Daoud wondered. He might cut off\na head or two and lavish gold and jewels and robes of honor on the rest.\nBut Daoud had placed himself under Manfred's orders. And Manfred's army\nwas not disciplined as Islamic armies were. European armies were made up\nof bands of warriors led by men who might or might not choose to take\norders from their overlord.\n\n\"You cannot turn my men into Saracens,\" said Manfred firmly. \"Even my\nSaracens fight like Europeans, because they have lived in Sicily for\ngenerations. You have trained two hundred men in your Mameluke methods\nof fighting, and I have seen that they are a brilliant unit, but you\nwould need many years to teach your ways to thousands of knights and\nmen. And I must give my Germans and Italians a plan that will be\nacceptable to them.\"\n\nErhard Barth's mouth drew down in an apologetic grimace. \"It is the way\nwe are used to fighting, Herr Daoud.\"\n\nIt was infuriating. Daoud felt rage burst in him like Greek Fire. With a\nsilent inward struggle, he brought it under control. For good or ill,\nhis destiny was bound to Manfred's.\n\nWhen the conference ended, Daoud's horse picked its way among the shrubs\nand rocks beside the road, retracing the line of march back to the\nsupply caravan. Daoud felt a powerful need to spend a few moments with\nSophia. She had insisted on coming with him. He had wanted her to stay\nout of danger. Now, tormented by misgivings about the coming battle, he\nfeared for her even more. But nothing now could spare them from\ntomorrow's peril and it lifted his heart to know that she was here.\n\n\n\n\nLXVII\n\n\nDaoud woke to a discreet scratching on the curtains of his bed.\nSomewhere in the street a drum was beating, sounding farther, then\nnearer again, as the drummer marched up and down the streets of\nBenevento, waking the fighting men quartered there.\n\n\"I am awake,\" he rasped.\n\n\"May God look with favor on your deeds this day, my lord,\" came the\nvoice of his orderly, Husain, through the heavy curtains.\n\nSophia's back was warm against his chest. His left arm, on which she had\nbeen sleeping, was numb. She wriggled her shoulders and then turned over\nto face him. He freed his arm and rubbed his face against hers, his\nbeard brushing her cheek.\n\nShe wrapped one arm around him and twined her legs around one of his.\nHer free hand moved down, fondling him. His hands glided over her body,\ntrying to memorize the feel of her. She murmured with pleasure into his\near.\n\nShe opened her eyes suddenly. \"Will it be bad for you to do this with\nme?\"\n\n\"What to do you mean, bad?\"\n\n\"Deprive you of strength for the battle?\"\n\nHe chuckled softly. \"If you made me stop now, I would be filled with\nsuch a rage that I would slay all of Charles's army single-handed.\"\n\nHer hand stopped pleasuring him. \"That would be good. Then we must\nstop.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I would rather go into battle with a beautiful memory\nand a clear head. As for my strength, God will restore it moments after\nI spend it. He always has, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Then let us not wait.\" She pulled him over on top of her and accepted\nhim into herself, tightening around him. A flood of breathless Greek\nendearments filled his ear.\n\nHe had never been with a woman who cried out as Sophia did during the\nact of love. Try as she might to muffle her sounds, she was certain in\nthe final surge to lose control. He was sure Manfred's other officers\nquartered in this house must hear her.\n\nWell, let them hear her, and envy him.\n\nShe let him rest upon her, happily released, until his body withdrew\nitself from her.\n\nA shadow crossed his mind.\n\n_That may have been the last time for us._\n\nThey lay side by side. A faint light penetrated the bed curtains from\nsomewhere in their room, and by that light he could see her smiling. He\nsmiled back, but his body was growing tense. Fear of what he would face\nin the hours to come was building inside him.\n\nThe face he loved, the warmth of her body so close to his, made him wish\nhe need never leave this bed. His arms and legs felt heavy, rebellious.\nIf he commanded them to move away from her, they would not.\n\n_In truth, I would have to be mad to want to go out and butcher infidels\nrather than stay here with Sophia._\n\nBut he could not stay with her. Today would decide everything. He forced\nhis reluctant limbs to push him away from her. She did not try to hold\nhim.\n\nOutside the heavy bed curtains, the air in the room felt cold as death.\n\nStanding alone in the middle of the floor, he felt a sickening void of\napprehension in his belly. As Sheikh Saadi had taught him, he faced his\nfear. He was terrified of death and defeat. Probably there had never\nbeen a warrior anywhere in the world who had not felt this way on the\nmorning of a battle. Probably the Prophet himself, before battle, had\nfeared for himself and for those he loved.\n\n_I cannot control today's outcome, for myself or for the men I fight\nbeside. But I can dedicate my mind and heart and will and limbs to God.\nI can fight for Him to the uttermost of my strength. Passive toward God,\nactive toward the world._\n\nNaked, he walked to the door leading to the balcony and pushed it\npartway open. A draft of even chillier air made his skin prickle and\nfluttered the flame of the candle Husain had lit when he woke them. The\nsky was still black and full of stars. Dawn was a long way off.\n\nHe was on the third story of this house in Benevento and could see over\nthe roofs of most of the surrounding houses. Men hurried through the\nstreets swinging lanterns. The drum was still beating a rapid tattoo in\nthe near distance, joined now by horses' hooves clattering on the\ncobblestones. Here and there a candle glowed behind shutters. Far away,\nprobably in the main camp of Manfred's army, north of town, a trumpet\ncalled.\n\nHe shivered, and closed the shutter against the winter wind.\n\nSophia had pushed the bed curtains aside and was sitting on the edge of\nthe bed with a blanket wrapped around her, watching him.\n\nOn the bedroom table, Husain had carefully laid out a pitcher and basin\nand Daoud's underclothes. Daoud took the tawidh by its thong and tied it\naround his neck. Next he picked up the silver locket and turned the\nlittle screw that opened it.\n\nThe magic was still working.\n\nBut when he looked into the locket, he saw the same face that was\nlooking at him from across the room. A feeling of happy relief filled\nhim, driving out the foreboding that had darkened his mind earlier in\nbed with Sophia.\n\nHe was sure now that whatever connection the locket had with Blossoming\nReed was lost. Love had changed the image. He had been testing it ever\nsince he arrived at Lucera, and it always showed him Sophia's face. He\ncould hope that whatever spell Blossoming Reed had placed upon it, when\nshe warned him, _your love will destroy both her and you_, was now\nbroken. He closed the locket and set it down on the table.\n\nHe had said good-bye in his heart to Blossoming Reed sometime during\nthese years in the land of the infidel. He had loved Blossoming Reed,\nbut he had never known love in all its fullness and completion until\nSophia. And, knowing that he had violated the one commandment Blossoming\nReed had laid upon him, and carrying her threat in the back of his mind,\nhis love for her had withered. She was still as vivid in his mind's eye\nas she had been in the locket before Sophia supplanted her. But his\nfeeling for her now was one of sad renunciation. Whether or not he\nsurvived this war, they must be forever parted.\n\nHe filled the earthenware basin with water from the wooden pitcher and\nbegan a ritual washing, first his hands, then his face, then forearms\nfrom wrists to elbows, then his feet up to the ankles.\n\n\"How can you stand the cold?\" Sophia said.\n\nDaoud shrugged. \"I have to.\" He did not want to talk now. He wanted to\nempty his mind for prayer. He tied the drawstring of his braies. Then he\npulled on red silk trousers, flaring below the knee and tight at the\nankles, and drew a cotton shirt over his head.\n\nHe went to the balcony again to check his directions. There was Venus.\nThat was east, then. He took a small rolled-up carpet out of his\ntraveling chest and laid it over the rug on the bedroom floor. He\noriented the prayer carpet toward the southeast and stood at the end of\nit.\n\nHe began the salat, bringing his hands up to the sides of his head and\nsaying, \"Allahu akbar, God is great.\"\n\nHe repeated his prayers, the bowing, the kneeling, the prostrations,\nwith great care and full attention. With his forehead pressed to the\nrug, he submitted himself and this day utterly to the will of God.\n\nFinished, he looked over at Sophia. She was still sitting on the edge of\nthe bed, watching him silently. He looked long at her, drinking her in.\nIt weighed heavily on his heart that he had to leave her, and even more\nheavily that she would be terribly frightened for him until he came\nback.\n\nAs he feared for her.\n\n_Compassionate God, Cherisher of Worlds, protect her._\n\nHe began to dress for battle.\n\nHusain had spread out his armor and weapons on top of his traveling\nchest. Daoud's breastplate was made of many rectangular pieces of steel\nlaced together with leather thongs and overlapping each other. Two\nlarger plates, side by side, were attached over his heart, inlaid with\nthe spiraling gold design that marked him a member of the halkha, the\nsultan's personal guard. Worked into the design were verses from the\nKoran. On the left plate, \"He succeeds who purifies the soul,\" and on\nthe right, \"And he fails who corrupts it.\" The breastplate was divided\nat the sides, where it could be strapped together. Baibars himself,\nafter Daoud returned to Manfred, had arranged for a bribed Genoese sea\ncaptain to smuggle it to him. Daoud was proud of it, and the men of the\nSons of the Falcon would be proud to see their leader wearing it.\n\nHe pulled on a quilted tunic of embroidered red silk, its padding\nstuffed with linen. Then he dropped the breastplate over his head. He\nheard a movement behind him, and then felt Sophia fastening the\nbreastplate at his sides.\n\nThe storehouse of Manfred's Muslim armorers offered blades of the finest\nHindustan steel, and from it Daoud had selected a saif for himself. It\ngleamed in the candlelight as he drew it from its sheath. He examined\nwith pleasure the gold inlay near the hilt. There was not a nick or a\nscratch anywhere on the blade. He took a heavy silk scarf from the\nclothing on the table and tossed it in the air. He held the blade under\nit, edge up. The scarf fell on the blade and then dropped to the floor\nin two parts.\n\nHe sheathed the sword and buckled it on. He put on his bayda, his\negg-shaped helmet, and wrapped the silk of his turban around and around\nit, and when it was properly tied, pinned it with an emerald clasp.\n\n\"Someday you must do that slowly for me, so I can learn how to wrap your\nturban,\" said Sophia. \"I would like to do that for you.\" A pang of\nsorrow for her struck his heart as he realized she was speaking of their\nfuture together to convince herself that there would be one. He wished\nhe could free her from fear.\n\nWhile he dressed, she had quietly been dressing, too, in a long blue\ngown and a fiery orange woolen mantle.\n\nHe looked down at the weapons laid out on the chest, selected a dagger,\nand stuck it in his belt. Next to the dagger lay the Scorpion, the tiny\ncrossbow, assembled, with a box of finger-length darts beside it. Surely\nnot a weapon for a battle, he thought.\n\n\"Here.\" He turned to Sophia and handed her the crossbow. \"I know you\nhave a dagger, but you can use this to protect yourself too. Sometimes I\ncoat the darts with a drug that makes a man unconscious, sometimes with\ndeadly poison. These darts are poisoned--be very careful with them. Most\npeople have never seen a weapon like this, so it will surprise them. And\nyou do not have to get close to your enemy to use it.\"\n\n\"I do not need protection,\" said Sophia. \"You will be out there\nprotecting me.\"\n\n\"If you take it, it will put my mind at ease,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"For that reason only,\" said Sophia, dropping the tiny crossbow and the\nbox of darts into a leather bag on top of her own traveling chest.\n\nDaoud picked up the locket. Its hammered silver outer surface glowed\nsoftly in the candlelight.\n\n\"Please take this too,\" he said. \"You have seen me wear it many times.\nAfter I have left you today, open it. I believe you will see a\npicture--an image--of me.\"\n\nShe lowered her head and rested her hands on his armored chest as he\nhung the locket on its silver chain around her neck.\n\nHe unfolded his forest-green linen cape and draped it over himself,\nclasping it at his throat with a gold chain.\n\nHe took her in his arms, carefully, so as not to hurt her with the steel\nbreastplate, and pressed his lips against hers for a long time.\n\nA knock at the door broke their kiss. \"My lord, your horse is ready,\"\nsaid Husain's voice.\n\nAt the door of the house, Ugolini and Tilia, both of them heavily\ncloaked against the cold night air, were waiting for them. In the light\nof the single small oil lamp burning beside the doorway, they were two\nshort, bulky shadows, Tilia much bulkier than Ugolini.\n\n\"We heard you moving about,\" said Tilia. \"We came down to wish you\nvictory.\"\n\n\"What do the stars say about today?\" Daoud asked Ugolini.\n\n\"Yesterday, the twenty-first of February, the sun moved from the house\nof Aquarius the water-bearer to the house of Pisces, the fish.\" Ugolini\nshook his head dolefully. \"The fish is the sign of Christendom.\"\n\n\"Adelberto, you are a poor astrologer,\" said Tilia heartily. \"A good\nastrologer would find something encouraging to say. For example: It\nwould not be good for Christendom for Charles to win. The French would\ndominate the Church and corrupt it. True Christianity will triumph if\nManfred wins.\"\n\n\"Do not use the word 'if,' Madama Tilia,\" said Daoud with a smile.\n\n\"I know Manfred is going to win,\" said Ugolini. \"Otherwise I would not\nhave followed his army all the way to Benevento. I believe he will go on\nto the Papal States and will persuade Pope Clement to restore me to my\nrightful position.\"\n\n\"If Pope Clement _waits_ for Manfred after Charles is defeated,\" said\nTilia dryly.\n\nThat was Ugolini's explanation of why he had come north with Manfred's\narmy. Daoud wondered what Tilia's was. Both risked being imprisoned and\nprobably executed should Manfred lose and Charles capture them.\n\n\"Did you see Lorenzo leave?\"\n\n\"Moments before you came down,\" said Tilia. \"That big dog of his,\nScipio, is inconsolable. I can hear him keening in the stable. I think\nAdelberto and I will take him up to our room and comfort him.\"\n\nDaoud said, \"It is a rare moment when Scipio is not at Lorenzo's side.\nAnd I think, too, he can sense when his master is in danger. As we all\nare today. It would be kind of you to care for him.\"\n\nWith a tremulous attempt at laughter, Sophia said, \"And who will care\nfor me?\"\n\nTilia laid her small hand on Sophia's arm. \"We will stay with you,\nSophia, if you want, until Daoud returns.\" She pulled Ugolini inside the\ndoor and it closed behind them, leaving Daoud and Sophia alone.\n\nSophia moved close in the lamplight outside the entrance of the\nmerchant's house and looked up at him, her eyes large and solemn.\n\"Nothing but you matters to me. Come back to me.\"\n\nDaoud still wished he could convince her that she had nothing to fear.\nBut that was foolish. She knew all too well that there was much to fear.\n\n\"I don't want you to be frightened,\" he said.\n\n\"I will try not to be.\"\n\n\"I will come back.\" There was so much he wanted to tell her, so much he\nrealized now he had not said about how he loved her as he had never\nloved another woman in his life since--\n\nSince his mother.\n\nThey were two people who had been utterly alone in the world, who had\nboth lost everyone precious to them. All they truly had was each other.\n\n_Oh, God, let me come back to her. I ask this not for my happiness, but\nfor hers._\n\n\"I know I will see you again.\" She smiled suddenly. \"Can you find your\nway to me?\"\n\nHe looked up at the building and then at the street. Bulking large\nagainst the stars was the huge square shape of an arch, which had been\nbuilt over a thousand years ago, he was told, by a Roman general to\ncommemorate his conquest of Jerusalem.\n\nWith this talk of stars and portents, he felt it must mean something\nthat this victory arch should be here in Benevento. Were not these wars\nof Muslim and Christian that had shaped his destiny wars over Jerusalem?\n\nHe said, \"I will ride through that arch, and you will be on the third\nfloor of the house with the carving over the door of San Giorgio slaying\nthe dragon.\"\n\nShe smiled, her teeth white in the lantern light. \"That is the Archangel\nMichael overcoming Satan.\"\n\n\"How am I to tell one Christian idol from another?\"\n\nShe pushed at him. He saw the tracks of tears glistening on her cheeks.\nHis own eyes burned.\n\n\"Go quickly now.\"\n\nHe turned, fearing the sight of his tears might break her heart, as hers\nhad broken his. He set his foot in the stirrup and vaulted into the\nsaddle of the brown Arabian Husain was holding. He waited for Husain to\nmount his own horse and then started down the street. He kept his face\nset toward the triumphal arch. He dared not look back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn her room, Sophia went through her chest and found her icon of Saint\nSimon Stylites. She kept the icon hidden when Daoud was around. He\nbelieved that praying to saints' images was idolatry, and she especially\ndid not want him to see her praying to a saint named Simon. She knelt,\nclasped her hands, and prayed to the desert saint.\n\n_Oh, holy Simon, bring him back to me. You who dwelt in the desert, you\nwho know what it is to be alone on your pillar, keep safe this man who\ncame alone out of the desert. Protect him from the swords and spears and\narrows of his enemies. He is not of our faith, I know, but I love him\nso, and is not Love another name for God?_\n\nShe pressed both hands flat against her belly and doubled over, weeping.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud had just ridden through the northern gate of the town when he\nheard his name called from above. He saw a pale blond head, gleaming in\nthe first rays of sunrise, looking down at him through the battlements\nof a square gate tower.\n\n\"Up here, Daoud, come up!\" Manfred's voice.\n\n\"This is the best vantage point we could ask for,\" Manfred said when\nDaoud arrived on the tower platform. \"Unless we were to climb those\nmountains over there.\"\n\nLorenzo was on the tower roof with Manfred, and Landgrave Barth, and six\nor so of Manfred's blond young noblemen, all in splendid cloaks of\npeacock blue, sunset orange, and blood-red. They wore glossy silk\nsurcoats over mail that covered them from chin to fingertips. Manfred\nwas in mail, covered by a knee-length yellow and black surcoat. He held\nhis bronzed helmet, decorated with three nodding ostrich plumes dyed\nemerald green, tucked under his arm.\n\n\"Have they come?\" Daoud asked.\n\nManfred nodded, his face sterner than Daoud had ever seen it. \"Anjou is\nin the valley.\"\n\nDaoud looked out from the tower. Like a field of wildflowers, hundreds\nof their own multicolored tents, each one tall and pointed at the top,\nspread out over the rolling brown landscape just beyond the town wall.\nIn front of the tents the divisions of Manfred's army were forming up in\nsquares. The faint notes of a military band came to Daoud's ear. It was\nEuropean music, which sounded jagged, harsh, and disconnected to him.\n\nHe saw the Sons of the Falcon now, over on the left, their rows\nstraight, sitting quietly on their horses, moving little. They all wore\nred turbans wrapped around their helmets; he had insisted that they\ndress alike so as to be easily recognizable. They, too, had their band,\na dozen men who played kettledrums, trumpets, hautboys, and cymbals from\nhorseback. The band was silent now, but would play when the Sons of the\nFalcon rode into battle.\n\n\"Long ago the Romans called this town Maleventum, bad wind,\" said\nManfred beside him, \"because they believed that the winds from the north\nbrought pestilence down from the swamps around Rome.\"\n\nJust the sort of thing Manfred would know, Daoud thought.\n\n\"Even though the people who live here chose a more attractive name,\"\nManfred went on, \"we see that the ancients were not wrong. Look what\nplague the wind has blown down from Rome today.\"\n\nDaoud's eyes followed Manfred's pointing arm to the narrow north end of\nthe long valley in which Benevento lay. The road from Rome entered the\nvalley at the north end and ran through it to the gate above which they\nwere standing. Rows of tents filled the northern opening of the valley,\nand the tiny figures of horsemen and foot soldiers were forming dark\nlines across the light brown fields.\n\nLast night peasants from that end of the valley had come flocking into\nBenevento with cartloads of possessions and stored crops. Even though\nthey were supposedly supporters of the papal cause, the people who lived\naround Benevento felt safer under Manfred's protection.\n\nBut this valley was a stone coffin, Daoud thought. Hills on either side,\nsqueezing together at the top of the valley, the town lying across the\nbottom end. In this box, how could he use the Sons of the Falcon well?\nHe pummeled his brain.\n\nOne thing he could at least achieve. He remembered Nuwaihi's report that\nthe Tartars were with Charles's army. He turned to Lorenzo.\n\n\"It falls to you to finish the Tartars. Make your way into Charles's\ncamp while the battle is on.\"\n\nLorenzo's mouth turned down under his thick mustache. \"It will take\ntime. I can take a wagon and go around through the hills and pretend to\nbe a peasant offering to sell wine and food to Anjou's people.\"\n\n\"Take some men with you.\"\n\nLorenzo shook his head. \"That would arouse suspicion. If I go alone,\nwhoever is guarding Charles's camp will see no reason to fear me.\"\n\n\"I went alone into the Palazzo Monaldeschi to kill them, and I could not\ndo it.\"\n\n\"And I, with my poor Sicilian skills, cannot be expected to succeed\nwhere Daoud ibn Abdallah, who was trained by the Old Man of the Mountain\nhimself, failed. Is that what you are thinking?\"\n\nDaoud smiled ruefully. \"Well--\"\n\nLorenzo frowned at him ferociously. \"You have given me the task. Let me\ncarry it out as best I can.\"\n\nDaoud gripped his arm, feeling muscle like oak. \"Go with God, my\nbrother.\"\n\n\"May your Allah bless your struggle today, Daoud.\" One last, long look\nfrom the dark brown eyes, and Lorenzo turned away.\n\nAgain, as he had with Sophia, Daoud felt anguish that he had not told\nLorenzo enough of his gratitude, his respect, his love.\n\n_And if Lorenzo dies an unbeliever, I will not meet him in paradise._\n\nManfred was standing at the battlements, staring north at his enemies,\nlooking, it seemed to Daoud, more sad than angry.\n\n\"Sire,\" Daoud said, \"I know what you plan for today's battle. But I beg\nthe favor of one change. Let the Sons of the Falcon be the first of your\nwarriors to strike at your enemies.\"\n\nManfred turned toward Daoud, and as he did the melancholy vanished from\nhis face. He looked cheerful and spoke briskly.\n\n\"Let us review the plan. My heaviest cavalry, the Swabian knights, will\nhit them first. The Swabians will try to break the enemy and drive them\nback up the field. Our foot archers will form up before Benevento and\nprotect it from any Frenchmen who might evade our cavalry charge.\nDaoud's Sons of the Falcon will ride in column up the west side of the\nvalley, turn, cut the French knights off from _their_ foot soldiers, and\nattack them from the rear.\"\n\nErhard Barth nodded. \"Excellent, Sire. But, if I may, Herr Daoud has a\ngood suggestion. We have seen the skill of his archers and lancers. Let\nthem lead the way, forming a screen for us. Let them fill the air with\narrows. The French will falter. Then the Sons of the Falcon will move\nout of the way.\" He spread his big, square hands apart to show how the\nSons of the Falcon would part to left and right. \"And we will hit them\nwith a wedge.\"\n\nA better plan, Daoud thought. He had underestimated Barth. And perhaps\nthe king he served.\n\nManfred nodded. \"Go to your men, Daoud. You will have my orders\nshortly.\"\n\nLooking into the faces of the two hundred men he had picked and trained\nover the past year, Daoud felt a great weight on his chest. He could\neven read the expressions of some in the front. Mujtaba, earnest. Ahmad,\nfierce. Omar, determined. Nuwaihi, who had first sighted Charles's army,\neager. It was frightful enough to face one's own death in battle, but to\nknow that he was leading to their deaths men he knew and loved--the\nburden was great. These men were like his children, and they would\nfollow him to destruction, and he wished before God that he did not have\nto think about that.\n\nGathered in a semicircle, the Sons of the Falcon listened silently as\nDaoud spoke to them from horseback. He made his voice big, so that it\nechoed from the walls of Benevento, behind his men.\n\n\"You are fighting not only to help King Manfred keep his throne,\" Daoud\nshouted. \"Not only to protect the kingdom of Sicily from conquest by\nthese greedy foreigners.\"\n\nThat was ironic, in a way, because, to be sure, the Hohenstaufens were\nnot native Sicilians. Nor were these Muslims. But both they and the\nHohenstaufens had lived in Sicily for generations, and surely that gave\nthem more right to rule here than the French.\n\n\"You are fighting for Islam!\" he cried. Their wild cheering rang in his\nears.\n\n\"You are fighting that you and your families may profess the faith and\nlive by the faith. This right, your wise rulers of the house of\nHohenstaufen have granted you. But if Charles d'Anjou rules this land,\nyour mosques will be turned into churches, your mullahs will be hanged,\nyour Korans will be burned, and your children's children will never hear\nthe sweet words of the Prophet, may God commend and salute him. They\nwill be raised as Christians and will never know they were anything\nelse. For us this war is jihad! Holy war!\"\n\nThe waves of their cheering swept over him, and their scimitars flashed\nin the rising sun. He had told them the truth, but there was an even\ngreater truth he had not told them. They were fighting, not just for\nIslam in Sicily, but for Islam everywhere. If Manfred won this battle,\nit would end, for this generation at least, the threat of Christians and\nTartars uniting to destroy Islam. But how to explain that in these few\nremaining moments? Enough that they knew that they were fighting for the\nfaith in their own land.\n\nSeeing their eagerness, he felt proud of them, and proud of himself. The\nweight of sadness he had felt when he first faced them was lifted, and\nhis heart beat strong within him.\n\nThe cheering faded quickly, replaced by a murmuring. Men were pointing\npast him. A faint rumbling came to his ears.\n\nAt the north end of the valley a long line of horsemen was moving\nforward, bright banners fluttering above them, and creamy clouds of dust\nbillowing up behind them.\n\nBarth rode up to him, his eyes bright, his thick lower lip curving\nupward in a smile. \"King Manfred has agreed to let you attack first. The\nSwabian knights are now ready. We will be behind you. Slow their charge,\nand then we will smash them.\" He struck a mailed fist into a mailed\npalm.\n\nExultation bubbled up within Daoud like a desert spring. Dizzy with joy,\nhe thought Baibars must have felt like this when he alone led the\nMamelukes against the Tartars at the Well of Goliath.\n\nA certainty that the battle was as good as won spread through him.\n\n\"If we leave you any Frenchmen to smash,\" he said to Barth, who laughed,\nsaluted, and rode away.\n\n_Have a care_, he warned himself. _What happens today will be as God\nwants. I want only whatever God wants._\n\nHe jerked on the reins of his brown Arabian to turn toward the French\ncharge. They were still far away. The valley was long. He called Omar\nand Husain to him.\n\n\"Bows and arrows. Spread out in a line. When we are formed up, advance\nat a trot on my signal.\"\n\nHe unstrapped his bow from his saddle and slung it over his shoulder and\nacross his chest.\n\nThe five flag men lined up behind Daoud. On their right rode a naqeeb\nholding high the green banner of the Sons of the Falcon, inscribed in\ndazzling white lettering with a verse from the Koran: HAVE THEY NOT\nSEEN THE BIRDS OBEDIENT IN MIDAIR? NONE UPHOLDETH THEM SAVE GOD.\n\nOmar rode down the line relaying Daoud's orders to the officers and flag\nmen. When all was ready, Daoud raised his hand and brought it down. A\nsingle line of two hundred horsemen, they moved out at a trot. While his\nmen could fire arrows from a galloping horse, the slower the horse was\nmoving, the more accurate the shooting.\n\nHe could see what was coming at him much more clearly now. The middle\nand rear ranks of the crusaders were obscured by dust, but in the front\nranks a hundred or more helmeted heads bent over the armored brows of\ntheir huge horses. The long poles of their steel-tipped lances pointed\nat him.\n\nTo be hit by one of those knights galloping at that speed, with all that\nweight of steel and horseflesh, would be like being hit by a boulder\nfrom a stone caster. If the Franks got much closer, there would be no\nstopping them.\n\nDaoud unslung his bow. From the corner of his eye he saw the flag men,\nwhose duty it was to watch his moves and signals, lift five red pennants\nhigh. He did not need to look to know that the Sons of the Falcon had\nall dropped their horses' reins, guiding their horses with their knees,\nand were drawing their bows.\n\nHis bow, like those his men carried, was double-curved, made of multiple\nlayers of horn and hardwood. His arrow had a thick steel tip that could\npunch through mail armor like a spike driven by a hammer. He took aim at\na big Frank in the middle of the line. The intersection of the limbs of\nthe red cross on the Frank's white surcoat made a perfect spot to aim\nat. Between two beats of his Arabian's hooves, he loosed his arrow.\n\nThe flight of Daoud's arrow was the signal for the red flags to go down.\nTwo hundred arrows whistled across the rapidly narrowing gap between\ncrusaders and Sons of the Falcon.\n\nDaoud saw the man he had fired at throw his arms wide. His lance dropped\nas he leaned sideways from his saddle. He crashed to the ground and\ndisappeared under the hooves of the horses behind his. His lance fell\nacross the paths of the oncoming crusaders and another of the big war\nhorses tripped over it, dumping its rider.\n\nAll along the crusaders' front, knights were spilling from their\nsaddles, horses were falling, lances were flying.\n\n_Over a hundred years they have fought us, and they have never learned\nto use the bow from the saddle._\n\nMany riders in the crusaders' front rank were still galloping toward\nthem. And more in the rear ranks were dodging or leaping the fallen\nknights and horses. Daoud whipped a second arrow from the quiver hanging\nat his side, nocked it, and took quick aim.\n\nHis arrow went true again. He saw the targeted man fall. And the Sons of\nthe Falcon were pouring volleys of arrows into the Franks. Every third\ncrusader, in the front ranks at least, must be a dead man.\n\nDaoud heard himself yelling in triumph. If they broke this first French\ncharge, the rest of Manfred's army could sweep the field clear of the\nenemy.\n\nThe charge was slowing down, but it was still coming on.\n\n\"Split ranks! Pass them on either side!\" Daoud called to Omar, who\nrelayed the order to the flag men.\n\nDaoud heard a sound like an earthquake behind him and looked around. The\nelite of the German knights, Manfred's Swabians, were galloping on in an\narrowhead formation. If the French knights and their horses were big,\nthe Swabians looked even bigger. He saw the nodding green plumes of\nManfred's helmet at the very point of the wedge. The surcoats of knights\nand horses were ablaze with red and blue, orange and yellow.\n\nBeyond Manfred's knights Daoud saw lines of crossbowmen formed up before\nthe walls of Benevento. Sophia was there in that little town. He wanted\nto keep himself between Sophia and the French.\n\nBut Omar had relayed his order to the flag men and the yellow and green\nflags had gone up, and, disciplined as any of his men, he rode off to\nthe left, turning the side of his Arabian toward the onrushing\ncrusaders.\n\nWhen he reached the right flank of Charles's knights, he turned again so\nthat he was riding past them. He fired arrow after arrow as he went, as\nfast as he could and still hit his mark.\n\nHe saw a tall figure in a red surcoat with a red helmet shaped like a\nbishop's miter. Almost certainly de Verceuil. The cardinal brandished a\nclub with an iron ball at the end of it. Daoud loosed an arrow at him,\nbut de Verceuil lifted a red shield bearing a painted gold cross that\ncaught the arrow and sent it spinning away.\n\n_I wonder if he recognizes me._\n\nLooking north, Daoud saw Anjou's foot soldiers with spears and crossbows\nadvancing at a run, but they were far behind the last of the Frankish\nriders. Charles must have thrown all his knights--eight hundred of them,\nManfred had said--into this first charge. He, like Manfred, must have\nhoped to end the battle--even the war--with a single charge.\n\nFarther to the north, beyond the foot soldiers, a dozen or so horsemen\nin yellow and purple cloaks gathered under a red banner bearing a black\nfigure. It was too far away for Daoud to see clearly, but he knew that a\nblack lion on a red background was the standard of Charles d'Anjou.\n\nNow Daoud and his left half of the Sons of the Falcon were beyond the\nFrench knights. He ordered the flag signals that would turn his wing to\nride back the way they had come.\n\nDozens of Franks had died under their arrows. The charge had slowed,\nwith confusion on the front and confusion on the sides. Daoud felt\nripples of triumph course through his body. They had done the very thing\nManfred said no Saracen cavalry could do.\n\n_We stopped the charge of the Frankish knights._\n\nBut looking toward Benevento, Daoud felt triumph turn to dismay. The\nflying wedge of Manfred's knights had pushed itself deep into the French\nline, but then had come to a stop. Even though the Sons of the Falcon\nhad hurt them and halted them, the French had held their formation. They\nhad not broken under the Swabian attack.\n\nDaoud groaned in anguish. Both sides had stopped in their tracks, and\nwhere they faced each other their formations had crumbled into a hundred\nindividual combats.\n\nThis was just what Daoud had feared and warned against. Endless\nbutchery, futile bloodletting, a battle that would go as badly for the\nwinner as for the loser.\n\n_There must be another way_, Daoud thought desperately. _There must be a\nMameluke way to win this._\n\n\n\n\nLXVIII\n\n\nThierry reined his horse to a stop and doffed his helmet in salute to\nSimon. From the wild look in the young knight's eye Simon sensed at once\nthat he had seen something extraordinary.\n\n\"What is it, Messire?\" he demanded. \"Did you see Manfred's army?\"\nPapillon, the brown and white mare Simon used as a palfrey, stood still\nwhile Simon patted her neck.\n\n\"Manfred's _and_ Count Charles's,\" Thierry panted. \"Both armies. They're\nalready fighting, Monseigneur!\"\n\n\"Merciful God!\" A battle meant _the_ battle. One battle must surely\ndecide this war. Manfred would have brought together all the fighting\nmen of southern Italy and Sicily. And Simon knew, from the series of\nurgent messages he had received from Charles on the road, that the count\nhad left Rome with every man he could muster, and that there was no more\nhelp on its way to him.\n\n_Except for this army._\n\nSimon glanced up at the sun. Halfway up the eastern sky. Some big\nclouds, but it was going to remain a clear, cold day. If the battle had\nstarted at dawn, it could be over by midday.\n\n\"Pass the word to advance at a trot,\" he told de Puys. \"Foot soldiers to\nproceed by forced march.\"\n\nAntoine de la Durie spoke up. \"Monseigneur, should we not call a halt\nand rest and plan? We cannot plunge blindly into the midst of a battle.\"\n\n\"We will have to plan as we ride, Messire,\" Simon said brusquely. \"King\nCharles is outnumbered, and needs us _now_.\"\n\nHe felt a small inner glow. He was getting to be quite practiced at\nputting older men of lower rank in their place--the sort who formerly\nintimidated him.\n\nHe turned to Valery de Pirenne. \"Tell Friar Volpe to join me here. And\nyou, Thierry, come with me. You can tell the friar what you saw.\"\n\nSimon pulled Papillon's head over, jumped the narrow ditch along the\nside of the road, and took up a position on a rocky hummock, Thierry\nbeside him. Looking over the long column of his army never failed to\nmake his heart beat faster. A dozen banners in front, led by the red and\nwhite crusader flag and the purple and gold of Gobignon. Mounted knights\ntwo or three abreast followed by files of foot soldiers and baggage\ntrains and strings of chargers and spare horses. The mounted rear guard\nso far back it was usually out of sight.\n\nHe could see the rear guard because the army was traveling along winding\nmountain roads, as it had been the day before and the day before that.\nThey were crossing the center of the Italian peninsula. They had been\nthrough the highest of the Apennines yesterday and were now descending\nthe western slopes.\n\nA chill anxiety enveloped his body. To have come all this way only to be\ntoo late--what a calamity that would be! He could not allow it.\n\nFriar Volpe came galloping up on the back of his big mule. How wise of\nCharles to have sent this friar to meet Simon at Ravenna. The Dominican\nhad spent most of his adult life wandering all over Italy preaching, and\nhe made an excellent guide. It was he who brought the news that Charles\nwas no longer in Rome and there was no need for Simon's army to go\nthere. A more direct route to Anjou's army would follow the Adriatic\ncoast, then turn southward into the Apennines on entering the Abruzzi,\nthe northernmost reach of Manfred's kingdom.\n\nFriar Volpe was a fair-skinned man with a sharp nose, large lips, and\nround brown eyes. His thick reddish-brown hair fell over his forehead\nand ears, growing luxuriantly everywhere except for the tonsure on top,\nwhere it was just a red stubble.\n\n\"Benevento,\" he said when Simon told him about the battle, and glanced\nup at the sun. \"We could arrive in the valley of Benevento well before\nnoon. There is a high ridge along the east side of the valley. Benevento\nis a crossroads town. The roads meet at the south end of the valley.\"\n\n\"That was where I saw Manfred's camp,\" said Thierry.\n\n\"I have to see this valley myself,\" Simon said. \"Could we climb this\nridge you spoke of?\"\n\n\"Shepherds and their flocks go up and down the hills all year round,\"\nsaid Friar Volpe. \"There are many paths.\"\n\n\"Many paths,\" Simon echoed. \"Excellent. Be good enough to lead us\nthere.\"\n\nSimon ordered the army to continue along the main road to Benevento\nuntil they reached a roadside shrine to San Rocco. Farther than that,\nFriar Volpe said, and they might be seen from Benevento.\n\nFriar Volpe led Simon at a fast trot till they were out of sight of the\narmy. Thierry and Henri de Puys had insisted on coming along, arguing\nthat Simon might meet some of Manfred's outriders. They turned onto a\nzigzag track that sometimes disappeared altogether over bare rocks as it\nclimbed to the top of a long ridge.\n\nThey came out of a stand of wind-twisted pine trees to the bald top of\nthe ridge. The ringing of steel on steel, the pounding of horses'\nhooves, and the cries of men drifted to them from below.\n\n\"Hold the horses, Thierry,\" Simon ordered. He and de Puys and Friar\nVolpe moved forward at a crouch. When he could see the battlefield,\nSimon lay down and crawled, his mail scraping over the rocks, the tip of\nhis sheathed sword bumping along.\n\n_Is this what a battle looks like, then?_\n\nHe was reminded of times when he had stepped on anthills in the woods\nand thousands of the little creatures milled about in confusion under\nhis feet. Masses of men below heaved and struggled. Dead horses lay by\nthe score, large dark lumps. Smaller objects lying about the field like\nrocks might be dead men; it was hard to tell from this distance. Much of\nwhat he saw was partly veiled by clouds of gray dust.\n\nHe felt a breath of fear on his neck at the thought that he must take\nhis army into that cauldron. He tried to make sense of what he was\nseeing. Where were the leaders?\n\nThe half of the field nearer him was hidden by the trees growing lower\ndown on this ridge. Ignoring de Puys's whispered warnings, he crawled\nfarther forward for a better view.\n\nNow he saw the town of Benevento at the south end of the valley, a city\nof moderate size whose walls were fortified by a dozen square towers.\nAnd before it a smaller city of many-colored tents. Above the tents, a\nyellow banner with a black splotch in its center. That would be the\nHohenstaufen eagle.\n\nThen those tents at the other end of the valley, where the road entered\nfrom the north, must be the French camp. Simon saw many more banners,\ntoo far away to recognize, on poles in the center of that camp.\n\nHe saw no fighting at the north end of the valley. Closer to the battle,\na small group of horsemen sat on a low hill, apparently observing. Above\nthem a red and black banner hung from a long pole. That could only be\nCharles himself, and his chief commanders, under the banner of the black\nlion. Lines of foot soldiers screened them from the main fighting.\n\n_I should go down there, or send someone, to find out what Count Charles\nwants me to do. But there is no time._\n\nAgain Simon's gaze swept the battlefield. The innumerable small\nstruggles, mostly in the center of the valley, told him that neither\nside was winning. Again the Saracen warriors with the turbans caught his\neye. They were the only group of mounted men acting together. Moving in\na V-shaped formation with the center back and the tips of the two wings\nwell forward, they advanced slowly across the field. But with such\nconfusion around them, where could they effectively attack?\n\n_Never mind that. Where can I effectively attack?_\n\nHe lay on his belly, his chin resting on his intertwined fingers, his\nbreath steaming in the air in front of him. Thierry, de Puys, and Friar\nVolpe were waiting behind him. And behind them, the army he had brought\nhere. A sudden terror froze his limbs. The day was cold, but he felt\ncolder still, staring at the swirling fury below him, listening to the\nshouts and screams, the thundering and clanging.\n\nThere would not be time to get orders from Count Charles. There would\nhardly be time to consult with the experienced men--de Marion, de la\nDurie, de Puys--among the barons he had brought with him. The plan, the\ndecisions, would have to be his alone.\n\nAt what place, at what moment, should he throw the Gobignon army into\nthe battle? If he just led them into the present confusion, his columns\nof knights and files of archers would at once fall apart into more knots\nand whirlpools of combat like those he saw below. His army could be\nwasted, ground up like wheat in a water mill. The turmoil in his mind\nwas as bad as the chaos he had seen on the field.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe floor of the valley was uneven, and rolling hills hid the battle\nfrom Lorenzo's eyes, but the clash and clamor of the fighting carried to\nhis ears as he approached the French camp. It was empty except for about\nten sentries, some armed with crossbows, others with pikes, who stood at\nits perimeter. They were all turned to watch the battle, their backs to\nLorenzo despite the creaking of his wagon and the clip-clop of his\nhorse's hooves.\n\nThe tall tents were dusty, stained, and patched, their colors faded.\n\nLorenzo spotted a party of horsemen in bright cloaks atop a hill outside\nthe camp. One helmet was topped with a gilded crown.\n\nCharles was being sensible, standing back from the battle and watching\nit--unlike Manfred, whom Lorenzo had seen just as he was leaving the\nHohenstaufen camp, riding into the fray waving his great broadsword.\nLorenzo shook his head sadly.\n\n_What my king needs is less gallantry and more ruthlessness._\n\nHolding up a parchment covered with elaborate handwriting and a large\nseal of green wax with long ribbons, he pulled his cart up to the\nnearest guard, a stout, white-haired man with bleary eyes. Naturally,\nonly the least able-bodied would be left to guard the camp this day. And\nthe worst they would be expecting would be attempts at thievery by the\nwhores and traders whose tents and wagons lay a short distance up the\nroad from the camp.\n\n\"Here is my safe conduct from King Charles's ally, the bishop of\nAgnani,\" said Lorenzo briskly. He held his breath anxiously while the\nguard stared at him.\n\n\"We are in the middle of a battle, man. You can't just drive your cart\nin here. What do you have in it?\"\n\nThe guard barely glanced at the document Lorenzo had spent a precious\nhour forging. Lorenzo was relieved. He was not at all sure the scroll\nwould bear close scrutiny, although only one soldier in a thousand could\nread. And any clerics who might be along with Charles would probably be\non the edges of the battlefield, succoring the wounded and dying.\n\n\"I bring a gift of wine from the Bishop of Agnani to the ambassadors\nfrom Tartary.\"\n\n\"I will have to taste the wine,\" said the white-haired guard\nimportantly.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Lorenzo with a grin, and as the guard climbed into the\ndark interior of the cart, almost fully occupied by two big wine casks\nstanding on their bottoms, Lorenzo unhooked a tin ladle from its wooden\nwall and handed it to the stout man.\n\nStupid as well as unfit this guard was, thought Lorenzo. He could stun\nhim with the sack of sand and stones hidden under his tunic or slit his\nthroat with the dagger in his boot. But then he would have a body to get\nrid of. This particular body would be more of a problem dead than it was\nalive and conscious. Lorenzo turned a spigot and let some of the red\nwine flow into the ladle.\n\nThe guard smacked his lips and grunted. \"Too good for those slant-eyed\nbarbarians.\"\n\n\"Right, my friend,\" Lorenzo agreed. \"But the bishop cultivates their\nfriendship because he finds them interesting. These high-horse folk have\nno common sense.\"\n\n\"If you want to know what is interesting,\" said the guard, \"what is\ninteresting is the pretty little putana the older Tartar travels with.\nThey say she's a Jewess. I have often wondered if she would be partial\nto other older men.\"\n\n_Rachel! That pig of a Tartar dragged that poor child here to this\ndamned war._\n\n\"That is interesting, all right. Now, where the hell do I find these\nTartars?\"\n\nThe guard poured himself another ladle full of wine without bothering to\nask, and drained it with more loud lip noises. Then he and Lorenzo\nclimbed out of the cart.\n\n\"Their tent is the one with blue and yellow stripes in the center of the\ncamp. You see it? But I do not think you will find them there.\"\n\nLorenzo had suspected that the Tartars would not stay in their tent. If\nthey were out watching the battle with Charles's commanders, it would be\nwell-nigh impossible to kill them in full view of so many of the enemy.\nBut that had occurred to him before he left Manfred's camp. He had\nthought of another way to carry out Daoud's orders. Along with the\ncasks, he had brought one jar of a very special wine, laced with enough\nbelladonna to kill a whole army of Tartars. He would leave that to greet\nthem on their return from the battle. Then he would unhitch his dappled\nbrown and white gelding, a good riding horse, and scout around the edges\nof the battle to see if there was some way to get at the Tartars more\ndirectly.\n\nA crossbowman sat on the ground at the entrance to the blue and yellow\nstriped tent. He picked up the bow that lay on the ground beside him and\njumped to his feet when Lorenzo drove up. Lorenzo remembered seeing him\nguarding the Tartars in Orvieto, and his heart beat heavily for a\nmoment, but the man gave no sign of recognizing him.\n\nLorenzo held up his splendid parchment and explained his mission.\n\n\"They are not here,\" said the guard sourly.\n\n\"Well, the Bishop of Agnani is an important ally of your King Charles.\nHelp me unload this wine.\" Lorenzo went around the cart and pulled the\nback down to make a ramp.\n\n\"It is good wine.\" Lorenzo continued, \"and you can drink your fill after\nwe get it into the tent. The Tartars will not miss a few cupfuls.\"\n\nGrumbling despite the promised reward, the guard helped Lorenzo\nmanhandle the cask to the back of the cart, tip it, and roll it down to\nthe ground. Then they unloaded the other one.\n\nThe guard stood back to let Lorenzo roll the first cask by himself\nthrough the loose flap into the Tartars' tent.\n\n\"Stay away from the girl,\" he growled at Lorenzo's back. \"His Eminence\nthe cardinal says she's under arrest.\"\n\nLorenzo stiffened, and a chill gripped him. What danger was Rachel in\nnow?\n\nAs Lorenzo straightened up, he heard a gasp.\n\nThe tent was lit by a single candle and the daylight that filtered dimly\nthrough its silk walls. It was held up by two center poles and an oblong\nframework from which the sides were hung. Around the edges were camp\nbeds. Between the center posts was a table. Charcoal glowed in a\nbrazier, warming the interior of the tent.\n\nA shadowy figure rushed toward him. Lorenzo backed away, his hand\nreaching inside his tunic for the sandbag.\n\n\"Lorenzo!\"\n\n\"Rachel.\" His voice was choked.\n\nHer arms gripped him as tightly as if she were drowning. He felt warmth\nflood through him.\n\n\"Ah, Rachel.\" He had not seen her since he had taken her to Tilia\nCaballo's, and not a day went by that he had not cursed himself for\ndoing so. She looked well, her face pink, but thinner than he\nremembered. She was, he realized suddenly, very beautiful.\n\n\"I thought your name was Giancarlo,\" said a dry voice. Lorenzo looked up\nto see the old Franciscan monk who traveled with the Tartars standing\nnear him.\n\n\"What is going on here?\" The Venetian burst into the tent. \"Get your\nhands off that woman.\" He drew the shortsword he wore at his belt.\n\nLorenzo instantly let go of Rachel and stepped back. He bowed low,\nspreading his hands in a courtly gesture.\n\n\"Forgive me, Messere,\" he said in a placating tone. \"A long-lost\ncousin.\" His hand darted for his boot and seized the handle of his\ndagger.\n\n\"I don't believe that for a--\" the Venetian began, but his guard dropped\nslightly, and his words were cut off when Lorenzo's blade plunged into\nhis chest.\n\n\"Jesus have mercy!\" said the old Franciscan. The Venetian dropped to his\nknees and fell on his face on the carpeted wooden floor of the tent.\n\n\"Try to give an alarm and you are dead too, Father,\" Lorenzo growled.\n\n\"No, Lorenzo, no!\" Rachel cried. \"Friar Mathieu is a good man.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that would not matter to Messer Lorenzo,\" said Friar Mathieu,\nhis eyes fixed on Lorenzo with a penetrating stare. \"If, as I suspect,\nhe serves that elegant blasphemer Manfred von Hohenstaufen.\"\n\nLorenzo gave a short bark of a laugh. His heart was galloping.\n\nFriar Mathieu knelt and whispered prayers in Latin over the dead\nVenetian. With his thumb he traced a cross on the man's forehead.\n\n\"You think there is no good to be found in King Manfred's camp?\" Lorenzo\nsaid. \"I am not surprised. You Franciscans pride yourselves on your\nignorance.\"\n\nRachel's hand rested lightly on Lorenzo's arm. \"Lorenzo, I beg you, do\nnot insult Friar Mathieu. He has been my only friend since John took me\nfrom Madama Tilia's house. What are you doing here?\" Her face lit up\nwith hope. \"Have you come to take me away?\"\n\nLorenzo's mind was working rapidly. Apparently, Friar Mathieu was a\ndecent sort, and Lorenzo had no desire to kill him. But what to do with\nhim? Rachel might have given him the answer. This was, in fact, a\nGod-given chance to get her away from the Tartars. And Daoud, he knew,\nwould bless him for it.\n\n\"Where are the Tartars, Rachel?\" he said.\n\n\"They put on mail and took bows and arrows and swords, and they have\njoined the fighting.\"\n\nLorenzo was astonished. \"Charles is risking their lives in this battle?\nPazzia!\" And the would-be king of Sicily himself was not even fighting.\n\n\"Yes, it does seem mad, does it not?\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"Well, that is good,\" said Lorenzo. \"I was afraid I might have to fight\nthem for you, Rachel. Why did this lout say you are under arrest?\"\n\n\"The cardinal accuses me of spying for King Manfred. He says you were\nall spying--you, Madonna Sophia, Messer David. Is that true?\"\n\nLorenzo looked from Rachel to Friar Mathieu. There was no need to keep\nit from them any longer. For good or ill, all would be settled today.\n\n\"In a word, yes.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Friar Mathieu exclaimed. \"I knew it.\"\n\nLorenzo felt himself grinning suddenly. \"I could tell the cardinal that\nyou knew nothing about us, but I do not think my testimony would help\nyou. Perhaps it would be best if I just got you away from here.\"\n\nRachel's face was like a sunrise. \"Oh, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Good. Wait one moment now.\"\n\nHe went out of the tent and looked around. There were no guards in\nsight. He rolled the second wine cask into the tent and set it beside\nthe first. He dragged the Venetian's body into a corner, where anyone\nlooking in would not see it.\n\n\"You have actually come here in the midst of this battle to rescue\nRachel from John the Tartar?\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\nThe old priest might still have a protective feeling toward the Tartars,\nLorenzo thought. Best not to tell him the real reason.\n\n\"I guessed that right now there would be less of a guard on her,\" said\nLorenzo. \"And if you are as ashamed of your part in what has happened to\nher as I am of mine, you will help me. You really should come with me.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"I have no great confidence in your\nability to protect Rachel.\"\n\n\"You seem to have done little enough for her yourself,\" said Lorenzo\ngruffly. Friar Mathieu appeared angry as he opened his mouth, but then\nhe closed it again, without speaking.\n\n_A good Christian. Turning the other cheek._\n\nTrying to see in all directions at once, Lorenzo carried blankets from\nthe tent and threw them into the back of the cart. He took the\nlong-necked jar of poisoned wine from under the driver's seat. Looking\naround for guards and seeing them all gazing southward toward the\nbattle, he went back into the tent and put the wine on the table.\n\n\"This wine was my disguise,\" he said. \"I am bringing a gift of wine for\nthe Tartars from the Bishop of Agnani.\" Much better to tell them no more\nthan that.\n\n\"My chest, my treasures,\" Rachel said. Lorenzo sprang at the box she\npointed out and gripped it by both handles. He was shocked at its\nweight.\n\n\"My God! I do not know if I can--\"\n\nA sudden fear came over him. There was no time for this! If he were\ncaught now, with the dead Venetian, Rachel would surely be executed, and\nhe along with her.\n\nHe hoisted the box to the level of his hipbone, feeling as if his spine\nwould snap. Rachel and Friar Mathieu put their hands under it, easing\nthe load a little. Panting, the three of them wrestled the chest out of\nthe tent, and with one heart-bursting effort Lorenzo heaved it up into\nthe rear of the cart.\n\nHe glanced about him and saw that they were still not being watched.\n\nHe picked up the dead archer's crossbow and quiver of arrows and set\nthem beside the driver's seat at the front of the cart, although he\nhoped he would not have to fight his way out of this place.\n\nBustling Rachel and Friar Mathieu into the cart, he had them hide under\nthe blankets, in case any of the guards around Charles's camp should\nwant to look inside.\n\nIt seemed to him that he held his breath all the way from the Tartars'\ntent to the edge of the French camp. But the elderly guard he had spoken\nto barely glanced at him as he drove by with a wave.\n\nThe battle seemed unchanged as his cart creaked and rattled along the\nnarrow dirt track leading through the hills west of the valley. Save\nthat more dead littered the rolling brown landscape. Charles still stood\non his mound, not deigning to get into the fight himself.\n\nHorsemen and foot soldiers struggled in crowds the length of the valley.\nThe Tartars, whom he had come to kill, must be fighting down there\nsomewhere. With luck they would die, either on the battlefield or later.\n\nHe kept his eyes moving, watching everything. Arrows or stragglers from\nthe battle might get the three of them. They would not be safe until\nthey reached Manfred's camp. If then.\n\n\"Oh, Lorenzo, I'm so happy!\" Crying, Rachel threw her arms around his\nneck.\n\nEmbarrassed, he said gruffly, \"Easy, child. I have to see what is going\non down there.\" He gently pulled her arms loose.\n\nThe track had climbed high enough to give him a view of the south end of\nthe valley. With a glow of pleasure he saw that Daoud had kept the Sons\nof the Falcon intact. There was their green banner with its white\ninscription. There were their turbans, red dots forming a line across\nthe valley.\n\nA warm feeling swept over him as he made out Daoud's figure in the\ncenter of the line. Never had he met a man he admired more, not even\nManfred. He caught himself praying that Daoud would live through the\nbattle and be victorious.\n\nHe had seen the Sons of the Falcon attack earlier today and check the\nfirst French charge with their volleys of arrows. Now they seemed to be\nriding to attack again. What was their objective?\n\nA flash of light above the battle caught his eye. Sunlight reflected on\nmetal. He looked across at the bare gray rocks that topped the high\nridge on the other side of the valley. He could see beyond the rocks the\ntips of a pine forest. Again the flash of light.\n\nHelmets.\n\nTen or more conical helmets appeared between the forest and the rocks.\nMen were crawling over the top of the ridge. The lower slopes of the\nridge, on the valley side, were heavily forested. Those men would be\nquite hidden from anyone looking up from the valley.\n\nWho were they? And how many? The hills over there could conceal\nhundreds. They could be some of Manfred's troops, sent up there to make\na surprise flank attack. But Manfred had rejected just such a plan.\n\nHe remembered now a conversation between Daoud and Manfred at dawn. Not\nall of Charles's allies had yet arrived. The Gobignon banner, for\ninstance, had not been seen with Charles's army.\n\nThat could be a whole fresh army of Frenchmen up there on that ridge,\nabout to fall like an avalanche on Manfred's forces.\n\nAnd Daoud's Sons of the Falcon were rapidly advancing up the valley.\n\nLorenzo felt himself trembling. He wanted to scream a warning.\n\n_I have to reach Daoud._\n\nHe jerked the horse to a stop and called to Rachel and Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"I have to leave you.\"\n\n\"Lorenzo!\" Rachel's eyes were huge with terror.\n\nHe took her hands. \"Listen. I love you like my own daughter. But I have\njust seen something--I have to warn them. Daoud--David--will be killed.\"\n\n\"David of Trebizond?\" said Friar Mathieu. \"You called him Daoud?\" The\nold priest's eyes were alight with sudden understanding.\n\n\"Never mind.\" Lorenzo heard his own voice rising in panic. He took a\ndeep breath to steady himself, then plunged back into the cart and\nseized the saddle he had tucked away in the back. He jumped down from\nthe cart, unhitched the gelding, and threw the saddle over its back.\n\n\"Oh, my God, Lorenzo!\" Rachel screamed. \"Take me with you. Don't leave\nme here.\"\n\n\"I will be back for you,\" he said as he fought to get saddle and bridle\non the horse. \"I swear it. I have no time to talk. I have to do this.\"\nWanting something more than a dagger to defend himself with, he grabbed\nthe crossbow he had taken from the guard at the Tartar's tent, and\nstrapped the quiver of bolts to his waist.\n\nThe gelding expelled a breath as he threw himself on its back.\n\nRachel was still screaming, but he could not make out her words over his\nhorse's hoofbeats as he galloped away.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" he cried over his shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nLXIX\n\n\nDaoud's dark brown Arabian stallion sidestepped a knot of fighting men.\nDaoud's heart beat slowly and heavily in his chest like a funeral bell.\nThe field was still a chaos. The battle was still in doubt. But in\nindividual combats more of Manfred's men than Charles's were falling.\nDaoud had seen--and it had made him almost angry enough to want to break\nout of his formation and pursue them--a group of Apulian crossbowmen\nrunning off the field. Bands of Charles's knights were getting together\nand overwhelming smaller bands of Manfred's.\n\nIt was the power of Christianity, Daoud thought. Charles's men had been\ntold by the pope himself that they were crusaders waging a holy war and\nwould be taken up into heaven if they died in battle. Manfred's\nChristian warriors had been excommunicated, without the sacraments, for\nover a year, and many of them believed that if they were killed they\nwould go to hell. Daoud could not be sure how strongly the men on either\nside felt about these things, but it could be enough to tilt the battle\nslowly in Charles's favor.\n\nOn Manfred's side, the only ones who felt they were waging a holy war\nwere the Sons of the Falcon.\n\nDaoud recalled Lorenzo's words to Manfred months before: _I have never\nin my life doubted the_ power _of religion, Sire._\n\nManfred himself had disappeared into one of these whirlpools of combat.\nDaoud had searched everywhere for Erhard Barth, who should be pulling\nManfred's army together and giving orders, if Manfred would not do it\nhimself. He could find the marshal nowhere. There were no plans. There\nwere no leaders.\n\nThe Arabian's broad back rolled easily under him. He had kept the Sons\nof the Falcon in formation, ordering them to advance, hoping for a\nchance to strike a decisive blow. Staying out of the fighting they\npassed, moving around the groups of struggling men and reforming ranks,\nwas frustrating for his men, but so far their discipline had held.\n\nStaying together had protected them too. He estimated he had lost only\nabout twenty men so far.\n\nMusic, familiar martial music of the kind he had often heard in El\nKahira, flared up behind him, sending a thrill up his spine. The little\nmounted Muslim band had kept pace with the Sons of the Falcon.\n\nHe and the Sons of the Falcon had reached the midpoint of the valley.\nBenevento behind him and Charles's camp ahead were equally distant. In\nboth directions the sights were the same--horsemen flailing at each\nother with swords and axes and maces, crossbowmen and pikemen struggling\namong the horses' legs. Few arrows flew now, because an archer was as\nlikely as not to hit someone on his own side.\n\nDaoud narrowed his eyes. He saw again at the north end of the valley the\nbrown hill, a bit higher than any near it, the cluster of men on\nhorseback.\n\nSunlight glittered on a helmet adorned with a crown.\n\nHe felt suddenly lifted up. He wanted to laugh aloud.\n\n_Lord of the worlds! You have shown me the way!_\n\nWith one blow they could end the battle.\n\n\"Omar!\"\n\nHis second in command rode to his side, white teeth shining in his thick\nblack beard.\n\nDaoud pointed up the valley. \"Do you see that red and black banner and\nthat group of knights under it? Do you see a gold crown shining on a\nhelmet? That is Charles d'Anjou, he who would steal our lord Manfred's\nthrone.\"\n\n\"I see him, Emir Daoud. May God send him to the fire whose fuel is men\nand stones.\"\n\n\"May we be permitted to help God send Charles d'Anjou to that fire.\nThere is nothing between him and us but men fighting one another and a\nline of foot soldiers we can sweep away with our arrows.\"\n\n\"I see, My Lord. I see.\"\n\n\"Pass the order to charge. Charge at the red and black banner.\"\n\n\"Gladly, My Lord. Death to Charles d'Anjou!\"\n\nThe blue flags, signal for a charge, rose and waved over the Sons of the\nFalcon. Daoud felt the tension build in the men riding beside him. He\nunslung his double-curved Turkish bow and held it high for all his men\nto see.\n\nThe naqeeb who carried the banner rode out before them, holding up the\ngreen silk with its verse from the Koran.\n\n\"Yah l'Allah!\" Daoud shouted. He put all his strength, all his will,\ninto the cry.\n\nHis men took it up.\n\n\"Yah l'Allah!\"\n\n\"Allahu akbar!\"\n\nHe brought the bow down to his side. The blue flags dipped. The\nkettledrums rumbled and thundered to a crescendo. The trumpets blared.\nHe drove his heels hard into the Arabian's flanks. The horse catapulted\nforward instantly, throwing Daoud back against his saddle.\n\nHe leaned into the cold wind, squinting his eyes against the rush of\nair, feeling it blow through his beard. He looked to the right and to\nthe left. The Sons of the Falcon were racing beside him, these good men,\nthese warriors to whom he had taught his Mameluke's skills, these\ncomrades he had come to love.\n\n_Now we are truly Sons of the Falcon. We dive to kill our prey._\n\nHis left hand held the reins lightly, giving the horse his head. At this\nspeed he had to trust the horse to find the way. They were partners.\nThey jumped over a dead crossbowman. They leapt a great fallen Frankish\ncharger. Daoud felt as if he had wings. He laughed aloud. They dodged\naround a melee. He rocked to the jolting as the horse's hooves hit the\nground.\n\nThere ahead, the red and black banner planted in the soil of the hill\nwas much closer. Daoud could clearly make out the black rampant lion. He\ncould see the tall, broad-shouldered man wearing a blood-red cloak and\nthe helmet with the gilded crown. The man was staring this way, perhaps\nonly now becoming aware of his danger.\n\nA crossbow bolt hummed viciously past Daoud's ear. To his right a man\ncried out and fell from the saddle. Hamid. He felt a moment's pain.\n\nNo time for fear or sorrow. He crested a small hill and saw lines of\ncrossbowmen on a long rise of ground that ran across the valley. They\nwere far away, still small figures, but growing larger as Daoud galloped\non. They were turning their backs, having just fired. Their first volley\nhad hit only a few of Daoud's men, because the Sons of the Falcon were\nstill out of their crossbows' short range. Facing Daoud now were the big\nrectangular shields they wore on their backs. The row of shields leaned\naway from him as the men bent to draw their bows.\n\nCharles d'Anjou and the men around him were gesturing and pointing. Did\nthey really expect these archers to save them?\n\nDaoud pulled an arrow from his saddle quiver and nocked it.\n\n\"The instant they turn, shoot!\" he shouted. He heard his order echoed as\nthe word was passed down the line. The red flags went up. He took aim at\nthe back of a man in the center of the crossbowmen's line.\n\nThe archers whirled, bringing their bows up. The red flags dipped. As he\nfelt his galloping horse's hooves leave the ground, Daoud released the\nstring. He saw the man he had targeted drop his bow and fall to the\nground.\n\nThe Falcons' arrows swept the crossbowmen like a scythe. The powerful\nTurkish bows could shoot farther and be reloaded faster than the\nEuropean weapons. The few archers not felled by their volleys ran to the\nsides of the valley to safety.\n\nCharles was too far away for Daoud to read his expression, but his arms\nwere waving frantically, as if he were trying to conjure up knights out\nof thin air. The men around him clutched at him, clearly telling him\nthey must ride for their lives. One of Charles's men had pulled the red\nand black banner out of the ground and looked ready to gallop away with\nit.\n\nDaoud slung his bow across his back and drew his long, curving saif from\nthe scabbard. The noonday sun flashed on it as he held it high. His men\nroared and brandished their own swords.\n\nThe band had caught up with them, and the trumpets and hautboys screamed\ndeath to the enemy while the kettledrums rumbled.\n\nThere was nothing left to protect Charles d'Anjou now. There was not\neven time for the French leader to run for it. He seemed to know it. He\nhad his sword out and he held up a white shield with a red cross.\n\nUrging the Arabian on, shouting the name of God, Daoud raced toward\ntriumph.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn hands and knees Simon stared horrified as the long line of\nred-turbaned riders charged at Charles's position.\n\nThe Saracen riders still had half the length of the valley to cross\nbefore they reached Charles's position. The French foot archers--some of\nthem must be the same men Simon had briefly commanded before the gates\nof Rome--were lining up to protect their king. There was time, but very\nlittle.\n\n\"God have mercy!\" exclaimed Antoine de la Durie.\n\nSimon backed away from the hilltop, stood up, and turned. All down the\nside of the ridge hidden from the valley of Benevento, rows of knights\nsat on their great horses, hefted lances, thrust at the air with their\nswords. Some were still struggling into their mail shirts with the help\nof their equerries. Hundreds of faces looked up inquiringly at Simon.\nTrees hid the rest of his army, farther down the slope.\n\nHe took the polished helmet Valery held for him, its top adorned with an\nangry griffin spreading its wings, and set it down over the padded\narming cap that held it in place.\n\nDe la Durie, de Marion, de Puys, and ten more barons gathered around\nhim. They waited silently for him to speak.\n\nHe was shaking inwardly, and prayed that it would not show. He was\nafraid of death and of defeat. But, thank God, he was no longer in doubt\nabout what to do. He knew.\n\n\"Over a hundred Saracens are about to fall upon King Charles. There is\nno one near to help him. We must go down there now and stop them.\nStraight over the side of this ridge. Mount your horses.\"\n\n\"But, mercy of God, Monseigneur!\" cried de Puys. \"That slope is long and\nsteep. There is a forest. The men will fall. The horses will break their\nlegs. We must find a path.\"\n\n\"There is no time to explore, de Puys. There are many paths down. We\nwill find them. The horses will find them. We must go now. In a moment\nKing Charles will be dead!\"\n\nThe equerries holding the Gobignon and crusader banners rolled them up\nto take them through the forest.\n\nValery brought Simon's favorite war-horse, the pearl-gray destrier\ncalled Brillant. Simon braced himself for the effort, in full armor, of\nmounting the huge horse. He set his foot in the iron stirrup, hoisted\nhimself, swung his leg, heavy with mail, over the saddle, and settled\nhimself. He drew the Saracen blade Roland had given him.\n\n_A Saracen blade to fight Saracens._\n\nHe put fear and doubt out of his mind, drew a deep breath and roared,\n\"Suivez-moi!\"\n\nHe spurred Brillant and slapped the charger's neck. \"Good horse! Find a\nway down.\"\n\nThen he had plunged over the edge and into the forest on the other side.\nHe crouched, hiding his face behind Brillant's gray neck, as thick as a\ntree trunk. A branch struck his helmet with a clang, stunning him\nslightly, and he bent his head lower.\n\nTwisted trees rushed at him and past him. All around him he heard men\nshouting, some yelling in wild abandon, some crying out in fear. He\nheard a terrible crash and clatter and the mingled screams of a man and\na horse. Behind him came a thundering like a landslide as more and more\nof his knights plunged over the edge of the ridge.\n\nHe had time to think in jubilation that he had given a frightening,\ndifficult order, and the men had obeyed. Hundreds of knights and\nmen-at-arms were plummeting down this perilous slope because he had told\nthem to.\n\n_If I die today, I die a leader._\n\nBut would they reach the valley in time to save Charles d'Anjou? While\nthey rushed and fell and fought their way through this forest, that\nbattle line of Saracens was galloping over easy, rolling ground with\nonly Charles's archers to impede them. Just now Simon was crashing\nthrough woods so thick he could not see the battlefield.\n\nThen there was light ahead and a meadow of brown grass. Brillant broke\nthrough the brush at the bottom of the slope.\n\nThe red-turbaned line was a little past the place where Simon had come\nout. They were riding those light, fast Saracen horses.\n\nWhere were the lines of crossbowmen? Gone--and now Simon saw bodies\nscattered on the ground where the foot archers had stood.\n\nCharles's banner was still on the same hilltop. In moments the Saracens\nwould be upon him.\n\n\"Faster! Faster!\" Simon shouted, slapping Brillant's neck as the huge\nwar-horse ran at top speed to overtake the Saracen line.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud charged on, his eyes fixed on the crowned figure under the red and\nblack banner.\n\nThe pounding of hoofbeats in the air all around him was suddenly louder\nthan he thought possible. He had been hearing the ululating,\nhigh-pitched war cries of his men, but now heard screams of pain and\nshouts of battle and deeper war cries, voices shouting in French.\n\nComing from the right flank.\n\nHe turned. He glimpsed a purple banner rushing toward him. A white and\nred banner along with it. The horse beside his was thrown against him by\na blow that all but knocked him senseless. Caught between the two\nhorses' flanks, his right leg felt as if it were being crushed. As pain\nshot up into his hip, he reeled dizzily in the saddle and clutched the\nreins till his left arm ached, his right holding his saif aloft so as\nnot to stab one of his own men.\n\nHis horse fell against the one on his other side. All around him horses\nand riders were thrown to the ground. The Sons of the Falcon were flung\nabout wildly, their forward momentum broken by some unimaginable force\nthat had hurled itself upon them.\n\nAt the sight, he felt a giant hand reach into his chest and tear his\nheart out.\n\nThe Sons of the Falcon were buried under an avalanche of mail-clad\nFrankish warriors riding huge armored war-horses.\n\n_My God, my God! Why are you doing this to us?_\n\nHe wanted to fling himself down from his horse and smash himself on the\nground, screaming out his grief. In an instant he had been flung from\njoy to the very darkest pit of despair. In an instant he saw that\neverything was lost. His staring eyes were dry. This was all too sudden,\ntoo shocking, even for tears.\n\nWhere had these devils of Franks come from?\n\nDown out of the hills to the east. They were still coming, hundreds of\nthem, pouring down the forested slope and charging over the level ground\nof the valley. Broadswords, maces, battle axes, rose and fell. Their war\nshouts filled the air.\n\n\"Dieu et le Sepulcre!\"\n\n\"L'Eglise et le Pape!\"\n\n\"Le Roi Charles!\"\n\nHe saw the green and white Falcon banner go down. He heard the band\ninstruments give out their last ugly sounds as they and the men who\nplayed them perished under maces and axes. He saw with agony the deaths\nof men he had trained and ridden with--Husain, Said, Farraj, Omar--heads\nsmashed, bodies cloven. He felt in his own body the blows that killed\nthem.\n\nDaoud recognized the purple banner now. Three gold crowns. He had seen\nit before in Orvieto. Simon de Gobignon had come at last to this battle.\n\nHe should feel hatred for de Gobignon, but all he felt was a numb\ndespair.\n\nHis few remaining men crowded against him, forcing him to fall back. He\nrode back toward Benevento, away from the triumphant army of Gobignon,\ncrushed with sorrow. The Sons of the Falcon, the force he had taken a\nyear to build, had been destroyed in a flicker of time, as if the earth\nhad opened and swallowed them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLorenzo wept and cursed himself for being too late to warn Daoud before\nthe French attacked. He stood on the edge of the field, holding his\nhorse's reins in one hand and his crossbow in the other, watching the\nFrench knights sweep across the valley from east to west, trampling\neveryone in their path. Through his tears he saw the purple and gold\nbanner of Gobignon fluttering against the cold blue-and-white sky.\n\n_Simon de Gobignon. If only we had killed him in Orvieto._\n\nAll about him, men rode and ran and fought. Singly and in twos and\nthrees, horses without riders ran wildly this way and that. He wondered\nif Daoud was still alive. What had happened to King Manfred and the\nother Hohenstaufen leaders? Charles d'Anjou still occupied his hill at\nthe north end of the valley. Almost overwhelmed at the moment help\narrived, he had never moved.\n\nThere were fewer and fewer of Manfred's men in sight, and more of\nCharles's with their accursed red crosses.\n\nA line of about a dozen horsemen was coming toward him at a walk. Most\nof them wore crosses, but they looked like neither French knights nor\ntheir Guelfo allies. Lorenzo rubbed his eyes to clear his vision of\ntears and took a harder look. Two men rode in the center wearing\nbowl-shaped steel helmets and gleaming gray mail shirts without\nsurcoats. They held short, heavy bows in their hands. The brims of their\nhelmets shaded their faces, but Lorenzo could tell that their skin was\nbrowner than any Frank's or Italian's.\n\nThe men flanking them on either side wore conical helmets and what\nseemed to be leather breastplates and carried long, curving sabers. Bows\nwere slung over their shoulders. One man on the right end of the line\nwas dressed in a steel cuirass.\n\nLorenzo realized that he was seeing the Tartars and their Armenian\nbodyguards. And the man with the steel breastplate was Sordello. At the\nsight of the old bravo, Lorenzo felt fury boiling in him. Back in\nOrvieto, that man had deserted Daoud and him. Despite that, Daoud had\nsent him money through Ugolini in Perugia and Viterbo, and Sordello had\nsent them snippets of information. But Lorenzo had privately vowed that\nthe next time he saw Sordello he would squash him like a bedbug. And now\nhe appeared again, just after Simon de Gobignon smashed Daoud's final\nhope of victory.\n\nThe Tartars talked and gestured to each other, surveying the\nbattlefield. Their attention and that of their guards was on a melee\nthat was rolling rapidly toward them. A boiling mass of horsemen, the\nsurvivors of Daoud's Sons of the Falcon battling with the vanguard of\nthe Frankish knights, was struggling its way to the western side of the\nvalley.\n\nPartly hidden from the approaching Tartars by his horse, Lorenzo readied\nhis crossbow. He hooked the bowstring to his belt and put his right foot\nin the stirrup in front of the bow. He kicked out sharply, straightening\nhis right leg, and the bowstring snapped into place behind the catch. It\nwould be a pleasure to kill Sordello, but his first duty was to kill the\nTartars. And thus he would pay the French back for Daoud's defeat. This\nwould be much more satisfying than leaving poisoned wine in their tent.\nHe raised the bow, loaded a bolt, and stepped out into the Tartars'\npath.\n\n\"You little monsters!\" he shouted. The younger Tartar, Philip, brought\nhis head up, giving Lorenzo an even better shot. Lorenzo depressed the\ncatch, and the bolt smashed into the center of Philip's chest, right\nthrough the mail shirt. His eyes huge, Philip fell out of the saddle.\nHis frightened horse galloped away.\n\nLorenzo ducked back and bent to draw his bow. A moment later something\nhit the side of his horse and the animal gave an agonized whinny and\nfell to its knees. By that time Lorenzo had his bow cocked and loaded\nagain. He rose up from behind his dying horse.\n\nJohn was just drawing his bow for a second shot.\n\n\"For Rachel!\" Lorenzo called, and shot John in the same place he had hit\nPhilip, the center of the chest. The force of the bolt knocked John\nbackward.\n\nJohn toppled from his horse and slid to the ground. He cried out some\nwords in his Tartar language, shivered, and lay still.\n\nLorenzo stood a moment, breathing heavily. He felt the satisfaction of a\nman who has done a hard job that he had long wanted to complete. There\nwas no satisfied blood-lust, no gloating over vengeance achieved. It was\njust the good feeling of an archer whose arrows had gone true.\n\n\"Kill him!\" Sordello shouted.\n\nThe Armenians and Sordello thundered down upon him. Lorenzo set the\ncrossbow stirrup on the ground and put his foot into it, but he knew he\nwould not have time for another shot. He tensed himself for the bite of\nthose saber blades into his unarmored body.\n\nThen, like a curtain, the fleeing remnant of the Sons of the Falcon and\nthe French knights in pursuit on their gigantic horses swept between\nLorenzo and the Tartars' guards. Still clutching the crossbow, he ran.\n\nA bay Arabian horse, riderless, its eyes rolling in frenzy, galloped\ntoward him. Lorenzo threw down the crossbow and sprang into the animal's\npath, spreading his arms wide. The horse tried to dodge around him, but\nLorenzo grabbed the reins, dug his heels in and jerked the horse to a\nstop. He spoke soothingly and rubbed its head, and when it was calm\nenough, he scooped up his weapon and heaved himself into the saddle.\n\nHe felt a grim satisfaction at having killed the Tartars. But it was too\nlate, and not enough. Daoud's brave attempt to finish Charles had been\nsmashed, and the battle was all but lost.\n\nHe must get back to Rachel and Friar Mathieu. If, out of this tragedy,\nhe could rescue Rachel, that at least would be something.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStriking right and left with his saif, Daoud hammered on lifted shields,\non mailed arms, on helmets, on longswords. Few of his blows did damage,\nbut they forced a way for himself and his horse through the ring of\nFrenchmen surrounding Manfred's defenders. Mustached faces, blind with\nfury, thrust themselves at him, and he struck at them with fist and\nshield and sword. He drove his horse into a narrow space between the\nrumps of two huge destriers, pushed them apart like Samson bringing down\nthe temple of the Philistines, and was facing one of his own Sons of the\nFalcon, a dark-skinned man with blood and dirt smeared over his black\nbeard.\n\n\"Ahmad! Make way for me.\"\n\n\"My Lord. I thought you were dead.\" Ahmad nudged his horse to one side,\nenough to let Daoud through, and then with his lance drove back the\nFrench knight who tried to follow him.\n\nPast Ahmad, Daoud looked about and saw that Manfred's surviving warriors\nhad formed a large, irregular ring, facing an ever-increasing press of\ncrusaders. More of Manfred's followers were crowded inside the circle.\nHe saw some men move out and join those fighting the French while others\nfell back and took a brief respite. Many dead men lay on the ground, and\nmany wounded who were too badly hurt to stand. The wounded who remained\non their feet were still fighting.\n\nDaoud saw with a pang of sorrow that there among the dead lay Erhard\nBarth, the landgrave. At least Manfred's marshal had died fighting for\nhis master and would not have to live with the memory of defeat.\n\nThe trampled brown earth within this ring was all that was left of the\nHohenstaufen kingdom. Daoud's anger was deep and weary, at himself for\nfailing and at the fate that had destroyed his hopes today. This\nmorning, he thought, he had imagined himself feeling like Baibars at the\nWell of Goliath. Now he knew how Ket Bogha must have felt.\n\n_Why does God test us so heavily?_\n\nHe looked for the green-plumed helmet he had seen from a distance,\ntelling him Manfred was here. There it was, in the midst of a ring of\nknights with tattered cloaks and surcoats--Manfred's young poets and\nmusicians. It made Daoud's heavy heart feel a little lighter to see that\nthey had stuck by their king. He steered his horse over to Manfred.\n\n\"Emir Daoud! And still on your horse.\" The face under the bronzed helmet\nwas red and shiny with sweat. Manfred's expression and voice were\ncheerful, but Daoud saw a deep, haunting anguish in his eyes.\n\n\"This is my fourth horse of the day, Sire.\" Daoud climbed down and bent\nhis knee to press Manfred's mail-gloved hand against his forehead.\n\n\"I had heard you were killed.\"\n\n\"That new French army that came at noon overran us.\" No need to tell\nManfred, if he did not know, how close they had come to winning. \"Sire,\nwe have enough horses and men to break out of here.\"\n\nManfred shook his head. \"Nothing is left for me except to decide how the\nminnesingers will remember me after this day. To fall in battle will be\nfar better, surely, than whatever shameful end Charles d'Anjou might be\nplanning for me.\"\n\n\"But you need not fall into Anjou's hands,\" Daoud insisted.\n\n\"There is nowhere for me to escape to,\" said Manfred. \"I have lost all\nmy fighting men. All my kingdom lies open to Charles.\"\n\n\"Sultan Baibars would receive you as a revered guest. Or the Emperor of\nConstantinople.\"\n\n_And we could take Sophia there with us._\n\nManfred shook his head with a rueful smile. \"I would be honored to eat\nyour sultan's bread and salt. Or to visit that wonderful city,\nConstantinople. But I do not want to see the shambles Anjou makes of\nthis land my father and I labored so many years to make beautiful.\nAnd--I have been a king, and I do not want to end my life as an exile.\"\n\n_But we are all exiles_, Daoud thought.\n\nManfred continued. \"I thank you for all your help, Daoud. You must get\naway while you still have a chance.\"\n\nTears burning his eyes, Daoud saw that the little space Manfred's men\ndefended had shrunk even as they spoke. He thought of Sophia, waiting\nfor him in Benevento. He thought of El Kahira, of Blossoming Reed, of\ngoing before Baibars and telling him he had failed to stop the alliance\nof Tartars and Christians.\n\nHe would never see any of them again.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and for a moment he sat in the Gray Mosque and heard\nthe voice of Sheikh Saadi.\n\n_The Warrior of God is known, not by his willingness to kill, but by his\nwillingness to die. He is a man who would give his life for his\nfriends._\n\nHe looked again at the short, smiling man before him and said, \"I will\nstay with you.\"\n\nManfred put out a hand. \"Daoud, you owe me no blood loyalty. I do not\nask you to die in my company.\"\n\n\"And yet, but for my advice, you might not be here today,\" Daoud said.\n\"I owe you that. I cannot leave you.\"\n\n\"Many of my own men already have.\"\n\n\"Then I must stay.\"\n\nManfred looked deep into Daoud's eyes. \"What about Sophia?\"\n\nDaoud sighed. \"God knows how much I wish I were with Sophia right now.\nBut she is the most resourceful woman I have ever known, and she has\nfriends with her in Benevento. And I have always known I could never\ntake her back to El Kahira. If I live, there is no other place I can go\nbut El Kahira. It is torment for me to think I will never see her again,\nbut whatever happens to me, Sophia and I would have to part. Perhaps it\nis best that we be parted this way.\"\n\nManfred gripped Daoud's arms hard. \"Stay, then, and be welcome among my\ncompanions.\"\n\n_I have brought destruction and death to so many_, Daoud thought. _Now\nis the time to atone._\n\nThe company and the ground they defended grew steadily smaller as the\nsun sank toward the west side of the valley. Even knowing that every\nmoment he fought was another infinitely precious moment of life, Daoud\nfelt a leaden weariness that made him wish the battle might soon end.\n\nHe struck out with his nicked and blunted saif against yet another\nFrench knight, who seemed fresh and full of vigor while pain screamed in\nhis own shoulders and his legs felt ready to give way under him. But\nthere were no respites now. All Manfred's men still on their feet were\nfighting. All their horses were fled from the field or dead.\n\nDaoud reminded himself that when this battle ended he would be dead, and\nhe thrust upward with his saif to parry a longsword whose arc would have\nended in his skull.\n\nManfred was swinging his sword beside him. By fighting, Daoud thought,\nthey held off, not only their enemies, but the despair that he felt like\na dark tide within him, and that he knew Manfred must feel too.\n\nHe wondered whether Lorenzo had gotten through to the Tartars and killed\nthem. And if he had, would it make a difference?\n\nA French knight with huge mustaches that disappeared under the sides of\nhis helmet swung a battle axe, and the Muslim warrior standing next to\nDaoud was suddenly headless. A spray of blood splashed on Daoud.\n\nHe saw mounted knights pushing through the close-packed mass of shouting\nFrenchmen. One on his right wore a red-painted helmet and brandished a\nmace. On his left rode a knight whose helmet was adorned with some\nfantastic winged animal.\n\n\"Surrender!\" the knight with the beast on his helmet shouted. \"You have\nfought bravely. The battle is over. You will have good terms.\"\n\nDaoud had just time to recognize the face under the helmet with a\nstrange feeling of gladness, as if meeting an old friend.\n\nSimon de Gobignon.\n\n\"Not till I have crushed the viper!\" And that, coming from the red\nhelmet that covered his face, was the deep voice of Cardinal Paulus de\nVerceuil. All in red, he loomed over the struggle like a tower of fire.\nSo hard did he drive his charger through his own French knights that\nsome of them were knocked to the ground. Daoud even saw one fall under\nthe hooves of the cardinal's horse. Others scrambled out of the way.\n\nThe cardinal's war-horse reared up over Manfred, hooves flailing.\nManfred dodged back. The hooves came down, and the charger leapt\nforward. Leaning out of the saddle, holding the mace in both hands, de\nVerceuil brought it down on Manfred's helmet.\n\n\"No!\" Daoud screamed.\n\nHe heard a metallic crash. Manfred collapsed to the ground with a jangle\nof mail and lay still. Blood streaked his yellow and black surcoat and\nsoaked the crushed green plume.\n\nWith a cry of rage Daoud threw himself at de Verceuil to drag him off\nhis horse.\n\nHe was knocked aside by a great gray charger that forced its way\nbetween himself and the cardinal. Staggering back, he looked up into the\nface of Simon de Gobignon.\n\n\"No, Cardinal!\" de Gobignon shouted. \"You will not kill this man, too,\nbefore he has had the chance of honorable surrender.\"\n\nAmazed, Daoud let his saif drop a bit. De Gobignon had ridden in, not to\nattack him, but to save him from de Verceuil.\n\n_But all he accomplished was to save de Verceuil from me._\n\nDe Gobignon, leaning down from his gray charger, pointed his curving\nsword at Daoud, but not in a threatening way. Daoud took a step\nbackward, his saif lifted.\n\nThe struggle around them had stopped. The fighting men had fallen\nsilent. The handful of Manfred's followers remaining were quietly laying\ndown their arms. A German knight and a Saracen crouched weeping over\nManfred's body.\n\nDaoud's arms and legs felt as if he were pushing them through water, but\nhe knew that if he began to fight again he would forget this weariness.\nThe worst of what he felt was the terrible ache of grief in his chest,\ngrief for Manfred, for threatened Islam, for Sophia.\n\n\"Look at him, look at his garb,\" said de Verceuil. \"A Saracen with the\nface of a Frank. If he surrenders, he should be burned as an apostate.\"\n\n\"You must be blind indeed, Cardinal,\" said de Gobignon, \"if you do not\nsee who this is.\" He turned to Daoud with a grave face. \"You are David\nof Trebizond.\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"And are you truly a Saracen? I have long thought that you were an agent\nof Manfred, but I never would have guessed, to look at you, that you\nwere a follower of Mohammed.\"\n\n\"You were meant not to think that.\"\n\n\"This battle--this war--is over now. I give you my word that if you\nsurrender you will be treated honorably. There will be no burning.\"\n\nDe Verceuil boomed, \"Count, you cannot promise that!\"\n\n\"I do promise it.\"\n\nThe two Christian warriors on horseback faced each other, the count in\npurple and the cardinal in red, looking almost as if they might fall to\nfighting.\n\n\"You need not argue,\" Daoud said. \"I will not surrender.\"\n\nDe Gobignon stared at him. \"You will be throwing your life away.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Daoud. \"I am giving my life to God.\"\n\nHe could not help anyone now. Not Manfred, not Baibars, not Sophia.\nLike Manfred, he had only one choice left to him. The manner of his\ndeath.\n\n\"Very well, Messer David,\" said the young count. He swung himself down\nfrom his charger. At his gesture one of his men pulled the horse away.\n\n\"Monseigneur!\" a young man called from the circle of Frenchmen that\nsurrounded them. \"Victory is already ours. Don't risk your life to fight\none God-accursed Saracen.\"\n\n\"I am the Count de Gobignon,\" said Simon quietly, \"because I uphold the\nhonor of my house.\"\n\nDe Gobignon turned to de Verceuil, who still sat on his horse holding\nhis bloody mace in his hand. \"Kindly clear the field, Cardinal.\"\n\n\"I shall see that you have the last sacraments if the infidel kills\nyou,\" said de Verceuil with a curl of his lip. He yanked his charger's\nhead around, drove his spurs deep, and rode off, the circle of men on\nfoot parting for him.\n\nDaoud gazed at the young man before him with a feeling that was very\nlike love. He had once hated Simon de Gobignon. Now he felt him almost a\nson, or a younger brother, or another self. If he had ever wanted to be\nsomeone like Simon, he did not now. He had penetrated such mysteries and\nknown such ecstasies as de Gobignon never would. He had heard and heeded\nthe words of the Prophet, may God commend and salute him. He had served\nBaibars al-Bunduqdari and been taught by Sheikh Saadi and Imam Fayum\nal-Burz. He had fought for Manfred von Hohenstaufen and had loved Sophia\nKaraiannides. And soon he would stand face-to-face with God in paradise.\n\n\"I do not challenge your honor,\" he said.\n\nThe Frenchman was already moving into a combat stance, a slight crouch,\nan exploratory circling of the tip of his sword.\n\n\"But even so I fight for my honor,\" Simon said.\n\n\"It is right that you should know whom you are fighting,\" Daoud said,\nraising his saif. \"I am Emir Daoud ibn Abdallah of the Bhari Mamelukes.\"\n\n\"Mameluke,\" said de Gobignon softly. \"I have heard that word.\"\n\n\"You shall learn what it means,\" said Daoud. He did not want to kill de\nGobignon, but he would if he had to, because the young man deserved\nnothing less than the best fight of which he was capable.\n\nThey moved slowly around each other. Under that purple and gold surcoat\nthe Frenchman was wearing mail armor from his toes to his fingertips. A\ntight-laced hood of mail left only his face bare, and his helmet with\nits nasal bar covered part of his face.\n\nIn this kind of toe-to-toe fight the greater speed of a lightly armored\nfighter was not much advantage. The weight of the mail might slow de\nGobignon down a bit, but fatigue would do the same for Daoud.\n\nThe scimitar de Gobignon wielded, that souvenir stolen from some Islamic\nwarrior, looked to be at least as good a blade as the one Daoud was\nusing.\n\nThe count sprang and slashed at Daoud's arm. Daoud stepped back easily\nand parried the blow.\n\n_He can cut my hand off and that would end the fight. And I might even\nsurvive the loss of a hand to be taken prisoner into the bargain. I must\nnot let that happen._\n\nWith a shout Daoud drove the point of his saif straight at de Gobignon's\nface. Christians used swords for chopping, not stabbing. With a\nbackhanded slash de Gobignon knocked the point aside. He punched with\nhis mailed free hand at Daoud's chest armor.\n\nDaoud felt the force of the blow, but he saw de Gobignon wince. A mailed\nfist could hurt flesh, but when it struck metal the fist would suffer.\n\nDaoud slashed at de Gobignon's sword arm just above the elbow.\n\n_Let us see if that mail can withstand my sword._\n\nDe Gobignon winced again, but the saif rebounded without cutting through\nthe chain links, and Daoud felt a jolt in his gauntleted hand.\n\n_The sword is good, but so is the mail. I cannot cut it or stab through\nit._\n\nDe Gobignon rushed him suddenly, swinging wildly, lips drawn back from\nclenched teeth. Daoud danced away, a part of his mind pleased that he\ncould move so quickly when he had to, tired as he was. De Gobignon's\nwild swings from side to side left his chest exposed. He was relying\nentirely on his armor, Daoud saw, to protect him.\n\nDaoud jabbed de Gobignon under the armpit, so hard that he felt the\nflexible metal of his saif bend. Again the blade failed to penetrate the\ntightly woven chain mail, but de Gobignon gave a gasp of pain and cut\nhis attack short. Daoud was gratified.\n\nHe glimpsed a familiar face in the circle of onlookers, a meaty,\nweather-beaten face with a broken nose. Sordello. Had he been guarding\nthe Tartars on the field today?\n\nDe Gobignon attacked again, swinging his scimitar furiously at Daoud's\nhead. He ended the motion with his arm across his face. Daoud gripped\nhis own sword with both hands, and on de Gobignon's backswing raised it\nover his head and brought it down with all his strength on the\nFrenchman's wrist. The count's arm was moving into the blow, which gave\nit even more force.\n\nThe scimitar flew from de Gobignon's hand. Daoud threw his body against\nde Gobignon's and locked his foot behind his opponent's ankle. His long,\nthin frame top-heavy in his mail, de Gobignon fell over backward. Daoud\nstepped forward instantly. Groans and cries of horror were already going\nup from the Frenchmen in the ring around them.\n\nDaoud planted his leather-booted foot on de Gobignon's chest hard enough\nto knock the wind out of him. He jabbed his saif straight at one of de\nGobignon's few vulnerable places, his right eye, stopping the point a\nfinger's breadth from the pupil.\n\nDaoud and de Gobignon remained frozen that way.\n\n_And now, O God, tell me: What will I do with him?_\n\nA year ago he would have joyfully driven the point of the saif into\nSimon de Gobignon's brain. Even now, he reminded himself that to kill de\nGobignon would relieve Islam of a most dangerous enemy. Daoud would have\nwon the battle for Manfred today, and Manfred would still be alive were\nit not for de Gobignon's unexpected charge. For that alone, the young\ncount deserved to die.\n\nDe Gobignon lay motionless, his face full of anger and defiance.\n\n_But what a waste. I will kill him, the other Franks will kill me, and\nboth of us will be dead. All loss. No gain._\n\nThe sun hurt his eyes. It was low in the west, almost touching the hills\nthat bounded the valley of Benevento.\n\n_Even if I spare him, the Franks will not let me live. For what I have\nbeen, for what I have done to them, they will burn me, as de Verceuil\nsaid, or worse. Could I trade Simon's life for a decent death for\nmyself?_\n\nHe opened his mouth to speak.\n\nA crushing blow to his chest jolted his body, throwing him back. He\nheard the clang of metal punching through his chest armor. An instant\nlater a thunderbolt of pain struck just beneath his ribs and spread\nthrough his body. He cried out in agony.\n\nSomewhere nearby a woman's voice screamed.\n\nHe sank to his knees, dazed.\n\n_What happened to me?_\n\nHe still had his sword in his hand. In his blurred vision he saw de\nGobignon, his mouth open in surprise, sitting up, crawling toward him.\nWarningly, he raised his saif, but the terrible pain in the middle of\nhis body drained the strength from his hand, and the sword fell from his\nfingers to the ground.\n\n_God help me. I have been arrow-shot. I am going to die._\n\nFear worse than he had ever felt turned his body to ice. So total was\nits power over him that the fear became a greater enemy than death\nitself, and he gathered his forces to put it down. After a moment of\nstruggle, though he still quaked inwardly, he began to take command of\nhimself.\n\nDe Gobignon was looking down at him, and his face was full of shock and\ngrief.\n\nSomeone else was standing over him. He saw a pair of leather leggings\ntucked into heavy boots, archer's dress. His head fell back, and he was\nlooking up at Sordello. The bravo squatted down, bringing his face close\nto Daoud's.\n\n\"I am glad to see you still alive, Messer David,\" he said in a soft,\ngrating voice. \"So I can tell you that this repays you for teaching me\nabout paradise.\"\n\nThe pain felt as if rats had burrowed into his chest and were eating\ntheir way out. He wanted to scream, but he managed to smile.\n\n\"Thank you, Sordello. You are sending me to the true paradise.\"\n\nThere was justice in it. He had forced Sordello to undergo the\nHashishiyya initiation. He had always felt that an evil thing to do. Now\nhe was repaid. Just as Sordello said.\n\n_But when I die, God will welcome me._\n\nA hand clamped on Sordello's shoulder and jerked him away.\n\n\"You filthy, stinking, cowardly bastard! You killed the best man on this\nfield.\"\n\nDaoud could not see Sordello, but he could picture the expression that\nwent with the injured tone.\n\n\"Your Signory! I save your life and you call me a bastard? The point of\nhis sword right at your eyeball?\"\n\n\"He was not going to kill me. I could see it in his face.\"\n\nThere was a wild, almost frightened note in Sordello's laughter. \"Can\nYour Signory read men's thoughts? I warrant you, if you had till the Day\nof Judgment, you could not guess what this archfiend is thinking. You\nhave no idea what he has done.\"\n\nDaoud almost managed to laugh. The fool Sordello, as usual speaking and\nacting before he thought. One word more, and he would indeed hang\nhimself.\n\n\"Tell the count, Sordello. Tell him what I have done.\"\n\n_God, I will forgive You for making me suffer so, if You will let me see\nSordello's face just now._\n\nAnd God granted Daoud's wish. Sordello crouched again over Daoud, his\ncolor maroon, his bloodshot eyes popping. It was wonderful, and Daoud\nbreathed a prayer of thanks.\n\nAfter a moment Sordello got control of himself enough to speak. \"You\nknow what you have done. You killed the Tartars.\"\n\nHe straightened up. \"Your Signory, do you not know that John and Philip\nare dead? And it was this man's servant, Giancarlo, who shot them from\nambush with a crossbow on the battlefield. I shot this David of\nTrebizond not only to save your life, but to avenge the Tartars.\"\n\n\"Killed?\" De Gobignon turned away, beating his mailed fist against his\nleg. \"God, God, God! Two years I've kept them alive and Anjou _loses_\nthem!\"\n\nThe count was silent for a long moment. His back remained turned, but\nhis shoulders heaved. He seemed to be sobbing. Daoud glanced at\nSordello, whose eyes glowed with triumphant hatred.\n\n_So, Lorenzo finished the Tartars. At last. I pray only that it is not\ntoo late._\n\nHe felt, not elation, but a quiet satisfaction. He thanked God for\nletting him hear this news before he died.\n\n\"Did you get Giancarlo?\" de Gobignon asked in a quiet, choked voice.\n\n\"No, Your Signory. The battle came between us.\"\n\nDaoud thought, _Thank you, O God, for that_.\n\n\"Go away, Sordello,\" said de Gobignon in that same subdued tone. \"Go\nwhere I cannot see you. I will deal with you later.\"\n\n\"Your Signory, this man is capable of the most unbelievable treachery.\nHe will tell you monstrous lies. In the moments of life he has left to\nhim, God alone knows what evil he may do. I urge you, kill him at once.\nIt is the wisest thing. Here, here is my dagger. Cut his throat. Avenge\nJohn and Philip--and yourself. Or, let me do it for you. Do not soil\nyour hands.\"\n\n_He is terrified of what I might say about him._\n\nIn his dimming vision Daoud saw Sordello lunge at him, holding a long\ndagger. Suddenly he vanished. A moment later Daoud heard a crash.\n\n\"I told you,\" de Gobignon said. \"Get out of my sight.\"\n\nFor a short time Daoud could see no one. He heard movements and\nmurmurings around him. Then he felt a hand slide under his head and lift\nit up. A fresh wave of pain swept through his body, shocking him with\nits force. He thought he had already felt the worst. He cried aloud.\n\n_Soma. In the hour when I need it most, I had almost forgotten it._\n\nHe pictured the mind-created drug collecting in his head and coursing in\na stream of glowing silver down his throat and branching out to all\nparts of his body. Cooling, soothing. Building a wall around the place\ndown low on the right side of his chest where the crossbow bolt had\ndriven into him. A silver globe formed around the pain, and he was able\nto think and speak. He felt that his head was lying on something soft.\n\nKneeling on his left side, de Gobignon said, \"I am sorry I hurt you. I\nfolded my cloak and put it under you to try to make you more\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I feel better now.\"\n\n\"Are you really a--Muslim? Can you talk, or is it too painful?\"\n\n\"I can talk.\"\n\n\"I would be glad to know who and what you really are.\"\n\n\"And I will gladly tell you.\" Daoud began to feel death creeping through\nhis limbs. The pain was sealed off, but he sensed the lower cavities of\nhis body filling up with blood. The crossbow bolt should have gone right\nthrough him, but the rear half of his breastplate must have stopped it.\n\nFear began to rise in him again. Fear, and a desolating sorrow. Never to\nsee Sophia again. Never to do even the simplest things, get up and walk,\nsee, breathe. It was more than he could bear.\n\nHe fought to find his balance.\n\n_I cannot save myself from dying. But I can decide how I will use these\nlast moments of life._\n\nHe wanted to tell this man, who had been his greatest enemy all along,\nhow he had tricked him and how close he had come to thwarting their\ngrand design of an alliance of Christians and Tartars to destroy Islam.\nIt would make up, in a small way, for all today's defeats. For himself,\nthat was all he wanted now. Very soon now, he would go up to paradise.\n\nBut Sophia and Lorenzo, Ugolini and Tilia, would have to struggle on in\nthis world after he was gone. He must protect them.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Simon prompted.\n\n\"My father was the Sire Geoffrey Langmuir of Ascalon,\" he began. \"My\nmother was Lady Evelyn.\" He told de Gobignon of his capture by the army\nof Egypt, his rearing as a Mameluke in a barracks on the Nile. He tried\nto explain what a Mameluke was, and what code he lived by. He told of\nhis acceptance of Islam, his first battles.\n\nAs he spoke, his eyes wandered, and he saw the red sun half hidden by\nthe wooded western hills. He felt the air growing colder, and he\nshivered. The chill was not in the air alone. His arms and legs were\nnumb, as if they were freezing.\n\n\"Give me your cloak, Valery,\" de Gobignon said, and in a moment a red\ncloak was being spread over him.\n\n\"You were at Mansura, where my father fought,\" de Gobignon said.\n\n\"It was a great victory for Islam,\" said Daoud. \"I saw only a little\nfighting. I was very young.\" He told how Baibars had entrusted him with\nmore and more important tasks, even with the killing of Qutuz. And how\nat last, having trained and shaped him over the years, Baibars sent him\nagainst the powers of Europe.\n\n\"Cardinal Ugolini took a Muslim agent into his house? Introduced you to\nthe Holy Father? _The pope himself?_ By God's breath--\"\n\nHe must be careful, and protect his onetime protector. And others. \"It\nwas King Manfred who sent me to Ugolini.\" Daoud managed to laugh. \"Do\nyou think poor Cardinal Ugolini would be mad enough to present me to the\npope if he had known that I was a Muslim--a Mameluke?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said the count. Daoud focused his wandering eyes on the\npale face with its sharp features that hovered over him. De Gobignon's\nmouth was open, working. He was afraid of what Daoud might answer.\n\n\"And Sophia? How much did she know about you?\"\n\n\"She knew nothing. She knows nothing even now. She was more useful to us\nthat way.\"\n\nSophia was probably still in Benevento, waiting for him. Charles's army\nmust be moving on Benevento to occupy it. There would be murder and rape\nand looting there this night. If de Gobignon still believed in Sophia\nand loved her, he would try to protect her.\n\nThere was pain in de Gobignon's eyes. \"Useful to you?\"\n\n\"Yes. We let her encourage you. We let her fall in love with you.\" He\nwatched de Gobignon's color grow warmer, pinker, as he absorbed what\nDaoud was saying. \"Each time she saw you, Ugolini would question her\nafterward, as if worried about her virtue. You told her more than you\nrealized. She told Ugolini more than she realized.\"\n\n\"Did _you_ question her?\" De Gobignon fixed his eyes on Daoud's.\n\n\"I spoke very little with her. I did not want her to suspect me.\"\n\n_Forgive me, Sophia, for denying our love. I do it to save your life._\n\n\"Where can I find Sophia?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you can help her. She is in Benevento. She came with her\nuncle.\" Daoud managed a smile. \"He thought Manfred was going to force\nthe pope to reinstate him.\"\n\n\"Where in Benevento?\"\n\n\"On a narrow street that runs south from the Roman arch. A house that\nhas a statue of an angel conquering a dragon over the door. The only\nthree-story building on the street. She is on the top floor. Get there\nbefore Charles's men do.\"\n\n\"You do care about Sophia.\"\n\n\"She is an innocent woman. I do not want her to be hurt on my account.\"\n\n\"What about the others--your servant Giancarlo, Tilia Caballo?\"\n\n\"They thought I was a merchant from Trebizond serving Manfred as an\nagent.\"\n\n\"And Sordello? He seems to know more about you than he ever told me. It\nis he who killed you. If he deserves to be punished, tell me.\"\n\nThe sky had deepened from blue to indigo. Somewhere nearby a girl was\nsobbing. Daoud wondered if it was she who had screamed earlier, when the\nbolt from the crossbow first hit him. What was a girl doing on this\nbattlefield?\n\n_Does Sordello deserve to be punished? De Gobignon tried to use him\nagainst me, and I had more powerful means to turn Sordello against de\nGobignon. But then the sword turned in my hand. That is not Sordello's\nfault. Let de Gobignon think him innocent._\n\n\"We let him think he was spying on us. Actually, he told you only what\nwe wanted him to tell you. You saw his rage when he realized how I\ntricked him.\"\n\nWith sudden anxiety, he remembered the locket. He reached out with a\nhand that had no strength and put it on de Gobignon's arm.\n\n\"I must tell you one thing. When you go looking for Sophia, do not take\nSordello with you.\"\n\nA man's soft voice overhead said, \"Simon. We have been waiting till most\nof the men moved away. Tell Rachel no one will hurt her if she speaks to\nDavid. She wants to say good-bye to him.\"\n\nDaoud looked up and saw the Franciscan who interpreted for the Tartars.\nHe let his head fall to the side, to see where de Gobignon was looking.\nRachel. Older, more woman than girl now. It had been well over a year\nsince he last saw her.\n\n\"It is safe to come forward, Rachel,\" de Gobignon said. \"We understand\nthat whatever happened, you could not help it.\"\n\nRachel rushed across the intervening space and threw herself on her\nknees at Daoud's right side, reaching out with tentative hands to touch\nhim. Daoud saw that she was afraid that even laying a hand on him would\ncause him pain.\n\n\"You cannot hurt me, Rachel.\"\n\nShe stroked his face, running her hand over his beard. \"Oh, Messer\nDavid!\" Her voice was husky with grief.\n\n\"My name is Daoud, Rachel. I am a Muslim. I have wronged you greatly. I\nbeg your forgiveness. Perhaps this is how God punished me for the sin I\ncommitted against you.\"\n\n\"You wanted to help me. I know you did.\" She sobbed, and he felt the\nweight of her head on the chest armor that had failed him.\n\n\"Your servant Giancarlo--Rachel calls him Lorenzo--helped Rachel escape\nfrom Anjou's camp,\" Friar Mathieu said. \"He left us. He saw Simon's army\ncoming and wanted to warn you. We left the cart and wandered around the\nedge of the battle looking for refuge. We saw your banner here, Simon.\nYou must protect this girl.\"\n\nDaoud reached out to de Gobignon. \"Find Sophia.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu knelt next to Rachel, who moved aside to make room for\nhim.\n\nDaoud said, \"Father, when I am too weak to talk, put your fingers under\nthe collar of my tunic. You will find a small leather packet tied around\nmy neck. Take it off and give it to Rachel.\" He moved his head slightly\nto see Rachel better. \"It is a talisman made by the Sufis, Rachel. It is\ncalled a tawidh. If it would not offend your faith, I would like you to\nhave it as a remembrance of me.\"\n\nRachel laid her hand on Daoud's and repeated the unfamiliar word.\n\"Tawidh. I will treasure it always, and give it to my children.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"I heard what you told Simon about your past. You\nwere baptized a Christian, Daoud. In God's eyes you are still a\nChristian. You must confess that you have sinned, and you must renounce\nIslam before you die, or you will not be saved. Your Christian mother\nand father are waiting for you in heaven. Come, I can give you\nabsolution.\"\n\nDaoud shook his head, smiling. How kind this man was, but how sadly\nmisguided.\n\n\"Saved? Of course I am saved. When a warrior dies fighting in defense of\nthe faith, God welcomes him with open arms into paradise. I do ask your\nblessing. You are a holy man. And I ask your forgiveness for throwing\nyou down those stairs.\"\n\n\"That was you!\" De Gobignon's eyes widened.\n\n\"Of course. I wish I could tell you all the things I have done, good and\nbad. I have had a life of many miracles.\"\n\nDe Gobignon's face hardened. \"You killed Alain.\"\n\nDaoud hoped the realization would not turn de Gobignon against him.\nSophia's life might depend on the count's forgiving him.\n\n\"Have I not admitted that I waged secret war on you in Orvieto? Yes, I\nkilled your friend. I later was sorry I had done it, but he could have\nexposed me. I hurt Friar Mathieu. But I could not kill--a priest. All\nthe things that thwarted you in Orvieto--they were my doing.\"\n\n\"I hate you for those things. For Alain especially.\"\n\n\"The princes of Europe and the Tartars would put countless men, women,\nand children to the sword. They still may do it. That is what I came\nhere to fight against. To save my people.\"\n\nDe Gobignon shook his head. \"How can you feel they are your people? You\nwere not born a Muslim.\"\n\n\"Nor was Muhammad. May God commend and salute him. My faith is the faith\nof the homeless, the uprooted, the exiled. The Prophet said, _Islam\nbegan in exile and it will end in exile_.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu's bearded face and anxious blue eyes seemed to float over\nDaoud. \"You lie there, defeated, dying. Charles has conquered Manfred.\nDoes this not mean that your faith has failed you?\"\n\n\"Whatever God's purpose has been for me, I have accomplished it. God may\ndestroy unworthy bearers of the truth, but the truth He will not\ndestroy.\"\n\n\"Do you think yourself unworthy?\"\n\n\"I hope I have not been. I have tried to be a good slave to God. That is\nwhat the word Mameluke means--slave.\"\n\n_I have wandered in the desert and now I am going to the watering\nplace._\n\nHe wanted to say more, but there was no strength in his breath. The\nsilver globe was cracking like an egg, and a black, irresistible tide of\npain was pouring out.\n\n\"Take the tawidh from around my neck, Father,\" he whispered.\n\nHe felt fingers at his collar, and after a moment the thong slid free.\n\n_Make me to die submissive unto Thee and join me to the righteous. I\nbear witness that there is no god but God and I bear witness that\nMuhammad is His servant and Messenger. Amin!_\n\nHe could not hold the pain back. He could escape it only in sleep. He\ncould not see Friar Mathieu or Simon de Gobignon or Rachel. His eyes\nwere closing. He would dream of Sophia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRachel clutched the leather capsule desperately, as if by holding it\ntightly enough she could keep Daoud alive. She felt her sorrow crushing\nher as if it were a great stone pillar pressing down from the sky. She\ntouched his cheek with her fingertips, and his face felt still as stone,\nand she knew the life had gone out of him.\n\nShe sat back and tied the Muslim amulet around her neck, as she had seen\nit tied around his. Then she dug the fingers of both hands into the silk\nof her gown, near the collar, and pulled at it until it tore.\n\nShe put her hands over her face and let darkness sweep over her mind as\nsobs shook her and her tears fell.\n\n\n\n\nLXX\n\n\nTerror filled the little room like a pool of icy water. Soon, Sophia\nthought, terror would drown them.\n\nThe worst for her was not knowing whether Daoud was alive or dead.\n\n_Before dawn I had him here in this bed. Now after sunset I have no idea\nwhere he is._\n\nSophia lay back on the bed, while Tilia sat on cushions laid over\nSophia's traveling chest. Ugolini sat in an armchair reading--trying to\nread, Sophia suspected--a leather-bound book by the light of a candle in\na brass holder standing on the arm of the chair. Only the yellow gleam\nof the candle and the reddish light of a low fire on the hearth\nilluminated the room. From the shadows along the wall, the icon of Saint\nSimon stared at her.\n\nShe wondered whether she should have spoken to Daoud of what she had\ncome to suspect. Her time of the month, regular as the moon itself since\nshe was a girl, was over six weeks late. It seemed the brew of myrrh,\njuniper berries, and powdered rhubarb Tilia had concocted for her, and\nwhich she had drunk faithfully every morning for six months, might have\nfinally done its work.\n\nShe wanted Daoud to know, though she was not sure whether he would be\npleased. He had never said that he had any children. She wanted to be\nsure she was truly carrying his child before she told him. Tilia had\nadvised her to wait until at least twelve weeks had gone by without an\nissue of blood.\n\nBut now it hurt her that she had not told him. It would have been\nanother parting gift she could have given him.\n\nDarkness had fallen. The foreboding quiet of Benevento was broken by\nshouts in the distance, growing louder as they came closer.\n\nShe heard a scream from the street. A woman's voice, shrill with fear.\nShe shut her eyes and shuddered. Another scream, this time a man's voice\nand full of agony.\n\nSophia's body grew colder. She looked at Ugolini and saw that he was\ntrembling.\n\nIt was not just terror that was making her cold. The fire was burning\ntoo low. She got up and laid two more split logs on it.\n\nBack on the bed, she reached into the neck of her gown and pulled on the\nlong silver chain, drawing out the locket Daoud had given her. She\ntwisted the screw and opened it and stared for a moment at the engraved,\ninterlocking arabesque pattern.\n\nThen Daoud's face superimposed itself, and the pattern disappeared. It\nwas not a picture of him; it _was_ Daoud, as if she were seeing him\nthrough an open window. It was magic, and it frightened her. She had\nnever before encountered magic. His face was alive, though it did not\nmove. His blue eyes seemed to look right at her. She never quite caught\nhim blinking, but it seemed as if he might have, just a moment ago. He\nappeared about to speak to her. Just as the fresh logs on the fire made\nthe room warmer, so her terror subsided at the sight of him.\n\n\"What is that?\" Tilia asked.\n\n\"A keepsake Daoud gave me.\" She closed the hammered silver case and slid\nit back inside the top of her gown.\n\n\"We cannot just sit here,\" Tilia said. \"We are like mice waiting for the\ncat to come and eat us.\"\n\n\"I don't like depending on someone else to save me any more than you,\nTilia,\" Sophia said, \"but all we can do is wait. Someone will come for\nus. Daoud or Lorenzo. Someone.\"\n\n\"We should have left long ago, when the men-at-arms ran away,\" said\nUgolini. \"Then we would have had horses.\" He looked reproachfully at\nSophia. Sophia felt he had a right to. She had persuaded them to stay\nhere. How could she have been so sure that the news that the battle was\nlost, which had thrown the men-at-arms into a panic, was merely a\nbaseless rumor? It was her faith in Daoud, she thought, her certainty\nthat no matter what happened on the battlefield he would come for her\nand take her to safety.\n\n\"Adelberto, you cannot ride very well,\" said Tilia. \"And I cannot ride\na horse at all. You may be sure those poltroons would not have carried\nus on litters. We could not have left then.\"\n\n\"You could ride if your life depended on it,\" said Sophia. \"You may\nstill have to.\"\n\n\"My life depends on _never_ getting on a horse,\" said Tilia. \"I would\nsurely break my neck.\"\n\nThere were more anguished shrieks from somewhere nearby, and they looked\nat each other and the pool of terror rose higher.\n\nSophia heard hoofbeats and men's voices, loud, in the street outside.\nShe went to the door that led out to the balcony and pushed it open a\ncrack. With a clattering of hooves on cobblestones, three mounted men\nrode down the street, looking up at buildings. They carried no torches,\nbut their drawn swords gave off pale glints. There was no way she could\ntell who they were or which side they were on.\n\nThe man in the lead pointed with his sword at the house where Sophia\nwas. She leaned farther out, her heart pounding at her ribs, to see the\ntrio dismount and tie their horses.\n\nShe turned away from the doorway to the balcony and pointed silently\ndownward. Ugolini closed his book with shaking hands. Tilia fingered her\npectoral cross that Daoud had long ago told Sophia contained a poisoned\nblade. And Sophia loosened the mouth of the leather bag tied to her belt\nthat held the tiny crossbow Daoud had given her.\n\nWould she be able to use it? She had shot a longbow for sport a few\ntimes in her life, with indifferent accuracy. But she had never fired\neven a normal-size crossbow. Still, if the darts were poisoned, she need\nnot hit a man in a vital spot to stop him.\n\nSophia heard Scipio barking in the room below, Tilia and Ugolini's room,\nwhere they had tied him. There was, she knew, no one in the house except\nthe three of them. The house belonged to a Guelfo merchant who had fled\ntown when Manfred's army arrived. But she did not hear anyone moving\nabout downstairs, as they would if they were looting the place. Instead,\nheavy footsteps came up the stairs and a voice called, \"Madonna Sophia!\nMadonna Sophia, are you up there?\"\n\nHer heart leapt with relief. It was not yet Daoud, but it must be\nsomeone he had sent. They were rescued.\n\nShe was about to explain the good news to the others when the door to\nthe room swung open. There, grinning triumphantly at her, sword in hand,\nstood Sordello.\n\nHe strode across the room, the floorboards squeaking under his boots,\nand stood facing her. The hound's barking boomed up from below. Her\nheart sank. She had never trusted this man. Her flesh crawled whenever\nhe looked at her.\n\n\"Thank God I have found you, Madonna.\"\n\nTwo men followed him in, dressed in the padded body armor and\nbowl-shaped helmets of crossbowmen. As he did, they carried shortswords.\n\n\"How _did_ you find me, Sordello, and for whom are you fighting?\"\n\nHis back was to the two men who had followed him. He frowned at her and\nshook his head slightly, as if trying to tell her not to say too much.\nBut the little signal did not allay her suspicion of him, and her fear.\n\n\"Why, I am here in the service of Charles d'Anjou, rightful King of\nSicily by decree of the pope,\" Sordello trumpeted. \"And I serve His\nSignory, Count Simon de Gobignon.\" Gloved fists on his hips, he turned\nslowly to gaze around the room.\n\nAt his words, the pool of fear became a flood of terror that threatened\nto sweep her from her feet. She swayed dizzily. This meant the battle\nwas surely lost.\n\n_Dear God, what has happened to Daoud?_\n\nWith a life of their own, her trembling hands pressed against her\nstomach.\n\n\"And look who we have here,\" Sordello said. \"His magical Eminence, the\nvanishing Cardinal Ugolini. And Tilia Caballo, Orvieto's most\ndistinguished brothel keeper, of whose establishment I have such happy\nmemories. Are you two now reduced to being Manfred's camp followers?\"\n\nTilia stared with wide-eyed hatred at Sordello. Ugolini's face was as\nblank as if he had been clubbed. What Tilia had said earlier about cat\nand mouse was apt, thought Sophia. Sordello was tormenting his prey.\n\n_But he could have learned where I am only from Daoud._\n\nIf Daoud had told him where to find her, it must be that Sordello was\nstill secretly Daoud's man, as he had been in Orvieto. That must be what\nthe frown and the headshake meant.\n\n\"You need not glare at me like that, Madama Tilia,\" Sordello said. \"You\nare very lucky to be under my protection tonight.\"\n\n\"What will your protection cost us?\" Tilia's voice was heavy with scorn.\n\nSordello spread his hands. \"Why, whatever your lives are worth to you.\nYou have had much practice putting a price on that which is precious.\"\n\n\"The battle--King Manfred?\" Sophia pressed him.\n\nSordello's grin broadened, showing more stumpy, crooked teeth.\n\"We--Anjou's men--are here in Benevento, are we not? Manfred von\nHohenstaufen is dead. With my own eyes I saw him fall.\"\n\nSophia felt sick to her stomach. Blindly, she staggered to the bed and\nsat down heavily.\n\nA long, high-pitched wail came from Ugolini. He threw his book to the\nfloor and rocked back and forth with his face in his hands. Tilia rushed\nto him and held him.\n\n_Manfred, dead._\n\nSophia's cry of grief was as heart-tearing as Ugolini's, but she kept it\ninside herself. She had loved Manfred once, and even after that was\nover, she had delighted in attending his court and had marveled at the\nfelicity of his kingdom.\n\n_Gone in a day! What a loss, what a waste!_\n\n\"Manfred died in a most chivalrous manner,\" said Sordello, showing no\nsympathy for the anguish he was causing. \"He fought to the end, a few\nfaithful followers beside him, surrounded by enemies. Cardinal de\nVerceuil killed him. I think I will write a poem about it.\"\n\n\"De Verceuil!\" Ugolini cried. \"That pestilence in red robes! If only I\nhad had him poisoned.\"\n\nHad Daoud been one of the faithful who fought beside Manfred?\n\nSophia's throat almost closed with fear as she asked the question. \"What\nof--David of Trebizond?\"\n\nAgain that little frown and shake of the head, aimed at her alone. \"More\nof him later.\" There must be things he did not want to say in front of\nthe two Venetians.\n\nBut she persisted. \"Is he alive? Is he unhurt?\"\n\nSordello nodded gravely, his yellowish eyes holding hers. \"He was alive\nwhen I last saw him, Madonna.\"\n\nShe let out a long breath. The ache of fear in her stomach eased. Even\nif the battle were lost, Daoud would manage to live through it and get\nback to her. Perhaps Sordello was his messenger.\n\nShe felt safer on her feet. She pushed herself up and moved slowly\ntoward the door leading to the balcony outside. Downstairs, Scipio\nstarted barking again.\n\n\"Capitano,\" said one of the archers. \"Are we to stand here talking all\nnight? There is a whole town for the taking here, and we are missing our\nchance.\"\n\n\"Hush, Juliano,\" said Sordello. \"You see before you two very important\nand wealthy followers of the late King Manfred. What they can offer us\nby way of ransom will be far more than the trinkets you could pick up\nraiding some merchant's home.\"\n\n\"Ransom?\" Tilia spat. \"What right does a furfante like you have to\ndemand ransom of me?\"\n\n\"Why, Madama, is that not exactly what scoundrels do?\" Sordello laughed.\n\nHe sat down in the spot Sophia had just vacated on the bed, laying his\nglistening sword ostentatiously across his lap. Sophia saw that he\ncarried a long dagger in a sheath hung on his right side. He surveyed\nthem all, grinning.\n\n_God, this is torture! If only I could find out what has happened to\nDaoud._\n\n\"You have three choices, Madama Tilia,\" Sordello said. \"You may leave\nhere. Outside this house you can take your chances with the victorious\nwarriors of Charles d'Anjou, who have fallen upon Benevento like\nravening wolves. Can you hear the screams? Or you can stay here under my\nprotection, and it will not cost you even one denaro. And in the morning\nI will present you, all legally and properly, to King Charles, who will\nbe most grateful to me for the service. He is exceedingly eager to round\nup all of Manfred's principal servants. Some he is beheading, some he is\nhanging. You, former Eminence, will probably pay at the stake for your\nheresy and witchcraft. As for you, Madama Tilia, if a rope stout enough\nto hang you cannot be found, you may spend the rest of your life\nshedding your excess flesh in a dungeon.\"\n\nUgolini sat hugging himself and shuddering. Tilia opened her wide mouth\nto speak, seemed to think better of it, closed it again. But red coals\nsparkled in her eyes.\n\n_That's better, Tilia. Keep the anger hidden until you can use it._\n\nBut Sophia's fear for Daoud grew again at the thought that he might be\nCharles's captive, awaiting execution. Why would Sordello tell her\nnothing?\n\n\"Has David been captured?\" she ventured, turning from the doorway to the\nbalcony.\n\nSordello smiled at her, just as Scipio downstairs broke into another\nburst of furious barks. In the candlelight, Sordello's face turned a\ndeep orange with sudden anger.\n\n\"Find that damned dog and kill it!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" said Tilia. \"That is Giancarlo's hound, Scipio. We put him down\nin our room to guard our belongings.\"\n\n\"Just what I thought,\" said Sordello. \"That is why I wish him killed.\"\n\n\"But he is a thoroughbred boarhound,\" Tilia went on, \"and since it\nappears Giancarlo has lost him, let him be part of our ransom. He is\neasily worth several hundred florins.\"\n\n\"I have always loathed that dog,\" said Sordello. \"I would gladly kill it\njust to avenge myself on Giancarlo for killing the Tartars.\"\n\nIn the midst of her terror Sophia felt a stab of surprise. \"The Tartars?\nDead? Giancarlo killed them?\" Did that mean Rachel was free?\n\n\"Yes,\" growled Sordello. \"And if I find him, I will personally repay him\nby cutting him to bits, starting at his toes. For that and for the many\nother injuries he has done me. But Madama Tilia is right. The hound is\ndoubtless worth too much money to kill. I will take it, then.\" He\ngestured to his two men. \"Have these two display their possessions for\nyou. Do not harm the dog. Or them, for that matter. I want them back\nhere intact when you are done, so I know I am getting an honest\ninventory.\"\n\n\"I do not know whether we can satisfy you,\" said Tilia. \"We did not\nbring everything we own with us. If you would help us get to Lucera, we\ncould make you princely rich.\"\n\nSordello leaned back and crossed his legs. \"But Lucera is far from here,\nand there may not be time for us to collect what you have there. In a\nfew days King Charles will unleash his locusts and scorpions far and\nwide throughout this land--his bailiffs and judges and clerks and tax\ncollectors and men-at-arms--to lay hold of every speck of gold and chip\nof precious stone. For now, please help my men collect what you have\nwith you. I am sure you have plenty. That cross on your handsome bosom,\nfor instance. I suspect a man might buy himself a small castle with\nthat.\" He reached out, and Tilia stepped back, but into the grip of one\nof the archers.\n\nTears sprang from her eyes and trickled down her painted cheeks. \"Please\nlet me keep it just a little longer. If I must part with it, in the end\nI will, but it is very dear to me.\"\n\nSordello waved grandly. \"For now, then. Go now with these fellows. And\nmind you, hold nothing back. They are Venetians. You can't hide anything\nvaluable from a Venetian.\"\n\nIndeed, thought Sophia, remembering tales of how the Venetians had\nlooted her beloved Constantinople years ago. As she watched the\nshuffling Ugolini and the dauntless Tilia leave with Sordello's two men,\nshe felt her knees trembling so hard under her gown that she could\nbarely stand.\n\nShe would be alone with Sordello.\n\n\"Be wary of the dog,\" Sordello called after his archers. \"But be careful\nnot to hurt it.\"\n\n\"S\u00ec, capitano.\" The door closed with a thump.\n\n\"And now, Sophia,\" said Sordello, lifting the sword from his lap and\nlaying it carefully on the bed, \"we settle accounts.\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean by accounts,\" said Sophia, making her voice\nas cold and forbidding as she could. \"But before anything else, the\ntruth, if you can manage it. I have seen you serving Simon, and I have\nseen you serving David, and now you say you are on the side of Charles\nd'Anjou. Who do you truly serve?\"\n\nSordello stretched his booted legs and crossed them, leaning back in the\nchair. \"Myself, Andrea Sordello, of course. Men may command part of me,\nbut only I own all of me. In the beginning I was to serve Simon,\nreporting secretly to Anjou. In Orvieto David was my master. He offered\nme--a rich reward. But then he threatened to kill me. I fled Orvieto,\nfollowing Simon. After that I was mostly Simon's man. A little bit\nDavid's man. I sent him information from Perugia and Viterbo, and he\nsent me money. But first, last, and always, my own man.\"\n\n\"Why are you here, then?\" Sophia let her hand rest on the door handle as\nif she might rush out on the balcony and call for help. She hoped\nSordello would expect her to do that rather than try to use a weapon on\nhim.\n\nSordello stood up, smiling. \"Madonna, you are not aware how I have\nsuffered because of you. Suffered with longing. You owe me much for\nthat.\" He strolled over to the fire, picked up a big log from the pile\nnext to the hearth, and set it on the burning wood.\n\n_Oh, may God shrivel his phallos!_ Sophia felt her stomach burn at the\nidea of this repulsive man lusting after her. She turned quickly, facing\nthe balcony door, so that he could not see her grope in the bag at her\nbelt for the tiny crossbow and the box of darts Daoud had given her. How\nquickly, she asked herself, could she take the crossbow out, get a\npoisoned dart from the box without scratching herself, load it, draw the\nbow, aim and shoot?\n\n_He could be across the room and tearing the thing out of my hands\nbefore I got all that done._\n\nHelplessness made her tremble.\n\nHaving made sure of the location of crossbow and darts, she turned to\nhim again, gripping the skirt of her gown to hide the shaking of her\nhands. \"If you find me attractive, I am flattered, of course, but it is\nno fault of mine.\"\n\n\"You do not wish to escape from Benevento? You wish to be turned over to\nKing Charles's judges?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to fear from them.\"\n\nHe bared his broken teeth. \"Do you think they will have trouble finding\nsomething to accuse you of? Not if I tell them what I know.\" Then he\nraised a finger. \"It was David of Trebizond who told me where to find\nyou. And you keep asking about him. I always suspected, when I was\nserving David at Cardinal Ugolini's, that there must be something\nbetween you two.\"\n\n\"If there is any spark of mercy in you at all, do not play with me like\nthis. Tell me if he is alive.\"\n\nShe wanted to seize him by the arm, but she was afraid to get too close\nto him.\n\nThe light of the one candle in the room cast shadows like black blots on\nSordello's grinning face. \"Play with you? Ah, but if there is a spark of\nmercy in _you_, then you will play with me. _Then_ I will tell you\neverything you want to know. Being alone with you like this, I burn so\nwith desire, I would do anything, good or evil, to possess you.\"\n\nScipio's thunderous barks, bursting out suddenly, made her jump. She\nheard male voices cry out, alarmed, then Scipio's rumbling snarls. Then\nsilence.\n\nSordello glowered at the floor. \"God's beard! I almost hope they did\nkill that brute.\"\n\nTo distract him a little longer from herself, Sophia said, \"You had\nbetter hope Scipio does not hurt _them_.\"\n\n\"What do I care if they suffer a few bites? The dog is worth more than\nthey are.\" He looked up at her. \"Do you know anything about journeys to\nparadise?\"\n\n\"I do not know what you are talking about.\" Was that a name for some\ncarnal pleasure he wanted to have with her?\n\n\"Come away from that balcony door,\" Sordello said.\n\n\"The air is fresher here.\" From the street she heard swords clanging,\nmen screaming and cursing, and hooves pounding. There was fighting\nnearby.\n\n\"Our French friends, quarreling over their loot,\" said Sordello. \"Do you\nstand by the balcony door because you fancy being rescued from _me_ by\n_them_? They are animals, like that dog downstairs. What I feel for you\nis far more profound than the desire to rape some conquered woman. I am\na trovatore, after all. I will prove it to you. Just let me see you\nunclothed. Like Mother Eve. I will not touch you. Undress yourself, and\nI will tell you what you want to know about the man called David.\"\n\nShe wanted to spit in his face. She was desperate to know what he could\ntell her, but even if he did tell her about Daoud, how could she put any\ntrust in him? If Daoud was alive he would find his way to her, or she to\nhim. She had nothing to gain by cooperating with Sordello.\n\n\"You disgust me!\" she cried. \"I wish you were not even able to see my\nface, let alone the rest of me.\" And she turned away from him, her hand\ndipping into the leather bag.\n\nShe heard his heavy footsteps thudding on the wooden floor. And another\noutburst of barking from below.\n\n\"I wanted you to give yourself to me willingly,\" Sordello said. \"But if\nyou refuse me, I will take you. And while I am doing it, I will tell you\nabout the man David.\"\n\nTerror seized her and shook her as if she were a rag doll. The way that\nfilthy pig said that--it must mean something bad had happened to Daoud.\nShe felt paralyzed by fear and grief.\n\nThen, sudden rage made her want to strike out at this man who was\nhurting her so. She had the box of darts open now. She must be very\ncareful of the poisoned tips.\n\nThe door to the room crashed open.\n\n\n\n\nLXXI\n\n\n\"Sophia!\"\n\nShe dropped a loose dart back into the bag and turned.\n\nSimon de Gobignon stood in the doorway, staring at her. The firelight\nmade his dirt-streaked face glow. His surcoat was ripped, showing the\nmail underneath, and she saw dark stains on the purple and gold. He was\nsplashed with blood, she thought, her stomach churning. His head was\nbare, his mail hood thrown back and his mail collar open. He held his\nhelmet, adorned with the figure of a winged heraldic beast, under his\narm.\n\nAt first sight of him she felt a glow of joy. Simon lived. And she was\nsafe from Sordello. Triumphantly she glanced over at the bravo and felt\neven better at the sight of his scarlet color, his clenched jaw, the\nswollen veins throbbing in his temples.\n\nThen suddenly it came back to her that Simon was an enemy too.\n\n_It has always been too easy for me to forget that._\n\nShe would have to face his questions, his accusations, his pain, his\nrage. She felt like a bird in flight suddenly struck by an arrow and\nplummeting to earth.\n\nAnd a worse thought struck her, piercing her heart like a sword. What\nwas it that Sordello would have told her about Daoud? In God's name,\nwhat terrible thing had happened to him?\n\nSimon's being here meant he, too, must have learned where she was from\nDaoud. Where, then, was Daoud?\n\nShe saw figures in the shadows outside the door, one white-haired and\nwhite-bearded, the other a small woman wearing a mantle over her head.\n\nSimon took a few steps into the room, his mail clinking. She could tell\nby his movements that he was exhausted. She felt a surge of pity for\nhim, at what he must have done and suffered. She reminded herself he had\nbeen fighting against Manfred and Daoud, on the side of Anjou. Still,\nshe felt sorry for him.\n\n\"What the devil are you doing here?\" Simon said, glaring at Sordello,\nhis voice crackling with anger.\n\n_Why so much hatred_, Sophia wondered.\n\n\"You wanted me to be gone, Your Signory, and it seemed most useful for\nme to come here. It occurred to me that important followers of the\ninfidel Manfred might be here. And, indeed, on the floor below you will\nfind his agents Tilia Caballo and ex-Cardinal Ugolini, being questioned\nby my men.\"\n\n\"And you were _questioning_ this lady. Before God, I do not know what\nkeeps me from running you through.\" His mailed hand reached across his\nwaist to grip the hilt of his sword.\n\n\"Easy, Simon,\" said the white-haired man. He came into the room now, and\nSophia recognized Friar Mathieu, the Tartars' Franciscan companion.\n\nShe looked past the elderly priest and saw who was with him.\n\n\"Rachel!\"\n\nIn the midst of her fear and sorrow, Sophia felt an instant of\nmiraculous happiness, as if the sun had come out at midnight.\n\nShe rushed across the room holding out her arms, and the girl flew into\nthem.\n\n\"Rachel, what a joy to see you!\"\n\n\"Oh, Sophia! Sophia!\"\n\nRachel was crying, but not for joy. She was sobbing heartbrokenly. What\nhad happened to her?\n\n\"How do you come to be with Count Simon?\" Sophia asked, hoping that\nanswering would calm Rachel.\n\nBut Rachel went on weeping into Sophia's shoulder, and Friar Mathieu\nspoke for her. \"Rachel and I fell in with Count Simon, and we thought it\nsafest to stay with him. And he chose to come here.\"\n\n\"It's all right now,\" Sophia said, patting Rachel's back as she held her\nin her arms. \"Everything will be all right.\"\n\n\"No, Sophia, no.\" Rachel, it seemed, could not stop crying. Bewildered,\nSophia looked up. Friar Mathieu and Simon were standing side by side in\nthe center of the room. Sordello, his face working with barely\ncontrolled fury, had moved to a far corner. His sword still lay on the\nbed, Sophia noticed, but his hand was on the hilt of his dagger.\n\nSimon and the Franciscan were looking, not at Rachel, but at Sophia.\n\n\"David told you I was here,\" Sophia said. \"He must have.\"\n\nIn an instant, she understood why Daoud had told Simon where to find\nher. And why Rachel kept weeping and weeping.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" she asked.\n\nThey answered her with silence.\n\nA wave of dizziness came over her. She reeled, and Rachel was holding\nher up. Friar Mathieu took her arm, and they lowered her into the\narmchair. She knocked the candle to the floor, putting it out. Now the\nonly light in the room was the red glow of the fire.\n\nShe felt empty inside.\n\n_I am mortally wounded_, she thought. _I feel now only a shock, a\nnumbness. The pain will come._\n\nThe only reason Daoud would tell Simon where to find her had to be that\nhe was dying and wanted Simon to protect her. Daoud truly must be dead.\n\nSimon's anguished look, as if he were begging for something, confirmed\nit. But to be sure, she had to hear it.\n\n\"Has David been killed?\"\n\nSimon nodded slowly, his eyes huge with pain. \"I was with him when he\ndied. I even know now that he is not David but--Daoud.\" He hesitated,\npronouncing the unfamiliar name.\n\n_I was with him when he died._\n\n_Daoud!_\n\nShe wanted to scream, but she hurt so much inside that she could not\neven scream. She could not make a sound.\n\nDaoud was _gone_. She had seen him, she had spoken to him, she had loved\nhim for the last time.\n\nBut she _had_ to see him again. Her cold hand fumbled at her neck,\npulled the locket up from her bosom by its silver chain. She turned the\nscrew that opened it and stared at the spirals and squares.\n\nNothing happened. The pattern, to her eyes a jumble of shapes\nrepresenting nothing, remained inert.\n\nEven his likeness was gone.\n\nHow had he died? She looked up at Simon to ask him.\n\nAnd then she did scream.\n\nSordello crouched in the semidark behind Simon, his two-edged dagger,\nreflecting red firelight, poised horizontally to slash Simon's\nunprotected throat. His eyes glittered. His mouth shaped a slack-lipped\nsmile, as if he were drunk, baring his gleaming, broken teeth.\n\nSordello seemed not even to notice her scream. Without a sound, unseen\nby the other three, who were all staring at Sophia, he raised his left\narm to seize Simon and his right hand to strike with the dagger.\n\nSophia's hand dove into the bag at her waist. The loose dart could\nscratch her, and a scratch might be enough to kill her, but that did not\nmatter. Her fingers found the dart. She wrapped her fist around it and\nflung herself out of the chair, straight at Simon.\n\nSimon tried to fend her off, but she darted under his hands, twisted\naround him, and drove the dart into Sordello's throat. Blood spurted\nover her hand.\n\nSordello seemed neither to see her nor to feel the dart. His eyes stayed\nfixed on Simon's neck. He slashed at Simon. But Sophia's lunge had\npushed the two men apart. Sordello's blade scratched Simon's neck just\nunder his right ear. Then it fell from the bravo's fingers.\n\nSordello, the dart still hanging from his throat, staggered backward,\nhis knees buckling. His body folded, and he lay sideways on the floor.\n\nThe four living people in the room were as still as the dead one. Then\nSimon touched his fingertips to his neck and winced. Sophia saw a\nrivulet of blood running down into his mail collar.\n\nFriar Mathieu tore away a piece of the bedsheet and dabbed Simon's wound\nwith it. He took Simon's hand as if he were a puppet and pressed his\nfingers against the rag to hold it in place. Then he knelt over\nSordello's body and whispered in Latin.\n\nWhimpering, Sophia stumbled back to the armchair where she had been\nsitting. A sob forced itself up from her chest into her throat. She felt\nRachel's gentle hands helping her to sit down. Another sob came up,\nshaking her body. Another followed it, and another. She lost touch with\neverything around her for a time, buried in a black pit where neither\nsight nor sound nor even thought could penetrate. She was lost in\nwordless, mindless grief.\n\nThen, gradually, she began to hear murmurings, voices.\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"She saved your life.\"\n\nSimon said, \"I know. David--Daoud--told me not to take Sordello with me\nif I went looking for Sophia. As if he knew this might happen. How could\nthat be?\"\n\nRachel was sitting on the arm of the chair, gently stroking Sophia's\nshoulder.\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"Why would Sordello try to kill you? Because he was\nabout to rape Sophia when you interrupted? Or because he was afraid you\nwould punish him for killing--Daoud?\"\n\nAmazement jolted Sophia's body. She opened her eyes and stared at Friar\nMathieu.\n\n\"_Sordello_ killed Daoud?\"\n\nSimon answered her. \"I will tell you how he died. I must talk to you. I\nhave waited more than a year, you know, to see you again.\"\n\nSobs still shook her, but she nodded and wiped her face with the sleeve\nof her gown. He reached down. She took his arm, and he helped her up.\nShe saw that he had a bloodstained strip of linen tied around his neck.\n\n\"The balcony,\" she said.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nAs she went to her chest to get her cloak, Sophia looked at the icon of\nthe saint of the pillar and thought how much, even though it had Simon's\nname, the expression looked like Daoud's.\n\nSimon held the door to the balcony for her. The night was cold and\nmoonless. The bitter smell of burning floated on the freezing air. The\nshouts of frenzied soldiers and the agonized screams of men and women\nseemed to come from everywhere. Fires blazed in all parts of the town,\ntheir glow and smoke turning the night sky a cloudy reddish-gray. On the\nplain to the north, campfires twinkled. Somewhere out there Daoud lay\ndead.\n\nShe looked up at Simon. Darkness hid his face. The ruddy glow of burning\nBenevento haloed his head. In a quiet, even voice he told Sophia how he\ncame upon Daoud fighting side by side with Manfred, and how he fought\nwith Daoud after Manfred was killed. How he lay helpless with Daoud's\nsword pointed at his face.\n\n\"He did not move for a long time,\" Simon said. \"It was growing dark, but\nI saw the look on his face. A gentle look. He did not want to kill me. I\nam sure of it.\"\n\nAnd then without any warning had come the treacherous crossbow bolt out\nof the circle around them, and Daoud had fallen.\n\n\"It was Sordello. He could not understand my rage at him. He kept\nprotesting that he had saved my life. He had not.\"\n\nSophia thought of Sordello's attempt to seduce her. She clutched the\nwooden railing, choking bile rising in her throat.\n\n\"I am glad I killed him,\" she whispered. \"I have never killed anyone\nbefore tonight. That I killed him was a gift from God.\"\n\nSimon did not answer at once.\n\nThen he said, \"Tonight, before Daoud died, he told me that you were\ninnocently drawn into his conspiracy against the alliance. He said he\ntook advantage of my love for you, and that you and he were never close.\nBut now that you've heard he is dead, you are like a woman who has lost\na husband or a lover.\"\n\nHe stopped. He needed to say no more. She knew what he was asking.\n\nThe enormous aching void inside her made it almost impossible to think.\nDaoud, even as he lay dying, had tried to protect her. Simon might have\nsuspicions, but about who she was or what she had done, he knew nothing.\nManfred was dead. Tilia, Ugolini and Lorenzo--wherever they might be\nnow--would say nothing.\n\nShe could, if she chose, become the person Simon thought she was--the\nperson who had given herself to Simon in love at the lake outside\nPerugia. She need only seize the chance Daoud had given her.\n\nIn all Italy there was no place for her now. Once again she belonged\nnowhere and to no one. And she could be a wife to this good young man.\nShe could be the Countess de Gobignon, with a station in life, with\npower to accomplish things, to change the world.\n\n\"You want to know what Daoud meant to me,\" she said. \"Did you tell him\nwhat I meant to you?\" She was amazed at how level her voice sounded.\n\n\"I think he knew,\" Simon spoke just above a whisper. \"I did not feel I\nhad to tell him anything.\"\n\nThen Daoud had died not knowing that she and Simon had for a moment been\nlovers. Did it matter? If Daoud had known, perhaps he would have killed\nSimon instead of just standing over him with his sword.\n\nHis not knowing had not hurt Daoud. But it was hurting her.\n\n_There was a part of myself I withheld from him. And that was my loss,\nbecause much as he loved me, he did not know me fully._\n\nBut if she regretted not telling Daoud the truth about that single\nmoment, how could she ever bear to hide from Simon the truth about her\nwhole life?\n\nCould she pretend, forevermore, to be Sophia Orfali, the naive Sicilian\ngirl, the cardinal's niece, with whom Simon had fallen in love? Could\nshe pour all of herself into a mask? Could she live with Simon, enjoying\nthe love and the wealth and power he offered her, knowing that it was\nall founded on a lie?\n\n_No, never. Impossible._\n\nThe pain of Daoud's death was nearly unbearable, but it was _her_ pain,\ntrue pain. Ever since that night of death in Constantinople--a night\nmuch like this--she had not felt at home in the world. Now she saw her\nplace. All she owned in the world was the person she _really_ was, and\nwhat she _really_ had done. If she deceived Simon, she would have to\ndeny her very existence.\n\n_And I would have to deny the greatest happiness I have ever known, my\nlove for Daoud._\n\nIf she lied to Simon, it would be as if Daoud had never been. It would\nbe like killing him a second time. Her heart, screaming even now with\nher longing for Daoud, would scream forever in silence. Buried alive.\n\nSimon must already suspect the truth. He might try to believe whatever\nshe told him about herself. Still, some awareness of his self-deception\nwould remain with him, even if he refused to think about it. It would\nfester inside him, slowly poisoning him.\n\nHer eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and she could see the suffering\nin Simon's long, narrow face as he waited for her answer. Starlight\ntwinkled on the jeweled handle of the sword at his belt. What she told\nhim might make him hate her so much that he would kill her.\n\n_I have never been more willing to die._\n\n\"Simon, I promised you that when I saw you again I would tell you why I\ncould not marry you. I hoped I never would have to tell you.\"\n\nHe said, \"I had not wanted to fight in this war of Charles against\nManfred, or to bring the men of Gobignon with me. When I found that you\nhad fled to Manfred's kingdom, I changed my mind.\"\n\nHer pain had been like a pile of rocks heaped upon her, and what he said\nwas the final boulder crushing her. Her ribs seemed to splinter; her\nlungs labored for breath.\n\n_So I must bear the guilt for Simon's coming to the war. How many men\ndied today because of me?_\n\nShe could hardly feel more sorrow, but the night around her seemed to\ngrow blacker. Perhaps it would be best if he did kill her. She would\ntell him everything straight out, without trying to protect herself from\nhis anger.\n\n\"My name is Sophia Karaiannides. I worked as a spy in Constantinople for\nMichael Paleologos and helped him overthrow the Frankish usurper. I was\nMichael's concubine for a time. Then he sent me to be his private\nmessenger to Manfred's court here in Italy. Manfred chose to make me his\nmistress. But that became difficult for him and dangerous for me. When\nDaoud came to Manfred asking for help in thwarting the Tartar alliance,\nManfred sent me along to Orvieto to help him. I fell in love with\nDaoud.\"\n\nSimon leaned his long body against the outer wall of the house. Having\nto hear this all at once must be overwhelming.\n\n\"So you went from one to bed to the next as you went from one country to\nthe next.\"\n\nIt hurt her to hear his words, his voice tight with pain, but she had\nexpected this.\n\n\"Daoud and I did not come together as man and woman at first,\" she said.\n\"He did not want to be close to me.\"\n\nHe staggered back to the edge of the balcony as if she had struck him,\nand she was afraid he might fall.\n\nHe whispered, \"Not at first! But you did--\"\n\n\"Yes, we did,\" she said, thinking, _Now he is going to draw that\nscimitar and kill me_.\n\nBut the only movement he made was a slight wave of his hand, telling her\nto go on.\n\n\"I must tell you, Simon, that it was I who first fell in love with\nDaoud. There were moments when I hated him--when he killed your friend,\nfor instance--but as I got to know him better and better I could not\nhelp loving him. I had been loved by an emperor and a king, but I had\nnever met a man like Daoud. He had begun as a slave, and he became\nwarrior, philosopher, poet, even a kind of priest, all in one\nmagnificent person. You probably have no idea what I am talking about.\nYou knew him only as the merchant David of Trebizond.\"\n\n\"I knew you only as Sophia Orfali.\"\n\n\"You may despise me now that you have learned so much about me, but the\nmore you knew of him, the more you would have had to admire him.\"\n\n\"How insignificant I must have seemed to you beside such grandeur.\" She\ncould hear him breathing heavily in the darkness, sounding like a man\nstruggling under a weight he could not bear.\n\n\"I did love you, Simon. That was why I cried when you said you wanted to\nmarry me. The word love has many meanings. And your French troubadours\nmay call it blasphemy, but it _is_ possible for a woman to love more\nthan one man.\"\n\n\"Not blasphemy. Trahison. Treachery.\"\n\n\"As you wish. But in that moment you and I shared by the lake near\nPerugia, I was altogether yours. That, too, is why I fled from you. I\ncould not stand being torn in two.\"\n\n\"Why torn in two, if you find you can love more than one man?\" The hate\nin his voice made her want to throw herself from the balcony, but she\ntold herself it would ease his suffering for him to feel that way.\n\n\"I said it was possible. I did not say it was easy. Especially when the\ntwo men are at war with each other.\"\n\n\"And did Daoud know about me? Did you tell him what you and I did that\nday?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, finding it almost impossible to force the words through\nher constricted throat. \"I could never tell him.\"\n\n\"So you could not admit to this _magnificent_ man, this philosopher,\nthis priest, that you had betrayed him with me.\"\n\n\"No,\" she whispered. \"He was jealous, as you are. At first he wanted me\nto seduce you. But as he came to love me--I saw it happening and I saw\nhim fighting it--he came to hate the idea of letting you make love to\nme. He came to hate you, because of that, and because he envied you.\"\n\n\"Envied me?\"\n\n\"Yes. He saw you as one who had all that he never had--a home, a\nfamily.\"\n\nSimon stepped forward and brought his face close to hers. \"Did you tell\nhim about my parentage?\"\n\n\"No, never.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" His voice was bitter. \"Was that not the sort of thing you\nwere expected to find out? Could he not have found a way to use it? Were\nyou not betraying your war against us--what do you Byzantines call us,\nFranks?--by withholding it?\"\n\n\"I told you that loving you both was tearing me apart,\" she said\nhelplessly.\n\n\"But you loved him more--that is clear.\"\n\n\"Yes. I loved him more because he knew me as I was, and loved me as I\nwas. You loved me, and it broke my heart to see how much you loved me.\nBut you loved the woman I was pretending to be. Now that you really know\nme, you hate me.\"\n\n\"Should I not? How can you tell me all this without shame?\"\n\n\"I am not ashamed. I am sorry. More sorry than I can ever say. But what\nhave I to be ashamed of? I am a woman of Byzantium. I was fighting for\nmy people. Surely you know what your Franks did to Constantinople. Look\nand listen to what Anjou's army is doing tonight to Benevento.\"\n\n\"Daoud spoke that way as he lay dying,\" Simon said slowly.\n\nA sob convulsed Sophia. It was a moment before she could speak again.\n\n\"I hope, at least, you understand us--Daoud and me--a little better,\"\nsaid Sophia. \"Kill me now, or hang me or burn me tomorrow. As I feel\nnow, death would be a relief.\"\n\n\"I know how you feel,\" said Simon. \"I, too, have lost the one I loved.\"\n\n\"Oh, Simon.\" She felt herself starting to weep again, for Simon and\nDaoud both.\n\n\"What do you want to do?\" he asked.\n\n\"What does it matter? I am your prisoner. And Rachel. And Tilia and\nUgolini. All of us.\"\n\nShe remembered the hope she had been harboring these past few weeks. If\nshe died now, would another life within her die? If she lived, how would\nshe care for that life?\n\nHe sighed. \"For me this is all over. If I hurt you, what good would that\ndo me now? It would be just one more unbearable memory to carry with me\nthrough life. One more reason to hate myself. I want to know, if you\nwere free to do as you wish, what would you do?\"\n\nHer mind, numbed with sorrow, was a blank. With Daoud dead, the\nremainder of her life seemed worthless to her. Even the thought that she\nmight be carrying Daoud's child seemed only added reason for sorrow.\n\n\"Now that all of Italy is in the hands of Manfred's enemies, I suppose I\nwould go back to Constantinople,\" she said. The thought of returning\nhome to the city she loved was a faint light in the blackness of her\ndespair.\n\n\"For my part, I would not stop you from going,\" he said. The weary\nsadness in his voice stung her.\n\nIf he meant it--and he seemed to--she should be relieved. Overjoyed,\neven. But all she felt was the weight of her grief, pressing pain into\nthe very marrow of her bones.\n\n\"What do you mean to do about Tilia Caballo and Ugolini?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am sure King Charles wants them, but I do not care to be the one who\ndooms them by turning them over to him.\"\n\n_King Charles._ The title sounded so strange. That was how the ones who\nsupported him must speak of him, of course. And her heart wept a little\nfor Manfred, whom she had not thought of in her agony over Daoud's\ndeath.\n\nShe heard the note of disdain toward Charles in Simon's voice and\nwondered at it.\n\n\"You will not deliver Charles's enemies to him? After coming here and\nhelping him win his war? Have you turned against him?\"\n\n\"Gradually--too gradually, I am sorry to say--I have come to see that\nCharles d'Anjou was not the great man I once thought him to be. When I\nlearned that John and Philip were killed, that killed any remaining\nfeeling I have for Charles. So I will help you if I can. But where can\nyou all go? All of southern Italy and Sicily will be overrun with\nAnjou's men. I cannot keep you, and you cannot safely leave me.\"\n\n\"Let us go back to the others,\" said Sophia. \"It will be best if we talk\ntogether about this.\"\n\nShe could hardly believe he was serious about letting her escape. Her\npain-wracked mind was unable to come to grips with what was happening to\nher. How she needed Daoud! He would know what to do. As she entered the\nfirelit room her eyes blurred with tears.\n\nBut she saw at once that there were more people in the room than when\nshe had gone out on the balcony with Simon.\n\nOne of them was holding a crossbow leveled at Simon. Her heart stopped.\nThen she recognized him, and she let her breath out in relief. Black and\nwhite curly hair, graying mustache, broad shoulders. Lorenzo.\n\nShe heard a growling. Scipio stood there, held tightly on a leash by\nTilia. Ugolini was beside her.\n\nRachel hurried to Sophia and took her hand. \"I'm glad you are back. I\nwas frightened for you.\"\n\n\"Simon wants to help us,\" said Sophia, taking Rachel's hand. She could\nnot give up in despair, she thought, while she had Rachel to care for.\n\n\"You took long enough to come in off that balcony, Count,\" Lorenzo said.\n\n\"Put down your crossbow,\" Sophia said. \"Count Simon has decided to be a\nfriend to us.\"\n\n\"I would not regret giving our new friend just what _my_ friend Daoud\ngot today from his man Sordello,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nTilia said, \"Do you--know, Sophia? About Daoud?\"\n\nHolding herself rigid against this fresh reminder of her grief, Sophia\nsaid only, \"Yes.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"Lorenzo, the man who killed Daoud lies there--on\nthe floor. No need to talk about revenge.\" He pointed to a corner of the\nroom where Sordello's body lay.\n\nNeeding a moment's relief from her pain, Sophia said, \"Lorenzo, how did\nyou ever get here?\"\n\nStill holding the crossbow pointed at Simon, Lorenzo spoke without\nlooking at her.\n\n\"After I got Rachel and Friar Mathieu out of the French camp, I saw\nthis fellow's army charging down from the hills to attack Daoud and his\nFalcons.\" Lorenzo shook the crossbow.\n\nSophia prayed that he would put the crossbow down. What if by accident\nhe unleashed a bolt at Simon? If Simon were to die before her eyes, that\nwould surely be more than she could bear.\n\n\"I had to try to warn Daoud,\" Lorenzo said. \"I left Rachel and the friar\nthere and rode off. I never did reach Daoud.\" He hesitated a moment,\neyeing Simon, then smiled, a hard smile without warmth or mirth.\n\n\"I got your precious Tartars, though, Count Simon.\"\n\nSimon nodded, his eyes bitter. \"Sordello told me it was you who killed\nthem.\" He took a step toward Lorenzo, who shook the crossbow at him\nagain.\n\n_Put it down!_ Sophia wanted to scream.\n\n\"Yes. That worm-eaten spy of yours told you, eh?\" Lorenzo jerked his\nhead in the direction of Sordello's body. \"He was trying to guard them\nat the time. He did a bad job of it.\"\n\n\"M\u00e8re de Dieu!\" was all Simon said. Anger reddened his face, but he was\nlooking off into space, not at Lorenzo.\n\n\"After that,\" Lorenzo went on, \"I found the wagon, but Rachel and Friar\nMathieu were gone. I found another riderless horse and hitched it up,\nand I drove the wagon into the forest west of here. Rachel, I buried\nyour chest. I hope I remember where.\n\n\"By then it was nightfall. I used my forged safe conduct to get me back\ninto Benevento. Then I had to dodge the mobs of drunken Frenchmen\nrunning wild all over town. I knew where you were staying, Sophia, but\nit took me all night to get into this house past Count Simon's guards. I\nspent hours in hiding and scrambling about on rooftops.\"\n\n\"I thought I would die of fright,\" said Tilia, \"when Lorenzo came\nthrough our window.\"\n\n_Thank God for Lorenzo! How I love him. Nothing can stop him. Nothing\ncan kill him._\n\n\"What were you planning to do with these people when you came here,\nCount?\" Lorenzo said. \"Turn them over to your master, Anjou?\"\n\nSophia turned to look at Simon. He stood composed, his empty hands at\nhis sides, his face, pink in the glow from the fire, calm as a statue's.\n\n\"_Your_ master--Daoud the Mameluke--asked me to come here,\" Simon said.\n\n\"_Please_ put your crossbow down, Lorenzo,\" Sophia said again.\n\n\"Are you sure, Sophia? This crossbow might be the only thing that keeps\nus from getting dragged off to be hanged. This high-horse bastard has\nfifty men outside.\"\n\nGreek Fire blazed in Sophia's brain.\n\nShe screamed, \"Do not call him a bastard!\"\n\n\"Sophia!\" said Simon wonderingly. \"Thank you!\"\n\nShe stood trembling, but almost as soon as the words flew from her\nmouth, the fit of rage passed.\n\n_I must be going mad._\n\nBut she had done no harm. She seemed to have made things better.\n\n\"Forgive me, Count.\" Lorenzo laid the crossbow on the bed. \"It was rude\nto call you that. But you did ruin our hope of victory today. Daoud had\nthe battle won. He almost had his hands on your bloody Charles d'Anjou,\nwhen you charged out of the hills with your damned army. And now the\nking I served for twenty years and my good friend are both dead.\" He\nrubbed the back of his hand across his eyes. \"That was hard, Count. Very\nhard.\"\n\n_So it was Simon's charge that turned the battle_, Sophia thought. _And\nit was because of me that he entered this war._ Her grief grew heavier\nstill.\n\n\"You may hold those things against me,\" said Simon, \"and I might hold\nagainst you the deaths of John and Philip, whom I dedicated my life to\nprotecting.\"\n\nListening to that grave, quiet voice, Sophia realized that Simon no\nlonger seemed young to her. It was as if he had aged many years since\nshe had seen him last.\n\nAs long as she had known him, she had thought of him as a boy. And yet,\nfrom what she was hearing, if Charles d'Anjou was now king of southern\nItaly and Sicily, it was to Simon that he owed the crown.\n\n\"But I know who really killed the Tartars,\" Simon went on. \"It was\nCharles, Count Charles, now King Charles, who no more wants to make war\non Islam than your friend Daoud did. Charles kept the Tartars with\nhimself and away from King Louis, and he let them go out on the field\nwhile the battle was raging, no doubt hoping they would die.\"\n\nLorenzo frowned. \"You mean Charles used me to get rid of the Tartars?\"\n\nSimon nodded. \"He could not have known it would be you, but he made sure\nthey would be in harm's way. Charles is very good at using people. My\nmother warned me about him long before I let him persuade me to come to\nItaly to guard the Tartars, but I did not listen. But now, how are we\ngoing to get all of you safely out of Benevento?\"\n\nHe kept coming back to that, Sophia thought. He seemed determined to\nsave them from Charles d'Anjou's vengeance.\n\n\"We may still have the wagon I hid out in the forest,\" Lorenzo said.\n\"And if you truly mean to help us, you might appropriate a horse or two.\nThere are many horses hereabouts whose owners will never need them\nagain.\"\n\n\"I can write you a genuine safe-conduct that will get you past Charles's\nofficials and agents,\" Simon said. \"If you travel quickly enough, you\nmay get ahead of them into territory still friendly to you. There may be\nno army left to oppose Charles, but it will take him some time to get\ncontrol of all the territory he has won. Where might you go?\"\n\nSophia took Rachel's hand again, and they sat on the bed. Remembering\nthat she and Daoud had shared this bed last night, Sophia felt the\nheaped stones of sorrow weigh heavier still.\n\n_I will never hold him again._\n\nTo distract herself from her pain, she tried to listen to what people\naround her were saying.\n\n\"To Palermo first,\" said Lorenzo decisively. \"At a time like this, with\nthe king gone, every family must fend for itself. I want to get to mine\nat once.\" He turned to Rachel, and his mustache stretched in one of the\nsmiles Sophia had seen all too rarely. \"My wife, Fiorela, and I would be\nhonored to have you as a member of our family, Rachel.\"\n\nRachel gave a little gasp. \"Truly?\"\n\n\"Truly. I have been wanting to propose it for a long time.\"\n\nAgain Sophia thanked God for Lorenzo. She almost wished he would offer\nto take her into his family too.\n\nSimon stared at Lorenzo. \"You are--were--an official at Manfred's court,\nand your wife's name is Fiorela?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned. \"Yes, Count. What of it?\"\n\nSimon's interest puzzled Sophia. Could there be some connection between\nhim and Lorenzo?\n\n\"We must speak more about her later.\" Simon flexed his mail-clad arms.\n\"It will not be safe for you to try to leave Benevento until morning. I\nwill see to it that my men guard this house from the looters till then.\nThey will not, of course, know who is in here with me. Meanwhile, you\nall had better sleep, if you can.\"\n\nWeary and broken by sorrow though she was, Sophia knew that to try to\nlie down in the dark would mean nothing but hours of suffering. She\nwould sleep only when she fainted from exhaustion. And she dreaded the\nagony she would feel when she woke again and remembered what had\nhappened this day.\n\nTilia cleared her throat politely. \"Your Signory, it will be hard to\nsleep in the same room with dead bodies.\"\n\nSimon frowned. \"Dead bodies?\"\n\n\"Well--I hope you will not hold it against myself and the cardinal--but\nbesides Sordello here, there are two of his henchmen in the room we have\nbeen occupying.\"\n\n\"Also dead?\"\n\n\"Also dead. They were trying to rob us.\"\n\nNow Sophia remembered that Sordello had brought two Venetians with him,\nand she remembered the barks and growls that had come up through the\nfloorboards while she was alone with Sordello. What had happened down\nthere between Ugolini and Tilia and Sordello's men? And Scipio?\n\nSophia looked at Tilia and noticed that she wore a small smile of\nsatisfaction and was fingering her jeweled pectoral cross.\n\n_I need not worry about Tilia_, she thought grimly.\n\nSimon sighed. \"There must be a basement in this house, a root cellar,\nsomething of the kind. Lorenzo, you and I will find a place to take the\nbodies.\"\n\nThe room grew cold with Sophia and Rachel alone in it, and Sophia put\nmore logs on the fire, thankful that the merchant who had hurriedly\nvacated this place had left plenty of wood. She lay down in the big bed\nbeside Rachel.\n\nHesitantly, Rachel told Sophia that she, with Friar Mathieu, had been\npresent at Daoud's death. She showed Sophia the little leather capsule,\nand Sophia, remembering the many times she had seen it around Daoud's\nneck, broke into a fresh storm of weeping.\n\nRachel held it out to her. \"I think perhaps you should be the one to\nhave it.\"\n\n\"No. He gave it to you.\" Sophia wiped her eyes, drew out the locket and\nopened it, looked sadly at the meaningless tracery of lines on its\nrock-crystal surface, barely visible in the light from the low fire.\n\n\"This locket is what he gave me. It seems the magic in it died with him,\nbut it is a precious keepsake.\" She remembered that she had been looking\nat the locket when Sordello tried to kill Simon. Why had he tried to do\nthat? It made no sense, but because of it she had killed Sordello, and\nof that she was glad. She had avenged Daoud.\n\nDesperately needing to know every detail of Daoud's death, Sophia\nquestioned Rachel until, in the middle of a sentence, the girl fell\nasleep.\n\nSophia lay wide awake in the dark, crying silently. Lying there was\nhell, as she had expected it would be. After what seemed like hours, the\nfire on the hearth died. She got up and piled three bed carpets over\nRachel.\n\nShe wrapped herself in her winter cloak and slipped out of the room.\nGoing, she knew not where, but unable to remain still. Wanting only to\ndistract herself from her pain with a little movement.\n\nShe went down the stairs, passing the silent second-floor room were\nUgolini and Tilia lay. She heard men's voices from a room on the ground\nfloor.\n\nThe cabinet of the merchant who owned this house was just inside the\nfront door. There Sophia found Simon and Lorenzo seated facing each\nother at a long black table. Scipio, lying on the floor near the\ndoorway, opened one eye, twitched an ear at her, and went back to sleep.\nWith a quill Simon was writing out a document, while Lorenzo used a\ncandle flame to melt sealing wax in a small brass pitcher on a tripod.\n\nSimon gave her a brief, sad smile. He had taken off his mail, and wore\nonly his quilted white under-tunic.\n\nLorenzo stood up, went to a sideboard, and poured a cup of wine. Silent,\nhe handed it to Sophia. It was sweeter than she liked, but it warmed\nher.\n\nShe took a chair at the end of the table. The two men sat there so\ncompanionably that it was hard to believe that for more than two years\nthey had been enemies. She recalled with a pang how Daoud had said he no\nlonger hated Simon. If only he could be here to be part of this.\n\n\"One cannot predict these things,\" Lorenzo said, continuing the\nconversation that had begun before Sophia arrived, \"and I certainly do\nnot believe in trying to make them happen, but my son, Orlando, is at a\ngood age for marriage. And so is Rachel.\"\n\nSimon looked up from his writing. \"You would let your son marry a woman\nwho had spent over a year in a brothel?\"\n\nLorenzo gave Simon a level look. \"Yes. Do you disapprove?\"\n\nSimon shook his head. \"From what I know of Rachel, not at all. But there\nare many who would.\"\n\nKnowing Lorenzo Celino, Sophia thought warmly, she was not surprised\nthat he did not feel as many other people would.\n\n\"Rachel is brave, intelligent, and beautiful,\" said Lorenzo. \"What\nhappened to her was not her fault. And now she knows infinitely more of\nthe world than most women. If she should take an interest in Orlando,\nhe would be lucky to have her. And then Rachel will be your cousin,\nCount Simon. She will surely be the only Jewish girl in all Europe who\nis related--if only by marriage--to a great baron of France.\"\n\nSophia frowned at Lorenzo. Cousin? What was the man talking about?\n\nRaising his head from his scroll, Simon saw her look and smiled. \"I have\njust discovered, Sophia, that Lorenzo Celino here is my uncle.\"\n\nSophia felt somewhat irritated. Were the two of them playing a sort of\njoke on her?\n\n\"No, it's true, Sophia,\" said Lorenzo. \"My wife came from Languedoc\nyears ago as a refugee from the war that was being fought there at the\ntime. Her maiden name was Fiorela de Vency. And her older brother,\nRoland de Vency, went back to France and eventually married Simon's\nmother, making him Simon's stepfather. So you see, I am Simon's uncle by\nmarriage.\"\n\nSimon smiled broadly. \"Roland told me long ago that he had a sister\nFiorela who was married to a high official of Manfred's. I would far,\nfar rather have you for an uncle, Lorenzo, than Charles d'Anjou, whom I\nhave often called Uncle.\" He gave Sophia a meaningful look.\n\nShe understood. Simon might like Lorenzo, but not well enough to tell\nhim that Roland de Vency was more than a stepfather to him, and\ntherefore Lorenzo's wife more than an aunt by marriage.\n\n_Only his mother and father and his confessor know that, he once said._\n\n_And I._\n\nWeighed down with grief though she was, she managed to smile back.\n\nSimon put down his quill, closed the lid on the ink pot, and blew on the\nparchment to dry it. He poured red wax at the bottom of the sheet, took\na heavy ring off his finger, and pressed it into the blob. He handed the\ndocument to Lorenzo to read.\n\n\"You have been well educated,\" said Lorenzo. \"You write as handsomely as\na monk.\"\n\n\"Charles will have his men out looking for you, as one of Manfred's\nministers,\" said Simon. \"I advise you not to wait for them to catch up\nwith you in Palermo. Of course, Charles may offer you a chance to work\nfor him. The help of men acquainted with Manfred's regime will make it\nmuch easier for him to take over.\"\n\nLorenzo's mustache twitched as he smiled sourly. \"Work for him? I know\nyou do not know me well, but I hope you jest. Otherwise I would have to\nconsider myself insulted. Manfred and his father, Emperor Frederic,\nbuilt a fair and civilized land here. Learning and the arts of peace\nflourished, unchecked by superstition. Charles will doubtless destroy\nall that. I propose to make it very hard for him to hold on to what he\nhas conquered this day. Anjou will not thank you if he learns it was you\nwho turned me loose.\"\n\n\"See that he does not learn it, then.\"\n\nLorenzo frowned. \"You won the battle for Charles. Now you seem willing\nto do him all sorts of mischief.\" He leaned across the table and fixed\nSimon with his piercing, dark eyes. \"Why?\"\n\nSophia leaned forward, too, eager to hear Simon's answer.\n\nSimon sighed and smiled. \"Because today at last I saw through Charles's\ndouble-dealing with me in the matter of the Tartars.\" His smile was a\nvery sad one. \"And I want to help you, out of what I still feel for\nSophia.\"\n\nSophia felt the tide of sorrow rise again within her. Her mouth trembled\nand her eyes burned. Simon was looking down at the table now, to her\nrelief, and did not see her response to his words. He might have been\nlooking away, she thought, to hide the tears in his own eyes.\n\nLorenzo stood up briskly. \"I am going to try to find an empty bed or a\nsoft carpet for a few hours' sleep. Tomorrow we leave early, and we\ntravel far.\"\n\nAfter he and Scipio had gone, Simon said, \"I loved you. At least, I\nloved a woman who had your face and form, but did not really exist.\nAgainst my will, I have asked myself, since I saw you again tonight, if\nthere is any way that dream of mine could be salvaged. Have you thought\nabout that?\"\n\nSophia shook her head. In her heart there was room for nothing but pain.\n\nShe said, \"Just as you wish you had not been the cause of Daoud's death,\nso I wish I had not hurt you so. But that is all I can say. Simon, a\ndream may be very beautiful, but it is still only a dream.\"\n\n\"I suppose we are lucky that we can sit here and talk about it, you and\nI, and that we are not trying to kill each other.\"\n\n\"That is not luck, that is because of who we are. Simon, one thing hurts\nme very much. I do not know what happened to Daoud after he died. Is\nthere any way I could--see him?\"\n\nHis eyes big and dark with sadness, he shook his head. \"Even if you\ncould, the body of a man dead many hours, of wounds, is a terrible\nsight. And then that would be your last memory of him. You would not\nwant that. _He_ would not want that. And if you went near the bodies of\nManfred's dead, you would be in great danger. Someone might recognize\nyou. Remember that many who served Manfred will be eager to get into\nCharles's good graces. You must protect yourself.\"\n\nShe did not care about protecting herself.\n\n\"What will happen to Daoud? What will they do to him?\"\n\nShe realized she was still talking of Daoud as if he were alive. She\ncould not bear to speak of \"Daoud's body.\"\n\n\"The men who died fighting for Manfred will be buried on the\nbattlefield,\" said Simon. \"They cannot be buried in consecrated ground\nbecause those who were Christians were excommunicated under the pope's\ninterdict. And many, like Daoud, were Saracens. I believe King Charles\nis planning some special honor for Manfred's body.\"\n\nManfred's body. Hearing those words, the enormity of what had been lost,\nbeyond her own sorrow, came home to her.\n\nAnd what of Daoud's spirit, she wondered. Did she believe that a part of\nhim was still alive? Had he gone to his Muslim warrior's paradise? If\nshe were carrying his child, would he want her to raise it as her own?\nShe realized that she was crying again. How could her eyes produce so\ngreat a flood of tears?\n\nShe heard footsteps and felt Simon's hand resting lightly but firmly on\nher shoulder. She dropped her head to her arms, folded on the table, and\ngave herself up to sobbing.\n\n\n\n\nLXXII\n\n\nSimon, carrying the heaviest rock he could hold, walked in procession\ndirectly behind Charles d'Anjou. They came to the low wooden platform\nwhere the body of Manfred von Hohenstaufen lay, covered by his great\nyellow banner with its black double-headed eagle. Charles set his foot,\nin a handsome purple boot, on the banner, and leaned over the body with\na large stone.\n\n\"Requiescat in pace. May you rest in peace, Manfred von Hohenstaufen.\"\n\nCarefully Charles set the rock down on the banner-draped figure and\nstepped back with a small smile of satisfaction.\n\n\"Now you, Simon.\"\n\nSimon stepped onto the platform. His arms, stiff and sore from\nyesterday's fighting, ached as he lifted the stone to place it. He laid\nit next to Charles's rock on the inert, hidden form and stepped back.\n\nGautier du Mont of the bowl-shaped haircut was next. He bowed to Charles\nand Simon and put his rock beside theirs.\n\n\"Simon, come with me,\" said Charles. \"We have had no chance to talk\nsince yesterday.\" He led Simon to a small nearby hill, where they could\nwatch the long line of Charles's army winding single file through the\ngray valley of Benevento under an overcast sky. Each man, by Charles's\norder, carried a stone to lay on Manfred's cairn.\n\n\"If not for you, Manfred would be burying me today, Simon,\" said\nCharles, his large eyes solemn. \"I am in your debt forever, for my\nkingdom and my life.\"\n\n_That should make this a bit easier for me._\n\n\"Thank you--Sire.\"\n\nDu Mont and FitzTrinian, Fourre and de Marion, laid their stones as\nCharles and Simon watched. The Burgundian, von Regensburg, had been\nkilled yesterday, impaled on a Saracen foot soldier's spear. Simon felt\nlittle regret at his passing.\n\n\"We are burying Manfred as our pagan ancestors were buried,\" said\nCharles, \"but I hope this gesture of respect helps reconcile his former\nsubjects to me. I fear trouble with them. It has already started. Last\nnight, after the battle, several men died mysteriously.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Simon.\n\n\"The death that shocked me most was de Verceuil's.\"\n\nSimon was amazed. \"The cardinal?\" He could hardly believe it. He\nremembered de Verceuil's departure just after the cardinal had killed\nManfred, as Simon and Daoud were beginning their final combat.\n\n\"Poisoned,\" said Charles. \"I do not know if it was done by Manfred's\nfollowers or by an enemy of his in our own ranks. You had not heard?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nEven though one expected to hear, after a battle, of untimely deaths,\nSimon's blood ran cold with shock. De Verceuil did not seem the sort to\noblige his fellow men by dying unexpectedly.\n\nA cold wind blew across Simon's neck and whipped the bright purple\nwoolen cloak Charles was wearing. Charles touched his hand to his gold\ncrown, larger than the count's coronet he had worn on state occasions in\nthe past, as if fearing that it might blow away.\n\n\"He went to the Tartars' tent looking for them before we learned they\nhad been killed,\" Charles said. \"Saw a jar of wine on the table. He was\nthirsty after the fighting, and took a long drink straight out of the\njar. Those who saw him said that in an instant his skin turned hot and\nred. First he cried out that he was blind, then he raved about terrible\nvisions and began laying about wildly with his mace, so that his\nattendants were forced to flee. Then he went into convulsions, and\nwithin the hour he was dead.\"\n\nSimon remembered Lorenzo saying something about having gone to the\nTartars' tent.\n\n_He was going to make doubly sure he killed them this time. Instead, he\nkilled Manfred's killer._\n\n\"A tragedy,\" Simon said, sorry that, despite the duty of Christian\ncharity, he could feel no sorrow.\n\n\"Then there was Sordello, your captain of archers who guarded the\nTartars. Did you not hear about him?\"\n\n\"He has not been under my command since I left the Tartars with you in\nRome,\" said Simon. He kept trying to think about de Verceuil and prayed\nthat his face would not give away his knowledge of how Sordello died.\n\n\"He and two of his men were found this morning in a building in town.\nSordello had a small puncture in his throat, and one of the others had\nbeen stabbed in the chest with a very thin blade. One of my\npriest-physicians looked at the bodies and believes both of them were\nkilled with poisoned implements. And it appeared the throat of the third\nhad been torn out by the fangs of some enormous beast.\"\n\n\"Perhaps a watchdog,\" said Simon. \"After all, when troops are turned\nloose on a town, one must expect that a few of the citizens will fight\nback.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to lose Sordello,\" said Charles. \"A despicable man, but\noften useful.\"\n\nThe rocks covered Manfred's body completely now. Only the edges of the\nyellow banner were still showing. Those who had placed their stones\nstood around in groups to watch the cairn grow.\n\n\"These Sicilians will not settle down until the remaining Hohenstaufens\nare out of the way,\" said Charles. \"Manfred has three sons and a\ndaughter. I have to find them and lock them up. Too bad I cannot have\nthem executed, but they are just children.\"\n\n_Children!_\n\nSimon prayed that Manfred's children escaped from Charles.\n\nHe stood facing Charles, knowing that he was as tall as the new king of\nsouthern Italy and Sicily and that he no longer felt afraid of him.\nFighting in this battle, his near-death at Daoud's hands, the shock and\npain of what Sophia had told him--all together, these things had changed\nhim. He no longer doubted that he deserved to be the Count de Gobignon.\nIt did not matter who his real father was. What mattered was that there\nwas no one else in the world who could rule Gobignon as well as he. In\nthe past two years he had become the Count de Gobignon in truth as well\nas in title. And now all he wanted was to go back to his domain.\n\nTo bring up the subject, Simon said, \"Friar Mathieu is most grieved at\nthe deaths of the Tartar ambassadors, but it means you no longer need\nhim here. He has asked me to take him back to France with me. He has\npermission from his order to go. He wants to tell King Louis in person\nabout his journey among the Tartars. And he wants to spend his remaining\nyears in France. As for me, I am eager to see my mother and stepfather\nin Provence.\"\n\n_Now that I can face them with a clear conscience._\n\nCharles frowned, throwing his head back and staring down his long nose\nat Simon. \"You want to go back to France now? But our work here has only\nbegun.\"\n\n\"If you wish to offer any of my vassals fiefdoms or positions in your\nnew kingdom, they have my leave to accept. I promised them that when\nthey came with me.\"\n\n\"But you cannot leave before taking possession of your own dukedom.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sire. But I have decided that for myself I want nothing.\"\n\nHe had rehearsed that sentence in his mind a hundred times. He was\ndelighted at the sound of it and even more delighted at the stupefied\nexpression on Charles's face. It was not often one surprised a man like\nCharles d'Anjou.\n\n\"_Nothing?_ But that is preposterous. You have come all this way, won\nthis great victory--has your head been addled by chivalrous romances?\nThis is not the world of Arthur and Lancelot.\"\n\nSimon recalled Manfred's last stand on the field yesterday and thought,\n_Perhaps that world ended with him_.\n\nSurely Charles, keeping himself well out of the battle and threatened\nonly when Daoud desperately tried to reach him, had been no figure out\nof chivalric romance. This was a man he could not trust, could not\nadmire, and especially could not like.\n\n\"Too true, Sire. But it is a world in which people need decent rulers. I\ndo not need more land, and the land I already have needs me. If I divide\nmyself between a domain in northern France and another one here in\nItaly, I cannot govern either well. And, frankly, I do not want to live\nin the midst of a strange people as a foreign conqueror.\"\n\n_Giving up this dukedom, too, gives me a better right to be Count de\nGobignon._\n\n\"You overestimate the difficulty of governing,\" said Charles.\n\n_No, you underestimate it_, thought Simon. For Charles governing was a\nsimple matter of squeezing the people and their land for all they were\nworth. And killing anyone who protested, as he had those citizens\noutside Rome. If the people were strange to him, all the easier to\noppress them.\n\n\"Perhaps what comes easily to you is difficult for me, Sire,\" he said.\n\nCharles shook his head, then quickly reached up to steady the heavy\ncrown. \"I do not understand you. But that province is too valuable for\nme to press it on someone who does not want it. I can use it to reward\nothers who have served me, not as well as you have, but well enough.\"\n\n\"I hoped you might see it that way.\"\n\n\"But think, since I asked you to guard the Tartars--it has been nearly\nthree years--you have taken part in great affairs and you have added to\nyour reputation and restored luster to your family name. You have led\nyour Gobignon vassals to a victory that has brought them glory and\nriches. You have, I tell you again, won my lifelong gratitude. Why\nseparate yourself from all that now? By what you did yesterday you wiped\nout the stain on your family name. Your father betrayed his king and his\ncrusader comrades, but now you have won a victory for a crusade and\nsaved the life of a king.\"\n\n_Yes, but how different those crusades, and how different those kings._\n\nHe kept reminding himself that Manfred was an enemy of the pope and\nDaoud an enemy of Christendom, but the thought haunted him that through\nhim great men and a noble kingdom had fallen. Again and again he tried\nto push out of his mind the idea that he had been wrong to come here and\nfight on the side of Anjou. But he knew it would remain with him,\ntroubling him, for the rest of his life.\n\n\"If you want to show gratitude to me, Sire, the one favor I ask is that\nyou not press me to stay.\"\n\nCharles fumbled in a heavy purse at his belt and drew out a long silver\nchain. He held it out to Simon.\n\n\"Here. I want you to have this, at least.\"\n\nSimon bowed gravely and held out his hand. Attached to the chain was a\nfive-pointed star with a large, round ruby in its center.\n\n\"Beautiful. Thank you very much, Sire.\"\n\n\"It was Manfred's. He prized it highly, I am told. Called it his 'star\nof destiny.' You earned it, I think, by giving me victory yesterday. I\nhope it brings you a better destiny than it did him.\"\n\nUneasily, feeling that the star was property stolen from a dead man,\nSimon took it. He unbuckled the purse at his belt to drop it in.\n\n\"Put it on,\" Charles urged.\n\nReluctantly, Simon hung the star around his neck.\n\n\"I will treasure it,\" he said tonelessly.\n\n\"It is little enough. If you will only consider staying with me, you\nwill share in spoils that will make that look like a trinket. City by\ncity I am going to take over not just this kingdom but northern Italy\ntoo. I will unite all of Italy. The Papacy will be solidly under French\ncontrol. And then Constantinople. I bought the title of Emperor of\nConstantinople from Baldwin II when he fled to Paris after Michael\nPaleologos deposed him.\"\n\nThe name of Michael Paleologos was like a blow to Simon's stomach.\nProbably it was no more than a name to Charles, but Simon could hear\nSophia saying she had been that same Michael's concubine for a time. He\nsuffered again as he had last night when he stood with her on the\nbalcony of that house and she told him at last the truth about herself.\nHe had felt then as if he were drowning in a lake of fire. And added to\nhis own anguish had been the realization that her pain, the pain of the\nwoman he had loved and still loved, had been worse than the worst of\nwhat he felt.\n\nCharles was still going on about his accursed ambitions.\n\n\"I mean to make that title a reality. Not since Rome will so many lands\naround the Middle Sea have been united in one--empire.\"\n\nThe vision moved Simon, but not as Charles evidently hoped. It sickened\nhim, and he felt himself in the presence of a monster. Had Charles\nforgotten already the heaps of corpses strewn on this battlefield at\ndawn, that only now were being hauled away by the wagonload?\n\nSimon remembered the long list of the Gobignon dead that Thierry had\nhanded him this morning on his return to camp. He thought of the\nhorribly wounded knights and men he had visited, men who, if God was\nkind to them, would be dead in a day or two. His eyes still burned from\nall the weeping he had done this barely begun day.\n\nAnd this man, who had made the rescue of the Holy Land, the defeat of\nIslam, and the alliance of Christians and Tartars seem all-important to\nhim, now spoke of sacrificing thousands and thousands more lives\nentrusted to him so that he could realize his dream of being another\nCaesar.\n\n_God grant that he does not get what he wants._\n\nThe wind from the north blew steadily down the length of the valley. The\npile of rocks over Manfred's body had grown so high the men now had to\nthrow their stones to reach the top.\n\n\"What of our plans to liberate the Holy Land, Sire? What about the\nalliance of Tartars and Christians? That is what I gave the last three\nyears of my life to. Surely that is not dead because John and Philip had\nthe ill luck to get killed on this battlefield.\"\n\nCharles pulled his purple cloak tighter around him against the wind.\n\"The timing is wrong for an attempt to retake the Holy Land. I have no\nintention of taking part in a crusade against the Egyptians, with or\nwithout the Tartars.\"\n\nThere it was. Charles had confirmed what Simon suspected about him. He\nfelt indignation boiling within him, but he tried not to let it sound in\nhis voice.\n\n\"Sire, why did you let the Tartars go into the battle yesterday and lose\ntheir lives?\"\n\nCharles's eyes narrowed. \"I know what grief you must feel, having\nguarded them so carefully for so long. But they insisted. They had\nfought against Christians. So now they wanted to see how a battle looks\nfrom our side. They knew the risks. They had been warriors all their\nlives. They were my guests, and I had to let them do what they wanted.\"\n\nSimon looked out at the valley. The line of men carrying rocks to\nManfred's cairn stretched far into the distance, disappearing finally\nbeyond the crests of rolling fields. The line still looked as long as\never. It wound past a long, narrow mound of freshly turned brown\nearth--the mass grave dug at dawn by prisoners for the dead of Manfred's\narmy. The man called Daoud--Simon still thought of him as David--who for\nmore than two years had fought Simon relentlessly, lay somewhere under\nthat mound of earth. The man Sophia had loved.\n\nNear at hand the soldiers who had added their rocks to the pile were\ndismantling Manfred's camp. Tents collapsed in flurries of colored\ncloth.\n\n_All these fighting men. And King Louis could have added twice as many\nto these. What could they not have accomplished if they had invaded\nPalestine at the same time a Tartar army struck at the Saracens from the\neast?_\n\nHe decided to probe further. \"Now there can be no planning for a\ncrusade--until the next ambassadors come from Tartary. Is that your\nwish?\"\n\nCharles smiled. \"Oh, eventually we will want to make war on the\nSaracens. After Italy is united, after the Byzantine Empire is ours once\nmore. Toward that day, we want to maintain the bonds of friendship with\nthe Tartars. If they send us more ambassadors, we will treat them\nroyally and shower them with fair words.\"\n\n\"And send them home with nothing,\" Simon added.\n\n\"For now,\" Charles agreed. \"For now, instead of planning war with Egypt,\nI believe it is more in my interest to do as the Hohenstaufens did when\nthey ruled Sicily--cultivate friendly relations with the Sultan of\nCairo.\"\n\nSimon was silent for a moment, amazed that Anjou could be so open about\nhis lack of principle. He felt his face grow hot and his voice quiver as\nhis anger forced its way to the surface.\n\n\"Everything you have done and said has been for one purpose only, to\nmake yourself king of Sicily. I guessed as much, and now I know. And\nthat is why I do not want a dukedom in your kingdom. Because I do not\nwant to be used by you anymore.\"\n\nCharles drew himself up and fixed Simon with an angry stare. \"Curb your\ntongue, Messire! You may be the Count de Gobignon, but you owe me the\nrespect due a king.\"\n\n\"You are not my king, thank God,\" Simon retorted. \"My king, your\nbrother, King Louis, taught me that each and every man and woman on\nearth is precious to God. That a king's duty is to care for his people,\nnot use them as if they were cattle.\"\n\n\"A good philosophy for the next world,\" said Charles scornfully.\n\n\"It is the philosophy by which your brother rules in this world,\" said\nSimon fiercely. \"And that is why everyone loves him. Not just his own\nFrench subjects, but all Christians.\"\n\nCharles's olive skin darkened to a purple shade. \"Consider this,\nMessire--when Louis last went to war he led a whole army to destruction\nin Egypt. When I go to war, I lead my army to victory and the spoils of\na fair and prosperous kingdom. Louis was born a king. I made myself a\nking. Now. Which of us is the better ruler? Answer me that.\"\n\nSimon stared at Charles's engorged face and felt dizzy with triumph. Not\nonly had he lost all fear of Charles d'Anjou, but he had broken through\nCharles's mask of regal authority and had provoked him to reveal his\nnaked envy of his brother.\n\nHe answered quietly, \"You might conquer this whole world, and my\nsovereign seigneur, King Louis, would still be a better king than you\nare. And a better man.\"\n\nCharles stared at Simon, his eyes huge and thick veins standing out in\nhis temples. Simon stared back, keeping himself outwardly calm, but\ninwardly exulting in his new freedom.\n\n_There is nothing I need prove to this man or to anyone else. I am\nmyself._\n\nThe last bond of loyalty between himself and Charles d'Anjou was broken.\n\nThe silence stretched on, until it seemed to Simon that this was the\nlongest moment of his life.\n\nCharles blinked and let out several long breaths. \"Ah, well. As God is\nmy witness, you and my brother are two of a kind. You deserve each\nother.\" He shook his arms, which he had been holding rigid at his sides,\nand reached up and tapped the crown down more firmly on his head.\n\n_He lumps me with King Louis. He does not know the great honor he does\nme._\n\nCharles said, \"I hope, for the sake of what we have been to each other,\nthat you will be discreet about what I have said to you. If you visit my\nbrother when you go back to France, you must not cause ill will between\nhim and me.\"\n\n\"I doubt that even if I wished to I could cause bad feeling between\nyou,\" Simon said. \"He has known you all your life, and if he has not\nbroken with you by now, it must be because he loves you too much.\"\n\nHe turned abruptly and left Charles standing alone on his little hill.\n\nThe star swung at his neck, and he thought of going back and throwing it\nat Charles's feet. But, no, he decided he would keep it, and honor\nManfred's memory.\n\nThe grief of these two days still darkened his world, but there was one\nsmall brightness. He might not have accomplished anything to liberate\nthe Holy Land, but he had freed himself from Charles d'Anjou.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt hurt Simon to see Sophia's face. Her eyelids were red and puffed. Her\ncheeks were hollow and her lips pale. She was still beautiful, but it\nwas a sorrowful beauty, like that of a grieving Madonna.\n\n\"I see you are wearing Manfred's star,\" Sophia said.\n\n\"Forgive me.\" He felt a flash of hatred for himself. How stupid of him!\nShe must think he was wearing it like a captured trophy.\n\nHe said, \"Charles gave it to me. I swear to you, I mean no disrespect to\nManfred. Just the opposite. It must hurt you to see it. How thoughtless\nof me! Anjou insisted on my putting it around my neck just now. I am\nonly going to keep it safe in memory of Manfred, not wear it. Let me\ntake it off.\"\n\n_You are babbling_, he told himself. _Be still._\n\n\"No,\" she said, touching his hand lightly, briefly. \"No one has a better\nright to wear it than you.\"\n\nSimon said, \"I want you to know this--Daoud succeeded.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--succeeded how?\"\n\nThey stood just outside the walls of Benevento by the side of the road\nleading to the south. A group of Charles's men-at-arms, past whom Simon\nhad just escorted Sophia and her friends, lounged before the gate.\n\n\"Last night I suspected it, but this morning I talked to Anjou, and now\nI am certain. There will never be an alliance of Christians and Tartars.\nAnjou never wanted it, and he will do everything in his power to prevent\nit. It would interfere with his own ambitions.\"\n\nHer amber eyes looked into his, and he felt the pain she was holding\nrigidly at bay within herself.\n\nOh, God, those eyes! How he had dreamed of spending the rest of his life\nin their gaze. Now, after today, he would never look into them again.\n\nShe said, \"Does it disappoint you that there will be no alliance?\"\n\n\"Once it would have. After all, I gave everything I had to trying to\nmake the alliance succeed. But I did that for King Louis and for my own\nhonor more than because I believed the alliance was a good thing.\nIndeed, I often had doubts. I pray my people will never take part in\nsuch horrors as the Tartars have committed.\"\n\nSophia shook her head. \"If you are right, then I only wish Daoud could\nhave known before he died that his purpose was accomplished.\"\n\nThe thought came to Simon that Daoud might be aware of that, in the next\nworld, but it seemed a childish fancy in the face of her sorrow, and he\nsaid nothing.\n\nEven now, she thought only of Daoud.\n\nOh, why could not everything be different? Why could she not be the\ncardinal's niece, the lovely woman he had fallen in love with? Why must\nshe be a stranger with a Greek name he had already forgotten because he\nhad heard it only once, a plotter, a spy, an enemy?\n\nHe looked at the jagged blue mountains, mostly bare rock, that rose\nbehind Sophia, and in despair thought of climbing up there and throwing\nhimself off a cliff. The road she would be taking led into those\nmountains.\n\nCelino, mounted on a sturdy brown mare, held Sophia's chestnut horse for\nher. Ugolini and Tilia Caballo, dressed in dark peasants' clothes, sat\ntogether on the driver's seat of Celino's cart, Tilia holding the reins.\nWhere were those two going, Simon wondered. When he said good-bye to\nthem he had not thought to ask. No place in Sicily would be safe for\nthem. Well, they probably would not have wanted to tell him.\n\nRachel, sitting on a powerful-looking black mule, gave Simon a little\nsmile and a nod when he glanced her way. He smiled back.\n\n_May you find a good man, Celino's son or another. And may the rest of\nyour life be entirely happy._\n\n\"You are going back to Constantinople, then?\" he said to Sophia. He had\nto drag the words out of himself.\n\nShe nodded. \"I can get a ship from Palermo. Rachel has kindly offered to\npay my passage. Lorenzo found the chest full of gold she got from the\nTartar, right where he buried it out in the woods. So Rachel is still\nrich. As for me, I am quite destitute.\"\n\n_God's mantle! That never occurred to me. What an idiot I am._\n\n\"Would you--\"\n\nShe raised a hand to silence him and shook her head. \"I would not.\"\n\nHe shrugged and nodded. \"Take this from me at least--a warning to your\nemperor. Charles wants Constantinople. He has a claim to the crown of\nByzantium. He told me just today that he means to do to Michael what he\ndid to Manfred.\"\n\nSophia gave him a crooked little smile. \"Michael will never let him even\nget near Constantinople. I hope I can help with that.\"\n\n\"If ever I can do anything for you--\"\n\nHer smile grew wider. \"Do not be too quick to promise that, Simon. If we\never meet again, we may be on opposite sides.\" In a softer, sadder tone\nshe added, \"Again.\"\n\nHe took a step closer to her. \"If so, I will not be so easily deceived.\nNow I know the real Sophia, the one who did not love me.\"\n\nHer smile fell away. \"I think the real Sophia did love you, Simon. Every\ntime you told me how you loved me, it was as if you were taking me up to\na mountaintop and showing me a beautiful land I could never enter. And\nthe worst of it was that because I could not enter, neither could you.\nWe were both barred forever from happiness.\"\n\nThe look on her face made him want to burst out weeping. He held his\nbreath and pressed his lips together hard to stifle the sob.\n\nWhen he was able to speak, he said, \"I think I would have loved the real\nSophia if I could have known her.\"\n\nShe shut her eyes as if in terrible pain and pressed the palms of her\nhands against her stomach.\n\nHe reached out to take Sophia in his arms, but she stepped back from\nhim, and he saw that the tears were streaming down her pale cheeks. She\nheld out her hand.\n\nHe clasped her cold hand in both of his and said, \"I will never forget\nyou.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was setting in the desert to the west of El Kahira, the Guarded\nOne, giving a red tint to the white dust that drifted above the many\nroads that led to this city. Tilia Caballo sat on a silk cushion by the\npool in the vast interior garden of the palace of the sultan, known as\nthe Multicolored Palace because its walls and floors were inlaid with\nmany different kinds of marble and its ceilings painted in azure and\ngold. Tilia dabbled her hand in the pool and breathed deep of the scent\nof jasmine. A fountain threw white water high in the air, and orange and\nblack fish circled in the rippling pool. In the shadows nearby a peacock\nscreamed.\n\nShe heard footsteps behind her. The merest glance over her shoulder told\nher who it was, and she swiftly turned and knelt, pressing her forehead\nand the palms of her hands against the cool blue tiles.\n\nShe saw the pointed toes of scarlet boots before her. She raised her\nhead a bit and saw the boots themselves, gem-encrusted leather.\n\n\"Tilia.\" The voice made her shiver.\n\n\"El Malik Dahir,\" she addressed him. _Victorious King._\n\n\"God blesses our meeting, Tilia.\"\n\nShe sat back, and he lowered himself to a cross-legged position facing\nher. In the ten years since she had last seen him, he had aged little.\nHe had won the battle of the Well of Goliath, had made himself sultan,\nand had reigned over a kingdom threatened from East and West. Yet his\nyellow face was unlined, and there was no gray in his drooping red\nmustache. She looked at the white scar that ran vertically down his\nblind right eye; then she looked at his good left eye, and saw that it\nwas still bright blue and clear.\n\n\"Forgive me, Tilia, for not being able to greet you when you arrived in\nEl Kahira. I was inspecting the crusaders' defenses at Antioch--from the\ninside.\"\n\nShe laughed. Amazing that such a striking-looking man should manage\nagain and again to move among his enemies in disguise. But he had been\ndoing it most of his life.\n\n\"My lord travels far and fast, as always.\"\n\n\"You have traveled farther. You are comfortable?\"\n\n\"Who could fail to be comfortable, under Baibars's tent?\"\n\n\"And Cardinal Ugolini? Will he be happy here?\"\n\n\"The happiest he has ever been. He spends his days in your Zahiriya,\nreading ancient manuscripts, talking to the scholars, working with the\nphilosophical instruments. He hardly sleeps, the sooner he might return\nto the house of learning you built.\"\n\n\"Ah, we must find a strong young slave to comfort you if your cardinal\ndoes not spend enough time in your bed.\"\n\n\"I am not the voracious woman you bought from a brothel so many years\nago, my lord. Adelberto can satisfy my waning desires.\"\n\nBaibars laughed, a rumbling sound. \"Anything you want, Tilia, in all the\nsultanate of El Kahira, is yours. You have served me well.\"\n\n\"You took a prisoner and a slave and trusted her. You sent her jewels\nand gold in a steady stream. You helped her to achieve riches and power\nin the very heart of Christendom. Why should I not serve you with all my\nmight? Since you sent me from here long ago I have not had the chance to\nsee you with my own eyes and speak aloud my gratitude to you. And now\nthat I am face-to-face with you, words fail me. If I spoke for a\nthousand and one nights I could not say enough to thank you. To praise\nyou.\"\n\nBaibars shrugged. \"Do you not regret losing it all? You cannot open a\nbrothel here in El Kahira, Tilia. I have closed all the brothels.\" His\neyelids crinkled humorously. \"I am a very strict Muslim these days.\"\n\n\"I am ready to retire, my lord. Ready to drop all pretense and come back\nhere, just to be myself.\"\n\nBaibars's wide mouth drew down, the lips so thin that the line they drew\nseemed just a slash across the bottom of his face.\n\n\"Now that you are here, Tilia, now that we are face-to-face, I want to\nhear from you the story of Daoud. I want to hear all of it, all that you\nhad no room to tell me in your carrier-pigeon messages. Take as long as\nyou like. Ask for anything that will make you comfortable. My ears are\nfor you and for no one else.\"\n\n\"I am my lord's slave. I shall tell it to you as it happened to me.\" She\nsettled herself on the cushion. \"I first met Daoud ibn Abdallah in the\nhills outside Orvieto on an afternoon in late summer, three years\nago--\"\n\nTilia stopped her tale twice, so that she and Baibars could pray when\nthe muezzins called the faithful to prayer at Maghrib, after the red of\nsunset had left the sky, and again at 'Isha, when it was dark enough\nthat a white thread could not be told from a black thread.\n\nAfter the final prayer of the day, a servant brought an oil lamp.\nBaibars waved the lamp away, then called the servant back and asked for\nkaviyeh. Tilia drank the sweet, strong kaviyeh of El Kahira with Baibars\nand devoured a tray of sticky sweets, and then went on with her story.\n\nBy the time she was finished, the moon had risen above the courtyard.\nShe sat back and looked at the Victorious King.\n\n\"He was to me like my firstborn son.\" Baibars took a dagger from his\nsash, held open his shimmering silk kaftan, a costly robe of honor, and\nslashed a great rent in it.\n\nTilia wondered what to say. How could she comfort him?\n\n_Comfort him? How can anyone offer comfort to a man like Baibars?_\n\n\"We are Mamelukes,\" he said. \"Slaves. We are slaves of God. We are His\ninstruments. His weapons. I shaped Daoud to be a fine weapon against the\nenemies of the faith. And it is even as this Simon de Gobignon told the\nGreek woman Sophia--Daoud succeeded. Abagha Khan still seeks an alliance\nwith the Christians, as his father Hulagu did. But many Tartars have\nalready converted to Islam, and the next Tartar khan of Persia may be a\nMuslim. I am working to make that possibility a certainty. As for the\nChristians, my informant at the court of Charles d'Anjou, a certain\ndwarf named Erculio, tells me that now Charles desires to extend his\nempire across the Middle Sea into Africa. King Louis is already\ngathering ships and men for a crusade. But Charles is trying to divert\nLouis's crusade to Tunisia, which would make it harmless to us. He is a\nvery persuasive man, and I think he will succeed. Truly, this Charles is\nGod's gift to me. He does just what I want. And I do not have to pay\nhim.\"\n\nTilia heard no mirth in Baibars's deep laughter.\n\n\"And so,\" Baibars said, \"Daoud has won for us the time we needed and\nchanged the fate of nations. And he will be avenged.\"\n\n\"I do not think he would feel a need to be avenged, my lord. He would be\nhappy just to know that he saved his people from destruction.\"\n\nBaibars nodded. \"True. But I, too, am a sword in the hands of God. And\nif it pleases God to wield me, then in a generation there will not be a\ncrusader left anywhere on the sacred soil of al-Islam. That will be\nDaoud's vengeance and his monument. Hear me, O God.\"\n\nBy the light of the crescent moon hanging over the Multicolored Palace,\nTilia watched the Mameluke sultan raise his right hand to heaven. Tears\nran down his jutting cheeks. Baibars's tears, she saw, ran as freely\nfrom his blind eye as from the eye that could see.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n\nRobert Shea is co-author of the famous ILLUMINATUS! trilogy (Dell).

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
