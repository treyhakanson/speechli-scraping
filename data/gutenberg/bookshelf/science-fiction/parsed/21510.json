Trigger shifted toward the edge\nof the sidewalk to let them pass. As the line swayed up on her left,\nthere was a shadowy settling of an aircar at the curb to her right.\n\nWith loud outcries of glad recognition and whoops of laughter, the line\nswung in about her, close. Bodies crowded against her, a hand was\nclapped over her mouth. Other hands held her arms. Her feet came off the\nground and she had a momentary awareness of being rushed expertly\nforward.\n\nThere was a lurching twist as the aircar shot upward.\n\n\nSHE'S ABOUT TO ENTER THE MYSTERY OF HER LIFE, IN\n\nLegacy\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n_Also by James H.

The school's organized activities were not much affected by\nthe hour, but the big exercise quadrangle was almost deserted for once.\nBehind the railing of the firing range a young woman stood by herself,\ngun in hand, waiting for the automatic range monitor to select a new\nstring of targets for release.\n\nShe was around twenty-four, slim and trim in the school's comfortable\nhiking outfit. Tan shirt and knee-length shorts, knee stockings,\nsoft-soled shoes. Her sun hat hung on the railing, and the dawn wind\nwhipped strands of shoulder-length, modishly white-silver hair along her\ncheeks. She held a small, beautifully worked handgun loosely beside\nher--the twin-barrelled sporting Denton which gunwise citizens of the\nHub rated as a weapon for the precisionist and expert only. In\ninstitutions like the Colonial School it wasn't often seen.\n\nAt the exact instant the monitor released its new flight of targets, she\nbecame aware of the aircar gliding down toward her from the\nadministration buildings on the right. Startled, she glanced sideways\nlong enough to identify the car's two occupants, shifted her attention\nback to the cluster of targets speeding toward her, studied the flight\npattern for another unhurried half-second, finally raised the Denton.\nThe little gun spat its noiseless, invisible needle of destruction eight\ntimes. Six small puffs of crimson smoke hung in the air. The two\nremaining targets swerved up in a mocking curve and shot back to their\ndischarge huts.\n\nThe girl bit her lip in moderate annoyance, safetied and holstered the\ngun and waved her hand left-right at the range attendant to indicate she\nwas finished. Then she turned to face the aircar as it settled slowly to\nthe ground twenty feet away. Her gray eyes studied its occupants\ncritically.\n\n\"Fine example you set the students!\" she remarked. \"Flying right into a\nhot gun range!\"\n\nDoctor Plemponi, principal of the Colonial School, smiled soothingly.\n\"Eight years ago, your father bawled me out for the very same thing,\nTrigger! Much more abusively, I must say. You know that was my first\nmeeting with old Runser Argee, and I--\"\n\n\"Plemp!\" Mihul, Chief of Physical Conditioning, Women's Division,\ncautioned sharply from the seat behind him. \"Watch what you're doing,\nyou ass!\"\n\nConfused, Doctor Plemponi turned to look at her. The aircar dropped the\nlast four feet to a jolting landing. Mihul groaned. Plemponi apologized.\nTrigger walked over to them.\n\n\"Does he do that often?\" she asked interestedly.\n\n\"Every other time!\" Mihul asserted. She was a tall, lean, muscular slab\nof a woman, around forty. She gave Trigger a wink behind Plemponi's\nback. \"We keep the chiropractors on stand-by duty when we go riding with\nPlemp.\"\n\n\"Now then! Now then!\" Doctor Plemponi said. \"You distracted my attention\nfor a moment, that's all. Now, Trigger, the reason we're here is that\nMihul told me at our prebreakfast conference you weren't entirely happy\nat the good old Colonial School. So climb in, if you don't have much\nelse to do, and we'll run up to the office and discuss it.\" He opened\nthe door for her.\n\n\"Much else to do!\" Trigger gave him a look. \"All right, Doctor. We'll\nrun up and discuss it.\"\n\nShe went back for her sun hat, climbed in, closed the door and sat down\nbeside him, shoving the holstered Denton forward on her thigh.\n\nPlemponi eyed the gun dubiously. \"Brushing up in case there's another\ngrabber raid?\" he inquired. He reached out for the guide stick.\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"Just working off hostility, I guess.\" She\nwaited till he had lifted the car off the ground in a reckless swoop.\n\"That business yesterday--it really was a grabber raid?\"\n\n\"We're almost sure it was,\" Mihul said behind her, \"though I did hear\nsome talk they might have been after those two top-secret plasmoids in\nyour Project.\"\n\n\"_That's_ not very likely,\" Trigger remarked. \"The raiders were a half\nmile away from where they should have come down if the plasmoids were\nwhat they wanted. And from what I saw of them, they weren't nearly a big\nenough gang for a job of that kind.\"\n\n\"I thought so, too,\" Mihul said. \"They were topflight professionals, in\nany case. I got a glimpse of some of their equipment. Knockout\nguns--foggers--and that was a fast car!\"\n\n\"Very fast car,\" Trigger agreed. \"It's what made me suspicious when I\nfirst saw them come in.\"\n\n\"They also,\" said Mihul, \"had a high-speed interplanetary hopper waiting\nfor them in the hills. Two more men in it. The cops caught them, too.\"\nShe added, \"They were grabbers, all right!\"\n\n\"Anything to indicate whom they were after?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"No,\" Mihul said. \"Too many possibilities. Twenty or more of the\nstudents in that area at the time had important enough connections to\nclass as grabber bait. The cops won't talk except to admit they were\ntipped off about the raid. Which was obvious. The way they popped up out\nof nowhere and closed in on those boys was a beautiful sight to see!\"\n\n\"I,\" Trigger admitted, \"didn't see it. When that car homed in, I yelled\na warning to the nearest bunch of students and dropped flat behind a\nrock. By the time I risked a look, the cops had them.\"\n\n\"You showed very good sense,\" Plemponi told her earnestly. \"I hope they\nburn those thugs! Grabbing's a filthy business.\"\n\n\"That large object coming straight at you,\" Mihul observed calmly, \"is\nanother aircar. In this lane it has the right of way. You do not have\nthe right of way. Got all that, Plemp?\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Doctor Plemponi asked her bewilderedly. \"Confound it! I\nshall blow my siren.\"\n\nHe did. Trigger winced. \"There!\" Plemponi said triumphantly as the other\ndriver veered off in fright.\n\nTrigger told herself to relax. Aircars were so nearly accident-proof\nthat even Plemponi couldn't do more than snarl up traffic in one. \"Have\nthere been other raids in the school area since I left?\" she asked, as\nhe shot up out of the quadrangle and turned toward the balcony of his\noffice.\n\n\"That was just under four years ago, wasn't it?\" Mihul said. \"No, you\nwere still with us when we had the last one.... Six years back.\nRemember?\"\n\nTrigger did. Two students had been picked up on that occasion--sons of\nsome Federation official. The grabbers had made a clean getaway, and it\nhad been several months later before she heard the boys had been\nredeemed safely.\n\nPlemponi descended to a teetery but gentle landing on the office\nbalcony. He gave Trigger a self-satisfied look. \"See?\" he said tersely.\n\"Let's go in, ladies. Had breakfast yet, Trigger?\"\n\nTrigger had finished breakfast a half-hour earlier, but she accepted a\ncup of coffee. Mihul, all athlete, declined. She went over to Plemponi's\ndesk and stood leaning against it, arms folded across her chest, calm\nblue eyes fixed thoughtfully on Trigger. With her lithe length of body,\nMihul sometimes reminded Trigger of a ferret, but the tanned face was a\npleasant one and there was humor around the mouth. Even in Trigger's\npregraduate days, she and Mihul had been good friends.\n\nDoctor Plemponi removed a crammed breakfast tray from a wall chef, took\na chair across from Trigger, sat down with the tray on his knees,\nexcused himself, and began to eat and talk simultaneously.\n\n\"Before we go into that very reasonable complaint you made to Mihul\nyesterday,\" he said, \"I wish you'd let me point out a few things.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Please do.\"\n\n\"You, Trigger,\" Plemponi told her, \"are an honored guest here at the\nColonial School. You're the daughter of our late friend and colleague\nRunser Argee. You were one of our star pupils--not just as a small-arms\nmedallist either. And now you're the secretary and assistant of the\nfamous Precolonial Commissioner Holati Tate--which makes you almost a\nparticipant in what may well turn out to be the greatest scientific\nevent of the century.... I'm referring, of course,\" Plemponi added, \"to\nTate's discovery of the Old Galactic plasmoids.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" agreed Trigger. \"And what is all this leading up to,\nPlemp?\"\n\nHe waved a piece of toast at her. \"No. Don't interrupt! I still have to\npoint out that because of the exceptional managerial abilities you\nrevealed under Tate, you've been sent here on detached duty for the\nPrecolonial Department to aid the Commissioner and Professor Mantelish\nin the University League's Plasmoid Project. That means you're a pretty\nimportant person, Trigger! Mantelish, for all his idiosyncrasies, is\nundoubtedly the greatest living biologist in the League. And the\nPlasmoid Project here at the school is without question the League's\nmost important current undertaking.\"\n\n\"So I've been told,\" said Trigger. \"That's why I want to find out what's\ngone haywire with it.\"\n\n\"In a moment,\" Plemponi said. \"In a moment.\" He located his napkin,\nwiped his lips carefully. \"Now I've mentioned all this simply to make it\nvery, very clear that we'll do anything we can to keep you satisfied.\nWe're delighted to have you with us. We are honored!\" He beamed at her.\n\"Right?\"\n\nTrigger smiled. \"If you say so. And thanks very much for all the lovely\ncompliments, Doctor. But now let's get down to business.\"\n\nPlemponi glanced over at Mihul and looked evasive. \"That being?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"You know,\" Trigger said. \"But I'll put it into specific questions if\nyou like. Where's Commissioner Tate?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Where is Mantelish?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I don't know that either.\" He began to look unhappy.\n\n\"Oh?\" said Trigger. \"Who does know then?\"\n\n\"I'm not allowed to tell you,\" Doctor Plemponi said firmly.\n\nTrigger raised an eyebrow. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Federation security,\" Plemponi said, frowning. He added, \"I wasn't\nsupposed to tell you that either, but what could I do?\"\n\n\"Federation security? Because of the plasmoids?\"\n\n\"Yes.... Well.... I'd--I don't know.\"\n\nTrigger sighed. \"Is it just me you're not supposed to tell these things\nto?\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" Plemponi said hastily. \"Nobody. I'm not supposed to admit\nto anyone that I know anything of the whereabouts of Holati Tate or\nProfessor Mantelish.\"\n\n\"Fibber!\" Trigger said quietly. \"So you know!\"\n\nPlemponi looked appealingly at Mihul. She was grinning. \"My lips are\nsealed, Trigger! I can't help it. Please believe me.\"\n\n\"Let _me_ sum it up then,\" Trigger said, tapping the arm of her chair\nwith a finger tip. \"Eight weeks ago I get pulled off my job in the Manon\nSystem and sent here to arrange the organizational details of this\nPlasmoid Project. The only reason I took on the job, as a temporary\nassignment, was that Commissioner Tate convinced me it was important to\nhim to have me do it. I even let him talk me into doing it under the\nassumed name of Ruya Farn and\"--she reached up and touched the side of\nher head--\"and to dye my hair. For no sane reason that I could discover!\nHe said the U-League had requested it.\"\n\nDoctor Plemponi coughed. \"Well, you know, Trigger, how sensitive the\nLeague is to personal notoriety.\"\n\nThe eyebrow went up again. \"Notoriety?\"\n\n\"Not in the wrong sense!\" Plemponi said hastily. \"But your name _has_\nbecome much more widely known than you may believe. The news viewers\nmentioned you regularly in their reports on Harvest Moon and the\nCommissioner. Didn't they, Mihul?\"\n\nMihul nodded. \"You made good copy, kid! We saw you in the solidopics any\nnumber of times.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe,\" Trigger said. \"The cloak and dagger touches still don't\nmake much sense to me. But let's forget them and go on.\n\n\"When we get here, I manage to see Mantelish just once to try to find\nout what his requirements will be. He's pretty vague about them.\nCommissioner Tate is in and out of the Project--usually out. He's also\nturned pretty vague. About everything. Three weeks ago today I'm told\nhe's gone. Nobody here can, or will, tell me where he's gone or how he\ncan be contacted. The same thing in the Maccadon Precol office. Same\nthing at the Evalee Home office. Same thing at the U-League--any\noffice. Then I try to contact Mantelish. I'm informed he's with Tate!\nThe two of them have left word I'm to carry on.\"\n\nShe spread her hands. \"Carry on with what? I've done all I can do until\nI get further instructions from the people supposedly directing this\nsupposedly very urgent and important project! Mantelish doesn't even\nseem to have a second in command....\"\n\nPlemponi nodded. \"I was told he hadn't selected his Project assistants\nyet.\"\n\n\"Except,\" said Trigger, \"for that little flock of Junior Scientists who\nkeep themselves locked in with the plasmoids. They know less than\nnothing and would be too scared to tell me that if I asked them.\"\n\nPlemponi looked confused for a moment. \"The last sentence--\" He checked\nhimself. \"Well, let's not quibble. Go on.\"\n\nTrigger said, \"That's it. Holati didn't need me on this job to begin\nwith. There's nothing involved about the organizational aspects. Unless\nsomething begins to happen--and rather soon--there's no excuse for me to\nstay here.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you,\" Plemponi suggested, \"regard this as a kind of\nwell-earned little vacation?\"\n\n\"I've tried to regard it as that. Holati impressed on me that one of us\nhad to remain in the area of the Project at all times, so I haven't even\nbeen able to leave the school grounds. I've caught up with my reading,\nand Mihul has put me through two of her tune-up commando courses. But\nthe point is that I'm not on vacation. I don't believe Precol would feel\nthat any of my present activities come under the heading of detached\nduty work!\"\n\nThere was a short silence. Plemponi stared down at his empty tray, said,\n\"Excuse me,\" got up and walked over to the wall chef with the tray.\n\n\"Wrong slot,\" Trigger told him.\n\nHe looked back. \"Eh?\"\n\n\"You want to put it in the disposal, don't you?\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Plemponi said absently. \"Always doing that. Confusing\nthem....\" He dropped the tray where it belonged, shoved his hands into\nthe chef's cleaning recess and waved them around, then came back, still\nlooking absent-minded, and stopped before Trigger's chair. He studied\nher face for a moment.\n\n\"Commissioner Tate gave me a message for you,\" he said suddenly.\n\nTrigger's eyes narrowed slightly. \"When?\"\n\n\"The day after he left.\" Plemponi lifted a hand. \"Now wait! You'll see\nhow it was. He called in and said, and I quote, 'Plemp, you don't stand\nmuch of a chance at keeping secrets from Trigger, so I'll give you no\nunnecessary secrets to keep. If this business we're on won't let us get\nback to the Project in the next couple of weeks, she'll get mighty\nrestless. When she starts to complain--but no earlier--just tell her\nthere are reasons why I can't contact her at present, or let her know\nwhat I'm doing, and that I _will_ contact her as soon as I possibly\ncan.' End of quote.\"\n\n\"That was all?\" asked Trigger.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He didn't say a thing about how long this situation might continue?\"\n\n\"No. I've given you the message word for word. My memory is excellent,\nTrigger.\"\n\n\"So it could be more weeks? Or months?\"\n\n\"Yes. Possibly. I imagine....\" Plemponi had begun to perspire.\n\n\"Plemp,\" said Trigger, \"will you give Holati a message from me?\"\n\n\"Gladly!\" said Plemponi. \"What--oh, oh!\" He flushed.\n\n\"Right,\" said Trigger. \"You can contact him. I thought so.\"\n\nDoctor Plemponi looked reproachful. \"That was unfair, Trigger! You're\nquick-witted.\"\n\nTrigger shrugged. \"I can't see any justification for all this mystery,\nthat's all.\" She stood up. \"Anyway, here's the message. Tell him that\nunless somebody--rather promptly--gives me a good sane reason for\nhanging around here, I'll ask Precol to transfer me back to the Manon\njob.\"\n\nPlemponi tut-tutted gloomily. \"Trigger,\" he said, \"I'll do my best about\nthe message. But otherwise--\"\n\nShe smiled nicely at him. \"I know,\" she said, \"your lips are sealed.\nSorry if I've disturbed you, Plemp. But I'm just a Precol employee,\nafter all. If I'm to waste their time, I'd like to know at least why\nit's necessary.\"\n\nPlemponi watched her walk out of the room and off down the adjoining\nhall. In his face consternation struggled with approval.\n\n\"Lovely little figure, hasn't she?\" he said to Mihul. He made vague\ncurving motions in the air with one hand, more or less opposing ones\nwith the other. \"That sort of an up-and-sideways lilt when she walks.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" said Mihul. \"Old goats.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Doctor Plemponi.\n\n\"I overheard you discussing Trigger's lilt with Mantelish.\"\n\nPlemponi sat down at his desk. \"You shouldn't eavesdrop, Mihul,\" he said\nseverely. \"I'd better get that message promptly to Tate, I suppose. She\nmeant what she said, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Every bit of it,\" said Mihul.\n\n\"Tate warned me she might get very difficult about this time. She's too\nconscientious, I feel.\"\n\n\"She also,\" said Mihul, \"has a boy friend in the Manon System. They've\nbeen palsy ever since they went through the school here together.\"\n\n\"Ought to get married then,\" Plemponi said. He shuddered. \"My blood runs\ncold every time I think of how close those grabbers got to her\nyesterday!\"\n\nMihul shrugged. \"Relax! They never had a chance. The characters Tate has\nguarding her are the fastest-moving squad I ever saw go into action.\"\n\n\"That,\" Plemponi said reflectively, \"doesn't sound much like our\nMaccadon police.\"\n\n\"I don't think they are. Imported talent of some kind, for my money.\nAnyway, if someone wants to pick up Trigger Argee here, he'd better come\nin with a battleship.\"\n\nPlemponi glanced nervously across the balcony at the cloudless blue sky\nabout the quadrangle.\n\n\"The impression I got from Holati Tate,\" he said, \"is that somebody\nmight.\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThere was a tube portal at the end of the hall outside Doctor Plemponi's\noffice. Mihul stepped into the portal, punched the number of her\npersonal quarters, waited till the overhead light flashed green a few\nseconds later, and stepped out into another hall seventeen floors below\nPlemponi's office and a little over a mile and a half away from it.\n\nMihul crossed the hall, went into her apartment, locked the door behind\nher and punched a shield button. In her bedroom, she opened a wall safe\nand swung out a high-powered transmitter. She switched the transmitter\nto active.\n\n\"Yes?\" said a voice.\n\n\"Mihul here,\" said Mihul. \"Quillan or the Commissioner....\"\n\n\"Quillan here,\" the transmitter said a few seconds later in a different\nvoice, a deep male one. \"Go ahead, doll.\"\n\nMihul grunted. \"I'm calling,\" she said, \"because I feel strongly that\nyou boys had better take some immediate action in the Argee matter.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said the voice. \"What kind of action?\"\n\n\"How the devil would I know? I'm just telling you I can't be responsible\nfor her here much longer.\"\n\n\"Has something happened?\" Quillan asked quickly.\n\n\"If you mean has somebody taken another swing at her, no. But she's all\nwound up to start swinging herself. She isn't going to do much waiting\neither.\"\n\nQuillan said thoughtfully, \"Hasn't she been that way for quite a while?\"\n\n\"Not like she's been the last few days.\" Mihul hesitated. \"Would it be\nagainst security if you told me whether something has happened to her?\"\n\n\"Happened to her?\" Quillan repeated cautiously.\n\n\"To her mind.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\nMihul frowned at the transmitter.\n\n\"Trigger always had a temper,\" she said. \"She was always obstinate. She\nwas always an individualist and ready to fight for her own rights and\nanyone else's. But she used to show good sense. She's got one of the\nhighest I.Q.s we ever processed through this place. The way she's acting\nnow doesn't look too rational.\"\n\n\"How would she have acted earlier?\" Quillan asked.\n\nMihul considered. \"She would have been very annoyed with Commissioner\nTate,\" she said. \"I don't blame her for that--I'd be, too, in the\ncircumstances. When he got back, she'd have wanted a reasonable\nexplanation for what has been going on. If she didn't get one that\nsatisfied her, she'd have quit. But she _would_ have waited till he got\nback. Why not, after all?\"\n\n\"You don't think she's going to wait now?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" Mihul said. \"She's forwarded him a kind of ultimatum through\nPlemponi. Communicate-or-else, in effect. Frankly, I wouldn't care to\nguarantee she'll stay around to hear the answer.\"\n\n\"Hm.... What do you expect she'll do?\"\n\n\"Take off,\" Mihul said. \"One way or the other.\"\n\n\"Ungh,\" Quillan said disgustedly. \"You make it sound like the chick's\ngot built-in space drives. You can stop her, can't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly I can stop her,\" Mihul said. \"If I can lock her in her room\nand sit on her to make sure she doesn't leave by the window. But\n'unobtrusively?' You're the one who stressed she isn't to know she's\nbeing watched.\"\n\n\"True,\" Quillan said promptly. \"I spoke like a loon, Mihul.\"\n\n\"True, Major Quillan, sir,\" said Mihul. \"Now try again.\"\n\nThe transmitter was silent a few seconds. \"Could you guarantee her for\nthree days?\" he asked.\n\n\"I could not,\" said Mihul. \"I couldn't guarantee her another three\nhours.\"\n\n\"As bad as that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mihul. \"As bad as that. She was controlling herself with\nPlemponi. But I've been observing her in the physical workouts. I've fed\nit to her as heavy as I could, but there's a limit to what you can do\nthat way. She's kept herself in very good shape.\"\n\n\"One of the best, I've been told,\" said Quillan.\n\n\"Condition, I meant,\" said Mihul. \"Anyway, she's trained down fine right\nnow. Any more of it would just make her edgier. You know how it goes.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" he said. \"Fighter nerves.\"\n\n\"Same deal,\" Mihul agreed.\n\nThere was a short pause. \"How about slapping a guard on all Colonial\nschool exits?\" he suggested.\n\n\"Can you send me an army?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then forget it. She was a student here, remember? Last year a bunch of\nour students smuggled the stuffed restructured mastodon out and left it\nin the back garden of the mayor of Ceyce, just for laughs. Too many\nexits. And Trigger was a trickier monkey than most that way, when she\nfelt like it. She'll fade out of here whenever she wants to.\"\n\n\"It's those damn tube portal systems!\" said Quillan, with feeling. \"Most\ngruesome invention that ever hit the tailing profession.\" He sighed.\n\"You win, Mihul! The Commissioner isn't in at the moment. But whether he\ngets in or not, I'll have someone over today to pick her up. Matter of\nfact, I'll come along myself.\"\n\n\"Good for you, boy!\" Mihul said relievedly. \"Did you get anything out of\nyesterday's grabbers?\"\n\n\"A little. 'Get her, don't harm her' were their instructions. Otherwise\nit was like with those other slobs. A hole in the head where the real\ninfo should be. But at least we know for sure now that someone is\nspecifically after Argee. The price was kind of interesting.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"Flat half million credits.\"\n\nMihul whistled. \"Poor Trigger!\"\n\n\"Well, nobody's very likely to earn the money.\"\n\n\"I hope not. She's a good kid. All right, Major. Signing off now.\"\n\n\"Hold on a minute,\" said Quillan. \"You asked a while ago if the girl had\ngone ta-ta.\"\n\n\"So I did,\" Mihul said, surprised. \"You didn't say. I figured it was\nagainst security.\"\n\n\"It probably is,\" Quillan admitted. \"Everything seems to be, right now.\nI've given up trying to keep up with that. Anyway--I don't know that she\nhas. Neither does the Commissioner. But he's worried. And Argee has a\ndate she doesn't know about with the Psychology Service, four days from\nnow.\"\n\n\"The eggheads?\" Mihul was startled. \"What do they want with her?\"\n\n\"You know,\" Quillan remarked reflectively, \"that's odd! They didn't\nthink to tell me.\"\n\n\"Why are you letting me know?\" Mihul asked.\n\n\"You'll find out, doll,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe U-League guard leaning against the wall opposite the portal snapped\nto attention as it opened. Trigger stepped out. He gave her a fine\nflourish of a salute.\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Farn.\"\n\n\"Morning,\" Trigger said. She flashed him a smile. \"Did the mail get in?\"\n\n\"Just twenty minutes ago.\"\n\nShe nodded, smiled again and walked past him to her office. She always\ngot along fine with cops of almost any description, and these League\nboys were extraordinarily pleasant and polite. They were also, she'd\nnoticed, a remarkably muscled group.\n\nShe locked the office door behind her--part of the Plasmoid Project's\nelaborate security precautions--went over to her mail file and found it\nempty. Which meant that whatever had come in was purely routine and\nalready being handled by her skeleton office staff. Later in the day she\nmight get a chance to scrawl Ruya Farn's signature on a few dozen\nletters and checks. Big job! Trigger sat down at her desk.\n\nShe brooded there a minute or two, tapping her teeth with her thumbnail.\nThe Honorable Precolonial Commissioner Tate, whatever else might be said\nof him, undoubtedly was one of the brainiest little characters she'd\never come across. He probably saw some quite valid reason for keeping\nher here, isolated and uninformed. The question was what the reason\ncould be.\n\nSecurity.... Trigger wrinkled her nose. Security didn't mean a thing.\nEverybody and everything associated with the Old Galactic plasmoids had\nbeen wrapped up in Federation security measures since the day the\nplasmoid discovery was announced. And she'd been in the middle of the\noperations concerning them right along. Why should Holati Tate have\nturned secretive on her now? When even blabby old Plemponi could contact\nhim.\n\nIt was more than a little annoying....\n\nTrigger shrugged, reached into a desk drawer and took out a small\nsolidopic. She set it on the desk and regarded it moodily.\n\nThe face of an almost improbably handsome young man looked back at her.\nStartling dark-blue eyes; a strong chin, curly brown hair. There was a\ngleam of white teeth behind the quick, warm smile which always awoke a\nresponsive glow in her.\n\nShe and Brule Inger had been the nearest thing to engaged for the last\ntwo and a half years, ever since Precol sent them out together to its\nproject on Manon Planet. They'd been dating before that, while they were\nboth still attending the Colonial School. But now she was here, perhaps\nstuck here indefinitely--unless she did something about it--and Brule\nwas on Manon Planet. By the very fastest subspace ships the Manon System\nwas a good nine days away. For the standard Grand Commerce express\nfreighter or the ordinary liner it was a solid two-months' run. Manon\nwas a _long_ way away!\n\nIt was almost a month since she'd even heard from Brule. She could make\nup another personal tape to him today if she felt like it. He would get\nit in fourteen days or so via a Federation packet. But she'd already\nsent him three without reply. Brule wasn't at all good at long distance\nlove-making, and she didn't blame him much. She was a little awkward\nherself when it came to feeding her personal feelings into a tape.\nAnd--because of security again--there was very little else she could\nfeed into it. She couldn't even let Brule know just where she was.\n\nShe put the solido back in its drawer, reached for one of the bank of\nbuttons on the right side of the desk and pushed it down. A desk panel\nslid up vertically in front of her, disclosing a news viewer switched to\nthe index of current headlines.\n\nTrigger glanced over the headlines, while a few items dissolved slowly\nhere and there and were replaced by more recent developments. Under the\n\"Science\" heading a great deal seemed to be going on, as usual, in\nconnection with plasmoid experiments around the Hub.\n\nShe dialed in the heading, skimmed through the first item that appeared.\nEssentially it was a summary of reports on Hubwide rumors that nobody\ncould claim any worthwhile progress in determining what made the Old\nGalactic plasmoids tick. Which, so far as Trigger knew, was quite true.\nOther rumors, rather unpleasant ones, were that the five hundred or so\nscientific groups to whom individual plasmoids had been issued by the\nFederation's University League actually had gained important\ninformation, but were keeping it to themselves.\n\nThe summary plowed through a few of the learned opinions and\ncounteropinions most recently obtained, then boiled them down to the\nstatement that a plasmoid might be compared to an engine which\nappeared to lack nothing but an energy source. Or perhaps more\ncorrectly--assuming it might have an as yet unidentified energy\nsource--a starter button. One group claimed to have virtually duplicated\nthe plasmoid loaned to it by the Federation, producing a biochemical\nstructure distinguishable from the Old Galactic model only by the fact\nthat it had--quite predictably--fallen apart within hours. But plasmoids\ndidn't fall apart. The specimens undergoing study had shown no signs of\ndeterioration. A few still absorbed nourishment from time to time; some\nhad been observed to move slightly. But none could be induced to\noperate. It was all very puzzling!\n\nIt _was_ very puzzling, Trigger conceded. Back in the Manon System, when\nthey had been discovered, the plasmoids were operating with high\nefficiency on the protein-collecting station which the mysterious Old\nGalactics appeared to have abandoned, or forgotten about, some hundreds\nof centuries ago. It was only when humans entered the base and switched\noff its mechanical operations that the plasmoids stopped working--and\nthen, when the switches which appeared to have kept them going were\nexpectantly closed again, they had stayed stopped.\n\nPersonally, Trigger couldn't have cared less if they never did move. It\nwas nice that old Holati Tate had made an almost indecently vast\nfortune out of his first-discovery rights to the things, because she\nwas really very fond of the Commissioner when he wasn't being\nirritating. But in some obscure way she found the plasmoids themselves\nand the idea of unlimited plastic life which they embodied rather\nappalling. However, she was in a minority there. Practically everybody\nelse seemed to feel that plasmoids were the biggest improvement since\nthe creation of Eve.\n\nShe switched the viewer presently to its local-news setting and dialed\nin the Manon System's reference number. Keeping tab on what was going on\nout there had become a private little ritual of late. Occasionally she\neven picked up references to Brule Inger, who functioned nowadays as\nPrecol's official greeter and contact man in the system. He was very\npopular with the numerous important Hub citizens who made the long run\nout to the Manon--some bent on getting a firsthand view of the marvels\nof Old Galactic science, and a great many more bent on getting an early\nstake in the development of Manon Planet, which was rapidly approaching\nthe point where its status would shift from Precol Project to Federation\nTerritory, opening it to all qualified comers.\n\nToday there was no news about Brule. Grand Commerce had opened its first\nbusiness and recreation center on Manon, not ten miles from the Precol\nHeadquarters dome where Trigger recently had been working. The subspace\nnet which was being installed about the Old Galactic base was very\nnearly completed. The permanent Hub population on Manon Planet had just\npassed the forty-three thousand mark. There had been, Trigger recalled,\na trifle nostalgically, barely eight hundred Precol employees, and not\nanother human being, on that world in the days before Holati Tate\nannounced his discovery.\n\nShe was just letting the viewer panel slide back into the desk when the\noffice ComWeb gave forth with a musical ping. She switched it on.\n\n\"Hi, Rak!\" she said cheerily. \"Anything new?\"\n\nThe bony-faced young man looking out at her wore the lusterless black\nuniform of a U-League Junior Scientist. His expression was worried.\n\nHe said, \"I believe there is, Miss Farn.\" Rak was the group leader of\nthe thirty-four Junior Scientists the League had installed in the\nProject. Like all the Juniors, he took his duties very seriously.\n\"Unfortunately it's nothing I can discuss over a communicator. Would it\nbe possible for you to come over and meet with us during the day?\"\n\n\"That,\" Trigger stated, \"was a ridiculous question, Rak! Want me over\nright now?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Thanks, Miss Farn! In twenty minutes then? I'll get my\nadvisory committee together and we can meet in the little conference\nroom off the Exhibition Hall.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"I'll be wandering around the Hall. Just send a guard\nout to get me when you're ready.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nShe switched off the ComWeb and stood up. Rak and his group were stuck\nwith the Plasmoid Project a lot more solidly than she was. They'd been\nestablished here, confined to their own wing of the Project area, when\nshe came in from Manon with the Commissioner. Until the present security\nrulings were relaxed--which might not be for another two years--they\nwould remain on the project.\n\nTrigger felt a little sorry for them, though the Junior Scientists\ndidn't seem to mind the setup. Dedication stood out all over them. Since\nabout half were young women, one could assume that at any rate they\nweren't condemned to a completely monastic existence.\n\nA couple of workmen were guiding a dozen big cleaning robots around the\nPlasmoid Exhibition Hall, which wouldn't be open to students or\nvisitors for another few hours. Trigger strolled across the floor of the\nhuge area toward a couple of exhibits that hadn't been there the last\ntime she'd come through. Life-sized replicas of two O.G.\nPlasmoids--Numbers 1432 and 1433--she discovered. She regarded the\nwaxy-looking, lumpish, partially translucent forms with some distaste.\nShe'd been all over the Old Galactic Station itself, and might have\nstood close enough to the originals of these models to touch them. Not\nthat she would have.\n\nShe glanced at her watch, walked around a scale model of Harvest Moon,\nthe O.G. station, which occupied the center of the Hall, and went on\namong the exhibits. There were views taken on Manon Planet in one\nalcove, mainly of Manon's aerial plankton belt and of the giant\nplasmoids called Harvesters which had moved about the belt, methodically\nengulfing its clouds of living matter. A whale-sized replica of a\nHarvester dominated one end of the Hall, a giant dark-green sausage in\nexternal appearance, though with some extremely fancy internal\narrangements.\n\n\"Miss Farn....\"\n\nShe turned. A League cop, standing at the entrance of a hallway thirty\nfeet away, pitched her the old flourish and followed it up with a bow.\nExcellent manners these guard boys had!\n\nTrigger gave him a smile.\n\n\"Coming,\" she said.\n\nJunior Scientist Rak and his advisory committee--two other young men and\na young woman--were waiting in the conference room for her. They all\nstood up when she came in. This room marked the border of their\nterritory; they would have violated several League rules by venturing\nout into the hall through which Trigger had entered.\n\nAnd that would have been unthinkable.\n\nRak did the talking, as on the previous occasions when Trigger had met\nwith this group. The advisory committee simply sat there and watched\nhim. As far as Trigger could figure it, they were present at these\nsessions only to check Rak if it looked as if he were about to commit\nsome ghastly indiscretion.\n\n\"We were wondering, Miss Farn,\" Rak said questioningly, \"whether you\nhave the authority to requisition additional University League guards\nfor the Plasmoid Project?\"\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"I've got no authority of any kind that I know\nof, as far as the League is concerned. No doubt Professor Mantelish\ncould arrange it for you.\"\n\nRak nodded. \"Is it possible for you to contact Professor Mantelish?\"\n\n\"No,\" Trigger said. She smiled. \"Is it possible for you to contact him?\"\n\nRak glanced around his committee as if looking for approval, then said,\n\"No, it isn't. As a matter of fact, Miss Farn, we've been isolated here\nin the most curious fashion for the past few weeks.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said Miss Farn.\n\nRak looked startled. \"Oh!\" he said. \"We were hoping you would be willing\nto give us a little information.\"\n\n\"I would,\" Trigger assured him, \"if I had any to give. I don't,\nunfortunately.\" She considered. \"Why do you feel additional League\nguards are required?\"\n\n\"We heard,\" Rak remarked cautiously, \"that there were raiders in the\nColonial School area yesterday.\"\n\n\"Grabbers,\" Trigger said. \"They wouldn't bother you. Your section of the\nproject is supposed to be raidproof anyway.\"\n\nRak glanced at his companions again and apparently received some\nundetectable sign of consent. \"Miss Farn, as you know, our group has\nbeen entrusted with the care of two League plasmoids here. Are you aware\nthat six of the plasmoids which were distributed to responsible\nlaboratories throughout the Hub have been lost to unknown raiders?\"\n\nShe was startled. \"No, I didn't know that. I heard there'd been some\nunsuccessful attempts to steal distributed plasmoids.\"\n\n\"These six attempts,\" Rak said primly, \"were completely successful. One\nmust assume that the victimized laboratories also had been regarded as\nraidproof.\"\n\nTrigger admitted it was a reasonable assumption.\n\n\"There is another matter,\" Rak went on. \"When we arrived here, we\nunderstood Doctor Gess Fayle was to bring Plasmoid Unit 112-113 to this\nproject. It seems possible that Doctor Fayle's failure to appear\nindicates that League Headquarters does not consider the project a\nsufficiently safe place for 112-113.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask Headquarters?\" Trigger suggested.\n\nThey stirred nervously.\n\n\"That would be a violation of the Principle of the Chain of Command,\nMiss Farn!\" Rak explained.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. The Juniors were overdisciplined, all right. \"Is that\n112-113 such a particularly important item?\"\n\n\"If Doctor Fayle is in personal charge of it,\" Rak said carefully, \"I\nwould say yes.\"\n\nRecalling her meetings with Doctor Gess Fayle in the Manon System,\nTrigger silently agreed. He was one of the U-League's big shots, a\npolitical scientist who had got himself appointed as Mantelish's chief\nassistant when that eminent biologist was first sent to Manon to take\nover League operations there. Trigger had disliked Fayle on sight, and\nhadn't changed her mind on closer acquaintance.\n\n\"I remember that 112-113 unit now,\" she said suddenly. \"Big, ugly\nthing--well, that describes a lot of them, doesn't it?\"\n\nRak and the others looked quietly affronted. In a moment, Trigger\nrealized, one of them was going to go into a lecture on functional\nesthetics unless she could head them off--and she'd already heard quite\nenough about functional esthetics in connection with the plasmoids.\n\n\"Now, 113,\" she hurried on, \"is a very small plasmoid\"--she held her\nhands fifteen inches or so apart--\"like that; and it's attached to the\nbig one. Correct?\"\n\nRak nodded, a little stiffly. \"Essentially correct, Miss Farn.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said, \"I can't blame you for worrying a bit. How about\nyour Guard Captain? Isn't it all right to ask him about reinforcements?\"\n\nRak pursed his lips. \"Yes. And I did. This morning. Before I called\nyou.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nRak grimaced unhappily. \"He implied, Miss Farn, that his present guard\ncomplement could handle any emergency. How would he know?\"\n\n\"That's his job,\" Trigger pointed out gently. The Juniors did look badly\nworried. \"He didn't have any helpful ideas?\"\n\n\"None,\" said Rak. \"He said that if someone wanted to put up the money to\nhire a battle squad of Special Federation Police, he could always find\nsome use for them. But that's hopeless, of course.\"\n\nTrigger straightened up. She reached out and poked Rak's bony chest with\na finger tip. \"You know something?\" she said. \"It's not!\"\n\nThe four faces lit up together.\n\n\"The fact is,\" Trigger went on, \"that I'm handling the Project budget\nuntil someone shows up to take over. So I think I'll just buy you that\nFederation battle squad, Rak! I'll get on it right away.\" She stood up.\nThe Juniors bounced automatically out of their chairs. \"You go tell your\nguard Captain,\" she instructed them from the hall door, \"there'll be a\nsquad showing up in time for dinner tonight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Federation Police Office in Ceyce informed Trigger that a Class A\nBattle Squad--twenty trained men with full equipment--would report for\ntwo months' duty at the Colonial School during the afternoon. She made\nthem out a check and gave it the Ruya Farn signature via telewriter. The\nfigure on that check was going to cause some U-League auditor's eyebrows\nto fly off the top of his head one of these days; but if the League\ninsisted on remaining aloof to the problems of its Plasmoid Project, a\nlittle financial anguish was the least it could expect in return.\n\nTrigger felt quite cheerful for a while.\n\nThen she had a call from Precol's Maccadon office. She was requested to\nstand by while a personal interstellar transmission was switched to her\nComWeb.\n\nIt looked like her day! She hummed softly, waiting. She knew just one\nindividual affluent enough to be able to afford personal interstellar\nconversations; and that was Commissioner Tate. Fast work, Plemp, she\nthought approvingly.\n\nBut it was Brule Inger's face that flashed into view on the ComWeb.\nTrigger's heart jumped. Her breath caught in her throat.\n\n\"Brule!\" she yelled then. She shot up out of her chair. \"Where are you\ncalling from?\"\n\nBrule's eyes crinkled around the edges. He gave her the smile. The good\nold smile. \"Unfortunately, darling, I'm still in the Manon System.\" He\nblinked. \"What happened to your hair?\"\n\n\"Manon!\" said Trigger. She started to settle back, weak with\ndisappointment. Then she shot up again. \"Brule! Lunatic! You're blowing\na month's salary a minute on this! I love you! Switch off, fast!\"\n\nBrule threw back his head and laughed. \"You haven't changed much in two\nmonths, anyway! Don't worry. It's for free. I'm calling from the yacht\nof a friend.\"\n\n\"Some friend!\" Trigger said, startled.\n\n\"It isn't costing her anything either. She had to transmit to the Hub\ntoday anyway. Asked me if I'd like to take over the last few minutes of\ncontact and see if I could locate you.... Been missing me properly,\nTrigger?\"\n\nTrigger smiled. \"Very properly. Well, that was lovely of her! Someone I\nknow?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Brule. \"Nelauk arrived a week or so after you left.\nNelauk Pluly. Her father's the Pluly Lines. Let's talk about you. What's\nthe silver-haired idea?\"\n\n\"Got talked into it,\" she told him. \"It's all the rage again right now.\"\nHe surveyed her critically. \"I like you better as a redhead.\"\n\n\"So do I.\" Oops, Trigger thought. Security, girl! \"So I'll change back\ntonight,\" she went on quickly. \"Golly, Brule. It's nice to see that\nhomely old mug again!\"\n\n\"Be a lot nicer when it won't have to be over a transmitter.\"\n\n\"Right you are!\"\n\n\"When are you coming back?\"\n\nShe shook her head glumly. \"Don't know.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment. \"I've had to take a bit of chitchat now and\nthen,\" he remarked, \"about you and old Tate vanishing together.\"\n\nTrigger felt herself coloring. \"So don't take it,\" she said shortly.\n\"Just pop them one!\"\n\nThe smile returned. \"Wouldn't be gentlemanly to pop a lady, would it?\"\n\nShe smiled back. \"So stay away from the ladies!\" Somehow Brule and\nHolati Tate never had worked up a really warm regard for each other. It\nhad caused a little trouble before.\n\n\"Okay to tell me where you are?\" he asked.\n\n\"Afraid not, Brule.\"\n\n\"Precol Home Office apparently knows,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"Apparently,\" Trigger admitted.\n\nThey looked at each other a moment; then Brule grinned. \"Well, keep your\nlittle secret!\" he said. \"All I really want to know is when you're\ngetting back.\"\n\n\"Very soon, I hope, Brule,\" Trigger said unhappily. Then there was a\nsudden burst of sound from the ComWeb--gusts of laughing, chattering\nvoices; a faint wash of music. Brule glanced aside.\n\n\"Party going on,\" he explained. \"And here comes Nelauk! She wanted to\nsay hello to you.\"\n\nA dozen feet behind him, a figure strolled gracefully into view on the\nscreen and came forward. A slender girl with high-piled violet hair and\neyes that very nearly matched the hair's tint. She was dressed in\nsomething resembling a dozen blossoms--blossoms which, in Trigger's\nopinion, had been rather carelessly scattered. But presumably it was a\nvery elegant party costume. She was quite young, certainly not yet\ntwenty.\n\nBrule laid a brotherly hand on a powdered shoulder. \"Meet Trigger,\nNelauk!\"\n\nNelauk murmured it was indeed an honor, one she had long looked forward\nto. The violet eyes blinked sleepily at Trigger.\n\nTrigger gave her a great big smile. \"Thanks so much for arranging for\nthe call. I've been wondering how Brule was doing.\"\n\nWrong thing to say, probably, she thought. She was right. Nelauk reached\nfor it with no effort.\n\n\"Oh, he's doing wonderfully!\" she assured Trigger without expression.\n\"I'm keeping an eye on him. And this small favor--it was the very least\nI could do for Brule. For you, too, of course, Trigger dear.\"\n\nTrigger held the smile firmly.\n\n\"Thanks so much, again!\" she said.\n\nNelauk nodded, smiled back and drifted gracefully off the screen. Brule\nblew Trigger a kiss. \"They'll be cutting contact now. See you very, very\nsoon, Trigger, I hope.\"\n\nHis image vanished before she could answer.\n\nShe paced her office, muttering softly. She went over to the ComWeb\nonce, reached out toward it and drew her hand back again.\n\nBetter think this over.\n\nIt might not be an emergency. Brule didn't exactly chase women. He let\nthem chase him now and then. Long before she left Manon, Trigger had\ndiscovered without much surprise, that the wives, daughters and girl\nfriends of visiting Hub tycoons were as susceptible to the Inger charm\nas any Precol clerks. The main difference was that they were a lot more\ndirect about showing it.\n\nIt hadn't really worried her. In fact, she found Brule's slightly\nstartled reports of maneuverings of various amorous Hub ladies very\nentertaining. But she had put in a little worrying about something else.\nBrule's susceptibility seemed to be more to the overwhelming mass\ndisplay of wealth with which he was suddenly in almost constant contact.\nMany of the yachts he went flitting around among as Precol's\nrepresentative were elaborate spacegoing palaces, and it appeared Brule\nInger was soon regarded as a highly welcome guest on most of them.\n\nBrule talked about that a little too much.\n\nTrigger resumed her pacing.\n\nLittle Nelauk mightn't be twenty yet, but she'd flipped out a challenge\njust now with all the languid confidence of a veteran campaigner. Which,\nTrigger thought cattily, little Nelauk undoubtedly was.\n\nAnd a girl, she added cattily, whose father represented the Pluly Lines\ndid have some slight reason for confidence....\n\n\"Miaow!\" she reproved herself. Nelauk, to be honest about it, was also a\ndish.\n\nBut if she happened to be serious about Brule, the dish Brule might be\ntempted by was said Pluly Lines.\n\nTrigger went over to the window and looked down at the exercise\nquadrangle forty floors below.\n\n\"If he's that much of a meathead!\" she thought.\n\nHe could be that much of a meathead. He was also Brule. She went back to\nher desk and sat down. She looked at the ComWeb. A girl had a right to\nconsider her own interests.\n\nAnd there was the completely gruesome possibility now that Holati Tate\nmight call in at any moment, give her an entirely reasonable,\nsatisfactory, valid, convincing explanation for everything that had\nhappened lately--and then show her why it would be absolutely necessary\nfor her to stay here a while longer.\n\nIf it was a choice between inconveniencing Holati Tate and losing that\nmeathead Brule--\n\nTrigger switched on the ComWeb.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nThe head of the personnel department of Precol's Maccadon office said,\n\"You don't want me, Argee. That's not my jurisdiction. I'll connect you\nwith Undersecretary Rozan.\"\n\nTrigger blinked. \"Under--\" she began. But he'd already cut off.\n\nShe stared at the ComWeb, feeling a little shaken. All she'd done was to\nsay she wanted to apply for a transfer! Undersecretary Rozan was one of\nPrecol's Big Four. For a moment, Trigger had an uncanny notion. Some\nstrange madness was spreading insidiously through the Hub. She shook the\nthought off.\n\nA businesslike blonde showed up in the screen. She might be about\nthirty-five. She smiled a small, cold smile.\n\n\"Rozan,\" she said. \"You're Trigger Argee. I know about you. What's the\ntrouble?\"\n\nTrigger looked at her, wondering. \"No trouble,\" she said. \"Personnel\njust routed me through to you.\"\n\n\"They've been instructed to do so,\" said Rozan. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"I'm on detached duty at the moment.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"I'd like to apply for a transfer back to my previous job. The Manon\nSystem.\"\n\n\"That's your privilege,\" said Rozan. She half turned, swung a telewriter\nforward and snapped it into her ComWeb. She glanced out at Trigger's\ndesk. \"Your writer's connected, I see. We'll want thumbprint and\nsignature.\"\n\nShe slid a form into her telewriter, shifted it twice as Trigger\ndeposited thumbprint and signature and drew it out. \"The application\nwill be processed promptly, Argee. Good day.\"\n\nNot a gabby type, that Rozan.\n\nIf not gabby, the Precol blonde was a woman of her word. Trigger had\njust started lunch when the office mail-tube receiver tinkled brightly\nat her. She reached in, took out a flat plastic carrier, snapped it\nopen. The paper that unfolded itself in her hand was her retransfer\napplication.\n\nAt the bottom of the form was stamped \"Application Denied,\" followed by\nthe signature of the Secretary of the Department of Precolonization,\nHome Office, Evalee.\n\nTrigger's gaze shifted incredulously from the signature to the two\nwords, and back. They'd taken the trouble to get that signature\ntransmitted from Evalee just to make it clear that there were no heads\nleft to be gone over in the matter. Precol was not transferring her back\nto Manon. That was final. Then she realized that there was a second\nsheet attached to the application form.\n\nOn it in handwriting were a few more words: \"In accordance with the\ninstructions of Commissioner Tate.\" And a signature, \"Rozan.\" And three\nfinal words: \"Destroy this note.\"\n\nTrigger crumpled up the application in one hand. Her other hand darted\nto the ComWeb.\n\nThen she checked herself. To fire an as-of-now resignation back at\nPrecol had been the immediate impulse. But something, some vague warning\nchill, was saying it might be a very poor impulse to follow.\n\nShe sat back to think it over.\n\nIt was very probable that Undersecretary Rozan disliked Holati Tate\nintensely. A lot of the Home Office big shots disliked Holati Tate. He'd\nstamped on their toes more than once--very justifiably; but he'd\nstamped. The Home Office wouldn't go an inch out of its way to do\nsomething just because Commissioner Tate happened to want it done.\n\nSo somebody else was backing up Commissioner Tate's instructions.\n\nTrigger shook her head helplessly.\n\nThe only somebody else who _could_ give instructions to the\nPrecolonization Department was the Council of the Federation!\n\nAnd how could the Federation possibly care what Trigger Argee was doing?\nShe made a small, incredulous noise in her throat.\n\nThen she sat there a while, feeling frightened.\n\nThe fright didn't really wear off, but it settled down slowly inside\nher. Up on the surface she began to think again.\n\nAssume it's so, she instructed herself. It made no sense, but everything\nelse made even less sense. Just assume it's so. Set it up as a practical\nproblem. Don't worry about the why....\n\nThe problem became very simple then. She wanted to go to Manon. The\nFederation--or something else, something quite unthinkable at the moment\nbut comparable to the Federation in power and influence--wanted to keep\nher here.\n\nShe uncrumpled the application, detached Rozan's note, tore up the note\nand dropped its shreds into the wall disposal. That obligation was\ncancelled. She didn't have any other obligations. She'd liked Holati\nTate. When all this was cleared up, she might find she still liked him.\nAt the moment she didn't owe him a thing.\n\nNow. Assume they hadn't just blocked the obvious route to Manon. They\ncouldn't block all routes to everywhere; that was impossible. But they\ncould very well be watching to see that she didn't simply get up and\nwalk off. And they might be very well prepared to take quite direct\naction to stop her from doing it.\n\nShe would, Trigger decided, leave the method she'd use to get out of the\nColonial School unobserved to the last. That shouldn't present any\nserious difficulties.\n\nOnce she was outside, what would she do?\n\nPrincipally, she had to buy transportation. And that--since she had no\nintention of spending a few months on the trip, and since a private\ncitizen didn't have the ghost of a chance at squeezing aboard a\nFederation packet on the Manon run--was going to be expensive. In fact,\nit was likely to take the bulk of her savings. Under the circumstances,\nhowever, expense wasn't important. If Precol refused to give her back\nher job when she showed up on Manon, a number of the industrial outfits\npreparing to move in as soon as the plant got its final clearance would\nbe very happy to have her. She'd already turned down a dozen offers at\nconsiderably more than her present salary.\n\nSo ... she'd get off the school grounds, take a tube strip into downtown\nCeyce, step into a ComWeb booth, and call Grand Commerce transportation\nfor information on the earliest subspace runs to Manon.\n\nShe'd reserve a berth on the first fast boat out. In the name of--let's\nsee--in the name of Birna Drellgannoth, who had been a friend of hers\nwhen they were around the age of ten. Since Manon was a Precol preserve,\nshe wouldn't have to meet the problem of precise personal\nidentification, such as one ran into when booking passage to some of the\nmember worlds.\n\nThe ticket office would have her thumbprints then. That was unavoidable.\nBut there were millions of thumbprints being deposited every hour of the\nday on Maccadon. If somebody started checking for her by that method, it\nshould take them a good long while to sort out hers.\n\nNext stop--the Ceyce branch of the Bank of Maccadon. And it was lucky\nshe'd done all her banking in Ceyce since she was a teen-ager, because\nshe would have to present herself in person to draw out her savings.\nShe'd better lose no time getting to the bank either. It was one place\nwhere theoretical searchers could expect her to show up.\n\nShe could pay for her ship reservation at the bank. Then to a store for\nsome clothes and a suitcase for the trip....\n\nAnd, finally, into some big middle-class hotel where she would stay\nquietly until a few hours before the ship was due to take off.\n\nThat seemed to cover it. It probably wasn't foolproof. But trying to\nwork out a foolproof plan would be a waste of time when she didn't know\njust what she was up against. This should give her a running start, a\nlong one.\n\nWhen should she leave?\n\nRight now, she decided. Commissioner Tate presumably would be informed\nthat she had applied for a transfer and that the transfer had been\ndenied. He knew her too well not to become suspicious if it looked as if\nshe were just sitting there and taking it.\n\nShe got her secretary on the ComWeb.\n\n\"I'm thinking of leaving the office,\" she said. \"Anything for me to take\ncare of first?\"\n\nIt was a safe question. She'd signed the day's mail and checks before\nlunch.\n\n\"Not a thing, Miss Farn.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Ruya Farn. \"If anyone wants me in the next three or four\nhours, I'll be either down in the main library or out at the lake.\"\n\nAnd that would give somebody two rather extensive areas to look for her,\nif and when they started to look--along with the fact that, for all\nanyone knew, she might be anywhere between those two points.\n\nA few minutes later, Trigger sauntered, humming blithely, into her room\nand gave it a brief survey. There were some personal odds and ends she\nwould have liked to take with her, but she could send for them from\nManon.\n\nThe Denton, however, was coming along. The little gun had a very\nprecisely calibrated fast-acting stunner attachment, and old Runser\nArgee had instructed Trigger in its use with his customary thoroughness\nbefore he formally presented her with the gun. She had never had\noccasion to turn the stunner on a human being, but she'd used it on\ngame. If this cloak and dagger business became too realistic, she'd\nalready decided she would use it as needed.\n\nShe slipped the Denton into the side pocket of a lightweight rain robe,\ndraped the robe over her arm, slung her purse beside it, picked up the\nsun hat and left the room.\n\nThe Colonial School's kitchen area was on one of the underground levels.\nUnless they'd modified their guard system very considerably since\nTrigger had graduated, that was the route by which she would leave.\n\nAs far as she could tell they hadn't modified anything. The whole\nkitchen level looked so unchanged that she had a moment of nostalgia.\nGroups of students went chattering along the hallways between the\nstorerooms and the cooking and processing plants. The big mess hall,\nTrigger noticed in passing, smelled as good as it always had. Bells\nsounded the end of a period and a loudspeaker system began directing\nClass so and so to Room such and such. Standing around were a few\nuniformed guards--mainly for the purpose of helping out newcomers who\nhad lost their direction.\n\nShe came out on the equally familiar big and brightly lit platform of\nthe loading ramp. Some sixty or seventy great cylindrical vans floated\nalongside the platform, most of them disgorging their contents, some\nstill sealed.\n\nTrigger walked unhurriedly down the ramp, staying in the background,\nobserving the movements of two ramp guards and marking four vans which\nwere empty and looked ready to go.\n\nThe driver of the farthest of the four empties stood in the back of his\nvehicle, a few feet above the platform. When Trigger came level with\nhim, he was studying her. He was a big young man with tousled black hair\nand a rough-and-ready look. He was grinning very faintly. He knew the\nways of Colonial School students.\n\nTrigger raised her left hand a few inches, three fingers up. His grin\nwidened. He shook his head and raised both hands in a corresponding\ngesture. Eight fingers.\n\nTrigger frowned at him, stopped and looked back along the row of vans.\nThen left hand up again--four fingers and thumb.\n\nThe driver made a circle with finger and thumb. A deal, for five\nMaccadon crowns. Which was about standard fare for unauthorized passage\nout of the school.\n\nTrigger wandered on to the end of the platform, turned and came back,\nstill unhurriedly but now close to the edge of the ramp. Down the line,\nanother van slammed open in back and a stream of crates swooped out,\nriding a gravity beam from the roof toward a waiting storeroom carrier.\nThe guard closest to Trigger turned to watch the process. Trigger took\nsix quick steps and reached her driver.\n\nHe put down a hand to help her step up. She slipped the five-crown piece\ninto his palm.\n\n\"Up front,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Next to the driver's seat and keep\ndown. How far?\"\n\n\"Nearest tube line.\"\n\nHe grinned again and nodded. \"Can do.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later Trigger was in a downtown ComWeb booth. There had\nbeen a minor modification in her plans and she'd stopped off in a store\na few doors away and picked up a carefully nondescript street dress and\na scarf. She changed into the dress now and bundled the school costume\ninto a deposit box, which she dispatched to Central Deposit with a\none-crown piece, getting a numbered slip in return. It had occurred to\nher that there was a chance otherwise of getting caught in a Colonial\nSchool roundup, if it was brought to Doctor Plemponi's attention that\nthere appeared to be considerably more students out on the town at the\nmoment than could be properly overlooked.\n\nOr even, Trigger thought, if somebody simply happened to have missed\nTrigger Argee.\n\nShe slipped the rain robe over her shoulders, dropped a coin into the\nComWeb, and covered the silver-blonde hair with the scarf. The screen\nlit up. She asked for Grand Commerce Transportation.\n\nWaiting, she realized suddenly that so far she was rather enjoying\nherself. There had been a little argument with the van driver who, it\nturned out, had ideas of his own about modifying Trigger's plans--a\ncomplication she'd run into frequently in her school days too. As usual,\nit didn't develop into a very serious argument. Truckers who dealt with\nthe Colonial School knew, or learned in one or two briefly horrid\nlessons, that Mihul's commando-trained charges were prone to ungirlish\nmethods of discouragement when argued with too urgently.\n\nThe view screen switched on. The transportation clerk's glance flicked\nover Trigger's street dress when she told him her destination. His\nexpression remained bland. Yes, the Dawn City was leaving Ceyce Port for\nthe Manon System tomorrow evening. Yes, it was subspace express--one of\nthe newest and fastest, in fact. His eyes slipped over the dress again.\nAlso one of the most luxurious, he might add. There would be only two\nthree-hour stops in the Hub beyond Maccadon--one each off Evalee and\nGarth. Then a straight dive to Manon unless, of course, gravitic storm\nshifts forced the ship to surface temporarily. Average time for the Dawn\nCity on the run was eleven days; the slowest trip so far had required\nsixteen.\n\n\"But unfortunately, madam, there are only a very few cabins left--and\nnot very desirable ones, I'm afraid.\" He looked apologetic. \"There\nhasn't been a vacancy on the Manon run for the past three months.\"\n\n\"I can stand it, I imagine,\" Trigger said. \"How much for the cheapest?\"\n\nThe clerk cleared his throat gently and told her.\n\nShe couldn't help blinking, though she was braced for it. But it was\nmore than she had counted on. A great deal more. It would leave her, in\nfact, with exactly one hundred and twenty-six crowns out of her entire\nsavings, plus the coins she had in her purse.\n\n\"Any extras?\" she asked, a little hoarsely.\n\nHe shrugged. \"There's Traveler's Rest,\" he said negligently. \"Nine\nhundred for the three dive periods. But Rest is optional, of course.\nSome passengers prefer the experience of staying awake during a subspace\ndive.\" He smiled--rather sadistically, Trigger felt--and added, \"Till\nthey've lived through one of them, that is.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. She'd lived through quite a few of them. She didn't like\nsubspace particularly--nobody did--but except for an occasional touch of\nnausea or dizziness at the beginning of a dive, it didn't bother her\nmuch. Many people got hallucinations, went into states of panic or just\ngot very sick. \"Anything else?\" she asked.\n\n\"Just the usual tips and things,\" said the clerk. He looked surprised.\n\"Do you--does madam wish to make the reservation?\"\n\n\"Madam does,\" Trigger told him coldly. \"How long will it hold?\"\n\nIt would be good up to an hour before take-off time, she learned. If not\nclaimed then, it would be filled from the last-minute waiting list.\n\nShe left the booth thoughtfully. At least the Dawn City would be leaving\nin less than twenty-six hours. She wouldn't have to spend much of her\nremaining capital before she got off Maccadon.\n\nShe'd skip meals, she decided. Except breakfast next morning, which\nwould be covered by her hotel room fee.\n\nAnd it wasn't going to be any middle-class hotel.\n\nThere was no one obviously waiting for her at the Bank of Maccadon. In\nfact, since that venerable institution covered a city block, with\nentrances running up from the street level to the fifty-eighth floor, a\nsmall army would have been needed to make sure of spotting her.\n\nShe had to identify herself to get into the vaults, but there was a\nsolution to that. Seven years ago when Runser Argee died suddenly and\nshe had to get his property and records straightened out, a gray-haired\nlittle vault attendant with whom she dealt with had taken a fatherly\ninterest in her. When she saw he was still on the job, Trigger was\ncertain the matter would go off all right.\n\nIt did. He didn't take a really close look at her until she shoved her\nsignature and Federation identification in front of him. Then his head\nbobbed up briskly. His eyes lit up.\n\n\"Trigger!\" He bounced out of his chair. His right hand shot out. \"Good\nto see you again! I've been hearing about you.\"\n\nThey shook hands. She put a finger to her lips. \"I'm here incog!\" she\ncautioned in a low voice. \"Can you handle this quietly?\"\n\nThe faded blue eyes widened slightly, but he asked no questions. Trigger\nArgee's name was known rather widely, as a matter of fact, particularly\non her home world. And as he remembered Trigger, she wasn't a girl who'd\ngo look for a spotlight to stand in.\n\nHe nodded. \"Sure can!\" He glanced suspiciously at the nearest customers,\nthen looked down at what Trigger had written. He frowned. \"You drawing\nout everything? Not leaving Ceyce for good, are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Trigger said. \"I'll be back. This is just a temporary emergency.\"\n\nThat was all the explaining she had to do. Four minutes later she had\nher money. Three minutes after that she had paid for the Dawn City\nreservation as Birna Drellgannoth and deposited her thumbprints with the\nticket office. Counting what was left, she found it came to just under a\nhundred and thirty-eight.\n\nDefinitely no dinner tonight! She needed a suitcase and a change of\nclothing. And then she'd just better go sit in that hotel room.\n\nThe street level traffic was moderate around the bank, but it began to\nthicken as she approached a shopping center two blocks farther on.\nStriding along, neither hurrying nor idling, Trigger decided she had it\nmade. The only real chance to catch up with her had been at the bank.\nAnd the old vault attendant wouldn't talk.\n\nHalf a block from the shopping center, a row of spacers on planet-leave\ncame rollicking cheerily toward her, uniform jackets unbuttoned, three\nCeyce girls in arm-linked formation among them, all happily high.\nTrigger shifted toward the edge of the sidewalk to let them pass. As the\nline swayed up on her left, there was a shadowy settling of an aircar at\nthe curb to her right.\n\nWith loud outcries of glad recognition and whoops of laughter, the line\nswung in about her, close. Bodies crowded against her; a hand was\nclapped over her mouth. Other hands held her arms. Her feet came off the\nground and she had a momentary awareness of being rushed expertly\nforward.\n\nThen she was in the car, half on her side over the rear seat, two very\nstrong hands clamping her wrists together behind her back. As she sucked\nin her breath for a yell, the door snapped shut behind her, cutting off\nthe rollicking \"ha-ha-ha's\" and other noises outside.\n\nThere was a lurching twist as the aircar shot upward.\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nThe man who held Trigger's wrists shifted his grip up her arms, and\nturned her a little so that she could sit upright on the seat, faced\nhalf away from him. She had got only a glimpse of him as he caught her,\nbut he seemed to be wearing the same kind of commercial spacer's uniform\nas the group which had hustled her into the car. The other man in the\ncar, the driver, sat up front with his back to them. He looked like any\nordinary middle-aged civilian.\n\nTrigger let her breath out slowly. There was no point in yelling now.\nShe could feel her legs tremble a little, but she didn't seem to be\nactually frightened. At least, not yet.\n\n\"Spot anything so far?\" the man who held her asked. It was a deep voice.\nIt sounded matter-of-fact, quite unexcited.\n\n\"Three possibles anyway,\" the driver said with equal casualness. He\ndidn't turn his head. \"Make it two.... One very definite possible now,\nI'd say!\"\n\n\"Better feed it to her then.\"\n\nThe driver didn't reply, but the car's renewed surge of power pushed\nTrigger down hard on the seat. She couldn't see much more than a\nshifting piece of the sky line through the front view plate. Their own\ncar seemed to be rising at a tremendous rate. They were probably, she\nthought, already above the main traffic arteries over Ceyce.\n\n\"Now, Miss Argee,\" the man sitting beside her said, \"I'd like to\nreassure you a little first.\"\n\n\"Go ahead and reassure me,\" Trigger said unsteadily.\n\n\"You're in no slightest danger from us,\" he said. \"We're your friends.\"\n\n\"Nice friends!\" remarked Trigger.\n\n\"I'll explain it all in a couple of minutes. There may be some fairly\ndangerous characters on our tail at the moment, and if they start to\ncatch up--\"\n\n\"Which they seem to be doing,\" the driver interrupted. \"Hang on for a\nfew fast turns when we hit the next cloud bank.\"\n\n\"We'll probably shake them there,\" the other man explained to Trigger.\n\"In case we don't though, I'll need both hands free to handle the guns.\"\n\n\"So?\" she asked.\n\n\"So I'd like to slip a set of cuffs on you for just a few minutes. I've\nbeen informed you're a fairly tricky lady, and we don't want you to do\nanything thoughtless. You won't have them on very long. All right?\"\n\nTrigger bit her lip. It wasn't all right, and she didn't feel at all\nreassured so far.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" she said.\n\nHe let go of her left arm, presumably to reach for the handcuffs. She\ntwisted around on him and went into fast action.\n\nShe was fairly proficient at the practice of unarmed mayhem. The trouble\nwas that the big ape she was trying the stuff on seemed at least as\nadept and with twice her muscle. She lost a precious instant finding out\nthat the Denton was no longer in her robe pocket. After that she never\ngot back the initiative. It didn't help either that the car suddenly\nseemed to be trying to fly in three directions at once.\n\nAll in all, about forty seconds passed before she was plumped back on\nthe seat, her hands behind her again, linked at the wrists by the smooth\nplastic cords of the cuffs. The ape stood behind the driver, his hands\nresting on the back of the seat. He wasn't, Trigger observed bitterly,\neven breathing hard. The view plate was full of the cottony whiteness of\na cloud heart. They seemed to be dropping again.\n\nOne more violent swerve and they came flashing out into wet gray\ncloud-shadow and on into brilliant sunlight.\n\nA few seconds passed. Then the ape remarked, \"Looks like you lost them,\nchum.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said the driver. \"Almost at the river now. I'll turn north\nthere and drop down.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said the ape. \"Get us that far and we'll be out of trouble.\"\n\nA few minutes passed in silence. Presently Trigger sensed they were\nslowing and losing altitude. Then a line of trees flashed by in the view\nplate. \"Nice flying!\" the ape said. He punched the driver approvingly in\nthe shoulder and turned back to Trigger.\n\nThey looked at each other for a few seconds. He was tall, dark-eyed,\nvery deeply tanned, with thick sloping shoulders. He probably wasn't\nmore than five or six years older than she was. He was studying her\ncuriously, and his eyes were remarkably steady. Something stirred in her\nfor a moment, a small chill of fear. Something passed through her\nthoughts, a vague odd impression, like a half aroused memory, of huge,\ncold, dangerous things far away. It was gone before she could grasp it\nmore clearly. She frowned.\n\nThe ape smiled. It wasn't, Trigger saw, an entirely unpleasant face.\n\"Sorry the party got rough,\" he said. \"Will you give parole if I take\nthose cuffs off and tell you what this is about?\"\n\nShe studied him again. \"Better tell me first,\" she said shortly.\n\n\"All right. We're taking you to Commissioner Tate. We'll be there in\nabout an hour. He'll tell you himself why he wanted to see you.\"\n\nTrigger's eyes narrowed for an instant. Secretly she felt very much\nrelieved. Holati Tate, at any rate, wouldn't let anything really\nunpleasant happen to her--and she would find out at last what had been\ngoing on.\n\n\"You've got an odd way of taking people places,\" she observed.\n\nHe laughed. \"The grabber party wasn't scheduled. You'd indicated you\nwanted to speak to the Commissioner. We were sent to the Colonial School\nto pick you up and escort you to him. When we found out you'd\ndisappeared, we had to do some fast improvising. Not my business to tell\nyou the reasons for that.\"\n\nTrigger said hesitantly, \"Those people who were chasing this car--\"\n\n\"What about them?\" he asked thoughtfully.\n\n\"Were they after _me_?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"they weren't after me. Better let the Commissioner\ntell you about that, too. Now--how about parole?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Till you turn me over to the Commissioner.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" he said. \"You're his problem then.\" He took a small flat\npiece of metal out of a pocket and reached back of her with it. He\ndidn't seem to do more than touch the cuffs, but she felt the slick\ncoils loosen and drop away.\n\nTrigger rubbed her wrists. \"Where's my gun?\" she asked.\n\n\"I've got it. I'll give it to the Commissioner.\"\n\n\"How did you people find me so fast?\"\n\n\"Police keep bank entrances under twenty-four hour visual survey. We had\nsomeone watching their screens. You were spotted going in.\" He sat down\ncompanionably beside her. \"I'd introduce myself, but I don't know if\nthat would fit in with the Commissioner's plans.\"\n\nTrigger shrugged. It still was quite possible, she decided, that her own\nplans weren't completely spoiled. Holati and his friends didn't\nnecessarily know about that vault account. If they did know she'd had\none and had closed it out, they could make a pretty good guess at what\nshe'd done with the money. But if she just kept quiet, there might be an\nopportunity to get back to Ceyce and the Dawn City by tomorrow evening.\n\n\"Cigarette?\" the Commissioner's overmuscled henchman inquired amiably.\n\nTrigger glanced at him from the side. Not amiably. \"No, thanks.\"\n\n\"No hard feelings, are there?\" He looked surprised.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said evenly. \"There are.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" the driver suggested from the front, \"what Miss Argee could do\nwith is a shot of Puya. Flask's in my coat pocket. Left side.\"\n\n\"There's an idea,\" remarked Trigger's companion. He looked at her. \"It's\nvery good Puya.\"\n\n\"So choke on it,\" Trigger told him gently. She settled back into the\ncorner of the seat and closed her eyes. \"You can wake me up when we get\nto the Commissioner.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In some way,\" Holati Tate said, \"this little item here seems to be at\nthe core of the whole plasmoid problem. Know what it is?\"\n\nTrigger looked at the little item with some revulsion. Dark green,\nmarbled with pink streakings, it lay on the table between them, rather\nlike a plump leech a foot and a half long. It was motionless except that\nthe end nearest her shifted in a short arc from side to side, as if the\nthing suffered from a very slow twitch.\n\n\"One of the plasmoids obviously,\" she said. \"A jumpy one.\" She blinked\nat it. \"Looks like that 113. Is it?\"\n\nShe glanced around. Commissioner Tate and Professor Mantelish, who sat\nin an armchair off to her right, were staring at her, eyebrows up,\napparently surprised about something. \"What's the matter?\" she asked.\n\n\"We're just wondering,\" said Holati, \"how you happen to remember 113, in\nparticular, out of the thousands of plasmoids on Harvest Moon.\"\n\n\"Oh. One of the Junior Scientists on your Project mentioned the 112-113\nunit. That brought it to mind. Is this 113?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Holati Tate. \"But it appears to be a duplicate of it.\" He was\na mild-looking little man, well along in years, sparse and spruce in his\nPrecol uniform. The small gray eyes in the sun-darkened, leathery face\nweren't really mild, if you considered them more closely, or if you knew\nthe Commissioner.\n\n\"Have to fill you in on some of the background first, Trigger girl,\"\nhe'd said, when she was brought to his little private office and\ninquired with some heat what the devil was up. The tall grabber hadn't\ncome into the office with her. He asked the Commissioner from the door\nwhether he should get Professor Mantelish to the conference room, and\nthe Commissioner nodded. Then the door closed and the two of them were\nalone.\n\n\"I know it's looked odd,\" Commissioner Tate admitted, \"but the\ncircumstances have been very odd. Still are. And I didn't want to worry\nyou any more than I had to.\"\n\nTrigger, unmollified, pointed out that the methods he'd used not to\nworry her hardly had been soothing.\n\n\"I know that, too,\" said the Commissioner. \"But if I'd told you\neverything immediately, you would have had reason enough to be worried\nfor the past two months, rather than just for a day or so. The situation\nhas improved now, very considerably. In fact, in another few days you\nshouldn't have any more reason to worry at all.\" He smiled briefly. \"At\nleast, no more than the rest of us.\"\n\nTrigger felt a bit dry-lipped suddenly. \"I do at present?\" she asked.\n\n\"You did till today. There's been some pretty heavy heat on you, Trigger\ngirl. We're switching most of it off tonight. For good, I think.\"\n\n\"You mean some heat will be left?\"\n\n\"In a way,\" he said. \"But that should be cleared up too in the next\nthree or four days. Anyway we can drop most of the mystery act tonight.\"\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"It isn't being dropped very fast!\" she\nobserved.\n\n\"I told you I couldn't tell it backwards,\" the Commissioner said\npatiently. \"All right if we start filling in the background now?\"\n\n\"I guess we'd better,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Commissioner Tate. He got to his feet. \"Then let's go join\nMantelish.\"\n\n\"Why the professor?\"\n\n\"He could help a lot with the explaining. If he's in the mood. Anyway\nhe's got a kind of pet I'd like you to look at.\"\n\n\"A pet!\" cried Trigger. She shook her head again and stood up\nresignedly. \"Lead on, Commissioner!\"\n\nThey joined Mantelish and his plasmoid weirdie in what looked like the\ndining room of what had looked like an old-fashioned hunting lodge when\nthe aircar came diving down on it between two ice-sheeted mountain\npeaks. Trigger wasn't sure in just what section of the main continent\nthey were; but there were only two or three alternatives--it was high in\nthe mountains, and night came a lot faster here than it did around\nCeyce.\n\nShe greeted Mantelish and sat down at the table. Then the Commissioner\nlocked the doors and introduced her to the professor's pet.\n\n\"It's labelled 113-A,\" he said now. \"Even the professor isn't certain he\ncould distinguish between the two. Right, Mantelish?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Mantelish, \"at present.\" He was a very big, rather\nfat but healthy-looking old man with a thick thatch of white hair and a\nruddy face. \"Without a physical comparison--\" He shrugged.\n\n\"What's so important about the critter?\" Trigger asked, eyeing the leech\nagain. One good thing about it, she thought--it wasn't equipped to eye\nher back.\n\n\"It goes back to the time,\" the Commissioner said, \"when Mantelish and\nFayle and Azol were conducting the first League investigation of the\nplasmoids on Harvest Moon. You recall the situation?\"\n\n\"If you mean their attempts to get the things to show some signs of\nlife, I do, naturally.\"\n\n\"One of them got lively enough for poor old Azol, didn't it?\" Professor\nMantelish rumbled from his armchair.\n\nTrigger grimaced. Doctor Azol's fate might be one of the things that had\ngiven her a negative attitude towards plasmoids. With Mantelish and\nDoctor Gess Fayle, Azol had been the third of the three big U-League\nboys in charge of the initial investigation on Harvest Moon. As she\nremembered it, it was Azol who discovered that Plasmoids occasionally\ncould be induced to absorb food. Almost any kind of food, it turned out,\nso long as it contained a sufficient quantity of protein. What had\nhappened to Azol looked like a particularly unfortunate result of the\ndiscovery. It was assumed an untimely coronary had been the reason he\nhad fallen helplessly into the feeding trough of one of the largest\nplasmoids. By the time he was found, all of him from the knees on up\nalready had been absorbed.\n\n\"I meant your efforts to get them to work,\" she said.\n\nCommissioner Tate looked at Mantelish. \"You tell her about that part of\nit,\" he suggested.\n\nMantelish shook his head. \"I'd get too technical,\" he said resignedly.\n\"I always do. At least they say so. You tell her.\"\n\nBut Holati Tate's eyes had shifted suddenly to the table. \"Hey, now!\" he\nsaid in a low voice.\n\nTrigger followed his gaze. After a moment she made a soft, sucking\nsound of alarmed distaste.\n\n\"Ugh!\" she remarked. \"It's moving!\"\n\n\"So it is,\" Holati said.\n\n\"Towards me!\" said Trigger. \"I think--\"\n\n\"Don't get startled. Mantelish!\"\n\nMantelish already was coming up slowly behind Trigger's chair. \"Don't\nmove!\" he cautioned her.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Trigger.\n\n\"Hush, my dear.\" Mantelish laid a large, heavy hand on each of her\nshoulders and bore down slightly. \"It's sensitive! This is very\ninteresting. Very.\"\n\nPerhaps it was. She kept watching the plasmoid. It had thinned out\nsomewhat and was gliding very slowly but very steadily across the table.\nDefinitely in her direction.\n\n\"Ho-ho!\" said Mantelish in a thunderous murmur. \"Perhaps it likes you,\nTrigger! Ho-ho!\" He seemed immensely pleased.\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said helplessly, \"I don't like it!\" She wriggled\nslightly under Mantelish's hands. \"And I'd sooner get out of this\nchair!\"\n\n\"Don't be childish, Trigger,\" said the professor annoyedly. \"You're\nbehaving as if it were, in some manner, offensive.\"\n\n\"It is,\" she said.\n\n\"Hush, my dear,\" Mantelish said absently, putting on a little more\npressure. Trigger hushed resignedly. They watched. In about a minute,\nthe gliding thing reached the edge of the table. Trigger gathered\nherself to duck out from under Mantelish's hands and go flying out of\nthe chair if it looked as if the plasmoid was about to drop into her\nlap.\n\nBut it stopped. For a few seconds it lay motionless. Then it gradually\nraised its front end and began waving it gently back and forth in the\nair. At her, Trigger suspected.\n\n\"Yipes!\" she said, horrified.\n\nThe front end sank back. The plasmoid lay still again. After a minute it\nwas still lying still.\n\n\"Show's over for the moment, I guess,\" said the Commissioner.\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" said Professor Mantelish. His big hands went away from\nTrigger's aching shoulders. \"You startled it, Trigger!\" he boomed at\nher accusingly.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nThe point of it, Holati Tate explained, was that this had been more\nactivity than 113-A normally displayed over a period of a week. And\n113-A was easily the most active plasmoid of them all nowadays.\n\n\"It is, of course, possible,\" Mantelish said, arousing from deep\nthought, \"that it was attracted by your body odor.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mantelish!\" said Trigger.\n\n\"You're welcome, my dear.\" Mantelish had pulled his chair up to the\ntable; he hitched himself forward in it. \"We shall now,\" he announced,\n\"try a little experiment. Pick it up, Trigger.\"\n\nShe stared at him. \"Pick it up! No, Mantelish. We shall now try some\nother little experiment.\"\n\nMantelish furrowed his Jovian brows. Holati gave her a small smile\nacross the table. \"Just touch it with the tip of a finger,\" he\nsuggested. \"You can do that much for the professor, can't you?\"\n\n\"Barely,\" Trigger told him grimly. But she reached out and put a\ncautious finger tip to the less lively end of 113-A. After a moment she\nsaid, \"Hey!\" She moved the finger lightly along the thing's surface. It\nhad a velvety, smooth, warm feeling, rather like a kitten. \"You know,\"\nshe said surprised, \"it feels sort of nice! It just looks disgusting.\"\n\n\"Disgusting!\" Mantelish boomed, offended again.\n\nThe Commissioner held up a hand. \"Just a moment,\" he said. He'd picked\nup some signal Trigger hadn't noticed, for he went over to the wall now\nand touched something there. A release button apparently. The door to\nthe room opened. Trigger's grabber came in. The door closed behind him.\nHe was carrying a tray with a squat brown flask and four rather small\nglasses on it.\n\nHe gave Trigger a grin. She gave him a tentative smile in return. The\nCommissioner had introduced him: Heslet Quillan--Major Heslet Quillan,\nof the Subspace Engineers. For a Subspace Engineer, Trigger had thought\nskeptically, he was a pretty good grabber. But there was a qualified\ntruce in the room. It would last, at least, until Holati finished his\nexplaining. There was no really good reason not to include Major Quillan\nin it.\n\n\"Ah, Puya!\" Professor Mantelish exclaimed, advancing on the tray as\nQuillan set it on the table. Mantelish seemed to have forgotten about\nplasmoid experiments for the moment, and Trigger didn't intend to remind\nhim. She drew her hand back quietly from 113-A. The professor\nunstoppered the flask. \"You'll have some, Trigger, I'm sure? The only\nreally good thing the benighted world of Rumli ever produced.\"\n\n\"My great-grandmother,\" Trigger remarked, \"was a Rumlian.\" She watched\nhim fill the four glasses with a thin purple liquid. \"I've never tried\nit; but yes, thanks.\"\n\nQuillan put one of the glasses in front of her.\n\n\"And we shall drink,\" Mantelish suggested, with a suave flourish of his\nPuya, \"to your great-grandmother!\"\n\n\"We shall also,\" suggested Major Quillan, pulling a chair up to the\ntable for himself, \"Advise Trigger to take a very small sip on her first\ngo at the stuff.\"\n\nNobody had invited him to sit down. But nobody was objecting either.\nWell, that fitted, Trigger thought.\n\nShe sipped. It was tart and hot. Very hot. She set the glass back on the\ntable, inhaled with difficulty, exhaled quiveringly. Tears gathered in\nher eyes.\n\n\"Very good!\" she husked.\n\n\"Very good,\" the Commissioner agreed. He put down his empty glass and\nsmacked his lips lightly. \"And now,\" he said briskly, \"let's get on with\nthis conference.\"\n\nTrigger glanced around the room while Quillan refilled three glasses.\nThe small live coal she had swallowed was melting away; a warm glow\nbegan to spread through her. It did look like the dining room of a\nhunting lodge. The woodwork was dark, old-looking, worn with much\npolishing. Horned heads of various formidable Maccadon life-forms\nadorned the walls.\n\nBut it was open season now on a different kind of game. Three men had\nwalked briskly past them when Quillan brought her in by the front door.\nThey hadn't even looked at her. There were sounds now and then from some\nof the other rooms, and that general feeling of a considerable number of\npeople around--of being at an operating headquarters of some sort, which\nhummed with quiet activity.\n\nOne of the things, Holati Tate said, which had not become public\nknowledge so far was that Professor Mantelish actually succeeded in\ngetting some of the plasmoids on the Old Galactic base back into\noperation. One plasmoid in particular.\n\nThe reason the achievement hadn't been announced was that for nearly six\nweeks no one except the three men directly involved in the experiments\nhad known about them. And during that time other things occurred which\nmade subsequent publicity seem very inadvisable.\n\nMantelish scowled. \"We made up a report to the League the day of the\ninitial discovery,\" he informed Trigger. \"It was a complete and detailed\nreport!\"\n\n\"True,\" Holati said, \"but the report the U-League got didn't happen to\nbe the one Professor Mantelish helped make up. We'll go into that later.\nThe plasmoid the professor was experimenting with was the 112-113 unit.\"\n\n\nHe shifted his gaze to Mantelish. \"Still want me to tell it?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" Mantelish said impatiently. \"You will oversimplify grossly,\nof course, but it should do for the moment. At a more leisurely time I\nshall be glad to give Trigger an accurate description of the processes.\"\n\nTrigger smiled at him. \"Thank you, Professor!\" She took her second sip\nof the Puya. Not bad.\n\n\"Well, Mantelish was dosing this plasmoid with mild electrical\nstimulations,\" Holati went on. \"He noticed suddenly that as he did it\nother plasmoids in that section of Harvest Moon were indicating signs of\nactivity. So he called in Doctor Fayle and Doctor Azol.\"\n\nThe three scientists discovered quickly that stimulation of the 112 part\nof the unit was in fact producing random patterns of plasmoid motion\nthroughout the entire base, while an electrical prod at 113 brought\neverything to an abrupt stop again. After a few hours of this, 112\nsuddenly extruded a section of its material, which detached itself and\nmoved off slowly under its own power through half the station, trailed\nwith great excitement by Mantelish and Azol. It stopped at a point where\nanother plasmoid had been removed for laboratory investigations, climbed\nup and settled down in the place left vacant by its predecessor. It then\nreshaped itself into a copy of the predecessor, and remained where it\nwas. Obviously a replacement.\n\nThere was dignified scientific jubilation among the three. This was\nprecisely the kind of information the U-League--and everybody else--had\nbeen hoping to obtain. 112-113 tentatively could be assumed to be a kind\nof monitor of the station's activities. It could be induced to go into\naction and to activate the other plasmoids. With further observation and\nrefinement of method, its action undoubtedly could be shifted from the\nrandom to the purposeful. Finally, and most importantly, it had shown\nitself capable of producing a different form of plasmoid life to fulfill\na specific requirement.\n\nIn essence, the riddles presented by the Old Galactic Station appeared\nto be solved.\n\nThe three made up their secret report to the U-League. Included was a\nrecommendation to authorize distribution of ten per cent of the less\nsignificant plasmoids to various experimental centers in the Hub--the\nbig and important centers which had been bringing heavy political\npressure to bear on the Federation to let them in on the investigation.\nThat should keep them occupied, while the U-League concluded the really\nimportant work.\n\n\"Next day,\" said Holati, \"Doctor Gess Fayle presented Mantelish with a\ntransmitted message from U-League Headquarters. It contained\ninstructions to have Fayle mount the 112-113 unit immediately in one of\nthe League ships at Harvest Moon and bring it quietly to Maccadon.\"\n\nMantelish frowned. \"The message was faked!\" he boomed.\n\n\"Not only that,\" said Holati. \"The actual report Doctor Fayle had\ntransmitted the day before to the League was revised to the extent that\nit omitted any reference to 112-113.\" He glanced thoughtfully at\nMantelish. \"As a matter of fact, it was almost a month and a half before\nLeague Headquarters became aware of the importance of the unit.\"\n\nThe professor snorted. \"Azol,\" he explained to Trigger, \"had become a\nvictim of his scientific zeal. And I--\"\n\n\"Doctor Azol,\" said the Commissioner, \"as you may remember, had his\nlittle mishap with the plasmoid just two days after Fayle departed.\"\n\n\"And I,\" Mantelish went on, \"was involved in other urgent research. How\nwas I to know what that villain Fayle had been up to? A vice president\nof the University League!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said, \"what had Doctor Fayle been up to?\"\n\n\"We don't know yet,\" Holati told her. \"Obviously he had something in\nmind with the faked order and the alteration of the report. But the only\nthing we can say definitely is that he disappeared on the League ship he\nhad requisitioned, along with its personnel and the 112-113 plasmoid,\nand hasn't shown up again.\n\n\"And that plasmoid unit now appears to have been almost certainly the\nkey unit of the entire Old Galactic Station--the unit that kept\neverything running along automatically there for thirty thousand years.\"\n\nHe glanced at Quillan. \"Someone at the door. We'll hold it while you\nsee what they want.\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nThe burly character who had appeared at the door said diffidently that\nProfessor Mantelish had wanted to be present while his lab equipment was\nstowed aboard. If the professor didn't mind, things were about that far\nalong.\n\nMantelish excused himself and went off with the messenger. The door\nclosed. Quillan came back to his chair.\n\n\"We're moving the outfit later tonight,\" the Commissioner explained.\n\"Mantelish is coming along--plus around eight tons of his lab equipment.\nPlus his special U-League guards.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Trigger picked up the Puya glass. She looked into it. It was\nempty. \"Moving where?\" she asked.\n\n\"Manon,\" said the Commissioner. \"Tell you about that later.\"\n\nEvery last muscle in Trigger's body seemed to go limp simultaneously.\nShe settled back slightly in the chair, surprised by the force of the\nreaction. She hadn't realized by now how keyed up she was! She sighed a\nsmall sigh. Then she smiled at Quillan.\n\n\"Major,\" she said, \"how about a tiny little refill on that Puya--about\nhalf?\"\n\nQuillan took care of the tiny little refill.\n\nCommissioner Tate said, \"By the way, Quillan does have a degree in\nsubspace engineering and gets assigned to the Engineers now and then.\nBut his real job's Space Scout Intelligence.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"I'd almost guessed it!\" She gave Quillan another smile.\nShe nearly gave 113-A a smile.\n\n\"And now,\" said the Commissioner, \"we'll talk more freely. We tell\nMantelish just as little as we can. To tell you the truth, Trigger, the\nprofessor is a terrible handicap on an operation like this. I understand\nhe was a great friend of your father's.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Going over for visits to Mantelish's garden with my\nfather is one of the earliest things I remember. I can imagine he's a\nproblem!\" She shifted her gaze curiously from one to the other of the\ntwo men. \"What are you people doing? Looking for Gess Fayle and the key\nunit?\"\n\nHolati Tate said, \"That's about it. We're one of a few thousand\nFederation groups assigned to the same general job. Each group works at\nits specialties, and the information gets correlated.\" He paused. \"The\nFederation Council--they're the ones we're working for directly--the\nCouncil's biggest concern is the very delicate political situation\nthat's involved. They feel it could develop suddenly into a dangerous\none. They may be right.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Well, suppose that key unit is lost and stays lost. Suppose all the\nother plasmoids put together don't contain enough information to show\nhow the Old Galactics produced the things and got them to operate.\"\n\n\"Somebody would get that worked out pretty soon, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily, or even probably, according to Mantelish and some\nother people who know what's happened. There seem to be too many basic\nfactors missing. It might be necessary to develop a whole new class of\nsciences first. And that could take a few centuries.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger admitted, \"I could get along without the things\nindefinitely.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" the plasmoid nabob agreed ungratefully. \"Weird beasties!\nBut--let's see. At present there are twelve hundred and fifty-eight\nmember worlds to the Federation, aren't there?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\n\"And the number of planetary confederacies, subplanetary governments,\nindustrial, financial and commercial combines, assorted power groups,\netc. and so on, is something I'd hate to have to calculate.\"\n\n\"What are you driving at?\" she asked.\n\n\"They've all been told we're heading for a new golden age, courtesy of\nthe plasmoid science. Practically everybody has believed it. Now there's\nconsiderable doubt.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"Of course--practically everybody is going to get very\nunhappy, eh?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Commissioner Tate, \"is only a little of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, the thing isn't just lost. Somebody's got it.\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Fayle's ship might have got wrecked accidentally, of\ncourse. But the way he took off shows he planned to disappear--a\ncrack-up on top of that would be too much of a coincidence. So any one\nof umpteen thousands of organizations in the Hub might be the one that\nhas that plasmoid now!\"\n\n\"Including,\" said Holati, \"any one of the two hundred and fourteen\nrestricted worlds. Their treaties of limitation wouldn't have let them\nget into the plasmoid pie until the others had been at it a decade or\nso. They would have been quite eager....\"\n\nThere was a little pause. Then Trigger said, \"Lordy! The thing could\neven set off another string of wars--\"\n\n\"That's a point the Council is nervous about,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, it certainly is a mess. You would have thought the Federation\nmight have had a Security Chief in on that first operation. Right there\non Harvest Moon!\"\n\n\"They did,\" he said. \"It was Fayle.\"\n\n\"Oh! Pretty embarrassing.\" Trigger was silent a moment. \"Holati, could\nthose things ever become as valuable as people keep saying? It's all\nsounded a little exaggerated to me.\"\n\nThe Commissioner said he'd wondered about it too. \"I'm not enough of a\nbiologist to make an educated guess. What it seems to boil down to is\nthat they might. Which would be enough to tempt a lot of people to\ngamble very high for a chance to get control of the plasmoid\nprocess--and we know definitely that some people are gambling for it.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"We've been working a couple of leads here. Pretty short leads so far,\nbut you work with what you can get.\" He nodded at the table. \"We picked\nup the first lead through 113-A.\"\n\nTrigger glanced down. The plasmoid lay there some inches from the side\nof her hand. \"You know,\" she said uncomfortably, \"old Repulsive moved\nagain while we were talking! Towards my hand.\" She drew the hand away.\n\n\"I was watching it,\" Major Quillan said reassuringly from the end of the\ntable. \"I would have warned you, but it stopped when it got as far as it\nis now. That was around five minutes ago.\"\n\nTrigger reached back and gave old Repulsive a cautious pat. \"Very lively\ncharacter! He does feel pleasant to touch. Kitty-cat pleasant! How did\nyou get a lead through him?\"\n\n\"Mantelish brought it back to Maccadon with him, mainly because of its\nsimilarity to 113. He was curious because he couldn't even guess at what\nits function was. It was just lying there in a cubicle. So he did\nconsiderable experimenting with it while he waited for Gess Fayle to\nshow up--and League Headquarters fidgeted around, hoping to get the\nkind of report from Mantelish and Fayle that Mantelish thought they'd\nalready received. They were wondering where Fayle was, too. But they\nknew Fayle was Security, so they didn't like to get too nosy.\"\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"Wonderful! So what happened with 113-A?\"\n\n\"Mantelish began to get results with it,\" the Commissioner said. \"One\nexperiment was rather startling. He'd been trying that electrical\nstimulation business. Nothing happened until he had finished. Then he\ntouched the plasmoid, and it fed the whole charge back to him.\nApparently it was a fairly hefty dose.\"\n\nShe laughed delightedly. \"Good for Repulsive! Stood up for his rights,\neh?\"\n\n\"Mantelish gained some such impression anyway. He became more cautious\nwith it after that. And then he learned something that should be\nimportant. He was visiting another lab where they had a couple of\nplasmoids which actually moved now and then. He had 113-A in his coat\npocket. The two lab plasmoids stopped moving while he was there. They\nhaven't moved since.\"\n\n\"Like the Harvest Moon plasmoids when they stimulated 113?\"\n\n\"Right. He thought about that, and then located another moving plasmoid.\nHe dropped in to look it over, with 113-A in his pocket again, and it\nstopped. He did the same thing in one more place and then quit. There\naren't that many moving plasmoids around. Those three labs are still\nwondering what hit their specimens.\"\n\nShe studied 113-A curiously. \"A mighty mite! What does Mantelish make of\nit?\"\n\n\"He thinks the 112-113 unit forms a kind of self-regulating system. The\nbig one induces plasmoid activity, the little one modifies it. This\n113-A might be a spare regulator. But it seems to be more than a\nspare--which brings us to that first lead we got. A gang of raiders\ncrashed Mantelish's lab one night.\"\n\n\"When was that?\"\n\n\"Some months ago. Before you and I left Manon. The professor was out,\nand 113-A had gone along in his pocket as usual. But his two lab guards\nand one of the raiders were killed. The others got away. Gess Fayle's\ndefection was a certainty by then, and everybody was very nervous. The\nFeds got there, fast, and dead-brained the raider. They learned just two\nthings. One, he'd been mind-blocked and couldn't have spilled any\nsignificant information even if they had got him alive. The other item\nthey drew from his brain was a clear impression of the target of the\nraid--the professor's pal here.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Trigger said, lost in thought. She poked Repulsive lightly.\n\"That would be Fayle and his associates then. Or somebody who knew about\nthem. Did they want to kill it or grab it?\"\n\nThe Commissioner looked at her. \"Grab it, was the dead-brain report.\nWhy?\"\n\n\"Just wondering. Would make a difference, wouldn't it? Did they try\nagain?\"\n\n\"There've been five more attempts,\" he said.\n\n\"And what's everybody concluded from that?\"\n\n\"They want 113-A in a very bad way. So they need it.\"\n\n\"In connection with the key unit?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"That makes everything look very much better, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Quite a little,\" he said. \"The unit may not work, or may not work\nsatisfactorily, unless 113-A is in the area. Mantelish talks of\nsomething he calls proximity influence. Whatever that is, 113-A has\ndemonstrated it has it.\"\n\n\"So,\" Trigger said, \"they might have two thirds of what everybody wants,\nand you might have one third. Right here on the table. How many of the\nlater raiders did you catch?\"\n\n\"All of them,\" said the Commissioner. \"Around forty. We got them dead,\nwe got them alive. It didn't make much difference. They were hired\nhands. Very expensive hired hands, but still just that. Most of them\ndidn't know a thing we could use. The ones that did know something were\nmind-blocked again.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" Trigger said reflectively, \"you could _un_block someone\nlike that.\"\n\n\"You can, sometimes. If you're very good at it and if you have time\nenough. We couldn't afford to wait a year. They died before they could\ntell us anything.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then Trigger asked, \"How did you get involved in\nthis, personally?\"\n\n\"More or less by accident,\" the Commissioner said. \"It was in connection\nwith our second lead.\"\n\n\"That's me, huh?\" she said unhappily.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why would anyone want to grab me? I don't know anything.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"We haven't found out yet. We're hoping we will, in a\nvery few days.\"\n\n\"Is that one of the things you can't tell me about?\"\n\n\"I can tell you most of what I know at the moment,\" said the\nCommissioner. \"Remember the night we stopped off at Evalee on the way in\nfrom Manon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"That big hotel!\"\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\"About an hour after you'd decided to hit the bunk,\" Holati said, \"I\nportaled back to your rooms to pick up some Precol reports we'd been\nsetting up.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"I remember the reports.\"\n\n\"A couple of characters were working on your doors when I got there.\nThey went for their guns, unfortunately. But I called the nearest Scout\nIntelligence office and had them dead-brained.\"\n\n\"Why that?\" she asked.\n\n\"It could have been an accident--a couple of ordinary thugs. But their\nequipment looked a little too good for ordinary thugs. I didn't know\njust what to be suspicious of, but I got suspicious anyway.\"\n\n\"That's you, all right,\" Trigger acknowledged. \"What were they?\"\n\n\"They had an Evalee record which told us more than the brains did. They\nwere high-priced boys. Their brains told us they'd allowed themselves to\nbe mind-blocked on this particular job. High-priced boys won't do that\nunless they can set their standard price very much higher. It didn't\nlook at all any more as if they'd come to your door by accident.\"\n\n\"No,\" she admitted.\n\n\"The Feds got in on it then. There'd been that business in Mantelish's\nlab. There were similarities in the pattern. You knew Mantelish. You'd\nbeen on Harvest Moon with him. They thought there could be a\nconnection.\"\n\n\"But what connection?\" she protested. \"I _know_ I don't know anything\nthat could do anybody any good!\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I can't figure it either, Trigger girl. But the upshot of\nit was that I was put in charge of this phase of the general\ninvestigation. If there is a connection, it'll come out eventually. In\nany case, we want to know who's been trying to have you picked up and\nwhy.\"\n\nShe studied his face with troubled eyes.\n\n\"That's quite definite, is it?\" she asked. \"There couldn't possibly\nstill be a mistake?\"\n\n\"No. It's definite.\"\n\n\"So that's what the grabber business in the Colonial School yesterday\nwas about....\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It was their first try since the Evalee matter.\"\n\n\"Why do you think they waited so long?\"\n\n\"Because they suspected you were being guarded. It's difficult to keep\nan adequate number of men around without arousing doubts in interested\nobservers.\"\n\nTrigger glanced at the plasmoid. \"That sounds,\" she remarked, \"as if\nyou'd let other interested observers feel you'd left them a good opening\nto get at Repulsive.\"\n\nHe didn't quite smile. \"I might have done that. Don't tell the Council.\"\n\nTrigger pursed her lips. \"I won't. So the grabbers who were after me\nfigured I was booby-trapped. But then they came in anyway. That doesn't\nseem very bright. Or did you do something again to make them think the\nroad was clear?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"They were trying to clear the road for themselves. We\nthought they would finally. The deal was set up as a one-two.\"\n\n\"As a what?\"\n\n\"One-two. You slug into what could be a trap like that with one gang. If\nit was a trap, they were sacrifices. You hope the opposition will now\nrelax its precautions. Sometimes it does--and a day or so later you're\nback for the real raid. That works occasionally. Anyway it was the plan\nin this case.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"They'd started closing in for the grab in Ceyce when Quillan's group\nlocated you. So Quillan grabbed you first.\"\n\nShe flushed. \"I wasn't as smart as I thought, was I?\"\n\nThe Commissioner grunted. \"Smart enough to give us a king-sized\nheadache! But _they_ didn't have any trouble finding you. We discovered\ntonight that some kind of tracer material had been worked into all your\nclothes. Even the flimsies. Somebody may have been planted in the school\nlaundry, but that's not important now.\" He looked at her for a moment.\n\"What made you decide to take off so suddenly?\" he asked.\n\nTrigger shrugged. \"I was getting pretty angry with you,\" she admitted.\n\"More or less with everybody. Then I applied for a transfer, and the\napplication bounced--from Evalee! I figured I'd had enough and that I'd\njust quietly clear out. So I did--or thought I did.\"\n\n\"Can't blame you,\" said Holati.\n\nTrigger said, \"I still think it would have been smarter to keep me\ninformed right from the start of what was going on.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I wouldn't be telling you a thing even now,\" he\nsaid, \"if it hadn't been definitely established that you're already\ninvolved in the matter. This could develop into a pretty messy\noperation. I wouldn't have wanted you in on it, if it could have been\navoided. And if you weren't going to be in on it, I couldn't go spilling\nFederation secrets to you.\"\n\n\"I'm in on it, definitely, eh?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"For the duration.\"\n\n\"But you're still not telling me everything?\"\n\n\"There're a few things I can't tell you,\" he said. \"I'm following orders\nin that.\"\n\nTrigger smiled faintly. \"That's a switch! I didn't know you knew how.\"\n\n\"I've followed plenty of orders in my time,\" the Commissioner said,\n\"when I thought they made sense. And I think these do.\"\n\nTrigger was silent a moment. \"You said a while ago that most of the heat\nwas to go off me tonight. Can you talk about that?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's all right.\" He considered. \"I'll have to tell you something\nelse again first--why we're going to Manon.\"\n\nShe settled back in her chair. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Somebody got the idea that one of the things Gess Fayle might have done\nis to arrange things so he wouldn't have to come back to the Hub for a\nwhile. If he could set up shop on some outworld far enough away, and\ntinker around with that plasmoid unit for a year or so until he knew all\nabout it, he might do better for himself than by simply selling it to\nsomebody.\"\n\n\"But that would be pretty risky, wouldn't it?\" said Trigger. \"With just\nthe equipment he could pack on a League transport.\"\n\n\"Not very much risk,\" said the Commissioner, \"if he had an agreement to\nhave an Independent Fleet meet him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" She nodded.\n\n\"And by what is, at all events, an interesting coincidence,\" the\nCommissioner went on, \"we've had word that an outfit called Vishni's\nFleet hasn't been heard from for some months. Their I-Fleet area is a\nlong way out beyond Manon, but Fayle could have made it there, at League\nship speeds, in about twenty days. Less, if Vishni sent a few pilots to\nmeet him and guide him out of subspace. If he's bought Vishni's, he's\nhad his pick of a few hundred uncharted habitable planets and a few\nthousand very expert outworlders to see nothing happens to him\nplanetside. And Vishni's boys are exactly the kind of crumbs you could\nbuy for a deal like that.\n\n\"Now, what's been done is to hire a few of the other I-Fleets around\nthere and set them and as many Space Scout squadrons as could be kicked\nloose from duty elsewhere to surveying the Vishni territory. Our outfit\nis in charge of that operation. And Manon, of course, is a lot better\npoint from which to conduct it than the Hub. If something is discovered\nthat looks interesting enough to investigate in detail, we'll only be a\nweek's run away.\n\n\"So we've been ready to move for the past two weeks now, which was when\nthe first reports started coming in from the Vishni area--negative\nreports so far, by the way. I've kept stalling from day to day, because\nthere were also indications that your grabber friends might be getting\nset to swing at you finally. It seemed tidier to get that matter cleared\nup first. Now they've swung, and we'll go.\"\n\nHe rubbed his chin. \"The nice thing about it all,\" he remarked, \"is that\nwe're going there with the two items the opposition has revealed it\nwants. We're letting them know those items will be available in the\nManon System henceforward. They might get discouraged and just drop the\nwhole project. If they do, that's fine. We'll go ahead with cleaning up\nthe Vishni phase of the operation.\n\n\"But,\" he continued, \"the indications are they can't drop their project\nany more than we can drop looking for that key unit. So we'll expect\nthem to show up in Manon. When they do, they'll be working in unfamiliar\nterritory and in a system where they have only something like fifty\nthousand people to hide out in, instead of a planetary civilization. I\nthink they'll find things getting very hot for them very fast in Manon.\"\n\n\"_Very_ good,\" said Trigger. \"That I like! But what makes you think the\nopposition is just one group? There might be a bunch of them by now.\nMaybe even fighting among themselves.\"\n\n\"I'd bet on at least two groups myself,\" he said. \"And if they're\nfighting, they've got our blessing. They're still all opposition as far\nas we're concerned.\"\n\nShe nodded, \"How are you letting them know about the move?\"\n\n\"The mountains around here are lousy with observers. Very cute tricks\nsome of them use--one boy has been sitting in a hollow tree for weeks.\nWe let them see what we want to. This evening they saw you coming in.\nLater tonight they'll see you climbing into the ship with the rest of\nthe party and taking off. They've already picked up messages to tell\nthem just where the ship's going.\" He paused. \"But you've got a job to\nfinish up here first, Trigger. That'll take about four days. So it won't\nreally be you they see climbing into the ship.\"\n\n\"What!\" She straightened up.\n\n\"We've got a facsimile for you,\" he explained. \"Girl agent. She goes\nalong to draw the heat to Manon.\"\n\nTrigger felt herself tightening up slowly all over.\n\n\"What's this job you're talking about?\" she asked evenly.\n\n\"Can't tell you in too much detail. But around four days from now\nsomebody is coming in to Maccadon to interview you.\"\n\n\"Interview me? What about?\"\n\nHe hesitated a moment. \"There's a theory,\" he said, \"that you might have\ninformation you don't know you have. And that the people who sent\ngrabbers after you want that information. If it's true, the interview\nwill bring it out.\"\n\nHer mouth went dry suddenly. She turned her head to Quillan. \"Major,\"\nshe said, \"I think I'd like that cigarette now.\"\n\nHe came over and lit one for her. Trigger thanked him and puffed. And\nshe'd almost spilled everything, she was thinking. The paid-up\nreservation. Every last thing.\n\n\"I'd like to get it straight,\" she said. \"What you're talking about\nsounds like it's a mind-search job, Holati.\"\n\n\"It's in that class,\" he said. \"But it won't be an ordinary mind-search.\nThe people who are coming here are top experts at that kind of work.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I don't know much about it.... Do they think somebody's got\nto me with a hypno-spray or something? That I've been conditioned?\nSomething like that?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Trigger,\" he said. \"It may be something in that line.\nBut whatever it is, they'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nTrigger moistened her lips, \"I was thinking, you know,\" she said.\n\"Supposing I'm mind-blocked.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I can tell you that, anyway,\" he said. \"We already\nknow you're not.\"\n\nTrigger was silent a moment. Then she said, \"After that interview's\nover, I'm to ship out to Manon--is that it?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"But it would depend on the outcome of that interview too, wouldn't it?\"\nTrigger pointed out. \"I mean you can't really be sure what those people\nmight decide, can you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" he said. \"This thing's been all scheduled out, Trigger.\nAnd the next step of the schedule for you is Manon. Nothing else.\"\n\nShe didn't believe him in the least. He couldn't know. She nodded.\n\n\"Guess I might as well play along.\" She looked at him. \"I don't think I\nreally had much choice, did I?\"\n\n\"Afraid not,\" he admitted. \"It's one of those things that just have to\nbe done. But you won't find it all bad. Your companion, by the way, for\nthe next three days will be Mihul.\"\n\n\"Mihul!\" Trigger exclaimed.\n\n\"Right there,\" said Mihul's voice. Trigger swung around in her chair.\nMihul stood in a door which had appeared in the full wall of the room.\nShe gave Trigger a smile. Trigger looked back at the Commissioner.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, Mihul's in Scout Intelligence,\" he said, \"wouldn't be here if she\nweren't.\"\n\n\"Been an agent for eighteen years,\" Mihul said, coming forward. \"Hi,\nTrigger, surprised?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Trigger admitted. \"Very.\"\n\n\"They brought me into this job,\" Mihul said, \"because they figured you\nand I would get along together just fine.\"\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nIt was really infernally bad luck! Mihul was going to be the least easy\nof wardens to get away from ... particularly in time to catch a liner\ntomorrow night. Mihul knew her much too well.\n\n\"Like to come along and meet your facsimile now?\" Mihul inquired. She\ngrinned. \"Most people find the first time quite an experience.\"\n\nTrigger stood up resignedly. \"All right,\" she said. They were being\npolite about it, but it was clear that it was still a cop and prisoner\nsituation. And old friend Mihul! She remembered something then. \"I\nbelieve Major Quillan has my gun.\"\n\nHe looked at her thoughtfully, not smiling. \"No,\" he said. \"Gave it to\nMihul.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Mihul. \"Let's go, kid.\"\n\nThey went out through the door that had appeared in the wall. It closed\nagain behind them.\n\nThe facsimile stood up from behind a table at which she had been\nsitting as Trigger and Mihul came into the room. She gave Trigger a\nbrief, impersonal glance, then looked at Mihul.\n\nMihul performed no introductions.\n\n\"Dress, robe and scarf,\" she said to the facsimile. \"The shoes are close\nenough.\" She turned to Trigger. \"She'll be wearing your street clothes\nwhen she leaves,\" she said. \"Could we have the dress now?\"\n\nTrigger pulled the dress over her head, tossed it to Mihul and stood in\nher underwear, looking at her double slip out of her street clothes.\nThey did seem to be a very close match in size and proportions. Watching\nthe shifting play of slim muscles in the long legs and smooth back,\nTrigger decided the similarity was largely a natural one. The\nsilver-blonde hair was the same, of course. The gray eyes seemed almost\nidentical--and the rest of the face was a little _too_ identical! They\nmust have used a life-mask there.\n\nIt was a bit uncanny. Like seeing one's mirror image start moving about\nindependently. If the girl had talked, it might have reduced the effect.\nBut she remained silent.\n\nShe put on the dress Trigger had been wearing and smoothed it down.\nMihul surveyed the result. She nodded. \"Perfect.\" She took Trigger's\nrobe and scarf from the back of a chair where someone had draped them\nand handed them over.\n\n\"You won't wear the scarf,\" she said. \"Just shove it into a pocket of\nthe coat.\"\n\nThe girl slung the cloak over her shoulder and stood holding the scarf.\nMihul looked her over once more. \"You'll do,\" she said. She smiled\nbriefly. \"All right.\"\n\nThe facsimile glanced at Trigger again, turned and moved attractively\nout of the room. Trigger frowned.\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Mihul asked. She had gone over to a wall basin and\nwas washing out a tumbler.\n\n\"Why does she walk like that?\"\n\n\"The little swing in the rear? She's studied it.\" Mihul half filled the\ntumbler with water, fished a transparent splinter of something out of a\npocket and cracked the splinter over the edge of the glass. \"Among your\nfriends it's referred to as the Argee Lilt. She's got you down pat,\nkid.\"\n\nTrigger didn't comment. \"Am I supposed to put on her clothes?\"\n\n\"No. We've got another costume for you.\" Mihul came over, holding out\nthe glass. \"This is for you.\"\n\nTrigger looked at the glass suspiciously. \"What's in it?\"\n\nThe blue eyes regarded her mildly. \"You could call it a sedative.\"\n\n\"Don't need any. Thanks.\"\n\n\"Better take it anyway.\" Mihul patted her hip with her other hand.\n\"Little hypo gun here. That's the alternative.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"That's right. Same type of charge as in your fancy Denton. Stuff in the\nglass is easier to take and won't leave you groggy.\"\n\n\"What's the idea?\"\n\n\"I've known you quite a while,\" said Mihul. \"And I was watching you the\nlast twenty minutes in that room through a screen. You'll take off again\nif you get the least chance. I don't blame you a bit. You're being\npushed around. But now it's my job to see you don't take off; and until\nwe get to where you're going, I want to be sure you'll stay quiet.\"\n\nShe still held out the glass, in a long, tanned, capable hand. She stood\nthree inches taller than Trigger, weighted thirty-five pounds more. Not\nan ounce of that additional thirty-five pounds was fat. If she'd needed\nassistance, the hunting lodge was full of potential helpers. She didn't.\n\n\"I never claimed I liked this arrangement,\" Trigger said carefully. \"I\ndid say I'd go along with it. I will. Isn't that enough?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Mihul said promptly. \"Give word of parole?\"\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n\"No!\" Trigger said.\n\n\"I thought not. Drink or gun?\"\n\n\"Drink,\" Trigger said coldly. She took the glass. \"How long will it put\nme out?\"\n\n\"Eight to nine hours.\" Mihul stood by watchfully while Trigger emptied\nthe tumbler. After a moment the tumbler fell to the floor. She reached\nout and caught Trigger as she started down.\n\n\"All right,\" she said across her shoulder to the open doorway behind\nher. \"Let's move!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTrigger awoke and instantly went taut with tension. She lay quiet a few\nseconds, not even opening her eyes. There was cool sunlight on her\neyelids, but she was indoors. There was a subdued murmur of sound\nsomewhere; after a moment she knew it came from a news viewer turned\nlow, in some adjoining room. But there didn't seem to be anybody\nimmediately around her. Warily she opened her eyes.\n\nShe was on a couch in an airy, spacious room furnished in the palest of\ngreens and ivory. One entire side of the room was either a window or a\nsolido screen. In it was a distant mountain range with many snowy peaks,\nan almost cloudless blue sky. Sun at midmorning or midafternoon.\n\nSun and all had the look of Maccadon--they probably still were on the\nplanet. That was where the interview was to take place. But she also\ncould have been sent on a three-day space cruise, which would be a\nrather good way to make sure a prisoner stayed exactly where you wanted\nher. This could be a spaceliner suite with a packaged view of any one of\nsome hundreds of worlds, and with packaged sunlight thrown in.\n\nThere was one door to the room. It stood open, and the news viewer talk\ncame from there.\n\nTrigger sat up quietly and looked down at the clothes she wore. All\nwhite. A short-sleeved half-blouse of some soft, rather heavy, very\ncomfortable unfamiliar stuff. Bare midriff. White kid trousers which\nflared at the thighs and were drawn in to a close fit just above the\nknees and down the calves, vanishing into kid boots with thick, flexible\nsoles.\n\nSporting outfit.... That meant Maccadon!\n\nShe pulled a handful of hair forward and looked at it. They'd recolored\nit--this time to a warm mahogany brown. She swung her legs off the couch\nand stood up quietly. A dozen soft steps across the springy thick-napped\nturf of ivory carpet took her to the window.\n\nThe news viewer clicked and went silent.\n\n\"Not bad,\" Trigger said. She saw a long range of woodlands and open\nheath, rising gradually into the flanks of the mountains. On the far\nright was the still, silver glitter of two lakes. \"Where are we?\"\n\n\"Byla Uplands Game Preserve. That's the game bird area before you.\"\nMihul appeared in the doorframe, in an outfit almost a duplicate of\nTrigger's, in pearl-gray tones. \"Feel all right?\"\n\n\"Feeling fine,\" Trigger said. Byla Uplands--the southern tip of the\ncontinent. She could make it back to Ceyce in two hours or less! She\nturned and grinned at Mihul. \"I also feel hungry. How long was I out?\"\n\nMihul glanced at her wrist watch. \"Eight hours, ten minutes. You woke up\non schedule. I had breakfast sent up thirty minutes ago. I've already\neaten mine--took one sniff and plunged in. It's good!\" Mihul's hair,\nTrigger saw, had been cropped short and a streak of gray added over the\nright side; and they'd changed the color of her eyes to hazel. She\nwondered what had been done to her along that line. \"Want to come in?\"\nMihul said. \"We can talk while you eat.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"After I've freshened up.\"\n\nThe bathroom mirror showed they'd left her eyes alone. But there was a\nvery puzzling impression that she was staring at an image considerably\nplumper, shorter, younger than it should be--a teen-ager around\nseventeen or eighteen. Her eyes narrowed. If they'd done flesh-sculpting\non her, it could cause complications.\n\nShe stripped hurriedly and checked. They hadn't tampered with her body.\nSo it had to be the clothes; though it was difficult to see how even the\nmost cunning cut could provide such a very convincing illusion of being\nmore rounded out, heavier around the thighs, larger breasts--just\nmissing being dumpy, in fact. She dressed again, looked again, and came\nout of the bathroom, still puzzled.\n\n\"Choice of three game birds for breakfast.\" Mihul announced. \"Never\nheard of any of them. All good. Plus regular stuff.\" She patted her flat\nmidriff. \"Ate too much!\" she admitted. \"Now dig in and I'll brief you.\"\n\nTrigger dug in. \"I had a look at myself in the mirror,\" she remarked.\n\"What's this now-you-see-it-now-you-don't business of fifteen or so\npounds of baby fat?\"\n\nMihul laughed. \"You don't really have it.\"\n\n\"I know that too. How do they do it?\"\n\n\"Subcolor job in the clothes. They're not really white. Anyone looking\nat you gets his vision distorted a little without realizing it. Takes a\nwider view of certain areas, for example. You can play it around in a\nlot of ways.\"\n\n\"I never heard of that one,\" Trigger said. \"You'd think it would be\nsensational in fashions.\"\n\n\"It would be. Right now it's top secret for as long as Intelligence can\nkeep it that way.\"\n\nTrigger chewed a savory morsel of something. \"Then why did you tell me?\"\n\n\"You're one of the gang, however reluctant. And you're good at keeping\nthe mouth shut. Your name, by the way, is now Comteen Lod, just turned\neighteen. I am your dear mama. You call me Drura. We're from\nSlyth-Talgon on Evalee, here for a few days shooting.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Do we do any shooting?\"\n\nMihul pointed a finger at a side table. The Denton lay there, looking\nlike a toy beside a standard slender-barrelled sporting pistol. \"Bet\nyour life, Comteen!\" she said. \"I've always been too stingy to try out a\nfirst-class preserve on my own money. And this one is _first_ class.\"\nShe paused. \"Comteen and Drura Lod really exist. We're a very fair copy\nof what they look like, and they'll be kept out of sight till we're done\nhere. Now--\"\n\nShe leaned back comfortably, tilting the chair and clasping her hands\naround one knee. \"Aside from the sport, we're here because you're a\nconvalescent. You're recovering from a rather severe attack of Dykart\nFever. Heard of it?\"\n\nTrigger reflected. \"Something you pick up in some sections of the Evalee\ntropics, isn't it?\"\n\nMihul nodded. \"That's what you did, child! Skipped your shots on the\nlast trip we took--and six months later you're still paying for it. You\nwere in one of those typical Dykart fever comas when we brought you in\nlast night.\"\n\n\"Very clever!\" Trigger commented acidly.\n\n\"Very.\" Mihul pursed her lips. \"The Dykart bug causes temporary\nderangements, you know--spells during which convalescents talk wildly,\nimagine things.\"\n\nTrigger popped another fragment of meat between her teeth and chewed\nthoughtfully, looking over at Mihul. \"Very good duck or whatever!\" she\nsaid. \"Like imagining they've been more or less kidnapped, you mean?\"\n\n\"Things like that,\" Mihul agreed.\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"I wouldn't anyway. You types are bound to have\nall the legal angles covered.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Mihul. \"Just thought I'd mention it. Have you used the\nDenton much on game?\"\n\n\"Not too often.\" Trigger had been wondering whether they'd left the\nstunner compartment loaded. \"But it's a very fair gun for it.\"\n\n\"I know. The other one's a Yool. Good game gun, too. You'll use that.\"\n\nTrigger swallowed. She met the calm eyes watching her. \"I've never\nhandled a Yool. Why the switch?\"\n\n\"They're easy to handle. The reason for the switch is that you can't\njust stun someone with a Yool. It's better if we both stay armed, though\nit isn't really necessary--so much money comes to play around here they\ncan afford to keep the Uplands very thoroughly policed, and they do. But\nan ace in the hole never hurts.\" She considered. \"Changed your mind\nabout that parole business yet?\"\n\n\"I hadn't really thought about it,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"I'd let you carry your own gun then.\"\n\nTrigger looked reflective, then shook her head. \"I'd rather not.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Mihul said agreeably. \"In that case though, there\nshould be something else understood.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"We'll have up to three-four days to spend here together before Whatzzit\nshows up.\"\n\n\"Whatzzit?\"\n\n\"For future reference,\" Mihul said, \"Whatzzit will be that which--or he\nor she who--wishes to have that interview with you and has arranged for\nit. That's in case you want to talk about it. I might as well tell you\nthat I'll do very little talking about Whatzzit.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" Trigger suggested, \"I was one of the gang.\"\n\n\"I've got special instructions on the matter,\" Mihul said. \"Anyway,\nWhatzzit shows up. You have your interview. After that we do whatever\nWhatzzit says we're to do. As you know.\"\n\nTrigger nodded.\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" said Mihul, \"we're here. Very pleasant place to spend\nthree-four days in my opinion, and I think, in yours.\"\n\n\"Very pleasant,\" Trigger agreed. \"I've been suspecting it was you who\nsuggested it would be a good place to wait in.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mihul said. \"Though I might have, if anyone had asked me. But\nWhatzzit's handling all the arrangements, it seems. Now we could have\nfun here--which, I suspect, would be the purpose as far as you're\nconcerned.\"\n\n\"Fun?\" Trigger said.\n\n\"To put you into a good frame of mind for that interview, might be the\nidea,\" Mihul said. \"I don't know. Three days here should relax almost\nanyone. Get in a little shooting. Loaf around the pools. Go for rides.\nThings like that. The only trouble is I'm afraid you're nourishing dark\nnotions which are likely to take all the enjoyment out of it. Not to\nmention the possibility of really relaxing.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Oh,\" Mihul said, \"there're all sorts of possibilities, of course.\" She\nnodded her head at the guns. \"Like yanking the Denton out of my holster\nand feeding me a dose of the stunner. Or picking up that coffee pot\nthere and tapping me on the skull with it. It's about the right weight.\"\n\nTrigger said thoughtfully, \"I don't think either of those would work.\"\n\n\"They might,\" Mihul said. \"They just might! You're fast. You've been\ntaught to improvise. And there's something eating you. You're edgy as a\ncat.\"\n\n\"So?\" Trigger said.\n\n\"So,\" Mihul said, \"there are a number of alternatives. I'll lay them out\nfor you. You take your pick. For one, I could just keep you doped. Three\ndays in dope won't hurt you, and you'll certainly be no problem then.\nAnother way--I'll let you stay awake, but we stay in our rooms. I can\nlock you in at night, and that window is escape-proof. I checked. It\nwould be sort of boring, but we can have tapes and stuff brought up. I'd\nhave the guns put away and I'd watch you like a hawk every minute of the\nday.\"\n\nShe looked at Trigger inquiringly. \"Like either of those?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"They're safe,\" Mihul said. \"Quite safe. Maybe I should.... Well, the\nheat's off, and it's just a matter now of holding you for Whatzzit.\nThere're a couple of other choices. One of them has an angle you won't\nlike much either. On the other hand, it would give you a sporting chance\nto take off if you're really wild about it. And it's entirely in line\nwith my instructions. I warned them you're tricky.\"\n\nTrigger stopped eating. \"Let's hear that one.\"\n\nMihul tilted the chair back a little farther and studied her a moment.\n\"Pretty much like I said before. Everything friendly and casual. Gun a\nbit, swim a bit. Go for a ride or soar. Lie around in the sun. But\nbecause of those notions of yours, there'd be one thing added. An\nun-incentive.\"\n\n\"An un-incentive?\" Trigger repeated.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Mihul. \"_That_ isn't at all in line with my\ninstructions. But you're a pretty dignified little character, and I\nthink it should work.\"\n\n\"Just what does this un-incentive consist of?\" Trigger inquired warily.\n\n\"If you make a break and get away,\" Mihul said, \"that's one thing.\nSomething's eating you, and I'm not sure I like the way this matter's\nbeen handled. In fact, I don't like it. So I'll try to stop you from\nleaving, but if it turns out I couldn't, I won't hold any grudges. Even\nif I wake up with lumps.\"\n\nShe paused. \"On the other hand,\" she said, \"there we are--together for\nthree-four days. I don't want to spend them fighting off attempts to\nclobber me every thirty seconds. So any time you try and miss, Comteen,\nmama is going to pin you down fast, and hot up your seat with whatever\nis handiest.\"\n\nTrigger stared at her.\n\nShe cleared her throat.\n\n\"While I'm carrying a gun?\" she said shakily. \"Don't be ridiculous,\nMihul!\"\n\n\"You're not going to gun me for keeps to get out of a licking,\" Mihul\nsaid. \"And that's all the Yool can do. How else will you stop me?\"\n\nTrigger's fingernails drummed the table top briefly. She wet her lips.\n\"I don't know,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mihul, \"all this unpleasantness can be avoided very\neasily. There's always the fourth method.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Just give parole.\"\n\n\"No parole,\" Trigger said thinly.\n\n\"All right. Which of the other ways will it be?\"\n\nTrigger didn't hesitate. \"The sporting chance,\" she said. \"The others\naren't choices.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" said Mihul. She stood up and went over to the wall. She\nselected a holster belt from the pair hanging there and fastened it\naround her. \"I rather thought you'd pick it,\" she said. She gave Trigger\na brief grin. \"Just make sure it's a good opening!\"\n\n\"I will,\" Trigger said.\n\nMihul moved to the side table, took up the Denton, looked at it, and\nslid it into her holster. She turned to gaze out the window. \"Nice\ncountry!\" she said. \"If you're done with breakfast, how about going out\nright now for a first try at the birds?\"\n\nTrigger hefted the coffee pot gently. It was about the right weight at\nthat. But the range was a little more than she liked, considering the\nun-incentive.\n\nBesides, it might crack the monster's skull.\n\nShe set the pot gently down again.\n\n\"Great idea!\" she said. \"And I'm all finished eating.\"\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nHalf an hour later there still hadn't been any decent openings. Trigger\nwas maintaining a somewhat brooding silence at the moment. Mihul, beside\nher, in the driver's seat of the tiny sports hopper, chatted pleasantly\nabout this and that. But she didn't appear to expect any answers.\n\nThere weren't many half-hours left to be wasted.\n\nTrigger stared thoughtfully out through the telescopic ground-view plate\nbefore her, while the hopper soared at a thousand feet toward the\ntwo-mile square of preserve area which had been assigned to them to hunt\nover that morning. Dimly reflected in the view plate, she could see the\nhead of the gun-pup who went with that particular area lifted above the\nseat-back behind her. He was gazing straight ahead between the two\nhumans, absorbed in canine reflections.\n\nThere was plenty of bird life down there. Some were original Terran\nforms, maintained unchanged in the U-League's genetic banks. Probably\nmany more were inspired modifications produced on Grand Commerce game\nranches. At any other time, Trigger would have found herself enjoying\nthe outing almost as much as Mihul.\n\nNot now. Other things kept running through her head. Money, for example.\nThey hadn't returned her own cash to her and apparently didn't intend\nto--at least not until after the interview. But Mihul was carrying at\nleast part of their spending money in a hip pocket wallet. The rest of\nit might be in a concealed room safe or deposited with the resort\nhotel's cashier.\n\nShe glanced over at Mihul again. Good friend Mihul never before had\nlooked quite so large, lithe, alert and generally fit for a\nrough-and-tumble. That un-incentive idea was fiendishly ingenious! It\nwas difficult to plan things through clearly and calmly while one's\nself-esteem kept quailing at vivid visualizations of the results of\nmaking a mistake.\n\nThe hopper settled down near the center of their territory, guided the\nlast half mile by Mihul who had fancied the looks of some\nshrub-cluttered ravines ahead. Trigger opened the door on her side. The\ngun-pup leaped lightly across the seat and came out behind her. He\nturned to look over his huntresses and gave them a wag, a polite but\nperfunctory one. Then he stood waiting for orders.\n\nMihul considered him. \"Guess he's in charge here,\" she said. She waved\na hand at the pup. \"Go find 'em, old boy! We'll string along.\"\n\nHe loped off swiftly, a lean brown houndlike creature, a Grand Commerce\ndevelopment of some aristocratic Terran breed and probably a\nconsiderable improvement on the best of his progenitors. He curved\naround a thick clump of shrubs like a low-flying hawk. Two plump\nfeather-shapes, emerald-green and crimson, whirred up out of the near\nside of the shrubbery, saw the humans before them and rose steeply,\npicking up speed.\n\nA great many separate, clearly detailed things seemed to be going on\nwithin the next four or five seconds. Mihul swore, scooping the Denton\nout of its holster. Trigger already had the Yool out, but the gun was\nunfamiliar; she hesitated. Fascinated, she glanced from the speeding,\nsoaring feather-balls to Mihul, watched the tall woman straighten for an\noverhead shot, left hand grasping right wrist to steady the lightweight\nDenton--and in that particular instant Trigger knew exactly what was\ngoing to happen next.\n\nThe Denton flicked forth one bolt. Mihul stretched a little more for the\nnext shot. Trigger wheeled matter-of-factly, dropping the Yool, left\nelbow close in to her side. Her left fist rammed solidly into Mihul's\nbare brown midriff, just under the arch of the rib cage.\n\nThat punch, in those precise circumstances, would have paralyzed the\naverage person. It didn't quite paralyze Mihul. She dropped forward,\ndoubled up and struggling for breath, but already twisting around\ntoward Trigger. Trigger stepped across her, picked up the Denton,\nshifted its setting, thumbed it to twelve-hour stunner max, and let\nMihul have it between the shoulder blades.\n\nMihul jerked forward and went limp.\n\nTrigger stood there, shaking violently, looking down at Mihul and\nfighting the irrational conviction that she had just committed\ncold-blooded murder.\n\nThe gun-pup trotted up with the one downed bird. He placed it reverently\nby Mihul's outflung hand. Then he sat back on his haunches and regarded\nTrigger with something of the detached compassion of a good undertaker.\n\nApparently this wasn't his first experience with a hunting casualty.\n\nThe story Trigger babbled into the hopper's communicator a minute later\nwas that Drura Lod had succumbed to an attack of Dykart fever coma--and\nthat an ambulance and a fast flit to a hospital in the nearest city were\nindicated.\n\nThe preserve hotel was startled but reassuring. That the mother should\nbe afflicted with the same ailment as the daughter was news to them but\nplausible enough. Within eight minutes, a police ambulance was flying\nMihul and Trigger at emergency speeds towards a small Uplands City\nbehind the mountains.\n\nTrigger never found out the city's name. Three minutes after she'd\nfollowed Mihul's floating stretcher into the hospital, she quietly left\nthe building again by a street entrance. Mihul's wallet had contained\ntwo hundred and thirteen crowns. It was enough, barely.\n\nShe got a complete change of clothes in the first Automatic Service\nstore she came to and left the store in them, carrying the sporting\noutfit in a bag. The aircab she hired to take her to Ceyce had to be\npaid for in advance, which left her eighty-two crowns. As they went\nflying over a lake a while later, the bag with the sporting clothes and\naccessories was dumped out of the cab's rear window. It was just\npossible that the Space Scouts had been able to put that tracer material\nidea to immediate use.\n\nIn Ceyce a short two hours after she'd felled Mihul, Trigger called the\ninterstellar spaceport and learned that the Dawn City was open to\npassengers and their guests.\n\nBirna Drellgannoth picked up her tickets and went on board, mingling\nunostentatiously with a group in a mood of festive leave-taking. She\nwent fading even more unostentatiously down a hallway when the group\nstopped cheerfully to pose for a solidopic girl from one of the news\nagencies. She located her cabin after a lengthy search, set the door to\ndon't-disturb, glanced around the cabin and decided to inspect it in\nmore detail later.\n\nShe pulled off her slippers, climbed on the outsized divan which passed\nhere for a bunk, and stretched out.\n\nShe lay there a while, blinking at the ceiling and worrying a little\nabout Mihul. Even theoretically a stunner-max blast couldn't cause Mihul\nthe slightest permanent damage. It might, however, leave her in a\nfairly peevish mood after the grogginess wore off, since the impact\nwasn't supposed to be pleasant. But Mihul had stated she would hold no\ngrudges over a successful escape attempt; and even if they caught up\nwith her again before she got to Manon, this attempt certainly had to be\nrated a technical success.\n\nThey might catch up, of course, Trigger thought. The Federation must\nhave an enormous variety of means at its disposal when it set out\nseriously to locate one of its missing citizens. But the Dawn City would\nbe some hours on its way before Mihul even began to think coherently\nagain. She'd spread the alarm then, but it should be a while before they\nstarted to suspect Trigger had left the planet. Maccadon was her home\nworld, after all. If she'd just wanted to hole up, that was where she\nwould have had the best chance to do it successfully.\n\nEvalee, the first Hub stop, was only nine hours' flight away; Garth lay\nless than five hours beyond Evalee. After that there was only the long\nsubspace run to Manon....\n\nThey'd have to work very fast to keep her from leaving the Hub this\ntime!\n\nTrigger glanced over at the Denton lying by the bedside ComWeb on a\nlittle table at the head of the divan-thing. She was aware of a feeling\nof great contentment, of growing relaxation. She closed her eyes.\n\nBy and large, she thought--all things considered--she hadn't come off\nbadly among the cloak and dagger experts! She was on her way to Manon.\n\nSome hours later she slept through the Dawn City's thunderous takeoff.\n\nWhen she woke up next she was in semidarkness. But she knew where she\nwas and a familiar feeling of low-weight told her the ship was in\nflight. She sat up.\n\nAt her motion, the area about her brightened, and the cabin grew visible\nagain. It was rather large, oval-shaped. There were three closed doors\nin the walls, and the walls themselves were light amber, of oddly\ninsubstantial appearance. A rosy tinge was flowing up from the floor\nlevel through them, and as the color surged higher and deepened, there\ncame an accompanying stir of far-off, barely audible music. The\ndon't-disturb sign still reflected dimly from the interior panels of the\npassage door. Trigger found its control switch on the bedstand and shut\nit off.\n\nAt once a soft chiming sounded from the miniature ComWeb on the\nbedstand. Its screen filled with a pulsing glow, and there was a voice.\n\n\"This is a recording, Miss Drellgannoth,\" the voice told her. \"If Room\nService may intrude with an audio message, please be so good as to touch\nthe blue circle at the base of your ComWeb.\"\n\nTrigger touched the blue circle. \"Go ahead,\" she invited.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Drellgannoth,\" said the voice. \"For the duration of the\nvoyage your personal ComWeb will be opened to callers, for either audio\nor visual intrusion, only by your verbal permission or by your touch on\nthe blue circle.\"\n\nIt stopped. Another voice picked up. \"This is your Personal Room\nStewardess, Miss Drellgannoth. Forgive the intrusion, but the ship will\ndive in one hour. Do you wish to have a rest cubicle prepared?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Trigger said. \"I'll stay awake.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Drellgannoth. As a formality and in accordance with\nFederation regulations, allow me to remind you that Federation Law does\nnot permit the bearing of personal weapons by passengers during a dive.\"\n\nHer glance went to the Denton. \"All right,\" she said. \"I won't. It's\nbecause of dive hallucinations, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Miss Drellgannoth. Yes, it is because of the\nmisapprehensions which may be caused by dive hallucinations. May I be of\nservice to you at this time? Perhaps you would like me to demonstrate\nthe various interesting uses of your personal ComWeb Cabinet?\"\n\nTrigger's eyes shifted to the far end of the cabin. A rather large, very\nelegant piece of furniture stood there. Its function hadn't been\nimmediately obvious, but she had heard of ComWeb Service Cabinets.\n\nShe thanked the stewardess but declined the offer. The lady switched\noff, apparently a trifle distressed at not having discovered anything\nBirna Drellgannoth's personal stewardess might do for Birna right now.\n\nTrigger went curiously over to the cabinet. It opened at her touch and\nshe sat down before it, glancing over its panels. A remarkable number\nof uses were indicated, which might make it confusing to the average Hub\ncitizen. But she had been trained in communications, and the service\ncabinet was as simple as any gadget in its class could get.\n\nShe punched in the ship's location diagram. The Dawn City was slightly\nmore than an hour out of Ceyce Port, but it hadn't yet cleared the\nsubspace nets which created interlocking and impenetrable fields of\nenergy about the Maccadon System. A ship couldn't dive in such an area\nwithout risking immediate destruction; but the nets were painstakingly\nmaintained insurance against a day when subspace warfare might again\nexplode through the Hub.\n\nTrigger glanced over the diagrammed route ahead. Evalee.... Garth. A\ntiny green spark in the far remoteness of space beyond them represented\nManon's sun.\n\nEleven days or so. With the money to afford a rest cubicle, the time\ncould be cut to a subjective three or four hours.\n\nBut it would have been foolish anyway to sleep through the one trip on a\nHub luxury liner she was ever likely to take in her life.\n\nShe set the cabinet to a review of the Dawn City's passenger facilities,\nand was informed that everything would remain at the disposal of waking\npassengers throughout all dives. She glanced over bars, fashion shows,\ndining and gaming rooms. The Cascade Plunge, from the looks of it, would\nhave been something for Mihul.... \"Our Large Staff of Traveler's\nCompanions\"--just what she needed. The Solido Auditorium \"... and the\nInferno--our Sensations Unlimited Hall.\" A dulcet voice informed her\nregretfully that Federation Law did not permit the transmission of full\nSU effects to individual cabins. It did, however, permit a few sample\nglimpses. Trigger took her glimpses, sniffed austerely, switched back to\nthe fashions.\n\nThere had been a neat little black suit on display there. While she\ndidn't intend to start roaming about the ship until it dived and the\nmajority of her fellow travelers were immersed in their rest cubicles,\nshe probably still would be somewhat conspicuous in her Automatic Sales\ndress on a boat like the Dawn City. That little black suit hadn't looked\nat all expensive--\n\n\"Twelve hundred forty-two Federation credits?\" she repeated evenly a\nminute later. \"I see!\"\n\nCame to roughly eight hundred fifty Maccadon crowns, was what she saw.\n\n\"May we model it in your suite, madam?\" the store manager inquired.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Trigger told her. \"Just looking them over a bit.\" She\nswitched off, frowned absently at a panel labeled \"Your Selection of\nPersonalized Illusion Arrangements,\" shook her head, snapped the cabinet\nshut and stood up. It looked like she had a choice between being\nconspicuous and staying in her cabin and playing around with things like\nthe creation of illusion scenes.\n\nAnd she was really a little old for that kind of entertainment.\n\nShe opened the door to the narrow passageway outside the cabin and\nglanced tentatively along it. It was very quiet here. One of the reasons\nthis was the cheapest cabin they'd had available presumably was that it\nlay outside the main passenger areas. To the right the corridor opened\non a larger hall which ran past a few hundred yards of storerooms before\nit came to a stairway. At the head of the stairway, one came out\neventually on one of the passenger levels. To the left the corridor\nended at the door of what seemed to be the only other cabin in this\nsection.\n\nTrigger looked back toward the other cabin.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"Well ... hello.\"\n\nThe other cabin door stood open. A rather odd-looking little person sat\nin a low armchair immediately inside it. She had lifted a thin,\ngreen-sleeved arm in a greeting or beckoning gesture as Trigger turned.\n\nShe repeated the gesture now. \"Come here, girl!\" she called amiably in a\nquavery old-woman voice.\n\nWell, it couldn't do any harm. Trigger put on her polite smile and\nwalked down the hall toward the open door. A quite tiny old woman it\nwas, with a head either shaved or naturally bald, dressed in a kind of\ndark-green pajamas. Long glassy earrings of the same color pulled down\nthe lobes of her small ears. The oddness of the face was due mainly to\nthe fact that she wore a great deal of make-up, and that the make-up was\na matching green.\n\nShe twisted her head to the left as Trigger came up, and chirped\nsomething. Another woman appeared behind the door, almost a duplicate of\nthe first, except that this one had gone all out for pink. Tiny things.\nThey both beamed up at her.\n\nTrigger beamed back. She stopped just outside the door.\n\n\"Greetings,\" said the pink one.\n\n\"Greetings,\" Trigger replied, wondering what world they came from. The\nstyle wasn't exactly like anything she'd seen before.\n\n\"We,\" the green lady informed her with a not unkindly touch of\ncondescension, \"are with the Askab of Elfkund.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Trigger in the tone of one who is impressed. Elfkund hadn't\nrung any bells.\n\n\"And with whom are you, girl?\" the pink one inquired.\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said, \"I'm not actually _with_ anybody.\"\n\nThe smiles faded abruptly. They glanced at each other, then looked back\nat Trigger. Rather severely, it seemed.\n\n\"Did you mean,\" the green one asked carefully, \"that you are _not_ a\nretainer?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"I'm from Maccadon,\" she explained. \"The name is Birna\nDrellgannoth.\"\n\n\"Maccadon,\" the pink one repeated. \"You are a commoner then, young\nBirna?\"\n\n\"Of course she is!\" The green one looked offended. \"Maccadon!\" She got\nout of her chair with remarkable spryness and moved to the door. \"It's\nquite drafty,\" she said, looking pointedly past Trigger. The door closed\non Trigger's face. A second later, she heard the lock snap shut. A\nmoment after that, the don't-disturb sign appeared.\n\nWell, she thought, wandering back to her cabin, it didn't look as if she\nwere going to be bothered with excessively friendly neighbors on this\ntrip.\n\nShe had a bath and then discovered a mechanical stylist in a recess\nbeside the bathroom mirror. She swung the gadget out into the room, set\nit for a dye removal operation and sat down beneath it. A redhead again\na minute or so later, she switched the machine to Orado styles and left\nit to make up its electronic mind as to what would be the most suitable\ncreation under the circumstances.\n\nThe stylist hovered above her for over a minute, muttering and clucking\nas it conducted an apparently disapproving survey of the job. Then it\nwent swiftly and silently to work. When it shut itself off, Trigger\nchecked the results in the mirror.\n\nShe wasn't too pleased. An upswept arrangement which brought out the\nbone structure of her face rather well but didn't do much else for her.\nPossibly the stylist had included the Automatic Sales dress in its\ncomputations.\n\nWell, it would have to do for her first tour of the ship.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nThe bedside ComWeb warned her politely that it was now ten minutes to\ndive point. Waking passengers who experienced subspace distress in any\nform could obtain immediate assistance by a call on any ComWeb. If they\npreferred, they could have their cabins kept under the continuous visual\nsupervision of their personal steward or stewardess.\n\nThe Dawn City's passenger areas still looked rather well populated when\nTrigger arrived. But some of the passengers were showing signs of\nregretting their decision to stay awake. Presently she became aware of a\nfaint queasiness herself.\n\nIt wasn't bad--mainly a sensation as if the ship were trying\ncontinuously to turn over on its axis around her and not quite making\nit--and she knew from previous experience that after the first hour or\nso she would be completely free of that. She walked into a low, dimly\nlit, very swank-looking gambling room, still well patronized by the\nhardier section of her fellow travelers, searching for a place where she\ncould sit down unobtrusively for a while and let the subspace reaction\nwork itself out.\n\nA couch beside a closed door near the unlit end of the room seemed about\nright for the purpose.\n\nTrigger sat down and glanced around. There were a variety of games in\nprogress, all unfamiliar to her. The players were mostly men, but a\nremarkable number of beautiful women, beautifully gowned, stood around\nthe tables as observers. Traveler's Companions, Trigger realized\nsuddenly--the Dawn City's employees naturally would be inured to\nsubspace effects. From the scraps of talk she could pick up, the stakes\nseemed uniformly high.\n\nA swirl of vertigo suddenly built up in her again. This one was stronger\nthan most; for a moment she couldn't be sure whether she was going to be\nsick or not. She stood up, stepped over to the door a few feet away,\npulled it open and went through, drawing it shut behind her.\n\nThere had been a shielding black-light screen in the doorway. On the\nother side was bottled sunshine.\n\nShe found herself on a long balcony which overlooked a formal garden\nenclosure thirty feet below. There was no one else in sight. She leaned\nback against the wall beside the door, closed her eyes and breathed\nslowly and deeply for some seconds. The sickish sensation began to\nfade.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she saw the little yellow man.\n\nHe stood motionless at the far end of the garden, next to some flowering\nshrubbery out of which he might have just stepped. He seemed to be\npeering along the sand path which curved in toward the balcony and\nvanished beneath it, below the point where Trigger stood.\n\nIt was sheer fright which immobilized her at first. Because there was\nnot anything really human about that small, squat, manshaped figure. A\ndwarfish yellow demon he seemed, evil and menacing. The garden, she\nrealized suddenly, might be an illusion scene. Or else--\n\nThe thing moved in that instant. It became a blur of motion along the\ncurving path and disappeared under the balcony. After a second or so she\nheard the sound of a door closing some distance away. The garden lay\nstill again.\n\nTrigger stayed where she was, her knees shaking a little. The fright\nappeared to have driven every trace of nausea out of her, and gradually\nher heartbeat began to return to normal. She took three cautious steps\nforward to the balcony railing, where the tip of a swaying green tree\nbranch was in reach.\n\nShe put her hand out hesitantly, felt the smooth vegetable texture of a\nleaf, grasped it, pulled it away. She moved back to the door and\nexamined the leaf. It was a quite real leaf. Thin sap formed a bead of\namber moisture at the break in the stalk as she looked at it.\n\nNo illusion structure could be elaborated to that extent.\n\nSo she'd just had her first dive hallucination--and it had been a dilly!\n\nTrigger dropped the leaf, pushed shakily at the balcony door, and\nstepped back through the black-light screen into the reassuring murmur\nof human voices in the gambling room.\n\nAn hour later, the ship's loudspeaker system went on. It announced that\nthe Dawn City would surface in fifteen minutes because of gravitic\ndisturbances, and proceed the rest of the way to Evalee in normal space,\narriving approximately five hours behind schedule. Rest cubicle\npassengers would not be disturbed, unless this was specifically\nrequested by a qualified associate.\n\nTrigger turned her attention back to her viewer, feeling rather\nrelieved. She hadn't experienced any further hallucinations, or other\nindications of subspace distress; but the one she'd had would do her for\na while. The little viewer library she was in was otherwise deserted,\nand she'd been going about her studies there just the least bit\nnervously.\n\nSubject of the studies were the Hub's principal games of chance. She'd\nidentified a few of those she'd been watching--and one of them did look\nas if someone who went at it with an intelligent understanding of the\nodds--\n\nA part of Trigger kept tut-tutting and shaking its head at such reckless\nnotions. But another part pointed out that they couldn't be much worse\noff financially than they were right now. So what if they arrived in\nManon dead-broke instead of practically? Besides, there was the problem\nof remaining inconspicuous till they got there. On the Dawn City no one\nwhose wardrobe was limited to one Automatic Sales dress was going to\nremain inconspicuous very long.\n\nTrigger-in-toto went on calculating the odds for various possible play\ncombinations. She developed her first betting system, presently\ndiscovered several holes in it, and began to develop another.\n\nThe loudspeaker system went on again. She was too absorbed to pay much\nattention to it at first. Then she suddenly straightened up and\nlistened, frowning.\n\nThe man speaking now was the liner's First Security Officer. He was\nbeing very polite and regretful. Under Section such and such, Number so\nand so, of the Federation's Legal Code, a cabin by cabin search of the\npassenger area of the Dawn City had become necessary. The persons of\npassengers would not be searched. Passengers might, if they wished, be\npresent while their cabins were inspected; but this was not required.\nBaggage need not be opened, providing its spyproofing was not activated.\nAny information revealed by the search which did not pertain to a\nviolation of the Code Section and Number in question would not be\nrecorded and could not be introduced as future legal evidence under any\ncircumstances. Complaints regarding the search could be addressed to any\nPlanetary Moderator's office.\n\nThis wasn't good at all! Trigger stood up. The absence of luggage in her\ncabin mightn't arouse more than passing interest in the searchers. Her\ngun was a different matter. Discreet inquiries regarding a female\npassenger who carried a double-barreled sporting Denton might be one of\nthe check methods used by the Scout Intelligence boys if they started\nthinking of liners which recently had left Maccadon in connection with\nTrigger's disappearance. There weren't likely to be more than two or\nthree guns of that type on board, and it was almost certain that she\nwould be the only woman who owned one.\n\nShe'd better go get the Denton immediately ... and then vanish again\ninto the public sections of the ship! Some Security officer with a good\nmemory and a habit of noticing faces might identify her otherwise from\nthe news viewer pictures taken on Manon.\n\nAnd he just might start wondering then why she was traveling as Birna\nDrellgannoth--and start to check.\n\nShe paused long enough to get the Legal Code article referred to into\nthe viewer.\n\nSomebody on board appeared to have got himself murdered.\n\nShe reached the cabin too late. A couple of young Security men already\nwere going over it. Trigger said hello pleasantly. It was too bad, but\nit wasn't their fault. They just had a job to do.\n\nThey smiled back at her, apologized for the intrusion and went on with\ntheir business. She sat down and watched them. The Denton was there in\nplain sight. Dropping it into her purse now would be more likely to fix\nit in their memory than leaving it where it was.\n\nThe gadgets they were using were in concealing casings, and she couldn't\nguess what they were looking for by the way they used them. It didn't\nseem that either of them was trying to haul up an identifying memory\nabout her. They did look a little surprised when the second cabin closet\nwas opened and found to be as empty as the first; but no comments were\nmade about that. Two minutes after Trigger had come in, they were\nfinished and bowed themselves out of the cabin again. They turned then\ntoward the cabin occupied by the ancient retainers of the Askab of\nElfkund.\n\nTrigger left her door open. This she wanted to hear, if she could.\n\nShe heard. The Elfkund door also stayed open, while the racket beyond it\ngrew shriller by the moment. Finally a ComWeb chimed. A feminine voice\nspoke sternly. The Quavering outcries subsided. It looked as if Security\nhad been obliged to call on someone higher up in the Elfkund entourage\nto come to its aid. Trigger closed her door grinning.\n\nOn the screen of her secluded library, she presently watched a great\nport shuttle swing in from Evalee to meet the hovering Dawn City. It\nwould bring another five hundred or so passengers on board and take off\nthe few who had merely been making the short run from Maccadon to Evalee\nin style. Solidopic operators were quite likely to be on the shuttle, so\nshe had decided to keep away from the entry area.\n\nThe transfer operation was carried out very expeditiously, probably to\nmake up for some of the time lost on the surface. When the shuttle\nshoved off, the loudspeaker announced that normal space flight would be\nmaintained till after the stopover at Garth. Trigger wandered\nthoughtfully back to her cabin. She closed the door behind her.\n\nThen she saw the man sitting by the ComWeb cabinet. Her breath sucked\nin. She crouched a little, ready to wheel and bolt.\n\n\"Take it easy, Trigger!\" Major Quillan said. He was in civilian clothes,\nof rather dudish cut.\n\nTrigger swallowed. There was, too obviously, no place to bolt to. \"How\ndid you find me?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Longish story. You're not under arrest.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Quillan. \"When we get to Manon, the Commissioner will have a\nsuggestion to make to you.\"\n\n\"Suggestion?\" Trigger said warily.\n\n\"I believe you're to take back your old Precol job in Manon, but as\ncover for your participation in our little project. If you agree to it.\"\n\n\"What if I don't?\"\n\nHe shrugged again. \"It seems you'll be writing your own ticket from here\non out.\"\n\nTrigger stared at him, wondering. \"Why?\"\n\nQuillan grinned. \"New instructions have been handed down,\" he said. \"If\nyou're still curious, ask Whatzzit.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Trigger said. \"Then why are you here?\"\n\n\"I,\" said Quillan, \"am to make damn sure you get to Manon. I brought a\nfew people with me.\"\n\n\"Mihul, too?\" Trigger asked, a shade diffidently.\n\n\"No. She's on Maccadon.\"\n\n\"Is she--how's she doing?\"\n\n\"Doing all right,\" Quillan said. \"She sends her regards and says a\nlittle less heft on the next solar plexus you torpedo should be good\nenough.\"\n\nTrigger flushed. \"She isn't sore, is she?\"\n\n\"Not the way you mean,\" he considered. \"Not many people have jumped\nMihul successfully. In her cockeyed way, she seemed pretty proud of her\nstudent.\"\n\nTrigger felt the flush deepen. \"I got her off her guard,\" she said.\n\n\"Obviously,\" said Quillan. \"In any ordinary argument she could pull your\nlegs off and tie you up with them. Still, that wasn't bad. Have you\ntalked to anybody since you came on board?\"\n\n\"Just the room stewardess. And a couple of old ladies in the next\ncabin.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Couple of old ladies. What did you talk about?\"\n\nTrigger recounted the conversation. He reflected, nodded and stood up.\n\n\"I put a couple of suitcases in that closet over there,\" he said. \"Your\npersonal stuff is in them, de-tracered. Another thing--somebody checked\nover your finances and came to the conclusion you're broke.\"\n\n\"Not exactly broke,\" said Trigger.\n\nQuillan reached into a pocket, pulled out an envelope and laid it on the\ncabinet. \"Here's a little extra spending money then,\" he said. \"The\nbalance of your Precol pay to date. I had it picked up on Evalee this\nmorning. Seven hundred twenty-eight FC.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Trigger said. \"I can use some of that.\"\n\nThey stood looking at each other.\n\n\"Any questions?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" Trigger said. \"But you wouldn't answer them.\"\n\n\"Try me, doll,\" said Quillan. \"But let's shift operations to the\nfanciest cocktail lounge on this thing before you start. I feel like\nrelaxing a little. For just one girl, you've given us a fairly rough\ntime these last forty-eight hours!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"I'll bet,\" said Quillan.\n\nTrigger glanced at the closet. If he'd brought everything along, there\nwas a dress in one of those suitcases that would have been a little too\ndaring for Maccadon. It should, therefore, be just about right for a\ncocktail lounge on the Dawn City; and she hadn't had a chance to wear it\nyet. \"Give me ten minutes to change.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Quillan started toward the door. \"By the way, I'm your neighbor\nnow.\"\n\n\"The cabin at the end of the hall?\" she asked startled.\n\n\"That's right.\" He smiled at her. \"I'll be back in ten minutes.\"\n\nWell, that was going to be cosy! Trigger found the dress, shook it out\nand slipped into it, enormously puzzled but also enormously relieved.\nThat Whatzzit!\n\nFreshening up her make-up, she wondered how he had induced the Elfkund\nladies to leave. Perhaps he'd managed to have a better cabin offered to\nthem. It must be convenient to have that kind of a pull.\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\"Well, we didn't just leave it up to them,\" Quillan said. \"Ship's\nEngineering spotted a radiation leak in their cabin. Slight but\ndefinite. They got bundled out in a squawking hurry.\" He added, \"They\ndid get a better cabin though.\"\n\n\"Might have been less trouble to get me to move,\" Trigger remarked.\n\n\"Might have been. I didn't know what mood you'd be in.\"\n\nTrigger decided to let that ride. This cocktail lounge was a very\ncurious place. By the looks of it, there were thirty or forty people in\ntheir immediate vicinity; but if one looked again in a couple of\nminutes, there might be an entirely different thirty or forty people\naround. Sitting in easy chairs or at tables, standing about in small\ngroups, talking, drinking, laughing, they drifted past slowly; overhead,\nbelow, sometimes tilted at odd angles--fading from sight and presently\nreturning.\n\nIn actual fact she and Quillan were in a little room by themselves, and\nwith more than ordinary privacy via an audio block and a reconstruct\nscrambler which Quillan had switched on at their entry. \"I'll leave us\nout of the viewer circuit,\" he remarked, \"until you've finished your\nquestions.\"\n\n\"Viewer circuit?\" she repeated.\n\nQuillan waved a hand around. \"That,\" he said. \"There are more commercial\nand industrial spies, political agents, top-class confidence men and\nwhatnot on board this ship than you'd probably believe. A good\npercentage of them are pretty fair lip readers, and the things you want\nto talk about are connected with the Federation's hottest current\nsecret. So while it's a downright crime not to put you on immediate\ndisplay in a place like this, we won't take the chance.\"\n\nTrigger let that ride too. A group had materialized at an oblong table\neight feet away while Quillan was speaking. Everybody at the table\nseemed fairly high, and two of the couples were embarrassingly amorous;\nbut she couldn't quite picture any of them as somebody's spies or\nagents. She listened to the muted chatter. Some Hub dialect she didn't\nknow.\n\n\"None of those people can see or hear us then?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not until we want them to. Viewer gives you as much privacy as you\nlike. Most of the crowd here just doesn't see much point to privacy.\nLike those two.\"\n\nTrigger followed his glance. At a tilted angle above them, a matched\npair of black-haired, black-gowned young sirens sat at a small table,\nsipping their drinks, looking languidly around.\n\n\"Twins,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"No,\" said Quillan. \"That's Blent and Company.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Blent's a lady of leisure and somewhat excessively narcissistic\ntendencies,\" he explained. He gave the matched pair another brief study.\n\"Perhaps one can't really blame her. One of them's her facsimile.\nBlent--whichever it is--is never without her face.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Trigger said. She'd been studying the gowns. \"That,\" she said, a\ntrifle enviously, \"is why I'm not at all eager to go on display here.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Quillan.\n\nTrigger turned to regard herself in the wall mirror on the right, which,\nshe had noticed, remained carefully unobscured by drifting viewers and\nviewees. A thoughtful touch on the lounge management's part.\n\n\"Until we walked in here,\" she explained, \"I thought this was a pretty\nsharp little outfit I'm wearing.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" Quillan said judiciously. He made a detailed appraisal of the\nmirror image of the slim, green, backless, half-thigh-length sheath\nwhich had looked so breath-taking and seductive in a Ceyce display\nwindow. Trigger's eyes narrowed a little. The major had appraised the\ndress in detail before.\n\n\"It's about as sharp a little outfit as you could get for around a\nhundred and fifty credits,\" he remarked. \"Most of the items the girls\nare sporting here are personality conceptions. That starts at around ten\nto twenty times as high. I wasn't talking about displaying the dress.\nNow what were those questions?\"\n\nTrigger took a small sip of her drink, considering. She hadn't made up\nher mind about Major Quillan, but until she could evaluate him more\ndefinitely, it might be best to go by appearances. The appearances so\nfar indicated small sips in his company.\n\n\"How did you people find me so quickly?\" she asked.\n\n\"Next time you want to sneak off a civilized planet,\" Quillan advised\nher, \"pick something like a small freighter. Or hire a small-boat to get\nyou out of the system and flag down a freighter for you. Plenty of tramp\ncaptains will make a space stop to pick up a paying passenger. Liners we\ncan check.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Trigger said meekly. \"I'm still new at this business.\"\n\n\"And thank God for that!\" said Quillan. \"If you have the time and the\nmoney, it's also a good idea, of course, to zig a few times before you\nzag towards where you're really heading. Actually, I suppose, the credit\nfor picking you up so fast should go to those collating computers.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Major Quillan looked broodingly at his drink for a moment. \"There\nthey sit,\" he remarked suddenly, \"with their stupid plastic faces\nhanging out! Rows of them. You feed them something you don't understand.\nThey don't understand it either. Nobody can tell me they can. But they\nkick it around and giggle a bit, and out comes some ungodly suggestion.\"\n\n\"So they helped you find me?\" she said cautiously. It was clear that the\nmajor had strong feelings about computers.\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" he said. \"It usually turns out it was a good idea to do what\nthose CCs say. Anything unusual that shows up in the area you're working\non gets chunked into the things as a matter of course. We were on the\nliners. Dawn City reports back a couple of murders. 'Dawn City to the\nhead of the list!' cry the computers. Nobody asks why. They just plow\ninto the ticket purchase records. And right there are the little Argee\nthumbprints!\"\n\nHe looked at Trigger. \"My own bet,\" he said, somewhat accusingly, \"was\nthat you were one of those that had just taken off. We didn't know about\nthat ticket reservation.\"\n\n\"What I don't see,\" Trigger said, changing the subject, \"is why two\nmurders should seem so very unusual. There must be quite a few of them,\nafter all.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Quillan. \"But not murders that look like catassin\nkillings.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said startled. \"Is that what these were?\"\n\n\"That's what Ship Security thinks.\"\n\nTrigger frowned. \"But what could be the connection--\"\n\nQuillan reached across the table and patted her hand. \"You've got it!\"\nhe said with approval. \"Exactly! No connection. Some day I'm going to\nwalk down those rows and give them each a blast where it will do the\nmost good. It will be worth being broken for.\"\n\nTrigger said, \"I thought that catassin planet was being guarded.\"\n\n\"It is. It would be very hard to sneak one out nowadays. But somebody's\nbreeding them in the Hub. Just a few. Keeps the price up.\"\n\nTrigger grimaced uncomfortably. She'd seen recordings of those swift,\nclever, constitutionally murderous creatures in action. \"You say it\nlooked like catassin killings. They haven't found it?\"\n\n\"No. But they think they got rid of it. Emptied the air from most of the\nship after they surfaced and combed over the rest of it with life\ndetectors. They've got a detector system set up now that would spot a\ncatassin if it moved twenty feet in any direction.\"\n\n\"Life detectors go haywire out of normal space, don't they?\" she said.\n\"That's why they surfaced then.\"\n\nQuillan nodded. \"You're a well-informed doll. They're pretty certain\nit's been sucked into space or disposed of by its owner, but they'll go\non looking till we dive beyond Garth.\"\n\n\"Who got killed?\"\n\n\"A Rest Warden and a Security officer. In the rest cubicle area. It\nmight have been sent after somebody there. Apparently it ran into the\ntwo men and killed them on the spot. The officer got off one shot and\nthat set off the automatic alarms. So pussy cat couldn't finish the job\nthat time.\"\n\n\"It's all sort of gruesome, isn't it?\" Trigger said.\n\n\"Catassins are,\" Quillan agreed. \"That's a fact.\"\n\nTrigger took another sip. She set down her glass. \"There's something\nelse,\" she said reluctantly.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"When you said you'd come on board to see I got to Manon, I was thinking\nnone of the people who'd been after me on Maccadon could know I was on\nthe Dawn City. They might though. Quite easily.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Quillan.\n\n\"Yes. You see I made two calls to the ticket office. One from a street\nComWeb and one from the bank. If they already had spotted me by that\ntracer material, they could have had an audio pick-up on me, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I think we'd better suppose it,\" said Quillan. \"You had a tail when you\ncame out of the bank anyway.\" His glance went past her. \"We'll get back\nto that later. Right now, take a look at that entrance, will you?\"\n\nTrigger turned in the direction he'd indicated.\n\n\"They do look like they're somebody important,\" she said. \"Do you know\nthem?\"\n\n\"Some of them. That gentleman who looks like he almost has to be the\nDawn City's First Captain really is the Dawn City's First Captain. The\nlady he's escorting into the lounge is Lyad Ermetyne. The Ermetyne.\nYou've heard of the Ermetynes?\"\n\n\"The Ermetyne Wars? Tranest?\" Trigger said doubtfully.\n\n\"They're the ones. Lyad is the current head of the clan.\"\n\nThe history of Hub systems other than one's own became so involved so\nrapidly that its detailed study was engaged in only by specialists.\nTrigger wasn't one. \"Tranest is one of the restricted planets now, isn't\nit?\" she ventured.\n\n\"It is. Restriction is supposed to be a handicap. But Tranest is also\none of the wealthiest individual worlds in the Hub.\"\n\nTrigger watched the woman with some interest as the party moved along a\ndim corridor, followed by the viewer circuit's invisible pick-up. Lyad\nErmetyne didn't look more than a few years older than she was herself.\nRather small, slender, with delicately pretty features. She wore\nsomething ankle-length and long-sleeved in lusterless gray with an odd,\nsmoky quality to it.\n\n\"Isn't she the empress of Tranest or something of the sort?\" Trigger\nasked.\n\nQuillan shook his head. \"They've had no emperors there, technically,\nsince they had to sign their treaty with the Federation. She just owns\nthe planet, that's all.\"\n\n\"What would she be doing, going to Manon?\"\n\n\"I'd like to know,\" Quillan said. \"The Ermetyne's a lady of many\ninterests. Now--see the plump elderly man just behind her?\"\n\n\"The ugly one with the big head who sort of keeps blinking?\"\n\n\"That one. He's Belchik Pluly and--\"\n\n\"Pluly?\" Trigger interrupted. \"The Pluly Lines?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"Oh--nothing really. I heard--a friend of mine--Pluly's got a yacht out\nin the Manon System. And a daughter.\"\n\nQuillan nodded. \"Nelauk.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"I've met her. Quite a girl, that Nelauk. Only child of Pluly's old age,\nand he dotes on her. Anyway, he's been on the verge of being\nblack-listed by Grand Commerce off and on through the past three\ndecades. But nobody's ever been able to pin anything more culpable on\nhim than that he keeps skimming extremely close to the limits of a large\nnumber of laws.\"\n\n\"He's very rich, I imagine?\" Trigger said thoughtfully.\n\n\"Very. He'd be much richer even if it weren't for his hobby.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Harems. The Pluly harems rate among the most intriguing and best\neducated in the Hub.\"\n\nTrigger looked at Pluly again. \"Ugh!\" she said faintly.\n\nQuillan laughed. \"The Pluly salaries are correspondingly high. Viewer's\ndropping the group now, so there's just one more I'd like you to notice.\nThe tall girl with black hair, in orange.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Yes. I see her. She's beautiful.\"\n\n\"So she is. She's also Space Scout Intelligence. Gaya. Comes from\nFarnhart where they use the single name system. A noted horsewoman, very\nwealthy, socially established. Which is why we like to use her in\nsituations like this.\"\n\nTrigger was silent a moment. Then she said, \"What kind of situation is\nit? I mean, what's she doing with Lyad Ermetyne and the others?\"\n\n\"She probably attached herself to the group as soon as she discovered\nLyad had come on board. Which,\" Quillan said, \"is exactly what I would\nhave told Gaya to do if I'd spotted Lyad first.\"\n\nTrigger was silent a little longer this time. \"Were you thinking this\nLyad could be....\"\n\n\"One of our suspects? Well,\" said Quillan judiciously, \"let's say Lyad\nhas all the basic qualifications. Since she's come on board, we'd better\nconsider her. When something's going on that looks more than usually\ntricky, Lyad is always worth considering. And there's one point that\nlooks even more interesting to me now than it did at first.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Those two little old ladies I eased out of their rightful cabin.\"\n\nTrigger looked at him. \"What about them?\"\n\n\"This about them. The Askab of Elfkund is, you might way, one of the\nbranch managers of the Ermetyne interests in the Hub. He is also a\nhard-working heel in his own right. But he's not the right size to be\none of the people we're thinking about. Lyad is. He might have been\ndoing a job for her.\"\n\n\"Job?\" she asked. She laughed. \"Not with those odd little grannies?\"\n\n\"We know the odd little grannies. They're the Askab's poisoners and\npretty slick at it. They were sizing you up while you were having that\nlittle chat, doll. Probably not for a coffin this time. You were just\ngetting the equivalent of a pretty thorough medical check-up.\nPresumably, though, for some sinister ultimate purpose.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Trigger asked, very uncomfortably.\n\n\"One of those little suitcases in their cabin was a diagnostic recorder.\nIt would have been standing fairly close to the door while you were\nthere. If they didn't take your recordings out before I got there,\nthey're still inside. They're being watched and they know it. It seemed\nlike a good idea to keep the Askab feeling fairly nervous until we found\nout whether those sweethearts of his had been parked next door to you on\npurpose.\"\n\n\"Apparently they were,\" Trigger admitted. \"Nice bunch of people!\"\n\n\"Oh, they're not all bad. Lyad has her points. And old Belchik, for\nexample, isn't really a heel. He just had no ethics. Or morals. And\nrevolting habits. Anyway, all this brings up the matter of what we\nshould do with you now.\"\n\nTrigger set her glass down on the table.\n\n\"Refill?\" Quillan inquired. He reached for the iced crystal pitcher\nbetween them.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I just want to make a statement.\"\n\n\"State away.\" He refilled his own glass.\n\n\"For some reason,\" said Trigger, \"I've been acting lately--the last two\ndays--in a remarkably stupid manner.\"\n\nQuillan choked. He set his glass down hastily, reached over and patted\nher hand. \"Doll,\" he said, touched, \"it's come to you! At last.\"\n\nShe scowled at him. \"I don't usually act that way.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Quillan, \"was what had me so baffled. According to the\nCommissioner and others, you're as bright in the head as a diamond,\nusually. And frankly--\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Trigger said dangerously. \"Don't rub it in!\"\n\n\"I apologize,\" said Quillan. He patted her other hand.\n\n\"At any rate,\" Trigger said, drawing her hands back, \"now that I've\nrealized it, I'm going to make up for it. From here on out, I'll\ncooperate.\"\n\n\"To the hilt?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"To the hilt! Whatever that is.\"\n\n\"You can't imagine,\" said Quillan, \"how much that relieves me.\" He\nfilled her glass, giving her a relieved look. \"I had definite\ninstructions, of course, not to do anything like grabbing you by the\nback of the neck, flinging you into a rest cubicle and sitting on it,\nguns drawn, until we'd berthed in Precol Port. But I was tempted, I can\ntell you.\"\n\nHe paused and thought. \"You know,\" he began again, \"that really would be\nthe best.\"\n\n\"No!\" Trigger said indignantly. \"When I said cooperate, I meant\nactively. Mihul said I'm considered one of the gang in this project.\nFrom now on I'll behave like one. And I'll also expect to be treated\nlike one.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Quillan. \"Well, there is something you can do, all right.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Go on display here, now.\"\n\n\"What for?\" she asked.\n\n\"As bait, you sweet ninny! If the boss grabber is on this ship, we\nshould draw a new nibble from him.\" He appraised the green dress in the\nmirror again. His expression grew absent. It might be best, Trigger\nsuspected, a trifle uneasily, to keep Major Quillan's thoughts turned\naway from things like nibbling.\n\n\"All right,\" she said briskly. \"Let's do that. But you'll have to brief\nme.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nShe had felt somewhat self-conscious for the first two or three minutes.\nBut it helped when she caught a glimpse of their own table drifting by\namong the others and realized that the smiling red-headed viewer image\nover there looked completely at her ease.\n\nIt helped, too, that Major Quillan turned suddenly into the\nlight-but-ardent-conversation type of companion. In the short preceding\nbriefing he had pointed out that a bit of flirting, etc., was a\nnecessary, or at least nearly necessary, part of the act. Trigger was\ngoing along with the flirting; he could be right about that. She\nintended to stay on the alert for the etc.\n\nThey got nibbles very promptly. But not quite the right kind.\n\nThe concealed table ComWeb murmured, \"A caller requests to be connected\nwith Major Quillan. Is it permitted?\"\n\n\"Oho!\" Quillan said poisonously. \"I suspected we should have stayed off\ncircuit! Who's the caller?\"\n\n\"The name given is Keth Deboll.\"\n\nQuillan laughed. \"Give the little wolf Major Quillan's regards and tell\nhim it was a good try. I'll look him up tomorrow.\"\n\nHe gave Trigger gentle wink. \"Let 'em pant,\" he said. \"At a distance!\"\n\nShe smiled uncertainly. If he had a mustache, she thought, he'd be\ntwirling it.\n\nThere were two more calls in the next few minutes, of similar nature.\nQuillan rebuffed them cheerfully. It was rather flattering in a way. She\nwondered how so many people in the cocktail lounge happened to know\nQuillan by name.\n\nWhen the ComWeb reported the fourth caller, it sounded awed.\n\n\"The name given is the Lady Lyad Ermetyne!\" it said.\n\nQuillan beamed. \"Lyad? Bless her heart! A pleasure. Put her through.\"\n\nA screen shaped itself on the wall mirror to the right. Lyad Ermetyne's\nface appeared in it.\n\n\"Heslet Quillan!\" She smiled. \"So you aren't permanently lost to your\nfriends, after all!\" It was a light, liquid voice. It suited her\nappearance perfectly.\n\n\"Only to the frivolous ones,\" Quillan said. His thick black brows went\nup. His face took on a dedicated look. \"I'm headed for Manon on duty.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Still with the Subspace Engineers?\"\n\n\"And with the rank of major by now,\" Quillan said.\n\n\"Congratulations! But I'd already observed that your fabulous good\nfortune hasn't deserted you in the least.\" Lyad's glance switched to\nTrigger; she smiled again. It was a pleasant, easy smile that showed\nwhite teeth. \"Would you shield your ComWeb, Quillan?\"\n\n\"Shield it?\" Quillan looked surprised. \"Why, certainly!\" He reached\nunder the edge of the table. The drifting viewer images vanished. \"Go\nahead.\"\n\nLyad's eyes turned back to Trigger. They were off-color eyes, like amber\nor a light wine, fringed with long black lashes. Very steady, very\nknowing eyes. Trigger felt herself tensing.\n\n\"Forgive me the discourtesy of inquiring directly,\" the light voice\nsaid. \"But you are Trigger Argee, aren't you?\"\n\nQuillan's hand slapped the table. He looked at Trigger and laughed.\n\"Better give up, Trigger! I told you you were much more widely known\nthan you believed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, Brule,\" Trigger muttered moodily to the solidopic propped upright\nagainst the pillow before her, \"you'd bug those pretty blue eyes out if\nyou knew who's invited me to dinner!\"\n\nBrule smiled back winningly. She lay on her cabin's bed, chin on her\ncrossed arms, eyes a dozen inches from the pretty blue ones. She\nstudied Brule's features soberly.\n\n\"Major Heslet Quillan,\" she announced suddenly in cold, even tones, \"is\na completely impossible character!\"\n\nIt was no more than the truth. She didn't mind so much that Quillan\nwouldn't tell her what he thought of Lyad Ermetyne's standing on the\nsuspect list now--there hadn't really been much opportunity for open\nconversation so far. But he and that unpleasant Belchik Pluly had\nengaged in some jovial back-slapping and rib-punching when he and\nTrigger went over to join Lyad's party at her request; and Quillan cried\nout merrily that he and Belchik had long had one great interest in\ncommon--ha-ha-ha! Then those two great buddies vanished together for a\nfull hour to take in some very special, not publicly programmed\nSensations Unlimited in the Dawn City's Inferno.\n\nLyad had smiled after them as they left. \"Aren't men disgusting?\" she\nsaid tolerantly.\n\nThat reflected on her, didn't it? She was supposed to be very good\nfriends with somebody like that! Of course Quillan must have some bit of\nIntelligence business in mind with Pluly, but there should be other ways\nof going about it. And later, when she'd been just a little stiff with\nhim, Quillan had had the nerve to tell her not to be a prude, doll!\n\nTrigger shoved the solidopic under the pillow. Then she rolled on her\nside and blinked at the wall.\n\nNaturally, Major Quillan's personal habits were none of her business. It\nwas just that in less than an hour he was to pick her up and take her to\nthe Ermetyne suite for that dinner. She was wondering how she should\nbehave towards him.\n\nReasonably pleasant but cool, she decided. But again, not too cool,\nsince she'd obligated herself to help him find out what the Tranest\ntycooness was after. Any obvious lack of friendliness between them might\nmake the job more difficult.\n\nTrigger sighed. Things were getting complicated again.\n\nWhile Quillan was indulging his baser nature among the questionable\nattractions of the Inferno, she'd shot three hundred of her Precol\ncredits on a formal black gown ... on what, yesterday, she would have\nconsidered a rather unbelievable gown. Even at an Ermetyne dinner she\ncouldn't actually look dowdy in it. And then, accompanied by Gaya, who\nhad turned out to be a very pleasant but not very communicative\ncompanion, she'd headed for a gambling room to make back the price of\nthe gown.\n\nIt hadn't worked out. The game she'd particularly studied up on turned\nout to have a five hundred minimum play. Which finished that scheme. The\nsystem she'd planned to use looked very sound, but she needed more than\none chance to try it in. She and Gaya sat down at another table, with a\ndifferent game, where you could get in for fifty credits. In eight\nminutes Trigger lost a hundred and twenty and quit.\n\nGaya won seventy-five.\n\nIt had been an interesting day, but with some unsatisfactory aspects to\nit.\n\nShe hauled the solidopic out from under the pillow again.\n\n\"And you,\" she told Brule warningly, \"seem to be playing around with\nsome very bad company, my friend! Just luck I'm coming back to see you\ndon't get into serious trouble!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe'd showered and was studying the black gown's effect before the\nmirror when the ComWeb chimed.\n\n\"Permission for audio intrusion granted,\" Trigger said casually without\nlooking around. She was getting used to this sort of thing.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Drellgannoth,\" said the ComWeb. \"A package from the\nBeldon Shop has been deposited in your mail transmitter.\" It signed off.\n\nBeldon Shop? Trigger frowned, laid the gown across a chair and went over\nto the transmitter receptacle. She opened it. A flat small green\npackage, marked \"The Styles of Beldon,\" slid out. A delicate scent came\ntrailing along with it. A small white envelope clung to the package's\ntop.\n\nInside the envelope was a card. It read:\n\n\"A peace offering. Would you wear it to dinner in token of forgiveness?\nVery humbly, Q.\"\n\nTrigger found herself smiling and wiped off the smile. Then she let it\ncome back. No point in staying grim with the character! She pulled the\npackage tab and it opened up. There were three smaller packages inside.\n\n\nShe opened the first of these and for a moment gazed doubtfully at four\nobjects like green leaf buds, each the size of her thumb. She laid them\ndown and opened the second package. This one contained a pair of very\nfancy high heels, green and pale gold.\n\nOut of the third flowed something which was, at all events,\nextraordinarily beautiful material of some kind. Velvety green ...\nshimmeringly alive. Its touch was a caress. Its perfume was like soft\nwhispers. Lifting one end with great care between thumb and finger,\nTrigger let it unfold itself to the floor.\n\nTilting her head to the side, she studied the shimmering featherweight\ncat's cradle of jewel-green ribbons that hung there.\n\nWear it?\n\nWhat _was_ it?\n\nShe reflected, found her dressing gown in one of the suitcases, slipped\nit on, sat down before the ComWeb with the mysterious ribbon\narrangement, and dialed Gaya's number.\n\nThe Intelligence girl was in her cabin and obviously had been napping.\nBut she was wide awake now. \"Shielded here!\" she said quickly as soon as\nher image cleared. \"Go ahead!\"\n\n\"It's nothing important,\" Trigger said hastily. Gaya relaxed. \"It's\njust--\" she held up the ribbons. \"Major Quillan sent me this.\"\n\nGaya uttered a small squeal. \"Oh! Beautiful! A Beldon!\"\n\n\"That's what it says.\"\n\nGaya smiled. \"He must like you!\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Trigger. She hesitated. Gaya's face grew questioning. She\nasked, \"Is something the matter?\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" said Trigger. She considered. \"If you laugh,\" she\nwarned, \"I'll hate you.\" She indicated the ribbons again. \"What is that\nBeldon really?\"\n\nGaya blinked. \"You haven't been around our decadent circles long\nenough,\" she said soberly. Then she did laugh. \"Don't hate me, Trigger!\nAnyway, it's very high fashion. It's also\"--her glance went quickly over\nTrigger--\"in excellent taste, in this case. It's a Beldon gown.\"\n\nA gown!\n\nSome of the beautiful ribbons were wider than others. None of them\nlooked as wide as they should have been. Not for a gown.\n\nDubiously, Trigger wriggled and fitted herself into the high fashion\nitem. Even before she went over to the mirror in it, she knew it\nwouldn't do. Not possibly! Styles on many Hub worlds were rather bold of\ncourse, but she was sure this effect wasn't what the Beldon's designers\nhad intended.\n\nShe stepped in front of the mirror. Her eyes widened. \"Brother!\" she\nbreathed.\n\nThat Beldon did go with a woman like stripes went with a tiger! After\none look, you couldn't quite understand why nature hadn't arranged for\nit first. But just as obviously there wasn't nearly enough Beldon around\nat the moment.\n\nTrigger checked the time and began to feel harried. Probably she'd wind\nup wearing the black gown anyway, but at least she wanted to get this\nmatter worked out before she decided. She dialed for a drink, took two\nswallows and reflected that she might have put the thing on backwards.\nOr upside down.\n\nFive minutes later, she sat at the dresser, tapping her fingers on its\nglassy surface, gazing at the small pile of green ribbons before her and\nwhistling softly. There was a thoroughly bared look on her face.\nSuddenly she stood up and went back to the ComWeb.\n\n\"Ribbons?\" said the lady who was the Beldon Shop's manager. \"That would\nbe 741. A delightful little creation!\"\n\n\"Delightful,\" said Trigger. \"May I see it on the model?\"\n\n\"Immediately, madam.\"\n\nA few moments later, a long-limbed model strolled into the view screen,\ndisplaying an exquisite arrangement of burnt sienna ribbons plus four\nlargish leaf-like designs. Trigger glanced quickly back to the table\nwhere she had put down the strange green buds. They had quietly opened\nout meanwhile.\n\nShe thanked the manager, switched off the ComWeb, got into the Beldon\nagain and attached her leaf designs where the model had carried them.\nThey adhered softly, molding themselves to her, neatly completing the\ncostume.\n\nShe stepped into the high heels and looked in the mirror again. She\nbreathed \"Brother!\" again. Maccadon wouldn't have approved. She wasn't\nsure she approved either.\n\nBut one thing was certain--there wasn't the remotest suggestion of\ndowdiness about a Beldon. Objectively, impersonally considered, the\neffect was terrific.\n\nFeeling tawny and feline, Trigger slowly lifted one shoulder and lowered\nit again. She turned and strolled toward the full-length mirror across\nthe cabin, admiring the shifts of the Beldon effect in the flow of\nmotion.\n\nTerrific!\n\nWith another drink, she could do it.\n\nShe dialed another drink and settled down with it beneath the mechanical\nstylist for a readjustment in the hairdo department. This time the\nstylist purred as it surveyed and hummed while it worked. And when the\nhairdo was done and Trigger moved to get up, its flexible little tool\npads pulled her back gently into the seat and tilted up her chin. For a\nmoment she was startled. Then she saw that the stylist had produced a\nshining make-up kit and was opening it. This time she was getting the\nworks....\n\nTwenty minutes later, Quillan's voice informed her via the ComWeb that\nhe could be outside her cabin any time she was ready. Trigger told him\ncheerily to come right over, picked up her purse and swaggered toward\nthe door, smiling a cool, feline smile.\n\n\"Prude, eh?\" she muttered.\n\nShe opened the door.\n\n\"Ya-arghk!\" cried Quillan, shaken.\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nThey were out on a terrace near the top of an illusion mountainside, in\na beautiful evening. Dinner had been old-style and delicious, served by\nits creators, two slim, brown-skinned, red-lipped girls who looked much\ntoo young to have acquired such skills. They were natives of Tranest,\nLyad said proudly, and two of the finest food technicians in the Hub.\nThey were, at all events, the two finest food technicians Trigger had\nrun into as yet.\n\nThe brandy which followed the dinner seemed to represent no let-down to\nthe connoisseurs around Trigger. She went at it cautiously, though she\nhad swallowed a couple of wake-up capsules just before they walked into\nthe Ermetyne suite. The capsules took effect in the middle of the first\ncourse; and what she woke up to was a disconcerting awareness of being\nthe center of much careful attention. The boys were all giving\nher-plus-Beldon the eye, intensively; even Lyad's giant-sized butler or\nmajordomo or whatever she'd called him, named Virod, ogled coldly out of\nthe background. Trigger gave them the eye back, one after the other, in\nturn; and that stopped it. Lyad, beautifully wearing something which\nwould have passed muster at the U-League's Annual Presidential Dinner in\nCeyce, looked amused.\n\nIt wasn't till the end of the second course that Trigger began to feel\nat ease again. After that she forgot, more or less, about the Beldon.\nThe talk remained light during dinner. When they switched off the\nillusion background for a look at the goings-on during the Garth\nstopover, she took the occasion to study her companions in more detail.\n\nThere were three men at the table; Lyad and herself. Quillan sat\nopposite her. Belchik Pluly's unseemly person, in a black silk robe\nwhich left his plump arms bare from the elbows down, was on Quillan's\nright.\n\nThe third man fascinated her. It was as if some strange cold creature\nhad walked up out of a polar sea to come on board their ship.\n\nIt wasn't so much his appearance, though the green tip of a Vethi sponge\nlying coiled lightly about his neck probably had something to do with\nthe impression. Trigger knew about Vethi sponges and their addicts,\nthough she hadn't seen either before. It wasn't so serious an addiction,\nexcept perhaps in the fact that it was rarely given up again. The\nsponges soothed jangled nerves, stabilized unstable emotions.\n\nBalmordan didn't look like a man who needed one. He was big, not as tall\nas Quillan but probably heavier, with strong features, a boldly jutting\nnose. Bleak, pale eyes. He was about fifty and wore a richly ornamented\nblue shirt and trousers. The shirt hung loose, perhaps to conceal the\nflattened contours of his odd companion's body. Lyad had introduced him\nas a Devagas scientist and in a manner which indicated he was a man of\nconsiderable importance. That meant he was almost certainly a member of\nthe Devagas hierarchy, which in itself would have made him very\ninteresting.\n\nTrigger had run into some of the odd-ball missionaries the Devagas kept\nsending about the Hub; and she'd sometimes speculated curiously\nregarding the leaders of that chronically angry, unpredictable nation\nwhich, on its twenty-eight restricted worlds, formed more than six\npercent of the population of the Hub. The Devagas seemed to like nobody;\nand certainly nobody liked them.\n\nBalmordan didn't fit her picture of a Devagas leader too badly. His\nmanner and talk were easygoing and agreeable. But his particular brand\nof ogle, when she first became aware of it, had been disquieting. Rather\nlike a biologist planning the details of an interesting vivisection.\n\nOf course he _was_ a biologist.\n\nBut Trigger kept wondering why Lyad had invited him to dinner. She was\npositive, for one thing, that Belchik Pluly wasn't at all happy about\nBalmordan's presence.\n\nDinner was over before the Garth take-off, and they switched themselves\nback to the mountainside and took other chairs. A red-haired,\ngreen-eyed, tanned, sinuous young woman called Flam appeared from time\nto time to renew brandy glasses and pass iced fruits around. She gave\nTrigger coolly speculative looks now and then.\n\nThen Virod showed up again with a flat tray of what turned out to be a\nvery special brand of tobacco. Trigger declined. The men made\nconnoisseur-type sounds of high appreciation, and everybody, including\nLyad, lit up small pipes of a very special brand of coral and puffed\naway happily. Quillan looked up at Virod.\n\n\"Hi, big boy!\" he said pleasantly. \"How's everything been with you?\"\n\nVirod, in a wide-sleeved scarlet jacket and creased black trousers,\nbowed his shaved bullet head very slightly. \"Everything's been fine,\nMajor Quillan,\" he said. \"Thank you.\" He turned and went out of the\nplace. Trigger glanced after him. Virod awed her a little--he was really\nhuge. Moving about among them, he had seemed like a softly padding\nelephant. And there was an elephant's steady deftness in the way he held\nout the tiny tobacco trays.\n\nThe Ermetyne winked at Quillan. \"Quillan wrestled Virod to a pindown\nonce,\" she said to Trigger. \"A fifty-seven minute round, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Thereabouts,\" Quillan said. He added, \"Trigger doesn't know yet that I\nwas a sports bum in my youth.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Trigger said.\n\nHe nodded. \"Come from a long line of sports bums, as a matter of fact.\nBut I broke tradition--went into business for myself finally. Nowadays\nI'm old and soft. Eh, Belchy?\" The two great pals, sitting side by side,\ndug elbows at each other and ha-ha-ha'd. Trigger winced.\n\n\"Still in the same line of business, on the side?\" Lyad inquired.\n\nQuillan looked steadily at her and grinned. \"More or less,\" he said.\n\n\"We might,\" Lyad said thoughtfully, \"come back to that later. As for\nthat match with Virod,\" she went on to Trigger, \"it was really a\nterrific event! Virod was a Tranest arena professional before I took him\ninto my personal employ, and he's very, very rarely been beaten in any\nsuch contest.\" She laughed. \"And before such a large group of people\ntoo! I'm afraid he's never quite forgiven you for that, Quillan.\"\n\n\"I'll keep out of his way,\" Quillan said easily.\n\n\"Did you people know,\" Lyad said, \"that the trouble on the way between\nMaccadon and Evalee was caused by a catassin killing?\" There was a touch\nof mischief in the question, Trigger thought.\n\nThere were assorted startled responses. The Ermetyne went briefly over\nsome of the details Quillan had told; essentially it was the same story.\n\"And do you know, Belchik, what the creature was trying to do? It was\ntrying to get into the rest cubicle vaults. Just think, it might have\nbeen sent after you!\"\n\nIt was rather cruel. Pluly's head jerked, and he blinked rapidly at\nLyad, saying nothing. He was a badly scared little man at that moment.\nTrigger felt a little sorry for him, but not too sorry. Belchy's ogle\nhad been of the straightforward, loose-lipped, drooling variety.\n\n\"You're safe when you're in one of those things, Belchik!\" Quillan said\nreassuringly. \"Wouldn't you feel a little safer there yourself, Lyad? If\nyou say they're not even sure they've killed the creature....\"\n\n\"I probably shall have a cubicle set up here,\" Lyad said. \"But not as\nprotection against a catassin. It would never get past Pilli, for one\nthing.\" She looked at Trigger. \"Oh, I forgot. You haven't met Pilli.\nVirod!\" she called.\n\nVirod appeared at the far end of the terrace.\n\n\"Yes, First Lady?\"\n\n\"Bring in Pilli,\" she told him.\n\nVirod bowed. \"Pilli is in the room, First Lady.\" He glanced about, went\nover to a massive easy chair a few feet way, and swung it aside.\nSomething like a huge ball of golden fur behind it moved and sat up.\n\nIt was an animal of some sort. Its head seemed turned toward the group,\nbut whatever features it had remained hidden under the fur. Then an arm\nlike the arm of a bear reached out and Trigger saw a great furred hand\nthat in shape seemed completely human clutch the chair's edge.\n\n\"He was resting,\" Lyad said. \"Not sleeping. Pilli doesn't sleep. He's a\nperfect guardian. Come here, Pilli--meet Trigger Argee.\"\n\nPilli swung up on his feet. It was an impressively effortless motion.\nThere was a thick wide torso on short thick legs under the golden fur.\nThe structure was gorilla-like. Pilli might weigh around four hundred\npounds.\n\nHe started silently forward and Trigger felt a tingle of alarm. But he\nstopped six feet away. She looked at him. \"Do I say something to Pilli?\"\n\nLyad looked pleased. \"No. He's a biostructure. A very intelligent one,\nbut speech isn't included in his pattern.\"\n\nTrigger kept looking at the golden-furred nightmare. \"How can he see to\nguard you through all that hair?\"\n\n\"He doesn't see,\" Lyad said. \"At least not as we do. Pilli's part of one\nof our Tranest experiments--the original stock came from the Maccadon\nlife banks, a small golden-haired Earth monkey. The present level of the\nexperiment is on the fancy side--it has four hearts, for example, and\nwhat amounts to a second brain at the lower half of its spine. But it\ndoesn't come equipped with visual organs. Pilli is one of twenty-three\nof the type. They have compensatory perception of a kind that is still\nquite mysterious. We hope to breed them past the speech barrier so they\ncan tell us what they do instead of seeing.... All right, Pilli. Run\nalong!\" She said to Balmordan, \"I believe he doesn't like that Vethi\nthing of yours very much.\"\n\nBalmordan nodded. \"I had the same impression.\"\n\nPerhaps, Trigger thought, that was why Pilli had been lurking so close\nto them. She watched the biostructure move off down the terrace,\ngrotesque and huge. She had got its scent as it went past her, a fresh,\nrather pleasant whiff, like the smell of ripe apples. An almost amiable\nsort of nightmare figure, Pilli was; the apple smell went with that,\nseemed to fit it. But nightmare was there too. She found herself feeling\nrather sorry for Pilli.\n\n\"In a way,\" Lyad said, \"Pilli brings us to that matter of business I\nmentioned this afternoon.\"\n\nThe group's eyes shifted over to her. She smiled.\n\n\"We have good scientists on Tranest,\" she said, \"as Pilli, I think,\ndemonstrates.\" She nodded at Balmordan. \"There are good scientists in\nthe Devagas Union. And everyone here is aware that the Treaties of\nRestriction imposed on both our governments have made it impossible for\nour citizens to engage seriously in plasmoid research.\"\n\nTrigger nodded briefly as the light-amber eyes paused on her for a\nmoment. Quillan had cautioned her not to show surprise at anything the\nErmetyne might say or do. If Trigger didn't know what to say herself,\nshe was merely to look inscrutable. \"I'll scrut,\" he explained. \"The\nothers won't. I'll take over then and you just follow my lead. Get it?\"\n\n\"Balmordan,\" Lyad said, \"I understand you are going to Manon to attend\nthe seminars and demonstrations on the plasmoid station?\"\n\n\"That is true, First Lady,\" said Balmordan.\n\n\"Now I,\" Lyad told the company, \"shall be more honest. The information\nreleased in those seminars is of no value whatever. He\"--she nodded at\nthe Devagas scientist--\"and I are going to Manon with the same goal in\nmind. That is to obtain plasmoids for our government laboratories.\"\n\nBalmordan smiled amiably.\n\nTrigger asked. \"How do you intend to obtain them?\"\n\n\"By offering very large sums of money, or equivalent inducements, to\npeople who are in a position to get them for me,\" said Lyad.\n\nQuillan tut-tutted disapprovingly. \"The First Lady's mind,\" he told\nTrigger, \"turns readily to illegal methods.\"\n\n\"When necessary,\" Lyad said undisturbed, \"as it is here.\"\n\n\"How about you, sir?\" Quillan asked Balmordan. \"Are we to understand\nthat you also would be interested in the purchase of a middling plasmoid\nor two?\"\n\n\"I would be, naturally,\" Balmordan said. \"But not at the risk of causing\ntrouble for my government.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Quillan said. He thought a moment. \"You, Belchy?\" he\nasked.\n\nPluly looked alarmed. \"No! No! No!\" he said hastily. He blinked wildly.\n\"I'll stick to the shipping business. It's safer.\"\n\nQuillan patted him fondly on the shoulder. \"That's one law-abiding\ncitizen in this group!\" He winked at Trigger. \"Trigger's wondering,\" he\ntold Lyad, \"why she and I are being told these things.\"\n\n\"Well, obviously,\" Lyad said, \"Trigger and you are in an excellent\nposition--or will be, very soon--to act as middlemen in the matter.\"\n\n\"Wha....\" Trigger began, astounded. Then, as all eyes swiveled over to\nher, she checked herself. \"Did you really think,\" she asked Lyad, \"that\nwe'd agree to such a thing?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Lyad. \"I don't expect anyone to agree to anything\ntonight--though it's a safe assumption I'm not the only one here who has\nmade sure this conversation is not being recorded, and will not be\navailable for reconstruction. Well, Quillan?\" She smiled.\n\n\"How right you are, First Lady!\" Quillan said. He tapped a breast\npocket. \"Scrambler and distorter present and in action.\"\n\n\"And you, Balmordan?\"\n\n\"I must admit,\" Balmordan said pleasantly, \"that I thought it wise to\ntake certain precautions.\"\n\n\"Very wise!\" said Lyad. Her glance shifted, with some amusement in it,\nto Pluly. \"Belchik?\"\n\n\"You're a nerve-wracking woman, Lyad,\" Belchik said unhappily. \"Yes. I'm\nscrambling, of course.\" He shuddered. \"I can't afford to take chances.\nNot when you're around.\"\n\n\"Of course not, and even so,\" said Lyad, \"there are still reasons why\nan unconsidered word might be embarrassing in this company. So, no,\nTrigger, I'm not expecting anybody to agree to anything tonight. I'm\nmerely mentioning that I'm interested in the purchase of plasmoids.\nIncidentally, I'd be very much more interested even in seeing you, and\nQuillan, enter my employ directly. Yes, Belchik?\"\n\nPluly had begun giggling wildly.\n\n\"I was--ha-ha--having the same idea!\" he gasped. \"About one\nof--ha-ha--of 'em anyway! I--\"\n\nHe jerked and came to an abrupt stop, transfixed by Trigger's stare.\nThen he reached for his glass, blinking at top speed. \"Excuse me,\" he\nmuttered.\n\n\"Hardly, Belchik!\" said Lyad. She gave Trigger a small wink. \"But I can\nassure you, Trigger Argee, that you'd find my pay and working conditions\nvery attractive indeed.\"\n\nIt seemed a good moment to look inscrutable. Trigger did.\n\n\"Serious about that, Lyad?\" asked Quillan.\n\nThe Ermetyne said, \"Certainly I'm serious. Both of you could be of great\nvalue to me at present.\" She looked at him a moment. \"Did you ever\nhappen to tell Trigger about the manner in which you re-established the\nfamily fortune?\"\n\n\"Not in any great detail,\" Quillan said.\n\n\"A very good hijacker and smuggler went to waste when you signed up with\nthe Engineers,\" Lyad said. \"But perhaps not entirely to waste.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" acknowledged Quillan. He grinned. \"But I'm a modest man.\nOne fortune's enough for me.\"\n\n\"There was a time, you know,\" Lyad said, \"when I was rather afraid it\nwould be necessary to have you killed.\"\n\nQuillan laughed. \"There was a time,\" he admitted, \"when I suspected you\nmight be thinking along those lines, First Lady! Didn't lose too much,\ndid you?\"\n\n\"I lost enough!\" Lyad said. She wrinkled her nose at him. \"But that's\nall over and done with. And now--no more business tonight. I promise.\"\nShe turned her head a little. \"Flam!\" she called.\n\n\"Yes, First Lady?\" said the voice of the red-headed girl.\n\n\"Bring us Miss Argee's property, please.\"\n\nFlam brought in a small package of flat disks taped together. Lyad took\nthem.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" she told Quillan, \"the Askab becomes a little independent.\nHe's been spoken to. Here--you keep them for Trigger.\"\n\nShe tossed the package lightly over to them. Quillan put out a hand and\ncaught it.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said. He put the package in a pocket. \"I'll call off my\nbeagles.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself as to that,\" said the Ermetyne. \"It won't hurt the Askab\nto stay frightened a little longer.\"\n\nShe checked herself. The room's ComWeb was signaling. Virod went over to\nit. A voice came through.\n\n\"... The Garth-Manon subspace run begins in one hour. Rest cubicles\nhave been prepared....\"\n\n\"That means me,\" Belchik Pluly said. He climbed hastily to his feet.\n\"Can't stand dives! Get hallucinations. Nasty ones.\" He staggered a\nlittle then, and Trigger realized for the first time that Belchy had got\npretty thoroughly drunk.\n\n\"Better give our guest a hand, Virod,\" Lyad called over her shoulder.\n\"Happy dreams, Belchik! Are you going by Rest, Trigger? No? You're not,\nof course, Quillan. Balmordan?\"\n\nThe Devagas scientist also shook his head.\n\n\"Then by all means,\" Lyad said, \"let's stay together a little while\nlonger.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\"She,\" said Trigger, \"is a remarkable woman.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Quillan. \"Remarkable.\"\n\n\"May I ask you, finally, a few pertinent questions?\" Trigger inquired\nhumbly.\n\n\"Not here, sweet stuff,\" said Quillan.\n\n\"You're a bossy sort of slob, Heslet Quillan,\" she said equably.\n\nQuillan didn't answer. They had come down the stairway to the storerooms\nlevel and were walking along the big lit hallway toward their cabins.\nTrigger felt pleasantly relaxed. But she did have a great many pertinent\nquestions to ask Quillan now, and she wanted to get started on them.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said suddenly. Just as suddenly, Quillan's hand was on her\nshoulder, moving her along.\n\n\"Hush now,\" he said. \"And keep walking.\"\n\n\"But you saw it, didn't you?\" Trigger asked, trying to look back to the\nsmall open door into the storerooms they'd just passed.\n\nQuillan sighed. \"Certainly,\" he said. \"Guy in space armor.\"\n\n\"But what's he doing there?\"\n\n\"Checking something, I suppose.\" His hand left her shoulder; and, for\njust a moment, his finger rested lightly across her lips. Trigger\nglanced up at him. He was walking on beside her, not looking at her.\n\nAll right, she thought--she could take a hint. But she felt tense and\nuncomfortable now. Something was going on again, apparently.\n\nThey turned into the side passage and came up to her cabin. Trigger\nstarted to turn to face him, and Quillan picked her up and went on\nwithout a noticeable break in his stride. Close to her ear, his voice\nwhispered, \"Explain in a moment! Dangerous here.\"\n\nAs the door to the end cabin closed behind them, he put her back on her\nfeet. He looked at his watch.\n\n\"We can talk here,\" he said. \"But there may not be much time for\nconversation.\" He gestured toward a table against the wall. \"Take a look\nat the setup.\"\n\nTrigger looked. The table was littered with instruments, like an\nelectronic workbench. A visual screen showed a view of both her own\ncabin and a section of the passage outside it, up to the point where it\nentered the big hall.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked uncertainly.\n\n\"Essentially,\" said Quillan, \"we've set up a catassin trap.\"\n\n\"Catassin!\" Trigger squeaked.\n\n\"That's right. Don't get too nervous though. I've caught them before.\nUsed to be a sort of specialty of mine. And there's one thing about\nthem--they'll blab their pointed little heads off if you can get one\nalive and promise it its catnip....\" He'd shucked off his jacket and\ntaken out of it a very large handgun with a bell-shaped mouth. He laid\nthe gun down next to the view screen. \"In case,\" he said,\nunreassuringly. \"Now just a moment.\"\n\nHe sat down in front of the view screen and did something to it.\n\n\"All right,\" he said then. \"We're here and set. Probability period\nstarts in three minutes, continues for sixty. Signal on any blip.\nOtherwise no gabbing. And remember they're _fast_. Don't get sappy.\"\n\nThere was no answer. Quillan did something else to the screen and stood\nup again. He looked broodingly at Trigger. \"It's those damn computers\nagain!\" he said. \"I don't see any sense in it.\"\n\n\"In what?\" she asked shakily.\n\n\"Everything that's happening around here is being fed back to them at\nthe moment,\" he said. \"When they heard about our invite to Lyad's dinner\nparty, and who was to be present, they came up with a honey. In the time\nperiod I mentioned a catassin is supposed to show up at your cabin. They\ngive it a pretty high probability.\"\n\nTrigger didn't say anything. If she had, she probably would have\nsqueaked again.\n\n\"Now don't worry,\" he said, squeezing her shoulder reassuringly between\na large thumb and four slightly less large fingers. \"Nice muscle!\" he\nsaid absently. \"The cabin's trapped and I've taken other precautions.\"\nHe massaged the muscle gently. \"Probably the only thing that will happen\nis that we'll sit around here for an hour or so, and then we'll have a\nhearty laugh together at those foolish computers!\" He smiled.\n\n\"I thought,\" Trigger said without squeaking, \"that everybody was pretty\nsure it was dead.\"\n\nQuillan frowned. \"Well, that's something else again! There are at least\ntwo ways I know of to sneak it past that search. Jump it out and in with\na subtub is one--they could have done that from their own cabin as soon\nas they had its pattern. So I don't really think it's dead. It's just--\"\n\n\"Quillan,\" a tiny voice said from the viewer.\n\nHe turned, took two steps, and sat down fast before the viewer. \"Go\nahead!\"\n\n\"Fast motion in B section. Going your way.\"\n\nFast motion. A thought flicked up. \"Quillan--\" Trigger began.\n\nHe raised a shushing hand. \"Get a silhouette?\" he asked. His hands went\nto a set of control switches and stayed there.\n\n\"No. Pickup shows a haze like in the reconstruct.\" An instant's pause.\n\"Leaving B section.\"\n\n\"Motion in C section,\" said another voice.\n\nQuillan said, \"All right. It's coming. No more verbal reports unless it\nchanges direction. If you want to stay alive, don't move unless you're\nin armor.\"\n\nThere was silence. Quillan sat unmoving, eyes fixed on the screen.\nTrigger stood just behind him. Her legs had begun to tremble. She'd\nbetter tell him.\n\n\"Quillan--\"\n\nFor an instant, in the screen, there was something like heat shimmer at\nthe far end of the passage. Then she saw her cabin door pop open.\n\nThe interior of the cabin showed in a brief flare of blue light. In it\nwas a shape. It vanished instantly again.\n\nShe heard Quillan make a shocked, incredulous sound. His left hand\nslashed at a switch on the panel.\n\nTwenty feet from them, just behind the closed door to the passage, was a\nsplatting noise like a tremendous slap. Then another noise, strangely\nlike a brief cloudburst. Then silence again.\n\nShe realized Quillan was on his feet beside her, the oversized gun in\nhis hand. It was pointed at the door. His eyes switched suddenly from\nthe door to the screen and back again. She felt him relaxing slowly.\nThen she discovered she was clutching a handful of his shirt along with\na considerable chunk of tough skin. She went on clutching it.\n\n\"Fly swatter got it!\" he said. \"Whew!\" He looked down and patted the\nclutching hand. \"No catassin! The trap in the cabin just wasn't fast\nenough. Had a gravity mine outside our door, just in case. _That_ was\nbarely fast enough!\" For once, Quillan looked almost awed.\n\n\"L-l-l-like--\" Trigger began. She tried again. \"Like a little yellow\nman--\"\n\n\"You saw it? In the cabin? Yes. Never saw anything just like it before!\"\n\nTrigger pressed her lips together to make them stay steady.\n\n\"I have,\" she said. \"That's what I was trying to tell you.\"\n\nQuillan stared at her for an instant. \"You'll tell me about it in a\ncouple of minutes. I've got some quick work to do first.\" He checked\nhimself. A wide grin spread suddenly over his face. \"Know something,\ndoll?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The damn computers!\" Major Quillan said happily. \"They goofed!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gravity mine would have reduced almost any life-form which moved\ninto its field to a rather thin smear, but there wasn't even that left\nof the yellow demon-shape. Something, presumably something it was\ncarrying, had turned it into a small blaze of incandescent energy as the\nmine flattened it out. Which explained the sound like a cloudburst. That\nhad been the passage's automatic fire extinguishers going into brief but\ncorrespondingly violent action.\n\nQuillan's group stayed out of sight for the time being. He'd barely got\nthe mine put away, along with a handful of warped metal slugs, which was\nwhat the mine had left of their attacker's mechanical equipment, and\nTrigger's cabin door locked again, when three visitors came zooming down\nthe storerooms hall in a small car. A ship's engineer and two\nassistants had arrived to check on what had started the extinguishers.\n\n\"They may,\" Quillan said hopefully, \"just go away again.\" He and Trigger\nwere watching the engineers through the viewer which had been extended\nto cover their end of the passage.\n\nThey didn't just go away again. They checked the extinguishers, looked\nat the floor, still wet but rapidly absorbing the last drops of the\nbrief deluge. They exchanged puzzled comment. They checked everything\nonce more. Finally the leader made use of the door announcer and asked\nif he might intrude.\n\nQuillan switched off the viewer. \"Come in,\" he said resignedly.\n\nThe door opened. The three glanced at Quillan, and then at\nTrigger-plus-Beldon. Their eyes widened only slightly. Duty on the Dawn\nCity produced hardened men.\n\nNeither Quillan nor Trigger could offer the slightest explanation as to\nwhat had started the extinguishers. The engineers apologized and\nwithdrew. The door closed again.\n\nQuillan switched on the viewer. Their voices came back into the cabin as\nthey climbed into their car.\n\n\"So that's how it happened,\" one of the assistants was saying\nreflectively.\n\n\"Right,\" said the ship's engineer. \"Like to burst into flames myself.\"\n\n\"Ha-ha-ha!\" They drove off.\n\nTrigger flushed. She looked at Quillan.\n\n\"Perhaps I ought to get into something else,\" she said. \"Now that the\nparty's over.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Quillan admitted. \"I'll have Gaya bring something down. We\nwant to stay out of your cabin for an hour or so till everything's been\nchecked. There'll be a few conferences to go through now.\"\n\nGaya arrived next, with clothes. Trigger retired to the cabin's bathroom\nwith them and came out a few minutes later, dressed again. Meanwhile the\nDawn City's First Security Officer also had arrived and was setting up a\nportable restructure stage in the center of the cabin. He looked rather\ngrim, but he also looked like a very much relieved man.\n\n\"I suggest we run your sequence off first, Major,\" he said. \"Then we can\nput them on together, and compare them.\"\n\nTrigger sat down on a couch beside Gaya to watch. She'd been told that\nthe momentary view of the little demon-shape in the cabin had been\ndeleted from Security's copy of their own sequence and wasn't to be\nmentioned.\n\nOtherwise there really was not too much to see. What the attacking\ncreature had used to blur the restructure wasn't clear, except that it\nwasn't a standard scrambler. Amplified to the limits of clarity and\nstepped down in time to the limit of immobility, all that emerged was a\nshifting haze of energy, which very faintly hinted at a dwarfish human\nshape in outline. A rather unusually small and heavy catassin, the\nSecurity chief pointed out, would present such an outline. That\nsomething quite material was finally undergoing devastating structural\ndisorganization on the gravity mine was unpleasantly obvious, but it\nproduced no further information. The sequence ended with the short blaze\nof heat which had set off the extinguishers.\n\nThen they ran the restructure of the preceding double killing. Trigger\nwatched, gulping a little, till it came to the point where the haze\nshape actually was about to touch its victims. Then she studied the\ncarpet carefully until Gaya nudged her to indicate the business was\nover. Catassins almost invariably used their natural equipment in the\nkill; it was a swift process, of course, but shockingly brutal, and\nTrigger didn't care to remember what the results looked like in a human\nbeing. Both men had been killed in that manner; and the purpose\nobviously was to conceal the fact that the killer was not a catassin,\nbut something even more efficient along those lines.\n\nIt didn't occur to the Security chief to question Trigger. A temporal\nrestructure of a recent event was a far more reliable witness than any\nset of human senses and memory mechanisms. He left presently, reassured\nthat the catassin incident was concluded. It startled Trigger to realize\nthat Security did not seem to be considering seriously the possibility\nof discovering the human agent behind the murders.\n\nQuillan shrugged. \"Whoever did it is covered three ways in every\ndirection. The chief knows it. He can't psych four thousand people on\ngeneral suspicions, and he'd hit mind-blocks in every twentieth\npassenger presently on board if he did. Anyway he knows we're on it, and\nthat we have a great deal better chance of nailing the responsible\ncharacters eventually.\"\n\n\"More information for the computers, eh?\" Trigger said.\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"You got this little chunk the hard way, I feel,\" she observed.\n\n\"True,\" Quillan admitted, \"But we have to get it any way we can till we\nget enough to move on. Then we move.\" He looked at her, with an air of\nregarding a new idea. \"You know,\" he said, \"you don't do badly for an\namateur!\"\n\n\"She doesn't do badly,\" Gaya's voice said behind Trigger, \"for anybody.\nHow do you people feel about a drink? I thought I could use one myself\nafter looking at the chief's restructure.\"\n\nTrigger felt herself coloring. Praise from the cloak and dagger experts!\nFor some reason it pleased her immensely. She turned her head to smile\nat Gaya, standing there with three glasses on a tray.\n\n\"Thanks!\" she said. She took one of the glasses. Gaya held the tray out\nto Quillan and took the third glass herself.\n\nIt was some five minutes later when Trigger remarked, \"You know, I'm\ngetting sleepy.\"\n\nQuillan looked around the viewer equipment he and Gaya were dismantling.\n\"Why not hit the couch over there and take a nap?\" he suggested. \"It'll\nbe about an hour before the boys can get down here for the real\nconference.\"\n\n\"Good idea.\" Trigger yawned, finished her drink, put the glass on a\ntable, and wandered over to the couch. She stretched out on it. A drowsy\nsomnolence enveloped her almost instantly. She closed her eyes.\n\nTen minutes later, Gaya, standing over her, announced, \"Well, she's\nout.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Quillan, packaging the rest of the equipment. \"Tell them to\nhaul in the rest cubicle. I'll be done here in a minute. Then you and\nthe lady warden can take over.\"\n\nGaya looked down at Trigger. There was a trace of regret in her face. \"I\nthink,\" she said, \"she's going to be fairly displeased with you when she\nwakes up and finds she's on Manon.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't doubt it,\" said Quillan. \"But from what I've seen of that\nchick, she's going to get fairly displeased with me from time to time on\nthis operation anyway.\"\n\nGaya looked at his back.\n\n\"Major Quillan,\" she said, \"would you like a tip from a keen-eyed\noperator?\"\n\n\"Go ahead, ole keen-eyed op!\" Quillan said in kindly tones.\n\n\"Not that you don't have it coming, boy,\" said Gaya. \"But watch\nyourself! This one is dangerous. This one could sink you for keeps.\"\n\n\"You're going out of your mind, doll,\" said Quillan.\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nThe Precol headquarters dome on Manon Planet was still in the spot where\nTrigger had left it, looking unchanged; but everything else in the area\nseemed to have been moved, improved, expanded or taken away entirely,\nand unfamiliar features had appeared. In the screens of Commissioner\nTate's Precol offices, Trigger could see both the new metropolitan-sized\nspaceport on which the Dawn City had set down that morning, and the\ntowering glassy structures of the giant shopping and recreation center,\nwhich had been opened here recently by Grand Commerce in its bid for a\ncut of prospective outworld salaries. The salaries weren't entirely\nprospective either.\n\nTen miles away on the other side of Headquarters dome, new squares of\nliving domes were sprouting up daily. At this morning's count they\nhoused fifty-two thousand people. The Hub's major industries and\nassorted branches of Federation government had established a solid\nfoothold on Manon.\n\nTrigger turned her head as Holati Tate came into the office. He closed\nthe door carefully behind him.\n\n\"How's the little critter doing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Still absorbing the goop,\" Trigger said. She held Mantelish's small\nmystery plasmoid cupped lightly between thumbs and fingers, its bottom\nside down in a shallow bowl half full of something which Mantelish\nconsidered to be nutritive for plasmoids, or at least for this one. Its\nsides pulsed lightly and regularly against her palms. \"The level of the\nstuff keeps going down,\" she added.\n\n\"Good,\" said Holati. He pulled a chair up to the table and sat down\nopposite her. He looked broodingly at plasmoid 113-A.\n\n\"You really think this thing _likes_ me--personally?\" Trigger inquired.\n\nHer boss said, \"It's eating, isn't it? And moving. There were a couple\nof days before you got here when it looked pretty dead to me.\"\n\n\"Hard to believe,\" Trigger observed, \"that a sort of leech-looking thing\ncould distinguish between people.\"\n\n\"This one can. Do you get any sensations while holding it?\"\n\n\"Sensations?\" She considered. \"Nothing particular. It's just like I said\nthe other time--little Repulsive is rather nice to feel.\"\n\n\"For you,\" he said. \"I didn't tell you everything.\"\n\n\"You rarely do,\" Trigger remarked.\n\n\"I'll tell you now,\" said Holati. \"The day after we left, when it\nstarted acting very agitated and then very droopy, Mantelish said it\nmight be missing the female touch it had got from you. He was being\nfacetious, I think. But I couldn't see any reason not to try it, so I\ncalled in your facsimile and had her sit down at the table where the\nthing was lying.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, first it came flying up to her, crying 'Mama!' Not actually, of\ncourse. Then it touched her hand and recoiled in horror.\"\n\nTrigger raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"It looked like it,\" he insisted. \"We all commented on it. So then she\nreached out and touched it. Then she recoiled in horror.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She said it had given her a very nasty electric jolt. Apparently like\nthe one it gave Mantelish.\"\n\nTrigger glanced down dubiously at Repulsive. \"Gee, thanks for letting me\nhold it, Holati! It seems to have stopped eating now, by the way. Or\nwhatever it does. Doesn't look much fatter if any, does it?\"\n\nThe Commissioner looked. \"No,\" he said. \"And if you weighed it, you'd\nprobably find it still weighs an exact three and a half pounds.\nMantelish feels the thing turns any food intake directly into energy.\"\n\n\"Then it should be able to produce a very nice jolt at the moment,\"\nTrigger commented. \"Now, what do I do with Repulsive?\"\n\nHolati took a towel from beneath the table and spread it out. \"Absorbent\nmaterial,\" he said. \"Lay it on that and just let it dry. That's what we\nused to do.\"\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"Next thing, I'll be changing its diapers!\"\n\n\"It isn't that bad,\" the Commissioner said. \"Anyway, you will adopt\nbaby, won't you?\"\n\n\"I suppose I have to.\" She placed the plasmoid on the towel, wiped her\nhands and stepped back from it. \"What happens if it falls on the floor?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Holati said. \"It just moves on in the direction it was going.\nPretty hard to hurt those things.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" Trigger said, \"let's check out its container now.\"\n\nThe Commissioner took Repulsive's container out of a desk safe and\nhanded it to her. Its outer appearance was that of a neat modern woman's\nhandbag with a shoulder strap. It had an antigrav setting which would\nreduce its overall weight, with the plasmoid inside, down to nine ounces\nif Trigger wanted it that way. It also had a combination lock, unmarked,\nvirtually invisible, the settings of which Trigger already had\nmemorized. Without knowing the settings, a determined man using a\nhigh-powered needle blaster might have opened the handbag in around nine\nhours. A very special job.\n\nTrigger ran through the settings, opened the container and peered\ninside. \"Rather cramped,\" she observed.\n\n\"Not for one of them. We needed room for the gadgetry.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Subspace rotation.\" She shook her head. \"Is that\nanother Space Scout invention?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Holati. \"They stole it from Subspace Engineers. Engineers\ndon't know we have it yet. Far as I know, nobody else has got it from\nthem. Go ahead--give it a try.\"\n\n\"I was going to.\" Trigger snapped the container shut, slipped the strap\nover her shoulder and stood straight, left hand closed over the lower\nrim of the purselike object. She shifted the ball of her thumb and the\ntip of her middle finger to the correct spots and began to apply\npressure. Then she started. Handbag and strap had vanished.\n\n\"Feels odd!\" She smiled. \"And to bring it back, I just have to be\nhere--the same place--and say those words.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Want to try that now?\"\n\nTrigger waved her left hand gently through the air beside her. \"What\nhappens,\" she asked, \"if the thing surfaces exactly where my hand\nhappens to be?\"\n\n\"It won't surface if there's anything bulkier than a few dust motes in\nthe way. That's one improvement the Sub Engineers haven't heard about\nyet.\"\n\n\"Well....\" She glanced around, picked up a plastic ruler from the desk\nbehind her, and moved back a cautious step. She waved the ruler's tip\ngingerly about in the area where the handbag had been.\n\n\"Come, Fido!\" she said.\n\nNothing happened. She drew the ruler back.\n\n\"Come, Fido!\"\n\nHandbag and strap materialized in mid-air and thumped to the floor.\n\n\"Convinced?\" Holati asked. He picked up the handbag and gave it back to\nher.\n\n\"It seems to work. How long will that little plasmoid last if it's left\nin subspace like that?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Indefinitely, probably. They're tough. We know that\ntwenty-four hours at a stretch won't bother it in the least, so we've\nset that as the limit it's to stay rotated except in emergencies.\"\n\n\"And you--and one other person I'm not to know about, but who isn't\nanywhere near here--can also bring it back?\"\n\n\"Yes. If we know the place from which it's been rotated. So the\nagreement is that--again except in absolute emergencies--it will be\nrotated only from one of the six points specified and known to all three\nof us.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. She opened the container and went over to the table\nwhere the plasmoid still lay on its towel. It was dry by now. She picked\nit up.\n\n\"You're a lot of trouble, Repulsive!\" she told it. \"But these people\nthink you must be worth it.\" She slipped it into the container, and it\nseemed to snuggle down comfortably inside. Trigger closed the handbag,\nlightened it to half its normal weight, slipped the strap back over her\nleft shoulder. \"And now,\" she inquired, \"what am I to do with the stuff\nI usually keep in a purse?\"\n\n\"You'll be in Precol uniform while you're here. We've had a special\nuniform made for you. Extra pockets.\"\n\nTrigger sighed.\n\n\"Oh, they're quite inconspicuous and convenient,\" he assured her. \"We\nchecked with the girls on that.\"\n\n\"I'll bet!\" she said. \"Did they okay the porgee pouch too?\"\n\n\"Sure. Porgee doping is a big thing all over the Hub at the moment.\nAmong the ladies anyway. Shows you're the delicate sort, or something\nlike that. I forget what they said. Want to start carrying it?\"\n\n\"Hand it over,\" Trigger said resignedly. \"I did see quite a few pouches\non the ship. Might as well get people used to thinking I've turned into\na porgee sniffer.\"\n\nHolati went back to the desk safe and took out a flat pouch, the length\nof his hand but narrower. He gave it to her. It appeared to be worked of\ngold thread; one side was studded with tiny pearls, the opposite surface\nwas plain. Trigger laid the plain side against the cloth of her skirt,\njust below the right hip, and let go. It adhered there. She stretched\nher right leg out to the side and considered the porgee pouch.\n\n\"Doesn't look too bad,\" she conceded. \"That's real porgee in the top\nsection?\"\n\n\"The real article. Close to nine hundred and fifty credits worth.\"\n\n\"Suppose somebody wants to borrow a sniff? Wouldn't be good to have them\nfumbling around the pouch very much!\"\n\n\"They can't,\" said the Commissioner. \"That's why we made it porgee. When\nyou buy a supply, it has to be adjusted to your individual chemistry,\nexactly. That's mainly what makes it expensive. Try using someone\nelse's, and it'll flip you across the room.\"\n\n\"Better get this adjusted to my chemistry then. I might have to take a\ndemonstration sniff now and then to make it look right.\"\n\n\"We've already done that,\" he said.\n\n\"Good,\" said Trigger. \"Now let's see!\" She straightened up, left hand\nclosed lightly around the bottom of the purse, right hand loose at her\nside. Her eyes searched the office briefly. \"Some object around here you\ndon't particularly value?\" she asked. \"Something largish?\"\n\n\"Several,\" the Commissioner said. He glanced around. \"That overgrown\nflower pot in the corner is one. Why?\"\n\n\"Just practicing,\" said Trigger. She turned to face the flower pot.\n\"That will do. Now--here I come along, thinking of nothing.\" She started\nwalking toward the flower pot. \"Then, suddenly, in front of me, there\nstands a plasmoid snatcher.\"\n\nShe stopped in mid-stride. Handbag and strap vanished, as her right hand\nslapped the porgee pouch. The Denton popped into her palm. The flower\npot screeched and flew apart.\n\n\"Golly!\" she said, startled. \"Come, Fido!\" Handbag and strap reappeared\nand she reached out and caught the strap. She looked around at\nCommissioner Tate.\n\n\"Sorry about your pot, Holati. I was just going to shake it up a little.\nI forgot you people had been handling my gun. I keep it switched to\nstunner myself when I'm carrying it,\" she added pointedly.\n\n\"Perfectly all right about the pot,\" the Commissioner said. \"I should\nhave warned you. Otherwise, I'd say all you'd need is a moment to see\nthem coming.\"\n\nTrigger spun the Denton to its stunner setting and laid it back inside\nthe slit which had appeared along the side of the porgee pouch. She ran\nthumb and finger tip along the length of the slit, and the pouch was\nsealed again.\n\n\"That's the part that's worrying me,\" she admitted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Trigger presented herself at Commissioner Tate's personal quarters\nearly that evening, she found him alone.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said. \"I've been trying to get hold of Mantelish for the\npast hour. He's over on the other side of the planet again.\"\n\nTrigger sat down and lifted an eyebrow. \"Should he be?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Holati. \"But I've been overruled on that. He's\nstill the best man the Federation has working on the various plasmoid\nproblems, so I'm not to interfere with his investigations any more than\nI can show is absolutely necessary. It's probably all right. Those\nU-League guards of his aren't a bad group.\"\n\n\"If they compare with the boys the League had watching the Plasmoid\nProject, they should be just about tops,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"The Space Scouts thank you for those kind words,\" the Commissioner told\nher. \"Those weren't League guards. When it came to deciding who was to\nkeep an eye on you, I overruled everybody.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I might have guessed it. What's there for the professor to\nbe investigating on the other side of Manon?\"\n\n\"He's hunting for some theoretical creatures he calls wild plasmoids.\"\n\n\"_Wild_ plasmoids?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. His idea is that some of the plasmoids the Old Galactics were\nusing on Manon might have got away from them, or just been left lying\naround, so to speak, and could have survived till now. He thinks they\nmight even be reproducing themselves. He's looking for them with a\nspecial detector he built.\"\n\nTrigger held up a finger on which was a slim gold ring with a small\ngreen stone in it. \"Like this one?\" she asked.\n\n\"He's got a large version of that type of detector with him too. But he\nthinks that if any wild plasmoids are around, they're likely to be along\nthe lines of 113-A. So he's also constructed a detector which reacts to\n113-A.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Trigger was silent a moment. \"Does Mantelish have any idea why\nRepulsive is the only plasmoid known to which our ring detectors don't\nreact?\"\n\n\"Apparently he does,\" Holati said. \"But when he starts in on those\nsubjects, I find him difficult to follow.\" He looked soberly at Trigger.\n\"There are times,\" he confessed, \"when I suspect Professor Mantelish is\nsomewhat daft. But probably he's just so brilliant that he keeps fading\nbeyond my mental range.\"\n\nTrigger laughed. \"My father used to come home from a session with\nMantelish muttering the same sort of thing.\" She glanced at the ring\nagain. \"By the way, have any plasmoids actually been stolen around here\nfor us to detect?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Quite a few have been snitched from Harvest Moon and various\nstorage points by now. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them turn up\nhere in the dome eventually. Not that it's a serious loss. What the\nthieves have been getting away with is small stuff--plasmoid nuts and\nbolts, so to speak. Still, each of those would still fetch around a\nhundred thousand credits, if you offered them to the right people.\nIncidentally, if asking you to this conference has interfered with any\npersonal plans, just say so. We can put it off till tomorrow. Especially\nsince it's beginning to look as if Mantelish won't make it here either.\"\n\n\"Either?\" Trigger said.\n\n\"Quillan's already had to cancel. He got involved with something during\nthe afternoon.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said coolly. She looked at her watch. \"I do have a dinner date\nwith Brule Inger in an hour and a half. But you said this meeting wasn't\nto take more than an hour anyway, didn't you?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Then I'm free. My quarters are arranged, and I'm ready to go back on my\nold job in the morning.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said the Commissioner. \"There are things I wanted to discuss\nwith you privately anyway. If we can't get through to Mantelish in\nanother ten minutes, we'll go ahead with that. I would have liked to\nhave Quillan here to fill us in with data about some of the top-level\ncrooks in the Hub. They're a specialty of his. I don't know too much\nabout them myself.\"\n\nHe paused. \"That Lyad Ermetyne now,\" he said, \"looks as if she either\nalready is part of the main problem or is working very hard to get\nthere. She's had a Tranest warship stationed here for the past two\nweeks. A thing called the Aurora.\"\n\nTrigger was startled. \"But warships aren't allowed in Manon System!\"\n\n\"It isn't in the system. It's stationed a half light-year away, where it\nhas a legal right to be. Nothing to worry about as such. It's just a\nheavy armed frigate, which is the limit Tranest is allowed to build.\nSince it's Lyad's private boat, I imagine it's been souped up with\neverything they could throw in. Anyway, the fact that she sent it here\nahead of her indicates she isn't just dropping in for a casual visit.\"\n\n\"She made that pretty clear herself!\" Trigger said. \"Why do you think\nshe's being so open about it?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Might have a number of reasons. One could be that she'd\nget the beady eye anyway as soon as she showed up here. When Lyad goes\nanywhere, it's usually on business. After Quillan reported on your\ndinner party, I got all the information I could on her. The First Lady\nstacks up as a tough cookie! Also smart. Most of those Ermetynes wind up\nbeing dead-brained by some loving relative, and apparently they have to\nknow how to whip up a sharp brew of poison before they're let into\nkindergarten. Lyad's been top dog among them since she was eighteen--\"\n\nHis head turned. A bell had begun pinging in the next room. He stood up.\n\n\"Probably Mantelish's outfit on the transmitter,\" he said. \"I told them\nto call as soon as they located him.\" He stopped at the door. \"Care for\na drink, Trigger girl? You know where the stuff is.\"\n\n\"Not just now, thanks.\"\n\nThe Commissioner came back in a couple of minutes. \"Darn fool got lost\nin a swamp! They found him finally, but he's too tired to come over\nnow.\"\n\nHe sat down and scratched his chin thoughtfully. \"Do you remember the\ntime you passed out on the Harvest Moon?\" he asked.\n\nTrigger looked at him, puzzled. \"The time I what?\"\n\n\"Passed out. Fainted. Went out cold.\"\n\n\"I? You're out of your mind, Holati! I never fainted in my life.\"\n\n\"Reason I asked,\" he said, \"is that I've been told a spell in a rest\ncubicle--same thing as a rest cubicle anyway, only it's used for\ntherapy--sometimes resolves amnesias.\"\n\n\"Amnesias! What _are_ you talking about?\"\n\nThe Commissioner said. \"I'm talking about you. This is bound to be a\njolt, Trigger girl. Might have been easier after a drink. But I'll just\ngive it to you straight. About a week after Mantelish and his U-League\ncrew first arrived here, you did pass out on one occasion while we were\non the Harvest Moon with them. And afterwards you didn't remember doing\nit.\"\n\n\"I didn't?\" Trigger said weakly.\n\n\"No. I thought it might have cleared up, and you just had some reason\nfor not wanting to mention it.\" He got to his feet. \"Like that drink\nnow--before I go on with the details?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nHolati Tate brought her the drink and went on with the details.\n\nTrigger and he and a dozen or so of the first group of U-League\ninvestigators had been in what was now designated as Section 52 of\nHarvest Moon. The Commissioner was by himself, checking over some\nequipment which had been installed in one of the compartments. After a\nwhile Doctor Azol joined him and told him Mantelish and the others had\ngone on to another section. Holati and Azol finished the check-up\ntogether and were about to leave the area to catch up with the group,\nwhen Holati saw Trigger lying on the floor in an adjoining compartment.\n\n\"You seemed to be in some kind of coma,\" he said. \"We picked you up and\nput you into a chair by one of the survey screens, and were trying to\nget out a call on Azol's suit communicator to the ambulance boat when\nyou suddenly opened your eyes. You looked at me and said, 'Oh, there you\nare! I was just going to go looking for you.'\"\n\n\"It was obvious that you didn't realize anything unusual had happened.\nAzol started to say something, but I stepped on his foot, and he caught\non. In fact, he caught on so fast that I became a little suspicious of\nhim.\"\n\n\"Poor Azol!\" Trigger said.\n\n\"Poor nothing!\" the Commissioner said cryptically. \"I'll tell you about\nthat some other time. I cautioned Doctor Azol to say nothing to anybody\nuntil the incident had been clarified, in view of the stringent security\nprecautions being practiced ... supposedly being practiced,\" he amended.\nThen he'd returned to Manon Planet with Trigger immediately, where she\nwas checked over by Precol's medical staff. Physically there wasn't a\nthing wrong with her.\n\n\"And that,\" said Trigger, feeling a little frightened, \"is something\nelse I don't remember!\"\n\n\"Well, you wouldn't,\" the Commissioner said. \"You were fed a hypno-spray\nfirst. You went out for three hours. When you woke up, you thought you'd\nbeen having a good nap. Since the medics were sure you hadn't picked up\nsome odd plasmoid infection, I wanted to know just what else had\nhappened on Harvest Moon. One of those scientific big shots might also\nhave used a hypno-spray on you, with the idea of turning you into a\nconditioned assistant for future shenanigans.\"\n\nTrigger grinned faintly. \"You do have a suspicious mind!\" The grin\nfaded. \"Was that what they were going to find out in that mind-search\ninterview on Maccadon I skipped out on?\"\n\n\"It's one of the things they might have looked for,\" he agreed.\n\nTrigger gazed at him very thoughtfully for a moment. \"Well, I loused\nthat deal up!\" she remarked. \"But why is everybody--\" She shook her\nhead. \"Excuse me. Go on.\"\n\nThe Commissioner went on. \"Old Doc Leeharvis was handling the hypnosis\nherself. She hit what she thought might be a mind-block when she tried\nto get you to remember what happened. We know now it wasn't a\nmind-block. But she wouldn't monkey with you any farther, and told me to\nget in an expert. So I called the Psychology Service's headquarters on\nOrado.\"\n\nTrigger looked startled, then laughed. \"The eggheads? You went right to\nthe top there, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Tried to,\" said Holati Tate. \"It's a good idea when you want real\nservice. They told me to stay calm and to say nothing to you. An expert\nwould be shipped out promptly.\"\n\n\"Was he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTrigger's eyes narrowed a little. \"Same old hypno-spray treatment?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Commissioner Tate. \"He came, sprayed, investigated. Then\nhe told me to stay calm, and went off looking puzzled.\"\n\n\"Puzzled?\" she said.\n\n\"If I hadn't known before that experts come in all grades,\" the\nCommissioner said, \"I'd know it now. That first one they sent was just\nsharp enough to realize there might be something involved in the case he\nwasn't getting. But that was all.\"\n\nTrigger was silent a moment. \"So there've been more of those\ninvestigations I don't know about!\" she observed, her voice taking on an\nedge.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" the Commissioner said cautiously.\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Seven.\"\n\nTrigger flushed, straightened up, eyes blazing, and pronounced a very\nunladylike word.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" she added a moment later. \"I got carried away.\"\n\n\"Perfectly all right,\" said the Commissioner.\n\n\"I've been getting just a bit fed up anyway,\" Trigger went on, voice and\ncolor still high, \"with people knocking me for a loop one way or another\nwhenever they happen to feel like it!\"\n\n\"Don't blame you a bit,\" he said.\n\n\"And please don't think I don't appreciate your calling in all those\nexperts. I do. It's just their sneaky, underhanded, secretive methods I\ndon't go for!\"\n\n\"Exactly how I feel about it,\" said the Commissioner.\n\nTrigger stared at him suspiciously. \"You're a pretty sneaky type\nyourself!\" she said. \"Well, excuse the blowup, Holati. They probably had\nsome reason for it. Have they found out anything at all with all the\nspraying and investigating?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. They seem to have made considerable progress. The last report\nI had from them--about a month ago--shows that the original amnesia has\nbeen completely resolved.\"\n\nTrigger looked surprised. \"If it's been resolved,\" she said reasonably,\n\"why don't I remember what happened?\"\n\n\"You aren't supposed to become conscious of it before the final\ninterview--I don't know the reason for that. But the memory is available\nnow. On tap, so to speak. They'll give you a cue, and then you'll\nremember it.\"\n\n\"Just like that, eh?\" She paused. \"So the Psychology Service is\nWhatzzit.\"\n\n\"Whatzzit?\" said the Commissioner.\n\nShe explained about Whatzzit. He grinned.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"They're the ones who've been giving the instructions,\nas far as you're concerned.\"\n\nTrigger was silent a moment. \"I've heard,\" she said, \"the eggheads have\nterrific pull when they want to use it. You don't hear much about them\notherwise. Let me think just a little.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Holati.\n\nA minute ticked away.\n\n\"What it boils down to so far,\" Trigger said then, \"is still pretty much\nwhat you told me on Maccadon. The Psychology Service thinks I know\nsomething that might help clean up the plasmoid problem. Or at least\nhelp explain it.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"And the people who've been trying to grab me very probably are doing it\nfor exactly the same reason.\"\n\nHe nodded again. \"That's almost certain.\"\n\n\"Do you think the eggheads might already have figured out what the\nconnection is?\"\n\nThe Commissioner shook his head. \"If they had, we'd be doing something\nabout it. The Federation Council is very nervous!\"\n\n\"Well....\" Trigger said. She pursed her lips. \"That Lyad....\" she said.\n\n\"What about her?\"\n\n\"She tried to hire me,\" said Trigger. \"Major Quillan reported it, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"And it wouldn't be just to steal some stupid plasmoid. Especially since\nyou say a number of small ones are already available. Then there're the\nones that raiders picked up in the Hub. She probably has a collection by\nnow.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Probably.\"\n\n\"She seems to know quite a bit about what's been going on....\"\n\n\"Very likely she does.\"\n\n\"Let's grab her!\" said Trigger. \"We can do it quietly. And she's too big\nto be mind-blocked. We'd get part of the answer. Perhaps all of it!\"\n\nSomething flared briefly in the Commissioner's small gray eyes. He\nreached over and patted her knee.\n\n\"You're a girl after my own heart, Trigger girl,\" he said. \"I'm for it.\nBut half the Council would have fainted dead away if they'd heard you\nmake that suggestion!\"\n\n\"They're as touchy as that?\" she asked, disappointed.\n\n\"Yes--and you can't quite blame them. Fumbles could be pretty bad. When\nit comes to someone around Lyad's level, our own group is restricted to\ndefensive counteraction. If we get evidence against her, it'll be up to\nthe diplomats to decide what's to be done about it. Tactfully. We\nwouldn't be further involved.\"\n\nTrigger nodded, watching him. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, defensive counteraction can cover a lot of things, of course. If\nwe actually run into the First Lady while we're engaged in it, we'll\nhold her--as long as we can. And from all accounts, now that she's\nshowed up to take personal charge of things around here, we can expect\nsome very fast, very direct action from Lyad.\"\n\n\"How fast?\"\n\n\"My own guess,\" said the Commissioner, \"would be around a week. If she\nhasn't moved by then, we might help things along a little.\"\n\n\"Make a few of those openings for her, eh? Well, that doesn't sound too\nbad.\" Trigger reflected. \"Then there's Point Number Two,\" she said.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nShe grimaced. \"I'm not real keen on it,\" she confessed, \"but I think\nwe'd better do something about that interview with Whatzzit I ducked out\nof. If they still want to talk to me--\"\n\n\"They do. Very much so.\"\n\n\"What's that business about their saying it was okay now for me to go on\nto Manon?\"\n\nCommissioner Tate tugged gently at his left ear lobe. \"Frankly,\" he\nsaid, \"that's something that shook me a little.\"\n\n\"Shook you? Why?\"\n\n\"It's that matter of experts coming in grades. The upper ranks in the\nPsychology Service are extremely busy people, I understand. After your\nfirst interview we were shifted upward promptly. A couple of middling\nhigh-bracket investigators took over for a while. But after the fourth\ninterview I was told I'd have to bring you to the Hub to let somebody\nreally competent handle the next stage of whatever they've been doing.\nThey said they couldn't spare anybody of that caliber for a trip to\nManon.\"\n\n\"Was _that_ the real reason we went to Maccadon?\" Trigger asked,\nstartled.\n\n\"Sure. But we still hadn't got anywhere near the Service's top level\nthen. As I get it, their topnotchers don't spend much time on individual\ncases. They keep busy with things on the scale of our more bothersome\nplanetary cultures--and there are supposed to be only a hundred or so of\nthem in that category. So I was more than a little surprised when the\nService informed me finally one of those people was coming to Maccadon\nto conduct your ninth interview.\"\n\n\"One of the real eggheads!\" Trigger smiled nervously. \"And then I just\ntook off! They can't have too good an opinion of me at the moment, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Apparently that didn't upset them in the least,\" the Commissioner\nsaid. \"They told me to stay calm and make sure you got to Manon all\nright. Then they said they had a ship operating in this area, and they'd\nroute it over to Manon after you arrived here.\"\n\n\"A ship?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"I've seen a few of their ships--they looked like oversized flying\nmountains. Camouflage jobs. What they actually are is spacegoing\nsuperlaboratories, from what I've heard. This one has a couple of those\ntopnotchers on board, and one of them will take you on. It's due here in\na day or so.\"\n\nTrigger had paled somewhat. \"You know,\" she said, \"I feel a little\nshaken myself now.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised,\" said the Commissioner.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Well if they're topnotchers, they must know what\nthey're doing.\" She gave him a smile. \"Looks like I'm something\nextremely unusual! Like a bothersome planetary culture.... Weak joke,\"\nshe added.\n\nThe Commissioner ignored the weak joke. \"There's another thing,\" he said\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"When I mentioned your reluctance about being interviewed, they told me\nnot to worry about it--that you wouldn't try to duck out again. That's\nwhy I was surprised when you brought up the matter of the interview\nyourself just now.\"\n\n\"Now that is odd,\" Trigger admitted after a pause. \"How would they\nknow?\"\n\n\"Right,\" he said. He sighed. \"Guess we're both a little out of our depth\nthere. I've come close to getting impatient with them a few times--had\nthe feeling they were stalling me off and holding back information. But\npresumably they do know what they're doing.\" He glanced at his watch.\n\"That hour's about up now, by the way.\"\n\n\"Well, if there's something else that should be discussed I can break my\ndinner date,\" Trigger said, somewhat reluctantly. \"I had a chance to\ntalk with Brule at the spaceport for a while, when we came in this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I wasn't suggesting that,\" said Holati. \"There still are things to be\ndiscussed, but a few hours one way or the other won't make any\ndifference. We'll get together again around lunch tomorrow. Then you'll\nbe filled in pretty well on all the main points of this business.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Fine.\"\n\n\"What I had in mind right now was that the Service people suggested\nhaving you look over their last report on you after your arrival. You'd\nhave just enough time for that before going to keep your date. Care to\ndo it?\"\n\n\"I certainly would!\" Trigger said.\n\nThe transmitter signaled for attention while she was studying the\nreport. Holati Tate went off to answer it. The report was rather\nlengthy, and Trigger was still going over it when he got back. He sat\ndown again and waited.\n\nWhen she looked up finally, he asked, \"Can you make much sense of it?\"\n\n\"Not very much,\" Trigger admitted. \"It just states what seems to have\nhappened. Not how or why. Apparently they did get me to develop a total\nrecall of that knocked-out period in the last interview--I even reported\nhearing you and Doctor Azol moving around and talking in the next\ncompartment.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I remember enough of my conversation with Azol to be able to\nverify that part of it.\"\n\n\"Then, some time before I actually fell down,\" said Trigger, \"I was\napparently already in that mysterious coma. Getting deeper into it. It\nstarted when I walked away from Mantelish's group, without having any\nparticular reason for doing it. I just walked. Then I was in another\ncompartment by myself and still walking, and the stuff kept getting\ndeeper, until I lost physical control of myself and fell down. Then I\nlay there a while until you came down that aisle and saw me. And after\nyou'd picked me up and put me in that chair--just like that, everything\nclears up! Except that I don't remember what happened and think I've\njust left Mantelish to go looking for you. I don't even wonder how I\nhappen to be sitting there in a chair!\"\n\nThe Commissioner smiled briefly. \"That's right. You didn't.\"\n\nHer slim fingers tapped the pages of the report, the green stone in the\nring he'd given her to wear reflecting little flashes of light. \"They\nseem quite positive that nobody else came near me during that period.\nAnd that nobody had used a hypno-spray on me or shot a hypodermic pellet\ninto me--anything like that--before the seizure or whatever it was came\non. How do you suppose they could be so sure of that?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" Holati said. \"But I think we might as well assume\nthey're right.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. What it seems to boil down to is they're saying I was\nundergoing something like a very much slowed-down, very profound\nemotional shock--source still undetermined, but profound enough to knock\nme completely out for a while. Only they also say that--for a whole list\nof reasons--it couldn't possibly have been an emotional shock after all!\nAnd when the effect left, it went instantaneously. That would be just\nthe reverse to the pattern of an emotional shock, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That occurred to me too, but it didn't explain anything\nto me. Possibly it's explained something to the Psychology Service.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said, \"it's certainly all very odd. Very disagreeable,\ntoo!\" She laid the report down on the arm of her chair and looked at the\nCommissioner. \"Guess I'd better run now,\" she said. \"But there was\nsomething you said before that made me wonder. There was really very\nlittle of Doctor Azol left after that plasmoid got through with him.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"True.\"\n\n\"It wasn't Azol, was it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Man, oh, man!\" Trigger jumped up, bent over his chair and gave him a\nquick peck on an ear tip. \"If I ask one more question, we'll be sitting\nhere the next two hours. I'll run instead! See you around lunchtime,\nCommissioner!\"\n\n\"Right, Trigger,\" he said, getting up.\n\nHe closed the door behind her and went back to the transmitter. He\nlooked rather unhappy.\n\n\"Yes?\" said a voice in the transmitter.\n\n\"She just left,\" Commissioner Tate said. \"Get on the beam and stay\nthere!\"\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said, regarding Brule critically, \"I just meant to say\nthat you're getting the least little bit plump here and there, under all\nthat tan. I'll admit it doesn't show yet when you're dressed.\"\n\nBrule smiled tolerantly. In silver swimming trunks and sandals, he was\nobviously a very handsome hunk of young man, and he knew it. So did\nTrigger. So did a quartet of predatory young females eyeing them\nspeculatively from a table only twenty feet away.\n\n\"I've come swimming here quite a bit since they opened the Center,\" he\nsaid. He flexed his right arm and regarded his biceps complacently.\n\"That's just streamlined muscle you're looking at, sweetheart!\"\n\nTrigger reached over and poked the biceps with a finger tip. \"Muscle?\"\nshe said, smiling at him. \"It dents. See?\"\n\nHe clasped his other hand over hers and squeezed it lightly.\n\n\"Oh, golly, Brule!\" she said happily. \"I'm so glad I'm back!\"\n\nHe gave her the smile. \"You're not the only glad one!\"\n\nShe looked around, humming softly. They were having dinner in one of the\nGrand Commerce Center's restaurants. This one happened to be beneath the\nsurface of the artificial swimming lake installed in the Center--a giant\ngrotto surrounded by green-gold chasms of water on every side.\nUnderwater swimmers and bottom walkers moved past beyond the wide\nwindows. A streak of silvery swiftness against a dark red canyon wall\nbefore her was trying to keep away from a trio of pursuing spear\nfishermen. Even the lake fish were Hub imports, advertised as such by\nthe Center.\n\nHer eyes widened suddenly. \"Hey!\" she said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That group of people up there!\"\n\nBrule looked. \"What about them?\"\n\n\"No suits, you idiot!\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Oh, a lot of them do that. Okay by Federation law, you\nknow. And seeing Manon's so close to becoming open Federation territory,\nwe haven't tried to enforce minor Precol regulations much lately.\"\n\n\"Well--\" Trigger began. He was still smiling. \"Have you been doing it?\"\nshe inquired suspiciously.\n\n\"Swimming in the raw? Certainly. Depends on the company. If you weren't\nsuch a little prude, I'd have suggested it tonight. Want to try it\nlater?\"\n\nTrigger colored. Prude again, she thought. \"Nope,\" she said. \"There are\nlimits.\"\n\nHe patted her cheek. \"On you it would look cute.\"\n\nShe shook her head, aware of a small fluster of guilt. There had been\nconsiderably less actual coverage in the Beldon costume than there was\nin the minute two-piece counterpart to Brule's silver trunks she wore at\nthe moment. She'd have to tell Brule about the Beldon stunt, since it\nwas more than likely he'd hear about it from others--Nelauk Pluly, for\none.\n\nBut not now. Things were getting just a little delicate along that line\nat the moment.\n\n\"Leave us change the subject, pig,\" she said cheerfully. \"Tell me what\nelse you've been doing besides acquiring a gorgeous tan.\"\n\nA couple of hours later, things began to get delicate again. Same\nsubject. Trigger had been somewhat startled at the spaceport when Brule\ntold her he had shifted his living quarters to a Center apartment, and\nthat a large number of Precol's executives were taking similar\nliberties. Holati's stand-in, Acting Commissioner Chelly, apparently\nhadn't been too successful at keeping up personnel discipline.\n\nShe hadn't said anything. It was true that Manon was still a precolonial\nplanet only as a technicality. They didn't know quite as much about it\nas they had to know before it could be officially released for\nunrestricted settling, but by now there was considerable excuse for\nloosening up on many of the early precautionary measures. For one thing,\nthere were just so many Hub people around nowadays that it would have\nbeen a practical impossibility to enforce all Precol rules.\n\nWhat bothered her mainly about the business of Brule's Center apartment\nwas that it might make the end of the evening less pleasant than she\nwanted it to be. Brule had become the least bit swacked. Not at all\noffensively, but he tended to get pretty ambitious then. And during the\npast few hours she'd noticed that something had changed in his attitude\ntoward her. He'd always been confident of himself when it came to women,\nso it wasn't that. It was perhaps, Trigger thought, like an unspoken\nultimatum along those lines. And she'd felt herself freezing up a little\nin response to the thought.\n\nThe apartment was very beautiful. Nelauk, she guessed. Or somebody else\nlike that. Brule's taste was good, but he simply wouldn't have thought\nof a lot of the details here. Neither, Trigger conceded, would she. Some\nof the details looked pretty expensive.\n\nHe came back into the living room in a dressing gown, carrying a couple\nof drinks. It was going to get awkward, all right.\n\n\"Like it?\" he asked, waving a hand around.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" Trigger said honestly. She smiled. She sipped at the\ndrink and placed it on the arm of her chair. \"Somebody like an interior\ndecorator help you with it?\"\n\nBrule laughed and sat down opposite her with his drink. The laugh had\nsounded the least bit annoyed. \"You're right,\" he said. \"How did you\nguess?\"\n\n\"You never went in for art exactly,\" she said. \"This room is a work of\nart.\"\n\nHe nodded. He didn't look annoyed any more. He looked smug. \"It is,\nisn't it?\" he said. \"It didn't even cost so very much. You just have to\nknow how, that's all.\"\n\n\"Know how about what?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Know how to live,\" Brule said. \"Know what it's all about. Then it's\neasy.\"\n\nHe was looking at her. The smile was there. The warm, rich voice was\nthere. All the old charm was there. It was Brule. And it wasn't. Trigger\nrealized she was twisting her hands together. She looked down at them.\nThe little jewel in the ring Holati Tate had given her to wear blinked\nback with crimson gleamings.\n\nCrimson!\n\nShe drew a long, slow breath.\n\n\"Brule,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Brule. At the edge of her vision she saw the smile turn\neager.\n\nTrigger said, \"Give me the plasmoid.\" She raised her eyes and looked at\nhim. He'd stopped smiling.\n\nBrule looked back at her a long time. At least it seemed a long time to\nTrigger. The smile suddenly returned.\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" he asked, almost plaintively. \"If it's\na joke, I don't get it.\"\n\n\"I just said,\" Trigger repeated carefully, \"give me the plasmoid. The\none you stole.\"\n\nBrule took a swallow of his drink and put the glass down on the floor.\n\"Aren't you feeling well?\" he asked solicitously.\n\n\"Give me the plasmoid.\"\n\n\"Honestly, Trigger.\" He shook his head. He laughed. \"What _are_ you\ntalking about?\"\n\n\"A plasmoid. The one you took. The one you've got here.\"\n\nBrule stood up. He studied her face, blinking, puzzled. Then he laughed,\nrichly. \"Trigger, I've fed you one drink too many! I never thought you'd\nlet me do it. Be sensible now--if I had a plasmoid here, how could you\ntell?\"\n\n\"I can tell. Brule, I don't know how you took it or why you took it. I\ndon't really care.\" And that was a lie, Trigger thought dismally. She\ncared. \"Just give it to me, and I'll put it back. We can talk about it\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Afterwards,\" Brule said. The laugh came again, but it sounded a little\nhollow. He moved a step toward her, stopped again, hands on his hips.\n\"Trigger,\" he said soberly, \"if I've ever done anything you mightn't\napprove of, it was done for both of us. You realize that, don't you?\"\n\n\"I think I do,\" Trigger said warily. \"Yes. Give it to me, Brule.\"\n\nBrule leaped forward. She slid sideways out of the chair to the floor as\nhe leaped. She was crying inside, she realized vaguely. Brule was going\nto kill her now, if he could.\n\nShe caught his left foot with both hands as he came down, and twisted\nviciously.\n\nBrule shouted something. His red, furious face swept by above. He\nthumped to the floor beside her, one leg flung across her thighs,\ngripping.\n\nIn colonial school Brule had received the same basic training in unarmed\ncombat that Trigger had. He was close to eighty pounds heavier than\nTrigger, and it was still mostly muscle. But it was nearly four years\nnow since he had bothered himself with drills.\n\nAnd he hadn't been put through Mihul's advanced students' courses\nlately.\n\nHe stayed conscious a little less than nine seconds.\n\nThe plasmoids were in a small electronic safe built into a music\ncabinet. The stamp to the safe was in Brule's billfold.\n\nThere were three of them, about the size of mice, starfish-shaped lumps\nof translucent, hard, colorless jelly. They didn't move.\n\nTrigger laid them in a row on the polished surface of a small table, and\nblinked at them for a moment from a streaming left eye. The right eye\nwas swelling shut. Brule had got in one wild wallop somewhere along the\nline. She picked up a small jar, emptied some spicy-smelling, crumbly\ncontents out on the table, dropped the plasmoids inside, closed the jar\nand left the apartment with it. Brule was just beginning to stir and\ngroan.\n\nCommissioner Tate hadn't retired yet. He let her in without a word.\nTrigger put the jar down on a table.\n\n\"Three of your nuts and bolts in there,\" she said.\n\nHe nodded. \"I know.\"\n\n\"I thought you did,\" said Trigger. \"Thanks for the quick cure. But right\nat the moment I don't like you very much, Holati. We can talk about that\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Commissioner. He hesitated. \"Anything that should\nbe taken care of before then?\"\n\n\"It's been taken care of,\" Trigger said. \"One of our employees has been\nmoderately injured. I dialed the medics to go pick him up. They have.\nGood night.\"\n\n\"You might let me do something for that eye,\" he said.\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"I've got stuff in my quarters.\"\n\nShe locked herself into her quarters, got out a jar of quick-heal and\nanointed the eye and a few other minor bruises. She put the jar away,\nmade a mechanical check of the newly installed anti-intrusion devices,\ndimmed the lights and climbed into her bunk. For the next twenty minutes\nshe wept violently. Then she fell asleep.\n\nAn hour or so later, she turned over on her side and said without\nopening her eyes, \"Come, Fido!\"\n\nThe plasmoid purse appeared just above the surface of the bunk between\nTrigger's pillow and the wall. It dropped with a small thump and stood\nbalanced uncertainly. Trigger slept on.\n\nFive minutes after that, the purse opened itself. A little later again,\nTrigger suddenly shifted her shoulder uneasily, frowned and made a\nlittle half-angry, half-whimpering cry. Then her face smoothed out. Her\nbreathing grew quiet and slow.\n\nMajor Heslet Quillan of the Subspace Engineers came breezing into Manon\nPlanet's spaceport very early in the morning. A Precol aircar picked him\nup and let him out on a platform of the Headquarters dome near\nCommissioner Tate's offices. Quillan was handed on toward the offices\nthrough a string of underlings and reached the door just as it opened\nand Trigger Argee stepped through.\n\nHe grasped her cordially by the shoulders and cried out a cheery hello.\nTrigger made a soft growling sound in her throat. Her left hand chopped\nright, her right hand chopped left. Quillan grunted and let go.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he inquired, stepping back. He rubbed one arm, then\nthe other.\n\nTrigger looked at him, growled again, walked past him, and disappeared\nthrough another door, her back very straight.\n\n\"Come in, Quillan,\" Commissioner Tate said from within the office.\n\nQuillan went in and closed the door behind him. \"What did I do?\" he\nasked bewilderedly.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" said Holati. \"You just share the misfortune of being a\nmale human being. At the moment, Trigger's against 'em. She blew up the\nBrule Inger setup last night.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Quillan sat down. \"I never did like that idea much,\" he said.\n\nThe Commissioner shrugged. \"You don't know the girl yet. If I'd hauled\nInger in, she would never have really forgiven me for it. I had to let\nher handle it herself. Actually she understands that.\"\n\n\"How did it go?\"\n\n\"Her cover reported it was one hell of a good fight for some seconds. If\nyou'd looked closer, you might have just spotted the traces of the\nshiner Inger gave her. It was a beaut last night.\"\n\nQuillan went white.\n\n\"But if you're thinking of having a chat with Inger re that part of it,\"\nthe Commissioner went on, \"forget it.\" He glanced at a report from the\nmedical department on his desk. \"Dislocated shoulder ... broken thumb\n... moderate concussion. And so on. It was the throat punch that\nfinished the matter. He can't talk yet. We'll call it square.\"\n\nQuillan grunted. \"What are you going to do with him now?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Holati said. \"We know his contacts. Why bother? He'll resign\nend of the month.\"\n\nQuillan cleared his throat and glanced at the door. \"I suppose she'll\nwant him put up for rehabilitation--seemed pretty fond of him.\"\n\n\"Relax, son,\" said the Commissioner. \"Trigger's an individualist. If\nInger goes up for rehabilitation, it will be because he wants it. And he\ndoesn't, of course. Being a slob suits him fine. He's just likely to be\nmore cautious about it in future. So we'll let him go his happy way.\nNow--let's get down to business. How does Pluly's yacht harem stack up?\"\n\nA reminiscent smile spread slowly over Quillan's face. He shook his\nhead. \"Awesome, brother!\" he said. \"Plain awesome!\"\n\n\"Pick up anything useful?\"\n\n\"Nothing definite. But whenever Belchy comes out of the esthetic\ntrances, he's a worried man. Count him in.\"\n\n\"For sure?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"All right. He's in. Crack the Aurora yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Quillan. \"The girls are working on it. But the Ermetyne keeps\na mighty taut ship and a mighty disciplined crew. We'll have a couple of\nthose boys wrapped up in another week. No earlier.\"\n\n\"A week might be soon enough,\" said the Commissioner. \"It also might\nnot.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Quillan. \"But the Aurora does look a little bit\nobvious, doesn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Holati Tate admitted. \"Just a little bit.\"\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nBy lunchtime, Trigger was acting almost cordial again. \"I've got the\nPrecol job lined up,\" she reported to Holati Tate. \"I'll handle it like\nI used to, whenever I can. When I can't, the kids will shift in\nautomatically.\" The kids were the five assistants among whom her duties\nhad been divided in her absence.\n\n\"Major Quillan called me up to Mantelish's lab around ten,\" she went on.\n\"They wanted to see Repulsive, so I took him up there. Then it turned\nout Mantelish wanted to take Repulsive along on a field trip this\nafternoon.\"\n\nHolati looked startled. \"He can't do that, and he knows it!\" He reached\nfor the desk transmitter.\n\n\"Don't bother, Commissioner. I told Mantelish I'd been put in charge of\nRepulsive, and that he'd lose an arm if he tried to walk out of the lab\nwith him.\"\n\nHolati cleared his throat. \"I see! How did Mantelish react?\"\n\n\"Oh, he huffed a bit. Like he does. Then he calmed down and agreed he\ncould get by without Repulsive out there. So we stood by while he\nmeasured and weighed the thing, and so on. After that he got friendly\nand said you'd asked him to fill me in on current plasmoid theory.\"\n\n\"So I did,\" said Holati. \"Did he?\"\n\n\"He tried, I think. But it's like you say. I got lost in about three\nsentences and never caught up.\" She looked curiously at the\nCommissioner. \"I didn't have a chance to talk to Major Quillan alone, so\nI'm wondering why Mantelish was told the I-Fleets in the Vishni area are\nhunting for planets with plasmoids on them. I thought you felt he was\ntoo woolly-minded to be trusted.\"\n\n\"We couldn't keep that from him very well,\" Holati said. \"He was the boy\nwho thought of it.\"\n\n\"You didn't have to tell him they'd found some possibles did you?\"\n\n\"He did, unfortunately. He's had those plasmoid detectors of his for\nabout a month, but he didn't happen to think of mentioning them. The\nreason he was to come back to Manon originally was to sort over the\nstuff the Fleets have been sending back here. It's as weird a collection\nof low-grade life-forms as I've ever seen, but not plasmoid. Mantelish\nwent into a temper and wanted to know why the idiots weren't using\ndetectors.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" Trigger said.\n\n\"That's what it's like when you're working with him,\" said the\nCommissioner. \"We started making up detectors wholesale and rushing them\nout there, but the new results haven't come in yet.\"\n\n\"Well, that explains it.\" Trigger looked down at the desk a moment, then\nglanced up and met the Commissioner's eye. She colored slightly.\n\n\"Incidentally,\" she said, \"I did take the opportunity to apologize to\nMajor Quillan for clipping him a couple this morning. I shouldn't have\ndone that.\"\n\n\"He didn't seem offended,\" said Holati.\n\n\"No, not really,\" she agreed.\n\n\"And I explained to him that you had a very good reason to feel\ndisturbed.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Trigger. \"By the way, was he really a smuggler at one\ntime? And a hijacker?\"\n\n\"Yes--very successful at it. It's excellent cover for some phases of\nIntelligence work. As I heard it, though, Quillan happened to scramble\nup one of the Hub's nastier dope rings in the process, and was broken\ntwo grades in rank.\"\n\n\"Broken?\" Trigger said. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Unwarranted interference with a political situation. The Scouts are\nrough about that. You're supposed to see those things. Sometimes you\ndon't. Sometimes you do and go ahead anyway. They may pat you on the\nback privately, but they also give you the axe.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she said. She smiled.\n\n\"Just how far did we get in bringing you up to date yesterday?\" the\nCommissioner asked.\n\n\"The remains that weren't Doctor Azol,\" Trigger said.\n\nIf it hadn't been for the funny business with Trigger, Holati said, he\nmightn't have been immediately skeptical about Doctor Azol's supposed\ndemise by plasmoid during a thrombosis-induced spell of unconsciousness.\nThere had been no previous indications that the U-League's screening of\nits scientists, in connection with the plasmoid find, might have been\nstrategically loused up from the start.\n\nBut as things stood, he did look on the event with very considerable\nskepticism. Doctor Azol's death, in that particular form, seemed too\nmuch of a coincidence. For, beside himself, only Azol knew that another\nperson already had suddenly and mysteriously lost consciousness on\nHarvest Moon. Only Azol therefore might expect that the Commissioner\nwould quietly inform the official investigators of the preceding\nincident, thus cinching the accidental death theory in Azol's case much\nmore neatly than the assumed heart attack had done.\n\nThe Commissioner went on from there to the reflection that if Azol had\nchosen to disappear, it might well have been with the intention of\nconveying important information secretly back to somebody waiting for it\nin the Hub. He saw to it that the remains were preserved, and that word\nof what could have happened was passed on to a high Federation official\nwhom he knew to be trustworthy. That was all he was in a position to do,\nor interested in doing, himself. Security men presently came and took\nthe supposed vestiges of Doctor Azol's body back to the Hub.\n\n\"It wasn't until some months later, when the works blew up and I was put\non this job, that I heard any more about it,\" Holati Tate said. \"It\nwasn't Azol. It was part of some unidentifiable cadaver which he'd\npresumably brought with him for just such a use. Anyway, they had Azol's\ngene patterns on record, and they didn't jibe.\"\n\nHis desk transmitter buzzed and Trigger took it on an earphone\nextension.\n\n\"Argee,\" she said. She listened a moment. \"All right. Coming over.\" She\nstood up, replacing the earphone. \"Office tangle,\" she explained. \"Guess\nthey feel I'm fluffing, now I'm back. I'll get back here as soon as it's\nstraightened out. Oh, by the way.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"The Psychology Service ship messaged in during the morning. It'll\narrive some time tomorrow and wants a station assigned to it outside the\nsystem, where it won't be likely to attract attention. Are they really\nas huge as all that?\"\n\n\"I've seen one or two that were bigger,\" the Commissioner said. \"But not\nmuch.\"\n\n\"When they're stationed, they'll send someone over in a shuttle to pick\nme up.\"\n\nThe Commissioner nodded. \"I'll check on the arrangements for that. The\nidea of the interview still bothering you?\"\n\n\"Well, I'd sooner it wasn't necessary,\" Trigger admitted. \"But I guess\nit is.\" She grinned briefly. \"Anyway, I'll be able to tell my\ngrandchildren some day that I once talked to one of the real egg\nheads!\"\n\nThe Psychology Service woman who stood up from a couch as Trigger came\ninto the small spaceport lounge next evening looked startlingly similar\nto Major Quillan's Dawn City assistant, Gaya. Standing, you could see\nthat she was considerably more slender than Gaya. She had all of Gaya's\ngood looks.\n\n\"The name is Pilch,\" she said. She looked at Trigger and smiled. It was\na good smile, Trigger thought; not the professional job she'd expected.\n\"And everyone who knows Gaya,\" she went on, \"thinks we must be twins.\"\n\nTrigger laughed. \"Aren't you?\"\n\n\"Just first cousins.\" The voice was all right too--clear and easy.\nTrigger felt herself relax somewhat. \"That's one reason they picked me\nto come and get you. We're already almost acquainted. Another is that\nI've been assigned to take you through the preliminary work for your\ninterview after we get to the ship. We can chat a bit on the way, and\nthat should make it seem less disagreeable. Boat's in the speedboat park\nover there.\"\n\nThey started down a short hallway to the park area. \"Just how\ndisagreeable is it going to be?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Not at all bad in your case. You're conditioned to the processes more\nthan you know. Your interviewer will just pick up where the last job\nended and go on from there. It's when you have to work down through\nbarriers that you have a little trouble.\"\n\nTrigger was still mulling that over as she stepped ahead of Pilch into\nthe smaller of two needle-nosed craft parked side by side. Pilch\nfollowed her in and closed the lock behind them. \"The other one's a\ncombat job,\" she remarked. \"Our escort. Commissioner Tate made very sure\nwe had one, too!\" She motioned Trigger to a low soft seat that took up\nhalf the space of the tiny room behind the lock, sat down beside her and\nspoke at a wall pickup. \"All set. Let's ride!\"\n\nBlue-green tinted sky moved past them in the little room's viewer\nscreen; then a tilted landscape flashed by and dropped back. Pilch\nwinked at Trigger. \"Takes off like a scared yazong, that boy! He'll race\nthe combat job to the ship. About those barriers. Supposing I told you\nsomething like this. There's no significant privacy invasion in this\nline of work. We go directly to the specific information we're looking\nfor and deal only with that. Your private life, your personal thoughts,\nremain secret, sacred and inviolate. What would you say?\"\n\n\"I'd say you're a liar,\" Trigger said promptly.\n\n\"Of course. That sort of thing is sometimes told to nervous\ninterviewees. We don't bother with it. But now supposing I told you very\nsincerely that no recording will be made of any little personal glimpses\nwe may get?\"\n\n\"Lying again.\"\n\n\"Right again,\" said Pilch. \"You've been scanned about as thoroughly as\nanyone ever gets to be outside of a total therapy. Your personal\nsecrets are already on record, and since I'm doing most of the\npreparatory work with you, I've studied all the significant-looking ones\nvery closely. You're a pretty good person, for my money. All right?\"\n\nTrigger studied her face uncomfortably. Hardly all right, but....\n\n\"I guess I can stand it,\" she said. \"As far as you're concerned,\nanyway.\" She hesitated. \"What's the egghead like?\"\n\n\"Old Cranadon?\" said Pilch. \"You won't mind her a bit, I think. Very\nmotherly old type. Let's get through the preparations first, and then\nI'll introduce you to her. If you think it would make you more\ncomfortable, I'll just stay around while she's working. I've sat in on\nher interviews before. How's that?\"\n\n\"Sounds better,\" Trigger said. She did feel a good deal relieved.\n\nThey slid presently into a tunnel-like lock of the space vehicle Holati\nTate had described as a flying mountain. From what Trigger could see of\nit in the guide lights on the approach, it did rather closely resemble a\nvery large mountain of the craggier sort. They went through a series of\nlifts, portals and passages, and wound up in a small and softly lit room\nwith a small desk, a very large couch, a huge wall-screen, and assorted\ngadgetry. Pilch sat down at the desk and invited Trigger to make herself\ncomfortable on the couch.\n\nTrigger lay down on the couch. She had a very brief sensation of falling\ngently through dimness.\n\nHalf an hour later she sat up on the couch. Pilch switched on a desk\nlight and looked at her thoughtfully. Trigger blinked. Then her eyes\nwidened, first with surprise, then in comprehension.\n\n\"Liar!\" she said.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Pilch. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"That _was_ the interview!\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"Then you're the egghead!\"\n\n\"Tcha!\" said Pilch. \"Well, I believe I can modestly describe myself as\nbeing like that. Yes. You're another, by the way. We're just smart about\ndifferent things. Not so very different.\"\n\n\"You were smart about this,\" Trigger said. She swung her legs off the\ncouch and regarded Pilch dubiously. Pilch grinned.\n\n\"Took most of the disagreeableness out of it, didn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Trigger admitted, \"it did. Now what do we do?\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Pilch, \"I'll explain.\"\n\nThe thing that had caught their attention was a quite simple process. It\njust happened to be a process the Psychology Service hadn't observed\nunder those particular circumstances before.\n\n\"Here's what our investigators had the last time,\" Pilch said. \"Lines\nand lines of stuff, of course. But here's a simple continuity which\nmakes it clear. Your mother dies when you're six months old. Then there\nare a few nurses whom you don't like very much. Good nurses but frankly\nmuch too stupid for you, though you don't know that, and they don't\neither, naturally. Next, you're seven years old--a bit over--and\nthere's a mud pond on the farm near Ceyce where you spend all your\nvacations. You just love that old mud pond.\"\n\nTrigger laughed. \"A smelly old hole, actually! Full of froggy sorts of\nthings. I went out to that farm six years ago, just to look around it\nagain. But you're right. I did love that mud pond, once.\"\n\n\"Right up to that seventh summer,\" Pilch said. \"Which was the summer\nyour father's cousin spent her vacation on the farm with you.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Perhaps. I don't remember the time too well.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Pilch said, \"she was a brilliant woman. In some ways. She was\nabout the age your mother had been when she died. She was very\ngood-looking. And she was _nice_! She played games with a little girl,\nsang to her. Told her stories. Cuddled her.\"\n\nTrigger blinked. \"Did she? I don't--\"\n\n\"However,\" said Pilch, \"she did not play games with, tell stories to,\ncuddle, etcetera, little girls who\"--her voice went suddenly thin and\nedged--\"_come in all filthy and smelling from that dirty, slimy old mud\npond!_\"\n\nTrigger looked startled. \"You know,\" she said, \"I do believe I remember\nher saying that--just that way!\"\n\n\"You remember it,\" said Pilch, \"now. You never saw her again after that\nsummer. Your father had good sense. He didn't marry her, as he\napparently intended to do before he saw how she was going to be with\nyou. You went back to your old mud pond just once more, on your next\nvacation. She wasn't there. What had you done? You waded around,\nfeeling pretty sad. And you stepped on a sharp stick and cut your foot\nbadly. Sort of a self-punishment.\"\n\nShe flipped over a few pages of some record on her desk. \"Now before you\nstart asking what's interesting about that, I'll run over a few\ncrossed-in items. Age twelve. There's that Maccadon animal like a\ndryland jellyfish--a mingo, isn't it?--that swallowed your kitten.\"\n\n\"The mingo!\" Trigger said. \"I remember that. I killed it.\"\n\n\"Right. You kicked it apart and pulled out the kitten, but the kitten\nwas dead and partly digested. You bawled all day and half the night\nabout that.\"\n\n\"I might have, I suppose.\"\n\n\"You did. Now those are two centering points. There's other stuff\nconnected with them. No need to go into details. As classes--you've\nstepped now and then on things that squirmed or squashed. Bad smells.\nEtcetera. How do you feel about plasmoids?\"\n\nTrigger wrinkled her nose. \"I just think they're unpleasant things. All\nexcept--\"\n\nOops! She checked herself.\n\n\"--Repulsive,\" said Pilch. \"It's quite all right about Repulsive. We've\nbeen informed of that supersecret little item you're guarding. If we\nhadn't been told, we'd know now, of course. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Well, it's odd!\" Trigger remarked thoughtfully. \"I just said I thought\nplasmoids were rather unpleasant. But that's the way I used to feel\nabout them. I don't feel that way now.\"\n\n\"Except again,\" said Pilch, \"for that little monstrosity on the ship. If\nit was a plasmoid. You rather suspect it was, don't you?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"That would be pretty bad!\"\n\n\"Very bad,\" said Pilch. \"Plasmoids generally, you feel about them now as\nyou feel about potatoes ... rocks ... neutral things like that?\"\n\n\"That's about it,\" Trigger said. She still looked puzzled.\n\n\"We'll go over what seems to have changed your attitude there in a\nminute or so. Here's another thing--\" Pilch paused a moment, then said,\n\"Night before last, about an hour after you'd gone to bed, you had a\nvery light touch of the same pattern of mental blankness you experienced\non that plasmoid station.\"\n\n\"While I was asleep?\" Trigger said, startled.\n\n\"That's right. Comparatively very light, very brief. Five or six\nminutes. Dream activity, etcetera, smooths out. Some blocking on various\nsense lines. Then, normal sleep until about five minutes before you woke\nup. At that point there may have been another minute touch of the same\npattern. Too brief to be actually definable. A few seconds at most. The\npoint is that this is a continuing process.\"\n\nShe looked at Trigger a moment. \"Not particularly alarmed, are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Trigger. \"It just seems very odd.\" She added, \"I got rather\nfrightened when Commissioner Tate was first telling me what had been\ngoing on.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\"\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nPilch was silent for some moments again, considering the wall-screen as\nif thinking about something connected with it. \"Well, we'll drop that\nfor now,\" she said finally. \"Let me tell you what's been happening these\nmonths, starting with that first amnesia-covered blankout on Harvest\nMoon. The Maccadon Colonial School has sound basic psychology courses,\nso there won't be much explaining to do. The connection between those\nincidents I mentioned and your earlier feeling of disliking plasmoids is\nobvious, isn't it?\"\n\nTrigger nodded.\n\n\"Good. When you got the first Service check-up at Commissioner Tate's\ndemand, there was very little to go on. The amnesia didn't lift\nimmediately--not very unusual. The blankout might be interesting\nbecause of the circumstances. Otherwise the check showed you were in a\ngood deal better than normal condition. Outside of total therapy\nprocesses--and I believe you know that's a long haul--there wasn't much\nto be done for you, and no particular reason to do it. So an\namnesia-resolving process was initiated and you were left alone for a\nwhile.\n\n\"Actually something already was going on at the time, but it wasn't\nspotted until your next check. What it's amounted to has been a\nrelatively minor but extremely precise and apparently purposeful therapy\nprocess. Your unconscious memories of those groupings of incidents I was\ntalking about, along with various linked groupings, have gradually been\ncleared up. Emotion has been drained away, fixed evaluations have faded.\nAssociative lines have shifted.\n\n\"Now that's nothing remarkable in itself. Any good therapist could have\ndone the same for you, and much more rapidly. Say in a few hours' hard\nwork, spread over several weeks to permit progressive assimilation\nwithout conscious disturbances. The _very_ interesting thing is that this\norderly little process appears to have been going on all by itself. And\nthat just doesn't happen. You disturbed now?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"A little. Mainly I'm wondering why somebody wants me to\nnot-dislike plasmoids.\"\n\n\"So am I wondering,\" said Pilch. \"Somebody does, obviously. And a very\nslick somebody it is. We'll find out by and by. Incidentally, this\nparticular part of the business has been concluded. Apparently,\nsomebody doesn't intend to make you wild for plasmoids. It's enough that\nyou don't dislike them.\"\n\nTrigger smiled. \"I can't see anyone making me wild for the things,\nwhatever they tried!\"\n\nPilch nodded. \"Could be done,\" she said. \"Rather easily. You'd be bats,\nof course. But that's very different from a simple neutralizing process\nlike the one we've been discussing.... Now here's something else. You\nwere pretty unhappy about this business for a while. That wasn't\nsomebody's fault. That was us. I'll explain.\n\n\"Your investigators could have interfered with the little therapy\nprocess in a number of ways. That wouldn't have taught them a thing, so\nthey didn't. But on your third check they found something else. Again it\nwasn't in the least obtrusive; in someone else they mightn't have given\nit a second look. But it didn't fit at all with your major personality\npatterns. You wanted to stay where you were.\"\n\n\"Stay where I was?\"\n\n\"In the Manon System.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Trigger flushed a little. \"Well--\"\n\n\"I know. Let's go on a moment. We had this inharmonious inclination. So\nwe told Commissioner Tate to bring you to the Hub and keep you there, to\nsee what would happen. And on Maccadon, in just a few weeks, you'd begun\nworking that moderate inclination to be back in the Manon System up to a\ndandy first-rate compulsion.\"\n\nTrigger licked her lips. \"I--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Pilch. \"You had to have a good sensible reason. You gave\nyourself one.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Oh, you were fond of that young man, all right. Who wouldn't be?\nWonderful-looking lug. I'd go for him myself--till I got him on that\ncouch, that is. But that was the first time you hadn't been able to\nstand a couple of months away from him. It was also the first time you'd\nstarted worrying about competition. You now had your justification. And\nwe,\" Pilch said darkly, \"had a fine, solid compulsion with no doubt very\nrevealing ramifications to it to work on. Just one thing went wrong with\nthat, Trigger. You don't have the compulsion any more.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"You don't even,\" said Pilch, \"have the original moderate inclination.\nNow one might have some suspicions there! But we'll let them ride for\nthe moment.\"\n\nShe did something on the desk. The huge wall-screen suddenly lit up. A\nsoft, amber-glowing plane of blankness, with a suggestion of receding\ndepths within it.\n\n\"Last night, shortly before you woke up,\" Pilch said, \"you had a dream.\nActually you had a series of eight dreams during the night which seem\npertinent here. But the earlier ones were rather vague preliminary\nstructures. In one way and another, their content is included in this\nfinal symbol grouping. Let's see what we can make of them.\"\n\nA shape appeared on the screen.\n\nTrigger started, then laughed.\n\n\"What do you think of it?\" Pilch asked.\n\n\"A little green man!\" she said. \"Well, it could be a sort of counterpart\nto the little yellow thing on the ship, couldn't it? The good little\ndwarf and the very bad little dwarf.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" said Pilch. \"How do you feel about the notion?\"\n\n\"Good plasmoids and bad plasmoids?\" Trigger shook her head. \"No. It\ndoesn't feel right.\"\n\n\"What else feels right?\" Pilch asked.\n\n\"The farmer. The little old man who owned the farm where the mud pond\nwas.\"\n\n\"Liked him, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Very much! He knew a lot of fascinating things.\" She laughed again.\n\"You know, I'd hate to have him find out--but that little green man also\nreminds me quite a bit of Commissioner Tate.\"\n\n\"I don't think he'd mind hearing it,\" Pilch said. She paused a moment.\n\"All right--what's this?\"\n\nA second shape appeared.\n\n\"A sort of caricature of a wild, mean horse,\" Trigger said. She added\nthoughtfully, \"there was a horse like that on that farm, too. I suppose\nyou know that?\"\n\n\"Yes. Any thoughts about it?\"\n\n\"No-o-o. Well, one. The little farmer was the only one who could handle\nthat horse. It was mutated horse, actually--one of the Life Bank deals\nthat didn't work out so well. Enormously strong. It could work\nforty-eight hours at a stretch without even noticing it. But it was just\na plain mean animal.\"\n\n\"'Crazy-mean,'\" observed Pilch, \"was the dream feeling about it.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"I remember I used to think it was crazy for that horse\nto want to go around kicking and biting things to pieces. Which was\nabout all it really wanted to do. I imagine it was crazy, at that.\"\n\n\"You weren't ever in any danger from it yourself, were you?\"\n\nTrigger laughed. \"I couldn't have got anywhere near it! You should have\nseen the kind of place the old farmer kept it when it wasn't working.\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Pilch. \"Long, wide, straight-walled pit in the ground.\nCover for shade, plenty of food, running water. He was a good farmer.\nVery high locked fence around it to keep little girls and anyone else\nfrom getting too close to his useful monster.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Trigger. She shook her head. \"When you people look into\nsomebody's mind, you look!\"\n\n\"We work at it,\" Pilch said. \"Let's see what you can do with this one.\"\n\nTrigger was silent for almost a minute before she said in a subdued\nvoice, \"I just get what it shows. It doesn't seem to mean anything?\"\n\n\"What does it show?\"\n\n\"Laughing giants stamping on a farm. A tiny sort of farm. It looks like\nit might be the little green man's farm. No, wait. It's not his! But it\nbelongs to other little green people.\"\n\n\"How do you feel about that?\"\n\n\"Well--I hate those giants!\" Trigger said. \"They're cruel. And they\nlaugh about being cruel.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of them?\"\n\nTrigger blinked at the screen for a few seconds. \"No,\" she said in a\nlow, sleepy voice. \"Not yet.\"\n\nPilch was silent a moment. She said then, \"One more.\"\n\nTrigger looked and frowned. Presently she said, \"I have a feeling that\ndoes mean something. But all I get is that it's the faces of two clocks.\nOn one of them the hands are going around very fast. And on the other\nthey go around slowly.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Pilch said. She waited a little. \"No other thought about those\nclocks? Just that they should mean something?\"\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"That's all.\"\n\nPilch's hand moved on the desk again. The wall-screen went blank, and\nthe light in the little room brightened slowly. Pilch's face was\nreflective.\n\n\"That will have to do for now,\" she said. \"Trigger, this ship is working\non an urgent job somewhere else. We'll have to go back and finish that\njob. But I'll be able to return to Manon in about ten days, and then\nwe'll have another session. And I think that will get this little\nmystery cleared up.\"\n\n\"All of it?\"\n\n\"All of it, I'd say. The whole pattern seems to be moving into view.\nMore details will show up in the ten-day interval; and one more cautious\nboost then should bring it out in full.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"That's good news. I've been getting a little fed up\nwith being a kind of walking enigma.\"\n\n\"Don't blame you at all,\" Pilch said, sounding almost exactly like\nCommissioner Tate. \"Incidentally, you're a busy lady at present, but if\nyou do have half an hour to spare from time to time, you might just sit\ndown comfortably somewhere and listen to yourself thinking. The way\nthings are going, that should bring quite a bit of information to view.\"\n\nTrigger looked doubtful. \"Listen to myself thinking?\"\n\n\"You'll find yourself getting the knack of it rather quickly,\" Pilch\nsaid. She smiled. \"Just head off in that general direction whenever you\nfind the time, and don't work too hard at it. Are there any questions\nnow before we start back to Manon?\"\n\nTrigger studied her a moment. \"There's one thing I'd like to be sure\nabout,\" she said. \"But I suppose you people have your problems with\nSecurity too.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\" said Pilch. \"You're secure enough for me. Fire away.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Trigger said. \"Commissioner Tate told me people like you\ndon't work much with individuals.\"\n\n\"Not as much as we'd like to. That's true.\"\n\n\"So you wouldn't have been working with me if whatever has been going on\nweren't somehow connected with the plasmoids.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I would,\" said Pilch. \"Or old Cranadon. Someone like that. We\ndo give service as required when somebody has the good sense to ask for\nit. But obviously, we couldn't have dropped that other job just now and\ncome to Manon to clear up some individual difficulty.\"\n\n\"So I am involved with the plasmoid mess?\"\n\n\"You're right in the middle of it, Trigger. That's definite. In just\nwhat way is something we should be able to determine next session.\"\n\nPilch turned off the desk light and stood up. \"I always hate to run off\nand leave something half finished like this,\" she admitted, \"but I'll\nhave to run anyway. The plasmoids are nowhere near the head of the\nFederation's problem list at present. They're just coming up mighty\nfast.\"\n\nWhen Trigger reached her office next morning, she learned that the\nPsychology Service ship had moved out of the Manon area within an hour\nafter she'd been returned to the Headquarters dome the night before.\n\nNone of the members of the plasmoid team were around. The Commissioner,\nwho had a poor opinion of sleep, had been up for the past three hours;\nhe'd left word Trigger could reach him, if necessary, in the larger of\nhis two ships, parked next to the dome in Precol Port. Presumably he had\nthe ship sealed up and was sitting in the transmitter cabinet, swapping\nmessages with the I-Fleets in the Vishni area. He was likely to be at\nthat for hours more. Professor Mantelish hadn't yet got back from his\nlatest field trip, and Major Heslet Quillan just wasn't there.\n\nIt looked, Trigger decided, not at all reluctantly, like a good day to\nlean into her Precol job a bit. She told the staff to pitch everything\nnot utterly routine her way, and leaned.\n\nA set of vitally important reports from Precol's Giant Planet Survey\nSquad had been mislaid somewhere around Headquarters during yesterday's\nconferences. She soothed down the G P Squad and instituted a check\nsearch. A team of Hub ecologists, who had decided for themselves that\noutworld booster shots weren't required on Manon, called in nervously\nfrom a polar station to report that their hair was falling out. Trigger\ntapped the \"Manon Fever\" button on her desk, and suggested toupees.\n\nThe ecologists were displeased. A medical emergency skip-boat zoomed out\nof the dome to go to their rescue; and Trigger gave it its directions\nwhile dialing for the medical checker who'd allowed the visitors to\navoid their shots. She had a brief chat with the young man, and left him\ntwitching as the G P Squad came back on to inquire whether the reports\nhad been found yet. Trigger began to get a comfortable feeling of being\nback in the good old groove.\n\nThen a message from the Medical Department popped out on her desk. It\nwas addressed to Commissioner Tate and stated that Brule Inger was now\nable to speak again.\n\nTrigger frowned, sighed, bit her lip and thought a moment. She dialed\nfor Doctor Leehaven. \"Got your message,\" she said. \"How's he doing?\"\n\n\"All right,\" the old medic said.\n\n\"Has he said anything?\"\n\n\"No. He's scared. If he could get up the courage, he'd ask for a\npersonnel lawyer.\"\n\n\"Yes, I imagine. Tell him this then--from the Commissioner; not from\nme--there'll be no charges, but Precol expects his resignation, end of\nthe month.\"\n\n\"That on the level?\" Doctor Leehaven demanded incredulously.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThe doctor snorted. \"You people are getting soft-headed! But I'll tell\nhim.\"\n\nThe morning went on. Trigger was suspiciously studying a traffic control\nnote stating that a Devagas missionary ship had checked in and berthed\nat the spaceport when the G C Center's management called in to report,\nwith some nervousness, that the Center's much advertised\nmeteor-repellent roof had just flipped several dozen tons of falling\nMoon Belt material into the spaceport area. Most of it, unfortunately,\nhad dropped around and upon a Devagas missionary ship.\n\n\"Not damaged, is it?\" she asked.\n\nThe Center said no, but the Missionary Captain insisted on speaking to\nthe person in charge here. To whom should they refer him?\n\n\"Refer him to me,\" Trigger said expectantly. She switched on the vision\nscreen.\n\nThe Missionary Captain was a tall, gray-haired, gray-eyed, square-jawed\nman in uniform. After confirming to his satisfaction that Trigger was\nindeed in charge, he informed her in chilled tones that the Devagas\nUnion would hold her personally responsible for the unprovoked outrage\nunless an apology was promptly forthcoming.\n\nTrigger apologized promptly. He acknowledged with a curt nod.\n\n\"The ship will now require new spacepaint,\" he pointed out, unmollified.\n\nTrigger nodded. \"We'll send a work squad out immediately.\"\n\n\"We,\" the Missionary Captain said, \"shall supervise the work. Only the\nbest grade of paint will be acceptable!\"\n\n\"The very best only,\" Trigger agreed.\n\nHe gave her another curt nod, and switched off.\n\n\"Ass,\" she said. She cut in the don't-disturb barrier and dialed\nHolati's ship.\n\nIt took a while to get through; he was probably busy somewhere in the\ncrate. Like Belchik Pluly, the Commissioner, while still a very wealthy\nman, would have been a very much wealthier one if it weren't for his\nhobby. In his case, the hobby was ships, of which he now owned two. What\nmade them expensive was that they had been tailor-made to the\nCommissioner's specifications, and his specifications had provided him\nwith two rather exact duplicates of the two types of Scout fighting\nships in which Squadron Commander Tate had made space hideous for\nevildoers in the good old days. Nobody as yet had got up the nerve to\npoint out to him that private battlecraft definitely were not allowable\nin the Manon System.\n\nHe came on finally. Trigger told him about the Devagas. \"Did you know\nthose characters were in the area?\" she asked.\n\nThe Commissioner knew. They'd stopped in at the system check station\nthree days before. The ship was clean. \"Their missionaries all go armed,\nof course; but that's their privilege by treaty. They've been browsing\naround and going hither and yon in skiffs. The ship's been in orbit till\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"Think they're here in connection with whatever Balmordan is up to?\"\nTrigger inquired.\n\n\"We'll take that for granted. Balmordan, by the way, attended a big\nshindig on the Pluly yacht yesterday. Unless his tail goofed, he's still\nup there, apparently staying on as a guest.\"\n\n\"Are you having these other Devagas watched?\"\n\n\"Not individually. Too many of them, and they're scattered all over the\nplace. Mantelish got back. He checked in an hour ago.\"\n\n\"You mean he's upstairs in his quarters now?\" she asked.\n\n\"Right. He had a few more crates hauled into the lab, and he's locked\nhimself in with them and spy-blocked the place. May have got something\nimportant, and may just be going through one of his secrecy periods\nagain. We'll find out by and by. Oh, and here's a social note. The First\nLady of Tranest is shopping in the Grand Commerce Center this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, that should boost business,\" said Trigger. \"Are you going to be\nback in the dome by lunchtime?\"\n\n\"I think so. Might have some interesting news, too, incidentally.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she said. \"See you then.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later the desk transmitter gave her the \"to be shielded\"\nsignal. Up went the barrier again.\n\nMajor Quillan's face looked out at her from the screen. He was, Trigger\nsaw, in Mantelish's lab. Mantelish stood at a work bench behind him.\n\n\"Hi!\" he said.\n\n\"Hi, yourself. When did you get in?\"\n\n\"Just now. Could you pick up the whoosis-and-whichis and bring it up\nhere?\"\n\n\"Right now?\"\n\n\"If you can,\" Quillan said. \"The professor's got something new, he\nthinks.\"\n\n\"I'm on my way,\" said Trigger. \"Take about five minutes.\"\n\nShe hurried down to her quarters, summoned Repulsive's container into\nthe room and slung the strap over her shoulder.\n\nThen she stood still a moment, frowning slightly. Something--something\nlike a wisp of memory, something she _should_ be remembering--was\nstirring in the back of her mind. Then it was gone.\n\nTrigger shook her head. It would keep. She opened the door and stepped\nout into the hall.\n\nShe fell down.\n\nAs she fell, she tried to give the bag the send-off squeeze, but she\ncouldn't move her fingers. She couldn't move anything.\n\nThere were people around her. They were doing things swiftly. She was\nturned over on her back and, for a few moments then, she saw her own\nface smiling down at her from just a few feet away.\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nShe was, suddenly, in a large room, well lit, with elaborate\nfurnishings--sitting leaned back in a soft chair before a highly\npolished little table. On the opposite side of the table two people sat\nlooking at her with expressions of mild surprise. One of them was Lyad\nErmetyne. The other was a man she didn't know.\n\nThe man glanced aside at Lyad. \"Very fast snap-back!\" he said. He looked\nagain at Trigger. He was a small man with salt-and-pepper hair, a deeply\nlined face, beautiful liquid-black eyes.\n\n\"Very!\" Lyad said. \"We must remember that. Hello, Trigger!\"\n\n\"Hello,\" Trigger said. Her glance went once around the room and came\nback to Lyad's amiably observant face. Repulsive's container was nowhere\naround. There seemed to be nobody else in the room. An ornamental\nComWeb stood against one wall. Two of the walls were covered with heavy\nhangings, and a great gold-brocaded canopy bellied from the ceiling. No\ndoors or portals in sight; they might be camouflaged, or behind those\nhangings. Any number of people could be in call range--and a few\ncertainly must be watching her right now, because that small man was no\nrough-and-tumble type.\n\nThe small man was regarding her with something like restrained\namusement.\n\n\"A cool one,\" he murmured. \"Very cool!\"\n\nTrigger looked at him a moment, then turned her eyes back to Lyad. She\ndidn't feel cool. She felt tense and scared cold. This was probably very\nbad!\n\n\"What did you want to see me about?\" she asked.\n\nLyad smiled. \"A business matter. Do you know where you are?\"\n\n\"Not on your ship, First Lady.\"\n\nThe light-amber eyes barely narrowed. But Lyad had become, at that\nmoment, very alert.\n\n\"Why do you think so?\" she asked pleasantly.\n\n\"This room,\" said Trigger. \"You don't gush, I think. What was the\nbusiness matter?\"\n\n\"In a moment,\" Lyad said. She smiled again. \"Where else might you be?\"\n\nTrigger thought she could guess. But she didn't intend to. Not out loud.\nShe shrugged. \"It's no place I want to be.\" She settled back a little in\nher chair. Her right hand brushed the porgee pouch.\n\nThe porgee pouch.\n\nIt would have been like the Ermetyne to investigate the pouch carefully,\ntake out the gun and put the pouch back. But they might not have.\n\nSomebody was bound to be watching. She couldn't find out--not until the\ninstant after she decided to try the Denton.\n\n\"I can believe that,\" Lyad said. \"Forgive me the discourtesy of so\nurgent an invitation, Trigger. A quite recent event made it seem\nnecessary. As to the business--as a start, this gentleman is Doctor\nVeetonia. He is an investigator of extraordinary talents along his line.\nAt the moment, he is a trifle tired because of the very long hours he\nworked last night.\"\n\nDoctor Veetonia turned his head to look at her. \"I did, First Lady?\nWell, that does explain this odd weariness. Did I work well?\"\n\n\"Splendidly,\" Lyad assured him. \"You were never better, Doctor.\"\n\nHe nodded, smiled vaguely and looked back at Trigger. \"This must go,\ntoo, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it must,\" Lyad said.\n\n\"A great pity!\" Doctor Veetonia said. \"A great pity. It would have been\na pleasant memory. This very cool one!\" The vague smile shifted in the\nlined face again. \"You are so beautiful, child,\" he told Trigger, \"in\nyour anger and terror and despair. And above it still the gauging\npurpose, the strong, quick thinking. You will not give in easily. Oh,\nno! Not easily at all. First Lady,\" Doctor Veetonia said plaintively, \"I\nshould like to remember this one! It should be possible, I think.\"\n\nSmall, icy fingers were working up and down Trigger's spine. The\nErmetyne gave her a light wink.\n\n\"I'm afraid it isn't, Doctor,\" she said. \"There are such very important\nmatters to be discussed. Besides, Trigger Argee and I will come to an\namicable agreement very quickly.\"\n\n\"No.\" Doctor Veetonia's face had turned very sullen.\n\n\"No?\" said Lyad.\n\n\"She will agree to nothing. Any fool can see that. I recommend, then, a\nsimple chemical approach. Your creatures can handle it. Drain her. Throw\nher away. I will have nothing to do with the matter.\"\n\n\"Oh, but Doctor!\" the Ermetyne protested. \"That would be so crude. And\nso very uncertain. Why, we might be here for hours still!\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nLyad smiled. She stroked the lined cheek with light finger tips. \"Have\nyou forgotten the palace at Hamal Lake?\" she asked. \"The great library?\nThe laboratories? Haven't I been very generous?\"\n\nDoctor Veetonia turned his face toward her. He smiled thoughtfully.\n\n\"Now that is true!\" he admitted. \"For the moment I did forget.\" He\nlooked back at Trigger. \"The First Lady gives,\" he told her, \"and the\nFirst Lady takes away. She has given me wealth and much leisure. She\ntakes from me now and then a memory. Very skillfully, since she was my\npupil. But still the mind must be dim by a little each time it is\ndone.\"\n\nHis face suddenly grew concerned. He looked at Lyad again. \"Two more\nyears only!\" he said. \"In two years I shall be free to retire, Lyad?\"\n\nLyad nodded. \"That was our bargain, Doctor. You know I keep bargains.\"\n\nDoctor Veetonia said, \"Yes. You do. It is strange in an Ermetyne. Very\nwell! I shall do it.\" He looked at Trigger's face. The black-liquid eyes\nblinked once or twice. \"She is almost certain she is being watched,\" he\nsaid, \"but she has been thinking of using the ComWeb. The child, I\nbelieve, is prepared to attack us at any opportune moment.\" He smiled.\n\"Show her first why her position is hopeless. Then we shall see.\"\n\n\"Why, it's not in the least hopeless,\" Lyad said. \"And please feel no\nconcern about the Doctor, Trigger. His methods are quite painless and\ninvolve none of the indignities of a chemical investigation. If you are\nat all reasonable, we'll just sit here and talk for twenty minutes or\nso. Then you will tell me what sum you wish to have deposited for you in\nwhat bank, and you will be free to go.\"\n\n\"What will we talk about?\" Trigger said.\n\n\"Well, for one,\" said the Ermetyne, \"there is that rather handsome\nlittle purse you've been carrying about lately. My technicians inform me\nthere may be some risk of damaging its contents if they attempt to force\nit open. We don't want that. So we'll talk a bit about the proper way of\nopening it.\" She gave Trigger her little smile. \"And Doctor Veetonia\nwill verify the accuracy of any statements made on the matter.\"\n\nShe considered. \"Oh, and then I shall ask a few questions. Not many. And\nyou will answer them. It really will be quite simple. But now let me\ntell you why I so very much wanted to see you today. We had a guest here\nlast night. A gentleman whom you've met--Balmordan. He was mind-blocked\non some quite important subjects, and so--though the doctor and I were\nvery patient and careful--he died in the end. But before he died, he had\ntold me as much as I really needed to know from him.\n\n\"Now with that information,\" she went on, \"and with the contents of your\npurse and with another little piece of information, which you possess, I\nshall presently go away. On Orado, a few hours later, Tranest's\nambassador will have a quiet talk with some members of the Federation\nCouncil. And that will be all, really.\" She smiled. \"No dramatic\npursuit! No hue and cry! A few treaties will be considerably revised.\nAnd the whole hubbub about the plasmoids will be over.\" She nodded.\n\"Because they can be made to work, you know. And very well!\"\n\nDoctor Veetonia hadn't looked away from Trigger while Lyad was speaking.\nHe said now, \"My congratulations, First Lady! But the girl has not been\nconvinced in the least that she should cooperate. She may hope to be\nrescued before the information you want can be forced from her.\"\n\nThe Ermetyne sighed. \"Oh, really now, Trigger!\" she very nearly pouted.\n\"Well, if I must explain about that to you, too, I shall.\"\n\nShe considered a moment.\n\n\"Did you see your facsimile?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Very briefly.\"\n\nLyad smiled. \"How she and my other people passed in and out of that\ndome, and how it happened that your room guards were found unconscious\nand were very hurriedly taken to the medical department's contagious\nward, makes an amusing little story. But it would be too long in the\ntelling just now. Your facsimile is one of Tranest's finest actresses.\nShe's been studying and practicing being you for months. She knows where\nto go and what to do in that dome to avoid contact with people who know\nyou too intimately. If it seems that discovery is imminent, she needs\nonly a minute by herself to turn into an entirely different personality.\nSo hours might pass without anyone even suspecting you were gone.\n\n\"But on the other hand,\" Lyad admitted fairly, \"your double might be\ncaught immediately or within minutes. She would not be conscious then,\nand I doubt your fierce little Commissioner would go to the unethical\nlimits of dead-braining a live woman. If he did, of course, he would\nlearn nothing from her.\n\n\"Let's assume, nevertheless, that for one reason and another your\nfriends suspect me immediately, and only me. At the time you were being\ntaken from the dome, I was observed leaving the Grand Commerce Center.\nI'd shopped rather freely; a number of fairly large crates and so forth\nwere loaded into my speedboat. And we were observed returning to the\nAurora.\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" Trigger admitted. \"Another facsimile, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" The Ermetyne glanced at a small jeweled wrist watch. \"Now\nthe Aurora, if my orders were being followed, and they were, dived\napproximately five minutes ago--unless somebody who might be your\nwrathful rescuers approached her before that time, in which case she\ndived then. In either case, the dive was seen by the Commissioner's\nwatchers; and the proper conclusions sooner or later will be drawn from\nthat.\"\n\n\"Supposing they dive after her and run her down?\" Trigger said.\n\n\"They might! The Aurora is not an easy ship to run down in subspace; but\nthey might. After some hours. It would be of no consequence at all,\nwould it?\" The amber eyes regarded Trigger with very little expression\nfor a moment. \"How many hours or minutes do you think you could hold out\nhere, Trigger Argee, if it became necessary to put on real pressure?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Trigger admitted. She moistened her lips.\n\n\"I could give you a rather close estimate, I think,\" the Ermetyne said.\n\"But forgive me for bringing up that matter. It was an unnecessary\ndiscourtesy. Let's assume instead that the rather clever people with\nwhom you've been working are quite clever enough to see through all\nthese little maneuverings. Let's assume further that they are even able\nto conclude immediately where you and I must be at the moment.\n\n\"We are, as it happens, on the Griffin, which is Belchik Pluly's outsize\nyacht, and which is orbiting Manon at present. This room is on a sealed\nlevel of the yacht, where Belchik's private life normally goes on\nundisturbed. I persuaded him two days ago to clear out this section of\nit for my own use. There is only one portal entry to the level, and that\nentry is locked and heavily guarded at the moment. There are two portal\nexits. One of them opens into a special lock in which there is a small\nspeedboat of mine, prepared to leave. It's a very fast boat. If there\nhave been faster ones built in the Hub, I haven't heard of them yet. And\nit can dive directly from the lock.\"\n\nShe smiled at Trigger. \"You have the picture now, haven't you? If your\nfriends decide to board the Griffin, they'll be able to do it without\ntoo much argument. After all, we don't want to be blown up accidentally.\nBut they'll have quite a time working their way into this level. If a\nboarding party is reported, we'll just all quietly go away together with\nno fuss or hurry. I guarantee that no one is going to trace or overtake\nthat boat. You see?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Trigger said disconsolately, slumping back a little. Her right\nhand dropped to her lap. Well, she thought, last chance!\n\nDoctor Veetonia frowned. \"First--\" he began.\n\nTrigger slapped the porgee pouch. And the Denton's soundless blast\nslammed the talented investigator back and over in his chair.\n\n\"Gun,\" Trigger explained unnecessarily.\n\nThe Ermetyne's face had turned white with shock. She flicked a glance\ndown at the man, then looked back at Trigger.\n\n\"There're guns on me too, I imagine,\" Trigger said. \"But this one goes\noff very easily, First Lady! It would take hardly any jolt at all.\"\n\nLyad nodded slightly. \"They're no fools! They won't risk shooting. Don't\nworry.\" Her voice was careful but quite even. A tough cookie, as the\nCommissioner had remarked.\n\n\"We won't bother about them at the moment,\" Trigger said. \"Let's stand\nup together.\"\n\nThey stood up.\n\n\"We'll stay about five feet apart,\" Trigger went on. \"I don't know if\nyou're the gun-grabbing type.\"\n\nThe Ermetyne almost smiled. \"I'm not!\" she said.\n\n\"No point in taking chances,\" Trigger said. \"Five feet.\" She gave Doctor\nVeetonia a quick glance. He did look very unpleasantly dead.\n\n\"We'll go over to that ComWeb in a moment,\" she told Lyad. \"I imagine\nyou wouldn't have left it on open circuit?\"\n\nLyad shook her head. \"Calls go through the ship's communication office.\"\n\n\"Your own people on duty there?\"\n\n\"No. Pluly's.\"\n\n\"Will they take your orders?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\"\n\n\"Can they listen in?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Not if we seal the set here.\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"You'll do the talking,\" she said. \"I'll give you\nCommissioner Tate's personal number. Tell them to dial it. The Precol\ntransmitters pick up ComWeb circuits. Switch on the screen after the\ncall is in; he'll want to see me. When he comes on, just tell him what's\nhappened, where we are, what the layout is. He's to come over with a\nsquad to get us. I won't say much, if anything. I'll just keep the gun\non you. If there's any fumble, we both get it.\"\n\n\"There won't be any fumble, Trigger,\" Lyad said.\n\n\"All right. Let's set up the rest of it before we move. After the\nCommissioner signs off, he'll be up here in three minutes flat. Or less.\nHow about this ship's officers--do they take your orders too?\"\n\n\"With the obvious exception of yourself,\" Lyad said, \"everyone on the\nGriffin takes my orders at the moment.\"\n\n\"Then just tell whoever's in charge of the yacht to let the squad in\nbefore there's any shooting. The Commissioner can get awfully\nshort-tempered. Then get the guards away from that entry portal. That's\nfor their own good.\"\n\nThe Ermetyne nodded. \"Will do.\"\n\n\"All right. That covers it, I think.\"\n\nThey looked at each other for a moment.\n\n\"With the information you got from Balmordan,\" Trigger remarked, \"you\nshould still be able to make a very good dicker with the Council, First\nLady. I understand they're very eager to get the plasmoid mess\nstraightened out quietly.\"\n\nLyad lifted one shoulder in a brief shrug. \"Perhaps,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's move!\" said Trigger.\n\nThey walked toward the ComWeb rather edgily, not very fast, not very\nslow, Trigger four or five steps behind. There had been no sound from\nthe walls and no other sign of what must be very considerable excitement\nnearby. Trigger's spine kept tingling. A needlebeam and a good marksman\ncould pluck away the Denton and her hand along with it, without much\nreal risk to Ermetyne. But probably even the smallest of risks was more\nthan the Tranest people would be willing to take when the First Lady's\nperson was involved.\n\nLyad reached the ComWeb and stopped. Trigger stopped too, five feet\naway. \"Go ahead,\" she said quietly.\n\nLyad turned to face her. \"Let me make one last--well, call it an\nappeal,\" she said. \"Don't be an overethical fool, Trigger Argee! The\narrangement I've planned will do no harm to anybody. Come in with me,\nand you can write your own ticket for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"No ticket,\" Trigger said. She waggled the Denton slightly. \"Go ahead!\nYou can talk to the Council later.\"\n\nLyad shrugged resignedly, turned again and reached toward the ComWeb.\n\nTrigger might have relaxed just a trifle at that moment. Or perhaps\nthere was some other cue that Pilli could pick up. There came no sound\nfrom the ceiling canopy. What she caught was a sense of something\nmoving above her. Then the great golden bulk landed with a terrifying\nlightness on the thick carpet between Lyad and herself.\n\nThe eyeless nightmare head wasn't three feet from her own.\n\nThe lights in the room went out.\n\nTrigger flung herself backwards, rolled six feet to one side, stood up,\nbacked away and stopped again.\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nThe blackness in the room was complete. She spun the Denton to kill.\nThere was silence around her and then a soft rustling at some distance.\nIt might have been the cautious shuffle of a heavy foot over thick\ncarpeting. It stopped again. Where was Lyad?\n\nHer eyes shifted about, trying to pierce the darkness. Black-light, she\nthought. She said, \"Lyad?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Lyad's voice came easily in the dark. She might be standing about\nthirty feet away, at the far end of the room.\n\n\"Call your animal off,\" Trigger said quietly. \"I don't want to kill it.\"\nShe began moving in the direction from which Lyad had spoken.\n\n\"Pilli won't hurt you, Trigger,\" the Ermetyne said. \"He's been sent in\nto disarm you, that's all. Throw your gun away and he won't even touch\nyou.\" She laughed. \"Don't bother shooting in my direction either! I'm\nnot in the room any more.\"\n\nTrigger stopped. Not because of what that hateful, laughing voice had\nsaid. But because in the dark about her a fresh, pungent smell was\ngrowing. The smell of ripe apples.\n\nShe moistened her lips. She whispered, \"Pilli--keep away!\" Eyeless, the\ndark would mean nothing to it. Seconds later, she heard the thing\nbreathing.\n\nShe faced the sound. It stopped for a moment, then it came again. A slow\nanimal breathing. It seemed to circle slowly to her left. After a little\nit stopped. Then it was coming toward her.\n\nShe said softly, almost pleadingly, \"Pilli, stop! Go back, Pilli!\"\n\nSilence. Pilli's odor lay heavily all around. Trigger heard her blood\ndrumming in her ears, and, for a second then, she imagined she could\nfeel, like a tangible fog, the body warmth of the monster standing in\nthe dark before her.\n\nIt wasn't imagination. Something like a smooth, heavy pad of rubber\nclosed around her right wrist and tightened terribly.\n\nThe Denton went off, two, three, four times before she was jerked\nviolently sideways, flung away, sent stumbling backward against some low\npiece of furniture and, sprawling, over it. The gun was lost.\n\nAs she scrambled dizzily to her feet, Pilli screamed. It was a thin,\nhigh, breathless sound like the screaming of a terrified human child. It\nstopped abruptly. And, as if that had been a signal, the room came full\nof light again.\n\nTrigger blinked dazedly against the light. Virod stood before her,\nlooking at her, a pair of opaque yellow goggles shoved up on his\nforehead. Black-light glasses. The golden-haired thing lay in a great\nshapeless huddle on the floor twenty feet to one side. She couldn't see\nher gun. But Virod held one, pointing at her.\n\nVirod's other hand moved suddenly. Its palm caught the side of her face\nin a hefty slap. Trigger staggered dumbly sideways, got her balance and\nstood facing him again. She didn't even feel anger. Her cheek began to\nburn.\n\n\"Stop amusing yourself, Virod!\" It was Lyad's voice. Trigger saw her\nthen, standing in a small half-opened door across the room, where a wall\nhanging had been folded away.\n\n\"She appeared to be in shock, First Lady,\" Virod explained blandly.\n\n\"Is Pilli dead?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have her gun. He got it from her.\" Virod slapped a pocket of his\njacket, and some part of Trigger's mind noted the gesture and suddenly\ncame awake.\n\n\"So I saw. Well--too bad about Pilli. But it was necessary. Bring her\nhere then. And be reasonably gentle.\" Lyad still sounded unruffled. \"And\nput that gun in a different pocket, fool, or she'll take it away from\nyou.\"\n\nShe looked at Trigger impersonally as Virod brought her to the little\ndoor, his left hand clamped on her arm just above the elbow.\n\nShe said, \"Too bad you killed my expert, Trigger! We'll have to use a\nchemical approach now. Flam and Virod are quite good at that, but there\nwill be some pain. Not too much, because I'll be watching them. But it\nwill be rather undignified, I'm afraid. And it will take a great deal\nlonger.\"\n\nTanned, tall, sinuous Flam stood in the small room beyond the door.\nTrigger saw a long, low, plastic-covered table, clamps and glittering\ngadgetry. That would have been where cold-fish Balmordan hadn't been\nable to make it against his mind-blocks finally. There was still one\nthing she could do. The yacht was orbiting.\n\n\"That sort of thing won't be at all necessary!\" she said shakily. Her\nvoice shook with great ease, as if it had been practicing it all along.\n\n\"No?\" Lyad said.\n\n\"You've won,\" Trigger said resignedly. \"I'll play along now. I'll show\nyou how to open that handbag, to start with.\"\n\nLyad nodded. \"How do you open it?\"\n\n\"You have to press it in the right places. Have them bring it here. I'll\nshow you.\"\n\nLyad laughed. \"You're a little too eager. And much too docile, Trigger!\nConsidering what's in that handbag, it's not at all likely it will\ndetonate if we brightly hand it to you and let you start pressing. But\nsomething or other of a very undesirable nature would certainly happen!\nFlam--\"\n\nThe tall redhead nodded and smiled. She went over to a wall cabinet,\nunlocked it and took out Repulsive's container.\n\nLyad said, \"Put it on that shelf for the moment. Then bring me Virod's\ngun, and hers.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to go up on that table now, Trigger,\" she said.\n\"If you've really decided to cooperate, it won't be too bad. And, by and\nby, you'll start telling us very exactly what should be done with that\nhandbag. And a few other things.\"\n\nShe might have caught Trigger's expression then. She added drily, \"I was\ninformed a few nights ago that you're quite an artist in\nrough-and-tumble tactics. So are Virod and Flam. So if you want to give\nVirod an opportunity to amuse himself a little, go right ahead!\"\n\nAt that point, the graceful thing undoubtedly would have been to just\nsmile and get up on the table. Trigger discovered she couldn't do it.\nShe gave them a fast, silent, vicious tussle, mouth clenched, breathing\nhard through her nose. It was quite insanely useless. They weren't\nletting her get anywhere near Lyad. After Virod had amused himself a\nlittle, he picked her up and plunked her down on the table. A minute\nlater, she was stretched out on it, face down, wrists and ankles secured\nwith padded clamps to its surface.\n\nFlam took a small knife and neatly slit the back of the Precol uniform\nopen along the line of her spine. She folded the cloth away. Then\nTrigger felt the thin icy touches of some vanilla-smelling spray walk up\nher, ending at the base of her skull.\n\nIt wasn't so very painful; Lyad had told the truth about that. But\npresently it became extremely undignified. Then her thoughts were\nspeeding up and slowing down and swirling around in an odd, confusing\nfashion. And at last her voice began to say things she didn't want it to\nsay.\n\nAfter this, there might have been a pause. She seemed to be floating up\nout of a small pool of sleep when Lyad's voice said somewhere, with cold\nfury in it: \"There's _nothing_ inside?\"\n\nA whole little series of memory-pictures popped up suddenly then, like a\nchain of firecrackers somebody had set off. They formed themselves into\na pattern; and there the pattern was in Trigger's mind. She looked at\nit. Her eyes flew open in surprise. She began to laugh weakly.\n\nLight footsteps came quickly over to her. \"Where is that plasmoid,\nTrigger?\"\n\nThe Ermetyne was in a fine, towering rage. She'd better say something.\n\n\"Ask the Commissioner,\" she said, mumbling a little.\n\n\"It's wearing off, First Lady,\" said Flam. \"Shall I?\"\n\nTrigger's thoughts went eddying away for a moment, and she didn't hear\nLyad's reply. But then the vanilla smell was there again, and the thin\nicy touches. This time, they stopped abruptly, halfway.\n\nAnd then there was a very odd stillness all around Trigger. As if\neverybody and everything had stopped moving together.\n\nA deep, savage voice said, \"I hope there'll be no trouble, folks. I just\nwant her a lot worse than you do.\"\n\nTrigger frowned in puzzlement. Next came an angry roar, some thumping\nsounds, a sudden crack.\n\n\"Oops!\" the deep voice said happily. \"A little too hard, I'm afraid!\"\n\nWhy, of course, Trigger thought. She opened her eyes and twisted her\nhead around.\n\n\"Still awake, Trigger?\" Quillan asked from the door of the room. He\nlooked pleasantly surprised. There was a very large bellmouthed gun in\nhis hand.\n\nThat was an odd-looking little group in the doorway, Trigger felt. On\nhis knees before Quillan was a fat, elderly man, blinking dazedly at\nher. He wore a brilliantly purple bath towel knotted about his loins and\nnothing else. It was a moment before she recognized Belchik Pluly. Old\nBelchy! And on the floor before Belchy, motionless as if in devout\nprostration, Virod lay on his face. Dead, no doubt. He shouldn't have\ngot gay with Quillan.\n\n\"Yes,\" Trigger said then, remembering Quillan's question. \"I've got a\nvery fast snap-back--but they fed me a fresh load of dope just a moment\nago.\"\n\n\"So I saw,\" said Quillan. His glance shifted beyond Trigger.\n\n\"Lyad,\" he said, almost gently.\n\n\"Yes, Quillan?\" Lyad's voice came from the other side of Trigger.\nTrigger turned her head toward it. Lyad and Flam both stood at the far\nside of the room. Their expressions were unhappy.\n\n\"I don't like at all,\" Quillan said, \"what's been going on here. Not\none bit! Which is why Big Boy got the neck broken finally. Can the rest\nof us take a hint?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Ermetyne said.\n\n\"So the Flam girl quits ogling those guns on the shelf and stays put, or\nthey'll amputate a leg. First Lady, you come up to the table and get\nTrigger unclamped.\"\n\nTrigger realized her eyes had fallen shut again. She left them that way\nfor a moment. There was motion near her, and the wrist clamps came off\nin turn. Lyad moved down to her feet.\n\n\"The fancy-looking gun is Trigger's?\" Quillan inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lyad.\n\n\"Is that what happened to Pilli and the other gent out there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Imagine!\" said Quillan thoughtfully. \"Uh--got something to seal up the\nclothes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lyad said. \"Bring it here, Flam.\"\n\n\"Toss it, Flam!\" cautioned Quillan. \"Remember the leg.\"\n\nLyad's hands did things to the clothes at her back. Then they went away.\n\n\"You can sit up now, Trigger!\" Quillan's voice informed her loudly.\n\"Sort of slide down easy off the table and see if you can stand.\"\n\nTrigger opened her eyes, twisted about, slid her legs over the edge of\nthe table, came down on her feet, stood.\n\n\"I want my gun and the handbag,\" she announced. She saw them again then,\non the shelf, walked over and picked up the plasmoid container. She\nlooked inside, snapped it shut and slung the strap over her shoulder.\nShe picked up the Denton, looked at its setting, spun it and turned.\n\n\"First Lady--\" she said.\n\nLyad went white around the lips. Quillan made some kind of startled\nsound. Trigger shot.\n\nFlam ran at her then, screaming, arms waving, eyes wild and green like\nan animal's. Trigger half turned and shot again.\n\nShe looked at Quillan. \"Just stunned,\" she explained. She waited.\n\nQuillan let his breath out slowly. \"Glad to hear it!\" He glanced down at\nPluly. \"Purse was open,\" he remarked significantly.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Trigger agreed.\n\n\"How's the doohinkus?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Safe and sound! Believe me.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he said. He still looked somewhat puzzled. \"Put the eye on\nBelchy for a few seconds then. We're taking Lyad along. I'll have to\ncarry her now.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Trigger said. She felt rather jaunty at the moment. She put the\neye on Belchik. Belchik moaned.\n\nThey started out of the little room, Pluly in the van, clutching his\ntowel. The Ermetyne, dangling loosely over Quillan's left shoulder,\nlooked fairly gruesomely dead. \"You walk this side of me, Trigger,\"\nQuillan said. \"Still all right?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes.\" Actually she wasn't quite. It was mainly a problem\nwith her thoughts, which showed a tendency to move along in odd little\nleaps and bounds, with short stops in between, as if something were\ntrying to freeze them up. But if it was going to be like the first time,\nshe should last till they got to wherever they were going.\n\nHalfway across the room, she saw the golden thing like a huge furry sack\non the carpet and shivered. \"Poor Pilli!\" she said.\n\n\"Alas!\" Quillan said politely. \"I gather you didn't just stun Pilli?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Couldn't,\" she said. \"Too big. Too fast.\"\n\n\"How about the other one?\"\n\n\"Oh, him. Stunned. He's an investigator. They thought he was dead,\nthough. That's what scared Lyad and Flam.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Quillan said thoughtfully. \"It would.\"\n\nAnother section of wall hanging had folded aside, and a wide door stood\nopen behind it. They went through the door and turned into a mirrored\npassageway, Pluly still tottering rapidly ahead. \"Might keep that gun\nready, Trigger,\" Quillan warned. \"We just could get jumped here. Don't\nthink so, though. They'd have to get past the Commissioner.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's here, too?\"\n\nShe didn't hear what Quillan answered, because things faded out around\nthen. When they faded in again, the passageway with the mirrors had\ndisappeared, and they were coming to the top of a short flight of low,\nwide stairs and into a very beautiful room. This room was high and\nlong, not very wide. In the center was a small square swimming pool, and\nagainst the walls on either side was a long row of tall square crystal\npillars through which strange lights undulated slowly. Trigger glanced\ncuriously at the nearest pillar. She stopped short.\n\n\"Galaxy!\" she said, startled.\n\nQuillan reached back and grabbed her arm with his gun hand. \"Keep\nmoving, girl! That's just how Belchik keeps his harem grouped around him\nwhen he's working. Not too bad an idea--it does cut down the chatter.\nThis is his office.\"\n\n\"Office!\" Then she saw the large business desk with prosaic standard\nequipment which stood on the carpet on the other side of the pool. They\nmoved rapidly past the pool, Quillan still hauling at her arm. Trigger\nkept staring at the pillars they passed. Long-limbed, supple and\nlanguid, they floated in their crystal cages, in tinted, shifting\nlights, eyes closed, hair drifting about their faces.\n\n\"Awesome, isn't it?\" Quillan's voice said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Trigger. \"Awesome. One in each--he is a pig! They look\ndrowned.\"\n\n\"He is and they aren't,\" said Quillan. \"Very lively girls when he lets\nthem out. Now around this turn and ... oops!\"\n\nPluly had reached the turn at the end of the row of pillars, moaned\nagain and fallen forwards.\n\n\"Fainted!\" Quillan said. \"Well, we don't need him any more. Watch your\nstep, Trigger--dead one just behind Pluly.\"\n\nTrigger stretched her stride and cleared the dead one behind Pluly\nneatly. There were three more dead ones lying inside the entrance to the\nnext big room. She went past them, feeling rather dreamy. The sight of a\nsquat, black subtub parked squarely on the thick purple carpeting ahead\nof her, with its canopy up, didn't strike her as unusual. Then she saw\nthat the man leaning against the canopy, a gun in one hand, was\nCommissioner Tate. She smiled.\n\nShe waved her hand at him as they came up. \"Hi, Holati!\"\n\n\"Hi, yourself,\" said the Commissioner. He asked Quillan, \"How's she\ndoing?\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" Quillan said. \"A bit ta-ta at the moment. Double dose of\nceridim, by the smell of it. Had a little trouble here, I see.\"\n\n\"A little,\" the Commissioner acknowledged. \"They went for their guns.\"\n\n\"Very uninformed gentlemen,\" said Quillan. He let Lyad's limp form slide\noff his shoulder, and bent forward to lower her into the subtub's back\nseat. Trigger had been waiting for a chance to get into the\nconversation.\n\n\"Just who,\" she demanded now, frowning, \"is a bit ta-ta at the moment?\"\n\n\"You,\" said Quillan. \"You're doped, remember? You'll ride up front with\nthe Commissioner. Here.\" He picked her up, plasmoid purse and all, and\nset her down on the front seat. Holati Tate, she discovered then, was\nalready inside. Quillan swung down into the seat behind her. The canopy\nsnapped shut above.\n\nThe Commissioner shifted the tub's controls. In the screens, the room\noutside vanished. A darkness went rushing downwards past them.\n\nA thought suddenly popped to mind again, and Trigger burst into tears.\nThe Commissioner glanced over at her.\n\n\"What's the matter, Trigger girl?\"\n\n\"I'm so s-sorry I killed Pilli. He s-screamed.\"\n\nThen her mind froze up with a jolt, and thinking stopped completely.\nQuillan reached over the back of the seat and eased her over on her\nside.\n\n\"Got to her finally!\" he said. He sat down again. He brooded a moment.\n\"She shouldn't get so disturbed about that Pilli thing,\" he remarked\nthen. \"It couldn't have lived anyway.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" the Commissioner said absently, watching the screens. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Its brains,\" Quillan explained, \"were too far apart.\"\n\nThe Commissioner blinked. \"It's getting to you too, son!\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nTrigger came out of the ceridim trance hours before Lyad awoke from the\nstunner blast she'd absorbed. The Commissioner was sitting in a chair\nbeside her bunk, napping.\n\nShe looked around a moment, feeling very comfortable and secure. This\nwas her personal cabin on Commissioner Tate's ship, the one he referred\nto as the Big Job, modeled after the long-range patrol ships of the\nSpace Scouts. It wasn't actually very big, but six or seven people could\ngo traveling around in it very comfortably. At the moment it appeared to\nbe howling through subspace at its hellish rate again, going somewhere.\n\nWell, that could keep.\n\nTrigger reached out and poked the Commissioner's knee. \"Hey, Holati!\"\nshe whispered. \"Wake up.\"\n\nHis eyes opened. He looked at her and smiled. \"Back again, eh?\" he said.\n\nTrigger motioned at the door. \"Close it,\" she whispered. \"Got something\nto tell you.\"\n\n\"Talk away,\" he said. \"Quillan's piloting, the First Lady's out cold,\nand Mantelish got dive-sick and I doped him. Nobody else on board.\"\n\nTrigger lay back and looked at him. \"This is going to sound pretty odd!\"\nshe warned him. Then she told him what Repulsive had done and what he\nwas trying to do.\n\nThe Commissioner looked badly shaken.\n\n\"You sure of that, Trigger?\"\n\n\"Sure, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Trying to talk to you?\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\nHe blinked at her. \"I looked in the bag, and the thing was gone.\"\n\n\"Lyad knows it was gone,\" Trigger said. \"So in case she gets a chance to\nblab to someone, we'll say you had it.\"\n\nHe nodded and stood up. \"You stay here,\" he said. \"Prescription for the\nkind of treatment you've had is a day of bed rest.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"I'm going to go talk to that Psychology ship,\" he said. \"And just let\n'em try to stall me this time!\"\n\nHe went off up the passage toward the transmitter cabinet in the forward\npart of the ship. Some minutes passed. Then Trigger suddenly heard\nCommissioner Tate's voice raised in great wrath. She listened. It\nappeared the Psychology Service had got off on the wrong foot by\nadvising him once more to stay calm.\n\nHe came back presently and sat down beside the bunk, still a little red\nin the face. \"They're going to follow us,\" he said. \"If they hadn't, I\nwould have turned back and gunned our way on board that lopsided\ndisgrace of theirs.\"\n\n\"Follow us? Where?\"\n\nHe grunted. \"A place called Luscious. We'll be there in under a week.\nIt'll take them about three. But they're starting immediately.\"\n\nTrigger blinked. \"Looks like the plasmoids have made it to the head of\nthe problem list!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised,\" said the Commissioner. \"I was put through to\nthat Pilch after a while. She said to remind you to listen to your\nthinking whenever you can get around to it. Know what she meant?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I do,\" Trigger said hesitantly. \"But she's mentioned it.\nI'll give it a whirl. Why are we going to Luscious?\"\n\n\"Selan's Fleet found plasmoids on it. It's in the Vishni area.\"\n\n\"What kind of plasmoids?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"They don't amount to much, from what I heard. Small stuff.\nBut definitely plasmoid. It looks like somebody might have done some\nexperimenting there for a while. And not long ago.\"\n\n\"Did they find the big one?\"\n\n\"Not yet. No trace of any people on Luscious either.\" He chewed his lip\nthoughtfully for a moment. \"About an hour after we picked you and Lyad\nup,\" he said, \"we had a Council Order transmitted to the ship. Told us\nto swing off course a bit and rendezvous with a fast courier boat of\ntheirs.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"The order said the courier was to take Lyad on board and head for the\nHub with her. Some diplomatic business.\" He scratched his chin. \"It also\ninstructed us to treat the First Lady of Tranest with the courtesy due\nto her station meanwhile.\"\n\n\"Brother!\" Trigger said, outraged.\n\n\"Just too bad I couldn't read that message,\" said Holati Tate. \"Some\ngravitic disturbance! Rendezvous point's hours behind us. They'll never\ncatch up.\"\n\n\"Ho-ho!\" said Trigger. \"But that's being pretty insubordinate, Holati!\"\n\n\"It was till just now,\" he said. \"I mentioned that we had Lyad on board\nto that Pilch person. She said she'd speak to the Council. We're to hang\non to Lyad and when Pilch gets to Luscious she'll interview her.\"\n\nTrigger grinned. \"Now that,\" she remarked, \"gives me a feeling of great\nsatisfaction, somehow. When Pilch gets her little mitts on someone,\nthere isn't much left out.\"\n\n\"I had that impression. Meanwhile, we'll put the Ermetyne through a\nroutine questioning ourselves when she gets over being groggy. Courtesy\nwill be on the moderate side. She'll probably spill part of what she\nknows, especially if you sit there and hand her the beady stare from\ntime to time.\"\n\n\"That,\" Trigger assured him, \"will be hardly an effort at all!\"\n\n\"I can imagine. You're pretty sure that thing will show up again?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Just leave the handbag with me.\"\n\n\"All right.\" He stood up. \"I've got a hot lunch prepared for you. I'll\nbring the bag along. Then you can tell me what happened after they\ngrabbed you.\"\n\n\"How did you find out I was gone?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Your fac,\" he said. \"The girl was darn good actually. I talked to\nyou--her--on office transmitter once and didn't spot a sour note. Mostly\nshe just kept out of everybody's way. Very slick at it! We would have\ngot her fairly fast because we were preparing for take-off to Luscious\nby then. But she spilled it herself.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I located her finally again, on transmitter screen. There was no one on\nher side to impress. She took a sniff of porgee.\"\n\nTrigger laughed delightedly. \"Good old porgee pouch! It beat them twice.\nBut how did you know where I was?\"\n\n\"No problem there. We knew Lyad had strings on Pluly. Quillan knew about\nthat sealed level on Pluly's yacht and got Pluly to invite him over to\nadmire the harem right after the Dawn City arrived. While he was\nadmiring, he was also recording floor patterns for a subtub jump. That\ngimmick's pretty much of a spilled secret now, but on a swap for you and\nLyad it was worth it. We came aboard five minutes after we'd nabbed your\nfac.\"\n\n\"The Ermetyne figured you'd go chasing after the Aurora,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"Well,\" the Commissioner said tolerantly, \"the Ermetyne's pretty young.\nThe Aurora was a bit obvious.\"\n\n\"How come Quillan didn't start wondering when I didn't show up in\nMantelish's lab with Repulsive?\"\n\n\"So that's what he was for!\" Holati said. He rubbed the side of his jaw.\n\"I was curious about that angle! That wasn't Quillan. That was Quillan's\nfac.\"\n\n\"In Mantelish's lab?\" Trigger said, startled.\n\n\"Sure. That's how they all got in. In those specimen crates Mantelish\nhas been lugging into the dome the past couple of days. It looks like\nthe prof's been hypnotized up to his ears for months.\"\n\nThe last five hours of her day of recuperative rest Trigger spent\nasleep, her cabin door locked and the plasmoid purse open on the bunk\nbeside her. Holati had come by just before to report that the Ermetyne\nwas now awake but very groggy, apparently more than a little shocked,\nand not yet quite able to believe she was still alive. He'd dose her\nwith this and that, and interrogations would be postponed until\neverybody was on their feet.\n\nWhen Trigger woke up from her five hour nap, the purse was shut. She\nopened it and looked inside. Repulsive was down there, quietly curled\nup.\n\n\"Smart little bugger, aren't you?\" she said, not entirely with approval.\nThen she reached in and gave him a pat. She locked the purse, got\ndressed and went up to the front of the ship, carrying Repulsive along.\n\nAll four of the others were up in the lounge area which included the\npartitioned control section. The partition had been slid into the wall\nand the Commissioner, who was at the controls at the moment, had swung\nhis seat half around toward the lounge.\n\nHe glanced at the plasmoid purse as Trigger came in, grinned and gave\nher a small wink.\n\n\"Come in and sit down,\" he said. \"We've been waiting for you.\"\n\nTrigger sat down and looked at them. Something apparently had been going\non. Quillan's tanned face was thoughtful, perhaps a trifle amused.\nMantelish looked very red and angry. His shock of white hair was wildly\nrumpled. The Ermetyne appeared a bit wilted.\n\n\"What's been going on?\" Trigger asked.\n\nIt was the wrong question. Mantelish took a deep breath and began\nbellowing like a wounded thunder-ork. Trigger listened, with some\nadmiration. It was one of the best jobs of well-verbalized huffing she'd\nheard, even from the professor. He ran down in less than five minutes,\nthough--apparently he'd already let off considerable steam.\n\nLyad had dehypnotized him, at the Commissioner's suggestion. It had been\na lengthy job, requiring a couple of hours, but it was a complete one.\nWhich was understandable, since it was the First Lady herself, Trigger\ngathered gradually from the noise, who had put Mantelish under the\ninfluence, back in his own garden on Maccadon, and within two weeks\nafter his first return from Harvest Moon.\n\nIt was again Lyad who had given Mantelish his call to bemused duty via a\ntransmitted verbal cue on her arrival in Manon, and instructed him to\nget lost from his League guards for a few hours in Manon's swamps. There\nshe had met and conferred with him and pumped him of all he could tell\nher. As the final outrage, she had instructed him to lug her crated\ncohorts, preserved like Pluly's harem ladies, into the Precol dome--to\ncare for them tenderly there and at the proper cued moment to release\nthem for action--all under the illusion that they were priceless\nbiological specimens!\n\nMantelish wasn't in the least appeased by the fact that--again at the\nCommissioner's suggestion--Lyad had installed one minor new\nhypno-command which, she said, would clear up permanently his tendency\ntoward attacks of dive sickness. But he just ran down finally and sat\nthere, glowering at the Ermetyne now and then.\n\n\"Well,\" the Commissioner remarked, \"this might be as good a time as any\nto ask a few questions. Got your little quizzer with you, Quillan?\"\n\nQuillan nodded. Lyad looked at both of them in turn and then, briefly\nand for the first time, glanced in Trigger's direction.\n\nIt wasn't exactly an appealing glance. It might have been a questioning\none. And Trigger discovered suddenly that she felt just a little\nsympathy for Lyad. Lyad had lost out on a very big gamble. And, each in\nhis own way, there were three very formidable males among whom she was\nsitting. None of them was friendly; two were oversized, and the\nundersized one had a fairly bloodchilling record for anyone on the wrong\nside of law and order. Trigger decided to forget about beady stares for\nthe moment.\n\n\"Cheer up, Lyad!\" she said. \"Nobody's going to hurt you. Just give 'em\nthe answers!\"\n\nShe got another glance. Not a grateful one, exactly. Not an ungrateful\none either. Temporary support had been acknowledged.\n\n\"Commissioner Tate has informed me,\" the Ermetyne said, \"that this group\ndoes not recognize the principle of diplomatic immunity in my case.\nUnder the circumstances I must accept that. And so I shall answer any\nquestions I can.\" She looked at the pocket quizzer Quillan was checking\nover unhurriedly. \"But such verification instruments are of no use in\nquestioning me.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Quillan asked idly.\n\n\"I've been conditioned against them, of course,\" Lyad said. \"I'm an\nErmetyne of Tranest. By the time I was twelve years old, that toy of\nyours couldn't have registered a reaction from me that I didn't want it\nto show.\"\n\nQuillan slipped the toy back in his pocket.\n\n\"True enough, First Lady,\" he said. \"And that's one small strike in your\nfavor. We thought you might try to gimmick the gadget. Now we'll just\npitch you some questions. A recorder's on. Don't stall on the answers.\"\n\n\nAnd he and the Commissioner started flipping out questions. The Ermetyne\nflipped back the answers. So far as Trigger could tell, there wasn't any\nstalling. Or any time for it.\n\nAzol: Doctor Azol had been her boy from the start. He was now on\nTranest. The main item in his report to her had been the significance of\nthe 112-113 plasmoid unit. He'd also reported that Trigger Argee had\nbecome unconscious on Harvest Moon. They'd considered the possibility\nthat somebody was controlling Trigger Argee, or attempting to control\nher, because of her connections with the plasmoid operations.\n\nGess Fayle: Lyad had been looking for Doctor Fayle as earnestly as\neveryone else after his disappearance. She had not been able to buy him.\nSo far as she knew, nobody had been able to buy him. Doctor Fayle had\nappeared to intend to work for himself. He was at present well outside\nthe Hub's area of space. He still had 112-113 with him. Yes, she could\nbecome more specific about the location--with the help of star maps.\n\n\"Let's get them out,\" said Commissioner Tate.\n\nThey got them out. The Ermetyne presently circled a largish section of\nthe Vishni Fleet's area. The questions began again.\n\n113-A: Professor Mantelish had told her of his experiments with this\nplasmoid--\n\nThere was an interruption here while Mantelish huffed reflexively. But\nit was very brief. The professor wanted to learn more about the First\nLady's depravities himself.\n\n--and its various possible associations with the main unit. But by the\ntime this information became available to her, 113-A had been placed\nunder heavy guard. Professor Mantelish had made one attempt to smuggle\nit out to her.\n\nHuff-huff!\n\n--but had been unable to walk past the guards with it. Tranest agents\nhad made several unsuccessful attempts to pick up the plasmoid. She knew\nthat another group had made similarly unsuccessful attempts. The\nDevagas. She did not yet know the specific nature of 113-A's importance.\nBut it was important.\n\nTrigger: Trigger Argee might be able to tell them why Trigger was\nimportant. Doctor Fayle certainly could. So could the top ranks of the\nDevagas hierarchy. Lyad, at the moment, could not. She did know that\nTrigger Argee's importance was associated directly with that of plasmoid\n113-A. This information had been obtained from a Devagas operator, now\ndead. Not Balmordan. The operator had been in charge of the attempted\npickup on Evalee. The much more elaborate affair at the Colonial School\nhad been a Tranest job. A Devagas group had made attempts to interfere\nwith it, but had been disposed of.\n\nPluly: Lyad had strings on Belchik. He was afraid of the Devagas but\nsomewhat more terrified of her. His fear of the Devagas was due to the\nfact that he and an associate had provided the hierarchy with a very\nlarge quantity of contraband materials. The nature of the materials\nindicated the Devagas were constructing a major fortified outpost on a\nworld either airless or with poisonous atmosphere. Pluly's associate had\nsince been murdered. Pluly believed he was next in line to be silenced.\n\nBalmordan: Balmordan had been a rather high-ranking Devagas Intelligence\nagent. Lyad had heard of him only recently. He had been in charge of the\nattempts to obtain 113-A. Lyad had convinced him that she would make a\nvery dangerous competitor in the Manon area. She also had made\ninformation regarding her activities there available to him. So\nBalmordan and a select group of his gunmen had attended Pluly's party on\nPluly's yacht. They had been allowed to force their way into the sealed\nlevel and were there caught in a black-light trap. The gunmen had been\nkilled. Balmordan had been questioned.\n\nThe questioning revealed that the Devagas had found Doctor Fayle and the\n112-113 unit, almost immediately after Fayle's disappearance. They had\nsucceeded in creating some working plasmoids. To go into satisfactory\noperation, they still needed 113-A. Balmordan had not known why. But\nthey no longer needed Trigger Argee. Trigger Argee was now to be\ndestroyed at the earliest opportunity. Again Balmordan had not known\nwhy. Fayle and his unit were in the fortress dome the Devagas had been\nbuilding. It was in the area Lyad had indicated. It was supposed to be\nvery thoroughly concealed. Balmordan might or might not have known its\nexact coordinates. His investigators made the inevitable slip finally\nand triggered a violent mind-block reaction. Balmordan had died.\nDead-braining him had produced no further relevant information.\n\nThe little drumfire of questions ended abruptly. Trigger glanced at her\nwatch. It had been going on for only fifteen minutes, but she felt\nsomewhat dizzy by now. The Ermetyne just looked a little more wilted.\n\nAfter a minute, Commissioner Tate inquired politely whether there was\nany further information the First Lady could think of to give them at\nthis time.\n\nShe shook her head. No.\n\nOnly Professor Mantelish believed her.\n\nBut the interrogation was over, apparently.\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nQuillan took over the ship controls, and the Commissioner and Trigger\nwent with the recorder into the little office back of the transmitter\ncabinet, to slam out some fast reports to the Hub and other points. Lyad\nwas apologizing profoundly to Mantelish as they left the lounge. The\nprofessor was huffing back at her, rather mildly.\n\nA little while later, Lyad, showing indications of restrained surprise,\nwas helping Trigger prepare dinner. They took it into the lounge.\nQuillan remained at the controls while the others started eating.\nTrigger fixed up a tray and brought it to him.\n\n\"Thanks for the rescue, Major!\" she said.\n\nHe grinned up at her. \"It was a pleasure.\"\n\nTrigger glanced back at the little group in the lounge. \"Think she was\nfibbing a bit?\"\n\n\"Sure. Mainly she'd decided in advance how much to tell and how much\nnot. She thinks fast in action though! No slips. What she told of what\nshe knows makes a solid story, and with angles we can check on fast. So\nit's bound to have plenty of information in it. It'll do for the\nmoment.\"\n\n\"She's already started buttering up Mantelish,\" said Trigger.\n\n\"She'll do that,\" Quillan said. \"By the time we reach Luscious, the prof\nprobably might as well be back in the trances. The Commissioner intends\nto give her a little rope, I think.\"\n\n\"How close is Luscious to that area she showed?\"\n\nQuillan flicked on their course screen and superimposed the map Lyad had\nmarked. \"Red dot's well inside,\" he pointed out. \"That bit was probably\nquite solid info.\" He looked up at her. \"Did it bother you much to hear\nthe Devagas have dropped the grab idea and are out to do you in?\"\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"Not really,\" she said. \"Wouldn't make much\ndifference one way or the other, would it?\"\n\n\"Very little.\" He patted her hand. \"Well, they're not going to get you,\ndoll--one way _or_ the other!\"\n\nTrigger smiled. \"I believe you,\" she said. \"Thanks.\" She looked back\ninto the lounge again. Just at present she did have a feeling of\nrelaxed, unconcerned security. It probably wasn't going to last, though.\nShe glanced at Quillan.\n\n\"Those computers of yours,\" she said. \"What did they have to say about\nthat not-catassin you squashed?\"\n\n\"The crazy things claim now it was a plasmoid,\" Quillan said, \"Revolting\nnotion! But it makes some sense for once. Checks with some of the things\nLyad just told us, too. Do you remember that Vethi sponge Balmordan was\ncarrying?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It didn't come off the ship with him. He checked it out as having died\nen route.\"\n\n\"That is a revolting notion!\" Trigger said after a moment. \"Well, at\nleast we've got detectors now.\"\n\nBut the feeling of security had faded somewhat again.\n\nBefore dinner was half over, the long-range transmitters abruptly came\nto life. For the next thirty minutes or so, messages rattled in\nincessantly, as assorted Headquarters here and there reacted to the\nErmetyne's report. The Commissioner sat in the little office and sorted\nover the incoming information. Trigger stayed at the transmitters,\nfeeding it to him as it arrived. None of it affected them directly--they\nwere already headed for the point in space a great many other people\nwould now start heading for very soon.\n\nThen business dropped off again almost as suddenly as it had picked up.\nA half dozen low priority items straggled in, in as many minutes. The\ntransmitters purred idly. Then the person-to-person buzzer sounded.\n\nTrigger punched the screen button. A voice pronounced the ship's dial\nnumber.\n\n\"Acknowledging,\" Trigger said. \"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Orado ComWeb Center,\" said the voice. \"Stand by for contact with\nFederation Councilman Roadgear.\"\n\nTrigger whacked the panic button. Roadgear was a NAME! \"Standing by,\"\nshe said.\n\nCommissioner Tate came in through the door and slipped into the chair\nshe'd already vacated. Trigger took another seat a few feet away. She\nfelt a little nervous, but she'd always wanted to see a high-powered\ndiplomat in action.\n\nThe screen lit up. She recognized Roadgear from his pics. Tall,\nfine-looking man of the silvered sideburns type. He was in an armchair\nin a very plush office.\n\n\"Congratulations, Commissioner!\" he said, smiling. \"I believe you're\naware by now that your latest report has set many wheels spinning\nrapidly!\"\n\n\"I rather expected it would,\" the Commissioner admitted. He also smiled.\n\nThey pitched it back and forth a few times, very chummy. Roadgear didn't\nappear to be involved in any specific way with the operations which soon\nwould center about Luscious. Trigger began to wonder what he was after.\n\n\"A few of us are rather curious to know,\" Roadgear said, \"why you didn't\nacknowledge the last Council Order sent you.\"\n\nTrigger didn't quite start nervously.\n\n\"When was this?\" asked the Commissioner.\n\nRoadgear smiled softly and told him.\n\n\"Got a record here of some scrambled item that arrived about then,\" the\nCommissioner said. \"Very good of you to call me about it, Councilman.\nWhat was the order content?\"\n\n\"It's dated now, as it happens,\" Roadgear said. \"Actually I'm calling\nabout another matter. The First Lady of Tranest appears to have been\nvery obliging about informing you of some of her recent activities.\"\n\nThe Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, very obliging.\"\n\n\"And in so short a time after her, ah, detainment. You must have been\nvery persuasive?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Holati Tate said, \"no more than usually.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Councilman Roadgear. \"Now there's been some slight concern\nexpressed by some members of the Council--well, let's say they'd just\nlike to be reassured that the amenities one observes in dealing with a\nhead of state actually are being observed in this case. I'm sure they\nare, of course.\"\n\nThe Commissioner was silent a moment. \"I was informed a while ago,\" he\nsaid, \"that full responsibility for this Head of State has been assigned\nto my group. Is that correct?\"\n\nThe Councilman reddened very slightly. \"Quite,\" he said. \"The official\nCouncil Order should reach you in a day or so.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the Commissioner, \"I'll assure you and you can assure\nthe Councilmen who were feeling concerned that the amenities are being\nobserved. Then everybody can relax again. Is that all right?\"\n\n\"No, not quite,\" Roadgear said annoyedly. \"In fact, the Councilmen\nwould very much prefer it, Commissioner, if I were given an opportunity\nto speak to the First Lady directly to reassure myself on the point.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Commissioner Tate said, \"she can't come to the transmitters\nright now. She's washing the dishes.\"\n\nThe Councilman reddened very considerably this time. He stared at the\nCommissioner a moment longer. Then he said in a very soft voice, \"Oh,\nthe hell with it!\" He added, \"Good luck, Commissioner--you're going to\nneed it some time.\"\n\nThe screen went blank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe scouts of Selan's Independent Fleet, who had first looked this\nplanet over and decided to call it Luscious, had selected a name,\nTrigger thought, which probably would stick. Because that was what it\nwas, at least in the area where they were camping.\n\nShe rolled over from her side to her face and gave herself a push away\nfrom the rock she'd been regarding contemplatively for the past few\nminutes. Feet first, she went drifting out into a somewhat deeper\nsection of Plasmoid Creek.\n\nNone of it was very deep. There were pools here and there, in the\nstretch of the creek she usually came to, where she could stand on her\ntoes in the warm clear water and, arms stretched straight up, barely\ntickle the surface with her finger tips. But along most of the stretch\nthe bigger rocks weren't even submerged.\n\nShe came sliding over the sand to another rock, turned on her back and\nleaned up against the rock, blinking at sun reflections along the water.\nCamp was a couple of hundred yards down the valley, its sounds cut off\nby a rise of the ground. The Commissioner's ship was there, plus a half\ndozen tents, plus a sizable I-Fleet unit with lab facilities which\nSelan's outfit had loaned Mantelish for the duration. There were some\nfifteen, twenty people in all about the camp at the moment. They knew\nshe was loafing around in the water up here and wouldn't disturb her.\n\nStrictly speaking, of course, she wasn't loafing. She was learning how\nto listen to herself think. She didn't feel she was getting the knack of\nit too quickly; but it was coming. The best way seemed to be to let go\nmentally as much as possible; to wait without impatience, really to\nmore-or-less listen quietly within yourself, as if you were looking\naround in some strange forest, letting whatever wanted to come to view\ncome, and fade again, as something else rose to view instead. The main\ndifficulty was with the business of relaxing mentally, which wasn't at\nall her natural method of approaching a problem.\n\nBut when she could do it, information of a kind that was beginning to\nlook very interesting was likely to come filtering into her awareness.\nWhatever was at work deep in her mind--and she could give a pretty fair\nguess at what it was now--seemed as weak and slow as the Psychology\nService people had indicated. The traces of its work were usually faint\nand vague. But gradually the traces were forming into some very definite\npictures.\n\nLazing around in the waters of Plasmoid Creek for an hour or so every\nmorning had turned out to be a helpful part of the process. On the\nflashing, all-out run to Luscious, subspace all the way, with the\nCommissioner and Quillan spelling each other around the clock at the\ncontrols, the transmitters clattering for attention every half hour, the\nship's housekeeping had to be handled, and somebody besides Mantelish\nneeded to keep a moderately beady eye on the Ermetyne, she hadn't even\nthought of acting on Pilch's suggestion.\n\nBut once they'd landed, there suddenly wasn't much to keep her busy, and\nshe could shift priority to listening to herself think. It was one of\nthose interim periods where everything was being prepared and nothing\nhad got started. As a plasmoid planet, Luscious was pretty much of a\nbust. It was true that plasmoids were here. It was also true that until\nfairly recently plasmoids were being produced here.\n\nBy the simple method of looking where they were thickest, Selan's people\neven had located the plasmoid which had been producing the others,\nseveral days before Mantelish arrived to confirm their find. This one,\nby the plasmoid standards of Luscious, was a regular monster, some\ntwenty-five inches high; a gray, mummylike thing, dead and half rotted\ninside. It was the first plasmoid--with the possible exception of\nwhatever had flattened itself out on Quillan's gravity mine--known to\nhave died. There had been very considerable excitement when it was first\ndiscovered, because the description made it sound very much as if they'd\nfinally located 112-113.\n\nThey hadn't. This one--if Trigger had followed Mantelish\ncorrectly--could be regarded as a cheap imitation of 112. And its\nproductions, compared with the working plastic life of Harvest Moon,\nappeared to be strictly on a kindergarten level: nuts and bolts and less\nthan that. To Trigger, most of the ones that had been collected looked\nlike assorted bugs and worms, though one at least was the size of a\nsmall pig.\n\n\"No form, no pattern,\" Mantelish rumbled. \"Was the thing practicing? Did\nit attempt to construct an assistant and set it down here to test it?\nWell, now!\" He went off again to incomprehensibilities, apparently no\nlonger entirely dissatisfied. \"Get me 112!\" he bellowed. \"Then this\nbusiness will be solved! Meanwhile we now at least have plasmoid\nmaterial to waste. We can experiment boldly! Come, Lyad, my dear.\"\n\nAnd Lyad followed him into the lab unit, where they went to work again,\ndissecting, burning, stimulating, inoculating and so forth great numbers\nof more or less pancake-sized subplasmoids.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis morning Trigger wasn't getting down to the best semidrowsy level at\nall readily. And it might very well be that Lyad-my-dear business. \"You\nknow,\" she had told the Commissioner thoughtfully the day before, \"by\nthe time we're done, Lyad will know more about plasmoids than anyone in\nthe Hub except Mantelish!\"\n\nHe didn't look concerned. \"Won't matter much. By the time we're done,\nshe and the rest of the Ermetynes will have had to cough up control of\nTranest. They've broken treaty with this business.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Trigger said. \"Does Lyad know that?\"\n\n\"Sure. She also knows she's getting off easy. If she were a Federation\ncitizen, she'd be up for compulsory rehabilitation right now.\"\n\n\"She'll try something if she gets half a chance!\" Trigger warned.\n\n\"She sure will!\" the Commissioner said absently. He went on with his\nwork.\n\nIt didn't seem to be Lyad that was bothering. Trigger lay flat on her\nback in the shallow sand bar, arms behind her head, feeling the sun's\nwarmth on her closed eyelids. She watched her thoughts drifting by\nslowly.\n\nIt just might be Quillan.\n\nOle Major Quillan. The rescuer in time of need. The not-catassin\nsmasher. Quite a guy. The water murmured past her.\n\nOn the ride out here they'd run by one another now and then, going from\njob to job. After they'd arrived, Quillan was gone three quarters of the\ntime, helping out in the hunt for the concealed Devagas fortress. It was\nstill concealed; they hadn't yet picked up a trace.\n\nBut every so often he made it back to camp. And every so often when he\nwas back in camp and didn't think she was looking, he'd be sitting there\nlooking at her.\n\nTrigger grinned happily. Ole Major Quillan--being bashful! Well now!\n\nAnd that did it. She could feel herself relaxing, slipping down and\naway, drifting down through her mind ... farther ... deeper ... toward\nthe tiny voice that spoke in such a strange language and still was\nbecoming daily more comprehensible.\n\n\"Uh, say, Trigger!\"\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nTrigger gasped. Her eyes flew open. She made a convulsive effort to\nvanish beneath the surface of the creek. Being flat on the sand as it\nwas, that didn't work. So she stopped splashing about and made rapid\ncovering-up motions here and there instead.\n\n\"You've got a nerve!\" she snapped as her breath came back. \"Beat it!\nFast!\"\n\nOle bashful Quillan, standing on the bank fifteen feet above her, looked\nhurt. He also looked.\n\n\"Look!\" he said plaintively. \"I just came over to make sure you were all\nright--wild animals around! I wasn't studying the color scheme.\"\n\n\"_Beat it! At once!_\"\n\nQuillan inhaled with apparent difficulty.\n\n\"Though now it's been mentioned,\" he went on, speaking rapidly and\nunevenly, \"there _is_ all that brown and that sort of pink and that lovely\nwhite.\" He was getting more enthusiastic by the moment; Trigger became\nafraid he would fall off the bank and land in the creek beside her. \"And\nthe--ooh-ummh!--wet red hair and the freckles!\" he rattled along, his\neyes starting out of his head. \"And the lovely--\"\n\n\"Quillan!\" she yelled. \"Please!\"\n\nQuillan checked himself. \"Uh!\" he said. He drew a deep breath. The wild\nlook faded. Sanity appeared to return. \"Well, it's the truth about those\nwild animals! Some sort of large, uncouth critter was observed just now\nducking into the forest at the upper end of the valley!\"\n\nTrigger darted a glance along the bank. Her clothes were forty feet\naway, just beside the water.\n\n\"I'm observing some sort of large, uncouth critter right here!\" she said\ncoldly. \"What's worse, it's observing me. Turn around!\"\n\nQuillan sighed. \"You're a hard woman, Argee,\" he said. But he turned. He\nwas carrying a holstered gun, as a matter of fact; but he usually did\nthat nowadays anyway. \"This thing,\" he went on, \"is supposed to have a\nhead like a bat, three feet across. It flies.\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" Trigger told him. She decided he wasn't going to\nturn around again. \"So now I'll just get into my clothes, and then--\"\n\nIt came quietly out of the trees around the upper bend of the creek\nsixty feet away. It had a head like a bat, and was blue on top and\nyellow below. Its flopping wing tips barely cleared the bank on either\nside. The three-foot mouth was wide open, showing very long thin white\nteeth. It came skimming swiftly over the surface of the water toward\nher.\n\n\"Quiiii-LLAN!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey walked back along the trail to camp. Trigger walked a few steps\nahead, her back very straight. The worst of it had been the smug look on\nhis face.\n\n\"Heel!\" she observed. \"Heel! Heel! Heel!\"\n\n\"Now, Trigger,\" Quillan said calmly behind her. \"After all, it was you\nwho came flying up the bank and wrapped yourself around my neck. All\nwet, too.\"\n\n\"I was scared!\" Trigger snarled. \"Who wouldn't be? You certainly didn't\nhesitate an instant to take full advantage of the situation!\"\n\n\"True,\" Quillan admitted. \"I'd dropped the bat. There you were. Who'd\nhesitate? I'm not out of my mind.\"\n\nShe did two dance steps of pure rage and spun to face him. She put her\nhands on her hips. Quillan stopped warily.\n\n\"Your mind!\" she said. \"I'd hate to have one like it. What do you think\nI am? One of Belchik's houris?\"\n\nFor a man his size, he was really extremely quick. Before she could\nmove, he was there, one big arm wrapped about her shoulders, pinning her\narms to her sides. \"Easy, Trigger!\" he said softly.\n\nWell, others had tried to hold her like that when she didn't want to be\nheld. A twist, a jerk, a heave--and over and down they went. Trigger\nbraced herself quietly. If she was quick enough now---- She twisted,\njerked, heaved. She stopped, discouraged. The situation hadn't altered\nappreciably.\n\nShe _had_ been afraid it wasn't going to work with Quillan.\n\n\"Let go!\" she said furiously, aiming a fast heel at his instep. But the\ninstep flicked aside. Her shoe dug into the turf of the path. The ape\nmight even have an extra pair of eyes on his feet!\n\nThen his free palm was cupped under her chin, tilting it carefully. His\nother eyes appeared above hers. Very close. Very dark.\n\n\"I'll bite!\" Trigger whispered fiercely. \"I'll bi--mmph!\n\n\"Mmmph--grrmm!\n\n\"Grr-mm-mhm.... Hm-m-m ... mhm!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey walked on along the trail, hand in hand. They came up over the last\nlittle rise. Trigger looked down on the camp. She frowned.\n\n\"Pretty dull!\" she observed.\n\n\"Eh?\" Quillan asked, startled.\n\n\"Not that, ape!\" she said. She squeezed his hand. \"Your morals aren't\ngood, but dull it wasn't. I meant generally. We're just sitting here now\nwaiting. Nothing seems to be happening.\"\n\nIt was true, at least on the surface. There were a great number of ships\nand men around and near Luscious, but they weren't in view. They were\nready to jump in any direction, at any moment, but they had nothing to\njump at yet. The Commissioner's transmitters hadn't signaled more than\ntwo or three times in the last two days. Even the short communicators\nremained mostly silent.\n\n\"Cheer up, Doll!\" Quillan said. \"Something's bound to break pretty\nsoon.\"\n\nThat evening, a Devagas ship came zooming in on Luscious.\n\nThey were prepared for it, of course. That somebody came round from time\nto time to look over the local plasmoid crop was only to be expected. As\nthe ship surfaced in atmosphere on the other side of the planet, four\none-man Scout fighters flashed in on it from four points of the horizon,\nradiation screens up. They tacked holding beams on it and braced\nthemselves. A Federation destroyer appeared in the air above it.\n\nThe Devagas ship couldn't escape. So it blew itself up.\n\nThey were prepared for that, too. The Devagas pilot was being\ndead-brained three minutes later. He didn't know a significant thing\nexcept the exact coordinates of an armed, subterranean Devagas dome,\nthree days' run away.\n\nThe Scout ships that had been hunting for the dome went howling in\ntoward it from every direction. The more massive naval vessels of the\nFederation followed behind. There was no hurry for the heavies. The\ncaptured Devagas ship's attempt to beam a warning to its base had been\nsmothered without effort. The Scouts were getting in fast enough to\nblock escape attempts.\n\n\"And now we split forces,\" the Commissioner said. He was the only one,\nTrigger thought, who didn't seem too enormously excited by it all.\n\"Quillan, you and your group get going! They can use you there a whole\nlot better than we can here.\"\n\nFor just a second, Quillan looked like a man being dragged violently in\ntwo directions. He didn't look at Trigger. He asked, \"Think it's wise to\nleave you people unguarded?\"\n\n\"Quillan,\" said Commissioner Tate, \"that's the first time in my life\nanybody has suggested I need guarding.\"\n\n\"Sorry sir,\" said Quillan.\n\n\"You mean,\" Trigger said, \"we're not going? We're just staying here?\"\n\n\"You've got an appointment, remember?\" the Commissioner said.\n\nQuillan and company were gone within the hour. Mantelish, Holati Tate,\nLyad and Trigger stayed at camp.\n\nLuscious looked very lonely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It isn't just the king plasmoid they're hoping to catch there,\" the\nCommissioner told Trigger. \"And I wouldn't care, frankly, if the thing\nstayed lost the next few thousand years. But we had a very odd report\nlast week. The Federation's undercover boys have been scanning the\nDevagas worlds and Tranest very closely of late, naturally. The report\nis that there isn't the slightest evidence that a single one of the top\nmembers of the Devagas hierarchy has been on any of their worlds in the\npast two months.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"They think they're out here? In that dome?\"\n\n\"That's what's suspected.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nHe scratched his chin. \"If anyone knows, they haven't told me. It's\nprobably nothing nice.\"\n\nTrigger pondered. \"You'd think they'd use facsimiles,\" she said. \"Like\nLyad.\"\n\n\"Oh, they did,\" he said. \"They did. That's one of the reasons for being\npretty sure they're gone. They're nowhere near as expert at that\nfacsimile business as the Tranest characters. A little study of the\nrecordings showed the facs were just that.\"\n\nTrigger pondered again. \"Did they find anything on Tranest?\"\n\n\"Yes. One combat-strength squadron of those souped-up frigates of the\nAurora class they're allowed by treaty can't be accounted for.\"\n\nTrigger cupped her chin in her hands and looked at him. \"Is that why\nwe've stayed on Luscious, Holati--the four of us?\"\n\n\"It's one reason. That Repulsive thing of yours is another.\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"I have a pretty strong feeling,\" he said, \"that while they'll probably\nfind the hierarchy in that Devagas dome, they won't find the 112-113\nitem there.\"\n\n\"So Lyad still is gambling,\" Trigger said. \"And we're gambling we'll get\nmore out of her next play than she does.\" She hesitated. \"Holati--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"When did you decide it would be better if nobody ever got to see that\nking plasmoid again?\"\n\nHolati Tate said, \"About the time I saw the reconstruct of that yellow\nmonster of Balmordan's. Frankly, Trigger, there was a good deal of\ndiscussion of possibilities along that line before we decided to\nannounce the discovery of Harvest Moon. If we could have just kept it\nhidden away for a couple of centuries--until there was considerably more\ngood sense around the Hub--we probably would have done it. But somebody\nwas bound to run across it sometime. And the stuff did look as if it\nmight be extremely valuable. So we took the chance.\"\n\n\"And now you'd like to untake it?\"\n\n\"If it's still possible. Half the Fed Council probably would like to see\nit happen. But they don't even dare think along those lines. There could\nbe a blowup that would throw Hub politics back into the kind of snarl\nthey haven't been in for a hundred years. If anything is done, it will\nhave to look as if it had been something nobody could have helped. And\nthat still might be bad enough.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Holati--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Nothing. Or if it is, I'll ask you later.\" She\nstood up. \"I think I'll go have my swim.\"\n\nShe still went loafing in Plasmoid Creek in the mornings. The bat had\nbeen identified as an innocent victim of appearances, a very\nmild-mannered beast dedicated to the pursuit and engulfment of huge\nmothlike bugs which hung around watercourses. Luscious still looked like\nthe safest of all possible worlds for any creature as vigorous as a\nhuman being. But she kept the Denton near now, just in case.\n\nShe stretched out again in the sun-warmed water, selected a smooth rock\nto rest her head on, wriggled into the sand a little so the current\nwouldn't shift her, and closed her eyes. She lay still, breathing\nslowly. Contact was coming more easily and quickly every morning. But\nthe information which had begun to filter through in the last few days\nwasn't at all calculated to make one happy.\n\nShe was afraid now she was going to die in this thing. She had almost\nlet it slip out to Holati, which wouldn't have helped in the least.\nShe'd have to watch that in future.\n\nRepulsive hadn't exactly said she would die. He'd said, \"Maybe.\"\nRepulsive was scared too. Scared badly.\n\nTrigger lay quiet, her thoughts, her attention drifting softly inward\nand down. Creek water rippled against her cheek.\n\nIt was all because that one clock moved so slowly. That was the thing\nthat couldn't be changed. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nThree mornings later, the emergency signal called her back to camp on\nthe double.\n\nTrigger ran over the developments of the past days in her mind as she\ntrotted along the path, getting dressed more or less on the way. The\nDevagas dome was solidly invested by now, its transmitters blanked out.\nIt hadn't tried to communicate with its attackers. On their part, the\nFed ships weren't pushing the attack. They were holding the point,\nwaiting for the big, slow wrecking boats to arrive, which would very\ngently and delicately start uncovering and opening the dome, taking it\napart, piece by piece. The hierarchy could surrender themselves and\nwhatever they were hiding in there at any point in the process. They\ndidn't have a chance. Nobody and nothing had escaped. The Scouts had\nswatted down a few Devagas vessels on the way in; but those had been\nheaded toward the dome, not away from it.\n\nPerhaps the Psychology Service ship had arrived, several days ahead of\ntime.\n\nThe other three weren't in camp, but the lock to the Commissioner's ship\nstood open. Trigger went in and found them gathered up front. The\nCommissioner had swung the transmitter cabinet aside and was back there,\nprowling among the power leads.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Transmitters went out,\" he said. \"Don't know why yet. Grab some tools\nand help me check.\"\n\nShe slipped on her work gloves, grabbed some tools and joined him. Lyad\nand Mantelish watched them silently.\n\nThey found the first spots of the fungus a few minutes later.\n\n\"Fungus!\" Mantelish said, startled. He began to rumble in his pockets.\n\"My microscope--\"\n\n\"I have it.\" Lyad handed it to him. She looked at him with concern. \"You\ndon't think--\"\n\n\"It seems possible. We did come in here last night, remember? And we\ncame straight from the lab.\"\n\n\"But we had been decontaminated,\" Lyad said puzzledly.\n\n\"Don't try to walk in here, Professor!\" Trigger warned as he lumbered\nforward. \"We might have to de-electrocute you. The Commissioner will\nscrape off a sample and hand it out. This stuff--if it's what you think\nit might be--is poisonous?\"\n\n\"Quite harmless to life, my dear,\" said the professor, bending over the\npatch of greenish-gray scum the Commissioner had reached out to him.\n\"But ruinous in delicate instruments! That's why we're so careful.\"\n\nHolati Tate glanced at Trigger. \"Better look in the black box, Trig,\" he\nsaid.\n\nShe nodded and wormed herself farther into the innards of the\ntransmitters. A minute later she announced, \"Full of it! And that's the\none part we can't repair or replace, of course. Is it your beast,\nProfessor?\"\n\n\"It seems to be,\" Mantelish said unhappily. \"But we have, at least, a\nsolvent which will remove it from the equipment.\"\n\nTrigger came sliding out from under the transmitters, the detached black\nbox under one arm. \"Better use it then before the stuff gets to the rest\nof the ship. It won't help the black box.\" She shook it. It tinkled.\n\"Shot!\" she said. \"There went another quarter million of your credits,\nCommissioner.\"\n\nMantelish and Lyad headed for the lock to get the solvent. Trigger\nslipped off her work gloves and turned to follow them. \"Might be a while\nbefore I'm back,\" she said.\n\nThe Commissioner started to say something, then nodded and climbed back\ninto the transmitters. After a few minutes, Mantelish came puffing in\nwith sprayers and cans of solvent. \"It's at least fortunate you tried to\nput out a call just now,\" he said. \"It might have done incalculable\ndamage.\"\n\n\"Doubt it,\" said Holati. \"A few more instruments might have gone. Like\nthe communicators. The main equipment is fungus-proof. How do you\nattach this thing?\"\n\nMantelish showed him.\n\nThe Commissioner thanked him. He directed a fine spray of the solvent\ninto the black box and watched the fungus melt. \"Happen to notice where\nTrigger and Lyad went?\" he asked.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Mantelish. He reflected. \"I saw them walking down toward camp\ntalking together as I came in,\" he called. \"Should I go get them?\"\n\n\"Don't bother,\" Holati said. \"They'll be back.\"\n\nThey came walking back into the ship around half an hour later. Both\nfaces looked rather white and strained.\n\n\"Lyad has something she wants to tell you, Holati,\" Trigger said.\n\"Where's Mantelish?\"\n\n\"In his lab. Taking a nap, I believe.\"\n\n\"That's good. We don't want him here for this. Go ahead, Lyad. Just the\nimportant stuff. You can give us the details after we've left.\"\n\nThree hours later, the ship was well away from Luscious, traveling\nsubspace, traveling fast. Trigger walked up into the control section.\n\n\"Mantelish is still asleep,\" she said. They'd fed the professor a doped\ndrink to get him aboard without detailed explanation and argument about\nhow much of the lab should be loaded on the ship first. \"Shall I get\nLyad out of her cabin for the rest of the story or wait till he wakes\nup?\"\n\n\"Better wait,\" said the Commissioner. \"He'll come out of it in about an\nhour, and he might as well hear it with us. Looks like navigating's\ngoing to be a little rough for a spell anyway.\"\n\nTrigger nodded and sat down in the control next to his. After a while\nhe glanced over at her.\n\n\"How did you get her to talk?\" he asked.\n\n\"We went back into the woods a bit. I tied her over a stump and broke\ntwo sticks across the first seat of Tranest. Got the idea from Mihul\nsort of,\" Trigger added vaguely. \"When I picked up a third stick, Lyad\ngot awfully anxious to keep things at just a fast conversational level.\nWe kept it there.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said the Commissioner. \"You don't feel she did any lying this\ntime?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. I tapped her one now and then, just to make sure she didn't\nslow down enough to do much thinking. Besides I'd got the whole business\ndown on a pocket recorder, and Lyad knew it. If she makes one more goof\ntill this deal is over, the recording gets released to the Hub's news\nviewer outfits, yowls and all. She'd sooner lose Tranest than risk\nhaving that happen. She'll be good.\"\n\n\"Yeah, probably,\" he said thoughtfully. \"About that substation--would\nyou feel more comfortable if we went after the bunch round the Devagas\ndome first and got us an escort for the trip?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Trigger said. \"But that would just about kill any chances of\ndoing anything personally, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so. Scout Intelligence will go along pretty far with me. But\nthey couldn't go that far. We might be able to contact Quillan\nindividually though. He's a topnotch man in a fighter.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem to me,\" Trigger said, \"that we ought to run any risk of\nbeing spotted till we know exactly what this thing is like.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Commissioner, \"I'm with you there. We shouldn't.\"\n\n\"What about Mantelish and Lyad? You can't let them know either.\"\n\nThe Commissioner motioned with his head. \"The rest cubicle back of the\ncabins. If we see a chance to do anything, we'll pop them both into\nRest. I can dream up something to make that look plausible afterwards, I\nthink.\"\n\nTrigger was silent a moment. Lyad had told them she'd dispatched the\nAurora to stand guard over a subspace station where the missing king\nplasmoid presently was housed, until both she and the combat squadron\nfrom Tranest could arrive there. The exact location of that station had\nbeen the most valuable of the bits of information she had extracted so\npainstakingly from Balmordan. The coordinates were centered on the\nCommissioner's course screen at the moment.\n\n\"How about that Tranest squadron?\" Trigger asked. \"Think Lyad might have\nrisked a lie, and they could get out here in time to interfere?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Commissioner. \"She had to have some idea of where to send\nthem before starting them out of the Hub. They'll be doing fine if they\nmake it to the substation in another two weeks. Now the Aurora--if they\nstarted for Luscious right after Lyad called them last night, at best\nthey can't get there any sooner than we can get to the substation. I\nfigure that at four days. If they turn right around then, and start\nback--\"\n\nTrigger laughed. \"You can bet on that!\" she said. The Commissioner had\nused his ship's guns to brand the substation's coordinates in\ntwenty-mile figures into a mountain plateau above Plasmoid Creek. They'd\nleft much more detailed information in camp, but there was a chance it\nwould be overlooked in too hurried a search.\n\n\"Then they'll show up at the substation again four or five days behind\nus,\" the Commissioner said. \"So they're no problem. But our own outfit's\nfastest ships can cut across from the Devagas dome in less than three\ndays after their search party messages from Luscious to tell them why\nwe've stopped transmitting and where we've gone. Or the Psychology ship\nmight get to Luscious before the search party does and start\ntransmitting about the coordinates.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" said Trigger, \"it's our own boys who are likely to be the\nproblem.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'd say we _should_ have two days, give or take a few hours, after\nwe get to the station to see if we can do anything useful and get it\ndone. Of course, somebody might come wandering into Luscious right now\nand start wondering about those coordinate figures, or drop in at our\ncamp and discover we're gone. But that's not very likely, after all.\"\n\n\"Couldn't be helped anyway,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"No. If we knock ourselves out on this job, somebody besides Lyad's\nTranest squadron and the Devagas has to know just where the station is.\"\nHe shook his head. \"That Lyad! I figured she'd know how to run the\ntransmitters, so I gave her the chance. But I never imagined she'd be a\ngood enough engineer to get inside them and mess them up without killing\nherself.\"\n\n\"Lyad has her points,\" Trigger said. \"Too bad she grew up a rat. You had\na playback attachment stuck in there then?\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"Full of the fungus, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Full of it,\" said the Commissioner. \"Well, Lyad still lost on that\nmaneuver. Much less comfortably than she might have, too.\"\n\n\"I think she'd agree with you there,\" Trigger said.\n\nLyad's first assignment after Professor Mantelish came out of the dope\nwas to snap him back into trance and explain to him how he had once more\nbeen put under hypno control and used for her felonious ends by the\nFirst Lady of Tranest. They let him work off his rage while he was still\nunder partial control. Then the Ermetyne woke him up.\n\nHe stared at her coldly.\n\n\"You are a deceitful woman, Lyad Ermetyne!\" he declared. \"I don't wish\nto see you about my labs again! At any time. Under any pretext. Is that\nunderstood?\"\n\n\"Yes, Professor,\" Lyad said. \"And I'm sorry that I believed it necessary\nto--\"\n\nMantelish snorted. \"Sorry! Necessary! Just to be certain it doesn't\nhappen again, I shall make up a batch of antihypno pills. If I can\nremember the prescription.\"\n\n\"I happen,\" the Ermetyne ventured, \"to know a very good prescription for\nthe purpose, Professor. If you will permit me!\"\n\nMantelish stood up. \"I'll accept no prescriptions from you!\" he said\nicily. He looked at Trigger as he turned to walk out of the cabin. \"Or\ndrinks from you either, Trigger Argee!\" he growled. \"Who in the great\nspiraling galaxy is there left to trust!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Professor,\" Trigger said meekly.\n\nIn half an hour or so, he calmed down enough to join the others in the\nlounge, to get the final story on Gess Fayle and the missing king\nplasmoid from the Ermetyne.\n\nDoctor Gess Fayle, Lyad reported, had died very shortly after leaving\nthe Manon System. And with him had died every man on board the\nU-League's transport ship. It might be simplest, she went on, to relate\nthe first series of events from the plasmoid's point of view.\n\n\"Point of view?\" Professor Mantelish interrupted. \"The plasmoid has\nawareness then?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. That one does.\"\n\n\"Self-awareness?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"Oho! But then--\"\n\n\"Professor,\" Trigger interrupted politely in turn, \"may I get you a\ndrink?\"\n\nHe glared at her, growled, then grinned. \"I'll shut up,\" he said. Lyad\nwent on.\n\nDoctor Fayle had resumed experimentation with the 112-113 unit almost as\nsoon as he was alone with it; and one of the first things he did was to\ndetach the small 113 section from the main one. The point Doctor Fayle\nhadn't adequately considered when he took this step was that 113's\nfunction appeared to be that of a restraining, limiting or counteracting\ndevice on its vastly larger partner. The Old Galactics obviously had\nbeen aware of dangerous potentialities in their more advanced creations,\nand had used this means of regulating them. That the method was reliable\nwas indicated by the fact that, in the thirty thousand years since the\nOld Galactics had vanished, plasmoid 112 had remained restricted to the\noperations required for the maintenance of Harvest Moon.\n\nBut it hadn't liked being restricted.\n\nAnd it had been very much aware of the possibilities offered by the new\nlife-forms which lately had intruded on Harvest Moon.\n\nThe instant it found itself free, it attempted to take control of the\nhuman minds in its environment.\n\n\"Mind-level control?\" Mantelish exclaimed, looking startled. \"Not\nunheard-of, of course. And we'd been considering.... But of _human_\nminds?\"\n\nLyad nodded. \"It can contact human minds,\" she said, \"though, perhaps\nrather fortunately, it can project that particular field effect only\nwithin a quite limited radius. A little less, the Devagas found later,\nthan five miles.\"\n\nMantelish shook his head, frowning. He turned toward the Commissioner.\n\"Holati,\" he said emphatically, \"I believe that thing could be\ndangerous!\"\n\nFor a moment, they all looked at him. Then the Commissioner cleared his\nthroat. \"It's a possibility, Mantelish,\" he admitted. \"We will give it\nthought later.\"\n\n\"What,\" Trigger asked Lyad, \"killed the people on the ship?\"\n\n\"The attempt to control them,\" Lyad said. Doctor Fayle apparently had\ndied as he was leaving the laboratory with the 113 unit. The other men\ndied wherever they were. The ship, running subspace and pilotless,\nplowed headlong into the next gravitic twister and broke up.\n\nA Devagas ship's detectors picked up the wreckage three days later.\nBalmordan was on board the Devagas ship and in charge.\n\nThe Devagas, at that time, were at least as plasmoid-hungry as anybody\nelse, and knew they were not likely to see their hunger gratified for\nseveral decades. The wreck of a U-League ship in the Manon area\ndecidedly was worth investigating.\n\nIf the big plasmoid hadn't been capable of learning from its mistakes,\nthe Devagas investigating party also would have died. Since it could and\ndid learn, they lived. The searchers discovered human remains and the\ncrushed remnants of the 113 unit in a collapsed section of the ship.\nThen they discovered the big plasmoid--alive in subspace, undamaged and\nvery conscious of the difficulties it now faced.\n\nIt had already initiated its first attempt to solve the difficulties. It\nwas incapable of outward motion and could not change its own structure,\nbut it was no longer alone. It had constructed a small work-plasmoid\nwith visual and manipulating organs, as indifferent to exposure to\nsubspace as its designer. When the boarding party encountered the twain,\nthe working plasmoid apparently was attempting to perform some operation\non the frozen and shriveled brain of one of the human cadavers.\n\nBalmordan was a scientist of no mean stature among the Devagas. He did\nnot understand immediately what he saw, but he realized the probable\nimportance of understanding it. He had the plasmoids and their lifeless\nhuman research object transferred to the Devagas ship and settled down\nto observe what they did.\n\nReleased, the working plasmoid went back immediately to its task. It\ncompleted it. Then Balmordan and, presumably, the plasmoids waited.\nNothing happened.\n\nFinally, Balmordan investigated the dead brain. Installed in it he found\nwhat appeared to be near-microscopic energy receivers of plasmoid\nmaterial. There was nothing to indicate what type of energy they were\nto--or could--receive.\n\nDevagas scientists, when they happened to be of the hierarchy, always\nhad enjoyed one great advantage over most of their colleagues in the\nFederation. They had no difficulty in obtaining human volunteers to act\nas subjects for experimental work. Balmordan appointed three of his\nleast valuable crew members as volunteers for the plasmoid's\nexperiments.\n\nThe first of the three died almost immediately. The plasmoid, it turned\nout, lacked understanding of, among other things, the use and need of\nanesthetics. Balmordan accordingly assisted obligingly in the second\noperation. He was delighted when it became apparent that his assistance\nwas being willingly and comprehendingly accepted. This subject did not\ndie immediately. But he did not regain consciousness after the plasmoid\ndevices had been installed; and some hours later he did die, in\nconvulsions.\n\nNumber Three was more fortunate. He regained consciousness. He\ncomplained of headaches and, after he had slept, of nightmares. The next\nday he went into shock for a period of several hours. When he came out\nof it, he reported tremblingly that the big plasmoid was talking to him,\nthough he could not understand what it said.\n\nThere were two more test operations, both successful. In all three\ncases, the headaches and nightmares stopped in about a week. The first\nsubject in the series was beginning to understand the plasmoid.\nBalmordan listened to his reports. He had his three surviving volunteers\ngiven very extensive physical and psychological tests. They seemed to be\nin fine condition.\n\nBalmordan now had the operation performed on himself. When he woke up,\nhe disposed of his three predecessors. Then he devoted his full\nattention to learning what the plasmoid was trying to say. In about\nthree weeks it became clear....\n\nThe plasmoid had established contact with human beings because it\nneeded their help. It needed a base like Harvest Moon from which to\noperate and on which to provide for its requirements. It did not have\nthe understanding to permit it to construct such a base.\n\nSo it made the Devagas a proposition. It would work for them, somewhat\nas it had worked for the Old Galactics, if--unlike the Old\nGalactics--they would work for it.\n\nBalmordan, newly become a person of foremost importance, transmitted the\noffer to the hierarchy in the Hub. With no hesitation it was accepted,\nbut Balmordan was warned not to bring his monster into the Hub area. If\nit was discovered on a Devagas world, the hierarchy would be faced with\nthe choice between another war with the Federation and submission to\nmore severely restrictive Federation controls. It didn't care for either\nalternative; it had lost three wars with the Federated worlds in the\npast and each time had been reduced in strength.\n\nThey contacted Vishni's Independent Fleet. Vishni's area was not too far\nfrom Balmordan's ship position, and the Devagas had had previous\ndealings with him and his men. This time they hired the I-Fleet to\nbecome the plasmoid's temporary caretaker. Within a few weeks it was\nparked on Luscious, where it devoted itself to the minor creative\nexperimentation which presently was to puzzle Professor Mantelish.\n\nThe Devagas meanwhile toiled prodigiously to complete the constructions\nwhich were to be a central feature in the new alliance. On a base very\nfar removed from the Hub, on a base securely anchored and concealed\namong the gravitic swirlings and shiftings of a subspace turbulence\narea, virtually indetectable, the monster could make a very valuable\npartner. If it was discovered, the partnership could be disowned. So\ncould the fact that they had constructed the substation for it--in\nitself a grave breach of Federation treaties.\n\nThey built the substation. They built the armed subterranean observer's\ndome three days' travel away from it. The plasmoid was installed in its\nnew quarters. It then requested the use of the Vishni Fleet people for\nfurther experimentation.\n\nThe hierarchy was glad to grant the request. It would have had to get\nrid of those too well informed hirelings in any case.\n\nHaving received its experimental material, the plasmoid requested the\nDevagas to stay away from the substation for a while.\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\nThe Devagas, said Lyad, while not too happy with their ally's\nincreasingly independent attitude, were more anxious than ever to see\nthe alliance progress to the working stage. As an indication of its\npotential usefulness, the monster had provided them with a variety of\nworking plasmoid robots, built to their own specifications.\n\n\"What kind of specifications?\" Trigger inquired.\n\nLyad hadn't learned in detail, but some of the robots appeared to have\ndemonstrated rather alarming possibilities. Those possibilities,\nhowever, were precisely what intrigued the hierarchy most.\n\nMantelish smacked his lips thoughtfully and shook his head. \"Not good!\"\nhe said. \"Not at all good! I'm beginning to think--\" He paused a\nmoment. \"Go on, Lyad.\"\n\nThe hierarchy was now giving renewed consideration to a curious request\nthe plasmoid had made almost as soon as Balmordan became capable of\nunderstanding it. The request had been to find and destroy plasmoid\n113-A.\n\nThe Ermetyne's amber eyes switched to Trigger. \"Shall I?\" she asked.\n\nTrigger nodded.\n\nAnd a specific human being. The Devagas already had established that\nthis human being must be Trigger Argee.\n\n\"_What?_\" Mantelish's thick white eyebrows shot up. \"113-A we can\nunderstand--it is afraid of being in some way brought back under\ncontrol. But why Trigger?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Lyad said carefully, \"112 was aware that 113-A intended to\ncondition Trigger into being its interpreter.\"\n\nProfessor Mantelish's jaw dropped. He swung his head toward Trigger. \"Is\nthat true?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"It's true, all right. We've been working on it, but we\nhaven't got too far along. Tell you later. Go ahead, Lyad.\"\n\nThe Devagas, naturally, hadn't acted on the king plasmoid's naive\nsuggestion. Whatever it feared was more than likely to be very useful to\nthem. Instead they made preparations to bring both 113-A and Trigger\nArgee into their possession. They would then have a new, strong\nbargaining point in their dealings with their dubious partner. But they\ndiscovered promptly that neither Trigger nor 113-A were at all easy to\ncome by.\n\nBalmordan now suggested a modification of tactics. The hierarchy had\nseen to it that a number of interpreters were available for 112;\nBalmordan in consequence had lost much of his early importance and was\nanxious to regain it. His proposal was that all efforts should be\ndirected at obtaining 113-A. Once it was obtained, he himself would\nvolunteer to become its first interpreter. Trigger Argee, because of the\ninformation she might reveal to others, should be destroyed--a far\nsimpler operation than attempting to take her alive.\n\nThis was agreed to; and Balmordan was authorized to carry out both\noperations.\n\nMantelish had begun shaking his head again. \"No!\" he said suddenly and\nloudly. He looked at Lyad, then at Trigger. \"Trigger!\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Trigger.\n\n\"Take that deceitful woman to her cabin,\" Mantelish ordered. \"Lock her\nup. I have something to say to the Commissioner.\"\n\nTrigger arose. \"All right,\" she said. \"Come on, Lyad.\"\n\nThe two of them left the lounge. Mantelish stood up and went over to the\nCommissioner. He grasped the Commissioner's jacket lapels.\n\n\"Holati, old friend!\" he began emotionally.\n\n\"What is it, old friend?\" the Commissioner inquired.\n\n\"What I have to say,\" Mantelish rumbled, \"will shock you. Profoundly.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed the Commissioner.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mantelish. \"That plasmoid 112--it has, of course, an almost\ninestimable potential value to civilization.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Commissioner agreed.\n\n\"But it also,\" said Mantelish, \"represents a quite intolerable threat to\ncivilization.\"\n\n\"Mantelish!\" cried the Commissioner.\n\n\"It does. You don't comprehend these matters as I do. Holati, that\nplasmoid must be destroyed! Secretly, if possible. And by us!\"\n\n\"Mantelish!\" gasped the Commissioner. \"You can't be serious!\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Commissioner Tate, \"sit down. I'm open to suggestions.\"\nSpace-armor drill hadn't been featured much in the Colonial School's\ncrowded curriculum. But the Commissioner broke out one of the ship's two\nheavy-duty suits; and when Trigger wasn't at the controls, eating,\nsleeping, or taking care of the ship's housekeeping with Lyad and\nMantelish, she drilled.\n\nShe wasn't at the controls too often. When she was, they had to surface\nand proceed in normal space. But Lyad, not too surprisingly, turned out\nto be a qualified subspace pilot. Even less surprisingly, she already\nhad made a careful study of the ship's controls. After a few hours of\ninstruction, she went on shift with the Commissioner along the less\nrugged stretches. In this area, none of the stretches were smooth.\n\nWhen not on duty, Lyad lay on her bunk and brooded.\n\nMantelish tried to be useful.\n\nRepulsive might have been brooding too. He didn't make himself\nnoticeable.\n\nTime passed. The stretches got rougher. The last ten hours, the\nCommissioner didn't stir out of the control seat. Lyad had been locked\nin her cabin again as the critical period approached. In normal space,\nthe substation should have been in clear detector range by now. Here,\nthe detectors gave occasional blurry, uncertain indications that\nsomewhere in the swirling energies about them might be something more\nsolidly material. It was like creeping through jungle thickets towards\nthe point where a dangerous quarry lurked.\n\nThey eased down on the coordinate points. They came sliding out between\ntwo monstrous twisters. The detectors leaped to life.\n\n\"Ship!\" said the Commissioner. He swore. \"Frigate class,\" he said an\ninstant later. He turned his head toward Trigger. \"Get Lyad! They're in\ncommunication range. We'll let her communicate.\"\n\nTrigger, heart hammering, ran to get Lyad. The Commissioner had the\nshort-range communicator on when they came hurrying back to the control\nroom together.\n\n\"That the Aurora?\" he asked.\n\nLyad glanced at the outline in the detectors. \"It is!\" Her face went\nwhite.\n\n\"Talk to 'em,\" he ordered. \"Know their call number?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Lyad sat down at the communicator. Her hands shook for a\nmoment, then steadied. \"What am I to say?\"\n\n\"Just find out what's happened, to start with. Why they're still here.\nThen we'll improvise. Get them to come to the screen if you can.\"\n\nLyad's fingers flew over the tabs. The communicator signaled contact.\n\nLyad said evenly, \"Come in, Aurora! This is the Ermetyne.\"\n\nThere was a pause, a rather unaccountably long pause, Trigger thought.\nThen a voice said, \"Yes, First Lady?\"\n\nLyad's eyes widened for an instant. \"Come in on visual, Captain!\" There\nwas the snap of command in the words.\n\nAgain a pause. Then suddenly the communicator was looking into the\nAurora's control room. A brown-bearded, rather lumpy-faced man in\nuniform sat before the other screen. There were other uniformed men\nbehind him. Trigger heard the Ermetyne's breath suck in and turned to\nwatch Lyad's face.\n\n\"Why haven't you carried out your instructions, Captain?\" The voice was\nstill even.\n\n\"There was a difficulty with the engines, First Lady.\"\n\nLyad nodded. \"Very well. Stand by for new instructions.\"\n\nShe switched off the communicator. She twisted around toward the\nCommissioner. \"Get us out of here!\" she said, chalk-faced. \"_Fast!_\nThose aren't my men.\"\n\nFlame bellowed about them in subspace. The Commissioner's hand slapped a\nbutton. The flame vanished and stars shone all around. The engines\nhurled them forward. Twelve seconds later, they angled and dived again.\nSubspace reappeared.\n\n\"Guess you were right!\" the Commissioner said. He idled the engines and\nscratched his chin. \"But what were they?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Everything about it was wrong!\" Lyad was saying presently, her face\nstill white. \"Their faces, in particular, were deformed!\" She looked at\nTrigger. \"You saw it?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. She suspected she was on the white-faced side herself.\n\"The captain,\" she said. \"I didn't look at the others. It looked as if\nhis cheeks and forehead were pushed out of shape!\"\n\nThere was a short silence. \"Well,\" said the Commissioner, \"seems like\nthat plasmoid has been doing some more experimenting. Question is, how\ndid it get to them?\"\n\nThey didn't find any answers to that. Lyad insisted the Aurora had been\ngiven specific orders to avoid the immediate vicinity of the substation.\nIts only purpose there was to observe and report on anything that seemed\nto be going on in the area. She couldn't imagine her crew disobeying the\norders.\n\n\"That mind-level control business,\" Trigger said finally. \"Maybe _it_\nfound a way of going out to _them_.\"\n\nShe could see by their faces that the idea had occurred, and that they\ndidn't like it. Well, neither did she.\n\nThey pitched a few more ideas around. None of them seemed helpful.\n\n\"Unless we just want to hightail it,\" the Commissioner said finally,\n\"about the only thing we can do is go back and slug it out with the\nfrigate first. We can't risk snooping around the station while she's\nthere and likely to start pounding on our backs any second.\"\n\nMantelish looked startled. \"Holati,\" he cautioned, \"That's a warship!\"\n\n\"Mantelish,\" the Commissioner said, a trifle coldly, \"what you've been\nriding in isn't a canoe.\" He glanced at Lyad. \"I suppose you'd feel\nhappier if you weren't locked up in your cabin during the ruckus?\"\n\nLyad gave him a strained smile. \"Commissioner,\" she said, \"You're so\nright!\"\n\n\"Then keep your seat,\" he said. \"We'll start prowling.\"\n\nThey prowled. It took an hour to recontact the Aurora, presumably\nbecause the Aurora was also prowling for them. Suddenly the detectors\ncame alive.\n\nThe ship's guns went off at once. Then subspace went careening crazily\npast in the screens. Trigger looked at the screens for a few seconds,\ngulped and started studying the floor.\n\nWhatever the plasmoid had done to the frigate's crew, they appeared to\nhave lost none of their ability to give battle. It was a very brisk\naffair. But neither had the onetime Squadron Commander Tate lost much of\nhis talent along those lines. The frigate had many more guns but no\nbetter range. And he had the faster ship. Four minutes after the first\nshots were exchanged, the Aurora blew up.\n\nThe ripped hunk of the Aurora's hull which the Commissioner presently\nbrought into the lock appeared to have had three approximately\nquarter-inch holes driven at a slant through it, which subsequently had\nbeen plugged again. The plugging material was plasmoid in character.\n\n\"There were two holes in another piece,\" the Commissioner said, very\nthoughtfully. \"If that's the average, she was punched in a few thousand\nspots. Let's go have a better look.\"\n\nHe and Mantelish maneuvered the gravity crane carrying the holed slab of\nsteel-alloy into the ship's workshop. Lyad was locked back into her\ncabin, and Trigger went on guard in the control room and looked out\nwistfully at the stars of normal space.\n\nHalf an hour later, the two men came up the passage and joined her. They\nappeared preoccupied.\n\n\"It's an unpleasant picture, Trigger girl,\" the Commissioner said.\n\"Those holes look sort of chewed through. Whatever did the chewing was\nalso apparently capable of sealing up the portion behind it as it went\nalong. What it did to the men when it got inside we don't know.\nMantelish feels we might compare it roughly to the effects of ordinary\ngerm invasion. It doesn't really matter. It fixed them.\"\n\n\"Mighty large germs!\" Trigger said. \"Why didn't their meteor reflectors\nstop them?\"\n\n\"If the ship was hove to and these things just drifted in gradually--\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. That wouldn't activate the reflectors. Then, if we keep\nmoving ourselves--\"\n\n\"That,\" said the Commissioner, \"was what I had in mind.\"\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\nTrigger couldn't keep from staring at the subspace station. It was\nunbelievable.\n\nOne could still tell that the human construction gangs had put up a\nstandard type of armored station down there. A very big, very massive\none, but normally shaped, nearly spherical. One could tell it only by\nthe fact that at the gun pits the original material still showed\nthrough. Everywhere else it had vanished under great black masses of\nmaterial which the plasmoids had added to the station's structure.\n\nAll over that black, lumpy, lavalike surface the plasmoids crawled,\nwalked, soared and wriggled. There were thousands of them, perhaps\nhundreds of different types. It looked like a wet, black, rotten stump\nswarming with life inside and out.\n\nNeither she nor the two men had made much mention of its appearance. All\nyou could say was that it was horrible.\n\nThe plasmoids they could see ignored the ship. They also gave no\nnoticeable attention to the eight space flares the Commissioner had set\nin a rough cube about the station. But for the first two hours after\ntheir arrival, the ship's meteor reflectors remained active. An\noccasional tap at first, then an almost continuous pecking, finally a\ntwenty-minute drumfire that filled the reflector screens with madly\ndancing clouds of tiny sparks. Suddenly it ended. Either the king\nplasmoid had exhausted its supply of that particular weapon or it\npreferred to conserve what it had left.\n\n\"Might test their guns,\" the Commissioner muttered. He looked very\nunhappy, Trigger thought.\n\nHe circled off, put on speed, came back and flicked the ship past the\nstation's flank. He drew bursts from two pits with a promptness which\nconfirmed what already had been almost a certainty--that the gun\ninstallations operated automatically. They seemed remarkably feeble\nweapons for a station of that size. The Devagas apparently had had sense\nenough not to give the plasmoid every advantage.\n\nThe Commissioner plunked a test shot next into one of the black\nprotuberances. A small fiery crater appeared. It darkened quickly again.\nOut of the biggest opening, down near what would have been the foot of\nthe stump if it had been a stump, something, long, red and wormlike\nwriggled rapidly. It flowed up over the structure's surface to the\ndamaged point and thrust the tip of its front end into the crater. Black\nmaterial began to flow from the tip. The plasmoid moved its front end\nback and forth across the damaged area. Others of the same kind came out\nand joined it. The crater began to fill out.\n\nThey hauled away a little and surfaced. Normal space looked clean,\nbeautiful, homelike, calmly shining. None of them except Lyad had slept\nfor over twenty hours. \"What do you think?\" the Commissioner asked.\n\nThey discussed what they had seen in subdued voices. Nobody had a plan.\nThey agreed that one thing they could be sure of was that the Vishni\nFleet people and any other human beings who might have been on the\nstation when it was turned over to the king plasmoid were no longer\nalive. Unless, of course, something had been done to them much more\ndrastic than had happened to the Aurora's crew. The ship had passed by\nthe biggest opening, like a low wide black mouth, close enough to make\nout that it extended far back into the original station's interior. The\nstation was open and airless as Harvest Moon had been before the humans\ngot there.\n\n\"Some of those things down there,\" the Commissioner said, \"had\nattachments that would crack any suit wide open. A lot of them are big,\nand a lot of them are fast. Once we were inside, we'd have no\nmaneuverability to speak of. If the termites didn't get to us before we\ngot inside. Suits won't do it here.\" He was a gambler, and a gambler\ndoesn't buck impossible odds.\n\n\"What could you do with the guns?\" Trigger asked.\n\n\"Not too much. They're not meant to take down a fortress. Scratching\naround on the surface with them would just mark the thing up. We can\nwiden that opening by quite a bit, and once it's widened, I can flip in\nthe bomb. But it would be just blind luck if we nailed the one we're\nafter that way. With a dozen bombs we could break up the station. But we\ndon't have them.\"\n\nThey nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"The worst part of that,\" he went on, \"is that it would be completely\nobvious. The Council's right when it worries about fumbles here. Tranest\nand the Devagas know the thing is in there. If the Federation can't\nproduce it, both those outfits have the Council over a barrel. Or we\ncould be setting the Hub up for fifty years of fighting among the member\nworlds, sometime in the next few hours.\"\n\nMantelish and Trigger nodded again. More thoughtfully.\n\n\"Nevertheless--\" Mantelish began suddenly. He checked himself.\n\n\"Well, you're right,\" the Commissioner said. \"That stuff down there just\ncan't be turned loose, that's all! The thing's still only experimenting.\nWe don't know what it's going to wind up with. So I guess we'll be\ntrying the guns and the bomb finally, and then see what else we can\ndo.... Now look, we've got--what is it?--nine or ten hours left. The\nfirst of the boys are pretty sure to come helling in around then. Or\nmaybe something's happened we don't know about, and they'll be here in\nthirty minutes. We can't tell. But I'm in favor of knocking off now and\njust grabbing a couple of hours' sleep. Then we'll get our brains\ntogether again. Maybe by then somebody has come up with something like\nan idea. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Where,\" Mantelish said, \"is the ship going to be while we're sleeping?\"\n\n\"Subspace,\" said the Commissioner. He saw their expressions. \"Don't\nworry! I'll put her on a wide orbit and I'll stick out every alarm on\nboard. I'll also sleep in the control chair. But in case somebody gets\nhere early, we've got to be around to tell them about that space termite\ntrick.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTrigger hadn't expected she would be able to sleep, not where they were.\nBut afterwards she couldn't even remember getting stretched out all the\nway on the bunk.\n\nShe woke up less than an hour later, feeling very uncomfortable.\nRepulsive had been talking to her.\n\nShe sat up and looked around the dark cabin with frightened eyes. After\na moment, she got out of the bunk and went up the passage toward the\nlounge and the control section.\n\nHolati Tate was lying slumped back in his chair, eyes closed, breathing\nslowly and evenly. Trigger put out a hand to touch his shoulder and\nthen drew it back. She glanced up for a moment at the plasmoid station\nin the screen, seeming to turn slowly as they went orbiting by it. She\nnoticed that one of the space flares they'd planted there had gone out,\nor else it had been plucked away by a passing twister's touch. She\nlooked away quickly again, turned and went restlessly back through the\nlounge, and up the passage, toward the cabins. She went by the two suits\nof space armor at the lock without looking at them. She opened the door\nto Mantelish's cabin and looked inside. The professor lay sprawled\nacross the bunk in his clothes, breathing slowly and regularly.\n\nTrigger closed his door again. Lyad might be wakeful, she thought. She\ncrossed the passage and unlocked the door to the Ermetyne's cabin. The\nlights in the cabin were on, but Lyad also lay there placidly asleep,\nher face relaxed and young looking.\n\nTrigger put her fist to her mouth and bit down hard on her knuckles for\na moment. She frowned intensely at nothing. Then she closed and locked\nthe cabin door, went back up the passage and into the control room. She\nsat down before the communicator, glanced up once more at the plasmoid\nstation in the screen, got up restlessly and went over to the\nCommissioner's chair. She stood there, looking down at him. The\nCommissioner slept on.\n\nThen Repulsive said it again.\n\n\"No!\" Trigger whispered fiercely. \"I won't! I can't! You can't make me\ndo it!\"\n\nThere was a stillness then, In the stillness, it was made very clear\nthat nobody intended to make her do anything.\n\nAnd then the stillness just waited.\n\nShe cried a little.\n\nSo this was it.\n\n\"All right,\" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe armor suit's triple light-beam blazed into the wide, low, black,\nwet-looking mouth rushing toward her. It was much bigger than she had\nthought when looking at it from the ship. Far behind her, the fire\nneedles of the single gun pit which her passage to the station had\naroused still slashed mindlessly about. They weren't geared to stop\nsuits, and they hadn't come anywhere near her. But the plasmoids looked\ngeared to stop suits.\n\nThey were swarming in clusters in the black mouth like maggots in a\nrotting skull. Part of the swarms had spilled out over the lips of the\nmouth, clinging, crawling, rippling swiftly about. Trigger shifted the\nflight controls with the fingers of one hand, dropping a little, then\nstraightening again. She might be coming in too fast. But she had to get\npast that mass at the opening.\n\nThen the black mouth suddenly yawned wide before her. Her left hand\npressed the gun handle. Twin blasts stabbed ahead, blinding white,\nstruck the churning masses, blazed over them. They burned, scattered,\nexploded, and rolled back, burning and exploding, in a double wave to\nmeet her.\n\n\"Too fast!\" Repulsive said anxiously. \"Much too fast!\"\n\nShe knew it. But she couldn't have forced herself to do it slowly. The\narmor suit slammed at a slant into a piled, writhing, burning hardness\nof plasmoid bodies, bounced upward. She went over and over, yanking down\nall the way on the flight controls. She closed her eyes for a moment.\n\nWhen she opened them again, the suit hung poised a little above black\nuneven flooring, turned back half toward the entrance mouth. A black\nceiling was less than twenty feet above her head.\n\nThe plasmoids were there. The suit's light beams played over the massed,\nmoving ranks: squat bodies and sinuous ones, immensities that scraped\nthe ceiling, stalked limbs and gaping nutcracker jaws, blurs of motion\nher eyes couldn't step down to define into shapes. Some still blazed\nwith her guns' white fire. The closest were thirty feet away.\n\nThey stayed there. They didn't come any closer.\n\nShe swung the suit slowly away from the entrance. The ring was closed\nall about her. But it wasn't tightening.\n\nRepulsive had thought he could do it.\n\nShe asked in her mind, \"Which way?\"\n\nShe got a feeling of direction, turned the suit a little more and\nstarted it gliding forward. The ranks ahead didn't give way, but they\nwent down. Those that could go down. Some weren't built for it. The suit\nbumped up gently against one huge bulk, and a six-inch pale blue eye\nlooked at her for a moment as she went circling around it. \"Eyes for\nwhat?\" somebody in the back of her mind wondered briefly. She glanced\ninto the suit's rear view screen and saw that the ones who had gone down\nwere getting up again, mixed with the ones who came crowding after her.\nThirty feet away!\n\nRepulsive was doing it.\n\nSo far there weren't any guns. If they hit guns, that would be her job\nand the suit's. The king plasmoid should be regretting by now that it\nhad wasted its experimental human material. Though it mightn't have been\nreally wasted; it might be incorporated in the stuff that came crowding\nafter her, and kept going down ahead.\n\nBlack ceiling, black floor seemed to stretch on endlessly. She kept the\nsuit moving slowly along. At last the beams picked up low walls ahead,\nconverging at the point toward which the suit was gliding. At the point\nof convergence there seemed to be a narrow passage.\n\nPlasmoid bodies were wedged into it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe suit pulled them out one by one, its steel grippers clamping down\nupon things no softer than itself. But it had power to work with and\nthey didn't, at the moment. Behind the ones it pulled out there were\npresently glimpses of the swiftly weaving motion of giant red\nworm-shapes sealing up the passage. After a while, they stopped weaving\neach time the suit returned and started again as it withdrew, dragging\nout another plasmoid body.\n\nThen the suit went gliding over a stilled tangle of red worm bodies. And\nthere was the sealed end of the passage.\n\nThe stuff was still soft. The guns blazed, bit into it, ate it away,\ntheir brilliance washing back over the suit. The sealing gave way before\nthe suit did. They went through and came out into....\n\nShe didn't know what they had come out into. It was like a fog of\ndarkness, growing thicker as they went sliding forward. The light beams\nseemed to be dimming. Then they quietly went out as if they'd switched\nthemselves off.\n\nIn blackness, she fingered the light controls and knew they weren't\nswitched off.\n\n\"Repulsive!\" she cried in her mind.\n\nRepulsive couldn't help with the blackness. She got the feeling of\ndirection. The blackness seemed to be soaking behind her eyes. She held\nthe speed throttle steady in fingers slippery with sweat, and that was\nthe only way she could tell they were still moving forward.\n\nAfter a while, they bumped gently against something that had to be a\nwall, it was so big, though at first she wasn't sure it was a wall. They\nmoved along it for a time, then came to the end of it and were moving in\nthe right direction again.\n\nThey seemed to be in a passage now, a rather narrow one. They touched\nwalls and ceiling from time to time. She thought they were moving\ndownward.\n\nThere was a picture in front of her. She realized suddenly that she had\nbeen watching it for some time. But it wasn't until this moment that she\nbecame really aware of it.\n\nThe beast was big, strong and angry. It bellowed and screamed, shaking\nand covered with foam. She couldn't see it too clearly, but she had the\nimpression of mad, staring eyes and a terrible lust to crush and\ndestroy.\n\nBut something was holding it. Something held it quietly and firmly, for\nall its plunging. It reared once more now, a gross, lumbering hugeness,\nand came crashing down to its knees. Then it went over on its side.\n\nThe suit's beams flashed on. Trigger squeezed her eyes tight shut,\nblinded by the light that flashed back from black walls all around. Then\nher fingers remembered the right drill and dimmed the lights. She opened\nher eyes again and stared for a long moment at the great gray\nmummy-shape before one of the black walls.\n\n\"Repulsive?\" she asked in her mind.\n\nRepulsive didn't answer. The suit hung quietly in the huge black\nchamber. She didn't remember having stopped it. She turned it now\nslowly. There were eight or nine passages leading out of here, through\nwalls, ceiling, floor.\n\n\"Repulsive!\" she cried plaintively.\n\nSilence.\n\nShe glanced once more at the king plasmoid against the wall. It stayed\nsilent too. And it was as if the two silences cancelled each other out.\n\nShe remembered the last feeling of moving downward and lifted the suit\ntoward a passage that came in through the ceiling. She hung before it,\nconsidering. Far up and back in its darkness, a bright light suddenly\nblazed, vanished, and blazed again. Something was coming down the\npassage, fast....\n\nHer hand started for the gun handle. Then it remembered another drill\nand flashed to the suit's communicator. A voice crashed in around her.\n\n\"Trigger, Trigger, Trigger!\" it sobbed.\n\n\"Ape!\" she screamed. \"You aren't hurt?\"\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nMantelish's garden in the highland south of Ceyce had a certain renown\nall over the Hub. It had been donated to the professor twenty-five years\nago by the populace of another Federation world. That populace had\nnegligently permitted a hideous pestilence of some kind to be imported,\nand had been saved in the nick of time by the appropriate\npestilence-killer, hastily developed and forwarded to it by Mantelish.\nIn return, a lifetime ambition had been fulfilled for him--his own\nprivate botanical garden plus an unlimited fund for stocking and upkeep.\n\nTo one side of the big garden house, where Mantelish stayed whenever he\nfound the time to go puttering around among his specimens, stood a giant\nsequoia, generally reputed to be the oldest living thing in the Hub\noutside of the Life Banks. It was certainly extremely old, even for a\nsequoia. For the last decade there had been considerable talk about the\nadvisability of removing it before it collapsed and crushed the house\nand everyone in it. But it was one of the professor's great favorites,\nand so far he had vetoed the suggestion.\n\nElbows propped on the broad white balustrade of the porch before her\nthird-story bedroom, Trigger was studying the sequoia's crown with a\npair of field glasses when Pilch arrived. She laid the glasses down and\ninvited her guest to pull up a chair and help her admire the view.\n\nThey admired the view for a little in silence. \"It certainly is a\nbeautiful place!\" Pilch said then. She glanced down at Professor\nMantelish, a couple of hundred yards from the house, dressed in a pair\nof tanned shorts and busily grubbing away with a spade around some new\nsort of shrub he'd just planted, and smiled. \"I took the first\nopportunity I've had to come see you,\" she said.\n\nTrigger looked at her and laughed. \"I thought you might. You weren't\nsatisfied with the reports then?\"\n\nPilch said, \"Of course not! But it was obvious the emergency was over,\nso I was whisked away to something else.\" She frowned slightly.\n\"Sometimes,\" she admitted, \"the Service keeps me the least bit busier\nthan I'd prefer to be. So now it's been six months!\"\n\n\"I would have come in for another interview if you'd called me,\" Trigger\nsaid.\n\n\"I know,\" said Pilch. \"But that would have made it official. I can keep\nthis visit off the record.\" Her eyes met Trigger's for a moment. \"And I\nhave a feeling I will. Also, of course, I'm not pushing for any answers\nyou mightn't care to give.\"\n\n\"Just push away,\" Trigger said agreeably.\n\n\"Well, we got the Commissioner's call from his ship. A worried man he\nwas. So it seems now that we've had one of the Old Galactics around for\na while. When did you first find out about it?\"\n\n\"On the morning after our interview. Right after I got up.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nTrigger laughed. \"I watch my weight. When I noticed I'd turned three and\na half pounds heavier overnight than I'd averaged the past four years, I\nknew all right!\"\n\nPilch smiled faintly. \"You weren't alarmed at all?\"\n\n\"No. I guess I'd been prepared just enough by that time. But then, you\nknow, I forgot all about it again until Lyad and Flam opened that\npurse--and he wasn't inside. Then I remembered, and after that I didn't\nforget again.\"\n\n\"No. Of course.\" Pilch's slim fingers tapped the surface of the table\nbetween them. She said then, paying Repulsive the highest compliment\nPilch could give, \"It--he--was a good therapist!\" After a moment, she\nadded. \"I had a talk with Commissioner Tate an hour or so ago. He's\npreparing to leave Maccadon again, I understand.\"\n\n\"That's right. He's been organizing that big exploration trip of\nMantelish's the past couple of months. He'll be in charge of it when\nthey take off.\"\n\n\"You're not going along?\" Pilch asked.\n\nTrigger shook her head. \"Not this time. Ape and I--Captain Quillan and\nI, that is--\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Pilch said. She smiled. \"You picked a good one on the second\ntry!\"\n\n\"Quillan's all right,\" Trigger agreed. \"If you watch him a little.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" said Pilch, \"Commissioner Tate seems to be just the least bit\nworried about you still.\"\n\nTrigger put a finger to her temple and made a small circling motion. \"A\nbit ta-ta?\"\n\n\"Not exactly that, perhaps. But it seems,\" said Pilch, \"that you've told\nhim a good deal about the history of the Old Galactics, including what\nended them as a race thirty-two thousand years ago.\"\n\nTrigger's face clouded a little. \"Yes,\" she said. She sat silent for a\nmoment. \"Well, I got that from Repulsive somewhere along the line,\" she\nsaid then. \"It didn't really come clear until some time after we'd got\nback. But it was there in those pictures in the interview.\"\n\n\"The giants stamping on the farm?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"And the fast clock and the slow one. He was trying to\ntell it then. The Jesters--that's the giants--they're fast and tough\nlike us. Apparently,\" Trigger said thoughtfully, \"they're a good deal\nlike us in a lot of ways. But worse. Much worse! And the Old Galactics\nwere just slow. They thought slow; they moved slow--they did almost\neverything slow. At full gallop, old Repulsive couldn't have kept up\nwith a healthy snail. Besides, they just liked to grow things and tinker\nwith things and so on. They didn't go in for fighting, and they never\ngot to be at all good at it. So they just got wiped out, practically.\"\n\n\"The Jesters were good at fighting, eh?\"\n\nTrigger nodded. \"Very good. Like us, again.\"\n\n\"Where did they come from?\"\n\n\"Repulsive thought they were outsiders. He wasn't sure. He and that\nother O.G. were on the sidelines, running their protein collecting\nstation, when the Jesters arrived; and it was all over and they were\ngone before he had learned much about it.\"\n\n\"From outside the galaxy!\" Pilch said thoughtfully. She cleared her\nthroat. \"What's this business about they might be back again?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said, \"he thought they might be. Just might. Actually he\nbelieved the Jesters got wiped out too.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Pilch said. \"How's that?\"\n\n\"Quite a lot of the Old Galactics went along with them like Repulsive\nwent along with me. And one of the things they did know,\" Trigger said,\n\"was how to spread diseases like nobody's business. About like we use\nweed-killers. Wholesale. They could clean out the average planet of any\nparticular thing they didn't want there in about a week. So it's not\nreally too likely the Jesters will be back.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pilch.\n\n\"But if they are coming, Repulsive thought they'd be due in this area\nin about another eight centuries. That looked like a very short time to\nhim, of course. He thought it would be best to pass on a warning.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Pilch said after a brief pause, \"I find myself agreeing with\nhim there, Trigger! I might turn in a short report on this, after all.\"\n\n\"I think you should, really,\" Trigger said. She smiled suddenly. \"Of\ncourse, it might wind up with people thinking both of us are ta-ta!\"\n\n\"I'll risk that,\" said Pilch. \"It's been thought of me before.\"\n\n\"If they did come,\" Trigger said, \"I guess we'd take them anyway. We've\ntaken everything else like that that came long. And besides--\"\n\nHer voice trailed off thoughtfully. She studied the table top for a\nmoment. Then she looked up at Pilch.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, smiling, \"any other questions?\"\n\n\"A few,\" said Pilch, passing up the \"and besides--\" She considered. \"Did\nyou ever actually see him make contact with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Trigger said. \"I was always asleep, and I suppose he made sure I'd\nstay asleep. They're built sort of like a leech, you know. I guess he\nknew I wouldn't feel comfortable about having something like that go\noozing into the side of my neck or start oozing out again. Anyway, he\nnever did let me see it.\"\n\n\"Considerate little fellow!\" said Pilch. She sighed. \"Well, everything\ncame out very satisfactorily--much more so than anyone could have dared\nhope at one time. All that's left is a very intriguing mystery which the\nHub will be chatting about for years.... What happened aboard Doctor\nFayle's vanished ship that caused the king plasmoid to awaken to awful\nlife?\" she cried. \"What equally mysterious event brought about its death\non that strangely hideous structure it had built in subspace? _What was\nit planning to do there?_ Etcetera.\" She smiled at Trigger. \"Yes, very\ngood!\"\n\n\"I saw they camouflaged out what was still visible of the original\nsubstation before they let in the news viewers,\" Trigger remarked.\n\"Bright idea somebody had there!\"\n\n\"Yes. It was I. And the Devagas hierarchy is broken, and the Ermetynes\nrun out of Tranest. Two very bad spots, those were! I don't recall\nhaving heard what they did to your friend, Pluly.\"\n\n\"_I_ heard,\" Trigger said. \"He just got black-listed by Grand Commerce\nfinally and lost all his shipping concessions. However, his daughter is\nmarried to an up and coming young businessman who happened to be on hand\nand have the money and other qualifications to pick up those\nconcessions.\" She laughed. \"It's the Inger Lines now. They're smart\ncharacters, in a way!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pilch. \"In a way. Did you know Lyad Ermetyne put in for\nvoluntary rehabilitation with us, and then changed her mind and joined\nthe Service?\"\n\n\"I'd heard of it.\" Trigger hesitated. \"Did you know Lyad paid me a short\nvisit about an hour before you got here this morning?\"\n\n\"I thought she would,\" Pilch said. \"We came in to Maccadon together.\"\n\nTrigger had been a little startled when she answered the doorchime and\nsaw Lyad standing there. She invited the Ermetyne in.\n\n\"I thought I'd thank you personally,\" Lyad said casually, \"for a\nrecording which was delivered to me some months ago.\"\n\n\"That's quite all right,\" Trigger said, also casually. \"I was sure I\nwasn't going to have any use for it.\"\n\nLyad studied her face for a moment. \"To be honest about it, Trigger\nArgee,\" she said, \"I still don't feel entirely cordial toward you!\nHowever, I did appreciate the gesture of letting me have the recording.\nSo I decided to drop by to tell you there isn't really too much left in\nthe way of hard feelings, on my part.\"\n\nThey shook hands restrainedly, and the Ermetyne sauntered out again.\n\n\"The other reason she came here,\" Pilch said, \"is to take care of the\nfinancing of Mantelish's expedition.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that!\" Trigger said, surprised.\n\n\"It's her way of making amends. Her legitimate Hub holdings are still\nenormous, of course. She can afford it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Trigger said, \"that's one thing about Lyad--she's wholehearted!\"\n\n\"She's that,\" said Pilch. \"Rarely have I seen anyone rip into total\ntherapy with the verve displayed by the Ermetyne. She mentioned on one\noccasion that there simply had to be some way of getting ahead of you\nagain.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Trigger.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pilch. \"By the way, what are your own plans nowadays? Aside\nfrom getting married.\"\n\nTrigger stretched slim tanned arms over her head and grinned. \"No\nimmediate plans!\" she said. \"I've resigned from Precol. Got a couple of\nchecks from the Federation. One to cover my expenses on that plasmoid\nbusiness--that was the Dawn City fare mainly--and the other for the five\nweeks special duty they figured I was on for them. So I'm up to five\nthousand crowns again, and I thought I'd just loaf around and sort of\nthink things over till Quillan gets back from his current assignment.\"\n\n\"I see. When is Major Quillan returning?\"\n\n\"In about a month. It's Captain Quillan at present, by the way.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Pilch. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"That unwarranted interference with a political situation business.\nThey'd broadcast a warning against taking individual action of any kind\nagainst the plasmoid station. But when he got there and heard the\nCommissioner was in a kind of coma, and I wasn't even on board, he lost\nhis head and came charging into the station after me, flinging grenades\nand so on around. The plasmoids would have finished him off pretty\nquick, except most of them had started slowing down as soon as Repulsive\nturned off the main one. The lunatic was lucky the termites didn't get\nto him before he even reached the station!\"\n\nPilch said, \"Termites?\"\n\nTrigger told her about the termites.\n\n\"Ugh!\" said Pilch. \"I hadn't heard about those. So they broke him for\nthat. It hardly seems right.\"\n\n\"Well, you have to have discipline,\" Trigger said tolerantly. \"Ape's a\nbit short on that end anyway. They'll be upgrading him again fairly\nsoon, I imagine. I might just be going into Space Scout Intelligence\nmyself, by the way. They said they'd be glad to have me.\"\n\n\"Not at all incidentally,\" remarked Pilch, \"my Service also would be\nglad to have you.\"\n\n\"Would they?\" Trigger looked at her thoughtfully. \"That includes that\ntotal therapy process, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Usually,\" said Pilch.\n\n\"Well, I might some day. But not just yet.\" She smiled. \"Let's let Lyad\nget a head start! Actually, it's just I've found out there are so many\ninteresting things going on all around that I'd like to look them over a\nbit before I go charging seriously into a career again.\" She reached\nacross the table and tapped Pilch's wrist. \"And I'll show you one\ninteresting thing that's going on right here! Take Mantelish's big tree\nout there!\"\n\n\"The sequoia?\"\n\n\"Yes. Now just last year it was looking so bad they almost talked the\nprofessor into having it taken away. Hardly a green branch left on it.\"\n\nPilch shaded her eyes and looked at the sequoia's crown far above them.\n\"It looks,\" she observed reflectively, \"in fairly good shape at the\nmoment, I'd say!\"\n\n\"Yes, and it's getting greener every week. Mantelish brags about a new\nsolvent he's been dosing its roots with. You see that great big branch\nlike an L turned upward, just a little above the center?\"\n\nPilch looked again. \"Yes,\" she said after a moment, \"I think so.\"\n\n\"Just before the L turns upward, there's a little cluster of green\nbranches,\" Trigger said.\n\n\"I see those, yes.\"\n\nTrigger picked up the field glasses and handed them to her. \"Get those\nlittle branches in the glasses,\" she said.\n\nPilch said presently, \"Got them.\"\n\nTrigger stood up and faced up to the sequoia. She cupped her hands to\nher mouth, took a deep breath, and yelled. \"Yoo-hoo! Reee-pul-sive!\"\n\nDown in the garden, Mantelish straightened and looked about angrily.\nThen he saw Trigger and smiled.\n\n\"Yoo-hoo yourself, Trigger!\" he shouted, and turned back to his spading.\n\nTrigger watched Pilch's face from the side. She saw her give a sudden\nstart.\n\n\"Great Galaxies!\" Pilch breathed. She kept on looking. \"That's one for\nthe book, isn't it?\" Finally she put the glasses down. She appeared\nsomewhat stunned. \"He really is a little green man!\"\n\n\"Only when he's trying to be. It's a sort of sign of friendliness.\"\n\n\"What's he doing up there?\"\n\n\"He moved over into the sequoia right after we got back,\" Trigger said.\n\"And that's where he'll probably stay indefinitely now. It's just the\nright kind of place for Repulsive.\"\n\n\"Have you been doing any more--well, talking?\"\n\n\"No. Too strenuous both ways. Until a few days before we got back here,\nthere wasn't even a sign from him. He just about knocked himself out on\nthat big plasmoid.\"\n\n\"Who else knows about this?\" asked Pilch.\n\n\"Nobody. I would have told Holati, except he's still mad enough about\nhaving been put into a coma, he might go out and chop the sequoia down.\"\n\n\"Well, it won't go into the report then,\" Pilch said. \"They'd just want\nto bother Repulsive!\"\n\n\"I knew it would be all right to tell you. And here's something else\nvery interesting that's going on at present.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"The real hush-hush reason for Mantelish's expedition,\" Trigger\nexplained, \"is, of course, to scout around this whole area of space with\nplanetary plasmoid detectors. They don't want anybody stumbling on\nanother setup like Harvest Moon and accidentally activating another king\nplasmoid.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Pilch said. \"I'd heard that.\"\n\n\"It was Mantelish's idea,\" said Trigger. \"Now Mantelish is very fond of\nthat sequoia tree. He's got a big, comfortable bench right among its\nroots, where he likes to sit down around noon and have a little nap\nwhen he's out here.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pilch. \"Repulsive's been up to his old tricks, eh?\"\n\n\"Sure. He's given Mantelish very exact instructions. So they're going to\nfind one of those setups, all right. And they won't come back with any\nplasmoids. But they will come back with something they don't know\nabout.\"\n\nPilch looked at her for a moment. \"_You_ say it!\"\n\nTrigger's grin widened. \"A little green woman,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\nCONSIDER THE PLASMOIDS....\n\nAncient living machines that after millennia of stillness suddenly begin\nto move under their own power, for reasons that remain a mystery to men.\nHolati Tate discovered them--then disappeared. Trigger Argee was his\nclosest associate--she means to find him. She's brilliant, beautiful,\nand skilled in every known martial art. She's worth plenty--dead or\nalive--to more than one faction in this obscure battle. And she's\nbeginning to have a chilling notion that the long-vanished Masters of\nthe Old Galaxy were wise when they exiled the plasmoids to the most\ndistant and isolated world they knew....\n\n\nPrinted in U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThe following typographical errors in the original text have been\ncorrected in this eBook:\n\nChapter 1: \"activites\" changed to \"activities\"\n\nChapter 2: \"maker\" changed to \"make\"\n\nChapter 3: \"O.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
