It will\n produce other things, also;\n among them, criminals too\n despicable to live on this\n earth. Too abominable to\n breathe our free air._\n\n\nThe clipped British voice said, in David Houston's ear, _I'm quite sure\nhe's one. He's cashing a check for a thousand pounds. Keep him under\nsurveillance._\n\nHouston didn't look up immediately. He simply stood there in the lobby\nof the big London bank, filling out a deposit slip at one of the long,\nhigh desks. When he had finished, he picked up the slip and headed\ntowards the teller's cage.\n\nAhead of him, standing at the window, was a tall, impeccably dressed,\naristocratic-looking man with graying hair.\n\n\"The man in the tweeds?\" Houston whispered. His voice was so low that it\nwas inaudible a foot away, and his lips scarcely moved. But the\nsensitive microphone in his collar picked up the voice and relayed it to\nthe man behind the teller's wicket.\n\n_That's him_, said the tiny speaker hidden in Houston's ear. _The\nfine-looking chap in the tweeds and bowler._\n\n\"Got him,\" whispered Houston.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe didn't go anywhere near the man in the bowler and tweeds; instead, he\nwent to a window several feet away.\n\n\"Deposit,\" he said, handing the slip to the man on the other side of the\npartition. While the teller went through the motions of putting the\ndeposit through the robot accounting machine, David Houston kept his\nears open.\n\n\"How did you want the thousand, sir?\" asked the teller in the next\nwicket.\n\n\"Ten pound notes, if you please,\" said the graying man. \"I think a\nhundred notes will go into my brief case easily enough.\" He chuckled, as\nthough he'd made a clever witticism.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the clerk, smiling.\n\nHouston whispered into his microphone again. \"Who is the guy?\"\n\nOn the other side of the partition, George Meredith, a small,\nunimposing-looking man, sat at a desk marked: MR. MEREDITH--ACCOUNTING\nDEPT. He looked as though he were paying no attention whatever to\nanything going on at the various windows, but he, too, had a microphone\nat his throat and a hidden pickup in his ear.\n\nAt Houston's question, he whispered: \"That's Sir Lewis Huntley. The\ncheck's good, of course. Poor fellow.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" whispered Houston, \"if he is what we think he is.\"\n\n\"I'm fairly certain,\" Meredith replied. \"Sir Lewis isn't the type of\nfellow to draw that much in cash. At the present rate of exchange,\nthat's worth three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars American.\nSir Lewis might carry a hundred pounds as pocket-money, but never a\nthousand.\"\n\nHouston and Meredith were a good thirty feet from each other, and\nneither looked at the other. Unless a bystander had equipment to tune in\non the special scrambled wavelength they were using, that bystander\nwould never know they were holding a conversation.\n\n\"... nine-fifty, nine-sixty, nine-seventy, nine-eighty, nine-ninety, a\nthousand pounds,\" said the clerk who was taking care of Sir Lewis's\ncheck. \"Would you count that to make sure, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Ten, twenty, thirty, ...\"\n\nWhile the baronet was double-checking the amount, David Houston glanced\nat him. Sir Lewis looked perfectly calm and unhurried, as though he were\ndoing something perfectly legal--which, in a way, he was. And, in\nanother way, he most definitely was not, if George Meredith's suspicions\nwere correct.\n\n\"Your receipt, sir.\" It was the teller at Houston's own window.\n\nHouston took the receipt, thanked the teller, and walked toward the\nbroad front doors of the bank.\n\n\"George,\" he whispered into the throat mike, \"has Sir Lewis noticed me?\"\n\n\"Hasn't so much as looked at you,\" Meredith answered. \"Good hunting.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Houston stepped outside the bank, he casually dropped one hand into a\ncoat pocket and turned a small knob on his radio control box. \"Houston\nto HQ,\" he whispered.\n\n\"London HQ; what is it, Houston?\" asked the earpiece.\n\n\"Leadenhall Street Post. Meredith thinks he's spotted one. Sir Lewis\nHuntley.\"\n\n\"Righto. We've got men in that part of the city now. We'll have a\nnetwork posted within five minutes. Can you hold onto him that long?\"\n\nHouston looked around. Leadenhall Street was full of people, and the\nvisibility was low. \"I'll have to tail him pretty closely,\" Houston\nsaid. \"Your damned English fogs don't give a man much chance to see\nanything.\"\n\nThere was a chuckle from the earphone. \"Cheer up, Yank; you should have\nseen it back before 1968. When atomic power replaced coal and oil, our\nfogs became a devil of a lot cleaner.\"\n\nThe voice was quite clear; at the London headquarters of the UN\nPsychodeviant Police, there was no need to wear a throat mike, which had\na tendency to make the voice sound muffled in spite of the Statistical\nInformation-Bit Samplers which were supposed to clarify the speech\ncoming through them.\n\n\"What do you know about 1968?\" Houston asked sardonically. \"Your mother\nwas still pushing you around in a baby-carriage then.\"\n\n\"In a pram,\" corrected the Headquarters operator. \"That is true, but my\ndear Aunt Jennifer told me all about it. She was--\"\n\n\"The hell with your Aunt Jennifer,\" Houston interrupted suddenly. \"Here\ncomes Sir Lewis. Get me cover--fast!\"\n\n\"Right. Keep us posted.\"\n\nSir Lewis Huntley stepped out of the broad door of the bank and turned\nleft. He took a couple of steps and stopped. He didn't look around; he\nsimply took a cigarette out of a silver case, put it in his mouth, and\nlit it. The glow of the lighter shone yellowly on the brass plate near\nthe door which said: _An Affiliate of Westminster Bank, Ltd._\n\nSir Lewis snapped the light out, drew on the cigarette, and strode on\ndown the street, swinging a blue plastex brief case which contained a\nthousand pounds in United Nations Bank of England notes.\n\nHouston decided the baronet had not been looking for a tail; he wished\nhe could probe the man's mind to make sure, but he knew that would be\nfatal. He'd have to play the game and hope for the best.\n\n\"He's heading east,\" Houston whispered. \"Doesn't look as if he's going\nto get a cab.\"\n\n\"Check,\" said the earphone.\n\nSir Lewis seemed in no great hurry, but he walked briskly, as though he\nhad a definite destination in mind.\n\nAfter a little way, he crossed to the south side of Leadenhall Street\nand kept going east. Houston stayed far enough behind to be above\nsuspicion, but not so far that he ran a chance of losing his man.\n\n\"He's turning south on Fenchurch,\" Houston said a little later. \"I\nwonder where he's going.\"\n\n\"Keep after him,\" said Headquarters. \"Our net men haven't spotted either\nof you yet. They can hardly see across the street in this damned fog.\"\n\nHouston kept going.\n\n\"What the hell?\" he whispered a few minutes later. \"He's still following\nFenchurch Street! He's doubling back!\"\n\nLeadenhall Street, the banking center of the City of London, runs almost\ndue east-and-west; Fenchurch Street makes a forty-five degree angle with\nit at the western end, running southwest for a bit and then curving\ntoward the west, toward Lombard.\n\n\"Houston,\" said HQ, \"touch your left ear.\"\n\nHouston obediently reached up and scratched his left ear.\n\n\"Okay,\" said HQ. \"Bogart's spotted you, but he hasn't spotted Sir Lewis.\nBogart's across the street.\"\n\n\"He can't miss Sir Lewis,\" whispered Houston. \"Conservatively\ndressed--matching coat and trousers of orange nylon tweed--royal blue\nhalf-brim bowler--carrying a blue brief case.\"\n\nThere was a pause, then: \"Yeah. Bogart's spotted him, and so has\nMacGruder. Mac's on your side, a few yards ahead.\"\n\n\"Check. How about the rest of the net?\"\n\n\"Coming, coming. Be patient, old man.\"\n\n\"I _am_ patient,\" growled Houston. _I have to be_, he thought to\nhimself, _otherwise I'd never stay alive_.\n\n\"We've got him bracketed now,\" HQ said. \"If we lose him now, he's a\nmagician.\"\n\nSir Lewis walked on, seemingly oblivious to the group of men who had\nsurrounded him. He came to the end of Fenchurch Street and looked to his\nleft, towards London Bridge. Then he glanced to his right.\n\n\"I think he's looking for a cab,\" Houston whispered.\n\n\"That's what MacGruder says,\" came the reply. \"We've got Arthmore in a\ncab behind you; he'll pick you up. MacGruder will get another cab, and\nwe have a private car for Bogart.\"\n\nSir Lewis flagged a cab, climbed in, and gave an address to the driver.\nHouston didn't hear it, but MacGruder, a heavy-set, short, balding man,\nwas standing near enough to get the instructions Sir Lewis had given to\nthe driver.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA cab pulled up to the curb near Houston, and he got in.\n\nArthmore, the driver, was a thin, tall, hawknosed individual who could\nhave played Sherlock Holmes on TV. Once he got into character for a\npart, he never got out of it unless absolutely necessary. Right now, he\nwas a Cockney cab-driver, and he would play the part to the hilt.\n\n\"Where to, guv'nor?\" he asked innocently.\n\n\"Buckingham Palace,\" said Houston. \"I've got a poker appointment with\nPrince Charles.\"\n\n\"Blimey, guv'nor,\" said Arthmore. \"You _are_ movin' in 'igh circles!\n'Ow's 'Er Majesty these days?\"\n\nThe turboelectric motor hummed, and the cab shot off into traffic.\n\"According to the report I get on the blinkin' wireless,\" he continued,\n\"a chap named MacGruder claims that the eminent Sir Lewis 'Untley is\n'eaded for Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews.\"\n\n\"One of these days,\" said Houston, \"all those _H_'s you drop is going to\nbounce back and hit you in the face.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, Mr. Yewston?\" Arthmore asked blankly.\n\nHouston grinned. \"Nothing, cabbie; it's just that you remind me of a\ncultured, intelligent fellow named Jack Arthmore. The only difference is\nthat Jack speaks the Queen's English.\"\n\n\"Crikey!\" said Arthmore. \"Wot a coincidence!\" He paused, then: \"The\nQueen's English, you say? She _'as_ to be, don't she?\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said Houston conversationally. \"And give me a cigarette,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"There's a package of Players in my shirt pocket,\" Arthmore said,\nkeeping his hands on the wheel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston fished out a cigarette, lit it, and returned the pack.\n\nApropos of nothing, Arthmore said: \"Reminds me of the time I was workin'\nfor a printer, see? We 'ad to print up a bunch of 'andbills advertisin'\na church charity bazaar. Down at the bottom was supposed to be printed\n'Under the auspices of St. Bede's-on-Thames.' So I--\"\n\nHe went on with a long, rambling tale about making a mistake in printing\nthe handbill. Houston paid little attention. He smoked in silence,\nkeeping his eyes on the red glow of the taillight ahead of them.\n\nNeither man mentioned the approaching climax of the chase. Even hardened\nveterans of the Psychodeviant Police don't look forward to the\npossibility of having their minds taken over, controlled by some outside\nforce.\n\nIt had never happened to Houston, but he knew that Arthmore had been\nthrough the experience once. It evidently wasn't pleasant.\n\n\"--and the boss was 'oppin' mad,\" Arthmore was saying, \"but, crikey, 'ow\nwas I to know that _auspice_ was spelled A-U-S-P-I-C-E?\"\n\nHouston grinned. \"Yeah, sure. How're we doing with Sir Lewis?\"\n\n\"Seems to be headed in the right direction,\" Arthmore said, suddenly\ndropping the Cockney accent. \"This is the route I'd take if I were\nheaded for Upper Berkeley Mews. He probably hasn't told the driver to\nchange addresses--maybe he won't.\"\n\n\"The victims never do,\" Houston said. \"He probably is actually headed\ntoward Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Nobody's perfect,\" said Arthmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForty-five minutes of steady progress through the streets of Greater\nLondon brought Sir Lewis Huntley to Upper Berkeley and to the short\ndead-end street which constituted the Mews. By the time the dapper\nbaronet stepped out of the machine and paid his driver, the whole area\nwas surrounded by and filled with the well-armed, silent, and careful\nagents of the Psychodeviant Police.\n\nNumber 37 was an old concrete-and-steel structure of the George VI\nperiod, faced with a veneer of red brick. It had obviously been\nremodeled at least once to make the fa\u00e7ade more modern and more\nfashionable; the red-violet anodized aluminum was relatively fresh and\nunstained. It wouldn't have taken vast wealth to rent a flat in the\nbuilding, but neither would an average income have been quite enough.\n\nHouston looked out of the window of Arthmore's cab and glanced at the\ntiers of windows in the building. Presumably, the man they were looking\nfor was up there--somewhere.\n\n_So you occupy a station in the upper middle-class_, thought Houston. It\nchecked. Every bit of evidence that came his way seemed to check\nperfectly and fit neatly into the hypothesis which he had formed. Soon\nit would be time to test that theory--but the time had not yet come.\n\n\"Stand by and wait for orders, Houston,\" said the speaker in Houston's\near. \"We've got men inside the building.\"\n\nSir Lewis Huntley opened the sparkling, translucent door of Number 37\nUpper Berkeley Mews and went inside.\n\nArthmore pulled the cab over to the curb a few yards from the entrance\nand the two men waited in silence. All around them were other men, some\nin private cars, some walking slowly along the street. All of them were\npart of the net that had gathered to catch one man.\n\n_Poor fish_, Houston thought wryly.\n\nThere was no noise, no excitement. Five minutes after Sir Lewis had\nentered the front door, it opened again. A man whom Houston had never\nseen before stepped out and gestured with one hand. At the same time,\nHouston's speaker said: \"They've got him. Hit him with a stun gun when\nhe tried to get out through the fire exit.\"\n\nAn ambulance which had been waiting at the entrance of the Mews pulled\nup in front of Number 37, and a minute or so later a little clot of men\ncame out bearing a stretcher, which was loaded into the ambulance.\nImmediately after them came another man who had a firm, but polite grip\non the arm of Sir Lewis Huntley.\n\nHouston sighed and leaned back in his seat. That was that. It was all\nover. Simple. Nothing to it.\n\nAnother Controller had been apprehended by the Psychodeviant Police.\nAnother deviant, already tried and found guilty, was ready to be exiled\nfrom Earth and imprisoned on one of the Penal Asteroids. All in the\nday's work.\n\n_There's just one thing I'd like to know_, Houston thought blackly.\n_What in the hell's going on?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his hotel room near Piccadilly Circus, several hours later, David\nHouston sat alone, drink in hand, and put that same question to himself\nagain.\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nOn the face of it, it was simple. On the face of it, the answer was\nright in front of him, printed in black and white on the front page of\nthe evening _Times_.\n\nHouston lifted the paper off the bed and looked at it. The banner line\nsaid: _Controller Captured in Lambeth!_\n\nBeneath that, in smaller type, the headline added: Robert Harris Accused\nof Taking Control of Barrister Sir Lewis Huntley.\n\nThe column itself told the whole story. Mr. Robert Harris, of No. 37\nUpper Berkeley Mews, had, by means of mental control, taken over the\nmind of Sir Lewis and compelled him to draw one thousand pounds out of\nhis bank. While Sir Lewis was returning to Harris with the money, the\nUnited Nations Psychodeviant Police had laid a trap. Sir Lewis, upon\nrecovering his senses when Harris was rendered unconscious by a stun\ngun, had given evidence to the PD Police and to officials at New\nScotland Yard.\n\nHouston looked at the full-color photo of Harris that was printed\nalongside the column. Nice-looking chap; late twenties or early\nthirties, Houston guessed. Blond-red hair, blue eyes. All-in-all, a\nvery pleasant, but ordinary sort of man.\n\nThere had been evidence that a Controller had been at work in London for\nsome weeks now. Twelve days before, several men, following an impulse,\nhad mailed twenty pounds to a \"Richard Hempstead,\" General Delivery,\nWaterloo Station. By the time the matter had come to the authorities'\nattention, the envelopes had been called for and the Controller had\nescaped.\n\nRobert Harris was not the first Controller to be captured, nor, Houston\nknew, would he be the last. The first one had shown up more than sixteen\nyears before, in Dallas, Texas, USA.\n\nHouston grinned as he thought of it. Projective telepathy had only been\na crackpot's idea back then. In spite of the work of many intelligent,\nsane men, who had shown that mental powers above and beyond the ordinary\ndid exist, the average man simply laughed off such nonsense. It was\nmysticism; it was magic; it was foolish superstition. It was anything\nbut true.\n\nBut ever since \"Blackjack\" Donnely had practically taken control of the\nwhole city of Dallas, the average man had changed his mind. It was still\nmysterious; it was still magic; but now the weird machinations of the\nsupernormal mind were something to be feared.\n\nIn the sixteen years that had ensued since the discovery of the abnormal\nmental powers of \"Blackjack\" Donnely, rumors had spread all over the\nworld. There were supposed to be men who could levitate--fly through the\nair at will. Others could walk through walls, and still others could\nmake themselves invisible. The horrible monsters that were supposed to\nbe walking the Earth were legion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nActually, only one type of supernormal psychodeviant had been found--the\ntelepath, the mindreader who could probe into the mental processes of\nothers. Worse than that, the telepath could project his own thoughts\ninto the mind of another, so that the victim supposed that the thoughts\nwere his own. Actually, it was a high-powered form of hypnotism; the\nvictim could be made to do anything the projective telepath wanted him\nto.\n\n\"Blackjack\" Donnely had made that clear in his trial in Texas.\n\nDonnely had been a big man--big physically, and important in city\npolitics. He had also been as arrogant as the Devil himself.\n\nIt was the arrogance that had finally tripped up Donnely. He had thought\nhimself impregnable. Haled into court on charges of misappropriation of\npublic funds, he had just sat and smirked while several witnesses for\nthe State admitted that they had aided Donnely, but they claimed he had\n\"hypnotized\" them. Donnely didn't try to interfere with the\nevidence--that's where he made his mistake. And that's where his\narrogance tripped him up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf he'd used telepathic projection to influence the State Attorney or\nthe witnesses or the judge or the Grand Jury _before_ the trial, he\nmight never have been discovered as the first of the Controllers. But\nthat wasn't Donnely's style.\n\n\"None of this namby-pamby stuff,\" he had once been quoted as saying; \"if\nyou got enemies, don't tease 'em--show 'em who's running things.\nBlackjack 'em, if you have to.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what \"Blackjack\" Donnely had done. The trial was a\nfarce from beginning to end; each witness gave his evidence from the\nstand, and then Donnely took control of their minds and made them refute\nevery bit of it, publicly and tearfully apologizing to the \"wonderful\nMr. Donnely\" for saying such unkind things about him.\n\nThe judge and the jury knew something funny was going on, but they had\nno evidence, one way or another. The case, even at that point, might\nhave ended with an acquittal or a hung jury, but Donnely wasn't through\nusing his blackjack.\n\nHe took over the mind of the foreman of the jury. The foreman claimed\nlater that the jury had decided that they could reach no decision. Other\njurors claimed that they had decided Donnely was guilty, but that was\nprobably an _ex post facto_ switch. It didn't matter, anyway; when the\nforeman came out, he pronounced Donnely innocent. That should have ended\nit.\n\nThe other jurors began to protest, but by that time, Donnely had gained\ncontrol of the judge's mind. Rapidly, the judge silenced the jurors,\ndeclared Donnely to be free, and then publicly apologized for ever\ndaring to doubt Mr. Donnely.\n\nThe State's Attorney was equally verbose in his apology; he was almost\nin tears because of his \"deep contrition at having cast aspersions on\nthe spotless character of so great a man.\"\n\nDonnely was released.\n\nThe next evening, \"Blackjack\" Donnely was shot down at the front door of\nhis own home. There were fifteen bullets in his body; three from a .32,\nfive from a .38, and seven from a .45.\n\nThe police investigation was far from thorough; any evidence that may\nhave turned up somehow got lost. It was labelled as \"homicide committed\nby person or persons unknown,\" and it stayed that way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonnely was only the first. In the next two years, four more showed up.\nEveryone of them, in one way or another, had attempted to gain power or\nmoney by mental projection. Everyone of them was a twisted megalomaniac.\n\nHouston looked again at Harris's picture on the front page of the\n_Times_. Here was one Controller who neither looked nor acted like a\nmegalomaniac. That wouldn't make much difference to the PD Police; as\nfar as the officials were concerned, the ability to project\ntelepathically and the taint of delusions of grandeur went hand in hand.\nControllers were power-mad and criminal by definition.\n\nFear still ruled the emotional reactions against Controllers, in spite\nof the protection of the Psychodeviant Police.\n\nBut David Houston knew damned good and well that all telepaths were not\nnecessarily insane.\n\nHe should know. He was a Controller, himself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Brrrring!_\n\nDavid Houston tossed the paper on the bed and walked over to the phone.\nHe cut in the circuit, and waited for the phone's TV screen to show the\nface of his caller. But the screen remained blank.\n\n\"Who is it?\" Houston asked.\n\n\"Is this CHAring Cross 7-8161?\" It was a woman's voice, soft and\nwell-modulated.\n\n\"No, this is CHElsea 7-8161,\" Houston said. \"You must have dialed C-H-E\ninstead of C-H-A.\"\n\n\"Oh. I'm very sorry. Excuse me.\" There was a click, and she hung up.\n\nHouston walked back over to the bed and picked up his paper. He looked\nat it, but he didn't read it. It no longer interested him.\n\nSo Dorrine was finally in London, eh? He'd recognized her voice\ninstantly; even years of training couldn't smother the midwestern\nAmerican of Chicago completely beneath the precise British of the\nwell-educated English girl.\n\nThe signal had been agreed upon, just in case his phone was tapped. Even\nthe Psychodeviant Police could be suspected of harboring a\nController--although Houston didn't think it too likely. Nevertheless,\nhe wasn't one to take too many chances.\n\nHe glanced at his watch. He had an hour yet. He'd wait five minutes\nbefore he phoned headquarters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sat down in his chair again and forced himself to relax, smoke a\ncigarette, and read the paper--the sports section. Perusing the records\nof the season's cricket matches kept his mind off that picture on the\nfront page. At least, he hoped they would. Let's see, now--Benton was\nbeing rated as the finest googly bowler on the Staffordshire Club ...\n\nEverything went fine until he came across a reference to a John Harris,\na top-flight batsman for Hambledon; that reminded him of Robert Harris.\nHouston threw down the paper in disgust and walked over to the phone.\n\nThe number was TROwbridge 5-4321, but no one ever bothered to remember\nit. Simply dial 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, and every time a voice at the other end\nwould answer--\n\n\"Hamilton speaking.\"\n\n\"Houston here; will I be needed in the next hour or so?\"\n\n\"Mmmm. Just a second; I'll check the roster. No; your evidence won't be\nneeded personally. You've filed an affidavit. No, I don't think--wait a\nminute! Yes, there's a return here for you; reservation on the six A.M.\njet to New York. Your job here is done, Houston, so you can take the\nrest of the evening off and relax. Going anywhere in particular?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd get a bite to eat and take in a movie, maybe, but if I'm\ndue out at six, I'll forego the cinematic diversion. When's the trial?\"\n\n\"It's scheduled for eleven-thirty this evening. Going to come?\"\n\nHouston shook his head. \"Not if I'm not needed to give evidence. Those\nControllers always give me the creeps.\"\n\n\"They do everybody,\" said Hamilton. \"Well, you caught him; there's no\nneed for you to stick around for the windup. Have a good time.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Houston shortly, and hung up.\n\n_The windup_, Houston thought. _Sure. That's all it will be. A\nController's trial is a farce. Knock him out with a stun gun and then\npump him full of comatol. How can he defend himself if he's unconscious\nall through the trial?_\n\nHouston knew what the average man's answer to that would be: \"If a\nController were allowed to remain conscious, he'd take over the judge's\nmind and get himself freed.\"\n\nHouston said an obscene word under his breath, jammed his hat on his\nhead, put on his coat, and left his apartment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the coming of darkness, the heavy fog had become still denser. The\nyellow beams of the sodium vapor lamps were simply golden spots hanging\nin an all-enveloping blackness. Walking the street was a process of\nmoving from one little golden island of light to another, crossing seas\nof blankness between. The monochromatic yellow shone on the human faces\nthat passed beneath the lamps, robbing them of all color, giving them a\ndead, grayish appearance beneath the yellow itself.\n\nDavid Houston walked purposefully along the pavement, his hand jammed\ndeep in his overcoat pockets. One hand held the control box for the\nlittle earpiece he wore. He kept moving the band selector, listening for\nany sign that the Psychodeviant Police were suspicious of a Controller\nin their midst.\n\nIf they were following him, of course, they would use a different\nscrambler circuit than the one which was plugged into his own unit, but\nhe would be able to hear the gabble of voices, even if he couldn't\nunderstand what they were saying.\n\nSo far, there hadn't been a sound; if he was being followed, his tailers\nweren't using the personal intercom units.\n\nHe didn't try to elude anyone who might be following. That, in itself,\nwould be a giveaway. Let them watch, if they _were_ watching. They\nwouldn't see anything but a man going to get himself a bit of dinner.\n\nThe _Charles II Inn_, on Regent Street, near Piccadilly Circus, was a\nhaven of brightness in an otherwise Stygian London. It was one of those\n\"old-fashioned\" places--Restoration style of decoration, carried out in\nmodern plastics. The oak panelling looked authentic enough, but it was\njust a little too glossy to be real.\n\nHouston pushed open the door, stepped inside, removed his hat and coat\nand shook the dampness from them. As he handed them to the checker, he\nlooked casually around. Dorrine was nowhere in sight, but he hadn't\nexpected her to be. There would be no point in their meeting physically;\nit might even be downright dangerous.\n\nThe headwaiter, clad in the long waistcoat and full trunk-hose of the\nlate Seventeenth Century, bowed punctiliously.\n\n\"You're alone, sir?\"\n\n\"Alone, yes,\" Houston said. \"I'll just be wanting a light supper and a\ndrink or two.\"\n\n\"This way, sir.\"\n\nHouston followed the man to a small table in the rear of the huge dining\nroom. It was set for two, but the other place was quickly cleared away.\nHouston ordered an Irish-and-soda from a waiter who was only slightly\nless elaborately dressed than the headwaiter, and then settled himself\ndown to wait. If he knew Dorrine, she would be on time to the minute.\n\nShe came while the waiter was setting the drink on Houston's table. She\nstepped in through the door, her unmistakable hair glowing a rich red in\nthe illumination of the pseudo-candlelight.\n\nShe didn't bother to look around; she knew he would be there.\n\nAfter a single glance, Houston averted his eyes from her and looked back\nat his drink.\n\nAnd in that same instant, their minds touched.\n\n_Dave, darling! I knew you'd be early!_\n\n_Dorrine!_\n\nAnd then their minds meshed for an instant.\n\n_I_--_(we)_--_you_--LOVE--_you_--(each other)--me!--us!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston looked complacently at his drink while the headwaiter led\nDorrine to a table on the far side of the room. She sat down gracefully,\nsmiled at the waiter, and ordered a cocktail. Then she took a magazine\nfrom her handbag and began--presumably--to read.\n\nHer thought came: _Who is this Richard Harris? He's not one of our\nGroup._\n\nHouston sipped at his drink. _No. An unknown, like the others. I wonder\nif he's even a telepath._\n\n_What?_ Her thought carried astonishment. _Why, Dave--he'd_ have _to be!\nHow else could he have controlled this Sir Lewis--whatsisname--Huntley?_\n\n_Well--I've got a funny idea_, Houston replied. _Look at it this way: So\nfar as we know, there are two Groups of telepaths. There's our own\nGroup. All we want is to be left alone. We don't read a Normal's mind\nunless we have to, and we don't try to control one unless our lives are\nthreatened. We stay under cover, out of everyone's way._\n\n_Then there are the megalomaniacs. They try, presumably, to gain wealth\nand power by controlling Normals. And they get caught with monotonous\nregularity. Right?_\n\nThe girl caught an odd note in that thought. _What do you mean,\n\"monotonous regularity\"?_ she asked.\n\n_I mean_, Houston thought savagely, _why is it they're all so bloody\nstupid? Look at this Harris guy; he is supposed to have taken over Sir\nLewis's mind in order to get a thousand pounds. So what did he have Sir\nLewis do? Parade all around the city to pick up a PD Police net, and\nthen give his address to a cabman in a loud voice and lead the whole\nnet right to Harris! How stupid can a man get?_\n\n_It does look pretty silly_, Dorrine agreed. _Have you got an\nexplanation?_\n\n_Several_, Houston told her. _And I don't know which one is correct._\n\n_Let's have them_, the girl thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston gave them to her. None of them, he knew, was completely\nsatisfactory, but they all made more sense that the theory that Harris\nhad done what the PD Police claimed he'd done.\n\nTheory Number One: The real megalomaniac Controller had taken over Sir\nLewis's mind and made him draw out the thousand pounds and head west on\nLeadenhall Street. Somehow, the Controller had found out that Sir Lewis\nwas being followed, and had steered him away from the original\ndestination, heading him toward the innocent Robert Harris. That implied\nthat the Controller had been within a few dozen yards of the net men\nthat afternoon. A Controller can't control a mind directly from a\ndistance, although orders can be implanted which will cause a man to\ncarry out a plan of action, even though he may be miles from the\nController. But in order to change those plans, the Controller would\nhave to be within projection range.\n\nTheory Two: Robert Harris actually was a megalomaniac Controller; with a\nlong record of success behind him, who had finally grown careless.\n\nAt that point, Dorrine interjected a thought: _Isn't it possible that he\nwanted to be caught?_\n\nHouston mulled it over for a minute. _A guilt-punishment reaction? He\nwanted to be punished for his crimes? I suppose that might account for\npart of it, yes. But if he'd been so successful, what did he do with all\nhis money?_\n\nDorrine gave a mental shrug. _Who knows? What's Theory Number Three?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNumber Three was the screwiest one of all, yet it made a weird kind of\nsense. Suppose that Sir Lewis himself had had a grudge against Harris?\nThe whole thing would have been ridiculously easy; all he'd have to do\nwould be to act just as he had acted and then give evidence against\nHarris.\n\nThe thing that made it odd wasn't the actual frame-up (if that's what it\nwas); these days, every crime was blamed on a Controller. A man accused\nof murder simply looked virtuous and said that he would never have done\nsuch a thing if he hadn't been under the power of a Controller. Ditto\nfor robbery, rape, and any other felony you'd care to name.\n\nAn aura of fear hung over the whole Earth; each man half suspected\neveryone with whom he came in contact of being a Controller.\n\nSo it wasn't that the frame-up in itself was peculiar in this case; it\nwas simply that it wasn't Sir Lewis Huntley's style. If Sir Lewis had\nwanted to get Harris, he'd have done it legally, without any underhanded\nframe-ups. Still, the theory remained as a possibility.\n\n_I suppose it does_, Dorrine agreed, _but how does that tie in with our\nown Group? What about Jackson and Marcy? What happened to them?_\n\n_I don't know_, Houston admitted, _I just don't know_.\n\nJackson and Marcy had been members of the Group of telepaths who had\nbanded together for companionship and mutual protection. Both of them\nhad been trapped by the PD Police in exactly the same way that Harris\nhad been trapped. They were now where Harris would be in a matter of\nhours--in the Penal Cluster.\n\nTheir arrests didn't make sense, either; they had been accused of taking\nover someone's mind for the purpose of gaining money illegally--illegal,\nthat is, according to the new UN laws that had been passed to supersede\nthe various national laws that had previously been in effect.\n\nBut Houston had known both men well, and neither of them was the kind of\nman who would pull such a stunt, much less do it in such a stupid\nmanner.\n\nDorrine thought: _Well, Dave, this Harris case is out of our hands now;\nwe've got to concentrate on getting others into the Group--we've got to\nfind the other sane ones._\n\n_You're ready to take over here, then?_ he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the table, several yards away from where Houston was sitting,\nDorrine, still looking at the book, smiled faintly.\n\n_I'll have to; you're being transferred back to New York at six in the\nmorning._\n\nHouston allowed a feeling of startled surprise to bridge the gap between\ntheir minds. _How'd you know that?_ He hadn't told her, and she couldn't\nhave forced the knowledge from his mind. A telepath can open the mind\nof a Normal as simply as he might open the pages of a book, but the mind\nof another Controller is far stronger. One telepath couldn't force\nanything from the mind of another; all thoughts had to be exchanged\nvoluntarily.\n\nShe was still smiling. _We've got a few spies in the UN now_, she told\nhim. _I got the information before you did._\n\n_You knew before you left New York?_ he asked incredulously.\n\n_That's right_, she thought. _The decision was made last night. Why?_\n\n_Nothing_, he told her. _I was just surprised, that's all._ But deep\nbehind the telepathic barrier he had erected against her probing mind,\nhe was thinking something else. He had been assigned to London to\ncapture the Controller--then unknown--who was said to be active in\nEngland. But his recall order had been decided upon _before_ Harris was\ncaught--or even suspected. Someone in the UN Psychodeviant Police\nSupreme Headquarters in New York must have known that Harris would be\ncaught that day!\n\n_Something's bothering you_, Dorrine stated flatly.\n\n_I was thinking about leaving London_, he replied evasively. _I haven't\nseen you for six months, and now I have to leave again._\n\n_I'll be back in New York within three weeks_, the girl thought warmly.\n_I'll be--_\n\nHer thoughts were cut off suddenly by a strident voice in Houston's ear.\n\"Attention; all-band notice. Robert Bentley Harris, arraigned this\nevening on a charge of illegal use of psychodeviant powers for the\npurpose of compounding a felony, has been found guilty as charged. He\nwas therefore sentenced by the Lord Justice of Her Majesty's Court of\nStar Chamber to be banished from Earth forever, such banishment to be\ncarried out by the United Nations Penology Service at the Queen's\npleasure.\"\n\nThe words that were running through Houston's brain, had been\ntransmitted easily to Dorrine. For a moment, neither of them made any\ncomment. Then Houston glanced at his watch.\n\n_Twenty-one minutes_, he thought bitterly. _What took them so long?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHigh in the thin ionosphere, seventy miles above the surface of the\nEarth, a fifteen-hundred-mile-an-hour rocket airliner winged its way\nwestward across the Atlantic, pushing herself forward on the thin,\nwhispering, white-hot jets of her atomic engine. Behind her, the\noutdistanced sun sank slowly below the eastern horizon.\n\nDavid Houston wasn't watching the sunrise-in-reverse; he was sitting\nquietly in his seat, still trying to puzzle out his queer recall to New\nYork. When Hamilton had told him about it over the phone, he'd assumed\nthat New York, having been notified that Harris had been captured, had\ndecided to send for Houston, now that his job was over.\n\nBut now he knew that the order had come through nearly twenty-four hours\nbefore Harris was captured.\n\nDid someone at UN Headquarters know that Harris was going to be\ncaptured? Or did someone there suspect that there was something odd\nabout Police Operative David Houston?\n\nOr both?\n\nWhatever it was, Houston would have to take his chances; to act\nsuspiciously would be a deadly mistake.\n\nA stewardess, clad in the chic BOAC uniform, moved down the aisle,\nquietly informing the passengers that they could have coffee served at\ntheir seats or take breakfast in the lounge. The atmosphere of the\nplane's interior was filled with the low murmur of a hundred\nconversations against the background of the susurrant mutter of the\nmighty engines.\n\n_Uhhh--uh--uh--dizzy--head hurts--uh--uh--_\n\nThe sounds in the plane altered subtly as the faint thought insinuated\nitself on every brain inside the aircraft. None of the Normal passengers\nrecognized it for what it was; it was too gentle, too weak, to be\nrecognized directly by their minds.\n\nBut David Houston recognized it instantly for what it was.\n\nSomewhere on the plane, a Controller had been unconscious. _Had_ been.\nFor now, his powerful mind was trying to swim up from the black depths\nof nothingness.\n\n_Uh--uhhhh--uhh--_\n\nThe Normal passengers became uneasy, not knowing why they were\ndisturbed. To them, it was like a vaguely unpleasant but totally\nunrecognizable nudge from their own subconscious, like some\nlong-forgotten and deeply buried memory that had been forced down into\noblivion and was now trying to obtrude itself on the conscious mind.\n\n_Uhhh--Oooohh--where?--what happened?--_\n\nA fully conscious telepath could project his thoughts along a narrow\nlocus, focusing them on a single brain, leaving all other brains\noblivious to his thoughts. Like a TV broadcasting station, he could\nchoose his wavelength and stick to it.\n\nBut a half-conscious Controller sprayed his thoughts at random, creating\nmental disturbances in his vicinity. Like a thunderstorm creating radio\nstatic, there was no selectivity.\n\nSavagely, David Houston did what he had to do. It might be a trap, but\nhe had to avoid the carnage that might follow if this went on. He hurled\na beam of thought, hard-held, at the offending mind of the awakening\ntelepath.\n\n_DON'T THINK! RELAX!_\n\nNormally it was impossible for a Controller to take over the mind of\nanother Controller, but these were abnormal circumstances; the\nhalf-conscious man, whoever he was, was weakened mentally by some kind\nof enforced unconsciousness--either a drug or a stun gun. Houston took\nover his mind smoothly and easily.\n\n_Robert Harris!_\n\nHouston recognized the mind as soon as he held it.\n\nHe didn't try to force anything on Harris's mind; he simply held it,\ncradling it, helping Harris to regain consciousness easily, bringing him\nup from the darkness gently.\n\nIn normal sleep, everyone's mind retains a certain amount of\nself-control and awareness of environment. If it didn't, noise and\nbright lights wouldn't awaken a sleeping person.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn normal sleep, a telepath retained enough control to keep his thoughts\nto himself, even when waking up.\n\nBut total anaesthesia brought on a mental blackout from which the victim\nrecovered only with effort. And during that time, a Controller's mind\nwas violently disturbing to the Normal minds around him, who mistook his\ndisordered thoughts for their own.\n\nLike pouring heavy oil on choppy waters, Houston soothed the\ndisturbances of Harris's mind, focusing the random broadcasts on his own\nbrain.\n\nAnd while he did that, he probed gently into the weakened mind of the\nprisoner for information.\n\nHarris was a Controller, all right; there was no doubt about that. But\nnowhere in his mind was there any trace of any knowledge of what had\nhappened to Sir Lewis Huntley. If Sir Lewis had actually been\ncontrolled, it hadn't been done by Robert Harris.\n\nHouston wished he'd been able to probe Sir Lewis's mind; he'd have been\nable to get a lot more information out of it than he had in his\npossession now. But that would have been dangerous; if Sir Lewis was a\nController himself, and had been acting a part, Houston would have given\nhimself away the instant he attempted to touch the baronet's mind. If,\non the other hand, Sir Lewis had actually been under the control of\nanother telepath, any probing into the mind of the puppet would have\nbetrayed Houston to the real Controller.\n\nHarris knew nothing. He wasn't acquainted with any other Controllers,\nand had kept his nose clean ever since he'd discovered his latent\npowers. He knew that megalomaniac Controllers were either captured or\nmobbed, and he had no wish to experience either.\n\nThe Normals had long since discovered that the only way to overcome a\nController was by force of numbers. A Controller could only hold one\nNormal mind at a time. That was why a mob could easily kill a single\nController; that was why the Psychodeviant Police had evolved the \"net\"\nsystem for arresting a telepath.\n\nHarris, then, had been framed. Or could it be called a frame-up when\nHarris was really guilty of the actual crime? Because the crime he had\nreally been accused of was not that of controlling Sir Lewis, but the\ncrime of being a telepath. That, and that alone, damned him in the eyes\nof the Normals; the crime of taking over a mind for gain was incidental.\nThe stigma lies in what he _was_, not what he did.\n\nHarris himself was in the bottom of the plane, in the baggage section\nnear the landing gear. After his trial, still drugged, he had been\nsecretly put aboard, to be taken to the Long Island Spaceport in New\nYork. It had had to be secret; no Normal would knowingly ride on an\naircraft which carried a Controller, even if he were drugged into total\nunconsciousness.\n\nWith Harris were two PD Police guards. Their low conversation impinged\non Harris's ears, and was transmitted to Houston's mind.\n\nSuddenly, one of them said: \"Hey! He's moving!\"\n\n\"Better give him another shot, Harry;\" said the other, \"when those guys\nwake up, they drive you crazy.\"\n\nHouston could almost feel the sting of the needle as it was inserted\ninto the arm of the helpless prisoner.\n\nSlowly, Harris's thoughts, which had begun to become fully coherent,\nagain became chaotic, finally sliding off into silence and darkness.\n\n\"Are you all right, sir?\"\n\nHouston looked up from his intense concentration. The stewardess was\nstanding by his seat. He realized that there was a film of perspiration\non his brow, and that he probably had looked dazed while he was\nconcentrating on Harris's mind.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said quickly, \"I'm all right. I'm just a little tired. Had to\nget up too early to catch this plane.\" He rubbed his forehead. \"I do\nhave a little headache; would you happen to have any aspirin aboard?\"\n\nShe smiled professionally. \"Certainly, sir. I'll get a couple of\ntablets.\"\n\nAs she left for the first-aid cabinet, Houston thought bleakly to\nhimself: _Harris was framed. Possibly others have been, too. But by\nwhom? And why?_\n\nHe could see why a Normal might do such a thing. But why would a\nController do it?\n\nThere was only one answer. Somewhere, there was a Controller, or a group\nof Controllers who were megalomaniacs _par excellence_. If that were so,\nhe--or they--could make the late \"Blackjack\" Donnely look like a meek,\nharmless, little mouse.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe one part of Continental U.S.A. over which the American Government\nhad no jurisdiction was small, areawise, in comparison with its power.\nThe District of the United Nations occupied the small area of Manhattan\nIsland which ran from 38th Street on the south to 49th Street on the\nnorth; its western border was Third Avenue, its eastern, the East River.\nFrom here, the UN ruled Earth.\n\nThere were no walls or fences around it; only by looking at street signs\ncould anyone tell that they had crossed an international border.\nCrossing Third Avenue from west to east, one found that 45th Street had\nsuddenly become Deutschland Strasse; 40th Street became Rue de France;\n47th was the Via Italiano. 43rd Street's sign was painted in Cyrillic\ncharacters, but beneath it, in English, were the words \"Avenue of Mother\nRussia.\"\n\nThird Avenue was technically One World Drive. Second Avenue was labelled\nas Planetary Peace Drive, and First was United Nations Drive.\n\nBut New Yorkers are, and always have been, diehards. Just as The Avenue\nof the Americas had forever remained Sixth Avenue, no matter what the\nmaps called it, so had the other streets retained their old names in\nconversation.\n\nEven the International Post Office, after years of wrangling, had given\nup, and letters addressed to _Supreme Headquarters, United Nations\nPolice, 45th Street at Second Avenue_, were delivered without comment,\neven though the IPO still firmly held that they were technically\nmisaddressed. And, privately, even the IPO officials admitted that the\nnumbers were easier to say and remember than the polyglot street names\nthat had been tagged on by the General Assembly.\n\nSo when David Houston signalled a taxi at Grand Central Station and\nsaid, \"Forty-fifth and Second,\" the driver simply set his automatic\ncontrols, leaned back in his seat, and said, \"Goin' to see the cops,\nhuh?\"\n\nWhen no answer was forthcoming, the driver turned around and took a good\nlook at his passenger. \"Maybe you're a UN cop yourself, huh?\"\n\nHouston shook his head. \"Nope. Some kids have been scribbling dirty\nwords on my sidewalk, and I'm going to report it to the authorities.\"\n\nThe driver turned back around and looked ahead again. \"Jeez! That's\nserious. Hadn't you better take it up with the Secretary General? I\nwouldn't be satisfied with no underlings in a case like that.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of taking it up with the Atomic Energy Control Board,\"\nHouston told him. \"I think those kids are using radioactive chalk.\"\n\n\"That's one way for 'em to get blue jeans,\" said the driver cryptically.\n\nThere was silence for a moment as the taxi braked smoothly to a halt,\nguided and controlled by the automatic machinery in the hood.\n\nThen, suddenly, the driver said: \"Ship up!\" He pointed east, along 45th\nStreet, toward Long Island. Far in the distance was a rapidly rising\nvapor trail, pointing vertically toward the sky, the unmistakable sign\nof a spaceship takeoff. They didn't leave often, and it was still an\nunusual sight.\n\nHouston said nothing as he climbed out and paid the driver, tossing in\nan extra tip.\n\n\"Thanks, buddy,\" said the driver. \"Watch out for them kids.\"\n\nHouston didn't answer. He was still watching the vapor trail as the cab\npulled away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_There goes Harris_, he was thinking. _An innocent man, guilty of\nnothing more than being born different. And because of that, he's\nlabelled as an inhuman monster, not even worthy of being executed.\nInstead, he's taken into space, filled full of hibernene, and chained to\na floating piece of rock for the rest of his life._\n\nSuch was humanity's \"humane\" way of taking care of the bogey of\nControllers. Capital punishment had been outlawed all over Earth; it had\nlong since been proved that legalized murder, execution by the State,\nsolved nothing, helped no one, prevented no crimes, and did infinitely\nmore harm than good in the long run.\n\nWith the coming of the Controllers, a movement had arisen to bring back\nthe old evil of judicial murder, but it had been quickly put down when\nthe Penal Cluster plan had been put forth as a more \"humane\" method.\n\nHibernene was a drug that had been evolved from the study of animals\nlike the bear, which spent its winters in an almost death-like sleep. A\nhuman being, given a proper dosage of the drug, lapsed into a deep coma.\nThe bodily processes were slowed down; the heart throbbed sluggishly,\nonce every few minutes; thought ceased. It was the ideal prison for a\nmental offender that ordinary prisons could not hold.\n\nBut it wasn't quite enough for the bloodthirsty desire for vengeance\nthat the Normals held for the Controllers. There had to be more.\n\nFollowing Earth in its orbit around the sun, trailing it by some\nninety-three million miles, were a group of tiny asteroids, occupying\nwhat is known as the Trojan position. They were invisible from Earth,\nbeing made of dark rock and none of them being more than fifteen feet in\ndiameter. But they had been a source of trouble in some of the early\nexpeditions to Mars, and had been carefully charted by the Space\nCommission.\n\nNow a use had been found for them. A man in a spacesuit could easily be\nchained to one of them. With him was a small, sun-powered engine and\ntanks of liquified food concentrates and oxygen. Kept under the\ninfluence of hibernene, and kept cool by the chill of space, a man could\nspend the rest of his life there--unmoving, unknowing, uncaring, dead as\nfar as he and the rest of Mankind were concerned--his slight bodily\nneeds tended automatically by machine.\n\nIt was a punishment that satisfied both sides of the life-or-death\nargument.\n\nHouston shook off the bleak, black feeling of terrible chill that had\ncrept over him and pushed his way into the UN Police building.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thirteenth floor housed the Psychodeviant Division. As he stood in\nthe rising elevator, Houston wondered wryly if the number 13 was good\nluck or bad in this case.\n\nHe stepped out of the elevator and headed for the Division Chief's\noffice.\n\nDivision Chief Reinhardt was a heavy-set, balding man, built like a\nprofessional wrestler. His cold blue eyes gleamed from beneath shaggy,\noverhanging brows, and his face was almost expressionless except for a\nfaint scowl that crossed it from time to time. In spite of the fact that\na Canadian education had wiped out all but the barest trace of German\naccent, his Prussian training, of the old Junkers school, was still\nevident. He demanded--and got--precision and obedience from his\nsubordinates, although he had no use for the strictly military viewpoint\nof obsequiousness towards one's superiors.\n\nHe was sitting behind his desk, scowling slightly at some papers on it\nwhen Houston stepped in.\n\n\"You wanted me to report straight to you, Mr. Reinhardt?\"\n\nReinhardt looked up, his heavy face becoming expressionless. \"Ah,\nHouston. Yes; sit down. You did a fine job on that London affair; that's\nwhat I call coming through at the last moment.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Your orders to return,\" he said, \"were cut before you found your man.\nWe have a much more important case for you than some petty pilfering\nController. We are after much more dangerous game.\"\n\nHouston nodded. \"I see.\" Inwardly, he wondered. It was almost as if\nReinhardt knew that Houston had found out that the recall had come\nearly. Houston would have given his right arm at that moment to be able\nto probe Reinhardt's mind. But he held himself back. He had, in the\npast, sent tentative probes toward the Division Chief and found nothing,\nbut he didn't know whether it would be safe now or not. It would be\nbetter to wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReinhardt stood up, walked to the wall, and turned on a display screen.\nHe twisted a knob to a certain setting, and a map of Manhattan Island\nsprang onto the screen in glowing color.\n\n\"As you know,\" Reinhardt said pedantically, \"no Controller can do a\nperfect job of controlling a normal person. No matter how much he may\nwant to make John Smith act naturally, some of the personality of the\nController will show up in the actions of John Smith. Am I correct?\"\n\nHouston nodded without saying anything. The question was purely\nrhetorical, and the statement was perfectly correct.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" Reinhardt continued, \"by means of these\npeculiarities, our psychologists have found that there is widespread,\nbut very subtle controlling going on right in the UN General Assembly\nitself! The amazing thing is that they all bear the--shall we\nsay--trademark of the same Controller. Whoever he is, he seems to have a\nlong-range plan in mind; he wants to change, ever so slightly, certain\ninternational laws so that he will profit by them. Do you follow?\"\n\n\"I follow,\" said Houston.\n\n\"Good. It has taken painstaking research and a great deal of\npsychological statistical analysis, but we have found that one\ncompany--and one company only--benefits by these legal changes. Did you\never hear of Lasser & Sons?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Houston. \"They're in the import-export business, with a few\nfingers in shipping and air transport.\"\n\n\"That's them,\" said Reinhardt. \"Someone in that company, presumably\nsomeone at the top, is a Controller. And he's a very subtle, very\ndangerous man. Unlike the others, there is nothing hasty or overt in his\nplans. But within a few years, if this goes on, he will have more power\nthan the others ever dreamed of.\"\n\n\"And my job is to get him?\" Houston asked.\n\nReinhardt nodded. \"That's it. Get him. One way or another. You're in\ncharge; I don't care how you do it, but this one Controller is more\ndangerous than any other we've come across, so get him.\"\n\nHouston nodded slowly. \"Okay. Can you give me all the data you have so\nfar?\"\n\nReinhardt patted a heavy folder on his desk. \"It's all here.\" Then he\ntapped the projected map on the screen. \"That's the Lasser\nBuilding--Church Street at Worth. Somewhere in there is the man we're\nlooking for.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid Houston spent the next six weeks gathering facts, trying to\ndetermine the identity of the mysterious Controller at Lasser & Sons.\nSlowly, the evidence began to pile up.\n\nAt the same time, he worried over his own problem. Who was betraying\nnon-criminal Controllers to the PD Police?\n\nIn that six-week period, two more men and a woman were arrested--one in\nSpain, one in India, and one in Hawaii.\n\nThere weren't very many Controllers on Earth, percentagewise. Of the\nthree and a half billion people on Earth, less than an estimated\none-thousandth of one percent were telepathic. But that made a grand\ntotal of some thirty-five thousand people.\n\nSpread, as they were, all over the planet, it was rare that one\nController ever met another. The intelligent ones didn't use their\npower; they remained concealed, even from each other.\n\nBut _someone_, somewhere, was finding them and betraying them to the\nPsychodeviant Police.\n\nAs more and more data came in on the Lasser case, Houston began to get\nan idea. If there were a really clever, highly intelligent, megalomaniac\nController, wouldn't it be part of his psychological pattern to attempt\nto get rid of the majority of Controllers, those who simply wanted to\nlead normal lives?\n\nAnd, if so, wasn't it possible that both his cases--the official and the\nunofficial--might lead to the same place: Lasser & Sons?\n\nIt began to look as though Houston could kill both his birds at once, if\nhe could just figure out when, how, and in what direction to throw the\nstone.\n\nIn the middle of the seventh week, a Controller in Manchester, England,\nwas mobbed and torn to bits by an irate crowd before the PD Police\ncould get to him. There was no doubt in Houston's mind that this one was\na real megalomaniac; he had taken over another man's brain and forced\nhim to commit suicide. The controlled man had taken a Webley automatic,\nput it to his temple, and blown his brains out.\n\nThe Controller's mistake was in not realizing what the sudden shock of\nthat bullet, transmitted to him telepathically, could do to his own\nmind. In the mental disorder that followed, he was spotted and killed\neasily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was still no word from Dorrine. She had flown back to the States a\nweek after Houston had returned, but she had had to get back to England\nafter three days. Since then, he had had three letters, nothing more.\nAnd letters are a damned unsatisfactory way for a telepath to conduct a\nlove affair.\n\nThe one other factor that entered in was The Group, the small band of\nsane, reasonable telepaths who had begun to build themselves into an\norganization--a sort of Mutual Protective Association.\n\nPersonally, Houston didn't think much of the idea; the Group didn't have\nany real organization, and they refused to put one together. It was\nsupposed to be democratic, but it sometimes bordered on the anarchic.\n\nHe stayed with them more for companionship than any other reason. When\nDorrine had come back for her short stay, Houston had met with them and\ntried to get them to help him trace down the megalomaniac Controller who\nwas doing so much damage, but they'd balked at the idea. Their job, they\nclaimed, was to get enough members so that they could protect themselves\nfrom arrest by the Normals, and then just let things ride.\n\n\"After all,\" Dorrine had said, \"things will work themselves out,\ndarling; they always do.\"\n\n\"Not unless somebody helps them, they don't,\" Houston had snapped back.\n\"Someone has to do something.\"\n\n\"But, Dave, darling--we _are_ doing something! Don't you see?\"\n\nHe didn't, but there was no convincing either the Group or Dorrine. She\nwas passionately interested in the recruiting work she was doing, and\nshe thought that the Group was the answer to every Controller's\ntroubles.\n\nAnd then she had rushed back to England. \"I'll be back soon, Dave,\"\nshe'd said. \"I think I have a lead on a girl in Liverpool.\"\n\nSo far, the girl hadn't been found. Controllers didn't like to give\nthemselves away to anyone, so they kept a tight screen up most of the\ntime.\n\nIt seemed as though everyone on Earth was in deadly fear all the time.\nThe Normals feared losing their identities to Controllers, and the\nControllers feared death at the hands of the Normals.\n\nAnd death or the Penal Cluster were their only choices if they were\ndiscovered.\n\nHouston worried about the risks Dorrine was taking, but there was\nnothing he could do. She was doing what she thought was right, just as\nhe was; how could he argue with that?\n\nHouston went on with his job, putting together facts and rumors and\nstatistical data analysis, searching out his quarry.\n\nAnd, at the end of the eighth week, everything blew high, wide, and\nhellish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was late evening. A cool wind blew over New York, bringing with it a\nhint of the rain to come. Church Street, in lower Manhattan, was not\ncrowded, as it had been in the late afternoon, but neither was it\nentirely deserted. The cafes and bars did a lively business, but the\ntall, many-colored office buildings gaped at the street with blind and\ndarkened eyes. Only a few of the windows glowed whitely with fluorescent\nillumination.\n\nIn one of the small coffee shops, David Houston sat, smoking a cigarette\nand stirring idly at a cup of cooling coffee.\n\nAcross the street was the Lasser Building; high up on the sixtieth\nfloor, a whole suite of offices was brightly lit. The rest of the\nbuilding was clothed in blackness.\n\nWho was up there in that suite? Houston wasn't quite sure. He had\nnarrowed his list of suspects down to three men: John Sager, Loris\nPederson, and Norcross Lasser, three top officials in the company. Sager\nand Pederson were both vice-presidents of the firm; Sager was in charge\nof the Foreign Exports department, while Pederson handled the actual\nshipping. Lasser, by virtue of being the grandson of the man who had\nfounded the firm, was president of Lasser & Sons, Inc.\n\nLasser seemed like a poor choice as chief villain of the outfit; he was\na mild, bland man, quiet and friendly. Besides, his position made him\nan obvious suspect; naturally, the majority stockholder of the firm\nwould profit most by the increased power of the company. And, equally\nobviously, a Controller wouldn't want to put himself in such an exposed\nposition.\n\nWhich made Lasser, in Houston's mind, a hell of a good suspect. If\nanything happened, Lasser could cover by claiming that he, too, had been\ncontrolled, and the chances were that he could get away with it. A\nController never did anything directly; their dirty work was done by\nsomeone else--a puppet under their mental control. At least, so ran the\npopular misconception. If Lasser were the man, he stood a good chance of\ngetting away with it, even if he were caught, provided he played his\ncards right.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat reasoning still didn't eliminate Sager or Pederson. Either of them\ncould be the Controller. And there still remained the possibility that\nsome unknown, unsuspected fourth person had the company of Lasser & Sons\nunder his thumb.\n\nThat was what Houston intended to find out tonight.\n\nHe took a sip of his coffee, found it still reasonably hot.\n\nDamn the megalomaniacs, anyway! Houston subconsciously tightened his\nfists. He, personally, had more to fear from the Normals than from\nanother Controller. Normals could kill or imprison him, while a\nController would have a hard time doing either, directly.\n\nBut Houston could understand the Normal man; he could see how fear of a\nController could drive a man without the ability into a frenzied panic.\nHe could understand, even forgive their actions, born and bred in\nignorance and fear.\n\nNo, the ones he hated were the ones who had conceived and fostered that\nfear--the psychologically unstable megalomaniac Controllers. There were\nonly a handful of them--probably not more than a few hundred or a\nthousand. But because of them, every telepath on Earth found his life in\ndanger, and every Normal found his life a hell of terror.\n\nLet Dorrine and her do-nothing friends run around the globe recruiting\nmembers for their precious Group; that was all right for them.\nMeanwhile, David Houston would be doing something on a more basic action\nlevel.\n\nHe glanced at his watch. Almost time.\n\n\"How's the deployment?\" he whispered in his throat.\n\n\"We've got the building surrounded now,\" said the voice in his ear. \"You\ncan go in anytime.\"\n\n\"How about the roof?\"\n\n\"That's taken care of, sir; we've got 'copter that can be on the top of\nthe Lasser Building at any time you call. They can land within thirty\nseconds of your signal.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Houston said; \"I'm going in now. Remember--no matter what I say\nor do, no one is to leave that building if they're conscious. And keep\nyour eyes on me; if I act in the least peculiar, handcuff me--but don't\nknock me out.\n\n\"And if I'm not back on time, come in anyway.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston finished his coffee, dropped a coin on the counter, and headed\nfor the other side of the street.\n\nThe big problem was getting into the building itself. It was ringed with\nalarms; Lasser & Sons didn't want just anybody wandering in and out of\ntheir building.\n\nSo Houston had arranged a roundabout way. The building next to the\nLasser Building was a good deal smaller, only forty-five stories high. A\nweek before, Houston had rented an office on the eighteenth floor of\nthe building; on the door, he had already had a sign engraved: Ajax\nEnterprises.\n\nIt was a shame the office would never be used.\n\nHouston walked straight to the next-door building and opened the front\ndoor with his key. Inside, a night watchman lounged behind a desk,\nsmoking a blackened briar. He looked up, smiled, and nodded.\n\n\"Evening, Mr. Griswold; working late tonight?\"\n\nHouston forced a smile he did not feel. \"Just doing a little paper\nwork,\" he said.\n\nHe took the automatic elevator to the eighteenth floor. He didn't relish\nthe idea of walking up to the roof, but taking the elevator would make\nthe nightwatchman suspicious.\n\nHe didn't bother going to the office; he headed directly for the\nstairway and began his long climb--twenty-seven floors to the roof.\n\nAll through it, he kept up a running comment through his throat mike. \"I\nwish I weighed about fifty pounds less; carrying two hundred and twenty\npounds of blubber up these stairs isn't easy.\"\n\n\"Blubber, hooey!\" the earphone interrupted. \"Any man who's\nsix-feet-three has a right to carry that much weight. Actually, you're\na skinny-looking sort of goop.\"\n\nBoth men were exaggerating; Houston wasn't fat, but his broad, powerful\nframe couldn't be called skinny, either.\n\nWhen he finally reached the roof, he paused and surveyed the wall of the\nLasser Building, which towered high above him, spearing an additional\nthirty stories in the air. Up there, the lights on the sixtieth floor\ngleamed in the night.\n\nThe air was growing cooler, and the beginnings of a mist were forming.\nHouston hoped it wouldn't start to rain before he got inside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe forty-sixth floor of the Lasser Building had no windows on this\nside, but there were plenty on the forty-seventh.\n\nLeading up to them was an inviting looking fire escape, but Houston knew\nhe didn't dare take that. By law, every fire escape was rigged with a\nfire alarm, in addition to the regular burglar alarm. He'd have to use\nanother way.\n\nThe Lasser Building was a steel structure, shelled over with a bright\nblue anodized aluminum sheath. Only the day before, Houston, wearing the\ngray coverall of a power-line workman, had checked the wall to find the\nbig steel beams beneath the aluminum. He had also installed certain\nother equipment; now he was going to make use of it.\n\nConcealed in the louvres of the air-conditioner intake of the lower\nbuilding was a specially constructed suit and several hundred feet of\npower line which was connected to the main line of the building.\n\nIn the darkness, Houston slipped on the suit. It was constructed\nsomewhat like a light diving suit or a spacesuit, but without the\nhelmet. In the toes, knees, and hands, were powerful electromagnets\ncontrolled by switches in the fingers of the gloves and powered by the\ncurrent in the long line.\n\nHouston stepped over to the blue aluminum wall, reached out a hand, and\nlowered one finger. Instantly, the powerful magnet anchored his hand to\nthe wall, held by the dense magnetic field to the steel beam beneath the\naluminum sheath. That one magnet alone could support his full body\nweight, and he had six magnets to work with.\n\nSlowly, carefully, David Houston began to crawl up the wall.\n\nTurn on a magnet in the right hand; lift up the left hand and anchor it\nhigher; turn on the right hand and lift it even with the left, then\nanchor it again; do the same with both legs; then begin the process all\nover again, turning the magnets off and on in rotation.\n\nUp and up he went. Past the forty-sixth floor, past the forty-seventh,\nthe forty-eighth, and the forty-ninth. Not until he reached the fiftieth\nfloor did he attempt to open one of the windows.\n\nThere was a magnetic lock inside the window, but Houston had taken that,\ntoo, into account. The powerful magnet in his right glove slid it aside\neasily. Houston lifted the window and stepped inside.\n\nHe had ten more floors to go.\n\nHe took off the suit and rolled it up into a tight package, then dropped\nit out the window. It landed with a barely audible thump. Houston took a\ndeep breath, drew his stun gun, and headed for the stairway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the landing of the sixtieth floor of the Lasser Building, David\nHouston paused for a moment.\n\n\"Sounds like you're out of breath,\" said the voice in his ear.\n\n\"You try climbing all that way sometime,\" Houston whispered. \"I'm no\nsuperman, you know.\"\n\n\"Shucks,\" said the voice, \"you've disillusioned me. What now?\"\n\n\"I'm going to try to get a little information,\" Houston told him. \"Hold\non.\"\n\nOn the other side of the door, he could hear faint sound, as if someone\nwere moving around, but he could hear no voices.\n\nCarefully, he sent out a probing thought, trying to see if he could\nattune his mind with that of someone inside without betraying himself.\n\nHe couldn't detect anything. The sixtieth floor covered a lot of space;\nif whoever was inside was too far away, their thoughts would be too\nfaint to pick up unless Houston stepped up his own power, and he didn't\nwant to do that.\n\nCautiously, he reached out a hand and eased open the door.\n\nThe hallway was brightly lit, but there was no one in sight. The\nunaccustomed light made Houston blink for a moment before his eyes\nadjusted to it; the hallways and landings below had been pitch dark,\nforcing him to use a penlight to find his way up.\n\nHe stepped into the hallway, closing the door behind him.\n\nNow he could hear voices. He stopped to listen. The conversation was\ncoming from an office down the hall--if it could be called a\nconversation.\n\nThere would be long periods of silence, then a word or two: \"But not\nthat way.\" \"Until tomorrow.\" \"Vacillates.\"\n\nThere were three different voices.\n\nHouston moved on down the hall, his stun gun ready. A few yards from the\ndoor, he stopped again, and, very gently, he sent out another\nthought-probe, searching for the minds of those within, carefully\nforging his way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd, at that crucial instant, a voice spoke in his ear.\n\n\"Houston! What's going on? You haven't said a thing for two full\nminutes!\"\n\n\"I'm all right!\" Houston snapped. Only the force of long training and\nhabit kept him from shouting the words aloud instead of keeping them to\na subvocal whisper.\n\n\"All right or not,\" said the other, \"we're coming in in seven minutes,\nas ordered. Meanwhile, there's a news bulletin for you; the British\ndivision has picked up another Controller--a woman named Dorrine Kent.\nTwo in one night ought to be a pretty good bag.\"\n\nFor a moment, Houston's mind was a meaningless blur.\n\n_Dorrine!_\n\nAnd then another voice broke through his shock.\n\n\"Dear me, sir! Calm yourself! You're positively fizzing!\"\n\nHouston jerked. Standing in the doorway of the office was Norcross\nLasser, with a benign smile on his face and a deadly-looking .38\nautomatic in his hand. Behind him stood John Sager and Loris Pederson,\ntheir faces wary.\n\n\"Please drop that stun gun, Mr. Cop.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn those few moments, Houston had regained control of himself. He\nrealized what had happened. The interruption of his thought-probe had\nstartled him just a little, but that little had been enough to warn the\nController.\n\nHe wondered which of the three men was the actual Controller.\n\nHe began to lower his weapon, then, suddenly, with all the force and\nhatred he could muster, he sent a blistering, shocking thought toward\nthe man with the gun.\n\nLasser staggered as though he'd been struck. His gun wavered, and\nHouston fired quickly with his stun gun. At the same time, Lasser's\nautomatic went off.\n\nThe bullet went wild, and the stun beam didn't do much better. It struck\nLasser's hand, paralyzing it, but it didn't knock out Lasser.\n\nThe mental battle that ensued only took a half second, but at the speed\nof thought, a lot of things can happen in a half second.\n\nHouston realized almost instantaneously that he had made a vast mistake.\nHe had badly underestimated the enemy.\n\nThere was no need to worry, now, about which one of the men was a\nController--_all three of them were!_\n\nAs soon as Sager and Pederson realized what had happened, they\nleaped--mentally--into the battle. Lasser, already weakened by the\nunexpected mental blow from Houston, lost consciousness when the others\nlet loose their blasts because his mind was still linked with Houston's,\nand he absorbed a great deal of the mental energy meant for Houston's\nbrain.\n\nHouston, fully warned by now, held up a denial wall which screened his\nmind from the worst that Sager and Pederson could put out, but he knew\nhe couldn't hold out for long.\n\n\"Come in--_now!_\" he said hoarsely into the microphone.\n\n\"Stupid swine!\" Sager susurrated sibilantly.\n\nPederson said nothing aloud, but his brain was blazing with fear and\nhatred. His gun hand jerked towards a holster under his arm. Lasser was\nstill crumpling towards the floor.\n\nThe entire action had taken less than a second.\n\nHouston tried to fire again with his stun gun, but it required every bit\nof concentration he could sum up to hold off the combined mental\nassaults of Sager and Pederson.\n\nBut they, too, were at somewhat of a disadvantage. In order to keep all\ntheir efforts concentrated on the PD policeman, both Controllers had to\nrefrain from putting too much attention on their bodily motions.\nPederson was still fumbling for his gun, and Sager hadn't yet started\nfor his.\n\nLasser barely touched the floor before his consciousness began to\nreturn. The resulting fraction of a second of mental static afforded\nHouston a brief respite; it disturbed Pederson just as he was getting\nhis fingers on the butt of his weapon.\n\nBoth Controllers were focusing their mental energies on Houston's brain,\nand during the brief respite, Houston made one vital mental adjustment.\nHe allowed both thought-probes to fuse in a small part of his\nconsciousness. They went _through_ him and lashed back at the two\nControllers.\n\nBoth of them had had their minds tuned to Houston's, and in that instant\nthey found they, were also attuned to each other.\n\nThe resultant of the energy was shocking to Houston, but it was\ninfinitely worse for Sager and Pederson, since neither of them had been\nexpecting it. Pederson, who had already been slightly distracted, got\nthe major brunt of the force. He managed to jerk his gun free, but his\nbrain was already lapsing into unconsciousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston's fingers tightened on his own weapon. It fired once at Lasser,\nwho was trying to lift himself from the floor. Then it swept up and\ncoughed again, dropping Pederson. His pistol barked once, sending a\nsinging ricochet along the hall.\n\nSager, who had staggered to one side when he and Pederson had\nshort-circuited each other, had time to get behind the protection of\nthe office door. He couldn't close it because Lasser's and Pederson's\ninert forms blocked the doorway, but at least it afforded protection\nagainst Houston's stun gun.\n\nHis thought came through to Houston: _So the stupid Normals have a\nController working for them! Traitor!_\n\n_You're the traitor_, Houston thought coldly. _You and your megalomaniac\nfriends. It's madmen like you who have made telepaths hated and feared\nby the Normals._\n\n_And so they should hate and fear us_, came the snarling mental answer.\n_Within a few generations, we will have supplanted them. We will control\nEarth--not they._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe exchange had only taken a fraction of a second. Houston was already\ncharging toward the open door, hoping to get inside before Sager could\nreach a weapon.\n\n_You call me a traitor_, Houston thought, _but you have been framing\ninnocent Controllers, putting them into the hands of the PD Police_.\n\n_That's a lie!_ the reply came hotly. _We would never betray another\ntelepath to the stupid Normals! If a telepath were so bullheaded as to\nget in our way, we'd dispose of him. But it would be Controller\njustice; we wouldn't turn him over to animals!_\n\nIn one blazing moment, Houston realized that the Controller was telling\nthe truth!\n\nNo mental communication can be expressed properly in words. In, behind,\nand around each statement, other, dimmer nuances of thought gleam\nthrough. Each thought tells the receiver much more than can be put down\nin crude verbal symbols.\n\nThus, Houston already knew that Lasser, Sager, and Pederson were the\nthree top men in a world-wide clique of megalomaniac Controllers. This\nwas the top of the madmen's organization; these three were the _creme de\nla creme_ of the Normal human's real enemies.\n\nHe knew that there were twelve others scattered over Earth, and he knew\nwhere and who they were. That brief exchange had brought all the\ninformation into Houston's own mind as it leaked from the minds of the\nothers. He knew it without thinking about how he knew it.\n\nAnd they were _not_ the ones who had been turning the sane Controllers\nover to the Psychodeviant Police!\n\nThen who was? And why?\n\nHouston was right back where he had started.\n\nBut that brief instant of confusion was Houston's downfall. Sager\ninstantly realized that he had delivered, inadvertently, a telling blow\nto Houston's mind.\n\nPhysically, Houston had been propelling himself toward the open door. At\nthe instant of the revelation, he had been part way through it. And at\nthat moment, Sager acted.\n\nHe slammed all his weight violently against his side of the door,\nknocking Houston off balance as the door swung and struck him. He went\ndown, and Sager was on top of him before he struck the floor.\n\nIt was the weirdest battle ever fought, but its true worth could only\nhave been detected by another telepath. It was intense and brutal.\n\nThe men fought both physically and mentally. They struggled for\npossession of the stun gun, at the same time hurling emotion-charged\nshafts of mental energy at each other's brains.\n\nThe struggle lasted less than a minute. Somehow, Sager managed to get\none hand on the gun, twisting it. Houston, trying to keep it out of\nSager's hand, jerked it up between them.\n\nIt coughed once, sending a beam of supersonic energy into the bodies of\nboth men.\n\nThe effect was the same as if they had both been crowned with baseball\nbats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLittle pinpoints of light against a sea of darkness.\n\n_I'm cold_, Houston thought. _And I'm sick._\n\nHe couldn't tell whether his eyes were open or closed--and he didn't\nmuch care.\n\nHe tried to move his arms and legs, found he couldn't, and gave it up.\n\nHe blinked.\n\n_My eyes must be open_, he thought, _if I can blink_.\n\nWell, then, if his eyes were open, why couldn't he see anything? All he\ncould see were the little pinpoints of light against a background of\nutter blackness.\n\n_Like stars_, he thought.\n\n_Stars? STARS!_\n\nWith a sudden rush, total awareness came back to him, and he realized\nwith awful clarity where he was.\n\nHe was chained, spread-eagled, on an asteroid in the Penal Cluster,\nnearly a hundred million miles from Earth.\n\nIt was easy to piece together what had happened. He dimly remembered\nthat he had started to wake up once before. It was a vague, confused\nrecollection, but he knew what had taken place.\n\nThe PD Police, coming in response to his call, had found all four men\nunconscious from the effects of the stun beam. Naturally, all of them\nhad been taken into custody; the PD Police had to find out which one of\nthe men was the Controller and which the controlled. That could easily\nbe tested by waiting until they began to wake up; the resulting mental\ndisturbances would easily identify the telepath.\n\nHouston could imagine the consternation that must have resulted when the\nPD men found that all three suspects--_and_ their brother officer--were\nControllers.\n\nAnd now here he was--tried, convicted, and sentenced while he was\nunconscious--doomed to spend the rest of his life chained to a rock\nfloating in space.\n\nA sudden chill of terror came over him. Why wasn't he asleep? Why wasn't\nhe under hibernene?\n\n_It's their way of being funny_, came a bitter thought. _We're supposed\nto be under hibernene, but we're left to die, instead._\n\nFor a moment, Houston did not realize that the thought was not his own,\nso well did it reflect his own bitterness. It was bad enough to have to\nlive out one's life under the influence of the hibernation drug, but it\nwas infinitely worse to be conscious. Under hibernene, he would have\nknown nothing; his sleeping mind in his comatose body would never have\nrealized what had happened to him. But this way, he would remain fully\nawake while his body used up the air too fast and his stomach became\ntwisted with hunger pangs which no amount of intravenous feeding could\nquell. Oh, he'd live, all right--for a few months--but it would be\nabsolute hell while he lasted. Insanity and catatonia would come long\nbefore death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_That's a nasty thought; I wish you hadn't brought it up._\n\nThat wasn't his own thought! There was someone else out here!\n\n_Hell, yes, my friend; we're all out here._\n\n\"Where are you?\" Houston asked aloud, just to hear his own voice. He\nknew the other couldn't hear the words which echoed so hollowly inside\nthe bubble of the spacesuit helmet, but the thought behind them would\ncarry.\n\n\"You mean with relation to yourself?\" came the answer. \"I don't know. I\ncan see several rocks around me, but I can't tell which one you're on.\"\n\nHouston could tell now that the other person was talking aloud, too. So\ngreat was the illusion carried to his own brain that it almost seemed as\nthough he could hear the voice with his ears.\n\n\"Then there are others around us?\" Houston asked.\n\n\"Sure. There were three of us: a Hawaiian named Jerry Matsukuo; a girl\nfrom Bombay, Sonali Siddhartha; and myself, Juan Pedro de Cadiz. Jerry\nand Sonali are taking a little nap. You're the first of your group to\nwake up.\"\n\n\"My group?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my friend. There are five of you; the other four must still\nbe unconscious.\"\n\nFour? That would be Lasser, Sager, Pederson, and--_and Dorrine!_\n\nJuan Pedro de Cadiz picked up the whole thought-process easily.\n\n\"The girl--I'm sorry,\" he said. \"But the other three--of us all, I\nthink, they deserve this.\"\n\n\"Juan!\" came another thought-voice. \"Have our newcomers awakened?\"\n\n\"Just one of them, my sweet,\" replied the Spaniard. \"Sonali, may I\npresent Mr. David Houston. Mr. Houston, the lovely Sonali Siddhartha.\"\n\n\"Juano has a habit of jumping to conclusions, David,\" said the girl.\n\"He's never even seen me, and I'm sure that after three weeks of being\nlocked in this prison whatever beauty I may have had has disappeared.\"\n\n\"Your thoughts are beautiful, Sonali,\" said Juan Pedro, \"and with us,\nthat is all that counts.\"\n\n\"It is written,\" said a third voice, \"that he who disturbs the slumber\nof his betters will wake somebody up. You people are giving me dreams,\nwith your ceaseless mental chatter.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" the Spaniard said. \"Mr. Matsukuo, may I--\"\n\n\"I heard, Romeo, I heard,\" said the Hawaiian. \"An ex-cop, eh? I wonder\nif I like you? I'll take a few thousand years to think it over; in the\nmeantime, you may treat me as a friend.\"\n\n\"I'll try to live down my reputation,\" said Houston.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was an odd feeling. Physically, he was alone. Around him, he could\nsee nothing but the blackness of space and the glitter of the stars. He\nknew that the sun must be shining on the back of his own personal\nasteroid, but he couldn't see it. As far as his body was concerned,\nthere was nothing else in the universe but a chunk of pitted rock and a\nset of chains.\n\nBut mentally, he felt snug and warm, safe in the security of good\nfriends. He felt--\n\n\"David! David! Help me! Oh, David, David, David!\"\n\nIt was Dorrine, coming up from her slumber. Like a crashing blare of\nstatic across the neural band, her wakening mind burst into sudden\ntelepathic activity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGently, Houston sent out his thoughts, soothing her mind as he had\nsoothed Harris's mind weeks before. And he noticed, as he did it, that\nthe other three were with him, helping. By the time Dorrine was fully\nawake, she was no longer frightened or panicky.\n\n\"You're wonderful people,\" she thought simply, after several minutes.\n\n\"To one so beautiful, how else could we be?\" asked Juan Pedro.\n\n\"Ignore him, Dorrine,\" said Sonali, \"he tells me the same thing.\"\n\n\"But not in the same way, _amiga_!\" the Spaniard protested. \"Not in the\nsame way. The beauty of your mind, Sonali, is like the beauty of a\nmountain lake, cool and serene; the beauty of Dorrine is like the beauty\nof the sun--warm, fiery, and brilliant.\"\n\n\"By my beard!\" snorted Matsukuo. \"Such blather!\"\n\n\"I'll be willing to wager my beautiful _hacienda_ in the lovely\ncountryside of Aragon against your miserable palm-leaf _nipi_ shack on\nOahu that you have no beard,\" said Juan Pedro.\n\n\"Hah!\" said Matsukuo; \"that's all I need now--Castles in Spain.\"\n\nIt was suddenly dizzying for Houston. Here were five people, doomed to\nslow, painful death, talking as though there were nothing to worry\nabout. Within minutes, each had learned to know the others almost\nperfectly.\n\nIt was more than just the words each used. Talking aloud helped focus\nthe thoughts more, but at the same time, thousands of little, personal,\nfringe ideas were present with the main idea transmitted in words.\nHouston had talked telepathically to Dorrine hundreds of times, but\nnever before had so much fine detail come through.\n\nWhy? Was there something different about space that made mental\ncommunication so much more complete?\n\n\"No, not that, I think,\" said Matsukuo. \"I believe it is because we have\nlost our fear--not of death; we still fear death--but of betrayal.\"\n\nThat was it. They knew they were going to die, and soon. They had\nalready been sentenced; nothing further could frighten them. Always\nbefore, on Earth, they had kept their thoughts to themselves, fearing to\nbroadcast too much, lest the Normals find them out. The little, personal\nthings that made a human being a living personality were kept hidden\nbehind heavy mental walls. The suppression worked subconsciously, even\nwhen they actually wanted to communicate with another Controller.\n\nBut out here, there was nothing to fear on that score. Why should they,\nwho were already facing death, be afraid of anything now?\n\nSo they opened up--wide. And they knew each other as no group of human\nbeings had ever known each other. Every human being has little faults\nand foibles that he may be ashamed of, that he wants to keep hidden from\nothers. But such things no longer mattered out here, where they had\nnothing but imminent death and the emptiness of space--and each other.\n\nPhysically, they were miserable. To be chained in one position, with\nvery little room to move around, for three weeks, as Sonali had been,\nwas torture. Sonali had been there longer than the others--for three\ndays, there had been no one but herself out there in the loneliness of\nspace.\n\nBut now, even physical discomfort meant little; it was easy to forget\nthe body when the mind was free.\n\n\"What of the others?\" Dorrine asked. \"Where are the ones who were\nsentenced before us?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston thought of Robert Harris. What had happened to the young\nEnglishman?\n\n\"Space is big,\" said Juan Pedro. \"Perhaps they are too far away for our\nthoughts to reach them--or perhaps they are already dead.\"\n\n\"Let's not talk of death.\" Sonali Siddhartha's thought was soft. \"We\nhave so many things to do.\"\n\n\"We will have a language session,\" said Juan Pedro. \"_Si?_\"\n\nMatsukuo chuckled. \"Good! Houston, until you've tried to learn Spanish,\nHindustani, Arabic, Japanese, and French all at once, you don't know\nwhat a language session is. We--\"\n\nThe Hawaiian's thought was suddenly broken off by a shrieking burst of\nmental static.\n\nThe effect was similar to someone dropping a handful of broken glass\ninto an electric meat grinder right in the middle of a Bach cantata.\n\nIt was Sager, coming out of his coma.\n\nAlmost automatically, the five contacted his mind to relax him as he\nawoke. They touched his mind--and were repelled!\n\n_Stay out of my mind!_\n\nWith almost savage fury, the still half-conscious Sager hurled thoughts\nof hatred and fear at the five minds who had tried to help him. They\nrecoiled from the burst of insane emotion.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" Houston thought sharply. \"He's a tough fighter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first, Sager was terrified when he learned what had happened to him.\nThen the terror was mixed with a boiling, seething hatred. A hatred of\nthe Normals who had done this to him, and an even more terrible hatred\nfor Houston, the \"traitor.\"\n\nThe very emptiness of space itself seemed to vibrate with the surging\nviolence of his hatred.\n\n\"I know,\" Houston told him, \"you'd kill me if you could. But you can't,\nso forget it.\"\n\nNot even the power of that hatred could touch Houston, protected as he\nwas by the combined strength of the other four sane telepaths. He was\ncomparatively safe.\n\nSager snarled like a trapped animal. \"You're all insane! Look at you!\nThe four of you, siding with a man who has betrayed us to the Normals!\nHe--\"\n\nWhat Sager thought of Houston couldn't be put into words, and if it\ncould no sane person would want to repeat the mad foulness in those\nwords.\n\n\"This is unbearable!\" Sonali thought softly.\n\n\"That's not a mind,\" said Dorrine, \"it's a sewer.\"\n\n\"I suggest,\" said Matsukuo, \"that we do a little probing. Let's find out\nwhat makes this thing tick.\"\n\n\"Stay out of my mind!\" Sager screamed. \"You have no right!\"\n\n\"You seemed to think you had the right to probe into the helpless minds\nof Normals,\" said Juan Pedro coldly. \"We should show you how it feels.\"\n\n\"But they're just animals!\" Sager retorted. \"I am a Controller!\"\n\n\"You're a madman,\" said Matsukuo. \"And we must find out what makes you\nmad.\"\n\nSynchronizing perfectly, five minds began to probe at the walls that\nSager had built up around his personality. And as they probed, Sager\nretreated behind ever thicker walls, howling in hatred and anguish.\n\nOn and on went the five, needling, pressing at every weak spot, trying\nto break him down. Outnumbered and overpowered, it seemed as though\nSager had no chance.\n\nBut his insanity was stronger than they suspected. The barriers he built\nwere harder, more opaque, and more impenetrable than any they had ever\nseen. The five pushed on, anyway, but their advance slowed tremendously.\n\nThen, mentally, there was a sudden silence.\n\n_Sager?_ they thought.\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"That's finished it,\" said Houston. \"He's retreated so far behind those\nmental barriers that he's cut himself off completely.\"\n\n\"He's not dead, is he?\" Dorrine asked.\n\n\"Dead?\" said Juan Pedro. \"Not in the sense you mean. But I think he is\ncatatonic now; he has lost all touch with the outside. He is as though\nhe were still drugged; he is physically helpless, and mentally blanked\nout.\"\n\n\"There's one difference,\" Matsukuo said analytically. \"And that is that,\nalthough he has cut himself off from us and from the rest of the\nuniverse, he is still conscious in some little, walled-in compartment of\nhis mind. He has no one there but himself--and that, I think, is damned\npoor company.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey waited then. When Pederson awoke, they were ready for him. His\nhatred took a slightly different form from Sager's, but the effect was\nthe same.\n\nAnd so were the results when the five bore down on him.\n\nAgain they waited. Lasser was next.\n\nAt first, it looked as though Lasser would go the way of Sager and\nPederson, ending up as a hopelessly insane catatonic. Like his cohorts\nbefore him, Lasser retreated under the full pressure of the\nthought-probes of the five, building stronger and stronger walls.\n\nBut, quite suddenly, all his defenses crumbled. The mental barriers went\ndown, shattered and dissolving. Lasser's whole mind lay bare. Instead of\nfighting and hating, Lasser was begging, pleading for help.\n\nLasser was not basically insane. His mind was twisted and warped, but\nbeneath the outer shell was a personality that had enough internal\nstrength to be able to admit that it was wrong and ask for help instead\nof retreating into oblivion.\n\n\"This one--I think we can do something with,\" Matsukuo's thought\nwhispered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEight bodies, uncomfortable and pain-wracked, floated in space, chained\nto tiny asteroids that drifted slowly in their orbits under the constant\npull of the sun. Two of them contained minds that were locked\nirrevocably within prisons of their own building, sealed off forever\nfrom external stimuli, but their suffering was the greater for all that.\n\nThe other six, chained though their limbs might be, had minds that were\nfree--free, even, of any but the most necessary of internal limitations.\n\nEight bodies, chained to eight lumps of pitted rock, spun endlessly in\nendless space.\n\nAnd then the ship came.\n\nThe flare of its atomic rocket could be seen for over an hour before it\nreached the Penal Cluster. The six eyed it speculatively. Although only\ntwo of them were facing the proper direction to see it with their\nphysical eyes, the impressions of those two were easily transmitted to\nthe other four.\n\n\"Another load of captives,\" whispered Juan Pedro de Cadiz. \"How many\nthis time, I wonder?\"\n\n\"How long have we been here?\" asked Houston, not expecting any answer.\n\n\"Who knows?\" It was Lasser. \"What we need out here is a clock to tell us\nwhen we'll die.\"\n\n\"Our oxygen tanks are our clocks,\" said Sonali. \"And they'll notify us\nwhen the time comes.\"\n\n\"I do believe you morbid-minded people are developing a sense of humor,\"\nsaid Matsukuo, \"but I'm not sure I care for the style too much.\"\n\nThe flare of the rocket grew brighter as the decelerating ship\napproached the small cluster of rocks. At last the ship itself took\nform, shining in the eternal blaze of the sun. When the whiteness of the\nrocket blaze died suddenly, the ship was only a few dozen yards from\nHouston's own asteroid.\n\nAnd then a mental voice came into the minds of the six prisoners.\n\n\"How do you feel, Controllers?\"\n\nOnly Houston recognized that thought-pattern, but his recognition was\ntransmitted instantly to the others.\n\n\"_Reinhardt!_\"\n\nHermann Reinhardt, Division Chief of the Psychodeviant Police, the one\nman most hated and feared by Controllers, was himself a telepath!\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Reinhardt. \"Someone had to take control of the\nsituation. I was the only one who was in a position to do it.\"\n\nHis thoughts were neither hard nor cold; it was almost as if he were one\nof them--except for one thing. Only the words of his thoughts came\nthrough; there were none of the fringe thoughts that the six were used\nto in each other.\n\n\"That's true,\" thought Reinhardt. \"You see, we have been at this a good\ndeal longer than you.\" Then he directed his thoughts at members of the\ncrew of the spaceship, but they could still be heard by the six\nprisoners. \"All right, men, get those people off those rocks. We have to\nmake room for another batch.\"\n\nThe airlock in the side of the ship opened, and a dozen spacesuited men\nleaped out. The propulsion units in their hands guided them toward the\nprison asteroids.\n\n\"Give them all anaesthetic except Sager and Pederson,\" Reinhardt\nordered. \"They won't need it.\" Then, with a note of apology, \"I'm sorry\nwe'll have to anaesthetize you, but you've been in one position so long\nthat moving you will be rather painful. We have to get you to a hospital\nquickly.\"\n\nThe minds of the six prisoners were frantically pounding questions at\nthe PD chief, but he gave them no answer. \"No; wait until you're\nbetter.\"\n\nThe spacesuited rescuers went to the \"back\" of each asteroid and\ninjected sleep-gas into the oxygen line that ran from the tank to the\nspacesuit of the prisoner.\n\nHouston could smell the sweetish, pungent odor in his helmet. Just\nbefore he blacked out, he hurled one last accusing thought at Reinhardt.\n\n\"_You're_ the one who's been framing Controllers!\"\n\n\"Naturally, Houston,\" came the answer. \"How else could I get you out\nhere?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston woke up in a hospital bed. He was weak and hungry, but he felt\nno pain. As he came up from unconsciousness, he felt a fully awake mind\nguiding him out of the darkness.\n\nIt was Reinhardt.\n\n\"You're a tough man, Houston,\" he said mentally. \"The others won't wake\nup for a while yet.\"\n\nHe was sitting on a chair next to the bed, holding a smouldering\ncigarette in one hand. He looked strange, somehow, and it took Houston a\nmoment to realize that there was a smile on that broad, normally\nexpressionless face.\n\nHouston focussed his eyes on the man's face. \"I want an explanation,\nReinhardt,\" he said aloud. \"And it better be a damned good one.\"\n\n\"I give you free access to my mind,\" Reinhardt said. \"See for yourself\nif my method wasn't the best one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouston probed. The explanation, if not the best, was better than any\nHouston could have thought of.\n\nWhen the hatred of the normal-minded people of Earth had been turned\nagainst the Controllers because of the actions of a few megalomaniacs,\nit had become obvious that legal steps had to be taken to prevent mob\nviolence.\n\nIt had been Reinhardt himself who had suggested the Penal method to the\nUN government. At first, he had simply thought of it as a method to\nkeep the Controllers alive until he could think of something better. But\nwhen he had discovered, by accident, what a small group of Controllers,\nalone in space, could do, he had set up the present machinery.\n\nAs soon as a Controller was spotted, a careful frame-up was arranged.\nThen, when several had been found, they were arrested in quick\nsuccession and sent to the asteroids.\n\nAlways and invariably, they had done what Houston's group had done--the\nsane or potentially sane ones had improved themselves tremendously,\nwhile the megalomaniacs had lapsed into catatonia.\n\n\"Why couldn't it be done on Earth?\" Houston asked.\n\n\"We tried it,\" Reinhardt said. \"It didn't work. Safe, on Earth,\nsurrounded by Normals, a Controller still feels the hatred around him.\nHe can't open his mind completely. Only the certain knowledge of\nimpending death, and a complete freedom from the hatred of Normals can\nfree the mind.\n\n\"And that's why you couldn't be told beforehand; if you knew you were\ngoing to be rescued, you wouldn't open up.\"\n\nHouston nodded. It made sense. \"Where are we now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Antarctica,\" said Reinhardt. \"We've built an outpost here--almost\nself-sufficient. When you're in better shape physically, I'll show you\naround.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that everyone who's been arrested is here, in Antarctica?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReinhardt laughed. \"No, not by a long shot. Most of us are back out in\ncivilization, searching for new, undiscovered Controllers, so that we\ncan frame them. And, of course, some of us--the insane ones--have died.\nThey will themselves to die when the going gets too tough.\"\n\n\"Searching for recruits? Then the Group that Dorrine was working for\nwas--\"\n\nReinhardt shook his head. \"No. They were going about it the wrong way,\njust as you thought. We picked up the whole lot of them last week;\nthey're occupying the asteroids now.\"\n\n\"What do you do with the insane catatonics?\"\n\n\"Put them under hibernene and keep them alive. We hope, someday, to\nfigure out a method of restoring their sanity. Until then, let them\nsleep.\"\n\nHouston narrowed his eyes. \"How long have you known I was a Controller,\nReinhardt?\"\n\nThe Prussian smiled. \"Ever since you first tried to probe me.\nFortunately, my training enabled me to put up a shield that you couldn't\npenetrate; I seemed like a Normal to you.\n\n\"I kept you on because I knew you'd be useful in cracking Lasser and his\ngang when the time came. No one else could have done what you did that\nnight.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Houston said sincerely. \"What's going to happen now? After I\nget well, I mean.\"\n\n\"You'll do what the others have done. A little plastic surgery to change\nyour face a trifle, a little record-juggling to give you a new identity,\nand you'll be ready to go back to work for the PD Police.\n\n\"If anyone recognizes you, it's easy to take over their minds just long\nenough to make them forget. We allow that much Controlling.\"\n\n\"And then what?\" Houston wanted to know. \"What happens in the long run?\"\n\n\"In a way,\" said Reinhardt, \"your friend Sager was right. The\nControllers will eventually become the rulers of Earth. But not by force\nor trickery. We must just bide our time. More and more of us are being\nborn all the time; the Normals are becoming fewer and fewer. Within a\ncentury, we will outnumber them--we will be the Normals, not they.\n\n\"But they'll never know what's going on. The last Normal will die\nwithout ever knowing that he is in a world of telepaths.\n\n\"By the time that comes about, we'll no longer need the Penal Cluster,\nsince Controllers will be born into a world where there is no fear of\nnon-telepaths.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" Houston mused, \"I wonder how this ability came about. Why is\nthe human race acquiring telepathy so suddenly?\"\n\nReinhardt shrugged. \"I can give you many explanations--atomic radiation,\ncosmic rays, natural evolution. But none of them really explains it.\nThey just make it easier to live with.\n\n\"I think something similar must have happened a few hundred thousand\nyears ago, when Cro-Magnon man, our own ancestors, first developed true\nintelligence instead of the pseudo-intelligence, the highly developed\ninstincts, of the Neanderthals and other para-men.\n\n\"Within a relatively short time, the para-men had died out, leaving the\nCro-Magnon, with his true intelligence, to rule Earth.\"\n\nReinhardt stood up. \"Why is it happening? We don't know. Maybe we never\nwill know, any more than we know why Man developed intelligence.\" He\nshrugged. \"Perhaps the only explanation we'll ever have is to call it\nthe Will of God and let it go at that.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's the best explanation, after all,\" Houston said.\n\n\"Perhaps. Who knows?\" Reinhardt crushed his cigarette out in a tray.\n\"I'll go now, and let you get some rest. And don't worry; I'll have you\nnotified as soon as Dorrine starts to come out of it.\"\n\n\"Thanks--Chief,\" Houston said as Reinhardt left the room.\n\nDavid Houston lay back in his bed and closed his eyes.\n\nFor the first time in his life, he felt completely at peace--with\nhimself, and with the Universe.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ September 1957.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
