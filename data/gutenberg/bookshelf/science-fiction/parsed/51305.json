The golden\nMoon and the silver ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is the night when\nthis is to happen.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the man agreed severely, prying a little worriedly at Doc's\narthritic fingers that were clamped on his collar. \"No argument. Sure,\nup we go. But leave me go or, so help me, I'll fetch you one in the\nteeth!\"\n\nI came alongside and carefully started to lever the old man loose,\none finger at a time. It had to be done this way. I had learned that\nduring all these weeks and months. His hands looked old and crippled,\nbut I felt they were the strongest in the world. If a half dozen winos\nin Seattle hadn't helped me get them loose, Doc and I would have been\nwanted for the murder of a North American Mountie.\n\nIt was easier this night and that made me afraid. Doc's thin frame,\nlayered with lumpy fat, was beginning to muscle-dance against my side.\nOne of his times was coming on him. Then at last he was free of the\ngreasy collar of the human.\n\n\"I hope you'll forgive him, sir,\" I said, not meeting the man's eyes.\n\"He's my father and very old, as you can see.\" I laughed inside at the\nabsurd, easy lie. \"Old events seem recent to him.\"\n\nThe human nodded, Adam's apple jerking in the angry neon twilight.\n\"'Memory Jump,' you mean. All my great-grandfathers have it. But\nGreat-great-grandmother Lupos, funny thing, is like a schoolgirl.\nSharp, you know. I.... Say, the poor old guy looks sick. Want any help?\"\n\nI told the human no, thanks, and walked Doc toward the flophouse three\ndoors down. I hoped we would make it. I didn't know what would happen\nif we didn't. Doc was liable to say something that might nova Sol, for\nall I knew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMartians approaching the corner were sensing at Doc and me. They\nwere just cheap tourists slumming down on Skid Row. I hated tourists\nand especially I hated Martian tourists because I especially hated\nMartians. They were _aliens_. They weren't _men_ like Doc and me.\n\nThen I realized what was about to happen. It was foolish and awful and\ntrue. I was going to have one of mine at the same time Doc was having\nhis. That was bad. It had happened a few times right after I first\nfound him, but now it was worse. For some undefinable reason, I felt we\nkept getting closer each of the times.\n\nI tried not to think about it and helped Doc through the fly-specked\nflophouse doors.\n\nThe tubercular clerk looked up from the gaudy comics sections of one of\nthose little tabloids that have the funnies a week in advance.\n\n\"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he said mechanically.\n\n\"We'll use one bed,\" I told him. \"I'll give you twenty cents.\" I felt\nthe round hard quarter in my pocket, sweaty hand against sticky lining.\n\n\"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he played it back for me.\n\nDoc was quivering against me, his legs boneless.\n\n\"We can always make it over to the mission,\" I lied.\n\nThe clerk turned his upper lip as if he were going to spit. \"Awright,\nsince we ain't full up. In _ad_vance.\"\n\nI placed the quarter on the desk.\n\n\"Give me a nickel.\"\n\nThe clerk's hand fell on the coin and slid it off into the unknown\nbefore I could move, what with holding up Doc.\n\n\"You've got your nerve,\" he said at me with a fine mist of dew. \"Had a\nquarter all along and yet you Martian me down to twenty cents.\" He saw\nthe look on my face. \"I'll give you a _room_ for the two bits. That's\nbetter'n a bed for twenty.\"\n\nI knew I was going to need that nickel. _Desperately._ I reached across\nthe desk with my free hand and hauled the scrawny human up against the\nregister hard. I'm not as strong in my hands as Doc, but I managed.\n\n\"Give me a nickel,\" I said.\n\n\"What nickel?\" His eyes were big, but they kept looking right at me.\n\"You don't have any nickel. You don't have any quarter, not if I say\nso. Want I should call a cop and tell him you were flexing a muscle?\"\n\nI let go of him. He didn't scare me, but Doc was beginning to mumble\nand that _did_ scare me. I had to get him alone.\n\n\"Where's the room?\" I asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feet\nhigh. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a wino\nsinging on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn't\nhave any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone.\n\nI laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his face\nto shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all the\nbedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily.\n\nThen I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burning\neyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was so\ndirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggy\nscalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible's\ngas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never needed\nto shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that I\ndidn't need to.\n\nThe cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered,\nuncovered floor.\n\nIt stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at a\njagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving it\nan unreal distortion.\n\nDoc began to mumble louder.\n\nI knew I had to move.\n\nI waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, I\nmoved.\n\nI was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and found\nmy notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus both\nmy mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so I\nconcentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow their\nhabit pattern and construct the symbols for his words. They were\nsuddenly distinguishable.\n\n\"_Outsider_ ... _Thoth_ ... _Dyzan_ ... _Seven_ ... _Hsan_ ...\n_Beyond Six, Seven, Eight_ ... _Two boxes_ ... _Ralston_ ... _Richard\nWentworth_ ... _Jimmy Christopher_ ... _Kent Allard_ ... _Ayem_ ...\n_Oh, are_ ... _see_....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis voice rose to a meaningless wail that stretched into non-existence.\nThe pen slid across the scribbled face of the notebook and both dropped\nfrom my numb hands. But I knew. Somehow, inside me, _I knew_ that these\nwords were what I had been waiting for. They told everything I needed\nto know to become the most powerful man in the Solar Federation.\n\nThat wasn't just an addict's dream. I knew who Doc was. When I got\nto thinking it was just a dream and that I was dragging this old man\naround North America for nothing, I remembered who he was.\n\nI remembered that he was somebody very important whose name and work I\nhad once known, even if now I knew him only as Doc.\n\nPain was a pendulum within me, swinging from low throbbing bass to high\nscreaming tenor. I had to get out and get some. But I didn't have a\nnickel. Still, I had to get some.\n\nI crawled to the door and raised myself by the knob, slick with greasy\ndirt. The door opened and shut--there was no lock. I shouldn't leave\nDoc alone, but I had to.\n\nHe was starting to cry. He didn't always do that.\n\nI listened to him for a moment, then tested and tasted the craving that\ncrawled through my veins. I got back inside somehow.\n\nDoc was twisting on the cot, tears washing white streaks across his\nface. I shoved Doc's face up against my chest. I held onto him and let\nhim bellow. I soothed the lanks of soiled white hair back over his\nlumpy skull.\n\nHe shut up at last and I laid him down again and put his arm back\nacross his face. (You can't turn the light off and on in places like\nthat. The old wiring will blow the bulb half the time.)\n\nI don't remember how I got out onto the street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was pink and clean and her platinum hair was pulled straight back,\ndrawing her cheek-bones tighter, straightening her wide, appealing\nmouth, drawing her lean, athletic, feminine body erect. She was wearing\na powder-blue dress that covered all of her breasts and hips and the\nupper half of her legs.\n\nThe most wonderful thing about her was her perfume. Then I realized it\nwasn't perfume, only the scent of soap. Finally, I knew it wasn't that.\nIt was just healthy, fresh-scrubbed skin.\n\nI went to her at the bus stop, forcing my legs not to stagger. Nobody\nwould help a drunk. I don't know why, but nobody will help you if they\nthink you are blotto.\n\n\"Ma'am, could you help a man who's not had work?\" I kept my eyes down.\nI couldn't look a human in the eye and ask for help. \"Just a dime for a\ncup of coffee.\" I knew where I could get it for three cents, maybe two\nand a half.\n\nI felt her looking at me. She spoke in an educated voice, one she used,\nperhaps, as a teacher or supervising telephone operator. \"Do you want\nit for coffee, or to apply, or a glass or hypo of something else?\"\n\nI cringed and whined. She would expect it of me. I suddenly realized\nthat anybody as clean as she was had to be a tourist here. I hate\ntourists.\n\n\"Just coffee, ma'am.\" She was younger than I was, so I didn't have to\ncall her that. \"A little more for food, if you could spare it.\"\n\nI hadn't eaten in a day and a half, but I didn't care much.\n\n\"I'll buy you a dinner,\" she said carefully, \"provided I can go with\nyou and see for myself that you actually eat it.\"\n\nI felt my face flushing red. \"You wouldn't want to be seen with a bum\nlike me, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I'll be seen with you if you really want to eat.\"\n\nIt was certainly unfair and probably immoral. But I had no choice\nwhatever.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, tasting bitterness over the craving.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe coffee was in a thick white cup before me on the counter. It was\npale, grayish brown and steaming faintly. I picked it up in both hands\nto feel its warmth.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I could see the woman sitting on the stool\nbeside me. She had no right to intrude. This moment should be mine, but\nthere she sat, marring it for me, a contemptible _tourist_.\n\nI gulped down the thick, dark liquid brutally. It was all I could\ndo. The cramp flowed out of my diaphragm. I took another swallow and\nwas able to think straight again. A third swallow and I felt--good.\nNot abnormally stimulated, but strong, alert, poised on the brink of\nexhilaration.\n\nThat was what coffee did for me.\n\nI was a caffeine addict.\n\nEarth-norm humans sometimes have the addiction to a slight extent, but\nI knew that as a Centurian I had it infinitely worse. Caffeine affected\nmy metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the\nsame, but the _need_ ran as deep.\n\nI finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure\nsensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the\nprice of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles\nwith a few drops left in them. They have a little caffeine in\nthem--not enough, never enough, but better than nothing.\n\n\"Now what do you want to eat?\" the woman asked.\n\nI didn't look at her. She didn't know. She thought I was a human--an\n_Earth_ human. I was a _man_, of course, not an _alien_ like a Martian.\nEarthmen ran the whole Solar Federation, but I was just as good as an\nEarthman. With my suntan and short mane, I could pass, couldn't I? That\nproved it, didn't it?\n\n\"Hamburger,\" I said. \"Well done.\" I knew that would probably be all\nthey had fit to eat at a place like this. It might be horse meat, but\nthen I didn't have the local prejudices.\n\nI didn't look at the woman. I couldn't. But I kept remembering how\nclean she looked and I was aware of how clean she smelled. I was so\ndirty, so very dirty that I could never get clean if I bathed every\nhour for the rest of my life.\n\nThe hamburger was engulfed by five black-crowned, broken fingernails\nand raised to two rows of yellow ivory. I surrounded it like an ameba,\nalmost in a single movement of my jaws.\n\nSeveral other hamburgers followed the first. I lost count. I drank a\nglass of milk. I didn't want to black out on coffee with Doc waiting\nfor me.\n\n\"Could I have a few to take with me, miss?\" I pleaded.\n\nShe smiled. I caught that out of the edge of my vision, but mostly I\njust felt it.\n\n\"That's the first time you've called me anything but 'ma'am',\" she\nsaid. \"I'm not an old-maid schoolteacher, you know.\"\n\nThat probably meant she was a schoolteacher, though. \"No, miss,\" I said.\n\n\"It's Miss Casey--Vivian Casey,\" she corrected. She was a\nschoolteacher, all right. No other girl would introduce herself as Miss\nLast Name. Then there was something in her voice....\n\n\"What's your name?\" she said to me.\n\nI choked a little on a bite of stale bun.\n\nI _had_ a name, _of course_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and\nthought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the\ngirl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that\n_was_ my name.\n\n\"Kevin,\" I told her. \"John Kevin.\"\n\n\"Mister Kevin,\" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like\nwaterhose mist on a summer afternoon, \"I wonder if you could help _me_.\"\n\n\"Happy to, miss,\" I mumbled.\n\nShe pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.\n\"What do you think of this?\"\n\nI looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.\n\n    Dear Acolyte R. I. S.:\n\n    Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, \"The\n    Scarlet Book\" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the\n    Universe\n\n    Name: ........................\n\n    Address: .....................\n\nThe world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner\nand Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.\n\nThere was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was\ntrying to pull it out.\n\nI looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a\ncup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and\na pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five--if the\nlady didn't pay you.\"\n\n\"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that\nbill out of your hand?\"\n\nI didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman\nput down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant\nbar, smoothing it.\n\nI scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the\nsidewalk, only in the doorways.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFirst I opened the door on an amber world, then an azure one. Neon\nlight was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window\nsomewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and\nthe one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had\nchanged around--prayer came from the left, song from the right.\n\nDoc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a _thing_.\n\nMy heart hammered at my lungs. I _knew_ this last time had been\ndifferent. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time\nDoc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a\nstart.\n\nHe had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom.\nHis strong hands had unraveled some of the bed \"springs\"--metal\nwebbing--and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had\ndissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a\nmeaningful whole.\n\nI knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I\nbecame lost.\n\nI put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of\nhamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any\nhungry rats out of the walls.\n\nI knelt beside Doc.\n\n\"An order, my boy, an order,\" he whispered.\n\nI didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders?\n\nHe held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen,\nbefore dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook\nagainst the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it.\n\n\"Concentrate,\" Doc said hoarsely. \"Concentrate....\"\n\nI wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of\nconcentration.\n\nThe words \"First Edition\" were what I was thinking about most.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe heavy-set man in the ornate armchair was saying, \"The bullet struck\nme as I was pulling on my boot....\"\n\nI was kneeling on the floor of a Victorian living room. I'm quite\nfamiliar with Earth history and I recognized the period immediately.\n\nThen I realized what I had been trying to get from Doc all these\nmonths--time travel.\n\nA thin, sickly man was sprawled in the other chair in a rumpled\ndressing gown. My eyes held to his face, his pinpoint pupils and\nwhitened nose. He was a condemned snowbird! If there was anything I\nhated or held in more contempt than tourists or Martians, it was a\nsnowbird.\n\n\"My clients have occasioned singular methods of entry into these\nrooms,\" the thin man remarked, \"but never before have they used\ninstantaneous materialization.\"\n\nThe heavier man was half choking, half laughing. \"I say--I say, I would\nlike to see you explain this, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"I have no data,\" the thin man answered coolly. \"In such instance, one\nbegins to twist theories into fact, or facts into theories. I must ask\nthis unemployed, former professional man who has gone through a serious\nillness and is suffering a more serious addiction to tell me the place\nand _time_ from which he comes.\"\n\nThe surprise stung. \"How did you know?\" I asked.\n\nHe gestured with a pale hand. \"To maintain a logical approach, I must\nreject the supernatural. Your arrival, unless hallucinatory--and\ndespite my voluntary use of one drug and my involuntary experiences\nrecently with another, I must accept the evidence of my senses or\nretire from my profession--your arrival was then super-normal. I might\nsay super-scientific, of a science not of my or the good doctor's time,\nclearly. Time travel is a familiar folk legend and I have been reading\nan article by the entertaining Mr. Wells. Perhaps he will expand it\ninto one of his novels of scientific romance.\"\n\nI knew who these two men were, with a tormenting doubt. \"But the\nother--\"\n\n\"Your hands, though unclean, have never seen physical labor. Your\ncranial construction is of a superior type, or even if you reject my\ntheories, concentration does set the facial features. I judge you have\nsuffered an illness because of the inhibition of your beard growth.\nYour over-fondness for rum or opium, perhaps, is self-evident. You\nare at too resilient an age to be so sunk by even an amour. Why else\nthen would you let yourself fall into such an underfed and unsanitary\nstate?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was so smug and so sure, this snowbird. I hated him. Because I\ncouldn't trust to my own senses as he did.\n\n\"You don't exist,\" I said slowly, painfully. \"You are fictional\ncreations.\"\n\nThe doctor flushed darkly. \"You give my literary agent too much credit\nfor the addition of professional polish to my works.\"\n\nThe other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that\nlooked vaguely like an ice-skate. \"Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor\nwould tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory\nand practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better\nequipped to judge whether we exist.\"\n\nThere was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had\never heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception\nto Relativity and the positron and negatron.\n\n\"Interesting.\" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke.\n\"Presume that the people of your time by their 'Extra-sensory\nPerception' have altered the past to make it as they suppose it to be.\nThe great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we\nknow them. The great literary creations assume reality.\"\n\nI thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be\nthe goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed\nredhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the\ndetective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of\nunknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.\n\nHis bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal\nsymptoms.\"\n\nThe admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building\nup behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He\nwas not _really_ a snowbird.\n\nAfter a time, I asked the doctor a question.\n\n\"Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my\nprofessional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.\"\n\nAccepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great\nand good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened.\nMy heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote\nin sunlight and stepped toward it....\n\n... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe inclined the lethal silver toy. \"Let me see those papers, Kevin.\"\n\nI handed her the doctor's manuscript.\n\nHer breath escaped slowly and loudly. \"It's all right. It's all right.\nIt exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've read\nthis myself.\"\n\nDoc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.\n\n\"Don't move, Kevin,\" she said. \"I'll have to shoot you--maybe not to\nkill, but painfully.\"\n\nI watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But I\nhad known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but there\nwas something else.\n\n\"I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair,\" I\ntold her.\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know what you think it does to you.\"\n\nIt was getting hard for me to think. \"Who are you?\"\n\nShe showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable,\nNorth American Mounted Police.\n\nI had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc found\na method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical,\ntopographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept it\nsecret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist--he had\nhis crusades. How can you make money with time travel?\"\n\nI didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knew\nwas that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.\n\n\"It takes money--money Doc didn't have--to make money,\" Miss Casey\nsaid, \"even if you know what horse will come in and what stock will\nprosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of\nDoc's character. He was a scholar.\"\n\nWhy did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared\nme. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I\nneeded some coffee.\n\n\"He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines\nfor his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right--until\nhe started obtaining books that _did not exist_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI didn't know what all that was supposed to mean. I got to the chair,\nsnatched up the coffee container, tore it open and gulped down the\nsoothing liquid.\n\nI turned toward her and threw the rest of the coffee into her face.\n\nThe coffee splashed out over her platinum hair and powder-blue dress\nthat looked white when the neon was azure, purple when it was amber.\nThe coffee stained and soiled and ruined, and I was fiercely glad,\nunreasonably happy.\n\nI tore the gun away from her by the short barrel, not letting my filthy\nhands touch her scrubbed pink ones.\n\nI pointed the gun generally at her and backed around the _thing_ on the\nfloor to the cot. Doc had a pulse, but it was irregular. I checked for\na fever and there wasn't one. After that, I didn't know what to do.\n\nI looked up finally and saw a Martian in or about the doorway.\n\n\"Call me Andre,\" the Martian said. \"A common name but foreign. It\nshould serve as a point of reference.\"\n\nI had always wondered how a thing like a Martian could talk. Sometimes\nI wondered if they really could.\n\n\"You won't need the gun,\" Andre said conversationally.\n\n\"I'll keep it, thanks. What do _you_ want?\"\n\n\"I'll begin as Miss Casey did--by telling you things. Hundreds of\npeople disappeared from North America a few months ago.\"\n\n\"They always do,\" I told him.\n\n\"They ceased to exist--as human beings--shortly after they received a\nbook from Doc,\" the Martian said.\n\nSomething seemed to strike me in the back of the neck. I staggered, but\nmanaged to hold onto the gun and stand up.\n\n\"Use one of those sneaky Martian weapons again,\" I warned him,\n\"and I'll kill the girl.\" Martians were supposed to be against the\ndestruction of any life-form, I had read someplace. I doubted it, but\nit was worth a try.\n\n\"Kevin,\" Andre said, \"why don't you take a bath?\"\n\nThe Martian weapon staggered me again. I tried to say something. I\ntried to explain that I was so dirty that I could never get clean no\nmatter how often I bathed. No words formed.\n\n\"But, Kevin,\" Andre said, \"you aren't _that_ dirty.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe blow shook the gun from my fingers. It almost fell into the _thing_\non the floor, but at the last moment seemed to change direction and\nmiss it.\n\nI knew something. \"I don't wash because I drink coffee.\"\n\n\"It's all right to drink coffee, isn't it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, and added absurdly, \"That's why I don't wash.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Andre said slowly, ploddingly, \"that if you bathed, you\nwould be admitting that drinking coffee was in the same class as any\nother solitary vice that makes people wash frequently.\"\n\nI was knocked to my knees.\n\n\"Kevin,\" the Martian said, \"drinking coffee represents a major vice\nonly in Centurian humanoids, not Earth-norm human beings. _Which are\nyou?_\"\n\nNothing came out of my gabbling mouth.\n\n\"_What is Doc's full name?_\"\n\nI almost fell in, but at the last instant I caught myself and said,\n\"Doctor Kevin O'Malley, Senior.\"\n\nFrom the bed, Doc said a word. \"Son.\"\n\nThen he disappeared.\n\nI looked at that which he had made. I wondered where he had gone, in\nsearch of what.\n\n\"He didn't use that,\" Andre said.\n\nSo I was an Earthman, Doc's son. So my addiction to coffee was all in\nmy mind. That didn't change anything. They say sex is all in your mind.\nI didn't want to be cured. I wouldn't be. Doc was gone. That was all I\nhad now. That and the _thing_ he left.\n\n\"The rest is simple,\" Andre said. \"Doc O'Malley bought up all the stock\nin a certain ancient metaphysical order and started supplying members\nwith certain books. Can you imagine the effect of the _Book of Dyzan_\nor the _Book of Thoth_ or the _Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan_ or the\n_Necronomican_ itself on human beings?\"\n\n\"But they don't exist,\" I said wearily.\n\n\"Exactly, Kevin, exactly. They have never existed any more than your\nVictorian detective friend. But the unconscious racial mind has reached\nback into time and created them. And that unconscious mind, deeper than\npsychology terms the subconscious, has always known about the powers\nof ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, precognition. Through these books,\nthe human race can tell itself how to achieve a state of pure logic,\nwithout food, without sex, without conflict--just as Doc has achieved\nsuch a state--a little late, true. He had a powerful guilt complex,\neven stronger than your withdrawal, over releasing this blessing on\nthe inhabited universe, but reason finally prevailed. He had reached a\nstate of pure thought.\"\n\n\"The North American government _has_ to have this secret, Kevin,\" the\ngirl said. \"You can't let it fall into the hands of the Martians.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAndre did not deny that he wanted it to fall into his hands.\n\nI knew I could not let Doc's--Dad's--time travel _thing_ fall into\nanyone's hands. I remembered that all the copies of the books had\ndisappeared with their readers now. There must not be any more, I knew.\n\nMiss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I\ndon't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it.\n\nI kicked the _thing_ to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you\ncan't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums\nbefore Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time\ntravel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we\nweren't now.\n\nMiss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't\nmind her touching me.\n\n\"I'm glad,\" she said.\n\nAndre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?\n\nI would never know. I supposed I had destroyed _it_ because I didn't\nwant the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose,\ndirection or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could\nkick the habit--perhaps with Miss Casey's help--but I wasn't really\nconfident.\n\nMaybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without material\nneeds would not grow and roast coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Confidence Game, by Jim Harmon\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CONFIDENCE GAME ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51305.txt or 51305.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/3/0/51305/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
