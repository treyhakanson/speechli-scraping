The Mars of these two is an old\n    culture, old and finite._\n\n\n       i\n    like\n martian\n   music\n\n _by CHARLES E. FRITCH_\n\n\n Longtree played. His features relaxed into a gentle smile\n of happiness and his body turned a bright red orange.\n\n\nLongtree sat before his hole in the ground and gazed thoughtfully among\nthe sandy red hills that surrounded him. His skin at that moment was a\nmedium yellow, a shade between pride and happiness at having his brief\nsymphony almost completed, with just a faint tinge of red to denote that\nuncertain, cautious approach to the last note which had eluded him thus\nfar.\n\nHe sat there unmoving for a while, and then he picked up his blowstring\nand fitted the mouthpiece between his thin lips. He blew into it softly\nand at the same time gently strummed the three strings stretching the\nlength of the instrument. The note was a firm clear one which would have\nmade any other musician proud.\n\nBut Longtree frowned, and at the disappointment his body flushed a dark\ngreen and began taking on a purple cast of anger. Hastily, he put down\nthe blowstring and tried to think of something else. Slowly his normal\ncolor returned.\n\nAcross the nearest hill came his friend Channeljumper, striding on the\nlong thin ungainly legs that had given him his name. His skin radiated a\nblissful orange.\n\n\"Longtree!\" Channeljumper exclaimed enthusiastically, collapsing on the\nground nearby and folding his legs around him. \"How's the symphony\ncoming?\"\n\n\"Not so good,\" Longtree admitted sadly, and his skin turned green at the\nmemory. \"If I don't get that last note, I may be this color the rest of\nmy life.\"\n\n\"Why don't you play what you've written so far. It's not very long, and\nit might cheer you up a bit.\"\n\nYou're a good friend, Channeljumper, Longtree thought, and when Redsand\nand I are married after the Music Festival we'll have you over to our\nhole for dinner. As he thought this, he felt his body take on an orange\ncast, and he felt better.\n\n\"I can't seem to get that last note,\" he said, picking up the blowstring\nagain and putting it into position. \"The final note must be conclusive,\nsomething complete in itself and yet be able to sum up the entire\nmeaning of the symphony preceding it.\"\n\nChanneljumper hummed sympathetically. \"That's a big job for one note. It\nmight be a sound no one has ever heard before.\"\n\nLongtree shrugged. \"It may even sound _alien_,\" he admitted, \"but it's\ngot to be the right note.\"\n\n\"Play, and we'll see,\" Channeljumper urged.\n\nLongtree played. And as he played, his features relaxed into a gentle\nsmile of happiness and his body turned orange. Delicately, he strummed\nthe three strings of the blowstring with his long-nailed fingers, softly\nhe pursed his frail lips and blew expertly into the mouthpiece.\n\nFrom the instrument came sounds the like of which Channeljumper had\nnever before heard. The Martian sat and listened in evident rapture, his\nbody radiating a golden glow of ecstasy. He sat and dreamed, and as the\nmusic played, his spine tingled with growing excitement. The music\nswelled, surrounding him, permeating him, picking him up in a great hand\nand sweeping him into new and strange and beautiful worlds--worlds of\ntall metal structures, of vast stretches of greenness and of water and\nof trees and of small pale creatures that flew giant metal insects. He\ndreamed of these things which his planet Mars had not known for millions\nof years.\n\nAfter a while, the music stopped, but for a moment neither of them said\nanything.\n\nAt last Channeljumper sighed. \"It's beautiful,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Longtree admitted.\n\n\"But--\" Channeljumper seemed puzzled--\"but somehow it doesn't seem\ncomplete. Almost, but not quite. As though--as though--\"\n\nLongtree sighed. \"One more note would do it. One more note--no more, no\nless--at the end of the crescendo could tie the symphony together and\nend it. But which one? I've tried them all, and none of them fit!\"\n\nHis voice had risen higher in his excitement, and Channeljumper warned,\n\"Careful, you're beginning to turn purple.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Longtree said mournfully, and the purple tint changed to a\nmore acceptable green. \"But I've got to win first prize at the festival\ntomorrow; Redsand promised to marry me if I did.\"\n\n\"You can't lose,\" Channeljumper told him, and then remembered, \"if you\ncan get that last note.\"\n\n\"If,\" Longtree echoed despairingly, as though his friend had asked the\nimpossible. \"I wish I had your confidence, Chan; you're orange most of\nthe time, while I'm a spectrum.\"\n\n\"I haven't your artistic temperament,\" Channeljumper told him. \"Besides,\norange is such a homely color I feel ashamed to have it all the time.\"\n\nAs he said this, he turned green with shame, and Longtree laughed at the\nparadox.\n\nChanneljumper laughed too, glad that he had diverted his friend's\nattention from the elusive and perhaps non-existent note. \"Did you know\nthe space rocket is due pretty soon,\" he said, \"perhaps even in time for\nthe Music Festival?\"\n\n\"Space rocket?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot you were busy composing and didn't get to hear about it,\"\nChanneljumper said. \"Well, Bigwind, who has a telescope in his hole,\ntold me a rocket is coming through space toward us, possibly from the\nthird planet.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Longtree said, not particularly interested.\n\n\"I wonder if they'll look like us?\" Channeljumper wondered.\n\n\"If they're intelligent, of course they will,\" Longtree said certainly,\nnot caring. \"Their culture will probably be alien, though, and their\nmusic--\" He paused and turned a very deep yellow. \"Of course! They might\neven be able to furnish the note I need to complete my symphony!\"\n\nChanneljumper shook his head. \"You've got to compose it all yourself,\"\nhe reminded, \"or you don't qualify. And if you don't qualify, you can't\nwin, and if you don't win, you can't marry Redsand.\"\n\n\"But just one little note--\" Longtree said.\n\nChanneljumper shrugged helplessly and turned sympathetically green. \"I\ndon't make the rules,\" he said.\n\n\"No. Well,\" Longtree went on in sudden determination, \"I'll find that\nlast note if I have to stay permanently purple.\"\n\nChanneljumper shuddered jestingly at this but remained pleasantly\norange. \"And I'll leave you alone so you can get to work,\" he said,\nunfolding himself.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" Longtree said, but Channeljumper's long legs had already\ntaken him over to the nearest sand dune and out of sight.\n\nAlone, Longtree picked up the blowstring once more, placed it against\nhis stomach, and gave out with a clear, beautiful, experimental note\nwhich was again not the one he desired.\n\nHe still had not found it an hour later, when the Sound came. The Sound\nwas a low unpleasant rumble, a sound lower than any Longtree had ever\nheard, and he wondered what it was. Thinking of it, he remembered he had\nseen a large flash of fire in the sky a moment before the roar came. But\nsince this last was clearly not likely at all, he dismissed the whole\nthing as imagination and tried again to coax some new note from the\nblowstring.\n\nA half hour later, Channeljumper came bounding excitedly over a sand\ndune. \"They're here,\" he cried, screeching to a halt and emitting yellow\nflashes of color.\n\n\"Who's here?\" Longtree demanded, turning violet in annoyance at the\ninterruption.\n\n\"The visitors from space,\" Channeljumper explained. \"They landed near my\nhole. They're little creatures, only half as big as we are, but thicker\nand grey colored.\"\n\n\"Grey colored?\" Longtree repeated incredulously, trying to picture the\nimprobability.\n\n\"But only on the outside,\" Channeljumper went on. \"They have an outside\nshell that comes off, and inside they're sort of pink-orange.\"\n\n\"Ah-ha,\" Longtree said, as though he'd suspected it all the time.\n\"Evidently they wear grey suits of some kind, probably for protection.\"\n\n\"They took them off anyway,\" Channeljumper said, eager to impart his\nknowledge, \"and they were sort of pink-orange underneath. There are only\ntwo of them, and one has long hair.\"\n\n\"Strange,\" Longtree mused, thinking of their own hairless bodies.\n\"Wonder what they want.\"\n\nChanneljumper shrugged to indicate he didn't know. \"The short-haired one\nfollowed me,\" he said.\n\nLongtree felt the chill blue of fear creep along his spine, but\nimmediate anger at himself changed it conveniently to purple, and he was\ncertain Channeljumper hadn't noticed. When he had controlled himself, he\nsaid, \"Well, it doesn't matter. I've got to get on with my symphony.\nThat last note--\"\n\n\"He's here,\" Channeljumper announced.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nChanneljumper pointed eagerly, and Longtree's eyes followed the\ndirection to where the alien stood at the top of a nearby dune staring\nat them. Longtree could feel his skin automatically turning red with\ncaution, blending with the sand while the ever-trusting Channeljumper\nremained bright orange.\n\n\"Good gosh,\" the alien exclaimed. \"Not only do they look like modified\ngrasshoppers, they change color too!\"\n\n\"What'd he say?\" Longtree demanded.\n\n\"How should I know?\" Channeljumper said. \"It's in another language.\"\n\n\"And its voice,\" Longtree exclaimed, almost disbelieving it. \"Low. Lower\nthan even our drums' rumble.\"\n\n\"And they talk in squeaks yet!\" the alien told himself aloud.\n\nLongtree regarded the alien carefully. As Channeljumper had said, the\ncreature was short and had close-cropped hair on its head. The legs were\nbrief and pudgy, and Longtree felt a shade of pity for the creature who\ncould obviously not get around as well as they. It was undoubtedly\nintelligent--the space rocket testified to that--and the fact that the\ncreature's skin color stayed a peaceful pink-orange helped assure\nLongtree the alien's mission was friendly.\n\nThe alien raised a short arm and stepped slowly forward. \"I come in\npeace,\" he said in the language they could not understand. \"My wife and\nI are probably the only humans left alive. When we left Earth, most of\nthe population had been wiped out by atomics. I think we were the only\nones to get away.\"\n\nLongtree felt his redness subside to orange, as he wondered idly what\nthe alien had said. Except for a natural curiosity, he didn't really\ncare, for he remembered suddenly the symphony he had to finish by\ntomorrow if he were to marry Redsand. But there was the element of\npoliteness to consider, so he nudged Channeljumper.\n\n\"Don't just stand there, say something!\"\n\nChanneljumper flustered and turned several colors in rapid succession.\nHe stammered, \"Er--ah--welcome to our planet, O visitor from space,\" and\nmotioned the alien to sit down.\n\n\"That's not very creative,\" Longtree accused.\n\n\"What's the difference,\" Channeljumper pointed out, \"when he doesn't\nunderstand us anyway.\"\n\n\"You guys don't really look like grasshoppers,\" the man from Earth\napologized, coming forward; \"it's just the long legs that fooled me from\nup there. Boy, am I glad to find somebody intelligent on Mars; from the\nair we couldn't see any cities or anything, and we were afraid the\nplanet didn't have any life. I wish we could understand each other,\nthough.\"\n\nLongtree smiled pleasantly and wished the creature would go away so he\ncould search for the last note to his symphony. He picked up his\nblowstring so the alien wouldn't sit on it.\n\n\"Play for him,\" Channeljumper suggested, seating himself by segments.\n\"Just the last part to see how he reacts. Music is universal, you know.\"\n\nLongtree was going to do just that thing, for despite Channeljumper's\nwarning that he must compose every single note by himself, he felt an\nalien viewpoint might be helpful.\n\nHe started playing. Channeljumper sat dreaming, glowing radiantly, but\nthe alien seemed somewhat perturbed by the music and fidgeted nervously.\nCould it be, Longtree wondered, that the incredible beauty of his\ncomposition might not translate acceptably to alien ears? He dismissed\nthe thought as unlikely.\n\n\"Er--that's a bit high, isn't it?\" the creature said, shaking his head.\n\nLost in the sweeping melodies, neither Longtree nor Channeljumper paid\nany attention to the meaningless syllables. Longtree played on,\noblivious to all else, soaring toward the great screaming crescendo that\nwould culminate with the missing note.\n\nVaguely, he became aware that the creature had gotten up, and he turned\na small part of his attention to the action. Longtree smiled inwardly,\npleased, and turned yellow with pride to think even a man from another\nplanet should so appreciate his symphony that he got up and danced a\nstrange dance and even sang to the music.\n\nThe alien held onto his ears and leaped erratically, singing, \"No, no,\nstop it. It's too high. My head's bursting!\"\n\nChanneljumper too seemed pleased by this show of appreciation, though\nneither of them understood the words, and Longtree swept into the final\nnotes of the rising crescendo with a gusto he had not previously\ndisplayed. He stopped where he had always stopped--and the final note\ncame!\n\nIt startled the Martians. Then the realization swept over them in glad\ntides of color. The symphony was complete now, with that final alien\nsound. Longtree could win both the festival prize and Redsand with it.\nThe last note was a soft popping sound that had come from the creature\nfrom another planet. They looked to see him sagging to the ground, his\nhead soft and pulpy.\n\n\"My symphony's complete,\" Longtree exclaimed jubilantly, a brilliant\nyellow now.\n\nBut Channeljumper's yellow happiness was tinged with green. \"A pity,\" he\nsaid, \"the creature had to give its life in exchange for the note.\"\n\n\"I believe it really wanted to,\" Longtree said, turning solemn. \"Did you\nsee how it danced to the music, as though in the throes of ecstasy, and\nit didn't change color once! It must have died happy to know it gave\nitself to a good cause.\"\n\n\"You could probably get by with claiming to use the creature as an\nauxiliary instrument,\" mused Channeljumper, practical once more, \"and\neliminate any claim that he might have assisted you. But what about the\nFestival? This one looks as though he doesn't have another note in him.\"\n\n\"There's the other one,\" Longtree reminded, \"the one with long hair. We\ncan save that one until tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Channeljumper agreed, standing up. \"I'll go get it, and you\ncan keep it safe here in your hole until tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"You're a good friend, Channeljumper,\" Longtree began, but the other was\nalready bounding out of sight over a sand dune.\n\nBlissfully he raised the blowstring into position and played the opening\nnotes to his symphony. The alien lay unmoving with its head in a sticky\npuddle, but Longtree took no notice. He didn't even consider that after\nthe Festival he would never be able to play his symphony again in all\nits glorious completeness. His spinal column tingled pleasantly, and his\nskin turned the golden yellow of unbearable happiness.\n\nThe music was beautiful.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1957.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
