It was\ndiscovered by a farmer in his field near Brookline, Massachusetts, shortly\nafter daybreak on the morning of the 11th. Astronomically, the event was\nrecorded by the observatory at Harvard as the sudden appearance of what\napparently was a new star, increasing in the short space of a few hours\nfrom invisibility to a power beyond that of the first magnitude, and then\nas rapidly fading again to invisibility. This star was recorded by two of\nthe other great North American observatories, and by one in the Argentine\nRepublic. That it was comparatively small in mass and exceedingly close to\nthe earth, even when first discovered, was obvious. All observers agreed\nthat it was a heavenly body of an entirely new order.\n\nThe observatory at Harvard supplemented its account by recording the\nfalling, just before dawn of the 11th, of an extraordinarily brilliant\nmeteor that flamed with a curious red and green light as it entered the\nearth's atmosphere. This meteor did not burn itself out, but fell, still\nretaining its luminosity, from a point near the zenith, to the horizon.\n\nWhat the farmer saw was a huge fire burning near the center of his field.\nIt was circular in form and about thirty feet in diameter. He was\nastonished to see it there, but what surprised him more was its peculiar\naspect.\n\nIt was still the twilight of dawn when he reached the field. He beheld the\nfire first from a point several hundred yards away. As he explained it,\nthe light--for it was more aptly described as a light than a\nfire--extended in parallel rays from the ground directly upward into the\nsky. He could see no line of demarkation where it ended at the top. It\nseemed to extend into the sky an infinite distance. It was, in fact, as\nthough an enormous searchlight were buried in his field, casting its beam\nof light directly upward.\n\nBut more than all this, the farmer was struck by the extraordinary color\nof the light. At the base it was a deep, solid green. This green color\nextended upward for perhaps fifty feet, then it shaded into red. The\nfarmer noticed, too, that the fire did not leap and dance with flames, but\nseemed rather to glow--a steady light like the burning of colored powder.\nIn the morning half-light it threw a weird, unearthly reddish-green glow\nover the field.\n\nThe farmer approached to within twenty feet of the light. He looked to see\nwhat was burning, but could not determine, for the greenish base extended\ndirectly down into the ground. He noticed also that it gave out\nextraordinarily little heat. The morning was not exceptionally cold, yet\nhe stood within twenty feet of the fire without discomfort.\n\nI was on the staff of the Boston _Observer_ at this time. I reached\nBrookline about noon of the 11th of November, and went directly to the\nfield where the fire was burning. Nearly a thousand people were there,\nwatching.\n\nBy daylight the fire still held its green and red color, although its\nlight was much less intense. It held its characteristic shape. Though\nclearly definable, under the rays of the sun it became quite transparent.\nLooking through it, I could see plainly the crowd of people on the farther\nside of the field. The effect was similar to looking through a faintly\ntinted glass, except that now I noticed that the light had a sort of\ncrawling motion, like the particles of a heavy fog. The fire came from a\nhole in the ground; by daylight now the hole could be seen plainly.\n\nFor some moments I stood silent, awestruck by this extraordinary\nspectacle. Then a man standing beside me remarked that there was no smoke.\nI had not thought of that before, but it was true--indeed, the fire\nappeared phosphorescent.\n\n\"Let's get up closer,\" said the man beside me.\n\nTogether we walked to within ten feet of the outer edge of the fire. We\ncould feel its heat now, although it was not uncomfortable except when it\nbeat directly on our faces. Standing so close, we could see down into the\nhole from which the light emanated.\n\nLying at the bottom of the hole, perhaps ten feet below the surface, I saw\nthe jagged top of an enormous gray sphere, burned and pitted. This was the\nmeteor--nearly thirty feet in diameter--that in its fall had buried itself\ndeep in the loam of the field.\n\nAs we stood there looking down into the hole some one across from us\ntossed in a ball of paper. It seemed to hang poised a moment, then it\nshriveled up, turned black, and floated slowly down until it rested on top\nof the sphere.\n\nSome one else threw a block of wood about a foot long into the hole. I\ncould see it as it struck the top of the sphere. It lay there an instant;\nthen it, too, turned black and charred, but it did not burst into flame.\n\nThe man beside me plucked at my sleeve. \"Why don't it burn?\" he asked.\n\nI shook myself loose.\n\n\"How should I know?\" I answered impatiently.\n\nI found myself trembling all over with an unreasoning fear, for there was\nsomething uncanny about the whole affair. I went back to Brookline soon\nafter that to send in the story and do some telephoning. When I got back\nto the field I saw a man in front of me carrying a pail of water. I fell\ninto step beside him.\n\n\"What do you suppose it'll do?\" he asked as we walked along.\n\n\"God knows,\" I answered. \"Try it.\"\n\nBut when we got down into the field we found the police authorities in\ncharge. The crowd was held back now in a circle, a hundred yards away from\nthe light. After some argument we got past the officials, and, followed by\ntwo camera men and a motion-picture man who bobbed up from nowhere, walked\nout across the cleared space toward the light. We stopped about six or\neight feet from the edge of the hole; the heat was uncomfortably intense.\n\n\"I'll make a dash for it,\" said the man with the pail.\n\nHe ran forward a few steps, splashed the water into the light, and hastily\nretreated. As the water struck the edge of the light there came a roar\nlike steam escaping under tremendous pressure; a great cloud of vapor\nrolled back over us and dissolved. When the air cleared I saw that the\nlight, or the fire of this mysterious agency, was unchanged. The water\ndashed against it had had absolutely no effect.\n\nIt was just after this incident that the first real tragedy happened. One\nof the many quadruplanes that had been circling over the field during the\nafternoon passed directly over the light at an altitude of perhaps three\nthousand feet. We saw it sail away erratically, as though its pilot no\nlonger had it under control. Then it suddenly burst into flame and came\nquivering down in a long, lengthening spiral of smoke.\n\nThat night the second of the meteors landed on the earth. It fell near\nJuneau, Alaska, and was accompanied by the same phenomena as the one we\nwere watching. The reports showed it to be slightly smaller in size than\nthe Brookline meteor. It burned brightly during the day of November 12.\nOn the morning of the 13th wireless reports from Alaska stated that it had\nburned out during the previous night.\n\nMeanwhile the light at Brookline was under constant surveillance. It\nremained unchanged in all respects.\n\nThe next night it rained--a heavy, pelting downpour. For a mile or more\naround the field the hissing of steam could be heard as the rain struck\nthe light. The next morning was clear, and still we saw no change in the\nlight.\n\nThen, a week later, came the cold spell of 1940. Surpassing in severity\nthe winters of 1888 and 1918, it broke all existing records of the Weather\nBureau. The temperature during the night of November 20, at Brookline,\nfell to thirty degrees below zero. During this night the fire was seen to\ndwindle gradually in size, and by morning it was entirely extinguished.\n\nNo other meteors fell that winter; and, as their significance remained\nunexplained, public interest in them soon died out. The observatories at\nHarvard, Flagstaff, Cordoba, and the newer one on Table Mountain, near\nCape Town, all reported the appearance of several new stars, flaring into\nprominence for a few hours and visible just after sunset and before dawn,\non several nights during November. But these published statements were\ncasually received and aroused only slight general comment.\n\nThen, in February, 1941, came the publication of Professor Newland's\nfamous theory of the Mercutian Light--as the fire was afterward known.\nProfessor Newland was at this time the foremost astronomer in America, and\nhis extraordinary theory and the predictions he made, coming from so\nauthoritative a source, amazed and startled the world.\n\nHis paper, couched in the language of science, was rewritten to the public\nunderstanding and published in the newspapers of nearly every country. It\nwas an exhaustive scientific deduction, explaining in theory the origin of\nthe two meteors that had fallen to earth two months before.\n\nIn effect Professor Newland declared that the curious astronomical\nphenomena of the previous November--the new \"stars\" observed, the two\nmeteors that had fallen with their red and green light-fire--were all\nevidence of the existence of intelligent life on the planet Mercury.\n\nI give you here only the more important parts of the paper as it was\nrewritten for the public prints:\n\n    ... I am therefore strongly inclined to accept the theory advanced by\n    Schiaparelli in 1882, in which he concluded that Mercury rotates on\n    its axis once in eighty-eight days. Now, since the sidereal revolution\n    of Mercury, _i.e._, its complete revolution around the sun, occupies\n    only slightly under eighty-eight days, the planet always presents the\n    same face to the sun. On that side reigns perpetual day; on the\n    other--the side presented to the earth as Mercury passes us--perpetual\n    night.\n\n    The existence of an atmospheric envelope on Mercury, to temper the\n    extremes of heat and cold that would otherwise exist on its light and\n    dark hemispheres, seems fairly certain. If there were no atmosphere on\n    the planet, temperatures on that face toward the sun would be\n    extraordinarily high--many hundred degrees hotter than the boiling\n    point of water.\n\n    Quite the other extreme would be the conditions on the dark side, for\n    without the sheltering blanket of an atmosphere, this surface must be\n    exposed to the intense cold of interplanetary space.\n\n    I have reason to believe, however, particularly from my deductions\n    made in connection with the photographs taken during the transit of\n    Mercury over the face of the sun on November 11 last, that there does\n    exist an atmosphere on this planet--an atmosphere that appears to be\n    denser and more cloudy than our own. I am led to this conclusion by\n    other evidence that has long been fairly generally accepted as fact.\n    The terminating edge of the phases of Mercury is not sharp, but\n    diffuse and shaded--there is here an atmospheric penumbra. The\n    spectroscope also shows lines of absorption, which proves that Mercury\n    has a gaseous envelope thicker than ours.\n\n    This atmosphere, whatever may be its nature I do not assume, tempers\n    the heat and cold on Mercury to a degree comparable to the earth. But\n    I do believe that it makes the planet--on its dark face\n    particularly--capable of supporting intelligent life of some form.\n\n    Mercury was in transit over the face of the sun on November 11, of\n    last year, within a few hours of the time the first meteor fell to\n    earth. The planet was therefore at one of her closest points to the\n    earth, and--this is significant--was presenting her _dark face_ toward\n    us.\n\n    At this time several new \"stars\" were reported, flashing into\n    brilliancy and then fading again into obscurity. All were observed in\n    the vicinity of Mercury; none appeared elsewhere. I believe these\n    so-called \"stars\" to be some form of interplanetary vehicle--probably\n    navigated in space by beings from Mercury. And from them were launched\n    the two meteors that struck our planet. How many others were\n    dispatched that may have missed their mark we have no means of\n    determining.\n\n    The days around November 11 last, owing to the proximity of Mercury to\n    the earth, were most favorable for such a bombardment. A similar time\n    is now once more almost upon us!\n\n    Because of the difference in the velocities of Mercury and the earth\n    in their revolutions around the sun, one synodic revolution of\n    Mercury, _i.e._, from one inferior conjunction to the next, requires\n    nearly one hundred and sixteen days. In eighty-eight days Mercury has\n    completed her sidereal revolution, but during that time the earth has\n    moved ahead a distance requiring twenty-eight days more before she can\n    be overtaken.\n\n    After the first week in March of this year therefore Mercury will\n    again be approaching inferior conjunction, and again will pass at her\n    closest point to the earth.\n\n    We may expect at this time another bombardment of a severity that may\n    cause tremendous destruction, or destroy entirely life on this planet!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nTHE UNKNOWN ENEMY.\n\n\nWhen, in February, 1941, Professor James Newland issued this remarkable\nstatement, my paper sent me at once to interview him. He was at this time\nat the head of the Harvard observatory staff. He lived with his son and\ndaughter in Cambridge. His wife was dead. I had been acquainted with the\nprofessor and his family for some time. I first met his son, Alan, during\nour university days at Harvard. We liked each other at once, and became\nfirm friends--possibly because we were such opposite physical types, as\nsometimes happens.\n\nAlan was tall, lean and muscular--an inch or so over six feet--with the\nperfect build of an athlete. I am dark; Alan was blond, with short, curly\nhair, and blue eyes. His features were strong and regular. He was, in\nfact, one of the handsomest men I have ever seen. And yet he acted as\nthough he didn't know it--or if he did, as though he considered it a\nhandicap. I think what saved him was his ingenious, ready smile, and his\nretiring, unassuming--almost diffident--manner.\n\nAt the time of the events I am describing Alan was twenty-two--about two\nyears younger than I. It was his first year out of college. He had taken a\nscientific course and intended to join his father's staff.\n\nBeth and Alan were twins. I was tremendously interested in Beth even then.\nShe seemed one of the most worth-while girls I had ever met. She was a\nlittle wisp of femininity, slender and delicate, hardly more than five\nfeet one or two. She had beautiful golden hair and an animated, pretty\nface, with a pert little snub nose. She was a graduate of Vassar, and\nplanned to take up chemistry as a profession, for she had the same\nscientific bent as her father and brother.\n\nI called upon Professor Newland the evening of the day his statement was\npublished, and found all three discussing it.\n\n\"You want me to talk for publication, don't you, Bob Trevor?\" the\nprofessor asked suddenly, after we had exchanged a few pleasantries.\n\nHe was a wiry little man, about sixty, smooth-shaven, with sparse gray\nhair, a rugged face of strong character, and a restless air of energy\nabout him. He was an indefatigable worker; indeed, I am confident that,\nfor any single continuous period of work without sleep, he could have run\nAlan and me into the ground and still have been comparatively fresh.\n\n\"You want an exclusive follow-up story from me to-night, don't you?\" he\nrepeated.\n\nI admitted that I did.\n\n\"What you'll get won't be just what you expect. Look at this.\"\n\nHe pulled one of the evening papers toward him vigorously. \"They think it\nis humorous. There--read that.\"\n\nThe item to which he pointed was a sprightly account of the weird beings\nthat might shortly arrive from Mercury.\n\n\"They think it's a joke--some of them. There's another--read that.\"\n\nThe attitude of the press was distinctly an inclination to treat the\naffair from the humorous side. I had seen indications of that during the\nday at the office.\n\n\"Look here, Bob\"--the professor swept all the papers aside with his hand.\n\"You put it to them this way. Make them see this is not a prediction of\nthe end of the world. We've had those before--nobody pays any attention to\nthem, and rightly so. But this Mercutian Light is more than a theory--it's\na fact. We fought it last November, and we'll have to fight it again next\nmonth. That's what I want to make them realize.\"\n\n\"They'll think it is worth being serious about,\" Alan put in, \"if one of\nthose lights drop into Boston or New York--especially if it happens to\nplay in a horizontal direction instead of vertical.\"\n\nWe went into the whole subject thoroughly, and the professor gave me a\nsecond signed statement in which he called upon the nations of the world\nto prepare for the coming peril.\n\nThe actual characteristics of the Mercutian Light we had discussed before\nseveral times. A good deal had been printed about it during the previous\nDecember--without, as I have said, attracting much public attention. The\ntwo meteors had been examined. They were found to be of a mineral that\ncould have originated on Mercury. They were burned and pitted like other\nmeteorites by their passage through the earth's atmosphere.\n\nOf the light itself Professor Newland had already given his opinion. It\nwas, he said, some unknown form of etheric vibration. It radiated heat\nvery slightly, but it had the peculiarity of generating intense heat in\nanything it touched directly.\n\n\"You'd better explain that, father,\" said Beth, when we reached this point\nin our summary that evening.\n\n\"Heat is the vibration of molecules of matter,\" the professor began.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Make it clear when you write it up, Bob,\" Alan put in. \"It's like this.\nAll molecules are in motion--the faster the motion, the hotter the\nsubstance, and vice versa.\"\n\n\"And this Mercutian Light,\" Beth added, \"has the power of enormously\nincreasing the molecular vibration of anything it comes in contact with--\"\n\n\"But it doesn't radiate much heat itself,\" Alan finished.\n\nProfessor Newland smiled. \"The old man doesn't have much of a show, does\nhe?\"\n\nAlan sat down somewhat abashed, but Beth remained standing beside her\nfather, listening intently to everything he said.\n\n\"This light I conceive to be the chief weapon of warfare of the\nMercutians,\" the professor went on. \"There has been some talk of those two\nmeteors being signals. That's all nonsense. They were not signals--they\nwere missiles. It was an act of aggression.\"\n\nI tried to get him to give some idea of what the inhabitants of Mercury\nmight be like, for that was what my editor chiefly desired.\n\nAt first he would say nothing along those lines.\n\n\"That is pure speculation,\" he explained. \"And very easy speculation, too.\nAny one can allow his imagination to run wild and picture strange beings\nof another world. I don't predict they will actually land on the\nearth--and I have no idea what they will look like if they do land. As a\nmatter of fact, they will probably look very much like ourselves. I see no\nreason to doubt it.\"\n\n\"Like us?\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Alan. \"Conditions on Mercury are not fundamentally\ndifferent from here. We don't have to conceive any very extraordinary sort\nof being to fill them.\"\n\n\"Here's what you can tell your paper,\" said the professor abruptly. \"Take\nit down.\"\n\nI took out my notebook, and he dictated briskly.\n\n\"Regarding the possible characteristics of inhabitants of Mercury, it is\nmy conception that intelligent life--let us say, human life--wherever it\nexists in our universe does not greatly differ in character from that of\nour own planet. Mars, Venus, Mercury, even Neptune, are relatively close.\nI believe the Creator has constructed all human life on the same general\nplan.\n\n\"I believe that, being neighbors--if I may be permitted the expression--it\nis intended that intercourse between the planets should take place. That\nwe have been isolated up to the present time is only because of our\nignorance--our inability to bridge the gap. I believe that migration,\nfriendship, commerce, even war, between the inhabitants of different\nplanets of our solar system was intended by Almighty God--and, in good\ntime, will come to pass.\n\n\"This is not science; and yet science does not contradict it, in my\nopinion. Human life on Mercury, Venus or Mars may need bodies taller,\nshorter, heavier, lighter, more fragile or more solid than ours. The\norgans will differ from ours, perhaps, but not materially so. The senses\nwill be the same.\n\n\"In a word, I believe that nearly all the range of diversity of human life\nexisting on any of the planets exists now on this earth, or has existed in\nthe past, or will exist in the future through our own development, or at\nmost the differences would not be greater than a descent into our animal\nkingdom would give us.\n\n\"Mercutians may have the sense of smell developed to the point of a dog;\nthe instinct of direction of the homing pigeon; the eyes of a cat in the\ndark, or an owl in the light; but I cannot conceive of them being so\ndifferent that similar illustrations would not apply.\n\n\"I believe the Creator intends intercourse of some kind, friendly or\nunfriendly, to take place between the worlds. As China was for centuries,\nso for eons we of this earth have been isolated. That time is past. The\nfirst act was one of aggression. Let us wait for the next calmly but\nsoberly, with full realization of the danger. For we may be--indeed, I\nthink we are--approaching the time of greatest peril that human life on\nthis earth has ever had to face!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nTHE LANDING OF THE INVADERS.\n\n\nMarch 8, 1941, was the date at which Mercury was again to be in inferior\nconjunction--at her closest point to the earth since her transit over the\nface of the sun on November 11 of the previous year. During\nFebruary--after Professor Newland's statements--the subject received a\ntremendous amount of publicity. Some scientific men rallied to Professor\nNewland's support; others scouted the idea as absurd.\n\nOfficially, the governments of the world ignored the matter entirely. In\ngeneral, the press, editorially, wrote in a humorous vein, conjuring up\nmany ridiculous possibilities of what was about to happen. The public\nfollowed this lead. It was amused, interested to a degree; but, as a mass,\nneither apprehensive nor serious--only curious.\n\nIn some parts of the earth--among the smaller Latin nations\nparticularly--some apprehension was felt. But even so, no one knew what to\ndo about it--where to go to avoid the danger--for the attack, if it came\nat all, was as likely to strike one country as another.\n\nThe first week in March arrived with public interest steadily increasing.\nMercury, always difficult of observation, presented no spectacle for the\npublic gaze and imagination to feed upon. But, all over the world, there\nwere probably more eyes turned toward the setting and rising sun during\nthat week than ever had been turned there before.\n\nProfessor Newland issued no more statements after that evening I have\ndescribed. He was taken with a severe cold in the latter part of February,\nand as Beth was in delicate health and did not stand the Northern winters\nwell, the whole family left for a few months' stay at their bungalow home\nin Florida. They were quite close to the little village of Bay Head, on\nthe Gulf coast. I kept in communication with them there.\n\nThe 8th of March came and passed without a report from any part of the\nearth of the falling of the Mercutian meteors. Satirical comment in the\npress doubled. There was, indeed, no scientific report of any unusual\nastronomical phenomena, except from the Harvard observatory the following\nmorning. There Professor Newland's assistant, Professor Brighton, stated\nhe had again observed a new \"star\"--an interplanetary vehicle, as\nProfessor Newland described it. Only a single one had been observed this\ntime. It was seen just before dawn of the 9th.\n\nThen, about 4 P.M., Atlantic time, on the afternoon of the 9th, the world\nwas electrified by the report of the landing of invaders in the United\nStates. The news came by wireless from Billings, Montana. An\ninterplanetary vehicle of huge size had landed on the desert in the\nShoshone River district of northern Wyoming, west of the Big Horn\nMountains.\n\nThis strange visitor--it was described as a gleaming, silvery object\nperhaps a hundred feet in diameter--had landed near the little Mormon\nsettlement of Byron. The hope that its mission might be friendly was\ndispelled even in the first report from Billings. The characteristic red\nand green light-fire had swept the country near by--a horizontal beam this\ntime--and the town of Byron was reported destroyed, and in all likelihood\nwith the loss of its entire population.\n\nThe Boston _Observer_ sent me to Billings almost immediately by\nquadruplane. I arrived there about eight o'clock on the evening of the\n10th. The city was in a turmoil. Ranchers from the neighboring cattle\ncountry thronged its streets. A perfect exodus of people--Mormons and oil\nmen from Shoshone country, almost the entire populations of Cody, Powell,\nGarland, and other towns near the threatened section, the Indians from the\nCrow Reservation at Frannie--all were streaming through Billings.\n\nThe Wyoming State Airplane Patrol, gathered in a squadron by orders from\nCheyenne, occasionally passed overhead, flashing huge white searchlights.\nI went immediately to the office of the Billings _Dispatch_. It was so\ncrowded I could not get in. From what I could pick up among the excited,\nfrightened people of Billings, and the various bulletins that the\n_Dispatch_ had sent out during the day, the developments of the first\ntwenty-four hours of Mercutian invasion were these:\n\nOnly a single \"vehicle\"--we called it that for want of a better name--had\nlanded. Airplane observation placed its exact position on the west bank of\nthe Shoshone River, about four miles southwest of Byron and the same\ndistance southeast of Garland. The country here is typically that of the\nWyoming desert--sand and sagebrush--slightly rolling in some places, with\noccasional hills and buttes.\n\nThe Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad runs down its spur from the\nNorthern Pacific near Billings, passes through the towns of Frannie--near\nthe border of Montana and Wyoming--and Garland, and terminates at Cody.\nThis line, running special trains throughout the day, had brought up a\nlarge number of people. During the afternoon a bomb of some kind--it was\nvaguely described as a variation of the red and green light-rays--had\ndestroyed one of the trains near Garland. The road was now open only down\nto Frannie.\n\nThe town of Byron, I learned, was completely annihilated. It had been\nswept by the Mercutian Light and destroyed by fire. Garland was as yet\nunharmed. There was broken country between it and the Mercutian invaders,\nand the rays of the single light which they were using could not reach it\ndirectly.\n\nSuch, briefly, was the situation as I found it that evening of the 10th.\nIn Billings we were sixty-five miles north of the Mercutian landing place.\nWhat power for attack and destruction the enemy had, we had no means of\ndetermining. How many of them there were; how they could travel over the\ncountry; what the effective radius of their light-fire was; the nature of\nthe \"bomb\" that had destroyed the train on the C., B. and Q. near the town\nof Garland--all those were questions that no one could answer.\n\nBillings was, during those next few days, principally a gathering place\nand point of departure for refugees. Yet, so curiously is the human mind\nconstituted, underneath all this turmoil the affairs of Billings went on\nas before. The stores did not close; the Billings _Dispatch_ sent out its\nreports; the Northern Pacific trains from east and west daily brought\ntheir quota of reporters, picture men and curiosity seekers, and took away\nall who had sense enough to go. The C., B. and Q. continued running trains\nto Frannie--which was about fifteen miles from the Mercutian landing\nplace--and many of the newspaper men, most of those, in fact, who did not\nhave airplanes, went there.\n\nThat first evening in Billings, Rolland Mercer--a chap about my own age,\nwho had brought me from the East in one of the Boston _Observer's_\nplanes--and I, decided on a short flight about the neighboring country to\nlook the situation over. We started about midnight, a crisp, cloudless\nnight with no moon. We had been warned against venturing into the danger\nzone; several of the Wyoming patrol and numbers of private planes had been\nseen to fall in flames when the light struck them.\n\nWe had no idea what the danger zone was--how close we dared go--but\ndecided to chance it. To fly sufficiently high for safety directly over\nthe Mercutians appeared difficult, since the light-fire already had proven\neffective at a distance of several miles at least. We decided not to\nattempt that, but merely to follow the course of the C., B. and Q.\nsouthwest to Cody, then to circle around to the east, and thence back\nnorth to Billings, passing well to the east of the Mercutians.\n\nWe started, as I have said, about midnight, rising from the rolling\nprairie back of Billings. We climbed five hundred feet and, with our\nsearchlight playing upon the ground beneath, started directly for Frannie.\nWe passed over Frannie at about eight hundred feet, and continued on the\nC., B. and Q. line toward Garland. We had decided to pass to a\nconsiderable extent to the west of Garland, to be farther away from the\ndanger, and then to strike down to Cody.\n\nWe were flying now at a speed close to a hundred and forty miles an hour.\nOff to the left I could see the red and green beam of the single light of\nthe Mercutians; it was pointing vertically up into the air, motionless.\nSomething--I do not know what--made me decide to turn off our searchlight.\n\nI looked behind us. Some miles away, and considerably nearer the\nMercutians than we were, I saw the light of another plane. I was watching\nit when suddenly the red and green beam swung toward it, and a moment\nlater picked it up. I caught a fleeting glimpse of what I took to be a\nlittle biplane. It remained for an instant illuminated by the weird red\nand green flare; then the Mercutian Light swung back to its vertical\nposition. A second later the biplane burst into flames and fell.\n\nThe thing left me shuddering. I turned our searchlight permanently off and\nsat staring down at the shadowy country scurrying away beneath us.\n\nMercer had evidently not seen this tragedy. He did not look at me, but\nkept facing the front. We were now somewhat to the west of Garland, with\nit between us and the Mercutians. The few lights of the town could be seen\nplainly. The country beneath us seemed fairly level. To the west, half a\nmile away, perhaps, I could make out a sheer, perpendicular wall of rock.\nWe seemed to be flying parallel with it and about level with its top.\n\nWe were rising a little, I think, when suddenly our engines stopped. I\nremember it flashed through my mind to wonder how Mercer would dare shut\nthem off when we were flying so low. The sudden silence confused me a\nlittle. I started to ask him if he had seen the biplane fall, when he\nswung back abruptly and gripped me by the arm.\n\n\"Turn on the light--you fool--we've got to land!\"\n\nI fumbled with the searchlight. Then, just as I turned the switch, I saw,\nrising from a point near the base of the Mercutian Light, what appeared to\nbe a skyrocket.\n\nIt rose in a long, graceful arc, reached the top of its ascent, and came\ndown, still flaming. I remember deciding it would fall in or near Garland.\n\nIt seemed to go out just before it landed--at least I did not follow it\nall the way down. Then there came a flash as though a huge quantity of red\nand green smokeless powder had gone off in a puff; a brief instant of\ndarkness, and then flames rose from a hundred points in the little town.\nThe next second our wheels ground in the sand.\n\nI heard a splintering crash; something struck me violently on the\nshoulder; then--blackness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nTHE MEETING.\n\n\nProfessor Newland and his family were living in seclusion in their Florida\nhome at the time the Mercutian invaders landed in Wyoming. The curious\nevents in Florida, which connected them so directly with the invasion and\ncaused Alan later to play so vital a part in it, are so important that I\nam impelled to relate them chronologically, rather than as they were told\nme afterward by Alan and Beth.\n\nWhen, on March 9, the news that the Mercutians had landed in Wyoming\nreached Professor Newland, he immediately established telegraphic\ncommunication with Harvard. Thus he was kept fully informed on the\nsituation--indeed, he saw it as a whole far better than I did.\n\nOn March 12, three days after the landing, orders from Washington were\ngiven out, regulating all passenger transportation in the direction of the\ndanger zone. One hundred miles was the limit set. State troops were placed\non all trains, State roads were likewise guarded, and the State airplane\npatrols united in a vigilant effort to keep outside planes from getting\nin. On the 13th the President of the United States issued an appeal to all\npersons living within the hundred-mile limit, asking them to leave.\n\nOn March 14 the Canadian government offered its assistance in any way\npossible--its Saskatchewan airplane patrol was already helping Montana\nmaintain the hundred-mile limit. Similar offers were immediately made by\nnearly every government in the world.\n\nSuch were the first main steps taken to safeguard the people.\n\nBy March 14 the actual conditions of affairs in the threatened section of\nWyoming was fairly well known. The town of Garland was destroyed by fire\non the night of the 10th, and the towns of Mantua and Powell--north and\nsouth of Garland respectively--the following morning. On the evening of\nthe 11th a government plane, flying without lights, sacrificed itself in\nan attempt to drop a bomb into the Mercutian camp. It was caught by the\nlight when almost directly over the Mercutians, and was seen to fall in\nflames.\n\nIt was estimated that the single light was controlling an area with a\nradius of about ten miles. To the south and west there was practically\nnothing but desert. To the west Garland, Mantua and Powell were burned. To\nthe north Deaver and Crowley--on another branch of the C., B. and Q.,\nabout ten miles from the Mercutians--were as yet unharmed. They were,\nhowever, entirely deserted by the 15th.\n\nDuring these days the Mercutians did not move from their first landing\nplace. Newspaper speculation regarding their capabilities for offensive\naction ran rife. Perhaps they could not move. They appeared to possess but\none ray of light-fire; this had an effective radius of ten miles. The only\nother offensive weapon shown was the rocket, or bomb, that had destroyed\nthe C., B. and Q. train near Garland and the town itself. Reports differed\nas to what had set fire to the town of Powell.\n\nAll these points were less than ten miles away from the Mercutian base.\nObviously, then, the danger was grossly exaggerated. The unknown invaders\ncould safely and easily be shelled by artillery from a much greater\ndistance. Mercury had passed inferior conjunction; no other Mercutian\nvehicles had been reported as landing anywhere on the earth. A few days,\nand the danger would be over. Thus the newspapers of the country settled\nthe affair.\n\nOn March 14th it was announced that General Price would conduct the\nmilitary operations against the Mercutians. Press dispatches\nsimultaneously announced that troops, machine guns and artillery were\nbeing rushed to Billings. This provoked a caustic comment from the\nPreparedness League of America, to the effect that no military operations\nof any offensive value could be conducted by the United States against\nanybody or anything.\n\nThis statement was to some extent true. During the twenty years that had\nelapsed since the World War armament of all kinds had fallen into disuse.\nFew improvements in offensive weapons had been made. The military\norganization and equipment of the United States, and, indeed, that of many\nof the other great powers, was admittedly inadequate to cope with any very\npowerful enemy.\n\nProfessor Newland telegraphed to the War Department at Washington on the\n14th, stating that in his opinion new scientific measures would have to be\ndevised to deal with this enemy, and that whatever scientific knowledge he\nhad on the subject was at their disposal at their request. To this\ntelegram the government never replied.\n\nIt was a day or two after that--on the morning of the 16th, to be\nexact--that the next most important development in this strange affair\ntook place. Alan Newland rose that morning at dawn and took his launch for\na trip up one of the neighboring bayous. He was alone, and intended to\nfish for an hour or so and return home in time for breakfast.\n\nHe went, perhaps, three miles up the winding little stream. Then, just\nafter sunrise, he shut off the motor and drifted silently along. The bayou\nsplit into two streams here, coming together again a quarter of a mile\nfarther on, and thus forming a little island. It was just past the point\nof this island that Alan shut off his motor.\n\nHe had been sitting quiet several minutes preparing his tackle, when his\neye caught something moving behind the dark green of the magnolia trees\nhanging over the low banks of the island. It seemed to be a flicker of red\nand white some five feet above the ground. Instinctively he reached for\nthe little rifle he had brought with him to shoot at it, thinking it might\nbe a bird, although he had never seen one before of such a color.\n\nA moment later, in the silence, he heard a rustling of the palmettos near\nthe bank of the bayou. He waited, quiet, with the rifle across his knees.\nHis launch was still moving forward slowly from the impetus of the motor.\nAnd then, quite suddenly, he came into sight of the figure of a girl\nstanding motionless beside a tree on the island a few feet back from the\nwater and evidently watching him.\n\nAlan was startled. He knew there was no one living on the island. There\nwere, in fact, few people at all in the vicinity--only an occasional negro\nshack or the similar shack of the \"poor white trash,\" and a turpentine\ncamp, several miles back in the pines.\n\nBut it was not the presence of the girl here on the island at daybreak\nthat surprised him most, but the appearance of the girl herself. He sat\nstaring at her dumbly, wondering if he were awake or dreaming. For the\ngirl--who otherwise might have appeared nothing more than an\nextraordinarily beautiful young female of this earth, somewhat\nfantastically dressed--the girl had wings!\n\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked again. There was no doubt about it--they\nwere huge, deep-red feathered wings, reaching from her shoulder blades\nnearly to the ground. She took a step away from the tree and flapped them\nonce or twice idly. Alan could see they would measure nearly ten feet from\ntip to tip when outstretched. His launch had lost its forward motion now,\nand for the moment was lying motionless in the sluggish bayou. Hardly\nfifty feet separated him from the girl.\n\nHer eyes stared into his for a time--a quiet, curious stare, with no hint\nof fear in it. Then she smiled. Her lips moved, but the soft words that\nreached him across the water were in a language he could not understand.\nBut he comprehended her gesture; it distinctly bade him come ashore. Alan\ntook a new grip on himself, gathered his scattered wits, and tried to\nthink connectedly.\n\nHe laid his rifle in the bottom of the launch; then, just as he was\nreaching for an oar, he saw back among the tall cabbage palms on the\nisland in an open space, a glowing, silvery object, like a house painted\nsilver and shining under the rays of a brilliant sun.\n\nThen the whole thing came to him. He remembered the press descriptions\nfrom Wyoming of the Mercutian vehicle. He saw this white rectangle on the\nlittle Florida island as a miniature of that which had brought the\ninvaders of Wyoming from space. And then this girl--\n\nFear for an instant supplanted amazement in Alan Newland's heart. He\nlooked around. He could see back into the trees plainly, almost across the\nisland. He stood up in the boat. There seemed no one else in sight.\n\nAlan sat down and, taking up the oar, sculled the launch toward the spot\nwhere the girl was standing. His mind still refused to think clearly. The\nvague thought came to him that he might be struck dead by some unknown\npower the instant he landed. Then, as he again met the girl's eyes--a\nclear, direct, honest gaze with something of a compelling dignity in\nit--his fear suddenly left him.\n\nA moment later the bow of the launch pushed its way through the wire grass\nand touched the bank. Alan laid aside his oar, tied the boat to a\nhalf-submerged log, and stepped ashore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nCAPTURED!\n\n\nWhen I recovered consciousness I found myself lying in the sand with\nMercer sitting beside me. It was still night. The tangled wreckage of our\nairplane lay near by; evidently Mercer had carried me out of it.\n\nI sat up.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" I said. \"What happened?\"\n\nHe grinned at me with relief.\n\n\"The damned engine stopped. I don't know what was the matter. You had the\nlight off. I couldn't see anything when we got down close.\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the wrecked plane.\n\n\"It's done for,\" he added; \"but I'm not hurt much. Are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I'm all right.\"\n\nI climbed to my feet unsteadily; my head seemed about to split open.\n\n\"Garland's burning,\" he added.\n\nOver the desert, some two or three miles away, the burning town could be\nseen plainly.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" Mercer asked after a moment.\n\nI was pretty weak and badly bruised all over. Mercer seemed to have fared\nbetter than I. We talked over our situation at length. Finally we decided\nto rest where we were until daybreak. I would feel better then, and we\ncould start back on foot for Mantua and Frannie.\n\nI lay down again--my head was going round like a top--and Mercer sat\nbeside me. It was pretty cold, but we were warmly dressed and not\nuncomfortable. The fact that we were so close to the Mercutians--not much\nover seven or eight miles--worried us a little. But we reasoned that we\nwere in no great danger. We could still see their light-ray standing\nvertically in the air.\n\nOccasionally it would swing slowly to one side or the other. Once it swung\ntoward us, but as its base was in a hollow, it was cut off by the higher\nground between as it swung down, and we knew it could not reach us from\nthat position.\n\nAfter a while I fell asleep. When Mercer woke me up it was dawn.\n\n\"Let's get started,\" he said. \"I'm hungry as the devil.\"\n\nI felt much better now. I was hungry myself, and stiff, and chilled.\n\n\"You'll feel better walking,\" he added. \"Come on. It'll take us a deuce of\na while over this sand.\"\n\nWe decided to strike for the railroad at its closest point to us. The\nState automobile road to Cody ran along near the railroad, and we planned\nto follow that up to Mantua.\n\nAfter a last look at our plane, which was hopelessly demolished, we\nstarted off, heading north of Garland. We had been walking along a few\nminutes when Mercer suddenly gripped me by the arm. I followed the\ndirection of his glance. Another rocket was rising from the Mercutian\nbase. It was still dark enough for us to see its flare as it rose and\ncurved in a long, graceful arc. We stopped stock still and stood watching.\nThe rocket arched over to the north. As it came down we lost sight of it.\n\n\"That went into Mantua,\" said Mercer in a horrified whisper.\n\nA moment later we saw, in the direction of Mantua, that brief, silent,\nsmokeless red and green flash. Then the sky lighted up a lurid red, and we\nknew Mantua was burning.\n\nWe stood looking at each other for a time, too frightened and horrified\nfor words. The thing was not like modern warfare. It was uncanny in its\nsilent deadliness, and there seemed a surety about it that was appalling.\n\n\"We're cut off,\" said Mercer finally.\n\nHis face was white and his voice trembled.\n\nWe were both pretty much unnerved, but after a moment we got ourselves\ntogether and talked calmly about what was best for us to do.\n\nWe concluded finally to go ahead to the road. We calculated we were not\nover two miles from the nearest part of it. We would strike it about\nhalfway between Garland and Mantua, and we thought it just possible we\nwould find passing along it some refugees from the two towns. I couldn't\nquite see how meeting them could help us any, unless we encountered some\nvehicle that would give us a lift. However, the walking would be easier,\nand when we got to the road we could decide which way to go--north to\nFrannie, or south around Garland to Powell.\n\nThe sun was just rising when we started again. It took us nearly an hour\nto reach the road. As far as we could see it was deserted. We stopped here\nand held another consultation.\n\n\"It's easily twelve miles up to Frannie,\" I said, \"and I don't believe\nmore than eight to Powell. Let's go that way. We can get down to Cody from\nthere. I guess there are still people left in Powell.\"\n\nWe started down the road toward Garland. It seemed the sensible thing to\ndo. We were both famished by now and thirsty also. I had an idea that,\nsince the fires in Garland were about burned out, there might be an\nisolated house unharmed, where we could find food and water.\n\nI sometimes wonder now at our temerity in venturing so calmly to face this\nunknown danger. We were in the enemy's country--an enemy whose methods of\nattacking us might at any moment prove a hundred times more efficacious\nthan they had so far. But we did not consider that then.\n\nThere was, indeed, nothing else we could have done advantageously. This\nroad we were on was the only one within twenty or thirty miles. To have\nstruck west from our wrecked plane--away from the Mercutians--would have\nbrought us to face a hundred miles or more of desert over to the\nYellowstone.\n\nIt was now broad daylight--and almost cloudless, as is usual in this\nlocality. Half an hour of walking brought us nearly to the outskirts of\nGarland. There was less smoke all the time. We judged the fire must be\npretty well burned out by now. Behind us the smoke of Mantua, a much\nlarger town than Garland, rose in a great rolling cloud.\n\nWe were walking along, wondering what we should find ahead, when suddenly\nbehind Garland and off to the right we saw another huge cloud of smoke\nrising.\n\n\"Powell!\" ejaculated Mercer, coming to a dead stop in the road. \"Good God,\nthey've got Powell, too!\"\n\nThere was no doubt about it--the town of Powell was also in flames. We sat\ndown together then at the side of the road. We didn't quite know what else\nto do. We were both faint. Our situation seemed every moment to be getting\nworse; we appeared further from even comparative safety now than when we\nleft our plane at dawn.\n\nThere seemed nothing else to do now but go ahead into Garland, a distance\nof only half a mile. There we might find food and water; and, thus\nrefreshed, we could start back north to cover the fifteen miles to\nFrannie.\n\nGarland, a few days before, was a town of about five hundred inhabitants;\nbut I do not suppose that, at the time of its destruction, there were more\nthan a score or two of people remaining in it.\n\nWe started off again, and within twenty minutes were among the smoldering\nhouses of the town. It consisted practically of only one street--the road\nwe were on--with the houses strung along it. The houses had been, most of\nthem, small frame structures. They were nothing now but smoldering heaps\nof ashes with the chimneys left standing, like gaunt, silent sentinels. As\nwe passed on down the road we saw several twisted forms that we took for\nthe remains of human beings. It is unnecessary for me to describe them. We\nhurried on, shuddering.\n\nOur objective was the lower end of the town, for there, perhaps a quarter\nof a mile off to one side with a branch road leading to it, we saw a\nsingle house and out-buildings left standing. We turned down this road and\napproached the house. It was a rather good-looking building of the\nbungalow type with a wide-spreading porch. Beside it stood a long, low,\nrectangular building we took to be a garage. There was an automobile\nstanding in the doorway, and behind it we caught the white gleam of an\nairplane wing.\n\n\"We're all right now,\" cried Mercer. \"There's a car, and there's a plane\ninside. One of them ought to run.\"\n\nAt this unexpected good fortune we were jubilant. We could get back to\nBillings now in short order.\n\nWe climbed up the porch steps and entered the house. We did not call out,\nfor it seemed obvious that no one would be there after what had occurred\nin Garland so near by.\n\n\"There must be something to eat here,\" I said. \"Let's find out--and then\nget back to Billings.\"\n\nThe big living room was empty, but there was no sign of disorder. A closed\ndoor stood near at hand.\n\n\"That might be the way to the kitchen,\" I suggested. \"Come on.\"\n\nI pushed open the door and entered, with Mercer close behind me. It was a\nbedroom. The bed stood over by a window. I stopped in horror, for on the\nbed, hunched forward in a sitting position, was the body of a man!\n\nWith the first sudden shock of surprise over, we stopped to note details.\nThe man's hand, lying on the blanket, clutched a revolver. A mirror\ndirectly across from him was shattered as though by a bullet. A small\nbedroom chair was overturned near the center of the room.\n\n\"He--he isn't burned.\" Mercer spoke the words hardly above a whisper.\n\"Something else killed him--there's been a fight. They--\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\nA sudden panic seized me. I wanted to run--to do something--anything--that\nwould get me away from the nameless, silent terror that seemed all about.\n\n\"Come on,\" I whispered back. \"God! Let's get out of here.\"\n\nAs we got out into the living room we heard slow, dragging footsteps on\nthe porch outside. We stopped again, shrinking back against the wall.\n\n\"They--they--it's--\" Mercer's whispered words died away. We were both\nterrified beyond the power of reasoning. The dragging footsteps came\ncloser--a sound that had in it nothing of human tread. Then we heard soft\nvoices--words that were unintelligible.\n\n\"It's the Mercutians,\" I found voice to whisper. \"They--\"\n\nA figure appeared in the porch doorway, outlined against the light\nbehind--the figure of a short, squat man. He seemed to have on some sort\nof white, furry garment. He was bareheaded, with hair falling to his\nshoulders.\n\nAt the sight of him my terror suddenly left me. Here was an enemy I could\ncope with. The dread fear of supernatural beings that had possessed me\nevaporated.\n\nWith a shout to Mercer I dashed forward directly at the doorway. I think\nthe Mercutian had not yet seen us; he stood quite still, his body blocking\nthe full width of the doorway.\n\nI let fly with my fist as I came up and hit him full in the face. At the\nsame instant my body struck his. He toppled backward and I went through\nthe doorway. I tripped over him on the porch outside and fell sprawling.\nBefore I could rise three other Mercutians fell upon me and pinned me\ndown.\n\nMercer was right behind me in the doorway. I saw him pause an instant to\nsee what was happening. There seemed to be five Mercutians altogether. The\none I had hit lay quite still. Three others were holding me.\n\nThe fifth stood to one side, watching Mercer, but apparently inactive.\n\nI saw Mercer hesitate. An expression of surprise came over his face. His\nbody swayed; he took a single step forward, half turned, and then fell in\na crumpled heap.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nMIELA.\n\n\nThe girl stood quiet beside the tree, watching Alan as he tied up his\nboat. She continued smiling. Alan stood up and faced her. He wondered what\nhe should say--whether she could understand him any better than he could\nher.\n\n\"You speak English?\" he began hesitantly.\n\nThe girl did not answer at once; she seemed to be trying to divine his\nmeaning. Then she waved her hand--a curious movement, which he took to be\na gesture of negation--her broadening smile disclosing teeth that were\nsmall, even, and very white.\n\nAt this closer view Alan could see she was apparently about twenty years\nold, as time is reckoned on earth. Her body was very slender, gracefully\nrounded, yet with an appearance of extreme fragility. Her slenderness, and\nthe long, sleek wings behind, made her appear taller than she really was;\nactually she was about the height of a normal woman of our own race.\n\nHer legs were covered by a pair of trousers of some silky fabric, grayish\nblue in color. Her bare feet were incased in sandals, the golden cords of\nwhich crossed her insteps and wound about her ankles, fastening down the\nlower hems of the trousers. A silken, gray-blue scarf was wound about her\nwaist; crossing in front, it passed up over her breast and shoulders,\ncrossing again between the wings behind and descending to the waist.\n\nHer hair was a smooth, glossy black. It was parted in the middle, covered\nher ears, and came forward over each shoulder. The plaits were bound\ntightly around with silken cords; each was fastened to her body in two\nplaces, at the waist and, where the plait ended, the outside of the\ntrouser leg just above the knee.\n\nHer skin was cream colored, smooth in texture, and with a delicate flush\nof red beneath the surface. Her eyes were black, her face small and oval,\nwith a delicately pointed chin. There was nothing remarkable about her\nfeatures except that they were extraordinarily beautiful. But--and this\npoint Alan noticed at once--there was in her expression, in the delicacy\nof her face, a spiritual look that he had never seen in a woman before. It\nmade him trust her; and--even then, I think--love her, too.\n\nSuch was the strange girl as Alan saw her that morning standing beside the\ntree on the bank of the little Florida bayou.\n\n\"I can't talk your language,\" said Alan. He realized it was a silly thing\nto say. But his smile answered hers, and he went forward until he was\nstanding close beside her. She did not appear so tall now, for he towered\nover her, the strength and bigness of his frame making hers seem all the\nfrailer by contrast.\n\nHe held out his hand. The girl looked at it, puzzled.\n\n\"Won't you shake hands?\" he said; and then he realized that, too, was a\nsilly remark.\n\nShe wrinkled up her forehead in thought; then, with a sudden\ncomprehension, she laughed--a soft little ripple of laughter--and placed\nher hand awkwardly in his.\n\nAs he released her hand she reached hers forward and brushed it lightly\nagainst his cheek. Alan understood that was her form of greeting. Then she\nspread her wings and curtsied low--making as charming a picture, he\nthought, as he had ever seen in his life.\n\nAs she straightened up her eyes laughed into his, and again she spoke a\nfew soft words--wholly unintelligible. Then she pointed toward the sun,\nwhich was still low over the horizon, and then to the silver object lying\nback near the center of the island.\n\n\"I know,\" said Alan. \"Mercury.\"\n\nThe girl repeated his last word immediately, enunciating it almost\nperfectly. Then she laid her hand upon her breast, saying: \"Miela.\"\n\n\"Alan,\" he answered, indicating himself.\n\nThe girl laughed delightedly, repeating the word several times. Then she\ntook him by the hand and made him understand that she wished to lead him\nback into the island.\n\nThey started off, and then Alan noticed a curious thing. She walked as\nthough weighted to the ground by some invisible load. She did not raise\nher feet normally, but dragged them, like a diver who walks on land in his\nheavily weighted iron shoes. After a few steps she spread her wings, and,\nflapping them slowly, was able to get along better, although it was\nobvious that she could not lift her body off the ground to fly.\n\nFor a moment Alan was puzzled, then he understood. The force of gravity on\nearth was too great for the power of her muscles, which were developed\nonly to meet the pull of Mercury--a very much smaller planet.\n\nThe girl was so exceedingly frail Alan judged she did not weigh, here on\nearth, much over a hundred pounds. But even that he could see was too much\nfor her. She could not fly, and it was only by the aid of her wings that\nshe was able to walk with anything like his own freedom of movement.\n\nHe made her understand, somehow, that he comprehended her plight. Then,\nafter a time, he put his left arm about her waist. She spread the great\nred wings out behind him, the right one passing over his shoulder; and in\nthis fashion they went forward more easily.\n\nThe girl kept constantly talking and gesturing. She seemed remarkably\nintelligent; and even then, at the very beginning of their\nacquaintanceship, she made Alan understand that she intended to learn his\nlanguage. Indeed, she seemed concerned about little else; and she went\nabout her task systematically and with an ability that amazed him.\n\nAs they walked forward she kept continually stooping to touch objects on\nthe ground--a stick, a handful of sand, a woodland flower, or a palmetto\nleaf. Or, again, she would indicate articles of his clothing, or his\nfeatures. In each case Alan gave her the English word; and in each case\nshe repeated it after him.\n\nOnce she stopped stock still, and with astonishing rapidity and accuracy\nrattled off the whole list--some fifteen or twenty words\naltogether--pointing out each object as she enunciated the word.\n\nAlan understood then--and he found out afterward it was the case--that the\ngirl's memory was extraordinarily retentive, far more retentive than is\nthe case with any normal earth person. He discovered also, a little later,\nthat her intuitive sense was highly developed. She seemed, in many\ninstances, to divine his meaning, quite apart from his words or the\ngestures--which often were unintelligible to her--with which he\naccompanied them.\n\nAfter a time they reached the Mercutian vehicle. It was a cubical box,\nwith a pyramid-shaped top, some thirty feet square at the base, and\nevidently constructed of metal, a gleaming white nearer like silver than\nanything else Alan could think of. He saw that it had a door on the side\nfacing him, and several little slitlike windows, covered by a thick,\ntransparent substance which might have been glass.\n\nAs they got up close to it Alan expected the girl's companions to come\nout. His heart beat faster. Suddenly he raised his voice and shouted:\n\"Hello, inside!\"\n\nThe girl looked startled. Then she smiled and made the negative gesture\nwith her hand.\n\nAlan understood then that she was alone. They went inside the vehicle. It\nwas dark in there. Alan could make out little, but after a moment his eyes\ngrew accustomed to the darkness.\n\nHe noticed first that the thing was very solidly constructed. He expected\nto see some complicated mechanism, but there was little or nothing of the\nkind so far as he could make out in the darkness in this first hurried\ninspection.\n\nFastened to one wall was an apparatus which he judged was for the making\nof oxygen. He looked around for batteries, and for electric lights, but\ncould see nothing of the kind.\n\nAll this time Alan's mind had been busily trying to puzzle out the mystery\nof the girl's presence here alone. Evidently she came in the most friendly\nspirit; and thus, quite evidently, her mission, whatever it was, must be\nvery different from that of the invaders who had landed almost\nsimultaneously in Wyoming.\n\nWhatever it was that had brought her--whatever her purpose--he realized it\nmust be important. The girl, even now, seemed making no effort to show or\nexplain anything to him, but continued plying him with questions that gave\nher the English words of everything about them that she could readily\nindicate.\n\nAlan knew then that she must have something important to\ncommunicate--something that she wanted to say as quickly as possible. And\nhe knew that she realized the only way was for her to learn his language,\nwhich she was doing with the least possible loss of time, and with an\nutter disregard of everything else that might have obtruded.\n\nAlan decided then to take the girl back home with him--indeed, it had\nnever been in his mind to do anything else--and let Beth care for her.\nMeanwhile he would do everything he could to help her get the knowledge\nnecessary to make known what it was that had brought her from Mercury.\nThat she had some direct connection with the Wyoming invaders he did not\ndoubt.\n\nAlan had just reached this decision when the girl made him realize that\nshe had the same thought in mind. She pointed around the room and then to\nherself, and he knew that she was insisting upon a general word to include\nall her surroundings.\n\nFinally Alan answered: \"House.\"\n\nAfter pointing to him, she waved her hand vaguely toward the country\noutside the open doorway, and he understood she was asking where his house\nwas.\n\nAlan's decision was given promptly. \"We'll go there,\" he said.\n\nHe put his arm about her and started out. By the way she immediately\nresponded he knew she understood, and that it was what she wished to do.\n\nThey got back to Alan's launch in a few moments. He seated her in the\nstern of the boat, where she half reclined with her wings spread out a\nlittle behind her. So assiduous was she--and so facile--in her task of\nlearning English, that before she would let him start the motor she had\nlearned the names of many of the new objects in sight, and several verbs\nconnected with his actions of the moment.\n\nThere was a large tarpaulin in the launch, and this Alan wrapped about the\ngirl's shoulders. He did not want her vivid red wings to be seen by any\none as they passed down the bayou.\n\nFinally they started off.\n\nProfessor Newland's home was some three miles from the village of Bay\nHead, on the shore of a large bay which opened into the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe bayou down which they were heading flowed into this bay near where the\nhouse stood. Their home was quite isolated, Alan thought with\nsatisfaction. There was no other habitation nearer than Bay Head except a\nfew negro shacks. With the girl's wings covered he could take her home and\nkeep her there, in absolute seclusion, without causing any comment that\nmight complicate things.\n\nOn the way down the bayou the girl showed extreme interest in everything\nabout her. She seemed to have no fear, trusting Alan implicitly in his\nguidance and protection of her in this strange world. She continued her\nquestions; she laughed frequently, with almost a childlike freedom from\ncare. Only once or twice, he noticed, as some thought occurred to her, the\nlaughter died away, her face suddenly sobered, and a far-away, misty look\ncame into her beautiful eyes.\n\nAlan sat close beside her in the stern, steering the launch and\noccasionally pulling the tarpaulin back onto her shoulders when it\nthreatened to slip off because of her impetuous gestures.\n\nThey saw only a few negroes as they passed down the bayou, and these paid\nno particular attention to them. Within an hour Alan had the girl safely\ninside the bungalow, and was introducing her, with excited explanations,\nto his astonished father and sister, who were just at that moment sitting\ndown to breakfast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nTHE MERCUTIAN CAMP.\n\n\nAs I saw Mercer fall to the floor of the porch a sudden rage swept over\nme. I struggled violently with the three men pinning me down. They\nappeared very much weaker than I, but even though I could break their\nholds the three of them were more than a match for me.\n\nThe man who was standing inactive, and who I realized had struck down\nMercer in some unknown, deadly way, appeared to be the leader. Once, as\none of my assailants made some move, the import of which the leader\nevidently understood, but which I did not, I heard him give a sharp\ncommand. It occurred to me then that if I offered too much resistance--if\nit seemed I was likely to get away from them--I might possibly be struck\nas swiftly as Mercer had been. So I gave up abruptly and lay still.\n\nThey must have understood my motive--or perhaps they felt that I was not\nworth the trouble of taking alive--for immediately I stopped struggling\nthey unhanded me and rose to their feet.\n\nI stood up also, deciding to appear quite docile, for the time being at\nany rate, until I could comprehend better with what I had to contend.\n\nThe man who appeared to be their leader issued another command. One of\nthe men with whom I had been struggling immediately stepped a few feet\naway, out of my reach. I knew he had been told to guard me. He kept just\nthat distance away thereafter, following my movements closely and seeming\nnever to take his eyes off me for a moment.\n\nI had opportunity now to inspect these strange enemies more closely. The\nleader was the tallest. He was about five and a half feet in height, I\njudged, and fairly stocky. The others were all considerably shorter--not\nmuch over five feet, perhaps. All were broad-framed, although not stout\nto any degree approaching fatness.\n\nFrom their appearance, they might all have been fairly powerful men, the\nleader especially. But even the short struggle I had had with them showed\nme they were not. Their bodies, too, had seemed under my grip to have a\nflimsy quality, a lack of firmness, of solidity, entirely belied by their\nappearance.\n\nThey were all dressed in a single rude garment of short white fur, made\nall in one piece, trousers and shirt, and leaving only their arms bare.\nTheir feet were incased in buskins that seemed to be made of leather.\nTheir hair was a reddish-brown color, and fell scraggling a little below\nthe shoulder line.\n\nTheir skin was a curious, dead white--like the pallor of a man long in\nprison. Their faces, which had no sign of hair on them, were broad, with\nbroad flat noses, and with abnormally large eyes that seemed to blink\nstolidly with an owl-like stare.\n\nTheir leader was of somewhat different type. He was, as I have said,\nnearly six inches taller than the others, and leaner and more powerful\nlooking. His hair was black, and his skin was not so dead white. His eyes\nwere not so abnormally large as those of his companions. His nose was\nstraight, with a high bridge. His face was hairless. It was a strong\nface, with an expression of dignity about it, a consciousness of power,\nand a certain sense of cruelty expressed in the firmness of his lips and\nthe set of his chin.\n\nNone of them was armed--or, at least, their weapons were not visible to\nme.\n\nI was much concerned about Mercer. He and the man I had hit were both\nlying motionless where they had fallen. I stooped over Mercer. No one\noffered to stop me, although when I moved I saw my guard make a swift\nmovement with his hand to his belt. My heart leaped to my throat, but\nnothing happened to me, and I made a hasty examination of Mercer.\n\nQuite evidently he was dead.\n\nMeanwhile the Mercutians were examining their fallen comrade. He also was\ndead, I judged from their actions. They left him where he was lying, and\ntheir leader impatiently signed me toward the steps that led down from\nthe porch to the roadway. We started off, my guard keeping close behind\nme. I noticed then how curiously hampered the Mercutians seemed to be in\ntheir movements.\n\nI have explained how Alan observed the effect of our earth's gravity on\nMiela. It was even more marked with the Mercutians here, for she had the\nassistance of wings, while they did not. The realization of this\nencouraged me tremendously. I knew now that physically these enemies were\nno match for me; that I could break away from them whenever I wished.\n\nBut the way in which Mercer had been killed--that I could not understand.\nIt was that I had to guard against. I was afraid to do anything that\nwould expose me to this unknown attack.\n\nI tried to guess over how great a distance this weapon, whatever it was,\nwould prove effective. I assumed only a limited number of feet, although\nmy only reason for thinking so was my guard's evident determination to\nkeep close to me.\n\nAll this flashed through my mind while we were descending the steps to\nthe roadway. When we reached the ground we turned back toward the garage,\nand with slow, plodding steps the leader of the Mercutians preceded me to\nits entrance, his companions following close behind me. They had\nevidently been here before, I could tell from their actions. I realized\nthat probably they had all been inside the garage when Mercer and I first\napproached the house.\n\nIt was quite apparent now that the Mercutians did not understand the use\nof either automobiles or airplanes; they poked around these as though\nthey were some strange, silent animals. Inside the garage I was ordered\nto stand quiet, with my guard near by, while the rest of them continued\nwhat appeared to be a search about the building.\n\nWe passed by the house, and I realized that we were starting for the\nMercutian base some four miles away. I remembered then that I was\nextremely hungry and thirsty. I stopped suddenly and endeavored to\nexplain my wants, indicating the house as a place where I could get food.\n\nThe leader smiled. His name was Tao, I had learned from hearing his men\naddress him. I do not know why that smile reassured me, but it did. It\nseemed somehow to make these enemies less inhuman--less supernatural--in\nmy mind. Indeed, I was fast losing my first fear of them, although I\nstill had a great respect for the way in which they had killed Mercer.\n\nTao told his men to wait, and motioned me toward the house. The bodies of\nMercer and the man I had struck down were still lying where they had\nfallen on the porch. We found food and water in the kitchen, and I sat\ndown and made a meal, while Tao stood watching me. When I had finished I\nput several slices of bread and meat in my coat. He signified that it was\nunnecessary, but I insisted, and he smiled again and let me have my way.\n\nAgain we started off. This walk of four miles of desert that lay between\nGarland and the point on the Shoshone River where the invaders were\nestablished was about all I could manage, for I was almost exhausted. I\nrealized then how great an exertion the Mercutians were put to, for they\nseemed nearly as tired as I. We stopped frequently to rest, and it was\nwell after noon when we approached the hollow through which the Shoshone\nRiver ran.\n\nSeveral times I noticed where the Mercutian Light had burned off the\nscrubby desert vegetation. As we got closer I could see it now in the\nsunlight, standing vertically up in the air, motionless. There were signs\nall about now where the light had burned. We were passing along a little\ngully--the country here was somewhat rough and broken up--when something\ncame abruptly from behind a rock. Its extraordinary appearance startled\nme so I stared at it in amazement and fear. It came closer, and I saw it\nwas one of the Mercutians.\n\nHe was completely incased in a suit of dull black cloth, or rubber, or\nsomething of the kind. On his head was a helmet of the same material,\nwith a mask over his face having two huge circular openings covered with\na flexible, transparent substance. On his back was a sort of tank with a\npipe leading to his mouth. He looked, indeed, something like a man in a\ndiving suit, and still more like the pictures I had seen of soldiers in\nthe World War with gas masks on. He pulled off his helmet as he came up\nto us, and I saw he was similar in appearance to the red-haired\nMercutians who had captured me.\n\nAfter a short conversation with Tao he went back to his station by the\nrock, and we proceeded onward down the gully to the river bank. I saw a\nnumber of Mercutians dressed this way during the afternoon. They seemed\nto be guarding the approaches to the camp, and I decided later this\ncostume was for protection against the effects of the light-ray.\n\nThe Shoshone River was at this point about two hundred feet wide, and at\nthis season of the year a swift-moving, icy stream some two or three feet\ndeep. There were small trees at intervals along its banks. All about me\nnow I could see where they had been burned by the action of the light.\n\nThe vehicle in which the invaders had arrived lay on the near side of the\nriver, some five hundred feet below where we came out of the gully. It\nwas similar in appearance to the one Alan had found in Florida, only many\ntimes larger. It lay there now, with its pyramid-shaped top pointing up\ninto the air, close beside the river, and gleaming a dazzling white under\nthe rays of the afternoon sun.\n\nThere were perhaps a hundred Mercutians in sight altogether. Most of them\nwere down by the vehicle; all of them were on this side of the river. In\nfact, as I soon realized, it would have been difficult, if not\nimpossible, for them to have crossed. The desert on the opposite side of\nthe Shoshone was level and unbroken. It was swept clear of everything,\napparently, by the light-ray.\n\nWe turned down the river bank, and soon were close to the shining vehicle\nthat had brought these strange invaders from space. What would I see in\nthis camp of the first beings to reach earth from another planet? What\nfate awaited me there? These questions hammered at my brain as we\napproached the point where so much death and destruction had been dealt\nout to the surrounding country.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nTHE ESCAPE.\n\n\nThe Mercutians all regarded me curiously as we came among them. By the\nrespect they accorded Tao, and his attitude toward them, I decided he was\nthe leader of the entire party. I stopped, wondering what would happen\nnext. The man guarding me was still close at hand. Tao spoke a few words\nto him and then moved away. My guard immediately sat down. I saw nothing\nwas required of me at the moment, and sat down also.\n\nI had opportunity now to examine the strange things and people about me\nmore in detail. The Mercutians all seemed to be of the same short, squat,\nred-haired type. Tao was, indeed, the only one I saw who had black hair;\nand he was the tallest, and by far the most commanding looking figure of\nthem all.\n\nThey wore several different costumes, although the garment of white fur\nwas the most common. A few were dressed in the black costume of the guard\nin the gully. Still others were garbed only in short, wide trousers and\nshirts of a soft leather, with legs bare from the knee down, and with\nleather buskins on their feet.\n\nThe light-ray was set up near the river, on a metallic structure\nsupporting a small platform some thirty feet above the ground. A ladder\nup one side gave access to this platform from below. The light itself\ncame from a cubical metallic box, perhaps six feet square, suspended\nabove the platform in a balancing mechanism that allowed it to swing in\nall directions.\n\nAll the metal of this apparatus, the projector, the platform and its\nframework, was apparently of the same kind; it had the appearance of\nburnished copper. The whole seemed fairly complicated, but not unlike a\nhuge searchlight would appear if mounted that way.\n\nComing out of the projector and running down to the ground were black\nwires, which led to a metallic box a few feet away. This box was\nrectangular in shape; six feet long, perhaps, two feet broad, and the\nsame in depth. I judged it to be the dynamo or battery from which the\nprojector was supplied with the light-ray.\n\nA short distance back from the river I saw what appeared to be a small\nmortar, which I assumed was for the sending of the light-rockets, or\nbombs. Several other light-ray projectors, sections of their supporting\nstructures, and the unassembled parts of other apparatus, were lying\nscattered about the ground. A considerable number of the Mercutians were\nlaboriously bringing out of the vehicle still more apparatus.\n\nIt was obvious to me then that they were only just getting started in\ntheir offensive and defensive preparations. This I could easily\nunderstand when I had watched for a moment the activities going on. All\nof the apparatus which they were engaged in bringing out and assembling\nwas of metal, and it was so extremely heavy here on earth that they could\nhardly handle it.\n\nStanding on the platform beside the light-ray projector were two men\nevidently in charge of it at the moment. They were dressed in black, with\nblack gloves, although without helmets. I noticed that they had little\npads over their ears, with wires running from them down to a small box at\nthe waist.\n\nOnce I saw one of them look up sharply, as though he had heard something;\nand, following the wave of his hand, I saw the tiny black-garbed figure\nof a man on the higher ground behind the gully through which we had come.\nI reasoned then that this was a lookout stationed there, and that he was\ndirecting the action of the light by some form of wireless telephony.\n\nFor perhaps an hour I sat there, with my guard near by watching me. I was\nsorry, now that I found myself in the midst of these enemies, that I had\nnot made a determined effort to escape earlier in the day, when there\nwould have been only four of them to cope with.\n\nI realized that I didn't know any more now about the power this guard had\nover me than I had at the beginning. He certainly looked inoffensive,\nsitting there, but the very calmness with which he watched me made me\nfeel I would be taking a desperate chance in attempting to escape. I\ndecided then to wait until nightfall and to watch a favorable opportunity\nto break away.\n\nUnder cover of darkness, if once I could get out of their sight, I was\nsatisfied they would never catch me. It was my plan to strike back to\nGarland. I had noticed carefully the lay of the land coming over, and\nbelieved I could find my way back. Then, with the car or the plane that\nwas there in the garage, I could get back to Billings.\n\nThese thoughts were running through my mind when Tao abruptly presented\nhimself before me and ordered me to get up. I did so, smiling in as\nfriendly a fashion as I could manage. He then made me assist in the work\nof carrying the heavy pieces of apparatus. Apparently he was determined\nthat I, as an earth man, should work hard, since the Mercutians were so\nheavily handicapped by the gravity of my planet. I concluded that it\nwould be my best policy to help them all I could--that by so doing they\nmight relax a little in their watchfulness, and thus enable me to get\naway that night.\n\nI signified to Tao my understanding of what he was after, and made them\nall see my entire readiness and ability to help. For the rest of the\nafternoon I was dragging about from place to place, carrying the\nprojectors to the various positions where they had decided to put them\nup. It seemed to be their plan to establish some twenty or thirty\nprojectors around the vehicle; they were setting them all at points about\na hundred yards away from it. These projectors differed in size and\nshape. Some were cubical, others pyramid-shaped, open at the base as\nthough to send out the light in a spreading ray.\n\nI saw now, when I had a chance to inspect the projectors closer, that\nthey were black outside and like burnished copper inside, to reflect the\nlight. I judged that this black covering must have been like the black\nsuits worn by some of the men, and that it was impervious to the\nlight-ray. Near the center of each projector was a coil of wire. The\nwires from outside ran to it, and across the open face of the projector\na large number of fine lateral wires ran parallel, very close together.\n\nThese were about all the details I noticed. I wanted to remember them,\nalthough they conveyed very little to me, because I realized all this I\nwas seeing might prove of immense help to the authorities when I got back\nto Billings.\n\nNight came, and I was still at work. Tao seemed tremendously pleased at\nwhat I was doing, and I noticed with satisfaction that his attitude\ntoward me seemed gradually changing. My guard still followed me about,\nbut he did not watch me quite so closely now, I thought.\n\nMy help, that afternoon, was considerable. I was by far the strongest man\nin the camp; and, more than that, I was able to move about so much faster\nthan they that I could do things in a few moments that would have taken\nthem many times as long.\n\nTao personally directed most of my efforts. He told me where to take the\nthings, and I took them, smilingly, and always coming back to him for new\norders. I moved so fast, indeed, that my guard had difficulty in keeping\nclose to me. Several times I experimented and found that I could get away\nfrom him quite a little distance without a protest, either from him or\nfrom Tao.\n\nAs it began to grow dark, they lighted up the camp. This was accomplished\nby little metallic posts that had been set around at intervals. Each had\na tiny coil of wire suspended at its top, which became incandescent and\nthrew out a reddish-green light. Around each light was a square black\nwire cage some three feet in diameter. I conjectured that these lights\nused the same ray as the projectors, only in a different form, and that\nthe cage was to protect any one from going too close. The light from\nthese illuminators was much the same in aspect as the ray, except that it\nseemed to diffuse itself readily and carried only a comparatively short\ndistance.\n\nThe scene now, under this red-green glare, was weird in the extreme. The\nwork all about me went on steadily. The Mercutians were all dressed in\nwhite furry garments now--I concluded because of the cold--with the\nexception of those who had on the suits and helmets of black.\n\nThe reddish-green light made them all appear like little gnomes at work.\nIndeed, the whole scene, with its points of color in the darkness, and the\nhuge monstrous shadows all about, was more like some fantastic picture out\nof a fairy book than a scene on this earth.\n\nSoon after nightfall Tao stopped me, and one of his men brought me\nsomething to eat. I still had the slices of bread and meat in my pocket,\nbut, thinking I might need them later on, I kept them there. Tao and I sat\ndown near one of the lights and ate together. We were served by one of the\nmen. My guard still kept close at hand.\n\nThe food was nothing more than hard pieces of baked dough and a form of\nsweet something like chocolate. For drink there was a hot liquid quite\ncomparable to tea. This was served us in small metal cups with handles\nthat seemed to be insulated from the heat.\n\nThis meal was brought to us from inside the vehicle. While we were eating\nI could see many of the Mercutians going inside and coming out with pieces\nof this food in their hands, eating as they worked. Quite obviously the\nbusiness of assembling their apparatus was uppermost in the minds of all\nof them.\n\nThe whole atmosphere about the place, I realized now, in spite of the\nopposite effect their dragging footsteps gave, was one of feverish\nactivity. When we had eaten Tao seemed willing to sit quiet for a while.\nMy efforts to talk to him amused us both greatly, and I noticed with\nsatisfaction that he seemed to trust me more and more.\n\nFinally my guard spoke, asking permission, I judged, to leave us and go\nhave his dinner. My heart leaped into my throat as I saw him go, leaving\nme alone with Tao. I concluded that now, if ever, was my opportunity. Tao\ntrusted me--seemed to like me, in fact. No one else in the camp was paying\nthe least attention to us. If only I could, on some pretext, get myself a\nreasonable distance away from him I would make a run for it.\n\nI was turning this problem over in my mind when it was unexpectedly solved\nfor me. A low throbbing, growing momentarily louder, sounded from the\nair--the hum of an airplane motor. I think Tao noticed it first--I saw him\ncock his head to one side, listening.\n\nAfter a moment, as the sound increased, he climbed to his feet and shouted\nan order to the man nearest us.\n\nThe night had clouded over; it was unusually dark. I knew that a plane\nwithout lights was approaching. Work about the camp stopped; every one\nstood listening. I looked up at the light-ray platform. The two men there\nwere swinging the light back and forth, sweeping the sky.\n\nSuddenly the sound ceased; the plane's motor had been shut off. Almost at\nthe same instant the light-ray picked up the plane. It was several\nthousand feet in the air and almost over our heads, coming down in a\nspiral. A moment more and the light-ray swung away.\n\nThe plane burst into flame, and I knew it was falling. An explosion\nsounded near at hand. The camp was in chaos immediately. I faced about to\nlook at Tao; he had disappeared.\n\nI waited no longer. Turning back from the river, I ran at full speed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nFUTILE ATTACKS.\n\n\nThere seemed to be no pursuit. In a few moments I was clear of the camp\nand hidden in the darkness of the desert. I ran perhaps half a mile, then\nI slowed down to a walk, completely winded. Turning, I could see behind me\nthe lights of the camp. I doubted if even now they had missed me. The bomb\ndropped by the airplane and the plane itself falling almost, in their\nmidst must have plunged them for the time into confusion.\n\nI kept on walking rapidly. The desert here was almost pathless;\noccasionally I would cross a wandering wagon track, but none of them\nseemed going in my direction. After a time I was not sure what my\ndirection was; all about me was a luminous darkness--and silence.\n\nI found myself now almost exhausted from my exertions of the day. I\ndecided to go possibly a mile farther--to be well away from the\nMercutians--and then to lie down and sleep until daylight.\n\nIn about fifteen minutes more I concluded I had gone far enough, and,\nlying down on the sand, was soon fast asleep. When I awoke it was\ndaylight, with the sun just rising.\n\nWith returning consciousness I looked about me in sudden fear, but there\nwas no one in sight. I ate the bread and meat I had in my pocket, and,\nfeeling much refreshed, but thirsty, I started again for Garland.\n\nI made the town soon after noon that day. The little automobile was still\nstanding in the garage, and I started it without trouble. Before I left I\nwent up to the porch of the house.\n\nThe bodies of Mercer and the Mercutian were still lying there. I dragged\nMercer's body down the steps and put it into the back seat of the car\nThen I started off. I stuck to the main road, and went through Mantua at\ntop speed, apprehensive that some of the Mercutians might be there. This\ntown, like Garland, was completely burned. Only the chimneys were left\nstanding amid piles of ashes.\n\nAt Frannie I took on two passengers. There was much curiosity on the part\nof those I met along here, but I was unwilling to explain, deciding it\nbest to wait and tell my whole story to the military authorities at\nBillings.\n\nIt was early afternoon when I got back to Billings. This was March 12. I\nturned Mercer's body over to the police, who promptly took me in charge. I\ngave them a brief outline of what had occurred. General Price, whose\ncommand of the United States military operations against the Mercutians\nwas announced to the country two days later, had arrived that morning in\nBillings by airplane. I demanded to see him, and when my business was\nexplained to him he granted me an immediate interview.\n\nGeneral Price was a man about fifty, a kindly gentleman of the old\nSouthern type, yet of thoroughly military demeanor. I told him everything\nthat had happened to me in detail as complete as I possibly could.\nMercer's body was examined that same afternoon. It was found to have been\ndrilled completely through the chest by a hole about the diameter of a\nlead pencil. This hole did not seem to have been made by the passage of\nany foreign object, but had more the aspect of a burn. I understood\nthen--Mercer had been killed by a tiny light-ray projector, with a short,\neffective radius, aimed probably like a revolver.\n\nWhat I was able to tell General Price about the Mercutians naturally was\ninvaluable to him. He asked me then to remain close to him during the\nforthcoming operations. We arranged that I was on honor to give nothing\nout to my paper without his approval.\n\nThe situation, as it appeared during the next few days, was not one of\ngrave danger. We were able to gage now with fair probability of\ncorrectness the offensive strength of our enemies. They had no means of\ntransportation--could only move from their present position slowly and\nwith extreme difficulty. The possibility of the vehicle itself moving\noccurred to us; but, as I pointed out, the task of replacing their heavy\napparatus in it, and then reassembling the apparatus in a new position,\nmade such a step impractical.\n\nThe only weapon the Mercutians had displayed so far was the light-ray in\nits several forms. This seemed effective for ten miles at most. That the\nMercutians could be attacked by our artillery and destroyed seemed\ncertain.\n\nBy the 20th General Price had mobilized some ten thousand men. They\nencamped on the prairie near Billings. The artillery was moved down to a\npoint near the Wyoming State line, about fifteen miles directly north of\nthe Mercutian camp.\n\nSix days before this, forty-eight hours after I had returned to Billings,\nobservation planes had reported the establishment of two more light-rays,\nsimilar in appearance to the first. During the succeeding days others\nrapidly appeared. By the 20th there were probably thirty of them\naltogether.\n\nThe reports stated that all were set up within a space seemingly of a few\nhundred yards. They were of different diameters; some projected in\nparallel rays, others spread out fan-shaped. These latter appeared not to\ncarry so far. The first one that had appeared, it was judged, had the\nlongest effective radius of them all.\n\nDuring these days and nights preceding the 20th the light-rockets had been\nfired with increasing frequency, but none was observed to carry over six\nor eight miles. By this time the burned area for a circle of ten miles all\naround the Mercutian camp was entirely depopulated, and no additional\ndestruction was reported.\n\nOn the night of the 20th, firing by directions from captive balloons, the\nUnited States artillery began its bombardment from the Montana-Wyoming\nline. After sending over some twenty shells, the firing ceased. It was\nlearned then that they had proven utterly ineffective. The diverging rays\nof the Mercutian light had thrown a barrage around their position. The\nshells striking the light had all exploded harmlessly in the air.\n\nSubsequent bombardments made that night met with no better success. The\nfact became obvious then that to artillery fire the Mercutians were\nimpregnable. For several days no further military operations were\nattempted, with the exception of an occasional shell futilely thrown\nagainst the light-rays.\n\nThe newspapers during these days were full of discussions--scientific and\notherwise--as to how this strange enemy of mankind could be destroyed or\ndislodged. This was like no other warfare in history. The newspaper\nstatements gave the inference that General Price was entirely at a loss\nhow to proceed.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the press was quite correct in that assumption; and,\nsince the Mercutians were making no offensive moves, General Price decided\nto do nothing until he was better informed.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be present the next day at a conference the\ngeneral had with several scientific men who had come to Billings to meet\nhim. It was the opinion of these men of science that no artillery fire\ncould penetrate the light-barrage the Mercutians had thrown about them. No\nairplane attack was practical, and to attack them from the ground with\ninfantry would be absurd.\n\nOn the other hand, it seemed obvious that the Mercutians could make no\noffensive move either. They had probably already done all the damage that\nthey could. If matters were allowed to remain as they now were--thus\navoiding the useless sacrifice of men--inevitably the time would come when\nthe food supply the Mercutians had brought with them would be exhausted.\nMeanwhile, if the invaders decided to move in their vehicle to another\nlocation, they could not do so suddenly without abandoning their\napparatus.\n\nAny lessening in the number of light-rays in operation could be taken as\nan indication that a move of this kind was in preparation, and the warning\nwould give General Price time to execute any attack that in the meantime\nmight be planned.\n\nIt was decided then to remain comparatively inactive and await\ndevelopments from the opposite side.\n\nDuring the three months that followed this decision artillery bases were\nlocated at intervals on a circumference of about fifteen miles around the\nMercutian center. These were all on desert country. Lines of communication\nbetween them were established, and the air above was thoroughly patrolled\nnight and day.\n\nThe ten thousand men under General Price it was not thought necessary or\nadvisable to augment. They were deployed around this circumference in\nfront of the artillery, nearer the ten-mile limit. Machine-gun outposts,\nmanned by volunteers exclusively, were established in Garland, Mantua and\nother points within the area controlled by the light. These were for the\npurpose of preventing, or reporting, any possible movements on foot of the\nMercutians.\n\nDuring this time the government was, naturally, subjected to much harsh\ncriticism for its waiting attitude. It was suggested that armored\ntanks--relics of the World War--could be put into commission. These, under\ncover of darkness, could be used to rush the Mercutian position. This\nobviously was an absurd plan, since the light-ray would instantly raise\nthe temperature of the metal composing the car to such a height that the\nmen inside would be killed--not to mention the fact that all explosives\nin the car would be instantly detonated.\n\nAnother suggestion was that a night raid be made upon the outposts of the\ncamp by a few men armed with machine guns fired from the shoulder, in an\neffort to capture one of the Mercutians garbed in a suit impervious to the\nlight. With this suit even one man with a machine gun would probably be\nable to clean out the Mercutian camp.\n\nThis plan evoked much favorable comment. This black material, once in our\npossession, could be analyzed and possibly be duplicated in quantity by\nus. It seemed the logical way of making progress.\n\nBut, unfortunately, conditions around the Mercutian camp at present were\nnot the same as that night when I escaped. At that time it would have been\nfeasible; now it was impossible, for all the invaders were within the\nsmall circle of projectors, and the ground outside this circle was never\nfree from the diverging rays of the light. Also, as one newspaper article\nreplied, even with such a suit of armor a man with a machine gun could do\nlittle, for the light would instantly render useless the gun itself.\n\nSo the controversy went on, and General Price waited, knowing that each\nday must bring the enemy nearer starvation. Such was the condition of\naffairs in the latter part of June.\n\nThen, one morning, I received a telegram from Alan Newland in Florida. I\nhad been corresponding with him at intervals, but he had never given me a\nhint of what had happened down there.\n\nThe telegram read:\n\n    Important Mercutian development here.\n    Keep absolutely secret. Join us here at once.\n    Answer.\n\nI wired him immediately. Three days later I was at Bay Head.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nMIELA'S STORY.\n\n\nWhen I reached the little Florida town Alan was there to meet me. He would\nhave none of my eager questions, but took me at once by launch to their\nbungalow. No one was on the porch when we landed, and we went immediately\ninto the living room. There I found Beth and Professor Newland talking to\nthis extraordinary girl from another world, of whose existence, up to that\nmoment, I had been in complete ignorance. She was dressed especially for\nmy coming, they told me afterward, exactly as she had been that morning\nwhen Alan found her. They wanted to confound me, and they succeeded.\n\nI stood staring in amazement while Beth quietly introduced me. And Miela\nspread her wings, curtsied, and replied in a quaint, soft little voice: \"I\nam honored, sir.\" Then she laughed prettily and, extending her hand,\nadded: \"How do you do, Bob--my friend?\"\n\nWhen I had partially recovered from my astonishment Miela put on the big\nblue-cloth cape she wore constantly to cover her wings. Then Alan and Beth\nplunged into an excited explanation of how he had found Miela, and how all\nthis time she had remained in seclusion with them there studying their\nlanguage.\n\n\"You never have seen such assiduous young people,\" Professor Newland put\nin. \"And certainly she has been a wonderful pupil.\"\n\nHe patted Miela's hand affectionately; but I noticed then that his eyes\nwere very sad, as though from some unvoiced trouble or apprehension.\n\nThey had decided, the professor said, to keep the girl's presence a secret\nfrom the world until they had learned from her in detail what her mission\nwas. The vehicle in which she had come was still on the island up the\nbayou. Alan had stationed there three young men of Bay Head whom he could\ntrust. They were living on the island, guarding it.\n\nDuring these two months while Miela, with uncanny rapidity, was mastering\ntheir language, the Newlands had of course learned from her all she had to\ntell them. The situation in Wyoming did not necessitate haste on their\npart, and so they had waited. And now, with a decision reached, they sent\nfor me.\n\nThat evening after supper we all went out on the bungalow porch, and Miela\ntold me her story. She spoke quietly, with her hands clasped nervously in\nher lap. At times in her narrative her eyes shone with the eager, earnest\nsincerity of her words; at others they grew big and troubled as she spoke\nof the problems that were harassing her world and mine--the inevitable\nself-struggles of humanity, whatever its environment, itself its own worst\nenemy.\n\n\"I am daughter of Lua,\" Miela began slowly, \"of the Great City in the\nCountry of Light. My mother, Lua, is a teacher of the people. My father,\nThaal, died when still I was a child. I--I came to your earth--\"\n\nShe paused and, turning to Beth, added appealingly: \"Oh, there is so\nmuch--to begin--how can I tell--\"\n\n\"Tell him about Tao,\" Beth said.\n\n\"Tao!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"He leads those who came to your earth in the north,\" Miela went on. \"He\nwas my\"--she looked to Alan for the word--\"my suitor there in the Great\nCity. He wished me for his wife--for the mother of his children. But\nthat--that was not what I wished.\"\n\n\"You'd better tell him about conditions in your world first, Miela,\" said\nAlan. He spoke very gently, tenderly.\n\nI had already seen, during supper, how he felt toward her; I could readily\nunderstand it, too, for, next to Beth, she seemed the most adorable woman\nI had ever met. There was nothing unusually strange about her, when her\nwings were covered, except her quaint accent and sometimes curious\ngestures; and no one could be with her long without feeling the sweet\ngentleness of her nature and loving her for it.\n\n\"Tell him about your women,\" Beth added.\n\nI noticed the affectionate regard she also seemed to have for Miela; and I\nnoticed, too, that there was in her face that vague look of sorrow that\nwas in her father's.\n\nThe habitable world of Mercury, Miela then went on to tell me, was divided\ninto three zones--light, twilight and darkness. There was no direct\nsunlight in the Light Country--only a diffused daylight like the light on\nour earth when the sky is clouded over. The people of the Light Country,\nMiela's people, were the most civilized and the ruling race.\n\nIn the twilight zone around them, grading back to the Dark Country,\nvarious other peoples dwelt, and occasionally warred with their neighbors\nfor possession of land in the light.\n\nIn the center of the Light Country, directly underneath the sun--that is,\nwhere the sun, would always appear near the zenith--was the Fire Country.\nHere, owing to violent storms, the atmospheric envelope of the planet was\nfrequently disturbed sufficiently to allow passage for the sun's direct\nrays. Then would ensue in that locality, for a limited time, a heat so\nintense as to destroy life. This Fire Country was practically uninhabited.\n\n\"You see, Bob,\" Alan interrupted, \"the dark part of Mercury--that is the\nside that continually faces away from the sun--is also practically\nuninhabited. Only strange animals and savages live there. And the twilight\nzones, and the ring of Light Country, with the exception of its center,\nare too densely populated. This has caused an immense amount of trouble.\nThe Twilight People are an inferior race. They have tried to mix with\nthose of the Light Country. It doesn't work. There's been trouble for\ngenerations; trouble over the women, for one thing. Anyhow, the Twilight\nPeople have been kept out as much as possible. Now this fellow Tao--\"\n\n\"Let Miela explain about the women first,\" Beth interjected.\n\nThen Miela went on to tell me that only the females of Mercury had\nwings--given them by the Creator as a protection against the pursuit of\nthe male. At marriage, to insure submission to the will of her husband, a\nwoman's wings were clipped. For more than a generation now there had been\na growing rebellion on the part of the women against this practice. In\nthis movement Miela's mother, Lua, was a leader. To overcome this\nmasculine desire for physical superiority and dominance which he had had\nfor centuries seemed practically impossible. Yet, Miela said, the leaders\nof the women now felt that some progress was being made in changing public\nsentiment, although so far not a single man had been found who would take\nfor mate a woman with wings unclipped.\n\nThis was partly from personal pride and partly because the laws of the\ncountry made such a union illegal, its parties moral outlaws, its children\nillegitimate, and thus not entitled to the government benefits bestowed\nupon all offspring of legitimate parentage. It was this man-made law the\nwomen were fighting, and of recent years fighting more and more\nmilitantly.\n\nThis was the situation when Tao suddenly projected himself into public\naffairs as the leader of a new movement. Tao had paid court to Miela\nwithout success. He was active in the fight against the woman movement--a\nbrilliant orator, crafty, unscrupulous, a good leader. Leadership was to\nhim purely a matter of personal gain. He felt no deep, sincere interest in\nany public movement for any other reason.\n\nInterplanetary communication had become of latter years a possibility;\nscience had invented and perfected the means. So far these vehicles had\nonly been used for short trips to the outer edge of the atmosphere of\nMercury--trips that were giving scientific men much valuable knowledge of\natmospheric conditions, and which it was thought would ultimately enable\nthem to counteract the storms and make the Fire Country habitable. No\ntrips into space had been made.\n\nTao now came forward with the proposition to undertake a new world\nconquest--a conquest of Venus or the earth. These planets recently had\nbeen observed from the vehicles. This, he said, would solve the land\nquestion, which, after all, was more serious than the clipping of women's\nwings.\n\nHe found many followers--adventurers, principally, to whom the\npossibilities for untold personal gain in such a conquest appealed. Then\nabruptly the women took part. Dropping for the time their own fight, they\nopposed Tao vigorously. If Venus or the earth were inhabited, as it was\nthought they were, such an expedition would be a war against humanity. It\nwould result in the needless destruction of human life.\n\nIn this controversy the government of the Light Country remained neutral.\nBut the women finally won, and Tao and his followers, a number of them men\nof science, were all banished by the government, under pressure of popular\nsentiment, into the Twilight Country.\n\nHere Tao's project fell upon fertile soil. The Twilight People had every\nreason to undertake such a conquest; and Tao became their leader in\npreparing for it. These preparations were known in the Light Country. The\ngovernment made no effort to prevent them. It was, indeed, rather glad of\nthe possibility of being rid of its disturbing neighbors.\n\nOnly the women were concerned, but they alone could do nothing, since by\nprinciple they were as much opposed to offensive warfare against the\nTwilight People as against the possible inhabitants of the earth. Miela\npaused at this point in her narrative. The thing was getting clearer to me\nnow, but I could not reconcile this feeble attempt to conquer the earth\nwhich we were then fighting in Wyoming with the picture she drew. I said\nso.\n\n\"She hasn't come to that,\" Alan broke in. \"You see, Bob, Tao, with about a\nhundred followers, was banished to the Twilight Country a couple of years\nago. There was plenty of brains in the party, scientific men and such.\nThey had only one vehicle, but they have been at work ever since building\na lot of others.\n\n\"This expedition of Tao to Wyoming--with only about a hundred of the\nTwilight People with him--is not intended to be an offensive operation at\nall. He's only looking the situation over, finding out what they're up\nagainst. They decided before they started that the light-ray would protect\nthem from anything on earth, and they have only come to look around.\n\n\"Right now up there\"--Alan leaned forward earnestly, and in the moonlight\nI could see the flush on his handsome face--\"right now up there in the\nTwilight Country of Mercury they're working their damnedest over all kinds\nof preparations. This Wyoming business this summer does not mean a thing\nTao will quit it any minute. You'll see. Some morning we'll wake up and\nfind them gone. Probably they'll destroy their apparatus, and not bother\nto take it back.\n\n\"And then, in a year or two, they'll be here again. Not one vehicle next\ntime, but a hundred. They'll land all over the earth at once, not on a\ndesert--Tao probably only picked that this time to avoid\ncomplications--but in our big cities, New York, Paris, London, all of them\nat once. That's what we've got to face.\n\n\"If Tao comes back as he plans, we have not got a chance. That's why Miela\nstole this little vehicle and, without it being publicly known in Mercury,\ncame here to warn us. That's what she was after, to help us, risked her\nlife to warn us people of another world.\"\n\nAlan stopped abruptly, and, dropping to the floor of the porch beside\nMiela, laid his arm across her lap, looking up into her face as though she\nwere a goddess. She stroked his hair tenderly, and I could see her eyes\nwere wet with tears.\n\nThere was a moment's silence. I could not have known what Professor\nNewland and Beth were thinking, but a moment later I understood.\n\nThen I realized the sorrow that was oppressing them both.\n\n\"What can be done?\" I asked finally.\n\nAlan jumped to his feet. He began pacing up and down the porch before us;\nevidently he was laboring under a great nervous excitement.\n\n\"There's nothing to be done,\" he said--\"nothing at all--here on earth. We\nhave not got a chance. It's up there the thing has got to be fought\nout--up there on Mercury--to keep them from returning.\"\n\nAlan paused again. When he resumed his voice was pitched lower, but was\nvery tense.\n\n\"I'm going there, Bob--with Miela.\"\n\nI heard Professor Newland's sharply indrawn breath, and saw Beth's dear\nface suddenly whiten.\n\n\"I'm going there to fight it out with them. I may come back; I may not.\nBut if I am successful, _they_ never will--which is all that matters.\n\n\"Miela's mother gave her up to come down here and help us. It is a little\nthing to go back there to help us, also. If I can help her people with\ntheir own problems, so much the better.\"\n\nHe pulled Miela to her feet beside him and put his arm protectingly about\nher shoulders.\n\n\"And Miela is going back to her world as my wife--her body\nunmutilated--the first married woman in Mercury with wings as God gave\nthem to her!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nTO SAVE THE WORLD.\n\n\nTwo days later Alan and Miela were quietly married in Bay Head. She still\nwore the long cloak, and no one could have suspected she was other than a\nbeautiful stranger in the little community. When we got back home Alan\nimmediately made her take off the cloak. He wanted us to admire her\nwings--to note their long, soft red feathers as she extended them, the\nsymbol and the tangible evidence of her freedom from male dominance.\n\nShe was as sweet about it all as she could be, blushing, as though to\nexpose the wings, now that she was married, were immodest. And by the way\nshe regarded Alan, by the gentleness and love in her eyes, I could see she\nwould never be above the guidance, the dominance, of one man, at least.\n\nThe day before their marriage Alan had taken me up the bayou to see the\nlittle silver car in which Miela had come. I was intensely curious to\nlearn the workings of this strange vehicle. As soon as we were inside I\ndemanded that Alan explain it all to me in detail.\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"That's the remarkable part of it, Bob,\" he answered. \"Miela herself\ndidn't thoroughly understand either the basic principle or the mechanism\nitself when she started down here.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! And she ventured--\"\n\n\"Tao was already on the point of leaving when she conceived the idea. He\nhad already made one trip almost to the edge of the earth's atmosphere,\nyou know, and now was ready to start again.\"\n\n\"That first trip was last November,\" I said. \"Tell me about that. What\nwere those first light-meteors for?\"\n\n\"As far as I can gather from what Miela says,\" Alan answered, \"Tao wanted\nto make perfectly sure the light-ray would act in our atmosphere. He\ncame--there were several vehicles they had ready even then--without other\napparatus than those meteors, as we called them. Those he dropped to earth\nwith the light-ray stored in them. They did discharge it properly--they\nseemed effective. The thing was merely a test. Tao was satisfied, and went\nback to arrange for this second preliminary venture in which he is engaged\nnow.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said. \"Go on about Miela.\"\n\n\"Well, she and her mother went before the Scientific Society, she calls\nit--the men who own and control these vehicles in the Light Country. They\ncalled it suicide. No one could be found to come with her. Lua, her\nmother, wanted to, but Miela would not let her take the risk, saying she\nwas needed more there in her own world.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, the thing, while difficult perhaps to understand in\nprinciple, in operation works very simply. Miela knew that, and merely\nasked them to show her how to operate it practically. This they did. She\nspent two days with them--she learns things rather easily, you know--and\nthen she was ready.\"\n\nI waited in amazement.\n\n\"For practical purposes all she had to understand was the operation of\nthese keys. The pressure of the light-ray in these coils\"--he was standing\nbeside a row of wire coils which in the semidarkness I had not noticed\nbefore--\"is controlled by the key-switches.\" He indicated the latter as he\nspoke. \"They send a current to the outer metal plates of the car which\nmakes them repel or attract other masses of matter, as desired.\n\n\"All that Miela had to understand then was how to operate these keys so as\nto keep the base of the vehicle headed toward the earth. They took her to\nthe outer edge of the atmosphere of Mercury over the Dark Country and\nshowed her the earth. They have used terrestrial telescopes for\ngenerations, and since the invention of this vehicle telescopes for\ncelestial observation have been greatly improved.\n\n\"All Miela had to do was keep the air in here purified. That is a simple\nchemical operation. By using this attractive and repellent force she\nallowed the earth's gravity and the repelling power of the sun and Mercury\nto drive her here.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"But, doesn't she--don't you understand the thing in detail?\" I asked\nfinally.\n\n\"I think father and I understand it now better than she does,\" he\nanswered. \"We have studied it out here and questioned her as closely as\npossible. We understand its workings pretty thoroughly. But the exact\nnature of the light-ray we do not understand, any more than we understand\nelectricity. Nor do we understand this metallic substance which when\ncharged with the current becomes attractive or repellent in varying\ndegrees.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"That I can appreciate.\"\n\n\"Father has a theory about the light-ray,\" he went on, \"which seems rather\nreasonable from what we can gather from Miela. The thing seems more like\nelectricity than anything else, and father thinks now that it is generated\nby dynamos on Mercury, similar to those we use here for electricity.\"\n\n\"Along that line,\" I said, \"can you explain why this light-ray, which will\nimmediately set anything on fire that is combustible, and which acts\nthrough metal, like those artillery shells, for instance, does not seem to\nraise the temperature of the ground it strikes to any extent?\"\n\n\"Because, like electricity, it is dissipated the instant it strikes the\nground. The earth is an inexhaustible storehouse and receptacle for such a\nforce. That is why the broken country around the Shoshone River protected\nGarland and Mantua from its direct rays.\"\n\n\"Tell me about the details of this mechanism,\" I said, reverting to our\noriginal subject. \"You say you understand its workings pretty thoroughly\nnow.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" he admitted, \"and so does father. But I cannot go into it now\nwith you. You see,\" he added hastily, as though he feared to hurt my\nfeelings, \"the scientific men of Mercury--some of them--objected to\nMiela's coming, on the ground that the inhabitants of the earth, obtaining\nfrom her a knowledge that would enable them to voyage through space, might\ntake advantage of that knowledge to undertake an invasion of Mercury.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, that was a remote possibility. I could explain to\nyou all I know about this mechanism without much danger of your ever being\nable to build such a car. But Miela promised them that she would use all\npossible precautions, in the event of her having any choice in the matter,\nto prevent the earth people learning anything about it.\n\n\"Father and I have examined everything here closely. But no one else\nhas--and I am sure Miela would prefer no one else did. You understand,\nBob?\"\n\nI did understand; and of course I had to be satisfied with that.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" I said when, later in the day, we were discussing\naffairs in Wyoming, \"that with things in Mercury as we now know they are,\nit would help the situation tremendously if Tao and these Twilight People\nwith him were prevented from ever returning.\"\n\n\"That's my idea exactly,\" Professor Newland agreed.\n\nI could see by the look on his face he was holding on to this thought as a\npossibility that might make Alan's plan unnecessary.\n\n\"I've thought about it constantly,\" the professor said, \"ever since these\nfacts first came to us through Miela. It would be important. With his\nexpedition here a total failure, I think we might assume that nothing more\nwould be done up there in attempting to conquer the earth. I've tried to\nmake Alan see that we should give the authorities all the information we\nhave. It might help--something might be accomplished--\"\n\n\"Nothing would, father,\" Alan interrupted. \"There wouldn't be time. And\neven if this expedition of Tao's were destroyed, I don't see why that's\nany guarantee another attempt would not be made. Miela doesn't, either,\nand she ought to know.\n\n\"Besides, don't you see, Bob\"--he turned to me earnestly--\"I can't have\nthe eyes of the world turned on Miela and her affairs? Why, think of\nit--this little woman sent to Washington, questioned, photographed,\nwritten about, made sport of, perhaps, in the newspapers! And all for\nnothing. It is unthinkable.\"\n\n\"You may be right, my boy,\" said the professor sadly. \"I am giving in to\nyou, but I still--\"\n\n\"The thing has come to me,\" said Alan. \"A duty--a responsibility put\nsquarely up to me. I've accepted it. I'll do my best all the way.\"\n\nA week after Alan and Miela were married the report came that the\nMercutians had suddenly departed, abandoning, after partly destroying,\ntheir apparatus. The world for a few days was in trepidation, fearing a\nreport that they had landed somewhere else, but no such report came.\n\nThree days later Alan and Miela followed them into space.\n\nProfessor Newland, Beth and I went up the bayou with them that morning\nthey left. We were a solemn little party, none of us seemingly wishing to\nvoice the thoughts that possessed us all.\n\nProfessor Newland never spoke once during the trip. When the moment of\nfinal parting came he kissed Miela quietly, and, pressing Alan's hand,\nsaid simply: \"Good luck, my boy. We appreciate what you are doing for us.\nCome back, some day, if you can.\"\n\nThen he faced about abruptly and trudged back to the launch alone, as\npathetic a figure as I have ever seen. We all exchanged our last good-bys,\nlittle Beth in tears clinging to Alan, and then kissing Miela and making\nher promise some day to come back with Alan when he had accomplished his\nmission.\n\nThen they entered the vehicle. Its heavy door closed. A moment later it\nrose silently--slowly at first, then with increasing velocity until we\ncould see it only as a little speck in the air above us. And then it was\ngone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nTHE LANDING ON MERCURY.\n\n\n_(Narrative continued by Alan Newland.)_\n\n\nWith hardly more than a perceptible tremor our strange vehicle came to\nrest upon the surface of Mercury. For a moment Miela and I stood regarding\neach other silently. Then she left her station at the levers of the\nmechanism and placed her hands gently on my shoulders. \"You are welcome,\nmy husband, here to my world.\"\n\nI kissed her glowing, earnest face. We had reached our journey's end. My\nwork was about to begin--upon my own efforts now depended the salvation of\nthat great world I had left behind. What difficulties, what dangers, would\nI have to face, here among the people of this strange planet? I thrilled\nwith awe at the thought of it; and I prayed God then to hold me firm and\nsteadfast to my purpose.\n\nMiela must have divined my thoughts, for she said simply: \"You will have\ngreat power here, Alan; and it is in my heart that you will succeed.\"\n\nWe slid back one of the heavy metallic curtains and looked out through the\nthick glass of the window. It was daylight--a diffused daylight like that\nof a cloudy midday on my own earth. An utterly barren waste met my gaze.\nWe seemed to have landed in a narrow valley. Huge cliffs rose on both\nsides to a height of a thousand feet or more.\n\nThese cliffs, as well as the floor of the valley itself, shone with a\nbrilliant glare, even in the half light of the sunless day. They were not\ncovered with soil, but seemed rather to be almost entirely metallic,\ncopper in color. The whole visible landscape was devoid of any sign of\nvegetation, nor was there a single living thing in sight.\n\nI shuddered at the inhospitable bleakness of it.\n\n\"Where are we, Miela?\"\n\nShe smiled at my tone. It was my first sight of Mercury except vague,\ndistant glimpses of its surface through the mist coming down.\n\n\"You do not like my world?\"\n\nShe was standing close beside me, and at her smiling words raised one of\nher glorious red wings and spread it behind me as though for protection.\nThen, becoming serious once more, she answered my question.\n\n\"We are fortunate, Alan. It is the Valley of the Sun, in the Light\nCountry. I know it well. We are very close to the Great City.\"\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"I'll leave it all to you, little wife. Shall we start at once?\"\n\nHer hand pressed mine.\n\n\"I shall lead you now,\" she said. \"But afterward--_you_ it will be who\nleads _me_--who leads us all.\"\n\nShe crossed to the door fastenings. As she loosed them I remember I heard\na slight hissing sound. Before I could reach her she slid back the door. A\ngreat wave of air rushed in upon us, sweeping us back against the wall. I\nclutched at something for support, but the sweep of wind stopped almost at\nonce.\n\nI had stumbled to my knees. \"Miela!\" I cried in terror.\n\nShe was beside me in an instant, wide-eyed with fear, which even then I\ncould see was fear only for me.\n\nI struggled to my feet. My head was roaring. All the blood in my body\nseemed rushing to my face.\n\nAfter a moment I felt better. Miela pulled me to a seat.\n\n\"I did not think, Alan. The pressure of the air is different here from\nyour world. It was so wrong of me, for I knew. It was so when I landed\nthere on your earth.\"\n\nI had never thought to ask her that, nor had she ever spoken of it to me.\nShe went on now to tell me how, when first she had opened the door on that\nlittle Florida island, all the air about her seemed rushing away. She had\nfelt then as one feels transported quickly to the rarified atmosphere of a\ngreat height.\n\nHere the reverse had occurred. We had brought with us, and maintained, an\nair density such as that near sea level on earth. But here on Mercury the\nair was far denser, and its pressure had rushed in upon us instantly the\ndoor was opened. Miela had been affected to a much less extent than I, and\nin consequence recovered far more quickly.\n\nThe feeling, after the first nausea, the pressure and pain in my ears and\nthe roaring in my head, had passed away. A sense of heaviness, an\ninability to breathe with accustomed freedom, remained with me for days.\n\nWe sat quiet for some minutes, and then left the vehicle. Miela was\ndressed now as I had first seen her on the Florida bayou. As we stepped\nupon the ground she suddenly tore the veil from her breast, spread her\nwings, and, with a laugh of sheer delight, flew rapidly up into the air. I\nstood watching her, my heart beating fast. Up--up she went into the gray\nhaze of the sky. Then I could see her spread her great wings, motionless,\na giant bird soaring over the valley.\n\nA few moments more, and she was again beside me, alighting on the tip of\none toe with perfect poise and grace almost within reach of my hand.\n\nI do not quite know what feelings possessed me at that moment. Perhaps it\nwas a sense of loss as I saw this woman I loved fly away into the air\nwhile I remained chained to the ground. I cannot tell. But when she came\nback, dropping gently down beside me, ethereal and beautiful as an angel\nfrom heaven itself, a sudden rush of love swept over me.\n\nI crushed her to me, glorying in the strength of my arms and the frailness\nof her tender little body.\n\nWhen I released her she looked up into my eyes archly.\n\n\"You do not like me to fly? Your wife is free--and, oh, Alan, it is so\ngood--so good to be back here again where I _can_ fly.\"\n\nShe laughed at my expression.\n\n\"You are a man, too--like all the men of my world. That is the feeling you\ncame here to conquer, Alan--so that the women here may all keep their\nwings--and be free.\"\n\nI think I was just a little ashamed of myself for a moment. But I knew my\nfeeling had been only human. I _did_ want her to fly, to keep those\nbeautiful wings. And in that moment they came to represent not only her\nfreedom, but my trust in her, my very love itself.\n\nI stroked their sleek red feathers gently with my hand.\n\n\"I shall never feel that way again, Miela,\" I said earnestly.\n\nShe laughed once more and kissed me, and the look in her eyes told me she\nunderstood.\n\nThe landscape, from this wider viewpoint, seemed even more bleak and\ndesolate than before. The valley was perhaps half a mile broad, and wound\naway upward into a bald range of mountains in the distance.\n\nThe ground under my feet was like a richly metallic ore. In places it was\nwholly metal, smooth and shining like burnished copper. Below us the\nvalley broadened slightly, falling into what I judged must be open country\nwhere lay the city of our destination.\n\nFor some minutes I stood appalled at the scene. I had often been in the\ndeserts of America, but never have I felt so great a sense of desolation.\nAlways before it had been the lack of water that made the land so arid;\nand always the scene seemed to hold promise of latent fertility, as though\nonly moisture were needed to make it spring into fruition.\n\nNothing of the kind was evident here. There was, indeed, no lack of water.\nI could see a storm cloud gathering in the distance. The air I was\nbreathing seemed unwarrantably moist; and all about me on the ground\nlittle pools remained from the last rainfall. But here there was no soil,\nnot so much even as a grain of sand seemed to exist. The air was warm, as\nwarm as a midsummer's day in my own land, a peculiarly oppressive, moist\nheat.\n\nI had been prepared for this by Miela. I was bareheaded, since there never\nwas to be direct sunlight. My feet were clad in low shoes with rubber\nsoles. I wore socks. For the rest, I had on simply one of my old pairs of\nshort, white running pants and a sleeveless running shirt. With the\nexception of the shoes it was exactly the costume I had worn in the races\nat college.\n\nI had been standing motionless, hardly more than a step from the car in\nwhich we had landed. Suddenly, in the midst of my meditations on the\nstrange scene about me, Miela said: \"Go there, Alan.\"\n\nShe was smiling and pointing to a little rise of ground near by. I looked\nat her blankly.\n\n\"Jump, Alan,\" she added.\n\nThe spot to which she pointed was perhaps forty feet away. I knew what she\nmeant, and, stepping back a few paces, came running forward and leaped\ninto the air. I cleared the intervening space with no more effort than I\ncould have jumped less than half that distance on earth.\n\nMiela flew over beside me.\n\n\"You see, Alan, my husband, it is not so bad, perhaps, that I can fly.\"\n\nShe was smiling whimsically, but I could see her eyes were full of pride.\n\n\"There is no other man on Mercury who could do that, Alan,\" she added.\n\nI tried successive leaps then, always with the same result. I calculated\nthat here the pull of gravity must be something less than one-half that on\nthe earth. It was far more than father had believed.\n\nMiela watched my antics, laughing and clapping her hands with delight. I\nfound I tired very quickly--that is, I was winded. This I attributed to\nthe greater density of the air I was breathing.\n\nIn five minutes I was back at Miela's side, panting heavily.\n\n\"If I can--ever get so I breathe right--\" I said.\n\nShe nodded. \"A very little time, I think.\"\n\nI sat down for a moment to recover my breath. Miela explained then that we\nwere some ten miles from the fertile country surrounding the city in which\nher mother lived, and about fifteen miles from the outskirts of the city\nitself. I give these distances as they would be measured on earth. We\ndecided to start at once. We took nothing with us. The journey would be a\nshort one, and we could easily return at some future time for what we had\nleft behind. We needed no food for so short a trip, and plenty of water\nwas at hand.\n\nOnly one thing Miela would not part with--the single memento she had\nbrought from earth to her mother. She refused to let me touch it, but\ninsisted on carrying it herself, guarding it jealously.\n\nIt was Beth's little ivory hand mirror!\n\nWe started off. Miela had wound the filmy scarf about her shoulders again\nwith a pretty little gesture.\n\n\"I need not use wings, Alan, when I am with you. We shall go together, you\nand I--on the ground.\"\n\nAnd then, as I started off vigorously, she added plaintively from behind\nme: \"If--if you will go slow, my husband, or will wait for me.\"\n\nI altered my pace to suit hers. I had quite recovered my breath now, and\nfor the moment felt that I could carry her much faster than she could\nwalk. I did gather her into my arms once, and ran forward briskly, while\nshe laughed and struggled with me to be put down. She seemed no more than\na little child in my arms; but, as before, the heavy air so oppressed me\nthat in a few moments I was glad enough to set her again upon her feet.\n\nThe valley broadened steadily as we advanced. For several miles the look\nof the ground remained unchanged. I wondered what curious sort of metal\nthis might be--so like copper in appearance. I doubted if it were copper,\nsince even in this hot, moist air it seemed to have no property of\noxidation.\n\nI asked Miela about it, and she gave me its Mercutian name at once; but of\ncourse that helped me not a bit. She added that outcroppings of it, almost\nin the pure state, like the great deposits of native copper I had seen on\nearth, occurred in many parts of Mercury.\n\nI remembered then Bob Trevor's mention of it as the metal of the apparatus\nused by the invaders of Wyoming.\n\nWe went on three or four miles without encountering a single sign of life.\nNo insects stirred underfoot; no birds flew overhead. We might have\nbeen--by the look of it--alone on a dead planet.\n\n\"Is none of your mountain country inhabited, Miela?\" I asked.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Only on the plains do people live. There is very little of good land in\nthe Light Country, and so many people. That it is which has caused much\ntrouble in the past. It is for that, many times, the Twilight People have\nmade war upon us.\"\n\nI found myself constantly able to breathe more easily. Our progress down\nthe valley seemed now irritatingly slow, for I felt I could walk or run\nthree times faster than Miela. Finally I suggested to her that she fly,\nkeeping near me; and that I would make the best speed forward I could. She\nstared at me quizzically. Then, seeing I was quite sincere, she flung her\nlittle arms up about my neck and pulled me down to kiss her.\n\n\"Oh, Alan--the very best husband in all the universe, you are. None other\ncould there be--like you.\"\n\nShe had just taken off her scarf again when suddenly I noticed a little\nspeck in the sky ahead. It might have been a tiny bird, flying toward us\nfrom the plains below.\n\n\"Miela--look!\"\n\nShe followed the direction of my hand. The speck grew rapidly larger.\n\n\"A girl, Alan,\" she said after a moment. \"Let us wait.\"\n\nWe stood silent, watching. It was indeed a girl, flying over the valley\nsome two or three hundred feet above the ground. As she came closer I saw\nher wings were blue, not red like Miela's. She came directly toward us.\n\nSuddenly Miela gave a little cry.\n\n\"Anina! Anina!\"\n\nWithout a word to me she spread her wings and flew up to meet the oncoming\ngirl.\n\nI stood in awe as I watched them. They met almost above me, and I could\nsee them hovering with clasped hands while they touched cheeks in\naffectionate greeting. Then, releasing each other, they flew rapidly away\ntogether--smaller and smaller, until a turn in the valley hid them\nentirely from my sight.\n\nI sat down abruptly. A lump was in my throat, a dismal lonesomeness in my\nheart. I knew Miela would return in a moment--that she had met some friend\nor relative--yet I could not suppress the vague feeling of sorrow and the\nknowledge of my own incapacity that swept over me.\n\nFor the first time then I wanted wings--wanted them myself--that I might\njoin this wife I loved in her glorious freedom of the air. And I realized,\ntoo, for the first time, how that condition Miela so deplored on Mercury\nhad come to pass. I could understand now very easily how it was that\nmarried women were deprived by their husbands of these wings which they\nthemselves were denied by the Creator.\n\nHardly more than ten minutes had passed before I saw the two girls again\nflying toward me. They alighted a short distance away, and approached me,\nhand in hand.\n\nThe girl with Miela, I could see now, was somewhat shorter, even slighter\nof build, and two or three years younger. Her face held the same delicate,\nwistful beauty. The two girls strongly resembled one another in feature.\nThe newcomer was dressed in similar fashion to Miela--sandals on her feet,\nand silken trousers of a silvery white, fastened at the ankles with golden\ncords.\n\nHer wings, as I have said, were blue--a delight light blue that, as I\nafterward noticed, matched her eyes. Her hair was the color of spun gold;\nshe wore it in two long, thick braids over her shoulders and fastened at\nthe waist and knee. She was, in very truth, the most ethereal human being\nI had ever beheld. And--next to Miela--the most beautiful.\n\nMiela pulled her forward, and she came on, blushing with the sweet shyness\nof a child. She was winding her silken silver scarf about her breast\nhastily, as best she could with her free hand.\n\n\"My sister, Anina--Alan,\" said Miela simply.\n\nThe girl stood undecided; then, evidently obeying Miela's swift words of\ninstruction, she stood up on tiptoe, put her arms about my neck, and\nkissed me full on the lips.\n\nMiela laughed gayly.\n\n\"You must love her very much, Alan. And she--your little sister--will love\nyou, too. She is very sweet.\"\n\nThen her face sobered suddenly.\n\n\"Tao has returned, Alan. And he has sent messengers to our city. They are\nappealing to our people to join Tao in his great conquest. They say Tao\nhas here with him, on Mercury, a captive earthman, with wonderful strength\nof body, who will help in the destruction of his own world!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nTHE CAPTIVE EARTH-MAN.\n\n\nAs we came out of the valley I had my first view of the Great City. It\noccupied a huge, mound-shaped circular mountain which rose alone out of\nthe wide plain that spread before me. As far as I could see extended a\nrich muddy soil partially covered with water. A road led out of the\nvalley, stretching across these wet fields toward the base of the\nmountain. It was built on an embankment some eight or ten feet high, of\nthe red, metallic ore of the mountains.\n\nAll along the base of this embankment, with their roots in the water,\ngraceful trees like palms curved upward over the road. The landscape was\ndotted with these and other tropical trees; the scene was, indeed,\nessentially tropical.\n\nI wondered at the continued absence of sight of human beings. The fields\nwere quite evidently under cultivation. A rise of ground off to the left\nwas ridged with terraces. As we passed on along the road I saw a rude form\nof plow standing where it had been left in a field which evidently was\nproducing rice or something akin to it. Yet there was not a person in\nsight. Only ahead in the sky I could see a little cluster of black dots\nthat Miela said was a group of females hovering about the summit of the\nGreat City.\n\n\"It is the time of sleep now, Alan,\" she said, in answer to my question.\n\nI had not thought of that. It was broad daylight, but here on Mercury\nthere was no day or night, but always the same half light, as of a cloudy\nday.\n\nThe mountain on which the city was built was dotted thickly with palms,\nand as we approached I made out the houses of the city, set amid the\ntrees, with broad streets converging at the top. As we came still closer I\nsaw that the summit of the mountain was laid out like some beautiful\ntropical garden, with a broad, low-lying palace in its center.\n\nWhen we were still a mile or so away from the outskirts of the city Miela\nspoke in her soft native tongue to Anina. The girl smiled at me in\nparting, and, unwinding the veil from about her breast, flew into the air.\n\nWe stood watching her as she winged her way onward toward the sleeping\ncity. When she had dwindled to a tiny speck I sighed unconsciously and\nturned away; and again Miela smiled at me with comprehension.\n\nWe started forward, Miela chattering now like a little child. She seemed\neager to tell me all about the new world of hers I was entering, and there\nwas indeed so much to tell she was often at a loss what to describe first.\n\nShe named the cereal which constituted the only crop to which these marsh\nlands were suitable. From her description I made out it was similar to\nrice, only of a somewhat larger grain. It formed, she said, the staple\narticle of food of the nation.\n\nAs we approached the base of the Great City mountain the ground began\ngradually rising. The drainage thus afforded made it constantly drier as\nwe advanced. It assumed now more the character of a heavy loam.\n\nStill farther on we began passing occasional houses--the outskirts of the\ncity itself. They were square, single-story, ugly little buildings, built\nof reddish stone and clay, flat-roofed, and raised a foot or two off the\nground on stone pilings. They had large rectangular windows, most of them\nopen, a few with lattice shades. The doorways stood open without sign of a\ndoor; access to the ground was obtained by a narrow board incline.\n\nInterspersed with these stone houses I saw many single-room shacks,\nloosely built of narrow boards from the palm trees, and thatched with\nstraw. In these, Miela explained, lived poorer people, who worked in the\nrice fields for the small land owners.\n\nWe reached the base of the mountain proper, and I found myself in a broad\nstreet with houses on both sides. This street seemed to run directly to\nthe summit of the mountain, sloping upward at a sharp angle. We turned\ninto it and began our climb into the sleeping city. It was laid out\nregularly, all its principal streets running from the base of the mountain\nupward to its summit, where they converged in a large open space in which\nthe castle I have already mentioned was situated. The cross-streets formed\nconcentric rings about the mountain, at intervals of perhaps five hundred\nfeet down its sides--small circles near the top, lengthening until at the\nbase the distance around was, I should judge, ten miles or more.\n\nWe climbed upward nearly to the summit; then Miela turned into one of the\ncross-streets. I had found the climb tremendously tiring, though Miela\nseemed not to notice it unduly, and I was glad enough when we reached this\nstreet which girdled the mountain almost at the same level. We had gone\nonly a short distance along it, however, when Miela paused before a house\nset somewhat back from the road on a terrace.\n\n\"My home,\" she said, and her voice trembled a little with emotion. \"_Our_\nhome it shall be now, Alan, with Lua and Anina, our mother and sister.\"\n\nA low, bushy hedge separated the street from a garden that surrounded the\nhouse. The building was of stone, two stories in height. It was covered\nwith a thick vine bearing a profusion of vivid red flowers. On its flat\nroof were tiny palm trees, a pergola with trellised vines, and still more\nflowers, most of them of the same brilliant red. The whole was surrounded\nby a waist-high parapet.\n\nOne corner of the roof was covered with thatch--a little nest where one\nmight be sheltered from the rain, and in which I could see a bed of palm\nfiber. At one side of the house a tremendous cluster of bamboo curved\nupward and over the roof. A path of chopped coconut husks led from the\nstreet to a short flight of steps in the terrace at the front entrance.\n\nWe passed along this path and entered through the open doorway directly\ninto what I judged was the living room of the dwelling. It was some thirty\nfeet long and half as broad, with a high ceiling and stone floor. Its\nthree windows fronted the garden we had just left; in its farther wall a\nlow archway led into an adjoining room. The furniture consisted only of\ntwo or three small tables and several low, wide couches, all of bamboo.\n\nA woman and the girl Anina rose as we entered. Anina ran toward us\neagerly; the elder woman stood, quietly waiting. She was about forty years\nof age, as tall as Miela, but heavier of build. She was dressed in loose\nsilk trousers, gathered at waist and ankle; and a wide sash that covered\nher breast. Her hair was iron gray, cut short at the base of the neck.\nFrom her shoulders I saw hanging a cloak that entirely covered her wings.\n\nAs she turned toward us I saw a serious, dignified, wholly patrician face,\nwith large, kindly dark eyes, a high, intellectual forehead, and a firm\nyet sensitive mouth. She was the type of woman one would instinctively\nmark for leader.\n\nMiela ran forward to greet her mother, falling upon her knees and touching\nher forehead to the elder woman's sandaled feet. As she rose I could see\nthere were tears in the eyes of them both. Then Miela presented me. I\nstood for an instant, confused, not knowing quite what I should do.\n\nMiela laughed her gay little laugh.\n\n\"Bow low, Alan--as I did--to our mother.\"\n\nI knelt to her respectfully, and she put her hands lightly upon my head,\nspeaking low words of greeting. Then, as I stood up again, I met her eyes\nand smiled an answer to the gentle smile on her lips. From that moment I\nfelt almost as though she were my own mother, and I am sure she took me\nthen into her heart as her son.\n\nThe introduction over, I turned toward one of the windows, leaving Miela\nto talk with her mother. Anina followed me, standing timidly by my side,\nwith her big, curious eyes looking up into my face.\n\n\"You're a sweet, dear little sister,\" I said, \"and I _am_ going to love\nyou very much.\"\n\nI put my arm about her shoulders, and she smiled as though she understood\nme, yielding to my embrace with the ready friendship of a child. For some\nmoments we stood together, looking out of the window and talking to each\nother with words that were quite unintelligible to us both. Then Miela\nsuddenly called me.\n\n\"We shall eat now, Alan,\" she said, \"for you are hungry, I know. And above\nthere is water, that we may wash.\" Her face clouded as she went on: \"Our\nmother has told me a little that has happened. It is very serious, Alan,\nas you shall hear. Tao, with his great news of your wonderful world, is\nvery fast winning over our men to his cause. A revolt, there may be, here\nin our own city--a revolution against our government, our king. We can\nonly look to you now, my husband, to save our country from Tao as well as\nyour own.\"\n\nThe situation as I found it in the Light Country was, as Miela said,\nalarmingly serious. During the two years Tao had been in the Twilight\nCountry, preparing for his attack upon the earth, his project had caused\nlittle stir among the Light Country people.\n\nIts women were, at first, perturbed at this wanton attack upon the\nhumanity of another world, but since the earth was such an unknown\nquantity, and the fact of its being inhabited at all was problematical,\ninterest in the affair soon lagged. The government of the Light Country\nconcerned itself not at all.\n\nBut now, upon Tao's return, the news of his venture, as told by the\nemissaries he sent to the Light Country, struck its people like a\nbombshell. These emissaries--all men--had come to the Great City, and,\nfinding their presence tolerated by the authorities, had immediately\nstarted haranguing the people.\n\nThe men were inclined to listen, and many of them openly declared their\nsympathy with Tao. These, however, were for the most part of the poorer,\nmore ignorant classes, or those more adventurous, less scrupulous\nindividuals to whom the prospect of sudden riches appealed.\n\n\"Why doesn't your government just throw Tao's men out if they're causing\nso much trouble?\" I asked. \"They never should have been allowed in the\ncountry at all.\"\n\nMiela smiled sadly.\n\n\"That is so, my husband. That should have been done; but now it is too\nlate. Our men would protect them now, declaring their right to stay here\nand speak. There might be bloodshed among our people, and that must not\nbe.\"\n\n\"Are they armed?\" I asked.\n\nShe shook her head. \"No one is armed with the light-ray. To carry it is a\ncrime punishable by death, for the light is too destructive.\"\n\n\"But Tao has it?\"\n\n\"Tao has it, indeed, but he is not so great a monster that he would use it\nagainst us.\"\n\nI was not so sure of that, and I said so. \"You don't mean to tell me,\nMiela, that your government has allowed Tao to prepare all this\ndestructive armament without itself arming?\"\n\nAgain she shook her head. \"We have been preparing, too, and all our young\nmen can be called if occasion comes. But that must never be. It would be\ntoo terrible.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiela and I occupied, that first night on Mercury, a broad wooden bed\nbuilt low to the floor, with a mattress of palm fiber. At first I could\nnot sleep, but lay thinking over the many things she had told me. The\nlight in the room, too, was strange. Lattice covered the windows, but it\nwas like trying to sleep at midday; and the heat and heaviness of the air\noppressed me. I dropped off finally, to be awakened by Miela's voice\ncalling me to breakfast.\n\nWe sat down to the morning meal at a low table set with shining plates and\ngoblets of copper, or whatever the metal was, and napery of silk. The rice\nformed our main article of food, with sugar, milk, and a beverage not\nunlike coffee. There was also a meat like beef, although more highly\nflavored, and a number of sickish sweet fruits of a kind entirely new to\nme, which I could do no more than taste.\n\nWe were served by a little maid whose darker skin and heavier features\nproclaimed her of another race--a native of the Fire Country, Miela told\nme. She was dressed in a brown tunic of heavy silk, reaching from waist to\nknee. Her thick black hair was cut to her shoulders.\n\nOn her left arm above the elbow was welded a broad band of copper\ninscribed with a mark to identify Lua as her owner, for she was a slave.\nHer torso was bare, except for a cloak like Lua's which hung from her\nshoulders in the back to cover her wings. By this I knew she could not\nfly.\n\nIt was not until some time afterward that I learned the reason for this\ncovering of the clipped wings. The wing joints were severed just above the\nwaist line. The feathers on the remaining upper portions were clipped, but\nthrough disuse these feathers gradually dropped out entirely.\n\nThe flesh and muscle underneath was repulsive in appearance--for which\nreason it was always kept covered. Lua showed me her wings once--mere\nshrunken stumps of what had once been her most glorious possession. I did\nnot wonder then that the women were ready to fight, almost, rather than\npart with them.\n\nDifficulties of language made our conversation during the meal somewhat\nhalting, although Miela acted as interpreter. Lua and Anina both expressed\ntheir immediate determination to learn English, and, with the same\npersistence that Miela had shown, they set aside nearly everything else to\naccomplish it.\n\nWe decided that we should see the king and arrange our future course of\naction. Whatever was to be done should be done at once--that we all\nagreed--for Tao's men were steadily gaining favor with a portion of the\npeople, and we had no means of knowing what they would attempt to do.\n\n\"What will your people think of me?\" I suddenly asked Miela.\n\n\"We have sent our king word that you are here,\" she answered, \"and we have\nasked that he send a guard to take you to the castle this morning.\"\n\n\"A guard?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"It is better that the people see you first as a man of\nimportance. You will go to the king under guard. Few will notice you. Then\nwill he, our ruler, arrange that you are shown to the people as a great\nman--one who has come here to help us--one who is trusted and respected by\nour king. You see, my husband, the difference?\"\n\nI did, indeed, though I wondered a little how I should justify this\nexalted position which was being thrust upon me. After breakfast Lua and\nAnina busied themselves about the house, while Miela and I went to the\nrooftop to wait for the king's summons. From here I had my first really\ngood view of the city at close range.\n\nMiela's home sat upon a terrace, leveled off on the steep hillside; all\nthe houses in the vicinity were similarly situated. Behind us the mountain\nrose steeply; in front it dropped away, affording an extended view of the\nlevel, palm-dotted country below.\n\nThe slope of hillside rising abruptly behind us held another house just\nabove the level of the rooftop we were on. As I sat there looking idly\nabout I thought I saw a figure lurking near this higher building. I called\nMiela's attention to it--the obscure figure of a man standing against a\nhuge palm trunk.\n\nAs we watched the figure stepped into plainer view. I saw then it _was_ a\nman, evidently looking down at us. I stood up. There was no one else in\nsight except a woman on the roof of the other house holding an infant.\n\nSomething about the man's figure seemed vaguely familiar; my heart leaped\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Miela,\" I whispered, \"surely that--that is no one of your world.\"\n\nHer hand clutched my arm tightly as the man stepped forward again and\nwaved at us. I crossed the rooftop, Miela following. At my sudden motion\nthe man hesitated, then seemed about to run. I hardly know what thoughts\nimpelled me, but suddenly I shouted: \"Wait!\"\n\nAt the sound of my voice he whirled around, stopped dead an instant, and\nthen, with an answering call, came running down the hillside.\n\n\"The earth-man!\" cried Miela. \"The earth-man of Tao it must be.\"\n\nWe hurried down through the house and arrived at its back entrance. Coming\ntoward us at a run across the garden was the man--unmistakably one of my\nown world.\n\nMy hurried glance showed me he was younger than I--a short, stocky,\nred-headed chap, dressed in dirty white duck trousers and a torn white\nlinen shirt.\n\nHe came on at full speed.\n\n\"Hello!\" I called.\n\nHe stopped abruptly. For an instant we stared at each other; then he\ngrinned broadly.\n\n\"Well, I don't know who _you_ are,\" he ejaculated, \"but I want to say it\ncertainly does me good to see you.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nTHE RULER OF THE LIGHT COUNTRY.\n\n\nHowever pleased the newcomer was to see me, I had no difficulty in\nassuring him with equal truth that my feelings matched his. The first\nsurprise of the meeting over, we took him to the living room, where Lua\ngreeted him with dignified courtesy, and we all gathered around to hear\nhis story.\n\nHe was, I saw now, not more than twenty years old, rather short--perhaps\nfive feet six or seven inches--and powerfully built, with a shock of\ntousled red hair and a handsome, rough-hewn face essentially masculine.\n\nHe seemed to be an extraordinarily good-humored chap, with the ready wit\nof an Irishman. I liked him at once--I think we all did.\n\nHe began, characteristically, near the end rather than the beginning of\nthe events I knew he must have to tell us.\n\n\"I got away,\" he chuckled, grinning more broadly than ever. \"But where I\nwas going to, search me. And who the deuce are _you_, if you don't mind my\nasking? How did you ever get to this God-forsaken place?\"\n\nI smiled. \"You tell us about yourself first; then I'll tell you about\nmyself. You are the earth-man we've been hearing about, aren't you--the\nman Tao captured in Wyoming and brought here with him?\"\n\n\"They caught me in Wyoming all right. Who's Tao?\"\n\n\"He's the leader of them all.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, they brought me here, as you say, and I guess they've had me\nabout all over this little earth since. They stuck me in a boat, and Lord\nknows how far we went. We got here last night, and when my guard went to\nsleep I beat it.\" He scratched his head lugubriously. \"Though what good I\nthought it was going to do me I don't know. That's about all, I guess.\nWho the deuce are you?\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"Wait a minute--don't go so fast. Start at the beginning. What's your\nname?\"\n\n\"Oliver Mercer.\"\n\nHis face grew suddenly grave. \"My brother was killed up there in\nWyoming--that's how I happened to go there in the first place.\"\n\n\"Mercer!\" I exclaimed.\n\nHe started. \"Yes--why? You don't think you know me, by any chance, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, but I knew your brother--that is, I know Bob Trevor, who was with him\nwhen he was killed. He's one of my best friends.\"\n\nThe young fellow extended his hand. \"A friend of Bob Trevor's--away off\nhere! Don't it get you, just?\"\n\nMiela interrupted us here to translate to her mother and Anina what he\nsaid.\n\nMercer went on: \"The assumption is, you people here are not working with\nthis gang of crooks I got away from--this Tao? Am I right in thinking so?\"\n\n\"You're certainly right, that far,\" I laughed.\n\nI felt, more than I can say, a great sense of relief, a lessening of the\ntension, the unconscious strain I had been under, at this swift, jovial\nconversation with another human of my own kind.\n\n\"Yes, you're right on that. This Tao and I are not exactly on the same\nside. I'll tell you all about it in a minute.\"\n\n\"Then, we're working together?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, all I'm working for is to get back home where I came from.\"\n\n\"You won't be when you hear all I've got to say.\"\n\nHe started at that; then, with sudden change of thought, his eyes turned\nto Anina. The girl blushed under his admiring gaze.\n\n\"Say, she's a little beauty, isn't she? Who is she?\"\n\n\"She's my sister,\" I said, smiling.\n\nFor once he was too dumfounded to reply.\n\nMiela had finished her translation now, and, as she turned back to us,\nspoke in English for the first time during the conversation.\n\n\"Do you know why it is they brought you here from the Twilight Country?\"\nshe asked Mercer.\n\nThis gave him another shock. \"Why, I--no. That is--say, how do you happen\nto talk English? Is it one of your languages here, by any chance?\"\n\nMiela laughed gayly.\n\n\"Only we three, in all this world, speak English. I know it because--\"\n\nI interrupted her.\n\n\"Suppose I tell him our whole story, Miela? Then--\"\n\n\"That's certainly what I want to hear,\" said Mercer emphatically. \"And\nespecially why it is that I'm not supposed to want to get back to where I\nbelong.\"\n\nMy explanation must have lasted nearly an hour, punctuated by many\nquestions and exclamations of wonder from young Mercer. I told him the\nwhole affair in detail, and ended with a statement of exactly how matters\nstood now on Mercury.\n\n\"Do you want to hurry back home to earth now?\" I finished.\n\n\"Duck out of this? I should say not. Why, we've got a million things to do\nhere.\"\n\nHis eyes turned again toward Anina.\n\n\"And, say--about letting those girls keep their wings. I'm strong for\nthat. Let's be sure and fix that up before we leave.\"\n\nIt was not more than half an hour later when the king's guards arrived to\nconduct us to the castle. Meanwhile young Mercer had discovered he was\nhungry and thirsty. As soon as he had finished eating we started off--he\nand I, with Lua and Miela. The guards led us away as though we were\nprisoners, forming a hollow square--there were some thirty of them--with\nus in the center. We attracted little attention from passersby; the few\nwho stopped to stare at us, or who attempted to follow, were briskly\nordered away.\n\nOccasionally a few girls would hover overhead, but when the guards shouted\nup at them they flew away obediently.\n\nThe king's castle was constructed of metal and stone--a long, low,\nrambling structure, flanked by two spires or minarets, giving it somewhat\nan Oriental appearance. Each of these minarets was girdled, halfway up, by\na narrow balcony.\n\nThe first room into which we passed was small, seemingly an antechamber.\nFrom it, announced by two other guards who stood at the entrance, we\nentered directly into the main hall of the building. At one end of it\nthere was a raised platform. On this, seated about a large table, were\nsome ten or twelve dignitaries--the king's advisers. They were, I saw, all\naged men, with beardless, seamed faces, long snowy-white hair to their\nshoulders, and dressed in flowing silk robes.\n\nThe king was a man of seventy-odd, kindly faced, gentle in demeanor. He\nbore himself with the dignity of a born ruler, and yet his very kindliness\nof aspect and the doddering gravity of his aged councilors, seemed to\nexplain at once most of the trouble that now confronted him.\n\nWe stood beside this table--they courteously made way for Lua to sit among\nthem--and all its occupants immediately turned to face us.\n\nOur audience lasted perhaps an hour and a half altogether. I need not go\ninto details. I was right in assuming that the king desired to help us\nprevent Tao from his attempted conquest of the earth. This was so, but\nonly in so far as his actions would not jeopardize the peace of his own\nnation. He sadly admitted his error in allowing Tao's emissaries into the\nLight Country. But now they were there, he did not see how to get them\nout.\n\nHis people were daily listening to them more eagerly; and, what was worse,\nthe police guards themselves seemed rather more in sympathy with them than\notherwise. A slight disturbance had occurred in the streets the day\nbefore, and the guards had stood apathetically by, taking no part. Above\nall else, the king stoutly protested, he would have no bloodshed in his\ncountry if he could prevent it.\n\nIn the neighboring towns of the Light Country--the nearest of which was\nsome forty miles away from the Great City--the situation was almost the\nsame. Reports brought by young women flying between the cities said that\nto many Tao also had sent emissaries who were fast winning converts to his\ncause.\n\n\"Do all these people who believe in Tao expect to go to our earth when it\nis conquered?\" I asked Miela. \"How can they--so many of them--hope to\nbenefit in that way? Aren't they satisfied here?\"\n\nMiela smiled sadly.\n\n\"No people can ever be satisfied--all of them. That you must know, my\nhusband. They have many grievances against our ruler. Many things they\nwant which he cannot give. Tao may promise these things--and if they\nbelieve his promise it is very bad.\"\n\n\"He might come over here and try to make himself king,\" Mercer said\nsuddenly. \"If it's like that maybe he could do it, too, with this grand\nearth-conquest getting ready. Tell the king that--see what he says.\"\n\n\"He says that he realizes and fears it,\" Miela answered. \"But he thinks\nthat first Tao will go to your earth, and he may never come back. So much\nmay happen--\"\n\n\"So he's just going to wait,\" I explained. \"Well, _we're_ not just going\nto wait. Ask the king what our status is.\"\n\n\"Ask him about me,\" Mercer put in. \"Are those Tao men going to grab me the\nminute I show my face on the street, or will he protect me?\"\n\nMiela translated this to the king, adding something of her own to which he\nevidently agreed.\n\n\"It is as I thought,\" she said. \"He believes he can present you to the\npeople as men of earth who are our guests, and that they will accept you\nin friendly spirit, most of them.\"\n\nThe king spoke to one of his advisers, who abruptly left the room.\n\n\"He will call the people now,\" Miela went on, \"and will speak to them from\nthe tower--all who can leave their tasks to come. You will stand there\nwith him. He will ask that we of the Light Country allow you to remain\nhere in peace among us. And this captive earth man of Tao's\"--she laid her\nhand lightly on Mercer's shoulder--\"he will ask, too, that he be given\nsanctuary among us. Our people still are kindly--most of them--and they\nwill see the justice of what he asks.\"\n\nI suggested then that Miela tell the king that we had determined, if we\ncould, to frustrate Tao in his plans; and showed her how to point out to\nhim that such an outcome would, if successful, make his throne secure and\ninsure peace for his nation.\n\nHe asked me bluntly what it was I thought I could do. The vague beginnings\nof a plan were forming in my mind. \"Tell him, Miela, I think we can rid\nthe Light Country of Tao's emissaries--send them back--without causing any\ndisturbances among the people. Ask him if that would not be a good thing.\"\n\nThe king nodded gravely as this was translated.\n\n\"He asks you how?\" Miela said next.\n\n\"Tell him, Miela, that there are some things that might happen of which he\nwould be very glad, but which it might be better he did not know. You\nunderstand. Make him see that we will be responsible for this--that he\nneedn't have anything to do with it or know anything about it. Then, if we\ndo anything wrong against your laws, he will be perfectly safe in stopping\nand punishing us.\"\n\nMiela nodded, and began swiftly telling this to the king. As she spoke I\nsaw his eyes twinkle and a swift little series of nods from the aged men\nabout the table made me know that I had carried my point. During the\nlatter part of this talk I had noticed the growing murmur of voices\noutside the castle. The old man who had left the room at the king's order\ncame back.\n\n\"The people now are gathering,\" Miela said. \"In a moment we shall go up\ninto the tower.\"\n\nThe king's councilors now rose and withdrew, and a few moments later the\nking, without formality, led the four of us through the castle and up into\nthe tower.\n\nWe climbed a little stone staircase in the tower and came into a circular\nroom some sixty feet above the ground. A small doorway from this room gave\naccess to the narrow balcony which girdled the tower. The sounds of the\ngathering crowd came up plainly from the gardens below. We waited for a\ntime, and then, at a sign from the king, stepped together upon the\nbalcony.\n\nThe gardens below were full of people--gathered among the palms and moving\nabout for points of vantage from which to obtain a view of the balcony.\nMost of them were men and older women. The girls were, nearly all of them,\nin the air, flying about the tower and hovering near the balcony, staring\nat us curiously. The women were, for the most part, dressed as I have\ndescribed Lua.\n\nThe men wore knee-length trousers of fabric or leather, and sometimes a\nshirt or leather jacket, although a difference of costume that made\nevident the rank of the wearer was noticeable in both sexes. All were\nbareheaded, with the exception of the king's guards, who were thus plainly\ndistinguishable, standing idly about among the crowd.\n\nAs we stepped out into view of the people a louder murmur arose, mingled\nwith a ripple of applause. Three or four girls, hovering only a few feet\nin front of us, clapped their hands and laughed. The king placed Mercer\nand me on either side of him, and, standing with his hands on our\nshoulders, leaned over the balcony rail and began to speak.\n\nA silence fell over the crowd; they listened quietly, but with none of\nthat respect and awe with which a people usually faces its king.\n\nMiela whispered to me. \"He is telling them about your earth, and that you\ncame here to visit us in friendly spirit.\"\n\nThere were some murmurs of dissent as the king proceeded, and once some\nbolder individual shouted up a question, at which a wave of laughter\narose. As it died away, and the crowd appeared to listen to the king's\nnext words, a stone suddenly came whirling up from below, narrowly missing\nthe king's head. A sudden hush fell over the people at this hostile act;\nthen a tumult of shouting broke loose, and a commotion off to one side\nshowed where the offender was standing.\n\nMercer wheeled toward me, his face white with anger.\n\n\"Who did that--did you see him? Which one was it?\"\n\nThe king began to speak, as if nothing had occurred, and an instant later\nseveral more stones whistled past us. The commotion in the crowd grew more\nviolent, but it was evident that a great majority of the people were\nagainst this demonstration.\n\n\"It is better we go inside,\" Miela said quietly.\n\nThe king was shouting down to his guards now, but they stood apathetically\nby, taking no part.\n\nAnother stone hurtled past us, striking the tower and falling at our feet.\nThe king abruptly ceased his shouting and left the balcony. As he passed\nme and I glanced into his frightened face I felt a sudden sense of pity\nfor this gentle, kindly old man, so well-meaning, but so utterly\nineffective as a ruler.\n\nI was about to pull Miela back into the room when a girl flew up to the\nbalcony railing. As she balanced herself upon it I saw it was Anina. She\nsaid something to Miela, who turned swiftly to me.\n\n\"She is right, my husband. We must not leave the matter like this. They\ncan have no confidence in you--our women most of all--if you do not do\nsomething now. A sign of your strength now would make them respect\nyou--perhaps one of those who threw the stones you could punish.\"\n\nI knew she was right. Most of the crowd was with us. If we retreated now,\nthose against us would grow bolder--our appearance on the street might at\nany time be dangerous. But if now we proved ourselves superior in\nstrength, the popular sentiment in our favor would be just that much\nstronger. At least, that is the way it seemed to me.\n\nI did not need to ask Mercer's opinion, for at Miela's words he\nimmediately said: \"That's my idea. Just give me a chance at them.\"\n\nHe leaned over the balcony. \"How are we going to get down there? It's too\nfar to drop.\"\n\nMiela spoke to Anina, and they both flew away. In a moment they were back\nwith two other girls. All four clung to the outside of the balcony\nrailing, and formed a cross with their joined hands. Into this little seat\nof their arms I clambered. My weight was too great for them to have lifted\nme up, but they fluttered safely with me to the ground, landing in a heap\namong the people, who had cleared a space to receive us. As soon as I was\nupon my feet the girls flew back for Mercer, and in a moment more he was\nbeside me.\n\n\"If we only knew who threw those stones,\" I said.\n\nI stood erect, and my greater height enabled me to see over the heads of\nthe people easily.\n\nMiela laid her hand on my arm.\n\n\"One of them I know. His name is Baar, a bad character. He has caused much\ntrouble in the past.\"\n\nShe then told me hastily that she and Anina would fly up and seek him out.\nMercer and I were to follow them through the crowd on the ground.\n\nThe throng was pushing close about us now, although those nearest us tried\nto keep away as best they could. Miela and Anina flew up over our heads,\nand, side by side, Mercer and I started off. The people struggled back\nbefore our advance, striving to make a path for us. At times the press of\nthose behind made it impossible for them to give us room. We did not\nhesitate, but shoved our way forward, elbowing them away roughly.\n\nSuddenly, some twenty feet ahead of us, I saw Miela and Anina come to the\nground, and in a moment more we were with them again.\n\nThe crowd was less dense here, and about us there was a considerable open\nspace, Miela pointed out a man leaning against the trunk of a palm tree\nnear by and glaring at us malevolently.\n\n\"That is he,\" she said quietly. \"A very bad man--this Baar--whom many\nwould like to see punished.\"\n\nMercer jumped forward, but I swept him back with my arm.\n\n\"Leave him to me,\" I said. \"You stand here by the girls. If I need you,\nI'll shout.\"\n\nThe man by the tree was a squat little individual, some five feet three or\nfour inches tall, and extraordinarily broad. He was bareheaded, with black\nhair falling to his shoulders. He was naked to the waist, exposing a\npowerful torso. His single garment was the usual knee-length trousers. I\nthought I had never seen so evil a face as his, as he stood there, holding\nhis ground before my slow advance, and leering at me. His cheek bones were\nhigh, his jowls heavy, his little eyes set wide apart. His nose was flat,\nas though it had once been broken.\n\nI went straight up to him, and he did not move. There were certainly three\nhundred people watching us as I stood there facing him.\n\n\"You threw a stone at your king,\" I said to him sternly, although I knew\nperfectly well he could not understand my words. \"You shall be punished.\"\n\nI reached out suddenly and struck him in the face as smartly as I could\nwith the flat of my hand. He gave a roar of surprise and pain, and as soon\nas he could recover from my blow lunged at me with a snarl of rage.\n\nAs he came I turned and darted swiftly away. I heard a shout of surprise\nfrom Mercer. \"It's all right,\" he called. \"Wait.\"\n\nI ran about twenty feet, then turned and waited. The man came on, head\ndown, charging like a mad bull. When he was close upon me I gathered my\nmuscles and sprang clear over his head, landing well behind him.\n\nHe stopped and looked around confusedly, evidently not quite sure at first\nwhat had become of me.\n\nMercer gave a shout of glee, and, to my great satisfaction, I heard it\ntaken up by the crowd, mingled with murmurs of surprise and awe.\n\nI stood quiet, and again my opponent charged me. I eluded him easily, and\nthen for fully ten minutes I taunted and baited him this way, as a\nskillful toreador taunts his bull. The crowd now seemed to enjoy the\naffair hugely.\n\nFinally I darted behind my adversary and, catching him by the shoulders,\ntripped him and laid him on his back on the ground A great roar of\nlaughter went up from the onlookers.\n\nThe man was on his feet again in an instant, breathing heavily, for indeed\nhe had nearly winded himself by his exertions. I ran over to Mercer.\n\n\"Go on,\" I said; \"show them what you can do.\"\n\nThe commotion of this contest had drawn many other spectators about us\nnow, but they kept a space clear, pushing back hurriedly before our sudden\nrushes. At my words Mercer darted forward eagerly. His first move was to\nleap some twenty feet across the open space. This smaller opponent seemed\nto give the Mercutian new courage.\n\nHe shouted exultantly and dashed at Mercer, who stood quietly waiting for\nhim at the edge of the crowd.\n\nMercer's ideas evidently were different from mine, for as his adversary\ncame within reach he stepped nimbly aside and hit him a vicious blow in\nthe face. The man toppled over backward and lay still.\n\nI ran over to where Mercer was bending over his fallen foe. As I came up\nhe straightened and grinned at me. \"Oh, shucks,\" he said disgustedly. \"You\ncan't fight up here--it's too easy.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nTHE MOUNTAIN CONCLAVE.\n\n\n\"It is reasonable,\" Miela said thoughtfully. \"And that our women will help\nas you say--of that I am sure.\"\n\nWe were gathered in the living room after the evening meal, and I had\ngiven them my ideas of how we should start meeting the situation that\nconfronted us. We had had no more trouble that day. After the encounter in\nthe king's garden Mercer and I had followed the two girls swiftly home. We\nwere not molested in the streets, although the people crowded about us\nwherever we went.\n\n\"Why did none of Baar's friends come to his rescue up there in the\ngarden?\" I asked Miela. \"Surely there must have been many of them about.\"\n\n\"They were afraid, perhaps,\" she answered. \"And they knew the people were\nagainst them. There might have been serious trouble; for that is not their\nway--to fight in the open.\"\n\nHer face became very grave. \"We must be very careful, my husband, that\nthey, or Tao's men do not come here to harm you while you sleep.\"\n\n\"Why do you suppose they ever happened to bring me here in the first\nplace?\" Mercer wanted to know. \"That's what I can't figure out.\"\n\n\"They knew not that Alan was here,\" said Miela. \"I think they wanted to\nshow you to our people as their captive--one of the earth-men.\"\n\nMercer chuckled.\n\n\"They didn't know what a good runner I was, or they'd never have taken a\nchance like that.\"\n\nI told Miela then my plan for enlisting the sympathy of the women of the\nLight Country and for securing the active co\u00f6peration of the girls in\nridding us of the disturbing presence of these Tao emissaries.\n\nWe planned that whatever we did should be in secret, so far as possible.\nMercer and I talked together, while Miela consulted with Lua at length.\n\nI explained to Mercer that Tao might at any time send an expedition to\ninvade the Light Country.\n\n\"How about that car we came from earth in?\" he suggested. \"He could sail\nover in that, couldn't he--if he should want to come over here?\"\n\nI knew that was not feasible. In the outer realms of space the balancing\nattractions of the different heavenly bodies made it easy enough to head\nin any specified direction; but for travel over a planet's surface it was\nquite impractical. Its rise and fall could be perfectly governed; but when\nit was directed laterally the case was very different. Just where it would\ngo could not be determined with enough exactness.\n\nMiela turned back to us from her consultation with Lua.\n\n\"In the mountains, high up and far beyond the Valley of the Sun,\" she\nsaid, \"lies a secret place known only to our women. Our mother says that\nshe and I and Anina can spread the news among our virgins to gather there\nto-morrow at the time of sleep. Only to those we know we can trust will we\nspeak--and they will have no men to whom to tell our plans. To-morrow they\nwill gather up there in the clouds, among the crags, unseen by prying\neyes. And you and our--our friend Ollie\"--she smiled as she used the\nnickname by which he had asked her to call him--\"you two we will take\nthere by the method you have told us. We will arrange, up there in secret,\nwhat it is we are to do to help our world and yours.\"\n\nThis, in effect, was our immediate plan of procedure. Nearly all the next\nday Mercer and I stayed about the house, while the three women went\nthrough the city quietly, calling forth all those they could reach to our\nconclave in the mountains.\n\nThey returned some time after midday. Miela came first, alighting with a\nswift, triumphant swoop upon the roof where Mercer and I were sitting.\n\nOne glance at her face told me she had been successful.\n\n\"They will come, my husband,\" she announced. \"And they are ready and\neager, all of them, to do what they can.\"\n\nAnina and Lua brought the same news. When we were all together again\nMercer and I took them to the garden behind the house and showed them what\nwe had done while they were away.\n\nIt was my plan to have the girls carry Mercer and me through the air with\nthem. For that purpose we had built a platform of bamboo, which now lay\nready in the garden.\n\nMiela clapped her hands at sight of it. \"That is perfect, my husband. No\ndifficulty will there be in taking you with us now.\"\n\nThe platform was six feet wide by ten long. It rested upon a frame with\ntwo poles of bamboo some forty feet in length running lengthwise along its\nedges. These two poles thus projected in front and back of the platform\nfifteen feet each way. Running under them crosswise at intervals were\nother, shorter bamboo lengths which projected out the sides a few feet to\nform handles. There were ten of them on a side at intervals of four feet.\n\nI found it difficult to realize the difference between night and day,\nsince here on Mercury the light never changed. I longed now for that\ndarkness of our own earth which would make it so much easier for us to\nconceal our movements. Miela relieved my mind on that score, however, by\nexplaining that at nearly the same hour almost every one in the city fell\nasleep. The physical desire for sleep was, I learned, much stronger with\nthe Mercutians than with us; and only by the drinking of a certain\nmedicinal beverage could they ward it off.\n\nIt was after the evening meal, at a time which might have corresponded to\nan hour or so before midnight, that the selected eighteen girls began to\narrive. Miela brought them into the living room with us until they were\nall together.\n\nIt was a curious gathering--this bevy of Mercutian maidens. They all\nseemed between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three--fragile, dainty\nlittle wisps of femininity, yet having a strength in their highly\ndeveloped wing muscles that was truly surprising.\n\nThey were dressed in the characteristic costume I have described, with\nonly a slight divergence of color or ornamentation. They were of only two\ntypes--jet black tresses, black eyes, and red-feathered wings like Miela;\nor the less vivid, more ethereal Anina--blue-eyed, golden-haired, with\nwing feathers of light blue.\n\nWhen they had all arrived we went into the garden behind the house. In a\nmoment more Mercer and I were seated side by side on the little bamboo\nplatform. Miela and Anina took the center positions so that they would be\nnear us. The other girls ranged themselves along the sides, each grasping\none of the handles.\n\nIn another moment we were in the air. My first sensation was one of a\nsudden rushing forward and upward. The frail little craft swayed under me\nalarmingly, but I soon grew used to that. The flapping of those many pairs\nof huge wings so close was very loud; the wind of our swift forward flight\nwhistled past my ears. Looking down over the side of the platform, between\nthe bodies of two of the girls, I could see the city silently dropping\naway beneath us. Above there was nothing but the same dead gray sky, black\nin front, with occasional vivid lightning flashes and the rumble of\ndistant thunder.\n\nUnderneath the storm cloud, far ahead, the jagged tops of a range of\nmountains projected above the horizon. As I watched they seemed slowly\ncreeping up and forward as the horizon rolled back to meet them.\n\nFor half an hour or so we sped onward through the air. We were over the\nmountains now. Great jagged, naked peaks of shining metal towered above\nus, with that broken, utterly desolate country beneath. We swept\ncontinually upward, for the mountains rose steadily in broad serrated\nranks before us.\n\nOccasionally we would speed up a narrow defile, with the broken, tumbling\ncliffs rising abruptly over our heads, only to come out above a level\nplateau or across a ca\u00f1on a thousand feet deep or more.\n\nThe storm broke upon us. We entered a cloud that wrapped us in its wet\nmist and hid the mountains from our sight. The darkness of twilight\nsettled down, lighted by flashes of lightning darting almost over our\nheads. The sharp cracks of thunder so close threatened to split my\neardrums.\n\nThe wind increased in violence. The little platform trembled and swayed. I\ncould see the girls struggling to hold it firm. At times we would drop\nabruptly straight down a hundred or two hundred feet, with a great\nfluttering of wings; but all the time I knew we were rising sharply.\n\nMercer and I clung tightly to the platform. We did not speak, and I think\nboth of us were frightened. Certainly we were awed by the experience.\nAfter a time--I have no idea how long--we passed through the storm and\ncame again into the open air with the same gray sky above us.\n\nWe were several thousand feet up now, flying over what seemed to be a\ntumbling mass of small volcanic craters. In front of us rose a sheer cliff\nwall, extending to the right and left to the horizon. We passed over its\nrim, and I saw that it curved slightly inward, forming the circumference\nof a huge circle.\n\nThe inner floor was hardly more than a thousand feet down, and seemed\nfairly level. We continued on, arriving finally over the mouth of a little\ncircular pit. This formed an inner valley, half a mile across and with\nsheer side walls some five hundred feet high. As we swung down into it I\nnoticed above the horizon behind us a number of tiny black dots in the\nsky--other girls flying out from the city to our meeting.\n\nI have never beheld so wild, so completely desolate a scene. The ground\nhere was that same shining mass of virgin metal, tumbled about and broken\nup in hopeless confusion.\n\nGreat rugged bowlders lay strewn about; tiny caverns yawned; fissures\nopened up their unknown depths; sharp-pointed crags reared their heads\nlike spires left standing amid the ruins of some huge cathedral. There\nwas, indeed, hardly a level spot of ground in sight.\n\nI wondered with vague alarm where we should land, for nowhere could I see\nsufficient space, even for our small platform. We were following closely\nthe line of cliff wall when suddenly we swooped sharply downward and to\nthe right with incredible speed. My heart leaped when, for an instant, I\nthought something had gone wrong. Then the forward end of the platform\ntilted abruptly upward; there was a sudden, momentary fluttering of wings,\na scrambling as the girls' feet touched the ground, and we settled back\nand came to rest with hardly more than a slight jar.\n\nMiela stood up, rubbing her arms, which must have ached from her efforts.\n\n\"We are here, Alan--safely, as we planned.\"\n\nWe had landed on a little rocky niche that seemed to be in front of the\nopening of a small cave mouth in the precipitous cliffside. I stood up\nunsteadily, for I was cramped and stiff, and the solid earth seemed\nswaying beneath me. I was standing on what was hardly more that a narrow\nshelf, not over fifteen feet wide and some thirty feet above the base of\nthe cliff.\n\nMercer was beside me, looking about him with obvious awe.\n\n\"What a place!\" he ejaculated.\n\nWe stepped cautiously to the brink of the ledge and peered over.\nUnderneath us, with the vertical wall of the cliff running directly down\ninto it, spread a small pool of some heavy, viscous fluid, inky black, and\nwith iridescent colors floating upon its surface. It bubbled and boiled\nlazily, and we could feel its heat on our faces plainly.\n\nBeyond the pool, not more than a hundred yards across, lay a mass of\nragged bowlders piled together in inextricable confusion; beyond these a\nchasm with steam rising from it, whose bottom I could not see--a crack as\nthough the ground had suddenly cooled and split apart. Across the entire\nsurface of this little cliff-bound circular valley it was the same, as\nthough here a tortured nature had undergone some terrible agony in the\nbirth of this world.\n\nThe scene, which indeed had something infernal about it, would have been\nextraordinary enough by itself; but what made it even more so was the fact\nthat several hundred girls were perched among these crags, sitting idle,\nor standing up and flapping their wings like giant birds, and more were\nmomentarily swooping in from above. I had, for an instant, the feeling\nthat I was Dante, surveying the lower regions, and that here was a host of\nangels from heaven invading them.\n\nDuring the next hour fully a thousand girls arrived. There were perhaps\nfifteen hundred altogether, and only a few stragglers were hastily flying\nin when we decided to wait no longer.\n\nMiela flew out around the little valley, calling them to come closer. They\ncame flying toward us and crowded upon the nearer crags just beyond the\npool, clutching the precipitous sides, and scrambling for a foothold\nwherever they could. A hundred or more found place on the ledge with us,\nor above or below it wherever a slight footing could be found on the wall\nof the cliff.\n\nWhen they were all settled, and the scrambling and flapping of wings had\nceased, Miela stood up and addressed them. A solemn, almost sinister hush\nlay over the valley, and her voice carried far. She spoke hardly above the\nordinary tone, earnestly, and occasionally with considerable emphasis, as\nthough to drive home some important point.\n\nFor nearly half an hour she spoke without a break, then she called me to\nher side and put one of her wings caressingly about my shoulders. I did\nnot know what she said, but a great wave of handclapping and flapping of\nwings answered her. She turned to me with glowing face.\n\n\"I have told them about your wonderful earth, and Tao's evil plans; and\njust now I said that you were my husband--and I, a wife, can still fly as\nwell as they. That is a very wonderful thing, Alan. No woman ever, in this\nworld, has been so blessed as I. They realize that--and they respect me\nand love you for it.\"\n\nShe did not wait for me to speak, but again addressed the assembled girls.\nWhen she paused a chorus of shouts answered her. Many of the girls in\ntheir enthusiasm lost their uncertain footholds and fluttered about,\nseeking others. For a moment there was confusion.\n\n\"I have told them briefly what we are to do,\" Miela explained. \"First, to\nrid the Great City of Tao's men, sending them back to the Twilight\nCountry; and do this in all our other cities where they are making\ntrouble. Then, when our nation is free from this danger, we will plan how\nto deal with Tao direct, for he must not again go to your earth.\n\n\"And when all that is done I have said you will do your best to make our\nmen believe as you do, so that never again will our women marry only to\nlose all that makes their virginity so glorious.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nTHE FIRE PLANET.\n\n\nI think I should explain now a little about the physical conformation of\nMercury--the \"lay of the land,\" so to speak--in order that the events I am\nabout to describe may be more readily understood. It has already been made\nclear by Bob Trevor, I believe, that Mercury revolves on its axis only\nonce during the time of its revolution around the sun. Thus, just as a\nsimilar condition always makes our moon present very nearly the same face\nto us, so Mercury presents always the same portion of its surface to the\nsun.\n\nIt will be understood, therefore, that, theoretically, there must be on\nMercury but one spot where the sun always is directly overhead. It could\nnot be seen, however, owing to the dense clouds. This spot approximates\nthe center of the region known as the Fire Country.\n\nSo far as I could learn, it was here that human life on the planet began.\nCertainly it was the first region where civilization reached any height.\nWhen Columbus was discovering America great cities flourished in the Fire\nCountry--cities of untold wealth and beauty, now fallen into ruins like\nthe great cities of our own Aztec and Inca civilizations.\n\nThe Fire Country was then like the equatorial regions of earth--a dense,\ntropic jungle, hotter than most temperatures we have to bear, but still,\nby reason of its thick enveloping atmosphere of clouds, capable of\nsupporting life in comparative comfort. Its inhabitants were dark-skinned,\nbut rather more like our Indians than Negroid races.\n\nThen, several centuries ago--the exact time is uncertain, for no written\nrecords are kept on Mercury--came the Great Storms. Their cause was\nunknown--some widespread atmospheric disturbance. These storms temporarily\nparted the clouds in many places, allowing the direct rays of the sun to\nfall upon the planet's surface. The resulting temperature destroyed all\nlife, withered all vegetation, with its scorching blast. The inhabitants\nof the Fire Country were killed by hundreds of thousands, their cities\ndeserted, their land laid a desert waste.\n\nThese storms, which it appears began suddenly, have returned periodically\never since, making the region practically uninhabitable. Its surviving\nraces, pushed outward toward the more temperate zone, were living, at this\ntime I am describing, in a much lower state of civilization than the\npeople of the Light Country--a civilization of comparative savagery. In\nthe Light Country they were held as slaves.\n\nThis region--thus very aptly known as the Fire Country--embraces a\ncircular area directly underneath the sun. So far as I could learn, it\nextended outward roughly to those points where--if it had been\nvisible--the sun would have appeared some halfway between zenith and\nhorizon.\n\nLying outside the circle, in a larger, concentric ring, is the zone known\nas the Light Country. Entirely free from the equatorial storms, no direct\nrays of sunlight have ever penetrated its protecting cloud blanket. Here\nexists the highest state of civilization on the planet.\n\nBeyond the Light Country, in another concentric ring, lies the Twilight\nCountry. It forms a belt about the planet, beginning roughly at those\npoints at which the sun would appear only a short distance above the\nhorizon, and extending back to where the sun would be below the horizon.\nIn this region, as its name implies, there is never more than twilight. It\nis lightest at the borders of the Light Country, and fades into night at\nits other side.\n\nStill farther, beyond the twilight zone, lies the region of perpetual\nnight and cold--the Dark Country. This area embraces the rest of the\nplanet, comprising something less than half of its entire surface. Here is\neternal night--a night of Stygian darkness, unlighted even by the stars,\nsince the same atmosphere makes them invisible.\n\nThe Dark Country, so far as it has been explored--which is very little--is\na rocky waste and a sea of solid ice that never melts. Near the borders of\nthe Twilight Country a few people like our Eskimos exist--savages with\nhuge white faces, and great, staring eyes. There are a few fur-bearing\nanimals and birds, but except for this fringe of life the Dark Country is\nthought to be uninhabited, its terrible cold making life in any form\nimpossible.\n\nSo much, in general, for the main geographical features of Mercury. The\nGreat City stands about halfway between the borders of the Fire Country\nand the edge of the twilight zone. This level marshland, the barren,\nmetallic mountains, and a sort of semitropic jungle, partly inundated by\nwater, comprise nearly all the area of the Light Country.\n\nFrom the Great City, through the watery jungle, extends a system of little\nwinding bayous--a perfect maze of them, with hundreds of\nintercommunicating branches--which it would be almost impossible to\ntraverse without losing all sense of direction.\n\nBeyond these bayous, into which their sluggish currents flow, lies the\nNarrow Sea. On its farther shore begins the Twilight Country, much of it a\nbarren, semifrigid waste, with a little level, tillable land, vast rocky\nmountain ranges, and a few forests.\n\nIn spite of its inhospitable character the Twilight Country is fairly\ndensely populated; and, I realized when I got into it, civilized life is\nexceedingly difficult to maintain there. I understood then why the\nTwilight People were so envious of land in the Light Country; and, in\ntruth, I could not blame them for that, or for looking toward our earth\nwith longing.\n\nBut just as the Light Country People had defended their borders with\nimplacable determination, so was I determined that they should not invade\nmy world, either. And I was ready to stake my life and even the lives of\nthose I loved here on Mercury in the attempt to prevent them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nTHE FIGHT AT THE BAYOU.\n\n\nMiela proceeded to explain our plan in detail to these fifteen hundred\nenthusiastic allies. It was my idea to build several platforms similar to\nthis one on which Mercer and I had been carried up here into the\nmountains, only somewhat larger. We then proposed to seize these\nemissaries of Tao--there were not more than eight or ten of them\naltogether in the Great City--capturing them at night, without alarm, if\npossible, and transporting them summarily into the Twilight Country. My\ntheory was that if they were to disappear thus mysteriously the people of\nthe Great City would have no particular cause to make trouble afterward,\nand we hoped that the affair would soon be forgotten.\n\nMiela thought it practical for us to carry them in this way across the\nNarrow Sea. The Lone City, from which Tao was operating, was located near\nthe edge of the sea, and if we gave them food they would be enabled to\nreach it in safety in a day or two. The girls agreed enthusiastically with\nthis plan, and we selected a number to carry it out.\n\nMeanwhile we planned also to organize a system of a\u00ebrial patrols, and\ndetailed some two hundred of the girls, who in varying shifts were to fly\nback and forth along the borders of the sea over its Light Country shore,\nto make sure that Tao did not attempt to make a crossing by water.\n\n\"Can't they fly over as well as we can?\" Mercer objected. \"Their women\nfly, too, don't they?\"\n\nThe women of the Twilight Country did fly, but for two reasons we did not\nfear an attack from them in the air. First, Miela doubted that the women\nwould concern themselves in the affair; they were stupid and\napathetic--fit only for child-bearing. The men might, of course, force\nthem to the attempt, but even in that event, Miela explained, it would\nresult in little; for generations of comparative inactivity and the colder\nclimate had made them inclined to stoutness. Their wing muscles were weak\nand flabby, and with their greater weight of body they flew very badly.\n\n\"Suppose Tao should come over?\" I suggested to Miela. \"I don't believe he\nwill--but if he should, how could we stop him?\"\n\n\"By water he would come,\" she answered. \"In boats--small they are, I\nthink, those he has. We could not stop him, for the light-ray he would\nbring. But our women, flying over the ocean, would see him coming, and\ntell our king. More we could not do now.\"\n\n\"You mean this patrol would give the government the warning it won't\nobtain for itself? There would be war then? The people would arm to resist\ninvasion?\"\n\nMiela smiled sadly.\n\n\"There would be war, Alan. But our government--our people--do not look for\nit. They are like the peeta bird, that hides its head under its wing when\nit is threatened.\"\n\nThe time of sleep was now nearly over, and we thought it best that the\ngirls should fly back at once, so that their arrival at the city would\ncause as little comment as possible.\n\nMercer and I seated ourselves on the platform as before; the twenty girls\ngrasped its handles, raising it until they were all upon their feet; then,\nat a signal, we left the ground. The trip back seemed shorter than coming\nup. The girls all left the valley together, flying up helter-skelter, and\ncircling about us as we flew steadily onward.\n\nNear the Great City the girls spread out, so as to approach it from\ndifferent directions and thus attract less attention, although the time of\nsleep was not yet over and we knew that few would be stirring about the\ncity.\n\nWhen we reached home we greeted Lua, and dismissed the girls, arranging\nthat they were to come back again that evening--fifty of them this\ntime--to carry the larger platform we were to build. We then had\nbreakfast, and after telling Lua the result of the meeting--at which she\nwas greatly pleased--we went immediately to bed, for we were worn out.\n\nIt was about noon, I suppose, when we awoke. Mercer and I spent the\nafternoon building the platform on which to carry Tao's men--a framework\nwith fifty handles instead of twenty. Miela and Anina disappeared for the\nwhole afternoon. I did not know what they were doing at the time; later I\nfound out Anina was devoting it to learning English.\n\nDuring the evening meal we planned it all. Tao's men were living in a\nhouse near the edge of the city--the house Tao had occupied before he was\nbanished to the Twilight Country. It had no other occupants at this time.\n\nWe had learned where they kept their boats in one of the bayous near by,\nand in it we intended to take them to the sea, where we would meet the\ngirls, who would then fly with them to the Twilight Country. But we could\nnot figure out how to capture them without alarming the city. We were sure\nthey were unarmed; they had been carefully searched by the authorities\nwhen they entered the country. But they were ten to our two.\n\nMercer voiced the problem most emphatically.\n\n\"Ten men in a house,\" he declared. \"Maybe we can catch them all asleep.\nBut even if they are, how are we going to get them out? There'd be a row,\nand we don't want any noise. Besides, there's always this confounded\ndaylight here. If we tied them up somebody might see us when we got\noutside. How do we get them out of that house without any rumpus, and down\nto that boat? That's what I don't see.\"\n\n\"I--do--that,\" said Anina suddenly.\n\nShe had spoken in English, and we looked at her in amazement. She lisped\nthe words in her soft, sweet voice, haltingly, like a little child. Then\nshe turned to Miela and poured out a torrent of her native language.\nMercer stared at her in undisguised admiration.\n\nAs Miela explained it, Anina proposed that she go into Tao's house alone,\nand decoy his men down to the boat where we could capture them.\n\n\"But how will she get them there?\" I exclaimed. \"What will she tell them?\"\n\n\"She says she can make them think she is one of those few of our women who\nsympathize with their cause,\" Miela explained. \"And she will say that the\nearth-man who escaped from them she has seen lurking about their boat;\nperhaps he plans to steal it. She will go there with them, and they can\nrecapture him.\"\n\n\"They might not all go,\" said Mercer. \"We want to get them all.\"\n\n\"It is Anina's thought that they will all go, for they fear this earth-man\nmuch--and all would go to make sure of him.\"\n\nI could not feel it was right for us to let Anina do so daring a thing,\nand Mercer agreed with me heartily. But Anina insisted, with a fire in her\neyes and flushed cheeks that contrasted strangely with her usually gentle\ndemeanor.\n\nIn the end Mercer and I gave in, for we could think of no better plan, and\nMiela was confident Anina would not be harmed.\n\nIt was about what would correspond with ten o'clock in the evening on\nearth when the girls began to arrive. We waited until all fifty of them\nhad come in. Miela named a place on the shore of the sea known to them\nall. They were to take the platform--starting in about two hours, when the\ncity would be quiet--and there they would wait for us to join them in the\nboat.\n\nWe four started out together, but soon Anina left us to make her way to\nTao's house alone. Mercer, Miela and I then hurried as fast as we could\nthrough the city down to the marshlands, and to the secluded spot on the\nbayou's bank where the boat was lying.\n\nThe bayou here was about a hundred feet wide, a winding, brackish stream,\nlined on both sides with trees whose roots were in the water and whose\nbranches at times nearly met overhead. Its banks were a tangled mass of\ntree roots, huge ferns, palmettos and some tall upstanding kind of water\ngrass. Half submerged logs jutted out into the sluggish current, making it\nin places seem almost impassable.\n\nA narrow metal boat--a very long and very narrow motor boat with a\nthatched shelter like a small cabin over part of its length--lay fastened\nto a tree near at hand. I noticed at once some mechanism over its stern.\n\nWe had come up quietly to make sure no one was about. Now we hid ourselves\nclose to the boat and waited with apprehension in our hearts for the\narrival of Anina with Tao's men.\n\nHalf an hour, perhaps, went by. The silence in this secluded spot hung\nheavy about us. A fish broke the glassy surface of the water; a lizard\nscurried along the ground; a bird flitted past. Then, setting our hearts\npounding, came the soft snapping of underbrush that we knew was the\ncautious tread of some one approaching. I was half reclining under a\nfallen tree, with a clump of palmettos about me. I parted their fronds\ncarefully before my face. A few yards away a man was standing motionless,\nstaring past me and apparently listening intently.\n\nHe moved forward after a moment. I feared he was coming almost upon us,\nbut he turned aside, bending low down as he crept slowly forward. Sounds\nin the underbrush reached me now from other directions, and I knew that\nthe men had spread apart and were stalking the boat, expecting Mercer to\nbe in or near it.\n\nHad they all come down here? I wondered. And where was Anina? I looked\ndown at Miela warningly as I felt her move slightly.\n\n\"We'll wait till they're all near the boat,\" I whispered to Mercer.\n\nI saw Anina a moment later soaring over the bayou just above the treetops.\nI sighed with relief, for it was a signal to us that everything was all\nright. We continued to wait until the men had all come into view. They\nwent at the boat with a sudden rush. Several of them climbed into it, with\nshouts to the others.\n\nWith a significant glance to Mercer I leaped suddenly to my feet. I was\nperhaps twenty feet from the boat, and the space between us was fairly\nclear. A single bound landed me beside it, almost among four of the men\nwho were standing there in a group. Before they had time to face me I was\nupon them.\n\nI scattered them like nine-pins, and two of them went down under my blows.\nThe other two flung themselves upon me. I stumbled over some inequality of\nthe ground, and we all three fell prone. This was the first time I had\ncome actually to hand grips with any of the Mercutians.\n\nI felt now not only their lack of strength, but a curious frailness about\ntheir bodies--a seeming absence of solidity that their stocky appearance\nbelied. These two men were like half-grown boys in my hands. I was back on\nmy feet in a moment, leaving one of them lying motionless. The other rose\nto his knees, his face white with pain and terror.\n\nI left him there and looked about me. Miela was fluttering around near by,\nas I had instructed her--just off the ground and with the whole scene\nunder her eyes. It was she on whom I depended for warning should any of\nthe quarry attempt to escape us.\n\nAt the edge of the water another man was lying, whom I assumed Mercer had\nfelled. There was a great commotion from the boat. I ran toward it. A man\nwas standing beside it--an old man with snow-white hair. He stood still,\nseeming confused and in doubt what to do. As I neared him he turned\nclumsily to avoid me. I passed him by and bounded over the boat's gunwale,\nlanding in its bottom. The first thing I saw was Mercer struggling to his\nfeet with four of the Mercutians hanging on him. One had a grip on his\nthroat from behind; another clutched him about the knees.\n\nThe two others let go of him when they heard me land in the boat. One had\nevidently had enough, for he dived overboard. The other waited warily for\nmy onslaught. As I got within reach I hit at his face, but my blow went\nwild. He hit me full in the chest, but it was the blow of a child.\n\nAt that instant I heard Mercer give a choking cry, and out of the corner\nof my eye saw him go down again. I could waste no more time upon this\nsingle antagonist. The man had his hands at my throat now. I seized him\nabout the waist and carried him to the gunwale. He clung to me as a rat\nmight cling to a terrier, but I shook him off and dumped him in the water.\n\nI turned to Mercer just as he was struggling to his feet again, and in a\nmoment more between us we had felled his two assailants. Mercer's face was\nvery white, and I saw blood streaming from a wound on his head; but he\ngrinned as he faced me.\n\n\"Have we--got 'em--all?\" he gasped. He dashed the blood away from his eyes\nwith the flat of his hand. \"I fell--damn it--right at the start, and hit\nmy head. Where are they all? Have we got 'em?\"\n\nMiela alighted in the boat beside us.\n\n\"Two are running,\" she said. \"They are together. Hasten.\"\n\nWe jumped out of the boat. Miela flew up, and we followed her guidance\nthrough the dense woods. We could make much better speed, I knew, than the\nMercutians. \"We'll get them all, Ollie,\" I shouted at Mercer. \"They're not\nfar ahead. See up there--Miela's evidently over them now.\"\n\nWe came up to them after a few hundred yards. It was the old man, and one\nof those whom I had first encountered. They did not wait for us to attack\nthem, but stopped stock still, flinging their arms wide in token of\nsurrender.\n\nMiela came down among us, and we went back to where we had lain hidden in\nthe palmettos. There we had left a number of short lengths of rope. While\nwe were tying the arms of these two prisoners behind them and fettering\ntheir ankles so they could not run Anina joined us.\n\n\"Two--in water,\" she cried; and then added something to Miela.\n\n\"Two were in the water. Now they are in the woods, running. Anina will\nshow you.\"\n\nMiela stood guard in the boat over our first two prisoners, while Mercer\nand I rounded up the others. It was half an hour or more before we had\nthem all trussed up, but none of the ten escaped. We were a long time\nreviving two of those we had injured, but finally we had them all lying or\nsitting in the boat.\n\nMercer's head had stopped bleeding. He washed it, and I found his injury\nno more than an ugly scalp wound.\n\n\"I fell and cut it on something,\" he explained lugubriously. \"Couldn't see\nfor the blood in my eyes. But we got 'em, didn't we?\"\n\nUnder Miela's direction Mercer and I shoved the boat out into the stream.\nI need not go into details regarding the propelling mechanism of this\ncraft. Miela explained it hastily to me as we got under way. It used a\nform of the light-ray from a sort of strange battery. The intense heat of\nthe ray generated a great pressure of superheated steam in a thick metal\ncylinder underneath the keel.\n\nThis steam escaped through a nozzle under water at the stern of the boat,\nand its thrust against the water propelled the boat forward. The boat was\nconstructed to draw very little water, and when going fast its bow planed\nupward until only the stern of the hull touched the surface. It was\nsteered by a rudder not much different from some of those types we are\nfamiliar with on earth. When we got out into open water I found the boat\nwas capable of great speed. This I attributed not so much to the efficacy\nof its propelling force as to the lightness of the boat itself. It was\nbuilt of some metal that I may perhaps compare with aluminium, only this\nwas far stronger and lighter. The boat was, in fact, a mere shell,\nextraordinarily buoyant.\n\nMiela sat in the stern, steering and operating the mechanism. I sat with\nher. Mercer was farther forward, beside Anina, talking to her earnestly.\nOur prisoners lay huddled in various attitudes--frightened, all of them,\nand obviously in no condition to give us further trouble. They were, I saw\nnow, not ruffians by any means, but rather men of superior intelligence,\nselected by Tao evidently as those best fitted for spreading his\npropaganda among the people of the Great City.\n\nWe made slow progress down the bayou. Some of its turns were so sharp and\nso overhung with trees, and obstructed by fallen logs, we could hardly get\nthrough. During the latter part of the trip the bayou broadened rapidly,\ndividing into many channels like a delta.\n\nWe came out into the open sea finally--a broad, empty expanse, with a\nmirrorlike surface. The curvature of the planet was even more apparent\nnow; it seemed almost as though the water should be sliding back downhill\nover the horizon.\n\nWe turned to the left as we came out of the delta, and for the first time\nMiela put the boat to the limit of its speed. The best comparison I can\nmake, I think, to this rapid, noiseless, smooth progress, is that of\nsailing on an iceboat.\n\nWe sped along some five or ten miles, keeping close inland. I saw some of\nthe small thatched shacks along here, though not many. For a while the\nshore remained that same palm-lined, half-inundated marshland. Then\ngradually it began to change, and we came upon a broad beach of white\nsand.\n\nWe landed here, and found the girls with the platform waiting for us.\nMiela took Anina and one or two of the older girls aside, and gave them\nlast instructions.\n\n\"What do I do--just dump them on the other shore?\" Mercer asked me.\n\n\"That's about it. I don't know the lay of the land over there. Anina does.\nYou do what she tells you.\"\n\n\"You bet I will,\" he agreed enthusiastically. \"Some kid--that little girl.\nWe get along fine. She understands everything I say to her already. I'll\nhave her talking English like a streak by the time you see her again.\"\n\nWe had removed the cords from our prisoners' ankles. I motioned them to\nget out of the boat. We crowded Tao's men on the platform. They were\nsurprised, and some of them alarmed, when they saw how we proposed to\ntransport them over the water. Miela silenced their protests, and soon we\nhad them all seated on the platform, with Mercer at the rear end facing\nthem.\n\nThe fifty girls grasped the platform handles. Another moment and they were\nin the air, with Mercer waving good-by to us vigorously.\n\nMiela and I, left alone, watched them silently as they dwindled to a speck\nin the haze of the sky.\n\nWe were about to start back when we saw a girl coming toward us, flying\nlow over the water. One of those we had directed to patrol the coast,\nMiela said when she came closer. She saw us, and came down on the beach.\n\nThe two girls spoke together hurriedly.\n\n\"Tao's men in the Water City have caused great disturbance, Alan,\" Miela\nsaid to me.\n\n\"Where's the Water City?\"\n\n\"Near the Great City--across the marshlands. We must get back. And when\nAnina and our friend Ollie have returned we must go to the Water City. It\nis very bad there, she said.\"\n\nOur trip back to the Great City was without unusual incident. We followed\nthe main route at the best speed we could make.\n\n\"We shall tell our king, of course, about this disturbance,\" said Miela.\n\"Perhaps he will think there is something he can do. But I fear greatly\nthat unless he appeals directly to the people, and they are with him--\"\n\n\"He's an old man,\" I said, \"and all his councilors are old. They're not\nfit to rule at such a time as this. Suppose he were to die--what would\nhappen? Who would be king then?\"\n\n\"A little prince there is--a mere child. And there is our queen--a younger\nwoman, only married to our king these few years. His first queen died.\"\n\nI questioned Miela concerning her government. It was, I soon learned, an\nautocracy in theory. But of later years the king's advanced age, and his\nequally old councilors whom he refused to change, had resulted in a\nvacillating policy of administration, which now, I could see plainly, left\nthe government little or no real power.\n\nOnly by constantly pandering to the wishes of the people could the king\nhold his throne. The supreme command was held by the king and his aged\ncouncilors. At stated intervals the more prominent men of each city met\nand enacted laws. The cities were each ruled by a governor in similar\nfashion, paying tribute to the central government somewhat after our old\nfeudal system; but for practical purposes they acted as separate nations.\nThey were united merely by the bonds of their common need of defense\nagainst the Twilight People, and of intermarriage, which was frequent,\nsince the virgins, flying about, often found mates in cities other than\ntheir own.\n\nThere were courts in each city, not much more than rude tribunals, and\njails in which the offenders were held. The police I have already\nmentioned. They, like the king's guards, were inclined in an emergency to\ndo, not so much what they were ordered, as what they thought the people\nwished.\n\nIt was all very extraordinary, but like many another makeshift government\nit served, after a fashion.\n\nHiding the boat in another bayou, we took our way home on foot. That is to\nsay, I ran, and Miela followed me, alternately flying and walking. We made\nour best speed this way, and very soon were back at home in the Great\nCity.\n\nWe crossed the garden and entered the front door, expecting to find Lua in\nthe living room, but she was not there. The house was quiet.\n\n\"She would wait up, she told me,\" Miela said, and, raising her voice,\ncalled her mother's name.\n\nThere was no answer, although now I remember I thought I heard a footfall\nupstairs.\n\nWe went up to Lua's room hurriedly. It was empty, and our loud cries of\nanxiety throughout the house evoked no response. We entered our own\nbedroom, and before I could make a move to defend myself I was seized\ntightly by both elbows from behind.\n\nAt the same instant an arm hooked around my neck under my chin and jerked\nmy head backward, and another pair of arms clutched me around the knees. I\nstruggled vainly to free myself, shouting to Miela to run.\n\nBut there were too many holding me. A moment more and my arms were tied\nbehind me and a rope was about my legs. I was pushed into a chair, and as\nI sat down I saw Miela standing quietly near by, with two Mercutians\nholding her by the arms and shoulders.\n\nThe man who had pushed me to the seat bent down and struck me across the\ncheek with the flat of his hand. His grinning, malevolent face was only a\nfew inches from mine. I saw that it was Baar!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nREVOLUTION.\n\n\nThere seemed to be five of our captors, all of them as evil-looking men as\nI think I have ever seen. They rummaged about the room, evidently in\nsearch for weapons they thought I might have secreted. Then they ordered\nme to stand up, and without more ado led Miela and me from the house.\n\nThis was once when I was glad of the interminable daylight. I hoped we\nmight find some early risers about the streets, for I thought certainly\nthe time of sleep must now be nearly over. But no one was in sight as we\nleft the garden. We turned the first corner and headed toward the base of\nthe mountain.\n\n\"To Baar's house they are taking us, I think. It is on the marshland\nbelow.\" Miela spoke without fear of our captors understanding the English\nwords. We took advantage of this until after a moment we were roughly\nordered to be quiet.\n\nLua, we thought, must have been taken away before we arrived; we would\nfind her at Baar's house when we arrived there. We had come down to the\nlevel marshlands now, the outskirts of the city, and were passing along a\npath between occasional shacks. Before us, standing alone in a rice paddy,\nI saw a larger, more pretentious house--a wooden structure on stilts, with\na thatched roof, which Miela said was where Baar lived.\n\nWe went in single file up its board incline, and entered a squalid room\nwith matting on the floor, a rude charcoal brazier at one side, and the\nremains of a previous meal lying on a table.\n\nTwo women were in the room as we entered. I took these to be Baar's wife\nand a servant. Two naked little children lay on the floor, one of them\ncrying lustily.\n\nBaar glanced around as he came in, and with what I took to be an oath\nordered the children removed from the room. The slave woman--I could see\nshe was a slave by the band upon her arm--picked them up. Evidently she\ndid not move fast enough to suit Baar's temper, for as she straightened up\nthe man cuffed her upon the head. She stumbled to one side against Baar's\nwife, who was standing there, and the other woman, with a sharp\nimprecation, struck her full in the breast.\n\nNeither of them saw the look she gave as she shuffled away, carrying the\ninfants; but I did. It was a look of the most intense hatred, born and\nnourished, I realized, by long ill-treatment.\n\nMiela and I were now bound securely hand and foot, and Miela's wings were\nlashed to her body. Thus rendered entirely helpless, we were laid together\nin a corner.\n\nFrom the talk that followed Miela gathered that Baar and his men were\nexpecting the arrival of others. He roughly ordered his wife--a woman of\nthe Twilight Country, obviously--to clear away the remains of their last\nmeal and bring other food. She obeyed submissively.\n\nThis, the first of the Twilight Country People I had seen, was a thick-set\nwoman of perhaps thirty-five, although she might have been older, for her\nblack hair, which fell in an unkempt mass to her waist, was beginning to\ngray. She wore a single garment, a pair of silken trousers, drab with\ndirt. Her clipped wings were covered in the usual way.\n\nI could see now why Miela had said these Twilight women could not fly, for\nthis woman's torso was fat and flabby. Her skin was curiously pale--a\ndead, unpleasant white. Her face was broad, heavy and unintelligent. Her\neyes were large and protruded slightly.\n\nBaar and his men ate breakfast, paying no further attention to Miela and\nme. Suddenly Miela spoke in a frightened whisper. \"They are going now in a\nmoment to the castle. The king they will kill!\"\n\nIt was evidently a widespread plot we now overheard. Baar's followers had\nfor some time been talking quietly with the lower classes, and, finding\nthey could count on their support, planned now to murder the king. Then\nwith the queen and the little prince held as hostages, they expected that\nthe men of science, threatened also with a revolt of the peons, would\nrelease the light-ray.\n\nThe light-ray once in his control, Baar could make himself king. It seemed\nan absurd hope, but such was the plan they were now discussing. And what\nwas far worse, I could see no way by which I could prevent the attempt.\n\n\"They are going to the castle--now--to murder the king?\" I whispered,\nincredulous.\n\n\"Yes,\" Miela answered. \"So they plan. Now--in a moment--before the time of\nsleep is over.\"\n\n\"Isn't he guarded? Can they get in the castle without arousing others?\"\n\n\"There are the guards--a few. But Baar has promised them great wealth, and\nthey will stand aside and let him pass. So it is arranged.\"\n\nThe arrival of several other men interrupted our whispered conversation.\nBaar, his meal over, consulted with them hurriedly. He then instructed his\nwife to watch us, and after a moment they all left the house.\n\nThe woman, who was now the only occupant of the room with us, shuffled\nabout, clearing away the meal. I tried desperately to work my hands loose;\nI even tried with my teeth to gnaw Miela's bonds, but without success.\nEvery moment counted, if we were to do anything to save the king. I\nwondered again where Lua was--perhaps in another part of the house here,\nbound as we were.\n\n\"Miela,\" I whispered, \"ask for food. Tell her we have had nothing for many\nhours. Perhaps she will loosen our bonds a little to let us eat. We may be\nable to do something then.\"\n\nThe woman answered Miela's pleading by setting us up side by side, with\nour backs against the wall. She placed food before us, and then, with a\nknife, cut the cords that bound our arms.\n\nMy heart leaped exultantly; but, instead of leaving us and going on with\nher work, she sat down just out of reach, holding the knife in her hand\nand watching us narrowly.\n\n\"We must eat, Miela,\" I said, using as casual a tone as I could and\npointing to the food smilingly. \"Eat, and pretend not to notice her.\nPerhaps I can get to my feet.\"\n\nWe ate the food she had given us. I tensed the muscles of my legs, and\nbelieved that, bound as I was, I might be able to leap forward and reach\nthe woman. It was almost hopeless to attempt it, for I realized she would\nmeet my body with the dagger point.\n\nWe were still eating, and I was thinking over this plan, when the slave\nwoman appeared silently in a doorway across the room, behind the woman who\nfaced us. Something in her attitude made me look away again casually and\ngo on with my eating.\n\nMiela had evidently not noticed her.\n\nThe slave woman came slowly toward us. A moment later she hurled herself\nupon Baar's wife from behind. At the same instant I threw myself forward,\nfalling prone, but within reach of the seated woman. I gripped her with my\nhands, fumbling to catch her wrists, but before I could succeed she\ntoppled forward and fell partly over me.\n\nI heard Miela give a cry of fright. I struggled free and raised myself up\nto a half-sitting position. Baar's wife lay beside me dead, with the slave\nwoman's knife buried to the hilt in her back.\n\nReaching over, I took the knife from the dead woman's fingers, and with it\ncut the cords that bound my ankles. I sprang to my feet. The slave had\nretreated and stood shrinking against the side of the room, terrified at\nwhat she had done. I paid no more attention to her for the moment, but\nhastened to release Miela.\n\nWe searched the house hurriedly, calling to Lua; but she did not answer,\nnor could we find her. When we returned the slave woman was still standing\nwhere we had left her, staring with horrified eyes at the body of her\nmistress.\n\n\"Tell her what she did was right,\" I said. \"She may have saved the king.\nTell her to go to your house and wait for us.\"\n\nThe woman nodded eagerly when Miela told her what to do, and fell on her\nknees before us.\n\n\"She says she will serve us always. She has been very badly treated,\nAlan.\"\n\nWe sent the woman away, and with a last hasty glance around hurriedly left\nthe house alone with its single dead occupant. A large wooden mortar and\npestle, used for pounding rice, stood in the kitchen. I carried the pestle\naway with me; it was nearly five feet long and quite heavy--an excellent\nweapon.\n\nWe hastened up through the city--Miela half walking, half flying, and I\ncarrying this bludgeon and running with twelve-foot strides. But it was\nnow hardly more than three-quarters of an hour since we had passed this\nway before, and there were still few people about to see us. Baar and his\nmen had started some twenty minutes before us, I figured, and we must\nreach the castle before them.\n\nI made extraordinary progress over the level country. But I could not run\nuphill for long, and soon had to slow down to a walk. Miela kept closer to\nme now. We approached the castle grounds.\n\n\"Where will the guards be, Miela? We must avoid them if we can. They might\ntry to stop us.\"\n\nMiela did not know where they would be; but under the circumstances, as\nBaar had told his men, she believed the guards would disappear from the\nvicinity. This conjecture proved to be correct. The guards, not wishing to\nbe concerned in the affair at all, had simply disappeared. We saw nothing\nof Baar and his men on the way up the mountain, although I had hoped we\nmight overtake them.\n\nAs we passed hurriedly through the palm gardens surrounding the castle I\nsaw its huge front doors were closed.\n\n\"Miela, we can't get in that way. A side entrance--or some other way--\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"There is a smaller door below, and others on the\nside.\"\n\nWe hastened on. Suddenly I gripped Miela by the arm.\n\n\"What's that--over there--see, beyond the grove?\"\n\nThere seemed to be furtive figures lurking among the palms.\n\n\"Those cannot be Baar's men, Miela--there are too many. What can it--\"\n\nWe had reached a little doorway under the front terrace. There was no time\nto investigate these advancing figures. Baar and his men might already be\ninside the castle.\n\nI slid through the doorway, every muscle tense. Miela had brought the\nknife from Baar's shack, and with it clenched in her hand was close beside\nme. I wanted to make her stay outside, where she could fly away if danger\nthreatened, but she pleaded to follow me, and I let her come. I needed\nher, since I had no idea of the interior arrangements of the building.\n\nWe passed along a dim hallway and up a narrow flight of stone steps. Not a\nsound came to us; the interior of the castle was silent as a tomb. At the\ntop of the steps we came almost directly into the inner patio of the\nbuilding. Across a bed of tall flowers, nodding gently in a little morning\nbreeze that swept down from above, I saw the head and shoulders of a man\nstanding in the center of the courtyard; the lower part of his body was\nhidden by the flowers. I tried to duck out of sight, but he had seen me.\n\nHe was not over forty feet away. I stepped back, believing I could reach\nhim in a single leap; but Miela held me.\n\n\"Not you, Alan. He would cry out. The noise would bring others.\" She\nraised her knife, and her eyes blazed into mine. \"Never have I thought to\nkill a human. But now I--a woman--must kill. Stand quiet, Alan.\"\n\nShe flew swiftly up and poised over the man. He had started toward us.\nEvidently he was, so far, as anxious for silence as we, for he made no\nsound. I saw now he was one of those who had come to Baar's shack. His\nnaked shoulders, his thick neck, and bullet head were all that showed\nabove the flower stems as he plowed his way through them directly toward\nme; but the hand he swung aloft to aid his progress held a knife.\n\nHe glanced up at Miela, poised in the air above him, and saw the weapon in\nher hand. At this new enemy he stopped, confused.\n\nMiela swooped down at him, and he struck at her with his knife; but she\navoided it with an incredibly swift turn, and a second later had passed\nhim and was crossing the courtyard.\n\nRound and round she flew, her great wings flapping audibly, a giant bird\ncircling its prey. The man turned continually to face her. Several times\nshe swooped toward him, and as swiftly avoided his blow. From every side\nshe threatened. The man stood now bewildered, striking wild in a frenzy,\nas one strikes at a darting wasp. At last, with an agonized cry, he turned\nand ran. Instantly she dropped upon him; there was a flash of her white\narm; the man's body crumpled and lay still among the flowers.\n\nMiela was back beside me. Her breast was heaving; her eyes were full of\ntears; she trembled.\n\n\"A terrible thing, Alan, my husband, for a woman to do; but it had to be.\"\n\nI pressed her hand with silent understanding.\n\n\"Come, Alan,\" she said. \"They will have heard his cry. The others--we must\nmeet them, too.\"\n\n\"We must get to the king. I--\"\n\nA vibrant scream rang out from the silence of the house--a man's voice,\nshrill with agony--then suddenly stilled.\n\n\"Good God, Miela! The king--where is he? Take me there.\"\n\nShe pulled me back through the doorway. A man scurried past. I leaped at\nhim and struck him a glancing blow with the heavy wooden pestle. He\nstumbled to his knees. Without thought of giving quarter, I hit him again\nbefore he could rise. He sank back, senseless or dead.\n\nMiela was ahead of me, and I ran after her along a hallway. The sound of\nscurrying footsteps sounded from overhead; a woman screamed.\n\nA broad, curving stairway fronted us. I passed Miela halfway up, and,\nreaching the top, ran full into another man who darted from a doorway\nclose by. The impact of my heavier body flung him backward to the floor. I\nleaped over him with a shout of warning to Miela, and ran on into the\nroom.\n\nA man was standing stock still in its center. It was Baar. He flung his\nknife at me as I appeared, but it went wild. Two other men were coming\ntoward me from opposite sides of the room. I swung the bludgeon about me\nviciously, keeping them away. Suddenly Baar shouted a command, and before\nI could reach any one of them they had scurried away like rats.\n\nA low bed with a huge canopy of silk stood against the wall. A woman knelt\non the floor beside it, and against her knees huddled a little half-grown\nboy.\n\nI heard Miela's voice shouting in her own language. The sound of men\nrunning came from below. Then Miela's half-hysterical laughter, and then\nthe words: \"They are running away, Alan--all of them. I have been calling\nyou to bring me the light-ray. And they are running away.\"\n\nI turned to the bed, pushing its curtains aside, and then hurriedly\nclosing them again with a shudder.\n\nMiela was beside me.\n\n\"The king is dead, Miela. No--you must not look.\"\n\nHer eyes widened; her hand went to her breast.\n\n\"There is one who needs you.\" I pointed to the woman on the floor.\n\nShe was staring at us, unseeing, one arm flung about the child\nprotectingly, holding him partially under one of her long, sleek red\nwings. The fingers of her other hand clutched convulsively at the bed\ncoverings; she was moaning softly with a grief and terror all the more\nintense because it was restrained.\n\n\"There is one who needs you, Miela,\" I repeated. \"Comfort her--for we have\ncome too late.\"\n\nThe castle now was in thorough confusion. Several waiting maids rushed\ninto the room, stared at their mistress and the little prince, and, seeing\nwhat had happened, stood silently wringing their hands in fright, or fled\naimlessly through the halls. One of the king's councilors had come in,\nstopping, bewildered, at the scene that met him.\n\n\"Tell him what has occurred, Miela,\" I said.\n\nThere came now faintly to my ears from outside the castle sounds of a\ngathering crowd--murmurs and vague muffled shouts. The cries grew louder.\nA rain of missiles struck the castle; a stone came through a near-by\nwindow, falling almost at my feet. All at once I remembered the lurking\nfigures we had seen among the palms in the garden.\n\n\"Miela!\" I cried. \"Hear that, outside! A crowd is gathering. The men we\nsaw--out there! People whom Baar has--Miela, ask him, for God's sake, to\ntell us how we can get weapons. Where are the other councilors? Send for\nthem. We must do something--now, at once. This is revolution, Miela--don't\nyou understand? Revolution!\"\n\nI felt so impotent. Here in this crisis I could talk to no one but\nMiela--could issue no direct commands--could understand the words of no\none but her.\n\nSuddenly, from over our heads, a great, solemn deep-throated bell began\ntolling.\n\n\"What is that? What does that mean?\"\n\nA girl rushed into the room.\n\n\"It is the bell of danger,\" said Miela quickly. \"The girls are ringing it\nto arouse the city. Up here then will the people hurry to find out what it\nis that threatens.\"\n\n\"They're outside now,\" I retorted. \"Order all the king's councilors here\nat once. Find out if any guards are about the place. Send them here. Where\nis the head of the city's police? Send him here to me! Tell him to call\nout all his men.\"\n\nWhat was I saying? I had forgotten the one vital thing!\n\n\"Miela! The light-ray! These men of science who guard it, where are they?\nSend for their leader. Get him here to me at once--we must have the ray!\"\n\nMiela stood very quietly beside me. Her face was white; her eyes blazed,\nbut she seemed calm and unfrightened.\n\n\"He will come,\" she said, \"and armed with the ray. The bell will bring\nhim. Your other commands I will see are obeyed.\"\n\nThe old councilor, who had been standing by, dazed, came slowly forward at\nMiela's call. The king's councilor! And all the others were like him. The\nking was dead, and here was the little prince huddled in his mother's arm!\nRealization had been slow in coming, but now it broke upon me like a great\nlight.\n\nI flung the bludgeon away from me, and stood erect.\n\n\"Miela,\" I cried, \"tell him--tell them all--their king is dead. It is _I_\nwho command now. There is no one else--and I have the power. Tell them\nthat. It is I, the man from earth, who commands!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nTHE NEW RULER.\n\n\nThe solemn bell continued pealing out its knell; the shouts and tumult\noutside were growing louder. Miela spoke hurriedly to the old man, then\nturned to leave the room.\n\n\"Your commands shall be obeyed, my husband,\" she said quietly.\n\nI felt again that sudden sense of helplessness as I saw her leave.\n\n\"Be careful, Miela. Order every one in the castle to the roof. Here! Tell\nthe queen before you go. Send every one up there with me. The mob may come\nin. We'll make our stand up there.\"\n\nI understood Baar's plot better now. He had gathered his mob of peons to\nsurround the castle and make a demonstration in his favor. Then, with the\nking dead and the queen and her little son held by him and his men--their\nlives as forfeits--he hoped to be able to treat with the men of science\nwho controlled the light-ray, and who, I did not doubt, represented the\nbetter element among the people.\n\nIt seemed a mad plan at best; and now that it had gone wrong, I wondered\nwhat Baar would attempt to do. Evidently he and his henchmen had all left\nthe castle, fearing the light-ray, which Miela pretended I held. They were\noutside now, among the mob, I assumed. Would the mob attempt to enter?\n\nMiela hurried away to send every one inside the building to its roof. The\nqueen, following Miela's commands unquestioningly, took the little prince\nby the hand and, signing to me to follow, led me upstairs.\n\nThere was only one stairway leading to the roof, I found with\nsatisfaction, and it was narrow--an excellent place for defense. The roof\nwas broad and flat, flanked at the ends by two towers which rose\nconsiderably above it.\n\nIt was a frightened little group who gathered about me--the queen and her\nson, two of the king's councilors, and perhaps half a dozen young girls\nwhom I took to be the queen's attendants. Others came up each moment.\n\nI sat the queen down on a little white stone bench in the center of the\ngarden, and bowed before her respectfully. Then I smiled upon them all. I\nthink they were reassured and trusted me, and I found my commands were\nobeyed without question.\n\nThe queen was a woman of perhaps thirty-five--tall and slender, with black\nhair and eyes. She was dressed in a single garment of heavy white silk, a\ndress that fell ungathered at the waist from above her breast under the\narms to her ankles. It was, I judged, her sleeping robe. Her hair hung in\ntwo long braids over her shoulders; her feet were incased in sandals.\n\nShe was unquestionably a beautiful woman. I remember my vague surprise, as\nI saw her, with her son by her side, and her long sleek wings unmutilated.\nAnd then I saw that her wings were fastened together in two places by\nlittle metal chains. She, then, like other married women, was not\npermitted to fly, although the beauty of her wings was unspoiled.\n\nI sent two of the old men to stand by the head of the stairs. Miela had\ngiven me her knife, and I handed it now to one of them, trying to make him\nunderstand that he was to bar the passage of any one who should not be\nallowed up. He shuddered, but he took the knife and stood where I\nindicated.\n\nThe crowd in the garden below had seen us on the roof now, and the tumult\nof shouts was doubled. I went to the parapet and looked over.\n\nThe garden was full of a struggling, confused mass of people. Those\nnearest the castle were mostly peons. I noticed men and a few women armed\nwith various implements of agriculture, and any sort of rude weapon they\ncould obtain. They were standing about in little groups or rushing\nexcitedly to and fro in aimless, uncommanded activity.\n\nMany of them held stones in their hands, which occasionally they cast at\nthe building. It was one of those mobs that gather ready for trouble, is\nswayed in almost any direction by any chance leadership, and most\nfrequently accomplishes nothing.\n\nI felt a sudden sense of relief. The garden was rapidly filling up with\nmen and women of the more intelligent classes, who mingled with the\nothers, learned what had occurred--for I did not doubt but that the\nknowledge of the king's death had spread about--and then stood waiting to\nsee what would happen.\n\nThe air was full of excited girls flying over the castle. A few alighted\nfor a moment on the roof, but I did not fear them. Where was Baar? I could\nnot hope to distinguish him among the crowd, but still I saw no sign of\nhis leadership. Had he seen the failure of his plan and, fearing the\nresults of his regicide, fled the vicinity? I hoped so fervently.\n\nAs I showed myself at the parapet a great shout arose. Some of the men--I\nknew at once it was those who had heard I possessed the\nlight-ray--scattered in terror at my appearance. I determined then, if no\nissue were raised that would demand my using this supposed weapon, I could\ncontinue to command the situation.\n\nI stood there a moment looking down. At the edge of the crowd I saw a few\nfigures whom I took to be members of the city's police. They were standing\nidle, taking no part in what was going on. There seemed nothing I could do\nuntil Miela returned. If only I could speak to the crowd! I wondered if I\ndared descend among them and disperse the mob of peons. I went to the head\nof the stairway. Three or four of the king's councilors were standing\nthere.\n\nThere was no one on the stairs; evidently every one living in the castle\nwas now on its roof--some thirty of them altogether. The crowd outside\nquite evidently had no present intention of entering the building. The mob\nof peons Baar had gathered were greatly in the minority now, and I felt\nthat matters were steadily improving. I wondered where Miela was, and then\nwhile I was standing there I saw her coming up the stairs, a man following\nclose behind her.\n\nI think I have never been so glad to see any one as I was to see her at\nthis moment. Her face was grave; her demeanor calm, as before.\n\n\"He is here,\" she said as she came to the head of the stairs. \"This is\nFuero, Alan, leader of the men of science, who have the ray.\"\n\nAs he came out onto the roof I saw this man was easily the most dominant\npersonality I had so far encountered on Mercury. He was tall for his race,\nalthough several inches shorter than I, a man of sixty, perhaps, with\niron-gray hair falling long about his ears.\n\nHe wore sandals and a pair of the usual knee-length, wide-cut trousers.\nBut what distinguished him in his dress was a broad panel of heavy silk,\nhanging from neck to knee, both in back and front, with an opening at the\ntop through which his head was thrust. This silken panel was some eighteen\ninches wide, light gray in color, and richly embroidered in gold in\nvarious designs. It hung free, except for a slight fastening at the waist\nline. Beneath it the man's naked torso--and his bare arms--showed\npowerfully muscled.\n\nHis face was smooth shaven, with strong, regular features. I noticed, too,\nthere was a slight cleft in his square chin. His forehead was high, his\nblue eyes kindly, yet with a searching, piercing quality about them.\n\nIt was not so much the man's general appearance as his bearing that made\nme realize he was a forceful character. There was about him unmistakable\npoise. I knew at once he felt his power, his authority. That he would use\nit wisely I could not doubt.\n\nHe stood regarding me gravely--an appraising regard under which I felt\nmyself flushing a little. Miela spoke to him swiftly, and he inclined his\nhead to me by way of introduction, his glance meanwhile taking in the\nscene on the roof.\n\nWith Miela as interpreter we held a hurried conversation. I learned then\nthat Fuero and his associates had many years before organized a society\nfor the development of the light-ray in its various forms. They had soon\nrealized in their experiments its diabolical power of destruction, and had\ntaken oath then that they would not use it, or allow it to be used, except\nunder the most critical circumstances of the nation's welfare.\n\nRealizing, too, the power it gave them as individuals, they had sworn to\nremain men of science only, taking no part in public affairs, remaining\nrigidly aloof from all national affairs. Most of their work concerned the\ndevelopment of the light-ray for industrial purposes. In these forms it\ndeveloped heat, but had very little power of projection.\n\nAll this Miela told me in a few brief sentences.\n\n\"How did Tao get the ray?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Some members of the society proved false,\" she answered. \"When Tao was\nbanished to the Twilight Country they deserted their brothers and joined\nhim. There were others with him of scientific mind, and these soon learned\nhow to make it, too.\"\n\nFuero was still regarding me appraisingly. I felt suddenly very young,\nvery inadequate as I stood there facing him. But I met his gaze squarely,\nand all at once he smiled.\n\n\"He says, 'Let us speak to the people,'\" said Miela.\n\nWe went to the parapet. Only a few moments had elapsed since I had stood\nthere before. The situation below was unchanged, except that the crowd had\ngrown denser.\n\nA sudden hush fell as they saw us. Fuero turned to me and spoke quietly;\nhis eyes seemed searching out my thoughts.\n\n\"He asks you, my husband, if you will take oath before your God to do what\nis right for our people. He wishes to trust you now in this crisis, for\nthere is no one else, and he believes in you.\"\n\n\"I will, Miela,\" I said solemnly. \"Before God I swear it.\"\n\nThe man gazed steadily into my eyes another instant, then abruptly he\nthrust a small metal cylinder into my hand. I thrilled as my fingers\nclosed around it. He seemed to hesitate, then he turned and, slowly\ncrossing the rooftop, looking neither to right nor left, he descended the\nstairs out of our sight.\n\nHe had done what he thought was best, and, having done it, had withdrawn\nimmediately from further participation in the affair.\n\nIt may have been the absence of his dominant personality, or the grasp of\nmy hand about this little metal cylinder, but now I felt a renewed sense\nof responsibility, and with it a feeling of power that swept aside all\ndoubts and all fears. Now I could command, could guide and control, the\ndestiny of this nation, and could, thank God, save my own world.\n\n\"Miela,\" I said, \"tell the queen her son shall be king. I am about to\nproclaim him king before the people, and I, as regent, will rule. Tell her\nthat, and bring him here now to me.\"\n\nThe queen made no answer, save a slight inclination of her head. But I saw\nthat she had recovered composure. She pushed her son gently away from\nher, and I strode forward to meet him.\n\n\"Tell him, Miela, he is a man now, and must have no fear, for he is the\ngreatest man in all this land.\"\n\nI patted his shoulder as he stood beside me, and he looked up into my face\nand smiled bravely.\n\nThe top of the parapet was flat and broad. I raised the little boy up and\nstood him upon it. Instantly another tumult of shouts arose.\n\nI looked down and saw the figure of Fuero as he stalked unheeding across\nthe garden, the people respectfully opening up a path before his advance.\n\nApproval and derision seemed mingled in the cries that greeted the\nappearance of the little prince.\n\n\"Quiet them if you can, Miela,\" I said. \"Speak to them.\"\n\nI steadied the boy with my hand, and he stood there unafraid, a sturdy,\nmanly little figure.\n\nMiela raised her voice and began speaking. The shouts partially ceased,\nthen suddenly a stone struck the parapet almost in front of us.\n\nA sudden rage possessed me. I fumbled at the cylinder I held. It was very\nmuch like a little hand flashlight, and seemed to have a knob at my thumb.\nMiela stopped speaking and turned to me.\n\n\"There--press that, Alan. Careful! Aim it there! See! Over there against\nthose palms.\"\n\nI held the thing up and pointed it toward the huge royal palms, aiming at\ntheir graceful fronds high over the heads of the people. My hand pressed\nthe knob; the little cylinder seemed to thrill in my grasp. A tiny beam of\nlight shot out-quite plainly visible--a green, shading into red. It struck\nthe palm branches, and silently yet rapidly, as though they were under\nsome giant blow-torch, they shriveled, crackled, and burst into flame.\n\nMiela's fingers bit into my arm. \"Enough, Alan! Stop!\"\n\nMy thumb yielded to the upward pressure of the tiny knob against it, and\nabruptly the light vanished. A narrow swath had been cut through the\npalms--a furrow of death plowed by the pressure of my thumb against a bit\nof metal!\n\nThe crowd had frozen into the immobility of terror. Now, as the dreaded\nray vanished as suddenly as it had sprung forth, they turned with cries of\nfright to escape. No one had been hurt. I shuddered as I realized now that\nmany girls had been in the air, and through no thought or skill of mine\nhad they escaped.\n\n\"Speak to them, Alan,\" Miela cried. \"There must be no panic. Here must\nthey stay and listen to what you have to say. Speak to them; stop them\nnow.\"\n\nI handed her the cylinder, lest the diabolical thing spit forth again its\nfire from my unskillful fingers, and leaped to the top of the parapet.\n\n\"Stop!\" I shouted at the top of my voice. \"Stop--all of you! At once!\"\n\nI waved my arms violently: I knew my words meant nothing, but my voice\ncarried far. The excitement continued. But a few stopped and stared at me;\nthen others, and gradually there was less confusion.\n\nMiela turned and shouted something to the girls on the rooftop. Instantly\nthey spread their wings and flew, down, circling close over the heads of\nthe people.\n\n\"Wait, Alan. A moment now and there will be quiet. The girls are telling\nthem not to fear, but to wait and listen to what you have to say.\"\n\nMiela stood now upon the parapet top, with the little prince between us.\nShe had concealed the tiny metal cylinder in her belt; her open palms were\nflung out before her, and her wings, spread and flapping slowly, raised\nher on tiptoe. Every line of her graceful body was tense; her attitude\nbespoke power, dominance, authority. And then she began to talk in a voice\nvibrant with emotion. Once she laid her hand lightly upon the curly head\nof the little boy, and a tremulous, uncertain cheer answered her from\nbelow.\n\n\"I have told them of the king's death, Alan,\" she said a moment later,\n\"and that here is their little king standing before them; And now, of\nyou--what shall I say?\"\n\n\"Tell them that until the king is older, I--the man from earth--shall rule\nthem as regent. Tell them if they obey me all will be well, for I shall\nrule them wisely.\"\n\nI stood while Miela translated this amid dead silence from the crowd. As\nshe finished I raised myself to full height and stared down at them\nthreateningly.\n\n\"But if there is trouble--if any one defies my authority--then, Miela,\ntell them I shall use the light-ray, for I shall brook no interference.\"\n\nThe silence from below continued.\n\nI spread my hands out before me and smiled.\n\n\"But there will be no trouble. I am with the Light Country, heart and\nsoul. Its interests are my interests, for I have married one of its women,\nand now I too am one of its people.\n\n\"Tao shall be overthrown--tell them that, Miela. The Twilight People never\nagain shall threaten our cities. If more land is wanted by our people of\nthe Light Country, tell them they shall have it. All the land they desire\nshall be theirs. For when Tao is vanquished I shall build great cars such\nas he is building, and all who wish may go to my earth peacefully, and we\nwill make them welcome as I have been made welcome here.\"\n\nA cheer arose as Miela translated this; and now for the first time I heard\nno cries of dissent.\n\n\"Say to them again I shall rule them wisely. Say I shall look to them--all\nof them, rich and poor alike--for help in what we have to do. All must\nhelp me, for I am only one, and I need them all. When this work we have to\ndo is over, when our nation is freed forever from this menace from across\nthe sea, tell them that then I will give my every thought to the details\nof their welfare. All that they wish--if it lays in my power--shall be\ndone.\"\n\nA girl alighted for an instant on the parapet near me; another, darted\ndownward in her flight, evidently to avoid the disrespect of passing\ndirectly in front of me. The thought flashed through my mind that I might\nmention the virgins and promise them reversal of the law they so abhorred,\nbut I felt it would be impolitic to raise that question at such a time as\nthis.\n\n\"Tell them now to leave the grounds, quietly,\" I concluded. \"When I wish\nthem again they will be sent for. All that I do will be known through\npublic proclamation.\"\n\nI lifted the little prince in my arms, and then, with the cheers of the\npeople ringing in my ears, jumped backward with him to the roof below.\n\nThus, by swift moving circumstances which could not have been foreseen,\nwas I made ruler of the Light Country. The crowd dispersed quietly. We\nsent the queen and her waiting maids back to her apartments, the aged\ncouncilors to theirs, and soon Miela and I were alone in one of the castle\nrooms.\n\nNow that the nervous excitement under which I had been laboring was over,\nI felt utterly exhausted. I dropped wearily into a seat, and Miela sat on\nthe floor at my feet with her arms on my knees.\n\nI stroked her glossy black hair idly.\n\n\"I'm tired, girl. I'm all in. Aren't you?\"\n\nWe had not slept since the afternoon before, and so much had happened\nsince.\n\nSuddenly I remembered Lua.\n\n\"Miela--your mother. We must find her.\" I started to my feet, then sat\ndown again.\n\nThere was no use of my rushing away on some aimless search over a city\nlike this.\n\n\"Where is the head of the city's police, Miela?\"\n\n\"I have sent for him. He should be here now to see you.\"\n\n\"I must have him search the city. Lua must be found. The castle guards--we\nmust appoint others, Miela. I must have a council, too--not doddering old\nmen, but others that we shall select. Who collects the taxes? Where is the\nmoney? Who handles it?\"\n\nThe questions piled upon me faster than I could voice them, and all the\nwhile my tired brain and weary, aching body called only for rest--for\nsleep.\n\nI thought of Mercer and Anina. They should be back by now.\n\n\"We must send home and have them told we are here, Miela. And that slave\nwoman of Baar's--she will be there, too. She must be sent here to us\nalso.\"\n\nWe had decided to live in the castle.\n\n\"When Mercer and Anina return, we must arrange to go to the Water City.\nThe disturbance there must be quelled. All the cities must be told of our\nactions here. I must visit them all, Miela.\"\n\nMy voice seemed trailing off as though I were talking to myself. A\nthousand problems rushed in confusion through my mind. I felt I was\ntalking almost incoherently. A knock on the door of our room brought me to\nmyself.\n\nA young girl stood respectfully on the threshold. Miela listened to what\nshe had to say, questioned her swiftly, and then turned to me. Her face\nhad gone suddenly white.\n\n\"The girls have returned from over the sea, Alan. This is one of them. But\nAnina and our friend Ollie have stayed there.\"\n\n\"Stayed there?\" I cried. \"Why?\"\n\n\"They set free Tao's men as we planned. They were on their way back when\nthe earth-man suddenly bid Anina return. Something was wrong, he said.\nThis girl does not understand what. But they went back. And Anina and\nOllie they left there, standing on the shore together. We are to go over\nto the same place to-night, if we can, and get them. That is all the girl\nknows.\"\n\nThe girl withdrew after a moment.\n\nMercer and Anina left in the Twilight Country! Miela and I stared at each\nother blankly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nIN THE TWILIGHT COUNTRY.\n\n\nMercer sat on the rear end of the platform and waved good-by vigorously as\nhe was carried swiftly up and out over the water. Under him was a pile of\nblankets and a coat, and beside him a box of baked dough-like bread--the\nfood he was to turn over to Tao's emissaries when he set them free.\n\nAnina flew at his side, at intervals smiling up at him reassuringly.\nBefore him on the platform his captives huddled. Although all of them were\ntrussed up securely, he menacingly kept his little wooden revolver pointed\nat them from the level of his knee.\n\nHe chuckled as he thought of the fight at the bayou. Everything was\nworking out all right; it was surprising what one could do with his\nphysical strength here on Mercury.\n\nThe girls had carried the platform up some five hundred feet above the\nsea. Mercer turned and looked back. The shore had already dropped almost\nto the rim of the close-encircling horizon. He leaned over toward Anina,\nresting one hand on the bamboo handle she was holding. \"How long will it\ntake us to get there, Anina?\"\n\nHe knew the girl would understand his words, but he did not realize she\nhad little basis for comparing time in his language.\n\n\"Long time,\" she answered, smiling. \"But we go quickly now.\"\n\nHe sat back again and waited. It seemed like hours--it _was_ hours\nprobably, three or four--and still they swept onward straight as an arrow.\n\nAfter another interminable interval Anina raised one hand and pointed\nahead.\n\n\"Twilight Country--there,\" she said.\n\nMercer saw, coming up over the horizon, the dim outlines of a rocky land\nsparsely covered with trees. It spread out rapidly before him as he\nwatched, fascinated. It seemed a desolate land, a line of low, barren\nhills off to one side, and a forest of stunted, naked-looking trees in\nfront. The platform swept on over the shore line, a rocky beach on which\nthe calm sea rolled up in tiny white lines of breakers. Then in a great\ncurve the girls circled to one side.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Mercer asked.\n\n\"A trail--near us somewhere. A trail to the Lone City. There we land.\"\n\nMercer saw the trail in a moment. It came out of the woods and struck the\nshore by a little bight where boats could land. The girls swooped\ndownward, and in a moment more the platform was lying motionless on the\nbeach.\n\nMercer looked around. It was light enough to see objects in the immediate\nforeground--a gray twilight. The forest came almost to the water's edge.\nHe saw now the trees might have been firs, but with small, twisted trunks,\nfew branches except near the top, and very few leaves. They seemed somehow\nvery naked and starved--indeed, it surprised him that they could grow at\nall in such a rocky waste. The end of the trail was close before him. It\nappeared merely an opening in the trees with the fallen logs and\nunderbrush cleared away.\n\nThe girls were obviously cold, standing idle now after their long flight.\nMercer lost no time in preparing for the return journey. He tumbled his\ncaptives unceremoniously off the platform and set the box of food and\nblankets beside them.\n\n\"What's this, Anina?\"\n\nHe was holding in his palm a tiny metal cylinder.\n\nAnina took it from him.\n\n\"For fire, see?\"\n\nShe picked up a bit of driftwood, and, holding the end of the cylinder\nagainst it, pressed a little button. A curl of smoke rose from the wood,\nand in a moment a wisp of flame.\n\n\"A light-ray!\" Mercer exclaimed.\n\n\"The ray--but different.\"\n\nShe tossed the blazing bit of wood aside, and held her hand a foot or so\nin front of the cylinder.\n\n\"No danger! See?\" She brought her hand closer. \"Heat here--close--no heat\nfar away.\"\n\nMercer understood then that this was not a light-ray projector, but a\nmethod of producing heat with the property of radiation, but not of\nprojection--a different and harmless form of the ray.\n\nHe took the little cylinder from the girl, inspected it curiously, then\nlaid it on the blankets.\n\n\"They'll need it, I guess, if it's any colder where they're going.\"\n\nHe set one of the captives free.\n\n\"Anina, tell him to sit quiet until we've gone. Then he can cut the others\nloose.\" He tossed a knife into the box. \"Come on, Anina; let's get away.\"\n\nThey were about ready to start back, when Mercer suddenly decided he was\nhungry. He hopped off the platform. \"They don't need all that food.\"\n\nHe gathered some of the little flat cakes of dough in his hands. \"Want\nsome?\" He offered them to the girls, who smilingly refused.\n\n\"All right. I do. I'm hungry. Might as well take a blanket, too. It's\ndevilish cold.\"\n\nHe was back on the platform in a moment, sitting down with the blanket\nabout his knees and munching contentedly at the bread.\n\n\"All right, Anina. Start her off.\"\n\nThey swung up into the air and began the return flight.\n\nA few hours more and they would be back at the Great City. Then the real\nwork would begin. Mercer squared his shoulders unconsciously as he thought\nof all there was to do.\n\nBut there was no danger to the Light Country from Tao, he thought with\nsatisfaction. At least, there would be none when the other cities were rid\nof Tao's men, as the Great City was now. The men would find their way back\nall right--\n\nAt the sudden thought that came to him Mercer dropped his bit of bread and\nsat up in astonishment. Tao no longer a menace? He remembered my reasoning\nin the boat coming down the bayou. Of course, Tao would have no reason to\nattack the Light Country by force of arms until he was sure his propaganda\namong the people had failed.\n\nMy argument was sound enough, but the utter stupidity of what we had done\nnow dawned on Mercer with overwhelming force. Tao would await the results\nof his emissaries' work, of course. And here we had gone and sent them\nstraight back to their leader to report their efforts a failure! If\nanything were needed to precipitate an invasion from Tao, this very thing\nMercer had just finished doing was it. He cursed himself and me fervently\nas he thought what fools we had been.\n\nThen it occurred to him perhaps it was not too late to repair the damage.\nNot more than half an hour had passed since he had set the men free on the\nshore of the Twilight Country. He must go back at once. Under no\ncircumstances must they be allowed to reach Tao and tell him what had\noccurred.\n\nAnina was flying near Mercer as before. He leaned over the edge of the\nplatform to talk with her, but the wind of their forward flight and the\nnoise of the girls' wings made conversation difficult.\n\n\"Anina! Come up here with me. Sit here. I want to talk to you. It's\nimportant. They don't need you flying now.\"\n\nObediently the girl sat where he indicated, close beside him. And then as\nhe was about to begin telling her what was in his mind Mercer suddenly\nremembered that they were still heading toward the Light Country, every\nmoment getting farther away from Tao's men, whose homeward journey he must\nhead off some way.\n\n\"We must go back, Anina--back where we came from--at once. Tell them--now!\nThen I'll tell you why.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes widened, but she did as he directed, and the platform,\nmaking a broad, sweeping turn, headed back toward the Twilight Country\nshore.\n\n\"Anina, how far is it to Tao's city from where we landed?\"\n\n\"The Lone City? A day, going fast.\"\n\n\"But they won't go fast, will they? Some of them are pretty badly hurt.\"\n\n\"Two days for them,\" the girl agreed.\n\nMercer then told her what an error we had made. She listened quietly, but\nhe knew she understood, not only his words, but the whole situation as he\nviewed it then.\n\n\"Most bad,\" she said solemnly when he paused.\n\n\"That's what I want to tell you; it's bad,\" he declared. \"We've got to\nhead them off some way; stop them somehow. I don't see how we're going to\ncapture them again--ten of them against me. But we've got to do\nsomething.\"\n\nThen he asked her about the lay of the country between the shore of the\nsea and the Lone City.\n\nAnina's English was put to severe test by her explanation; but she knew\nfar many more words than she had ever used, and now, with the interest of\nwhat she had to say, she lost much of the diffidence which before had\nrestrained her.\n\nShe told him that the trail led back through the forest for some distance,\nand then ran parallel with a swift flowing river. This river, she\nexplained, emptied into the Narrow Sea a few miles below the end of the\ntrail. It was the direct water route to the Lone City.\n\nThe trail, striking the river bank, followed it up into a mountainous\ncountry--a metallic waste where few trees grew. There was a place still\nfarther up in a very wild, broken country, where the river ran through a\ndeep, narrow gorge, and the trail followed a narrow ledge part way up one\nof its precipitous sides.\n\nAnina's eyes sparkled with eagerness as she told of it.\n\n\"There, my friend Ollie, we stop them. Many loose stones there are, and\nthe path is very narrow.\"\n\nMercer saw her plan at once. They could bar the men's passage somewhere\nalong this rocky trail, and with stones drive them back. He realized with\nsatisfaction that he could throw a stone fully twice as large and twice as\nfar as any of the men, and thus, out of range, bombard them until they\nwould be glad enough to turn back.\n\nHis plan, then, was to land, and with Anina follow the men. The rest of\nthe girls he would send back to me with the platform, to tell Miela and me\nto come over the next evening to the end of the trail.\n\nHe and Anina meanwhile would keep close behind the men, and then when the\nca\u00f1on was neared, get around in front of them, and bar their farther\nadvance. This would be easy since he could walk and run much faster than\nthey, and Anina could fly. He would drive them back out of the gorge, send\nAnina to keep the appointment with me and bring me up to him with the\ngirls and the platform.\n\nThey reached the shore and landed within a few feet of where they had been\nan hour before. The men were not in sight; nothing remained to show they\nhad been there, save pieces of cut cord lying about.\n\nAnina now instructed the girls what to tell me, and in a moment more, with\nthe blanket and a few pieces of bread, she and Mercer were left standing\nalone on the rocky beach. Anina was cold. He took off his fur jacket and\nwrapped it about her shoulders.\n\nShe made a quaint little picture standing there, with her two long braids\nof golden hair, and her blue-feathered wings which the jacket only partly\ncovered. They started up the trail together. It was almost dark in the\nwoods, but soon their eyes grew accustomed to the dim light, and they\ncould see a little better. They walked as rapidly, as Anina was able, for\nthe men had nearly an hour's start, and Mercer concluded they would be far\nahead.\n\nThey had gone perhaps a mile, climbing along over fallen logs, walking\nsometimes on the larger tree trunks lying prone--rude bridges by which the\ntrail crossed some ravine--when Anina said: \"I fly now. You wait here,\nOllie, and I find where they are.\"\n\nShe handed him the coat and flew up over the treetops, disappearing almost\nimmediately in the darkness. Mercer slung the coat around him and sat down\nto wait. He sat there perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes, staring up at the\nsilent, motionless treetops, and thinking all sorts of vague, impossible\ndangers impending. Then he heard her wings flapping and saw her flitting\ndown through the trees.\n\n\"Very near, they are,\" she said as soon as she reached the ground. \"A\nfire--they have--and they are ready now to sleep.\"\n\nThey went on slowly along the trail, and soon saw the glimmer of a fire\nahead. \"A camp for the night,\" whispered Mercer.\n\n\"It must be nearly morning now.\"\n\nHe looked about him and smiled as he realized that no light would come\nwith the morning. Always this same dim twilight here--and eternal darkness\non ahead. \"Good Lord, what a place to live!\" he muttered.\n\nThey crept on cautiously until they were within sight of the camp. A large\nfire was burning briskly. Most of the men were wrapped in their blankets,\napparently asleep; three were sitting upright, on guard. Mercer and Anina\ncrept away.\n\n\"We'd better camp, too,\" Mercer said when they were well out of hearing.\n\"They will probably stay there four or five hours, anyway. Lord, I'm\ntired.\" He laid his hand on her shoulder gently, almost timidly. \"Aren't\nyou tired, too, little girl?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered simply, and met his eyes with her gentle little smile.\n\"Oh, yes--I tired. Very much.\"\n\nThey did not dare light a fire, nor had they any means of doing so. They\nwent back from the trail a short distance, finding a little recess between\ntwo fallen logs, where the ground was soft with a heavy moss. Here they\ndecided to sleep for a few hours.\n\nA small pool of water had collected on a barren surface of rock near by,\nand from this they drank. Then they sat down, together and ate about half\nthe few remaining pieces of bread which Mercer was carrying in the pockets\nof his jacket. They were both tired out. Anina particularly was very\nsleepy.\n\nWhen they had finished eating Anina lay down, and Mercer covered her with\nthe blanket. She smiled up at him.\n\n\"Good night, Anina.\"\n\n\"Good night, my friend Ollie.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, snuggling closer under the blanket with a contented\nlittle sigh. Mercer put on his jacket and sat down beside her, his chin\ncupped in his hand. It seemed colder now. His trousers were thin, his legs\nfelt numb and stiff from his recent exertion.\n\nHe sat quiet, staring at the sleeping girl. She was very beautiful and\nvery sweet, lying there with her golden hair framing her face, her little\nhead pillowed on her arms, a portion of one blue-feathered wing peeping\nout from under the blanket. All at once Mercer bent over and kissed her\nlightly, brushing her lips with his, as one kisses a sleeping child.\n\nShe stirred, then opened her eyes and smiled up at him again.\n\n\"You cold, Ollie,\" she said accusingly. She lifted an edge of the blanket.\n\"Here--you sleep, too.\"\n\nHe stretched himself beside her, and she flung a corner of the blanket\nover him; and thus, like two children lost in the woods and huddled\ntogether for warmth under a fallen log, they slept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nANOTHER LIGHT-RAY!\n\n\nThe news that Mercer and Anina had been left in the Twilight Country\ncompletely dumfounded Miela and me. \"Something was wrong,\" Mercer had\nsaid. And then they had insisted on staying there, and had sent the girls\nback to tell me to come over.\n\nWe could make nothing of it, nor did the half hour of argument into which\nwe immediately plunged further enlighten us. That flaw in our plans which\nhad dawned on Mercer so suddenly and clearly certainly never occurred to\nus, for all it was seemingly so obvious.\n\nWe were interrupted--having reached no conclusion whatever except that we\nwould go over that evening as Mercer had directed--by the arrival of the\npolice chief to see me. He was a little man, curiously thin and wizened\nfor a Mercutian, with wide pantaloons, a shirt, short jacket and little\ntriangular cocked hat. His face seemed pointed, like a ferret. His\nmovements were rapid, his roving glance peculiarly alert.\n\nHe bowed before me obsequiously. He would obey me to the letter, I could\nsee that at once from his manner; though, had I impressed him as being\nlike my predecessor, I did not doubt but that he would do as he pleased\nupon occasion.\n\nI toyed with the little light-ray cylinder in my hand quite casually\nthrough the brief interview, and I saw he was thoroughly impressed, for he\nseemed unable to take his eyes from it.\n\n\"Where are your men just now?\" I asked.\n\nHe raised his hands deprecatingly and poured out a flood of words to Miela\nwhen my question was translated to him.\n\n\"He himself was sleeping,\" she said to me when he had paused for breath.\n\"His third watch was on patrol about the city. Then from the castle came\nthe king's guards, fleeing in haste. Those of the police they met they\ntold that evil men were in the castle with the light-ray, and all who\nrepresented the city's authority would be killed.\"\n\n\"That was a lie,\" I interrupted. \"There was no light-ray here then.\"\n\nMiela nodded. \"It was what Baar's men had told them to say, I think.\"\n\n\"And then what happened to the police?\"\n\n\"Then they left their posts about the city. Some fled; others went back\nand reported what they had heard.\"\n\n\"And it never occurred to any of them to come up here and try to stop the\ndisturbance? Curious policemen, these!\"\n\n\"It is too deadly--the light-ray,\" said Miela. \"They were afraid. And then\nthe alarm bell began ringing. They sent for Ano, here, to ask him what\nthey should do. And then you sent for him. He has his men at the police\nbuilding, in waiting. And he comes to you at the risk of his life, and now\nasks your commands.\"\n\nThus did my chief of police explain satisfactorily to himself, and with\ngreat protestations of loyalty to his trust, how it came about that he and\nhis men did nothing while their king was being murdered and another put in\nhis place.\n\nRecriminations seemed useless. He stood bowing and scraping before me,\neager only to obey my slightest wish.\n\n\"Tell him, Miela, how Baar's men captured Lua. Have the city, thoroughly\nsearched--Baar's house particularly. Tell him _I_ killed Baar's wife. Have\nthat slave woman sent home to me.\n\n\"Tell him to capture Baar and any of his known associates. If he does,\nhave him report to me at once. Say to him that I must have word of Lua--or\nI'll have a new chief of police by to-morrow. For the rest, have his men\npatrol the city as usual.\"\n\nI spoke as sternly as I could, and the little man received my words with\nvoluble protestations of extreme activity on his part.\n\nWhen he had bowed himself out I smiled at Miela hopelessly.\n\n\"This has got to be a mighty different government before we can ever hope\nto accomplish anything against Tao.\" Tao was not worrying me for the\nmoment. Lua must be found, and I had no idea of relying entirely upon this\nlittle chief of police to find her. And Mercer needed me, too, this very\nevening.\n\nI stood up wearily and put my arm about Miela's shoulders. Her little body\ndrooped against mine, her head resting on my shoulder. There was little\nabout us then, as we stood there dispirited and physically tired out, that\nwould have commended respect from our subjects.\n\n\"We _must_ get some sleep, Miela,\" I said. \"Things will look very\ndifferent to us then.\"\n\nIt must have been mid-afternoon when we awoke. Ano was at hand to report\nthat Baar and his men, and all the king's guards, must have fled the city.\nOf Lua he had, so far, found no trace. Baar's slave woman was in the\ncastle, waiting our commands. The girl who had brought us Mercer's message\nwas also waiting to ask us when we wanted her and the other girls for the\ntrip back to the Twilight Country.\n\n\"Right away,\" I exclaimed. \"I'm not going to take any chances with Mercer.\nWe'll start at once.\"\n\nThe girl flew away to get her friends and the platform, which had been\nleft in the garden of Miela's home. I planned to start openly from the\ncastle roof; there was now no need of maintaining secrecy.\n\nThe disappearance of Lua was alarming. Equally so was the possible danger\ninto which Mercer might have blundered. In Lua's case there did not seem\nmuch I could do personally at that moment. Before starting I arranged with\nthe aged councilors to call a meeting the following morning of all\ngovernment officials.\n\n\"Could we get Fuero to come, Miela?\"\n\nShe shook her head positively. \"His oath would forbid it.\"\n\n\"Well, tell the councilors to call also any of the city's prominent men.\nI've got to get some good men with me. I can't do it all alone.\"\n\nMiela smiled at me quizzically as I said this: \"You have forgotten our\nwomen and their help, my husband?\"\n\nI had, in very truth, for the moment.\n\n\"We'll need them, too,\" I said. \"Tell these girls who carry us to-night to\ncall all those who went with us to the mountains--a meeting to-morrow at\nthis time--here on the castle roof.\"\n\n\"To the Water City we must go,\" Miela said. \"There Tao's men are very\nstrong, our girls report. And to-day there was a fight among the people,\nand several were killed.\"\n\n\"But we must go armed, Miela, with more than one light-ray. I shall see\nthis Fuero to-morrow. After all, he's the key-note to the whole thing.\"\n\nWe started from the castle roof, Miela sitting with me this time on the\nplatform. Flying low, we passed over the maze of bayous, and in what\nseemed an incredibly short time we were out over the sea. I had now no\nidea what we might be called upon to do, or how long we would be gone, for\nall my specific plans for the next day; so we started as well prepared as\npossible.\n\nThe precious light-ray cylinder I held in my hand. We had a number of\nblankets, enough food for us all for two days of careful rationing, a\nknife or two, and a heavy, sharp-edged metal implement like an ax.\n\nIt seemed hardly more than half an hour before a great black cloud had\nspread over the whole sky, and we ran into the worst storm I have ever\nencountered. The wind came up suddenly, and we fought our way directly\ninto it. Lightning flashed about us, and then came the rain, slanting down\nin great sheets.\n\nWe were still flying low. The mirror surface of the sea was now lashed\nwith waves, extraordinarily high, whose white tops blew away in long\nstreaks of scud. The girls fought sturdily against the wind and rain,\ncarrying us steadily up until after a while I could not see the water\nbelow.\n\nWe were in the storm perhaps an hour altogether. Then we passed up and\nbeyond it; and emerged again into that gray vacancy, with a waste of\nstorm-lashed water far beneath us.\n\nThe Twilight Country shore was still below the horizon, and it was a\nconsiderable time before we sighted it. Miela and I sat quiet, wrapped in\na blanket, which, wet as it was, offered some protection against the\nbiting wind. The girls seemed exhausted from their long struggle against\nthe storm, and I was glad for them when we finally landed.\n\nThis was the place, they said, where Mercer and Anina had set Tao's men\nfree, and where the two were standing when the girls had left with the\nplatform. I looked about, and saw on the beach the pieces of cut cord with\nwhich the men had been bound.\n\nOf Mercer and Anina there was no sign. We waited until well after the time\nof the evening meal, and still Mercer and Anina did not arrive. We\nconcluded, of course, that they had followed Tao's men up the trail for\nsome reason, and we expected it would be Anina who would come back to tell\nus where Mercer was.\n\n\"Let us go up a little distance,\" Miela suggested finally. \"They cannot\ntell what the hour is. They may be near here now, coming back.\"\n\nThe girls were rested and warmed now, and we started off again with the\nplatform. We flew low over the treetops, following the trail as best we\ncould, but in the semi-darkness we could see very little from above. After\na time we gave it up and returned to the shore.\n\nAgain we waited, now very much alarmed. And then finally we decided to\nreturn to the Great City for the night. Anina might have missed us some\nway, we thought, and flown directly home. She might be there waiting for\nus when we arrived. If not, we would return again with several hundred\ngirls, and with them scour the country carefully back as near the Lone\nCity as we dared go.\n\nWith our hearts heavy with apprehension we started back across the\nchannel. Lua, Mercer and Anina were separated from us. All had been\ncaptured, perhaps, by our enemies! Things were, indeed, in a very bad way.\n\nWithout unusual incident we sighted the Light Country shore. Three girls\nwere winging their way swiftly toward us.\n\n\"They wish to speak with us, Alan,\" said Miela. \"From the Great City they\nseem to come. Perhaps it is Anina.\"\n\nOur hopes were soon dispelled, for Anina was not one of them; they were\nthree of the girls we had directed to patrol the seacoast.\n\nWhen they neared us Miela flew off the platform and joined them. They\ncircled about for a time, flying close together, then Miela left them and\nreturned to me, while they hovered overhead. Her face was clouded with\nanxiety as she alighted beside me.\n\n\"They were near the Water City a short time ago. And they say the\nlight-ray is being used there. They saw it flashing up, and dared not go\ncloser.\"\n\nThe light-ray in the Water City! My heart sunk with dismay. The cylinder I\nheld in my hand I had thought the only one in use in all the Light\nCountry. With it I felt supreme. And now they had it also in the Water\nCity!\n\nOne of the girls flung up her hand suddenly and called to Miela.\n\n\"See, Alan--a boat!\"\n\nI looked down to where Miela pointed. The sea was still rough from the\nstorm, but no longer lashed into fury. Coming toward us, close inshore and\nfrom the direction of the Water City, I saw a boat speeding along over the\nspent waves. And as I looked, a narrow beam of light, green, shading into\nred, shot up from the boat and hung wavering in the air like a little\nsearch-light striving to pierce the gray mist of the sky!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nTHE THEFT OF THE LIGHT-RAY.\n\n\nThe touch of soft, cool hands on his face brought Mercer back to sudden\nconsciousness. He opened his eyes; Anina was sitting beside him, regarding\nhim gravely.\n\n\"Wake up, my friend Ollie. Time now to wake up.\"\n\nHe sat up, rubbing his eyes. The same dim twilight obscured everything\naround. For an instant he was confused.\n\n\"Why, I've been asleep.\" He got to his feet. \"Do you think it's been long,\nAnina? Maybe the men have started off. Let's go see.\"\n\nAnina had already been to see; she had awakened some little time before\nand, leaving Mercer asleep, had flown up ahead over the treetops.\n\nThe men were just then breaking camp, and she had returned to wake up\nMercer. They ate their last remaining pieces of bread, drank from the\nlittle pool of water, and were soon ready to start on after their quarry.\n\n\"How long will it take them to reach the gorge, Anina?\"\n\n\"Not very long--four times farther reach Lone City.\"\n\nBy which Mercer inferred that within three or four hours, perhaps, they\nwould be at the place where they hoped to turn the men back.\n\nThey started off slowly up the trail, Mercer carrying the folded blanket,\nand Anina wearing the fur jacket. They soon came upon the smoldering fire\nthat marked the other party's night encampment. The men were, Mercer\njudged, perhaps a mile or so ahead of them.\n\nThey continued on, walking slowly, for they did not want to overtake the\nslow-traveling men ahead. The look of the country, what they could see of\nit in the darkness, was unchanged. The trail seemed bending steadily to\nthe right, and after a time they came to the bank of a river which the\ntrail followed. It was a broad stream, perhaps a quarter of a mile across,\nwith a considerable current sweeping down to the sea.\n\nThey kept to the trail along the river bank for nearly another hour. Then\nAnina abruptly halted, pulling Mercer partly behind a tree trunk.\n\n\"Another fire,\" she whispered. \"They stop again.\"\n\nThey could see the glow of the fire, close by the river bank among the\ntrees. Very cautiously they approached and soon made out the vague\noutlines of a boat moored to the bank. It seemed similar to the one in\nwhich they had come down the bayous from the Great City, only slightly\nlarger.\n\n\"Other men,\" whispered Anina. \"From Lone City.\"\n\nMercer's heart sank. A party from the Lone City--more of Tao's men to join\nthose he had set free! All his fine plans were swept away. The men would\nall go up to the Lone City now in the boat, of course. There was nothing\nhe could do to stop them. And now Tao would learn of the failure of his\nplans.\n\nMercer's first idea was to give up and return to the shore of the sea; but\nAnina kept on going cautiously forward, and he followed her.\n\nThe fire, they could see as they got closer, was built a little back from\nthe water, with a slight rise of ground between it and the boat. There\nwere some thirty men gathered around; they seemed to be cooking.\n\n\"You stand here, Ollie,\" Anina whispered. \"I go hear what they say. Stand\nvery quiet and wait. I come back.\"\n\nMercer sat down with his back against a tree and waited. Anina disappeared\nalmost immediately. He heard no sound of her flight, but a moment later he\nthought he saw her dropping down through the trees just outside the circle\nof light from the fire. From where he was sitting he could see the boat\nalso; he thought he made out the figure of a man sitting in it, on guard.\nThe situation, as Mercer understood it from what Anina told him when she\nreturned, seemed immeasurably worse even than he had anticipated.\n\nTao had been making the Water City the basis of his insidious propaganda,\nrather than the Great City, as we had supposed. He had been in constant\ncommunication by boat with his men in the Water City; and now affairs\nthere were ripe for more drastic operations.\n\nThis boat Mercer had come upon was intended to be Tao's first armed\ninvasion of the Light Country--some twenty of his most trusted men armed\nwith the light-ray. Joining his emissaries in the Water City, and with the\nlarge following among the people there which they had already secured,\nthey planned to seize the government and obtain control of the city. Then,\nusing it as a base, they could spread out for a conquest of the entire\nnation. Mercer listened with whitening face while Anina told him all this\nas best she could.\n\n\"But--but why does he want to attack the Light Country, Anina? I thought\nhe wanted to go and conquer our earth.\"\n\n\"Very big task--your earth,\" the girl answered. \"Light Country more easy.\nMany light-rays in the Great City. Those he needs before he goes to your\nearth. More simple to get those than make others.\"\n\nMercer understood it then. The large quantity of light-ray ammunition\nstored in the Great City was what Tao was after. This was his way of\ngetting it, and once he had it, and control of the Light Country besides\nhe would be in a much better position to attack the earth.\n\nThe idea came to Mercer then to steal the boat and escape with it. If he\ncould do that, the enemies would have to return to the Lone City on foot,\nand the threatened invasion of the Light Country would thus be postponed\nfor a time at least. Meanwhile, with the boat he could hasten back to me\nwith news of the coming invasion.\n\nThese thoughts were running through his head while Anina was talking. It\nwas a daring plan, but it might be done. There was apparently only one man\nin the boat, and the slight rise of ground between it and the fire made\nhim out of sight, though not out of hearing, of the others.\n\n\"Can you run the boat, Anina?\"\n\nThe girl nodded eagerly. Mercer drew a long breath.\n\n\"We'll take a chance. It's the only way. They've got that cursed\nlight-ray.\" He shivered as he thought of the danger they were about to\ninvite.\n\nThen he explained to Anina what they were to do. She listened carefully,\nwith the same expectant, eager look on her face he had seen there so often\nbefore.\n\nThey left the blanket and fur jacket on the ground, and, making a wide\ndetour around the fire, came back to the river bank several hundred yards\nabove the boat. They stood at the water's edge, looking about them. The\nboat was just around a slight bend in the stream; the glimmer of the fire\nshowed plainly among the trees. Intense quiet prevailed; only the murmur\nof the water flowing past, and occasionally the raised voice of one of the\nmen about the fire, broke the stillness.\n\nMercer stared searchingly into the girl's eyes as she stood there quietly\nat his side. She met his gaze steadily.\n\n\"You're a wonderful little girl,\" he whispered to her, and then abruptly\nadded: \"Come on. Don't make any splash if you can help it. And remember,\nif anything goes wrong, never mind me. Fly away--if you can.\"\n\nThey waded slowly into the water. The current carried them rapidly along.\nSide by side, with slow, careful strokes, they swam, keeping close to\nshore. The river was shallow--hardly over their heads. The water was cold\nand, Mercer thought, curiously buoyant.\n\nIt seemed hardly more than a moment before the shadowy black figure of\noutlines of the boat loomed ahead. They could make out the figure of its\nsingle occupant, sitting with his arm on the gunwale. They swam hardly at\nall now, letting the current carry them forward. As silent as two drifting\nlogs they dropped down upon the boat and in another moment were clinging\nto a bit of rope that chanced to be hanging over its stern.\n\nThe bow of the boat was nosed against the bank; it lay diagonally\ndownstream, with its stern some twenty feet from shore. Its occupant was\nsitting amidships, facing the bow. Mercer drew himself up until his eyes\nwere above the stern of the boat and saw him plainly. He was slouching\ndown as though dozing. His elbow was crooked, carelessly over the gunwale.\n\nMercer's heart gave an exultant leap as he saw a little cylinder in the\nman's hand. There was a little projection on the boat at the water line,\nand, working along this with his hands, Mercer edged slowly toward the\nman. He knew he could not be heard, for the murmur of the water slipping\npast the sides of the boat drowned the slight noise he made.\n\nHe edged his way along, with not much more than his face out of water,\nuntil he was directly beneath the motionless form in the boat.\n\nMercer's heart was beating so it seemed to smother him. Slowly he pulled\nhimself up until the fingers of his left hand gripped the gunwale hardly\nmore than a foot or two behind the man's back. His other hand reached\nforward. He must have made a slight noise, for the man sat suddenly\nupright, listening.\n\nMercer's right hand shot out. His fingers closed over the little cylinder\nand the hand holding it. He bent it inward, twisting the man's wrist. His\nthumb fumbled for the little button Anina had described. There was a tiny\npuff of light; the man's body wavered, then fell forward inert. Mercer\nclimbed into the boat. He looked back. Anina was pulling herself up over\nthe stern. A long pole lay across the seats. He picked it up and started\nwith it toward the bow. And then he tripped over something and fell\nheadlong, dropping the pole with a clatter.\n\nAs he picked himself up there came a shout from the men in the woods.\nMercer hurried forward and cast off the rope that held the boat to the\nbank. It had been tied more or less permanently at this end. As he fumbled\nat the knots he heard Anina's soft, anxious voice calling: \"Hurry, Ollie,\nhurry!\"\n\nThe shouts from the woods continued. The knots loosened finally. The boat\nslid back away from the bank; with the pole Mercer shoved the bow around.\nAn instant later Anina had started the mechanism, and in a broad curve\nthey swung silently out into the river.\n\nUp from the woods shot a beam of the greenish-red light. It darted to and\nfro for an instant, almost vertically in the air, and Mercer heard the\ncrackle of the tree-tops as they burst into flame under its heat. Then it\nswung downward, but before it could reach the water level the rise of\nground at the bank cut it off.\n\nWithout realizing it, Mercer had been holding his breath as he watched.\nNow he let it out with a long sigh of relief.\n\n\"We did it, Anina--we did it,\" he said exultantly. \"And we've got a\nlight-ray, too.\"\n\nA moment later they swept around a bend in the river, out of sight and out\nof hearing of their enemies.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nTHE STORM.\n\n\nOn the little stern seat of the boat Mercer and Anina sat side by side,\nthe girl steering by a small tiller that lay between them. They were well\nout in the middle of the river now, speeding silently along with its swift\ncurrent. They made extraordinary speed. Both banks of the river were\nvisible in the twilight--dim, wooded hills stretching back into darkness.\n\nThe stream widened steadily as they advanced, until near, its mouth it had\nbecome a broad estuary. They followed its right shore now and soon were\nout in the Narrow Sea.\n\n\"We'd better go right on across,\" said Mercer. \"It's too early for Alan to\nbe at the end of the trail. He won't be there till to-night. We can reach\nthe Great City before he starts.\"\n\nThey decided to do that, and headed straight out into the sea. They had\nbeen cold, sitting there in the wind, and wet to the skin. But the boat\ncontained several furry jackets, which the men had left in it, and in the\nbottom, near the stern, a cubical metal box which lighted up like an\nelectric radiator. By this they had dried and warmed themselves, and now,\neach with a fur jacket on, they felt thoroughly comfortable.\n\nMercer was elated at what they had accomplished. He could see now how\nfortunate a circumstance it was that we had set the men free. He would not\nhave stumbled upon this other party, and the invasion of the Light Country\nwould have begun, had we not released them.\n\nHe talked enthusiastically about what we were to do next, and Anina\nlistened, saying very little, but following his words with eager\nattention. Once he thought she was more interested in the words themselves\nthan in what he was saying, and said so.\n\n\"Your language--so very easy it is. I want to learn it soon if I can.\"\n\n\"Why, you know it already,\" he protested. \"And how the deuce you ever got\nit so quickly beats me.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"When you say words--very easy then for me to remember. Not many words in\nspoken language.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Well, however you do it, the result's all right. I'm mighty glad, too.\nWhy, when I get you back home on earth--\" He stopped in sudden confusion.\n\nShe put her hand on his arm.\n\n\"Miela says your earth is very wonderful. Tell me about it.\"\n\nShe listened to his glowing words. \"And opera--what is that?\" she asked\nonce when he paused.\n\nHe described the Metropolitan Opera House, and the newer, finer one in\nBoston. She listened to his description of the music with flushed face and\nshining eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful--that music! Can _you_ sing, Ollie?\"\n\n\"No,\" he admitted, \"but I can play a little on a guitar. I wish I had one\nhere.\"\n\n\"I can sing,\" said the girl: \"Miela says I can sing very well.\"\n\nHe leaned toward her, brushing the blue feathers of her wing lightly with\nhis hand.\n\n\"Sing for me,\" he said softly. \"I'll bet you sing beautifully.\"\n\nIt may have been their situation, or what they had been through together,\nor the girl's nearness to him now with her long braids of golden hair, the\ngraceful sweep of her blue-feathered wings that matched the blue of her\neyes, her red lips parted in song--but whatever it was, Mercer thought he\nhad never heard so sweet a voice. She sang a weird little song. It was in\na minor key, with curious cadences that died away and ended nowhere--the\nfolk song of a different race, a different planet, yet vibrant with the\never unsatisfied longing of the human soul.\n\nShe sang softly, staring straight before her, without thought of her\nsinging, thinking only of her song. She ended with a tender phrase that\nmight have been a sigh--a quivering little half sob that died away in her\nthroat and left the song unfinished. Her hands were folded quiet in her\nlap; her eyes gazed out on the gray waste of water about the boat.\n\nMercer breathed again.\n\n\"That is beautiful, Anina. What is it?\"\n\nShe turned to him and smiled.\n\n\"Just love song. You like it, my friend Ollie?\"\n\n\"It's wonderful. But it's--it's so sad--and--and sort of weird isn't it?\"\n\n\"That is love, my mother says. Love is sad.\"\n\nMercer's heart was beating fast.\n\n\"Is it always sad, Anina? I don't think so--do you?\"\n\nThere was no trace of coquetry in her eyes; she sighed tremulously.\n\n\"I do not know about love. But what I feel here\"--she put her hand on her\nbreast--\"I do not understand, Ollie. And when I sing--they are very sad\nand sweet, the thoughts of music, and they say things to the heart that\nthe brain does not understand. Is it that way with you?\"\n\nUnnoticed by the two, a storm cloud had swept up over the horizon behind\nthem, and the sky overhead was blotted now with its black. They had not\nseen it nor heeded the distant flashing of lightning. A sudden thunderclap\nstartled them now into consciousness of the scene about them. The wind\nrushed on them from behind. The sea was rising rapidly; the boat scudded\nbefore it.\n\n\"A storm! Look at it, Anina, behind us!\"\n\nThere was nothing in sight now but the gray sea, broken into waves that\nwere beginning to curl, white and angry. Behind them the darkness was\nsplit with jagged forks of lightning. The thunder rolled heavily and\nominously in the distance, with occasional sharp cracks near at hand.\n\n\"Look, Anina--there comes the rain! See it there behind us! I hope it\nwon't be a bad storm. I wouldn't want to be out in this little tub.\"\n\nThe wind veered to the left, increasing steadily. The sea was lashed into\nfoam; its spray swept over the boat, drenching them thoroughly.\n\nThe waves, turning now with the wind, struck the boat on its stern\nquarter. One curled aboard, sloshing an inch or two of water about the\nbottom of the boat. Mercer feared it would interfere with the mechanism,\nbut Anina reassured him.\n\nAs the waves increased in size, Mercer swung the boat around so as to run\ndirectly before them. The stern frequently was lifted clear of the water\nnow, the boat losing headway as a great cloud of hissing steam arose from\nbehind.\n\nAfter a time the Light Country shore came into sight. They were close upon\nit before they saw it through the rain and murk. They seemed to be heading\ndiagonally toward it.\n\n\"Where are we, Anina?\" Mercer asked anxiously.\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\nSteadily they were swept inward. The shore line, as they drew closer, was\nto Mercer quite unfamiliar. There were no bayous here, no inundated land.\nInstead, a bleak line of cliffs fronted them--a perpendicular wall against\nwhich the waves beat furiously. They could see only a short distance. The\nline of cliffs extended ahead of them out of sight in the gray of the\nsheets of rain.\n\nThey were slanting toward the cliffs, and Mercer knew if he did not do\nsomething they would be driven against them in a few moments more.\n\n\"We'll have to turn out, Anina. We can't land along here. We must keep\naway if we can.\"\n\nWith the waves striking its stern quarter again, the boat made much\nheavier weather. It seemed to Mercer incredible that it should stay\nafloat. He found himself thoroughly frightened now, but when he remembered\nthat Anina was in no danger he felt relieved. He had made her lie down in\nthe boat, where she would be more sheltered from the wind and rain. Now he\nhastily bade her get up and sit beside him.\n\n\"We might be swamped any minute, Anina. You sit there where you won't get\ncaught if we go over.\"\n\nThey swept onward, Mercer keeping the boat offshore as best he could.\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where we are, Anina? How far along do these cliffs\nextend?\"\n\nA huge, jagged pinnacle of rock, like a great cathedral spire set in the\ncliff, loomed into view ahead. Anina's face brightened, when she saw it.\n\n\"The way to the Water City,\" she cried. \"A river there is--ahead. Not so\nvery far now.\"\n\nIn spite of all Mercer could do, they were blowing steadily closer to the\nwave-lashed cliffs.\n\nHe began to despair. \"If anything happens, Anina--you fly up at once. You\nhear? Don't you wait. You can't help me any. I'll make out some way. You\nsay good-by to Alan and your mother and sister for me--if--\" He fell\nsilent a moment, then said softly: \"And, Anina, if that should happen, I\nwant you to know that I think you're the sweetest, most wonderful little\ngirl I ever met. And, Anina dear--\"\n\nThe girl gripped his arm with a cry of joy.\n\n\"See, Ollie! There, ahead, the cliffs end. That is the Water City river!\nSee it there?\"\n\nThe mouth of a broad estuary, with the waves rolling up into it, came\nswiftly into view. They rounded the rocky headland and entered it, running\nnow almost directly before the wind. The river narrowed after a short\ndistance to a stream very much like the one they had left in the Twilight\nCountry.\n\nMercer turned to the quiet little girl beside him.\n\n\"Well, Anina, we've certainly had some trip. I wouldn't want to go through\nit again.\"\n\nMercer thought the situation over. They could stay where they were in the\nriver for an hour or two until the storm was entirely over, and then go\nback to the Great City. On the other hand, now that they were here, Mercer\nfelt a great curiosity to see this other city where Tao's men had created\ntrouble. Why should they not use these few hours of waiting to see it?\n\n\"We might get a line on how things stand up there to tell Alan when we get\nback,\" Mercer said when he explained his ideas to Anina. \"It won't take\nlong.\" Very probably it was the light-ray cylinder in his hand which\ninfluenced his decision, for he added: \"We can't get into any trouble, you\nknow; there's no light-ray here yet.\"\n\nAnd so they went on.\n\nThere was a perceptible current coming down the river. The water was cold\nand clear, and in the brighter light now he could see down into it in many\nplaces to the bottom, six or eight feet below. The region seemed utterly\nuninhabited; no sign of a house or even a boat on the river met them as\nthey advanced.\n\n\"Mightn't there be boats along here?\" Mercer asked once. \"How far up _is_\nthis place?\"\n\n\"Not far now--beyond there.\"\n\nThe river appeared to terminate abruptly up ahead against the side of a\nfrowning brown cliff, but Mercer saw a moment later that it opened out\naround a bend to the left.\n\n\"Around that next bend?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\nIt seemed incredible to Mercer that the second largest city in Mercury lay\nhidden in the midst of this desolation.\n\n\"We'll meet boats,\" he said. \"What will the people think of me? Don't\nlet's start anything if we can help it.\"\n\n\"You lie there.\" Anina indicated the bottom of the boat at her feet. \"No\none see you then. I steer. They do not notice me. Nobody care who I am.\"\n\nMercer had still the very vaguest of ideas as to what they would do when\nthey got to the Water City. As a matter of fact, he really was more\ncurious just to see it than anything else. But there was another reason\nthat urged him on. Both he and Anina were hungry.\n\nThey had eaten very little since leaving the Great City the night before;\nand now that it was again evening, they were famished. They had rummaged\nthe boat thoroughly, but evidently the men had taken all their supplies\nashore with them, for nothing was in the boat.\n\n\"We'll have to dope out some way to get something to eat,\" said Mercer.\n\nThey came upon the sharp bend in the river Anina had indicated. Following\nclose against one rocky shore, they swept around the bend, and the Water\nCity lay spread out before Mercer's astonished eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nTHE WATER CITY.\n\n\nIt had stopped raining; the sky overhead was luminous with diffused\nsunlight; the scene that lay before Mercer was plainly visible. The river\nhad opened abruptly into a broad, shallow, nearly circular lake, some five\nor six miles across. The country here showed an extraordinary change from\nthat they had passed through. The lake appeared to occupy a depression in\nthe surrounding hills, like the bottom of a huge, shallow bowl. From the\nwater's edge on all sides the ground sloped upward. It was no longer a\nbarren, rocky land, but seemingly covered with a rich heavy soil, dotted\nwith tropical trees. That it was under a high state of cultivation was\nevident. Mercer saw tier upon tier of rice terraces on the hillsides.\n\nBut what astonished him most was the city itself. It covered almost the\nentire surface of the lake--a huge collection of little palm-thatched\nshacks built upon platforms raised above the water on stilts. Some of the\nhouses were larger and built of stone, with their foundations in the\nwater.\n\nOff to one side were two or three little islands, an acre or less in\nextent, fringed with palms and coconut trees. In nearly the center of the\nlake stood a stone castle, two stories in height, with minarets\nornamenting its corners. An open stretch of water surrounded it.\n\nThere was little of regularity about this extraordinary city, and no\nevidence of streets, for the houses were set down quite haphazard wherever\nopen space afforded. In some places they were more crowded together than\nothers, although seldom closer than twenty or thirty feet.\n\nAround the larger ones there was a little more open water, as though the\nowners controlled it and forbade building there. Some of the smaller\nhouses were connected by little wooden bridges. Anina said this was where\ntwo or more families of relatives had located together.\n\nThere were a few boats moving about--little punts hollowed out of logs and\npropelled by long poles--and Mercer saw many others, some of them larger\nlike the one he and Anina were in, tied up by the houses. It was now the\ntime of the evening meal. The workers had returned from the terraces;\nthere were few moving about the city. Occasionally a girl would dart up\nfrom one of the houses and wing her way to another, but beyond that there\nwere no signs of activity.\n\nAnina took command of the boat now, slowing it down and heading for the\nnearest of the houses, which were hardly more than quarter of a mile away.\nMercer stretched himself out in the bottom of the boat, covering himself\nwith a large piece of fabric that lay there. He felt that he would be\nunnoticed, even should a girl chance to pass directly overhead. But he\ncould see nothing of the city from where he was, and soon grew restless\nand anxious to do something else.\n\n\"I'm coming up, Anina,\" he said once. \"Shucks! Nobody can do anything to\nus. Haven't I got this light-ray?\"\n\nBut Anina was obdurate, and made him stay where he was.\n\nThey went slowly forward and were soon among the houses. On the front\nplatform of one a man sat fishing. A little naked boy slid down into the\nwater from another, swimming as though born to the water. Both stared at\nAnina curiously as she passed slowly by, but they said nothing. A girl\nlooked out of the window of another house and waved her hand in friendly\ngreeting, which Anina answered.\n\nMercer, lying with all but his face covered by the cloth, could see only\nthe sides of the boat, the bottom of the cross-seat over his head, and\nAnina as she sat above him in the stern.\n\n\"Where do you suppose the Tao people hang out around here?\" he suddenly\nasked. \"If we could--\"\n\nThe girl silenced him with a gesture.\n\nHe lowered his voice. \"Try and find out where they are, Anina,\" he\nwhispered.\n\nAnina steered the boat directly under several of the houses, which must\nhave been quite a usual proceeding, for it attracted no attention. A girl\nflew close to them once, and Anina called to her. The girl alighted on the\nstern of the boat for a moment; Mercer slid the cloth over his face and\nheld himself motionless. Then he heard Anina's voice calling to him\nsoftly. He slid the cloth back; the girl had gone.\n\n\"She says Tao's men live, there--large house, of wood,\" said Anina,\npointing off to one side.\n\nMercer nearly rapped his head against the seat above him in his\nexcitement.\n\n\"You know which house? Let's go there. Maybe we can hear what they're\nsaying. Can we get under it?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Let's try, Anina,\" he said eagerly. \"You steer us slow right under it,\njust as if you were going past. If there's nobody in sight you can stop\nunderneath, can't you? Maybe we can hear what they're saying.\"\n\n\"I try,\" the girl said simply.\n\n\"I'll lay still,\" encouraged Mercer. \"Nobody will bother about you. Just\nsneak in and see what happens. If anybody sees you, keep going.\"\n\nHe was all excitement, and in spite of Anina's protests wriggled about\ncontinually, trying to see where they were.\n\nThe house that the girl had pointed out lay only a few hundred yards\nahead. It was one of the largest of the wooden buildings--sixty or seventy\nfeet long at least--single story, with a high sloping thatched roof.\n\nIt was raised on a platform some six feet above the water, which, in\nfront, had a little flight of wooden steps leading down to the surface.\nThere was a hundred feet of open water on all sides of the building. The\nboat, moving slowly, slipped through the water almost without a sound.\n\n\"Where are we now?\" Mercer whispered impatiently. \"Aren't we there yet?\"\n\nThe girl put a finger to her lips. \"Almost there. Quiet now.\"\n\nShe steered straight for the house. There was no one in sight, either\nabout the house itself or about those in its immediate vicinity. A moment\nmore and the boat slid beneath the building into semidarkness.\n\nAnina shut the power off and stood up. The floor of the house was just\nabove her head. In front of her, near the center of the building, she saw\nthe side walls of an inner inclosure some twenty feet square. These walls\ncame down to the surface, making a room like a basement to the dwelling. A\nbroad doorway, with a sliding door that now stood open, gave ingress.\n\nThe boat had now almost lost headway. Anina nosed its bow into this\ndoorway, and grasping one of the pilings near at hand, brought it to rest.\n\nMercer, at a signal from her, climbed cautiously to his feet, still\nholding the little light-ray cylinder in his hand.\n\n\"What's that in there?\" he whispered.\n\nBeyond the doorway, through which the bow of the boat projected, there was\ncomplete darkness.\n\n\"Lower room,\" Anina whispered back. \"Store things in there. And boat\nlanding, too.\"\n\n\"Let's go in and see.\"\n\nMercer started toward the bow of the boat. Six feet or more of it was\ninside the doorway. He made his way carefully into the bow, and found\nhimself inside the basement of the house.\n\nIn the dimness of this interior he could just make out the outlines of\nthings around. The doorway was located at a corner of the inclosure. In\nfront lay a small open space of water. At one side a platform about two\nfeet above the surface formed the floor of the room. A tiny punt lay\nmoored to it. Farther back a small, steep flight of steps led up through a\nrectangular opening to the building above.\n\nMost of the light in this lower room came down through this opening; and\nnow, as Mercer stood quiet looking about him, he could hear plainly the\nvoices of men in the room above.\n\nAnina was beside him.\n\n\"They're up there,\" he whispered, pointing. \"Let's land and see if we can\nget up those stairs a ways and hear what they're saying.\"\n\nThey stood a moment, undecided, and then from the silence and darkness\nabout them they distinctly heard a low muffled sound.\n\n\"What's that?\" whispered Mercer, startled. \"Didn't you hear that, Anina?\nThere's something over there by the bottom of the steps.\"\n\nThey listened, but only the murmur of the voices from above, and an\noccasional footstep, broke the stillness.\n\n\"I tell you I heard something,\" Mercer persisted. \"There's something over\nthere.\" He rattled a bit of rope incautiously, as if to startle a rat from\nits hiding place. \"Let's tie up, Anina.\"\n\nThey made the boat fast, but in such a way that they could cast it loose\nquickly.\n\n\"We might want to get out of here in a hurry,\" Mercer whispered with a\ngrin. \"You never can tell, Anina.\"\n\nHe stood stock still. The sound near at hand was repeated. It was\nunmistakable this time--a low, stifled moan.\n\nMercer stepped lightly out of the boat onto the platform. A few boxes, a\ncoil of rope, and other odds and ends stood about. He felt his way forward\namong them toward the bottom of the steps. He heard the moan again, and\nnow he saw the outlines of a human figure lying against the farther wall.\n\nAnina was close behind him.\n\n\"There's somebody over there,\" he whispered. \"Hurt or sick, maybe.\"\n\nThey crept forward.\n\nIt was a woman, bound hand and foot and gagged. Mercer bent over and tore\nthe cloth from her face. In another instant Anina was upon her knees,\nsobbing softly, with her mother's head in her lap.\n\nThey loosed the cords that held her, and chaffed her stiffened limbs. She\nsoon recovered, for she was not injured. She told Anina her story\nthen--how Baar had captured her in her home while she was waiting for\nMiela and me, and how two of his men had brought her here to the Water\nCity by boat at once.\n\nThat was all she knew, except that this house was the headquarters of\nTao's emissaries, who, it appeared, were now allied with Baar and his\nparty.\n\nAnina whispered all this to Mercer when her mother had finished.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" said Mercer.\n\nThe responsibility of two women, especially the elder Lua, who could not\nfly, weighed suddenly upon him, and his first thought was to get back to\nthe Great City at once.\n\nAnina helped her mother into the boat.\n\n\"Wait,\" she whispered to Mercer. \"I hear what they say. You wait here.\"\n\nShe went to the foot of the steps and began climbing them cautiously.\n\n\"Not on your life, I won't wait here,\" Mercer muttered to himself, and,\ngripping the light-ray cylinder firmly as though he feared it might get\naway from him, he joined Anina on the stairway.\n\nSlowly, cautiously they made their way upward. The steps were fairly wide,\nand they went up almost side by side. From near the top they could see a\nportion of the room above.\n\nThe corner of a table showed, around which a number of men were gathered,\neating. A woman was moving about the room serving them.\n\nTheir words, from here, were plainly audible. Mercer would have gone a\nstep or two higher, without thought of discovery, but Anina held him back.\n\"Wait, Ollie. I hear now what they say.\"\n\nThey stood silent. The men were talking earnestly. Mercer could hear their\nwords, but of course understood nothing he heard.\n\n\"What do they say, Anina?\" he whispered impatiently after a moment.\n\n\"Baar is here with two or three of his men. He talks with Tao's men. They\ntalk about men from Twilight Country. Waiting for them now. Speak of\nstorm. Worried--because men do not come. Waiting for light-ray.\"\n\n\"They'll have a long wait,\" Mercer chuckled. \"Let's get out of here,\nAnina.\"\n\nHe must have made a slight noise, or perhaps he and Anina, crouching there\non the stairs, were seen by some one above. He never knew quite how it\noccurred, but, without warning, a man stood at the opening, looking down\nat them.\n\nThere was a shout, and the room above was in instant turmoil. Mercer lost\nhis head. Anina pulled at him and said something, but he did not hear her.\nHe only knew that they had been discovered, and that most of their enemies\nin the Water City were crowded together in this one room at hand. And _he_\nhad the light-ray--the only one in the city.\n\nA sudden madness possessed him. He tore away from Anina and, climbing up\nthe steps of the stairway, leaped into the room above.\n\nTwenty or thirty men faced him, most of them about the table. Several had\nstarted hastily to their feet; two or three chairs were overturned.\n\nThe man who had been looking down into the opening darted back as Mercer\ncame up, and shouted again.\n\nMercer saw it was Baar.\n\n\nTHE WATER CITY.\n\nThe men around the table were now all on their feet. One of them picked up\na huge metal goblet and flung it at Mercer's head. The last remaining bit\nof reason Mercer had left fled from him. Without thought of what he was\nabout, he raised the metal cylinder; his thumb found the little button and\npressed it hard; he waved the cylinder back and forth before him.\n\nIt was over in an instant. Mercer relaxed his pressure on the button and\nstaggered back. He was sick and faint from what he had seen--with the\nrealization of what he had done. Flames were rising all about him. The\nroom was full of smoke. He held his breath, finding his way back somehow\nto the stairway, with the agonized screams of the men ringing in his\nears. He caught a glimpse of Anina's white face as she stood there where\nhe had left her.\n\n\"Good God. Anina! Go back! Go back! I'm coming!\"\n\nHe tripped near the top of the stairs and fell in a heap onto the platform\nbelow, but he still held the cylinder clutched tightly in his hand.\n\nAnina groped her way down to him. He gripped her by the arm. He was\ntrembling like a leaf. The crackling of the burning house above came down\nto him; the cries of the men were stilled.\n\n\"Come, Anina,\" he half whispered. \"Hurry--let's get away, anywhere.\nHome--out of this cursed city.\"\n\nLua was still in the boat. Her calm, steady glance brought Mercer back to\nhis senses. They shoved the boat out from under the house, and in a moment\nmore were heading back through the city. The building they had left was\nnow a mass of flames, with a great cloud of smoke, rolling up from it. A\nwoman stood on the front platform an instant, and then, screaming, flung\nherself into the water.\n\nThe city was in commotion. Faces appeared at windows; girls flew up and\ngathered in a frightened flock, circling about the burning building; boats\nmiraculously appeared from everywhere. Lua was steering their boat on its\ntortuous way between the houses. She put the boat nearly to full speed,\nand as they swept past a house nearly collided with a punt that was\ncrossing behind it.\n\nMercer's nerves were still shaken. He handed Anina the light-ray cylinder.\n\n\"Here--take it, Anina. I don't want the cursed thing. Shoot it up into the\nair. Somebody might try and stop us. That'll scare them. Careful you don't\nhit anything!\"\n\nAnina played the light about in the air for a time, but soon there were so\nmany girls flying about she had to shut it off. A few minutes more and\nthey had passed the last of the houses, swept around the bend in the\nriver, and left the frightened city out of sight behind them.\n\nThey had left the river and, following close along shore, headed for the\nbayous that led up to the Great City. The storm had now entirely passed,\nleaving the daylight unusually bright and a fresh coolness in the air. The\nsea was still rough, although not alarmingly so, and the boat made\ncomparatively slow progress. It was two hours or more--to Mercer it seemed\na whole day--before they were nearing the bayous. Anina was sitting by his\nside in the center of the boat. Lua was steering.\n\n\"You hungry, Ollie?\" the girl asked, smiling.\n\nMercer shook his head. He had forgotten they had intended to eat in the\nWater City.\n\n\"I very hungry. Soon we--\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly, staring up into the sky ahead of them.\n\nMercer followed her glance. A little black blob showed against the gray;\noff to one side two other smaller black dots appeared.\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Mercer, alarmed.\n\nThey watched a few moments in silence. Then Mercer took the cylinder, and\nflashed its light into the air.\n\n\"If it's anybody connected with Tao, that'll show they'd better keep\naway,\" he explained grimly.\n\nAnina smiled. \"Tao people cannot fly, Ollie.\"\n\nA few moments more and they saw what it was. And within ten minutes they\nhad landed at the mouth of one of the bayous, and Miela and I were with\nthem.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR WAR.\n\n\nThe months that followed were the busiest, I think, of my life. I began by\na complete reorganization of this government of which I found myself the\nhead. For the doddering old councilors of the late king I substituted men\nwhom I selected from among those of the city's prominent business men who\ncared to serve.\n\nThe personnel of the police force I allowed to remain, for I soon saw they\nwere inclined to act very differently under me than under my predecessor.\nThe various other officials of this somewhat vague organization I\nsubjected to a thorough weeding out.\n\nThe net result was chaos for a time, but, far more quickly than I had\nanticipated, I had things running again. I made no radical changes except\nin personnel. I attempted to do nothing that was outside the then existing\nlaws, and no new laws were passed. But from the very first I made it clear\nthat I was not one to be trifled with.\n\nWithin a few days after I was put into power I interviewed Fuero and his\nscientific confr\u00e8res. I found them a body of grave men who represented the\nhighest type of the nation. They made it plain to me at once that they\nwould not concern themselves in any way with government affairs. Two years\nbefore they had recognized Tao's menace, and had been preparing for it by\nthe manufacture of large quantities of war material which, in case of\nextreme necessity, they would turn over to the government. This armament,\nas Miela had told me, they guarded themselves, not trusting it even to\ntheir workmen.\n\nThe scientific men, I understood now, were among the richest in the\nnation, owing to the widespread use of their industrial appliances. It was\nonly a portion of this wealth that they were expending in the manufacture\nof armament.\n\nI demanded the release to me of this war material. I explained them my\nplans, and told them in detail of Tao's visit to earth. They held several\nconferences over a period of two or three days, but in the end I got what\nI asked for.\n\nSo much for affairs in the Great City. I recognized during these days the\npossibility of an armed invasion from the Twilight Country. I was better\nprepared to meet it now, should it come, and I at once took steps to be\nwarned as far in advance as possible. To this end I had girls patrolling\nthe Narrow Sea, not only on our shore, but over in the Twilight Country as\nwell; and I was satisfied that if Tao made any move we would be notified\nat once. Simultaneously with all this, we devoted ourselves to the\nunification of the nation, for in very truth it seemed about to\ndisintegrate. Here it was that the girls were of the greatest assistance.\n\nWe organized them into an army which consisted of fifty squads of ten\ngirls each, with a leader for each squad. All of these girls were armed\nwith the light-ray cylinders. With this \"flying army\" Mercer and I made a\ntour of the Light Country cities. We wasted no time with formalities, but\nrounded up Tao's men wherever we could find them, and transported them\nunceremoniously back to the Twilight Country shore.\n\nIn two or three of the cities--the Water City particularly--there was a\nshow of rebellion among the people; but our light-rays cowed them\ninstantly, and in no instance did we have to kill or injure any one.\nThrough Miela I made speeches everywhere. It was not my wish to hold the\ncountry in sullen subjection, and to that end I appealed to their\npatriotism in this coming war against Tao and the Twilight People. This\naspect of the matter met with ready response, and everywhere our meetings\nended in enthusiastic acclaim.\n\nWe started now to raise an army of young men, which we proposed to\ntransport across the Narrow Sea for land operations in the Twilight\nCountry. Before a week had passed I saw, by the response that came from my\nvarious proclamations, that conscription would be unnecessary. With this\ntangible evidence of the coming war the patriotism of the people grew by\nleaps and bounds. The fact that the girls of the Great City were not only\nin favor of it, but were actually already in service--a thing\nunprecedented in the history of the nation--brought the sympathies of all\nthe women with us strongly.\n\nThrough the governors of each city I raised a separate army of young men,\nofficered by the older men, most of whom had taken part in past fighting.\nEach of these little armies, as yet without arms, was drilled and held in\nreadiness for orders from the Great City.\n\nI had, during all this time, selected as many able men as possible from\namong the Great City's population, and given them over to Fuero and his\nassociates for training in the use of the light-ray rockets, the larger\nprojectors, protective measures against the ray, and many other appliances\nwhich I understood only vaguely myself.\n\nIt was after our return from the tour of the different cities, and before\nthe recruiting of the young men was fairly under way, when like a\nbombshell came the news from our flying patrol that a fleet of armed boats\nwas coming down the river from the Lone City. The attack from Tao was at\nhand, and our preparations were still far from complete. We had our army\nof girls in active operation, and that was all. Tao's boats would reach\nthe Light Country shore in a few hours. There was no time for anything but\nthe hastiest of preparations. We decided then to call the army of girls\nand meet the boats in the Narrow Sea, turning them back if possible.\n\nI have now to explain the method of defense against the light-ray. In\ntheory I only vaguely understood it. In practice it was simple and, like\nmost defenses, only partially effective.\n\nBob Trevor, has already mentioned it--the suits of black cloth he saw in\nthe Mercutian camp in Wyoming. It was not, as he had afterward supposed, a\ndye for fabrics. Instead, it was the thread of a worm--like our silk\nworm--which in its natural state was black and was impervious to the ray.\nBy that I mean a substance whose molecules increased their vibration rate\nonly slightly from a brief contact with the ray.\n\nIt was only partly efficacious, for after an exposure of a minute or more\nthe intense heat of the ray was communicated. It then became partly\npenetrable, and anything close behind it would be destroyed.\n\nWe had under manufacture at this time a number of protective devices by\nwhich this substance might be used. Boats had, in the past, been equipped\nwith a sort of shield or hood in front, making them more or less\nimpervious to a direct horizontal beam of the light.\n\nTao's boats which now threatened us were so protected, I was informed by\nthe girls who reported them. Recognizing the probability of an attack by\nus from the air, they also had a covering of the cloth, like a canopy\nabove them. But as may be readily understood, such protection could be\nmade only partly effective.\n\nI had already manufactured, at Miela's suggestion, a number of shields for\nour girls to carry while in flight. These consisted of the fabric in very\nlight, almost diaphanous, form, hung upon a flexible frame of very thin\nstrips of bamboo. It was some twelve feet broad across the top, narrowing\nrapidly into a long fluttering tail like a kite.\n\nThere was nothing rigid about this shield. Its two or three bamboo ribs\nwere as flexible as a whip, with the veiling--it was hardly more than\nthat--fluttering below them almost entirely unsupported. In weight, the\nwhole approximated one-twelfth that of a girl, not at all a difficult\namount to carry.\n\nWithin two hours after the report came--it was near midday--we were ready\nto start from the Great City to repel Tao's attack. Our forces consisted\nof some six hundred girls, each armed with a light-ray cylinder and a\nshield. This was the organization I have already mentioned, fifty squads\nof ten, each with a leader; and fifty other girls, the most daring and\nexpert in the air, who were to act independently.\n\nWe had two platforms, protected by the fabric, and with a sort of canopy\naround the sides underneath, over which the girls grasping the handles\ncould fly. Mercer and Anina rode on one platform, and Miela and I on the\nother. All of us were dressed in the black garments.\n\nOn each of the platforms we had mounted a projector of higher power than\nthe hand cylinders, although of course of much less effective range than\nthose the Mercutians had used in Wyoming.\n\nThus equipped we rose into the air from the castle grounds in the Great\nCity, with a silent, awed multitude watching us--as strange an army,\nprobably, as ever went forth to battle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\nTHE BATTLE.\n\n\nWe swept out over the Great City, flying in the battle-formation we had\nused many times before on our trips about the country. Mercer's platform\nand mine were some fifty feet apart, leading. Behind us, in a great\nsemicircle, the girls spread out, fifty little groups of ten, each with\nits single leader in front. Below, a hundred feet perhaps, the fifty other\ngirls darted back and forth, keeping pace with us. The aspect of these\ngirls, flying thus to battle, was truly extraordinary. The pink-white\nflesh of their bodies; their limbs incased in the black veiling; their\nlong black or golden hair; and the vivid red or blue feathered wings\nflashing behind those wide, fluttering, flimsy black shields--it was a\nsight the like of which I never shall see again.\n\nThere was almost no wind, for which I was thankful, as it made our\nmaneuvers in the air considerably less difficult. When we reached the\nNarrow Sea our patrols reported that Tao's ships were still in the river,\nwaiting for others from the Lone City to join them. We hastened on, for I\nwished to meet them as near the Twilight shore as possible.\n\nWe believed, from the reports our girls had brought us, that the enemy\nwould have some twenty or thirty boats, most of them similar to that in\nwhich Mercer and Anina weathered the storm on the way to the Water City.\n\nWe assumed that the men in the boats would be armed with the hand\nlight-ray cylinders. These projected a beam not over four inches broad and\nhad an effective range of about five hundred feet. The boats probably\nwould carry large projectors also. They might be set up in the boats ready\nfor use, or they might not.\n\nWhat range they would have we could not estimate, though we hoped we\nshould encounter nothing more powerful than this one Miela and I had on\nthe platform. Its beam was about twenty inches wide, its effective radius\nsomething like a thousand feet.\n\nWe did not expect to encounter the very large projectors. We had some in\nthe Great City with a range of something like ten miles, and others of\nlesser range that spread the ray out fan shape. But these were extremely\nheavy, and we were confident it would not be practical to mount them in\nthe boats.\n\nWe sighted the enemy in the Narrow Sea just before the Twilight shore was\nreached. The first intimation we had was the sight of one of the narrow\nbeams of red-green light flashing about in the twilight. As we crept\ncloser, at an altitude of some two thousand feet, we saw the dim outlines\nof the boats in the water below.\n\nThere were, I made out, some ten or fifteen in sight. They were heading\nout into the sea in single file. Miela and I had carefully discussed the\ntactics we were to employ. Mercer understood our plans, and we had three\nor four girls detailed to fly close to the platforms and carry our orders\nabout to the leaders of the various little squads.\n\nWe sighted the boats when we were about a mile away, and, as I have said,\nat an altitude of some two thousand feet. They must have seen us soon\nafterward, for many light-rays now began flashing up from them.\n\nSo far as I could determine, each boat seemed armed only with one mounted\nprojector; these I believed to be of somewhat similar power to our own.\nOur first move was to poise directly over the enemy, rising to an altitude\nof twenty-five hundred feet. The boats kept straight on their way, and we\nfollowed them, circling overhead in lengthening spirals, but keeping well\nout of range.\n\nI had ordered that none of the rays be flashed at this time, and it must\nhave been difficult for the men in the boats below to see us in the dusk,\nshrouded as we were in black. They sent up a rocket once; it mounted above\nus in a slow flaming arc, hung poised an instant, and then descended,\nplunging into the sea a mile or so away. We heard distinctly the hiss of\nits contact with the water, and saw, like a quickly dissipating mist, the\ncloud of steam that arose.\n\nWe were not armed with these rockets, for to discharge them from the\nplatforms would have been impractical. But we did not fear them being used\nagainst us. Even if true aim had been possible, we could easily avoid\ntheir slow flight.\n\nThe protecting canopy below the sides of our platform made it difficult to\nsee what was going on below us. Miela and I lay prone, with our heads\nprojecting over its forward end. In this position we had an unobstructed,\nthough somewhat limited, view. The girls carrying us could see nothing.\nThey were guided by watching the other girls flying near them, and by\nMiela's constant directions.\n\nFor some ten or fifteen minutes we circled about over the leading boat.\nThe Twilight shore was now almost over the horizon. The boats showed as\nlittle black patches on the gray-black of the sea, but the lights flashing\nup from them were plainly visible.\n\nThe boat that led the line was quite perceptibly drawing away from the\nothers. Already it was a thousand feet or more ahead of the nearest one\nfollowing. We waited through another period. This leading boat was now\nbeyond range of the others, and, being isolated, I decided to attack it.\n\n\"Miela,\" I said, \"tell them all to maintain this level. You and I will go\ndown at that first boat. Have them all remain up here. Tell Mercer if\nanything goes wrong with us to act as he thinks best.\"\n\nWe waited while these commands were circulated about. Mercer's platform\nswept close over us, and he shouted: \"We _won't_ stay up here.\"\n\nI persuaded him finally, and then we directed our girls to circle slowly\ndownward with our platform. I ordered a slow descent, for I was in no mind\nto rush blindly into range of their ray.\n\nWe drooped down in a spiral, until at about fifteen hundred feet I ordered\nthe girls to descend no farther. So far as I could make out now, this boat\nwas protected from above by a broad overhanging canopy. Its sides\nevidently were open, or nearly so, for we could see now the smaller rays\nflashing out horizontally.\n\nThe large projector was mounted in the bow beyond the canopy. Its beam\nobviously could be directed into the air, for it was now swinging up\ntoward us. But in the horizontal position its range was limited to an arc\nin front of the boat. I saw then that our play was to attack from a low\nlevel, since only in that way could we expect to reach a vulnerable spot\nin the boat's armor. And I believed that if we could keep behind it they\ncould not reach us with their larger projector.\n\nWe swooped downward almost to the water level, and reached it a thousand\nfeet perhaps off to one side of the boat and partly behind it. The smaller\nprojectors flashed out at us, but we were beyond their range. The\nprojector in the bow swung back and forth, and as we skimmed the surface\nof the water, heading toward the boat, it turned to face us.\n\nWhat followed happened so quickly I had no time to consult with Miela. She\ndirected our flight. I turned the current into our projector and tried to\nbring its beam to bear on the boat. We approached within some eight\nhundred feet of it, darting back and forth, sometimes rising a hundred\nfeet or more, sometimes skimming the surface, but always keeping behind\nthe boat as it turned in an endeavor to face us.\n\nMy light-ray beam hit the water frequently, with a great boiling and\nhissing, sending up clouds of steam that for a moment obscured the scene.\nOnce or twice our opponent's beam flashed over us, but we were beyond its\narc before they could bring it directly to bear.\n\nI grew confused at the rapid turns we made. The dark outlines of the boat,\nwith its twenty or thirty flashing red and green lights, seemed everywhere\nat once. I swung my projector about as best I could, but the swiftly\nshifting target seemed too elusive. Once, as we dropped suddenly downward,\nI thought we should plunge into the hissing, roaring water below. Again,\nthe opposing ray swung directly under us, as we darted upward to avoid it.\n\n\"I can't make it, Miela,\" I said. \"Hold steady toward them if you can.\"\n\nShe did not answer, but kept her face over the platform's end and issued\nher swift directions to the girls. Once, as we tilted sharply upward, I\ncaught a glimpse of a black-shape sweeping past, overhead. It was Mercer's\nplatform, flying unswervingly toward the boat, its red-green beam steady\nbefore it like a locomotive headlight. We turned to follow; my own light\nswung dangerously near Mercer, and I turned the current off hastily.\n\nThe wind of our forward flight whistled past my ears; Miela's directions\nto the girls rose shrill above it. I caught a glimpse of the darting\nlights of the boat ahead. Then, when we were hardly more than six hundred\nfeet away, Mercer's light picked it up. I saw the little lurid red circle\nit made as it struck the boat's canopy top, and roved along it end to end.\nMercer's platform darted lower, and from that angle his light swept under\nthe canopy. A man's scream of agony came to us across the water. The\nlights on the boat were extinguished; only the yellow glare of the flames\nrising from its interior fittings remained.\n\nThen, a moment later, the boat's stern rose into the air, and it slid\nhissing into the water, leaving only a little wreckage and a few\nstruggling forms on the swirling surface.\n\nWe swung sharply upward. Again Mercer's platform--its light now\nextinguished--swept directly over us. His exultant voice floated down.\n\n\"We did it, Alan! We did it! Come on up!\"\n\nWe rose to the upper air, where the girls were still circling about. The\nother boats were keeping on their course, spreading farther apart now to\nbe out of range of each other's projectors. I had hoped they would turn\nback with this catastrophe to their leader, but they did not.\n\nI consulted hastily with Miela, and then we gave the order for a general\nattack, allowing each of the leading girls to act as she saw fit.\n\nLike a great flock of birds we swooped downward upon our prey, spreading\nout to attack all the boats at once. The girls now turned on their hand\nlights--a myriad tiny beams darting about in the semidarkness.\n\nI cannot attempt to describe the scene that followed. It can be imagined,\nperhaps, but not told in words. As we swept within range of the lights\nthat swung up from below to meet us, I saw a girl, flying alone, pass\ndirectly through one of the red beams. It seemed to strike her sidewise.\nIn an instant she had passed beyond it. I saw the dim outlines of her form\nas she fluttered onward, wavering and aimless like a wounded bird. And\nthen she fell, turning over and over as with one wing she strove vainly to\nsupport herself, until at last, wrapped in the sable shroud of her shield,\nshe plunged with a great splash into the sea.\n\nThe flashing light-rays all about us now seemed mingled in inextricable\nconfusion. The girls must have passed through them frequently, protected\nby their shields; and I know our platform was several times struck by them\nfrom below. The absence of sound was uncanny. Only the whistling wind of\nour flight, the flapping of the girl's wings, and the hissing of steam as\nour rays struck the water, accompanied this inferno of light.\n\nWe swept beyond the boat we had singled out, passing five or six hundred\nfeet above it, and in the effort to avoid its ray turning so that I was\nunable to bring mine upon it. As we rose again, beyond it, I saw a boat\noff to the left in flames. A dozen girls had rushed upon it, darting in\namong its smaller rays to where their own would be effective. But there\nwas only one girl above it now, struggling brokenly to maintain herself in\nflight. The boat sank with the roar of an explosion of some kind, but in\nthe sudden darkness about I could still see this lone wounded girl\nfluttering onward.\n\nWe were not far away; I pointed her out to Miela, and instead of swinging\nback we kept on toward her. We contrived to pass close under her, and she\nfell abruptly almost into my arms. I stretched her out gently on the\nplatform and turned back to Miela, who was kneeling behind our projector.\n\nWe were now nearly half a mile from the nearest of the boats. Several of\nthem evidently had been sunk, and two or three others were sinking. One I\ncould make out heading back for the Twilight shore; above it the lights of\nour girls following showed vivid against the dark-gray sky. Where Mercer's\nplatform was I could not tell.\n\nMiela gripped my shoulder.\n\n\"See, Alan--there!\" She pointed off to one side. \"One of the boats tries\nto escape.\"\n\nWe were now some five hundred feet above the water. Half a mile beyond us,\nall its lights out, one of the boats was scurrying away, on across toward\nthe Light Country. For some reason none of our girls seemed following it.\n\nMiela issued a sharp command; we swooped downward at lightning speed and,\nbarely skimming the surface, flew after this escaping enemy. Whether its\nlarger projector had been rendered inoperative, or many of its crew\nkilled, or whether it thought merely to escape us and make a landing in\nthe Light Country, I did not know.\n\nWhatever the reason, no lights showed from this boat as we drew after it.\nI had our own light out. When we came close within range I flashed it on\nsuddenly. We were flying steadily, and I picked up the boat without\ndifficulty, raking it through from stern to stem under its protecting\ncanopy. I could see the canopy drop as its supporting metal framework\nfused in the heat of the ray; flames rose from the interior wooden\nfittings; the boat's stern seemed to melt away as the thin metal was\nrendered molten; the water about it boiled under the heat. A cloud of\nsteam then rose up, obscuring it completely from my sight.\n\nI switched off the light. We continued on, rising a little. The steam\ndissipated. Directly below us on the bubbling, swirling water a few\ntwisted black forms bobbed about. We were so close now I could see them\nplainly. I looked away hastily.\n\nWe swung back toward the Twilight shore, rising sharply. There seemed now\nonly one boat afloat. Far above it I saw a tiny black oblong that I knew\nwas Mercer's platform. A swarm of other dots, with the tiny pencils of red\nlight flashing from them, showed where the cloud of girls were swooping\ndown to the attack. Now that we were out of the action, I had opportunity\nto watch what was going on more closely.\n\nThis last engagement seemed to last less than a minute. The girls darted\nfearlessly downward among the rays that swung up from the boat. Scores of\nthem were hit; I could see their forms illuminated for an instant by the\nlurid red and green light. Some passed through it safely; many fell. But\nthose who got within range hit the boat without difficulty. Its lights\nwent out suddenly and a moment later it sank. The girls' lights flashed\noff, and they rose again into the air--tiny black shapes circling about\nMercer's platform.\n\nThe scene now seemed suddenly very dark, peaceful and still. A great\nweight lifted from my heart, though it still remained heavy with what I\nhad seen. I turned to Miela; her face was white and drawn.\n\n\"We have won, my girl,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled wanly.\n\n\"We have won. But, oh, Alan, that women should have to do such deeds!\"\n\nHer eyes shone with the light of a soul in sorrow.\n\n\"Pray to your God now, my husband, that this war may be the last, for all\ntime, in all the universe.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\nTHE SIEGE OF THE LONE CITY.\n\n\nOur losses totaled nearly a hundred and fifty girls. We brought back with\nus on the platforms but six wounded. I shall never forget that hour we\nspent searching among the wreckage--those blackened, twisted forms of what\nhad once been men and women. I shall not describe it.\n\nOf all the boats which Tao had dispatched on this ill-fated expedition,\nonly one escaped to return with news of the disaster. I was glad now that\none, at least, had survived, for the report it would give would, I felt\nsure, dissuade Tao from making any other similar attempt at invasion.\n\nOur broken little army made its way slowly back to the Great City. We\nwent, not in triumph, but indeed with all the aspect of defeat. The people\nreceived us in a frenzy of joy and gratitude to the girls for what they\nhad done.\n\nThis first battle took place, as I have said, just after we four had\nreturned from our tour of the Light Country, and before the recruiting of\nthe young men was fairly under way. To this recruiting it proved an\nextraordinary stimulus. The girls, having been in successful action,\nstirred the young men of the nation as probably nothing else could, and\nall over the country they came forward faster than they could be enrolled.\n\nIt was two or three days after the battle that Miela came to me one\nmorning with the wounded girl she and I had rescued in the air.\n\n\"We have a plan--Sela and I--my husband,\" she said.\n\nThe girl seemed hardly more than a sweet little child--fifteen or sixteen,\nperhaps. It gave me a shock now to realize that we had allowed her to go\ninto such a combat. One of her blue-feathered wings was bound in a cloth.\nIts lower portion, I could tell, had been burned away.\n\n\"Never will she fly again, my husband,\" said Miela, \"for she is one of\nthose who has sacrificed her wings that we might all be safe from the\ninvader.\"\n\nShe then went on to explain that now, while this feeling of gratitude to\nthe girls ran so high among the people, the time seemed propitious for\nchanging the long-hated law regarding their wings. I had not thought of\nthat, but agreed with her wholly.\n\nI called the people into the castle gardens that same night. Never had I\nseen such a gathering. We allowed fully ten thousand to come in; the rest\nwe were forced to send away.\n\nMiela made a speech, telling them that in recognition of the girls'\nservices in this war, I had decided to allow them henceforth to keep their\nwings unmutilated after marriage. We exhibited this little girl, Sela, as\none who had given her power of flight, not as a sacrifice on the altar of\nman's selfishness, but in the service of her country. Then Sela herself\nmade a speech, in her earnest little child voice, pleading for her\nsisters.\n\nWhen she ended there may have been some unmarried men in our audience who\nwere still against the measure--doubtless there were--but they were afraid\nor ashamed to let their feeling be known. When the meeting broke up I had\nample evidence of the people's wishes upon which to proceed.\n\nWithin a week my congress met, and the law was repealed. We informed the\nother cities of this action, and everywhere it was met with enthusiasm.\n\nEnlistment and war preparations went steadily on, but despite it all there\nwere more marriages that next month--three times over--than in any before.\nI had now been in power some three months, and the time was approaching\nwhen we were ready to make our invasion of the Twilight Country. We had\nbeen maintaining a rigid a\u00ebrial patrol of the Narrow Sea, but no further\nactivities of the enemy had been threatened.\n\nThe expedition, when it was ready, numbered about a thousand young men,\neach armed with one of the hand light-ray cylinders; fifty officers, and\nabout fifty older men in charge of the projectors and rockets, who, for\nwant of a better term, I might call our artillery corps. There was also\nthe organization of girls, and a miscellaneous corps of men to handle the\nboats, mechanics to set up the projectors, and a commissariat.\n\nThe thousand young men represented those we had selected from the several\nthousand enlisted in the Great City. All the rest, and the many thousands\nin the other cities, we were holding in reserve.\n\nWe took with us, on this invading expedition, only small-wheeled trucks,\non which to convey the larger projectors, and storage tanks and other\nheavy apparatus, for the Lone City river ran directly to the point where\nwe planned to conduct our siege.\n\nSome forty large boats were required to carry the men, ammunition and\nsupplies. Mercer and I, with Anina and Miela, traveled as before through\nthe air on the two platforms with the girls. We crossed the Narrow Sea\nwithout incident and entered the river.\n\nSeveral hours up, the river narrowed and entered a rocky gorge, four or\nfive hundred feet wide and a thousand feet deep, with almost perpendicular\nsides. Along one of these ran the Lone City trail. We passed through this\ngorge. The river here flowed with a current that amounted almost to\nrapids. Our boats made slow progress. Finally we emerged into an even\nwilder country, almost devoid of trees. Here we made our first night's\nencampment.\n\nNoon of the next day found us approaching the Lone City. We did not need\nto surmise now that Tao would be warned, for far away on the horizon ahead\nwe saw the beams from his great projectors mounting up into the blackness\nof the sky. Some four miles from the Lone City the river we were ascending\nswept off to the right. This was its closest point to the city, and here\nwe disembarked. There were several docks and a few houses, but we found\nthem all deserted.\n\nThe Lone City was particularly well suited to defense, even though the lay\nof the country was such that we were enabled to approach here within four\nmiles, and establish our base in comparative safety. The country was wild\nand rocky, with few trees. The river bed lay in a ca\u00f1on. From where we\nlanded, a valley so deep and narrow, it might almost be termed a ca\u00f1on,\nalso led up to the city.\n\nThis valley was some two miles wide, with a level floor, and precipitous,\nrocky sides towering in many places over a thousand feet. Above it\nstretched a broken plateau country. The valley had many sharp bends and\nturns, as though in some distant past it had been the bed of a great river\nthat had eroded its tortuous course through the rock.\n\nThe Lone City lay shut in at the bottom of this valley between two of its\nbends. It was a settlement of perhaps ten thousand people, the only city\nin the Twilight Country, with one exception, on this hemisphere of\nMercury.\n\nWe established our field base here at the river, and I devoted the next\nfew days to informing myself of the exact lay of the country, and the\nmethods of defense of the city Tao had provided.\n\nI found this defense the height of simplicity, and for its purpose as\neffective as it well could be. A vertical barrage of light surrounded the\ncity, extending upward into the air with the most powerful projectors some\nten or fifteen miles, and, with those of the spreading rays, forming a\nsolid wall of light at the lower altitudes. There were no projectors past\nthe first turn in the valley toward the river--where they could have been\ndirected horizontally--and none of them on the cliff tops above the city.\nThus, although we could not get over this light-barrage, we could approach\nit closely in many places.\n\nTao's tactics became immediately evident. He had thrown an almost\nimpregnable barrier close about him and, trusting to its protection, was\nmaking no effort to combat us for the moment with any moves of offense.\n\nMy first endeavor was to find a position on top of the cliffs from which\nthe city could be reached with a projector. It was practically the only\nthing to do. The city could not be approached in front from the valley\nfloor; its entire surface beyond the turn was swept by the light-rays.\nApproach from below in the rear was likewise barred.\n\nHad the barrage been not so high our girls might have flown over it and\ndropped bombs, or we might have sent rockets over it and dropped them into\nthe city. Neither of these projects was practical. The girls could not fly\nover that barrage. It was too cold in the higher altitudes. Nor could we\nsend rockets over, for rockets sent through the light were exploded before\nthey could reach their mark.\n\nThe projectors along the sides of the city were located for the most part\na hundred feet or more back from the base of the surrounding cliffs. This\nallowed them to cut the cliff face at the top. It will be understood then\nthat we could approach the brink of the cliff in many places, but never\nsufficiently near to be able to direct our rays downward into the city.\n\nThese cliffs were exceedingly jagged and broken. They overhung in many\nplaces. Great rifts split them; ravines wound their way down, many of\nthese with small, stunted trees growing in them. A descent from the summit\nto the floor of the valley, had we been unimpeded by the light, would in\nmany places not have been difficult.\n\nDuring the next week, we succeeded--working in the prevailing gloom--in\nestablishing a projector at the mouth of a ravine which emerged at the\ncliff face hardly a hundred feet from the valley bottom. This point was\nbelow the spreading light-rays which swept the cliff top above. We mounted\nthe projector without discovery, and, flashing it on suddenly, swept the\nvalley with its rays. An opposing ray from below picked it out almost\nimmediately, and destroyed it, killing two of our men.\n\nThe irregularities of the cliffs made several other similar attempts\npossible. We took advantage of them, and in each case were able to rake\nthe valley with our fire for a moment before our projector was located and\ndestroyed. One, which we were at great pains to protect, was maintained\nfor a somewhat longer period.\n\nI believed we had done an immense amount of damage by these momentarily\nactive projectors, although our enemy gave no sign.\n\nWe then tried dropping rockets at the base of the lights in the valley.\nThere were few points at which they could be reached without striking the\nrays first. But we persisted, sending up a hundred or more. Most were\nineffective; a few found their mark, as we could tell by a sudden \"hole\"\nin the barrage, which, however, was invariably repaired before we could\nmake it larger.\n\nThese activities lasted a week or more. It began, to look as though we had\nentered upon a lengthy siege. I wondered how long the city's food supply\nwould last if we settled down to starve it out. The thought came to me\nthen that Tao might be almost ready for his second expedition to the\nearth. Was he indeed merely standing us off in this way so that some day\nhe might depart in his vehicle before our very eyes?\n\nTao began to adopt our tactics. Without warning one day a projector from a\ntowering eminence near the city flashed down at the river encampment. That\nwe were not entirely destroyed was due to the extreme watchfulness of our\nguards, who located it immediately with their rays. As it was, we lost\nnearly a hundred men in the single moment it was in operation.\n\nWe then withdrew our camp farther away down the river, to a point where\nthe conformation of the country made a repetition of this attack\nimpossible. A sort of guerrilla warfare now began in the mountains. Our\nscouting parties frequently met Tao's men, and many encounters, swiftly\nfatal to one side or the other, took place. But all the time we were able,\nat intervals, to rake the valley with our fire for brief periods.\n\nMercer constantly was evolving plans of the utmost daring, most of them\nindeed amounting practically to suicide for those undertaking them. But I\nheld him back. Our present tactics were dangerous enough, although after\nthe first few fatalities we succeeded in protecting our men, even though\nour projectors were invariably destroyed.\n\nOne of Mercer's plans we tried with some success. There were some places\nin the light-barrage that were much less high than others. We devised a\nsmaller rocket that could be fired from the platforms. Mercer took it up\nsome twenty thousand feet, and sent several rockets over the light, which\nwe hoped dropped into the city.\n\nA month went by in this way. We were in constant communication by water\nwith the Great City, receiving supplies and re\u00ebnforcements of men and\narmament. And then gradually the situation changed. Over a period of\nseveral days our hand-to-hand encounters with the enemy grew less\nfrequent. Finally two or three days went by without one of them taking\nplace.\n\nWe became bolder and prepared to establish several projectors at different\npoints for simultaneous fire at a given signal. The light-barrage in the\nvalley remained unchanged, although now its beams held steady instead of\nsometimes swinging to and fro. We dislodged one of its projectors with a\nrocket, making a hole in the barrage, which this time was not repaired.\nAnd then, to our amazement, the lights one by one began to die away. We\nceased operations, waiting. Within half a day they had all vanished, like\nlights which had flickered and burned out.\n\nMercer, unthinking, was all for an instant attack. We could indeed have\nswept the valley now without difficulty; but there were thousands of\npeople in the city--non-combatants, women and children--and to murder them\nto no purpose was not the sort of warfare we cared to make.\n\nIt seemed probable that Tao had evacuated his position. The valley beyond\nthe city led up into the mountains toward the Dark City, almost on the\nborderland of the frozen wastes of the Dark Country. Tao had protected\nthis valley from behind so that we had been unable to penetrate it without\nmaking a detour of over twenty miles. This I had not done, although had\nthe siege lasted longer I think with our next re\u00ebnforcement we should have\nattempted it.\n\nWith the extinguishing of the lights our long-range activities ceased. We\nanticipated some trick, and for several days remained quiet. Our girls\ncould have flown over the city; but this I would not allow, fearing that a\nray would bring them suddenly down.\n\nMiela and myself, occupying one of the stone houses down by the river,\nheld a consultation there with Mercer and Anina.\n\nMercer, as usual, was for instant action.\n\n\"We might as well march right in,\" he declared. \"They're out of business,\nor they've gone--one or the other.\"\n\n\"To the Dark City they have gone, I think,\" Anina said.\n\n\"I think so, too,\" Mercer agreed.\n\n\"_I'll_ go in alone on foot,\" I said, \"and find out what has happened.\"\n\nBut Miela shook her head.\n\n\"One who can fly will go more safely. I shall go.\"\n\n\"Not you, my sister,\" Anina said quietly. \"Warfare is not for you--now.\nThat you can understand, can you not? _I_ shall go.\"\n\nMercer insisted on accompanying her; and he did, part of the way, waiting\nwhile she flew close over the city. It was several hours before they\nreturned, reporting that the place was almost in ruins, and that Tao and\nhis men had fled some time before, leaving the light-barrage to burn\nitself out. The next day, with our men in the black cloth suits of armor\nmarching up the valley, and the girls with their black shields flying\noverhead, we took possession of all that remained of the Lone City.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\nTHE END OF TAO.\n\n\nThe scene of desolation that met us in the Lone City was at once\nextraordinary and awesome. It seemed impossible that our rays, acting for\nso brief a period, could have done so much damage. The city was nothing\nmore than a semicivilized settlement of little, flat-topped stone houses.\nOur rays, striking these, had discharged harmlessly into the ground. But\nthe interiors had been penetrated through windows and doors, and\neverything inflammable about them, as well as about the streets, had been\ndestroyed.\n\nThe people had taken refuge in cellars underground and in caves and\ncrevices--wherever they could find shelter. But even so, there were a\nthousand dead in that city that morning, and rapidly spreading disease\nwould shortly have killed them all. They came out of their hiding places\nlittle by little as we entered the streets, and stood about in groups\nstaring at us sullenly. They seemed mostly old men and women and children,\nthe younger men having fled with Tao's army. They were heavy-set, pathetic\npeople, with broad, heavy faces, pasty-white skin, and large protruding\neyes. We were in the Lone City nearly a month, burying the dead, doing\nwhat we could for the people, and destroying or removing the apparatus Tao\nhad left behind him.\n\nThe Lone City, before the banishment of Tao, had been one of the most\nprimitive settlements of the Twilight region. It was in the other\nhemisphere that the Twilight Country was more densely populated; but since\nthis Lone City was so close to the Great City it had become the scene of\nTao's exile.\n\nThis region about the Lone City was of the most barren of the whole\nTwilight country. Its people were almost entirely meat eaters. Back toward\nthe Dark Country great bands of animals like caribou roamed. Living almost\nentirely in darkness, they had little power of sight, and were easy prey\nto hunters.\n\nTheir hides, which were covered with short, white fur, provided clothing;\na form of candle was made from their fat, and used for lighting; and their\nflesh provided food. The Dark City, some two hundred and fifty miles away,\nwas the center from which most of these animals were obtained.\n\n\"Then, that's where Tao has been getting his supplies from,\" Mercer\nexclaimed, as we heard all this from one of the Twilight People. \"And\nthat's where he has gone now.\"\n\nTao had indeed withdrawn to the Dark City, we learned positively. And more\nthan that, we learned that he had factories there as well as here. We\nfound in the Lone City some eight of the interplanetary vehicles--most of\nthem almost entirely completed. The fact that Tao had abandoned them so\nreadily made us believe he had others in the Dark City.\n\nThere seemed a curious lack of appliances for protection against the ray.\nThis we attributed to two causes--that Tao had managed to take most of\nthem with him, and that his supply of fabric came from distant cities on\nthe other side of the globe. Within a month after we had occupied the Lone\nCity we were again ready to start forward. It had been an irksome month\nfor Mercer, and not a day had passed without my receiving a truculent\ndeclaration from him that we were fools to allow Tao to escape so easily.\n\nOur occupation of the Lone City was to continue. On this second expedition\nfarther into the Twilight Country I took with me a much smaller and more\nselect force. We had before us a land journey of some two hundred and\nfifty miles, through an unknown, barren country, in which it would be\ndifficult for us to maintain ourselves, so I was determined to be burdened\nwith as few men as possible.\n\nOur force consisted of all the older men trained in the operation of the\nlarger projectors and rockets; a variety of mechanics and helpers, men\nselected for their physical strength; a corps of young men to the number\nof fifty, and fifty girls.\n\nWe did not take the platforms, for I assumed it would be too cold for the\ngirls to make sustained flights. Against this cold we provided ourselves\nwell with the white furry garments of the Twilight People. I need not go\ninto details of our march to the Dark City. It occupied some three weeks.\nWe met with no opposition, passing a few isolated settlements, whose\ninhabitants rather welcomed us than otherwise.\n\nThis region we passed through took us almost to the ill-defined borders of\nthe Dark Country. It was not mountainous, but rather more a great broken\nplateau with a steady ascent. Each day it grew darker and colder, until at\nlast we entered perpetual night. It was not the sort of night we know on\nearth, but a Stygian blackness.\n\nWe used little torches now, of the light-ray current, and our little army,\ntrudging along in their lurid glare, and dragging its wagons piled high\nwith the projectors, presented a curious and weird picture. The country\nfor the most part was barren rock, with a few stunted trees growing in the\nravines and crevices. There was an abundance of water.\n\nWe encountered several rainstorms, and once during the last week it snowed\na little. Except for the storms, the wind held steady, a gentle breeze\nfrom the colder regions in front blowing back toward the Light Country\nbehind us.\n\nDuring the latter days of our journey I noticed a curious change in the\nground. It seemed now, in many places, to be like a soft, chalky\nlimestone, which ran in pockets and seams between strata of very hard\nrock. I called Miela's attention to it once, and she pointed out a number\nof irregular shaped, small masses of a substance which in daylight I\nassumed might be yellow. These were embedded in the soft limestone.\n\n\"Sulphur,\" she said. \"Like that on your earth. There is much of it up\nhere, I have heard.\"\n\nThe Dark City occupied a flat plateau, slightly elevated above the\nsurrounding country, and on the brink of a sheer drop of some six or seven\nthousand feet to an arm of the polar sea.\n\nOur problems now were very different from when we had laid siege to the\nLone City. The conformation of the country allowed us no opportunity to\napproach closer than two or three miles to the barrage of light we must\nexpect. We could not reach the city from these nearest points with our\nprojectors.\n\nThere were many lateral ravines depressed below the upper surface of the\nmain plateau, and though the light-rays from the city, directed\nhorizontally, would sweep their tops, we found we could traverse many of\nthem a considerable distance in safety. But from the bottoms of them we\ncould only fire our rockets without specific aim and our projectors not at\nall.\n\nOnly by the most fortuitous of circumstances did we escape complete\nannihilation the first moment we appeared within range. We had no idea\nwhat lay ahead--although the guides we had brought with us from the Lone\nCity informed us we were nearing our destination--and the scene remained\nin complete darkness until we were hardly more than five miles outside\nTao's stronghold.\n\nThen, without warning, his lights flashed on--not only a vertical barrage,\nbut a horizontal one as well--sweeping the higher points of the entire\ncountry around for a distance of twelve or fifteen miles.\n\nWe were, at the moment, following the bottom of a narrow gully. Had we\nbeen on any of the upper reaches of the plateau we would undoubtedly have\nbeen picked out by one of the roving beams of light and destroyed.\n\nWe camped where we were, and again for several days I attempted nothing,\ndevoting myself to a thorough exploration of the country about us. The\nDark City appeared impregnable. Beams of light from Tao's larger\nprojectors were constantly roaming about the entire plateau that\nsurrounded it, and every higher point of vantage from which one of ours\ncould have reached them must have been struck by their rays a score of\ntimes a day.\n\nIt will be understood, of course, that any place where we could mount one\nof the higher powered projectors, a task of several hours at best, and\nstrike the city, must of necessity be also within range of their rays, for\ntheirs were as powerful as ours. Upon observation I felt convinced that\nshould we attempt to mount a projector anywhere on these higher points it\nwould be sought out and destroyed long before we could bring it into\naction.\n\nThat this was Tao's stronghold, and not the Lone City, now became evident.\nI could readily understand why he had retreated here. Fully four times as\nmany projectors as he had in operation in the Lone City were now in\nevidence. Those of shorter range, and spreading rays, kept the entire\ncountry bathed in steady light for several miles around him, while the\nlarger ones--a hundred of them possibly--roved constantly over the black\nemptiness beyond.\n\nFrom our encampment we could advance but little farther. Fortunately,\nretreat was open to us; and once beyond the circle of steady light, we had\nno difficulty in moving about in the darkness, even though momentarily we\nfrequently were within range of the single light-beams, had they chanced\nto swing upon us.\n\nThis was the situation which, even Mercer agreed, appeared hopeless. We\nexplored the brink of the precipice below which lay the sea. It was a\nsheer drop of many thousand feet. Although a descent might have been made\ncloser to the Dark City, certainly it was not possible at any point we\ncould reach. We sent our girls down, and they reported that from below it\nappeared probable that access to the ocean was had by the Dark City some\nmiles farther along. They went but a short distance, for Tao's lights were\noccasionally sweeping about; and more than that, they could make but very\nshort flights, owing to the cold.\n\nTo starve Tao out appeared equally as impractical as a direct attack. With\nour little army we could not surround the city on a circumference of some\neighty miles. We might, indeed, have barred the several roads that entered\nit, but it seemed probable that if Tao wanted to come out he would come,\nfor all we could do to stop him. And yet to starve him out seemed our only\npossible plan.\n\n\"We'll have to send back for re\u00ebnforcements,\" I told Mercer, Miela and\nAnina at one of our many conferences. \"An army of several thousand, if we\ncan maintain it up here.\"\n\nAnd then, the very next day, Mercer and Anina came forward with their\ndiscovery. We had set up our encampment of little black fabric tents in a\nravine some six miles outside the city, securely hidden by surrounding\ncliffs. Above us across the black sky the greenish-red beams of Tao's\nlight-rays swept continually to and fro. Miela and I were sitting together\ndisconsolately in our tent, reviewing the situation, when Mercer and Anina\nburst in. They had been roaming about together, exploring the country, and\ncame in now full of excitement and enthusiasm to tell us what they had\nfound. We two were to accompany them. They would tell us no more than\nthat; and as soon as we had all eaten we started off. It would be a trip\nof several hours, Mercer said, and would take us around to the other side\nand partly behind the Dark City.\n\nWe followed no road, but scrambled along over the open country, picking\nour way as best we could, and using the lights from the city to give us\ndirection. The two girls half walked, half flew, and Mercer and I, with\nour ability to take huge leaps, made rapid progress.\n\nThe night was black--that unluminous blackness that seems to swallow\neverything, even objects near at hand. We made our way along, using little\nhand searchlights that threw a red glare a short distance before us.\n\nWe kept down in the gulleys as much as possible, avoiding the higher\nplaces where Tao's long-range beams were constantly striking, and passed\naround in front of the Dark City, keeping always at least five miles away.\n\nWe had been traveling two or three hours, and still Mercer and Anina gave\nus no clew to what we were about to see. It began to snow. Huge, soft\nflakes soon lay thick on the ground.\n\n\"Mercer, where are you taking us?\" I exclaimed once.\n\n\"You shall see very soon now,\" Anina answered me. \"What we have found,\nOllie and I--and our plan--you shall understand it soon.\"\n\nWe had to be content with that. An hour later we found ourselves well\naround behind the Dark City and hardly more than four miles outside it. A\ngreat jagged cliff-face, two hundred feet high perhaps, fronted us. We, at\nits base, were on comparatively low ground here, with another low line of\ncliffs shading us from the light-beams of the city.\n\nMercer and Anina stopped and pointed upward at the cliff. A huge seam of\nthe soft, chalky limestone ran laterally for five hundred feet or more\nacross its face. I saw embedded in this seam great irregular masses of\nsulphur.\n\n\"There you are,\" said Mercer triumphantly. \"Sulphur--stacks of it. All we\nhave to do is set fire to it. With the wind blowing this way--right toward\nthe city--\" His gesture was significant.\n\nThe feasibility of the plan struck us at once. It was an enormous deposit\nof free sulphur. From this point the prevailing wind blew directly across\nthe city. The sulphur lay in great masses sufficiently close together so\nthat if we were to set fire to it in several places with our small\nlight-ray torches we could be assured of its burning steadily. And its\nfumes, without warning, blowing directly over the city--I shuddered as the\nwhole thing became clear to me.\n\n\"Good God, man--\"\n\n\"That'll smoke 'em out,\" declared Mercer, waving his hand again toward the\ncliff. \"I ask you now, won't that smoke 'em out?\"\n\n\"Tao's men--yes.\" Miela's face was grave as she answered Mercer's\ntriumphant question. \"It will do that, Ollie. Kill them all, of a\ncertainty; but that whole city there--\"\n\nMercer stared at his feet, toying idly with the little torch in his hand.\n\n\"Can you think of any other way to get at Tao?\" he asked.\n\nAnina met my eyes steadily.\n\n\"There is no other way,\" she said quietly. \"It must be done. It is your\nworld--your people--we must think of now. And you know there is no other\nway.\"\n\nWe decided at last to try it. Once we had made the decision, we proceeded\nas quickly as possible to put the plan into execution. We moved our\nencampment farther away, well out of danger from the fumes.\n\nWe mounted several of the projectors in positions where their rays could\nreach the surrounding country, and the sky, although not the city itself.\nThen, ordering our men and girls to hold themselves in readiness for\nwhatever might occur, we four went off together to fire the sulphur.\n\nThe wind was blowing directly toward the city as we stood at the base of\nthe cliff, a silent little group. I think that now, at this moment, we all\nof us hesitated in awe at what we were about to do.\n\nMercer broke the tension.\n\n\"Come on, Alan--let's start it off. Now is the time--a lot of places at\nonce.\"\n\nWe flashed on our little light-rays, and in a moment the sulphur was on\nfire at a score of different points. We drew off a few hundred feet to one\nside and sat down to watch it in the darkness. Overhead Tao's red beams\nswept like giant search-lights across the inky sky.\n\nThe sulphur started burning with tiny little spots of wavering blue flame\nthat seemed, many of them, about to die away. Gradually they grew larger,\nspreading out slowly and silently in ever-widening circles. Under the heat\nof the flames the sulphur masses became molten, turned into a viscous dark\nred fluid that boiled and bubbled heavily and dropped spluttering upon the\nground.\n\nSlowly the blue-green flames spread about, joining each other and making\nmore rapid headway--a dozen tiny volcanoes vomiting their deadly fumes and\npouring forth their sluggish, boiling lava. The scene about us now was\nlighted in a horrible blue-green glare. A great cloud of thin smoke\ngathered, hung poised a moment, and then rolled slowly away--its deadly\nfumes hanging low to the ground and spreading ever wider as though eager\nto clutch the unsuspecting city in their deadly embrace.\n\nThe entire face of the cliff was now covered with the crawling blue fire,\nlapping avidly about with its ten-foot tongues. We drew back, staring\nsilently at each other's ghastly green faces.\n\n\"Let's--let's get away,\" Mercer whispered finally. \"No use staying here\nnow.\"\n\nWe hurried back to the nearest place where one of our projectors was set\nup. The two men guarding it looked at us anxiously, and smiled\ntriumphantly when Miela told them what we had done. We stood beside them a\nmoment, then Miela and I climbed to an eminence near by from which we had\nan unobstructed view of the city.\n\nThe light-barrage still held steady. The individual, higher-powered\nprojectors as before swung their beams lazily about the country. We sat\npartly in the shelter of a huge bowlder, behind which we could have\ndropped quickly had one of them turned our way.\n\n\"Soon it will be there,\" Miela said softly, when we had been sitting quiet\nfor a time.\n\nI did not answer. It was indeed too solemn a thing for words, this\nwatching from the darkness while an invisible death, let loose by our own\nhands, stole down upon our complacent enemies.\n\nA few moments more we watched--and still the scene before us showed no\nchange. Then, abruptly, the lights seemed to waver; some of the beams\nswung hurriedly to and fro, then remained motionless in unusual positions,\nas though the men at their levers in sudden panic had abandoned them.\n\nMy heart was beating violently. What hidden tragedy was being enacted\nbehind that silent barrier of light? I shuddered as my imagination\nconjured up hideous pictures of that unseen death that now must be\nstalking about those city streets, entering those homes, polluting the air\nwith its stifling, noisome breath, and that even at this distance seemed\nclutching at my own lungs.\n\nI suppose the whole thing _did_ last only a moment. There was little in\nwhat we saw of significance had we not known. But we did know--and the\nknowledge left us trembling and unnerved.\n\nI leaped to my feet, pulling Miela after me, and in a few moments more we\nwere back beside the projector we had left with Mercer and Anina. Suddenly\na white shape appeared in the sky over the city. It passed perilously\nclose above the shattered light-barrage and came sailing out in our\ndirection.\n\nMercer jumped for the projector, but I was nearer, and in a moment I had\nflashed it on.\n\n\"It's Tao!\" Mercer shouted. \"He--\"\n\nIt was one of Tao's interplanetary vehicles, rising slowly in a great arc\nabove us. I swung our light-beams upward; it swept across the sky and fell\nupon the white shape; the thing seemed to poise in its flight, as though\nheld by the little red circle of light that fastened upon it, boring its\nway in. Then, slowly at first, it fell; faster and faster it dropped,\nuntil it struck the ground with a great crash--the first and only sound of\nall this soundless warfare.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was three days before the great sulphur deposit we had ignited burned\nitself out. The lights of the city had all died away, and blackness such\nas I never hope to experience again settled down upon the scene.\n\nWe approached the Dark City then; we even entered one or two of its\noutlying houses;, but beyond that we did not go, for we had made certain\nof what we wanted to know.\n\nI remember my father once describing how, when a young man, he had gone to\nthe little island of Martinique shortly after the great volcanic outbreak\nof Mount Pel\u00e9e. I remember his reluctance to dwell upon the scenes he saw\nthere in that silent city of St. Pierre--the houses with their dead\noccupants, stricken as they were sitting about the family table; the\nmotionless forms in the streets, lying huddled where death had overtaken\nthem in their sudden panic. That same reluctance silences me now, for one\ndoes not voluntarily dwell upon such scenes as those.\n\nA day or so later we found the interplanetary projectile which had sought\nto escape. Amid its wreckage lay the single, broken form of Tao--that\nleader who, plotting the devastation of two worlds for his own personal\ngain, had at the very last deserted his comrades and met his death alone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\nTHE RETURN.\n\n\nThere is but little more to add. With the death of Tao and the changing of\nthe law concerning the virgins' wings, my mission on Mercury was over. But\nI did not think of that then, for with the war ended, my position as\nvirtual ruler of the Light Country still held Mercer and me occupied with\na multiplicity of details. It was a month or more after our return from\nthe Twilight Country that Miela reminded me of father and my duty to him.\n\"You have forgotten, my husband. But I have not. Your world--it calls you\nnow. You must go back.\"\n\nGo back home--to father and dear little Beth! I had not realized how much\nI had wanted it.\n\n\"What you have done for our nation--for our girls--can never be repaid,\nAlan. And you can do more in later years, perhaps. But now your father\nneeds you--and we must think of him.\"\n\nI cast aside every consideration of what changes would first have to be\nmade here on Mercury, and decided in that moment to go.\n\n\"But you must go with me, Miela,\" I said, and then, as I thought of\nsomething else, I added gently: \"You will, won't you, little wife? For you\nknow I cannot leave you now.\"\n\nShe smiled her tender little smile.\n\n\"'Whither thou goest, I will go,' my husband,\" she quoted softly, \"'for\nthy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.'\"\n\nWe were ready to start at the time of the next inferior conjunction of\nMercury with the earth. At our combined pleading, and with the permission\nof his associates, Fuero was persuaded to take command of the nation\nduring my absence; and I felt I was leaving affairs in able hands.\n\nLua refused to accompany us; but she urged Anina to go, and the little\ngirl was ready enough to take advantage of her mother's permission.\n\nThough he said nothing, I shall never forget Mercer's face as this\ndecision was made.\n\nThe vehicle in which Miela had made her former trip was still lying in the\nvalley where we had left it. We went away privately, only Lua and Fuero\naccompanying us out of the city.\n\nLua parted with her two daughters quietly. Her emotions at seeing them go\nshe concealed under that sweet, gentle reserve which was characteristic of\nher always.\n\n\"Promise me you will be careful of her, Alan,\" she said softly as she\nkissed me at parting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe landed in the Chilean Andes, with that patient statue of the Christ to\nwelcome us back to earth. The Trans-Andean Railroad runs near it, and we\nsoon were in the city of Buenos Aires. The two girls, with wings shrouded\nin their long cloaks, walked about its crowded streets with a wonderment\nI can only vaguely imagine. We had only what little money I had taken with\nme to Mercury. I interviewed a prominent banker of the city, told him in\nconfidence who I was, and from him obtained necessary funds.\n\nWe cabled father then, and he answered at once that he would come down and\njoin us. We waited for him down there, and in another month he was with\nus--dear old gentleman, leaning over the steamer rail, trying to hold back\nthe tears of joy that sprang into his eyes at sight of me. Little Beth was\nwith him, too, smart and stylish as ever, and good old Bob Trevor, whom\nshe shyly presented as her husband.\n\nThe beach at Mar del Plata, near Buenos Aires, is one of the most\nbeautiful spots in South America; and on a clear moonlit night, with the\nSouthern Cross overhead, it displays the starry heavens as few other\nplaces can on this earth.\n\nOn such a night in February, 1942, Mercer and Anina sat together on the\nsand, apart from the gay throng that crowded the pavilion below them. The\ngirl was dressed all in white, with a long black cape covering her wings.\nHer beautiful blond hair was piled on her head in huge soft coils, and\nover it she had thrown a filmy, sky-blue mantilla that shone with a soft\nluster in the moonlight and seemed reflected in the blue of her eyes.\n\nMercer in white flannels sat beside her, cross-legged on the white sand,\nwith a newly purchased Hawaiian guitar across his lap. From the band stand\nin the pavilion down the beach faint strains of music floated up to them.\nThe moon silvered the water before them; a soft, gentle breeze of summer\ncaressed their cheeks; the myriad stars glittered overhead like brilliant\ngems scattered on the turquoise velvet of the sky.\n\nAnina, chin cupped in her hand, sat staring at the wonderful heavens that\nall her life before had been withheld from her sight. She sighed\ntremulously.\n\n\"I want to say this is a night,\" Mercer declared, breaking a long silence.\n\n\"It's--it's beautiful,\" she answered softly. \"Those millions of\nworlds--like mine, perhaps--or like this one of yours.\" She turned to him.\n\"Ollie, which of them is my world?\"\n\n\"You can't see it now, Anina. It's too close to the sun.\"\n\nAgain she sighed. \"I'm sorry for that. It would seem closer, perhaps, if\nwe could see it.\"\n\n\"You're not sorry you came, Anina? You don't want to go back now?\"\n\n\"Not now, Ollie.\" She smiled into his earnest, pleading eyes. \"For those I\nlove are here as well as there. I have Miela and Alan--and--\"\n\n\"And?\" Mercer leaned forward eagerly.\n\n\"And Miela's little son--that darling little baby. We must go back soon\nand see Miela. She will be wondering where we are.\"\n\nMercer sat back. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Yes, we must.\"\n\nThe band in the pavilion stopped its music. Mercer slid his little steel\ncross-piece over the guitar strings and began to play the haunting, crying\nmusic of the islands, the music of moonlight and love. After a moment he\nstopped abruptly.\n\n\"Anina, that little song you sang in the boat that day--you remember--the\nday we went to the Water City? Sing it again, Anina.\"\n\nShe sang it through softly, just as she had in the boat, to its last\nending little half-sob.\n\nMercer laid his guitar on the sand beside him.\n\n\"You said that music talks to you, Anina--though sometimes you--you don't\nunderstand just what it tries to say. I feel it that way, too--only--only\nto-night--now--I think I _do_ understand.\"\n\nHis voice was very soft and earnest and just a trifle husky.\n\n\"You said that it was a love-song, Anina, and it was sad because love is\nsad. Do you--think love is always sad?\" He put out his hand awkwardly and\ntouched hers.\n\n\"Do you, Anina?\" he whispered.\n\nHer little figure swayed toward him. She half turned, and in her shining\neyes he saw the light that needs no words to make its meaning clear.\n\nThe timidity that so often before had restrained him was swept away; he\ntook her abruptly into his arms, kissing her hair, her eyes, her lips.\n\n\"Love isn't--always very sad, is it, Anina?\"\n\nHer arms held him close.\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" she breathed against his shoulder. \"But it's--it's\nvery--wonderful.\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FIRE PEOPLE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 25780-8.txt or 25780-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/5/7/8/25780\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
