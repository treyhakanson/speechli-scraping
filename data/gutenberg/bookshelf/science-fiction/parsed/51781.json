The tank traps and\n              armored cars were the hazards of the trade!\n\n\nI stood in the shadows and looked across at the rundown lot with\nthe windblown trash packed against the wire mesh barrier fence and\nthe yellow glare panel that said HAUG ESCORT. There was a row of\ncity-scarred hacks parked on the cracked ramp. They hadn't suffered\nthe indignity of a wash-job for a long time. And the two-story frame\nbuilding behind them--that had once been somebody's country house--now\nshowed no paint except the foot-high yellow letters over the office\ndoor.\n\nInside the office a short broad man with small eyes and yesterday's\nbeard gnawed a cigar and looked at me.\n\n\"Portal-to-portal escort cost you two thousand C's,\" he said.\n\"Guaranteed.\"\n\n\"Guaranteed how?\" I asked.\n\nHe waved the cigar. \"Guaranteed you get into the city and back out\nagain in one piece.\" He studied his cigar. \"If somebody don't plug you\nfirst,\" he added.\n\n\"How about a one-way trip?\"\n\n\"My boy got to come back out, ain't he?\"\n\nI had spent my last brass ten-dollar piece on a cup of coffee eight\nhours before, but I had to get into the city. This was the only idea I\nhad left.\n\n\"You've got me wrong,\" I said. \"I'm not a customer. I want a job.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" He looked at me again, with a different expression, like a guy\nwhose new-found girl friend has just mentioned a price.\n\n\"You know Gra'nyauk?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"I grew up here.\"\n\nHe asked me a few more questions, then thumbed a button centered in a\nring of grime on the wall behind him. A chair scraped beyond the door;\nit opened and a tall bony fellow with thick wrists and an adams apple\nset among heavy neck tendons came in.\n\nThe man behind the desk pointed at me with his chin.\n\n\"Throw him out, Lefty.\"\n\nLefty gave me a resentful look, came around the desk and reached for my\ncollar. I leaned to the right and threw a hard left jab to the chin. He\nrocked back and sat down.\n\n\"I get the idea,\" I said. \"I can make it out under my own power.\" I\nturned to the door.\n\n\"Stick around, mister. Lefty's just kind of a like a test for\nseparating the men from the boys.\"\n\n\"You mean I'm hired?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"You come at a good time. I'm short of good boys.\"\n\nI helped Lefty up, then dusted off a chair and listened to a half-hour\nbriefing on conditions in the city. They weren't good. Then I went\nupstairs to the chart room to wait for a call.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was almost ten o'clock when Lefty came into the room where I was\nlooking over the maps of the city. He jerked his head.\n\n\"Hey, you.\"\n\nA weasel-faced man who had been blowing smoke in my face slid off his\nstool, dropped his cigarette and smeared it under his shoe.\n\n\"You,\" Lefty said. \"The new guy.\"\n\nI belted my coat and followed him down the dark stairway, and out\nacross the littered tarmac, glistening wet under the polyarcs, to where\nHaug stood talking to another man I hadn't seen before.\n\nHaug flicked a beady glance my way, then turned to the stranger. He\nwas a short man of about fifty with a mild expressionless face and\nexpensive clothes.\n\n\"Mr. Stenn, this is Smith. He's your escort. You do like he tells you\nand he'll get you into the city and see your party and back out again\nin one piece.\"\n\nThe customer looked at me. \"Considering the fee I'm paying, I sincerely\nhope so,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Smith, you and Mr. Stenn take number 16 here.\" Haug patted a\nhinge-sprung hood, painted a bilious yellow and scabbed with license\nmedallions issued by half a dozen competing city governments.\n\nHaug must have noticed something in Stenn's expression.\n\n\"It ain't a fancy-looking hack, but she's got full armor, heavy-duty\ngyros, crash-shocks, two-way music and panic gear. I ain't got a better\nhack in the place.\"\n\nStenn nodded, popped the hatch and got in. I climbed in the front and\nadjusted the seat and controls to give me a little room. When I kicked\nover the turbos they sounded good.\n\n\"Better tie in, Mr. Stenn,\" I said. \"We'll take the Canada turnpike in.\nYou can brief me on the way.\"\n\nI wheeled 16 around and out under the glare-sign that read \"HAUG\nESCORT.\" In the eastbound linkway I boosted her up to 90. From the way\nthe old bus stepped off, she had at least a megahorse under the hood.\nMaybe Haug wasn't lying, I thought. I pressed an elbow against the\npower pistol strapped to my side.\n\nI liked the feel of it there. Maybe between it and old 16 I could get\nthere and back after all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My destination,\" Stenn said, \"is the Manhattan section.\"\n\nThat suited me perfectly. In fact, it was the first luck I'd had since\nI burned the uniform. I looked in the rear viewer at Stenn's face.\nHe still wore no expression. He seemed like a mild little man to be\nwanting into the cage with the tigers.\n\n\"That's pretty rough territory, Mr. Stenn,\" I said. He didn't answer.\n\n\"Not many tourists go there,\" I went on. I wanted to pry a little\ninformation from him.\n\n\"I'm a businessman,\" Stenn said.\n\nI let it go at that. Maybe he knew what he was doing. For me, there was\nno choice. I had one slim lead, and I had to play it out to the end. I\nswung through the banked curves of the intermix and onto the turnpike\nand opened up to full throttle.\n\nIt was fifteen minutes before I saw the warning red lights ahead. Haug\nhad told me about this. I slowed.\n\n\"Here's our first roadblock, Mr. Stenn,\" I said. \"This is an operator\nnamed Joe Naples. All he's after is his toll. I'll handle him; you sit\ntight in the hack. Don't say anything, don't do anything, no matter\nwhat happens. Understand?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Stenn said mildly.\n\nI pulled up. My lights splashed on the spikes of a Mark IX tank trap. I\nset the parking jacks and got out.\n\n\"Remember what I told you,\" I said. \"No matter what.\" I walked up into\nthe beam of the lights.\n\nA voice spoke from off to the side.\n\n\"Douse 'em, Rube.\"\n\nI went back and cut the lights. Three men sauntered out onto the\nhighway.\n\n\"Keep the hands away from the sides, Rube.\"\n\nOne of the men was a head taller than the others. I couldn't see his\nface in the faint red light from the beacon, but I knew who he was.\n\n\"Hello, Naples,\" I said.\n\nHe came up to me. \"You know me, Rube?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"The first thing Haug told me was pay my respects to\nMr. Naples.\"\n\nNaples laughed. \"You hear that, boys? They know me pretty good on the\noutside, ha?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at me, not laughing any more. \"I don't see you before.\"\n\n\"My first trip.\"\n\nHe jerked a thumb at the hack. \"Who's your trick?\"\n\n\"A businessman. Name is Stenn.\"\n\n\"Yeah? What kind business?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"We don't quiz the cash customers, Joe.\"\n\n\"Let's take a look.\" Naples moved off toward the hack, the boys at\nhis side. I followed. Naples looked in at Stenn. Stenn sat relaxed\nand looked straight ahead. Naples turned away, nodded to one of his\nhelpers. The two moved off a few yards.\n\nThe other man, a short bullet-headed thug in a grease-spatted overcoat,\nstood by the hack, staring in at Stenn. He took a heavy old-style\nautomatic from his coat pocket, pulled open the door. He aimed the gun\nat Stenn's head and carefully squeezed the trigger.\n\nThe hammer clicked emptily.\n\n\"Ping,\" he said. He thrust the gun back in his pocket, kicked the door\nshut and went over to join Naples.\n\n\"Okay, Rube,\" Naples called.\n\nI went over to him.\n\n\"I guess maybe you on the level,\" he said. \"Standard fee. Five hundred,\nOld Federal notes.\"\n\nI had to be careful now. I held a bland expression, reached\nin--slowly--took out my wallet. I extracted two hundred-C notes and\nheld them out.\n\nNaples looked at them, unmoving. The thug in the dirty overcoat moved\nup close, and suddenly swung the edge of his palm at my wrist. I was\nready; I flicked my hand aside and chopped him hard at the base of the\nneck. He dropped.\n\nI was still holding out the money.\n\n\"That clown isn't worthy of a place in the Naples organization,\" I said.\n\nNaples looked down at the man, stirred him with his foot.\n\n\"A clown,\" he said. He took the money and tucked it in his shirt pocket.\n\n\"Okay, Rube,\" he said. \"My regards to Haug.\"\n\nI got in the hack and moved up to the barrier. It started up, trundled\naside. Naples was bending over the man I had downed. He took the pistol\nfrom the pocket of the overcoat, jacked the action and aimed. There was\na sharp crack. The overcoat flopped once. Naples smiled over at me.\n\n\"He ain't worthy a place in the Naples organization,\" he said.\n\nI waved a hand vaguely and gunned off down the road.\n\n\nII\n\nThe speaker in my ear hummed.\n\nI grunted an acknowledgement and a blurred voice said, \"Smith, listen.\nWhen you cross the South Radial, pick up the Midwest Feed-off. Take it\neasy and watch for Number Nine Station. Pull off there. Got it?\"\n\nI recognized the voice. It was Lefty, Haug's Number One boy. I didn't\nanswer.\n\n\"What was the call?\" Stenn asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"Nothing.\"\n\nThe lights of the South Radial Intermix were in sight ahead now.\n\nI slowed to a hundred and thought about it. My personal motives told\nme to keep going, my job as a paid Escort was to get my man where he\nwanted to go. That was tough enough, without detours. I eased back up\nto one-fifty, took the Intermix with gyros screaming, and curved out\nonto the thruway.\n\nThe speaker hummed. \"What are you trying to pull, wise guy?\" He sounded\nmad. \"That was the South Radial you just passed up--\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"That's right. Smitty takes 'em there and he brings 'em\nback. Don't call us, we'll call you.\"\n\nThere was a long hum from the speaker. \"Oh, a wiseacre,\" it said\nfinally. \"Listen, rookie, you got a lot to learn. This guy is\nbankrolled. I seen the wad when he paid Haug off. So all right, we cut\nyou in. Now, get this....\"\n\nHe gave me detailed instructions. When he was finished, I said, \"Don't\nwait up for me.\"\n\nI took the speaker out of my ear and dropped it into the disposal slot.\nWe drove along quietly for quite a while.\n\nI was beginning to recognize my surroundings. This section of the\nturnpike had been opened the year before I left home. Except for the\nlack of traffic and the dark windows along the way it hadn't changed.\n\nI was wondering just what Lefty's next move would be when a pair of\npowerful beams came on from the left, then pulled onto the highway,\nspeeding up to pace me. I rocketed past before he had made full speed.\nI heard a loud spang, and glass chips scattered on my shoulder. I\ntwisted and looked. A starred hole showed in the bubble, above the rear\nseat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Duck!\" I yelled. Stenn leaned over, put his head down.\n\nThe beams were gaining on me. I twisted the rear viewer, hit the I/R\nswitch. A three-ton combat car, stripped, but still mounting twin\ninfinite repeaters. Against that, old 16 was a kiddie car. I held my\nspeed and tried to generate an idea. What I came up with wasn't good,\nbut it was all I had.\n\nA half a mile ahead there should be a level-split, one of those awkward\nones that caused more than one pile-up in the first few months the\nturnpike was open. Maybe my playmates didn't know about it.\n\nThey were about to overtake me now. I slowed just a little, and started\nfading to the right. They followed me, crowding my rear wheel. I heard\nthe spang again, twice, but nothing hit me. I was on the paved shoulder\nnow, and could barely see the faded yellow cross-hatching that warned\nof the abutment that divided the pavement ahead.\n\nI held the hack in the yellow until the last instant, then veered right\nand cleared the concrete barrier by a foot, hit the down-curve at a\nhundred and eighty in a howl of gyros and brakes--and the thunderous\nimpact of the combat car.\n\nThen I was off the pavement, fighting the wheel, slamming through\nunderbrush, then miraculously back on the hard surface and coasting to\na stop in the clear.\n\nI took a deep breath and looked back. The burning remains of the car\nwere scattered for a quarter of a mile along the turnpike. That would\nhave been me if I had gauged it wrong.\n\nI looked at the canopy of the hack. Three holes, not a foot apart,\nright where a passenger's head would be if he were sitting upright.\nStenn was unconcernedly brushing glass dust from his jacket.\n\n\"Very neat, Mr. Smith,\" he said. \"Now shall we resume our journey?\"\n\n\"Maybe it's time you leveled with me, Stenn,\" I said.\n\nHe raised his eyebrows at me slightly.\n\n\"When Joe Naples' boy Friday pointed the gun at your head you didn't\nbat an eyelash,\" I said.\n\n\"I believe those were your instructions,\" Stenn said mildly.\n\n\"Pretty good for a simple businessman. I don't see you showing any\nsigns of the shakes now, either, after what some might call a harrowing\nexperience.\"\n\n\"I have every confidence in your handling--\"\n\n\"Nuts, Stenn. Those three holes are pretty well grouped, wouldn't you\nsay? The man that put them there was hitting where he was aiming. And\nhe was aiming for you.\"\n\n\"Why me?\" Stenn looked almost amused.\n\n\"I thought it was a little shakedown crew, out to teach me a lesson,\" I\nsaid. \"Until I saw where the shots were going.\"\n\nStenn looked at me thoughtfully. He reached up and took a micro-speaker\nfrom his ear.\n\n\"The twin to the one you rashly disposed of,\" he said. \"Mr. Haug was\nkind enough to supply it--for a fee. I must tell you that I had a gun\nin my hand as we approached the South Radial Intermix. Had you accepted\nthe invitation to turn off, I would have halted the car, shot you and\ngone on alone. Happily, you chose to resist the temptation, for reasons\nof your own....\" He looked at me inquiringly.\n\n\"Maybe I'm sap enough to take the job seriously,\" I said.\n\n\"That may possibly be true,\" Stenn said.\n\n\"What's your real errand here, Stenn? Frankly, I don't have time to get\ninvolved.\"\n\n\"Really? One wonders if you have irons in the fire, Smith. But never\nmind. I shan't pry. Are we going on?\"\n\nI gave him my stern penetrating look.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"We're going on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn twenty minutes, we were on the Inner Concourse and the polyarcs were\nclose together, lighting the empty sweep of banked pavement. The lights\nof the city sparkled across the sky ahead, and gave me a ghostly touch\nof the old thrill of coming home.\n\nI doused that feeling fast. After eight years there was nothing left\nthere for me to come home to. The city had a lethal welcome for\nintruders; it wouldn't be smart to forget that.\n\nI didn't see the T-Bird until his spot hit my eyes and he was beside\nme, crowding.\n\nI veered and hit the brakes, with a half-baked idea of dropping back\nand cutting behind him, but he stayed with me. I had a fast impression\nof squealing metal and rubber, and then I was skidding to a stop up\nagainst the deflector rails with the T-Bird slanted across my prow. Its\nlid popped almost before the screech died away, and I was looking down\nthe muzzles of two power pistols. I kept both hands on the wheel, where\nthey could see them, and sat tight.\n\nI wondered whose friends we had met this time.\n\nTwo men climbed out, the pistols in sight, and came up to the hack.\nThe first one was a heavy-set Slavic type zipped into a tight G. I.\nweather suit. He motioned. I opened up and got out, not making any\nsudden movements. Stenn followed. A cold wind was whipping along\nthe concourse, blowing a fine misty rain hard against my cheek. The\npolyarcs cast black shadows on gray faces.\n\nThe smaller man moved over to Stenn and crowded him back against the\nhack. The Slav motioned again, and I moved over by the T-Bird. He\nfished my wallet out and put it in his pocket without looking at it.\nI heard the other man say something to Stenn, and then the sound of a\nblow. I turned my head slowly, so as not to excite my watchdog. Stenn\nwas picking himself up. He started going through his pockets, showing\neverything to the man with the gun, then dropping it on the ground. The\nwind blew cards and papers along until they soaked up enough water to\nstick. Stenn carried a lot of paper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gunny said something and Stenn started pulling off his coat. He\nturned it inside out, and held it out. The gunny shook his head, and\nmotioned to my Slav. He looked at me, and I tried to read his mind.\nI moved across toward the hack. I must have guessed right because\nhe didn't shoot me. The Slav pocketed his gun and took the coat.\nMethodically, he tore the lining out, found nothing, dropped the ripped\ngarment and kicked it aside. I shifted position, and the Slav turned\nand backhanded me up against the hack.\n\n\"Lay off him, Heavy,\" the other hood said. \"Maxy didn't say nothing\nabout this mug. He's just a Escort.\"\n\nHeavy started to get his gun out again. I had an idea he was thinking\nabout using it. Maybe that's why I did what I did. As his hand dipped\ninto his pocket, I lunged, wrapped an arm around him and yanked out my\nown artillery. I held onto a handful of the weather suit and dug the\npistol in hard. He stood frozen. Heavy wasn't as dumb as he looked.\n\nHis partner had backed a step, the pistol in his hand covering all of\nus.\n\n\"Drop it, Slim,\" I said. \"No hard feelings, and we'll be on our way.\"\n\nStenn stood absolutely motionless. He was still wearing his mild\nexpression.\n\n\"Not a chance, mug,\" the gunny said softly. No one moved.\n\n\"Even if you're ready to gun your way through your pal, I can't miss.\nBetter settle for a draw.\"\n\n\"Maxy don't like draws, mister.\"\n\n\"Stenn,\" I said. \"Get in the T-Bird. Head back the way we came, and\ndon't slow down to read any billboards.\"\n\nStenn didn't move.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Get going,\" I said. \"Slim won't shoot.\"\n\n\"I employed you,\" Stenn said, \"to take care of the heroics.\"\n\n\"If you've got any better ideas it's time to speak up, Stenn. This is\nyour only out, the way I see it.\"\n\nStenn looked at the man with the gun.\n\n\"You referred to someone named 'Maxy.' Would that by any chance be Mr.\nMax Arena?\"\n\nSlim looked at him and thought about it.\n\n\"Could be,\" he said.\n\nStenn came slowly over to the Slav. Standing well out of the line of\nfire, he carefully put a hand in the loose pocket of the weather suit\nand brought out the pistol. I saw Slim's eyes tighten. He was having to\nmake some tough decisions in a hurry.\n\nStenn moved offside, pistol in hand.\n\n\"Move away from him, Smith,\" he said.\n\nI didn't know what he had in mind, but it didn't seem like the time to\nargue. I moved back.\n\n\"Drop your gun,\" he said.\n\nI risked a glance at his mild expression.\n\n\"Are you nuts?\"\n\n\"I came here to see Mr. Arena,\" he said. \"This seems an excellent\nopportunity.\"\n\n\"Does it? I--\"\n\n\"Drop it now, Smith. I won't warn you again.\"\n\nI dropped it.\n\nSlim swiveled on Stenn. He was still in an awkward spot.\n\n\"I want you to take me to Mr. Arena,\" Stenn said. \"I have a proposition\nto put before him.\" He lowered the gun and handed it to Heavy.\n\nIt seemed like a long time until Slim lowered his gun.\n\n\"Heavy, put him in the back seat.\" He motioned me ahead, watched me as\nhe climbed in the T-Bird.\n\n\"Nice friends you got, mug,\" he said. The T-Bird started up, backed,\nand roared off toward the city. I stood under the polyarcs and watched\nthe tail glare out of sight.\n\nMax Arena was the man I had come to the city to find.\n\n\nIII\n\nOld number 16 was canted against the deflector rail, one side shredded\ninto curled strips of crumpled metal. I looked closer. Under the flimsy\nfairings, gray armor showed. Maybe there was more to Haug's best hack\nthan met the eye. I climbed in and kicked over the starter. The turbos\nsounded as good as ever. I eased the gyros in; she backed off the rail\nwith a screech of ripped metal.\n\nI had lost my customer, but I still had wheels.\n\nThe smart thing to do now would be to head back out the turnpike to\nHaug's lot, turn in my badge and keep moving, south. I could give up\nwhile I was still alive. All I had to do was accept the situation.\n\nI had a wide choice. I could sign on with the New Confeds, or the Free\nTexans, or any one of the other splinter republics trying to set up\nshop in the power vacuum. I might try to get in to one of the Enclaves\nand convince its Baron he needed another trained bodyguard. Or I could\ntake a post with one of the king-pins in the city.\n\nAs a last resort I could go back and find a spot in the Naples\norganization. I happened to know they had a vacancy.\n\nI was just running through mental exercises to hear myself think.\nI couldn't settle for the kind of world I had found when I touched\nplanet three months back, after eight years in deep space with Hayle's\nsquadron. When the Interim Administration shot him for treason, I\nburned my uniform and disappeared. My years in the Service had given me\na tough hide and a knack for staying alive; my worldly assets consisted\nof the clothes I stood in, my service pistol and a few souvenirs of my\ntravels. For two months I had been scraping along on the cash I had\nin my pocket, buying drinks for drifters in cheap bars, looking for a\nhint, any lead at all, that would give me a chance to do what had to be\ndone. Max Arena was the lead. Maybe a dud lead--but I had to find out.\n\nThe city lights loomed just a few miles away. I was wasting time\nsitting here; I steered the hack out into the highway and headed for\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nApparently Lefty's influence didn't extend far beyond the South Radial.\nThe two roadblocks I passed in the next five miles took my money,\naccepted my story that I was on my way to pick up a fare, said to say\nhello to Haug and passed me on my way.\n\nHaug's sour yellow color scheme seemed to carry some weight with the\ntown Organizations, too. I was well into the city, cruising along\nthe third level Crossover, before I had any trouble. I was doing\nabout fifty, watching where I was going and looking for the Manhattan\nIntermix, when a battered Gyrob four-seater trundled out across the\nfairway and stopped. I swerved and jumped lanes; the Gyrob backed,\nblocking me. I kicked my safety frame down and floor-boarded the hack,\nsteering straight for him. At the last instant he tried to pull out of\nthe way.\n\nHe was too late.\n\nI clipped him across his aft quarter, and caught a glimpse of the\nunderside of the car as it stood on its nose, slammed through the\ndeflector and over the side. Old 16 bucked and I got a good crack\nacross the jaw from the ill-fitting frame, and then I was screeching\nthrough the Intermix and out onto the Manhattan Third level.\n\nUp ahead, the glare panels at the top of the Blue Tower reared up\nhalf a mile into the wet night sky. It wasn't a hard address to find.\nGetting inside would be another matter.\n\nI pulled up a hundred yards from the dark cave they used to call\nthe limousine entrance and looked the situation over. The level was\ndeserted--like the whole city seemed, from the street. But there were\nlights in the windows, level after level of them stretching up and away\nas far as you could see. There were plenty of people in the city--about\nten million, even after the riots and the Food Scare and the collapse\nof legal government. The automated city supply system had gone on\nworking, and the Kingpins, the big time criminals, had stepped in and\nset things up to suit their tastes. Life went on--but not out in the\nopen. Not after dark.\n\nI knew almost nothing about Arena. Judging from his employees, he\nwas Kingpin of a prosperous outfit. The T-Bird was an expensive\nlate model, and the two thugs handled themselves like high-priced\ntalent. I couldn't expect to walk into his HQ without jumping a few\nhurdles. Maybe I should have invited myself along with Stenn and his\nnew friends. On the other hand, there were advantages to arriving\nunannounced.\n\nIt was a temptation to drive in, with the hack's armor between me and\nany little surprises that might be waiting, but I liked the idea of\nstaging a surprise of my own. I eased into drive and moved along to a\nparking ramp, swung around and down and stopped in the shadow of the\nretaining wall.\n\nI set the brake and took a good look around. There was nothing in\nsight. Arena might have a power cannon trained on me from his bedroom\nwindow, for all I knew, but I had to get a toe into the water sometime.\nI shut down the turbo, and in the silence popped the lid and stepped\nout. The rain had stopped, and the moon showed as a bright spot on the\nhigh mist. I felt hungry and a little bit unreal, as though this were\nhappening to somebody else.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI moved over to the side of the parking slab, clambered over the\ndeflector rail and studied the shadows under the third level roadway.\nI could barely make out the catwalks and service ways. I was wondering\nwhether to pull off my hard-soled shoes for the climb when I heard\nfootsteps, close. I gauged the distance to the hack, and saw I\ncouldn't make it. I got back over the rail and waited.\n\nHe came into sight, rangy, shock-haired and preternaturally thin in\ntight traditional dress.\n\nWhen he got close I saw that he was young, in his early twenties at\nmost. He would be carrying a knife.\n\n\"Hey, Mister,\" he whined. \"Got a cigarette?\"\n\n\"Sure, young fellow,\" I said, sounding a little nervous. I threw in a\nshaky laugh to help build the picture. I took a cigarette from a pack,\nput the pack back in my pocket, held the weed out. He strutted up to\nme, reached out and flipped the cigarette from my fingers. I edged back\nand used the laugh again.\n\n\"Hey, he liked that,\" the punk whined. \"He thinks that's funny. He got\na sense of humor.\"\n\n\"Heh, heh,\" I said. \"Just out getting a little air.\"\n\n\"Gimme another cigarette, funny man.\"\n\nI took the pack out, watching. I got out a cigarette and held it\ngingerly, arm bent. As he reached for it, I drew back. He snatched for\nit. That put him in position.\n\nI dropped the pack, clenched my two hands together, ducked down and\nbrought them up hard under his chin. He backflipped, rolled over and\nstarted crawling.\n\nI let him go.\n\nI went over the rail without stopping to think it over and crossed the\ngirder to the catwalk that ran under the boulevard above. I groped my\nway along to where the service way branched off for the Blue Tower,\nthen stopped and looked up. A strip of luminous sky showed between the\nthird level and the facade of the building. Anybody watching from the\nright spot would see me cross, walking on the narrow footway. It was a\nchance I'd have to take. I started to move out, and heard running feet.\nI froze.\n\nThe feet slid to a stop on the level above, a few yards away.\n\n\"What's up, Crackers?\" somebody growled.\n\n\"The mark sapped me down.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was interesting. I had been spotted and the punk had been sent to\nwelcome me. Now I knew where I stood. The opposition had made their\nfirst mistake.\n\n\"He was starting to cross under when I spot him,\" Crackers went on,\nbreathing heavily. \"He saps me and I see I can't handle him and I go\nfor help.\"\n\nSomeone answered in a guttural whisper. Crackers lowered his voice. It\nwouldn't take long now for reinforcements to arrive and flush me out.\nI edged farther and chanced a look. I saw two heads outlined above.\nThey didn't seem to be looking my way, so I started across, walking\nsilently toward a narrow loading platform with a wide door opening from\nit.\n\nBelow me, a lone light reflected from the wet pavement of the second\nlevel, fifty feet down; the blank wall of the Blue Tower dropped past\nit sheer to the glistening gutters at ground level. Then I was on the\nplatform and trying the door.\n\nIt didn't open.\n\nIt was what I should have expected. Standing in the full light from the\nglare panel above the entry, I felt as exposed as a fan-dancer's navel.\nThere was no time to consider alternatives. I grabbed my power pistol,\nflipped it to beam fire and stood aside with an arm across my face. I\ngave the latch a blast, then kicked the door hard. It was solid as a\nrock. Behind and above me, I heard Crackers yell.\n\nI beamed the lock again, tiny droplets of molten metal spattering like\nneedles against my face and hand. The door held.\n\n\"Drop it and lift 'em, mug,\" a deep voice yelled. I twisted to look up\nat the silhouettes against the deflector rail. I recognized the Slavic\nface of the man called Heavy. So he could talk after all.\n\n\"You're under my iron, mug,\" he called. \"Freeze or I'll burn you.\"\n\nI believed him, but I had set something in motion that couldn't stop\nnow. There was nothing to go back to; the only direction for me was on\nthe way I was headed--deeper into trouble. I was tired of being the\nmouse in a cat's game. I had taken the initiative and I was keeping it.\n\nI turned, set the power pistol at full aperture, and poured it to the\narmored door. Searing heat reflected from the barrier, smoke boiled,\nmetal melted and ran. Through the stink of burning steel, I smelled\nscorched hair--and felt heat rake the back of my neck and hands. Heavy\nwas beaming me at wide aperture, but the range was just too far for a\nfast kill. The door sagged and fell in. I jumped through the glowing\nopening, hit the floor and rolled to damp out my smouldering coat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got to my feet. There was no time now to stop and feel the pain of\nmy burns. They would expect me to go up--so I would go down. The Blue\nTower covered four city blocks and was four hundred stories high. There\nwas plenty of room in it for a man to lose himself.\n\nI ran along the corridor, found a continuous service belt and hopped\non, lay flat, rode it through the slot. I came out into the light of\nthe service corridor below, my gun ready, then down and around again.\nI saw no one.\n\nIt took ten minutes to cover the eighteen floors down to the\nsub-basement. I rolled off the belt and looked around.\n\nThe whole space was packed with automatics; the Blue Tower was a\nself-sufficient city in itself. I recognized generators, heat pumps,\nair plants. None of them were operating. The city services were all\nstill functioning, apparently. What it would be like in another ten or\ntwenty years of anarchy was anybody's guess. But when the city systems\nfailed the Blue Tower could go on on its own.\n\nGlare panels lit the aisles dimly. I prowled along looking for\nan elevator bank. The first one I found indicated the car at the\nhundred-eightieth floor. I went on, found another indicating the\ntwentieth. While I watched, the indicator moved, started down. I was\ngetting ready to duck when it stopped at the fifth. I waited; it didn't\nmove.\n\nI went around to the side of the bank, found the master switch. I went\nback, punched for the car. When the door whooshed open, I threw the\nswitch.\n\nI had to work fast now. I stepped into the dark car, reached up and\nslid open the access panel in the top, then jumped, caught the edge\nand pulled myself up. The glare panels inside the shaft showed\nme the pony power pack on top of the car, used by repairmen and\ninspectors when the main power was off. I lit a per-match to read the\nfine print on the panel. I was in luck. It was a through car to the\nfour-hundredth. I pushed a couple of buttons, and the car started up. I\nlay flat behind the machinery.\n\nAs the car passed the third floor feet came into view; two men stood\nbeyond the transparent door, guns in their hands, watching the car come\nup. They didn't see me. One of them thumbed the button frantically. The\ncar kept going.\n\nThere were men at almost every floor now. I went on up, passed the\nhundredth floor, the one-fiftieth, and kept going. I began to feel\nalmost safe--for the moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was gambling now on what little I knew of the Blue Tower from the old\ndays when all the biggest names congregated there. The top floor was a\nlavish apartment that had been occupied by a retired fleet admiral, a\nVice-President and a uranium millionaire, in turn. If I knew anything\nabout Kingpins, that's where Max Arena would hang his hat.\n\nThe elevator was slow. Lying there I had time to start thinking about\nmy burned hide. My scalp was hit worst, and then my hands; and my\nshoulders were sticking to the charred coat. I had been travelling on\nadrenalin since Heavy had beamed me, and now the reaction was starting\nto hit.\n\nIt would have to wait; I had work to do.\n\nJust below the three hundred and ninety-eighth floor I punched the\nbutton and the car stopped. I stood up, feeling dizzy. I grabbed for\nthe rungs on the wall, hung on. The wall of the shaft seemed to\nsway ... back....\n\nSure, I told myself. The top of the building sways fifteen feet in a\nhigh wind. Why shouldn't I feel it? I dismissed the thought that it was\ndead calm outside now, and started up the ladder.\n\nIt was a hard climb. I hung on tight, and concentrated on moving one\nhand at a time. The collar of my coat rasped my raw neck. I passed up\nthe 398th and 9th--and rammed my head smack against a dead end. No\nservice entry to the penthouse. I backed down to the 399th.\n\nI found the lever and eased the door open, then waited, gun in hand.\nNothing happened. I couldn't wait any longer. I pushed the door wide,\nstepped off into the hall. Still nobody in sight, but I could hear\nvoices. To my left a discreet stair carpeted in violet velvet eased up\nin a gentle curve. I didn't hesitate; I went up.\n\nThe door at the top was an austere slab of bleached teak. I tried the\npolished brass lever; the door swung open silently, and I stepped\nacross the threshold and was looking across a plain of honey-colored\ndown at a man sitting relaxed in a soft chair of pale leather.\n\nHe waved a hand cheerfully. \"Come on in,\" he said.\n\n\nIV\n\nMax Arena was a broad-shouldered six-footer, with clean-shaven blue\njaws, coarse gray-flecked black hair brushed back from a high forehead,\na deeper tan than was natural for the city in November, and very white\nteeth. He was showing them now in a smile. He waved a hand toward a\nchair, not even glancing at the gun in my hand. I admired the twinkle\nof light on the polished barrel of a Norge stunner at his elbow and\ndecided to ignore it too.\n\n\"I been following your progress with considerable interest,\" Arena said\ngenially. \"The boys had orders not to shoot. I guess Luvitch sort of\nlost his head.\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" I said, \"that a little skin graft won't clear up in a\nyear or so.\"\n\n\"Don't feel bad. You're the first guy ever made it in here under his\nown steam without an invitation.\"\n\n\"And with a gun in his hand,\" I said.\n\n\"We won't need guns,\" he said. \"Not right away.\"\n\nI went over to one of the big soft chairs and sat down, put the gun in\nmy lap.\n\n\"Why didn't you shoot as I came in?\"\n\nArena jiggled his foot. \"I like your style,\" he said. \"You handled\nHeavy real good. He's supposed to be my toughest boy.\"\n\n\"What about the combat car? More friends of yours?\"\n\n\"Nah,\" he said, chuckling easily. \"Some Jersey boys heard I had a\ncaller. They figured to knock him off on general principles. A nifty.\"\nHe stopped laughing. \"The Gyrob was mine; a remoted job. Nice piece of\nequipment. You cost me real dough tonight.\"\n\n\"Gee,\" I said. \"That's tough.\"\n\n\"And besides,\" he said, \"I know who you are.\"\n\nI waited. He leaned over and picked something off the table. It was my\nwallet.\n\n\"I used to be in the Navy myself. Academy man, believe it or not.\nAlmost, anyway. Kicked out three weeks before graduation. A frame.\nWell, practically a frame; there was plenty of guys doing what I was\ndoing.\"\n\n\"That where you learned to talk like a hood?\"\n\nFor a second Arena almost didn't smile.\n\n\"I am perfectly capable of expressing myself like a little gentleman,\nwhen I feel so inclined,\" he said, \"but I say to hell with it.\"\n\n\"You must have been before my time,\" I said.\n\n\"A year or two. And I was using a different name then. But that wasn't\nmy only hitch with the Service. When the Trouble started, I enlisted. I\nwanted some action. When the Navy found out they had a qualified Power\nSection man on their hands, I went up fast. Within fourteen months I\nwas a J. G. How about that?\"\n\n\"Very commendable.\"\n\n\"So that's how I knew about the trick I. D. under the emulsion on\nthe snapshot. You should have ditched it, Maclamore. Or should I say\nCaptain Maclamore?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mouth opened, but I couldn't think of a snappy answer to that one.\nI was in trouble. I had meant to play it by ear once I reached Arena\nto get the information I needed. That was out now. He knew me. He had\ntopped my aces before I played them.\n\nSuddenly Arena was serious. \"You came to the right man, Maclamore.\nYou heard I had one of your buddies here, right? I let the word leak;\nI thought it might bring more of you in. I was lucky to get Admiral\nHayle's deputy.\"\n\n\"What do you want with me?\"\n\nArena leaned forward. \"There were eight of you. Hayle and his aide,\nWolfgang, were shot when they wouldn't spill to the Provisional\nGovernment--or whatever that mob calls itself. Margan got himself\nkilled in some kind of tangle near Denver. The other four boys pulled a\nfast one and ducked out with the scout you guys came back in. They were\nriding dry tanks--the scout had maybe thirty ton/hours fuel aboard--so\nthey haven't left the planet. That leaves you stranded. With six sets\nof Federal law looking for you. Right?\"\n\n\"I can't argue with what's in the newspapers,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, I don't know. I got a couple newspapers. But here's where I\nsmell a deal, Maclamore. You want to know where that scout boat is.\nPlayed right, you figure you got a good chance of a raid on an arsenal\nor a power plant to pick up a few slugs of the heavy stuff; then you\nhigh-tail out, join up with the rest of the squadron and, with the\nordnance you pack, you can sit off and dictate the next move.\" Arena\nleaned back and took a deep breath. His eyes didn't leave me.\n\n\"Okay. I got one of you here. I found out something from him. He gave\nme enough I know you boys got something up your sleeve. But he don't\nhave the whole picture. I need more info. You can give it to me. If I\nlike what I hear, I'm in a position to help--like, for example, with\nthe fuel problem. And you cut me in for half. Fair enough?\"\n\n\"Who is it you've got?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Uh-uh.\"\n\n\"What did he tell you?\"\n\n\"Not enough. What was Hayle holding out? You birds found something out\nthere. What was it?\"\n\n\"We found a few artifacts on Mars,\" I said. \"Not Martian in origin;\nvisitors. We surveyed--\"\n\n\"Don't string me, Maclamore. I'm willing to give you a fair deal, but\nif you make it tough for me--\"\n\n\"How do you know I haven't got a detonator buried under my left ear,\" I\nsaid. \"You can't pry information out of me, Arena.\"\n\n\"I think you want to live, Maclamore. I think you got something you\nwant to live for. I want a piece of it.\"\n\n\"I can make a deal with you, Arena,\" I said. \"Return me and my shipmate\nto our scout boat. Fuel us up. You might throw in two qualified men to\nhelp handle the ship--minus their black-jacks, preferably--then clear\nout. We'll handle the rest. And I'll remember, with gratitude.\"\n\nArena was silent for a long moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yeah, I could do that, Maclamore,\" he said finally. \"But I won't. Max\nArena is not a guy to pick up the crumbs--or wait around for handouts.\nI want in. All the way in.\"\n\n\"This time you'll have to settle for what you can get, Arena.\" I put\nthe gun away and stood up.\n\nI had a feeling I would have to put it over now or not at all.\n\n\"The rest of the squadron is still out there. If we don't show, they'll\ncarry on alone. They're supplied for a century's operation. They don't\nneed us.\"\n\nThat was true up to a point. The squadron had everything--except fuel.\n\n\"You figure you got it made if you can get your hands on that\nscout-boat,\" Arena said. \"You figure to pick up fuel pretty easy by\nknocking off say the Lackawanna Pile.\"\n\n\"It shouldn't be too tough; a fleet boat of the Navy packs a wallop.\"\n\nArena tapped his teeth with a slim paper-cutter.\n\n\"You're worried your outfit will wind up Max Arena's private Navy,\nright? I'll tell you something. You think I'm sitting on top of the\nworld, huh? I own this town, and everybody in it. All the luxury and\nfancy dinners and women I can use. And you know what? I'm bored.\"\n\n\"And you think running the Navy might be diverting?\"\n\n\"Call it whatever you want to. There's something big going on out\nthere, and I don't plan to be left out.\"\n\n\"Arena, when I clear atmosphere, we'll talk. Take it or leave it.\"\n\nThe smile was gone now. Arena looked at me, rubbing a finger along his\nblue cheek.\n\n\"Suppose I was to tell you I know where your other three boys are,\nMaclamore?\"\n\n\"Do you?\" I said.\n\n\"And the boat,\" Arena said. \"The works.\"\n\n\"If you've got them here, I want to see them, Arena. If not, don't\nwaste my time.\"\n\n\"I haven't exactly got 'em here, Maclamore. But I know a guy that knows\nwhere they are.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I said.\n\nArena looked mad. \"Okay, I'll give it to you, Maclamore. I got a\npartner in this deal. Between us we got plenty. But we need what you\ngot, too.\"\n\n\"I've made my offer, Arena. It stands.\"\n\n\"Have I got your word on that, Maclamore?\" He stood up and came over\nto stand before me. \"The old Academy word. You wouldn't break that,\nwould you Maclamore?\"\n\n\"I'll do what I said.\"\n\nArena walked to his desk, a massive boulder of Jadeite, cleaved and\npolished to a mirror surface. He thumbed a key.\n\n\"Send him in here,\" he said.\n\nI waited. Arena sat down and looked across at me.\n\nThirty seconds passed and then the door opened and Stenn walked in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStenn glanced at me. \"Well,\" he said. \"Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"The Smith routine is just a gag,\" Arena said. \"His name is--Maclamore.\"\n\nFor an instant, I thought I saw a flash of expression on Stenn's face.\nHe crossed the room and sat down.\n\n\"Well,\" he said. \"A very rational move, your coming here. I trust you\nstruck a profitable bargain?\" He looked hard at me, and this time there\nwas expression. Hate, I would call it, offhand.\n\n\"Not much of a deal at that, Stenn,\" Arena said. \"The captain is a\ntough nut to crack. He wants my help with no strings attached. I think\nI'm going to buy it.\"\n\n\"How much information has he given you?\"\n\nArena laughed. \"Nothing,\" he said. \"Max Arena going for a deal like\nthat. Funny, huh? But that's the way the fall-out fogs 'em.\"\n\n\"And what have you arranged?\"\n\n\"I turn him loose, him and Williams. I figure you'll go along, Stenn,\nand let him have the three guys you got. Williams will tell him where\nthe Scout boat is, so there's no percentage in your holding out.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"What else is there?\" Arena spread his hands. \"They pick up the boat,\nfuel up--someplace--and they're off. And the captain here gives me the\nold Academy word he cuts me in, once he's clear.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Arena smiled comfortably; Stenn sat calmly,\nlooking at each of us in turn. I crossed my fingers and tried to look\nbored.\n\n\"Very well,\" Stenn said. \"I seem to be presented with a _fait\naccompli_....\"\n\nI let a long breath out. I was going to make it....\n\n\"... But I would suggest that before committing yourself, you take the\nprecaution of searching Mr. Maclamore's person. One never knows.\"\n\nI could feel the look on my face. So could Arena.\n\n\"So,\" he said. \"Another nifty.\" He didn't seem to move, but the stunner\nwas in his hand. He wasn't smiling now, and the stunner caught me\neasily.\n\n\nV\n\nThe lights came on, and I blinked, looking around the room.\n\nMy mementos didn't look like much, resting in the center of Arena's\npolished half-acre of desk top. The information was stored in the\nfive tiny rods, less than an inch long, and the projector was a flat\npolyhedron the size of a pill-box. But the information they contained\nwas worth more than all the treasure sunk in all the seas.\n\n\"This is merely a small sample,\" Stenn said. \"The star surveys are said\nto be unbelievably complete. They represent a mapping task which would\nrequire a thousand years.\"\n\n\"The angles,\" Arena said. \"Just figuring the angles will take plenty\ntime.\"\n\n\"And this is what you almost let him walk out with,\" Stenn said.\n\nArena gave me a slashing look.\n\n\"Don't let your indignation run away with you, Arena,\" Stenn said.\n\"I don't think you remembered to mention the fuel situation to Mr.\nMaclamore, did you?\"\n\nArena turned to Stenn, looming over the smaller man. \"Maybe you better\nbutton your lip,\" he said quietly. \"I don't like the way you use it.\"\n\n\"Afraid I'll lower you in the gentleman's esteem?\" Stenn said. He\nlooked Arena in the eye.\n\n\"Nuts to the gentleman's esteem,\" Arena said.\n\n\"You thought you'd squeeze me out, Arena,\" Stenn said. \"You didn't need\nme any more. You intended to let Maclamore and Williams go and have\nthem followed. There was no danger of an escape, since you knew they'd\nfind no fuel.\"\n\nHe turned to me. \"During your years in space, Mr. Maclamore, technology\nmoved on. And politics as well. Power fuels could be used to construct\nbombs. Ergo, all stations were converted for short half-life\nsecondaries, and the primary materials stored at Fort Knox. You would\nhave found yourself fuelless and therefore helpless. Mr. Arena would\nhave arrived soon thereafter to seize the scout-boat.\"\n\n\"What would he want with the boat without fuel?\" I asked.\n\n\"Mr. Arena was foresighted enough to stock up some years ago,\" Stenn\nsaid. \"I understand he has enough metal hoarded to power your entire\nsquadron for an indefinite time.\"\n\n\"Why tell this guy that?\" Arena asked. \"Kick him to hell out of here\nand let's get busy. You gab too much.\"\n\n\"I see that I'm tacitly reinstated as a partner,\" Stenn said. \"Most\ngratifying.\"\n\n\"Max Arena is no welcher,\" Arena said. \"You tipped me to the tapes, so\nyou're in.\"\n\n\"Besides which you perhaps sense that I have other valuable\ncontributions to make.\"\n\n\"I figure you to pull your weight.\"\n\n\"What are your plans for Mr. Maclamore?\"\n\n\"I told you. Kick him out. He'll never wise up and cooperate with us.\"\n\n\"First, you'd better ask him a few more questions.\"\n\n\"Why? So he'll blow his head off and mess up my rug, like....\" Arena\nstopped. \"You won't get anything out of him.\"\n\n\"A man of his type has a strong aversion to suicide. He won't die\nto protect trivial information. And if he does--we'll know there's\nsomething important being held out.\"\n\n\"I don't like messy stuff,\" Arena said.\n\n\"I'll be most careful,\" Stenn said. \"Get me some men in here to secure\nhim to a chair, and we'll have a nice long chat with him.\"\n\n\"No messy stuff,\" Arena repeated. He crossed to his desk, thumbed a\nlever and spoke to someone outside.\n\nStenn was standing in front of me.\n\n\"Let him think he's pumping you,\" he hissed.\n\n\"Find out where his fuel is stored. I'm on your side.\" Then Arena was\ncoming back, and Stenn was looking at me indifferently.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArena had overcome his aversion to messy stuff sufficiently to hit me\nin the mouth now and then during the past few hours. It made talking\npainful, but I kept at it.\n\n\"How do I know you have Williams?\" I said.\n\nArena crossed to his desk, took out a defaced snapshot.\n\n\"Here's his I. D.\" he said. \"Take a look.\" He tossed it over. Stenn\nheld it up.\n\n\"Let me talk to him.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"See how he feels about it,\" I mumbled. I was having trouble staying\nawake. I hadn't seen a bed for three days. It was hard to remember what\ninformation I was supposed to get from Arena.\n\n\"He'll join in if you do,\" Arena said. \"Give up. Don't fight. Let it\nhappen.\"\n\n\"You say you've got fuel. You're a liar. You've got no fuel.\"\n\n\"I got plenty fuel, wise guy,\" Arena yelled. He was tired too.\n\n\"Lousy crook,\" I said. \"Can't even cheat a little without getting\ncaught at it.\"\n\n\"Who's caught now, swabbie?\" Arena was getting mad. That suited me.\n\n\"You're a lousy liar, Arena. You can't hide hot metal. Even Stenn ought\nto know that.\"\n\n\"What else was in the cache, Maclamore?\" Stenn asked--for the hundredth\ntime. He slapped me--also for the hundredth time. It jarred me and\nstung. It was the last straw. If Stenn was acting, I'd help him along.\nI lunged against the wires, swung a foot and caught him under the ribs.\nHe oofed and fell off his chair.\n\n\"Don't push me any farther, you small-time chiselers,\" I yelled.\n\"You've got nothing but a cast brass gall to offer. There's no hole\ndeep enough to hide out power metal, even if a dumb slob like you\nthought of it.\"\n\n\"Dumb slob?\" Arena barked. \"You think a dumb slob could have built\nthe organization I did, put this town in his hip pocket? I started\nstock-piling metal five years ago--a year before the ban. No hole deep\nenough, huh? It don't need to be so deep when it's got two feet of lead\nshielding over it.\"\n\n\"So you smuggled a few tons of lead into the Public Library and filed\nit under Little Bo Peep.\"\n\n\"The two feet was there ahead of me, wisenheimer. Remember the\nPolaris sub that used to be drydocked at Norfolk for the tourists to\nrubberneck?\"\n\n\"Decommissioned and sold for scrap,\" I said. \"Years ago.\"\n\n\"But not scrapped. Rusted in a scrapyard for five years. Then I bought\nher--beefed up her shielding--loaded her and sank her in ten fathoms of\nwater in Cartwright Bay.\"\n\n\"That,\" Stenn said, \"is the information we need.\"\n\nArena whirled. Stenn was still sitting on the floor. He had a palm gun\nin his hand, and it was pointed at the monogram on Arena's silk shirt.\n\n\"A cross,\" Arena said. \"A lousy cross....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Move back, Arena.\" Stenn got to his feet, eyes on Arena.\n\n\"Where'd you have the stinger stashed?\"\n\n\"In my hand. Stop there.\"\n\nStenn moved over to me. Eyes on Arena, he reached for the twisted ends\nof wire, started loosening them.\n\n\"I don't want to be nosey,\" I said. \"But just where the hell do you fit\ninto this, Stenn?\"\n\n\"Naval Intelligence,\" Stenn said.\n\nArena cursed. \"I knew that name should have rung a bell. Vice Admiral\nStenn. The papers said you got yours when the Navy was purged.\"\n\n\"A few of us eluded the net.\"\n\nArena heaved a sigh.\n\n\"Well, fellows,\" he said--and jumped.\n\nStenn's shot went wild, and Arena left-hooked him down behind the\nchair. As he followed, Stenn came up fast, landed a hard left, followed\nup, drove Arena back. I yanked at my wires. Almost--\n\nThen Arena, a foot taller, hammered a brutal left-right, and Stenn\nsagged. Carefully Arena aimed a right cross to the jaw. Stenn dropped.\n\nArena wiped an arm across his face.\n\n\"The little man tried, Mister. Let's give him that.\"\n\nHe walked past my chair, stooped for Stenn's gun. I heaved, slammed\nagainst him, and the light chair collapsed as we went over. Arena\nlanded a kick, then I was on my feet, shaking a slat loose from the\ndangling wire. Arena stepped in, threw a whistling right. I ducked it,\nlanded a hard punch to the midriff, another on the jaw. Arena backed,\nbent over but still strong. I couldn't let him rest. I was after him,\ntook two in the face, ducked a haymaker that left him wide open just\nlong enough for me to put everything I had in an uppercut that sent him\nback across his fancy desk. He sprawled, then slid onto the floor.\n\nI went to him, kicked him lightly in the ribs.\n\n\"Where's Williams,\" I said. I kept kicking and asking. After five\ntries, Arena shook his head and tried to sit up. I put a foot in his\nface and he relaxed. I asked him again.\n\n\"You didn't learn this kind of tactics at the Academy,\" Arena whined.\n\n\"It's the times,\" I said. \"They have a coarsening effect.\"\n\n\"Williams was a fancy-pants,\" Arena said. \"No guts. He pulled the\nstopper.\"\n\n\"Talk plainer,\" I said, and kicked him again, hard--but I knew what he\nmeant.\n\n\"Blew his lousy head off,\" Arena yelled. \"I gassed him and tried scop\non him. He blew. He was out cold, and he blew.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Hypnotics will trigger it.\"\n\n\"Fancy goddam wiring job,\" Arena muttered, wiping blood from his face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got the wire and trussed Arena up. I had to clip him twice before I\nfinished. I went through his pockets, looked at things, recovered my\nsouvenirs. I went over to Stenn. He was breathing.\n\nArena was watching. \"He's okay, for crissake,\" he said. \"What kind of\npunch you think I got?\"\n\nI hoisted Stenn onto my shoulder.\n\n\"So long, Arena,\" I said. \"I don't know why I don't blow your brains\nout. Maybe it's that Navy Cross citation in your wallet.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Arena said. \"Take me with you.\"\n\n\"A swell idea,\" I said. \"I'll pick up a couple of tarantulas, too.\"\n\n\"You're trying for the hack, right?\"\n\n\"Sure. What else?\"\n\n\"The roof,\" he said. \"I got six, eight rotos on the roof. One\nhigh-speed job. You'll never make the hack.\"\n\n\"Why tell me?\"\n\n\"I got eight hundred gun boys in this building alone. They know you're\nhere. The hack is watched, the whole route. You can't get through.\"\n\n\"What do you care?\"\n\n\"If the boys bust in here after a while and find me like this....\nThey'll bury me with the wires still on, Maclamore.\"\n\n\"How do I get to the roof?\"\n\nHe told me. I went to the right corner, pushed the right spot, and a\npanel slid aside. I looked back at Arena.\n\n\"I'll make a good sailor, Maclamore,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't crawl, Arena,\" I said. I went up the short stair, came out onto\na block-square pad.\n\nArena was right about the rotos. Eight of them. I picked the four-place\nCad, and got Stenn tied in. He was coming to, muttering. He was still\nfighting Arena, he thought.\n\n\"... I'll hold ... you ... get out....\"\n\n\"Take it easy, Stenn,\" I said. \"Nothing can touch this bus. Where's the\nboat?\" I shook him. \"Where's the boat, Stenn?\"\n\nHe came around long enough to tell me. It wasn't far--less than an\nhour's run.\n\n\"Stand by, Admiral,\" I said. \"I'll be right back.\"\n\n\"Where ... you....\"\n\n\"We need every good man we can get,\" I said. \"And I think I know a guy\nthat wants to join the Navy.\"\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nAdmiral Stenn turned away from the communicator screen.\n\n\"I think we'd be justified in announcing victory now, Commodore.\" As\nusual, he sounded like a professor of diction, but he was wearing a big\ngrin.\n\n\"Whatever you say, chief,\" I said, with an even sappier smile.\n\nI made the official announcement that a provisional Congress had\naccepted the resignations of all claims by former office holders, and\nthat new elections would be underway in a week.\n\nI switched over to Power Section. The NCO in charge threw me a snappy\nhighball. Damned if he wasn't grinning too.\n\n\"I guess we showed 'em who's got the muscle, Commodore,\" he said.\n\n\"Your firepower demonstration was potent, Max,\" I said. \"You must have\nstayed up nights studying the tapes.\"\n\n\"We've hardly scratched the surface yet,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll be crossing back to _Alaska_ now, Mac,\" Stenn said.\n\nI watched him move across the half-mile void to the flagship. Five\nminutes later the patrol detail broke away to take up surveillance\norbits. They would be getting all the shore leave for the next few\nyears, but I was glad my squadron had been detailed to go with the\nflagship on the Deep Space patrol. I wanted to be there when we\nfollowed those star surveys back to where their makers came from. Stenn\nwasn't the man to waste time, either. He'd be getting under way any\nminute. It was time to give my orders. I flipped the communicator key\nto the squadron link-up.\n\n\"Escort Commander to Escort,\" I said. \"Now hear this....\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The King of the City, by Keith Laumer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE KING OF THE CITY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51781.txt or 51781.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/8/51781/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
