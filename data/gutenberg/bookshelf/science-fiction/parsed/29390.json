Knight_\n\n[Illustration: \"_I was dead._\"]\n\n  As Jerry's eyes fell on the creature's head, he shuddered--for the\n  face was nothing but bone, with dull-brown skin stretched taut over\n  it. A skeleton that was alive!\n\n\nIt was a wicked night, the night I met the man who had died. A bitter,\nheart-numbing night of weird, shrieking wind and flying snow. A few\nblack hours I will never forget.\n\n\"Well, Jerry, lad!\" my mother said to me as I pushed back from the table\nand started for my sheepskin coat and the lantern in the corner of the\nroom. \"Surely you're not going out a night like this? Goodness gracious,\nJerry, it's not fit!\"\n\n\"Can't help it, Mother,\" I replied. \"Got to go. You've never seen me\nmiss a Saturday night yet, have you now?\"\n\n\"No. But then I've never seen a night like this for years either. Jerry,\nI'm really afraid. You may freeze before you even get as far as--\"\n\n\"Ah, come now, Mother,\" I argued. \"They'd guy me to death if I didn't\nsit in with the gang to-night. They'd chaff me because it was too cold\nfor me to get out. But I'm no pampered sissy, you know, and I want to\nsee--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she retorted bitingly, \"I know. You want to go and bask in that\nelegant company. Our stove's just as good as the one down at that dirty\nold store,\" continued my persistent and anxious parent, \"and it's\ncertainly not very flattering to think that you leave us on a night like\nthis to--Who'll be there, anyway?\"\n\n\"Oh, the usual five or six I suppose,\" I answered as I adjusted the wick\nof my lantern, hearing as I did the snarl and cut of the wind through\nthe evergreens in the yard.\n\n\"That black-whiskered sphinx, Hammersly, will he be there?\"\n\n\"Yes, he'll be there, I'm pretty sure.\"\n\n\"Hm-m!\" she exclaimed, her expression now carrying all the contempt for\nmy judgment and taste she intended it should. \"Button your coat up good\naround your neck, then, if you must go to see your precious Hammersly\nand the rest of them. Have you ever heard that man say anything yet?\nDoes he speak at all, Jerry?\" Then her gentle mind, not at all\naccustomed to hard thoughts or contemptuous remarks, quickly changed.\n\"Funny thing about that fellow,\" she mused. \"He's got something on his\nmind. Don't you think so, Jerry?\"\n\n\"Y-es, yes I do. And I've often wondered what it could be. He\ncertainly's a queer stick. Got to admit that. Always brooding. Good\nfellow all right, and, for a 'sphinx' as you call him, likable. But I\nwonder what is eating him?\"\n\n\"What do you suppose it could be, Jerry boy?\" questioned Mother\nfollowing me to the door, the woman of her now completely forgetting her\nrecent criticisms and, perhaps, the rough night her son was about to\nstep into. \"Do you suppose the poor chap has a--a--broken heart, or\nsomething like that? A girl somewhere who jilted him? Or maybe he loves\nsomeone he has no right to!\" she finished excitedly, the plates in her\nhand rattling.\n\n\"Maybe it's worse than that,\" I ventured. \"P'r'aps--I've no right to say\nit--but p'r'aps, and I've often thought it, there's a killing he wants\nto forget, and can't!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI heard my mother's sharp little \"Oh!\" as I shut the door behind me and\nthe warmth and comfort of the room away. Outside it was worse than the\nwhistle of the wind through the trees had led me to expect. Black as\npitch it was, and as cold as blazes. For the first moment or two,\nthough, I liked the feel of the challenge of the night and the racing\nelements, was even a little glad I had added to the dare of the\nblackness the thought of Hammersly and his \"killing.\" But I had not gone\nfar before I was wishing I did not have to save my face by putting in an\nappearance at the store that night.\n\nEvery Saturday night, with the cows comfortable in their warm barn, and\nmy own supper over, I was in the habit of taking my place on the keg or\nbox behind the red-hot stove in Pruett's store. To-night all the snow\nwas being hurled clear of the fields to block the roads full between the\nold, zigzag fences. The wind met me in great pushing gusts, and while it\nflung itself at me I would hang against it, snow to my knees, until the\nblow had gone along, when I could plunge forward again. I was glad when\nI saw the lights of the store, glad when I was inside.\n\nThey met me with mock applause for my pluck in facing the night, but for\nall their sham flattery I was pleased I had come, proud, I must admit,\nthat I had been able to plough my heavy way through the drifts to reach\nthem. I saw at a glance that my friends were all there, and I saw too\nthat there was a strange man present.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA very tall man he was, gaunt and awkward as he leaned into the angle of\nthe two counters, his back to a dusty show-case. He attracted my\nattention at once. Not merely because he appeared so long and pointed\nand skinny, but because, of all ridiculous things in that frozen\ncountry, he wore a hard derby hat! If he had not been such a queer\ncharacter it would have been laughable, but as it was it was--creepy.\nFor the man beneath that hard hat was about as queer a looking character\nas I have ever seen. I supposed he was a visitor at the store, or a\nfriend of one of my friends, and that in a little while I would be\nintroduced. But I was not.\n\nI took my place in behind the stove, feeling at once, though I am far\nfrom being unsociable usually, that the man was an intruder and would\nspoil the evening. But despite his cold, dampening presence we were soon\nat it, hammer and tongs, discussing the things that are discussed behind\nhospitable stoves in country stores on bad nights. But I could never\nlose sight of the fact that the stranger standing there, silent as the\ngrave, was, to say the least, a queer one. Before long I was sure he was\nno friend or guest of anyone there, and that he not only cast a pall\nover me but over all of us. I did not like it, nor did I like him.\nPerhaps it would have been just as well after all, I thought, had I\nheeded my mother and stayed home.\n\nJed Counsell was the one who, innocently enough, started the thing that\nchanged the evening, that had begun so badly, into a nightmare.\n\n\"Jerry,\" he said, leaning across to me, \"thinkin' of you s'afternoon.\nReadin' an article about reincarnation. Remember we were arguin' it last\nweek? Well, this guy, whoever he was I've forgot, believes in it. Says\nit's so. That people _do_ come back.\" With this opening shot Jed sat\nback to await my answer. I liked these arguments and I liked to bear my\nshare in them, but now, instead of immediately answering the challenge,\nI looked around to see if any other of our circle were going to answer\nJed. Then, deciding it was up to me, I shrugged off the strange feeling\nthe man in the corner had cast over me, and prepared to view my\nopinions.\n\n\"That's just that fellow's belief, Jed,\" I said. \"And just as he's got\nhis so have I mine. And on this subject at least I claim my opinion is\nas good as anybody's.\" I was just getting nicely started, and a little\nforgetting my distaste for the man in the corner, when the fellow\nhimself interrupted. He left his leaning place, and came creaking across\nthe floor to our circle around the store. I say he came \"creaking\" for\nas he came he did creak. \"Shoes,\" I naturally, almost unconsciously\ndecided, though the crazy notion was in my mind that the cracking I\nheard did sound like bones and joints and sinews badly in need of oil.\nThe stranger sat his groaning self down among us, on a board lying\nacross a nail keg and an old chair. Only from the corner of my eye did I\nsee his movement, being friendly enough, despite my dislike, not to\nallow too marked notice of his attempt to be sociable seem inhospitable\non my part. I was about to start again with my argument when Seth\nSpears, sitting closest to the newcomer, deliberately got up from the\nbench and went to the counter, telling Pruett as he went that he had to\nhave some sugar. It was all a farce, a pretext, I knew. I've known Seth\nfor years and had never known him before to take upon himself the buying\nfor his wife's kitchen. Seth simply would not sit beside the man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that I could keep my eyes from the stranger no longer, and the next\nmoment I felt my heart turn over within me, then lie still. I have seen\n\"walking skeletons\" in circuses, but never such a man as the one who was\nthen sitting at my right hand. Those side-show men were just lean in\ncomparison to the fellow who had invaded our Saturday night club. His\nthighs and his legs and his knees, sticking sharply into his trousers,\nlooked like pieces of inch board. His shoulders and his chest seemed as\nflat and as sharp as his legs. The sight of the man shocked me. I sprang\nto my feet thoroughly frightened. I could not see much of his face,\nsitting there in the dark as he was with his back to the yellow light,\nbut I could make out enough of it to know that it was in keeping with\nthe rest of him.\n\nIn a moment or two, realizing my childishness, I had fought down my fear\nand, pretending that a scorching of my leg had caused my hurried\nmovement, I sat down again. None of the others said a word, each waiting\nfor me to continue and to break the embarrassing silence. Hammersly,\nblack-whiskered, the \"sphinx\" as my mother had called him, watched me\nclosely. Hating myself not a little bit for actually being the sissy I\nhad boasted I was not, I spoke hurriedly, loudly, to cover my confusion.\n\n\"No sir, Jed!\" I said, taking up my argument. \"When a man's dead, he's\ndead! There's no bringing him back like that highbrow claimed. The old\nheart may be only hitting about once in every hundred times, and if they\ncatch it right at the last stroke they may bring it back then, but once\nshe's stopped, Jed, she's stopped for good. Once the pulse has gone, and\nlife has flickered out, it's out. And it doesn't come back in any form\nat all, not in this world!\"\n\nI was glad when I had said it, thereby asserting myself and downing my\nfoolish fear of the man whose eyes I felt burning into me. I did not\nturn to look at him but all the while I felt his gimlety eyes digging\ninto my brain.\n\nThen he spoke. And though he sat right next to me his voice sounded like\na moan from afar off. It was the first time we had heard this thing that\nonce may have been a voice and that now sounded like a groan from a\nclosely nailed coffin. He reached a hand toward my knee to enforce his\nwords, but I jerked away.\n\n\"So you don't believe a man can come back from the grave, eh?\" he\ngrated. \"Believe that once a man's heart is stilled it's stopped for\ngood, eh? Well, you're all wrong, sonny. All wrong! You believe these\nthings. I _know_ them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis interference, his condescension, his whole hatefulness angered me. I\ncould now no longer control my feeling. \"Oh! You _know_, do you?\" I\nsneered. \"On such a subject as this you're entitled to _know_, are you?\nDon't make me laugh!\" I finished insultingly. I was aroused. And I'm a\nbig fellow, with no reason to fear ordinary men.\n\n\"Yes, I know!\" came back his echoing, scratching voice.\n\n\"How do you know? Maybe you've been--?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" he answered, his voice breaking to a squeak. \"Take a good\nlook at me, gentlemen. A good look.\" He knew now that he held the center\nof the stage, that the moment was his. Slowly he raised an arm to remove\nthat ridiculous hat. Again I jumped to my feet. For as his coat sleeve\nslipped down his forearm I saw nothing but bone supporting his hand. And\nthe hand that then bared his head was a skeleton hand! Slowly the hat\nwas lifted, but as quickly as light six able-bodied men were on their\nfeet and half way to the door before we realized the cowardliness of it.\nWe forced ourselves back inside the store very slowly, all of us rather\nashamed of our ridiculous and childlike fear.\n\nBut it was all enough to make the blood curdle, with that live, dead\nthing sitting there by our fire. His face and skull were nothing but\nbone, the eyes deeply sunk into their sockets, the dull-brown skin like\nparchment in its tautness, drawn and shriveled down onto the nose and\njaw. There were no cheeks. Just hollows. The mouth was a sharp slit\nbeneath the flat nose. He was hideous.\n\n\"Come back and I'll tell you my yarn,\" he mocked, the slit that was his\nmouth opening a little to show us the empty, blackened gums. \"I've been\ndead once,\" he went on, getting a lot of satisfaction from the weirdness\nof the lie and from our fear, \"and _I_ came back. Come and sit down and\nI'll explain why I'm this living skeleton.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe came back slowly, and as I did I slipped my hand into my outside\npocket where I had a revolver. I put my finger in on the trigger and got\nready to use the vicious little thing. I was on edge and torn to pieces\ncompletely by the sight of the man, and I doubt not that had he made a\nmove towards me my frayed nerves would have plugged him full of lead. I\neyed my friends. They were in no better way than was I. Fright and\nhorror stood on each face. Hammersly was worst. His hands were\ntwitching, his eyes were like bright glass, his face bleached and drawn.\n\n\"I've quite a yarn to tell,\" went on the skeleton in his awful voice.\n\"I've had quite a life. A full life. I've taken my fun and my pleasure\nwherever I could. Maybe you'll call me selfish and greedy, but I always\nused to believe that a man only passed this way once. Just like you\nbelieve,\" he nodded to me, his neck muscles and jaws creaking. \"Six\nyears ago I came up into this country and got a job on a farm,\" he went\non, settling into his story. \"Just an ordinary job. But I liked it\nbecause the farmer had a pretty little daughter of about sixteen or\nseventeen and as easy as could be. You may not believe it, but you can\nstill find dames green enough to fall for the right story.\n\n\"This one did. I told her I was only out there for a time for my health.\nThat I was rich back in the city, with a fine home and everything. She\nbelieved me. Little fool!\" He chuckled as he said it, and my anger,\nmounting with his every devilish word, made the finger on the trigger in\nmy pocket take a tighter crook to itself. \"I asked her to skip with me,\"\nthe droning went on, \"made her a lot of great promises, and she fell for\nit.\" His dry jaw bones clanked and chattered as if he enjoyed the\nbeastly recital of his achievement, while we sat gaping at him,\nbelieving either that the man must be mad, or that we were the mad ones,\nor dreaming.\n\n\"We slipped away one night,\" continued the beast. \"Went to the city. To\na punk hotel. For three weeks we stayed there. Then one morning I told\nher I was going out for a shave. I was. I got the shave. But I hadn't\nthought it worth while to tell her I wouldn't be back. Well, she got\nback to the farm some way, though I don't know--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What!\" I shouted, springing before him. \"What! You mean you left her\nthere! After you'd taken her, you left her! And here you sit crowing\nover it! Gloating! Boasting! Why you--!\" I lived in a rough country.\nAssociated with rough men, heard their vicious language, but seldom used\na strong word myself. But as I stood over that monster, utterly hating\nthe beastly thing, all the vile oaths and prickly language of the\ncountryside, no doubt buried in some unused cell in my brain, spilled\nfrom my tongue upon him. When I had lashed him as fiercely as I was able\nI cried: \"Why don't you come at me? Didn't you hear what I called you?\nYou beast! I'd like to riddle you!\" I shouted, drawing my gun.\n\n\"Aw, sit down!\" he jeered, waving his rattling hand at me. \"You ain't\nheard a thing yet. Let me finish. Well, she got back to the farm some\nway or another, and something over a year later I wandered into this\ncountry again too. I never could explain just why I came back. It was\nnot altogether to see the girl. Her father was a little bit of a man and\nI began to remember what a meek and weak sheep he was. I got it into my\nhead that it'd be fun to go back to his farm and rub it in. So I came.\n\n\"Her father was trying out a new corn planter right at the back door\nwhen I rounded the house and walked towards him. Then I saw, at once,\nthat I had made a mistake. When he put his eyes on me his face went\nwhite and hard. He came down from the seat of that machine like a flash,\nand took hurried steps in the direction of a doublebarrelled gun\nleaning against the woodshed. They always were troubled with hawks and\nkept a gun handy. But there was an ax nearer to me than the gun was to\nhim. I had to work fast but I made it all right. I grabbed that ax,\njumped at him as he reached for the gun, and swung--once. His wife, and\nthe girl too, saw it. Then I turned and ran.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gaunt brute before us slowly crossed one groaning knee above the\nother. We were all sitting again now. The perspiration rolled down my\nface. I held my gun trained upon him, and, though I now believed he was\ntotally mad, because of a certain ring of truth in that empty voice, I\nsat fascinated. I looked at Seth. His jaw was hanging loose, his eyes\nbulging. Hammersly's mouth was set in a tight clenched line, his eyes\nlike fire in his blue, drawn face. I could not see the others.\n\n\"The telephone caught me,\" continued our ghastly story-teller, \"and in\nno time at all I was convicted and the date set for the hanging. When my\ntime was pretty close a doctor or scientist fellow came to see me who\nsaid, 'Blaggett, you're slated to die. How much will you sell me your\nbody for?' If he didn't say it that way he meant just that. And I said,\n'Nothing. I've no one to leave money to. What do you want with my body?'\nAnd he told me, 'I believe I can bring you back to life and health,\nprovided they don't snap your neck when they drop you.' 'Oh, you're one\nof _those_ guys, are you?' I said then. 'All right, hop to it. If you\ncan do it I'll be much obliged. Then I can go back on that farm and do a\nlittle more ax swinging!'\" Again came his horrible chuckle, again I\nmopped my brow.\n\n\"So we made our plans,\" he went on, pleased with our discomfiture and\nour despising of him. \"Next day some chap came to see me, pretending he\nwas my brother. And I carried out my part of it by cursing him at first\nand then begging him to give me decent burial. So he went away, and, I\nsuppose, received permission to get me right after I was cut down.\n\n\"There was a fence built around the scaffold they had ready for me and\nthe party I was about to fling, and they had some militia there, too.\nThe crowd seemed quiet enough till they led me out. Then their buzzing\nsounded like a hive of bees getting all stirred up. Then a few loud\nvoices, then shouts. Some rocks came flying at me after that, and it\nlooked to me as though the hanging would not be so gentle a party after\nall. I tell you I was afraid. I wished it was over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The mob pushed against the fence and flattened it out, coming over it\nlike waves over a beach. The soldiers fired into the air, but still they\ncame, and I, I ran--up, onto the scaffold. It was safer!\" As he said\nthis he chuckled loudly. \"I'll bet,\" he laughed, \"that's the first time\na guy ever ran into the noose for the safety of it! The mob came only to\nthe foot of the scaffold though, from where they seemed satisfied to see\nthe law take its course. The sheriff was nervous. So cut up that he only\nmade a fling at tying my ankles, just dropped a rope around my wrists.\nHe was like me, he wanted to get it over, and the crowd on its way. Then\nhe put the rope around my neck, stepped back and shot the trap. Zamm! No\ntime for a prayer--or for me to laugh at the offer!--or a last word or\nanything.\n\n\"I felt the floor give, felt myself shoot through. Smack! My weight on\nthe end of the rope hit me behind the ears like a mallet. Everything\nwent black. Of course it would have been just my luck to get a broken\nneck out of it and give the scientist no chance to revive me. But after\na second or two, or a minute, or it could have been an hour, the\nblackness went away enough to allow me to know I was hanging on the end\nof the rope, kicking, fighting, choking to death. My tongue swelled, my\nface and head and heart and body seemed ready to burst. Slowly I went\ninto a deep mist that I knew then was _the_ mist, then--then--I was off\nfloating in the air over the heads of the crowd, watching my own\nhanging!\n\n\"I saw them give that slowly swinging carcass on the end of its rope\ntime enough to thoroughly die, then, from my aerial, unseen watching\nplace, I saw them cut it--me--down. They tried the pulse of the body\nthat had been mine, they examined my staring eyes. Then I heard them\npronounce me dead. The fools! I had known I was dead for a minute or two\nby that time, else how could my spirit have been gone from the shell and\nbe out floating around over their heads?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused here as he asked his question, his head turning on its dry and\ncreaking neck to include us all in his query. But none of us spoke. We\nwere dreaming it all, of course, or were mad, we thought.\n\n\"In just a short while,\" went on the skeleton, \"my 'brother' came\ndriving slowly in for my body. With no special hurry he loaded me onto\nhis little truck and drove easily away. But once clear of the crowd he\npushed his foot down on the gas and in five more minutes--with me\nhovering all the while alongside of him, mind you--floating along as\nthough I had been a bird all my life--we turned into the driveway of a\nsummer home. The scientific guy met him. They carried me into the house,\ninto a fine-fitted laboratory. My dead body was placed on a table, a\nhuge knife ripped my clothes from me.\n\n\"Quickly the loads from ten or a dozen hypodermic syringes were shot\ninto different parts of my naked body. Then it was carried across the\nroom to what looked like a large glass bottle, or vase, with an opening\nin the top. Through this door I was lowered, my body being held upright\nby straps in there for that purpose. The door to the opening was then\nplaced in position, and by means of an acetylene torch and some easily\nmelting glass, the door was sealed tight.\n\n\"So there stood my poor old body. Ready for the experiment to bring it\nback to life. And as my new self floated around above the scientist and\nhis helper I smiled to myself, for I was sure the experiment would prove\na failure, even though I now knew that the sheriff's haste had kept him\nfrom placing the rope right at my throat and had saved me a broken neck.\nI was dead. All that was left of me now was my spirit, or soul. And that\nwas swimming and floating about above their heads with not an\ninclination in the world to have a thing to do with the husk of the man\nI could clearly see through the glass of the bell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They turned on a huge battery of ultra-violet rays then,\" continued the\nhollow droning of the man who had been hanged, \"which, as the scientist\nhad explained to me while in prison, acting upon the contents of the\nsyringes, by that time scattered through my whole body, was to renew the\nspark of life within the dead thing hanging there. Through a tube, and\nby means of a valve entering the glass vase in the top, the scientist\nthen admitted a dense white gas. So thick was it that in a moment or two\nmy body's transparent coffin appeared to be full of a liquid as white as\nmilk. Electricity then revolved my cage around so that my body was\ninsured a complete and even exposure to the rays of the green and violet\nlamps. And while all this silly stuff was going on, around and around\nthe laboratory I floated, confident of the complete failure of the whole\nthing, yet determined to see it through if for no other reason than to\nsee the discomfiture and disappointment that this mere man was bound to\nexperience. You see, I was already looking back upon earthly mortals as\nbeing inferior, and now as I waited for this proof I was all the while\nfighting off a new urge to be going elsewhere. Something was calling me,\nbeckoning me to be coming into the full spirit world. But I wanted to\nsee this wise earth guy fail.\n\n\"For a little while conditions stayed the same within that glass. So\nthick was the liquid gas in there at first that I could see nothing.\nThen it began to clear, and I saw to my surprise that the milky gas was\ndisappearing because it was being forced in by the rays from the lights\nin through the pores into the body itself. As though my form was sucking\nit in like a sponge. The scientist and his helper were tense and taut\nwith excitement. And suddenly my comfortable feeling left me. Until then\nit had seemed so smooth and velvety and peaceful drifting around over\ntheir heads, as though lying on a soft, fleecy cloud. But now I felt a\nsudden squeezing of my spirit body. Then I was in an agony. Before I\nknew what I was doing my spirit was clinging to the outside of that\ntwisting glass bell, clawing to get into the body that was coming back\nto life! The glass now was perfectly clear of the gas, though as yet\nthere was no sign of life in the body inside to hint to the scientist\nthat he was to be successful. But I knew it. For I fought desperately to\nbreak in through the glass to get back into my discarded shell of a body\nagain, knowing I must get in or die a worse death than I had before.\n\n\"Then my sharper eyes noted a slight shiver passing over the white thing\nbefore me, and the scientist must have seen it in the next second, for\nhe sprang forward with a choking cry of delight. Then the lolling head\ninside lifted a bit. I--still desperately clinging with my spirit hands\nto the outside, and all the time growing weaker and weaker--I saw the\nbreast of my body rise and fall. The assistant picked up a heavy steel\nhammer and stood ready to crash open the glass at the right moment. Then\nmy once dead eyes opened in there to look around, while I, clinging and\ngasping outside, just as I had on the scaffold, went into a deeper,\ndarker blackness than ever. Just before my spirit life died utterly I\nsaw the eyes of my body realize completely what was going on, then--from\nthe inside now--I saw the scientist give the signal that caused the\nassistant to crash away the glass shell with one blow of his hammer.\n\n\"They reached in for me then, and I fainted. When I came back to\nconsciousness I was being carefully, slowly revived, and nursed back to\nlife by oxygen and a pulmotor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe terrible creature telling us this tale paused again to look around.\nMy knees were weak, my clothes wet with sweat.\n\n\"Is that all?\" I asked in a piping, strange voice, half sarcastic, half\nunbelieving, and wholly spellbound.\n\n\"Just about,\" he answered. \"But what do you expect? I left my friend the\nscientist at once, even though he did hate to see me go. It had been all\nright while he was so keen on the experiment himself and while he only\nhalf believed his ability to bring me back. But now that he'd done it,\nit kinda worried him to think what sort of a man he was turning loose of\nthe world again. I could see how he was figuring, and because I had no\nidea of letting him try another experiment on me, p'r'aps of putting me\naway again, I beat it in a hurry.\n\n\"That was five years ago. For five years I've lived with only just part\nof me here. Whatever it was trying to get back into that glass just\nbefore my body came to life--my spirit, I've been calling it--I've been\nwithout. It never did get back. You see, the scientist brought me back\ninside a shell that kept my spirit out. That's why I'm the skeleton you\nsee I am. Something vital is missing.\"\n\nHe stood up cracking and creaking before us, buttoning his loose coat\nabout his angular body. \"Well, boys,\" he asked lightly, \"what do you\nthink of that?\"\n\n\"I think you're a liar! A damn liar!\" I cried. \"And now, if you don't\nwant me to fill you full of lead, get out of here and get out now! If I\nhave to do it to you, there's no scientist this time to bring you back.\nWhen you go out you'll stay out!\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" he grimaced back to me, waving a mass of bones that\nshould have been a hand contemptuously at me, \"I'm going. I'm headed for\nShelton.\" He stalked the length of the floor and shut the door behind\nhim. The beast had gone.\n\n\"The dirty liar!\" I cried. \"I wish--yes--I wish I had an excuse to kill\nhim. Just think of that being loose, will you? A brute who would think\nup such a yarn! Of course it's all absurd. All crazy. All a lie.\"\n\n\"No. It's not a lie.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI turned to see who had spoken. Hammersly's voice was so unfamiliar and\nnow so torn in addition that I could not have thought he had spoken, had\nhe not been looking right at me, his glittering eyes challenging my\nassertion. Would wonders never cease? I asked myself. First this\noutrageous yarn, now Hammersly, the \"sphinx,\" expressing an opinion,\nlooking for an argument! Of course it must be that his susceptible and\nbrooding brain had been turned a bit by the evening we had just\nexperienced.\n\n\"Why Hammersly! You don't believe it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I not only believe it, Jerry, but now it's my turn to say, as he did, I\n_know_ it! Jerry, old friend,\" he went on, \"that devil told the truth.\nHe was hanged. He was brought back to life; and Jerry--I was that\nscientist!\"\n\nWhew! I fell back to a box again. My knees seemed to forsake me. Then I\nheard Hammersly talking to himself.\n\n\"Five years it's been,\" he muttered. \"Five years since I turned him\nloose again. Five years of agony for me, wondering what new devilish\ncrimes he was perpetrating, wondering when he would return to that\nlittle farm to swing his ax again. Five years--five years.\"\n\nHe came over to me, and without a word of explanation or to ask my\npermission he reached his hand into my pocket and drew out my revolver,\nand I did not protest.\n\n\"He said he was headed for Shelton,\" went on Hammersly's spoken\nthoughts. \"If I slip across the ice I can intercept him at Black's\nwoods.\" Buttoning his coat closely, he followed the stranger out into\nthe night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was glad the moon had come up for my walk home, glad too when I had\nthe door locked and propped with a chair behind me. I undressed in the\ndark, not wanting any grisly, sunken-eyed monster to be looking in\nthrough the window at me. For maybe, so I thought, maybe he was after\nall not headed for Shelton, but perhaps planning on another of his\nghastly tricks.\n\nBut in the morning we knew he had been going toward Shelton. Scientists,\ndoctors, and learned men of all descriptions came out to our village to\nsee the thing the papers said Si Waters had stumbled upon when on his\nway to the creamery that next morning.\n\nIt was a skeleton, they said, only that it had a dry skin all over it. A\nmummy. Could not have been considered capable of containing life only\nthat the snow around it was lightly blotched with a pale smear that\nproved to be blood, that had oozed out from the six bullet holes in the\nhorrid chest. They never did solve it.\n\nThere were five of us in the store that night. Five of us who know.\nHammersly did what we all wanted to do. Of course his name is not really\nHammersly, but it has done here as well as another. He is\nblack-whiskered though, and he is still very much of a sphinx, but he'll\nnever have to answer for having killed the man he once brought back to\nlife. Hammersly's secret will go into five other graves besides his\nown.\n\n\n\n\nMonsters of Moyen\n\n_By Arthur J. Burks_\n\n[Illustration: \"_Now,\" said Kleig hoarsely, \"watch closely, for\nGod's sake!_\"]\n\n  \"The Western World shall be next!\" was the dread ultimatum of the\n  half-monster, half-god Moyen!\n\n\n_Foreword_\n\n\nIn 1935 the mighty genius of Moyen gripped the Eastern world like a hand\nof steel. In a matter of months he had welded the Orient into an\nunbeatable war-machine. He had, through the sheer magnetism of a strange\npersonality, carried the Eastern world with him on his march to conquest\nof the earth, and men followed him with blind faith as men in the past\nhave followed the banners of the Thaumaturgists.\n\nA strange name, to the sound of which none could assign nationality.\nSome said his father was a Russian refugee, his mother a Mongol woman.\nSome said he was the son of a Caucasian woman lost in the Gobi and\nrescued by a mad lama of Tibet, who became father of Moyen. Some said\nthat his mother was a goddess, his father a fiend out of hell.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut this all men knew about him: that he combined within himself the\ncourage of a Hannibal, the military genius of a Napoleon, the ideals of\na Sun Yat Sen; and that he had sworn to himself he would never rest\nuntil the earth was peopled by a single nation, with Moyen himself in\nthe seat of the mighty ruler.\n\nMadagascar was the seat of his government, from which he looked across\ninto United Africa, the first to join his confederacy. The Orient was a\ndependency, even to that forbidden land of the Goloks, where outlanders\nsometimes went, but whence they never returned--and to the wild Goloks\nhe was a god whose will was absolute, to render obedience to whom was a\nprivilege accorded only to the Chosen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a short year his confederacy had brought under his might the millions\nof Asia, which he had welded into a mighty machine for further conquest.\n\nAnd because the Americas saw the handwriting on the wall, they sent out\nto see the man Moyen, with orders to penetrate to his very side, as a\nspy, their most trusted Secret Agent--Prester Kleig.\n\nOnly the ignorant believed that Moyen was mad. The military and\ndiplomatic geniuses of the world recognized his genius, and resented it.\n\nBut Prester Kleig, of the Secret Service of the Americas, one of the\n_few_ men whose headquarters were in the Secret Room in Washington, had\nreached Moyen.\n\nNow he was coming home.\n\nHe came home to tell his people what Moyen was planning, and to admit\nthat his investigations had been hampered at every turn by the uncanny\ngenius of Moyen. Military plans had been guarded with unbelievable\nsecrecy. War machines he knew to exist, yet had seen only those common\nto all the armies of the world.\n\nAnd now, twenty-four hours out of New York City, aboard the _S. S.\nStellar_, Prester Kleig was literally willing the steamer to greater\nspeed--and in far Madagascar the strange man called Moyen had given the\nultimatum:\n\n\"The Western World shall be next!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_The Hand of Moyen._\n\n\n\"Who is that man?\" asked a young lady passenger of the steward, with the\nimperious inflection which tells of riches able to force obedience from\nmenials who labor for hire.\n\nShe pointed a bejeweled finger at the slender, soldierly figure which\nstood in the prow of the liner, like a figurehead, peering into the\nstorm under the vessel's forefoot.\n\n\"That gentleman, milady?\" repeated the steward obsequiously. \"That is\nPrester Kleig, head of the Secret Agents, Master of the Secret Room,\njust now returning from Madagascar, via Europe, after a visit to the\nrealm of Moyen.\"\n\nA gasp of terror burst from the lips of the woman. Her cheeks blanched.\n\n\"Moyen!\" She almost whispered it. \"Moyen! The half-god of Asia, whom men\ncall mad!\"\n\n\"Not mad, milady. No, Moyen is not mad, save with a lust for power. He\nis the conqueror of the ages, already ruling more of the earth's\npopulation than any man has ever done before him--even Alexander!\"\n\nBut the young lady was not listening to stewards. Wealthy young ladies\ndid not, save when asked questions dealing with personal service to\nthemselves. Her eyes devoured the slender man who stood in the prow of\nthe _Stellar_, while her lips shaped, over and over again, the dread\nname which was on the lips of the people of the world:\n\n\"Moyen! Moyen!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp in the prow, if Prester Kleig, who carried a dread secret in his\nbreast, knew of the young lady's regard, he gave no sign. There were\ntouches of gray at his temples, though he was still under forty. He had\nseen more of life, knew more of its terrors, than most men twice his\nage--because he had lived harshly in service to his country.\n\nHe was thinking of Moyen, the genius of the misshapen body, the pale\neyes which reflected the fires of a Satanic soul, set deeply in the\nmidst of the face of an angel; and wondering if he would be able to\narrive in time, sorry that he had not returned home by airplane.\n\nHe had taken the _Stellar_ only because the peacefulness of ocean liner\ntravel would aid his thoughts, and he required time to marshal them.\nLiner travel was now a luxury, as all save the immensely wealthy\ntraveled by plane across the oceans. Now Prester Kleig was sorry, for\nany moment, he felt, Moyen might strike.\n\nHe turned and looked back along the deck of the _Stellar_. His eyes\nplayed over the trimly gowned figure of the woman who questioned the\nsteward, but did not really see her. And then....\n\n\"Great God!\" The words were a prayer, and they burst from the lips of\nPrester Kleig like an explosion. Passengers appeared from the lee of\nlifeboats. Officers on the bridge whirled to look at the man who\nshouted. Seamen paused in their labors to stare. Aloft in the\ncrow's-nest the lookout lowered his eyes from scouring the horizon to\nstare at Prester Kleig--who was pointing.\n\nAll eyes turned in the direction indicated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClimbing into the sky, a mile off the starboard beam, was an airplane\nwith a bulbous body and queerly slanted wings. It had neither wheels nor\npontoons, and it traveled with unbelievable speed. It came on\nbullet-fast, headed directly for the side of the _Stellar_.\n\n\"Lower the boats!\" yelled Kleig. \"Lower the boats! For God's sake lower\nthe boats!\"\n\nFor Prester Kleig, in that casual turning, had seen what none aboard the\n_Stellar_, even the lookout above, had seen. The airplane, which had\nneither wheels nor pontoons, had risen, as Aphrodite is said to have\nrisen, out of the waves! He had seen the wings come out of the bulbous\nbody, snap backward into place, and the plane was in full flight the\ninstant it appeared.\n\nPrester Kleig had no hope that his warning would be in time, but he\nwould always feel better for having given it. As the captain debated\nwith himself as to whether this lunatic should be confined as dangerous,\nthe strange airplane nosed over and dived down to the sea, a hundred\nyards from the side of the _Stellar_. Just before it struck the water,\nits wings snapped forward and became part of the bulbous body of the\nthing, the whole of which shot like a bullet into the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrester Kleig stood at the rail, peering out at the spot where the plane\nhad plunged in with scarcely a splash, and his right hand was raised as\nthough he gave a final, despairing signal.\n\nOf all aboard the _Stellar_, he only saw that black streak which, ten\nfeet under water, raced like a bolt of lightning from the nose of the\nsubmerged but visible plane, straight as a die for the side of the\n_Stellar_. Just a black streak, no bigger than a small man's arm, from\nthe nose of the plane to the side of the _Stellar_.\n\nFrom the crow's-nest came the startled, terrific voice of the lookout,\nin the beginning of a cry that must remain forever inarticulate.\n\nThe world, in that blinding moment, seemed to rock on its foundations;\nto shatter itself to bits in a chaotic jumble of sound and of movement,\nshot through and through with lurid flames. Kleig felt himself hurled\nupward and outward, turned over and over endlessly....\n\nHe felt the storm-tossed waters close over him, and knew he had struck.\nIn the moment he knew--oblivion, deep, ebon and impenetrable, blotted\nout knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Half-Dream_\n\n\nA roaring, rushing river of chaotic sound, first. Jumbled sound to which\nPrester Kleig could give no adequate name. But as he tried to analyze\nits meanings, he was able to differentiate between sounds, and to\ndiscover the identity of some.\n\nThe river of sound he decided to be the sound of a vibrational explosion\nof some sort--vibrational because it had that quivery quality which\ncauses a feeling of uneasiness and fret, that feeling which makes one\nturn and look around to find the eyes boring into one's back--yet\nmultiplied in its intensity an uncounted number of times.\n\nOther sounds which came through the chaotic river of sound were the\nterrified screaming of the men and women who were doomed. Lifeboats were\nnever lowered, for the reason that with the disintegration of the\n_Stellar_, everything inanimate aboard her likewise disintegrated,\ndropping men and women, crew and passengers, into the freezing waters of\nthe Atlantic.\n\nPrester Kleig dropped with them, only partially unconscious after the\nfirst icy plunge. He knew when he floated on the surface, for he felt\nhimself lifted and hurled by the waves. In his half-dream he saw men and\nwomen being carried away into wave-shrouded darkness, clawing wildly at\nnothingness for support, clawing at one another, locking arms, and going\ndown together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Stellar_, in the merest matter of seconds, had become spoil of the\nsea, and her crew and passengers had vanished forever from the sight of\nmen. Yet Prester Kleig lived on, knew that he lived on, and that there\nwas an element, too strong to be disbelieved, of reality in his dream.\n\nThere was a vibratory sense, too, as of the near activity of a noiseless\nmotor. Noiseless motor! Where had he last thought of those two words?\nWith what recent catastrophe were they associated? No, he could not\nrecall, though he knew he should be able to do so.\n\nThen the sense of motion to the front was apparent--an unnumbered sense,\nrather than concrete feeling. Motion to front, influenced by the rising\nand falling motion of mountainous waves.\n\nSo suddenly as to be a distinct shock, the wave motion ceased, though\nthe forward motion--and _upward!_--not only continued but increased.\n\nThat airplane of the bulbous body, the queerly slanted wings....\n\nBut the glimmering of realization vanished as a sickishly sweet odor\nassailed his nostrils and sent its swift-moving tentacles upward to wrap\nthemself soothingly about his brain. But the sense of flight,\nunbelievably swift, was present and recognizable, though all else eluded\nhim. He had the impression, however, that it was intended that all save\nthe most vagrant, most widely differentiated, impressions elude\nhim--that he should acquire only half pictures, which would therefore be\nall the more terrible in retrospect.\n\nThe only impressions which were real were those of motion to the front,\nand upward, and the sense of noiseless machinery, vibrating the whole,\nnearby.\n\nThen a distinct realization of the cessation of the sense of flying, and\na return, though in lesser degree, of the rising and falling of waves.\nThis latter sensation became less and less, though the feeling of\ntraveling downward continued. Prester Kleig knew that he was going down\ninto the sea again, down into it deeply.... Then that odor once more,\nand the elusive memory.\n\nForward motion at last, in the depths, swift, forward motion, though\nPrester Kleig could not even guess at the direction. Just swift motion,\nand the mutter of voices, the giving of orders....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrester Kleig regained consciousness fully on the sands of the shore. He\nsat up stiffly, staring out to sea. A storm was raging, and the sea was\nan angry waste. No ship showed on the waters; the mad, tumbled sky above\nit was either empty of planes or they had climbed to invisibility above\nthe clouds that raced and churned with the storm.\n\nOut of the storm, almost at Prester Kleig's feet, dropped a small\nairplane. Through the window a familiar face peered at Kleig. A\nhelmeted, begoggled figure opened the door and stepped out.\n\n\"Kleig, old man,\" said the flyer, \"you gave me the right dope all right,\nbut I'll swear there isn't a wireless tower within a hundred miles of\nthis place! How did you manage it?\"\n\n\"Kane, you're crazy, or I am, or....\" But Prester Kleig could not go on\nwith the thought which had rushed through his brain with the numbing\nimpact of a blow. He grasped the hand of Carlos Kane, of the Domestic\nService, and the yellow flimsy Kane held out to him. It read simply:\n\n\"Shipwrecked. Am ashore at--\" There followed grid coordinate map\nreadings. \"Come at once, prepared to fly me to Washington.\" It was\nsigned \"Kleig.\"\n\n\"Kane,\" said Kleig, \"I did not send this message!\"\n\nWhat more was there to be said? Horror looked out of the eyes of Prester\nKleig, and was reflected in those of Carlos Kane. Both men turned,\npeering out across the tumbled welter of waters.\n\nSomewhere out there, tight-locked in the gloomy archives of the\nAtlantic, was the secret of the message which had brought Carlos Kane to\nPrester Kleig--and the agency which had sent it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Wings of To-morrow_\n\n\nAs Prester Kleig climbed into the enclosed passenger pit of the\nmonoplane--a Mayther--his ears seemed literally to be ringing with the\ndrumming, mighty voice of Moyen. But now that voice, instead of merely\nspeaking, rang with sardonic laughter. He had never heard the laughter\nof Moyen, but he could guess how it would sound.\n\nThat airplane of the slanted wings, the bulbous, almost bulletlike\nfuselage, what of it? It was simple, as Kleig looked back at his\nmemoried glimpse of it. The submarine was a metal fish made with human\nhands; the airplane aped the birds. The strange ship which had caused\nthe destruction of the _Stellar_, was a combination fish and bird--which\nmerely aped nature a bit further, as anyone who had ever traversed\ntropical waters would have instantly recognized.\n\nBut what did it portend? What ghastly terrors of Moyen roamed the deeps\nof the Atlantic, of the Pacific, the oceans of the world? How close\nwere some of these to the United States?\n\nThe pale eyes of Moyen, he was sure, were already turned toward the\nWest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrester Kleig sighed as he seated himself beside Carlos Kane. Then Kane\npressed one of the myriad of buttons on the dash, and Kleig lifted his\neyes to peer through the skylight, to where that single press of a\nbutton had set in motion the intricate machinery of the helicopter.\n\nA four-bladed fan lifted on a slender pedestal, sufficiently high above\nthe surface of the wing for the vanes to be free of the central\npropeller. Then, automatically, the vanes became invisible, and the\nMayther lifted from the sandy beach as lightly, and far more straightly,\nthan any bird.\n\nAs the ship climbed away for the skies, and through the transparent\nfloor the beach and the Atlantic fell away below the ship, a sigh of\nrelief escaped Kleig. This was living! Up here one was free, if only for\na moment, and the swift wind of flight brushed all cobwebs from the\ntired human brain. He watched the slender needle of the altimeter, as it\nmoved around the face of the dial as steadily as the hands of a clock,\naround to thirty thousand, thirty-five, forty.\n\nThen Carlos Kane, every movement as effortless as the flight of the\nsilvery winged Mayther, thrust forth his hand to the dash again, pressed\nanother button. Instantly the propellers vanished into a blur as the\nvanes of the helicopter dropped down the slender staff and the vanes\nthemselves fitted snugly into their appointed notches atop the wing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a second Carlos Kane glanced at the tiny map to the right of the\ndash, and set his course. It was a matter of moments only, but while\nKane worked, Prester Kleig studied the instruments on the dash, for it\nhad been months since he had flown, save for his recent half-dreamlike\nexperience. There was a button which released the mechanism of the\ndeadly guns, fired by compressed air, all operated from the noiseless\nmotor, whose muzzles exactly cleared the tips of Mayther's wings, two\nguns to each wing, one on the entering edge, one on the trailing edge,\nfitted snugly into the adamant rigging.\n\nFour guns which could fire to right or left, twin streams of lead, the\nnumber of rounds governed only by the carrying power of the Mayther.\nPrester Kleig knew them all: the guns in the wings, the guns which fired\nthrough the three propellers, and the guns set two and two in the\nfuselage, to right and left of the pits, which could be fixed either up\nor down--all by the mere pressing of buttons. It was marvelous,\nmiraculous, yet even as Kleig told himself that this was so, he felt,\ndeep in the heart of him, that Moyen knew all about ships like these,\nand regarded them as the toys of children.\n\nKane touched Kleig on the shoulder, signaling, indicating that the\natmosphere in the pits had been regulated to their new height, and that\nthey could remove their helmets and oxygen tanks without danger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a sigh Prester Kleig sat back, and the two friends turned to face\neach other.\n\n\"You certainly look done in, Kleig,\" said Kane sympathetically. \"You\nmust have been through hell, and then some. Tell me about this Moyen;\nthat is, if you think you care to talk about him.\"\n\n\"Talk about him!\" repeated Kleig. \"Talk about him? It will be a relief!\nThere has been nothing, and nobody, on my mind save Moyen for weary\nmonths on end. If I don't talk to someone about him, I'll go mad, if I'm\nnot mad already. Moyen? A monster with the face of an angel! What else\ncan one say about him? A devil and a saint, a brute whose followers\nwould go with him into hell's fire, and sing him hosannas as they were\nconsumed in agony! The greatest mob psychologist the world has ever\nseen. He's a genius, Kane, and unless something is done, the Western\nworld, all the world, is doomed to sit at the feet, listen to the\ncommands, of Moyen!\n\n\"He isn't an Oriental; he isn't a European; he isn't negroid or Indian;\nbut there is something about him that makes one thing of all of these,\nsingly and collectively. His body is twisted and grotesque, and when one\nlooks at his face, one feels a desire to touch him, to swear eternal\nfealty to him--until one looks into his pale eyes, eyes almost milky in\ntheir paleness--and gets the merest hint of the thoughts which actuate\nhim. If he has a failing I did not find it. He does not drink,\ngamble....\"\n\n\"And women?\" queried Kane, softly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKleig was madly in love with the sister of Kane, Charmion, and this\nthing touched him nearest the heart, because Charmion was one of her\ncountry's most famous beauties, about whom Moyen must already have\nheard.\n\n\"Women?\" repeated Kleig musingly, his black eyes troubled, haunted. \"I\nscarcely know. He has no love for women, only because he has no capacity\nfor any love save self-love. But when I think of him in this connection\nI seem to see Moyen, grown to monster proportions, sitting on a mighty\nthrone, with nude women groveling at his feet, bathed in tears, their\nlong hair in mantles of sorrow, hiding their shamed faces! That sounds\nwild, doesn't it? But it's the picture I get of Moyen when I think of\nMoyen and of women. Many women will love him, and have, perhaps. But\nwhile he has taken many, though I am only guessing here, he has given\n_himself_ to none. Another thing: His followers--well, he sets no limits\nto the lusts of his men, requiring only that every soldier be fit for\nduty, with a body strong for hardship. You understand?\"\n\nKane understood; and his face was very pale.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, his voice almost a whisper, \"I understand, and as you\nspeak of this man I seem to see a city in ruins, and hordes of men\nmarching, bloodstained men entering houses ... from which, immediately\nafterward, come the screams of women ... terror-stricken women....\"\n\nHe shuddered and could not go on for the very horror of the vision that\nhad come to him.\n\nBut Kleig stared at him as though he saw a ghost.\n\n\"Great God, Carl!\" he gasped. \"The same identical picture has been in my\nmind, not once but a thousand times! I wonder....\"\n\nWas it an omen of the future for the West?\n\nDeep in his soul Prester Kleig fancied he could hear the sardonic\nlaughter of the half-god, Moyen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA tiny bell rang inside the dash, behind the instruments. Kane had set\ndirection finders, had pressed the button which signaled the\nWashington-control Station of the National Radio, thus automatically\nindicating the exact spot above land, by grid-coordinates, where the\nMayther should start down for the landing.\n\nAn hour later they landed on the flat roof of the new Capitol Building,\nsinking lightly to rest as a feather, nursed to a gentle landing by the\nwhirring vanes of the helicopter.\n\nPrester Kleig, surrounded by uniformed guards who tried to shield him\nfrom the gaze of news-gatherers crowded there on the roof-top, hurried\nhim to the stairway leading into the executive chambers, and through\nthese to the Secret Chamber which only a few men knew, and into which\nnot even Carlos Kane could follow Prester Kleig--yet.\n\nBut one man, one news-gatherer, had caught a glimpse of the face of\nKleig, and already he raced for the radio tower of his organization, to\nblazon to the Western world the fact that Kleig had come back.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_A Nation Waits in Dread_\n\n\nAs Prester Kleig, looking twice his forty years because of fatigue, and\nalmost nameless terrors through which he had passed, went to his\nrendezvous, the news-gatherer, who shall here remain nameless, raced for\nthe Broadcasting Tower.\n\nAs Prester Kleig entered the Secret Room and at a signal all the many\ndoors behind him, along that interminable stairway, swung shut and were\ntightly locked, the news-gatherer raced for the microphone and gave the\n\"priority\" signal to the operator. Millions of people would not only\nhear the words of the news-gatherer, but would see him, note the\nexpressions which chased one another across his face. For television was\nlong since an accomplished, everyday fact.\n\n\"Prester Kleig, of this government's Secret Service, has just returned\nto the United Americas! Your informer has just seen him step from the\nmonoplane of Carlos Kane, atop the Capitol Building, and repair at once\nto the Secret Room, closely guarded. But I saw his face, and though he\nis under forty, he seems twice that. And you know now what this country\nhas only guessed at before--that he has seen Moyen. Moyen the half-man,\nhalf-god, the enigma of the ages. What does Prester Kleig think of this\nman? He doesn't say, for he dares not speak, yet. But your informer saw\nhis face, and it is old and twisted with terror! And--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat ended the discourse of the news-gatherer, and it was many hours\nbefore the public really understood. For, with a new sentence but half\ncompleted, the picture of the news-gatherer faded blackly off the\nscreens in a million homes, and his voice was blotted out by a humming\nthat mounted to a terrific appalling shriek! Some terrible agency, about\nwhich people who knew their radio could only guess, had drowned out the\nwords of the news-gatherer, leaving the public stunned and bewildered,\nalmost groping before a feeling of terror which was all the more\nunbearable because none could give it a name.\n\nAnd the public had heard but a fraction of the truth--merely that Kleig\nhad come back. It had been the intention of the government to deny the\npublic even this knowledge, and it had; but knowledge of the denial\nitself was public property, which filled the hearts of men and women all\nthrough the Western Hemisphere with nameless dread. And over all this\nabode of countless millions hovered the shadow of Moyen.\n\nThe government tried to correct the impression which the news-gatherer\nhad given out.\n\n\"Prester Kleig is back,\" said the radio, while the government speaker\ntried, for the benefit of those who could see him, to smile\nreassuringly. \"But there is nothing to cause anyone the slightest\nconcern. He has seen Moyen, yes, and has heard him speak, but still\nthere is nothing to distress anyone, and the whole story will be given\nto you as soon as possible. Kleig has gone into the Secret Room, yes,\nbut every operative of the government, when discussing business\nconnected with diplomatic relations with foreign powers, is received in\nthe Secret Room. No cause for worry!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was so easy to say that, and the speaker realized it, which was why\nhe could but with difficulty make his smile seem reassuring.\n\n\"Tell us the truth, and tell us quickly,\" might have been the voiceless\ncries of those who listened and saw the face and fidgeting form of the\nspeaker. But the words were not spoken, because the people sensed a\nhovering horror, a dread catastrophe beyond the power of words to\nexpress--and so looked at one another in silence, their eyes wide with\ndread, their hearts throbbing to suffocation with nameless foreboding.\n\nSo eyes were horror-haunted, and men walked, flew, and rode in fear and\ntrembling--while, down in the Secret Room, Prester Kleig and a dozen old\nmen, men wise in the ways of science and invention, wise in the ways of\nmen and of beasts, of Nature and the Infinite Outside, decided the fate\nof the Nation.\n\nThat Secret Room was closed to every one. Not even the news-gatherers\ncould reach it; not even the all-seeing eye of the telephotograph\nemblazoned to the world its secrets.\n\nBut _was_ it secret?\n\nPerhaps Moyen, the master mobster, smiled when he heard men say so, men\nwho knew in their hearts that Moyen regarded other earthlings as\nearthlings regard children and their toys. Did the eyes of Moyen gaze\neven into the depths of the Secret Room, hundreds of feet below even the\ndocumentary-treasure vaults of the Capitol?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo one knew the answer to the question, but the radio, reporting the\nreturn of Kleig, had given the public a distorted vision of an embodied\nfear, and in its heart the public answered \"Yes!\" And what had drowned\nout the voice of the radio-reporter?\n\nNo wonder that, for many hours, a nation waited in fear and trembling,\neyes filled with dread that was nameless and absolute, for word from the\nSecret Room. Fear mounted and mounted as the hours passed and no word\ncame.\n\nIn that room Prester Kleig and the twelve old men, one of whom was the\ncountry's President, held counsel with the man who had come back. But\nbefore the spoken counsel had been held, awesome and awe-inspiring\npictures had flashed across the screen, invented by a third of the old\nmen, from which the world held no secrets, even the secrets of Moyen.\n\nWith this mechanism, guarded at forfeit of the lives of a score of men,\nthe men of the Secret Room could peer into even the most secret places\nof the world. The old men had peered, and had seen things which had\nblanched their pale cheeks anew. And when they had finished, and the\nterrible pictures had faded out, a voice had spoken suddenly, like an\nexplosion, in the Secret Room.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, are you satisfied that resistance is futile?\"\n\nJust the voice; but to one man in the Secret Room, and to the others\nwhen his numbing lips spoke the name, it was far more than enough. For\nnot even the wisest of the great men could explain how, as they knew,\nhaving just seen him there, a man could be in Madagascar while his voice\nspoke aloud in the Secret Room, where even radio was barred!\n\nThe name on the lips of Prester Kleig!\n\n\"Moyen! Moyen!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Monsters of the Deep_\n\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Prester Kleig as he entered the Secret Room, where sat\nthe scientists and inventive geniuses of the Americas, \"we haven't much\ntime, and I shall waste but little of it. Moyen is ready to strike, if\nhe hasn't already done so, as I believe. We will see in a matter of\nseconds. Professor Maniel, we shall need, first of all, your apparatus\nfor returning the vibratory images of events which have transpired\nwithin the last thirty-six hours.\n\n\"I wish to show those of you who failed to see it the sinking of the\n_Stellar_, on which I was a passenger and, I believe, the only\nsurvivor.\"\n\nProfessor Maniel strangely mouse-like save for the ponderous dome of his\nforehead, stepped away from the circular table without a word. He had\ninvented the machine in question, and he was inordinately proud of it.\nThrough its use he could pick up the sounds, and the pictures, of events\nwhich had transpired down the past centuries, from the tinkling of the\ncymbals of Miriam to all the horror of the conflict men had called the\nGreat War, simply by drawing back from the ether, as the sounds fled\noutward through space, those sounds and vibrations which he needed.\n\nHis science was an exact one, more carefully exact even than the\nmeasurement of the speed of light, taking into consideration the\ndispersion of sound and movement, and the element of time.\n\nThe interior of the Secret Room became dark as Maniel labored with his\nminute machinery. Only behind the screen on the wall in rear of the\ntable was there light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe voice of Maniel began to drone as he thought aloud.\n\n\"There is a matter of but a few minutes difference in time between\nWashington and the last recorded location of the _Stellar_. The sinking\noccurred at ten-thirty last evening you say, Kleig? Ah, yes, I have it!\nWatch carefully, gentlemen!\"\n\nSo silent were the Secret Agents one could not even have heard the\nbreathing of one of them, for on the screen, misty at first, but\nbecoming moment by moment bolder of outline, was the face of a\nstorm-tossed sea. The liner was slower in forming, and was slightly out\nof focus for a second or two.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Professor Maniel. \"There it is!\"\n\nThrough the sound apparatus came the roaring and moaning of a storm at\nsea. On the screen the _Stellar_ rose high on the waves, dropped into\nthe trough, while spumes of black smoke spread rearward on the waters\nfrom her spouting funnels. Figures were visible on her decks, figures\nwhich seemed carved in bronze.\n\nIn the prow, every expression on his face plainly visible, stood Prester\nKleig himself, and as his picture appeared he was in the act of turning.\n\n\"Now,\" said Kleig himself, there in the Secret Room, \"look off to the\nleft, gentlemen, a mile from the _Stellar_!\"\n\nA rustling sound as the scientists shifted in their places.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey all saw it, and a gasp burst from their lips as though at a signal.\nFor, as the _Stellar_ seemed about to plunge off the shadowed screen\ninto the Secret Room, a flying thing had risen out of the sea--an\nairplane with a bulbous body and queerly slanting wings.\n\nAt the same time, out of the mouth of the pictured figure of Prester\nKleig, clear and agonized as the tones of a bell struck in frenzy, the\nwords:\n\n\"Great God! Lower the boats! Lower the boats! For God's sake lower the\nboats!\"\n\nIn the Secret Room the real Prester Kleig spoke again.\n\n\"When the black streak leaves the nose of the plane, after it has\nsubmerged, Professor Maniel,\" said Kleig softly, \"slow your mechanism so\nthat we can see the whole thing in detail.\"\n\nThere came a grunted affirmative from Professor Maniel.\n\nThe nose of the pictured plane tilted over, diving down for the surface\nof the sea.\n\n\"Now!\" snapped Kleig. \"Don't wait!\"\n\nInstantly the moving pictures on the screen reduced their speed, and the\nplane appeared to stop its sudden seaward plunge and to drop down as\nlightly as a feather. The wings of the thing moved forward slowly,\nfolding into the body of the dropping plane.\n\n\"They fold forward,\" said Kleig quietly, \"so that the speed of the plane\nin the take-off will snap them _backward_ into position for flying!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo one spoke, because the explanation was so obvious.\n\nSlowly the airplane went down to the surface of the sea, with scarcely a\nplume of spindrift leaping back after she had struck. She dropped to ten\nfeet below the surface of the water, a hundred yards off the starboard\nbeam of the _Stellar_, her blunt nose pointing squarely at the side of\nthe doomed liner.\n\n\"Now,\" said Kleig hoarsely, \"watch closely, for God's sake!\"\n\nThe liner rose and fell slowly. Out of the nose of the plane, which had\nnow become a tiny submarine, started a narrow tube of black, oddly like\nthe sepia of a giant squid. Straight toward the side of the liner it\nwent. Above the rail the Secret Agents could see the pictured form of\nPrester Kleig, hand upraised. The black streak reached the side of the\n_Stellar_.\n\nIt touched the metal plates, spreading upon impact, growing, enlarging,\nto right and left, upward and downward, and where it touched the\n_Stellar_ the black of it seemed to erase that portion of the ship. In\nthe slow motion every detail was apparent. At regular speed the blotting\nout of the _Stellar_ would have been instantaneous.\n\nKleig saw himself rise slowly from the vanished rail, turning over and\nover, going down to the sea. He almost closed his eyes, bit his lips to\nkeep back the cries of terror when he saw the others aboard the liner\nrise, turn over and over, and fly in all directions like jackstraws in a\nhigh wind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship was erased from beneath passengers and crew, and passengers and\ncrew fell into the sea. Out of the depths, from all directions, came the\nstarving denizens of the sea--starving because liners now were so few.\n\n\"That's enough of that, Professor,\" snapped Kleig. \"Now jump ahead\napproximately eight hours, and see if you can pick up that aero-sub\nafter it dropped me on the Jersey Coast.\"\n\nThe picture faded out quickly, the screaming of doomed human beings,\nalready hours dead, called back to apparent living by the genius of\nManiel died away, and for a space the screen was blank.\n\nThen, the sea again, storm-tossed as before, shifting here and there as\nManiel sought in the immensity of sea and sky for the thing he desired.\n\n\"Two hundred miles south by east of New York City,\" he droned. \"There it\nis, gentlemen!\"\n\nThey all saw it then, in full flight, eight thousand feet above the\nsurface of the Atlantic, traveling south by east at a dizzy rate of\nspeed.\n\n\"Note,\" said Kleig, \"that it keeps safely to the low altitudes, in order\nto escape the notice of regular air traffic.\"\n\nNo one answered.\n\nThe eyes of the Secret Agents were on that flashing, bulbous-bodied\nplane of the strange wings. It appeared to be heading directly for some\nobjective which must be reached at top speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor fifteen minutes the flight continued. Then the plane tilted over and\ndived, and at an altitude still of three thousand feet, the wings\nslashed forward, clicking into their notches in the sides of the bulbous\nbody, with a sound like the ratchets on subway turnstiles, and, holding\ntheir breath, the Secret Agents watched it plummet down to the sea. It\nwas traveling with terrific speed when it struck, yet it entered the\nwater with scarcely a splash.\n\nThen, for the first time, an audible gasp, as that of one person, came\nfrom the lips of the Secret Agents. For now they could see the objective\nof the aero-sub. A monster shadow in the water, at a depth of five\nhundred feet. A shadow which, as Maniel manipulated his instruments,\nbecame a floating underwater fortress, ten times the size of any\nsubmarine known to the Americas.\n\nSporting like porpoises about this held-in-suspension fortress were\nmyriads of other aero-subs, maneuvering by squadrons and flights,\nweaving in and out like schools of fish. The plane which had bourne\nPrester Kleig churned in between two of the formations, and vanished\ninto the side of the motionless monster of the deep.\n\nThe striking of a deep sea bell, muted by tons and tons of water,\nsounded in the Secret Room.\n\n\"Don't turn it off, Maniel,\" said Kleig. \"There's more yet!\"\n\nAnd there was, for the sound of the bell was a signal. The aero-subs,\ndarting outward from the side of the floating fortress like fish darting\nout of seaweed, were plunging up toward the surface of the Atlantic.\nBreathlessly the Secret Agents watched them.\n\nThey broke water like flying fish, and their wings shot backward from\ntheir notches in the myriad bulbous bodies to click into place in flying\nposition as the scores of aero-subs took the air above the invisible\nhiding places of the mother submarine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt eight thousand feet the aero-subs swung into battle formation and, as\nthough controlled by word of command, they maneuvered there like one\nvast machine of a central control--beautiful as the flight of swallows,\ndeadly as anything that flew.\n\nThe Secret Agents swept the cold sweat from their brows, and sighs of\nterror escaped them all.\n\nAt that moment came the voice, loud in the Secret Room, which Kleig at\nleast immediately recognized:\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, are you satisfied that resistance is futile?\"\n\nAnd Kleig whispered the name, over and over again.\n\n\"Moyen! Moyen!\"\n\nIt was Prester Kleig, Master of the Secret Room, who was the first to\nregain control after the nerve-numbing question which, asked in far\nMadagascar, was heard by the Agents in the Secret Room.\n\n\"No!\" he shouted. \"No! No! Moyen, in the end we will beat you!\"\n\nOnly silence answered, but deep in the heart of Prester Kleig sounded a\nburst of sardonic laughter--the laughter of Moyen, half-god of Asia.\nThen the voice again:\n\n\"The attack is beginning, gentlemen! Within an hour you will have\nfurther evidence of the might of Moyen!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Vanishing Ships_\n\n\nPrester Kleig, ordered to Madagascar from the Secret Room, had been\nmerely an operative, honored above others in that he had been one of\nthe few, at that time, ever to visit the Secret Room. Now, however,\nbecause he had walked closer to Moyen than anyone else, he assumed\nleadership almost by natural right, and the men who had once deferred to\nhim took orders from him.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he snapped, while the last words of Moyen still hung in the\nair of the Secret Room, \"we must fight Moyen from here. The best brains\nin the United Americas are gathered here, and if Moyen can be\nbeaten--_if_ he can be beaten--he will be beaten from the Secret Room!\"\n\nA sigh from the lips of Professor Maniel. The President of the United\nAmericas nodded his head, as though he too mutely gave authority into\nthe hands of Prester Kleig. The other Secret Agents shifted slightly,\nbut said nothing.\n\n\"I have been away a year,\" said Kleig, \"as you know, and many things\nhave come into regular use since I left. Professor Maniel's machine for\nexample, upon which he was working when I departed under orders. There\nwill be further use for it in our struggle with Moyen. Professor, will\nyou kindly range the ocean, beginning at once, and see how many of these\nmonsters of Moyen we have to contend with?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Maniel turned back to his instruments, which he fondled with\ngentle, loving hands.\n\n\"We have nothing with which to combat the attacking forces of Moyen,\"\nwent on Kleig, \"save antiquated airplanes, and such obsolete warships as\nare available. These will be mere fodder for the guns, or rays, or\nwhatever it is that Moyen uses in his aero-subs. Thousands, perhaps\nmillions, of human lives will be lost; but better this than that Moyen\nrule the West! Better this than that our women be given into the hands\nof this mob as spoils of war!\"\n\nFrom the Secret Agents a murmur of assent.\n\nAnd then, that voice again, startling, clear, with the slightest\nsuggestion of some Oriental accent, in the Secret Room.\n\n\"Do not depend too much, gentlemen,\" it said, \"upon your antiquated\nwarships! See, I am merciful, in that I do not allow you to send them\nagainst me loaded with men to be slaughtered or drowned! Professor\nManiel, I would ask you to turn that plaything of yours and gaze upon\nthe fleet of obsolete ships anchored in Hampton Roads! In passing,\nProfessor, I venture to guess that the secret of how I am able to talk\nwith you gentlemen, here in your Secret Room, is no secret at all to\nyou. Now look!\"\n\nThe Secret Agents gasped again, in consternation.\n\nFrom the white lips of mouselike Maniel came mumbled words, even as his\nhands worked with lightning speed.\n\n\"His machine is simply a variation of my own. And, gentlemen,\ncompatriots, with it he could as easily project himself, bodily, here\ninto the room with us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething like a suppressed scream from one of the men present. A cold\nhand of ice about the heart of Prester Kleig. But the words of Professor\nManiel were limned on the retina of his brain in letters of fire.\nSuppose Moyen _were_ to project himself into the Secret Room....\n\nBut he would not. He was no fool, and even these Secret Agents, most of\nwhom were old and no longer strong, would have torn him limb from limb.\nBut those words of Maniel set whirling once more, and in a new\ndirection, the thoughts of Prester Kleig.\n\n\"Mr. President, gentlemen....\" It was the voice of Professor Maniel.\n\nAll eyes turned again to the screen upon which the professor worked his\nmiracles, which today were commonplaces, which yesterday had been\nundreamed of. Every Secret Agent recognized the outlines of Hampton\nRoads, with Norfolk and its towering buildings in the background, and\nthe obsolete warships riding silently at anchor in the roadstead.\n\nFor three years they had been there, while a procrastinating Cabinet,\nCongress and Senate had debated their permanent disposal. They\nrepresented millions of dollars in money, and were utterly worthless.\nPrester Kleig, looking at them now, could see them putting out to sea,\nloaded with brave-visaged men, volunteering to go to sure destruction to\nfeed the rapacity of Moyen's hordes. Men going out to sea in tubs,\nsinging....\n\nBut these ships were silent. No plumes of smoke from their funnels. Like\nfloating mausoleums, filled with dead hopes, shells of past and departed\nglories.\n\nThe beating of waves against their sides could plainly be heard. The\nanchor chains squeaked rustily in the hawse-holes. Wind sighed through\nregal, towering superstructures, and no man walked the decks of any one\nof them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith bated breath the Secret Agents watched.\n\nWhy had Moyen bidden them turn their attention to these shells of\nerstwhile naval grandeur?\n\nThis time no gasps broke from the lips of the Secret Agents. Not even\nthe sound of breathing could be heard. Just the sighing of wind through\nthe superstructures of a hundred ships, the whispering of waves against\nrusted bulkheads.\n\nAlmost imperceptibly at first the towering dreadnought in the foreground\nbegan to move! Slowly, the water swirling about her, she backed away\nfrom her anchor, tightening the curve of the anchor chain! Water\nquivered about the point of the chain's contact with the waves!\n\nQuickly the eyes of the Secret Agents swept along the street of ships.\nThe same backward motion, of dragging against their anchor chains, was\nvisible at the bow of each warship!\n\nWith not a soul aboard them, the ships were waking into strange and\nawesome life, dragging at their anchors, like hounds pulling at leashes\nto be free and away!\n\n\"How are they doing it?\" It was almost a whisper from the President.\n\n\"Some electro-magnetic force, sir!\" stated Prester Kleig. \"Professor\nBlaine, that is your province! Please note what is happening, and advise\nus at once if you see how they are doing it!\"\n\nA grunt of affirmation from surly, obese Professor Blaine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll eyes turned back again to the miracle of the moving ships. One by\none, with crashes which echoed and re-echoed through the Secret Room,\nthe anchor chains of the dreadnoughts parted. The ends of them swung\nfrom the prows of the warships, while the severed portions splashed into\nthe Roads, and the waters hid them from view.\n\nThe great dreadnought in the foreground swung slowly about until her\nprow was pointed in the direction of the open sea, and though no sea was\nrunning, no smoke rose from her funnels, she got slowly, ponderously\nunder way, and started out the Roads. Behind her, in formation, the\nother ships swung into line.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, faster than any of these vessels had ever\ntraveled before, they were racing in column for the open Atlantic. And\nfrom the sound apparatus came wails and shrieks of terror, the\nlamentations of men and women frightened as they had never been\nfrightened before.\n\nThe shores behind the moving column of ships was moment by moment\ngrowing blacker with people--a black sea of people, whose faces were\nwhite as chalk with terror.\n\nBut on, out to sea, moved the column of brave ships.\n\nA new note entered into the picture, as from all sides airplanes of many\nmakes swooped in, and swept back and forth over the moving ships, while\nhooded heads looked out of pits, and faces of pilots were aghast at\nwhat they saw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA ghost column of ships, moving out to sea, speed increasing moment by\nmoment unbelievably. Even now, five minutes after the first dreadnought\nhad started seaward, the wake of each ship spread away on either hand in\nthe two sides of a watery triangle whose walls were a dozen feet\nhigh--racing for the shores with all the sullen majesty of tidal waves.\n\nThe crowds gave back, and their screams rose into the air in a\nfrightened roar of appalling sound.\n\nEven now, so rapidly did the warships travel, many of the planes could\nthrottle down, so that they flew directly above the heaving decks of the\nrunaway warships.\n\n\"Get word to them!\" cried Prester Kleig suddenly. \"Get word to them that\nif they follow the ships out to sea not a pilot will escape alive!\"\n\nOne of the Secret Agents rose and hurried from the Secret Room,\ntraveling at top speed for the first of the many doors enroute to the\nbroadcasting tower from which all the planes could be reached at once.\nPrester Kleig turned back to the magic screen of Maniel.\n\nThe warships, water thrown aside by the lifting thrust of their forefeet\nin mountains that raced landward with ever-increasing fury, were\nclearing the Roads and swinging south by east, heading into the wastes\nof the Atlantic. As they cleared the land, and open water for unnumbered\nmiles lay ahead, the speed of the mighty ships increased to a point\nwhere they rode as high on the water as racing launches, and the\ncreaking and groaning of their rusty bolts and spars were a continual\npaean of protest in the sound apparatus accompanying the showing of the\nmiracle on the screen.\n\n\"They're heading straight for the spot where that super-submarine lies!\"\nsaid the President, and no one answered him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrester Kleig, watching, was racing over in his mind what he could\nrecall of his country's armament. Warships were useless, as was being\nproved here before his eyes. But there still remained airplanes, in\ncountless numbers, which could be diverted from ocean travel and from\nroutine business, to battle this menace of Moyen.\n\nBut....\n\nHe shuddered as he pictured in his mind's eye the meeting of his\ncountry's flower of flying manhood with the monsters of Moyen.\n\nHis eyes, as he thought, were watching the racing of those ocean\ngreyhounds, out to sea. They were now out of sight of land, and still\nsome of the planes followed them.\n\nA half hour passed, and then....\n\nThe American pilots, in obedience to the radio signals, turning back\nfrom this strange phenomenon of the ghost column of capital ships.\n\nSimultaneously, out of the sky dead ahead, dropped the first flight of\nMoyen's aero-subs.\n\nAt the same moment the mysterious power which had dragged the ships to\nsea was withdrawn, and the warships, with no hands to guide them, swung\nwhither they willed, and floated in as many directions as there were\nships, under their forward momentum. There were a score of collisions,\nand some of the ships were in sinking condition even before the\naero-subs began their labors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe remaining ships floated high out of the water, because they carried\nno ballast, and from all sides the aero-subs of Moyen settled to the\ntask of destruction--destruction which was simply a warning of what was\nto come: Moyen's manner of proving to the Americas the fact that he was\nall-powerful.\n\n\"God, what fools!\" cried Prester Kleig.\n\nThe rearmost of the American aviators had looked back, had seen the\nfirst of the aero-subs drop down among the doomed ships. Instantly he\nturned out to sea again, signalling as he did so to the nearest other\nplanes. And in spite of the radio warning a hundred planes answered that\nsignal and swept back to investigate this new mystery.\n\n\"They're going to death!\" groaned the President.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kleig, softly, \"but it saves us ordering others to death.\nPerhaps we may learn something of value as we watch them die!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Golden Oblivion_\n\n\n\"This,\" said Prester Kleig, as coldly precise as a judge pronouncing\nsentence of death, \"will precipitate the major engagement with Moyen's\nforces. The fools, to rush in like this, when they have been warned! But\neven so, they are magnificent!\"\n\nThe pilots of the aero-subs must instantly have noticed the return of\nthe American pilots, for some of the aero-subs which had dropped to the\nocean's surface rose again almost instantly, and swept into battle\nformation above the drifting hulks of the warships.\n\nThe Americans were wary. They drew together like frightened chickens\nwhen a hawk hovers above them, and watched the activities of the\naero-subs, every move of each one being at the same time visible and\naudible to the Secret Agents in the Capitol's Secret Room.\n\nThe aero-subs which had submerged singled out their particular prey\namong the floating ships, and the Secret Agents, trying to see how each\nseparate act of destruction was accomplished, watched the aero-sub in\nthe foreground, which happened to be concentrating on the dreadnought\nwhich had led the ghost-march of the warships out to sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe aero-sub circled the swaying dreadnought as a shark circles a wreck,\nand through the walls of the aero-sub the watchers in the Secret Room\ncould see the four-man crew of the thing. Grim faced men, men of the\nOrient they plainly were, coldly concentrating on the work in hand.\nTheir faces were those of men who are merciless, even brutal, with\nneither heart nor compassion of any kind for weaker ones. One man\nmaneuvered the aero-sub, while the other three concentrated on the\napparatus in the nose of the hybrid vessel.\n\n\"See,\" spoke Prester Kleig again, \"if you can tell what manner of ray\nthey use, and how it is projected. That's your province, General\nMunson!\"\n\nFrom the particular Secret Agent named, who was expert for war in the\nmembership of the Secret Room, came a short grunt of affirmation. A few\nmurmured words.\n\n\"I'll be able to tell more about it when I see how they operate when\nthey are flying. That black streak under water ... well, I must see it\nout of the water, and then....\"\n\nBut here General Munson ended, for the aero-sub which they were\nespecially watching had got into action against the dreadnought.\n\nThe aero-sub was motionless and submerged just off the port bow of the\ndreadnought. The three men inside the aero-sub were working swiftly and\nefficiently with the complicated but minute machinery in the nose of\ntheir transport.\n\n\"It can be controlled, then, this ray,\" said Munson, interrupting\nhimself. \"Watch!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the nose of the aero-sub leaped, like a streak of black lightning,\nthat ebon agency of death. It struck the prow of the battleship--and the\nprow, as far aft as the well-deck, simply vanished from sight,\ndisintegrated! It was as though it had never been, and for a second, so\nswiftly had it happened, the water of the ocean held the impression that\nportion of the warship had made--as an explosive leaves a crater in the\nsoil of earth!\n\nThen a drumming roar as the sea rushed in to claim its own. The roaring,\nas of a Niagara, as the waters claimed the ship, rushing down\npassageways into the hold, possessing the warship with all the\ninvincible, speedy might of the sea.\n\nMingled with this roaring was the shivering, vibratory sound which\nPrester Kleig had experienced in his half-dream. The sound was so\nintense that it fairly rocked the Secret Room to its furthermost cranny.\n\nFor a second the dreadnought, wounded to death, seemed to shudder, to\nhesitate, then to move backward as though wincing from her death blow.\nIt was the pound of the inrushing waters which did it. Then up came the\nstern of the mighty ship, as she started her last long plunge into the\ndepths.\n\nBut attention had swung to another warship, on the starboard beam of\nwhich another aero-sub had taken up position. Again the ebon streak of\ndeath from her blunt nose, smashing in and through the warship, directly\namidships, cutting her in twain as though the black streak had been a\npair of shears, the warship a strip of tissue paper.\n\nUp went the prow and the stern of this one, and together, the water\nseparating the two parts as it rushed into the gap, the broken warship\nwent down to its final resting place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbruptly Professor Maniel swung back to the American planes which had\ncome back to investigate the activities of the aero-subs, and on the\nscreen, in the midst of the battle formation into which the pilots had\nswept to hurriedly, the Secret Agents could see the faces of those\npilots....\n\nWhite as chalk with fear, mouths open in gasping unbelief. One man, a\npale-faced youth, was the first to recover. He stared around at his\ncompatriots, and plainly through the sound apparatus in the Secret Room\ncame his swift radio signals.\n\n\"Attack! Who will follow me against these people?\"\n\nHis signals were very plain. So, too, were the answers of the other\npilots, and the heart of Prester Kleig swelled with pride as he listened\nto the answering signals--and counted them, discovered that every last\npilot there present elected to stay with this youngster, to avenge their\ncountry for this contemptuous insult which had been put upon her by the\nrape of Hampton Roads.\n\nInto swift formation they swept, and with these planes--all planes in\nuse were required by franchise of operating companies to be equipped for\nthe emergencies of war--swung into an echelon formation, the youthful\npilot leading by mutual consent.\n\nThey swept at full speed toward the warships, four of which had by this\ntime been sent to destruction--one of which had appeared to vanish\nutterly in the space of a single heartbeat, so quickly that for a second\nor two the shape of its bilge, the bulge of its keel, was visible in the\nface of the deep--and openly challenged the aero-subs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMuzzles of compressed air guns projected from the wing-tips of the\nplanes. Buttons were pressed which elevated the muzzles of guns arranged\nto fire upward from either side the fighting pits, twin guns that were\nfired downward from the same central magazine--the only guns in use in\nthe Americas which fired in opposite directions at the same time.\n\nBut for a few moments the aero-subs refused combat. Their speed was\nterrific, dazzling. They eluded the thrusts, the dives and plunges of\nthe American ships as easily as a swallow eludes the dive of a buzzard.\n\nIt came to Prester Kleig, however, that the aero-subs were merely\nplaying with the Americans; that when they elected to move, the planes\nwould be blasted from the sky as easily as the warships were being\nerased from the surface of the Atlantic.\n\nOne by one, as methodically as machines, the aero-sub pilots blasted the\nwarships into nothingness. They had their orders, and they went about\ntheir performance with a rigidity of discipline which astounded the\nSecret Agents. They had been ordered to destroy the warships, and they\nwere doing that first--would go on to completion of this task, no matter\nhow many American planes buzzed about their ears.\n\nBut one by one as the warships sank, the aero-subs which had either sunk\nor erased them made the surface and leaped into space with a snapping\nback of wings that was horribly businesslike as to sound, and climbed up\nto take part in the fight against the American planes, which must\ninevitably come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last warship, cut squarely in two from stem to stern along her\ncenter, as though split thus by a bolt of lightning, fell apart like\npieces of cake, and splashed down, sinking away while the spume of her\ndisintegration rolled back from her fallen sides in white-crested waves.\n\n\"It exemplifies the policies of Moyen,\" said Prester Kleig, \"for his\nconquest of the world is a conquest of destruction.\"\n\nThe last aero-sub took to the sky, and the Americans rushed into battle\nwith fine disregard for what they knew must be certain death. They were\nnot fools, exactly, and they had seen, but not understood, the manner in\nwhich those gallant old hounds of the sea had been erased from\nexistence.\n\nBut in they went, plunging squarely into the heart of the aero-subs'\nleading formation, which formation consisted of three aero-subs, flying\na wing and wing formation.\n\nThe young American signaled with upraised hand, and the American pilots\nmade their first move. Every plane started rolling, at dazzling speed,\non the axis of its fuselage, while bullets spewed from the guns that\nfired through the propellers.\n\nBullets smashed into the leading aero-subs, with no apparent effect,\nthough for a second it seemed that the central aero-sub of the leading\nformation hesitated for a moment in flight.\n\nThen, swift as had that black streak flashed from the nose of aero-subs\nsubmerged, a streak darted from the nose of the central aero-sub, and\nglistened in the sun like molten gold!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt touched the youngster who had called for volunteers for his attack\nagainst this strange enemy. It touched his plane--and the plane vanished\ninstantly, while for a fraction of a second the pilot was visible in his\nplace, in the posture of sitting, hand on a row of buttons which did not\nexist, head forward slightly as he aimed guns that had vanished.\n\nThen the pilot, still living, apparently unhurt, plunged down eight\nthousand feet to the sea. The water geysered up as he struck, then\nclosed over the spot, and the gallant American youngster had become the\nfirst victim in battle of the monsters of Moyen.\n\nVictim of a slender lancet of what seemed to be golden lightning.\n\n\"He could have killed the pilot aloft there,\" came quietly from Munson,\n\"but he chose to pull his plane away from around him! Their control of\nthe ray is miraculous!\"\n\nAs though to confirm the statement of Munson, the leading aero-sub\nstruck again, a second plane. The plane vanished, but from the spot\nwhere it had flown, not even a bit of metal or of man sufficiently large\nto be seen by the delicate recording instruments of Maniel dropped out\nof the sky.\n\nThe ray of gold was a ray of oblivion if the minions of Moyen willed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_Charmion_\n\n\n\"Prester Kleig,\" came suddenly into the Secret Room the voice of far\ndistant Moyen, \"you will at once make a change in your rules regarding\nthe admission of other than Secret Agents to the Secret Room. You will\nat once see that Charmion Kane, sister of your friend, is allowed to\nenter!\"\n\n\"God Almighty!\" A cry of agony from the lips of Prester Kleig. He had\nnot forgotten Charmion, but simply had had to move so swiftly that he\nhad put her out of his mind. For a year he had not seen her, and an hour\nor two more could not matter greatly.\n\n\"And her brother Carlos,\" went on the voice, \"see that he, too, is\nadmitted. I wish, for certain reasons, that Charmion come unharmed\nthrough the direct attack I am about to make against your country. I\nconfess that, save for this ability to speak to you, I am unable to work\nany damage to the Secret Room, which is therefore the safest place for\nCharmion Kane! Carlos Kane is being spared because he is her brother!\"\n\nThere was no mistaking the import of this sinister command from Moyen.\nHe had singled out Charmion, the best beloved of Prester Kleig, for his\nattentions, and that he was sure of the success of his attack against\nthe United Americas was proved by the calm assurance of his voice, and\nthe fact that, concentrating on the attack as he must be, he still found\ntime for a thought of Charmion Kane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hand of ice which had seldom been absent from the heart of Kleig\nsince he had first seen and heard the voice of Moyen gripped him anew.\nBlood pounded maddeningly in his temples. Cold sweat bathed his body.\n\nBut the rest of the Secret Agents, save to freeze into immobility when\nthe hated voice spoke, gave no sign. They had worries of their own, for\nno instructions had been given that they bring their own loved ones into\nthe sanctuary of the Secret Room.\n\nAs though answering the thoughts of the others, the hated voice spoke\nagain.\n\n\"I regret that I cannot arrange for sanctuary for the loved ones of all\nof you, for you are gallant antagonists; why save the few, when the many\nmust perish? For I know you will not surrender, however much I have\nproved to you that I am invincible. But Charmion Kane must be saved.\"\n\n\"God!\" whispered Kleig. \"God!\"\n\nThen spoke General Munson.\n\n\"I think this ray which the Moyenites use is a variation of the\nprinciple used in the intricate machinery of Professor Maniel, though\nhow they render it visible I do not know. But it doesn't matter, and may\nbe only a blind! You'll note that when the black streak, or the golden\nray, strikes anything that thing instantly disintegrates. A certain\npitch of resonance will break a pane of glass. It's a matter of\nvibration, solely, wherein the molecules composing any object animate or\ninanimate, are hurled in all directions instantaneously.\n\n\"Professor Maniel's apparatus, the Vibration-Retarder, is able to\nrecapture the vibrations, speeding outward endlessly through space, and\nto reconstruct, and _draw back_ to visibility the objects destroyed by\nthis visible vibratory ray, whatever it is. This problem, then, falls\ninto the province of Professor Maniel!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough the heart and soul of Prester Kleig there suddenly flowed a\ngreat surge of hope.\n\n\"General Munson, if you will operate the machinery of the\nVibration-Retarder, I wish to talk with Professor Maniel!\"\n\nInstantly, efficiently, without a word in reply to the eager command of\nPrester Kleig, General Munson relieved Professor Maniel at the apparatus\nwhich Maniel called the Vibration-Retarder, his invention which he had\ncombined with audible teleview to complete this visual miracle of the\nSecret Room. Professor Maniel stepped to where Prester Kleig was\nsitting.\n\nPrester Kleig put fingers to his lips for silence, and an expression of\nsurprise crossed the wrinkled dead-white face of the Professor.\n\nBefore Kleig could speak, however, there came a signal from somewhere\noutside the Secret Room, a signal which said that the doors were being\nopened and that a personage was coming. The Secret Agents looked at one\nanother in surprise, for every man who had a right to be inside the\nSecret Room was already present.\n\n\"I know,\" said Kleig, his face a mask of terror. \"It is Charmion and\nCarlos Kane! Moyen, the devil, has managed to make sure of obedience to\nhis orders!\"\n\nThe Secret Agents turned back to the screen, upon which the view of the\nfirst aerial brush of the American flyers with the minions of Moyen, in\ntheir aero-subs, was drawing to a terrible close.\n\nFor, as the aero-sub commanders had played with the warships, which had\nno human beings aboard them, so now did they play with the planes of the\nAmericas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne American flyer, startled into a frenzy by the fate of his fellows,\nput his helicopter into action, and leaped madly out of the midst of the\nbattle. Instantly an aero-sub zoomed, skyward after him. Again that\ngolden streak of light from the nose of an aero-sub, and the helicopter\nvanes and the slender staff upon whose tip they whirled vanished, shorn\nshort off above the vane-grooves in the top of the wing!\n\nThe plane dropped away, fluttering like a falling leaf for a moment,\nbefore the aviator started his three propellers again.\n\nA cheer broke from the lips of Prester Kleig as he watched. The\ncommander of that particular aero-sub, apparently contemptuous of this\nflyer who had tried to cut out of the fight, allowed him to fall away\nunmolested--and the American, driven berserk by the casual, contemptuous\ntreatment accorded him by this strange enemy, zoomed the second his\npropellers whirred into top-speed action, and raced up the sky toward\nthe belly of the aero-sub.\n\n\"If only the aero-sub has a blind spot!\" cried Prester Kleig.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn that instant a roaring crash sounded in the Secret Room as the\nAmerican plane, going full speed, crashed, propellers foremost, into the\nbelly of the aero-sub.\n\nAnd the aero-sub, whose brothers had seemed until this moment\ninvincible, did not escape the wrath of the American--though the\nAmerican went into oblivion with it!\n\nFor, welded together, American plane and aero-sub started the eight\nthousand feet plunge downward to the sea!\n\n\"Watch!\" shrieked Munson. \"Watch!\"\n\nAs the aero-sub and the plane plunged down through the formation of\nfighters, the aero-sub pilots saw it, and they fled in wild dismay and\nat top speed from their falling compatriot. Why? For a moment it was not\napparent. And then it was.\n\nFor out of the body of the doomed aero-subs came sheets of golden flame!\nNot the flames of fire, but the golden sheen of that streak which the\naero-subs had used against the American planes already out of the fight!\nThe American flyer had crashed into the container, whatever it was, that\nharnessed the agency through which the minions of Moyen had destroyed\nthe _Stellar_, and the battleships raped from Hampton Roads!\n\n\"It is liquid, then!\" shrieked Munson.\n\nAnd it seemed to be. For a second the golden mantle, strange,\nawe-inspiring, bathed and rendered invisible the aero-sub and the plane\nwhich had slain her. Then the golden flame vanished utterly,\ninstantly--and in the air where it had been there was nothing! The\naero-sub was gone, and the plane whose mad charge had erased her.\n\n\"Her own death dealing agency destroyed her!\" shrieked Munson. \"And the\nother aero-subs cut away from the fight to save themselves, because they\ntoo carry death and destruction within them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the inner door of the Secret Room opened and two people entered.\nOne of them, a dazzling beauty with glorious black hair and the tread of\na princess, a picture of perfection from jeweled sandals to coiffured\nhair, was Charmion Kane. Behind her came her brother, whose face was\nchalky white. But Charmion, as she crossed to Kleig and kissed him,\nwhile her eyes were luminous with love, held her head proudly high,\nimperious.\n\n\"I know,\" she said softly to Kleig, \"and I am not afraid! I know you\nwill prevent it!\"\n\nKleig waved the two to chairs and turned again to Professor Maniel.\n\nOn a piece of paper he wrote swiftly, using a mode of shorthand known\nonly to the Secret Agents.\n\n\"Professor,\" he wrote feverishly, \"can you reverse the process used in\nyour Vibration-Retarder? Tell me with your eyes, for Moyen may even know\nthis writing, and I am sure he hears what we say here, may even be able\nto see us?\"\n\nProfessor Maniel started and stared deeply into the eyes of Prester\nKleig. His face grew thoughtful. He brushed his slender hand over the\nmassive dome of his brow. Hope burned high in the heart of Prester\nKleig.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, despite Kleig's instructions to answer merely by the expression in\nhis eyes, Professor Maniel leaned forward and wrote quickly on the piece\nof paper Kleig had used.\n\n\"Two hours!\"\n\nNothing else, no explanations; but Prester Kleig knew. Maniel believed\nhe could do it, but he needed two hours in which to perfect his theory\nand make it workable. Kleig knew that had he been able to do it in two\nyears, or two decades, it still would have been in the nature of a\nmiracle.\n\nBut two hours....\n\nAnd Moyen had said that he was preparing to attack at once.\n\nIn two hours Moyen, unless the Americas fought against him with every\nresource at their command, could depopulate half the Western World.\nKleig looked back to the screen.\n\nThere was not a single American plane in the sky above the graveyard of\nthose vanished warships. And the aero-subs, swift flying as the wind,\nwere racing back to the mother ship, scores of miles away.\n\nMunson worked with the Vibration-Retarder, the Sound-and-Vision devices,\nranging the sea off the coast to either side of that huge, suspended\nfortress which was the mother submarine of the aero-subs.\n\nGasps of terror, though the sight was not unexpected, broke from the\nlips of every person in the Secret Room.\n\nFor super-monsters of Moyen were moving to the attack.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_Flowers of Martyrdom_\n\n\nFor a minute the Secret Agents were appalled by the air of might of the\ndeep-sea monsters of Moyen, brought bodily, almost into the Secret Room\nby the activities of General Munson at the Sound-and-Vision apparatus.\n\nOff the coast, miles away, yet looming moment by moment larger,\nindicating the deceptively swift speed of the monsters, were scores of\nthe great under-water fortresses, traveling toward the coast of the\nUnited Americas in a far-flung formation, each submarine separated from\nits neighbor to right and left by something like a hundred miles, easy\ncruising radius for the little aero-subs carried inside the monsters.\n\nThat each submarine did carry such spawn of Satan was plainly seen, for\nas the great submarines moved landward, scores of aero-subs sported\ngleefully about the mother ships. There was no counting the number of\nthem.\n\nTwo hours Maniel needed for his labors, which meant that for two hours\nthe flower of the country's manhood must try to hold in check the mighty\nhordes of Moyen.\n\n\"Somewhere there,\" stated Prester Kleig, \"in one or the other of those\nmonsters, is Moyen himself. I know that since he wished Charmion saved\nfor his attentions! Do your work with your apparatus, Munson, while I go\nout to the radio tower to broadcast an appeal for volunteers.\nCharmion--Carlos....\"\n\nBut Prester Kleig found that he could not continue. Not that it was\nnecessary, for Charmion and Carlos knew what was in his mind. Charmion\nwas a lady of vast intelligence, from whom life's little ironies had not\nbeen hidden--and Kane and Kleig had already discussed the activities of\nMoyen where women were concerned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrester Kleig hurried to the Central Radio Tower, and as he passed\nthrough each of the many doors leading out to the roof of the new\nCapitol Building the guards at the doors left to form a guard for him,\nat this moment the most precious man in the country, because he knew\nbest the terrible trials which faced her.\n\nThe country was in turmoil. It seemed almost impossible that a whole day\nhad passed since Prester Kleig had returned and entered the Secret Room.\nIn the meantime a fleet of battleships had been drawn by some mysterious\nagency out to sea from Hampton Roads, and a fleet of fighting planes\nwhich had followed the ghost column outward had not returned.\n\nNews-gatherers had spread the stories, distorted and garbled, across the\nwestern continents, and throughout the western confederacy men, women\nand children lived in the throes of the greatest fear that had ever\ngripped them. Fear held them most because they could not give the cause\nof their fear a name--save one....\n\nMoyen.... And the name was on the lips of everyone, and frenzied woman\nstilled their squalling babes with its mention.\n\nNo word yet from the Secret Room, but Prester Kleig had scarcely\nappeared from it than someone started the radio signal which informed\nthe frenzied, waiting world of the west that information, exact if\nstartling, would now be forthcoming.\n\nIn millions of homes, in thousands of high-flying planes, listeners\ntuned in at the clear-all hum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrester Kleig wasted no time in preliminaries.\n\n\"Prester Kleig speaking. We are threatened by Moyen, with scores of\nmonster submarines, each a mother ship for scores of aero-subs,\ncombinations of airplanes and miniature submarines. They are moving up\non our eastern coast, from some secret base which we have not yet\nlocated. They are equipped with death dealing instruments of which we\nhave but the most fragmentary knowledge, and for two hours I must call\nupon all flyers to combat the menace; until the Secret Agents,\nespecially Professor Maniel, have had opportunity to counteract the\nminions of Moyen.\n\n\"Flyers of the United Americas! In the name of our country I ask that\nvolunteers gather on the eastern coast, each flyer proceeding at once to\nthe nearest coast-landing, after dropping all passengers. Your\ncommanders have already been named by your various organizations, as\nrequired by franchise, and orders for the movement of the entire winged\narmada will come from this station. However, the orders will simply be\nthis: Hold Moyen's forces at bay for a period of two hours! And know\nthat many of you go to certain death, and make your own decisions as to\nwhether you shall volunteer!\"\n\nThis ended, Prester Kleig, excitement mounting high, hurried back to the\nSecret Room.\n\nNow the public knew, and as the American public is given to doing, it\nsteadied down when it knew the worst. Fear of the unknown had changed\nthe public into a myriad-souled beast gone berserk. Now that knowledge\nwas exact men grew calm of face, determined, and women assumed the\nsupporting role which down the ages has been that of brave women,\nmothers of men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA period of silence for a time after Prester Kleig's pronouncement.\n\nAs he entered the first door leading into the Secret Room, Carlos Kane\nmet and passed him with a smile.\n\n\"You called for winged volunteers, did you not, Kleig?\" he asked\nquietly.\n\nKleig nodded. \"You are going?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. It is my duty.\"\n\nNo other words were necessary, as the men shook hands. Prester Kleig\ngoing on to the Secret Room, Carlos Kane going out to join the mighty\narmada which must fight against the minions of Moyen.\n\nThe words of Prester Kleig were heard by the pilots of the sky-lanes.\nThe passenger pits, equipped with self-opening parachutes which dropped\njumpers in series of long falls in order to acquire swift but accurate\nand safe landing--they opened at intervals in long falls of two thousand\nfeet, stayed the fall, then closed again, so that drops were almost\ncontinuous until the last four hundred feet--and pilots, swiftly making\nup their minds, dropped their passengers, banked their planes, and raced\ninto the east.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll over the Americas pilots dropped their passengers and their loads if\ntheir franchises called for the carrying of freight, and banked about to\ntake part in the first skirmish with the Moyenites.\n\nDropping figures almost darkened the sky as passengers plunged downward\nafter the startling signal from Washington. Flowers, which were the\numbrellas of chutes, opened and closed like breathing winged orchids,\nletting their burdens safely to earth.\n\nAnd clouds and fleets of airplanes came in from all directions to land,\nin rows and rows which were endless, wing and wing, along the eastern\ncoast.\n\nPrester Kleig had scarcely entered the Secret Room than the hated voice\nof Moyen again broke upon the ears of the machinelike Secret Agents.\n\n\"This is madness, gentlemen! My people will annihilate yours!\"\n\nBut, since time for speech had passed, not one of the Secret Agents made\nanswer or paid the slightest heed to the warning, though deep in the\nheart of each and every one was the belief that Moyen spoke no more than\nthe truth.\n\nToo, there was a growing respect for the half-god of Asia, in that he\nwas good enough to warn them of the holocaust which faced their country.\n\nBy hundreds and thousands, wing and wing, airplanes dropped to the\nAtlantic coast at the closest point of contact, when the signal reached\nthem. At high altitudes, planes crossing the Atlantic turned back and\nreturned at top speed, dropping their passengers as soon as over land.\nThat Moyen made no move to prevent the return of flyers out over the\nocean, and now coming back, was an ominous circumstance.\n\nIt seemed to show that he held the American flyers, all of them, in\nutter contempt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrester Kleig regarded the time. It had been half an hour since Moyen\nhad spoken of attack, half an hour since the monsters of the deep had\nstarted the inexorable move toward land. On the screen the submarines\nwere bulking larger and larger as the moments fled, until it seemed to\nthe Secret Agents that the great composite shadow of them already was\nsweeping inland from the coast.\n\nAs the coast came close ahead of the monster subs the little aero-subs,\nto the surprise of the Secret Agents, all vanished into their respective\nmother ships.\n\n\"But they have to use them,\" groaned Munson. \"For their submarines are\nuseless in frontal attack against our shores!\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said Prester Kleig. \"For I have a suspicion\nthat those submarines have tractors under their keels, and that they can\ncome out on land! If this is so the monsters can, guarded by\narmour-plate, penetrate to the very heart of our most populated areas\nbefore their aero-subs are released.\"\n\nNone of the Secret Agents as yet had stopped to ponder how the monsters\nhad reached their positions, and why Moyen was attacking from the east,\nwhen the Pacific side of the continents would have appeared to be the\nobvious point of attack, and would have obviated the necessity of long,\nsecret under-sea journeys wherein discovery prematurely must have been\none of the many worries of the submarine commanders.\n\nThe mere fact of the presence of the monsters was enough. What had\npreceded their presence was unimportant, save that their presence, and\ntheir near approach to the shore undetected, further proved the\nexecutive and planning genius of Moyen.\n\nTwo miles, on an average, off the eastern coast the submarines laid\ntheir eggs--the aero-subs, which darted from the sides of the mother\nships in flights and squadrons, made the surface, and leaped into the\nsky.\n\nFive minutes later and the signal went forth to the phalanx of the\nvolunteers.\n\n\"Take off! Fly east and engage the enemy, and hold him in check, and the\nGod of our fathers go with you!\"\n\nOne hour had passed since Moyen's ultimatum when the first vanguard of\nthe American flyers, obeying the peremptory signal, took the air and\ndarted eastward to meet the winged death-harbingers of Moyen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\"_They Shall Not Pass!_\"\n\n\nPrester Kleig's heartfelt desire, as the American flyers closed with the\nfirst of the aero-subs, was to go out with them and aid them in the\nattack against the Moyenites. But he knew, and it was a tacit thing,\nthat he best served his country from the safe haven of the Secret Room.\n\nAs he watched the scenes unfold on the screen of Maniel's genius, with\noccasional glances at the somewhat mysterious but profound and\nconcentrated labors of Maniel, Charmion Kane rose from her place and\ncame to his side.\n\nWide-eyed as she watched the joining of battle, she stood there, her\ntiny hand encased in the tense one of Prester Kleig.\n\n\"You would like to be out there,\" she murmured. \"I know it! But your\ncountry needs you here--and I have already given Carlos!\"\n\nPrester Kleig tightened his grip on her hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was deep, silent understanding between these two, and Prester\nKleig, in fighting against the Moyenites, realized, even above his\nrealization that his labors were primarily for the benefit of his\ncountry, that he really matched wits with Moyen for the sake of\nCharmion. Had anyone asked him whether he would have sacrificed her for\nthe benefit of his country, it would have been a difficult question to\nanswer.\n\nHe was glad that the question was never asked.\n\n\"Yes, beloved,\" he whispered, \"I would like to be out there, but the\ngreatest need for me is here.\"\n\nBut even so he felt as though he was betraying those intrepid flyers he\nwas sending to sure death. Yet they had volunteered, and it was the only\nway.\n\nManiel, a gnomelike little man with a Titan's brain, labored with his\ncalculations, made swiftly concrete his theories, while at the\nSound-and-Vision apparatus excitable General Munson ranged the aerial\nbattlefield to see how the tide of battle ebbed and flowed.\n\nThat neither side would either ask or give quarter was instantly\napparent, for they rushed head-on to meet each other, those vast\nopposing winged armadas, at top speed, and not a single individual\nswerved from his course, though at least the Americans knew that death\nrode the skyways ahead.\n\nThen....\n\nThe battle was joined. Moyen's forces were superior in armament. Their\nsky-steeds were faster, more readily maneuverable, though the flying\nforces of the Americas in the last five years had made vast strides in\naviation. But what the Americans lacked in power they made up for in\nfearless courage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plan of battle seemed automatically to work itself out.\n\nThe first vanguard of American planes came into contact with the forces\nof Moyen, and from the noses of countless aero-subs spurted that golden\nstreak which the Secret Agents knew and dreaded.\n\nThe first flight of planes, stretching from horizon to horizon, vanished\nfrom the sky with that dreadful surety which had marked the passing of\nthe _Stellar_, and such of those warships as had felt the full force of\nthe visible ray.\n\nFrom General Munson rose a groan of anguish. These convertible fighting\nplanes had been the pride of the heart of the old warrior. To do him\ncredit, however, it was the wanton, so terribly inevitable destruction\nof the flyers themselves which affected him. It was so final, so\nabsolute--and so utterly impossible to combat.\n\n\"Wait!\" snapped Prester Kleig.\n\nFor the intrepid flyers behind that vanguard which had vanished had\nwitnessed the wholesale disintegration of the leading element of the\nvast armada, and the pilots realized on the instant that no headlong\nrush into the very noses of the aero-subs would avail anything.\n\nThe vast American formation broke into a mad maelstrom of whirling,\ndarting, diving planes. Every third plane plummeted downward, every\nsecond one climbed, and the remaining ships, even in the face of what\nhad happened to the vanished first flight, held steadily to the front.\n\nIn this mad, seemingly meaningless formation, they closed on the\naero-subs. Without having seen the fight, the Americans were aping the\naction of that one nameless flyer who had charged the aero-sub that had\nbeen destroyed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKleig remembered. A score of ships had been destroyed utterly above the\ngraveyard of dreadnoughts, yet only one aero-sub, and that quite by\nchance, had been marked off in the casualty column.\n\nDeath rode the heavens as the American flyers went into action. For\nhead-on fights, flyers went in at top speed, their planes whirling on\nthe axes of fuselages, all guns going. Planes were armored against their\nown bullets, and they were not under the necessity of watching to see\nthat they did not slay their own friends.\n\nEven so, bullets were rather ineffective against the aero-subs, whose\napparently flimsy, almost transparent outer covering diverted the\nbullets with amazing ease.\n\nA whirling maelstrom of ships. The monsters of Moyen had drawn first\nblood, if the expression may be used in an action where no blood at all\nwas drawn, but machines and men simply erased from existence.\n\nHundreds of planes already gone when the second flight of ships closed\nwith the aero-subs. Yellow streaks of death flashed from aero-sub\nnostrils, but even as aero-sub operators set their rays into motion the\nAmerican flyers in head-on charge rolled, dived or zoomed, and kept\ntheir guns going.\n\nHigh above the first flight of aero-subs, behind which another flight\nwas winging swiftly into action, American flyers tilted the noses of\ntheir planes over and dived under full power--to sure death by suicide,\nthough none knew it there at the moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese aero-subs could not be driven from the sky by usual means, and\ncould destroy American ships even before those planes could come to\nhandgrips; but they, the flyers plainly believed, could be crashed out\nof the sky and so, never guessing what besides death in resulting\ncrashes they faced, the flyers above the aero-subs, even as aero-subs in\nrear flashed in to prevent, dived down straight at the backs of the\naero-subs.\n\nIn a hundred places the dives of the Americans worked successfully, and\nAmerican planes crashed full and true, full power on, into the backs of\nthe \"flying fish.\" In some aero-subs the container of the Moyen-dealing\nagency apparently remained untouched, and airplanes and aero-subs,\nwelded together, plunged down the invisible skylanes into the sea.\n\nUnder water, some of the aero-subs were seen to keep in motion, limping\ntoward the nearest mother submarines.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Prester Kleig, \"the American flyers in such cases are\nalready dead, for Moyen will be a maniac in his tortures. Munson, do you\nhurriedly examine the mother-subs and see if you can locate Moyen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHowever, only a scattered aero-sub here and there went down without the\nstrange substance of the yellow ray being released. In most cases, upon\nthe contact of plane with aero-sub, the aero-subs and planes were\ninstantly blotted from view by the yellow, golden flames from the heart\nof the winged harbingers of Moyen.\n\nGolden flames, blinding in their brightness, dropping down, mere\nshapeless blotches, then fading out to nothingness in a matter of\nseconds--with aero-sub and airplane totally erased from action and from\nexistence.\n\nThe American flyers saw and knew now the manner of death they faced. Yet\nall along the battle front not an American tried to evade the issue and\ndraw out of the fight. A sublime, inspiring exhibition of mass courage\nwhich had not been witnessed down the years since that general\nengagement which men of the time had called the Great War.\n\nPrester Kleig turned to look at Maniel. Drops of perspiration bathed the\ncheeks of the master scientist, but his eyes were glowing like coals of\nfire. His face was set in a white mask of concentration, and Prester\nKleig knew that Maniel would find the answer to the thing he sought if\nsuch answer could be found.\n\nWould the American flyers be able to hold off the minions of Moyen until\nManiel was ready? The fight out there above the waters was a terrible\nthing, and the Americans fought and died like men inspired, yet\ninexorably the winged armada of Moyen, preceded by those licking golden\ntongues, was moving landward.\n\n\"Great God!\" cried Munson. \"Look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was really no need for the order, for every Secret Agent saw as\nsoon as did Munson. Under the sea, just off the coast, the mother-subs\nhad touched their blunt nose against the upward shelving of the sea\nbottom--had touched bottom, and were slowly but surely following the\nunderwater curve of the land, up toward the surface, like unbelievable\nantediluvian monsters out of some nightmare.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kleig quietly, \"those monsters of Moyen can move on land,\nand the aero-subs can operate from them as easily on land as under\nwater.\"\n\nKleig regarded the time, whirled to look at Professor Maniel.\n\nOne hour and forty minutes had passed since Maniel had begged for two\nhours in which to prepare some mode of effectively combatting the might\nof Moyen. Twenty minutes to go; yet the mother-subs would be ashore,\ndragging their sweating, monstrous sides out of the deep, within ten\nminutes!\n\nTen minutes ashore and there was no guessing the havoc they could cause\nto the United Americas!\n\n\"Hurry, Maniel! Hurry! Hurry!\" said Prester Kleig.\n\nBut he spoke the words to himself, though even had he spoken them aloud\nManiel would not have heard. For Maniel, for two hours, had closed his\nmind to everything that transpired outside his own thoughts, devoted to\nfoiling the power of Moyen.\n\n\"I've found him!\" snapped Munson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pointed with a shaking forefinger to one of the mother-subs crawling\nup the slant of the ocean bed, twisted one of the little nubs of the\nSound-and-Vision apparatus, and the angelic face and Satanic eyes, the\ntwisted body, of Moyen came into view.\n\nThe face was calm with dreadful purpose, and Moyen stood in the heart of\none of his monsters, his eyes turned toward the land. With a gasp of\nterror, dreadfully afraid for the first time, Prester Kleig turned and\nlooked into the eyes of Charmion....\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"It will never happen. I have faith in you!\"\n\nThere were still ten minutes of the two hours left when the mother-subs\nbroke water and started crawling inland, swiftly, surely, without\nfaltering in the slightest as they changed their element from water to\nland.\n\nAs though their appearance had been the signal, the aero-subs in action\nagainst the first line of American planes broke out of the one-sided\nfight and dived for their mother ships, while a mere handful of the\nAmerican planes started back for home to prepare anew to continue the\nstruggle.\n\nPrester Kleig gave the signal to the second monster armada which had\nremained in reserve.\n\n\"Do everything in your power to halt the march of Moyen's amphibians!\"\n\nTen minutes to go, and Professor Maniel still labored like a Titan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_Caucasia Falls Silent_\n\n\nAs the scores of amphibian monsters came lumbering forth upon dry land\nit became instantly apparent why the aero-subs had returned to the\nmother ships. For a few moments, out of the water, the amphibians were\nalmost helpless, with practically no way of attack or defense--as\nhelpless as huge turtles turned legs up.\n\nBut as each aero-sub entered its proper slot in the side of the mother\namphibian, it was turned about and the nose thrust back into the\nopening, which closed down to fit tightly about the nose of the\naero-sub, so that those flame-breathing monsters protruded from the\nsides of the amphibians in many places--transforming the amphibians into\nmonsters with hundreds of golden, licking tongues!\n\nAs, with each and every aero-sub in place, the amphibians started moving\ninland, Professor Maniel made his first move. With the tiny apparatus\nupon which he had been working, he stepped to the table before the\nSound-and-Vision apparatus and spoke softly to his compatriots.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I have finished, and it will work effectively!\"\n\nThough Maniel spoke softly, it was plain to be seen that he was proud of\nhis accomplishment, which remained only to be attached to start\nperformance.\n\nA matter of seconds....\n\nYet during those seconds was the real might, the real power for utter\ndevastation, of Moyen fully exposed!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe amphibians got under way as the airplanes of the Americas swept into\nthe fight.\n\nFrom the sides of the monsters licked out those golden tongues of\nflame--and from the front.\n\nHalf a dozen amphibians slipped into New York from the harbor side and\nstarted into the heart of the city. And between the time when Maniel had\nsaid he was ready and the moment when he made his first active move\nagainst Moyen, a half-dozen skyscrapers vanished into nothingness, the\nspots where they had stood swept as clear of debris as though the land\nhad never been reclaimed from Nature!\n\nNone was ever destined to know how many lives were lost in that first\nattack of the monsters of the golden, myriad tongues; but the monsters\nstruck in the midst of a working day when the skyscrapers were filled\nwith office workers.\n\nAnd resolve struck deep into the hearts of the Secret Agents: if Moyen\nwere turned back, he must be made to pay for the slaughter.\n\nA matter of seconds....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen a moment of deathly silence as Munson gave way at the screen for\nthe gnomelike little Professor Maniel.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen!\" snapped Maniel. \"If my theory is correct,\"\nmanipulating instruments with lightning speed as he talked, \"the\nreversion of the principle of my Vibration-Retarder--which captures\nvibrations speeding outward from the earth and transforms them once\nagain into sound and pictures audible and visible to the human ear--this\napparatus will disintegrate the monsters as our boats and planes were\ndisintegrated!\n\n\"In this I have even been compelled to manipulate in the matter of\ntime! I must not only defeat and annihilate the minions of Moyen, but\nmust work from a mathematical absurdity, so that at the moment of impact\nthat moment itself must become part of the past, sufficiently remote to\nremove the monsters at such distance from the earth that not even the\nmighty genius of Moyen can return them!\"\n\nThe whirring, gentle as the whirring of doves' wings. In the center of\nthe picture on the screen were those half-dozen amphibians laying waste\nManhattan. Maniel set his intricate, delicate machinery into motion.\n\nInstantly the amphibians there seemed to become misty, shadowy, and to\nlift out of Manhattan up above the roof-tops of skyscrapers still\nremaining, nebulous and wraithlike as ghost-shrouds--yet swinging\noutward from the earth with speed almost too swift for the eye to\ndetect.\n\nBut where the amphibians had rested there stood, reclined--in all sorts\nof postures, surprising and even a bit ridiculous--the men of Moyen who\nhad operated the monsters of Moyen!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the Central Radio tower went forth a mighty voice of command to the\nplanes which had been engaging the aero-subs off the coast.\n\n\"Slay! Slay!\"\n\nDown flashed the planes of the Americas, and their guns were blazing,\ninaudibly, but none the less deadly of aim and of purpose, straight into\nthe midst of the men of Moyen who had thus been left marooned and almost\nhelpless with the vanishing of their amphibians.\n\nAnd, noting how they fell in strangled, huddled heaps before the\nvengeful fire of the American planes, the Secret Agents sighed, and\nManiel, his face alight with the pride of accomplishment, switched to\nanother point along the coast.\n\nAnd as a new group of the monsters of Moyen came into view, and Maniel\nbent to his labors afresh, the hated voice of the master mobster broke\nonce more in the Secret Room.\n\n\"Enough, Kleig! Enough! We will surrender to save lives! I stipulate\nonly that my own life be spared!\"\n\nTo which Prester Kleig made instant reply.\n\n\"Did you offer us choice of surrender? Did you spare the lives of our\npeople which, with your control of your golden rays, you could easily\nhave done? No! Nor will we spare lives, least of all the life of Moyen!\"\n\nThe whirring again, as of the whirring of doves' wings. More metal\nmonsters, even as golden tongues spewed forth from their many sides,\nvanished from view, leaping skyward, while the operators of them were\nleft to the mercies of the remaining airmen of the Americans.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVoicelessly the word went forth:\n\n\"Slay! Slay!\"\n\nIt was Charmion who begged for mercy for the vanquished as, one by one,\nas surely as fate, the monsters with their contained aero-subs were\nblotted out, leaving pilots and operators behind them. Down upon these\ndropped the airmen of the West, slaying without mercy....\n\n\"Please, lover!\" Charmion whispered. \"Spare them!\"\n\n\"Even...?\" he began, thinking of Moyen, who would have taken Charmion.\nHe felt her shudder as she read his mind, understood what he would have\nasked.\n\n\"There he is!\" came softly from Munson.\n\nAn amphibian had just been disintegrated, had just climbed mistily,\nswiftly, into invisibility in the skies. And there in the midst of the\nconquerors left behind, his angel's face set in a moody mask, his pale\neyes awful with fear, his misshapen body sagging, terrible in its\nrealization of failure, was Moyen!\n\nEven as Kleig prepared to give the mercy signal, a plane dived down on\nthe group about Moyen, and the Secret Agents could see the hand of the\npilot, lifted high, as though he signaled.\n\nThe plane was a Mayther! The pilot was Carlos Kane!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust as Kane went into action, and the noiseless bullets from his ship\ncrashed into that twisted body, causing it to jump and twitch with the\nmight of them, Prester Kleig gave the signal.\n\nEven as the figure of Moyen crashed to the soil and the man's soul\nquitted its mortal casement, Kleig commanded:\n\n\"Spare all who surrender! Make them prisoners, to be used to repair the\ndamage they have done to our country! Guards will be instantly placed\nover the amphibians and the aero-subs--for the day may come when we\nshall need to know their secrets!\"\n\nAnd, as men, hands lifted high in token of surrender, quitted the now\nmotionless amphibians, and flyers dropped down to make them prisoners,\nManiel sighed, pressed various buttons on his apparatus, and the mad\nscene of carnage they had witnessed for hours faded slowly out, and\ndarkness and silence filled the Secret Room.\n\nBut darkness is the joy of lovers, and in the midst of silence that was\nalmost appalling by contrast, Kleig and Charmion were received into each\nother's arms.\n\n\n                   +---------------------------+\n                   |    Everyone Is Invited    |\n                   |    _To \"Come Over in_     |\n                   |  'THE READERS' CORNER'\"!  |\n                   +---------------------------+\n\n\n\n\nVampires of Venus\n\n_By Anthony Pelcher_\n\n[Illustration: _He seized a short knife and threw himself forward._]\n\n  Leslie Larner, an entomologist borrowed from the Earth, pits himself\n  against the night-flying vampires that are ravaging the inhabitants\n  of Venus.\n\n\nIt was as if someone had thrown a bomb into a Quaker meeting, when\nadventure suddenly began to crowd itself into the life of the studious\nand methodical Leslie Larner, professor of entomology.\n\nFame had been his since early manhood, when he began to distinguish\nhimself in several sciences, but the adventure and thrills he had longed\nfor had always fallen to the lot of others.\n\nHis father, a college professor, had left him a good working brain and\nnothing else. Later his mother died and he was left with no relatives in\nthe world, so far as he knew. So he gave his life over to study and hard\nwork.\n\nStill youthful at twenty-five, he was hoping that fate would \"give him\na break.\" It did.\n\nHe was in charge of a Government department having to do with Oriental\nbeetles, Hessian flies, boll weevils and such, and it seemed his life\nhad been just one bug after another. He took creeping, crawling things\nseriously and believed that, unless curbed, insects would some day crowd\nman off the earth. He sounded an alarm, but humanity was not disturbed.\nSo Leslie Larner fell back on his microscope and concerned himself with\nsaving cotton, wheat and other crops. His only diversion was fishing for\nthe elusive rainbow trout.\n\nHe managed to spend a month each year in the Colorado Rockies angling\nfor speckled beauties.\n\nLarner was anything but a clock-watcher, but on a certain bright day in\nJune he was seated in his laboratory doing just that.\n\n\"Just five minutes to go,\" he mused.\n\nIt was just 4:25 P. M. He had finished his work, put his affairs in\norder, and in five minutes would be free to leave on a much needed and\nwell earned vacation. His bags were packed and at the station. His\nfishing tackle, the pride of his young life, was neatly rolled in oiled\nsilk and stood near at hand.\n\n\"I'll just fill my calabash, take one more quiet smoke, and then for the\nmountains and freedom,\" he told himself. He settled back with his feet\non his desk. He half closed his eyes in solid comfort. Then the bomb\nfell and exploded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nB-r-r-r-r!\n\nThe buzzer on his desk buzzed and his feet came off the desk and hit the\nfloor with a thud. His eyes popped open and the calabash was immediately\nlaid aside.\n\nThat buzzer usually meant business, and it would be his usual luck to\nhave trouble crash in on him just as he was on the edge of a rainbow\ntrout paradise.\n\nA messenger was ushered into the room by an assistant. The boy handed\nhim an envelope, said, \"No answer,\" and departed.\n\nLarner tore open the envelope lazily. He read and then re-read its\ncontents, while a look of puzzled surprise disturbed his usually placid\ncountenance. He spread the sheet of paper out on his desk, and for the\ntenth time he read:\n\n    Confidential.\n\n    Memorize this address and destroy this paper:\n\n    Tula Bela, 1726 88th Street, West, City of Hesper, Republic of\n    Pana, Planet Venus.\n\n    Will meet you in the Frying Pan.\n\nThat was all. It was enough. Larner lost his temper. He crumpled the\npaper and tossed it in the waste basket. He was not given to profanity,\nbut he could say \"Judas Priest\" in a way that sizzled.\n\n\"Judas Priest!\" he spluttered. \"Anyone who would send a man a crazy\nbunch of nonsense like that, at a time like this, ought to be snuffed\nout like a beetle!\n\n\"'Meet you in the Frying Pan,'\" he quoted. Then he happened to recall\nsomething. \"By golly, there is a fishing district in Colorado known as\nthe Frying Pan. That's not so crazy, but the planet Venus part surely is\ncuckoo.\"\n\nHe fished the paper out of the waste basket, found the envelope, placed\nthe strange message within and put it in his inside coat pocket. Then he\nseized his suitcase and fishing tackle, and, rushing out, hailed a taxi.\nNot long after he was on his way west by plane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the country unrolled under him he retrieved the strange note from his\npocket. He read it again and again. Then he examined the envelope. It\nwas an ordinary one of good quality, designed for business rather than\nsocial usage. The note paper appeared quite different. It was unruled,\npure white, and of a texture which might be described as pebbly. It was\nstrongly made, and of a nature unlike any paper Larner had ever seen\nbefore. It appeared to have been made from a fiber rather than a pulp.\n\n\"Wonder who wrote it?\" Larner asked himself. \"It is beautiful\nhandwriting, masculine yet artistic. Wonder where he got the Frying Pan\nidea? At any rate, I'm not going to the Frying Pan this year--I'm\ncamping on Tennessee Creek, in Lake County, Colorado. The country there\nis more beautiful and restful.\n\n\"But this street address on the planet Venus. Seems to me I read\nsomewhere that Marconi had received mysterious signals that he believed\ncame from the planet Venus. Hesper, Hesper ... it sounds familiar,\nsomehow. Wonder if there could be anything to it?\"\n\nSomething impelled him to follow out the instructions in the note. He\nspent the next few hours repeating the address over and over again. When\nhe was satisfied that he had memorized it thoroughly, he tore the\nstrange paper into bits and sent it fluttering earthward like a tiny\nsnowstorm.\n\nLarner was not a gullible individual, but neither was he unimaginative.\nHe was scientist enough to know that \"the impossibilities of to-day are\nthe accomplishments of to-morrow.\" So while not convinced that the note\nwas a serious communication, still his mind was open.\n\nThe weird address insisted on creeping into his mind and driving out\nother thoughts, even those of his speckled playfellows, the rainbow\ntrout.\n\n\"I've a notion to change my plans and go from Denver to the Frying Pan,\"\nhe cogitated. Then he thought, \"No, I won't take it that seriously.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnyone who knows the Colorado Rockies knows paradise. There is no more\nbeautiful country on the globe. Lake County, where Larner had chosen\nhis fishing grounds, has as its seat the old mining camp of Leadville.\nIt has been visited and settled more for its gold mines than the golden\nglow of its sunsets above the clouds, but the gold of the sunsets is\neternal, while the gold of the mines is fading quickly away.\n\nLeadville, with its 5,000 inhabitants, nestles above the clouds, at an\naltitude of more than 10,000 feet. Mount Massive with its three peaks\nlies back of the town in panorama and rises to a height of some 14,400\nfeet. In the rugged mountains thereabouts are hundreds of lakes fed by\nwild streams and bubbling crystal springs. All these lakes are above the\nclouds.\n\nWinter sees the whole picture decorated with bizarre snowdrifts from\ntwenty to forty feet deep, but spring comes early. The beautiful\ncolumbines and crocuses bloom before the snow is all off the ground in\nthe valleys. The lands up to 12,000 feet altitude are carpeted with a\nlight green grass and moss. Giant pines and dainty aspens, with their\nsilvery bark and pinkish leaves blossom forth and whisper, while the\neternal snows still linger in the higher rocky cliffs and peaks above.\n\nIndian-paint blooms its blood red in contrast to the milder colorings.\nBlackbirds and bluebirds chatter and chipmunks chirp. The gold so hard\nto find in the mines glares from the skies. The hills cuddle in banks of\nsnowy clouds, and above all a pure clear blue sky sweeps. The lakes and\nstreams abound with rainbow trout, the gamest of any fresh water fish.\nIt is indeed a paradise for either poet or sportsman.\n\nIn any direction near to Leadville a man can find Heaven and recreation\nand rest.\n\nFinding himself on Harrison Avenue, the main street of the county seat,\nLarner, after renewing some old acquaintanceships, started west in a\nflivver for Tennessee Creek. The flivver is a modern adjustment. Until\na few years ago the only means of traversing these same hills was by\npatient, sure-footed donkeys, which carried the pack while the wayfarer\nwalked along beside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first day's fishing was good. Trout seemed to greet him cheerily and\nsprang eagerly to the fray. They bit at any sort of silken fly he cast.\n\nThe site chosen by Larner for his camp was in a mossy clearing separated\nfrom the stream by a fringe of willows along the creek. Then came a\nborder of aspens backed by a forest of silver-tipped firs.\n\nIt was ideal and his eyes swept the scene with satisfaction. Then he\nbegan whittling bacon to grease his pan for frying trout over the open\nfire.\n\nSuddenly he heard a rustle in the aspens, and, looking up, beheld a\npicture which made his eyes bulge. A man and a woman, garbed seemingly\nin the costumes of another world, walked toward him. Neither were more\nthan five feet tall but were physically perfect, and marvelously\npleasing to the eye. There was little difference in their dress.\n\nBoth wore helmets studded with what Larner believed to be sapphires. He\nlearned later they were diamonds. Their clothing consisted of tight\ntrouserlike garments surmounted by tunics of some white pelt resembling\nchamois save for color. A belt studded with precious stones encircled\ntheir waists. Artistic laced sandals graced their small firm feet.\n\nTheir skin was a pinkish white. Their every feature was perfection plus,\nand their bodies curved just enough wherever a curve should be. The\nwoman was daintier and more fully developed, and her features were even\nmore finely chiseled than the man. Otherwise it would have been\ndifficult to distinguish their sex.\n\nLarner took in these details subconsciously, for he was awed beyond\nexpression. All he could do was to stand seemingly frozen, half bent\nover the campfire with his frying pan in his hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man spoke.\n\n\"I hope we did not startle you,\" he said. \"I thought my note would\npartly prepare you for this meeting. We expected to find you in the\nFrying Pan district. When you did not appear there we tuned our radio\nlocator to your heart beats and in that way located you here. It was\nhardly a second's space-flying time from where we were.\"\n\nLarner said nothing. He could only stand and gape.\n\n\"I do not wonder that you are surprised,\" said the strange little man.\n\"I will explain that I am Nern Bela, of the City of Hesper, on the\nplanet Venus. This is my sister Tula. We greet you in the interest of\nthe Republic of Pana, which embraces all of the planet you know as\nVenus.\"\n\nWhen Larner recovered his breath, he lost his temper.\n\n\"I don't know what circus you escaped from, but I crave solitude and I\nhave no time to be bothered with fairy tales,\" he said with brutal\nbruskness.\n\nExpressions of hurt surprise swept the countenances of his visitors.\n\nThe man spoke again:\n\n\"We are just what we assert we are, and our finding you was made\nnecessary by a condition which grieves the souls of all the 900,000,000\ninhabitants of Venus. We have come to plead with you to come with us and\nuse your scientific knowledge to thwart a scourge which threatens the\nlives of millions of people.\"\n\nThere was a quiet dignity about the man and an air of pride about the\nwoman which made Larner stop and think, or try to. He rubbed his hand\nover his brow and looked questioningly at the pair.\n\n\"If you are what you say you are, how did you get here?\" he asked.\n\n\"We came in a targo, a space-flying ship, capable of doing 426,000 miles\nan hour. This is just 1200 times as fast as 355 miles an hour, the\nhighest speed known on earth. Come with us and we will show you our\nship.\" They looked at him appealingly, and both smiled a smile of\nwistful friendliness.\n\nLarner, without a word, threw down his frying pan and followed them\nthrough the aspens. The brother and sister walking ahead of him gave his\neyes a treat. He surveyed the perfect form of the girl. Her perfection\nwas beyond his ken.\n\n\"They certainly are not of this world,\" he mused.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few hundred yards farther on there was a beach of pebbles, where the\nstream had changed its course. On this plot sat a gigantic spherical\nmachine of a glasslike material. It was about 300 feet in diameter and\nit was tapered on two sides into tees which Larner rightly took to be\nlights.\n\n\"This is a targo, our type of space-flyer,\" said Nern Bela. \"It is\ncapable of making two trips a year between Venus and the earth. We have\nvisited this planet often, always landing in some mountain or jungle\nfastness as heretofore we did not desire earth-dwellers to know of our\npresence.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Larner, his mouth agape and his eyes protruding. His\nmind was so full of questions that he fairly blurted his first one.\n\n\"Because,\" said Bela, slowly and frankly, \"because our race knows no\nsickness and we feared contagion, as your race has not yet learned to\ncontrol its being.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Lamer thoughtfully. He realized that humans of the earth,\nwhom he had always regarded as God's most perfect beings, were not so\nperfect after all.\n\n\"How do you people control your being, as you express it?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is simple,\" was the reply. \"For ninety centuries we have ceased to\nbreed imperfection, crime and disease. We deprived no one of the\npleasures of life, but only the most perfect mental and physical\nspecimens of our people cared to have children. In other words, while we\nmake no claim to controlling our sex habits, we do control results.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Larner again.\n\nNern Bela led the way to a door which opened into the side of the\nspace-flyer near its base. \"We have a crew of four men and four women,\"\nhe said. \"They handle the entire ship, with my sister and I in command,\nmaking six souls aboard in all.\"\n\n\"Why men and women?\" thought Larner.\n\nAs if in answer to his thought Bela said:\n\n\"On the earth the two sexes have struggled for sex supremacy. This has\nthrown your civilization out of balance. On Venus we have struggled for\nsex equality and have accomplished it. This is a perfect balance. Man\nand women engage in all endeavor and share all favors and rewards\nalike.\"\n\n\"In war, too?\" asked Larner.\n\n\"There has not been war on Venus for 600,000 years,\" said Bela. \"There\nis only the one nation, and the people all live in perfect accord. Our\nonly trouble in centuries is a dire peril which now threatens our\npeople, and it is of this that I wish to talk to you more at length.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were standing close to the targo. Larner was struck by the peculiar\nmaterial of which it was constructed. There was a question in his eyes,\nand Nern Bela answered it:\n\n\"The metal is duranium; it is metalized quartz. It is frictionless,\nconducts no current or ray except repulsion and attraction ray NTR69X6\nby which it is propelled. It is practically transparent, lighter than\nair and harder than a diamond. It is cast in moulds after being melted\nor, rather, fused.\n\n\"We use cold light which we produce by forcing oxygen through air tubes\ninto a vat filled with the fat of a deep sea fish resembling your whale.\nYou are aware, of course, that that is exactly how cold light is\nproduced by the firefly, except for the fact that the firefly uses his\nown fat.\"\n\nLarner was positively fascinated. He smoothed the metal of the targo in\nappreciation of its marvelous construction, but he longed most to see\nthe curious light giving mechanism, for this was closer to his own line\nof entomology. He had always believed that the light giving organs of\nfireflys and deep-sea fishes could be reproduced mechanically.\n\nThe interior of the ship resembled in a vague way that of an ocean\nliner. It was controlled by an instrument board at which a man and a\ngirl sat. They did not raise their heads as the three people entered.\n\nWhen called by Bela and his sister, who seemed to give commands in\nunison, the crew assembled and were presented to the visitor.\n\n\"Earth-dwellers are not the curiosity to us that we seem to be to you,\"\nsaid Tula Bela, speaking for the first time and smiling sweetly.\n\nLarner was too engrossed to note the remark further than to nod his\nhead. He was lost in contemplation of these strange people, all garbed\nexactly alike and all surpassingly lovely to look upon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn odor of food wafted from the galley, and Larner remembered he was\nhungry, with the hunger of health. He had swung his basket of fish over\nhis shoulder when he left his campfire, and Tula took it from him.\n\n\"Would you like to have our chef prepare them for you?\" she said, as she\ncaught his hungry glance at his day's catch. This time Larner answered\nher.\n\n\"If you will pardon me,\" he said awkwardly. \"Really I am famished.\"\n\n\"You will not miss your fish dinner,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I believe there is enough for all of us,\" said Larner. \"I caught twenty\nbeauties. I never knew fish to bite like that. Why, they--\" and he was\noff on a voluminous discourse on a favorite subject.\n\nThose assembled listened sympathetically. Then Tula took the fish, and\nsoon the aroma of broiling trout mingled with the other entrancing\ngalley odors.\n\nAfter a dinner at which some weird yet satisfying viands were served and\nmuch unusual conversation indulged in, Nern Bela led the way to what\nappeared to be the captain's quarters. The crew and their visitor sat\ndown to discuss a subject which proved to be of such a terrifying nature\nas to scar human souls.\n\n\"People on Venus,\" said Nern, as his eyes took on a worried expression,\n\"are unable to leave their homes after nightfall due to some strange\nnocturnal beast which attacks them and vampirishly drains all blood from\ntheir veins, leaving the dead bodies limp and empty.\"\n\n\"What? How?\" questioned Larner leaning far forward over the conference\ntable.\n\nThe others nodded their heads, and in the eyes of the women there was\nterror. Larner could not but believe this.\n\n\"The beasts, or should I say insects, are as large as your horses and\nthey fly, actually fly, by night, striking down humans, domestic animals\nand all creatures of warm blood. How many there are we have no means of\nknowing, and we cannot find their hiding and breeding places. They are\nnot native to our planet, and where they come from we cannot imagine.\nThey are actually monstrous flys, or bugs, or some form of insects.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLarner was overcome by incredulity and showed it. \"Insects as big as\nhorses?\" he questioned and he could hardly suppress a smile.\n\n\"Believe us, in the name of the God of us all,\" insisted Nern. \"They\nhave a mouth which consists of a large suction disk, in the center of\nwhich is a lancelike tongue. The lance is forced into the body at any\nconvenient point, and the suction disk drains out the blood. If we only\nknew their source! They attack young children and the aged, up to five\nhundred years, alike.\"\n\n\"What! Five hundred years?\" exploded Larner again.\n\n\"I should have explained,\" said Nern, simply, \"that Venus dwellers, due\nto our advanced knowledge of sanitation and health conversation, live\nabout 800 years and then die invariably of old age. The only unnatural\ncause of death encountered is this giant insect. Accidents do occur, but\nthey are rare. There are no deliberate killings on Venus.\"\n\nLarner did not answer. He only pondered. The more he ran over the\nstrange happenings of the last week in his mind the more he believed he\nwas dreaming. His thoughts took a strange turn: \"Why do these vain\npeople go around dressed in jeweled ornaments?\"\n\nNern again anticipated a question. \"Diamonds, gold and many of what you\ncall precious stones are common on Venus,\" he volunteered. \"Talc and\nmany other things are more valuable.\"\n\n\"Talc?\"\n\n\"Yes, we use an immense quantity of it. We have a wood that is harder\nthan your steel. We build machinery with it. We cannot use oil to\nlubricate these wooden shafts and bearings as it softens the wood, so\nall parts exposed to friction are sprayed constantly by a gust of talc\nfrom a blower.\n\n\"You use talc mostly for toilet purposes. We use it for various\npurposes. There is little left on Venus, and it is more valuable to us\nthan either gold or diamonds. We draw on your planet now for talc. You\ndump immense quantities. We just shipped one hundred 1,000-ton globes of\nit from the Cripple Creek district, and the district never missed it. We\ndrew most of it from your mine dumps.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNern tried not to look bored as he explained more in detail: \"We brought\n100 hollow spheres constructed of duranium. We suspended these over the\nCripple Creek district at an altitude of 10,000 feet above the earth's\nsurface. Because of the crystal glint of duranium they were invisible to\nearth dwellers at that height. Then we used a suction draft at night,\ndrawing the talc from the earth, filling one drum after another. This is\ndone by tuning in a certain selective attraction that attracts only\ntalc. It draws it right out of your ground in tiny particles and\nassembles it in the transportation drums as pure talc. On the earth, if\nnoticed at all, it would have been called a dust storm.\n\n\"The drums, when loaded with talc, are set to attract the proper\nplanetary force and they go speeding toward Venus at the rate of 426,000\nmiles an hour. They are prevented from colliding with meteors by an\nautomatic magnetic device. This is controlled by magnetic force alone,\nand when the targo gets too close to a meteor it changes its course\ninstantly. The passenger targo we ride in acts similarly. And now may I\nreturn to the subject of the vampires of Venus?\"\n\n\"Pardon my ignorance,\" said Larner, and for the first time in his life\nhe felt very ignorant indeed.\n\n\"I know little more than I have told you,\" said Nern, rather hopelessly.\n\"Our knowledge of your world, your people and your language comes from\nour listening in on you and observing you without being observed or\nheard. This might seem like taking an advantage of you, were it not for\nthe fact that we respect confidences, and subjugate all else to science.\nWe have helped you at times, by telepathically suggesting ideas to your\nthinkers.\n\n\"We would have given you all our inventions in this way, gladly, but in\nmany instances we were unable to find minds attuned to accept such\nadvanced ideas. We have had the advantage of you because our planet is\nso many millions of years older than your own.\" There was a plaintive\nnote in Nern's voice as he talked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But now we are on our knees to you, so to speak. We do not know\neverything and, desperately, we need the aid of a man of your caliber.\nIn behalf of the distraught people of Venus, I am asking you bluntly to\nmake a great sacrifice. Will you face the dangers of a trip to Venus and\nuse your knowledge to aid us in exterminating these creatures of hell?\"\nThere was positive pleading in his voice, and in the eyes of his\nbeautiful sister there were tears.\n\n\"But what would my superiors in the Government Bureau think?\" feebly\nprotested Larner, \"I could not explain....\"\n\n\"You have no superiors in your line. Our Government needs you at this\ntime more than any earthly government. Your place here is a fixture. You\ncan always return to it, should you live. We are asking you to face a\nhorrible death with us. You can name your own compensation, but I know\nyou are not interested so much in reward.\n\n\"Now, honestly, my good professor, there is no advantage to be gained by\nexplanation. Just disappear. In the name of God and in the interests of\nscience and the salvation of a people who are at your mercy, just drop\nout of sight. Drop out of life on this planet. Come with us. The cause\nis worthy of the man I believe you to be.\"\n\n\"I will go,\" said Larner, and his hosts waited for no more. An instant\nlater the targo shot out into interstellar space.\n\n\"How do you know what course to follow?\" asked Larner after a reasonable\ntime, when he had recovered from his surprise at the sudden take-off.\n\n\"We do not need to know. Our machine is tuned to be attracted by the\nplanetary force of Venus alone. We could not go elsewhere. A repulsion\nray finds us as we near Venus and protects us against too violent a\nlanding. We will land on Venus like a feather about three months from\nto-night.\"\n\nThe time of the journey through outer space was of little moment save\nfor one incident. Larner and the other travelers were suddenly and\nrather rudely jostled about the rapidly flying craft.\n\nLarner lost his breath but not his speech. \"What happened?\" he inquired.\n\n\"We just automatically dodged a meteor,\" explained Nern.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMost of the time of the trip was spent by Larner in listening to\nexplanations of customs and traditions of the people of the brightest\nplanet in the universe.\n\nThere was a question Larner had desired to ask Nern Bela, yet he\nhesitated to do so. Finally one evening during the journey to Venus,\nwhen the travelers had been occupying themselves in a scientific\ndiscussion of comparative evolution on the two planets, Larner saw his\nopportunity.\n\n\"Why,\" he asked rather hesitatingly, \"did the people of Venus always\nremain so small? Why did you not strive more for height? The Japanese,\nwho are the shortest in stature of earth people, always wanted to be\ntall.\"\n\n\"Without meaning any offense,\" replied Nern, \"I must say that it is\ncharacteristic of earth dwellers to want something without knowing any\ngood reason why they want it. It is perfectly all right for you people\nto be tall, but for us it is not so fitting. You see, Venus is smaller\nthan the earth. Size is comparative. You think we are not tall because\nyou are used to taller people. Comparatively we are tall enough. In\nproportion to the size of our planet we are exactly the right size. We\nkeep our population at 900,000,000, and that is the perfectly exact\nnumber of people who can live comfortably on our planet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArriving on Venus, Larner was assigned a laboratory and office in one of\nthe Government buildings. It was a world seemingly made of glass.\nQuartz, of rose, white and crystal coloring, Larner found, was the\ncommonest country rock of the planet. In many cases it was shot full of\nsplinters of gold which the natives had not taken the trouble to\nrecover. This quartz was of a terrific hardness and was used in\nbuilding, paving, and public works generally. The effect was\nbewildering. It was a world of shimmering crystal.\n\nThe atmosphere of Venus had long puzzled Larner. While not an astronomer\nin the largest sense of the word, yet he had a keen interest in the\nheavens as a giant puzzle picture, and he had given some spare time to\nthe study.\n\nHe knew that from all indications Venus had a most unusual atmosphere.\nHe had read that the atmosphere was considerably denser than that of the\nearth, and that its presence made observation difficult. The actual\nsurface of the planet he knew could hardly be seen due, either to this\natmosphere, or seemingly perpetual cloud banks.\n\nHe had read that the presence of atmosphere surrounding Venus is\nindicated to earthly astronomers, during the planet's transit, by rings\nof light due to the reflection and scattering of collected sunlight by\nits atmosphere.\n\nAstronomers on earth, he knew, had long been satisfied of the presence\nof great cloud banks, as rocks and soils could not have such high\nreflecting power. He knew that like the moon, Venus, when viewed from\nthe earth, presents different phases from the crescent to the full or\ntotal stage.\n\nLooking up at the sky from the quartz streets of Venus, Larner beheld,\nin sweeping grandeur, massed cloud banks, many of them apparently rain\nclouds.\n\nNern noted his skyward gaze, and said:\n\n\"We have accomplished meteorological control. Those clouds were brought\nunder control when we conquered interplanetary force, and what you call\ngravity. We form them and move them at will. They are our rain factory.\nWe make rain when and where we will. This insures our crops and makes\nfor health and contentment.\n\n\"The air, you will note, is about the same or a little more moist than\nthe earth air at sea level. This is due to the planet's position nearer\nthe sun.\n\n\"We have been striving for centuries to make the air a little drier and\nmore rare, but we have not succeeded yet. The heavy content of\ndisintegrated quartz in our soil makes moisture very necessary for our\ncrops, so our moist atmosphere is evidently a provision of providence.\nWe are used to breathing this moist air, and when I first visited the\nearth I was made uncomfortable by your rarified atmosphere. Now I can\nadjust myself to breathing the air of either planet. However, I find\nmyself drinking a great deal more water on earth than on Venus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn this fairyland which had enjoyed centuries of peace, health and\naccord, stark terror now reigned. In some instances the finely-bred,\nmarvellously intelligent people were in a mental condition bordering on\nmadness.\n\nThis was especially true in the farming districts, where whole herds of\nlats had been wiped out. Lats, Larner gleaned, were a common farm animal\nsimilar to the bovine species on earth, only more wooly. On these\ncreatures the Venus dwellers depended for their milk and dairy supplies,\nand for their warmer clothing, which was made from the skin. The hair\nwas used for brushes, in the building trades, and a thousand ways in\nmanufacturing.\n\nBesides the domestic animals hundreds of people continued to meet death,\nand only a few of the flying vampires had been hunted down. The giant\ninsects were believed to breed slowly as compared to earth insects,\ntheir females producing not more than ten eggs, by estimate, after which\ndeath overtook the adult. In spite of this they were reported to be\nincreasing.\n\nIn the Government building Larner was placed in touch with all the\nGovernment scientists of Venus. His nearest collaborator was one Zorn\nZada, most profound scientist of the planet. The two men, with a score\nof assistants, worked elbow to elbow on the most gigantic scientific\nmystery in the history of two planets.\n\nA specimen of the dread invader was mounted and studied by the\nscientists, who were so engrossed in their work that they hardly took\ntime to eat. As for sleep, there was little of it. Days were spent in\nresearch and nights in hunting the monsters. This hunting was done by\nnewly recruited soldiers and scientists. The weapons used were a short\nray-gun of high destructive power which disintegrated the bodies of the\nenemies by atomic energy blasts. The quarry was wary, however, and\nstruck at isolated individuals rather than massed fighting lines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeated at his work-bench Larner asked Zorn Zada what had become of Nern\nBela. In his heart he had a horrible lurking fear that the beautiful\nTula Bela might fall before a swarm of the strange vampires, but he did\nnot voice this anxiety.\n\n\"Nern and his sister are explorers and navigators,\" was the reply. \"They\nhave been assigned to carry you anywhere on this or any other planet\nwhere your work may engage you. They await your orders. They are too\nvaluable as space-navigators to be placed in harm's way.\"\n\nBreathing a sigh of relief, Larner bent to his labors.\n\n\"What other wild animals or harmful insects have you on this planet?\" he\nasked Zorn.\n\n\"I get your thought,\" replied the first scientist of Venus. \"You are\nseeking a natural enemy to this deadly flying menace, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Larner.\n\n\"All insects left on Venus with this one exception are beneficial,\" said\nZorn. \"There are no wild animals, and no harmful insects. All animals,\ninsects and birds have been domesticated and are fed by their keepers.\nWe get fabrics from forms of what you call spiders and other\nweb-builders and cocoon spinners. All forms of birds, beasts and\ncrawling and flying things have been brought under the dominion of man.\nWe will have to seek another way out than by finding an enemy parasite.\"\n\n\"Where do you think these insect invaders came from?\" asked Larner.\n\n\"You have noticed they are unlike anything you have on earth in\nanatomical construction,\" said the savant. \"They partake of the general\nfeatures of Coleoptera (beetles), in that they wear a sheath of armor,\nyet their mouth parts are more on the order of the Diptera (flys). I\nregard them more as a fly than a beetle, because most Coleoptera are\nhelpful to humanity while practically all, if not all, Diptera are\nmalignant.\n\n\"As to their original habitat, I believe they migrated here from some\nother planet.\"\n\n\"They could not fly through space,\" said Larner.\n\n\"No, that is the mystery of it,\" agreed Zorn. \"How they got here and\nwhere they breed are the questions that we have to answer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLong days passed on Venus. Long days and sleepless nights. The big\ninsects were hunted nightly by men armed with ray-guns, and nightly the\nblood-sucking monsters took their toll of humanity and animals.\n\nFinally Larner and Zorn determined to capture one of the insects alive,\nmuzzle its lance and suction pad, and give it sufficient freedom to find\nits way back to its hiding place. By following the shackled monster the\nscientists hoped to find the breeding grounds.\n\nAll the provinces of the planet joined in the drive. Men turned out in\nautomatic vehicles, propelled by energy gathered from the atmosphere.\nThey came on foot and in aircraft. Mobilization was at given points and,\nleading the van, were Zorn and Larner and their confreres in the targo\nof Nern and Tula Bela. The great army of Venus carried giant\nsearchlights and was armed with deadly ray-guns.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHeadquarters of the vast Army of Offense was in the targo of the Belas.\nLarner was in supreme command. Just before the big army set out to scour\nthe planet to seek the breeding place of the monsters Larner issued a\nbulletin that set all Venus by the ears.\n\nAddressed to President Vole Vesta of the Republic of Pana and the good\npeople of Venus, it read:\n\n    As is generally known, it has been the habit of the nation's\n    space-flying merchantmen to visit the sunlit side of the planet\n    Mercury to obtain certain rare woods and other materials not found\n    on this planet.\n\n    One side of Mercury, as is known, is always turned from the sun and\n    is in a condition of perpetual night. In this perpetual darkness\n    and dampness, where many rivers flow into warm black swamps, the\n    vampires have bred for centuries. Conditions were ideal for their\n    growth, and so through the ages they evolved into the monsters we\n    have encountered lately on Venus.\n\n    During some comparatively recent visit to Mercury the grubs of\n    these insects have found their way abroad a vegetation-laden targo\n    left standing near the edge of the black swamps of Mercury. These\n    grubs were thus transported to Venus and underwent their natural\n    metamorphosis here. Reaching adult stage, they have found some\n    place to hide and breed, and thus is explained the origin of the\n    vampires of Venus.\n\nThis was widely read and discussed and was finally accepted as the means\nof the invasion of peaceful, beautiful Venus by a horror that might well\nhave originated in hell.\n\nHowever, this did not reveal the breeding grounds, or remove the\nnation-wide scourge of the horrible winged vampires, so the mobilization\nof all the forces of the planet continued.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs day followed day the hordes of fighting Venus dwellers grew in the\nconcentration camps. In the targo of the Belas, Larner, brain-weary and\nbody-racked as he was with overwork, found a grain of happiness in being\nin the presence of Nern and his beautiful, petite sister.\n\nWith Zorn, Larner was supervising the construction of a big net of\nstrongly woven wire mesh, in which it was hoped to catch one of the\nvampires. It was decided to bait the trap with a fat female lat.\n\nZorn, Larner and the Belas fared forth from the concentration camp\nfollowed by a company of soldiers carrying the big net. Tula with her\nown hand led the fat lat heifer. His eyes were filled with commiseration\nfor the poor animal.\n\nThousands of soldiers and citizenry, in fighting array, watched the\ndeparture of the little group.\n\nIn a glade the trap was set and the net arranged to fall over the\nmonster once it attacked the calf. From a thicket, in utter darkness,\nZorn and Larner and the two Belas waited for the possible catch. The\nwhole nation stood awaiting the order to advance.\n\nOn the fourth night the vigil was rewarded in a manner frightful to\nrelate.\n\nA clumsy flutter of giant wings broke the stillness.\n\nThe four waiting forms in the thicket rejoiced, believing the fat lat\nwas about to be attacked.\n\nOnward came the approaching horror. The measured flap, flap of its\narmored wings drawing nearer and nearer. Then, horror--horrors!\n\nA feminine scream rent the air. Cries loud and shrill arose above a\nhysterical feminine cry for help.\n\nThe monster had chosen Tula Bela for its prey!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZorn exploded an alarm bomb. A compressed air siren brought the army\nforward on the run. Giant floodlights began to light up the scene. The\nblood of Larner and Nern froze.\n\nThe monster had borne the girl to the ground. Its frightful lance and\ncupper was upraised to strike. Larner was the nearest and the quickest\nto act. He grabbed for his ray-gun, swung at his belt. It was gone! In\nhorror he remembered he had left it at the base. He seized a short knife\nand threw himself forward, rolling his body between that of the girl and\nthe descending lance and cupper.\n\nAs the lance pierced his shoulder Larner, in one wild gesture of frenzy,\ndrove his knife through the soft, yielding flesh of the vampire's organ\nof suction.\n\nProtected by no bony structure the snout of the monster was amputated.\n\nThe terrible creature had been disarmed of his most formidable weapon,\nbut he continued to fight. Larner felt the spikes on the monster's legs\ntear at his flesh.\n\n\"Don't kill the thing,\" he shouted. \"Bring on the net. For the love of\nGod bring on the net!\" Then he lost consciousness.\n\nIt was daylight when Larner, somewhat weakened from loss of blood,\nregained consciousness.\n\nThe beautiful Tula Bela was leaning over him.\n\nShe whispered comforting words to him in a language he did not fully\nunderstand. She whispered happy exclamations in words he did not know\nthe meaning of, but the tone was unmistakably those of a sweetheart\ntowards her lover.\n\nFinally, in answer to a true scientist's question in his eyes, she said\nin English:\n\n\"They caught the thing alive. They await your order to advance.\"\n\n\"Let us be on our way,\" said Larner, and he started to arise.\n\n\"You are hardly strong enough,\" said Tula.\n\n\"Believe me, I am all right,\" insisted Larner, and after several trials\nhe got to his feet. His constitution was naturally strong and his will\nwas stronger, so he fought back all feelings of weakness and soon\nannounced himself ready to go ahead with the project at hand. For speed\nwas all important, and the young professor found himself unable to\nremain inactive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rejoiced when Zorn told him that the big insect that had attacked\nTula Bela had been captured alive and had been kept well nourished by\nlat's blood injected into its stomach.\n\nWith Zorn Larner went to inspect the hideous monstrosity and found it in\nleash and straining. It was ready to be used to lead the way back to its\nbreeding place.\n\nIts wings shackled, the lumbering insect floundered on its way straight\nnorth. Ponderously and half blindly it crawled as the searchlights'\nglare was kept far enough in advance to keep from blinding the monster.\n\nTrue to instinct it finally brought up at early dawn under a high cliff\nof smoky quartz. Here, in the great crevices, the drove of diabolical\nvampires were hiding.\n\nAs the light struck their dens, they attempted clumsily to take wing,\nbut a interlacing network of devastating disintegrating rays from the\nray-guns shattered their bodies to dust, which was borne away by the\nwind.\n\nThe next few months were spent in combing the quartz crags of Venus for\nsimilar infested areas, but only the one breeding nest was found. The\nscourge had been conquered in its first and only stronghold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo ended the greatest reign of terror in the history of Venus.\n\nLeslie Larner was given a vote of thanks, and riches were showered upon\nhim by the good people of the sky's brightest star.\n\nHis modesty was characteristic, and he insisted that his part in saving\nhumanity on the planet had been small.\n\nPassage back to earth was offered him, but Nern and Tula Bela urged him\nto say and live his life on Venus. This he finally agreed to do.\n\n\"If I returned,\" he said, \"I would always be tempted to tell my\nexperiences while away, and there is not a jury in the world which would\naccount me sane after I had once spoken.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat the story of Larner's adventure reached earth dwellers at all is\ndue to the fact that Nern Bela on a subsequent visit to the earth\nnarrated it to a Colorado quartz miner. This miner, a bronzed and\nbearded prospector for gold, stumbled on the targo in a mountain\nfastness, and there was nought to do but make him welcome and pledge him\nto secrecy.\n\nThe miner surveyed the crystal targo in rapt wonderment and said: \"And\nto think I am the only earth man who ever viewed such a craft!\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Nern Bela, \"there is one other.\" And then the stirring\nstory of Leslie Larner's life on Venus was told.\n\n\n\n\nSAFE FLYING IN FOGS\n\nThe outstanding development in aviation recently, and one of the most\nsignificant so far in aviation history was the \"blind\" flight of Lieut.\nJames H. Doolittle, daredevil of the Army Air Corps, at Mitchel Field,\nL. I., which led Harry P. Guggenheim, President of the Daniel Guggenheim\nFund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, Inc. to announce that the problem\nof fog-flying, one of aviation's greatest bugbears, had been solved at\nlast.\n\nThere has been \"blind flying\" done in the past but never before in the\nhistory of aviation has any pilot taken off, circled, crossed,\nre-crossed the field, then landed only a short distance away from his\nstarting point while flying under conditions resembling the densest fog,\nas Lieut. \"Jimmy\" Doolittle has done, in his Wright-motored \"Husky\"\ntraining-plane. It was something uncanny to contemplate.\n\nThe \"dense fog\" was produced artificially by the simple device of making\nthe cabin of the plane entirely light-proof. Once seated inside, the\nflyer, with his co-pilot, Lieut. Benjamin Kelsey, also of Mitchel Field,\nwere completely shut off from any view of the world outside. All they\nhad to depend on were three new flying instruments, developed during the\npast year in experiments conducted over the full-flight laboratory\nestablished by the Fund at Mitchel Field.\n\nThe chief factors contributing to the solution of the problem of blind\nflying consist of a new application of the visual radio beacon, the\ndevelopment of an improved instrument for indicating the longitudinal\nand lateral position of an airplane, a new directional gyroscope, and a\nsensitive barometric altimeter, so delicate as to measure the altitude\nof an airplane within a few feet of the ground.\n\nThus, instead of relying on the natural horizon for stability, Lieut.\nDoolittle uses an \"artificial horizon\" on the small instrument which\nindicates longitudinal and lateral position in relation to the ground at\nall time. He was able to locate the landing field by means of the\ndirection-finding long-distance radio beacon. In addition, another\nsmaller radio beacon had been installed, casting a beam fifteen to\ntwenty miles in either direction, which governs the immediate approach\nto the field.\n\nTo locate the landing field the pilot watches two vibrating reeds, tuned\nto the radio beacon, on a virtual radio receiver on his instrument\nboard. If he turns to the right or left of his course the right or left\nreed, respectively, begins doing a sort of St. Vitus dance. If the reeds\nare in equilibrium the pilot knows it is clear sailing straight to his\nfield.\n\nThe sensitive altimeter showed Lieut. Doolittle his altitude and made it\npossible for him to calculate his landing to a distance of within a few\nfeet from the ground.\n\nProbably the strangest device of all that Lieut. Doolittle has been\ncalled upon to test in Mr. Guggenheim's war against fog is a sort of\nheat cannon that goes forth to combat like a fire-breathing dragon of\nold. Like the enemies of the dragon, the fog is supposed to curl up and\ndie before the scorching breath of the \"hot air artillery\" although the\nfundamental principle behind the device is a great deal more scientific\nthan such an explanation sounds. It is, in brief, based on the known\nfact that fog forms only in a very narrow temperature zone which lies\nbetween the saturation and precipitation points of the atmosphere. If\nthe air grows a little colder the fog turns into rain and falls; if it\nis warmed very slightly the mist disappears and the air is once more\nnormally clear, although its humidity is very close to the maximum.\n\n\n\n\nBrigands of the Moon\n\n(The Book of Gregg Haljan)\n\nPART TWO OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\n[Illustration: _I turned back to look at the Planetara._]\n\n  Out of awful space tumbled the Space-ship _Planetara_ towards the\n  Moon, her officers _dead_, with bandits at her helm--and the\n  controls out of order!\n\n\nMy name, Gregg Haljan. My age, twenty-five years. My occupation, at the\ntime my narrative begins, in 2075, was third officer of the\nInterplanetary Space-ship _Planetara_.\n\nThus I introduce myself to you. For this is a continuation of the book\nof Gregg Haljan, and of necessity I am the chief actor therein. I shall\nrecapitulate very briefly what has happened so far:\n\nUnscrupulous Martian brigands were scheming for Johnny Grantline's\nsecret radium-ore treasure, dug out of the Moon and waiting there to be\npicked up by the _Planetara_ on her return trip from Mars.\n\nThe _Planetara_ left, bound for Mars, some ten days away. Suspicious\ninterplanetary passengers were aboard: Miko and Moa, a brother and a\nsister of Mars; Sir Arthur Coniston, a mysterious Englishman; Ob Hahn, a\nVenus mystic. And small, effeminate George Prince and his sister, Anita.\nLove, I think, was born instantly between Anita and me. I found all too\nsoon that Miko, the sinister giant from Mars, also desired her.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs we neared the Moon we received Grantline's secret message: \"Stop for\nore on your return voyage. Success beyond wildest hopes!\" But I soon\ndiscovered that an eavesdropper in an invisible cloak had overheard it!\n\nSoon afterwards Miko accidentally murdered a person identified as Anita\nPrince.\n\nThen, in the confusion that resulted, Miko struck his great blow. The\ncrew of the _Planetara_, secretly in his pay, rose up and killed the\ncaptain and all the officers but Snap Dean, the radio-helio operator,\nand myself.\n\nI was besieged in the chart-room. George Prince leaped in upon me--and\nput his arms around me. I looked at him closer--only to discover it was\nAnita, disguised as her brother! It was her brother, George, who had\nbeen killed! George had been in the brigands' confidence--thus Anita was\nable to spy for us.\n\nQuickly we plotted. I would surrender to her, Anita Prince, whom the\nbrigands thought was George Prince. Together we might possibly be able,\nwith Snap's help, to turn the tide, and reclaim the _Planetara_.\n\nI was taken to my stateroom and locked there until Miko the brigand\nleader should come to dispose of me. But I cared not what had\nhappened--Anita was alive!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n_The Brigand Leader_\n\n\nThe giant Miko stood confronting me. He slid my cubby door closed behind\nhim. He stood with his head towering close against my ceiling. His cloak\nwas discarded. In his leather clothes, and with his clanking\nsword-ornament, his aspect carried the swagger of a brigand of old. He\nwas bareheaded; the light from one of my tubes fell upon his grinning,\nleering gray face.\n\n\"So, Gregg Haljan? You have come to your senses at last. You do not wish\nme to write my name upon your chest? I would not have done that to Dean;\nhe forced me. Sit back.\"\n\nI had been on my bunk. I sank back at the gesture of his huge hairy arm.\nHis forearm was bare now; the sear of a burn on it was plain to be seen.\nHe remarked my gaze.\n\n\"True. You did that, Haljan, in Great-New York. But I bear you no\nmalice. I want to talk to you now.\"\n\nHe cast about for a seat, and took the little stool which stood by my\ndesk. His hand held a small cylinder of the Martian paralyzing ray; he\nrested it beside him on the desk.\n\n\"Now we can talk.\"\n\nI remained silent. Alert. Yet my thoughts were whirling. Anita was\nalive. Masquerading now as her brother. And, with the joy of it, came a\nshudder. Above everything, Miko must not know.\n\n\"A great adventure we are upon, Haljan.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy thoughts came back. Miko was talking with an assumption of friendly\ncomradeship. \"All is well--and we need you, as I have said before. I am\nno fool. I have been aware of everything that went on aboard this ship.\nYou, of all the officers, are most clever at the routine mathematics. Is\nthat so?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said.\n\n\"You are modest.\" He fumbled at a pocket of his jacket, produced a\nscroll-sheaf. I recognized it: Blackstone's figures; the calculation\nBlackstone roughly made of the elements of the asteroid we had passed.\n\n\"I am interested in these,\" Miko went on. \"I want you to verify them.\nAnd this.\" He held up another scroll. \"This is the calculation of our\npresent position. And our course. Hahn claims he is a navigator. We have\nset the ship's gravity plates--see, like this--\"\n\nHe handed me the scrolls; he watched me keenly as I glanced over them.\n\n\"Well?\" I said.\n\n\"You are sparing of words, Haljan. By the devils of the airways, I could\nmake you talk! But I want to be friendly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI handed him back the scrolls. I stood up; I was almost within reach of\nhis weapon, but with a sweep of his great arm he abruptly knocked me\nback to my bunk.\n\n\"You dare?\" Then he smiled. \"Let us not come to blows!\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. I returned his smile. In truth, physical violence could\nget me nothing in dealing with this fellow. I would have to try guile.\nAnd I saw now that his face was flushed and his eyes unnaturally bright.\nHe had been drinking alcolite; not enough to befuddle him--but enough to\nmake him triumphantly talkative.\n\n\"Hahn may not be much of a mathematician,\" I suggested. \"But there is\nyour Sir Arthur Coniston.\" I managed a sarcastic grin. \"Is that his\nname?\"\n\n\"Almost. Haljan, will you verify these figures?\"\n\n\"Yes. But why? Where are we going?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"You are afraid I will not tell you! Why should I not? This\ngreat adventure of mine is progressing perfectly. A tremendous stake,\nHaljan. A hundred millions of dollars in gold-leaf; there will be\nfabulous riches for us all, when that radium ore is sold for a hundred\nmillion in gold-leaf.\"\n\n\"But where are we going?\"\n\n\"To that asteroid,\" he said abruptly. \"I must get rid of these\npassengers. I am no murderer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith half a dozen killings in the recent fight this was hardly\nconvincing. But he was obviously wholly serious. He seemed to read my\nthoughts.\n\n\"I kill only when necessary. We will land upon the asteroid. A perfect\nplace to maroon the passengers. Is it not so? I will give them the\nnecessities of life. They will be able to signal. And in a month or so,\nwhen we are safely finished with our adventure, a police ship no doubt\nwill rescue them.\"\n\n\"And then, from the asteroid,\" I suggested, \"we are going--\"\n\n\"To the Moon, Haljan. What a clever guesser you are! Coniston and Hahn\nare calculating our course. But I have no great confidence in them. And\nso I want you.\"\n\n\"You have me.\"\n\n\"Yes. I have you. I would have killed you long ago--I am an impulsive\nfellow--but my sister restrained me.\"\n\nHe gazed at me slyly. \"Moa seems strangely to like you, Haljan.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I'm flattered.\"\n\n\"She still hopes I may really win you to join us,\" he went on.\n\"Gold-leaf is a wonderful thing; there would be plenty for you in this\naffair. And to be rich, and have the love of a woman like Moa....\"\n\nHe paused. I was trying cautiously to gauge him, to get from him all the\ninformation I could. I said, with another smile, \"That is premature, to\ntalk of Moa. I will help you chart your course. But this venture, as you\ncall it, is dangerous. A police-ship--\"\n\n\"There are not many,\" he declared. \"The chances of us encountering one\nis very slim.\" He grinned at me. \"You know that as well as I do. And we\nnow have those code pass-words--I forced Dean to tell me where he had\nhidden them. If we should be challenged, our pass-word answer will\nrelieve suspicion.\"\n\n\"The _Planetara_,\" I objected, \"being overdue at Ferrok-Shahn, will\ncause alarm. You'll have a covey of patrol-ships after you.\"\n\n\"That will be two weeks from now,\" he smiled. \"I have a ship of my own\nin Ferrok-Shahn. It lies there waiting now, manned and armed. I am\nhoping that, with Dean's help, we may be able to flash it a signal. It\nwill join us on the Moon. Fear not for the danger, Haljan. I have great\ninterests allied with me in this thing. Plenty of money. We have planned\ncarefully.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was idly fingering his cylinder; his gaze roved me as I sat docile on\nmy bunk. \"Did you think George Prince was a leader of this? A mere boy.\nI engaged him a year ago--his knowledge of ores is valuable.\"\n\nMy heart was pounding, but I strove not to show it. He went on calmly.\n\n\"I told you I am impulsive. Half a dozen times I have nearly killed\nGeorge Prince, and he knows it.\" He frowned. \"I wish I had killed him,\ninstead of his sister. That was an error.\"\n\nThere was a note of real concern in his voice. Did he love Anita Prince?\nIt seemed so.\n\nHe added, \"That is done--nothing can change it. George Prince is helpful\nto me. Your friend Dean is another. I had trouble with him, but he is\ndocile now.\"\n\nI said abruptly, \"I don't know whether your promise means anything or\nnot, Miko. But George Prince said you would use no more torture.\"\n\n\"I won't. Not if you and Dean obey me.\"\n\n\"You tell Dean I have agreed to that. You say he gave you the code-words\nwe took from Johnson?\"\n\n\"Yes. There was a fool! That Johnson! You blame me, Haljan, for the\nkilling of Captain Carter? You need not. Johnson offered to try and\ncapture you. Take you alive. He killed Carter because he was angry at\nhim. A stupid, vengeful fool! He is dead, and I am glad of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mind was on Miko's plans. I ventured. \"This treasure on the Moon--did\nyou say it was on the Moon?\"\n\n\"Don't be an idiot,\" he retorted. \"I know as much about Grantline as you\ndo.\"\n\n\"That's very little.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know more, Miko. The Moon is a big place. Where, for\ninstance, is Grantline located?\"\n\nI held my breath. Would he tell me that? A score of questions--vague\nplans--were in my mind. How skilled at mathematics were these brigands?\nMiko, Hahn, Coniston--could I fool them? If I could learn Grantline's\nlocation on the Moon, and keep the _Planetara_ away from it. A pretended\nerror of charting. Time lost--and perhaps Snap could find an opportunity\nto signal Earth, get help.\n\nMiko answered my question as bluntly as I asked it. \"I don't know where\nGrantline is located. But we will find out. He will not suspect the\n_Planetara_. When we get close to the Moon, we will signal and ask him.\nWe can trick him into telling us. You think I do not know what is on\nyour mind, Haljan? There is a secret code of signals arranged between\nDean and Grantline. I have forced Dean to confess it. Without torture!\nPrince helped me in that. He persuaded Dean not to defy me. A very\npersuasive fellow, George Prince. More diplomatic than I am, I give him\ncredit.\"\n\nI strove to hold my voice calm. \"If I should join you, Miko--my word, if\nI ever gave it, you would find dependable--I would say George Prince is\nvery valuable to us. You should rein your temper. He is half your\nsize--you might some time, without intention do him injury.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe laughed. \"Moa says so. But have no fear--\"\n\n\"I was thinking,\" I persisted, \"I'd like to have a talk with George\nPrince.\"\n\nAh, my pounding, tumultuous heart! But I was smiling calmly. And I\ntried to put into my voice a shrewd note of cupidity. \"I really know\nvery little about this treasure, Miko. If there were a million or two of\ngold-leaf in it for me--\"\n\n\"Perhaps there would be.\"\n\n\"I was thinking. Suppose you let me have a talk with Prince? I have some\nknowledge of radium ores. His skill and mine--a calculation of what\nGrantline's treasure may really be. You don't know; you are only\nassuming.\"\n\nI paused. Whatever may have been in Miko's mind I cannot say. But\nabruptly he stood up. I had left my bunk, but he waved me back.\n\n\"Sit down. I am not like Moa. I would not trust you just because you\nprotested you would be loyal.\" He picked up his cylinder. \"We will talk\nagain.\" He gestured to the scrolls he had left upon my desk. \"Work on\nthose. I will judge you by the results.\"\n\nHe was no fool, this brigand leader.\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"You want a true course now to the asteroid?\"\n\n\"Yes. I will get rid of these passengers. Then we will plan further. Do\nyour best, Haljan--no error! By the Gods, I warn you I can check up on\nyou!\"\n\nI said meekly, \"Very well. But you ask Prince if he wants my\ncalculations of Grantline's ore-body.\"\n\nI shot Miko a foxy look as he stood by my door. I added, \"You think you\nare clever. There is plenty you don't know. Our first night out from the\nEarth--Grantline's signals--didn't it ever occur to you that I might\nhave some figures on his treasure?\"\n\nIt startled him. \"Where are they?\"\n\nI tapped my forehead. \"You don't suppose I was foolish enough to record\nthem. You ask Prince if he wants to talk to me. A high thorium content\nin ore--you ask Prince. A hundred millions, or two hundred. It would\nmake a big difference, Miko.\"\n\n\"I will think about it.\" He backed out and sealed the door upon me once\nagain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Anita did not come. I verified Hahn's figures, which were very\nnearly correct. I charted a course for the asteroid; it was almost the\none which had been set.\n\nConiston came for my results. \"I say, we are not so bad as navigators,\nare we? I think we're jolly good, considering our inexperience. Not bad\nat all, eh?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI did not think it wise to ask him about Prince.\n\n\"Are you hungry, Haljan?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA steward came with a meal. The saturnine Hahn stood at my door with a\nweapon upon me while I ate. They were taking no chances--and they were\nwise not to.\n\nThe day passed. Day and night, all the same of aspect here in the starry\nvault of Space. But with the ship's routine it was day.\n\nAnd then another time of sleep. I slept, fitfully, worrying, trying to\nplan. Within a few hours we would be nearing the asteroid.\n\nThe time of sleep was nearly passed. My chronometer marked five A. M. of\nour original Earth starting time. The seal of my cubby door hissed. The\ndoor slowly, opened.\n\nAnita!\n\nShe stood there with her cloak around her. A distance away on the\nshadowed deck-space Coniston was loitering.\n\n\"Anita!\" I whispered it.\n\n\"Gregg, dear!\"\n\nShe turned and gestured to the watching brigand. \"I will not be long,\nConiston.\"\n\nShe came in and half closed the door upon us, leaving it open enough so\nthat we could make sure that Coniston did not advance.\n\nI stepped back where he could not see us.\n\n\"Anita!\"\n\nShe flung herself into my opened arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n_The Masquerader_\n\n\nA moment when beyond all thought of the nearby brigand--or the\npossibility of an eavesdropping ray trained now upon my little cubby--a\nmoment while Anita and I held each other; and whispered those things\nwhich could mean nothing to the world, but which were all the world to\nus.\n\nThen it was she whose wits brought us back from the shining fairyland of\nour love, into the sinister reality of the _Planetara_.\n\n\"Gregg, if they are listening--\"\n\nI pushed her away. This brave little masquerader! Not for my life, or\nfor all the lives on the ship, would I consciously have endangered her.\n\n\"But the ore,\" I said aloud. \"There was, in Grantline's message--See\nhere, Prince.\"\n\nConiston was too far away on the deck to hear us. Anita went to my door\nagain and waved at him reassuringly. I put my ear to the door opening,\nand listened at the space across the grid of the ventilator over my\nbunk. The hum of a vibration would have been audible at those two\npoints. But there was nothing.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I whispered. \"Anita--not you who was killed! I can\nhardly realize it now. Not you whom they buried yesterday morning.\"\n\nWe stood and whispered, and she clung to me--so small beside me. With\nthe black robe thrown aside, it seemed that I could not miss the curves\nof her woman's figure. A dangerous game she was playing. Her hair had\nbeen cut short to the base of her neck, in the fashion of her dead\nbrother. Her eyelashes had been clipped; the line of her brows altered.\nAnd now, in the light of my ray tube as it shone upon her earnest face,\nI could remark other changes. Glutz, the little beauty specialist, was\nin this secret. With plastic skill he had altered the set of her jaw\nwith his wax--put masculinity there.\n\nShe was whispering: \"It was--was poor George whom Miko shot.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had now the true version of what had occurred. Miko had been forcing\nhis wooing upon Anita. George Prince was a weakling whose only good\nquality was a love for his sister. Some years ago he had fallen into\nevil ways. Been arrested, and then discharged from his position with the\nFederated Radium Corporation. He had taken up with evil companions in\nGreat-New York. Mostly Martians. And Miko had met him. His technical\nknowledge, his training with the Federated Corporation, made him\nvaluable to Miko's enterprise. And so Prince had joined the brigands.\n\nOf all this, Anita had been unaware. She had never liked Miko. Feared\nhim. And it seemed that the Martian had some hold upon her brother,\nwhich puzzled and frightened Anita.\n\nThen Miko had fallen in love with her. George had not liked it. And that\nnight on the _Planetara_, Miko had come and knocked upon Anita's door.\nIncautiously she opened it; he forced himself in. And when she repulsed\nhim, struggled with him, George had been awakened.\n\nShe was whispering to me now. \"My room was dark. We were all three\nstruggling. George was holding me--the shot came--and I screamed.\"\n\nAnd Miko had fled, not knowing whom his shot had hit in the darkness.\n\n\"And when George died, Captain Carter wanted me to impersonate him. We\nplanned it with Dr. Frank, to try and learn what Miko and the others\nwere doing. Because I never knew that poor George had fallen into such\nevil things.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could only hold her thankfully in my arms. The lost\nwhat-might-have-been seemed coming back to us.\n\n\"And they cut my hair, Gregg, and Glutz altered my face a little, and I\ndid my best. But there was no time--it came upon us so quickly.\"\n\nAnd she whispered, \"But I love you, Gregg. I want to be the first to say\nit: I love you--I love you.\"\n\nBut we had the sanity to try and plan.\n\n\"Anita, when you go back, tell Miko we discussed radium ores. You'll\nhave to be careful, clever. Don't say too much. Tell him we estimate the\ntreasure at a hundred and thirty millions.\"\n\nI told her what Miko had vouchsafed me of his plans. She knew all that.\nAnd Snap knew it. She had had a few moments alone with Snap. Gave me now\na message from him:\n\n\"We'll pull out of this, Gregg.\"\n\nWith Snap she had worked out a plan. There were Snap and I; and Shac and\nDud Ardley, upon whom we could doubtless depend. And Dr. Frank. Against\nus were Miko and his sister; and Coniston and Hahn. Of course there were\nthe members of the crew. But we were numerically the stronger when it\ncame to true leadership. Unarmed and guarded now. But if we could break\nloose--recapture the ship....\n\nI sat listening to Anita's eager whispers. It seemed feasible. Miko did\nnot altogether trust George Prince; Anita was now unarmed.\n\n\"But I can make opportunity! I can get one of their ray cylinders, and\nan invisible cloak equipment.\"\n\nThat cloak--it had been hidden in Miko's room when Carter searched for\nit in A20--was now in the chart-room by Johnson's body. It had been\nrepaired now; Anita thought she could get possession of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe worked out the details of the plan. Anita would arm herself, and come\nand release me. Together, with a paralyzing ray, we could creep aboard\nthe ship, overcome these brigands one by one. There were so few of the\nleaders. With them felled, and with us in control of the turret and the\nhelio-room we could force the crew to stay at their posts. There were,\nAnita said, no navigators among Miko's crew. They would not dare oppose\nus.\n\n\"But it should be done at once, Anita. In a few hours we will be at the\nasteroid.\"\n\n\"Yes. I will go now--try and get the weapons.\"\n\n\"Where is Snap?\"\n\n\"Still in the helio-room. One of the crew guards him.\"\n\nConiston was roaming the ship; he was still loitering on the deck,\nwatching our door. Hahn was in the turret. The morning watch of the crew\nwere at their posts in the hull-corridors; the stewards were preparing a\nmorning meal. There were nine members of subordinates altogether, Anita\nhad calculated. Six of them were in Miko's pay; the other three--our own\nmen who had not been killed in the fighting--had joined the brigands.\n\n\"And Dr. Frank, Anita?\"\n\nHe was in the lounge. All the passengers were herded there, with Miko\nand Moa alternating on guard.\n\n\"I will arrange it with Venza,\" Anita whispered swiftly. \"She will tell\nthe others. Dr. Frank knows about it now. He thinks it can be done.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe possibility of it swept me anew. The brigands were of necessity\nscattered singly about the ship. One by one, creeping under cover of an\ninvisible cloak, I could fell them, and replace them without alarming\nthe others. My thoughts leaped to it. We would strike down the guard in\nthe helio-room. Release Snap. At the turret we could assail Hahn, and\nreplace him with Snap.\n\nConiston's voice outside broke in upon us. \"Prince.\"\n\nHe was coming forward. Anita stood in the doorway. \"I have the figures,\nConiston. By God, this Haljan is with us! And clever! We think it will\ntotal a hundred and thirty millions. What a stake!\"\n\nShe whispered, \"Gregg, dear--I'll be back soon. We can do it--be ready.\"\n\n\"Anita--be careful of yourself! If they should suspect you....\"\n\n\"I'll be careful. In an hour, Gregg, or less, I'll come back. All right,\nConiston. Where is Miko? I want to see him. Stay where you are, Haljan!\nAll in good time Miko will trust you with your liberty. You'll be rich\nlike us all, never fear.\"\n\nShe swaggered out upon the deck, waved at the brigand, and banged my\ncubby door in my face.\n\nI sat upon my bunk. Waiting. Would she come back? Would she be\nsuccessful?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n_In the Blue-lit Corridor_\n\n\nShe came. I suppose it was no more than an hour: it seemed an eternity\nof apprehension. There was the slight hissing of the seal of my door.\nThe panel slid. I had leaped from my bunk where in the darkness I was\nlying tense.\n\n\"Prince?\" I did not dare say, \"Anita.\"\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nHer voice. My gaze swept the deck as the panel opened. Neither Coniston\nnor anyone else was in sight, save Anita's dark-robed figure which came\ninto my room.\n\n\"You got it?\" I asked her in a low whisper.\n\nI held her for an instant, kissed her. But she pushed me away with quick\nhands.\n\n\"Gregg, dear--\"\n\nShe was breathless. My kisses, and the tenseness of what lay before us\nwere to blame.\n\n\"Gregg, see, I have it. Give us a little light--we must hurry!\"\n\nIn the blue dimness I saw that she was holding one of the Martian\ncylinders. The smallest size; it would paralyze, but not kill.\n\n\"Only one, Anita?\"\n\n\"Yes. I had it before, but Miko took it from me. It was in his room. And\nthis--\"\n\nThe invisible cloak. We laid it on my grid, and I adjusted its\nmechanism. A cloak of the reflecting-absorbing variety.[A]\n\n\n  [A] The principle of this invisible cloak involves the use of an\n  electronized fabric. All color is absorbed. The light rays reflected to\n  the eye of the observer thus show an image of empty blackness. There is\n  also created about the cloak a magnetic field which by natural laws\n  bends the rays of light from objects behind it. This principle of the\n  natural bending of light when passing through a magnetic field was first\n  recognized by Albert Einstein, a scientist of the Twentieth century. In\n  the case of this invisible cloak, the bending light rays, by making\n  visible what was behind the cloak's blackness, thus destroyed its solid\n  black outline and gave a pseudo-invisibility which was fairly effective\n  under favorable conditions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI donned it, and drew its hood, and threw on its current.\n\n\"All right, Anita?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can you see me?\"\n\n\"No.\" She stepped back a foot or two further. \"Not from here. But you\nmust let no one approach too close.\"\n\nThen she came forward, put out her hand, fumbled until she found me.\n\nIt was our plan to have me follow her out. Anyone observing us would see\nonly the robed figure of the supposed George Prince, and I would escape\nnotice.\n\nThe situation about the ship was almost unchanged. Anita had secured the\nweapon and the cloak and slipped away to my cubby without being\nobserved.\n\n\"You're sure of that?\"\n\n\"I think so, Gregg. I was careful.\"\n\nMoa was now in the lounge, guarding the passengers. Hahn was asleep in\nthe chart-room; Coniston was in the turret. Coniston would be off duty\npresently, Anita said, with Hahn taking his place. There were look-outs\nin the forward and stern watch-towers, and a guard upon Snap in the\nhelio-room.\n\n\"Is he inside the room, Anita?\"\n\n\"Snap? Yes.\"\n\n\"No--the guard.\"\n\n\"No. He was sitting upon the spider bridge at the door.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was unfortunate. That guard could see all the deck clearly. He\nmight be suspicious of George Prince wandering around; it would be\ndifficult to get near enough to assail him. This cylinder, I knew, had\nan effective range of only some twenty feet.\n\nAnita and I were swiftly whispering. It was necessary now to decide\nexactly what we were to do; once under observation outside, there must\nbe no hesitation, no fumbling.\n\n\"Coniston is sharpest, Gregg. He will be the hardest to get near.\"\n\nThe languid-spoken Englishman was the one Anita most feared. His alert\neyes seemed to miss nothing. Perhaps he was suspicious of this George\nPrince--Anita thought so.\n\n\"But where is Miko?\" I whispered.\n\nThe brigand leader had gone below a few moments ago, down into the\nhull-corridor. Anita had seized the opportunity to come to me.\n\n\"We can attack Hahn in the chart-room first,\" I suggested. \"And get the\nother weapons. Are they still there?\"\n\n\"Yes. But Gregg, the forward deck is very bright.\"\n\nWe were approaching the asteroid. Already its light like a brilliant\nmoon was brightening the forward deck-space. It made me realize how much\nhaste was necessary.\n\nWe decided to go down into the hull-corridors. Locate Miko. Fell him,\nand hide him. His non-appearance back on deck would very soon throw the\nothers into confusion, especially now with our impending landing upon\nthe asteroid. And under cover of this confusion we would try and release\nSnap.\n\nWe had been arguing no more than a minute or two. We were ready. Anita\nslid my door wide. She stepped through, with me soundlessly scurrying\nafter her. The empty, silent deck was alternately dark with\nshadow-patches and bright with blobs of starlight. A sheen of the Sun's\ncorona was mingled with it; and from forward came the radiance of the\nasteroid's mellow silver glow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnita turned to seal my door; within my faintly humming cloak I stood\nbeside her. Was I invisible in this light? Almost directly over us,\nclose under the dome, the look-out sat in his little tower. He gazed\ndown at Anita.\n\nAmidships, high over the cabin superstructure, the helio-room hung dark\nand silent. The guard on its bridge was visible. He, too, looked down.\n\nA tense instant. Then I breathed again. There was no alarm. The two\nguards answered Anita's gesture.\n\nAnita said aloud into my empty cubby: \"Miko will come for you presently,\nHaljan. He told me to tell you that he wants you at the turret controls\nto land us on the asteroid.\"\n\nShe finished sealing my door and turned away; started forward along the\ndeck. I followed. My steps were soundless in my elastic-bottomed shoes.\nAnita swaggered with a noisy tread. Near the door of the smoking room a\nsmall incline passage led downward. We went into it.\n\nThe passage was dimly blue-lit. We descended its length, came to the\nmain corridor, which ran the length of the hull. A vaulted metal\npassage, with doors to the control rooms opening from it. Dim lights\nshowed at intervals.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe humming of the ship was more apparent here. It drowned the slight\nhumming of my cloak. I crept after Anita; my hand under the cloak\nclutched the ray weapon.\n\nA steward passed us. I shrank aside to avoid him.\n\nAnita spoke to him. \"Where is Miko, Ellis?\"\n\n\"In the ventilator-room, Mr. Prince. There was difficulty with the air\nrenewal.\"\n\nAnita nodded, and moved on. I could have felled that steward as he\npassed me. Oh, if I only had, how different things might have been!\n\nBut it seemed needless. I let him go, and he turned into a nearby door\nwhich led to the galley.\n\nAnita moved forward. If we could come upon Miko alone. Abruptly she\nturned, and whispered, \"Gregg, if other men are with him, I'll draw him\naway. You watch your chance.\"\n\nWhat little things may overthrow one's careful plans! Anita had not\nrealized how close to her I was following. And her turning so\nunexpectedly caused me to collide with her sharply.\n\n\"Oh!\" She exclaimed it involuntarily. Her outflung hand had unwittingly\ngripped my wrist, caught the electrode there. The touch burned her, and\nclose-circuited my robe. There was a hiss. My current burned out the\ntiny fuses.\n\nMy invisibility was gone! I stood, a tall black-hooded figure, revealed\nto the gaze of anyone who might be near!\n\nThe futile plans of humans! We had planned so carefully! Our\ncalculations, our hopes of what we could do, came clattering now in a\nsudden wreckage around us.\n\n\"Anita, run!\"\n\nIf I were seen with her, then her own disguise would probably be\ndiscovered. That above everything would be disaster!\n\n\"Anita, get away from me! I must try it alone!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could hide somewhere, repair the cloak perhaps. Or, since now I was\narmed, why could I not boldly start an assault?\n\n\"Gregg, we must get you back to your cubby!\" She was clinging to me in a\npanic.\n\n\"No! You run! Get away from me! Don't you understand? George Prince has\nno business here with me! They'd kill you!\"\n\nOr worse--- Miko would discover it was Anita, not George Prince.\n\n\"Gregg, let's get back to the deck.\"\n\nI pushed at her. Both of us in sudden confusion.\n\nFrom behind me there came a shout. That accursed steward! He had\nreturned, to investigate perhaps what George Prince was doing in this\ncorridor. He heard our voices; his shout in the silence of the ship\nsounded horribly loud. The white-clothed shape of him was in the nearby\ndoorway. He stood stricken in surprise at seeing me. And then turned to\nrun.\n\nI fired my paralyzing cylinder through my cloak. Got him! He fell. I\nshoved Anita violently.\n\n\"Run! Tell Miko to come--tell him you heard a shout! He won't suspect\nyou!\"\n\n\"But Gregg--\"\n\n\"You mustn't be found out! You're our only hope, Anita! I'll hide, fix\nthe cloak, or get back to my cubby. We'll try it again.\"\n\nIt decided her. She scurried down the corridor. I whirled the other way.\nThe steward's shout might not have been heard.\n\nThen realization flashed to me. That steward would be revived. He was\none of Miko's men: for two voyages he had been a spy upon the\n_Planetara_. He would be revived and tell what he had seen and heard.\nAnita's disguise would be revealed.\n\nA cold-blooded killing I do protest went against me. But it was\nnecessary. I flung myself upon him. I beat his skull with the metal of\nmy cylinder.\n\nI stood up. My hood had fallen back from my head. I wiped my bloody\nhands on my useless cloak. I had smashed the cylinder.\n\n\"Haljan!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnita's voice! A sharp note of horror and warning. I became aware that\nin the corridor, forty feet down its dim length, Miko had appeared, with\nAnita behind him. His rifle-bullet-projector was leveled. It spat at me.\nBut Anita had pulled at his arm.\n\nThe explosive report was sharply deafening in the confined space of the\ncorridor. With a spurt of flame the leaden pellet struck over my head\nagainst the vaulted ceiling.\n\nMiko was struggling with Anita. \"Prince, you idiot!\"\n\n\"Miko, don't! It's Haljan! Don't kill him--\"\n\nThe turmoil brought members of the crew. From the shadowed oval near me\nthey came running. I flung the useless cylinder at them. But I was\ntrapped in the narrow passage.\n\nI might have fought my way out. Or Miko might have shot me. But there\nwas the danger that, in her horror, Anita would betray herself.\n\nI backed against the wall. \"Don't kill me! See, I will not fight!\"\n\nI flung up my arms. And the crew, emboldened, and courageous under\nMiko's gaze, leaped on me and bore me down.\n\nThe futile plans of humans! Anita and I had planned so carefully, and in\na few brief minutes of action it had come only to this!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n_A Woman of Mars_\n\n\n\"So, Gregg Haljan, you are not as loyal as you pretend!\"\n\nMiko was livid with suppressed anger. They had stripped the cloak from\nme, and flung me back in my cubby. Miko was now confronting me; at the\ndoor Moa stood watching. And Anita was behind her. I sat outwardly\ndefiant and sullen on my bunk. But I was alert and tense, fearful still\nof what Anita's emotion might betray her into doing.\n\n\"Not so loyal,\" Miko repeated. \"And a fool! Do you think I am such a\nchild you can escape me!\"\n\nHe swung around. \"How did he get out of here? Prince, you came in here!\"\n\nMy heart was wildly thumping. But Anita retorted with a touch of spirit:\n\n\"I came to tell him what you commanded. To check Hahn's latest\nfigures--and to be ready to take the controls when we go into the\nasteroid's atmosphere.\"\n\n\"Well, how did he get out?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" she parried. Little actress! Her spirit helped to\nallay my fear. She held her cloak close around her in the fashion they\nhad come to expect from the George Prince who had just buried his\nsister. \"How should I know, Miko? I sealed his door.\"\n\n\"But did you?\"\n\n\"Of course he did,\" Moa put in.\n\n\"Ask your look-outs,\" said Anita. \"They saw me--I waved to them just as\nI sealed the door.\"\n\nI ventured, \"I have been taught to open doors.\" I managed a sly,\nlugubrious smile. \"I shall not try it again, Miko.\"\n\nNothing had been said about my killing of the steward. I thanked my\nconstellations now that he was dead. \"I shall not try it again,\" I\nrepeated.\n\nA glance passed between Miko and his sister. Miko said abruptly, \"You\nseem to realize that it is not my purpose to kill you. And you presume\nupon it.\"\n\n\"I shall not again.\" I eyed Moa. She was gazing at me steadily. She\nsaid, \"Leave me with him, Miko....\" She smiled. \"Gregg Haljan, we are no\nmore than twenty thousand miles from the asteroid now. The calculations\nfor retarding are now in operation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was what had taken Miko below, that and trouble with the ventilating\nsystem, which was soon rectified. But the retarding of the ship's\nvelocity when nearing a destination required accurate manipulation.\nThese brigands were fearful of their own skill. That was obvious. It\ngave me confidence. I was really needed. They would not harm me. Except\nfor Miko's impulsive temper, I was in no danger from them--not now,\ncertainly.\n\nMoa was saying, \"I think I may make you understand, Gregg. We have\ntremendous riches within our grasp.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" I added with sudden thought. \"But there are many with whom\nto divide this treasure....\"\n\nMiko caught my intended implication. \"By the infernal, this fellow may\nhave felt he could seize the treasure for himself! Because he is a\nnavigator!\"\n\nMoa said vehemently, \"Do not be an idiot, Gregg! You could not do it!\nThere will be fighting with Grantline.\"\n\nMy purpose was accomplished. They seemed to see me a willing outlaw like\nthemselves. As though it were a bond between us. And they could win me.\n\n\"Leave me with him,\" said Moa.\n\nMiko acquiesced. \"For a few minutes only.\" He proffered a heat-ray\ncylinder, but she refused it.\n\n\"I am not afraid of him.\"\n\nMiko swung on me. \"Within an hour we will be nearing the atmosphere.\nWill you take the controls?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe set his heavy jaw. His eyes bored into me. \"You're a strange fellow,\nHaljan. I can't make you out. I am not angry now. Do you think, when I\nam deadly serious, that I mean what I say?\"\n\nHis calm words set a sudden shiver over me. I checked my smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"Well then, I will tell you this: not for all of Prince's well-meaning\ninterference, or Moa's liking for you, or my own need of your skill,\nwill I tolerate more trouble from you. The next time--I will kill you.\nDo you believe me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is all I want to say. You kill my men, and my sister says I must\nnot hurt you. I am not a child to be ruled by a woman!\"\n\nHe held his huge fist before my face. \"With these fingers I will twist\nyour neck! Do you believe it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I did indeed.\n\nHe swung on his heel. \"If Moa wants to try and put sense into your\nhead--I hope she does. Bring him to the lounge when you are finished,\nMoa. Come, Prince--Hahn will need us.\" He chuckled grimly. \"Hahn seems\nto fear we will plunge into this asteroid like a wild comet gone\nsuddenly tangent!\"\n\nAnita moved aside to let him through the door. I caught a glimpse of her\nset white face as she followed him down the deck.\n\nThen Moa's bulk blocked the doorway. She faced me.\n\n\"Sit where you are, Gregg.\" She turned and closed the door upon us. \"I\nam not afraid of you. Should I be?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\nShe came and sat down beside me. \"If you should attempt to leave this\nroom, the stern look-out has orders to bore you through.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of leaving the room,\" I retorted. \"I do not want to\ncommit suicide.\"\n\n\"I thought you did. You seem minded in such a fashion. Gregg, why are\nyou so foolish?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI remained silent.\n\n\"Why?\" she demanded.\n\nI said carefully, \"This treasure--you are many who will divide it. You\nhave all these men on the _Planetara_. And in Ferrok-Shahn, others, no\ndoubt.\"\n\nI paused. Would she tell me? Could I make her talk of that other brigand\nship which Miko had said was waiting on Mars? I wondered if he had been\nable to signal it. The distance from here to Mars was great; yet upon\nother voyages Snap's signals had gotten through. My heart sank at the\nthought. Our situation here was desperate enough. The passengers soon\nwould be cast upon the asteroid: there would be left only Snap, Anita\nand myself. We might recapture the ship, but I doubted it now. My\nthoughts were turning to our arrival upon the Moon. We three might,\nperhaps, be able to thwart the attack upon Grantline, hold the brigands\noff until help from the Earth might come.\n\nBut with another brigand ship, fully manned and armed, coming from Mars,\nthe condition would be immeasurably worse. Grantline had some twenty\nmen, and his camp, I knew, would be reasonably fortified. I knew, too,\nthat Johnny Grantline would fight to his last man.\n\nMoa was saying, \"I would like to tell you our plans, Gregg.\"\n\nHer gaze was on my face. Keen eyes, but they were luminous now--an\nemotion in them sweeping her. But outwardly she was calm, stern-lipped.\n\n\"Well, why don't you tell me?\" I said. \"If I am to help you....\"\n\n\"Gregg, I want you with us. Don't you understand? We are not many. My\nbrother and I are guiding this affair. With your help, I would feel\ndifferently.\"\n\n\"The ship at Ferrok-Shahn--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy fears were realized. She said, \"I think our signals reached it. Dean\ntried, and Coniston was checking him.\"\n\n\"You think the ship is coming?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where will it join us?\"\n\n\"At the Moon. We will be there in thirty hours. Your figures gave that,\ndid they not, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes. And the other ship--how fast is it?\"\n\n\"Quite fast. In eight days--or nine, perhaps--it will reach the Moon.\"\n\nShe seemed willing enough to talk. There was indeed, no particular\nreason for reticence; I could not, she naturally felt, turn the\nknowledge to account.\n\n\"Manned--\" I prompted.\n\n\"About forty men.\"\n\n\"And armed? Long range projectors?\"\n\n\"You ask very avid questions, Gregg!\"\n\n\"Why should I not? Don't you suppose I'm interested?\" I touched her.\n\"Moa, did it ever occur to you, if once you and Miko trusted me--which\nyou don't--I might show more interest in joining you?\"\n\nThe look on her face emboldened me. \"Did you ever think of that, Moa?\nAnd some arrangement for my share of this treasure? I am not like\nJohnson, to be hired for a hundred pounds of gold-leaf.\"\n\n\"Gregg, I will see that you get your share. Riches, for you--and me.\"\n\n\"I was thinking, Moa, when we land at the Moon to-morrow--where is our\nequipment?\"\n\nThe Moon, with its lack of atmosphere, needed special equipment. I had\nnever heard Carter mention what apparatus the _Planetara_ was carrying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoa laughed. \"We have located air-suits and helmets--a variety of\nsuitable apparatus, Gregg. But we were not foolish enough to leave\nGreat-New York on this voyage without our own arrangements. My brother,\nand Coniston and Prince--all of us shipped crates of freight consigned\nto Ferrok-Shahn--and Rankin had special baggage marked 'theatrical\napparatus.'\"\n\nI understood it now. These brigands had boarded the _Planetara_ with\ntheir own Moon equipment, disguised as freight and personal baggage.\nShipped in bond, to be inspected by the tax officials of Mars.\n\n\"It is on board now. We will open it when we leave the asteroid, Gregg.\nWe are well equipped.\"\n\nShe bent toward me. And suddenly her long lean fingers were gripping my\nshoulders.\n\n\"Gregg, look at me!\"\n\nI gazed into her eyes. There was passion there; and her voice was\nsuddenly intense.\n\n\"Gregg, I told you once a Martian girl goes after what she wants. It is\nyou I want--\"\n\nNot for me to play like a cad upon a woman's emotions! \"Moa, you flatter\nme.\"\n\n\"I love you.\" She held me off, gazing at me. \"Gregg--\"\n\nI must have smiled. And abruptly she released me.\n\n\"So you think it amusing?\"\n\n\"No. But on Earth--\"\n\n\"We are not on the Earth. Nor am I of the Earth!\" She was gauging me\nkeenly. No note of pleading was in her voice; a stern authority; and the\npassion was swinging to anger.\n\n\"I am like my brother: I do not understand you, Gregg Haljan. Perhaps\nyou think you are clever? It seems stupidity, the fatuousness of man!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a moment of silence. \"Gregg, I said I loved you. Have you no\nanswer?\"\n\n\"No.\" In truth, I did not know what sort of answer it would be best to\nmake. Whatever she must have read in my eyes, it stirred her to fury.\nHer fingers with the strength of a man in them, dug into my shoulders.\nHer gaze searched me.\n\n\"You think you love someone else? Is that it?\"\n\nThat was horribly startling; but she did not mean it just that way. She\namended with caustic venom: \"That little Anita Prince! You thought you\nloved her! Was that it?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nBut I hardly deceived her. \"Sacred to her memory! Her ratlike little\nface--soft voice like a purring, sniveling cat! Is that what you're\nremembering, Gregg Haljan?\" she sneered.\n\nI tried to laugh. \"What nonsense!\"\n\n\"Is it? Then why are you cold under my touch? Am I--a girl descended\nfrom the Martian flame-workers--impotent now to awaken a man?\"\n\nA woman scorned! In all the Universe there could be no more dangerous an\nenemy. An incredible venom shot from her eyes.\n\n\"That miserable mouselike creature! Well for her that my brother killed\nher.\"\n\nIt struck me cold. If Anita was unmasked, beyond all the menace of\nMiko's wooing, I knew that the venom of Moa's jealousy was a greater\ndanger.\n\nI said sharply, \"Don't be simple, Moa!\" I shook off her grip. \"You\nimagine too much. You forget that I am a man of the Earth and you a girl\nof Mars.\"\n\n\"Is that reason why we should not love?\"\n\n\"No. But our instincts are different. Men of the Earth are born to the\nchase.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was smiling. With thought of Anita's danger I could find it readily in\nmy heart to dupe this Amazon.\n\n\"Give me time, Moa. You attract me.\"\n\n\"You lie!\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" I gripped her arm with all the power of my fingers.\nIt must have hurt her, but she gave no sign; her gaze clung to me\nsteadily.\n\n\"I don't know what to think, Gregg Haljan....\"\n\nI held my grip. \"Think what you like. Men of Earth have been known to\nkill the thing they love.\"\n\n\"You want me to fear you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nShe smiled scornfully. \"That is absurd.\"\n\nI released her. I said earnestly, \"I want you to realize that if you\ntreat me fairly, I can be of great advantage to this venture. There will\nbe fighting--I am fearless.\"\n\nHer venomous expression was softening. \"I think that is true, Gregg.\"\n\n\"And you need my navigating skill. Even now I should be in the turret.\"\n\nI stood up. I half expected she would stop me, but she did not. I added,\n\"Shall we go?\"\n\nShe stood beside me. Her height brought her face level with mine.\n\n\"I think you will cause no more trouble, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Of course not. I am not wholly witless.\"\n\n\"You have been.\"\n\n\"Well, that is over.\" I hesitated. Then I added, \"A man of Earth does\nnot yield to love when there is work to do. This treasure--\"\n\nI think that of everything I said, this last most convinced her.\n\nShe interrupted, \"That I understand.\" Her eyes were smoldering. \"When it\nis over--when we are rich--then I will claim you, Gregg.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe turned from me. \"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes. No! I must get that sheet of Hahn's last figures.\"\n\n\"Are they checked?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I picked the sheet up from my desk. \"Hahn is fairly accurate,\nMoa.\"\n\n\"A fool nevertheless. An apprehensive fool.\"\n\nA comradeship seemed coming between us. It was my purpose to establish\nit.\n\n\"Are we going to maroon Dr. Frank with the passengers?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But he may be of use to us.\" I wanted Dr. Frank kept aboard. I still\nfelt that there was a chance for us to recapture the ship.\n\nBut Moa shook her head decisively. \"My brother has decided not. We will\nbe well rid of Dr. Frank. Are you ready, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe opened the door. Her gesture reassured the look-out, who was alertly\nwatching the stern watch-tower.\n\n\"Come, Gregg.\"\n\nI stepped out, and followed her forward along the deck, which now was\nbright with the radiance of the nearby asteroid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n_Marooned on an Asteroid_\n\n\nA fair little world. I had thought so before; and I thought so now as I\ngazed at the asteroid hanging so close before our bow. A huge, thin\ncrescent, with the Sun off to one side behind it. A silver crescent,\ntinged with red. From this near viewpoint, all of the little globe's\ndisc was visible. The shadowed portion lay dimly red, mysteriously; the\nsunlit crescent--widening visibly is we approached--was gleaming silver.\nInky moonlike shadows in the hollows, brilliant light upon the mountain\nheights. The seas lay in gray patches. The convexity of the disc was\nsharply defined. So small a world! Fair and beautiful, shrouded with\nclouded areas.\n\n\"Where is Miko?\"\n\n\"In the lounge, Gregg.\"\n\n\"Can we stop there?\"\n\nMoa turned into the lounge archway. Strange, tense scene. I saw Anita at\nonce. Her robed figure lurked in an inconspicuous corner; her eyes were\nupon me as Moa and I entered, but she did not move. The thirty-odd\npassengers were huddled in a group. Solemn, white-faced men, frightened\nwomen. Some of them were sobbing. One Earth-woman--a young widow--sat\nholding her little girl, and wailing with uncontrolled hysteria. The\nchild knew me. As I appeared now, with my gold-laced white coat over my\nshoulders, the little child seemed to see in my uniform a mark of\nauthority. She left her mother and ran to me.\n\n\"You, please--you will help us? My moms is crying.\"\n\nI sent her gently back. But there came upon me then a compassion for\nthese innocent passengers, fated to have embarked upon this ill-starred\nvoyage. Herded here in this cabin, with brigands like pirates of old\nguarding them. Waiting now to be marooned on an uninhabited asteroid\nroaming in space. A sense of responsibility swept me. I swung upon Miko.\nHe stood with a nonchalant grace, lounging against the wall with a\ncylinder dangling in his hand. He anticipated me.\n\n\"So, Haljan--she put some sense into your head? No more trouble? Then\nget into the turret. Moa, stay there with him. Send Hahn here. Where is\nthat ass Coniston? We will be in the atmosphere shortly.\"\n\nI said, \"No more trouble from me, Miko. But these passengers--what\npreparation are you making for them on the asteroid?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stared in surprise. Then he laughed. \"I am no murderer. The crew is\npreparing food, all we can spare. And tools. They can build themselves\nshelter--they will be picked up in a few weeks.\"\n\nDr. Frank was here. I caught his gaze, but he did not speak. On the\nlounge couches there still lay the quarter-score bodies. Rankin, who\nhad been killed by Blackstone in the fight; a man passenger killed; a\nwoman and a man wounded.\n\nMiko added, \"Dr. Frank will take his medical supplies--he will care for\nthe wounded. There are other bodies among the crew.\" His gesture was\ndeprecating. \"I have not buried them. We will put them ashore; easier\nthat way.\"\n\nThe passengers were all eyeing me. I said:\n\n\"You have nothing to fear. I will guarantee you the best equipment we\ncan spare. You will give them apparatus with which to signal?\" I\ndemanded of Miko.\n\n\"Yes. Get to the turret.\"\n\nI turned away, with Moa after me. Again the little girl ran forward.\n\n\"Come--speak to my moms! She is crying.\"\n\nIt was across the cabin from Miko. Coniston had appeared from the deck;\nit created a slight diversion. He joined Miko.\n\n\"Wait,\" I said to Moa. \"She is afraid of you. This is humanity.\"\n\nI pushed Moa back. I followed the child. I had seen that Venza was\nsitting with the child's weeping mother. This was a ruse to get word\nwith me.\n\nI stood before the terrified woman while the little girl clung to my\nlegs.\n\nI said gently, \"Don't be so frightened. Dr. Frank will take care of you.\nThere is no danger--you will be safer on the asteroid than here on the\nship.\"\n\nI leaned down and touched her shoulder. \"There is no danger.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was between Venza and the open cabin. Venza whispered swiftly, \"When\nwe are landing, Gregg, I want you to make a commotion--anything--just as\nthe women passengers go ashore.\"\n\n\"Why? No, of course you will have food, Mrs. Francis.\"\n\n\"Never mind! An instant. Just confusion. Go, Gregg--don't speak now!\"\n\nI raised the child. \"You take care of mother.\" I kissed her.\n\nFrom across the cabin Miko's sardonic voice made me turn. \"Touching\nsentimentality, Haljan! Get to your post in the turret!\"\n\nHis rasping note of annoyance brooked no delay. I set the child down. I\nsaid, \"I will land us in an hour. Depend on it.\"\n\nHahn was at the controls when Moa and I reached the turret.\n\n\"You will land us safely, Haljan?\" he demanded anxiously.\n\nI pushed him away. \"Miko wants you in the lounge.\"\n\n\"You take command here?\"\n\n\"Of course, Hahn. I am no more anxious for a crash than you.\"\n\nHe sighed with relief. \"That is true. I am no expert at atmospheric\nentry, Haljan--nor Coniston, nor Miko.\"\n\n\"Have no fear. Sit down, Moa.\"\n\nI waved to the look-out in the forward watch-tower, and got his routine\ngesture. I rang the corridor bells, and the normal signals came promptly\nback.\n\n\"It's correct, Hahn. Get away with you.\" I called after him. \"Tell Miko\nthat things are all right here.\"\n\nHahn's small dark figure, lithe as a leopard in his tight fitting\ntrousers and jacket with his robe now discarded, went swiftly down the\nspider incline and across the deck.\n\n\"Moa, where is Snap? By the infernal, if he has been injured!--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp on the helio-room bridge the brigand guard still sat. Then I saw that\nSnap was out there sitting with him. I waved from the turret window, and\nSnap's cheery gesture answered me. His voice carried down through the\nsilver moonlight: \"Land us safely, Gregg. These weird amateur\nnavigators!\"\n\nWithin the hour I had us dropping into the asteroid's atmosphere. The\nship heated steadily. The pressure went up. It kept me busy with the\ninstruments and the calculations. But my signals were always promptly\nanswered from below. The brigand crew did its part efficiently.\n\nAt a hundred and fifty thousand feet I shifted the gravity plates to the\nlanding combinations, and started the electronic engines.\n\n\"All safe, Gregg?\" Moa sat at my elbow; her eyes, with what seemed a\nglow of admiration in them, followed my busy routine activities.\n\n\"Yes. The crew works well.\"\n\nThe electronic streams flowed out like a rocket tail behind us. The\n_Planetara_ caught their impetus. In the rarified air, our bow lifted\nslightly, like a ship riding a gentle ground swell. At a hundred\nthousand feet we sailed gently forward, hull down to the asteroid's\nsurface, cruising to seek a landing space.\n\nA little sea was now beneath us. A shadowed sea, deep purple in the\nnight down there. Occasional green-verdured islands showed, with the\nlines of white surf marking them. Beyond the sea, a curving coastline\nwas visible. Rocky headlines, behind which mountain foothills rose in\nserrated, verdured ranks. The sunlight edged the distant mountains; and\npresently this rapidly turning little world brought the sunlight\nforward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was day beneath us. We slid gently downward. Thirty thousand feet\nnow, above a sparkling blue ocean. The coastline was just ahead: green\nwith a lush, tropical vegetation. Giant trees, huge-leaved. Long\ndangling vines; air plants, with giant pods and vivid orchidlike\nblossoms.\n\nI sat at the turret window, staring through my glasses. A fair little\nworld, yet obviously uninhabited. I could fancy that all this was\nnewly-sprung vegetation. This asteroid had whirled in from the cold of\nthe interplanetary space far outside our Solar System. A few years\nago--as time might be measured astronomically, it was no more than\nyesterday--this fair landscape was congealed white and bleak, with a\nsweep of glacial ice. But the seeds of life miraculously were here. The\nmiracle of life! Under the warming, germinating sunlight, the verdure\nsprung.\n\n\"Can you find landing space, Gregg?\"\n\nMoa's question brought back my wandering fancies. I saw an upland glade,\na level spread of ferns with the forest banked around it. A cliff-height\nnearby, frowning down at the sea.\n\n\"Yes. I can land us there.\" I showed her through the glasses. I rang the\nsirens, and we spiraled, descending further. The mountain tops were now\nclose beneath us. Clouds were overhead, white masses with blue sky\nbehind them. A day of brilliant sunlight. But soon, with our forward\ncruising, it was night. The sunlight dropped beneath the sharply convex\nhorizon; the sea and the land went purple.\n\nA night of brilliant stars; the Earth was a blazing blue-red point of\nlight. The heavens visibly were revolving; in an hour or so it would be\ndaylight again.\n\nOn the forward deck now Coniston had appeared, commanding half a dozen\nof the crew. They were carrying up caskets of food and the equipment\nwhich was to be given the marooned passengers. And making ready the\ndisembarking incline, loosening the seals of the side-dome windows.\n\nSternward on the deck, by the lounge oval, I could see Miko standing.\nAnd occasionally the roar of his voice at the passengers sounded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy vagrant thought flung back into Earth's history. Like this, ancient\ntravelers of the surface of the sea were herded by pirates to walk the\nplank, or put ashore, marooned upon some fair desert island of the\ntropic Spanish main.\n\nHahn came mounting our turret incline. \"All is well, Gregg Haljan?\"\n\n\"Get to your work,\" Moa told him sharply. \"We land in an hour-quadrant.\"\n\nHe retreated, joining the bustle and confusion which now was beginning\non the deck. It struck me--could I turn that confusion to account? Would\nit be possible, now at the last moment, to attack these brigands? Snap\nstill sat outside the helio-room doorway. But his guard was alert, with\nupraised projector. And that guard, I saw, in his position high\namidships, commanded all the deck.\n\nAnd I saw too, as the passengers now were herded in a line from the\nlounge oval, that Miko had roped and bound all of the men. And a\nclanking chain connected them. They came like a line of convicts,\nmarching forward, and stopped on the open deck-space near the base of\nthe turret. Dr. Frank's grim face gazed up at me.\n\nMiko ordered the women and children in a group beside the chained men.\nHis words to them reached me: \"You are in no danger. When we land, be\ncareful. You will find gravity very different--this is a very small\nworld.\"\n\nI flung on the landing lights; the deck glowed with the blue radiance;\nthe search-beams shot down beside our hull. We hung now a thousand feet\nabove the forest glade. I cut off the electronic streams. We poised,\nwith the gravity-plates set at normal, and only a gentle night-breeze to\ngive us a slight side drift. This I could control with the lateral\npropeller rudders.\n\nFor all my busy landing routine, my mind was on other things. Venza's\nswift words back there in the lounge. I was to create a commotion while\nthe passengers were landing. Why? Had she and Dr. Frank, perhaps, some\nlast minute desperate purposes?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI determined I would do what she said. Shout, or mis-order the lights.\nThat would be easy. But to what advantage?\n\nI was glad it was night--I had, indeed, calculated our descent so that\nthe landing would be in darkness. But to what purpose? These brigands\nwere very alert. There was nothing I could think of to do which would\navail us anything more than a possible swift death under Miko's anger.\n\n\"Well done, Gregg!\" said Moa.\n\nI cut off the last of the propellers. With scarcely a perceptible jar,\nthe _Planetara_ grounded, rose like a feather and settled to rest in the\nglade. The deep purple night with stars overhead was around us. I hissed\nout our interior air through the dome and hull-ports, and admitted the\nnight-air of the asteroid. My calculations--of necessity mere\nmathematical approximations--proved fairly accurate. In temperature and\npressure there was no radical change as the dome-windows slid back.\n\nWe had landed. Whatever Venza's purpose, her moment was at hand. I was\ntense. But I was aware also, that beside me Moa was very alert. I had\nthought her unarmed. She was not. She sat back from me; in her hand was\na small thin knife-blade.\n\nShe murmured tensely, \"You have done your part, Gregg. Well and\nskillfully done. Now we will sit here quietly and watch them land.\"\n\nSnap's guard was standing, keenly watching. The look-outs in the forward\nand stern towers were also armed; I could see them both gazing keenly\ndown at the confusion of the blue-lit deck.\n\nThe incline went over the hull-side and touched the ground.\n\n\"Enough!\" Miko roared. \"The men first. Hahn, move the women back!\nConiston, pile those caskets to the side. Get out of the way, Prince.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnita was down there. I saw her at the edge of the group of women. Venza\nwas near her.\n\nMiko shoved her. \"Get out of the way, Prince. You can help Coniston.\nHave the things ready to throw off.\"\n\nFive of the steward-crew were at the head of the incline. Miko shouted\nup at me:\n\n\"Haljan, hold our shipboard gravity normal.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I responded.\n\nI had done so. Our magnitizers had been adjusted to the shifting\ncalculations of our landing. They were holding now at intensities, so\nthat upon the _Planetara_ no change from fairly normal Earth-gravity\nwas apparent. I rang a tentative inquiry signal; the operator in the\nhull-magnetizer control answered that he was at his post.\n\nThe line of men were first to descend. Dr. Frank led them. He flashed a\nlook of farewell up at me and Snap as he went down the incline with the\nchained men passengers after him.\n\nMotley procession! Twenty odd, dishevelled, half-clothed men of three\nworlds. The changing, lightening gravity on the incline caught them. Dr.\nFrank bounded up to the rail under the impetus of his step: caught and\nheld himself, drew himself back. The line swayed. In the dim, blue-lit\nglare it seemed unreal, crazy. A grotesque dream of men descending a\nplank.\n\nThey reached the forest glade. Stood swaying, afraid at first to move.\nThe purple night crowded them; they stood gazing at this strange world,\ntheir new prison.\n\n\"Now the women.\"\n\nMiko was shoving the women to the head of the incline. I could feel\nMoa's steady gaze upon me. Her knife-blade gleamed in the turret light.\n\nShe murmured again, \"In a few minutes you can ring us away, Gregg.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI felt like an actor awaiting his cue in the wings of some turgid drama\nthe plot of which he did not know. Venza was near the head of the\nincline. Some of the women and children were on it. A woman screamed.\nHer child had slipped from her hand, bounded up over the rail, and\nfallen. Hardly fallen--floated down to the ground, with flailing arms\nand legs, landing in the dark ferns, unharmed. Its terrified wail came\nup.\n\nThere was a confusion on the incline. Venza, still on the deck, seemed\nto send a look of appeal to the turret. My cue?\n\nI slid my hand to the light switchboard. It was near my knees. I pulled\na switch. The blue-lit deck beneath the turret went dark.\n\nI recall an instant of horrible, tense silence, and in the gloom beside\nme I was aware of Moa moving. I felt a thrill of instinctive fear--would\nshe plunge that knife into me?\n\nThe silence of the darkened deck was broken with a confusion of sounds.\nA babble of voices; a woman passenger's scream; shuffling of feet; and\nabove it all, Miko's roar:\n\n\"Stand quiet! Everyone! No movement!\"\n\nOn the descending incline there was chaos. The disembarking women were\nclinging to the gang-rail; some of them had evidently surged over it and\nfallen. Down on the ground in the purple-shadowed starlight I could\nvaguely see the chained line of men. They too were in confusion, trying\nto shove themselves toward the fallen women.\n\nMiko roared:\n\n\"Light those tubes! Gregg Haljan! By the Almighty, Moa, are you up\nthere? What is wrong? The light-tubes--\"\n\nDark drama of unknown plot! I wonder if I should try and leave the\nturret. Where was Anita? She had been down there on the deck when I\nflung out the lights.\n\nI think twenty seconds would have covered it all. I had not moved. I\nthought, \"Is Snap concerned with this?\"\n\nMoa's knife could have stabbed me. I felt her lunge against me; and\nsuddenly I was gripping her, twisting her wrist. But she flung the knife\naway. Her strength was almost the equal of my own. Her hand went for my\nthroat, and with the other hand she was fumbling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe deck abruptly sprang into light again. Moa had found the switch and\nthrew it back.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\nShe fought me as I tried to reach the switch. I saw down on the deck\nMiko gazing up at us. Moa panted, \"Gregg--stop! If he--sees you doing\nthis, he'll kill you--\"\n\nThe scene down there was almost unchanged. I had answered my cue. To\nwhat purpose? I saw Anita near Miko. The last of the women were on the\nplank.\n\nI had stopped struggling with Moa. She sat back, panting; and then she\ncalled: \"Sorry, Miko. It will not happen again.\"\n\nMiko was in a towering rage. But he was too busy to bother with me; his\nanger swung on those nearest him. He shoved the last of the women\nviolently at the incline. She bounded over. Her body, with the\ngravity-pull of only a few Earth-pounds, sailed in an arc and dropped to\nthe sward near the swaying line of men.\n\nMiko swung back. \"Get out of my way!\" A sweep of his huge arm knocked\nAnita sidewise. \"Prince, damn you, help me with those boxes!\"\n\nThe frightened stewards were lifting the boxes, square metal\nstorage-chests each as long as a man, packed with food, tools, and\nequipment.\n\n\"Here, get out of my way, all of you!\"\n\nMy breath came again; Anita nimbly retreated before Miko's angry rush.\nHe dashed at the stewards. Three of them held a box. He took it from\nthem; raised it at the top of the incline. Poised it over his head an\ninstant, with his massive arms like gray pillars beneath it. And flung\nit. The box catapulted, dropped; and then, passing the Planetara's\ngravity area, it sailed in a long flat arc over the forest glade and\ncrashed into the purple underbrush.\n\n\"Give me another!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stewards pushed another at him. Like an angry Titan, he flung it.\nAnd another. One by one the chests sailed out and crashed.\n\n\"There is your food--go pick it up! Haljan, make ready to ring us away!\"\n\nOn the deck lay the dead body of Rance Rankin, which the stewards had\ncarried out. Miko seized it, flung it.\n\n\"There! Go to your last resting place!\"\n\nAnd the other bodies. Balch Blackstone, Captain Carter, Johnson--Miko\nflung them. And the course masters and those of our crew who had been\nkilled; the stewards appeared with them; Miko unceremoniously cast them\noff.\n\nThe passengers were all on the ground now. It was dim down there. I\ntried to distinguish Venza, but could not. I could see Dr. Frank's\nfigure at the end of the chained line of men. The passengers were gazing\nin horror at the bodies hurtling over them.\n\n\"Ready, Haljan?\"\n\nMoa prompted me. \"Tell him yes!\"\n\nI called, \"Yes!\" Had Venza failed in her unknown purpose? It seemed so.\nOn the helio-room bridge Snap and his guard stood like silent statues in\nthe blue-lit gloom.\n\nThe disembarkation was over.\n\n\"Close the ports,\" Miko commanded.\n\nThe incline came folding up with a clatter. The port and dome-windows\nslid closed. Moa hissed against my ear:\n\n\"If you want life, Gregg Haljan, you will start your duties!\"\n\nVenza had failed. Whatever it was, it had come to nothing. Down in the\npurple forest, disconnected now from the ship, the last of our friends\nstood marooned. I could distinguish them through the blur of the closed\ndome--only a swaying, huddled group was visible. But my fancy pictured\nthis last sight of them--Dr. Frank, Venza, Shac and Dud Ardley.\n\nThey were gone. There were left only Snap, Anita, and myself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was mechanically ringing us away. I heard my sirens sounding down\nbelow, with the answering clangs here in the turret. The _Planetara's_\nrespiratory controls started; the pressure equalizers began operating,\nand the gravity plates shifted into lifting combinations.\n\nThe ship was hissing and quivering with it, combined with the grating of\nthe last of the dome ports. And Miko's command:\n\n\"Lift, Haljan.\"\n\nHahn had been mingled with the confusion of the deck, though I had\nhardly noticed him; Coniston had remained below, with the crew answering\nmy signals. Hahn stood now with Miko, gazing down through a deck window.\nAnita was alone at another.\n\n\"Lift, Haljan.\"\n\nI lifted us gently, bow first, with a repulsion of the bow plates. And\nstarted the central electronic engine. Its thrust from our stern moved\nus diagonally over the purple forest trees.\n\nThe glade slid downward and away. I caught a last vague glimpse of the\nhuddled group of marooned passengers, staring up at us. Left to their\nfate, alone on this deserted little world.\n\nWith the three engines going we slid smoothly upward. The forest\ndropped, a purple spread of tree-tops, edged with starlight and\nEarth-light. The sharply curving horizon seemed following us up. I swung\non all the power. We mounted at a forty degree angle, slowly circling,\nwith a bank of clouds over us to the side and the shining little sea\nbeneath.\n\n\"Very good, Gregg.\" In the turret light Moa's eyes blazed at me. \"I do\nnot know what you meant by darkening the deck-lights.\" Her fingers dug\nat my shoulders. \"I will tell my brother it was an error.\"\n\nI said, \"An error--yes.\"\n\n\"An error? I don't know what it was. But you have me to deal with now.\nYou understand? I will tell my brother so. You said, 'On Earth a man may\nkill the thing he loves.' A woman of Mars may do that! Beware of me,\nGregg Haljan.\"\n\nHer passion-filled eyes bored into me. Love? Hate? The venom of a woman\nscorned--a mingling of turgid emotions....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI twisted away from her grip and ignored her; she sat back, silently\nwatching my busy activities; the calculations of the shifting conditions\nof gravity, pressures, temperatures; a checking of the score or more of\ninstruments on the board before me.\n\nMechanical routine. My mind went to Venza, back there on the asteroid.\nThe wandering little world was already shrinking to a convex surface\nbeneath us. Venza, with her last unknown play, gone to failure. Had I\nfailed my cue? Whatever my part, it seemed now that I must have horribly\nmis-acted it.\n\nThe crescent Earth was presently swinging over our bow. We rocketed out\nof the asteroid's shadow. The glowing, flaming Sun appeared, making a\ncrescent of the Earth. With the glass I could see our tiny Moon,\nvisually seeming to hug the limb of its parent Earth.\n\nWe were away upon our course for the Moon. My mind flung ahead.\nGrantline with his treasure, unsuspecting this brigand ship. And\nsuddenly, beyond all thought of Grantline and his treasure, there came\nto me a fear for Anita. In God's truth I had been, so far, a very\nstumbling inept champion--doomed to failure with everything I tried. It\nswept me, so that I cursed my own incapacity. Why had I not contrived to\nhave Anita desert at the asteroid? Would it not have been far better for\nher there? Taking her chance for rescue with Dr. Frank, Venza and the\nothers?\n\nBut no! I had, like an inept fool, never thought of that! Had left her\nhere on board at the mercy of these outlaws.\n\nAnd I swore now that, beyond everything, I would protect her.\n\nFutile oath! If I could have seen ahead a few hours! But I sensed the\ncatastrophe. There was a shudder within me as I sat in that turret,\ndocilely guiding us out through the asteroid's atmosphere, heading us\nupon our course for the Moon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n_In the Zed-light Glow_\n\n\n\"Try again. By the infernal, Snap Dean, if you do anything to balk us!\"\n\nMiko scanned the apparatus with keen eyes. How much technical knowledge\nof signaling instruments did this brigand leader have? I was tense and\ncold with apprehension as I sat in a corner of the helio-room, watching\nSnap. Could Miko be fooled? Snap, I knew, was trying to fool him.\n\nThe Moon spread close beneath us. My log-chart, computed up to thirty\nminutes past, showed us barely some thirty thousand miles over the\nMoon's surface. The globe lay in quadrature beneath our bow quarter--a\nhuge quadrant spreading across the black starry vault of the lower\nheavens. A silver quadrant. The sunset caught the Lunar mountains, flung\nslanting shadows over the empty Lunar plains. All the disc was plainly\nvisible. The mellow Earth-light glowed serene and pale to illumine the\nLunar night.\n\nThe _Planetara_ was bathed in silver. A brilliant silver glare swept the\nforward deck, clean white and splashed with black shadows. We had partly\ncircled the Moon, so as now to approach it from the Earthward side. I\nhad worked with extreme concentration through the last few hours,\nplotting the trajectory of our curving sweep, setting the gravity plates\nwith constantly shifting combinations. And with it a necessity for the\nsteady retarding of our velocity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiko for a time was at my elbow in the turret. I had not seen Coniston\nand Hahn of recent hours. I had slept, awakened refreshed, and had a\nmeal. Coniston and Hahn remained below, one or the other of them always\nwith the crew to execute my sirened orders. Then Coniston came to take\nmy place in the turret, and I went with Miko to the helio-room.\n\n\"You are skilful, Haljan.\" A measure of grim approval was in Miko's\nvoice. \"You evidently have no wish to try and fool me in this\nnavigation.\"\n\nI had not, indeed. It is delicate work at best, coping with the\nintricacies of celestial mechanics upon a semicircular trajectory with\nretarding velocity, and with a make-shift crew we could easily have\ncome upon real difficulty.\n\nWe hung at last, hull-down, facing the Earthward hemisphere of the Lunar\ndisc. The giant ball of the Earth lay behind and above us--the Sun over\nour stern quarter. With forward velocity almost checked, we poised, and\nSnap began his signals to the unsuspecting Grantline.\n\nMy work momentarily was over. I sat watching the helio-room. Moa was\nhere, close beside me; I felt always her watchful gaze, so that even the\nplay of my expression needed reining.\n\nMiko worked with Snap. Anita too was here. To Miko and Moa it was the\nsomber, taciturn George Prince, shrouded always in his black mourning\ncloak, disinclined to talk; sitting alone, brooding and cowardly sullen.\n\nMiko repeated, \"By the infernal, if you try to fool me, Snap Dean!\"\n\nThe small metal room, with its grid floor and low-arched ceiling, glared\nwith moonlight through its windows. The moving figures of Snap and Miko\nwere aped by the grotesque, misshapen shadows of them on the walls. Miko\ngigantic--a great, menacing ogre. Snap small and alert--a trim, pale\nfigure in his tight-fitting white trousers, broad-flowing belt, and\nwhite shirt open at the throat. His face was pale and drawn from lack of\nsleep and the torture to which Miko had subjected him. But he grinned at\nthe brigand's words, and pushed his straggling hair closer under the red\neyeshade.\n\n\"I'm doing my best, Miko--you can believe it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe room over long periods was deadly silent, with Miko and Snap bending\nwatchfully at the crowded banks of instruments. A silence in which my\nown pounding heart seemed to echo. I did not dare look at Anita, nor she\nat me. Snap was trying to signal Earth, not the Moon! His main helios\nwere set in the reverse. The infra-red waves, flung from the bow\nwindow, were of a frequency which Snap and I believed that Grantline\ncould not pick up. And over against the wall, close beside me and\nseemingly ignored by Snap, there was a tiny ultra-violet sender. Its\nfaint hum and the quivering of its mirrors had so far passed unnoticed.\n\nWould some Earth-station pick it up? I prayed so. There was a thumb nail\nmirror here which could bring an answer. I prayed that it might swing.\n\nWould some Earth telescope be able to see us? I doubted it. The pinpoint\nof the _Planetara's_ infinitesimal bulk would be beyond them.\n\nLong silences, broken only by the faint hiss and murmur of Snap's\ninstruments.\n\n\"Shall I try the 'graphs, Miko?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI helped him with the spectroheliograph. At every level the plates\nshowed us nothing save the scarred and pitted Moon-surface. We worked\nfor an hour. There was nothing. Bleak cold night on the Moon here\nbeneath us. A touch of fading sunlight upon the Apennines. Up near the\nSouth Pole, Tycho with its radiating open rills stood like a grim dark\nmaw.\n\nMiko bent over a plate. \"Something here? Is there?\"\n\nAn abnormality upon the frowning ragged cliffs of Tycho? We thought so.\nBut then it seemed not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother hour. No signal came from Earth. If Snap's calls were getting\nthrough we had no evidence of it. Abruptly Miko strode at me from across\nthe room. I went cold and tense; Moa shifted, alert to my every\nmovement. But Miko was not interested in me. A sweep of his clenched\nfist knocked the ultra-violet sender and its coils and mirrors in a\ntinkling crash to the grid at my feet.\n\n\"We don't need that, whatever it is!\"\n\nHe rubbed his knuckles where the violet waves had tinged them, and\nturned grimly back to Snap.\n\n\"Where are your Gamma ray mirrors? If the treasure is exposed--\"\n\nThis Martian's knowledge was far greater than we believed. He grinned\nsardonically at Anita. \"If our treasure is on this hemisphere, Prince,\nwe should pick up Gamma rays? Don't you think so? Or is Grantline so\ncautious it will all be protected?\"\n\nAnita spoke in a careful, throaty drawl. \"The Gamma rays came plain\nenough when we passed here on the way out.\"\n\n\"You should know,\" grinned Miko. \"An expert eavesdropper, Prince--I will\nsay that for you. Come Dean, try something else. By God, if Grantline\ndoes not signal us, I will be likely to blame you--my patience is\nshortening. Shall we go closer, Haljan?\"\n\n\"I don't think it would help,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. \"Perhaps not. Are we checked?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" We were poised, very nearly motionless. \"If you wish an advance,\nI can ring it. But we need a surface destination now.\"\n\n\"True, Haljan.\" He stood thinking. \"Would a zed-ray penetrate those\ncrater-cliffs? Tycho, for instance, at this angle?\"[B]\n\n\"It might,\" Snap agreed. \"You think he may be on the Northern inner side\nof Tycho?\"\n\n\"He may be anywhere,\" said Miko shortly.\n\n\"If you think that,\" Snap persisted, \"suppose we swing the _Planetara_\nover the South Pole. Tycho, viewed from there--\"\n\n\"And take another quarter-day of time?\" Miko sneered. \"Flash on your\nzed-ray; help him hook it up, Haljan.\"\n\n\n  [B] An allusion to the use of the zed-ray light for making\n  spectro-photographs of what might be behind obscuring rock masses,\n  similar to the old-style X-ray.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI moved to the lens-box of the spectroheliograph. It seemed that Snap\nwas very strangely reluctant: Was it because he knew that the Grantline\ncamp lay concealed on the north inner wall of Tycho's giant ring? I\nthought so. But Snap flashed a queer look at Anita. She did not see it,\nbut I did. And I could not understand it.\n\nMy accursed, witless incapacity! If only I had taken warning!\n\n\"Here,\" commanded Miko. \"A score of 'graphs with the zed-ray. I tell you\nI will comb this surface if we have to stay here until our ship comes\nfrom Ferrok-Shahn to join us!\"\n\nThe Martian brigands were coming. Miko's signals had been answered. In\nten days the other brigand ship, adequately manned and armed, would be\nhere.\n\nSnap helped me connect the zed-ray. He did not dare even to whisper to\nme, with Moa hovering always so close. And for all Miko's sardonic\nsmiling, we knew that he would tolerate nothing from us now. He was\nfully armed, and so was Moa.\n\nI recall that Snap several times tried to touch me significantly. Oh, if\nonly I had taken warning!\n\nWe finished our connecting. The dull gray point of zed-ray gleamed\nthrough the prisms, to mingle with the moonlight entering the main lens.\nI stood with the shutter trip.\n\n\"The same interval, Snap?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBeside me, I was aware of a faint reflection of the zed-light--a gray\nCathedral shaft crossing the helio-room and falling upon the opposite\nwall. An unreality there, as the zed-light faintly strove to penetrate\nthe metal room-side.\n\nI said, \"Shall I make the exposure?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnap nodded. But that 'graph was never made. An exclamation from Moa\nmade us all turn. The Gamma mirrors were quivering! Grantline had picked\nour signals! With what undoubtedly was an intensified receiving\nequipment which Snap had not thought Grantline able to use, he had\ncaught our faint zed-rays, which Snap was sending only to deceive Miko.\nAnd Grantline had recognized the _Planetara_, and had released his\nocculting screens surrounding the radium ore. The Gamma rays were here,\nunmistakable!\n\nAnd upon their heels came Grantline's message. Not in the secret system\nhe had arranged with Snap, but unsuspectingly in open code. I could read\nthe swinging mirror, and so could Miko.\n\nAnd Miko decoded it triumphantly aloud:\n\n\"_Surprised but pleased your return. Approach Mid-Northern hemisphere,\nregion of Archimedes, forty thousand toises[C] off nearest Apennine\nrange._\"\n\nThe message broke off. But even its importance was overshadowed. Miko\nstood in the center of the helio-room, triumphantly reading the\nlight-indicator. Its beam swung on the scale, which chanced to be almost\ndirectly over Anita's head. I saw Miko's expression change. A look of\nsurprise, amazement came to him.\n\n\"Why--\"\n\nHe gasped. He stood staring. Almost stupidly staring for an instant. And\nas I regarded him with fascinated horror, there came upon his heavy gray\nface a look of dawning comprehension. And I heard Snap's startled intake\nof breath. He moved to the spectroheliograph, where the zed-ray\nconnections were still humming.\n\nBut with a leap Miko flung him away. \"Off with you! Moa, watch him!\nHaljan, don't move!\"\n\n\n  [C] About fifty miles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain Miko stood staring. Oh dear God, I saw now that he was staring at\nAnita!\n\n\"Why George Prince! How strange you look!\"\n\nAnita did not move. She was stricken with horror: she shrank back\nagainst the wall, huddled in her cloak. Miko's sardonic voice came\nagain:\n\n\"How strange you look. Prince!\" He took a step forward. He was grim and\ncalm. Horribly calm. Deliberate. Gloating--like a great gray monster in\nhuman form toying with a fascinated, imprisoned bird.\n\n\"Move just a little Prince. Let the zed-ray light fall more fully.\"\n\nAnita's head was bare. That pale, Hamletlike face. Dear God, the\nzed-light reflection lay gray and penetrating upon it!\n\nMiko took another step. Peering. Grinning. \"How amazing, George Prince!\nWhy, I can hardly believe it!\"\n\nMoa was armed with an electronic cylinder. For all her amazement--what\nturgid emotions sweeping her I can only guess--she never took her eyes\nfrom Snap and me.\n\n\"Back! Don't move, either of you!\" She hissed it at us.\n\nThen Miko leaped at Anita like giant gray leopard pouncing.\n\n\"Away with that cloak, Prince!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stood cold and numbed. And realization came at last. The faint\nzed-light glow had fallen by chance upon Anita's face. Penetrated the\nflesh; exposed, faintly glowing, the bone-line of her jaw. Unmasked the\nwaxen art of Glutz.\n\nAnd Miko had seen it.\n\n\"Why George, how surprising! Away with that cloak!\"\n\nHe seized her wrist, drew her forward, beyond the shaft of zed-light,\ninto the brilliant light of the Moon. And ripped her cloak from her. The\ngentle curves of her woman's figure were so unmistakable!\n\nAnd as Miko gazed at them, all his calm triumph swept away.\n\n\"Why, Anita!\"\n\nI heard Moa mutter: \"So that is it?\" A venomous flashing look--a shaft\nfrom me to Anita and back again. \"So that is it?\"\n\n\"Why, _Anita_!\"\n\nMiko's great arms gathered her up as though she were a child. \"So I have\nyou back; from the dead delivered back to me!\"\n\n\"Gregg!\" Snap's warning, and his grip over my shoulders brought me a\nmeasure of sanity. I had tensed to spring. I stood quivering, and Moa\nthrust her weapon against my face. The helio mirrors were swaying again\nwith another message from Grantline. But it came ignored by us all.\n\nIn the glare of moonlight by the forward window, Miko held Anita, his\ngreat hands pawing her with triumphant possessive caresses.\n\n\"So, little Anita, you are given back to me.\"\n\nAgainst her futile struggles he held her.\n\nDear God, if only I had had the wit to have prevented this!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n_The Grantline Camp_\n\n\nIn the mid-northern hemisphere upon the Earthward side of the Moon, the\ngiant crater of Archimedes stood brooding in silent majesty. Grim, lofty\nwalls, broken, pitted and scarred, rising precipitous to the upper\ncircular rim. Night had just fallen. The sunlight clung to the\ncrater-heights; it tinged with flame the jagged peaks of the Apennine\nMountains which rose in tiers at the horizon; and it flung great inky\nshadows over the intervening lowlands.\n\nNorthward, the Mare Imbrium stretched mysterious and purple, its million\nrills and ridges and crater holes flattened by distance and the\ngathering darkness into a seeming level surface. The night slowly\ndeepened. The dead-black vault of the sky blazed with its brilliant\nstarry gems. The gibbous Earth hung high above the horizon, motionless,\nsave for the invisible pendulum sway over the tiny arc, of its\nlibration: widening to quadrature, casting upon the bleak naked Lunar\nlandscape its mellow Earth-glow.\n\nSlow, measured process, this coming of the Lunar night! For an Earth-day\nthe sunset slowly faded on the Apennines; the poised Earth widened a\nlittle further--an Earth-day of time, with the Earth-disc visibly\nrotating, the faint tracery of its oceans and continents passing in\nslow, majestic review.\n\nAnother Earth-day interval. Then another. And another. Full night now\nenveloped Archimedes. Splotches of Earth-light and starlight sheen\nslowly shifted as the night advanced.\n\nBetween the great crater and the nearby mountains, the broken,\npseudo-level lowlands lay wan in the Earth-light. A few hundred miles,\nas distance would be measured upon Earth. A million million rills were\nhere. Valleys and ridges, ravines, sharp-walled canyons, cliffs and\ncrags--tiny craters like pock-marks.\n\nNaked, gray porous rock everywhere. This denuded landscape! Cracked and\nscarred and tumbled, as though some inexorable Titan torch had seared\nand crumbled and broken it, left it now congealed like a wind-lashed sea\nabruptly frozen into immobility.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoonlight upon Earth so gently shines to make romantic a lover's smile!\nBut the reality of the Lunar night is cold beyond human rationality.\nCold and darkly silent. Grim desolation. Awesome. Majestic. A frowning\nmajesty that even to the most intrepid human beholder is inconceivably\nforbidding.\n\nAnd there were humans here now. On this tumbled plain, between\nArchimedes and the mountains, one small crater amid the million of its\nfellows was distinguished this night by the presence of humans. The\nGrantline camp! It huddled in the deepest purple shadows on the side of\na bowl-like pit, a crudely circular orifice with a scant two miles\nacross its rippling rim. There was faint light here to mark the presence\nof the living intruders. The blue-glow radiance of Morrell tube-lights\nunder a spread of glassite.\n\nThe Grantline camp stood mid-way up one of the inner cliff-walls of the\nlittle crater. The broken, rock-strewn floor, two miles wide, lay five\nhundred feet below the camp. Behind it, the jagged precipitous cliff\nrose another five hundred to the heights of the upper rim. A broad\nlevel shelf hung midway up the cliff, and upon it Grantline had built\nhis little group of glassite dome shelters. Viewed from above there was\nthe darkly purple crater floor, the upflung circular rim where the\nEarth-light tinged the spires and crags with yellow sheen; and on the\nshelf, like a huddled group of birds nests, Grantline's domes clung and\ngazed down upon the inner valley.\n\nIntricate task, the building of these glassite shelters! There were\nthree. The main one stood close at the brink of the ledge. A quadrangle\nof glassite walls, a hundred feet in length by half as wide, and a scant\nten feet high to its flat-arched dome roof. Built for this purpose in\nGreat-New York, Grantline had brought his aluminite girders and braces\nand the glassite panels in sections.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe air here on the Moon surface was negligible--a scant one\nfive-thousandth of the atmospheric pressure at the sea-level on Earth.\nBut within the glassite shelter, a normal Earth-pressure must be\nmaintained. Rigidly braced double walls to withstand the explosive\ntendency, with no external pressure to counteract it. A tremendous\nnecessity for mechanical equipment had burdened Grantline's small\nship to its capacity. The chemistry of manufactured air, the\npressure equalizers, renewers, respirators, the lighting and\ntemperature-maintenance systems--all the mechanics of a space-flyer were\nhere.\n\nAnd within the glassite double walls, there was necessity for a constant\ncirculation of the Erentz temperature insulating system.[D]\n\nThere was this main Grantline building, stretching low and rectangular\nalong the front edge of the ledge. Within it were living rooms, messroom\nand kitchen. Fifty feet behind it, connected by a narrow passage of\nglassite, was a similar, though smaller structure. The mechanical\ncontrol rooms, with their humming, vibrating mechanisms were here. And\nan instrument room with signaling apparatus, senders, receivers,\nmirror-grids and audiphones of several varieties; and an\nelectro-telescope, small but modern, with dome overhead like a little\nEarth observatory.\n\nFrom this instrument building, beside the connecting pedestrian passage,\nwire cables for light, and air-tubes and strings and bundles of\ninstrument wires ran to the main structure--gray snakes upon the\nporous, gray Lunar rock.\n\nThe third building seemed a lean-to banked against the cliff-wall, a\nslanting shed-wall of glassite fifty feet high and two hundred in\nlength. Under it, for months Grantline's borers had dug into the cliff.\nBraced tunnels were here, penetrating back and downward into this vein\nof radio-active rock.\n\n\n  [D] An intricate system of insulation against extremes of temperature,\n  developed by the Erentz Kinetic Energy Corporation in the twenty-first\n  century. Within the hollow double shell of a shelter-wall, or an\n  explorer's helmet-suit, or a space-flyer's hull, an oscillating\n  semi-vacuum current was maintained--an extremely rarified air,\n  magnetically charged, and maintained in rapid oscillating motion. Across\n  this field the outer cold, or heat, as the case might be, could\n  penetrate only with slow radiation. This Erentz system gave the most\n  perfect temperature insulation known in its day. Without it,\n  interplanetary flight would have been impossible.\n\n  And it served a double purpose. Developed at first for temperature\n  insulation only, the Erentz system surprisingly brought to light one of\n  the most important discoveries made in the realm of physics of the\n  century. It was found that any flashing, oscillating current, whether\n  electronic, or the semi-vacuum of rarified air--or even a thin sheet of\n  whirling fluid--gave also a pressure-insulation. The kinetic energy of\n  the rapid movement was found to absorb within itself the latent energy\n  of the unequal pressure.\n\n  (The intricate postulates and mathematical formulae necessary to\n  demonstrate the operation of the physical laws involved would be out of\n  place here.)\n\n  The _Planetara_ was so equipped, against the explosive tendency of its\n  inner air-pressures when flying in the near-vacuum of space. In the case\n  of Grantline's glassite shelters, the latent energy of his room interior\n  air pressure went largely into a kinetic energy which in practical\n  effect resulted only in the slight acceleration of the vacuum current,\n  and thus never reached the outer wall. The Erentz engineers claimed for\n  their system a pressure absorption of 97.4%, leaving, in Grantline's\n  case, only 2.6% of room pressure to be held by the building's aluminite\n  bracers.\n\n  It may be interesting to note in this connection that without the Erentz\n  system as a basis, the great sub-sea developments on Earth and Mars of\n  the twenty-first century would also have been impossible. Equipped with\n  a fluid circulation device of the Erentz principle within its double\n  hull, the first submarine was able to penetrate the great ocean deeps,\n  withstanding the tremendous ocean pressures at depths of four thousand\n  fathoms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe work was over now. The borers had been dismantled and packed away.\nAt one end of the cliff the mining equipment lay piled in a litter.\nThere was a heap of discarded ore where Grantline had carted and dumped\nit after his first crude refining process had yielded it as waste. The\nore-slag lay like gray powder-flakes strewn down the cliff. Tracks and\nore-carts along the ledge stood discarded, mute evidence of the weeks\nand months of work these helmeted miners had undergone, struggling upon\nthis airless, frowning world.\n\nBut now all that was finished. The radio-active ore was sufficiently\nconcentrated. It lay--this treasure--in a seventy-foot pile behind the\nglassite lean-to, with a cage of wires over it and an insulation barrage\nguarding its Gamma rays from escaping to mark its presence.\n\nThe ore-shelter was dark; the other two buildings were lighted. And\nthere were small lights mounted at intervals about the camp and along\nthe edge of the ledge. A spider ladder, with tiny platforms some twenty\nfeet one above the other, hung precariously to the cliff-face. It\ndescended the five hundred feet to the crater floor; and, behind the\ncamp, it mounted the jagged cliff-face to the upper rim-height, where a\nsmall observatory platform was placed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch was the outer aspect of the Grantline Treasure Camp near the\nbeginning of this Lunar night, when, unbeknown to Grantline and his\nscore of men, the _Planetara_ with its brigands was approaching. The\nnight was perhaps a sixth advanced. Full night. No breath of cloud to\nmar the brilliant starry heavens. The quadrant Earth hung poised like a\ngiant mellow moon over Grantline's crater. A bright Earth, yet no air\nwas here on this Lunar surface to spread its light. Only a glow,\nmingling with the spots of blue tube-light on the poles along the cliff,\nand the radiance from the lighted buildings.\n\nThe crater floor was dimly purple. Beyond the opposite upper rim, from\nthe camp-height, the towering top of distant Archimedes was visible.\n\nNo evidence of movement showed about the silent camp. Then a pressure\ndoor in an end of the main building opened its tiny series of locks. A\nbent figure came out. The lock closed. The figure straightened and gazed\nabout the camp. Grotesque, bloated semblance of a man! Helmeted, with\nrounded dome-hood suggestion of an ancient sea diver, yet goggled and\ntrunked like a gas-masked fighter of the twentieth century war.\n\nHe stooped presently and disconnected metal weights which were upon his\nshoes.[E]\n\nThen he stood erect again, and with giant strides bounded along the\ncliff. Fantastic figure in the blue-lit gloom! A child's dream of crags\nand rocks and strange lights with a single monstrous figure in\nseven-league boots.\n\nHe went the length of the ledge with his twenty-foot strides, inspected\nthe lights, and made adjustments. Came back, and climbed with agile,\nbounding leaps up the spider ladder to the dome on the crater top. A\nlight flashed on up there. Then it was extinguished.\n\nThe goggled, bloated figure came leaping down after a moment.\nGrantline's exterior watchman making his rounds. He came back to the\nmain building. Fastened the weights on his shoes. Signaled within.\n\nThe lock opened. The figure went inside.\n\nIt was early evening, after the dinner hour and before the time of\nsleep, according to the camp routine Grantline was maintaining. Nine P.\nM. of Earth Eastern-American time, recorded now upon his Earth\nchronometer. In the living room of the main building Johnny Grantline\nsat with a dozen of his men dispersed about the room, whiling away as\nbest they could the lonesome hours.\n\n\n  [E] Within the Grantline buildings it was found more convenient to use a\n  gravity normal to Earth. This was maintained by the wearing of\n  metal-weighted shoes and metal-loaded belt. The Moon-gravity is normally\n  approximately one-sixth the gravity of Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All as usual. This cursed Moon! When I get home--if ever I do get\nhome--\"\n\n\"Say your say, Wilks. But you'll spend your share of the gold-leaf and\nthank your constellations that you had your chance!\"\n\n\"Let him alone! Come on, Wilks, take a hand here. This game is no good\nwith three.\"\n\nThe man who had been outside flung his hissing helmet recklessly to the\nfloor and unsealed his suit. \"Here, get me out of this. No, I won't\nplay. I can't play your cursed game with nothing at stake!\"\n\n\"Commissioner's orders.\"\n\nA laugh went up at the sharp look Johnny Grantline flung from where he\nsat reading in a corner of the room.\n\n\"Commander's orders. No gambling gold-leafers tolerated here.\"\n\n\"Play the game, Wilks.\" Grantline said quietly. \"We all know it's\ninfernal doing nothing.\"\n\n\"He's been struck by Earth-light,\" another man laughed. \"Commander, I\ntold you not to let that guy Wilks out at night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA rough but good-natured lot of men. Jolly and raucous by nature in\ntheir leisure hours. But there was too much leisure here now. Their\nmirth had a hollow sound. In older times, explorers of the frozen polar\nzones had to cope with inactivity, loneliness and despair. But at least\nthey were on their native world. The grimness of the Moon was eating\ninto the courage of Grantline's men. An unreality here. A weirdness.\nThese fantastic crags. The deadly silence. The nights, almost two weeks\nof Earth-time in length, congealed by the deadly frigidity of Space. The\ndays of black sky, blaring stars and flaming Sun, with no atmosphere to\ndiffuse the daylight. Days of weird blending sheen of illumination with\nmost of the Sun's heat radiating so swiftly from the naked Lunar surface\nthat the outer temperature still was cold. And day and night, always the\nfamiliar beloved Earth-disc hanging poised up near the zenith. From\nthinnest crescent to full Earth, and then steadily back again to\ncrescent.\n\nAll so abnormal, irrational, disturbing to human senses. With the mining\nwork over, an irritability grew upon Grantline's men. And perhaps since\nthe human mind is so wonderful, elusive a thing, there lay upon these\nmen an indefinable sense of impending disaster. Johnny Grantline felt\nit. He thought about it now as he sat in the room corner watching Wilks\nbeing forced into the plaget-game, and he found it strong within him.\nUnreasonable, ominous depression! Barring the accident which had\ndisabled his little space-ship when they reached this small crater hole,\nhis expedition had gone well. His instruments, and the information he\nhad from the former explorers, had picked up the ore-vein with a scant\nmonth of search.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vein had now been exhausted; but the treasure was here. Nothing was\nleft but to wait for the _Planetara_. The men were talking of that now.\n\n\"She ought to be well mid-way from here to Ferrok-Shahn by now. When do\nyou figure she'll be back here, and signal us?\"\n\n\"Twenty days. Give her another five now to Mars, and five in port.\nThat's ten. We'll pick her signals in three weeks, mark me.\"\n\n\"Three weeks! Just give me three weeks of reasonable sunrise and sunset!\nThis cursed Moon! You mean, Williams, next daylight.\"\n\n\"Hah! He's inventing a Lunar language. You'll be a Moon-man yet, if you\nlive here long enough.\"\n\nOlaf Swenson, the big blond fellow from the Scandia fiords, came and\nflung himself down by Grantline.\n\n\"Ay tank they bane without not enough to do, Commander. If the ore yust\nwould not give out--\"\n\n\"Three weeks--it isn't very long, Ollie.\"\n\n\"No. Maybe not.\"\n\nFrom across the room somebody was saying, \"If the _Comet_ hadn't smashed\non us, damn me but I'd ask the Commander to let some of us take her\nback. The discarded equipment could go.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Billy. She is smashed.\"\n\nThe little _Comet_, cruising in search of the ore, had come to grief\njust as the ore was found. It lay now on the crater floor with its nose\nbashed into an upflung spire of rock. Wrecked beyond repair. Save for\nthe pre-arrangement with the _Planetara_, the Grantline party would have\nbeen helpless here on the Moon. Knowledge of that--although no one ever\nsuspected but that the _Planetara_ would come safely--served to add to\nthe men's depression. They were cut off, virtually helpless on a strange\nworld. Their signalling devices were inadequate even to reach Earth.\nGrantline's power batteries were running low.[F] He could not attempt\nwide-flung signals without jeopardizing the power necessary for the\nroutine of his camp in the event of the _Planetara_ being delayed. Nor\nwas his electro-telescope adequate to pick small objects at any great\ndistance.[G]\n\nAll of Grantline's effort, in truth, had gone into equipment for the\nfinding and gathering of the treasure. The safety of the expedition had\nto that extent been neglected.\n\nSwenson was mentioning that now.\n\n\"You all agreed to it,\" Johnny said shortly. \"Every man here voted that,\nabove everything, what we wanted was to get the radium.\"\n\n\n  [F] The Gravely storage tanks--the power used by the Grantline\n  expedition--were heavy and bulky affairs. Economy of space on the Comet\n  allowed but few of them.\n\n  [G] Electro-telescopes of most modern use and power were too large and\n  used too much power to be available to Grantline.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA dynamic little fellow, this Johnny Grantline. Short of temper\nsometimes, but always just, and a perfect leader of men. In stature he\nwas almost as small as Snap. But he was thick-set, with a smooth shaven,\nkeen-eyed, square-jawed face, and a shock of brown tousled hair. A man\nof thirty-five, though the decision of his manner, the quiet dominance\nof his voice, mode him seem older. He stood up now, surveying the\nblue-lit glassite room with its low ceiling close overhead. He was\nbowlegged; in movement he seemed to roll with a stiff-legged gait like\nsome sea captain of former days on the deck of his swaying ship.\nQueer-looking figure! Heavy flannel shirt and trousers, boots heavily\nweighted, and bulky metal-loaded belt strapped about his waist.\n\nHe grinned at Swenson. \"When we divide this treasure, everyone will be\nhappy, Ollie.\"\n\nThe treasure was estimated by Grantline to be the equivalent of ninety\nmillions in gold-leaf. A hundred and ten millions in the gross as it now\nstood, with twenty millions to be deducted by the Federated Refiners for\nreducing it to the standard purity of commercial radium. Ninety\nmillions, with only a million and a half to come off for expedition\nexpenses, and the _Planetara_ Company's share another million. A nice\nlittle stake.\n\nGrantline strode across the room with his rolling gait.\n\n\"Cheer up, boys. Who's winning there? I say, you fellows--\"\n\nAn audiphone buzzer interrupted him, a call from the duty man in the\ninstrument room of the nearby building.\n\nGrantline clicked the receiver. The room fell into silence. Any call was\nunusual--nothing ever happened here in the camp.\n\nThe duty man's voice sounded over the room.\n\n\"Signals coming! Not clear. Will you come over, Commander?\"\n\nSignals!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was never Grantline's way to enforce needless discipline. He offered\nno objection when every man in the camp rushed through the connecting\npassages. They crowded the instrument room where the tense duty man sat\nbending over his helio receivers. The mirrors were swaying.\n\nThe duty man looked up and met Grantline's gaze.\n\n\"I ran it up to the highest intensity. Commander. We ought to get\nit--not let it pass.\"\n\n\"Low scale, Peter?\"\n\n\"Yes. Weakest infra-red. I'm bringing it up, even though it uses too\nmuch of our power.\" The duty man was apologetic.\n\n\"Get it,\" said Grantline shortly.\n\n\"I had a swing a minute ago. I think it's the _Planetara_.\"\n\n\"_Planetara!_\" The crowding group of men chorused it. How could it be\nthe _Planetara_?\n\nBut it was. The call presently came in clear. Unmistakably the\n_Planetara_, turned back now from her course to Ferrok-Shahn.\n\n\"How far away, Peter?\"\n\nThe duty man consulted the needles of his dial scale. \"Close! Very weak\ninfra-red. But close. Around thirty thousand miles, maybe. It's Snap\nDean calling.\"\n\nThe _Planetara_ here within thirty thousand miles! Excitement and\npleasure swept the room. The _Planetara's_ coming had for so long been\nawaited so eagerly!\n\nThe excitement communicated to Grantline. It was unlike him to be\nincautious; yet now with no thought save that some unforeseen and\npleasing circumstance had brought the _Planetara_ ahead of time;\nincautious Grantline certainly was.\n\n\"Raise the ore-barrage.\"\n\n\"I'll go! My suit is here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA willing volunteer rushed out to the ore-shed. The Gamma rays, which in\nthe helio-room of the _Planetara_ came so unwelcome to Snap and me, were\nloosed.\n\n\"Can you send, Peter?\" Grantline demanded.\n\n\"Yes, with more power.\"\n\n\"Use it.\"\n\nJohnny dictated the message of his location which we received. In his\nincautious excitement he ignored the secret code.\n\nAn interval passed. The ore was occulted again. No message had come from\nus--just Snap's routine signal in the weak infra-red, which we hoped\nGrantline would not get.\n\nThe men crowding Grantline's instrument room waited in tense silence.\nThen Grantline tried the telescope. Its current weakened the lights with\nthe drain upon the distributors, and cooled the room with a sudden\ndeadly chill as the Erentz insulating system slowed down.\n\nThe duty man looked suddenly frightened. \"You'll bulge out our walls,\nCommander. The internal pressure--\"\n\n\"We'll chance it.\"\n\nThey picked up the image of the _Planetara_! It came from the telescope\nand shone clear on the grid--the segment of star-field with a tiny,\ncigar-shaped blob. Clear enough to be unmistakable. The _Planetara_!\nHere now over the Moon, almost directly overhead, poised at what the\naltimeter scale showed to be a fraction under thirty thousand miles.\n\nThe men gazed in awed silence. The _Planetara_ coming....\n\nBut the altimeter needle was motionless. The _Planetara_ was hanging\npoised.\n\nA sudden gasp went about the room. The men stood with whitening faces,\ngazing at the _Planetara's_ image. And at the altimeter needle. It was\nmoving. The _Planetara_ was descending. But not with an orderly swoop.\n\nThe image showed the ship clearly. The bow tilted up, then dipped down.\nBut then in a moment it swung up again. The ship turned partly over.\nRighted itself. Then swayed again, drunkenly.\n\nThe watching men were stricken into horrified silence. The _Planetara's_\nimage momentarily, horribly, grew larger. Swaying. Then turning\ncompletely over, rotating slowly end over end.\n\nThe _Planetara_, out of control, was falling!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n_The Wreck of the_ Planetara\n\n\nOn the _Planetara_, in the helio-room, Snap and I stood with Moa's\nweapon upon us. Miko held Anita. Triumphant. Possessive. Then as she\nstruggled, a gentleness came to this strange Martian giant. Perhaps he\nreally loved her. Looking back on it, I sometimes think so.\n\n\"Anita, do not fear me.\" He held her away from him. \"I would not harm\nyou. I want your love.\" Irony came to him. \"And I thought I had killed\nyou! But it was only your brother.\"\n\nHe partly turned. I was aware of how alert was his attention. He\ngrinned. \"Hold them, Moa--don't let them do anything foolish. So, Anita,\nyou were masquerading to spy upon me? That was wrong of you.\" He was\nagain ironic.\n\nAnita had not spoken. She held herself tensely away from Miko; she had\nflashed me a look--just one. What horrible mischance to have brought\nthis catastrophe!\n\nThe completion of Grantline's message had come unnoticed by us all.\n\n\"Look! Grantline again!\" Snap said abruptly.\n\nBut the mirrors were steadying. We had no recording-tape apparatus; the\nrest of the message was lost. The mirrors pulsed and then steadied.\n\nNo further message came. There was an interval while Miko waited. He\nheld Anita in the hollow of his great arm.\n\n\"Quiet, little bird. Do not fear me. I have work to do, Anita--this is\nour great adventure. We will be rich, you and I. All the luxuries three\nworlds can offer, all for us when this is over. Careful, Moa! This\nHaljan has no wit.\"\n\nWell could he say it! I, who had been so witless to let this come upon\nus! Moa's weapon prodded me. Her voice hissed at me with all the venom\nof a reptile enraged. \"So that was your game, Gregg Haljan! And I was so\ngraceless to admit love for you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnap murmured in my ear, \"Don't move, Gregg! She's reckless.\"\n\nShe heard it. She whirled on him. \"We have lost George Prince, it seems.\nWell, we will survive without his ore knowledge. And you, Dean--and this\nHaljan--mark me, I will kill you both if you cause trouble!\"\n\nMiko was gloating. \"Don't kill them yet, Moa. What was it Grantline\nsaid? Near the crater of Archimedes? Ring us down, Haljan! We'll land.\"\n\nHe signaled the turret. Gave Coniston the Grantline message, and\naudiphoned it below to Hahn. The news spread about the ship. The bandits\nwere jubilant.\n\n\"We'll land now, Haljan. Ring us down. Come, Anita and I will go with\nyou to the turret.\"\n\nI found my voice. \"To what destination?\"\n\n\"Near Archimedes. The Apennine side. Keep well away from the Grantline\ncamp. We will probably sight it as we descend.\"\n\nThere was no trajectory needed. We were almost over Archimedes now. I\ncould drop us with a visible, instrumental course. My mind was whirling\nwith a confusion of thoughts. What could we do? What could we dare\nattempt to do? I met Snap's gaze.\n\n\"Ring us down, Gregg,\" he said quietly.\n\nI nodded. I pushed Moa's weapon away. \"You don't need that. I obey\norders.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe went to the turret. Moa watched me and Snap, a grim, cold Amazon. She\navoided looking at Anita, whom Miko helped down the ladders with a\nstrange mixture of courtierlike grace and amused irony. Coniston gazed\nat Anita with falling jaw.\n\n\"I say! Not George Prince? The girl--\"\n\n\"No time for argument now,\" Miko commanded. \"It's the girl, masquerading\nas her brother. Get below, Coniston. Haljan takes us down.\"\n\nThe astounded Englishman continued gazing at Anita. \"I mean to say,\nwhere to on the Moon? Not to encounter Grantline at once, Miko? Our\nequipment is not ready.\"\n\n\"Of course not. We will land well away. He won't be suspicious--we can\nsignal him again after we land. We will have time to plan, to assemble\nthe equipment. Get below, I told you.\"\n\nThe reluctant Coniston left us. I took the controls. Miko, still holding\nAnita as though she were a child, sat beside me. \"We will watch him,\nlittle Anita. A skilled fellow at this sort of work.\"\n\nI rang my signals for the shifting of the gravity plates. The answer\nshould have come from below within a second or two. But it did not. Miko\nregarded me with his great bushy eyebrows upraised.\n\n\"Ring again, Haljan.\"\n\nI duplicated. No answer. The silence was frightening. Ominous.\n\nMiko muttered, \"That accursed Hahn. Ring again!\"\n\nI sent the imperative emergency demand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo answer. A second or two. Then all of us in the turret were startled.\nTransfixed. From below came a sudden hiss. It sounded in the turret: it\ncame from shifting-room call-grid. The hissing of the pneumatic valves\nof the plate-shifters in the lower control room. The valves were\nopening; the plates automatically shifting into neutral, and\ndisconnecting!\n\nAn instant of startled silence. Miko may have realized the significance\nof what had happened. Certainly Snap and I did. The hissing ceased. I\ngripped the emergency plate-shifter switch which hung over my head. Its\ndisc was dead! The plates were dead in neutral. In the positions they\nwere only placed while in port! And their shifting mechanisms were\nimperative!\n\nI was on my feet. \"Snap! Good God, we're in neutral!\"\n\nMiko, if he had not realized it before, was aware if it now. The\nMoon-disc moved visibly as the _Planetara_ lurched. The vault of the\nheavens was slowly swinging.\n\nMiko ripped out a heavy oath. \"Haljan! What is this?\"\n\nHe stood up, still holding Anita. But there was nothing that he could do\nin this emergency. \"Haljan--what--\"\n\nThe heavens turned with a giant swoop. The Moon was over us. It swung in\ndizzying arc. Overhead, then back past our stern; under us, then\nappearing over our bow.\n\nThe _Planetara_ had turned over. Upending. Rotating, end over end.\n\nFor a moment or two I think all of us in that turret stood and clung.\nThe Moon-disc, the Earth, Sun and all the stars were swinging past our\nwindows. So horribly dizzying. The _Planetara_ seemed lurching and\ntumbling. But it was an optical effect only. I stared with grim\ndetermination at my feet. The turret seemed to steady.\n\nThen I looked again. That horrible swoop of all the heavens! And the\nMoon, as it went past, seemed expanded. We were falling! Out of control,\nwith the Moon-gravity pulling us inexorably down!\n\n\"That accursed Hahn--\" Miko, stricken with his lack of knowledge of\nthese controls, was wholly confused.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA moment only had passed. My fancy that the Moon-disc was enlarged was\nmerely the horror of my imagination. We had not fallen far enough yet\nfor that.\n\nBut we were falling. Unless I could do something, we would crash upon\nthe Lunar surface.\n\nAnita, killed in this _Planetara_ turret. The end of everything for us.\n\nAction came to me. I gasped, \"Miko, you stay here! The controls are\ndead! You stay here--hold Anita.\"\n\nI ignored Moa's weapon which she was still clutching mechanically. Snap\nthrust her away.\n\n\"Sit back! Let us alone! We're falling! Don't you understand?\"\n\nThis deadly danger, to level us all! No longer were we captors and\ncaptured. Not brigands for this moment. No thought of Grantline's\ntreasure! Trapped humans only! Leveled by the common, instinct of\nself-preservation. Trapped here together, fighting for our lives.\n\nMiko gasped. \"Can you--check us? What happened?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'll try.\"\n\nI stood clinging. This dizzying whirl! From the audiphone grid\nConiston's voice sounded.\n\n\"I say, Haljan, something's wrong! Hahn doesn't signal.\"\n\nThe look-out in the forward tower was clinging to his window. On the\ndeck below our turret a member of the crew appeared, stood lurching for\na moment, then shouted, and turned and ran, swaying, aimless. From the\nlower hull-corridors our grids sounded with the tramping of running\nsteps. Panic among the crew was spreading over the ship. A chaos below\ndecks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pulled at the emergency switch again. Dead....\n\nBut down below there was the manual controls.\n\n\"Snap, we must get down. The signals.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nConiston's voice came like a scream from the grid. \"Hahn is dead--the\ncontrols are broken! Hahn is dead!\"\n\nWe barely heard him. I shouted, \"Miko--hold Anita! Come on, Snap!\"\n\nWe clung to the ladders. Snap was behind me. \"Careful, Gregg! Good God!\"\n\nThis dizzying whirl. I tried not to look. The deck under me was now a\nblurred kaleidoscope of swinging patches of moonlight and shadow.\n\nWe reached the deck. Ran, swaying, lurching.\n\nIt seemed that from the turret Anita's voice followed us. \"Be careful!\"\n\nWithin the ship our senses steadied. With the rotating, reeling, heavens\nshut out, there were only the shouts and tramping steps of the\npanic-stricken crew to mark that anything was amiss. That, and a\npseudo-sensation of lurching caused by the pulsing of gravity--a pull\nwhen the Moon was beneath our hull to combine its force with our\nmagnetizers; a lightening when it was overhead. A throbbing, pendulum\nlurch--that was all.\n\nWe ran down to the corridor incline. A white-faced member of the crew,\ncame running up.\n\n\"What's happened? Haljan, what's happened?\"\n\n\"We're falling!\" I gripped him. \"Get below. Come on with us!\"\n\nBut he jerked away from me. \"Falling?\"\n\nA steward came running. \"Falling? My God!\"\n\nSnap swung at them. \"Get ahead of us! The manual controls--our only\nchance--we need all you men at the compressor pumps!\"\n\nBut it was an instinct to try and get on deck, as though here below we\nwere rats caught in a trap. The men tore away from me and ran. Their\nshouts of panic resounded through the dim, blue-lit corridors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConiston came lurching from the control room. \"I say--falling! Haljan,\nmy God, look at him!\"\n\nHahn was sprawled at the gravity-plate switchboard. Sprawled,\nhead-down. Dead. Killed by something? Or a suicide?\n\nI bent over him. His hands gripped the main switch. He had ripped it\nloose. And his left hand had reached and broken the fragile line of\ntubes that intensified the current of the pneumatic plate-shifters. A\nsuicide? With his last frenzy determined to kill us all?\n\nThen I saw that Hahn had been killed! Not a suicide! In his hand he\ngripped a small segment of black fabric, a piece torn from an invisible\ncloak? Was it?\n\nThe questions were swept away by the necessity for action. Snap was\nrigging the hand-compressors. If he could get the pressure back in the\ntanks....\n\nI swung on Coniston. \"You armed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He was white-faced and confused, but not in a panic. He showed me\nhis heat-ray cylinder. \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Round up the crew. Get all you can. Bring them here to man these\npumps.\"\n\nHe dashed away. Snap shouted after him. \"Kill them down if they argue!\"\n\nMiko's voice sounded from the turret call grid: \"Falling! Haljan, you\ncan see it now! Check us!\"\n\nI did not answer that. I pumped with Snap.\n\nDesperate moments. Or was it an hour? Coniston brought the men. He stood\nover them with menacing weapon.\n\nWe had all the pumps going. The pressure rose a little in the tanks.\nEnough to shift a bow-plate. I tried it. The plate slowly clicked into a\nnew combination. A gravity repulsion just in the bow-tip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI signaled Miko. \"Have we stopped swinging?\"\n\n\"No. But slower.\"\n\nI could feel it, that lurch of the gravity. But not steady now. A limp.\nThe tendency of our bow was to stay up.\n\n\"More pressure, Snap.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nOne of the crew rebelled, tried to bolt from the room. \"God, we'll\ncrash, caught in here!\"\n\nConiston shot him down.\n\nI shifted another bow-plate. Then two in the stern. The stern-plates\nseemed to move more readily than the others.\n\n\"Run all the stern-plates,\" Snap advised.\n\nI tried it. The lurching stopped. Miko called. \"We're bow down.\nFalling!\"\n\nBut not falling free. The Moon-gravity pull upon us was more than half\nneutralized.\n\n\"I'll go up, Snap, and try the engines. You don't mind staying down?\nExecuting my signals?\"\n\n\"You idiot!\" He gripped my shoulders. His eyes were gleaming, his face\nhaggard, but his pale lips twitched with a smile.\n\n\"Maybe it's good-by, Gregg. We'll fall--fighting.\"\n\n\"Yes. Fighting. Coniston, you keep the pressure up.\"\n\nWith the broken set-tubes it took nearly all the pressure to maintain\nthe few plates I had shifted. One slipped back to neutral. Then the\npumps gained on it, and it shifted again.\n\nI dashed up to the deck. Ah, the Moon was so close now! So horribly\nclose! The deck shadows were still. Through the forward bow windows the\nMoon surface glared up at us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI reached the turret. The _Planetara_ was steady. Pitched bow-down, half\nfalling, half sliding like a rocket downward. The scarred surface of the\nMoon spread wide under us.\n\nThese last horrible minutes were a blur. And there was always Anita's\nface. She left Miko. Faced with death, he sat clinging. Ignoring her,\nMoa, too, sat apart. Staring--\n\nAnd Anita crept to me. \"Gregg, dear one. The end....\"\n\nI tried the electronic engines from the stern, setting them in the\nreverse. The streams of their light glowed from the stern, forward\nalong our hull, and flared down from our bow toward the Lunar surface.\nBut no atmosphere was here to give resistance. Perhaps the electronic\nstreams checked our fall a little. The pumps gave us pressure, just in\nthe last minutes, to slide a few of the hull-plates. But our bow stayed\ndown. We slid, like a spent rocket falling.\n\nI recall the horror of that expanding Lunar surface. The maw of\nArchimedes yawning. A blob. Widening to a great pit. Then I saw it was\nto one side. Rushing upward.\n\nA phantasmagoria of uprushing crags. Black and gray. Spires tinged with\nEarth-light.\n\n\"Gregg, dear one--good-by.\"\n\nHer gentle arms around me. The end of everything for us. I recall\nmurmuring, \"Not falling free, Anita. Some hull-plates are set.\"\n\nMy dials showed another plate shifting, checking us a little further.\nGood old Snap.\n\nI calculated the next best plate to shift. I tried it. Slid it over.\nGood old Snap....\n\nThen everything faded but the feeling of Anita's arms around me.\n\n\"Gregg, dear one--\"\n\nThe end of everything for us....\n\nThere was an up-rush of gray-black rock.\n\nAn impact....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n_The Hiss of Death_\n\n\nI opened my eyes to a dark blur of confusion. My shoulder hurt--a pain\nshooting through it. Something lay like a weight on me. I could not seem\nto move my left arm. Very queer! Then I moved it, and it hurt. I was\nlying twisted: I sat up. And with a rush, memory came. The crash was\nover. I am not dead. Anita--\n\nShe was lying beside me. There was a little light here in this silent\nblur--a soft, mellow Earth-light filtering in the window. The weight on\nme was Anita. She lay sprawled, her head and shoulders half way across\nmy lap.\n\nNot dead! Thank God, not dead! She moved. Her arms went around me, and I\nlifted her. The Earth-light glowed on her pale face; but her eyes opened\nand she faintly smiled.\n\n\"It's past, Anita! We've struck, and we're still alive.\"\n\nI held her as though all life's turgid danger were powerless to touch\nus.\n\nBut in the silence my floating senses were brought back to reality by a\nfaint sound forcing itself upon me. A little hiss. The faintest\nmurmuring breath like a hiss. Escaping air!\n\nI cast off her clinging arms. \"Anita, this is madness!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor minutes we must have been lying there in the heaven of our embrace.\nBut air was escaping! The _Planetara's_ dome was broken--or cracked--and\nour precious air was hissing out.\n\nFull reality came to me at last. I was not seriously injured. I found\nthat I could move freely. I could stand. A twisted shoulder, a limp left\narm, but they were better in a moment.\n\nAnd Anita did not seem to be hurt. Blood was upon her. But not her\nblood.\n\nBeside Anita, stretched face down on the turret grid, was the giant\nfigure of Miko. The blood lay in a small pool against his face. A\nwidening pool.\n\nMoa was here. I thought her body twitched; then was still. This\nsoundless wreckage! In the dim glow of the wrecked turret with its two\nmotionless, broken human figures, it seemed as though Anita and I were\nghouls prowling. I saw that the turret had fallen over to the\n_Planetara's_ deck. It lay dashed against the dome-side.\n\nThe deck was aslant. A litter of wreckage. A broken human figure\nshowed--one of the crew, who at the last must have come running up. The\nforward observation tower was down on the chart-room roof: in its metal\ntangle I thought I could see the legs of the tower look-out.\n\nSo this was the end of the brigands' adventure! The _Planetara's_ last\nvoyage! How small and futile are human struggles! Miko's daring\nenterprise--so villainous, inhuman--brought all in a few moments to this\nsilent tragedy. The _Planetara_ had fallen thirty thousand miles. But\nwhy? What had happened to Hahn? And where was Coniston, down in this\nbroken hull?\n\nAnd Snap. I thought suddenly of Snap.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI clutched at my wandering wits. This inactivity was death. The escaping\nair hissed in my ears. Our precious air, escaping away into the vacant\ndesolation of the Lunar emptiness. Through one of the twisted, slanting\ndome-windows a rocky spire was visible. The _Planetara_ lay bow-down,\nwedged in a jagged cradle of Lunar rock. A miracle that the hull and\ndome had held together.\n\n\"Anita, we must get out of here!\"\n\nI thought I was fully alert now. I recalled that the brigands had spoken\nof having partly assembled their Moon equipment. If only we could find\nsuits and helmets!\n\n\"We must get out,\" I repeated. \"Get to Grantline's camp.\"\n\n\"Their helmets are in the forward storage room, Gregg. I saw them\nthere.\"\n\nShe was staring at the fallen Miko and Moa. She shuddered and turned\naway and gripped me. \"In the forward storage room, by the port of the\nemergency lock-exit.\"\n\nIf only the exit locks would operate! We must get out of here, but find\nSnap first. Good old Snap! Would we find him lying dead?\n\nWe climbed from the slanting, fallen turret, over the wreckage of the\nlittered deck. It was not difficult, a lightness was upon us. The\n_Planetara's_ gravity-magnetizers were dead: this was only the light\nMoon-gravity pulling us.\n\n\"Careful, Anita. Don't jump too freely.\"\n\nWe leaped along the deck. The hiss of the escaping pressure was like a\nclanging gong of warning to tell us to hurry. The hiss of death so\nclose!\n\n\"Snap--\" I murmured.\n\n\"Oh, Gregg. I pray we may find him alive--!\"\n\n\"And get out. We've got to rush it. Get out and find the Grantline\ncamp.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut how far? Which way? I must remember to take food and water. If the\nhelmets were equipped with admission ports. If we could find Snap. If\nthe exit locks would work to let us out.\n\nWith a fifteen foot leap we cleared a pile of broken deck chairs. A man\nlay groaning near them. I went back with a rush. Not Snap! A steward. He\nhad been a brigand, but he was a steward to me now.\n\n\"Get up! This is Haljan. Hurry, we must get out of here. The air is\nescaping!\"\n\nBut he sank back and lay still. No time to find if I could help him:\nthere were Anita and Snap to save.\n\nWe found a broken entrance to one of the descending passages. I flung\nthe debris aside and cleared it. Like a giant of strength with only this\nMoon-gravity holding me, I raised a broken segment of the superstructure\nand heaved it back.\n\nAnita and I dropped ourselves down the sloping passage. The interior of\nthe wrecked ship was silent and dim. An occasional passage light was\nstill burning. The passage and all the rooms lay askew. Wreckage\neverywhere: but the double-dome and hull-shell had withstood the shock.\nThen I realized that the Erentz system was slowing down. Our heat, like\nour air, was escaping, radiating away, a deadly chill settling upon\neverything. And our walls were bulging. The silence and the deadly chill\nof death would soon be here in these wrecked corridors. The end of the\n_Planetara_. I wondered vaguely if the walls would explode.\n\nWe prowled like ghouls. We did not see Coniston. Snap had been by the\nshifter-pumps. We found him in the oval doorway. He lay sprawled. Dead?\nNo, he moved. He sat up before we could get to him. He seemed confused,\nbut his senses clarified with the movement of our figures over him.\n\n\"Gregg! Why, Anita!\"\n\n\"Snap! You're all right? We struck--the air is escaping.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pushed me away. He tried to stand. \"I'm all right. I was up a minute\nago. Gregg, it's getting cold. Where is she? I had her here--she wasn't\nkilled. I spoke to her.\"\n\nIrrational!\n\n\"Snap!\" I held him, shook him. \"Snap, old fellow!\"\n\nHe said, normally. \"Easy, Gregg. I'm all right now.\"\n\nAnita gripped him. \"Who, Snap?\"\n\n\"She! There she is.\"\n\nAnother figure was here! On the grid-floor by the door oval. A figure\npartly shrouded in a broken invisible cloak and hood. An invisible\ncloak! I saw a white face with opened eyes regarding me. The face of a\ngirl.\n\nVenza!\n\nI bent down. \"You!\"\n\nAnita cried, \"Venza!\"\n\nVenza here? Why--how--my thoughts swept away. Venza here, dying? Her\neyes closed. But she murmured to Anita. \"Where is he? I want him.\"\n\nDying? I murmured impulsively, \"Here I am, Venza dear.\" Gently, as one\nwould speak with gentle sympathy to humor the dying. \"Here I am, Venza.\"\n\nBut it was only the confusion of the shock upon her. And it was upon us\nall. She pushed at Anita. \"I want him.\" She saw me. This whimsical Venus\ngirl! Even here as we gathered, all of us blurred by the shock, confused\nin the dim, wrecked ship with the chill of death coming--even here she\ncould make a jest. Her pale lips smiled.\n\n\"You, Gregg. I'm not hurt--I don't think I'm hurt.\" She managed to get\nherself up on one elbow. \"Did you think I wanted you with my dying\nbreath? Why, what conceit! Not you, Handsome Haljan! I was calling\nSnap.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was down to her. \"We're all right, Venza. It's over. We must get out\nof the ship--the air is escaping.\"\n\nWe gathered in the oval doorway. We fought the confusion of panic.\n\n\"The exit port is this way.\"\n\nOr was it? I answered Snap, \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\nThe ship suddenly seemed a stranger to me. So cold. So vibrationless.\nBroken lights. These slanting, wrecked corridors. With the ventilating\nfans stilled, the air was turning fetid. Chilling. And thinning, with\nescaping pressure, rarifying so that I could feel the grasp of it in my\nlungs and the pin-pricks of my burning cheeks.\n\nWe started off. Four of us, still alive in this silent ship of death. My\nblurred thoughts tried to cope with it all. Venza here. I recalled how\nshe had bade me create a diversion when the women passengers were\nlanding on the asteroid. She had carried out her purpose! In the\nconfusion she had not gone ashore. A stowaway here. She had secured the\ncloak. Prowling, to try and help us, she had come upon Hahn. Had seized\nhis ray-cylinder and struck him down, and been herself knocked\nunconscious by his dying lunge, which also had broken the tubes and\nwrecked the _Planetara_. And Venza, unconscious, had been lying here\nwith the mechanism of her cloak still operating, so that we did not see\nher when we came and found why Hahn did not answer my signals.\n\n\"It's here, Gregg.\"\n\nSnap and I lifted the pile of Moon equipment. We located four suits and\nhelmets and the mechanisms to operate them.\n\n\"More are in the chart-room,\" Anita said.\n\nBut we needed no others. I robed Anita, and showed her the mechanisms.\n\n\"Yes. I understand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnap was helping Venza. We were all stiff from the cold; but within the\nsuits and their pulsing currents, the blessed warmth came again.\n\nThe helmets had admission ports through which food and drink could be\ntaken. I stood with my helmet ready. Anita, Venza and Snap were bloated\nand grotesque beside me. We had found food and water here, assembled in\nportable cases which the brigands had prepared. Snap lifted them, and\nsigned to me he was ready.\n\nMy helmet shut out all sounds save my own breathing, my pounding heart,\nand the murmur of the mechanism. The blessed warmth and pure air were\ngood.\n\nWe reached the hull port-locks. They operated! We went through in the\nlight of the head-lamps over our foreheads.\n\nI closed the locks after us. An instinct to keep the air in the ship for\nthe other trapped humans lying there.\n\nWe slid down the sloping side of the _Planetara_. We were unweighted,\nirrationally agile with the slight gravity. I fell a dozen feet and\nlanded with barely a jar.\n\nWe were out on the Lunar surface. A great sloping ramp of crags\nstretched down before us. Gray-black rock tinged with Earth-light. The\nEarth hung amid the stars in the blackness overhead like a huge section\nof glowing yellow ball.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis grim, desolate, silent landscape! Beyond the ramp, fifty feet below\nus, a tumbled naked plain stretched away into blurred distance. But I\ncould see mountains off there. Behind us the towering, frowning\nrampart-wall of Archimedes loomed against the sky.\n\nI had turned to look back at the _Planetara_. She lay broken, wedged\nbetween spires of upstanding rock. A few of her lights still gleamed.\nThe end of the _Planetara_!\n\nThe three grotesque figures of Anita, Venza and Snap had started off.\nHunchback figures with the tanks mounted on their shoulders. I bounded\nand caught them. I touched Snap. We made audiphone contact.\n\n\"Which way do you think?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I think this way, down the ramp. Away from Archimedes, toward the\nmountains. It shouldn't be too far.\"\n\n\"You run with Venza. I'll hold Anita.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"But we must keep together, Gregg.\"\n\nWe could soon run freely. Down the ramp, out over the tumbled plain.\nBounding, grotesque leaping strides. The girls were more agile, more\nskilful. They were soon leading us. The Earth-shadows of their figures\nleaped beside them. The _Planetara_ faded into the distance behind us.\nArchimedes stood back there. Ahead, the mountains came closer.\n\nAn hour perhaps. I lost count of time. Occasionally we stopped to rest.\nWere we going toward the Grantline camp? Would they see our tiny waving\nheadlights?\n\nAnother interval. Then far ahead of us on the ragged plain, lights\nshowed! Moving tiny spots of light! Headlights on helmeted figures!\n\nWe ran, monstrously leaping. A group of figures were off there.\nGrantline's party? Snap gripped me.\n\n\"Grantline! We're safe, Gregg! Safe!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe took his bulb-light from his helmet: we stood in a group while he\nwaved it. A semaphore signal.\n\n\"_Grantline?_\"\n\nAnd the answer came. \"_Yes. You, Dean?_\"\n\nTheir personal code. No doubt of this--it was Grantline, who had seen\nthe _Planetara_ fall and had come to help us.\n\nI stood then with my hand holding Anita. And I whispered, \"It's\nGrantline! We're safe, Anita, my darling!\"\n\nDeath had been so close! Those horrible last minutes on the _Planetara_\nhad shocked us, marked us.\n\nWe stood trembling. And Grantline and his men came bounding up.\n\nA helmeted figure touched me. I saw through the helmet-pane the visage\nof a stern-faced, square-jawed, youngish man.\n\n\"Grantline? Johnny Grantline?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his voice at my ear-grid. \"I'm Grantline. You're Haljan?\nGregg Haljan?\"\n\nThey crowded around us. Gripped us to hear our explanations.\n\nBrigands! It was amazing to Johnny Grantline. But the menace was over\nnow, over as soon as Grantline had realized its existence. As though the\nwreck of the _Planetara_ were foreordained by an all-wise Providence,\nthe brigands' adventure had come to tragedy.\n\nWe stood for a time discussing it. Then I drew apart, leaving Snap with\nGrantline. And Anita joined me. I held her arm so that we had audiphone\ncontact.\n\n\"Anita, mine.\"\n\n\"Gregg, dear one.\"\n\nMurmured nothings which mean so much to lovers!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs we stood in the fantastic gloom of the Lunar desolation, with the\nblessed Earth-light on us, I sent up a prayer of thankfulness. Not that\na hundred millions of treasure were saved. Not that the attack upon\nGrantline had been averted. But only that Anita was given back to me. In\nmoments of greatest emotion the human mind individualizes. To me, there\nwas only Anita.\n\nLife is very strange! The gate to the shining garden of our love seemed\nswinging wide to let us in. Yet I recall that a vague fear still lay on\nme. A premonition?\n\nI felt a touch on my arm. A bloated helmet visor was thrust near my own.\nI saw Snap's face peering at me.\n\n\"Grantline thinks we should return to the _Planetara_. Might find some\nof them alive.\"\n\nGrantline touched me. \"It's only humanity.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\nWe went back. Some ten of us--a line of grotesque figures bounding with\nslow, easy strides over the jagged, rock-strewn plain. Our lights danced\nbefore us.\n\nThe _Planetara_ came at last into view. My ship. Again that pang swept\nme as I saw her. This, her last resting place. She lay here in her open\ntomb, shattered, broken, unbreathing. The lights on her were\nextinguished. The Erentz system had ceased to pulse--the heart of the\ndying ship, for a while beating faintly, but now at rest.\n\nWe left the two girls with some of Grantline's men at the admission\nport. Snap, Grantline and I, with three others, went inside. There still\nseemed to be air, but not enough so that we dared remove our helmets.\n\nIt was dark inside the wrecked ship. The corridors were black; the hull\ncontrol-rooms were dimly illumined with Earth-light straggling through\nthe windows.\n\nThis littered tomb! Already cold and silent with death. We stumbled over\na fallen figure. A member of the crew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrantline straightened from examining him.\n\n\"Dead.\"\n\nEarth-light fell on the horrible face. Puffed flesh, bloated red from\nthe blood which had oozed from its pores in the thinning air. I looked\naway.\n\nWe prowled further. Hahn lay dead in the pump-room.\n\nThe body of Coniston should have been near here. We did not see it.\n\nWe climbed up to the slanting littered deck. The dome had not exploded,\nbut the air up here had almost all hissed away.\n\nAgain Grantline touched me. \"That the turret?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nNo wonder he asked! The wreckage was all so formless.\n\nWe climbed after Snap into the broken turret room. We passed the body of\nthat steward who just at the end had appealed to me and I had left\ndying. The legs of the forward look-out still poked grotesquely up from\nthe wreckage of the observatory tower where it lay smashed down against\nthe roof of the chart-room.\n\nWe shoved ourselves into the turret. What was this? No bodies here! The\ngiant Miko was gone! The pool of his blood lay congealed into a frozen\ndark splotch on the metal grid.\n\nAnd Moa was gone! They had not been dead. Had dragged themselves out of\nhere, fighting desperately for life. We would find them somewhere around\nhere.\n\nBut we did not. Nor Coniston. I recalled what Anita had said: other\nsuits and helmets had been here in the nearby chart-room. The brigands\nhad taken them, and food and water doubtless, and escaped from the ship,\nfollowing us through the lower admission ports only a few minutes after\nwe had gone out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe made careful search of the entire ship. Eight of the bodies which\nshould have been here were missing: Miko, Moa, Coniston, and five of the\nsteward-crew.\n\nWe did not find them outside. They were hiding near here, no doubt, more\nwilling to take their chances than to yield now to us. But how, in all\nthis Lunar desolation, could we hope to locate them?\n\n\"No use,\" said Grantline. \"Let them go. If they want death--well, they\ndeserve it.\"\n\nBut we were saved. Then, as I stood there, realization leaped at me.\nSaved? Were we not indeed fatuous fools?\n\nIn all these emotion-swept moments since we had encountered Grantline,\nmemory of that brigand ship coming from Mars had never once occurred to\nSnap or me!\n\nI told Grantline now. His eyes through the visor stared at me blankly.\n\n\"What!\"\n\nI told him again. It would be here in eight days. Fully manned and\narmed.\n\n\"But Haljan, we have almost no weapons! All my _Comet's_ space was taken\nwith mining equipment and the mechanisms for my camp. I can't signal\nEarth! I was depending on the _Planetara_!\"\n\nIt surged upon us. The brigand menace past? We were blindly\ncongratulating ourselves on our safety! But it would be eight days or\nmore before in distant Ferrok-Shahn the non-arrival of the _Planetara_\nwould cause any real comment. No one was searching for us--no one was\nworried over us.\n\nNo wonder the crafty Miko was willing to take his chances out here in\nthe Lunar wilds! His ship, his reinforcements, his weapons were coming\nrapidly!\n\nAnd we were helpless. Almost unarmed. Marooned here on the Moon with our\ntreasure!\n\n(_To be continued._)\n\n\n               +-------------------------------------+\n               |         ASTOUNDING STORIES          |\n               |       _Appears on Newsstands_       |\n               |  THE FIRST THURSDAY IN EACH MONTH.  |\n               +-------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\nThe Soul-Snatcher\n\n_By Tom Curry_\n\n[Illustration: _He began to twist and turn, as though torn by some\ninvisible force._]\n\n  From twenty miles away stabbed the \"atom-filtering\" rays to Allen\n  Baker in his cell in the death house.\n\n\nThe shrill voice of a woman stabbed the steady hum of the many machines\nin the great, semi-darkened laboratory. It was the onslaught of weak\nfemininity against the ebony shadow of Jared, the silent negro servant\nof Professor Ramsey Burr. Not many people were able to get to the famous\nman against his wishes; Jared obeyed orders implicitly and was generally\nan efficient barrier.\n\n\"I will see him, I will,\" screamed the middle-aged woman. \"I'm Mrs. Mary\nBaker, and he--he--it's his fault my son is going to die. His fault.\n_Professor! Professor Burr!_\"\n\nJared was unable to keep her quiet.\n\nComing in from the sunlight, her eyes were not yet accustomed to the\nstrange, subdued haze of the laboratory, an immense chamber crammed full\nof equipment, the vista of which seemed like an apartment in hell.\nBizarre shapes stood out from the mass of impedimenta, great stills\nwhich rose full two stories in height, dynamos, immense tubes of colored\nliquids, a hundred puzzles to the inexpert eye.\n\nThe small, plump figure of Mrs. Baker was very out of place in this\nsetting. Her voice was poignant, reedy. A look at her made it evident\nthat she was a conventional, good woman. She had soft, cloudy golden\neyes and a pathetic mouth, and she seemed on the point of tears.\n\n\"Madam, madam, de doctor is busy,\" whispered Jared, endeavoring to shoo\nher out of the laboratory with his polite hands. He was respectful, but\nfirm.\n\nShe refused to obey. She stopped when she was within a few feet of the\nactivity in the laboratory, and stared with fear and horror at the\ncenter of the room, and at its occupant, Professor Burr, whom she had\naddressed during her flurried entrance.\n\nThe professor's face, as he peered at her, seemed like a disembodied\nstare, for she could see only eyes behind a mask of lavender gray glass\neyeholes, with its flapping ends of dirty, gray-white cloth.\n\nShe drew in a deep breath--and gasped, for the pungent fumes, acrid and\npenetrating, of sulphuric and nitric acids, stabbed her lungs. It was\nlike the breath of hell, to fit the simile, and aptly Professor Burr\nseemed the devil himself, manipulating the infernal machines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nActing swiftly, the tall figure stepped over and threw two switches in a\nsingle, sweeping movement. The vermillion light which had lived in a\nlong row of tubes on a nearby bench abruptly ceased to writhe like so\nmany tongues of flame, and the embers of hell died out.\n\nThen the professor flooded the room in harsh gray-green light, and\nstopped the high-pitched, humming whine of his dynamos. A shadow picture\nwrithing on the wall, projected from a lead-glass barrel, disappeared\nsuddenly, the great color filters and other machines lost their\nsemblance of horrible life, and a regretful sigh seemed to come from the\nmetal creatures as they gave up the ghost.\n\nTo the woman, it had been entering the abode of fear. She could not\nrestrain her shudders. But she bravely confronted the tall figure of\nProfessor Burr, as he came forth to greet her.\n\nHe was extremely tall and attenuated, with a red, bony mask of a face\npointed at the chin by a sharp little goatee. Feathery blond hair,\nsilvered and awry, covered his great head.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Burr in a gentle, disarmingly quiet voice, \"your manner of\nentrance might have cost you your life. Luckily I was able to deflect\nthe rays from your person, else you might not now be able to voice your\ncomplaint--for such seems to be your purpose in coming here.\" He turned\nto Jared, who was standing close by. \"Very well, Jared. You may go.\nAfter this, it will be as well to throw the bolts, though in this case I\nam quite willing to see the visitor.\"\n\nJared slid away, leaving the plump little woman to confront the famous\nscientist.\n\nFor a moment, Mrs. Baker stared into the pale gray eyes, the pupils of\nwhich seemed black as coal by contrast. Some, his bitter enemies,\nclaimed that Professor Ramsey Burr looked cold and bleak as an iceberg,\nothers that he had a baleful glare. His mouth was grim and determined.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYet, with her woman's eyes, Mrs. Baker, looking at the professor's bony\nmask of a face, with the high-bridged, intrepid nose, the passionless\ngray eyes, thought that Ramsey Burr would be handsome, if a little less\ncadaverous and more human.\n\n\"The experiment which you ruined by your untimely entrance,\" continued\nthe professor, \"was not a safe one.\"\n\nHis long white hand waved toward the bunched apparatus, but to her to\nthe room seemed all glittering metal coils of snakelike wire, ruddy\ncopper, dull lead, and tubes of all shapes. Hell cauldrons of unknown\nchemicals seethed and slowly bubbled, beetle-black bakelite fixtures\nreflected the hideous light.\n\n\"Oh,\" she cried, clasping her hands as though she addressed him in\nprayer, \"forget your science, Professor Burr, and be a man. Help me.\nThree days from now my boy, my son, whom I love above all the world, is\nto die.\"\n\n\"Three days is a long time,\" said Professor Burr calmly. \"Do not lose\nhope: I have no intention of allowing your son, Allen Baker, to pay the\nprice for a deed of mine. I freely confess it was I who was responsible\nfor the death of--what was the person's name?--Smith, I believe.\"\n\n\"It was you who made Allen get poor Mr. Smith to agree to the\nexperiments which killed him, and which the world blamed on my son,\" she\nsaid. \"They called it the deed of a scientific fiend, Professor Burr,\nand perhaps they are right. But Allen is innocent.\"\n\n\"Be quiet,\" ordered Burr, raising his hand. \"Remember, madam, your son\nAllen is only a commonplace medical man, and while I taught him a little\nfrom my vast store of knowledge, he was ignorant and of much less value\nto science and humanity than myself. Do you not understand, can you not\ncomprehend, also, that the man Smith was a martyr to science? He was no\nloss to mankind, and only sentimentalists could have blamed anyone for\nhis death. I should have succeeded in the interchange of atoms which we\nwere working on, and Smith would at this moment be hailed as the first\nman to travel through space in invisible form, projected on radio waves,\nhad it not been for the fact that the alloy which conducts the three\ntypes of sinusoidal failed me and burned out. Yes, it was an error in\ncalculation, and Smith would now be called the Lindbergh of the Atom but\nfor that. Yet Smith has not died in vain, for I have finally corrected\nthis error--science is but trial and correction of error--and all will\nbe well.\"\n\n\"But Allen--Allen must not die at all!\" she cried. \"For weeks he has\nbeen in the death house: it is killing me. The Governor refuses him a\npardon, nor will he commute my son's sentence. In three days he is to\ndie in the electric chair, for a crime which you admit you alone are\nresponsible for. Yet you remain in your laboratory, immersed in your\nexperiments, and do nothing, nothing!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tears came now, and she sobbed hysterically. It seemed that she was\nmaking an appeal to someone in whom she had only a forlorn hope.\n\n\"Nothing?\" repeated Burr, pursing his thin lips. \"Nothing? Madam, I have\ndone everything. I have, as I have told you, perfected the experiment.\nIt is successful. Your son has not suffered in vain, and Smith's name\nwill go down with the rest of science's martyrs as one who died for the\nsake of humanity. But if you wish to save your son, you must be calm.\nYou must listen to what I have to say, and you must not fail to carry\nout my instructions to the letter. I am ready now.\"\n\nLight, the light of hope, sprang in the mother's eyes. She grasped his\narm and stared at him with shining face, through tear-dipped eyelashes.\n\n\"Do--do you mean it? Can you save him? After the Governor has refused\nme? What can you do? No influence will snatch Allen from the jaws of the\nlaw: the public is greatly excited and very hostile toward him.\"\n\nA quiet smile played at the corners of Burr's thin lips.\n\n\"Come,\" he said. \"Place this cloak about you. Allen wore it when he\nassisted me.\"\n\nThe professor replaced his own mask and conducted the woman into the\ninterior of the laboratory.\n\n\"I will show you,\" said Professor Burr.\n\nShe saw before her now, on long metal shelves which appeared to be\ndelicately poised on fine scales whose balance was registered by\nhair-line indicators, two small metal cages.\n\nProfessor Burr stepped over to a row of common cages set along the wall.\nThere was a small menagerie there, guinea pigs--the martyrs of the\nanimal kingdom--rabbits, monkeys, and some cats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man of science reached in and dragged out a mewing cat, placing it\nin the right-hand cage on the strange table. He then obtained a small\nmonkey and put this animal in the left-hand cage, beside the cat. The\ncat, on the right, squatted on its haunches, mewing in pique and looking\nup at its tormentor. The monkey, after a quick look around, began to\ninvestigate the upper reaches of its new cage.\n\nOver each of the animals was suspended a fine, curious metallic\narmament. For several minutes, while the woman, puzzled at how this\ndemonstration was to affect the rescue of her condemned son, waited\nimpatiently, the professor deftly worked at the apparatus, connecting\nwires here and there.\n\n\"I am ready now,\" said Burr. \"Watch the two animals carefully.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she replied, faintly, for she was half afraid.\n\nThe great scientist was stooping over, looking at the balances of the\nindicators through microscopes.\n\nShe saw him reach for his switches, and then a brusk order caused her to\nturn her eyes back to the animals, the cat in the right-hand cage, the\nmonkey at the left.\n\nBoth animals screamed in fear, and a sympathetic chorus sounded from the\nmenagerie, as a long purple spark danced from one gray metal pole to the\nother, over the cages on the table.\n\nAt first, Mrs. Baker noticed no change. The spark had died, the\nprofessor's voice, unhurried, grave, broke the silence.\n\n\"The first part of the experiment is over,\" he said. \"The ego--\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" cried the woman. \"You've driven the poor creatures mad!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe indicated the cat. That animal was clawing at the top bars of its\ncage, uttering a bizarre, chattering sound, somewhat like a monkey. The\ncat hung from the bars, swinging itself back and forth as on a trapeze,\nthen reached up and hung by its hind claws.\n\nAs for the monkey, it was squatting on the floor of its cage, and it\nmade a strange sound in its throat, almost a mew, and it hissed several\ntimes at the professor.\n\n\"They are not mad,\" said Burr. \"As I was explaining to you, I have\nfinished the first portion of the experiment. The ego, or personality of\none animal has been taken out and put into the other.\"\n\nShe was unable to speak. He had mentioned madness: was he, Professor\nRamsey Burr, crazy? It was likely enough. Yet--yet the whole thing, in\nthese surroundings, seemed plausible. As she hesitated about speaking,\nwatching with fascinated eyes the out-of-character behavior of the two\nbeasts, Burr went on.\n\n\"The second part follows at once. Now that the two egos have\ninterchanged, I will shift the bodies. When it is completed, the monkey\nwill have taken the place of the cat, and vice versa. Watch.\"\n\nHe was busy for some time with his levers, and the smell of ozone\nreached Mrs. Baker's nostrils as she stared with horrified eyes at the\nanimals.\n\nShe blinked. The sparks crackled madly, the monkey mewed, the cat\nchattered.\n\nWere her eyes going back on her? She could see neither animal\ndistinctly: they seemed to be shaking in some cosmic disturbance, and\nwere but blurs. This illusion--for to her, it seemed it must be\noptical--persisted, grew worse, until the quaking forms of the two\nunfortunate creatures were like so much ectoplasm in swift motion,\nghosts whirling about in a dark room.\n\nYet she could see the cages quite distinctly, and the table and even the\nindicators of the scales. She closed her eyes for a moment. The acrid\nodors penetrated to her lungs, and she coughed, opening her eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow she could see clearly again. Yes, she could see a monkey, and it was\nclimbing, quite naturally about its cage; it was excited, but a monkey.\nAnd the cat, while protesting mightily, acted like a cat.\n\nThen she gasped. Had her mind, in the excitement, betrayed her? She\nlooked at Professor Burr. On his lean face there was a smile of triumph,\nand he seemed to be awaiting her applause.\n\nShe looked again at the two cages. Surely, at first the cat had been in\nthe right-hand cage, and the monkey in the left! And now, the monkey was\nin the place where the cat had been and the cat had been shifted to the\nleft-hand cage.\n\n\"So it was with Smith, when the alloys burned out,\" said Burr. \"It is\nimpossible to extract the ego or dissolve the atoms and translate them\ninto radio waves unless there is a connection with some other ego and\nbody, for in such a case the translated soul and body would have no\nplace to go. Luckily, for you, madam, it was the man Smith who was\nkilled when the alloys failed me. It might have been Allen, for he was\nthe second pole of the connection.\"\n\n\"But,\" she began faintly, \"how can this mad experiment have anything to\ndo with saving my boy?\"\n\nHe waved impatiently at her evident denseness. \"Do you not understand?\nIt is so I will save Allen, your son. I shall first switch our egos, or\nsouls, as you say. Then switch the bodies. It must always take this\nsequence; why, I have not ascertained. But it always works thus.\"\n\nMrs. Baker was terrified. What she had just seen, smacked of the\nblackest magic--yet a woman in her position must grasp at straws. The\nworld blamed her son for the murder of Smith, a man Professor Burr had\nmade use of as he might a guinea pig, and Allen must be snatched from\nthe death house.\n\n\"Do--do you mean you can bring Allen from the prison here--just by\nthrowing those switches?\" she asked.\n\n\"That is it. But there is more to it than that, for it is not magic,\nmadam; it is science, you understand, and there must be some physical\nconnection. But with your help, that can easily be made.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Ramsey Burr, she knew, was the greatest electrical engineer\nthe world had ever known. And he stood high as a physicist. Nothing\nhindered him in the pursuit of knowledge, they said. He knew no fear,\nand he lived on an intellectual promontory. He was so great that he\nalmost lost sight of himself. To such a man, nothing was impossible.\nHope, wild hope, sprang in Mary Baker's heart, and she grasped the bony\nhand of the professor and kissed it.\n\n\"Oh, I believe, I believe,\" she cried. \"You can do it. You can save\nAllen. I will do anything, anything you tell me to.\"\n\n\"Very well. You visit your son daily at the death house, do you not?\"\n\nShe nodded; a shiver of remembrance of that dread spot passed through\nher.\n\n\"Then you will tell him the plan and let him agree to see me the night\npreceding the electrocution. I will give him final instructions as to\nthe exchange of bodies. When my life spirit, or ego, is confined in your\nson's body in the death house, Allen will be able to perform the feat of\nchanging the bodies, and your son's flesh will join his soul, which will\nhave been temporarily inhabiting my own shell. Do you see? When they\nfind me in the cell where they suppose your son to be, they will be\nunable to explain the phenomenon; they can do nothing but release me.\nYour son will go here, and can be whisked away to a safe place of\nconcealment.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. What am I to do besides this?\"\n\nProfessor Burr pulled out a drawer near at hand, and from it extracted a\nfolded garment of thin, shiny material.\n\n\"This is metal cloth coated with the new alloy,\" he said, in a matter of\nfact tone. He rummaged further, saying as he did so, \"I expected you\nwould be here to see me, and I have been getting ready for your visit.\nAll is prepared, save a few odds and ends which I can easily clean up in\nthe next two days. Here are four cups which Allen must place under each\nleg of his bed, and this delicate little director coil you must take\nespecial pains with. It is to be slipped under your son's tongue at the\ntime appointed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was staring at him still, half in fear, half in wonder, yet she\ncould not feel any doubt of the man's miraculous powers. Somehow, while\nhe talked to her and rested those cold eyes upon her, she was under the\nspell of the great scientist. Her son, before the trouble into which he\nhad been dragged by the professor, had often hinted at the abilities of\nRamsey Burr, given her the idea that his employer was practically a\nnecromancer, yet a magician whose advanced scientific knowledge was\ncorrect and explainable in the light of reason.\n\nYes, Allen had talked to her often when he was at home, resting from his\nlabors with Professor Burr. He had spoken of the new electricity\ndiscovered by the famous man, and also told his mother that Burr had\nfound a method of separating atoms and then transforming them into a\nform of radio-electricity so that they could be sent in radio waves, to\ndesignated points. And she now remembered--the swift trial and\nconviction of Allen on the charge of murder had occupied her so deeply\nthat she had forgotten all else for the time being--that her son had\ninformed her quite seriously that Professor Ramsey Burr would soon be\nable to transport human beings by radio.\n\n\"Neither of us will be injured in any way by the change,\" said Burr\ncalmly. \"It is possible for me now to break up human flesh, send the\natoms by radio-electricity, and reassemble them in their proper form by\nthese special transformers and atom filters.\"\n\nMrs. Baker took all the apparatus presented her by the professor. She\nventured the thought that it might be better to perform the experiment\nat once, instead of waiting until the last minute, but this Professor\nBurr waved aside as impossible. He needed the extra time, he said, and\nthere was no hurry.\n\nShe glanced about the room, and her eye took in the giant switches of\ncopper with their black handles; there were others of a gray-green metal\nshe did not recognize. Many dials and meters, strange to her, confronted\nthe little woman. These things, she felt with a rush of gratitude toward\nthe inanimate objects, would help to save her son, so they interested\nher and she began to feel kindly toward the great machines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWould Professor Burr be able to save Allen as he claimed? Yes, she\nthought, he could. She would make Allen consent to the trial of it, even\nthough her son had cursed the scientist and cried he would never speak\nto Ramsey Burr again.\n\nShe was escorted from the home of the professor by Jared, and going out\ninto the bright, sunlit street, blinked as her eyes adjusted themselves\nto the daylight after the queer light of the laboratory. In a bundle she\nhad a strange suit and the cups; her purse held the tiny coil, wrapped\nin cotton.\n\nHow could she get the authorities to consent to her son having the suit?\nThe cups and the coil she might slip to him herself. She decided that a\nmother would be allowed to give her son new underwear. Yes, she would\nsay it was that.\n\nShe started at once for the prison. Professor Burr's laboratory was but\ntwenty miles from the cell where her son was incarcerated.\n\nAs she rode on the train, seeing people in everyday attire, commonplace\noccurrences going on about her, the spell of Professor Burr faded, and\ncold reason stared her in the face. Was it nonsense, this idea of\ntransporting bodies through the air, in invisible waves? Yet, she was\nold-fashioned; the age of miracles had not passed for her. Radio, in\nwhich pictures and voices could be sent on wireless waves, was\nunexplainable to her. Perhaps--\n\nShe sighed, and shook her head. It was hard to believe. It was also hard\nto believe that her son was in deadly peril, condemned to death as a\n\"scientific fiend.\"\n\nHere was her station. A taxi took her to the prison, and after a talk\nwith the warden, finally she stood there, before the screen through\nwhich she could talk to Allen, her son.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\nHer heart lifted, melted within her. It was always thus when he spoke.\n\"Allen,\" she whispered softly.\n\nThey were allowed to talk undisturbed.\n\n\"Professor Burr wishes to help you,\" she said, in a low voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer son, Allen Baker, M. D., turned eyes of misery upon her. His ruddy\nhair was awry. This young man was imaginative and could therefore suffer\ndeeply. He had the gift of turning platitudes into puzzles, and his\nhazel eyes were lit with an elfin quality, which, if possible, endeared\nhim the more to his mother. All his life he had been the greatest thing\nin the world to this woman. To see him in such straits tore her very\nheart. When he had been a little boy, she had been able to make joy\nappear in those eyes by a word and a pat; now that he was a man, the\nmatter was more difficult, but she had always done her best.\n\n\"I cannot allow Professor Burr to do anything for me,\" he said dully.\n\"It is his fault that I am here.\"\n\n\"But Allen, you must listen, listen carefully. Professor Burr can save\nyou. He says it was all a mistake, the alloy was wrong. He has not come\nforward before, because he knew he would be able to iron out the trouble\nif he had time, and thus snatch you from this terrible place.\"\n\nShe put as much confidence into her voice as she could. She must, to\nenhearten her son. Anything to replace that look of suffering with one\nof hope. She would believe, she did believe. The bars, the great masses\nof stone which enclosed her son would be as nothing. He would pass\nthrough them, unseen, unheard.\n\nFor a time, Allen spoke bitterly of Ramsey Burr, but his mother pleaded\nwith him, telling him it was his only chance, and that the deviltry\nAllen suspected was imaginary.\n\n\"He--he killed Smith in such an experiment,\" said Allen. \"I took the\nblame, as you know, though I only followed his instructions. But you say\nhe claims to have found the correct alloys?\"\n\n\"Yes. And this suit, you must put it on. But Professor Burr himself will\nbe here to see you day after to-morrow, the day preceding the--the--\"\nShe bit her lip, and got out the dreaded word, \"the electrocution. But\nthere won't be any electrocution, Allen; no, there cannot be. You will\nbe safe, safe in my arms.\" She had to fight now to hold her belief in\nthe miracle which Burr had promised. The solid steel and stone dismayed\nher brain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe new alloy seemed to interest Allen Baker. His mother told him of the\nexchange of the monkey and the cat, and he nodded excitedly, growing\nmore and more restive, and his eyes began to shine with hope and\ncuriosity.\n\n\"I have told the warden about the suit, saying it was something I made\nfor you myself,\" she said, in a low voice. \"You must pretend the coil\nand the cups are things you desire for your own amusement. You know,\nthey have allowed you a great deal of latitude, since you are educated\nand need diversion.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. There may be some difficulty, but I will overcome that. Tell\nBurr to come. I'll talk with him and he can instruct me in the final\ndetails. It is better than waiting here like a rat in a trap. I have\nbeen afraid of going mad, mother, but this buoys me up.\"\n\nHe smiled at her, and her heart sang in the joy of relief.\n\nHow did the intervening days pass? Mrs. Baker could not sleep, could\nscarcely eat, she could do nothing but wait, wait, wait. She watched the\nmeeting of her son and Ramsey Burr, on the day preceding the date set\nfor the execution.\n\n\"Well, Baker,\" said Burr nonchalantly, nodding to his former assistant.\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"You see how I am,\" said Allen, coldly.\n\n\"Yes, yes. Well, listen to what I have to say and note it carefully.\nThere must be no slip. You have the suit, the cups and the director\ncoil? You must keep the suit on, the cups go under the legs of the cot\nyou lie on. The director under your tongue.\"\n\nThe professor spoke further with Allen, instructing him in scientific\nterms which the woman scarcely comprehended.\n\n\"To-night, then at eleven-thirty,\" said Burr, finally. \"Be ready.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAllen nodded. Mrs. Baker accompanied Burr from the prison.\n\n\"You--you will let me be with you?\" she begged.\n\n\"It is hardly necessary,\" said the professor.\n\n\"But I must. I must see Allen the moment he is free, to make sure he is\nall right. Then, I want to be able to take him away. I have a place in\nwhich we can hide, and as soon as he is rescued he must be taken out of\nsight.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Burr, shrugging. \"It is immaterial to me, so long as\nyou do not interfere with the course of the experiment. You must sit\nperfectly still, you must not speak until Allen stands before you and\naddresses you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will obey you,\" she promised.\n\nMrs. Baker watched Professor Ramsey Burr eat his supper. Burr himself\nwas not in the least perturbed; it was wonderful, she thought, that he\ncould be so calm. To her, it was the great moment, the moment when her\nson would be saved from the jaws of death.\n\nJared carried a comfortable chair into the laboratory and she sat in it,\nquiet as a mouse, in one corner of the room.\n\nIt was nine o'clock, and Professor Burr was busy with his preparations.\nShe knew he had been working steadily for the past few days. She gripped\nthe arms of her chair, and her heart burned within her.\n\nThe professor was making sure of his apparatus. He tested this bulb and\nthat, and carefully inspected the curious oscillating platform, over\nwhich was suspended a thickly bunched group of gray-green wire, which\nwas seemingly an antenna. The numerous indicators and implements seemed\nto be satisfactory, for at quarter after eleven Burr gave an exclamation\nof pleasure and nodded to himself.\n\nBurr seemed to have forgotten the woman. He spoke aloud occasionally,\nbut not to her, as he drew forth a suit made of the same metal cloth as\nAllen must have on at this moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tension was terrific, terrific for the mother, who was awaiting the\nculmination of the experiment which would rescue her son from the\nelectric chair--or would it fail? She shuddered. What if Burr were mad?\n\nBut look at him, she was sure he was sane, as sane as she was.\n\n\"He will succeed,\" she murmured, digging her nails into the palms of her\nhands. \"I _know_ he will.\"\n\nShe pushed aside the picture of what would happen on the morrow, but a\nfew hours distant, when Allen, her son, was due to be led to a legal\ndeath in the electric chair.\n\nProfessor Burr placed the shiny suit upon his lank form, and she saw him\nput a duplicate coil, the same sort of small machine which Allen\npossessed, under his tongue.\n\nThe Mephistophelian figure consulted a matter-of-fact watch; at that\nmoment, Mrs. Baker heard, above the hum of the myriad machines in the\nlaboratory, the slow chiming of a clock. It was the moment set for the\ndeed.\n\nThen, she feared the professor was insane, for he suddenly leaped to the\nhigh bench of the table on which stood one of the oscillating platforms.\n\nWires led out from this, and Burr sat gently upon it, a strange figure\nin the subdued light.\n\nProfessor Burr, however, she soon saw, was not insane. No, this was part\nof it. He was reaching for switches near at hand, and bulbs began to\nglow with unpleasant light, needles on indicators swung madly, and at\nlast, Professor Burr kicked over a giant switch, which seemed to be the\nfinal movement.\n\nFor several seconds the professor did not move. Then his body grew\nrigid, and he twisted a few times. His face, though not drawn in pain,\nyet twitched galvanically, as though actuated by slight jabs of\nelectricity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe many tubes fluoresced, flared up in pulsing waves of violet and\npink: there were gray bars of invisibility or areas of air in which\nnothing visible showed. There came the faint, crackling hum of machinery\nrather like a swarm of wasps in anger. Blue and gray thread of fire spat\nacross the antenna. The odor of ozone came to Mrs. Baker's nostrils,\nand the acid odors burned her lungs.\n\nShe was staring at him, staring at the professor's face. She half rose\nfrom her chair, and uttered a little cry.\n\nThe eyes had changed, no longer were they cold, impersonal, the eyes of\na man who prided himself on the fact that he kept his arteries soft and\nhis heart hard; they were loving, soft eyes.\n\n\"Allen,\" she cried.\n\nYes, without doubt, the eyes of her son were looking at her out of the\nbody of Professor Ramsey Burr.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said gently. \"Don't be alarmed. It is successful. I am\nhere, in Professor Burr's body.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she cried, hysterically. It was too weird to believe. It seemed\ndim to her, unearthly.\n\n\"Are you all right, darling?\" she asked timidly.\n\n\"Yes. I felt nothing beyond a momentary giddy spell, a bit of nausea and\nmental stiffness. It was strange, and I have a slight headache. However,\nall is well.\"\n\nHe grinned at her, laughed with the voice which was not his, yet which\nshe recognized as directed by her son's spirit. The laugh was cracked\nand unlike Allen's whole-hearted mirth, yet she smiled in sympathy.\n\n\"Yes, the first part is a success,\" said the man. \"Our egos have\ninterchanged. Soon, our bodies will undergo the transformation, and then\nI must keep under cover. I dislike Burr--yet he is a great man. He has\nsaved me. I suppose the slight headache which I feel is one bequeathed\nme by Burr. I hope he inherits my shivers and terrors and the neuralgia\nfor the time being, so he will get some idea of what I have undergone.\"\n\nHe had got down from the oscillating platform, the spirit of her son in\nRamsey's body.\n\n\"What--what are you doing now?\" she asked.\n\n\"I must carry out the rest of it myself,\" he said. \"Burr directed me\nwhen we talked yesterday. It is more difficult when one subject is out\nof the laboratory, and the tubes must be checked.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went carefully about his work, and she saw him replacing four of the\ntubes with others, new ones, which were ready at hand. Though it was the\nbody of Ramsey Burr, the movements were different from the slow, precise\nwork of the professor, and more and more, she realized that her son\ninhabited the shell before her.\n\nFor a moment, the mother thought of attempting to dissuade her son from\nmaking the final change; was it not better thus, than to chance the\ndisintegration of the bodies? Suppose something went wrong, and the\nexchange did not take place, and her son, that is, his spirit, went back\nto the death house?\n\nMidnight struck as he worked feverishly at the apparatus, the long face\ncorrugated as he checked the dials and tubes. He worked swiftly, but\nevidently was following a procedure which he had committed to memory,\nfor he was forced to pause often to make sure of himself.\n\n\"Everything is O. K.,\" said the strange voice at last. He consulted his\nwatch. \"Twelve-thirty,\" he said.\n\nShe bit her lip in terror, as he cried, \"Now!\" and sprang to the table\nto take his place on the metallic platform, which oscillated to and fro\nunder his weight. The delicate grayish metal antenna, which, she knew,\nwould form a glittering halo of blue and gray threads of fire, rested\nquiescent above his head.\n\n\"This is the last thing,\" he said calmly, as he reached for the big\nebony handled switch. \"I'll be myself in a few minutes, mother.\"\n\n\"Yes, son, yes.\"\n\nThe switch connected, and Allen Baker, in the form of Ramsey Burr,\nsuddenly cried out in pain. His mother leaped up to run to his side, but\nhe waved her away. She stood, wringing her hands, as he began to twist\nand turn, as though torn by some invisible force. Eery screams came\nfrom the throat of the man on the platform, and Mrs. Baker's cries of\nsympathy mingled with them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mighty motors hummed in a high-pitched, unnatural whine, and\nsuddenly Mrs. Baker saw the tortured face before her grow dim. The\ncountenance of the professor seemed to melt, and then there came a dull,\nmuffled thud, a burst of white-blue flame, the odor of burning rubber\nand the tinkle of broken glass.\n\nBack to the face came the clarity of outline, and still it was Professor\nRamsey Burr's body she stared at.\n\nHer son, in the professor's shape, climbed from the platform, and looked\nabout him as though dazed. An acrid smoke filled the room, and burning\ninsulation assailed the nostrils.\n\nDesperately, without looking at her, his lips set in a determined line,\nthe man went hurriedly over the apparatus again.\n\n\"Have I forgotten, did I do anything wrong?\" she heard his anguished\ncry.\n\nTwo tubes were burned out, and these he replaced as swiftly as possible.\nBut he was forced to go all over the wiring, and cut out whatever had\nbeen short-circuited so that it could be hooked up anew with uninjured\nwire.\n\nBefore he was ready to resume his seat on the platform, after half an\nhour of feverish haste, a knock came on the door.\n\nThe person outside was imperative, and Mrs. Baker ran over and opened\nthe portal. Jared, the whites of his eyes shining in the dim light,\nstood there. \"De professah--tell him dat de wahden wishes to talk with\nhim. It is very important, ma'am.\"\n\nThe body of Burr, inhabited by Allen's soul, pushed by her, and she\nfollowed falteringly, wringing her hands. She saw the tall figure snatch\nat the receiver and listen.\n\n\"Oh, God,\" he cried.\n\nAt last, he put the receiver back on the hook, automatically, and sank\ndown in a chair, his face in his hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMrs. Baker went to him quickly. \"What is it, Allen?\" she cried.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said hoarsely, \"it was the warden of the prison. He told me\nthat Allen Baker had gone temporarily insane, and claimed to be\nProfessor Ramsey Burr in my body.\"\n\n\"But--but what is the matter?\" she asked. \"Cannot you finish the\nexperiment, Allen? Can't you change the two bodies now?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Mother--they electrocuted Ramsey Burr in my body at\ntwelve forty-five to-night!\"\n\nShe screamed. She was faint, but she controlled herself with a great\neffort.\n\n\"But the electrocution was not to be until morning,\" she said.\n\nAllen shook his head. \"They are allowed a certain latitude, about twelve\nhours,\" he said. \"Burr protested up to the last moment, and begged for\ntime.\"\n\n\"Then--then they must have come for him and dragged him forth to die in\nthe electric chair while you were attempting the second part of the\nchange,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes. That was why it failed. That's why the tubes and wires burned out\nand why we couldn't exchange bodies. It began to succeed, then I could\nfeel something terrible had happened. It was impossible to complete the\nBeta circuit, which short-circuited. They took him from the cell, do you\nsee, while I was starting the exchange of the atoms.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a time, the mother and her boy sat staring at one another. She saw\nthe tall, eccentric figure of Ramsey Burr before her, yet she saw also\nthe soul of her son within that form. The eyes were Allen's, the voice\nwas soft and loving, and his spirit was with her.\n\n\"Come, Allen, my son,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Burr paid the price,\" said Allen, shaking his head. \"He became a martyr\nto science.\"\n\nThe world has wondered why Professor Ramsey Burr, so much in the\nheadlines as a great scientist, suddenly gave up all his experiments and\ntook up the practice of medicine.\n\nNow that the public furor and indignation over the death of the man\nSmith has died down, sentimentalists believe that Ramsey Burr has\nreformed and changed his icy nature, for he manifests great affection\nand care for Mrs. Mary Baker, the mother of the electrocuted man who had\nbeen his assistant.\n\n\n                +--------------------------------------+\n                |             BY NO MEANS              |\n                |   _Miss the Opening Installment of   |\n                |  the Extraordinary Four-Part Novel_  |\n                |            MURDER MADNESS            |\n                |         _By Murray Leinster_         |\n                |                                      |\n                |     _Starting In Our Next Issue_     |\n                +--------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\nThe Ray of Madness\n\n_By Captain S.

The famous scientist paid no attention to the\ninterruption but bent his head lower over the spectroscope with which he\nwas working. The knock was repeated with a quality of quiet insistence\nupon recognition. The Doctor smothered an exclamation of impatience and\nstrode over to the door and threw it open to the knocker.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Carnes,\" he exclaimed as he recognized his visitor. \"Come in\nand sit down and keep your mouth shut for a few minutes. I am busy just\nnow but I'll be at liberty in a little while.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"There's no hurry, Doctor,\" replied Operative Carnes of the United\nStates Secret Service as he entered the room and sat on the edge of the\nDoctor's desk. \"I haven't got a case up my sleeve this time; I just came\nin for a little chat.\"\n\n\"All right, glad to see you. Read that latest volume of the\n_Zeitschrift_ for a while. That article of Von Beyer's has got me\nguessing, all right.\"\n\nCarnes picked up the indicated volume and settled himself to read. The\nDoctor bent over his apparatus. Time and again he made minute\nadjustments and gave vent to muttered exclamations of annoyance at the\nresults he obtained. Half an hour later he rose from his chair with a\nsigh and turned to his visitor.\n\n\"What do you think of Von Beyer's alleged discovery?\" he asked the\noperative.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's too deep for me, Doctor,\" replied the operative. \"All that I can\nmake out of it is that he claims to have discovered a new element named\n'lunium,' but hasn't been able to isolate it yet. Is there anything\nremarkable about that? It seems to me that I have read of other new\nelements being discovered from time to time.\"\n\n\"There is nothing remarkable about the discovery of a new element by the\nspectroscopic method,\" replied Dr. Bird. \"We know from Mendeleff's\ntable that there are a number of elements which we have not discovered\nas yet, and several of the ones we know were first detected by the\nspectroscope. The thing which puzzles me is that so brilliant a man as\nVon Beyer claims to have discovered it in the spectra of the moon. His\nname, lunium, is taken from Luna, the moon.\"\n\n\"Why not the moon? Haven't several elements been first discovered in the\nspectra of stars?\"\n\n\"Certainly. The classic example is Lockyer's discovery of an orange line\nin the spectra of the sun in 1868. No known terrestrial element gave\nsuch a line and he named the new element which he deduced helium, from\nHelos, the sun. The element helium was first isolated by Ramsey some\ntwenty-seven years later. Other elements have been found in the spectra\nof stars, but the point I am making is that the sun and the stars are\nincandescent bodies and could be logically expected to show the\ncharacteristic lines of their constituent elements in their spectra. But\nthe moon is a cold body without an atmosphere and is visible only by\nreflected light. The element, lunium, may exist in the moon, but the\nmanifestations which Von Beyer has observed must be, not from the moon,\nbut from the source of the reflected light which he spectro-analyzed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You are over my depth, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I'm over my own. I have tried to follow Von Beyer's reasoning and I\nhave tried to check his findings. Twice this evening I thought that I\ncaught a momentary glimpse on the screen of my fluoroscope of the\nultra-violet line which he reports as characteristic of lunium, but I am\nnot certain. I haven't been able to photograph it yet. He notes in his\narticle that the line seems to be quite impermanent and fades so rapidly\nthat an accurate measurement of its wave-length is almost impossible.\nHowever, let's drop the subject. How do you like your new assignment?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right. I would rather be back on my old work.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen you since you were assigned to the Presidential detail.\nI suppose that you fellows are pretty busy getting ready for Premier\nMcDougal's visit?\"\n\n\"I doubt if he will come,\" replied Carnes soberly. \"Things are not\nexactly propitious for a visit of that sort just now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird sat back in his chair in surprise.\n\n\"I thought that the whole thing is arranged. The press seems to think\nso, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Everything is arranged, but arrangements may be cancelled. I wouldn't\nbe surprised to hear that they were.\"\n\n\"Carnes,\" replied Dr. Bird gravely, \"you have either said too much or\ntoo little. There is something more to this than appears on the surface.\nIf it is none of my business, don't hesitate to tell me so and I'll\nforget what you have said, but if I can help you any, speak up.\"\n\nCarnes puffed meditatively at his pipe for a few minutes before\nreplying.\n\n\"It's really none of your business. Doctor,\" he said at length, \"and yet\nI know that a corpse is a chatterbox compared to you when you are told\nanything in confidence, and I really need to unload my mind. It has been\nkept from the press so far; but I don't know how long it can be kept\nmuzzled. In strict confidence, the President of the United State acts\nas though he were crazy.\"\n\n\"Quite a section of the press has claimed that for a long time,\" replied\nDr. Bird, with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"I don't mean crazy in that way, Doctor, I mean _really_ crazy. Bugs!\nNuts! Bats in his belfry!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird whistled softly.\n\n\"Are you sure, Carnes?\" he asked.\n\n\"As sure as may be. Both of his physicians think so. They were\nnon-committal for a while, especially as the first attack waned and he\nseemed to recover, but when his second attack came on more violently\nthan the first and the President began to act queerly, they had to take\nthe Presidential detail into their confidence. He has been quietly\nexamined by some of the greatest psychiatrists in the country, but none\nof them have ventured on a positive verdict as to the nature of the\nmalady. They admit, of course, that it exists, but they won't classify\nit. The fact that it is intermittent seems to have them stopped. He was\nbad a month ago but he recovered and became, to all appearances, normal\nfor a time. About a week ago he began to show queer symptoms again and\nnow he is getting worse daily. If he goes on getting worse for another\nweek, it will have to be announced so that the Vice-President can take\nover the duties of the head of the government.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are the symptoms?\"\n\n\"The first we noticed was a failing of his memory. Coupled with this was\na restlessness and a habit of nocturnal prowling. He tosses continually\non his bed and mutters and at times leaps up and rages back and forth in\nhis bedchamber, howling and raging. Then he will calm down and compose\nhimself and go to sleep, only to wake in half an hour and go through the\nsame performance. It is pretty ghastly for the men on night guard.\"\n\n\"How does he act in the daytime?\"\n\n\"Heavy and lethargic. His memory becomes a complete blank at times and\nhe talks wildly. Those are the times we must guard against.\"\n\n\"Overwork?\" queried the Doctor.\n\n\"Not according to his physicians. His physical health is splendid and\nhis appetite unusually keen. He takes his exercise regularly and suffers\nno ill health except for a little eye trouble.\"\n\nDr. Bird leaped to his feet.\n\n\"Tell me more about this eye trouble, Carnes,\" he demanded.\n\n\"Why, I don't know much about it, Doctor. Admiral Clay told me that it\nwas nothing but a mild opthalmia which should yield readily to\ntreatment. That was when he told me to see that the shades of the\nPresident's study were partially drawn to keep the direct sunlight out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Opthalmia be sugared! What do his eyes look like?\"\n\n\"They are rather red and swollen and a little bloodshot. He has a\ntendency to shut them while he is talking and he avoids light as much as\npossible. I hadn't noticed anything peculiar about it.\"\n\n\"Carnes, did you ever see a case of snow blindness?\"\n\nThe operative looked up in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, I have. I had it myself once in Maine. Now that you mention it,\nhis case does look like snow blindness, but such a thing is absurd in\nWashington in August.\"\n\nDr. Bird rummaged in his desk and drew out a book, which he consulted\nfor a moment.\n\n\"Now, Carnes,\" he said, \"I want some dates from you and I want them\naccurately. Don't guess, for a great deal may depend on the accuracy of\nyour answers. When was this mental disability on the part of the\nPresident first noticed?\"\n\nCarnes drew a pocket diary from his coat and consulted it.\n\n\"The seventeenth of July,\" he replied. \"That is, we are sure, in view\nof later developments, that that was the date it first came on. We\ndidn't realize that anything was wrong until the twentieth. On the night\nof the nineteenth the President slept very poorly, getting up and\ncreating a disturbance twice, and on the twentieth he acted so queerly\nthat it was necessary to cancel three conferences.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird checked off the dates on the book before him and nodded.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, \"and describe the progress of the malady by days.\"\n\n\"It got progressively worse until the night of the twenty-third. The\ntwenty-fourth he was no worse, and on the twenty-fifth a slight\nimprovement was noticed. He got steadily better until, by the third or\nfourth of August, he was apparently normal. About the twelfth he began\nto show signs of restlessness which have increased daily during the past\nweek. Last night, the nineteenth, he slept only a few minutes and Brady,\nwho was on guard, says that his howls were terrible. His memory has been\nalmost a total blank today and all of his appointments were cancelled,\nostensibly because of his eye trouble. If he gets any worse, it probably\nwill be necessary to inform the country as to his true condition.\"\n\nWhen Carnes had finished, Dr. Bird sat for a time in concentrated\nthought.\n\n\"You did exactly right in coming to me, Carnes,\" he said presently. \"I\ndon't think that this is a job for a doctor at all--I believe that it\nneeds a physicist and a chemist and possibly a detective to cure him.\nWe'll get busy.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Doctor?\" demanded Carnes. \"Do you think that some\nexterior force is causing the President's disability?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think nothing, Carnes,\" replied the Doctor grimly, \"but I intend to\nknow something before I am through. Don't ask for explanations: this is\nnot the time for talk, it is the time for action. Can you get me into\nthe White House to-night?\"\n\n\"I doubt it, Doctor, but I'll try. What excuse shall I give? I am not\nsupposed to have told you anything about the President's illness.\"\n\n\"Get Bolton, your chief, on the phone and tell him that you have talked\nto me when you shouldn't have. He'll blow up, but after he is through\nexploding, tell him that I smell a rat and that I want him down here at\nonce with _carte blanche_ authority to do as I see fit in the White\nHouse. If he makes any fuss about it, remind him of the fact that he has\nconsidered me crazy several times in the past when events showed that I\nwas right. If he won't play after that, let me talk to him.\"\n\n\"All right, Doctor,\" replied Carnes as he picked up the scientist's\ntelephone and gave the number of the home of the Chief of the Secret\nService. \"I'll try to bully him out of it. He has a good deal of\nconfidence in your ability.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour later the door of Dr. Bird's laboratory opened suddenly to\nadmit Bolton.\n\n\"Hello, Doctor,\" exclaimed the Chief, \"what the dickens have you got on\nyour mind now? I ought to skin Carnes alive for talking out of turn, but\nif you really have an idea, I'll forgive him. What do you suspect?\"\n\n\"I suspect several things, Bolton, but I haven't time to tell you what\nthey are. I want to get quietly into the White House as promptly as\npossible.\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" replied Bolton, \"but first I want to know what the object\nof the visit is.\"\n\n\"The object is to see what I can find out. My ideas are entirely too\nnebulous to attempt to lay them out before you just now. You've never\nworked directly with me on a case before, but Carnes can tell you that I\nhave my own methods of working and that I won't spill my ideas until I\nhave something more definite to go on than I have at present.\"\n\n\"The Doctor is right, Chief,\" said Carnes. \"He has an idea all right,\nbut wild horses won't drag it out of him until he's ready to talk.\nYou'll have to take him on faith, as I always do.\"\n\nBolton hesitated a moment and then shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Have it your own way, Doctor,\" he said. \"Your reputation, both as a\nscientist and as an unraveller of tangled skeins, is too good for me to\nboggle about your methods. Tell me what you want and I'll try to get\nit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I want to get into the White House without undue prominence being given\nto my movements, and listen outside the President's door for a short\ntime. Later I will want to examine his sleeping quarters carefully and\nto make a few tests. I may be entirely wrong in my assumptions, but I\nbelieve that there is something there that requires my attention.\"\n\n\"Come along,\" said Bolton. \"I'll get you in and let you listen, but the\nrest we'll have to trust to luck on. You may have to wait until\nmorning.\"\n\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it,\" replied the Doctor. \"I'll\nget a little stuff together that we may need.\"\n\nIn a few moments he had packed some apparatus in a bag and, taking up it\nand an instrument case, he followed Bolton and Carnes down the stairs\nand out onto the grounds of the Bureau of Standards.\n\n\"It's a beautiful moon, isn't it?\" he observed.\n\nCarnes assented absently to the Doctor's remark, but Bolton paid no\nattention to the luminous disc overhead, which was flooding the\nlandscape with its mellow light.\n\n\"My car is waiting,\" he announced.\n\n\"All right, old man, but stop for a moment and admire this moon,\"\nprotested the Doctor. \"Have you ever seen a finer one?\"\n\n\"Come on and let the moon alone,\" snorted Bolton.\n\n\"My dear man, I absolutely refuse to move a step until you pause in your\nheadlong devotion to duty and pay the homage due to Lady Luna. Don't\nyou realize, you benighted Christian, that you are gazing upon what has\nbeen held to be a deity, or at least the visible manifestation of deity,\nfor ages immemorial? Haven't you ever had time to study the history of\nthe moon-worshipping cults? They are as old as mankind, you know. The\nworship of Isis was really only an exalted type of moon worship. The\ncrescent moon, you may remember, was one of her most sacred emblems.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBolton paused and looked at the Doctor suspiciously.\n\n\"What are you doing--pulling my leg?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Not at all, my dear fellow. Carnes, doesn't the sight of the glowing\norb of night influence you to pious meditation upon the frailty of human\nlife and the insignificance of human ambition?\"\n\n\"Not to any very great degree,\" replied Carnes dryly.\n\n\"Carnesy, old dear, I fear that you are a crass materialist. I am\nbeginning to despair of ever inculcating in you any respect for the\nfiner and subtler things of life. I must try Bolton. Bolton, have you\never seen a finer moon? Remember that I won't move a step until you have\ncarefully considered the matter and fully answered my question.\"\n\nBolton looked first at the Doctor, then at Carnes, and finally he looked\nreluctantly at the moon.\n\n\"It's a fine one,\" he admitted, \"but all full moons look large on clear\nnights at this time of the year.\"\n\n\"Then you _have_ studied the moon?\" cried Dr. Bird with delight. \"I was\nsure--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe broke off his speech suddenly and listened. From a distance came the\nmournful howl of a dog. It was answered in a moment by another howl from\na different direction. Dog after dog took up the chorus until the air\nwas filled with the melancholy wailing of the animals.\n\n\"See, Bolton,\" remarked the Doctor, \"even the dogs feel the chastening\ninfluence of the Lady of Night and repent of the sins of their youth and\nthe follies of their manhood, or should one say doghood? Come along. I\nfeel that the call of duty must tear us away from the contemplation of\nthe beauties of nature.\"\n\nHe led the way to Bolton's car and got in without further words. A\nhalf-hour later, Bolton led the way into the White House. A word to the\nsecret service operative on guard at the door admitted him and his\nparty, and he led the way to the newly constructed solarium where the\nPresident slept. An operative stood outside the door.\n\n\"What word, Brady?\" asked Bolton in a whisper.\n\n\"He seems worse, sir. I doubt if he has slept at all. Admiral Clay has\nbeen in several times, but he didn't do much good. There, listen! The\nPresident is getting up again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom behind the closed door which confronted them came sounds of a\nperson rising from a bed and pacing the floor, slowly at first, and then\nmore and more rapidly, until it was almost a run. A series of groans\ncame to the watchers and then a long drawn out howl. Bolton shuddered.\n\n\"Poor devil!\" he muttered.\n\nDr. Bird shot a quick glance around.\n\n\"Where is Admiral Clay?\" he asked.\n\n\"He is sleeping upstairs. Shall I call him?\"\n\n\"No. Take me to his room.\"\n\nThe President's naval physician opened the door in response to Bolton's\nknock.\n\n\"Is he worse?\" he demanded anxiously.\n\n\"I don't think so, Admiral,\" replied Bolton. \"I want to introduce you to\nDr. Bird of the Bureau of Standards. He wants to talk with you about the\ncase.\"\n\n\"I am honored, Doctor,\" said the physician as he grasped the scientist's\noutstretched hand. \"Come in. Pardon my appearance, but I was startled\nout of a doze when you knocked. Have a chair and tell me how I can serve\nyou.\"\n\nDr. Bird drew a notebook from his pocket.\n\n\"I have received certain dates in connection with the President's malady\nfrom Operative Carnes,\" he said, \"and I wish you to verify them.\"\n\n\"Pardon me a moment, Doctor,\" interrupted the Admiral, \"but may I ask\nwhat is your connection with the matter? I was not aware that you were a\nphysician or surgeon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dr. Bird is here by the authority of the secret service,\" replied\nBolton. \"He has no connection with the medical treatment of the\nPresident, but permit me to remind you that the secret service is\nresponsible for the safety of the President and so have a right to\ndemand such details about him as are necessary for his proper\nprotection.\"\n\n\"I have no intention in obstructing you in the proper performance of\nyour duties, Mr. Bolton,\" began the Admiral stiffly.\n\n\"Pardon me, Admiral,\" broke in Dr. Bird, \"it seems to me that we are\ngetting started wrong. I suspect that certain exterior forces are more\nor less concerned in this case and I have communicated my suspicions to\nMr. Bolton. He in turn brought me here in order to request from you your\ncooperation in the matter. We have no idea of demanding anything and are\nreally seeking help which we believe that you can give us.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Admiral,\" said Bolton. \"I had no intention of angering you.\"\n\n\"I am at your service, gentlemen,\" replied Admiral Clay. \"What\ninformation did you wish, Doctor?\"\n\n\"At first merely a verification of the history of the case as I have\nit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird read the notes he had taken down from Carnes and the Admiral\nnodded agreement.\n\n\"Those dates are correct,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, Admiral, there are two further points on which I wish\nenlightenment. The first is the opthalmia which is troubling the\npatient.\"\n\n\"It is nothing to be alarmed about as far as symptoms go, Doctor,\"\nreplied the Admiral. \"It is a rather mild case of irritation, somewhat\nanalogous to granuloma, but rather stubborn. He had an attack several\nweeks ago and while it did not yield to treatment as readily as I could\nhave wished, it did clear up nicely in a couple of weeks and I was quite\nsurprised at this recurrent attack. His sight is in no danger.\"\n\n\"Have you tried to connect this opthalmia with his mental aberrations?\"\n\n\"Why no, Doctor, there is no connection.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I am certain. The slight pain which his eyes give him could never have\nsuch an effect upon the mind of so able and energetic a man as he is.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll let that pass for the moment. The other question is this:\nhas he any form of skin trouble?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Admiral looked up in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, he has,\" he admitted. \"I had mentioned it to no one, for it really\namounts to nothing, but he has a slight attack of some obscure form of\ndermatitis which I am treating. It is affecting only his face and\nhands.\"\n\n\"Please describe it.\"\n\n\"It has taken the form of a brown pigmentation on the hands. On the face\nit causes a slight itching and subsequent peeling of the affected\nareas.\"\n\n\"In other words, it is acting like sunburn?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, somewhat. It is not that, however, for he has been exposed to\nthe sun very little lately, on account of his eyes.\"\n\n\"I notice that he is sleeping in the new solarium which was added last\nwinter to the executive mansion. Can you tell me with what type of glass\nit is equipped?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is not equipped with glass at all, but with fused quartz.\"\n\n\"When did he start to sleep there?\"\n\n\"As soon as it was completed.\"\n\n\"And all the time the windows have been of fused quartz?\"\n\n\"No. They were glazed at first, but the glass was removed and the fused\nquartz substituted at my suggestion about two months ago, just before\nthis trouble started.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Admiral. You have given me several things to think about. My\nideas are a little too nebulous to share as yet but I think that I can\ngive you one piece of very sound advice. The President is spending a\nvery restless night. If you would remove him from the solarium and get\nhim to lie down in a room which is glazed with ordinary glass, and pull\ndown the shades so that he will be in the dark, I think that he will\npass a better night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAdmiral Clay looked keenly into the piercing black eyes of the Doctor.\n\n\"I know something of you by reputation, Bird,\" he said slowly, \"and I\nwill follow your advice. Will you tell me why you make this particular\nsuggestion?\"\n\n\"So that I can work in that solarium to-night without interruption,\"\nreplied Dr. Bird. \"I have some tests which I wish to carry out while it\nis still dark. If my results are negative, forget what I have told you.\nIf they yield any information, I will be glad to share it with you at\nthe proper time. Now get the President out of that solarium and tell me\nwhen the coast is clear.\"\n\nThe Admiral donned a dressing gown and stepped out of the room. He\nreturned in fifteen minutes.\n\n\"The solarium is at your disposal, Doctor,\" he announced. \"Shall I\naccompany you?\"\n\n\"If you wish,\" assented Dr. Bird as he picked up his apparatus and\nstrode out of the room.\n\nIn the solarium he glanced quickly around, noting the position of each\nof the articles of furniture.\n\n\"I presume that the President always sleeps with his head in this\ndirection?\" he remarked, pointing to the pillow on the disturbed bed.\n\nThe Admiral nodded assent. Dr. Bird opened the bag which he had packed\nin his laboratory, took out a sheet of cardboard covered with a metallic\nlooking substance, and placed it on the pillow. He stepped back and\ndonned a pair of smoked glasses, watching it intently. Without a word he\ntook off the glasses and handed them to the Admiral. The Admiral donned\nthem and looked at the pillow. As he did so an exclamation broke from\nhis lips.\n\n\"That plate seems to glow,\" he said in an astonished voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird stepped forward and laid his hand on the pillow. He was wearing\na wrist watch with a radiolite dial. The substance suddenly increased\nits luminescence and began to glow fiercely, long luminous streamers\nseeming to come from the dial. The Doctor took away his hand and\nsubstituted a bottle of liquid for the plate on the pillow. Immediately\nthe bottle began to glow with a phosphorescent light.\n\n\"What on earth is it?\" gasped Carnes.\n\n\"Excitation of a radioactive fluid,\" replied the Doctor. \"The question\nis, what is exciting it. Somebody get a stepladder.\"\n\nWhile Bolton was gone after the ladder, the Doctor took from his bag\nwhat looked like an ordinary pane of glass.\n\n\"Take this, Carnes,\" he directed, \"and start holding it over each of\nthose panes of quartz which you can reach. Stop when I tell you to.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe operative held the glass over each of the panes in succession, but\nthe Doctor, who kept his eyes covered with the smoked glasses and\nfastened on the plate which he had replaced on the pillow, said nothing.\nWhen Bolton arrived with the ladder, the process went on. One end and\nmost of the front of the solarium had been covered before an exclamation\nfrom the Doctor halted the work.\n\n\"That's the one,\" he exclaimed. \"Hold the glass there for a moment.\"\n\nHurriedly he removed the plate from the pillow and replaced the phial of\nliquid. There was only a very feeble glow.\n\n\"Good enough,\" he cried. \"Take away the glass, but mark that pane, and\nbe ready to replace it when I give the word.\"\n\nFrom the instrument case he had brought he took out a spectroscope. He\nturned back the mattress and mounted it on the bedstead.\n\n\"Cover that pane,\" he directed.\n\nCarnes did so, and the Doctor swung the receiving tube of the instrument\nuntil it pointed at the covered pane. He glanced into the eyepiece, and\nthen held a tiny flashlight for an instant opposite the third tube.\n\n\"Uncover that pane,\" he said.\n\nCarnes took down the glass plate and the Doctor gazed into the\ninstrument. He made some adjustments.\n\n\"Are you familiar with spectroscopy, Admiral?\" he asked.\n\n\"Somewhat.\"\n\n\"Take a squint in here and tell me what you see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Admiral applied his eye to the instrument and looked long and\nearnestly.\n\n\"There are some lines there, Doctor,\" he said, \"but your instrument is\nbadly out of adjustment. They are in what should be the ultra-violet\nsector, according to your scale.\"\n\n\"I forgot to tell you that this is a fluoroscopic spectroscope designed\nfor the detection of ultra-violet lines,\" replied Dr. Bird. \"Those lines\nyou see are ultra-violet, made visible to the eye by activation of a\nradioactive compound whose rays in turn impinge on a zinc blende sheet.\nDo you recognize the lines?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Small wonder; I doubt whether there are a dozen people who would. I\nhave never seen them before, although I recognize them from descriptions\nI have read. Bolton, come here. Sight along this instrument and through\nthat plate of glass which Carnes is holding and tell me what office that\nwindow belongs to.\"\n\nBolton sighted as directed up at the side of the State, War and Navy\nBuilding.\n\n\"I can't tell exactly at this time of night, Doctor,\" he said, \"but I'll\ngo into the building and find out.\"\n\n\"Do so. Have you a flashlight?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Flash it momentarily out of each of the suspected windows in turn until\nyou get an answering flash from here. When you do, flash it out of each\npane of glass in the window until you get another flash from here. Then\ncome back and tell me what office it is. Mark the pane so that we can\nlocate it again in the morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is the office of the Assistant to the Adjutant General of the Army,\"\nreported Bolton ten minutes later.\n\n\"What is there in the room?\"\n\n\"Nothing but the usual desks and chairs.\"\n\n\"I suspected as much. The window is merely a reflector. That is all that\nwe can do for to-night, gentlemen. Admiral, keep your patient quiet and\nin a room with _glass_ windows, preferably with the shades drawn, until\nfurther notice. Bolton, meet me here with Carnes at sunrise. Have a\npicked detail of ten men standing by where we can get hold of them in a\nhurry. In the mean time, get the Chief of Air Service out of bed and\nhave him order a plane at Langley Field to be ready to take off at 6\nA. M. He is not to take off, however, until I give him orders to do so.\nDo you understand?\"\n\n\"Everything will be ready for you, Doctor, but I confess that I don't\nknow what it is all about.\"\n\n\"It's the biggest case you ever tackled, old man, and I hope that we can\npull it off successfully. I'd like to go over it with you now, but I'll\nbe busy at the Bureau for the rest of the night. Drop me off there, will\nyou?\"\n\nAt sunrise the next morning, Bolton met Dr. Bird at the entrance to the\nWhite House grounds.\n\n\"Where is your detail?\" he asked.\n\n\"In the State, War and Navy Building.\"\n\n\"Good. I want to go to the solarium, put a light on the place where the\nPresident's pillow was last night, and mark that pane of quartz we were\nlooking through. Then we'll join the detail.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird placed the light and walked with Carnes across the White House\ngrounds. Bolton's badge secured admission to the State, War and Navy\nBuilding for the party and they made their way to the office of the\nAssistant to the Adjutant General.\n\n\"Did you mark the pane of glass through which you flashed your light\nlast night, Bolton?\" asked the Doctor.\n\nThe detective touched one of the panes.\n\n\"Good,\" exclaimed the Doctor. \"I notice that this window has hooks for a\nwindow washer's belt. Get a life belt, will you?\"\n\nWhen the belt was brought, the Doctor turned to Carnes.\n\n\"Carnes,\" he said, \"hook on this life saver and climb out on the window\nledge. Take this piece of apparatus with you.\"\n\nHe handed Carnes a piece of apparatus which looked like two telescopes\nfastened to a base, with a screw adjustment for altering the angles of\nthe barrels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes took it and looked at it inquiringly.\n\n\"That is what I was making at the Bureau last night,\" explained Dr.\nBird. \"It is a device which will enable me to locate the source of the\nbeam which was reflected from this pane of glass onto the President's\npillow. I'll show you how to work it. You know that when light is\nreflected the angle of reflection always equals the angle of incidence?\nWell, you place these three feet against the pane of glass, thus putting\nthe base of the instrument in a plane parallel to the pane of glass. By\nturning these two knobs, one of which gives lateral and the other\nvertical adjustment, you will manipulate the instrument until the first\ntelescope is pointing directly toward the President's pillow. Now notice\nthat the two telescope barrels are fastened together and are connected\nto the knobs, so that when the knobs are turned, the scopes are turned\nin equal and opposite amounts. When one is turned from its present\nposition five degrees to the west, the other automatically turns five\ndegrees to the east. When one is elevated, the other is correspondingly\ndepressed. Thus, when the first tube points toward the pillow, the other\nwill point toward the source of the reflected beam.\"\n\n\"Clever!\" ejaculated Bolton.\n\n\"It is rather crude and may not be accurate enough to locate the source\nexactly, but at least it will give us a pretty good idea of where to\nlook. Given time, a much more accurate instrument could have been made,\nbut two telescopic rifle sights and a theodolite base were all the\nmaterials I could find to work with. Climb out, Carnesy, and do your\nstuff.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes climbed out on the window and fastened the hooks of the life\nsaver to the rings set in the window casings. He sat the base of the\ninstrument against the pane of glass and manipulated the telescope knobs\nas Dr. Bird signalled from the inside. The scientist was hard to please\nwith the adjustment, but at last the cross hairs of the first telescope\nwere centered on the light in the solarium. He changed his position and\nstared through the second tube.\n\n\"The angle is too acute and the distance too great for accuracy,\" he\nsaid with an air of disappointment. \"The beam comes from the roof of a\nhouse down along Pennsylvania Avenue, but I can't tell from here which\none it is. Take a look, Bolton.\"\n\nThe Chief of the Secret Service stared through the telescope.\n\n\"I couldn't be sure, Doctor,\" he replied. \"I can see something on the\nroof of one of the houses, but I can't tell what it is and I couldn't\ntell the house when I got in front of it.\"\n\n\"It won't do to make a false move,\" said the Doctor. \"Did you arrange\nfor that plane?\"\n\n\"It is waiting your orders at the field, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Good. I'll go up to the office of the Chief of Air Service and get in\ntouch with the pilot over the Chief's private line. There are some\norders that I wish to give him and some signals to be arranged.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird returned in a few minutes.\n\n\"The plane is taking off now and will be over the city soon,\" he\nannounced. \"We'll take a stroll down the Avenue until we are in the\nvicinity of the house, and then wait for the plane. Carnes will take\nfive of your men and go down behind the house and the rest of us will go\nin front. Which building do you think it is, Bolton?\"\n\n\"About the fourth from the corner.\"\n\n\"All right, the men going down the back will take station behind the\nhouse next to the corner and the rest of us will get in front of the\nsame building. When the plane comes over, watch it. If you receive no\nsignal, go to the next house and wait for him to make a loop and come\nover you again. Continue this until the pilot throws a white parachute\nover. That is the signal that we are covering the right house. When you\nget that signal, Carnes, leave two men outside and break in with the\nother three. Get that apparatus on the roof and the men who are\noperating it. Bolton and I will attack the front door at the same time.\nDoes everybody understand?\"\n\nMurmurs of assent came from the detail.\n\n\"All right, let's go. Carnes, lead out with your men and go half a block\nahead so that the two parties will arrive in position at about the same\ntime.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes left the building with five of the operatives. Dr. Bird and\nBolton waited for a few minutes and then started down Pennsylvania\nAvenue, the five men of their squad following at intervals. For\nthree-quarters of a mile they sauntered down the street.\n\n\"This should be it, Doctor,\" said Bolton.\n\n\"I think so, and here comes our plane.\"\n\nThey watched the swift scout plane from Langley Field swing down low\nover the house and then swoop up into the sky again without making a\nsignal. The party walked down the street one house and paused. Again the\nplane swept over them without sign. As they stopped in front of the next\nhouse a white parachute flew from the cockpit of the plane and the\naircraft, its mission accomplished, veered off to the south toward its\nhangar.\n\n\"This is the place,\" cried Bolton. \"Haggerty and Johnson, you two cover\nthe street. Bemis, take the lower door. The rest come with me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFollowed closely by Dr. Bird and two operatives, Bolton sprinted across\nthe street and up the steps leading to the main entrance of the house.\nThe door was barred, and he hurled his weight against it without result.\n\n\"One side, Bolton,\" snapped Dr. Bird.\n\nThe diminutive Chief drew aside and Dr. Bird's two hundred pounds of\nbone and muscle crashed against the door. The lock gave and the Doctor\nbarely saved himself from sprawling headlong on the hall floor. A\nwoman's scream rang out, and the Doctor swore under his breath.\n\n\"Upstairs! To the roof!\" he cried.\n\nFollowed by the rest of the party, he sprinted up the stairway which\nopened before him. Just as he reached the top his way was barred by an\nAmazonian figure in a green bathrobe.\n\n\"Who th' divil arre yer?\" demanded an outraged voice.\n\n\"Police,\" snapped Bolton. \"One side!\"\n\n\"Wan side, is it?\" demanded the fiery haired Amazon. \"The divil a stip\nye go until ye till me ye'er bizness. Phwat th' divil arre yer doin' in\nth' house uv a rayspictable female at this hour uv th' marnin'?\"\n\n\"One side, I tell you!\" cried Bolton as he strove to push past the\nfigure that barred the way.\n\n\"Oh, ye wud, wud yer, little mann?\" demanded the Irishwoman as she\ngrasped Bolton by the collar and shook him as a terrier does a rat. Dr.\nBird stifled his laughter with difficulty and seized her by the arm.\nWith a heave on Bolton's collar she raised him from the ground and swung\nhim against the Doctor, knocking him off his feet.\n\n\"Hilp! P'lice! Murther!\" she screamed at the top of her voice.\n\n\"Damn it, woman, we're on--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird's voice was cut short by the sound of a pistol shot from the\nroof, followed by two others. The Irishwoman dropped Bolton and slumped\ninto a sitting position and screamed lustily. Bolton and Dr. Bird, with\nthe two operatives at their heels, raced for the roof. Before they\nreached it another volley of shots rang out, these sounding from the\nrear of the building. They made their way to the upper floor and found a\nladder running to a skylight in the roof. At the foot of the ladder\nstood one of Carnes' party.\n\n\"What is it, Williams?\" demanded Bolton.\n\n\"I don't know, Chief. Carnes and the other two went up there, and then I\nheard shooting. My orders were to let no one come down the ladder.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Carnes' head appeared at the skylight.\n\n\"It's the right place, all right, Doctor,\" he called. \"Come on up, the\nshooting is all over.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird mounted the ladder and stepped out on the roof. Set on one edge\nwas a large piece of apparatus, toward which the scientist eagerly\nhastened. He bent over it for a few moments and then straightened up.\n\n\"Where is the operator?\" he asked.\n\nCarnes silently led the way to the edge of the roof and pointed down.\nDr. Bird leaned over. At the foot of the fire escape he saw a crumpled\ndark heap, with a secret service operative bending over it.\n\n\"Is he dead, Olmstead?\" called Carnes.\n\n\"Dead as a mackerel,\" came the reply. \"Richards got him through the head\non his first shot.\"\n\n\"Good business,\" said Dr. Bird. \"We probably could never have secured a\nconviction and the matter is best hushed up anyway. Bolton, have two of\nyour men help me get this apparatus up to the Bureau. I want to examine\nit a little. Have the body taken to the morgue and shut up the press.\nFind out which room the chap occupied and search it, and bring all his\npapers to me. From a criminal standpoint, this case is settled, but I\nwant to look into the scientific end of it a little more.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know what it was all about, Doctor,\" protested Bolton. \"I\nhave followed your lead blindly, and now I have a housebreaking without\nsearch-warrant and a killing to explain, and still I am about as much in\nthe dark as I was at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Bolton,\" said Dr. Bird contritely; \"I didn't mean to slight\nyou. Admiral Clay wants to know about it and so does Carnes, although he\nknows me too well to say so. As soon as I have digested the case I'll\nlet you know and I'll go over the whole thing with you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA week later Dr. Bird sat in conference with the President in the\nexecutive office of the White House. Beside him sat Admiral Clay, Carnes\nand Bolton.\n\n\"I have told the President as much as I know, Doctor,\" said the Admiral,\n\"and he would like to hear the details from your lips. He has fully\nrecovered from his malady and there is no danger of exciting him.\"\n\n\"I cannot read Russian,\" said Dr. Bird slowly, \"and so was forced to\ndepend on one of my assistants to translate the papers which Mr. Bolton\nfound in Stokowsky's room. There is nothing in them to definitely\nconnect him with the Russian Union of Soviet Republics, but there is\nlittle doubt in my mind that he was a Red agent and that Russia supplied\nthe money which he spent. It would be disastrous to Russia's plans to\nhave too close an accord between this country and the British Empire,\nand I have no doubt that the coming visit of Premier McDougal was the\nunderlying cause of the attempt. So much for the reason.\n\n\"As to how I came to suspect what was happening, the explanation is very\nsimple. When Carnes first told me of your malady, Mr. President, I\nhappened to be checking Von Beyer's results in the alleged discovery of\na new element, lunium. In the article describing his experiments, Von\nBeyer mentions that when he tried to observe the spectra, he encountered\na mild form of opthalmia which was quite stubborn to treatment. He also\nmentions a peculiar mental unbalance and intense exhilaration which the\nrays seemed to cause both in himself and in his assistants. The analogy\nbetween his observations and your case struck me at once.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"For ages the moon has been an object of worship by various religious\nsects, and some of the most obscene orgies of which we have record\noccurred in the moonlight. The full moon seems to affect dogs to a state\nof partial hypnosis with consequent howling and evident pain in the\neyes. Certain feeble minded persons have been known to be adversely\naffected by moonlight as well as some cases of complete mental\naberration. In other words, while moonlight has no practical effect on\nthe normal human in its usual concentration, it does have an adverse\neffect on certain types of mentality and, despite the laughter of\nmedical science, there seems to be something in the theory of 'moon\nmadness.' This effect Von Beyer attributed to the emanations of lunium,\nwhich element he detected in the spectra of the moon, in the form of a\nwide band in the ultra-violet region.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I obtained from Carnes a history of your case, and when I found that\nyour attacks grew violent with the full moon and subsided with the new\nmoon, I was sure that I was on the right track, although I had at that\ntime no way of knowing whether it was from natural or artificial causes\nthat the effect was being produced. I interviewed Admiral Clay and found\nthat you were suffering from a form of dermititis resembling sunburn,\nand that convinced me that an attack was being made on your sanity, for\nan excess of ultra-violet light will always tend to produce sunburn. I\ninquired about the windows of your solarium, for ultra-violet light will\nnot pass through a lead glass. When the Admiral told me that the glass\nhad been replaced with fused quartz, which is quite permeable to\nultra-violet and that the change had been almost coincident with the\nstart of your malady, I asked him to get you out of the solarium and let\nme examine it.\n\n\"By means of certain fluorescent substances which I used, I found that\nyour pillow was being bathed in a flood of ultra-violet light, and the\nfluoro-spectroscope soon told me that lunium emanations were present in\nlarge quantities. These rays were not coming to you directly from their\nsource, but one of the windows of the State, War and Navy Building was\nbeing used as a reflector. I located the approximate source of the ray\nby means of an improvised apparatus, and we surrounded the place.\nStokowsky was killed while attempting to escape. I guess that is about\nall there is to it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor,\" said the President. \"I would be interested in a\ndescription of the apparatus which he used to produce this effect.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The apparatus was quite simple, Sir. It was merely a large collector of\nmoonlight, which was thrown after collection onto a lunium plate. The\nresultant emanations were turned into a parallel beam by a parabolic\nreflector and focused, through a rock crystal lens with an extremely\nlong focal length, onto your pillow.\"\n\n\"Then Stokowsky had isolated Von Beyer's new element?\" asked the\nPresident.\n\n\"I am still in doubt whether it is a new element or merely an allotropic\nmodification of the common element, cadmium. The plate which he used has\na very peculiar property. When moonlight, or any other reflected light\nof the same composition falls on it, it acts on the ray much as the\nbutton of a Roentgen tube acts on a cathode ray. As the cathode ray is\nabsorbed and an entirely new ray, the X-ray, is given off by the button,\njust so is the reflected moonlight absorbed and a new ray of\nultra-violet given off. This is the ray which Von Beyer detected. I\nthought that I could catch traces of Von Beyer's lines in my\nspectroscope, and I think now that it is due to a trace of lunium in the\ncadmium plating of the barrels. Von Beyer could have easily made the\nsame mistake. Von Beyer's work, together with Stokowsky's opens up an\nentirely new field of spectroscopic research. I would give a good deal\nto go over to Baden and go into the matter with Von Beyer and make some\nplans for the exploitation of the new field, but I'm afraid that my\npocketbook wouldn't stand the trip.\"\n\n\"I think that the United States owes you that trip, Dr. Bird,\" said the\nChief Executive with a smile. \"Make your plans to go as soon as you get\nyour data together. I think that the Treasury will be able to take care\nof the expense without raising the income tax next year.\"\n\n\n       +------------------------------------------------------+\n       |                                                      |\n       |                 _IN THE NEXT ISSUE_                  |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                    Murder Madness                    |\n       |                                                      |\n       |  _Beginning an intensely Gripping, Four-Part Novel_  |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                _By_ MURRAY LEINSTER                  |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                  The Atom Smasher                    |\n       |                                                      |\n       |     _A Thrilling Adventure into Time and Space_      |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                _By_ VICTOR ROUSSEAU                  |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                                                      |\n       |               Into the Ocean's Depths                |\n       |                                                      |\n       |      _A Sequel to_ \"_From the Ocean's Depths_\"       |\n       |                                                      |\n       |              _By_ SEWELL PEASLEE WRIGHT              |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                 Brigands of the Moon                 |\n       |                                                      |\n       |          _Part Three of the Amazing Serial_          |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                  _By_ RAY CUMMINGS                   |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                                                      |\n       |                  ----_And Others!_                   |\n       |                                                      |\n       +------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _The Readers' Corner_\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_\nAstounding Stories]\n\n\n_Our Thanks_\n\nThree months ago the Clayton Magazines presented to lovers of Science\nFiction everywhere a new magazine with a brand-new policy--Astounding\nStories--and now it is the Editor's great pleasure to announce to our\nthousands of friends that this new magazine is enjoying a splendid\nsuccess.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours of the time that Astounding Stories was\nreleased for sale, letters of praise began pouring into our office,\nand--and this is significant--many of them clearly revealed that their\nwriters had grasped the essential difference of the new Science Fiction\nmagazine over the others.\n\nWe cannot better state this difference, this improvement, than by\nquoting what the Reader whose letter appears under the caption, \"And\nKind to Their Grandmothers,\" says in his very first paragraph: \"And I\nwas still more pleased, and surprised, to find that the Editor seems to\nknow that such stories should have real story interest, besides a\nscientific idea.\" It is exactly that. Every story that appears in\nAstounding Stories not only must contain some of the forecasted\nscientific achievements of To-morrow, but must be told vividly,\nexcitingly, with all the human interest that goes to make any story\nenjoyable To-day.\n\nThe Editor and staff of Astounding Stories express their sincere thanks\nto all who have contributed to our splendid start--especially to those\nwho had the kindness to write in with their helpful criticism.\n\nAlready one of your common suggestions has been taken up and embodied in\nour magazine, and so we have this new department, \"The Readers'\nCorner,\" which from now on will be an informal meeting place for all\nreaders of Astounding Stories. We want you never to forget that a\ncordial and perpetual invitation is extended to you to write in and talk\nover with all of us anything of interest you may have to say in\nconnection with our magazine.\n\nIf you can toss in a word of praise, that's fine; if only criticism,\nwe'll welcome that just as much, for we may be able to find from it a\nway to improve our magazine. If you have your own private theory of how\nairplanes will be run in 2500, or if you think the real Fourth Dimension\nis different from what it is sometimes described--write in and share\nyour views with all of us.\n\nThis department is all yours, and the job of running it and making it\ninteresting is largely up to you. So \"come over in 'The Readers'\nCorner'\" and have your share in what everyone will be saying.\n\n                                                       --_The Editor._\n\n\n\"_And Kind to Their Grandmothers!_\"\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  I received a pleasant surprise a few days ago when I found a new\n  Science Fiction magazine at the newsstand--Astounding Stories. And\n  I was still more pleased, and surprised, to find that the Editor\n  seems to know that such stories should have real story interest,\n  besides a scientific idea.\n\n  Of course I took with a grain of salt the invitation to write to\n  the editor and give my preference of the kind of stories I like. I\n  know that every editor, down in his heart, thinks his magazine is\n  perfect \"as is.\" In fact, praise is what they want, not\n  suggestions, judging by the letters they print.\n\n  Well, I can conscientiously give you some praise. If Astounding\n  Stories keep up to the standard of the first issue it will be all\n  right. Evidently you can afford to hire the best writers\n  obtainable. Notice you've signed up some of my favorites, Murray\n  Leinster, R. F. Starzl, Ray Cummings. I like their stuff because it\n  has the rare quality rather vaguely described as \"distinction,\"\n  which make the story remembered for a long time.\n\n  The story \"Tanks,\" by Murray Leinster, is my idea of what such a\n  story should be. The author does not start out, \"Listen, my\n  children, and you shall hear a story so wonderful you won't believe\n  it. Only after the death of Professor Bulging Dome do I dare to\n  make it public to a doubting world.\" No, he simply proceeds to tell\n  the story. If I were reading it in the Saturday Evening Post or\n  Ladies Home Journal it would be all right to prepare me for the\n  story by explaining that of course the author does not vouch for\n  the story, it having been told to him by a crazy Eurasian in a\n  Cottage Grove black-and-tan speakeasy at 3.30 A. M. In Astounding\n  Stories I expect the story to be unusual, so don't bother telling\n  me it is so. That criticism applies to \"Phantoms of Reality,\" which\n  is a story above the average, though, despite its rather flat title\n  and slow beginning.\n\n  Here's another good point about \"Tanks.\" Its characters are human.\n  Some authors of stories of the future make their characters all\n  brains--cold monsters, with no humanity in them. Such a story has\n  neither human interest nor plausibility. The sky's the limit, I\n  say, for mechanical or scientific accomplishments, but human\n  emotions will be the same a thousand years from now. And even\n  supposing that they will be changed, your readers have present day\n  emotions. The magazine can not prosper unless those present-day\n  emotions are aroused and mirrored by thoroughly human characters.\n  The situation may be just as outre as you like--the more unusual\n  the better--but it is the response of normal human emotions to most\n  unusual situations that gives a magazine such as yours its powerful\n  and unique \"kick.\"\n\n  The response of the two infantrymen in \"Tanks\" to the strange and\n  terrifying new warfare of the future exemplifies another point I\n  would like to make--the fact that no matter what marvels the future\n  may bring, the people who will live then will take them in a\n  matter-of-fact way. Their conversation will be cigarettes,\n  \"sag-paste,\" drinks, women. References to the scientific marvels\n  around them will be casual and sketchy. How many million words of\n  an average car owner's conversation would you have to report to\n  give a visitor from 1700 an idea of internal combustion engines?\n  The author, if skillful, can convey that information in other ways.\n  Yet a lot of stories printed have long, stilted conversations in\n  which the author thinks he is conveying in an entertaining way his\n  foundation situation. Personally, I like a lot of physical\n  action--violent action preferred. This is so, probably, because I'm\n  a school teacher and sedentary in my habits. I have never written a\n  story in my life, but I'm the most voracious consumer of stories in\n  Chicago. I like to see the hero get into a devil of a pickle, and\n  to have him smash his way out. I like 'em big, tough, and kind to\n  their grandmothers.\n\n  It seems to me that interplanetary stories offer the best vehicle\n  for all the desirable qualities herein enumerated combined. There\n  is absolutely no restraint on the imagination, except a few known\n  astronomical facts--plenty of opportunity for violent and dangerous\n  adventures, strange and terrestrially impossible monsters. The\n  human actors, set down in the midst of such terrifying conditions,\n  which they battle dauntlessly, grinning as they take their blows\n  and returning them with good will, cannot fail to rouse the\n  admiration of the reader. And make him buy the next month's issue.\n\n\n  But spare us, please the stories in which the hero, arriving on\n  some other planet, is admitted to the court of the king of the\n  White race, and leads their battles against the Reds, the Browns,\n  the Greens, and so on, eventually marrying the king's daughter, who\n  is always golden-haired, of milky white complexion, and has large\n  blue eyes. Kindly reject stories of interplanetary travel in which\n  a member of the party turns against the Earth party and allies\n  himself with the wormlike Moon men, or what have you. Stories in\n  which a great inventor gone crazy threatens to hurl the Earth into\n  the Sun leave me cold and despondent, for the simple reason that\n  crazy men are never great inventors. Name a great inventor who\n  wasn't perfectly sane, if you can. The author makes the great\n  inventor insane to make it plausible that he should want to destroy\n  the World. Well, if he is a good author he can find some other\n  motive.\n\n  One more thing. I like to smell, feel, hear and even taste the\n  action of a story as well as see it. Some authors only let you see\n  it, and then they don't tell you whether it's in bright or subdued\n  light. The author of \"Tanks\" fulfills my requirements in this\n  respect, at least partially.--Walter Boyle, c/o Mrs. Anna Treitz,\n  4751 North Artesian, Chicago, Ill.\n\n\n_A Permanent Reader_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  I want to thank you for the very entertaining hours I spent\n  perusing your new magazine, Astounding Stories. I read one or two\n  other Science Fiction magazines--it seems that tales of this sort\n  intrigue me. However, I wish to say that the debut number of your\n  magazine contained the best stories I ever read. Again thanking you\n  and assuring you that should the stories continue thus I will be a\n  permanent reader--Irving E. Ettinger, The Seville, Detroit, Mich.\n\n\n_We're Avoiding Reprints_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  I am well pleased with your new magazine and wish to offer you my\n  congratulations and best wishes. As I am well acquainted with most\n  of the Science Fiction now being written, I am in a good position\n  to criticize your magazine.\n\n  First: The cover illustration is good, but the inside drawings\n  could be greatly improved.\n\n  Second: Holding the magazine together with two staples is a good\n  idea.\n\n  Third: The paper could be improved.\n\n  Fourth: The price is right.\n\n  Here I classify the stories. Excellent: \"The Beetle Horde,\" and\n  \"Tanks.\" Very Good: \"Cave of Horror,\" \"Invisible Death,\" and\n  \"Phantoms of Reality.\" Medium: \"Compensation.\" Poor: \"Stolen Mind.\"\n\n  Please don't reprint any of Poe's, Wells', or Verne's works. My\n  prejudice to Verne, Wells and Poe is that I have read all their\n  works in other magazines.\n\n  However, with all my criticizing, I think that your magazine is a\n  good one.--James Nichols, 1509 19th Street, Bakersfield,\n  California.\n\n\n_Thanks, Mr. Marks!_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  I purchased a copy of \"our\" new magazine to-day and I think it\n  excellent. I am glad to see most of my old author friends\n  contributing for it, but how about looking up E. R. Burroughs,\n  David H. Keller, M. D., C. P. Wantenbacker and A. Merritt? They are\n  marvelous writers. I see Wesso did your cover and it is very good.\n  I have been a reader of four other Science Fiction monthly\n  magazines and two quarterlies, but I gladly take this one into my\n  fold and I think I speak for every other Science Fiction lover when\n  I say this. Which means, if true, that your publication will have\n  everlasting success. Here's hoping!--P. O. Marks, Jr., 893 York\n  Avenue, S. W., Atlanta, Ga.\n\n\n_A Fine Letter_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  Having read through the first number of Astounding Stories, my\n  enthusiasm has reached such a pitch that I find it difficult to\n  express myself adequately. A mere letter such as this can give\n  scarcely an inkling of the unbounded enjoyment I derive from the\n  pages of this unique magazine. To use a trite but appropriate\n  phrase, \"It fills a long-felt need.\" True, there are other\n  magazines which specialize in Science Fiction; but, to my mind they\n  are not in a class with Astounding Stories. In most of them the\n  scientific element is so emphasized that it completely overshadows\n  all else. In this magazine, happily, such is not the case. Here we\n  find science subordinated to human interest, which is as it should\n  be. The love element, too, is present and by no means unwelcome.\n\n  As for the literary quality of the stories, it could not be\n  improved on. Such craftsmen as Cummings, Leinster and Rousseau\n  never fail to turn out a vivid, well-written tale. If the stories in\n  the succeeding issues are on a par with those in the first, the\n  success of the magazine is assured.\n\n  By the way, your editorial explanation of Astounding Stories was a\n  gem. So many of us take our marvelous modern inventions for granted\n  that we never consider how miraculous they would seem to our\n  forebears. As you say, the only real difference between the\n  Astounding and the Commonplace is Time. A magazine such as\n  Astounding Stories enables us to anticipate the wonders of\n  To-morrow. Through its pages we can peer into the vistas of the\n  future and behold the world that is to be. Truly, you have given us\n  a rare treat--Allen Glasser, 931 Forest Ave., New York, N. Y.\n\n\n_The Science Correspondence Club Broadcasts_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  The other day I came upon Astounding Stories on our local\n  newsstand. I immediately procured a copy because Science Fiction\n  is my favorite pastime, so to speak. I was very much overjoyed that\n  another good Science Fiction magazine should come out, and a\n  Clayton Magazine too, which enhances its splendid value still\n  further. I have read various members of the Clayton family and I\n  found each of them entertaining.\n\n  After finishing the first issue, I decided to write in and express\n  my feelings. The stories were all good with the exception of \"The\n  Stolen Mind.\" Just keep printing stories by Cape, Meek, Ray\n  Cummings, Murray Leinster, C. V. Tench, Harl Vincent and R. F.\n  Starzl and I can predict now that your new venture will be a huge\n  success.\n\n  The main reason of this letter is to ask your help in putting over\n  Science Fiction Week. This will take place in the early part of\n  February, the week of the 5th or after. We want your co-operation\n  in making this a big success. You can help by running the attached\n  article upon the Science Correspondence Club in your \"Readers'\n  Corner.\" It will be a big aid.\n\n  I am sure, because you are the Editor of Astounding Stories, that\n  you will be pleased to help us in this venture. Science Fiction is\n  our common meeting ground and our common ideal.\n\n  I hope to have a Big Science Fiction Week with your help.--Conrad\n  H. Ruppert, 113 North Superior Street, Angola, Indiana.\n\n\n  To the Readers of Astounding Stories:\n\n  At the present there exists in the United States an organization\n  the purpose of which is to spread the gospel of Science and Science\n  Fiction, the Science Correspondence Club. I am writing this to\n  induce the readers of Astounding Stories to join us. After reading\n  this pick up your pen or take the cover from your typewriter and\n  send in an application for membership to our Secretary, Raymond A.\n  Palmer, 1431-38th St., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, or to our President,\n  Aubrey Clements, 6 South Hillard St., Montgomery, Alabama. They\n  will forward application blanks to you and you will belong to the\n  only organization in the world that is like it.\n\n  The Club was formed by twenty young men from all over the U. S. We\n  have a roll of almost 100, all over the world. Its expressed\n  purpose has been to help the cause of Science Fiction, and to\n  increase the knowledge of Science. It also affords the advantage of\n  being able to express your ideas in all fields.\n\n  The Preamble of the Constitution which we have worked out reads:\n  \"We, the members of this organization, in order to promote the\n  advancement of Science in general among laymen of the world through\n  the use of discussion and the creation and exchange of new ideas,\n  do ordain and establish this organization for the Science\n  Correspondence Club.\"\n\n  Article Two reads: \"The institution will remain an organization to\n  establish better co-ordination between the scientifically inclined\n  laymen of the world, regardless of sex, creed, color, or race.\n  There will be no restrictions as to age, providing the member can\n  pass an examination which shall be prepared by the membership\n  committee.\"\n\n  The Club will also publish a monthly bulletin, to which members may\n  contribute. It will also publish clippings, articles, etc., dealing\n  with science.\n\n  The membership will have no definite limit and the correspondence\n  will be governed by the wishes of each member.\n\n  Need more be said?\n\n  I almost forgot to say that we have two of the best Science Fiction\n  authors as active members, and three more who are doing their best,\n  but because of such work they cannot be active.\n\n  I hope my appeal bears fruit and that we shall hear from you\n  soon.--Conrad H. Ruppert.\n\n\n_But--Most Everybody Prefers the Smaller Size--and Price!_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  Last night I was passing a newsstand and saw your magazine. I\n  bought it then and there. I do not read any other stories except\n  the fantastic stories. Astounding Stories looks all right, but may\n  I make a suggestions? Why not increase the size of the magazine to\n  that of Miss 1900 or Forest and Stream? It would certainly look\n  better! You could also raise your price to twenty-five cents.\n  Please print as many stories as possible by the following authors:\n  Ray Cummings, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Murray Leinster, Edmond\n  Hamilton, A. Hyatt Verrill, Stanton A. Coblentz, Ed Earl Repp and\n  Harl Vincent.\n\n  My favorite type of story is the interplanetary one. I wish you the\n  best of luck in your new venture.--Stephen Takacs, 303 Eckford\n  Street, Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n\"_First Copy Wonderful_\"\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  I have read the first copy of Astounding Stories and think it\n  wonderful. I am very much interested in science fiction. I prefer\n  interplanetary stories and would like to see many of them in the\n  new magazine. Your authors are fine. The ones I like particularly\n  are Ray Cummings, Captain S. P. Meek, and Murray Leinster. I wonder\n  if I could subscribe to Astounding Stories? Will you let me know?\n  Good luck to the new magazine.--Donald Sisler, 3111 Adams Mill\n  Road, Washington, D. C.\n\n\n_Congratulations_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n  Allow me to congratulate you upon the starting of your new\n  magazine, Astounding Stories. Have just finished reading the first\n  issue and it is fine. While the class of stories that you publish\n  do not appeal to all, I feel quite sure that there are many like\n  myself who will welcome your publication and wish it all\n  success.--R. E. Norton, P. O.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
