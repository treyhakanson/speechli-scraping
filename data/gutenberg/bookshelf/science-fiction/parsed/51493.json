He\nknew from experience that it would make dark ghost suns swim in front\nof his eyes for a few moments, and that was mildly interesting. Then he\nslowly thrust his head out over the water, careful not to ruffle its\nsurface by rough breathing, and stared down at the mirror cat--the\nGummitch Double--staring up at him.\n\nGummitch had early discovered that water mirrors are very different\nfrom most glass mirrors. The scentless spirit world behind glass\nmirrors is an upright one sharing our gravity system, its floor a\ncontinuation of the floor in the so-called real world. But the world in\na water mirror has reverse gravity. One looks down into it, but the\nspirit-doubles in it look _up_ at one. In a way water mirrors are holes\nor pits in the world, leading down to a spirit infinity or ghostly\nnadir.\n\nGummitch had pondered as to whether, if he plunged into such a pit,\nhe would be sustained by the spirit gravity or fall forever. (It may\nwell be that speculations of this sort account for the caution about\nswimming characteristic of most cats.)\n\nThere was at least one exception to the general rule. The looking glass\non Kitty-Come-Here's dressing table also opened into a spirit world of\nreverse gravity, as Gummitch had discovered when he happened to look\ninto it during one of the regular visits he made to the dressing table\ntop, to enjoy the delightful flowery and musky odors emanating from the\nfragile bottles assembled there.\n\nBut exceptions to general rules, as Gummitch knew well, are only\ndoorways to further knowledge and finer classifications. The wind\ncould not get into the spirit world below Kitty-Come-Here's looking\nglass, while one of the definitive characteristics of water mirrors\nis that movement can very easily enter the spirit world below them,\nrhythmically disturbing it throughout, producing the most surreal\neffects, and even reducing it to chaos. Such disturbances exist only\nin the spirit world and are in no way a mirroring of anything in the\nreal world: Gummitch knew that his paw did not change when it flicked\nthe surface of the water, although the image of his paw burst into\na hundred flickering fragments. (Both cats and primitive men first\ndeduced that the world in a water mirror is a spirit world because they\nsaw that its inhabitants were easily blown apart by the wind and must\ntherefore be highly tenuous, though capable of regeneration.)\n\nGummitch mildly enjoyed creating rhythmic disturbances in the spirit\nworlds below water mirrors. He wished there were some way to bring\ntheir excitement and weird beauty into the real world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn this sunny day when our story begins, the spirit world below the\nwater mirror in his drinking bowl was particularly vivid and bright.\nGummitch stared for a while longer at the Gummitch Double and then\nthrust down his tongue to quench his thirst. Curling swiftly upward,\nit conveyed a splash of water into his mouth and also flicked a single\ndrop of water into the air before his nose. The sun struck the drop and\nit flashed like a diamond. In fact, it seemed to Gummitch that for a\nmoment he had juggled the sun on his tongue. He shook his head amazedly\nand touched the side of the bowl with his paw. The bowl was brimful\nand a few drops fell out; they also flashed like tiny suns as they\nfell. Gummitch had a fleeting vision, a momentary creative impulse,\nthat was gone from his mind before he could seize it. He shook his head\nonce more, backed away from the bowl, and then lay down with his head\npillowed on his paws to contemplate the matter. The room darkened as\nthe sun went under a cloud and the young golden dark-barred cat looked\nlike a pool of sunlight left behind.\n\nKitty-Come-Here had watched the whole performance from the door to the\ndining room and that evening she commented on it to Old Horsemeat.\n\n\"He backed away from the water as if it were poison,\" she said. \"They\nhave been putting more chlorine in it lately, you know, and maybe he\ncan taste the fluorides they put in for dental decay.\"\n\nOld Horsemeat doubted that, but his wife went on, \"I can't figure out\nwhere Gummitch does his drinking these days. There never seems to be\nany water gone from his bowl. And we haven't had any cut flowers. And\nnone of the faucets drip.\"\n\n\"He probably does his drinking somewhere outside,\" Old Horsemeat\nguessed.\n\n\"But he doesn't go outside very often these days,\" Kitty-Come-Here\ncountered. \"Scarface and the Mad Eunuch, you know. Besides, it hasn't\nrained for weeks. It's certainly a mystery to me where he gets his\nliquids. Boiling gets the chlorine out of water, doesn't it? I think\nI'll try him on some tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Maybe he's depressed,\" Old Horsemeat suggested. \"That often leads to\nsecret drinking.\"\n\nThis baroque witticism hit fairly close to the truth. Gummitch _was_\ndepressed--had been depressed ever since he had lost his kittenish\ndreams of turning into a man, achieving spaceflight, learning and\npublishing all the secrets of the fourth dimension, and similar\nmarvels. The black cloud of disillusionment at realizing he could only\nbe a cat had lightened somewhat, but he was still feeling dull and\nunfulfilled.\n\nGummitch was at that difficult age for he-cats, between First Puberty,\nwhen the cat achieves essential maleness, and Second Puberty, when he\ngets broad-chested, jowly and thick-ruffed, becoming a fully armed\nsexual competitor. In the ordinary course of things he would have been\nspending much of his time exploring the outer world, detail-mapping the\nimmediate vicinity, spying on other cats, making cautious approaches\nto unescorted females and in all ways comporting himself like a\nfledgling male. But this was prevented by the two burly toms who lived\nin the houses next door and who, far more interested in murder than the\npursuit of mates, had entered into partnership with the sole object of\nbushwacking Gummitch. Gummitch's household had nicknamed them Scarface\nand the Mad Eunuch, the latter being one of those males whom \"fixing\"\nturns, not placid, but homicidally maniacal. Compared to these seasoned\nheavyweights, Gummitch was a welterweight at most. Scarface and the Mad\nEunuch lay in wait for him by turns just beyond the kitchen door, so\nthat his forays into the outside world were largely reduced to dashes\nfor some hiding hole, followed by long, boring but perilous sieges.\n\nHe often wished that old Horsemeat's two older cats, Ashurbanipal and\nCleopatra, had not gone to the country to live with Old Horsemeat's\nmother. They would have shown the evil bushwackers a thing or two!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBecause of Scarface and the Mad Eunuch, Gummitch spent most of his\ntime indoors. Since a cat is made for a half-and-half existence--half\nin the wild forest, half in the secure cave--he took to brooding quite\nmorbidly. He thought over-much of ghost cats in the mirror world\nand of the Skeleton Cat who starved to death in a locked closet and\nsimilar grisly legends. He immersed himself in racial memories, not so\nmuch of Ancient Egypt where cats were prized as minions of the lovely\ncat-goddess Bast and ceremoniously mummified at the end of tranquil\nlives, as of the Middle Ages, when European mankind waged a genocidal\nwar against felines as being the familiars of witches. (He thought\nbriefly of turning Kitty-Come-Here into a witch, but his hypnotic\nstaring and tentative ritualistic mewing only made her fidgety.) And he\ndevoted more and more time to devising dark versions of the theory of\ntransmigration, picturing cats as Silent Souls, Gagged People of Great\nTalent, and the like.\n\nHe had become too self-conscious to re-enter often the make-believe\nworld of the kitten, yet his imagination remained as active as ever. It\nwas a truly frustrating predicament.\n\nMore and more often and for longer periods he retired to meditate in\na corrugated cardboard shoebox, open only at one end. The cramped\nquarters made it easier for him to think. Old Horsemeat called it the\nCat Orgone Box after the famed Orgone Energy Accumulators of the late\nwildcat psychoanalyst Dr. Wilhelm Reich.\n\nIf only, Gummitch thought, he could devise some way of objectifying\nthe intimations of beauty that flitted through his darkly clouded\nmind! Now, on the evening of the sunny day when he had backed away\nfrom his water bowl, he attacked the problem anew. He knew he had been\nfleetingly on the verge of a great idea, an idea involving water, light\nand movement. An idea he had unfortunately forgotten. He closed his\neyes and twitched his nose. I must concentrate, he thought to himself,\nconcentrate....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext day Kitty-Come-Here remembered her idea about Gummitch's water.\nShe boiled two cupfuls in a spotless enamelware saucepan, letting\nit cool for half an hour before using it to replace the seemingly\noffensive water in the young cat's bowl. It was only then she noticed\nthat the bowl had been upset.\n\nShe casually assumed that big-footed Old Horsemeat must have\nbeen responsible for the accident, or possibly one of the two\nchildren--darting Sissy or blundering Baby. She wiped the bowl and\nfilled it with the water she had dechlorinated.\n\n\"Come here, Kitty, come here,\" she called to Gummitch, who had been\nwatching her actions attentively from the dining room door. The young\ncat stayed where he was. \"Oh, well, if you want to be coy,\" she said,\nshrugging her shoulders.\n\nThere was a mystery about the spilled water. It had apparently\ndisappeared entirely, though the day seemed hardly dry enough for total\nevaporation. Then she saw it standing in a puddle by the wall fully ten\nfeet away from the bowl. She made a quick deduction and frowned a bit\nworriedly.\n\n\"I never realized the kitchen floor sloped _that_ much,\" she told Old\nHorsemeat after dinner. \"Maybe some beams need to be jacked up in\nthe basement. I'd hate to think of collapsing into it while I cooked\ndinner.\"\n\n\"I'm sure this house finished all its settling thirty years ago,\" her\nhusband assured her hurriedly. \"That slope's always been there.\"\n\n\"Well, if you say so,\" Kitty-Come-Here allowed doubtfully.\n\nNext day she found Gummitch's bowl upset again and the remains of the\nboiled water in a puddle across the room. As she mopped it up, she\nbegan to do some thinking without benefit of Concentration Box.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat evening, after Old Horsemeat and Sissy had vehemently denied\nkicking into the water bowl or stepping on its edge, she voiced her\nconclusions. \"I think _Gummitch_ upsets it,\" she said. \"He's rejecting\nit. It still doesn't taste right to him and he wants to show us.\"\n\n\"Maybe he only likes it after it's run across the floor and got\nseasoned with household dust and the corpses of germs,\" suggested Old\nHorsemeat, who believed most cats were bohemian types.\n\n\"I'll have you know I _scrub_ that linoleum,\" Kitty-Come-Here asserted.\n\n\"Well, with detergent and scouring powder, then,\" Old Horsemeat amended\nresourcefully.\n\nKitty-Come-Here made a scornful noise. \"I still want to know where he\ngets his liquids,\" she said. \"He's been off milk for weeks, you know,\nand he only drinks a little broth when I give him that. Yet he doesn't\nseem dehydrated. It's a real mystery and--\"\n\n\"Maybe he's built a still in the attic,\" Old Horsemeat interjected.\n\n\"--and I'm going to find the answers,\" Kitty-Come-Here concluded,\nignoring the facetious interruption. \"I'm going to find out _where_\nhe gets the water he does drink and _why_ he rejects the water I give\nhim. This time I'm going to boil it and put in a pinch of salt. Just a\npinch.\"\n\n\"You make animals sound more delicate about food and drink than\nhumans,\" Old Horsemeat observed.\n\n\"They probably are,\" his wife countered. \"For one thing they don't\nsmoke, or drink Martinis. It's my firm belief that animals--cats,\nanyway--like good food just as much as we do. And the same sort of good\nfood. They don't enjoy canned catfood any more than we would, though\nthey _can_ eat it. Just as we could if we had to. I really don't think\nGummitch would have such a passion for raw horsemeat except you started\nhim on it so early.\"\n\n\"He probably thinks of it as steak tartare,\" Old Horsemeat said.\n\nNext day Kitty-Come-Here found her salted offering upset just as the\ntwo previous bowls had been.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch were the beginnings of the Great Spilled Water Mystery that\npreoccupied the human members of the Gummitch household for weeks. Not\nevery day, but frequently, and sometimes two and three times a day,\nGummitch's little bowl was upset. No one ever saw the young cat do it.\nBut it was generally accepted that he was responsible, though for a\ntime Old Horsemeat had theories that he did not voice involving Sissy\nand Baby.\n\nKitty-Come-Here bought Gummitch a firm-footed rubber bowl for his\nwater, though she hesitated over the purchase for some time, certain he\nwould be able to taste the rubber. This bowl was found upset just like\nhis regular china one and like the tin one she briefly revived from his\nkitten days.\n\nAll sorts of clues and possibly related circumstances were seized upon\nand dissected. For instance, after about a month of the mysterious\nspillings, Kitty-Come-Here announced, \"I've been thinking back and as\nfar as I can remember it never happens except on sunny days.\"\n\n\"Oh, Good Lord!\" Old Horsemeat reacted.\n\nMeanwhile Kitty-Come-Here continued to try to concoct a kind of water\nthat would be palatable to Gummitch. As she continued without success,\nher formulas became more fantastic. She quit boiling it for the most\npart but added a pinch of sugar, a spoonful of beer, a few flakes of\noregano, a green leaf, a violet, a drop of vanilla extract, a drop of\niodine....\n\n\"No wonder he rejects the stuff,\" Old Horsemeat was tempted to say, but\ndidn't.\n\nFinally Kitty-Come-Here, inspired by the sight of a greenly glittering\nrack of it at the supermarket, purchased a half gallon of bottled water\nfrom a famous spring. She wondered why she hadn't thought of this step\nearlier--it certainly ought to take care of her haunting convictions\nabout the unpalatableness of chlorine or fluorides. (She herself could\ndistinctly taste the fluorides in the tap water, though she never\nmentioned this to Old Horsemeat.)\n\nOne other development during the Great Spilled Water Mystery was that\nGummitch gradually emerged from depression and became quite gay. He\ntook to dancing cat schottisches and gigues impromptu in the living\nroom of an evening and so forgot his dignity as to battle joyously with\nthe vacuum-cleaner dragon when Old Horsemeat used one of the smaller\nattachments to curry him; the young cat clutched the hairy round brush\nto his stomach and madly clawed it as it _whuffled_ menacingly. Even\nthe afternoon he came home with a shoulder gashed by the Mad Eunuch he\nseemed strangely light-hearted and debonair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Mystery was abruptly solved one sunny Sunday afternoon. Going\ninto the bathroom in her stocking feet, Kitty-Come-Here saw Gummitch\napparently trying to drown himself in the toilet. His hindquarters were\non the seat but the rest of his body went down into the bowl. Coming\ncloser, she saw that his forelegs were braced against the opposite\nside of the bowl, just above the water surface, while his head thrust\ndown sharply between his shoulders. She could distinctly hear rhythmic\nlapping.\n\nTo tell the truth, Kitty-Come-Here was rather shocked. She had certain\nrather fixed ideas about the delicacy of cats. It speaks well for her\nprogressive grounding that she did not shout at Gummitch but softly\nsummoned her husband.\n\nBy the time Old Horsemeat arrived the young cat had refreshed himself\nand was coming out of his \"well\" with a sudden backward undulation. He\npassed them in the doorway with a single mew and upward look and then\nmade off for the kitchen.\n\nThe blue and white room was bright with sunlight. Outside the sky was\nblue and the leaves were rustling in a stiff breeze. Gummitch looked\nback once, as if to make sure his human congeners had followed, mewed\nagain, and then advanced briskly toward his little bowl with the air of\none who proposes to reveal all mysteries at once.\n\nKitty-Come-Here had almost outdone herself. She had for the first time\npoured him the bottled water, and she had floated a few rose petals on\nthe surface.\n\nGummitch regarded them carefully, sniffed at them, and then proceeded\nto fish them out one by one and shake them off his paw. Old Horsemeat\nrepressed the urge to say, \"I told you so.\"\n\nWhen the water surface was completely free and winking in the sunlight,\nGummitch curved one paw under the side of the bowl and jerked.\n\nHalf the water spilled out, gathered itself, and then began to flow\nacross the floor in little rushes, a silver ribbon sparkling with\nsunlight that divided and subdivided and reunited as it followed the\nslope. Gummitch crouched to one side, watching it intensely, following\nits progress inch by inch and foot by foot, almost pouncing on the\nlittle temporary pools that formed, but not quite touching them. Twice\nhe mewed faintly in excitement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He's _playing_ with it,\" Old Horsemeat said incredulously.\n\n\"No,\" Kitty-Come-Here countered wide-eyed, \"he's _creating_ something.\nSilver mice. Water-snakes. Twinkling vines.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, you're right,\" Old Horsemeat agreed. \"It's a new art form.\nWould you call it water painting? Or water sculpture? Somehow I think\nthat's best. As if a sculptor made mobiles out of molten tin.\"\n\n\"It's gone so quickly, though,\" Kitty-Come-Here objected, a little\nsadly. \"Art ought to last. Look, it's almost all flowed over to the\nwall now.\"\n\n\"Some of the best art forms are completely fugitive,\" Old Horsemeat\nargued. \"What about improvisation in music and dancing? What about\njam sessions and shadow figures on the wall? Gummitch can always do\nit again--in fact, he must have been doing it again and again this\nlast month. It's never exactly the same, like waves or fires. But it's\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Kitty-Come-Here said. Then coming to herself, she\ncontinued, \"But I don't think it can be healthy for him to go on\ndrinking water out of the toilet. Really.\"\n\nOld Horsemeat shrugged. He had an insight about the artistic\ntemperament and the need to dig for inspiration into the smelly\nfundamentals of life, but it was difficult to express delicately.\n\nKitty-Come-Here sighed, as if bidding farewell to all her efforts with\nrose petals and crystalline bottled purity and vanilla extract and the\nsoda water which had amazed Gummitch by faintly spitting and purring at\nhim.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" she said, \"I can scrub it out more often, I suppose.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gummitch had gone back to his bowl and, using both paws,\noverset it completely. Now, nose a-twitch, he once more pursued the\nsilver streams alive with suns, refreshing his spirit with the sight\nof them. He was fretted by no problems about what he was doing. He had\nsolved them all with one of his characteristically sharp distinctions:\nthere was the _sacred_ water, the sparklingly clear water to create\nwith, and there was the water with character, the water to _drink_.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Kreativity For Kats, by Fritz Leiber\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KREATIVITY FOR KATS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51493.txt or 51493.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/4/9/51493/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
