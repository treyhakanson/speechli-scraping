M. KORNBLUTH\n\n                          Illustrated by WOOD\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n           Galaxy Science Fiction October and November 1957.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n             Appallingly, the Earth and the Moon had been\n             kidnapped from the Solar System--but who were\n             the kidnappers and what ransom did they want?\n\n\nI\n\nRoget Germyn, banker, of Wheeling, West Virginia, a Citizen, woke\ngently from a Citizen's dreamless sleep. It was the third-hour-rising\ntime, the time proper to a day of exceptional opportunity to appreciate.\n\nCitizen Germyn dressed himself in the clothes proper for the\nappreciation of great works--such as viewing the Empire State ruins\nagainst storm clouds from a small boat, or walking in silent single\nfile across the remaining course of the Golden Gate Bridge. Or as\ntoday--one hoped--witnessing the Re-creation of the Sun.\n\nGermyn with difficulty retained a Citizen's necessary calm. One was\ntempted to meditate on improper things: Would the Sun be re-created?\nWhat if it were not?\n\nHe put his mind to his dress. First of all, he put on an old and\nstoried bracelet, a veritable identity bracelet of heavy silver links\nand a plate which was inscribed:\n\n                           PFC JOE HARTMANN\n                                _Korea_\n                                 1953\n\nHis fellow jewelry-appreciators would have envied him that bracelet--if\nthey had been capable of such an emotion as envy. No other ID bracelet\nas much as two hundred and fifty years old was known to exist in\nWheeling.\n\nHis finest shirt and pair of light pants went next to his skin,\nand over them he wore a loose parka whose seams had been carefully\nweakened. When the Sun was re-created, every five years or so, it was\nthe custom to remove the parka gravely and rend it with the prescribed\ngraceful gestures ... but not so drastically that it could not be\nstitched together again. Hence the weakened seams.\n\nThis was, he counted, the forty-first day on which he and all of\nWheeling had donned the appropriate Sun Re-creation clothing. It was\nthe forty-first day on which the Sun--no longer white, no longer\nblazing yellow, no longer even bright red--had risen and displayed a\ncolor that was darker maroon and always darker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had, thought Citizen Germyn, never grown so dark and so cold in all\nof his life. Perhaps it was an occasion for special viewing. For surely\nit would never come again, this opportunity to see the old Sun so near\nto death....\n\nOne hoped.\n\nGravely, Citizen Germyn completed his dressing, thinking only of\nthe act of dressing itself. It was by no means his specialty, but\nhe considered, when it was done, that he had done it well, in the\ntraditional flowing gestures, with no flailing, at all times balanced\nlightly on the ball of the foot. It was all the more perfectly\nconsummated because no one saw it but himself.\n\nHe woke his wife gently, by placing the palm of his hand on her\nforehead as she lay neatly, in the prescribed fashion, on the Woman's\nThird of the bed.\n\nThe warmth of his hand gradually penetrated the layers of sleep. Her\neyes demurely opened.\n\n\"Citizeness Germyn,\" he greeted her, making the assurance-of-identity\nsign with his left hand.\n\n\"Citizen Germyn,\" she said, with the assurance-of-identity inclination\nof the head which was prescribed when the hands are covered.\n\nHe retired to his tiny study.\n\nIt was the time appropriate to meditation on the properties of\nConnectivity. Citizen Germyn was skilled in meditation, even for a\nbanker; it was a grace in which he had schooled himself since earliest\nchildhood.\n\nCitizen Germyn, his young face composed, his slim body erect as he\nsat but in no way tense or straining, successfully blanked out, one\nafter another, all of the external sounds and sights and feelings that\ninterfered with proper meditation. His mind was very nearly vacant\nexcept of one central problem: Connectivity.\n\nOver his head and behind, out of sight, the cold air of the room seemed\nto thicken and form a--call it a blob; a blob of air.\n\nThere was a name for those blobs of air. They had been seen before.\nThey were a known fact of existence in Wheeling and in all the world.\nThey came. They hovered. And they went away--sometimes not alone. If\nsomeone had been in the room with Citizen Germyn to look at it, he\nwould have seen a distortion, a twisting of what was behind the blob,\nlike flawed glass, a lens, like an eye. And they were called Eye.\n\nGermyn meditated.\n\nThe blob of air grew and slowly moved. A vagrant current that spun out\nfrom it caught a fragment of paper and whirled it to the floor. Germyn\nstirred. The blob retreated.\n\nGermyn, all unaware, disciplined his thoughts to disregard the\ninterruption, to return to the central problem of Connectivity. The\nblob hovered....\n\nFrom the other room, his wife's small, thrice-repeated throat-clearing\nsignaled to him that she was dressed. Germyn got up to go to her, his\nmind returning to the world; and the overhead Eye spun relentlessly,\nand disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome miles east of Wheeling, Glenn Tropile--of a class which found it\nwisest to give itself no special name, and which had devoted much time\nand thought to shaking the unwelcome name it had been given--awoke on\nthe couch of his apartment.\n\nHe sat up, shivering. It was cold. The damned Sun was still bloody dark\noutside the window and the apartment was soggy and chilled.\n\nHe had kicked off the blankets in his sleep. _Why couldn't_ he learn\nto sleep quietly, like anybody else? Lacking a robe, he clutched the\nblankets around him, got up and walked to the unglassed window.\n\nIt was not unusual for Glenn Tropile to wake up on his couch. This\nhappened because Gala Tropile had a temper, was inclined to exile\nhim from her bed after a quarrel, and--the operative factor--he knew\nhe always had the advantage over her for the whole day following the\nnight's exile. Therefore the quarrel was worth it. An advantage was, by\ndefinition, worth anything you paid for it or else it was no advantage.\n\nHe could hear her moving about in one of the other rooms and cocked an\near, satisfied. She hadn't waked him. Therefore she was about to make\namends. A little itch in his spine or his brain--it was not a physical\nitch, so he couldn't locate it; he could only be sure that it was\nthere--stopped troubling him momentarily; he was winning a contest. It\nwas Glenn Tropile's nature to win contests ... and his nature to create\nthem.\n\nGala Tropile, young, dark, attractive, with a haunted look, came in\ntentatively carrying coffee from some secret hoard of hers.\n\nGlenn Tropile affected not to notice. He stared coldly out at the cold\nlandscape. The sea, white with thin ice, was nearly out of sight, so\nfar had it retreated as the little sun waned.\n\n\"Glenn--\"\n\nAh, good! _Glenn._ Where was the proper mode of\nfirst-greeting-one's-husband? Where was the prescribed throat-clearing\nupon entering a room?\n\nAssiduously, he had untaught her the meticulous ritual of manners that\nthey had all of them been brought up to know; and it was the greatest\nof his many victories over her that sometimes, now, _she_ was the\naggressor, _she_ would be the first to depart from the formal behavior\nprescribed for Citizens.\n\nDepravity! Perversion!\n\nSometimes they would touch each other at times which were not the\nappropriate coming-together times, Gala sitting on her husband's lap in\nthe late evening, perhaps, or Tropile kissing her awake in the morning.\nSometimes he would force her to let him watch her dress--no, not now,\nfor the cold of the waning sun made that sort of frolic unattractive,\nbut she had permitted it before; and such was his mastery over her that\nhe knew she would permit it again, when the Sun was re-created....\n\nIf, a thought came to him, _if_ the Sun was re-created.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned away from the cold outside and looked at his wife. \"Good\nmorning, darling.\" She was contrite.\n\nHe demanded jarringly: \"Is it?\" Deliberately he stretched, deliberately\nhe yawned, deliberately he scratched his chest. Every movement was\nugly. Gala Tropile quivered, but said nothing.\n\nTropile flung himself on the better of the two chairs, one hairy leg\nprotruding from under the wrapped blankets. His wife was on her best\nbehavior--in his unique terms; she didn't avert her eyes.\n\n\"What've you got there?\" he asked. \"Coffee?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear. I thought--\"\n\n\"Where'd you get it?\"\n\nThe haunted eyes looked away. Still better, thought Glenn Tropile,\nmore satisfied even than usual; she's been ransacking an old warehouse\nagain. It was a trick he had taught her, and like all of the illicit\ntricks she had learned from him, a handy weapon when he chose to use it.\n\nIt was not prescribed that a Citizen should rummage through Old Places.\nA Citizen did his work, whatever that work might be--banker, baker or\nfurniture repairman. He received what rewards were his due for the work\nhe did. A Citizen _never_ took anything that was not his due--not even\nif it lay abandoned and rotting.\n\nIt was one of the differences between Glenn Tropile and the people he\nmoved among.\n\nI've got it made, he exulted; it was what I needed to clinch my victory\nover her.\n\nHe spoke: \"I need you more than I need coffee, Gala.\"\n\nShe looked up, troubled.\n\n\"What would I do,\" he demanded, \"if a beam fell on you one day while\nyou were scrambling through the fancy groceries? How can you take such\nchances? Don't you _know_ what you mean to me?\"\n\nShe sniffed a couple of times. She said brokenly: \"Darling, about last\nnight--I'm sorry--\" and miserably held out the cup. He took it and set\nit down. He took her hand, looked up at her, and kissed it lingeringly.\nHe felt her tremble. Then she gave him a wild, adoring look and flung\nherself into his arms.\n\nA new dominance cycle was begun at the moment he returned her frantic\nkisses.\n\nGlenn knew, and Gala knew, that he had over her an edge, an\nadvantage--the weather gauge, initiative of fire, percentage, the\ncan't-lose lack of tension. Call it anything, but it was life itself to\nsuch as Glenn Tropile. He knew, and she knew, that having the advantage\nhe would press it and she would yield--on and on, in a rising spiral.\n\nHe did it because it was his life, the attaining of an advantage over\nanyone he might encounter; because he was (unwelcomely but justly)\ncalled a Son of the Wolf.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA world away, a Pyramid squatted sullenly on the planed-off top of the\nhighest peak of the Himalayas.\n\nIt had not been built there. It had not been carried there by Man or\nMan's machines. It had--come, in its own time; for its own reasons.\n\nDid it wake on that day, the thing atop Mount Everest, or did it\never sleep? Nobody knew. It stood, or sat, there, approximately a\ntetrahedron. Its appearance was known: constructed on a base line of\nsome thirty-five yards, slaggy, midnight-blue in color. Almost nothing\nelse about it was known--at least, to mankind.\n\nIt was the only one of its kind on Earth, though men thought (without\nmuch sure knowledge) that there were more, perhaps many thousands more,\nlike it on the unfamiliar planet that was Earth's binary, swinging\naround the miniature Sun that hung at their common center of gravity\nlike an unbalanced dumbbell. But men knew very little about that planet\nitself, only that it had come out of space and was now there.\n\nTime was when men had tried to label that binary, more than two\ncenturies before, when it had first appeared. \"Runaway Planet.\" \"The\nInvader.\" \"Rejoice in Messias, the Day Is at Hand.\" The labels were\nsense-free; they were Xs in an equation, signifying only that there was\n_something_ there which was unknown.\n\n\"The Runaway Planet\" stopped running when it closed on Earth.\n\n\"The Invader\" didn't invade; it merely sent down one slaggy,\nmidnight-blue tetrahedron to Everest.\n\nAnd \"Rejoice in Messias\" stole Earth from its sun--with Earth's old\nmoon, which it converted into a miniature sun of its own.\n\nThat was the time when men were plentiful and strong--or thought they\nwere--with many huge cities and countless powerful machines. It didn't\nmatter. The new binary planet showed no interest in the cities or the\nmachines.\n\nThere was a plague of things like Eyes--dust-devils without dust,\nmotionless air that suddenly tensed and quivered into lenticular\nshapes. They came with the planet and the Pyramid, so that there\nprobably was some connection. But there was nothing to do about the\nEyes. Striking at them was like striking at air--was the same thing, in\nfact.\n\nWhile the men and machines tried uselessly to do something about it,\nthe new binary system--the stranger planet and Earth--began to move,\naccelerating very slowly.\n\nBut accelerating.\n\nIn a week, astronomers knew something was happening. In a month, the\nMoon sprang into flame and became a new sun--beginning to be needed,\nfor already the parent Sol was visibly more distant, and in a few years\nit was only one other star among many.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the little sun was burned to a clinker, they--whoever \"they\"\nwere, for men saw only the one Pyramid--would hang a new one in the\nsky. It happened every five clock-years, more or less. It was the same\nold moon-turned-sun, but it burned out, and the fires needed to be\nrekindled.\n\nThe first of these suns had looked down on an Earthly population of ten\nbillion. As the sequence of suns waxed and waned, there were changes,\nclimatic fluctuation, all but immeasurable differences in the quantity\nand kind of radiation from the new source.\n\nThe changes were such that the forty-fifth such sun looked down on a\nshrinking human race that could not muster up a hundred million.\n\nA frustrated man drives inward; it is the same with a race. The\nhundred million that clung to existence were not the same as the bold,\nvital ten billion.\n\nThe thing on Everest had, in its time, received many labels, too: The\nDevil, The Friend, The Beast, A Pseudo-living Entity of Quite Unknown\nElectrochemical Properties.\n\nAll these labels were also Xs.\n\nIf it did wake that morning, it did not open its eyes, for it had no\neyes--apart from the quivers of air that might or might not belong\nto it. Eyes might have been gouged; therefore it had none. So an\nillogical person might have argued--and yet it was tempting to apply\nthe \"purpose, not function\" fallacy to it. Limbs could be crushed; it\nhad no limbs. Ears could be deafened; it had none. Through a mouth, it\nmight be poisoned; it had no mouth. Intentions and actions could be\nfrustrated; apparently it had neither.\n\nIt was there. That was all.\n\nIt and others like it had stolen the Earth and the Earth did not know\nwhy. It was there. And the one thing on Earth you could not do was hurt\nit, influence it, or coerce it in any way whatever.\n\nIt was there--and it, or the masters it represented, owned the Earth by\nright of theft. Utterly. Beyond human hope of challenge or redress.\n\n\nII\n\nCitizen and Citizeness Roget Germyn walked down Pine Street in the\nchill and dusk of--one hoped--a Sun Re-creation Morning.\n\nIt was the convention to pretend that this was a morning like any other\nmorning. It was not proper either to cast frequent hopeful glances at\nthe sky, nor yet to seem disturbed or afraid because this was, after\nall, the forty-first such morning since those whose specialty was Sky\nViewing had come to believe the Re-creation of the Sun was near.\n\nThe Citizen and his Citizeness exchanged the assurance-of-identity\nsign with a few old friends and stopped to converse. This also was a\nconvention of skill divorced from purpose. The conversation was without\nrelevance to anything that any one of the participants might know, or\nthink, or wish to ask.\n\nGermyn said for his friends a twenty-word poem he had made in honor\nof the occasion and heard their responses. They did line-capping for\na while--until somebody indicated unhappiness and a wish to change by\nfrowning the Two Grooves between his brows. The game was deftly ended\nwith an improvised rhymed exchange.\n\nCasually, Citizen Germyn glanced aloft. The sky-change had not begun\nyet; the dying old Sun hung just over the horizon, east and south, much\nmore south than east. It was an ugly thought, but suppose, thought\nGermyn, just _suppose_ that the Sun were not re-created today? Or\ntomorrow. Or--\n\nOr ever.\n\nThe Citizen got a grip on himself and told his wife: \"We shall dine at\nthe oatmeal stall.\"\n\nThe Citizeness did not immediately reply. When Germyn glanced at her\nwith well-masked surprise, he found her almost staring down the dim\nstreet at a Citizen who moved almost in a stride, almost swinging his\narms. Scarcely graceful.\n\n\"That might be more Wolf than man,\" she said doubtfully.\n\nGermyn knew the fellow. Tropile was his name. One of those curious few\nwho made their homes outside of Wheeling, though they were not farmers.\nGermyn had had banking dealings with him--or would have had, if it had\nbeen up to Tropile.\n\n\"That is a careless man,\" he decided, \"and an ill-bred one.\"\n\nThey moved toward the oatmeal stall with the gait of Citizens, arms\nlimp, feet scarcely lifted, slumped forward a little. It was the\nancient gait of fifteen hundred calories per day, not one of which\ncould be squandered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a need for more calories. So many for walking, so many for\ngathering food. So many for the economical pleasures of the Citizens,\nso many more--oh, many more, these days!--to keep out the cold. Yet\nthere were no more calories; the diet the whole world lived on was a\nbare subsistence diet.\n\nIt was impossible to farm well when half the world's land was part\nof the time drowned in the rising sea, part of the time smothered in\nfalling snow.\n\nCitizens knew this and, knowing, did not struggle--it was ungraceful\nto struggle, particularly when one could not win. Only--well, Wolves\nstruggled, wasting calories, lacking grace.\n\nCitizen Germyn turned his mind to more pleasant things.\n\nHe allowed himself his First Foretaste of the oatmeal. It would be\nwarm in the bowl, hot in the throat, a comfort in the belly. There was\na great deal of pleasure there, in weather like this, when the cold\nplucked through the loosened seams and the wind came up the sides of\nthe hills. Not that there wasn't pleasure in the cold itself, for that\nmatter. It was proper that one should be cold now, just before the\nre-creation of the Sun, when the old Sun was smoky-red and the new one\nnot yet kindled.\n\n\"--still looks like Wolf to me,\" his wife was muttering.\n\n\"Cadence,\" Germyn reproved his Citizeness, but took the sting out of it\nwith a Quirked Smile.\n\nThe man with the ugly manners was standing at the very bar of the\noatmeal stall where they were heading. In the gloom of mid-morning, he\nwas all angles and strained lines. His head was turned awkwardly on\nhis shoulder, peering toward the back of the stall where the vendor\nwas rhythmically measuring grain into a pot. His hands were resting\nhelter-skelter on the counter, not hanging by his sides.\n\nCitizen Germyn felt a faint shudder from his wife. But he did not\nreprove her again, for who could blame her? The exhibition was\nrevolting.\n\nShe said faintly: \"Citizen, might we dine on bread this morning?\"\n\nHe hesitated and glanced again at the ugly man. He said indulgently,\nknowing that he was indulgent: \"On Sun Re-creation Morning, the\nCitizeness may dine on bread.\" Bearing in mind the occasion, it was\nonly a small favor and therefore a very proper one.\n\nThe bread was good, very good. They shared out the half-kilo between\nthem and ate it in silence, as it deserved. Germyn finished his first\nportion and, in the prescribed pause before beginning his second,\nelected to refresh his eyes upward.\n\nHe nodded to his wife and stepped outside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOverhead, the Old Sun parceled out its last barrel-scrapings of heat.\nIt was larger than the stars around it, but many of them were nearly as\nbright.\n\nA high-pitched male voice said: \"Citizen Germyn, good morning.\"\n\nGermyn was caught off balance. He took his eyes off the sky, half\nturned, glanced at the face of the person who had spoken to him, raised\nhis hand in the assurance-of-identity sign. It was all very quick and\nfluid--almost too quick, for he had had his fingers bent nearly into\nthe sign for female friends and this was a man. Citizen Boyne. Germyn\nknew him well; they had shared the Ice Viewing at Niagara a year before.\n\nGermyn recovered quickly enough, but it had been disconcerting.\n\nHe improvised swiftly: \"There are stars, but are stars still there if\nthere is no Sun?\" It was a hurried effort, he grieved, but no doubt\nBoyne would pick it up and carry it along. Boyne had always been very\ngood, very graceful.\n\nBoyne did no such thing. \"Good morning,\" he said again, faintly. He\nglanced at the stars overhead, as though trying to unravel what Germyn\nwas talking about. He said accusingly, his voice cracking sharply:\n\"There isn't any Sun, Germyn. What do you think of that?\"\n\nGermyn swallowed. \"Citizen, perhaps you--\"\n\n\"No Sun, you hear me!\" the man sobbed. \"It's cold, Germyn. The Pyramids\naren't going to give us another Sun, do you know that? They're going to\nstarve us, freeze us; they're through with us. We're done, all of us!\"\nHe was nearly screaming.\n\nAll up and down Pine Street, people were trying not to look at him and\nsome of them were failing.\n\nBoyne clutched at Germyn helplessly. Revolted, Germyn drew\nback--_bodily contact!_\n\nIt seemed to bring the man to his senses. Reason returned to his eyes.\nHe said: \"I--\" He stopped, stared about him. \"I think I'll have bread\nfor breakfast,\" he said foolishly, and plunged into the stall.\n\nBoyne left behind him a shaken Citizen, caught halfway into the\nwrist-flip of parting, staring after him with jaw slack and eyes wide,\nas though Germyn had no manners, either.\n\nAll this on Sun Re-creation Day!\n\nWhat could it mean? Germyn wondered fretfully, worriedly.\n\nWas Boyne on the point of--\n\nCould Boyne be about to--\n\nGermyn drew back from the thought. There was one thing that might\nexplain Boyne's behavior. But it was not a proper speculation for one\nCitizen to make about another.\n\nAll the same--Germyn dared the thought--all the same, it _did_ seem\nalmost as though Citizen Boyne were on the point of--well, running amok.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the oatmeal stall, Glenn Tropile thumped on the counter. The laggard\noatmeal vendor finally brought the ritual bowl of salt and the pitcher\nof thin milk. Tropile took his paper twist of salt from the top of the\nneatly arranged pile in the bowl. He glanced at the vendor. His fingers\nhesitated. Then, quickly, he ripped the twist of paper into his oatmeal\nand covered it to the permitted level with the milk.\n\nHe ate quickly and efficiently, watching the street outside.\n\nThey were wandering and mooning about, as always--maybe today more than\nmost days, since they hoped it would be the day the Sun blossomed flame\nonce more.\n\nTropile always thought of the wandering, mooning Citizens as _they_.\nThere was a _we_ somewhere for Tropile, no doubt, but Tropile had not\nas yet located it, not even in the bonds of the marriage contract.\n\nHe was in no hurry. At the age of fourteen, Glenn Tropile had\nreluctantly come to realize certain things about himself--that he\ndisliked being bested, that he had to have a certain advantage in\nall his dealings, or an intolerable itch of the mind drove him to\ndiscomfort. The things added up to a terrifying fear, gradually\nbecoming knowledge, that the only we that could properly include him\nwas one that it was not very wise to join.\n\nHe had realized, in fact, that he was a Wolf.\n\nFor some years, Tropile had struggled against it, for Wolf was an\nobscene word; the children he played with were punished severely for\nsaying it, and for almost nothing else.\n\nIt was not _proper_ for one Citizen to advantage himself at the expense\nof another; Wolves did that.\n\nIt was _proper_ for a Citizen to accept what he had, not to strive for\nmore, to find beauty in small things, to accommodate himself, with the\nminimum of strain and awkwardness, to whatever his life happened to be.\n\nWolves were not like that. Wolves never meditated, Wolves never\nAppreciated, Wolves _never_ were Translated--that supreme fulfillment,\ngranted only to those who succeeded in a perfect meditation, that\nsurrender of the world and the flesh by taking leave of both, which\ncould never be achieved by a Wolf.\n\nAccordingly, Glenn Tropile had tried very hard to do all the things\nthat Wolves could not do.\n\nHe had nearly succeeded. His specialty, Water Watching, had been most\nrewarding. He had achieved many partly successful meditations on\nConnectivity.\n\nAnd yet he was still a Wolf, for he still felt that burning, itching\nurge to triumph and to hold an advantage. For that reason, it was\nalmost impossible for him to make friends among the Citizens; and\ngradually he had almost stopped trying.\n\nTropile had arrived in Wheeling nearly a year before, making him one of\nthe early settlers in point of time. And yet there was not a Citizen in\nthe street who was prepared to exchange recognition gestures with him.\n\n_He_ knew _them_, nearly every one. He knew their names and their\nwives' names. He knew what northern states they had moved down from\nwith the spreading of the ice, as the sun grew dim. He knew very nearly\nto the quarter of a gram what stores of sugar and salt and coffee\neach one of them had put away--for their guests, of course, not for\nthemselves; the well-bred Citizen hoarded only for the entertainment of\nothers.\n\nTropile knew these things because there was an advantage in knowing\nthem. But there was no advantage in having anyone know him.\n\nA few did--that banker, Germyn; Tropile had approached him only\na few months before about a prospective loan. But it had been a\nchancy, nervous encounter. The idea was so luminously simple to\nTropile--organize an expedition to the coal mines that once had\nflourished nearby, find the coal, bring it to Wheeling, heat the\nhouses. And yet it had seemed blasphemous to Germyn. Tropile had\ncounted himself lucky merely to have been refused the loan, instead of\nbeing cried out upon as Wolf.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe oatmeal vendor was fussing worriedly around his neat stack of paper\ntwists in the salt bowl.\n\nTropile avoided the man's eyes. Tropile was not interested in the\nlittle wry smile of self-deprecation which the vendor would make to\nhim, given half a chance. Tropile knew well enough what was disturbing\nthe vendor. Let it disturb him. It was Tropile's custom to take extra\ntwists of salt. They were in his pockets now; they would stay there.\nLet the vendor wonder why he was short.\n\nTropile licked the bowl of his spoon and stepped into the street. He\nwas comfortably aware under a double-thick parka that the wind was\nblowing very cold.\n\nA Citizen passed him, walking alone: odd, thought Tropile. He was\nwalking rapidly and there was a look of taut despair on his face. Still\nmore odd. Odd enough to be worth another look, because that sort of\nhaste, that sort of abstraction, suggested something to Tropile. They\nwere in no way normal to the gentle sheep of the class _They_, except\nin one particular circumstance.\n\nGlenn Tropile crossed the street to follow the abstracted Citizen,\nwhose name, he knew, was Boyne. The man blundered into Citizen Germyn\noutside the baker's stall, and Tropile stood back out of easy sight,\nwatching and listening.\n\nBoyne was on the ragged edge of breakdown. What Tropile heard and saw\nconfirmed his diagnosis. The one particular circumstance was close to\nhappening--Citizen Boyne was on the verge of running amok.\n\nTropile looked at the man with amusement and contempt. Amok! The gentle\nsheep _could_ be pushed too far. He had seen Citizens run amok, the\nsigns were obvious.\n\nThere was pretty sure to be an advantage in it for Glenn Tropile. There\nwas an advantage in almost anything, if you looked for it.\n\nHe watched and waited. He picked his spot with care, so that he could\nsee Citizen Boyne inside the baker's stall, making a dismal botch of\nslashing his quarter-kilo of bread from the Morning Loaf.\n\nHe waited for Boyne to come racing out....\n\nBoyne did.\n\nA yell--loud, piercing. It was Citizen Germyn, shrilling: \"Amok, amok!\"\nA scream. An enraged wordless cry from Boyne, and the baker's knife\nglinting in the faint light as Boyne swung it. And then Citizens were\nscattering in every direction--all of the Citizens but one.\n\nOne Citizen was under the knife--his own knife, as it happened; it was\nthe baker himself. Boyne chopped and chopped again. And then Boyne came\nout, roaring, the broad knife whistling about his head. The gentle\nCitizens fled panicked before him. He struck at their retreating forms\nand screamed and struck again. Amok.\n\nIt was the one particular circumstance when they forgot to be\ngracious--one of the two, Tropile corrected himself as he strolled\nacross to the baker's stall. His brow furrowed, because there was\nanother circumstance when they lacked grace, and one which affected him\nnearly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched the maddened creature, Boyne, already far down the road,\nchasing a knot of Citizens around a corner. Tropile sighed and stepped\ninto the baker's stall to see what he might gain from this.\n\nBoyne would wear himself out--the surging rage would leave him as\nquickly as it came; he would be a sheep again and the other sheep would\nclose in and capture him. That was what happened when a Citizen ran\namok. It was a measure of what pressures were on the Citizens that,\nat any moment, there might be one gram of pressure too much and one\nof them would crack. It had happened here in Wheeling twice within\nthe past two months. Glenn Tropile had seen it happen in Pittsburgh,\nAltoona and Bronxville.\n\nThere is a limit to the pressure that can be endured.\n\nTropile walked into the baker's stall and looked down without emotion\nat the slaughtered baker. The corpse was a gory mess, but Tropile had\nseen corpses before.\n\nHe looked around the stall, calculating. As a starter, he bent to pick\nup the quarter-kilo of bread Boyne had dropped, dusted it off and\nslipped it into his pocket. Food was always useful. Given enough food,\nperhaps Boyne would not have run amok.\n\nWas it simple hunger they cracked under? Or the knowledge of the thing\non Mount Everest, or the hovering Eyes, or the sought-after-dreaded\nprospect of Translation, or merely the strain of keeping up their\nlaboriously figured lives?\n\nDid it matter? _They_ cracked and ran amok, and Tropile never would,\nand that was what mattered.\n\nHe leaned across the counter, reaching for what was left of the Morning\nLoaf--\n\nAnd found himself staring into the terrified large eyes of Citizeness\nGermyn.\n\nShe screamed: \"Wolf! Citizens, help me! Wolf!\"\n\nTropile faltered. He hadn't even _seen_ the damned woman, but there she\nwas, rising up from behind the counter, screaming her head off: \"Wolf!\nWolf!\"\n\nHe said sharply: \"Citizeness, I beg you--\" But that was no good. The\nevidence was on him and her screams would fetch others.\n\nTropile panicked. He started toward her to silence her, but that was no\ngood, either. He whirled. She was screaming, screaming, and there were\npeople to hear. Tropile darted into the street, but they were popping\nout of every doorway now, appearing from each rat's hole in which they\nhad hid to escape Boyne.\n\n\"Please!\" he cried, sobbing. \"Wait a minute!\"\n\nBut they weren't waiting. They had heard the woman and maybe some of\nthem had seen him with the bread. They were all around him--no, they\nwere all over him; they were clutching at him, tearing at his soft,\nwarm furs.\n\nThey pulled at his pockets and the stolen twists of salt spilled\naccusingly out. They yanked at his sleeves and even the stout,\nunweakened seams ripped open. He was fairly captured.\n\n\"Wolf!\" they were shouting. \"Wolf!\" It drowned out the distant noise\nfrom where Boyne had finally been run to earth, a block and more away.\nIt drowned out everything.\n\nIt was the other circumstance when _they_ forgot to be gracious: when\nthey had trapped a Son of the Wolf.\n\n\nIII\n\nEngineering had long ago come to an end.\n\nEngineering is possible under one condition of the equation: Total\navailable Calories divided by Population equals Artistic-Technological\nStyle. When the ratio Calories-to-Population is large--say, five\nthousand or more, five thousand daily calories for every living\nperson--then the Artistic-Technological Style is _big_. People carve\nMount Rushmore; they build great foundries; they manufacture enormous\nautomobiles to carry one housewife half a mile for the purchase of one\nlipstick.\n\nLife is coarse and rich where C:P is large. At the other extreme, where\nC:P is too small, life does not exist at all. It has starved out.\n\nExperimentally, add little increments to C:P and it will be some time\nbefore the right-hand side of the equation becomes significant. But\nat last, in the 1,000 to 1,500 calorie range, Artistic-Technological\nStyle firmly appears in self-perpetuating form. C:P in that range\nproduces the small arts, the appreciations, the peaceful arrangements\nof necessities into subtle relationships of traditionally agreed-upon\nvirtue.\n\nThink of Japan, locked into its Shogunate prison, with a hungry\npopulation scrabbling food out of mountainsides and beauty out of\narrangements of lichens. The small, inexpensive sub-sub-arts are\ncharacteristic of the 1,000 to 1,500 calorie range.\n\nAnd this was the range of Earth, the world of ten billion men, when the\nplanet was stolen by its new binary.\n\nSome few persons inexpensively studied the study of science with\npencil and renewable paper, but the last research accelerator had long\nsince been shut down. The juice from its hydro-power dam was needed to\nsupply meager light to a million homes and to cook the pablum for two\nmillion brand-new babies.\n\nIn those days, one dedicated Byzantine wrote the definitive\nencyclopedia of engineering (though he was no engineer). Its four\nhundred and twenty tiny volumes examined exhaustively the engineering\nfeats of ancient Greece and Egypt, the Wall of Shih-Hwang Ti,\nthe Gothic builders, Brunel who changed the face of England, the\nRoeblings of Brooklyn, Groves of the Pentagon, Duggan of the Shelter\nSystem (before C:P dropped to the point where war became vanishingly\nimplausible), Levern of Operation Up. But the encyclopedist could not\nuse a slide rule without thinking, faltering, jotting down his decimals.\n\nAnd then ... the magnitudes grew less.\n\nUnder the tectonic and climatic battering of the great abduction of\nEarth from its primary, under the sine-wave advances to and retreats\nfrom the equator of the ice sheath, as the small successor Suns waxed,\nwaned, died and were replaced, the ratio C:P remained stable. C had\ndiminished enormously; so had P. As the calories to support life grew\nscarce, so the consuming mouths of mankind grew less in number.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe forty-fifth small Sun shone on no engineers.\n\nNot even on the binary, perhaps. The Pyramids, the things on the\nbinary, the thing on Mount Everest--they were not engineers. They\nemployed a crude metaphysic based on dissection and shoving.\n\nThey had no elegant field theories. All they knew was that everything\ncame apart, and that if you pushed a thing, it would move.\n\nIf your biggest push would not move a thing, you took it apart and\npushed the parts, and then it would move. Sometimes, for nuclear\neffects, they had to take things apart into 3 \u00d7 10^9 pieces and shove\neach piece very carefully.\n\nBy taking apart and shoving, then, they landed their one spaceship\non the burned-out sunlet. Four human beings were on that ship. They\nmeditated briefly on Connectivity and died screaming.\n\nA point of new flame appeared on the sunlet's surface and the spaceship\nscrambled for the binary. The point of flame went from cherry through\norange into the blue-white and began to spread.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the moment of the Re-creation of the Sun, there was rejoicing on the\nEarth.\n\nNot quite everywhere, though. In Wheeling's House of the Five\nRegulations, Glenn Tropile waited unquietly for death. Citizen Boyne,\nwho had run amok and slaughtered the baker, shared Tropile's room and\nhis doom, but not his rage. Boyne, with demure pleasure, was composing\nhis death poem.\n\n\"Talk to me!\" snapped Tropile. \"Why are we here? What did you do and\nwhy did you do it? What have I done? Why don't I pick up a bench and\nkill you with it? You would've killed me two hours ago if I'd caught\nyour eye!\"\n\nThere was no satisfaction in Citizen Boyne; the passions were burned\nout of him. He politely tendered Tropile a famous aphorism: \"Citizen,\nthe art of living is the substitution of unimportant, answerable\nquestions for important, unanswerable ones. Come, let us appreciate the\nnew-born Sun.\"\n\nHe turned to the window, where the spark of blue-white flame in what\nhad once been the crater of Tycho was beginning to spread across the\ncharred moon.\n\nTropile was child enough of his culture to turn with him, almost\ninvoluntarily. He was silent. That blue-white infinitesimal up there\ngrowing slowly--the oneness, the calm rapture of Being in a universe\nthat you shaded into without harsh discontinua, the being one with the\ngreat blue-white gem-flower blossoming now in the heavens that were no\ndifferent stuff than you yourself--\n\nHe closed his eyes, calm, and meditated on Connectivity.\n\nHe was being Good.\n\nBy the time the fusion reaction had covered the whole small disk of the\nsunlet, a quarter-hour at the most, his meditation began to wear off.\n\nTropile shrugged out of his torn parka, not bothering to rip it\nfurther. It was already growing warm in the room. Citizen Boyne, of\ncourse, was carefully opening every seam with graceful rending motions,\nmiming great and smooth effort of the biceps and trapezius.\n\nBut the meditation was over, and as Tropile watched his cellmate, he\nscreamed a silent _Why?_ Since his adolescence, that wailing syllable\nhad seldom been far from his mind. It could be silenced by appreciation\nand meditation.\n\nTropile's specialty was Water Watching and he was so good at it that\nseveral beginners had asked him for instruction in the subtle art, in\nspite of his notorious oddities of life and manner. He _enjoyed_ Water\nWatching. He almost pitied anybody so single-mindedly devoted to, say,\nClouds and Odors--great game though it was--that he had never even\ntried Water Watching. And after a session of Watching, when one was\nlucky enough to observe the Nine Boiling Stages in classic perfection,\none might slip into meditation and be harmonious, feel Good.\n\nBut what did one do when the meditations failed, as they had failed\nhim? What did one do when they came farther and farther apart, became\nless and less intense, could be inspired, finally, only by a huge event\nlike the renewal of the Sun?\n\nOne went amok, he had always thought.\n\nBut he had not. Boyne had. He had been declared a Son of the Wolf, on\nno evidence that he could understand. Yet he had not run amok.\n\nStill, the penalties were the same, he thought, uncomfortably aware\nof an unfamiliar itch--not the inward intolerable itch of needing the\nadvantage, but a localized sensation at the base of his spine. The\npenalties for all gross crimes--Wolfhood or running amok--were the\nsame, and simply this:\n\nThey would perform the Lumbar Puncture. He would make the Donation of\nSpinal Fluid.\n\nHe would be dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Keeper of the House of Five Regulations, an old man, Citizen\nHarmane, looked in on his charges--approvingly at Boyne, with a\nbeclouded expression at Glenn Tropile.\n\nIt was thought that even Wolves were entitled to the common human\ndecencies in the brief interval between exposure and the Donation\nof Fluid. The Keeper would not have dreamed of scowling at the\ndetected Wolf or of interfering with whatever wretched imitation of\nmeditation-before-dying the creature might practice. But he could not,\nall the same, bring himself to offer even an assurance-of-identity\ngesture.\n\nTropile had no such qualms.\n\nHe scowled at Keeper Harmane with such ferocity that the old man almost\nhurried away. He turned an almost equally ugly scowl upon Citizen\nBoyne. How dared that knife-murderer be so calm, so relaxed!\n\nTropile said brutally: \"They'll kill us! You know that? They'll stick\na needle in our spines and drain us dry. It _hurts_. Do you understand\nme? They're going to drain us, and then they're going to drink our\nspinal fluid, and it's going to _hurt_.\"\n\nHe was gently corrected. \"We shall make the Donation,\" Citizen Boyne\nsaid calmly. \"Is not the difference intelligible to a Son of the Wolf?\"\n\nTrue culture demanded that that remark be accepted as a friendly joke,\nprobably based on a truth--how else could an unpalatable truth be put\nin words? Otherwise the unthinkable might happen. They might quarrel.\nThey might even come to blows!\n\nThe appropriate mild smile formed on Tropile's lips, but harshly he\nwiped it off. They were going to _kill_ him. He would _not_ smile for\nthem! And the effort was enormous.\n\n\"I'm _not_ a Son of the Wolf!\" he howled, desperate, knowing he was\nprotesting to the man of all men in Wheeling who didn't care, and\nwho could do least about it if he did. \"What's this crazy talk about\nWolves? I don't know what a Son of the Wolf is and I don't think you\nor anybody does. All I know is that I was acting _sensibly_. And\neverybody began howling! You're supposed to know a Son of the Wolf by\nhis unculture, his ignorance, his violence. But you chopped down three\npeople and I only picked up a piece of bread! And _I'm_ supposed to be\nthe dangerous one!\"\n\n\"Wolves never know they're Wolves,\" sighed Citizen Boyne. \"Fish\nprobably think they're birds and you evidently think you're a Citizen.\nWould a Citizen speak as you are speaking?\"\n\n\"But they're going to kill us!\"\n\n\"Then why aren't you composing your death poem?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlenn Tropile took a deep breath. Something was biting him. It was bad\nenough that he was about to die, bad enough that he had done nothing\nworth dying for. But what was gnawing at him now had nothing to do with\ndying.\n\nThe percentages were going the wrong way. This pale Citizen was getting\nan edge on him.\n\nAn engorged gland in Tropile's adrenals--it was only a pinhead\nin Citizen Boyne's--gushed raw hormones into his bloodstream. He\ncould die, yes--that was a skill everyone had to acquire, sooner or\nlater. But while he was alive, he could not stand to be bested in an\nencounter, an argument, a relationship--not and stay alive. Wolf? Call\nhim Wolf. Call him Operator, or Percentage Player; call him Sharp\nArticle; call him Gamesman.\n\nIf there was an advantage to be derived, he would derive it. It was the\nway he was put together.\n\nHe said, for time: \"You're right. Stupid of me. I must have lost my\nhead!\"\n\nHe thought. Some men think by poking problems apart; some think by\nlaying facts side by side to compare. Tropile's thinking was neither\nof these, but a species of judo. He conceded to his opponent such\nthings as Strength, Armor, Resource. He didn't need these things for\nhimself; to every contest, the opponent brought enough of them to\nsupply two. It was Tropile's habit (and Wolfish, he had to admit) to\nuse the opponent's strength against him, to break the opponent against\nhis own steel walls.\n\nHe thought.\n\nThe first thing was to make up his mind: He was Wolf. Then let him _be_\nWolf. He wouldn't stay around for the spinal tap; he would go from\nthere. But how?\n\nThe second thing was to plan. There were obstacles. Citizen Boyne was\none. The Keeper of the House of the Five Regulations was another.\n\nWhere was the pole which would permit him to vault over these hurdles?\nThere was always his wife, Gala. He owned her; she would do what he\nwished--provided he made her _want_ to do it.\n\nYes, Gala. He walked to the door and shouted to Citizen Harmane:\n\"Keeper! I must see my wife! Have her brought to me!\"\n\nIt was impossible for the Keeper to refuse. He called gently, \"I will\ninvite the Citizeness,\" and toddled away.\n\nThe third thing was time.\n\nTropile turned to Citizen Boyne. \"Citizen,\" he said persuasively,\n\"since your death poem is ready and mine is not, will you be gracious\nenough to go first when they--when they come?\"\n\nCitizen Boyne looked temperately at his cellmate and made the Quirked\nSmile.\n\n\"You see?\" he said. \"Wolf.\"\n\nAnd that was true. But what was also true was that Boyne couldn't and\ndidn't refuse.\n\n\nIV\n\nHalf a world away, the midnight-blue Pyramid sat on its planed-off peak\nas it had sat since the days when Earth had a real sun of its own.\n\nIt was of no importance to the Pyramid that Glenn Tropile was about to\nreceive a slim catheter into his spine, to drain his saps and his life.\nIt didn't matter to the Pyramid that the pretext for the execution\nwas an act which human history had long stopped considering a capital\ncrime. Ritual sacrifice in any guise made no difference to the Pyramid.\n\nThe Pyramid saw them come and the Pyramid saw them go--if the Pyramid\ncould be said to \"see.\" One human being more or less, what matter? Who\nbothers to take a census of the cells in a hangnail?\n\nAnd yet the Pyramid did have a kind of interest in Glenn Tropile. Or,\nat least, in the human race of which he was a part.\n\nNobody knew much about the Pyramids, but everybody knew _that_ much.\nThey wanted something--else why would they have bothered to steal the\nEarth?\n\nThe date of the theft was 2027. A great year--the year of the first\nlandings on the Runaway Planet that had come blundering into the Solar\nSystem. Maybe those landings were a mistake--although they were a very\ngreat triumph, too; but maybe if it hadn't been for the landings, the\nRunaway Planet might have run right through the ecliptic and away.\n\nHowever, the triumphal mistake was made and that was the first time a\nhuman eye saw a Pyramid.\n\nShortly after--though not before a radio message was sent--that human\neye winked out forever; but by then the damage was done. What passed\nin a Pyramid for \"attention\" had been attracted. The next thing that\nhappened set the wireless channels between Palomar and Pernambuco,\nbetween Greenwich and the Cape of Good Hope, buzzing and worrying, as\nastronomers all over the Earth reported and confirmed and reconfirmed\nthe astonishing fact that our planet was on the move. Rejoice in\nMessias had come to take us away.\n\nA world of ten billion people, some of them brilliant, many of them\nbrave, built and flung the giant rockets of Operation Up at the\ninvader: Nothing.\n\nThe first, and only, Interplanetary Expeditionary Force was boosted up\nto no-gravity and dropped onto the new planet to strike back: Nothing.\n\nEarth moved spirally outward.\n\nIf a battle could not be won, then perhaps a migration. New ships were\nbuilt in haste. But they lay there rusting as the sun grew small and\nthe ice grew thick, because where was there to go? Not Mars. Not the\nMoon, which was trailing alone. Not choking Venus or crushing Jupiter.\n\nThe migration was defeated as surely as the war, there being no place\nto migrate to.\n\nOne Pyramid came to Earth, only one. It shaved the crest off the\nhighest mountain there was and squatted on it. An observer? A warden?\nWhatever it was, it stayed.\n\nThe sun grew too distant to be of use, and out of the old Moon, the\nPyramid aliens built a new small sun in the sky--a five-year sun that\nburned out and was replaced, again and again and endlessly again.\n\nIt had been a fierce struggle against unbeatable odds on the part of\nthe ten billion; and when the uselessness of struggle was demonstrated\nat last, many of the ten billion froze to death, and many of them\nstarved, and nearly all of the rest had something frozen or starved\nout of them; and what was left, two centuries and more later, was more\nor less like Citizen Boyne, except for a few--a very few--like Glenn\nTropile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGala Tropile stared miserably at her husband. \"I want to get out of\nhere,\" he was saying urgently. \"They mean to kill me. Gala, you know\nyou can't make yourself suffer by letting them kill me!\"\n\nShe wailed: \"I _can't_!\"\n\nTropile looked over his shoulder. Citizen Boyne was fingering\nthe textured contrasts of a golden watch-case which had been his\nfather's--and soon would be his son's. Boyne's eyes were closed and he\nwasn't listening.\n\nTropile leaned forward and deliberately put his hand on his wife's arm.\nShe started and flushed, of course.\n\n\"You _can_,\" he said, \"and what's more, you will. You can help me get\nout of here. I insist on it, Gala, because I must save you that pain.\"\n\nHe took his hand off her arm, content.\n\nHe said harshly: \"Darling, don't you think I know how much we've\nalways meant to each other?\"\n\nShe looked at him wretchedly. Fretfully she tore at the billowing filmy\nsleeve of her summer blouse. The seams hadn't been loosened; there\nhad not been time. She had just been getting into the appropriate Sun\nRe-creation Day costume, to be worn under the parka, when the messenger\nhad come with the news about her husband.\n\nShe avoided his eyes. \"If you're really Wolf....\"\n\nTropile's sub-adrenals pulsed and filled him with confident strength.\n\"_You_ know what I am--you better than anyone else.\" It was a sly\nreminder of their curious furtive behavior together; like the hand on\nher arm, it had its effect. \"After all, why do we quarrel the way we\ndid last night?\"\n\nHe hurried on; the job of the rowel was to spur her to action, not to\ninflame a wound. \"Because we're _important_ to each other. I know that\nyou would count on me to help if you were in trouble. And I know that\nyou'd be hurt--_deeply_, Gala!--if I didn't count on you.\"\n\nShe sniffled and scuffed the bright strap over her open-toed sandal.\n\nThen she met his eyes.\n\nIt was the after-effect of the argument, of course. Glenn Tropile knew\njust how heavily he could rely on the after-spiral of a quarrel. She\nwas submitting.\n\nShe glanced furtively at Citizen Boyne and lowered her voice.\n\n\"What do I have to do?\" she whispered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn five minutes, she was gone, but that was more than enough time.\nTropile had at least thirty minutes left. They would take Boyne first;\nhe had seen to that. And once Boyne was gone--\n\nTropile wrenched a leg off his three-legged stool and sat precariously\nbalanced on the other two. He tossed the loose leg clattering into a\ncorner.\n\nThe Keeper of the House of Five Regulations ambled slack-bodied by and\nglanced into the room. \"Wolf, what happened to your stool?\"\n\nTropile made a left-handed sign of no-importance. \"It doesn't matter.\nExcept it _is_ hard to meditate, sitting on this thing, with every\nmuscle tensing and fighting against every other to keep my balance....\"\n\nThe Keeper made an overruling sign of please-let-me-help. \"It's your\nlast half-hour, Wolf,\" he reminded Tropile. \"I'll fix the stool for\nyou.\"\n\nHe entered and slammed and banged it together, and left with an\nexpression of mild concern. Even a Son of the Wolf was entitled to the\nfullest appreciation of that unique opportunity for meditation, the\nlast half-hour before a Donation.\n\nIn five minutes, the Keeper was back, looking solemn and yet glad, like\na bearer of serious but welcome tidings.\n\n\"It is the time for the first Donation,\" he announced. \"Which of you--\"\n\n\"Him,\" said Tropile quickly, pointing.\n\nBoyne opened his eyes calmly and nodded. He got to his feet, made a\nformal leavetaking bow to Tropile, and followed the Keeper toward his\nDonation and his death. As they were going out, Tropile coughed a\nwould-you-please-grant-me-a-favor cough.\n\nThe Keeper paused. \"What is it, Wolf?\"\n\nTropile showed him the empty water pitcher--empty, all right; he had\nemptied it out the window.\n\n\"My apologies,\" the Keeper said, flustered, and hurried Boyne along. He\ncame back almost at once to fill the pitcher, even though he should be\nthere to watch Boyne's ceremonial Donation.\n\nTropile stood looking at the Keeper, his sub-adrenals beginning to\npound like the rolling boil of Well-aged Water. The Keeper was at a\ndisadvantage. He had been neglectful of his charge--a broken stool, no\nwater in the pitcher. And a Citizen, brought up in a Citizen's maze of\nconsideration and tact, could not help but be humiliated, seeking to\nmake amends.\n\nTropile pressed his advantage home. \"Wait,\" he said to the Keeper. \"I'd\nlike to talk to you.\"\n\nThe Keeper hesitated, torn. \"The Donation--\"\n\n\"Damn the Donation,\" Tropile said calmly. \"After all, what is it but\nsticking a pipe into a man's backbone and sucking out the juice that\nkeeps him alive? It's killing, that's all.\"\n\nThe Keeper turned literally white. Tropile was speaking blasphemy and\nhe wasn't stopping.\n\n\"I want to tell you about my wife,\" Tropile went on, assuming a\nconfidential air. \"Now there's a real _woman_. Not one of these\nfrozen-up Citizenesses, you know? Why, she and I used to--\" He\nhesitated. \"You're a man of the world, aren't you?\" he demanded. \"I\nmean you've seen life.\"\n\n\"I--suppose so,\" the Keeper said faintly.\n\n\"Then you won't be shocked,\" Tropile lied. \"Well, let me tell you,\nthere's a lot to women that these stuffed-shirt Citizens don't know\nabout. Boy! Ever see a woman's knee?\" He sniggered. \"Ever kiss a woman\nwith--\" he winked--\"with the _light on_? Ever sit in a big armchair,\nsay, with a woman in your _lap_--all soft and heavy, and kind of warm,\nand slumped up against your chest, you know, and--\"\n\nHe stopped and swallowed. He was almost making himself retch, it was so\nhard to say these things. But he forced himself to go on: \"Well, that's\nwhat she and I used to do. Plenty. All the time. That's what I call a\nreal _woman_.\"\n\nHe stopped, warned by the Keeper's sudden change of expression, glazed\neyes, strangling breath. He had gone too far. He had only wanted to\nparalyze the man, revolt him, put him out of commission, but he was\noverdoing it. He jumped forward and caught the Keeper as he fell,\nfainting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTropile callously emptied the water pitcher over the man. The Keeper\nsneezed and sat up groggily. He focused his eyes on Tropile and\nagonizedly blushed.\n\nTropile said harshly: \"I wish to see the new sun from the street.\"\n\nThe request was incredible. Even after the unbelievable obscenities\nhe had heard, the Keeper was not prepared for this; he was staggered.\nTropile was in detention regarding the Fifth Regulation. That was\nall there was to it. Such persons were not to be released from their\nquarters. The Keeper knew it, the world knew it, Tropile knew it.\n\nIt was an obscenity even greater than the lurid tales of perverted\nlust, for Tropile had asked something which was impossible! No one\n_ever_ asked anything that was impossible to grant, for no one could\never refuse anything. That was utterly graceless, unthinkable.\n\nOne could only attempt to compromise. The Keeper stammeringly said:\n\"May I--may I let you see the new sun from the corridor?\" And even that\nwas wretchedly wrong, but he had to offer something. One always offered\nsomething. The Keeper had never since babyhood given a flat no to\nanybody about anything. No Citizen had. A flat no led to anger, strong\nwords--perhaps even hurt feelings. The only flat no conceivable was the\nenormous terminal no of an amok. Short of that--\n\nOne offered. One split the difference. One was invariably filled with\ntepid pleasure when, invariably, the offer was accepted, the difference\nwas split, both parties were satisfied.\n\n\"That will do for a start,\" Tropile snarled. \"Open, man, open! Don't\nmake me wait.\"\n\nThe Keeper reeled and unlatched the door to the corridor.\n\n\"Now the street!\"\n\n\"I can't!\" burst in an anguished cry from the Keeper. He buried his\nface in his hands and began to sob, hopelessly incapacitated.\n\n\"The street!\" Tropile said remorselessly. He himself felt wrenchingly\nill; he was going against custom that had ruled his own life as surely\nas the Keeper's.\n\nBut he was Wolf. \"I _will_ be Wolf,\" he growled, and advanced upon the\nKeeper. \"My wife,\" he said, \"I didn't finish telling you. Sometimes she\nused to put her arm around me and just snuggle up and--I remember one\ntime she kissed my ear. Broad daylight. It felt funny and warm--I can't\ndescribe it.\"\n\nWhimpering, the Keeper flung the keys at Tropile and tottered brokenly\naway.\n\nHe was out of the action. Tropile himself was nearly as badly off; the\ndifference was that he continued to function. The words coming from him\nhad seared like acid in his throat.\n\n\"They call me Wolf,\" he said aloud, reeling against the wall. \"I will\nbe one.\"\n\nHe unlocked the outer door and his wife was waiting, holding in her\narms the things he had asked her to bring.\n\nTropile said strangely to her: \"I am steel and fire. I am Wolf, full of\nthe old moxie.\"\n\nShe wailed: \"Glenn, are you sure I'm doing the right thing?\"\n\nHe laughed unsteadily and led her by the arm through the deserted\nstreets.\n\n\nV\n\nCitizen Germyn, as was his right by position and status as a\nconnoisseur, helped prepare Citizen Boyne for his Donation. There\nwas nothing much to it--which made it an elaborate and lengthy task,\naccording to the ethic of the Citizens; it had to be protracted, each\nstep being surrounded by fullest dress of ritual.\n\nIt was done in the broad daylight of the new Sun, and as many of the\nthree hundred citizens of Wheeling as could manage it were in the\ncourtyard of the old Federal Building to watch.\n\nThe nature of the ceremony was this: A man who revealed himself Wolf,\nor who finally crumbled under the demands of life and ran amok, could\nnot be allowed to live. He was hauled before an audience of his equals\nand permitted--with the help of regretful force, if that should be\nnecessary, but preferably not--to make the Donation of Spinal Fluid.\n\nExecution was murder and murder was not permitted under the gentle code\nof Citizens; this was not execution. The draining of a man's spinal\nfluid did not kill him. It only insured that, after a time and with\nmuch suffering, his internal chemistry would so arrange itself that it\nwould continue to function, only not in a way that would sustain life.\n\nOnce the Donation was made, the problem was completely altered, of\ncourse. Suffering was bad in itself. To save the Donor from the\nsuffering that lay ahead, it was the custom to have the oldest and\ngentlest Citizen on hand stand by with a sharp-edged knife. When the\nDonation was complete, the Donor's head was removed--purely to avert\nsuffering. That was not execution, either, but only the hastening of an\ninevitable end.\n\nThe dozen or so Citizens whose rank permitted them to assist then\ndissolved the spinal fluids in water and ceremoniously sipped them, at\nwhich time it was proper to offer a small poem in commentary. All in\nall, it was a perfectly splendid opportunity for the purest form of\nmeditation for everyone concerned.\n\nCitizen Germyn, whose role was Catheter Bearer, took his place behind\nthe Introducer Bearer, the Annunciators and the Questioner of Purpose.\nAs he passed Citizen Boyne, Germyn assisted him to assume the proper\ncrouched-over position. Boyne looked up gratefully and Germyn found\nthe occasion correct for a commendatory half-smile.\n\nThe Questioner of Purpose said solemnly to Boyne: \"It is your privilege\nto make a Donation here today. Do you wish to do so?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Boyne raptly. The anxiety had passed; clearly he was\nconfident of making a good Donation. Germyn approved with all his heart.\n\nThe Annunciators, in alternate stanzas, announced the right pause for\nmeditation to the meager crowd, and all fell silent. Citizen Germyn\nbegan the process of blanking out his mind, to ready himself for the\ngreat opportunity to Appreciate that lay ahead. A sound distracted\nhim; he glanced up irritably. It seemed to come from the House of the\nFive Regulations, a man's voice, carrying. But no one else appeared to\nnotice it. All of the watchers, all of those on the stone steps, were\nin somber meditation.\n\nGermyn tried to return his thoughts to where they belonged.\n\nBut something was troubling him. He had caught a glimpse of the Donor\nand there had been something--something--\n\nHe angrily permitted himself to look up once more to see just what it\nhad been about Citizen Boyne that had attracted his attention.\n\nYes, there _was_ something. Over the form of Citizen Boyne, silent,\nbarely visible, a flicker of life and motion. Nothing tangible. It was\nas if the air itself were in motion.\n\nIt was, Germyn thought with a bursting heart--it was an Eye!\n\nThe veritable miracle of Translation and it was about to take place\nhere and now, upon the person of Citizen Boyne! And no one knew it but\nGermyn himself!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn this last surmise, Citizen Germyn was wrong. Or was he? True, no\nother human eyes saw the flawed-glass thing that twisted the air over\nBoyne's prostrate body, but there was, in a sense, another witness ...\nsome thousands of miles away.\n\nThe Pyramid on Mount Everest \"stirred.\"\n\nIt did not move, but something about it moved, or changed, or radiated.\nThe Pyramid surveyed its--cabbage patch? Wristwatch mine? As much\nsense, it may be, to say wristwatch patch or cabbage mine. At any rate,\nit surveyed what to it was a place where intricate mechanisms grew,\nripened and were dug up at the moment of usefulness, whereupon they\nwere quick-frozen and wired into circuits.\n\nThrough signals perceptible to it, the Pyramids had become \"aware\" that\none of its mechanisms was now ready to be plucked--harvested.\n\nThe Pyramid's blood was dielectric fluid. Its limbs were electrostatic\ncharges. Its philosophy was: Unscrew It and Push. Its motive was\nsurvival.\n\nSurvival today was not what survival once had been, for a Pyramid.\n\nOnce survival had merely been gliding along on a cushion of repellent\ncharges, streaming electrons behind for the push, sending h-f pulses\nout often enough to get a picture of their bounced return to integrate\ndeep inside.\n\nIf the picture showed something metabolizable, one metabolized it. One\nbroke it down into molecules by lashing it with the surplus protons\nleft over from the dispersed electrons; one adsorbed the molecules.\nSometimes the metabolizable object was an Immobile and sometimes a\nMobile--a vague, theoretical, frivolous classification to a philosophy\nwhose basis was that _everything_ unscrewed. If it was a Mobile, one\nsometimes had to move after it.\n\nThat was the difference.\n\nThe essential was survival, not making idle distinctions. And one small\npart of survival today was the Everest Pyramid's job.\n\nIt sat and waited. It sent out its h-f pulses bouncing and scattering,\nand it bounced and scattered them additionally on their return.\nDeep inside, the more-than-anamorphically distorted picture was\nreintegrated. Deeper inside, it was interpreted and evaluated for its\npart in survival.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a need for certain mechanisms which grew on this planet. At\nirregular times, the Pyramid evaluated the picture to the effect that\na mechanism--a wristwatch, so to speak--was ripe for plucking; and\nby electrostatic charges, it did so. The electrostatic charges, in\nforming, produced what humans called an Eye. But the Pyramid had no use\nfor names.\n\nIt merely plucked, when a mechanism was ripe. It had found that a\nmechanism was ripe now.\n\nA world away, before the steps of Wheeling's Federal Building,\nelectrostatic charges gathered above a component whose name was Citizen\nBoyne. There was a small sound like the clapping of two hands which\nmade the three hundred citizens of Wheeling jerk upright out of their\nmeditations.\n\nThe sound was air filling the gap that had once been occupied by\nCitizen Boyne, who had instantly vanished--who had, in a word, been\nripe and therefore been plucked.\n\n\nVI\n\nGlenn Tropile and his sobbing wife passed the night in the stubble of a\ncornfield. Neither of them slept much.\n\nTropile, numbed by contact with the iron chill of the field--it would\nbe months before the new Sun warmed the Earth enough for it to begin\nradiating in turn--tossed restlessly, dreaming. He was Wolf. Let it be\nso, he told himself again and again. I _will_ be Wolf. I will strike\nback at the Citizens. I will--\n\nAlways the thought trailed off. He would exactly _What_? What could he\ndo?\n\nMigration was an answer--go to another city. With Gala, he guessed.\nStart a new life, where he was not known as Wolf.\n\nAnd then what? Try to live a sheep's life, as he had tried all his\nyears? And there was the question of whether, in fact, he could manage\nto find a city where he was not known. The human race was migratory,\nin these years of subjection to the never quite understood rule of the\nPyramids.\n\nIt was a matter of insulation. When the new Sun was young, it was hot,\nand there was plenty of warmth; it was possible to spread north and\nsouth, away from final line of permafrost which, in North America,\ncame just above the old Mason-Dixon line. When the Sun was dying, the\ncold spread down. The race followed the seasons. Soon all of Wheeling\nwould be spreading north again, and how was he to be sure that none of\nWheeling's Citizens might not turn up wherever he might go?\n\nHe could be sure--that was the answer to that.\n\nAll right, scratch migration. What remained? He could--with Gala, he\nguessed--live a solitary life on the fringes of cultivated land. They\nboth had some skill at rummaging the old storehouses of the ancients,\nand there was still food and other commodities to be found.\n\nBut even a Wolf is gregarious by nature and there were bleak hours in\nthat night when Tropile found himself close to sobbing with his wife.\n\nAt the first break of dawn, he was up. Gala had fallen into a light and\nrestless sleep; he called her awake.\n\n\"We have to move,\" he said harshly. \"Maybe they'll get up enough guts\nto follow us. I don't want them to find us.\"\n\nSilently she got up. They rolled and tied the blankets she had bought;\nthey ate quickly from the food she had brought; they made packs and put\nthem on their shoulders and started to walk. One thing in their favor:\nthey were moving fast, faster than any Citizen was likely to follow.\nAll the same, Tropile kept looking nervously behind him.\n\nThey hurried north and east, and that was a mistake, because by noon\nthey found themselves blocked by water. Once it had been a river; the\nmelting of the polar ice caps that had submerged the coasts of the old\ncontinents had drowned it out and now it was salt water. But whatever\nit was, it was impassable. They would have to skirt it westward until\nthey found a bridge or a boat.\n\n\"We can stop and eat,\" Tropile said grudgingly, trying not to despair.\n\nThey slumped to the ground. It was warmer now. Tropile found himself\ngetting drowsier, drowsier--\n\nHe jerked erect and stared around belligerently. Beside him, his wife\nwas lying motionless, though her eyes were open, gazing at the sky.\nTropile sighed and stretched out. A moment's rest, he promised himself,\nand then a quick bite to eat, and then onward....\n\nHe was sound asleep when they spotted him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a flutter of iron bird's wings from overhead. Tropile\njumped up out of his sleep, awakening to panic. It was outside the\npossibility of belief, but there it was:\n\nIn the sky over him, etched black against a cloud, a helicopter. And\nmen staring out of it, staring down at him.\n\nA helicopter!\n\nBut there were no helicopters, or none that flew--if there had been\nfuel to fly them with--if any man had had the skill to make them fly.\nIt was impossible! And yet there it was, and the men were looking at\nhim, and the impossible great whirling thing was coming down, nearer.\n\nHe began to run in the downward wash of air from the vanes. But it was\nno use. There were three men and they were fresh and he wasn't. He\nstopped, dropping into the fighter's crouch that is pre-set into the\nhuman body, ready to do battle.\n\nThe men didn't want to fight. They laughed and one of them said\namiably: \"_Long_ past your bedtime, boy. Get in. We'll take you home.\"\n\nTropile stood poised, hands half-clenched. \"Take--\"\n\n\"Take you home. Yeah. Where you belong, Tropile. Not back to Wheeling,\nif that's what is worrying you.\"\n\n\"Where I--\"\n\n\"Where you belong.\"\n\nThen Tropile understood.\n\nHe got into the helicopter wonderingly. Home. So there _was_ a home\nfor such as he. He wasn't alone. He needn't keep his solitary self\napart. He could be with his own kind.\n\nHe remembered Gala Tropile and paused. One of the men said with quick\nunderstanding: \"Your wife? I think we saw her about half a mile from\nhere. Heading back to Wheeling as fast as she could go.\"\n\nTropile nodded. That was better, after all. Gala was no Wolf, though he\nhad tried his best to make her one.\n\nOne of the men closed the door; another did something with levers and\nwheels; the vanes whooshed around overhead; the helicopter bounced on\nits stiff-sprung landing legs and then rocked up and away.\n\nFor the first time in his life, Glenn Tropile looked _down_ on the land.\n\nThey didn't fly high--but Glenn Tropile had never flown at all, and\nthe two or three hundred feet of air beneath made him faint and queasy.\nThey danced through the passes in the West Virginia hills, crossed icy\nstreams and rivers, swung past old empty towns which no longer even had\nnames of their own. They saw no one.\n\nIt was something over four hundred miles to where they were going, one\nof the men told him. They made it easily before dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Tropile walked through the town in the evening light, electricity\nflared white and violet in the buildings around him. Imagine!\nElectricity was calories, and calories were to be hoarded.\n\nThere were other walkers in the street. Their gait was not the\neconomical shuffle with pendant arms. They burned energy visibly. They\nswung. They _strode_. It had been chiseled on his brain in earliest\nchildhood that such walking was wrong, reprehensible, debilitating. It\nwasted calories. These people did not look debilitated and they didn't\nseem to mind wasting calories.\n\nIt was an ordinary sort of town, apparently named Princeton. It did not\nhave the transient look to it of, say, Wheeling, or Altoona, or Gary,\nin Tropile's experience. It looked like--well, it looked permanent.\n\nTropile had heard of a town called Princeton, but it happened that\nhe had never passed through it southwarding or northbound. There was\nno reason why he or anybody should or should not have. Still, there\nwas a possibility, once he thought of it, that things were somehow so\narranged that they should not; maybe it was all on purpose. Like every\ntown, it was underpopulated, but not so much so as most. Perhaps one\nliving space in five was used. A high ratio.\n\nThe man beside him was named Haendl, one of the men from the\nhelicopter. They hadn't talked much on the flight and they didn't talk\nmuch now. \"Eat first,\" Haendl said, and took Tropile to a bright and\nbusy sort of food stall. Only it wasn't a stall. It was a restaurant.\n\nThis Haendl--what to make of him? He should have been disgusting,\nnasty, an abomination. He had no manners whatever. He didn't know, or\nat least didn't use, the Seventeen Conventional Gestures. He wouldn't\nlet Tropile walk behind him and to his left, though he was easily five\nyears Tropile's senior. When he ate, he _ate_. The Sip of Appreciation,\nthe Pause of First Surfeit, the Thrice Proffered Share meant nothing to\nhim. He laughed when Tropile tried to give him the Elder's Portion.\n\nCheerfully patronizing, this man Haendl said to Tropile: \"That stuffs\nall right when you don't have anything better to do with your time.\nThose poor mutts don't. They'd die of boredom without their inky-pinky\ncults and they don't have the resources to do anything bigger. Yes, I\ndo know the Gestures. Seventeen delicate ways of communicating emotions\ntoo refined for words. The hell with them, Tropile. I've got words.\nYou'll learn them, too.\"\n\nTropile ate silently, trying to think.\n\nA man arrived, threw himself in a chair, glanced curiously at Tropile\nand said: \"Haendl, the Somerville Road. The creek backed up when it\nfroze. Flooded bad. Ruined everything.\"\n\nTropile ventured: \"The flood ruined the road?\"\n\n\"The road? No. Say, you must be the fellow Haendl went after. Tropile,\nthat the name?\" He leaned across the table, pumped Tropile's hand. \"We\nhad the road nicely blocked,\" he explained. \"The flood washed it clean.\nNow we have to block it again.\"\n\nHaendl said: \"Take the tractor if you need it.\"\n\nThe man nodded and left.\n\nHaendl said: \"Eat up. We're wasting time. About that road--we keep all\nentrances blocked up, see? Why let a lot of sheep in and out?\"\n\n\"Sheep?\"\n\n\"The opposite,\" said Haendl, \"of Wolves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTake ten billion people and say that, out of every million of them,\none--just one--is different. He has a talent for survival; call him\nWolf. Ten thousand of him in a world of ten billion.\n\nSqueeze them, freeze them, cut them down. Let old Rejoice in Messias\nloom in the terrifying sky and so abduct the Earth that the human race\nis decimated, fractionated, reduced to what is in comparison a bare\nhandful of chilled, stunned survivors. There aren't ten billion people\nin the world any more. No, not by a factor of a thousand. Maybe there\nare as many as ten million, more or less, rattling around in the space\ntheir enormous Elder Generations made for them.\n\nAnd of these ten million, how many are Wolf?\n\nTen thousand.\n\n\"You understand, Tropile?\" said Haendl. \"We survive. I don't care what\nyou call us. The sheep call us Wolves. Me, I kind of call us Supermen.\nWe have a talent for survival.\"\n\nTropile nodded, beginning to understand. \"The way I survived the House\nof the Five Regulations.\"\n\nHaendl gave him a pitying look. \"The way you survived thirty years of\nSheephood before that. Come on.\"\n\nIt was a tour of inspection. They went into a building, big, looking\nlike any other big and useful building of the ancients, gray stone\nwalls, windows with ragged spears of glass. Inside, though, it wasn't\nlike the others. Two sub-basements down, Tropile winced and turned away\nfrom the flood of violet light that poured out of a quartz bull's-eye\non top of a squat steel cone.\n\n\"Perfectly harmless, Tropile--you don't have to worry,\" Haendl boomed.\n\"Know what you're looking at? There's a fusion reactor down there.\nHeat. Power. All the power we need. Do you know what that means?\"\n\nHe stared soberly down at the flaring violet light of the inspection\nport.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said abruptly to Tropile.\n\nAnother building, also big, also gray stone. A cracked inscription over\nthe entrance read: ORIAL HALL OF HUMANITIES. The sense-shock this time\nwas not light; it was sound. Hammering, screeching, rattling, rumbling.\nMen were doing noisy things with metal and machines.\n\n\"Repair shop!\" Haendl yelled. \"See those machines? They belong to our\nman Innison. We've salvaged them from every big factory ruin we could\nfind. Give Innison a piece of metal--any alloy, any shape--and one of\nthose machines will change it into any other shape and damned near any\nother alloy. Drill it, cut it, plane it, weld it, smelt it, zone-melt\nit, bond it--you tell him what to do and he'll do it.\n\n\"We got the parts to make six tractors and forty-one cars out of\nthis shop. And we've got other shops--aircraft in Farmingdale and\nWichita, armaments in Wilmington. Not that we can't make some armaments\nhere. Innison could build you a tank if he had to, complete with\n105-millimeter gun.\"\n\n\"What's a tank?\" Tropile asked.\n\nHaendl only looked at him and said: \"Come on!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlenn Tropile's head spun dizzily and all the spectacles merged and\ndanced in his mind. They were incredible. All of them.\n\nFusion pile, machine shop, vehicular garage, aircraft hangar. There was\na storeroom under the seats of a football stadium, and Tropile's head\nspun on his shoulders again as he tried to count the cases of coffee\nand canned soups and whiskey and beans. There was another storeroom,\nonly this one was called an armory. It was filled with ... guns. Guns\nthat could be loaded with cartridges, of which they had very many; guns\nwhich, when you loaded them and pulled the trigger, would fire.\n\nTropile said, remembering: \"I saw a gun once that still had its firing\npin. But it was rusted solid.\"\n\n\"These work, Tropile,\" said Haendl. \"You can kill a man with them. Some\nof us have.\"\n\n\"_Kill_--\"\n\n\"Get that sheep look out of your eyes, Tropile! What's the difference\nhow you execute a criminal? And what's a criminal but someone who\nrepresents a danger to your world? We prefer a gun instead of the\nDonation of the Spinal Tap, because it's quicker, because it's less\nmessy--and because we don't like to drink spinal fluid, no matter what\nimaginary therapeutic or symbolic value it has. You'll learn.\"\n\nBut he didn't add \"come on.\" They had arrived where they were going.\n\nIt was a small room in the building that housed the armory and it held,\namong other things, a rack of guns.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Haendl, taking one of the guns out of the rack\nthoughtfully and handling it as the doomed Boyne had caressed his\nwatch-case. It was the latest pre-Pyramid-model rifle, anti-personnel,\nshort-range. It would not scatter a cluster of shots in a coffee can at\nmore than two and a half miles.\n\n\"All right,\" said Haendl, stroking the stock. \"You've seen the works,\nTropile. You've lived thirty years with sheep. You've seen what they\nhave and what we have. I don't have to ask you to make a choice. I know\nwhat you choose. The only thing left is to tell you what _we_ want from\n_you_.\"\n\nA faint pulsing began inside Glenn Tropile. \"I expected we'd be getting\nto that.\"\n\n\"Why not? We're not sheep. We don't act that way. Quid pro quo.\nRemember that--it saves time. You've seen the quid. Now we come to the\nquo.\" He leaned forward. \"Tropile, what do you know about the Pyramids?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nHaendl nodded. \"Right. They're all around us and our lives are beggared\nbecause of them. And we don't even know why. We don't have the\nleast idea of what they are. Did you know that one of the sheep was\nTranslated in Wheeling when you left?\"\n\n\"Translated?\"\n\nTropile listened with his mouth open while Haendl told him about what\nhad happened to Citizen Boyne.\n\n\"So he didn't make the Donation after all,\" Tropile said.\n\n\"Might have been better if he had,\" said Haendl. \"Still, it gave you\na chance to get away. We had heard--never mind how just yet--that\nWheeling'd caught itself a Wolf, so we came looking for you. But you\nwere already gone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTropile said, faintly annoyed: \"You were damn near too late.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Tropile,\" Haendl assured him. \"We're never too late. If you\ndon't have enough guts and ingenuity to get away from sheep, you're no\nwolf--simple as that. But there's this Translation. We know it happens,\nbut we don't even know what it is. All we know, people disappear.\nThere's a new sun in the sky every five years or so. Who makes it?\nThe Pyramids. How? We don't know that. Sometimes something floats\naround in the air and we call it an Eye. It has something to do with\nTranslation, something to do with the Pyramids. What? We don't know\nthat.\"\n\n\"We don't know much of anything,\" interrupted Tropile, trying to hurry\nhim along.\n\n\"Not about the Pyramids, no.\" Haendl shook his head. \"Hardly anyone has\never seen one, for that matter.\"\n\n\"Hardly--You mean you have?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. There's a Pyramid on Mount Everest, you know. That's not just\na story. It's true. I've been there, and it's there. At least, it was\nthere five years ago, right after the last Sun Re-creation. I guess it\nhasn't moved. It just sits there.\"\n\nTropile listened, marveling. To have seen a real Pyramid! Almost he had\nthought of them as legends, contrived to account for such established\nphysical facts as the Eyes and Translation, as children with a Santa\nClaus. But this incredible man had seen it!\n\n\"Somebody dropped an H-bomb on it, way back,\" Haendl continued, \"and\nthe only thing that happened is that now the North Col is a crater. You\ncan't move the Pyramid. You can't hurt it. But it's alive. It has been\nthere, alive, for a couple of hundred years; and that's about all we\nknow about the Pyramids. Right?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nHaendl stood up. \"Tropile, that's what all of this is all about!\" He\ngestured around him. \"Guns, tanks, airplanes--we want to know more!\nWe're going to find out more and then we're going to fight.\"\n\nThere was a jarring note and Tropile caught at it, sniffing the air.\nSomehow--perhaps it was his sub-adrenals that told him--this very\npositive, very self-willed man was just the slightest bit unsure of\nhimself. But Haendl swept on and Tropile, for a moment, forgot to be\nalert.\n\n\"We had a party up Mount Everest five years ago,\" Haendl was saying.\n\"We didn't find out a thing. Five years before that, and five years\nbefore _that_--every time there's a sun, while it is still warm enough\nto give a party a chance to climb up the sides--we send a team up\nthere. It's a rough job. We give it to the new boys, Tropile. Like you.\"\n\nThere it was. He was being invited to attack a Pyramid.\n\nTropile hesitated, delicately balanced, trying to get the _feel_ of\nthis negotiation. This was Wolf against Wolf; it was hard. There had to\nbe an advantage--\n\n\"There is an advantage,\" Haendl said aloud.\n\nTropile jumped, but then he remembered: Wolf against Wolf.\n\nHaendl went on: \"What you get out of it is your life, in the first\nplace. You understand you can't get out now. We don't want sheep\nmeddling around. And in the second place, there's a considerable hope\nof gain.\" He stared at Tropile with a dreamer's eyes. \"We don't send\nparties up there for nothing, you know. We want to get something out of\nit. What we want is the Earth.\"\n\n\"The Earth?\" It reeked of madness. But this man wasn't mad.\n\n\"Some day, Tropile, it's going to be us against them. Never mind the\nsheep--they don't count. It's going to be Pyramids and Wolves, and the\nPyramids won't win. And then--\"\n\nIt was enough to curdle the blood. This man was proposing to _fight_,\nand against the invulnerable, the godlike Pyramids.\n\nBut he was glowing and the fever was contagious. Tropile felt his own\nblood begin to pound. Haendl hadn't finished his \"and then--\" but he\ndidn't have to. The \"and then\" was obvious: And then the world takes up\nagain from the day the wandering planet first came into view. And then\nwe go back to our own solar system and an end to the five-year cycle of\nfrost and hunger.\n\nAnd then the Wolves can rule a world worth ruling.\n\nIt was a meretricious appeal, perhaps, but it could not be refused.\nTropile was lost.\n\nHe said: \"You can put away the gun, Haendl. You've signed me up.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nThe way to Mount Everest, Tropile glumly found, lay through supervising\nthe colony's nursery school. It wasn't what he had expected, but it had\nthe advantages that while his charges were learning, he was learning,\ntoo.\n\nOne jump ahead of the three-year-olds, he found that the \"wolves,\" far\nfrom being predators on the \"sheep,\" existed with them in a far more\ncomplicated ecological relationship. There were Wolves all through\nsheepdom; they leavened the dough of society.\n\nIn barbarously simple prose, a primer said: \"The Sons of the Wolf are\ngood at numbers and money. You and your friends play money games almost\nas soon as you can talk, and you can think in percentages and compound\ninterest when you want to. Most people are not able to do this.\"\n\nTrue, thought Tropile subvocally, reading aloud to the tots. That was\nhow it had been with him.\n\n\"Sheep are afraid of the Sons of the Wolf. Those of us who live among\nthem are in constant danger of detection and death--although ordinarily\na Wolf can take care of himself against any number of sheep.\" True, too.\n\n\"It is one of the most dangerous assignments a Wolf can be given to\nlive among the sheep. Yet it is essential. Without us, they would\ndie--of stagnation, of rot, eventually of hunger.\"\n\nIt didn't have to be spelled out any further. Sheep can't mend their\nown fences.\n\nThe prose was horrifyingly bald and the children were horrifyingly--he\nchoked on the word, but managed to form it in his mind--_competitive_.\nThe verbal taboos lingered, he found, after he had broken through the\nbarriers of behavior.\n\nBut it was distressing, in a way. At an age when future Citizens would\nhave been learning their Little Pitcher Ways, these children were\nlearning to fight. The perennial argument about who would get to be Big\nBill Zeckendorf when they played a strange game called \"Zeckendorf and\nHilton\" sometimes ended in bloody noses.\n\nAnd nobody--nobody at all--meditated on Connectivity.\n\nTropile was warned not to do it himself. Haendl said grimly: \"We\ndon't understand it and we don't like what we don't understand. We're\nsuspicious animals, Tropile. As the children grow older, we give\nthem just enough practice so they can go into one meditation and get\nthe feel of it--or pretend to, at any rate. If they have to pass as\nCitizens, they'll need that much. But more than that we do not allow.\"\n\n\"Allow?\" Somehow the word grated; somehow his sub-adrenals began to\npulse.\n\n\"_Allow!_ We have our suspicions and we know for a fact that sometimes\npeople disappear when they meditate. We don't want to disappear. We\nthink it's not a good thing to disappear. Don't meditate, Tropile. You\nhear?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut later, Tropile had to argue the point. He picked a time when\nHaendl was free, or as nearly free as that man ever was. The whole\nadult colony had been out on what they used as a parade ground--it had\nonce been a football field, Haendl said. They had done their regular\ntwice-a-week infantry drill, that being one of the prices one paid for\nliving among the free, progressive Wolves instead of the dull and tepid\nsheep.\n\nTropile was mightily winded, but he cast himself on the ground near\nHaendl, caught his breath and said: \"Haendl--about meditation.\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you don't really grasp it.\"\n\nTropile searched for words. He knew what he wanted to say. How could\nanything that felt as good as Oneness be bad? And wasn't Translation,\nafter all, so rare as hardly to matter? But he wasn't sure he could get\nthrough to Haendl in those terms.\n\nHe tried: \"When you meditate successfully, Haendl, you're one with the\nUniverse. Do you know what I mean? There's no feeling like it. It's\nindescribable peace, beauty, harmony, repose.\"\n\n\"It's the world's cheapest narcotic,\" Haendl snorted.\n\n\"Oh, now, really--\"\n\n\"_And_ the world's cheapest religion. The stone-broke mutts can't\nafford gilded idols, so they use their own navels. That's all it is.\nThey can't afford alcohol; they can't even afford the muscular exertion\nof deep breathing that would throw them into a state of hyperventilated\noxygen drunkenness. Then what's left? Self-hypnosis. Nothing else. It's\nall they can do, so they learn it, they define it as pleasant and good,\nand they're all fixed up.\"\n\nTropile sighed. The man was so stubborn! Then a thought occurred to him\nand he pushed himself up on his elbows. \"Aren't you leaving something\nout? What about Translation?\"\n\nHaendl glowered at him. \"That's the part we don't understand.\"\n\n\"But surely self-hypnosis doesn't account for--\"\n\n\"Surely it doesn't!\" Haendl mimicked savagely. \"All right. We don't\nunderstand it and we're afraid of it. Kindly do not tell me Translation\nis the supreme act of Un-willing, Total Disavowal of Duality, Unison\nwith the Brahm-Ground or any such slop. You don't know what it is and\nneither do we.\" He started to get up. \"All we know is, people vanish.\nAnd we want no part of it, so we don't meditate. None of us--including\nyou!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was foolishness, this close-order drill. Could you defeat the\nunreachable Himalayan Pyramid with a squads-right flanking maneuver?\n\nAnd yet it wasn't all foolishness. Close-order drill and\n2500-calorie-a-day diet began to put fat and flesh and muscle on\nTropile's body, and something other than that on his mind. He had not\nlost the edge of his acquisitiveness, his drive--his whatever it was\nthat made the difference between Wolf and sheep.\n\nBut he had gained something. Happiness? Well, if \"happiness\" is a\nsense of purpose, and a hope that the purpose can be accomplished, then\nhappiness. It was a feeling that had never existed in his life before.\nAlways it had been the glandular compulsion to gain an advantage, and\nthat was gone, or anyway almost gone, because it was permitted in the\nsociety in which he now lived.\n\nGlenn Tropile sang as he putt-putted in his tractor, plowing the\nthawing Jersey fields. Still, a faint doubt remained. Squads right\nagainst the Pyramids?\n\nStiffly, Tropile stopped the tractor, slowed the diesel to a steady\n_thrum_ and got off. It was hot--being midsummer of the five-year\ncalendar the Pyramids had imposed. It was time for rest and maybe\nsomething to eat.\n\nHe sat in the shade of a tree, as farmers always have done, and opened\nhis sandwiches. He was only a mile or so from Princeton, but he might\nas well have been in Limbo; there was no sign of any living human but\nhimself. The northering sheep didn't come near Princeton--it \"happened\"\nthat way, on purpose.\n\nHe caught a glimpse of something moving, but when he stood up for a\nbetter look into the woods on the other side of the field, it was\ngone. Wolf? _Real_ Wolf, that is? It could have been a bear, for that\nmatter--there was talk of wolves and bears around Princeton; and\nalthough Tropile knew that much of the talk was assiduously encouraged\nby men like Haendl, he also knew that some of it was true.\n\nAs long as he was up, he gathered straw from the litter of last\n\"year's\" head-high grass, gathered sticks under the trees, built a\nsmall fire and put water on to boil for coffee. Then he sat back and\nate his sandwiches, thinking.\n\nMaybe it was a promotion, going from the nursery school to labor in\nthe fields. Or maybe it wasn't. Haendl had promised him a place in the\nexpedition that would--maybe--discover something new and great and\nhelpful about the Pyramids. And that might still come to pass, because\nthe expedition was far from ready to leave.\n\nTropile munched his sandwiches thoughtfully. Now _why_ was the\nexpedition so far from ready to leave? It was absolutely essential to\nget there in the warmest weather possible--otherwise Mt. Everest was\nunclimbable. Generations of alpinists had proved that. That warmest\nweather was rapidly going by.\n\nAnd _why_ were Haendl and the Wolf colony so insistent on building\ntanks, arming themselves with rifles, organizing in companies and\nsquads? The H-bomb hadn't flustered the Pyramid. What lesser weapon\ncould?\n\nUneasily, Tropile put a few more sticks on the fire, staring\nthoughtfully into the canteen cup of water. It was a satisfyingly hot\nfire, he noticed abstractedly. The water was very nearly ready to boil.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf across the world, the Pyramid in the Himalays felt, or heard, or\ntasted--a difference.\n\nPossibly the h-f pulses that had gone endlessly wheep, wheep, wheep\nwere now going wheep-_beep_, wheep-_beep_. Possibly the electromagnetic\n\"taste\" of lower-than-red was now spiced with a tang of beyond-violet.\nWhatever the sign was, the Pyramid recognized it.\n\nA part of the crop it tended was ready to harvest.\n\nThe ripening bud had a name, of course, but names didn't matter to the\nPyramid. The man named Tropile didn't know he was ripening, either.\nAll that Tropile knew was that, for the first time in nearly a year,\nhe had succeeded in catching each stage of the nine perfect states of\nwater-coming-to-a-boil in its purest form.\n\nIt was like ... like ... well, it was like nothing that anyone but\na Water Watcher could understand. He observed. He appreciated. He\nencompassed and absorbed the myriad subtle perfections of time, of\nshifting transparency, of sound, of distribution of ebulliency, of the\nfaint, faint odor of steam.\n\nComplete, Glenn Tropile relaxed all his limbs and let his chin rest on\nhis breast-bone.\n\nIt was, he thought with placid, crystalline perception, a rare and\nperfect opportunity for meditation. He thought of Connectivity.\n(Overhead, a shifting glassy flaw appeared in the thin, still air.)\nThere wasn't any thought of Eyes in the erased palimpsest that was\nGlenn Tropile's mind. There wasn't any thought of Pyramids or of\nWolves. The plowed field before him didn't exist. Even the water,\nmerrily bubbling itself dry, was gone from his perception.\n\nHe was beginning to meditate.\n\nTime passed--or stood still--for Tropile; there was no difference.\nThere was no time. He found himself almost on the brink of\nUnderstanding.\n\nSomething snapped. An intruding blue-bottle drone, maybe, or a\ntwitching muscle. Partly, Tropile came back to reality. Almost, he\nglanced upward. Almost, he saw the Eye....\n\nIt didn't matter. The thing that really mattered, the only thing in the\nworld, was all within his mind; and he was ready, he knew, to find it.\n\nOnce more! Try harder!\n\nHe let the mind-clearing unanswerable question drift into his mind:\n\n_If the sound of two hands together is a clapping, what is the sound of\none hand?_\n\nGently he pawed at the question, the symbol of the futility of\nmind--and therefore the gateway to meditation. Unawareness of self was\nstealing deliciously over him.\n\nHe was Glenn Tropile. He was more than that. He was the water\nboiling ... and the boiling water was he. He was the gentle warmth of\nthe fire, which was--which was, yes, itself the arc of the sky. As each\nthing was each other thing; water was fire, and fire air; Tropile was\nthe first simmering bubble and the full roll of Well-aged Water was\nSelf, was--more than Self--was--\n\nThe answer to the unanswerable question was coming clearer and softer\nto him. And then, all at once, but not suddenly, for there was no time,\nit was not close--it _was_.\n\nThe answer was his, was him. The arc of sky was the answer, and the\nanswer belonged to sky--to warmth, to all warmths that there are, and\nto all waters, and--and the answer was--was--\n\nTropile vanished. The mild thunderclap that followed made the flames\ndance and the column of steam fray; and then the fire was steady again,\nand so was the rising steam. But Tropile was gone.\n\n\nVIII\n\nHaendl plodded angrily through the high grass toward the dull throb of\nthe diesel.\n\nMaybe it had been a mistake to take this Glenn Tropile into the colony.\nHe was more Citizen than Wolf--no, cancel that, Haendl thought; he was\nmore Wolf than Citizen. But the Wolf in him was tainted with sheep's\nblood. He _competed_ like a Wolf, but in spite of everything, he\nrefused to give up some of his sheep's ways. Meditation. He had been\ncautioned against that. But had he given it up?\n\nHe had not.\n\nIf it had been entirely up to Haendl, Glenn Tropile would have found\nhimself back among the sheep or dead. Fortunately for Tropile, it\nwas not entirely up to Haendl. The community of Wolves was by no\nmeans a democracy, but the leader had a certain responsibility to his\nconstituents, and the responsibility was this: He couldn't afford to be\nwrong. Like the Old Gray Wolf who protected Mowgli, he had to defend\nhis actions against attack; if he failed to defend, the pack would pull\nhim down.\n\nAnd Innison thought they needed Tropile--not in spite of the taint of\nthe Citizen that he bore, but because of it.\n\nHaendl bawled: \"Tropile! Tropile, where are you?\" There was only the\nwind and the _thrum_ of the diesel. It was enormously irritating.\nHaendl had other things to do than to chase after Glenn Tropile. And\nwhere was he? There was the diesel, idling wastefully; there the end of\nthe patterned furrows Tropile had plowed. There a small fire, burning--\n\nAnd there was Tropile.\n\nHaendl stopped, frozen, his mouth opened, about to yell Tropile's name.\n\nIt was Tropile, all right, staring with concentrated, oyster-eyed gaze\nat the fire and the little pot of water it boiled. Staring. Meditating.\nAnd over his head, like flawed glass in a pane, was the thing Haendl\nfeared most of all things on Earth. It was an Eye.\n\nTropile was on the very verge of being Translated ... whatever that was.\n\nTime, maybe, to find out _what_ that was! Haendl ducked back into the\nshelter of the high grass, knelt, plucked his radio communicator from\nhis pocket, urgently called.\n\n\"Innison! Innison, will somebody, for God's sake, put Innison on!\"\n\nSeconds passed. Voices answered. Then there was Innison.\n\n\"Innison, listen! You wanted to catch Tropile in the act of Meditation?\nAll right, you've got him. The old wheat field, south end, under the\nelms around the creek. Get here fast, Innison--there's an Eye forming\nabove him!\"\n\nLuck! Lucky that they were ready for this, and only by luck, because it\nwas the helicopter that Innison had patiently assembled for the attack\non Everest that was ready now, loaded with instruments, planned to\nweigh and measure the aura around the Pyramid--now at hand when they\nneeded it.\n\nThat was luck, but there was driving hurry involved, too; it was only a\nmatter of minutes before Haendl heard the wobbling drone of the copter,\nsaw the vanes fluttering low over the hedges, dropping to earth behind\nthe elms.\n\nHaendl raised himself cautiously and peered. Yes, Tropile was still\nthere, and the Eye still above him! But the noise of the helicopter had\nfrayed the spell. Tropile stirred. The Eye wavered and shook--\n\nBut did not vanish.\n\nThanking what passed for his God, Haendl scuttled circuitously around\nthe elms and joined Innison at the copter. Innison was furiously\nclosing switches and pointing lenses.\n\nThey saw Tropile sitting there, the Eye growing larger and closer over\nhis head. They had time--plenty of time; oh, nearly a minute of time.\nThey brought to bear on the silent and unknowing form of Glenn Tropile\nevery instrument that the copter carried. They were waiting for Tropile\nto disappear--\n\nHe did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInnison and Haendl hunched at the thunderclap as air rushed in to\nreplace him.\n\n\"We've got what you wanted,\" Haendl said harshly. \"Let's read some\ninstruments.\"\n\nThroughout the Translation, high-tensile magnetic tape on a madly\nspinning drum had been hurtling under twenty-four recording heads at\na hundred feet a second. Output to the recording heads had been from\nevery kind of measuring device they had been able to conceive and\nbuild, all loaded on the helicopter for use on Mount Everest--all now\npointed directly at Glenn Tropile.\n\nThey had, for the instant of Translation, readings from one microsecond\nto the next on the varying electric, gravitational, magnetic, radiant\nand molecular-state conditions in his vicinity.\n\nThey got back to Innison's workshop, and the laboratory inside it, in\nless than a minute; but it took hours of playing back the magnetic\npulses into machines that turned them into scribed curves on coordinate\npaper before Innison had anything resembling an answer.\n\nHe said: \"No mystery. I mean no mystery except the speed. Want to know\nwhat happened to Tropile?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Haendl.\n\n\"A pencil of electrostatic force maintained by a pinch effect bounced\ndown the approximate azimuth of Everest--God knows how they handled the\nelevation--and charged him and the area positive. A _big_ charge, clear\noff the scale. They parted company. He was bounced straight up. A meter\noff the ground, a correcting vector was applied. When last seen, he was\nheaded fast in the direction of the Pyramids' binary--fast! So fast\nthat I would guess he'll get there alive. It takes an appreciable time,\na good part of a second, for his protein to coagulate enough to make\nhim sick and then kill him. If the Pyramids strip the charges off him\nimmediately on arrival, as I should think they will, he'll live.\"\n\n\"Friction--\"\n\n\"Be damned to friction,\" Innison said calmly. \"He carried a packet of\nair with him and there _was_ no friction. How? I don't know. How are\nthey going to keep him alive in space, without the charges that hold\nair? I don't know. If they don't maintain the charges, can they beat\nthe speed of light? I don't know. I can tell you _what_ happened. I\ncan't tell you _how_.\"\n\nHaendl stood up thoughtfully. \"It's something,\" he said grudgingly.\n\n\"It's more than we've ever had--a complete reading at the instant of\nTranslation!\"\n\n\"We'll get more,\" Haendl promised. \"Innison, now that you know what to\nlook for, go on looking for it. Keep every possible detection device\nmonitored twenty-four hours a day. Turn on everything you've got\nthat'll find a sign of imposed modulation. At any sign--or at anybody's\nhunch that there _might_ be a sign--I'm to be called. If I'm eating. If\nI'm sleeping. If I'm enjoying with a woman. Call me, you hear? Maybe\nyou were right about Tropile; maybe he did have some use. He might give\nthe Pyramids a bellyache.\"\n\nInnison, flipping the magnetic tape drum to rewind, said thoughtfully:\n\"It's too bad they've got him. We could have used some more readings.\"\n\n\"Too bad?\" Haendl laughed sharply. \"This time they've got themselves a\nWolf.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Pyramids did have a Wolf--a fact which did not matter in the least\nto them.\n\nIt is not possible to know what \"mattered\" to a Pyramid except by\ninference. But it is possible to know that they had no way of telling\nWolf from Citizen.\n\nThe planet which was their home--Earth's old Moon--was small, dark,\natmosphereless and waterless. It was completely built over, much of it\nwith its propulsion devices.\n\nIn the old days, when technology had followed war, luxury, government\nand leisure, the Pyramids' sun had run out of steam; and at about the\nsame time, they had run out of the Components they imported from a\nneighboring planet. They used the last of their Components to implement\ntheir stolid metaphysic of hauling and pushing. They pushed their\nplanet.\n\nThey knew where to push it.\n\nEach Pyramid as it stood was a radio-astronomy observatory, powerful\nand accurate beyond the wildest dreams of Earthly radio-astronomers.\nFrom this start, they built instruments to aid their naked senses. They\nwent into a kind of hibernation, reducing their activity to a bare\ntrickle except for a small \"crew\" and headed for Earth. They had every\nreason to believe they would find more Components there, and they did.\n\nTropile was one of them. The only thing which set him apart from the\nothers was that he was the most recent to be stockpiled.\n\nThe religion, or vice, or philosophy he practiced made it possible\nfor him to be a Component. Meditation derived from Zen Buddhism was\na windfall for the Pyramids, though, of course, they had no idea at\nall of what lay behind it and did not \"care.\" They knew only that,\nat certain times, certain potential Components became Components\nwhich were no longer merely potential--which were, in fact, ripe for\nharvesting.\n\nIt was useful to them that the minds they cropped were utterly blank.\nIt saved the trouble of blanking them.\n\nTropile had been harvested at the moment his inhibiting conscious mind\nhad been cleared, for the Pyramids were not interested in him as an\nentity capable of will and conception. They used only the raw capacity\nof the human brain and its perceptors.\n\nThey used Rashevsky's Number, the gigantic, far more than astronomical\nexpression that denoted the number of switching operations performable\nwithin the human brain. They used \"subception,\" the phenomenon by which\nthe reasoning mind, uninhibited by consciousness, reacts directly to\nstimuli--shortcutting the cerebral censor, avoiding the weighing of\nshall-I-or-shan't-I that precedes every conscious act.\n\nThe harvested minds were--Components.\n\nIt is not desirable that your bedroom wall switch have a mind of its\nown; if you turn the lights on, you want them _on_. So it was with the\nPyramids.\n\nA Component was needed in the industrial complex which transformed\ncatabolism products into anabolism products.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith long experience gained since their planetfall, Pyramids received\nthe _tabula rasa_ that was Glenn Tropile. He arrived in one piece,\nwearing a blanket of air. Quick-frozen mentally at the moment of inert\nblankness his Meditation had granted him--the psychic drunkard's\ncoma--he was cushioned on repellent charges as he plummeted down, and\ninstantly stripped of surplus electrostatic charge.\n\nAt this point, he was still human; only asleep.\n\nHe remained \"asleep.\" Annular fields they used for lifting and lowering\nseized him and moved him into a snug tank of nutrient fluid. There were\nmany such tanks, ready and waiting.\n\nThe tanks themselves could be moved, and the one containing Glenn\nTropile did move, to a metabolism complex where there were many other\ntanks, all occupied. This was a warm room--the Pyramids had wasted no\nenergy on such foppish comforts in the first \"room.\" In this room,\nGlenn Tropile gradually resumed the appearance of life. His heart once\nagain began to beat. Faint stirrings were visible in his chest as his\nhabit-numbed lungs attempted to breathe. Gradually the stirrings slowed\nand stopped. There was no need for that foppish comfort, either; the\nnutrient fluid supplied all.\n\nTropile was \"wired into circuit.\"\n\nThe only literal wiring, at first, was a temporary one--a fine\nelectrode aseptically introduced into the great nerve that leads to the\nrhinencephalon--the \"small brain,\" the area of the brain which contains\nthe pleasure centers that motivate human behavior.\n\nMore than a thousand Components had been spoiled and discarded before\nthe Pyramids had located the pleasure centers so exactly.\n\nWhile the Component, Tropile, was being \"programmed,\" the wire rewarded\nhim with minute pulses that made his body glow with animal satisfaction\nwhen he functioned correctly. That was all there was to it. After a\ntime, the wire was withdrawn, but by then Tropile had \"learned\" his\nentire task. Conditioned reflexes had been established. They could be\ncounted on for the long and useful life of the Component.\n\nThat life might be very long indeed; in the nutrient tank beside\nTropile's, as it happened, lay a Component with eight legs and a\nchitinous fringe around its eyes. It had lain in such a tank for more\nthan a hundred and twenty-five thousand Terrestrial years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Component was placed in operation. It opened its eyes and saw\nthings. The sensory nerves of its limbs felt things. The muscles of\nits hands and toes operated things.\n\nWhere was Glenn Tropile?\n\nHe was there, all of him, but a zombie-Tropile. Bereft of will, emptied\nof memories. He was a machine and part of a huger machine. His sex\nwas the sex of a photoelectric cell; his politics were those of a\ntransistor; his ambition that of a mercury switch. He didn't know\nanything about sex, or fear, or hope. He only knew two things: Input\nand Output.\n\nInput to him was a display of small lights on a board before his vacant\nface; and also the modulation of a loudspeaker's liquid-borne hum in\neach ear.\n\nOutput from him was the dancing manipulation of certain buttons and\nkeys, prompted by changes in Input and by nothing else.\n\nBetween Input and Output, he lay in the tank, a human Black Box which\nwas capable of Rashevsky's Number of switchings, and of nothing else.\n\nHe had been programmed to accomplish a specific task--to shepherd\na chemical called 3, 7, 12-trihydroxycholanic acid, present in the\ncatabolic product of the Pyramids, through a succession of more than\nfive hundred separate operations until it emerged as the chemical,\nwhich the Pyramids were able to metabolize, called Protoporphin IX.\n\nHe was not the only Component operating in this task; there were\nseveral, each with its own program.\n\nThe acid accumulated in great tanks a mile from him. He knew its\nconcentration, heat and pressure; he knew of all the impurities\nwhich would affect subsequent reactions. His fingers tapped, giving\nbinary-coded signals to sluice gates to open for so many seconds and\nthen to close; for such an amount of solvent at such a temperature to\nflow in; for the agitators to agitate for just so long at just such a\nforce. And if a trouble signal disturbed any one of the 517 major and\nminor operations, he--it?--was set to decide among alternatives:\n\n--scrap the batch in view of flow conditions along the line?\n\n--isolate and bypass the batch through a standby loop?\n\n--immediate action to correct the malfunction?\n\nWithout inhibiting intelligence, without the trammels of humanity on\nhim, the intricate display board and the complex modulations of the two\nsound signals could be instantly taken in, evaluated and given their\nshare in the decision.\n\nWas it--he?--still alive?\n\nThe question has no meaning. It was working. It was an excellent\nmachine, in fact, and the Pyramids cared for it well. Its only\nconsciousness, apart from the reflexive responses that were its\nprogram, was--well, call it \"the sound of one hand alone.\" Which is to\nsay zero, mindlessness, Samadhi, stupor.\n\nIt continued to function for some time--until the required supply of\nProtoporphin IX had been exceeded by a sufficient factor of safety\nto make further processing unnecessary--that is, for some minutes or\nmonths. During that time, it was Happy. (It had been programmed to be\nHappy when there were no uncorrected malfunctions of the process.)\nAt the end of that time, it shut itself off, sent out a signal that\nthe task was completed, then it was laid aside in the analogue of a\ndeep-freeze, to be reprogrammed when another Component was needed.\n\nIt was totally immaterial to the Pyramids that this particular\nComponent had not been stamped from Citizen but from Wolf.\n\n\nIX\n\nRoget Germyn, of Wheeling a Citizen, contemplated his wife with growing\nconcern.\n\nPossibly the events of the past few days had unhinged her reason, but\nhe was nearly sure that she had eaten a portion of the evening meal\nsecretly, in the serving room, before calling him to the table.\n\nHe felt positive that it was only a temporary aberration; she\nwas, after all, a Citizeness, with all that that implied. A--a\ncreature--like that Gala Tropile, for example--someone like that\nmight steal extra portions with craft and guile. You couldn't live\nwith a Wolf for years and not have some of it rub off on you. But not\nCitizeness Germyn.\n\nThere was a light, thrice-repeated tap on the door.\n\nSpeak of the devil, thought Roget Germyn most appropriately; for it was\nthat same Gala Tropile. She entered, her head downcast, looking worn\nand--well, pretty.\n\nHe began formally: \"I give you greeting, Citi--\"\n\n\"They're here!\" she interrupted in desperate haste. Germyn blinked.\n\"Please,\" she begged, \"can't you do something? They're _Wolves_!\"\n\nCitizeness Germyn emitted a muted shriek.\n\n\"You may leave, Citizeness,\" Germyn told her shortly, already forming\nin his mind the words of gentle reproof he would later use. \"Now what\nis all this talk of Wolves?\"\n\nGala Tropile distractedly sat in the chair her hostess had vacated.\n\"We were running away,\" she babbled. \"Glenn--he was Wolf, you see, and\nhe made me leave with him, after the House of the Five Regulations. We\nwere a day's long march from Wheeling and we stopped to rest. And there\nwas an aircraft, Citizen!\"\n\n\"An aircraft!\" Citizen Germyn allowed himself a frown. \"Citizeness, it\nis not well to invent things which are not so.\"\n\n\"I saw it, Citizen! There were men in it. One of them is here again!\nHe came looking for me with another man and I barely escaped him. I'm\nafraid!\"\n\n\"There is no cause for fear, only an opportunity to appreciate,\"\nCitizen Germyn said mechanically--it was what one told one's children.\n\nBut within himself, he was finding it very hard to remain calm. That\nword Wolf--it was a destroyer of calm, an incitement to panic and\nhatred! He remembered Tropile well, and there was Wolf, to be sure. The\nmere fact that Citizen Germyn had doubted his Wolfishness at first was\npowerful cause to be doubly convinced of it now; he had postponed the\nday of reckoning for an enemy of all the world, and there was enough\nsecret guilt in his recollection to set his own heart thumping.\n\n\"Tell me exactly what happened,\" said Citizen Germyn, in words that the\nstress of emotion had already made far less than graceful.\n\nObediently, Gala Tropile said: \"I was returning to my home after the\nevening meal and Citizeness Puffin--she took me in after Citizen\nTropile--after my husband was--\"\n\n\"I understand. You made your home with her.\"\n\n\"Yes. She told me that two men had come to see me. They spoke badly,\nshe said, and I was alarmed. I peered through a window of my home and\nthey were there. One had been in the aircraft I saw! And they flew away\nwith my husband.\"\n\n\"It is a matter of seriousness,\" Citizen Germyn admitted doubtfully.\n\"So then you came here to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, but they saw me, Citizen! And I think they followed. You must\nprotect me--I have no one else!\"\n\n\"If they be Wolf,\" Germyn said calmly, \"we will raise hue and cry\nagainst them. Now will the Citizeness remain here? I go forth to see\nthese men.\"\n\nThere was a graceless hammering on the door.\n\n\"Too late!\" cried Gala Tropile in panic. \"They are here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCitizen Germyn went through the ritual of greeting, of deprecating the\nugliness and poverty of his home, of offering everything he owned to\nhis visitors; it was the way to greet a stranger.\n\nThe two men lacked both courtesy and wit, but they did make an attempt\nto comply with the minimal formal customs of introduction. He had to\ngive them credit for that; and yet it was almost more alarming than if\nthey had blustered and yelled.\n\nFor he knew one of these men.\n\nHe dredged the name out of his memory. It was Haendl. The same man had\nappeared in Wheeling the day Glenn Tropile had been scheduled to make\nthe Donation of the Spinal Tap--and had broken free and escaped. He had\ninquired about Tropile of a good many people, Citizen Germyn included,\nand even at that time, in the excitement of an Amok, a Wolf-finding and\na Translation in a single day, Germyn had wondered at Haendl's lack of\nbreeding and airs.\n\nNow he wondered no longer.\n\nBut the man made no overt act and Citizen Germyn postponed the raising\nof the hue and cry. It was not a thing to be done lightly.\n\n\"Gala Tropile is in this house,\" the man with Haendl said bluntly.\n\nCitizen Germyn managed a Quirked Smile.\n\n\"We want to see her, Germyn. It's about her husband. He--uh--he was\nwith us for a while and something happened.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. The Wolf.\"\n\nThe man flushed and looked at Haendl. Haendl said loudly: \"The Wolf.\nSure he's a Wolf. But he's gone now, so you don't have to worry about\nthat.\"\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"Not just him, but four or five of us. There was a man named Innison\nand he's gone, too. We need help, Germyn. Something about Tropile--God\nknows how it is, but he started something. We want to talk to his wife\nand find out what we can about him. So will you get her out of the back\nroom where she's hiding and bring her here, please?\"\n\nCitizen Germyn quivered. He bent over the ID bracelet that once had\nbelonged to the one PFC Joe Hartman, fingering it to hide his thoughts.\n\nHe said at last: \"Perhaps you are right. Perhaps the Citizeness is with\nmy wife. If this be so, would it not be possible that she is fearful of\nthose who once were with her husband?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHaendl laughed sourly. \"She isn't any more fearful than we are, Germyn.\nI told you about this man Innison who disappeared. He was a Son of\nthe Wolf, you understand me? For that matter--\" He glanced at his\ncompanion, licked his lips and changed his mind about what he had been\ngoing to say next. \"He was a Wolf. Do you ever remember hearing of a\nWolf being Translated before?\"\n\n\"Translated?\" Germyn dropped the ID bracelet. \"But that's impossible!\"\nhe cried, forgetting his manners completely. \"Oh, no! Translation comes\nonly to those who attain the moment of supreme detachment, you can be\nsure of that. I _know_! I've seen it with my own eyes. No Wolf could\n_possibly_--\"\n\n\"At least five Wolves did,\" Haendl said grimly. \"Now you see what the\ntrouble is? Tropile was Translated--I saw that with _my_ own eyes. The\nnext day, Innison. Within a week, two or three others. So we came down\nhere, Germyn, not because we like you people, not because we enjoy it,\nbut because we're _scared_.\n\n\"What we want is to talk to Tropile's wife--you, too, I guess; we want\nto talk to anybody who ever knew him. We want to find out everything\nthere is to find out about Tropile and see if we can make any sense of\nthe answers. Because maybe Translation is the supreme objective of life\nto you people, Germyn, but to us it's just one more way of dying. And\nwe don't want to die.\"\n\nCitizen Germyn bent to pick up his cherished identification bracelet\nand dropped it absently on a table. There was very much on his mind.\n\nHe said at last: \"That is strange. Shall I tell you another strange\nthing?\"\n\nHaendl, looking angry and baffled, nodded.\n\nGermyn said: \"There has been no Translation here since the day the\nWolf, Tropile, escaped. But there have been Eyes. I have seen them\nmyself. It--\" He hesitated, shrugged. \"It has been disturbing. Some of\nour finest Citizens have ceased to Meditate; they have been worrying.\nSo many Eyes and nobody taken! It is outside of all of our experience,\nand our customs have suffered. Politeness is dwindling among us. Even\nin my own household--\"\n\nHe coughed and went on: \"No matter. But these Eyes have come into every\nhome; they have peered about, peered about, and no one has been taken.\nWhy? Is it something to do with the Translation of Wolves?\" He stared\nhopelessly at his visitors. \"All I know is that it is very strange and\ntherefore I am worried.\"\n\n\"Then take us to Gala Tropile,\" said Haendl. \"Let's see what we can\nfind out!\"\n\nCitizen Germyn bowed. He cleared his throat and raised his voice just\nsufficiently to carry from one room to another. \"Citizeness!\" he called.\n\nThere was a pause and then his wife appeared in the doorway, looking\nruffled and ill at ease with her guest.\n\n\"Will you ask if Citizeness Tropile will join us here?\" he requested.\n\nHis wife nodded. \"She is resting. I will call her.\"\n\nThey called her and questioned her for some time.\n\nShe told them nothing.\n\nShe had nothing to tell.\n\n\nX\n\nOn Earth's binary, Glenn Tropile had been reprogrammed for a new task.\n\nThe problem was navigation. Earth had been a disappointment to the\nPyramids; it was necessary to move rapidly to a more rewarding planet.\n\nThe Pyramids had taken Earth out past Pluto's orbit with a simple\nshove, slow and massive. It had been enough merely to approximate the\ndirection in which they would want to go. There would be plenty of time\nfor refinements of course later.\n\nBut now the time for refinements had come, earlier than they might\nhave expected. They had now time to travel, they knew where to--a star\ncluster reasonably sure to be rich in Componentiferous planets. It was\ninherent in the nature of Component mines that eventually they always\nplayed out.\n\nThere were always more mines, though. If that had not been so, it would\nhave been necessary, perhaps, to stock-breed Components against future\nneeds. But it was easier to work the vein out and move on.\n\nNow the course had to be computed. There were such variables to\nbe considered as: motion of the star cluster; acceleration of the\nbinary-planet system; _gravitational influence of every astronomical\nobject in the island universe, without exception_.\n\nPrecise computation on this basis was obviously not practical. That was\nnot an answer to the problem, since the time required would approach\neternity as one of its parameters.\n\nIt was possible to simplify the problem. Only the astronomical bodies\nwhich were relatively nearby need be treated as individuals. Farther\naway, the Pyramids began to group them in small bunches, still farther\nin large bunches, on to the point where the farthest--and the most\nnumerous--bodies were lumped together as a vague gravitational \"noise\"\nwhose average intensity alone it was required to know and to enter as a\ndatum.\n\nAnd still no single Component could handle even its own share of the\nproblem, were the \"computer\" they formed to be kept within the range of\npermissible size.\n\nIt was for this that the Component which had once been Tropile was\ntaken out of storage.\n\nThis was all old stuff to the Pyramids; they knew how to handle it.\nThey broke the problem down to its essentials, separated even those\ninto many parts. There was, for example, the subsection of one certain\naspect of the logistical problem which involved locating and procuring\nadditional Components to handle the load.\n\nEven that tiny specialization was too much for a single Component, but\nfortunately the Pyramids had resources to bring to bear. The procedure\nin such cases was to hitch several Components together.\n\nThis was done.\n\nWhen the Pyramids finished their neuro-surgery, there floated in an\noversized nutrient tank a thing like a great sea-anemone. It was\ncomposed of eight Components--all human, as it happened--arranged in a\ncircle, facing inward, joined temple to temple, brain to brain.\n\nAt their feet, where sixteen eyes could see it, was the display board\nto feed them their Input. Sixteen hands each grasped a molded switch\nto handle their binary-coded Output. There would be no storage of\nthe Output outside of the eight-Component complex itself; it went as\ncontrol signals to the electrostatic generators, funneled through\nthe single Pyramid on Mount Everest, which handled the task of\nComponent-procurement.\n\nThat is, of Translation.\n\nThe programming was slow and thorough. Perhaps the Pyramid which\nfinally activated the octuple unit and went away was pleased with\nitself, not knowing that one of its Components was Glenn Tropile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNirvana. (It pervaded all; there was nothing outside of it.)\n\nNirvana. (Glenn Tropile floated in it as in the amniotic fluid around\nhim.)\n\nNirvana. (The sound of one hand.... Floating oneness.)\n\nThere was an intrusion.\n\nPerfection is completed; by adding to it, it is destroyed. _Duality\nstruck like a thunderbolt. Oneness shattered._\n\nFor Glenn Tropile, it seemed as though his wife were screaming at him\nto wake up. He tried to.\n\nIt was curiously difficult and painful. Timeless poignant sadness, five\nyears of sorrow over a lost love compressed into a microsecond. It was\nalways so, Tropile thought drowsily, awakening. It never lasts. What's\nthe use of worrying over what always happens....\n\nSudden shock and horror rocked him.\n\n_This_ was no ordinary awakening--no ordinary thing at all--_nothing_\nwas as it ever had been before!\n\nTropile opened his mouth and screamed--or thought he did. But there was\nonly a hoarse, faint flutter in his eardrums.\n\nIt was a moment when sanity might have gone. But there was one curious,\nmundane fact that saved him. He was holding something in his hands. He\nfound that he could look at it, and it was a switch. A molded switch,\nmounted on a board, and he was holding one in each hand.\n\nIt was little to cling to, but it at least was real. If his hands could\nbe holding something, then there must be some reality somewhere.\n\nTropile closed his eyes and managed to open them again. Yes, there was\nreality, too. He closed his eyes and light stopped. He opened them and\nlight returned.\n\nThen perhaps he was not dead, as he had thought.\n\nCarefully, stumbling--his mind his only usable tool--he tried to make\nan estimate of his surroundings.\n\nHe could hardly believe what he found.\n\nItem: he could scarcely move. Somehow he was bound by his feet and his\nhead. How? He couldn't tell.\n\nItem: he was bent over and he couldn't straighten. Why? Again he\ncouldn't tell, but it was a fact. The great erecting muscles of his\nback answered his command, but his body would not move.\n\nItem: his eyes saw, but only in a small area.\n\nHe couldn't move his head, either. Still, he could see a few things.\nThe switch in his hand, his feet, a sort of display of lights on a\nstrangely circular board.\n\nThe lights flickered and changed their pattern.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout thinking, he moved a switch. Why? Because it was _right_ to\nmove that switch. When a certain light flared green, a certain switch\nhad to be thrown. Why? Well, when a certain light flared green, a\ncertain switch--\n\nHe abandoned that problem. Never mind why; what the devil was going\n_on_?\n\nGlenn Tropile squinted about him like a mollusc peering out of its\nshell. There was another fact, the oddness of the seeing. What makes it\nlook so queer, he asked himself.\n\nHe found an answer, but it required some time to take it in. He was\nseeing in a strange perspective. One looks out of two eyes. Close one\neye and the world is flat. Open it again and there is a stereoscopic\ndouble; the saliencies of the picture leap forward, the background\nretreats.\n\nSo with the lights on the board--no, not exactly; but something _like_\nthat, he thought. It was as though--he squinted and strained--well, as\nthough he had never really _seen_ before. As though for all his life he\nhad had only one eye, and now he had strangely been given two.\n\nHis visual perception of the board was _total_. He could see all of it\nat once. It had no \"front\" or \"back.\" It was in the round. The natural\nthinking of it was without orientation. He engulfed and comprehended\nit as a unit. It had no secrets of shadow or silhouette.\n\nI think, Tropile mouthed slowly to himself, that I'm going crazy.\n\nBut that was no explanation, either. Mere insanity didn't account for\nwhat he saw.\n\nThen, he asked himself, was he in a state that was _beyond_ Nirvana? He\nremembered, with an odd flash of guilt, that he had been Meditating,\nwatching the stages of boiling water. All right, perhaps he had been\nTranslated. But what was this, then? Were the Meditators wrong in\nteaching that Nirvana was the end--and yet righter than the Wolves,\nwho dismissed Meditation as a phenomenon wholly inside the skull and\nrefused to discuss Translation at all?\n\nThat was a question for which he could find nothing approaching an\nanswer. He turned away from it and looked at his hands.\n\nHe could see them, too, in the round, he noted. He could see every\nwrinkle and pore in all sixteen of them....\n\n_Sixteen hands!_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was the other moment when sanity might have gone. He closed his\neyes. (Sixteen eyes! No wonder the total perception!) And, after a\nwhile, he opened them again.\n\nThe hands were there. All sixteen of them.\n\nCautiously, Tropile selected a finger that seemed familiar in his\nmemory. After a moment's thought, he flexed it. It bent. He selected\nanother. Another--on a different hand this time.\n\nHe could use any or all of the sixteen hands. They were all his, all\nsixteen of them.\n\nI appear, thought Tropile crazily, to be a sort of eight-branched\nsnowflake. Each of my branches is a human body.\n\nHe stirred, and added another datum: I appear also to be in a tank of\nfluid and yet I do not drown.\n\nThere were certain deductions to be made from that. Either someone--the\nPyramids?--had done something to his lungs, or else the fluid was as\ngood an oxygenating medium as air. Or both.\n\nSuddenly a burst of data-lights twinkled on the board below him.\nInstantly and involuntarily, his sixteen hands began working the\nswitches, transmitting complex directions in a lightninglike stream of\non-off clicks.\n\nTropile relaxed and let it happen. He had no choice; the power that\nmade it _right_ to respond to the board made it impossible for his\nbrain to concentrate while the response was going on. Perhaps, he\nthought drowsily, he would never have awakened at all if it had not\nbeen for the long period with no lights....\n\nBut he was awake. And his consciousness began to explore as the task\nended.\n\nHe had had an opportunity to understand something of what was\nhappening. He understood that he was now a part of something larger\nthan himself, beyond doubt something which served and belonged to the\nPyramids. His single brain not being large enough for the job, seven\nothers had been hooked in with it.\n\nBut where were their personalities?\n\nGone, he supposed; presumably they had been Citizens. Sons of the Wolf\ndid not Meditate and therefore were not Translated--except for himself,\nhe corrected wryly, remembering the Meditation on Rainclouds that had\nled him to--\n\nNo, wait!\n\nNot Rainclouds but Water!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTropile caught hold of himself and forced his mind to retrace that\nthought. He _remembered_ the Raincloud Meditation. It had been prompted\nby a particularly noble cumulus of the Ancient Ship type.\n\nAnd this was odd. Tropile had never been deeply interested in\nRainclouds, had never known even the secondary classifications of\nRaincloud types. And he _knew_ that the Ancient Ship was of the fourth\norder of categories.\n\nIt was a false memory.\n\n_It was not his._\n\nTherefore, logically, it was someone else's memory; and being available\nto his own mind, as the fourteen other hands and eyes were available,\nit must belong to--another branch of the snowflake.\n\nHe turned his eyes down and tried to see which of the branches was his\nold body. He found it quickly, with growing excitement. There was the\nleft great toe of his body. He had injured it in boyhood and there was\nno mistaking the way it was bent. Good! It was reassuring.\n\nHe tried to feel the one particular body that led to that familiar toe.\n\nHe succeeded, though not easily. After a time, he became more aware\nof _that_ body--somewhat as a neurotic may become \"stomach conscious\"\nor \"heart conscious.\" But this was no neurosis; it was an intentional\nexploration.\n\nSince that worked, with some uneasiness he transferred his attention to\nanother pair of feet and \"thought\" his way up from them.\n\nIt was embarrassing.\n\nFor the first time in his life, he knew what it felt like to have\nbreasts. For the first time in his life, he knew what it was like to\nhave one's internal organs quite differently shaped and arranged,\nbuttressed and stressed by different muscles. The very faint background\nfeel of man's internal arrangements, never questioned unless something\ngoes wrong with them and they start to hurt, was not at all like the\nfaint background feel that a woman has inside her.\n\nAnd when he concentrated on that feel, it was no faint background to\nhim. It was surprising and upsetting.\n\nHe withdrew his attention--hoping that he would be able to. Gratefully,\nhe became conscious of his own body again. He was still _himself_ if he\nchose to be.\n\nWere the other seven still themselves?\n\nHe reached into his mind--all of it, all eight separate intelligences\nthat were combined within him.\n\n\"Is anybody there?\" he demanded.\n\nNo answer--or nothing he could recognize as an answer. He drove harder\nand there still was none. It was annoying. He resented it as bitterly,\nhe remembered, as in the old days when he had first been learning the\nsubtleties of Ruin Appreciation. There had been a Ruin Master, his name\nforgotten, who had been sometimes less than courteous, had driven hard--\n\nAnother false memory!\n\nHe withdrew and weighed it. Perhaps, he thought, that was a part of\nthe answer. These people, these other seven, would not be driven. The\nattempt to call them back to consciousness would have to be delicate.\nWhen he drove hard, it was painful--he remembered the instant violent\nagony of his own awakening--and they reacted with anguish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMore gently, alert for vagrant \"memories,\" he combed the depths of\nthe eightfold mind within him, reaching into the sleeping portions,\ntouching, handling, sifting and associating, sorting. This memory of\nan old knife wound from an Amok--that was not the Raincloud woman; it\nwas a man, very aged. This faint recollection of a childhood fear of\ndrowning--was that she? It was; it fitted with this other recollection,\nthe long detour on the road south toward the sun, around a river.\n\nThe Raincloud woman was the first to round out in his mind, and the\nfirst he communicated with. He was not surprised to find that, early in\nher life, she had feared that she might be Wolf.\n\nHe reached out for her. It was almost magic--knowing the \"secret\nname\" of a person, so that then he was yours to command. But the\n\"secret name\" was more than that. It was the gestalt of the person.\nIt was the sum of all data and experience, never available to another\nperson--until now.\n\nWith her memories arranged at last in his own mind, he thought\npersuasively: \"Citizeness Alla Narova, will you awaken and speak with\nme?\"\n\nNo answer--only a vague, troubled stirring.\n\nGently he persisted: \"I know you well, Alla Narova. You sometimes\nthought you might be a Daughter of the Wolf, but never really believed\nit because you knew you loved your husband--and thought Wolves did not\nlove. You loved Rainclouds, too. It was when you stood at Beachy Head\nand saw a great cumulus that you went into Meditation--\"\n\nAnd on and on, many times, coaxingly. Even so, it was not easy; but\nat last he began to reach her. Slowly she began to surface. Thoughts\nfaintly sounded in his mind, like echoes at first, his own thoughts\nbouncing back at him, a sort of mental nod of agreement: \"Yes, that is\nso.\" Then--terror. With a shaking fear, a hysterical rush, Citizeness\nAlla Narova came violently up to full consciousness and to panic.\n\nShe was soundlessly screaming. The whole eight-branched figure quivered\nand twisted in its nutrient bath.\n\nThe terrible storm raged in Tropile's own mind as fully as in hers--but\nhe had the advantage of knowing what it was. He helped her. He fought\nit for the two of them ... soothing, explaining, calming.\n\nAt last her branch of the snowflake-body retreated, sobbing for a\nspell. The storm was over.\n\nHe talked to her in his mind and she \"listened.\" She was incredulous,\nbut there was no choice for her; she _had_ to believe.\n\nExhausted and passive, she asked finally: \"What can we do? I wish I\nwere dead!\"\n\nHe told her: \"You were never a coward before. Remember, Alla Narova, I\n_know_ you as nobody has ever known another human being before. That's\nthe way you will know me. As for what we can do--we must begin by\nwaking the others, if we can.\"\n\n\"If not?\"\n\n\"If not,\" Tropile replied grimly, \"then we will think of something\nelse.\"\n\nShe was of tough stuff, he thought admiringly. When she had rested and\nabsorbed things, her spirit was almost that of a Wolf; she had very\nnearly been right about herself.\n\nTogether they explored their twinned members. They found through them\nexactly what task was theirs to do. They found how the electrostatic\nharvesting scythe of the Pyramids was controlled, by and through them.\nThey found what limitations there were and what freedoms they owned.\nThey reached into the other petals of the snowflake, reached past\nthe linked Components into the whole complex of electrostatic field\ngenerators and propulsion machinery, reached even past that into--\n\nInto the great single function of the Pyramids that lay beyond.\n\n\nXI\n\nHaendl was on the ragged edge of breakdown, which was something new in\nhis life.\n\nIt was full hot summer and the hidden colony of Wolves in Princeton\nshould have been full of energy and life. The crops were growing on all\nthe fields nearby; the drained storehouses were being replenished.\n\nThe aircraft that had been so painfully rebuilt and fitted for the\nassault on Mount Everest were standing by, ready to be manned and to\ntake off.\n\nAnd nothing, absolutely nothing, was going right.\n\nIt looked as though there would _be_ no expedition to Everest. Four\ntimes now, Haendl had gathered his forces and been all ready. Four\ntimes, a key man of the expedition had--vanished.\n\nWolves didn't vanish!\n\nAnd yet more than a score of them had. First Tropile--then\nInnison--then two dozen more, by ones and twos. No one was immune. Take\nInnison, for example. There was a man who was Wolf through and through.\nHe was a doer, not a thinker; his skills were the skills of an artisan,\na tinkerer, a jackleg mechanic. How could a man like that succumb to\nthe pallid lure of Meditation?\n\nBut undeniably he had.\n\nIt had reached a point where Haendl himself was red-eyed and jumpy. He\nhad set curious alarms for himself--had enlisted the help of others of\nthe colony to avert the danger of Translation from himself.\n\nWhen he went to bed at night, a lieutenant sat next to his bed,\nwatchfully alert lest Haendl, in that moment of reverie before sleep,\nfell into Meditation and himself be Translated. There was no hour of\nthe day when Haendl permitted himself to be alone; and his companions,\nor guards, were ordered to shake him awake, as violently as need be, at\nthe first hint of an abstracted look in the eyes or a reflective cast\nof the features.\n\nAs time went on, Haendl's self-imposed regime of constant alertness\nbegan to cost him heavily in lost rest and sleep. And the consequences\nof that were--more and more occasions when the bodyguards shook him\nawake; less and less rest.\n\nHe was very close to breakdown indeed.\n\nOn a hot, wet morning a few days after his useless expedition to see\nCitizen Germyn in Wheeling, Haendl ate a tasteless breakfast and,\nreeling with fatigue, set out on a tour of inspection of Princeton.\nWarm rain dripped from low clouds, but that was merely one more\nannoyance to Haendl. He hardly noticed it.\n\nThere were upward of a thousand Wolves in the Community and there\nwere signs of worry on the face of every one of them. Haendl was not\nthe only man in Princeton who had begun laying traps for himself as a\nresult of the unprecedented disappearances; he was not the only one who\nwas short of sleep. When one member in forty disappears, the morale of\nthe whole community receives a shattering blow.\n\nTo Haendl, it was clear, looking into the faces of his compatriots,\nthat not only was it going to be nearly impossible to mount the planned\nassault on the Pyramid on Everest this year, it was going to be\nunbearably difficult merely to keep the community going.\n\nThe whole Wolf pack was on the verge of panic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a confused shouting behind Haendl. Groggily he turned and\nlooked; half a dozen Wolves were yelling and pointing at something in\nthe wet, muggy air.\n\nIt was an Eye, hanging silent and featureless over the center of the\nstreet.\n\nHaendl took a deep breath and mustered command of himself. \"Frampton!\"\nhe ordered one of his lieutenants. \"Get the helicopter with the\ninstruments here. We'll take some more readings.\"\n\nFrampton opened his mouth, then looked more closely at Haendl and,\ninstead, began to talk on his pocket radio. Haendl knew what was in the\nman's mind--it was in his own, too.\n\nWhat was the use of more readings? From the time of Tropile's\nTranslation on, they had had a superfluity of instrument readings on\nthe forces and auras that surrounded the Eyes--yes, and on Translations\nthemselves, too. Before Tropile, there had never been an Eye seen in\nPrinceton, much less an actual Translation. But things were different\nnow. Everything was different. Eyes roamed restlessly around day and\nnight.\n\nSome of the men nearest the Eye were picking up rocks and throwing\nthem at the bobbing vortex in the air. Haendl started to yell at them\nto stop, then changed his mind. The Eye didn't seem to be affected--as\nhe watched, one of the men scored a direct hit with a cobblestone. The\nstone went right through the Eye, without sound or effect; why not let\nthem work off some of their fears in direct action?\n\nThere was a fluttering of vanes and the copter with the instruments\nmounted on it came down in the middle of the street, between Haendl and\nthe Eye.\n\nIt was all very rapid from then on.\n\nThe Eye swooped toward Haendl. He couldn't help it; he ducked. That\nwas useless, but it was also unnecessary, for he saw in a second that\nit was only partly the motion of the Eye toward him that made it loom\nlarger; it was also that the Eye itself was growing.\n\nAn Eye was perhaps the size of a football, as near as anyone could\njudge. This one got bigger, bigger. It was the size of a roc's egg,\nthe size of a whale's blunt head. It stopped and hovered over the\nhelicopter, while the man inside frantically pointed lenses and meters--\n\nThundercrash.\n\nNot a man this time--Translation had gone beyond men. The whole\nhelicopter vanished, man, instruments, spinning vanes and all.\n\nHaendl picked himself up, sweating, shocked beyond sleepiness.\n\nThe young man named Frampton said fearfully: \"Haendl, what do we do\nnow?\"\n\n\"Do?\" Haendl stared at him absently. \"Why, kill ourselves, I guess.\"\n\nHe nodded soberly, as though he had at last attained the solution of a\ndifficult problem. Then he sighed.\n\n\"Well, one thing before that,\" he said. \"I'm going to Wheeling. We\nWolves are licked; maybe the Citizens can help us now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRoget Germyn, of Wheeling, a Citizen, received the message in the\nchambers that served him as a place of business. He had a visitor\nwaiting for him at home.\n\nGermyn was still Citizen and he could not quickly break off the\npleasant and interminable discussion he was having with a prospective\nclient over a potential business arrangement. He apologized for the\ninterruption caused by the message the conventional five times,\nlistened while his guest explained once more the plan he had come to\npropose in full, then turned his cupped hands toward himself in the\ngesture of Denial of Adequacy. It was the closest he could come to\nsaying no.\n\nOn the other side of the desk, the Citizen who had come to propose an\ninvestment scheme immediately changed the subject by inviting Germyn\nand his Citizeness to a Sirius Viewing, the invitation in the form of\nrhymed couplets. He had wanted to transact his business very much, but\nhe couldn't _insist_.\n\nGermyn got out of the invitation by a Conditional Acceptance in proper\nform, and the man left, delayed only slightly by the Four Urgings to\nStay. Almost immediately, Germyn dismissed his clerk and closed his\noffice for the day by tying a triple knot in a length of red cord\nacross the open door.\n\nWhen he got to his home, he found, as he had suspected, that the\nvisitor was Haendl.\n\nThere was much doubt in Citizen Germyn's mind about Haendl. The man had\nnearly admitted to being Wolf, and how could a citizen overlook that?\nBut in the excitement of Gala Tropile's Translation, there had been no\nhue and cry. Germyn had permitted the man to leave. And now?\n\nHe reserved judgment. He found Haendl distastefully sipping tea in\nthe living room and attempting to keep up a formal conversation with\nCitizeness Germyn. He rescued him, took him aside, closed a door--and\nwaited.\n\nHe was astonished at the change in the man. Before, Haendl had been\nbouncy, aggressive, quick-moving--the very qualities least desired in\na Citizen, the mark of the Son of the Wolf. Now he was none of these\nthings, but he looked no more like a Citizen for all that; he was\nhaggard, tense.\n\nHe said, with an absolute minimum of protocol: \"Germyn, the last time I\nsaw you, there was a Translation. Gala Tropile, remember?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" Citizen Germyn said. Remember! It had hardly left his\nthoughts.\n\n\"And you told me there had been others. Are they still going on?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGermyn said: \"There have been others.\" He was trying to speak\ndirectly, to match this man Haendl's speed and forcefulness. It\nwas hardly good manners, but it had occurred to Citizen Germyn\nthat there were times when manners, after all, were not the most\nimportant thing in the world. \"There were two in the past few days.\nOne was a woman--Citizeness Baird; her husband's a teacher. She was\nViewing Through Glass with four or five other women at the time. She\njust--disappeared. She was looking through a green prism at the time,\nif that helps.\"\n\n\"I don't know if it helps or not. Who was the other one?\"\n\nGermyn shrugged. \"A man named Harmane. No one saw it. But they heard\nthe thunderclap, or something like a thunderclap, and he was missing.\"\nHe thought for a moment. \"It is a little unusual, I suppose. Two in a\nweek--\"\n\nHaendl said roughly: \"Listen, Germyn. It isn't just two. In the past\nthirty days, within the area around here and in _one other place_,\nthere have been at least fifty. In _two_ places, do you understand?\nHere and in Princeton. The rest of the world--nothing much; a few\nTranslations here and there. But just in these two communities, fifty.\nDoes that make sense?\"\n\nCitizen Germyn thought. \"--No.\"\n\n\"No. And I'll tell you something else. Three of the--well, victims have\nbeen children under the age of five. One was too young to walk. And the\nmost recent Translation wasn't a person at all. It was a helicopter.\nNow figure that out, Germyn. What's the explanation for Translations?\"\n\nGermyn was gaping. \"Why--you Meditate, you know. On Connectivity. The\nidea is that once you've grasped the Essential Connectivity of All\nThings, you become One with the Cosmic Whole. But I don't see how a\nbaby or a machine--\"\n\n\"No, of course you don't. Remember Glenn Tropile?\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"He's the link,\" Haendl said grimly. \"When he got Translated, we\nthought it was a big help, because he had the consideration to do it\nright under our eyes. We got enough readings to give us a clue as to\nwhat, physically speaking, Translation is all about. That was the first\nreal clue and we thought he'd done us a favor. Now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nHe leaned forward. \"Every person I know of who was Translated was\nsomeone Tropile knew. The three kids were in his class at the nursery\nschool--we put him there for a while to keep him busy, when he first\ncame to us. Two of the men he bunked with are gone; the mess boy who\nserved him is gone; his wife is gone. Meditation? No, Germyn. I know\nmost of those people. Not a damned one of them would have spent a\nmoment Meditating on Connectivity to save his life. And what do you\nmake of that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwallowing hard, Germyn said: \"I just remembered. That man Harmane--\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"The one who was Translated last week. He also knew Tropile. He was the\nKeeper of the House of the Five Regulations when Tropile was there.\"\n\n\"You see? And I'll bet the woman knew Tropile, too.\" Haendl got up\nfretfully, pacing around. \"Here's the thing, Germyn. I'm licked. You\nknow what I am, don't you?\"\n\nGermyn said levelly: \"I believe you to be Wolf.\"\n\n\"You believe right. That doesn't matter any more. You don't like\nWolves. Well, I don't like you. But this thing is too big for me to\ncare about that any more. Tropile has started something happening,\nand what the end of it is going to be, I can't tell. But I know this:\nWe're not safe, either of us. Maybe you still think Translation is\na fulfillment. I don't; it scares me. _But it's going to happen to\nme_--and to you. It's going to happen to everybody who ever had\nanything to do with Glenn Tropile, unless we can somehow stop it--and I\ndon't know how. Will you help me?\"\n\nGermyn, trying not to tremble when all his buried fears screamed\n_Wolf!_, said honestly: \"I'll have to sleep on it.\"\n\nHaendl looked at him for a moment. Then he shrugged. Almost to himself,\nhe said: \"Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe we can't do anything about it\nanyhow. All right. I'll come back in the morning, and if you've made up\nyour mind to help, we'll start trying to make plans. And if you've made\nup your mind the other way--well, I guess I'll have to fight off a few\nCitizens. Not that I mind that.\"\n\nGermyn stood up and bowed. He began the ritual Four Urgings.\n\n\"Spare me that,\" Haendl growled. \"Meanwhile, Germyn, if I were you, I\nwouldn't make any long-range plans. You may not be here to carry them\nout.\"\n\nGermyn asked thoughtfully: \"And if you were _you_?\"\n\n\"I'm not making any,\" Haendl said grimly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCitizen Germyn, feeling utterly tainted with the scent of the Wolf\nin his home, tossed in his bed, sleepless. His eyes were wide open,\nstaring at the dark ceiling. He could hear his wife's decorous\nbreathing from the foot of the bed--soft and regular, it should have\nbeen lulling him to sleep.\n\nIt was not. Sleep was very far away.\n\nGermyn was a brave enough man, as courage is measured among Citizens.\nThat is to say, he had never been afraid, though it was true that there\nhad been very little occasion. But he was afraid now. He didn't want to\nbe Translated.\n\nThe Wolf, Haendl, had put his finger on it: _Perhaps you still think\nTranslation is a fulfillment._ Translation--the reward of Meditation,\nthe gift bestowed on only a handful of gloriously transfigured persons.\nThat was one thing. But the sort of Translation that was now involved\nwas nothing like that--not if it happened to children; not if it\nhappened to Gala Tropile; not if it happened to a machine.\n\nAnd Glenn Tropile was involved in it.\n\nGermyn turned restlessly.\n\nIf people who knew Glenn Tropile were likely to be Translated, and\npeople who Meditated on Connectivity were likely to be Translated, then\npeople who knew Glenn Tropile and didn't want to be Translated had\nbetter not Meditate on Connectivity.\n\nIt was very difficult to _not_ think of Connectivity.\n\nEndlessly he calculated sums in arithmetic in his mind, recited the\nFive Regulations, composed Greeting Poems and Verses on Viewing.\nAnd endlessly he kept coming back to Tropile, to Translation, to\nConnectivity. He didn't _want_ to be Translated. But still the thought\nhad a certain lure. What was it like? Did it hurt?\n\nWell, probably not, he speculated. It was very fast, according to\nHaendl's report--if you could believe what an admitted Son of the Wolf\nreported. But Germyn had to.\n\nWell, if it was fast--at that kind of speed, he thought, perhaps you\nwould die instantly. Maybe Tropile was dead. Was that possible? No, it\ndidn't seem so; after all, there was the fact of the connection between\nTropile and so many of the recently Translated. What was the connection\nthere? Or, generalizing, what connections were involved in--\n\nHe rescued himself from the dread word and summoned up the first image\nthat came to mind. It happened to be Tropile's wife--Gala Tropile, who\nhad disappeared herself, in this very room.\n\nGala Tropile. He stuck close to the thought of her, a little pleased\nwith himself. That was the trick of _not_ thinking of Connectivity--to\nthink so hard and fully of something else as to leave no room in the\nmind for the unwanted thought. He pictured every line of her face,\nevery wave of her stringy hair....\n\nIt was very easy that way. He was pleased.\n\n\nXII\n\nOn Mount Everest, the sullen stream of off-and-on responses that was\n\"mind\" to the Pyramid had taken note of a new input signal.\n\nIt was not a critical mind. Its only curiosity was a restless urge to\nshove-and-haul, and there was no shove-and-haul about what to it was\nperhaps the analogue of a man's hunger pang. The input signal said: _Do\nthus._ It obeyed.\n\nCall it craving for a new flavor. Where once it had patiently waited\nfor the state that Citizens knew as Meditation on Connectivity, and the\nPyramid itself perhaps knew as a stage of ripeness in the fruits of its\nwristwatch mine, now it wanted a different taste. Unripe? Overripe? At\nany rate, different.\n\nAccordingly, the high-frequency wheep, wheep changed in tempo and in\nkey, and the bouncing echoes changed and ... there was a ripe one to be\nplucked. (Its name was Innison.) And there another. (Gala Tropile.)\nAnd another, another--oh, many others--a babe from Tropile's nursery\nschool and the Wheeling jailer and a woman Tropile once had coveted on\nthe street.\n\nOnce the ruddy starch-to-sugar mark of ripeness had been what human\nbeings called Meditation on Connectivity and the Pyramids knew as\na convenient blankness. Now the sign was a sort of empathy with\nthe Component named Tropile. It didn't matter to the Pyramid on\nMount Everest. It swung its electrostatic scythe and the--call them\nTropiletropes--were harvested.\n\nIt did not occur to the Pyramid on Mount Everest that a Component might\nbe directing its actions. How could it?\n\nPerhaps the Pyramid on Mount Everest wondered, if it knew how to\nwonder, when it noticed that different criteria were involved in\nselecting components these days. If it knew how to \"notice.\" Surely\neven a Pyramid might wonder when, without warning or explanation,\nits orders were changed--not merely to harvest a different sort of\nComponent, but to drag along with the flesh-and-blood needful parts\na clanking assortment of machinery and metal, as began to happen.\nMachines? Why would the Pyramids need to Translate machines?\n\nBut why, on the other hand, would a Pyramid bother to question a\ndirective, even if it were able to?\n\nIn any case, it didn't. It swung its scythe and gathered in what it was\ncaused to gather in.\n\nMen sometimes eat green fruit and come to regret it. Was it the same\nwith Pyramids?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Citizen Germyn fell into the unsuspected trap. Avoiding\nConnectivity, he thought of Glenn Tropile--and the unfelt h-f pulses\nfound him out.\n\nHe didn't see the Eye that formed above him. He didn't feel the\ngathering of forces that formed his trap. He didn't know that he was\nseized, charged, catapulted through space, caught, halted and drained.\nIt happened too fast.\n\nOne moment he was in his bed; the next moment he was--elsewhere. There\nwasn't anything in between.\n\nIt had happened to hundreds of thousands of Components before him, but,\nfor Citizen Germyn, what happened was in some ways different. He was\nnot embalmed in nutrient fluid, formed and programmed to take his part\nin the Pyramid-structure, for he had not been selected by the Pyramid\nbut by that single wild Component, Tropile. He arrived conscious, awake\nand able to move.\n\nHe stood up in a red-lit chamber. Vast thundering crashes of metal\nbuffeted his ears. Heat sprang little founts of perspiration on his\nskin.\n\nIt was too much, too much to take in at once. Oily-skinned madmen,\nnaked, were capering and shouting at him. It took him a moment to\nrealize that they were not devils; this was not Hell; he was not dead.\n\n\"This way!\" they were bawling at him. \"Come on, hurry it up!\"\n\nHe reeled, following their directions, across an unpleasantly warm\nfloor, staggering and falling--the binary planet was a quarter denser\nthan Earth--until he got his balance.\n\nThe capering madmen led him through a door--or sphincter or trap;\nit was not like anything he had ever seen. But it was a portal of a\nsort, and on the other side of it was something closer to sanity. It\nwas another room, and though the light was still red, it was a paler,\ncalmer red and the thundering ironmongery was a wall away. The madmen\nwere naked, yes, but they were not mad. The oil on their skins was only\nthe sheen of sweat.\n\n\"Where--where am I?\" he gasped.\n\nTwo voices, perhaps three or four, were all talking at once. He could\nmake no sense of it. Citizen Germyn looked about him. He was in a sort\nof chamber that formed a part of a machine that existed for the unknown\npurposes of the Pyramids on the binary planet. And he was alive--and\nnot even alone.\n\nHe had crossed more than a million miles of space without feeling a\nthing. But when what the naked men were saying began to penetrate, the\nwalls lurched around him.\n\nIt was true; he had been Translated.\n\nHe looked dazedly down at his own bare body, and around at the room,\nand then he realized they were still talking: \"--when you get your\nbearings. Feel all right now? Come on, Citizen, snap out of it!\"\n\nGermyn blinked.\n\nAnother voice said peevishly: \"Tropile's got to find some other place\nto bring them in. That foundry isn't meant for human beings. Look at\nthe shape this one is in! Some time somebody's going to come in and we\nwon't spot him in time and--pfut!\"\n\nThe first voice said: \"Can't be helped. Hey! Are you all right?\"\n\nCitizen Germyn looked at the naked man in front of him and took a deep\nbreath of hot, sour air. \"Of course I'm all right,\" he said.\n\nThe naked man was Haendl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Tropile-petal \"said\" to the Alla Narova-petal: \"Got another one!\nIt's Citizen Germyn!\" The petal fluttered feebly in soundless laughter.\n\nThe Alla Narova-petal \"said\": \"Glenn, come back! The whole\npropulsion-pneuma just went out of circuit!\"\n\nTropile pulled his attention away from his human acquisitions in\nthe chamber off the foundry and allowed himself to fuse with the\nwoman-personality. Together they reached out and explored along the\npathways they had laboriously traced. The propulsion-pneuma was the\ncomplex of navigation-computers, drive generators, course-vectoring\nunits that their own unit had been originally part of--until Glenn\nTropile, by waking its Components, had managed to divert it for\npurposes of his own. The two of them reached out into it--\n\nDead end.\n\nIt was out of circuit, as Alla Narova had said. One whole limb of their\nbody--their new, jointly tenanted body, that spanned a whole planet and\nreached across space to Earth--had been lopped off. Quick, quick, they\nseparated, traced separate paths. They came together again: Still dead\nend.\n\nThe dyad that was Tropile and the woman reached out to touch the others\nin the snowflake and communicated--not in words, not in anything as\nslow and as opaque as words: _The Pyramids have lopped off another\ncircuit._ The compound personality of the snowflake considered its\ncourse of action, reached its decision, acted. Quick, quick, three of\nthe other members of the snowflake darted out of the collective unit\nand went about isolating and tracing the exact area that had been\naffected.\n\nTropile: \"We expected this. They couldn't help noticing sooner or\nlater that something was going wrong.\"\n\nAlla Narova: \"But, Glenn, suppose they cut _us_ out of circuit? We're\nstuck here. We can't move. We can't get out of the tanks. If they know\nthat we are the source of their trouble--\"\n\nTropile: \"Let them know! That's what we've got the others here for!\" He\nwas cocky now, self-assured, fighting. For the first time in his life,\nhe was free to fight--to let his Wolf blood strive to the utmost--and\nhe knew what he was fighting for. This wasn't a matter of Haendl's\npitiful tanks and carbines against the invulnerable Pyramids; this was\nthe invulnerability of the whole Pyramid system turned against the\nPyramids!\n\nIt was a warning, the fact that the Pyramids had become alert to\ndanger, had begun cutting sections of their planetary communications\nsystem out of the main circuit. But as a warning, it didn't frighten\nTropile; it only spurred him to action.\n\nQuick, quick, he and the woman-personality dissolved, sped away.\nFiguratively they sought out the most restive Components they could\nfind, shook them by the shoulder, tried to wake them. Actually--well,\nwhat is \"actually?\" The physical fact was surely that they didn't\nmove at all, for they were bound to their tank and to the surgical\njoinings, each to each, at their temples. No crawling child in a\nplaypen was more helplessly confined than Tropile and Alla Narova and\nthe others.\n\nAnd yet no human being had ever been more free.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRegard that imbecile servant of Everyman, the thermostat.\n\nHe runs the furnace in Everyman's house, he measures the doneness of\nEveryman's breakfast toast, he valves the cooling fluid through the\nradiator of Everyman's car. If Everyman's house stays too hot or too\ncold, the man swears at the lackwit switch and maybe buys a new one\nto plug in. But he never, never thinks that his thermostat might be\nplotting against him.\n\nThermostat : Man = Man : Pyramid. Only that and nothing more. It was\nnot in the nature of a Pyramid to think that its Components, once\ninstalled, could reprogram themselves. No Component ever had. (But\nbefore Glenn Tropile, no Component had been Wolf.)\n\nWhen Tropile found himself, he found others. They were men and women,\nreal persons with gonads and dreams. They had been caught at the moment\nof blankness--yes; and frozen into that shape, true. But they were\npalimpsest personalities on which the Pyramids had programmed their\nduties. Underneath the Pyramids' cabalistic scrawl, the men and women\nstill remained. They had only to be reached.\n\nTropile and Alla Narova reached them--one at a time, then by scores.\nThe Pyramids made that possible. The network of communication that they\nhad created for their own purposes encompassed every cell of the race\nand all its works. Tropile reached out from his floating snowflake\nand went where he wished--anywhere within the binary planet; to the\nbrooding Pyramid on Earth; through the Eyes, wherever he chose on\nEarth's surface.\n\nPhysically, he was scarcely able to move a muscle. But, oh, the soaring\nrange of his mind and vision!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCitizen Germyn was past shock, but just the same it was uncomfortable\nto be in a room with several dozen other persons, all of them naked.\nUncomfortable. Once it would have been brain-shattering. For a Citizen\nto see his own Citizeness unclothed was gross lechery. To be part of a\nmixed and bare-skinned group was unthinkable. Or had been. Now it only\nmade him uneasy.\n\nHe said numbly to Haendl: \"Citizen, I pray you tell me what sort of\nplace this is.\"\n\n\"Later,\" said Haendl gruffly, and led him out of the way. \"Stay put,\"\nhe advised. \"We're busy.\"\n\nAnd that was true. Something was going on, but Citizen Germyn couldn't\nmake out exactly what it was. The naked people were worrying out a\ndistribution of some sort of supplies. There were tools and there were\nalso what looked to Citizen Germyn's unsophisticated eyes very much\nlike guns. Guns? It was foolishness to think they were guns, Citizen\nGermyn told himself strongly. _Nobody_ had guns. He touched the floor\nwith an exploratory hand. It was warm and it shook with a nameless\ndistant vibration. He shuddered.\n\nHaendl came back; yes, they were guns. Haendl was carrying one.\n\n\"Ours!\" he crowed. \"That Tropile must've looted our armory at\nPrinceton. By the looks of what's here, I doubt if he left a single\nround of ammunition. What the hell, they're more use here!\"\n\n\"But what are we going to do with _guns_?\"\n\nHaendl looked at him with savage amusement. \"Shoot.\"\n\nCitizen Germyn said: \"Please, Citizen. Tell me what this is all about.\"\n\nHaendl sat down next to him on the warm, quivering floor and began\nfitting cartridges into a clip.\n\n\"We're fighting,\" he explained gleefully. \"Tropile did it all. You've\nbeen shanghaied and so have all the rest of us. Tropile's alive! He's\npart of the Pyramid communications network--don't ask me how. But he's\nthere and he has been hauling men and weapons and God knows what all up\nfrom Earth--you're on the binary planet now, you know--and we're going\nto bust things up so the Pyramids will _never_ be able to put them back\ntogether again. Understand? Well, it doesn't matter if you don't. All\nyou have to understand is that when I tell you to shoot this gun, you\nshoot.\"\n\nNumbly, Citizen Germyn took the unfamiliar stock and barrel into his\nhands. Muscles he had forgotten he owned straightened the limp curve of\nhis back, squared his shoulders and thrust out his chest.\n\nIt had been many generations since any of Citizen Germyn's people had\nknown the feeling of being an Armed Man.\n\nA naked woman with wild hair and a full, soft figure came toward them,\njiggling in a way that agonized Citizen Germyn. He dropped his eyes to\nhis gun and kept them there.\n\nShe cried: \"Orders from Tropile! We've got to form a party and blow\nsomething up.\"\n\nHaendl demanded: \"Such as what?\"\n\n\"I don't know what. I only know where. We've got a guide. And Tropile\nparticularly asked for you, Haendl. He said you'd enjoy it.\"\n\nAnd enjoy it Haendl did--anticipation was all over his face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey formed a party of a dozen. They armed themselves with the guns\nTropile had levitated from the bulging warehouse at Princeton. They\nsupplied themselves with gray metal cans of something that Haendl said\nwere explosives, and with fuses and detonators to match, and they set\noff--with their guide.\n\nA guide! It was a shambling, fearsome monster!\n\nWhen Citizen Germyn saw it, he had to fight an almost irresistible\ntemptation to be ill. Even the bare skins about him no longer mattered;\nthis new horror canceled them out.\n\n\"What--What--\" he strangled, pointing.\n\nHaendl laughed raucously. \"That's Joey.\"\n\n\"What's Joey?\"\n\n\"He works for us,\" said Haendl, grinning.\n\nJoey was neither human nor beast; it was not Pyramid; it was nothing\nCitizen Germyn had ever seen or imagined before. It crouched on\nmany-jointed limbs, and even so was twice the height of a man. Its ropy\narms and legs were covered with fine chitinous spines, laid on as close\nas hairs in a pelt, and sharp as thorns. There was a layer of chitin\naround its reddish eyes. What was more horrible than all, it spoke.\n\nIt said squeakily: \"You all ready? Come on, snap it up! The Pyramids\nhave got something big building up and we've got to squash it.\"\n\nCitizen Germyn whispered feverishly to Haendl: \"That voice! It sounds\nodd, yes--but isn't it Tropile's voice?\"\n\n\"Sure it is! That's what old Joey is good for,\" said Haendl. \"Tropile\nsays he's telepathic, whatever that is. Makes it handy for us.\"\n\nAnd it did. Telepathy was the alien's very special use to Glenn\nTropile, for what Joey was in fact was another Component, from a\nprevious wristwatch mine. Joey's planet had once circled a star never\nvisible from Earth; his home air was thin and his home sunlight was\nweak, and in consequence his race had developed a species of telepathy\nfor communicating at long range. This was handy for the Pyramids,\nbecause it simplified the wiring. And it was equally handy for Glenn\nTropile, once he managed to wake the creature--with its permission, he\ncould use its body as a sort of walkie-talkie in directing the tactics\nof his shanghaied army.\n\nThat permission was very readily given. Joey remembered what the\nPyramids had done to its own planet.\n\n\"Come on!\" ordered Joey in Tropile's filtered voice, and they hastened\nthrough a straight and achingly cramped tunnel in single file, toward\nwhat Tropile had said was their target.\n\nThey had nearly reached it when, abruptly, there was a thundering of\nexplosions ahead.\n\nThe party stopped, looked at each other, and got ready to move on more\nslowly.\n\nAt last it had started. The Pyramids were beginning to fight back.\n\n\nXIII\n\nCitizeness Roget Germyn, widow, woke from sleep like a well-mannered\ncat on the narrow lower third of the bed that her training had taught\nher to occupy, though it had been some days since her husband's\nTranslation had emptied the Citizen's two-thirds permanently.\n\nSomeone had tapped gently on her door.\n\n\"I am awake,\" she called, in a voice just sufficient to carry.\n\nA quiet voice said: \"Citizeness, there is exceptional opportunity to\nAppreciate this morning. Come see, if you will. And I ask forgiveness\nfor waking you.\"\n\nShe recognized the voice; it was the wife of one of her neighbors.\nThe Citizeness made the appropriate reply, combining forgiveness and\ngratitude.\n\nShe dressed rapidly, but with appropriate pauses for reflection and\ncalm, and stepped out into the street.\n\nIt was not yet daylight. Overhead, great sheets of soundless lightnings\nflared.\n\nInside Citizeness Germyn long-unfelt emotions stirred. There was\nsomething that was very like terror, and something that was akin to\nlove. This was a generation that had never seen the aurora, for the\nricocheting electron beams that cause it could not span the increasing\ndistance between the orphaned Earth and its primary, Old Sol, and the\nsmall rekindled suns the Pyramids made were far too puny.\n\nUnder the sleeting aurora, small knots of Citizens stood about the\nstreets, their faces turned up to the sky and illuminated by the\ndistant light. It was truly an exceptional opportunity to Appreciate\nand they were all making the most of it.\n\nConscientiously, Citizeness Germyn sought out another viewer with whom\nto exchange comments on the spectacle above. \"It is more bright than\nmeteors,\" she said judiciously, \"and lovelier than the freshly kindled\nSun.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the woman. Citizeness Germyn, jolted, looked more closely.\nIt was the Tropile woman--Gala? Was that her name? And what sort of\nname was _that_? But it fitted her well; she was the one who had been\nwife to Wolf and, more likely than not, part Wolf herself.\n\nStill, the case was not proved. Citizeness Germyn said honestly: \"I\nhave never seen a sight to compare with this in all my life.\"\n\nGala Tropile said indifferently: \"Yeah. Funny things are happening all\nthe time these days, have you noticed? Ever since Glenn turned out to\nbe--\" She stopped.\n\nCitizeness Germyn rapidly diagnosed her embarrassment and acted to\ncover it up. \"That is so. I have seen Eyes a hundred times and yet\nhas there been a Translation with the Eyes? No. But there have been\nTranslations. It is queer.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Gala Tropile said, looking upward at the display. She\nsighed.\n\nOver their heads, a formed Eye was drifting slowly about, but neither\nof the women noticed it. The shifting lights in the sky obscured it.\n\n\"I wonder what causes that stuff,\" Gala Tropile said idly.\n\nCitizeness Germyn made no attempt to answer. It was not the sort of\nquestion that would normally have occurred to her and therefore not a\nsort to which she could reply.\n\nMoreover, it was not the question closest to Gala Tropile's heart at\nthat moment--nor, for that matter, the question closest to Citizeness\nGermyn's. The question that underlay the thoughts of both was: _I\nwonder what happened to my husband._\n\nIt was strange, but true, that the answers to all their questions were\nvery nearly the same.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Alla-Narova mind said sharply: \"Glenn, come back!\"\n\nTropile withdrew from scanning the distant dark street. He laughed\nsoundlessly. \"I was watching my wife. God, we're giving them fits down\nthere! The Pyramids must be churning things up, too--the sky is full of\nauroral displays. Looks like there's plenty of h-f bouncing around the\natmosphere.\"\n\n\"Pay attention!\" the Alla-Narova mind commanded.\n\n\"All right.\" Obediently, Tropile returned to the war he was waging.\n\nIt was a strange conflict, strangely fought. Tropile's mind searched\nthe abysses and tunnels of the Pyramid planet, and what he sensed or\nsaw was immediately communicated to all of the awakened Components who\nwere his allies.\n\nIt was a godlike position. Was he sane? There was no knowing. Sanity\nno longer meant anything to Tropile. He was beyond such human affairs\nas lunacy or its reverse. An insane man is one who is out of joint\nwith his environment. Tropile was himself his environment. His mind\nencompassed two planets and the space between. He saw with a thousand\neyes. He worked with a thousand hands.\n\nAnd he struck mighty blows.\n\nThe weakness of a network that reaches everywhere is that it is\neverywhere vulnerable. If a teletype repeater in Omaha garbles a single\ndigit, printing units in Atlanta and Bangor will type out errors.\nTropile, by striking at the Pyramids' net at a thousand points, garbled\ntheir communications and made them nearly useless. More, he took the\nPyramid network for his own. The Tropile-pulse sped through the neurone\nguides of the Pyramid net, and what it encountered it mastered, and\nwhat it mastered it changed.\n\nThe Pyramids discovered that they had been attacked.\n\nFrantically (if they felt frenzy), the Pyramids replaced Components;\nthe Tropile-pulse woke the new ones. Unbelievingly (did they know\nhow to \"believe\"?), the Pyramids isolated contaminated circuits; the\nTropile-pulse bypassed them.\n\nDesperately (or joyously or uffishly--one term fits exactly as well as\nanother), the Pyramids returned to shove-and-haul, and there was much\ndestruction, and some Components died.\n\nBut by then, the Components had reprogrammed themselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first job had been the matter of finding hands for the\nTropile-brain to work with. Bring hands in, then! Tropile commanded\nthe Pyramids' network and obediently it was done. The Translation\nmechanism, the electrostatic scythe that had harvested so many crops\nfrom the wristwatch mines, suffered a change and went to work not for\nthe pickers but for the fruit.\n\nThe essential change in the operation of that particular pneuma had\nbeen simple; first, to \"harvest\" or \"Translate\" the men and women\nTropile wanted as fighters instead of the meditative Citizen kind.\nSecond, to divert the new arrivals to where they would not go straight\nto deep-freeze. It happened that the only alternate space Tropile could\nfind was a sort of foundry that was nearly Hell, but that was only a\ndetail. The important thing was that new helpers were arriving, with\nminds of their own and the capacity to move and act.\n\nThen Tropile needed to communicate with them. He found the alien,\nropy-limbed Component whose name vaguely approached \"Joey.\" Joey's\nlimited sense of telepathy was needed and so, with enormous difficulty,\nTropile and Alla Narova, combined, managed to reach and wake it.\n\nAnd so he had an army, captured humans for troops, an awakened Joey\nfor liaison.\n\nTropile was lord of two worlds. Not only the Pyramids were under his\nthumb, but his own fellow humans whom he had drafted into his service.\nThey ate when a captured circuit he controlled fed synthetic mush into\ntroughs for them. They breathed because a captured circuit he directed\ncreated air. They would return to Earth when--and only when--a captured\ncircuit he operated sent them home.\n\nSane?\n\nBy what standards?\n\nAnd what difference did it make?\n\n\nXIV\n\nWith a series of grinding shocks, like an enormous earthquake-fault\nrelieving a strain, the Pyramids began to fight back.\n\n\"Tropile!\" the Alla-Narova mind called urgently.\n\nTropile flashed to the trouble spot. Through eyes that were not his\nown, Tropile scanned the honeycombed world of the Pyramids. There was\nan area where huge and ancient vehicles lay covered with the slow dust\nof centuries, and the vehicles were beginning to move.\n\nCaterpillar-treaded hauling machines were loading themselves with what\nTropile judged were quickly synthesized explosives. Almost forgotten\nwheeled vehicles were creeping mindlessly out of nearly abandoned\nstorage sections and lumbering painfully along the tunnels of the\nplanet.\n\n\"Coming toward us,\" Tropile diagnosed dispassionately.\n\nAlla Narova queried: \"They mean to fight?\"\n\n\"Of course. You see if you can penetrate the circuit that controls\nthem. I--\" already he was flashing away--\"I'll get to the boys through\nJoey.\"\n\nIt was queer, looking through the eyes of the alien they called Joey;\ncolors were all wrong, perspective was flat. But he could see, though\ncloudily. He saw Haendl joyously fitting a bayonet--_a bayonet!_--to\na rifle; he saw Citizen Germyn, naked but square-shouldered, puffing\nvaliantly along in the rear.\n\nTropile said through the strange vocal cords that belonged to the\nalien: \"You'll have to hurry.\" (Strange to speak in words again!) \"The\nPyramids are heading toward the chambers where the Components are kept.\nI think they mean to kill us.\"\n\nHe flashed away, located the area, flashed back. \"You'll have to go\nwithout me--I mean without Joey-me. The only way I see to get there is\nthrough a narrow little ventilation tunnel--I guess ventilation is what\nit was for.\"\n\nQuickly (but against the familiar race of thought, it seemed\nagonizingly slow) he laid out the route for them and left; it was up\nto them. Watching from a dozen viewpoints at once, he saw the slow\ncreep of the Pyramids' machines and the slower intersecting march of\nhis little army. He studied the alternate cross routes and contrived\nto block some of them by interfering with the control-circuits of the\nemergency doors and portals.\n\nBut there were some circuits he could not control. The Pyramids\nhad withdrawn whole sections of their net and areas of the\nplanet were now hidden from him entirely. Sections of the vast\nmaintenance-propulsion-manufacturing complex were no longer subject to\nhis interference or control.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt would be, Tropile thought dispassionately, a rather close thing.\nThe chances were perhaps six out of ten that his hastily assembled\ntask force would be able to intercept the convoy of automatic machines\nbefore it could reach the racks of nutrient tanks.\n\nAnd if they were not in time?\n\nTropile almost laughed out loud, if that had been possible. Why, then,\nhis body would be destroyed! How trivial a thing to worry about! He\nbegan to forget he owned a body; surely it was someone else's bone and\ntissue that lay floating in the eight-branched snowflake. He knew that\nthis was not so. He knew that if his body were killed, he would die.\nAnd yet there was no sense of fear, no personal involvement. It was an\ninteresting problem in scheduling and nothing more.\n\nWould the human fighters get there in time?\n\nPerhaps the automatic machines had senses, for as the first of the\nhumans burst into the tunnel they were using, a few hundred yards ahead\nof the lead load-carrier, the machines shuddered to a stop. Pause for\na second; then, laboriously, they began to back toward the nearest of\nthe side passages that Tropile had been unable to block. He scanned it\nhurriedly. Good, good! The circuits surrounding the passage proper were\nout of his reach, but it led to another passage, an abandoned pipeline\nof sorts, it seemed to be. And _that_ he could reach....\n\nPatiently (how slowly the machines crept along!) he waited until one of\nthe Pyramids' machines bearing explosives passed through an enormous\nvalve in the line--and then the valve was thrown.\n\nThe explosion triggered every vehicle in the line. The damage was\ncomplete.\n\nScratch one threat from the Pyramids--\n\nAnd almost at once, there was another urgent call from Alia Narova:\n\"Tropile, quickly!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Pyramids were the mightiest race of warriors the Universe had ever\nknown. They were invulnerable and unconquerable, except from within.\nLike Alexander the Great, they had met every enemy and whipped them\nall. And, like dying Alexander, they writhed and raged against the\ntiny, unseen bacillus within themselves.\n\nBlindly, almost suicidally, the Pyramids returned to their ancient\nprinciple of shove-and-haul.\n\nThe geography of the binary planet was like a hive of bees, nearly\nfeatureless on the surface, but internally a congeries of tunnels,\nchambers, warrens, rooms, tubes and amphitheaters. Machinery and metal\nComponents were everywhere thick under the planet's crust. The more\ndelicate and more useful Components of flesh and blood were, to a\ndegree, concentrated in a few areas....\n\nAnd one of those areas had disappeared.\n\nTropile, battering futilely with his mind at the periphery of the\nvanished area, cried sharply to Alla Narova and the others: \"It looks\nas though they've broken a piece right out of the planet! Everything\nstops here--there's a physical gap which I can't cross. Hurry, one of\nyou--what was this section for?\"\n\n\"Propulsion.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Tropile hesitated, confused for the first time since his\nawakening. \"Wait.\"\n\nHe retreated to the snowflake and communed with the other\neight-branched members, now become something that resembled his general\nstaff. He told them--most of them already knew, but the telling took so\nlittle time that it was simpler to go through it from beginning to end:\n\n\"The Pyramids attempted to cut the propulsion-pneuma out of circuit\nsome seconds or days ago and were unsuccessful; we awakened additional\nComponents and were able to maintain contact with it. They have now\napparently cut it loose from the planet itself. I do not think it is\nfar, but there is a physical space between.\"\n\n\"The importance of the propulsion-pneuma is this: It controls the\nmaster generators of electrostatic force, which are used both to\nmove this planet and ours, and to perform the act of Translation. If\nthe Pyramids control it, they may be able to take us out of circuit,\nperhaps back to Earth, perhaps throwing us into space, where we will\ndie. The question for decision: How can we counteract this move?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA rush of voices all spoke at once; it was no trick for Tropile and the\nothers to sort them out and follow the arguments of each, but it cannot\nbe reproduced.\n\nAt last, one said: \"There is a way. I will do it.\"\n\nIt was Alla Narova.\n\n\"What is the way?\" Tropile demanded, curiously alarmed.\n\n\"I shall go with them, trace the areas the Pyramids are attempting to\nisolate, place my entire self--\" by this she meant her \"concentration,\"\nher \"psyche,\" that part of all of them which flashed along the neurone\nguides unhampered by flesh or distance--\"in the most likely point they\nwill next cut loose. And then I shall cause the propulsion units on the\nsevered sections to force them back into circuit.\"\n\nTropile objected: \"But you don't know what will happen! We have never\nbeen cut off from our physical bodies, Alla Narova. It may be death. It\nmay not be possible at all. You don't know!\"\n\nAlla Narova thought a smile and a farewell. She said: \"No, I do not.\"\nAnd then, \"Good-by, Tropile.\"\n\nShe had gone.\n\nFuriously, Tropile hurled himself after her, but she was quick as\nhe, too quick to catch; she was gone. _Foolishness, foolishness!_ he\nshouted silently. How could she do an insane, chancy thing like this?\n\nAnd yet what else was there to do? They were all ignorant babes,\ntemporarily successful because there had been no defense against them,\nfor who expects babes to rise up in rebellion? They didn't _know_.\nFor all they could guess or imagine, the Pyramids had an effective\ncounter for any move they might make. Temporary success meant nothing.\nIt was the final decision that counted, when either the Pyramids were\nvanquished or the men, and what steps were needed to make that decision\nfavor the men were anyone's guess--Alla Narova's was as good as his.\n\nTropile could only watch and wait.\n\nThrough a great many viewpoints and observers, he was able to see\nroughly what happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a section of the planet next the severed chunk where the mind\nand senses of Alla Narova lay coiled for a moment--and were gone. For\nwhat it had accomplished, her purpose succeeded. She had been taken.\nShe was out of circuit.\n\nThe overwhelming consciousness of loss that flooded through Glenn\nTropile was something outside of all his experience.\n\nNext to him in the snowflake, the body which he had learned to think\nof as the body of Alla Narova twisted sharply as though waking from a\ndream--and lay flaccid, floating in the fluid.\n\n\"Alla Narova! _Alla Narova!_\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nA voice came piercingly: \"Tropile! Here now, quickly!\"\n\nGood-by, Alla Narova! He flashed away to see what the other voice had\nfound. Great mindless boulders were chipping away from the crust of the\nbinary planet and whirling like midges in the void around it.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried one of the others.\n\nTropile had no answer. It was the Pyramids, clearly. Were they\nattempting to demolish their own planet? Were they digging away at the\ncrust to uncover the maggot's-nest of awakened Components beneath?\n\n\"The air!\" cried Tropile sharply, and knew it was true. What the\nPyramids were up to was a simple delousing operation. If you could\ndestroy their own machinery for maintaining air and pressure and\ntemperature, they would destroy all living things within--including\nHaendl and Citizen Germyn and thus, in the final analysis, including\nthe bodies of Tropile and his awakened fellows. For without the mobile\ntroops to defend their helpless cocoons against the machines of the\nPyramids, the limp bodies could be destroyed as easily as a larva under\na farmer's heel.\n\nSo Alla Narova had failed.\n\nAlone against the Pyramids, she had been unable to bring the recaptured\nsections back into the circuit that Tropile's Components now dominated.\nIt was the end of hope; but it was not the fear of defeat and\ndamnation for the Earth that paralyzed Tropile. It was Alla Narova,\ngone from him forever.\n\nThe Pyramids were too strong.\n\nAnd yet, he thought, quickening, they had been too strong before and\nstill a weak spot had been found!\n\n\"Think,\" he ordered himself desperately.\n\nAnd then again: \"Think!\" Components stirred restlessly around him,\nquestioning. \"Think!\" he cried mightily. \"All of you, think! Think of\nyour lives and hopes!\n\n\"Think!\n\n\"Hope!\n\n\"Worry!\n\n\"Dream!\"\n\nThe Components were reaching toward him now, wonderingly. He commanded\nthem violently: \"Do it--concentrate, wish, think! Let your minds run\nfree and think of Earth, pleasant grass and warm sun! Think of loving\nand sweat and heartbreak! Think of death and birth! _Think_, for the\nlove of heaven, _think_!\"\n\nAnd the answer was not in sound, but it was deafening.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the cut-off sections, Alla Narova's soaring mind lay trapped. It\nhad not been enough; she could not force her will against the dull\ninflexibility of the Pyramids....\n\nUntil that inflexible will began to waver.\n\nThere was a leakage of thought.\n\nIt maddened and baffled the Pyramids. The whole neuronic network was\nresounding to a babble of thoughts and emotions that, to a Pyramid,\nwere utterly demented! The rousing Component minds throbbed with urge\nand emotion that were new to Pyramid experience. What could a Pyramid\nmake of a human's sex drive? Or of the ropy-armed aliens' passionate\ndeification of the Egg? What of hunger and thirst and the blazing\nWolf-need for odds and advantage that streamed out of such as Tropile?\n\nThey wavered, unsure. Their reactions were slow and very confused.\n\nFor Alla Narova succeeded in her purpose. She was able to reach out\nacross the space and barrier to Tropile and the propulsion-pneuma was\nback in circuit. The section that controlled the master generators of\nthe electronic scythe lay under his hands.\n\n\"Now!\" he cried, and all of the Components reached out to grasp and\nmove.\n\n\"Now!\" And the central control was theirs; the full flood of power from\nthe generators was at their command.\n\n\"Now! Now! Now!\" And they reached out, with a fat pencil of\nelectrostatic force and caught the sluggish, brooding Pyramid on Mount\nEverest.\n\nIt had squatted there without motion for more than two centuries. Now\nit quivered and seemed to draw back, but the probing pencil caught\nit, and whirled it, and hurled it up and out of Earth, into the tiny\nartificial sun.\n\nIt struck with a flare of blue-white light.\n\n\"One gone!\" gloated Tropile. \"Alla Narova, are you there?\"\n\n\"Still here,\" she called from a great distance. \"Again?\"\n\n\"Again!\"\n\nThey reached for the Pyramids and found them, wherever they were. Some\nlay close to the surface of the binary planet, and some were hundreds\nof miles within, and a few, more desperate than the others or merely\nassigned to the task, they discovered at the very portal of the single\nspaceship of the Pyramids.\n\nBut wherever they were and whatever they chose to do, each one of them\nwas found and seized. They came wriggling and shaking, like trout\non an angler's line. They came bursting through layer on layer of\nimpenetrable metal that, nevertheless, they penetrated. They came by\nthe dozens and scores, and at last by the thousands; but they came.\n\nThere were more and more flares of blue-white light on the tiny sun--so\nmany that Tropile found himself scouring the planet in a desperate\nsearch for one surviving Pyramid--not to destroy as an enemy, but to\nkeep for a specimen.\n\nBut he searched in vain.\n\nThe Pyramids were destroyed, gone. There was not one left. The Earth\nlay open and free under its tiny sun for the first time in centuries.\n\nIt had been a strange war, but a short one.\n\nAnd it was over.\n\n\nXIV\n\nTropile swam up out of hammering blackness into daylight and pain.\n\nIt _hurt_. He was being born again--coming back to life--and it had\nall the agonies of parturition, except that they were visited upon the\ncreature being born, himself. There were crushing blows at his temples\nthat pounded and pained like no other ache he had ever felt. He moaned\nraspingly.\n\nSomeone moved blurrily over his shut eyes. He felt something sting\nsharply at the base of his brain. Then it tingled, warming his scalp,\ncomforting it, numbing it. Pain went slowly away.\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\nFour masked torturers were leaning over him. He stared, not\nunderstanding; but the eyes were not torturers' eyes, and in a moment\nthe masks came off. Surgical masks--and the faces beneath the masks\nwere human faces.\n\nSurgeons and nurses.\n\nHe blinked at them and said groggily: \"Where am we?\" And then he\nremembered.\n\nHe was back on Earth; he was merely human again.\n\nSomeone came bustling into the room and he knew without looking that it\nwas Haendl.\n\n\"We beat them, Tropile!\" Haendl cried. \"No, cancel that. _You_ beat\nthem. We've destroyed every Pyramid there was, and a nice hot fire\nthey're making up there on the sun, eh? Beautiful work, Tropile.\nBeautiful! You're a credit to the name of Wolf!\"\n\nThe surgeons stirred uneasily, but apparently, Tropile thought, there\nhad been changes, for they did no more than that.\n\nTropile touched his temples fretfully and his fingers rested on gauze\nbandages. It was true: he was out of circuit. The long reach of his\nawareness was cut short at his skull; there was no more of the infinite\nsweep and grasp he had known as part of the snowflake in the nutrient\nfluid.\n\n\"Too bad,\" he whispered hopelessly.\n\n\"What?\" Haendl frowned. The nurse next to him whispered something and\nhe nodded. \"Oh, I see. You're still a little groggy, right? Well,\nthat's not hard to understand--they tell me it was a tricky job of\nsurgery, separating you from that gunk the Pyramids had wired into\nyour head.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tropile, and closed his ears, though Haendl went on\ntalking. After a while, Tropile pushed himself up and swung his legs\nover the side of the operating table. He was naked. Once that would\nhave bothered him enormously, but now it didn't seem to matter.\n\n\"Find me some clothes, will you?\" he asked. \"I'm back. I might as well\nstart getting used to it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlenn Tropile found that he was a returning hero, attracting a curious\nsort of hero-worship wherever he went. It was not, he thought after\ncareful analysis, _exactly_ what he might have expected. For instance,\na man who went out and killed a dragon in the old days was received\nwith great gratitude and rejoicing, and if there was a prince's\ndaughter around, he married her. Fair enough, after all. And Tropile\nhad slain a foe more potent than any number of dragons.\n\nBut he tested the attention he received and found no gratitude in it.\nIt was odd.\n\nWhat it was like most of all, he thought, was the sort of attention a\nreigning baseball champion might get--in a country where cricket was\nthe national game. He had done something which, everybody agreed, was\nan astonishing feat, but about which nobody seemed to care. Indeed,\nthere was an area of accusation in some of the attention he got.\n\nItem: nearly ninety thousand erstwhile Components had now been brought\nback to ambient life, most of them with their families long dead, all\nof them a certain drain on the limited resources of the planet. And\nwhat was Glenn Tropile going to do about it?\n\nItem: the old distinctions between Citizen and Wolf no longer made much\nsense now that so many Componentized Citizens had fought shoulder to\nshoulder with Componentized Sons of the Wolf. But didn't Glenn Tropile\nthink he had gone a little too far _there_?\n\nAnd item--looking pretty far ahead, of course, but still--well, just\nwhat _was_ Glenn Tropile going to do about providing a new sun for\nEarth, when the old one wore out and there would be no Pyramids to tend\nthe fire?\n\nHe sought refuge with someone who would understand him. That, he was\npleased to realize, was easy. He had come to know several persons\nextremely well. Loneliness, the tortured loneliness of his youth, was\npermanently behind him, _definitely_.\n\nFor example, he could seek out Haendl, who would understand everything\nvery well.\n\nHaendl said: \"It is a bit of a letdown, I suppose. Well, hell with\nit; that's life.\" He laughed grimly. \"Now that we've got rid of the\nPyramids, there's plenty of other work to be done. Man, we can breathe\nnow! We can plan ahead! This planet has maundered along in its stupid,\nrutted, bogged-down course too many years already, eh? It's time we\ntook over! And we'll be doing it, I promise you. You know, Tropile--\"\nhe sniggered--\"I only regret one thing.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Tropile asked cautiously.\n\n\"All those weapons, out of reach! Oh, I'm not _blaming_ you. But you\ncan see what a lot of trouble it's going to be now, stocking up all\nover again--and there isn't much we can do about bringing order to\nthis tired old world, is there, until we've got the guns to do it with\nagain?\"\n\nTropile left him much sooner than he had planned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCitizen Germyn, then? The man had fought well, if nothing else. Tropile\nwent to find him and, for a moment at least, it was very good. Germyn\nsaid: \"I've been doing a lot of thinking, Tropile. I'm glad you're\nhere.\" He sent his wife for refreshments, and decorously she brought\nthem in, waited for exactly one minute, and then absented herself.\n\nTropile burst into speech as soon as she left. \"I'm beginning to\nrealize what has happened to the human race, Germyn. I don't mean just\nnow, when we licked the Pyramids and so on. No, I mean hundreds of\nyears ago, what happened when the Pyramids arrived, and what has been\nhappening since. Did you ever hear of Indians, Germyn?\"\n\nGermyn frowned minutely and shrugged.\n\n\"They were, oh, hundreds _and_ hundreds of years ago. They were a\ndifferent color and not very civilized--of course, nobody was then. But\nthe Indians were nomads, herdsmen, hunters--like that. And the white\npeople came from Europe and wanted this country for themselves. So they\ntook it. And do you know something? I don't think the Indians ever knew\nwhat hit them.\"\n\n\"_They_ didn't know about land grants and claiming territory for the\ncrown and church missions and expanding populations. They didn't have\nthose things. It's true that they learned pretty well, by and by--at\nleast they learned things like guns and horses and firewater; they\ndidn't have those things, either, but they could see some sense to\nthem, you know. But I really don't think the Indians ever knew exactly\nwhat the Europeans were up to, until it was too late to matter.\n\n\"And it was the same with us and the Pyramids, only more so. What\nthe devil _did_ they want? I mean, yes, we found out what they did\nwith the Translated people. But what were they _up_ to? What did\nthey _think_? _Did_ they think? You know, I've got a kind of a crazy\nidea--maybe it's not crazy, maybe it's the truth. Anyway, I've been\nthinking. Suppose even the _Pyramids_ weren't the Pyramids? We never\ntalked to one of them. We never gave it a Rorschach or tested its knee\njerks. We licked them, but we don't know anything about them. We don't\neven know if they were the guys that started the whole bloody thing, or\nif they were just sort of super-sized Components themselves. Do we?\n\n\"And meanwhile, here's the human race, up against something that it not\nonly can't understand, same as the Indians couldn't the whites, but\nthat it can't begin to make a _guess_ about. At least the Indians had\na clue now and then, you know--I mean they'd see the sailors off the\ngreat white devil ship making a beeline for the Indian women and so on,\nand they'd begin to understand there was _something_ in common. But we\ndidn't have that much.\n\n\"So what did we do? Why, we did like the reservation Indians. We turned\ninward. We got loaded on firewater--Meditation--and we closed our minds\nto the possibility of ever expanding again. And there we were, all\ntied up in our own knots. Most of the race rebelled against action,\nbecause it had proven useless--Citizens. A few of the race rebelled\nagainst _that_, because it was not only useless but _deliberately_\nuseless--Wolves. But they're the same kind of people. You've seen that\nfor yourself, right? And--\"\n\nTropile stopped, suddenly aware that Citizen Germyn was looking tepidly\npained.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Tropile demanded harshly.\n\nCitizen Germyn gave him the faint deprecatory Quirked Smile. \"I know\nyou thought you were a Wolf, but--I told you I've been thinking a lot,\nand that's what I was thinking about. _Truly_, Citizen, you do yourself\nno good by pretending that you really thought you were Wolf. Clearly\nyou were not; the rest of us might have been fooled, but certainly you\ncouldn't fool yourself.\n\n\"Now here's what I think you ought to do. When I found you were coming,\nI asked several rather well-known Citizens to come here later this\nevening. There won't be any embarrassment. I only want you to talk to\nthem and set the record straight, so that this terrible blemish will no\nlonger be held against you. Times change and perhaps a certain latitude\nis advisable now, but certainly you don't want--\"\n\nTropile also left Citizen Germyn sooner than he had expected to.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere remained Alla Narova, but, queerly, she was not to be found.\n\nInstantly it became clear to Tropile that it was she above all whom he\nneeded to talk to. He remembered the shared beauty of their plunging\ndrive through the neurone-guides of the Pyramids, the linked and\ninextricable flow of their thoughts and of their most hidden feelings.\n\nShe could not be very far, he thought numbly, cursing the blindness of\nhis human eyes, the narrowness of his human senses. Time was when two\nworlds could not have hidden her from him; but that time was gone. He\nwalked from place to place with the angry resentful tread of one used\nto riding--no, to flying, or faster than flying. He asked after her. He\nsearched.\n\nAnd at last he found--not her. A note. At one of the stations where the\nre-awakened Components were funneled back into human affairs, there was\na letter waiting for him:\n\n    _I'm sure you will look for me. Please don't. You thought that\n    there were no secrets between us, but there was one._\n\n    _When I was Translated, I was sixty-one years old. Two years before\n    that, I was caught in a collapsing building; my legs are useless,\n    and I had grown quite fat. I do not want you to see me fat and\n    old._\n\n    _Alla Narova._\n\nAnd that was that, and at last Glenn Tropile turned to the last person\nof all those on his list who had known him well. Her name was Gala\nTropile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had got thinner, he observed. They sat together quietly and there\nwas considerable awkwardness, but then he noticed that she was weeping.\nComforting her ended the awkwardness and he found that he was talking:\n\n\"It was like being a god, Gala! I swear, there's no feeling like it.\nI mean it's like--well, maybe if you'd just had a baby, and invented\nfire, and moved a mountain, and transmuted lead into gold--maybe if\nyou'd done all of those things, then you might have some idea. But I\nwas everywhere at once, Gala, and I could do anything! I fought a whole\nworld of Pyramids, do you realize that? Me! And now I come back to--\"\n\nHe stopped her in time; it seemed she was about to weep again.\n\nHe went on: \"No, Gala, don't misunderstand, I don't hold anything\nagainst you. You were right to leave me in the field. What did I have\nto offer you? Or myself, for that matter? And I don't know that I have\nanything now, but--\"\n\nHe slammed his fist against the table. \"They talk about putting the\nEarth back in its orbit! Why? And how? My God, Gala, we don't know\n_where_ we are. Maybe we could tinker up the gadgets the Pyramids used\nand turn our course backward--but do you know what Old Sol looks like?\nI don't. I never saw it.\n\n\"And neither did you or anyone else alive.\n\n\"It was like being a god--\n\n\"And they talk about going back to things as they were--\n\n\"I'm sick of that kind of thinking! Wolves or Citizens, they're dead on\ntheir feet and don't know it. I suppose they'll snap out of it in time,\nbut I can't wait. I won't live that long.\n\n\"Unless--\"\n\nHe paused and looked at her, confused.\n\nGala Tropile met her husband's eyes.\n\n\"Unless what, Glenn?\"\n\nHe shrugged and turned away.\n\n\"Unless you go back, you mean.\" He stared at her; she nodded. \"You want\nto go back,\" she said, without stress. \"You don't want to stay here\nwith me, do you? You want to go back into that tub of soup again and\nfloat like a baby. You don't want to _have_ babies--you want to _be_\none.\"\n\n\"Gala, you don't understand. We can own the Universe. I mean mankind\ncan. And I can do it. Why not? There's nothing for me--\"\n\n\"That's right, Glenn. There's nothing for you here. Not any more.\"\n\nHe opened his mouth to speak, looked at her, spread his hands\nhelplessly. He didn't look back as he walked out the door, but he knew\nthat his back was turned not only on the woman who happened to be his\nwife, but on mankind and all of the flesh.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was night outside, and warm. Tropile stood in the old street\nsurrounded by the low, battered houses--and he could make them new and\ngrand! He looked up at the stars that swung in constellations too new\nand changeable to have names. _There_ was the Universe.\n\nWords were no good; there was no explaining things in words. Naturally\nhe couldn't make Gala or anyone else understand, for flesh couldn't\ngrasp the realities of mind and spirit that were liberated from flesh.\nBabies! A home! And the whole grubby animal business of eating and\ndrinking and sleeping! How could anyone ask to stay in the mire when\nthe stars challenged overhead?\n\nHe walked slowly down the street, alone in the night, an apprentice\ngodling renouncing mortality. There was nothing here for him, so why\nthis sense of loss?\n\nDuty said (or was it Pride?): \"Someone must give up the flesh to\ncontrol Earth's orbit and weather--why not you?\"\n\nFlesh said (or was it his soul--whatever that was?): \"But you will be\n_alone_.\"\n\nHe stopped, and for a moment he was poised between destiny and the\ndust....\n\nUntil he became aware of footsteps behind him, running, and Gala's\nvoice: \"Wait! Wait, Glenn! I want to go with you!\"\n\nAnd he turned and waited, but only until she caught up, and then he\nwent on.\n\nBut not--forever and always again--not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Wolfbane, by Frederik Pohl and C.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
