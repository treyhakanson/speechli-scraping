Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\nU.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\n\n\n\n\nSavagely cursing, Luke Fenton reeled backward from the porthole, his\ngreat hairy paws clapped over his eyes. No one had warned him, and he\ndid not know that total blindness might result from gazing too earnestly\ninto the sun's unscreened flaming orb, especially with that body not\nmore than twenty million miles distant in space.\n\n[Sidenote: Mighty Luke Fenton swaggers defiantly in Vulcan's Workshop,\nmost frightful of Martian prisons.]\n\nHe did not know, in fact, that the ethership was that close: Luke had\nnot the faintest notion of the vast distances of the universe or of the\nabsence of air in space which permitted the full intensity of the\ndazzling rays to strike into his optics unfiltered save by the thick but\nclear glass which covered the port. He knew only that the sun, evidently\nvery near, was many times its usual size and of infinitely greater\nbrilliance. And he was painfully aware of the fact that the\nfantastically enlarged and blazing body had seared his eyeballs and\ncaused the floating black spots which now completely obscured his\nvision.\n\nStumbling in his blindness, he fell across the hard cot that was the\nsole article of furniture in the cell he had occupied for more than two\nweeks. Lying there half dazed and with splitting head, he cursed the\nguard who had opened the inner cover of the port; cursed anew the\nfish-eyed Martian judge who had sentenced him to a term in Vulcan's\nWorkshop.\n\nSeveral of Luke's thirty-eight years had been spent in jails and sundry\nother penal institutions devised by Earthman and Martian for the\npunishment of offenders against the laws of organized society. And yet\nthey had failed to break his defiant spirit or to convince him of the\ninfallibility of his creed that might makes right. Nor had they taken\nfrom him the gorillalike strength that was in his broad squat body, the\nmagnificent brute lustihood that made him a terror to police and citizen\nalike. Instead, the many periods of incarceration had only served to\nincrease his hatred of mankind and his contempt of the forces of law and\norder. Especially was he contemptuous of the book-learning that gave the\nauthorities their power.\n\nAs the pain back of his eyes abated, Luke could see dimly the shaft of\nlight that slanted down from the porthole to the bare steel floor. His\nsight was returning, yet he lay there still, growling in his throat, his\nmind occupied with thoughts of his checkered past.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nSteel-worker, mechanic, roustabout, he had worked in most of the\npopulous cities of Earth and had managed to get into serious trouble\nwherever he went. It was his boast that he had never killed a man except\nin fair fight. And yet, at thirty, finding himself wanted by the police\nof a half dozen cities of Earth, he had signed up in the black gang of a\ntramp ethership bound for Mars, knowing he would never return and caring\nnot at all.\n\nAt first, he had been riotously happy in the changed life on the new\nworld. There had been plenty of soul-satisfying brawls and plenty of\nchulco, the fiery Martian distillate. On his many and frequent jobs\nthere were excellent opportunities to rebel against authority, and he\nhad fomented numerous mutinies in which he was always victorious but\nwhich usually landed him in one of the malodorous Martian jails for a\nmore or less extended stay.\n\nThen had come that final fracas in the Copau foundry on the bank of\nCanal Pyramus. Overly optimistic, Luke's new boss had struck out at the\nchunky, red-headed Earthman during an inconsequential argument and had\npromptly measured his length in a sand pile as a hamlike fist crashed\nhome in return. They had picked up the foreman and taken him to the\ninfirmary where it was found that his skull was fractured and that he\nhad little chance for life. There were the red police after that, and\nLuke, single-handed, trounced four of them so soundly and thoroughly\nthat someone sent in a riot call. It had taken a dozen of the reserves\nto club him into submission at the last.\n\nThat was too much for Martian justice. In pronouncing sentence the judge\nhad termed Luke an incurably vicious character and a menace to society\nsuch as the planet had never harbored. And Luke, his head swathed in\nbandages from which his wiry red hair bristled like the comb of a\ngamecock, had grinned evilly and snarled his defiance.\n\nAnd so they were taking him to the dread prison camp known as Vulcan's\nWorkshop, a mysterious place of horror and hardship from which no\nconvict had ever returned. Vaguely Luke knew that it was located on\nstill another world, away off somewhere in the heavens. He had seen the\nlips of men go white when they were condemned to its reputed torture,\nhad heard them plead for death in preference. Yet its terrors had not\nawed him; they did not awe him now. He had beaten the law before; he'd\nbeat it again--even in Vulcan's Workshop.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nA key rattled in the lock and Luke Fenton leaped to his feet, facing the\nbarred door with feet spread wide and with his massive shoulders hunched\nexpectantly. He could see now, with much blinking and watering of his\nstill aching eyes, and he looked out with sneering disapproval at the\nthree guards in the corridor. They were afraid of him, singly, these\nMartian cops, even though armed with the deadly dart guns and with\nshot-loaded billies. So afraid, Luke chuckled inwardly, that they had\nkept him from the other prisoners throughout the trip, kept him in\nsolitary confinement.\n\nThe door was opening and it came to Luke that the ethership was\nstrangely and hollowly silent. The rocket tubes were stilled, that was\nit, and even the motors that drove the great ventilating fans had been\nstopped. They had arrived.\n\nNo time now to start anything. He would have to submit tamely to\nwhatever they might mete out to him in the way of punishment--until he\ngot the lay of the land. It would require some time to study things out\nand to plan. But plan he would, and act; they'd never hold him here\nuntil he died of whatever it was that killed men quickly in Vulcan's\nWorkshop. Not Luke Fenton.\n\nSullenly docile, he was prodded forward to the air-lock. A draft of hot\nfetid air swept through the corridor, carrying with it the forewarning\nof unspeakable things to come. And a shriek of mortal terror wafted in\nfrom outside by the stinking breeze, told of some poor devil already\ndemoralized. The thick muscles of Luke's biceps tightened to hard knots\nunder his black prison jacket.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey were outside then and Luke essayed a deep breath, a breath that was\nchokingly acrid in his throat.\n\n\"Waugh!\" he coughed, and spat. One of the guards laughed.\n\nAny foul epithet that might have formed on Fenton's lips was forgotten\nin the sight that met his eyes. A barren and rugged terrain stretched\nout from the landing stage, a land utterly desolate of vegetation and\nincapable of supporting life. Pockmarked with craters and seamed with\nyawning fissures from which dense vapors curled, it was seemingly devoid\nof habitation. And the scene was visible only in the lurid half light of\nflame-shot mists that hung low over all. In the all too near distance,\nawesomely vast and ruddy columns of fire rose and fell with monotonous\nregularity. For the first time, Luke experienced something of the\nsuperstitious fear exhibited by even the most hardened criminals when\nfaced with a term at Vulcan's Workshop. That term, to them, meant horror\nand misery, torture and swift death. And he, too, was ready to believe\nit now.\n\nHe was prodded down an incline that led from the landing stage to the\nrocks below. The guards from the ethership, he saw, remained behind on\nthe platform and there were new guards awaiting him below. Husky\nfellows, these were, in strange bulky clothing and armed with the\nhighest powered dart guns. The other prisoners from the vessel were\nalready down there, a huddled and frightened mass--a squashed pile,\nalmost--silent now and watchful of their jailers.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Come on, show some speed, tough guy!\" a guard yelled from the foot of\nthe runway. \"Think this is a reception?\"\n\nAnother of the guards guffawed hoarsely, and Luke choked back the\nblasting retort that rose in his throat. Plenty of time yet before he'd\nbe ready to make things hot for those birds.\n\nThe runway, he observed, was a strip of yielding metal that glowed\nfaintly with an unnatural greenish light. He was nearing its lower end\nwhen the siren of the ethership shrieked and he heard the clang of the\nouter door of its air-lock as it swung to its seat.\n\nThen he stepped out to the smooth stone slab on which the nearest of the\nguards was standing. Immediately it was as if a tremendous weight was\nflung upon him, bearing him down until his knees buckled beneath him. He\nwas rooted to the spot by an enormous force which dragged at his vitals\nand weighted his limbs to leaden uselessness. With a mighty effort he\nraised his head to look up into the grinning yellow face of the guard,\nand his thick neck muscles were taut gnarled ridges under the strain.\n\n\"Damn your hide!\" he howled. \"It's a trick. I'll break you in two for\nthis, you slob!\"\n\nHis huge biceps tensed and his fists came up. But they came up slowly\nand ineffectually, ponderous things he could scarcely lift. A great\nroaring of rocket tubes was in his ears then, and the ethership screamed\noff through the red mists while he dabbed futilely at the leering yellow\nface. And vile curses rasped from between his set teeth at the laughter\nof the guards.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nLuke Fenton never had taken the trouble to learn or he would have known\nsomething about this planet Vulcan on which he was a prisoner. As far\nback as 1859, by Earth chronology, its existence within the orbit of\nMercury had been reported by one Lescarbault, a French physician. But\nother astronomers had failed to confirm, in fact had ridiculed his\ndiscovery, and it was not until some years after the establishing of\ninterplanetary travel in the first decade of the twenty-first century\nthat the body was definitely located.\n\nVulcan, the smallest and innermost of the planets, circles the sun with\ngreat rapidity at a mean distance of twenty million miles. Its periods\nof rotation and revolution are equal, so that it always presents the\nsame face toward the solar system's great center of heat and light--for\nwhich reason one side is terrifically hot and the other, that facing\ninto outer space, unbearably cold.\n\nThere is no life native to the body, and mankind has found it possible\nto exist only in the narrow belt immediately on the dark side of the\nterminator, the line of demarcation between night and day. Here there\nare the dense vapors, illuminated perpetually by refracted light from\nthe daylight side and by the internal fires of the planet itself, fires\nwhich erupt at regular intervals through many fissures and craters. And\nit is only under greatest hardship that man can exist even here, what\nwith the noxious gases and the extremes of heat and cold to which his\nbody it subjected. There is no natural source of water or of food, so\nthese essentials must of necessity be conveyed from Mars or Earth by\nethership.\n\nIn spite of all this, man has persisted in establishing himself in the\nvapor belt of Vulcan for the sake of wresting from the rocky soil its\nvast deposits of rare ores, and a great number of mining operations are\ncontinually in progress. All of these are commercial projects and are\nworked by adventurous seekers of fortune, save only the penal colony\nknown as Vulcan's Workshop: But no Terrestrial or Martian, however\ngreedy for riches, would dare to remain longer than two lunar months,\nwhich is the average time limit of human endurance. Only the condemned\nremain, and these remain to die.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThough hardly more than two hundred miles in diameter, Vulcan is\npossessed of a surface gravity almost six times greater than that on\nEarth. This is due to the planet's core of neutronium, the densest known\nsubstance of the universe, a little understood concentration of matter\nwhose atoms comprise only nuclei from which all negative electrons have\nbeen stripped by some stupendous cataclysm of nature.\n\nAnd so it was that Luke Fenton, uninsulated from the tremendous gravity\npull when he stepped from the charged metal of the runway, was\nstruggling against his own bodily weight, suddenly increased to more\nthan twelve hundred pounds.\n\nDoggedly, the Earthman pitted his mighty sinews against the force he\ncould not understand. Here was an intangible thing, yet it was a power\nthat challenged his own brute strength, and he exerted himself to the\nlimit in accepting the challenge. With legs spread wide and with sweat\noozing from every pore, he heaved himself erect, straightening knees and\nspine and standing there firmly on his two feet.\n\n\"He's carrying it!\" came the husky whisper of a guard. \"This bird _is_\ntough.\"\n\nCraftily, Luke bared his white, even teeth in a good-humored grin. He\nhad seen what they were doing with the other prisoners, fitting them one\nby one with the strange bulky breeches--garments that gave forth a faint\ngreenish glow like that of the runway. And each of the men, so attired,\nwas enabled somehow to get to his feet easily and walk about as if\nunhampered by the force which had flattened him to the rocks and which\nstill held Luke's straining body in its grip.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe yellow-skinned guard, a Terrestrial of Asiatic origin, was solemnly\nengaged now in lacing the slitted legs of a similar garment to Luke's\nrigid nether limbs. Yet there was no cessation of that awful weight when\nthe thing was done. The guard stepped back and leered wickedly. He had\nslung his dart gun over his shoulder and now produced a slender black\ntube which he leveled at Luke's midsection.\n\n\"You walk now, Fenton,\" he snarled.\n\nThe Earthman rose upward as if he would leave the ground. Two or three\ninches seemed added to his stature, and his muscles trembled from the\nsudden release. He stepped a pace forward.\n\nThen a light beam flashed forth from the black tube and Luke sagged down\nwith an astonished oath squeezed grunting from his throat. The swift\nrenewal of the inexplicable force had caught him off balance and he\ndropped ignominiously to his knees.\n\n\"Ha!\" gloated the Oriental. \"It is thus we control the tough ones,\nFenton. I've given you a warning; now get up--and march!\"\n\nOn the last word came blessed release and the return of Luke's strength.\nHe marched, meekly falling in with the file of new prisoners. He even\nsmiled through the red stubble of his beard. But black hatred was in his\nheart, and renewed determination that he'd get away from this place\nsomehow--alive.\n\nTime would show him the way.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nFenton's slow but retentive mind absorbed many things during the\nsucceeding few days. There was neither day nor night in this hellish\nplace--only the flame-lit mists; but they had clocks like those of\nEarth, and you worked fourteen hours on the slope or in the smelter and\nhad the rest of each so-called day of twenty-four hours in which to eat\nand sleep.\n\nThe food was coarse, but there was plenty of it. There was only water to\ndrink, lukewarm stinking stuff, doled out sparingly in rusty tin cups.\nAnd, during the sleeping periods, you were required to take off the\ngravity-insulated garments and sleep in huts with insulated floor\ncoverings. The charged floor, of course, allowed you to sleep without\nbeing smashed flat on the uncomfortable cots. But they had you safe in\nthese sleeping huts; they took away your clothes and you couldn't step\nout of the door without taking on the weight of a half a dozen men.\n\nThe Workshop itself was in a vast excavation from whose slopes a\nsilvery-veined ore was being removed. There were the blast furnace and\nreduction plant on the one side and the convicts' huts and more\npretentious houses of the guards on the other. And the choking mists,\nand the lurid flame behind. The stifling heat, Luke learned, too, that\nevery ninth day, with what they called the libration of Vulcan, there\ncame an equal period of raw and biting cold to replace the heat. As bad\nor worse, that would be.\n\nThere were perhaps three hundred prisoners here, Luke guessed, and a\nguard allotted to each squad of fifteen men. Not many guards for so\nlarge a number of convicts--but enough. The weird gravity of Vulcan had\ntaken care of that, and the flashlight things they always carried--queer\nlights that would instantly neutralize the insulating property of his\nclothing and render a man helpless.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nLuke was working high up on the slope, with rock drill and pick. The\ngroup to which he had been assigned was composed entirely of new\nprisoners, mostly white men, but with a few blacks and one\ncoppery-skinned drylander of Mars. Whimpering, hopeless creatures, all\nof them; not worth his notice. All day he labored without speaking to\nany of them and the quantities of ore he removed gave mute evidence of\nhis tireless vigor. If Kulan, the giant Martian guard, took any notice\nof it he gave no sign.\n\nDuring the sleeping period, which they persisted in calling night,\nthings were different. No guards were needed in the escape-proof huts\nand there was some surreptitious fraternizing among the prisoners. As\nlong as they made no undue noise, they were left to their own devices.\nBut for the most part they went to sleep heavily and wordlessly as soon\nas they flung into their bunks. A broken-spirited lot.\n\nLuke saw men suffering from some horrible malady that made them cough\nand scream and bleed from nose and mouth. Old-timers, these were, men\nwho had survived for as many as three of four months. He saw them, in\ntheir agony, beg the guards for merciful death; heard the brutal\nlaughter of their tormentors. Only when they were no longer able to rise\nfrom their bunks were they put out of their misery by one of the singing\ndarts from the senior guard's gun.\n\nNovak had it, this malady known as X.C.--Novak, the scar-faced,\nyellow-fanged rat who occupied the bunk beneath Luke's and who talked to\nhim in hoarse whispers long after the others had gone to sleep. It was\nfrom Novak that Luke was learning, and the knowledge he gained by\nlistening to the doomed man served only to intensify the flame of hate\nthat smoldered deep in his barrel-like chest.\n\nAfter three red-lit days of grueling labor and three similarly red-lit\nnights of listening to Novak, he reached the grudging conclusion that\nescape from this place was impossible. With this conviction there came\nto him a deeper bitterness and the resolve that he, Luke Fenton, would\nhave his revenge before he went the way of the rest.\n\nPerhaps the law had him for keeps this time--it certainly seemed so; but\nhe'd leave his mark on its representatives yet.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAt inspection preceding the next labor period, Luke began doing things.\n\nThe prisoners were lined up and the guards were parading the line,\nreassigning them to new working squads, which were shifted and\nrearranged every third day. Kulan, the big Martian, selected Luke.\n\n\"You, Fenton,\" he snapped, \"ten paces forward.\"\n\nLuke grinned but made no move.\n\nAmazed, the guard stepped closer. \"You heard me!\" he roared. \"I'm\nkeepin' you in my squad, tough guy.\"\n\nA ripple of astonished comment ran along the line and the other guards\nbellowed for silence. Kulan fingered the black tube of his neutro-beam\nand his broad face was chalky white.\n\nLuke advanced two paces, still grinning. And he looked up sneeringly\ninto the grim face that was a foot above his own.\n\n\"That's right, you big ape,\" he grated, \"you ain't man enough to fight\nthe way men fight. Gotta use dart guns, or gravity.\"\n\nIt was sheer baiting of the big Martian. Fenton was shrewd and he knew\nthe fellow's kind, quick to resent insult and prouder of their physical\nsize and prowess than of any other possession. He saw the flush that\nrose to replace the guard's pallor, saw the huge lithe body go tense.\nLaughing derisively, he completed his ten paces with leisurely aplomb.\n\nSpeechless with rage, Kulan stood rigid. Furtive boos and a few hoarse\ncheers came from somewhere in the long line of convicts, and Luke saw\nseveral men flattened to the ground by swift darting neutro-beams.\n\nAnd then the head guard came running from the small bastion. \"What the\nhell?\" he demanded of Kulan. \"Any trouble?\"\n\nKulan saluted, and his eyes were narrow slits. \"No sir,\" he returned\nstiffly, \"no trouble.\"\n\nEyeing Luke suspiciously, the senior guard grunted, then moved on along\nthe line. And the work of reallotting squads went on.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIt was exactly as Fenton had expected. This Kulan, a head over him in\nstature and broad in proportion, was sure in his mind that he could\nhandle the red-headed Earthman without resort to weapons. And the taunt\nas to his physical ability had struck home. In some way that guard would\nmaneuver matters so the encounter could come about. Besides, he would\nendeavor to keep Luke in his squad where he would be able to drive him\nto the utmost. The guards, Novak had said, were on the job only a month\nwhen they were replaced by fresh recruits--and their pay was based on\nthe productivity of the squads they commanded. Kulan had seen that the\nEarthman was a real sapper; worth three of the others. And he'd try to\nkeep it so.\n\nThat working period was a highly gratifying one to Luke. With the\nrankling hatred concentrated and directed at Kulan, he was positively\ngleeful. And yet he was content to bide his time. He swung his pick and\nwielded his rock drill with joyful abandon, so that three men were kept\nbusy loading the ore he removed.\n\nKulan, he saw with satisfaction, was sullen and watchful. But no word\npassed between the two. And the Earthman knew he had planted a seed that\nwas bound to sprout and grow until it bore fruit.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAt the midday mess it happened. The shifting of men had brought Novak in\nthe same squad with Luke and they came in to sit at the long table\ntogether. Kulan eyed them narrowly from the head of the board.\n\n\"Say,\" Novak whispered, \"yuh got under Kuley's skin, know it? He'll run\nyuh ragged.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Luke looked up at the guard, saw he was scowling darkly in their\ndirection, and grinned evilly. \"I'll run him, you mean. I'll bust him in\ntwo if I get my hands on him.\"\n\n\"Yuh ain't got a chance, I tell yuh. I seen a guy once, take a poke at a\nguard, and what they done to him was plenty. They----\"\n\nWith that, the wasted body of Novak bent double and he dropped to the\nground screaming. Blood gushed from his nostrils. Luke had seen the same\nthing happen to several others and he knew what to expect. It was all\nover for Novak, or nearly over.\n\nKulan came running and turned the stricken man face up.\n\n\"You'll last another period,\" he snarled. \"Get up and eat.\"\n\nHe yanked Novak to his feet and shook him as he would a sack of meal.\nThe sick man moaned and begged, his head rolling from side to side and\nhis eyes filmed with pain.\n\n\"Let me have it,\" he whimpered. \"I'm done, I tell yuh Kuley. Get\nGannett, if yuh don't believe me.\"\n\nKulan slapped him heavily with the flat of his massive hand. \"You'll\nwork another period, sewer rat, if I have to prop you up!\"\n\nThen Luke Fenton took a chance. He didn't care particularly for Novak,\nnor was he overly concerned by what might happen to him. But this gave\nhim an excuse, an opening.\n\nHe hooked his thick fingers in the collar of Kulan's jacket and twisted\nuntil the big Martian loosed Novak and whirled around. Then Luke drove a\nhard fist to his jaw--a pulled punch so as not to betray his real\nstrength. Nevertheless it set the guard back on his heels and split the\ntaut skin where it landed.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nPandemonium broke loose in the mess hall. Gannett, the senior guard,\ncame bellowing down the aisle, and the squad guards were on their feet\nin an instant, neutro-tubes and dart guns ready. The uproar of the\nprisoners died down.\n\nKulan shook his shaggy head and crouched low as he circled the Earthman.\nMurder was in his heart, and the urge to break this tough guy Fenton\nwith his bare hands. But Gannett was between them.\n\n\"Hell's bells!\" he yelped. \"What goes on here?\"\n\nThen he saw Novak--and heard him. Novak was writhing on the ground,\nbegging for death. And the chief guard's dart gun twanged as its\nneedlelike missile sped forth and drove into the sick man's breast where\nit sang its shrill song of vibratory dissolution.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye where Novak had lain was only the dust of\ncomplete disintegration and a few scintillating, dancing light flecks\nthat swiftly snuffed out. A speedy and merciful end.\n\nIn the silence that followed, Gannett turned on Kulan. \"Why didn't you\nsend for me?\" he demanded.\n\nThe guard, white with rage, indicated Luke.\n\n\"So--the tough guy Fenton again. Can't you handle him?\"\n\nKulan's yellow eyes flashed fire. \"Sure I can; I will. But I want your\npermission, sir. With my hands.\"\n\n\"No,\"--flatly. And then Gannett whirled to look over the mess tables,\nwhence a few scattered hisses had arisen.\n\nHis gaze was solemn when he returned it to Kulan. Swiftly his black eyes\nmeasured the Martian's giant body, and then they swung to Luke. The\ncomparison evidently pleased him, for he changed his mind.\n\n\"On second thought, yes,\" he said to Kulan. \"It'll be good for\ndiscipline. Only don't disable him; he's too valuable a worker.\"\n\nLuke concealed his unholy glee; stood glowering savagely. \"In fair\nfight?\" he put in.\n\n\"In fair fight,\" sneered Gannett. He took personal charge of Kulan's\nweapons. \"All right, you,\" he yelled then to the mess, \"you can watch\nthis. But if there's a sound or a move from any one of you there'll be\nthe neutro-broadcast and full gravity for an hour for the whole\nflea-bitten gang of you.\"\n\nHe drew back, motioning Luke and Kulan to an open space nearby. There\nwas not the slightest doubt in his mind as to the outcome, for the\nMartian towered over his stocky opponent and was fully fifty pounds\nheavier. This irregular procedure would put a stop to some of the open\nhomage paid to this reputed tough guy by the prisoners, and to the\nrestlessness among them which his coming had occasioned.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey fought instantly and with silent deadliness of purpose, these two.\nLuke drove in two terrible blows to the big Martian's body in the\nsplit-second before they closed, breathtaking punches that rocked Kulan\nyet did not slow him up in the least. And then the tangle of arms and\nlegs and bodies of the two was so swift moving and violent that the\nwatchers could not follow them.\n\nNow they were up, slugging, clinching; now down, rolling over and over,\nstraining and tearing at each other like beasts of the jungle. Once,\nbreaking free, Luke was seen to batter Kulan's face to a bloody mass\nwith swift, hammering fists that thudded too rapidly to count. And then\nthe Martian had flung him to the rocky ground so heavily that it seemed\ncertain the Earthman's end had come. But such was not the case, for\nthere was a flailing scramble and Luke Fenton rose up with the great\nbody of Kulan across his shoulders. He spread his legs wide and heaved\nmightily.\n\nThe Martian guard kicked and squirmed, lashing out with his huge fists\nat the squarely-built and squarely-planted body of the Earthman below\nhim. But to no avail. Grasping a shoulder and a thigh, Fenton\nstraightened his thick arms and Kulan was hoisted aloft. Amazingly then,\nthe madly struggling guard was flung out and away to land with a\nsickening thud, smashed and crumpled on the rocks.\n\nLuke stood swaying on those spreadeagled legs and his lungs were near\nbursting from the exertion in the noxious atmosphere. \"There you are,\nGannett,\" he howled through swollen lips. \"That fair enough for you?\"\n\nIn the ominous silence a cracked voice yelped: \"Attaboy Fenton!\"\n\nWild disorder followed. Immediately there was the raucous call of the\ngeneral alarm siren and a flashing light from the bastion that paled the\nred mists to a sickly, luminous pink. Full gravity coming down with\ncrushing force on the hapless prisoners.\n\nLuke, as he was flattened, gasping painfully under the enormous\npressure, saw that Gannett and the rest of the guards were not affected\nby the neutro-broadcast. They stood erect and moved freely among the\nprisoners who sprawled everywhere in grotesque squashed heaps. Queer.\nThere was no way of beating the authorities at this game.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nGannett transferred Luke to the dreaded sealed cell in the reduction\nplant, a room spoken of in hushed whispers by the convicts, and in which\nit was reported an inmate suffered indescribable tortures for the better\npart of three weeks. Then he died in horrible misery, for one could not\nsurvive longer than that.\n\nKulan had not been killed. He would recover, but was pretty well smashed\nup, with a fractured hip and several broken ribs, one of which had\npunctured a lung. It would be necessary to return him to Mars on the\nnext ethership, due in two days. Strangely, the news brought Luke no\ngreat amount of satisfaction.\n\nWhen they locked him up in the sealed cell for his first period of labor\nhe saw there was only one other occupant. A tall lanky Earthman with\nnarrow aristocratic features and keen gray eyes. He was perhaps\nforty-five, slightly stooped, and with thin graying hair. Luke had seen\nhim several times at mess and had contemptuously classed him as a\nhighbrow. Fuller, his name was.\n\nThis was a small room where several slender chutes brought down tumbling\ncrystals of a silvery salt from somewhere above, emptying it into glass\ncontainers that stood in endless rows in wooden racks. You filled these\ncontainers with the salt, then sealed them in lead tubes and packed them\nfor shipment. There was a faint pungent odor in the air of the room, a\nnew smell that widened Luke's nostrils and caught at his throat and\nlungs.\n\nIn this place you were watched by a guard who came regularly each half\nhour and spied on you through a peephole.\n\nChild's play, the work in the sealed cell. Luke went at it\nhalf-heartedly and he spoke no word to Fuller after the heavy door had\nclosed them in. After ten minutes of silence he caught himself watching\nhis companion furtively.\n\nWhat was there about Fuller that marked him as superior to Luke and the\nrest of the convicts? A good gust of wind would blow the man away; a\nwoman might easily beat him in a rough and tumble. Yet this man had\nsomething which unmistakably proclaimed greatness, the same something\nthat gave authority and power to the smart guys of Earth and Mars.\nBrains--book-learning! Luke snorted.\n\nFuller was looking at him with calmly appraising gaze. Luke scowled\ndarkly, but the keen eyes that measured him did not waver.\n\n\"You're a fool, Fenton,\" came from the thin lips.\n\n\"What!\" Luke advanced threateningly.\n\n\"I repeat: you are a fool.\" Still the gray eyes were unwavering.\n\n\"Why, you--you----\" Spasmodically Luke's fingers closed down on the\nspare shoulder with crushing force.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nBy not so much as the flicker of an eyelash did Fuller betray the pain\nthat must have come with that grip. He did not even wince, but swiftly\nlashed out with a bony fist, raking Luke's cheek with sharp knuckles.\nThe blow stung, but was utterly futile. With a single cuff Luke could\nsend the man sprawling; with a single wrench of his powerful hands, snap\nhis spine. Yet he did neither, and the impulse to laugh coarsely died in\nhis throat. Here was courage of a kind he never had encountered; here a\nman in whose bright eyes fearlessness and defiance mingled with a cool\ndisdain that brought the first real feeling of inferiority Luke ever had\nexperienced.\n\nHe relaxed his grip of Fuller's shoulder and his big hands fell loosely\nat his sides. It was that action which saved Fenton. He did not know it\nat the time, nor would he have believed it. But he was to remember many\ntimes and finally to realize it, though he never fully understood.\n\n\"That's better,\" breathed Fuller. And the ghost of a smile crinkled the\ncorner of his mouth.\n\nAt the old man's warning Luke returned to his own work bench and was\nindustriously engaged when the guard's eye showed at the peephole. Then\nthe eye was gone and he grinned over at Fuller.\n\n\"How long you been in here?\" he ventured.\n\n\"Five days in the sealed cell; ten altogether in the Workshop.\"\n\nLuke pondered this. \"How'd you get in the cell?\"\n\n\"Same way you did--I struck a guard.\"\n\n\"No!\" marveled Luke. \"Mean to tell me you----\"\n\n\"I had a reason to get in here,\" Fuller broke in mildly.\n\n\"You--you _wanted_ to get in?\" Luke was incredulous.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"My God, you ain't crazy, are you--wantin' to get yourself killed off\nquicker?\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"No, that isn't it,\" Fuller explained patiently. \"I've a plan to escape\nand only by taking the chance of spending some time here could I obtain\naccess to the necessary materials. Fenton, I'm a scientist and I\nknow----\"\n\n\"Escape!\" Luke snorted. \"You _are_ crazy. Where you goin' to go?\"\n\n\"Listen, Fenton.\" The other dropped his voice. \"I'm not doing this\nblindly; I have friends outside. And you can help me. You can get away\nyourself, alive. I called you a fool and by that I meant that you have\nrelied too much on brute force in your lifetime and had not sense enough\nto realize that this brought only trouble. Combine your brawn with my\nbrains, now, and do as I say--if you will I promise you freedom. Will\nyou do it, or do you want to keep on being a fool?\"\n\nLuke bristled, but the earnestness of that steady gaze served to check\nhis rising temper. \"I still think you're nuts,\" he growled, \"but hell, I\nain't fool enough to pass up any kind of chance of gettin' outa here.\nGimme the dope.\"\n\nFuller coughed slightly and a fleck of red-tinged foam appeared at his\nlips. \"It'll have to be to-day,\" he whispered. \"One more day in this\nplace and it'll be too late for me.\"\n\nX.C.! Luke stared, horrified. Fuller had it already and didn't know it.\nPoor devil; he was a goner before he started this crazy break of his.\nStrangely, Luke was deeply concerned. It was a new experience, this\nfeeling of compassion for a fellow man.\n\n\"To-day!\" he grunted. \"You ain't figurin' on gettin' out to-day?\"\n\n\"Positively--it must be to-day. I'll explain.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nMuch of what followed was unintelligible to Luke Fenton, but he absorbed\nenough of the scientist's explanation to understand that his plan was\nnot impossible of realization. He waxed enthusiastic.\n\nTom Fuller was vague concerning his own past, but Luke gathered that a\npolitical crime had been responsible for his sentence to the Workshop.\nThere was much bitterness in the scientist's refusal to dwell on this\npoint. This, too, Luke was able to understand. The bond between them\nstrengthened.\n\n\"It's like this,\" Fuller told him: \"these suits which enable us to move\nabout comfortably in Vulcan's gravity are really quite simple in their\nfunctioning. A maze of fine wires is woven into the fabric, and these\nwires are charged with anti-gravity energies from tiny capsules which\nare inserted under the belt of the garment. The capsules are really\nminiature atomic generators and are replaced with fresh ones each night\nduring the sleeping period, since the initial charge lasts only eighteen\nhours. The generated energies neutralize more than eighty percent of the\neffect of gravity and our weight thus becomes approximately the same as\nit is on Earth. Such garments are worn by all prospectors and other\nvisitors to Vulcan.\"\n\n\"How come the neutro-beams?\" asked Luke.\n\nThey are used only here in the Workshop and they operate the same as the\nneutro-broadcast from the bastion, the only difference being that the\nbroadcast blankets an area of about two miles in all directions. In both\ncases vibratory ether waves are sent out and these are of such frequency\nand wave form as to neutralize the anti-gravity energies originating in\nour capsules. They render our suits useless, but those of the guards are\nprovided with insulating coverings which block off the waves and thus\npermit their own garments to function even when the neutro-broadcast is\nin operation.\"\n\n\"Smart guys,\" commented Luke. \"Too smart. How the devil we gonna get\naway, then? They'll send out the alarm and----\"\n\n\"Ah, that is where we fool them, Fenton. With the radium.\"\n\n\"Radium!\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Yes, didn't you know? This ore we mine here contains a higher\npercentage of that valuable element than any on Earth or Mars. Its\nemanations, together with certain atmospheric gases of Vulcan, are what\ncause X.C.--a swift destruction of tissue in the lungs and other vital\norgans. And this concentrate\"--Fuller waved his hand toward the rows of\ntubes before him--\"is most highly radioactive of all the products of the\nWorkshop. That is why the sealed cell is so very dangerous to work in.\nBut it is this radioactive salt that gives us the means for escape----\"\n\nBoth men turned quickly to their labors on hearing the footsteps of the\nguard.\n\n\"My suit is already prepared,\" continued Fuller, when the eye had gone\nfrom the peephole. \"Now to prepare yours. I discovered that this\nradioactivity can be used to defeat the purpose of the neutro-rays as\nwell or better than the regular insulation, which, of course, we can not\nobtain. That is why I wanted to be in the sealed cell for a time. We\nmerely pack a quantity of the radioactive salt around the capsules in\nthe lining of our garments, and the radium emanations continue the\nexcitation of the tiny atomic generators even under the influence of the\nneutralizing vibrations. Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLuke did comprehend, even though the technical explanation was beyond\nhis understanding. They would be able to defy this terrible gravity of\nVulcan. They could fight unhampered; walk, or run--to meet these\nmysterious friends of Fuller's. The flashlights and the broadcast would\nbe useless against them.\n\nThe lanky scientist outlined the further details of his plan in swift\nwhispers while he worked with the energizing capsule of Luke's garment.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nActual escape was surprisingly easy. They waited until the labor period\nwas finished, when Chan Dai, the yellow-skinned guard, came to unlock\nthe door. As agreed, Tom Fuller came out first and Luke held back,\ndragging his feet and cursing softly to himself.\n\n\"What'd you say?\" the guard snarled.\n\nLuke grinned disarmingly. \"Nothin',\" he drawled. Still he hung back,\nscarcely moving from where he stood just within the door.\n\n\"Come on, tough guy, a little speed.\" Chan Dai reached for him.\n\nAnd then Luke was upon him. The neutro-beam flashed harmlessly. Luke's\nbig hands moved with lightning swiftness, his left one scooping the\nguard's dart gun from its shoulder strap and his right closing on the\nastonished Oriental's wind-pipe. It was the work of only an instant to\nchoke him in unconsciousness and lock him in the sealed cell.\n\n\"Quick, the chute!\" hissed Fuller. He dived head foremost into a\nrectangular wooden trough that was used for the disposal of the gangue\nfrom a crushing mill above. This chute, Fuller had said, led to the\noutside at the back of the reduction plant.\n\nAcross the passage Luke saw a squad of convicts and two guards emerging\nfrom the lift. Then he plunged down the steeply inclined trough after\nFuller. As he slid and tumbled into the darkness, he heard the hoarse\nshouting of the guards.\n\nHe landed heavily in the pile of gangue at the base of the chute; then\nwas scrambling and slipping down with an avalanche of the sharp edged\nstone. At the bottom, he saw that Fuller had already started up the\nslope of the great pit which enclosed the Workshop. Luke darted after\nhim.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey were hidden from the bastion by the buildings of the smelter and\nreduction plant. But the loud yelling of guards back there in the pit\ngave evidence that word of the escape was being passed along to Gannett.\nBefore they were halfway up the slope there was the shriek of the alarm\nsiren, and Luke felt his body sag with a sudden increase of weight. Fool\nthat he had been to trust the scrawny scientist!\n\n\"It's the broadcast,\" panted Fuller, beside him. There is some effect,\nof course. You're probably carrying fifty extra pounds.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" Luke hoped it would be no worse.\n\nFuller slipped into a narrow crevasse that ran slantwise of the slope\nand extended upward to the rim of the pit. The going was much easier\nhere and they made rapid progress toward the top. Suddenly Luke realized\nthat it was growing very cold; there was a bite to the foul air, and\nmoisture from the red mist was frosting his beard. The liberation of the\ntiny planet and consequent shifting of the terminator was bringing\nfrigidity to Vulcan's Workshop.\n\nThey came up out of the crevasse at the top of the pit and Luke could\nnot resist looking back. Every convict in sight was flattened to the\nground. They sprawled singly and in heaps, each one a squashed inert\nthing that would not move again until the neutro-broadcast was\ndiscontinued. The guards, confident they would find the escaped\nprisoners in like condition, were searching the slope below them.\n\nLuke raised Chan Dai's, dart gun to his shoulder.\n\nFuller struck aside the muzzle of the weapon. \"No!\" he protested, \"No\nunnecessary killing, Fenton. They're completely fooled, and we'll be\nwell on our way before they know the truth.\"\n\nGrumbling, Luke drew back from the rim of the excavation.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nUp here the ground was fairly level, but there were many fissures and\nsmall craters which made the footing precarious. The mists were so dense\nthey could see scarcely two hundred feet ahead.\n\n\"We'll be lost in the vapors when they finally wake up and come out\nafter us,\" Fuller said. \"And look Fenton, off there to the left are the\nthree columns of fire that mark the rendezvous.\"\n\nThey plunged on through the red mist toward the flaming pillars. Those\nbeacons, even though they subsided at regular intervals, quickly\nreappeared after each cessation. And their brilliance penetrated the\nmists with ease at this distance of about two miles. There was no fear\nof missing their destination.\n\n\"Sure your friends'll be there?\" Luke asked doubtingly. He was beginning\nto have some misgivings about the matter--the scientist had been\nanything but explicit as to who these friends were. And the longer his\nthoughts dwelt upon the things Fuller had told him the more suspicious\nhe became. Pretty cagey about everything but the actual getting away\nfrom the Workshop, Fuller had been.\n\n\"Certainly they will; they've been waiting two days.\" Fuller's tone was\nimpatient and his words came painfully. \"You leave that part of it to\nme, Fenton,\" he gasped. There was a fleck of blood at his lips.\n\nAs the scientist stumbled on through the mists, Luke's doubts increased\nand he began to lose his respect for the man's intellect and for the\ncunning which had enabled him to outwit the neutralizing energies used\nby the guards. After all, he was a weak and puny specimen. They all\nwere, the smart guys who held the people of two worlds in their power by\nexercising the knowledge they had learned from books. And this one had\nfailed even in that; whatever he might have been, he had run afoul of\nthe law himself and was already a doomed man. Tricks! This trick of\nFuller's had gotten them away, but of what use was it without the brute\nforce necessary to carry on to a successful end?\n\nThe brawn Tom had spoken of so slightingly was what they needed from\nthis time on, and nothing else would save them. Luke had that brawn;\nFuller did not. The scientist slipped and nearly lost his balance at the\nedge of a fissure, but Luke made no move to help him. It was every man\nfor himself at this stage of the game.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIncreasing difficulty came with every step. Now they were sliding and\nrolling into a deep crater, now scrambling up its steep sides with hands\ntorn and bodies bruised by the jagged boulders. A yawning crevasse\nopened before them and they were forced to skirt its edge for fully a\nhalf mile in the wrong direction before they found a crossing. And the\ncold was unbelievably intense. Numbed and silent, with their eyes half\nblinded and lungs seared by the frosty air, they struggled on toward the\nthree pillars of flame.\n\nAnd still Tom Fuller carried on, though Luke was now in the lead.\n\nThey had covered probably half the distance to the flaming columns when\nshouts arose behind them. The guards were on their trail.\n\n\"Can't--find us,\" Fuller panted. \"The mists----\"\n\n\"Hell, the mists are clearing,\" Luke snarled. \"You ain't so damn smart\nas you think.\"\n\nWhat he said was true. Though there was less light on account of the new\nangle with the sun farther below the horizon, the red mist was\ndefinitely lighter in color, noticeably less dense. Visibility was good\nto several hundred yards. Luke turned his head, but could see nothing of\ntheir pursuers.\n\n\"They can't,\" Fuller insisted weakly.\n\nLuke, pushed on with renewed vigor, ignoring him, cursing.\n\nAnd then there came faintly to his ears the twang of a dart gun; the\nshrill scream of its deadly vibrating missile; a violent blow that flung\nhim headlong.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nLike a cat, he bounced to his feet, crouching with Chan Dai's dart gun\nat his shoulder. A strangely grotesque heap was at his feet--Tom Fuller.\nOff there in the thinning mist he saw a shadowy figure and he fired at\nit twice. Whether his darts found their mark he was never to know, for a\nwall of white swept down suddenly to obscure his vision. Snow! Great\nmassed flakes falling endlessly--the moisture of the mist crystallized\nand closing in on him to hide him even more safely, than had the mists\nthemselves.\n\nHe was on his knees then at Fuller's side. A brilliant flash and a\nscreaming roar over amongst the rocks apprised him of the fact that the\nguard's dart had gone wide. And yet Fuller was down, moaning with pain.\nLuke tried to turn him over and found that his body had taken on\ntremendous weight. He was flattened, crushed to the rocky surface of\nVulcan by the full force of its gravity!\n\n\"What the devil!\" he grunted as he heaved and strained. \"What'd they do\nto you, old man?\"\n\nWith great effort he succeeded in turning the scientist face up. Then he\nsaw what had happened, and knew in a flash that Fuller had saved him\nfrom the singing dart whose energy was making a sizzling puddle of the\nstones where it had landed. The missile, in passing, had carried away\nthe belt and part of the fabric of Tom's garment--carried away the\ncapsule and the radium that energized it. Made the thing worse than\nuseless. And Fuller had done this for him; he had flung himself upon\nLuke to shove him out of the line of fire ... risking his own life\ngladly ... lucky the deadly dart had missed his body, but....\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"You go on, Fenton,\" the scientist was whispering through lips that were\nblue and stiff. \"Leave me here. I'm licked. But you can carry on the\nwork; go to my friends and tell them--everything. Tell them what you saw\nback there--tell them----\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Luke's words were softly growled. There was a new and utterly\nunaccountable huskiness in his voice as he straddled the prone body and\nlocked his strong fingers underneath. \"You ain't gonna be left behind,\"\nhe grunted. \"We're goin' on, brother, together.\"\n\nHis back straightened and Fuller was swung clear of the ground. His huge\nbiceps tensed and the scrawny scientist was in the air, up and above the\nbowed head, then let down gently to rest across the broad shoulders of\nLuke Fenton. Fuller hung there, bent double by the immense weight of\nhim, crushed to painful contact with the taut muscles that carried the\nstrain.\n\nOn Earth, Fuller might have tipped the scales at a scant one hundred and\nthirty pounds; now his sagging body was a load in excess of seven\nhundredweight. With that load upon him, and glorying in the effort it\ncost, Luke staggered on toward the triple red glow, which, even in the\nblinding whiteness of the snowfall, marked the location of the columns\nof fire.\n\nThat all feeling had left his limbs in the deep-biting cold meant\nnothing; that his lungs were near bursting under the terrific strain\nmeant even less. Luke Fenton had found a man. One he would fight for,\nnot against. And, miraculously, he had found himself.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAfter that there was a blur of interminable torture. Reeling and\nstumbling, his leg and back muscles shot through with stabbing pain as\nthe frost worked slowly upward, Luke plodded doggedly ahead. An\noccasional shout came from far behind where the guards still searched\nthe rocky plateau.\n\nAcross his great shoulders, Luke's burden was a dead weight, of\ncorpselike rigidity and stillness. Yet Luke clung to it tenaciously,\ndisposing the drooping leaden limbs as comfortably as possible by the\njudicious spreading of his own brawny arms.\n\nFuller, he was sure, had not long to live in any event. X.C. had\nalready progressed to such a point that it was hardly possible he could\nrecover. And yet, these smart guys Luke always had detested--the doctors\nand surgeons and such--they might be able to do something for the poor\ndevil. Anyway, he determined, he'd get the scientist to his friends dead\nor alive, and he'd see to it that they treated him right. If they\ndidn't....\n\nThe red glow was suddenly very bright and a silvery metallic shape\nloomed up before him in the whiteness. An ethership! Luke tried to call\nout but his bellowing voice was gone; only faint gurgling sounds came\nfrom his throat. He pushed forward with a savage summoning of his last\nounce of energy and Fuller's weight was that of a mastodon upon him. The\ncurved hull of the vessel was overhead when he slipped and fell to one\nknee in the thick carpet of snow.\n\nLuke saw them then, a dozen strangers running from the open air-lock of\nthe ship. In uniform, some of them--government officials of Earth and\nMars. Damn them, it was a trap!\n\nKnowing vaguely that they had surrounded him, he let Fuller slip from\nhis shoulders and lowered him gently to the snow. Lurching to his feet,\nhe stood swaying above the scientist's body, ready to defend the\nhelpless man against any who came to take him. Defiant curses died in\nhis paralyzed throat as darkness swooped down to blot out all\nconsciousness. His steel-sinewed body, beaten at last, slumped\nprotectingly over the lanky form of his new-found friend.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nWhen Luke next saw the light he stared long and hard at immaculate white\nwalls and ceiling that shut him in. A gentle purring was in his ears and\nhe knew he was in an ethership that was under way. He lay weak and\nhelpless beneath snowy covers, on an iron hospital bed.\n\nThere were voices in the room, hushed, awed voices, and Luke moved his\nhead painfully to stare across the room. Fuller, he saw, was stretched\non another cot, pale and still. And a white-clad nurse was there,\nbending over him, talking softly to a doctor. The words that passed\nbetween them brought enlightenment to Luke--and more. They brought a new\nelation, and understanding, and hope.\n\nWhen the doctor and nurse had left, Luke lay for a long time with his\nthoughts. There was a man--Tom Fuller. Unafraid, as an agent of a\nspecial governmental committee investigating prison conditions he had\nvolunteered to get the evidence on Vulcan's Workshop. And he had done\nit, even though it was almost certain that his own life was to be the\nprice. He had dared the misery and hardship, dared X.C. and the\nhorrible death it brought, that this hellhole of Vulcan might be\nexposed, that it might be wiped out of existence by government\nagreement. Vulcan's Workshop, where the gold dust of a certain political\nclique, brought torture and disease and extinction to hapless prisoners\nwho might otherwise be remade into useful members of society by the use\nof scientific methods--all this was to be no more.\n\nFuller had succeeded where many others had failed. And Fuller was not to\ndie. Only one of his lungs had been affected by X.C. and this not too\nextensively to respond to treatment. Many months of careful attendance\nwould be required, and many more months of convalescence. But Fuller,\nthey were sure, would live, Luke gloated.\n\nFrom what he had heard, Luke gathered that there was to be no trouble\nabout his own pardon. Oddly enough, this gave him no satisfaction.\nSomething had happened to him--inside. For the first time he realised\nhis debt to society and would have preferred that just sentence be\ncarried out upon him. But not in that place, not in Vulcan's Workshop!\nLuke shuddered.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAnd lying there, he swore a mighty oath that the remainder of his life\nwas to be devoted to entirely different pursuits. It was not too late to\nface about, not too late to learn. If Fuller would help him, he _would_\nlearn. He had acquired a healthy respect for the book-learning he\nformerly ridiculed, and he wanted some of it for himself--as much as he\ncould get. His old creed was forgotten, and his bitterness vanished.\n\n\"Luke!\" At the scientist's husky whisper he turned his head. Fuller was\ngazing at him with wide, solemn eyes.\n\n\"Thanks, Luke,\" the thin lips murmured.\n\n\"Thanks yourself. Where'd we be right now if it wasn't for your radium?\"\n\nThere was silence as they regarded one another.\n\n\"I need you, Luke,\" Fuller whispered then, \"in my laboratory back home.\nI'll be laid up for a long time, you know, and there's much to be done.\nYour brawn and my brain--we'll both profit. What do you say to that,\nFenton, will you do it?\"\n\nLuke grinned. \"Will I? Just watch me!\"\n\nThen, with a queer lump choking him, Luke looked away. He could think of\nno words to suit the occasion; he couldn't think at all somehow.\n\nBlissfully, he fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Vulcan's Workshop, by Harl Vincent\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VULCAN'S WORKSHOP ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29321.txt or 29321.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/3/2/29321/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
