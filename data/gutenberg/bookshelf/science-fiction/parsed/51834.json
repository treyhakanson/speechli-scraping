In that day and\nage, unmarried people did not have children; science, the law, and\npublic sophistication had combined to make the historical \"accident\"\nalmost impossible. Yet, if some woman of one of the more innocent\nplanets had deliberately conceived in order to trap Shortmire, surely\nhe would have learned of his son's existence long before.\n\n\"I'm glad it turns out that I have an heir,\" Shortmire went on.\n\"Otherwise, the government might get its fists on what little I\nhave--and it's taken enough from me.\"\n\nAlthough the old man's estate was a considerable one, it did seem\nmeager in terms of the money he must have made. What _had_ become of\nthe golden tide that had poured in upon the golden youth, Hubbard\nwondered. Could anyone have squandered such prodigious sums upon the\nusual mundane dissipations? For, by the time the esoteric pleasures of\nthe other planets had reached Earth--the byproduct of Shortmire's own\nachievement--he must have already been too old to enjoy them.\n\nAt Hubbard's continued silence, Shortmire said defensively, \"If they'd\nlet me sell my patents to private industry, as Dyall was able to do,\nI'd be leaving a _real_ fortune!\" His voice grew thick with anger.\n\"When I think how much money Dyall made from those factory machines of\nhis....\"\n\nBut when you added the priceless extra fifty years of life to the money\nShortmire had made, it seemed to Hubbard that Shortmire had been amply\nrewarded. Although, of course, he had heard that Nicholas Dyall had\nbeen given the same reward. No point telling Shortmire, if he did not\nknow already. Hubbard could never understand why Shortmire hated Dyall\nso; it could not be merely the money--and as for reputation, he had a\nshade the advantage.\n\n\"That _toymaker_!\" Shortmire spat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHubbard tactfully changed the subject. \"What's your boy like, Jan?\" But\nof course Jan Shortmire's son could hardly be a boy; in fact, he was\nprobably almost as old as Hubbard was.\n\nSuch old age as Shortmire's was almost incredible. Sitting there in\nthe antique splendor of Hubbard's office, he looked like a splendid\nantique himself. Who could imagine that passion had ever convulsed that\nthin white face, that those frail white fingers had ever curved in\nlove and in hate? Age beyond the reach of most men had blanched this\nonce-passionate man to a chill, ivory shadow.\n\nFor once, Hubbard felt glad--almost--that he himself was ineligible for\nthe longevity treatment. The allotted five score and ten was enough for\nany except the very selfish--or selfless--man.\n\nBut Shortmire was answering his question. \"I have no idea what the boy\nis like; I've never seen him.\" Then he added, \"I suppose you've been\nwondering why I finally decided to make a will?\"\n\n\"A lawyer never wonders when people _do_ make wills, Jan,\" Hubbard said\nmildly. \"He wonders when they _don't_.\"\n\n\"I'm going on a trip to Morethis. Only one of the colonized planets\nI've never visited.\" Shortmire's smile did not reach his amber-hard\neyes. \"Civilized planets, I should have said. It isn't official\ngovernment policy to colonize planets that have intelligent native\nlive-forms.\"\n\nNot even the most besotted idealist could ever have described Jan\nShortmire as altruistic. And for him to be concerned about Morethis, of\nall planets--Morethis, where the indigenous life-forms were such as to\njustify a ruthless colonization policy ... it was outrageous! True, the\nterrestrial government had been more generous toward the Morethans than\ntoward any of the seven other intelligent life-forms they had found.\nBut this tolerance was based wholly on fear--fear of these remnants\nof an old, old civilization, eking out their existence around a dying\nstar, yet with terrible glories to remember in their twilight--and\ntraces of these glories to protect them.\n\nHow was it that Shortmire, who had been everywhere, seen everything,\nhad never been to Morethis? Hubbard looked keenly at his client. \"What\n_is_ all this, Jan?\"\n\nThe old man shrugged. \"Merely that the Foreign Office has suggested it\nwould be wise for travelers to make a will before going there. Being a\ndutiful citizen of Earth, I comply.\" He smiled balefully.\n\n\"The Foreign Office has suggested that it would be wiser not to go at\nall,\" Hubbard said. \"There are people who say Morethis ought to be\nfumigated completely.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it has rare and precious metals on which our industries\ndepend. There are herbs which have multiplied the miracles of modern\nmedicine, jewels and furs unmatched anywhere. We need the native miners\nand farmers and trappers to get these things for us.\"\n\n\"We could get them for ourselves. We do on the other planets.\"\n\nShortmire grinned. \"On Morethis, somehow, our people can't seem to\nfind these things themselves. Or, if they do, we can't find our people\nafterward. Which is why there is peace and friendship between Morethis\nand Earth.\"\n\n\"_Friendship!_ Everyone knows the Morethans hate terrestrials. They\ntolerate us only because we're stronger!\"\n\n\"Stronger physically.\" Shortmire's smile was fading. \"Even technology\nis a kind of physical strength.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNew apprehension took shape in Hubbard. \"You're not going metaphysical\nin your old age, are you, Jan? And even if you are,\" he said quickly,\nwhile he was still innocent of knowledge, hence could not be\nconsciously offending the other man's beliefs, \"what a cult to choose!\nBlood, terror and torture!\"\n\nShortmire grinned again. \"You've been watching vidicasts, Peter.\nThey've laid it on so thick, I'll probably find Morethis deadly dull\nrather than just ... deadly.\"\n\nCertainly, all Hubbard knew of Morethis was based on hearsay evidence,\nbut this was not a court of law. \"Jan you're a fool! A third of the\nterrestrials who go to Morethis never come back, and mostly they're\nyoung men, strong men.\"\n\n\"Then they're the fools.\" Shortmire's voice was low and tired. \"Because\nthey're risking a whole lifetime, whereas all I'll be risking is a few\nyears of a very boring existence.\"\n\nHubbard said no more. Even though the law still did not condone it, a\nman had the right to dispose of his own life as he saw fit.\n\nShortmire stood up. Barely stooped by age, he looked, with his great\nheight and extreme emaciation, almost like a fasting saint--a ludicrous\nsimile. \"My wine palate is gone, Peter,\" he said, clapping the\nyounger old man's shoulder, \"women and I seem to have lost our mutual\nattraction, and I never did have much of a singing voice. At least this\nis one experience I'm not too old to savor.\"\n\n\"Death, do you mean?\" Hubbard asked bluntly. \"Or Morethis?\"\n\nShortmire smiled. \"Perhaps both.\"\n\nSo Peter Hubbard was not surprised when, a few months later, he got\nword that Jan Shortmire had died on Morethis. The surprising thing was\nthe extraordinarily prosaic manner of his death: he had simply fallen\ninto a river and drowned. No traveler on Morethis had been known to\ndie by undisputed accident before; as a result, the vidicasts devoted\nmore attention to the event than they might have otherwise. But the\nnews died down, as other news took its place. In so large a universe,\nsomething was always happening; the dog days were forever gone from\njournalism.\n\nGoing through the old man's papers in his capacity as executor, Hubbard\ncame across an old passport. He was startled to discover that this trip\nhad not been Shortmire's first to Morethis. Why had he lied about it?\nBut that was a question that no one alive could answer--or so Hubbard\nthought.\n\nAlmost two years went by before the will was finally probated on all\nthe planets where Shortmire had owned property. Then the search for\nEmrys Shortmire began. Messages were dispatched to all the civilized\nplanets, and Peter Hubbard settled back for a long wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive years after Jan Shortmire's death, the intercom on Peter Hubbard's\ndesk buzzed and his secretary's voice--his was one of the few legal\noffices wealthy enough to afford human help--said, \"Mr. Emrys Shortmire\nto see you, sir.\"\n\nHow could a man come from so many light-years' distance without\nradioing on ahead, or at least tele-calling from his hotel? Dignity\ndemanded that Hubbard tell his secretary to inform Shortmire that he\nnever saw anyone without an appointment. Curiosity won. \"Ask him to\ncome in,\" he said.\n\nThe door slid open. Hubbard started to rise, with the old-fashioned\ncourtesy of a family lawyer. But he never made it. He sat, frozen with\nshock, staring at the man in the doorway. Because Emrys Shortmire\nwasn't a man; he was a boy. He might have been a stripling of thirty,\nexcept for his eyes. Copper-bright and copper-hard they were, too hard\nfor a boy's. Give him forty, even forty-five, that would still have\nmade Jan Shortmire a father when he was nearly a hundred and twenty.\nThe longevity treatment produced remarkable results, but none that\nfantastic. Though health and strength could be restored, fertility,\nlike youth, once vanished was gone forever.\n\nYet the boy looked too sophisticated to have made a stupid mistake\nlike that, if he were an imposter. More important, he _looked_ like\nJan Shortmire--not the Shortmire whom Hubbard had known, but the\nbroad-shouldered youth of the early pictures, golden of hair and skin\nand eyes, almost classical in feature and build. Plastic surgery could\nhave converted a fleeting resemblance to a precise one, yet, somehow,\nHubbard _felt_ that this was flesh and blood of the old man's.\n\n\"You're very like your father,\" he said, inaccurately: Emrys was less\nlike his father than he should have been, given that startling identity\nof physique.\n\n\"Am I?\" The boy smiled. \"I never knew him. Of course, I know I look\nlike the pictures, but pictures never tell much, do they?\"\n\nHe had many papers to give Peter Hubbard. Too many; no honest man\nhad his life so well in order. But then Emrys' honesty was not the\nissue, only his identity. The birth certificate said he had been born\non Clergal fifty-five years before, so he was ten years older than\nHubbard's wildest estimate. A young man, but not a boy--a man of full\nmaturity, but still too young to be, normally, Jan Shortmire's son.\nThen Hubbard opened Emrys Shortmire's passport and received another\nshock.\n\nHe tried to sound calm. \"I see you were on Morethis the same time your\nfather was!\"\n\nEmrys' smile widened. \"Curious coincidence, wasn't it?\"\n\nA surge of almost physical dislike filled the lawyer. \"Is that all it\nwas--a coincidence?\"\n\n\"Are you suggesting that I pushed my father into the Ekkan?\" Emrys\nasked pleasantly.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" Hubbard was indignant at the thought that he, as a\nlawyer, would have voiced such a suspicion, even if it had occurred to\nhim. \"I thought you two might have arranged to meet on Morethis.\"\n\n\"I told you I'd never seen my father,\" Emrys reminded him. \"As for what\nI was doing on Morethis--that's my business.\"\n\n\"All I'm concerned with is whether or not you _are_ Emrys Shortmire.\"\nDistaste was almost tangible on Hubbard's tongue. \"It does seem\nsurprising that, since you _were_ on Morethis at the time your father\ndied, you should not have come to claim your inheritance sooner.\"\n\n\"I had affairs of my own to wind up,\" Emrys said flatly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHubbard tapped the papers. \"You understand that these must be checked\nbefore you receive your father's estate?\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly.\" Emrys' voice was soft as a Si-yllan\ncat-man's, and even more insulting. \"They will be gone over thoroughly\nfor any possible error, any tiny imperfection, anything that could\ninvalidate my claim. But you will find them entirely in order.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that.\" And Hubbard knew, if the papers were forgeries,\nthey would be works of art.\n\n\"You'll probably want me to undergo an equally thorough physical\nexamination for signs of--ah--surgical tampering. Yes, I see I'm\nright.\"\n\nUngenerous hope leaped inside Hubbard. \"You would object?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I'd be delighted. Haven't had a thorough medical\ncheckup for years.\" On this cooperative note, Emrys Shortmire bowed and\nleft.\n\nHubbard sighed back against the velvet cushions of his chair--real\nsilk, for he was a very rich old man. Unfortunately, he could not doubt\nthat this was Jan Shortmire's progeny. But--and Hubbard sat upright--no\nmatter how much Emrys resembled his father, that was only one parent.\nWho had the young man's mother been?\n\nQuickly, Hubbard searched through the papers for the birth certificate.\nThe name was Iloa Tasqi. The nationality: _Morethan_.\n\nNo wonder the affair had been kept so secret. No wonder Emrys seemed\nso strange and that Jan had lied about his previous visit to the dark\nplanet. Small wonder, too, that he'd had a son he was not aware of. Who\nwould have believed that human and Morethan could breed together? For\nthe Morethans, although humanoid, were not at all human.\n\nSo Emrys Shortmire was only half human. The other half was--well, the\nvidicasts called it _monster_, and, now that he had met the young man,\nPeter Hubbard was inclined to agree.\n\n\nII\n\nOutside the office building, Emrys Shortmire paused and inhaled deeply.\nSay what you would about the atmospheres of some of the other planets'\nbeing fresher and purer, the air of Earth, being the air in which Man\nhad evolved, was the air that felt best in his nostrils and filled his\nlungs to greatest satisfaction. And, after the fetid atmosphere of\nMorethis, this was pure heaven. Gray sky and violet dying sun against\nblue sky and radiant golden sun. No wonder the Morethans were what they\nwere, and Earthmen were what they were.\n\nWell, the golden sun of Earth would set somewhat sooner than the\nphysicists--or the sociologists--had prognosticated. But all that would\nbe long after he himself had died. It was no concern of his, anyway. He\nwas Emrys Shortmire, born out of Jan Shortmire and no mortal woman; and\nnothing else on Earth, or in the Universe, mattered.\n\nDisdaining the importunate heli-cabs that besieged him with plaintive\nmechanical offers of transportation, he walked down the street,\nenjoying the pull of the planet upon the youth and strength of his\nbody, delighting in the clarity of his vision and the keenness of his\nnostrils. He was so absorbed in his thoughts and so unaccustomed\nstill to Earth's traffic that he did not look where he was going. The\ngroundcar was upon him before he knew it. Of course something like this\nwould happen, he thought bitterly, as darkness descended upon him and\nhe waited for the crushing impact. It was always like that in the old\nstories, always some drawback to spoil the magic gift.\n\nBut then it was light again. The car had passed over him and he was\nunharmed, to the amazement--and disappointment--of the avid crowd that\nhad gathered.\n\n\"Pedestrians should look where they're going,\" the voice of the car\nobserved petulantly. \"Repairs cost money.\"\n\nBeing part human, Emrys was shaken by the experience. His eye caught\nthe brilliant sign of a bar. Here, he thought, would be syrup to soothe\nhis nerves. And he went inside, eager to try the taste of ancient\nvintages of Earth--unobtainable on the other planets, since fine wines\nand liquors could not endure the journey through space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sipped a whisky and soda, trying not to feel disappointed at the\nsavor. As he drank, he felt eyes upon him--the bartender's. Yet the\nlong Qesharakan reflecting glass above the bar showed him nothing\nunusual about his appearance. Did the bartender know who he was? How\ncould he?\n\nThen Emrys noticed that the man glanced from him to someone else--a\ngirl sitting at the other end of the bar. As she met Emrys' eye, she\nsmiled at him. Absently, with remote appreciation of her good looks,\nhe smiled back, then returned to the contemplation of his drink. The\nbartender's expression deepened to amused contempt.\n\nEmrys realized what was wrong and he could hardly keep from laughing.\nSo intent had he been on the pursuit of his goal that he had almost\nlost sight of the goal itself. Deliberately, he turned his head and\nsmiled at the girl. She promptly smiled back.\n\nHe sat down at her side. Now that he was close, her aquamarine hair\nshowed dark at the roots, and, through the thick golden maquillage,\nthe pores stood out on her nose. Also, she was not so very young. He\nlaughed then, and, when she asked why, bought her a drink. After he had\nbought her several more, they went to her apartment--a luxurious one in\na good section of town. She was not going to be cheap, but, he thought\nwith rising anticipation, he could afford her.\n\nHowever, the night was curiously unsatisfactory. For him--apparently\nnot for the girl, because the next morning she indignantly refused his\nmoney. Evidently the experience had been something out of the ordinary\nfor her. He could not feel it was her fault that it had been nothing\nfor him; the lack was in _him_, he thought, some almost-felt emotion he\ncould not recapture.\n\nPromising to call her, he left, went back to his hotel room and flung\nhimself upon the resilient burim-moss couch.\n\nHis body wasn't tired, but his head ached wearily. The liquor,\nnaturally, on an empty stomach ... after all those years of Morethan\nqumesht. And then the trip. Even with the Shortmire engines--standard\nequipment now, of course--it had taken a long, tiring time, for\nMorethis was the most distant of all the civilized planets. Anyone\nwould be exhausted after such a trip. Added to all this, the accident.\nThere were no bruises on his body yet, but later, he knew, they would\nbe visible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last he slept, or seemed to, and dreamed he was on Morethis\nagain--or Morethis was there with him. The air thickened about him\ninto the tangible atmosphere of the dark planet--the swirling aniline\nfog that never cleared. And in the midst stood Uvrei, the high priest,\nrobed in amethyst and sable. The term _high priest_ was vulgar as\napplied to him, but the nearest terrestrial equivalent to what he was.\n\nThe lips in the shockingly beautiful face parted. \"How goes it, son of\nmy spirit?\" the familiar greeting rolled out, in the familiar voice,\ndeep yet sweet, like dulcet thunder.\n\n\"My head hurts, father of my soul.\" Emrys knew his voice was a petulant\nchild's, yet he could not stop himself. \"I was promised--\"\n\n\"You have not taken care,\" the ancient one said.\n\nHow ancient he was, Emrys did not know. The priests of Morethis were,\nthey said, immortal. And they did live for a long, long time, far\nlonger than the common people, whom they resembled only vaguely.\nTerrestrial scholars said the ruling class was a variant of the\nMorethan race, inbred to preserve its identity, probably closer to the\noriginal world-shaking Morethans than their debased followers. The\nmembers of this group seemed young, as coin faces seem young, also old,\nlike coins themselves.\n\n\"I warned you it takes time for the final adjustments to be made. Wait,\nmy son; haste means nothing to you.\"\n\n\"But I've waited so long,\" Emrys complained.\n\n\"Wait a little longer, then. You have all the time in the world.\"\n\nThe fog swirled shut about him, and Emrys sank into his personal miasma\nof sleep. When he woke up, late that afternoon, he knew from the dank\nodor clinging to the bedclothes that it had not been a dream, that\nthe priests, the \"gods,\" the \"immortals\" of Morethis could, as they\nprofessed--and even he had not believed them in this--project their\nminds far through space ... though, fortunately, not their bodies, or\nthey would not have needed him. He remembered then the vial of tiny\ngolden pellets Uvrei had given him before he left Morethis, and took\none. Perhaps that was what the ancient one had meant. At any rate,\nEmrys thought he felt better afterward.\n\nHe examined his body in the mirror to see if bruises had come, but\nthe tawny, muscle-rippled flesh was unmarked. At length he put on his\nclothes and, leaving the hotel, went to a jeweler, where he bought a\ncostly bracelet to be sent to the girl of the night before. Such a\ngrandiose gesture relieved him--he had always felt--of all further\nobligation.\n\nHe did not wish to repeat his experience with the liquor, so he did not\ngo to a bar. He had no friends on Earth--nor could he have acknowledged\nthem if he had. He did not wish to repeat his disappointment of the\nprevious night, so he did not seek female companionship--although it\nwas obvious from the eyes of the women he passed that he would have no\ndifficulty whenever he changed his mind. But what should he do? What\ndid young men do with their leisure, he tried to remember, when they\nhad nothing but leisure?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe dined alone, finally, on a variety of rare terrestrial foods that\ndid not taste quite as he expected, and went to the theater. The play\nwas one he had seen a hundred times before under a hundred different\nnames on many different planets. He went then to a nightclub, but it\nwas crowded and noisy, and the girls did not excite him. Going back to\nthe hotel, he found that sleep, at least, came easily.\n\n_But I did not_, he thought, _do what I did merely for the sake of a\ngood night's rest._\n\nThe third day, he wandered into a museum. He found himself less bored\nthan he had expected. Perhaps culture would be most therapeutic for him\nuntil he reached his ultimate adjustments. Accordingly, he went from\nthe museum to a revival of a nineteenth-century opera. He didn't like\nit; in fact, it disturbed him so much that he left before the final\ncurtain and walked through the streets for hours, until he ran into a\ngirl who was also walking the streets, and went home with her.\n\nThe experience with the drab, as with the courtesan, was mechanically\nsatisfactory, emotionally inadequate. He paid her--knowing she, too,\nwould have given herself for nothing, had she known how--and went to\nhis hotel limp with the same not-physical weakness he had felt before.\nThe effects of the trip or the accident were lingering. He half\nexpected Uvrei to appear that night, but the old one did not come. Why\nshould he? This talk of spirit-son and soul-father was sophistry; there\nhad been a bargain and each had kept his part.\n\nThe afternoon of the fourth day, a vidicast reporter called to ask\nwhether Emrys Shortmire was any relation to the Jan Shortmire who had\ninvented the space-warp engines. Emrys could not deny his identity\nwithout jeopardizing his inheritance; however, he refused to be\ninterviewed personally or let his picture be used. He did not, he said,\nwant to be dwarfed by his father's reputation. Nonetheless, his arrival\nwas mentioned on the newscasts and panic rose up in him when he heard\nhis name spoken publicly.\n\nThe next day a letter came for him. People rarely wrote letters\nany more, except to the distant planets, yet this one had an Earth\npostmark. Cold with panic again, he tore it open and read:\n\n    My dear Mr. Shortmire:\n\n    This evening's vidicast informed me that you were on Earth. You\n    will not, I am sure, know my name. However, I was a friend of your\n    father's, when we were both young men, and it would give me great\n    pleasure to make your acquaintance.\n\n    NICHOLAS DYALL\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEmrys crumpled up the letter and hurled it across the room. He knew\nDyall for an old--associate of Jan Shortmire's, but he had not\nthought him to be alive. What had Dyall done to warrant the longevity\ntreatment? He was nothing but a glorified machinist, a technician. And\nnow he might wreck all of Emrys' plans. But if the young man made no\nreply, perhaps the old one would take the hint. And so it turned out;\nthere was no further word from Nicholas Dyall.\n\nFinally, two weeks after Emrys had first come to Earth, he got a\ntelecall from Peter Hubbard. His documents were all in order and\nhe could receive his inheritance as soon as he passed the physical\nexamination.\n\nEmrys went to the doctor's offices feeling a cold touch of apprehension\nagain. But all Dr. Jameson said when the examination was finished\nwas, \"You have the physique of a man fifteen years your junior, Mr.\nShortmire.\"\n\nEmrys fastened his tunic with fingers that shook from relief. \"Guess\nI'm lucky,\" he muttered.\n\nThe doctor cleared his throat. \"Peter Hubbard was telling me about your\nmother, that she was....\"\n\nHubbard, that old fool! And Emrys had been so sure of his discretion.\n\"My mother was Morethan, yes.\" Then he realized it was possible\nthat Hubbard, too, had felt there might be something not-quite-human\nmanifest in his body and had tried to prepare the doctor. Emrys made\nhis tone more conciliatory. \"On both Morethis and Earth, the child\ntakes citizenship from the father, so--\"\n\n\"I wasn't worrying about any legal problems; I was merely thinking that\nmedical science would be interested.\"\n\n\"I do not wish the fact of my--of my birth publicized in any way--until\nafter my death,\" Emrys added placatorily. \"Surely you can understand\nwhat hell life would become if people knew I was half Morethan?\"\n\nThe doctor sighed. \"Yes, I know. I can't blame you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Doctor,\" Emrys asked tensely, \"is there anything about me\nthat doesn't seem ... quite human?\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head. \"Only that you're so young for your age. Mr.\nShortmire, was your mother one of the caste they call the 'immortals'?\"\nThen he flushed. \"Forgive me. I didn't mean to violate--\"\n\nEmrys laughed sourly. \"Don't worry; I don't hold to the Morethan\nbeliefs. She was one of the so-called gods, yes. They do live somewhat\nlonger than either the common people or terrestrials; I guess that's\nwhy the legend arose, probably why I look so young, too. I should be\nglad I didn't inherit a--less pleasant trait.\"\n\n\"You should, indeed,\" the doctor said somberly.\n\n\nIII\n\n\"I love you, Emrys,\" the woman said, and died agonizedly in his arms.\nHe looked down at the contorted, leaden face, ravaged by sickness, and\nthought: _Even when she was beautiful, I could not love her._ He could\nnot even feel sorry for her, except in a remote, intellectual way. He\ncould not even feel sorry for himself and his own inability to feel.\n\nSince none of the servants was left in the house--those who were\nstill alive had fled to the country, where there was less chance\nof contagion--he took her body to the crematorium himself. Other\npeople were there, consigning their grisly burdens to the automatic\nfires--thin, sickly creatures they were, who would soon be carrion\nfor the firebirds themselves. Whereas he--if he had an emotion left,\nit would be shame--shame for the radiant youth and health that he saw\nmirrored in their dully wondering eyes.\n\nOutside, the street was clamorous with the taped importunities of the\nempty vehicles--so many machines, because there were so few people\nleft. But he chose to walk.\n\nThe air was sweet and clean, because the Dyall machines came and took\naway the bodies of those who fell in the street, and then cleaned those\nstreets as carefully and tenderly as they had done when the walks and\ngutters had abounded with the vibrant slovenliness of the living. Emrys\ncould, of course, have thrown the woman's body out into the gutter,\nand the machines would have carried her in their steel maws to the\ncrematorium. But some remembered emotion had kept him from doing such a\nthing, and had made him give her to the flames with what small ceremony\nhe could muster.\n\nShe had been the last mistress remaining to him, and probably, he\nthought, to any man in the city. Perhaps, out in the country, there\nmight be women with life and lust in them still, but such women as were\nleft here could no longer be considered women. This last one had not\nbeen even human for the past week; yet he had tended her--why, he could\nnot say, except that he had nothing better to do. For one thing, she\nhad been quieter when he was near her, and he could not bear her cries.\n\nHe was glad when she did die, because playing the good Samaritan had\ngrown tedious as, in their turn, all other roles had palled. Even\nthough he knew there would be no more women for him, he was glad.\nDuring the first few weeks of the plague, when everyone who had been\nalive had known that soon they would be dead, all the people on Earth\nhad rushed to squander the life which suddenly seemed to fill them to\nbursting. Then a man could have had all the women he wanted, all of\nanything he wanted, for the asking, except the one thing he really\nwanted--the assurance of life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot everyone had plunged into an orgy of joyless pleasure. There were\nsome who took refuge in prayer--addressed either to the traditional\nDeity or to the recent importations from the other planets. But, in\nthe end, it was the same for all, prayerful and profligate alike. The\nonly exceptions were the lucky few who seemed to be immune, like Emrys\nShortmire, and those who escaped from the cities--to the country or, if\nthey were rich, the other planets. So, even if Emrys had craved women\nbefore, he would have had enough of them by now.\n\nAs he passed through the streets, he heard a man who walked alone and\ntalked to himself curse the name of Jan Shortmire. _They would tear\nme to pieces if they knew I was his flesh and blood_, Emrys thought,\nand smiled to think how once he had feared to be engulfed by Jan\nShortmire's reputation, and now he feared to be destroyed by it.\n\nFor it had been a starship equipped, like all starships, with the\nShortmire engines that had brought back the plague--a starship probing\nthe distant corners of the Galaxy which were all that Man's insatiable\ncuriosity had left undiscovered.\n\nFar out, even beyond Morethis--outermost of the discovered planets--in\nthe middle of the dead and dying stars that were all there was in this\nchill, cold sector of space, the ship had come upon three dead planets,\ndark and lifeless. But when it returned to Earth to report the end of\nMan's ambitions for further conquest, it turned out that one planet\nhad not been quite as lifeless as they had fancied. And the ship had\nbrought back its life--a virus against which terrestrial medicine was\npowerless.\n\nEmrys could have fled the city; he could have fled the planet. But\nsomehow, after three years on Earth, he had not wanted to. He had spent\nthose years fulfilling the dreams that all young men dream in the murky\npart of their souls but seldom have the chance to gratify.\n\nAs soon as the inheritance was his, he had bought the most lavish\nmansion that was available at the instant of his desire, furnished\nit extravagantly, and prepared to enjoy himself. His pleasures were\nmany and, some of them, strange. At first his mistresses were human,\nthen non-human. Females of all the intelligent species, save the\nMorethan, were to be found on Earth, and although consorting with\nextraterrestrials was illegal, still a wealthy man had never been too\nmuch troubled by laws.\n\nBut women--females--represented only a fraction of his pleasures, as\ndid the terrestrial vices. He indulged heavily in rrilla, zbokth,\nmburrje, and all the other outworld pursuits that had been imported\nfrom the planets where the native life had been intelligent enough for\ndecadence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHowever, though he pushed his body a thousand times beyond what should\nhave been the limits of his endurance, the distress he had suffered\nduring the first hours of his landing on Earth did not recur. He\nremained as clear of eye and trim of form as ever; each physical excess\nseemed only to improve his splendid health.\n\nOddly, he did not seem to enjoy these pleasures as much as he had\nanticipated. Something seemed lacking. It was always like this when\nyou dreamed too long about something, he told himself; no result ever\nequaled its expectation. And he took another one of the sparkling pills\nfrom Morethis. They provided the only satisfaction he seemed able to\nget.\n\nEmrys had been wrong about Uvrei's indifference. He apparently did\nconsider Emrys his responsibility, over and above the material details\nof the bargain. The Morethans regarded all those of alien species as\nenemies, and all those outside the clan as unfriends. Therefore, Emrys\nbegan to realize the ceremonies of adoption he had gone through were\nmore than merely honorific or ritual--they had been genuine. It was an\nuncomfortable conclusion.\n\n\"Well, son of my spirit,\" Uvrei would keep asking, \"is this what you\nwanted?\"\n\n\"This is what I wanted, father of my soul,\" Emrys would agree. And it\nwas what he had asked, what he had _thought_ he wanted.\n\nThe ancient one would smile and say, \"Then I am content,\" and recombine\ninto fog. And Emrys would wonder whether the Morethans had not _known_\nbefore they granted him his heart's desire that it would turn to dust\nand ashes when he had it. Then he would dismiss the thought, telling\nhimself maybe he'd been too impatient for pleasure. After all, how\ncould he, sprung full-blown into a quasi-alien society, hope to become\nan integral part of it all at once?\n\nSo he had waited ... one year, two years, three years. At the end of\nthe fourth, the plague had struck. And he had stayed on Earth, because\ngoing to another planet somehow did not seem worthwhile. He was able\nto take care of his house alone, since the servants had been primarily\nfor show, and the great Dyall machine--which was all the house,\nessentially, was--could run itself. Whenever a part of it broke down,\nhe repaired it himself, glad of the opportunity to have something to do\nwith his hands.\n\nFinally he realized that he must be immune; hence a lifetime waited\nahead of him. So he turned to learning, for the vast libraries of tapes\nand books remained changeless amid the disaster. He read and he learned\na great deal, and if he could not derive pleasure from this, at least\nthere was a deep intellectual appreciation that almost took its place.\n\nThe doctors on Ndrikull, the most advanced of the other planets, at\nlast managed to find a serum that would kill the plague--that is,\nthey maintained it was their serum that had killed it. Some suggested\nthat the virus had died because Earth's environment had eventually\nproved hostile to it. But Earth did not die, even though most of its\npeople had, because the great machines that took care of it--the Dyall\nmachines--had kept functioning.\n\nGradually, most of the people who had fled to the other planets came\nback, and those who had survived in the country returned to the\ncities. Earth was restored to its former splendor as the social and\npolitical capital of the Galaxy, though Ndrikull now was the financial\ncenter and rivaled Earth for artistic honors. But still Emrys stuck to\nhis books. Once in a while, he would sink himself for a week or a month\nin what would be, for other men, physical pleasure, just to see if his\nreactions had changed, but they had grown even more impersonal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Emrys Shortmire had been ten years on Earth, he eventually ran\ninto Nicholas Dyall, at the opening of a scientific exposition. As soon\nas he saw Dyall in the crowd, he turned to go, but Dyall had seen him\nat the same time, and hurriedly limped across the room.\n\n\"You must be Emrys Shortmire,\" he declared, in a voice of surprising\nresonance for so old a man. \"You look so much like Jan, I couldn't be\nmistaken.\" Grasping his stick with one hand for support, he extended\nthe other to Emrys, who could not refuse it. \"But you are so young....\"\n\n\"I'm older than I look,\" Emrys said uncomfortably; then remembered to\nadd, \"You were a friend of my father's, sir?\"\n\n\"A hundred years ago, yes. My name is Nicholas Dyall.\"\n\n\"I've heard of you; you're the man who--who invented all those\nmachines,\" Emrys said, trying not to sound too ingenuous. \"I've heard\npeople say you revolutionized our technology as much as--\"\n\n\"As much as your father revolutionized our civilization? Yes, both of\nus are responsible for a great deal. Luckily, your father is dead.\"\n\n\"Luckily?\" Emrys echoed.\n\n\"Luckily for him, I mean.\" The old man sighed. \"But you are too young\nto understand.\" Then his dark face relaxed into a smile. \"I won't ask\nif you received the letter I sent when you first arrived on Earth. I\ncan understand that a young man would wish the society of other--young\npeople.\"\n\nEmrys avoided Dyall's eye, and, so doing, met the gaze of the girl\nstanding next to the old man, and stopped, transfixed. She was very\nyoung, less than forty, he judged, perhaps even less than thirty.\n\nIt was long since he had seen a woman like her. Her hair was a soft\nyellow, the only natural color among all the women in the room. Her\nface was painted pink and white, not the blues fashionable that year.\nInstead of being twisted and bedizened with cloth into fantastic shapes\nand protuberances, her pretty body was clad in a simple translucent\nslip. Yet, in spite of her almost deliberate dowdiness, she was\nbeautiful--not the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, but the\nmost ... no, striking was not it, either. What _was_ the word he\nwanted? He could not dredge it out of the pool in which so many of his\nmemories had been submerged for want of room.\n\n\"This is my great-great-granddaughter Megan,\" Dyall introduced her. The\ngirl nodded and smiled. After a moment, Emrys forced himself to do the\nsame.\n\n\"I won't press you to come visit us, Mr. Shortmire,\" Dyall said to\nEmrys as he and his descendant finally turned to leave, \"but I hope\nthat you will.\"\n\n\"We should be so glad to see you,\" the girl said, with a shy smile.\n\n\"Perhaps--perhaps I will come,\" he found himself saying. \"One\nday.\" The two men shook hands, and Nicholas Dyall and his\ngreat-great-granddaughter moved away. Emrys stared after them for a\nminute; then, without paying any attention to the exhibits, he went\nback to his house and spent the rest of the evening staring at the\nfalling flakes in his snowplace.\n\nFor years, he had thought he'd lost any capacity to feel. Now he knew\nthat was not true ... because he had been moved by Megan Dyall. How,\nhe could not say--not even whether it was love or hate he felt toward\nher--but he _felt_. That was the important thing, and, because of that,\nhe had to take the risk and call on them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waited a week, then went to the Dyall house--a mansion, less\nostentatious than his, but probably more expensive. Dyall greeted him\nwarmly. \"I'm glad you decided to come. Your father and I were not close\nfriends, but he was the only one left of my generation whom I knew. It\nwas a shock to hear of his passing, even though I hadn't seen him for a\ncentury or so.\"\n\n\"You've lived for such a long time, Grandpa,\" Megan said in her high,\nsweet voice, \"it's hard to imagine. But why doesn't everybody get the\nlongevity treatment, so we can all live a long time?\"\n\n\"Because it's difficult and expensive,\" her ancestor said, smiling over\nher golden head at Emrys. \"Because the old must make way for the young.\nIt is only given to those whose lives, the government feels, should be\nprolonged, either because of the contributions they can still make, or\nwhose contributions have already been so great that this is the only\nfitting reward.\"\n\nThe girl stared at him with large blue eyes. \"Does that mean you will\nlive forever, Grandpa?\"\n\n\"No,\" the old man told her. \"All our science can give is an extra\nhalf century. I don't know how long my life span would have been, but\nI'm past the average and the extra half century, and so I'm living on\nborrowed time.\"\n\nThe blue eyes filled with tears. \"I don't want you to die, Grandpa. I\ndon't want to grow old and die, either.\"\n\nDyall looked down at her, and there was, Emrys thought, an odd\nperplexity in his gaze. Didn't he find it natural for a young girl not\nto like the idea of old age, of death?\n\n\"But I shall want to die when my time comes, Megan,\" Dyall said. \"We\nall will.\" Gently, he touched her cheek. \"Perhaps, by the time you make\nyour contribution to society, scientists will know how to give youth as\nwell as extra years. More years are not really much of a gift to the\nold.\"\n\n\"But I can't do anything, Grandpa,\" she sobbed. \"I have nothing to\ncontribute.\"\n\nIt was an outrage, Emrys thought, that this woman, by being the essence\nof femininity, should be denied the ultimate reward society had to\noffer. Motherhood alone should entitle her.... He was, of course,\nalready envisioning himself as the father of her children. _But could\nhe be a father?_\n\nOld Dyall was saying, \"Perhaps, Megan, by the time you are old enough,\nour government will be wise enough to realize that beauty, of itself,\ndeserves the greatest reward Man can give.\" He turned to Emrys.\n\"Forgive me for getting so sentimental, but Megan looks as uncannily\nlike her great-great-grandmother--my wife--as ... you look like your\nfather. I can't bear to think she must die, too. It's a pity there is\nno way she can stay young and beautiful for all time.\"\n\nEmrys found his fists clenching. The fingers were cold.\n\n\"Alissa's portrait was painted just before I married her,\" the old man\nsaid. \"She was just about Megan's age then. Come, I'd like you to see\nit.\"\n\n_No!_ something inside Emrys cried out, but he could not\ncourteously--or any other way--refuse to follow the old man.\n\nThey went into another room. Hanging over the mantelpiece was the\npainting of a girl in old-fashioned clothes. Anyone, not knowing, would\nhave taken her to be Megan. But Emrys knew she was not, and suddenly he\nlet himself remember what it was that Megan meant to him ... and why he\nhated Nicholas Dyall with such coruscating fury.\n\n\nIV\n\n\"You should have sent for me to come to you, Mr. Hubbard,\" Nicholas\nDyall said, with a gentle pity that infuriated the old lawyer, who knew\nthat he himself was young enough to be Dyall's grandson. Hubbard was\njealous--he would not conceal it from himself--bitterly jealous. It had\nnot been hard for him to rationalize Jan Shortmire's gift of years as\na worthless one; that old man's bitterness and disillusionment had not\ninspired envy. But this hale and rosy old man seemed to be enjoying his\nyears.\n\n_I may not have made any signal contribution to human welfare_, Hubbard\nthought resentfully, _but I have done my best. Why must I die at an age\nfifty years short of the age which this man is allowed to reach?_\n\n\"I am perfectly able to get about, Mr. Dyall,\" he said in icy tones,\n\"since I am in excellent health.\"\n\nWhich he was, the doctor had told him, adding, however, \"for your age.\"\n\n\"What is more,\" Hubbard continued, \"since I was on Ndrikull, it might\nhave seemed rather presumptuous for me to send for you; whereas I had\nalways been planning to return to Earth one day. I left at the time of\nthe plague.\"\n\n\"You were wise. I merely retired to the country. I escaped the\nvirus, but the rest of my family was less fortunate. I have but one\nremaining--my great-great-granddaughter.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hubbard said, \"I know. It's because of her I've come to see\nyou.\"\n\nHe had not really planned ever to return to Earth. Ndrikull had been\ncomfortable and a man of his age did not risk a trip through space\nunless the need was urgent. The memory of Emrys Shortmire had disturbed\nhim from time to time, but, he thought, probably the young man had died\nof the plague. Even if he had not, what good would it do for Peter\nHubbard to be present on Earth? He could not counteract the presence of\nan evil force without knowing the quality of that evil.\n\nThen, picking up the kind of journal he did not usually read, he\nhad seen mentioned the fact that Jan Shortmire's son was \"courting\"\nNicholas Dyall's great-great-granddaughter. And he had known the need\nwas now urgent. He must go back to Earth and warn someone; it was his\nduty. A letter could not convey the hatred and fear with which the\nyoung man had inspired him. Obviously, old Dyall had been the person to\nwarn. Yet he did not seem right.\n\n_I do not like this man_, Hubbard thought. And then: _This is the\nsecond man I have taken such an instant dislike to. Can it be senility\nrather than perceptiveness, and have I been foolish to come all this\nway?_\n\n\"You've come because of Megan?\" Dyall raised eyebrows that were still\nthick and black. \"Have you met her? Do you know her?\" His voice\nsharpened. \"She has never spoken of you.\"\n\n\"I have never met her,\" Hubbard said, and saw Dyall relax. Hubbard\nwaited, but the other man said nothing, so he went on, \"I wanted to\ntalk to you about the man she's been seeing, this Emrys Shortmire.\"\nLeaning forward, Hubbard spoke slowly, as if, by giving weight to\neach word, he could make them sound less fantastic. \"He's a monster.\nLiterally, I mean. His mother was a Morethan. Or _is_. For all I know,\nshe may still be alive.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHubbard had not thought of this before, and it shook him. Yet, if Iloa\nTasqi was alive, then Emrys Shortmire must be considered to be, to all\nintents and purposes, Morethan entirely, working only for the interests\nof that planet. After all, his mother had been the only parent the\nboy had known. Even on Clergal, he must have been brought up under a\nstrong Morethan influence. Now, if the female was still alive, then the\ninfluence would be alive, too. Since Morethans were not permitted on\nEarth, there would be an obvious advantage for them in having someone\nhere.\n\nDyall was holding back a smile, not too well. \"I didn't know a human\nand a Morethan could--ah--breed together.\"\n\nAnd, obviously, he didn't believe it. There was no way Hubbard could\nprove it, unless he asked Emrys to produce his birth certificate again.\n\"It isn't generally known that the two species can reproduce together,\"\nhe finally said, \"nor should it be.\"\n\nThen he looked directly in Dyall's black eyes--impossible that eyes\nso keen should be so deliberately blind, that any aware human being\nshould not have sensed _something_ of that dark aura. \"Haven't you felt\nsomething strange about young Shortmire?\" he asked.\n\n\"Can't say I have,\" Dyall chuckled. \"He seems an agreeable enough young\nfellow.\"\n\n\"He's sixty-five years old.\"\n\n\"Really? I should have taken him to be younger. But youth lasts longer\nthese days. And there's--\" Dyall gave a little laugh--\"no crime in\nbeing old, or you and I would be in prison, wouldn't we?\"\n\nHubbard would not let himself be distracted. \"He looked less than forty\nwhen he came to Earth, and he hasn't, I understand, changed in the past\nten years.\"\n\n\"Ten years is not so long.\" Dyall's swarthy hands began playing with\nthe ornaments on his desk. Clearly, he was impatient to be rid of\nhis tedious caller, and Hubbard struggled with the instinctive good\nbreeding that told him to get up and leave. This was not a social call,\nso it did not matter that he was boring his host, however.\n\nOn the other hand, he was not getting anywhere. Perhaps he could\n_blast_ the other out of his smugness. \"Look, Dyall, I know this is an\noutrageous thing for a man of my profession to say. I haven't a shred\nof proof, not a suspicion--but I'm morally sure he killed his father.\"\n\nInstead of showing shock or anger or even thought, Dyall merely gave\nhim a tolerant smile. \"You're an old man, Mr. Hubbard. We're both old\nmen,\" he amended graciously, \"so we're apt to--jump at shadows.\"\n\n_I'm an old man_, Hubbard thought angrily, _and you're an old fool!_\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the young man,\" Dyall\ncontinued, \"or not-so-young man, if you prefer. He appears to be very\nfond of Megan, and if he should choose to marry her, it would ease my\nmind considerably. I've exceeded my life span myself, you know.\"\n\nSince Peter Hubbard had done the same, and his span was considerably\nshorter, he had no sympathy. \"You'd--let the strain continue?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's a good strain. I understand the Morethans are said to be\nimmortal. If so, the genes might be a desirable addition to our own.\"\n\nHe was laughing openly now. Hubbard almost wept with helplessness.\nThere must be _something_ he could do. But what? He could not take the\ntrip to Morethis; he would certainly die on the way. And what could\nhe do there? There was no guarantee that, if there was anything to be\nfound, he would find it, or even if he reached the planet alive, that\nhe would go back alive.\n\n\"Won't you stay and dine with us tonight, Mr. Hubbard?\" Dyall asked.\n\n\"No--no, thank you,\" Hubbard said, feeling no necessity for making an\nexcuse. The offer had represented only the barest kind of courtesy.\n\nDyall got up. \"Perhaps another night then?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" Hubbard rose to his feet also, trying to appear brisk and\nalert and _young_. At least he could walk without aid, he thought,\nstaring pointedly at the stick leaning against the wall. \"I would\nrather you didn't tell Shortmire I had come to see you about him.\"\n\n\"Of course not, if you wish.\"\n\nBut Hubbard knew Dyall would not keep the stranger's visit from his\nfriend. Odd that Dyall and young Shortmire should be friends. Not so\nodd either, though; young Shortmire had no reason to love his father.\nBesides, although Jan Shortmire had hated Nicholas Dyall, that did not\nmean Nicholas Dyall had hated Jan Shortmire, or even knew of the other\nman's animosity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he was riding back to his hotel, Hubbard let his tired old body\nindulge the aches and pains that were its rightful heritage. As his\nbody relaxed, his mind relaxed, and he began to think more clearly.\nPerhaps Dyall would not listen to him--perhaps Dyall had some reason\nfor not listening--but the government might.\n\nWhat young Shortmire might have done as a human, they would consider a\nmatter for local law--but the fact that human and Morethan had begotten\noffspring would interest them. The fact that the Morethans might have\nmanaged at last to get a spy on Earth would interest them. If Emrys\nwould not surrender his birth certificate, they could get another from\nClergal. Only, would the government's representative believe Hubbard\nenough to get that birth certificate? Or would they, like Dyall,\ndismiss him as a doddering old fool?\n\nThe private humiliation had been hard enough; he hated to risk a public\none. But it was his duty to tell officialdom of his suspicions, he knew\nmiserably. Never again could he think with pride of himself as a worthy\ncitizen if he didn't at least make the attempt. Never again could\nhe let himself feel a justifiable jealousy of those with endowments\nsuperior to his, if he did not prove himself worthy of what he had.\n\nWell, there was no hurry; he would sleep on it. He was mistaken. In\nthe morning, before he had even started to decide upon any course of\naction, the front desk called to announce that a Mr. Shortmire wished\nto see him.\n\n\"Very well,\" the old lawyer said wearily into the machine, _to_ the\nmachine, for it was the Dyall itself speaking. \"Send him up.\"\n\nA short while later, there was a rap on the door. \"Come in,\" Hubbard\ncalled.\n\nThe door slid open. A man entered, a tawny golden youth with eyes like\nburnished metal. \"Do you know who I am, Peter?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Hubbard said, faintly disgusted, since he considered\nmelodrama vulgar. \"You're Emrys Shortmire.\"\n\n\"You're wrong,\" the man said. \"I'm Jan Shortmire.\"\n\n\nV\n\nEmrys Shortmire had gone home the night Dyall had shown him the\nportrait of his long-dead wife, and Emrys had dreamed, not of Megan\nDyall, but of Alissa Embel, Megan's great-great-grandmother, whom he\nhad wanted a hundred years before, and who had married Nicholas Dyall.\nConsciously, he had forgotten her, but at the back of his mind, she\nhad, for over a century, walked hand in hand with his hatred.\n\nThat night he understood what he had not realized then. He had\ncompleted the engines with which he had been tinkering for years\nwith a real vengeance. He had taken the first starship out into\nspace himself--when no one had faith in his engines, least of all\nhimself--merely \"to show her\" what a great man he was, even if he died\nin the showing. In his spite, he had opened up the stars for mankind.\n\nAnd when he returned, years later, he found that Dyall, too, had\nstopped tinkering and had changed the pattern of his gadgets to one\nmore acceptable to the public taste. Before, they had operated quite\nsatisfyingly, but they had not been salable in the shape he had given\nthem, and no manufacturer had been interested in leasing the patents.\nNow that he had yielded, manufacturers were falling all over themselves\nto get the right to produce his machines.\n\nDyall's was not as soul-stirring a success as Shortmire's--he did not\ninspire cheering crowds and parades--but a more enduringly popular\none. The Shortmire engines carried humanity to the stars, but it was\nthe Dyall machines that cooked humanity's dinners and kept its houses\nclean. So humanity respected Jan Shortmire and took Nicholas Dyall to\nits collective heart.\n\nEmrys awakened, remembering all this and rigid with loathing for\nNicholas Dyall, and for the world which had allowed Nicholas Dyall to\ntake from him something he had wanted. Something which had, as soon as\nhe'd known for sure he'd lost it forever, become what he wanted most.\nAnd also he hated the world which had given Alissa Embel to Dyall\nand had then proceeded to heap on him in addition every honor Jan\nShortmire himself had won in an effort to make up for what he'd lost.\nJan Shortmire had risked his life in space; Nicholas Dyall had sat\ncomfortably in his chair--and both were equally honored.\n\nThen Emrys--as Emrys--caught hold of himself. It was true that\noriginally there had been injustice. But it had been righted and so\nthere was no more reason to hate Dyall. _I have a second chance, but he\nwill have none. I will live out another full lifetime, and I will have\nMegan, too, and he'll die in a few years. And as for the world, I have\nalready revenged myself on it in advance._\n\nHe got up and pulled a spun-metal robe about him, amethyst and sable--a\ngift from Morethis. There was always a costly gift on his birthday,\neither out of kindness or cruelty, together with a vial of the golden\ncapsules.\n\nWhat a pity, he thought, as he went downstairs, that Dyall and the\nworld both would never know the truth: that Jan Shortmire had no son,\nthat Emrys and Jan Shortmire were one.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Morethans first came to Jan Shortmire when, approaching his natural\nold age, he had traveled as a visitor to their planet--largely because\nold men did not go to Morethis--and they had made him their offer. He\nhad laughed in their dark and exquisite faces.\n\n\"My own government will give me fifty years more of life,\" he said,\nfor he had heard, during the voyage out, that he would be on the next\nhonors list. \"What need do I have of you?\"\n\n\"We can give you far more than fifty years,\" they'd told him. \"And\nyouth, besides.\"\n\nAt that, he had stopped laughing, but still he had not accepted their\noffer, for many reasons ... doubt and fear, perhaps some shreds of\nhonor, and certainly, since he was a man of science, skepticism.\n\nThen, when Shortmire was nearing the end of those fifty extra\nyears which had, indeed, been granted him by a grateful Earth\ngovernment--together with a plaque, suitably inscribed--he had\nreceived a gift. It was one of those great crystalline prisms from\nMorethis that were so fashionable on Earth as lighting fixtures, not\nbecause they saved fuel--for one such prism would cost ten lifetimes\nof fuel--but because they gave a light no Earthborn device could give,\nmaking the old look young, the stupid wise, and, most important of all,\nthe ugly beautiful.\n\nShortmire looked into the lambent depths, wondering who had sent him so\ncostly and so useless a gift. Suddenly the flame vitrified into a face\nthat flashed up at him from the crystal--a face that was beautiful in\nits horror, and horrible in its beauty. He closed his eyes, but when he\nopened them, the iridescent eyes were still there, mocking him for his\ncowardice.\n\n\"I am Uvrei,\" a deep voice of tingling sweetness said, \"god among gods\nand man among men. I bring you greetings from Morethis, Jan Shortmire.\"\n\nShortmire knew well enough what Uvrei must want, for the Morethans'\nlong-ago offer had risen of late to the top of his thoughts. They could\nnot do what they claimed, he had tried to reassure himself, whenever\nthe memory returned; it was a trick which he had been clever enough not\nto fall for. But part of his mind did not believe this, and that part\nwas glad to see Uvrei.\n\n\"What do you want of me?\" he demanded.\n\nThe Morethan smiled, and each glittering tooth was a fiery brilliant.\n\"The same as before, on the same terms,\" he said, offering no\nenticements. The man who would accept such an offer would provide his\nown.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf they were capable of doing this ... thing with the crystal, then\nthey might also have other powers. So Shortmire could no longer pretend\nthat what they offered him was impossible. On the other hand, what they\nrequired of him in return was truly terrible. Could they really do what\nthey said?\n\n_After all, my world has not done overmuch for me. Others, like\nNicholas Dyall, have wealth and power and...._ He would not let himself\nthink of Alissa Dyall, since she must long be dead, of old age, if\nnothing else. The last he had heard of her was when she and Dyall had\nannounced their wedding date. Then he had taken the ship fitted out\nwith the engines everyone said would not work, and he had fled into\nspace. When he had come back, no one had spoken of her, and gradually,\nin his new-found importance, he had to some degree forgotten her,\nthough he never forgot Dyall.\n\nPity to think of Alissa as having grown old. Even more of a pity to\nthink of himself as having grown old, for he could see that in every\nmirror he passed.\n\n\"You're sure you can give me youth as well as life?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not only youth, but perpetual youth,\" Uvrei assured him. \"Youth such\nas you did not know even when you were young.\"\n\nBut Shortmire was still suspicious. Even if the Morethans could do what\nthey said, how did he know they would? An alien concept of honor might\nhave no reference to the terrestrial one. \"How do I know I can trust\nyour word?\"\n\nUvrei's face grew black, literally black, and the crystal shivered\nuntil, Emrys thought, it would split. And he shivered, too, knowing in\nthe fine nerves and little muscles of his body what would happen to him\nat the final shivering. A fear filled him then that he had never known\nbefore, not even when he faced space for the first time, and in the\nmidst of that fear came the thought that, if he truly hated Earth, this\nwas the most artistically nasty revenge he could take.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe crystal trembled to stillness as Uvrei's face paled to composure.\n\"If you were not an Earthman, Jan Shortmire,\" he said, \"we would not\nhave needed you, nor you us. And an Earthman could not be expected\nto know that the words you have just spoken are the insult that, on\nMorethis, is deadlier than death; for the word of an immortal--no\nmatter to whom or what he gives it--is as sacred and enduring as he\nhimself.\"\n\n\"I apologize,\" Shortmire said quickly, \"for my ignorance.\"\n\n\"And I forgive you,\" Uvrei declared, as grandly as if he _were_ a god,\n\"because of that ignorance. Moreover, since you cannot help your racial\ndeficiencies, I will make this bargain with you. Come to Morethis.\nThere we will give you the life and youth we promised. Then, when you\nare satisfied that we have given you what you desire, you will give us\nwhat we desire.\"\n\nNot having been too honorable a man in his own hundred and fifty-five\nyears, Jan Shortmire still could not believe that the Morethans would\nact in all honor. However, even the remote possibility that they would\nplay fair was strong temptation for an ardent man pushing death. So\nhe had agreed. He had wound up his affairs and made his will in favor\nof \"his son.\" Then he had left Earth to go to Morethis, to die as Jan\nShortmire and he resurrected as Emrys Shortmire.\n\nThe Morethans had kept their word, though there were times when he\nwished they had not. For no phoenix casting itself into the fire to\nburn alive in agony, so that it might rise again, young and strong and\npurified, from the ashes of its own dead self, could have suffered the\nexcruciating torment of both mind and body that he suffered as, little\nby little, he was made young again.\n\nUvrei had warned him that this would happen. \"To become one of us, you\nmust be capable of all-endurance.\" So, for three years, he had lived\non the miasmic planet, suffering unending, unbearable pain--not only\nhis, but of the others whose lives went to make his new life. Slowly,\nagonizingly, these were stirred into the shrieking cauldrons of his\nbody, until they blended and melted and coalesced to become his new\nshape.\n\nThen Uvrei had led him ceremoniously to a reflecting glass and shown\nhim Emrys Shortmire--a boy far more handsome than the boy Jan Shortmire\nhad been, though, at the same time, his twin. The only thing not quite\nhuman about Emrys Shortmire was his eyes, and how could they be human\nafter what they had seen? But he would forget all that once he was back\non Earth, forget the payment that had been exacted--and prepare to live\nhis new life to the full.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this Emrys Shortmire told Peter Hubbard in the quiet of the\nexpensive hotel room. It was pleasant to be able to unburden himself at\nlast. For the past eleven years, there had been a secret side of him\nthat must always walk apart, even from Megan. Now there was someone who\ncould know the whole of him, and he was grateful to Hubbard for having\ncome back to Earth.\n\nBut Hubbard sat there staring with so fixed a gaze that, for a moment,\nEmrys thought he was dead. Then he realized that it was only shock; all\nthis had been too much for so old a man. Selfishly, he had heaped his\nburden upon another, without asking whether that other was willing, or\nable, to share it.\n\n\"Peter,\" he began, \"I'm sorry....\" not quite sure for what he was\napologizing. He could not have trusted the old man at the beginning,\njust as he _had_ to trust him now. But of course he was apologizing to\nPeter Hubbard, as the representative of humanity, for what he himself\nhad done to Earth.\n\nHe began to give unasked-for explanations. \"I deliberately made you\nsuspect I killed my father, because if you suspected one of us had done\naway with the other, why, then, you'd automatically have assumed there\nwere two.\" He looked down at the floor. \"And I wanted you to hate me.\nWe couldn't be friends; otherwise, knowing me better than anyone else\nalive, you might have guessed....\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Hubbard said wearily. \"Almost anything else would have\nseemed more likely.\" Presently he asked, \"Weren't you afraid I might\ninvestigate?\"\n\nEmrys smiled. \"What could you find out? After all, I _hadn't_ killed\nJan Shortmire.\"\n\nThe smile became a little fixed. \"I wouldn't have cared even if you had\ntold someone your suspicions then,\" Emrys went on doggedly, \"because I\nknew no one would believe you. But now--\" he colored--\"well, I don't\nwant you to tell Megan Dyall anything ... bad about me. You see, I ...\nlove her.\"\n\n\"I gathered that impression,\" Hubbard said.\n\n_But why does he sound so unhappy about it?_ Emrys thought angrily.\n_What's wrong with me?_ Because he was in love, he could not appreciate\nthe irony of that thought.\n\n\nVI\n\nPeter Hubbard looked at his old friend with the young face and the\nyoung body and the eyes that were unhuman--but less so than before.\nThis was a frightful thing that had been done, and by and by he would\nfeel the full horror of it. Right now he was too numb to care. He felt,\nas Emrys Shortmire must have felt on coming back to Earth, detached and\nwithout interest. _But I've felt this way before_, he thought; _it's\nbecause I'm old._\n\n\"Were you really satisfied with your bargain, Jan?\" he asked, almost\ncasually.\n\n\"Not at first,\" the boy admitted, sinking down on the couch and\nclasping his hands around his knees. So young, so graceful, and\nso ... unnatural. \"It seemed to me then that the Morethans had given me\nyouth and taken away humanity. Because, once I found I was physically\ncapable, I found I didn't really want the things I had craved so much\nbefore.\"\n\n\"So they did trick you?\" When all was said and done, Hubbard thought,\nyou could never trust an alien life-form, a foreigner.\n\n\"No, _no_! You still don't understand. The way I see it is that ...\ncertain elements in us may not mean anything to them. They don't know\nthey're there, so they wouldn't realize that anything got lost in ...\nthe process.\"\n\n\"Do you think, Jan,\" Hubbard asked slowly, \"that the way you felt--or\ndidn't feel--might not have anything to do with the Morethans at all?\nThat, for all your young body, you are an old man and feel like an old\nman?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! I know what it is to feel like an old man, and I know what\nit is to feel like a young man, and I--I felt like neither.\"\n\n\"When a man has lived a certain number of years,\" Hubbard said, knowing\nthat envy gave the truth relish, \"he is an old man. Age is in the mind\nand heart, not only in the body.\"\n\n\"That's a lie!\" Then Emrys said, more calmly, \"If that's so, why did\neverything change when I met Megan? Because I found then that my\nemotions had not been lost! I had a feeling for her that I'd never had\nfor another woman--not even for Alissa, I think. I hadn't imagined\nthere could be a woman like Megan in the world, so sweet and amiable\nand completely feminine.\" He looked angrily at Hubbard. \"You think I'm\nsentimental, don't you?\"\n\nHubbard tried to smile. \"There's nothing wrong with sentiment.\" But\nsentimentality was characteristic of an old man's love.\n\nEmrys laughed and hugged his knees. He was overdoing the ingenuousness.\nOf course he deliberately played the part of a boy young enough to\nbe his own great-great-grandson, because he was wooing a woman young\nenough to be his own great-great-granddaughter. And Hubbard remembered\nhow he himself had attempted to move briskly before Nicholas Dyall.\nEmrys Shortmire would not have the physical aches that he'd had as\na result, but could there be psychical aches? Could an old man ever\nactually be young?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEmrys' face grew sober. \"I've never touched her, Peter--really touched\nher, I mean. She's not like other women, you know.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Hubbard said, remembering back to the time when he, too, had\nbeen in love. Only the memory was not tender in him, because he had\nmarried the girl and lived with her for nearly seventy years.\n\n\"Peter, you aren't listening!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" the old man said, waking from his reverie. \"What were you\nsaying?\"\n\n\"I said, do you think Megan would be willing to marry me, if she knew I\nwas older than her great-great-grandfather?\"\n\nBut there was a more important question that Hubbard could no longer\nrefuse to face. \"Jan, what did you give the Morethans in return for\nwhat they gave you?\"\n\n\"You haven't answered my question.\"\n\n\"I can't answer it, because I don't know the girl. But you can answer\nmine, because you know what you gave the Morethans.\"\n\nEmrys was silent for a moment; then he laughed. \"I gave them my soul,\"\nhe said lightly. \"Like that fellow in the opera.\"\n\n\"I know that. What I'm afraid of is that it wasn't enough. In what form\ndid you give it to them, Jan?\"\n\n\"You have no right to catechize me like that.\"\n\nThe old man's voice was soft. \"I think I have.\"\n\nEmrys was a long time in answering. When he finally spoke, his voice\nwas flat and dead. \"All right, I gave them the blueprints for the\nspace-warp engines. What else did I have to give them in exchange?\"\n\nHubbard expelled a long breath. He had answered this question for\nhimself many minutes before. Still, the shock of confirmation was too\ngreat. All hope was gone now. \"Perhaps you had a right to sell your own\nsoul, Jan, but you had no right to sell humanity's.\" His good breeding\nheld up all the way. This man had betrayed the whole of mankind, and so\nhe, Peter Hubbard, reproached him gently for it. Though, come to think\nof it, what good would savage recrimination--or anything--do?\n\n\"But _you_ don't have to worry about it, Peter!\" Emrys cried. \"Listen,\nthe Morethan technology is so alien, so different from ours, because\nit's based on mental rather than physical forces, that it'll take\ncenturies before they can acquire the techniques they'll need to build\nthe engines. And they'll have trouble getting the materials. We'll both\nhave been long in our graves by the time they'll reach Earth.\"\n\n\"And that makes it all right? It doesn't matter to you what happens to\nyour own home planet once you are dead?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young-looking face was flushed. \"Why should it? Does Earth care\nwhat happens to me? During the plague, they cursed my name because I\ninvented the star-engines. That's the only time Earth remembered me.\"\n\n\"During the plague, men were insane, Jan,\" Hubbard said, knowing his\nown sweet reasonableness was ludicrous under the circumstances, \"not\nresponsible for what they said. They don't curse your name any more.\"\n\n\"No, they've forgotten it.\" Emrys looked at Hubbard with blazing,\nunhuman eyes. \"Why should you expect me to put their welfare before my\nown?\"\n\n\"You must, if the race is to survive.\"\n\nHubbard expected Emrys to say, \"Why should it survive?\" but apparently\nthere was a grain of emotion left here. \"It will survive. The Morethans\nare not--\" the word seemed to stick in Emrys' throat--\"monsters.\"\n\n\"Jan,\" Hubbard said in a monotone, \"eleven years ago, after you came to\nEarth for your inheritance, I became interested in Morethis--naturally\nenough, I suppose. I started scanning everything I could lay my hands\non, and I learned a great deal about it--as much, I believe, as anyone\noff Morethis knows. Except, of course, you.\"\n\nEmrys rose and began to pace the floor. \"Nobody really knows anything\nabout Morethis. Most of what has been written is a--a pack of lies. One\nliar copied from another, and so they perpetuate the lie. Scandal has\nalways sold better than truth!\"\n\nHubbard said, \"There is a legend that the Morethans once had limited\nspace travel, though no way of warping space to bring the distant stars\ncloser, since they did not use engines. But there were many stars close\nto them, and they traveled from system to system, sucking each one dry.\nThen there were no living planets left in their sector of space, and\ntheir engineless ships could not bridge the gap to the next cluster, so\nthey found themselves trapped on a dying planet that revolved around a\ndying star, and they, as a race, began to die themselves.\"\n\nEmrys tried to laugh. \"Looks like a fine case of poetic justice, but--\"\n\n\"Wait. I haven't finished. The race did not die completely; it decayed.\nCertain among the people stayed alive through sucking the lives of\nthe others; certain among them still kept some vestiges of the old\ntraditions and knowledge; certain among them waited.\"\n\n\"Is that the end of your story?\"\n\nHubbard nodded. Emrys' face was ashen. \"Well, it's an old wives' tale,\"\nhe sputtered. \"All the Morethans want is to be able to compete on an\nequal basis with Earth. They don't want to be exploited, nor do they\nintend to....\" As his eyes caught Hubbard's, his voice trailed off.\n\"Anyhow, I'll be dead,\" he said. \"I don't give a damn what happens\nafter I'm dead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHubbard didn't believe it. He couldn't. There is no man who has not\nsome love for his own kind, be it ever so little, merely because they\nlook like him.\n\n\"You won't tell anybody who I really am?\" Emrys asked childishly.\n\"You're still my friend, aren't you?\"\n\nHubbard sighed. Was he still this creature's friend? He didn't know.\n\"Who would believe me?\" he finally asked. \"And even if they did, what's\nthe use? Nothing can be done. The only thing that's ever protected us\nfrom the Morethans is distance. When they reach Earth, they will have\nalready conquered us. Mental powers are always stronger than physical\npowers at close range.\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Emrys seemed to be relieved at the idea that the\nquestion was out of his hands. \"Too late now to do anything about it.\"\n\nHubbard nodded. There was no way out that he could see.\n\n\"But you _do_ promise not to tell old Dyall that I'm my father instead\nof me?\" Emrys asked anxiously.\n\n\"Even if he believed me, he wouldn't care. All he wants is a good\nmatch for that great-great-granddaughter of his.\"\n\nBut was that all? As far as money went, Nicholas Dyall was reputed to\nbe the richest man alive. And if he was truly fond of the girl, would\nhe not at least have investigated the young man?\n\n\"You're _hard_!\" Emrys complained, but without rancor.\n\n\"I have a suspicious nature,\" Hubbard said thoughtfully. \"Perhaps it's\nthe legal mind. At any rate, I don't care for Nicholas Dyall.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't either, but I don't really give a hang what kind of a\ngreat-great-grandfather-in-law I'm getting. All I care about is Megan.\nDo you think it's wrong for me to ask her to marry me?\"\n\n\"Can't you understand that, at this stage, the girl doesn't matter?\"\n\n\"No,\" Emrys said simply. \"I cannot imagine her not mattering.\"\n\nAfter he had gone, Hubbard still found himself thinking about Nicholas\nDyall. In his whole lifetime, the old lawyer had personally known\nonly two men whom society had deemed worthy of its highest honor, the\nlongevity treatment. And these were more than most men had met, for the\nlongevity treatment was given to very few. Both of the two, Dyall and\nShortmire, had some defect in their personalities that warped them--all\nbut completely, in Shortmire's case--away from the human virtues.\n\nWas that defect a part of the creative talent that had earned the\nindividual his right to the treatment? Or did it arise as an effect\nof the treatment itself? Because, if that was the case, then Earth's\nlongevity treatment might be nothing more than a primitive form of the\nMorethan \"process.\"\n\nSince only straws remained to be grasped at, no one thing Hubbard did\nwould be more futile than any other. And since he had nothing better to\ndo, he might just as well investigate this new avenue. Jan Shortmire\nhad hated Nicholas Dyall. Had Nicholas Dyall hated Jan Shortmire with\nequal venom? And, if so, had he done anything about it?\n\n\nVII\n\nA Gong sounded and a mechanical voice announced, \"Mr. Peter Hubbard to\nsee Mr. Dyall and Mr. Shortmire.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say he has the _gall_ to come see us, after the\naccusations he made against you, Emrys?\" Dyall demanded incredulously.\n\"I still can't understand why you sent him an invitation to the\nwedding, but that he should make a casual social call...!\"\n\n\"We've come to terms.\" Emrys smiled. \"After all, at his age, he can't\nbe held accountable for everything he says.\"\n\n\"I'm at least fifty years older than he is!\" the old engineer almost\nspat. \"And you--do you mean that I am not responsible for what I say?\"\n\nKnowing that he was the other man's senior by some twenty years\nhimself, Emrys was malevolently pleased. \"Some people retain their\nfaculties longer than others,\" he observed. \"And Hubbard was my\nfather's friend, as well as his lawyer, so he's the closest thing to\na relative that I have on Earth. Except you, of course; you were my\nfather's friend, too.\"\n\nDyall's lips tightened. \"How does Hubbard know you're in this house\nright now? Do you think he's having you followed?\"\n\nIt was possible, but Emrys didn't care. For almost a year now, his life\nhad been blameless, and, strangely, it suited him to live that way.\n\"I'm here in this house most of the time. It wouldn't be hard for him\nto figure out where he could find me.\"\n\nThe gong sounded again. Dyall looked undecided.\n\n\"If _I_ can forgive him, sir,\" Emrys said gently, \"surely _you_ can.\"\n\n\"Show him in,\" Dyall rasped to the machine.\n\nMegan rose to go, but Emrys kept hold of her small, cold hand. \"I'd\nlike you to meet Peter Hubbard, dear. He's really a nice old fellow\nwhen you get to know him. Just a bit too much of a do-gooder, that's\nall.\"\n\nDyall snorted.\n\n\"I shall be glad to know any friend of yours, Emrys,\" Megan said,\nsitting down again obediently.\n\nAfter a moment, Peter Hubbard came into the room. \"Peter, this is my\nfianc\u00e9e, Megan Dyall.\" Smilingly, Emrys waited for the usual inane\nfelicitations. He couldn't expect a man of Hubbard's age to be bowled\nover by this loveliness, but still surely no man, no matter how\nancient, could be completely insensible to the girl's charm.\n\nHubbard stood still and stared at her. \"Amazing....\" he murmured.\n\"Amazing....\" Then he turned to Dyall. \"You are to be congratulated,\nsir.\"\n\nEmrys was annoyed. He knew Hubbard was too well-bred to make a remark\nlike that unintentionally. However, he pretended to be amused and said,\n\"You're supposed to congratulate _me_, Peter.\"\n\nBut Hubbard continued his inexplicable rudeness by paying no attention\nto Emrys and, instead, staring at Nicholas Dyall. And finally Dyall\nsaid, with a strangled laugh, \"I think perhaps in this instance Mr.\nHubbard is right.\"\n\nHe threw himself into an easy chair with an attempt at nonchalance,\nbut it was embarrassingly apparent that his stick was not enough to\nsupport him any more. His old body was trembling. And Emrys found that\nhe himself was trembling, too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a painful silence. Everyone seemed to be waiting. Even Megan\nglanced from one to the other with her usual expression of bright-eyed\ninterest.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Mr. Hubbard,\" Dyall said at last, \"you've reached your\nconclusions too late to do anything except perhaps hasten an end that\nis, you'll concede, by now inevitable.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hubbard agreed, \"you've won _your_ game.\" He came a little\nfurther into the room, so that he was standing over the other old man.\n\"I do believe that, of the two, you are the worse. He did what he did\nout of spite. You created that spite and kept it alive.\"\n\nDyall's dark face flushed and his hands tightened on his cane. \"But I\nhad a right to do what I did. And I hurt only one person. Two, if you\ninclude me. Give me credit, at least, for the smallness of my scope.\"\n\nHubbard glanced at Megan. And Dyall broke into the shrill cackle of an\nold man. \"But you know, you _know_, and still you think of her! How\nsentimental can you get? Don't you realize--\"\n\n\"How much does she?\" Hubbard said. \"How much do you?\"\n\nEmrys had become nearly frantic with frustration and bewilderment. He\nwas the one who had secrets; nobody else. Nothing was to be kept hidden\nfrom _him_! \"What are you two blabbering about?\" he almost screamed.\n\"It doesn't make sense--any of it!\"\n\nHubbard turned toward him, his head and neck moving with the deliberate\nprecision of a piece of clockwork. \"It makes very good sense, Jan. I\nrealized that I could find out nothing more from the stars, so I turned\nmy researches back to Earth. I've been investigating Mr. Dyall.\"\n\n\"What did you find?\" Emrys asked tensely. Why did Peter call him by his\nformer name in front of his former enemy? Had the old fool forgotten\nhis promise, or had he broken it on purpose? \"_What did you find out?_\"\nhe repeated.\n\nHubbard's voice was filled with pity. \"Just this: Nicholas Dyall never\ndid marry Alissa Embel.\"\n\nEmrys' fear exploded into a scarlet rage. \"Then Megan is--\" He advanced\non Dyall, his fists clenched. \"If you took Alissa and then didn't--\"\n\nHubbard caught his arm in a frail grip. \"Don't be so hasty, Emrys.\nDyall did no wrong to Alissa Embel, whatever wrong he may have done to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Dyall murmured, \"for granting me that I gave her all I\nhad, but it wasn't what she wanted. She wanted--\" his old eyes were\nfilled with hate as he looked at Emrys--\"you.\"\n\n\"Alissa Embel killed herself on the day before the wedding,\" Hubbard\ntold Emrys. \"She, as we attorneys say, died without issue.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEmrys was glad that, since he could not have had Alissa, Dyall had not,\neither. At the same time, he felt an overwhelmingly poignant sense of\nsorrow, that he should have had three full lifetimes, and the woman he\nhad loved--insofar as Jan Shortmire had been capable of love--not even\none.\n\nHe raised dull eyes to the two old men. \"Then who is Megan?\"\n\nHubbard hesitated. But what worse could there be to tell? And then\nthe lawyer asked a ridiculous question, \"Jan, do you know why Dyall's\nmachines didn't meet popular favor until he changed them?\"\n\nEmrys plunged back once again into the well of his memories. \"Nobody\nwanted to buy machines that looked too much like people; it made\nthem ... uncomfortable. So Dyall stopped designing robots and made\nmachines adapted to their separate functions and--\" His voice became a\ncry of anguish. \"_Megan!_\"\n\nShe turned her bland, smiling doll face toward him. \"I'm sorry, Emrys,\"\nthe sweet voice said.\n\nDyall's eyes were squeezed shut and something glistened on the edge\nof them--something that Emrys would not admit were tears, because he\nhimself could never cry.\n\n\"When Alissa died,\" Dyall said, \"I knew I couldn't love another woman.\nSo I made a mechanical doll in her image. I made her the woman every\nman dreams of--lovely and sympathetic and undemanding. And I told\nmyself she would be better than the original Alissa because she would\nbe perfect, and Alissa wasn't; she would stay young forever, while the\nreal Alissa would have grown old ... if she had lived. But it wasn't\nthe same for me.\"\n\n_Why was she the same for me, then?_ Emrys wondered bitterly. _Was it\nbecause I didn't know? Is that all love is--self-deception?_\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Dyall went on, \"Man cannot appreciate true perfection;\nperhaps he's not good enough himself. Still, she was company of a sort\nand so I kept her by me. And then, when I read of Emrys Shortmire's\narrival on Earth, I sent him a note, but he didn't answer; however, I\ncontrived to get a look at him anyway. Then I knew for sure that he was\nJan Shortmire himself; and then I knew what Megan's destiny was....\"\n\n\"How _could_ you know he--I was Jan Shortmire?\" Emrys demanded angrily.\nIt was insupportable that old Dyall should have known all along; it\nspoiled the joke. \"Where would you have--have gotten the concept?\"\n\nThe old man smiled, opening his eyes. \"Because the Morethans made me\nthe same offer they did you! Did you think you were the only one?\" And,\nthrowing back his head, he derisively began to laugh aloud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMore than ever, Emrys hated the Morethans, not for what they would do\nto Earth's pride, but for what they had done to his. Because now there\nwas nothing that he had been offered that Dyall had not been offered\nalso. And Dyall had not accepted the Morethans' offer, thereby proving\nhimself the better man. And Dyall had tricked him, thereby proving\nhimself the cleverer man. And Dyall had hated him even more than he\nhad hated Dyall, thereby proving himself the more constant man. So\nthere Emrys Shortmire, Jan Shortmire, was left ... with nothing but a\nyouthfulness of which, he had to admit to himself, he had grown rather\ntired.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Emrys,\" Megan said. \"I'm terribly sorry.\"\n\nDyall sprang from his chair. \"I'm sick of that piping doll's voice of\nyours! I've stood it for a century, and that's long enough!\" Raising\nhis stick high in the air, he crashed it down upon the golden head,\nthe pretty pink and white face. And, frozen in horror, Emrys could\nnot move until it was too late. He had not conceived old Dyall capable\nof committing outright murder so wantonly. Probably he wasn't; to him,\nMegan was and had been always a doll.\n\nAnd now she was a heap of broken wheels and gears on the thick rug.\nStill, out of the heap of twisted machinery, a tiny, tinny voice kept\nrepeating \"I'm sorry, Emrys. I'm terribly sorry.\"\n\nExhausted by his effort, Dyall sank back into his chair. And he laughed\nas Emrys, wanting desperately to weep, unable to, bent over the pieces,\ntrying to fit them together again.\n\n\"You'll never do it, Jan,\" he croaked maliciously. \"Even a good\nengineer would never be able to repair it now. If I know how to create,\nI also know how to destroy!\" And he went into another paroxysm of\ngleefully triumphant laughter.\n\nEmrys saw that Megan was indeed far beyond his powers, and probably\nold Dyall's, to repair. Filled with fury--the one emotion, he saw now,\nthat he had not given up--he turned to smash Nicholas Dyall as Dyall\nhad smashed his doll. But the old, old man sat perfectly still in his\nchair. There was a broad grin on his face.\n\nHe made a very cheerful corpse.\n\n\nVIII\n\nEmrys Shortmire found that he did not want life any more. He went back\nto his mansion and he tried to hang himself. But the rope would not\ncut off his breath. He pointed a ray gun at his head, and although the\nheat became intolerable, it did not burn him. He swallowed poison and\nwaited. Nothing happened. He threw himself off the roof and landed\nunhurt upon the pavement below. He went back inside and slashed his\nwrist and saw the cuts close before his eyes. And as he stared at\nthe unmarked skin, thick fog filled the room, and he heard Uvrei's\nvoice--and it was the greatest ignominy of all that the Morethan's\nvoice should _dare_ to hold compassion.\n\n\"Don't you know, Emrys, that an immortal cannot die?\"\n\nWhen Emrys forced himself to look at the ancient one, he saw that\nthe beautiful eyes were filled with an unhallowed pity. \"You are an\nimmortal god, son of my spirit. You can destroy anything except one of\nus--and you are one of us now.\"\n\n\"I'm not one of you. I'm not a god, nor are you. I'm not....\" Emrys\nlooked down at his wrists, then back at Uvrei. \"But I may be immortal,\"\nhe acknowledged. \"It wasn't just a figure of speech?\"\n\n\"You will never die, Emrys. You will exist forever, like us, a handful\nof changelessness in a changing universe.\"\n\n\"Then I _won't_ be dead when you come to Earth?\" He had fancied himself\nout of it, but what exquisite punishment that not until he had tired of\nlife had he found out he was cursed with unwanted life forever. He had\nnot been a good man, but was any man evil enough to deserve this?\n\n\"When we come to Earth, you will be waiting for us. But you will look\nforward to our coming.\" And Uvrei said once again, \"You are one of us,\nEmrys.\"\n\n\"I'm not! I'm _not_!\"\n\n\"Of course you are. Like us, you do not breathe air--\"\n\n\"I do....\" And then Emrys remembered that the rope had not cut off his\nbreath, and it might well have been because he had not been breathing.\n\n\"Like us, you do not eat food.\"\n\n\"But I do!\" And here Emrys was genuinely perplexed.\n\n\"We left you your digestive system, because part of the pleasure you\ncraved comes through that. But you could completely deny yourself the\nfood that you thought sustained you and feel no ill effects--at least\nno physical ones. It's the pills that feed you, Emrys.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Emrys said slowly, \"they're food, then.\"\n\n\"Of a sort. But not the kind you mean. You cannot exist without us and\nour skills, Emrys. Each vial of pills consists of the mitogenetic force\nof ten tons of life.\"\n\n\"What kind of life?\" Emrys asked.\n\n\"Does it really matter?\"\n\n\"You said I cannot exist without you,\" Emrys pointed out shrewdly,\n\"that I need the pills. So I could stop taking them, couldn't I, and\nstarve myself to death?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUvrei smiled. \"Yes, you could do that. Only it would take, say, about\nfifteen hundred terrestrial years--perhaps, since we have given you\na strong, young body, as much as two thousand. Do you think you are\nstrong enough to starve yourself to death over a period of two thousand\nyears?\"\n\nEmrys knew he was not. In that first anguish, all he could think of\nto do was to humble himself before the Morethan. \"I have served your\npurpose. Why not be merciful to me now?\" he pleaded. \"At least let me\ndie.\"\n\n\"I could not, even if I would. So little of our old powers remain. We\nhave kept the secret of perpetual life, but we have lost the secret of\nperpetual death.\"\n\n\"But that's the greater secret!\"\n\n\"Of course it is!\" For the first time, Emrys saw the Morethan high\npriest lose control. \"Do you think I don't know what it is to crave\ndeath?\"\n\nAfter a silence, the voice, once more chillingly warm, said, \"Come,\nmy son, being one of us, you have nothing to fear from our arrival.\nYou no longer have anything in common with these animals. You cannot\neven--what is your word?--love them. When you tried, you fixed upon a\nmachine with the face of a memory.\"\n\n\"Would a human being have known she was a machine?\"\n\n\"A human being would have known.\"\n\n\"Then ... I am a machine, too? A machine created by mental, rather than\nphysical processes, but a machine nonetheless?\"\n\n\"In a sense,\" the alien said thoughtfully, \"you could be called\nthat--though to compare you, as an artistic creation, with that\ntrumpery piece of gimcrack....\"\n\n\"Don't call her that!\" Emrys shouted. \"She's dead!\"\n\nUvrei began to laugh quietly. After a little, Emrys began to laugh,\ntoo. \"I'm being foolish,\" he said.\n\n\"Extremely foolish,\" Uvrei agreed. \"Resign yourself, my son, and accept\nyour fate. That is what we immortals have all had to do, one by one.\"\n\nOf course he could do that, Emrys thought. After all, he wouldn't be as\nbadly off as the other Earth people when the Morethans came; whatever\nelse happened, he, at least, could not be turned into a component part\nof a little golden pill. Immortality was a dull future, but perhaps,\nafter the Morethans arrived, it would become more interesting.\n\n\"Good-by, son of my spirit,\" Uvrei said. \"We shall meet again\ncorporeally in a few centuries.\" The fog thickened about him and\ndisappeared, leaving its characteristic odor behind.\n\nAnd still Emrys could not resign himself. _Dyall could have had this,\ntoo, if he had wanted it. This was what he was offered and what he was\nstrong enough to refuse. If I accept my fate, then I will always know\nthat I have come off second best to him._ And this prospect, more than\nimmortality, more than the knowledge of what would happen to Earth and\nits people, was the one that Emrys found intolerable.\n\n\nIX\n\n_Why doesn't he leave me alone?_ Peter Hubbard thought, as, wearily, he\ntold the Dyall machine to let Emrys Shortmire up. _I am a very old man\nand I will die soon. Can't he leave me alone in the little time left?_\n\nBut he could not forget the obligations of courtesy. He was polite to\nEmrys Shortmire when the other man came in. Even if he hadn't been, he\nsaw, Emrys wouldn't have noticed; he was too full of his own thoughts.\n\n\"Peter,\" he cried, almost before he was fully in the room, \"did you\nknow that, in dying, Nicholas Dyall won a final victory over me?\"\n\nThe old man muffled a yawn. \"You mean you can't die? Well, I was afraid\nof that. I am sorry for you, Jan, but you brought this upon yourself.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Emrys said, looking a little disappointed that the knowledge\ndid not startle the lawyer. \"I will be alive when they come,\" he went\non, more subdued. \"I will be waiting, or so they think.\"\n\n\"I imagine that's what they counted on,\" Hubbard said indifferently.\n\"You not only giving them the secret of the engines but acting as a--an\noutpost. They didn't sell their wares cheap, did they?\"\n\nEmrys' eyes flashed copper fire. \"But I will _not_ be waiting to help\nthem. I will be waiting to _fight_ them.\"\n\n\"Brave words.\"\n\n\"You think I can't fight them?\"\n\n\"Of course you can't. They have powers far beyond yours. And why should\nyou want to fight them? I know you hadn't planned to be alive when they\ncame, but it won't be bad for you. You're one of them now.\"\n\nEmrys sat down on the couch. \"Physically I am. That's why I _can_\nfight them. Look, Peter, I have centuries ahead of me. By giving me\nimmortality, they have also given me time.\"\n\n\"Splendid. Time to do what?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Emrys confessed. \"But time is such a valuable commodity\nin itself. With it, I could learn how to turn their own powers against\nthem.\"\n\n\"Easier said than done,\" Hubbard observed.\n\n\"Maybe I could--oh--invent a machine that will amplify my mind powers\nuntil it can overcome all of theirs....\"\n\nHubbard said nothing.\n\n\"Well, then, the engines I gave them can't take them out of this galaxy\nany more than those same engines can take humanity out of it. But,\ngiven time, I can invent _new_ engines, Peter--engines that can jump\nthe gap from galaxy to galaxy. If I cannot give Man the weapons with\nwhich to fight, at least I can give him the means by which to flee!\nAnd, since I was the man who invented the one, I can be the man to\ninvent the other!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was true, Hubbard thought, hope rising in him, despite all his\nefforts to hold it back. That was possible. But would Emrys do this?\nRight now, in the first flush of repentance, he might try to. But if\nthe work grew tedious, might he not say to himself: _Why bother? I'm\nbound to live forever, anyway. Why should I care what happens to the\nothers of my kind?_\n\n\"Who knows, Peter,\" Emrys cried, \"I may be able to invent engines that\ncan move the whole world--all our worlds--to another galaxy, where the\nMorethans will never be able to follow!\"\n\n\"What's in it for you, Emrys?\" Hubbard asked bluntly.\n\n\"I want to save humanity ... and, of course,\" Emrys added, his eyes\nlighting exultantly, \"by doing that, I will do more than Dyall ever\ndid. My name will go down in history, and his--\"\n\n\"Do you hate him so much, Emrys, even though he's dead?\" Hubbard asked\nwonderingly, unable to conceive of such a thing.\n\n\"_Especially_ because he's dead,\" Emrys snarled. \"Because now I'll\nnever have the pleasure of mocking him.\" He looked anxiously at\nHubbard. \"Don't you think I'm doing the right thing, Peter?\"\n\nThe right thing, but for the wrong reason. Only for the wrong reason,\nthough, was Emrys sure to finish what he had set out to do. It was the\none motive that would keep him working long after he grew bored with\nthe work. It was humanity's only chance, and so it did not matter _why_\nEmrys was doing this.\n\n\"It's a splendid thing you're planning to do, Emrys,\" Hubbard said\nwarmly. \"A splendid thing!\"\n\nWhat if Emrys _did_ go down in history? It would be thanks to him that\nhistory had continued at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYes, he was a vicious man. And Dyall had been equally vicious. And\nPeter Hubbard was a good man--and it was he who had _not_ been granted\nthat fifty extra years of life. What was goodness? Was it inherently\nopposed to greatness? Did things get done only out of malevolent\nmotives--anger and ruthlessness and spite? If, as it seemed, goodness\nwas a passive force, and evil an active one, perhaps the world needed\nboth. And if, as it seemed, evil could beget good, then evil could not\nbe all bad.\n\n_So_, Peter Hubbard thought, _there is hope for the Morethans as well\nas for humanity._\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Never Come Midnight, by Christopher Grimm\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NEVER COME MIDNIGHT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51834-8.txt or 51834-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/3/51834/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
