It was stamped 1961, Month 13, Day 7, Horometer 3, and the\nheadlines on the front page confirmed the news of the decisive defeat\nof the American military and naval forces at the hands of the Chinese\nRepublic.\n\nA gallant fight for days against hopeless odds; failure of the army\ndynamos; airships cut off from ground guidance; battleships ripped to\npieces by the Chinese disintegrators; and, finally, the great wave of\nblack death that had wiped out two hundred thousand men.\n\nKay Bevan--to use the old-fashioned names which still persisted,\ndespite the official numerical nomenclature--glanced through the\naccount. He threw the sheet away. \"We deserved it, Cliff,\" he said.\n\nCliff nodded. \"You saw that bit about the new Chinese disintegrator?\nIf the Government had seriously considered our Crumbler--\"\n\nKay glanced at the huge, humming top that filled the center of the\nlaboratory. It spun so fast that it appeared as nothing but a\nspherical shadow, through which one could see the sparse furnishings,\nthe table, the apparatus ranged upon it, and the window over-looking\nthe upper streets of New York.\n\n\"Yes--_if!_\" he answered bitterly. \"And I'm willing to bet the Chinese\nhave an inferior machine, built upon the plans that Chinese servant\nstole from us last year.\"\n\n\"We deserved it, Cliff,\" said Kay again. \"For ten years we've harried\nand enslaved the yellow man, and taken a hundred thousand of his men\nand women to sacrifice to the Earth Giants. What would we have done,\nif conditions had been reversed?\"\n\n\"Self-preservation,\" Cliff suggested.\n\n\"Exactly. The law of the survival of the fittest. They thought that\nthey were fitter to survive. I tell you they had right on their side,\nCliff, and that's what's beaten us. Now--a hundred thousand of our\n_own_ boys and girls must be fed into the maw of these monsters every\nyear. God, suppose it were Ruth!\"\n\n\"Or you or I,\" said Cliff. \"If only we could perfect the Crumbler!\"\n\n\"What use would that be against the Earth Giants? There's nothing\norganic about them, not even bones. Pure protoplasm!\"\n\n\"We could have used it against the Chinese,\" said Cliff. \"Now--\" He\nshrugged his shoulders hopelessly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd if explorers had been content to leave the vast unknown Antarctic\nContinent alone, they would never have taught the imprisoned Giants to\ncross the great ice barrier. But that crossing had taken place fifteen\nyears ago, and already the mind of man had become accustomed to the\ngrim facts.\n\nWho could have dreamed that the supposed table-land was merely a rim\nof ice-mountains, surrounding a valley twice the size of Europe, so\nfar below sea-level that it was warmed to tropic heat by Earth's\ninterior fires? Or that this valley was peopled with what could best\nbe described as organized protoplasm?\n\nEnormous, half-transparent, gelatinous organism, attaining a height of\nabout a hundred feet, and crudely organized into forms not unlike\nthose of men?\n\nHalf the members of the Rawlins Expedition, which had first entered\nthis valley, had fallen victims to the monsters. Most of the rest had\ngone raving mad. And the stories of the two who returned, sane, to\nBuenos Aires, were discredited and scoffed at as those of madmen.\n\nBut of a second expedition none had survived, and it was the solitary\nsurvivor of the third who had confirmed the amazing story. The giant\nmonsters, actuated by some flickering human intelligence, had found\ntheir way out of the central valley, where they had subsisted by\nenfolding their vegetable and small animal prey with pseudopods, that\nit to say, temporary projections of arms from the gelatinous bulk of\ntheir substance.\n\nThey had floated across the shallow seas between the tip of the\nAntarctic Continent and Cape Horn, as toy balloons float on water.\nThen they had spread northward, extending in a wall that reached from\nthe Atlantic to the Andes. And, as they moved, they had devoured all\nvegetables and animal life in their path. Behind them lay one great\nbare, absolutely lifeless area.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow many of them were there? That was the hideous fact that had to be\nfaced. Their numbers could not be counted because, after attaining a\nheight of about a hundred feet, they reproduced by budding!\n\nAnd within a few weeks these buds, in turn, attained their full\ndevelopment.\n\nThe Argentine Government had sent a force of twenty thousand men\nagainst them, armed with cannon, machine-guns, tanks, airplanes,\npoison gas, and the new death-ray. And in the night, when it was\nbivouacking, after what it had thought was glorious victory, it had\nbeen overwhelmed _and eaten_!\n\nProof against the poison gas, the hideous monsters were, and\ninvulnerable to shot and shell. Divided and sub-divided, slashed into\nribbons, blown to fragments by bombs, each of the pieces simply became\nthe nucleus of a new organism, able, within a few hours, to assume the\noutlines of a dwarf man, and to seize and devour its prey.\n\nBut the Argentine expedition had done worse than it at first dreamed\nof. _It had given the monsters a taste for human flesh!_\n\nAfter that, the wave of devastation had obliterated life in every city\nclear up to the Amazonian forests. And then it had been discovered\nthat, by feeding these devils human flesh, they could be rendered\ntorpid and their advance stayed--so long as the periodical meals\ncontinued!\n\nAt first criminals had been supplied them, then natives, then Chinese,\nobtained by periodical war raids. What would you have? The savage\nregions of the earth had already been depopulated, and a frenzy of\nfear had taken possession of the whole world.\n\nNow the Chinese had defeated the annual American invasion, and the\nEarth Giants were budding and swarming through the heart of Brazil.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Man,\" said the Theosophists, \"is the fifth of the great root-races\nthat have inhabited this planet. The fourth were the Atlanteans. The\nthird were the Lemurians, half-human beings of whom the Australian\naborigines are the survivors. The second race was not fully organized\ninto human form. Of the first, nothing is known.\n\n\"These are the second race, surviving in the Antarctic valleys.\nHalf-human objects, groping toward that perfection of humanity of\nwhich we ourselves fall very far short. As the Kabbala says, man,\nbefore Adam, reached from heaven to earth.\"\n\nKay Bevan and Cliff Hynes had been working feverishly to perfect\ntheir Crumbler for use in the Chinese wars. Convinced, as were all\nfair-minded men, that these annual raids were unjustified, they\nyielded to the logic of the facts. Should America sacrifice a hundred\nthousand of her boys and girls each year, when human life was cheap in\nChina? _Boys and girls!_\n\nIt had been discovered that the Earth Giants required the flesh of\nwomen as well as of men. Some subtle chemical constituent then\nproduced the state of torpidity during which the advance and the\nbudding of the monsters was stayed. During the ten past years their\nnorthward advance had been almost inappreciable. Brazil had even sent\nanother army against them.\n\nBut the deadliest gases had failed to destroy the tenacious life of\nthese protoplasmic creatures, and the tanks, which had driven through\nand through them, had become entangled and blocked in the gelatinous\nexudations, and their occupants eaten.\n\nAll over the world scientists were striving to invent some way of\nremoving this menace to the world. Moreover, airplanes sent to the\npolar continent had reported fresh masses mobilizing for the advance\nnorthward. A second wave would probably burst through the Amazon\nforest barrier and sweep over the Isthmus and overrun North America.\n\nFive days after the news of the Chinese disaster was confirmed, Cliff\nHynes came back from the capital of the American Confederation,\nWashington.\n\n\"It's no use, Kay,\" he said. \"The Government won't even look at the\nCrumbler. I told them it would disintegrate every inorganic substance\nto powder, and they laughed at me. And it's true, Kay: they've given\nup the attempt to enslave China. Henceforward a hundred thousand of\nour own citizens are to be sacrificed each year. Eaten alive, Kay!\nGod, if only the Crumbler would destroy organic forms as well!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first year's quota of fifty thousand boys and fifty thousand\ngirls, thrown to the maw of the monsters to save humanity, nearly\ndisrupted the Confederation. Despite the utmost secrecy, despite the\npenalty of death for publishing news of the sacrifice, despite the\nfact that those who drew the fatal lots were snatched from their homes\nat dead of night, everything became known.\n\nOn the vast pampas in the extreme north of the Argentine Republic,\nwhere Bolivia, the Argentine, Paraguay and Brazil unite, was the place\nof sacrifice. Thousands of acres, white with the bones of those whom\nthe monsters had engulfed. Brainless, devoid of intelligence,\nsightless, because even the sense had not become differentiated in\nthem, yet by some infernal instinct the Earth Giants had become aware\nthat this was their feasting ground.\n\nBy some tacit compact, the guards who had annually brought their\nvictims to be devoured had been unmolested, the vast wall of\nsemi-human shapes withdrawing into the shelter of the surrounding\nforests while the Chinese were staked out in rows. Death, which would\nhave been a mercy, had been denied them. It was living flesh that the\nEarth Giants craved. And here, on the spot known as Golgotha, the\nhideous sacrifice had been annually repeated.\n\nThat first year, when the chosen victims were transported to the fatal\nspot, all America went mad. Frenzied parents attacked the offices of\nthe Federation in every city. The cry was raised that Spanish\nAmericans had been selected in preference to those of more northern\nblood. Civil war loomed imminent.\n\nAnd year after year these scenes must be repeated. Boys and girls,\nfrom fifteen to twenty years of age, the flower of the Federation, a\nhundred thousand of them, must die a hideous death to save humanity.\nNow the choice of the second year's victims was at hand.\n\nIn their laboratory, removed to the heart of the Adirondacks\nwilderness, Cliff and Kay were working frantically.\n\n\"It's the last chance, Kay,\" said Cliff. \"If I've not solved the\nsecret this time, it means another year's delay. The secret of\ndissolving organic forms as well as inorganic ones! What is this\nmysterious power that enables organic forms to withstand the terrific\nbombardment of the W-ray?\"\n\nThe W-ray was the Millikan cosmic ray, imprisoned and adapted for\nhuman use. It was a million times more powerful than the highest known\nvoltage of electricity. Beneath it, even the diamond, the hardest\nsubstance known, dissolved into a puff of dust; and yet the most\nfragile plant growth remained unaffected.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe laboratory in the Adirondacks was open at one end. Here, against a\nbackground of big forest trees, a curious medley of substances had\nbeen assembled: old chairs, a couple of broken-down airplanes, a large\ndisused dynamo, a heap of discarded clothing, a miscellany of kitchen\nutensils on a table, a gas stove, and a heap of metal junk of all\nkinds. The place looked, in fact, like a junk heap.\n\nThe great top was set in a socket in a heavy bar of craolite, the new\nmetal that combined the utmost tensile strength with complete\ninfusibility, even in the electric furnace. About six feet in height,\nit looked like nothing but what it was, a gyroscope in gimbals, with a\nlong and extremely narrow slit extending all around the central\nbulge, but closed on the operator's side by a sliding cover of the\nsame craolite.\n\nWithin this top, which, by its motion, generated a field of electrical\nforce between the arms of an interior magnet, the W-rays were\ngenerated in accordance with a secret formula; the speed of gyration,\nexceeding anything known on earth, multiplied their force a\nbillionfold, converting them to wave-lengths shorter than the shortest\nknown to physical science. Like all great inventions, the top was of\nthe simplest construction.\n\n\"Well,\" said Cliff, \"you'd better bring out Susie.\"\n\nKay left the laboratory and went to the cabin beside the lake that the\ntwo men occupied. From her box in front of the stove a lady porcupine\nlooked up lazily and grunted. Kay raised the porcupine; in the box, of\ncourse. Susie was constitutionally indolent, but one does not handle\nporcupines, however smooth their quills may lie.\n\nKay brought her to the heap of junk and placed the box on top of it.\nHe went inside the laboratory. \"I may as well tell you, Cliff. I\nwouldn't have brought Susie if I'd thought the experiment had the\nleast chance of success,\" he said.\n\nCliff said nothing. He was bending over the wheel, adjusting a\nmicrometer. \"All ready, Kay?\" he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKay nodded and stepped back. He swallowed hard. He hated sacrificing\nSusie to the cause of science; he almost hoped the experiment would\nfail.\n\nCliff pressed a lever, and slowly the ponderous top began to revolve\nupon its axis. Faster, faster, till it was nothing but a blur. Faster\nyet, until only its outlines were visible. Cliff pressed a lever on\nthe other side.\n\nNothing happened apparently, except for a cloudy appearance of the air\nat the open end of the laboratory. Cliff touched a foot lever. The top\nbegan to grow visible, its rotations could be seen; it ran slower,\nbegan to come to a stop.\n\nThe cloud was gone. Where the airplanes and other junk had been, was\nnothing but a heap of grayish dust. It was this that had made the\ncloud.\n\nNothing remained, except that impalpable powder against the background\nof the trees.\n\nKay caught Cliff's arm. \"Look out!\" he shouted, pointing to the heap.\n\"Something's moving in there!\"\n\nSomething was. A very angry lady porcupine was scrambling out, a\n_quillless_ porcupine, with a white skin, looking like nothing so much\nas a large, hairless rat. Cliff turned to Kay.\n\n\"We've failed,\" he said briefly. \"Too late for this year now.\"\n\n\"But--the quills?\"\n\n\"Inorganic material. But even the bones remain intact because there's\ncirculation in the marrow, you see. And the Earth Giants haven't even\nbones. They're safe--this year!\"\n\nHe flung himself down under a tree, staring up at the sky in abject\ndespair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Look, Kay, I've got my number!\" Ruth Meade smiled as she handed Kay\nthe ticket issued by the Government announcing the lottery number\nprovided for each citizen.\n\nOne hundred thousand young people between the ages of fifteen and\ntwenty would be drawn for the sacrifice, and Ruth, being nineteen, had\ncome within the limits, but this would be her last year. In a few\nweeks the Government would announce the numbers--drawn by a second\nlottery--of those who were condemned.\n\nThen, before these had been made public, the victims would already\nhave been seized and hurried to the airship depots in a hundred\nplaces, for conveyance to the hideous Golgotha of the pampas.\n\nThe chance that any individual would be among the fated ones was\nreasonably small. It was the fashion to make a jest of the whole\nbusiness. Ruth smiled as she showed her ticket.\n\nKay stared at it. \"Ruth, if--if anything happened to you I'd go\ninsane. I'd--\"\n\n\"Why this sudden ardor, Kay?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKay took Ruth's small hand in his. \"Ruth, you mustn't play with me any\nmore. You know I love you. And the sight of that thing makes me almost\ninsane. You do care, don't you?\" And, as Ruth remained silent, \"Ruth,\nit isn't Cliff Hymes, is it? I know you two are old friends. I'd\nrather it were Cliff than anybody else, if it had to be some one,\nbut--tell me, Ruth!\"\n\n\"It isn't Cliff,\" said Ruth slowly.\n\n\"Is it--some one else?\"\n\n\"It's you, dear,\" answered Ruth. \"It's always been you. It might have\nbeen Cliff if you hadn't come along. But he knows now it can never be\nhe.\"\n\n\"Does he know it's me?\" asked Kay, greatly relieved.\n\nRuth inclined her head. \"He took it very finely,\" she said. \"He said\njust what you've said about him. Oh, Kay, if only your experiment had\nsucceeded, and the world could be free of this nightmare! What\nhappened? Why couldn't you and Cliff make it destroy life?\"\n\n\"I don't know, dear,\" answered Kay. \"Iron and steel melt into powder\nat the least impact of the rays. They are so powerful that there was\neven a leakage through the rubber and anelektron container. Even the\ncraolite socket was partly fused, and that is supposed to be an\nimpossibility. And there was a hole in the ground seven feet deep\nwhere the very mineral water in the earth had been dissolved. But\nagainst organic substances the W-ray is powerless.\n\n\"Next year, dear--next year we'll have solved our problem, and then\nwe'll free the world of this menace, this nightmare. Ruth--don't let's\ntalk about that now. I love you!\"\n\nThey kissed. The Earth Giants faded out of their consciousness even\nwhile Ruth held that ominous ticket in her hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKay said nothing to Cliff about it, but Cliff knew. Perhaps he had put\nhis fate to the test with Ruth and learned the truth from her. Ruth\nmade no reference to the matter when she saw Kay. But between the two\nmen, friends for years, a coolness was inexorably developing.\n\nThey had gone to work on the new machine. They were hopeful. When they\nwere working, they forgot their rivalry.\n\n\"You see, Kay,\" said Cliff, \"we mustn't forget that the Millikan rays\nhave been bombarding Earth since Earth became a planet, out of the\ndepths of space. It is their very nature not to injure organic life,\notherwise all life on Earth would have been destroyed long ago. Now,\nour process is only an adaptation of these cosmic rays. We haven't\nchanged their nature.\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Kay. \"What we want is a death-ray strong enough to\nobliterate these monsters, without simply disintegrating them and\ncreating new fragments to bud into the complete being. Why do you\nsuppose they are so tenacious of life, Cliff?\"\n\n\"They represent primeval man, life itself, striving to organize\nitself, and nothing is more tenacious than the life principle,\"\nanswered Cliff.\n\nMeanwhile the fatal weeks were passing. A few days after the tickets\nhad been distributed, a Government notice was broadcasted and\npublished, ordaining that, in view of former dissensions, no\nsubstitutes for the condemned persons would be permitted. Rich or\npoor, each of the victims chosen by lot must meet his fate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the monsters were growing active. There had been an extension of\ntheir activities. Tongues had been creeping up the rivers that ran\ninto the Amazon. Suddenly a dense mass of the devils had appeared on\nthe north coast, near Georgetown. They had overleaped the Amazon; they\nwere overrunning British Guiana, eating up everything on their way.\nGeorgetown was abandoned; the monsters were in complete control.\n\n\"They will be cut off from the main herd,\" the optimistic reports\nannounced. \"We shall deal with the main herd first. This year the\nsacrifice will have to be made, but it will be the last. Scientists\nhave at last hit upon an infallible toxin which will utterly destroy\nthis menace within a few months.\"\n\nNobody believed that story, for everything had been tried and failed.\nIn their laboratory Cliff and Kay were working frantically. And now\nthe coldness that had developed between them was affecting their\ncollaboration too. Cliff was keeping something back from Kay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKay knew it. Cliff had made some discovery that he was not sharing\nwith his partner. Often Kay, entering the laboratory, would find Cliff\nfurtively attempting to conceal some operation that he was in the\nmidst of. Kay said nothing, but a brooding anger began to fill his\nheart. So Cliff was trying to get all the credit for the result of\ntheir years of work together!\n\nAnd always, in the back of his mind, there was a vision of the little\nGovernment ticket in Ruth's hand, with the numbers in staring black\ntype. They had burned into his brain. He could never forget them.\nOften at night, after a hard day's work, he would suddenly awaken out\nof a hideous nightmare, in which he saw Ruth taken away by the agents\nof the Government, to be thrown as a sacrifice to the monsters.\n\nAnd Cliff was hiding something! That made the situation unbearable.\n\nThe coolness between the two men was rapidly changing into open\nanimosity. And then one day, quite by chance, in Cliff's absence, Kay\ncame upon evidence of Cliff's activities.\n\nCliff was no longer experimenting with the W-ray! He was using a new\ntype of ray altogether, the next series, the psenium electron\nemanation discovered only a few years before, which had the peculiar\nproperty of non-alternation, even when the psenium electron changed\nits orbit around the central nucleus of the psenium atom.\n\nInstead of discontinuity, the psenium electron had been found to emit\nradiation steadily, and this had upset the classic theories of matter\nfor the ninth time in the past fifteen years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Kay's wrath broke loose in a storm of reproaches when Cliff came\ninto the laboratory.\n\n\"You've been deliberately keeping me in the dark!\" he shouted. \"You're\na nice sort of partner to have! Here's where we split up the\ncombination, Hynes!\"\n\n\"I've been thinking that for a long time,\" sneered Cliff. \"The fact\nis, Kay, you're a little too elementary in your ideas to suit me. It's\ndue to you that I kept hammering away on the wrong tack for years. The\nsooner we part, the better.\"\n\n\"No time like now,\" said Kay. \"Keep your laboratory. You put most of\nthe money into it, anyway. I'll build me another--where I can work\nwithout being hampered by a partner who's out for himself all the\ntime. Good luck to you in your researches, and I hope you'll get all\nthe credit when you find a way of annihilating the Earth Giants.\"\n\nAnd he stormed out of the laboratory, jumped into his plane, and\nwinged his way southward toward his apartment in New York.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrowds in the streets of every town on the way. In villages and\nhamlets, swarming like ants, and hurrying along the highways! Kay, who\nflew one of the slow, old-fashioned planes, averaging little more than\na hundred miles an hour, winged his way methodically overhead, too\nmuch absorbed in his anger against Cliff to pay much attention to this\nphenomenon at first. But gradually it was borne in upon him that\nsomething was wrong.\n\nHe flew lower, and now he was passing over a substantial town, and he\ncould hear the shouts of anger that came up to him. The whole town was\nin a ferment, gathered in the town square.\n\nSuddenly the reason came home to Kay. He saw the adjoining airport,\nand dropped like a plummet, hovering down until his wheels touched the\nground. Without waiting to taxi into one of the public hangars, he\nleaped out and ran through the deserted grounds into the square.\n\nGroans, yells, shrieks of derision rent the air. The whole crowd had\ngone maniacal. And it was as Kay had thought. Upon a white background\nhigh up on the town ball building, the numbers of the local boys and\ngirls who had been picked for sacrifices were being shown.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEight boys and fifteen girls, already on their way into the wastes of\nSouth America, to meet a hideous death.\n\n\"They took my Sally,\" screamed a wizened woman, the tears raining down\nher checks. \"Kidnapped her at the street corner after dark. I didn't\nknow why she hadn't come home last night. God, my Sally, my little\ngirl, gone--gone--\"\n\n\"People, you must be patient,\" boomed the Government announcer. \"The\nPresident feels with you in your affliction. But by next year a means\nwill have been devised of destroying these monsters. Your children\nwill have their sacrifice recorded in the Hall of Fame. They are true\nsoldiers who--\"\n\n\"To hell with the Government!\" roared a man. \"Stop that damn talk\nmachine! Break her, fellows! Then we'll hang President Bogart from the\ntop of the Capitol!\"\n\nYells answered him, and the crowd surged forward toward the building.\n\n\"Stand back!\" shrieked the announcer. \"It's death to set foot on the\nstep. We are now electrified. Last warning!\"\n\nThe first ranks of the mob recoiled as a charge of electricity at a\nvoltage just short of that required to take life coursed through their\nbodies. Shrieks of agony rang out. Files of writhing forms covered the\nground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKay rushed to the automatic clerk at the window beside the metal\nsteps, taking care to avoid contact with them. Within six feet, the\ntemperature of his body brought the thermostatic control into action;\nthe window slid upward and the dummy appeared. He turned the dial to\nAlbany.\n\n\"I want New York Division, Sub-station F, Loyalist Registration,\" he\ncalled. \"Give me Z numbers of the lottery, please.\"\n\n\"No numbers will be given out until Horometer 13,\" the dummy boomed.\n\n\"But I tell you I must know immediately!\" Kay pleaded frantically.\n\n\"Stand away, please!\"\n\n\"I've got to know, I tell you!\"\n\n\"We are now electrified. Last warning!\"\n\n\"Listen to me. My name's Kay Bevan. I--\"\n\nA mighty buffet in the chest hurled Kay ten feet backward upon the\nground. He rose, came within the electric zone, felt his arms twisted\nin a giant's grasp, staggered back again and sat down gasping. The\nwindow went down noiselessly, the dummy swung back into place. Kay got\nupon his feet again, choking with impotent rage.\n\nAll about him men and women were milling in a frantic mob. He broke\nthrough them, went back to where his plane was standing. A minute\nlater he was driving madly toward the district airport in New York\nwithin three blocks of Ruth's apartment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe dropped into a vacant landing place, checked hastily, and rushed\ninto the elevator. Once in the upper street, he bounded to the middle\nplatform, and, not satisfied to let it convey him at eight miles an\nhour, strode on through the indignant throng until he reached his\ndestination. Hurling the crowds right and left he gained the exit,\nand a half-minute later was on the upper level of the apartment block.\n\nHe pushed past the janitor and raced along the corridor to Ruth's\napartment. She would be in if all was well; she worked for the\nBroadcast Association, correcting the proofs that came from the\ndistrict headquarters by pneumatic tube. He stopped outside the door.\nThe little dial of white light showed him that the apartment was\nunoccupied.\n\nAs he stood there in a daze, hoping against hope, he saw a thread\nhanging from the crevice between door and frame. He pulled at it, and\ndrew out a tiny strip of scandium, the new compressible metal that had\nbecome fashionable for engagement rings. Plastic, all but invisible,\nit could be compressed to the thickness of a sheet of paper: it was\nthe token of secret lovers, and Kay had given Ruth a ring of it.\n\nIt was the signal, the dreaded signal that Ruth had been on the\nlottery list--the only signal that she had been able to convey, since\nstringent precautions were taken to prevent the victims becoming known\nuntil all possibility of rescue was removed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo chance of rescuing her! From a hundred airports the great\nGovernment airships had long since sailed into the skies, carrying\nthose selected by the wheel at Washington for sacrifice to the Earth\nGiants. Only one chance remained. If Cliff had discovered the secret\nthat had so long eluded them, surely he would reveal it to him now!\n\nTheir quarrel was forgotten. Kay only knew that the woman he loved was\neven then speeding southward to be thrown to the maw of the vile\nmonsters that held the world in terror. Surely Cliff would bend every\neffort to save her!\n\nOnly a few hours had passed since Kay had stormed out of the\nlaboratory in the Adirondacks in a rage when he was back on their\nlittle private landing field. He leaped from the plane and ran up the\ntrail beside the lake between the trees. The cabin was dark; and, when\nKay reached the laboratory he found it dark too.\n\n\"Cliff! Cliff!\" he shouted.\n\nNo answer came, and with a sinking heart he snapped the button at the\ndoor. It failed to throw the expected flood of light through the\ninterior. With shaking hand Kay pulled the little electron torch from\nhis pocket, and its bright beam showed that the door was padlocked. He\nmoved round to the window. The glass was unbreakable, but the ray from\nthe torch showed that the interior of the laboratory had been\ndismantled, and the great top was gone.\n\nIn those few hours Cliff, for reasons best known to himself, had\nremoved the top, Kay's one hope of saving Ruth. And he was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn that moment Kay went insane. He raved and cursed, calling down\nvengeance upon Cliff's head. Cliff's very motive was incredible. That\nhe had deliberately removed the top in order that Ruth should die was\nnot, of course, conceivable. But in that first outburst of fury Kay\ndid not consider that.\n\nPresently Kay's madness burned itself out. There was still one thing\nthat he could do. His plane, slow though it was, would carry him to\nthe pampas. He could get fresh fuel at numerous bootleg petrol\nstations, even though the regulations against intersectional flight\nwere rigid. With luck he could reach the pampas, perhaps before the\nsluggish monsters had fallen upon their prey. It was said that the\nvictims sometimes waited for days!\n\nSomething was rubbing against his leg, pricking it through his\nanklets. Kay looked down. A lady porcupine, with tiny new quills, was\nshowing recognition, even affection, if such a spiny beast could be\nsaid to possess that quality.\n\nSomehow the presence of the beast restored Kay's mind to normal.\n\n\"Well, he's left us both in the lurch, Susie,\" he said. \"Good luck to\nyou, beastie, and may you find a secure hiding place until your quills\nhave grown.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrowning men catch at straws. Kay snatched out his watch, and the\nilluminated dial showed that it was already two quintets past\nhorometer 13. He darted back to the cabin. The door was unfastened,\nand his torch showed him that, though Cliff had evidently departed,\nand taken his things, the interior was much as it had been. When Kay\npicked up the telephotophone, the oblong dial flashed out. The\ninstrument was in working order.\n\nHe turned the crank, and swiftly a succession of scenes flashed over\nthe dial. On this little patch of glassite, Kay was actually making\nthe spatial journey to Albany, each minutest movement of the crank\nrepresenting a distance covered. The building of the New York Division\nappeared, and its appearance signified that Kay was telephonically\nconnected. But there was no automatic voice attachment, an expense\nthat Kay and Cliff had decided would be unjustified. He had to rely\nupon the old-fashioned telephone, such as was still widely in use in\nrural districts. He took up the receiver.\n\n\"Sub-Station F, Loyalist Registration, please,\" he called.\n\n\"Speaking,\" said a girl's voice presently.\n\n\"I want the Z numbers. All from Z5 to ZA,\" said Kay.\n\nAnd thus, in the dark hut, he listened to the doom pronounced, miles\naway, by a more or less indifferent operator. When the fatal number\nwas read out, he thanked her and hung up. He released the crank, which\nmoved back to its position, putting out the light on the dial.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment or two he stood there motionless, in a sort of daze,\nthough actually he was gathering all his reserves of resolution for\nthe task confronting him. Simply to find Ruth among the hundred\nthousand victims, and die with her. A task stupendous in itself, and\nyet Kay had no doubt that he would succeed, that he would be holding\nher in his arms when the tide of hell flowed over them.\n\nHe knew the manner of that death. The irresistible onset of the giant\nmasses of protoplasm, the extrusion of temporary arms, or feelers,\nthat would grasp them, drag them into the heart of the yielding\nsubstance, and slowly smother them to death while the life was drained\nfrom their bodies. It had been said the death was painless, but that\nwas Government propaganda. But he would be holding Ruth in his arms.\nHe'd find her: he had no doubt of that at all.\n\nAnd, strangely enough, now that Kay knew the worst, now that not the\nslightest doubt remained, he was conscious of an elevation of spirits,\na sort of mad recklessness that was perfectly indefinable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKay turned his torch into a corner of the kitchen. Yes, there was the\nthing subconsciousness had prompted him to seek. A long-shafted, heavy\nwoodsman's ax, a formidable weapon at close quarters. Because it is\nthe instinct of _homo Americanus_ to die with a weapon in his hands,\nrather than let himself be butchered helplessly, Kay snatched it up.\nHe ran back to his plane. The gas tank was nearly empty, but there was\npetrol in the ice house beside the lake.\n\nKay wheeled the machine up to it, and filled up with gas and oil. All\nready now! He leaped in, pressed the starter, soared vertically,\nhelicopter wings fluttering like a soaring hawk's. Up to the passenger\nair lane at nine thousand: higher to twelve, the track of the\ninternational and supply ships; higher still, to the fourteen thousand\nceiling of the antiquated machine. He banked, turned southward.\n\nIt was freezing cold up there, and Kay had no flying suit on him,\nbut, between the passenger lane and the lane of the heliospheres, at\nthirty thousand, there was no air police. And he could afford to take\nno chances. The Government police would be on the lookout for a score\nsuch desperate men as he, bent on a similar mission. He drove the\nplane toward the Atlantic till a red glow began to diffuse itself\nbeneath him, an area of conflagration covering square miles of\nterritory.\n\nSwooping lower, Kay could hear the sound of detonations, the roar of\nold-fashioned guns, while through the pall of lurid smoke came the\nlong, violet flashes of atomic guns, cleaving lanes of devastation.\nNew York was burning.\n\nThe frenzied populace had broken into revolt, seized the guns stored\nin the arsenals, and attacked the great Bronx fortress that stood like\na mighty sentinel to protect the port.\n\nA swarm of airships came into view, swirling in savage fight. Kay\nzoomed. It was not his battle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow New York lay behind him, and he was winging southward over the\nAtlantic. All night he flew. At dawn he came down in a coast hamlet\nfor bootleg petrol and oil.\n\n\"You come from New York?\" asked the Georgian. \"Hear there's war broke\nout up there.\"\n\n\"My war's down in Brazil,\" muttered Kay.\n\n\"Say, if them Giants comes up here yuh know what us folks is going to\ndo? We're going to set the hounds on 'em. Yes, sirree, we've got a\npack of bloodhounds, raised for jest that purpose. I guess that's\nsomething them wisecrackers at Washington ain't thought of. They took\ntwo little fellers from Hopetown, but they won't take nobody from\nhere.\"\n\nKay fuelled up and resumed his flight southward.\n\nAfter that it was a nightmare. The sun rose and set, alternating with\nthe staring moon and stars. Kay crossed the Caribbean, sighted the\nSouth American coast, swept southward over the jungles of Brazil. He\ndrank, but no food passed his lips. He had become a mechanism, set for\non special purpose--self-immolation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was in a wide savannah among the jungles that he first caught sight\nof the monsters. At first he thought it was the rising dawn mist; then\nhe began to distinguish a certain horrible resemblance to human forms,\nand swooped down, banking round and round the opening in the jungle\nuntil he could see clearly.\n\nThere were perhaps a score of them, an advance guard that had pushed\nforward from one of the main divisions. Men? Anthropoids, rather, for\ntheir sex was indistinguishable! Human forms ranging from a few feet\nto a hundred, composed apparently of a grayish jelly, propelling\nthemselves clumsily on two feet, but floating rather than walking.\nTranslucent, semi-transparent. Most horrible of all, these shadowy,\nspheroid creatures exhibited here and there buds of various sizes,\nwhich were taking on the similitude of fresh forms. And among them\nwere the young, the buds that had fallen from the parent stems, fully\nformed humans of perhaps five or six feet, bouncing with a horrible\nplayfulness among their sires.\n\nAs Kay soared some three hundred feet overhead, a young tapir came\nleaping out of the jungle and ran, apparently unconscious of their\npresence, right toward the monsters. Suddenly it stopped, and Kay saw\nthat it was already encircled by coils of protoplasm, resembling arms,\nwhich had shot forth from the bodies of the devils.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwiftly, despite its struggles and bleatings, the tapir was drawn into\nthe substance of the monsters, which seemed to fuse together and form\na solid wall of protoplasm in all respects like the agglutination of\nbacteria under certain conditions.\n\nThen the beast vanished in the wall, whose agitated churnings alone\ngave proof of its existence.\n\nFor perhaps ten minutes longer Kay remained hovering above the\nclearing. Then the bodies divided, resuming their separate shapes. And\nthe white bones of the tapir lay in a huddled mass in the open.\n\nKay went mad. Deliberately he set down his plane, and, hatchet in\nhand, advanced upon the sluggish monsters. Shouting wildly, he leaped\ninto their midst.\n\nThe fight that followed was like a nightmare fight. He lopped off the\nslow tentacles that sought to envelop him, he slashed the devils into\nlong ribbons of writhing jelly, slashed until the substance blunted\nthe ax; wiped it clean and leaped into their midst again, hewing until\nhe could no longer raise his arm. Then he drew back and surveyed the\nscene before him.\n\nIt was dreadful enough to drive the last remnants of sanity from his\nbrain. For every piece that he had cut from the monsters, every\nprotoplasmic ribbon was reorganizing before his eyes into the\nsemblance of a new creature. Where there had been a score, there were\nnow five hundred!\n\nKay ran back to his plane, leaped in, and soared southward. His face\nwas a grotesque mask of madness, and his cries rang out through the\nether.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe victims were no longer chained to stakes. The Federation, which\nalways acted with complete secrecy, had gone one better. It had\nengaged electrical engineers, kept them housed in secret places,\ntransported them to Golgotha; and there a vast electrified field had\nbeen established, an open space whose boundaries were marked out by\npillars of electron steel.\n\nBetween these pillars ran lines of electric force. To attempt to pass\nthem meant--not death, for dead boys and girls were spurned by the\ndevils--but a violent shock that hurled one backward.\n\nOn this great plain the hundred thousand victims sat huddled in the\nopen. Food they had none, for no purpose was to be served by\nmitigating their last agonies. No shelter either, for the sight of\nbuildings might delay the final phase. But high above the doomed there\nfloated the flag of the Federation, on a lofty pole, a touch of ironic\nsentimentality that had commended itself to some mind at Washington.\n\nOver a square mile of territory, ringed with jungle the victims lay.\nThe majority of them ringed this terrain; that is to say, attempting\nto escape, they had been hurled back by the electrical charge, and,\nhaving no strength or will remaining, they had dropped where they had\nbeen hurled, and lay in apathetic resignation.\n\nThere had been screams and cries for mercy, and piteous scenes when\nthe Government airships had deposited them there and flown away, but\nnow an intense silence had descended upon the doomed. Resigned to\ntheir fate, they sat or lay in little silent groups, all eyes turned\ntoward the gloomy jungle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd everywhere within this jungle a wraith-like mist was forming at\nthis dawn hour. From a thousand miles around, the devils were\nmustering for their prey, agglutinating, in order that the meal of one\nmight become the meal of all.\n\nWisps of protoplasmic fog were stealing out through the trees,\nchanging shape every instant, but always advancing: now presenting the\nappearance of an aligned regiment of huge, shadowy men, now nothing\nbut a wall of semi-solid vapor. And still, with eyeballs straining in\ntheir sockets, the victims watched.\n\nSuddenly all were seized with the same spasm of mad terror. Again they\nhurled themselves against the electrified lines, and again they were\nhurled back, masses of boys and girls tumbling against one another,\nand screaming in one wail that, could it have been heard in\nWashington, would have driven all insane. Again and again, till they\nfell back, panting and helpless. And solidly the wall of devils was\ncreeping up from every side.\n\nRuth Deane, one of the few who had themselves in control, lay some\ndistance back from the electrified field. From the moment when she was\nsurprised in her apartment by the Government representatives, she had\nknown that there was no hope of escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had slipped the ring off her finger, snapped the plastic metal,\nand attached it to a thread torn from her dress. She had managed to\ninsert it in the door, hoping that Kay would find it. It would serve\nas a last message of love to him.\n\nEvery removal of a selected victim was in the nature of a kidnapping.\nAt dead of night her apartment had been opened. She had been ordered\nto dress. Nothing could be written, no arrangements made. She was\nalready considered as one dead.\n\nShe had been hurried out of the upper entrance to the monorail, which\nconveyed her in a special car to the landing station. A few minutes\nlater she had been on her way to join the camp of other victims, a\nhundred miles away. Within two hours she was on her way southward.\n\nStunned by the tragedy, none of the victims had made much of an\noutcry. They had been given water by the airship police. No food for\nboys and girls already dead. Days and nights had passed, and now she\nwas here, faint from exhaustion, and wondering at the despair shown by\nthose others. What difference would it make in half an hour? Besides,\nthat Government pamphlet had insisted that this death was painless!\n\nBut an immense longing to see Kay once more came over her. There had\nbeen a time when she thought she loved Cliff; then Kay had come into\nher life, and she had known that other affair was folly. She had\nnever told Kay of the bitter scene between Cliff and herself, how he\nhad raved against Kay and sworn to win her in the end.\n\nCliff had calmed down and apologized, and Ruth had never seen him\nagain. She wished he had not taken it like that. But above all she\nwanted to see Kay, just to say good-by.\n\nAnd she tried to send out her whole heart to him in an unspoken\nmessage of love that would surely somehow convey itself to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wall of devils was creeping up on every side, slowly,\nlethargically. The monsters took their time, because they knew they\nwere invincible. The sobs and shrieks had died away. Collected into a\nmass almost as rigid as that of the Earth Giants, the victims waited,\npalsied as a rabbit that awaits the approach of the serpent.\n\nA humming overhead. An airplane shooting down from the sky. Rescue?\nNo. Only a solitary pilot, armed with a woodsman's ax.\n\nKay drifted down, touched ground, leaped to his feet. Chance had\nbrought him within five hundred yards of where Ruth was standing. But\nRuth had known who that lone flyer must be. She broke through the\nthrong; she rushed to meet him. Her arms were around him.\n\n\"Kay, darling Kay!\"\n\n\"Ruth, dearest!\"\n\n\"I knew you'd come.\"\n\n\"I've come to die beside you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was perhaps odd that it did not enter the head of either as a\npossibility that Kay should simply place Ruth in the plane and fly\naway with here to safety. Had the thought occurred to Kay, he might\nhave been tempted. But such black treachery was something\ninconceivable by either. So long as the Federation remained, so long\nas man moved in an organized society, he was bound to his fellows, to\nfight, suffer, and die with them.\n\n\"Stand by me, Ruth. We're going down fighting.\"\n\nThey moved back toward the throng, which, momentarily stirred to hope\nby Kay's appearance, had fallen into the former apathy of despair. And\nnow the monsters were beginning to enter the electrified zone at one\npoint. As they passed the line of posts, the high tension current made\ntheir bodies luminous, but it had no appreciable effect upon them.\nThey moved on, inevitably.\n\nA score or so of semi-human forms, agglutinated into a mass, and yet\nindividually discernible. They bore down slowly upon the crowd of\nvictims, who pressed backward as they advanced. On the other sides,\nthough they almost encircled the field of death, the monsters were\nmaking no maneuvers to entrap their prey. Their sluggish minds were\nincapable of conceiving anything of the kind. But for the electrified\nzone, the great majority of the victims could have effected their\nescape. The monsters were simply pressing forward to their meal; they\ndid not interpret its capture in terms of strategy at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA new frenzy of horror seized the crowd. They fled, struggling back\nuntil the foremost in flight reached the other side of Golgotha, to be\nrepulsed by the electrified zone there. They fell in tumbled heaps.\nAppalling shrieks rang through the air.\n\nAnother line of the monsters was seeping forward, converging toward\nthe first. As the two lines met, they coalesced into a wall of\nprotoplasm, a thousand feet in length by a hundred high. A wall out of\nwhich leered phantasmal faces, like those in a frieze.\n\nKay stood alone, his arm around Ruth. To follow the flying mob would\nbut prolong the agony. He raised the ax. He looked into the girl's\neyes. She understood, and nodded.\n\nOne last embrace, one kiss, and Kay placed her behind him. He sprang\nforward, shouting, and plunged into the very heart of the wall.\n\nAnd Ruth, watching with eyes dilated with horror, saw it yield with a\nsucking sound, and saw Kay disappear within it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe saw the hideous mass fold itself upon him, and a hundred extruded\ntentacles wave in the air as they blindly grappled for him. And then\nKay had broken through, and was hewing madly with great sweeps of the\nax that slashed great streamers of the amorphous tissue from the wall\nof protoplasm.\n\nIt recoiled and then folded once more, and Kay's mighty sweeps were\nslashing phantom limbs from phantom bodies; and lopping off tentacles\nthat curled and coiled, and put forth caricatures of hands and\nfingers, and then, uniting with other slashed off tentacles, began to\nmould themselves into the likeness of dwarf monsters. Kay's struggle\nwas like that of a man fighting a fog, for again and again he broke\nthrough the wall, and always it reunited.\n\nAnd behind it another wall of protoplasm was pressing forward, and on\nanother side a wall was drifting up. As Kay stopped, panting, and\nmomentarily free, Ruth saw that they were almost encircled.\n\nShe saw the nature of that fight. Inevitably that wall would close\nabout them; and, though the bones of last year's victims had been\ngathered up and carried away by the Federation, she guessed what would\noccur.\n\nShe ran to Kay and dragged him back through the closing gap. It met\nbehind them, and again they stood face to face with the devils. Only\nthis time, instead of a wall of protoplasm, it was a veritable\nmountain that confronted them, and there could be no more breaking\nthrough.\n\nKay thought afterward that the one touch of absolute horror was that\nthe reforming monsters, the young ones growing visibly before his\neyes, had the gamboling instinct of young lambs or other creatures.\nThey were much more lively than the parent creatures.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy this time perhaps a third of the space within the electrified lines\nhad been occupied by the devils. The wall was slowly and sluggishly\nadvancing, and a fresh infiltration was drifting in on another side.\nAs the victims were pressed closer and closer together in their\nflight, half of them seemed to go insane. They raced to and fro,\nlaughing and screaming, flinging their arms aloft in extravagant\ngestures. One young fellow, rushing across the ground, hurled himself\nlike a bolt from a catapult into the heart of the grisly mass, which\nopened and received him.\n\nThere was a struggle, a convulsion; then the mass moved on.\n\nKay wiped his ax. He stood beside Ruth, gathering strength and breath\nto fight again. What else was there to do?\n\nSuddenly a humming sound came to his ears. Still some little distance\nfrom the monsters, he glanced back. The victims were shouting, staring\nupward. Over the tops of the jungle trees Kay saw a second airplane\nflying toward them, a larger one than the plane which he had flown.\n\nIt opened its helicopter wings and drifted downward. Kay saw a single\npilot, and, in the baggage compartment something that at first he did\nnot recognize. Then he recognized both this object and the aviator.\n\n\"It's Cliff,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"He's brought the top!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe crowd was milling about Cliff as he stepped out of the plane. Kay\nbroke through their midst, shouting to them to clear a space, that it\nwas their chance, their only chance. They heard him and obeyed. And\nCliff and Kay clasped hands, and there was Ruth beside them.\n\nThe two men carried the top out of the baggage compartment and set it\nup.\n\n\"Thank God I came in time,\" Cliff hissed. \"How long have we got, Kay?\"\n\n\"Five minutes, I think,\" Kay answered, glancing at the oncoming wall.\n\"They're slow. Will it work, Cliff? God, when I found you'd gone last\nnight--\"\n\nCliff did not answer. Ignoring Kay's offer of assistance, he fitted\nthe top tightly into its socket of craolite, much heavier than the\nformer one. Beneath this, three heavy craolite legs formed a sort of\ntripod.\n\n\"I looked forward to this possibility, Kay,\" said Cliff, as he\nadjusted the top and turned the clamps that held it in position.\n\"Sorry I had to deceive you, but you we're so set on the cosmic rays,\nand I knew the psenium emanations wouldn't appeal to you. You wouldn't\nhave believed. I had a hunch Ruth would draw one of those numbers....\n_How long?_\"\n\nThe swaying masses of gray jelly were very near them. Cliff worked\nfeverishly at the top.\n\n\"Let me help. Cliff!\"\n\n\"No! I'm through! Stand back!\" shouted Cliff.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven then--he regretted it afterward, and knew that he would regret it\nto his dying day--even then the thought flashed through Kay's mind\nthat Cliff wanted all the glory. Behind him the milling, screaming\ncrowd was huddling, as if for protection. Slowly a wisp-like tentacle\nprotruded from the advancing wall. Kay swung his ax and lopped it from\nthe phantom body. But the wall was almost upon them, and from the\nother side it was advancing rapidly.\n\n\"I'm ready! Stand back!\" Cliff turned upon Kay, his face white, his\nvoice hoarse. \"I've one request to make, Kay. Keep everybody back,\nincluding you and Ruth. Nobody is to come within twenty-five yards of\nthis machine!\"\n\n\"That shall be done,\" said Kay, a little bitterness in his tone.\n\n\"Ruth, I think I'm going to save you all.\" Cliff looked into the\ngirl's face for a moment. \"Please stand back twenty-five yards,\" he\nrepeated.\n\nKay took Ruth by the arm and drew her back. The crowd moved back,\ntheir pressure moving back the vast multitudes behind them. The vast\nmob was almost packed into the quarter of the Golgotha; there was\nscarcely room to move.\n\nKay saw Cliff press the lever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly the giant top began to whirl. Faster ... faster.... Now it was\nrevolving so fast that it had become totally invisible. But Cliff was\nalmost surrounded by the wall of jelly. Only his back could be seen,\nand then space was narrowing fast.\n\nKay gripped Ruth's arm tightly. He held his breath. The crowd, of whom\nonly a small part knew what was taking place, was screaming with\nterror as the mass of jelly on the other side pressed them inexorably\nbackward. And Cliff had almost vanished. Would the machine work? Was\nit possible that the psenium emanations would succeed where the\nMillikan rays, the W-ray had failed?\n\nThen of a sudden the air grew dark as night. Kay began to sneeze. He\ngasped for air. He was choking. He could see nothing, and he strained\nRuth to him convulsively, while the terrified multitudes behind him\nset up a last wail of despair.\n\nHe could see nothing, and he stood with the ax ready for the onset of\nthe monsters, more terrible now, in their invisibility, than before.\nThen of a sudden there sounded subterranean rumblings. The ground\nseemed to open almost under Kay's feet.\n\nHe leaped back, dragging Ruth with him. Slowly the dust was settling,\nthe darkness lessening. A faint, luminous glow overhead revealed the\nsun. Kay was aware that Cliff had swung the top, so that the psenium\nrays were being brought to bear upon the second mass of the monsters\non the other side.\n\nThe sun vanished in appalling blackness. Again the dust-choked air was\nalmost unbreathable. The shrieks of the crowd died away in wheezing\ngasps; and then a wilder clamor began.\n\n\"The earthquake! The earthquake!\" a girl was shrilling. \"God help us\nall!\"\n\nKay stood still, clutching Ruth tightly in his arms. He dared not\nstir, for all the world seemed to be dissolving into chaos.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly the dust began to settle again. Perhaps five minutes passed\nbefore the sunbeams began to struggle through. A cloud of grey dust\nstill obscured everything. But the wall of protoplasm was gone!\n\nCliff's voice came moaning out of the murk, calling Kay's name.\n\nKay moved forward cautiously, still holding Ruth. He seemed to be\nskirting the edge of a vast crater. At the edge of it he found the\ntop, revolving slowly. And Cliff's voice came from beside the top.\n\n\"Kay, we've won. Don't look at me. Don't let Ruth see me! Look down!\"\n\nKay looked down into the bottomless pit, extending clear across the\nplain to the distant jungle. An enormous canyon cloven in the earth,\nfilled with the slowly settling cloud of dust.\n\n\"They're there, Kay. Don't look this way!\"\n\nBut Kay looked--and could see nothing except a pile of debris, from\nthe bottom of which Cliff's voice issued.\n\n\"Cliff, you're not hurt?\"\n\n\"A--a little. You must listen while I tell you how to clean up the\nmonsters. It's the psenium emanation. It has the same effect when our\nmethod is applied to it. It disintegrates everything inorganic--not\norganic.\n\n\"I thought, if I couldn't get them, I'd crumble the earth away--bury\nthem. They're underneath the debris, Kay, a mile deep, buried, beneath\nthe impalpable powder that represented the inorganic salts and\nminerals of the earth. They'll never get out of that. Protoplasm needs\noxygen. They'll trouble us no more.\n\n\"You must take the top, Kay. Use our old method. You'll find its\napplication to the psenium emanation written in a book fastened\nbeneath the hood. Wipe out the rest of them. If any more come, you'll\nknow how to deal with them.\"\n\n\"Cliff, you're not badly hurt?\" Kay asked again.\n\n\"Don't look, I tell you! Keep Ruth away!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the dust was settling fast, and suddenly Ruth uttered a scream of\nfear.\n\nAnd a strangled cry broke from Kay's throat as he looked down at what\nhad been Cliff Hynes.\n\nThe man seemed to have become resolved into the same sort of\nprotoplasm as the Earth Giants. He lay, a little heap, incredibly\nsmall, incredibly distorted. Flesh without bones, shapeless lumps of\nflesh where arms and legs and body frame should have been.\n\nCliff's voice came faintly. \"You remember the leakage through the\nrubber and analektron container, Kay. The W-rays even fused the\ncraolite socket. The psenium rays are stronger. They destroy even\nbone. They're fatal to the man who operates the machine, unless he\nfollows the directions. I've written them out for you, but I had--no\ntime--to apply them.\"\n\nHis voice broke off. Then, \"Good luck to you and--Ruth, Kay,\" he\nwhispered, absent inaudibly. \"Don't let--her--look at me.\"\n\nKay led Ruth gently away. \"Did you hear that?\" she whispered, sobbing.\n\"He died to save us Kay.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was like a return from the grave for the amazed boys and girls\nwho--since the onset of the monsters had destroyed the electric\nlines--poured out of the plain of Golgotha to life and freedom.\n\nMany of them had gone mad, a few had died of fright, but the rest\nwould come back to normal, and the world was saved.\n\nHunger was their greatest problem, for, despite Kay's hurried flight\nto the nearest occupied post, it was difficult to convince the\nFederation officials that the devils were really gone, buried beneath\na mile of crumbled earth. And Kay had to be back to mop up other,\nsmaller bands that had spread through the forests.\n\nIt was six months before the last of the monsters had been\nobliterated, and then Kay, now one of the highest officials in the\nFederation's service, was granted a lunarian's leave of absence\npending his taking command of an Antarctic expedition for the purpose\nof destroying the remaining monsters in their lair.\n\nHe took this opportunity to be married to Ruth, in the church in his\nnative town, which was _en f\u00eate_ for the occasion.\n\n\"Thinking of Cliff?\" Kay asked his bride, as she settled in his plane\npreparatory to their starting for the honeymoon in the Adirondacks. \"I\nthink he would be happy if he knew. He saved the world, dear; he gave\nhis best. And that was all he wanted.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Advertisement: ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Pirate Planet\n\nBEGINNING A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Charles W. Diffin_\n\n[Illustration: Like rats in a cage, the planes of the 91st Squadron\nwere darting and whirling.]\n\n[Sidenote: A strange light blinks on Venus, and over old Earth hovers\na mysterious visitant--dread harbinger of interplanetary war.]\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nLieutenant McGuire threw open his coat with its winged insignia of the\nair force and leaned back in his chair to read more comfortably the\nnewspaper article.\n\nHe glanced at Captain Blake across the table. The captain was deep in\na game of solitaire, but he looked up at McGuire's audible chuckle.\n\n\"Gay old girl!\" said Lieutenant McGuire and smoothed the paper across\nhis knees. \"She's getting flirtatious.\"\n\nThe captain swore softly as he gathered up his cards. \"Not\ninterested,\" he announced; \"too hot to-night. Keep her away.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's far enough away,\" McGuire responded; \"about seventy million\nmiles. Don't get excited.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" The captain shuffled his cards\nirritably.\n\n\"Venus. She's winking at us, the old reprobate. One of these\nstar-gazers up on Mount Lawson saw the flashes a week or so ago. If\nyou'll cut out your solitaire and listen, I'll read you something to\nimprove your mind.\" He ignored the other's disrespectful remark and\nheld the paper closer to see the paragraphs.\n\n\"Is Venus Signalling?\" inquired the caption which Lieutenant McGuire\nread. \"Professor Sykes of Mt. Lawson Observatory Reports Flashes.\n\n\"The planet Venus, now a brilliant spectacle in the evening sky, is\nbehaving strangely according to a report from the local observatory on\nMount Lawson. This sister star, most like Earth of all the planets, is\nnow at its eastern elongation, showing like a half-moon in the big\ntelescopes on Mt. Lawson. Shrouded in impenetrable clouds, its surface\nhas never been seen, but something is happening there. Professor Sykes\nreports seeing a distinct flash of light upon the terminator, or\nmargin of light. It lasted for several seconds and was not repeated.\n\n\"No explanation of the phenomenon is offered by scientists, as\nconditions on the planet's surface are unknown. Is there life there?\nAre the people of Venus trying to communicate? One guess is as good as\nanother. But it is interesting to recall that our scientists recently\nproposed to send a similar signal from Earth to Mars by firing a\ntremendous flare of magnesium.\n\n\"Venus is now approaching the earth; she comes the nearest of all\nplanets. Have the Venusians penetrated their cloak of cloud masses\nwith a visible light? The planet will be watched with increased\ninterest as it swings toward us in space, in hope of there being a\nrepetition of the unexplained flash.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There,\" said Lieutenant McGuire,\"--doesn't that elevate your mind?\nTake it off this infernally hot night? Carry you out through the cool\nreaches of interplanetary space? If there is anything else you want to\nknow, just ask me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Captain Blake agree, \"there is. I want to know how the game\ncame out back in New York--and you don't know that. Let's go over and\nask the radio man. He probably has the dope.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said McGuire; \"maybe he has picked up a message from\nVenus; we'll make a date.\" He looked vainly for the brilliant star as\nthey walked out into the night. There were clouds of fog from the\nnearby Pacific drifting high overhead. Here and there stars showed\nmomentarily, then were blotted from sight.\n\nThe operator in the radio room handed the captain a paper with the\nday's scores from the eastern games. But Lieutenant McGuire, despite\nhis ready amusement at the idea, found his thoughts clinging to the\nwords he had read. \"Was the planet communicating?\" he pictured the\ngreat globe--another Earth--slipping silently through space, coming\nnearer and nearer.\n\nDid they have radio? he wondered. Would they send recognizable\nsignals--words--or some mathematical sequence to prove their reality?\nHe turned to the radio operator on duty.\n\n\"Have you picked up anything peculiar,\" he asked, and laughed inwardly\nat himself for the asking. \"Any new dots and dashes? The scientists\nsay that Venus is calling. You'll have to be learning a new code.\"\n\nThe man glanced at him strangely and looked quickly away.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said. And added after a pause: \"No new dots and dashes.\"\n\n\"Don't take that stuff too seriously, Mac,\" the captain remonstrated.\n\"The day of miracles is past; we don't want to commit you to the\npsychopathic ward. Now here is something real: the Giants won, and I\nhad ten dollars on them. How shall we celebrate?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe radio man was listening intently as they started to leave. His\nvoice was hesitating as he stopped them; he seemed reluctant to put\nhis thoughts into words.\n\n\"Just a minute, sir,\" he said to Captain Blake.\n\n\"Well?\" the captain asked. And again the man waited before he replied.\nThen--\n\n\"Lieutenant McGuire asked me,\" he began, \"if I had heard any strange\ndots and dashes. I have not; but ... well, the fact is, sir, that I\nhave been getting some mighty queer sounds for the past few nights.\nThey've got me guessing.\n\n\"If you wouldn't mind waiting. Captain; they're about due now--\" He\nlistened again to some signal inaudible to the others, then hooked up\ntwo extra head-sets for the officers.\n\n\"It's on now,\" he said. \"If you don't mind--\"\n\nMcGuire grinned at the captain as they took up the ear-phones. \"Power\nof suggestion,\" he whispered, but the smile was erased from his lips\nas he listened. For in his ear was sounding a weird and wailing note.\n\nNo dots or dashes, as the operator had said, but the signal was\nstrong. It rose and fell and wavered into shrill tremolos, a ghostly,\nunearthly sound, and it kept on and on in a shrill despairing wail.\nAbruptly it stopped.\n\nThe captain would have removed the receiver from his ear, but the\noperator stopped him. \"Listen,\" he said, \"to the answer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence, broken only by an occasional hiss and crackle of\nsome far distant mountain storm. Then, faint as a whisper, came an\nanswering, whistling breath.\n\nIt, too, trembled and quavered. It went up--up--to the limit of\nhearing; then slid down the scale to catch and tremble and again\nascend in endless unvarying ups and downs of sound. It was another\nunbroken, unceasing, but always changing vibration.\n\n\"What in thunder is that?\" Captain Blake demanded.\n\n\"Communication of some sort, I should say,\" McGuire said slowly, and\nhe caught the operator's eyes upon him in silent agreement.\n\n\"No letters,\" Blake objected; \"no breaks; just that screech.\" He\nlistened again. \"Darned if it doesn't almost seem to say something,\"\nhe admitted.\n\n\"When did you first hear this?\" he demanded of the radio man.\n\n\"Night before last, sir. I did not report it. It seemed too--too--\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Captain Blake in understanding, \"but it is some form\nof broadcasting on a variable wave; though how a thing like that can\nmake sense--\"\n\n\"They talk back and forth,\" said the operator; \"all night, most.\nNotice the loud one and the faint one; two stations sending and\nanswering.\"\n\nCaptain Blake waved him to silence. \"Wait--wait!\" he ordered. \"It's\ngrowing louder!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the ears of the listening men the noise dropped to a loud grumble; rose\nto a piercing shriek; wavered and leaped rapidly from note to note. It was\nincreasing; rushing upon them with unbearable sound. The sense of something\napproaching, driving toward them swiftly, was strong upon Lieutenant\nMcGuire. He tore the head-phones from his ears and rushed to the door. The\ncaptain was beside him. Whoever--whatever--was sending that mysterious\nsignal was coming near--but was that nearness a matter of miles or of\nthousands of miles?\n\nThey stared at the stormy night sky above. A moon was glowing faintly\nbehind scudding clouds, and the gray-black of flying shadows formed an\nopening as they watched, a wind-blown opening like a doorway to the\ninfinity beyond, where, blocking out the stars, was a something that\nbrought a breath-catching shout from the watching men.\n\nSome five thousand feet up in the night was a gleaming ship. There\nwere rows of portholes that shone twinkling against the black\nsky--portholes in multiple rows on the side. The craft was\ninconceivably huge. Formless and dim of outline in the darkness, its\nvast bulk was unmistakable.\n\nAnd as they watched with staring, incredulous eyes, it seemed to take\nalarm as if it sensed the parting of its concealing cloud blanket. It\nshot with dizzy speed and the roar of a mighty meteor straight up into\nthe night. The gleam of its twinkling lights merged to a distant star\nthat dwindled, shrank and vanished in the heights.\n\nThe men were wordless and open-mouthed. They stared at each other in\ndisbelief of what their eyes had registered.\n\n\"A liner!\" gasped Captain Blake. \"A--a--liner! Mac, there is no such\nthing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire pointed where the real cause of their visitor's departure\nappeared. A plane with engine wide open came tearing down through the\nclouds. It swung in a great spiral down over the field and dropped a\nwhite flare as it straightened away; then returned for the landing. It\ntaxied at reckless speed toward the hangars and stopped a short\ndistance from the men. The pilot threw himself out of the cockpit and\nraced drunkenly toward them.\n\n\"Did you see it?\" he shouted, his voice a cracked scream. \"Did you see\nit?\"\n\n\"We saw it,\" said Captain Blake; \"yes, we saw it. Big as--\" He sought\nvainly for a proper comparison, then repeated his former words: \"Big\nas an ocean liner!\"\n\nThe pilot nodded; he was breathing heavily.\n\n\"Any markings?\" asked his superior. \"Anything to identify it?\"\n\n\"Yes, there were markings, but I don't know what they mean. There was\na circle painted on her bow and marks like clouds around it, but I\ndidn't have time to see much. I came out of a cloud, and there the\nthing was. I was flying at five thousand, and they hung there dead\nahead. I couldn't believe it; it was monstrous; tremendous. Then they\nsighted me, I guess, and they up-ended that ship in mid-air and shot\nstraight up till they were out of sight.\"\n\nIt was the captain's turn to nod mutely.\n\n\"There's your miracle,\" said Lieutenant McGuire softly.\n\n\"Miracle is right,\" agreed Captain Blake; \"nothing less! But it is no\nmiracle of ours, and I am betting it doesn't mean any good to us. Some\nother country has got the jump on us.\"\n\nTo the pilot he ordered: \"Say nothing of this--not a word--get that?\nLet me have a written report: full details, but concise as possible.\"\n\nHe went back to the radio room, and the operator there received the\nsame instructions.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" the lieutenant questioned.\n\nCaptain Blake was reaching for a head-set. \"Listen in,\" he said\nbriefly; \"try to link up that impossible ship with those messages,\nthen report at once to the colonel and whoever he calls in. I'll want\nyou along, Mac, to swear I am sober.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had a head-set adjusted, and McGuire took up the other. Again the\nroom was still, and again from the far reaches of space the dark night\nsent to them its quavering call.\n\nThe weird shrillness cried less loudly now, and the men listened in\nstrained silence to the go and come of that variable shriek. Musical\nat times as it leaped from one clear note to another, again it would\nmerge into discordant blendings of half-tones that sent shivers of\nnervous reaction up the listeners' spines.\n\n\"Listen,\" said McGuire abruptly. \"Check me on this. There are two of\nthem, one loud and one faint--right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Captain Blake.\n\n\"Now notice the time intervals--there! The faint one stops, and the\nbig boy cuts in immediately. No waiting; he answers quickly. He does\nit every time.\"\n\n\"Well?\" the captain asked.\n\n\"Listen when he stops and see how long before the faint one answers.\nCall the loud one the ship and the faint one the station.... There!\nThe ship is through!\"\n\nThere was pause; some seconds elapsed before the answer that whispered\nso faintly in their ears came out of the night.\n\n\"You are right, sir,\" the operator said in corroboration of McGuire's\nremark. \"There is that wait every time.\"\n\n\"The ship answers at once,\" said McGuire; \"the station only after a\nwait.\"\n\n\"Meaning--?\" inquired the captain.\n\n\"Meaning, as I take it, that there is time required for the message to\ngo from the ship to the station and for them to reply.\"\n\n\"An appreciable time like that,\" Captain Blake exclaimed, \"--with\nradio! Why, a few seconds, even, would carry it around the world a\nscore of times!\"\n\nLieutenant McGuire hesitated a moment. \"It happens every time,\" he\nreminded the captain: \"it is no coincidence. And if that other station\nis out in space--another ship perhaps, relaying the messages to yet\nothers between here and--Venus, let us say....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe left the thought unfinished. Captain Blake was staring at him as\none who beholds a fellow-man suddenly insane. But the look in his eyes\nchanged slowly, and his lips that had been opened in remonstrance came\ngradually in a firm, straight line.\n\n\"Crazy!\" he said, but it was apparent that he was speaking as much to\nhimself as to McGuire. \"Plumb, raving crazy!... Yet that ship _did_ go\nstraight up out of sight--an acceleration in the upper air beyond\nanything we know. It might be--\" And he, too, stopped at the actual\nvoicing of the wild surmise. He shook his head sharply as if to rid it\nof intruding, unwelcome thoughts.\n\n\"Forget that!\" he told McGuire, and repeated it in a less commanding\ntone. \"Forget it, Mac: we've got to render a report to sane men, you\nand I. What we know will be hard enough for them to believe without\nany wild guesses.\n\n\"That new craft is real. It has got it all over us for size and speed\nand potential offensive action. Who made it? Who mans it? Red Russia?\nJapan? That's what the brass hats will be wondering; that's what they\nwill want to find out.\n\n\"Not a word!\" he repeated to the radio man. \"You will keep mum on\nthis.\"\n\nHe took McGuire with him as he left to seek out his colonel. But it\nwas a disturbed and shaken man, instead of the cool, methodical\nCaptain Blake of ordinary days, who went in search of his commanding\nofficer. And he clung to McGuire for corroboration of his impossible\nstory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a group of officers to whom Blake made his full report.\nColonel Boynton had heard but little when he halted his subordinate\ncurtly and reached for a phone. And his words over that instrument\nbrought a quick conference of officers and a quiet man whom McGuire\ndid not recognize. The \"brass hats,\" as Blake had foreseen, were avid\nfor details.\n\nThe pilot of the incoming plane was there, too, and the radio man.\nTheir stories were told in a disconcerting silence, broken only by\nsome officer's abrupt and skeptical question on one point and another.\n\n\"Now, for heaven's sake, shut up about Venus,\" McGuire had been told.\nBut he did not need Captain Blake's warning to hold himself strictly\nto what he had seen and let the others draw their own conclusions.\n\nLieutenant McGuire was the last one to speak. There was silence in the\noffice of Colonel Boynton as he finished, a silence that almost echoed\nfrom the grim walls. And the faces of the men who gathered there were\ncarefully masked from any expression that might betray their thoughts.\n\nIt was the quiet man in civilian attire who spoke first. He sat beside\nanother whose insignia proclaimed him of general's rank, but he\naddressed himself to Colonel Boynton.\n\n\"I am very glad,\" he said quietly, \"very glad. Colonel, that my\nunofficial visit came at just this time. I should like to ask some few\nquestions.\"\n\nColonel Boynton shifted the responsibility with a gesture almost of\nrelief. \"It is in your hands. Mr. Secretary,\" he said. \"You and\nGeneral Clinton have dropped in opportunely. There is something here\nthat will tax all our minds.\"\n\nThe man in civilian clothes nodded assent. He turned to Captain Blake.\n\n\"Captain,\" he said, \"you saw this at first hand. You have told us what\nyou saw. I should like greatly to know what you think. Will you give\nus your opinion, your impressions?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe captain arose smartly, but his words came with less ease.\n\n\"My opinion,\" he stated, \"will be of little value, but it is based\nupon these facts. I have seen to-night, sir, a new type of aircraft,\nwith speed, climb and ceiling beyond anything we are capable of. I\ncan only regard it as a menace. It may or may not have been armed, but\nit had the size to permit the armament of a cruiser; it had power to\ncarry that weight. It hung stationary in the air, so it is independent\nof wing-lift, yet it turned and shot upward like a feather in a gale.\nThat spells maneuverability.\n\n\"That combination, sir, can mean only that we are out-flown,\nout-maneuvered and out-fought in the air. It means that the planes in\nour hangars are obsolete, our armament so much old iron.\n\n\"The menace is potential at present. Whether it is an actual threat or\nnot is another matter. Who mans that ship--what country's insignia she\ncarries--is something on which I can have no opinion. The power is\nthere: who wields it I wish we knew.\"\n\nThe questioner nodded at the conclusion of Blake's words, and he\nexchanged quiet, grave glances with the general beside him. Then--\n\n\"I think we all would wish to know that, Captain Blake,\" he observed.\nAnd to the colonel: \"You may be able to answer that soon. It would be\nmy idea that this craft should be--ah--drawn out, if we can do it. We\nwould not attack it, of course, until its mission is proved definitely\nunfriendly, but you will resist any offensive from them.\n\n\"And now,\" he added, \"let us thank these officers for their able\nreports and excuse them. We have much to discuss....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Blake took McGuire's arm as they went out into the night. And\nhe drew him away where they walked for silent minutes by themselves.\nThe eyes of Lieutenant McGuire roamed upward to the scudding clouds\nand the glimpse of far, lonely stars; he stumbled occasionally as he\nwalked. But for Captain Blake there was thought only of matters\nnearby.\n\n\"The old fox!\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't he 'sic us on' neatly? If we mix\nit with that stranger there will be no censure from the Secretary of\nWar.\"\n\n\"I assumed that was who it was,\" said McGuire. \"Well, they have\nsomething to think about, that bunch; something to study over....\nPerhaps more than they know.\n\n\"And that's their job,\" he concluded after a silence. \"I'm going to\nbed; but I would like a leave of absence to-morrow if that's O. K.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Captain Blake, \"though I should think you would like to\nstick around. Perhaps we will see something. What's on your mind,\nMac?\"\n\n\"A little drive to the top of Mount Lawson,\" said Lieutenant McGuire.\n\"I want to talk to a bird named Sykes.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nLieutenant McGuire, U. S. A., was not given as a usual thing to vain\nconjectures, nor did his imagination carry him beyond the practical\nboundaries of accepted facts. Yet his mind, as he drove for hours\nthrough the orange-scented hills of California, reverted time and\nagain to one persistent thought. And it was with him still, even when\nhe was consciously concentrating on the hairpin turns of Mount\nLawson's narrow road.\n\nThere was a picture there, printed indelibly in his mind--a picture of\na monstrous craft, a liner of the air, that swung its glowing lights\nin a swift arc and, like a projectile from some huge gun, shot up and\nup and still up until it vanished in a jet-black sky. Its altitude\nwhen it passed from sight he could not even guess, but the sense of\never-increasing speed, of power that mocked at gravitation's puny\nforce, had struck deep into his mind. And McGuire saw plainly this\nmystery ship going on and on far into the empty night where man had\nnever been.\n\nNo lagging in that swift flight that he had seen; an acceleration that\nthrew the ship faster and yet faster, regardless of the thin air and\nthe lessened buoyancy in an ocean of atmosphere that held man-made\nmachines so close to Earth. That constant acceleration, hour after\nhour, day after day--the speed would be almost unlimited;\ninconceivable!\n\nHe stopped his car where the mountain road held straight for a hundred\nfeet, and he looked out over the coastal plain spread like a toy world\nfar below.\n\n\"Now, how about it?\" he asked himself. \"Blake thinks I am making a\nfool of myself. Perhaps I am. I wonder. It's a long time since I fell\nfor any fairy stories. But this thing has got me. A sort of hunch, I\nguess.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was shining now from a vault of clear blue. It was lighting a\nworld of reality, of houses where people lived their commonplace\nlives, tiny houses squared off in blocks a mile below. There was smoke\nhere and there from factories; it spread in a haze, and it meant\nboilers and engines and sound practical machinery of a practical world\nto the watching man.\n\nWhat had all this to do with Venus? he asked himself. This was the\nworld he knew. It was real; space was impenetrable; there were no men\nor beings of any sort that could travel through space. Blake was\nright: he was on a fool's errand. They couldn't tell him anything up\nhere at the observatory; they would laugh at him as he deserved....\n\nWondering vaguely if there was a place to turn around, he looked ahead\nand then up; his eyes passed from the gash of roadway on the\nmountainside to the deep blue beyond. And within the man some driving,\ninsistent, mental force etched strongly before his eyes that picture\nand its problem unanswered. There was the ship--he saw it in\nmemory--and it went up and still up; and he knew as surely as if he\nhad guided the craft that the meteor-like flight could be endless.\n\nLieutenant McGuire could not reason it out--such power was beyond his\nimagining--but suddenly he dared to believe, and he knew it was true.\n\n\"Earthbound!\" he said in contempt of his own human kind, and he looked\nagain at the map spread below. \"Ants! Mites! That's what we\nare--swarming across the surface of the globe. And we think we're so\ndamn clever if we lift ourselves up a few miles from the surface!\n\n\"Guess I'll see Sykes,\" he muttered aloud. \"He and his kind at least\ndare to look out into space; take their eyes off the world; be\nimpractical!\"\n\nHe swung the car slowly around the curve ahead, eased noiselessly into\nsecond gear and went on with the climb.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were domed observatories where he stopped: rounded structures\nthat gleamed silvery in the air; and offices, laboratories: it was a\nplace of busy men. And Professor Sykes, he found, was busy. But he\nspared a few minutes to answer courteously the questions of this slim\nyoung fellow in the khaki uniform of the air service.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" asked Professor Sykes.\n\n\"No dreamer, this man,\" thought McGuire as he looked at the short,\nstocky figure of the scientist. Clear eyes glanced sharply from under\nshaggy brows; there were papers in his hand scrawled over with strange\nmathematical symbols.\n\n\"You can answer some fool questions,\" said Lieutenant McGuire\nabruptly, \"if you don't mind.\"\n\nThe scientist smiled broadly. \"We're used to that,\" he told the young\nofficer; \"you can't think of any worse ones than those we have heard.\nHave a chair.\"\n\nMcGuire drew a clipping from his pocket--it was the newspaper account\nhe had read--and he handed it to Professor Sykes.\n\n\"I came to see you about this,\" he began.\n\nThe lips of Professor Sykes lost their genial curve; they straightened\nto a hard line. \"Nothing for publication,\" he said curtly. \"As usual\nthey enlarged upon the report and made assumptions and inferences not\nwarranted by facts.\"\n\n\"But you did see that flash?\"\n\n\"By visual observation I saw a bright area formed on the\nterminator--yes! We have no photographic corroboration.\"\n\n\"I am wondering what it meant.\"\n\n\"That is your privilege--and mine,\" said the scientist coldly.\n\n\"But it said there,\" McGuire persisted, \"that it might have been a\nsignal of some sort.\"\n\n\"_I_ did not say so: that is an inference only. I have told you,\nLieutenant\"--he glanced at the card in his hand--\"--Lieutenant\nMcGuire--all that I know. We deal in facts up here, and we leave the\nbrilliant theorizing to the journalists.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young officer felt distinctly disconcerted. He did not know\nexactly what he had expected from this man--what corroboration of his\nwild surmises--but he was getting nowhere, he admitted. And he\nresented the cold aloofness of the scientist before him.\n\n\"I am not trying to pin you down on anything,\" he said, and his tone\ncarried a hint of the nervous strain that had been his. \"I am trying\nto learn something.\"\n\n\"Just what?\" the other inquired.\n\n\"Could that flash have been a signal?\"\n\n\"You may think so if you wish: I have told you all that I know. And\nnow,\" he added, and rose from his chair, \"I must ask to be excused; I\nhave work to do.\"\n\nMcGuire came slowly to his feet. He had learned nothing; perhaps there\nwas nothing to be learned. A fool's errand! Blake was right. But the\ninner urge for some definite knowledge drove him on. His eyes were\nserious and his face drawn to a scowl of earnestness as he turned once\nmore to the waiting man.\n\n\"Professor Sykes,\" he demanded, \"just one more question. Could that\nhave been the flash of a--a rocket? Like the proposed experiments in\nGermany. Could it have meant in any way the launching of a\nprojectile--a ship--to travel Earthward through space?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Sykes knew what it was to be harassed by the curious mob, to\navoid traps set by ingenious reporters, but he knew, too, when he was\nmeeting with honest bewilderment and a longing for knowledge. His\nfists were placed firmly on the hips of his stocky figure as he stood\nlooking at the persistent questioner, and his eyes passed from the\nintent face to the snug khaki coat and the spread wings that\nproclaimed the wearer's work. A ship out of space--a projectile--this\nyoung man had said.\n\n\"Lieutenant,\" he suggested quietly--and again the smile had returned\nto his lips as he spoke--\"sit down. I'm not as busy as I pretend to\nbe. Now tell me: what in the devil have you got in your mind?\"\n\nAnd McGuire told him. \"Like some of your dope,\" he said, \"this is not\nfor publication. But I have not been instructed to hush it up, and I\nknow you will keep it to yourself.\"\n\nHe told the clear-eyed, listening man of the previous night's events.\nOf the radio's weird call and the mystery ship.\n\n\"Hallucination,\" suggested the scientist. \"You saw the stars very\nclearly, and they suggested a ship.\"\n\n\"Tell that to Jim Burgess,\" said McGuire: \"he was the pilot of that\nplane.\" And the scientist nodded as if the answer were what he\nexpected.\n\nHe asked again about the ship's flight. And he, too, bore down heavily\nupon the matter of acceleration in the thin upper air. He rose to lay\na friendly hand on McGuire's shoulder.\n\n\"We can't know what it means,\" he said, \"but we can form our own\ntheories, you and I--and anything is possible.\n\n\"It is getting late,\" he added, \"and you have had a long drive. Come\nover and eat; spend the night here. Perhaps you would like to have a\nlook at our equipment--see Venus for yourself. I will be observing her\nthrough the sixty-inch refractor to-night. Would you care to?\"\n\n\"Would I?\" McGuire demanded with enthusiasm. \"Say, that will be\ngreat!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was dropping toward the horizon when the two men again came\nout into the cool mountain air.\n\n\"Just time for a quick look around,\" suggested Professor Sykes, \"if\nyou are interested.\"\n\nHe took the lieutenant first to an enormous dome that bulged high\nabove the ground, and admitted him to the dark interior. They climbed\na stairway and came out into a room that held a skeleton frame of\nsteel. \"This is the big boy,\" said Professor Sykes, \"the one\nhundred-inch reflector.\"\n\nThere were other workers there, one a man standing upon a raised\nplatform beside the steel frame, who arranged big holders for\nphotographic plates. The slotted ceiling opened as McGuire watched,\nand the whole structure swung slowly around. It was still, and the\ntowering steel frame began to swing noiselessly when a man at a desk\ntouched various controls. McGuire looked about him in bewilderment.\n\n\"Quite a shop,\" he admitted; \"but where is the telescope?\"\n\nProfessor Sykes pointed to the towering latticework of steel. \"Right\nthere,\" he said. \"Like everyone else, you were expecting to see a big\ntube.\"\n\nHe explained in simple words the operation of the great instrument\nthat brought in light rays from sources millions of light years away.\nHe pointed out where the big mirror was placed--the one hundred-inch\nreflector--and he traced for the wondering man the pathway of light\nthat finally converged upon a sensitized plate to catch and record\nwhat no eye had ever seen.\n\nHe checked the younger man's flow of questions and turned him back\ntoward the stairs. \"We will leave them to their work,\" he said; \"they\nwill be gathering light that has been traveling millions of years on\nits ways. But you and I have something a great deal nearer to study.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother building held the big refractor, and it was a matter of only a\nfew seconds and some cryptic instructions from Sykes until the\neye-piece showed the image of the brilliant planet.\n\n\"The moon!\" McGuire exclaimed in disappointed tones when the professor\nmotioned him to see for himself. His eyes saw a familiar half-circle\nof light.\n\n\"Venus,\" the professor informed him. \"It has phases like the moon. The\nplanet is approaching; the sun's light strikes it from the side.\" But\nMcGuire hardly heard. He was gazing with all his faculties centered\nupon that distant world, so near to him now.\n\n\"Venus,\" he whispered half aloud. Then to the professor: \"It's all\nhazy. There are no markings--\"\n\n\"Clouds,\" said the other. \"The goddess is veiled; Venus is blanketed\nin clouds. What lies underneath we may never know, but we do know that\nof all the planets this is most like the earth; most probably is an\ninhabited world. Its size, its density, your weight if you were\nthere--and the temperature under the sun's rays about double that of\nours. Still, the cloud envelope would shield it.\"\n\nMcGuire was fascinated, and his thoughts raced wildly in speculation\nof what might be transpiring before his eyes. People, living in that\ntropical world; living and going through their daily routine under\nthat cloud-filled sky where the sun was never seen. The margin of\nlight that made the clear shape of a half-moon marked their daylight\nand dark; there was one small dot of light forming just beyond that\nmargin. It penetrated the dark side. And it grew, as he watched, to a\nbright patch.\n\n\"What is that?\" he inquired abstractedly--his thoughts were still\nfilled with those beings of his imagination. \"There is a light that\nextends into the dark part. It is spreading--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found himself thrust roughly aside as Professor Sykes applied a\nmore understanding eye to the instrument.\n\nThe professor whirled abruptly to his assistant. \"Phone Professor\nGiles,\" he said sharply; \"he is working on the reflector. Tell him to\nget a photograph of Venus at once; the cloud envelope is broken.\" He\nreturned hurriedly to his observations. One hand sketched on a waiting\npad.\n\n\"Markings!\" he said exultantly. \"If it would only hold!... There, it\nis closing ... gone....\"\n\nHis hand was quiet now upon the paper, but where he had marked was a\ncrude sketch of what might have been an island. It was \"L\" shaped;\nsharply bent.\n\n\"Whew!\" breathed Professor Sykes and looked up for a moment. \"Now that\nwas interesting.\"\n\n\"You saw through?\" asked McGuire eagerly. \"Glimpsed the surface?--an\nisland?\"\n\nThe scientist's face relaxed. \"Don't jump to conclusions,\" he told the\naviator: \"we are not ready to make a geography of Venus quite yet. But\nwe shall know that mark if we ever see it again. I hardly think they\nhad time to get a picture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And now there is only a matter of three hours for observation: I must\nwatch every minute. Stay here if you wish. But,\" he added, \"don't let\nyour imagination run wild. Some eruption, perhaps, this we have\nseen--an ignition of gasses in the upper air--who knows? But don't\nconnect this with your mysterious ship. If the ship is a menace, if it\nmeans war, that is your field of action, not mine. And you will be\nfighting with someone on Earth. It must be that some country has\ngained a big lead in aeronautics. Now I must get to work.\"\n\n\"I'll not wait,\" said McGuire. \"I will start for the field; get there\nby daylight, if I can find my way down that road in the dark.\"\n\n\"Thanks a lot.\" He paused a moment before concluding slowly: \"And in\nspite of what you say, Professor, I believe that we will have\nsomething to get together on again in this matter.\"\n\nThe scientist, he saw, had turned again to his instrument. McGuire\npicked his way carefully along the narrow path that led where he had\nparked his car. \"Good scout, this Sykes!\" he was thinking, and he\nstopped to look overhead in the quick-gathering dark at that\nlaboratory of the heavens, where Sykes and his kind delved and probed,\nmeasured and weighed, and gathered painstakingly the messages from\nsuns beyond counting, from universe out there in space that added\ntheir bit of enlightenment to the great story of the mystery of\ncreation.\n\nHe was humbly aware of his own deep ignorance as he backed his car,\nslipped it into second, and began the long drive down the tortuous\ngrade. He would have liked to talk more with Sykes. But he had no\nthought as he wound round the curves how soon that wish was to be\ngratified.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPart way down the mountainside he again checked his car where he had\nstopped on the upward climb and reasoned with himself about his\nerrand. Once more he looked out over the level ground below, a vast\nglowing expanse of electric lights now, that stretched to the ocean\nbeyond. He was suddenly unthrilled by this man-made illumination, and\nhe got out of his car to stare again at the blackness above and its\nmyriad of stars that gathered and multiplied as he watched.\n\nOne brighter than the rest winked suddenly out. There was a\nconstellation of twinkling lights that clustered nearby, and they too\nvanished. The eyes of the watcher strained themselves to see more\nclearly a dim-lit outline. There were no lights: it was a black\nshape, lost in the blackness of the mountain sky, that was blocking\nout the stars. But it was a shape, and from near the horizon the pale\ngleams of the rising moon picked it out in softest of outline; a vague\nghost of a curve that reflected a silvery contour to the watching eyes\nbelow.\n\nThere had been a wider space in the road that McGuire had passed; he\nbacked carefully till he could swing his car and turn it to head once\nmore at desperate speed toward the mountain top. And it was less than\nan hour since he had left when he was racing back along the narrow\nfootpath to slam open the door where Professor Sykes looked up in\namazement at his abrupt return.\n\nThe aviator's voice was hoarse with excitement as he shouted: \"It's\nhere--the ship! It's here! Where's your phone?--I must call the field!\nIt's right overhead--descending slowly--no lights, but I saw it--I saw\nit!\"\n\nHe was working with trembling fingers at the phone where Sykes had\npointed. \"Long distance!\" he shouted. He gave a number to the\noperator. \"Make it quick,\" he implored. \"Quick!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBack at Maricopa Flying Field the daily routine had been disturbed.\nThere were conferences of officers, instructions from Colonel Boynton,\nand a curiosity-provoking lack of explanations. Only with Captain\nBlake did the colonel indulge in any discussion.\n\n\"We'll keep this under our hats,\" he said, \"and out of the newspapers\nas long as we can. You can imagine what the yellow journals would do\nwith a scarehead like that. Why, they would have us all wiped off the\nmap and the country devastated by imaginary fleets in the first three\nparagraphs.\"\n\nBlake regarded his superior gravely. \"I feel somewhat the same way,\nmyself. Colonel,\" he admitted. \"When I think what this can mean--some\nother country so far ahead of us in air force that we are back in the\ndark ages--well, it doesn't look any too good to me if they mean\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"We will meet it when it comes,\" said Colonel Boynton. \"But, between\nourselves, I am in the same state of mind.\n\n\"The whole occurrence is so damn mysterious. Washington hasn't a\nwhisper of information of any such construction; the Secretary\nadmitted that last night. It's a surprise, a complete surprise, to\neveryone.\n\n\"But, Blake, you get that new ship ready as quickly as you can.\nPrepare for an altitude test the same as we planned, but get into the\nair the first minute possible. She ought to show a better ceiling than\nanything we have here, and you may have to fly high to say 'Good\nmorning' to that liner you saw. Put all the mechanics on it that can\nwork to advantage. I think they have it pretty well along now.\"\n\n\"Engine's tested and installed, sir,\" was Blake's instant report. \"I\nthink I can take it up this afternoon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe left immediately to hurry to the hangar where a new plane stood\nglistening in pristine freshness, and where hurrying mechanics\ngrumbled under their breaths at the sudden rush for a ship that was\nexpected to take the air a week later.\n\nAn altitude test under full load! Well, what of it? they demanded one\nof another; wouldn't another day do as well as this one? And they\nworked as they growled, worked with swift sureness and skill, and the\nfinal instruments took their place in the ship that she might roll\nfrom the hangar complete under that day's sun.\n\nHer supercharger was tested--the adjunct to a powerful engine that\nwould feed the hungry cylinders with heavy air up in the heights where\nthe air is thin; there were oxygen flasks to keep life in the pilot in\nthe same thin air. And the hot southern sun made ludicrous that\nafternoon the bulky, heavily-wrapped figure of Captain Blake as he\nsat at the controls and listened approvingly to the roaring engine.\n\nHe waved good-by and smiled understandingly as he met the eyes of\nColonel Boynton; then pulled on his helmet, settled himself in his\nseat and took off in a thunderous blast of sound to begin his long\nascent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had long since cracked open the valve of his oxygen flask when the\nclimb was ended, and his goggles were frosted in the arctic cold so\nthat it was only with difficulty he could read his instrument board.\n\n\"That's the top,\" he thought in that mind so light and so curiously\nnot his own. He throttled the engine and went into a long spiral that\nwas to end within a rod of where he had started on the brown sun-baked\nfield. The last rays of the sun were slanting over distant mountains\nas he climbed stiffly from the machine.\n\n\"Better than fifty thousand,\" exulted Colonel Boynton. \"Of course your\nbarograph will have to be calibrated and verified, but it looks like a\nrecord, Blake--and you had a full load.\n\n\"Ready to go up and give merry hell to that other ship if she shows\nup?\" he asked. But Captain Blake shook a dubious head.\n\n\"Fifty thousand is just a start for that bird,\" he said. \"You didn't\nsee them shoot out of sight, Colonel. Lord knows when they quit\n_their_ climb--or where.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll just have a squadron ready in any event,\" the colonel\nassured him. \"We will make him show his stuff or take a beating--if\nthat is what he wants.\"\n\nThey were in the colonel's office. \"You had better go and get warmed\nup,\" he told the flyer: \"then come back here for instructions.\" But\nBlake was more anxious for information than for other comforts.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he said: \"just tired a bit. Let me stretch out here,\nColonel, and give me the dope on what you expect of our visitor and\nwhat we will do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe settled back comfortably in a big chair. The office was warm, and\nBlake knew now he had been doing a day's work.\n\n\"We will just take it as it comes,\" Colonel Boynton explained. \"I\ncan't for the life of me figure why the craft was spying around here.\nWhat are they looking for? We haven't any big secrets the whole world\ndoesn't know.\n\n\"Of course he may not return. But if he does I want you to go up and\ngive him the once over. I can trust you to note every significant\ndetail.\n\n\"You saw no wings. If it is a dirigible, let's know something of their\npower and how they can throw themselves up into the air the way you\ndescribed. Watch for anything that may serve to identify it and its\nprobable place of manufacture--any peculiarity of marking or design or\nconstruction that may give us a lead. Then return and report.\"\n\nBlake nodded his understanding of what was wanted, but his mind was on\nfurther contingencies: he wanted definite instructions.\n\n\"And,\" he asked; \"if they attack--what then? Is their fire to be\nreturned?\"\n\n\"If they make one single false move,\" said Colonel Boynton savagely,\n\"give them everything you've got. And the 91st Squadron will be off\nthe ground to support you at the first sign of trouble. We don't want\nto start anything, nor appear to do so. But, by the gods, Blake, this\nfellow means trouble eventually as sure as you're a flyer, and we\nwon't wait for him to ask for it twice.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey sat in silence, while the field outside became shrouded in night.\nAnd they speculated, as best they could from the few facts they had,\nas to what this might mean to the world, to their country, to\nthemselves. It was an hour before Blake was aware of the fact that he\nwas hungry.\n\nHe rose to leave, but paused while Colonel Boynton answered the phone.\nThe first startled exclamation held him rigid while he tried to piece\ntogether the officer's curt responses and guess at what was being\ntold.\n\n\"Colonel Boynton speaking.... McGuire?... Yes, Lieutenant.... Over\nMount Lawson?... Yes--yes, the same ship, I've no doubt.\"\n\nHis voice was even and cool in contrast to the excited tones that\ncarried faintly to Blake standing by.\n\n\"Quite right!\" he said shortly. \"You will remain where you are: act as\nobserver: hold this line open and keep me informed. Captain Blake will\nleave immediately for observation. A squadron will follow. Let me know\npromptly what you see.\"\n\nHe turned abruptly to the waiting man.\n\n\"It is back!\" he said. \"We're in luck! Over the observatories at Mount\nLawson; descending, so Lieutenant McGuire says. Take the same ship you\nhad up to-day. Look them over--get up close--good luck!\" He turned\nagain to the phone.\n\nThere were planes rolling from their hangars before Blake could reach\nhis own ship. Their engines were thundering: men were rushing across\nthe field, pulling on leather helmets and coats as they ran--all this\nwhile he warmed up his engine.\n\nA mechanic thrust in a package of sandwiches and a thermos of coffee\nwhile he waited. And Captain Blake grinned cheerfully and gulped the\nlast of his food as he waved to the mechanics to pull out the wheel\nblocks. He opened the throttle and shot out into the dark.\n\nHe climbed and circled the field, saw the waving motion of lights in\nred and green that marked the take-off of the planes of the 91st, and\nhe straightened out on a course that in less than two hours would\nbring him over the heights of Mount Lawson and the mystery that\nawaited him there. And he fingered the trigger grip that was part of\nthe stick and nodded within his dark cockpit at the rattle of a\nmachine gun that merged its staccato notes with the engine's roar.\n\nBut he felt, as he thought of that monster shape, as some primordial\nman might have felt, setting forth with a stone in his hand to wage\nwar on a saurian beast.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIf Colonel Boynton could have stood with one of his lieutenants and\nProfessor Sykes on a mountain top, he would have found, perhaps, the\nanswer to his question. He had wondered in a puzzled fashion why the\ngreat ship had shown its mysterious presence over the flying field. He\nhad questioned whether it was indeed the field that had been the\nobject of their attention or whether in the cloudy murk they had\nmerely wandered past. Could he have seen with the eyes of Lieutenant\nMcGuire the descent of the great shape over Mount Lawson, he would\nhave known beyond doubt that here was the magnet that drew the eyes of\nwhatever crew was manning the big craft.\n\nIt was dark where the two men stood. Others had come running at their\ncall, but their forms, too, were lost in the shadows of the towering\npines. The light from an open door struck across an open space beyond\nwhich McGuire and Professor Sykes stood alone, stood silent and\nspellbound, their heads craned back at a neck-wrenching angle. They\nwere oblivious to all discomforts; their eyes and their whole minds\nwere on the unbelievable thing in the sky.\n\nBeyond the fact that no lights were showing along the hull, there was\nno effort at concealment. The moon was up now to illumine the scene,\nand it showed plainly the gleaming cylinder with its long body and\nblunt, shining ends, dropping, slowly, inexorably down.\n\n\"Like a dirigible,\" said McGuire huskily. \"But the size, man--the\nsize! And its shape is not right; it isn't streamlined correctly; the\nair--\" He stopped his half-unconscious analysis abruptly. \"The air!\"\nWhat had this craft to do with the air? A thin layer of gas that hung\nclose to the earth--the skin on an apple! And beyond--space! There was\nthe ethereal ocean in which this great shape swam!\n\nThe reality of the big ship, the very substance of it, made the space\nship idea the harder to grasp. Lieutenant McGuire found that it was\neasier to see an imaginary craft taking off into space than to\nconceive of this monstrous shape, many hundreds of tons in weight,\nbeing thrown through vast emptiness. Yet he knew; he knew!\n\nAnd his mind was a chaos of grim threats and forebodings as he looked\nat the unbelievable reality and tried to picture what manner of men\nwere watching, peering, from those rows of ports.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last it was motionless. It hung soundless and silent except for a\nsoft roar, a scant thousand feet in the air. And its huge bulk was\ndwarfing the giant pines, the rounded buildings; it threw the men's\nfamiliar surroundings into a new and smaller scale.\n\nHe had many times flown over these mountains, and Lieutenant McGuire\nhad seen the silvery domes of the observatories shining among the\ntrees. Like fortresses for aerial defense, he had thought, and the\nmemory returned to him now. What did these new-comers think of them?\nHad they, too, found them suggestive of forts on the frontier of a\nworld, defenses against invasion from out there? Or did they know them\nfor what they were? Did they wish only to learn the extent of our\nknowledge, our culture? Were they friendly, perhaps?--half-timid and\nfearful of what they might find?\n\nA star moved in the sky, a pin-point of light that was plain in its\nmessage to the aviator. It was Blake, flying high, volplaning to make\ncontact and learn from the air what this stranger might mean. The\nlight of his plane slanted down in an easy descent; the flyer was\ngliding in on a long aerial toboggan slide. His motor was throttled;\nthere was only the whistle of torn air on the monoplane's wings.\nMcGuire was with the captain in his mind, and like him he was waiting\nfor whatever the stranger might do.\n\nOther lights were clustered where the one plane had been. The men of\nthe 91st had their orders, and the fingers of the watching, silent man\ngripped an imaginary stick while he wished with his whole heart that\nhe was up in the air. To be with Blake or the others! His thoughts\nwhipped back to the mysterious stranger: the great shape was in\nmotion: it rose sharply a thousand feet in the air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe approaching plane showed clear in the moon's light. It swung and\nbanked, and the vibrant song of its engine came down to the men as\nBlake swept in a great circle about the big ship. He was looking it\nover, but he began his inspection at a distance, and the orbit of his\nplane made a tightening spiral as he edged for a closer look. He was\nstill swinging in the monotonous round when the ship made its first\nforward move.\n\nIt leaped in the air: it swept faster and faster. And it was moving\nwith terrific speed as it crashed silently through the path of the\ntiny plane. And Blake, as he leaned forward on the stick to throw his\nplane downward in a power dive, could have had a vision, not of a ship\nof the air, but only of a shining projectile as the great monster\nshrieked overhead.\n\nMcGuire trembled for the safety of those wings as he saw Blake pull\nhis little ship out of the dive and shoot upward to a straight climb.\n\nBut--\"That's dodging them!\" he exulted: \"that's flying! I wonder, did\nthey mean to wipe him out or were they only scared off?\"\n\nHis question was answered as, out of the night, a whistling shriek\nproclaimed the passage of the meteor ship that drove unmistakably at\nthe lone plane. And again the pilot with superb skill waited until the\nlast moment and threw himself out of the path of the oncoming mass,\nthough his own plane was tossed and whirled like an autumn leaf in the\nvortex that the enemy created. Not a second was lost as Blake opened\nhis throttle and forced his plane into a steep climb.\n\n\"Atta-boy!\" said McGuire, as if words could span across to the man in\nthe plane. \"Altitude, Blake--get altitude!\"\n\nThe meteor had turned in a tremendous circle; so swift its motion that\nit made an actual line of light as the moon marked its course. And the\ncurved line straightened abruptly to a flashing mark that shot\nstraight toward the struggling plane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time another sound came down to the listening ears of the two\nmen. The plane tore head on to meet the onslaught, to swing at the\nlast instant in a frantic leap that ended as before in the maelstrom\nof air back of the ship. But the muffled roar was changed, punctured\nwith a machine-gun's familiar rattle, and the stabbing flashes from\nBlake's ship before he threw it out of the other's path were a song of\njoy to the tense nerves of the men down below.\n\nThis deadly rush could only be construed as an attack, and Blake was\nfighting back. The very speed of the great projectile must hold it to\nits course; the faster it went the more difficult to swerve it from a\nline. This and much more was flashing sharply in McGuire's mind.\nBut--Blake!--alone against this huge antagonist!... It was coming\nback. Another rush like a star through space....\n\nAnd McGuire shouted aloud in a frenzy of emotion as a cluster of\nlights came falling from on high. No lone machine gun now that tore\nthe air with this clattering bedlam of shots: the planes of the 91st\nSquadron were diving from the heights. They came on a steep slant\nthat seemed marking them for crashing death against the huge cylinder\nflashing past. And their stabbing needles of machine-gun fire made a\ndrumming tattoo, till the planes, with the swiftness of hawks, swept\naside, formed to groups, tore on down toward the ground and then\ncurved in great circles of speed to climb back to the theater of\naction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLieutenant McGuire was rigid and quivering. He should go to the phone\nand report to the colonel, but the thought left him as quickly as it\ncame. He was frozen in place, and his mind could hold only the scene\nthat was being pictured before him.\n\nThe enemy ship had described its swift curve, and the planes of the\ndefenders were climbing desperately for advantage. So slowly they\nmoved as compared with the swiftness of the other!\n\nBut the great ship was slowing; it came on, but its wild speed was\nchecked. The light of the full moon showed plainly now what McGuire\nhad seen but dimly before--a great metal beak on the ship, pointed and\nshining, a ram whose touch must bring annihilation to anything it\nstruck.\n\nThe squadron of planes made a group in the sky, and Blake's monoplane,\ntoo, was with them. The huge enemy was approaching slowly: was it\ndamaged? McGuire hardly dared hope ... yet that raking fire might well\nhave been deadly: it might be that some bullets had torn and\npenetrated to the vitals of this ship's machinery and damaged some\npart.\n\nIt came back slowly, ominously, toward the circling planes. Then,\nthrowing itself through the air, it leaped not directly toward them\nbut off to one side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a stone on the end of a cord it swung with inconceivable speed in\na circle that enclosed the group of planes. Again and again it\nwhipped around them, while the planes, by comparison, were motionless.\nIts orbit was flat with the ground: then tilting, more yet, it made a\nlast circle that stood like a hoop in the air. And behind it as it\ncircled it left a faint trace of vapor. Nebulous!--milky in the\nmoonlight!--but the ship had built a sphere, a great globe of the gas,\nand within it, like rats in a cage, the planes of the 91st Squadron\nwere darting and whirling.\n\n\"Gas!\" groaned the watching man: \"gas! What is it? Why don't they\nbreak through?\"\n\nThe thin clouds of vapor were mingling now and expanding: they\nblossomed and mushroomed, and the light of the moon came in pale\niridescence from their billowing folds.\n\n\"Break through!\" McGuire had prayed--and he stood in voiceless horror\nas he saw the attempt.\n\nThe mist was touching here and there a plane: they were engulfed, yet\nhe could see them plainly. And he saw with staring, fear-filled eyes\nthe clumsy tumbling and fluttering of unguided wings as the great\neagles of the 91st fell roaring to earth with no conscious minds\nguiding their flight.\n\nThe valleys were deep about the mountain, and their shadowed blackness\nopened to receive the maimed, stricken things that came fluttering or\nswooping wildly to that last embrace, where, in the concealing\nshadows, the deeper shadows of death awaited....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a room where a telephone waited: McGuire sensed this but\ndumbly, and the way to that room was long to his stumbling feet. He\nwas blinded: his mind would not function: he saw only those fluttering\nthings, and the moonlight on their wings, and the shadows that took\nthem so softly at the last.\n\nOne plane whistled close overhead. McGuire stopped where he stood to\nfollow it with unbelieving eyes. That one man had lived, escaped the\nnet--it was inconceivable! The plane returned: it was flying low, and\nit swerved erratically as it flew. It was a monoplane: a new ship.\n\nIts motor was silenced: it stalled as he watched, to pancake and crash\nwhere the towering pines made a cradle of great branches to cushion\nits fall.\n\nNo thought now of the colonel waiting impatiently for a report; even\nthe enemy, there in the sky was forgotten. It was Blake in that ship,\nand he was alive--or had been--for he had cut his motor. McGuire\nscreamed out for Professor Sykes, and there were others, too, who came\nrunning at his call. He tore recklessly through the scrub and\nundergrowth and gained at last the place where wreckage hung dangling\nfrom the trees. The fuselage of a plane, scarred and broken, was still\nheld in the strong limbs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Blake was in the cockpit, half hanging from the side. He was\nmotionless, quiet, and his face shone white and ghastly as they\nreleased him and drew him out. But one hand still clung with a grip\nlike death itself to a hose that led from an oxygen tank. McGuire\nstared in wonder and slowly gathering comprehension.\n\n\"He was fixed for an altitude test,\" he said dazedly; \"this ship was\nto be used, and he was to find her ceiling. He saw what the others\nwere getting, and he flew himself through on a jet of pure oxygen--\"\nHe stopped in utter admiration of the quickness of thought that could\noutwit death in an instant like that.\n\nThey carried the limp body to the light. \"No bones broken so far as I\ncan see,\" said the voice of Professor Sykes. \"Leave him here in the\nair. He must have got a whiff of their devilish mist in spite of his\noxygen; he was flying mighty awkwardly when he came in here.\"\n\nBut he was alive!--and Lieutenant McGuire hastened with all speed now\nto the room where a telephone was ringing wildly and a colonel of the\nair force must be told of the annihilation of a crack squadron and of\na threat that menaced all the world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn that far room there were others waiting where Colonel Boynton sat\nwith receiver to his ear. A general's uniform was gleaming in the\nlight to make more sober by contrast the civilian clothing of that\nquiet, clear-eyed man who held the portfolio of the Secretary of War.\n\nThey stared silently at Colonel Boynton, and they saw the blood recede\nfrom his face, while his cool voice went on unmoved with its replies.\n\n\"... I understand,\" he said; \"a washout, complete except for Captain\nBlake; his oxygen saved him.... It attacked with gas, you say?... And\nwhy did not our own planes escape?... Its speed!--yes, we'll have to\nimagine it, but it is unbelievable. One moment--\" He turned to those\nwho waited for his report.\n\n\"The squadron,\" he said with forced quiet, though his lips twitched in\na bloodless line, \"--the 91st--is destroyed. The enemy put them down\nwith one blow; enveloped them with gas.\" He recounted the essence of\nMcGuire's report, then turned once more to the phone.\n\n\"Hello, Lieutenant--the enemy ship--where is it now?\"\n\nHe listened--listened--to a silent receiver: silent save for the sound\nof a shot--a crashing fall--a loud, panting breath. He heard the\nbreathing close to the distant instrument; it ended in a choking gasp;\nthe instrument was silent in his ear....\n\nHe signalled violently for the operator: ordered the ringing of any\nand all phones about the observatory, and listened in vain for a sound\nor syllable in reply.\n\n\"A plane,\" he told an orderly, \"at once! Phone the commercial flying\nfield near the base of Mount Lawson. Have them hold a car ready for\nme: I shall land there!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTo Captain Blake alone, of all those persons on the summit of Mount\nLawson, it was given to see and to know and be able to relate what\ntranspired there and in the air above. For Blake, although he appeared\nlike one dead, was never unconscious throughout his experience.\n\nDriving head on toward the ship, he had emptied his drum of cartridges\nbefore he threw his plane over and down in a dive that escaped the\nonrush of the great craft by a scant margin, and that carried him down\nin company with the men and machines of the squadron that dived from\nabove.\n\nHe turned as they turned and climbed as they climbed for the advantage\nthat altitude might give. And he climbed faster: his ship outdistanced\nthem in that tearing, scrambling rush for the heights. The squadron\nwas spiraling upward in close formation with his plane above them when\nthe enemy struck.\n\nHe saw that great shape swing around them, terrible in its silent\nswiftness, and, like the others, he failed to realize at first the net\nshe was weaving. So thin was the gas and so rapid the circling of the\nenemy craft, they were captured and cut off inside of the gaseous\nsphere before the purpose of the maneuver was seen or understood.\n\nHe saw the first faint vapor form above him; swung over for a steep\nbank that carried him around the inside of the great cage of gas and\nthat showed him the spiraling planes as the first wisps of vapor swept\npast them.\n\nHe held that bank with his swift machine, while below him a squadron\nof close-formed fighting craft dissolved before his eyes into unguided\nunits. The formations melted: wings touched and locked; the planes\nfell dizzily or shot off in wild, ungoverned, swerving flight. The air\nwas misty about him; it was fragrant in his nostrils; the world was\nswimming....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was gas, he knew, and with the light-headedness that was upon him,\nso curiously like that of excessive altitudes, he reached\nunconsciously for the oxygen supply. The blast of pure gas in his face\nrevived him for an instant, and in that instant of clear thinking his\nplan was formed. He threw his weight on stick and rudder, corrected\nthe skid his ship was taking, and, with one hand holding the tube of\nlife-giving oxygen before his face, he drove straight down in a dive\ntoward the earth.\n\nThere were great weights fastened to his arm, it seemed, when he tried\nto bring the ship from her fearful dive. He moved only with greatest\neffort, and it was force of will alone that compelled his hands to do\ntheir work. His brain, as he saw the gleaming roundness of observatory\nbuildings beneath him, was as clear as ever in his life, but his\nmuscles, his arms and legs, refused to work: even his head; he was\nslowly sinking beneath a load of utter fatigue.\n\nThe observatories were behind him; he must swing back; he could not\nlast long, he knew; each slightest movement was intolerable effort.\n\nWas this death? he wondered; but his mind was so clear! There were the\nbuildings, the trees! How thickly they were massed beyond--\n\nHe brought every ounce of will power to bear ... the throttle!--and a\nslow glide in ... he was losing speed ... the stick--must--come--back!\nThe crashing branches whipped about him, bending, crackling--and the\nworld went dark....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were stars above him when he awoke, and his back was wrenched\nand aching. He tried to move, to call, but found that the paralysing\neffect of the gas still held him fast. He was lying on the ground, he\nknew: a door was open in a building beyond, and the light in the room\nshowed him men, a small group of them, standing silent while\nsomeone--yes, it was McGuire--shouted into a phone.\n\n\"... The squadron,\" he was saying. \"... Lost! Every plane down and\ndestroyed.... Blake is living but injured....\" And then Blake\nremembered. And the tumbling, helpless planes came again before his\neyes while he cursed silently at this freezing grip that would not let\nhim cover his face with his hands to shut out the sight.\n\nThe figure of a man hurried past him, nor saw the body lying helpless\nin the cool dark. McGuire was still at the phone. And the enemy\nship--?\n\nHis mind, filled with a welter of words as he tried to find phrases to\ncompass his hate for that ship. And then, as if conjured out of\nnothing by his thoughts, the great craft itself came in view overhead\nin all its mighty bulk.\n\nIt settled down swiftly: it was riding on an even keel. And in silence\nand darkness it came from above. Blake tried to call out, but no sound\ncould be formed by his paralyzed throat. Doors opened in silence,\nswinging down from the belly of the thing to show in the darkness\nsquare openings through which shot beams of brilliant yellow light.\n\nThere were cages that lowered--great platforms in slings--and the\nplatforms came softly to rest on the ground. They were moving with\nlife; living beings clustered upon them thick in the dark. Oh God! for\nan instant's release from the numbness that held his lips and throat\nto cry out one word!... The shapes were passing now in the shelter of\ndarkness, going toward the room.... He could see McGuire's back turned\ntoward the door.\n\nMan-shapes, tall and thin, distorted humans, each swathed in bulging\ngarments; horrible staring eyes of glass in the masks about their\nheads, and each hand ready with a shining weapon as they stood waiting\nfor the men within to move.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire must have seen them first, though his figure was half\nconcealed from Blake where he was lying. But he saw the head turn;\nknew by the quick twist of the shoulders the man was reaching for a\ngun. One shot echoed in Blake's ears; one bulging figure spun and fell\nawkwardly to the ground; then the weapons in those clumsy hands hissed\nsavagely while jets of vapor, half liquid and half gas, shot\nblindingly into the room. The faces dropped from his sight....\n\nThere had been the clamor of surprised and shouting men: there was\nsilence now. And the awkward figures in the bloated casings that\nprotected their bodies from the gas passed in safety to the room.\nBlake, bound in the invisible chains of enemy gas, struggled silently,\nfutilely, to pit his will against this grip that held him. To lie\nthere helpless, to see these men slaughtered! He saw one of the\ncreatures push the body of his fallen comrade out of the way: it was\ncast aside with an indifferent foot.\n\nThey were coming back: Blake saw the form of McGuire in unmistakable\nkhaki. He and another man were carried high on the shoulders of some\nof the invaders. They were going toward the platforms, the slings\nbeneath the ship.... They passed close to Blake, and again he was\nunnoticed in the dark.\n\nA clamor came from distant buildings, a babel of howls and shrieks,\ninhuman, unearthly. There were no phrases or syllables, but to Blake\nit was familiar ... somewhere he had heard it ... and then he\nremembered the radio and the weird wailing note that told of\ncommunication. These things were talking in the same discordant din.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were gathering now on the platforms slung under the ship. A\nwhistling note from somewhere within the great structure and the\nplatforms went high in the air. They were loaded, he saw, with papers\nand books and instruments plundered from the observatories. Some made\na second trip to take up the loot they had gathered. Then the black\ndoorways closed; the huge bulk of the ship floated high above the\ntrees; it took form, dwindled smaller and smaller, then vanished from\nsight in the star-studded sky.\n\nBlake thought of their unconscious passenger--the slim figure of\nLieutenant McGuire. Mac had been a close friend and a good one; his\nready smile; his steady eyes that could tear a problem to pieces with\ntheir analytic scrutiny or gaze far into space to see those visions of\na dreamer!\n\n\"Far into space.\" Blake repeated the words in his mind. And: \"Good-by\nMac,\" he said softly; \"you've shipped for a long cruise, I'm\nthinking.\" He hardly realized he had spoken the words aloud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLying there in the cold night he felt his strength returning slowly.\nThe pines sang their soothing, whispered message, and the faint night\nnoises served but to intensify the silence of the mountain. It was\nsome time before the grind of straining gears came faintly in the air\nto announce the coming of a car up the long grade. And still later he\nheard it come to a stop some distance beyond. There were footsteps,\nand voices calling: he heard the voice of Colonel Boynton. And he was\nable to call out in reply, even to move his head and turn it to see\nthe approaching figures in the night.\n\nColonel Boynton knelt beside him. \"Did they get you, old man?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Almost,\" Blake told him. \"My oxygen--I was lucky. But the others--\".\nHe did not need to complete the sentence. The silent canyons among\nthose wooded hills told plainly the story of the lost men.\n\n\"We will fight them with gas masks,\" said the colonel; \"your\nexperience has taught us the way.\"\n\n\"Gas-tight uniforms and our own supplies of oxygen,\" Blake\nsupplemented. He told Boynton of the man-things he had seen come from\nthe ship, of their baggy suits, their helmets.... And he had seen a\nsmall generator on the back of each helmet. He told him of the small,\nshining weapons and their powerful jets of gas. Deadly and unescapable\nat short range, he well knew.\n\n\"They got McGuire,\" Blake concluded; \"carried him off a prisoner. Took\nanother man, too.\"\n\nFor a moment Colonel Boynton's quiet tones lost their even steadiness.\n\"We'll get them,\" he said savagely, and it was plain that it was the\ninvaders that filled his mind; \"we'll go after them, and we'll get\nthem in spite of their damn gas, and we'll rip their big ship into\nribbons--\"\n\nCaptain Blake was able to raise a dissenting hand. \"We will have to go\nwhere they are, Colonel, to do that.\"\n\nColonel Boynton stared at him. \"Well?\" he demanded. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"We can't go where _they_ went,\" said Blake simply. \"I laughed at\nMcGuire; told him not to be a fool. But I was the fool--the blind one;\nwe all were, Colonel. That thing came here out of space. It has gone\nback; it is far beyond our air. I saw it go up out of sight, and I\nknow. Those creatures were men, if you like, but no men that we\nknow--not those shrieking, wailing devils! And we're going to hear\nmore from them, now that they've found their way here!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nA score of bodies where men had died in strangling fumes in the\nobservatories on Mount Lawson; one of the country's leading\nastronomical scientists vanished utterly; the buildings on the\nmountain top ransacked; papers and documents blowing in vagrant winds;\ntales of a monster ship in the air, incredibly huge, unbelievably\nswift--\n\nThere are matters that at times are not allowed to reach the press,\nbut not happenings like these. And the papers of the United States\nblazed out with headlines to tell the world of this latest mystery.\n\nThen came corroboration from the far corners of the world. The mystery\nship had not visited one section only; it had made a survey of the\nwhole civilized sphere, and the tales of those who had seen it were no\nlonger laughed to scorn but went on the wires of the great press\nagencies to be given to the world. And with that the censorship\nimposed by the Department of War broke down, and the tragic story of\nthe destruction of the 91st Air Squadron passed into written history.\nThe wild tale of Captain Blake was on every tongue.\n\nAn invasion from space! The idea was difficult to accept. There were\nscoffers who tried to find something here for their easy wit. Why\nshould we be attacked? What had that other world to gain? There was no\nanswer ready, but the silent lips of the men who had fallen spoke\neloquently of the truth. And the world, in wonder and consternation,\nwas forced to believe.\n\nWere there more to come? How meet them? Was this war--and with whom?\nWhat neighboring planet could reasonably be suspected. What had\nscience to say?\n\nThe scientists! The scientists! The clamor of the world was beating at\nthe doors of science and demanding explanations and answers. And\nscience answered.\n\nA conference was arranged in London; the best minds in the realms of\nastronomy and physics came together. They were the last to admit the\ntruth that would not be denied, but admit it they must. And to some of\nthe questions they found their answer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not Mars, they said, though this in the popular mind was the\nsource of the trouble. Not Mars, for that planet was far in the\nheavens. But Venus!--misnamed for the Goddess of Love. It was Venus,\nand she alone, who by any stretch of the imagination could be\nthreatening Earth.\n\nWhat did it mean? They had no answer. The ship was the only answer to\nthat. Would there be more?--could we meet them?--defeat them? And\nagain the wise men of the world refused to hazard a guess.\n\nBut they told what they knew; that Venus was past her eastern\nelongation, was approaching the earth. She of all the planets that\nswung around the sun came nearest to Earth--twenty-six million miles\nin another few weeks. Then whirling away she would pass to the western\nelongation in a month and a half and drive out into space. Venus\ncircled the sun in a year of 225 days, and in 534 days she would again\nreach her eastern elongation with reference to the earth, and draw\nnear us again.\n\nThey were reluctant to express themselves, these men who made nothing\nof weighing and analyzing stars a million of light years away, but\n_if_ the popular conception was correct and _if_ we could pass through\nthe following weeks without further assault, we could count on a year\nand a half before the menace would again return. And in a year and a\nhalf--well, the physicists would be working--and we might be prepared.\n\nCaptain Blake had made his report, but this, it seemed, was not\nenough. He was ordered to come to Washington, and, with Colonel\nBoynton, he flew across the country to tell again his incredible\nstory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a notable gathering before which he appeared. All the branches\nof the service were represented; there were men in the uniform of\nadmirals and generals; there were heads of Departments. And the\nSecretary of War was in charge.\n\nHe told his story, did Blake, before a battery of hostile eyes. This\nwas not a gathering to be stampeded by wild scareheads, nor by popular\nclamor. They wanted facts, and they wanted them proved. But the\ngravity with which they regarded the investigation was shown by their\ninvitation to the representatives of foreign powers to attend.\n\n\"I have told you all that happened,\" Blake concluded, \"up to the\ncoming of Colonel Boynton. May I reiterate one fact? I do not wonder\nat your questioning my state of mind and my ability to observe\ncorrectly. But I must insist, gentlemen, that while I got a shot of\ntheir gas and my muscles and my nervous system were paralyzed, my\nbrain was entirely clear. I saw what I saw; those creatures were\nthere; they entered the buildings; they carried off Lieutenant McGuire\nand another man.\n\n\"What they were or who they were I cannot say. I do not know that they\nwere men, but their insane shrieking in that queer unintelligible talk\nis significant. And that means of communication corresponds with the\nradio reception of which you know.\n\n\"If you gentlemen know of any part of this earth that can produce such\na people, if you know of any people or country in this world that can\nproduce such a ship--then we can forget all our wild fancies. And we\ncan prepare to submit to that country and that people as the masters\nof this earth. For I must tell you, gentlemen, with all the\nearnestness at my command, that until you have seen that ship in\naction, seen its incredible speed, its maneuverability, its\nlightning-like attack and its curtain of gas, you can have no\nconception of our helplessness. And the insignia that she carries is\nthe flag of our conquerors.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlake got an approving nod from the Secretary of War as he took his\nseat. That quiet man rose slowly from his chair to add his words. He\nspoke earnestly, impressively.\n\n\"Captain Blake has hit the nail squarely on the head,\" he stated. \"We\nhave here in this room a representative gathering from the whole\nworld. If there is any one of you who can say that this mystery ship\nwas built and manned by your people, let him speak, and we will send\nyou at once a commission to acknowledge your power and negotiate for\npeace.\"\n\nThe great hall was silent, in a silence that held only uneasy\nrustlings as men glanced one at another in wondering dismay.\n\n\"The time has come,\" said the Secretary with solemn emphasis, \"when\nall dissensions among our peoples must cease. Whatever there is or\never has been of discord between us fades into insignificance before\nthis new threat. It is the world, now, against a power unknown; we can\nonly face it as a united world.\n\n\"I shall recommend to the President of the United States that a\ncommission be appointed, that it may co-operate with similar bodies\nfrom all lands. I ask you, gentlemen, to make like representations to\nyour governments, to the end that we may meet this menace as one\ncountry and one man; meet it, God grant, successfully through a War\nDepartment of the World.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a brave gesture of the President of the United States; he dared\nthe scorn and laughter of the world in standing behind his Secretary\nof War. The world is quick to turn and rend with ridicule a false\nprophet. And despite the unanswerable facts, the scope and power of\nthe menace was not entirely believed. It was difficult for the\nconscious minds of men to conceive of the barriers of vast space as\nswept aside and the earth laid open to attack.\n\nEngland was slow to respond to the invitation of the President: this\nmatter required thought and grave deliberation in parliament. It might\nnot be true: the thought, whether spoken or unexpressed, was clinging\nto their minds. And even if true--even if this lone ship had wandered\nin from space--there might be no further attack.\n\n\"Why,\" they asked, \"should there be more unprovoked assaults from the\npeople of another planet? What was their object? What had they to\ngain? ... Perhaps we were safe after all.\" The answer that destroyed\nall hope came to them borne in upon a wall of water that swept the\nBritish coast.\n\nThe telescopes of the world were centered now on just one object in\nthe heavens. The bright evening star that adorned the western sky was\nthe target for instruments great and small. It was past the half-moon\nphase now, and it became under magnification a gleaming crescent, a\ncrescent that emitted from the dark sphere it embraced vivid flashes\nof light. Sykes' report had ample corroboration; the flash was seen by\nmany, and it was repeated the next night and the next.\n\nWhat was it? the waiting world asked. And the answer came not from the\ntelescopes and their far-reaching gaze but from the waters of the\nAtlantic. In the full blaze of day came a meteor that swept to the\nearth in an arc of fire to outshine the sun. There must have been\nthose who saw it strike--passengers and crews of passing ships--but\nits plunge into the depths of the Atlantic spelled death for each\nwitness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe earth trembled with the explosion that followed. A gas--some new\ncompound that united with water to give volumes tremendous--that only\ncould explain it. The ocean rose from its depths and flung wave after\nwave to race outward in circles of death.\n\nHundreds of feet in height at their source--this could only be\nestimated--they were devastating when they struck. The ocean raged\nover the frail bulwark of England in wave upon wave, and, retreating,\nthe waters left smooth, shining rock where cities had been. The stone\nand steel of their buildings was scattered far over the desolate land\nor drawn in the suction of retreating waters to the sea.\n\nIreland, too, and France and Spain. Even the coast of America felt the\nshock of the explosion and was swept by tidal waves of huge\nproportions. But the coast of Britain took the blow at its worst.\n\nThe world was stunned and waiting--waiting!--when the next blow fell.\nThe flashes were coming from Venus at regular intervals, just twenty\nhours and nineteen minutes apart. And with exactly the same time\nintervals the bolts arrived from space to lay waste the earth.\n\nThey struck where they would: the ocean again; the Sahara; in the\nmountains of China; the Pacific was thrown into fearful convulsions;\nthe wheat fields of Canada trembled and vanished before a blast of\nflaming gas....\n\nTwenty hours and nineteen minutes! Where it would strike, the next\nstar-shell, no man might say; that it surely would come was a deadly\nand nerve-shattering certainty. The earth waited and prayed under\nactual bombardment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome super-gun, said science with conviction; a great bore in the\nplanet itself, perhaps. But it was fixed, and the planet itself aimed\nwith an accuracy that was deadly; aimed once as each revolution\nbrought its gun on the target. Herein, said science, lay a basis for\nhope.\n\nIf, in that distant world, there was only one such bore, it must be\naltering its aim as the planet approached; the gun must cease to bear\nupon the earth. And the changing sweep of the missiles' flight\nconfirmed their belief.\n\nEach meteor-shell that came rushing into Earth's embrace burned\nbrilliantly as it tore into the air. And each flaming arc was\nincreasingly bent, until--twenty hours and nineteen minutes had\npassed--twenty minutes--thirty--another hour ... and the peoples of\nEarth dropped humbly to their knees in thankful prayer, or raised\nvengeful eyes and clenched fists toward the heavens while their\nquivering lips uttered blasphemous curses. The menace, for the time,\nhad passed; the great gun of Venus no longer was aiming toward the\nearth.\n\n\"No more ships,\" was the belief; \"not this time.\" And the world turned\nto an accounting of its losses, and to wonder--wonder--what the\nplanet's return would bring. A year and one half was theirs; one year\nand a half in which to live in safety, in which to plan and build.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA column, double leaded, in the _London Times_ voiced the feeling of\nthe world. It was copied and broadcast everywhere.\n\n\"Another attack,\" it concluded, \"is not a probability--it is a\ncertainty. They are destroying us for some reason known only to\nthemselves. Who can doubt that when the planet returns there will be a\nfurther bombardment; an invasion by armed forces in giant ships; bombs\ndropped from them miles high in the air. This is what we must look\nforward to--death and destruction dealt out by a force we are unable\nto meet.\n\n\"Our munitions factories may build larger guns, but can they reach the\nheights at which these monster ships of space will lie, with any faint\nprobability of inflicting damage? It is doubtful.\n\n\"Our aircraft is less than useless; its very name condemns it as\ninept. Craft of the air!--and we have to war against space ships which\ncan rise beyond the thin envelope of gas that encircles the earth.\n\n\"The world is doomed--utterly and finally doomed; it is the end of\nhumankind; slavery to a conquering race at the very best, unless--\n\n\"Let us face the facts fairly. It is war--war to the death--between\nthe inhabitants of this world and of that other. We are men. What they\nare God alone can say. But they are creatures of mind as are we; what\nthey have done, we may do.\n\n\"There is our only hope. It is vain, perhaps--preposterous in its\nassumption--but our sole and only hope. We must meet the enemy and\ndefeat him, and we must do it on his own ground. To destroy their\nfleet we must penetrate space; to silence their deadly bombardment we\nmust go out into space as they have done, reach their distant world\nas they have reached ours, and conquer as we would have been\nconquered.\n\n\"It is a tenuous hope, but our only one. Let our men of mundane\nwarfare do their best--it will be useless. But if there be one spark\nof God-given genius in the world that can point the way to victory,\nlet those in authority turn no deaf ear.\n\n\"It is a battle now of minds, and the best minds will win. Humanity--all\nhumankind--is facing the end. In less than one year and a half we must\nsucceed--or perish. And unless we conquer finally and decisively, the story\nof man in the history of the universe will be a tale that is told, a record\nof life in a book that is ended--closed--and forgotten through all\neternity.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA breath of a lethal gas shot from the flying ship had made Captain\nBlake as helpless as if every muscle were frozen hard, and he had got\nit only lightly, mixed with the saving blast of oxygen. His heart had\ngone on, and his breathing, though it became shallow, did not cease;\nhe was even able to turn his eyes. But to the men in the observatory\nroom the gas from the weapons of the attacking force came as a\ndevastating, choking cloud that struck them senseless as if with a\nblow. Lieutenant McGuire hardly heard the sound of his own pistol\nbefore unconsciousness took him.\n\nIt was death for the men who were left--for them the quick darkness\nnever lifted--but for McGuire and his companion there was reprieve.\n\nHe was lying flat on a hard floor when remembrance crept slowly back\nto his benumbed brain. An odor, sickish-sweet, was in his nostrils;\nthe breath of life was being forcibly pumped and withdrawn from\nlaboring lungs; a mask was tight against his face. He struggled to\nthrow it off, and someone bending over removed it.\n\nSomeone! His eyes stared wonderingly at the grotesque face like a\nlingering phantasm of fevered dreams. There were others, he saw, and\nthey were working over a body not far away upon the floor. He\nrecognized the figure of Professor Sykes. Short, stocky, his clothes\ndisheveled--but Sykes, unmistakably, despite the mask upon his face.\n\nHe, too, revived as McGuire watched, and, like the flyer, he looked\nwonderingly about him at his strange companions. The eyes of the two\nmet and held in wordless communication and astonishment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe unreal creatures that hovered near withdrew to the far side of the\nroom. The walls beyond them were of metal, white and gleaming; there\nwere doorways. In another wall were portholes--round windows of thick\nglass that framed circles of absolute night. It was dark out beyond\nthem with a blackness that was relieved only by sharp pin-points of\nbrilliance--stars in a night sky such as McGuire had never seen.\n\nPast and present alike were hazy to the flyer; the spark of life had\nbeen brought back to his body from a far distance; there was time\nneeded to part the unreal from the real in these new and strange\nsurroundings.\n\nThere were doorways in the ceiling, and others in the floor near where\nhe lay; ladders fastened to the wall gave access to these doors. A\ngrotesque figure appeared above the floor and, after a curious glance\nat the two men, scrambled into the room and vanished through the\nopening in the ceiling. It was some time before the significance of\nthis was plain to the wondering man--before he reasoned that he was in\nthe enemy ship, aimed outward from the earth, and the pull of\ngravitation and the greater force of the vessel's constant\nacceleration held its occupants to the rear walls of each room. That\nlanky figure had been making its way forward toward the bow of the\nship. McGuire's mind was clearing; he turned his attention now to the\ncurious, waiting creatures, his captors.\n\nThere were five of them standing in the room, five shapes like men,\nyet curiously, strangely, different. They were tall of stature, narrow\nacross the shoulders, muscular in a lean, attenuated fashion. But\ntheir faces! McGuire found his eyes returning in horrified fascination\nto each hideous, inhuman countenance.\n\nA colorless color, like the dead gray of ashes; a skin like that of an\nAfrican savage from which all but the last vestige of color had been\ndrained. It was transparent, parchment-like, and even in the light of\nthe room that glowed from some hidden source, he could see the\nthrobbing lines of blood-vessels that showed livid through the\ntranslucent skin. And he remembered, now, the fingers, half-seen in\nhis moments of awakening--they were like clinging tendrils, colorless,\ntoo, in that ashy gray, and showed the network of veins as if each\nhand had been flayed alive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe observer found himself analyzing, comparing, trying to find some\nearthly analogy for these unearthly creatures. Why did he think of\npotatoes sprouting in a cellar? What possible connection had these\nhalf-human things with that boyhood recollection? And he had seen some\nlaboratory experiments with plants and animals that had been cut off\nfrom the sunlight--and now the connection was clear; he knew what this\nidea was that was trying to form.\n\nThese were creatures of the dark. These bleached, drained faces showed\nskin that had never known the actinic rays of the sun; their whole\nframework proclaimed the process that had been going on through\ncountless generations. Here was a race that had lived, if not in\nabsolute darkness, then in some place where sunlight never shone--a\nplace of half-light--or of clouds.\n\n\"Clouds!\" The exclamation was startled from him. And: \"Clouds!\" he\nrepeated meditatively; he was seeing again a cloud-wrapped world in\nthe eye-piece of a big refracting telescope. \"Blanketed in clouds,\"\nProfessor Sykes had said. The scientist himself was speaking to him\nnow in bewildered tones.\n\n\"Clouds?\" he inquired. \"That's a strange remark to make. Where are we,\nLieutenant McGuire? I remember nothing after you fired. Are we\nflying--in the clouds?\"\n\n\"A long, long way beyond them, is my guess,\" said McGuire grimly. It\nwas staggering what all this might mean; there was time needed for\nfuller comprehension. But the lean bronzed face of the flyer flushed\nwith animation, and in spite of the terrors that must surely lie ahead\nhe felt strangely elated at the actuality of an incredible adventure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly he got to his feet to find that his muscles still were\nreluctant to respond to orders; he helped the professor to arise. And\nfrom the group that drew back further into the far end of the room\ncame a subdued and rasping tumult of discordant sound.\n\nOne, seemingly in charge, held a weapon in his hand, a slender tube no\nthicker than a common wire; and ending in a cylinder within the\ncreature's hand. He pointed it in threatening fashion while his voice\nrose in a shrill call. McGuire and Professor Sykes stood quiet and\nwaited for what the next moment might have in store, but McGuire waved\nthe weapon aside in a gesture that none could fail to read.\n\n\"Steady,\" he told his companion. \"We're in a ticklish position. Do\nnothing to alarm them.\"\n\nFrom up above them came an answering shrill note. Another of the\nbeings was descending into the room.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Lieutenant McGuire softly, \"the big boss, himself. Now\nlet's see what will happen.\"\n\nIf there had seemed something of timidity in the repulsive faces of\nthe waiting creatures, this newcomer was of a different type. He\nopened flabby thin lips to give one sharp note of command. It was as\nsibilant as the hissing of a snake. The man with the weapon returned\nit to a holder at his side; the whole group cringed before the power\nand authority of the new arrival.\n\nThe men that they had seen thus far were all garbed alike; a\nloose-fitting garment of one piece that was ludicrously like the play\nrompers that children might wear. These were dull red in color, the\nred of drying blood, made of strong woven cloth. But this other was\nuniformed differently.\n\nMcGuire noted the fineness of the silky robe. Like the others this was\nmade of one piece, loosely fitting, but its bright vivid scarlet made\nthe first seem drab and dull. A belt of metal about his waist shone\nlike gold and matched the emblem of precious metal in the turban on\nhis head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this the eyes of the flyer took in at a glance; his attention was\nonly momentarily diverted from the ashen face with eyes narrow and\nslitted, that stared with the cold hatred of a cat into those of the\nmen.\n\nHe made a sound with a whistling breath. It seemed to be a question\ndirected to them, but the import of it was lost.\n\n\"An exceedingly queer lot,\" Professor Sykes observed. \"And this chap\nseems distinctly hostile.\"\n\n\"He's no friend of mine,\" said McGuire as the thin, pendulous lips\nrepeated their whistling interrogation.\n\n\"I can't place them,\" mused the scientist. \"Those facial\ncharacteristics.... But they must be of some nationality, speak some\ntongue.\"\n\nHe addressed himself to the figure with the immobile, horrid face.\n\n\"We do not understand you,\" he said with an ingratiating smile.\n\"_Comprenez vous Francaise?_... _Non?_\"... German, perhaps, or\nSpanish?... \"_Sprecken sie Deutsche?_ _Usted habla Espa\u00f1ola?_...\"\n\nHe followed with a fusillade of questions in strange and varying\ntongues. \"I've even tried him with Chinese,\" he protested in\nbewilderment and stared amazed at his companion's laughter.\n\nThere had to be a reaction from the strain of the past hours, and\nLieutenant McGuire found the serious questioning in polyglot tongues\nand the unchanging feline stare of that hideous face too much for his\nmental restraint. He held his sides, while he shook and roared with\nlaughter beyond control, and the figure before him glared with evident\ndisapproval of his mirth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a hissing order, and two figures from the corner sprang\nforward to seize the flyer with long clinging fingers. Their strength\nhe had overestimated, for a violent throw of his body twisted him\nfree, and his outstretched hands sent the two sprawling across the\nroom. Their leader took one quick step forward, then paused as if\nhesitating to meet this young adversary.\n\n\"Do go easy,\" Professor Sykes was imploring. \"We do not know where we\nare nor who they are, but we must do nothing to antagonize them.\"\n\nMcGuire had reacted from his hilarious seizure with an emotional swing\nto the opposite extreme. \"I'll break their damn necks,\" he growled,\n\"if they get rough with me.\" And his narrow eyes exchanged glare for\nglare with those in the face like blood and ashes before him.\n\nThe cold cat eyes held steadily upon him while the scarlet figure\nretreated. A louder call, shrill and vibrant, came from the thin lips,\nand a swarm of bodies in dull red were scrambling into the room to\nmass about their scarlet leader. Above and behind them the face under\nits brilliant turban and golden clasp was glaring in triumph.\n\nThe tall figures crouched, grotesque and awkward; their long arms and\nhands with grasping, tendril-like fingers were ready. McGuire waited\nfor the sharp hissing order that would throw these things upon him,\nand he met the attack when it came with his own shoulders dropped to\nthe fighter's pose, head drawn in close and both fists swinging free.\n\nThere were lean fingers clutching at his throat, a press of blood-red\nbodies thick about him, and a clustering of faces where color blotched\nand flowed.\n\nThe thud of fists in blows that started from the floor was new to\nthese lean creatures that clawed and clung like cats. But they\ntrampled on those who went down before the flyer's blows and stood\nupon them to spring at his head; they crowded in in overwhelming\nnumbers while their red hands tore and twined about his face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was no place now for long swings; McGuire twisted his body and\nthrew his weight into quick short jabs at the faces before him. He was\nclear for an instant and swung his heavy boot at something that clung\nto one leg; then met with a rain of hooks and short punches the faces\nthat closed in again. He saw in that instant a wild whirl of bodies\nwhere the stocky figure of Professor Sykes was smothered beneath his\ntaller antagonists. But the professor, if he was forgetting the\nscience of the laboratory, was remembering that of the squared\ncircle--and the battle was not entirely one sided.\n\nMcGuire was free; the blood was trickling down his face from\ninnumerable cuts where sharp-nailed fingers had sunk deep. He wiped\nthe red stream from his eyes and threw himself at the weaving mass of\nbodies that eddied about Sykes in frantic struggle across the room.\n\nThe face of the professor showed clear for a moment. Like McGuire he\nwas bleeding, and his breath came in short explosive gasps, but he was\nholding his own! The eyes of McGuire glimpsed a wildly gesticulating,\nshouting figure in the rear. The face, contorted with rage, was almost\nthe color of the brilliant scarlet that the creature wore. The\nblood-stained man in khaki left his companion to fight his own battle,\nand plunged headlong at a leaping cluster of dull red, smashed through\nwith a frenzied attack of straight rights and lefts, and freed himself\nto make one final leap at the leader of this unholy pack.\n\nHe was fighting in blind desperation now; the two were out-numbered by\nthe writhing, lean-bodied creatures, and this thing that showed in\nblurred crimson before him was the directing power of them all. The\nfigure symbolized and personified to the raging man all the repulsive\nugliness of the leaping horde. The face came clear before him through\nthe mist of blood, and he put the last ounce of his remaining strength\nand every pound of weight behind a straight, clean drive with his\nright fist.\n\nHis last conscious impression was of a red, clawing hand that was\nclosed around the thick butt of a tube of steel ... then down, and\nstill down, he plunged into a bottomless pit of whirling, red flashes\nand choking fumes....\n\nThere were memories that were to occur to Lieutenant McGuire\nafterward--visions, dim and hazy and blurred, of half-waking moments\nwhen strange creatures forced food and water into his mouth, then held\na mask upon his face while he resisted weakly the breathing of sweet,\nsickly fumes that sent him back to unconsciousness.\n\nThere were many such times; some when he came sufficiently awake to\nknow that Sykes was lying near him, receiving similar care. Their\nlives were being preserved: How, or why, or what life might hold in\nstore he neither knew nor cared; the mask and the deep-drawn fumes\nbrought stupor and numbness to his brain.\n\nA window was in the floor beside him when he awoke--a circular window of\nthick glass or quartz. But no longer did it frame a picture of a sky in\nvelvet blackness; no unwinking pin-points of distant stars pricked keenly\nthrough the night; but, clear and dazzling, came a blessed radiance that\ncould mean only sunshine. A glowing light that was dazzling to his\nsleep-filled eyes, it streamed in golden--beautiful--to light the\nunfamiliar room and show motionless upon the floor the figure of Professor\nSykes. His torn clothing had been neatly arranged, and his face showed\nlivid lines of healing cuts and bruises.\n\nMcGuire tried gingerly to move his arms and legs; they were still\nfunctioning though stiff and weak from disuse. He raised himself\nslowly and stood swaying on his feet, then made his uncertain way to\nhis companion and shook him weakly by the shoulder.\n\nProfessor Sykes breathed deeply and raised leaden lids from tired eyes\nto stare uncomprehendingly at McGuire. Soon his dark pupils ceased to\ndilate, and he, too, could see their prison and the light of day.\n\n\"Sunlight!\" he said in a thin voice, and he seemed to know now that\nthey were in the air; \"I wonder--I wonder--if we shall land--what\ncountry? ... Some wilderness and a strange race--a strange, strange\nrace!\"\n\nHe was muttering half to himself; the mystery of these people whom he\ncould not identify was still troubling him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire helped the other man to his feet, and they clung to each to\nthe other for support as they crossed to kneel beside the floor-window\nand learn finally where their captors meant to take them.\n\nA wilderness, indeed, the sight that met their eyes, but a wilderness\nof clouds--no unfamiliar sight to Lieutenant McGuire of the United\nStates Army air service. But to settle softly into them instead of\ndriving through with glistening wings--this was new and vastly\ndifferent from anything he had known.\n\nSounds came to them in the silence, penetrating faintly through thick\nwalls--the same familiar wailing call that trembled and quavered and\nseemed to the listening men to be guiding them down through the mist.\n\nGone was the sunlight, and the clouds beyond the deep-set window were\ngloriously ablaze with a brilliance softly diffused. The cloud bank\nwas deep, and they felt the craft under them sink slowly, steadily\ninto the misty embrace. It thinned below them to drifting vapor, and\nthe first hazy shadows of the ground showed through from far beneath.\nTheir altitude, the flyer knew, was still many thousands of feet.\n\n\"Water,\" said McGuire, as his trained eyes made plain to him what was\nstill indistinct to the scientist. \"An ocean--and a shore-line--\" More\nclouds obscured the view; they parted suddenly to show a portion only\nof a clear-cut map.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt stretched beyond the confines of their window, that unfamiliar line\nof wave-marked shore; the water was like frozen gold, wrinkled in\ncountless tiny corrugations and reflecting the bright glow from above.\nBut the land,--that drew their eyes!\n\nWere those cities, those shadow-splashed areas of gray and rose?...\nThe last veiling clouds dissolved, and the whole circle was plain to\ntheir view.\n\nThe men leaned forward, breathless, intent, till the scientist,\nSykes--the man whose eyes had seen and whose brain recorded a dim\nshape in the lens of a great telescope--Sykes drew back with a\nquivering, incredulous breath. For below them, so plain, so\nunmistakable, there lay an island, large even from this height, and it\nformed on this round map a sharp angle like a great letter \"L.\"\n\n\"We shall know that if we ever see it again,\" Professor Sykes had\nremarked in the quiet and security of that domed building surmounting\nthe heights of Mount Lawson. But he said nothing now, as he stared at\nhis companion with eyes that implored McGuire to arouse him from this\nsleep, this dream that could never be real. But McGuire, lieutenant\none-time in the forces of the U. S. A., had seen it too, and he stared\nback with a look that gave dreadful confirmation.\n\nThe observatory--Mount Lawson--the earth!--those were the things\nunreal and far away. And here before them, in brain-stunning\nactuality, were the markings unmistakable--the markings of Venus. And\nthey were landing, these two, in the company of creatures wild and\nstrange as the planet--on Venus itself!\n\n(_To be continued._)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Advertisement: ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Destroyer\n\n_By William Merriam Rouse_\n\n[Illustration: \"The connection is made,\" murmured Von Stein.]\n\n[Sidenote: Slowly, insidiously, there stole over Allen Parker\nsomething uncanny. He could no longer control his hands--even his\nbrain!]\n\nThe pencil in the hand of Allen Parker refused to obey his will. A\nstrange unseen force pushed his will aside and took possession of the\npencil point so that what he drew was not his own. It was the same\nwhen he turned from drawing board to typewriter. The sentences were\nnot of his framing; the ideas were utterly foreign to him. This was\nthe first hint he received of the fate that was drawing in like night\nupon him and his beautiful wife.\n\nParker, a young writer of growing reputation who illustrated his own\nwork, was making a series of pencil sketches for a romance partly\nfinished. The story was as joyous and elusive as sunlight, and until\nto-day his sketches had held the same quality. Now he could not tap\nthe reservoir from which he had taken the wind-blown hair and smiling\neyes of Madelon, his heroine.\n\nWhen he drew or wrote he seemed to be submerged in the dark waters of\na measureless evil pit. The face that mocked him from the paper was\nstamped with a world-old knowledge of forbidden things.\n\nParker dropped his pencil and leaned back, tortured. He and his wife,\nBetty, had taken this house in Pine Hills, a small and extremely\nquiet suburban village, solely for the purpose of concentration on the\nbook which was to be the most important work he had done. He went to\nthe door of the room that he used for a studio and called:\n\n\"Betty! Can you come here a moment, please?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a patter of running feet on the stairs and then a girl of\ntwenty, or thereabout, came into the room. Any man would have said she\nwas a blessing. Her hair \"was yellow like ripe corn,\" and her vivid\nblue eyes held depth and character and charm.\n\n\"Look!\" exclaimed Parker. \"What do you think of this stuff?\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence. Then Allen Parker saw something he had\nnever before seen in his wife's face for him or his work--a look of\ncomplete disgust.\n\n\"I wouldn't have believed you capable of doing anything so ... so\nhorrid!\" she said coldly. \"How could you?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\" His arms, which had been ready to take her to him for\ncomfort, dropped. \"The work has been ... difficult, lately. As though\nsomething were pulling at my mind. But not like this! It isn't _me_!\"\n\n\"It must be you, since it came out of you!\" She turned away and moved\nrestlessly to one of the windows.\n\n\"Through me!\" muttered Parker. \"Ideas _come_!\"\n\n\"You'll have to do something!\"\n\n\"But what? I don't know what to do!\"\n\n\"Why not go to see that new doctor?\" asked Betty, over her shoulder.\n\"Dr. Friedrich von Stein?\"\n\n\"Von Stein?\" repeated Parker, vaguely. \"Don't know him. Anyhow, I\ndon't need a doctor. What in the world made you think of that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Nothing, except that I can see his house from here. He's taken what\nthey call 'the old Reynolds place.' You know--opposite the church. We\nlooked at it and thought it was too large for us. He's made a lot of\nalterations.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Parker had placed the newcomer, more recent than himself.\n\"I had an idea that he was a doctor of philosophy, not medicine.\"\n\n\"He has half a dozen degrees, they say. Certainly he's a stunning\nlooking man. I saw him on the street.\"\n\n\"Maybe he doesn't practice.\" The artist was gazing, baffled and sick\nat heart, upon what he had wrought. \"And what could he do, unless it's\nmy liver?\"\n\n\"He might be a psycho-analyst, or something like that,\" she replied,\nslowly.\n\n\"But why the wild interest in this particular doctor?\" Parker roused\nhimself and looked at her. He felt irritable, and was ashamed of it.\n\n\"Only for your work,\" said Betty. A faint pink touched her cheeks.\n\nAllen Parker had a sudden feeling of certainty that his wife was lying\nto him. To one who knew the Parkers it would have been equally\nimpossible to think of Betty as lying, or of her husband as believing\nsuch a thing. Parker was outraged by his own suspicion. He sprang up\nand began to pace the floor.\n\n\"All right, then!\" he exploded. \"My work is going to the dogs! Why,\nthere's an appointment with Cartwright to-morrow to show him these\nsketches, and the last few chapters I've done! We'll go now! If this\nman can't do anything for me I'll try somebody else!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn ten minutes they were walking up the quiet street toward the\npresent home of Dr. Friedrich von Stein. Despite his self-absorption\nParker could not help noticing that his wife had never looked more\nattractive than she did at this moment. Her color had deepened, little\nwisps of hair curled against her cheeks, and there was a sparkle in\nher eyes which he knew came only on very particular occasions.\n\nEven from the outside it was apparent that many strange things had\nbeen done to the staid and dignified house of Reynolds. A mass of\naerials hung above the roof. Some new windows had been cut at the\nsecond floor and filled with glass of a peculiar reddish-purple tinge.\nA residence had been turned into a laboratory, in sharp contrast to\nthe charming houses up and down the street and the church of gray\nstone that stood opposite.\n\nBeside the door, at the main entrance, a modest plate bore the legend:\n\"Dr. Friedrich von Stein.\" Parker pressed the bell. Then he squared\nhis broad shoulders and waited: a very miserable, very likeable young\nman, with a finely shaped head and a good set of muscles under his\nwell cut clothes. He had brought his sketches, but he was\nuncomfortable with the portfolio under his arm. It seemed to\ncontaminate him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door opened to reveal a blocky figure of a man in a workman's\nblouse and overalls. The fellow was pale of eye, towheaded; he\nappeared to be good natured but of little intelligence. The only\nremarkable thing about him was a livid welt that ran across one cheek,\nfrom nose to ear. Beside him a glossy-coated dachshund wagged\nfuriously, after having barked once as a matter of duty.\n\n\"May we see Dr. von Stein?\" asked Parker. \"If he is in?\"\n\n\"I will ask the Herr Doktor if he iss in,\" replied the man, stiffly.\n\n\"_Dummkopf!_\" roared a voice from inside the house. An instant later\nman and dog shrank back along the hall and there appeared in their\nplace one of the most striking personalities Allen Parker had ever\nseen.\n\nDr. Friedrich von Stein was inches more than six feet tall and he\nstood perfectly erect, with the unmistakable carriage of a well\ndrilled soldier. He was big boned, but lean, and every movement was\nmade with military precision. More than any other feature his eyes\nimpressed Parker: they were steady, penetrating, and absolutely black.\nBut for a thread of gray here and there his well-kept beard and hair\nwere black. He might have been any age from forty to sixty, so\ndeceptive was his appearance.\n\n\"Come in, if you please,\" he said, before Parker could speak. Von\nStein's voice was rich and deep, but with a metallic quality which\nsomehow corresponded with his mechanical smile. Except for the\nguttural r's there was hardly a hint of the foreigner in his speech.\n\"It is Mr. and Mrs. Parker, I believe? I am Dr. von Stein.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood aside for them to pass into the hallway, and while they\nmurmured their thanks he shot a volley of German at the man, whom he\ncalled Heinrich. The frightened servant vanished; and the Parkers were\ntaken into a living room furnished carelessly, but in good enough\ntaste. Betty took her place on a couch, to which the doctor led her\nwith a bow. Parker sank into an overstuffed chair not far from a\nwindow.\n\n\"I learned your names because of the beauty of madame,\" said Von\nStein, as he stood looming above the mantel. Again he bowed. \"One\ncould not see her without wishing to know how such a charming woman\nwas called. You are my neighbors from down the street, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Allen. He wanted to be agreeable, but found it\ndifficult. \"And I think Mrs. Parker has developed a great admiration\nfor you. She persuaded me to come here to-day. Are you, by chance, a\npsycho-analyst? I don't even know that you are a doctor of medicine,\nbut--\"\n\n\"I know a very great deal about the human mind,\" interrupted Dr. von\nStein calmly. \"I know a great deal about many things. I am not going\nto practice medicine here in Pine Hills because I have research work\nto do, but I will help you if I can. What is your trouble?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe question brought back to Parker the mood of half an hour ago.\nAlmost savagely he snapped the portfolio open and spread out a few of\nhis recent drawings, with some of the earlier ones for comparison.\n\n\"Look!\" he cried. \"These vicious things are what I am doing now! I\ncan't help myself! The pencil does not obey me! Apparently I have no\nemotional control. It's as though my normal ideas were shouldered\naside, like people in a crowd. And my writing to-day was as bad as\nthese illustrations. I'm doing a book. Consider these things\ncarefully, Doctor. They are not obscene, except by inference. They\ncan't be censored. The book would go through the mails. Yet they are\ndeadly! Look at my heroine in these two pictures. In one she is\nlike--like violets! In the other she looks capable of any crime! What\nis she? A vampire, if there is such a thing? A witch? I can almost\nbelieve in demonology since I made these last drawings!\"\n\nParker, in spite of his excitement, tried to read the face of Dr.\nFriedrich von Stein. He found nothing but the automatic smile upon\nthat mask. Yet it seemed to the artist that this time there was a hint\nof real pleasure in the curve of the lips. Was it possible that anyone\ncould like those drawings? Parker began to think that he was going\ninsane.\n\n\"This is most unfortunate for you,\" rumbled the doctor. \"I understand.\nBut I trust that the condition can be remedied, if it persists. You,\nMr. Parker, and you, Madame, do you understand something of physics,\nof psychology, of metaphysics?\"\n\n\"I fear that I'm rather ignorant,\" answered Betty. \"Certainly I am in\ncomparison with a man of your attainments.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. von Stein bowed. He turned his black eyes upon Parker.\n\n\"And you, sir? I must adjust my explanation to--what shall I say? To\nyour knowledge of the higher reaches of scientific thought?\"\n\n\"Why, I majored in philosophy in college,\" said Parker, hesitatingly.\n\"But that's quite a time ago, Herr Doktor. Of course I've tried to\nkeep up with the conclusions of science. But a writer or a painter\ndoesn't have any too much opportunity. He has his own problems to\nconcern him.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" Dr. von Stein was thoughtful. \"So, and especially for\nthe benefit of madame, I shall speak in terms of the concrete.\"\n\n\"Please consider me stupid!\" begged Betty. \"But I want to understand!\"\n\n\"Certainly, except that you are not stupid, Madame. I will proceed.\nBoth of you, I assume, know something of the radio? Very good! You\nknow that an etheric wave transmits the message, and that it is\nreceived and amplified so that it is within the range of the human\near. These waves were there when paleolithic man hunted his meat with\na stone-tipped club. To use them it was necessary to invent the\nmicrophone, and a receiving instrument.\n\n\"What I have said you already know. But here is what may startle you.\nHuman thought is an etheric wave of the same essential nature as the\nradio wave. They are both electrical currents external to man.\nThoughts sweep across the human mind as sound currents sweep across\nthe aerials of a radio--\"\n\n\"I told you!\" Allen Parker turned a triumphant face to his wife.\n\"Pardon me, Herr Doktor! I have tried to convince Mrs. Parker that my\nidea came from outside!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Exactly!\" Dr. von Stein took no offense. \"And a difference between\nthe mind and the radio set is that with the radio you tune in upon\nwhatever you choose, and when you choose. The mind is not under such\ncontrol, although it should be. It receives that to which it happens\nto be open. Or that thought which has been intensified and\nstrengthened by having been received and entertained by other minds.\nIn India they say: 'Five thousand died of the plague and fifty\nthousand died of fear.' Do you both follow me?\"\n\nIt was unnecessary to ask. Betty sat on the edge of the couch, intent\nupon every word. Parker, although more restrained, was equally\ninterested. Moreover he was delighted to have what he had felt\ninstinctively confirmed, in a way, by a man of science.\n\n\"Herbert Spencer said,\" continued the doctor, \"that no thought, no\nfeeling, is ever manifested save as the result of a physical force.\nThis principle will before long be a scientific commonplace. And\nHuxley predicted that we would arrive at a mechanical equivalent of\nconsciousness. But I will not attempt to bolster my position with\nauthorities. I know, and I can prove what I know.\n\n\"You, Mr. Parker, have been receiving some particularly annoying\nthoughts which have been intensified, it may be, by others, or\nanother. Human will power can alter the rate of vibration of the line\nof force, or etheric wave. So-called good thoughts have a high rate of\nvibration, and those which are called bad ordinarily have a low rate.\nHave you, perhaps, an enemy?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" replied Parker, in a low voice.\n\n\"Then it would follow that this is accidental.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Good heavens! Do you mean to say that someone could do this to me\nmaliciously?\"\n\n\"So far my experiments leave something to be desired,\" said Dr. von\nStein, without answering directly. \"No doubt you are peculiarly\nsusceptible to thoughts which bear in any way on your work.\"\n\n\"But isn't there any help for it?\" asked Betty. She was regarding her\nhusband with the eyes of a stranger.\n\n\"I believe I can do something for Mr. Parker.\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door. The doctor boomed an order to come in.\nHeinrich, with the dachshund at his heels, entered bearing a tray with\na bottle of wine and some slices of heavy fruit cake. He drew out a\ntable and placed the tray.\n\n\"Do not bring that dog in when I have guests,\" said Von Stein. He\nspoke with a gleam of white teeth. \"You know what will happen,\nHeinrich?\"\n\n\"_Ja_, Herr Doktor! I take Hans oudt!\" The man was terrified. He\ngathered the dog into his arms and fairly fled from the room. Dr. von\nStein turned with a smile.\n\n\"I have to discipline him,\" he explained. \"He's a stupid fellow, but\nfaithful. I can't have ordinary servants about. There are scientific\nmen who would be willing to bribe them for a look at my laboratory.\"\n\n\"I did not know such things were done among scholars,\" said Betty,\nslowly.\n\n\"What I have accomplished means power, Madame!\" exclaimed the doctor.\n\"There are jackals in every walk of life. If an unscrupulous man of\nscience got into my laboratory, a physicist for instance, he might ...\nfind out things!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. von Stein turned to his duties as host. He filled their glasses,\nand watched with satisfaction Betty's obvious enjoyment of the cake. A\nbox of mellow Havanas appeared from a cabinet: imported cigarettes\nfrom a smoking stand. But Parker, in spite of a liking for good wine\nand tobacco, was far too much concerned about his work to forget the\nerrand that had brought him there.\n\n\"So you think,\" he said, when there was opportunity, \"that you can\nhelp me, Dr. von Stein?\"\n\n\"I can,\" replied von Stein, firmly; \"but before attempting anything\nI'd like to wait a day or two. The attacking thoughts may become less\nviolent, or your resistance greater, in either of which cases the\ncondition will fade out. You will either get better or much worse. If\nyou are worse come to see me again, and I promise you that I will do\nsomething!\"\n\n\"I'll come, and thank you!\" Parker felt better, and more cheerful than\nhe had since the beginning of the disturbance. \"Few things could make\nme suffer so much as trouble with my work.\"\n\n\"That is what I thought,\" agreed Dr. von Stein.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBetty rose. Her husband caught the look in her eyes as they met the\nbright, black gaze of Dr. von Stein, and he went cold. That look had\nalways been for him alone. Her feet seemed to linger on the way to the\ndoor.\n\n\"He's wonderful!\" she breathed, as they started down the uneventful\nstreet. \"Scientific things never interested me before. But he makes\nthem vital, living!\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Parker, thoughtfully, \"there's something uncanny about\nthat man!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Betty. \"It's because he's a genius! Don't be\nsmall, Allen!\"\n\nParker gasped, and remained silent. He could not remember that his\nwife had ever spoken to him in quite that way. They finished the\nlittle journey home without speaking again and Parker went directly to\nstudio. He sat down, with drooping shoulders, and considered the mess\nhe had made of his book. Well, there was nothing to do but see\nCartwright to-morrow and face the music!\n\nDinner that night was a mournful affair. The soft footsteps of the\nservant going in and out of the dining room, the ticking of the clock,\nwere almost the only sounds. Betty was deep in her own thoughts;\nParker was too miserable to talk. He went to bed early and lay staring\ninto the darkness for what seemed like an eternity of slow moving\nhours.\n\nThe tall, deep voiced clock in the hall downstairs had just struck\none when suddenly Parker's room was flooded with light. He sat up,\nblinking, and saw Betty standing near his bed. Her fingers twisted\nagainst each other; her face was drawn and white.\n\n\"Allen!\" she whispered. \"I'm afraid!\"\n\nInstantly he was on his feet; his arms went around her and the yellow\nhead dropped wearily against his shoulder.\n\n\"Afraid of what?\" he cried. \"What is it, sweetheart?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\" All at once her body stiffened and she pulled away\nfrom him. Then she laughed--\"What nonsense! I must have been having a\nbad dream ... it's nothing. Sorry I bothered you, Allen!\"\n\nShe was gone before his could stop her. Bewildered, he did not know\nwhether to follow. Better not, he thought. She would sleep now, and\nperhaps he would. But he was worried. Betty was becoming less and less\nlike herself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last Parker did sleep, to awake shortly after daylight. He got a\nhasty breakfast and took an early train to New York. When John\nCartwright, a shrewd and kindly man well advanced in years, arrived at\nhis office Allen Parker was right there waiting for him.\n\nCartwright had shown a real affection for the younger man, a paternal\ninterest. He beamed, as usual, until he sat down with the new\ndrawings. Slowly the smile faded from his face. He went over them\ntwice, three times, and then he looked up.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said, \"did you do these?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know that you are turning a delicate and beautiful romance\ninto a lascivious libel on the human race?\"\n\n\"It is being done,\" replied Parker, in a low voice. \"And I--I can't\nhelp myself!\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean that when I start to draw Madelon my hand produces that woman\nof Babylon! The writing is just as bad. It's full of sneering hints,\ndouble meanings ... I shall destroy the stuff. I've been to see a\npsycho-analyst.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you're tired, Allen. Why not take Betty\nfor a sea trip? There'll still be time for fall publication.\"\n\n\"I'm going to try everything possible. I'd rather be dead than do work\nlike this!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Parker left his friend he was somewhat encouraged. After the\nfirst shock Cartwright had been inclined to make light of the\ndifficulty, and by the time Allen Parker reached Pine Hills his stride\nhad the usual swing and snap.\n\nHe ran up the steps of his house and burst into the living room with a\nsmile. Betty was sitting by one of the windows, her hands lying\nrelaxed in her lap. She turned a somber face toward her husband, and\nspoke before he had time to say a word of greeting.\n\n\"You knew that Cordelia Lyman died a short time ago, didn't you?\"\n\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed Parker, bewildered. \"Lyman? Oh, the old lady\ndown the street who left her money to found a home for aged spinsters?\nWhat about it?\"\n\n\"But she didn't leave her money to found a home for aged spinsters,\nAllen. She had said she was going to, and everybody thought so. Her\nwill was admitted to probate, or whatever they call it, yesterday. She\nleft half a million, all she had, to Dr. Friedrich von Stein, to be\nused as he thinks best for the advancement of science!\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" Parker stared. \"Why, I didn't know she knew him. He'd\nonly been here a week or so when she died.\"\n\n\"There isn't a flaw in the will, they say. You can imagine that Pine\nHills is talking!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Parker philosophically, \"he's lucky. I hope he does\nsomething with it.\"\n\n\"He will,\" replied Betty, with conviction. \"He'll do a great many\nthings!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nParker told her of his interview with Cartwright, but she seemed\nlittle interested. He did not try to work that day but, after he had\nput the offending drawings and manuscript out of sight, he wandered,\nread, smoked, and in the evening persuaded Betty to take a moonlight\nwalk with him.\n\nThey passed the house of Dr. von Stein, from which came a faint\nhumming that sounded like a dynamo. Across the street the church was\nalight for some service. Triumphant music drifted to them. The moon\nhung above the spire, with its cross outlined darkly against the\nbrilliant sky. The windows were great jewels. Betty drew a deep\nbreath.\n\n\"Sometimes, Allen,\" she said, \"I feel like praying!\"\n\n\"You _are_ a beautiful prayer,\" whispered Parker.\n\nShe walked close to him, holding his arm, and repeated softly:\n\n    \"Are not two prayers a perfect strength?\n      And shall I feel afraid?\"\n\nBut that was the end of that mood. By the time they arrived home Betty\nwas again the strange, aloof, cold, slightly hard woman of the past\nfew days. Again depression settled upon Allen Parker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning he breakfasted alone and went directly to the studio,\nwithout seeing Betty. Sun streamed into the room; the pencil moved\nswiftly. For a brief time Parker thought that he was himself again, as\nMadelon grew upon the block of paper. But the end was terrible. The\nlast few strokes made her grotesque. This time the woman he had drawn\nwas not merely evil; she was a mocking parody of his heroine. He threw\ndrawing and pencil across the room.\n\nBut no real artist can be discouraged short of death. He went to work\nagain and labored until luncheon time. The results were no better,\nalthough they varied. Now it seemed that some malevolent power was\nplaying with him, torturing him to the accompaniment of devilish\nlaughter. He was haggard and actually stooped of body when he bathed\nhis face and went down to the dining room. From across the table Betty\nregarded him curiously.\n\n\"Fleming Proctor shot himself last night,\" she announced, calmly.\n\"This morning they found him dead in his office.\"\n\n\"Proctor? You don't mean the president of the Pine Hills National\nBank?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The expression of Betty's face did not change. \"There was a\nnote saying that he was sorry. It seems he'd made a large loan without\nsecurity to an unknown person, and the bank examiner was coming\nto-day. Proctor said he couldn't help what he did. The note was\nconfused as though he were trying to tell something and couldn't. They\nthink his mind must have given way, particularly as they can't trace\nthe loan, although the money is undoubtedly gone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That kind of thing doesn't happen!\" Parker was stunned. He had known\nFleming Proctor, and liked him. They met often at the country club.\n\"Proctor was honest, and a fine business man!\"\n\n\"It did happen, Allen!\"\n\n\"I'd like to know more about it. That would have been a case for Dr.\nvon Stein to take in hand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Betty, in a voice like ice. \"But I'm more interested\nin finding out how soon you are going to return to normal. Frankly,\nI'm beginning to get bored.\"\n\nWithout a word Parker rose and left the room. Never before had his\nwife hurt him like this. Doubly sensitive just now, he was suffering\nalone in the studio when the telephone rang.\n\n\"Dr. von Stein speaking. Are you better, Mr. Parker?\"\n\n\"Worse! Much worse!\"\n\n\"Then come to my house this evening at nine. May I expect you? And\nalone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" There was much Parker wanted to say, but he choked the words\nback. \"I'll be there, and alone.\"\n\n\"I shall be ready for you. Good-by.\"\n\nAllen Parker hung up the receiver. He did not leave the studio again\nuntil evening.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Parker approached the house of Dr. Friedrich von Stein he saw that\nthe church was lighted as it had been the night before. In a clear sky\nthe moon rode above the spire. He paused to let his glance sweep up\nalong the beautiful line that ran from earth to the slender cross.\nThat was how he felt. He wanted to rise, as that line rose, from\ncumbering earth to clarity and beauty.\n\nHe mounted the steps and rang. Dr. von Stein met him, with eyes and\nteeth agleam in the hall light. Wearily Parker stepped inside. His\nmood of the moment before was fading.\n\n\"Go upstairs to my laboratory, if you please,\" said the doctor. \"It is\nbest that I see you there, for it may be that you will need\ntreatment.\"\n\n\"I need something,\" replied Parker as he went up a long flight of\nstairs. \"I'm in a bad way.\"\n\nWithout answer von Stein led him down a short corridor and held open a\ndoor. Allen Parker stepped into a room that bewildered him with its\nstrange contrasts.\n\nAt a glance he saw that nearly the whole upper floor of the building\nhad been converted into one gigantic room. Near a big stone fireplace,\nwhere burning driftwood sent up its many tinted flames, Heinrich stood\nrigidly at attention. Hans, the dachshund, crouched at his feet. When\nthe dog started to meet Parker a guttural command stopped him.\n\nHere there were bearskins on the floor, huge stuffed chairs,\nfootrests, little tables, humidors, pipe racks, all that one could\ndesire for comfort. Two German duelling swords were crossed above the\nmantel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut beyond this corner everything was different. Parker saw the massed\nwindows of reddish-purple glass; he saw apparatus for which he had no\nname, as well as some of the ordinary paraphernalia of the chemical\nlaboratory. There was wiring everywhere, and a multitude of lighting\nfixtures. Utilitarian tables, desks and chairs were placed about with\nmathematical precision. There were plates and strips of metal set into\nthe glass smooth flooring, which was broken by depressions and\nelevations of unusual form.\n\nThe most striking thing in the room was a huge copper bowl that hung\ninverted from the ceiling. In it, and extending down below the rim,\nwas what seemed to be a thick and stationary mist. It looked as though\nthe bowl had been filled with a silver gray mist and then turned\nbottom side up. But the cloud did not fall or float away.\n\n\"I can think and speak best from my desk,\" Von Stein was saying.\n\"Please sit down facing me in the chair which Heinrich will place for\nyou. Then we will talk.\"\n\nHeinrich rolled one of the overstuffed chairs noiselessly to a\nposition about six feet from the desk. Parker noticed a long metal\nstrip in the floor between him and the doctor.\n\nJust then Hans wriggled forward and the artist scratched his ears, to\nbe rewarded by a grateful tongue. Again a command from Heinrich\nbrought the dog to heel, but the voice was not so gruff this time.\nTogether they returned to the fireplace.\n\nVon Stein let his hands rest upon the desk top--a surface covered with\nlevers, electric switches, push buttons, and contrivances the nature\nof which Parker could not guess. The doctor leaned forward. He threw\nover a switch. The lights in the room became less bright. He pressed a\nbutton. The Danse Macabre of Saint-Saens floated weirdly upon the\nair, as though the music came from afar off.\n\n\"Is that part of the treatment?\" asked Parker, with a faint smile.\n\"It's not cheering, exactly.\"\n\n\"Merely an idiosyncrasy of mine,\" answered Von Stein, showing his\nteeth. \"Before anything is done I must, in order to aid the\nreceptivity of your mind, go a little further with the explanation of\ncertain things which I mentioned the other day. I promise not to bore\nyou. More than that, Mr. Parker, I promise that you will be more\ninterested than you have ever been in anything!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to Parker that there was something sinister in the manner\nand speech of Dr. von Stein. The Dance of Death! Did that music have a\nmeaning? Impossible! It was only his own sick mind that was allowing\nsuch thoughts to come to him.\n\n\"Anything that will help,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have noticed that copper bowl?\" Von Stein did not wait for a\nreply. \"The misty appearance inside and underneath it is given by\nthousands upon thousands of minute platinum wires. When it is in use a\nslight electrical current is passed through it, varying in power\naccording to the rate of vibration needed. That instrument, my dear\nsir, is a transmitter of thought. I may call it the microphone of the\nmind. I can tune in on any mind in the world, by experimenting up and\ndown the vibration range to determine the susceptibility of the\nparticular person. The human mind does not need an amplifier, as the\nradio receiving set does. Rather, it acts as its own amplifier, once\nhaving received the thought. I invented one, however, to prove that it\ncould be done. I equipped Heinrich with it and in half an hour by\nsuggestion reduced him to his present state of docile stupidity. I\nhave, Mr. Parker, the means of moving people to do my bidding!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVon Stein stopped abruptly, as though for emphasis and to allow his\nastounding statements to take effect. Parker sat stunned, struggling\nto grasp all the implications of what he had just heard. Suddenly they\nbecame clear. He saw events in order, and in relation to each other.\n\n\"So that's how it was with Cordelia Lyman!\" he cried hoarsely, leaning\nforward. \"And it was you who had that money from Fleming Proctor!\"\n\n\"You are not unintelligent,\" remarked Dr. von Stein. \"Better that\nscience should have the Lyman money than a few old women of no\nparticular use. As for Proctor, he was a fool. I would have protected\nhim.\"\n\n\"And my pictures ... my book....\"\n\n\"I can cure you, Mr. Parker. _If I will!_\"\n\n\"And anyone is at the mercy of this man!\" groaned Parker.\n\n\"Not absolutely, I'm sorry to say,\" said the doctor. \"The action of\nthought on the human consciousness is exactly like that of sound on\nthe tuning fork. When the mind is tuned right, we'll say for\nillustration, the lower vibrations are not picked out of the ether.\nBut as few minds are tuned right, and as all vary from time to time,\nI'm practically omnipotent.\"\n\n\"You have changed the nature of my wife!\" Parker was getting hold of\nhimself and he could speak with a degree of calmness. \"That is a worse\ncrime than the one you've committed against me directly!\"\n\n\"Mr. Parker,\" said the doctor, impressively, \"you are in a web. I am\nthe spider. You are the fly. I don't particularly desire to hurt you,\nbut I want your wife. This is the crux of the matter. She is the woman\nto share my triumphs. Already I have aroused her interest. Give her up\nand you will continue your work as before. Refuse, and you will lose\nher just as certainly as though you give her to me. For, my dear sir,\nyou will be insane in less than a month from now. I promise you\nthat!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAllen Parker was not one to indulge in melodrama. For a long moment he\nsat looking into the black eyes of Von Stein. Then he spoke carefully.\n\n\"If my wife of her own will loved you, and wanted freedom, I'd let her\ngo. But this is a kind of hypnosis. It's diabolical!\"\n\n\"Who but the devil was the father of magic?\" asked the doctor,\ncheerfully. \"Hypnosis is unconsciously based on a scientific principle\nwhich I have mastered. Repeated advertising of a tooth brush or a box\nof crackers is mild mental suggestion--hypnosis, if you will. My dear\nfellow, be sensible!\"\n\n\"Sophistry!\" growled Parker.\n\nVon Stein laughed. He moved a lever upon a dial and a sheet of blue\nflame quivered between them. With another movement of the lever it\nvanished.\n\n\"I could destroy you instantly,\" he said, \"and completely, and no one\ncould prove a crime! I shall not do it. I have no time to be bothered\nwith investigations. Think of the fate I have promised you. Think, and\nyou will give her up!\"\n\n\"I shall not!\" Parker wiped cold drops from his forehead. The doctor\nfrowned thoughtfully.\n\n\"I'll intensify her desire to come here to-night,\" he said. \"She\nherself will persuade you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nParker set his fingers into the arms of his chair as Von Stein rose\nand walked to the copper bowl. He stood directly under it, and put on\ngoggles with shields fitting close to his feet. At the pressure of his\nfoot a tablelike affair rose from the floor in front of him. This,\nlike the desk, was equipped with numerous dials, buttons and levers.\nVon Stein manipulated them. The great cap of copper descended until\nhis head was enveloped by the mist of platinum wires. A faint humming\ngrew in the room. A tiny bell tinkled.\n\n\"The connection is made,\" murmured Von Stein. He lifted a hand for\nsilence: then his fingers leaped among the gadgets on the table. After\nthat came a brief period, measured by seconds, of immobility. Then the\ntable sank from view, the copper bowl lifted, and Dr. von Stein went\nback to his chair.\n\n\"She will be here shortly,\" he said. \"If that does not change your\nmind....\"\n\nHe shrugged. Parker knew what that shrug meant. He searched his mind\nfor a plan and found none. Better die fighting than yield, or risk the\nvengeance of Friedrich von Stein. If he could get the doctor away from\nthe desk where he controlled the blue-white flame there might be a\nchance to do something. Von Stein was by far the larger man, but\nParker had been an athlete all his life. If....\n\n\"That mass of copper and platinum,\" he said, tentatively, \"will make\nyou master of the world!\"\n\n\"My brain, my intelligence, has made me master of the world!\"\ncorrected Von Stein, proudly. He was touched in the right spot now.\n\"You have not seen all!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sprang up and went to one of the tables. From his pocket he took a\npiece of paper and crumpled it into a ball while, with the other hand,\nhe made some electrical connections to a plate of metal set into the\nsurface of the table. Next he placed the wad of paper on the plate.\nThen, standing at arm's length from the apparatus, he pressed a\nbutton. Instantly the paper disappeared behind a screen of the colors\nof the spectrum, from red to violet. The banded colors were there for\na minute fraction of a second. Then there was nothing where the paper\nhad been on the plate. Von Stein smiled as he stepped away from the\ntable.\n\n\"The electron is formed by the crossing of two lines of force,\" he\nsaid, \"and the interaction of positive and negative polarity. The\nelectron is a stress in the ether, nothing more, but it is the stuff\nof which all matter is made. Thought is vibration in one dimension;\nmatter in two. You have just seen me untie the knot, dissociate the\nelectrons, or what you will. In plain language I have caused matter to\nvanish utterly. That paper is not burned up. It no longer exists in\nany form. The earth upon which we stand, Parker, can be dissolved like\nmist before the sun!\"\n\nAppalled as he was at this man who boasted and made good his terrible\nboasts Allen Parker had not forgotten the purpose that was in him. Now\nwas his chance, while Von Stein stood smiling triumphantly between\ntable and desk.\n\nParker shot from his chair with the speed of utter desperation. He\nfeinted, and drove a vicious uppercut to the jaw of Dr. Friedrich von\nStein. The doctor reeled but he did not go down. His fists swung.\nParker found him no boxer, and beat a tattoo upon his middle. Von\nStein began to slump.\n\nThen two thick muscled arms closed around the artist from behind and\nhe was lifted clear of the floor. He kicked, and tried to turn, but it\nwas useless. The doctor recovered himself. His eyes blazed fury.\n\n\"Put him in the chair, Heinrich!\" he roared. \"For this I will show you\nwhat I can do, Herr Parker!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that instant little Hans, who had been yelping on the edge of the\nbattle, dashed in. He leaped for the throat of Von Stein. The doctor\nkicked him brutally.\n\nThe shriek of agony from Hans loosened the arms of Heinrich. Parker\ngot his footing again. He saw the clumsy serving man spring forward\nand gather his dog up to his breast. Again Parker rushed for his\nenemy.\n\nIt was clear now that Von Stein was cut off from the controls he\nwanted, and without Heinrich he could not master Parker in a fight.\nFor an instant he stood baffled. Then he retreated the length of the\nroom, taking what blows he could not beat off. He staggered upon a\nplate of metal set into the floor, righted himself, and failed in an\nattempt to catch hold of Parker. Suddenly he bowed in the direction of\nthe distant doorway.\n\nAllen half turned. Betty was coming down the room, staring and\nbreathless.\n\n\"_Leben sie wohl!_\" cried Von Stein. \"Farewell, Madame! I should like\nto take you with me!\"\n\nA great flash of the colors of the spectrum sent Parker reeling back.\nDr. Friedrich von Stein had gone the way of the crumpled ball of\npaper.\n\nThere was a long moment of silence. Then Allen Parker found his wife\nin his arms, clinging to him.\n\n\"'Are not two prayers a perfect strength?'\" she murmured, sobbing\nagainst his heart.\n\n\nA HUNDRED MILES UNDERGROUND\n\nScientists bidding their families good-by in the morning to drop fifty\nor a hundred miles underground in high speed elevators, there to\nundertake researches not possible nearer to the earth's surface, may\nbe realities of the next decade or two if some wealthy individual or\ninstitution accepts the recommendation of Dr. Harlow Shapley,\ndistinguished astronomer of Harvard, in a talk recently before the\nAmerican Geographical Society.\n\nThe earth's interior, Dr. Shapley said, is the \"third dimension\" of\ngeography. Exploration of the planet's surface soon must cease from\nlack of places to explore. Even the upper air is coming to be\nreasonably well known scientifically, thanks to instruments sent up\nwith balloons and to the radio and other investigators who have been\nuncovering secrets of upper-air electricity. But the interior of the\nearth is still one of the great mysteries. It is a paradox of\nastronomy that much more is known about the center of the sun or a\nstar like Sirius than about the center of the earth.\n\nDeep shafts of bore holes into the earth have been suggested often as\nsources of heat for human use. It is doubtful, however, whether such\nheat supplies could be obtained. For one thing, the supposed internal\nheat of the earth is still nothing but a guess. It may be that the\nrelatively slight increases of heat found as one goes deeper in\nexisting mines are due to radioactivity in the rocks instead of to\noutward seepage from the internal fires. Another difficulty about\nutilizing earth heat is that heat moves so slowly through substances\nlike rock, as any housewife can prove by trying to fry an egg on a\nbrick placed over a gas flame. As soon as the rock heat immediately at\nthe bottom of a bore hole had been exhausted heat supply would stop\nuntil more could diffuse in from the sides.\n\nDr. Shapley's suggestion, in any event, is not to search for heat but\nfor facts. Even in existing, relatively shallow mines, he believes,\nscientific laboratories at different depths under the surface might\nyield valuable data not now obtainable. Most scientific men will\nagree. Revolutionary as the idea may seem to those familiar only with\nthe standardized laboratories of physics or chemistry, there are sound\nreasons why a half-dozen or so of the sciences should do precisely\nwhat Dr. Shapley suggests.\n\nAt least one underground laboratory has already been installed, for\nProf. E. B. Babcock of the University of California has such a\nworkroom in the Twin Peaks Tunnel, underneath the mountain that rises\nabove the city of San Francisco. Natural radioactivity in the rocks\nthereabouts is greater than normal and Prof. Babcock finds that this\napparently increases new species among fruit flies.\n\nTo dig out laboratory rooms a mile or so down in existing deep mines\nprobably would cost far less than many enterprises already financed by\nphilanthropists. Even to deepen these shafts for several miles would\nbe much less difficult than most people imagine.\n\nIncreasing heat, if it is found that heat does increase, would not be\ndifficult to overcome had the engineers sufficient money. Ventilation\nand transportation to and from the surface, while too costly for the\nbusiness enterprise of winning metals from very deep mines, probably\nwould present no serious difficulty were facts the chief object\ninstead of profit. The only question to be decided before intending\nbenefactors of science are urged to consider some such project is\nwhether or not the facts likely to be won promise enough value to\nmankind.\n\nAn excellent case can be made out for answering yes. Dr. Shapley\nmentioned four chief lines of investigation suitable for such\ndeep-mine laboratories: studies of gravity and of the variable length\nof the day, researches on the various kinds of earthquake waves,\nexperiments on ether drift and tests of the biological effects of\ncosmic rays and of the rays from radium.\n\nAstronomical theories indicate that the day ought to be growing\nslightly longer as the earth's rotation decreases a trifle from\ncentury to century because of friction from the tides. The actual\nlength of the days seems, however, sometimes to be decreasing a tiny\nfraction of a second from year to year, as theory says that it should;\nsometimes to be increasing in a way for which no present theory\nprovides. Observations underneath the earth, with a portion of the\nplanet's crust and gravity overhead, might yield important clues to\nthe cause of this mysterious wrong time kept by the terrestrial\nclock.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gray Plague\n\n_By L. A. Eshbach_\n\n[Sidenote: Maimed and captive, in the depths of an interplanetary\nmeteor-craft, lay the only possible savior of plague-ridden Earth.]\n\n[Illustration: _They were almost upon him when he leaped into\naction._]\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nFive months before the beginning of that period of madness, that time\nof chaos and death that became known as the Gray Plague, the first of\nthe strange meteors fell to Earth. It landed a few miles west of El\nPaso, Texas, on the morning of March 11th.\n\nIn a few hours a great throng of people gathered around the dully\nsmoldering mass of fire-pitted rock, the upper half of which protruded\nfrom the Earth where it had buried itself, like a huge, roughly\noutlined hemisphere. And then, when the crowd had assumed its\ngreatest proportions, the meteor, with a mighty, Earth-shaking roar,\nexploded.\n\nA vast flood of radiance, more brilliant than the light of the sun,\nlit up the sky for miles around. One moment, a throng of curious\npeople, a number of scientists, newspaper men--a crashing\nexplosion--and then a great, yawning pit sending forth a blinding\nradiance! Destruction and death where life had been.\n\nThe brilliant light streamed from the pit for about ten minutes; then\nlike a snuffed-out candle flame, it vanished.\n\nThe second of the strange meteors landed on the evening of March 13th,\nin the city of Peking, China. It demolished several buildings, and\nburied itself beneath the ruins. The Chinese, unaware of the tragedy\nat El Paso, gathered in the vicinity, and when the meteor exploded at\nabout ten o'clock that night, were instantly destroyed. As in Texas,\nthe great pit emitted a cloud of dazzling light for about ten minutes,\nthrowing a brilliant glow over the city and its surroundings; then\nwas extinguished.\n\nThe people of the world awoke to the fact that events worthy of more\nthan passing interest were occurring. The press of every nation begin\ngiving the strange meteors more and more publicity. Statements of\ndifferent pseudo-scientists were published in explanation of the\nmeteor's origin, statements that aroused world wide conjecture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nApproximately twenty-four hours after the falling of the second\nmissile, the third one fell, landing near Madrid, Spain. The\nSpaniards, having received news of the El Paso and Peking tragedies,\navoided the ugly mass of rock as though it were a dreaded pestilence.\nIn every way its action was similar to that of its two predecessors.\n\nThe interest of the world was doubled now. The unusual similarity of\nthe action of the meteors, and the regularity of their landings,\nseemed indicative of a definite, hostile purpose behind it all. A\nmenace from the unknown--a peril from the skies!\n\nScientists began giving serious consideration to the unusual\nphenomenon, pottering around in the pits, wearing airs of puzzlement.\nBut their investigations were of no avail, for nothing of any great\nsignificance came to light through their efforts.\n\nAt about that time, an announcement was made that created a furor.\nAstronomers in different parts of the United States reported that they\nhad observed a bright flare of light leaping up from the darkened\nportion of the planet Venus. The astronomers had no definite idea of\nanything of importance in back of what they had seen; but not so the\nmasses. The flare, they said, was caused by the release of another\nmeteor!\n\nFrom Venus! Missiles, hurled by Venerians, menacing the Earth! The\nsilver planet became the subject of universal discussion; innumerable\nfantastic articles about it appeared in magazine sections of Sunday\nnewspapers. And the astronomers of Earth turned their telescopes\ntoward Venus with an interest they had never felt before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour days of expectant waiting passed by after the third meteor had\nfallen, while interest continued mounting at an accelerating pace. And\nthen, at about two o'clock in the morning of the 18th, three great\nobservatories, two in North America and one in England, recorded the\nfalling of an extraordinarily large and unusually brilliant meteor\nthat glowed with an intense, bluish-white light as it entered the\nEarth's atmosphere. And, unlike most meteors, this one was not\nconsumed by its intense heat, but continued gleaming brilliantly until\nit vanished below the horizon. Simultaneous with the falling of the\nmeteor, the Earth was rocked by one of the worst quakes in history.\n\nSeismographs in all parts of the world recorded the tremors of the\nEarth, each indicating that the disturbance had occurred somewhere\nbeneath the Atlantic ocean. Evidently the fourth meteor had fallen\ninto the ocean, for the shaking of the Earth was obviously the result\nof the collision. That quakes had not followed the landing of the\nfirst three was due to the fact that they had been far smaller than\nthe fourth.\n\nAnd then, a short time after the earthquake, the worst storm in two\nhundred years broke over the Atlantic. Waves, mountain high, piled\nthemselves upon each other in a wild frenzy; a shrieking wind lashed\nthe waters into a liquid chaos. Great ocean-liners were tossed about\nlike tiny chips; an appalling number of smaller ships were lost in\nthat insane storm.\n\nNor was the destruction confined to the sea, for all along the\nAtlantic coast of North America and Europe, mighty walls of water\nrushed in, and wrecked entire towns and cities.\n\nFortunately the storm was of short duration; a few hours after it\nbegan, it subsided.\n\nFor a number of weeks public attention was centered upon the meteors\nand storm; but gradually, when nothing further occurred, the fickle\ninterest of the masses began to wane. A month after the storm, the\nstrange meteors were no longer mentioned by the press, and\nconsequently, had passed from the public mind. Only the astronomers\nremembered, keeping their telescopes trained on Venus night after\nnight.\n\nFour months passed by during which nothing of an unusual nature came\nto the attention of the world. But at the end of that time, it\nsuddenly dawned upon those nations whose shores touched the Atlantic\nocean, that something extraordinary was happening. It was taking place\nso insidiously, so quietly, that it had attracted no great attention.\n\nA series of inexplicable sea disasters had begun. Every ship that had\ntraveled over a certain, regular steamship route, had disappeared,\nleaving no trace. Mysteriously, without warning, they had vanished;\nwithout a single S O S being sent, seven freighters had been lost. The\ndisappearances had been called to the world's attention by the\nshipping companies, alarmed at the gradual loss of their boats.\n\nThen other mysterious vanishings came to the attention of the world.\nShips in all parts of the Atlantic were being lost. When this fact\nbecame known, trans-Atlantic commerce ceased almost over night. With\nthe exception of a few privately owned yachts and freighters, the\nAtlantic became deserted.\n\nAnd finally, a few days after the world became aware of the strange\ndisappearances on the Atlantic, the Gray Plague introduced itself to\nhumanity. Attempts were made to repress the facts: but the tragedy of\nthe freighter, _Charleston_, in all its ghastliness and horror, became\nknown in spite of all attempts at secrecy.\n\nOn the morning of August 3rd, the _Charleston_ was found, half buried\nin the sand of a beach on the coast of Florida, cast there, evidently,\nby a passing storm. The freighter had been one of the first boats to\ndisappear.\n\nWhen the ship's discoverers boarded her, their eyes were greeted by a\nsight whose ghastliness filled them with a numbing horror. Indeed, so\nterrifying was the spectacle on the _Charleston_, that the\ndiscoverers, four boys of adolescent age, left in fear-stricken haste.\nNor could they be induced to return to the ship's deck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, a group of men from a nearby town boarded the freighter to\ninvestigate the boys' amazing report. In the group was a newspaper\nreporter who chanced to be in the vicinity on a minor story. It was\nthrough the reporter's account that the facts became known as quickly\nas they did.\n\nWhen the men clambered up the side of the _Charleston_ to her deck,\nthey saw a spectacle the like of which had never before been seen on\nEarth. Although they had been prepared for the horror to some extent\nby the story of the boys, the sight on the _Charleston_ exceeded their\ndescription to such a degree that, for the moment, the men were\nrendered speechless.\n\nThe deck of the _Charleston_ was a shambles--a scene of sudden,\nchilling death. All about were strewn gray, lifeless bodies. Death had\novertaken the crew in the midst of their duties, suddenly, without\nwarning, it seemed. Bodies strewn about--yet nowhere was there sign of\ndecay! Bodies, lifeless for days, or weeks--yet intact!\n\nThe men were fearfully impressed by the strangely grotesque positions\nof the corpses. With a few exceptions, they lay on the deck in\nabnormal, twisted masses of gray covered flesh. Somehow, they seemed\nflattened, as though they had been soft, jellylike, and had flowed,\nhad settled, flat against the deck. Some were no more than three\ninches thick, and had spread out to such an extent that they looked\nlike fantastic caricatures of human bodies. That unnatural change in\ntheir structure, and the ghastly, dead-gray color of their skins gave\nthe corpses a horrifying, utterly repulsive appearance that made the\nflesh of the men crawl.\n\nThe bodies had a strangely soft aspect, as though they were still\njellylike. One of the men, bolder than the rest, touched a body--and\nwithdrew his hand in revulsion and surprise. For the ugly mass was\ncold, and as hard as bone: the tissues of the flesh seemingly replaced\nby a solid, bony substance. Later investigation revealed that all the\ndead on the _Charleston_ had assumed a similar, bonelike solidity.\n\nWhen the men left the freighter to report the tragedy to the proper\nauthorities, their faces were blanched, and their nerves badly shaken.\nYet their horror was nothing when compared with what it would have\nbeen, had they known what was to follow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRapidly the story of the_ Charleston_ spread. By means of the press,\nover the radio, even by word of mouth, the story of the horror on the\nfreighter was given publicity. All over the United States and Canada\nit spread, and from thence to the rest of the world. Eagerly was the\nstory accepted: here, at last, was the explanation of the sea\ndisasters! And then, more than ever before, was the Atlantic ocean\nshunned.\n\nThe bodies of the seamen on the freighter were turned over to\nscientists for experimentation and research. It was thought that they\nmight be able to discover the cause of the Gray Death, and with a\nknowledge of its cause, create something with which to free the\nAtlantic from its scourge.\n\nThe scientists' investigations only served to mystify the world to a\ngreater degree. The only thing that came to light was the cause of the\nbodies' bonelike rigidity. In some inexplicable way the bones in the\nseamen had dissolved, and according to appearances, while the bodies\nwere plastic, had flattened out. And then, strange and unnatural\nthough it seemed, the calcium from the dissolved bones had gathered at\nthe surface of each body, and combining with the flesh and skin, had\nformed the hard, bony shell that gave them their ghastly grayness, and\ntheir appearance of petrification. Aside from this, the scientists\nlearned nothing; the cause of this amazing phenomenon was a complete\nmystery to them.\n\nSlowly, methodically, step by step, the unusual had been taking place.\nFrom the time of the landing of the first strange meteor, up to the\ndiscovery of the _Charleston_, there had been a gradual increase in\nthe significance of each succeeding event.\n\nThen finally came the climax: the Gray Plague itself. All that\npreceded it faded into significance before the horror of the dread\npestilence that seized the world with its destroying talons.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA short time after the discovery of the _Charleston_, the Plague made\nits first appearance on land. Slowly, pitilessly, inexorably, it\nbegan, taking its toll all along the Atlantic coast. From Newfoundland\nto Brazil; from the British Isles to Egypt, wherever people lived near\nthe ocean, thousands were stricken with the dread malady.\n\nThe old and infirm were the most quickly affected; their weakened\nbodies could not withstand the ravage of the Plague as could those of\nyounger people. An old man, walking along a large thoroughfare in\nSavannah, Georgia, suddenly uttered a fearful shriek and sank to the\npavement. While the pedestrians watched with bulging eyes, he seemed\nto shrink, to flatten, to flow liquidly, turning a ghastly gray.\nWithin an hour he was as hard as the men of the _Charleston_. Of all\nthe millions, perhaps he was the first.\n\nOthers followed in the wake of the first victim, young as well as old;\nthree hours after the death in Savannah, every channel of\ncommunication was choked with news of a constantly increasing number\nof casualties. A Boston minister, preaching a funeral sermon,\ncollapsing beside the coffin; a lineman on a telegraph pole, overcome,\nfalling--and splashing! A thousand incongruous tragedies shocking\nhumanity.\n\nIn Europe the action of the Plague was the same as in North America.\nDeath stalking the sea-coast, destroying thousands; ignorant\nfishermen, men of learning, women and children of every age--all were\ngrist to be ground in the mill of the Gray Plague.\n\nBefore a week had gone by, no one remained alive in the villages,\ntowns and cities all along the Atlantic. New York, London, all the\nlarge coast cities were deserted by the living, left to the rigid\ndead. From the largest metropolis to the smallest hamlet, all became\nbody-glutted tombs.\n\nAnd then, on the morning of October 12th, news was given to the world\nthat threw mankind into a panic. The Plague was moving inland! Slowly,\nyet relentlessly it spread, no longer confining its effect to the\nsea-coast, but moving farther and farther inland toward the heart of\nthe two continents, driving mankind before it. For people fled in\ninsane terror before the advancing death. Nor was there escape from\nthe menace--no antidote to counteract, no sanctuary wherein to hide.\n\nTo North and South, to East and West, the pestilence spread,\ndestroying as it went. Unless there were some miraculous intervention,\nthe human race would be destroyed!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOfficials of the world were at their wits' end; scientists threw up their\nhands in despair. The Plague was an insoluble puzzle--enigmatical, utterly\ninexplicable, beyond the knowledge of Earth.\n\nScientists and doctors were brutally slain during that period by\nfear-crazed mobs, because of their inability to rescue the world from\nthe grip of the Plague. Thousands of people died while striving to\nescape from the Gray Death, crushed by passing motor vehicles, or\nstarving in the congested areas. Gone was the boasted civilization of\nman--humanity sinking rapidly to the level of the beast; gone,\ndestroyed in a few weeks!\n\nAnd then one day when the end seemed perilously close, there was\nushered into the presence of the remnant of the United States\nofficials who had gathered in San Francisco, a twisted monstrosity of\na man, fearfully scarred and deformed. He was closeted with them for\ntwo hours. At the end of that time an excited official communicated\nwith the leader of the American scientists.\n\n\"A cure for the Plague has been discovered!\" he cried in joyful tones.\n\"Man still has a chance!\"\n\nBefore an hour had passed by, scientists were in possession of\ncultures of germs that would destroy the bacilli of the Gray Death.\nThe hope of salvation restored some semblance of order; and in a very\nshort time the development of the germs was going forward as rapidly\nas skilled bacteriologists could carry it. Forces of doctors were\nmarshalled to administer the cure, inoculating all who were untouched\nby the Plague.\n\nAt about that time, a small, bronze-colored sphere arose into the air\nabove San Francisco, and sped eastward with amazing velocity. It\nflashed over the United States, over the Atlantic ocean, and over\nwestern Europe, finally landing in the midst of the European hordes.\nThere its operator, a deformed cripple, left bacteria similar to those\nhe had given to the United States.\n\nIn a short time Europe, too, was busily engaged in developing the\nbacteria, and inoculating her people.\n\nMany others died before the world was rendered immune, but at last\nmankind let its labors cease. The Gray Plague was overcome.\n\nThen the work of reclaiming the deserted areas was begun; then, too,\nwas started the ghastly task of disposing of the countless, rigid\ndead. And finally, a great steamer left New York harbor, and started\nacross the Atlantic. It was the purpose of the men on board to destroy\nutterly the source of the Plague.\n\nBut long before that occurred, humanity had heard the story of Phillip\nParkinson, the man who saved the world--had heard, and had honored the\ndeliverer of mankind.\n\nParkinson's story follows:\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe steam yacht, Diana, bound for the Azores and points south, was two\ndays out from Miami when the great meteor fell into the Atlantic. On\nthe after deck, leaning over the rail, watching the moonlit waters,\nstood Phillip Parkinson, owner of the yacht. A bacteriologist of\ninternational fame was Parkinson, on an early vacation to recuperate\nfrom the effects of a strenuous winter of research. Nervous, rather\nhigh-strung, he had been unable to sleep; at about one in the morning\nof the 18th of March, he had come up on deck.\n\nHe had stood there for about an hour when suddenly there appeared in\nthe sky above him, a meteor, a great disc of blue-white incandescence.\nIt seemed to be rushing straight down toward him; instinctively he\nleaped back, as though to avoid the fiery missile.\n\nAs the constantly expanding disc flashed through the hundred miles of\nEarth's atmosphere, the ocean, as far as eye could see, became as\nlight as day. Bathed in that baleful, white glare, Parkinson,\nbewildered, dazed, half-blinded, watched the approaching stellar\nvisitant.\n\nIn a few moments it struck--no more than two miles away. In the last,\nbright flare of blue-white light, Parkinson saw a gigantic column of\nsteam and boiling water leap up from the sea. Then thick, impenetrable\ndarkness fell--darkness that was intensified by its contrast with the\nmeteor's blinding light.\n\nFor ten tense, breathless seconds utter silence hung over the sea ...\nthen, for those on the yacht, the world went mad! A shrill, unearthly\nshriek--the sound of the meteor's passage through the atmosphere; an\near-splitting roar, as of the simultaneous release of the\nthunder-drums of ages; a howling demon of wind; a solid wall of\nraging, swirling water of immeasurable height--all united in an\nindescribable chaos that bewildered those on board the Diana, and that\nlifted the yacht and--threw it upon its side!\n\nWhen the first rushing mountain of lathering, thundering water crashed\nupon the yacht, Parkinson felt himself hurtling through the roaring\nair. For a moment he heard the infernal pandemonium of noise ... then\nthe strangling, irresistible brine closed over his head.\n\nA blackness deeper than that of the night--and Parkinson knew no\nmore....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly consciousness returned to the bacteriologist. It came under the\nguise of a dull, yet penetrating throbbing coming from beneath the\nsurface on which he lay. Vaguely he wondered at it; he had not yet\nentirely cast off the enshrouding stupor that gripped him.\n\nGradually he came into full possession of his faculties--and became\naware of a dull aching throughout his entire body. In his chest it\nseemed to be intensified; every breath caused a sharp pang of pain.\n\nFaltering and uncertain, he arose and peered around. Before, lay the\nopen sea, calm now, and peaceful. Long, rolling swell swept in and\ndashed themselves against the rocks a few feet away. Rocks? For a\nmoment Parkinson stared at the irregular shore-line in dazed wonder.\nThen as his mind cleared, the strangeness of his position flashed upon\nhim.\n\nSolid earth was under his feet! Although he must be hundreds of miles\nfrom shore, in some way he had drifted upon land. So far as he knew,\nthere were no islands in that part of the Atlantic; yet his very\nposition belied the truth. He could not have drifted to the mainland;\nthe fact that he was alive precluded all possibilities of that, for he\nwould have drowned in far less time than the latter thought implied.\n\nHe turned and inspected the land upon which he had been cast. A small,\nbarren island, bleak and inhospitable, and strangely metallic, met his\ngaze. The rays of the sun beating down upon it were thrown back with\nan uncomfortable intensity; the substance of the island was a\nlustrous, copperlike metal. No soil softened the harshness of the\nsurface; indescribably rugged and pitted was the two hundred-foot\nexpanse. It reminded Parkinson of a bronze relief-map of the moon.\n\nFor a moment he puzzled over the strangeness of the unnatural island;\nthen suddenly he realized the truth. This was the meteor! Obviously,\nthis was the upper side of the great sphere from space, protruding\nabove the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFortunate for him that the meteor had not been completely covered by\nwater, he thought--but was it fortunate? True, he was alive now,\nthanks to the tiny island, but how long would he remain alive without\nfood or water, and without hope of securing either? Unless he would be\npicked up by a passing steamer, he would die a far more unpleasant\ndeath than that of drowning. Some miracle had saved him from a watery\ngrave; it would require another to rescue him from a worse fate.\n\nEven now he was beginning to feel thirsty. He had no way of\ndetermining how long he had been unconscious, but that it was at least\nten hours, he was certain, for the sun had been at its zenith when he\nhad awakened. No less than fifteen hours had gone by since\nwater--other than that of the sea--had passed his lips. And the fact\nthat it was impossible for him to quench his thirst only served to\nrender it more acute.\n\nIn order to take his mind from thoughts of his thirst and of the\nimmediate future, he rapidly circled the island. As he had expected,\nit was utterly barren. With shoulders drooping in despair he settled\nwearily to a seat on the jagged mass of metal high up on top of the\nmeteor.\n\nAn expression of sudden interest lit up his face. For a second time he\nfelt that particular throbbing, that strange pulsing beneath the\nsurface of the meteor. But now it was far more noticeable than before.\nIt seemed to be directly below him, and very close to the surface.\n\nParkinson could not tell how long he sat there, but from the\nappearance of the sun, he thought that at the very shortest, an hour\npassed by while he remained on that spot. And during that time, the\nthrobbing gradually increased until the metal began vibrating under\nhis feet.\n\nSuddenly the bacteriologist leaped aside. The vibrating had reached\nits height, and the meteor seemed to lurch, to tilt at a sharp angle.\nHis leap carried him to firm footing again. And then, his thirst and\nhopeless position completely forgotten, Parkinson stared in\nfascination at the amazing spectacle before him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn eighteen-foot disc of metal, a perfect circle, seemed to have been\ncut out of the top of the meteor. While he watched, it began turning\nslowly, ponderously, and started sinking into the meteor. As it sank,\nParkinson fancied that it grew transparent, and gradually vanished\ninto nothingness--but he wasn't sure.\n\nA great pit, eighteen feet wide, but far deeper, lay before him in the\nvery place where, not more than ten minutes before, he had stood. Not\na moment too soon had he leaped.\n\nMotionless he stood there, waiting in tense expectation. What would\nhappen next, he had not the least idea, but he couldn't prevent his\nimagination from running riot.\n\nHe hadn't long to wait before his watching was rewarded. A few minutes\nafter the pit appeared, he heard a loud, high-pitched whir coming from\nthe heart of the meteor. As it grew louder, it assumed a higher and\nstill higher key, finally rising above the range of human ears. And at\nthat moment the strange vehicle arose to the surface.\n\nA simple-appearing mechanism was the car, consisting of a twelve-foot\nsphere of the same bronze-like metal that made up the meteor, with a\nhuge wheel, like a bronze cincture, around its middle. It was the\nwhirling of this great wheel that had caused the high-pitched\nwhirring. The entire, strange machine was surrounded by a peculiar\ngreen radiance, a radiance that seemed to crackle ominously as the\nsphere hovered over the mouth of the pit.\n\nFor a moment the car hung motionless, then it drifted slowly to the\nsurface of the meteor, landing a few feet away from Parkinson. Hastily\nhe drew back from the greenly phosphorescent thing--but not before he\nhad experienced an unpleasant prickling sensation over his entire\nbody.\n\nAs the bacteriologist drew away, there was a sharp, audible click\nwithin the interior of the sphere; and the green radiance vanished. At\nthe same moment, three heavy metal supports sprang from equi-distant\npoints in the sides of the car, and held the sphere in a balanced\nposition on the rounded top of the meteor.\n\nThere was a soft, grating sound on the opposite side of the car.\nQuickly, Parkinson circled it--and stopped short in surprise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMen were descending from an opening in the side of the sphere!\nParkinson had reasoned that since the meteor had come from the depths\nof space, any being in its interior, unnatural as that seemed, would\nhave assumed a form quite different from the human. Of course,\nconditions on Earth could be approximated on another planet. At any\nrate, whatever the explanation, the sphere was emitting men!\n\nThey were men--but there was something queer about them. They were\nvery tall--seven feet or more--and very thin; and their skins were a\ndelicate, transparent white. They looked rather ghostly in their\ntight-fitting white suits. It was not this that made them seem queer,\nhowever: it was an indefinite something, a vague suggestion of\nheartless inhumanity, of unearthliness, that was somehow repulsive and\nloathsome.\n\nThere were three of them, all very similar in appearance and bearing.\nTheir surprise at the sight of Parkinson, if anything, was greater\nthan the start their appearance had given him. He, at least, had\nexpected to see beings of some sort, while the three had been taken\ncompletely by surprise.\n\nFor a moment they surveyed him with staring, cold-blue eyes. Then\nParkinson extended his hand, and as cordially as he could, exclaimed:\n\n\"Hello! Welcome to Earth!\"\n\nThe visitors from space ignored his advances and continued staring at\nhim. Their attitude at first was quizzical, speculative, but slowly a\nhostile expression crept into their eyes.\n\nSuddenly, with what seemed like common consent, they faced each other,\nand conversed in low tones in some unintelligible tongue. For almost a\nminute they talked, while Parkinson watched them in growing\napprehension.\n\nFinally they seemed to have reached some definite conclusion; with one\naccord they turned and moved slowly toward the bacteriologist,\nsomething distinctly menacing in their attitudes. The men from the\nmeteor were tall, but they were thin; Parkinson, too, was large, and\nhis six-foot length was covered with layers of solid muscle. As the\nthree advanced toward him, he doubled his fists, and crouched in\nreadiness for the expected attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were almost upon him when he leaped into action. A crushing left\nto his stomach sent the first one to the meteor-top, where he lay\ndoubled up in pain. But that was the only blow that Parkinson struck;\nin a moment he found himself lying prone upon his back, utterly\nhelpless, his body completely paralyzed. What they had done to him, he\ndid not know; all that he could remember was two thin bodies twining\nthemselves around him--a sharp twinge of pain at the base of his\nskull; then absolute helplessness.\n\nOne of the tall beings grasped Parkinson about the waist, and with\nsurprising strength, threw him over his shoulder. The other assisted\nhis groaning fellow. When the latter had recovered to some extent, the\nthree ascended the ladder that led into the metal sphere.\n\nThe interior of the strange vehicle, as far as Parkinson could see,\nwas as simple as its exterior. There was no intricate machinery of any\nsort in the square room; probably what machinery there was lay between\nthe interior and exterior walls of the sphere. As for controls, these\nconsisted of several hundred little buttons that studded one of the\nwalls.\n\nWhen they entered the vehicle, Parkinson was literally, and none too\ngently, dumped upon the floor. The man who had carried him stepped\nover to the controls. Like those of a skilled typist, his long, thin\nfingers darted over the buttons. In a moment the sphere was in motion.\n\nThere were no more thrills for Parkinson in that ride than he would\nhave derived from a similar ride in an elevator. They sank very slowly\nfor some minutes, it seemed to him; then they stopped with a barely\nnoticeable jar.\n\nThe door of the car was thrust aside by one of the three, and\nParkinson was borne from the sphere. A bright, coppery light flooded\nthe interior of the meteor, seeming to radiate from its walls. In his\nhelpless state, and in the awkward position in which he was carried,\nwith his head close to the floor, he could see little of the room\nthrough which they passed, in spite of the light. Later, however, he\nlearned that it was circular in shape, and about twice the diameter of\nthe cylindrical tube that led into it. The wall that bound this\nchamber was broken at regular intervals by tall, narrow, doorways,\neach leading into a different room.\n\nParkinson was carried into one of these, and was placed in a\nhigh-backed metal chair. After he had been strapped fast, one of the\nmen placed his hands at the base of the bacteriologist's skull; he\nfelt a sudden twinge of pain; and his strange paralysis left him\nsuddenly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe knew it was useless to struggle; without resisting, he let them\nplace upon his head a cap-like device that seemed lost in a tangled\nmaze of machinery. Each meteor-man grasped one of the instruments\nresembling old-time radio head-phones that were fastened to\nParkinson's head-gear, and clamped it over his ears.\n\nThe bacteriologist heard a steady, humming drone, like a swarm of\nangry bees--felt a peculiar, soothing warmth about his head; and then\nhe slept.\n\nOnly a moment or two seemed to have passed when he awoke. The strange\ndevice on his head was removed and put away; and then, to Parkinson's\namazement, one of the three men, evidently the leader, spoke--in\nEnglish!\n\n\"Now that you have recovered consciousness,\" he remarked in a cold,\nexpressionless voice, \"you had better realize at the very beginning\nthat you are completely in our power. Any effort to escape will be\nfutile, for there is only one way to reach the outside; the opening\nthrough the top; and only one means of travel through that opening:\nthe sphere. And since you know nothing about the operation of the\nmachine, any attempt to run it would be disastrous to you.\n\n\"If you promise to refrain from violence, we'll release you, and give\nyou some measure of freedom. We'll do this because you can be of\nassistance to us in one of our tasks here on your planet.\"\n\nParkinson assented readily; he knew he could gain nothing by rejecting\ntheir offer. \"Of course I'll promise. But--but, how did you learn\nEnglish?\" he asked in bewilderment.\n\n\"You taught us,\" the leader replied. \"That device we placed upon your\nhead created a duplicate of your knowledge in our minds. We knew your\nlanguage, your world, indeed, yourself, as well as you do.\"\n\nParkinson shook his head in amazement. Another question came to his\nmind as the men released him. He was interrupted before he could give\nit expression.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Don't ask,\" the leader exclaimed. \"I'll tell our entire story so that\nyou'll have no occasion to annoy us with your questions.\n\n\"We're Venerians,\" he began, \"inhabitants of the planet you call\nVenus. For ages our world has been overcrowded. A short time ago, the\nconditions became so acute that something had to be done. It was\nsuggested that we seek another habitable planet to which our people\ncould migrate.\n\n\"Your Earth was thought to be the world with physical conditions most\nclosely resembling those of Acor, or Venus. Our scientists set to work\nimmediately, using forces and devices with which you are totally\nunfamiliar, and constructed several missiles which they hurled at\nEarth. These missiles, spherical masses closely resembling meteors,\nwere set to explode after a certain period of contact with an\natmosphere similar to our own. By their explosion we on Venus could\ndetermine whether or not this world had a breathable atmosphere.\n\n\"Upon our deciding that the Earth was habitable, we built this great\nmachine. It is chiefly composed of our greatest heat-resister, a\nmetal we call thoque; I see no corresponding word in your vocabulary;\nevidently you are unfamiliar with the element, or else it is unknown\non Earth.\n\n\"After our flight through space, automatically controlled, by the way,\non Venus, we landed here. With our thoque disintegrator, we bored a\npassageway to the surface of this great sphere. Then we entered the\ncar, rose to the top of the passageway, and discovered you.\n\n\"That is a brief synopsis of our actions--and it must suffice! Ask no\nquestions; we do not wish to be disturbed by the blind gropings of\nyour primitive mind!\"\n\nThere was a cold finality in the Venerian's voice that convinced\nParkinson that for the moment, at least, he had better forget the many\nquestions that had surged up in his mind.\n\nThe Venerian leader spoke again. \"From our observations of your mind,\nwe know that you have not had food or water for a rather lengthy\nperiod of time. It is not our purpose to starve you: you shall eat and\ndrink.\"\n\nA minute later Parkinson sat at a very high table in one of the rooms,\ndrinking water from Venus, and eating the fare of an alien world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDays passed by, merging into weeks, while Parkinson lost all track of\ntime. The bacteriologist's existence became a ceaseless round of toil.\nThe Venerian had said that he would be given some measure of freedom,\nbecause he would be of use to them; he had not been with them long ere\nhe learned what that use was.\n\nOne of the rooms was filled with great slabs of thoque; it was\nParkinson's task to carry the slabs to the vehicle at the base of the\nshaft, one by one; to rise to the surface with them, accompanied by\ntwo of the men--the third was working on the surface--and there unload\nthem. Day after day this continued.\n\nHope of escaping was almost dead in Parkinson's breast, because he\nwas constantly under the surveillance of those hard, blue eyes. Only\none thing kept hope alive: by watching the Venerians operate the car,\nhe was slowly gaining a knowledge of the meaning of the many buttons\nin the wall. Some day, if an opportunity came, he meant to be ready to\ntake advantage of it.\n\nOnce, shortly after his monotonous toil began, Parkinson experienced a\ngreat flare of hope for deliverance. They had just brought another\nslab to the surface, when a steamer appeared above the horizon. It was\nfar away, but its crew must surely have seen the island.\n\nBut his expectations were short-lived. One of the three drew from\nbeneath his tight-fitting, white garments a little, metal object, a\nlong tube, with a handle at one end, and pointed it at the vessel. For\na moment he held it thus, moving it slowly backward and forward: then\nhe returned it to its place of concealment, and turned away with an\nair of indifference. And Parkinson saw the ship burst suddenly into\nflame, a few minutes later to sink beneath the waves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShaken to the depths of his being, Parkinson resumed his work. The\ninhumanity of these saturnine Venerians filled him with a dread so\ngreat that he refused to admit it to himself. That that had not been\nthe first time that they had destroyed a ship, he felt sure; his heart\nsank, and grew more hopeless.\n\nAt last his task of carrying slabs was finished. The room was empty,\nand the work completed. A great tower, entirely covering the island,\nreared its head into the sky. In appearance, it resembled a very tall\nlighthouse. This resemblance held true only until its top was reached;\nthere it ended. From the tower's top extended four long, hollow arms,\nso constructed that they whirled about the tower at a mad pace when\nthe machinery with which they were connected was started. In addition,\narrangement was made for a powerful blast of air to be sent through\nthe tubes when the Venerians so desired.\n\nWhat the purpose of this great edifice was, Parkinson could not guess:\nlater, he learned the horrible significance of it all.\n\nAfter the tower was finished, the bacteriologist was left to his own\ndevices to a great extent, though always closely watched by one of his\ncaptors. They let him eat all the food he desired, and let him lie\naround as much as he wished, regaining his health and strength. This\nwas a pleasant surprise for him: he took full advantage of his\nprivileges.\n\nThen, one day when Parkinson had fully recovered from the effects of\nhis grueling labors, the leader of the Venerians approached him from\nbehind, and before he could raise a hand in defense, had rendered him\nhelplessly paralyzed.\n\n\"You will now be given a second opportunity to help the cause of Venus\non Earth,\" he said in his expressionless voice. And so saying, he\nlifted Parkinson, and bore him into one of the rooms.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAt no time while he was held captive by the Venerians was Parkinson as\nhopeless, or as completely filled with despair as when he was carried\ninto this room. There was something depressing about the chamber,\nsomething that gripped his heart with the chill hand of dread. He had\na feeling of impending evil.\n\nThe few momentary glimpses of the chamber that he had gotten while he\nwas being carried, sufficed to convince Parkinson that this was a\nlaboratory, or--he shuddered at the thought--an operating room. The\nwalls, floor and ceiling were composed of a white porcelainlike\nsubstance: from these walls, strangely, streamed the same coppery\nlight that filled the entire meteor.\n\nEntirely concealing one wall was a long, glass case, constructed to\nform countless little niches, each of which held a small, transparent\nvessel. At the back of the room was a high table, covered with\ntransparent cases which were filled with complex instruments of every\ndescription, some similar to those on Earth; others entirely\ndifferent.\n\nThe thing that brought the thought of an operating room to Parkinson's\nmind was the long, white slab that rested on metal uprights in the\nroom's center--an operating table. A moment after they entered the\nroom, he had his theory substantiated: the Venerian leader placed him\non the white slab, stretching him to full length. It was an operating\ntable--and he was to be the subject of their operation!\n\nHe had lain there but a moment when two of the Venerians approached,\none on either side, and began removing his clothing. It was not long\nbefore he lay on the cold slab, entirely nude.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile he was being stripped, he heard the leader of the Venerians\nmoving about, heard the click of glass, the rasp of metal upon metal.\nBut, unable to move his eyes, he had seen none of his activities,\nexcept to note that several of the little vessels had been taken from\ntheir resting places.\n\nWhen the two had finished disrobing him, and had replaced him upon his\nback, the leader appeared. He looked down at Parkinson, a queer\nexpression in his hard, blue eyes. He seemed to hesitate a moment:\nthen he spoke.\n\n\"Earthling,\" he said in his toneless voice, \"I have decided to tell\nyou of our intentions. You are going to play a very important part in\nour scheme, and it is only fitting that you should know. You can do\nnothing to hinder our plans: you are giving us incalculable aid: and\nit affords me some degree of satisfaction to tell you this.\n\n\"As you know, Earthling, we purpose to have the people of Acor to come\nto Earth to live, to relieve the congested conditions of our own\nworld. Obviously, there is no room for two types of intelligent\nbeings on one planet--your race must go! It is our intention to\ndestroy all human life on Earth!\n\n\"We intend accomplishing this with Venerian microbes. From the record\nof your knowledge, I've learned that diseases of various kinds are\ncommon on Earth. We expected that such would be the case, and thus,\nyou would not be immune to germs, so we came prepared. Each of the\nsmall compartments in that case that you may have seen, contains a\nculture of a different germ. After we have determined which Venerian\nbacilli will be the most effective, we will develop them in great\nquantities, and loose them upon your world.\n\n\"In the selecting process, you will play your part. Since our germs\nmay have a different effect upon your bodies than they do upon\nVenerians, we will inoculate you with different diseases, and watch\ntheir effects upon you.\n\n\"Of course, you yourself will be in no great danger, for we will have\nthe diseases under our constant control. On Acor we have abolished\ndisease entirely, having a reagent or an antitoxin for every malady;\nwe will use our cures upon you immediately after we have seen how you\nreact to each disease.\n\n\"What we desire is a bacillus that will take effect when it is\nbreathed in through the lungs. If the disease is of such a nature as\nto instill fear in the minds of observers, so much the better; but\nthat is unnecessary. When we discover a microbe of that nature, we\nwill be ready to act.\n\n\"By the way, our work has been lessened to a great degree by the fact\nthat you are a bacteriologist. The knowledge we gain from you has\nenabled us to eliminate at least half of our microbes. All Venerian\ngerms that are duplicated on Earth will be left out of our\ncalculations. Only those unknown to your planet will be tried upon\nyou.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the Venerian had finished his explanation, each word of which had\nsounded like a death knell to Parkinson, the bacteriologist lay on\nthe slab in the grip of a nightmare of horror. The cold-blooded\nbrutality of these Venerian beasts, and the thought of lying there\nhelpless with his body the prey of unknown diseases, filled him with a\nmaddening fear and dread.\n\nMightily he struggled to break the uncanny bonds that held him\nparalyzed, but it was of no avail. His body retained its helpless\nrigidity.\n\nOnly for a moment was Parkinson left to his fearful musings; then the\nVenerians begin their work. A tall table on wheels was brought from\nsomewhere, and drawn to the side of the slab. Upon this various\ninstruments were placed, side by side with numerous flat vessels\ncontaining germ cultures. Parkinson saw none of this, but from the\nsounds that came to his ears he could infer what was taking place.\n\nFinally, everything seemed to be in readiness. The Venerian leader\nbent over Parkinson for a moment: and the latter felt a sharp pain in\nhis side. Then the Venerian withdrew.\n\nSlowly, interminably, the time dragged by while the microbes that had\nbeen introduced into his body were at their work. How long he lay\nthere with the Venerians watching, he could not tell, but it seemed to\nbe hours. During that time he felt himself gripped by an increasingly\nviolent fever. Unbearable heat flooded his body. And because of his\nhelplessness, he could do nothing to relieve his pain and discomfort.\nIt was maddening!\n\nWhen he thought he had reached the limit of his endurance, and felt\nthat he would go insane in another moment, the Venerian leader\ninjected something into his side. He became aware of an immediate\nsense of relief; in an unbelievably short time the fever had left him\nand he was himself again.\n\nThere followed for Parkinson hours of nightmare agony, while the\nVenerians experimented with his living body. Time after time he was\ninoculated with strange bacilli that wracked him with tortures\nindescribable. Hideous diseases covered him with festering sores;\ntwisted his flesh into a repellent mass of scars; left him weakened\nand deformed. Had it not been for the incredible curative powers of\nthe Venerians, he would have died then; but always, when the end\nseemed at hand, they brought him back to life, only to subject him to\nother horrors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter what seemed countless ages, the Venerians left him alone. Under\nthe powerful effects of their cures, Parkinson began to recover. Hope\nwelled up in his heart; perhaps the terrible experiments were ended.\n\nWhen he was almost certain that the torture was over, his hopes were\nsuddenly destroyed. The three Venerians approached again, each bearing\na number of vessels containing germ cultures. These they placed on the\ntable at Parkinson's side; then two of them withdrew, leaving the\nleader to continue his work. Uttering a few words in the Venerian\ntongue, he occupied himself with something on the table, and a moment\nlater turned toward the bacteriologist, a long needle in his hands.\n\nParkinson felt a great burning pain in his left arm, as though a\nsearing, hot needle had been thrust into his flesh. In a moment this\nvanished. Then a feeling of irresistible lassitude overwhelmed him; an\nunbearable weariness filled him with longing for rest, peace--death.\nThis, too, was of short duration.\n\nWith the passing of the weariness, Parkinson became aware of a sharp\nthrobbing in his arm. Rapidly this increased in violence, until\nsuddenly an unbearable, excruciating agony seized him. Far greater was\nthis than any pain he had suffered before. For a moment he struggled\nto scream, to move, to do anything to relieve his agony. There seemed\nto be a sudden snap--a cry of anguish burst from his lips--and his\nsenses left him. Just as the bonds of paralysis had broken, he had\nlost consciousness.\n\nLife returned to Parkinson very slowly. In a daze he stared around,\nuncomprehending. Then suddenly he realized that he was no longer\nparalyzed: nor was he in the operating room. The bed on which he lay\nwas soft, comfortable; the room, unfamiliar. But not for long did his\nmind dwell upon this; in a few moments his eyelids closed, and he\nslept the sleep of complete mental and physical exhaustion.\n\nDaring the weeks that followed, Parkinson did little other than sleep.\nOccasionally he arose, either to stretch himself, or to secure food,\nbut for the greater part of the time he remained in bed. His body was\na mere shadow of its former self as the result of his terrible\nexperience on the white slab: his incessant sleeping, necessary\nbecause of his weakened condition, served to bring him back to his\nformer health. The Venerians seemed glad to have it thus: asleep, he\ndid not disturb their activities.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he had awakened from his first period of natural slumber, he had\nreceived a terrible shock. His left arm was gone, amputated at the\nshoulder. Strangely, the wound had healed while he slept, probably the\nresult of the Venerian doctoring, so there was no pain: but the shock\nhad been terrible.\n\nAfter he had recovered from the effects of that shock, he had resolved\nto make the Venerians pay for what they had done. And then he had\nrealized that the inhuman brutes must be destroyed for a greater\nreason: unless he interfered, he believed that they would carry out\ntheir intention of destroying all human life.\n\nAs the weeks passed by, while strength was returning to Parkinson, he\nlearned in a general way what the invaders were doing. They were\nengaged in developing vast quantities of microbes to be spread over\nEarth. When these were ready, a great amount of fine dust that the\nVenerians had brought with them, was impregnated with the bacilli.\nThis was then taken up into the tower, where, as Parkinson learned\nlater, it was blown out through the four tubes that spun around the\ntower's top, to drift through the air--to enter human bodies--to\ndestroy life.\n\nThe Venerians worked with the cultures and impregnated dust without\nprotection of any sort: evidently they were immune to the disease.\nLater Parkinson learned that he was likewise immune; they had rendered\nhim so after trying the germs upon him.\n\nGradually the bacteriologist's health returned--so gradually that his\ncaptors seemed not to notice it. He was glad of this, for their\nvigilance had relaxed, and he did not want it renewed. Even when he\nwas as strong and well as ever, he spent much time in bed, shamming\nillness. And when he could do so without danger of detection, he kept\na close watch upon the three, waiting for a time when he would be\nentirely alone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last his opportunity came. The three Venerians rose to the surface\ntogether, leaving him in his room, to all outward appearances, asleep.\nBut sleep was far from him at that moment; he had been watching.\n\nShortly after the sphere had vanished up the shaft, Parkinson emerged\nfrom his room. For a moment he surveyed the circle of doors: then he\nshrugged his shoulders. They all looked alike to him. Quickly he\ncrossed the room, and pressed a button that mechanically opened a\ndoor. It was his purpose, first of all, to secure a weapon; one room\nwould do as well as another for a beginning.\n\nAt first glance Parkinson was struck by the strange familiarity of\nthis chamber: then, after a moment, he recognized it. A tall,\nhigh-backed metal chair in its center was its mark of identification.\nThis was the chamber wherein the Venerians had transferred a record of\nhis knowledge to their minds.\n\nCarefully he looked around in search of a weapon, but the room held\nnothing but the chair and the thought transference device. In a moment\nhe withdrew, closing the door behind him.\n\nIn the next room he entered, he was fortunate. This chamber was filled\nwith strange devices of various kinds. While curiously inspecting the\nintricate machines, he saw something that brought a smile of\nsatisfaction to his lips.\n\nAgainst one wall stood a tall, glass case, one of the shelves of which\nheld several metal devices that Parkinson immediately recognized as\nbeing the Venerians' weapons. Poignantly he remembered how a similar\ndevice had destroyed a ship.\n\nLeaving the door slightly ajar, he crossed to the case and secured one\nof the weapons. For a moment he studied it. There was nothing complex\nabout the mechanism; a cursory examination sufficed to reveal how it\nwas operated. Pressure on a little knob at the back of the handle\nreleased the devastating ray.\n\nHe was about to slip the device into his pocket when he stiffened\ninvoluntarily. There was a sound of movement outside the room--he\nheard a step on the metal floor--then he whirled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the Venerians stood in the doorway, a menacing frown on his\nface. He was crouching, ready to spring upon Parkinson.\n\nQuick as thought, the bacteriologist leveled his newly-acquired\nweapon, and pressed on the knob. There was a sudden spurt of flame\nfrom the Venerian's body; then it crumpled, sagging, shrinking\ntogether.\n\nHastily Parkinson released the pressure on the little knob, aghast at\nthe destructive power of his little weapon. Then, as he remembered the\ntorture he had endured at their hands, he directed the ray upon the\nashes, until they, too, were consumed, leaving naught but a dark patch\non the floor.\n\nFor several minutes Parkinson stood there in deep thought. There was\nno immediate danger from the two remaining Venerians, for they were\nup in the tower, while the sphere was in the meteor; so he could think\nwith utmost safety. Deep thought and careful planning were necessary\nnow, for he had taken the step that must mean either his death or the\ndeath of the Venerians.\n\nSuddenly he leaped into action; he had decided upon his next move.\nCrossing to the case he secured another weapon. He wasn't sure that\nthey could be effectively discharged without re-loading; handicapped\nas he was with one arm gone, he had to be certain of the reliability\nof his means of defense. Then he left the room, and crossed to the\nhuge thoque sphere.\n\nIt was the work of a moment to enter this, and prepare to ascend. This\ndone, he turned his attention to the numerous knobs on the wall. He\nhad not seen them for quite a while; it was with difficulty that he\nrecalled which knobs controlled the car's ascent. At last, hesitantly,\nbut correctly, he pressed on the knobs, and the sphere rose slowly\ntoward the surface.\n\nAt the proper moment, Parkinson, brought the vehicle to a halt, and\nslid back the door. Furtively he peered around. The Venerians were on\nthe other side of the tower. Quickly he lowered the ladder and\ndescended.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he stepped to the floor, a sudden cry of dismay fell upon his ears.\nOne of the Venerians, coming around the car, had discovered him.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Parkinson aimed his little weapon, and\npressed upon the knob. Like his fellow, the Venerian fell to the\nfloor, a heap of charred ashes.\n\nWith the second Venerian destroyed, Parkinson dashed around the\nsphere, metal cylinder held in readiness. The leader of the Venerians\nwas stealing stealthily around the other side of the car, his hand\nfumbling beneath his garment.\n\n\"Stop!\" Parkinson cried. \"Raise your hands above your head--empty!\" A\ncylinder clattered to the metal floor as the Venerian's hands moved\nskyward.\n\n\"Keep your back turned!\" Parkinson snapped as the invader began about.\n\"I won't hesitate to press on this little knob, at your first hostile\nmove! I'd thoroughly enjoy burning you to a crisp, so be very\ncareful.\"\n\nWhile talking, Parkinson had moved slowly toward the man from Venus;\nnow, almost upon him, he quickly dropped his weapon into a pocket, and\nswung a terrible blow at the base of his skull. The Venerian fell to\nthe floor without a groan, unconscious.\n\nParkinson stared at the recumbent figure rather dubiously for a\nmoment. If only he had his other arm! But it was gone; with an\nimpatient shake of his head he stooped and raised the senseless\ninvader.\n\nIt was anything but an easy task for the bacteriologist to carry his\nseven-foot burden up the ladder and into the sphere, but finally, he\nsucceeded in doing so. Then, without delay, he lowered the car into\nthe meteor again.\n\nAs he bore the Venerian from the vehicle, he tried to decide upon his\nnext move. Obviously, he had to secure the one surviving invader, so\nthat he would not be a menace to Parkinson when he revived. And then\nthe logical thing to do would be, in some way, to secure information\nfrom him as to how to cure the disease that was spreading over the\nworld.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe logical thing to do, yes--but how? With only one arm, the simple\ntask of binding the Venerian presented considerable difficulty. How\nmuch more difficult would it be to force anything from him?\n\nThen the solution of the first problem presented itself to Parkinson.\nWhat was to prevent his strapping this being into the high-backed\nchair to which he had been secured some time before? Quickly he\ncrossed the circular room to the door he had first passed through\nwhile searching for a weapon.\n\nTen minutes later, when the Venerian regained his senses, he was\nfastened securely to the tall, metal chair.\n\n\"Well,\" Parkinson addressed him, \"conditions seem to be reversed now,\nand you're the underdog. I've nipped your invasion in the bud. All\nyour elaborate preparations are wasted.\"\n\nSomething resembling a sneer wreathed the Venerian's thin lips; a\nmocking gleam lit his cold, blue eyes.\n\n\"So our efforts have been wasted, have they? I'm afraid I can't agree\nwith you. Already, enough bacteria have been released to destroy all\nlife, though it will take longer than we desire. Even though you kill\nme, our goal will still be reached. The human race will die!\"\n\nA cloud of gloom fell upon Parkinson. He had expected this; but he had\nbeen hoping that he was wrong.\n\n\"Then there's only one thing for me to do, and that is: I'll have to\nforce you to tell me how to undo the damage you've done.\"\n\nThe Venerian smiled mirthlessly. \"You have absolutely no chance of\naccomplishing that,\" he said. \"We've done our work too well to allow\nany interference now.\n\n\"You do not know this, but we have released upon your world the worst\nmalady ever known to Venus. There is only one remedy; and I'm the only\none who knows it, or who has the means wherewith to accomplish it. And\nI certainly won't tell!\"\n\nThe worried expression on Parkinson's face increased in intensity.\nThere was something in the Venerian's voice that convinced him that he\nmeant what he said.\n\nThen suddenly his countenance cleared, and a happy smile replaced his\nfrown.\n\n\"Perhaps you won't tell, but I think you will. There are more ways\nthan one of forcing you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nParkinson had hit upon a solution to his problem. The Venerians had\nreproduced his knowledge in their brains; why wouldn't it be possible\nfor him to reverse the operation?\n\nIn a moment he secured the thought-transference apparatus from a case\nin the rear of the room, and bore it to the chair, and in spite of the\nVenerian leader's struggles, placed it upon his head. He put the\nhead-phones over his own ears, and began fumbling with the controls.\n\nSuddenly he seemed to strike the right combination. There was a faint,\nhumming drone in his ears; after a moment this was replaced by a loud\ncrackling--and the knowledge of the man from Venus was becoming his\nown.\n\nSomewhat dazed, Parkinson shut off the current. His mind was in a\nturmoil. He was in possession of knowledge of such an amazing\ncharacter that, for the moment he had lost his mental equilibrium.\nIndeed, so strange was his new-found knowledge, that he could not\ngrasp the significance of even half of the facts in his mind.\n\nBut already, he knew how, with animal electricity, they had paralyzed\nhim; knew what had happened to him on the operating table; knew the\nnature of the dread disease that destroyed his arm; the Gray\nPlague--and knew the cure!\n\nA sudden thought arrested this review of his new knowledge. The Gray\nPlague! At that very moment incalculable quantities of the deadly\nbacilli were being cast into the air. And he was doing nothing about\nit!\n\nHe glanced at the Venerian. He was still unconscious, and would remain\nso for some minutes to come. And even if he did recover his senses, he\nwas securely fastened to the chair; Parkinson dashed out of the room,\ncrossed to the sphere, and passed through the open doorway.\n\nWithout hesitation he manipulated the controls, directed by his\nVenerian knowledge. Rapidly the sphere rose to the surface.\n\nAs it came to rest on the floor of the tower, Parkinson sprang from\nthe car, and headed toward a mass of intricate machinery that filled\nfully a quarter of the great building.\n\nEven this caused him no great concern; he was as familiar with it as\nhe would have been had he constructed it. For some moments he was busy\nwith numerous dials and levers; then the release of the germs was\nstopped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nParkinson spent several minutes in examining the contents of the\ntower, his Earthly mind lost in wonder at the strange things his\nVenerian knowledge revealed to him. Then he entered the sphere again,\nand sank into the meteor.\n\nAs he moved toward the room that held the Venerian, his mind was busy\nwith conjectures as to what he would do with his prisoner. It was\nnecessary for the bacteriologist to reach the mainland as quickly as\npossible, and make use of his knowledge of the cure for the Gray\nPlague. He didn't want to kill the man; he couldn't free him; yet if\nhe left him strapped to the chair, he'd surely die of starvation.\n\nStill undecided, he thrust open the door. With a startled gasp he\nstopped short. Somehow the Venerian had freed himself; at that moment\nhe leaped toward Parkinson.\n\nInstinctively the bacteriologist flung up his hand in a defensive\nattitude. The onrushing Venerian caught Parkinson's out-thrust fist in\nthe pit of his stomach, and doubled up in pain. While he was thus\ndefenseless, Parkinson placed a well-directed blow on the side of the\nVenerian's jaw, a blow carrying every ounce of his strength.\n\nSo great was the force of the punch, that it lifted the man from Venus\nand cast him headlong upon the floor. His head landed with a sickening\nthud. Unmoving, he lay where he had fallen.\n\nParkinson knelt over him for a moment, then arose. Without question,\nthe man was dead. The Venerian had solved the bacteriologist's last\nproblem; he was free to return to the United States with his means of\nsaving mankind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrawing the little metal cylinder from his pocket, he burned the body\nof the Venerian leader to a heap of ashes, ridding the world of the\nlast invader. Then he turned and entered the glass-lined operating\nroom.\n\nFollowing the dictates of his Venerian knowledge, he crossed to one of\nthe walls, and drew therefrom a flat, glass vessel, somewhat like a\npetri dish. This contained bacteria that were harmless in themselves,\nand were hostile to those of the Gray Plague. These germs, brought\nfrom Venus, were the only cure for the terrible disease.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: The work of the English bacteriologist Twort, in 1915,\nand the Frenchman, d'Herelle, in 1917, brought to the attention of the\nscientific world the fact that many bacteria are subject to attack and\ndestruction by some unknown active agent with which they are\nassociated in infected material. This agent, whatever its character,\nchanged growing germ cultures to a dead, glassy substance.\n\nTwort advanced the thought that the agent might be a living, filtered\nvirus, although he favored the theory that it was an enzyme derived\nfrom the bacteria themselves.\n\nD'Herelle, on the contrary, believed that this phenomenon was due to a\nliving, multiplying, ultra-microscopic microbe that destroyed certain\nbacteria.\n\nEvidence favoring both theories has come to light, with the result\nthat, at present, controversy is rife. Up to date, the contention of\nneither side has been proved.]\n\nParkinson's adventure was almost at an end. He had not emerged\nunscathed, but he had won!\n\nThe details of his further actions need not be recorded. Suffice it to\nsay that he entered the sphere, carrying his precious, curative germs,\narose to the top of the tower, and passed through a round opening in\nits side. His borrowed knowledge revealed that the car possessed\nabilities that he had not suspected; with amazing speed he caused it\nto flash across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States.\n\nThere he saw the frightful carnage that the Plague had caused, saw the\ndeserted cities--and was filled with self-reproach because he had not\nacted sooner.\n\nAcross the miles and miles of deserted country he sped, following the\nfleeing hordes, finally passing over the stragglers and landing in\nthe heart of the congested areas. After making a few inquiries, he\nreturned to the sphere, and continued on toward the West. He landed,\nfinally, outside the city of San Francisco.\n\nA short time later, twisted, deformed, yet triumphant, he was ushered\ninto the presence of the United States government as--the man who had\nsaved the human race.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe terrible days of the Gray Plague ended in mystery. Much that had\npuzzled the world, Parkinson, with his Venerian knowledge, explained;\nbut there was one thing, the final, enigmatical act in the strange\ndrama, that was as much of a mystery to him as it was to the rest of\nthe world.\n\nEnigma! Of what significance, of what portent--who could tell?\n\nWhen the great vessel from the United States, equipped to destroy the\nmeteor of the Venetians, neared the great thoque sphere, they came\nupon a scene quite different from what they had expected. Parkinson,\nwho was on the ship, was more surprised than the rest, for he had\ndefinite knowledge of what, in the natural course of events, they\nshould see. For the others there was nothing so very strange in what\nthey saw; Parkinson had lied, that was all.\n\nWhen the bacteriologist had left the meteor, there had been a high,\nbronze-colored tower, a burnished lighthouse, covering its entire top.\nIt had been there--but now it was gone! Only the jagged, arched\nsurface of the meteor remained.\n\nThey lowered boats and rowed to the strange island. There they saw\nsomething that filled them--Parkinson especially--with a very definite\nuneasiness. The entire top of the meteor was a twisted, fire-blasted\nmass of bronze-like metal. Where the tower had been, where the shaft\nhad led into the remarkable interplanetary vehicle, there was now a\nbroken expanse of thoque that flashed fire under the rays of the sun.\n\nSomething seemed to have melted, to have fused the tower, until it had\ncrumpled, and had run, filling the entrance of the meteor. There was\nirrefutable evidence to that effect; no one thought otherwise.\n\nBut what agency had done this strange thing?\n\nSomeone suggested that it might have been the work of some prearranged\nmechanism. Parkinson shook his head. Had such been the case, his\nVenerian knowledge would have told him so.\n\nObviously, nothing of Earth had done it, nothing of Earth--then\nsomething of Venus! Inconclusive conjecture, perhaps, but no other\nexplanation offered itself. Something had sealed the contents of the\nmeteor from the sight of man, something with a purpose. From Venus?\nThe thought was logical, to say the least.\n\nNot for long did they remain there beside the Venerian vehicle; there\nwas naught for them to do, so they turned about and headed toward the\nUnited States. They bore tidings that were vaguely disturbing, tidings\nthat none were glad to hear. For, according to all indications,\nsomething alien to Earth was still within her confines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind it all--the meteors, the Plague, the sealing of the Venerian\nvehicle--is one fact of great significance. No longer is man alone in\nthe universe; no longer is he in isolation! Out of space came a\nmenace, an intelligence striving to wrest from him his right to rule\nover Earth. No longer can man in his smug complacency think of himself\nas being secure in his strength. He has been shown the utter folly of\nsuch thinking.\n\nThe menace--the invaders from Venus--came, and were destroyed, their\npurposes defeated. Yet--in the vast reaches of space, in worlds of\nother dimensions, in the cosmic crucible of life that embodies all\ncreation, there may be other forms of life, other menaces, hovering\nclouds of death, preparing to sweep down upon Earth to snuff out her\nlife. Who can tell?\n\nAnd who may say that man is free from the Venerian danger? The strange\nsealing of the meteor implies that the menace is still present. Who\nknows but what those inhuman Venerian brutes may even now be planning\nsome new invasion, may be preparing to renew their attack upon Earth?\n\nTime alone will tell.\n\n\nROBOT PILOTS FOR AIRCRAFT\n\nPerfection of an automatic mechanical piloting mechanism for airplanes\nhas been achieved after several years of experiment at the royal\naircraft establishment of Farnborough.\n\nThe apparatus has been successfully tried out on various types of\nplanes--two-seater day bombers, large twin-engine night bombers and\nbig flying boats. Its use as a second or relief pilot on long distance\nflights by Royal Air Force machines is now being considered.\n\nIn every test the robot pilot has steered an accurate course for hours\nat a time and over distances up to 400 miles while human members of\nthe crew have been concerned with other duties.\n\nThe basis of the mechanical pilot is a gyroscope that controls pistons\nconnected with the rudder and elevators of the plane. These pistons\nare actuated by compressed air.\n\nOnce a course is set the robot pilot keeps the machine on that route\nand errors of even a fraction of a degree are instantly and\nautomatically detected and corrected. All the human pilot has to do in\na plane so equipped is to take off and land the machine.\n\nThe Pilot's Assister is the official name of the new English device.\nIt weighs about 120 pounds.\n\nFlights have been made with the mechanical pilot in all sorts of\nweather. In dense fog and clouds, when a human pilot would have found\nit almost impossible to maintain straight or level flight because of\nthe absence of any visible horizon by which to steer, the mechanical\npilot flew the plane with absolute accuracy. On one test flight the\nautomatic pilot steered a dead true course from Farnborough in South\nEngland, to Newcastle, 270 miles farther north. The human pilot did\nnot touch the controls until it was necessary to land the plane at the\ndestination.\n\n\n\n\nJetta of the Lowlands\n\nConclusion\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\n[Sidenote: Black-garbed figures move in ghastly greenness as the\ninvisible flyer speeds on its business of ransom.]\n\n[Illustration: _Hans and I hauled out the heavy casket._]\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n_In the Bandit Camp_\n\nThe dark cave, with its small spots of tube-light mounted upon movable\ntripods, was eery with grotesque swaying shadows. The bandit camp.\nHidden down here in the depths of the Mid-Atlantic Lowlands. An\ninaccessible retreat, this cave in what once was the ocean floor. Only\na few years ago water had been here, water black and cold and\nsoundless. Tremendous pressure, with three thousand or more fathoms of\nthe ocean above it. Fishes had roamed these passages, no doubt.\nStrange monsters of the deeps: sightless, or with eyes like\nphosphorescent torches.\n\nBut the water was gone now. Blue ooze was caked upon the cave floor.\nEroded walls; niches and tiny gullies; crevices and an arching dome\nhigh overhead. A fantastic cave--no one, seeing it as I saw it that\nmorning at dawn, could have believed it was upon this earth. From\nwhere De Boer had put me--on the flat top of a small, butte-like dome\nnear the upper end of the sloping cave floor--all the area of this\nstrange bandit camp was visible to me.\n\nA little tent of parchment was set upon the dome-top.\n\n\"Yours,\" said De Boer, with a grin. \"Make yourself comfortable.\nGutierrez will be your willing servant, until we see about this\nransom. It will have to be one very large, for you are a damn trouble\nto me, Grant. And a risk. Food will come shortly. Then you can sleep:\nI think you will want it.\"\n\nHe leaped from the little butte, leaving the taciturn ever-watchful\nGutierrez sitting cross-legged on the ledge near me, with his\nprojector across his knees.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cave was irregularly circular, with perhaps, a hundred-feet\ndiameter and a ceiling fifty feet high. A drift of the fetid, Lowland\nair went through it--into a rift at this upper end, and out through\nthe lower passage entrance which sloped downward thirty feet and\ndebouched upon a rippled ramp of ooze outside. It was daylight out\nthere now. From my perch I could see the sullen heavy walls of a\nridge. Mist hung against them, but the early morning sunlight came\ndown in shafts penetrating the mist and striking the oily surface of a\nspread of water left here in the depths of a cauldron.\n\nDe Boer's flyer was outside. We had landed by the shore of the sea,\nand the bandits had pushed the vehicle into an arching recess which\nseemed as though made to hide it. All this camp was hidden. Arching\ncrags of the ridge-wall jutted out over the cave entrance. From above,\nany passing flyer--even though well below the zero-height--would see\nnothing but this black breathing sea, lapping against its eroded,\nfantastic shore-line.\n\nWithin the cave, there was only a vague filtering daylight from the\nlower entrance, a thin shaft from the rift overhead, and the blue\ntube-light, throwing great shadows of the tents and the men against\nthe black rock walls.\n\nThere seemed perhaps a hundred of the bandits here. A semi-permanent\ncamp, by its aspect. Grey parchment tents were set up about the floor,\nsome small, others more elaborate. It seemed as though it were a\nhuddled little group of buildings in the open air, instead of in a\ncave. One tent, just at the foot of my dome, seemed De Boer's personal\nroom. He went into it after leaving me, and came out to join the main\ngroup of his fellows near the center of the cave where a large\nelectron stove, and piped water from a nearby subterranean freshet,\nand a long table set with glassware and silver, stood these men for\nkitchen and eating place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe treasure had not yet been brought in from the flyer. But, from\nwhat I overheard, it seemed that the radiumized ingots of the\nill-fated Spawn and Perona were to be stored for a year at least, here\nin this cave. I could see the strong-room cubby. It was hewn from the\nrock of the cave wall, its sealed-grid door-oval set with metal bars.\n\nI saw also what seemed a small but well-equipped machine shop, in a\nrecess room at one side of the cave. Men were working in there under\nthe light of tubes. And there was a niche hollowed out in the wall to\nmake a room for De Boer's instruments--ether-wave receivers and\ntransmitters, the aerial receiving wires of which stretched in banks\nalong the low ceiling.\n\nThere was no activity in there now, except for one man who was\noperating what I imagined might be an aerial insulator, guarding the\nplace from any prying search-vibrations.\n\nThe main cave was a bustle of activity. The arriving bandits were\ngreeting their fellows and exchanging news. The men who had been left\nhere were jubilant at the success of the Chief's latest enterprise.\nBottles were unsealed and they began to prepare the morning meal.\n\nMy presence caused considerable comment. I was a complication at which\nmost of the men were ill pleased, especially when the arriving bandits\ntold who I was, and that the patrols of the United States were\ndoubtless even now trying to find me.\n\nBut De Boer silenced the grumbling with rough words.\n\n\"My business, not yours. But you will take your share of his ransom,\nwon't you? Have done!\"\n\nAnd Jetta, she had caused comment also. But when the bottles were well\ndistributed the grumbling turned to ribald banter which made me\nshudder that it should fall upon Jetta's ears. De Boer had kept his\nmen away from her, shoving them aside when they crowded to see her.\nShe was in a little tent now, not far from the base of my ledge.\n\nMy meal presently was brought from where most of the bandits now were\nroistering at the long table in the center of the cave.\n\n\"Eat,\" said Gutierrez. \"I eat with you, Americano. _Madre Mia_, when\nyou are ransomed away from here it will please me! De Boer is fool,\nwith taking such a chance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the meal ended, another guard came to take Gutierrez' place and I\nwas ordered into my tent. The routine of the camp, it seemed, was to\nuse the daylight hours for the time of sleep. There were lookouts and\nguards at the entrance, and a little arsenal of ready weapons stocked\nin the passage. The men at the table were still at their meal. It\nwould end, I did not doubt, by most of them falling into heavy\nalcoholic slumber.\n\nI was tired, poisoned by the need of sleep. I lay on fabric cushions\npiled in one corner of my tent. But sleep would not come; my thoughts\nran like a tumbling mountain torrent, and as aimlessly. I hoped that\nJetta was sleeping. De Boer was now at the center table with his men.\nHans was guarding Jetta. He was a phlegmatic, heavy Dutchman, and\nseemed decent enough.\n\nI wondered what Hanley might be doing to rescue me. But as I thought\nabout it, I could only hope that his patrols would not find us out\nhere. An attack and most certainly De Boer and his men in their anger\nwould kill me out of hand. And possibly Jetta also.\n\nI had not had a word alone with Jetta since that scene in the control\nroom. When we disembarked, she had stayed close by De Boer. But I knew\nthat Jetta had fathomed my purpose, that she was working to the same\nend. We must find a way of arranging the ransom which would give us an\nopportunity to escape.\n\nI pondered it. And at last an idea came to me, vague in all its\ndetails, as yet. But it seemed feasible, and I thought it would sound\nplausible to De Boer. I would watch my chance and explain it to him.\nThen I realized how much aid Jetta would be. She would agree with my\nplan, and help me convince him. And when the crucial time came, though\nI would be a captive, watched by Gutierrez, bound and gagged,\nperhaps--Jetta would be at liberty. De Boer and Gutierrez would not be\non their guard with her.\n\nI drifted off to sleep, working out the details of my plan.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n_Planning The Ransom_\n\nI was awakened by the sound of low voices outside my tent. Jetta's\nvoice, and De Boer's, and, mingled with them, the babble of the still\nhilarious bandits in the center of the cave. But there were only a few\nleft now; most of them had fallen into heavy slumber. I had been\nasleep for several hours, I figured. The daylight shadows outside the\ncave entrance showed that it was at least noon.\n\nI lay listening to the voices which had awakened me. De Boer was\nsaying:\n\n\"But why, Jetta, should I bother with your ideas? I know what is best.\nThis ransom is too dangerous to arrange.\" His voice sounded calmly\ngood humored; I could hear in it now more than a trace of alcoholic\ninfluence. He added, \"I think we had better kill him and have done. My\nmen think so, too; already I have caused trouble with them, by\nbringing him.\"\n\nIt jolted me into full wakefulness.\n\nJetta's voice: \"No! I tell you it can be arranged, Hendrick. I have\nbeen thinking of it, planning it--\"\n\n\"Child! Well what? The least I can do is listen; I am no pig-headed\nAmerican. Say it out. What would you do to ransom him safely?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were just at the foot of my ledge, in front of De Boer's tent.\nTheir voices rose so that I could hear them plainly. For all my start\nat being awakened to hear my death determined upon, I recall that I\nwas almost equally startled by Jetta's voice. Her tone, her manner\nwith De Boer. Whatever opportunities they had had for talking\ntogether, the change in their relationship was remarkable. De Boer was\nnow flushed with drink, but for all that he had obviously still a firm\ngrip upon his wits. And I heard Jetta now urging her ideas upon him\nwith calm confidence. An outward confidence; yet under it there was a\nvibrant emotion suppressed within her even tone; a hint of tremulous\nfright; a careful calculation of the effect she might be making upon\nDe Boer. Had he not been intoxicated--with drink and with her--he\nmight have sensed it. But he did not.\n\n\"Hendrick, it can be done. A big price. Why not?\"\n\n\"Because if we are trapped and caught, of what use is the price we\nmight have gotten? Tell me that, wise one?\"\n\n\"We will not be trapped. And suppose you kill him--won't they track\nyou just the same, Hendrick?\"\n\n\"No. We would leave his body on some crag where it would be found. The\npatrols would more quickly tire of chasing a killer when the damage is\ndone. They want Grant alive.\"\n\n\"Then let them have him alive--for a big price. Hendrick, listen--\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" he demanded again. \"What is your plan?\"\n\n\"Why--well, Hendrick, like this--\"\n\nShe stammered, and I realized that she had no plausible plan. She was\nfumbling, groping, urging upon De Boer that I must be ransomed alive.\nBut she had not good reason for it.\n\n\"Well?\" he prompted impatiently.\n\n\"You--can you raise Great New York on the audiphone, Hendrick?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Hanley's office?\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt. Chah--that would give him a start, wouldn't it? De\nBoer calmly calling him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was laughing. I heard what sounded as though he were gulping\nanother drink. \"By damn, Jetta, you are not the timid bird you look.\nCall Hanley, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes. Can it be done and still bar his instruments from locating us?\"\n\n\"Yes, and bar his television. Believe it, Jetta. I have every device\nfor hiding. But--call Hanley!\"\n\n\"Why not? ... Hendrick, stop!\"\n\nI started. It seemed that he was embracing her; forcing half drunken\ncaresses upon her.\n\nI scrambled through my tent doorway, but Gutierrez, who had come back\non guard, at once seized me.\n\n\"_Hui_--so haste! Back, you.\"\n\nThe Spaniard spoke softly, and he was grinning. \"The chief plays with\nwoman's words, no? Charming se\u00f1orita, though she dresses like a boy.\nBut that is the more charming, eh? Listen to her, Grant.\"\n\nHe gripped me, and prodded my side with the point of his knife blade.\n\"Lie down Americano: we will listen.\"\n\nJetta was insisting. \"Hendrick, stop!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could see them now. They were seated before the opening of De Boer's\ntent. A little stove in front of them. Coffee for Jetta, who was\nseated cross-legged, pouring it; a bowl of drink for De Boer. And some\nbaked breadstuff dainties on a platter.\n\n\"Hendrick--\"\n\nShe pushed him away as he leaned to embrace her. Although she was\nlaughing with him, I could only guess at the chill of fear that might\nbe in her heart.\n\n\"Foolish, Hendrick!\"\n\n\"Foolish little bird, Jetta mine.\"\n\n\"You--it is you who are foolish, Hendrick.\" She slid from his embrace\nand held her brimming coffee cup balanced before her, to ward him off.\n\"You think I am really clever, so trust me, Hendrick. Oh there is a\ngreat future for us: you say I inspire you; let me! Hendrick De Boer,\nChieftain of the Lowlands! My father would have helped you become\nthat. You can build a little empire. Hendrick--why not? Father wanted\nto make you President of Nareda. Why not build your own Lowland\nEmpire? We have a hundred men now? Why not gather a thousand? Ten\nthousand? An empire!\"\n\n\"_Ave Maria_,\" from Gutierrez. \"This _ni\u00f1a_ thinks big thoughts!\"\n\nDe Boer raised his bowl. \"An empire--De Boer of the Lowlands! Go on;\nyou amuse me. We have a nice start, with this treasure.\"\n\n\"Yes. And the ransom money. But you will take me first to Cape Town,\nHendrick? We can be married there: I am seventeen in a month.\"\n\n\"Of course, Jetta. Haven't I promised?\" There was no convincingness to\nme in the way he said it. \"Of course. To Cape Town for our marriage.\"\n\n\"Stop! Hendrick, be serious!\" He had reached for her again. \"Don't be\na fool, Hendrick.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"I am all serious. What is your plan?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was more resourceful this time. She retorted, \"This craven Grant,\nhe fears for his life--but he is very smart, Hendrick. I think he is\nscheming every moment how he can be safely ransomed.\"\n\n\"Hah! No doubt of that!\"\n\n\"And he has had experience with Chief Hanley. He knows Hanley's\nmethods, how Hanley will act. Let us see what Grant says of this.\"\n\nShe had no plan of her own, but she hoped that by now I had one! And\nshe was making an opportunity for me to put it before De Boer.\n\nHe said, \"There is sense to that, Jetta. If there is any way to fool\nHanley, that craven American has no doubt thought it out.\"\n\nShe held another drink before him. \"Yes. Let us see what he says.\"\n\nHe drank; and again as they were near together he caressed her.\n\n\"What a schemer you are, little bird. You and I are well matched, eh?\"\n\n\"Gutierrez may be watching us!\" she warned.\n\nThey suddenly looked up and saw Gutierrez and me.\n\n\"Hah!\" Fortunately it struck De Boer into further good humor. \"Hah--we\nhave an audience! Bring down the prisoner, Gutierrez! Let us see if\nhis wits can get him out of this plight. Come down, Grant!\"\n\nGutierrez shoved me down the ladder ahead of him. De Boer stood up and\nseized me. His great fingers dug into my shoulders.\n\n\"Sit down, American! It seems you are not to die. _Perhaps_ not.\"\n\nThe strength of his fingers was hurting me: he hoped I would wince.\nMine was now an ignominious role, indeed, yet I knew it was best.\n\nI gasped. \"Don't do that: you hurt!\"\n\nHe chuckled and cast me loose. I added, with a show of spirit, \"You\nare a bullying giant. Just because you are bigger than I am--\"\n\n\"Hear that, Jetta? The American finds courage with his coming ransom!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shoved me to the ground. Gutierrez grinned, and withdrew a trifle.\nJetta avoided meeting my gaze.\n\n\"Have some coffee,\" De Boer offered. \"Alcohol is not good for you. Now\nsay: have you any suggestions on how I can safely ransom you?\"\n\nIt seemed that Jetta was holding her breath with anxiety. But I\nanswered with an appearance of ready eagerness. \"Yes. I have. I can\narrange it with complete safety to you, if you give me a chance.\"\n\n\"You've got your chance. Speak out.\"\n\n\"You promise you will return me alive? Not hurt me?\"\n\n\"De duvel--yes! You have my promise. But your plan had better be very\ngood.\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nI told it carefully. The details of it grew with my words. Jetta\njoined in it. But, most of all, it did indeed sound feasible. \"But it\nmust be done at once,\" I urged. \"The weather is right; to-night it\nwill be dark; overcast; not much wind. Don't you think so?\"\n\nHe sent Gutierrez to the cave's instrument room to read the weather\nforecast instruments. My guess was right.\n\n\"To-night then,\" I said. \"If we linger, it only gives Hanley more time\nto plan trickery.\"\n\n\"Let us try and raise him now,\" Jetta suggested.\n\nThe Dutchman, Hans, had joined us. He too, seemed to think my ideas\nwere good.\n\nExcept for the guards at the cave entrance, all the other bandits were\nfar gone in drink. With Hans and Gutierrez, we went to the instrument\nroom to call Hanley. As we crossed the cave, with Hans and De Boer\nwalking ahead together, De Boer spoke louder than he realized, and the\nwords came back to me.\n\n\"Not so bad, Hans? We will use him--but I am not a fool. I'll send him\nback dead, not alive! A little knife-thrust, just at the end! Safest\nfor us, eh, Hans?\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n_Within the Black Sack_\n\nWe left the bandit stronghold just after nightfall that same day.\nThere were five of us on the X-flyer. Jetta and De Boer, Hans and\nGutierrez and myself. The negotiations with Hanley had come through\nsatisfactorily; to De Boer, certainly, for he was in a triumphant mood\nas they cast off the aero and we rose over the mist-hung depths.\n\nIt was part of my plan, this meager manning of the bandit ship. But it\nwas mechanically practical: there was only Hans needed at the controls\nfor this short-time flight: with De Boer plotting his course, working\nout his last details--and with Gutierrez to guard me.\n\nDe Boer had been quite willing to take no other men--and most of them\nwere too far gone in their cups to be of much use. I never have\nfathomed De Boer's final purpose. He promised Jetta now that when I\nwas successfully ransomed he would proceed to Cape Town by comfortable\nnight flights and marry her. It pleased Gutierrez and Hans, for they\nwanted none of their comrades. The treasure was still on the flyer.\nThe ransom gold would be added to it. I think that De Boer, Gutierrez\nand Hans planned never to return to their band. Why, when the treasure\ndivided so nicely among three, break it up to enrich a hundred?\n\nI shall never forget Hanley's grim face as we saw it that afternoon on\nDe Boer's image-grid. My chief sat at his desk with all his location\ndetectors impotent, listening to my disembodied voice explaining what\nI wanted him to do. My humble, earnest, frightened desire to be\nransomed safely at all costs! My plea that he do nothing to try and\ntrap De Boer!\n\nIt hurt me to appear so craven. But with it all, I knew that Hanley\nunderstood. He could imagine my leering captor standing at my elbow,\nprompting my words, dictating my very tone--prodding me with a knife\nin the ribs. I tried, by every shade of meaning, to convey to Hanley\nthat I hoped to escape and save the ransom money. And I think that he\nguessed it, though he was wary in the tone he used for De Boer to\nhear. He accepted, unhesitatingly, De Boer's proposition: assured us\nhe would do nothing to assail De Boer; and never once did his grim\nface convey a hint of anything but complete acquiescence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had President Markes on the circuit. De Boer, with nothing to lose,\npromised to return Jetta with me. In gold coin, sixty thousand U. S.\ndollar-standards for me; a third as much from Nareda, for Jetta.\n\nThe details were swiftly arranged. We cut the circuit. I had a last\nlook at Hanley's face as the image of it faded. He seemed trying to\ntell me to do the best I could; that he was powerless, and would do\nnothing to jeopardize my life and Jetta's. Everything was ready for\nthe affair to be consummated at once. The weather was right; there was\ntime for Hanley and De Boer each comfortably to reach the assigned\nmeeting place.\n\nWe flew, for the first hour, nearly due west. The meeting place was at\n35 deg. N. by 59 deg. W., a few hundred miles east by north of the\nfairy-like mountaintop of the Bermudas. Our charts showed the Lowlands\nthere to run down to what once was measured as nearly three thousand\nfathoms--called now eighteen thousand feet below the zero-height. A\nbroken region, a depth-ridge fairly level, and no Lowland sea, nor\nany settlements in the neighborhood.\n\nThe time was set at an hour before midnight. No mail, passenger or\nfreight flyers were scheduled to pass near there at that hour, and,\nsave for some chance private craft, we would be undisturbed. The\nransom gold was available to Hanley. He had said he would bring it in\nhis personal Wasp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe details of the exchange were simple. Hanley, with only one\nmechanic, would hover at the zero-height, his Wasp lighted so that we\ncould see it plainly. The wind drift, according to forecast, would be\nsoutherly. At 11 P.M. Hanley would release from his Wasp a small\nhelium-gas baloon-car--a ten-foot basket with the supporting gas bag\nabove it, weighted so that it would slowly descend into the depths,\nwith a southern drift.\n\nOur flyer, invisible and soundless, would pick up the baloon-car at\nsome point in its descent. The gold would be there, in a black casket.\nDe Boer would take the gold, deposit Jetta and me in the car, and\nrelease it again. And when the balloon finally settled to the rocks\nbeneath, Hanley could pick it up. No men would be hidden by Hanley in\nthat basket. De Boer had stipulated that when casting loose the\nballoon, its car must be swept by Hanley with a visible electronic\nray. No hidden men could withstand that blast!\n\nSuch was the arrangement with Hanley. I was convinced that he intended\nto carry it out to the letter. He would have his own invisible X-flyer\nin the neighborhood, no doubt. But it would not interfere with the\nsafe transfer of Jetta and me.\n\nThat De Boer would carry out his part, Hanley could only trust. He had\nsaid so this afternoon bluntly. And De Boer had laughed and interposed\nhis voice in our circuit.\n\n\"Government money against these two lives, Hanley! Of course you have\nto trust me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a flight, for us, of something less than four hours to the\nmeeting place. Hans was piloting, seated alone in the little cubby\nupon the forward wing-base, directly over the control room. De Boer,\nwith Jetta at his side, worked over his course and watched his\ninstrument banks. I was, at the start of the flight, lashed in a chair\nof the control room, my ankles and wrists tied and Gutierrez guarding\nme.\n\nJetta did not seem to notice me. She did not look at me, nor I at her.\nShe pretended interest only in the success of the transfer; in her\nfather's treasure on board, the coming ransom money, and then a flight\nto Cape Town, dividing the treasure only with Hans and Gutierrez; and\nin her marriage with De Boer. She said she wanted me returned to\nHanley alive; craven coward that I was, still I did not deserve death.\nDe Boer had agreed. But I knew that at last, as they tumbled me into\nthe basket, someone would slip a knife into me!\n\nI had, as we came on board, just the chance for a few whispered\nsentences with Jetta. But they were enough! We both knew what we had\nto do. Desperate expedient, indeed! It seemed more desperate now as\nthe time approached than it had when I planned it.\n\nThe weather at 7 P.M. was heavily overcast. Sultry, breathless, with\nsolid, wide-flung cloud areas spread low over the zero-height. Night\nsettled black in the Lowlands. The mists gathered.\n\nWe flew well down--under the minus two thousand-foot level--so that\nout of the mists the highest dome peaks often passed close beneath us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt 8 P.M. De Boer flung on the mechanism of invisibility. The interior\nof the ship faded to its gruesome green darkness. My senses reeled as\nthe current surged through me. Lashed in my chair, I sat straining my\nadjusting eyes, straining my hearing to cope with this gruesome\nunreality. And my heart was pounding. Would Jetta and I succeed? Or\nwas our love--unspoken love, born of a glance and the pressure of our\nhands in that moonlit Nareda garden--was our love star-crossed,\nforedoomed to tragedy? A few hours, now, would tell us.\n\nDe Boer was taking no chances. He was using his greatest intensity of\npower, with every safeguard for complete invisibility and silence.\nFrom where I sat I could make out the black form of Hans through the\nceiling grid, at his pilot controls in the overhead cubby. A queer\nglow like an aura was around him. The same green radiance suffused the\ncontrol room. It could not penetrate the opened windows of the ship;\ncould not pass beyond the electro-magnetic field enveloping us. Nor\ncould the curious hum which permeated the ship's interior get past the\nbarrage barrier. From outside, I knew, we were invisible and\ninaudible.\n\nStrange unreality, here in the control room! The black-garbed figures\nof De Boer and Jetta at their table were unreal, spectral. At the door\noval, which I could barely see, Gutierrez lurked like a shadow. All of\nthem, and Hans in the cubby above, were garbed in tight-fitting\ndead-black suits of silklene fabric. Thin, elastic as sheer silk web,\nopaque, lustreless. It covered their feet, legs and bodies; and their\narms and hands like black, silk gloves. Their heads were helmeted with\nit. And they had black masks which as yet were flapped up and fastened\nto the helmet above their foreheads. Their faces only were exposed,\ntinted a ghastly, lurid green by this strange light. It glowed and\nglistened like phosphorescence on their eyeballs, making them the eyes\nof animals in a hunter's torchlight, at night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDe Boer moved upon an errand across the control room. He was a burly\nblack spectre in the skin-tight suit. His footfalls faintly sounded on\nthe metal floor. They were toneless footfalls. Unreal. They might\nhave been bells, or jangling thuds; they had lost their identity in\nthis soundless, vibrating hum.\n\nAnd he spoke, \"We are making good progress, Jetta. We will be on\ntime.\"\n\nGhastly voice! So devoid of every human timbre, every overtone shade\nto give it meaning, that it might have been a man's voice, or a\nwoman's, the voice of something living, or something dead. Sepulchral.\nA stripped shell of voice. Yet to me, inside here with it, it was\nperfectly audible.\n\nAnd Jetta said, \"Yes, Hendrick, that is good.\"\n\nA voice like his: no different.\n\nGruesome. Weird.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI try now to picture the scene in detail, for out of these strange\nconditions Jetta and I were to make our opportunity.\n\n9 P.M. De Boer was a methodical fellow. He checked his position on the\nchart. He signalled the routine orders to Hans. And he gestured to\nGutierrez. The movements and acts of everyone had been definitely\nplanned. And this, too, Jetta and I had anticipated.\n\n\"Time to make him ready, Gutierrez. Bring the sack in here. I'll\nfasten him away.\"\n\nI was not garbed like the others. They could move out on the wing\nrunway under Hanley's eyes at short range, or climb in and out of the\nballoon car, and not be visible.\n\nGutierrez brought the sack. A dead-black fabric.\n\n\"Shall I cut him loose now from his chair, Commander?\"\n\n\"I'll do it.\"\n\nDe Boer drew a long knife blade, coated black, and thin and sharp as a\nhalf-length rapier. Gutierrez had one of similar fashion. No\nelectronic weapons were in evidence, probably because the hiss of one\nfired would have been too loud for our barrage, and its flash too\nbright. But a knife thrust is dark and silent!\n\nThe Spaniard's eyes were gleaming as he approached me with the bag,\nas though he were thinking of that silent knife thrust he would give\nme at the last.\n\nDr. Boer said, \"Stand up, Grant.\" He cut the fastenings that held me\nin my chair. But my ankles and wrists remained tied.\n\n\"Stand up, can't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got unsteadily to my feet. In the blurred green darkness I could see\nthat Jetta was not looking at me. Gutierrez held the mouth of the sack\nopen. As though I were an upright log of wood, De Boer lifted me.\n\n\"Pull it up over his feet, Gutierrez.\"\n\nThe oblong sack was longer than my body. They drew it over me, and\nbunched its top over my head. And De Boer laid me none too gently on\nthe floor.\n\n\"Lie still. Do you get enough air?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe black fabric was sufficiently porous for me to breathe comfortably\ninside the sack.\n\n\"All right, Gutierrez, I have the gag.\"\n\nI felt them carrying me from the control room, twenty feet or so along\nthe corridor, where a door-porte opened to a small balcony runway hung\nbeneath the forward wing. Jutting from it was a little take-off\nplatform some six feet by twelve in size. It was here that the\nballoon-basket was to be boarded. The casket containing the ransom\ngold would be landed here, and the sack containing me placed in the\ncar and cast loose. It was all within the area of invisibility of our\nflyer.\n\nDe Boer knelt over me, and drew back the top of the sack to expose my\nface.\n\n\"A little gag for you, Grant, so you will not be tempted to call out.\"\n\n\"I won't do that.\"\n\n\"You might. Well, good-by, American.\"\n\n\"Good-by.\" And I breathed, \"Good-by Jetta.\" Would I ever see her\nagain? Was this the end of everything for us?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe forced the gag into my mouth, tied it, and verified that my ankles\nand wrists were securely lashed. In the green radiance he and\nGutierrez were like ghouls prowling over me, and their muffled\ntoneless voices, tomblike.\n\nThe sack came up over my head.\n\n\"Good-by, Grant.\" I could not tell which one said it. And the other\nchuckled.\n\nI could feel them tying the mouth of the sack above my head. I lay\nstiff. Then I heard their steps. Then silence.\n\nI moved. I might have rolled, but I did not try it. I could raise my\nknees within the sack--double up like a folded pocket knife--but that\nwas all.\n\nA long, dark silence. It seemed interminable. Was Gutierrez guarding\nme here in the corridor? I could not tell; I heard nothing save the\nvague hum of the electronite current.\n\nIt had been 9 o'clock. Then I fancied that it must be 10. And then,\nperhaps, almost 11. I wondered what the weather outside was like. Soon\nwe would be nearing the meeting place. Would Hanley be there? Would\nJetta soon, very soon now, be able to do her part? I listened,\nhorribly tense, with every interval between the thumps of my heart\nseeming so long a gap of waiting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI heard a sound! A toneless, unidentifiable sound. Another like it; a\nlittle sequence of faint sounds. Growing louder. Approaching\nfootsteps? Jetta's? I prayed so.\n\nThen a low voice. Two voices. Both the same in quality. But from the\nwords I could identify them.\n\n\"Hello, Gutierrez.\"\n\n\"_Ni\u00f1a_, hello.\"\n\nJetta! She had come!\n\n\"The captive is safe? No trouble?\"\n\n\"No. He has not moved.\"\n\n\"Careful of him, Gutierrez. He is worth a lot of money to us.\"\n\n\"Well you say it. Se\u00f1orita. In half an hour now, we will be away.\nSanta Maria, when this is over I shall breathe with more comfort!\"\n\n\"We'll have no trouble, Gutierrez. We're almost there. In ten minutes\nnow, or a little more.\"\n\n\"So soon? What time is it?\"\n\n\"Well, after half-past ten. When it's over, Gutierrez, we head for\nCape Town. Clever of me, don't you think, to persuade Hendrick to take\nus to Cape Town? Just you three men to divide all this treasure. It\nwould be foolish to let a hundred others have it.\"\n\n\"True, _Ni\u00f1a_; true enough.\"\n\n\"I insisted upon you and Hans--Gutierrez, what is that?\"\n\nA silence.\n\n\"I heard nothing.\"\n\n\"A voice, was it?\"\n\n\"The Americano?\"\n\n\"No! No--the commander calling? Was it? Calling you, Gutierrez?\nPerhaps we have sighted Hanley's Wasp. Go! I'll stand here, and come\nquickly back.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFootsteps. Now! Our chance, come at last! I twisted over on my side,\nand lay motionless. Ah, if only those were Gutierrez' fading\nfootfalls! And Jetta, here alone with me in the green darkness! Just\nfor this one vital moment.\n\nFingers were fumbling at the top of my sack, unfastening the cord.\nHands and arms came swiftly in. Fingers ran down my back as I lay on\nmy side to admit them quickly. Fingers went fumbling at the cords that\nlashed my crossed wrists behind me. A knee pressed against me. A\nhurried, panting, half sobbing breath close over me--\n\nJust a hurried moment. The hands withdrew. The sack went back over my\nhead. The knees, the slight weight against me, was gone. A few seconds\nonly.\n\nFootsteps. The voices again.\n\n\"Was it the commander, Gutierrez?\"\n\n\"No. I do not know what it was. Nothing, probably.\"\n\n\"The Wasp in sight?\"\n\n\"Not yet, _Ni\u00f1a_. You had best go back: De Boer, he might be jealous\nof us, no? He is busy with his instruments, but should he realize you\nare here, talking with me--\"\n\n\"Senseless, Gutierrez!\"\n\n\"Is it so, _Ni\u00f1a_? I have no attraction? Go back to him. Gold I want,\nnot trouble over you!\"\n\nFaint laughter.\n\n\"When we sight the Wasp, I'll call and tell you, Gutierrez. Too bad\nyou won't let me stay with you. I like you.\"\n\n\"Yes. But go now!\"\n\nFaint laughter. Footsteps. Then silence.\n\nOur vital moment had come and passed. And Jetta had done her part; the\nrole of action upon this dim lurid stage was now mine to play.\n\nMy hands were free.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n_The Combat in the Green Darkness_\n\nAnother interval. A dead, dark silence. I did not dare move. Gutierrez\nwas here, within a few feet of me, probably. I wondered if he could\nsee the outlines of the black sack. Doubtless they were very vague.\nBut if I exposed my flesh, my face, my hands, that would at once\nattract his attention.\n\nI worked the loosened cords from my wrists; moved my stiffened hands\nuntil, with returning blood, the strength came to them. I could not\nreach my bound ankles without doubling up my knees. I did not dare\nchance such a movement of the sack. But, after a moment, I got my\nhands in front of me.\n\nThen I took the gag from my mouth and, with a cautious hand, pried at\nthe top of the sack where it was bunched over my head. Its fastening\nwas loose.\n\nAnother interval. A dim muffled voice; \"The Wasp is in sight,\nGutierrez!\"\n\nA movement--a sound like footsteps. Probably Gutierrez moving to the\ncorridor window to glance at Hanley's distant hovering flyer. I hoped\nit might be that: I had to take the chance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI slid the bag from my face. I feared an abrupt alarm, or Gutierrez\nleaping upon me. But there was silence, and I saw his vague dark\noutlines at the window oval, five feet from me.\n\nI got my ankles loose and slid the bag off. I was unsteady on my feet,\nbut desperation aided me.\n\nGutierrez half turned as I gripped him from behind. My hand on his\nmouth stifled his outcry. His black knife blade waved blindly. Then my\nclenched knuckle caught his temple, and dug with the twisting Santus\nblow. I was expert at it, and I found the vulnerable spot.\n\nHe crumpled in my grasp, and I slid his falling body across the narrow\ncorridor into the nearest cubby oval.\n\nAlmost soundless; and in the control room Jetta and De Boer were\nmurmuring and gazing at Hanley's ship, which hung ahead and above us\nat the zero-height.\n\nI had planned all my movements. No motion was lost. Gutierrez was\nabout my height and build. I stripped his black suit from him, donned\nit, then tied his ankles and wrists, and gagged him against the time\nwhen he would recover consciousness. Then I stuffed his body in the\nsack and tied its top.\n\nThis black suit had a mask, rolled up and fastened to the helmet. I\nloosed it, dropping it over my face. Knife in hand, I stood at the\ncorridor window.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was all black outside. The clouds were black overhead; the highest\nLowland crags, several thousand feet beneath us, were all but blotted\nout in the murky darkness. Only one thing was to be seen: a quarter of\na mile ahead, now, and a thousand feet higher than our level, the\nshining, bird-like outlines of Hanley's hovering little Wasp. It stood\nlike a painted image of an aero, alone on a dead-black background. Red\nand green signal-lights dotted it, and on its stern tip a small,\nspreading searchlight bathed the wings and the body with a revealing\nsilver radiance.\n\nOur forward flight had been checked, and we, too, were hovering. Hans\ndoubtless would remain for a time in the pilot cubby; De Boer and\nJetta were in the control room. It was only twenty feet away, but I\ncould barely see its oval entrance.\n\n\"Gutierrez!\"\n\nOne of them was calling. My hollow empty voice echoed back as I softly\nresponded:\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Be ready. We are arrived.\"\n\n\"Yes, Commander. All is well.\"\n\nI continued to stand at the window. Hanley's little balloon-car was\nvisible now. Then he cut it away. We had moved forward in the\ninterval. The tiny car floated out almost above us.\n\nMy gaze searched the void of darkness outside. Did Hanley have an\ninvisible flyer out there? Perhaps so. But it could accomplish nothing\nas yet. It would not even dare approach, for fear of collision with\nus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tiny car, with a white pilot light in it, swayed with a slow\ndescent. The basket beneath the supporting balloon oscillated in a\nwide swing, then steadied. A sudden flash showed up there--a flashing\nelectronic stream, from Hanley's Wasp to the basket. The shot swept\nthe basket interior. No one could be hidden there and survive.\n\nIt was Hanley's proof to us that he was following instructions.\n\n\"Hah! He obeys properly, Jetta!\"\n\nThe voice floated back to me from the control room. Could I creep in\nthere, surprise De Boer now, and kill him? Doubtless. But it would\nalarm Hans. I must await my chance to get them together.\n\n\"Gutierrez! Hans, get us under it! Gutierrez!\"\n\nThe vague outline of De Boer came toward me in the corridor, burly\ndark blob. His mask was down now. There were points of light, glowing\nlike faint distant stars, to mark his eyes.\n\n\"Gutierrez.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA small black figure followed after him. Jetta.\n\n\"Yes, De Boer.\" I stood over the sack. \"I am ready.\"\n\nDe Boer's giant shape towered beside me. Now! My knife thrust now! But\nHans was coming toward us. He would take alarm before I could reach\nhim.\n\n\"Open the side porte, Gutierrez. Hurry, the car is here. Hans, you\nshould have stayed up there!\"\n\n\"The drift is calculated; the car is just here.\"\n\nWe were all swift-moving shadows; disembodied voices.\n\n\"Get that porte open.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I opened it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe went outside on the runway. I passed close to Jetta, and just for\nan instant pressed my gloved fingers on the black fabric of her\narm--and she knew.\n\n\"Now, seize it.\"\n\n\"Here, Hans, climb up.\"\n\n\"I have it. Pull it, Gutierrez!\"\n\nThe car drifted at us from the black void. We caught it.\n\n\"Hold it, Gutierrez.\"\n\n\"Hans, clip the balloon. Up with you.\"\n\nIn the blurred haste, I could not get them together. I did not want to\nkill one and have the other leap upon me.\n\nWe fastened the little balloon and dragged the car onto the take-off\nplatform. The shape of Hans leaped into the car.\n\n\"It is here! The ransom money!\"\n\n\"Lift it to me. Heavy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Gutierrez, help me. Hurry! If Hanley tries any trickery--\"\n\nOur aero was drifting downward and southward in the slight wind.\nHanley's Wasp still hovered at the zero-height.\n\n\"In, Gutierrez.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHans and I hauled out the heavy casket and placed it on the wing\nrunway. De Boer pried up its lid. The gold was there. I could not tell\nwhere Jetta was; I prayed she would keep away from this.\n\nThen the shape of De Boer was missing! But in a moment he appeared,\ndragging the sack.\n\n\"Lift him, Gutierrez. Hans, unclip the balloon and shove off the car!\"\n\nWe were all standing at the two-foot rail of the runway. The\ncar-basket, floating now, was off side and level with us. My chance!\n\n\"In with him, Gutierrez.\"\n\nI shoved the body, encased in its black sack, with Hans helping me.\nAnd suddenly De Boer's knife came down at the sack! A stab. But an\ninstinct to save the poor wretch within swept me. I struck at De\nBoer's arm and deflected the blow. The sack tumbled into the car.\n\nI had neglected whatever chance had existed. Too late now!\n\n\"What in the hell!\"\n\nDe Boer's shape seized me.\n\n\"What--\"\n\nIt sent me into a sudden confusion. I flung him off. I stumbled\nagainst the shape of Hans.\n\nThe car was almost loose; drifting away.\n\nWithout thought--a frantic impulse--I pushed Hans over the brink. He\nfell into the car. It swayed into an oscillation with the impact. The\nballoon sank below our wing level and was gone, with only Hans,\nmuffled shouts floating up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd De Boer came leaping at me from behind. I whirled around. My\ndanger was too much for the watching Jetta. She screamed.\n\n\"Philip, look out for him!\"\n\n\"Hah! The American. By damn, what is this?\"\n\nIt gave De Boer pause. He gripped a wing stay-wire for a second.\n\nThen he came with a rush.\n\nThe corridor door was open behind me. I flung myself into it--and\ncollided with a shape.\n\n\"Philip!\"\n\nI shoved at her frantically.\n\n\"Jetta, get back! Away from us!\"\n\nI pulled at her, half falling. De Boer's shape came through the\ndoorway into the corridor. And was blotted out in the green darkness\nas he turned the other way, to avoid me if I struck.\n\nA silence. The shadow of Jetta was behind me. I stood with poised\nknife, listening, straining my eyes through the faint green darkness.\nDe Boer was here, knife in hand, fallen now into craftly, motionless\nsilence. He might have been close here down the corridor. Or in any\none of these nearby cubby doorways.\n\nI slid forward along the wall. The corridor was solid black down its\nlength: the green radiance seemed brighter at the control room behind\nme. Had De Boer gone into this solid blackness, to lure me?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stopped my advance. Stood again, trying to see or hear something.\n\nAnd then I saw him! Two small glowing points of light. Distant stars.\nHis eyes! Five feet ahead of me? Or ten? Or twenty?\n\nA rustle. A sound.\n\nHis dark form materialized as he came--a huge, black blob overwhelming\nme, his arm and knife blade striking.\n\nI dropped to the floor-grid, and his blade went over me. And as I\ndropped, I struck with an upward thrust. My knife met solidity; sank\ninto flesh.\n\nI twisted past him on the floor as he fell. My knife was gone: buried\nin him.\n\nWords were audible; choking gasps. I could see his form rising,\nstaggering. The open porte was near him; he swayed through it.\n\nDid he know he was mortally wounded? I think so. He swayed on the wing\nrunway, and I slid to the door and stood watching. And was aware of\nthe shadow of Jetta creeping to join me.\n\n\"Is he--?\"\n\n\"Quiet, Jetta.\"\n\nHe stood under the wing, swaying, gripping a stay. Then his voice\nsounded, and it seemed like a laugh.\n\n\"The craven American--wins.\" He moved a step. \"Not to see--me die--\"\n\nHe toppled at the rail. \"Good-by, Jetta.\"\n\nA great huddled shadow. A blob, toppling, falling....\n\nFar down there now the crags and peaks of the Lowland depths were\nvisible. The darkness swallowed his whirling body. We could not hear\nthe impact.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n_Episode of the Lowlands_\n\nThere is but little remaining for me to record. I could not operate\nthe mechanism of invisibility of De Boer's X-flyer. But its pilot\ncontrols were simple. With Jetta at my side, trembling now that our\ngruesome task was over, we groped our way through the green darkness\nand mounted to the pilot cubby. And within ten minutes I had lowered\nthe ship into the depths, found a landing place upon the dark rocks,\nand brought us down.\n\nHanley's Wasp had landed: we saw its lights half a mile from us. And\nthen the lights of another ship--an X-flyer convoying Hanley--slowly\nmaterializing nearby.\n\nAnd then reunion. Jetta and I left De Boer's invisible vessel and\nclambered over the rocks. And presently Hanley, staring at our\ngrotesque black forms, came rushing forward and greeted us.\n\nWe were an hour locating De Boer's flyer, for all that Jetta and I had\njust left it and thought we could find our way back. But we stumbled\nonto it at last. Hanley felt his way aboard and brought it to\nvisibility. It has since been returned to the Anti-War Department,\nwith the compliments of Hanley's Office.\n\nThe ransom money was restored to its proper source. Spawn's treasure\nof radiumized quicksilver we shipped back to Nareda, where it was\nchecked and divided, and Jetta's share legally awarded to her.\n\nDe Boer was dead when Hanley found him that night on the rocks. Jetta\nand I did not go to look at him....\n\nThe balloon basket landed safely. Hanley and his men were down there\nin time to seize it. Hans was caught; and Gutierrez, within the sack,\nwas found to be uninjured. They are incarcerated now in Nareda. They\nwere willing to tell the location of the bandit stronghold. A raid\nthere the following day resulted in the capture of most of De Boer's\nmen.\n\nAll this is now public news. You have heard it, of course. Yet in my\nnarrative, setting down the events as I lived them, I have tried to\ngive more vivid details than the bare facts as they were blared\nthrough the public audiphones.\n\nAn episode of the strange, romantic, fantastic Lowlands. A very\nunimportant series of incidents mingled with the news of a busy\nworld--just a few minutes of the newscasters' time to tell how a band\nof depth smugglers was caught.\n\nBut it was a very important episode to me. It changed, for me, a\nclanking, thrumming machine-made world into a shining fairyland of\ndreams come true. It gave me little Jetta.\n\n(_The End_)\n\n\n\n\nVagabonds of Space\n\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\n\n_By Harl Vincent_\n\n[Illustration: _Carr went mad with fury. There it was, looming close\nin his vision._]\n\n[Sidenote: From the depths of the Sargasso Sea of Space came the\nthought-warning, \"Turn back!\" But Carr and his Martian friend found it\nwas too late!]\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_The Nomad_\n\nGathered around a long table in a luxuriously furnished director's\nroom, a group of men listened in astonishment to the rapid and\nforceful speech of one of their number.\n\n\"I tell you I'm through, gentlemen,\" averred the speaker. \"I'm fed up\nwith the job, that's all. Since 2317 you've had me sitting at the helm\nof International Airways and I've worked my fool head off for you.\nNow--get someone else!\"\n\n\"Made plenty of money yourself, didn't you, Carr?\" asked one of the\ndirectors, a corpulent man with a self-satisfied countenance.\n\n\"Sure I did. That's not the point. I've done all the work. There's not\nanother executive in the outfit whose job is more than a title, and\nyou know it. I want a change and a rest. Going to take it, too. So, go\nahead with your election of officers and leave me out.\"\n\n\"Your stock?\" Courtney Davis, chairman of the board, sensed that Carr\nParker meant what he said.\n\n\"I'll hold it. The rest of you can vote it as you choose: divide the\nproxies pro rata, based on your individual holdings. But I reserve the\nright to dump it all on the market at the first sign of shady\ndealings. That suit you?\"\n\nThe recalcitrant young President of International Airways had risen\nfrom the table. The chairman attempted to restrain him.\n\n\"Come on now, Carr, let's reason this out. Perhaps if you just took a\nleave of absence--\"\n\n\"Call it anything you want. I'm done right now.\"\n\nCarr Parker stalked from the room, leaving eleven perspiring\ncapitalists to argue over his action.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rushed to the corridor and nervously pressed the call button of the\nelevators. A minute later he emerged upon the roof of the Airways\nbuilding, one of the tallest of New York's mid-town sky-scrapers. The\nair here, fifteen hundred feet above the hot street, was cool and\nfresh. He walked across the great flat surface of the landing stage to\ninspect a tiny helicopter which had just settled to a landing. Angered\nas he was, he still could not resist the attraction these trim little\ncraft had always held for him. The feeling was in his blood.\n\nHis interest, however, was short lived and he strolled to the\nobservation aisle along the edge of the landing stage. He stared\nmoodily into the heavens where thousands of aircraft of all\ndescriptions sped hither and yon. A huge liner of the Martian route\nwas dropping from the skies and drifting toward her cradle on Long\nIsland. He looked out over the city to the north: fifty miles of it he\nknew stretched along the east shore of the Hudson. Greatest of the\ncities of the world, it housed a fifth of the population of the United\nStates of North America; a third of the wealth.\n\nCities! The entire world lived in them! Civilization was too highly\ndeveloped nowadays. Adventure was a thing of the past. Of course there\nwere the other planets, Mars and Venus, but they were as bad. At least\nhe had found them so on his every business trip. He wished he had\nlived a couple of centuries ago, when the first space-ships ventured\nforth from the earth. Those were days of excitement and daring\nenterprise. Then a man could find ways of getting away from\nthings--next to nature--out into the forests; hunting; fishing. But\nthe forests were gone, the streams enslaved by the power monopolies.\nThere were only the cities--and barren plains. Everything in life was\nmade by man, artificial.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething drew his eyes upward and he spotted an unusual object in the\nheavens, a mere speck as yet but drawing swiftly in from the upper air\nlanes. But this ship, small though it appeared, stood out from amongst\nits fellows for some reason. Carr rubbed his eyes to clear his vision.\nWas it? Yes--it was--surrounded by a luminous haze. Notwithstanding\nthe brilliance of the afternoon sun, this haze was clearly visible. A\nsilver shimmering that was not like anything he had seen on Earth. The\nship swung in toward the city and was losing altitude rapidly. Its\nsilvery aura deserted it and the vessel was revealed as a sleek,\ntapered cylinder with no wings, rudders or helicopter screws. Like the\ngiant liners of the Interplanetary Service it displayed no visible\nmeans of support or propulsion. This was no ordinary vessel.\n\nCarr watched in extreme interest as it circled the city in a huge\nspiral, settling lower at each turn. It seemed that the pilot was\nsearching for a definite landing stage. Then suddenly it swooped with\na rush. Straight for the stage of the Airways building! The strange\naura reappeared and the little vessel halted in mid-air, poised a\nmoment, then dropped gracefully and lightly as a feather to the level\nsurface not a hundred feet from where he stood. He hurried to the spot\nto examine the strange craft.\n\n\"Mado!\" he exclaimed in surprise as a husky, bronzed Martian squeezed\nthrough the quickly opened manhole and clambered heavily to the\nplatform. Mado of Canax--an old friend!\n\n\"Devils of Terra!\" gasped the Martian, his knees giving way, \"--your\nmurderous gravity! Here, help me. I've forgotten the energizing\nswitch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr laughed as he fumbled with a mechanism that was strapped to the\nMartian's back. Mado, who tipped the scales at over two hundred pounds\non his own planet, weighed nearly six hundred here. His legs simply\ncouldn't carry the load!\n\n\"There you are, old man.\" Parker had located the switch and a musical\npurr came from the black box between the Martian's broad shoulders.\n\"Now stand up and tell me what you're doing here. And what's the idea\nof the private ship? Come all the way from home in it?\"\n\nHis friend struggled to his feet with an effort, for the field\nemanating from the black box required a few seconds to reach the\nintensity necessary to counteract two-thirds of the earth's gravity.\n\n\"Thanks Carr,\" he grinned. \"Yes, I came all the way in that bus.\nAlone, too--and she's mine! What do you think of her?\"\n\n\"A peach, from what I can see. But how come? Not using a private\nspace-flier on your business trips, are you?\"\n\n\"Not on your life! I've retired. Going to play around for a few years.\nThat's why I bought the Nomad.\"\n\n\"Retired! Why Mado, I just did the same thing.\"\n\n\"Great stuff! They've worked you to death. What are you figuring on\ndoing with yourself?\"\n\nCarr shrugged his shoulders resignedly. \"Usual thing, I suppose.\nTravel aimlessly, and bore myself into old age. Nothing else to do. No\nkick out of life these days at all, Mado, even in chasing around from\nplanet to planet. They're all the same.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martian looked keenly at his friend. \"Oh, is that so?\" he said.\n\"No kick, eh? Well, let me tell you, Carr Parker, you come with me and\nwe'll find something you'll get a kick out of. Ever seen the Sargasso\nSea of the solar system? Ever been on one of the asteroids? Ever seen\nthe other side of the Moon--Uranus--Neptune--Planet 9, the farthest\nout from the sun?\"\n\n\"No-o.\" Carr's eyes brightened somewhat.\n\n\"Then you haven't seen anything or been anywhere. Trouble with you is\nyou've been in the rut too long. Thinking there's nothing left in the\nuniverse but the commonplace. Right, too, if you stick to the regular\nroutes of travel. But the _Nomad's_ different. I'm just a rover when\nI'm at her controls, a vagabond in space--free as the ether that\nsurrounds her air-tight hull. And, take it from me, there's something\nto see and do out there in space. Off the usual lanes, perhaps, but\nit's there.\"\n\n\"You've been out--how long?\" Carr hesitated.\n\n\"Eighty Martian days. Seen plenty too.\" He waved his arm in a gesture\nthat seemed to take in the entire universe.\n\n\"Why come here, with so much to be seen out there?\"\n\n\"Came to visit you, old stick-in-the-mud,\" grinned Mado, \"and to try\nand persuade you to join me. I find you footloose already. You're\nitching for adventure; excitement. Will you come?\"\n\nCarr listened spellbound. \"Right now?\" he asked.\n\n\"This very minute. Come on.\"\n\n\"My bag,\" objected Carr, \"it must be packed. I'll need funds too.\"\n\n\"Bag! What for? Plenty of duds on the _Nomad_--for any old climate.\nAnd money--don't make me laugh! Vagabonds need money?\" He backed\ntoward the open manhole of the _Nomad_, still grinning.\n\nCarr hesitated, resisting the impulse to take Mado at his word. He\nlooked around. The landing stage had been deserted, but people now\nwere approaching. People not to be tolerated at the moment. He saw\nCourtney Davis, grim and determined. There'd be more arguments,\nuseless but aggravating. Well, why not go? He'd decided to break away.\nWhat better chance? Suddenly he dived for the manhole of Mado's\nvessel; wriggled his way to the padded interior of the air-lock. He\nheard the clang of the circular cover. Mado was clamping it to its\ngasketed seat.\n\n\"Let's go!\" he shouted.\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Into the Heavens_\n\nThe directors of International Airways stared foolishly when they saw\nCarr Parker and the giant Martian enter the mysterious ship which was\na trespasser on their landing stage. They gazed incredulously as the\ngleaming torpedo-shaped vessel arose majestically from its position.\nThere was no evidence of motive power other than a sudden radiation\nfrom its hull plates of faintly crackling streamers of silvery light.\nThey fell back in alarm as it pointed its nose skyward and accelerated\nwith incredible rapidity, the silver energy bathing them in its\nblinding luminescence. They burst forth in excited recrimination when\nit vanished into the blue. Courtney Davis shook his fist after the\ndeparting vessel and swore mightily.\n\nCarr Parker forgot them entirely when he clambered into the bucket\nseat beside Mado, who sat at the Nomad's controls. He was free at\nlast: free to probe the mysteries of outer space, to roam the skies\nwith this Martian he had admired since boyhood.\n\n\"Glad you came?\" Mado asked his Terrestrial friend.\n\n\"You bet. But tell me about yourself. How you've been and how come\nyou've rebelled, too? I haven't seen you for a long time, you know.\nWhy, it's been years!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right. Guess I got fed up with things about the same way\nyou did. Knew last time I saw you that you were feeling as I did.\nThat's why I came after you.\"\n\n\"But this vessel, the _Nomad_. I didn't know such a thing was in\nexistence. How does it operate? It seems quite different from the\nusual ether-liners.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's a mystery ship. Invented and built by Thrygis, a discredited\nscientist of my country. Spent a fortune on it and then went broke and\nkilled himself. I bought it from the executors for a song. They\nthought it was a pile of junk. But the plans and notes of the inventor\nwere there and I studied 'em well. The ship is a marvel, Carr.\nUtilizes gravitational attraction and reversal as a propelling force\nand can go like the Old Boy himself. I've hit two thousand miles a\nsecond with her.\"\n\n\"A second! Why, that's ten times as fast as the regular liners! Must\nuse a whale of a lot of fuel. And where do you keep it? The fuel, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Make it right on board. I'm telling you Carr, the _Nomad_ has no\nequal. She's a corker.\"\n\n\"I'll say she is. But what do you mean--make the fuel?\"\n\n\"Cosmic rays. Everywhere in space you know. Seems they are the result\nof violent concentrations of energy that cause the birth of atoms.\nThrygis doped out a collector of these rays that takes 'em from their\npaths and concentrates 'em in a retort where there's a spongy metal\ncatalyst that never deteriorates. Here there is a reaction to the\noriginal action out in space and new atoms are born, simple ones of\nhydrogen. But what could be sweeter for use in one of our regular\natomic motors? The energy of disintegration is used to drive the\ngenerators of the artificial gravity field, and there you are. Sounds\ncomplicated, but really isn't. And nothing to get out of whack\neither.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Beats the rocket motors and bulky fuel of the regular liners a mile,\ndoesn't it? But since when are you a navigator, Mado?\"\n\n\"Don't need to be a navigator with the _Nomad_. She's automatic, once\nthe controls are set. Say we wish to visit Venus. The telescope is\nsighted on that body and the gravity forces adjusted so we'll be\nattracted in that direction and repelled in the opposite direction.\nThen we can go to bed and forget it. The movement of the body in its\norbit makes no difference because the force follows wherever it goes.\nSee? The speed increases until the opposing forces are equal, when\ndeceleration commences and we gradually slow down until within ten\nthousand miles of the body, when the _Nomad_ automatically stops.\nDoesn't move either, until we awaken to take the controls. How's that\nfor simple?\"\n\n\"Good enough. But suppose a wandering meteor or a tiny asteroid gets\nin the way? At our speed it wouldn't have to be as big as your fist to\ngo through us like a shot.\"\n\n\"All taken care of, my dear Carr. I told you Thrygis was a wiz. Such a\nhappenstance would disturb the delicate balance of the energy\ncompensators and the course of the _Nomad_ would instantly alter to\ndodge the foreign object. Once passed by, the course would again be\nresumed.\"\n\n\"Some ship, the _Nomad_!\" Carr was delighted with the explanations.\n\"I'm sold on her and on the trip. Where are we now and where bound?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado glanced at the instrument board. \"Nearly a million miles out and\nheaded for that Sargasso Sea I told you about,\" he said. \"It isn't\nvisible in the telescope, but I've got it marked by the stars. Out\nbetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, a quarter of a billion miles\naway. But we'll average better than a thousand miles a second. Be\nthere in three days of your time.\"\n\n\"How can there be a sea out there in space?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's just my name for it. Most peculiar thing, though. There's\na vast, billowy sort of a cloud. Twists and weaves around as if alive.\nLooks like seaweed or something; and Carr, I swear there are things\nfloating around in it. Wrecks. Something damn peculiar, anyway. I vow\nI saw a signal. People marooned there or something. Sorta scared me\nand I didn't stay around for long as there was an awful pull from the\nmass. Had to use full reversal of the gravity force to get away.\"\n\n\"Now why didn't you tell me that before? That's something to think\nabout. Like the ancient days of ocean-going ships on Earth.\"\n\n\"Tell you? How could I tell you? You've been questioning me ever since\nI first saw you and I've been busy every minute answering you.\"\n\nCarr laughed and slid from his seat to the floor. He felt curiously\nlight and loose-jointed. A single step carried him to one of the\nstanchions of the control cabin and he clung to it for a moment to\nregain his equilibrium.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" he demanded. \"No internal gravity mechanism on the\n_Nomad_?\"\n\n\"Sure is. But it's adjusted for Martian gravity. You'll get along, but\nit wouldn't be so easy for me with Earth gravity. I'd have to wear the\nportable G-ray all the time, and that's not so comfortable. All right\nwith you?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly. I didn't understand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr saw that his friend had unstrapped the black box from his\nshoulders. He didn't blame him. Glad he wasn't a Martian. It was\nmighty inconvenient for them on Venus or Terra. Their bodies, large\nand of double the specific gravity, were not easily handled where\ngravity was nearly three times their own. The Venusians and\nTerrestrials were more fortunate when on Mars, for they could become\naccustomed to the altered conditions. Only had to be careful they\ndidn't overdo. He remembered vividly a quick move he had made on his\nfirst visit to Mars. Carried him twenty feet to slam against a granite\npedestal. Bad cut that gave him, and the exertion in the rarefied\natmosphere had him gasping painfully.\n\nHe walked to one of the ports and peered through its thick window.\nMado was fussing with the controls. The velvety blackness of the\nheavens; the myriad diamond points of clear brilliance. Cold, too, it\nlooked out there, and awesomely vast. The sun and Earth had been left\nbehind and could not be seen. But Carr didn't care. The heavens were\nmarvelous when viewed without the obstruction of an atmosphere. But\nhe'd seen them often enough on his many business trips to Mars and\nVenus.\n\n\"Ready for bed?\" Mado startled him with a tap on the shoulder.\n\n\"Why--if you say so. But you haven't shown me through the _Nomad_\nyet.\"\n\n\"All the time in the universe for that. Man, don't you realize you're\nfree? Come, let's grab some sleep. Need it out here. The ship'll be\nhere when we wake up. She's flying herself right now. Fast, too.\"\n\nCarr looked at the velocity indicator. Seven hundred miles a second\nand still accelerating! He felt suddenly tired and when Mado opened\nthe door of a sleeping cabin its spotless bunk looked very inviting.\nHe turned in without protest.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_A Message_\n\nThe days passed quickly, whether measured by the Martian chronometer\naboard the _Nomad_ or by Carr's watch, which he was regulating to\nmatch the slightly longer day of the red planet. He was becoming\nproficient in the operation of all mechanisms of the ship and had\ndeveloped a fondness for its every appointment.\n\nBehind them the sun was losing much of its blinding magnificence as it\nreceded into the ebon background of the firmament. The Earth was but\none of the countless worlds visible through the stern ports,\ndistinguishable by its slightly greenish tinge. They had reached the\nvicinity of the phenomenon of space Mado had previously discovered.\nCarr found himself seething with excitement as the _Nomad_ was brought\nto a drifting speed.\n\nMado, who had disclaimed all knowledge of navigation, was busy in the\nturret with a sextant. He made rapid calculations based on its\nindications and hurried to the controls.\n\n\"Find it?\" Carr asked.\n\n\"Yep. Be there in a half hour.\"\n\nThe nose of the vessel swung around and Mado adjusted the gravity\nenergy carefully. Carr glued his eye to the telescope.\n\n\"See anything?\" inquired Mado.\n\n\"About a million stars, that's all.\"\n\n\"Funny. Should be close by.\"\n\nThen: \"Yes! Yes! I see it!\" Carr exulted. \"A milky cloud. Transparent\nalmost. To the right a little more!\"\n\nThe mysterious cloud rushed to meet them and soon was visible to the\nnaked eye through the forward port. Their speed increased alarmingly\nand Mado cut off the energy.\n\n\"What's that?\" Mado stared white-faced at his friend.\n\n\"A voice! You hear it too?\"\n\n\"Yes. Listen!\"\n\nAmazed, they gazed at each other. It was a voice; yet not a sound came\nto their ears. The voice was in their own consciousness. A mental\nmessage! Yet each heard and understood. There were no words, but clear\nmental images.\n\n\"Beware!\" it seemed to warn. \"Come not closer, travelers from afar.\nThere is danger in the milky fleece before you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado pulled frantically at the energy reverse control. The force was\nnow fully repelling. Still the billowing whiteness drew nearer. It\nboiled and bubbled with the ferocity of one of the hot lava cauldrons\nof Mercury. Changing shape rapidly, it threw out long streamers that\nwrithed and twisted like the arms of an octopus. Reaching. Searching\nfor victims!\n\n\"God!\" whispered Carr. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Take warning,\" continued the voice that was not a voice. \"A great\nship, a royal ship from a world unknown to you, now is caught in the\ngrip of this mighty monster. We can not escape, and death draws\nquickly near. But we can warn others and ask that our fate be reported\nto our home body.\"\n\nA sudden upheaval of the monstrous mass spewed forth an object that\nbounced a moment on the rippling surface and then was lost to view. A\nsphere, glinting golden against the white of its awful captor.\n\n\"The space-ship!\" gasped Mado. \"It's vanished again!\"\n\nThey hurtled madly in the direction of this monster of the heavens,\ntheir reverse energy useless.\n\n\"We're lost, Mado.\" Carr was calm now. This was excitement with a\nvengeance. He'd wished for it and here it was. But he'd much rather\nhave a chance to fight for his life. Fine ending to his dreams!\n\n\"Imps of the canals! The thing's alive!\" Mado hurled himself at the\ncontrols as a huge blob of the horrible whiteness broke loose from the\nmain body and wobbled uncertainly toward them. A long feeler reached\nforth and grasped the errant portion, returning it with a vicious\njerk.\n\n\"Turn back! Turn back!\" came the eery warning from the golden sphere.\n\"All is over for us. Our hull is crushed. The air is pouring from our\nlast compartment. Already we find breathing difficult. Turn back! The\nthird satellite of the fifth planet is our home. Visit it, we beseech\nyou, and report the manner of our going. This vile creature of space\nhas power to draw you to its breast, to crush you as we are crushed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Nomad_ lurched and shuddered, drawn ever closer to the horrid\nmass of the thing. A gigantic jellyfish, that's what it was, a hundred\nmiles across! Carr shivered in disgust as it throbbed anew, sending\nout those grasping streamers of its mysterious material. As the\n_Nomad_ plunged to its doom with increasing speed, Mado tried to\nlocate some spot in the universe where an extreme effect could be\nobtained from the full force of the attracting or repulsive energies.\nThey darted this way and that but always found themselves closer to\nthe milky billows that now were pulsating in seeming eagerness to\nengulf the new victim.\n\nOnce more came the telepathic warning, \"Delay no longer. It is high\ntime you turned back. You must escape to warn our people and yours.\nEven now the awful creature has us in its vitals, its tentacles\nreaching through our shattered walls, creeping and twining through the\npassages of our vessel. Crushing floors and walls, its demoniac\nenergies heating our compartment beyond belief. We can hold out no\nlonger. Go! Go quickly. Remember--the third satellite of the fifth\nplanet--to the city of golden domes. Tell of our fate. Our people will\nunderstand. You--\"\n\nThe voice was stilled. Mado groaned as if in pain and Carr saw in that\ninstant that each knob and lever on the control panel glowed with an\nunearthly brush discharge. Not violet as of high frequency\nelectricity, but red. Cherry red as of heated metal. The emanations of\nthe cosmic monster were at work on the _Nomad_. A glance through the\nforward port showed they had but a few miles to go. They'd be in the\nclutches of the horror in minutes, seconds, at the rate they were\ntraveling. Mado slumped in his seat, his proud head rolling\ngrotesquely on his breast. He slid to the floor, helpless.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr went mad with fury. It couldn't be! This thing of doom was a\ncreature of his imagination! But no--there it was, looming close in\nhis vision. By God, he'd leave the mark of the _Nomad_ on the vicious\nthing! He remembered the ray with which the vessel was armed. He was\nin the pilot's seat, fingering controls that blistered his hands and\ncramped his arms with an unnameable force. He'd fight the brute! Full\nenergy--head on--that was the way to meet it. Why bother with the\nreversal? It was no use.\n\nA blood-red veil obscured his vision. He felt for the release of the\nray; pulled the gravity energy control to full power forward. In a\ndaze, groping blindly for support, he waited for the shock of impact.\nThe mass of that monstrosity must be terrific, else why had it such a\npower of attraction for other bodies? Or was it that the thing\nradiated energies unknown to science? Whatever it was, the thing would\nknow the sting of the _Nomad's_ ray. Whatever its nature, animate or\ninanimate, it was matter. The ray destroyed matter. Obliterated it\nutterly. Tore the atoms asunder, whirling their electrons from their\norbits with terrific velocity. There'd be some effect, that was\ncertain! No great use perhaps. But a crater would mark the last\nresting place of the _Nomad_; a huge crater. Perhaps the misty\nwhiteness would close in over them later. But there'd be less of the\ncreature's bulk to menace other travelers in space.\n\nHis head ached miserably; his body was shot through and through with\ncramping agonies. The very blood in his veins was liquid fire, searing\nhis veins and arteries with pulsing awfulness. He staggered from the\ncontrol cabin; threw himself on his bunk. The covers were electrified\nand clung to him like tissue to rubbed amber. The wall of the sleeping\ncabin vibrated with a screeching note. The floors trembled. Madness!\nThat's all it was! He'd awaken in a moment. Find himself in his own\nbed at home. He'd dreamed of adventures before now. But never of such\nas this! It just couldn't happen! A nightmare--fantasy of an\nover-tired brain--it was.\n\nThere came a violent wrench that must have torn the hull plates from\ntheir bracings. The ship seemed to close in on him and crush him. A\nterrific concussion flattened him to the bunk. Then all was still.\nCarr Parker's thoughts broke short abruptly. He had slipped into\nunconsciousness.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Europa_\n\nWhen Carr opened his eyes it was to the normal lighting of his own\nsleeping cabin. The _Nomad_ was intact, though an odor of scorched\nvarnish permeated the air. They were unharmed--as yet. He turned on\nhis side and saw that Mado was moving about at the side of his couch.\nGood old Mado! With a basin of water in his hand and a cloth. He'd\nbeen bathing his face. Brought him to. He sat up just as Mado turned\nto apply the cloth anew.\n\n\"Good boy, Carr! All right?\" smiled the Martian.\n\n\"Little dizzy. But I'm okay.\" Carr sprang to his feet where he wabbled\nuncertainly for a moment. \"But the _Nomad?_\" he asked. \"Is she--are we\nsafe?\"\n\n\"Never safer. What in the name of Saturn did you do?\"\n\nCarr passed his hand across his eyes, trying to remember. \"The D-ray,\"\nhe said. \"I turned it on and dived into the thing with full\nattraction. Then--I forget. Where is it--the thing, I mean?\"\n\n\"Look!\" Mado drew him to the stern compartment.\n\nFar behind them there shone a misty wreath, a ring of drifting matter\nthat writhed and twisted as if in mortal agony.\n\n\"Is that it?\"\n\n\"What's left of it. You shot your way through it; through and out of\nits influence. D-ray must have devitalized the thing as it bored\nthrough. Killed its energies--for the time, at least.\"\n\nAlready, the thing was closing in. Soon there would be a solid mass as\nbefore. But the _Nomad_ was saved.\n\n\"How about yourself?\" asked Carr anxiously. \"Last time I saw you you\nwere flat on the floor.\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong with me now. A bit stiff and sore, that's all. When I\ncame to I put all the controls in neutral and came looking for you. I\nwas scared, but the thing's all over now, so let's go.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Europa.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"Don't you remember? The third satellite of the fifth planet. That's\nEuropa, third in distance from Jupiter, the fifth planet. It is about\nthe size of Terra's satellite--your Moon. We'll find the city of the\ngolden domes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr's eyes renewed their sparkle. \"Right!\" he exclaimed. \"I forgot\nthe mental message. Poor devils! All over for them now. But we'll\ncarry their message. How far is it?\"\n\n\"Don't know yet till I determine our position and the position of\nJupiter. But it's quite a way. Jupiter's 483 million miles from the\nSun, you know.\"\n\n\"We're more than half way, then.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. Perhaps we're on the opposite side of the sun from\nJupiter's present position. Then we'd have a real trip.\"\n\n\"Let's figure it out.\" Carr was anxious to be off.\n\nLuck was with them, as they found after some observations from the\nturret. Jupiter lay off their original course by not more than fifteen\ndegrees. It was but four days' journey.\n\nAgain they were on their way and the two men, Martian and Terrestrial,\nmade good use of the time in renewing their old friendship and in the\nstudy of astronomy as they had done during the first leg of their\njourney. Though of widely differing build and nature, the two found a\nclose bond in their similar inclinations. The library of the Nomad was\nan excellent one. Thrygis had seen to that, all of the voice-vision\nreels being recorded in Cos, the interplanetary language, with its\nstandardized units of weight and measurement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe supplies on board the _Nomad_ were ample. Synthetic foods there\nwere for at least a hundred Martian days. The supply of oxygen and\nwater was inexhaustible, these essential items being produced in\nautomatic retorts where disassembled electrons from their cosmic-ray\nhydrogen were reassembled in the proper structure to produce atoms of\nany desired element. Their supply of synthetic food could be\nreplenished in like manner when necessity arose. Thrygis had forgotten\nnothing.\n\n\"How do you suppose we'll make ourselves understood to the people of\nEuropa?\" asked Carr, when they had swung around the great orb of\nJupiter and were headed toward the satellite.\n\n\"Shouldn't have any trouble, Carr. Believe me, to a people who have\nprogressed to the point of sending mental messages over five hundred\nmiles of space, it'll be a cinch, understanding our simple mental\nprocesses. Bet they'll read our every thought.\"\n\n\"That's right. But the language. Proper names and all that. Can't get\nthose over with thought waves.\"\n\n\"No, but I'll bet they'll have some way of solving that too. You wait\nand see.\"\n\nCarr lighted a cigar and inhaled deeply as he gazed from one of the\nports. He'd never felt better in his life. Always had liked Martian\ntobacco, too. Wondered what they'd do when the supply ran out. One\nthing they couldn't produce synthetically. The disc of the satellite\nloomed near and it shone with a warmly inviting light. Almost red,\nlike the color of Mars, it was. Sort of golden, rather. Anyway, he\nwondered what awaited them there. This was a great life, this roaming\nin space, unhampered by laws or conventions. The _Nomad_ was well\nnamed.\n\n\"Wonder what they'll think of our yarn,\" he said.\n\n\"And me. I wonder, too, what that ungodly thing was back there. The\nthing that is now the grave of some of their people. And what the\ngolden sphere was doing so far from home. It's a mystery.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had gone over the same ground a hundred times and had not reached\na satisfactory conclusion. But perhaps they'd learn more in the city\nof golden domes.\n\n\"Another thing,\" said Carr, \"that's puzzled me. Why is it that Europa\nhas not been discovered before this; that it's inhabited, I mean?\"\n\n\"Rocket ships couldn't carry enough fuel. Besides, our astronomers've\nalways told us that the outer planets were too cold; too far from the\nsun.\"\n\n\"That is something to think about. Maybe we'll not be able to stand\nthe low temperature; thin atmosphere; low surface gravity.\"\n\n\"We've our insulated suits and the oxygen helmets for the first two\nobjections. The G-rays'll hold us down in any gravity. But we'll see\nmighty soon. We're here.\"\n\nThey had entered the atmosphere as they talked and the _Nomad_ was\napproaching the surface in a long glide with repulsion full on. It was\ndaytime on the side they neared. Pale daylight, but revealing. The\ngreat ball that was Jupiter hung low on the horizon, its misty outline\nfaintly visible against the deep green of the sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe surface over which they skimmed was patchworked with farm-lands\nand crisscrossed by gleaming ribbons. Roadways! It was like the\nvoice-vision records of the ancient days on Mars and Terra before\ntheir peoples had taken to the air. Here was a body where a person\ncould get out in the open; next to nature. They crossed a lake of calm\ngreen water fringed by golden sands. At its far side a village spread\nout beneath them and was gone; a village of broad pavements and\ncircular dwellings with flat rooms, each with its square of ground. A\ngolden, mountain range loomed in the background; vanished beneath\nthem. More fields and roads. Everywhere there were yellows and reds\nand the silver sheen of the roads. No green save that of the darkening\nsky and the waters of the streams and ponds. It was a most inviting\npanorama.\n\nOccasionally they passed a vessel of the air--strange flapping-winged\ncraft that soared and darted like huge birds. Once one of them\napproached so closely they could see its occupants, seemingly a people\nsimilar to the Venusians, small of stature and slender.\n\n\"How in time are we to find this city of golden domes?\" Carr\nejaculated.\n\nAs if in answer to his question there came a startling command,\nanother of the mental messages.\n\n\"Halt!\" it conveyed to their mind. \"Continue not into our country\nuntil we have communed with you.\"\n\nObediently Mado brought up the nose of the _Nomad_ and slowed her down\nto a gradual stop. They hovered at an altitude of about four thousand\nfeet, both straining their ears as if listening for actual speech.\n\n\"It is well,\" continued the message. \"Your thoughts are good. You come\nfrom afar seeking the city of golden domes. Proceed now and a fleet of\nour vessels will meet you and guide you to our city.\"\n\n\"Now wouldn't that jar you?\" whispered Carr. \"Just try to get away\nwith anything on this world.\"\n\nMado laughed as he started the generators of the propelling\nenergy. \"I'd hate to have a wife of Europa,\" he commented. \"No\nsitting-up-with-sick-friend story could get by with her!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The City of Golden Domes_\n\nWith the _Nomad_ cruising slowly over the surface of the peaceful\nsatellite, Mado sampled the atmosphere through a tube which was\nprovided for that purpose. The pressure was low, as they had expected;\nabout twenty inches of mercury in the altitude at which they drifted.\nBut the oxygen content was fairly high and the impurities negligible.\nA strange element was somewhat in evidence, though Mado's analysis\nshowed this to be present in but minute quantity. They opened the\nports and drew their first breath of the atmosphere of Europa.\n\n\"Good air, Carr.\" Mado was sniffing at one of the ports. \"A bit rare\nfor you, but I think you'll get along with it. Temperature of\nforty-five degrees. That's not so bad. The strangest thing is the\ngravity. This body isn't much more than two thousand miles in\ndiameter, yet its gravity is about the same as on Venus--seven eighths\nof that of Terra. Must have a huge nickel-iron core.\"\n\n\"Yes. It'll be a cinch for me. But you, you big lummox--it's the G-ray\nfor you as long as we're here.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. You get all the breaks, don't you?\"\n\nCarr laughed. He was becoming anxious to land. \"What sort of a\nreception do you suppose we'll get?\" he said.\n\n\"Not bad, from the tone of that last message. And here they come,\nCarr. Look--a dozen of them. A royal reception, so far.\"\n\nSuddenly they were in the midst of a flock of great birds; birds that\nflapped their golden wings to rise, then soared and circled like the\ngulls of the terrestrial oceans. And these mechanical birds were fast.\nCarr and Mado watched in fascination as they strung out in V formation\nand led the way in the direction of the setting sun. Six, seven\nhundred miles an hour the _Nomad's_ indicator showed, as they swung in\nbehind these ships of Europa.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey crossed a large body of water, a lake of fully five hundred miles\nin width. More country then, hardly populated now and with but few of\nthe gleaming roadways. The sun had set, but there was scarcely any\ndiminution of the light for the great ball that was Jupiter reflected\na brilliance of far greater intensity than that of the full Moon on a\nclear Terrestrial night. A marvelous sight the gigantic body\npresented, with its alternate belts of gray-blue and red and dazzling\nwhite. And it hung so low and huge in the heavens that it seemed one\nhad but to stretch forth a hand to touch its bright surface.\n\nAnother mountain range loomed close and was gone. On its far side\nthere stretched the desolate wastes of a desert, a barren plain that\nextended in all directions to the horizon. Wind-swept, it was and\nmenacing beneath them. Europa was not all as they had first seen it.\n\nA glimmer of brightness appeared at the horizon. The fleet was\nreducing speed and soon they saw that their journey was nearly over.\nAt the far edge of the desert the bright spot resolved itself into the\noutlines of a city, the city of golden domes. Cones they looked like,\nrather, with rounded tops and fluted walls. The mental message had\nconveyed the most fitting description possible without words or\npicture.\n\nThe landing was over so quickly that they had but confused impressions\nof their reception. A great square in the heart of the city, crowded\nwith people. Swooping maneuvers of hundreds of the bird-like ships. An\nopen space for their arrival. The platform where a committee awaited\nthem. The king, or at least he seemed to be king. The sea of upturned\nfaces, staring eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado fidgeted and opened his mouth to voice a protest but Carr nudged\nhim into silence. The king had risen from his seat in the circle on\nthe platform and was about to address them. There was no repetition of\nthe telepathic means of communication.\n\n\"Welcome, travelers from the inner planets,\" said the king. He spoke\nCos perfectly! \"Cardos, emperor of the body you call Europa, salutes\nyou. Our scientists have recorded your thoughts with their psycho-ray\napparatus and have learned that you have a message for us, a message\nwe fear is not pleasant. Am I correct?\"\n\nCarr stared at the soft-voiced monarch of this remarkable land. It was\nincredible that he spoke in the universal language of the inner\nplanets!\n\n\"Your Highness,\" he replied, \"is correct. We have a message. But it\namazes us that you are familiar with our language.\"\n\n\"That we shall explain later. Meanwhile--the message!\"\n\n\"The message,\" Carr said, \"is not pleasant. A golden sphere out in\nspace. Helpless in the clutches of a nameless monster, a vast creature\nof jellylike substance but possessed of enormous destructive energy. A\nmental message to our vessel warning us away and bidding us to come\nhere; to tell you of their fate. We escaped and here we are.\"\n\nThe face of Cardos paled. He reached for an egg-shaped crystal that\nreposed on the table; spoke rapidly into its shimmering depths. Hidden\namplifiers carried his voice throughout the square in booming tones.\nIt was a strange tongue he spoke, with many gutturals and sibilants. A\ngroan came up from the assembled multitude.\n\nCardos tossed the crystal to the table with a resigned gesture, then\ntottered and swayed. Instant confusion reigned in the square and the\nemperor was assisted from the platform by two of his retainers. They\nnever saw him again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the counsellors, a middle-aged man with graying russet hair and\nlarge gray eyes set in a perfectly smooth countenance, stepped from\nthe platform and grasped the two adventurers as the confusion in the\nsquare increased to an uproar.\n\n\"Come,\" he whispered, in excellent Cos; \"I'll explain all to you in\nthe quiet of my own apartments. I am Detis, a scientist, and my home\nis close by.\"\n\nGently he clung to them as the larger men forced their way between the\nmilling groups of excited Europans. No one gave them much attention.\nAll seemed to be overcome with grief. A terrible disaster, this loss\nof the golden sphere must be!\n\nThey were out of the square and in one of the broad streets. The\nfluted sides of the unpointed cones shone softly golden on all sides.\nAlike in every respect were these dwellings of the people of Europa,\nand strangely attractive in the light of the mother planet.\n\nNot a word was spoken when they reached the abode of their guide. They\nentered an elaborate hall and were whisked upward in an automatic\nelevator. Detis ushered them into his apartment when they alighted. He\nsmiled gravely at their looks of wonder as they cast eyes on the maze\nof apparatus before them. It was a laboratory rather than a living\nroom in which they stood.\n\nDetis led them to an adjoining room where he bid them be seated. They\nexchanged wondering glances as their host paced the floor vigorously\nbefore speaking further.\n\n\"Friends,\" he finally blurted, \"I hope you'll excuse my emotion but\nthe news you brought is a terrible blow to me as to all Europa. Carli,\nour prince, beloved son of Cardos, was commander of the ship you\nreported lost. We deeply mourn his loss.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr and Mado waited in respectful silence while their host made\neffort to control his feelings.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, after a moment, \"I can talk. You have many questions\nto ask, I know. So have I. But first I must tell you that Carli's was\nan expedition to your own worlds. A grave danger hangs over them and\nhe was sent to warn them. He has been lost. Our only space-ship\ncapable of making the journey also is lost. Six Martian years were\nrequired to build it, so I fear the warning will never reach your\npeople. Already the time draws near.\"\n\n\"A grave danger?\" asked Mado. \"What sort of a danger?\"\n\n\"War! Utter destruction! Conquest by the most warlike and ambitious\npeople in the solar system.\"\n\n\"Not the people of Europa?\" asked Carr.\n\n\"Indeed not. There is another inhabited satellite of Jupiter, next\nfarthest from the mother planet. Ganymede, you call it. It is from\nthere that these conquerors are to set forth.\"\n\n\"Many of them?\" inquired Mado.\n\n\"Two million or so. They're prepared to send an army of more than a\ntenth of that number on the first expedition.\"\n\n\"A mere handful!\" Carr was contemptuous.\n\n\"True, but they are armed with the most terrible of weapons. Your\npeople are utterly unprepared and, unless warned, will be driven from\ntheir cities and left in the deserts to perish of hunger and exposure.\nThis is a real danger.\"\n\n\"Something in it, Carr, if what he says is true. We've no arms nor\nwarriors. Haven't had for two centuries. You know it as well as I do.\"\n\n\"Bah! Overnight we could have a million armed and ready to fight them\noff.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDetis raised his hand. \"You offend me,\" he said gravely. \"I have told\nyou this in good faith and you reward me with disbelief and boastful\ntalk. Your enemies are more powerful than you think, and your own\npeople utterly defenceless against them.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Carr apologized, \"and I'll listen to all you have to say.\nSurely your prince has not given his life in vain.\" He was ashamed\nbefore this scientist of Europa.\n\nA tinkling feminine voice from the next room called something in the\nEuropan tongue.\n\nDetis raised his head proudly and his frown softened at the sound of\ndainty footsteps. His voice was a caress as he replied.\n\nA vision of feminine loveliness stood framed in the doorway and the\nvisitors rose hastily from their seats. Carr gazed into eyes of the\ndeepest blue he had ever seen. Small in stature though this girl of\nEuropa was--not more than five feet tall--she had the form of a\ngoddess and the face of an angel. He was flushing to the roots of his\nhair. Could feel it spread. What an ass he was anyway! Anyone'd think\nhe'd never seen a woman in all his thirty-five years!\n\n\"My daughter, Ora, gentlemen,\" said Detis.\n\nThe girl's eyes had widened as she looked at the huge Martian with the\nfunny black box on his back. They dropped demurely when turned to\nthose of the handsome Terrestrial.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, in Cos, \"I didn't know you had callers.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Vlor-urdin_\n\nThe time passed quickly in Pala-dar, city of the golden domes. Detis\nspent many hours in the laboratory with his two visitors and the fair\nOra was usually at his side. She was an efficient helper to her father\nand a gracious hostess to the guests.\n\nThe amazement of the visitors grew apace as the wonders of Europan\nscience were revealed to them. They sat by the hour at the illuminated\nscreen of the rulden, that remarkable astronomical instrument which\nbrought the surfaces of distant celestial bodies within a few feet of\ntheir eyes, and the sounds of the streets and the jungles to their\nears. It was no longer a mystery how the language of Cos had become so\nfamiliar to these people.\n\nThey learned of the origin of the races that inhabited Europa and\nGanymede. Ages before, it was necessary for the peoples of the then\nthickly populated Jupiter to cast about for new homes due to the\ncooling of the surface of that planet. Life was becoming unbearable.\nIn those days there were two dominant races on the mother body, a\ngentle and peaceful people of great scientific accomplishment and a\nrace of savage brutes who, while very clever with their hands, were of\nlesser mental strength and of a quarrelsome and fighting disposition.\n\nToward the last the population of both main countries was reduced to\nbut a few survivors, and the intelligent race had discovered a means\nof traversing space and was prepared to leave the planet for the more\nlivable satellite--Europa. Learning of these plans, the others made a\ntreaty of perpetual peace as a price for their passage to another\nsatellite--Ganymede. The migration began and the two satellites were\nsettled by the separate bands of pioneers and their new lives begun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe perpetual treaty had not been broken since, but the energies of\nthe warlike descendants of those first settlers of Ganymede were\nexpended in casting about for new fields to conquer. Through the ages\nthey cast increasingly covetous eyes on those inner planets, Mars,\nTerra and Venus. Not having the advantage of the Rulden, they knew of\nthese bodies only what could be seen through their own crude optical\ninstruments and what they had learned by word of mouth from certain\nrenegade Europans they were able to bribe.\n\nWhile their neighbors of the smaller satellite were engaged in\npeaceful pursuits, tilling the soil and making excellent homes for\nthemselves, the dwellers on Ganymede were fashioning instruments of\nwarfare and building a fleet of space-ships to carry them to their\nintended victims. It was a religion with them; they could think of\nnothing else. An unscrupulous scientist of Europa sold himself to them\nseveral generations previously and it was this scientist who had made\nthe plans for their space-fliers and had contrived the deadly weapons\nwith which they were armed. He likewise taught them the language of\nCos and it now was spoken universally throughout Ganymede in\nanticipation of the glorious days of conquest.\n\n\"You honestly believe them able to do this?\" asked Carr, still\nskeptical after two days of discussion.\n\n\"I know it as a certainty,\" Detis replied solemnly. \"It is only during\nthe past generation we have learned of the completeness and awfulness\nof their preparations. Your people can not combat their sound-ray.\nWith it they can remain outside the vision of those on the surface and\nset the tall buildings of your cities in harmonic vibrations that will\nbring them down in ruins about the ears of the populace.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There'll be nothing left for them to take if they destroy all our\ncities: nowhere for them to live. I don't get it.\"\n\n\"Only a few will be destroyed completely, to terrify the rest of the\ninhabitants of your worlds. Others will be depopulated by means of\nvibrations that will kill off the citizens without harming the cities\nthemselves--vibrations which are capable of blanketing a large area\nand raising the body temperature of all living things therein to a\npoint where death will ensue in a very few minutes. Other vibrations\nwill paralyze all electrical equipment on the planet and make it\nimpossible for your ships of the air to set out to give battle, even\nwere they properly armed.\"\n\n\"Looks bad, Carr,\" said Mado glumly.\n\n\"It does that. We've got to go back and carry the warning.\"\n\n\"I fear it is too late,\" said Detis. \"Much time will be needed in\nwhich to develop a defense and surely it can not be done within the\nthree isini before they set forth--about four of your days.\"\n\n\"They leave that soon?\" Carr was taken aback.\n\n\"Yes, with their one hundred and twenty vessels; forty to each of your\nthree planets; seventeen hundred men to a vessel.\"\n\nCarr jumped to his feet. \"By the heat devils of Mercury!\" he roared,\n\"well go to their lousy little satellite and find a way to prevent\nit!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOra gazed at his flushed face with unconcealed admiration.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" exploded Mado. \"What can we do with the _Nomad_?\"\n\n\"Her D-ray can do plenty of damage.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they'd have us down before we could account for five of\ntheir vessels. It's no use, I tell you.\"\n\nBut Carr was stubborn. \"We'll pay them a call anyway. I'll bet we can\ndope out some way of putting it over on them. Are you game?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm game. I'll go anywhere you will. But it's a fool idea\njust the same.\"\n\n\"Maybe so. Maybe not. Anyway--let's go.\"\n\n\"Just a moment, gentlemen,\" Detis interposed. \"How about me?\"\n\nCarr stared at him and saw that his eyes shone with excitement. \"Why,\nI believe you'd like to go with us!\" he exclaimed admiringly.\n\n\"I would, indeed.\"\n\n\"Come on then. We're off.\" He was impatient to be gone.\n\nDetis busied himself with a small apparatus that folded into a compact\ncase, explaining that it was one that might prove useful. Ora left the\nroom but quickly returned. She too carried a small case, and she had\ndonned a snug fitting leather garment that covered her from neck to\nknees.\n\n\"What's this?\" demanded Carr. \"Surely Miss Ora does not intend to come\nwith us?\"\n\n\"She never leaves my side,\" said Detis proudly.\n\n\"Nothing doing!\" Carr stated emphatically. \"There'll be plenty of\ndanger on this trip. Well have no woman along--least of all your\ncharming daughter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado was leaving everything to his friend, but he grinned in\nanticipation when he saw the look of anger on the girl's face.\n\nShe stamped her little foot and faced Carr valiantly. \"See here, Mr.\nCarr Parker!\" she stormed. \"I'm no weakling. I'm the daughter of my\nfather and where he goes I go. You'll take me or I'll never speak to\nyou again.\"\n\nCarr flushed. He was accustomed to his own way in most things and\nentirely unused to the ways of the gentler sex. He could have shaken\nthe little vixen! But now she was standing before him and there was\nsomething in those great blue eyes besides anger; something that set\nhis heart pounding madly.\n\n\"All right!\" he agreed desperately, \"have your own way.\"\n\nHe turned on his heel and strode to the door. Giving in to this slip\nof a girl! What a fool he was! But it would be great at that to have\nher along in the _Nomad_.\n\nThey found the public square deserted, the gilded dwellings hung with\nsomber colors in mourning for Carli. Ora and Detis were very quiet and\npreoccupied when they entered the _Nomad_. The five isini of\nlamentation for the young prince had not yet passed.\n\nThe two Europans were delighted with the appointments and mechanisms\nof the little vessel from Mars. They investigated every nook and\ncranny of its interior during the journey and were voluble in their\npraise of its inventor and builder. Neither had ever set foot in a\nspace-flier and each was seized with a longing to explore space with\nthese two strangers from the inner planets. They would make a couple\nof good vagabonds along with Mado and himself, Carr thought as they\nexpressed their feelings. But there was more serious business at hand.\nThey were nearing Ganymede.\n\n\"Where'll we land, Detis?\" Mado called from the control cabin.\n\n\"Vlor-urdin. That is their chief city. I'll guide you to the\nlocation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey took up their places at the ports and scanned the surface of the\nsatellite as Mado dropped the ship into its atmosphere. A far\ndifferent scene was presented than on Europa. The land was seamed and\nscarred, the colors of the foliage somber. Grays and browns\npredominated and the jungles seemed impenetrable. A river swung into\nview and its waters were black as the deepest night, its flow\nsluggish. A rank mist hung over the surface.\n\n\"The river of Charis!\" exclaimed Detis. \"Follow it, Mado. No, the\nother direction. There! It leads directly to Vlor-urdin.\"\n\nBy good chance they had entered the atmosphere at a point not far from\ntheir destination. In less than an hour by the _Nomad's_ chronometer\nthe towers of Vlor-urdin were sighted.\n\nIt was a larger city than Pala-dar and of vastly different appearance.\nA hollow square of squat buildings enclosed the vast workshops and\nstorage space of the fleet of war vessels. Their huge spherical bulks\nrose from their cradles in tier after tier that stretched as far as\nthe eye could reach when the _Nomad_ had dropped to a level but\nslightly above the tips of the highest spires. The spires were\neverywhere, decorative towers at the corners of the squat buildings.\nEverything was black, the vessels of the fleet, the squat buildings\nand the spires of Vlor-urdin. Death was in the air. Rank vapor drifted\nin through the opened ports. There was silence in the city below them\nand silence in the _Nomad_.\n\nOra shuddered and drew closer to him. Carr was aware of her nearness\nand a lump rose in his throat. A horrible fear assailed him. Fear for\nthe safety of the dainty Europan at his side. He found her hand;\ncovered it protectingly with his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Rapaju_\n\nDetis was setting up and adjusting the complicated mechanisms of his\nlittle black case. A dozen vacuum tubes lighted, and a murmur of\nthrobbing energy came from a helix of shining metallic ribbon that\ntopped the whole. Flexible cables led to a cap-like contrivance which\nDetis placed on his head. He frowned in concentration.\n\n\"The psycho-ray apparatus.\" Ora explained. \"He's sending a message to\nthe city.\"\n\nEvidently the influence of the ray was directive. They had no inkling\nof the thoughts transmitted from the alert brain of the scientist but,\nfrom the look of satisfaction on his face, they could see that he was\nobtaining the desired contact.\n\n\"Rapaju,\" he exclaimed, switching off the power of his instrument,\n\"commander of the fleet of the Llotta. I have advised him of our\narrival. Told him that a Martian and a Terrestrial wish to treat with\nhim concerning the proposed invasion of their planets. His answering\nthought first was of fiercest rage, then conciliatory in nature. He'll\nreceive you and listen to your arguments, though he promises nothing.\nIs that satisfactory?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Carr and Mado were agreed. At least it would give them a chance\nto look over the ground and to make plans, should any occur to them.\n\nThe _Nomad_ circled over the heart of the city and soon Mado saw a\nsuitable landing space. They settled gracefully in an open area close\nby the building indicated by Detis as that of the administration\nofficials of the city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA group of squat, sullen Llotta awaited them and, without speaking a\nword either of hatred or welcome, led them into the forbidding\nentrance of the building. Close-set, beady eyes; unbelievably flat\nfeatures of chalky whiteness; chunky bowed legs, bare and hairy; long\narms with huge dangling paws--these were the outstanding\ncharacteristics of the Llotta. Mado stared straight before him,\nrefusing to display any great interest in the loathsome creatures, but\nCarr was frankly curious and as frankly disapproving.\n\nRapaju leered maliciously when the four voyagers stood before him. He\nlooked the incarnation of all that was evil and vile, a monster among\nmonsters. Sensing him to be the more aggressive of the two visitors\nfrom doomed planets, he addressed his remarks to Carr.\n\n\"You come to plead with Rapaju,\" he sneered, his Cos tinged with an\noutlandish accent, \"to beg for the worthless lives of your\ncompatriots; for the wealth of your cities?\"\n\n\"We come to reason with you,\" replied Carr haughtily, \"if you are\ncapable of reasoning. What is this incredible thing you are planning?\"\n\nMado gasped at the effrontery of his friend. But Carr was oblivious of\nthe warning looks cast in his direction.\n\n\"Enough of that!\" snapped Rapaju. \"I'll do the talking--you the\nreasoning. I've a proposition to make to you, and if you know what's\nbest, you'll agree. Otherwise you'll be first of the Terrestrials to\ndie. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Clear enough, all right,\" growled Carr. \"What do you mean--a\nproposition?\"\n\n\"Ha! I thought you'd listen. My offer is the lives of you and your\ncompanion in exchange for your assistance in guiding my fleet to the\ncapital cities of your countries. Not that our plans will be changed\nif you refuse, but that much time will be saved in this manner and\nquick victory made certain without undue sacrifice of valuable\nproperty.\"\n\n\"You--you--!\" Carr stammered in anger. But there was no use in raising\na rumpus--now. They'd only kill him. Something might be accomplished\nif he pretended to accede. \"Go on with your story,\" he finished\nlamely.\n\n\"In addition to sparing your lives I'll place you both in high\nposition after we seize your respective planets. Make you chief\nofficers in the prison lands we intend to establish for your\ncountrymen. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Will you give us time to talk it over and think about it?\"\n\n\"Until the hour of departure, if you wish.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr bowed, avoiding Mado's questioning eyes. He looked at Ora where\nshe stood at the side of Detis. She flashed him a guarded smile. He\nknew that she understood.\n\nRapaju relaxed. He was confident he could bribe these puerile\nforeigners to help him in the great venture. And sadly he needed such\nhelp. The Llotta were not navigators. Their knowledge of the heavens\nwas sadly incomplete. They had no maps of the surfaces of the planets\nto be visited. Their simultaneous blows would be far more effective\nand the campaign much shorter if they could choose the most vital\ncenters for the initial attacks.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"that we understand one another, let us talk further\nof the plans. Then you will be able to consider carefully before\nmaking your decision.\"\n\nRapaju could be diplomatic when he wished. Carr longed to sink his\nfingers in the hairy throat. But he smiled hypocritically and found an\nopportunity to wink meaningly at Mado. This was going to be good! And\nwho knew?--perhaps they might find some way to outwit these mad\nsavages. To think of them in control of the inner planets was\nrevolting.\n\nThey retired to a small room with Rapaju and four of his lieutenants,\nDetis and Ora accompanying them. Ora sat close to Carr at the circular\ntable in Rapaju's council. Carr thought grimly of the board meetings\nin far away New York.\n\nRapaju talked. He told of the armament of his vessels, painting vivid\npictures of the destruction to be wrought in the cities of Terra, of\nMars and Venus. His great hairy paws clutched at imaginary riches when\nhe spoke glowingly of the plundering to follow. He spoke of the women\nof the inner planets and Carr half rose from his seat when he observed\nthe lecherous glitter in his beady eyes. Ora! Great God, was she safe\nhere? He stole a glance at the girl and a recurrence of the awful fear\nsurged through him. In her leather garment, close fitting and severe,\nshe looked like a boy. Perhaps they would not know. Besides, there was\nthe perpetual treaty with Europa. It always had been observed, Detis\nsaid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Rapaju expanded upon the glories to come he told perforce of many\nof the details of the plans. One thing stood out in Carr's mind: the\nvessels of the Llotta were not equal to the _Nomad_ in many respects.\nThey must carry their entire supply of fuel from the starting point\nand this was calculated as but a small percentage in excess of that\nrequired to carry them to their destinations. Their speed was not as\ngreat as the _Nomad's_ by at least a third. If the _Nomad_ led the\nfleet from Ganymede they might be able to get them off their course;\ncause them to run out of fuel out in the vacuum and absolute zero of\nspace. He kicked Mado under the table and arose to ask a few leading\nquestions.\n\nOra was whispering to her father and he nodded his head as if in\ncomplete agreement with what she was saying. These two were not\ndeceived by his apparent traitorous talk, but Mado was aghast. Carr\nwondered if Rapaju believed him as did his friend.\n\n\"We'll do it, Rapaju,\" he stated finally. \"In our ship, the _Nomad_,\nwe'll guide you across the trackless wastes of the heavens. We'll take\nyou to our capital cities; point out to you the richest of the\nindustrial centers. We have no love for our own worlds. Mado and I\ndeserted them for a life of vagabondage amongst the stars. We ask no\nreward other than that we be permitted to leave once more on our\ntravels, to roam space as we choose.\"\n\nMado attempted to voice an objection but Carr's hand was heavy on his\nshoulder. \"Shut up, you fool!\" he hissed in his ear. \"Can't you trust\nme?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRapaju's eyes seemed to draw closer together as he returned Carr's\nunflinching stare. He walked around the table and stood at the side of\nthe tall Terrestrial. Suddenly he grasped Ora's jacket, tore it open\nat the throat. He ran his hairy fingers over the bare shoulder of the\nshrinking girl and gurgled his delight at the velvet smoothness of her\nskin.\n\nWith a roar like a wild animal Carr was upon him, bearing him to the\nfloor. His fingers were in that hairy throat, where they had itched to\ntwine.\n\n\"Dirty, filthy beast!\" he was snarling. \"Lay your foul hands on Ora,\nwill you? Say your prayers, if you know any, you swine!\"\n\nThen his muscles went limp and he was jerked to his feet by a terrible\nforce, a force that sent him reeling and gasping against the wall. One\nof Rapaju's lieutenants stood before him with a tiny weapon in his\nhand, the weapon which had released the paralyzing gas he breathed. He\nwas choking; suffocating. A black mist rose before him. He felt his\nknees give way. Dimly, as in a dream, he saw that Ora was in Detis'\narms. Rapaju was on his feet, fingering his neck and laughing\nhorribly.\n\n\"The treaty, Rapaju!\" Detis was shouting.\n\nOra was sobbing. Mado was in the hands of two of the vile Llotta,\nstruggling wildly to free himself. The Martian's eyes accused him. He\nshut his own and groaned. Opened them again. But it was no use.\nEverything in the room was whirling now, crazily. He fought to regain\nhis senses, crawled weakly toward the squat figure of Rapaju where it\nswayed and twisted and spun around. Then all was darkness. The gas had\ntaken its toll.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_The Expedition_\n\nCarr awakened to a sense of wordless disgust. Fool that he was to\nspill the beans as he had! All set to put one over on the leader of\nthe Llotta, then to come a cropper like this! He knew he had been\nspared for a purpose. The gas was not intended to kill, only to render\nhim helpless for a time. He opened his eyes to the light of a familiar\nroom. He had awakened before in this bed. It was his own cabin on\nboard the _Nomad_. What had happened? Had he dreamed it all. Europa,\nOra, Rapaju--all of it? He sat up and felt of his aching head.\n\n\"Oh, are you awake?\" a soft voice greeted him.\n\n\"Ora!\" he exclaimed. It was indeed she, beautiful as ever.\n\n\"Sh-h,\" she warned, placing the tip of a finger to his lips. \"They'll\nhear us.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Rapaju--his two guards. They're in the control cabin with father and\nMado.\"\n\n\"What? They've taken the _Nomad_?\"\n\n\"Yes. We're under way. They've forced Mado to guide them but do not\ntrust him. Rapaju spared you as he believes you more capable. He'll\nhold you to your word.\"\n\n\"Lord! But what are you doing here?\"\n\nOra dropped her eyes. \"He--Rapaju--\" she said, \"inferred from your\naction in assaulting him that you were very fond of me. He holds me as\na hostage for your good behavior. Father volunteered to come along. He\npersuaded Rapaju to allow it. Swore allegiance to his cause. Of course\nhe wouldn't leave me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr gazed at her in admiration of her courage. She had been nursing\nhim, too! What a girl she was!\n\n\"Ora,\" he said huskily, \"Rapaju was right. I am fond of you. More than\nfond: I love you. I never knew I could feel this way.\"\n\n\"Oh Carr, you mustn't!\" She drew back as he scrambled to his feet.\n\"They'll find us. We must not show that we care. Rapaju is a beast. He\nwants me for himself and is delaying the time only until you have\nbrought the fleet safely to the inner planets and to their great\ncities. He--\"\n\n\"The skunk! Wants you himself, does he? Why, why didn't I kill him?\nBut Ora, you said--you do care--\"\n\n\"Ha! I thought so!\" Rapaju stood in the doorway, grinning mockingly at\nthe pair. \"The impetuous Terrestrial is up and about. Back at his old\ngame!\"\n\n\"Please, please, for my sake, Carr!\" Ora pressed him back as he\ntensed his muscles for a spring.\n\n\"Sorry I was so slow,\" Carr grated, over her shoulder. \"Another five\nseconds, Rapaju, and I'd have had your windpipe out by the roots.\"\n\nRapaju scowled darkly and fingered his throat. \"But, my dear Carr, you\nwere too slow,\" he said, \"and I live--and shall live--while you shall\ndie. Meanwhile you'll carry out your agreement. Come, Ora.\"\n\nThe girl hesitated a moment, then with a pleading glance at Carr\nstepped from the room.\n\n\"All right now, Parker,\" snapped Rapaju. \"Into your clothes and into\nthe pilot's seat. You'll stay there, too, till the journey's over. Get\nbusy!\"\n\nOne of his guards had appeared in the doorway. Carr knew that\nresistance was useless. Besides, seated at those controls, he might\nthink of something. Rapaju'd never get Ora if he could help it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado's shoulders drooped and his face was haggard and drawn, but he\nsummoned a smile when he saw Carr.\n\n\"Hello, Carr,\" he said. \"You all right?\"\n\n\"Sure. Rapaju says I've got to take the controls.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Mado shrugged his broad shoulders and slipped from the\npilot's seat. Two ugly Llotta guards were watching, ray-pistols in\nhand. \"The chart is corrected, Carr, and--\"\n\n\"Never mind the conversation!\" Rapaju snarled. \"There'll be no talk\nbetween you at all. Beat it to your cabin, Mado.\"\n\nThe Martian glowered and made as if to retort hotly.\n\n\"But Rapaju,\" Detis interposed, speaking from his position at one of\nthe ports, \"they'll have to consult regarding the course of the\nvessel. Mado is more familiar than Carr with the navigation of space.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" roared Rapaju. \"I know what I am doing. And, what's more,\nyou'll not converse with them, either! I'm running this expedition,\nand I'm not taking any chances.\"\n\nDetis subsided and followed Mado through the passage to the sleeping\ncabins.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ensuing silence was ominous. Carr could feel the eyes of the\nLlotta upon him as he examined the adjustments of the controls and\npeeped through the telescope. A glance at the velocity indicator\nshowed him they were traveling at a rate of eight hundred miles a\nsecond. He studied the chart and soon made out their position. Jupiter\nwas a hundred million miles behind them and they were heading almost\ndue sunward. The automatic control mechanism was not functioning.\nEvidently Mado had kept this a secret--and for a purpose. He wished he\ncould talk with his friend. They'd plan something.\n\n\"Like your job?\" Rapaju was gloating over this Terrestrial who had\ndared to lay hands upon him.\n\n\"Yes, but not the company.\" Carr was disdainful.\n\n\"You'll like it less before I've finished with you. And get this\nstraight. You think we're dependent on you to guide us to the inner\nplanets, and that we'll not harm any of you until they are reached.\nDon't fool yourself! I've watched Mado and I've spent much time in the\nexcellent library of the _Nomad_. I've learned plenty about the\nnavigation of space and can reach those planets as quickly and\ndirectly as you. But it pleases me to see you work, so work you shall.\nI'll check you carefully, and don't think you can deceive me. Don't\ntry to depart from the true course. The sun is my check as it is\nyours, and I'll keep constant tab on our position. Get it?\"\n\n\"A rather long speech, Rapaju.\" Carr grinned into the evil face of the\ncommander.\n\n\"Still defiant, eh? Suits me, Carr Parker. We'll have some nice talks\nhere, and then--when it pleases me--you'll suffer. You shall live to\nsee your home city crash in utter ruin; your people slain, starved,\nbeaten. And, above all, there's Ora--\"\n\n\"Don't defile her name in your ugly mouth, you--!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr bit his tongue to keep back the torrent of invectives that sprang\nto his lips. This would never do! He'd get himself bumped off before\nthey were well started. And while there was life there was hope. He'd\nstick to his guns and think; think and plan. If only he could have a\nfew words with Mado. They must get out of this mess. There must be a\nway! There must!\n\nRapaju was laughing in triumph. Thought he had cowed him, did he?\nBoastful savage! If he could navigate the _Nomad_ himself, why didn't\nhe? Liar! He and Mado were godsends to him, and he knew it! His speech\nat the council table had been the real truth.\n\nForeign thoughts entered his mind. Detis, good old Detis, was using\nhis thought apparatus in his own cabin! He paid no attention to the\nwords of Rapaju when he left the control room. Detis was on the job!\nBetween them they'd outwit this devil of Ganymede.\n\n\"Keep your courage,\" came the message. \"I've read the thoughts of Mado\nand he bids you examine the chart carefully. He's made some notations\nin the ancient language of Mars. The automatic control of the _Nomad_\ncan be used when necessary. He has not advised Rapaju of its\nexistence.\"\n\nCarr was encouraged and he concentrated on a suitable reply. But,\nthough he did not consciously will it, his thoughts were of Ora.\n\nInstantly there came the reassurance of her father. \"Ora is not in\nimmediate danger. Rapaju is saving her for his revenge on you. And I'm\nwatching her constantly. A ray-pistol is concealed in my clothing, its\ncharge ready for the foul creature in case he should lay hands on her.\nBut you must plan an escape, and salvation for your worlds. Examine\nthe chart at once.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked from the corner of his eye and saw that one of the Llotta\nguards was watching intently. He peered into the eye-piece of the\ntelescope; made an inconsequential change in one of the adjustments.\nThe guard stirred but did not arise. He looked at the chart with new\ninterest, scanned its markings carefully. What had Mado marked for his\nattention? There were hundreds of notations, some in Cos and a few in\nthe ancient Martian, all in Mado's painstaking chirography.\n\nAh, there it was! A tiny spot almost on their course, with Mado's\nminute notation. Sargasso Sea! What did it mean? Did Mado intend to\nlead the fleet into the embrace of that dreadful monster they had so\nfortunately escaped? An excellent idea to save the inner planets. But\nsuicide for them! He'd do it though, if it weren't for Ora. She was so\nsweet and innocent. She must not die; must not suffer. Another way\nmust be found. He groaned aloud as he realized that her predicament\nwas the result of his own bullheadedness. If only he hadn't insisted\non the trip to Ganymede. But then there was the problem of preserving\nthe civilization of the inner planets. It had to be met.\n\nThere was a commotion behind him; a feminine shriek from the after\ncabins; loud shoutings from the beast called Rapaju. Carr's heart\nskipped a beat. He was paralyzed with fear. But only for an instant.\nWith a bellow of rage he whirled around and started for the door,\ncharging the two guards with head down and arms flailing.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_Nemesis_\n\nThe Llotta did not use their ray-pistols. They were too busy\nattempting to elude the mad rushes of the powerful Terrestrial.\nBesides, there were good reasons they should not kill him--yet. Carr\ndrove one of them halfway down the passageway with a well-planted\npunch. The other was on his back, hairy legs twined around his waist,\nan arm under his chin, drawing his head back with a steady and\nterrible pressure. He whirled around, trying to shake off his beastly\nantagonist.\n\nBut these powerful legs and arms held fast. He tore at the hairy\nankles where they crossed in the pit of his stomach; wrenched them\nfree. Still the creature clung to him, twisting his head until it\nseemed his neck must break. He found a waving foot with his right\nhand; wrenched it mightily. There was a sharp snap and the foot\ndangled limp in his fingers. He had broken the ankle. With a howl of\npain his assailant let go and dropped to the floor to crawl away like\na whipped cur.\n\nIn a flash Carr saw that the brute was reaching for his ray-pistol\nwhere it had dropped during the encounter. He kicked it from the reach\nof that hairy paw and sprang after it. With one of those little\nweapons in his hands the odds would change! His fingers closed on its\ngrip just as Ora rushed into the room, closely followed by Rapaju,\nwhose distorted features were terrible to behold. The cabin was full\nof them now; the guard he had first knocked down; the lust-crazed\ncommander--the one with the broken ankle. All but Detis and Mado. Carr\nfaced them alone.\n\nSo close was Rapaju to the girl that he dared not use the pistol, and\nnow the uninjured guard was circling him, trying to get in a position\nwhere he could use his ray-pistol without endangering his commander.\nCarr fumbled for the release of the weapon he held in his hand; found\nit. The guard threw himself to the floor when he saw it raised;\nshouted a warning. But it was too late. The deadly ray had sped on its\nmission of death; struck him full in the middle. The twisted body lay\nstill a moment and then collapsed like a punctured balloon, leaving\nhis scant clothing in a limp heap--empty. A worthy miniature of the\nD-ray, this little weapon!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to face Rapaju and saw that he was shielding himself with\nOra's body. She had fainted and now hung drooping in the arms of the\nbeast. Where was Mado? Detis? Good God--he'd killed them! Carr thought\nof that little spot on the chart. Must be very close now. They'd pass\nso near there'd be no escape. But he could not reach the controls\nwithout taking his eyes from Rapaju. That would have to wait.\n\nRapaju was backing toward the door, still holding the limp figure of\nthe girl before him. The injured guard lay moaning on the floor.\n\n\"Drop her, you devil!\" Carr shouted desperately as he saw that Rapaju\nsoon would reach the passageway.\n\nThen suddenly he reached for the controls and pushed the energy lever\nto full speed forward. He braced himself for the shock of acceleration\nand saw Rapaju and Ora thrown backward into the passageway, the girl's\nbody cushioned by that of her captor as they were flung violently to\nthe floor. Madly he rushed to the narrow entrance and tore at the\nhairy arms that encircled the slender waist of the girl. He jerked the\nsnarling commander of the Llotta expedition to his feet and slammed\nhim against the metal wall.\n\n\"Now, you damn pig,\" he grunted, \"I'll finish the job. Dirty scum of a\nrotten world!\"\n\nHe dragged his victim into the control cabin and threw him to the\nfloor. But Rapaju was like an eel. He wriggled from under him and\nsnatched from the heap of clothing the ray-pistol of the disintegrated\nguard. With a yelp of triumph he rose to his knees and leveled the\nweapon.\n\nA well placed kick sent it spinning and Carr was upon him. He snapped\nback the head with a terrible punch; then lifted the dazed creature to\nhis feet and stepped back.\n\n\"Stand up and take it like a man!\" he roared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRapaju shook his head to clear it and rushed in with a bellow of rage.\nJust what Carr wanted! Starting almost from the floor, his right came\nup to meet the vicious jaw with a crack that told of the terrific\npower behind it. Lifted from his feet and hurled half way across the\nroom by the impact, Rapaju lay motionless where he fell.\n\nCarr was at the telescope. Their speed was close to fifteen hundred\nmiles a second. The monstrous mass of Mado's Sargasso Sea loomed close\nin his vision. Off their course by a hundred miles or more. They'd\nmiss it all right. He had the situation in hand now on board the\n_Nomad_. But how about the fleet behind them? He thought fast and\nfuriously. Another two minutes and they'd pass the thing; the\ninexplicable horror which had accounted for the golden sphere of the\nEuropans. Could he use it? Suppose the fleet of the enemy--\n\nThe idea was full of possibilities.\n\nHe rushed to the stern compartment, and scanned the heavens for the\nmassed body of spheres he knew would be the fleet of the Llotta. At\nthis speed they must have fallen far behind. Yes, there they were. Not\nso far behind at that. The battle in the control room must have been a\nshorter one than it had seemed. He returned quickly to the controls\nand reversed the energy, to give the fleet a chance to catch up to\nhim.\n\nCloser came that mass of whitish jelly. And now it was much larger\nthan before. The terrible creature, for living matter it was, beyond\ndoubt, was growing with the rapidity of a rising flood. Great\ntentacles of its horrid translucent substance reached in all\ndirections for possible victims. He sickened at the sight. But what a\nfate for the fleet of the Llotta! If only he could maneuver them into\nits influence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe changed his course slightly and headed directly for the monster,\nagain increasing speed. Perhaps--if he calculated the forces\ncorrectly--he could dive through it again with the D-ray to clear a\npath. But no. It was a miracle they had escaped before, and now the\nvicious thing was more than double its previous size. Once more he\naltered his course. He'd cross in front of the thing; skim it as close\nas he dared and shoot from its influence on the far side. The greater\nmass of the enemy vessels and their lack of a quick-acting repulsive\nforce would prove their undoing.\n\nFull speed ahead. A rapid mental calculation--an educated guess,\nrather--and he set the automatic control. Turning around to start for\nthe stern compartment, he saw that Ora had recovered from her swoon\nand now stood swaying weakly in the passageway.\n\n\"Ora!\" he exclaimed delightedly. He rushed to her side and supported\nher in a tender embrace.\n\n\"Rapaju?\" she questioned with horror in her eyes.\n\n\"Won't bother you for a while, dear. But your father--Mado?\"\n\n\"He gassed them. They'll recover.\" The brave girl had regained her\ncomposure.\n\n\"Good! But, come! Time's short.\" He half carried her to the rear,\nberating himself the while for his inability to pay her closer\nattention. With arms still around her he placed her at one of the\nstern ports.\n\n\"What is it, Carr?\" She sensed his excitement.\n\n\"The fleet--see! We'll destroy them.\"\n\nThe spherical vessels were close behind, huddled together in mass\nformation and following the _Nomad_ blindly.\n\n\"How, Carr?\"\n\n\"Lead them into it. Wait tall you see! There's a--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Nomad_ lurched, and changed direction. Cold fear clutched at his\nthroat. That devil of a guard! Why hadn't he killed him? He dashed\nthrough the passage, Ora at his heels.\n\nSure enough, the crippled guard had dragged himself to the controls;\nwas manipulating the energy director as he had seen Mado do. They were\nheading directly for the terrible monster of the heavens!\n\nNo need now to peer through the telescope. The thing was visible to\nthe naked eye. No power could save them! Carr hurled himself at the\nguard and tore at the hairy paw which gripped the lever. The throbbing\nof strange energies filled the air of the room, and Carr's brain\npulsed with the maddening rhythm. The red discharge appeared at the\nprojections of the control panels. He forgot the fleet of the Llotta,\nforgot the menace to his own world. Only Ora mattered now, and he had\nnot the power to save her!\n\nAs in a daze he knew he was wrenching mightily at the body of the\npowerful minion of Rapaju. His fingers encountered heated metal--one\nof the ray-pistols. He felt the intense vibration of the weapon as its\ncharge was released. But he still lived. The beast who held it had\nmissed! Dimly he was conscious of the screams of Ora; of the yielding\nof the creature who fought him. An animal cry registered on his\nconsciousness and he shook the suddenly limp Llotta from him. He knew\nsomehow that his last enemy was gone.\n\nA quick glance showed him that Ora was still on her feet, braced\nagainst the wall. The red veil was before his eyes. He grasped the\ncontrols, and fought desperately to keep his strength and senses. A\nstreamer of horrid whiteness swung across his vision; slithered\nclammily over the glass of one of the forward ports. They were into\nthe thing! It was the end! He groaned aloud as he fumbled with the\nmechanisms and strove to formulate a plan of escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fleet, he knew, was just behind. An enormous mass. The repulsive\nenergy astern would be terrific. He turned it full on. The whiteness\nobscured his vision. Then it was gone once more. A single streamer\nwaved before him and encompassed them. The movement of these members\nmust be inconceivably rapid, else they'd be invisible at the speed the\n_Nomad_ was traveling. Full speed ahead. The repulsion full on in the\ndirection of the center of the mass as well as astern. The framework\nof the _Nomad_ creaked protestingly from the terrific forces that tore\nat her vitals.\n\nThen suddenly they were released. The _Nomad_ was shooting off into\nspace. The resultant of those combined forces had done the trick. Only\nthe edge of that devil-fish of space, had they touched. Free--they\nwere free of the monster! The red veil lifted. He rushed to Ora's\nside. She was kneeling at one of the floor ports, breathing heavily\nbut unharmed.\n\nBelow them they saw the swiftly receding mass: the fleet of the Llotta\ndiving headlong, drawn inexorably into the rapacious embrace of the\nvile creature of the heavens. An instant the awful whiteness of the\nthing closed in greedily about the many spheres of the fleet;\nswallowed them from sight and contorted madly and with seeming glee\nover the triumph. Then, in a burst of blinding incandescence, it was\ngone. The monster, the fleet--everything--blasted into nothingness.\nThe fuel storage compartments of the vessels of Ganymede had exploded!\nThe heavens were rid of the inexplicable growing menace; the inner\nplanets were saved from a terrible invasion. And the _Nomad_ was safe.\nOra, Detis, Mado--all were safe!\n\nAt his side Ora was trembling. Gently he raised her to her feet, and\ntook her into his arms.\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_Vagabonds All_\n\nTogether they cared for Detis and Mado; made them comfortable in their\nbunks until the time when the effects of the gas would wear off.\nLucky it was that Rapaju had used the gas pistol rather than the ray.\nPerhaps it had been a mistake. Or perhaps he had needed the scientific\nknowledge of Detis, the familiarity with the inner planets that was\nMado's. At any rate, they had no delusions regarding his designs on\nOra or his hatred of Carr. By his own passions had the commander of\nthe fleet been led to the error that cost him his life and made\npossible the destruction of his fleet.\n\nCarr was torn by conflicting emotions. The delectable little Europan\nwas most disturbing. He'd never had much use for the other sex--on\nEarth. Too dominating, most of them. And always thrown at his head by\ndesigning parents for his money. But Ora was different! Her very\nnearness set his pulses racing. And he knew that she cared for him as\nhe did for her. Those moments in the control cabin after the\nexplosion! But something had come over him since he cut loose from the\nold life. Wanderlust--that was it. He'd never go back. Neither would\nhe be content to settle down to a domestic life in Pala-dar. Wanted to\nbe up and going somewhere.\n\n\"Oh, Carr, Carr!\" Ora's voice called to him. \"Mado is awake. He wants\nyou.\"\n\nGood old Mado! Why couldn't they just continue on their way as they\nhad started out? Roaming the universe in search of other adventures!\nBut the silvery tinkle of Ora's laughter reached his ears. She was\nirresistible! He forgot his doubts as he hurried to his friend's\ncabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado was staring at the Europan maiden with a ludicrous expression of\nastonishment--gawping, Carr called it. And Ora was laughing at him.\n\n\"Your friend,\" she gurgled, \"doesn't believe he's alive, or that I am,\nor you. Tell him we are.\"\n\nCarr grinned. Mado did look funny at that. \"Hello, old sock,\" he said,\n\"had a bad dream?\"\n\n\"Did I? Oh boy!\" Mado rocked to and fro, his head in his hands. Then\nhe displayed sudden intense interest. \"Rapaju?\" he asked. \"His\nguards--the fleet--what's happened?\"\n\n\"Ah ha! Now you know you're alive!\" Carr laughed. \"But the others are\ndead and gone. The fleet's gone to smash--and how!\"\n\n\"But Carr. How did you do it? Tell me!\"\n\nMado threw off his covers and clapped his friend on the back, a\nresounding thump that brought a gasp from Ora.\n\n\"Your Sargasso Sea did it. And it's a thing of the past, too. Wait\ntill I tell you about it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOra tripped from the room as Carr sat on the edge of the bunk to spin\nhis yarn.\n\n\"But man alive!\" Mado exclaimed when the story was finished. \"Don't\nyou know you've done a miraculous thing? I'd never have had the nerve.\nThat damn creature out there had more than four times its former\nattracting energy. That's what made it impossible for the fleet to get\naway. And you--you lucky devil--you just doped it out right. The fleet\nof the Llotta gave you a tremendous push from astern when you used the\nrepulsive energy. If they hadn't been there with their enormous mass\nto react against we'd all have been mincemeat now along with the\nLlotta. You Terrestrials sure can think fast! Me, now--Lord, if it had\nbeen me, I'd have thought of it after my spirit had departed to its\nreward--or punishment. Glory be! It's the greatest thing I ever heard\nof.\"\n\n\"Rats! You'd have done the same as I did. Probably would have missed\nit a mile instead of nearly getting caught as I did. A good thing the\nfleet's gone, though. Mars and Terra--Venus, too--they'll never know\nhow close it was for them. Wouldn't have sense enough to appreciate\nit, anyway.\"\n\n\"They would if they ever got a taste of what the Llotta planned. But\nwhat's wrong with you Carr? You act sore. Want to go home?\"\n\n\"Me? Don't be like that. No--I'd like to carry on as we planned.\nThere's Saturn, Uranus and Neptune yet; Planet 9; a flock of\nsatellites and asteroids. Oh, dammit!\"\n\nMado looked his amazement. \"Well, what's to prevent it?\" he demanded.\n\"The _Nomad's_ still here, and so are we. I'm just as anxious to keep\ngoing as you are. Why not?\"\n\nBut Carr did not reply. Why not, indeed? He strode from the cabin and\ninto the control room. The _Nomad_ was drifting in space, subject only\nto natural forces that swung it in a vast orbit around the sun. He\nstarted the generators and drove the vessel from her temporary orbit\nwith rapid acceleration. Out--out into the jeweled blackness of the\nheavens. There was Jupiter out there, a bright orb that came suddenly\nvery near when he centered it on the cross-hairs of the telescope.\n\nThe excited voices of Ora and Detis came to his ears. The booming\nspeech of Mado. Why couldn't he be sensible and companionable as they\nwere? But a perverse demon kept him at the controls. They'd think him\na grouch. Well, maybe he was! But the vastness of the universe\nbeckoned. New worlds to explore; mysteries to be solved; a life of\ncountless new experiences! Anyone'd think he was the owner of the\n_Nomad_, the way he planned for the future.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were in the control cabin now--Mado and Detis and Ora. A moment\nhe hesitated, eyes glued to the telescope. Then, with a petulant\ngesture, he reached for the automatic control; locked it. Shouldn't be\nthis way. They'd think him an awful cad. And they'd be right! He\nwhirled to face them.\n\nDetis was smiling. Mado gazed owlishly solemn. Ora clung to the arm of\nher father, and her long lashes hid the blue eyes that had played such\nhavoc with the emotions of the Terrestrial.\n\n\"Carr,\" said Detis, gently, \"we must thank you. You saved our lives,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Aw, forget it. Saved my own, too, didn't I? By a lucky break.\"\n\n\"It wasn't luck, Carr.\" Detis was gripping his hand now. \"It was sheer\ngrit and brains. You had them both. If you hadn't used them we'd all\nbe corpses--or disintegrated--excepting Ora, perhaps. And you know the\nfate that awaited her. Instead, we are alive and well. The fleet is\ngone. Rapaju's body and that of his guard drift nameless in space\nwhere you disposed of them through the air-lock of the _Nomad_. The\ninner planets need fear no future invasion, for the resources of\nGanymede have been expended in the one huge enterprise that has\nfailed. All through your quick wit and bravery. No, it wasn't luck.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Detis.\" Carr returned the pressure of the scientist's hand,\nsmiling sheepishly. He pushed him away after a moment. He didn't want\ntheir gratitude or praise. Didn't know what he wanted. Ora still\navoided meeting his gaze. \"Nonsense,\" he repeated. \"And now, please\nleave me. You, Detis. Mado, too. I'd like to be alone for a\nwhile--with Ora. Mind?\"\n\nMado's owlish look broadened to a knowing grin as he backed into the\npassageway. Detis collided with the huge Martian in his eagerness to\nbe out of the room. They were alone and Carr was on his feet. Nothing\nmattered now--excepting Ora. Suddenly she was in his arms, the\nfragrance of her hair in his nostrils.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStar gazing, the two of them. It was ridiculous! But the wonders of\nthe universe held a new beauty now for Carr. The distant suns had\ntaken on added brilliance. Still they beckoned.\n\n\"Carr,\" the girl whispered, after a time, \"where are we going?\"\n\n\"To Europa. Your home.\"\n\n\"To--to stay?\"\n\n\"No.\" Carr was suddenly confident; determined. \"We'll stop there to\nbreak the news. Then we'll be wedded, you and I, according to the\ncustom of your people. Our honeymoon--years of it--will be spent in\nthe _Nomad_, roving the universe. Mado'll agree, I know. Wanderers of\nthe heavens we'll be, Ora. But we'll have each other; and when\nwe've--you've--had enough of it, I'll be ready to settle down.\nAnywhere you say. Are you game?\"\n\n\"Oh, Carr! How did you guess? It's just as we'd planned. Father and\nMado and I. Didn't think I'd go, did you, you stupid old dear?\"\n\n\"Why--why Ora.\" Carr was stammering now. He'd thought he was being\nmasterful--making the plans himself. But she'd beat him to it, the\nadorable little minx! \"I was a bit afraid,\" he admitted; \"and I still\ncan't believe that it's actually true. You're sure you want to?\"\n\n\"Positive. Why Carr, I've always been a vagabond at heart. And now\nthat I've found you we'll just be vagabonds together. Father and Mado\nwill leave us very much to each other. Their scientific leanings, you\nknow. And--oh--it'll just be wonderful!\"\n\n\"It's you that'll make it wonderful, sweetheart.\"\n\nCarr drew her close. The stars shone still more brightly and beckoned\nanew. Vagabonds, all of them! Like the gypsies of old, but with vastly\nmore territory to roam. The humdrum routine of his old life seemed\nvery far behind. He wondered what Courtney Davis would say if he could\nsee him now. Wordless happiness had come to him, and he let his\nthoughts wander out into the limitless expanse of the heavens. Star\ngazing still--just he and Ora.\n\n\n\n\nReader's Corner\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\n\n_From a Science Fiction \"Fiend\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I agree with you about the reprinting of old stories,\n     because you would only force older Science Fiction readers\n     to read the same stuff that they have read before. Any\n     Science Fiction fiend like myself will surely have the\n     reprinted story in his collection of magazines.\n\n     The size of your magazine is perfect, but your paper is not\n     very good. As for me, I don't care about your paper because\n     your stories are so very good that the paper doesn't matter.\n\n     My favorite story, and one of the best stories that I have\n     ever read so far, is \"Murder Madness.\" It has a very\n     original idea and holds your interest from the very start.\n\n     I am also for a more often publication of your magazine;\n     about twice a month--Rupert Jones, New York, N. Y.\n\n\n_Valuable Suggestions_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The July issue of Astounding Stories is one of the best\n     issues you have so far published.\n\n     Arthur J. Burks sure is a master at writing Science Fiction\n     tales. The first installment of \"Earth, the Marauder\" was\n     swell. Harl Vincent is another very good author. His\n     novelette, \"The Terror of Air-Level Six,\" was a close\n     second. \"The Forgotten Planet,\" by S. P. Wright, \"Beyond the\n     Heaviside Layer,\" by S. P. Meek and \"From an Amber Block,\"\n     by Tom Curry were all good stories.\n\n     The cover illustration was the best yet. I hope that the\n     next dozen covers do not have blue backgrounds. Other colors\n     you might have are green, red, pink, orange, yellow, black\n     and light and dark purple.\n\n     When will Edmond Hamilton's first story be published in\n     Astounding Stories? Have you received any stories by Stanton\n     Coblentz, A. Hyatt Verrill, Ed Earl Repp, John W. Campbell,\n     Jr., Edward E. Chappelow and Edgar Rice Burroughs yet?\n\n     Why not have a page devoted to the authors? You could print\n     a picture and tell something about one author each month. I\n     think that an illustration representing Science Fiction\n     would look good on the contents page.\n\n     I hope that Wesso will soon be illustrating every story in\n     Astounding Stories, or that you will obtain another artist\n     equally as good (if possible).\n\n     Is it possible for you to use a better and thinner grade of\n     paper? I save all my Astounding Stories and I like them to\n     be thin so they will not take up so much room.--Jack Darrow,\n     4225 N. Spaulding Ave., Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n_Not Yet_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just received your July issue of Astounding Stories,\n     and I must say that it is the best yet.\n\n     The only thing wrong with it, in my opinion, is that it is\n     too small; the size should be at least 9x12. Also it should\n     be a semi-monthly, or at least accompanied by a quarterly\n     and annual.\n\n     The stories in the July issue are wonderful, all except\n     Murray Leinster's serial, which does not belong in your\n     magazine.\n\n     If you have any intention of putting an annual or a\n     quarterly on the market, will you be so kind as to\n     communicate with me as I am very much interested in your\n     magazine.--Louis Wentzler, 1933 Woodbine St., Brooklyn, N.\n     Y.\n\n\n_\"Ever Since\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I want to tell you what I think of your new magazine. I\n     think it's great.\n\n     I stopped in a drug store and saw Astounding Stories on the\n     newsstand. I bought it and have been buying it ever since. I\n     am fourteen years old, but I am interested in science. Why\n     not get a story by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and some more by\n     Ray Cummings?\n\n     I wish success to your wonderful magazine.--Wm. McCalvy,\n     1244 Beech St., St. Paul, Minn.\n\n\n_\"Not One Poor Story Yet\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I agree with you that reprints should absolutely be kept out\n     of your magazine. I admit that there are many stories of\n     unusual merit among the reprints but I favor new and fresher\n     stories.\n\n     In your last issue (June) I consider \"The Moon Master\" as\n     being the best story, closely followed by \"Out of the\n     Dreadful Depths.\" \"The Cavern World\" came next, followed by\n     \"Giants of the Ray,\" \"Brigands of the Moon\" and \"Murder\n     Madness.\"\n\n     I have not found one poor story in your magazine yet, and\n     never expect to.\n\n     I, for one, favor a larger sized magazine with a five cent\n     increase in price, or, at least, if the magazine must remain\n     small, I would like to see a quarterly out on the third\n     Thursday every three months.\n\n     I am extremely pleased to see that an interplanetary story\n     by R. F. Starzl will appear in your next issue. Please have\n     more of his stories if possible.--Forrest James Ackerman,\n     530 Staples Ave., San Francisco, Calif.\n\n\n_Likes Present Size_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Best stories in the last two issues: C. D. Willard's \"Out of\n     the Dreadful Depths\" (Excellent); Chas. W. Diffin's \"The\n     Moon Master\" (Very Good); Sewell P. Wright's \"Forgotten\n     Planet\" (Fairly Good).\n\n     I am a new reader, but interested in these kinds of\n     stories. I am pleased to see that your readers criticize\n     freely. A story that will please one reader will not\n     interest another, perhaps, and it may not be the fault of\n     the author's ability so much as that he doesn't like that\n     type of story.\n\n     \"Out of the Dreadful Depths,\" by C. Willard is the best\n     story I've read for some time. I could not see a single way\n     it could be improved. \"The Moon Master,\" by Chas. Diffin was\n     just as good but I didn't like the ending so well. I\n     certainly hope Mr. Diffin will write more stories like it,\n     especially using his same three leading characters. \"The\n     Forgotten Planet,\" by Mr. Wright, was well written and\n     pretty good in spite of the fact that I don't like that type\n     of story so well.\n\n     \"Murder Madness,\" by Murray Leinster was well written and\n     the characters interesting and real but I didn't like his\n     subject. I hope for more and different stories from him.\n     \"Earth, the Marauder,\" by Arthur J. Burks looks as though it\n     was going to be a record winner for me--accomplish the\n     impossible, and make a good story from a story of the\n     future.\n\n     I don't like horror stories, crazy stories and stories\n     written far into the future, as \"Brigands of the Moon.\"\n     These stories make light of the vast distances of space and\n     are too weird, droll and fail to give a single shiver down\n     my old backbone. They are strange and inhabited by strange\n     people. No story can give the faintest idea of the space\n     between those mighty suns of the universe. Most of them have\n     more imagination than scientific knowledge. \"Earth, the\n     Marauder,\" an exception.\n\n     I would much rather hear stories of primeval days of the\n     lost Atlantis before Earth was populated with scientific\n     beings, when the cave man looked up at the unknown, then so\n     near to him. At the moon, which was then so close, and\n     uninhabited by superior beings. Tales of superstition and\n     all mystery stories of the unknown. I like interplanetary\n     stories, if not written too far into the future.\n\n     I like the present size and shape of your magazine. Best\n     wishes for the success of your magazine.--An Interested\n     Reader, Goffstown, N. H.\n\n\n_Likes_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished reading the July issue of Astounding\n     Stories and I think every story is simply great, especially\n     \"The Terror of Air-Level Six.\" That sure is a story! \"The\n     Forgotten Planet\" is a corker, too!\n\n     While reading the letters in \"The Readers' Corner\" I noticed\n     that almost everyone has a hankering for Edgar Rice\n     Burroughs' stories. Believe it or not, I'm wild about his\n     stories myself and I'm looking forward to reading his\n     stories in Astounding Stories. It won't make any difference\n     if they'll be originals or reprints, so long as they're\n     Burroughs!\n\n     Ray Cummings is another one of my favorites and I always\n     read his stories first. His \"Brigands of the Moon\" hit me in\n     the right spot. \"The Moon Master\" in the June issue was\n     also a very fine story.\n\n     Now about this argument about reprinted stories. I think\n     that if, at least, one reprinted story appeared in each\n     issue of Astounding Stories, it wouldn't hurt its\n     reputation. Here are some reprints that hit the ceiling:\n     \"The War in the Air,\" by Wells; \"Tarranto, the Conqueror,\"\n     by Cummings; \"The Conquest of Mars,\" by Serviss. I'm sure\n     the readers would enjoy reading them. But if you are\n     persistent about avoiding reprints then we'll have to do\n     without them.--Paul Nikolaieff, 4325 S. Seeley Ave.,\n     Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n_Wants Sequel_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read every issue of Astounding Stories though I can\n     barely afford it. I like it very much. The best novels were,\n     in order: 1. \"The Moon Master\"; 2. \"Phantoms of Reality\"; 3.\n     \"Spawn of the Stars\"; 4. \"Terror of Air-Level Six.\"\n\n     In the July issue you published a story, \"Earth, the\n     Marauder,\" which promises to be even better than the\n     \"Skylark of Space\" that once came out in another magazine. I\n     like Harl Vincent, Ray Cummings, Arthur Burks, and Martian\n     stories best. Interplanetary stories always agree with me.\n     Burroughs is an excellent author. I like his Martian books.\n     \"The Beetle Horde\" in the first two issues was very good.\n     But why not give a sequel about the other and more terrible\n     creatures in the earth whom the madman spoke of? Fourth\n     dimensionals are sometimes good. You should have reprints by\n     Burroughs, Cummings and Merritt. I am eagerly waiting for\n     the next issue. Do not enlarge the magazine because I cannot\n     afford it. Don't publish stories like \"From an Amber Block.\"\n     They're rotten. Publish more future and interplanetary\n     stories.--Joseph Edelman, 721 De Kalb Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n_Stands Pat_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read all the issues of A. S. since the date of\n     publication and think that there is no other magazine like\n     it on the market. I would like to offer a few suggestions\n     contrary to most of your readers (i.e., Jack Darrow & Chas.\n     Barret):\n\n     1.--Keep magazine in present size and price.\n\n     2.--Issue it only once a month. If it was issued\n     semi-monthly the writers would soon run out of ideas; and\n     the readers would get sick of it if they read it so often\n     anyway.\n\n     3.--Keep up the style of stories now running, i.e., keep the\n     science a little in the background. Do not let it monopolize\n     the story.\n\n     I get other magazines that do not follow the last mentioned\n     rule and the result is the stories are full of machines\n     going 10,000 miles per hour, etc.; pink, black, purple and\n     eleventeen other colored rays. As a result the stories are\n     drier than the Sahara Desert.\n\n     The illustrations are fine (O.K.) as they are.--Walter\n     O'Brien, 6 Hageman Pl., North Bergen, N. J.\n\n\n_Trial by Readers_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     When Astounding Stories first appeared on the newsstands, a\n     brand new Science Fiction magazine, I was prejudiced against\n     it as a competitor to the existing magazines--one that might\n     carry an inferior quality of Science Fiction so closely\n     approaching the supernatural as to practically disregard\n     science. In a few cases, as with very good writers like A.\n     Merritt and H. P. Lovecraft, this is permissible, but,\n     otherwise, not at all so. In the first issue, \"The Stolen\n     Mind\" seemed to bear me out, but, then, there was \"Tanks.\" I\n     bought the next issue--much better! And then the third\n     showed \"The Soul Master,\" very well written, but not quite\n     science, as related. Yet, \"Cold Light\" held me on, and\n     \"Brigands of the Moon.\" There is no danger of my dropping\n     off now!\n\n     In the current issue, \"Murder Madness\" and \"The Power and\n     the Glory\" stand out as mile-posts in the history of Science\n     Fiction. The rest are not far behind, though, as a matter of\n     fact, \"Beyond the Heaviside Layer\" and \"Earth, the Marauder\"\n     have more discernible flaws than the rest. Just for example,\n     a layer of organic matter would raise Cain with astronomy,\n     due to refraction. Air is bad enough. But the writing\n     overwhelms the error. You have certainly assembled a group\n     of excellent authors, new and old, and I am glad to see the\n     promise of R. F. Starzl in the next issue. His \"Madness of\n     the Dust\" is one of the most naturally written\n     interplanetary stories I have read--logical and clear, just\n     as it would happen to anybody.\n\n     And now for the big question--that of reprints. You seem to\n     have already decided the answer, and have defended your\n     action well, but I wonder if it is well enough. By far your\n     best argument is your last--\"authors must eat\"--with which I\n     have no quarrel at all. Still, one classic serial a year, or\n     at most two, might not prove too harmful. Following back, I\n     reach a statement concerning \"The Saturday Evening Post.\" In\n     the past it has published hundreds of the world's best\n     stories, and never reprinted. True. But why? Because these\n     stories are all available in book form, in libraries and\n     book stores, in original or new editions or in the Grosset\n     and Dunlap list of perpetually printed best sellers. It is\n     possible to read them for years after publication. But try\n     to find the past masterpieces of Science Fiction. With the\n     exception of Burroughs' books, most were never printed in\n     book form. Even books by Wells and Verne, classics of their\n     kind are gone, totally gone, even from the shelves of\n     libraries. Many of Verne's best stories were never\n     translated from the French. And the other classics of which\n     readers write, classics familiar to most of us only by name\n     and a few lucky tastes of others, newer works by the same\n     authors, are absolutely gone--annihilated. Their best works\n     are beyond the reach of the reader. Only by republication,\n     in magazine or book, can they be revived in an age when they\n     will be remembered and preserved--an age awake to science\n     and Science Fiction. Other magazines are doing it, one or\n     two to the year, and it may be that you need not reprint;\n     but the reservoir of the past is large, and a few cannot\n     drain it. This leads to your first argument, that better\n     stories are being written to-day. They are--better than the\n     average of the past--but not better than the classics. It\n     would be folly to say that because the short story is a\n     modern development, and because Galsworthy or Walpole or\n     Reimarch are better than the average of yesterday, to our\n     present tastes, that the classics of the past should be\n     scrapped.\n\n     The analogy, I feel, is good. The classics of general\n     literature have their place in history. The classics of\n     Science Fiction should have theirs. There are dozens better\n     than the general run of present work, by A. Merritt, Homer\n     Eon Flint, George Allan England, Austin Hall, John Taine,\n     Garret P. Serviss, Ralph Milne Farley, Ray Cummings, and\n     others that stood out in an age when Science Fiction was\n     considered pure phantasy or imaginative \"trash.\" In the\n     present age, they would be still better, and this time they\n     would not be lost to the world, for there are publishers and\n     readers who would preserve them. You may adhere to your\n     decision, but, to my mind, and, I think to far more than 1%\n     of other minds, reprints of classics are essential, actually\n     vitally necessary. Try to find out what a ballot would show.\n     Again, from the author's point of view. Up to now, Burroughs\n     has had all the breaks as to book publication. Now Ray\n     Cummings and others are being published. \"An author must\n     eat.\" Give him a chance, by reviving his best efforts, and\n     bringing them to public attention, so that a publisher will\n     find them worthy of publication. Most of the masters of\n     Science Fiction are alive--give them a chance to eat. Too, a\n     great many of the best modern authors are modern readers:\n     ask them if they would be willing to see one of the best\n     stories of the past re-issued each year, stories unpublished\n     in existing magazines for ten years or more. I certainly\n     hope you will alter your decision.\n\n     And now to reverse some other decisions of readers. The size\n     is quite all right and very handy for binding purposes, Mr.\n     Mack to the contrary. Incidentally, the staples are so\n     placed as to make binding simple. Also contrary to Mr.\n     Darrow, I prefer the artist Gould, to Wesso, for interior\n     illustrations, though Wesso is best for mechanical\n     illustrations. Incidentally, give us the name of the artist\n     for each story, especially when the illustrations are\n     unsigned, as in the April issue. Wesso's best cover for you\n     has been that for April, illustrating \"Monsters of Moyen.\"\n     It shows his best style very well.\n\n     As to my favorite type of Science Fiction, any kind, if well\n     written, will do. As it happens, the king of authors, A.\n     Merritt, has a type all his own, as Mr. Bryant notes, which\n     is unbeatable, and my favorite. However, at times, a good\n     writer may fall down in his fundamental assumptions. I don't\n     care where or how far he goes, so long as he starts with\n     something that present-day science does not deny. Here is\n     where \"The Soul Master\" fell down, and, even more so, \"The\n     Soul Snatcher.\" Better leave souls and astrals and egos\n     alone, except in very, very rare cases, when an author turns\n     up who can make you believe in them as mechanical entities.\n\n     As a Science Fiction fan, a student of chemistry, and a\n     hopeful author, I will probably write to \"The Readers'\n     Corner\" as often as I want to blow off steam regarding\n     science or fiction or the way in which you are running the\n     magazine. I hope I won't be considered an utter nuisance,\n     and will be given a trial by jury--a jury of readers.--P.\n     Schuyler Miller, 302 So. Ten Broeck St., Scotia, New York.\n\n\n\"_Handy to Hold_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I wish to say that I have the seven numbers of Astounding\n     Stories that have been issued thus far and I have read them\n     through ever word. It is wonderful, and there is no word of\n     fault to be uttered concerning any of them. I think \"Murder\n     Madness\" is the best story you have printed so far, but they\n     are all good in different ways.\n\n     You received some letters that surprise me. How anyone can\n     ask you to change the make-up to the blanket sheet form is\n     more than I can see. It is so handy to hold and to read as\n     it is now. I do hope you will not change it.\n\n     No, there is so much that one wants to read these days that\n     I do not advocate issuing twice a month. One issue each\n     month is just right. But I do wish you would increase the\n     number of pages to at least the number in Five Novels\n     magazine. Of course, you would want 25c. for it then, and\n     that is all right.\n\n     Am glad that you refuse to give us reprints. We do not want\n     them.\n\n     Astounding Stories is a gem, and I hope to read it for the\n     remainder of my life. Keep right on with the good\n     work.--Will S. Cushing, 21 Cottage St., Abington,\n     Massachusetts.\n\n\n_We Hope So, Too_!\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Your July issue of Astounding Stories was wonderful. Your\n     magazine is improving greatly. \"Murder Madness\" is a great\n     story, and \"Earth, the Marauder,\" is one of the best stories\n     I have ever read. I hope the other parts of it are just as\n     interesting as the first part.--Mick Scotts, 115 W. 16th\n     Ave., Gary, Indiana.\n\n\n_Another Sequel_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Well, I have so much to say, or rather would like to say for\n     your magazine. I like it in every detail but one, which is\n     waiting a whole month for the rest of my stories.\n\n     I wish you would give us the third sequel of \"Out of the\n     Ocean's Depths.\" Let the young scientist discover a way to\n     perform matrimony between the girl of the ocean and the man,\n     and then let their child live either in or out of water.\n     There could be two more good stories or sequels of \"Out of\n     the Ocean's Depths.\" I like them all.\n\n     I liked \"Murder Madness,\" too. It seems as though it is\n     really real, and not fiction. I wish you would get the book\n     out twice a month.--Mrs. B. R. Woods, Cotte, Arkansas.\n\n\n_From Author to Author_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Since Astounding Stories began you have published a goodly\n     number of really remarkable stories, chief among which, in\n     my estimation, are the following: \"Spawn of the Stars,\" by\n     C. W. Diffin; \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by Ray Cummings;\n     \"Monsters of Moyen,\" by Arthur J. Burks; \"The Atom Smasher,\"\n     by Victor Rousseau; and \"The Moon Master,\" C. W. Diffin.\n\n     But none of these can compare with Diffin's last short\n     story, \"The Power and the Glory,\" which appeared in the last\n     (July) issue. For originality of theme, clever phraseology\n     and excellent literary craftsmanship it stands alone--a\n     little masterpiece. Its author should be congratulated.\n\n     To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Diffin is a newcomer in\n     Science Fiction. The first story of his that I read was\n     \"Spawn of the Stars.\" Keep his pen busy, Mr. Editor; he's\n     valuable--an' I don't mean maybe!\n\n     If I could write a story like \"The Power and the Glory,\" I'd\n     certainly congratulate myself!--L. A. Eshbach, 225 Chestnut\n     St., Reading, Pa.\n\n\n\"_Held Me Spellbound_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I happened to read one of your books the other\n     day--Astounding Stories is the one--and I was very much\n     taken up with it. I found that it was a very interesting\n     book, indeed. I have no fear in saying that it held me\n     spellbound from the start till the finish. The one that I\n     happened to buy was the issue of May, 1930, and the story\n     that gripped me most was \"Brigands of the Moon.\" It was very\n     thrilling, indeed, and I am very sorry I could not obtain\n     the previous copies so as to start at the beginning. But,\n     however, I am able to obtain a copy every month and am very\n     pleased, as I would hate to miss a copy again.\n\n     Well, I hope this letter will reach you safely. Remember me\n     as a contented reader of your magazine.--Geo. Young, 447\n     Canning St., Nth. Carlton N. 4, Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\n_We Are Printing It_!\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     It seems that you have taken a wrong slant on my letter\n     which you published recently. True, I did give you a long\n     list of stories which I wanted to see, but I didn't mean\n     that you should publish only reprints, no new stories. Far\n     from it. Instead, I'd suggest that you give us a classic,\n     say, every six months. This arrangement ought to be okay\n     with everyone. That's that for reprints.\n\n     About the stories and the authors, they're all right.\n     There's one thing that I like about you that I don't find in\n     the other Science Fiction magazines. With the very first\n     issue you started off with the authors that are wanted by\n     everyone who reads this type of literature. You began with\n     Cummings, Rousseau, Meek and Leinster. Hm-m, let's see. And\n     you're keeping up the good system by having added Vincent,\n     Starzl, Burks, Curry, Miss Lorraine, Hamilton, etc. But you\n     don't escape entirely unscathed, for the other magazines\n     give us stories from authors which haven't as yet written a\n     story which appeared in your columns. Let's see; besides the\n     stars above, let's add to the galaxy Keller (three cheers),\n     Breuer, Smith (his story, \"The Skylark of Space,\" ought to\n     have about six sequels), the late Mr. Serviss, Verrill, Poe,\n     Wells, Verne, Flint (o-o-oh, for that \"Blind Spot\"), Hall,\n     England, Hasta (one story by him is all I've read, but it\n     only whetted my appetite), and Simmons. Oh, yes, the two\n     Taines, the detective of Dr. Keller's and the author. But\n     there's something missing. Hm-m--ah, A. Merritt! What a\n     writer! How could I have forgotten him? Which reminds me of\n     Burroughs who has been left out in the rain for quite a\n     while. He belongs back in the fold.\n\n     Mr. Editor, do you remember way back when you said we should\n     write in to you to tell you of the stories we want and that\n     you would get them for us? Of course, you do. Stories and\n     authors cannot be parted, so get those authors I've listed\n     above and forget about the stories, for they'll all be good.\n\n     I do not kick about any particular author for the reason\n     that if I tried to write on the same subject they picked out\n     and are picking, my work would be pretty different from what\n     they'd produce, and their works would be the ones that would\n     be published. Please don't read that twice; I hope to be a\n     contributor very soon.\n\n     In my opinion you should enlarge the size of the magazine,\n     but for heaven's sake don't increase the departments. Every\n     day that we read a paper we learn of what science is doing.\n     And, at the end of the month we read the same thing in a\n     magazine which should give us a story instead. The price is\n     just right. But, even if the magazine were enlarged and the\n     price boosted to a quarter, do you really think that we get\n     enough material to devour? No! Then what? Get out a\n     Quarterly! And please don't wait about that for the next ten\n     years.\n\n     This is a pretty lengthy letter and I don't expect you to\n     print it but I want you to get the views of at least one\n     devoted reader--Isidore Mansen, 544 Myrtle Ave., Brooklyn,\n     N. Y.\n\n\n_Every Single One_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I certainly received a pleasant surprise when I glanced at\n     the table of contents for the August issue. When one sees\n     Victor Rousseau, R. F. Starzl, Murray Leinster, Harl\n     Vincent, and Edmond Hamilton, one knows that the issue is\n     bound to be a good one. I wish to congratulate you on the\n     way you have been running Astounding Stories. If you intend\n     to keep giving us the authors you are now, throughout your\n     whole career, you are a law-breaker. What I mean by that is\n     that no other magazine has kept a high grade of authors very\n     long. The old magazines on the market have once had stories\n     by the authors you are giving us now, but they never kept\n     those authors long. If you keep the authors you have now you\n     may well be assured of success.\n\n     \"Silver Dome\" undoubtedly copped the prize for this issue.\n     It could not have been better. \"The Lord of Space\" was a\n     very good story. \"The Planet of Dread\" was another very good\n     story. \"The Second Satellite,\" by Hamilton, was excellent.\n     For once in his life Hamilton has written a story that has\n     not the same old plot all his other stories have! I wish to\n     congratulate him on the best story he has ever written! \"The\n     Flying City\" was the same thing all over again. The world in\n     danger and suddenly our magnificent hero comes along, takes\n     a hand, and presto the danger is all over. Of course, he has\n     to meet the beautiful girl and fall in love with her, and at\n     the end of the story marry her! Remember, history repeats\n     itself. Have you ever heard of the world being saved by one\n     man? No! Neither have I. The world will never be saved by\n     one man. Therefore, all those stories are \"the bunk.\"\n     \"Murder Madness\" was wonderful. I expect to see it in the\n     talkies before long. It could be filmed easily enough,\n     couldn't it! I know it certainly would make a wonderful\n     picture. I expect to see you publish \"Murder Madness\" and\n     \"Brigands of the Moon\" in book form. If you do, I will try\n     my darnedest to get a copy. Also in my list of good authors\n     up there I forgot to mention Arthur J. Burks.\n\n     Now I wish to broach the subject of a Quarterly to you. I\n     think Astounding Stories should have one. Every other\n     Science Fiction magazine has, so let us have one, too. Won't\n     you? You can give us over twice as much as you do in the\n     monthly and charge about 50c. a copy. Have one good book and\n     several short stories in each issue; no serials. How about\n     it?\n\n     And now let's talk a little about Astounding Stories! Why\n     not cut the paper smooth, the way you do in Five Novels\n     Monthly? It would make the magazine look a lot better. It\n     would also be a lot easier to find one's place when one has\n     to lay the book down for a moment. The last reason may sound\n     trivial, but it's really annoying to try to find one's place\n     among those bulky pages. The paper you use now gives the\n     magazine an inferior appearance when compared to others of\n     its kind. It certainly would be a relief to see you use\n     better paper. Won't you please consider the points I have\n     brought out in my letter?--Gabriel Kirschner, Box 301,\n     Temple, Texas.\n\n\n\"_What Authors_!\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Astounding Stories is improving with every issue. However,\n     you would have to go far to beat the August issue. It can\n     be called an \"all star\" number. What authors! Hamilton,\n     Rousseau, Starzl, Burks, and others, all of whom are among\n     my favorite authors. The stories were so good that it is\n     almost impossible to pick out the best one. However, after\n     some thought I have finally chosen Hamilton's \"The Second\n     Satellite.\" \"Earth, the Marauder,\" is a close second. I hope\n     you have many more stories by Edmond Hamilton.\n\n     I see that the cover is the first one to be of a different\n     color. Please have a new color each month.\n\n     There are a few ways in which Astounding Stories may be\n     improved. Enough of the readers have mentioned improving the\n     quality of the paper so that I do not have to comment on\n     this. An editorial each month would improve the magazine\n     greatly.\n\n     Here's hoping that Astounding Stories becomes a semi-monthly\n     soon--very soon--Michael Fogaris, 157 Fourth St., Passiac,\n     N. J.\n\n\n_Stands Pat_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been a reader of your magazine for some time. I hope\n     to continue reading it in the future.\n\n     I notice in \"The Readers' Corner\" that some want reprints.\n     Others want the size of the magazine changed. I say, give us\n     \"fresh\" stories and leave the size of the magazine alone.\n\n     In my opinion, the best stories in your July issue were\n     \"Beyond the Heaviside Layer\" and \"Earth, the Marauder.\" They\n     were both fine.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
