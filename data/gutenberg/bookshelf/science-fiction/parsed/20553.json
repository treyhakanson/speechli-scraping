Wilson\n\n\n[Note: An astounding chronicle of two Lunarians' conquest of time and\ninterstellar space.]\n\nThe sun had dropped behind the Grimaldi plateau, although for a day\ntwilight would linger over the Oceanus Procellarum. The sky was a hazy\nblue, and out over the deeper tinted waves the full Earth swung. All the\nlong half-month it had hung there above the horizon, its light dimmed by\nthe sunshine, growing from a thin crescent to its full disk three times\nas broad as that of the sun at setting. Now in the dusk it was a great\nsilver lamp hanging over Nardos, the Beautiful, the City Built on the\nWater. The light glimmered over the tall white towers, over the white\nten-mile-long adamantine bridge running from Nardos to the shore, and\nlit up the beach where we were standing, with a brightness that seemed\nalmost that of day.\n\n\"Once more, Garth,\" I said. \"I'll get that trick yet.\"\n\nThe skin of my bare chest still smarted from the blow of his wooden\nfencing sword. If it had been the real two-handed Lunarian dueling\nsword, with its terrible mass behind a curved razor edge, the blow would\nhave produced a cut deep into the bone. It was always the same, ever\nsince Garth and I had fenced as boys with crooked laths. Back to back,\nwe could beat the whole school, but I never had a chance against him.\nPerhaps one time in ten--\n\n\"On guard!\"\n\nThe silvered swords whirled in the Earth-light. I nicked him on one\nwrist, and had to duck to escape his wild swing at my head. The wooden\nblades were now locked by the hilts above our heads. When he stepped\nback to get free, I lunged and twisted his weapon. In a beautiful\nparabola, Garth's sword sailed out into the water, and he dropped to the\nsand to nurse his right wrist.\n\n\"Confound your wrestling, Dunal. If you've broken my arm on the eve of\nmy flight--\"\n\n\"It's not even a sprain. Your wrists are weak. And I supposed you've\nalways been considerate of me? Three broken ribs!\"\n\n\"For half a cent--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was on his feet, and then Kelvar came up and laid her hand on his\nshoulder. Until a few minutes before she had been swimming in the surf,\nwatching us. The Earth-light shimmered over her white skin, still\nfaintly moist, and blazed out in blue sparkles from the jewels of the\nbreastplates and trunks she had put on.\n\nWhen she touched Garth, and he smiled, I wanted to smash in his dark\nface and then take the beating I would deserve. Yet, if she preferred\nhim-- [TN-1]And the two of us had been friends before she was born. I\nput out my hand.\n\n\"Whatever happens, Garth, we'll still be friends?\"\n\n\"Whatever happens.\"\n\nWe clasped hands.\n\n\"Garth,\" Kelvar said, \"it's getting dark. Show us your ship before you\ngo.\"\n\n\"All right.\" He had always been like that--one minute in a black rage,\nthe next perfectly agreeable. He now led the way up to a cliff hanging\nover the sea.\n\n\"There,\" said Garth, \"is the _Comet_. Our greatest step in conquering\ndistance. After I've tried it out, we can go in a year to the end of the\nuniverse. But, for a starter, how about a thousand light-years around\nRigel in six months?\" His eyes were afire. Then he calmed down.\n\"Anything I can show you?\"\n\n[Note: Editor's Note: The manuscript, of which a translation is here\npresented, was discovered by the rocket-ship expedition to the moon\nthree years ago. It was found in its box by the last crumbling ruins of\nthe great bridge mentioned in the narrative. Its final translation is a\ntribute at once to the philological skill of the Earth and to the\nmarvelous dictionary provided by Dunal, the Lunarian. Stars and lunar\nlocalities will be given their traditional Earth names; and measures of\ntime, weight, and distance have been reduced, in round numbers, to\nterrestrial equivalents. Of the space ship described, the _Comet_, no\ntrace has been found. It must be buried under the rim of one of the\nhundreds of nearby Lunar craters--the result, as some astronomers have\nlong suspected and as Dunal's story verifies, of a great swarm of\nmeteors striking the unprotected, airless moon.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had seen the _Comet_ before, but never so close. With a hull of\nshining helio-beryllium--the new light, inactive alloy of a metal and a\ngas--the ship was a cylinder about twenty feet long, by fifteen in\ndiameter, while a pointed nose stretched five feet farther at each end.\nFixed in each point was a telescopic lens, while there were windows\nalong the sides and at the top--all made, Garth informed us, of another\nform of the alloy almost as strong as the opaque variety. Running\nhalf-way out each end were four \"fins\" which served to apply the power\ndriving the craft. A light inside showed the interior to be a single\nroom, ten feet high at the center of its cylindrical ceiling, with a\nlevel floor.\n\n\"How do you know this will be the bottom?\" I asked, giving the vessel a\nshove to roll it over. But it would not budge. Garth laughed.\n\n\"Five hundred pounds of mercury and the disintegrators are under that\nfloor, while out in space I have an auxiliary gravity engine to keep my\nfeet there.\"\n\n\"You see, since your mathematical friends derived their identical\nformulas for gravity and electromagnetism, my job was pretty easy. As\nyou know, a falling body follows the line of least resistance in a field\nof distortion of space caused by mass. I bend space into another such\nfield by electromagnetic means, and the _Comet_ flies down the track.\nWorking the mercury disintegrators at full power, I can get an\nacceleration of two hundred miles per second, which will build up the\nspeed at the midpoint of my trip to almost four thousand times that of\nlight. Then I'll have to start slowing down, but at the average speed\nthe journey will take only six months or so.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But can anyone stand that acceleration?\" Kelvar asked.\n\n\"I've had it on and felt nothing. With a rocket exhaust shoving the\nship, it couldn't be done, but my gravitational field attracts the\noccupant of the _Comet_ just as much as the vessel itself.\"\n\n\"You're sure,\" I interrupted, \"that you have enough power to keep up the\nacceleration?\"\n\n\"Easily. There's a two-thirds margin of safety.\"\n\n\"And you haven't considered that it may get harder to push? You know the\nincrease of mass with velocity. You can't take one-half of the\nrelativity theory without the other. And they've actually measured the\nincrease of weight in an electron.\"\n\n\"The electron never knew it; it's all a matter of reference points. I\ncan't follow the math, but I know that from the electron's standards it\nstayed exactly the same weight. Anything else is nonsense.\"\n\n\"Well, there may be a flaw in the reasoning, but as they've worked it\nout, nothing can go faster than light. As you approach that velocity,\nthe mass keeps increasing, and with it the amount of energy required for\na new increase in speed. At the speed of light, the mass would be\ninfinite, and hence no finite energy could get you any further.\"\n\n\"Maybe so. It won't take long to find out.\"\n\nA few of the brightest stars had begun to appear. We could just see the\nparallelogram of Orion, with red Betelguese at one corner, and across\nfrom it Rigel, scintillant like a blue diamond.\n\n\"See,\" Garth said, pointing at it. \"Three months from now, that's where\nI'll be. The first man who dared to sail among the stars.\"\n\n\"Only because you don't let anyone else share the glory and the danger.\"\n\n\"Why should I? But you wouldn't go, anyway.\"\n\n\"Will you let me?\"\n\nI had him there.\n\n\"On your head be it. The _Comet_ could hold three or four in a pinch,\nand I have plenty of provisions. If you really want to take the\nchance--\"\n\n\"It won't be the first we've taken together.\"\n\n\"All right. We'll start in ten minutes.\" He went inside the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Don't go,\" Kelvar whispered, coming into the _Comet's_ shadow. \"Tell\nhim anything, but don't go.\"\n\n\"I've got to. I can't go back on my word. He'd think I was afraid.\"\n\n\"Haven't you a right to be?\"\n\n\"Garth is my friend and I'm going with him.\"\n\n\"All right. But I wish you wouldn't.\"\n\nFrom inside came the throb of engines.\n\n\"Kelvar,\" I said, \"you didn't worry when only Garth was going.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And there's less danger with two to keep watch.\"\n\n\"I know, but still....\"\n\n\"You are afraid for _me_?\"\n\n\"I am afraid for you.\"\n\nMy arm slipped around her, there in the shadow.\n\n\"And when I come back, Kelvar, we'll be married?\"\n\nIn answer, she kissed me. Then Garth was standing in the doorway of the\n_Comet_.\n\n\"Dunal, where are you?\"\n\nWe separated and came out of the shadow. I went up the plank to the\ndoor, kicking it out behind me. Kelvar waved, and I called something or\nother to her. Then the door clanged shut. Seated before the control\nboard at the front of the room, Garth held the switch for the two\nprojectors.\n\n\"Both turned up,\" he yelled over the roar of the generators. His hands\nswung over and the noise died down, but nothing else seemed to have\nhappened. I turned back again to look out the little window fixed in the\ndoor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDown far below, I could see for a moment the city of Nardos with its\ngreat white bridge, and a spot that might be Kelvar. Then there was only\nthe ocean, sparkling in the Earth-light, growing smaller, smaller. And\nthen we had shot out of the atmosphere into the glare of the sun and a\nthousand stars.\n\nOn and up we went, until the moon was a crescent with stars around it.\nThen Garth threw the power forward.\n\n\"Might as well turn in,\" he told me. \"There'll be nothing interesting\nuntil we get out of the solar system and I can put on real speed. I'll\ntake the first trick.\"\n\n\"How long watches shall we stand?\"\n\n\"Eighteen hours ought to match the way we have been living. If you have\nanother preference--\"\n\n\"No, that will be all right. And I suppose I might as well get in some\nsleep now.\"\n\nI was not really sleepy, but only dazed a little by the adventure. I\nfixed some things on the floor by one of the windows and lay down,\nswitching out the light. Through a top window the sunlight slanted down\nto fall around Garth, at his instrument board, in a bright glory. From\nmy window I could see the Earth and the gleaming stars.\n\nThe Earth was smaller than I had ever seen it before. It seemed to be\nmoving backward a little[TN-2], and even more, to be changing phase. I\nclosed my eyes, and when I opened them again, sleepily, the bright area\nwas perceptibly smaller. If I could stay awake long enough, there would\nbe only a crescent again. If I could stay awake--But I could not....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnly the rattling of dishes as Garth prepared breakfast brought me back\nto consciousness. I got to my feet sheepishly.\n\n\"How long have I slept?\"\n\n\"Twenty hours straight. You looked as if you might have gone on forever.\nIt's the lack of disturbance to indicate time. I got in a little myself,\nonce we were out of the solar system.\"\n\nA sandwich in one hand, I wandered over the vessel. It was reassuringly\nsolid and concrete. And yet there was something lacking.\n\n\"Garth,\" I asked, \"what's become of the sun?\"\n\n\"I thought you'd want to know that.\" He led me to the rear telescope.\n\n\"But I don't see anything.\"\n\n\"You haven't caught on yet. See that bright yellowish star on the edge\nof the constellation Scorpio. That's it.\"\n\nInvoluntarily, I gasped. \"Then--how far away are we?\"\n\n\"I put on full acceleration fifteen hours ago, when we passed Neptune,\nand we have covered thirty billion miles--three hundred times as far as\nfrom the moon to the sun, but only one half of one per cent of a\nlight-year.\"\n\nI was speechless, and Garth led me back to the control board. He pointed\nout the acceleration control, now turned up to its last notch forward;\nhe also showed me the dials which were used to change our direction.\n\n\"Just keep that star on the cross hairs. It's Pi Orionis, a little out\nof our course, but a good target since it is only twenty-five\nlight-years away. Half the light is deflected on this screen, with a\ndelicate photo-electric cell at its center. The instant the light of the\nstar slips off it, a relay is started which lights a red lamp here, and\nin a minute sounds a warning bell. That indicator over there shows our\napproach to any body. It works by the interaction of the object's\ngravitational field with that of my projector, and we can spot anything\nsizable an hour away. Sure you've got everything?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt all seemed clear. Then I noticed at the top three clock-like dials;\none to read days, another to record the speeds of light, and the third\nto mark light-years traveled.\n\n\"These can't really work?\" I said. \"We have no way to check our speed\nwith outer space.\"\n\n\"Not directly. This is geared with clockwork to represent an estimate\nbased on the acceleration. If your theory is right, then the dials are\nall wrong.\"\n\n\"And how long do you expect to go ahead without knowing the truth?\"\n\n\"Until we ought to be at Pi Orionis. At two weeks and twenty-five\nlight-years by the dials, if we aren't there we'll start back. By your\nfiguring, we shouldn't be yet one light-year on the way. Anything more?\"\n\n\"No, I think I can manage it.\"\n\n\"Wake me if anything's wrong. And look out for dark stars.\" Then he had\nleft me there at the controls. In five minutes he was asleep and the\nwhole ship was in my hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor hours nothing happened. Without any control of mine, the ship went\nstraight ahead. I could get up and walk about, with a weather eye on the\nboard, and never was there the flash of a danger light. But I was unable\nto feel confident, and went back to look out through the glass.\n\nThe stars were incredibly bright and clear. Right ahead were Betelguese\nand Rigel, and the great nebula of Orion still beyond. There was no\ntwinkling, but each star a bright, steady point of light. And if Garth's\nindicators were correct, we were moving toward them at a speed now\nseventy-five times that of light itself. If they were correct.... How\ncould one know, before the long two weeks were over?\n\nBut before I could begin to think of any plan, my eye was caught by the\nred lamp flashing on the panel. I pressed the attention button before\nthe alarm could ring, then started looking for the body we were in\ndanger of striking. The position indicators pointed straight ahead, but\nI could see nothing. For ten minutes I peered through the telescope, and\nstill no sign. The dials put the thing off a degree or so to the right\nnow, but that was too close. In five more minutes I would swing straight\nup and give whatever it was a wide berth.\n\nI looked out again. In the angle between the cross hairs, wasn't there a\nslight haze? In a moment it was clear. A comet, apparently, the two of\nus racing toward each other. Bigger it grew and bigger, hurtling\nforward. Would we hit?\n\nThe dials put it up a little and far off to the right, but it was still\nfrightening. The other light had come on, too, and I saw that we had\nbeen pulled off our course by the comet's attraction. I threw the nose\nover, past on the other side for leeway, then straightened up as the\nside-distance dial gave a big jump away. Though the gaseous globe,\ntailless of course away from the sun, showed as big as the full Earth,\nthe danger was past.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I watched, the comet vanished from the field of the telescope. Five\nminutes, perhaps, with the red danger light flickering all the time.\nThen, with a ghastly flare through the right hand windows, it had passed\nus.\n\nGarth sat straight up. \"What happened?\" he yelled.\n\n\"Just a comet. I got by all right.\"\n\nHe settled back, having been scarcely awake, and I turned to the board\nagain. The danger light had gone out, but the direction indicator was\nburning. The near approach of the comet had thrown us off our course by\nseveral degrees. I straightened the ship up easily, and had only a\nlittle more difficulty in stopping a rocking motion. Then again the\nempty hours of watching, gazing into the stars.\n\nPrecisely at the end of eighteen hours, Garth awakened, as if the\nconsummation of a certain number of internal processes had set off a\nlittle alarm clock in his brain. We were forty-one hours out, with a\nspeed, according to the indicator, of one hundred and twenty-eight times\nthat of light, and a total distance covered of slightly over one quarter\nof a light-year. A rather small stretch, compared to the 466 light-years\nwe had to go. But when I went back for a look out of the rear telescope,\nthe familiar stars seemed to have moved the least bit closer together,\nand the sun was no brighter than a great number of them.\n\nI slept like a log, but awakened a little before my trick was due.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nExactly on schedule, fourteen days and some hours after we had started\noff, we passed Pi Orionis. For long there had been no doubt in my mind\nthat, whatever the explanation, our acceleration was holding steady. In\nthe last few hours the star swept up to the brilliance of the sun, then\nfaded again until it was no brighter than Venus. Venus! Our sun itself\nhad been a mere dot in the rear telescope until the change in our course\nthrew it out of the field of vision.\n\nAt sixty-five light-years, twenty-three days out, Beta Eridani was\nalmost directly in our path for Rigel. Slightly less than a third of the\ndistance to the midpoint, in over half the time. But our speed was still\nincreasing 200 miles a second every second, almost four times the speed\nof light in an hour. Our watches went on with a not altogether\ndisagreeable monotony.\n\nThere was no star to mark the middle of our journey. Only, toward the\nclose of one of my watches, a blue light which I had never noticed came\non beside the indicator dials, and I saw that we had covered 233\nlight-years, half the estimated distance to Rigel. The speed marker\nindicated 3975 times the speed of light. I wakened Garth.\n\n\"You could have done it yourself,\" he complained, sleepily, \"but I\nsuppose it's just as well.\"\n\nHe went over to the board and started warming up the rear gravity\nprojector.\n\n\"We'll turn one off as the other goes on. Each take one control, and go\na notch at a time.\" He began counting, \"One, two, three ...\"\n\nOn the twentieth count, my dial was down to zero, his up to maximum\ndeceleration, and I pulled out my switch. Garth snapped sideways a lever\non the indicators. Though nothing seemed to happen, I knew that the\nspeed dial would creep backward, and the distance dial progress at a\nslower and slower rate. While I was trying to see the motion, Garth had\ngone back to bed. I turned again to the glass and looked out at Rigel,\non the cross hairs, and Kappa Orionis, over to the left, and the great\nnebula reaching over a quarter of the view with its faint gaseous\nstreamers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so we swept on through space, with Rigel a great blue glory ahead,\nand new stars, invisible at greater distances, flaring up in front of us\nand then fading into the background as we passed. For a long time we had\nbeen able to see that Rigel, as inferred from spectroscopic evidence,\nwas a double star--a fainter, greener blue companion revolving with it\naround their common center of gravity. Beyond Kappa Orionis, three\nhundred light-years from the sun, the space between the two was quite\nevident. Beyond four hundred light-years, the brilliance of the vast\nstar was so great that it dimmed all the other stars by comparison, and\nmade the nebula seem a mere faint gauze. And yet even with this gradual\nchange, our arrival was a surprise.\n\nWhen he relieved me at my watch, Garth seemed dissatisfied with our\nprogress. \"It must be farther than they've figured. I'll stick at\ntwenty-five times light speed, and slow down after we get there by\ntaking an orbit.\"\n\n\"I'd have said it was nearer than the estimate,\" I tried to argue, but\nwas too sleepy to remember my reasons. Propped up on one elbow, I looked\naround and out at the stars. There was a bright splash of light, I\nnoticed, where the telescope concentrated the radiation of Rigel at one\nspot on the screen. I slept, and then Garth was shouting in my ear:\n\n\"We're there!\"\n\nI opened my eyes, blinked, and shut them again in the glare.\n\n\"I've gone around three or four times trying to slow down. We're there,\nand there's a planet to land on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last I could see. Out the window opposite me, Rigel was a blue-white\ndisk half the size of the sun, but brighter, with the companion star a\nsort of faint reflection five or ten degrees to the side. And still\nbeyond, as I shaded my eyes, I could see swimming in the black a speck\nwith the unmistakable glow of reflected light.\n\nWith both gravity projectors in readiness, we pulled out of our orbit\nand straight across toward the planet, letting the attraction of Rigel\nfight against our still tremendous speed. For a while, the pull of the\nbig star was almost overpowering. Then we got past, and into the\ngravitational field of the planet. We spiralled down around it, looking\nfor a landing place and trying to match our speed with its rotational\nvelocity.\n\nFrom rather unreliable observations, the planet seemed a good deal\nsmaller than the moon, and yet so dense as to have a greater\ngravitational attraction. The atmosphere was cloudless, and the surface\na forbidding expanse of sand. The globe whirled at a rate that must give\nit a day of approximately five hours. We angled down, picking a spot\njust within the lighted area.\n\nA landing was quite feasible. As we broke through the atmosphere, we\ncould see that the sand, although blotched with dark patches here and\nthere, was comparatively smooth. At one place there was a level\noutcropping of rock, and over this we hung. It was hard work, watching\nthrough the single small port in the floor as we settled down. Finally\nthe view was too small to be of any use. I ran to the side window, only\nto find my eyes blinded by Rigel's blaze. Then we had landed, and almost\nat the same moment Rigel set. Half overlapped by the greater star, the\nfaint companion had been hidden in its glare. Now, in the dusk, a corner\nof it hung ghostlike on the horizon, and then too had disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI flashed on our lights, while Garth cut out the projector and the floor\ngravity machine. The increase in weight was apparent, but not\nparticularly unpleasant. After a few minutes of walking up and down I\ngot used to it.\n\nThrough a stop-cock in the wall, Garth had drawn in a tube of gas from\nthe atmosphere outside, and was analyzing it with a spectroscope.\n\n\"We can go out,\" he said. \"It's unbreathable, but we'll be able to use\nthe space suits. Mostly fluorine. It would eat your lungs out like\nthat!\"\n\n\"And the suits?\"\n\n\"Fortunately, they've been covered with helio-beryllium paint, and the\nhelmet glass is the same stuff. Not even that atmosphere can touch it. I\nsuppose there can be no life on the place. With all this sand, it would\nhave to be based on silicon instead of carbon--and it would have to\nbreathe fluorine!\"\n\nHe got out the suits--rather like a diver's with the body of\nmetal-painted cloth, and the helmet of the metal itself. On the\nshoulders was an air supply cylinder. The helmets were fixed with radio,\nso we could have talked to each other even in airless space. We said\nalmost anything to try it out.\n\n\"Glad you brought two, and we don't have to explore in shifts.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was prepared for emergencies.\"\n\n\"Shall we wait for daylight to go out?\"\n\n\"I can't see why. And these outfits will probably feel better in the\ncool. Let's see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe shot a searchlight beam out the window. There was a slight drop down\nfrom the rock where we rested, then the sandy plain stretching out. Only\nfar off were those dark patches that looked like old seaweed on a\ndried-up ocean bed, and might prove dangerous footing. The rest seemed\nhard packed.\n\nMy heart was pounding as we went into the air-lock and fastened the\ninner door behind us.\n\n\"We go straight out now,\" Garth explained. \"Coming back, it will be\nnecessary to press this button and let the pump get rid of the\npoisonous, air before going in.\"\n\nI opened the outer door and started to step out, then realized that\nthere was a five-foot drop to the ground.\n\n\"Go ahead and jump,\" Garth said. \"There's a ladder inside I should have\nbrought, but it would be too much trouble to go back through the lock\nfor it. Either of us can jump eight feet at home, and we'll get back up\nsomehow.\"\n\nI jumped, failing to allow for the slightly greater gravity, and fell\nsprawling. Garth got down more successfully, in spite of a long package\nof some sort he carried in his hand.\n\nScrambling down from the cliff and walking out on the sand, I tried to\nget used to the combination of greater weight and the awkward suit. If I\nstepped very deliberately it was all right, but an attempt to run sank\nmy feet in the sand and brought me up staggering. There was no trouble\nseeing through the glass of my helmet over wide angles. Standing on the\nelevation by the _Comet_, his space-suit shining in the light from the\nwindows, Garth looked like a metallic monster, some creature of this\nstrange world. And I must have presented to him much the same\nappearance, silhouetted dark and forbidding against the stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stars! I looked up, and beheld the most marvelous sight of the whole\ntrip--the Great Nebula of Orion seen from a distance of less than one\nhundred and fifty light-years its own width.\n\nA great luminous curtain, fifty degrees across, I could just take it all\nin with my eye. The central brilliancy as big as the sun, a smaller one\nabove it, and then the whole mass of gas stretching over the sky. The\nwhole thing aglow with the green light of nebulium and blazing with the\nstars behind it. It was stupendous, beyond words.\n\nI started to call Garth, then saw that he was looking up as well. For\nalmost half an hour I watched, as the edge of the nebula sank below the\nhorizon. Then its light began to dim. Turning, I saw that the sky\nopposite was already gray. The dawn!\n\nWhy, the sun had just set. Then I realized. It was over an hour since we\nhad landed, and a full night would be scarcely two hours and a half. If\nwe were in a summer latitude, the shorter period of darkness was natural\nenough. And yet it was still hard to believe as, within ten minutes, it\nwas as bright as Earth-light on the moon. Still clearer and clearer grew\nthe light. The stars were almost gone, the center of the nebula only a\nfaint wisp. There were no clouds to give the colors of sunrise, but a\nbluish-white radiance seemed to be trembling on the eastern horizon.\n\nAnd then, like a shot, Rigel came up into the sky. The light and heat\nstruck me like something solid, and I turned away. Even with my suit\nreflecting most of the light away, I felt noticeably warm. The _Comet_\nshone like a blinding mirror, so that it was almost impossible to see\nGarth on the plain below it. Stumbling, and shielding my eyes with my\nhand, I made my way toward him.\n\nHe was standing erect, in his hands two old Lunarian dueling swords.\nThere was hate in his voice as the radio brought it in my ears.\n\n\"Dunal, only one of us is going back to the moon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stared. Was the heat getting him? \"Hadn't we better go inside,\" I said\nquietly and somewhat soothingly.\n\nHe made no reply, but only held out one of the hilts. I took it dumbly.\nIn that instant he could have struck my head from my body, if he wished.\n\n\"But, Garth, old friend--\"\n\n\"No friend to you. You shall win Kelvar now, or I. I'm giving you a\nsporting chance. One of your light cuts letting the fluorine inside will\nbe as deadly as anything I can do. The one who goes back will tell of an\naccident, making repairs out in space. Damn you, if you don't want me to\nkill you where you stand, come on and fight.\"\n\n\"Garth, you've gone mad.\"\n\n\"I've been waiting ever since I got you to leave the moon. On guard!\"\n\nWith a rush of anger I was upon him. He tried to step back, stumbled,\nhad one knee on the ground, then hurled himself forward with a thrust at\nmy waist that I dodged only by an inch. I had to cover, and in spite of\nmyself, with the cool work of parrying, my animosity began to disappear.\n\nAnd so began one of the strangest battles that the Universe has seen.\nLumbering with our suits and the extra gravity, we circled each other\nunder the blazing sky. The blue-white of Rigel shimmered off our suits\nand the arcs of our blades as we cut and guarded--each wary now,\nrealizing that a touch meant death. As that terrible sun climbed upward\nin the sky, its heat was almost overpowering. The sweat poured off every\ninch of my body, and I gasped for breath. And still we fought on, two\nglittering metal monsters under the big blue star sweeping up to its\nnoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew now that I could never kill Garth. I could not go back to Kelvar\nwith his blood. Yet if I simply defended, sooner or later he would wear\nme down. There was just one chance. If I could disarm him, I could\nwrestle him into submission. Then he might be reasonable, or I could\ntake him home bound.\n\nI began leading for the opening I wanted, but with no result. He seemed\nresolved to tire me out. Either I must carry the fight to him, or I\nwould be beaten down. I made a wide opening, counting on dodging his\nslow stroke. I did, but he recovered too soon. Again on the other side,\nwith no better result. Still again, just getting in for a light tap on\nGarth's helmet. Then I stepped back, with guard low, and this time he\ncame on. His sword rose in a gleaming arc and hung high for a moment. I\nhad him. There were sparks of clashing, locked steel.\n\n\"Damn you, Dunal!\" He took a great step back, narrowly keeping his\nbalance on the sand. On another chance, I would trip him. My ears were\nalmost deafened by his roar, \"Come on and _fight_.\"\n\nI took a step in and to the side, and had him in the sun. He swung\nblindly, trying to cover himself with his whirling point but I had half\na dozen openings to rip his suit. When he moved to try to see, I would\nlock with him again. I watched his feet.\n\nAnd as I watched, I saw an incredible thing. Near one of Garth's feet\nthe sand was moving. It was not a slide caused by his weight;\nrather--why, it was being pushed up from below. There was a little hump,\nand suddenly it had burst open, and a stringy mass like seaweed was\ncrawling toward his leg.\n\n\"Look out, Garth,\" I yelled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow he could see through that terrible sun I do not know, but Garth\nswung through my forgotten guard with a blow square across my helmet\nglass. The force threw me to the ground, and I looked up, dazed. The\nberyllium glass had not broken to let in the fluorine-filled air, but\nGarth was standing over me.\n\n\"That's your last trick, Dunal.\" His blade rose for the kill.\n\nI was unable even to get up, but with one hand I pointed to the ground.\n\n\"Look!\" I shouted again, and on the instant the thing wound itself\naround Garth's foot.\n\nHe swung down, hacking it loose. I had got to my feet. \"Run for the\nship,\" I cried, and started off.\n\n\"Not that way.\"\n\nI looked back, and saw that I had run in the wrong direction. But it\nmade no difference. Over a whole circle around us the sand was rising,\nand directly between us and the _Comet_ there was a great green-brown\nmass. We were surrounded.\n\nWe stood staring at the creatures. Spread out to full dimensions, each\none made a sphere about four feet in diameter. In the center, a solid\nmass whose outlines were difficult to discern; and spreading out from\nthis a hundred long, thin, many-jointed arms or legs or branches or\nwhatever one could call them.\n\nThe things were not yet definitely hostile--only their circle, of\nperhaps fifty yards radius, grew continually thicker and more\nimpenetrable. Within the enclosed area, the only ripples we could see in\nthe sand were heading outward. There was to be no surprise attack from\nbelow, at least; only one in mass. What, I wondered, might be a sign of\nfriendship, to persuade them to let us go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then the circle began to close in. The things rolled over and over\non themselves, like gigantic tumbleweeds. At one point, to the right of\nthe direct route to the _Comet_, the line seemed thinner. I pointed the\nplace out to Garth.\n\n\"Break through there, and make a run for it.\"\n\nWe charged into the midst of them with swinging blades. The very\nsuddenness of our rush carried us half-way through their midst. Then\nsomething had my legs from behind. I almost fell, but succeeded in\nturning and cutting myself free. The creatures from the other side of\nthe circle must have made the hundred yards in four or five seconds. And\nthe rest had now covered the breach in front. It was hopeless.\n\nAnd so we stood back to back, hewing out a circle of protection against\nour enemies. They seemed to have no fear, and in spite of the\ndestruction our blades worked among them, they almost overcame us by\nsheer numbers and weight. It was a case of whirling our swords back and\nforth interminably in the midst of their tentacles. Against the light,\nthe long arms were a half-transparent brown. Our swords broke them in\nbright shivers. Formed from the predominant silicon of the planet, the\ncreatures were living glass!\n\nFor perhaps a quarter of an hour we were in the thick of them, hewing\nuntil I thought my arms must fall, slashing and tearing at the ones that\nhad got underfoot and were clamping their tentacles around our legs.\nOnly for the space-suits, we should have, by this time, been overpowered\nand torn into bits--and yet these garments could not be expected to hold\nindefinitely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut at last there was a breathing space. The crippled front ranks\ndragged themselves away, and there was left around us a brief area of\nsand, covered with coruscating splinters of glass. Garth got the breath\nto say something or other encouraging. It was like old days at school.\n\nOnly this time the odds were all against us. We were still a good\nhundred yards from the _Comet_, and in our path stood a solid wall of\nthe creatures. Even if we got free, they could outrace us to the goal.\nAnd with our limited strength, we could not hope to kill them all. In a\nminute or two, they would attack us again.\n\nSomehow we must fight our way as long as we lasted. Perhaps they might\nbe frightened. We threw ourselves at the side next our goal. The line\ngave perhaps a yard, then stiffened, and we found ourselves swallowed up\nin a thick cloud of brown smoke.\n\nPoison gas! It must be shot out of their bodies, at a cost so great that\nit was kept as a last resort. Through the rolling vapor it was just\npossible to see our opponents, but they made no forward move. They were\nwaiting for us to be overcome. Suppose their compound could eat through\neven our helio-beryllium? But it did not. We were safe.\n\n\"Stand still, Garth,\" I whispered, counting on the radio to carry my\nvoice. \"Let them think we're dead, and then give them a surprise.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nLong, long minutes.... If only they did not know that it was the\ncustomary thing for a dead man to fall.... Slowly they began to move in.\n\nThen Garth and I were upon them. They halted as if stupefied. We had\nhacked our way half through their mass. The rest fled, and we began\nrunning toward the _Comet_, praying that we might reach the ship before\nthey could get organized again. How we floundered through the sand in\nwild and desperate haste.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore we had covered half the distance, the pursuit began. There was no\nattempt to drag us down directly, but the two wings raced past to cut us\noff in front. At the base of the little cliff where the _Comet_ lay, the\ncircle closed.\n\n\"Jump,\" I called, and threw myself up over them toward the stone. Garth\nwould have fallen back, but I caught his hand and pulled him to safety.\nWe had won.\n\nBut had we? Joined by reinforcements from somewhere, the creatures were\npacked all around the base of the cliff and had begun to climb its\nwalls, to cut us off from the ship. We rushed separately toward the two\nsides, and they backed away. But those in front were now established on\nthe top. We stepped backward, and the whole line came on. But now we\nturned and ran for the _Comet_.\n\nWe were just able to turn again and clear them away with our swords. In\na moment others would be climbing up from behind over the ship. And the\ndoor to safety was on a level with our heads.\n\nThere was just one chance. Stamping threateningly, we cleared the things\nout for ten feet in front of us. But once we turned our backs for a\nrunning start they were at us again.\n\n\"Boost you up, Dunal,\" said Garth pantingly.\n\n\"No, you first.\"\n\nBut in the midst of my words, he almost threw me into the doorway. I\nturned to pull him up after me. They were around his legs, and one had\njumped down upon his helmet. And he must have known it would happen.\n\n\"Go back to her,\" he cried, and slammed shut the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no time to help him, to interfere with the way of expiation he\nhad chosen. I tried to look away, but a sort of fascination kept me\nwatching him through the glass. He had been dragged to his knees. Then\nhe was up again, whirling to keep them away on all sides in a mad,\ngallant fight. But the creatures knew it was the kill. Now they were\naround his knees, now up to his waist in their overpowering mass. It was\nonly a matter of minutes.\n\nGarth took a staggering step backward, dragging them all with him. He\nwas facing me, and swung up his sword in the old Lunar salute. \"Good\nluck, Dunal.\" The words, coming clearly over the radio, had a note of\nexaltation.\n\nThen flashing his blade over his head, he hurled it into the midst of\nthe accursed things. With a tremendous effort, Garth tore the protecting\nhelmet from his head, and plunged backward over the cliff....\n\nThere was nothing to do but get in out of the lock and start for home,\nand little on the trip is worthy of recounting. Without unsurpassable\ndifficulty, I was able to operate the machinery and steer, first for\nBetelguese, then for the sun. Counting on the warning bells to arouse\nme, I managed to get in snatches of sleep at odd intervals. At times the\nstrain of the long watches was almost maddening.\n\nBy the time the midpoint had been passed, I was living in a sort of\nwaking dream; or rather, a state of somnambulism. I ate; my hands moved\nthe controls. And yet all the while my mind was wandering elsewhere--out\nto Garth's body under the blazing light of Rigel, back to the moon and\nKelvar, or else in an unreal, shadowy world of dreams and vague\nmemories.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith perfect mechanical accuracy I entered the solar system and adjusted\nthe projectors for the sun's attraction. Running slower and slower, I\nwatched Venus glide by. And then, gradually, everything faded, and I was\nwalking along the great Nardos bridge with Kelvar. The ocean was so\nstill that we could see mirrored in it the reflection of each white\ncolumn, and our own faces peering down, and beyond that the stars.\n\n\"I shall bring you a handful for your hair,\" I told her, and leaned over\nfarther, farther, reaching out.... Then I was falling, with Kelvar's\nface growing fainter, and in my ears a horrible ringing like the world\ncoming to an end.\n\nJust before I could strike the water, I wakened to find the alarm bell\njangling and the object-indicator light flashing away. Through the\ntelescope, the moon was large in the sky.\n\nIt was an hour, perhaps two, before I approached the sunlit surface and\nhovered over the shore by Nardos. Try as I would, my sleep-drugged body\ncould not handle the controls delicately enough to get the _Comet_ quite\nin step with the moon's rotation. Always a little too fast or too slow.\nI slid down until I was only ten or fifteen feet off the ground that\nseemed to be moving out from under me. In another minute I should be\nabove the water. I let everything go, and the _Comet_ fell. There was a\nthud, a sound of scraping over the sand, a list to one side. I thought\nfor an instant that the vessel was going to turn over, but with the\nweight of the reserve mercury in the fuel tanks it managed to right\nitself on a slope of ten or fifteen degrees.\n\nFrom the angle, I could barely see out the windows, and everything\nlooked strange. The water under the bridge seemed too low. The half-full\nEarth had greenish-black spots on it. And the sky?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo dead with sleep that I could scarcely move, I managed to crane my\nneck around to see better. There was no sky, only a faint gray haze\nthrough which the stars shone. And yet the sun must be shining. I\nstretched still further. There the sun burned, and around it was an\nunmistakable corona. It was like airless space.\n\nWas I dreaming again?\n\nWith a jerk, I got to my feet and climbed up the sloping floor to the\natmosphere tester. My fingers slipped off the stop-cock, then turned it.\nAnd the air-pressure needle scarcely moved. It was true. Somehow, as the\nscientists had always told us would be the case eventually, the air of\nthe moon, with so little gravity to hold it back, had evaporated into\nspace.\n\nBut in six months? It was unthinkable. Surely someone had survived the\ncatastrophe. Some people must have been able to keep themselves alive in\ncaves where the last of the atmosphere would linger. Kelvar _must_ be\nstill alive. I could find her and bring her to the _Comet_. We would go\nto some other world.\n\nFrantically, I pulled on my space-suit and clambered through the\nair-lock. I ran, until the cumbersome suit slowed me down to a\nstaggering walk through the sand beside the Oceanus Procellarum.\n\nLeaden and dull, the great sea lay undisturbed by the thin atmosphere\nstill remaining. It had shrunk by evaporation far away from its banks,\nand where the water once had been there was a dark incrustation of\nimpurities. On the land side, all was a great white plain of glittering\nalkali without a sign of vegetation. I went on toward Nardos the\nBeautiful.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven from afar off, I could see that it was desolate. Visible now that\nthe water had gone down, the pillars supporting it rose gaunt and\nskeletal. Towers had fallen in, and the gleaming white was dimmed. It\nwas a city of the dead, under an Earth leprous-looking with black spots\nwhere the clouds apparently had parted.\n\nI came nearer to Nardos and the bridge, nearer to the spot where I had\nlast seen Kelvar. Below the old water level, the columns showed a\ngreenish stain, and half-way out the whole structure had fallen in a\ngreat gap. I reached the land terminus of the span, still glorious and\nalmost beautiful in its ruins. Whole blocks of stone had fallen to the\nsand, and the adamantine pillars were cracked and crumbling with the\nerosion of ages.\n\nThen I knew.\n\nIn our argument as to the possible speed of the _Comet_, Garth and I had\nboth been right. In our reference frame, the vessel had put on an\nincredible velocity, and covered the nine-hundred-odd light-years around\nRigel in six months. But from the viewpoint of the moon, it had been\nunable to attain a velocity greater than that of light. As the\naccelerating energy pressed the vessel's speed closer and closer toward\nthat limiting velocity, the mass of the ship and of its contents had\nincreased toward infinity. And trying to move laboriously with such vast\nmass, our clocks and bodies had been slowed down until to our leaden\nminds a year of moon time became equivalent to several hours.\n\nThe _Comet_ had attained an average velocity of perhaps 175,000 miles\nper second, and the voyage that seemed to me six months had taken a\nthousand years. A thousand years! The words went ringing through my\nbrain. Kelvar had been dead for a thousand years. I was alone in a world\nuninhabited for centuries.\n\nI threw myself down and battered my head in the sand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMore to achieve, somehow, my own peace of mind, than in any hope of its\nbeing discovered, I have written this narrative. There are two copies,\nthis to be placed in a helio-beryllium box at the terminus of the\nbridge, the other within the comet[TN-3]. One at least should thus be\nable to escape the meteors which, unimpeded by the thin atmosphere, have\nbegun to strike everywhere, tearing up great craters in the explosion\nthat follows as a result of the impact.\n\nMy time is nearly up. Air is still plentiful on the _Comet_, but my\nprovisions will soon run short. It is now slightly over a month since I\ncollapsed on the sands into merciful sleep, and I possess food and water\nfor perhaps another. But why go on in my terrible loneliness?\n\nSometimes I waken from a dream in which they are all so near--Kelvar,\nGarth, all my old companions--and for a moment I cannot realize how far\naway they are. Beyond years and years. And I, trampling back and forth\nover the dust of our old life, staring across the waste, waiting--for\nwhat?\n\nNo, I shall wait only until the dark. When the sun drops over the\nGrimaldi plateau, I shall put my manuscripts in their safe places, then\ntear off my helmet and join the other two.\n\nAn hour ago, the bottom edge of the sun touched the horizon.\n\n  Transcriber's notes:\n    TN-1 Spaced em dash is found in the original.\n    TN-2 Corrected from litle to little.\n    TN-3 Not Capitalised or italicised in the original, but should\n         probably read _Comet_\n    TN-4 This etext was produced from \"Astounding Stories\" December\n         1931.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
