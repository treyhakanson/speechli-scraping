Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n[Sidenote: _Sextus Rollo Forsyte had his trouble with the bottle, but\nnothing out of a bottle ever produced such a hotel as the Mahoney-Plaza:\nonly 260 rooms ... only two guests to a room ... but accommodating 5200\nguests--all at the same time!... Floor please?_]\n\n\nAt last he was second in line. He squared his shoulders and pulled at\nthe lower edges of his black double-breasted suitcoat to erase the\ntravel wrinkles. The applicant ahead of him exploded the words, \"Nuts!\nI'll leave town first. I just _came_ from the Phony-Plaza. You can take\nthat squirrel-cage and--\"\n\n\"Next!\" the employment agent called sadly. Sextus Rollo Forsyte moved up\nand sat in the oak chair before the oak desk and faced the oak-featured\nman with the jobs.\n\n\"Forsyte is the name,\" Sextus reminded. The man riffled through the\napplication cards.\n\n\"Yes. Indeed. Lucky you came back. I have a fine position for you, Mr.\nForsyte. Right in your line.\" He held out a blue slip. \"The general\nmanager's position is open at the Mahoney-Plaza. Six hundred a month,\nboard and room. Now if you will....\"\n\nSextus staggered from the employment office stunned.\n\nHe could handle the job, all right. As he'd said on the application\nform, in his forty years he had managed half a dozen large hotels. But\nthey were handing him this plum without comment on his failure to fill\nin the spaces marked: COMPLETE REFERENCES (names and addresses).\n\nHe shrugged. They did a lot of things different in California. The most\nhe had hoped for was a waiter's job or maybe a short order cook in a fry\njoint. But if they wanted to ignore the hotel associations' black list,\nhe wouldn't argue.\n\nSextus Forsyte craved anonymity with the passion that most men seek fame\nand glory. Beneath his suave, mature exterior beat the shrinking heart\nof a perennial hermit whose delight was an adventure book and a bottle\nof whiskey.\n\nHis recent employer had not objected to his fondness for reading nor\nsolitude, but his appetite for liquor had revealed itself in a series of\nunfortunate crises which plague the life of any hotel executive.\n\nYes, Sextus Forsyte had sought his solitude in that remotest of all\nplaces, the large city hotel. His career of smiling at strange faces,\nwelcoming famous people and snapping crisp commands to assistant\nmanagers had provided the near-perfect isolation from normal society. To\nthe transient eye he was the poised, gregarious greeter. Actually he\nlived in a deep well of introversion. Of course, this was no affair of\nthe succession of boards of directors who had uttered the harsh charges\nof \"dipsomania\" and fired him. But then boards of directors are never\nnotable for their sympathy or understanding.\n\nAnd finally word got around the eastern seaboard about Sextus. \"A\ncompetent man, yes. Drinks on the job. Wouldn't have him as a busboy.\"\n\nWorse than the mere prospect of unemployment was the notoriety. Coldly\nsober, Sextus had fled panic-stricken to the west coast, vaguely\ndetermined to become a beach-comber or an oyster-fisherman or whatever\nthey did out there.\n\nHe stared now at the blue slip and turned in to a florist shop. He broke\nhis last five-dollar bill to buy a pink carnation for his buttonhole\nthen headed down the sunny walk to the hotel. It was a fine December\nmorning in the little beach town, such as only Florida and California\ncan advertise. He breathed the salt air and turned an appreciative ear\nto the gentle wash of the Pacific surf. He felt so good he might even\ntake a little breakfast before his first drink of whiskey of the day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the bus depot he traded his baggage checks for two old, but fine\nleather, two-suiters. Then he taxied the remaining two blocks to the\nMahoney-Plaza.\n\nHe paused at the entrance, stepped from under the marquis and looked up\nmystified. The frontage indicated a rather small hostelry to pay such\nmunificent salary to its general manager. Only five stories high, it was\nsqueezed in by low office buildings on either side like an ancient,\nnarrow-chested old man.\n\nHe handed his bags to a bell-hop and stepped into a spacious lobby. It\nwas decorated with fine furniture, thick carpets and throngs of\nexpensively undressed people.\n\nThe boy put his bags down before a remarkably long room-desk manned by\nthree white-suited clerks, but Sextus touched his arm. \"Just take them\nup to the manager's suite, please.\" The boy eyed him from carnation to\ndusty shoes.\n\n\"Right off a park bench. It figures, though.\" He got a key from the desk\nclerk, picked up the bags again and they started for the elevator\nalcove.\n\nSextus' practiced eye vacuumed details from the lobby, the well-swept\ncarpets, freshly emptied sand-jars and the modern elevators. The place\nseemed well-ordered and enjoying convention-magnitude business.\n\nHe started into the first elevator, but the operator warned, \"To Wing\n'A' only!\" with such a question in his voice that Sextus looked back for\nhis bellman. That person, a sandy-haired stripling of some\nfive-feet-four, was trying to wave him on with his head.\n\n\"Not that one,\" he said impatiently. \"Over here. Wing 'H'.\" Then Sextus\nnoticed there were five elevators on either side of the alcove. Each was\nplainly marked with a letter, running from \"A\" through \"J\". This was a\nnew wrinkle. Elevators were a mode of strictly vertical transportation,\nmeaning, as a safe generality, that they travelled in parallel routes.\nWhy, then, differentiate for separate wings when they were all grouped\ntogether in the first place?\n\nAnd, incidentally, why _ten_ elevators for a 200 or so room hotel,\nanyway?\n\nThey rode to the fourth floor in one-level leaps, stopping to unload\nseveral guests on each floor. The upper floor hall was of modest length,\nrunning fore and aft of the long, narrow building, as he had first sized\nit up. Where were all the _wings_--the wings with the separate\nelevators?\n\nThe boy let him into the light, airy apartment, dropped his bags in the\nmiddle of the floor and started out abruptly. Sextus called him back.\n\n\"Yeah, what'll it be--Chief?\" His voice was derisive.\n\n\"How many rooms do we have here, fellow?\"\n\n\"Twenny-six hunnerd and all full for the season, so if you'll just leggo\nof me--\"\n\n\"Don't you enjoy your work here?\"\n\n\"I detest it. Go ahead, fire me, chum. I'm lookin' for an excuse to\nclear out.\"\n\n\"Very well, you have one. Check out with the captain.\" Sextus couldn't\ntolerate discourteous familiarity. Friendly familiarity was bad enough,\nbut the \"chum\" did it.\n\nThe boy banged the door behind him.\n\nSextus opened his bag. From it he extracted a fifth of whiskey which he\ntook to the tiled bathroom. He stripped the cellophane from a drinking\nglass, poured it half-full of the amber liquor and drained it.\n\nHe was in the shower when the phone rang. He dripped to the night stand\nwith the patience of one who has soaked many a rug and discovered that\nthey don't stain. \"Forsyte here!\" he answered.\n\n\"The new manager? Well, this is Jackson, bell-captain. Whadda you mean\ncanning Jerry? I'm down to twelve skippers and you start out by firing\none of my fastest boys!\"\n\n\"The boy was sarcastic and insolent. Take it up with the service\nmanager. Anyway, how many bellmen do you need to run this cracker-box?\nTwelve is about eight too many.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence, then: \"In the first place _I am_ your service\nmanager, or all you got at the present. In the second damned place, you\ntell me where I can lay my hands on ten more boys before you go canning\nany more. I'm rehiring Jerry as of now!\" He banged the receiver in\nSextus' ear.\n\nUnperturbed, Sextus finished his shower, dressed in a lighter weight\nsuit and picked up the phone. The house switchboard apparently was\njammed. It took a full minute to get an operator. \"Forsyte here. Your\nnew manager, that is. Instruct all department heads to be in my office\nin seven minutes. General conference.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother short nip at the bottle served nicely to quiet a small hunger\npang. He went in search of his office. He found it on the mezzanine,\nsuitably lavish, clean and well-furnished.\n\nHe adjusted the fragrant carnation on his lapel in the large wall\nmirror, not entirely displeased with what it reflected. Except for the\nsuitcase wrinkles in his morning coat, he should pass inspection. His\nthinning hair, square jaw and wide-set eyes radiated a quiet dignity.\nThe slight pink of his cheeks and nose was a bit more prominent than he\nliked. He should have had some breakfast.\n\nThe phone rang and he let it. He was not yet ready to assume his duties.\nBut as time passed and none of his staff appeared, the ring became more\nsignificant. He gave in.\n\n\"Forsyte here!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Mr. Forsyte,\" it was the operator, \"but none of your staff can\njoin you just now. They send their regrets.\"\n\n\"Regrets?\" Sextus said icily. \"Did you explain who called this meeting,\nyoung lady?\"\n\nHer voice dropped the synthetic sweetness and became a throaty rasp.\n\"Look, Buster, we're short-handed enough without you should call\nmeetings at eleven A. M. Plug the hole in your head. It's suckin' air.\"\nHe broke the connection. The place was busy, he'd grant, but this was\nrank insubordination. His whole staff! Everyone seemed keyed to the\n_boingg!_ point.\n\nHe decided to mull it over breakfast. The spacious, well-appointed\ncoffee-shop served his juice gelid and his coffee hot, his egg tender\nand his toast crisp. The bit of tension vanished as he ate with relish.\nHe signed the check with his tight, little introverted signature.\n\nNow for a quick inspection tour to see just how rough things really\nwere. He told the boy on the service elevator, \"To the bottom.\" His\nstomach writhed as the cage plummeted four floors below the street\nlevel. The kitchens, laundry, warehouse, baggage-room, switchboard room,\nice-plant and personnel spaces sprawled through an acre of underground\nlevels. They boiled with sweating men and dishevelled women engaged in\nthe intricate business of housing, feeding, clothing, liquoring and\ncatering to a small city under one roof. Then he remembered how small\nthe quarters were upstairs.\n\nHow could they _house_ enough guests to justify all this?\n\nReturning to his office he called the employment bureau. \"Mr. Crowson?\nForsyte here! I'm at the hotel.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, what's wrong now?\"\n\n\"You didn't tell me to whom I should report. This, ah, is my first\nexperience with employment agencies. Usually there is a board of\ndirectors.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" Crowson sighed audibly. \"You are in full charge, I assure\nyou. Our little interview was quite satisfactory. I have certified you\nto your bookkeeping department, and you may draw upon your salary after\na week. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Where may I reach the owner or the chairman in an emergency?\"\n\n\"The owner is a Dr. Bradford who is in Hanford, Washington. Top secret\ngovernment work. He may not be contacted until he returns. Sorry, that's\nall I can tell you. Getting on all right, Mr. Forsyte?\" he asked with\nobvious reluctance.\n\nSextus cut off. Two lights on the intercom were blinking at him. One\ncall was from the kitchen. The first chef had just heaved a cleaver at\nthe steward, and the head salad girl was in hysterics.\n\nSextus said he'd be right down. The second call was from the chief\nhouse-detective. He had caught a bell-hop peddling marijuana to the\nwaitresses. What was the manager's new policy? Sextus told him to hold\nthe boy in the locker room for him. Then one of the room clerks rang to\nsay that Gary Gable, the movie star, was raising hell in the lobby\nbecause he couldn't get the bridal suite and demanded to see the\nmanager.\n\nSextus smiled. These things were the routine of running a large hotel.\nHe stopped at the bar for a quick one and then started for the kitchen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe day passed pleasantly enough, and he looked forward to retiring to\nhis quiet rooms upstairs. He thought to get some intelligent answers\nfrom his assistant manager when he walked in promptly at five P. M., but\nhe turned out to be a university student from Southern Cal, working days\non his master's degree in business administration and nights at the\nhotel. No wonder he hadn't been promoted. Not that he wasn't\nbright--just not experienced.\n\nSextus formally offered his hand and introduced himself. The lad said,\n\"I'm Horace Smith the phone is ringing excuse me.\" He snatched the phone\nwith a harried look.\n\nSomehow the phone never stopped ringing. Sextus gave up and retired to\ndress for dinner. He finished his fifth of whiskey and descended to the\nhotel's swank Oceania Room, where he made himself known to the maitre\nd'hotel. That frenzied little moustachioed person sniffed Sextus' breath\nand seated him behind a potted palm.\n\nDiscreetly avoiding the wine list, Sextus dined well, noting several\nmovie stars and other vip's in the crowded dining room. He couldn't\nescape the illusion that he was dining at the Ambassador or the Waldorf\nAstoria--instead of in a five-story rat-trap. Where did they all come\nfrom?\n\nAs he awaited the elevator, he was approached by the bell-captain. \"Mr.\nForsyte?\" Sextus nodded stiffly. \"Here's an envelope Mr. Patterson left\nfor you. He was the last G. M. Incidentally, sorry I was a little rough\non the phone, but you can see our situation here. Understaffed and\novercrowded. It gets thick, real thick, brother.\"\n\nSextus felt his belly muscles tighten. \"Confusion is never improved by\ndiscourtesy or insubordination,\" he said coldly.\n\nAt that moment a bellman rushed up to the rebuffed captain who was\nregarding Sextus with a restrained loathing. \"The guy in C332 keeps\nscreaming for his beer, but the service elevator to 'C' vector keeps\ndumping me off in 'F'.\"\n\nThe captain said, \"Try riding to fourth on 'C' and then walk down a deck\nand come out through the linen room.\"\n\n\"Can't I just ride up the guest elevator, Jack?\"\n\nThe captain stared at Sextus. \"Our Mr. Forsyte wouldn't approve. Now,\nmove!\"\n\nHe turned to Sextus and said acidly, \"Just one of our little extra\nproblems.\" He moved off with a disgusted shake of his carefully barbered\nhead.\n\nThe nature of the bell-captain's special problem sounded interesting,\nbut the details confused Sextus. _Ride to four on \"C\", walk down to\nthree and out by the linen closet._ Sounded like three-dimensional\nchess.\n\nHis cage arrived and he returned to his suite. He removed his shoes,\nstripped to the waist and sank gratefully into the soft bed, nestling\nthe last bottle of his suitcase reserve in the crook of his bare arm.\n\nHe considered the sealed envelope marked: TO MY SUCCESSOR. URGENT\nMATTERS.\n\nFirst he opened a fresh bottle and then the envelope. He flipped through\nthe papers. There were some tax reports ready for signature, two union\ncontracts up for renegotiation and an estimate on re-doing 520 rooms in\nvectors \"B\" and \"F\". Vectors? Did they mean \"Wings\"?\n\nThe last paper was a personal letter, apparently addressed to him.\nBefore he could begin it the phone at his bedside jangled. Operator\nsaid, \"Would you take this, please, Mr. Forsyte? I dispatched a house\nman, but the guest is hysterical.\"\n\nWithout awaiting his permission she cut in the woman. \"Hello, manager?\nThere's a man in my bed!\"\n\n\"What is your room number, madame?\" Sextus asked with drowsy detachment.\n\n\"I'm in H-408,\" she said, and on the \"8\" her voice ran up the scale in a\nquivering crescendo that launched Sextus briskly from his bed. H-408 was\nhis floor and his wing, luckily. He tore out of the suite and down the\nhall without shirt or shoes.\n\nThe door stood ajar, and he pushed it open. In the middle of the floor,\nstill gabbling into the phone, stood a lumpy, pallid woman about his own\nage, naked except for a pillow which she hugged fiercely to her navel.\nHer bleached hair was a frayed bird's-nest.\n\nIn bed, decently clad in a pair of blue and white striped pajamas, was a\nrather distinguished, gray-haired gentleman of about fifty, leaning on\none elbow and watching the woman with an expression of mild astonishment\nand interest. To Sextus' practiced eye, the man was guilty of nothing.\n\nThe house detective arrived at that moment, but Sextus dismissed him\nwith a wave of his hand. He went in alone.\n\n\"I'm the manager, madam,\" he assured her. He noted that despite her\nexcited wails, her eyes drooped half shut. A bottle of sleeping pills on\nthe table was uncapped.\n\n\"Thizz man, thizz man, thizz man!\" she kept repeating and pointing her\nelbow at the bed. The man in question raised his eyebrows and shook his\nhead.\n\n\"Damndest sensation I ever felt,\" he said. \"I'm Johnathan P. Turner,\nattorney. Before I tell you my story, please check with the desk and\nverify that I was assigned this room.\"\n\nSextus took the phone from the woman's pudgy hand which darted to rescue\nthe sagging pillow. The room-clerk reported that Mr. J. P. Turner was\nregistered to room 408, but in \"J\" vector, not \"H\".\n\nSextus' eyes swept the room. It was an unexplainable mess. Two sets of\nluggage were jumbled on and around the baggage rack at the foot of the\nbed. Rinsed out nylons hung from the shower rod, but a man's shaving kit\noccupied the shelf over the lavatory. Despairing of ever arriving at a\nsensible explanation, Sextus went to work.\n\nAlthough hampered somewhat without his shirt, coat and tie, Sextus\nmanaged to get Turner and his belongings transferred peaceably to\nanother room and the woman quieted down in bed with another sleeping\npill.\n\nThen Turner was allowed to tell his story. \"I had turned in early and\nwas lying there on my back reading the paper when suddenly I got the\nmost messy feeling all through me. It was like--oh, hell, I can't say\nit. Anyhow, in just about a second, something went _thub!_--and there\nshe was in bed with me--naked!\" he added with a shiver.\n\nSextus grasped at a straw. \"How many did you have to drink this evening,\nMr. Turner?\"\n\nThe attorney squirmed uncomfortably. \"Well, quite a few, maybe, but not\nenough to--\"\n\nSextus shrugged one shoulder and turned to leave. \"Understand, we don't\nblame you a bit, sir. You know how these middle-aged women can carry on\nwhen they get out on the town. You must have dozed off before she\nslipped in.\"\n\n\"But my door was locked! I think,\" he added uncertainly.\n\n\"We won't breathe a word of it, Mr. Turner. Rest well!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSextus padded silently back to his room in his stocking feet and took a\nlong pull at the whiskey. Funny thing, this. People often got into the\nwrong hotel beds, but rarely with such impalpable excuses. He sighed and\npicked up the letter from his predecessor again. It read:\n\n     Welcome to the Phony-Plaza. (That name again.) You will be the\n     fifth manager in 30 days. If you need the job as much as I\n     thought I did you will probably ignore my advice, but here\n     goes, anyway: RESIGN! BAIL OUT! SKIDOO! (The man was emphatic.)\n     I can't tell you where they've got the 2600 rooms in this\n     haunted ant-hill, but believe me, they are there, and you'll be\n     sorry if you hang around long enough to prove it.\n\n     _My_ predecessor left a garbled note about some _hyperspace_\n     system that the owner, Dr. Bradford, has figured out. Actually,\n     there are only 260 rooms, as you've probably surmised. But this\n     Bradford, who is a nuclear physicist, by the way, has installed\n     some sort of field generator in each elevator shaft that gives\n     entry to these rooms at _ten different locations in time_. Room\n     500, for instance, in Vector A is 10 years from Vector B. So\n     when you run to capacity with, say, two people to the room, you\n     have 5200 guests in 260 rooms! They all live by the same\n     calendar, but in their rooms they are actually centuries apart.\n     How do you like those apples?\n\n     It's all quite neat and economical, what with the cost per\n     front foot of this beach area zoned for business, and you'll\n     find a dandy profit on the books, but start worrying, fellow!\n     Things are beginning to happen. The maintenance engineer, who,\n     incidentally, is quitting, too, says that the equipment in the\n     shafts is wearing out, and the fields are pulsating or decaying\n     or some damned thing. And we can't contact Dr. Bradford, who\n     took the service manual with him.\n\n     Maybe you are more experienced in this hotel business than I\n     am, but I couldn't stand the gaff. One more mess like I barely\n     managed to clean up this week and someone's going to the pokey.\n     It won't be me.\n\n     Good luck, if you insist on staying, but I warned you.\n\n     (signed) Thornton K. Patterson\n\n     P.S. The fire-marshall is on our necks because the windows are\n     all sealed, but for God's sake, DON'T UNSEAL THEM!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSextus tossed the fantastic communication aside in disgust, but his mind\nbegan to unreel a picture of the confusion he had witnessed down in the\nservice quarters: Bellboys and room-service waiters fighting for service\nelevators; chambermaids trundling their little carts on the dead run;\nthe overworked laundry staff, laboring in a veritable sweatshop of\nsteamy chaos, swamped in a billowing backlog of sheets and towels. It\nall pointed to a large hotel operation.\n\nIf so, where were the rooms? Refusing to argue further with himself, he\ngot undressed. Hyperspace or not, the people apparently were there, and\nit was his job to serve them. He got a bucket of ice from room-service,\nmixed an ice and whiskey highball and retreated into his private little\nworld between crisp sheets and the pages of a twenty-five-cent mystery\nnovel.\n\nArising early, he was girded for the summons from Miss Genevieve Hafner\nin room H-408. He went to her room. Fully dressed and in the daylight\nshe was still a hollow-eyed mess. The only visible improvement was in\nthe bleached bird's-nest, now a prim, rolled circle on her unlovely\npate.\n\n\"What amends,\" she demanded, \"do you intend to make for my terrible\nexperience last night? Is that horrid creature in jail?\"\n\n\"Experience? Jail?\" Sextus asked innocent-eyed. He asked that she tell\nhim about it. Exasperated, she went over the details. When she finished\nhe patted her hand and pointed to the sleeping pills. \"You should see\nyour doctor.\"\n\n\"But my doctor _prescribed_ those pills,\" she whimpered, looking down\nshyly at the hand which Sextus held gingerly. \"They never made me\ndream--before.\"\n\nHe bent and kissed the revolting hand. \"You are much too lovely a lady\nto have escaped from such a predicament as you describe without\nsuffering--shall we say, a more romantic--fate?\"\n\nMiss Hafner blushed at the thought and wavered between outrage and\necstasy for a dangerous moment. With time-tested genius, Sextus withdrew\nquietly and left her to her thoughts.\n\nHe _must_ get in touch with Dr. Bradford, atom business or not. This\nplace could blow sky-high any minute.\n\nHe slipped the key into his own door and entered his suite. He took two\nbrisk strides into his bedroom, tripped over a lady's overnight case and\nsprawled into his unmade bed. Even as he landed he realized it had an\noccupant, a gorgeous, strangely familiar blonde creature, touselled and\nasleep hugging her pillow with a creamy arm. A crash from the bathroom\nbrought his head bouncing off the silken coverlet even as the girl\nawakened with a scream and tangled them both with the bed clothes.\n\nGary Gable charged from the bathroom, face dripping and a tuft of lather\nunder each ear. \"What in the Goddam hell--\" He leaped for Sextus with\nhis internationally famous shoulders knotted into bunches of muscular\nmenace.\n\n\"I'm the hotel manager,\" Sextus blurted loudly. For once his\nself-assurance wavered under fire. Even to himself his words explained\nnothing.\n\nMeanwhile, Gable tripped over one of Sextus' heavy suitcases and joined\nthe pair in bed. Another male voice issued from the bathroom, and as\nthey all thrashed about, Sextus became aware that a second female had\nsomehow appeared between Gable and his brand new bride. They came up\ntogether, face to face, the beautiful, sleepy blonde and the very\nwide-awake, queenly brunette. Now a pot-bellied little man in shorts and\nundershirt emerged from the bathroom, his mouth a gaping hole in a fully\nlathered face.\n\nSextus wriggled free, made for the door and off down the hall. To his\nhorror, the automatic signal light on the vector \"H\" elevator was\nflickering and fading. The whole H-vector must be collapsing. He dashed\nfor the stairwell and then reconsidered. He moved to the end of the hall\nwhich overlooked the low roof of the adjacent building. He tried the\nwindow and remembered that it was sealed. Back in the alcove he seized\none of the sand jars and headed back for the window. A growing tide of\ncommotion swelled from behind almost every door now. Grunts, screams and\nwrestling sounds came over the transoms.\n\nHe dashed the sand jar through the window, chipped off the jagged edges\nwith his heel and climbed out. It was a twenty-foot drop to security,\nand he made it without hesitation. What could a man hope to do with a\nmess like--\n\nSpang! His feet struck, not with a crunch on gravelled tar, but into a\nspringy fabric that sagged under his 180 pounds, tossed him six feet in\nthe air, caught him on the rebound and then juggled him down with\ndiminishing bounces.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were waiting for him, as he regained his feet on the quivering\nsurface of a spring-loaded, canvas trampoline. The bright, mid-morning\nsun blinded him for an instant, but their voices assailed his ears in a\nmighty roar of approval as he squinted under his hand and peered around\nhim.\n\n\"Attaboy, Sexy,\" a shrill female voice piped. The roof-top was jammed\nwith a pressing throng of--nearly naked people. In the cleared\nsemi-circle about him a cordon of male bodies-beautiful restrained the\nmob behind a rope from which a long streamer hung with letters reading:\n\n     \"WELCOME, SEXTUS, TO 2153 A. D.\"\n\nReaching over the edge of the canvas platform with outstretched hand was\na single, willowy, sun-baked oldster in a purple loin-cloth. His hair\nand beard were a dazzling white, and his face was wreathed in a silly\nsmile, the kind officials always wear when presenting the keys to the\ncity.\n\nHe shuffled his white kid sandals and spoke with an accent: \"Welcome to\n2153, Sextus Rollo Forsyte! California salutes you!\"\n\nSomewhere down on the street a raucous brass band broke into the _Stars\nand Stripes Forever_ that quickly medlied into _California, Here We\nCome_!\n\nSextus shrank back against the wall and felt ancient bricks crumble into\ndust against his hands. The magnitude of his disaster crushed in upon\nshrinking soul, and as his nimble imagination grasped the stunning\nsignificance every molecule of his being vibrated with horror. _He had\nbeen warned not to open a window._\n\n\"You have fulfilled the legend,\" the old man sang joyously. \"You are a\nfamous man.\" How famous, Sextus was forced to acknowledge as a\ntelevision boom snaked over the heads of the crowd trailing a wisp of\ncable and cast its baleful, glassy eye full into his face.\n\n\"Two hundred years to the day, as my great-great-grandfather predicted.\nI am Clark Bradford, direct descendent of--\"\n\nSextus stared wildly up at the open window. He bounced once\nexperimentally. It was a fine trampoline, and he flipped a foot off the\nsurface. Next bounce he flexed his knees a little and gained another\nfoot. Now he doubled up purposefully.\n\nThe one-man-delegate in purple frowned. \"Stop that. We are here to\nwelcome you and start the celebration at the Hollywood Bowl and--Stop\nthat, I say!\" Now he sensed Sextus' incredible intent. \"Officer, help\nout here, please!\"\n\nA bulgy, bronzed fellow clad mainly in an immaculately white brassard\nleft the rope barrier and joined Bradford.\n\nThe Elder screamed, \"You can't go back, Forsyte! Don't you understand?\nYou disappeared two centuries ago when the vector field collapsed. You\ncan't go back! You can't! This is your destiny!\"\n\nSextus' heels soared five feet above the canvas and gained precious\naltitude with each spring, but it was a precarious business the higher\nhe went. One slip and he'd glance off at a tangent and be captured by\nthose reaching, grasping obscene hands in the crowd. The thought almost\nunseated his reason.\n\nThe police officer asked Bradford, \"What would happen if he did go\nback?\" Then he added, \"Ain't he got a right to?\"\n\nBradford shuffled nervously. \"I don't quite know. We never considered\nsuch a--my God! Stop, man, stop. You'll change the whole course of\nhistory! Stop him!\"\n\nThe barelegged minion tried, but as he climbed up on the edge of the\ntrampoline Sextus bounced and kicked out with accuracy and\ndetermination. The policeman sprawled back clutching air, and the crowd\nroared.\n\nOne more bounce and a half twist, now. Sextus soared up, up, and his\nhands touched the sill.\n\nWith the agility of desperation he clawed up and through the paneless\nwindow.\n\n\"You don't know what you are doing,\" the old man screeched. \"Stay here\nand you'll be famous. If you go back it is to oblivion. Oblivion! Very,\nwell, _go_ back! _Go_ back, you--you nonentity!\"\n\n\"You bet,\" Sextus panted to himself and tumbled onto the carpeted fourth\nfloor hallway of the Mahoney-Plaza hotel.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nInstantly, another voice, but without accent, accosted him shrilly from\ndown the hall. \"You, there. You mister manager.\" Sextus sighed mightily\nwith relief. It was only Miss Genevieve Hafner holding a pimply-faced,\nred-haired youth by the ear.\n\nTrue, Gary Gable and two hair-pulling, female starlets bore down right\nbehind her, and rooms along both sides of the corridor were disgorging\neddies of indignant displaced persons.\n\nBut these were things he understood. These were just beefs. Somewhat\nmore involved than usual, but nothing much worse than a full-fledged\nconvention at mid-night.\n\nHe adjusted his mashed carnation, brushed the crumbles of old brick dust\nfrom his morning coat and moved into the fray.\n\n\"Now, now, Miss Hafner! _What_ are you up to _this_ time?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Forsyte's Retreat, by Winston Marks\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FORSYTE'S RETREAT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32735.txt or 32735.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/7/3/32735/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
