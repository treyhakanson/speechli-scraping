When two expanding empires meet ... war is\n     inevitable. Or is it ...?_\n\n\nAt 04 hours 10 minutes, ship time, the _Niccola_ was well inside the\nTheta Gisol solar system. She had previously secured excellent evidence\nthat this was not the home of the Plumie civilization. There was no tuned\nradiation. There was no evidence of interplanetary travel--rockets would\nbe more than obvious, and a magnetronic drive had a highly characteristic\nradiation-pattern--so the real purpose of the _Niccola's_ voyage would\nnot be accomplished here. She wouldn't find out where Plumies came from.\n\nThere might, though, be one or more of those singular, conical,\nhollow-topped cairns sheltering silicon-bronze plates, which constituted\nthe evidence that Plumies existed. The _Niccola_ went sunward toward the\ninner planets to see. Such cairns had been found on conspicuous landmarks\non oxygen-type planets over a range of some twelve hundred light-years.\nBy the vegetation about them, some were a century old. On the same\nevidence, others had been erected only months or weeks or even days\nbefore a human Space Survey ship arrived to discover them. And the\nsituation was unpromising. It wasn't likely that the galaxy was big\nenough to hold two races of rational beings capable of space travel. Back\non ancient Earth, a planet had been too small to hold two races with\ntools and fire. Historically, that problem was settled when _Homo\nsapiens_ exterminated _Homo neanderthalis_. It appeared that the same\nsituation had arisen in space. There were humans, and there were Plumies.\nBoth had interstellar ships. To humans, the fact was alarming. The need\nfor knowledge, and the danger that Plumies might know more first, and\nthereby be able to exterminate humanity, was appalling.\n\nTherefore the _Niccola_. She drove on sunward. She had left one frozen\nouter planet far behind. She had crossed the orbits of three others. The\nlast of these was a gas giant with innumerable moonlets revolving about\nit. It was now some thirty millions of miles back and twenty to one side.\nThe sun, ahead, flared and flamed in emptiness against that expanse of\ntinted stars.\n\nJon Baird worked steadily in the _Niccola's_ radar room. He was one of\nthose who hoped that the Plumies would not prove to be the natural\nenemies of mankind. Now, it looked like this ship wouldn't find out in\nthis solar system. There were plenty of other ships on the hunt. From\nhere on, it looked like routine to the next unvisited family of planets.\nBut meanwhile he worked. Opposite him, Diane Holt worked as steadily, her\ndark head bent intently over a radar graph in formation. The immediate\njob was the completion of a map of the meteor swarms following cometary\norbits about this sun. They interlaced emptiness with hazards to\nnavigation, and nobody would try to drive through a solar system without\nsuch a map.\n\nElsewhere in the ship, everything was normal. The engine room was a place\nof stillness and peace, save for the almost inaudible hum of the drive,\nrunning at half a million Gauss flux-density. The skipper did whatever\nskippers do when they are invisible to their subordinates. The weapons\nofficer, Taine, thought appropriate thoughts. In the navigation room the\nsecond officer conscientiously glanced at each separate instrument at\nleast once in each five minutes, and then carefully surveyed all the\nscreens showing space outside the ship. The stewards disposed of the\ndebris of the last meal, and began to get ready for the next. In the\ncrew's quarters, those off duty read or worked at scrimshaw, or simply\nand contentedly loafed.\n\nDiane handed over the transparent radar graph, to be fitted into the\nthree-dimensional map in the making.\n\n\"There's a lump of stuff here,\" she said interestedly. \"It could be the\ncomet that once followed this orbit, now so old it's lost all its gases\nand isn't a comet any longer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this instant, which was 04 hours 25 minutes ship time, the alarm-bell\nrang. It clanged stridently over Baird's head, repeater-gongs sounded all\nthrough the ship, and there was a scurrying and a closing of doors. The\nalarm gong could mean only one thing. It made one's breath come faster or\none's hair stand on end, according to temperament.\n\nThe skipper's face appeared on the direct-line screen from the navigation\nroom.\n\n\"_Plumies?_\" he demanded harshly. \"_Mr. Baird! Plumies?_\"\n\nBaird's hands were already flipping switches and plugging the radar room\napparatus into a new setup.\n\n\"There's a contact, sir,\" he said curtly. \"No. There was a contact. It's\nbroken now. Something detected us. We picked up a radar pulse. One.\"\n\nThe word \"one\" meant much. A radar system that could get adequate\ninformation from a single pulse was not the work of amateurs. It was the\nproduct of a very highly developed technology. Setting all equipment to\nfull-globular scanning, Baird felt a certain crawling sensation at the\nback of his neck. He'd been mapping within a narrow range above and below\nthe line of this system's ecliptic. A lot could have happened outside the\narea he'd had under long-distance scanning.\n\nBut seconds passed. They seemed like years. The all-globe scanning\ncovered every direction out from the _Niccola_. Nothing appeared which\nhad not been reported before. The gas-giant planet far behind, and the\nonly inner one on this side of the sun, would return their pulses only\nafter minutes. Meanwhile the radars reported very faintfully, but they\nonly repeated previous reports.\n\n\"No new object within half a million miles,\" said Baird, after a suitable\ninterval. Presently he added: \"Nothing new within three-quarter million\nmiles.\" Then: \"Nothing new within a million miles ...\"\n\nThe skipper said bitingly:\n\n\"_Then you'd better check on objects that are not new!_\" He turned aside,\nand his voice came more faintly as he spoke into another microphone.\n\"_Mr. Taine! Arm all rockets and have your tube crews stand by in combat\nreadiness! Engine room! Prepare drive for emergency maneuvers!\nDamage-control parties, put on pressure suits and take combat posts with\nequipment!_\" His voice rose again in volume. \"_Mr. Baird! How about\nobserved objects?_\"\n\nDiane murmured. Baird said briefly:\n\n\"Only one suspicious object, sir--and that shouldn't be suspicious. We\nare sending an information-beam at something we'd classed as a burned-out\ncomet. Pulse going out now, sir.\"\n\nDiane had the distant-information transmitter aimed at what she'd said\nmight be a dead comet. Baird pressed the button. An extraordinary complex\nof information-seeking frequencies and forms sprang into being and leaped\nacross emptiness. There were microwaves of strictly standard amplitude,\nfor measurement-standards. There were frequencies of other values, which\nwould be selectively absorbed by this material and that. There were\nlaterally and circularly polarized beams. When they bounced back, they\nwould bring a surprising amount of information.\n\nThey returned. They did bring back news. The thing that had registered as\na larger lump in a meteor-swarm was not a meteor at all. It returned four\ndifferent frequencies with a relative-intensity pattern which said that\nthey'd been reflected by bronze--probably silicon bronze. The polarized\nbeams came back depolarized, of course, but with phase-changes which said\nthe reflector had a rounded, regular form. There was a smooth hull of\nsilicon bronze out yonder. There was other data.\n\n\"It will be a Plumie ship, sir,\" said Baird very steadily. \"At a guess,\nthey picked up our mapping beam and shot a single pulse at us to find out\nwho and what we were. For another guess, by now they've picked up and\nanalyzed our information-beam and know what we've found out about them.\"\n\nThe skipper scowled.\n\n\"_How many of them?_\" he demanded. \"_Have we run into a fleet?_\"\n\n\"I'll check, sir,\" said Baird. \"We picked up no tuned radiation from\nouter space, sir, but it could be that they picked us up when we came out\nof overdrive and stopped all their transmissions until they had us in a\ntrap.\"\n\n\"_Find out how many there are!_\" barked the skipper. \"_Make it quick!\nReport additional data instantly!_\"\n\nHis screen clicked off. Diane, more than a little pale, worked swiftly to\nplug the radar-room equipment into a highly specialized pattern. The\n_Niccola_ was very well equipped, radar-wise. She'd been a type G8 Survey\nship, and on her last stay in port she'd been rebuilt especially to hunt\nfor and make contact with Plumies. Since the discovery of their\nexistence, that was the most urgent business of the Space Survey. It\nmight well be the most important business of the human race--on which its\nsurvival or destruction would depend. Other remodeled ships had gone out\nbefore the _Niccola_, and others would follow until the problem was\nsolved. Meanwhile the _Niccola's_ twenty-four rocket tubes and\nstepped-up drive and computer-type radar system equipped her for\nPlumie-hunting as well as any human ship could be. Still, if she'd been\nlured deep into the home system of the Plumies, the prospects were not\ngood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe new setup began its operation, instantly the last contact closed. The\nthree-dimensional map served as a matrix to control it. The\ninformation-beam projector swung and flung out its bundle of\noscillations. It swung and flashed, and swung and flashed. It had to\nexamine every relatively nearby object for a constitution of silicon\nbronze and a rounded shape. The nearest objects had to be examined first.\nSpeed was essential. But three-dimensional scanning takes time, even at\nsome hundreds of pulses per minute.\n\nNevertheless, the information came in. No other silicon-bronze object\nwithin a quarter-million miles. Within half a million. A million. A\nmillion and a half. Two million ...\n\nBaird called the navigation room.\n\n\"Looks like a single Plumie ship, sir,\" he reported. \"At least there's\none ship which is nearest by a very long way.\"\n\n\"_Hah!_\" grunted the skipper. \"_Then we'll pay him a visit. Keep an open\nline, Mr. Baird!_\" His voice changed. \"_Mr. Taine! Report here at once to\nplan tactics!_\"\n\nBaird shook his head, to himself. The _Niccola's_ orders were to make\ncontact without discovery, if such a thing were possible. The ideal would\nbe a Plumie ship or the Plumie civilization itself, located and subject\nto complete and overwhelming envelopment by human ships--before the\nPlumies knew they'd been discovered. And this would be the human ideal\nbecause humans have always had to consider that a stranger might be\nhostile, until he'd proven otherwise.\n\nSuch a viewpoint would not be optimism, but caution. Yet caution was\nnecessary. It was because the Survey brass felt the need to prepare for\nevery unfavorable eventuality that Taine had been chosen as weapons\nofficer of the _Niccola_. His choice had been deliberate, because he was\na xenophobe. He had been a problem personality all his life. He had a\nseemingly congenital fear and hatred of strangers--which in mild cases is\ncommon enough, but Taine could not be cured without a complete breakdown\nof personality. He could not serve on a ship with a multiracial crew,\nbecause he was invincibly suspicious of and hostile to all but his own\nsmall breed. Yet he seemed ideal for weapons officer on the _Niccola_,\nprovided he never commanded the ship. Because _if_ the Plumies were\nhostile, a well-adjusted, normal man would never think as much like them\nas a Taine. He was capable of the kind of thinking Plumies might\npractice, if they were xenophobes themselves.\n\nBut to Baird, so extreme a precaution as a known psychopathic condition\nin an officer was less than wholly justified. It was by no means certain\nthat the Plumies would instinctively be hostile. Suspicious, yes.\nCautious, certainly. But the only fact known about the Plumie\ncivilization came from the cairns and silicon-bronze inscribed tablets\nthey'd left on oxygen-type worlds over a twelve-hundred-light-year range\nin space, and the only thing to be deduced about the Plumies themselves\ncame from the decorative, formalized symbols like feathery plumes which\nwere found on all their bronze tablets. The name \"Plumies\" came from that\nsymbol.\n\nNow, though, Taine was called to the navigation room to confer on\ntactics. The _Niccola_ swerved and drove toward the object Baird\nidentified as a Plumie ship. This was at 05 hours 10 minutes ship time.\nThe human ship had a definite velocity sunward, of course. The Plumie\nship had been concealed by the meteor swarm of a totally unknown comet.\nIt was an excellent way to avoid observation. On the other hand, the\n_Niccola_ had been mapping, which was bound to attract attention. Now\neach ship knew of the other's existence. Since the _Niccola_ had been\ndetected, she had to carry out orders and attempt a contact to gather\ninformation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBaird verified that the _Niccola's_ course was exact for interception at\nher full-drive speed. He said in a flat voice:\n\n\"I wonder how the Plumies will interpret this change of course? They know\nwe're aware they're not a meteorite. But charging at them without even\ntrying to communicate could look ominous. We could be stupid, or too\narrogant to think of anything but a fight.\" He pressed the skipper's call\nand said evenly: \"Sir, I request permission to attempt to communicate\nwith the Plumie ship. We're ordered to try to make friends if we know\nwe've been spotted.\"\n\nTaine had evidently just reached the navigation room. His voice snapped\nfrom the speaker:\n\n\"_I advise against that, sir! No use letting them guess our level of\ntechnology!_\"\n\nBaird said coldly:\n\n\"They've a good idea already. We beamed them for data.\"\n\nThere was silence, with only the very faint humming sound which was\nnatural in the ship in motion. It would be deadly to the nerves if there\nwere absolute silence. The skipper grumbled:\n\n\"_Requests and advice! Dammit! Mr. Baird, you might wait for orders! But\nI was about to ask you to try to make contact through signals. Do so._\"\n\nHis speaker clicked off. Baird said:\n\n\"It's in our laps. Diane. And yet we have to follow orders. Send the\nfirst roll.\"\n\nDiane had a tape threaded into a transmitter. It began to unroll through\na pickup head. She put on headphones. The tape began to transmit toward\nthe Plumie. Back at base it had been reasoned that a pattern of\nclickings, plainly artificial and plainly stating facts known to both\nraces, would be the most reasonable way to attempt to open contact. The\ntape sent a series of cardinal numbers--one to five. Then an addition\ntable, from one plus one to five plus five. Then a multiplication table\nup to five times five. It was not startlingly intellectual information to\nbe sent out in tiny clicks ranging up and down the radio spectrum. But it\nwas orders.\n\nBaird sat with compressed lips. Diane listened for a repetition of any of\nthe transmitted signals, sent back by the Plumie. The speakers about the\nradar room murmured the orders given through all the ship. Radar had to\nbe informed of all orders and activity, so it could check their results\noutside the ship. So Baird heard the orders for the engine room to be\nsealed up and the duty-force to get into pressure suits, in case the\n_Niccola_ fought and was hulled. Damage-control parties reported\nthemselves on post, in suits, with equipment ready. Then Taine's voice\nsnapped: \"_Rocket crews, arm even-numbered rockets with chemical\nexplosive warheads. Leave odd-numbered rockets armed with atomics. Report\nback!_\"\n\nDiane strained her ears for possible re-transmission of the _Niccola's_\nsignals, which would indicate the Plumie's willingness to try\nconversation. But she suddenly raised her hand and pointed to the\nradar-graph instrument. It repeated the positioning of dots which were\nstray meteoric matter in the space between worlds in this system. What\nhad been a spot--the Plumie ship--was now a line of dots. Baird pressed\nthe button.\n\n\"Radar reporting!\" he said curtly. \"The Plumie ship is heading for us.\nI'll have relative velocity in ten seconds.\"\n\nHe heard the skipper swear. Ten seconds later the Doppler measurement\nbecame possible. It said the Plumie plunged toward the _Niccola_ at miles\nper second. In half a minute it was tens of miles per second. There was\nno re-transmission of signals. The Plumie ship had found itself\ndiscovered. Apparently it considered itself attacked. It flung itself\ninto a headlong dash for the _Niccola_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTime passed--interminable time. The sun flared and flamed and writhed in\nemptiness. The great gas-giant planet rolled through space in splendid\nstate, its moonlets spinning gracefully about its bulk. The\noxygen-atmosphere planet to sunward was visible only as a crescent, but\nthe mottlings on its lighted part changed as it revolved--seas and\nislands and continents receiving the sunlight as it turned. Meteor\nswarms, so dense in appearance on a radar screen, yet so tenuous in\nreality, floated in their appointed orbits with a seeming vast leisure.\n\nThe feel of slowness was actually the result of distance. Men have always\nacted upon things close by. Battles have always been fought within\neye-range, anyhow. But it was actually 06 hours 35 minutes ship time\nbefore the two spacecraft sighted each other--more than two hours after\nthey plunged toward a rendezvous.\n\nThe Plumie ship was a bright golden dot, at first. It decelerated\nswiftly. In minutes it was a rounded, end-on disk. Then it swerved\nlightly and presented an elliptical broadside to the _Niccola_. The\n_Niccola_ was in full deceleration too, by then. The two ships came very\nnearly to a stop with relation to each other when they were hardly twenty\nmiles apart--which meant great daring on both sides.\n\nBaird heard the skipper grumbling:\n\n\"_Damned cocky!_\" He roared suddenly: \"_Mr. Baird! How've you made out in\ncommunicating with them?_\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir,\" said Baird grimly. \"They don't reply.\"\n\nHe knew from Diane's expression that there was no sound in the headphones\nexcept the frying noise all main-sequence stars give out, and the\ninfrequent thumping noises that come from gas-giant planets' lower\natmospheres, and the Jansky-radiation hiss which comes from everywhere.\n\nThe skipper swore. The Plumie ship lay broadside to, less than a score of\nmiles away. It shone in the sunlight. It acted with extraordinary\nconfidence. It was as if it dared the _Niccola_ to open fire.\n\nTaine's voice came out of a speaker, harsh and angry:\n\n\"_Even-numbered tubes prepare to fire on command._\"\n\nNothing happened. The two ships floated sunward together, neither\napproaching nor retreating. But with every second, the need for action of\nsome sort increased.\n\n\"_Mr. Baird!_\" barked the skipper. \"_This is ridiculous! There must be\nsome way to communicate! We can't sit here glaring at each other forever!\nRaise them! Get some sort of acknowledgment!_\"\n\n\"I'm trying,\" said Baird bitterly, \"according to orders!\"\n\nBut he disagreed with those orders. It was official theory that\narithmetic values, repeated in proper order, would be the way to open\nconversation. The assumption was that any rational creature would grasp\nthe idea that orderly signals were rational attempts to open\ncommunication.\n\nBut it had occurred to Baird that a Plumie might not see this point.\nPerception of order is not necessarily perception of information--in\nfact, quite the contrary. A message is a disturbance of order. A\nmicrophone does not transmit a message when it sends an unvarying tone. A\nmessage has to be unpredictable or it conveys no message. Orderly clicks,\neven if overheard, might seem to Plumies the result of methodically\noperating machinery. A race capable of interstellar flight was not likely\nto be interested or thrilled by exercises a human child goes through in\nkindergarten. They simply wouldn't seem meaningful at all.\n\nBut before he could ask permission to attempt to make talk in a more\nsophisticated fashion, voices exclaimed all over the ship. They came\nblurringly to the loud-speakers. \"_Look at that!_\" \"_What's he do--_\"\n\"_Spinning like--_\" From every place where there was a vision-plate on\nthe _Niccola_, men watched the Plumie ship and babbled.\n\nThis was at 06 hours 50 minutes ship time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe elliptical golden object darted into swift and eccentric motion.\nLacking an object of known size for comparison, there was no scale. The\ngolden ship might have been the size of an autumn leaf, and in fact its\nmaneuvers suggested the heedless tumblings and scurrying of falling\nfoliage. It fluttered in swift turns and somersaults and spinnings. There\nwere weavings like the purposeful feints of boxers not yet come to\nbattle. There were indescribably graceful swoops and loops and curving\ndashes like some preposterous dance in emptiness.\n\nTaine's voice crashed out of a speaker:\n\n\"_All even-number rockets_,\" he barked. \"_Fire!_\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe skipper roared a countermand, but too late. The crunching, grunting\nsound of rockets leaving their launching tubes came before his first\nsyllable was complete. Then there was silence while the skipper gathered\nbreath for a masterpiece of profanity. But Taine snapped:\n\n\"_That dance was a sneak-up! The Plumie came four miles nearer while we\nwatched!_\"\n\nBaird jerked his eyes from watching the Plumie. He looked at the master\nradar. It was faintly blurred with the fading lines of past gyrations,\nbut the golden ship was much nearer the _Niccola_ than it had been.\n\n\"Radar reporting,\" said Baird sickishly. \"Mr. Taine is correct. The\nPlumie ship did approach us while it danced.\"\n\nTaine's voice snarled:\n\n\"_Reload even numbers with chemical-explosive war heads. Then remove\natomics from odd numbers and replace with chemicals. The range is too\nshort for atomics._\"\n\nBaird felt curiously divided in his own mind. He disliked Taine very\nmuch. Taine was arrogant and suspicious and intolerant even on the\n_Niccola_. But Taine had been right twice, now. The Plumie ship had crept\ncloser by pure trickery. And it was right to remove atomic war heads from\nthe rockets. They had a pure-blast radius of ten miles. To destroy the\nPlumie ship within twice that would endanger the _Niccola_--and leave\nnothing of the Plumie to examine afterward.\n\nThe Plumie ship must have seen the rocket flares, but it continued to\ndance, coming nearer and ever nearer in seemingly heedless and\npurposeless plungings and spinnings in star-speckled space. But suddenly\nthere were racing, rushing trails of swirling vapor. Half the _Niccola's_\nport broadside plunged toward the golden ship. The fraction of a second\nlater, the starboard half-dozen chemical-explosive rockets swung\nfuriously around the ship's hull and streaked after their brothers. They\nmoved in utterly silent, straight-lined, ravening ferocity toward their\ntarget. Baird thought irrelevantly of the vapor trails of an\natmosphere-liner in the planet's upper air.\n\nThe ruled-line straightness of the first six rockets' course abruptly\nbroke. One of them veered crazily out of control. It shifted to an almost\nright-angled course. A second swung wildly to the left. A third and\nfourth and fifth--The sixth of the first line of rockets made a great,\nsweeping turn and came hurtling back toward the _Niccola_. It was like a\nnightmare. Lunatic, erratic lines of sunlit vapor eeled before the\nbackground of all the stars in creation.\n\nThen the second half-dozen rockets broke ranks, as insanely and\nirremediably as the first.\n\nTaine's voice screamed out of a speaker, hysterical with fury:\n\n\"_Detonate! Detonate! They've taken over the rockets and are throwing 'em\nback at us! Detonate all rockets!_\"\n\nThe heavens seemed streaked and laced with lines of expanding smoke. But\nnow one plunging line erupted at its tip. A swelling globe of smoke\nmarked its end. Another blew up. And another--\n\nThe _Niccola's_ rockets faithfully blew themselves to bits on command\nfrom the _Niccola's_ own weapons control. There was nothing else to be\ndone with them. They'd been taken over in flight. They'd been turned and\nheaded back toward their source. They'd have blasted the _Niccola_ to\nbits but for their premature explosions.\n\nThere was a peculiar, stunned hush all through the _Niccola_. The only\nsound that came out of any speaker in the radar room was Taine's voice,\nhigh-pitched and raging, mouthing unspeakable hatred of the Plumies, whom\nno human being had yet seen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBaird sat tense in the frustrated and desperate composure of the man who\ncan only be of use while he is sitting still and keeping his head. The\nvision screen was now a blur of writhing mist, lighted by the sun and\ntorn at by emptiness. There was luminosity where the ships had\nencountered each other. It was sunshine upon thin smoke. It was like the\ninsanely enlarging head of a newborn comet, whose tail would be formed\npresently by light-pressure. The Plumie ship was almost invisible behind\nthe unsubstantial stuff.\n\nBut Baird regarded his radar screens. Microwaves penetrated the mist of\nrapidly ionizing gases.\n\n\"Radar to navigation!\" he said sharply. \"The Plumie ship is still\napproaching, dancing as before!\"\n\nThe skipper said with enormous calm:\n\n\"_Any other Plumie ships, Mr. Baird?_\"\n\nDiane interposed.\n\n\"No sign anywhere. I've been watching. This seems to be the only ship\nwithin radar range.\"\n\n\"_We've time to settle with it, then_,\" said the skipper. \"_Mr. Taine,\nthe Plumie ship is still approaching._\"\n\nBaird found himself hating the Plumies. It was not only that humankind\nwas showing up rather badly, at the moment. It was that the Plumie ship\nhad refused contact and forced a fight. It was that if the _Niccola_ were\ndestroyed the Plumie would carry news of the existence of humanity and of\nthe tactics which worked to defeat them. The Plumies could prepare an\nirresistible fleet. Humanity could be doomed.\n\nBut he overheard himself saying bitterly:\n\n\"I wish I'd known this was coming, Diane. I ... wouldn't have resolved to\nbe strictly official, only, until we got back to base.\"\n\nHer eyes widened. She looked startled. Then she softened.\n\n\"If ... you mean that ... I wish so too.\"\n\n\"It looks like they've got us,\" he admitted unhappily. \"If they can take\nour rockets away from us--\" Then his voice stopped. He said, \"Hold\neverything!\" and pressed the navigation-room button. He snapped: \"Radar\nto navigation. It appears to take the Plumies several seconds to take\nover a rocket. They have to aim something--a pressor or tractor beam,\nmost likely--and pick off each rocket separately. Nearly forty seconds\nwas consumed in taking over all twelve of our rockets. At shorter range,\nwith less time available, a rocket might get through!\"\n\nThe skipper swore briefly. Then:\n\n\"_Mr. Taine! When the Plumies are near enough, our rockets may strike\nbefore they can be taken over! You follow?_\"\n\nBaird heard Taine's shrill-voiced acknowledgment--in the form of\npractically chattered orders to his rocket-tube crews. Baird listened,\nchecking the orders against what the situation was as the radars saw it.\nTaine's voice was almost unhuman; so filled with frantic rage that it\ncracked as he spoke. But the problem at hand was the fulfillment of all\nhis psychopathic urges. He commanded the starboard-side rocket-battery to\nawait special orders. Meanwhile the port-side battery would fire two\nrockets on widely divergent courses, curving to join at the Plumie ship.\nThey'd be seized. They were to be detonated and another port-side rocket\nfired instantly, followed by a second hidden in the rocket-trail the\nfirst would leave behind. Then the starboard side--\n\n\"I'm afraid Taine's our only chance,\" said Baird reluctantly. \"If he\nwins, we'll have time to ... talk as people do who like each other. If it\ndoesn't work--\"\n\nDiane said quietly:\n\n\"Anyhow ... I'm glad you ... wanted me to know. I ... wanted you to know,\ntoo.\"\n\nShe smiled at him, yearningly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_There was the crump-crump_ of two rockets going out together. Then the\nradar told what happened. The Plumie ship was no more than six miles\naway, dancing somehow deftly in the light of a yellow sun, with all the\ncosmos spread out as shining pin points of colored light behind it. The\nradar reported the dash and the death of the two rockets, after their\nstruggle with invisible things that gripped them. They died when they\nheaded reluctantly back to the _Niccola_--and detonated two miles from\ntheir parent ship. The skipper's voice came:\n\n\"_Mr. Taine! After your next salvo I shall head for the Plumie at full\ndrive, to cut down the distance and the time they have to work in. Be\nready!_\"\n\nThe rocket tubes went _crump-crump_ again, with a fifth of a second\ninterval. The radar showed two tiny specks speeding through space toward\nthe weaving, shifting speck which was the Plumie.\n\nOutside, in emptiness, there was a filmy haze. It was the rocket-fumes\nand explosive gases spreading with incredible speed. It was thin as\ngossamer. The Plumie ship undoubtedly spotted the rockets, but it did not\ntry to turn them. It somehow seized them and deflected them, and darted\npast them toward the _Niccola_.\n\n\"They see the trick,\" said Diane, dry-throated. \"If they can get in close\nenough, they can turn it against us!\"\n\nThere were noises inside the _Niccola_, now. Taine fairly howled an\norder. There were yells of defiance and excitement. There were more of\nthose inadequate noises as rockets went out--every tube on the starboard\nside emptied itself in a series of savage grunts--and the _Niccola's_\nmagnetronic drive roared at full flux density.\n\nThe two ships were less than a mile apart when the _Niccola_ let go her\nfull double broadside of missiles. And then it seemed that the Plumie\nship was doomed. There were simply too many rockets to be seized and\nhandled before at least one struck. But there was a new condition. The\nPlumie ship weaved and dodged its way through them. The new condition was\nthat the rockets were just beginning their run. They had not achieved the\nterrific velocity they would accumulate in ten miles of no-gravity. They\nwere new-launched; logy: clumsy: not the streaking, flashing\ndeath-and-destruction they would become with thirty more seconds of\nacceleration.\n\nSo the Plumie ship dodged them with a skill and daring past belief. With\nan incredible agility it got inside them, nearer to the _Niccola_ than\nthey. And then it hurled itself at the human ship as if bent upon a\nsuicidal crash which would destroy both ships together. But Baird, in the\nradar room, and the skipper in navigation, knew that it would plunge\nbrilliantly past at the last instant--\n\nAnd then they knew that it would not. Because, very suddenly and very\nabruptly, there was something the matter with the Plumie ship. The life\nwent out of it. It ceased to accelerate or decelerate. It ceased to\nsteer. It began to turn slowly on an axis somewhere amidships. Its nose\nswung to one side, with no change in the direction of its motion. It\nfloated onward. It was broadside to its line of travel. It continued to\nturn. It hurtled stern-first toward the _Niccola_. It did not swerve. It\ndid not dance. It was a lifeless hulk: a derelict in space.\n\nAnd it would hit the _Niccola_ amidships with no possible result but\ndestruction for both vessels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Niccola's_ skipper bellowed orders, as if shouting would somehow\ngive them more effect. The magnetronic drive roared. He'd demanded a\nmiracle of it, and he almost got one. The drive strained its\nthrust-members. It hopelessly overloaded its coils. The _Niccola's_\ncobalt-steel hull became more than saturated with the drive-field, and it\nleaped madly upon an evasion course--\n\nAnd it very nearly got away. It was swinging clear when the Plumie ship\ndrifted within fathoms. It was turning aside when the Plumie ship was\nwithin yards. And it was almost safe when the golden hull of the\nPlumie--shadowed now by the _Niccola_ itself--barely scraped a side-keel.\n\nThere was a touch, seemingly deliberate and gentle. But the _Niccola_\nshuddered horribly. Then the vision screens flared from such a light as\nmight herald the crack of doom. There was a brightness greater than the\nbrilliance of the sun. And then there was a wrenching, heaving shock.\nThen there was blackness. Baird was flung across the radar room, and\nDiane cried out, and he careened against a wall and heard glass shatter.\nHe called:\n\n\"Diane!\"\n\nHe clutched crazily at anything, and called her name again. The\n_Niccola's_ internal gravity was cut off, and his head spun, and he heard\ncollision-doors closing everywhere, but before they closed completely he\nheard the rasping sound of giant arcs leaping in the engine room. Then\nthere was silence.\n\n\"Diane!\" cried Baird fiercely. \"Diane!\"\n\n\"I'm ... here,\" she panted. \"I'm dizzy, but I ... think I'm all right--\"\n\nThe battery-powered emergency light came on. It was faint, but he saw her\nclinging to a bank of instruments where she'd been thrown by the\ncollision. He moved to go to her, and found himself floating in midair.\nBut he drifted to a side wall and worked his way to her.\n\nShe clung to him, shivering.\n\n\"I ... think,\" she said unsteadily, \"that we're going to die. Aren't we?\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" he told her. \"Hold on to me.\"\n\nGuided by the emergency light, he scrambled to the bank of\ncommunicator-buttons. What had been the floor was now a side wall. He\nclimbed it and thumbed the navigation-room switch.\n\n\"Radar room reporting,\" he said curtly. \"Power out, gravity off, no\nreports from outside from power failure. No great physical damage.\"\n\nHe began to hear other voices. There had never been an actual\nspace-collision in the memory of man, but reports came crisply, and the\ncut-in speakers in the radar room repeated them. Ship-gravity was out all\nover the ship. Emergency lights were functioning, and were all the lights\nthere were. There was a slight, unexplained gravity-drift toward what had\nbeen the ship's port side. But damage-control reported no loss of\npressure in the _Niccola's_ inner hull, though four areas between inner\nand outer hulls had lost air pressure to space.\n\n\"_Mr. Baird_,\" rasped the skipper. \"_We're blind! Forget everything else\nand give us eyes to see with!_\"\n\n\"We'll try battery power to the vision plates,\" Baird told Diane. \"No\nfull resolution, but better than nothing--\"\n\nThey worked together, feverishly. They were dizzy. Something close to\nnausea came upon them from pure giddiness. What had been the floor was\nnow a wall, and they had to climb to reach the instruments that had been\non a wall and now were on the ceiling. But their weight was ounces only.\nBaird said abruptly:\n\n\"I know what's the matter! We're spinning! The whole ship's spinning!\nThat's why we're giddy and why we have even a trace of weight.\nCentrifugal force! Ready for the current?\"\n\nThere was a tiny click, and the battery light dimmed. But a vision screen\nlighted faintly. The stars it showed were moving specks of light. The sun\npassed deliberately across the screen. Baird switched to other outside\nscanners. There was power for only one screen at a time. But he saw the\nstarkly impossible. He pressed the navigation-room button.\n\n\"Radar room reporting,\" he said urgently. \"The Plumie ship is fast to us,\nin contact with our hull! Both ships are spinning together!\" He was\ntrying yet other scanners as he spoke, and now he said: \"Got it! There\nare no lines connecting us to the Plumie, but it looks ... yes! That\nflash when the ships came together was a flash-over of high potential.\nWe're welded to them along twenty feet of our hull!\"\n\nThe skipper:\n\n\"_Damnation! Any sign of intention to board us?_\"\n\n\"Not yet, sir--\"\n\nTaine burst in, his voice high-pitched and thick with hatred:\n\n\"_Damage-control parties attention! Arm yourselves and assemble at\nstarboard air lock! Rocket crews get into suits and prepare to board this\nPlumie--_\"\n\n\"_Countermand!_\" bellowed the skipper from the speaker beside Baird's\near. \"_Those orders are canceled! Dammit, if we were successfully boarded\nwe'd blow ourselves to bits! Those are our orders! D'you think the\nPlumies will let their ship be taken? And wouldn't we blow up with them?\nMr. Taine, you will take no offensive action without specific orders!\nDefensive action is another matter. Mr. Baird! I consider this welding\nbusiness pure accident. No one would be mad enough to plan it. You watch\nthe Plumies and keep me informed!_\"\n\nHis voice ceased. And Baird had again the frustrating duty of remaining\nstill and keeping his head while other men engaged in physical\nactivity. He helped Diane to a chair--which was fastened to the\nfloor-which-was-now-a-wall--and she wedged herself fast and began a\nreview of what each of the outside scanners reported. Baird called for\nmore batteries. Power for the radar and visions was more important than\nanything else, just then. If there were more Plumie ships ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nElectricians half-floated, half-dragged extra batteries to the radar\nroom. Baird hooked them in. The universe outside the ship again appeared\nfilled with brilliantly colored dots of light which were stars. More\nsatisfying, the globe-scanners again reported no new objects anywhere.\nNothing new within a quarter million miles. A half-million. Later Baird\nreported:\n\n\"Radars report no strange objects within a million miles of the\n_Niccola_, sir.\"\n\n\"_Except the ship we're welded to! But you are doing very well. However,\nmicrophones say there is movement inside the Plumie._\"\n\nDiane beckoned for Baird's attention to a screen, which Baird had\nexamined before. Now he stiffened and motioned for her to report.\n\n\"We've a scanner, sir,\" said Diane, \"which faces what looks like a port\nin the Plumie ship. There's a figure at the port. I can't make out\ndetails, but it is making motions, facing us.\"\n\n\"_Give me the picture!_\" snapped the skipper.\n\nDiane obeyed. It was the merest flip of a switch. Then her eyes went\nback to the spherical-sweep scanners which reported the bearing and\ndistance of every solid object within their range. She set up two\ninstruments which would measure the angle, bearing, and distance of the\ntwo planets now on this side of the sun--the gas-giant and the\noxygen-world to sunward. Their orbital speeds and distances were known.\nThe position, course, and speed of the _Niccola_ could be computed from\nany two observations on them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDiane had returned to the utterly necessary routine of the radar room\nwhich was the nerve-center of the ship, gathering all information needed\nfor navigation in space. The fact that there had been a collision, that\nthe _Niccola's_ engines were melted to unlovely scrap, that the Plumie\nship was now welded irremovably to a side-keel, and that a Plumie was\nsignaling to humans while both ships went spinning through space toward\nan unknown destination--these things did not affect the obligations of\nthe radar room.\n\nBaird got other images of the Plumie ship into sharp focus. So near, the\nscanners required adjustment for precision.\n\n\"Take a look at this!\" he said wryly.\n\nShe looked. The view was of the Plumie as welded fast to the _Niccola_.\nThe welding was itself an extraordinary result of the Plumie's\nbattle-tactics. Tractor and pressor beams were known to men, of course,\nbut human beings used them only under very special conditions. Their\noperation involved the building-up of terrific static charges. Unless a\ntractor-beam generator could be grounded to the object it was to pull, it\ntended to emit lightning-bolts at unpredictable intervals and in entirely\nrandom directions. So men didn't use them. Obviously, the Plumies did.\n\nThey'd handled the _Niccola's_ rockets with beams which charged the\ngolden ship to billions of volts. And when the silicon-bronze Plumie ship\ntouched the cobalt-steel _Niccola_--why--that charge had to be shared. It\nmust have been the most spectacular of all artificial electric flames.\nPart of the _Niccola's_ hull was vaporized, and undoubtedly part of the\nPlumie. But the unvaporized surfaces were molten and in contact--and they\nstuck.\n\nFor a good twenty feet the two ships were united by the most perfect of\nvacuum-welds. The wholly dissimilar hulls formed a space-catamaran, with\na sort of valley between their bulks. Spinning deliberately, as the\nunited ships did, sometimes the sun shone brightly into that valley, and\nsometimes it was filled with the blackness of the pit.\n\nWhile Diane looked, a round door revolved in the side of the Plumie ship.\nAs Diane caught her breath, Baird reported crisply. At his first words\nTaine burst into raging commands for men to follow him through the\n_Niccola's_ air lock and fight a boarding party of Plumies in empty\nspace. The skipper very savagely ordered him to be quiet.\n\n\"Only one figure has come out,\" reported Baird. The skipper watched on a\nvision plate, but Baird reported so all the _Niccola's_ company would\nknow. \"It's small--less than five feet ... I'll see better in a moment.\"\nSunlight smote down into the valley between the ships. \"It's wearing a\npressure suit. It seems to be the same material as the ship. It walks on\ntwo legs, as we do ... It has two arms, or something very similar ... The\nhelmet of the suit is very high ... It looks like the armor knights used\nto fight in ... It's making its way to our air lock ... It does not use\nmagnetic-soled shoes. It's holding onto lines threaded along the other\nship's hull ...\"\n\nThe skipper said curtly:\n\n\"_Mr. Baird! I hadn't noticed the absence of magnetic shoes. You seem to\nhave an eye for important items. Report to the air lock in person. Leave\nLieutenant Holt to keep an eye on outside objects. Quickly, Mr. Baird!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBaird laid his hand on Diane's shoulder. She smiled at him.\n\n\"I'll watch!\" she promised.\n\nHe went out of the radar room, walking on what had been a side wall. The\ngiddiness and dizziness of continued rotation was growing less, now. He\nwas getting used to it. But the _Niccola_ seemed strange indeed, with the\nstandard up and down and Earth-gravity replaced by a vertical which was\nall askew and a weight of ounces instead of a hundred and seventy pounds.\n\nHe reached the air lock just as the skipper arrived. There were others\nthere--armed and in pressure suits. The skipper glared about him.\n\n\"I am in command here,\" he said very grimly indeed. \"Mr. Taine has a\nspecial function, but I am in command! We and the creatures on the Plumie\nship are in a very serious fix. One of them apparently means to come on\nboard. There will be no hostility, no sneering, no threatening gestures!\nThis is a parley! You will be careful. But you will not be\ntrigger-happy!\"\n\nHe glared around again, just as a metallic rapping came upon the\n_Niccola's_ air-lock door. The skipper nodded:\n\n\"Let him in the lock, Mr. Baird.\"\n\nBaird obeyed. The humming of the unlocking-system sounded. There were\nclankings. The outer air lock dosed. There was a faint whistling as air\nwent in. The skipper nodded again.\n\nBaird opened the inner door. It was 08 hours 10 minutes ship time.\n\nThe Plumie stepped confidently out into the topsy-turvy corridors of the\n_Niccola_. He was about the size of a ten-year-old human boy, and\nfeatures which were definitely not grotesque showed through the clear\nplastic of his helmet. His pressure suit was, engineering-wise, a very\nclean job. His whole appearance was prepossessing. When he spoke, very\nclear and quite high sounds--soprano sounds--came from a small\nspeaker-unit at his shoulder.\n\n\"For us to talk,\" said the skipper heavily, \"is pure nonsense. But I take\nit you've something to say.\"\n\nThe Plumie gazed about with an air of lively curiosity. Then he drew out\na flat pad with a white surface and sketched swiftly. He offered it to\nthe _Niccola's_ skipper.\n\n\"We want this on record,\" he growled, staring about.\n\nDiane's voice said capably from a speaker somewhere nearby:\n\n\"_Sir, there's a scanner for inspection of objects brought aboard. Hold\nthe plate flat and I'll have a photograph--right!_\"\n\nThe skipper said curtly to the Plumie:\n\n\"You've drawn our two ships linked as they are. What have you to say\nabout it?\"\n\nHe handed back the plate. The Plumie pressed a stud and it was blank\nagain. He sketched and offered it once more.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said the skipper. \"You can't use your drive while we're glued\ntogether, eh? Well?\"\n\nThe Plumie reached up and added lines to the drawing.\n\n\"So!\" rumbled the skipper, inspecting the additions. \"You say it's up to\nus to use our drive for both ships.\" He growled approvingly: \"You\nconsider there's a truce. You must, because we're both in the same fix,\nand not a nice one, either. True enough! We can't fight each other\nwithout committing suicide, now. But we haven't any drive left! We're a\nderelict! How am I going to say that--if I decide to?\"\n\nBaird could see the lines on the plate, from the angle at which the\nskipper held it. He said:\n\n\"Sir, we've been mapping, up in the radar room. Those last lines are\nmap-co-ordinates--a separate sketch, sir. I think he's saying that the\ntwo ships, together, are on a falling course toward the sun. That we have\nto do something or both vessels will fall into it. We should be able to\ncheck this, sir.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" growled the skipper. \"That's all we need! Absolutely all we need!\nTo come here, get into a crazy right, have our drive melt to scrap, get\ncrazily welded to a Plumie ship, and then for both of us to fry together!\nWe don't need anything more than that!\"\n\nDiane's voice came on the speaker:\n\n\"_Sir, the last radar fixes on the planets in range give us a course\ndirectly toward the sun. I'll repeat the observations._\"\n\nThe skipper growled. Taine thrust himself forward. He snarled:\n\n\"Why doesn't this Plumie take off its helmet? It lands on oxygen planets!\nDoes it think it's too good to breathe our air?\"\n\nBaird caught the Plumie's eye. He made a gesture suggesting the removal\nof the space helmet. The Plumie gestured, in return, to a tiny vent in\nthe suit. He opened something and gas whistled out. He cut it off. The\nquestion of why he did not open or remove his helmet was answered. The\natmosphere he breathed would not do men any good, nor would theirs do him\nany good, either. Taine said suspiciously:\n\n\"How do we know he's breathing the stuff he let out then? This creature\nisn't human! It's got no right to attack humans! Now it's trying to trick\nus!\" His voice changed to a snarl. \"We'd better wring its neck! Teach its\nkind a lesson--\"\n\nThe skipper roared at him.\n\n\"Be quiet! Our ship is a wreck! We have to consider the facts! We and\nthese Plumies are in a fix together, and we have to get out of it before\nwe start to teach anybody anything!\" He glared at Taine. Then he said\nheavily: \"Mr. Baird, you seem to notice things. Take this Plumie over the\nship. Show him our drive melted down, so he'll realize we can't possibly\ntow his ship into an orbit. He knows that we're armed, and that we can't\nhandle our war heads at this range! So we can't fool each other. We might\nas well be frank. But you will take full note of his reactions, Mr.\nBaird!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBaird advanced, and the skipper made a gesture. The Plumie regarded Baird\nwith interested eyes. And Baird led the way for a tour of the _Niccola_.\nIt was confusing even to him, with right hand converted to up and left\nhand to down, and sidewise now almost vertical. On the way the Plumie\nmade more clear, flutelike sounds, and more gestures. Baird answered.\n\n\"Our gravity pull was that way,\" he explained, \"and things fell so fast.\"\n\nHe grasped a handrail and demonstrated the speed with which things fell\nin normal ship-gravity. He used a pocket communicator for the falling\nweight. It was singularly easy to say some things, even highly technical\nones, because they'd be what the Plumie would want to know. But quite\ncommonplace things would be very difficulty to convey.\n\nDiane's voice came out of the communicator.\n\n\"_There are no novelties outside_,\" she said quietly. \"_It looks like\nthis is the only Plumie ship anywhere around. It could have been\nexploring, like us. Maybe it was looking for the people who put up\nSpace-Survey markers._\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" agreed Baird, using the communicator. \"Is that stuff about\nfalling into the sun correct?\"\n\n\"_It seems so_,\" said Diane composedly. \"_I'm checking again. So far, the\nbest course I can get means we graze the sun's photosphere in fourteen\ndays six hours, allowing for acceleration by the sun's gravity._\"\n\n\"And you and I,\" said Baird wryly, \"have been acting as professional\nassociates only, when--\"\n\n\"_Don't say it!_\" said Diane shakily. \"_It's terrible!_\"\n\nHe put the communicator back in his pocket. The Plumie had watched him.\nHe had a peculiarly gallant air, this small figure in golden space armor\nwith its high-crested helmet.\n\nThey reached the engine room. And there was the giant drive shaft of the\n_Niccola_, once wrapped with yard-thick coils which could induce an\nincredible density of magnetic flux in the metal. Even the return\nmagnetic field, through the ship's cobalt-steel hull, was many times\nhigher than saturation. Now the coils were sagging: mostly melted. There\nwere places where re-solidified metal smoked noisomely against\nnonmetallic floor or wall-covering. Engineers labored doggedly in the\ntrivial gravity to clean up the mess.\n\n\"It's past repair,\" said Baird, to the ship's first engineer.\n\n\"It's junk,\" said that individual dourly. \"Give us six months and a place\nto set up a wire-drawing mill and an insulator synthesizer, and we could\nrebuild it. But nothing less will be any good.\"\n\nThe Plumie stared at the drive. He examined the shaft from every angle.\nHe inspected the melted, and partly-melted, and merely burned-out\nsections of the drive coils. He was plainly unable to understand in any\nfashion the principle of the magnetronic drive. Baird was tempted to try\nto explain, because there was surely no secret about a ship drive, but he\ncould imagine no diagrams or gestures which would convey the theory of\nwhat happened in cobalt-steel when it was magnetized beyond one hundred\nthousand Gauss' flux-density. And without that theory one simply couldn't\nexplain a magnetronic drive.\n\nThey left the engine room. They visited the rocket batteries. The\ngenerator room was burned out, like the drive, by the inconceivable\nlightning bolt which had passed between the ships on contact. The Plumie\nwas again puzzled. Baird made it clear that the generator-room supplied\nelectric current for the ship's normal lighting-system and services. The\nPlumie could grasp that idea. They examined the crew's quarters, and the\nmess room, and the Plumie walked confidently among the members of the\nhuman crew, who a little while since had tried so painstakingly to\ndestroy his vessel. He made a good impression.\n\n\"These little guys,\" said a crewman to Baird, admiringly, \"they got\nsomething. They can handle a ship! I bet they could almost make that ship\nof theirs play checkers!\"\n\n\"Close to it,\" agreed Baird. He realized something. He pulled the\ncommunicator from his pocket. \"Diane! Contact the skipper. He wanted\nobservations. Here's one. This Plumie acts like soldiers used to act in\nancient days--when they wore armor. And we have the same reaction! They\nwill fight like the devil, but during a truce they'll be friendly,\nadmiring each other as scrappers, but ready to fight as hard as ever when\nthe truce is over. We have the same reaction! Tell the skipper I've an\nidea that it's a part of their civilization--maybe it's a necessary part\nof any civilization! Tell him I guess that there may be necessarily\nparallel evolution of attitudes, among rational races, as there are\nparallel evolutions of eyes and legs and wings and fins among all animals\neverywhere! If I'm right, somebody from this ship will be invited to tour\nthe Plumie! It's only a guess, but tell him!\"\n\n\"_Immediately_,\" said Diane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Plumie followed gallantly as Baird made a steep climb up what once\nwas the floor of a corridor. Then Taine stepped out before them. His eyes\nburned.\n\n\"Giving him a clear picture, eh?\" he rasped. \"Letting him spy out\neverything?\"\n\nBaird pressed the communicator call for the radar room and said coldly:\n\n\"I'm obeying orders. Look, Taine! You were picked for your job because\nyou were a xenophobe. It helps in your proper functioning. But this\nPlumie is here under a flag of truce--\"\n\n\"Flag of truce!\" snarled Taine. \"It's vermin! It's not human! I'll--\"\n\n\"If you move one inch nearer him,\" said Baird gently, \"just one inch--\"\n\nThe skipper's voice bellowed through the general call speakers all over\nthe ship:\n\n\"_Mr. Taine! You will go to your quarters, under arrest! Mr. Baird, burn\nhim down if he hesitates!_\"\n\nThen there was a rushing, and scrambling figures appeared and were all\nabout. They were members of the _Niccola's_ crew, sent by the skipper.\nThey regarded the Plumie with detachment, but Taine with a wary\nexpectancy. Taine turned purple with fury. He shouted. He raged. He\ncalled Baird and the others Plumie-lovers and vermin-worshipers. He\nshouted foulnesses at them. But he did not attack.\n\nWhen, still shouting, he went away, Baird said apologetically to the\nPlumie:\n\n\"He's a xenophobe. He has a pathological hatred of strangers--even of\nstrangeness. We have him on board because--\"\n\nThen he stopped. The Plumie wouldn't understand, of course. But his eyes\ntook on a curious look. It was almost as if, looking at Baird, they\ntwinkled.\n\nBaird took him back to the skipper.\n\n\"He's got the picture, sir,\" he reported.\n\nThe Plumie pulled out his sketch plate. He drew on it. He offered it. The\nskipper said heavily:\n\n\"You guessed right, Mr. Baird. He suggests that someone from this ship go\non board the Plumie vessel. He's drawn two pressure-suited figures going\nin their air lock. One's larger than the other. Will you go?\"\n\n\"Naturally!\" said Baird. Then he added thoughtfully: \"But I'd better\ncarry a portable scanner, sir. It should work perfectly well through a\nbronze hull, sir.\"\n\nThe skipper nodded and began to sketch a diagram which would amount to an\nacceptance of the Plumie's invitation.\n\nThis was at 07 hours 40 minutes ship time. Outside the sedately rotating\nmetal hulls--the one a polished blue-silver and the other a glittering\ngolden bronze--the cosmos continued to be as always. The haze from\nexplosive fumes and rocket-fuel was, perhaps, a little thinner. The\nbrighter stars shone through it. The gas-giant planet outward from the\nsun was a perceptible disk instead of a diffuse glow. The oxygen-planet\nto sunward showed again as a lighted crescent.\n\nPresently Baird, in a human spacesuit, accompanied the Plumie into the\n_Niccola's_ air lock and out to emptiness. His magnetic-soled shoes clung\nto the _Niccola's_ cobalt-steel skin. Fastened to his shoulder there was\na tiny scanner and microphone, which would relay everything he saw and\nheard back to the radar room and to Diane.\n\nShe watched tensely as he went inside the Plumie ship. Other screens\nrelayed the image and his voice to other places on the _Niccola_.\n\nHe was gone a long time. From the beginning, of course, there were\nsurprises. When the Plumie escort removed his helmet, on his own ship,\nthe reason for the helmet's high crest was apparent. He had a high crest\nof what looked remarkably like feathers--and it was not artificial. It\ngrew there. The reason for conventionalized plumes on bronze survey\nplates was clear. It was exactly like the reason for human features or\nfigures as decorative additions to the inscriptions on Space Survey\nmarker plates. Even the Plumie's hands had odd crestlets which stood out\nwhen he bent his fingers. The other Plumies were no less graceful and no\nless colorful. They had equally clear soprano voices. They were equally\nminiature and so devoid of apparent menace.\n\nBut there were also technical surprises. Baird was taken immediately to\nthe Plumie ship's engine room, and Diane heard the sharp intake of breath\nwith which he appeared to recognize its working principle. There were\nPlumie engineers working feverishly at it, attempting to discover\nsomething to repair. But they found nothing. The Plumie drive simply\nwould not work.\n\nThey took Baird through the ship's entire fabric. And their purpose, when\nit became clear, was startling. The Plumie ship had no rocket tubes. It\nhad no beam-projectors except small-sized objects which were--which must\nbe--their projectors of tractor and pressor beams. They were elaborately\ngrounded to the ship's substance. But they were not originally designed\nfor ultra-heavy service. They hadn't and couldn't have the enormous\ncapacity Baird had expected. He was astounded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he returned to the _Niccola_, he went instantly to the radar room to\nmake sure that pictures taken through his scanner had turned out well.\nAnd there was Diane.\n\nBut the skipper's voice boomed at him from the wall.\n\n\"_Mr. Baird! What have you to add to the information you sent back?_\"\n\n\"Three items, sir,\" said Baird. He drew a deep breath. \"For the first,\nsir, the Plumie ship is unarmed. They've tractor and pressor beams for\nhandling material. They probably use them to build their cairns. But they\nweren't meant for weapons. The Plumies, sir, hadn't a thing to fight with\nwhen they drove for us after we detected them.\"\n\nThe skipper blinked hard.\n\n\"_Are you sure of that, Mr. Baird?_\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Baird uncomfortably. \"The Plumie ship is an exploring\nship--a survey ship, sir. You saw their mapping equipment. But when they\nspotted us, and we spotted them--they bluffed! When we fired rockets at\nthem, they turned them back with tractor and pressor beams. They drove\nfor us, sir, to try to destroy us with our own bombs, because they didn't\nhave any of their own.\"\n\nThe skipper's mouth opened and closed.\n\n\"Another item, sir,\" said Baird more uncomfortably still. \"They don't use\niron or steel. Every metal object I saw was either a bronze or a light\nmetal. I suspect some of their equipment's made of potassium, and I'm\nfairly sure they use sodium in the place of aluminum. Their atmosphere's\nquite different from ours--obviously! They'd use bronze for their ship's\nhull because they can venture into an oxygen atmosphere in a bronze ship.\nA sodium-hulled ship would be lighter, but it would burn in oxygen. Where\nthere was moisture--\"\n\nThe skipper blinked.\n\n\"_But they couldn't drive in a non-magnetic hull!_\" he protested. \"_A\nship has to be magnetic to drive!_\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Baird, his voice still shaken, \"they don't use a magnetronic\ndrive. I once saw a picture of the drive they use, in a stereo on the\nhistory of space travel. The principle's very old. We've practically\nforgotten it. It's a Dirac pusher-drive, sir. Among us humans, it came\nright after rockets. The planets of Sol were first reached by ships using\nDirac pushers. But--\" He paused. \"They won't operate in a magnetic field\nabove seventy Gauss, sir. It's a static-charge reaction, sir, and in a\nmagnetic field it simply stops working.\"\n\nThe skipper regarded Baird unwinkingly for a long time.\n\n\"_I think you are telling me_,\" he said at long last, \"_that the Plumies'\ndrive would work if they were cut free of the _Niccola_._\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Baird. \"Their engineers were opening up the\ndrive-elements and checking them, and then closing them up again. They\ncouldn't seem to find anything wrong. I don't think they know what the\ntrouble is. It's the _Niccola's_ magnetic field. I think it was our field\nthat caused the collision by stopping their drive and killing all their\ncontrols when they came close enough.\"\n\n\"_Did you tell them?_\" demanded the skipper.\n\n\"There was no easy way to tell them by diagrams, sir.\"\n\nTaine's voice cut in. It was feverish. It was strident. It was\ntriumphant.\n\n\"_Sir! The _Niccola_ is effectively a wreck and unrepairable. But the\nPlumie ship is operable if cut loose. As weapons officer, I intend to\ntake the Plumie ship, let out its air, fill its tanks with our air, start\nup its drive, and turn it over to you for navigation back to base!_\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBaird raged. But he said coldly:\n\n\"We're a long way from home, Mr. Taine, and the Dirac pusher drive is\nslow. If we headed back to base in the Plumie ship with its Dirac pusher,\nwe'd all be dead of old age before we'd gone halfway.\"\n\n\"_But unless we take it_,\" raged Taine, \"_we hit this sun in fourteen\ndays! We don't have to die now! We can land on the oxygen planet up\nahead! We've only to kill these vermin and take their ship, and we'll\nlive!_\"\n\nDiane's voice said dispassionately:\n\n\"Report. A Plumie in a pressure suit just came out of their air lock.\nIt's carrying a parcel toward our air lock.\"\n\nTaine snarled instantly:\n\n\"_They'll sneak something in the _Niccola_ to blast it, and then cut free\nand go away!_\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe skipper said very grimly:\n\n\"_Mr. Taine, credit me with minimum brains! There is no way the Plumies\ncan take this ship without an atomic bomb exploding to destroy both\nships. You should know it!_\" Then he snapped: \"_Air lock area, listen for\na knock, and let in the Plumie or the parcel he leaves._\"\n\nThere was silence. Baird said very quietly:\n\n\"I doubt they think it possible to cut the ships apart. A torch is no\ngood on thick silicon bronze. It conducts heat too well! And they don't\nuse steel. They probably haven't a cutting-torch at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the radar room he watched the Plumie place an object in the air lock\nand withdraw. He watched from a scanner inside the ship as someone\nbrought in what the Plumie had left. An electronics man bustled forward.\nHe looked it over quickly. It was complex, but his examination suddenly\nseemed satisfying to him. But a grayish vapor developed and he sniffed\nand wrinkled his nose. He picked up a communicator.\n\n\"_Sir, they've sent us a power-generator. Some of its parts are going bad\nin our atmosphere, sir, but this looks to me like a hell of a good idea\nfor a generator! I never saw anything like it, but it's good! You can set\nit for any voltage and it'll turn out plenty juice!_\"\n\n\"_Put it in helium_,\" snapped the skipper. \"_It won't break down in that!\nThen see how it serves!_\"\n\nIn the radar room, Baird drew a deep breath. He went carefully to each of\nthe screens and every radar. Diane saw what he was about, and checked\nwith him. They met at the middle of the radar room.\n\n\"Everything's checked out,\" said Baird gravely. \"There's nothing else\naround. There's nothing we can be called on to do before something\nhappens. So ... we can ... act like people.\"\n\nDiane smiled very faintly.\n\n\"Not like people. Just like us.\" She said wistfully: \"Don't you want to\ntell me something? Something you intended to tell me only after we got\nback to base?\"\n\nHe did. He told it to her. And there was also something she had not\nintended to tell him at all--unless he told her first. She said it now.\nThey felt that such sayings were of the greatest possible importance.\nThey clung together, saying them again. And it seemed wholly monstrous\nthat two people who cared so desperately had wasted so much time acting\nlike professional associates--explorer-ship officers--when things like\nthis were to be said ...\n\nAs they talked incoherently, or were even more eloquently silent, the\nship's ordinary lights came on. The battery-lamp went on.\n\n\"We've got to switch back to ship's circuit,\" said Baird reluctantly.\nThey separated, and restored the operating circuits to normal. \"We've got\nfourteen days,\" he added, \"and so much time to be on duty, and we've a\nlost lifetime to live in fourteen days! Diane--\"\n\nShe flushed vividly. So Baird said very politely into the microphone to\nthe navigation room:\n\n\"Sir, Lieutenant Holt and myself would like to speak directly to you in\nthe navigation room. May we?\"\n\n\"_Why not?_\" growled the skipper. \"_You've noticed that the Plumie\ngenerator is giving the whole ship lights and services?_\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Baird. \"We'll be there right away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey heard the skipper's grunt as they hurried through the door. A moment\nlater the ship's normal gravity returned--also through the Plumie\ngenerator. Up was up again, and down was down, and the corridors and\ncabins of the _Niccola_ were brightly illuminated. Had the ship been\nother than an engineless wreck, falling through a hundred and fifty\nmillion miles of emptiness into the flaming photosphere of a sun,\neverything would have seemed quite normal, including the errand Baird and\nDiane were upon, and the fact that they held hands self-consciously as\nthey went about it.\n\nThey skirted the bulkhead of the main air tank. They headed along the\nbroader corridor which went past the indented inner door of the air lock.\nThey had reached that indentation when Baird saw that the inner air-lock\ndoor was closing. He saw a human pressure suit past its edge. He saw the\ncorner of some object that had been put down on the air-lock floor.\n\nBaird shouted, and rushed toward the lock. He seized the inner handle and\ntried to force open the door again, so that no one inside it could emerge\ninto the emptiness without. He failed. He wrenched frantically at the\ncontrol of the outer door. It suddenly swung freely. The outer door had\nbeen put on manual. It could be and was being opened from inside.\n\n\"Tell the skipper,\" raged Baird. \"Taine's taking something out!\" He tore\nopen a pressure-suit cupboard in the wall beside the lock door. \"He'll\nmake the Plumies think it's a return-gift for the generator!\" He eeled\ninto the pressure suit and zipped it up to his neck. \"The man's crazy! He\nthinks we can take their ship and stay alive for a while! Dammit, our air\nwould ruin half their equipment! Tell the skipper to send help!\"\n\nHe wrenched at the door again, jamming down his helmet with one hand. And\nthis time the control worked. Taine, most probably, had forgotten that\nthe inner control was disengaged only when the manual was actively in\nuse. Diane raced away, panting. Baird swore bitterly at the slowness of\nthe outer door's closing. He was tearing at the inner door long before it\ncould be opened. He flung himself in and dragged it shut, and struck the\nemergency air-release which bled the air lock into space for speed of\noperation. He thrust out the outer door and plunged through.\n\nHis momentum carried him almost too far. He fell, and only the magnetic\nsoles of his shoes enabled him to check himself. He was in that singular\nvalley between the two ships, where their hulls were impregnably welded\nfast. Round-hulled Plumie ship, and ganoid-shaped _Niccola_, they stuck\nimmovably together as if they had been that way since time began. Where\nthe sky appeared above Baird's head, the stars moved in stately\nprocession across the valley roof.\n\nHe heard a metallic rapping through the fabric of his space armor. Then\nsunlight glittered, and the valley filled with a fierce glare, and a man\nin a human spacesuit stood on the _Niccola's_ plating, opposite the\nPlumie air lock. He held a bulky object under his arm. With his other\ngauntlet he rapped again.\n\n\"You fool!\" shouted Baird. \"Stop that! We couldn't use their ship,\nanyhow!\"\n\nHis space phone had turned on with the air supply. Taine's voice snarled:\n\n\"_We'll try! You keep back! They are not human!_\"\n\nBut Baird ran toward him. The sensation of running upon magnetic-soled\nshoes was unearthly: it was like trying to run on fly-paper or\nbird-lime. But in addition there was no gravity here, and no sense of\nbalance, and there was the feeling of perpetual fall.\n\nThere could be no science nor any skill in an encounter under such\nconditions. Baird partly ran and partly staggered and partly skated to\nwhere Taine faced him, snarling. He threw himself at the other man--and\nthen the sun vanished behind the bronze ship's hull, and only stars moved\nvisibly in all the universe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the sound of his impact was loud in Baird's ears inside the suit.\nThere was a slightly different sound when his armor struck Taine's, and\nwhen it struck the heavier metal of the two ships. He fought. But the\nsuits were intended to be defense against greater stresses than human\nblows could offer. In the darkness, it was like two blindfolded men\nfighting each other while encased in pillows.\n\nThen the sun returned, floating sedately above the valley, and Baird\ncould see his enemy. He saw, too, that the Plumie air lock was now open\nand that a small, erect, and somehow jaunty figure in golden space armor\nstood in the opening and watched gravely as the two men fought.\n\nTaine cursed, panting with hysterical hate. He flung himself at Baird,\nand Baird toppled because he'd put one foot past the welded boundary\nbetween the _Niccola's_ cobalt steel and the Plumie ship's bronze. One\nfoot held to nothing. And that was a ghastly sensation, because if Taine\nonly rugged his other foot free and heaved--why--then Baird would go\nfloating away from the rotating, now-twinned ships, floating farther and\nfarther away forever.\n\nBut darkness fell, and he scrambled back to the _Niccola's_ hull as a\ndisorderly parade of stars went by above him. He pantingly waited fresh\nattack. He felt something--and it was the object Taine had meant to offer\nas a return present to the Plumies. It was unquestionably explosive,\neither booby-trapped or timed to explode inside the Plumie ship. Now it\nrocked gently, gripped by the magnetism of the steel.\n\nThe sun appeared again, and Taine was yards away, crawling and fumbling\nfor Baird. Then he saw him, and rose and rushed, and the clankings of his\nshoe-soles were loud. Baird flung himself at Taine in a savage tackle.\n\nHe struck Taine's legs a glancing blow, and the cobalt steel held his\narmor fast, but Taine careened and bounced against the round bronze wall\nof the Plumie, and bounced again. Then he screamed, because he went\nfloating slowly out to emptiness, his arms and legs jerking\nspasmodically, while he shrieked ...\n\nThe Plumie in the air lock stepped out. He trailed a cord behind him. He\nleaped briskly toward nothingness.\n\nThere came quick darkness once more, and Baird struggled erect despite\nthe adhesiveness of the _Niccola's_ hull. When he was fully upright, sick\nwith horror at what had come about, there was sunlight yet again, and men\nwere coming out of the _Niccola's_ air lock, and the Plumie who'd leaped\nfor space was pulling himself back to his own ship again. He had a loop\nof the cord twisted around Taine's leg. But Taine screamed and screamed\ninside his spacesuit.\n\nIt was odd that one could recognize the skipper even inside space armor.\nBut Baird felt sick. He saw Taine received, still screaming, and carried\ninto the lock. The skipper growled an infuriated demand for details. His\nspace phone had come on, too, when its air supply began. Baird explained,\nhis teeth chattering.\n\n\"_Hah!_\" grunted the skipper. \"_Taine was a mistake. He shouldn't ever\nhave left ground. When a man's potty in one fashion, there'll be cracks\nin him all over. What's this?_\"\n\nThe Plumie in the golden armor very soberly offered the skipper the\nobject Taine had meant to introduce into the Plumie's ship. Baird said\ndesperately that he'd fought against it, because he believed it a booby\ntrap to kill the Plumies so men could take their ship and fill it with\nair and cut it free, and then make a landing somewhere.\n\n\"_Damned foolishness!_\" rumbled the skipper. \"_Their ship'd begin to\ncrumble with our air in it! If it held to a landing--_\"\n\nThen he considered the object he'd accepted from the Plumie. It could\nhave been a rocket war head, enclosed in some container that would\ndetonate it if opened. Or there might be a timing device. The skipper\ngrunted. He heaved it skyward.\n\nThe misshapen object went floating away toward emptiness. Sunlight smote\nharshly upon it.\n\n\"_Don't want it back in the _Niccola__,\" growled the skipper, \"_but just to\nmake sure--_\"\n\nHe fumbled a hand weapon out of his belt. He raised it, and it spurted\nflame--very tiny blue-white sparks, each one indicating a pellet of metal\nflung away at high velocity.\n\nOne of them struck the shining, retreating container. It exploded with a\nmonstrous, soundless, violence. It had been a rocket's war head. There\ncould have been only one reason for it to be introduced into a Plumie\nship. Baird ceased to be shaky. Instead, he was ashamed.\n\nThe skipper growled inarticulately. He looked at the Plumie, again\nstanding in the golden ship's air lock.\n\n\"_We'll go back, Mr. Baird. What you've done won't save our lives, and\nnobody will ever know you did it. But I think well of you. Come along!_\"\n\nThis was at 11 hours 5 minutes ship time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA good half hour later the skipper's voice bellowed from the speakers all\nover the _Niccola_. His heavy-jowled features stared doggedly out of\nscreens wherever men were on duty or at ease.\n\n\"_Hear this!_\" he said forbiddingly. \"_We have checked our course and\nspeed. We have verified that there is no possible jury-rig for our\nengines that could get us into any sort of orbit, let alone land us on\nthe only planet in this system with air we could breathe. It is\nofficially certain that in thirteen days nine hours from now, the _Niccola_\nwill be so close to the sun that her hull will melt down. Which will be\nno loss to us because we'll be dead then, still going on into the sun to\nbe vaporized with the ship. There is nothing to be done about it. We can\ndo nothing to save our own lives!_\"\n\nHe glared out of each and every one of the screens, wherever there were\nmen to see him.\n\n\"_But_,\" he rumbled, \"_the Plumies can get away if we help them. They\nhave no cutting torches. We have. We can cut their ship free. They can\nrepair their drive--but it's most likely that it'll operate perfectly\nwhen they're a mile from the _Niccola's_ magnetic field. They can't help\nus. But we can help them. And sooner or later some Plumie ship is going\nto encounter some other human ship. If we cut these Plumies loose,\nthey'll report what we did. When they meet other men, they'll be cagey\nbecause they'll remember Taine. But they'll know they can make friends,\nbecause we did them a favor when we'd nothing to gain by it. I can offer\nno reward. But I ask for volunteers to go outside and cut the Plumie ship\nloose, so the Plumies can go home in safety instead of on into the sun\nwith us!_\"\n\nHe glared, and cut off the image.\n\nDiane held tightly to Baird's hand, in the radar room. He said evenly:\n\n\"There'll be volunteers. The Plumies are pretty sporting\ncharacters--putting up a fight with an unarmed ship, and so on. If there\naren't enough other volunteers, the skipper and I will cut them free by\nourselves.\"\n\nDiane said, dry-throated:\n\n\"I'll help. So I can be with you. We've got--so little time.\"\n\n\"I'll ask the skipper as soon as the Plumie ship's free.\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said Diane. And she pressed her face against his shoulder, and\nwept.\n\nThis was at 01 hours, 20 minutes ship time. At 03 hours even, there was\npeculiar activity in the valley between the welded ships. There were men\nin space armor working cutting-torches where for twenty feet the two\nships were solidly attached. Blue-white flames bored savagely into solid\nmetal, and melted copper gave off strangely colored clouds of\nvapor--which emptiness whisked away to nothing--and molten iron and\ncobalt made equally lurid clouds of other colors.\n\nThere were Plumies in the air lock, watching.\n\nAt 03 hours 40 minutes ship time, all the men but one drew back. They\nwent inside the _Niccola_. Only one man remained, cutting at the last\nsliver of metal that held the two ships together.\n\nIt parted. The Plumie ship swept swiftly away, moved by the centrifugal\nforce of the rotary motion the joined vessels had possessed. It dwindled\nand dwindled. It was a half mile away. A mile. The last man on the\noutside of the _Niccola's_ hull thriftily brought his torch to the air\nlock and came in.\n\nSuddenly, the distant golden hull came to life. It steadied. It ceased to\nspin, however slowly. It darted ahead. It checked. It swung to the right\nand left and up and down. It was alive again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the radar room, Diane walked into Baird's arms and said shakily:\n\n\"Now we ... we have almost fourteen days.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" he commanded. \"When the Plumies understood what we were doing,\nand why, they drew diagrams. They hadn't thought of cutting free, out in\nspace, without the spinning saws they use to cut bronze with. But they\nasked for a scanner and a screen. They checked on its use. I want to\nsee--\"\n\nHe flipped on the screen. And there was instantly a Plumie looking\neagerly out of it, for some sign of communication established. There were\nsoprano sounds, and he waved a hand for attention. Then he zestfully held\nup one diagram after another.\n\nBaird drew a deep breath. A very deep breath. He pressed the\nnavigation-room call. The skipper looked dourly at him.\n\n\"_Well?_\" said the skipper forbiddingly.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Baird, very quietly indeed, \"the Plumies are talking by\ndiagram over the communicator set we gave them. Their drive works.\nThey're as well off as they ever were. And they've been modifying their\ntractor beams--stepping them up to higher power.\"\n\n\"_What of it?_\" demanded the skipper, rumbling.\n\n\"They believe,\" said Baird, \"that they can handle the _Niccola_ with\ntheir beefed-up tractor beams.\" He wetted his lips. \"They're going to tow\nus to the oxygen planet ahead, sir. They're going to set us down on it.\nThey'll help us find the metals we need to build the tools to repair the\n_Niccola_, sir. You see the reasoning, sir. We turned them loose to\nimprove the chance of friendly contact when another human ship runs into\nthem. They want us to carry back--to be proof that Plumies and men can be\nfriends. It seems that--they like us, sir.\"\n\nHe stopped for a moment. Then he went on reasonably;\n\n\"And besides that, it'll be one hell of a fine business proposition. We\nnever bother with hydrogen-methane planets. They've minerals and\nchemicals we haven't got, but even the stones of a methane-hydrogen\nplanet are ready to combine with the oxygen we need to breathe! We can't\ncarry or keep enough oxygen for real work. The same thing's true with\nthem on an oxygen planet. We can't work on each other's planets, but we\ncan do fine business in each other's minerals and chemicals from those\nplanets. I've got a feeling, sir, that the Plumie cairns are\nlocation-notices; markers set up over ore deposits they can find but\ncan't hope to work, yet they claim against the day when their scientists\nfind a way to make them worth owning. I'd be willing to bet, sir, that\nif we explored hydrogen planets as thoroughly as oxygen ones, we'd find\ncairns on their-type planets that they haven't colonized yet.\"\n\nThe skipper stared. His mouth dropped open.\n\n\"And I think, sir,\" said Baird, \"that until they detected us they thought\nthey were the only intelligent race in the galaxy. They were upset to\ndiscover suddenly that they were not, and at first they'd no idea what\nwe'd be like. But I'm guessing now, sir, that they're figuring on what\nchemicals and ores to start swapping with us.\" Then he added, \"When you\nthink of it, sir, probably the first metal they ever used was\naluminum--where our ancestors used copper--and they had a beryllium age\nnext, instead of iron. And right now, sir it's probably as expensive for\nthem to refine iron as it is for us to handle titanium and beryllium and\nosmium--which are duck soup for them! Our two cultures ought to thrive as\nlong as we're friends, sir. They know it already--and we'll find it out\nin a hurry!\"\n\nThe skipper's mouth moved. It closed, and then dropped open again. The\nsearch for the Plumies had been made because it looked like they had to\nbe fought. But Baird had just pointed out some extremely commonsense\nitems which changed the situation entirely. And there was evidence that\nthe Plumies saw the situation the new way. The skipper felt such enormous\nrelief that his manner changed. He displayed what was almost effusive\ncordiality--for the skipper. He cleared his throat.\n\n\"_Hm-m-m. Hah! Very good, Mr. Baird_,\" he said formidably. \"_And of\ncourse with time and air and metals we can rebuild our drive. For that\nmatter, we could rebuild the _Niccola_! I'll notify the ship's company, Mr.\nBaird. Very good!_\" He moved to use another microphone. Then he checked\nhimself. \"_Your expression is odd, Mr. Baird. Did you wish to say\nsomething more?_\"\n\n\"Y-yes, sir,\" said Baird. He held Diane's hand fast. \"It'll be months\nbefore we get back to port, sir. And it's normally against regulations,\nbut under the circumstances ... would you mind ... as skipper ...\nmarrying Lieutenant Holt and me?\"\n\nThe skipper snorted. Then he said almost--almost--amiably;\n\n\"Hm-m-m. You've both done very well, Mr. Baird. Yes. Come to the\nnavigation room and we'll get it over with. Say--ten minutes from now.\"\n\nBaird grinned at Diane. Her eyes shone a little.\n\nThis was at 04 hours 10 minutes ship time. It was exactly twelve hours\nsince the alarm-bell rang.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n[Transcriber's note:\n\nThe following typographical errors have been corrected:\n    \"congenial\" to \"congenital\"\n    \"Mircowaves\" to \"Microwaves\"\n    \"undoutbedly\" to \"undoubtedly\" (twice)\n    \"seemd\" to \"seemed\"\n    \"Lieutenant Hold\" to \"Lieutenant Holt\"\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Aliens, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ALIENS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24104.txt or 24104.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/1/0/24104/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht, Louise Pryor and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
