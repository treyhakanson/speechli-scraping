That is\nthe only real difference between the astounding and the\ncommonplace--Time.\n\nTo-morrow, more astounding things are going to happen. Your children--or\ntheir children--are going to take a trip to the moon. They will be able\nto render themselves invisible--a problem that has already been partly\nsolved. They will be able to disintegrate their bodies in New York and\nreintegrate them in China--and in a matter of seconds.\n\nAstounding? Indeed, yes.\n\nImpossible? Well--television would have been impossible, almost\nunthinkable, ten years ago.\n\nNow you will see the kind of magazine that it is our pleasure to offer\nyou beginning with this, the first number of ASTOUNDING STORIES.\n\nIt is a magazine whose stories will anticipate the super-scientific\nachievements of To-morrow--whose stories will not only be strictly\naccurate in their science but will be vividly, dramatically and\nthrillingly told.\n\nAlready we have secured stories by some of the finest writers of fantasy\nin the world--men such as Ray Cummings, Murray Leinster, Captain S. P.\nMeek, Harl Vincent, R. F. Starzl and Victor Rousseau.\n\nSo--order your next month's copy of ASTOUNDING STORIES in advance!\n\n--_The Editor._\n\n\n\n\nThe Beetle Horde\n\nA TWO-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Victor Rousseau_\n\n\n[Illustration: _Dodd and Tommy realised that they were powerless against\nthe monstrous beetles._]\n\n[Sidenote: Only two young explorers stand in the way of the mad Bram's\nhorrible revenge--the releasing of his trillions of man-sized beetles\nupon an utterly defenseless world.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_Dodd's Discovery_\n\n\nOut of the south the biplane came winging back toward the camp, a black\nspeck against the dazzling white of the vast ice-fields that extended\nunbroken to the horizon on every side.\n\nIt came out of the south, and yet, a hundred miles further back along\nthe course on which it flew, it could not have proceeded in any\ndirection except northward. For a hundred miles south lay the south\npole, the goal toward which the Travers Expeditions had been pressing\nfor the better part of that year.\n\nNot that they could not have reached it sooner. As a matter of fact,\nthe pole had been crossed and re-crossed, according to the estimate of\nTommy Travers, aviator, and nephew of the old millionaire who stood\nfairy uncle to the expedition. But one of the things that was being\nsought was the exact site of the pole. Not within a couple of miles or\nso, but within the fraction of an inch.\n\nIt had something to do with Einstein, and something to do with\nterrestrial magnetism, and the variations of the south magnetic pole,\nand the reason therefore, and something to do with parallaxes and the\nprecession of the equinoxes and other things, this search for the pole's\nexact location. But all that was principally the affair of the\nastronomer of the party. Tommy Travers, who was now evidently on his way\nback, didn't give a whoop for Einstein, or any of the rest of the stuff.\nHe had been enjoying himself after his fashion during a year of\nfrostbites and hard rations, and he was beginning to anticipate the\ndelights of the return to Broadway.\n\nCaptain Storm, in charge of the expedition, together with the five\nothers of the advance camp, watched the plane maneuver up to the tents.\nShe came down neatly on the smooth snow, skidded on her runners like an\nexpert skater, and came to a stop almost immediately in front of the\nmarquee.\n\nTommy Travers leaped out of the enclosed cockpit, which, shut off by\nglass from the cabin, was something like the front seat of a limousine.\n\n\"Well, Captain, we followed that break for a hundred miles, and there's\nno ground cleft, as you expected,\" he said. \"But Jim Dodd and I picked\nup something, and Jim seems to have gone crazy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough the windows of the cabin, Jim Dodd, the young archaeologist of\nthe party, could be seen apparently wrestling with something that looked\nlike a suit of armor. By the time Captain Storm, Jimmy, and the other\nmembers of the party had reached the cabin door, Dodd had got it open\nand flung himself out backward, still hugging what he had found, and\nmaneuvering so that he managed to fall on his back and sustain its\nweight.\n\n\"Say, what the--what--what's that?\" gasped Storm.\n\nEven the least scientific minded of the party gasped in amazement at\nwhat Dodd had. It resembled nothing so much as an enormous beetle. As a\nmatter of fact, it was an insect, for it had the three sections that\ncharacterize this class, but it was merely the shell of one. Between\nfour and five feet in height, when Dodd stood it on end, it could now be\nseen to consist of the hard exterior substance of some huge, unknown\ncoleopter.\n\nThis substance, which was fully three inches thick over the thorax,\nlooked as hard as plate armor.\n\n\"What is it?\" gasped Storm again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy Travers made answer, for James Dodd was evidently incapable of\nspeech, more from emotion than from the force with which he had landed\nbackward in the snow.\n\n\"We found it at the pole, Captain,\" he said. \"At least, pretty near\nwhere the pole ought to be. We ran into a current of warm air or\nsomething. The snow had melted in places, and there were patches of bare\nrock. This thing was lying in a hollow among them.\"\n\n\"If I didn't see it before my eyes, I'd think you crazy, Tommy,\" said\nStorm with some asperity. \"What is it, a crab?\"\n\n\"Crab be damned!\" shouted Jim Dodd, suddenly recovering his faculties.\n\"My God, Captain Storm, don't you know the difference between an insect\nand a crustacean? This is a fossil beetle. Don't you see the\ndistinguishing mark of the coleoptera, those two elytra, or wing-covers,\nwhich meet in the median dorsal line? A beetle, but with the shell of a\ncrustacean instead of mere chitin. That's what led you astray, I expect.\nGod, what a tale we'll have to tell when we get back to New York! We'll\ndrop everything else, and spend years, if need be, looking for other\nspecimens.\"\n\n\"Like fun you will!\" shouted Higby, the astronomer of the party. \"Lemme\ntell you right here, Dodd, nobody outside the Museum of Natural History\nis going to care a damn about your old fossils. What we're going to do\nis to march straight to the true pole, and spend a year taking\nobservations and parallaxes. If Einstein's brochure, in which he links\nup gravitation with magnetism, is correct--\"\n\n\"Fossil beetles!\" Jim Dodd burst out, ignoring the astronomer. \"That\nmeans that in the Tertiary Era, probably, there existed forms of life in\nthe antarctic continent that have never been found elsewhere. Imagine a\nworld in which the insect reached a size proportionate to the great\nsaurians, Captain Storm! I'll wager poor Bram discovered this. That's\nwhy he stayed behind when the Greystoke Expedition came within a hundred\nmiles of the pole. I'll wager he's left a cairn somewhere with full\ndetails inside it. We've got to find it. We--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Jim Dodd, suddenly realizing that the rest of the party could hardly\nbe said to share his enthusiasm in any marked degree, broke off and\nlooked sulky.\n\n\"You say you found this thing pretty nearly upon the site of the true\npole?\" Captain Storm asked Tommy.\n\n\"Within five miles, I'd say, Captain. The fog was so bad that we\ncouldn't get our directions very well.\"\n\n\"Well, then, there's going to be no difficulty,\" answered Storm. \"If\nthis fair weather lasts, we'll be at the pole in another week, and we'll\nstart making our permanent camp. Plenty of opportunity for all you\ngentlemen. As for me, I'm merely a sailor, and I'm trying to be\nimpartial.\n\n\"And please remember, gentlemen, that we're well into March now, and\nlikely to have the first storms of autumn on us any day. So let's drop\nthe argument and remember that we've got to pull together!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy Travers was the only skilled aviator of the expedition, which had\nbrought two planes with it. It was a queer friendship that had sprung up\nbetween him and Jim Dodd. Tommy, the blas\u00e9 ex-Harvard man, who was known\nalong Broadway, and had never been able to settle down, seemed as\ndifferent as possible from the spectacled, scholarly Dodd, ten years his\nsenior, red-haired, irascible, and living, as Tommy put it, in the Age\nof Old Red Sandstone, instead of in the year 1930 A. D.\n\nIt was generally known--though the story had been officially\ndenied--that there had been trouble in the Greystoke Expedition of three\nyears before. Captain Greystoke had taken the brilliant, erratic Bram,\nof the Carnegie Archaeological Institute, with him, and Bram's history\nwas a long record of trouble.\n\nIt was Bram who had exploded the faked neolithic finds at Mannheim,\nthereby earning the undying enmity of certain European savants, but\nbrilliantly demolishing them when he smashed the so-called Mannheim\nstone pitcher (valued at a hundred thousand dollars) with a pocket-axe,\nand caustically inquired whether neolithic man used babbit metal rivets\nto fasten on his jug handles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram's brilliant work in the investigation of the origin of the negrito\nAsiatic races had been awarded one of the Nobel prizes, and Bram had\ndeclined it in an insulting letter because he disapproved of the year's\nprize award for literature.\n\nHe had been a storm center for years, embittered by long opposition,\nwhen he joined the Greystoke Expedition for the purpose of investigating\nthe marine fauna of the antarctic continent.\n\nAnd it was known that his presence had nearly brought the Greystoke\nExpedition to the point of civil war. Rumor said he had been\ndeliberately abandoned. His enemies hoped he had. The facts seemed to\nbe, however, that in an outburst of temper he had walked out of camp in\na furious snowstorm and perished. For days his body had been sought in\nvain.\n\nJimmy Dodd had run foul of Bram some years before, when Bram had\npublished a criticism of one of Dodd's addresses dealing with fossil\nmonotremes, or egg-laying mammals. In his inimitable way, Bram had\nsuggested that the problem which came first, the egg or the chicken, was\nnow seen to be linked up with the Darwinian theory, and solved in the\nperson of Dodd.\n\nNevertheless, Jimmy Dodd entertained a devoted admiration for the memory\nof the dead scientist. He believed that Bram must have left records of\ninestimable importance in a cairn before he died. He wanted to find that\ncairn.\n\nAnd he knew, what a number of Bram's enemies knew, that the dead\nscientist had been a morphine addict. He believed that he had wandered\nout into the snow under the influence of the drug.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodd, who shared a tent with Tommy, had raved the greater part of the\nnight about the find.\n\n\"Well, but see here, Jimmy, suppose these beetles did inhabit the\nantarctic continent a few million years ago, why get excited?\" Tommy had\nasked.\n\n\"Excited?\" bellowed Dodd. \"It opens one of the biggest problems that\nscience has to face. Why haven't they survived into historic times? Why\ndidn't they cross into Australia, like the opossum, by the land bridge\nthen existent between that continent and South America? Beetles five\nfeet in length, and practically invulnerable! What killed them off? Why\ndidn't they win the supremacy over man?\"\n\nJimmy Dodd had muttered till he went to sleep, and he had muttered\nworse in his dreams. Tommy was glad that Captain Storm had given them\npermission to return to the same spot next morning and look for further\nfossils, though his own interest in them was of the slightest.\n\nThe dogs were being harnessed next morning when the two men hopped into\nthe plane. The thermometer was unusually high for the season, for in the\nsouth polar regions the short summer is usually at an end by March.\nTommy was sweating in his furs in a temperature well above the freezing\npoint. The snow was crusted hard, the sky overcast with clouds, and a\nwind was blowing hard out of the south, and increasing in velocity\nhourly.\n\n\"A bad day for starting,\" said Captain Storm. \"Looks like one of the\nautumn storms was blowing up. If I were you, I'd watch the weather,\nTommy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy glanced at Dodd, who was huddled in the rear cockpit, fuming at\nthe delay, and grinned whimsically. \"I guess I can handle her, Captain,\"\nhe answered. \"It's only an hour's flight to where he found that fossil.\"\n\n\"Just as you please,\" said Storm curtly. He knew that Tommy's judgment\nas a pilot could always be relied upon. \"You'll find us here when you\nreturn,\" he added. \"I've counter-manded the order to march. I don't like\nthe look of the weather at all.\"\n\nTommy grinned again and pressed the starter. The engine caught and\nwarmed up. One of the men kicked away the blocks of ice that had been\nplaced under the skids to serve as chocks. The plane taxied over the\ncrusted snow, and took off into the south.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe camp was situated in a hollow among the ice-mountains that rose to a\nheight of two or three thousand feet all around. Tommy had not dreamed\nhow strongly the gale was blowing until he was over the top of them.\nThen he realized that he was facing a tougher proposition than he had\ncalculated on. The storm struck the biplane with full force.\n\nA snowstorm was driving up rapidly, blackening the sky. The sun, which\nonly appeared for a brief interval every day, was practically touching\nthe horizon as it rose to make its minute arc in the sky. A star was\nvisible through a rift in the clouds overhead, and the pale daylight in\nwhich they had started had already become twilight.\n\nTommy was tempted to turn back, but it was only a hundred miles, and\nJimmy Dodd would give him no peace if he did so. So he put the plane's\nnose resolutely into the wind, watching his speed indicator drop from a\nhundred miles per hour to eighty, sixty, forty--less.\n\nThe storm was beating up furiously. Of a sudden the clouds broke into a\ndeluge of whirling snow.\n\nIn a moment the windshield was a frozen, opaque mass. Tommy opened it,\nand peered out into the biting air. He could see nothing.... The plane,\ncaught in the fearful cross-currents that swirl about the southern roof\nof the world, was fluttering like a leaf in the wind. The altimeter was\ndropping dangerously.\n\nTommy opened the throttle to the limit, zooming, and, like a spurred\nhorse, the biplane shot forward and upward. She touched five thousand,\nsix, seven--and that, for her, was ceiling under those conditions, for a\nsudden tremendous shock of wind, coming in a fierce cross-current, swung\nher round, tossed her to and fro in the enveloping white cloud. And\nTommy knew that he had the fight of his life upon his hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe compasses, which required considerable daily adjusting to be of use\nso near to the pole, had now gone out of use altogether. The air speed\nindicator had apparently gone west, for it was oscillating between zero\nand twenty. The turn and bank indicator was performing a kind of tango\nround the dial. Even the eight-day clock had ceased to function, but\nthat might have been due to the fact that Tommy had neglected to wind\nit. And the oil pressure gauge presented a still more startling sight,\nfor a glance showed that either there was a leak or else the oil had\nfrozen.\n\nTommy looked around at Dodd and pointed downward. Dodd responded with a\nvicious forward wave of his hand.\n\nTommy shook his head, and Dodd started forward along the cabin,\napparently with the intention of committing assault and battery upon\nhim. Instead, the archaeologist collapsed upon the floor as the plane\nspun completely around under the impact of a blast that was like a\ngiant's slap.\n\nThe plane was no longer controllable. True, she responded in some sort\nto the controls, but all Tommy was able to do was to keep her from going\ninto a crazy sideslip or nose dive as he fought with the elements. And\nthose elements were like a devil unchained. One moment he was dropping\nlike a plummet, the next he was shooting up like a rocket as a vertical\nblast of air caught the plane and tossed her like a cork into the\ninvisible heavens. Then she was revolving, as if in a maelstrom, and by\ndegrees this rotary movement began to predominate.\n\nRound and round went the plane, in circles that gradually narrowed, and\nit was all Tommy could do to swing the stick so as to keep her from\nskidding or sideslipping. And as he worked desperately at his task Tommy\nbegan to realize something that made him wonder if he was not dreaming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe snow was no longer snow, but rain--mist, rather, warm mist that had\nalready cleared the windshield and covered it with tiny drops.\n\nAnd that white, opaque world into which he was looking was no longer\nsnow but fog--the densest fog that Tommy had ever encountered.\n\nFog like white wool, drifting past him in fleecy flakes that looked as\nif they had solid substance. Warm fog that was like balm upon his frozen\nskin, but of a warmth that was impossible within a few miles of the\nfrozen pole.\n\nThen there came a momentary break in it, and Tommy looked down and\nuttered a cry of fear. Fear, because he knew that he must be dreaming.\n\nNot more than a thousand feet beneath him he saw patches of snow, and\npatches of--green grass, the brightest and most verdant green that he\nhad ever seen in his life.\n\nHe turned round at a touch on his shoulder. Dodd was leaning over him,\none hand pointing menacingly upward and onward.\n\n\"You fool,\" Tommy bellowed in his ear, \"d'you think the south pole lies\nover there? It's here! Yeah, don't you get it, Jimmy? Look down! This\nvalley--God, Jimmy, the south pole's a hole in the ground!\"\n\nAnd as he spoke he remembered vaguely some crank who had once insisted\nthat the two poles were hollow because--what was the fellow's reasoning?\nTommy could not remember it.\n\nBut there was no longer any doubt but that they were dropping into a\nhole. Not more than a mile around, which explained why neither Scott nor\nAmundsen had found it when they approximated to the site of the pole. A\nhole--a warm hole, up which a current of warm air was rushing, forming\nthe white mist that now gradually thinned as the plane descended. The\nplateau with its covering of eternal snows loomed in a white circle high\noverhead. Underneath was green grass now--grass and trees!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fog was nearly gone. The plane responded to the controls again.\nTommy pushed the stick forward and came round in a tighter circle.\n\nAnd then something happened that he had not in the least expected. One\nmoment he seemed to be traveling in a complete calm, a sort of clear\nfunnel with a ring of swirling fog outside it--the next he was dropping\ninto a void!\n\nThere was no air resistance--there seemed hardly any air, for he felt a\nchoking in his throat, and a tearing at his lungs as he strove to\nbreathe. He heard a strangled cry from Dodd, and saw that he was\nclutching with both hands at his throat, and his face was turning\npurple.\n\nThe controls went limp in Tommy's hands. The plane, gyrating more\nslowly, suddenly nosed down, hung for a moment in that void, and then\nplunged toward the green earth, two hundred feet below, with appalling\nswiftness.\n\nTommy realized that a crash was inevitable. He threw his goggles up over\nhis forehead, turned and waved to Dodd in ironic farewell. He saw the\nearth rush up at him--then came the shattering crash, and then oblivion!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Beetles and Humans_\n\n\nHow long he had remained unconscious, Tommy had no means of determining.\nOf a sudden he found himself lying on the ground beside the shattered\nplane, with his eyes wide open.\n\nHe stared at it, and stared about him, without understanding where he\nwas, or what had happened to him. His first idea was that he had crashed\non the golf links near Mitchell Field, Long Island, for all about him\nwere stretches of verdant grass and small shrubby plants. Then, when he\nremembered the expedition, he was convinced that he had been dreaming.\n\nWhat brought him to a saner view was the discovery that he was enveloped\nin furs which were insufferably hot. He half raised himself and\nsucceeded in unfastening his fur coat, and thus discovered that\napparently none of his bones was broken.\n\nBut the plane must have fallen from a considerable height to have been\nsmashed so badly. Then Tommy discovered that he was lying upon an\nextensive mound of sand, thrown up as by some gigantic mole, for burrow\ntracks ran through it in every direction. It was this that had saved his\nlife.\n\nSomething was moving at his side. It was half-submerged in the\nsand-pile, and it was moving parallel to him with great rapidity.\n\nA grayish body, half-covered with grains of sand emerged, waving two\nenormously long tentacles. It was a shrimp, but fully three feet in\nlength, and Tommy had never before had any idea what an unpleasant\nobject a shrimp is.\n\nTommy staggered to his feet and dropped nearer the plane, eyeing the\nshrimp with horror. But he was soon relieved as he discovered that it\nwas apparently harmless. It slithered away and once more buried itself\nin the pile of sand.\n\nNow Tommy was beginning to remember. He looked into the wreckage of the\nplane. Jim Dodd was not there. He called his name repeatedly, and there\nwas no response, except a dull echo from the ice-mountains behind the\nveil of fog.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went to the other side of the plane, he scanned the ground all about\nhim. Jimmy had disappeared. It was evident that he was nowhere near, for\nTommy could see the whole of the lower scope of the bowl on every side\nof him. He had walked away--or he had been carried away! Tommy thought\nof the shrimp, and shuddered. What other fearsome monsters might inhabit\nthat extraordinary valley?\n\nHe sat down, leaning against the wreck of the fuselage, and tried to\nadjust his mind, tried to keep himself from going mad. He knew now that\nthe flight had been no dream, that he was a member of his uncle's\nexpedition, that he had flown with Jim toward the pole, had crashed in a\nvacuum. But where was Jim? And how were they going to get out of the\ndamn place?\n\nSomething like a heap of stones not far away attracted Tommy's\nattention. Perhaps Jim Dodd was lying behind that. Once more Tommy got\nupon his feet and began walking toward it. On the way, he stumbled\nagainst the sharp edge of something that protruded from the ground.\n\nIt cut his leg sharply, and, with a curse, he began rubbing his shin and\nlooking at the thing. Then he saw that it was another of the fossil\nshells, half-buried in the marshy ooze on which he was treading. The\nground in this lower part of the valley was a swamp, on account of the\nvery fine mist falling from the fog clouds that surrounded it\nimpenetrably on every side.\n\nThen Tommy came upon another shell, and then another. And now he saw\nthat there were piles of what he had taken to be rock everywhere, and\nthat this was not rock but great heaps of the shells, all equally\nintact.\n\nHundreds of thousands of the prehistoric beetles must have died in that\nvalley, perhaps overcome by some cataclysm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy examined the heap near which he stood; he yelled Dodd's name, but\nagain no answer came.\n\nInstead, something began to stir among the heaps of shells. For a moment\nTommy hoped against hope that it was Dodd, but it wasn't Dodd.\n\n_It was a living beetle!_\n\nA beetle fully five feet high as it stood erect, a pair of enormous\nwings outspread. And the head, which was larger than a man's, was the\nmost frightful object Tommy had ever seen.\n\nJim Dodd would have said at once that this was one of the Curculionidae,\nor snout beetles, for a prolongation of the head between the eyes formed\na sort of beak a foot in length. The mouth, which opened downward, was\narmed with terrific mandibles, while the huge, compound eyes looked like\nenormous crystals of cut glass. Immediately in front of the eyes were\ntwo mandibles as long as a man's arms, with feathery processes at the\nends. In addition to these there were three pairs of legs, the front\npair as long as a man's, the hind pair almost as long as a horse's.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nParalyzed with horror, Tommy watched the monster, which had apparently\nbeen disturbed by the vibrations of his voice, extract itself from among\nthe shells. Then, with a bound that covered fifteen feet, it had\nlessened the distance between them by half.\n\nAnd then a still more amazing thing happened. For of a sudden the hard\nshell slipped from the thorax, the wing-cases dropped off, the whole of\nthe bony parts slipped to the ground with a clang, and a soft,\ndefenseless thing went slithering away among the rocks.\n\nThe beetle had moulted!\n\nTommy dropped to the ground in the throes of violent nausea.\n\nThen, looking up again, he saw the girl!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was about a hundred yards away from him, very close to the fallen\nplane, and she must have emerged from a large hole in the ground which\nTommy could now see under a ledge of overhanging rock.\n\nShe seemed to be dressed in a single garment which fell to her knees,\nand appeared to fit tightly about her body, but as she came nearer,\nTommy, watching her, petrified by this latest apparition, discovered\nthat it was woven of her own hair, which must have been of immense\nlength, for it fell naturally to her shoulders, and thence was woven\ninto this close-fitting material, a fringe an inch or two in length\nextending beneath the selvage.\n\nShe was about six feet tall, and apparently made after the normal human\npattern. She moved with a slow, majestic swing, and if ever any female\nhad seemed to Tommy to have the appearance of an angel, this unknown\nwoman did.\n\nShe was so fair, in that flossy, flaxen covering, she moved with such\neasy grace, that Tommy, gaping, gradually crept nearer to her. She did\nnot seem to see him. She was stooping over the very sand heap into which\nhe had fallen. Suddenly, with lightning-like rapidity, her arms shot\nout, her hands began tunneling in the sand. With a cry of triumph she\npulled out the shrimp Tommy had seen, or another like it, and, stripping\nit off the shell, began devouring it with evident relish.\n\nIn the midst of her meal the girl raised her head and looked at Tommy.\nHe saw that her eyes were filmed, vacant, dead. Then of a sudden a third\nmembrane was drawn back across the pupils, and she saw him.\n\nShe let the shrimp drop to the ground, uttered a cry, and moved toward\nhim with a tottering gait. She groped toward him with outstretched arms.\nAnd then she was blind again, for the membrane once more covered her\npupils. It was as if her eyes were unable to endure even the dim light\nof the valley, through whose surrounding mists the low sun, setting just\nabove the horizon, was unable to diffuse itself save as a brightening of\nthe fog curtain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy stepped toward the girl. His outstretched hand touched hers. It\nwas unquestionably a woman's hand he held, delicately warm, with\nexquisitely moulded fingers, in whose touch there seemed to be, for the\ngirl, some tactile impression of him.\n\nAgain that membrane was drawn back from the girl's pupils for a fleeting\nflash. Tommy saw two eyes of intense black, their color contrasting\ncuriously with the flaxen color of her hair and her white skin, almost\nthe tint of an albino's. Those eyes had surveyed him, and appeared\nsatisfied that he was one of her kind. She could not have seen very much\nin that almost instantaneous flash of vision. Queer, that membrane--as\nif she had been used to living in the dark, as if the full light of the\nday was unbearable!\n\nShe drew her hand away. Soft vocals came from her lips. Suddenly she\nturned swiftly. She could not have seen, but before Tommy had seen, she\nhad sensed the presence of the old man who was creeping out of the hole\nin the mountainside.\n\nHe moved forward craftily, and then pounced upon the sand pile, and in a\nmoment had pulled out another of the big shrimps, which he proceeded to\ndevour with greedy relish. The girl, leaving Tommy's side, joined him in\nthat unpleasant feast.\n\nAnd in the midst of it a flood came pouring from the hole--a flood of\nliving beetles, covering the ground in fifteen-foot leaps as they dashed\nat the two.\n\nTo his horror, Tommy saw Jimmy Dodd among them, wrapped in his fur coat\nlike a mummy, and being pushed and rolled forward like a football.\n\nFor a moment Tommy hesitated, torn between his solicitude for Jim Dodd\nand that for the girl. Then, as the foremost of the monsters bounded to\nher side, he ran between them. The vicious jaws snapped within six\ninches of Tommy's face, with a force that would have carried away an\near, or shredded the cheek, if they had met.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy struck out with all his might, and his fist clanged on the\nresounding shell so that the blood spurted from his bruised knuckles. He\nhad struck the monster squarely upon the thorax, and he had not\ndiscommoded it in the least. It turned on him, its glassy, many-faceted\neyes glaring with a cold, infernal light. Tommy struck out again with\nhis left hand, this time upon the pulpy flesh of the downward-opening\nmouth.\n\nAn inch higher, and he would have impaled his hand upon the beak, with a\npoint like a needle, and evidently used for purposes of attack, since it\nwas not connected with the mandibles. The blow appeared to fall in the\nonly vulnerable place. The monster dropped upon its back and lay there,\nunable to reverse itself, its antenna and forelegs waving in the air,\nand the rear legs rasping together in a shrill, strident shriek.\n\nInstantly, as Tommy darted out of the way, the swarm fell upon the\nhelpless monster and began devouring it, tearing strips of flesh from\nthe lower shell, which in the space of a half-minute was reduced simply\nto bone. The most horrible feature of this act of cannibalism was the\ncomplete silence with which it was performed, except for the rasping of\nthe dying monster's legs. It was evident that the huge beetles had no\nvocal apparatus.\n\nFor the moment left unguarded, Jim Dodd flung down the collar of his fur\ncoat, stared about him, and recognized Tommy.\n\n\"My God, it's you!\" he yelled. \"Well, can you--?\"\n\nHe had no time to finish his sentence. A pair of antenna went round his\nneck from behind. At the same instant Tommy, the old man, and the girl\nwere gripped by the monsters, which, forming a solid phalanx about them,\nbegan hustling them in the direction of the hole. Resistance was utterly\nimpossible. Tommy felt as if he was being pushed along by a moving wall\nof stone.\n\nInside the opening it was completely dark. Tommy shouted to Dodd, but\nthe strident sounds of the moving legs drowned his cries. He was being\npushed forward into the unknown.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly the ground seemed to fall away beneath his feet. He struggled,\ncried out, and felt himself descending through the air.\n\nFor a full half-minute he went downward at a speed that constricted his\nthroat so that he could hardly draw breath. Then, just as he had nerved\nhimself for the imminent crash, the speed of his descent was checked. In\nanother moment he found that he was slowing to a standstill in mid-air.\n\nHe was beginning to float backward--upward. But the wall of moving\nshells, pushing against him, forced him on, downward, and yet apparently\nagainst the force of gravitation.\n\nThen of a sudden Tommy was aware of a dim light all about him. His feet\ntouched earth and grass as softly as a thistledown alighting.\n\nHe found himself seated in the same dim light upon red grass, and\nstaring into Jimmy's face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Ten Miles Underground_\n\n\n\"What I was going to say when we were interrupted, was, 'Can you beat\nit?'\" Jimmy Dodd observed, with admirable sang-froid.\n\nThey were still seated on the red grass, gazing about them at what\nlooked like an illimitable plain, and upward into depths of darkness. It\nwas warm, and the light, furnished by what appeared to be luminous\nvegetation, was about that of twilight.\n\nOn every side were clumps of trees and shrubs, which formed centers of\nphosphorescent illumination, but for the most part the land was open,\nand here and there human figures appeared, moving with head down and\narms hanging earthward.\n\n\"No, I'm damned if I can,\" said Tommy. \"What happened to you after we\ncrashed?\"\n\n\"Why, first thing I knew, I found myself riding on the back of a fossil\nbeetle, apparently one of the _curculionidae_,\" said Dodd.\n\n\"Never, mind being so precise, Jimmy. Let's call it a beetle. Go on.\"\n\n\"They set me down inside the hole and seemed to be investigating me,\nthe whole swarm of them. Of course, I thought I was dead, and come to\nmy just reward, especially when I saw those beaks. Then one of them\nbegan tickling my face with its antenna, and I drew up my fur collar.\nThey didn't seem to like the feel of the fur, and after a while the\nwhole gang started hustling me back again, like a nest of ants carrying\nsomething they don't want outside their hill. And then you bobbed up.\"\n\n\"Well, my opinion is you saved your life by pulling up your collar,\"\nsaid Tommy. \"Looks to me as if it's a case of the survival of the\nfittest, said fittest being the insect, and the human race taking second\nplace. You know what the humans here live on, don't you?\"\n\n\"No, what?\"\n\n\"Shrimps as big as poodles. If you'd seen that girl and the old man\ngetting outside them, you'd realize that there seems to be a food\nshortage in this part of the world. Say, where in thunder are we,\nJimmy?\"\n\n\"Haven't you guessed yet, Travers?\" asked Dodd, a spice of malice in his\nvoice.\n\n\"I suppose this is some sort of big hole on the site of the south pole,\nwith warm vapors coming up. Maybe a great fissure in the earth, or\nsomething.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJimmy Dodd's grin, seen in the half-light, was rather disconcerting.\n\"How far do you think we dropped just now?\" Dodd asked.\n\n\"Why, I'd say several hundred yards,\" replied Tommy. \"What's your\nestimate?\"\n\n\"Just about ten miles,\" answered Dodd.\n\n\"What? You're still crazy! Why, we slowed up!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" grinned Dodd, \"we slowed up. We're inside the crust of the\nworld. That's the long and short of it. The earth we've known is just a\nshell over our heads.\"\n\n\"Yeah? Walking head downward, are we? Then why don't we drop to the\ncenter of the earth, you damn fool?\"\n\n\"Because, my dear fellow, you can swing a pailful of water round your\nhead without spilling any of it. In other words, our old friend,\ncentrifugal force. The speed with which the earth is rotating, keeps us\non our feet, head downward. To be precise, the center of the earth's\ngravity lies in the middle of the hollow sphere, of course, but the\ncounteraction of centrifugal force throws it outward to the middle of\nthe ten-mile crust. That's why we slowed down after we were half-way\nthrough. We were moving against gravity.\"\n\n\"And what's up there, or down there, or whatever you call it?\" asked\nTommy, pointing to what ought to have been the sky.\n\n\"Nothing. It's the center of the tennis ball, though I imagine it's\npretty near a vacuum when you get up a mile or so, owing to the speed of\nthe earth's rotation, which forces the heat into the shell.\"\n\n\"You mean to say you actually believe that stuff you've been handing\nme?\" asked Tommy, after a pause. \"Then how did human beings get here,\nand those damn beetles? And why's the grass red?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The grass is red because there's no sunlight to produce chlorophyll.\nThe inhabitants of the deep sea are red or black, almost invariably. In\nthe case of the humans, they've become bleached. My belief is that that\nman and woman we saw, and those\"--he pointed to the vague forms of human\nbeings, who moved across the grass, gathering something--\"are survivors\nof the primitive race that still exists as the Australians. Undoubtedly\none of the branches of the human stock originated in antarctica at a\ntime when it enjoyed a tropical temperature, and was the land bridge\nbetween Australia and South America.\"\n\n\"And the--beetles?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"Ah, they go back to the days when nature was in a more grandiose\nmood!\" replied the archaeologist enthusiastically. \"That's the most\nwonderful discovery of the ages. The world will go crazy over them when\nwe bring back the first living specimens to the zoological parks of the\ngreat cities.\n\n\"But,\" Dodd went on, speaking with still more enthusiasm, \"of course,\nthis is only the beginning, Tommy. There are ten million species of\ninsects, according to Riley, and it is inevitable that there must be\nhundreds of thousands of other survivals from the age of the great\nsaurians, perhaps even some of the saurians themselves. Who knows but\nthat we may discover the ancestor of the extinct monotremes, the\nrhynchocephalia, the pterodactyls, hatch a brood of aepyornis eggs--\"\n\n\"And,\" said Tommy tartly, \"how are we going to get them back, apart from\nthe little problem of getting out of here ourselves?\"\n\n\"Don't let's worry about that now,\" answered Dodd. \"It will take ten\nyears of the hardest kind of labor even to begin a classification of the\ninhabitants of this inner world. I could sit down for ever, and--\"\n\nBut Jimmy Dodd rose to his feet as a pair of antenna whipped round his\nneck and jerked him bodily upward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the monster beetles was standing upright behind them, and by its\ngestures it evidently meant that Dodd and Tommy were to join the crowd\nof humans in the offing. As Dodd turned upon it with an indignant show\nof fists, one of the antennae whipped off his fur coat and stung him\npainfully with the bristle-like attachment at the end.\n\nIt was a painful moment when Dodd and Tommy realized that they were\npowerless against the monstrous beetles. Tommy tried the uppercut with\nwhich he had knocked out the deceased monster, but the quick jerks of\nthe present beetle's head were infinitely faster than the movements of\nhis fists, while the antenna had a whiplike quality about them that\nspeedily convinced him that discretion was the card to play.\n\nUnder the threat of the curling antenna, Tommy and Dodd moved in the\ndirection of the slowly circulating humans. Numerous tiny rodents, which\nevidently kept the red grass short, scampered away under their feet. The\nbeetles made no further effort to force them on, but now they could see\nthat a number of the monsters were stationed at intervals around a wide\ncircle, keeping the humans in a single body.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" ejaculated Tommy, stopping. \"See what they're doing, Dodd?\nThey're herding us, like cowboys herd steers. Look at that!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the herd, a male with a long beard, suddenly broke from the herd,\nbawling, and flung himself upon a beetle guard. The antenna shot forth,\ncoiled around his neck, and hurled him a dozen feet to the ground, where\nhe lay stunned for a moment before arising and rejoining his companions.\n\n\"But what are they looking for?\" demanded Dodd.\n\nTommy had not heard him. He had stopped in front of one of the luminous\ntrees and was plucking a fruit from it.\n\n\"Jimmy, ever see an apple before?\" he asked. \"If this isn't an apple,\nI'll eat my head.\"\n\nIt certainly was an apple, and one of the largest and juiciest that\nTommy had ever tasted. It was the reddest apple he had ever seen, and\nwould have won the first prize at any agricultural fair.\n\n\"And look at this!\" shouted Tommy, plucking an enormous luminous peach\nfrom another tree.\n\nThey began munching slowly, then, seeing one of the beetle guards\napproaching them, they moved into the midst of the crowd.\n\n\"Did you notice anything strange about those fruit trees?\" inquired\nDodd, as he munched. \"I'll swear they were monocotyledonous, which,\nafter all, is what one would expect. Still, to think that the\nmonocotyledons evolved the familiar drupes, or stone fruits, on a\nparallel line to the dicotyledons is--amazing!\"\n\nA box on the ear like the kick of a mule's hoof jerked the last word\nfrom his lips as he went sprawling. He got up, to see the girl standing\nbefore him, intense disgust and anger on her face.\n\nShe snatched the fruits from the hands of the two Americans and hurled\nthem away. It was evident from her manner that she considered such diet\nin the highest degree unclean and disgusting; also that she considered\nherself charged with the duty of superintending Tommy's and Dodd's\neducation, but especially Dodd's.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaking him by the arm, she propelled him into the midst of the groping\nhumans. She released him, stooped, and suddenly stood up, a shrimp about\neighteen inches long in her hand.\n\nTowering over Dodd by six inches, she took his face in her hands and\nbegan caressing him; then, seizing his jaws in her strong fingers, she\npried them apart, and popped the tail end of the shrimp into his mouth.\n\nDodd let out a yelp, and spat out the love-gift, to be rewarded with\nanother box on the ear by the young Amazon, while Tommy stood by,\nconvulsed with laughter, and yet in considerable trepidation, for fear\nof being forced to share Dodd's fate.\n\nFor the girl was again holding out the tail end of the crustacean, and\nJim Dodd's jaws were slowly and reluctantly approaching it.\n\nBut suddenly there came an intervention as the strident rasping of\nbeetle legs was heard in the distance. Panic seized the human herd,\ngrovelling for shrimps in the sandy soil with its tufts of red grasses.\nMilling in an uneasy mob, they cowered under the lashes of the antenna\nof the beetle guards, which sacrificed their backs through their hair\ngarments whenever any of them tried to bolt.\n\nNearer and nearer came the beetles, louder and more penetrating the\nshriek of their rasping legs. Now the swarm came into sight, rank after\nrank of the shell-clad monsters, leaping fifteen feet at a bound with\nperfect precision, until they had formed a solid phalanx all around the\nhumans.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy heard sighs of despair, he heard muttering, and then he realized,\nwith deep thankfulness, that these human beings, degraded though they\nwere, had a speech of their own.\n\nIn the middle of the front line appeared a beetle a foot taller than the\nrest. That it was either a king or queen was evident from the respect\npaid it by the rest of the swarm. At its every movement a bodyguard of\nbeetles moved in unison, forming themselves in a group before it and on\neither side.\n\nThere would have been something ludicrous about these movements, but for\nthe impression of horror that the swarm made upon Tommy and Jim Dodd.\nHitherto both had supposed that the hideous insects acted by blind\ninstinct, but now there could no longer be any doubt that they were\npossessed of an organized intelligence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe strident sounds grew louder. Already Tommy was beginning to discover\ncertain variations in them. It was dawning upon him that they formed a\nlanguage--and a perfectly intelligible one. For, as the note changed\nabout a half-semitone, two of the monsters left the side of their ruler\nand reached the two men with three successive leaps.\n\nTheir movements left no doubt in either Tommy's or Dodd's mind what was\nrequired. The two strode hastily toward the assemblage, and stopped as\nthe antenna of their guards came down in menacing fashion.\n\nIt was light enough for Tommy to see the face of the ruler of the\nhellish swarm. And it required all his powers of will to keep from\ncollapsing from sheer horror at what he saw.\n\nFor, despite the close-fitting shell, the face of the beetle king was\nthe face of a man--a white man!\n\nJim Dodd's shriek rang out above the shrilling of the beetle-legs,\n\"Bram! It's you, it's you! My God, it's you, Bram!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Bram's Story_\n\n\nA sneering chuckle broke from Bram's lips. \"Yes, it's me, James Dodd,\"\nhe answered. \"I'm a little surprised to see you here, Dodd, but I'm\nmighty glad. Still insane upon the subject of fossil monotremes, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nThe words came haltingly from Bram's lips, as from those of a man who\nhad lost the habit of easy speech. And Tommy, looking on, and trying to\nkeep in possession of his faculties, had already come to the conclusion\nthat the sounds were inaudible to the beetles. Probably their hearing\napparatus was not attuned to such slow vibrations of the human voice.\n\nAlso he had discovered that Bram was wearing the discarded shell of one\nof the monsters: he had not grown the shell himself. It was fastened\nabout his body by a band of the hair-cloth, fastened to the two\nprotuberances of the elytra, or wing-cases, on either side of the dorsal\nsurface.\n\nThe discovery at least robbed the situation of one aspect of terror.\nBram, however he had obtained control of the swarm, was still only a\nman.\n\n\"Yes, still insane,\" answered Dodd bitterly. \"Insane enough to go on\nbelieving that the polyprotodontia and the dasyuridae, which includes\nthe peramelidae, or bandicoots, and the banded ant-eaters, or\nmyrmecobidae, are not to be found in fossil form, for the excellent\nreason that they were not represented before the Upper Cretaceous\nperiod.\"\n\n\"You lie! You lie!\" screamed Bram. \"I have shown to all the world that\nphascalotherium, amphitherium, amblotherium, spalacotherium, and many\nother orders are to be found in the Upper Jurassic rocks of England,\nWyoming, and other places. You--you are the man who denied the existence\nof the nototherium, of the marsupial lion, in pleistocene deposits! You\ndenied that the dasyuridae can be traced back beyond the pleistocene.\nAnd you stand there and lie to me, when you are at my mercy!\"\n\n\"For God's sake don't aggravate him,\" whispered Tommy to Dodd. \"Don't\nyou see that he's insane? Humor him, or we'll be dead men. Think what\nthe world will lose, if you are never able to go back with your\nspecimens,\" he added craftily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Dodd, whose eyes were glaring, said a sublime thing: \"I have given\nmy life to science, and I will never deny my master!\"\n\nWith a screech, which, however, was evidently inaudible to the beetles,\nBram leaped at Dodd and seized him by the throat. The two men fell to\nthe ground, the ponderous beetle-shell completely covering them.\nUnderneath it they could be seen to be struggling desperately. All the\nwhile the beetle horde remained perfectly motionless. Tommy thought\nafterward that in this fact lay their brightest chances of escape, if\nBram's immediate vengeance did not fall on them.\n\nEither because Bram was not himself a beetle, or because in some other\nway the swarm instinct was not stirred, the monsters watched the\nstruggle with complete indifference.\n\nAt the moment, however, Tommy was only concerned with saving Dodd from\nthe madman. He got his foot beneath the shell, then inserted his leg;\nusing his whole body as a lever, he succeeded in turning Bram over on\nhis back.\n\nThen, and only then, the swarm rushed in upon them. Then Tommy realized\nthat he had touched one of the triggers that regulated the beetle's\nautomatism. In another instant Bram would have been torn to pieces. The\nneedle-beaks were darting through the air, the hideous jaws were\nsnapping. Bram's yells rang through the cavern.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodging beneath the avalanche of the monsters, Tommy got Bram upon his\nfeet again. The beetles stopped, every movement arrested. Bram's hand\nwent to the pocket of his tattered coat, there came a snap, a flash.\nBram had ignited an automatic cigarette-lighter!\n\nInstantly the monsters went scurrying away into the distance. And Tommy\nhad another clue. The beetles, living in the dimness of the underworld,\ncould not stand light or fire!\n\nHe ran to where Jimmy was lying, face upward, on the ground. His face\nwas badly scarred by Bram's nails, and the blood was spurting from a\nlong gash in his throat, made by the sharp flint that was lying beside\nhim.\n\nHe had some time before discarded his fur coat. Now he pulled off his\ncoat, and, tearing off the tail of his shirt, he made a pad and a\nbandage, with which he attempted to staunch the blood and bind the\nwound. It must have taken ten minutes before the failing heart force\nenabled him to get the bleeding under control. Dodd had nearly bled to\ndeath, his face was drawn and waxen, but, because the pulsation was so\nfeeble, the artery had ceased to spurt.\n\nThen only did Tommy take notice of Bram. He had been squatting near, and\nTommy realized that he had unconsciously observed Bram put some sort of\npellets into his mouth. Now he realized that Bram was a drug fiend. That\nwas what had made him walk out of the Greystoke camp in the storm.\n\nBram got up and came toward them. \"Is he dead?\" he whispered hoarsely.\n\"I--I lost my temper. You two--I don't intend to kill you.\nThere--there's room for the three of us. I've got--plans of the utmost\nimportance to humanity.\"\n\n\"I don't think much of the way you've started to carry them out,\"\nanswered Tommy bitterly. \"No, he's not dead yet, but I wouldn't give\nmuch for his chances, even in the best hospital. The best thing you can\ndo now is to go to hell, and take your beetles with you,\" he added.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram, without replying, raised his head and emitted from his throat the\nshrillest whistle that Tommy had ever heard. The response was amazing.\n\nRasping out of the darkness came eight beetles in pairs. Instead of\nleaping from an upright position, they trotted in the manner of horses,\non all fours, their shells, which touched at the edges, forming a solid\nsurface, gently rounded in the center so that a man's body could lie\nthere and fit snugly into the groove.\n\n\"Help me get him up,\" said Bram. \"Trust me! I'll do my best for him. If\nwe leave him here they may kill and eat him. I can't trust all those\nbeetle guards.\"\n\nTommy hesitated a moment, then decided to follow Bram's suggestion.\nTogether they raised the unconscious man to the beetle-shell couch. Bram\nseated himself upon the boss of one of the beetle-shells in front, and\nTommy jumped up behind.\n\nNext moment, to his amazement, the trained steeds were flying smoothly\nthrough the air, at a rate that could not have been less than\nseventy-five to eighty miles an hour.\n\nTommy's shell seat was not a bed of roses, but he hardly noticed that.\nHe was thinking that if Dodd lived they should be able to turn the\ntables.\n\nFor, unknown to Bram, he was in possession of the cigarette-lighter\nwhich he had picked up, and which Bram, in his agitation, had\nforgotten. It was full of petrol, or some other fluid of a similar\nnature, which Bram must have obtained from some natural source within\nthe earth. And, in an emergency, Tommy knew that he had the means of\nkeeping the beetles at bay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had traveled for perhaps an hour when a faint light began to glow\nin the distance. It grew brighter, and a roaring sound became audible. A\nturn of the track that they were traversing, and the light became a\nglare. A terrific sight met Tommy's eyes.\n\nOut of the bowels of the earth--actually out of the crust beneath their\nfeet--there shot a pillar of roaring flame, of intense white color, and\nradiating a heat that was perceptible even at a distance of several\nhundred yards. The beetle steeds dropped gently to the ground; they\nhalted. Bram got down, grinning.\n\n\"Nicely trained horses, what?\" he asked. \"By the way, you have the\nadvantage of me in names. Who and what are you?\"\n\nTommy told him.\n\n\"Well, Travers, it looks as if we're going to be companions for some\ntime to come, and I quite admit you saved my life back there. So we\ndon't want to start with secrets. This is a natural petrol spring, which\nhas probably been burning undiminished for ages. My trained beetles are\nblind--you didn't happen to notice I'd cut off their antenna? But the\nrest of the swarm daren't come near it. So that makes me their master.\n\n\"Pretty trick, what, Travers? I'm the Lord of the Flame down here, and\nI'm using my advantage. But don't get the idea of supplanting me. There\nare lots of other tricks you don't know anything about, and I'll have to\ntrust you better before--\"\n\nHe broke off and slipped another pellet into his mouth.\n\n\"Help me get Dodd down, if this is our destination,\" answered Tommy.\n\nThey lifted Dodd to the ground. He was conscious now, and moaning for\nwater. The two men carried him into a sort of large cavern, at the\nfarther end of which the fire was roaring. Bram went to a spring that\ntrickled down one side, filled something that looked like a petrified\nlily calyx, and brought it to Dodd, who drained it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy looked about him. He was astonished to see that the place was, in\na way, furnished. Bram had carved out a very creditable couch, and\nseveral low chairs, evidently with a stone ax, for by the light of the\nfire, which cast a fair illumination even at that distance, Tommy could\nsee the marks of the implement, rough and irregular, in the wood.\n\nOn the ground were thick rugs, woven of hair, and two or three more rugs\nof the same material lay on the couch. It was evident that the human\nherd was expected to furnish textile materials as well as meat.\n\n\"Sit down, and make yourself comfortable,\" said Bram, when they had\nraised Dodd to the couch. \"We'll have dinner, and then we'll talk. I can\ngive you a fine vegetarian meal. Those dirty shrimp-eating savages look\non me as a cannibal because I eat the fruits of the trees.\" He grinned.\n\"There's a bad shortage of food in Submundia, as I've named this part of\nthe world,\" he went on, \"for until I came the beetles simply devoured\nthe humans wholesale, instead of breeding them, like I taught them. And\nthere's another of the hundred-and-fifty year swarms due to hatch out\nsoon. However, we'll talk about that later. And all those fine fruits\ngoing to waste! Excuse me, Travers.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe disappeared, and returned in a minute or two with a small table,\npiled high with luscious fruits unknown to Tommy, though among them were\nsome that looked like loaves of natural bread.\n\nTommy, whose appetite never failed him even in the worst circumstances,\nfell to with a will. He was enjoying his meal when he happened to look\nup, and saw that the penumbra at the edge of the lighted zone was dense\nwith beetles.\n\nThousands--perhaps millions, for they stretched away as far as the eye\ncould see, were packed together, their antenna waving in unison, their\nheads, beneath the shells, directed toward the fire.\n\nBram saw Tommy's look of disgust, and laughed. \"The fire seems to\nintoxicate them, Travers,\" he said. \"They always throng the entrance\nwhen I'm here. It's as far as they dare go. They're quite blind in the\nleast light. Care to smoke? I've learned the art of making some quite\ndecent cigars.\" He produced a handful. \"Oh, by the way, you didn't see\nmy lighter anywhere, did you?\" he went on, with a pretense of\ncarelessness.\n\n\"No,\" lied Tommy. \"I was surprised you--\"\n\n\"Oh, there's a supply of petrol in the rocks. No matter,\" answered Bram\ncarelessly. \"Your friend looks bad,\" he added, glancing at Dodd, who had\nfallen asleep. \"Travers, I'm sorry I lost my temper. The--the shock of\nmeeting men from the upper world, you know.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodd opened his eyes and tried to whisper. Tommy bent over him and\nlistened.\n\n\"He wants to know whether he can have that girl to take care of him,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"What, the one I saw you with? Why, she's a cull, Travers.\"\n\n\"What d'you mean?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"Why--useless, you know. There's several of them running loose, and\nwaiting to be rounded up. We raise two breeds, one for replenishing the\nstock, and one for meat. She's just a cull, a reversion, no use for\neither purpose. I'll have her brought by all means. I--I like Dodd. I\nwant to get him to like me,\" Bram went on, with a sort of penitence\nthat had a pathetic touch. \"Our little differences--quite absurd, and I\ncan prove he's wrong in his ideas.\n\n\"Make yourself comfortable as long as you're here, Travers, and don't\nmind me. Only, don't try to escape. The beetles will get you if you do,\nand there's no way out of here--none that you'll find. And don't try to\nfollow me. But you're a sensible man, and we'll all get along famously,\nI'm sure, as soon as Dodd recovers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Doomed!_\n\n\nThere were no means known to Tommy of reckoning time in that strange\nplace of twilight. His watch had been broken in the airplane fall; and\nDodd never remembered to wind his, but they estimated that about two\nweeks had passed, judging from the number of times they had slept and\neaten.\n\nIn those two weeks they had gradually begun to grow accustomed to their\nsurroundings. Haidia, the girl, had arrived on beetle-back within an\nhour after Bram's departure, apparently into a cleft of the rocks--how\nhe had communicated his order to the beetle steeds Tommy had no idea.\nAnd under the girl's ministrations Dodd was making good progress toward\nrecovery.\n\nThat Haidia was in love with Dodd in quite a human way was evident. To\nplease the girl, both Dodd and Tommy had learned to eat the raw shrimps,\nwhich, being bloodless, were really no worse than oysters, and had a\nflavor half-way between shrimp and crawfish. To please the men, Haidia\ntried not to shudder when she saw them devouring the breadfruit and\nnectarines of which Bram always had a plentiful supply. Bram was\nsolicitous in his inquiries for Dodd's health.\n\n\"Jim, I've been thinking about our chances of getting away,\" said Tommy\none morning. \"It's evident Bram's only waiting for your recovery to put\nsome proposition up to us. Suppose you were to feign paralysis.\"\n\n\"How d'you mean? What for?\" demanded Dodd.\n\n\"If he thinks you're helpless, he'll be less on his guard. You haven't\nwalked about in his presence.\" That was true, for the activities of the\ntwo had been nocturnal, when Bram had vanished. \"Let him think a nerve's\nbeen severed in your neck, or something of the sort. If it doesn't work,\nyou can always get better.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDodd's realistic portrayal of a man with a partly paralyzed right side\nbrought cries of horror from Bram next morning. Solicitously he helped\nDodd back to the couch. Bram, when not under the influence of his drug,\nhad moments of human feeling.\n\n\"Can't you move that arm and leg at all, Dodd?\" he asked. \"No feeling in\nthem?\"\n\n\"There's plenty of feeling,\" growled Dodd, \"but they don't seem to work,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"You'll get better,\" said Bram eagerly. \"You must get better. I need\nyou, Dodd, in spite of our differences. There's work for all of us,\nwonderful work. A new humanity, waiting to be born, Dodd, not of the\nmiserable ape race, but of--of--\"\n\nHe checked himself, and a cunning look came over his face. He turned\naway abruptly.\n\nAt the end of two weeks or so, an amazing thing happened. One day\nHaidia, with a look of triumph in her eyes, addressed Dodd with a few\nEnglish words!\n\nHer brain, which had probably developed certain faculties in different\nproportions from those of the upper human race, had registered every\nword that either of the two men had ever spoken, and remembered it. As\nsoon as Dodd ascertained this, he began to instruct her, and, with her\nabnormal faculties of memory, it was not long before she could talk\nquite intelligently. The obstacle that had stood between them was swept\naway. She became one of themselves.\n\nIn the days that followed the girl told them brokenly something of the\nhistory of her race, of the legend of the universal flood that had\ndriven them down into the bowels of the earth, of the centuries-long\nstruggle with the beetles, and of the insects' gradual conquest of\nhumanity, and the final reduction of the human race to a miserable,\nhelpless remnant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverywhere, Haidia told them, were beetle swarms, everywhere humanity\nhad been reduced to a few handfuls. Bram, by breeding mankind from\nprolific strains, and using the new-born progeny for food, had\ntemporarily averted universal starvation. But a new swarm of beetles was\ndue to hatch out shortly, and then--\n\nThe girl, with a shudder, put her hand to her bosom, and brought out a\nlittle bright-eyed lizard.\n\n\"The old man you saw with me, who is one of our wise elders, has told\nour people that these things feed upon the beetle larvae,\" she said. \"We\nare putting them secretly into the nests. But what can a few lizards do\nagainst millions.\" She looked up. \"In the earth above us, the beetle\nlarvae extend for miles, in a solid mass,\" she said. \"When they come out\nas beetles, it will be the end of all of us.\"\n\nBram had grown less suspicious as the time passed. His sudden visits to\nthe cavern had ceased. Dodd and Tommy knew that he spent the nights--if\nthey could be termed nights--lying in a drugged slumber somewhere among\nthe rocks. They had asked Haidia whether there was any way of escape\ninto the upper world.\n\n\"There are two ways from here,\" answered the girl. \"One is the way you\ncame, but it is impossible to pass the beetle guards without being torn\nto pieces. The other--\"\n\nShe shuddered, and for an instant drew back the film from across her\npupils, then uttered a little cry of pain at the light, dim though it\nwas.\n\n\"There is a bridge across that terrible monster that devours all it\ntouches,\" she said, shuddering, meaning the fire.\n\nSuddenly Dodd had an inspiration. He still had the fur coat that he had\nworn, and, reaching into a pocket he drew out a pair of snow goggles,\nwhich he adjusted over Haidia's nose.\n\n\"Now look!\" he said.\n\nHaidia looked, blinked and, with an effort kept her eyes open. She gazed\nat Dodd in amazement. Dodd laughed, and pulled her toward him. He kissed\nher, and Haidia's eyes closed.\n\n\"What is this?\" she murmured. \"First you give me medicine that opens my\neyes, and then you give me medicine that closes them.\"\n\n\"That's nothing,\" grinned Dodd. \"Wait till you understand me better.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram's eyes were preternaturally bright. It was evident that he had been\nincreasing his dose of late, and that he was fully under the influence\nof it now.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, the time has come for us to be frank with one\nanother,\" he said, as the three were gathered about the little table,\nwhile Haidia crouched in a far corner of the cave. \"I want you to work\nfor me in my plans for the regeneration of humanity. The time for which\nI have long labored is almost at hand. Any day now the new swarm of\nbeetles may emerge from the pupal stage. But before I speak further,\ncome and see them, gentlemen!\"\n\nHe rose, and Dodd and Tommy rose too, Tommy supporting Dodd, who let his\narm and leg trail awkwardly as he moved.\n\nBram led the way into the cleft among the rocks into which he had been\nin the habit of passing. Beyond this opening the two men saw another\nsmaller cavern, with a beetle guard standing on either side, antenna\nwaving.\n\nBram shrilled a sound, and the antenna dropped. The three passed\nthrough. Tommy saw a hair-cloth pallet set against the rocks, a table,\nand a chair. Beyond was a sloping ramp of earth. Overhead was a rock\nceiling.\n\nBram led the way up the ramp, and the three stepped through a gap in the\nrocks and found themselves on an extensive prairie. But in place of the\nred grass there was a vast sea of mud.\n\nBy the light cast by the petrol fire, which roared up in the distance, a\nveritable fiery fountain, the two Americans could see that the mud was\nfilled with huge encysted forms, grubs three or four feet long,\nmotionless in the soil.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram scooped up one of them and tossed it into the air. It thudded to\ntheir feet and remained motionless.\n\n\"As far as you can see, and for miles beyond, these pupae of the beetles\nlie buried in the decaying vegetation in which the eggs were hatched,\"\nsaid Bram. \"Every century and a half, so far as I have been able to\njudge from comparative anatomy, a fresh swarm emerges. See!\"\n\nHe pointed to the pupa he had unearthed, which, as if stirred into\nactivity by his handling, was now beginning to move. Or, rather,\nsomething was moving inside the cocoon.\n\nThe shell broke, and the hideous head and folded antenna of a beetle\nappeared. With a convulsive writhing, the monster threw off the covering\nand stepped out. It extended its wings, glistening, with moisture, from\nthe still soft and pliant carapace, or shell, and suddenly zoomed off\ninto the distance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy shuddered as the boom of its flight grew softer and subsided.\n\n\"Any day now the entire swarm will emerge,\" cried Bram. \"How many\nmoultings they undergo before they undergo the finished state, I do not\nknow, but already, as you see, they are prepared for the battle of\nlife. They emerge ravenous. That beetle will fall upon the man-herds and\ndevour a full grown man, unless the guards destroy it.\"\n\nHe raised his arms with the gesture of an ancient prophet. \"Woe to the\nhuman race,\" he cried, \"the wretched ape spawn that has cast out its\nteachers and persecuted those who sought to raise it to higher things!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy knew that Bram was referring to himself. Bram turned fiercely upon\nDodd.\n\n\"When I joined the Greystoke expedition,\" he cried, \"it was with the\nexpress intention of refuting your miserable theories as to the fossil\nmonotremes. I could not sleep or eat, so deeply was I affronted by them.\nFor, if they were true, the dasyuridae are an innovation in the great\nscheme of nature, and man, instead of being a mere afterthought, a jest\nof the Creative Force, came to earth with a purpose.\n\n\"That I deny,\" he yelled. \"Man is a joke. Nature made him when she was\ntired, as the architect of a cathedral fashions a gargoyle in a sportive\nmoment. It is the insect, not man, who is the predestined lord of the\nages!\"\n\nAnd for once in his life, perhaps because at this point Tommy dug him\nviolently in the ribs, Dodd had the sense to remain silent. Bram led the\nway swiftly back into the larger cave.\n\n\"When this swarm hatches out,\" he said, \"I calculate that there will be\na trillion beetles seeking food. There is no food for a tithe of them\nhere underneath the earth. What then? Do you realize their stupendous\npower, their invincibility?\n\n\"No, you don't realize it, because your minds, through long habit, are\nonly attuned to think in terms of man. All man's long history of\nslaughter of the so-called lower creatures obsesses you, blinds your\nunderstanding. A beetle? Something to be trodden underfoot, crushed in\nsport! But I tell you, gentlemen, that nature--God, if you will--has\ndesigned to supplant the man-ape by the beetle.\n\n\"He has resolved to throw down the wretched so-called intelligence of\nyour kind and mine, and supplant it by the divine instinct of the\nbeetle, an instinct that is infinitely superior, because it arrives at\nresults instantaneously. It knows where man infers. Attuned closely to\nnature, it alone is able to fulfil the divine plan of Creation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBram was certainly under the influence of his drug; nevertheless, so\nviolent were his gestures, so inspired was his utterance, that Tommy and\nDodd listened almost in awe.\n\n\"They are invincible,\" Bram went on. \"Their fecundity is such that when\nthe new swarm is hatched out their numbers alone will make them\nirresistible. They do not know fear. They shrink from nothing. And they\nwill follow me, their leader--I, who know the means of controlling them.\nHow, then, can puny man hope to stand against them?\n\n\"Join me, gentlemen,\" Bram went on. \"And beware how you decide rashly.\nFor this is the supreme moment, not only of your own lives, but for all\nhumanity and beetledom. Upon your decision hangs the future of the\nworld.\n\n\"For, irresistible as the beetles are, there is one thing they lack. That\nis the sense of historic continuity. If they destroy man, they will know\nnothing of man's achievements, poor though these are. My own work on the\nfossil monotremes--\"\n\n\"Which is a tissue of inaccuracies and half-baked deductions!\" shouted\nDodd.\n\nBram started as if a whip had lashed him. \"Liar!\" he bawled. \"Do you\nthink that I, who left the Greystoke expedition in a howling blizzard\nbecause I knew that here, in the inner earth, I could refute your\nmiserable impostures--do you think that I am in the mood to listen to\nyour wretched farrago of impossibilities?\"\n\n\"Listen to me,\" bawled Dodd, advancing with waving arms. \"Once and for\nall, let me tell you that your deductions are all based upon fallacious\npremises. No, I will not shut up, Tom Travers! You want me to aid your\ndamned beetles in the destruction of humanity! I tell you that your\nphascalotherium, amphitherium, and all the rest of them, including the\nmarsupial lion, are degenerate developments of the age following the\npleistocene. I say the whole insect world was made to fertilize the\nplant world, so that it should bear fruit for human food. Man is the\nsummit of the scale of evolution, and I will never join in any infamous\nscheme for his destruction.\"\n\nBram glared at Dodd like a madman. Three times he opened his mouth to\nspeak, but only inarticulate sounds came from his throat. And when at\nlast he did speak, he said something that neither Dodd nor Tommy had\nanticipated.\n\n\"It looks as if you're not so paralysed as you made out,\" he sneered.\n\"You'll change your mind within what used to be called a day, Dodd.\nYou'll crawl to my feet and beg for pardon. And you'll recant your lying\ntheories about the fossil monotremes, or you die--the pair of you--you\ndie!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Escape!_\n\n\n\"I heard what he said. You shall not die. We shall go away to your\nplace, where there are no beetles to eat us, even if\"--Haidia\nshuddered--\"even if we have to cross the bridge of fire, beyond which,\nthey tell me, lies freedom.\"\n\nHigh over and a little to one side of the petrol flame Dodd and Tommy\nhad seen the slender arch of rock leading into another cleft in the\nrocks. They had investigated it several times, but always the fierce\nheat had driven them back.\n\nBoth Dodd and Tommy had noticed, however, that at times the fire seemed\nto shrink in volume and intensity. Observation had shown them that these\ntimes were periodical, recurring about every twelve hours.\n\n\"I think I've got the clue, Tommy,\" said Dodd, as the three watched the\nfiery fountain and speculated on the possibility of escape. \"That flow\nof petrol is controlled, like the tides on earth, by the pull of the\nmoon. Just now it is at its height. I've noticed that it loses pretty\nnearly half its volume at its alternating phase. If I'm right, we'll\nmake the attempt in about twelve hours.\"\n\n\"Bram's given us twenty-four,\" said Tommy. \"But how about getting Haidia\nacross?\"\n\n\"I go where you go,\" said Haidia, sidling up to Dodd and looking down\nupon him lovingly. \"I do not afraid of the fire. If it burn me up, I go\nto the good place.\"\n\n\"Where's that, Haidia?\" asked Dodd.\n\n\"When we die, we go to a place where it is always dark and there are no\nbeetles, and the ground is full of shrimps. We leave our bodies behind,\nlike the beetles, and fly about happy for ever.\"\n\n\"Not a bad sort of place,\" said Dodd, squeezing Haidia's arm. \"If you\nthink you're ready to try to cross the bridge, we'll start as soon as\nthe fire gets lower.\"\n\n\"I'll be on the job,\" answered Haidia, unconsciously reproducing a\nphrase of Tommy's.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl glided away, and disappeared through the thick of the beetle\ncrowd clustered about the entrance to the cavern. Tommy and Dodd had\nalready discovered that it was through her ability to reproduce a\ncertain beetle sound meaning \"not good to eat\" that the girl could come\nand go. They had once tried it on their own account, and had narrowly\nescaped the lashing tentacles.\n\nAfter that there was nothing to do but wait. Three or four hours must\nhave passed when Bram returned from his inner cave.\n\n\"Well, Dodd, have you experienced a change of heart?\" he sneered. \"If\nyou knew what's in store for you, maybe you'd come to the conclusion\nthat you've been too cocksure about the monotremes. We're slaughtering\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"That so?\" asked Dodd.\n\n\"That's so,\" shouted Bram. \"The beetles are beginning to emerge from the\npupae, and they'll need food if they're to be kept quiet. We're rounding\nup about threescore of the culls--your friend Haidia will be among them.\nWe've got some caged ichneumon flies, pretty little things only a foot\nlong, which will sting them in certain nerve centers, rendering them\npowerless to move. Then we shall bury them, standing up, in the\nvegetable mould, for the beetles to devour alive, as soon as they come\nout of the shells. You'll feel pretty, Dodd, standing there unable to\nmove, with the new born beetles biting chunks out of you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy shuddered, despite his hopes of their escaping. Bram, for a\nscientist, had a grim and picturesque imagination.\n\n\"Dodd, there is no personal quarrel between us,\" Bram went on. Again\nthat note of pathetic pleading came into his voice. \"Give up your mad\nideas. Admit that the banded ant-eater, at least, existed before the\npleistocene epoch, and everything can be settled. When you see what my\nbeetles are going to do to humanity, you'll be proud to join us. Only\nmake a beginning. You remember the point I made in my paper, about\nspalacotherium in the Upper Jurassic rocks. It would convince anybody\nbut a hardened fanatic.\"\n\n\"I read your paper, and I saw your so-called spalacotherium,\nreconstructed from what you called a jaw-bone,\" shouted Dodd. \"That\nso-called jaw-bone was a lump of chalk, made porous by water, and the\nrest was in your imagination. Do your worst, Bram, I'll never crucify\ntruth to save my life. And I'll laugh at your spalacotherium when your\nbeetles are eating me.\"\n\nBram yelled and shrieked, he stamped up and down the cavern, shaking his\nfists at Dodd. At last, with a final torrent of objurgation, he\ndisappeared.\n\n\"A pleasant customer,\" said Tommy. \"We'll have to make that bridge, Jim,\nno question about it, even if it means death in the petrol fire.\"\n\n\"Fire's dying down fast,\" answered Dodd. \"Haidia ought to be here soon.\"\n\n\"If Bram hasn't got her.\"\n\n\"Bram got--that girl? If Bram harms a hair of her head I'll kill him\nwith worse tortures than he's ever dreamed of,\" answered Dodd, leaping\nup, white with rage.\n\n\"You mean you--?\" Tommy began.\n\n\"Love her? Yes, I love her,\" shouted Dodd. \"She's a girl in a million.\nJust the sort of helpmate I need to assist me in my work when we get\nback. I tell you, Tommy, I didn't know what love meant before I saw\nHaidia. I laughed at it as a romantic notion. 'Oh lyric love, half angel\nand half bird!'\" he quoted, beginning to stride up and down the cavern,\nwhile Tommy watched him in amazement.\n\nAnd at this moment a complete beetle entered the cave. Complete, because\nit had a plastron, or breast-shell, as well as a back-shell, or\ncarapace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA double breast-shell! A new species of beetle? An executioner beetle,\nsent by Bram to summon them to the torture? Tommy shuddered, but Dodd,\nlost in his love ecstasy, was ignorant of the creature's advent.\n\n\"'Oh lyric love--'\" he shouted again, as he twirled on his heel, to run\nsmack into the monster. The crack of Dodd's head against the\nbeetle-shell re-echoed through the cave.\n\nThe double plastron dropped, the carapace fell down: Haidia stood\nrevealed. The lovers, folded in each other's arms, passed momentarily\ninto a trance.\n\nIt was Tommy who separated them. \"We'll have to make a move,\" he said.\n\"I think the fire's as low as it ever gets. Why did you bring the\nshells, Haidia?\"\n\n\"To save us all from the beetles,\" answered the girl. \"When they see us\nin the shells, they will not know we are human. That is what makes it so\nhard to have to be eaten by those beetles, when they are such\ndumb-bells,\" she added, reproducing another of Tommy's words.\n\n\"Come,\" she continued bravely, \"let us see if we can pass the fire.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe roaring fountain made the air a veritable inferno. Overhead the\nrocks were red-hot. A cascade of sparks tumbled in a fiery shower from\nthe rock roof. Dodd, holding Haidia in his arms, to protect her,\nstaggered ahead, with Tommy in the rear. Only the beetle-shells, which\nacted as non-conductors of the heat, made that fiery passage possible.\n\nThere was one moment when it seemed to Tommy as if he must let go, and\ndrop into that raging furnace underneath. He heard Dodd bawling hoarsely\nin front of him, he nerved himself to a last effort, beating fiercely at\nhis blazing hair--and then the heat was past, and he had dropped\nunconscious upon a bed of cool earth beside a rushing river.\n\nHe was vaguely aware of being carried in Dodd's arms, but a long time\nseemed to have passed before he grew conscious again. He opened his eyes\nin utter darkness. Dodd was whispering in his ear.\n\n\"Tommy, old man, how are you feeling now?\" Dodd asked.\n\n\"All--right,\" Tommy muttered. \"How's Haidia?\"\n\n\"Still unconscious, poor girl. We've got to get out of here. I heard\nBram yelling in the distance. He's discovered our flight. There may be\nanother way out of the cave, and, if so, he'll stop at nothing to get\nus. See if you can stand, but keep your head low. There's a low roof of\nrock above us.\"\n\n\"There's water,\" said Tommy, listening to the roar of a torrent that\nseemed to be rushing past them.\n\n\"It's a stream, and I believe these shells will float and bear our\nweight. We've got to try. We've got to put everything to the touch now,\nTommy. I'm going to lay Haidia on one of the shells, poor girl, and\nstart her off. Then I'll follow, and you can bring up the rear.\"\n\n\"I'm with you,\" said Tommy, getting upon his feet, and uttering an\nexclamation of pain as, forgetful of Dodd's injunction, he let his head\nstrike the rock roof overhead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the darkness he felt the outlines of his beetle-shell lying beside\nthe torrent. He could hear Dodd in front of him, grunting as he raised\nHaidia's unconscious form in his arms and deposited her in her shell.\nTommy got his own shell into the stream, and held it there as the waters\nswirled around it.\n\n\"Ready?\" he heard Dodd call.\n\nBefore he could answer, there sounded from not far away, yet strangely\nmuffled by the rocks, Bram's bellow of fury. Bram was evidently fully\ndrugged and beside himself. Inarticulate threats came floating through\nthe rocky chamber.\n\n\"Bram seems to have lost his head temporarily,\" called Dodd, laughing.\n\"A madman, Tommy. He insists that the marsupial lion--\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard you telling him about it,\" answered Tommy. \"You handed it\nto him straight. However, more about the marsupial lion later. I'm\nready.\"\n\n\"Then let 'er go,\" called Dodd, and his words were swallowed up by the\nsound of the hollow shell striking against the rocky bank as he launched\nhis strange craft into the water.\n\nTommy set one foot into the hollow of his shell, and let himself go.\n\nInstantly the shell shot forward with fearful velocity. It was all Tommy\ncould do to balance himself, for it seemed more unstable than a canoe.\nOnce or twice he thought he heard Dodd shouting ahead of him, but his\ncries were drowned in the rush of the torrent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly a light appeared in the distance. Tommy thought it was another\nof the petroleum fountains, and his heart seemed to stand still. But\nthen he gave a gasp of relief. It was a cluster of luminous fungi, ten\nor twelve feet tall, emitting a glow equal to that of a dozen 40-watt\nelectric bulbs.\n\nBy that infernal light Tommy could see that the stream curved sharply.\nIt was about fifty feet in width, and the low rock roof had receded to\nsome fifteen feet overhead. Instead of a tunnel, there was nothing on\neither side of them but a vast tract of marshy ground thinly coated with\nthe red grass.\n\nAs Tommy looked, he saw the shell that carried the unconscious body of\nHaidia strike the bank beside the phosphorescent growth. He could see\nthe girl lying in the hollow of the shell, as pale as death, her eyes\nclosed. Dodd was close behind. As the swirl of the current caught his\nshell, he turned to shout a warning to Tommy.\n\nAnd Tommy noticed a singular thing, of which his sense of balance had\nalready warned him, though he had hardly given conscious thought to the\nmatter. _The river was running up-hill!_\n\nOf course it was, since the center of gravity was in the shell of the\nearth, and not in the center!\n\nBut, again, the shell of the earth was under their feet!\n\nThen Tommy hit on the solution to the problem. If the river was running\nup-hill, that meant that they must be near the exterior of the earth. In\nother words, they had passed the center of gravity: they must be within\na mile or so of the exit from Submundia!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy was about to shout his discovery to Dodd when his shell grounded\nbeside the two others, at the base of the clump of fungi.\n\nHuge, straight, hollow stems they were, with mushroom caps, and, like\nall fungi, fly-blown, for Tommy could see worms nearly a foot in length\ncrawling in and out of the porous stalks. The stench from the growth was\nnauseating and overpowering, utterly sickening.\n\n\"Push off and let's get out of here!\" Tommy called to Dodd, who was\nbalancing his shell against the bank, and trying to peer into Haidia's\nface.\n\nAt that moment he caught sight of something that made his blood turn\ncold!\n\nIt was an insect fully fifteen feet in height, three times that of a\nbeetle, lurking among the fungi. He saw a hugely elongated neck, a\nthree-cornered head with a pair of tentacles, and two pairs of legs as\nlong as a giraffe's. But what gave the added touch of horror was that\nthe monster, balancing itself on its hind legs, had its forelegs\nextended in the attitude of one holding a prayer-book!\n\nThat attitude of devotion was so terrible that Tommy uttered a wild cry\nof terror. At the same time another cry broke from Dodd's lips.\n\n\"God, a praying mantis!\" he shouted, struggling madly to push off his\nshell and Haidia's.\n\nThe next moment, as if shot from a catapult, the hideous monster\nlaunched itself into the air straight toward them.\n\n(_To be concluded in the February Number._)\n\n\n\n\nThe Cave of Horror\n\n_By Captain S. P. Meek_\n\n[Illustration: \"_Suddenly, for no apparent reason at all, one of the men\non guard was jerked into the air feet upwards._\"]\n\n[Sidenote: Screaming, the guardsman was jerked through the air. An\nunearthly screech rang through the cavern. The unseen horror of Mammoth\nCave had struck again.]\n\n\nDr. Bird looked up impatiently as the door of his private laboratory in\nthe Bureau of Standards swung open, but the frown on his face changed to\na smile as he saw the form of Operative Carnes of the United States\nSecret Service framed in the doorway.\n\n\"Hello, Carnes,\" he called cheerfully. \"Take a seat and make yourself at\nhome for a few minutes. I'll be with you as soon as I finish getting\nthis weight.\"\n\nCarnes sat on the edge of a bench and watched with admiration the long\nnervous hands and the slim tapering fingers of the famous scientist. Dr.\nBird stood well over six feet and weighed two hundred and six pounds\nstripped: his massive shoulders and heavy shock of unruly black hair\ncombined to give him the appearance of a prize-fighter--until one looked\nat his hands. Acid stains and scars could not hide the beauty of those\nmobile hands, the hands of an artist and a dreamer. An artist Dr. Bird\nwas, albeit his artistry expressed itself in the most delicate and\ncomplicated experiments in the realms of pure and applied science that\nthe world has ever seen, rather than in the commoner forms of art.\n\nThe doctor finished his task of weighing a porcelain crucible, set it\ncarefully into a dessicator, and turned to his friend.\n\n\"What's on your mind, Carnes?\" he asked. \"You look worried. Is there\nanother counterfeit on the market?\"\n\nThe operative shook his head.\n\n\"Have you been reading those stories that the papers have been carrying\nabout Mammoth Cave?\" he asked.\n\nDr. Bird emitted a snort of disgust.\n\n\"I read the first one of them part way through on the strength of its\nbeing an Associated Press dispatch,\" he replied, \"but that was enough.\nIt didn't exactly impress me with its veracity, and, from a viewpoint of\nliterature, the thing was impossible. I have no time to pore over the\nlucubrations of an inspired press agent.\"\n\n\"So you dismissed them as mere press agent work?\"\n\n\"Certainly. What else could they be? Things like that don't happen\nfortuitously just as the tourist season is about to open. I suppose that\nthose yarns will bring flocks of the curious to Kentucky though: the\npublic always responds well to sea serpent yarns.\"\n\n\"Mammoth Cave has been closed to visitors for the season,\" said Carnes\nquietly.\n\n\"What?\" cried the doctor in surprise. \"Was there really something to\nthose wild yarns?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There was, and what is more to the point, there still is. At least\nthere is enough to it that I am leaving for Kentucky this evening, and I\ncame here for the express purpose of asking you whether you wanted to\ncome along. Bolton suggested that I ask you: he said that the whole\nthing sounded to him like magic and that magic was more in your line\nthan in ours. He made out a request for your services and I have it in\nmy pocket now. Are you interested?\"\n\n\"How does the secret service cut in on it?\" asked the doctor. \"It seems\nto me that it is a state matter. Mammoth Cave isn't a National Park.\"\n\n\"Apparently you haven't followed the papers. It _was_ a state matter\nuntil the Governor asked for federal troops. Whenever the regulars get\ninto trouble, the federal government is rather apt to take a hand.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that regulars had been sent there. Tell me about the\ncase.\"\n\n\"Will you come along?\"\n\nDr. Bird shook his head slowly.\n\n\"I really don't see how I can spare the time, Carnes,\" he said. \"I am in\nthe midst of some work of the utmost importance and it hasn't reached\nthe stage where I can turn it over to an assistant.\"\n\n\"Then I won't bother you with the details,\" replied Carnes as he rose.\n\n\"Sit down, confound you!\" cried the doctor. \"You know better than to try\nto pull that on me. Tell me your case, and then I'll tell you whether\nI'll go or not. I can't spare the time, but, on the other hand, if it\nsounds interesting enough....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes laughed.\n\n\"All right, Doctor,\" he said, \"I'll take enough time to tell you about\nit even if you can't go. Do you know anything about it?\"\n\n\"No. I read the first story half way through and then stopped. Start at\nthe beginning and tell me the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Have you ever been to Mammoth Cave?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It, or rather they, for while it is called Mammoth Cave it is really a\nseries of caves, are located in Edmonson County in Central Kentucky, on\na spur railroad from Glasgow Junction on the Louisville and Nashville\nRailroad. They are natural limestone caverns with the customary\nstalactite and stalagmite formation, but are unusually large and very\nbeautiful. The caves are quite extensive and they are on different\nlevels, so that a guide is necessary if one wants to enter them and be\nat all sure of finding the way out. Visitors are taken over a regular\nroute and are seldom allowed to visit portions of the cave off these\nroutes. Large parts of the cave have never been thoroughly explored or\nmapped. So much for the scene.\n\n\"About a month ago a party from Philadelphia who were motoring through\nKentucky, entered the cave with a regular guide. The party consisted of\na man and his wife and their two children, a boy of fourteen and a girl\nof twelve. They went quite a distance back into the caves and then, as\nthe mother was feeling tired, she and her husband sat down, intending to\nwait until the guide showed the children some sights which lay just\nahead and then return to them. The guide and the children never\nreturned.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"No one knows. All that is known is the bare fact that they have not\nbeen seen since.\"\n\n\"A kidnapping case?\"\n\n\"Apparently not, in the light of later happenings, although that was at\nfirst thought to be the explanation. The parents waited for some time.\nThe mother says that she heard faint screams in the distance some ten\nminutes after the guide and the children left, but they were very far\naway and she isn't sure that she heard them at all. At any rate, they\ndidn't impress her at the time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"When half an hour had passed they began to feel anxious, and the father\ntook a torch and started out to hunt for them. The usual thing happened;\nhe got lost. When _he_ failed to return, the mother, now thoroughly\nalarmed, made her way, by some uncanny sense of direction, to the\nentrance and gave the alarm. In half an hour a dozen search parties were\non their way into the cave. The father was soon located, not far from\nthe beaten trail, but despite three days of constant search, the\nchildren were not located. The only trace of them that was found was a\nbracelet which the mother identified. It was found in the cavern some\ndistance from the beaten path and was broken, as though by violence.\nThere were no other signs of a struggle.\n\n\"When the bracelet was found, the kidnapping theory gained vogue, for\nJohn Harrel, the missing guide, knew the cave well and natives of the\nvicinity scouted the idea that he might be lost. Inspired by the large\nreward offered by the father, fresh parties began to explore the unknown\nportions of the cave. And then came the second tragedy. Two of the\nsearchers failed to return. This time there seemed to be little doubt of\nviolence, for screams and a pistol shot were faintly heard by other\nsearchers, together with a peculiar 'screaming howl,' as it was\ndescribed by those who heard it. A search was at once made toward the\nspot where the bracelet had been picked up, and the gun of one of the\nmissing men was found within fifty yards of the spot where the bracelet\nhad been discovered. One cylinder of the revolver had been discharged.\"\n\n\"Were there any signs on the floor?\"\n\n\"The searchers said that the floor appeared to be rather more moist and\nslimy than usual, but that was all. They also spoke of a very faint\nsmell of musk, but this observation was not confirmed by others who\narrived a few moments later.\"\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Governor was appealed to and a company of the National Guard was\nsent from Louisville to Mammoth Cave. They took up camp at the mouth of\nthe cave and prevented everyone from entering. Soldiers armed with\nservice rifles penetrated the caverns, but found nothing. Visitors were\nexcluded, and the guardsmen established regular patrols and sentry posts\nin the cave with the result that one night, when time came for a relief,\nthe only trace that could be found of one of the guards was his rifle.\nIt had not been fired. Double guards were then posted, and nothing\nhappened for several days--and then another sentry disappeared. His\ncompanion came rushing out of the cave screaming. When he recovered, he\nadmitted that both he and the missing man had gone to sleep and that he\nawoke to find his comrade gone. He called, and he says that the answer\nhe received was a peculiar whistling noise which raised all the hair on\nthe back of his neck. He flashed his electric torch all around, but\ncould see nothing. He swears, however, that he heard a slipping, sliding\nnoise approaching him, and he felt that some one was looking at him. He\nstood it as long as he could and then threw down his rifle and ran for\nhis life.\"\n\n\"Had he been drinking?\"\n\n\"No. It wasn't delirium either, as was shown by the fact that a patrol\nfound his gun where he had thrown it, but no trace of the other sentry.\nAfter this second experience, the guardsmen weren't very eager to enter\nthe cave, and the Governor asked for regulars. A company of infantry was\nordered down from Fort Thomas to relieve the guardsmen, but they fared\nworse than their predecessors. They lost two men the first night of\ntheir guard. The regulars weren't caught napping, for the main guard\nheard five shots fired. They rushed a patrol to the scene and found both\nof the rifles which had been fired, but the men were gone.\n\n\"The officer of the day made a thorough search of the vicinity and\nfound, some two hundred yards from the spot where the sentries had been\nposted, a crack in the wall through which the body of a man could be\nforced. This bodycrack had fresh blood on each side of it. Several of\nhis men volunteered to enter the hole and search, but the lieutenant\nwould not allow it. Instead, he armed himself with a couple of\nhand-grenades and an electric torch and entered himself. That was last\nTuesday, and he has not returned.\"\n\n\"Was there any disturbance heard from the crack?\"\n\n\"None at all. A guard was posted with two machine-guns pointed at the\ncrack in the wall, and a guard of eight men and a sergeant stationed\nthere. Last night, about six o'clock, while the guard were sitting\naround their guns, a faint smell of musk became evident. No one paid a\ngreat deal of attention to it, but suddenly for no apparent reason at\nall one of the men on guard was jerked into the air feet upwards. He\ngave a scream of fear, and an unearthly screech answered him. The guard,\nwith the exception of one man, turned tail and ran. One man stuck by his\ngun and poured a stream of bullets into the crack. The retreating men\ncould hear the rattle of the gun for a few moments and then there was a\nchoking scream, followed by silence. When the officer of the day got\nback with a patrol, there was a heavy smell of musk in the air, and a\ngood deal of blood was splashed around. The machine-guns were both\nthere, although one of them was twisted up until it looked like it had\nbeen through an explosion.\n\n\"The Officer commanding the company investigated the place, ordered all\nmen out of the cave, and communicated with the War Department. The\nSecretary of War found it too tough a nut to crack and he asked for\nhelp, so Bolton is sending me down there. Do you think, in view of this\nyarn, that your experiments can wait?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe creases on Dr. Bird's high forehead had grown deeper and deeper as\nCarnes had told his story, but now they suddenly disappeared, and he\njumped to his feet with a boyish grin.\n\n\"How soon are we leaving?\" he asked.\n\n\"In two hours, Doctor. A car is waiting for us downstairs and I have\nreservations booked for both of us on the Southern to-night. I knew that\nyou were coming; in fact, the request for your services had been\napproved before I came here to see you.\"\n\nDr. Bird rapidly divested himself of his laboratory smock and took his\ncoat and hat from a cupboard.\n\n\"I hope you realize, Carnsey, old dear,\" he said as he followed the\noperative out of the building, \"that I have a real fondness for your\nworthless old carcass. I am leaving the results of two weeks of patient\nwork alone and unattended in order to keep you out of trouble, and I\nknow that it will be ruined when I get back. I wonder whether you are\nworth it?\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" retorted Carnes. \"I'm mighty glad to have you along, but you\nneedn't rub it in by pretending that it is affection for me that is\ndragging you reluctantly into this mess. With an adventure like this\nahead of you, leg-irons and handcuffs wouldn't keep you away from\nMammoth Cave, whether I was going or not.\"\n\nIt was late afternoon before Dr. Bird and Carnes dismounted from the\nspecial train which had carried them from Glasgow Junction to Mammoth\nCave. They introduced themselves to the major commanding the guard\nbattalion which had been ordered down to reinforce the single company\nwhich had borne the first brunt of the affair, and then interviewed the\nguards who had been routed by the unseen horror which was haunting the\nfamous cave. Nothing was learned which differed in any great degree from\nthe tale which Carnes had related to the doctor in Washington, except\nthat the officer of the day who had investigated the last attack failed\nto entirely corroborate the smell of musk which had been reported by the\nother observers.\n\n\"It might have been musk, but to me it smelled differently,\" he said.\n\"Were you ever near a rattlesnake den in the west?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird nodded.\n\n\"Then you know the peculiar reptilian odor which such a place gives off.\nWell, this smell was somewhat similar, although not the same by any\nmanner of means. It was musky all right, but it was more snake than musk\nto me. I rather like musk, but this smell gave me the horrors.\"\n\n\"Did you hear any noises?\"\n\n\"None at all. The men describe some rather peculiar noises and Sergeant\nJervis is an old file and pretty apt to get things straight, but they\nmay have been made by the men who were in trouble. I saw a man caught by\na boa in South America once, and the noises he made might very well have\nbeen described in almost the same words as Jervis used.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Lieutenant,\" replied the Doctor. \"I'll remember what you have\ntold me. Now I think that we'll go into the cave.\"\n\n\"My orders are to allow no one to enter, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon. Carnes, where is that letter from the Secretary of\nWar?\"\n\nCarnes produced the document. The lieutenant examined it and excused\nhimself. He returned in a few moments with the commanding officer.\n\n\"In the face of that letter, Dr. Bird,\" said the major, \"I have no\nalternative to allowing you to enter the cave, but I will warn you that\nit is at your own peril. I'll give you an escort, if you wish.\"\n\n\"If Lieutenant Pearce will come with me as a guide, that will be all\nthat I need.\"\n\nThe lieutenant paled slightly, but threw back his shoulders.\n\n\"Do you wish to start at once, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"In a few moments. What is the floor of the cave like where we are\ngoing?\"\n\n\"Quite wet and slimy, sir.\"\n\n\"Very slippery?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In that case before we go in we want to put on baseball shoes with\ncleats on them, so that we can run if we have to. Can you get us\nanything like that?\"\n\n\"In a few moments, sir.\"\n\n\"Good! As soon as we can get them we'll start. In the meantime, may I\nlook at that gun that was found?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Browning machine-gun was laid before the doctor. He looked it over\ncritically and sniffed delicately at it. He took from his pocket a phial\nof liquid, moistened a portion of the water-jacket of the weapon, and\nthen rubbed the moistened part briskly with his hand. He sniffed again.\nHe looked disappointed, and again examined the gun closely.\n\n\"Carnes,\" he said at length, \"do you see anything on this gun that looks\nlike tooth marks?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Neither do I. There are some marks here which might quite conceivably\nbe finger-prints of a forty-foot giant, and those two parallel grooves\nlook like the result of severe squeezing, but there are no tooth marks.\nStrange. There is no persistent odor on the gun, which is also strange.\nWell, there's no use in theorizing: we are confronted by a condition and\nnot a theory, as someone once said. Let's put on those baseball shoes\nand see what we can find out.\"\n\nDr. Bird led the way into the cave, Carnes and the lieutenant following\nclosely with electric torches. In each hand Dr. Bird carried a\nphosphorus hand-grenade. No other weapons were visible, although the\ndoctor knew that Carnes carried a caliber .45 automatic pistol strapped\nunder his left armpit. As they passed into the cave the lieutenant\nstepped forward to lead the way.\n\n\"I'm going first,\" said the doctor. \"Follow me and indicate the turns by\npressure on my shoulder. Don't speak after we have started, and be ready\nfor instant flight. Let's go.\"\n\nForward into the interior of the cave they made their way. The iron\ncleats of the baseball shoes rang on the floor and the noise echoed back\nand forth between the walls, dying out in little eerie whispers of sound\nthat made Carnes' hair rise. Ever forward they pressed, the lieutenant\nguiding the doctor by silent pressure on his shoulder and Carnes\nfollowing closely. For half a mile they went on until a restrainable\npressure brought the doctor to a halt. The lieutenant pointed silently\ntoward a crack in the wall before them. Carnes started forward to\nexamine it, but a warning gesture from the doctor stopped him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, an inch at a time, the doctor crept forward, hand-grenades in\nreadiness. Presently he reached the crack and, shifting one of the\ngrenades into his pocket, he drew forth an electric torch and sent a\nbeam of light through the crack into the dark interior of the earth.\n\nFor a moment he stood thus, and then suddenly snapped off his torch and\nstraightened up in an attitude of listening. The straining ears of\nCarnes and Lieutenant Pearce could hear a faint slithering noise coming\ntoward them, not from the direction of the crack, but from the interior\nof the cave. Simultaneously a faint, musky, reptilian odor became\napparent.\n\n\"Run!\" shouted the doctor. \"Run like hell! It's loose in the cave!\"\n\nThe lieutenant turned and fled at top speed toward the distant entrance\nto the cave, Carnes at his heels. Dr. Bird paused for an instant,\nstraining his ears, and then threw a grenade. A blinding flash came from\nthe point where the missile struck and a white cloud rose in the air.\nThe doctor turned and fled after his companions. Not for nothing had Dr.\nBird been an athlete of note in his college days. Despite the best\nefforts of his companions, who were literally running for their lives,\nhe soon caught up with them. As he did so a weird, blood-curdling\nscreech rose from the darkness behind them. Higher and higher in pitch\nthe note rose until it ended suddenly in a gurgling grunt, as though the\nbreath which uttered it had been suddenly cut off. The slithering,\nrustling noise became louder on their trail.\n\n\"Faster!\" gasped the doctor, as he put his hand on Carnes' shoulder and\npushed him forward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe noise of pursuit gained slightly on them, and a sound as of intense\nbreathing became audible. Dr. Bird paused and turned and faced the\noncoming horror. His electric torch revealed nothing, but he listened\nfor a moment, and then threw his second grenade. Keenly he watched its\nflight. It flew through the air for thirty yards and then struck an\ninvisible obstruction and bounded toward the ground. Before it struck\nthe downward motion ceased, and it rose in the air. As it rose it burst\nwith a sharp report, and a wild scream of pain filled the cavern with a\ndeafening roar. The doctor fled again after his companions.\n\nBy the time he overtook them the entrance of the cave loomed before\nthem. With sobs of relief they burst out into the open. The guards\nsprang forward with raised rifles, but Dr. Bird waved them back.\n\n\"There's nothing after us, men,\" he panted. \"We got chased a little way,\nbut I tossed our pursuer a handful of phosphorus and it must have burned\nhis fingers a little, judging from the racket he made. At any rate, it\nstopped the pursuit.\"\n\nThe major hurried up.\n\n\"Did you see it, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I didn't. No one has ever seen it or anything like it. I heard it\nand, from its voice, I think it has a bad cold. At least, it sounded\nhoarse, so I gave it a little white phosphorus to make a poultice for\nits throat, but I didn't get a glimpse of it.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, Doctor, what is it?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you yet, Major. So far I can tell, it is something new to\nscience and I am not sure just what it looks like. However, I hope to be\nable to show it to you shortly. Is there a telegraph office here?\"\n\n\"No, but we have a Signal Corps detachment with us, and they have a\nportable radio set which will put us in touch with the army net.\"\n\n\"Good! Can you place a tent at my disposal?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Doctor.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll go there, and I would appreciate it if you would send\nthe radio operator to me. I want to send a message to the Bureau of\nStandards to forward me some apparatus which I need.\"\n\n\"I'll attend to it, Doctor. Have you any special advice to give me about\nthe guarding?\"\n\n\"Yes. Have you, or can you get, any live stock?\"\n\n\"Live stock?\"\n\n\"Yes. Cattle preferred, although hogs or sheep will do at a pinch. Sheep\nwill do quite well.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can do, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Get them by all means, if it is possible to do so. Don't worry about\npaying for them: secret service funds are not subject to the same audit\nthat army funds get. If you can locate them, drive a couple of cattle or\nhalf a dozen sheep well into the cave and tether them there. If you\ndon't get them, have your sentries posted well away from the cave mouth,\nand if any disturbance occurs during the night, tell them to break and\nrun. I hope it won't come out, but I can't tell.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA herd of cattle was soon located and two of the beasts driven into the\ncave. Two hours later a series of horrible screams and bellowings were\nheard in the cave. Following their orders the sentries abandoned their\nposts and scattered, but the noise came no nearer the mouth, and in a\nfew minutes silence again reigned.\n\n\"I hope that will be all that will be needed for a couple of days,\" said\nthe doctor to the commanding officer, \"but you had better have a couple\nmore cattle driven in in the morning. We want to keep the brute well\nfed. Is there a tank stationed at Fort Thomas?\"\n\n\"No, there isn't.\"\n\n\"Then radio Washington that I want the fastest three-man tank that the\narmy has sent here at once. Don't bother with military channels, radio\ndirect to the Adjutant General, quoting the Secretary of the Treasury as\nauthority. Tell him that it's a rush matter, and sign the message 'Bird'\nif you are afraid of getting your tail twisted.\"\n\nTwice more before the apparatus which the doctor had ordered from\nWashington arrived cattle were driven into the depths of the cave, and\ntwice were the screams and bellowings from the cave repeated. Each time\nsearching parties found the cattle gone in the morning. A week after the\ndoctor's arrival, a special train came up, carrying four mechanics from\nthe Bureau of Standards, together with a dozen huge packing cases. Under\nthe direction of the doctor the cases were unpacked and the apparatus\nput together. Before the assembly had been completed the tank which had\nbeen requested arrived from Camp Meade, and the Bureau mechanics began\nto install some of the assembled units in it.\n\nThe first apparatus which was installed in the tank consisted of an\nelectric generator of peculiar design which was geared to the tank\nmotor. The electromotive force thus generated was led across a spark gap\nwith points of a metallic substance. The light produced was concentrated\nby a series of parabolic reflectors, directed against a large quartz\nprism, and thence through a lens which was designed to throw a slightly\ndivergent beam.\n\n\"This apparatus,\" Dr. Bird explained to the Signal Corps officer, who\nwas an interested observer, \"is one which was designed at the Bureau for\nthe large scale production of ultra-violet light. There is nothing\nspecial about the generator except that it is highly efficient and gives\nan almost constant electromotive force. The current thus produced is\nled across these points, which are composed of magnalloy, a development\nof the Bureau. We found on investigation that a spark gave out a light\nwhich was peculiarly rich in ultra-violet rays when it was passed\nbetween magnesium points. However, such points could not be used for the\nhandling of a steady current because of lack of durability and ease of\nfusion, so a mixture of graphite, alundum and metallic magnesium was\npressed together with a binder which will stand the heat. Thus we get\nthe triple advantages of ultra-violet light production, durability, and\nhigh resistance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The system of reflectors catches all of the light thus produced except\nthe relatively small portion which goes initially in the right\ndirection, and directs it on this quartz prism where, due to the\nrefractive powers of the prism, the light is broken up into its\ncomponent parts. The infra-red rays and that portion of the spectrum\nwhich lies in the visible range, that is, from red to violet inclusive,\nare absorbed by a black body, leaving only the ultra-violet portion free\nto send a beam through this quartz lens.\"\n\n\"I thought that a lens would absorb ultra-violet light,\" objected the\nsignal officer.\n\n\"A lens made of glass will, but this lens is made of rock crystal, which\nis readily permeable to ultra-violet. The net result of this apparatus\nis that we can direct before us as we move in the tank a beam of light\nwhich is composed solely of the ultra-violet portion of the spectrum.\"\n\n\"In other words, an invisible light?\"\n\n\"Yes. That is, invisible to the human eye. The effect of this beam of\nultra-violet light in the form of severe sunburn would be readily\napparent if you exposed your skin to it for any length of time, and the\neffects on your eyesight of continued gazing would be apt to be\ndisastrous. It would produce a severe opthalmia and temporary\nimpairment of the vision, somewhat the same symptoms as are observed in\nsnow blindness.\"\n\n\"I see. May I ask what is the object of the whole thing?\"\n\n\"Surely. Before we can successfully combat this peculiar visitant from\nanother world, it is necessary that we gain some idea of the size and\nappearance of it. Nothing of the sort has before made its appearance, so\nfar as the annals of science go, and so I am forced to make some rather\nwild guesses at the nature of the animal. You are probably aware of the\nfact that the property of penetration possessed by all waves is a\nfunction of their frequency, or, perhaps I should say, of their\nwave-length?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"The longer rays of visible light will not penetrate as deeply into a\ngiven substance as the shorter ultra-violet rays. This visitor is\nevidently from some unexplored and, indeed, unknown cavern in the depths\nof the earth where visible light has never penetrated. Apparently in\nthis cavern the color of the inhabitants is ultra-violet, and hence\ninvisible to us.\"\n\n\"You are beyond my depth, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Pardon me. You understand, of course, what color is? When sunlight,\nwhich is a mixture of all colors from infra-red to ultra-violet\ninclusive, falls on an object, certain rays are reflected and certain\nothers are absorbed. If the red rays are reflected and all others\nabsorbed, the object appears red to our eyes. If all the rays are\nreflected, the object appears white, and if all are absorbed, it appears\nblack.\"\n\n\"I understand that.\"\n\n\"The human eye cannot detect ultra-violet. Suppose then, that we have an\nobject, either animate or inanimate, the surface of which reflects only\nultra-violet light, what will be the result? The object will be\ninvisible.\"\n\n\"I should think it would be black if all the rays except the\nultra-violet were absorbed.\"\n\n\"It would, but mark, I did not say the others were absorbed. Are you\nfamiliar with fluorescein?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I think you are. It is the dye used in making changeable silk. If we\nfill a glass container with a fluorescein solution and look at it by\nreflected light it appears green. If we look at it by transmitted light,\nthat is, light which has traversed the solution, it appears red. In\nother words, this is a substance which reflects green light, allows a\nfree passage to red light, and absorbs all other light. This creature we\nare after, if my theory is correct, is composed of a substance which\nallows free passage to all of the visible light rays and at the same\ntime reflects ultra-violet light. Do I make this clear?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. My apparatus will project forward a beam of\nultra-violet light which will be in much greater concentration than\nexists in an incandescent electric light. It is my hope that this light\nwill be reflected by the body of the creature to a sufficient to allow\nme to make a photograph of it.\"\n\n\"But won't your lens prevent the ultra-violet light from reaching your\nplate?\"\n\n\"An ordinary lens made of optical glass would do so, but I have a camera\nhere equipped with a rock crystal lens, which will allow ultra-violet\nlight to pass through it practically unhindered, and with very slight\ndistortion. When I add that I will have my camera charged with X-ray\nfilm, a film which is peculiarly sensitive to the shorter wave-lengths,\nyou will see that I will have a fair chance of success.\"\n\n\"It sounds logical. Would you allow me to accompany you when you make\nyour attempt?\"\n\n\"I will be glad of your company, if you can drive a tank. I want to take\nCarnes with me, and the tank will only hold two besides the driver.\"\n\n\"I can drive a tractor.\"\n\n\"In that case you should master the tricks of tank driving in short\norder. Get familiar with it and we'll appoint you as driver. We'll be\nready to go in to-night, but I am going to wait a day. Our friend was\nfed last night, and there is less chance he'll be about.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe early part of the next evening was marked by howls and screams\ncoming from the mouth of the cave. As the night wore on the noises were\nquite evidently coming nearer and the sentries watched the cave mouth\nnervously, ready to bolt and scatter according to their orders at the\nfirst alarm. About two A. M. the doctor and Carnes climbed into the tank\nbeside Lieutenant Leffingwell, and the machine moved slowly into the\ncave. A search-light on the front of the tank lighted the way for them\nand, attached to a frame which held it some distance ahead of them, was\na luckless sheep.\n\n\"Keep your eye on the mutton, Carnes,\" cautioned the doctor. \"As soon as\nanything happens to it, shut off the search-light and let me try to get\na picture. As soon as I have made my exposures I'll tell you, and you\ncan snap it on again. Lieutenant, when the picture is made, turn your\ntank and make for the entrance to the cave. If we are lucky, we'll get\nout.\"\n\nForward the tank crawled, the sheep bleating and trying to break loose\nfrom the bonds which held it. It was impossible to hear much over the\nroar of the motor, but presently Dr. Bird leaned forward, his eyes\nshining.\n\n\"I smell musk,\" he announced. \"Get ready for action.\"\n\nEven as he spoke the sheep was suddenly lifted into the air. It gave a\nfinal bleat of terror, and then its head was torn from its body.\n\n\"Quick, Carnes!\" shouted the doctor.\n\nThe search-light went out, and Carnes and the lieutenant could hear the\nslide of the ultra-violet light which Dr. Bird was manipulating open.\nFor two or three minutes the doctor worked with his apparatus.\n\n\"All right!\" he cried suddenly. \"Lights on and get out of here!\"\n\nCarnes snapped on the search-light and Lieutenant Leffingwell swung the\ntank around and headed for the cave mouth. For a few feet their progress\nwas unhindered and then the tank ceased its forward motion, although the\nmotor still roared and the track slid on the cave floor. Carnes watched\nwith horror as one side of the tank bent slowly in toward him. There was\na rending sound, and a portion of the heavy steel fabric was torn away.\nDr. Bird bent over something on the floor of the tank. Presently he\nstraightened up and threw a small object into the darkness. There was a\nflash of light, and bits of flaming phosphorus flew in every direction.\nThe anchor which held the tank was suddenly loosed and the machine\ncrawled forward at full speed, while a roar as of escaping air mingled\nwith a bellowing shriek burdened the smoke-laden air.\n\n\"Faster!\" cried the doctor, as he threw another grenade.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLieutenant Leffingwell got the last bit of speed possible out of the\ntank and they reached the cave mouth without further molestation.\n\n\"I had an idea that our friend wouldn't care to pass through a\nphosphorus screen,\" said Dr. Bird with a chuckle as he climbed out of\nthe tank. \"He must have been rather severely burned the other day, and\nonce burned is usually twice shy. Where is Major Brown?\"\n\nThe commanding officer stepped forward.\n\n\"Drive a couple of cattle into the cave, Major,\" directed Dr. Bird. \"I\nwant to fill that brute up and keep him quiet for a while. I'm going to\ndevelop my films.\"\n\nLieutenant Leffingwell and Carnes peered over the doctor's shoulders as\nhe manipulated his films in a developing bath. Gradually vague lines and\nblotches made their appearance on one of the films, but the form was\nindistinct. Dr. Bird dropped the films in a fixing tank and straightened\nup.\n\n\"We have something, gentlemen,\" he announced, \"but I can't tell yet how\nclear it is. It will take those films fifteen minutes to fix, and then\nwe'll know.\"\n\nIn a quarter of an hour he lifted the first film from the tank and held\nit to the light. The film showed a blank. With an exclamation of\ndisappointment he lifted a second and third film from the tank, with the\nsame result He raised the fourth one.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" gasped Carnes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the plate could be plainly seen the hind quarters of the sheep held\nin the grasp of such a monster as even the drug-laden brain of an opium\nsmoker never pictured. Judging from the sheep, the monster stood about\ntwenty feet tall, and its frame was surmounted by a head resembling an\novergrown frog. Enormous jaws were opened to seize the sheep but, to the\namazement of the three observers, the jaws were entirely toothless.\nWhere teeth were to be expected, long parallel ridges of what looked\nlike bare bone, appeared, without even a rudimentary segregation into\nteeth. The body of the monster was long and snakelike, and was borne on\nlong, heavy legs ending in feet with three long toes, armed with vicious\nclaws. The crowning horror of the creature was its forelegs. There were\nof enormous length, thin and attenuated looking, and ended in huge\nmisshapen hands, knobby and blotched, which grasped the sheep in the\nsame manner as human hands. The eyes were as large as dinner plates, and\nthey were glaring at the camera with an expression of fiendish\nmalevolence which made Carnes shudder.\n\n\"How does that huge thing ever get through that crack we examined?\"\ndemanded the lieutenant.\n\nDr. Bird rubbed his head thoughtfully.\n\n\"It's not an amphibian,\" he muttered, \"as is plainly shown by the shape\nof the limbs and the lack of a tail, and yet it appears to have scales\nof the true fish type. It corresponds to no recovered fossil, and I am\ninclined to believe it is unique. The nervous organisation must be very\nlow, judging from the lack of forehead and the general conformation. It\nhas enormous strength, and yet the arms look feeble.\"\n\n\"It can't get through that crack,\" insisted the lieutenant.\n\n\"Apparently not,\" replied the doctor. \"Wait a moment, though. Look at\nthis!\"\n\nHe pointed to the great disproportion between the length and diameter of\nthe forelegs, and then to the hind legs.\n\n\"Either this is grave distortion or there is something mighty queer\nabout that conformation. No animal could be constructed like that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned the film so that an oblique light fell on it. As he did so he\ngave a cry of astonishment.\n\n\"Look here!\" he said sharply. \"It does get through that crack! Look at\nthose arms and hands! There is the answer. This creature is tall and\nbroad, but from front to rear it can measure only a few inches. The same\nmust be true of the froglike head. That animal has been developed to\nlive and move in a low roofed cavern, and to pass through openings only\na few inches wide. Its bulk is all in two dimensions!\"\n\n\"I believe you're right,\" said Carnes as he studied the film.\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" answered the doctor. \"Look at those paws,\ntoo, Carnes. That substance isn't bone, it's gum. The thing is so young\nand helpless that it hasn't cut its teeth yet. It must be a baby, and\nthat is the reason why it made its way into the cave when no other of\nits kind ever has.\"\n\n\"How large are full grown ones if this is a baby?\" asked the\nlieutenant.\n\n\"The Lord alone knows,\" replied Dr. Bird. \"I hope that I never have to\nface one and find out. Well, now that we know what we are fighting, we\nought to be able to settle its hash.\"\n\n\"High explosive?\" suggested the lieutenant.\n\n\"I don't think so. With such a low nervous organization, we would have\nto tear it practically to pieces to kill it, and I am anxious to keep it\nfrom mutilation for scientific study. I have an idea, but I'll have to\nstudy a while before I am sure of the details. Send me the radio\noperator.\"\n\nThe next day the Bureau mechanics began to dismount the apparatus from\nthe tank and to assemble another elaborate contrivance. Before they had\nmade an end of the work additional equipment arrived from Washington,\nwhich was incorporated in the new set-up. At length Dr. Bird pronounced\nhimself ready for the attempt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder his direction, three cattle were driven into the cave and there\ntethered. They were there the next morning unharmed, but the second\nnight the now familiar bellowing and howling came from the depths of the\ncave and in the morning two of the cattle were gone.\n\n\"That will keep him quiet for a day or two,\" said the doctor, \"and now\nto work!\"\n\nThe tank made its way into the cave, dragging after it two huge cables\nwhich led to an engine-driven generator outside the cave. These cables\nwere attached to the terminals of a large motor which was set up in the\ncave near the place where the cattle were customarily tethered. This\nmotor was the actuating force which turned two generators, one large and\none small. The smaller one was mounted on a platform on wheels, which\nalso contained the spark gaps, the reflectors and other apparatus which\nproduced the beam of ultra-violet light which had been used to\nphotograph the monster.\n\nFrom the larger generator led two copper bars. One of these was\nconnected to a huge copper plate which was laid flat on the floor of the\ncave. The other led to a platform which was erected on huge porcelain\ninsulators some fifteen feet above the floor. Huge condensers were set\nup on this platform, and Dr. Bird announced himself in readiness.\n\nA steer was dragged into the cave and up a temporary runway which led to\nthe platform containing the condensers, and there tied with the copper\nbus bar from the larger generator fastened to three flexible copper\nstraps which led around the animal's body. When this had been completed,\neveryone except the doctor, Carnes, and Lieutenant Leffingwell left the\ncave. These three crouched behind the search-light which sent a mild\nbeam of ultra-violet onto the platform where the steer was held. The\nengine outside the cave was started, and the three men waited with tense\nnerves.\n\nFor several hours nothing happened. The steer tried from time to time to\nmove and, finding it impossible, set up plaintive bellows for liberty.\n\n\"I wish something would happen,\" muttered the lieutenant. \"This is\ngetting on my nerves.\n\n\"Something is about to happen,\" replied Dr. Bird grimly. \"Listen to that\nsteer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bellowing of the steer had suddenly increased in volume and, added\nto the note of discontent, was a note of fright which had previously\nbeen absent. Dr. Bird bent over his ultra-violet search-light and made\nsome adjustments. He handed a helmetlike arrangement to each of his\ncompanions and slipped one on over his head.\n\n\"I can't see a thing, Doctor,\" said Carnes in a muffled voice.\n\n\"The objects at which you are looking absorb rather than reflect\nultra-violet light,\" said the doctor. \"This is a sort of a fluoroscope\narrangement, and it isn't perfect at all. However, when the monster\ncomes along, I am pretty sure that you will be able to see it. You may\nsee a little more as your eyes get accustomed to it.\"\n\n\"I can see very dimly,\" announced the lieutenant in a moment.\n\nDimly the walls of the cave and the platform before them began to take\nvague shape. The three stared intently down the beam of ultra-violet\nlight which the doctor directed down the passageway leading deeper into\nthe cave.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" ejaculated Carnes suddenly.\n\nSlowly into the field of vision came the hideous figure they had seen on\nthe film. As it moved forward a rustling, slithering sound could be\nheard, even over the bellowing of the steer and the hum of the\napparatus. The odor of musk became evident.\n\nAlong the floor toward them the thing slid. Presently it reared up on\nits hind legs and its enormous bulk became evident. It turned somewhat\nsideways and the correctness of Dr. Bird's hypothesis as to its peculiar\nshape was proved. All of the bulk of the creature was in two dimensions.\nForward it moved, and the horrible human hands stretched forward, while\nthe mouth split in a wide, toothless grin. Nearer the doomed steer the\ncreature approached, and then the reaching hands closed on the animal.\n\nThere was a blinding flash, and the monster was hurled backward as\nthough struck by a thunderbolt, while a horrible smell of musk and\nburned flesh filled the air.\n\n\"After it! Quick!\" cried the doctor as he sprang forward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore he could reach the prostrate creature it moved and then, slowly\nat first, but with rapidly gaining speed, it slithered over the floor in\nretreat. Dr. Bird's hand swung through an arc, and there was a deafening\ncrash as a hand-grenade exploded on the back of the fleeing monster.\n\nAn unearthly scream came from the creature, and its motion changed from\na steady forward glide to a series of convulsive jerks. Leffingwell and\nCarnes threw grenades, but they went wide of their mark, and the monster\nbegan to again increase its speed. Another volley of grenades was thrown\nand one hit scored, which slowed the monster somewhat but did not arrest\nthe steady forward movement.\n\n\"Any more bombs?\" demanded the doctor.\n\n\"Damn!\" he cried as he received negative answers. \"The current wasn't\nstrong enough. It's going to get away.\"\n\nCarnes jerked his automatic from under his armpit and poured a stream of\nbullets into the fleeing monster. Slower and slower the motion of the\ncreature became, and its movements again became jerky and convulsive.\n\n\"Keep it in sight!\" cried the doctor. \"We may get it yet!\"\n\nCautiously the three men followed the retreating horror, Leffingwell\npushing before him the platform holding the ultra-violet ray apparatus.\nThe chase led them over familiar ground.\n\n\"There is the crack!\" cried the lieutenant.\n\n\"Too late!\" replied the doctor.\n\nHe rushed forward and seized the lower limb of the monster and tried\nwith all his strength to arrest its flight, but despite all that he\ncould do it slid sideways through the crack in the wall and disappeared.\nA final backward kick of its leg threw the doctor twenty feet against\nthe far wall of the cave.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Doctor?\" cried Carnes.\n\n\"No, I'm all right. Put on your masks and start the gas! Quick! That may\nstop it before it gets in far!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three adjusted gas masks and thrust the mouths of two gas cylinders\nwhich were on the light truck into the crack, and opened the valves. The\nhissing of the gas was accompanied by a thrashing, writhing sound from\nthe bowels of the earth for a few minutes, but the sound retreated and\nfinally died away into an utter silence.\n\n\"And that's that!\" cried the doctor half an hour later as they took off\ntheir gas masks outside the cave. \"It got away from us. Carnes, how soon\ncan we get a train back to Washington?\"\n\n\"What kind of a report are you going to make to the Bureau, Doctor?\"\nasked Carnes as they sat in the smoker of a southern train, headed for\nthe capital.\n\n\"I'm not going to put in any report, Carnes,\" replied the doctor. \"I\nhaven't got the creature or any part of it to show, and no one would\nbelieve me. I am going to maintain a discreet silence about the whole\nmatter.\"\n\n\"But you have your photograph to show, Doctor, and you have my evidence\nand Lieutenant Leffingwell's.\"\n\n\"The photograph might have been faked and I might have doped both of\nyou. In any case, your words are no better than mine. No, indeed,\nCarnes, when I failed to make the current strong enough to kill it\noutright I made the first of the moves which bind me to silence,\nalthough I thought that two hundred thousand volts would be enough.\n\n\"The second failure I made was when I missed him with my second grenade,\nalthough I doubt if all six would have stopped him. My third failure was\nwhen we failed to get a sufficient concentration of cyanide gas into\nthat hole in a hurry. The thing is so badly crippled that it will die,\nbut it may take hours, or even days, for it to do so. It has already\nmade its way so far into the earth that we couldn't reach it by blasting\nwithout danger of bringing the whole place down on our heads. Even if we\ncould blast our way into the place it came from I wouldn't dare open a\npath which would allow Lord only knows what terrible monsters to invade\nthe earth. When the soldiers have finished stopping that crack with ten\nfeet of solid masonry, I think the barrier will hold, even against that\ncritter's papa and mamma and all its relatives. Then Mammoth Cave will\nbe safe for visitors again. That latter fact is the only report which I\nwill make.\"\n\n\"It is a dandy story to go to waste,\" said Carnes soberly.\n\n\"Tell it then, if you wish, and get laughed at for your pains. No,\nCarnes, you must learn one thing. A man like Bolton, for instance, will\nimplicitly believe that a four leaf clover in his watch-charm will bring\nhim good luck, and that carrying a buckeye keeps rheumatism away from\nhim; but tell him a bit of sober fact like this, attested by three\nreliable witnesses and a good photograph, and you'll just get laughed at\nfor your pains. I'm going to keep my mouth shut.\"\n\n\"So be it, then!\" replied Carnes with a sigh.\n\n\n\n\nPhantoms of Reality\n\nA COMPLETE NOVEL\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\n[Illustration: _The office room faded.... I was lying on another\nfloor.... New walls sprang around me._]\n\n[Sidenote: Red Sensua's knife came up dripping--and the two adventurers\nknew that chaos and bloody revolution had been unleashed in that shadowy\nkingdom of the fourth dimension.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_Wall Street--or the Open Road?_\n\n\nWhen I was some fifteen years old, I once made the remark, \"Why, that's\nimpossible.\"\n\nThe man to whom I spoke was a scientist. He replied gently, \"My boy,\nwhen you are grown older and wiser you will realize that nothing is\nimpossible.\"\n\nSomehow, that statement stayed with me. In our swift-moving wonderful\nworld I have seen it proven many times. They once thought it impossible\nto tell what lay across the broad, unknown Atlantic Ocean. They thought\nthe vault of the heavens revolved around the earth. It was impossible\nfor it to do anything else, because they could see it revolve. It was\nimpossible, too, for anything to be alive and yet be so small that one\nmight not see it. But the microscope proved the contrary. Or again, to\ntalk beyond the normal range of the human voice was impossible, until\nthe telephone came to show how simply and easily it might be done.\n\nI never forgot that physician's remark. And it was repeated to me some\nten years later by my friend, Captain Derek Mason, on that memorable\nJune night of 1929.\n\nMy name is Charles Wilson. I was twenty-five that June of 1929. Although\nI had lived all of my adult life in New York City, I had no relatives\nthere and few friends.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had known Captain Mason for several years. Like myself, he seemed one\nwho walked alone in life. He was an English gentleman, perhaps thirty\nyears old. He had been stationed in the Bermudas, I understood, though\nhe seldom spoke of it.\n\nI always felt that I had never seen so attractive a figure of a man as\nthis Derek Mason. An English aristocrat, he was, straight and tall and\ndark, and rather rakish, with a military swagger. He affected a small,\nblack mustache. A handsome, debonair fellow, with an easy grace of\nmanner: a modern d'Artagnan. In an earlier, less civilized age, he would\nhave been expert with sword and stick, I could not doubt. A man who\ncould capture the hearts of women with a look. He had always been to me\na romantic figure, and a mystery that seemed to shroud him made him no\nless so.\n\nA friendship had sprung up between Derek Mason and me, perhaps because\nwe were such opposite types! I am an American, of medium height, and\nmedium build. Ruddy, with sandy hair. Derek Mason was as meticulous of\nhis clothes, his swagger uniforms, as the most perfect Beau Brummel. Not\nso myself. I am careless of dress and speech.\n\nI had not seen Derek Mason for at least a month when, one June\nafternoon, a note came from him. I went to his apartment at eight\no'clock the same evening. Even about his home there seemed a mystery. He\nlived alone with one man servant. He had taken quarters in a high-class\nbachelor apartment building near lower Fifth Avenue, at the edge of\nGreenwich Village.\n\nAll of which no doubt was rational enough, but in this building he had\nchosen the lower apartment at the ground-floor level. It adjoined the\ncellar. It was built for the janitor, but Derek had taken it and fixed\nit up in luxurious fashion. Near it, in a corner of the cellar, he had\nboarded off a square space into a room. I understood vaguely that it was\na chemical laboratory. He had never discussed it, nor had I ever been\nshown inside it. Unusual, mysterious enough, and that a captain of the\nBritish military should be an experimental scientist was even more\nunusual. Yet I had always believed that for a year or two Derek had been\nengaged in some sort of chemical or physical experiment. With all his\nmilitary swagger he had the precise, careful mode of thought\ncharacteristic of the man of scientific mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI recall that when I got his note with its few sentences bidding me come\nto see him, I had a premonition that it marked the beginning of\nsomething strange. As though the portals of a mystery were opening to\nme!\n\nNothing is impossible! Nevertheless I record these events into which I\nwas plunged that June evening with a very natural reluctance. I expect\nno credibility. If this were the year 2000, my narrative doubtless would\nbe tame enough. Yet in 1929 it can only be called a fantasy. Let it go\nat that. The fantasy of to-day is the sober truth of to-morrow. And by\nthe day after, it is a mere platitude. Our world moves swiftly.\n\nDerek received me in his living-room. He admitted me himself. He told me\nthat his man servant was out. It was a small room, with leather-covered\neasy chairs, rugs on its hardwood floor, and sober brown portieres at\nits door and windows. A brown parchment shade shrouded the electrolier\non the table. It was the only light in the room. It cast its mellow\nsheen upon Derek's lean graceful figure as he flung himself down and\nproduced cigarettes.\n\nHe said, \"Charlie, I want a little talk with you. I've something to tell\nyou--something to offer you.\"\n\nHe held his lighter out to me, with its tiny blue alcohol flame under my\ncigarette. And I saw that his hand was trembling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But I don't understand what you mean,\" I protested.\n\nHe retorted, \"I'm suggesting that you might be tired of being a clerk in\na brokerage office. Tired of this humdrum world that we call\ncivilization. Tired of Wall Street.\"\n\n\"I am, Derek. Heavens, that's true enough.\"\n\nHis eyes held me. He was smiling half whimsically: his voice was only\nhalf serious. Yet I could see, in the smoldering depths of those\nluminous dark eyes, a deadly seriousness that belied his smiling lips\nand his gay tone.\n\nHe interrupted me with, \"And I offer you a chance for deeds of high\nadventuring. The romance of danger, of pitting your wits against\nvillainy to make right triumph over wrong, and to win for yourself power\nand riches--and perhaps a fair lady....\"\n\n\"Derek, you talk like a swashbuckler of the middle ages.\"\n\nI thought he would grin, but he turned suddenly solemn.\n\n\"I'm offering to make you henchman to a king, Charlie.\"\n\n\"King of what? Where?\"\n\nHe spread his lean brown hands with a gesture. He shrugged. \"What\nmatter? If you seek adventure, you can find it--somewhere. If you feel\nthe lure of romance--it will come to you.\"\n\nI said, \"Henchman to a king?\"\n\nBut still he would not smile. \"Yes. If I were king. I'm serious.\nAbsolutely. In all this world there is no one who cares a damn about me.\nNot in this world, but....\"\n\nHe checked himself. He went on, \"You are the same. You have no\nrelatives?\"\n\n\"No. None that ever think of me.\"\n\n\"Nor a sweetheart. Or have you?\"\n\n\"No,\" I smiled. \"Not yet. Maybe never.\"\n\n\"But you are too interested in Wall Street to leave it for the open\nroad?\" He was sarcastic now. \"Or do you fear deeds of daring? Do you\nwant to right a great wrong? Rescue an oppressed people, overturn the\ntyranny of an evil monarch, and put your friend and the girl he loves\nupon the throne? Or do you want to go down to work as usual in the\nsubway to-morrow morning? Are you afraid that in this process of\nbecoming henchman to a king you may perchance get killed?\"\n\nI matched his caustic tone. \"Let's hear it, Derek.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Challenge of the Unknown_\n\n\nIncredible! Impossible! I did not say it, though my thoughts were\nwritten on my face, no doubt.\n\nDerek said quietly, \"Difficult to believe, Charlie? Yes! But it happens\nto be true. The girl I love is not of this world, but she lives\nnevertheless. I have seen her, talked with her. A slim little\nthing--beautiful....\"\n\nHe sat staring. \"This is nothing supernatural, Charlie. Only\nthe ignorant savages of our past called the unknown--the\nunusual--supernatural. We know better now.\"\n\nI said, \"This girl--\"\n\nHe gestured. \"As I told you, I have for years been working on the theory\nthat there is another world, existing here in this same space with us.\nThe Fourth Dimension! Call it that it you like. I have found it, proved\nits existence! And this girl--her name is Hope--lives in it. Let me tell\nyou about her and her people. Shall I?\"\n\nMy heart was pounding so that it almost smothered me. \"Yes, Derek.\"\n\n\"She lives here, in this Space we call New York City. She and her people\nuse this same Space at the same time that we use it. A different world\nfrom ours, existing here now with us! Unseen by us. And we are unseen by\nthem!\n\n\"A different form of matter, Charlie. As tangible to the people of the\nother realm as we are to our own world. Humans like ourselves.\"\n\nHe paused, but I could find no words to fill the gap. And presently he\nwent on:\n\n\"Hope's world, co-existing here with us, is dependent upon us. They\nspeak what we call English. They shadow us.\"\n\nI murmured, \"Phantoms of reality.\"\n\n\"Yes. A world very like ours. But primitive, where ours is civilized.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused again. His eyes were staring past me as though he could see\nthrough the walls of the cellar room into great reaches of the unknown.\nWhat a strange mixture was this Derek Mason! What a strange compound of\nthe cold reality of the scientist and the fancy of the romantic dreamer!\nYet I wonder if that is not what science is. There is no romantic lover\ngawping at the moon who could have more romance in his soul, or see in\nthe moonlit eyes of his loved one more romance than the scientist finds\nin the wonders of his laboratory.\n\nDerek went on slowly:\n\n\"A primitive world, primitive nation, primitive passions! As I see it\nnow, Charlie--as I know it to be--it seems as though perhaps Hope's\nworld is merely a replica of ours, stripped to the primitive. As though\nit might be the naked soul of our modern New York, ourselves as we\nreally are, not as we pretend to be.\"\n\nHe roused himself from his reverie.\n\n\"Hope's nation is ruled by a king. An emperor, if you like. A monarch,\nbeset with the evils of luxury and ease, and wine and women. He is\nsurrounded by his nobles, the idle aristocracy, by virtue of their birth\nproclaiming themselves of too fine a clay to work. The crimson nobles,\nthey are called. Because they affect crimson cloaks, and their beautiful\nwomen, voluptuous, sex-mad, are wont to bedeck themselves in veils and\nrobes of crimson.\n\n\"And there are workers, toilers they call them. Oppressed, down-trodden\ntoilers, with hate for the nobles and the king smoldering within them.\nIn France there was such a condition, and the bloody revolution came of\nit. It exists here now. Hope was born in the ranks of these toilers, but\nhas risen by her grace and beauty to a position in the court of this\ngraceless monarch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaped from his chair and began pacing the room. I sat silent,\nstaring at him. So strange a thing! Impossible? I could not say that. I\ncould only say, incredible to me. And as I framed the thought I knew its\nincredibility was the very measure of my limited intelligence, my lack\nof knowledge. The vast unknown of nature, so vast that everything which\nwas real to me, understandable to me, was a mere drop in the ocean of\nthe existing unknown.\n\n\"Don't you understand me now?\" Derek added vehemently. \"I'm not talking\nfantasy. Cold reality! I've found a way to transport myself--and\nyou--into this different state of matter, into this other world! I've\nalready made a test. I went there and stayed just for a few moments, a\nnight or so ago.\"\n\nIt made my heart leap wildly. He went on:--\n\n\"There is chaos there. Smoldering revolution which at any time--to-night\nperhaps--may burst into conflagration and destroy this wanton ruling\nclass.\" He laughed harshly. \"In Hope's world the workers are a primitive,\nignorant people. Superstitious. Like the peons of Mexico, they're all\nprimed and ready to shout for any leader who sets himself up. My\nchance--our chance--\"\n\nHe suddenly stopped his pacing and stood before me. \"Don't you feel the\nlure of it? The open road? 'The road is straight before me and the Red\nGods call for me!' I'm going, Charlie. Going to-night--and I want you to\ngo with me! Will you?\"\n\nWould I go? The thing leaped like a menacing shadow risen solidly to\nconfront me. Would I go?\n\nSuddenly there was before me the face of a girl. White. Apprehensive. It\nseemed almost pleading. A face beautiful, with a mouth of parted red\nlips. A face framed in long, pale-golden hair with big staring blue\neyes. Wistful eyes, wan with starlight--eyes that seemed to plead.\n\nI thought, \"Why, this is madness!\" I was not seeing this face with my\neyes. There was nothing, no one here in the room with me but Derek. I\nknew it. The shadows about us were empty. I was conjuring the face only\nfrom Derek's words, making real that which existed only in my\nimagination.\n\nYet I knew that in another realm, with my thoughts now bridging the gap,\nthe girl was real. Would I go into the unknown?\n\nThe quest of the unknown. The gauntlet of the unknown flung down now\nbefore me, as it was flung down before the ancient explorers who picked\nup its challenge and mounted the swaying decks of their little galleons\nand said, \"We'll go and see what lies off there in the unknown.\"\n\nThat same lure was on me now. I heard my voice saying, \"Why yes, I guess\nI'll go, Derek.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Into the Unknown_\n\n\nWe stood in the boarded room which was Derek's laboratory. Our\npreparations had been simple: Derek had made them all in advance. There\nwas little left to do. The laboratory was a small room of board walls,\nboard ceiling and floor. Windowless, with a single door opening into the\ncellar of the apartment house.\n\nDerek had locked the door after us as we entered. He said, \"I have sent\nmy man servant away for a week. The people in the house here think I\nhave gone away on a vacation. No one will miss us, Charlie--not for a\ntime, anyway.\"\n\nNo one would miss me, save my employers, and to them I would no doubt be\nsmall loss.\n\nWe had put out the light in Derek's apartment and locked it carefully\nafter us. This journey! I own that I was trembling, and frightened. Yet\na strange eagerness was on me.\n\nThe cellar room was comfortably furnished. Rugs were on its floor.\nWhatever apparatus of a research laboratory had been here was removed\nnow. But the evidence of it remained--Derek's long search for this\nsecret which now he was about to use. A row of board shelves at one\nside of the room showed where bottles and chemical apparatus had stood.\nA box of electrical tools and odds and ends of wire still lay discarded\nin a corner of the room. There was a tank of running water, and gas\nconnections, where no doubt bunsen burners had been.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDerek produced his apparatus. I sat on a small low couch against the\nwall and watched him as he stripped himself of his clothes. Around his\nwaist he adjusted a wide, flat, wire-woven belt. A small box was\nfastened to it in the middle of the back--a wide, flat thing of metal, a\nquarter of an inch thick, and curved to fit his body. It was a storage\nbattery of the vibratory current he was using. From the battery, tiny\nthreads of wire ran up his back to a wire necklace flat against his\nthroat. Other wires extended down his arms to the wrists. Still others\ndown his legs to the ankles. A flat electrode was connected to the top\nof his head like a helmet. I was reminded as he stood there, of medical\ncharts of the human body with the arterial system outlined. But when he\ndressed again and put on his jaunty captain's uniform, only the\nelectrode clamped to his head and the thin wires dangling from it in the\nback were visible to disclose that there was anything unusual about him.\n\nHe said smilingly, \"Don't stare at me like that.\"\n\nI took a grip on myself. This thing was frightening, now that I actually\nwas embarked on it. Derek had explained to me briefly the workings of\nhis apparatus. A vibratory electronic current, for which as yet he had\nno name, was stored in the small battery. He had said:\n\n\"There's nothing incomprehensible about this, Charlie. It's merely a\nchanging of the vibration rate of the basic substance out of which our\nbodies are made. Vibration is the governing factor of all states of\nmatter. In its essence what we call substance is wholly intangible. That\nis already proven. A vortex! A whirlpool of nothingness! It creates a\npseudo-substance which is the only material in the universe. And from\nthis, by vibration, is built the complicated structure of things as we\nsee and feel them to be, all dependent upon vibration. Everything is\naltered, directly as the vibratory rate is changed. From the most\ntenuous gas, to fluids to solids--throughout all the different states of\nmatter the only fundamental difference is the rate of vibration.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI understood the basic principle of this that he was explaining--that\nnow when this electronic current which he had captured and controlled\nwas applied to our physical body, the vibration rate of every smallest\nand most minute particle of our physical being was altered. There is so\nlittle in the vast scale of natural phenomena of which our human senses\nare cognisant! Our eyes see the colors of the spectrum, from red to\nviolet. But a vast invisible world of color lies below the red of the\nrainbow! Physicists call it the infra-red. And beyond the violet,\nanother realm--the ultra-violet. With sound it is the same. Our audible\nrange of sound is very small. There are sounds with too slow a vibratory\nrate for us to hear, and others too rapid. The differing vibratory rate\nfrom most tenuous gas to most substantial solid is all that we can\nperceive in this physical world of ours. Yet of the whole, it is so very\nlittle! This other realm to which we were now going lay in the higher,\nmore rapid vibratory scale. To us, by comparison, a more tenuous world,\na shadow realm.\n\nI listened to Derek's words, but my mind was on the practicality of what\nlay ahead. An explorer, standing upon his ship, may watch his men\nbending the sails, raising the anchor, but his mind flings out to the\njourney's end....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were soon ready. Derek wore his jaunty uniform, I wore my ordinary\nbusiness suit. A magnetic field would be about us, so that in the\ntransition anything in fairly close contact with our bodies was affected\nby the current.\n\nDerek said, \"I will go first, Charlie.\"\n\n\"But, Derek--\" A fear, greater than the trembling I had felt before,\nleaped at me. Left here alone, with no one on whom to depend!\n\nHe spoke with careful casualness, but his eyes were burning me. \"Just\nsit there, and watch. When I am gone, turn on the current as I showed\nyou and come after me. I'll wait for you.\"\n\n\"Where?\" I stammered.\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"Here. Right here. I'm not going away! Not going to\nmove. I'll be here on the couch waiting for you.\"\n\nTerrifying words! He had lowered the couch, bending out its short legs\nuntil the frame of it rested on the board floor. He drew a chair up\nbefore it and seated me. He sat down on the couch.\n\nHe said, \"Oh, one other thing. Just before you start, put out the light.\nWe can't tell how long it will be before we return.\"\n\nTerrifying words!\n\nHis right hand was on his left wrist where the tiny switch was placed.\nHe smiled again. \"Good luck to us, Charlie!\"\n\nGood luck to us! The open road, the unknown!\n\nI sat there staring. He was partly in shadow. The room was very silent.\nDerek lay propped up on one elbow. His hand threw the tiny switch.\n\nThere was a breathless moment. Derek's face was set and white, but no\nwhiter than my own, I was sure. His eyes were fixed on me. I saw him\nsuddenly quiver and twitch a little.\n\nI murmured, \"Derek--\"\n\nAt once he spoke, to reassure me. \"I'm all right, Charlie. That was just\nthe first feel of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a faint quivering throb in the room, like a tiny distant\ndynamo throbbing. The current was surging over Derek; his legs\ntwitched.\n\nA moment. The faint throbbing intensified. No louder, but rapid,\ninfinitely more rapid. A tiny throb, an aerial whine, faint as the\nwhirring wings of a humming bird. It went up the scale, ascending in\npitch, until presently it was screaming with an aerial microscopic\nvoice.\n\nBut there seemed no change in Derek. His uniform was glowing a trifle,\nthat was all. His face was composed now; he smiled, but did not speak.\nHis eyes roved away from me, as though now he were seeing things that I\ncould not see.\n\nAnother moment. No change.\n\nWhy, what was this? I blinked, gasped. There was a change! My gaze was\nfastened upon Derek's white face. White? It was more than white now! A\nsilver sheen seemed to be coming to his skin!\n\nI think no more than a minute had passed. His face was glowing,\nshimmering. A transparent look was coming to it, a thinness, a sudden\nunsubstantiality! He dropped his elbow and lay on the couch, stretched\nat full length at my feet. His eyes were staring.\n\nAnd suddenly I realized that the face that held those staring eyes was\nerased! A shimmering apparition of Derek was stretched here before me. I\ncould see through it now! Beneath the shimmering, blurred outlines of\nhis body I could see the solid folds of the couch cover. A ghost of\nDerek here. An apparition--fading--dissipating!\n\nA gossamer outline of him, imponderable, intangible.\n\nI leaped to my feet, staring down over him.\n\n\"Derek!\"\n\nThe shape of him did not move. Every instant it was more vaporous, more\nunreal.\n\nI thought, \"He's gone!\"\n\nNo! He was still there. A white mist of his form on the couch. Melting,\ndissipating in the light like a fog before sunshine. A wisp of it left,\nlike a breath, and then there was nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat on the couch. I had put out the light. Around me the room was\nblack. My fingers found the small switch at my wrist. I pressed it\nacross its tiny arc.\n\nThe first shock was slight, but infinitely strange. A shuddering,\ntwitching sensation ran all over me. It made my head reel, swept a wave\nof nausea over me, a giddiness, a feeling that I was falling through\ndarkness. I lay on the couch, bracing myself. The current was whining up\nits tiny scale. I could feel it now. A tiny throbbing, communicating\nitself to my physical being.\n\nAnd then in a moment I realized that my body was throbbing. The\nvibration of the current was communicating itself to the most minute\ncells of my body. An indescribable tiny quivering within me. Strange,\nfrightening, sickening at first. But the sickness passed, and in a\nmoment I found it almost pleasant.\n\nI could see nothing. The room was wholly dark. I lay on my side on the\ncouch, my eyes staring into the blackness around me. I could hear the\nhumming of the current, and then it seemed to fade. Abruptly I felt a\nsense of lightness. My body, lying on the couch, pressed less heavily.\n\nI gripped my arm. I was solid, substantial as before. I touched the\ncouch. It was the couch which was changing, not I! The couch cover\nqueerly seemed to melt under my hand!\n\nThe sense of my own lightness grew upon me. A lightness, a freedom,\npressed me, as though chains and shackles which all my life had\nencompassed me were falling away. A wild, queer freedom.\n\nI wondered where Derek was. Had I arrived in the other realm? Was he\nhere? I had no idea how much time had passed: a minute or two, perhaps.\n\nOr was I still in Derek's laboratory? The darkness was as solid,\nimpenetrable as ever. No, not quite dark! I saw something now. A\nglowing, misty outline around me. Then I saw that it was not the new,\nunknown realm, but still Derek's room. A shadowy, spectral room, and the\nlight, which dimly illumined it, was from outside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI lay puzzling, my own situation forgotten for the moment. The light\ncame from overhead, in another room of the apartment house. I stared.\nAround me now was a dim vista of distance, and vague, blurred, misty\noutlines of the apartment building above me. The shadowy world I had\nleft now lay bare. There was a moment when I thought I could see far\naway across a spectral city street. The shadows of the great city were\naround me. They glowed, and then were gone.\n\nA hand gripped my arm in a solid grip. Derek's voice sounded.\n\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I murmured. The couch had faded. I was conscious that I had\nfloated or drifted down a few inches, to a new level. The level of the\ncellar floor beneath the couch. Cellar floor! It was not that now. Yet\nthere was something solid here, a solid ground, and I was lying upon it,\nwith Derek sitting beside me.\n\nI murmured again, \"Yes, I'm all right.\"\n\nMy groping hand felt the ground. It was soil, with a growth of\nvegetation like a grass sward on it. Were we outdoors? It suddenly\nseemed so. I could feel soft, warm air on my face and had a sense of\nopen distance around me. A light was growing, a vague, diffused light,\nas though day were swiftly coming upon us.\n\nI felt Derek fumbling at my wrist. \"That's all, Charlie.\"\n\nThere was a slight shock. Derek was pulling me up beside him. I found\nmyself on my feet, with light around me. I stood wavering, gripping\nDerek. It was as though I had closed my eyes, and now they were suddenly\nopen. I was aware of daylight, color, and movement. A world of normality\nhere, normal to me now because I was part of it. The realm of the\nunknown!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_\"Hope, I Came....\"_\n\n\nI think I was first conscious of a queer calmness which had settled upon\nme, as though now I had withdrawn contact with the turmoil of our world!\nSomething was gone, and in its place came a calmness. But that was a\nmere transition. It had passed in a moment. I stood trembling with\neagerness, as I know Derek was trembling.\n\nA radiant effulgence of light was around us, clarifying, growing. There\nwas ground beneath our feet, and sky overhead. A rational landscape,\nstrangely familiar. A physical world like my own, but, it seemed, with a\nnew glory upon it. Nature, calmly serene.\n\nI had thought we were standing in daylight. I saw now it was bright\nstarlight. An evening, such as the evening we had just left in our own\nworld. The starlight showed everything clearly. I could see a fair\ndistance.\n\nWe stood at the top of a slight rise. I saw gentle, slightly undulating\ncountry. A brook nearby wound through a grove of trees and lost itself.\nSuddenly, with a shock, I realized how familiar this was! We stood\nfacing what in New York City we call West. The contour of this land was\nfamiliar enough for me to identify it. A mile or so ahead lay a river;\nit shimmered in its valley, with cliffs on its further side. Near at\nhand the open country was dotted with trees and checkered with round\npatches of cultivated fields. And there were occasional habitations,\nlow, oval houses of green thatch.\n\nThe faint flush of a recent sunset lay upon the landscape, mingled with\nthe starlight. A road--a white ribbon in the starlight--wound over the\ncountryside toward the river. Animals, strange of aspect, were slowly\ndragging carts. There were distant figures working in the fields.\n\nA city lay ahead of us, set along this nearer bank of the river. A city!\nIt seemed a primitive village. All was primitive, as though here might\nbe some lost Indian tribe of our early ages. The people were\npicturesque, the field workers garbed in vivid colors. The flat little\ncarts, slow moving, with broad-horned oxen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis quiet village, drowsing beside the calm-flowing river, seemed all\nvery normal. I could fancy that it was just after sundown of a quiet\nworkday. There was a faint flush of pink upon everything: the glory of\nthe sun just set. And as though to further my fancy, in the village by\nthe river, like an angelus, a faint-toned bell was chiming.\n\nWe stood for a moment gazing silently. I felt wholly normal. A warm,\npleasant wind fanned my hot face. The sense of lightness was gone. This\nwas normality to me.\n\nDerek murmured, \"Hope was to meet me here.\"\n\nAnd then we both saw her. She was coming toward us along the road. A\nslight, girlish figure, clothed in queerly vivid garments: a short\njacket of blue cloth with wide-flowing sleeves, knee-length pantaloons\nof red, with tassels dangling from them, and a wide red sash about her\nwaist. Pale golden hair was piled in a coil upon her head....\n\nShe was coming toward us along the edge of the road, from the direction\nof the city. She was only a few hundred feet from us when we first saw\nher, coming swiftly, furtively it seemed. A low pike fence bordered the\nroad. She seemed to be shielding herself in the shadows beside it.\n\nWe stood waiting in the starlight. The nearest figures in the field and\non the road were too far away to notice us. The girl advanced. Her white\narm went up in a gesture, and Derek answered. She left the road,\ncrossing the field toward us. As she came closer, I saw how very\nbeautiful she was. A girl of eighteen, perhaps, a fantastic little\nfigure with her vivid garments. The starlight illumined her white face,\nanxious, apprehensive, but eager.\n\n\"Derek!\"\n\nHe said, \"Hope, I came....\"\n\nI stood silently watching. Derek's arms went out, and the girl, with a\nlittle cry, came running forward and threw herself into them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Intrigue_\n\n\n\"Am I in time, Hope?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the festival is to-night. In an hour or two now. Oh Derek, if\nthe king holds this festival, the toilers will revolt. They won't stand\nit--\"\n\n\"To-night! It mustn't be held to-night! It doesn't give me time, time to\nplan.\"\n\nI stood listening to their vehement, half-whispered words. For a moment\nor two, absorbed, they ignored me.\n\n\"The king will make his choice to-night, Derek. He has announced it.\nBlanca or Sensua for his queen. And if he chooses the Crimson Sensua--\"\nShe stammered, then she went on:\n\n\"If he does--there will be bloodshed. The toilers are waiting, just to\nlearn his choice.\"\n\nDerek exclaimed, \"But to-night is too soon! I've got to plan. Hope,\nwhere does Rohbar stand in this?\"\n\nStrange intrigue! I pieced it together now, from their words, and from\nwhat presently they briefly told me. A festival was about to be held, an\norgy of feasting and merrymaking, of music and dancing. And during it,\nthis young King Leonto was to choose his queen. There were two\npossibilities. The Crimson Sensua, a profligate, debauched woman who, as\nqueen, would further oppress the workers. And Blanca, a white beauty,\nrisen from the toilers to be a favorite at the Court. Hope was her\nhandmaiden.\n\nIf Blanca were chosen, the toilers would be appeased. She was one of\nthem. She would lead this king from his profligate ways, would win from\nhim justice for the workers.\n\nBut Derek and Hope both knew that the pure and gentle Blanca would\nnever be the king's choice. And to-night the toilers would definitely\nknow it, and the smoldering revolt would burst into flame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd there was this Rohbar. Derek said, \"He is the king's henchman,\nCharlie.\"\n\nI stood here in the starlight, listening to them. This strange primitive\nrealm. There were no modern weapons here. We had brought none. The\ncurrent used in our transition would have exploded the cartridges of a\nrevolver. I had a dirk which Hope now gave me, and that was all.\n\nPrimitive intrigue. I envisaged this chaotic nation, with its toilers\nignorant as the oppressed Mexican peons at their worst. Striving to\nbetter themselves, yet, not knowing how. Ready to shout for any leader\nwho might with vainglorious words set himself up as a patriot.\n\nThis Rohbar, perhaps, was planning to do just that.\n\nAnd so was Derek! He said, \"Hope, if you could persuade the king to\npostpone the festival--if Blanca would help persuade him--just until\nto-morrow night....\"\n\n\"I can try, Derek. But the festival is planned for an hour or two from\nnow.\"\n\n\"Where is the king?\"\n\n\"In his palace, near the festival gardens.\"\n\nShe gestured to the south. My mind went back to New York City. This\nhillock, where we were standing in the starlight beside a tree, was in\nmy world about Fifth Avenue and Sixteenth Street. The king's palace--the\nfestival gardens--stood down at the Battery, where the rivers met in the\nbroad water of the harbor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDerek was saying, \"We haven't much time: can you get us to the palace?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have a cart down there on the road.\"\n\n\"And the cloaks for Charlie and me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Derek. \"We'll go with you. It's a long chance; he probably\nwon't postpone it. If he does not, we'll be among the audience. And when\nhe chooses the Red Sensua--\"\n\nShe shuddered, \"Oh, Derek--\" And I thought I heard her whisper, \"Oh,\nAlexandre--\" and I saw his finger go to his lips.\n\nHis arm went around her. She huddled, small as a child against his tall,\nmuscular body.\n\nHe said gently, \"Don't be afraid, little Hope.\"\n\nHis face was grim, his eyes were gleaming. I saw him suddenly as an\ninstinctive military adventurer. An anachronism in our modern New York\nCity. Born in a wrong age. But here in this primitive realm he was at\nhome.\n\nI plucked at him. \"How can you--how can we dare plunge into this thing?\nHidden with cloaks, yes. But you talk of leading these toilers.\"\n\nHe cast Hope away and confronted me. \"I can do it! You'll see, Charlie.\"\nHe was very strangely smiling. \"You'll see. But I don't want to come\ninto the open right away. Not to-night. But if we can only postpone this\naccursed festival.\"\n\nWe had been talking perhaps five minutes. We were ready now to start\naway. Derek said:\n\n\"Whatever comes, Charlie, I want you to take care of Hope. Guard her for\nme, will you?\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, I will try to.\"\n\nHope smiled as she held out her hand to me. \"I will not be afraid, with\nDerek's friend.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer English was of different intonation from our own, but it was her\nnative language, I could not doubt.\n\nI took her cold, slightly trembling hand. \"Thank you, Hope.\"\n\nHer eyes were misty with starlight. Tender eyes, but the tenderness was\nnot for me.\n\n\"Yes,\" I repeated. \"You can depend upon me, Derek.\"\n\nWe left the hillock. A food-laden cart came along the road. The driver,\na boy vivid in jacket and wide trousers of red and blue, bravely worn\nbut tattered, ran alongside guiding the oxen. When they had passed we\nfollowed, and presently we came to the cloaks Hope had hidden. Derek and\nI donned them. They were long crimson cloaks with hoods.\n\nHope said, \"Many are gathering for the festival shrouded like that. You\nwill not be noticed now.\"\n\nFurther along the road we reached a little eminence. I saw the river\nahead of us, and a river behind us. And a few miles to the south, an\nopen spread of water where the rivers joined. Familiar contours! The\nHudson River! The East River. And down at the end of the island, New\nYork Harbor.\n\nHope gestured that way. \"The king's palace is there.\"\n\nWe were soon passing occasional houses, primitive thatched dwellings. I\nsaw inside one. Workers were seated over their frugal evening meal.\nAlways the same vivid garments, jaunty but tattered. We passed one old\nfellow in a field, working late in the starlight. A man bent with age,\nbut still a tiller of the soil. Hope waved to him and he responded, but\nthe look he gave us as we hurried by shrouded in our crimson cloaks was\nsullenly hostile.\n\nWe came to an open cart. It stood by the roadside. An ox with shaggy\ncoat and spreading horns was fastened to the fence. It was a small cart\nwith small rollers like wheels. Seats were in it and a vivid canopy over\nit. We climbed in and rumbled away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd this starlit road in our own world was Broadway! We were presently\npassing close to the river's edge. This quiet, peaceful, starlit river!\nWhy, in our world it was massed with docks! Great ocean liners, huge\nfunneled, with storied decks lay here! Under this river, tunnels with\nendless passing vehicles! Tubes, with speeding trains crowded with\npeople!\n\nThe reality here was so different! Behind us what seemed an upper city\nwas strung along the river. Ahead of us also there were streets and\nhouses, the city of the workers. A bell was tolling. Along all the roads\nnow we could see the moving yellow spots of lights on the holiday carts\nheaded for the festival. And there were spots of yellow torchlight from\nboats on the river.\n\nWe soon were entering the city streets. Narrow dirt streets they were,\nwith primitive shacks to the sides. Women came to the doorways to stare\nat our little cart rumbling hastily past. I was conscious of my crimson\ncloak, and conscious of the sullen glances of hate which were flung at\nit from every side, here in this squalid, forlorn section where the\nworkers lived.\n\nAlong every street now the carts were passing, converging to the south.\nThey were filled, most of them, with young men and girls, all in gaudy\ncostumes. Some of them, like ourselves, were shrouded in crimson cloaks.\nThe carts occasionally were piled with flowers. As one larger than us,\nand moving faster rumbled by, a girl in it stood up and pelted me with\nblossoms. She wore a crimson robe, but it had fallen from her shoulders.\nI caught a glimpse of her face, framed in flowing dark hair, and of eyes\nwith laughter in them, mocking me, alluring.\n\nWe came at last to the end of the island. There seemed to be a thousand\nor more people arriving, or here already. The tip of the island had an\nesplanade with a broad canopy behind it. Burning torches of wood gave\nflames of yellow, red and blue fire. A throng of gay young people\npromenaded the walk, watching the arriving boats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd here, behind the walk at the water's edge, was a garden of trees and\nlawn, shrubs and beds of tall vivid flowers. Nooks were here to shelter\nlovers, pools of water glinted red and green with the reflected\ntorchlight. In one of the pools I saw a group of girls bathing,\nsportive as dolphins.\n\nTo one side at a little distance up the river, banked against the water,\nwas a broad, low building: the palace of the king. About it were broad\ngardens, with shrubs and flowers. The whole was surrounded by a high\nmetal fence, spiked on top.\n\nThe main gate was near at hand; we left our cart. Close to the gate was\na guard standing alert, a jaunty fellow in leather pantaloons and\nleather jacket, with a spiked helmet, and in his hand a huge,\nsharp-pointed lance. The gardens of the palace, what we could see of\nthem, seemed empty--none but the favored few might enter here. But as I\nclimbed from the cart, I got the impression that just inside the fence a\nfigure was lurking. It started away as we approached the gate. The guard\nhad not seen it--the drab figure of a man in what seemed to be dripping\ngarments, as though perhaps he had swum in from the water.\n\nAnd Derek saw him. He muttered, \"They are everywhere.\"\n\nHope led us to the gate. The guard recognized her. At her imperious\ngesture he stood aside. We passed within. I saw the palace now as a long\nwinged structure of timber and stone, with a high tower at the end of\none wing. The building fronted the river, but here on the garden side\nthere was a broad doorway up an incline, twenty feet up and over a small\nbridge, spanning what seemed a dry moat. Beyond it, a small platform,\nthen an oval archway, the main entrance to the building.\n\nDerek and I, shrouded in our crimson cloaks with hoods covering us to\nthe eyes, followed Hope into the palace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The King's Henchman_\n\n\nThe long room was bathed in colored lights. There was an ornate tiled\nfloor. Barbaric draperies of heavy fabric shrouded the archways and\nwindows. It was a totally barbaric apartment. It might have been the\naudience chamber of some fabled Eastern Prince of our early ages. Yet\nnot quite that either. There was a primitive modernity here. I could not\ndefine it, could not tell why I felt this strangeness. Perhaps it was\nthe aspect of the people. The room was crowded with men and gay laughing\ngirls in fancy dress costumes. Half of them at least were shrouded in\ncrimson cloaks, but most of the hoods were back. They moved about,\nlaughing and talking, evidently waiting for the time to come for them to\ngo to the festival. We pushed our way through them.\n\nDerek murmured, \"Keep your hood up, Charlie.\"\n\nA girl plucked at me. \"Handsome man, let me see.\" She thrust her painted\nlips up to mine as though daring me to kiss them. Hope shoved her away.\nHer parted cloak showed her white, beautiful body with the dark tresses\nof her hair shrouding it. Exotically lovely she was, with primitive,\nunrestrained passions--typical of the land in which she lived.\n\n\"This way,\" whispered Hope. \"Keep close together. Do not speak!\"\n\nWe moved forward and stood quietly against the wall of the room, where\ngreat curtains hid us partly from view. Under a canopy, at a table on a\nraised platform near one end of the apartment, sat the youthful monarch.\nI saw him as a man of perhaps thirty. He was in holiday garb, robed in\nsilken hose of red and white, a strangely fashioned doublet, and a\nclose-fitting shirt. Bare-headed, with thick black hair, long to the\nbase of his neck.\n\nHe sat at the table with a calm dignity. But he relaxed here in the\npresence of his favored courtiers. He was evidently in a high good humor\nthis night, giving directions for the staging of the spectacle,\ndespatching messengers. I stood gazing at him. A very kingly fellow\nthis. There was about him, that strange mingled look of barbarism and\nmodernity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHope approached him and knelt. Derek and I could hear their voices,\nalthough the babble of the crowd went on.\n\n\"My little Hope, what is it? Stand up, child.\"\n\nShe said, \"Your Highness, a message from Blanca.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Say no more! I know it already! She does not want this\nfestival. The workers,\"--what a world of sardonic contempt he put into\nthat one word!--\"the workers will be offended because we take pleasure\nto-night. Bah!\" But he was still laughing. \"Say no more, little Hope.\nTell Blanca to dance and sing her best this night. I am making my\nchoice. Did you know that?\"\n\nHope was silent. He repeated, \"Did you know that?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Highness,\" she murmured.\n\n\"I choose our queen to-night, child. Blanca or Sensua.\" He sighed. \"Both\nare very beautiful. Do you know which one I am going to choose?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n\"Nor do I, little Hope. Nor do I.\"\n\nHe dismissed her. \"Go now. Don't bother me.\"\n\nShe parted her lips as though to make another protest, but his eyes\nsuddenly flashed.\n\n\"I would not have you annoy me again. Do you understand?\"\n\nShe turned away, back toward where Derek and I were lurking. The\nchattering crowd in the room had paid no attention to Hope, but before\nshe could reach us a man detached himself from a nearby group and\naccosted her. A commanding figure, he was, I think, quite the largest\nman in the room. An inch or two taller than Derek, at the least. He wore\nhis red cloak with the hood thrown back upon his wide heavy shoulders. A\nbullet-head with close-clipped black hair. A man of about the king's\nage, he had a face of heavy features, and flashing dark eyes. A\nscoundrel adventurer, this king's henchman.\n\nHope said, \"What is it, Rohbar?\"\n\n\"You will join our party, little Hope?\" He laid a heavy hand on her\nwhite arm. His face was turned toward me. I could not miss the gleaming\nlook in his eyes as he regarded her.\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed that he twitched at her, but she broke away from him.\n\nAnger crossed his face, but the desirous look in his eyes remained.\n\n\"You are very bold, Hope, to spurn me like this.\" He had lowered his\nvoice as though fearful that the king might hear him.\n\n\"Let me alone!\" she said.\n\nShe darted away from him, but before she joined us she stood waiting\nuntil he turned away.\n\n\"No use,\" Hope whispered. \"There is nothing we can do here. You heard\nwhat the king said--and the festival is already begun.\"\n\nDerek stood a moment, lost in thought. He was gazing across the room to\nwhere Rohbar was standing with a group of girls. He said at last:\n\n\"Come on, Charlie. We'll watch this festival. This damn fool king will\nchoose the Red Sensua.\" He shrugged. \"There will be chaos....\"\n\nWe shoved our way from the room, went out of the main doorway and\nhurried through the gardens of the palace. The red-cloaked figures were\nleaving the building now for the festival grounds. We waited for a group\nof them to pass so that we might walk alone. As we neared the gate,\npassing through the shadows of high flowered shrubs, a vague feeling\nthat we were being followed shot through me. In a moment there was so\nmuch to see that I forgot it, but I held my hand on my dirk and moved\ncloser to Hope.\n\nWe reached the entrance to the canopy. A group of girls, red-cloaked,\nwere just coming out. They rushed past us. They ran, discarding their\ncloaks. Their white bodies gleamed under the colored lights as they\nrushed to the pool and dove.\n\nWe were just in time. Hope whispered, \"The king will be here any\nmoment.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeneath the canopy was a broad arena of seats. A platform, like a stage,\nwas at one end. It was brilliantly illuminated with colored torches held\naloft by girls in flowing robes, each standing like a statue with her\nlight held high. The place was crowded. In the gloom of the darkened\nauditorium we found seats off to one side, near the open edge of the\ncanopy. We sat, with Hope between us.\n\nDerek whispered, \"Shakespeare might have staged a play in a fashion like\nthis.\"\n\nA primitive theatrical performance. There was no curtain for interlude\nbetween what might have been the acts of a vaudeville. The torch girls,\nlike pages, ranged themselves in a line across the front of the stage.\nThey were standing there as we took our seats. The vivid glare of their\ntorches concealed the stage behind them.\n\nThere was a few moments wait, then, amid hushed silence, the king with\nhis retinue came in. He sat in a canopied box off to one side. When he\nwas seated, he raised his arm and the buzz of conversation in the\naudience began again.\n\nPresently the page girls moved aside from the stage. The buzz of the\naudience was stilted. The performance, destined to end so soon in\ntragedy, now began.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Crimson Murderess_\n\n\nHope murmured. \"The three-part music comes first. There will first be\nthe spiritual.\"\n\nAn orchestra was seated on the stage in a semi-circle. It was composed\nof men and women musicians, and there seemed to be over a hundred of\nthem. They sat in three groups; the center group was about to play. In a\nsolemn hush the leaderless choirs, with all its players garbed in\nwhite, began its first faint note. I craned to get a clear view of the\nstage. This white choir seemed almost all wood-wind. There were tiny\npipes in little series such as Pan might have used. Flutes, and\nflageolets; and round-bellied little instruments of clay, like ocarinas.\nAnd pitch-pipes, long and slender as a marsh reed.\n\nIn a moment I was lost in the music. It began softly, with single muted\nnotes from a single instrument, echoed by the others, running about the\nchoir like a will-o'-the-wisp. It was faint, as though very far away,\nmade more sweet by distance. And then it swelled, came nearer.\n\nI had never heard such music as this. Primitive! It was not that. Nor\nbarbaric! Nothing like the music of our ancient world. Nor was it what I\nmight conceive to be the music of our future. A thing apart, unworldly,\nethereal. It swept me, carried me off; it was an exaltation of the\nspirit lifting me. It was triumphant now. It surged, but there was in\nits rhythm, the beat of its every instrument, nothing but the soul of\npurity. And then it shimmered into distance again, faint and exquisite\nmusic of a dream. Crooning, pleading, the speech of whispering angels.\n\nIt ceased. There was a storm of applause.\n\nI breathed again. Why, this was what music might be in our world but was\nnot. I thought of our blaring jazz.\n\nHope said, \"Now they play the physical music. Then Sensua will dance\nwith Blanca. We will see then which one the king chooses.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the stage all the torches were extinguished save those which were\nred. The arena was darker than before. The stage was bathed with a deep\ncrimson. Music of the physical senses! It was, indeed, no more like the\nother choir than is the body to the spirit.\n\nThere were stringed instruments playing now; deep-toned, singing\nzithers, and instruments of rounded, swelling bodies, like great viols\nwith sensuous, throbbing voices. Music with a swift rhythm, marked by\nthe thump of hollow gourds. It rose with its voluptuous swell into a\npaean of abandonment, and upon the tide of it, the crimson Sensua flung\nherself upon the stage. She stood motionless for a moment that all might\nregard her. The crimson torchlight bathed her, stained crimson the white\nflush of her limbs, her heavy shoulders, her full, rounded throat.\n\nA woman in her late twenties. Voluptuous of figure, with crimson veils\nhalf-hiding, half-revealing it. A face of coarse, sensuous beauty. A\nface wholly evil, and it seemed to me wholly debauched. Dark eyes with\nbeaded lashes. Heavy lips painted scarlet. A pagan woman of the streets.\nOne might have encountered such a woman swaggering in some ancient\nstreet of some ancient city, flaunting the finery given her by a rich\nand profligate eastern prince.\n\nShe stood a moment with smoldering, passion-filled eyes, gazing from\nbeneath her lowered lids. Her glance went to the king's canopy, and\nflashed a look of confidence, of triumph. The king answered it with a\nsmile. He leaned forward over his railing, watching her intently.\n\nWith the surge of the music she moved into her dance. Slowly she began,\nquite slowly. A posturing and swaying of hips like a nautch girl. She\nmade the rounds of the musicians, leering at them. She stood in the\nwhirl of the music, almost ignoring it, stood at the front of the stage\nwith a gaze of slumberous, insolent passion flung at the king. A knife\nwas in her hand now. She held it aloft. The red torchlight caught its\nnaked blade. With shuddering fancy I seemed to see it dripping crimson.\nShe frowned, and struck it at a phantom lover. She backed away. She\nstooped and knelt. She knelt and seemed with her empty arms to be\ncaressing a murdered lover's head. She kissed him, rained upon his dead\nlips her macabre kisses.\n\nAnd then she was up on her bare feet, again circling the stage. Her\nanklets clanked as she moved with the tread of a tigress. The musicians\nshrank from her waving blade.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA girl in white veils was suddenly disclosed standing at the back of the\nstage.\n\nDerek whispered, \"Is that Blanca?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" whispered Hope.\n\nBlanca stood watching her rival. The crimson Sensua passed her, took her\nsuddenly by the wrist, drew her forward. For an instant I thought it\nmight have been rehearsed. I saw Blanca as a slim, gentle girl in white,\nwith a white head-dress. A dancer who could symbolize purity, now in the\ngrip of red passion.\n\nAn instant, and then horror struck us. And I could feel it surge over\nthe audience. A gasp of horror. The frightened girl in white tried to\nescape. The musicians wavered and broke. I stared, stricken, with\nfreezing blood. Upon the stage the knife went swiftly up; it came down;\nthen up again. The red Sensua stood gloating. The knife she waved aloft\nwas truly dripping crimson now.\n\nWith a choked, gasping scream the white girl of the toilers crumpled and\nfell.... She lay motionless, at the feet of the crimson murderess.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_\"Why, This Is Treason!\"_\n\n\nThere was a gasp. The audience sat frozen. On the stage, with no one\nlifting a hand to stop her, the crimson murderess made a leap and\nvanished. A moment, and then the spell broke. A girl in the audience\nscreamed. Some one moved to stand up and overturned a seat with a crash.\n\nThe amphitheater under the canopy broke into a pandemonium. Screams and\nshouts, crashing of seats, screaming, frightened people struggling to\nget out of the darkness. The torches on the stage were dropped and\nextinguished. The darkness leaped upon us.\n\nDerek and I were gripping Hope. We were struck by a bench flung backward\nfrom in front. People were rushing at us. We were swept along in the\npanic of the crowd.\n\nI heard Derek shout, \"We must keep together!\"\n\nWe fought, but we were swept backward. We found ourselves outside the\ncanopy. Torchlight was here. It glimmered on the pool of water. People\nwere everywhere rushing past us, some one way, some another. Aimless,\nwith the shock of terror upon them. Under the canopy they were still\nscreaming.\n\nI was momentarily separated from Derek and Hope. I very nearly stumbled\ninto the pool. A girl was here, crouched on the stone bank. Her wet\ncrimson veils clung to her white body. Her long, wet hair lay on her. I\nstumbled against her. She raised her face. Eyes, wide with terror. Mute,\npainted red lips....\n\nI heard Derek calling again, \"Charlie!\" I shoved my way back to him. The\ncrowd was thinning out around us. Girls were climbing from the pool,\nrushing off in terror, to mingle with the milling throng. Among the\ncrowd now, down by the edge of the bay, I saw the sinister figures of\nmen come running. The toilers, miraculously appearing everywhere! I saw,\nacross the pool, a terrified girl crouching. A huge man in a black cloak\ncame leaping. The colored lights in the trees glittered on his upraised\nknife blade as it descended. The girl fell with a shuddering scream. The\nmurderer turned and whirled away into the crowd.\n\n\"Charlie!\"\n\nI was back with Derek and Hope. Hope stood trembling, with her hand\npressed against her mouth. Derek gripped me.\n\n\"That cloak, get it off!\" He ripped his crimson cloak from him and\ntossed it away. He jerked mine off. \"Too dangerous! That's the crimson\nbadge of death to-night.\"\n\nWe stood revealed in the clothes of our own world. My business suit, in\nwhich that day I had worked in Wall Street. Derek in his swagger\nuniform. He stood drawn to his full height, a powerful figure. The wires\nof our mechanism showed at his wrists. They dangled at the back of his\nneck, mounting to that strangely fashioned electrode clamped to his\nhead. Strange, awe-inspiring figure of a man!\n\nWe were momentarily alone under the colored lights of the trees. Hope\nmurmured, \"But they will see us--see you....\"\n\nDerek's face was grim, but at her words he laughed harshly. \"See us!\nWhat matter?\" He swung on me. \"It forces our hand; we've got to come out\nin the open now! This murder--this king! My God, what a fool to let\nhimself get into such a condition as this! His people--this chaos--what\na fool!\"\n\nHe had drawn his dirk. I realized that I was holding mine. Near us the\nbody of a crimson noble was lying under a tree. A sword was there on the\nground. Derek sprang for it, waved it aloft.\n\nI think that no more than a minute or two had passed since the murder.\nDown by the water the boats were hastily loading and leaving the dock.\nOne of them overturned. There were screams everywhere. Red forms lay\ninert upon the ground where they had been trampled, or stabbed. But the\nprowling figures of the toilers now seemed to have vanished.\n\nDerek gestured. \"Look at the palace! The garden!\"\n\nBeyond the canopy I could see the dim gardens surrounding the palace. I\nglimpsed the high fence, and the gateway in front. A mob of toilers was\nthere. The guard at the gate had fled. The mob was surging through. Men\nand women in the vivid garments of the fields, armed with sticks and\nclubs and stones and the implements of agriculture. They milled at the\ngate; rushed through; scattered over the garden. Their shouts floated\nback to us in a blended murmur.\n\nWe were standing only a dozen feet from the edge of the pavilion. No one\nseemed yet to have noticed us. A few straggling lights had come on under\nthe canopy. I could see the dead lying there in the wreckage of\noverturned seats.\n\nDerek said, \"We can't help it--it's done. Look at them! They're\nattacking the palace!\"\n\nThis mob springing miraculously into existence! I realized that the\ntoilers had planned that if Sensua were chosen they would attack the\nfestival. The murder of Blanca had come as big a surprise to them as to\nus....\n\n\"Come on! Can you get into the palace, Hope? The king must have gotten\nback there. Get your wits, girl!\" Derek stood gripping her, shaking her.\n\n\"Yea, there's an underground passage. He probably went that way.\"\n\nFrom the palace gardens the shouts of the mob sounded louder now. And\nfrom within the building there was an alarm bell tumultuously clanging.\n\nHope gasped, \"This way.\"\n\nShe led us back into the pavilion. We clambered over its broken seats,\npast its grewsome huddled figures. Some were still moving.... We went to\na small door under the platform. A dim room was here, deserted now.\nAgainst the wall was a large wardrobe closet; stage costumes were\nhanging in it. The closet was fully twenty feet deep. We pushed our way\nthrough the hanging garments. Hope fumbled at the blank board wall in\nthe rear. Her groping fingers found a secret panel. A door swung aside\nand a rush of dank cool air came at us. The dark outlines of a tunnel\nstretched ahead.\n\n\"In, Charlie!\"\n\nI crouched and stepped through the door. Hope closed it behind us. The\ntunnel passage was black, but soon we began to see its vague outlines.\nDerek, sword in hand, led us. I clutched my dirk. We went perhaps five\nhundred feet. Down at first, then up again. I figured we were under the\npalace gardens now, as the tunnel was winding to the left. There were\noccasional small lights.\n\nDerek whispered to Hope, \"The toilers don't know of this?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Where does it bring us out?\" I whispered.\n\n\"Into the lower floor of the castle. The king must have gone this way.\nThere might be a guard, Derek. What will you do?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"I can handle this mob. Disperse it! You'll see! And handle\nthe king.\" He laughed again grimly. \"There is no Blanca to choose now.\"\n\nThe tunnel went round a sharp angle and began steeply ascending. Derek\nstopped.\n\n\"How much further, Hope?\"\n\n\"Not far,\" she whispered.\n\nWe crept forward. The tunnel was more like a small corridor now. Beyond\nDerek's crouching figure, in the dimness I could see a doorway. Derek\nturned and gestured to us to keep back. A palace guard was standing\nthere. His pike went up.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"A friend.\"\n\nBut the man lunged with his pike. Derek leaped aside. His sword flashed;\nthe flat of it struck the fellow in the face. Derek, with incredible\nswiftness, was upon him. They went down together and before the man\ncould shout, Derek had struck him on the head with the sword hilt. The\nguard lay motionless. Derek climbed up as we ran forward to join him.\n\nI noticed now, for the first time, that in his left hand Derek held a\nsmall metal cylinder. A weapon, strange to me, which he had brought with\nhim. He had not mentioned it. He had produced it, when menaced by this\nguard. Then he evidently decided not to use it.\n\nHe shoved it back in his pocket. He whirled on us, panting. \"Hurry!\nClose that door!\"\n\nWe closed the door of the tunnel.\n\n\"Charlie, help me move him!\"\n\nWe dragged the prostrate figure of the unconscious guard aside into a\nshadow of the wall. We were in a lower room of the palace. It seemed\nmomentarily unoccupied. Overhead we could hear the footsteps of running\npeople. A confusion in the palace, and outside in the garden the shouts\nof the menacing throng of toilers. And above it all, the wild clanging\nof the alarm bell from the palace tower.\n\nDerek said swiftly, \"Get us to the king!\"\n\nHope led us through the castle corridors, and up a flight of steps to\nthe main floor. The rooms here were thronged with terrified\npeople--crimson nobles in their bedraggled finery of the festival. In\nall the chaos no one seemed to notice us.\n\nWe mounted another staircase. We found a vacant room; through its\nwindows we looked a moment, gazing into the garden. It was jammed with a\nmenacing mob, which milled about, leaderless, waving crude weapons,\nshouting imprecations at the palace. At the foot of the main steps the\nthrong stood packed, but none dared to mount. A group of the palace\nguards stood on the platform over the moat.\n\nDerek turned away impatiently. \"Let's get to the king.\"\n\nWe mounted to the upper story. The castle occupants stared at Derek and\nme as we passed them. A group of girls at the head of the staircase fled\nbefore us.\n\n\"The king,\" Derek demanded, \"Which is his apartment? Hurry, Hope, we've\nno time now!\"\n\nWe found the frightened king seated on a couch with his counsellors\naround him. It was a small room in this top story of the castle, with\nlong windows to the floor. I saw that they gave onto a balcony which\noverlooked the gardens. There were perhaps twenty or thirty people\nhuddled in the room. A confusion existed here as everywhere else--no one\nknowing what to do in this crisis. And that cursed alarm bell wildly\nadding to the turmoil. We paused at the doorway.\n\n\"Now,\" whispered Derek. He drew himself to his full height. His eyes\nwere flashing. It was a Derek I had not seen before; he wore an air of\nmastery. As though he, and not the frightened, trembling monarch on the\ncouch, were master here. And as I stared at him that instant in this\nprimitive chaotic environment, the power of him swept me. A conqueror.\nThe strange electrode clamped to his head gave him an aspect miraculous,\nawe inspiring.\n\nHe strode forward across the apartment. The king was just giving some\nfutile, vague command to be transmitted to his guards down below. A hush\nfell over the room at our appearance. The king half stood up, then sank\nback.\n\n\"Why--why--who--\"\n\nI saw Rohbar here. His long crimson cloak hung from his shoulders, with\nits hood thrown back. Beneath it, as it parted in front, his leather\nuniform was visible. A sword was strapped to his waist. He was striding\nback and forth with folded arms, frowning, but his gaze was very keen.\nRohbar was not frightened. He seemed rather to be gauging the situation,\npondering how he might turn it to his own ends. He stopped short and\nswung about to face us. His jaw dropped with surprise, amazement, at our\nstrangeness.\n\nDerek confronted him. His bulk, and huge weight towered even over Derek.\nThe king gasped and sat helplessly staring.\n\nRohbar spoke first. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"This mob must be dispersed. Don't stand looking at me like that, man!\"\n\nDerek spoke in friendly fashion, but vehemently. \"This is no time for\nexplanations.\"\n\nThey were menacing each other. Rohbar's heavy hand fell to his sword,\nbut Derek boldly pushed him away. He faced the king.\n\n\"Your Majesty....\"\n\nThe king stared blankly at him. The title was no doubt strange to this\nrealm, but no stranger than Derek's aspect.\n\n\"Your Majesty....\"\n\nBut the noise from the garden, the confusion which now broke out in the\nroom, and that damnable clattering bell, drowned his words.\n\nThe king found his voice. \"Be quiet, all of you!\" He was on his feet. He\ndemanded of Derek again, \"Who are you?\"\n\nDerek said swiftly, \"I'll show you. I can disperse this mob! Charlie,\ncome.\"\n\nIt seemed as though the gaze of everyone in the room went to me. I drew\nmyself up and flashed defiance back at them. And I followed Derek to one\nof the balcony windows. He went through it, with me after him. I stood\nat the threshold, watchful of the room behind us. Rohbar was standing\naside, and I saw now the woman Sensua with him. They were whispering,\nstaring at me and Derek.\n\nI had been wondering why, when Sensua must have known that the king\nwould choose her--why she had dared to murder her rival. I thought\nnow--as I saw her with Rohbar--that I could guess the reason. She loved\nRohbar, not the king. Rohbar was plotting to put himself on the throne,\nusing Sensua as a lover to that end. He had doubtless persuaded her to\nthis murder, knowing it would arouse the toilers, precipitate this chaos\nwhich was what he wanted. Scheming scoundrel! I could not forget the\nlook of desire on his face as he had accosted Hope....\n\nAnd now Derek appeared, to add an unknown element to Rohbar's plans.\nThere was no way he could guess who or what we were. I saw that he was\npuzzled, was whispering to Sensua about us, doubtless wondering how to\nhandle us.\n\nI saw too, that there were half a dozen crimson cloaked men here who\nwere not frightened. They had gathered in a group. They stood with hands\nupon their swords, eyeing me, and watching Rohbar--as though at a sign\nfrom him they would rush me.\n\nOn the balcony Derek stood with the light from the room upon him. The\ncrowd saw him. The main gateway of the palace was just under his\nbalcony. The crowd had now started up the steps to where the guards were\nstanding at the top. At the sight of Derek the mob let out a roar, and\nthose on the steps retreated down again.\n\nDerek stood at the balcony rail, silent, with upraised arms, gazing down\nupon the menacing throng. There was a moment of startled silence as he\nappeared. Then the shout broke out louder than before. The crowd was\nmilling and pushing, but still leaderless. An aimless activity. Someone\nthrew a stone. It came hurtling up. It missed Derek and struck the\ncastle wall, falling almost at my feet.\n\nDerek did not move. He stood calmly gazing down; stood like an orator\nwaiting for the confusion to die before he would speak.\n\nFrom the platform, just beneath Derek, the guards were staring\nwonderingly up, awed, startled. To the right a wing of the building\nturned an angle. The castle tower was there: it rose perhaps a hundred\nfeet higher than our balcony. On the railed platform-balcony girding its\ntop I saw the figures of other guards standing, gazing down at Derek.\nThe clanging bell up there was suddenly stilled.\n\nI became aware of the king close behind me. His voice rang out: \"What\nare you doing? How dare you?\"\n\nDerek whirled, \"You fool! To what a pass you have come! Your people in\narms against you....\"\n\nHis violent words brought the king's anger. \"How dare you! This is\ntreason!\"\n\nI stood alert, with my hand upon my dirk.\n\nThere would be conflict here, I felt that we could not hold it off more\nthan a moment longer. My mind leaped to that metal cylinder Derek had\nconcealed. A weapon? Then why did he not have it out now? His eyes were\nflashing. The aspect of power, of confidence, upon him was unmistakable.\nIt heartened me. I took a step toward him.\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"Wait, Charlie.\"\n\nThe king gasped again. \"How dare you? Why, this is treason! Rohbar,\nseize him!\"\n\nHope was beside me, her eyes watching the room. Rohbar came striding\nforward. Derek rasped, \"You perhaps have some sense! Lead His Majesty\naway. Take care of him until this is over.\"\n\nThey stood with crossing glances. And upon Rohbar's face a look, queerly\nsinister, had come. A smile, sardonic.\n\nHe said abruptly to the king, \"I think we should let him have his way.\nWhat harm?\"\n\nHe gestured and Sensua came forward. The crimson murderess! Her\nvoluptuous figure was shrouded in a crimson cloak. Her heavy painted\nlips smiled at the King. Her rounded white arms went over his shoulders.\n\n\"Leonto, do as Rohbar says. Let this stranger try. It can do no harm.\"\n\nThe king yielded to her; I watched as she and Rohbar urged him through\nan archway that gave into the adjoining apartment.\n\nNo wonder Rohbar was sardonically smiling! Derek had played into his\nhand. We did not know it then, but we were soon to find it out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_\"Alexandre--\"_\n\n\nDerek turned back to the balcony. It had been a brief interlude. The mob\nin the garden, the soldiers at the top of the stairway, and the other\nguards high on the bridge of the tower were all standing gazing. Shouts\nagain arose as Derek appeared. Again he raised his arms. This time his\nvoice rang out.\n\n\"Silence all of you! I am a friend! Silence!\"\n\nAt first they did not heed him; then someone shouted:\n\n\"Quiet! Listen to him! Let him talk!\"\n\nThe crowd was bellowing, and then they ceased. The bell was still. In\nthe hush came Derek's voice:\n\n\"I am a friend. I come from foreign lands, from distant lands of strange\npeople and strange magic.\"\n\nFor answer the crowd shouted and milled in confusion. A stone came up\nand then another. Derek stood immovable, like a statue gazing down at\nthem.\n\n\"I command you to disperse. You will not? Then look at me! Look at me,\nall of you. My will is law beyond this king--beyond these palace\nsoldiers--beyond any power you have ever known.\"\n\nThen I knew a part of Derek's purpose! He had pressed the mechanism at\nhis wrist. He stood imperious with upraised arms. The garden was in a\ntumult, but in a moment it died. A wave of horror swept the crowd. A\nfreezing, incredulous horror. They stood staring, incredulous, silent,\nswept with a widening wave of horror.\n\nThe figure of Derek on the balcony was fading, turning luminous. A\nwraith, a ghost of his menacing shape standing there. It faded until it\nwas almost gone, and then, as he reversed the mechanism, it materialized\nagain. A moment passed, then he stood again solid before them.\n\nHis voice rang out, \"Will you obey me now? I am a friend of the\ntoilers!\"\n\nThey were prostrate before him. There is no fear more terrible than the\nfear of the supernatural. In all of history there has been in our world\nno worship more abject than the worship and fear of a primitive people\nfor its supernatural God. On the platform beneath the balcony, the\npalace soldiers stared up, horrified. Then they too were prostrate\nbefore Derek's threatening gestures and commanding voice.\n\nI stood watching, listening. And suddenly, from the prostrate crowd, a\nman leaped up. In the silence his amazed voice carried over the garden.\n\n\"Alexandre! It is our Prince Alexandre! Our lost prince!\"\n\nHe stood staring at Derek, his arms gesturing to his comrade around him.\nHe shouted it again:\n\n\"Our rightful king, come back to us! Don't you recognize him? _I_ saw\nhim go! He went like that--fading into a ghost. Ten years ago, when\nLeonto killed his father and would have killed him had he not escaped!\"\n\nThe crowd was standing up now. They recognized Derek! There was no doubt\nof it. The garden was ringing with the tumultuous shouts,\n\n\"Alexandre! Our lost prince has come back to us!\"\n\nMy head was whirling with it. Derek, prince of this realm? I could see\nthat it was true. Escaped from here as a young lad, when his throne was\nusurped. Returning now, a man, to claim his own.\n\nAnd suddenly he turned and flashed me his smile.\n\nThe din from the garden drowned his words. The crowd was shouting:\n\"Alexandre! Our lost prince!\"\n\nThe king's guards on the lower platform stood sullen, confused. I heard\nfootsteps behind me. I whirled around.\n\nFrom the room, the group of Rohbar's crimson nobles were rushing toward\nme! Their swords were out. One of them shouted, \"Kill them now! We must\nkill them and have done!\"\n\nThere were five or six men in the group. They were no more than ten feet\naway from me. They came leaping.\n\nI stood in the window opening, with only my dirk to oppose them. I\nshouted, \"Derek! Derek!\"\n\nI think I took a step backward. I was out on the balcony. It flashed\nover me--Derek and I were caught out here!\n\nThe first of the red cloaked figures came hurtling through the doorway.\nI leaped to avoid his sword. I saw the others crowding behind him.\n\nThen I felt Derek shove me violently aside. I half fell, but recovered\nmyself at the balcony rail. Five of the crimson nobles were on the\nbalcony. Derek confronted them. His aspect made them pause. They stood,\nwith outstretched swords. The garden was silent; the crowd stared up.\nAnd in the silence Derek roared,\n\n\"Get back! All of you, go back inside! Back, or I'll kill you!\"\n\nIn Derek's right hand he held the cylinder outstretched, leveled at the\nmenacing nobles.\n\n\"Back, I say!\"\n\nBut instead they rushed him. There was a flash. From the cylinder it\nseemed that a ray spat out, a flash of silver light. It caught the three\nmen who were in advance of the others. Their swords dropped with a\nclatter to the balcony floor. They stood, transfixed.\n\nAn instant. Derek's silver ray played upon them. Their red cloaks were\npainted with its silver sheen.\n\nThey were shimmering! I gasped, staring. The other nobles, beyond the\nray, had fallen back. And they too stood staring in horror.\n\nAnother instant The three figures wavered. I saw the face of one of\nthem, with the shock of incredulous horror still upon it. A face turning\nluminous! A face, erased, with only the staring eyes to mark where it\nhad been!\n\nThere was a moment when the three stricken men stood like shimmering\nghosts, with Derek's deadly ray upon them. Then they were gone! It\nseemed, just as they vanished, that they were falling through the\nbalcony floor....\n\nDerek snapped off his ray. He rasped, \"Back into that room, I tell you!\"\n\nThe remaining nobles fled before him. He turned again to the balcony\nrail.\n\n\"My people--yes, I am Alexandre--I had not thought you would recognize\nme so soon. But you are right--the time has come for me to claim my\ninheritance. And I will rule you justly.\"\n\nHis cylinder was still in his hand; he swept a watchful glance behind\nhim. I thought of Rohbar. He was in the next room, with the king. Had\nthey seen this attack upon Derek? They must have heard the crowd\nshouting, \"Alexandre!\" It seemed strange they did not appear.\n\nI recall now, as I look back to this moment on the balcony, that I\nsuddenly thought of Hope. She had been beside me just before the nobles\nattacked. I did not see her now. I was startled, but thought of her was\ndriven from my mind. From within the palace a scream sounded. A girl\nscreaming.\n\nBut it was not Hope's voice. A girl, screaming, and then shouting:\n\n\"The king is dead!\"\n\nDerek came rushing at me. \"Charlie, that--\"\n\nWe heard it again. \"The king is dead!\"\n\nWe hurried into the adjoining room. There was no one to stop us--no one\nup here now who dared oppose Derek. The terrified nobles in the room\nfell cringing before him.\n\n\"Alexandre--spare us! We are loyal to you!\"\n\nHe strode past them. In the adjacent apartment we found the king lying\nupon the floor. A wound in his throat welled crimson. He had evidently\nbeen lying here alone, and had just now been found by a girl who had\nentered. He was not quite dead. Derek bent over him. He opened his eyes.\n\nHe gasped faintly: \"Rohbar--killed me. Rohbar and that--accursed crimson\nSensua....\"\n\nHis voice trailed away. The light went out of his staring eyes. Derek\nlaid him gently back on the floor.\n\nAnd as though already the news of his death had miraculously spread, the\nbell in the castle tower began tolling. Not clanging now. Tolling, with\nslow, solemn accent. The crowd evidently recognized it. We could hear\nthe shouts: \"Death! Death has come!\"\n\nDerek's eyes ware blazing as he stood up. \"The end, Charlie! I would not\nhave planned this, and yet....\"\n\nHe did not finish. He whirled, rushed back to the other room and to the\nbalcony. The scene was again in confusion the crowd milling, voices\nshouting:\n\n\"The king is dead!\"\n\nAt the edge of the garden a woman's shrill, hysterical laughter rose\nover the din.\n\nDerek called, \"Yes, the king is dead!\" He paused. Then he added, \"If you\nwant me--if I have your loyalty--I will claim my throne.\"\n\nA tumult interrupted him. \"Alexandre! King Alexandre!\"\n\nHe spread his arms, but he could not silence them.\n\n\"The king is dead. Long live King Alexandre!\"\n\nA wave of it swept over the garden, engulfing the castle. At the main\nentrance Leonto's soldiers stood sullen, listening to it.\n\nDerek stood triumphant. His hands were outstretched, palms down. But up\non the circular bridge at the top of the tower there was a sudden\ncommotion. The soldiers up there had vanished, moved back within the\ntower to make room for other figures. I stared amazed, transfixed. A\nhuge man in leather garments was there, with a sword stuck in his wide\nbelt. A man with a bullet head, a heavy face, gazing down....\n\nRohbar!\n\nAnd held in front of him the slender figure of a girl. Hope! He clutched\nher, his thick arm encircling her breast. With sinking heart I realized\nwhat had happened. Hope had moved away from me. Every one in the room\nhad been intent upon Derek. Rohbar had come quietly in, after murdering\nthe king, had seized Hope, stifled her outcry, and had taken her up into\nthe tower.\n\nAnd I had promised Derek that I would shield this girl from harm! The\nhorror of it--the self-condemnation of it--swept me, froze me to\nnumbness. I could not think; I could only stand and stare. Rohbar held\nHope like a shield before him. The low railing hardly reached her knees.\nA sheer drop to the garden beneath. He held her tightly, and in his free\nhand I saw his dirk come up menacingly against her white throat. His\nvoice called:\n\n\"Silent, down there! Alexandre, you traitor! Silence!\"\n\nDerek stared up. The triumph faded from him. He stared, stricken. The\ncrowd stared. The soldiers on the lower platform ceased their shouting\nand gazed up at these new actors, come so unexpectedly upon the stage.\nAgain Rohbar called, to the guards this time:\n\n\"I represent your King Leonto. This Alexandre is a traitor to us all.\nAnd he cannot harm me! I defy him. Look at him! I defy him to use his\nevil weapon upon me!\"\n\nDerek was silent. A single adverse move and Rohbar's knife would stab\ninto Hope's throat. Derek's ray was powerless. A flash from it would\nhave killed Hope, not Rohbar.\n\nThe king's soldiers saw Derek's indecision. One of them shouted, \"He\ncannot harm us! Look, he is frightened!\"\n\nThe crowd recognized Hope. They began calling her name. And calling,\n\"Master Rohbar, do not harm our Hope!\"\n\n\"I will not harm her! Not if you do what I tell you! Leave the\ngarden--go quietly! I will deal with this traitor!\"\n\nHe added to the guards, \"Go up and seize him! He cannot hurt you!\nTraitor! Seize him! If he does not yield--if any of this crowd attacks\nyou--then I will kill Hope.\"\n\nDerek stood clinging to the balcony rail. With Rohbar's watchful gaze\nupon him he did not dare turn or move. I was standing back from the\nbalcony, behind Derek and partly in the room. No one thought of me. No\none from outside could see me. And I, who had played no part in this,\nsave that one I had neglected, suddenly saw my role. My cue was\nsounding. My role to play, here upon this tumultuous stage.\n\nI turned back into the dim room. A few frightened men and girls were\nhere. They were all crowding forward, gazing through the windows at the\nscene outside. No one noticed me, but I saw, with sudden realization, my\nrole to play.\n\nI darted across the room, out into the dim, deserted corridor of the\ncastle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_My Role to Play_\n\n\nI slipped like a shadow through the almost empty corridors. Down on the\nlower floor I found that many of the soldiers were on the inside,\nstanding about the corridors in groups, waiting for word from their\ncomrades on the platform to indicate what action they should take. My\ntime was short; I knew that within a few minutes they would be rushing\nup to overpower Derek.\n\nI stood unseen against the wall near the main entrance. I could not get\noutside. There were too many soldiers there.\n\nI tried to keep my sense of direction. The wing upon which the tower\nstood was about two hundred feet from me here. If I could not get\noutside I would have to try the inside, along this corridor. I prayed\nthat I might not make an error. I tried to gauge exactly where the tower\nwould be.\n\nThe hallway was almost dark and in this wing there chanced to be no one\nat the moment. I came to the angle and turned it to the left. I was\nunarmed save my dirk. I drew it. But I encountered no one. I passed the\ndoors of many empty rooms. The windows were all barred on this lower\nfloor. I could hear the shouts of the crowd outside.\n\nI came at last to the end of the wing. A staircase here led upward. I\nguessed that I was directly under the tower now, and that this staircase\nundoubtedly led upward into it. I mounted a few steps to verify what I\nwas sure would be the condition. It was as I thought. Rohbar had won\nover the soldiers who were here. He had sent them down from the tower\nbridge. They were guarding this staircase.\n\nI crept up another few steps, very cautiously. I could hear their voices\non the stairs. A light was up there. I could see the legs of some of\nthem as they crowded the stairs. I softly retreated.\n\nThere was no way of getting up into the tower here. Alone and armed only\nwith my dirk, I could not mount these stairs and assail a dozen armed\nmen standing above me; especially when, if I raised an alarm, Rohbar\noverhead might be startled into killing Hope.\n\nI stood another moment, thinking, planning my actions. I was trembling.\nEverything depended upon me now. I must get up into the tower. And,\nabove everything, haste was necessary.\n\nI retreated back to the lower floor. I was still some twenty feet above\nthe ground, I judged. That was too far. A dozen paces along the hall I\nsaw a stairway leading downward into the ground level cellar of the\ncastle. I marked in my mind exactly in which direction I turned, and how\nfar. I went down the stairs.\n\nThere was an empty lower room. It was pitch black. I lay down on its\nearthen floor. Above me, a few paces off to one side I could visualize\nthe tower. A hundred and fifty feet above me, at least, up to that\nbridge balcony, where Rohbar stood with Hope. I kept my mind on it and\nprayed that I might not be making an error, a miscalculation.\n\nI prayed, too, that luck would be with me. A desperate chance, yet I\nthought I knew what was here, or about here, in New York City. I lay on\nmy side, alone in the blackness, and pressed the switch at my wrist....\n\nThe familiar sensation of the transition began. The darkness grew\nluminous. Around me shadows were taking form. My body was humming,\nthrilling with the vibrations within it. I could feel the ground under\nme seeming to melt. My head was reeling. Nausea swept me, but with it\nall I tried to keep my wits. I must watch this new Space into which I\nwas going. Space? I prayed that here on this spot in New York City there\nwould be empty space! If not, at the first warning, I was prepared to\nstop my mechanism.\n\nThe shadows grew around me. There was a moment or two when I felt as\nthough I were floating. Weightless. The sense of my body hovering in a\nvoid, intangible, imponderable, with only my struggling mentality\nholding it together....\n\nAnd then I felt myself materializing. Around me walls were taking form.\nI floated down a foot or two and came to rest upon a new floor. My hand\nbrushed it. My physical senses were returning. I could feel a floor of\nconcrete. A vague, shimmering light was near me. It seemed to outline\nthe rectangle of a window. All around was darkness. Empty darkness.\nSoundless, with only the throbbing hum of the mechanism....\n\nI was indoors, in a room. I felt suddenly almost normal, except for the\nwhirring vibration. I flung the switch again. There was a shock. A\nwhirling of my senses. Then I sat up; my head steadied. The nausea\npassed.\n\nI was back in my own world, in New York City. This was night: I tried to\ncalculate the time. Derek and I had departed about midnight. This would\nbe, then some time before dawn. I was in a cellar room, lying on its\ncement floor. There was a window, with a faint light outside it. A\nwindow up near the ceiling. A straggling illumination showed me a bin, a\nfew barrels, a door leading into another room which looked as though it\nmight be a machine shop.\n\nI sat up, calculating. I was a thousand feet perhaps from the Battery\nwall, two hundred feet from the Hudson River. This was an office\nbuilding, and I was in one of its cellar rooms, at the ground level.\n\nNear dawn? I tried to calculate what might be overhead. A deserted\noffice building. Too early yet for the scrub-women. The elevator would\nnot be running. I laughed to myself. Of what use to me an elevator, if\nit had been running? How could I, a midnight prowler, appear from the\ncellar of this building, and demand to be taken upstairs! There would be\nno elevator, but there would be watchmen. I would avoid them.\n\nI found a door. My heart leaped with a sudden fear that it would be\nlocked, but it was not. I went through it into a passage and found the\nstaircase. I made two turns. I tried again to keep my mind on this Space\nhere. I stood, carefully thinking. I had it clear. I had made no move\nwithout careful thought. The tower with Rohbar was still to my left, and\nabout directly above me.\n\nI went up the short stone staircase, opened another door carefully. I\nwas in the dim lower hall of the office building. I found myself beside\nthe deserted elevator shaft. A light was burning on the night\nattendant's table in an alcove, on the other side of the shaft. He sat\nthere with his back to me. I closed the door soundlessly.\n\nThe stairway upward beside the elevator was here. I watched my chance. I\ndarted around the angle and went up. I met no one. The concrete\nstaircase had a light at each floor. Four floors up. No, not enough! I\nopened the fourth floor door. The marble hall of the office building was\nempty and silent. Rows of locked office doors with their gold-leaf names\nand numbers. A single dim light to illumine the silent emptiness....\n\nI retreated into the staircase shaft and mounted higher. My dirk was in\nmy hand. Charlie Wilson, the Wall Street brokerage clerk, prowling\nhere! And upon what a strange adventure!\n\nI came to what I thought was the proper floor. In the hall I selected a\nroom. The door was securely locked. I had no way of breaking the lock,\nbut the panel was of opaque glass. I would have to chance the noise. I\nrushed the length of the hall, to where a red fire-ax hung in a bracket.\nI came back with it. I smashed the glass panel of the door.\n\nWould a watchman hear me? I did not wait to find out. With the ax I\nscraped away the splinters of glass. I climbed through the opening. My\nhand was cut, but I did not heed it.\n\nI was in a dim, silent office, with rugs on the floor, desks standing\nabout, filing cases, a water-cooler, and a safe in the corner. I rushed\nto one of the windows. It looked over Battery Park and the upper bay.\nThe stars were shining, but to the east over Brooklyn I could see them\npaling with the coming dawn. I gazed down to try and calculate my\nheight. Yes, this would be about right. And my position. I could see the\noutline of the shore, the trees of Battery Park, the busy harbor, even\nat this hour before dawn, thronged with the moving lights of its boats.\n\nI saw all this with my eyes, but with my mind I saw the wrecked,\ndeserted pavilion, and the gardens of Leonto's castle. The threatening\nmob would be below me. The palace entrance would be here to my left,\ndown in the street where those taxis were parked. There was a commotion\ndown there by the office building entrance. I know now what caused it,\nbut at the time I did not notice. The wing of the castle was under me.\nThis would be the tower. Its upper room, or the balcony, just about\nwhere I was standing. I prayed that it might be so. I seemed with my\nmind to see it all.\n\nI lay down on the floor by the window. Out in the office building\nhallway I heard heavy footsteps come running. One of the night watchmen\nhad evidently heard the glass crashed.\n\nI laughed. I pressed the switch at my wrist....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_The Fight on the Tower Balcony_\n\n\nThe sensations swept me again. The room faded. Whether the watchmen came\nin to see a ghost of me lying there on the floor I did not know, nor did\nI care. I whirled into the shadows. And came in a moment out of the\nblack silence. The office room was gone. I seemed to have fallen or\nfloated down--how far I do not know. A triumph swept me. I was lying on\nanother floor. I could see a doorway materializing. I was not upon the\nbalcony as I had calculated, but within the tower room. New walls sprang\naround me.\n\nI did not heed it, this time, the sensation, of the transition. I was\ntoo alert to what new situation might come upon me. The tower room. I\ncould see it. I could see its oval windows close at hand. The doorway to\nits balcony. Sounds flooded me, mingled with the humming within me.\nFamiliar sounds. The crowd shouting. And a single voice--the voice of\nRohbar. Vague and blurred, but as I materialized it became clearer.\n\nI was suddenly aware that there was a man beside me. One of the palace\nsoldiers. He saw me materialize. He leaped backward in horror. I flung\nmy switch. I was on my feet, swaying, and then I leaped upon him. My\ndirk plunged downward into his chest.\n\nThe thing made me shudder. I reeled with the sickness of it, but as he\nfell I clung to the dirk and ripped it out of him. It was dripping with\nhis blood.\n\nI stood trembling. The small tower room had no other occupants. I turned\ntoward the door. I could see a patch of stars, paling with the coming\ndawn. I crouched in the small doorway which gave onto the balcony,\nstaring, swiftly calculating. The scene had scarcely changed. But, some\nof the soldiers had left the entrance platform, gone, no doubt, into the\ncastle on their way upstairs to seize Derek.\n\nOn this upper balcony, no more than ten feet before me, Rohbar still\nstood gripping Hope. She was in front of him. His back was to me. A\nsudden jump, and I could plunge my dagger into his back.\n\nRohbar was shouting, \"King Leonto is dead. If you should want me to\nsucceed him, I will take this girl Hope for my queen. You all love\nher....\"\n\nI was tense to spring. Then out in the balcony, to one side, I saw\nSensua crouching. Her crimson robe fell away to bare her white limbs.\nHer hand fumbled in her robe. She had been Rohbar's dupe, and now she\nknew it. Her knife was in her hand. Frenzied with jealousy and rage she\nsprang upon Rohbar's back, trying to stab at Hope.\n\nPerhaps he sensed her coming, heard her; or perhaps she was unskilful.\nHer knife only grazed Hope's shoulder. He released Hope. He roared. He\nturned and gripped his murderous assailant. A second or two while I\nstood watching. He caught Sensua's wrist, twisted the knife from it and\nplunged the knife into her breast. She sank with a scream at his feet,\nand as he straightened he saw me.\n\nBut I had leaped. I was upon him. His own knife had remained in Sensua's\nbreast. As I raised mine in my leap, he caught at my wrist; twisted it,\nbut I flung the knife away before he could get it. The knife fell over\nthe balcony rail. The weight of my hurtling body flung him backward, but\nthe rail caught him. His arms went around me. Powerful arms, crushing\nme. I gripped at his throat.\n\nThere was an instant when I thought that we would both topple over the\nrailing. I felt Hope beside us. I heard her scream. We did not go over\nthe rail, for Rohbar lurched and flung us back. We dropped to the\nbalcony floor, rolling, locked together. He was far stronger and\nheavier than I. He came uppermost. He lunged and broke my hold upon his\nthroat, but I was agile: I squirmed from under him. I almost regained my\nfeet. He got up on one knee. He was trying to draw his sword. Then again\nI bore into him, kicking and tearing. He roared like a bull. And\nignoring my plucking fingers, my flailing fists, he lunged to his feet\nwith me gripping again at his throat.\n\nHis huge height swung me off the ground. I was aware that he had drawn\nhis sword, but I was too close for him to use it. He swayed drunkenly\nwith my weight; he was confused. I felt the rail behind us. We lunged\nagain into it. Again I heard Hope scream in terror, and saw her leap at\nus. Rohbar stooped, trying to clutch the low rail. His bending down\nbrought my feet to the balcony floor. With a last despairing effort I\nshoved him backward. And as he toppled at the rail, I fought to break\nhis hold upon me. I felt us going and then I felt Hope reach me. Her\narms flung about my waist. Her hold tore me loose. Rohbar's huge body\nfell away....\n\nFor an instant Rohbar seemed balanced upon the rail; then he went over.\nHe gave a last long, agonized scream as he fell. I did not look down. I\ncrouched by the rail. The crowd in the garden; Derek standing on the\nother balcony; the soldiers who now had appeared behind him--all were\nsilent, and in the silence I heard the horrible thud of Rohbar's body as\nit struck....\n\nI clung to Hope for an instant, and she shuddered against me. The scene\nbroke again into chaos. I cast Hope away and leaped up. I stood at the\nbalcony rail. My arms went up and gestured to Derek. Amazement was on\nhis face, but he answered my gesture. Behind him the soldiers who had\ncome to seize him were standing in a group, stricken at this new\ntragedy.\n\nDerek swung on them. He was not powerless now! \"Away with you!\"\n\nHis cylinder menaced them, and they fell back in terror before him.\n\nHe darted past them and disappeared into the castle.\n\nI felt Hope plucking at me. \"I want to talk to the people.\"\n\nShe stood beside me, leaning over the rail. Gentle little figure.\nFamiliar figure to them all. Their beloved Hope. Her voice rang out\nclearly through the hush.\n\n\"My people, we all want our beloved Alexandre--he has come back to us.\nHe is our rightful king.\"\n\n\"King Alexandre! Long live King Alexandre!\"\n\nDerek in a moment appeared behind us. \"My God, Charlie, I can't\nunderstand--\"\n\nI told him how I had done it. He gripped me. \"I'll never be able to\nrepay you for this!\"\n\nI pushed him forward and he joined Hope at the rail. Held her, and her\narms went around his neck as she returned his kisses. The crowd gaped,\nthen cheered.\n\nI shouted, \"Hope will be your queen--The reign of the crimson nobles is\nat an end!\"\n\nThe wild cheering of the people, in which now the castle guards were\njoining, surged up to mingle with my words.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_One Tumultuous Night_\n\n\nI come now with very little more to record.\n\nI returned to my own world. And Derek stayed in his. Each to his own;\none may rail at this allotted portion--but he does not lightly give it\nup.\n\nThe scientists who have examined the mechanism with which I returned\nvery naturally are skeptical of me. Derek feared a further communication\nbetween his world, and mine. He smiled his quiet smile.\n\n\"Your modern world is very aggressive, Charlie. I would not want to\nchance having my mechanism duplicated--a conquering army coming in\nhere.\"\n\nAnd so he adjusted the apparatus to carry me back and then go dead. I\nhave wires and electrodes to show in support of my narrative. But since\nthey will not operate I cannot blame my hearers for smiling in derision.\n\nYet there is some contributing evidence. Derek Mason has vanished. A\nwatchman in an office building near Battery Park reports that at dawn of\nthat June morning he heard splintering glass. He found the office door\nwith its broken panel, and the ax lying on the hall floor. He even\nthinks he saw a ghost stretched out by the window. But he is laughed at\nfor saying it.\n\nAnd there is still another circumstance. If you will trouble to examine\nthe newspaper files of that time, you will find an occurrence headed\n\"Inexplicable Tragedy at Battery Park.\" You will read that near dawn\nthat morning, the bodies of three men in crimson cloaks came hurtling\ndown through the air and fell in the street near where several taxis\nwere parked. Strange, unidentified men. Of extraordinary aspect. The\nflesh burned, perhaps. All three were dead; the bodies were mangled by\nfalling some considerable height.\n\nAn inexplicable tragedy. Why should anyone believe that they were the\nthree crimson nobles whom Derek attacked with his strange ray?\n\nI am only Charles Wilson, clerk in a Wall Street brokerage office. If\nyou met me, you would find me a very average, prosaic sort of fellow.\nYou would never think that deeds of daring were in my line at all. Yet I\nhave lived this one strange tumultuous night, and I shall always cherish\nthe memory.\n\n\n\n\nThe Stolen Mind\n\nBy M. L. Staley\n\n[Illustration: _The structure, pivoting downward, plunged Quest to his\nwaist in the osmotic solution._]\n\n[Sidenote: What would you do, if, like Quest, you were tricked, and your\nvery Mind and Will stolen from your body?]\n\n\n\"What caused you to answer our advertisement?\" Owen Quest felt the steel\nof the quick gray eyes that jabbed like gimlets across the office table.\n\n\"Why does any man apply for a job?\" he bristled.\n\nKeane Clason gave an impatient smile.\n\n\"Come!\" he said. \"I'm not trying to snare you. But there were unusual\nfeatures to my ad, and they were put there to attract an unusual type of\nman. To judge your qualifications, I must know just why this proposition\nappeals to you.\"\n\n\"I can tell you that,\" nodded Quest, \"but there's nothing unusual about\nit. In the first place, I knew that the Clason Research Corporation is\nthe leading concern of its kind in the country. In the second place,\nthis seemed to offer a way to obtain a substantial sum of money\nquickly.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Clason. \"And you feel that you have all the necessary\nqualifications?\"\n\n\"Decidedly. I am 24 years old, athletic, and of an earnest and\ndetermined nature. Moreover, I have no family ties, and I'm willing to\nrun any reasonable risk in order to improve the condition of my fellow\nmen.\"\n\nClason smiled his approval.\n\n\"You say you need money. How much immediately?\"\n\nQuest was unprepared for the question.\n\n\"A thousand dollars,\" he ventured.\n\nWithout hesitation Clason counted out ten one-hundred-dollar notes from\nhis wallet and laid them on the table.\n\n\"There's your advance fee. You're ready to go to work immediately, I\nhope?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" stammered Quest.\n\nStunned by the swiftness of the transaction, he sat staring at the money\nthat lay untouched before him.\n\nTo accept it would be like signing an unread contract. But he had asked\nfor it; to refuse it was impossible. Even to delay about picking it up\nmight arouse Clason's suspicion. Already the latter had turned away and\nwas opening the door of a steel cabinet. Quest had one second in which\nto reach a decision.... He crammed the currency into his pocket.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith delicate care Clason set two objects on the table. One looked to\nQuest like a miniature broadcasting tower or a mooring mast for lighter\nthan air craft. The other was a circular vat of some black material,\nprobably carbon. Within it a series of concentric tissues were suspended\nfrom metal rings, and in a trough outside ranged four stoppered flasks\ncontaining liquids of as many different colors.\n\n\"Look at these models carefully,\" said Clason. \"They represent two of\nthe most remarkable discoveries of all time. The one on your left is the\nmost _de_structive weapon known to man. The other I consider the most\n_con_structive discovery in the history of science. It may even lead to\nan understanding of the nature of life, and of the future of the spirit\nafter death.\n\n\"Both of these were developed by my brother Philip and me together--but\nwe have disagreed about the use to which they shall be put.\n\n\"Philip\"--the inventor dropped his voice to a whisper--\"wants to sell\nthe secret of the Death Projector--the tower, there--as an instrument of\nwar. If I should permit him to do that, it might lead to the destruction\nof whole nations!\"\n\n\"How?\" demanded Quest \"I've heard of a device called the Death Ray. Is\nthis it?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Clason contemptuously. \"Even in a perfected state the Ray\nwould be a child's toy compared to the Projector. This is based on our\ndiscovery that invisible light rays of a certain wave-length, if highly\nconcentrated, destroy life--and our additional discovery that if these\nare synchronized with short radio waves the effect is absolutely\ndevastating.\n\n\"We obtain the desired concentration of invisible light by using a\ntellurium current-filter under the influence of alternate flashes of red\nand blue light. The projector can literally blanket vast areas with\ndeath, up to a top range of at least five hundred miles.\n\n\"Just picture to yourself what this means! In a space of ten minutes two\nmen can lay down a circle of destruction a thousand miles in diameter;\nor they can cut a swath five hundred miles long in any desired\ndirection.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Have you ever proved it?\" demanded Quest skeptically.\n\n\"Yes, young man, we have,\" snapped Clason. \"Right here in the\nlaboratory--but on a minute scale, of course. However, there's no time\nto demonstrate now. The point is that my brother is determined to sell\nif he can obtain his price for the invention. He argues that instead of\nbringing disaster upon the world, this machine will forever discourage\nwar by making it too terrible for any civilized nation to consider. In\nspite of my opposition he has opened negotiations with an ambitious\nBalkan power. He may actually close the sale at any moment!\n\n\"However,\" Clason drew a deep breath \"you see this other device? Simple\nas it appears, it is the key to the whole situation. We can use it--you\nand I--to overcome Philip's will and prevent this unthinkable\ntransaction. The two of us can do it. Alone I would be virtually\nhelpless.\"\n\n\"Why not have the Projector confiscated or destroyed by our own\nGovernment?\" suggested Quest. \"That seems to me the only safe and sure\nway out of the difficulty.\"\n\n\"You simply do not understand,\" frowned Clason impatiently. \"Philip is\nselling the plans and descriptions of the machine, not the machine\nitself. Even if this model and the larger test machine that we have\nbuilt were destroyed--even if I were willing to have Philip sent to\nLeavenworth for life--he could still sell the Projector.\n\n\"But this other invention, our Osmotic Liberator, makes it possible for\nme to gain control of Philip and actually _change his mind_, through the\nmedium of an agent. I have hired you to act as my Agent, Quest, because\nI can see that you are a young man of unusual character and vitality.\nAnd by way of reward I can promise you both money and a brilliant\nfuture.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inventor poised in a tense attitude on the edge of his chair as\nthough his body were charged with electricity. His eyes seemed to dart\nout emanations that set Quest's blood to tingling. Then for a moment the\nlatter lost consciousness of his physical self. It was as though he had\nopened a door and found himself suddenly on the brink of a new and\ntotally strange world. He dispelled this fancy by a quick effort of the\nwill, for he knew that he had a delicate problem on his hands and that\nit must be solved within a very few minutes. However he proceeded, he\nmust act without disloyalty to his Government, and at the same time\nwithout injustice to Keane Clason.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said in a husky voice, \"how do you intend to use me? I do\nnot believe in Spiritualism. I would be a poor medium.\"\n\nClason gave a short laugh.\n\n\"You are not to be a medium in that sense at all. Spiritualism as\npracticed is just a blind sort of groping and hoping. Osmotic\nLiberation, on the other hand, is an exact and opposite physico-chemical\nscience. Here--I will show you.\"\n\nInto the outer cell of the Liberator he emptied the purple vial, and so\non to the innermost, which he filled with a golden-green liquid like old\nChartreuse.\n\n\"The separating membranes, you understand, are permeable by these\ncomplicated solutions. Each liquid has a different osmotic pressure and\ntherefore should, under normal conditions, interchange with the others\nthrough the membranes until all pressures are equalized. I prevent such\ninterchange, however, by maintaining an anti-electrolysis which retards\nionization and thus builds up what might be called osmotic potential.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now if an Agent--yourself for instance--submerges himself in the\ncentral cell, at the same time maintaining a physical contact with his\nControl at the surface of the liquid, and if then the osmotic potential\nis suddenly released by throwing the electrolytic switch, the host of\nions thus turned loose in the outer compartments make one grand rush for\nthe center solution, which contains the cathode.\n\n\"Under these conditions your body becomes a sort of sixth cell, and your\nskin another membrane in the series. Properly speaking, however, you are\nnot a part of the electrolytic circuit but are merely present in the\naction. Your body acts as a catalyser, hastening the chemical action\nwithout itself being affected in any way. Physically you undergo no\nchange whatever; but in some strange way which is, like life, beyond\nanalysis, your mind flows out into the solution, while your unaltered\nbody remains at the bottom of the tank in a state of suspended\nanimation.\n\n\"If no Control is present, all that is needed to return your mind into\nyour body is a throw of the electrolytic switch back to negative,\nwhereupon you emerge from the tank exactly as you entered it. But with\nyour Control present and in contact with your submerged body, your mind,\ninstead of remaining suspended in the solution, flows instantly into his\nbody and resides there subject to his will.\n\n\"This can not be done, however, unless the wills of Control and Agent\nhave first been brought into accord. To accomplish that, we clasp\nhands\"--Quest grasped Clason's extended hand--\"and look steadily into\neach other's eyes.\n\n\"Now, it is well known that the vibrations of an individual's will are\nas distinctive as the sworls of his finger-prints. What is not so well\nknown is that the frequency of vibration in one person can be brought\ninto accord with that in another.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You consciously retract your will by concentrating your mind upon the\nthing which you know I wish to accomplish. Gradually while we continue\nin this position your vibrations speed up or slow down until they\nacquire exactly the same frequency as my own. We are then in accord, and\nwhen your mind is liberated in the tank it is in a state which admits\nabsorption into my body. And it is subject to my will because you have\npurposely attuned it to my peculiar frequency. Immediately after the\ntransfer there will be a brief conflict, due to the instinctive desire\nof your will to obtain the ascendancy. But of course mine will gain the\nupper hand at once, since both wills will be in my frequency.\"\n\nQuest felt, rather than saw, a wall of alarm closing in on him. He tried\nto avert his eyes, to withdraw his hand from Clason's grasp. With a\nnostalgic pang in the pit of his stomach he suddenly realized that he\ncould not do so. He had gone too far--farther than any man in his\nposition had a right to go. Having deliberately weakened his will, it\nseemed now to have deserted him entirely. A prickling sensation coursed\nup his spine, his extended arm went numb, his hand trembled violently.\n\n\"Splendid!\" said Clason, suddenly releasing both eye and hand. \"Just as\nI foresaw, you will be able to attune yourself to my vibration-frequency\nwith hardly an effort. Now please remain seated; I'll be back in a\nmoment.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a second after the door closed, Quest remained slumped in his chair.\nThen he was on his feet, shaking himself like a wet dog to free himself\nfrom the spell under which he had fallen. Something about Clason\nattracted and at the same time repelled him, fraying his nerves like an\nirritant drug and confusing his mind at the moment when he needed the\nfull alertness of every faculty.\n\nInvisible light--disembodied minds--will vibrations! Nothing there to\nget hold of. Were these things real or imaginary? Was Keane Clason a\ngreat inventor, or a madman? Would Philip prove to be a real or an\nimaginary scoundrel? Should he summon help, or go on alone?\n\nProfessional pride said: wait, don't be an alarmist! With his knuckles\nQuest tapped the table, half expecting it to melt under his fingers. The\nfeeling and sound of the contact gave him a peculiar start. On the\nfarther end of the table stood a letter-box--an invitation. From his\npocket Quest snatched a slip of paper, and wrote:\n\n     6 stroke 4--9:45A--Hired. If no report in 48 hours, clamp down\n     hard.\n\nTo address a stamped envelope and slip it in with the outgoing mail was\nthe work of seconds. But he was none too quick. He had just dropped back\ninto a lounging attitude when the door burst open and Clason flew into\nthe room?\n\n\"We must act instantly,\" hissed the inventor. \"Philip plans to close the\ntransaction within a day.\"\n\nIn spite of himself, Quest jumped upright in his chair. Clason tapped\nhim on the shoulder reassuringly.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he smiled, \"I'm ready for him. We'll make our move\nthis afternoon and beat him by eighteen hours.\n\n\"Let's see.\" He paused. \"Oh! yes. I was about to explain to you that as\nsoon as the will of the Agent enters the body of his Control, the latter\ncan again transfer it into the body of still another person.\n\n\"Now you understand why I advertised for a man of exceptional character?\nAs my Agent, I want you to enter the body of Philip, and your will must\nbe strong enough to conquer his in the battle for mastery which will\nbegin the instant you intrude into his body. You will still be under my\ncontrol, but your will must be strong enough on its own merits to\novercome his. I can direct you, but your strength must be your own.\nThat's clear, isn't it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think so,\" said Quest slowly. \"But what becomes of me after you have\nfrustrated Philip's plot?\"\n\n\"That's the easy part of the process,\" smiled Clason; \"but naturally you\nfeel some anxiety about it. I simply withdraw your will from Philip,\nreturn it to your own body, and pay you a reward of ten thousand\ndollars.\"\n\n\"You're sure you can?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. I have merely to touch Philip's hand to recapture your will.\nThen I immerse myself in the tank with the switch at plus. The osmotic\naction will extract both wills momentarily from my body. But the\npresence of two bodies and two wills in the solution together forces a\nbalance, and each will seeks out and enters its own body. Then you and\nI climb out of the tank exactly as we are this minute.\"\n\n\"If it weren't for my belief that anything is possible,\" Quest shook his\nhead, \"I'd say that your claims for this invention were ridiculous.\"\n\n\"And you couldn't be blamed,\" admitted Clason readily. \"This toy of a\nmodel is hardly convincing. But come along with me and I'll show you how\nthe Liberator looks in actual operation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe office rug concealed a trap door which gave upon a spiral stair.\nBelow, Clason unlocked another door and led the way through a narrow and\ntremendously long passage lighted at intervals by small electric bulbs.\nPresently another door yielded to the inventor's deft touch and closed\nbehind them with a portentous chug. Here the darkness was so utter and\nintense that Quest imagined he could feel the weight of it on his\nshoulders. From the slope of the passageway and the muffled beat of\nmachinery that had come to his ears on the way along, he guessed that he\nwas below ground in some chamber at the rear of the factory.\n\nHe gave a low exclamation as Clason switched on the toplight. No wonder\nthe darkness had seemed of almost supernatural quality! Even the hard\nwhite glare of the daylight arc was grisly. Its rays rebounded from the\nliquids of the great circular tank in a blinding dazzle of color, while\nthe dull black walls and ceiling were so perfectly absorptive that\nbeyond arm's length they became to all effects invisible. Even the ledge\non which he stood--the shoulder of the vat--gave Quest the feeling that\nto move would be to step off into a bottomless pit.\n\nBut Clason took his attention at once, pointing here and there in his\nquick, nervous way to indicate how faithfully the Liberator had been\nreproduced from the model. In all respects the arrangements were the\nsame, with the addition that here a long plank like a spring-board\nextended out from a wall-mount as far as the central compartment of the\ntank, and that from its end a narrow ladder hung down to the surface of\nthe Chartreuse liquid. A double-throw switch fixed to the wall above the\nbase of the plank was evidently the source of electrolytic control.\n\n\"When you throw the switch to plus,\" said Clason, pointing to the\nchalk-marked sign above, \"you produce the violent electrolytic action\nneeded to bring about a liberation. All the rest of the time it should\nbe closed at minus, in order to maintain the anti-action which I\nexplained to you.\n\n\"Now let's rehearse, so that when the time for the real performance\narrives we can be sure of running it off without a hitch.\"\n\n\"All right, sir,\" nodded Quest, so dazed by the glittering light that he\nwas hardly conscious of what he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"First,\" said Clason, running lightly up the steps to the plank, \"you\nwalk out to the end, like this, and start down the ladder. Then you\nlower yourself into the tank. The liquid is at body temperature; it's\nneither strongly acid nor caustic; it will cause you no injury or\ndiscomfort whatever.\n\n\"Meanwhile I keep in contact with your hand until the instant that you\nbecome submerged. Now your mind is in me, see?--ready for transfer into\nPhilip, where it will act as my Agent. That's how simple it is! Come on\nup and we'll go through the motions.\"\n\nQuest experienced a shiver as he mounted the bridge. Annoyed with\nhimself, he shrugged the feeling off. There was no risk here. Moreover,\nit was a part of his daily work to take chances; he had done so a\nhundred times without hesitation. Now he moved all the more quickly, as\nif to belie the squeamishness that possessed him in spite of himself.\n\nSwinging past Clason on the plank, he lowered himself without a pause\nto the bottom rung of the ladder, while the inventor, hanging head\ndown, maintained contact with him.\n\n\"No need to stay here,\" he said in sudden irritation. \"I understand\nperfectly what I am to do.\"\n\n\"I'm testing my own acrobatic ability,\" grunted Clason amiably. \"Just a\nminute now.\"\n\nHe wriggled as if trying to adjust himself to a better balance, but in\nreality to mask the motion of his free hand with which he reached up and\npressed a button in the side of the plank. Instantly the structure,\npivoting downward on its wall-socket, plunged Quest to his waist in the\nosmotic solution.\n\n\"For God's sake get out of the way!\" he shouted, trying to wrench his\nhand out of Clason's sinewy grip. \"Let go, I tell you!\"\n\nBut Clason clung like a leech, his teeth gritted under the strain. Again\nthe plank lurched downward, and with a violent splash Quest vanished\nbelow the surface.\n\nQuick as a cat, Clason scrambled up the ladder and back to the base of\nthe plank, where he erased and interchanged the chalk-marked signs with\nwhich he had misled Quest. Then with a sinister twist of a smile he\nthrew the switch to minus, and turned to watch as the plank slowly\nrighted itself and the vacant ladder came clear of the liquid.\n\nFor some time he stood staring at the gleaming colored rings of his\ndissociation-vat like some witch over her cauldron, his lips working,\nhis hands clasping and unclasping like the tentacles of some sub-sea\nmonster. Then, as if the spell had suddenly broken, he turned on his\nheel and switched off the light. As he hastened down the passageway\ntoward his office, the airlock sucked the door against its jamb with an\nominous whistle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a twinkling, as Quest's shackled spirit writhed in its new housing,\nhe knew that he was in bondage to a scoundrel. Formless and voiceless,\nhe still fought madly for the freedom which the instinct of ten\nthousand generations made necessary to him.\n\nAt the same time he was furious at himself for having been tricked like\nan innocent schoolboy. The plank socket, the button which had tripped\nthe supporting spring, the fake rehearsal, the tuning of his will to\nthat of Clason--step by step the whole cunning scheme unfolded itself to\nhim now.\n\nBut what could be the purpose behind this villainy? Only one answer\nseemed possible. Keane must be the one bent on selling the Death\nProjector, Philip the one who wished to frustrate the fiendish\ntransaction! And Quest of the Secret Service--he was to be the tool to\nforce the sale.\n\nWith the soundless scream of rage Quest's will hurled itself against\nKeane's. The two met like infuriated bulls, and for an instant too brief\nto be pictured as a lapse of time they poised immovable. But two wills\ncan not exist on equal terms in a single body, and in this case the\nvibration of both was that of Clason. Quest had challenged the Master\nWill. He could do no more. It hurled him back, crushed him like foam,\ncompressed him to the proportions of an atom in the background of his\nconsciousness. So brief and unequal was the conflict that in the next\nbreath Clason had all but forgotten the presence of the stolen will\nwithin him. When he was ready to use his Agent, that would be time\nenough to summon him!\n\nDespite this suppression, Quest began to see dimly through strange eyes,\nand to hear vaguely with ears that were not his own. Feelers, tentacles,\nsome intangible kind of conduits carried thought impulses to him from\nthe Master Will. He received these impressions vividly, but those which\nhe gave off in return were so weak, due to the subjection of his will,\nthat Clason was entirely unconscious of any response. Quest was not\nenough of a scientist to be astonished at the ability of a disembodied\nmind to experience sense impressions in the body of another. He was\nonly glad that the darkness and silence were growing less. Very, very\nslowly he was awakening to a new kind of consciousness--the\nconsciousness of another person's Self. He hated and loathed that Self,\nyet it was better than the awful blankness that had gone before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, as light grew brighter and sound more clear and definite, a\nnew element entered--the element of hope. At first it was feeble: its\nonly suggestion was that sometime, somehow, he might escape this prison.\nBut it was like water to a parched plant. It caused his will to expand,\nto extend its feelers, to press up a little more bravely against the\ncrushing pile of the Master Will.\n\nNow another surprise sprang upon him. He was moving! That is, Clason's\nbody was moving in some kind of a conveyance, which was threading its\nway through crowded streets. Stores, buildings, buses, people--Quest\nremembered them all distantly as things he had known thousands of years\nago. The driver turned his head, and his profile seemed vaguely\nfamiliar.\n\nNow a rush of foreign thoughts drowned out his own. They were a sort of\noverflow from the mind of Clason. They thronged along the conduits that\nbound the two wills together, but only Quest was conscious of the\nmovement.\n\nKeane's mind was on his brother Philip: that much was particularly\nclear. And there was something about a telephone call. Yes, Keane had\ntelephoned to the police, disguising his voice, refusing to divulge his\nname. He had said that a man by the name of Philip Clason was in trouble\nand had told them where to find him. Then the police had telephoned the\nfactory, and Keane had pretended astonishment and alarm at the news.\nThat's why he was here now--he was on the way to confer with the police.\nAnd he was chuckling--chuckling because he had fooled Quest and the\npolice, and because now the hundred million dollars was almost in his\ngrasp.\n\nCutting in close, the car turned a corner and drew up before one of a\nrow of loft buildings in a section of the city which Quest failed to\nrecognize. As Clason stepped to the sidewalk, Quest was more painfully\naware than ever of his powerlessness to influence by so much as the\ntwitch of a muscle the behavior of this hostile body in which he had\npermitted himself to be trapped. In his weakness he felt himself\nshrinking, contracting almost to nothingness under the careless pressure\nof the Master Will.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClason glanced casually at his watch, and three men converged toward him\nfrom as many directions. There was nothing to distinguish them from\nanyone else in the street, but along the conduits it came to Quest that\nthey were detectives and that they were there by appointment with Keane\nClason.\n\n\"What floor?\" asked the latter, with an excitement which Quest felt\ninstantly was pure pretense. \"Are you sure they haven't spirited him\naway?\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" replied the leader of the detectives. \"The alley and roof\nare covered. We'll take care of the rest ourselves.\"\n\nOn tiptoe they climbed three long flights of stairs in the half-light.\nClason held back as if in fear. He was a good actor, and Quest felt the\nshrinking and hesitation of his body as he crouched and slunk along in\nthe wake of the detectives, pretending terror at what was about to\nhappen, though he knew--and Quest knew he knew--that there would be no\nresistance up there--that Philip would be found alone exactly as he had\nbeen left by Keane's hired thugs.\n\nOn the top landing Burke, the leader, paused to count the doors from\nfront to rear.\n\n\"This is it,\" he whispered to the bull-necked fellow just behind him.\n\nThe other nodded, and crouched back against the opposite wall while his\ncompanions placed themselves in position to cross-fire into the room the\nmoment the door gave way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuest longed for the power to kick his hypocrite of a master as he still\nheld back, cowering on the stairs, playing his fake to the limit. Then\nthe door flew in with a splintering shriek under the charge of the human\nbattering ram, and across it hurtled the other two detectives in a cloud\nof ancient dust.\n\n\"Here he is!\" someone shouted.\n\n\"Phil! Phil!\" Keane Clason's voice fairly quavered with sham emotion as\nhe ran into the room and threw himself at a man tightly bound to an\nupholstered chair, which in turn was wedged in among other articles of\nstored furniture.\n\nBut Philip was too securely gagged to reply, and as Burke slashed the\nropes from across his chest he dropped forward in a state of collapse.\nStretched on a couch, he soon gave signs of response as a brisk massage\nbegan to restore the circulation to his cramped limbs. Suddenly he sat\nup and thrust his rescuers aside.\n\n\"What time is it?\" he demanded with an air of alarm.\n\n\"One o'clock,\" replied Keane before anyone else could answer, patting\nhis brother affectionately on the shoulder while within him Quest\nwrithed with indignation. \"By Jove! Phil, it's wonderful that we got to\nyou in time. Really, how--you're not injured?\"\n\n\"No,\" grunted Philip, \"just lamed up. I'll be as fit as ever by\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"If you feel equal to it,\" suggested Burke, \"I wish you'd tell me\nbriefly how you arrived here. Do you know the motive behind this affair?\nDid you recognize any of the body-snatchers?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhilip frowned and shook his head.\n\n\"Yesterday noon,\" he said slowly, \"I took the eight-passenger Airline\nExpress to Cleveland on business. There were three other passengers in\nthe cabin--two men and a woman. Right away I got out a correspondence\nfile and was running over some letters. The next thing I knew I was\napproaching the ground in the strangest state of mind I ever\nexperienced. My head was splitting, and everything looked unreal to me.\nSeemed as if I was coming down on some new planet.\"\n\n\"You mean the ship was gliding down to land?\"\n\n\"No, no. I was dangling from a parachute.... By the way, where am I\nnow?\"\n\n\"In a Munson Avenue loft.\"\n\n\"In Chicago?\"\n\nBurke nodded.\n\n\"I guessed as much,\" frowned Philip. \"You see, I came down in a field,\nand then before I could free myself from my trappings I was pounced\non--trussed up and blindfolded--by a gang of men. I knew they had taken\nme a long distance by automobile, but I saw nothing more until they tore\nthe blindfold from my eyes when they left me here.\"\n\n\"And they were all strangers to you?\"\n\n\"Yes--those that I saw.\"\n\n\"Isn't this enough for just now, Burke?\" interrupted Keane, and Quest\nreceived an impression of uneasiness that was not apparent in the\ninventor's tone. \"After a good rest he's sure to recall things that\nescape him now.\"\n\n\"Just one minute,\" nodded the detective, turning back to Philip. \"Can\nyou think of no plausible reason for this attack? Is there no one who\nmight possibly benefit by putting you temporarily out of the way?\"\n\nPhilip gave a frightened start. Then he was on his feet, clutching at\nhis brother's arm.\n\n\"Keane!\" he pleaded, \"Keane! What's happened? I know, I know! It's the\nProjector.\"\n\n\"Water!\" roared Keane, and Quest felt the panic that coursed through him\nas he tried to drown out his brother. \"Somebody bring water! He needs\nit!\"\n\nAt the same time he snatched up Philip's hand in a grip of steel.\nInstantly the latter's wild eyes became calm, the flush passed from his\nrelaxing face, and he slumped down weakly on the couch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn that fleeting moment Quest surged into the body of Philip and\nconfronted his will with a fierce and triumphant ardor. For now his will\nwould have command of a body with which to fight his fiend of a Control.\n\nWith a sensation of contempt he met Philip's resistance and buffeted him\nruthlessly backward, crushed down and compressed his feebly struggling\nwill. And as Philip yielded, Quest felt his own will expanding to\nnormal, taking possession of the borrowed body with hungry greed, and\nflashing from its faded eyes the spark of youth.\n\nBurke stared in amazement at the kaleidoscopic rapidity of the changes\nin the rescued man's expression. Strange lights and shadows continued to\nflit across Philip's face as Quest's invasion of him proceeded, but with\na diminishing frequency which soon assured Keane that his Agent was\ntightening his command.\n\nThe younger of Burke's aides stood fascinated, his mouth agape. The\nother spoke guardedly to his superior:\n\n\"Dope, eh!\"\n\n\"Nah!\" replied Burke, shrugging himself out of his trance. \"Shock.\"\n\nThe actual duration of the conflict in Philip was something less than\nthree seconds. It would have been more brief if Quest had exerted\nhimself to the utmost. But his sensations as he first surged into this\nnew habitat under Keane's propulsion were so weird and unearthly that\nfor the moment he was lost in the wonder of the experience. For that\nshort time, therefore, Philip was able to fight back against the onrush\nof the invading will.\n\nIn the next second Quest became conscious of the resistance. Urged on by\nhis Control, he must push Philip back and quell him; but his sympathy\nfor his opponent and his hatred of Keane roused him to sudden revolt. He\nwanted to disobey the Master Will, retreat, leave Philip in command of\nhimself. But he could only go on, unwillingly thrusting back Philip's\nwill despite the indescribable torment and confusion in his own. Then,\nwith the feeling that he was ten times worse than the most inhuman\nghoul, he took full possession of his borrowed body.\n\n\"I'll take him home now,\" said Keane composedly to Burke. \"As you see,\nhe needs a little extra sleep. Meanwhile, if you have any occasion to\ncall me, I will be at the factory.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo the youthful mind of the Agent, used to the lightness of an athletic\nphysique, the body in which it moved down the stairs to the limousine\nseemed strangely heavy and awkward.\n\n\"I'm badly done up, Keane,\" he said with Philip's lips as the car got\nunder way.\n\n\"Bah!\" snorted Keane, \"you've had a scare, that's all. Go to bed when\nyou get home and sleep till nine this evening. At ten a man named Dr.\nNukharin will call for you. He will drive you to a garage, leave the\ncar, and transfer to another one a few blocks away.\n\n\"Out near Marbleton you will find an airplane staked in an open field.\nNukharin is a capable pilot. He will fly back southeast along the\nlakeshore to the meeting place. You should arrive about twelve-thirty.\nThe test is set for one o'clock.\"\n\nQuest listened in a state of abject rage. Lacking the power to resist\nhis Control, he could only boil away in Philip's body like a wild\ncreature hemmed in by bars of steel.\n\n\"Bring with you,\" continued Keane venomously, \"the set of papers that\nyou took from the safe in my office. Hold the other set in readiness to\ndeliver to Nukharin to-morrow, after he has studied the results of the\ntest and has notified Paris to release a hundred million dollars in\ncash for delivery at your Loop office at 3 p. m.\"\n\nThe murderous greed of the man maddened Quest. He tried to revolt, his\nwill squirming like a physical thing, threshing the ether like a wounded\nshark in the sea. For a moment he felt that he was about to burst the\nbonds that his demon of a Control had woven around him. So violently did\nhe resist that the immured and sporelike will of Philip forged up\nfitfully out of the blackness and joined his in the hopeless struggle.\nBut along the attenuated conduits that still chained Quest to the Master\nWill Keane caught the impulse of the mutiny, and his eyes darted flame\nas he countered with a will-shock that paralyzed his unruly Agent.\n\n\"Listen! you whimpering dog,\" he snarled. \"Think as I tell you--and\nnothing more! You are going to apologize to Dr. Nukharin for your\nprevious unwillingness to sell the Projector. You are going to tell him\nthat I am at fault--that I held out--but that you found a way to force\nmy compliance. You understand?\"\n\nQuest could find no words. With Philip's head he nodded meekly. Just\nthen the car stopped and the chauffeur threw open the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Nukharin flew high despite the masses of cumulus cloud which\nfrequently reduced visibility to zero. He had merely to follow the rim\nof the lake to his destination, and an occasional glimpse of the water\nwas sufficient to hold him on his course.\n\nIn the back seat hunched Philip, his body crumbling under the weight of\nQuest's despair. For hours the latter had gone on vaguely, hoping\nsomehow to thwart this horrible transaction that was rushing the world\nto its doom, thinking he might grow strong enough to wrench himself free\nand so liberate Philip from the dominance of his conscienceless brother.\nEven though such a move should leave his own will forever separate from\nhis body, he was ready and anxious to make the sacrifice.\n\nSuddenly the crash of the motor ceased and Nukharin banked the ship up\nin a spiral glide. Quest had never been in the air before, and the long\nwhirl down into the darkness on this devil's errand was to him as eery\nas a ride to perdition in a white-hot projectile.\n\nHis mind seemed to trail out in a great nebular helix behind the\ndescending ship. He felt that he had suddenly crossed some cosmic\nmeridian into a new plane of existence, where he was changed to a gas,\nyet continued capable of thought. But even here his obsession remained\nthe same. Keane Clason--trickster, traitor, arch-criminal--must be\ndestroyed!\n\n\"I'll get him!\" vowed Quest in words that were no less real for being\nsoundless. \"I'll trail him to the end of space and bring him to\naccount!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen wheels touched earth and the cold, bare facts of his destiny rushed\nin on him with redoubled force. He felt the nearness of his Control\nseconds before he perceived him through the eyes of Philip. With a\nsensation like a stab he realized that now he must speak, play his part,\nbe any bloodless hypocrite that Keane Clason chose to make him. The\nsilent order surged down the conduits promptly enough; he responded as\nan automaton obeys the pressure of a button.\n\n\"Well, Doctor,\" chuckled Philip with a cunning leer, \"here's the magic\ntower, just as I promised you. We'll run it up in a jiffy. This test is\ngoing to be so vivid and conclusive that not even a hard-headed skeptic\nlike you can raise a question.\"\n\n\"You misunderstand me,\" returned Nukharin in an injured tone. \"So far as\nI am concerned this procedure is only a formality, but it is none the\nless necessary. Suppose that I should spend a hundred million of my\ngovernment's money and the purchase prove worthless? You may guess that\nmy folly would cost me dear.\"\n\nKeane Clason was waiting on the platform of a giant truck, the motor of\nwhich was idling. All the apparatus was in readiness except that the\nthree demountable sections of the tower had yet to be run up into\nposition.\n\n\"One of the beauties of the D. P.,\" said Philip gleefully to the Doctor,\nwhile Keane smiled slyly to himself, \"is that this pint-size dynamo\nprovides all the current needed for the test. We pick the power for our\nradio right out of the air by means of a wave trap and mensurator\ninvented by this bright little brother of mine,\" and he clapped Keane\npatronizingly on the back.\n\n\"Yes, ah--Dr. Nukharin,\" ventured Keane timidly, and at that moment\nQuest experienced the raging red hatred that causes men to murder.\n\"Philip has promised me that you will employ this device only as a\nthreat to hold the ambitions of the larger powers in check.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course!\" replied the Doctor heartily. \"But now let's have\nthe test. Even at night I'm not too fond of these open-air\nperformances.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe height of the tower as they ran the upper sections into place was\nforty feet. When all connections had been inspected, first by Keane,\nthen by Philip, the former led Nukharin aloft.\n\nAs the climax of his plot approached, Keane's excitement bordered on a\ncataleptic state, hints of which came confusedly through the conduits to\nQuest. With a peculiar satisfaction he felt that Keane was suffering.\nThe inventor's jaws became rigid, as though his blood had changed to\nliquid air and frozen him, and he had difficulty in controlling the\nmovements of his arms.\n\nNow he was afraid! Genuinely afraid, this time. Quest caught the impulse\ntoo clearly to doubt its meaning. This was no sham! Keane was doubting\nhis own machine, fearing that in the crisis some element in the finely\ncalculated mechanism might fail to operate, thus cheating him of the\nblood-money on which his heart was set. Then he was speaking, and even\nNukharin noticed the tremor in his voice:\n\n\"These nine tubes, which look like a row of gun barrels, are molded from\nsilicon paste. Each shoots a beam of invisible light and a radio dart of\nprecisely the same wave length. The destructive effect depends chiefly\nupon this exactness of synchronization.\"\n\n\"A question occurs to me,\" said the Doctor: \"will others be able to\nmanipulate the machine as successfully as you can?\"\n\n\"It's fool-proof,\" chattered Keane, almost losing control of his voice,\n\"absolutely fool-proof. Surely you have scientists in your country who\ncan follow written directions! Nothing more is necessary.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" shrugged Nukharin. \"I only want to be sure that no\nunforeseen difficulties may arise in an emergency.\"\n\n\"See this range-setter?\" continued Keane. \"The thread on the vertical\nshaft enables us not only to limit the range by angling the beams into\nthe ground, but it can also be disengaged and the Projector revolved in\na flat circle for maximum ranges.\"\n\n\"And is there no danger of the machine going wrong--of destroying itself\nand us?\" suggested Nukharin.\n\n\"None whatever, Doctor. There is no explosive force and no great\nelectrical voltage involved. As long as we stand back of the muzzles we\nhave nothing to fear.\n\n\"Now look. I have set the micrometer at three hundred yards, which will\njust about cover the stretch between ourselves and the lake. I will cut\na swath for you--and every bush, every blade of grass, every insect in\nthis swath will be withered to ash in the twinkling of an eye. The\ndestruction will be absolute.\"\n\n\"Please proceed,\" said Nukharin grimly.\n\nKeane pulled a lever in its slot, then pressed it down into its lock as\nhis projection battery swung lakeward at the desired angle. Then with\none hand poised on another lever, he pressed an electric button.\n\nAt the controls below, a bulb flashed on and off. The signal was\nsuperfluous, for already Quest had received his silent command from the\nMaster Will. An icy dread fastened on him. He must obey the unspoken\ncommand; he had no will of his own with which to resist. The test would\nbe a success; the Projector would be sold; the world would be turned\ninto a shambles. And he, Owen Quest, would be the destroyer, the\nmurderer, the weak fool who made this horror possible.\n\nAll this flashed through the Agent's mind in the fraction of a second\nthat it took him to extend Philip's hand, close the switch of the\ndynamo, and snap on the alternating lights in the housing over the\ntellurium filter.\n\nFor an interminable five seconds he waited, in a ferment of revolt which\nthe paralysis of his will made it impossible to put into action. Then\nagain the command pulsed within him, the signal bulb flashed, and he\nreversed his motions of the moment before.\n\nCold sweat cascaded down Philip's face as Quest felt the ladder\nvibrating under descending feet. He longed for the power to hurl Keane\nClason to the ground and turn the Projector upon him. But with an awful\nirony the Master Will forced him to his feet, and to speak in a tone\nthat withered the manhood within him.\n\n\"Come,\" said Philip in a triumphant tone to Nukharin, \"and I will show\nyou that Clason inventions perform as well as they sound.\"\n\nFlashlight in hand, he started toward the lake with Nukharin and his\nbrother close behind him. Twenty paces, and the long meadow grass\nsuddenly vanished from beneath their feet.\n\n\"See that!\" whispered Philip excitedly, waving the light from side to\nside to show the forty-foot swath that stretched away before them. \"Not\na trace of life left, not a blade of grass--nothing but dust!\"\n\nThe only response was a gurgling sound that issued from Nukharin's\nthroat.\n\n\"Look!\" Quest formed the word with Philip's lips under the urge of the\nMaster Will. \"Here was a tall bush. What do you see now? Just a\nteaspoonful of ash. When you examine the remains by daylight, you will\nfind that even the root has disintegrated to a depth of two feet.\"\n\n\"Enough of this,\" croaked Nukharin in horror. \"The deal is closed.\"\n\nHis face was convulsed with fear. Without another word he whirled about\nand fled toward his airplane. Philip gave a start as if to follow.\n\n\"Halt! you slob,\" growled Keane, whose composure had returned with the\nsuccessful outcome of the test. \"I have use for your company, even\nthough you are as great a coward as our Slavic friend.\"\n\nCoward! The epithet stung Quest like a flaming goad. One of the fine,\nintangible lines that bound him under the will of Keane Clason severed,\nand his own will exploded into action like a thunderbolt. With startling\nagility he whirled Philip about, the flashlight clubbed in his hand. But\nKeane was quicker still. A clip on the wrist sent the weapon flying.\nThen Philip reeled backward from a kick in the stomach, and his\nclutching hands beat the air as he sank unconscious in the dust.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a violent tug, Quest lifted Philip's body to a sitting posture. The\nphone was ringing, and by the pull on the will-fibers he knew that Keane\nwas at the other end of the wire. Philip's body was failing under the\nstrain of the part it was forced to play, and the blow of the night\nbefore had further weakened it. Now he sat rocking his head painfully\nbetween his hands. But Quest lifted him to his feet by sheer will, and\nhe staggered across the room.\n\n\"Hello!\", he said in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"Get the hell out here to the factory!\" rasped Keane, and the crash of\nthe receiver emphasized the command.\n\nIt was one o'clock as Philip whirled his sedan into Olmstead Avenue. At\nthree, reflected Quest as the car scorched over the pavements, he must\nbe at the downtown office to deliver the papers and receive the money.\n\nThen he was face to face with Keane, reeling dizzily at the hatred that\nblazed from the latter's accusing eyes.\n\n\"Double-crossed me, eh!\" The voice was a low snarl, and as he spoke\nKeane thumped the extra outspread on his desk. \"But you're not going to\nget away with it--neither of you!\"\n\nDismay, hope, dread, wonder robbed Quest of the power to speak. But he\nwhirled around behind the desk with such unexpected violence that Keane\nstaggered back in alarm. Then he was devouring the screaming headlines\nof the newspaper. Three seconds, like a slow exposure, and every word of\nthe Record's great scoop was etched upon his mind as if with caustic:\n\n     DOOM LAUNCH ADRIFT ON LAKE\n\n     Physician Baffled by Condition of Five Bodies Found in Craft\n\n     Blighted Area on Shore Said to Have Bearing on Tragedy\n\n     THAW HARBOR, IND., June 6.--Five Chicago sportsmen, most of them\n     prominent in business and society, perished in the early hours this\n     morning while returning in the launch of A. Gaston Andrews from a\n     weekend camping party near Hook Spit on the Michigan shore.\n\n     The boat was towed into this port at daybreak by the Interlake Tug\n     Mordecai after being found adrift less than a mile off shore.\n     According to Captain Goff of the Mordecai the death craft carried\n     no lights and he barely avoided running her down. The weather along\n     the Indiana shore was perfect throughout the night and there is\n     nothing to indicate that the launch was in trouble at any time. The\n     bodies are unmarked, and this little community is agog with rumors\n     ranging all the way from murder and suicide to the supernatural.\n\n     Dr. J. M. Addis of Thaw Harbor, the first physician to examine the\n     bodies, says that they appear to have suffered some violent\n     electro-chemical action the nature of which cannot be determined at\n     the moment. This statement is considered significant in view of the\n     reported discovery ashore of a large blighted area almost directly\n     opposite the point where the launch was found. Joseph Sleichert, a\n     farmer who lives in that vicinity, reports that this patch of\n     ground extending back from the lakeshore was completely stripped of\n     vegetation overnight. He ascribes the damage to some unknown insect\n     pest. Others say that the condition of the ground indicates that it\n     has been burned at incinerator temperatures. Nothing is left of the\n     soil but a blue powder.\n\nPhilip faced his brother with eyes that were dull with agony.\n\n\"You have made me a murderer!\" Quest forced out the words in painful\ngasps.\n\nBut Keane snapped back at him like a rabid dog.\n\n\"You did it--you did it yourself! You tampered with the Projector. You\ntried to spoil the test. You changed the range. You tried to kill me,\nand instead you killed these others. And you're going to pay--both of\nyou. You hear me?--you're going to pay!\"\n\nHis voice mounted the scale to a scream. It was a wail of unreasoning\nterror, of the dread of exposure, of the fear that he would fail to\ncollect the fortune now so nearly in his grasp. The accident that had\njarred his well-laid plans had unnerved him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrantically Quest strove to answer him, to explain his utter subjection,\nas Agent, to say that if he had possessed the will to oppose or trick\nhim he would have turned him over to the police, or might even have\nkilled him, at the very outset. But in his frenzy, Keane had so\ntightened his control that Quest was speechless. Now he tried to\nsubstitute gesture for words, but Philip was rooted to the spot like a\nstatue; even his hands were immovable.\n\nHe might have remained in this state indefinitely had not Keane's fears\nwithdrawn his mind from his immediate surroundings. Momentarily he\nforgot Quest, Philip--everything but himself and his predicament. And in\nthe instant that his vigilance relaxed, Quest's enslaved will\nexperienced a sudden lease of strength and hope. Independently of his\nControl, he found that he could move Philip's hand, could take a\nfaltering step.\n\nBut now, what to do? How might he fan this feeble spark of volition to\nsufficient strength for decisive resistance? The idea came to him: if\nonly he could place distance between himself and Keane, perhaps with one\ntitanic effort he might launch himself against the Master Will, take him\nby surprise, crush him down, and reverse him to the status of Agent\ninstead of Control.\n\nWith infinite effort Quest forced Philip's body step by step across the\nroom. He must reach that window, get a signal of distress to someone in\nthe street.\n\nBut Keane began to sense a mutiny. He followed. He crossed the floor\nwith slinking, tigerish steps and snaking body. His wet lips writhed\nback over his teeth, and his contorted features wove the leer of the\nabyss. Now as his Control drew physically near, Quest felt his mite of\nstrength ebbing fast. Slowly Keane reached up with his clawed fingers\nand grasped his Agent by the arm.\n\n\"Remember!\" he hissed, \"if these deaths are traced to us, you break\ndown--you confess--you take the blame--you paint me lily white--you\ndescribe the cowardly means by which you moulded me to your will--you\nplead only for a quick trial and the full penalty of the law. You\nunderstand?\"\n\nQuest made no reply, but he understood all too well the hideous\nintention of his betrayer. What a fool he had been to imagine that Keane\nClason would ever restore him to his body! Philip to the chair, Quest a\nhomeless spirit wandering in space, and for the body at the bottom of\nthe tank, the brief regrets of the Department!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sudden rushing sound filled the air with a sense of action and alarm.\n\nTwo--three--four speeding automobiles swung in recklessly to the curb\nand shrieked to a standstill under smoking brakes. Men leaped out and\ndeployed on the run to surround the factory. Keane darted to the door\nand twisted the key.\n\n\"Come on!\" he spat at Philip as he snatched back the rug and threw open\nthe trap door.\n\nThe command galvanized Quest to action. In two bounds he had Philip on\nthe stairs. A heavy impact rattled the office door just as he dropped\nthe trap into place over his head. Then, infected with Keane's panic, he\nwas running down the passageway like mad.\n\nInside the tank chamber the brilliantly colored rings of liquid flashed\nback the rays of the arclight. Half crazed with anxiety, Keane danced on\nthe black ledge like a monkey on a griddle. His face was ashen, drool\nran from his twisted mouth, his eyes were two black pools of terror.\n\nAgain Quest experienced the peculiar sensation which came with the\nslackening of control. New hope sprang up in his agonized being as heavy\nblows boomed against the air-locked door. Great waves of fear poured\nalong the conduits, betraying to the Agent the state of mind of his\nControl. Now what would Keane do? What could he do? Why, of all places,\nhad he fled down into this blind burrow?\n\nThud, thud! Then came a series of sharp reports. Outside, they were\ntrying to shoot away the deep-sunk disk hinges.\n\nStill the door stood fast, but the fury of the assault on it whipped the\nfaltering Keane to action. In a bound he was on the platform. With a\nlightning hand he threw the switch to plus, starting electrolytic action\nin the tank. Then he pressed a button concealed under the edge of the\nswitch-mount and a panel slid silently aside in the wall, revealing a\nnarrow outlet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Quest everything went a flaming red. He might have known that this\nfox would have something in reserve--a way of escape when danger\nthreatened!\n\nBut his Control gave him no time for independent thought. He forced\nQuest to turn Philip's eyes up to his own. Without disconnecting that\ngrip of his glittering eyes, Keane leaped back to the ledge. Quest felt\nthe silent order:\n\n\"Get up on that plank! Dive into the tank! Get back into your own body,\nlet Philip have his! Then come up--the two of you--and face the music.\nFor I'll be gone, and your story will sound like the ravings of a\nmaniac.\"\n\nQuest took an obedient step toward the platform. But at the same instant\na tremendous crash shivered the door. It seemed to unnerve Keane Clason.\nWith a gasp he sank down upon the steps, his body doubled in pain, his\nhand clutching at his heart. Another crash followed, and he shuddered\nand cried out.\n\nInstantly Quest felt an expansion of the will. Keane's sudden physical\nweakness had loosened his control. Philip's lips worked painfully as\nQuest forced him to pause, to disobey the command of the Master Will. In\na spasm of will he fought to wrench himself free from the countless\nclinging tentacles of his Control. In great surges, Quest's reviving\nvolition pounded against the walls of his borrowed body. Now he sought\nto force this sluggish body back to the wall, so that he might release\nthe airlock and spring the door. But Philip seemed to ossify, every cord\nand muscle of his body frozen to stone by the conflict that raged within\nhim.\n\nBraced against the wall, Keane was rising slowly to his feet. His\nseizure was easing, and so he was able to exert a better pressure upon\nhis rebellious Agent.\n\n\"Come!\" he gasped, realizing that he lacked the strength to escape alone\nand must therefore change his plan. \"Lift me--quick! Carry me out! Slide\nthe panel back into place. We will escape together!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spoken command turned the balance against Quest. His will yielded to\nthe master. At the same instant Philip's body relaxed like an object\nrelieved of a great excess of electrical potential. Suddenly strong and\nsupple, he lifted the trembling Keane and tossed him across his\nshoulder.\n\nFor a moment there had been a lull in the assault on the door. Now the\nbattering resumed with a fury that jarred the whole chamber and sent\nripples dancing across the varicolored liquids in the osmotic tank.\n\n\"Quick!\" gasped Keane. \"Move! I say. Carry me out.\"\n\nBut he was in a fainting condition. Crash after crash rocked the\nchamber, and with every blow Quest's will felt a stimulation that\nenabled him to stand off the commands of his Control. Then a wave of\nnausea swept over him and left him reeling. It seemed that Philip's\nblood had turned to boiling oil. A dazzling mist swallowed him up, and\nwith a weird sense of inflation he felt full strength returning to his\nwill.\n\nA booming blow that bulged the door inward acted upon him like a stage\nplayer's cue. He leaped to the platform. The gurgling sound of\nremonstrance rattled from Keane's throat. But Quest paid no heed. Philip\nwas walking the plank--away from the open panel--out over the tank.\n\nRapidly he dropped down the ladder to the bottom rung, snatched Keane's\nwrist in a gorillalike grip, and hurled him down into the vat.\n\nThen Philip was clinging desperately to the ladder, his strength gone,\nhis body shivering as if with ague.\n\n\"Go on up!\" came a strange, impatient voice from below him. \"For\nheaven's sake let me out of here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA downward glance, and with a shout of alarm Philip was scrambling up\nthe ladder, for there was a head down there, and a pair of naked\nshoulders, and the face of a man he had never seen before. Hand over\nhand Quest followed. Philip had collapsed and lay prone on the plank.\nQuest lifted him to his feet and shook him anxiously.\n\n\"Philip!\" he urged. \"Philip! Can you walk?\"\n\nThe tattoo on the battered door helped to revive the older man.\n\n\"Quick!\" whispered Quest, kneading Philip's arms. \"There's barely an\nhour left. Get to your office. Burn the papers. Refuse the money. Do you\nhear me?\"\n\nPhilip nodded dazedly.\n\n\"Hurry!\" puffed Quest, thrusting him through the opening that Keane had\nreserved for his own escape, and sliding the panel back into place.\n\nQuest was himself now--young, strong, free. Instantly he threw the\nelectrolytic switch to minus. For Keane had failed to emerge from the\ntank, and since he was submerged alone, he could not escape until\nelectrolysis was halted.\n\nJust as Quest leaped from the platform to release the airlock, the door\nburst in and three men with drawn guns rushed into the chamber.\n\nThe leader stopped with a startled oath and stood blinking his\nunbelieving eyes. Quest was poised like a statue, his naked body\ngleaming an unearthly white against the lusterless black of the wall.\n\n\"Quest,\" came from the three in chorus. Then a rush of questions:\n\"What's the matter? What's happened to you? Where are the Clasons?\"\n\nQuest turned toward the platform, expecting to see Keane.\n\n\"Something's wrong!\" he shouted. \"Quick! Somebody get Philip. He's gone\nto his Loop office. Keane Clason's at the bottom of this tank. I'm not\nsure how this thing works, but Philip can get him out! I'm sure of it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDespite the confident predictions of both Quest and Philip Clason,\nosmotic association failed to restore Keane to life, and at last the\ncoroner ordered the removal of the body. The autopsy revealed heart\ndisease as the cause of his death.\n\nFor reasons best understood at Washington, the cause of the five launch\ndeaths was withheld from the public. Quest's punishment for his part in\nthe crime consisted of a promotion and a warm personal letter from the\nPresident of the United States.\n\n\n\n\nCompensation\n\nBy C. V. Tench\n\n[Illustration: _Good God! Was I going mad? Surely this was some awful\nnightmare!_]\n\n[Sidenote: Professor Wroxton had disappeared--but in the bottom of the\nmysterious crystal cage lay the diamond from his ring.]\n\n\n\"Why, John!\" Involuntarily I halted at the entrance to my snug bachelor\nquarters as the flood of light my turning of the switch produced\nrevealed a huddled figure slumped in an easy chair.\n\n\"Aye, sir, 'tis me.\" The man got to his feet, gnarled hands rubbing at\nhis eyes. \"An' 'tis all day that I've been waiting for you, sir. The\ncaretaker said you'd be back soon so let me in. I must have fell asleep,\nan' no wonder, what with the strain an' no sleep or rest all last\nnight.\"\n\n\"Strain? No rest?\" I stared my bewilderment, trying at the same time to\nconceal the vague apprehensions occasioned by the fact that the trusted\nservitor of my friend, Professor Wroxton, should wait all day for me.\n\nHastily shedding my outer things, I bade him again be seated, sat down\nfacing him, and asked him to explain.\n\n\"'Tis the professor, sir.\" The old chap peered at me with anxious,\nwrinkled eyes. \"'Tis common enough for him to send me here on messages,\nsir, but to-day I've come on my own, because, sir,\" answering the\nquestion in my eyes, \"I haven't seen sight of him since last night.\"\n\n\"Why--\" I began.\n\n\"That's just it, sir.\" John took the words out of my mouth. \"For twenty\nyears my wife an' me have looked after the professor at The Grange. In\nall that time he's never been away at night. Whenever he had to come to\ntown he'd tell us. Most times I'd drive him myself in the old car. But\nthat was very seldom, sir, for Professor Wroxton had few interests\noutside.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But, John,\" I protested \"is there no other reason for your agitation?\nHe might have had an urgent call, or gone out for a walk or drive by\nhimself.\"\n\n\"No, sir. If you'll pardon me, sir, you're wrong. The professor was\nfixed in his habits. He would not go away without tellin' me. Think\nback, sir, you know the professor as well as me. Better, because you are\nhis friend and I am only a servant. Although, sir,\" this proudly, \"he\nalways treated me as a friend.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" I urged, seeing he was not finished.\n\n\"Well, sir, a few minutes back you asked me if there was no other reason\nfor my being upset like. There is, sir. You know, sir, that for more'n\ntwenty years the professor has led a retired sort of life; the life of\na--a--\"\n\n\"Recluse,\" I suggested.\n\n\"That's it, sir. He only left The Grange when he had to. He was all\nwrapped up in some weird-like thing he was inventing. In all those\nyears, sir, you were the only visitor who ever went into his laboratory,\nor stayed at The Grange for a night or more. That is, sir, until three\ndays ago.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" I again urged, some of his perturbation communicating itself to\nme.\n\n\"The Grange, sir, lying as it does, fifteen miles from town an' back in\nits own grounds away from the road, isn't noted by many. When strangers\ndo get into the grounds I usually gets 'em out again in short order.\nThree days ago, sir, a stranger drove up to the door in a fine car. He\ntold me he was wantin' to purchase a country home. I told him The Grange\nwas not for sale an' turned 'im away. He was turning his car to leave\nwhen my master came out. To my surprise, sir, he invited the stranger\nin. An' I'm sure, sir, because he looked so taken aback like, that the\nstranger had never seen the professor before.\"\n\n\"And after that?\" I asked, now feeling decidedly uneasy.\n\n\"The stranger, sir--a Mr. Lathom he called himself--stayed on. He was in\nthe study with the master last night. This morning there was no trace of\neither of them.\"\n\n\"But--good God, John!\" I jerked to my feet, a fresh dread clutching at\nmy heart. \"What are you trying to get at? The professor and Mr. Lathom\nmight possibly have driven away somewhere last night.\"\n\n\"Both cars, sir,\" the servant answered, \"are in the garage. I bolt all\nthe doors in the house myself every night. They were still fastened this\nmorning. My wife an' me searched the house from cellar to garret an'\nhunted all over the grounds. We couldn't find a trace of the master or\nhis guest.\"\n\n\"You mean to suggest then,\" I shot at him, \"that two full grown men have\ncompletely vanished? It's absurd, John, absurd!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI paced the floor thinking desperately for a few minutes, conscious of\nthe ancient's anxious eyes. I half smiled. The thing was too ridiculous\nfor anything. Old John had grown morbid from living away from the outer\nworld. Also, I had to admit that the atmosphere of The Grange,\nimpregnated as it was with the lethal scientific dabblings of my friend,\nwas exactly suited to the conjuring up of unhealthy forebodings in\nuneducated minds. I'd drive out to the home of my friend at once. No\ndoubt I'd find him fit and well. He had refused to install a phone, so\ndrive it had to be.\n\n\"John.\" I stopped my pacing and patted him on the shoulder. \"I'm coming\nout to The Grange at once.\" His face showed his thankfulness. \"I am\nsure,\" I went on as I struggled into my coat, \"that we shall find the\nprofessor and his guest awaiting us. Anyway, it's time you got back to\nyour wife and had some food.\"\n\n\"I hope to Heaven, sir, that you're right.\" With that we left the\nbuilding and entered my car.\n\nAlthough I had tried to dispel my fears, although I had tried to banter\nJohn out of his dread, I drove that evening as I had never driven before\nor since. Barely fifteen minutes later I halted my roadster at the short\nflight of steps leading to the main door of The Grange. Even as we\nstepped from the machine the door flung open and an agitated woman\nhurried towards us. She was Mary, John's wife.\n\n\"Sir!\" She gripped my arm and stared anxiously into my face. \"'Tis glad\nI am that you've come. The Grange is a house of death.\"\n\nIn spite of myself a chill shook my whole body. Gently handing her to\nJohn, I strode up the steps.\n\nAt the open doorway I halted, the aged couple crowding on my heels, the\nwoman still babbling about death. I couldn't blame her. All day she had\nbeen alone in that gloomy, rambling old building, wondering, no doubt,\nwhy John and I had not returned sooner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd gloomy the house was. Always, even when staying there at the\nprofessor's request, I had found it to be somber and depressing, as if\nthere lurked within its walls the shadowy wings of the years-old tragedy\nthat had caused my friend to retire to such a God-forsaken place, and\nthere become absorbed in his scientific experiments.\n\nEven now, as I gazed into the dimly-lighted hallway, the air seemed\ncharged with that same malignant something I cannot describe.\n\nPulling myself together I strode quickly along the corridor, and flung\nopen the study door. The lights being full on, one glance sufficed to\nshow me that my friend was not there. Swinging on my heel, the horror I\nsaw in the eyes of the servants, honest, healthy folks not easily\nfrightened, conveyed itself to me. Somehow, the sight of that room,\nlights on, chairs drawn up to the burnt-out fire, brought home to me the\nfact that something serious was amiss. I chided myself for thinking John\nhad been unduly agitated.\n\nFor a moment I stood, trying to conceal the chill coursing through my\nveins, puzzling what to do next. I decided to search the house\nthoroughly. If I found no sign of the professor or his guest, I would\ncall in the police.\n\nFearfully yet willingly the aged couple led me from room to room, from\nattic to basement, until but one place remained--the laboratory. I\nhesitated for several seconds at the closed door of my friend's\nworkroom. Not that I had never entered the--to a layman's\neyes--weirdly-appointed place. I had been in many times with the\nprofessor. But this time I dreaded what I might find.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPulling myself together, I gently tried the door. To my horror it\nyielded to my touch. Alive, the professor always kept it locked. A new\ndread assailed me, as, flinging the door wide open, I blinked in the\nsudden glare of powerful globes. Someone had left the lights full on!\n\nHorrified I stood and stared, knowing by their heavy breathing that the\naged couple were also staring with fright-widened eyes. Afraid of what?\nI did not know. I only knew that the atmosphere had become even more\nsinister. I knew that something dreadful had taken place in that room.\n\nTrembling with consternation I forced myself to take a few steps\nforward, then I again stared about me. At one end of the large room\nsomething shone brightly in the glow of the lights. Slowly I walked\nacross to examine it: it appeared to be a glass case, almost like a\nshow-case, about eight feet square and seven feet in height. With the\nmechanical actions of the mentally distraught I walked all around it.\nNot the slightest sign of an entrance could I see. The fact intrigued\nme. I tapped lightly on the highly polished surface with my fingers. It\nrang to my touch like cut glass.\n\nThrough the transparent surface I could see John and his wife. They were\nwatching me furtively, wondering, no doubt, why I lingered. As I looked\nat them John suddenly lumbered up to the case on the opposite side.\nDropping to his knees, he stared. Turning an imploring gaze to me, he\npointed. His lips moved soundlessly. I followed the pointing finger with\nmy eyes; gasped at what I saw.\n\nNear the center of the cage, on the floor constructed of the same\ncrystalline substance, something glittered, its brilliance almost\ndazzling as the light rays struck it. My face pressed close to the cold\nouter surface of the structure, my shocked intelligence gradually\nrealized what that small sparkling object was. It was a magnificent\ndiamond--and the professor had always worn a diamond ring!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a sudden frenzy of horror I pawed my way around the cage to where\nJohn still knelt. As I reached him he jerked his head in a numb way as\nhe croaked, \"It's a diamond, sir! The professor's!\"\n\n\"But how?\" I implored. \"How can it be? There's no way into this thing.\nPerhaps he was working here, and the stone came loose from its setting.\nHe couldn't have dropped it after the cage was completed.\"\n\n\"It's his diamond, sir,\" intoned the old man, dully. \"I know it is.\"\n\nThen a sudden unreasoning terror filled me. I shrank away from that\nshining box. It seemed to be mocking me, gloatingly, malevolently.\n\n\"Quickly!\" I threw at the aged couple. \"Let us get out of here! Now! At\nonce!\" They needed no second urging. I knew that they felt as I felt:\nthe laboratory was a sepulcher!\n\nFive minutes later I was guiding my car over the narrow road to town. I\ndid not pause until I drew up at police headquarters. I suppose my\nappearance was distraught, for I was ushered into the presence of the\nchief without delay. In a few moments I had poured out my story. He\nlistened with a polite calmness I found almost maddening. Leaning back\nin his chair, he reviewed, audibly, the facts.\n\n\"Some twenty-odd years ago your friend, Professor Wroxton, married. He\nwas so absorbed in the pursuit of some weird invention that he neglected\nhis bride. She ran away with another man. This man deserted her, and\ndisappeared. The professor found her many months later, in desperate\nhealth. Shortly afterwards she died. Your friend tried to trail the man,\nbut failed. Shocked and saddened beyond measure, he retired to a place\nknown as The Grange.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe suddenly straightened up in his seat, and pointed at me a thick\nforefinger.\n\n\"How long have you known Professor Wroxton?\"\n\n\"About ten years,\" I answered.\n\n\"What was he trying to invent?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I replied.\n\n\"And yet you had his confidence in other matters?\"\n\n\"But what has all this to do with finding out what has become of my\nfriend?\" I blurted out. \"Perhaps every moment counts.\"\n\n\"A lot.\" The chief eyed me in a way I did not like. \"Solely because your\nfriend has not been seen by his servants for nearly twenty-four hours,\nmerely because you saw what you believe to be his diamond in some kind\nof a glass compartment in his laboratory, you come here as distraught as\na man who has something terrible on his mind. Why?\"\n\n\"I can't say.\" I shifted uneasily under that direct stare. \"Somehow I\n_feel_ that something dreadful has happened to my friend.\"\n\n\"We do not go by _feelings_.\" The chief got to his feet. \"But you have\ntold me enough to warrant action. I want you to guide me and a couple of\nmen to this house. Please wait here until I return.\" He left the room.\n\nSitting there awaiting his return, I tried to ponder the matter\nreasonably. After all, perhaps the chief was right. Merely because the\nprofessor had been absent for a few hours and I had seen what I thought\nto be his diamond in the laboratory, I had worked myself into a perfect\nfever of anxiety. I almost smiled to myself. In that businesslike office\nthe whole affair did seem absurd. After all the professor did not have\nto answer to his servants for his actions.\n\nHeavy footsteps, announcing the chief's return, caused me to rise to my\nfeet. A few minutes later, in company with the three officers, I was\ndriving again towards The Grange.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe made the return journey in almost complete silence. Occasionally the\nchief would shoot a question at me; but, the night air cooling my\nfevered brain, my replies were guarded. He realized that fact, for I\nfelt his eyes upon me all the way. What was going on behind that broad\nforehead, I wondered.\n\nThen we reached The Grange. As we mounted the steps, John, his wife\nherding behind him, flung wide the door. He answered the question in my\neyes with a negative shake of his head, and the words, \"Nothing fresh,\nsir.\"\n\nThe chief eyed him keenly, then curtly bade him lead the way to the\nlaboratory. John hung back, his face blanched. \"I can't, sir,\" he\nfaltered. The chief turned to me, and, although I wanted to follow\nJohn's example, although the atmosphere of the house had again filled me\nwith an unshakable dread, I led the way, standing back at the door to\nallow the officers to enter first.\n\nWith calculating gaze the chief slowly took in every detail of the stone\napartment. He turned to me.\n\n\"What is there here to be afraid of?\" I pointed hesitatingly towards the\ncrystalline cage. The chief and his men strode across to it.\n\n\"You don't know how to open this?\" the chief shot at me after a brief\nexamination.\n\n\"No,\" I replied. \"It was not here on my last visit.\"\n\n\"When was that?\"\n\n\"Some two or three months ago\", I answered. \"My work occasions much\ntraveling on my part.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chief and his men turned again to the cage, talking in undertones.\nHe turned again to me.\n\n\"You notice that this thing is built in sections. One of them must be\nmovable. Perhaps--\" He paused as his eyes fell upon some wires and tubes\nthat trailed across the floor from underneath the cage to a switchboard\nfastened to the wall.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he repeated, \"it is worked from that board.\" He crossed over,\nstared thoughtfully at the shining levers for some seconds, and moved\none slightly. The result was astounding. All four of us stared with\nunbelieving eyes as slowly, without the faintest sound, a section of one\nwall slid inwards, as if guided by invisible tracks on floor and\nceiling.\n\n\"Guess that's enough for now.\" With the words the chief backed away,\nalmost timidly, I thought, from the switchboard, and walked to the cage.\nFor a moment he hesitated, but he entered, and emerged with the\nsparkling object in his hand.\n\n\"It's the professor's,\" I choked, crowding close to him.\n\n\"How'd you know?\" he shot back. \"All unset stones look pretty much\nalike.\"\n\n\"I just know,\" was all I could falter.\n\n\"You 'just know'.\" The chief sat down on a stool and regarded me\nsearchingly. \"Mr. Thornton, when I started out with you, I thought I was\non a wild goose chase or the trail of a confession. You looked exactly\nlike a man who had either committed a serious crime, or was getting over\na bad drunk. I feel sure now\"--he again regarded the diamond--\"that your\nstory was not the product of an alcohol-crazed brain. Come on!\" He\nlurched to his feet, and grasped me by the shoulder. \"Come through!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout answering, I wrenched myself free. Over my shoulder I saw one of\nthe policemen at the door. In the hand of the other a revolver suddenly\nappeared. Good God! I glared in bewilderment from one to another. Was I\ngoing mad? Surely this was some awful nightmare! What had I said to make\nthem suspect me of having committed a revolting crime?\n\n\"Sit down!\" The command came from the chief. Mechanically I found a\nstool, and obeyed him. \"Hold your stations, boys, and listen carefully,\"\nhe ordered his men. Then he turned to me.\n\n\"Professor Wroxton was a wealthy man without kith or kin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know the nature of his will?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Chilled to the heart, I felt the circumstantial net tightening.\n\n\"What is its nature?\"\n\n\"This house and an annuity to John and his wife,\" I explained. \"The\nresidue of his wealth to me.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" The chief stared at me piercingly. \"And how has business been\nwith you lately?\"\n\nDamn the man! What right had he to put me through the third degree? I\nfelt my state of dazed horror slowly giving way to anger. I glanced\naround. The pistol still menaced; the man at the door had not moved. It\nwas useless to try and evade the questions.\n\n\"For the past year,\" I replied, \"business has been very poor. In fact,\nthe professor advanced me some money.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" Again that irritating, non-committal grunt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chief turned in his seat and stared thoughtfully at the crystalline\ncage.\n\n\"And you don't know what the professor was trying to invent?\"\n\n\"Only its nature,\" I began.\n\n\"Ah! That's better. Why didn't you tell me that before?\" The chief\nleaned forward.\n\n\"Well,\" I explained, \"the whole thing seems so absurd. When the\nprofessor told me how his married life had been broken up, he told me\nthat at that time he reached the utmost depths of human suffering.\nAbsolute zero, he called it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"The experiments he indulged in,\" I continued, trying to hide the shiver\npimpling my flesh, \"were to produce an actual state of absolute zero. It\nis years since he told me this. I had almost forgotten it.\"\n\n\"And exactly what is an absolute zero?\" The chief's eyes never left\nmine.\n\n\"Well,\" I protested, \"please understand that I also am a layman in these\nmatters. According to my friend, an absolute zero has been the dream of\nscientists for ages. Once upon a time it was attained, but the secret\nbecame lost.\"\n\n\"And exactly what is an absolute zero?\"\n\nCurse the man! I could have struck him down for the chilling level of\nhis tone. I forced myself to go on, realizing that I was damning myself\nat every step.\n\n\"An absolute zero is a cold so intense it will destroy flesh, bone and\ntissue. Remove them,\" my voice rose in spite of myself, \"leaving\nabsolutely no trace.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo trace! Something attracted my eyes. The chief had opened his hand.\nThe diamond there flashed and sparkled as if mocking me. I pulled myself\ntogether, and went on.\n\n\"It all comes back to me now. One day I came out here and found the\nprofessor terribly distraught. He told me that, with the aid of electric\ncurrents he had been able to invent the absolute zero, but he could not\ninvent a _container_.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Those eyes continued to bore into mine.\n\n\"Because--remember it is years since he told me this--there was\ndifficulty in controlling the power. Besides destroying living things,\nit would destroy bricks and mortar, stone and iron. Only one substance\nit could not wipe out--crystalline of diamond hardness.\n\n\"I know, now!\" I jumped to my feet and grabbed the chief's arm. \"I know\nnow what he meant. Fool, fool! Why did I not think of it before? This--\"\nI swung towards the cage--\"is compensation.\" Almost panting in my\neagerness I went on:\n\n\"My friend told me that the law of compensation would atone to him for\nthe tragedy of his youth. Absolute zero in suffering would be atoned for\nby a real state of absolute zero. Chief!\" I whirled on him. \"Don't you\nunderstand? This is the perfected dream of my friend. It is the absolute\nzero.\"\n\n\"Humph! Plausible but not convincing.\" I slumped back at the officer's\nwords. \"That does not explain the professor's disappearance. Even if it\ndid, what about Mr. Lathom? And don't forget this contrivance is worked\nfrom outside. We found the diamond inside. Of course, he might have\nplaced it there himself to test the machine,\" he concluded.\n\n\"Of course, that's it,\" I commenced. But I regretted the words when I\nsaw suspicion flicker again in the chief's eyes. Lamely I finished, \"And\nhe has probably rushed off, in an ecstasy of triumph, to acquaint\nprofessional colleagues.\"\n\n\"Without unlocking any doors or taking a car, eh?\n\n\"Mr. Thornton.\" The chief stood up and regarded me sternly. \"As a\nsensible man, don't you think yourself that your story is a bit thin?\nThe professor has disappeared. Here is a strange-looking case which you\nsay is an absolute zero container. Whether you know, or are just jumping\nat conclusions, remains to be proved. But even if it is, do you think\nthat, after perfecting such a tremendous invention, the professor would\ncommit suicide?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I gasped, \"my friend was a man of gentle, kindly\ndisposition, but strong purpose. I should think his first action on\nattaining his life's ambition would be to notify me, his closest\nfriend.\"\n\n\"And he didn't.\" Every word condemned me, and roused me to retaliate.\n\n\"Chief, I know enough of the law to know that, before you can try a man\nfor murder, you must prove that murder has been committed.\" I grinned\nsavagely. \"You must have the corpus delicti. Go ahead! Find my friend or\nhis remains, or else withdraw your charges.\" I grinned again, with\nshocked mirthlessness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen I buried my head in my hands. I had called in the police to help\nfind the professor, and they had only blundered around and asked a lot\nof stupid questions. The chief had practically accused me of\nmurder--something I knew he could not prove, yet feared he might.\nBecause I had told the chief of the locked doors and unused cars, he had\nconfined his investigations to the house itself.\n\nHe interrupted my thoughts.\n\n\"Mr. Thornton, I am going back to town. You will remain here with my\nmen. I advise you to get some sleep, as I shall not be able to carry out\ncertain investigations until the morning. One of my men will spend his\ntime searching the house and patrolling the grounds, the other one will\nstay here with you.\"\n\nHe turned away, whispered some instructions to his men, and, followed by\none of them, silently left the laboratory. I started to protest, tried\nto follow him; the man at the door stopped me. Silently, almost grimly,\nhe indicated a narrow cot at one end of the room. For a moment I\nhesitated, feeling the man's eyes upon me.\n\nSleep on my dead--I felt sure he was dead--friend's cot! Sleep in that\nfearful place! My whole being crawled with horror. I turned again to the\nman. His features were unyielding. Perhaps this was more third degree.\nLimp with weakness and weariness, I dragged my lagging feet towards the\ncot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs long as I live I shall never forget my awakening. A uniformed figure,\nthe chief, shaking me by the shoulder. Two other uniformed men silently\nwatching. I sat up and gazed about me, dazedly. Bright sunlight streamed\nthrough the windows. A stray gleam struck the cage. I shrank back,\ntrembling. And yet I had slept soundly.\n\n\"Mr. Thornton,\" the chief said, \"I have serious news for you. I have\npositive proof your friend is dead.\"\n\n\"Dear God!\" The exclamation was wrung from me as recollection returned\nwith a rush. \"Where? You can't have!\"\n\n\"Here.\" He thrust a bundle of letters into my hands. \"You acted so\nstrangely last night you caused me to suspect you of a serious crime.\nAlso, you overlooked several important points. You got back from a trip\nonly last night.\"\n\nLast night! Surely it was years.\n\n\"You had left instructions to have your mail forwarded,\" the level voice\nwent on. \"These letters were evidently one day behind you. I picked them\nup at your rooms this morning. I took the liberty of opening them. Read\nthis one.\" He selected it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith trembling fingers I extracted from the envelope a single written\npage. I recognized the handwriting as the professor's. I read with\nfeverish intensity, each single word burning itself into my\nconsciousness:\n\n     Dear Thornton:\n\n     I am writing this in anticipation. I will see that it is mailed\n     when my plans are completed. Too late, dear friend, for you to\n     attempt, with the best intentions in the world, to frustrate them.\n\n     You will, perhaps, recall that many years ago, when I gave you my\n     full confidence, I told you that I felt sure that the law of\n     compensation would atone in some measure for my loss. Thornton, old\n     friend, I believe that, in more ways than one, my hour has arrived.\n     Two days ago I completed the absolute zero. But even better!\n\n     A man called here to-day. Although he did not recognize me, I saw\n     through the veneer of added years with ease. Fate, call it what you\n     will, my visitor is the man who wrecked my happiness.\n\n     Under pretext I shall detain him. I shall induce him to enter the\n     crystalline cage. I have already arranged a dual control which the\n     power will destroy when I apply it from _the inside of the cage_.\n\n     Please destroy the cage. It will have brought compensation to me\n     before you read this.\n\n     Good-by, dear friend!\n\n     Wroxton.\n\n\"I apologize, Mr. Thornton.\" The chief offered a hand which I clutched\nin mingled sorrow and relief. The world had lost a genius. I had lost a\ndear friend. But he was right. It was compensation.\n\n\n\n\nTanks\n\n_By Murray Leinster_\n\n    ... The deciding battle of the War of 1932 was the first in which\n    the use of infantry was practically discontinued ...\n\n    --History of the U.S., 1920-1945 (Gregg-Harley).\n\n\n[Illustration: _Row after row of the monsters roared by, going greedily\nwith hungry guns into battle._]\n\n[Sidenote: Two miles of American front had gone dead. And on two lone\ninfantrymen, lost in the menace of the fog-gas and the tanks, depended\nthe outcome of the war of 1932.]\n\n\nThe persistent, oily smell of fog-gas was everywhere, even in the little\npill-box. Outside, all the world was blotted out by the thick gray mist\nthat went rolling slowly across country with the breeze. The noises that\ncame through it were curiously muted--fog-gas mutes all noises\nsomewhat--but somewhere to the right artillery was pounding something\nwith H E shell, and there were those little spitting under-current\nexplosions that told of tanks in action. To the right there was a\ndistant rolling of machine-gun fire. In between was an utter, solemn\nsilence.\n\nSergeant Coffee, disreputable to look at and disrespectful of mien, was\nsprawling over one of the gunners' seats and talking into a field\ntelephone while mud dripped from him. Corporal Wallis, equally muddy and\nstill more disreputable, was painstakingly manufacturing one complete\ncigarette from the pinched-out butts of four others. Both were\nrifle-infantry. Neither had any right or reason to be occupying a\ndefinitely machine-gun-section post. The fact that the machine-gun crew\nwas all dead did not seem to make much difference to sector H.Q. at the\nother end of the telephone wire, judging from the questions that were\nbeing asked.\n\n\"I tell you,\" drawled Sergeant Coffee, \"they're dead.... Yeah, all dead.\nJust as dead as when I told you the firs' time, maybe even deader....\nGas, o'course. I don't know what kind.... Yeh. They got their masks\non.\"\n\nHe waited, looking speculatively at the cigarette Corporal Wallis had in\nmanufacture. It began to look imposing. Corporal Wallis regarded it\naffectionately. Sergeant Coffee put his hand over the mouthpiece, and\nlooked intently at his companion.\n\n\"Gimme a drag o' that, Pete,\" he suggested. \"I'll slip y' some butts in\na minute.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCorporal Wallis nodded, and proceeded to light the cigarette with\ninfinite artistry. He puffed delicately upon it, inhaled it with the\ncare a man learns when he has just so much tobacco and never expects to\nget any more, and reluctantly handed it to Sergeant Coffee.\n\nSergeant Coffee emptied his lungs in a sigh of anticipation. He put the\ncigarette to his lips. It burned brightly as he drew upon it. Its tip\nbecame brighter and brighter until it was white-hot, and the paper\ncrackled as the line of fire crept up the tube.\n\n\"Hey!\" said Corporal Wallis in alarm.\n\nSergeant Coffee waved him aside, and his chest expanded to the fullest\nlimit of his blouse. When his lungs could hold no more he ceased to\ndraw, grandly returned about one-fourth of the cigarette to Corporal\nWallis, and blew out a cloud of smoke in small driblets until he had to\ngasp for breath.\n\n\"When y' ain't got much time,\" said Sergeant Coffee amiably, \"that's a\nquick smoke.\"\n\nCorporal Wallis regarded the ruins of his cigarette with a woeful air.\n\n\"Hell!\" said Corporal Wallis gloomily. But he smoked what was left.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Sergeant Coffee suddenly, into the field telephone, \"I'm\nstill here, an' they're still dead.... Listen, Mr. Officer, I got me a\nblack eye an' numerous contusions. Also my gas-mask is busted. I called\ny'up to do y' a favor. I aim to head for distant parts.... Hell's bells!\nAin't there anybody else in the army--\" He stopped, and resentment died\nout in wide-eyed amazement. \"Yeh.... Yeh.... Yeh.... I gotcha, Loot.\nA'right, I'll see what I c'n do. Yeh.... Wish y'd see my insurance gets\npaid. Yeh.\"\n\nHe hung up, gloomily, and turned to Corporal Wallis.\n\n\"We' got to be heroes,\" he announced bitterly. \"Sit out here in th'\nstinkin' fog an' wait for a tank t' come along an' wipe us out. We' the\nonly listenin' post in two miles of front. That new gas o' theirs wiped\nout all the rest without report.\"\n\nHe surveyed the crumpled figures, which had been the original occupants\nof the pill-box. They wore the same uniform as himself and when he took\nthe gas-mask off of one of them the man's face was strangely peaceful.\n\n\"Hell of a war,\" said Sergeant Coffee bitterly. \"Here our gang gets\nwiped out by a helicopter. I ain't seen sunlight in a week, an' I got\njust four butts left. Lucky I started savin' 'em.\" He rummaged shrewdly.\n\"This guy's got half a sack o' makin's. Say, that was Loot'n't Madison\non the line, then. Transferred from our gang a coupla months back. They\ncut him in the line to listen in on me an' make sure I was who I said I\nwas. He recognized my voice.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCorporal Wallis, after smoking to the last and ultimate puff, pinched\nout his cigarette and put the fragments of a butt back in his pocket.\n\n\"What we got to do?\" he asked, watching as Sergeant Coffee divided the\ntreasure-trove into two scrupulously exact portions.\n\n\"Nothin',\" said Coffee bitterly, \"except find out how this gang got\nwiped out, an' a few little things like that. Half th' front line is in\nth' air, the planes can't see anything, o'course, an' nobody dares cut\nth' fog-gas to look. He didn't say much, but he said for Gawd's sake\nfind out somethin'.\"\n\nCorporal Wallis gloated over one-fourth of a sack of tobacco and stowed\nit away.\n\n\"Th' infantry always gets th' dirty end of the stick,\" he said gloomily.\n\"I'm goin' to roll me a whole one, pre-war, an' smoke it, presently.\"\n\n\"Hell yes,\" said Coffee. He examined his gas-mask from force of habit\nbefore stepping out into the fog once more, then contemptuously threw it\naside. \"Gas-masks, hell! Ain't worth havin'. Come on.\"\n\nCorporal Wallis followed as he emerged from the little round cone of\nthe pill-box.\n\nThe gray mist that was fog-gas hung over everything. There was a\ndefinite breeze blowing, but the mist was so dense that it did not seem\nto move. It was far enough from the fog-flares for the last least trace\nof striation to have vanished. Fifteen miles to the north the fog-flares\nwere placed, ranged by hundreds and by thousands, burning one after\nanother as the fog service set them off, and sending out their\nincredible masses of thick gray vapor in long threads that spread out\nbefore the wind, coalesced, and made a smoke-screen to which the puny\nefforts of the last war--the war that was to make the world safe for\ndemocracy--were as nothing.\n\nHere, fifteen miles down wind from the flares, it was possible to see\nclearly in a circle approximately five feet in diameter. At the edge of\nthat circle outlines began to blur. At ten feet all shapes were the\nfaintest of bulks, the dimmest of outlines. At fifteen feet all was\ninvisible, hidden behind a screen of mist.\n\n\"Cast around,\" said Coffee gloomily. \"Maybe we'll find a shell, or\ntracks of a tank or somethin' that chucked the gas here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was rather ludicrous to go searching for anything in that mass of\nvapor. At three yards distance they could make each other out as dim\noutlines, no more. But it did not even occur to them to deplore the\nmist. The war which had already been christened, by the politicians at\nhome, the last war, was always fought in a mist. Infantry could not\nstand against tanks, tanks could not live under aircraft-directed\nartillery fire--not when forty guns fired salvos for the aircraft to\nspot--and neither artillery nor aircraft could take any advantage of a\nvictory which either, under special conditions, might win. The general\nstaffs of both the United States and the prominent nation--let us say\nthe Yellow Empire--at war with it had come to a single conclusion.\nTanks or infantry were needed for the use of victories. Infantry could\nbe destroyed by tanks. But tanks could be hidden from aerial spotters by\nsmoke-screens.\n\nThe result was fog-gas, which was being used by both sides in the most\nmodern fashion when, their own unit wiped out and themselves wandering\naimlessly in the general direction of the American rear, Sergeant Coffee\nand Corporal Wallis stumbled upon an American pill-box with its small\ngarrison lying dead. For forty miles in one direction and perhaps thirty\nin the other, the vapor lay upon the earth. It was being blown by the\nwind, of course, but it was sufficiently heavier than air to cling to\nthe ground level, and the industries of two nations were straining every\nnerve to supply the demands of their respective armies for its material.\n\nThe fog-bank was nowhere less than a hundred feet thick--a cloud of\nimpalpable particles impenetrable to any eye or any camera, however\nshrewdly filtered. And under that mattress of pale opacity the tanks\ncrawled heavily. They lurched and rumbled upon their deadly errands,\nuncouth and barbarous, listening for each other by a myriad of devices,\nlocked in desperate, short-range conflict when they came upon each\nother, and emitting clouds of deadly vapor, against which gas-masks were\nno protection, when they came upon opposing infantry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe infantrymen, though, were few. Their principal purpose was the\nreporting of the approach or passage of tanks, and trenches were of no\nservice to them. They occupied unarmed little listening-posts with field\ntelephones, small wireless or ground buzzer sets for reporting the enemy\nbefore he overwhelmed them. They held small pill-boxes, fitted with\nanti-tank guns which sometimes--if rarely--managed to get home a shell,\naimed largely by sound, before the tank rolled over gun and gunners\nalike.\n\nAnd now Sergeant Coffee and Corporal Wallis groped about in that\nblinding mist. There had been two systems of listening-posts hidden in\nit, each of admittedly little fighting value, but each one deep and\ncomposed of an infinity of little pin-point posts where two or three men\nwere stationed. The American posts, by their reports, had assured the\ncommand that all enemy tanks were on the other side of a certain\ndefinite line. Their own tanks, receiving recognition signals, passed\nand repassed among them, prowling in quest of invaders. The enemy tanks\ncrawled upon the same grisly patrol on their own side.\n\nBut two miles of the American front had suddenly gone silent. A hundred\ntelephones had ceased to make reports along the line nearest the enemy.\nAs Coffee and Wallis stumbled about the little pill-box, looking for\nsome inkling of the way in which the original occupants of the small\nstrong-point had been wiped out, the second line of observation-posts\nbegan to go dead.\n\nNow one, now another abruptly ceased to communicate. Half a dozen were\nin actual conversation with their sector headquarters, and broke off\nbetween words. The wires remained intact. But in fifteen nerve-racking\nminutes a second hundred posts ceased to make reports and ceased to\nanswer the inquiry-signal. G.H.Q. was demanding explanations in crisp\naccents that told the matter was being taken very seriously indeed. And\nthen, as the officer in command of the second-line sector headquarters\nwas explaining frenziedly that he was doing all any man could do, he\nstopped short between two words and thereafter he, also, ceased to\ncommunicate.\n\nFront-line sector headquarters seemed inexplicably to have escaped\nwhatever fate had overtaken all its posts, but it could only report that\nthey had apparently gone out of existence without warning. American\ntanks, prowling in the area that had gone dead, announced that no enemy\ntanks had been seen. G-81, stumbling on a pill-box no more than ten\nminutes after it had gone silent, offered to investigate. A member of\nher crew, in a gas-mask, stepped out of the port doorway. Immediately\nthereafter G-81's wireless reports stopped coming in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe situation was clearly shown in the huge tank that had been built to\nserve as G.H.Q. That tank was seventy feet long, and lay hidden in the\nmist with a brood of other, smaller tanks clustered near it, from each\nof which a cable ran to the telephones and instruments of the greater\nmonster. Farther off in the fog, of course, were other tanks, hundreds\nof them, fighting machines all, silent and motionless now, but\ninfinitely ready to protect the brain of the army.\n\nThe G.H.Q. maneuver-board showed the battle as no single observer could\never have seen it. A map lay spread out on a monster board, under a\npitiless white light. It was a map of the whole battlefield. Tiny sparks\ncrawled here and there under the map, and there were hundreds of little\npins with different-colored heads to mark the position of this thing and\nthat. The crawling sparks were the reported positions of American tanks,\nmade visible as positions of moving trains had been made visible for\nyears on the electric charts of railroads in dispatcher's offices. Where\nthe tiny bulbs glowed under the map, there a tank crawled under the fog.\nAs the tank moved, the first bulb went out and another flashed into\nlight.\n\nThe general watched broodingly as the crawling sparks moved from this\nplace to that place, as varicolored lights flashed up and vanished, as a\nsteady hand reached down to shift tiny pins and place new ones. The\ngeneral moved rarely, and spoke hardly at all. His whole air was that of\na man absorbed in a game of chess--a game on which the fate of a nation\ndepended.\n\nHe was thus absorbed. The great board, illuminated from above by the\nglaring bulb, and speckled with little white sparks from below by the\ntiny bulbs beneath, showed the situation clearly at every instant. The\ncrawling white sparks were his own tanks, each in its present position.\nFlashing blue sparks noted the last report of enemy tanks. Two staff\nofficers stood behind the general, and each spoke from time to time into\na strapped-on telephone transmitter. They were giving routine orders,\nheading the nearest American patrol-tanks toward the location of the\nlatest reported enemies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe general reached out his hand suddenly and marked off an area with\nhis fingers. They were long fingers, and slender ones: an artist's\nfingers.\n\n\"Our outposts are dead in this space,\" he observed meditatively. The use\nof the word \"outposts\" dated him many years back as a soldier, back to\nthe old days of open warfare, which had only now come about again.\n\"Penetration of two miles--\"\n\n\"Tank, sir,\" said the man of the steady fingers, putting a black pin in\nposition within that area, \"let a man out in a gas-mask to examine a\npill-box. The tank does not report or reply, sir.\"\n\n\"Gas,\" said the general, noting the spot. \"Their new gas, of course. It\nmust go through masks or sag-paste, or both.\"\n\nHe looked up to one of a row of officers seated opposite him, each man\nwith headphones strapped to his ears and a transmitter before his lips,\nand each man with a map-pad on his knees, on which from time to time he\nmade notations and shifted pins absorbedly.\n\n\"Captain Harvey,\" said the general, \"you are sure that dead spot has not\nbeen bombarded with gas-shells?\"\n\n\"Yes, General. There has been no artillery fire heavy enough to put more\nthan a fraction of those posts out of action, and all that fire, sir,\nhas been accounted for elsewhere.\"\n\nThe officer looked up, saw the general's eyes shift, and bent to his map\nagain, on which he was marking areas from which spotting aircraft\nreported flashes as of heavy guns beneath the mist.\n\n\"Their aircraft have not been dropping bombs, positively?\"\n\nA second officer glanced up from his own map.\n\n\"Our planes cover all that space, sir, and have for some time.\"\n\n\"They either have a noiseless tank,\" observed the general meditatively,\n\"or....\"\n\nThe steady fingers placed a red pin at a certain spot.\n\n\"One observation-post, sir, has reopened communication. Two infantrymen,\nseparated from their command, came upon it and found the machine-gun\ncrew dead, with gas-masks adjusted. No tanks or tracks. They are\nidentified, sir, and are now looking for tank tracks or shells.\"\n\nThe general nodded emotionlessly.\n\n\"Let me know immediately.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe fell back to the ceaseless study of the board with its crawling\nsparks and sudden flashes of light. Over at the left, there were four\nwhite sparks crawling toward a spot where a blue flash had showed a\nlittle while since. A red light glowed suddenly where one of the white\nsparks crawled. One of the two officers behind the general spoke\ncrisply. Instantly, it seemed, the other three white sparks changed\ntheir direction of movement. They swung toward the red flash--the point\nwhere a wireless from the tank represented by the first white flash had\nreported, contact with the enemy.\n\n\"Enemy tank destroyed here, sir,\" said the voice above the steady\nfingers.\n\n\"Wiped out three of our observation posts,\" murmured the general, \"His\nside knows it. That's an opportunity. Have those posts reoccupied.\"\n\n\"Orders given, sir,\" said a staff officer from behind. \"No reports as\nyet.\"\n\nThe general's eyes went back to the space two miles wide and two miles\ndeep in which there was only a single observation-post functioning, and\nthat in charge of two strayed infantrymen. The battle in the fog was in\na formative stage, now, and the general himself had to watch the whole,\nbecause it was by small and trivial indications that the enemy's plans\nwould be disclosed. The dead area was no triviality, however. Half a\ndozen tanks were crawling through it, reporting monotonously that no\nsign of the enemy could be found. One of the little sparks representing\nthose tanks abruptly went out.\n\n\"Tank here, sir, no longer reports.\"\n\nThe general watched with lack-luster eyes, his mind withdrawn in\nthought.\n\n\"Send four helicopters,\" he said slowly, \"to sweep that space. We'll see\nwhat the enemy does.\"\n\nOne of the seated officers opposite him spoke swiftly. Far away a\nroaring set up and was stilled. The helicopters were taking off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey would rush across the blanket of fog, their vertical propellers\nsending blasts of air straight downward. For most of their sweep they\nwould keep a good height, but above the questionable ground they would\nswoop down to barely above the fog-blanket. There their monstrous screws\nwould blow holes in the fog until the ground below was visible. If any\ntanks crawled there, in the spaces the helicopters swept clear, they\nwould be visible at once and would be shelled by batteries miles away,\nbatteries invisible under the artificial cloud-bank.\n\nNo other noises came through the walls of the monster tank. There was a\nfaint, monotonous murmur of the electric generator. There were the\nquiet, crisp orders of the officers behind the general, giving the\nroutine commands that kept the fighting a stalemate.\n\nThe aircraft officer lifted his head, pressing his headphones tightly\nagainst his ears, as if to hear mores clearly.\n\n\"The enemy, sir, has sent sixty fighting machines to attack our\nhelicopters. We sent forty single-seaters as escort.\"\n\n\"Let them fight enough,\" said the general absently, \"to cause the enemy\nto think us desperate for information. Then draw them off.\"\n\nThere was silence again. The steady fingers put pins here and there. An\nenemy tank destroyed here. An American tank encountered an enemy and\nceased to report further. The enemy sent four helicopters in a wide\nsweep behind the American lines, escorted by fifty fighting planes. They\nuncovered a squadron of four tanks, which scattered like insects\ndisturbed by the overturning of a stone. Instantly after their\ndisclosure a hundred and fifty guns, four miles away, were pouring\nshells about the place where they had been seen. Two of the tanks ceased\nto report.\n\nThe general's attention was called to a telephone instrument with its\ncall-light glowing.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the general absently. \"They want publicity matter.\"\n\nThe telephone was connected to the rear, and from there to the Capital.\nA much-worried cabinet waited for news, and arrangements were made and\nhad been used, to broadcast suitably arranged reports from the front,\nthe voice of the commander-in-chief in the field going to every\nworkshop, every gathering-place, and even being bellowed by\nloud-speakers in the city streets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe general took the phone. The President of the United States was at\nthe other end of the wire, this time.\n\n\"General?\"\n\n\"Still in a preliminary stage, sir,\" said the general, without haste.\n\"The enemy is preparing a break-through effort, possibly aimed at our\nmachine-shops and supplies. Of course, if he gets them we will have to\nretreat. An hour ago he paralyzed our radios, not being aware, I\nsuppose, of our tuned earth-induction wireless sets. I daresay he is\npuzzled that our communications have not fallen to pieces.\"\n\n\"But what are our chances?\" The voice of the President was steady, but\nit was strained.\n\n\"His tanks outnumber ours two to one, of course, sir,\" said the general\ncalmly. \"Unless we can divide his fleet and destroy a part of it, of\ncourse we will be crushed in a general combat. But we are naturally\ntrying to make sure that any such action will take place within\npoint-blank range of our artillery, which may help a little. We will cut\nthe fog to secure that help, risking everything, if a general engagement\noccurs.\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\nThe President's voice, when it came, was more strained still.\n\n\"Will you speak to the public, General?\"\n\n\"Three sentences. I have no time for more.\"\n\nThere were little clickings on the line, while the general's eyes\nreturned to the board that was the battlefield in miniature. He\nindicated a spot with his finger.\n\n\"Concentrate our reserve-tanks here,\" he said meditatively. \"Our\nfighting aircraft here. At once.\"\n\nThe two spots were at nearly opposite ends of the battle field. The\nchief of staff, checking the general's judgment with the alert suspicion\nthat was the latest addition to his duties, protested sharply.\n\n\"But sir, our tanks will have no protection against helicopters!\"\n\n\"I am quite aware of it,\" said the general mildly.\n\nHe turned to the transmitter. A thin voice had just announced at the\nother end of the wire, \"The commander-in-chief of the army in the field\nwill make a statement.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe general spoke unhurriedly.\n\n\"We are in contact with the enemy, have been for some hours. We have\nlost forty tanks and the enemy, we think, sixty or more. No general\nengagement has yet taken place, but we think decisive action on the\nenemy's part will be attempted within two hours. The tanks in the field\nneed now, as always, ammunition, spare tanks, and the special supplies\nfor modern warfare. In particular, we require ever-increasing quantities\nof fog-gas. I appeal to your patriotism for reinforcements of material\nand men.\"\n\nHe hung up the receiver and returned to his survey of the board.\n\n\"Those three listening-posts,\" he said abruptly, indicating a place near\nwhere an enemy tank had been destroyed. \"Have they been reoccupied?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Just reported. The tank they reported rolled over them,\ndestroying the placement. They are digging in.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said the general, \"when they cease to report again. They\nwill.\"\n\nHe watched the board again and without lifting his eyes from it, spoke\nagain.\n\n\"That listening-post in the dead sector, with the two strayed\ninfantrymen in it. Was it reported?\"\n\n\"Not yet, sir.\"\n\n\"Tell me immediately it does.\"\n\nThe general leaned back in his chair and deliberately relaxed. He\nlighted a cigar and puffed at it, his hands quite steady. Other\nofficers, scenting the smoke, glanced up enviously. But the general was\nthe only man who might smoke. The enemy's gases, like the American ones,\ncould go through any gas-mask if in sufficient concentration. The tanks\nwere sealed like so many submarines, and opened their interiors to the\nouter air only after that air had been thoroughly tested and proven\nsafe. Only the general might use up more than a man's allowance for\nbreathing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe general gazed about him, letting his mind rest from its intense\nstrain against the greater strain that would come on it in a few\nminutes. He looked at a tall blond man who was surveying the board\nintently, moving away, and returning again, his forehead creased in\nthought.\n\nThe general smiled quizzically. That man was the officer appointed to I.\nI. duty--interpretative intelligence--chosen from a thousand officers\nbecause the most exhaustive psychological tests had proven that his\nbrain worked as nearly as possible like that of the enemy commander. His\ntask was to take the place of the enemy commander, to reconstruct from\nthe enemy movements reported and the enemy movements known as nearly as\npossible the enemy plans.\n\n\"Well, Harlin,\" said the general, \"Where will he strike?\"\n\n\"He's tricky, sir,\" said Harlin. \"That gap in our listening-posts looks,\nof course, like preparation for a massing of his tanks inside our lines.\nAnd it would be logical that he fought off our helicopters to keep them\nfrom discovering his tanks massing in that area.\"\n\nThe general nodded.\n\n\"Quite true,\" he admitted. \"Quite true.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Harlin eagerly. \"He'd know we could figure that out. And he\nmay have wiped out listening posts to make us think he was planning just\nso. He may have fought off our helicopters, not to keep them from\ndiscovering his tanks in there, but to keep them from discovering that\nthere were no tanks in there!\"\n\n\"My own idea exactly,\" said the general meditatively. \"But again, it\nlooks so much like a feint that it may be a serious blow. I dare not\nrisk assuming it to be a feint only.\"\n\nHe turned back to the board.\n\n\"Have those two strayed infantrymen reported yet?\" he asked sharply.\n\n\"Not yet, sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe general drummed on the table. There were four red flashes glowing at\ndifferent points of the board--four points where American tanks or\ngroups of tanks were locked in conflict with the enemy. Somewhere off\nin the enveloping fog that made all the world a gray chaos, lumbering,\ncrawling monsters rammed and battered at each other at infinitely short\nrange. They fought blindly, their guns swinging menacingly and belching\nlurid flames into the semi-darkness, while from all about them dropped\nthe liquids that meant death to any man who breathed their vapor. Those\ngases penetrated any gas-mask, and would even strike through the\nsag-pastes that had made the vesicatory gases of 1918 futile.\n\nWith tanks by thousands hidden in the fog, four small combats were kept\nup, four only. Battles fought with tanks as the main arm are necessarily\nbattles of movement, more nearly akin to cavalry battles than any other\nunless it be fleet actions. When the main bodies come into contact, the\nissue is decided quickly. There can be no long drawn-out stalemates such\nas infantry trenches produced in years past. The fighting that had\ntaken place so far, both under the fog and aloft in the air, was\noutpost skirmishing only. When the main body of the enemy came into\naction it would be like a whirlwind, and the battle would be won or lost\nin a matter of minutes only.\n\nThe general paid no attention to those four conflicts, or their possible\nmeaning.\n\n\"I want to hear from those two strayed infantrymen,\" he said quietly, \"I\nmust base my orders on what they report. The whole battle, I believe,\nhinges on what they have to say.\"\n\nHe fell silent, watching the board without the tense preoccupation he\nhad shown before. He knew the moves he had to make in any of three\neventualities. He watched the board to make sure he would not have to\nmake those moves before he was ready. His whole air was that of waiting:\nthe commander-in-chief of the army of the United States, waiting to hear\nwhat he would be told by two strayed infantrymen, lost in the fog that\ncovered a battlefield.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fog was neither more dense nor any lighter where Corporal Wallis\npaused to roll his pre-war cigarette. The tobacco came from the gassed\nmachine-gunner in the pill-box a few yards off. Sergeant Coffee, three\nyards distant, was a blurred figure. Corporal Wallis put his cigarette\ninto his mouth, struck his match, and puffed delicately.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Corporal Wallis, and cheered considerably. He thought he saw\nSergeant Coffee moving toward him and ungenerously hid his cigarette's\nglow.\n\nOverhead, a machine-gun suddenly burst into a rattling roar, the sound\nsweeping above them with incredible speed. Another gun answered it.\nAbruptly, the whole sky above them was an inferno of such tearing noises\nand immediately after they began a multitudinous bellowing set up.\nAirplanes on patrol ordinarily kept their engines muffled, in hopes of\nlocating a tank below them by its noise. But in actual fighting there\nwas too much power to be gained by cutting out the muffler for any minor\nmotive to take effect. A hundred aircraft above the heads of the two\nstrayed infantrymen were fighting madly about five helicopters. Two\nhundred yards away, one fell to the earth with a crash, and immediately\nafterward there was a hollow boom. For an instant even the mist was\ntinged with yellow from the exploded gasoline tank. But the roaring\nabove continued--not mounting, as in a battle between opposing patrols\nof fighting planes, when each side finds height a decisive advantage,\nbut keeping nearly to the same level, little above the bank of cloud.\n\nSomething came down, roaring, and struck the earth no more than fifty\nyards away. The impact was terrific, but after it there was dead silence\nwhile the thunder above kept on.\n\nSergeant Coffee came leaping to Corporal Wallis' side.\n\n\"Helicopters!\" he barked. \"Huntin' tanks an' pill-boxes! Lay down!\"\n\nHe flung himself down to the earth.\n\nWind beat on them suddenly, then an outrageous blast of icy air from\nabove. For an instant the sky lightened. They saw a hole in the mist,\nsaw the little pill-box clearly, saw a huge framework of supporting\nscrews sweeping swiftly overhead with figures in it watching the ground\nthrough wind-angle glasses, and machine-gunners firing madly at dancing\nthings in the air. Then it was gone.\n\n\"One o' ours,\" shouted Coffee in Wallis' ear. \"They' tryin' to find th'\nYellows' tanks!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe center of the roaring seemed to shift, perhaps to the north. Then a\nroaring drowned out all the other roarings. This one was lower down and\napproaching in a rush. Something swooped from the south, a dark blotch\nin the lighter mist above. It was an airplane flying in the mist, a\nplane that had dived into the fog as into oblivion. It appeared, was\ngone--and there was a terrific crash. A shattering roar drowned out even\nthe droning tumult of a hundred aircraft engines. A sheet of flame\nflashed up, and a thunderous detonation.\n\n\"Hit a tree,\" panted Coffee, scrambling to his feet again. \"Suicide\nclub, aimin' for our helicopter.\"\n\nCorporal Wallis was pointing, his lips drawn back in a snarl.\n\n\"Shut up!\" he whispered. \"I saw a shadow against that flash! Yeller\ninfantryman! Le's get 'im!\"\n\n\"Y'crazy,\" said Sergeant Coffee, but he strained his eyes and more\nespecially his ears.\n\nIt was Coffee who clutched Corporal Wallis' wrist and pointed. Wallis\ncould see nothing, but he followed as Coffee moved silently through the\ngray mist. Presently he too, straining his eyes, saw an indistinct\nmovement.\n\nThe roaring of motors died away suddenly. The fighting had stopped, a\nlong way off, apparently because the helicopters had been withdrawn.\nExcept for the booming of artillery a very long distance away, firing\nunseen at an unseen target, there was no noise at all.\n\n\"Aimin' for our pill-box,\" whispered Coffee.\n\nThey saw the dim shape, moving noiselessly, halt. The dim figure seemed\nto be casting about for something. It went down on hands and knees and\ncrawled forward. The two infantrymen crept after it. It stopped, and\nturned around. The two dodged to one side in haste. The enemy\ninfantryman crawled off in another direction, the two Americans\nfollowing him as closely as they dared.\n\nHe halted once more, a dim and grotesque figure in the fog. They saw him\nfumbling in his belt. He threw something, suddenly. There was a little\ntap as of a fountain pen dropped upon concrete. Then a hissing sound.\nThat was all, but the enemy infantryman waited, as if listening....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two Americans fell upon him as one individual. They bore him to the\nearth and Coffee dragged at his gas-mask, good tactics in a battle where\nevery man carries gas-grenades. He gasped and fought desperately, in a\nseeming frenzy of terror.\n\nThey squatted over him, finally, having taken away his automatics, and\nCoffee worked painstakingly to get off his gas-mask while Wallis went\npoking about in quest of tobacco.\n\n\"Dawggone!\" said Coffee. \"This mask is intricate.\"\n\n\"He ain't got any pockets,\" mourned Wallis.\n\nThen they examined him more closely.\n\n\"It's a whole suit,\" explained Coffee. \"H-m.... He don't have to bother\nwith sag-paste. He's got him on a land diving-suit.\"\n\n\"S-s-say,\" gasped the prisoner, his language utterly colloquial in spite\nof the beady eyes and coarse black hair that marked him racially as of\nthe enemy, \"say, don't take off my mask! Don't take off my mask!\"\n\n\"He talks an' everything,\" observed Coffee in mild amazement. He\ninspected the mask again and painstakingly smashed the goggles. \"Now,\nbig boy, you take your chance with th' rest of us. What' you doin'\naround here?\"\n\nThe prisoner set his teeth, though deathly pale, and did not reply.\n\n\"H'm-m....\" said Coffee meditatively. \"Let's take him in the pill-box\nan' let Loot'n't Madison tell us what to do with him.\"\n\nThey picked him up.\n\n\"No! No! For Gawd's sake, no!\" cried the prisoner shrilly. \"I just\ngassed it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two halted. Coffee scratched his nose.\n\n\"Reckon he's lyin', Pete?\" he asked.\n\nCorporal Wallis shrugged gloomily.\n\n\"He ain't got any tobacco,\" he said morosely. \"Let's chuck him in first\nan' see.\"\n\nThe prisoner wriggled until Coffee put his own automatic in the small of\nhis back.\n\n\"How long does that gas last?\" he asked, frowning. \"Loot'n't Madison\nwants us to report. There's some fellers in there, all gassed up, but we\nwere in there a while back an' it didn't hurt us. How long does it\nlast?\"\n\n\"Fur-fifteen minutes, maybe twenty,\" chattered the prisoner. \"Don't put\nme in there!\"\n\nCoffee scratched his nose again and looked at his wrist-watch.\n\n\"A'right,\" he conceded, \"we give you twenty minutes. Then we chuck you\ndown inside. That is, if you act real agreeable until then. Got anything\nto smoke?\"\n\nThe prisoner agonizedly opened a zipper slip in his costume and brought\nout tobacco, even tailor-made cigarettes. Coffee pounced on them one\nsecond before Wallis. Then he divided them with absorbed and scrupulous\nfairness.\n\n\"Right,\" said Sergeant Coffee comfortably. He lighted up. \"Say, you, if\ny' want to smoke, here's one o' your pills. Let's see the gas stuff.\nHow' y' use it?\"\n\nWallis had stripped off a heavy belt about the prisoner's waist and it\nwas trailing over his arm. He inspected it now. There were twenty or\nthirty little sticks in it, each one barely larger than a lead pencil,\nof dirty gray color, and each one securely nested in a tube of\nflannel-lined papier-mache.\n\n\"These things?\" asked Wallis contentedly. He was inhaling deeply with\nthat luxurious enjoyment a tailor-made cigarette can give a man who had\nbeen remaking butts into smokes for days past.\n\n\"Don't touch 'em,\" warned the prisoner nervously. \"You broke my goggles.\nYou throw 'em, and they light and catch fire, and that scatters the\ngas.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCoffee touched the prisoner, indicating the ground, and sat down,\ncomfortably smoking one of the prisoner's cigarettes. By his air, he\nbegan to approve of his captive.\n\n\"Say, you,\" he said curiously, \"you talk English pretty good. How'd you\nlearn it?\"\n\n\"I was a waiter,\" the prisoner explained. \"New York. Corner Forty-eighth\nand Sixth.\"\n\n\"My Gawd!\" said Coffee. \"Me, I used to be a movie operator along there.\nForty-ninth. Projection room stuff, you know. Say, you know Heine's\nplace?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the prisoner. \"I used to buy Scotch from that blond feller\nin the back room. With a benzine label for a prescription?\"\n\nCoffee lay back and slapped his knee.\n\n\"Ain't it a small world?\" he demanded. \"Pete, here, he ain't never been\nin any town bigger than Chicago. Ever in Chicago?\"\n\n\"Hell,\" said Wallis, morose yet comfortable with a tailor-made\ncigarette. \"If you guys want to start a extra war, go to knockin'\nChicago. That's all.\"\n\nCoffee looked at his wrist-watch again.\n\n\"Got ten minutes yet,\" he observed. \"Say, you must know Pete Hanfry--\"\n\n\"Sure I know him,\" said the enemy prisoner, scornfully. \"I waited on\nhim. One day, just before us reserves were called back home....\"\n\nIn the monster tank that was headquarters the general tapped his fingers\non his knees. The pale white light flickered a little as it shone on the\nboard where the bright sparks crawled. White sparks were American tanks.\nBlue flashes were for enemy tanks sighted and reported, usually in the\nthree-second interval between their identification and the annihilation\nof the observation-post that had reported them. Red glows showed\nencounters between American and enemy tanks. There were a dozen red\nglows visible, with from one to a dozen white sparks hovering about\nthem. It seemed as if the whole front line were about to burst into a\nglare of red, were about to become one long lane of conflicts in\nimpenetrable obscurity, where metal monsters roared and rumbled and\nclanked one against the other, bellowing and belching flame and ramming\neach other savagely, while from them dripped the liquids that made their\nbreath mean death. There were nightmarish conflicts in progress under\nthe blanket of fog, unparalleled save perhaps in the undersea battles\nbetween submarines in the previous European war.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chief of staff looked up; his face drawn.\n\n\"General,\" he said harshly, \"it looks like a frontal attack all along\nour line.\"\n\nThe general's cigar had gone out. He was pale, but calm with an iron\ncomposure.\n\n\"Yes,\" he conceded. \"But you forget that blank spot in our line. We do\nnot know what is happening there.\"\n\n\"I am not forgetting it. But the enemy outnumbers us two to one--\"\n\n\"I am waiting,\" said the general, \"to hear from those two infantrymen\nwho reported some time ago from a listen-post in the dead area.\"\n\nThe chief of staff pointed to the outline formed by the red glows where\ntanks were battling.\n\n\"Those fights are keeping up too long!\" he said sharply. \"General, don't\nyou see, they're driving back our line, but they aren't driving it back\nas fast as if they were throwing their whole weight on it! If they were\nmaking a frontal attack there, they'd wipe out the tanks we have facing\nthem; they'd roll right over them! That's a feint! They're concentrating\nin the dead space--\"\n\n\"I am waiting,\" said the general softly, \"to hear from those two\ninfantrymen.\" He looked at the board again and said quietly, \"Have the\ncall-signal sent them. They may answer.\"\n\nHe struck a match to relight his dead cigar. His fingers barely quivered\nas they held the match. It might have been excitement--but it might have\nbeen foreboding, too.\n\n\"By the way,\" he said, holding the match clear, \"have our machine-shops\nand supply-tanks ready to move. Every plane is, of course, ready to take\nthe air on signal. But get the aircraft ground personnel in their\ntraveling tanks immediately.\"\n\nVoices began to murmur orders as the general puffed. He watched the\nboard steadily.\n\n\"Let me know if anything is heard from these infantrymen....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a definite air of strain within the tank that was\nheadquarters. It was a sort of tensity that seemed to emanate from the\ngeneral himself.\n\nWhere Coffee and Wallis and the prisoner squatted on the ground,\nhowever, there was no sign of strain at all. There was a steady gabble\nof voices.\n\n\"What kinda rations they give you?\" asked Coffee interestedly.\n\nThe enemy prisoner listed them, with profane side-comments.\n\n\"Hell,\" said Wallis gloomily. \"Y'ought to see what we get! Las' week\nthey fed us worse'n dogs. An' th' canteen stuff--\"\n\n\"Your tank men, they get treated fancy?\" asked the prisoner.\n\nCoffee made a reply consisting almost exclusively of high powered\nexpletives.\n\n\"--and the infantry gets it in the neck every time,\" he finished\nsavagely. \"We do the work--\"\n\nGuns began to boom, far away. Wallis cocked his ears.\n\n\"Tanks gettin' together,\" he judged, gloomily. \"If they'd all blow each\nother to hell an' let us infantry fight this battle--\"\n\n\"Damn the tanks!\" said the enemy prisoner viciously. \"Look here, you\nfellers. Look at me. They sent a battalion of us out, in two waves. We\nhike along by compass through the fog, supposed to be five paces apart.\nWe come on a pill-box or listenin' post, we gas it an' go on. We try not\nto make a noise. We try not to get seen before we use our gas. We go on,\ndeep in your lines as we can. We hear one of your tanks, we dodge it if\nwe can, so we don't get seen at all. O'course we give it a dose of gas\nin passing, just in case. But we don't get any orders about how far to\ngo or how to come back. We ask for recognition signals for our own\ntanks, an' they grin an' say we won't see none of our tanks till the\nbattle's over. They say 'Re-form an' march back when the fog is out.'\nAin't that pretty for you?\"\n\n\"You second wave?\" asked Coffee, with interest.\n\nThe prisoner nodded.\n\n\"Mopping up,\" he said bitterly, \"what the first wave left. No fun in\nthat! We go along gassin' dead men, an' all the time your tanks is\nravin' around to find out what's happenin' to their listenin'-posts.\nThey run into us--\"\n\nCoffee nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"The infantry always gets the dirty end of the stick,\" said Wallis\nmorosely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomewhere, something blew up with a violent explosion. The noise of\nbattle in the distance became heavier and heavier.\n\n\"Goin' it strong,\" said the prisoner, listening.\n\n\"Yeh,\" said Coffee. He looked at his wrist-watch. \"Say, that twenty\nminutes is up. You go down in there first, big boy.\"\n\nThey stood beside the little pill-box. The prisoner's knees shook.\n\n\"Say, fellers,\" he said pleadingly, \"they told us that stuff would\nscatter in twenty minutes, but you busted my mask. Yours ain't any good\nagainst this gas. I'll have to go down in there if you fellers make me,\nbut--\"\n\nCoffee lighted another of the prisoner's tailor-made cigarettes.\n\n\"Give you five minutes more,\" he said graciously. \"I don't suppose it'll\nruin the war.\"\n\nThey sat down relievedly again, while the fog-gas made all the earth\ninvisible behind a pall of grayness, a grayness from which the noises of\nbattle came.\n\nIn the tank that was headquarters, the air of strain was pronounced. The\nmaneuver-board showed the situation as close to desperation, now. The\nreserve-tank positions had been switched on the board, dim orange glows,\nmassed in curiously precise blocks. And little squares of green showed\nthere that the supply and machine-shop tanks were massed. They were\nmoving slowly across the maneuver-board. But the principal change lay in\nthe front-line indications.\n\nThe red glows that showed where tank battles were in progress formed an\nirregularly curved line, now. There were twenty or more such isolated\nbattles in progress, varying from single combats between single tanks to\ngreater conflicts where twenty to thirty tanks to a side were engaged.\nAnd the positions of those conflicts were changing constantly, and\ninvariably the American tanks were being pushed back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two staff officers behind the general were nearly silent. There were\nfew sparks crawling within the American lines now. Nearly every one had\nbeen diverted into the front-line battles. The two men watched the board\nwith feverish intensity, watching the red glows moving back, and\nback....\n\nThe chief of staff was shaking like a leaf, watching the American line\nstretched, and stretched....\n\nThe general looked at him with a twisted smile.\n\n\"I know my opponent,\" he said suddenly. \"I had lunch with him once in\nVienna. We were attending a disarmament conference.\" He seemed to be\namused at the ironic statement. \"We talked war and battles, of course.\nAnd he showed me, drawing on the tablecloth, the tactical scheme that\nshould have been used at Cambrai, back in 1917. It was a singularly\nperfect plan. It was a beautiful one.\"\n\n\"General,\" burst out one of the two staff officers behind him. \"I need\ntwenty tanks from the reserves.\"\n\n\"Take them,\" said the general. He went on, addressing his chief of\nstaff. \"It was an utterly flawless plan. I talked to other men. We were\nall pretty busy estimating each other there, we soldiers. We discussed\neach other with some freedom, I may say. And I formed the opinion that\nthe man who is in command of the enemy is an artist: a soldier with the\nspirit of an amateur. He's a very skilful fencer, by the way. Doesn't\nthat suggest anything?\"\n\nThe chief of staff had his eyes glued to the board.\n\n\"That is a feint, sir. A strong feint, yes, but he has his force\nconcentrated in the dead area.\"\n\n\"You are not listening, sir,\" said the general, reprovingly. \"I am\nsaying that my opponent is an artist, an amateur, the sort of person who\ndelights in the delicate work of fencing. I, sir, would thank God for\nthe chance to defeat my enemy. He has twice my force, but he will not\nbe content merely to defeat me. He will want to defeat me by a plan of\nconsummate artistry, which will arouse admiration among soldiers for\nyears to come.\"\n\n\"But General, every minute, every second--\"\n\n\"We are losing men, of whom we have plenty, and tanks, of which we have\nnot enough. True, very true,\" conceded the general. \"But I am waiting to\nhear from two strayed infantrymen. When they report, I will speak to\nthem myself.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" cried the chief of staff, withheld only by the iron habit of\ndiscipline from violent action and the taking over of command himself,\n\"they may be dead! You can't risk this battle waiting for them! You\ncan't risk it, sir! You can't!\"\n\n\"They are not dead,\" said the general coolly. \"They cannot be dead.\nSometimes, sir, we must obey the motto on our coins. Our country needs\nthis battle to be won. We have got to win it, sir! And the only way to\nwin it--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe signal-light at his telephone glowed. The general snatched it up,\nhis hands quivering. But his voice, was steady and deliberate as he\nspoke.\n\n\"Hello, Sergeant--Sergeant Coffee, is it?... Very well, Sergeant. Tell\nme what you've found out.... Your prisoner objects to his rations, eh?\nVery well, go on.... How did he gas our listening-posts?... He did, eh?\nHe got turned around and you caught him wandering about?... Oh, he was\nsecond wave! They weren't taking any chances on any of our\nlistening-posts reporting their tanks, eh?... Say that again, Sergeant\nCoffee!\" The general's tone had changed indescribably. \"Your prisoner\nhas no recognition signals for his own tanks? They told him he wouldn't\nsee any of them until the battle was over?... Thank you, Sergeant. One\nof our tanks will stop for you. This is the commanding general\nspeaking.\"\n\nHe rang off, his eyes blazing. Relaxation was gone. He was a dynamo,\nsnapping orders.\n\n\"Supply tanks, machine-shop tanks, ground forces of the air service,\nconcentrate here!\" His finger rested on a spot in the middle of the dead\narea. \"Reserve tanks take position behind them. Draw off every tank\nwe've got--take 'em out of action!--and mass them in front, on a line\nwith our former first line of outposts. Every airplane and helicopter\ntake the air and engage in general combat with the enemy, wherever the\nenemy may be found and in whatever force. And our tanks move straight\nthrough here!\"\n\nOrders were snapping into telephone transmitters. The commands had been\nrelayed before their import was fully realized. Then there was a gasp.\n\n\"General!\" cried the chief of staff. \"If the enemy is massed there,\nhe'll destroy our forces in detail as they take position!\"\n\n\"He isn't massed there,\" said the general, his eyes blazing. \"The\ninfantrymen who were gassing our listening-posts were given no\nrecognition signals for their tanks. Sergeant Coffee's prisoner has his\ngas-mask broken and is in deadly fear. The enemy commander is foolish in\nmany ways, perhaps, but not foolish enough to break down morale by\nrefusing recognition signals to his own men who will need them. And look\nat the beautiful plan he's got.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sketched half a dozen lines with his fingers, moving them in\nlightning gestures as his orders took effect.\n\n\"His main force is here, behind those skirmishes that look like a feint.\nAs fast as we reinforce our skirmishing-line, he reinforces his--just\nenough to drive our tanks back slowly. It looks like a strong feint, but\nit's a trap! This dead space is empty. He thinks we are concentrating to\nface it. When he is sure of it--his helicopters will sweep across any\nminute, now, to see--he'll throw his whole force on our front line.\nIt'll crumple up. His whole fighting force will smash through to take\nus, facing the dead space, in the rear! With twice our numbers, he'll\ndrive us before him.\"\n\n\"But general! You're ordering a concentration there! You're falling in\nwith his plans!\"\n\nThe general laughed.\n\n\"I had lunch with the general in command over there, once upon a time.\nHe is an artist. He won't be content with a defeat like that! He'll want\nto make his battle a masterpiece, a work of art! There's just one touch\nhe can add. He has to have reserves to protect his supply-tanks and\nmachine-shops. They're fixed. The ideal touch, the perfect tactical\nfillip, will be--Here! Look. He expects to smash in our rear, here. The\nheaviest blow will fall here. He will swing around our right wing, drive\nus out of the dead area into his own lines--and drive us on his\nreserves! Do you see it? He'll use every tank he's got in one beautiful\nfinal blow. We'll be outwitted, out-numbered, out-flanked and finally\ncaught between his main body and his reserves and pounded to bits. It is\na perfect, a masterly bit of work!\"\n\nHe watched the board, hawklike.\n\n\"We'll concentrate, but our machine-shops and supplies will concentrate\nwith us. Before he has time to take us in rear we'll drive ahead, in\njust the line he plans for us! We don't wait to be driven into his\nreserves. We roll into them and over them! We smash his supplies! We\ndestroy his shops! And then we can advance along his line of\ncommunication and destroy it, our own depots being blown up--give the\norders when necessary--and leaving him stranded with motor-driven tanks,\nmotorized artillery, and nothing to run his motors with! He'll be\nmarooned beyond help in the middle of our country, and we will have him\nat our mercy when his tanks run out of fuel. As a matter of fact, I\nshall expect him to surrender in three days.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little blocks of green and yellow that had showed the position of\nthe reserve and supply-tanks, changed abruptly to white, and began to\ncrawl across the maneuver-board. Other little white sparks turned about.\nEvery white spark upon the maneuver-board suddenly took to itself a new\ndirection.\n\n\"Disconnect cables,\" said the general, crisply. \"We move with our tanks,\nin the lead!\"\n\nThe monotonous humming of the electric generator was drowned out in a\nthunderous uproar that was muffled as an air-tight door was shut\nabruptly. Fifteen seconds later there was a violent lurch, and the\ncolossal tank was on the move in the midst of a crawling, thundering\nhorde of metal monsters whose lumbering progress shook the earth.\n\nSergeant Coffee, still blinking his amazement, absent-mindedly lighted\nthe last of his share of the cigarettes looted from the prisoner.\n\n\"The big guy himself!\" he said, still stunned. \"My Gawd! The big guy\nhimself!\"\n\nA distant thunder began, a deep-toned rumbling that seemed to come from\nthe rear. It came nearer and grew louder. A peculiar quivering seemed to\nset up in the earth. The noise was tanks moving through the fog, not one\ntank or two tanks, or twenty tanks, but all the tanks in creation\nrumbling and lurching at their topmost speed in serried array.\n\nCorporal Wallis heard, and turned pale. The prisoner heard, and his\nknees caved in.\n\n\"Hell,\" said Corporal Wallis dispairingly. \"They can't see us, an' they\ncouldn't dodge us if they did!\"\n\nThe prisoner wailed, and slumped to the floor.\n\nCoffee picked him up by the collar and jerked him out of the pill-box.\n\n\"C'mon Pete,\" he ordered briefly. \"They ain't givin' us a infantryman's\nchance, but maybe we can do some dodgin'!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the roar of engines, of metal treads crushing upon earth and\nclinking upon their joints, drowned out all possible other sounds.\nBefore the three men beside the pill-box could have moved a muscle,\nmonster shapes loomed up, rushing, rolling, lurching, squeaking. They\nthundered past, and the hot fumes of their exhausts enveloped the trio.\n\nCoffee growled and put himself in a position of defiance, his feet\nbraced against the concrete of the pill-box dome. His expression was\nsnarling and angry but, surreptitiously, he crossed himself. He heard\nthe fellows of the two tanks that had roared by him, thundering along in\nalignment to right and left. A twenty-yard space, and a second row of\nthe monsters came hurtling on, gun muzzles gaping, gas-tubes elevated,\nspitting smoke from their exhausts that was even thicker than the fog. A\nthird row, a fourth, a fifth....\n\nThe universe was a monster uproar. One could not think in this volume of\nsound. It seemed that there was fighting overhead. Crackling noises came\nfeebly through the reverberating uproar that was the army of the United\nStates in full charge. Something came whirling down through the\noverhanging mist and exploded in a lurid flare that for a second or two\ncast the grotesque shadows of a row of tanks clearly before the trio of\nshaken infantrymen.\n\nStill the tanks came on and roared past. Twenty tanks, twenty-one ...\ntwenty-two.... Coffee lost count, dazed and almost stunned by the sheer\nnoise. It rose from the earth and seemed to be echoed back from the\ntopmost limit of the skies. It was a colossal din, an incredible uproar,\na sustained thunder that beat at the eardrums like the reiterated\nconcussions of a thousand guns that fired without ceasing. There was no\nintermission, no cessation of the tumult. Row after row after row of the\nmonsters roared by, beaked and armed, going greedily with hungry guns\ninto battle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, for a space of seconds, no tanks passed. Through the\npandemonium of their going, however, the sound of firing somehow seemed\nto creep. It was gunfire of incredible intensity, and it came from the\ndirection in which the front-rank tanks were heading.\n\n\"Forty-eight, forty-nine, forty-ten, forty-'leven,\" muttered Coffee\ndazedly, his senses beaten down almost to unconsciousness by the ordeal\nof sound. \"Gawd! The whole army went by!\"\n\nThe roaring of the fighting-tanks was less, but it was still a monstrous\ndin. Through it, however, came now a series of concussions that were so\nclose together that they were inseparable, and so violent that they were\nlike slaps upon the chest.\n\nThen came other noises, louder only because nearer. These were different\nnoises, too, from those the fighting-tanks had made. Lighter noises. The\ncurious, misshapen service tanks began to rush by, of all sizes and all\nshapes. Fuel-carrier tanks. Machine-shop tanks, huge ones, these.\nCommissary tanks....\n\nSomething enormous and glistening stopped short. A door opened. A voice\nroared an order. The three men, beaten and whipped by noise, stared\ndumbly.\n\n\"Sergeant Coffee!\" roared the voice. \"Bring your men! Quick!\"\n\nCoffee dragged himself back to a semblance of life. Corporal Wallis\nmoved forward, sagging. The two of them loaded their prisoner into the\ndoor and tumbled in. They were instantly sent into a heap as the tank\ntook up its progress again with a sudden sharp leap.\n\n\"Good man,\" grinned a sooty-faced officer, clinging to a handhold. \"The\ngeneral sent special orders you were to be picked up. Said you'd won the\nbattle. It isn't finished yet, but when the general says that--\"\n\n\"Battle?\" said Coffee dully. \"This ain't my battle. It's a parade of a\nlot of damn tanks!\"\n\nThere was a howl of joy from somewhere above. Discipline in the\nmachine-shop tanks was strict enough, but vastly different in kind from\nthe formality of the fighting-machines.\n\n\"Contact!\" roared the voice again. \"General wireless is going again! Our\nfellows have rolled over their reserves and are smashing their\nmachine-shops and supplies!\"\n\nYells reverberated deafeningly inside the steel walls, already filled\nwith tumult from the running motors and rumbling treads.\n\n\"Smashed 'em up!\" shrieked the voice above, insane with joy. \"Smashed\n'em! Smashed 'em! Smashed 'em! We've wiped out their whole reserve\nand--\" A series of detonations came through even the steel shell of the\nlurching tank. Detonations so violent, so monstrous, that even through\nthe springs and treads of the tank the earth-concussion could be felt.\n\"There goes their ammunition! We set off all their dumps!\"\n\nThere was sheer pandemonium inside the service-tank, speeding behind the\nfighting force with only a thin skin of reserve-tanks between it and a\npanic-stricken, mechanically pursuing enemy.\n\n\"Yell, you birds!\" screamed the voice. \"The general says we've won the\nbattle! Thanks to the fighting force! We're to go on and wipe out the\nenemy line of communications, letting him chase us till his gas gives\nout! Then we come back and pound him to bits! Our tanks have wiped him\nout!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCoffee managed to find something to hold on to. He struggled to his\nfeet. Corporal Wallis, recovering from the certainty of death and the\ntorture of sound, was being very sea-sick from the tank's motion. The\nprisoner moved away from him on the steel floor. He looked gloomily up\nat Coffee.\n\n\"Listen to 'em,\" said Coffee bitterly. \"Tanks! Tanks! Tanks! Hell! If\nthey'd given us infantry a chance--\"\n\n\"You said it,\" said the prisoner savagely. \"This is a hell of a way to\nfight a war.\"\n\nCorporal Wallis turned a greenish face to them.\n\n\"The infantry always gets the dirty end of the stick,\" he gasped. \"Now\nthey--now they' makin' infantry ride in tanks! Hell!\"\n\n\n\n\nInvisible Death\n\n_By Anthony Pelcher_\n\n[Illustration: _Wildly racing through the night, missing other cars by a\nbreath, the visible car continued its pursuit of--what?_]\n\n[Sidenote: On Lees' quick and clever action depended the life of \"Old\nPerk\" Ferguson, the millionaire manufacturer threatened by the uncanny,\ninvisible killer.]\n\n\nThe inquest into the mysterious death of Darius Darrow, savant,\ninventor, recluse and eccentric, resembled a scientific convention. Men\nand women of high scientific attainment, and, in some instances, world\nfame, attended to hear first hand the strange, uncanny, unbelievable\ncircumstances as hinted by the newspapers.\n\nMrs. Susan Darrow, the widow, was the paramount witness. She appeared a\nquaint figure as she took the stand. Tearful, yet alert, this little\nwoman betrayed the intelligence that had made her one of the world's\nforemost chemists. She gave her age as fifty-eight, but if it had not\nbeen for her snowy hair she would have looked much younger. She was\nsmall but not frail, and had expressive blue eyes. She had a firm little\nnose and chin, and was garbed in black silk garments of a fashion\nevidently dating back a decade.\n\nAlthough not modern in dress, her answers to questions regarding\nscientific and business affairs involved in the mysterious case, proved\nshe was thoroughly abreast of the times in all other particulars.\n\n\"You believe your husband was murdered?\" bluntly asked the examiner at\none stage.\n\n\"That is my opinion,\" she said, then added: \"It might have been some\nscientific accident, the nature of which I cannot fathom. We were\nconfidential in all matters except my husband's work. He reserved the\nright to be secretive about the scientific problems on which he was\nworking.\"\n\n\"Can you throw any light on a motive for such a crime?\"\n\n\"The motive seems self-evident. He was working on an invention that he\nsaid would do away with war and would make the owner of the device a\npractical world dictator, should he choose to exercise such power. The\ndevice was completed. The murderer killed him to secure his device. That\nall seems plain enough.\"\n\n\"Was anything else of value taken?\"\n\n\"We had nothing else of value about the place. I was never given to\njewelry. The furnishings and equipment were undisturbed. It is quite\nevident, I think, that the thief was no ordinary petty burglar.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe attorney interposed: \"I believe we had better let Mrs. Darrow tell\nthis story from the beginning in her own way. There are only two really\nimportant witnesses. Whatever she can remember to recite might be of\nvalue to the authorities. Now, Mrs. Darrow, how long had you lived at\nBrooknook? Begin there and just let your story unfold. Try to control\nyour nerves and emotions.\"\n\n\"I am not emotional. I am not nervous,\" said the quaint little woman,\nbravely. \"My heart hurts, that is all.\n\n\"The place was named by my father. We inherited it at his death, thirty\nyears ago, and moved in. My two children were born and died there. At\nfirst we kept the servants and maintained all of the thirty-two rooms.\nBut after the children were gone, we both gave ourselves over to study\nand we began to close one room after another, releasing the servants one\nby one.\"\n\n\"How many rooms do you occupy now?\"\n\n\"We lived in three, a living-room, kitchen and bedroom. The two big\nparlors were turned into a laboratory. We both worked there. It was\nthere my husband met his death at his work. Sometimes we worked\ntogether, sometimes independently. I did all my own housework, except\nthe laundry, which I sent out. We had no visitors. We lived for each\nother and our work.\"\n\n\"Tell us about the rooms that were not occupied.\"\n\n\"We left them just as they always had been. I have not been in any of\nthese rooms for twenty years. Once I looked into the little girl's\nroom--my daughter's room. It was dusty and cobwebby, but undisturbed by\nhuman hand. My husband peered in over my shoulder. I closed the door. We\nturned away in each other's arms.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere the little old woman fell to weeping softly into her lace\nhandkerchief. Minutes lapsed as the court waited, respecting her grief.\n\n\"Were these rooms locked?\" asked the attorney finally.\n\n\"No,\" said the widow, recovering, as she dabbed at her eyes. \"We feared\nno one. All the rooms were closed, but not locked. The outside doors\nwere seldom locked. We lived in our own world. For appearance sake we\nkept up the grounds. Peck, the gardener, kept the grounds, as you know.\nHe called in outside help when necessary. This was his affair. We never\nbothered him. He lived probably a half mile up the road. The first of\neach month he would come for his pay. He was practically our only\nvisitor.\n\n\"When it was necessary to see our attorney or other connections, Peck\nwould drive us. At first he used to drive our horses. Ten years ago we\npastured the horses for life and bought the small car. We seldom went\nout. We have no close friends and no relatives nearer than the Pacific\ncoast. They are distant cousins. You see, we were rather alone in the\nworld since the children went away--we never spoke of them as being\ndead.\"\n\nAgain the court was hushed. The coroner and the attorney took occasion\nto blow their noses rather violently.\n\n\"On May 27th, the day your husband died, what happened, as you\nre-remember it?\" asked the attorney.\n\n\"We arose and had breakfast as usual. I was puttering about the rooms.\nMy husband kissed me and started for the laboratory. I was in the\nkitchen. It was about ten o'clock when I finished in the kitchen and\nwent into the living room which adjoins the laboratory. I had been\nrather fretted, something unusual for me. It seemed I dimly sensed the\npresence of someone near me, someone I did not know, an outsider. I\nthought it was foolish of me and buckled up.\n\n\"But when I went into the living room, it seemed as if some invisible\npresence were following me. I could hear the low hum of my husband's\ndevice. The door of the laboratory was open. He called to me and said:\n\n\"'Sue dear, it seems strange, but I made two models of this set and now\nI can find only one. You could not have misplaced the other by any\nchance, could you?'\n\n\"I assured him I knew nothing of it and he said, 'Hum-m, that's funny.'\nThen he went back into the library and closed the door. The humming\ncontinued. I was more annoyed than ever, but I did not want to bother my\nhusband. Then a queer thing happened. I saw the door of the laboratory\nopen and close, but I did not see anyone. The next instant, I heard my\nhusband's outcry. It was more a groan than a scream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I rushed into the laboratory. My husband was lying by his slate-topped\ntable. The device, I noticed, was gone. It was no bigger than a\ncoffee-mill, I thought, as I bent over my husband. Strange how such a\nthought could have crowded in at such a time.\n\n\"My husband's head was bleeding. It was cut, a long gash over the ear,\njust below the bald spot. It must have been a frightful blow. I looked\nin his eyes. My nurse's and pharmaceutical course gave me knowledge\nwhich sent a chill to my heart. He was dead. I must have fainted.\n\n\"When I recovered I ran for Peck. I found him near the house, coming my\nway and holding his right eye.\n\n\"'Something struck me,' he said. Then, seeing me so pale, he said, 'My\nGod! Mrs. Darrow, what has happened?'\n\n\"'Run for the doctor,' I said. When the doctor came he called the police\nand coroner. They told me not to disturb the body. Later they took it\naway, and the gardener told me--\"\n\n\"Never mind what Peck told you,\" interrupted the attorney. \"We will let\nhim tell it. Is that all you can tell us about the death itself?\"\n\nBut the widow was weeping now, so violently that the court ordered her\nexcused.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gardener was called and took the stand displaying a big, black eye,\nwhich offered comedy relief to a pathetic situation.\n\n\"On the main road to the east,\" he began after preliminary questioning,\n\"was a small car which had been parked there all morning. I noticed it\nbecause it had no license plates. It was visible from the inside of the\ngrounds, but was hidden from the road by a hedge. It made me wonder\nbecause it was just inside our grounds.\n\n\"I had some very special red flags which I planted as a border back of\npink geraniums. They were doing fine. I got them from the Fabrish seed\nhouse. There are no plants like Fabrish's--I wouldn't give a snap of my\nfinger for all the other--\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" interrupted the attorney. He told the gardener to never\nmind the geraniums and flags, but to tell just what happened.\n\n\"Well, I was bending over the border bed when I heard sounds like\nsomeone running along the gravel path towards me. I heard a humming like\na bumble bee and I jumped to my feet. Just then something hit me in the\neye and knocked me down. Yes sir, knocked me plumb down, and--\"\n\n\"Then what happened? Never mind the asides, the extras--tell us just the\nsimple facts,\" instructed the attorney.\n\n\"Well, you won't believe it, but I heard the footsteps leave the road.\nThe geraniums were badly trampled. I looked at the parked automobile and\ncould hear the hum coming from there.\n\n\"The machine started and turned into the road--\"\n\n\"Did you notice anyone at the wheel?\"\n\n\"That's what you're not going to believe. There wasn't anybody in that\nauto at all. I didn't see anyone at any time. The auto started itself,\nand what is more, that auto only went about a hundred yards when it\ndisappeared altogether--like that--like a flash.\"\n\n\"Did it turn off the road?\"\n\n\"I didn't turn anywhere. It was in the middle of the road. It just\ndisappeared right in the middle of the road. It started without a\ndriver, it turned north without a driver, and went on by itself for\nabout a hundred yards. Then it vanished in the middle of the road. Just\ndropped out of sight.\"\n\nThe court-room was hushed. The audience and court attaches were awe\nstricken and looked their incredulity.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell us that auto drove itself?\" asked the court\nsternly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe witness was completely confused. The attorney came to his rescue,\nlooked at the court, and said:\n\n\"He has told that same story a hundred times, and he will stick to it.\nIt seems impossible, but has not Mrs. Darrow told us she heard this\nhumming and saw nothing? With the purely perfunctory recitals of the\ndoctor and the constabulary this court and the jury have heard all there\nis to hear. We have no more witnesses. That is all there is.\n\n\"The jury will have to decide from the evidence whether this case is\naccident or murder. The doctor and two experts have reported that the\nwound appeared to have been made by some blunt instrument, swung\npowerfully. The skull under the wound and back of the ear was simply\ncrushed. Death was instantaneous. It all happened in broad daylight.\"\n\nAfter an hour's deliberation the jury decided the savant came to his\ndeath in his laboratory from a blow on the skull received in some manner\nunknown.\n\nThe crowd filed out, spiritedly discussing the unusual crime. In the\ncrowd was Perkins Ferguson, known as \"Old Perk,\" head of the Schefert\nEngineering Corporation, who paid royalty on some of the Darrow patents.\nWith him was Damon Farnsworth, his first vice-president.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of it?\" asked Farnsworth, biting into a black\ncigar.\n\n\"Damned weird, isn't it?\" replied \"Old Perk.\" \"I have my own theory,\nhowever,\" he added, \"but I am going to know a whole lot more about this\ncase before I venture it.\" The pair climbed into Ferguson's car\ndiscussing the Darrow death case with furrowed brows.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat might be termed an extraordinary meeting of the directors of the\nSchefert Engineering Corporation, was held a few days later in a big\nbuilding in the financial district.\n\nThe rich furnishings of the directors' room indicated, better than\nBradstreet's, the great wealth of the corporation. Uniformed pages stood\nat attention at each end of the long, mahogany table at which were\nseated the fourteen directors of the company. All were men of wealth,\nstanding and engineering knowledge. The departed Darrow often had been\nsummoned to such meetings, and at this one there was a hush because of\nhis recent demise.\n\nAfter a batch of preliminary business had been transacted, Ferguson\narose and cleared his throat. The directors leaned forward in their\nchairs expectantly. The page boys lost their mechanical attitude for the\ninstant and fairly craned their necks around the bulks of the forms in\nfront of them.\n\n\"The Darrow case has taken a sudden and sinister turn,\" said the\npresident. \"I have a letter. I will read it:\n\n     \"Old Perk: Get wise to yourself. We are in a position to destroy\n     you and all the pot-bellies in the Wall Street crowd. If you want\n     to die of old age, remember what happened to Darrow and begin\n     declaring us in on Wall Street dividends. If you do not you will\n     follow Darrow in the same way.\n\n     \"Our first demand is for $100,000. Leave this amount in hundreds\n     and fifties in the rubbish can at the corner of 50th Street and\n     Broadway at 10 A. M. next Thursday. If you fail we will break your\n     damned neck. Bring the police with you if you like.\n\n     Invisible Death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFerguson passed the letter around for inspection. It was painstakingly\nprinted, evidently from the type in a rubber stamp set such as is sold\nin toy stores.\n\n\"I have decided,\" said Perkins at length, \"to give this case to Walter\nLees. He has never failed us in mechanical, chemical, or any form of\nscientific problem. I hope he will not fail in this. He will work\nindependently of the police, who have requested that we keep the\nappointment at 50th Street and Broadway at the hour named. We will\ndeposit a roll of newspapers, around which has been wrapped a fifty\ndollar bill and then we will stand by while the awaiting detectives do\ntheir duty.\"\n\n\"You do not think anyone is going to call for any supposed package of\nmoney at one of the most congested corners in the world in broad\ndaylight?\" asked a director at the end of the table.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Ferguson. \"A seedy individual could pick a package from\na rubbish bin at that corner without attracting the least attention.\"\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" agreed the doubting one.\n\n\"I know I'm right,\" said the president. And he usually was.\n\n\"I have already arranged to have Lees instructed in his work,\" Ferguson\nvolunteered as a pause came in the buzz of conversation about the table.\n\"Lees is young, but he is capable.\" There was general discussion of the\nstrange case of Darius Darrow; the room filled with the blue haze of\nmany cigars.\n\nSuddenly a low, humming sound was heard in the room.\n\nPapers on the directors' table were bunched as if by unseen hands, and\nthrown to the ceiling, from which they descended like flakes of snow and\nscattered about the room.\n\nA book of minutes was torn from the hands of a secretary. It was raised\nand brought down on vice-president Farnsworth's head. A chair was pulled\nout from under another direction and he was deposited in an undignified\nheap on the floor.\n\nAnother director acted as though he had been tripped, and he fell on top\nof Farnsworth. Two big vases crashed to the floor in bits. Other\ndecorative objects were scattered about.\n\nThe directors who had been hurtled to the floor stood up with\nexpressions of comical surprise on their features. Their chairs\ncatapulted into a far corner of the room, one after the other.\n\nStartled expressions resounded from the group.\n\nA small bookcase fell on its front with a crash of glass. Ferguson's\ncane jumped in the air and crashed a window pane.\n\nThe humming ceased suddenly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe room was a wreck. The assembled men stood aghast. They were simply\nnonplussed. Finally they phoned for the police.\n\nAfter hearing the strange recital from so many highly reputable\nwitnesses, a detective sergeant, who had responded to the call with\nothers, reported to headquarters.\n\nA uniformed police guard was sent to the place with instructions to\nremain on duty until relieved.\n\nFerguson sent for Walter Lees, the young engineer of whom he had spoken\nto the directorate. Assigned to the task of unraveling the Darrow death\nmystery, Lees ran true to form by getting busy at once. This was at\nmidnight of the day of the surprising directors' meeting. Lees owned a\nbig car; he piled into it and started for the scene of the crime.\n\nDaybreak found him examining every inch of the road around the Darrow\nestate. Then he searched the hedge along the east road, where the\nphantom auto had disappeared after the crime. The brush along the\nopposite side of the thoroughfare was also gone over.\n\nPassing autos had stopped to ask the meaning of his flashlight. Lees\nexplained he had lost a pocketbook. It was as good an excuse as any and\nserved to keep him from drawing a crowd. He found nothing to reward his\nlong and painstaking efforts.\n\nAt seven A. M. he decided to interview the Darrow widow, and found her\nalready up and about her kitchen, weeping softly as she worked.\n\nShe bade him be seated in the living room.\n\n\"No, I am not afraid to stay here alone,\" she said in reply to Lees'\nfirst question. \"Whoever killed my husband did so to get possession of\nhis second model. They had already stolen the first. I have thought\nsince that they were afraid that the finding of the second model after\nhis death would aid in their detection. For some reason they had to have\nboth models.\"\n\nShe agreed to tell all she knew of the case. Lees listened to the long\nrecital as already recorded at the coroner's inquest. By adroit\nquestioning Lees gained just one new fact. Mrs. Darrow remembered that\nshe had called her husband, just before he retired to his laboratory, to\nfix a towel hanger in the kitchen. \"He found the pivot needed oiling,\"\nexplained the widow. \"That was all. He oiled it and went into the\nlaboratory.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe idea of one of the world's greatest mechanical engineers stopping\nhis work to oil a towel hanger caused Lees to smile, but Mrs. Darrow did\nnot smile.\n\n\"My husband was a genius at repairing about the house,\" she said, in all\nseriousness.\n\n\"I can imagine so,\" agreed Lees.\n\nThe conversation ceased. Lees sat for a few minutes with his head in his\nhands, thinking deeply. Finally he said:\n\n\"I am convinced that someone who was well aware of your husband's habits\ncommitted this crime. Do you believe, positively, that the gardener is\nabove suspicion?\"\n\n\"Oh, it couldn't have been Peck,\" insisted Mrs. Darrow. \"I had seen him\ndown near the gate from the window. He was too far from the house, and\nbesides, he was devoted to us both.\"\n\n\"Then it was somebody from the neighborhood,\" said Lees.\n\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Mrs. Darrow, noncommittally.\n\n\"Who lives in the next house south?\"\n\n\"That is towards the city,\" mused the widow. \"There are no houses south\non either side of the road for a little further than a mile, when you\nreach the town limits of Farsdale. The town line is about half-way\nbetween, and marks the southern end of this estate.\"\n\n\"Who lives in the first house to the north?\"\n\n\"That is the cottage of Peck, the gardener.\"\n\n\"How near is the next house?\"\n\n\"That was the parcel my father sold. It is about three acres, and in the\ncenter, or about the center, is the house built by Adolph Jouret, who\nbought the land. He lives there with his daughter. They built a\nmagnificent place. The brook that traverses our grounds rises at a\nspring back of his house. Save for two West Indian servants, they are\nalone. The servants live in Farsdale and motor back and forth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What do you know of this--what's his name?\" queried Lees, who had\nassumed the role of examiner.\n\n\"Jouret? Very little. He is some sort of a circus man or showman, or was\nbefore he retired. He once had wealth, but my husband, some weeks ago,\nsaid that because of ill-advised investments he was not so well rated as\nformerly. I had the feeling that he might be forced to give up the\nplace. I just felt that. I never heard it. I am so sorry because of the\ndaughter. She is a beautiful girl, and seemed kindly, the one time I saw\nher. She was about twelve then. I do not like to say it, but she seemed\na little dazed or slow witted, but really beautiful.\" Mrs. Darrow fell\nto smoothing out the folds in her house apron as Lees asked:\n\n\"When was the only time you saw her?\"\n\n\"Ten years ago, about. Just after my father's death. They called on us.\nWe did not care to continue the friendship, as Jouret seemed a little\nflamboyant--his circus nature, I suppose. Anyway, we were quiet folks,\nand there was no need of close association with neighbors.\n\n\"I remember,\" continued the widow, after a pause, \"that Jouret, when he\nheard my husband was a scientist, simulated an interest in science. He\ndid have a smattering knowledge of science, but he was plainly affected,\nso we decided to just let him drop. No ill-feeling. We just--well, we\nwere not interested.\"\n\n\"You do not approve of circus people?\"\n\n\"It is not that. Any honest work is honorable. It seems commendable to\nfurnish amusement for the public. I know little about people of his\nprofession but I am sure they are perfectly all right. It was Jouret,\npersonally. He seemed noisy and insincere. The girl was nice. I loved\nher.\"\n\n\"That is all you know of the Jourets?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Darrow, I wish to go through this house from attic to basement.\nHave you any objections?\"\n\n\"None whatever. Make yourself free, but do not attach any significance\nto what appears to be a secret passageway and cave. My father was a\nbiological chemist. He used to experiment much with small animals. He\nhad a cave where he stored chemicals, and I believe you will find old\nchemicals stored down there now. I disturbed nothing.\"\n\nThe widow forced a smile to her lips. \"Will you excuse me?\" she\nconcluded. \"I am trying to carry on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLees, carrying a flashlight, began a systematic search of the premises.\nHe made his way up a winding staircase, through dust and cobwebs to the\nattic. He found the top story filled with trunks and bits of furniture\nof a previous generation. All was in order, but dust-covered and\ncobwebby.\n\n\"Someone has been here before me,\" he said to himself, brushing a mist\nof cobwebs from his coat sleeves. \"There is a path brushed through the\nspiderwebs.\" Turning his flashlight on the floor, he exclaimed:\n\n\"And here are footprints in the dust. Well I'll be--!\"\n\nThen, after some study, he mused:\n\n\"Of course there has been someone here. The killer of Darrow probably\nhas been here to see what he could see. It was no great task. The doors\nwere never locked. The footprints are of no value except to give me the\nsize of his shoes.\"\n\nHe measured the footprints carefully. Then he went downstairs and phoned\nthe measurements to a local shoe dealer, asking him to give him the\ntrade size of shoes which would make such prints.\n\n\"They are number nines,\" decided the shoe dealer.\n\nLees then returned to resume his search in the rooms and corridors.\n\n\"Wonder if Jouret wears nines,\" he questioned himself. \"But what if he\ndoes? I couldn't convict him on that score. However, it might help.\"\n\nThen he fell to searching through the old trunks. He found old\nphotographs, articles of apparel, knicknacks--grandmother's and\ngrandfather's belongings all of them, and some children's clothes of the\ndays when little boys wore ruffles about their necks and little girls'\npantalettes reached to their ankles.\n\nCarefully each article was replaced. He made his way down to the third\nand then the second floor. Through cobwebby corridors and bedchambers he\nsearched, but found nothing further to aid his case.\n\nIn the unused rooms on the first floor he found an old spinning-wheel,\ncandle moulds and utensils used in cooking in the days when housewives\ncooked over an open fire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe did not find the \"secret\" passageway until Mrs. Darrow came to his\naid. Leading from the basement was a coal chute. This shoot was formed\nin a triangle with the point under a trap. It was man-high at the cellar\nopening and its floor was a slide for fuel. It had been in use,\nevidently, quite recently.\n\nAt the cellar wall of this chute, Mrs. Darrow pressed what appeared to\nbe a knot in the old timber and pushed open a door.\n\nA dank odor issued forth as the door was opened. Lees entered the\npassage and Mrs. Darrow returned upstairs.\n\nFollowing the underground passageway, Lees came onto a cave about 14 by\n14 feet in size with a ceiling and walls of arched brick. It had\nevidently been built before the days of cement construction.\n\nA long bench and shelves with carboys and jars of chemicals were the\nonly furnishings. Lees sounded all the walls, but found nothing further\nto interest him.\n\nLees returned to town at the urgent call of \"Old Perk,\" who had arranged\nwith great care to keep the appointment at 50th street and Broadway,\nwhere the decoy package was to be left. He had snipers in nearby\nwindows. He had detectives, dressed in the gay garb of the habitues of\nthe neighborhood, patrolling the corner, and he and his own guard parked\nan automobile, against all traffic rule, at the curb near the rubbish\ncan.\n\nAn office boy sauntered up to the rubbish can, threw in the decoy\npackage, and sauntered away.\n\nA second later there was a low humming sound. The decoy package fairly\njumped out of the rubbish can and disappeared in thin air.\n\nThe humming sound seemed to round the corner into 50th Street.\nDetectives followed on the jump. The humming approached an auto at the\ncurb and the auto's self starter began to function. As the police stood\nnear by, enough to have jumped into the auto, the whole machine, a big\ntouring car, actually disappeared before their eyes.\n\nConsternation is a mild word when used to describe the result.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll forces set to trap the extortionists gathered in a group, and in\ntheir surprise and disappointment began discussing the queer case in\nloud tones. A crowd was gathering which was blocking traffic.\n\n\"Old Perk\" was the first to recover from his surprise.\n\n\"Get the hell out of this neighborhood,\" he yelled to his working\nforces. \"All of you get down to my office!\"\n\nThe working force dissolved and \"Old Perk\" drove away.\n\nAt \"Old Perk's\" office shortly afterward a conference of the defeated\nforces of the law and of science was held.\n\n\"Old Perk\" stormed and raged and the detective captain in charge fumed\nand fussed, but nothing came of it all. One was as powerless as another.\nFinally the conference adjourned.\n\nThe next morning in the mail, Perkins Ferguson, president of Schefert\nEngineering Corporation, received a letter carefully printed in rubber\ntype. It read:\n\n     Thanks for the $50 bill. You cheated us by $99,950. This will never\n     do. Don't be like that. You poor fools, you make us increase our\n     demand. We double it. Leave $200,000 for us on your desk and leave\n     the desk unlocked. We will get it. Every time you ignore one of our\n     demands, one of your number will die. Better take this matter\n     seriously. Last warning.\n\n     Invisible Death.\n\n\"Not another dime will they get out of me,\" mused Ferguson.\n\nHe started opening the rest of his mail.\n\nA clerk entered and handed him a telegram. It read:\n\n     \"Damon Farnsworth struck down at breakfast table. Family heard\n     humming sound as he fell from his chair. Removed to Medical Center.\n     Skull reported fractured. May die.\n\n     \"William Devins, Chief of Police, Larchmont.\"\n\nFerguson wildly seized the telephone. \"Get me Farnsworth's house at\nLarchmont!\" he shouted to his operator.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe phone was answered by Jones, the butler.\n\n\"This is Ferguson.\"\n\nAn agitated voice replied:\n\n\"'Ow sir, yes sir. It's true, sir. 'E was bleeding at the 'ead, sir.\nSomething 'it 'im.\"\n\n\"Let me talk to Mrs. Farnsworth.\"\n\n\"They are at the 'ospital, sir.\"\n\n\"One of the boys.\"\n\n\"Both are at the 'ospital, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will live?\"\n\n\"An' 'ow could I say, sir?\"\n\nFerguson called the Medical Center. They permitted him to talk to a\ndoctor and a nurse. The nurse referred him to the doctor, who said:\n\n\"He is unconscious. There is a wicked fracture at the base of the brain.\nHe was struck from the back--a club, I believe. He may die without\nregaining consciousness. I am hoping he will rally and that he will be\nall right.\"\n\nFerguson ordered his car and, with Lees at his heels, jumped in the\ntonneau. He heard a humming sound back of him. He looked back and saw\nnothing. Both he and Lees were too impressed for words.\n\n\"Step on it,\" Ferguson ordered the chauffeur. \"Drive us to the Medical\nCenter.\"\n\nAt the world's largest group of hospitals, Ferguson's worst fears were\nconfirmed. The patient was reported sinking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFerguson, giant of Wall Street, was a low spirited man as he drove back\ndown town to his office. With Lees he passed through the outer offices,\nbuzzing with business and the click of typewriters. Not a head was\nraised from a desk or machine. It was a well-drilled force.\n\nInto his private sanctum he walked or rather dragged himself, and\nwearily he sat down. He pushed a pile of papers from him and ran his\nhand over his hot brow.\n\nBlood pounded at his temples.\n\nFor the first time in his life he faced a situation which was too deep\nfor his understanding.\n\nOver and over again he reviewed the uncanny events as Lees sat awaiting\norders.\n\n\"I cannot have them killing off my friends like that,\" he mused finally.\n\nHe called a clerk.\n\n\"Go to the bank and get $200,000 in fifties and one hundreds,\" he\ncommanded.\n\nWhen the clerk returned with the money he laid the package on his desk\nand left the desk open. \"This might appear cowardly, but it will give us\ntime,\" he said. Lees did not offer an opinion.\n\nFerguson drew a personal note for $200,000 and sent it to the Schefert\nCorporation's attorneys. This amount represented a large part of\nFerguson's personal assets, not involved with any company with which he\nwas connected. He told Lees to go about his further investigations. Then\nhe left the office and started for his home. \"I'll bank my life Lees\nwill have those crooks lined up within a week,\" he assured himself as he\nlolled in his auto, bound homeward. But his voice sounded hollow, and\nthe blood still pounded at his temples.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReaching home, he found a call from the western plant, at Chicago. He\nphoned the superintendent with a foreboding that all was not well.\n\n\"This you, Perk?\" sounded the voice on the wire.\n\n\"Yes, what's up?\"\n\n\"I had not intended bothering you with this, but in the light of all\nthat has happened I guess you had better know that one of our engineers\nwent stark mad out here about three weeks ago. He was a very brainy man\nbut his reason snapped. He first appeared queer when he began talking of\nanarchy and cursing capitalists. Then one afternoon he struck a shop\nforeman down with a heavy wrench and rushed out of the plant. We have\nnot seen him since. The police have been looking for him, but he is\nstill at large.\"\n\n\"That explains a lot of things,\" said \"Old Perk.\" \"Tell the police to\nkeep after him. We'll look for him here. File me a complete detailed\nreport of the incident by telegraph,\" he instructed. Then he asked:\n\n\"How is the foreman? Badly hurt?\"\n\n\"He dodged; it was a glancing blow. The foreman was back to work in a\nweek. But he is nervous and has armed himself. We have put on extra\nguards.\"\n\n\"Good,\" commended Ferguson. \"Don't hesitate to spend tolls to keep me\nadvised of any developments.\"\n\nAn hour and a half later, Ferguson phoned the chief clerk in his\noffices:\n\n\"Go into my private office,\" he ordered, \"and see if there is a package\non my desk. It is a bank package.\"\n\nThe clerk returned in a few moments.\n\n\"There is no package on your desk, Mr. Ferguson.\"\n\n\"That is all I wanted to know,\" said Ferguson, and hung up the receiver.\n\nThen Ferguson called up the Darrow home and tried to get in touch with\nLees, but was unable to do so, as Mrs. Darrow said she had not seen him\nsince he had been called back to the office.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe reason Ferguson could not reach Lees was because Lees had decided to\nlearn once and for all if Jouret wore number nine shoes. He had started\nfor Jouret's in his own car. It was a beautiful country he was\ntraversing, but he had no time to note that the tree branches almost met\nover his head and that his way was bordered with a profusion of wild\nflowers, displaying a rainbow of colors.\n\nThe house of Jouret, the retired circus performer, sat back far from the\nroad, against the side of a beautiful hill, and was surrounded by\npoplars. The landscape was wilder and more natural than that of the\nDarrow place adjoining.\n\nThe door was opened by a Porto Rican boy. Lees lost no time. He said\nbluntly:\n\n\"Tell your master that a gentleman is here to see him on very particular\nbusiness.\"\n\nJouret, himself, came back with the boy.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, smiling a welcome.\n\n\"I am working on the case of the death of Mr. Darrow, your neighbor. I\nbelieved you might have seen something. I thought you might aid me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJouret betrayed no surprise.\n\n\"Come in,\" he said. He led the way to a large reception room and asked\nhis visitor to be seated. He was the soul of affability. Short, husky\nand florid. His eyes large, black and staring. His hair black, quite\nlong and curling upward at the ears. He was dressed in black, and he had\nthe appearance of a big, fat crow.\n\n\"I am glad you came,\" he greeted his guest, \"for I have far too few\ncallers.\" He switched on a big electric bunch-light in the center of the\nroom, for it was dusk.\n\n\"We have been told that you are a retired circus man,\" said Lees, in his\nusual frank manner.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Jouret. \"I traveled on the continent, finally\njourneying to Australia and then to the States. I crossed the country\nfrom San Francisco and settled down here. I was known as 'Elias, the\nGreat.' I had my own company and property. It was a magic show. It was\nnot a circus, although we did carry two elephants, three camels, some\nponies, snakes, and birds and smaller animals. That's where the circus\nreport came from.\n\n\"When I retired I sold my stock to a circus. The newspapers regarded it\nas funny, and one of them printed a half page story with pictures about\nthe public sale. It was very much exaggerated. They mentioned giraffes,\nhyenas, and a lot of other animals I never possessed. Odd, wasn't it,\ngetting so much publicity after I was through needing it? However I\nnever, in those days, dodged the limelight.\" Jouret ended his speech\nwith a loud and hearty guffaw.\n\n\"I will call my daughter,\" Jouret appended. \"She will be glad to meet\nyou.\" He left the room.\n\nLees had taken occasion to note the size of Jouret's feet. They were\nsmall, almost effeminate. More likely fives or sixes than nines.\n\nSoon Jouret returned with a girl in her early twenties. She was blond\nand radiantly beautiful.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoris Jouret bowed and smiled in a perfectly friendly manner. Lees noted\nthat there was something about her eyes that made her appear dazed.\n\nJouret monopolized the conversation, giving no one a chance to edge in a\nword.\n\n\"This gentleman desires information in connection with the death of our\nneighbor Mr., or is it Dr., Darrow? I want you to assure him, as I will,\nthat we have seen or noted nothing that could possibly throw light on\nthe strange case.\"\n\nThe girl nodded, it seemed a little wearily, and Jouret was off on\nanother conversational flight:\n\n\"I too am a man of scientific attainments,\" he chattered. \"I am a\nbiologist, toxicologist, doctor of medicine, a geologist, metalurgist,\nmineralogist, and somewhat of a mechanic and electrician. I have given\nlong hours to the study of strange sciences in meta-physics, to which\nyou men give too little attention. There are sciences which transcend\nany of this sphere. There is a higher astronomy. I neglected to say that\nI am an astronomer.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" drawled Lees.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Jouret emphatically.\n\nThe girl had adopted rather a theatrical pose, which disclosed\nconsiderable of her nether charms, and said nothing at all.\n\n\"When you find your man,\" volunteered Jouret, \"you will find a madman.\"\nHe said this ponderously and with a gesture meant evidently to be\nimpressive.\n\n\"You believe a madman did it?\" asked Lees, as Jouret paused, expecting a\nquestion.\n\n\"Undoubtedly. It was a paranoic with delusions of money, grandeur and a\nstrongly developed homicidal mania. To me, that is the only sensible\nsolution. I am quite sure that I am correct.\"\n\nLees arose to go and Jouret did not urge him to stay. He bowed Lees out\nand Doris bowed with him.\n\n\"She is a beautiful girl,\" mused Lees once he was outside.\n\nLees ran over in his mind the circumstances of his visit to Jouret.\nThere was no doubt in his mind that Jouret's shoes were too small to be\nnumber nines, and he reasoned that that fact might tend to eliminate\nJouret. But he was not satisfied.\n\n\"I am going to get some gas,\" he told himself, \"and then I am going to\nget two private detectives to assist me, for I'm going right back there.\nFor the first time in my life I am going to be a Peeping Tom.\n\n\"There is no moon. The poplars will give us a view of all three floors\nof that house, if they leave their blinds up enough, and three of us can\nwatch all three floors at once.\"\n\nHe phoned Ferguson that he might be busy for days, joined his pair of\noperatives from the detective agency and for some time the three\noperated on a well conceived plan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was probably a week later that Lees rendered a report to Perkins\nFerguson, which for a time proved one of the strangest documents in the\nweird case. It read:\n\n\"You will probably think I am crazy, and for this reason I am having\nthis report subscribed and sworn to, jointly and severally. With my two\ndetectives I have seen Miss Jouret, the girl I told you about over the\nphone, in three places at one and the same time. Not once but twice this\nhas happened.\n\n\"Looking through the windows of the Jouret place at night, we saw the\ngirl on the first, second and third floor of the house. We believed this\ndue to a clever arrangement of mirrors. But figure this out:\n\n\"The next day she drove a car to town. We followed. She got out at one\ntheater and entered. She did not come back, that we could see, but the\ncar drove off. There was no chauffeur, and we thought we had discovered\nthe driverless auto, until we looked and saw Miss Jouret still at the\nwheel.\n\n\"She got out and entered another theater. She did not come back, but the\ncar drove off with her still at the wheel. She entered a third theater\nafter parking the car and this time the driver's seat and the tonneau\nwas empty.\n\n\"Reverse the reel and you will see her coming out of three theaters and\ndriving home. That is what happened. There must be three of her, all\nidentical, but only one shows at a time. If it's some of Jouret's\nfar-famed magic, I'll say he's some conjurer. The explanation is not yet\nforthcoming. We want to shadow Jouret, but he never goes anywhere. The\ngirl has only been out the one time when she attended three matinees as\ndescribed. Believe it or not.\n\n\"The next night we each--the two detectives and I--tried to steal a\nmarch on one another and called her up and asked her to go out. To our\nindividual surprise, she agreed in each case. To our collective\nsurprise, she kept all three dates on the same night. She walked\nthrough the trees in this vicinity with me. She also drove down the road\nin the auto with one of my detectives, and she went dancing with the\nother. She was in three places miles apart at one and the same time.\n\n\"We each brought her home within a half hour of the other and we are\nswearing to that. Either we are all hypnotized or else there are three\nidentical Misses Jouret.\n\n\"Jouret himself treats us all wonderfully, gives us the run of the\nhouse, and tries to talk us to death.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe strange document was subscribed by Lees and the two detectives and\nwas held by Ferguson pending developments.\n\nThe next report from Lees read:\n\n\"I had a chance to prowl around the Jouret house a little while waiting\nfor Miss Jouret to dress. I met her twice in my ramblings and a few\nminutes later she met me again, this time in a different costume.\n\n\"I got a chance to search the woods back of Jouret's house in the\nevening. I found a spot where the earth had been disturbed, and dug up a\npair of shoes. They were number nines.\"\n\nA fourth report from him read:\n\n\"We found the body of the crazed engineer. He had drowned himself in a\nlake. This eliminates him as a murder suspect.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo weeks passed with no new developments in the \"Invisible Death\" case\nexcept for the arrival of a letter demanding $1,000,000 and threatening\nthe life of Perkins Ferguson if the demand was ignored. It was ignored,\nand only served to spur Lees and his detectives on to decisive action.\n\nThey decided to rush the Jouret house and kidnap Jouret with the idea of\nholding him until he agreed to explain the presence of the number nine\nshoes buried back of his house.\n\nA low moon hung over the poplars when Lees rang the Jouret front door\nbell. One detective was guarding a side door and the other a back door.\n\nSuddenly Jouret was seen to jump from a second-story window. As he did,\na car driven by one of his Porto Ricans came along the drive and he\nleaped into it. Lees, first to see Jouret, called his detectives. They\ncame running. Their car was waiting in the road.\n\nThe Porto Rican was seen to jump from the Jouret car just as it started\nsouth towards New York.\n\nLees took up the race. Both cars had plenty of power, but the Jouret car\nsuddenly disappeared as a low humming noise began to break the stillness\nof the night.\n\nOne of the detectives was at the wheel. Lees, as usual, was giving\norders:\n\n\"Keep close to that hum. Never mind that you cannot _see_ the car. It is\nthere all right. If you can gain on it enough, drive right into it.\"\n\n\"Righto!\" shouted the detective. \"We're wise to him now.\"\n\nThe humming noise was taking on speed with every second. So was Lees'\ncar. Soon Lees' car was making sixty miles an hour with the hum just\nahead and barely audible.\n\nPast traffic lights, over bridges and grade crossings the mad chase of\nthe phantom continued.\n\nWildly racing through the night, missing other cars by a breath, the\nbig, visible auto continued its pursuit of--what?\n\nCareening, Lees' car rounded a curve, and, above the hum just ahead,\nthey heard the shouted curses of their quarry. But he could not be seen.\nLees could only see the road marked by his lights.\n\nMile after mile the wild, uncanny chase of the phantom continued.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoon the lights of New York could be seen in the distance. The cars were\nforced to slow down somewhat. Suddenly there was a thundering crash\nahead. A car was twisted in a mass of tangled wreckage.\n\nFeminine and masculine shrieks blended as Lees' car piled up on the\nwrecked heap. A third car, becoming suddenly visible, rolled over and\nbrought up at the edge of the road. From this car emerged the limping,\ncursing form of Jouret.\n\nFrom the wreckage three painfully injured young men dragged and tore\nthemselves. Then they leaped--ignoring their hurts--at the limping\nfigure.\n\nThe fight was on. Jouret was heavy and powerful and proved an obstinate\nfighter, for he knew he was fighting for his life. He bit and clawed. He\nkicked with one uninjured leg and butted with his massive head.\n\nLees and his detectives were fighting with no respect for the rules.\nLees managed to get his two hands on the bull-neck of Jouret just as one\ndetective connected a duet of blows to the man's wind.\n\nLees' hands closed in a steely grip, and soon Jouret was limp and\nhelpless.\n\nThey held him there. An ambulance arrived. A few minutes later a police\nauto with reserves came on the scene. The police shackled Jouret.\n\nThe car that had been hit by the phantom was a light sedan. It was\noccupied by two women. Their bodies were drawn from the wreckage. Both\nwere dead--innocents sacrificed to the blood madness of a maniac.\n\nJouret was right about himself. He was a paranoic with a strongly\ndeveloped homicidal mania.\n\nIn the wreckage was found a package containing $200,000 and also two\ntwisted and broken mechanisms. One of these was about the size of an\nordinary kitchen coffee-mill, and the other slightly larger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRegarding these machines, Lees wrote in a report:\n\n\"While making a fourth search of Darrow's laboratory, I found the\nequations, specifications and what I believe to be the full plans for\nthe last invention of the ingenious Darius Darrow.\n\n\"Many of the most astounding inventions and discoveries have resulted\nfrom theories which were laughed to scorn at the time they were\nadvanced. Roebling's plans for the Brooklyn Bridge resulted in a meeting\nof the foremost engineers of the day. All agreed that the plans were\nbuilt on a false premise. They argued that the bridge would fall of its\nown weight. Then they all had a good laugh. The bridge still stands.\n\n\"Watching smoke float over a hill from army camp fires caused an early\nFrench scientist to dream of filling a bag full of smoke and riding with\nit over the hill. The first balloon was the answer to this dream.\n\n\"James Watt is said to have gotten his idea for a steam engine from\nwatching a lid on a tea-kettle dance under steam pressure.\n\n\"When Langley was flying his man-carrying kites the Wright brothers\ndreamed of hitching an engine and a propeller to a giant kite. The\nairplane was the result of these experiments.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Darrow got his idea from watching a rapidly revolving wheel. He noticed\nthat the spokes and rim blended into a blurred disc when a certain speed\nwas reached. The entire wheel was practically invisible, under certain\nlighting conditions, when a higher speed was attained.\n\n\"Darrow went further and reached the conclusion that there was a rate of\nvibration that would produce invisibility. This was accepted in\npractically all engineering research plants, long before it was\nperfected by Darrow.\n\n\"The facts are that any rapidly vibrating object becomes more and more\ndifficult to outline as its rate of vibration increases. All that was\nleft for Darrow was to arrive at the exact mathematical time, tone, or\nrate of vibration producing invisibility and to construct a vibrator\ntuned to produce this condition.\n\n\"His first machine produced the vibrations of invisibility in a field\nwith a three-foot radius in all directions. That is, it caused every\nsolid object, within this atmospheric field, to vibrate at the rate,\ntone, or speed of invisibility. This machine was in no sense rotary. It\ndeparted from the original example of a revolving wheel and entered\ninstead into general vibration in a given or measured field.\n\n\"The pulsations or vibrations of an ordinary automobile engine will\ncause every ounce of metal, or solid, in the automobile--including the\ndriver--to vibrate at the same rate or momentum. This is a known fact,\nand it provided the basis for Darrow's experiments.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Darrow built two machines. The first had a field with a radius of three\nfeet on all sides. This was used by the killer in his murders. Jouret\nstole this machine first, thus paving his way for the second robbery.\n\n\"With the first machine in his possession, Jouret was able to commit the\nDarrow murder without being seen. He had to have the second and larger\nmachine, however, to make his auto disappear. He stole the larger\nmachine at the time of the Darrow murder, and with it he had his auto\nvanish, as the gardener testified.\n\n\"Both machines were hopelessly smashed in the wreck, but with Darrow's\ndocuments at hand, we might be able to construct another and a larger\nmodel. A machine built on the proper scale will make a plane or a\nbattleship invisible and should, as Darrow said, make war against this\ncountry impossible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Digging into Jouret's history we found that the 'Misses Jouret' were\none-cell triplets. Their mother, Mrs. Doris Nettleton, an English woman,\nwas a member of Jouret's troupe, as was the father.\n\n\"The mother died at the birth of the triplets. The father died a few\nyears later. The company was touring Australia at the time. Jouret and\nthe father had the birth of only one baby recorded. She was named Doris,\nafter the mother. The other girls also used this one name. They now have\nonly one name among them until the court gives them individual names.\n\n\"Jouret never let but one girl be seen at a time. The reason was that he\nand the father had planned to use the girls, when grown, to create a\nsurprising stage illusion. In this illusion, one girl was to act as the\nearthly body and the other girls as the astral bodies of the same\npurported individual.\n\n\"The father died, and Jouret retired before he ever got around to\nstaging the illusion. Jouret continued the deception, however, because\nit appealed to his showman's nature.\n\n\"The girls, at all times, were under the hypnotic control of Jouret,\nand, of course, knew nothing of his crazed intellect or crimes. Upon his\narrest Jouret released the girls from the spell of years.\n\n\"The Misses Nettleton say that Jouret was always kind to them and was an\nethical showman until his mind gave way.\n\n\"I told the triplets that I might find them employment with our concern,\nbut they prefer to follow in the footsteps of their mother and father,\nand return to the stage.\"\n\nFerguson, quite his normal self once more, since Farnsworth was\nrecovering slowly, twitted Lees about being in love with one of the\ntriplets. Lees admitted they were most gorgeous blondes, but insisted he\npreferred one brunette.\n\n\"Then another thing,\" added Lees. \"Any man who falls in love with one of\nthe Nettleton triplets will never be sure just which one he fell in love\nwith.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Astounding Stories of Super-Science\nJanuary 1930, by Various.\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ASTOUNDING STORIES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 41481-8.txt or 41481-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/1/4/8/41481/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
