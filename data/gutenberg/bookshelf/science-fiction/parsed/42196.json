He was a wiry, sun-burnt man with a straggling black beard, and\nhis ragged garments proclaimed him a nomad. He looked smaller and meaner\nthan ever in contrast to the giant Cimmerian with his black brows, broad\nchest, and powerful limbs. They stood in a corner of the Sword-Makers'\nBazar, and on either side of them flowed past the many-tongued,\nmany-colored stream of the Zamboula streets, which is exotic, hybrid,\nflamboyant and clamorous.\n\nConan pulled his eyes back from following a bold-eyed, red-lipped\nGhanara whose short skirt bared her brown thigh at each insolent step,\nand frowned down at his importunate companion.\n\n'What do you mean by peril?' he demanded.\n\nThe desert man glanced furtively over his shoulder before replying, and\nlowered his voice.\n\n'Who can say? But desert men and travelers _have_ slept in the house of\nAram Baksh, and never been seen or heard of again. What became of them?\n_He_ swore they rose and went their way--and it is true that no citizen\nof the city has ever disappeared from his house. But no one saw the\ntravelers again, and men say that goods and equipment recognized as\ntheirs have been seen in the bazars. If Aram did not sell them, after\ndoing away with their owners, how came they here?'\n\n'I have no goods,' growled the Cimmerian, touching the shagreen-bound\nhilt of the broadsword that hung at his hip. 'I have even sold my\nhorse.'\n\n'But it is not always rich strangers who vanish by night from the house\nof Aram Baksh!' chattered the Zuagir. 'Nay, poor desert men have slept\nthere--because his score is less than that of the other taverns--and\nhave been seen no more. Once a chief of the Zuagirs whose son had thus\nvanished complained to the satrap, Jungir Khan, who ordered the house\nsearched by soldiers.'\n\n'And they found a cellar full of corpses?' asked Conan in good-humored\nderision.\n\n'Nay! They found naught! And drove the chief from the city with threats\nand curses! But--' he drew closer to Conan and shivered--'something else\nwas found! At the edge of the desert, beyond the houses, there is a\nclump of palm trees, and within that grove there is a pit. And within\nthat pit have been found human bones, charred and blackened! Not once,\nbut many times!'\n\n'Which proves what?' grunted the Cimmerian.\n\n'Aram Baksh is a demon! Nay, in this accursed city which Stygians built\nand which Hyrkanians rule--where white, brown and black folk mingle\ntogether to produce hybrids of all unholy hues and breeds--who can tell\nwho is a man, and who a demon in disguise? Aram Baksh is a demon in the\nform of a man! At night he assumes his true guise and carries his guests\noff into the desert where his fellow demons from the waste meet in\nconclave.'\n\n'Why does he always carry off strangers?' asked Conan skeptically.\n\n'The people of the city would not suffer him to slay their people, but\nthey care naught for the strangers who fall into his hands. Conan, you\nare of the West, and know not the secrets of this ancient land. But,\nsince the beginning of happenings, the demons of the desert have\nworshipped Yog, the Lord of the Empty Abodes, with fire--fire that\ndevours human victims.\n\n'Be warned! You have dwelt for many moons in the tents of the Zuagirs,\nand you are our brother! Go not to the house of Aram Baksh!'\n\n'Get out of sight!' Conan said suddenly. 'Yonder comes a squad of the\ncity-watch. If they see you they may remember a horse that was stolen\nfrom the satrap's stable--'\n\nThe Zuagir gasped, and moved convulsively. He ducked between a booth and\na stone horse-trough, pausing only long enough to chatter: 'Be warned,\nmy brother! There are demons in the house of Aram Baksh!' Then he darted\ndown a narrow alley and was gone.\n\nConan shifted his broad sword-belt to his liking, and calmly returned\nthe searching stares directed at him by the squad of watchmen as they\nswung past. They eyed him curiously and suspiciously, for he was a man\nwho stood out even in such a motley throng as crowded the winding\nstreets of Zamboula. His blue eyes and alien features distinguished him\nfrom the Eastern swarms, and the straight sword at his hip added point\nto the racial difference.\n\nThe watchmen did not accost him, but swung on down the street, while the\ncrowd opened a lane for them. They were Pelishtim, squat, hook-nosed,\nwith blue-black beards sweeping their mailed breasts--mercenaries hired\nfor work the ruling Turanians considered beneath themselves, and no less\nhated by the mongrel population for that reason.\n\nConan glanced at the sun, just beginning to dip behind the flat-topped\nhouses on the western side of the bazar, and hitching once more at his\nbelt, moved off in the direction of Aram Baksh's tavern.\n\nWith a hillman's stride he moved through the ever-shifting colors of the\nstreets, where the ragged tunics of whining beggars brushed against the\nermine-trimmed khalats of lordly merchants, and the pearl-sewn satin of\nrich courtezans. Giant black slaves slouched along, jostling\nblue-bearded wanderers from the Shemitish cities, ragged nomads from the\nsurrounding deserts, traders and adventurers from all the lands of the\nEast.\n\nThe native population was no less heterogenous. Here, centuries ago,\nthe armies of Stygia had come, carving an empire out of the eastern\ndesert. Zamboula was but a small trading-town then, lying amidst a ring\nof oases, and inhabited by descendants of nomads. The Stygians built it\ninto a city and settled it with their own people, and with Shemite and\nKushite slaves. The ceaseless caravans, threading the desert from east\nto west and back again, brought riches and more mingling of races. Then\ncame the conquering Turanians, riding out of the East to thrust back the\nboundaries of Stygia, and now for a generation Zamboula had been Turan's\nwesternmost outpost, ruled by a Turanian satrap.\n\nThe babel of a myriad tongues smote on the Cimmerian's ears as the\nrestless pattern of the Zamboula streets weaved about him--cleft now and\nthen by a squad of clattering horsemen, the tall, supple warriors of\nTuran, with dark hawk-faces, clinking metal and curved swords. The\nthrong scampered from under their horses' hoofs, for they were the lords\nof Zamboula. But tall, somber Stygians, standing back in the shadows,\nglowered darkly, remembering their ancient glories. The hybrid\npopulation cared little whether the king who controlled their destinies\ndwelt in dark Khemi or gleaming Aghrapur. Jungir Khan ruled Zamboula,\nand men whispered that Nafertari, the satrap's mistress, ruled Jungir\nKhan; but the people went their way, flaunting their myriad colors in\nthe streets, bargaining, disputing, gambling, swilling, loving, as the\npeople of Zamboula have done for all the centuries its towers and\nminarets have lifted over the sands of the Kharamun.\n\nBronze lanterns, carved with leering dragons, had been lighted in the\nstreets before Conan reached the house of Aram Baksh. The tavern was the\nlast occupied house on the street, which ran west. A wide garden,\nenclosed by a wall, where date-palms grew thick, separated it from the\nhouses farther east. To the west of the inn stood another grove of\npalms, through which the street, now become a road, wound out into the\ndesert. Across the road from the tavern stood a row of deserted huts,\nshaded by straggling palm trees, and occupied only by bats and jackals.\nAs Conan came down the road he wondered why the beggars, so plentiful in\nZamboula, had not appropriated these empty houses for sleeping quarters.\nThe lights ceased some distance behind him. Here were no lanterns,\nexcept the one hanging before the tavern gate: only the stars, the soft\ndust of the road underfoot, and the rustle of the palm leaves in the\ndesert breeze.\n\nAram's gate did not open upon the road, but upon the alley which ran\nbetween the tavern and the garden of the date-palms. Conan jerked\nlustily at the rope which depended from the bell beside the lantern,\naugmenting its clamor by hammering on the iron-bound teakwork gate with\nthe hilt of his sword. A wicket opened in the gate and a black face\npeered through.\n\n'Open, blast you,' requested Conan. 'I'm a guest. I've paid Aram for a\nroom, and a room I'll have, by Crom!'\n\nThe black craned his neck to stare into the starlit road behind Conan;\nbut he opened the gate without comment, and closed it again behind the\nCimmerian, locking and bolting it. The wall was unusually high; but\nthere were many thieves in Zamboula, and a house on the edge of the\ndesert might have to be defended against a nocturnal nomad raid. Conan\nstrode through a garden where great pale blossoms nodded in the\nstarlight, and entered the tap-room, where a Stygian with the shaven\nhead of a student sat at a table brooding over nameless mysteries, and\nsome nondescripts wrangled over a game of dice in a corner.\n\nAram Baksh came forward, walking softly, a portly man, with a black\nbeard that swept his breast, a jutting hook-nose, and small black eyes\nwhich were never still.\n\n'You wish food?' he asked. 'Drink?'\n\n'I ate a joint of beef and a loaf of bread in the _suk_,' grunted Conan.\n'Bring me a tankard of Ghazan wine--I've got just enough left to pay for\nit.' He tossed a copper coin on the wine-splashed board.\n\n'You did not win at the gaming-tables?'\n\n'How could I, with only a handful of silver to begin with? I paid you\nfor the room this morning, because I knew I'd probably lose. I wanted to\nbe sure I had a roof over my head tonight. I notice nobody sleeps in the\nstreets in Zamboula. The very beggars hunt a niche they can barricade\nbefore dark. The city must be full of a particularly blood-thirsty brand\nof thieves.'\n\nHe gulped the cheap wine with relish, and then followed Aram out of the\ntap-room. Behind him the players halted their game to stare after him\nwith a cryptic speculation in their eyes. They said nothing, but the\nStygian laughed, a ghastly laugh of inhuman cynicism and mockery. The\nothers lowered their eyes uneasily, avoiding one another's glance. The\narts studied by a Stygian scholar are not calculated to make him share\nthe feelings of a normal human being.\n\nConan followed Aram down a corridor lighted by copper lamps, and it did\nnot please him to note his host's noiseless tread. Aram's feet were clad\nin soft slippers and the hallway was carpeted with thick Turanian rugs;\nbut there was an unpleasant suggestion of stealthiness about the\nZamboulan.\n\nAt the end of the winding corridor Aram halted at a door, across which a\nheavy iron bar rested in powerful metal brackets. This Aram lifted and\nshowed the Cimmerian into a well-appointed chamber, the windows of\nwhich, Conan instantly noted, were small and strongly set with twisted\nbars of iron, tastefully gilded. There were rugs on the floor, a couch,\nafter the Eastern fashion, and ornately carved stools. It was a much\nmore elaborate chamber than Conan could have procured for the price\nnearer the center of the city--a fact that had first attracted him,\nwhen, that morning, he discovered how slim a purse his roisterings for\nthe past few days had left him. He had ridden into Zamboula from the\ndesert a week before.\n\nAram had lighted a bronze lamp, and he now called Conan's attention to\nthe two doors. Both were provided with heavy bolts.\n\n'You may sleep safely tonight, Cimmerian,' said Aram, blinking over his\nbushy beard from the inner doorway.\n\nConan grunted and tossed his naked broadsword on the couch.\n\n'Your bolts and bars are strong; but I always sleep with steel by my\nside.'\n\nAram made no reply; he stood fingering his thick beard for a moment as\nhe stared at the grim weapon. Then silently he withdrew, closing the\ndoor behind him. Conan shot the bolt into place, crossed the room,\nopened the opposite door and looked out. The room was on the side of the\nhouse that faced the road running west from the city. The door opened\ninto a small court that was enclosed by a wall of its own. The\nend-walls, which shut it off from the rest of the tavern compound, were\nhigh and without entrances; but the wall that flanked the road was low,\nand there was no lock on the gate.\n\nConan stood for a moment in the door, the glow of the bronze lamp behind\nhim, looking down the road to where it vanished among the dense palms.\nTheir leaves rustled together in the faint breeze; beyond them lay the\nnaked desert. Far up the street, in the other direction, lights gleamed\nand the noises of the city came faintly to him. Here was only starlight,\nthe whispering of the palm leaves, and beyond that low wall, the dust of\nthe road and the deserted huts thrusting their flat roofs against the\nlow stars. Somewhere beyond the palm groves a drum began.\n\nThe garbled warnings of the Zuagir returned to him, seeming somehow less\nfantastic than they had seemed in the crowded, sunlit streets. He\nwondered again at the riddle of those empty huts. Why did the beggars\nshun them? He turned back into the chamber, shut the door and bolted it.\n\nThe light began to flicker, and he investigated, swearing when he found\nthe palm oil in the lamp was almost exhausted. He started to shout for\nAram, then shrugged his shoulders and blew out the light. In the soft\ndarkness he stretched himself fully clad on the couch, his sinewy hand\nby instinct searching for and closing on the hilt of his broadsword.\nGlancing idly at the stars framed in the barred windows, with the murmur\nof the breeze through the palms in his ears, he sank into slumber with a\nvague consciousness of the muttering drum, out on the desert--the low\nrumble and mutter of a leather-covered drum, beaten with soft, rhythmic\nstrokes of an open black hand....\n\n\n\n\n2 The Night Skulkers\n\n\nIt was the stealthy opening of a door which awakened the Cimmerian. He\ndid not awake as civilized men do, drowsy and drugged and stupid. He\nawoke instantly, with a clear mind, recognizing the sound that had\ninterrupted his sleep. Lying there tensely in the dark he saw the outer\ndoor slowly open. In a widening crack of starlit sky he saw framed a\ngreat black bulk, broad, stooping shoulders and a misshapen head blocked\nout against the stars.\n\nConan felt the skin crawl between his shoulders. He had bolted that door\nsecurely. How could it be opening now, save by supernatural agency? And\nhow could a human being possess a head like that outlined against the\nstars? All the tales he had heard in the Zuagir tents of devils and\ngoblins came back to bead his flesh with clammy sweat. Now the monster\nslid noiselessly into the room, with a crouching posture and a shambling\ngait; and a familiar scent assailed the Cimmerian's nostrils, but did\nnot reassure him, since Zuagir legendry represented demons as smelling\nlike that.\n\nNoiselessly Conan coiled his long legs under him; his naked sword was in\nhis right hand, and when he struck it was as suddenly and murderously as\na tiger lunging out of the dark. Not even a demon could have avoided\nthat catapulting charge. His sword met and clove through flesh and bone,\nand something went heavily to the floor with a strangling cry. Conan\ncrouched in the dark above it, sword dripping in his hand. Devil or\nbeast or man, the thing was dead there on the floor. He sensed death as\nany wild thing senses it. He glared through the half-open door into the\nstarlit court beyond. The gate stood open, but the court was empty.\n\nConan shut the door but did not bolt it. Groping in the darkness he\nfound the lamp and lighted it. There was enough oil in it to burn for a\nminute or so. An instant later he was bending over the figure that\nsprawled on the floor in a pool of blood.\n\nIt was a gigantic black man, naked but for a loin-cloth. One hand still\ngrasped a knotty-headed bludgeon. The fellow's kinky wool was built up\ninto horn-like spindles with twigs and dried mud. This barbaric coiffure\nhad given the head its misshapen appearance in the starlight. Provided\nwith a clue to the riddle, Conan pushed back the thick red lips, and\ngrunted as he stared down at teeth filed to points.\n\nHe understood now the mystery of the strangers who had disappeared from\nthe house of Aram Baksh; the riddle of the black drum thrumming out\nthere beyond the palm groves, and of that pit of charred bones--that pit\nwhere strange meat might be roasted under the stars, while black beasts\nsquatted about to glut a hideous hunger. The man on the floor was a\ncannibal slave from Darfar.\n\nThere were many of his kind in the city. Cannibalism was not tolerated\nopenly in Zamboula. But Conan knew now why people locked themselves in\nso securely at night, and why even beggars shunned the open alleys and\ndoorless ruins. He grunted in disgust as he visualized brutish black\nshadows skulking up and down the nighted streets, seeking human\nprey--and such men as Aram Baksh to open the doors to them. The\ninnkeeper was not a demon; he was worse. The slaves from Darfar were\nnotorious thieves; there was no doubt that some of their pilfered loot\nfound its way into the hands of Aram Baksh. And in return he sold them\nhuman flesh.\n\nConan blew out the light, stepped to the door and opened it, and ran his\nhand over the ornaments on the outer side. One of them was movable and\nworked the bolt inside. The room was a trap to catch human prey like\nrabbits. But this time instead of a rabbit it had caught a saber-toothed\ntiger.\n\nConan returned to the other door, lifted the bolt and pressed against\nit. It was immovable and he remembered the bolt on the other side. Aram\nwas taking no chances either with his victims or the men with whom he\ndealt. Buckling on his sword-belt, the Cimmerian strode out into the\ncourt, closing the door behind him. He had no intention of delaying the\nsettlement of his reckoning with Aram Baksh. He wondered how many poor\ndevils had been bludgeoned in their sleep and dragged out of that room\nand down the road that ran through the shadowed palm groves to the\nroasting-pit.\n\nHe halted in the court. The drum was still muttering, and he caught the\nreflection of a leaping red glare through the groves. Cannibalism was\nmore than a perverted appetite with the black men of Darfar; it was an\nintegral element of their ghastly cult. The black vultures were already\nin conclave. But whatever flesh filled their bellies that night, it\nwould not be his.\n\nTo reach Aram Baksh he must climb one of the walls which separated the\nsmall enclosure from the main compound. They were high, meant to keep\nout the man-eaters; but Conan was no swamp-bred black man; his thews had\nbeen steeled in boyhood on the sheer cliffs of his native hills. He was\nstanding at the foot of the nearer wall when a cry echoed under the\ntrees.\n\nIn an instant Conan was crouching at the gate, glaring down the road.\nThe sound had come from the shadows of the huts across the road. He\nheard a frantic choking and gurgling such as might result from a\ndesperate attempt to shriek, with a black hand fastened over the\nvictim's mouth. A close-knit clump of figures emerged from the shadows\nbeyond the huts, and started down the road--three huge black men\ncarrying a slender, struggling figure between them. Conan caught the\nglimmer of pale limbs writhing in the starlight, even as, with a\nconvulsive wrench, the captive slipped from the grasp of the brutal\nfingers and came flying up the road, a supple young woman, naked as the\nday she was born. Conan saw her plainly before she ran out of the road\nand into the shadows between the huts. The blacks were at her heels, and\nback in the shadows the figures merged and an intolerable scream of\nanguish and horror rang out.\n\nStirred to red rage by the ghoulishness of the episode, Conan raced\nacross the road.\n\nNeither victim nor abductors were aware of his presence until the soft\nswish of the dust about his feet brought them about, and then he was\nalmost upon them, coming with the gusty fury of a hill wind. Two of the\nblacks turned to meet him, lifting their bludgeons. But they failed to\nestimate properly the speed at which he was coming. One of them was\ndown, disemboweled, before he could strike, and wheeling cat-like, Conan\nevaded the stroke of the other's cudgel and lashed in a whistling\ncounter-cut. The black's head flew into the air; the headless body took\nthree staggering steps, spurting blood and clawing horribly at the air\nwith groping hands, and then slumped to the dust.\n\nThe remaining cannibal gave back with a strangled yell, hurling his\ncaptive from him. She tripped and rolled in the dust, and the black fled\nin blind panic toward the city. Conan was at his heels. Fear winged the\nblack feet, but before they reached the easternmost hut, he sensed death\nat his back, and bellowed like an ox in the slaughter-yards.\n\n'Black dog of hell!' Conan drove his sword between the dusky shoulders\nwith such vengeful fury that the broad blade stood out half its length\nfrom the black breast. With a choking cry the black stumbled headlong,\nand Conan braced his feet and dragged out his sword as his victim fell.\n\nOnly the breeze disturbed the leaves. Conan shook his head as a lion\nshakes its mane and growled his unsatiated blood-lust. But no more\nshapes slunk from the shadows, and before the huts the starlit road\nstretched empty. He whirled at the quick patter of feet behind him, but\nit was only the girl, rushing to throw herself on him and clasp his neck\nin a desperate grasp, frantic from terror of the abominable fate she had\njust escaped.\n\n'Easy, girl,' he grunted. 'You're all right. How did they catch you?'\n\nShe sobbed something unintelligible. He forgot all about Aram Baksh as\nhe scrutinized her by the light of the stars. She was white, though a\nvery definite brunette, obviously one of Zamboula's many mixed breeds.\nShe was tall, with a slender, supple form, as he was in a good position\nto observe. Admiration burned in his fierce eyes as he looked down on\nher splendid bosom and her lithe limbs, which still quivered from fright\nand exertion. He passed an arm around her flexible waist and said,\nreassuringly: 'Stop shaking, wench; you're safe enough.'\n\nHis touch seemed to restore her shaken sanity. She tossed back her\nthick, glossy locks and cast a fearful glance over her shoulder, while\nshe pressed closer to the Cimmerian as if seeking security in the\ncontact.\n\n'They caught me in the streets,' she muttered, shuddering. 'Lying in\nwait, beneath a dark arch--black men, like great, hulking apes! Set have\nmercy on me! I shall dream of it!'\n\n'What were you doing out on the streets this time of night?' he\ninquired, fascinated by the satiny feel of her sleek skin under his\nquesting fingers.\n\nShe raked back her hair and stared blankly up into his face. She did not\nseem aware of his caresses.\n\n'My lover,' she said. 'My lover drove me into the streets. He went mad\nand tried to kill me. As I fled from him I was seized by those beasts.'\n\n'Beauty like yours might drive a man mad,' quoth Conan, running his\nfingers experimentally through her glossy tresses.\n\nShe shook her head, like one emerging from a daze. She no longer\ntrembled, and her voice was steady.\n\n'It was the spite of a priest--of Totrasmek, the high priest of Hanuman,\nwho desires me for himself--the dog!'\n\n'No need to curse him for that,' grinned Conan. 'The old hyena has\nbetter taste than I thought.'\n\nShe ignored the bluff compliment. She was regaining her poise swiftly.\n\n'My lover is a--a young Turanian soldier. To spite me, Totrasmek gave\nhim a drug that drove him mad. Tonight he snatched up a sword and came\nat me to slay me in his madness, but I fled from him into the streets.\nThe negroes seized me and brought me to this--_what was that?_'\n\nConan had already moved. Soundlessly as a shadow he drew her behind the\nnearest hut, beneath the straggling palms. They stood in tense\nstillness, while the low mutterings both had heard grew louder until\nvoices were distinguishable. A group of negroes, some nine or ten, were\ncoming along the road from the direction of the city. The girl clutched\nConan's arm and he felt the terrified quivering of her supple body\nagainst his.\n\nNow they could understand the gutturals of the black men.\n\n'Our brothers have already assembled at the pit,' said one. 'We have had\nno luck. I hope they have enough for us.'\n\n'Aram promised us a man,' muttered another, and Conan mentally promised\nAram something.\n\n'Aram keeps his word,' grunted yet another. 'Many a man we have taken\nfrom his tavern. But we pay him well. I myself have given him ten bales\nof silk I stole from my master. It was good silk, by Set!'\n\nThe blacks shuffled past, bare splay feet scuffing up the dust, and\ntheir voices dwindled down the road.\n\n'Well for us those corpses are lying behind these huts,' muttered Conan.\n'If they look in Aram's death-room they'll find another. Let's begone.'\n\n'Yes, let us hasten!' begged the girl, almost hysterical again. 'My\nlover is wandering somewhere in the streets alone. The negroes may take\nhim.'\n\n'A devil of a custom this is!' growled Conan, as he led the way toward\nthe city, paralleling the road but keeping behind the huts and\nstraggling trees. 'Why don't the citizens clean out these black dogs?'\n\n'They are valuable slaves,' murmured the girl. 'There are so many of\nthem they might revolt if they were denied the flesh for which they\nlust. The people of Zamboula know they skulk the streets at night, and\nall are careful to remain within locked doors, except when something\nunforeseen happens, as it did to me. The blacks prey on anything they\ncatch, but they seldom catch anybody but strangers. The people of\nZamboula are not concerned with the strangers that pass through the\ncity.\n\n'Such men as Aram Baksh sell these strangers to the blacks. He would not\ndare attempt such a thing with a citizen.'\n\nConan spat in disgust, and a moment later led his companion out into the\nroad which was becoming a street, with still, unlighted houses on each\nside. Slinking in the shadows was not congenial to his nature.\n\n'Where do you want to go?' he asked. The girl did not seem to object to\nhis arm about her waist.\n\n'To my house, to rouse my servants,' she answered. 'To bid them search\nfor my lover. I do not wish the city--the priests--anyone--to know of\nhis madness. He--he is a young officer with a promising future. Perhaps\nwe can drive this madness from him if we can find him.'\n\n'If _we_ find him?' rumbled Conan. 'What makes you think I want to spend\nthe night scouring the streets for a lunatic?'\n\nShe cast a quick glance into his face, and properly interpreted the\ngleam in his blue eyes. Any woman could have known that he would follow\nher wherever she led--for a while, at least. But being a woman, she\nconcealed her knowledge of that fact.\n\n'Please,' she began with a hint of tears in her voice, 'I have no one\nelse to ask for help--you have been kind--'\n\n'All right!' he grunted. 'All right! What's the young reprobate's name?'\n\n'Why--Alafdhal. I am Zabibi, a dancing-girl. I have danced often before\nthe satrap, Jungir Khan, and his mistress Nafertari, and before all the\nlords and royal ladies of Zamboula. Totrasmek desired me, and because I\nrepulsed him, he made me the innocent tool of his vengeance against\nAlafdhal. I asked a love potion of Totrasmek, not suspecting the depth\nof his guile and hate. He gave me a drug to mix with my lover's wine,\nand he swore that when Alafdhal drank it, he would love me even more\nmadly than ever, and grant my every wish. I mixed the drug secretly with\nmy lover's wine. But having drunk, my lover went raving mad and things\ncame about as I have told you. Curse Totrasmek, the hybrid snake--ahhh!'\n\nShe caught his arm convulsively and both stopped short. They had come\ninto a district of shops and stalls, all deserted and unlighted, for the\nhour was late. They were passing an alley, and in its mouth a man was\nstanding, motionless and silent. His head was lowered, but Conan caught\nthe weird gleam of eery eyes regarding them unblinkingly. His skin\ncrawled, not with fear of the sword in the man's hand, but because of\nthe uncanny suggestion of his posture and silence. They suggested\nmadness. Conan pushed the girl aside and drew his sword.\n\n'Don't kill him!' she begged. 'In the name of Set, do not slay him! You\nare strong--overpower him!'\n\n'We'll see,' he muttered, grasping his sword in his right hand and\nclenching his left into a mallet-like fist.\n\nHe took a wary step toward the alley--and with a horrible moaning laugh\nthe Turanian charged. As he came he swung his sword, rising on his toes\nas he put all the power of his body behind the blows. Sparks flashed\nblue as Conan parried the blade, and the next instant the madman was\nstretched senseless in the dust from a thundering buffet of Conan's left\nfist.\n\nThe girl ran forward.\n\n'Oh, he is not--he is not--'\n\nConan bent swiftly, turned the man on his side and ran quick fingers\nover him.\n\n'He's not hurt much,' he grunted. 'Bleeding at the nose, but anybody's\nlikely to do that, after a clout on the jaw. He'll come to after a bit,\nand maybe his mind will be right. In the meantime I'll tie his wrists\nwith his sword-belt--so. Now where do you want me to take him?'\n\n'Wait!' She knelt beside the senseless figure, seized the bound hands\nand scanned them avidly. Then, shaking her head as if in baffled\ndisappointment, she rose. She came close to the giant Cimmerian, and\nlaid her slender hands on his arching breast. Her dark eyes, like wet\nblack jewels in the starlight, gazed up into his.\n\n'You are a man! Help me! Totrasmek must die! Slay him for me!'\n\n'And put my neck into a Turanian noose?' he grunted.\n\n'Nay!' The slender arms, strong as pliant steel, were around his corded\nneck. Her supple body throbbed against his. 'The Hyrkanians have no love\nfor Totrasmek. The priests of Set fear him. He is a mongrel, who rules\nmen by fear and superstition. I worship Set, and the Turanians bow to\nErlik, but Totrasmek sacrifices to Hanuman the accursed! The Turanian\nlords fear his black arts and his power over the hybrid population, and\nthey hate him. If he were slain in his temple at night, they would not\nseek his slayer very closely.'\n\n'And what of his magic?' rumbled the Cimmerian.\n\n'You are a fighting-man,' she answered. 'To risk your life is part of\nyour profession.'\n\n'For a price,' he admitted.\n\n'There will be a price!' she breathed, rising on tiptoe, to gaze into\nhis eyes.\n\nThe nearness of her vibrant body drove a flame through his veins. The\nperfume of her breath mounted to his brain. But as his arms closed about\nher supple figure she avoided them with a lithe movement, saying: 'Wait!\nFirst serve me in this matter.'\n\n'Name your price.' He spoke with some difficulty.\n\n'Pick up my lover,' she directed, and the Cimmerian stooped and swung\nthe tall form easily to his broad shoulder. At the moment he felt as if\nhe could have toppled over Jungir Khan's palace with equal ease. The\ngirl murmured an endearment to the unconscious man, and there was no\nhypocrisy in her attitude. She obviously loved Alafdhal sincerely.\nWhatever business arrangement she made with Conan would have no bearing\non her relationship with Alafdhal. Women are more practical about these\nthings than men.\n\n'Follow me!' She hurried along the street, while the Cimmerian strode\neasily after her, in no way discomforted by his limp burden. He kept a\nwary eye out for black shadows skulking under arches, but saw nothing\nsuspicious. Doubtless the men of Darfar were all gathered at the\nroasting-pit. The girl turned down a narrow side street, and presently\nknocked cautiously at an arched door.\n\nAlmost instantly a wicket opened in the upper panel, and a black face\nglanced out. She bent close to the opening, whispering swiftly. Bolts\ncreaked in their sockets, and the door opened. A giant black man stood\nframed against the soft glow of a copper lamp. A quick glance showed\nConan the man was not from Darfar. His teeth were unfiled and his kinky\nhair was cropped close to his skull. He was from the Wadai.\n\nAt a word from Zabibi, Conan gave the limp body into the black's arms,\nand saw the young officer laid on a velvet divan. He showed no signs of\nreturning consciousness. The blow that had rendered him senseless might\nhave felled an ox. Zabibi bent over him for an instant, her fingers\nnervously twining and twisting. Then she straightened and beckoned the\nCimmerian.\n\nThe door closed softly, the locks clicked behind them, and the closing\nwicket shut off the glow of the lamps. In the starlight of the street\nZabibi took Conan's hand. Her own hand trembled a little.\n\n'You will not fail me?'\n\nHe shook his maned head, massive against the stars.\n\n'Then follow me to Hanuman's shrine, and the gods have mercy on our\nsouls!'\n\nAlong the silent streets they moved like phantoms of antiquity. They\nwent in silence. Perhaps the girl was thinking of her lover lying\nsenseless on the divan under the copper lamps; or was shrinking with\nfear of what lay ahead of them in the demon-haunted shrine of Hanuman.\nThe barbarian was thinking only of the woman moving so supplely beside\nhim. The perfume of her scented hair was in his nostrils, the sensuous\naura of her presence filled his brain and left room for no other\nthoughts.\n\nOnce they heard the clank of brass-shod feet, and drew into the shadows\nof a gloomy arch while a squad of Pelishtim watchmen swung past. There\nwere fifteen of them; they marched in close formation, pikes at the\nready, and the rearmost men had their broad brass shields slung on their\nbacks, to protect them from a knife-stroke from behind. The skulking\nmenace of the black man-eaters was a threat even to armed men.\n\nAs soon as the clang of their sandals had receded up the street, Conan\nand the girl emerged from their hiding-place and hurried on. A few\nmoments later they saw the squat, flat-topped edifice they sought\nlooming ahead of them.\n\nThe temple of Hanuman stood alone in the midst of a broad square, which\nlay silent and deserted beneath the stars. A marble wall surrounded the\nshrine, with a broad opening directly before the portico. This opening\nhad no gate or any sort of barrier.\n\n'Why don't the blacks seek their prey here?' muttered Conan. 'There's\nnothing to keep them out of the temple.'\n\nHe could feel the trembling of Zabibi's body as she pressed close to\nhim.\n\n'They fear Totrasmek, as all in Zamboula fear him, even Jungir Khan and\nNafertari. Come! Come quickly, before my courage flows from me like\nwater!'\n\nThe girl's fear was evident, but she did not falter. Conan drew his\nsword and strode ahead of her as they advanced through the open gateway.\nHe knew the hideous habits of the priests of the East, and was aware\nthat an invader of Hanuman's shrine might expect to encounter almost any\nsort of nightmare horror. He knew there was a good chance that neither\nhe nor the girl would ever leave the shrine alive, but he had risked his\nlife too many times before to devote much thought to that consideration.\n\nThey entered a court paved with marble which gleamed whitely in the\nstarlight. A short flight of broad marble steps led up to the pillared\nportico. The great bronze doors stood wide open as they had stood for\ncenturies. But no worshippers burnt incense within. In the day men and\nwomen might come timidly into the shrine and place offerings to the\nape-god on the black altar. At night the people shunned the temple of\nHanuman as hares shun the lair of the serpent.\n\nBurning censers bathed the interior in a soft weird glow that created an\nillusion of unreality. Near the rear wall, behind the black stone altar,\nsat the god with his gaze fixed for ever on the open door, through which\nfor centuries his victims had come, dragged by chains of roses. A faint\ngroove ran from the sill to the altar, and when Conan's foot felt it, he\nstepped away as quickly as if he had trodden upon a snake. That groove\nhad been worn by the faltering feet of the multitude of those who had\ndied screaming on that grim altar.\n\nBestial in the uncertain light Hanuman leered with his carven mask. He\nsat, not as an ape would crouch, but cross-legged as a man would sit,\nbut his aspect was no less simian for that reason. He was carved from\nblack marble, but his eyes were rubies, which glowed red and lustful as\nthe coals of hell's deepest pits. His great hands lay upon his lap,\npalms upward, taloned fingers spread and grasping. In the gross emphasis\nof his attributes, in the leer of his satyr-countenance, was reflected\nthe abominable cynicism of the degenerate cult which deified him.\n\nThe girl moved around the image, making toward the back wall, and when\nher sleek flank brushed against a carven knee, she shrank aside and\nshuddered as if a reptile had touched her. There was a space of several\nfeet between the broad back of the idol and the marble wall with its\nfrieze of gold leaves. On either hand, flanking the idol, an ivory door\nunder a gold arch was set in the wall.\n\n'Those doors open into each end of a hair-pin shaped corridor,' she said\nhurriedly. 'Once I was in the interior of the shrine--once!' She\nshivered and twitched her slim shoulders at a memory both terrifying and\nobscene. 'The corridor is bent like a horseshoe, with each horn opening\ninto this room. Totrasmek's chambers are enclosed within the curve of\nthe corridor and open into it. But there is a secret door in this wall\nwhich opens directly into an inner chamber--'\n\nShe began to run her hands over the smooth surface, where no crack or\ncrevice showed. Conan stood beside her, sword in hand, glancing warily\nabout him. The silence, the emptiness of the shrine, with imagination\npicturing what might lie behind that wall, made him feel like a wild\nbeast nosing a trap.\n\n'Ah!' The girl had found a hidden spring at last; a square opening gaped\nblackly in the wall. 'Set!' she screamed, and even as Conan leaped\ntoward her, he saw that a great misshapen hand had fastened itself in\nher hair. She was snatched off her feet and jerked head-first through\nthe opening. Conan, grabbing ineffectually at her, felt his fingers slip\nfrom a naked limb, and in an instant she had vanished and the wall\nshowed blank as before. Only from beyond it came briefly the muffled\nsounds of a struggle, a scream, faintly heard, and a low laugh that made\nConan's blood congeal in his veins.\n\n\n\n\n3 Black Hands Gripping\n\n\nWith an oath the Cimmerian smote the wall a terrific blow with the\npommel of his sword, and the marble cracked and chipped. But the hidden\ndoor did not give way, and reason told him that doubtless it had been\nbolted on the other side of the wall. Turning, he sprang across the\nchamber to one of the ivory doors.\n\nHe lifted his sword to shatter the panels, but on a venture tried the\ndoor first with his left hand. It swung open easily, and he glared into\na long corridor that curved away into dimness under the weird light of\ncensers similar to those in the shrine. A heavy gold bolt showed on the\njamb of the door, and he touched it lightly with his finger tips. The\nfaint warmness of the metal could have been detected only by a man whose\nfaculties were akin to those of a wolf. That bolt had been touched--and\ntherefore drawn--within the last few seconds. The affair was taking on\nmore and more of the aspect of a baited trap. He might have known\nTotrasmek would know when anyone entered the temple.\n\nTo enter the corridor would undoubtedly be to walk into whatever trap\nthe priest had set for him. But Conan did not hesitate. Somewhere in\nthat dim-lit interior Zabibi was a captive, and, from what he knew of\nthe characteristics of Hanuman's priests, he was sure that she needed\nhelp badly. Conan stalked into the corridor with a pantherish tread,\npoised to strike right or left.\n\nOn his left, ivory, arched doors opened into the corridor, and he tried\neach in turn. All were locked. He had gone perhaps seventy-five feet\nwhen the corridor bent sharply to the left, describing the curve the\ngirl had mentioned. A door opened into this curve, and it gave under his\nhand.\n\nHe was looking into a broad, square chamber, somewhat more clearly\nlighted than the corridor. Its walls were of white marble, the floor of\nivory, the ceiling of fretted silver. He saw divans of rich satin,\ngold-worked footstools of ivory, a disk-shaped table of some massive,\nmetal-like substance. On one of the divans a man was reclining, looking\ntoward the door. He laughed as he met the Cimmerian's startled glare.\n\nThis man was naked except for a loin-cloth and high-strapped sandals. He\nwas brown-skinned, with close-cropped black hair and restless black eyes\nthat set off a broad, arrogant face. In girth and breadth he was\nenormous, with huge limbs on which the great muscles swelled and rippled\nat each slightest movement. His hands were the largest Conan had ever\nseen. The assurance of gigantic physical strength colored his every\naction and inflection.\n\n'Why not enter, barbarian?' he called mockingly, with an exaggerated\ngesture of invitation.\n\nConan's eyes began to smolder ominously, but he trod warily into the\nchamber, his sword ready.\n\n'Who the devil are you?' he growled.\n\n'I am Baal-pteor,' the man answered. 'Once, long ago and in another\nland, I had another name. But this is a good name, and why Totrasmek\ngave it to me, any temple wench can tell you.'\n\n'So you're his dog!' grunted Conan. 'Well, curse your brown hide,\nBaal-pteor, where's the wench you jerked through the wall?'\n\n'My master entertains her!' laughed Baal-pteor. 'Listen!'\n\nFrom beyond a door opposite the one by which Conan had entered there\nsounded a woman's scream, faint and muffled in the distance.\n\n'Blast your soul!' Conan took a stride toward the door, then wheeled\nwith his skin tingling. Baal-pteor was laughing at him, and that laugh\nwas edged with menace that made the hackles rise on Conan's neck and\nsent a red wave of murder-lust driving across his vision.\n\nHe started toward Baal-pteor, the knuckles on his sword-hand showing\nwhite. With a swift motion the brown man threw something at him--a\nshining crystal sphere that glistened in the weird light.\n\nConan dodged instinctively, but, miraculously, the globe stopped short\nin midair, a few feet from his face. It did not fall to the floor. It\nhung suspended, as if by invisible filaments, some five feet above the\nfloor. And as he glared in amazement, it began to rotate with growing\nspeed. And as it revolved it grew, expanded, became nebulous. It filled\nthe chamber. It enveloped him. It blotted out furniture, walls, the\nsmiling countenance of Baal-pteor. He was lost in the midst of a\nblinding bluish blur of whirling speed. Terrific winds screamed past\nConan, tugging, tearing at him, striving to wrench him from his feet, to\ndrag him into the vortex that spun madly before him.\n\nWith a choking cry Conan lurched backward, reeled, felt the solid wall\nagainst his back. At the contact the illusion ceased to be. The\nwhirling, titanic sphere vanished like a bursting bubble. Conan reeled\nupright in the silver-ceilinged room, with a gray mist coiling about his\nfeet, and saw Baal-pteor lolling on the divan, shaking with silent\nlaughter.\n\n'Son of a slut!' Conan lunged at him. But the mist swirled up from the\nfloor, blotting out that giant brown form. Groping in a rolling cloud\nthat blinded him, Conan felt a rending sensation of dislocation--and\nthen room and mist and brown man were gone together. He was standing\nalone among the high reeds of a marshy fen, and a buffalo was lunging at\nhim, head down. He leaped aside from the ripping scimitar-curved horns,\nand drove his sword in behind the foreleg, through ribs and heart. And\nthen it was not a buffalo dying there in the mud, but the brown-skinned\nBaal-pteor. With a curse Conan struck off his head; and the head soared\nfrom the ground and snapped beast-like tusks into his throat. For all\nhis mighty strength he could not tear it loose--he was\nchoking--strangling; then there was a rush and roar through space, the\ndislocating shock of an immeasurable impact, and he was back in the\nchamber with Baal-pteor, whose head was once more set firmly on his\nshoulders, and who laughed silently at him from the divan.\n\n'Mesmerism!' muttered Conan, crouching and digging his toes hard against\nthe marble.\n\nHis eyes blazed. This brown dog was playing with him, making sport of\nhim! But this mummery, this child's play of mists and shadows of\nthought, it could not harm him. He had but to leap and strike and the\nbrown acolyte would be a mangled corpse under his heel. This time he\nwould not be fooled by shadows of illusion--but he was.\n\nA blood-curdling snarl sounded behind him, and he wheeled and struck in\na flash at the panther crouching to spring on him from the metal-colored\ntable. Even as he struck, the apparition vanished and his blade clashed\ndeafeningly on the adamantine surface. Instantly he sensed something\nabnormal. The blade stuck to the table! He wrenched at it savagely. It\ndid not give. This was no mesmeristic trick. The table was a giant\nmagnet. He gripped the hilt with both hands, when a voice at his\nshoulder brought him about, to face the brown man, who had at last risen\nfrom the divan.\n\nSlightly taller than Conan, and much heavier, Baal-pteor loomed before\nhim, a daunting image of muscular development. His mighty arms were\nunnaturally long, and his great hands opened and closed, twitching\nconvulsively. Conan released the hilt of his imprisoned sword and fell\nsilent, watching his enemy through slitted lids.\n\n'Your head, Cimmerian!' taunted Baal-pteor. 'I shall take it with my\nbare hands, twisting it from your shoulders as the head of a fowl is\ntwisted! Thus the sons of Kosala offer sacrifice to Yajur. Barbarian,\nyou look upon a strangler of Yota-pong. I was chosen by the priests of\nYajur in my infancy, and throughout childhood, boyhood and youth I\ntrained in the art of slaying with the naked hands--for only thus are\nthe sacrifices enacted. Yajur loves blood, and we waste not a drop from\nthe victim's veins. When I was a child they gave me infants to throttle;\nwhen I was a boy I strangled young girls; as a youth, women, old men and\nyoung boys. Not until I reached my full manhood was I given a strong man\nto slay on the altar of Yota-pong.\n\n'For years I offered the sacrifices to Yajur. Hundreds of necks have\nsnapped between these fingers--' he worked them before the Cimmerian's\nangry eyes. 'Why I fled from Yota-pong to become Totrasmek's servant is\nno concern of yours. In a moment you will be beyond curiosity. The\npriests of Kosala, the stranglers of Yajur, are strong beyond the belief\nof men. And I was stronger than any. With my hands, barbarian, I shall\nbreak your neck!'\n\nAnd like the stroke of twin cobras, the great hands closed on Conan's\nthroat. The Cimmerian made no attempt to dodge or fend them away, but\nhis own hands darted to the Kosalan's bull-neck. Baal-pteor's black eyes\nwidened as he felt the thick cords of muscles that protected the\nbarbarian's throat. With a snarl he exerted his inhuman strength, and\nknots and lumps and ropes of thews rose along his massive arms. And then\na choking gasp burst from him as Conan's fingers locked on his throat.\nFor an instant they stood there like statues, their faces masks of\neffort, veins beginning to stand out purply on their temples. Conan's\nthin lips drew back from his teeth in a grinning snarl. Baal-pteor's\neyes were distended; in them grew an awful surprize and the glimmer of\nfear. Both men stood motionless as images, except for the expanding of\ntheir muscles on rigid arms and braced legs, but strength beyond common\nconception was warring there--strength that might have uprooted trees\nand crushed the skulls of bullocks.\n\nThe wind whistled suddenly from between Baal-pteor's parted teeth. His\nface was growing purple. Fear flooded his eyes. His thews seemed ready\nto burst from his arms and shoulders, yet the muscles of the Cimmerian's\nthick neck did not give; they felt like masses of woven iron cords under\nhis desperate fingers. But his own flesh was giving way under the iron\nfingers of the Cimmerian which ground deeper and deeper into the\nyielding throat-muscles, crushing them in upon jugular and windpipe.\n\nThe statuesque immobility of the group gave way to sudden, frenzied\nmotion, as the Kosalan began to wrench and heave, seeking to throw\nhimself backward. He let go of Conan's throat and grasped his wrists,\ntrying to tear away those inexorable fingers.\n\nWith a sudden lunge Conan bore him backward until the small of his back\ncrashed against the table. And still farther over its edge Conan bent\nhim, back and back, until his spine was ready to snap.\n\nConan's low laugh was merciless as the ring of steel.\n\n'You fool!' he all but whispered. 'I think you never saw a man from the\nWest before. Did you deem yourself strong, because you were able to\ntwist the heads off civilized folk, poor weaklings with muscles like\nrotten string? Hell! Break the neck of a wild Cimmerian bull before you\ncall yourself strong. I did that, before I was a full-grown man--like\nthis!'\n\nAnd with a savage wrench he twisted Baal-pteor's head around until the\nghastly face leered over the left shoulder, and the vertebrae snapped\nlike a rotten branch.\n\nConan hurled the flopping corpse to the floor, turned to the sword again\nand gripped the hilt with both hands, bracing his feet against the\nfloor. Blood trickled down his broad breast from the wounds Baal-pteor's\nfinger nails had torn in the skin of his neck. His black hair was damp,\nsweat ran down his face, and his chest heaved. For all his vocal scorn\nof Baal-pteor's strength, he had almost met his match in the inhuman\nKosalan. But without pausing to catch his breath, he exerted all his\nstrength in a mighty wrench that tore the sword from the magnet where it\nclung.\n\nAnother instant and he had pushed open the door from behind which the\nscream had sounded, and was looking down a long straight corridor, lined\nwith ivory doors. The other end was masked by a rich velvet curtain, and\nfrom beyond that curtain came the devilish strains of such music as\nConan had never heard, not even in nightmares. It made the short hairs\nbristle on the back of his neck. Mingled with it was the panting,\nhysterical sobbing of a woman. Grasping his sword firmly, he glided down\nthe corridor.\n\n\n\n\n4 Dance, Girl, Dance!\n\n\nWhen Zabibi was jerked head-first through the aperture which opened in\nthe wall behind the idol, her first, dizzy, disconnected thought was\nthat her time had come. She instinctively shut her eyes and waited for\nthe blow to fall. But instead she felt herself dumped unceremoniously\nonto the smooth marble floor, which bruised her knees and hip. Opening\nher eyes she stared fearfully around her, just as a muffled impact\nsounded from beyond the wall. She saw a brown-skinned giant in a\nloin-cloth standing over her, and, across the chamber into which she had\ncome, a man sat on a divan, with his back to a rich velvet curtain, a\nbroad, fleshy man, with fat white hands and snaky eyes. And her flesh\ncrawled, for this man was Totrasmek, the priest of Hanuman, who for\nyears had spun his slimy webs of power throughout the city of Zamboula.\n\n'The barbarian seeks to batter his way through the wall,' said Totrasmek\nsardonically, 'but the bolt will hold.'\n\nThe girl saw that a heavy golden bolt had been shot across the hidden\ndoor, which was plainly discernible from this side of the wall. The bolt\nand its sockets would have resisted the charge of an elephant.\n\n'Go open one of the doors for him, Baal-pteor,' ordered Totrasmek. 'Slay\nhim in the square chamber at the other end of the corridor.'\n\nThe Kosalan salaamed and departed by the way of a door in the side wall\nof the chamber. Zabibi rose, staring fearfully at the priest, whose eyes\nran avidly over her splendid figure. To this she was indifferent. A\ndancer of Zamboula was accustomed to nakedness. But the cruelty in his\neyes started her limbs to quivering.\n\n'Again you come to me in my retreat, beautiful one,' he purred with\ncynical hypocrisy. 'It is an unexpected honor. You seemed to enjoy your\nformer visit so little, that I dared not hope for you to repeat it. Yet\nI did all in my power to provide you with an interesting experience.'\n\nFor a Zamboulan dancer to blush would be an impossibility, but a smolder\nof anger mingled with the fear in Zabibi's dilated eyes.\n\n'Fat pig! You know I did not come here for love of you.'\n\n'No,' laughed Totrasmek, 'you came like a fool, creeping through the\nnight with a stupid barbarian to cut my throat. Why should you seek my\nlife?'\n\n'You know why!' she cried, knowing the futility of trying to dissemble.\n\n'You are thinking of your lover,' he laughed. 'The fact that you are\nhere seeking my life shows that he quaffed the drug I gave you. Well,\ndid you not ask for it? And did I not send what you asked for, out of\nthe love I bear you?'\n\n'I asked you for a drug that would make him slumber harmlessly for a few\nhours,' she said bitterly. 'And you--you sent your servant with a drug\nthat drove him mad! I was a fool ever to trust you. I might have known\nyour protestations of friendship were lies, to disguise your hate and\nspite.'\n\n'Why did you wish your lover to sleep?' he retorted. 'So you could steal\nfrom him the only thing he would never give you--the ring with the jewel\nmen call the Star of Khorala--the star stolen from the Queen of Ophir,\nwho would pay a roomful of gold for its return. He would not give it to\nyou willingly, because he knew that it holds a magic which, when\nproperly controlled, will enslave the hearts of any of the opposite sex.\nYou wished to steal it from him, fearing that his magicians would\ndiscover the key to that magic and he would forget you in his conquests\nof the queens of the world. You would sell it back to the queen of\nOphir, who understands its power and would use it to enslave men, as she\ndid before it was stolen.'\n\n'And why did _you_ want it?' she demanded sulkily.\n\n'I understand its powers. It would increase the power of my arts.'\n\n'Well,' she snapped, 'you have it now!'\n\n'_I_ have the Star of Khorala? Nay, you err.'\n\n'Why bother to lie?' she retorted bitterly. 'He had it on his finger\nwhen he drove me into the streets. He did not have it when I found him\nagain. Your servant must have been watching the house, and have taken it\nfrom him, after I escaped him. To the devil with it! I want my lover\nback sane and whole. You have the ring; you have punished us both. Why\ndo you not restore his mind to him? Can you?'\n\n'I could,' he assured her, in evident enjoyment of her distress. He drew\na phial from among his robes. 'This contains the juice of the golden\nlotus. If your lover drank it he would be sane again. Yes, I will be\nmerciful. You have both thwarted and flouted me, not once but many\ntimes; he has constantly opposed my wishes. But I will be merciful. Come\nand take the phial from my hand.'\n\nShe stared at Totrasmek, trembling with eagerness to seize it, but\nfearing it was but some cruel jest. She advanced timidly, with a hand\nextended, and he laughed heartlessly and drew back out of her reach.\nEven as her lips parted to curse him, some instinct snatched her eyes\nupward. From the gilded ceiling four jade-hued vessels were falling. She\ndodged, but they did not strike her. They crashed to the floor about\nher, forming the four corners of a square. And she screamed, and\nscreamed again. For out of each ruin reared the hooded head of a cobra,\nand one struck at her bare leg. Her convulsive movement to evade it\nbrought her within reach of the one on the other side and again she had\nto shift like lightning to avoid the flash of its hideous head.\n\nShe was caught in a frightful trap. All four serpents were swaying and\nstriking at foot, ankle, calf, knee, thigh, hip, whatever portion of her\nvoluptuous body chanced to be nearest to them, and she could not spring\nover them or pass between them to safety. She could only whirl and\nspring aside and twist her body to avoid the strokes, and each time she\nmoved to dodge one snake, the motion brought her within range of\nanother, so that she had to keep shifting with the speed of light. She\ncould move only a short space in any direction, and the fearful hooded\ncrests were menacing her every second. Only a dancer of Zamboula could\nhave lived in that grisly square.\n\nShe became, herself, a blur of bewildering motion. The heads missed her\nby hair's breadths, but they missed, as she pitted her twinkling feet,\nflickering limbs and perfect eye against the blinding speed of the scaly\ndemons her enemy had conjured out of thin air.\n\nSomewhere a thin whining music struck up, mingling with the hissing of\nthe serpents, like an evil night-wind blowing through the empty sockets\nof a skull. Even in the flying speed of her urgent haste she realized\nthat the darting of the serpents was no longer at random. They obeyed\nthe grisly piping of the eery music. They struck with a horrible rhythm,\nand perforce her swaying, writhing, spinning body attuned itself to\ntheir rhythm. Her frantic motions melted into the measures of a dance\ncompared to which the most obscene tarantella of Zamora would have\nseemed sane and restrained. Sick with shame and terror Zabibi heard the\nhateful mirth of her merciless tormentor.\n\n'The Dance of the Cobras, my lovely one!' laughed Totrasmek. 'So maidens\ndanced in the sacrifice to Hanuman centuries ago--but never with such\nbeauty and suppleness. Dance, girl, dance! How long can you avoid the\nfangs of the Poison People? Minutes? Hours? You will weary at last. Your\nswift, sure feet will stumble, your legs falter, your hips slow in their\nrotations. Then the fangs will begin to sink deep into your ivory\nflesh--'\n\nBehind him the curtain shook as if struck by a gust of wind, and\nTotrasmek screamed. His eyes dilated and his hands caught convulsively\nat the length of bright steel which jutted suddenly from his breast.\n\nThe music broke off short. The girl swayed dizzily in her dance, crying\nout in dreadful anticipation of the flickering fangs--and then only four\nwisps of harmless blue smoke curled up from the floor about her, as\nTotrasmek sprawled headlong from the divan.\n\nConan came from behind the curtain, wiping his broad blade. Looking\nthrough the hangings he had seen the girl dancing desperately between\nfour swaying spirals of smoke, but he had guessed that their appearance\nwas very different to her. He knew he had killed Totrasmek.\n\nZabibi sank down on the floor, panting, but even as Conan started toward\nher, she staggered up again, though her legs trembled with exhaustion.\n\n'The phial!' she gasped. 'The phial!'\n\nTotrasmek still grasped it in his stiffening hand. Ruthlessly she tore\nit from his locked fingers, and then began frantically to ransack his\ngarments.\n\n'What the devil are you looking for?' Conan demanded.\n\n'A ring--he stole it from Alafdhal. He must have, while my lover walked\nin madness through the streets. Set's devils!'\n\nShe had convinced herself that it was not on the person of Totrasmek.\nShe began to cast about the chamber, tearing up divan-covers and\nhangings, and upsetting vessels.\n\nShe paused and raked a damp lock of hair out of her eyes.\n\n'I forgot Baal-pteor!'\n\n'He's in hell with his neck broken,' Conan assured her.\n\nShe expressed vindictive gratification at the news, but an instant later\nswore expressively.\n\n'We can't stay here. It's not many hours until dawn. Lesser priests are\nlikely to visit the temple at any hour of the night, and if we're\ndiscovered here with his corpse, the people will tear us to pieces. The\nTuranians could not save us.'\n\nShe lifted the bolt on the secret door, and a few moments later they\nwere in the streets and hurrying away from the silent square where\nbrooded the age-old shrine of Hanuman.\n\nIn a winding street a short distance away Conan halted and checked his\ncompanion with a heavy hand on her naked shoulder.\n\n'Don't forget there was a price--'\n\n'I have not forgotten!' She twisted free. 'But we must go to--to\nAlafdhal first!'\n\nA few minutes later the black slave let them through the wicket door.\nThe young Turanian lay upon the divan, his arms and legs bound with\nheavy velvet ropes. His eyes were open, but they were like those of a\nmad dog, and foam was thick on his lips. Zabibi shuddered.\n\n'Force his jaws open!' she commanded, and Conan's iron fingers\naccomplished the task.\n\nZabibi emptied the phial down the maniac's gullet. The effect was like\nmagic. Instantly he became quiet. The glare faded from his eyes; he\nstared up at the girl in a puzzled way, but with recognition and\nintelligence. Then he fell into a normal slumber.\n\n'When he awakes he will be quite sane,' she whispered, motioning to the\nsilent slave.\n\nWith a deep bow he gave into her hands a small leathern bag, and drew\nabout her shoulders a silken cloak. Her manner had subtly changed when\nshe beckoned Conan to follow her out of the chamber.\n\nIn an arch that opened on the street, she turned to him, drawing herself\nup with a new regality.\n\n'I must now tell you the truth,' she said. 'I am not Zabibi. I am\nNafertari. And _he_ is not Alafdhal, a poor captain of the guardsmen. He\nis Jungir Khan, satrap of Zamboula.'\n\nConan made no comment; his scarred dark countenance was immobile.\n\n'I lied to you because I dared not divulge the truth to anyone,' she\nsaid. 'We were alone when Jungir Khan went mad. None knew of it but\nmyself. Had it been known that the satrap of Zamboula was a madman,\nthere would have been instant revolt and rioting, even as Totrasmek\nplanned, who plotted our destruction.\n\n'You see now how impossible is the reward for which you hoped. The\nsatrap's mistress is not--cannot be for you. But you shall not go\nunrewarded. Here is a sack of gold.'\n\nShe gave him the bag she had received from the slave.\n\n'Go, now, and when the sun is come up to the palace, I will have Jungir\nKhan make you captain of his guard. But you will take your orders from\nme, secretly. Your first duty will be to march a squad to the shrine of\nHanuman, ostensibly to search for clues of the priest's slayer; in\nreality to search for the Star of Khorala. It must be hidden there\nsomewhere. When you find it, bring it to me. You have my leave to go\nnow.'\n\nHe nodded, still silent, and strode away. The girl, watching the swing\nof his broad shoulders, was piqued to note that there was nothing in his\nbearing to show that he was in any way chagrined or abashed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he had rounded a corner, he glanced back, and then changed his\ndirection and quickened his pace. A few moments later he was in the\nquarter of the city containing the Horse Market. There he smote on a\ndoor until from the window above a bearded head was thrust to demand the\nreason for the disturbance.\n\n'A horse,' demanded Conan. 'The swiftest steed you have.'\n\n'I open no gates at this time of night,' grumbled the horse-trader.\n\nConan rattled his coins.\n\n'Dog's son knave! Don't you see I'm white, and alone? Come down, before\nI smash your door!'\n\nPresently, on a bay stallion, Conan was riding toward the house of Aram\nBaksh.\n\nHe turned off the road into the alley that lay between the tavern\ncompound and the date-palm garden, but he did not pause at the gate. He\nrode on to the northeast corner of the wall, then turned and rode along\nthe north wall, to halt within a few paces of the northwest angle. No\ntrees grew near the wall, but there were some low bushes. To one of\nthese he tied his horse, and was about to climb into the saddle again,\nwhen he heard a low muttering of voices beyond the corner of the wall.\n\nDrawing his foot from the stirrup he stole to the angle and peered\naround it. Three men were moving down the road toward the palm groves,\nand from their slouching gait he knew they were negroes. They halted at\nhis low call, bunching themselves as he strode toward them, his sword in\nhis hand. Their eyes gleamed whitely in the starlight. Their brutish\nlust shone in their ebony faces, but they knew their three cudgels could\nnot prevail against his sword, just as he knew it.\n\n'Where are you going?' he challenged.\n\n'To bid our brothers put out the fire in the pit beyond the groves,' was\nthe sullen, guttural reply. 'Aram Baksh promised us a man, but he lied.\nWe found one of our brothers dead in the trap-chamber. We go hungry this\nnight.'\n\n'I think not,' smiled Conan. 'Aram Baksh will give you a man. Do you see\nthat door?'\n\nHe pointed to a small, iron-bound portal set in the midst of the western\nwall.\n\n'Wait there. Aram Baksh will give you a man.'\n\nBacking warily away until he was out of reach of a sudden bludgeon blow,\nhe turned and melted around the northwest angle of the wall. Reaching\nhis horse he paused to ascertain that the blacks were not sneaking after\nhim, and then he climbed into the saddle and stood upright on it,\nquieting the uneasy steed with a low word. He reached up, grasped the\ncoping of the wall and drew himself up and over. There he studied the\ngrounds for an instant. The tavern was built in the southwest corner of\nthe enclosure, the remaining space of which was occupied by groves and\ngardens. He saw no one in the grounds. The tavern was dark and silent,\nand he knew all the doors and windows were barred and bolted.\n\nConan knew that Aram Baksh slept in a chamber that opened into a\ncypress-bordered path that led to the door in the western wall. Like a\nshadow he glided among the trees and a few moments later he rapped\nlightly on the chamber door.\n\n'What is it?' asked a rumbling voice within.\n\n'Aram Baksh!' hissed Conan. 'The blacks are stealing over the wall!'\n\nAlmost instantly the door opened, framing the tavern-keeper, naked but\nfor his shirt, with a dagger in his hand.\n\nHe craned his neck to stare into the Cimmerian's face.\n\n'What tale is this--_you!_'\n\nConan's vengeful fingers strangled the yell in his throat. They went to\nthe floor together and Conan wrenched the dagger from his enemy's hand.\nThe blade glinted in the starlight, and blood spurted. Aram Baksh made\nhideous noises, gasping and gagging on a mouthful of blood. Conan\ndragged him to his feet and again the dagger slashed, and most of the\ncurly beard fell to the floor.\n\nStill gripping his captive's throat--for a man can scream incoherently\neven with his tongue slit--Conan dragged him out of the dark chamber and\ndown the cypress-shadowed path, to the iron-bound door in the outer\nwall. With one hand he lifted the bolt and threw the door open,\ndisclosing the three shadowy figures which waited like black vultures\noutside. Into their eager arms Conan thrust the innkeeper.\n\nA horrible, blood-choked scream rose from the Zamboulan's throat, but\nthere was no response from the silent tavern. The people there were used\nto screams outside the wall. Aram Baksh fought like a wild man, his\ndistended eyes turned frantically on the Cimmerian's face. He found no\nmercy there. Conan was thinking of the scores of wretches who owed their\nbloody doom to this man's greed.\n\nIn glee the negroes dragged him down the road, mocking his frenzied\ngibberings. How could they recognize Aram Baksh in this half-naked,\nbloodstained figure, with the grotesquely shorn beard and unintelligible\nbabblings? The sounds of the struggle came back to Conan, standing\nbeside the gate, even after the clump of figures had vanished among the\npalms.\n\nClosing the door behind him, Conan returned to his horse, mounted and\nturned westward, toward the open desert, swinging wide to skirt the\nsinister belt of palm groves. As he rode, he drew from his belt a ring\nin which gleamed a jewel that snared the starlight in a shimmering\niridescence. He held it up to admire it, turning it this way and that.\nThe compact bag of gold pieces clinked gently at his saddle-bow, like a\npromise of the greater riches to come.\n\n'I wonder what she'd say if she knew I recognized her as Nafertari and\nhim as Jungir Khan the instant I saw them,' he mused. 'I knew the Star\nof Khorala, too. There'll be a fine scene if she ever guesses that I\nslipped it off his finger while I was tying him with his sword-belt. But\nthey'll never catch me, with the start I'm getting.'\n\nHe glanced back at the shadowy palm groves, among which a red glare was\nmounting. A chanting rose to the night, vibrating with savage\nexultation. And another sound mingled with it, a mad, incoherent\nscreaming, a frenzied gibbering in which no words could be\ndistinguished. The noise followed Conan as he rode westward beneath the\npaling stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Shadows in Zamboula, by Robert E.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
