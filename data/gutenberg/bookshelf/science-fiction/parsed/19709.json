Check in!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye,\" a bull-throated voice bellowed over the loud-speaker.\n\n\"Stand by rockets, Astro! We're coming in for a landing.\"\n\n\"Standing by!\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer turned away from the telescanner and glanced\nquickly over the illuminated banks of indicators on the control panel.\n\"Is our orbit to Space Academy clear?\" he asked the cadet. \"Have we been\nassigned a landing ramp?\"\n\n\"I'll check topside, sir,\" answered the cadet, turning back to the\nintercom. \"Control deck to radar deck. Check in!\"\n\n\"Radar bridge, aye,\" drawled a lazy voice over the speaker.\n\n\"Are we cleared for landing, Roger?\"\n\n\"Everything clear as glass ahead, Tom,\" was the calm reply.\n\n\"We're steady on orbit and we touch down on ramp seven. Then\"--the voice\nbegan to quicken with excitement--\"three weeks' liberty coming up!\"\n\nThe rumbling voice of the power-deck cadet suddenly broke in over the\nintercom. \"Lay off that space gas, Manning. Just see that this space\nwagon gets on the ground in one piece. Then you can dream about your\nleave!\"\n\n\"Plug your jets, you big Venusian ape man,\" was the reply, \"or I'll turn\nyou inside out!\"\n\n\"Yeah? You and what fleet of spaceships?\"\n\n\"Just me, buster, with my bare hands!\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer on the control deck smiled at the young cadet\nbeside him as the good-natured argument crackled over the intercom\nspeaker overhead. \"Looks like those two will never stop battling,\nCorbett,\" he commented dryly.\n\n\"Guess they'll never learn, sir,\" sighed the cadet.\n\n\"That's all right. It's when they stop battling that I'll start getting\nworried,\" answered the officer. He turned back to the controls. \"One\nhundred thousand feet from Earth's surface! Begin landing procedure!\"\n\nAs Cadet Tom Corbett snapped orders into the intercom and his unit-mates\nresponded by smooth co-ordinated action, the giant rocket cruiser\n_Polaris_ slowly arched through Earth's atmosphere, first nosing up to\nlose speed and then settling tailfirst toward its destination--the\nspaceport at Space Academy, U.S.A.\n\nFar below, on the grounds of the Academy, cadets wearing the green\nuniforms of first-year Earthworms and the blue of the upper-classmen\nstopped all activity as they heard the blasting of the braking rockets\nhigh in the heavens. They stared enviously into the sky, watching the\nsmooth steel-hulled spaceship drop toward the concrete ramp area of the\nspaceport, three miles away.\n\n[Illustration: SPACE ACADEMY U.S.A.]\n\nIn his office at the top of the gleaming Tower of Galileo, Commander\nWalters, commandant of Space Academy, paused for a moment from his\nduties and turned from his desk to watch the touchdown of the great\nspaceship. And on the grassy quadrangle, Warrant Officer Mike McKenny,\nshort and stubby in his scarlet uniform of the enlisted Solar Guard,\nstopped his frustrating task of drilling newly arrived cadets to watch\nthe mighty ship come to Earth.\n\nYoung and old, the feeling of belonging to the great fleet that\npatrolled the space lanes across the millions of miles of the solar\nsystem was something that never died in a true spaceman. The green-clad\ncadets dreamed of the future when they would feel the bucking rockets in\ntheir backs. And the older men smiled faintly as memories of their own\nfirst space flight came to mind.\n\nAboard the _Polaris_, the young cadet crew worked swiftly and smoothly\nto bring their ship to a safe landing. There was Tom Corbett, an average\nyoung man in this age of science, who had been selected as the\ncontrol-deck and command cadet of the _Polaris_ unit after rigid\nexaminations and tests. Topside, on the radar bridge, was Roger Manning,\ncocky and brash, but a specialist in radar and communications. Below, on\nthe power deck, was Astro, a colonial from Venus, who had been accused\nof cutting his teeth on an atomic rocket motor, so great was his skill\nwith the mighty \"thrust buckets,\" as he lovingly called the atomic\nrockets.\n\nNow, returning from a routine training flight that had taken them to the\nmoons of Jupiter, the three cadets, Corbett, Manning, and Astro, and\ntheir unit skipper, Captain Steve Strong, completed the delicate task of\nsetting the great ship down on the Academy spaceport.\n\n\"Closing in fast, sir,\" announced Tom, his attention focused on the\nmeters and dials in front of him. \"Five hundred feet to touchdown.\"\n\n\"Full braking thrust!\" snapped Strong crisply.\n\nDeep inside the _Polaris_, braking rockets roared with unceasing power,\nand the mighty spaceship eased itself to the concrete surface of the\nAcademy spaceport.\n\n\"Touchdown!\" yelled Tom. He quickly closed the master control lever,\ncutting all power, and sudden silence filled the ship. He stood up and\nfaced Strong, saluting smartly.\n\n\"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ completes mission\"--he glanced at the astral\nchronometer on the panel board--\"at fifteen thirty-three, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" replied Strong, returning the salute. \"Check the\n_Polaris_ from radar mast to exhaust ports right away.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" was Tom's automatic answer, and then he caught himself. \"But\nI thought--\"\n\nStrong interrupted him with a wave of his hand. \"I know, Corbett, you\nthought the _Polaris_ would be pulled in for a general overhaul and you\nthree would get liberty.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"I'm not sure you won't get it,\" said Strong, \"but I received a message\nlast night from Commander Walters. I think the _Polaris_ unit might have\nanother assignment coming up!\"\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" drawled Roger from the open hatch to the radar\nbridge, \"you might know the old man would have another mission for us!\nWe haven't had a liberty since we were Earthworms!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Manning,\" said Strong, \"but you know if I had my way, you'd\ncertainly get the liberty. If anyone deserves it, you three do.\"\n\nBy this time Astro had joined the group on the control deck.\n\n\"But, sir,\" ventured Tom, \"we've all made plans, I mean--well, my folks\nare expecting me.\"\n\n\"_Us_, you mean,\" interrupted Roger. \"Astro and I are your guests,\nremember?\"\n\n\"Sure, I remember,\" said Tom, smiling. He turned back to Captain Strong.\n\"We'd appreciate it if you could do something for us, sir. I\nmean--well, have another unit assigned.\"\n\nStrong stepped forward and put his arms around the shoulders of Tom and\nRoger and faced Astro. \"I'm afraid you three made a big mistake in\nbecoming the best unit in the Academy. Now every time there's an\nimportant assignment to be handed out the name of the _Polaris_ unit\nsticks out like a hot rocket!\"\n\n\"Some consolation,\" said Roger dourly.\n\nStrong smiled. \"All right, check this wagon and then report to me in my\nquarters in the morning. You'll have tonight off at least. Unit\n_dis_-missed!\"\n\nThe three cadets snapped their backs straight, stood rigid, and saluted\nas their superior officer strode toward the hatch. His foot on the\nladder, he turned and faced them again.\n\n\"It's been a fine mission. I want to compliment you on the way you've\nhandled yourselves these past few months. You boys are real spacemen!\"\nHe saluted and disappeared down the ladder leading to the exit port.\n\n\"And that,\" said Roger, turning to his unit-mates, \"is known as the\nroyal come-on for a dirty detail!\"\n\n\"Ahhh, stop your gassing, Manning,\" growled Astro. \"Just be sure your\nradar bridge is O.K. If we do have to blast out of here in a hurry, I\nwant to get where we're supposed to be going!\"\n\n\"You just worry about the power deck, spaceboy, and let little Roger\ntake care of his own department,\" replied Roger.\n\nAstro eyed him speculatively. \"You know the only reason they allowed\nthis space creep in the Academy, Tom?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"No, why?\" asked Tom, playing along with the game.\n\n\"Because they knew any time the _Polaris_ ran out of reactant fuel we\ncould just stick Manning in the rocket tubes and have him blow out some\nof his special brand of space gas!\"\n\n\"Listen, you Venusian throwback! One more word out of you and--\"\n\n\"All right, you two!\" broke in Tom good-naturedly. \"Enough's enough!\nCome on. We've got just enough time to run up to the mess hall and grab\na good meal before we check the ship.\"\n\n\"That's for me,\" said Astro. \"I've been eating those concentrates so\nlong my stomach thinks I've turned into a test tube.\"\n\nAstro referred to the food taken along on space missions. It was\ndehydrated and packed in plastic containers to save weight and space.\nThe concentrates never made a satisfactory meal, even though they\nsupplied everything necessary for a healthful diet.\n\nA few moments later the three members of the _Polaris_ stood on the main\nslidewalk, an endless belt of plastic, powered by giant subsurface\nrollers, being carried from the spaceport to the main academy\nadministration building, the great gleaming Tower of Galileo.\n\nSpace Academy, the university of the planets, was set among the low\nhills of the western part of the North American continent. Here, in the\nnest of fledgling spacemen, boys from Earth and the colonies of Venus\nand Mars learned the complex science that would enable them to reach\nunlimited heights; to rocket through the endless void of space and visit\nnew worlds on distant planets millions of miles from Earth.\n\nThis was the year 2353--the age of space! A time when boys dreamed only\nof becoming Space Cadets at Space Academy, to learn their trade and\nlater enter the mighty Solar Guard, or join the rapidly expanding\nmerchant space service that sent out great fleets of rocket ships daily\nto every corner of the solar system.\n\nAs the slidewalk carried the three cadets between the buildings that\nsurrounded the grassy quadrangle of the Academy, Tom looked up at the\nTower of Galileo dominating the entire area.\n\n\"You know,\" he began haltingly, \"every time I go near this place I get a\nlump in my throat!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" breathed Astro, \"me too.\"\n\nRoger made no comment. His eyes were following the path of the giant\ntelescope reflector that moved in a slow arc, getting into position for\nthe coming night's observations. Tom followed his gaze to the massive\ndomed building, housing the giant one-thousand-inch reflector.\n\n\"You think we'll ever go as far into the deep with a rocket ship as we\ncan see with the big eye?\" he asked.\n\n\"I dunno,\" replied Roger. \"That thing can penetrate other star systems\nin our galaxy. And that's a long way off!\"\n\n\"Nearest thing to us is Alpha Centauri in our own galaxy, and that's\ntwenty-three and a half million million miles away,\" commented Astro.\n\n\"That's not so far,\" argued Tom. \"Only a few months ago the Solar\nAlliance sent out a scientific exploration to take a look at that baby.\"\n\n\"Musta been some hop,\" commented Roger.\n\n\"Hey!\" cried Tom suddenly. \"There's Alfie Higgins!\" He pointed in the\ndirection of another slidewalk moving at right angles to their own. The\ncadet that he singled out on the slidewalk was so thin and small he\nlooked emaciated. He wore glasses and at the moment was absorbed in a\npaper he held in his hand.\n\n\"Well, what do you know!\" cried Astro. \"The Brain!\"\n\nRoger punched Astro in the mid-section. \"If you were as smart as he is,\nyou big grease monkey, you'd be O.K.\"\n\n\"Nah!\" replied Astro. \"If I was as smart as Alfie, I'd be scared. And\nbesides, what do I need to be smart for? I've got you, haven't I?\"\n\nWhen they drew near the other slidewalk, the three members of the\n_Polaris_ unit skipped lightly over and jostled their way past other\nriders to the slightly built cadet.\n\n\"Alfie!\" Tom yelled and slapped the cadet on the back. Alfie turned, his\nglasses knocked askew by Tom's blow, and eyed the three _Polaris_\nmembers calmly.\n\n\"It gives me great pleasure to view your countenances again, Cadets\nCorbett, Manning, and Astro,\" he said solemnly, nodding to each one.\n\nAstro twisted his face into a grimace. \"What'd he say, Roger?\"\n\n\"He's happy to see you,\" Roger translated.\n\n\"Well, in that case,\" beamed Astro, \"I'm happy to see you too, Alfie!\"\n\n\"What's the latest space dope around the Academy, Alfie?\" asked Tom.\n\"What's this?\" he indicated the paper in Alfie's hand.\n\n\"By the sheerest of coincidences I happen to have a copy of your new\nassignment!\" replied Alfie.\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro looked at each other in surprise.\n\n\"Well, come on, spaceman,\" urged Roger. \"Give us the inside info. Where\nare we going?\"\n\nAlfie tucked the paper in his inside pocket and faced Roger. He cleared\nhis throat and spoke in measured tones. \"Manning, I have high regard for\nyour personality, your capabilities, and your knowledge, all of which\nmakes you an outstanding cadet. But even you know that I occupy a\nposition of trust as cadet courier for Commander Walters and the\nadministrative staff. I am not at liberty to mention anything that I\nwould have occasion to observe while in the presence of Commander\nWalters or the staff. Therefore, you will please refrain from\nquestioning me any further regarding the contents of these papers!\"\n\nRoger's jaw dropped. \"Why, you human calculator, you were the one who\nbrought it up in the first place! I oughta knock off that big head of\nyours!\"\n\nTom and Astro laughed.\n\n\"Lay off, Roger,\" said Tom. \"You ought to know Alfie couldn't talk if he\nwanted to! We'll just have to wait until Captain Strong is ready to tell\nus what our next assignment will be!\"\n\nBy this time the slidewalk had carried them to the front of the main\ndormitory, and the wide doors were crowded with members of the Space\nAcademy Corps heading in for the evening meal. From all corners of the\nquadrangle, the slidewalks carried Earthworms in their green uniforms,\nupper-class cadets in deep blue, enlisted spacemen in scarlet red, and\nSolar Guard officers in their striking uniforms of black and gold.\nChatting and laughing, they all were entering the great building.\n\nThe _Polaris_ unit was well known among other cadet units, and they were\ngreeted heartily from all sides. As Astro and Roger joked with various\ncadet units, forming up in front of the slidestairs leading down to the\nmess halls, Alfie turned to take a slidestairs going up. Suddenly he\nstopped, grabbed Tom by the shoulders, and whispered in his ear. Just as\nabruptly he turned and raced up the ascending slidestairs.\n\n\"What was that about?\" asked Roger, as Tom stood staring after the\nlittle cadet.\n\n\"Roger--he--he said our next assignment would be one of the great\nexperiments in space history. Something to be done that--that hasn't\never been done before!\"\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" said Astro. \"What do you suppose it is?\"\n\n\"Ahhh,\" sneered Roger, \"I'll bet it's nothing more than taking some\nguinea pigs to see how they react to Jovian gravity. That's never been\ndone before either! Why can't we get something exciting for a change?\"\n\nTom laughed. \"Come on, you bloodthirsty adventurer, I'm starved!\"\n\nBut Tom knew that Alfie Higgins didn't get excited easily, and his eyes\nwere wide and his voice trembled when he had whispered his secret to\nTom.\n\nThe _Polaris_ unit was due to embark on a great new adventure!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\n\"All O.K. here on the relay circuit,\" yelled Astro through the intercom\nfrom the power deck.\n\n\"O.K.,\" answered Tom. \"Now try out the automatic blowers for the main\ntubes!\"\n\n\"Wanta give me a little juice for the radar antenna, Astro?\" called\nRoger from the radar deck.\n\n\"In a minute, Manning, in a minute,\" growled Astro. \"Only got two hands,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"You should learn to use your feet,\" quipped Roger. \"Any normal Venusian\ncan do just as much with his toes as he can with his fingers!\"\n\nBack and forth the bantering had gone for twelve hours, while the three\nmembers of the _Polaris_ unit tested, checked, adjusted, and rechecked\nthe many different circuits, relays, junction boxes, and terminals in\nthe miles of delicate wiring woven through the ship. Now, as dawn began\nto creep pink and gray over the eastern horizon, they made their\nlast-minute search through the cavernous spaceship for any doubtful\nconnections. Satisfied there were none, the three weary cadets assembled\non the control deck and sipped the hot tea that Manning had thoughtfully\nprepared.\n\n[Illustration: _The three weary cadets assembled on the control deck_]\n\n\"You know, by the time we get out of the Academy I don't think there'll\nbe a single _inch_ of this space wagon that I haven't inspected with my\nnose,\" commented Roger in a tired voice.\n\n\"You know you love it, Manning,\" said Astro, who, though as tired as Tom\nand Roger, could still continue to work if necessary. His love for the\nmighty atomic rocket motors, and his ability to repair anything\nmechanical, was already a legend around the Academy. He cared for the\npower deck of the _Polaris_ as if it were a baby.\n\n\"Might as well pack in and grab some sleep before we report to Captain\nStrong,\" said Tom. \"He might have us blasting off right away, and I, for\none, would like to sleep and sleep and then sleep some more!\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about what Alfie had to say,\" said Roger. \"You know,\nabout this being a great adventure.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Well, you don't give this kind of overhaul for just a plain, short hop\nupstairs.\"\n\n\"You think it might be something deeper?\" asked Astro softly.\n\n\"Whatever it is,\" said Tom, getting up, \"we'll need sleep.\" He rose,\nstretched, and walked wearily to the exit port. Astro and Roger followed\nhim out, and once again they boarded the slidewalk for the trip back to\nthe main dormitory and their quarters on the forty-second floor. A half\nhour later the three members of the _Polaris_ were sound asleep.\n\n\nEarly morning found Captain Steve Strong in his quarters, standing at\nthe window and staring blankly out over the quadrangle. In his left hand\nhe clutched a sheaf of papers. He had just reread, for the fifth time, a\npetition for reinstatement of space papers for Al Mason and Bill Loring.\nIt wasn't easy, as Strong well knew, to deprive a man of his right to\nblast off and rocket through space, and the papers in question, issued\nonly by the Solar Guard, comprised the only legal license to blast off.\n\nOriginally issued as a means of preventing overzealous Earthmen from\nblasting off without the proper training or necessary physical\ncondition, which resulted in many deaths, space papers had gradually\nbecome the only effective means of controlling the vast expanding force\nof men who made space flight their life's work. With the establishment\nof the Spaceman's Code a hundred years before, firm rules and\nregulations for space flight had been instituted. Disobedience to any\npart of the code was punishable by suspension of papers and forfeiture\nof the right to blast off.\n\nOne of these rules stated that a spaceman was forbidden to blast off\nwithout authorization or clearance for a free orbit from a central\ntraffic control. Bill Loring and Al Mason were guilty of having broken\nthe regulation. Members of the crew of the recent expedition to Tara, a\nplanet in orbit around the sun star Alpha Centauri, they had taken a\nrocket scout and blasted off without permission from Major Connel, the\ncommander of the mission, who, in this case, was authorized\ntraffic-control officer. Connel had recommended immediate suspension of\ntheir space papers. Mason and Loring had petitioned for a review, and,\nto assure impartial judgment, Commander Walters had sent the petition to\none of his other officers to make a decision. The petition had landed on\nStrong's desk.\n\nStrong read the petition again and shook his head. The facts were too\nclear. There had been flagrant disregard for the rules and there was no\nevidence to support the suspended spacemen's charge that they had been\nunjustly accused by Connel. Strong's duty was clear. He had to uphold\nMajor Connel's action and suspend the men for a year.\n\nOnce the decision was made, Strong put the problem out of his mind. He\nwalked to his huge circular desk and began sorting through the day's\norders and reports. On the top of the pile of papers was a sealed\nenvelope, bordered in red and marked \"classified.\" It was from\nCommander Walters' office. Thoughtfully he opened it and read:\n\n     To: CAPTAIN STEVE STRONG: Cadet Supervisor,\n     _Polaris_ Unit\n     Upon receipt of this communication, you are ordered to\n     transfer the supervisory authority of the cadet unit\n     designated as _POLARIS_ unit; i.e., Cadets Tom Corbett, Roger\n     Manning, and Astro, and the command of the rocket cruiser\n     _Polaris_, to the command and supervisory authority of Major\n     Connel for execution of mission as outlined herein:\n\n     1. To test range, life, and general performance of audio\n     communications transmitter, type X21.\n\n     2. To test the above-mentioned transmitter under conditions of\n     deep space flight.\n\n     3. This test to take place on the planet Tara, Alpha Centauri.\n\n     This communication and all subsequent information relative to\n     above-mentioned mission shall be classified as _topmost\n     secret_.\n\n           Signed: WALTERS,\n                    _Commandant_, Space Academy\n\n\"So that's it,\" he thought. \"A hop into deep space for the _Polaris_\nunit!\" He smiled. \"The cadets of the _Polaris_ unit are in for a little\nsurprise in two ways,\" he thought. \"One from the mission and one from\nMajor Connel!\"\n\nHe almost laughed out loud as he turned to the small desk teleceiver at\nhis elbow. He pressed a button immediately below the screen and it\nglowed into life to reveal a young man in the uniform of the enlisted\nguard.\n\n\"Yes, Captain Strong?\" he asked.\n\n\"Call the cadets of the _Polaris_ unit,\" Strong ordered. \"Have them\nreport to me here on the double!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n\nStrong started to turn the set off, but the enlisted man added, \"By the\nway, sir, Al Mason and Bill Loring are here to see you.\"\n\n\"Oh--well--\" Strong hesitated.\n\n\"They're quite anxious to know if you've reached any decision regarding\ntheir petition for reinstatement.\"\n\n\"Mmm--yes, of course. Very well, send them in.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n\nThe teleceiver screen blackened. In a moment the door opposite Strong's\ndesk slid back, and Loring and Mason stepped into the office. They\nshambled forward and stopped in front of the huge desk, obviously ill at\nease.\n\nStrong stood up, holding their petition in his hand, and glanced over it\nbriefly even though he knew its contents by heart. He motioned to\nnear-by chairs. \"Sit down, please,\" he said.\n\nThe two spacemen settled themselves uncomfortably on the edge of their\nchairs and waited expectantly as Strong continued to look at the paper.\n\nLoring finally broke the heavy silence.\n\n\"Well, Captain Strong, have you made a decision?\" he asked. Loring was a\nheavy-set man, in his middle forties. He needed a shave, and when he\ntalked, his mouth twisted into an ugly grimace.\n\n\"Hope it's in our favor, sir,\" suggested Mason. He was shorter than\nLoring and, seated, his feet hardly reached the floor. His eyes darted\nnervously about the huge room, and he kept rolling a dirty black\nspaceman's cap in his hands.\n\n\"Yes, I've reached a decision,\" said Strong slowly. He faced the two men\nand looked at both of them with a steady cold stare. \"I've decided to\nsustain Major Connel's action. You are both grounded for the next twelve\nmonths. Earth months!\"\n\n\"What?\" shouted Loring, jumping to his feet. He banged his fist down on\nthe desk and leaned over, his face close to Strong's. \"You can't do that\nto us!\"\n\nCaptain Strong didn't move. \"I can,\" he said coldly. \"And I have.\"\n\n\"But--but--\" Mason began to whine. \"But space flight is all we know! How\nwill we live?\"\n\nStrong sat down and leaned back in his chair to get away from the foul\nodor of Loring's breath. He stared at the two men.\n\n\"You should have thought of that before you stole a rocket scout from\nthe expedition and made an unauthorized flight while on Tara,\" Strong\nreplied. \"You're lucky you're not accused, tried, and convicted of theft\nof a Solar Guard spaceship!\"\n\n\"We had permission to take that flight,\" snarled Loring. \"That Major\nConnel is so blasted space happy he forgot he gave us permission. Then\nwhen we came back, he slapped us in the brig!\"\n\n\"Do you have any proof of that?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"No! But it's our word against his!\" He slammed his hat down on the desk\nand shook his finger in Strong's face. \"You haven't any right to take\naway our papers just on the say-so of a lousy Solar Guard officer who\nthinks he's king of the universe!\"\n\n\"Take your filthy hat off my desk, Loring!\" barked Strong. \"And watch\nyour language!\"\n\nLoring realized he had made a mistake and tried to backtrack. \"Well, I\napologize for that. But I _don't_ apologize for saying he thinks he's--\"\n\n\"Major Connel has been in the Solar Guard for thirty years,\" said Strong\nemphatically. \"He's been awarded the Solar Medal three times. No other\nliving spaceman has achieved that! Not even Commander Walters! He rose\nthrough the ranks of the enlisted Solar Guard and was commissioned as an\nofficer of the Solar Guard in space during an emergency. He qualifies\nhigher than any other spaceman, and he has never been found to be\nunjust! He's one of the finest spacemen ever to hit the wide, deep, and\nhigh!\" Strong stopped, choked for breath, and turned away. It wasn't\noften he lost his temper, but something had to be said in defense of his\nfellow officer, and particularly since that officer was Connel. He\nturned back to face the two spacemen, and his voice was hard and cold\nagain.\n\n\"You are hereby suspended from space flight for twelve Earth months. Any\nfurther petition for appeal of this decision will be denied!\"\n\n\"All right! All right, Mr. Big!\" snapped Loring. \"Does this mean we\ncan't even ride as passengers?\"\n\n\"No rights under the Universal Bill of Rights of the Solar Alliance have\nbeen denied you, except that of actively participating in the flight of\na spaceship!\"\n\nThe signal bell of the teleceiver began to chime softly, and on the desk\nthe teleceiver screen glowed again. \"Cadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro\nare here for their assignments, sir,\" announced the enlisted man\noutside.\n\nLoring glared at Strong. \"I suppose you're going to send some punk kids\nout on the next trip to Tara and leave us experienced spacemen to rot on\nthe ground, huh?\"\n\nStrong didn't see the door slide open to admit the three cadets who\nentered quietly. His whole attention was focused on the ugly glaring\nfaces of Bill Loring and Al Mason.\n\n\"Get this, Loring!\" snapped Strong hotly. \"The assignments of the\n_Polaris_ unit, whether it be to Tara or the Moon, has nothing to do\nwith your own breech of conduct. In any case, if they were to be\nassigned, they'd do a better job than you 'experienced' spacemen who are\ndisrespectful of your superior officers and break regulations! If either\nof you makes one more crack about the Solar Guard or Space Cadets, or\n_anything_ at all, I'll take you out on the quadrangle and pound some\ncommon courtesy into your heads! Now get out!\"\n\n\"All right, all right--\" muttered Loring retreating, but with a sneer on\nhis lips. \"We'll meet again, Mr. Bigshot Spaceman!\"\n\n\"I hope so, Loring. And if we do, I hope you've taken a bath. You even\nsmell bad!\"\n\nFrom the rear of the room came a burst of laughter. Tom, Roger, and\nAstro, unobserved, had been listening and watching their skipper in\naction. When Loring and Mason had left the room, they advanced to the\ndesk, came to attention, and saluted.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting for duty, sir!\" snapped Tom crisply.\n\n\"At ease,\" said Strong. \"Did you hear all of that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, skipper!\" Roger smiled. \"And believe me, you really gave it\nto those two space bums!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Astro, \"but I don't think even _you_ could do much for\nLoring. He's just born to smell bad!\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" said Strong. \"I suppose you heard the part about the\nassignments?\"\n\nThe three cadets assumed looks of pure innocence.\n\n\"We didn't hear a thing, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"You'll make a fine diplomat, Corbett,\" Strong laughed. \"All right, sit\ndown and I'll give it to you straight.\"\n\nThey hastily took seats and waited for their skipper to begin.\n\n\"You've been assigned as cadet observers on a mission to test the range\nof a new long-range audio transmitter.\" Strong paused, then added\nsignificantly, \"The test is to take place in deep space.\"\n\nThe three cadets only beamed their enthusiastic approval.\n\n\"Tara,\" continued Strong, \"is your destination--a planet like Earth in\nmany respects, in orbit around the sun star Alpha Centauri. You'll take\nthe _Polaris_ directly to the Venus space station, where the transmitter\nhas been given primary tests, outfit the _Polaris_ for hyperdrive, and\nblast off!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" interrupted Tom, \"but you say 'you'?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" replied Strong, \"_you_, in the sense that I won't be going\nalong with you. Oh, don't worry!\" said Strong, holding up his hand as a\nsudden look of anticipation spread over the faces of the three boys.\n\"You're not going alone! You'll have a commanding officer, all right. In\nfact, you'll have the nearest thing to the perfect commanding officer in\nthe Solar Guard!\" He waited just long enough for each boy to search his\nmind for a suitable candidate and then added, \"Your skipper will be\nMajor Connel!\"\n\n\"Major Connel!\" the three cadets cried in unison.\n\n\"You mean Major 'Blast-off' Connel?\" uttered Roger unbelievingly.\n\n\"That's who I mean,\" said Strong. \"It's the best thing in the universe\nthat could happen to you!\"\n\nRoger stood up and saluted smartly. \"I request permission to be\ndismissed from this mission on the grounds of incompatibility, sir,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Incompatible to what?\" asked Strong, amused.\n\n\"To Major Connel, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Permission denied,\" said Strong with a smile. \"Buck up! It isn't so\nbad.\" Strong paused and stood up. \"Well, that's it. It's close to eleven\nA.M. and you're to report to the major at eleven on the nose. I\nhope you've got the _Polaris_ in good shape.\"\n\n\"We were up all night, sir,\" said Tom. \"She's ready to go.\"\n\n\"She's in better shape than we are,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Very well, then. Report to Major Connel immediately. Your papers have\nbeen transferred, so all you have to do is report.\"\n\nStrong rounded the desk and shook hands with each cadet. \"This is an\nimportant mission, boys,\" he said soberly. \"See that you give Major\nConnel all the support I know you're capable of giving. He'll need it. I\ndoubt if I'll see you before you blast off, so this is it. Spaceman's\nluck to each of you!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"Well, looks like we're big boys now,\" said Tom, as the three cadets\nstrolled down the corridor away from Captain Strong's office. \"They\ndon't hand out secret and important missions to cadet units unless\nthey're really on the ball!\"\n\n\"But we've got Major 'Blast-off' Connel to educate,\" grumbled Roger.\n\n\"What do you mean 'educate'?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"You know he's the roughest officer in the Academy,\" replied the\nblond-haired cadet. \"He eats cadets for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nAnd then has an extra one for dessert. He isn't just tough--his hide's\nmade of armor plate. But I've got a hunch that if we play dumb at first,\nthen smarten up slowly, we can make him feel that he's done it for us.\nSo he'll be easier on us.\"\n\n\"Say, it's after eleven!\" exclaimed Tom. \"We'd better hurry!\"\n\nSuddenly, as if a rocket cruiser were blasting off in the corridors, a\nroar, deafening and powerful, filled their ears. And beneath its\nferocity there were four unmistakable words:\n\n\"_Polaris unit--staaaaaaaannnnnndddddd toooooo!_\"\n\nEvery muscle, every bone in their three bodies snapped to rigid\nattention simultaneously. Eyes straight, chins in, the cadets waited for\nwhatever calamity had befallen them. From behind came quick, heavy\nfootsteps. They drew closer until they passed alongside and then\nabruptly stopped. There, in front of them, stood the one and only Major\n\"Blast-off\" Connel!\n\nThough a few inches shorter than Astro, he was what Astro might become\nin thirty years, heavily muscular, with a barrel chest that filled the\ngold-and-black uniform tightly. He stood balanced on the balls of his\nsmall feet like a boxer, hands hanging loosely at his sides. A bulldog\nchin jutted out of his rough-hewn face as if it were going to snap off\nthe head of the nearest cadet. He towered over Tom and Roger, and though\nshorter than Astro, he made up for this by sheer force of personality.\nWhen he spoke, his voice was like a deep foghorn that had suddenly\nlearned the use of vowels.\n\n\"So this is the great _Polaris_ unit, eh?\" he bellowed. \"You're two\nminutes late!\"\n\nTom suddenly felt that he and his unit-mates were all alone in the\ncorridor with the major. He glanced to one side, then the other,\ncautiously, and saw it was empty. And for good reason! No one wanted to\nbe around when \"Blast-off\" Connel was blasting. Cadets, enlisted men,\nand even officers were not safe from his sudden outbursts. He drove\nhimself so hard that he became impatient with others who were not able\nto match his drive. It was not because of ego but rather to get the job\nat hand finished. More than once he had dressed down a captain of the\nSolar Guard in the same tone he used on a green Earthworm. It was legend\naround the Academy that once, believing he was right, he had broken into\nthe Council Chamber itself to argue his point. He won by a unanimous\ndecision. Nothing, but nothing, had been devised or thought of that\ncould stop \"Blast-off\" Connel. Every waking moment of his adult life had\nbeen spent in the pursuit of more and more knowledge about space, space\ntravel, and life on the other planets.\n\nNow, his wrath at fever pitch at their being tardy, he stood in front of\nthe cadets, turning his anger on Roger first.\n\n\"Your name's Manning, isn't it?\" he growled.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Father got a medal--used to be a Solar Guard officer?\"\n\n\"That's right, sir. He was killed in space.\"\n\n\"I know. He was a good man. _You'll_ never be the man he was, if you\nlive ten thousand years. But if you don't _try_ to be a better man than\nhe was, you won't live five minutes with me! Is that clear, Cadet\nManning?\"\n\n\"Very clear, sir!\" gulped Roger.\n\nConnel turned to Astro.\n\n\"And you're the home-grown atomic-rocket genius, Venusian style, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" choked Astro. \"I'm from Venus.\"\n\n\"Bucked rockets on the old chemical burners as a kid before entering the\nAcademy, eh?\" asked Connel. There was less than an inch and a half\nbetween Astro's face and Major Connel's jaw.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Astro, \"I was an enlisted man before coming to the\nAcademy.\"\n\n\"Well, get this, you rocket buster,\" roared Connel. \"I want a power deck\nthat will give me what I want, when I want it, or you'll be back in the\nranks again. Is that clear, Cadet Astro?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! Everything she's got, when you want it, sir.\"\n\n\"And I like to have a power deck clean enough to eat off the deck\nplates!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" stuttered Astro, growing more and more confused. \"You like\nto eat off the deck plates, sir!\"\n\n\"_By the craters of Luna, no!_ I don't like to eat off the deck plates,\n_but I want them clean enough to eat there if I want to!_\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Astro's voice was hardly above a whisper.\n\n\"And you're the tactical wizard that won the space maneuvers recently,\nsinglehanded, eh?\" asked Connel, bending down to face Tom.\n\n\"Our side won, sir. If that answers your question,\" replied Tom. He was\nas nervous as Roger and Astro, but he fought for control. He was\ndetermined not to be bullied.\n\n\"I didn't ask you who won!\" snapped Connel. \"But you're the one just the\nsame. Control-deck cadet, eh? Well, you work with me. On the control\ndeck there's only room for one brain, one decision, one answer. And when\nI'm on the control deck, that decision, answer, and brain will be mine!\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly, sir,\" said Tom tonelessly.\n\nConnel stepped back, fists on his hips, eying the three cadets. He had\nheard about their difficulty in fitting personalities together when they\nhad first arrived at Space Academy (as described in _Stand By for\nMars!_). And he had heard about their triumph over the Martian desert.\nHe was impressed with everything he had learned about them, but he knew\nthat he had a reputation for being tough and that this reputation\nusually brought out the best in cadets. Early in his long and brilliant\ncareer he had learned that his life depended on the courage and\ningenuity of his fellow spacemen. When he became an instructor at the\nAcademy, he had determined that no cadet would ever be anything but the\nbest, and that, when they blasted off in later years, they could be\ndepended on.\n\nHe looked at the three cadets and felt a tinge of excitement that did\nnot show on his scowling face. \"Yes,\" he thought, \"they'll make\nspacemen. It'll take a little time--but they're good material.\"\n\n\"_Now listen to this!_\" he bawled. \"We blast off for the Venus space\nstation in exactly thirty minutes. Get your gear aboard the _Polaris_\nand stand by to raise ship.\" He dropped his voice and pushed out his jaw\na little farther. \"This will be the toughest journey you'll ever make.\nYou'll either come back spacemen, or you'll come back nothing. I'm going\nto try my best to make it\"--he paused and added coldly--\"_nothing!_\nBecause if you can't take it from me, then you don't belong in space!\nUnit _dis_-missed!\"\n\nHe turned on his heel and disappeared up the slidestairs without another\nlook at the three rigid cadets.\n\n\"Yeah--we'll educate him, all right,\" said Astro softly, with a wink at\nTom. \"Make him think he's done everything for us.\"\n\n\"Ah, go blast your jets!\" snarled Roger after he had found his voice.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Tom. \"Let's get the _Polaris_ ready. And, fellows, I\nmean _ready_!\"\n\n\nBill Loring and Al Mason stood near the entrance to the control tower of\nthe Academy spaceport and watched the three cadets of the _Polaris_\nscramble into the giant rocket cruiser.\n\n\"Every time I think about that Connel kicking us out of space for twelve\nmonths I wanta pound his head in with a wrench!\" snarled Loring.\n\nMason snorted. \"Well, what's the use of hanging around here?\" he asked.\n\"That Connel wouldn't have us aboard the _Polaris_, even if we were\ncleared and had our papers. There ain't a thing we can do!\"\n\n\"Don't give up so easy. There's a fortune setting up there in\nspace--just waiting for me and you to come and take it. And no big-shot\nSolar Guard officer is going to keep me from getting it!\"\n\n\"Yeah--yeah,\" grumbled Mason, \"but what are you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"I'll show you what I'm going to do!\" said Loring. \"We're heading for\nVenusport.\"\n\n\"Venusport? By the moons of Jupiter, what are we going to do there?\"\n\n\"Get a free ride to Tara!\"\n\n\"But how? I only got a few hundred credits and you ain't got much more.\nThere ain't nobody going to go fifty billion miles on nothing!\"\n\nLoring's eyes followed the massive figure of Major Connel on the\nslidewalk as it swept across the spaceport field toward the _Polaris_.\n\"You just buy us a coupla seats on the next rocket to Venusport and stop\nasking stupid questions. When we see Major 'Blast-off' Connel again,\nwe'll be giving the orders with a paralo-ray!\"\n\nThe two disgruntled spacemen turned quickly and walked to the nearest\nslidewalk, disappearing around a building.\n\nAboard the _Polaris_, Tom confronted his two unit-mates.\n\n\"Now look, fellows. After the hard time Major Connel just gave us, let's\nsee if we can't really stay on the ball from now on.\"\n\n\"All right by me, Tom,\" Astro said, nodding his head.\n\n\"You're having space dreams, Corbett!\" drawled Roger. \"No matter what we\ndo for old 'Blast-off' we'll wind up behind the eight ball.\"\n\n\"But if we really try,\" urged Tom, \"if we all do our jobs, there can't\nbe anything for him to fuss about.\"\n\n\"We'll make it tough for him to give us any demerits,\" Astro chimed in.\n\n\"Right,\" said Tom.\n\n\"It won't work,\" grumbled Roger. \"You saw the way he chewed us up, and\nfor what? I ask you--for what?\"\n\n\"He was just trying to live up to his reputation, Roger,\" replied Tom.\n\"But common sense will tell you that if you're on the ball you won't get\ndemerits.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, hot-shot?\" growled Astro. \"Afraid of a little work?\"\n\n\"Listen, you Venusian clunk,\" sneered Roger, \"I'll work the pants off\nyou any day in the week, and that includes Titan days, too!\"\n\n\"O.K.\" Tom smiled. \"Save half of that energy for the _Polaris_, Roger.\"\n\n\"Yeah, use some of that Manning hot air to shine brass!\" suggested\nAstro.\n\n\"Come on. Let's get this wagon in shape,\" said Tom. He turned to the\ninstrument panel and the great control board.\n\nA moment later the three cadets were busy shining the few bits of brass\nand rechecking the many controls and levers. Suddenly there was the\nsound of a hatch slamming below and then Astro's voice came whispering\nover the intercom, \"... watch it, fellows. Here he comes!\"\n\nThe airtight hatch leading to the control deck slid back, and Major\nConnel stepped inside. With one sweeping glance he took in the control\ndeck and the evidence of their work.\n\n\"Unit--_staaaaand to!_\" he roared.\n\nAstro climbed into the control deck and snapped to attention with his\nunit-mates as Connel began a quick but thorough check of the many dials\nand switches and relays on the control panel.\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" he mused. \"Been doing a little work, I see.\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing special, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Well, from now on it's going to be special!\" roared Connel.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" acknowledged Roger quickly.\n\n\"All right, at ease,\" ordered Connel. As the three boys relaxed, Connel\nstepped over to the astrogation board and snapped a switch. Immediately\na solar chart filled the huge chart screen. It was a black-and-white\nview of the planet Venus.\n\n\"This is where we're going first,\" he said, placing a finger on a\nball-shaped satellite in orbit around the misty planet. \"This is the\nVenus space station. As you know, Venus has no natural satellite of its\nown, so we built one. We'll blast off from here and go directly to the\nspace station where the _Polaris_ will be fitted with hyperdrive for\ndeep-space operations. While at the station you will acquaint yourselves\nwith the operation of the new audio communications transmitter. When I'm\nsatisfied that you can handle it under the prevailing conditions of an\nextended space flight, we'll blast off for a test of its range and\nperformance.\"\n\nMajor Connel paused and faced the cadets squarely. Then he continued:\n\"This is an important mission--one which I hope will enable the Solar\nGuard to establish the first base outside of our solar system. Our\ndestination is Tara, in the star system of Alpha Centauri. Tara is a\nplanet in a stage of development similar to that of Earth several\nmillion years ago. Its climate is tropical, and lush vegetation--jungles\nreally--covers the land surface. Two great oceans separate the land\nmasses. One is called Alpha, the other Omega. I was on the first\nexpedition, when Tara was discovered, and have just returned from the\nsecond, during which we explored it and ran tests to learn if it could\nsustain human life. All tests show that Tara can be transformed into a\nparadise.\"\n\nConnel paused, took a deep breath, and continued: \"I shall expect more\nthan just hard work from you. I want everything you have to offer. Not\njust good performance, but _excellence_! I will not tolerate anything\nless, and if I'm forced to resort to extreme disciplinary action to get\nwhat I demand, then you can expect to receive every demerit in the\nbook!\" He stepped closer to the three cadets. \"Remember! Spacemen--or\n_nothing!_ Now, stand by to blast off!\"\n\nWithout a word, the three cadets hurried to their stations and began\nroutine procedure to raise ship.\n\n\"All departments ready to blast off, Major Connel,\" reported Tom,\nsaluting sharply.\n\n\"Very well, Corbett, proceed,\" said Connel.\n\nTom called into the intercom, \"Stand by for blast-off!\" He then opened\nthe circuit to the teleceiver screen overhead and spoke to the spaceport\ncontrol tower.\n\n\"_Polaris_ to spaceport control. Request permission to blast off.\nRequest orbit.\"\n\n\"Spaceport traffic to _Polaris_. Your orbit has been cleared 089--repeat\n089--blast off in two minutes ...\"\n\n\"Orbit 089--blast off minus one fifty-nine fifty-eight.\"\n\n\"You read me clear, _Polaris_ ...\"\n\nTom clicked off the switch and turned to the intercom. \"Control deck to\nradar bridge. Do we have a clear tangent forward and up?\"\n\n\"All clear forward and up, Tom,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Control deck to power deck. Energize the cooling pumps!\"\n\n\"Cooling pumps in operation,\" answered Astro briskly.\n\nThe giant ship began to shudder as the mighty pumps on the power deck\nstarted their slow, whining build-up. Tom sat in front of the control\npanel, strapped himself into the acceleration chair, and began checking\nthe dials and gauges. Satisfied everything was in order, he fastened his\neyes to the sweeping red second hand on the solar clock. The teleceiver\nscreen brought a sharp picture of the surrounding base of the spaceship,\nand he saw that it was all clear. The second hand reached the ten-second\nmark.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\" bawled Tom into the intercom. The red hand\nmoved steadily, surely, to the zero at the top of the clock face. Tom\nreached for the master switch.\n\n\"Blast off minus five--four--three--two--one--_zero!_\"\n\nTom threw the switch.\n\nSlowly the giant ship raised itself from the ground. Then faster and\nfaster, pushing the four spacemen deep into their acceleration cushions,\nit hurtled spaceward.\n\nIn a few seconds the _Polaris_ was gravity-free. Once again, Earthmen\nhad started another journey to the stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n\"Stand by to reduce speed three-quarters!\" roared Major Connel.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Tom, and began the necessary adjustments on the\ncontrol panel. He spoke into the intercom. \"Control deck to power deck.\nStand by to reduce thrust on main drive rockets by three-quarters. We're\ncoming onto the space station, Astro.\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye,\" acknowledged Astro.\n\nDrifting in a steady orbit around its mother planet, the Venus space\nstation loomed ahead of the _Polaris_ like a huge metal ball set against\na backdrop of cold, black space. It was studded with gaping holes, air\nlocks which served as landing ports for spaceships. Inside the station\nwas a compact city. Living quarters, communications rooms, repair shops,\nweather observations, meteor information, everything to serve the great\nfleet of Solar Guard and merchant spaceships plying the space lanes\nbetween Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan.\n\n\"I'm getting the identification request from the station, sir. Shall I\nanswer her?\" asked Roger over the intercom.\n\n\"Of course, you space-brained idiot, and make it fast!\" exploded Connel.\n\"What do you want to do? Get us blasted out of space?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied Roger. \"Right away, sir!\"\n\nTom kept his eyes on the teleceiver screen above his head. The image of\nthe space station loomed large and clear.\n\n\"Approaching a little too fast, I think, sir,\" volunteered Tom. \"Shall I\nmake the adjustment?\"\n\n\"What's the range?\" asked Connel.\n\nTom named a figure.\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" mused Connel. He glanced quickly over the dials and then\nnodded in assent. Tom turned once more to the intercom. \"Control deck to\npower deck,\" he called. \"Stand by for maneuvering, Astro, and reduce\nyour main drive thrust to minimum space speed.\"\n\n\"Space station traffic control to rocket cruiser _Polaris_. Come in,\n_Polaris_. This is traffic control on space station to _Polaris_,\" the\naudio teleceiver crackled.\n\n\"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to space station and traffic control. Request\ntouchdown permission and landing-port number,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Permission to touch down granted, _Polaris_. You are to line up on\napproach to landing-port seven--repeat--seven. Am now sending out\nguiding radar beam. Can you read beam?\"\n\nTom turned to the intercom. \"Have you got the station's guiding beam,\nRoger?\"\n\n\"All lined up, Tom,\" replied Roger from the radar bridge. \"Get that\nVenusian on the power deck to give me a three-second shot on the\nstarboard rocket, if he can find the right handles!\"\n\n\"I heard that, Manning!\" roared Astro's voice on the intercom. \"Another\ncrack like that and I'll make you get out and push this baby around!\"\n\n\"_You execute that order and do it blasted quick!_\" Major Connel's voice\nexploded over the intercom. \"And watch that loose talk on the ship's\nintercom. From now on, all directions and orders will be given and\nreceived in a crisp, clear manner without unnecessary familiarity!\"\n\nConnel didn't expect them to acknowledge his order. The cadets had heard\nhim and that was enough. He knew it was enough. In the short time it had\ntaken them to traverse the immense gulf of space between the Academy and\nthe station Connel had handed out demerits by fives and tens! Each of\nthe cadets was now tagged with enough black marks to spend two months in\nthe galley working them off!\n\nNow, working together like the smooth team of junior spacemen they were,\nTom, Roger, and Astro maneuvered the great rocket ship toward the gaping\nhole of the air lock in the side of the white ball-like satellite.\n\n\"Drop your bow one half degree, _Polaris_, you're up too high,\" warned\nthe station control.\n\n\"A short burst on the upper trim rocket, Astro,\" called Tom.\n\nThe great ship bucked slightly under the force of sudden thrust, and\nthen its nose dropped the required half degree.\n\n\"Cut all thrust and brake your speed to dead ship, _Polaris_,\" ordered\ntraffic control.\n\nAgain Tom relayed the order to Astro, and a moment later the great ship\nhung silently in the airless void of space, a scant half mile from the\nstation.\n\n[Illustration: _The junior spaceman maneuvered the great rocket ship\ntoward the air lock_]\n\nThrough the teleceiver Tom could see the jet boats darting out from the\nstation carrying the magnetic cables. In a moment the lines were\nattached to the steel skin of the ship, and gradually the lines\ntightened, pulling the mighty spaceship into the waiting port. Once\ninside, the outer air lock was closed and the _Polaris_ was slung in the\npowerful magnetic cradles that held her in a rigid position. Elsewhere\non the satellite, quick calculations were made for the additional\nweight, and the station was counterbalanced to assure an even orbit\naround Venus.\n\nTom flicked the many switches off on the great board, glanced at the\ntime of arrival on the solar clock, and reported to Major Connel.\n\n\"Touchdown at one-nine-four-nine, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" answered Connel. Then he added grudgingly, \"That\nwas as fine a job of control-deck operations as I've seen. Keep up the\ngood work, spaceman.\"\n\nTom gulped. The unexpected compliment caught him off guard. And he was\neven more pleased that for the first time Connel had referred to him as\nspaceman!\n\n\"I'll be needed at the space station commander's quarters for a while,\nCorbett,\" said Connel. \"Meanwhile, you and Manning and Astro acquaint\nyourselves with the station. Report to me back aboard the ship in\nexactly two hours. Dismissed.\"\n\nTom saluted, and Connel disappeared toward the exit port.\n\n\"Well, _spaceman_,\" Roger drawled casually from behind, \"it looks like\nyou've got yourself in solid with the old man!\"\n\nTom smiled. \"With a guy like that, Roger, you're never in solid. Maybe I\ndid get a pat on the back, but you didn't hear him cancel any of those\ndemerits he gave me for not signing the logbook after that last watch,\ndid you?\"\n\n\"Let's get some chow,\" growled Astro, who came hustling through the\nhatch. \"I'm half starved. By the craters of Luna, how many times can you\nchange course in five minutes?\"\n\nAstro referred to the countless times Tom had had to call for\nfraction-degree course changes in their approach to the gaping entrance\nport.\n\nTom laughed. \"With Connel on the bridge, you're lucky I didn't give you\ntwice as many,\" he replied. \"Can you imagine what would have happened if\nwe had missed and hit the station?\"\n\n\"Brrrrrr!\" shuddered Roger. \"I hate to think about it. Come on. Let's\nrustle up some grub for the Venusian. I could use some myself.\"\n\nThe three boys quickly changed to their dress blue cadet uniforms and\nleft the ship. A moment later they were being whisked up an electric\nelevator to the main--or \"street\"--level. The door opened, and they\nstepped out into a large circular area about the size of a city block in\nthe rear of the station. The area had been broken into smaller sections.\nOne side of the \"street\" was devoted to shops, a small stereo house\nwhich was playing the latest Liddy Tamal hit, \"Children of Space\" (a\nsensational drama about the lives of men in the future), restaurants,\nand even a curio shop. The Venus space station handled ninety per cent\nof the traffic into and out of Venusport. It was a refueling stop for\nthe jet liners and space freighters bound for the outer planets, and for\nthose returning to Earth. Some ships went directly to Venusport for\nheavy overhaul or supplies, but the station was established primarily\nfor quick turn arounds. Several ex-enlisted spacemen who had been\ninjured or retired were given special permission to open shops for the\nconvenience of the passengers and crews of the ships and the staff of\nthe station. In twenty years the station had become a place where summer\ntourists from Earth and winter tourists from Titan made a point of\nstopping. The first of its kind in the universe, it was as near a\nperfect place to live as could be built by man.\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro strolled down the short street, pushing through a\ncrowd of tourists admiring the shops. Finally they found a restaurant\nthat specialized in Venusian dishes.\n\n\"Now you two spindly Earthmen are going to have the best meal of your\nlives! Broiled dinosaur on real Venusian black bread!\"\n\n\"D-dinosaur!\" stuttered Tom in amazement. \"Why--why--that's a\nprehistoric monster!\"\n\n\"Yeah, Astro,\" agreed Roger. \"What are you trying to hand us?\"\n\nAstro laughed. \"You'll see, fellows,\" he replied. \"I used to go hunting\nfor them when I was a kid. Brought the best price of any wild game.\nFifty credits for babies under three hundred pounds. Over that, you\ncan't eat 'em. Too tough!\"\n\nTom and Roger looked at each other, eyes bulging.\n\n\"Ah, come on, Tom,\" drawled Roger. \"He's just trying to pull our leg.\"\n\nWithout a word, Astro grabbed them by the arms and rushed them into the\nrestaurant. They were no sooner seated when a recorded voice announced\nthe menu over a small loud-speaker on the table. Astro promptly ordered\ndinosaur, and to his unit-mates' amazement, the voice politely inquired:\n\n\"Would the spacemen prefer to have it broiled \u00e0 la Venusian black bread,\nbaked, or raw?\"\n\nA sharp look from Roger and Tom, and Astro ordered it broiled.\n\nOne hour and fifteen minutes later the three members of the _Polaris_\nunit staggered out of the restaurant.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" declared Tom, \"that wasn't only the most I\never ate--it was the best!\"\n\nRoger nodded in silent agreement, leaning against the plastic window in\nfront of the restaurant.\n\n\"You see,\" Astro beamed, \"maybe you guys will listen to me from now on!\"\n\n\"Boy, I can't wait to see Mom's face when I tell her that her chicken\nand dumplings have taken second place to broiled monster!\"\n\n\"By the jumping blazes of the stars!\" yelled Roger suddenly. \"Look at\nthe time! We're ten minutes late!\"\n\n\"Ohhhhh,\" moaned Tom. \"I knew it was too good to be true!\"\n\n\"Step on it!\" said Astro. \"Maybe he won't notice.\"\n\n\"Some chance,\" groaned Roger, running after Tom and Astro. \"That old\nrocket head wouldn't miss anything!\"\n\nThe three boys raced back to the electric elevator and were silently\nwhisked to the air-lock level. They hurried aboard the _Polaris_ and\ninto the control room. Major Connel was seated in a chair near the chart\nscreen, studying some papers. The cadets drew themselves to attention.\n\n\"Unit reporting for duty, sir,\" Tom quavered.\n\nConnel spun around in the swivel chair, glanced at the clock, put the\npapers to one side, and slowly advanced toward the cadets.\n\n\"Thirteen and a half minutes late!\" he said, dropping his voice to a\nbiting growl. \"I'll give you five seconds to think up a good excuse.\nEvery man is entitled to an excuse. Some have good ones, some have\ntruthful ones, and some have excuses that sound as though they made them\nup in five seconds!\"\n\nHe eyed the cadets speculatively. \"Well?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm afraid we were carried away by our enthusiasm for a meal Astro\nintroduced us to, sir,\" said Tom honestly.\n\n\"All right,\" snapped Connel, \"then here's something else to carry you\nall away!\" He paused and rocked on the balls of his feet. \"I had planned\nto give you three liberty of the station while here, whenever you\nweren't working on the new transmitter. But since you have shown\nyourselves to be carried away so easily, I don't think I can depend on\nyour completing your regular duties. Therefore, I suggest that each of\nyou report to the officer in charge of your respective departments and\nlearn the operation and function of the station while we're here. This\nwork will be _in addition_ to your assigned duties on the new\ntransmitter operation!\"\n\nThe three cadets gulped but were silent.\n\n\"Not only that,\" Connel's voice had risen to an angry bark, \"but you\nwill be logged a demerit apiece for each minute you reported late.\nThirteen and a half minutes, thirteen and a half demerits!\"\n\nThe gold and black of the Solar Guard uniform never looked more ominous\nas the three cadets watched the stern spaceman turn and stomp out the\nexit port.\n\nAlone, their liberty taken away from them before they even knew they had\nit, the boys sat around on the control deck of the silent ship and\nlistened to the distant throb of a pump, rising and falling, pumping\nfree air throughout the station.\n\n\"Well,\" sighed Tom, \"I always did want to know how a space station\nworked. Now I guess I'll learn firsthand.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" said Astro. He propped his big feet up on a delicate\ninstrument panel of the control board.\n\n\"Me, too!\" sneered Roger, his voice filled with a bitterness that\nsurprised Tom and Astro. \"But I didn't think I would find out like this!\nHow in the universe has that--that tyrant managed to stay alive this\nlong!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"The space station's biggest headache,\" said Terry Scott, a young Solar\nGuard officer assigned the job of showing the _Polaris_ crew around, \"is\nto maintain perfect balance at all times.\"\n\n\"How do you achieve that, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We create our own gravity by means of a giant gyroscope in the heart of\nthe station. When more weight is taken aboard, or weight leaves the\nstation, we have to adjust the gyro's speed.\"\n\nThey entered the power deck of the great ball-like satellite. Astro's\neyes glowed with pleasure as he glanced approvingly from one massive\nmachine to another. The fuel tanks were made of thin durable aluminite;\na huge cylinder, covered with heat-resistant paint, was the air\nconditioner; power came from a bank of atomic dynamos and generators;\nwhile those massive pumps kept the station's artificial air and water\nsupply circulating.\n\nDials, gauges, meters, were arrayed in seemingly endless rows--but each\none of them actually played its part in keeping the station in balance.\n\nAstro's face was one big, delighted grin.\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger with a sly wink at Tom, \"you can't tell me that\nConnel has made our Venusian unhappy. Even if he had given us liberty,\nI'll bet Astro would have spent it down here with the grease monkeys!\"\n\nAstro didn't rise to the bait. His attention was riveted on a huge\ndynamo, which he watched with appreciative eyes. But then Terry Scott\nintroduced the _Polaris_ unit to an older Solar Guard officer.\n\n\"Cadets, meet Captain Jenledge,\" said Scott. \"And, sir, this is Cadet\nAstro. Major Connel would like him to work with you while he's here.\"\n\n\"Glad to know you, boys,\" said Jenledge, \"and particularly you, Cadet\nAstro. I've heard about your handiness with the thrust buckets on the\ncruisers. What do you think of our layout?\"\n\nThe officer turned and waved his hand to indicate the power-deck\nequipment.\n\n\"This is just about the finest--the most terrif--\"\n\nThe officer smiled at Astro's inability to describe his feelings.\nJenledge was proud of his power deck, proud of the whole establishment,\nfor that matter. He had conceived it, had drawn the plans, and had\nconstructed this space station.\n\nThroughout the solar system it was considered his baby. And when he had\nasked for permission to remain on as senior power-deck chief, the Solar\nAlliance had jumped at the chance to keep such a good man on the job.\nThe station had become a sort of postgraduate course for power-deck\ncadets and junior Solar Guard officers.\n\nAstro beamed. So, the great Jenledge had actually heard of him--of\nhumble Cadet Astro. He could hardly restrain himself from ripping off\nhis blue uniform and going right to work on a near-by machine that had\nbeen torn apart for repairs. Finally he managed to gasp, \"I think it's\ngreat, sir--just wonderful!\"\n\n\"Very well, Cadet Astro,\" said the officer. \"There's a pair of\ncoveralls in my locker. You can start right to work.\" He paused and his\neyes twinkled. \"If you want to, that is!\"\n\n\"Want to!\" roared Astro, and was off to the locker room.\n\nJenledge turned to Scott. \"Leave him with me, Scotty. I don't think\nCadet Astro's going to care much about the rest of the station!\"\n\nScott smiled, saluted, and walked away. Tom and Roger came to attention,\nsaluted, and followed the young officer off the power deck.\n\n\"Astro's probably happier now than he'll ever be in his life, Tom,\"\nwhispered Roger.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Tom. \"Did you see the way his eyes lit up when we walked\nin there? Like a kid with a brand-new toy!\"\n\nA moment later Scott, Tom, and Roger, in a vacuum elevator, were being\nhurtled to the station's upper decks. They got out on the observation\ndeck, and Scott walked directly to a small door at the end of a\ncorridor. A light over the door flashed red and Scott stopped.\n\n\"Here's the weather and meteor observation room,\" he said. \"Also radar\ncommunications. When the red light's on, it means photographs are being\ntaken. We'll have to wait for them to finish.\"\n\nAs they waited, Tom and Roger talked to Scott. He had graduated from\nSpace Academy seven years before, they learned. He'd been assigned to\nthe Solar Alliance Chamber as liaison between the Chamber and the Solar\nGuard. After four years, he had requested a transfer to active space\noperations.\n\nThen, he told them, there'd been an accident. His ship exploded. He'd\nbeen badly injured--in fact, both his legs were now artificial.\n\nThe cadets, who had thought him a bit stuffy at first, were changing\ntheir minds fast. Why hadn't he quit, they wanted to know?\n\n\"Leave space?\" said Scott. \"I'd rather die. I can't blast off any more.\nBut here at the station I'm still a spaceman.\"\n\nThe red light went out, and they opened the door.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the bustle and noise on the power deck, the meteor,\nweather, and radar observation room was filled with only a subdued\nwhisper. All around them huge screens displayed various views of the\nsurface of Venus as it slowly revolved beneath the station. Along one\nside of the room was a solid bank of four-foot-square teleceiver screens\nwith an enlisted spaceman or junior officer seated in front of each one.\nThese men, at their microphones, were relaying meteor and weather\ninformation to all parts of the solar system. Now it was Roger's turn to\nget excited at seeing the wonderful radar scanners that swept space for\nhundreds of thousands of miles. They were powerful enough to pick up a\nspaceship's identifying outline while still two hundred thousand miles\naway! Farther to one side, a single teleceiver screen, ten feet square,\ndominated the room. Roger gasped.\n\nScott smiled. \"That's the largest teleceiver screen in the universe,\" he\nsaid. \"The most powerful. And it's showing you a picture of the\nAndromeda Galaxy, thousands of light years away. Most of the lights you\nsee there are no more than that, just light, their stars, or suns,\nhaving long ago exploded or burned. But the light continues to travel,\ntaking thousands of years to reach our solar system.\"\n\n\"But--but--\" gasped Tom. \"How can you be so accurate with this screen?\nIt looks as though we were smack in the center of the galaxy itself!\"\n\n\"There's a fifty-inch telescope attached to the screen,\" Scott replied,\n\"which is equal to the big one-thousand-inch 'eye' back at the Academy.\"\n\n\"Why is that, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"You don't get any distortion from atmosphere up here,\" replied the\nyoung officer.\n\nAs Tom and Roger walked silently among the men at the teleceiver\nscreens, Scott continued to explain. \"This is where you'll be, Manning,\"\nhe said, indicating a large radarscope scanner a little to one side and\npartially hidden from the glow of the huge teleceiver screen. \"We need a\nman on watch here twenty-four hours a day, though there isn't much doing\nbetween midnight and eight A.M. on radar watch. A little\ntraffic, but nothing compared to what we get during the regular working\nday.\"\n\n\"Any particular reason for that, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Oh, there just aren't many arrivals and departures during that period.\nWe have night crews to handle light traffic, but by midnight the station\nis pretty much like any sleepy Middle Western town. Rolls up the\nsidewalks and goes to bed.\"\n\nHe motioned to Roger to follow him to the radar section and left Tom\nwatching the interesting spectacle on the giant teleceiver. A huge star\ncluster flashed brilliantly, filling the screen with light, then faded\ninto the endless blackness of space. Tom caught his breath as he\nremembered what Scott had told him about the light being thousands of\nyears old before reaching the solar system.\n\n\"Manning's all set, Corbett,\" said Scott at Tom's elbow. \"Come on. I'll\nshow you the traffic-control deck.\"\n\nTom followed the young officer out of the room. As all true spacemen do\nat one time or another in their lives, he thought about the pitifully\nsmall part mankind had played so far in the conquest of the stars. Man\nhad come a long way, Tom was ready to admit, but there was still a lot\nof work ahead for young, courageous spacemen.\n\nAs Scott and Tom climbed the narrow stairs to the traffic-control deck,\nthe Solar Guard officer continued to speak of the man-made satellite.\n\"When the station was first built,\" he said, \"it was expected to be just\na way station for refueling and celestial observations. But now we're\nfinding other uses for it, just as though it were a small community on\nEarth, Mars, or Venus. In fact, they're now planning to build still\nlarger stations.\" Scott opened the door to the traffic-control room. He\nmotioned to Tom to follow him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis room, Tom was ready to admit, was the busiest place he had ever\nseen in his life. All around the circular room enlisted Solar Guardsmen\nsat at small desks, each with a monitoring board in front of him holding\nthree teleceiver screens. As he talked into a mike near by, each man, by\nshifting from one screen to the next, was able to follow the progress of\na spaceship into or out of the landing ports. One thing puzzled Tom. He\nturned to Scott.\n\n\"Sir, how come some of those screens show the _station_ from the\n_outside_?\" he asked. Tom pointed to a screen in front of him that had a\npicture of a huge jet liner just entering a landing port.\n\n\"Two-way teleceivers, Corbett,\" said Scott with a smile. \"When you\narrived on the _Polaris_, didn't you have a view of the station on your\nteleceiver?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Tom, \"of course.\"\n\n\"Well, these monitors picked up your image on the _Polaris_ teleceiver.\nSo the traffic-control chief here could see exactly what you were\nseeing.\"\n\nIn the center of the circular room Tom noticed a round desk that was\nraised about eight feet from the floor. This desk dominated all activity\nin the busy room. Inside it stood a Solar Guard officer, watching the\nmonitoring teleceivers. He wore a throat microphone for sending out\nmessages, and for receiving calls had a thin silver wire running to the\nvibrating bone in his ear. He moved constantly, turning in a circle,\nwatching the various landing ports on the many screens.\nThree-thousand-ton rocket liners, Solar Guard cruisers, scout ships, and\ndestroyers all moved about the satellite lazily, waiting for permission\nto enter or depart. This man was the master traffic-control officer who\nhad first contacted Tom on his approach to the station. He did that for\nall approaching ships--contacted them, got the recognition signal,\nfound out the ship's destination, its weight, and its cargo or passenger\nload.\n\nThen the connection was relayed to one of the secondary control officers\nat the monitoring boards.\n\n\"That's Captain Stefens,\" said Scott in a whisper. \"Toughest officer on\nthe station. He has to be. From five hundred to a thousand ships arrive\nand depart daily. It's his job to see that every arriving ship is\nproperly taken into the landing ports. Besides that, everything you've\nseen, except the meteor and weather observation rooms, are under his\ncommand. If he thinks a ship is overloaded, he won't allow it to enter\nand disrupt the balance of the station. Instead, he'll order its skipper\nto dump part of his cargo out in space to be picked up later. He makes\nhundreds of decisions a day--some of them really hair-raising. Once,\nwhen a rocket scout crew was threatened with exploding reactant mass, he\ncalmly told them to blast off into a desolate spot in space and blow up.\nThe crew could have abandoned ship, but they chose to remain with it and\nwere blown to atoms. It could have happened to the station. That night\nhe got a three-day pass from the station and went to Venusport.\"\n\nScott shook his head. \"I've heard Venusport will never be the same after\nthat three-day pass of Captain Stefens.\"\n\nThe young officer looked at Corbett quizzically. \"That's the man you're\ngoing to work for.\"\n\nScott walked over to the circular desk and spoke rapidly to the officer\ninside. As Tom approached, Stefens gave him a quick, sharp glance. It\nsent a shiver down the cadet's spine. Scott waved to him to come over.\n\n\"Captain Stefens, this is Cadet Tom Corbett.\"\n\nTom came to attention.\n\n\"All right, Corbett,\" said Stefens, speaking like a man who had a lot\nto do, knew how to do it, liked to do it, and was losing time. \"Stand up\nhere with me and keep your mouth shut. Remember any questions you want\nto ask, and when I have a spare moment, ask them. And by the rings of\nSaturn, be sure I'm free to answer. Take my attention at the wrong\nmoment and we could have a bad accident.\"\n\nStefens gave Scott a fleeting smile and turned back to his constant\nkeen-eyed inspection of the monitors.\n\nThe radar watch was reporting the approach of a ship. Stefens began his\ncold, precise orders.\n\n\"Monitor seven, take freighter out of station on port sixty-six; monitor\ntwelve, stand by for identification signal of jet liner coming in from\nMars. Watch her closely. The Venusport Space Line is overloading again....\"\nOn and on he went, with Tom standing to one side watching with\nwide-eyed wonder as the many ships were maneuvered into and out of the\nstation.\n\nSuddenly Stefens turned to Tom. \"Well, Corbett,\" he rasped, \"what's the\nfirst question?\"\n\nTom gulped. He had been so fascinated by the room's sheer magic and by\nStefens' sure control of the traffic that he hadn't had a chance to\nthink.\n\n\"I--I--don't have one--yet, sir,\" he managed finally.\n\n\"I want five questions within five minutes!\" snapped Stefens, \"and they\nbetter be rocket-blasting _good questions_!\" He turned back to the\nmonitors.\n\nTom Corbett, while he had gained the respect of many elder spacemen, was\ndiscovering that a cadet's life got no easier as time went on. He\nwondered fleetingly how Roger and Astro were making out, and then he\nbegan to think of some questions.\n\nBeside him, oblivious of his presence, Stefens continued to spout\ndirections. \"Monitor three, take rocket scout out of landing-port\neight. One crew member is remaining aboard the station for medical\ntreatment. He weighs one hundred and fifty-eight pounds. Make balance\nadjustments accordingly....\"\n\nTom's head was spinning. It was all too much for one young cadet to\nabsorb on such short notice.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n\"There goes the jet liner to Mars,\" said Al Mason wistfully. \"Sure wish\nwe wuz on her.\" His eyes followed the beautiful slim passenger ship just\nblasting off from Venus.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Loring.\n\n\"Anything to get away from Venusport. What a stinking hole!\" snorted the\nshorter of the two spacemen.\n\n\"For what we want to do,\" said Loring, \"there ain't another city in the\nsystem that's got the advantages this place has!\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me about advantages,\" whined Mason. \"Be darned if I can\nsee any. All we been doing is hang around the spaceport, talk to the\nspacemen, and watch the ships blast off. Maybe you're up to something\nbut I'm blasted if I see what it can be.\"\n\n\"I've been looking for the right break to come along.\"\n\n\"What kind of break?\" growled Mason.\n\n\"That kind,\" said Loring. He pointed to a distant figure emerging from a\nspace freighter. \"There's our answer!\" said Loring, a note of triumph in\nhis voice. \"Come on. Let's get outta here. I don't want to be\nrecognized.\"\n\n\"But--but--what's up? What's that guy and the space freighter _Annie\nJones_ got to do with us?\"\n\nLoring didn't answer but stepped quickly to the nearest jet cab and\nhopped into the back seat. Mason tumbled in after him.\n\n\"Spaceman's Row,\" Loring directed, \"and make it quick!\"\n\nThe driver stepped on the accelerator and the red teardrop-shaped\nvehicle shot away from the curb into the crowd of cars racing along\nPremier Highway Number One. In the back seat of the jet cab, Loring\nturned to his spacemate and slapped him on the back.\n\n\"Soon's we get into the Row, you go and pack our gear, see! Then meet me\nat the Caf\u00e9 Cosmos in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Pack our gear?\" asked Mason with alarm. \"Are we going some place?\"\n\nLoring shot a glance at the driver. \"Just do as I tell you!\" he growled.\n\"In a few hours we'll be on our way to Tara, and then--\" He dropped his\nvoice to a whisper. Mason listened and smiled.\n\nThe jet cab slid along the arrow-straight highway toward the heart of\nthe city of Venusport. Soon it reached the outskirts. On both sides of\nthe highway rose low, flat-roofed dwellings, built on a revolving wheel\nto follow the precious sun, and constructed of pure Titan crystal.\nFarther ahead and looming magnificent in the late afternoon sun was the\nfirst and largest of Venusian cities, Venusport. Like a fantastically\nlarge diamond, the startling towers of the young city shot upward into\nthe misty atmosphere, catching the light and reflecting it in every\ncolor of the spectrum.\n\nLoring and Mason did not appreciate the beauty of the city as they rode\nswiftly through the busy streets. Loring, in particular, thought as he\nhad never thought before. He was busily putting a plot together in his\nmind--a plot as dangerous as it was criminal.\n\n[Illustration: _The jet cab raced along the highway to Venusport_]\n\nThe jet cab slammed to a stop at a busy intersection of the city. This\nwas Spaceman's Row, and it dated back to Venusport's first rough and\ntough pioneering days.\n\nFor two blocks on either side of the street, in building after building,\ncaf\u00e9s, pawnshops, cheap restaurants above and below the street level,\nsupplied the needs of countless shadowy figures who came and went as\nsilently as ghosts. Spaceman's Row was where suspended spacemen and\nspace rats, prospectors of the asteroids for uranium and pitchblende,\ngathered and found short-lived and rowdy fun. Here, skippers of rocket\nships, bound for destinations in deep space, could find hands willing to\nsign on their dirty freighters despite low pay and poor working\nconditions. No questions were asked here. Along Spaceman's Row, hard men\nplayed a grim game of survival.\n\nLoring and Mason paid the driver, got out, and walked down the busy\nstreet. Here and there, nuaniam signs began to flick on, their garish\nblues, reds, and whites bathing the street in a glow of synthetic light.\nIt was early evening, but already Spaceman's Row was getting ready for\nthe coming night.\n\nPresently, Mason left Loring, climbing up a long narrow flight of stairs\nleading to a dingy back hall bedroom to pack their few remaining bits of\ngear.\n\nLoring walked on amid the noise and laughter that echoed from cheap\nrestaurants and saloons. Stopping before Caf\u00e9 Cosmos, he surveyed the\nstreet quickly before entering the wide doors. Many years before, the\nCosmos had been a sedate dining spot, a place where respectable family\nparties came to enjoy good food and the gentle breezes of a near-by\nlake. Now, with the lake polluted by industry and with the gradual\ninflux of shiftless spacemen, the Cosmos had been given over to the most\nbasic, simple need of its new patrons--rocket juice!\n\nThe large room that Loring entered still retained some of the features\nof its more genteel beginnings, but the huge blaring teleceiver screen\nwas filled with the pouting face of a popular singer. He advanced to the\nbar that occupied one entire wall.\n\n\"Rocket juice!\" he said, slamming down his fist on the wooden bar.\n\"Double!\" He was served a glass of the harsh bluish liquid, paid his\ncredits, and downed the drink. Then he turned slowly and glanced around\nthe half-filled room. Almost immediately he spotted a small wizened man\nlimping toward him.\n\n\"Been waiting for you,\" said the man.\n\n\"Well,\" demanded Loring, \"did'ja get anything set up, Shinny?\"\n\n\"_Mr._ Shinny!\" growled the little man, with surprising vigor. \"I'm old\nenough to be your father!\"\n\n\"Awright--awright--_Mr._ Shinny!\" sneered Loring. \"Did'ja get it?\"\n\nThe little man shook his head. \"Nothing on the market, Billy boy.\" He\npaused and aimed a stream of tobacco juice at a near-by cuspidor.\n\nLoring looked relieved. \"Just as well. I've got something else lined up,\nanyway.\"\n\nShinny's eyes sharpened. \"You must have a pretty big strike, Billy boy,\nif you're so hot to buy a spaceship!\"\n\n\"Only want to take a little ride upstairs, _Mr._ Shinny,\" said Loring.\n\n\"Don't hand me that space gas!\" snapped Shinny. \"A man who's lost his\nspace papers ain't going to take a chance at getting caught by the Solar\nGuard, busting the void with a rocket ship and no papers.\" He stopped,\nand his small gray eyes twinkled. \"_Unless_,\" he added, \"you've got\nquite a strike lined up!\"\n\n\"Hey, Loring!\" yelled Mason, entering the caf\u00e9. He carried two\nspaceman's traveling bags, small black plastic containers with glass\nzippers.\n\n\"So you've got Al Mason in with you,\" mused Shinny. \"Pretty good man,\nAl. Let's see now, I saw you two just before you blasted off for Tara!\"\nHe paused. \"Couldn't be that you've got anything lined up in deep space,\nnow could it?\"\n\n\"You're an old fool!\" snarled Loring.\n\n\"Heh--heh--heh,\" chuckled Shinny. A toothless smile spread across his\nwrinkled face. \"Coming close, am I?\"\n\nAl Mason looked at Shinny and back at Loring. \"Say! What is this?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"O.K., O.K.,\" said Loring between clenched teeth. \"So we've got a strike\nout in the deep, but one word outta line from you and I'll blast you\nwith my heater!\"\n\n\"Not a word,\" said Shinny, \"not a word. I'll only charge you a little to\nkeep your secret.\"\n\nMason looked at Loring. \"How much?\" he demanded.\n\n\"A twentieth of the take,\" said Shinny. \"And that's dirt cheap.\"\n\n\"It's robbery,\" said Loring, \"but O.K. We've got no choice!\"\n\n\"Loring, wait a minute!\" objected Mason. \"One twentieth! Why, that could\nadd up to a million credits!\"\n\nShinny's eyes opened wide. \"Twenty million! Hey, there hasn't been a\nuranium strike that big since the old seventeenth moon of Jupiter back\nin 2294!\"\n\nLoring motioned to them to sit down at a table. He ordered a bottle of\nrocket juice and filled three glasses.\n\n\"This ain't uranium, _Mr._ Shinny!\" he said.\n\nShinny's eyes opened wider still. \"What then?\"\n\n\"What's the most precious metal in the system today?\" Loring asked.\n\n\"Why--gold, I guess.\"\n\n\"Next to gold?\"\n\nShinny thought for a moment. \"Couldn't be silver any more, since\nthey're making the artificial stuff cheaper'n it costs to mine it.\" The\nlittle man's jaw dropped and he stared at Loring. \"You mean--?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Loring, \"copper!\"\n\nShinny's mind raced. In this year of 2353, all major copper deposits had\nlong since been exhausted and only small new deposits were being found,\nnot nearly enough for the needs of the expanding system. In an age of\nelectronics, lack of copper had become a serious bottleneck in the\nproduction of electrical and scientific equipment. Search parties were\nout constantly, all over the solar system, trying to find more of the\nprecious stuff. So a deposit of the kind Loring and Mason were talking\nabout was a prize indeed.\n\nShinny's greedy fingers twitched with anticipation.\n\n\"So that's why you want to buy a spaceship, eh?\"\n\n\"Wanted,\" replied Loring. \"I don't want to buy one now. The way things\nlook, we'll get what we want for nothing!\"\n\nMason, who had been sitting quietly, suddenly jumped up. \"So that's your\nangle! Well, I don't want any part of it,\" he shouted.\n\nLoring and Shinny looked up in surprise.\n\n\"What're you talking about?\" demanded Loring.\n\n\"All of a sudden it's come to me. Now I know why you've been hanging\naround the spaceport for the last two weeks. And what you meant when you\nsaw the spaceman get out of that freighter today!\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" barked Loring. \"If you weren't so dumb, you'd have caught on\nlong ago.\" He eyed the shorter man from between half-closed lids. \"It's\nthe only way we can get out of here!\"\n\n\"Not me. I ain't pulling anything like that!\" whined Mason.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" demanded Shinny. \"What're you two space bums\ntalking about?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what! He's going to try--\"\n\nLoring suddenly stood up and slapped the shorter spaceman across the\nmouth. Mason sat down, a dazed look on his face.\n\n\"You space-crawling rat!\" hissed Loring. \"You'll do what I tell you to\ndo, see?\"\n\n\"Yeah--yeah, sure,\" bleated Mason. \"O.K. Anything you say. Anything.\"\n\n\"What is this?\" demanded Shinny.\n\n\"You shut up!\" growled Loring.\n\n\"I won't!\" said Shinny, as he also rose from the table. \"You may be\ntough, Billy Loring, but not as tough as me!\"\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Finally Loring smiled and\npatted Mason's shoulder. \"Sorry, Al. I guess I got a little hot for a\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Quit talking riddles,\" pleaded Shinny. \"What's this all about?\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Loring.\n\nThey sank back into their chairs.\n\n\"It's simple,\" said Mason fearfully. \"Loring wants to steal a\nspaceship.\"\n\n\"A pirate job!\" said Shinny. He drew in his breath sharply. \"You must be\noutta your mind!\"\n\n\"You've called yourself in on this,\" Loring reminded him. \"And you're\nstaying in.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Shinny's voice dropped to a husky, frightened whisper. \"Deal's\noff. I ain't gonna spend the rest of my life on a prison asteroid!\"\n\n\"Shinny, you know too much!\" Loring's hand darted toward the blaster he\nwore at his belt.\n\n\"Your secret's safe with me. I give you my spaceman's word on it,\" said\nShinny, pushing back his chair. Abruptly getting to his feet, he\nscrambled rapidly out the door of the Caf\u00e9 Cosmos.\n\n\"Loring,\" said Mason, \"get him. You can't let him ...\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" shot back the other. \"He won't break his spaceman's oath.\nNot Shinny.\" He got up. \"Come on, Mason. We haven't got much time before\nthe _Annie Jones_ blasts off.\"\n\n\"What are we gonna do?\" the shorter man wanted to know.\n\n\"Stow away on the cargo deck. Then, when we get out into space, we dump\nthe pilots and head for Tara, for our first load of copper.\"\n\n\"But a job like this'll take money!\"\n\n\"We'll make enough to go ahead on the first load.\"\n\nMason began to get up, hesitated, and then sat down again.\n\n\"Come on,\" snapped Loring. His hand dropped toward his belt. \"I'm going\nto make you rich, Mason,\" he said quietly. \"I'm going to make you one of\nthe richest men in the universe--even if I have to kill you first.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\"Space freighter _Antares_ from Venus space station. Your approach\ncourse is one-nine-seven--corrected. Reduce speed to minimum thrust and\napproach spaceport nine--landing-deck three. End transmission!\"\n\nTom stood on the dais of the traffic-control room and switched the\n_Antares_ beam to one of his assistants at the monitors in the control\nroom. In less than two weeks he had mastered the difficult\ntraffic-control procedure to the point where Captain Stefens had allowed\nhim to handle the midnight shift. He checked the monitors and turned to\nsee Roger walk through the door.\n\n\"Working hard, Junior?\" asked Roger in his casual drawl.\n\n\"Roger!\" exclaimed Tom. \"What are you fooling around down here for?\"\n\n\"Ah, there's nothing to do on the radar deck. Besides, I've got the\nemergency alarm on.\" He wiped his forehead. \"Brother! Of all the crummy\nplaces to be stuck!\"\n\n\"Could be worse,\" said Tom, his eyes sweeping the monitors.\n\n\"Nothing could be worse,\" groaned Roger. \"But nothing. Think of that\nlovely space doll Helen Ashton alone on earth--and me stuck here on a\nspace station.\"\n\n\"Well, we're doing an important job, Roger,\" replied Tom. \"And doing it\nwell, or Major Connel wouldn't leave us alone so much. How're you making\nout with the new equipment?\"\n\n\"That toy?\" sneered Roger. \"I gave it a look, checked the circuits once,\nand knew it inside out. It's so simple a child could have built one!\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" scoffed Tom. \"That's why the top scientists worked for years\non something small, compact, powerful enough to reach through deep\nspace--and still be easy to repair.\"\n\n\"Quit heckling me, Junior,\" retorted Roger, \"I'm thinking. Trying to\nfigure out some way of getting to the teleceiver set on board the\n_Polaris_.\"\n\n\"Why can't you get on the _Polaris_?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"They're jazzing up the power deck with a new hyperdrive unit for the\nbig hop to Tara. So many guys buzzing around you can't get near it.\"\n\n\"What do you need a teleceiver for?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"To give me company,\" replied Roger sourly. \"Say!\" He snapped his\nfingers suddenly. \"Maybe if I just changed the frequency--\"\n\n\"What frequency? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Spaceboy, I'm getting a real hot-rocket idea! See ya later!\" And the\nblond cadet ran for the door.\n\nTom watched his unit-mate disappear and shook his head in amused\ndespair. Roger, he told himself, might be difficult, but he was\ncertainly never dull.\n\nThen his attention was brought back to the monitors by the warning of\nanother approaching spaceship.\n\n\"... jet liner _San Francisco_ to Venus space-station traffic control\n...\" the metallic voice crackled over the speaker.\n\n\"Jet liner _San Francisco_, this is Venus space-station traffic\ncontrol,\" replied Tom. \"You are cleared for landing at port\neleven--repeat--eleven. Make standard check for approach orbit to\nstation landing. End transmission!\"\n\nFrom one side of the circular dais, Tom saw Major Connel enter the room.\nHe snapped to attention and saluted smartly.\n\n\"Morning, Corbett,\" said Connel, returning Tom's salute. \"Getting into\nthe swing of the operation?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"I've handled about twenty approaches since\nCaptain Stefens left me alone, and about fifty departures.\" Tom brought\nhis fist up, with the thumb extended and wiped it across his chest in\nthe traditional spaceman's signal that all was clear. \"I didn't scratch\none of 'em, sir,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\"Good enough,\" said Connel. \"Keep it that way.\" He watched the monitor\nscreen as the liner _San Francisco_ settled into landing-port eleven.\n\nWhen she was cradled and secure, he grunted his satisfaction and turned\nto leave. At the door he suddenly paused. \"By the way, isn't Manning on\nradar watch?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Well, it's one forty-eight. How about his standard check-in with\ntraffic control?\"\n\nTom stammered, \"He--uh--he may be plotting some space junk, sir.\"\n\n\"He _still_ must report, regardless of what he's doing!\"\n\n\"I--uh--ah--yes, sir!\" gulped Tom. Blast Roger anyway, he thought,\nforgetting the all-important quarter-hour check-in.\n\n\"I'd better go up and find out if anything's wrong,\" said Connel.\n\n\"Gosh, sir,\" suggested Tom, desperately seeking an excuse for his\nshipmate. \"I'm sure Roger would have notified us if anything had\nhappened.\"\n\n\"Knowing Manning as I do, I'm not so sure!\" And the irascible officer\nthundered through the door like a jet-propelled tank!\n\n\n\"Come on, Mason. Hurry and put on that space suit,\" barked Loring.\n\n\"Take it easy,\" grumbled Mason. \"I'm working as fast as I can!\"\n\n\"Of all the rotten luck,\" growled Loring. \"Who'd ever figure the _Annie\nJones_ would blast off from Venus--and then stop at the space station!\"\n\n\"Shows you ain't so smart,\" retorted Mason. \"Lots of ships do that. They\ncarry just enough fuel to get 'em off the surface, so they'll be light\nwhile they're blasting out of Venus' gravity. Then they stop at the\nspace station to refuel for the long haul.\"\n\n\"All right,\" barked Loring, \"lay off the lecture! Just get that space\nsuit on in a hurry!\"\n\n\"Listen, wise guy,\" challenged Mason, \"just tell me one thing. If we\nbail out of this tub in space suits, who's going to pick us up?\"\n\n\"We're not bailing out!\" said Loring.\n\n\"We're not? Then what are we suiting up for?\"\n\n\"Just in case,\" said Loring. \"Now listen to me. In a few minutes the\n_Annie Jones_'ll make contact with traffic control. Only instead of\ntalking to the pilot--they'll be talking to us. Because we'll have taken\nover.\"\n\n\"But unless we land they'll be suspicious. And if we land ...\"\n\nLoring interrupted. \"Nobody's going to suspect a thing. I'll tell\ntraffic control we've got an extra-heavy load. Then they won't let us\nland. We follow their orders and blast off into space--find an emergency\nfuel station--head for Tara--and nobody suspects anything.\"\n\nMason twisted his face into a scowl. \"Sounds awful risky to me,\" he\nmuttered.\n\n\"Sure it's risky,\" sneered Loring, \"but you don't hit the jackpot\nwithout ever taking a _chance_!\"\n\nThe two men, huddled against a jumble of packing cases in the cargo hold\nof the _Annie Jones_, made careful preparations. Checking their weapons,\nthey opened their way toward the freighter's control deck. Just outside\nthe hatch they stopped, paralo-ray guns ready, and listened.\n\nInside, Pilot James Jardine and Leland Bangs, his first officer, were\npreparing for the landing at the space station.\n\n\"Ought to be picking up the approach radar signal pretty soon,\" said\nBangs. \"Better take her off automatic control, Jardine. Use the manual\nfor close maneuvering.\"\n\n\"Right,\" answered his spacemate. \"Send out a radar blip for them to pick\nup. I'll check the cargo and make sure it's lashed down for landing.\nCaptain Stefens is tough when it comes to being shipshape.\"\n\nThe freighter blasted evenly, smoothly onward through the darkness of\nspace in a straight line for the man-made satellite. Jardine got up from\nthe freighter's dual-control board, picked up a portable light, and\nheaded for the hatch leading to the cargo deck.\n\n\"He's coming,\" hissed Loring. \"We'll take him soon's he reaches us.\"\nThere was a sharp clank as the hatch opened, and Jardine's head came\ninto view.\n\n\"Now!\" yelled Loring. He swung the heavy paralo-ray gun at Jardine's\nhead.\n\n\"What the--\" exclaimed the startled spaceman. \"Bangs, look out!\"\n\nHe tried to avoid the blow, but Loring's gun landed on the side of his\nhead. Jardine crumpled to the deck.\n\nBangs was out of his seat in a moment, at his pilot's call. The burly\nredheaded spaceman saw at a glance what was wrong and lunged for the\nhatch.\n\nLoring stepped toward him, holding his paralo-ray.\n\n\"All right, spaceboy!\" he grated. \"Hold it or I'll freeze you stiff!\"\n\nBangs stopped and stared at the gun and at Jardine who was slumped on\nthe deck. Mason rushed past him to the controls.\n\n\"What is this?\" demanded Bangs.\n\n\"An old game,\" explained Loring with a sneer. \"It's called 'You've got\nit and I take it.' And if you don't like it, you get it.\" He gestured\nwith his gun. \"You get it--with this.\"\n\nBangs nodded. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"O.K. But how about letting me take care\nof my buddy. He's hurt.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Just a bump on the head,\" said Loring. \"He'll come out of it soon\nenough.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" shouted Mason, \"I can't figure out these controls!\"\n\nLoring growled angrily. \"Here, lemme at them!\" He forced Bangs to lie\ndown on the deck, and then, keeping the gun trained on the redheaded\nspaceman, stepped quickly to the control board. He handed Mason the gun.\n\n\"Keep an eye on them while I figure this baby out.\"\n\n\"Least you coulda done is steal a decent ship,\" grumbled Mason. \"This\ntub is so old it creaks!\"\n\n\"Just shut your mouth and keep your eye on those guys,\" said the other.\nHe began to mutter to himself as he tried to figure out the complicated\ncontrols.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJardine was now conscious but had the presence of mind not to move. His\nhead ached from the blow. Slowly he opened his eyes and saw his two\nattackers bending over the board. He saw that Bangs was lying on the\ndeck facing him. Jardine winked at Bangs, who returned the signal. Then\nhe began, carefully, methodically to send a Morse-code message to his\ncompanion via his winking eyes.\n\n\"O-N-L-Y--one--gun--between--them. You--take--big--fellow.\nI'll--charge--gun ...\"\n\n\"Can't you figure this thing out either?\" asked Mason, leaning over\nLoring's shoulder.\n\n\"Ah, this wagon is an old converted chemical burner. These controls are\nold as the sun. I've got to find the automatic pilot!\"\n\n\"Try that lever over there,\" suggested Mason.\n\nLoring reached over to grasp it, turning away from his prisoners.\n\n\"Bangs, get 'em!\" shouted Jardine. The two men jumped to their feet and\nlunged at Loring and Mason. Loring dove to one side, losing the gun in\nthe scramble, but as he fell, he reached for the acceleration control\nlever. He wrenched it out of its socket and brought it down on Bang's\nhead, and the officer slid to the floor. Jardine, meanwhile, had Mason\nin a viselike grip, but again Loring used the lever, bringing it down\nhard on the neck of the freighter pilot. Jardine dropped to the deck.\n\n\"Thanks, Loring,\" gasped Mason. \"That was close! Good thing we had on\nthese space suits, or we'd have been finished. They couldn't grab onto\nthe smooth plastic.\"\n\n\"Finished is right!\" snarled Loring. \"I told you to keep an eye on them!\nIf they'd nabbed us we woulda wound up on the prison asteroid!\"\n\n\"Loring,\" shouted Mason, \"look!\" He pointed a trembling finger at the\nthrust indicator. \"We're blasting at full space speed--right for the\nstation!\"\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" cried Loring, \"I must've jammed the thrust\nwhen I yanked the lever out of the control board!\"\n\n\"Put it back! Slow this ship down!\" cried Mason, his face ashen with\nfear. Loring jumped to the control board and with trembling fingers\ntried to replace the lever in the socket.\n\n\"I can't--can't--\" he panted. \"We gotta pile outta here! We're heading\nfor the station. We'll crash!\"\n\n\"Come on! This way! We left the space helmets back in the cargo hold!\"\nshouted Mason. He ran toward the open hatch leading to the companionway.\nSuddenly he stopped. \"Hey, what about those two guys?\"\n\n\"Never mind them!\" shouted Loring. \"Keep going. We can't do anything for\nthem now!\"\n\nAnd as the two men raced toward the stern, the freighter, her powerful\nrockets wide open, arrowed straight toward the gleaming white structure\nof the space station.\n\n\n\"It was easy, honey,\" cooed Roger into the microphone on the main\ncontrol panel of the space-station radar bridge.\n\n\"I switched the frequency on the station, beamed to a teleceiver trunk\nline on Earth, and called you up, my little space pet! Smart, huh? Now\nremember we have a date as soon as I get back from this important and\nsecret mission. I could've got out of it, but they needed me badly. As\nmuch as I like you, baby, I had to go along to give the boys a break and\n...\"\n\n\"_Cadet Manning!_\" An infuriated roar echoed in the small chamber.\n\n\"Yeah, whaddaya wan--\" growled Roger, turning to see who had interrupted\nhim. He suddenly gulped and turned pale. \"Ohhhhhhhhh--good-by, baby!\" He\nflipped the switch and stood up.\n\n\"Uh--ah--good morning, Major Connel,\" he stammered.\n\n\"What's going on here, Manning?\" barked Connel.\n\n\"I--was--talking, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"So I heard! But talking to whom?\"\n\n\"To whom, sir?\"\n\n\"That's what I said, Manning.\" Connel's voice dropped to a deep\nsarcastic purr. \"To whom?\"\n\n\"I was--ah--talking to Earth, sir.\"\n\n\"Official business, I presume?\"\n\n\"You mean--official--like here on the station, sir?\"\n\n\"Official, like here on the station, Manning,\" replied Connel in almost\na kindly tone.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You failed to make your quarter-hour check to the traffic-control\ncenter, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" gulped Roger. The full realization of what he had done was\nbeginning to dawn on him.\n\n\"And you've tampered with vital station equipment for your own personal\nuse,\" added Connel. With a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach,\nRoger noticed the major was strangely quiet in his interrogation. It\nfelt like the calm before the storm.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" admitted Roger, \"I changed several circuits.\"\n\n\"Are you aware of the seriousness of your negligence, Manning?\" Connel's\nvoice began to harden.\n\n\"Yes--yes--I guess so, sir,\" stumbled Roger.\n\n\"Can you repair that radar so that it can be used as it was intended?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Then do so immediately. There are ships in flight depending on your\ninformation and signals.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger quietly. Then he added quickly, \"I'd like the\nmajor to know, sir, that this is the first time this has happened.\"\n\n\"I have only your word for that, Manning!\" Connel finally began blasting\nin his all too familiar roar. \"Since you've done it once, I see no\nreason to think you couldn't have done it before or that you might not\ndo it again!\" The officer's face was now almost purple with rage. \"When\nyou've repaired that set, return to your quarters! You are confined\nuntil I decide on disciplinary action!\"\n\nTurning abruptly, Connel stormed out of the room, slamming the hatch\nclosed behind him.\n\nWith a sigh Roger turned back to the set. With trembling fingers he\nreconnected the terminals and made delicate adjustments on the many\ndials. Finally, as power began to flow through the proper chain of\ncircuits, the radar scanner glowed into life and the hair-thin line of\nlight swept around the dull green surface of the scope. It had been left\non a setting covering two hundred miles around the space station, and\nseeing the area was clear, Roger increased the range to five hundred\nmiles. The resulting scan sent a sudden chill down his spine. A\nspaceship was roaring toward the station at full thrust!\n\nCold sweat beaded Roger's forehead as he grabbed for the microphone and\ncalled Tom.\n\n\"Radar bridge to control deck!\" The words tumbled out frantically. \"Tom!\nTom! There's a ship heading right for the station! Bearing 098! Distance\n450 miles! Coming in on full thrust! Tom, acknowledge! Quick!\"\n\nDown on the control deck, Tom had been watching a space freighter easing\nout of the station when Roger's voice came over the speaker in a thin\nscream.\n\n\"What?\" he yelled. \"Give me that again, Roger!\"\n\n\"Spaceship bearing 098--full thrust! Range now four twenty-five!\"\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" shouted Tom, \"why didn't you pick her up\nsooner, Roger?\"\n\n\"Never mind that. Contact that guy and tell him to change course! He\ncan't brake in time now!\"\n\n\"All right! Sign off!\" Without waiting for a reply, Tom cut Roger off\nand switched to a standard space band. His voice quivering, the young\ncadet spoke quickly and urgently into the microphone. \"Space station to\nspaceship approaching on orbit 098. Change course! Emergency! Reduce\nthrust and change course or you will crash into us!\"\n\nAs he spoke, Tom watched the master screen of his scanner and saw the\nship rocketing closer and closer with no change in speed or course. He\nrealized that any action, even now, would bring the craft dangerously\nclose to the station. Without hesitation, he flipped on the master\nswitch of the central station communicator, opening every loud-speaker\non the station to his voice.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is traffic-control center! Emergency!\nRepeat. Emergency! All personnel in and near landing ports five, six,\nseven, eight, and nine--decks A, B, and C--evacuate immediately to\nopposite side of the station. Emergency crews stand by for crash!\nSpaceship heading for station! May crash! Emergency--emergency!\"\n\nOn the endangered decks, men began to move quickly, and in a moment the\ngreat man-made satellite was prepared for disaster. On the control\ndeck, Tom stayed at his station, sounding the warning.\n\n\"Emergency! Emergency! All personnel prepare for crash! All personnel\nprepare for crash!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"There--there!\" shouted Captain Stefens into the mike aboard the jet\nboat circling around the station. \"I think I see something bearing about\nseventy degrees to my left and up about twenty on the ecliptic! Do you\nsee it, Scotty?\"\n\nTom, in the bucket seat of the jet boat, strained his eyes but was\nunable to see over the control board.\n\nTerry Scott, in a second jet boat ten miles away, answered quickly,\n\"Yes, I think I see it, sir.\"\n\n\"Good!\" shouted Stefens. \"Maybe we've found something.\"\n\nHe spoke to Tom over his shoulder, keeping his eye on the floating\nobjects in the black void of space. \"Come to the starboard about\none-quarter full turn, Corbett, and hold it. Then up, about twenty-five\ndegrees.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Tom. He began to maneuver the small gnat-sized\nspace craft to the proper position.\n\n\"That's good!\" shouted Stefens. \"Now hold that. Let me see. I think\nwe've hit pay dirt.\"\n\nFrom the right, Tom could see the red flash of the rockets of Terry\nScott's jet boat, which Astro had volunteered to pilot, coming into\nview. As soon as order had been restored aboard the station, search\nparties had been sent out to look for survivors.\n\nCarefully Tom slowed the space craft in response to Stefens' brief\ncommands and soon came to a dead halt in space. There, hovering right\nabove them, visible through the crystal dome of the jet boat, Tom could\nsee two space-suited figures floating effortlessly. A moment later\nScott's craft came alongside, and the two small ships were lashed\ntogether with magnetic lines. Tom and Stefens hurriedly pulled on their\nspace helmets. They adjusted the valves regulating the oxygen supply in\ntheir suits, and Stefens slipped back the sliding top of the jet boat.\nOut on the hull he secured a line to a projecting ring, and ordering Tom\nto stand by, he pushed himself off the ship into the bottomless void of\nspace.\n\nThe line trailing behind him, Stefens drifted toward the two helpless\nfigures. He reached them in less than a minute, secured the line to\ntheir belts, and signaled Tom to haul in.\n\nNear by, Terry Scott and Astro watched as the three figures were pulled\nto safety.\n\nQuickly the top of the jet boat was closed, oxygen pressure in the craft\nwas restored, and the four men took off their helmets.\n\n\"Whew!\" said Loring. \"I sure want to thank you for pulling us out of the\ndeep!\"\n\n\"We sure do, sir!\" added Mason. Then, with a quick look at Loring, he\nasked softly, \"Were there any other survivors?\"\n\nStefens' face was grim. \"Not one. After we untangled the mess, we found\nbodies of two men. It was pretty bad. A little later something was\nspotted on the radar, and we hoped there might be survivors. Luckily for\nyou, we came to look!\"\n\n[Illustration: _Tom could see two space-suited figures floating\neffortlessly_]\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" swore Loring softly, \"Jardine and Bangs were\nbrave men. They practically forced us to pile out when they saw they\nwere going to crack up.\" He turned to Mason. \"Didn't they, Al?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, sure brave men,\" Al Mason agreed.\n\n\"Nothing to be done for them now, of course,\" said Stefens. \"What\nhappened?\" He paused, and then added, \"You don't have to tell me if you\ndon't want to before you make out your report, but I'd sure like to\nknow.\"\n\n\"I don't really know what happened, sir,\" said Loring. \"We had made a\ndeal for a ride back to Earth with Jardine and were sleeping back on the\ncargo deck. All of a sudden, Jardine came running in. Told us we were\nabout to pile into the station and for us to suit up and get out. We\nasked him about himself, but he said he was going to stay and try to\nsave the ship. We piled out, and--well, we saw the whole thing from out\nhere. Like a big splash of light. It must have been pretty bad on the\nstation, eh?\"\n\n\"Plenty bad, but thanks to Cadet Corbett here, there wasn't a single\ninjury. He warned everybody to get off that side of the station. A lot\nof damage but no casualties.\"\n\n\"Don't you have any idea what made the ship crash?\" asked Tom quietly.\n\nLoring looked at Tom but spoke to Stefens. \"I told you all I know, sir.\nCan I expect to be questioned by everyone in the Solar Guard. Including\ncadets?\"\n\nStefens bristled. \"It was a civil question, Loring,\" he said stiffly,\n\"but you don't have to say anything if you don't want to!\"\n\nLoring and Mason had not expected such a strong defense of the cadet,\nand Loring was quick to make amends. \"I'm sorry--I guess I'm still a\nbit shaken up,\" he muttered.\n\nStefens grunted.\n\n\"It wasn't pretty, you know, watching that ship go up and not be able to\ndo anything about it,\" Loring continued plaintively. \"Jardine and\nBangs--well, they're--they _were_ sorta friends of mine.\"\n\nThey were silent all the way back to the station, each with his own\nthoughts--Stefens puzzling over the cause of the crash, Loring and Mason\nexchanging quick furtive glances and wondering how long their story\nwould hold up, and Tom wondering how much Roger's changing the power\ncircuits on the radar had to do with the crash of the ship.\n\n\n\"That's right,\" snapped Connel to the two enlisted spacemen. \"I said I\nwanted the radar section of the communications deck closed and sealed\noff until further investigations. You can hook up and use one of the\nmonitors in the traffic control meantime.\"\n\nThe two red-clad spacemen turned and walked away. Stefens stood to one\nside.\n\n\"Don't you think that's carrying things a little too far, sir?\" he asked\nConnel.\n\n\"I'm doing this as much to protect Cadet Manning as I am to prosecute\nhim! I want to be sure there was no connection between the crash of the\n_Annie Jones_ and his tampering with the radar circuits!\" Connel\nreplied.\n\n\"I guess you're right, sir,\" replied Stefens. \"Those two survivors,\nLoring and Mason, are having coffee in the mess if you want to talk to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Did they change their story?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"None at all. They were hooking a ride back to Atom City, and they were\nasleep in the cargo hold. Jardine, one of the pilots, came in and told\nthem to pile out. They did.\"\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" mused Connel. \"I know those two, Loring and Mason. Had a\nlittle trouble with them recently on a trip to Tara. Suspended their\npapers. So if they were just hooking a ride, it might be they're telling\nthe truth!\"\n\n\"I have a report here on the damage to the station, sir, if you'd like\nto listen to it,\" said Stefens, handing his superior a spool of\naudiotape.\n\n\"Good! Did you make out the report yourself?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Yes, sir. With the assistance of Terry Scott and Cadet Corbett.\"\n\n\"Good lad, that Corbett,\" said Connel and paused. \"The whole unit is\ngood! If it weren't for that hare-brained Manning, I'd say they had as\nbright a future in the Solar Guard as any unit I've seen!\"\n\n\"I'll buy that, sir!\" said Stefens with a smile. \"That Corbett picked up\ntraffic-control operations like a duck takes to water. And it's been a\nlong time since Jenledge on the power deck raved about a cadet the way\nhe does about Astro.\"\n\nConnel smiled. He was reluctant to press for an investigation of the\nradar deck, knowing that if he did, it would mean a damaging black mark\nagainst Manning. But justice was justice, and Connel came closer to\nworshiping justice than anything else in space!\n\nConnel placed the spool of tape in the audiograph and settled in a chair\nto listen. He didn't like the entire affair. He didn't like to think of\nlosing a cadet of Manning's ability because of one stupid mistake. He\nhad recommended a thorough investigation. There was no other way. If\nManning was cleared of the responsibility for the crash, he was free,\nand it would not show up against his record. If he wasn't, however, then\nhe'd have to pay. Yes, thought Connel to himself, as Stefens' voice\nbegan to crackle harshly on the audiograph, if Manning was guilty, then\nManning would most certainly pay. Connel would see to that.\n\n\nDeep in the heart of the space station, Loring and Mason were huddled\nover steaming cups of coffee whispering to each other cautiously.\n\n\"Want more coffee, Mason?\" asked Loring.\n\n\"Who wants coffee when there's going to be a Solar Guard investigation?\"\nwhined Mason. \"Suppose they find out something?\"\n\n\"Relax, will ya?\" muttered Loring reassuringly. \"Connel doesn't suspect\na thing. Besides, he has that cadet under arrest!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" argued Mason, \"but you don't know those guys at Space Academy.\nAll this honor stuff! It's not like a regular investigation. They don't\nstop digging until they dig up _real facts_! They'll find out we stowed\naway and ...\"\n\nLoring calmly added cream and sugar to his coffee. \"They can't prove a\nthing. Jardine and Bangs are dead, and the ship's nothing but a pile of\njunk.\"\n\n\"They'll find out, I tell you, and now we've got murder on our hands!\"\n\nA door behind Mason suddenly opened and Stefens appeared.\n\n\"Shut up, you fool!\" Loring hissed. He turned blandly to face Stefens.\n\"Well, Captain, glad you came. I wanted to talk to you about getting us\ntransportation back to Venusport.\"\n\n\"You'll have to wait for the jet liner from Earth,\" said Stefens. \"See\nme in about two hours. Right now, I've got to make arrangements for the\ninvestigation of the crash.\"\n\n\"Sure, sir,\" said Loring. \"Ah--say, Captain, what do you expect the\ninvestigation to turn up?\"\n\n\"The true facts,\" replied Stefens. \"Whether the crash was due to the\nnegligence of Cadet Manning or something that happened on the ship.\"\n\n\"Then you really think the cadet may be responsible?\" asked Loring\nsoftly.\n\n\"He admits to negligence, and the _Annie Jones_ is a lot of evidence,\"\nsaid Stefens with a shrug, and walked out.\n\n\"There's our answer!\" said Loring triumphantly. \"Come on!\"\n\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Mason.\n\n\"We're going to have a little talk with our fall guy!\"\n\n\n\"Ahhh, sit down, Roger,\" said Astro. \"Everything will be O.K.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Tom. \"You're just wearing out the deck and your nerves\nwalking back and forth like that. Everything will be O.K.\" Tom tried\nhard to keep any apprehension out of his voice.\n\n\"Nothing will make those two guys on the spaceship O.K.,\" said Roger. He\nkicked viciously at a stool and sat down on the side of his bunk.\n\nSince the crash, Roger had been confined to his quarters, with Tom and\nAstro bringing him his meals. Tom had watched his unit-mate grow more\nand more bitter over the turn of events and was afraid Roger would do\nsomething rash.\n\nThe central communicator over the door suddenly buzzed, and the three\ncadets waited for the announcement.\n\n\"... Cadets Corbett and Astro report to rocket cruiser _Polaris_ for\nindoctrination on hyperdrive--on the double--by order of Major Connel.\"\n\nTom and Astro got up. Astro found it hard to hide his eagerness to begin\nindoctrination on hyperdrive, and it was only his deep concern for Roger\nthat kept him from letting out one of his bull-throated bellows.\n\n\"Take it easy, Roger,\" said Tom. \"The investigation will be over and\nwe'll be on our way to Tara before you know it.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you space Romeo,\" growled Astro, \"crawl in the sack and rest your\nbones. You're lucky you can miss this.\"\n\nRoger managed a weak smile. \"I'll be O.K. Go ahead and learn about that\nhyperdrive before you explode.\"\n\nThere was an awkward moment while the three cadets stared at one\nanother. The deep friendship between them didn't need to be expressed in\nwords. Abruptly, Tom and Astro turned and left the room.\n\nRoger stared at the closed door for a moment and then flopped on his\nbunk. He closed his eyes and tried to go to sleep. Whatever happened, he\nthought, it wouldn't do any good to knock himself out.\n\nAs he lay there thinking back to the first months at Space Academy when\nhe had met Tom and Astro, he heard a knock on the door and he turned to\nsee the steel hatch slide back stealthily. He jumped up.\n\nLoring stuck his head inside the door. \"You alone, Manning?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yeah. Who're you?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"My name's Loring, and this is my space buddy, Al Mason. We were on the\n_Annie Jones_.\"\n\nRoger's eyes lighted up. \"Then you know I'm not responsible for the\ncrash!\" said Roger.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that, kid,\" said Loring grimly. \"I wouldn't say that at\nall.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Roger.\n\n\"A shame\"--Loring shook his head--\"young fella like you winding up on\nthe prison asteroid.\"\n\n\"Prison asteroid?\" asked Roger stupidly.\n\n\"Yeah,\" grunted Loring. \"Have you ever seen one of them joints, Manning?\nThey work from noon to midnight. Then they give you synthetic food to\neat, because it costs too much to haul up solid grub. Once you've been\non the prison rock, you can't ever blast off again. You're washed up as\na spaceman. Think you'll like that?\"\n\n\"Why--why--what's that got to do with me?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Just this, kid. After the investigation they'll find out your\nradarscope wasn't working right. Then they'll come to me and ask me what\nhappened aboard the _Annie Jones_.\"\n\n\"Well,\" demanded Roger, \"what did happen?\"\n\nLoring glanced at Mason. \"Just this, kid. Jardine and Bangs were on the\nteleceiver and the radar for fifteen minutes trying to pick up your\nbeam. But there wasn't any, because you had it fouled up!\"\n\nRoger sat down on the side of the bunk and stared at the two men. If\nwhat they said was true, Roger knew there could only be one outcome to\nthe investigation.\n\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" asked Roger quietly.\n\n\"Very simple. I don't like to see _anyone_ go to the prison rock!\"\n\n\"Are you\"--Roger hesitated--\"are you suggesting that I escape?\"\n\nLoring and Mason got up and walked to the door. Loring turned back to\nface Roger. \"I'm not suggesting anything, Manning,\" he said. \"You're a\nbig boy and should know what's good for you. But\"--he paused and\nmeasured his words carefully--\"if I were you, I wouldn't wait around for\nConnel or anyone else to blast my life to pieces by sending me to a\nprison for one little mistake!\"\n\nThe hatch slid closed behind the two spacemen.\n\nRoger stood up and began packing a small spaceman's bag. There was a jet\nliner coming in from Atom City that would make a stop at Venusport. He\nglanced at his watch. Thirty minutes. He didn't have much time.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is a general alert!\" Tom Corbett's voice was\nhollow as he spoke over a solar-wide audiocast. \"Wanted! Space Cadet\nRoger Manning. Five feet, eleven inches tall, one hundred sixty-five\npounds. Blue eyes. Blond hair. Last seen wearing dress blues. Cadet\nManning broke confinement to quarters on Venus space station and is\nbelieved to be heading back to Earth. He is wanted in connection with\nthe crash of the space freighter _Annie Jones_ and the death of two\nspacemen. All information regarding the whereabouts of Manning should be\nforwarded to Captain Isaiah M. Patrick, Senior Security Officer, Solar\nGuard, Space Academy, Earth. This alert is to be transmitted to all\nlocal authorities.\"\n\nTom snapped the switch off and silently watched the glowing audio tubes\ndarken. He turned to one side and saw Astro. The big Venusian was seated\non a desk, slumped over, his head held in his massive hands.\n\n\"You know,\" said Astro slowly, \"I could take that guy Manning and break\nhim in two for running out!\"\n\nTom didn't answer. When they had discovered that Roger was missing it\nhad been a terrific blow. Unaware that Roger, in his confused state of\nmind, had been an easy victim to Loring and Mason's trickery and had\ninnocently walked into their trap, the two cadets felt that his escape\nwas a breach of trust. Roger had given his spaceman's word that he would\nconfine himself to his quarters. Roger had broken that trust, and now\nthe fact was being flashed around the entire solar system; Roger Manning\nwas an escaped criminal!\n\n\"There's nothing we can do now,\" said Tom. \"The whole universe knows it.\nHe's finished! Washed up! The only thing that could save him now would\nbe absolute clearance by the investigation. But since he's run out, I\nguess it must be the other way around. He was afraid he was going to get\ncaught.\" Tom's voice was cold and bitter. \"And we can't blame anyone\nbut--\"\n\n\"_But Manning!_\" barked a voice behind them. Astro jumped up and snapped\nto attention. Tom turned to see Major Connel stride into the room. It\nwas at Connel's insistence that Tom had been ordered to broadcast the\nalert for Roger.\n\n\"That's the last time I ever want to hear any sympathy for a man who\nbroke his word!\" snarled Connel.\n\n\"I have something I'd like to say to the major,\" said Astro in a\ndeliberate voice, \"as man to man!\"\n\nEven at attention, Tom jerked his head involuntarily to look at Astro.\nConnel's eyes narrowed. \"Here it comes,\" he thought. \"Well, I've handled\nrebellion of this sort before.\" He stepped close to Astro. So close in\nfact that the black and gold of his uniform brushed the massive chest of\nthe cadet from Venus.\n\n\"You have permission to speak, man to man!\" snapped Connel.\n\nAstro paused for a moment. Then he relaxed and brought his eyes down to\nthe level of the major.\n\n\"I am a human being, sir,\" said Astro in the deepest voice Tom had ever\nheard. It was strong and full of emotion, yet controlled. \"And as long\nas I am a human being, I shall consider Roger Manning one of the finest\nmen I'll ever know.\"\n\n\"Are you finished?\" snapped Connel.\n\n\"No, sir, I'm not,\" said Astro. \"I speak in defense of the man, the\n_spaceman_, not the uniform, or the trust he betrayed. And I\nrespectfully request of the major that if his feelings for Cadet Manning\nare so violent that he finds it difficult to control them, that he make\na special effort to control them\"--Astro paused and stuck out his\nchin--\"in my presence!\"\n\nConnel stepped back. \"And if I don't?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Then I shall ask for a transfer from your command, sir, and if that is\nnot granted, then I shall resign from the Academy.\"\n\n\"And?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"And, sir--\" Astro stumbled.\n\n\"_And what_, Cadet Astro?\" roared Connel.\n\n\"I have nothing more to say, sir,\" said Astro.\n\nTom, who had at first had to control an impulse to laugh at the strange\nseriousness of Astro's manner and tone, now found it equally difficult\nto hold back the tears that were welling up in his eyes.\n\nConnel was not going to let the incident stand there. He had secretly\nhoped that such a situation would present itself, because he wanted to\nsee what material the _Polaris_ unit was made of. And he was secretly\nsatisfied. Any cadet who would offer to resign from the Academy in\ndefense of his unit-mate was a true spaceman. Connel wasn't going to\nallow Astro or Tom to resign over some foolish trick of Roger's, but, at\nthe same time, he couldn't allow them to take too many liberties with\ndiscipline. Connel turned to Tom.\n\n\"I suppose you feel the same way, Corbett?\" he asked.\n\n\"I do, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Of course you know I could make your lives miserable now,\" he\nthreatened.\n\n\"We are aware of that, sir,\" said Tom quietly.\n\n\"Very well, Cadets Corbett and Astro. I shall comply with your request.\nNot because of your request but out of respect for your feelings as\nspacemen. I wouldn't have thought much of you if you hadn't come out in\ndefense of Manning. And just for your own sake, Astro,\" said Connel,\nstepping back in front of the big cadet, \"never ask to talk to a Solar\nGuard officer man to man again. As long as you're still a member of the\nCadet Corps such disrespect will not be tolerated. Another man, who\nmight not have understood your feelings, could have used your desire for\nfair play as a means of trapping you into one of the worst offenses in\nthe Spaceman's Code--striking a Solar Guard officer!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" mumbled Astro. \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Report aboard the _Polaris_\"--Connel glanced at his watch--\"in fifteen\nminutes. I'm going to put you through your paces on hyperdrive and the\noperation of the transmitter.\"\n\n\"Then we're still going to make the trip to Tara, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We certainly are, Corbett,\" replied Connel. \"In two hours another cadet\nis arriving from the Academy to replace Roger. His name's Alfie Higgins.\nPerhaps you know him.\"\n\nTom smiled. \"Yes, sir, we know him,\" he replied. \"Cadet Higgins is a\nfriend of mine. He carries the nickname of 'The Brain.' Has the highest\nI.Q. in the Academy.\"\n\n\"Good. I'm glad you know him, because this is going to be a rough trip.\nWe got off to a bad start, but it's all over now. So forget it. And\nbefore I go, I want you to know this. In my personal opinion, Manning\nhad nothing to do with the crash. I think the whole trouble was caused\non the ship. I have nothing to back up my opinion, except my feelings.\nBut feelings can go a long way in making a man innocent until proved\nguilty. Unit dis-missed!\"\n\n\nAlfie Higgins listened attentively to the story of the crash and Roger's\ndisappearance as Tom, and then Astro, described the situation in detail.\n\n\"It is a pity, of course, but Manning was always the impulsive type. Not\nvery definite in his attitude and emotionally unstable,\" commented Alfie\nwhen the story was finished.\n\n\"Lay off that talk, you overstuffed brain!\" growled Astro. \"In this\noutfit, Roger is just away on vacation!\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, of course!\" said Alfie quickly. It wasn't wise to get off on\nthe wrong foot in a new unit, especially when one was trying to fill the\nshoes of a cadet, who, Alfie had to admit, had everything. Alfie\nHiggins' mother didn't raise any stupid children, he said to himself. He\nwas too happy being a member of the _Polaris_ unit, the hottest crew at\nthe Academy, to allow anything to interfere with his success.\n\n\"I've heard a great deal about hyperdrive,\" he said quickly, changing\nthe subject. \"I would appreciate it if you could describe the basis of\nthis new feature in space travel so that I may have at least a surface\nfamiliarity with its operation and application.\"\n\nAstro gulped and looked at Tom. \"Might as well get used to that kind of\nchatter, Astro,\" said Tom, smiling. \"Alfie can't talk any other way.\"\n\n\"Is there something wrong with the way I speak?\" asked Alfie, wrinkling\nup his nose a little to see through the thick lenses of his glasses.\n\n\"You wanta know about hyperdrive?\" growled Astro.\n\n\"To be sure, if you'd be so kind,\" said Alfie.\n\n\"Well, if you'll close your trap long enough, I'll tell you about it!\"\n\nAlfie sat back and waited, hands clasped around one knee.\n\n\"In the first place,\" began Astro, \"hyperdrive was developed by Joan\nDale back at the Academy. And it's so blasted simple, I get mad at\nmyself for not thinking of it first!\"\n\n\"Uhhh,\" snorted Alfie. \"I respect your great talent on the power deck,\nAstro, but I would hardly compare myself with Dale!\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" barked Astro. \"You'll see how simple it is! Hyperdrive is\nbased on the idea that the thrust of the rockets acts in the exact same\nway on _all_ the atoms inside the spaceship. So you can have as much\nthrust as you want and no one will feel a thing. Even if the ship were\nto accelerate a million times faster than the gravity of the Earth you\nwouldn't feel a thing, because all the atoms inside would be pushed\nalong at the same time!\" Astro sat back triumphantly.\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" commented Alfie. \"That sounds all right as a principle, but\nwill it work out in space?\"\n\n\"Listen, you--you--\" snorted Astro.\n\n\"Sure it will, Alfie,\" said Tom. \"It's been tested before.\"\n\n\"Still room for improvement, though,\" commented Alfie.\n\n\"I'll improve your head,\" barked Astro, \"if you don't close that big\nmouth! How do you like that, Tom? We get rid of one space-gassing Romeo\nand now we get one even worse!\"\n\nAstro's reference to Roger made Tom draw a quick breath. In the short\nwhile since Alfie's arrival and the week since Roger's disappearance\nthere hadn't been time to forget their old unit-mate and get accustomed\nto a new personality. Astro sensed Tom's feelings and irritably banged\none hamlike fist into the other. Alfie was O.K., thought the big\nVenusian, but by the craters of Luna, he wasn't Roger.\n\n\"Attention--attention!\" The intercom crackled into life. \"_Polaris_\nunit--by order of Major Connel--stand by to blast off immediately. This\nis first warning! Pack your gear and stand by to blast off immediately.\"\n\nTom, Astro, and Alfie got up, and with the image of Roger fresh in their\nminds, made their way to the landing-port deck where the great gleaming\nspaceship was slung on magnetic cradles. They were met at the hatch by\nMajor Connel.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"we leave all thoughts of Manning right here on\nthe station. I know it's tough, but we've got a still tougher job to do.\nThis is to be a scientific expedition and we'll need every ounce of\nenergy and intelligence we have--_collectively_--to make a success of\nthis mission. Cadet Corbett!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Stand by to blast off in five minutes!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\"Can I speak with you a minute, spaceman?\"\n\nRoger turned from the automatic food dispenser and stared at a wizened\nlittle man standing beside him, grinning up at him toothlessly.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Just talk. Let's sit down at this table, eh?\" said the little man,\ntaking the cadet by the arm. \"Gotta little deal I think you might be\ninterested in.\"\n\nRoger cast a quick appraising glance over the shabbily dressed man and\nwalked to the table. Unless someone knew Roger personally, it would have\nbeen hard to recognize him. No longer wearing the vivid blue of the\nsenior Space Cadet, he was now dressed in black trousers fitting snugly\naround the legs, a midnight blue pull-over jersey, and the black-billed\nhat of the merchant spaceman. His once close-cropped blond hair was\nbeginning to grow shaggy around the edges, and with the hat pulled low\nover his forehead, he might have been another person entirely.\n\nLeaving the space station on the jet liner had been easy for Roger,\nsince no one suspected he would violate his trust. But once his absence\nwas discovered and the warrant issued for his arrest, it had been\nnecessary for him to assume some sort of disguise to elude the Solar\nGuard MP's. Roger had wound up on Spaceman's Row in Venusport as a\nmatter of course. Luckily, when he left the station, he had the\nforesight to take all of his money with him, so he was not yet in need.\n\nOn Spaceman's Row, Roger found the new freedom from discipline enjoyable\nat first, but now the novelty had worn off. Having visited all of the\ninteresting places on the Row, existence there had become boring. His\none attempt to leave Spaceman's Row had nearly met with disaster.\nRunning into a squad of Solar Guard MP's, he had made a hurried escape\ninto a near-by jet taxi. Back on the Row, Roger had lounged around the\ncaf\u00e9s, feeling the loneliness that haunts men wanted by the law. And\nonly because he was so lonely he had agreed to talk to the little man\nwho sat and stared at him from across the table.\n\n\"You a rocket pusher, astrogator, or skipper?\" asked the little man.\n\n\"Who wants to know?\" asked Roger cautiously.\n\n\"Look, sonny boy,\" was the quick retort. \"I'm Mr. Shinny! I'm the fixer\nof Spaceman's Row. You want something, come to me and I'll get it for\nyou. I don't care why you're here. That ain't none of my business. But\nthe fact remains that you're here, and you don't come down here unless\nyou're in trouble space deep!\"\n\nRoger looked at the little man more closely. \"Suppose I am in something\ndeep? What could you do for me?\" he asked.\n\n\"What would you want done?\" asked Shinny slyly.\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger casually, \"I could use a set of papers.\"\n\n\"What happened to your own?\"\n\n\"Solar Guard picked them up,\" answered Roger simply.\n\n\"For what?\" asked Shinny.\n\n\"Taking ice cream away from the skipper's pet monkey!\" snapped Roger.\n\nShinny threw back his head and laughed. \"That's good--very good!\" He\nwiped his mouth after spitting at a near-by cuspidor. He reached over\nand patted Roger on the arm. \"You'll do, sonny! You'll do right well on\nthe Row. Join me in a little acceleration sport?\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Rocket juice!\" said Shinny. \"Ain't you never heard of rocket juice?\"\n\n\"I've heard about it,\" said Roger with a smile, \"and I'm still here to\ntalk about it because I never drank any of it.\" Roger liked the little\nman for some reason--he couldn't tell why. He had met several people on\nthe Row since his arrival, but they had all wanted to know how many\ncredits he had and where he was staying.\n\n\"I took a jolt of that stuff once in Luna City,\" said Roger. \"I was\nready to blast off without a rocket ship!\"\n\nShinny laughed again. \"Good lad! Well, you won't mind if I have just a\nlittle one?\" He paused and wiped his lips. \"On you, of course!\"\n\n\"One\"--Roger held up his finger--\"on me, of course!\"\n\n\"Hey, there!\" yelled Shinny. \"You, with the asteroid head! Gimme a short\nbucket of that juice and bring a bottle of Martian fizz along with it!\"\nThe bartender nodded, and Shinny turned back to Roger. \"Martian fizz is\nnothing more than a little water with sugar in it,\" he explained.\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" replied Roger. \"What about those papers?\"\n\n\"I'll talk to you, spaceman to spaceman,\" said Shinny, \"when you're\nready to talk to me, spaceman to spaceman!\"\n\nThey were silent while the bartender slopped a glass full of bluish\nliquid in front of Shinny and the bottle of Martian fizz and a glass in\nfront of Roger. Roger paid for the drinks and poured a glass of the mild\nsweet water. Sipping it silently, he suddenly put the glass down again\nand looked Shinny in the eye.\n\n\"You know who I am,\" he stated quietly.\n\n\"Yep!\" replied Shinny. \"You're Roger Manning, Space Cadet! Breach of\nhonor and violation of the Spaceman's Oath. Escaped from the Venus space\nstation on a jet liner. But one of the best men on a radar scanner and\nastrogation prism in the whole alliance!\" Shinny related the information\nrapidly.\n\n\"He had known all the time,\" thought Roger. \"He was testing me.\" Roger\nwondered why.\n\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" questioned Roger, thinking about\nthe one-thousand-credit reward, standard price offered by the Solar\nGuard for all wanted men.\n\n\"If I had wanted to, I could have bought the finest jet liner in space\nwith money made on Solar Guard rewards,\" snapped Shinny. \"We got our own\nspaceman's code here on the Row. It goes something like this. What a man\nwants to bring with him down here, he brings. What he don't bring, don't\nexist!\"\n\nRoger smiled and stuck out his hand. \"All right, Mr. Shinny! I want a\nset of papers--space papers! Made out in any name, so that I can get out\ninto space again. I don't care where I go or on what, or how long I'm\ngone. I just gotta blast off!\"\n\n\"You want papers for the astrogation deck, or control, or as a power\npusher?\" asked Shinny.\n\nRoger thought a moment. \"Better make them for the control deck,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Credits,\" said Shinny. \"You have any credits?\"\n\n\"How much?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"One hundred now,\" said Shinny, and then added, \"and one hundred when I\ndeliver.\"\n\n\"Guaranteed papers?\"\n\n\"Positively!\" snorted Shinny. \"I don't sell things that ain't good! I'm\nan honest man!\"\n\nRoger reached inside his jersey and pulled out a small roll of crumpled\ncredit notes. He counted off one hundred and handed them over to Shinny.\n\n\"When do I get the papers?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Tomorrow, same place, same time,\" answered Shinny.\n\n\"What's the name of this place?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Caf\u00e9 Cosmos.\"\n\nRoger picked up his glass of sweet water, raising it in a toast to the\nlittle man in front of him. \"Until tomorrow, Mr. Shinny, when you come\nhere with the papers, or I come looking for you with bare knuckles!\"\n\n\"You don't scare me!\" snapped Shinny. \"I'll be here!\"\n\nRoger tilted his chair back and smiled his casual smile. \"I know you'll\nbe back, Mr. Shinny. You see, I really mean what I say. And more\nimportant, _you_ know I mean what I say!\"\n\nShinny got up. \"Tomorrow, same time, same place,\" he said, hurrying out\nthe door.\n\nRoger finished the bottle of Martian fizz, suddenly very depressed. He\ndidn't really want the false papers. He just wanted to get away from the\ndeadly humdrum existence on Spaceman's Row. He walked wearily back to\nhis scrubby little bedroom to wait for night to come. He hated to go\nback to the room, because he knew he would think about Tom and Astro and\nthe Space Academy. Now he couldn't allow himself to think about it any\nmore. It was past. Finished.\n\n\n\"You got _who_?\" asked Loring.\n\n\"I said I got the best astrogator in the deep for ya!\" snapped Shinny.\n\nLoring looked at Mason and then suddenly burst out laughing, dropping\nhis head on the table.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" demanded Shinny. \"You got space fever or\nsomething?\"\n\nMason, sitting quietly in the dirty hotel room, was grinning from ear to\near.\n\n\"So you got Manning for us, eh?\" repeated Loring at last. \"I wanta tell\nyou something, Shinny. I was the one that got that kid to break outta\nthat space station!\"\n\n\"You what?\" asked Shinny. The little spaceman had come to like the\nstraightforwardness of Roger.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Loring. \"When Mason and me loused up taking over\nthe _Annie Jones_, that kid, Manning, was on the radar watch at the\nstation. At the same time we were gonna crash into the station he\ncrossed a coupla wires and was talking to his girl back on Earth! They\nthink _he_ fouled up the radar and caused the crash!\"\n\n\"Then he's your fall guy,\" commented Shinny thoughtfully.\n\n\"Right,\" said Loring. \"And now you come along and tell us that we can\nget him to astrogate us out to Tara! I tell ya, Mason, this is the\ngreatest gag I've heard in years!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Mason, his weak mouth still stretched in a stupid grin,\n\"but you have to be careful he never finds out it was us that got him\ninto all his trouble!\"\n\n\"Leave that to me,\" said Loring. \"He'll never know a thing. In fact,\nhe'll thank us for getting him off the station and then giving him a\nchance to get back in space.\" He turned to Shinny. \"You got the ship?\"\n\n\"I told you before,\" said Shinny, \"there ain't anything to be had.\"\n\n\"Well, we gotta have a ship,\" said Loring. \"A fortune waiting for us in\nthe deep and no space wagon to go get it!\"\n\n\"There _is_ a ship,\" said Shinny. \"Not too good, but a spaceship.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Loring.\n\n\"Near Venusport. Out in the jungles, to be exact. Needs a little fixing,\nbut it'll make a deep space hop well enough.\"\n\n\"Who does it belong to?\" demanded Loring.\n\n\"Me,\" said Shinny, a strange twinkle in his eyes.\n\n\"_You?_\" gasped Loring. \"By the craters of Luna, where did you get a\nspaceship?\"\n\n\"Fifteen years ago a freighter was forced down in the jungles right near\nVenusport,\" said Shinny. \"I was prospecting near by for pitchblende,\nback when everybody thought Venus was loaded with it. I saw the crew\nleave in jet boats. Soon as they was out of sight I went over to take a\nlook. I wanted to see if there was any grub I could swipe and save\nmyself a trip back to Venusport for more supplies. Anyway, I went aboard\nand found the grub all right, but I got nosy about why they had made an\nemergency touchdown. I looked around the power deck and found they had\nbusted their reaction timer. I got the idea then of fixing it up and\nbringing it back to Venusport to give them young jerks a surprise. I\nlifted her off the ground and then figured why should I give it back?\nJust move it someplace else and let the vines and creepers grow over it\nfor a few days.\"\n\n\"Didn't the crew come back looking for it?\" asked Loring.\n\n\"Did they?\" chortled Shinny. \"I'll say they did! Almost drove them poor\nfellers crazy. I guess they searched for that old wagon for three months\nbefore giving up.\"\n\n\"And--and you mean it's still there--and in good condition?\" asked\nLoring.\n\n\"Needs a little fuel,\" said Shinny, \"and probably a good overhaul, but I\ndon't think there's anything serious the matter with it.\"\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" exclaimed Loring, \"we'll blast off\nimmediately!\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" said Shinny. \"I didn't say I'd give it to you.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you want for it?\" demanded Loring.\n\n\"Now let me see,\" mused Shinny. \"I figure that if _you_ figure to get as\nmuch as twenty million credits out of the copper, a full quarter share\nought to be about right.\"\n\n\"Five million credits for a--a ship that's been rotting in the jungle\nfor fifteen years!\" exclaimed Loring.\n\n\"She's in good shape,\" defended Shinny. \"I go out there every six months\nor so and turn over the reactors just to keep 'em from getting rusty.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you try to do something with it before?\" asked Loring.\n\n\"Never had no occasion to,\" answered Shinny. \"Well, is it a deal, or\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Too much,\" snapped Loring.\n\n\"That's my price,\" said Shinny.\n\n\"I could take the ship and not give you anything,\" sneered Loring.\n\n\"If the Solar Guard looked for three months in that jungle, with a\nhundred men and instruments, do you think you'll find it?\"\n\n\"I'll give you a fifth share,\" said Loring.\n\n\"Nope,\" said Shinny, \"I've named my price. You either take it or leave\nit!\" He glared at Loring.\n\nMason finally spoke. \"Take it, Loring,\" he said, \"and let's get out of\nhere. I'm getting jittery over that investigation that's coming up on\nthe station.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Loring, \"it's a deal. One quarter share for the ship.\"\n\n\"Done!\" said Shinny--\"Now I guess we'd better go talk to that boy\nManning, eh?\"\n\n\"Don't you think it'll be a little dangerous taking him along?\" whined\nMason.\n\n\"Yeah, maybe you're right,\" said Loring.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"If it was me,\" said Shinny, \"I wouldn't give it a second thought.\nYou're going into _deep_ space. It ain't like a hop to Mars or Titan.\nThis is as deep as you can go. If I was you, I'd want the best there is\nin my crew. And from what I've heard about that young feller, he's the\nbest there is on the radar bridge. You know who his father was?\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Mason.\n\n\"Ken--\" Shinny suddenly closed his mouth tight. \"Just another spaceman,\"\nhe said, \"but a good one!\" He rose quickly. \"Well, I'm supposed to meet\nManning in an hour at the Cosmos.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe three men left the dingy hotel and walked out into the main street\nof Spaceman's Row. In a few moments they arrived at the Caf\u00e9 Cosmos.\nRoger was already there, seated at the same table and watching the\ndoor. When he saw Loring and Mason with Shinny, he eyed them warily.\n\n\"Hiya, kid!\" greeted Loring. \"Glad to see you took my advice and got\naway from 'Blast-off' Connel.\" Mason waved a salute, and the three men\nsat down.\n\nRoger ignored Loring and Mason, speaking directly to Shinny. \"Did you\ncomplete our deal?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"Nope,\" answered Shinny. \"I brought you another one instead.\"\n\nRoger held out his hand. \"My one hundred credits--_now!_\"\n\n\"Never mind the credits, kid,\" said Loring, \"we've got more important\nthings to talk about.\"\n\nRoger continued to look at Shinny, his palm outstretched on the top of\nthe table. \"One hundred credits,\" he repeated coldly.\n\nReluctantly, Shinny handed over the money. Slowly, carefully, Roger\ncounted the bills, and then, after putting them away, he turned to face\nLoring for the first time.\n\n\"You said you have something important to discuss with me?\" he drawled.\n\n\"I see you learned fast, kid!\" said Loring with a crooked smile. \"I\nwouldn't trust Shinny as far as I could throw a comet!\"\n\nMason laughed loudly. The other three merely glared at him, and he\nstopped abruptly.\n\n\"Here's the proposition, Manning,\" said Loring, leaning across the\ntable. \"I've gotta ship and I wanta make a hop into deep space. I want\nyou to do the astrogation!\"\n\n\"I'm interested,\" said Roger. \"Keep talking.\"\n\nBriefly Loring described the copper satellite, its potential value, and\nwhat they expected to get out of it. Roger listened without comment.\nWhen Loring had finished, Shinny told him about the ship and its\ncondition. When Shinny finished, Loring turned to Roger.\n\n\"Well, Manning,\" he asked, \"how do you like the setup?\"\n\n\"How much do I get out of it?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"One twentieth of the take,\" said Loring.\n\n\"There are four of us. One full quarter-share, nothing less,\" drawled\nRoger.\n\n\"One-fourth to Shinny and one-fourth to him,\" whined Mason. \"That only\nleaves us a fourth apiece!\"\n\n\"That's more than you've got now,\" snapped Loring. \"All right, Manning,\nyou're in!\"\n\nRoger smiled for the first time. \"When do we blast off?\"\n\n\"As soon as we get that space wagon in shape we hit the deep!\" said\nLoring.\n\n\"I think I need a drink on that,\" said Shinny. He yelled for the\nbartender, who brought rocket juice and Martian fizz.\n\nRoger picked up the glass of the sweet water and glanced around the\ntable.\n\n\"What's the name of that space wagon you've got buried in the jungles,\nMr. Shinny?\"\n\n\"Ain't got no name,\" said Shinny.\n\nRoger paused, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. \"Then\nI propose we name her after the hearts of each of us here at the table.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Loring.\n\n\"_Space Devil_,\" said Roger.\n\nShinny grinned, his frail body trembling slightly from his silent\nlaughter. He held up the glass of rocket juice.\n\n\"I propose a toast to the _Space Devil_!\"\n\n\"To the _Space Devil_,\" said the others together.\n\n\"And whatever trouble she brings,\" added Roger softly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"Cadet _Higgins_!\" Major Connel's voice roared over the ship's intercom\nas the giant rocket cruiser _Polaris_ blasted smoothly through space.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" squeaked Alfie in reply.\n\n\"Cadet Higgins,\" said Connel, \"I thought I had requested a sight on the\nsun star Regulus at fifteen hundred hours!\"\n\n\"You did, sir,\" replied Alfie.\n\n\"_Then why, by the craters of Luna, don't I have that position?_\"\n\n\"I was--busy, sir,\" came the meek reply.\n\n\"Cadet Higgins,\" sighed Connel patiently, \"would you be so kind as to\ncome down to the control deck?\"\n\nIn the short space of time since their departure from the space station\nMajor Connel had learned that to scold Cadet Higgins was not the way to\ngain his attention. In fact, Major Connel had not been able to find a\nway of getting the little cadet's attention in any manner, at any time,\non anything.\n\n\"I can't right now, sir,\" replied Alfie.\n\n\"What do you _mean_, you can't?\" exploded Connel.\n\n\"I mean, sir,\" explained Alfie, \"that I've just sighted Tara and I have\nto get a position check on her before we go any farther, to ensure that\nwe traverse the same trajectory on our return trip and thus avoid the\nproblem of finding a new and safe route back.\"\n\n\"Cadet Alfie Higgins\"--Connel's voice climbed to a frenzied shriek--\"if\nyou are not on this control deck in ten seconds, I'll personally see\nthat you are fed to a dinosaur when we touch down on Tara and you'll\nnever return. _Now get down here!_\"\n\nTom and Astro, who could hear the conversation over the intercom, were\nfinding it very difficult to keep from laughing out loud at the\ninnocence of Alfie and the outraged wrath of Major Connel.\n\nTom, particularly, had discovered that Alfie's innocent refusal to be\nbullied by Connel had made the time pass more quickly on the long haul\nthrough deep space. More than once he had seen Major Connel rage against\nthe underweight cadet and become even more frustrated at his childlike\nresistance. It had helped Tom forget the empty feeling he experienced\nevery time he called the radar deck and heard Alfie's mild voice instead\nof Roger's usual mocking answer. Astro, too, had managed to forget the\nloneliness he felt aboard the great cruiser by watching the antics of\nAlfie and Major Connel. More than once he had instigated situations\nwhere Alfie would get caught red-handed in a harmless error, and then he\nlay flat on the power deck, laughing until his sides ached, as he\nlistened to Alfie and Major Connel over the intercom.\n\nIt had helped. Both Tom and Astro admitted it had helped, but it still\ndidn't take away the dull ache each felt when an occasional remark,\nsituation, or thought would bring Roger to mind.\n\nTom flipped the teleceiver on and waited for the blank screen to show\nhim Tara. Connel stood to one side, also watching for the image of the\nplanet to take form on the gray-black screen. A hatch clanked behind\nthem, and Alfie stepped into the control deck to snap to his version of\nattention.\n\n\"Cadet Higgins reporting, sir,\" he said quietly.\n\nConnel stepped in front of him, placed his hands on his hips, and bent\nslightly, pushing his face almost into Alfie's.\n\n\"Cadet Higgins, I want you to know I have taken all the blasted\nspace-brained antics I'm going to take from you,\" said Connel quietly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Alfie blandly.\n\n\"And,\" said Connel, shaking a finger in Alfie's face, \"_and_ if there is\none more--just _one_ more brazen, flagrant disregard of my _specific_\norders, then, Cadet Higgins, I promise you the most miserable trip back\nto Earth you will ever know in your entire career! I promise you I'll\nmake you sweat! I'll--I'll--\" Connel stopped short and shuddered.\nAlfie's owl-eyed look of innocence seemed to unnerve him. He tried to\nresume his tirade, but the words failed him. He finally turned away,\ngrowling, \"Higgins, get up on that radar deck and do as you're told,\n_when_ you're told to do it and _not_ when you want to do it! Is that\nclear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Alfie meekly. He saluted and returned to the radar\ndeck.\n\n\"Corbett!\" snapped Connel. \"If I should appear to be losing control of\nmyself when addressing Cadet Higgins, you have my official permission to\nrestrain me. Use force if necessary!\"\n\nTom bit his lip to keep from laughing and managed to mumble \"Yes, sir.\"\nHe turned quickly to the control board and began focusing on the planet\nlying dead ahead of the decelerating spaceship. They had been slowing\ndown for several days, since their speed with the added hyperdrive had\nbeen increased greatly. The young cadet adjusted the last dial and the\nblue-green planet sprang into clear sharp focus on the screen.\n\n\"Why,\" gasped Tom. \"Sir, look! It's just like Earth!\"\n\n\"In more ways than one, Corbett,\" replied Connel. \"What's our range?\"\n\n\"I'd say we're close enough to reduce thrust to a quarter regular space\nspeed, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Connel. \"Now look to the right on the screen. See that\nsmall dark patch over there in the middle of the planet?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"That's where we want to touch down,\" said Connel. \"You stay here on the\ncontrol deck and maneuver the ship closer in while I go to the radar\ndeck and contact Space Academy on the transmitter. I've got to report\nthat we expect to land soon.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Tom. He turned and flipped the intercom switch.\n\"Control deck to power deck,\" he said. \"Check in, Astro.\"\n\n\"Power deck here,\" replied Astro. \"What's up, Tom?\"\n\n\"We just got our first good look at Tara. She's dead ahead. Major\nConnel's going to contact Space Academy, and I'm going to maneuver into\nour preliminary glide. Stand by for course changes.\"\n\n\"Make it an easy touchdown. I wanta get home, you know,\" replied Astro\ngood-naturedly.\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Tom. \"Better bring her down to one-quarter space speed.\"\n\n\"Hyper or regular?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Regular!\" yelled Tom. \"You give me a quarter on hyper and we'll go\nright through that planet!\"\n\n\"One-quarter regular space speed,\" replied Astro.\n\nTom adjusted his controls for the speed reduction, while keeping his\neyes on the teleceiver screen. He watched the planet grow larger before\nhis eyes, and the terrain become more distinct. He could see two large\noceans, the green-blue of the water reflecting the sunlight of Alpha\nCentauri brilliantly. Nearer and nearer the _Polaris_ plummeted, and Tom\ncould begin to distinguish the rough outline of mountain ranges along\nthe horizon line. He switched to a larger view of the planet on the\nmagnascope that revealed a splendor rivaling the beauty of his own\ncherished Earth.\n\n\"We'll be entering the atmosphere in a minute, Alfie,\" yelled Tom into\nthe intercom. \"Stand by to give range for touchdown.\"\n\n\"Radar deck, aye,\" reported Alfie. \"Range at present five hundred\nmiles.\"\n\n\"Power deck, check in!\" yelled Tom.\n\n\"Power deck, aye,\" returned Astro.\n\n\"All set below?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"All set,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Reduce thrust to minimum!\" shouted Tom.\n\nDeep inside the powerful ship, the roar of the mighty atomic rocket\nmotors began to fade to a deep growling purr.\n\n\"Control deck to radar deck. Major Connel, sir?\"\n\n\"What is it, Corbett?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"We're ready for a touchdown. Do you want to take over the bridge?\"\n\n\"Can't you do it, Corbett?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Then carry on,\" replied Connel. \"I'm having some trouble trying to get\nthrough to the Academy on the transmitter. Can't understand it.\" There\nwas a pause. \"I have them now, Corbett! You carry on!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Tom. He turned his attention to the control panel,\nchecking the many dials and gauges with one sweeping glance, and then\nconcentrated on bringing the ship to a safe landing on the foreign\nplanet. His fingers tingled as he reached for the switches that would\nbring the ship down on the first intergalactic world he had ever\nvisited. In a flash, the curly-haired cadet remembered childhood dreams\nof doing just what he was doing at this moment, preparing to touch down\non a new world, millions of miles away from his home near New Chicago.\n\n\"Range one hundred miles,\" reported Alfie over the intercom.\n\n\"Power deck, reduce thrust to absolute minimum!\" ordered Tom. \"I want as\nlittle sustaining power as you can give me without cutting out\naltogether, Astro.\"\n\n\"Can do!\" said Astro. The ship slowed even more, then suddenly picked up\nspeed again as the gravity of Tara began to tug at the space traveler.\n\n\"Stand by to fire braking rockets!\" yelled Tom. He was all nerves now,\nsensitive to the throbbing of the great ship's motors, eyes fastened to\nthe dials and meters on the control panel. There was no time to watch\nthe scanner view of the onrushing planet now. He had to touch down\nblindly, using only his instruments. \"Radar bridge, report!\" snapped\nTom.\n\n\"Range one thousand feet,\" reported Alfie, his calm voice in striking\ncontrast to the nervous excitement in Tom's. \"Seven hundred fifty--six\nhundred--five fifty--\"\n\n\"Fire braking rockets!\" rasped Tom into the intercom.\n\nThe great ship bucked under the sudden thrust of the huge braking\nrockets. The _Polaris_ held steady for a moment, then gradually, as the\npull of Tara began again, she settled back toward the dark-green\njungles beneath her.\n\n\"Two hundred and fifty feet,\" reported Alfie. \"One hundred and\nseventy-five--one fifty--\" he droned.\n\n\"Ease her up, Astro,\" shouted Tom. \"Easy! Ease her up, you Venusian\nclunk, we're dropping too fast!\"\n\nOnce again, from the heart of the _Polaris_, there came a roaring blast\nof the powerful motors. The ship steadied once more and then slipped\nback into her fall toward the new planet under more sure control.\n\n\"Fifty feet,\" reported Alfie. \"Forty--thirty--twenty--\"\n\nThere was a brief pause, as if everything had stopped and they were held\nstill by a giant hand, and then, suddenly, a rocking motion, a slight\nbump and rumble. Tom knew they were down.\n\n\"_Touchdown!_\" he yelled at the top of his voice. \"Touchdown! We made\nit--we made it!\"\n\nFrom the power deck, quiet except for the whining of the oxygen feed\npump, Astro's bellow could be heard vibrating through the passageways.\n\n\"_Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeooooooooooooowwwwwww!_\"\n\nTom began shutting off the many circuits and switches and made a quick\nlast-minute check of the now dead ship. Satisfied, he glanced at the\ngreat solar clock, noted the time in the log, and stepped to the ladder\nleading to the radar bridge.\n\n\"Cadet Corbett reporting, sir,\" said Tom, saluting smartly. \"I wish to\nreport, sir, that the _Polaris_ made touchdown on the planet Tara at\nexactly seventeen fifty-nine, solar time!\"\n\nConnel, his great bulk bent over the tiny transmitter, was twirling the\ndials, his head encased in a vacuum earphone helmet to ensure perfect\nsilence. He had acquired the knowledge of lip reading out of necessity\non the power decks of the old chemical burners thirty years before, and\nwhile he couldn't hear what Tom had said, he knew what the report was.\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" he shouted, not being able to judge the volume of\nhis voice. \"Good job! Can't seem to pick them up at the Academy again.\nHad them once, then lost them. Am placing you in command of an\nexpedition for a quick look outside. Arm yourselves with paralo-ray guns\nand rifles. Take a jet boat and under no circumstances are you to land.\nDismissed! Oh, yes, one more thing. Take Alfie Higgins along with you\nand keep _your eye on him_. Report back in one hour!\"\n\nTom felt a tingle of excitement run up his backbone as he heard the\ntough skipper give him permission to explore the planet.\n\nHe saluted and turned away, Alfie trailing him down the ladder.\n\n\"Hey, Astrooooo!\" yelled Tom. \"Get number-one jet boat out of the hatch.\nWe're going for a look-see at this place!\"\n\nTom went to the gun locker and took out three paralo-ray guns and\nrifles. He made sure each of them was fully loaded and then handed them\nto Alfie.\n\n\"Put these on the jet boat, Alfie. I'll be along in a minute.\"\n\nAlfie took the guns and walked toward the jet-boat catapult deck. Tom\nreturned to the radar bridge and stood before Connel.\n\n\"Would you see if there is any news of Roger, sir, when you make contact\nwith the Academy?\"\n\nConnel read the cadet's lips and nodded his head. Tom turned and went\ndirectly to the jet-boat deck. Astro and Alfie waited for him inside.\n\n\"Brought along three space suits, Tom,\" said Astro. \"You can never tell\nwhat we might run into.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said Tom.\n\nThe three cadets climbed into the jet boat, Tom taking the pilot's seat.\nHe pushed a release button, and a portion of the _Polaris'_ steel hull\nslid back. Tom pressed another button, gripped the wheel of the small\nspace craft, and stepped on the acceleration pedal. The little red ship\nshot out of the open hatch and zoomed over the giant trees.\n\nTraveling at a slow speed, Tom made a wide arc over the forest, checking\nhis position against that of the _Polaris_ before losing sight of it. He\npulled the tiny ship up to one thousand feet, leveled off, set the\nautomatic pilot, and took his first close look at Tara, four and a half\nlight years from Earth.\n\nFrom above, Tara seemed to be a quagmire of reptiles, dinosaurs, and\ndense vegetation reaching as high as the gleaming towers of Venusport\nand Atom City. Huge trees that spread their branches over an area of a\nthousand feet soared skyward, limbs and trunks wrapped in jungle\ncreepers. Now and then Alfie would grasp Tom or Astro by the arm and\npoint a wavering finger at a moving animal below, then gasp and fall\nback white-faced into his seat. While Tom was inclined to share Alfie's\nreactions, Astro took it in stride, having been exposed to the dangers\nof wild jungles on his own Venus.\n\nThe tiny jet boat raced out across the blue-green sea that swept up in\ngiant swells along the snow-white sandy beaches. It was a temptation to\nset the small craft down and enjoy the pleasure of a swim after the many\ndays of cramped, tortured living on the _Polaris_. But Tom remembered\nConnel's orders and also had a lot of respect for some of the things he\nhad seen swimming in the water.\n\n\"Better get back,\" said Tom. He flipped the audiophone switch in the jet\nboat and spoke into a small mike.\n\n\"Jet boat one to _Polaris_. Jet boat one to _Polaris_. Cadet Corbett to\nMajor Connel.\"\n\nThere was a crackle of static and then Connel's voice, vibrant and\nclear, filled the small cabin.\n\n\"Corbett!\" he roared. \"By the craters of Luna, I couldn't contact you.\nReturn to the _Polaris_ on the double!\"\n\n\"Is there something wrong, sir?\" asked Tom, apprehensive after seeing\nthe wildness of the jungle below him.\n\n\"Wrong?\" blared Connel. \"News from Earth--from the Academy! Roger's been\ncleared of all charges.\"\n\n\"Cleared?\" stammered Tom.\n\n\"Absolutely! When I sealed the radar bridge after the crash, a security\nofficer examined the settings on the scanners and transmitting\nequipment. They showed that Roger _had_ been on duty at the time--that\nhe had been tracking the ship as he claimed.\"\n\n\"Then what was the reason for the crash?\"\n\n\"Security isn't sure yet. An acceleration control lever is missing from\nthe wreckage. And it wasn't broken off as a result of the crash. Now\nLoring and Mason are wanted for further questioning.\"\n\nTom looked at his unit-mate, Astro. The big Venusian had his head turned\nto one side; he seemed to be staring out over the vast writhing jungle.\n\n\"Astro, did you hear?\" asked Tom softly.\n\n\"Yeah,\" mumbled Astro in a small, choked voice. \"Just don't ask me to\nturn around.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"How much longer before we reach the atmosphere of Tara, Manning?\" asked\nLoring.\n\nRoger bent over the chart table and quickly measured the distance\nbetween his present position and that of Tara.\n\n\"About two hours,\" he said, straightening up.\n\n\"Good!\" said Loring. \"Let me know soon as we get close.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" replied the cadet.\n\n\"Hey, radar deck!\" Mason's voice came over the intercom from the power\ndeck of the _Space Devil_. \"Don't forget to let me know when I have to\ncut down on thrust!\"\n\n\"Take it easy, spaceboy,\" snapped Roger. \"You'll know in plenty of\ntime!\" He turned back to the radar scanner and continued the\nnever-ending sweep of space ahead.\n\nAfter a week of checking and reconditioning the _Space Devil_ in the\nwild Venusian jungles, Roger had become more and more disgusted with\nhimself. Being a wanted spaceman had had its disadvantages on Spaceman's\nRow, but working in the steaming jungles, fighting deadly reptiles and\ninsects, with Loring and Mason on his neck every minute had soured his\nappetite for adventure. Several times, when Roger had suggested a\ncertain part be replaced, Loring and he had argued violently, and Roger\nhad threatened to quit. Now, after the long tedious trip through space,\nRoger's relationship with the others was more strained than ever. The\nsure dependability of Tom on the control deck and Astro on the power\ndeck made the work of Loring and Mason sloppy by comparison. Once, when\nRoger had been on radar watch, while the ship roared through the\nasteroid belt, collision with a small asteroid had threatened. Roger\nordered a course change, but Mason, who had taken over the power deck,\nhad been asleep. Luckily, Shinny had been near by, had made the course\nchange, and saved the ship. Seething with anger, Roger had gone to the\npower deck and given the shiftless spaceman a terrific beating.\n\nOver and over, conflicts had arisen among them as they blasted through\ndeep space, and always, it seemed to Roger, he was in the middle of it.\nThe only satisfaction he could find in the hazardous venture was the\nprospect of the five million credits. And even this had lost its\nexcitement in the last few days, as his nerves stretched to the breaking\npoint. Only the sly humor of Shinny had saved Roger from the monotony of\nthe long haul through space.\n\nRoger absently flipped the scanner to its farthest range. He had been\nobserving the planet Tara for several hours and knew its shape fairly\nwell. But he suddenly jerked to attention. His hands trembled slightly\nas he peered intently at the scope. Finally he slumped back. There was\nno doubt about it. On the scanner was a jet boat in flight.\n\n\"Hey, Loring! Shinny! Mason! Get up here on the double!\" he yelled into\nthe intercom.\n\n\"What's up?\" demanded Loring.\n\n\"Get up here!\" shouted Roger. \"We're in for trouble--plenty of trouble!\"\n\nPresently the three spacemen were grouped around the scanner, staring at\nthe unmistakable outline of a jet boat.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" declared Loring, \"it must be Connel and his\ncrew!\"\n\n\"What're we going to do?\" whined Mason.\n\nLoring's face darkened. \"Only one thing we can do now,\" he growled.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"I mean that we're going to blast them!\" Loring snarled. \"Connel and\nwhoever else is with him!\"\n\n\"But--but--\" stammered Roger, \"the _Polaris_ crew is down there!\"\n\n\"Listen, Manning!\" Loring turned to the cadet. \"Have you forgotten that\nyou're wanted by the Solar Guard? You give that bunch down there a\nchance and they'll make you a space crawler on prison rock!\"\n\n\"Why--I--\" stammered Roger. He knew what Loring had said was the truth.\nIf it was Connel, there would be no question what would happen to him.\nHe faced Loring. \"What will you do to them?\"\n\n\"One well-placed reactant bomb, and they'll never know a thing!\" sneered\nLoring.\n\n\"But you don't have any bombs aboard,\" said Roger.\n\n\"A little of the fuel and I can build one easily enough,\" replied\nLoring. He turned to Mason. \"Go below and suit up to go into the\nreaction chamber,\" he ordered. \"Get an extra lead suit out. I'll go in\nand help you. And find something we can use for a trigger and a fuse.\"\nHe smiled at Roger. \"It might be a little crude, but it'll be fancy\nenough for what we want. I'm going to blast the _Polaris_ from here back\nto your sweet little Space Academy!\"\n\nMason and Loring left the radar bridge while Shinny and Roger watched\nthe white blip of the jet boat.\n\n\"That could be Tom and Astro in that jet boat,\" said Roger softly to\nhimself.\n\n\"I guess I'd better stand by the power deck while we maneuver,\" said\nShinny. \"We wanta stay hidden until Loring and Mason get that thing\nready.\"\n\nRoger nodded, and Shinny disappeared.\n\nManeuvering cautiously, Roger brought the _Space Devil_ around to the\nnight side of Tara opposite to the landing site of the _Polaris_.\n\nFour hours later Loring and Mason came out of the reactant chamber\ncarrying a small lead box. They placed it gently on the deck and began\ntaking off their lead suits. Roger and Shinny stared at the box.\n\n\"There she is,\" said Loring. \"Not much to look at, but there's enough\njuice in there to blast the _Polaris_ into space junk!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Loring!\" said Roger. \"There'll be no killing! No one\ngets hurt!\"\n\n\"Got a squeamish stomach, eh, kid?\" Loring laughed. He slapped Mason on\nthe back. \"Our little Space Cadet is suddenly worrying about his\nfriends. The same friends that wanted to send him away to the prison\nasteroid.\"\n\n\"Blast the ship if you want,\" said Roger coldly, \"but don't hurt the\ncrew!\"\n\n\"Listen, Manning!\" snarled Loring. \"If the crew gets hurt it ain't my\nfault. If they're in the ship, that's tough. If not, then that's O.K.\nwith me. I ain't sending them any letter telling them I'm going to\nblast their ship and then have them come up after me with a space\ntorpedo!\"\n\nRoger didn't answer. He turned away and climbed back to the radar\nbridge. Loring followed him up the ladder.\n\n\"Don't get any ideas about warning your buddies, Manning, 'cause if you\ndo, I'll blast you before I blast them!\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" replied Roger. \"It's daytime on the other side of Tara\nnow, where the _Polaris_ is. The crew might be out on a scouting mission\nor making observations away from the ship. There's less chance of their\nbeing on the ship. If we're going to do it, let's get it over with!\"\n\n\"O.K. with me,\" said Loring. \"Take this wagon up toward Alpha Centauri a\nlittle way. Coming out of the sun, they won't see us. We'll use one of\nthe jet boats to deliver our little present. I'll set the fuse, put the\njet boat on automatic, and aim it right for the _Polaris_.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Manning reluctantly. He turned to the chart table,\nplotted a course, and issued orders to Shinny at the controls and to\nMason on the power deck. Soon the _Space Devil_ was blasting away from\nthe night side of the planet, heading toward the sun. When they reached\nan altitude of a thousand miles above the surface of the planet, Loring\nmaneuvered the jet boat into position outside the ship and placed the\ncrude reactant bomb inside. Ready, he gave Roger the signal to make the\nrun out of the sun toward the _Polaris_. Roger relayed the orders to\nShinny and Mason, and the _Space Devil_ rocketed back toward the planet\nagain.\n\nLoring, sitting inside the jet boat, waited until they had reached an\naltitude of five hundred miles.\n\n\"All right, Manning,\" said Loring, \"give me the course!\"\n\nRoger calculated the rotational speed of the planet, the _Space Devil's_\naltitude, and the speed of the jet boat. He drew a line between the\n_Space Devil_ and _Polaris_, checked it on the astro compass, and\nreached for the intercom mike. He ran a dry tongue over his lips and\ncalled out the course.\n\n\"Course is one forty-three--\" He caught himself and stared at the chart.\nSuppose Tom or Astro or anyone was near the ship? Even if he missed by\nseveral hundred yards, the bomb would certainly be fatal. If he only\nchanged the course one degree, at a range of five hundred miles, it\nwould miss the _Polaris_ by several miles. And Loring wouldn't be able\nto see anything because of the dust cloud.\n\n\"Course corrected,\" said Roger. \"New course is one forty-two!\"\n\n\"One forty-two!\" repeated Loring.\n\nRoger sat back and waited for the small space craft to blast off from\nthe ship. In his mind, he saw Loring setting the trigger on the bomb,\nadjusting the controls, setting the automatic pilot, and then pressing\nthe acceleration button. Roger gripped the sides of the chart table and\nstared at the radar scanner. A fast-moving blip was streaking across its\nsurface. Loring had started the jet boat.\n\nHis eyes showing his great fear, Roger watched the blip as it sped down\nlike a maddened hornet toward the _Polaris_ resting on its directional\nfins in the green jungle. He could hear the hatch slam closed below as\nLoring re-entered the ship, but he continued to watch the rapidly moving\nblip.\n\nSuddenly it disappeared, and Roger knew it had reached Tara. He slumped\nback in his chair. His eyes were glassy, his ears deaf to the roar of\ntriumph from below as Loring and Mason, watching the flight of the jet\nboat on the control deck teleceiver screen, saw it explode. Roger\ncouldn't move. He had fired a reactant bomb at Tom and Astro.\n\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" roared Connel, \"we've been attacked!\"\n\nThe four Earthmen, exploring a valley several miles north of the\n_Polaris_, had been thrown to the ground when the bomb landed. Connel's\nreaction was immediate and decisive.\n\n\"Get into the jet boat! All of you! We've got to get back to the\n_Polaris_! If our ship is smashed, we'll spend the rest of our lives\nfighting this jungle!\"\n\nIn a matter of seconds the four spacemen were rocketing over the jungle\ntoward the _Polaris_. Presently they came to an enormous dust cloud that\nhad mushroomed out over the trees. It was so thick Tom found it\ndifficult to pilot the small craft.\n\n\"Any danger of radioactivity in this dust, sir?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Always that possibility, Astro,\" answered Connel. \"We'll know soon\nenough!\" He flipped on a built-in Geiger counter on the dashboard of the\njet boat, and immediately the cabin was filled with a loud ticking that\nwarned of danger.\n\n\"The count is up to seven fifty, sir,\" said Astro. \"Not enough to bother\nyou unless you're in it a long time.\"\n\n\"There's the _Polaris_, sir,\" yelled Tom. \"She's still on her\ndirectional fins! They missed her! She's O.K.!\"\n\n\"By the blessed rings of Saturn, she is!\" exclaimed Connel. \"Go on, Tom,\ngive this baby the gun! If we have to die, let's die like spacemen, in\nspace, fighting with spaceman's weapons, not crawling around here in the\njungle like worms!\"\n\nThe three boys smiled at their skipper's rousing statement. \"This is the\ntime,\" thought Tom, \"when I'd rather have Major Connel in command than\nanyone else in the Solar Guard.\" If there was to be a fight, then they\ncertainly had found the man who knew how to do just that! Fight!\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTom swooped over the treetops recklessly, and fearing the blast had\ndamaged the jet-boat air lock, brought the small craft to rest in the\nblinding dust a few yards away from the _Polaris_.\n\nThree minutes later the four spacemen had separated and were standing by\ntheir respective posts. Hasty but thorough checks were made to determine\nthe damage, and finding none, they prepared to raise ship.\n\n\"All clear forward and up,\" Alfie reported in a high squeaking voice.\n\n\"Energize the cooling pumps,\" shouted Tom.\n\nAstro had already started the mighty pumps, their vibrations rocking the\nship, and Tom began counting the seconds.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship. Minus\nfive--four--three--two--one--_zeeroooooo!_\"\n\nPaying scant attention to the crush of sudden acceleration, Tom gave the\nship all the power she could take for the climb out of Tara's\natmosphere, and soon they were rocketing through the airless void of\nspace. Alfie and Connel hurriedly swept the area with the radar scanner\nfor the attacking intruder.\n\n\"There she is!\" roared Connel. \"There!\" He placed a finger on a white\nblip on the scanner. \"By the craters of Luna, that's an Earth ship!\" The\nfear of an outer-space invasion by hostile people from another world had\nbeen in the back of his mind, but he had been reluctant to voice his\nfears in front of the cadets. \"And she's an old one at that!\" he\nexclaimed. \"Not even armed. I know that class vessel. Corbett!\" he\nshouted.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Put the ship on automatic flight, attack-approach pattern number three.\nThen stand by to send a message to whoever's manning that ship!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" replied Tom. He hurriedly set the delicate device that\nwould fly the ship in a preplanned course of zigzag maneuvers and opened\nthe circuits of the teleceivers.\n\n\"All set for the message, sir,\" reported Tom.\n\n\"Tell them,\" said Connel heavily, his voice cold, \"whoever they are,\nthat I'll give them two minutes to surrender. If they don't, I'll blast\nthem into protons!\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Tom. He turned to the teleceiver and began\ntwirling the dials.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to spaceship X.\n_Polaris_ to spaceship X. You are ordered to surrender within two\nminutes or we will attack. By order of Major Connel, Senior Line\nOfficer, Solar Guard.\"\n\nHe switched the teleceiver for reception and waited. In a moment the\nscreen blurred and then an image appeared. Tom gasped. It was Roger!\n\n\"Tom, Tom,\" yelled Roger. \"Tom, this is me--Roger!\"\n\n\"Roger! What're you doing out here? How'd you get here?\"\n\n\"I can't explain now,\" said Roger. \"I--I--\"\n\nTom interrupted him. \"Roger, you've been cleared! The investigation of\nthe crash on the station proved that Loring and Mason are guilty.\nThey're wanted for the crash and the deaths of Jardine and Bangs!\"\n\n\"What! You mean--\" stammered Roger.\n\n\"Yes. Loring and Mason did the whole thing!\" supplied Tom.\n\n\"Look, Tom,\" pleaded Roger, \"give me ten minutes. Don't fire for ten\nminutes! I'm going to try an idea. If I'm not successful, then open up\nand blast us back to Mars!\"\n\n\"Roger, wait!\" shouted Tom. \"What's going on? What're you doing on that\nship?\"\n\n\"I can't talk now,\" answered Roger. \"Loring and Mason are on the ship\nwith me. Remember--ten minutes--and if I don't contact you, then open\nfire!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nRoger flipped off the teleceiver. He stared at the darkened screen and\nbegan estimating the chances of success for a plan he had in mind.\nDeciding that, regardless of what happened, he had to take over the\nship, he got up and turned toward the hatch and the gun locker. He\nstopped cold. Loring stood framed in the doorway, a paralo-ray gun in\neach hand.\n\n\"Just stand right where you are, spaceboy!\" snapped Loring. \"You want\nten minutes, huh? Ten minutes for what? I thought there was something\nfunny going on when we missed the _Polaris_ with that bomb!\"\n\n\"You knew all along I didn't have anything to do with that crash back on\nthe station, didn't you?\" shouted Roger. His eyes blazed angrily.\n\n\"Yeah. So what?\" growled Loring. \"Hey, Mason,\" he yelled over his\nshoulder, \"get up here in a hurry! We gotta work fast!\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"You're still valuable to us, Manning,\" said Loring with a crooked grin.\n\"You're going to ensure our getting what we came after!\"\n\nMason stepped through the door. \"Yeah, Loring?\"\n\nLoring quickly told him of Roger's attempt to work with Connel.\n\n\"Take our spaceboy down below and lock him in a storage compartment.\" He\nhanded over one of the paralo-ray guns, and Mason shoved the muzzle into\nRoger's stomach.\n\n\"Get moving, Manning!\" he snarled. \"I'd like nothing better than to let\nyou have it right now!\"\n\nRoger smiled, knowing Mason still harbored a grudge for the beating he\nhad taken earlier on the trip.\n\n\"When you have him locked up, get back on the control deck,\" said\nLoring. \"We're going to do some old-fashioned bargaining with\n'Blast-off' Connel!\"\n\n\"Bargaining?\" exclaimed Roger.\n\n\"Yeah! One slightly used Space Cadet for what we came after--the copper\nsatellite!\"\n\n\"Connel won't bargain,\" said Roger. \"Not for me, not for anything. You\ndon't know him!\"\n\n\"I know this, Manning!\" said Loring. \"I'm going to get on the teleceiver\nand tell Connel that if he doesn't blast away from here _right now_,\nyou're a dead Space Cadet!\" He jerked his head toward the door. \"All\nright, take him below and tell Shinny to stand by on the power deck. In\ncase Connel won't bargain, we'll have to make a run for it!\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Mason as he shoved the paralo-ray gun deeper into Roger's\nstomach. \"Move, Manning!\"\n\nRoger climbed down the ladder and through the long passageway of the\n_Space Devil_. He passed Shinny on the way down.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" demanded Shinny, seeing Mason with the\nparalo-ray gun.\n\n\"We missed with the bomb,\" said Mason, \"and Connel raised ship. He's\nready to blast us if we don't surrender right away. Loring's trying to\nmake a deal with him.\"\n\n\"What kind of a deal?\" asked Shinny.\n\n\"Hot-shot Manning for the satellite!\"\n\n\"He hasn't told you everything, Mr. Shinny,\" said Roger in his casual\ndrawl. \"They are the ones who caused the crash of the _Annie Jones_ and\nthe deaths of Jardine and Bangs. They framed me!\"\n\n\"Then,\" mused Shinny, \"you're cleared?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Mason, \"he's cleared! Cleared for a long swim in space\nif Connel doesn't do what Loring tells him! Get in there!\" Mason shoved\nRoger into the cramped storage compartment. He locked the door and\nturned to Shinny.\n\n\"Loring wants you to stand by the power deck in case Connel won't play\nball. We might have to make a run for it.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" said Shinny, \"I'll stand by the power deck.\"\n\nMason turned and walked away. Shinny followed him, a curious gleam in\nhis eyes.\n\nUp on the control deck, Loring was twisting the dials in front of the\nteleceiver screen.\n\n\"_Space Devil_ to _Polaris_--_Space Devil_ to _Polaris_--come in,\n_Polaris_.\" He twisted another dial and watched the darkened screen\nanxiously. After a moment the screen blurred, and Tom's face gradually\ncame into sharp focus.\n\n\"Loring!\" gasped Tom. \"Where's Roger?\"\n\n\"Never mind him, you punk!\" snarled Loring. \"Tell that fatheaded Connel\nI wanta talk to him! Make it fast!\"\n\nTom's face disappeared to be replaced by the raging features of Major\nConnel. \"You murdering space rat!\" he roared. \"I've given you two\nminutes to surrender and, by the craters of Luna, you've only got thirty\nseconds left!\"\n\n\"It'll only take ten seconds to tell you that if you don't get outta\nhere Cadet Manning gets blasted!\"\n\n\"What?\" roared Connel.\n\n\"That's right,\" snarled Loring. \"You're the one that's got thirty\nseconds to get out of here, or Manning takes a swim in space!\"\n\n\"Why, you--\" Connel's face was twisted with rage. \"You can't threaten\nme!\"\n\n\"I ain't threatening you,\" said Loring, \"_I'm telling you!_ If you don't\nget started, you'll never see Manning again. Or if you do, you won't\nrecognize him! Now make up your mind, Connel!\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer hesitated. \"Give me two minutes,\" he said, \"and\nI'll call you back. Two minutes.\"\n\n\"Two minutes,\" repeated Loring, \"and if I don't hear from you by then,\nor if you try any funny stuff, Manning gets it!\"\n\nAboard the _Polaris_, the screen darkened, and Connel, his fists\nclenched, turned to Tom.\n\n\"We're helpless, Tom,\" he said softly. \"Now that we have proof of\nRoger's innocence, I have to do everything in my power to save him.\"\n\nTom didn't say anything. Suddenly Connel smashed one huge fist into\nanother. \"But by the blessed rings of Saturn, when I _do_ get my hands\non that Loring, I'll--I'll--\" He broke off suddenly and turned back to\nthe teleceiver. \"I'm going to do what he wants, Tom. Roger's life is\nworth a dozen like Loring, and we'll have to take a chance that Loring\nwill keep his word. After all,\" continued the big officer softly, \"our\nmission is complete. We've tested the transmitter and found it to be\nmore than we expected. No real reason why we should stay around here any\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" stammered Tom. \"Sir, I--I--\"\n\nConnel waved him silent with his hand. \"You don't need to say anything,\nTom. It's just one of those things. Still I can't help wondering what\nthey came out here for.\" He turned to the dials on the teleceiver and\nbegan twisting them. \"I'll call him, and you stand by to blast out of\nhere.\"\n\n\nNicholas Shinny sat on the power deck and listened to Loring issue\norders over the intercom.\n\n\"I don't know if Connel will go for it, or not,\" said Loring, \"but just\nin case he doesn't, we gotta get outta here fast! You got that, Shinny?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" answered Shinny, \"I got it!\"\n\n\"Mason,\" yelled Loring, \"you take over on the radar bridge!\"\n\n\"All ready up here,\" said Mason.\n\n\"Well, be sure we've got a clear trajectory out. Better take us into the\nsun Alpha Centauri. That way, maybe they'll miss us on their radar. The\nsun will show all sorts of blips on their screen.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Mason. \"You think he'll go for it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Loring, \"but if he doesn't, it's going to be\nspace dust for Manning.\"\n\nShinny got up and walked around the deserted power deck. His legs felt\nweak. The plan he had made was a desperate one. Over and over, he\nchecked the operation in his mind. It would have to be quick, sure, and\nsudden. That was the only thing that would ensure success. \"Yes, sir,\"\nhe thought, \"if we can surprise 'em, we can get away with it.\" He dug\nout a piece of chewing tobacco, took a bite, eyed the remaining piece,\nand then shoved the whole thing in his mouth. His cheek bulged.\n\nHe went to the intercom and flipped it on. \"Hey, Loring,\" he yelled.\n\"I've got to check the timer on number-three rocket. She's not acting\njust right. It'll take me about a minute.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" came Loring's reply, \"but make it snappy.\"\n\nThe timers were to the left of the control board, but Shinny turned to\nthe right and the ladder leading to the lower deck. He eased the hatch\nopen, glanced around, and then climbed down quickly. He stopped at a\nlocker, opened the doors quietly, and took out two paralo-ray guns and\ntwo rifles. Then, closing the doors, he made his way to the opposite\nside of the ship.\n\n\"Hey, Manning!\" he whispered through the closed storeroom hatch. \"Can ya\nhear me?\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Me--Shinny,\" hissed the wizened spaceman. He opened the hatch and Roger\nquickly stepped out.\n\n\"What's the idea?\" gasped Roger when Shinny shoved a rifle and pistol\ninto his hands.\n\n\"I ain't got time to explain now,\" said Shinny. \"We've got to hurry if\nwe're going to take over this tub.\"\n\nRoger's eyes glowed. \"You mean--\"\n\n\"Never mind what I mean,\" said Shinny. \"Just listen. Loring's on the\ncontrol deck and Mason's on the radar bridge. Loring's just talked to\nConnel. He's trying to make him blast outta here. If Connel doesn't,\nLoring's going to dump you in space!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. That murdering space crawler!\" snarled Roger. He gripped\nthe rifle tightly. \"I'll blast him--\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" hissed Shinny. \"You go up and get Loring, see? Make\nit look like you got out by yourself. If you can handle him, O.K. I'll\nstay in back, and if anything goes wrong, I'll back you up!\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Roger. He patted the spaceman on the back and smiled.\n\"Don't worry, Mr. Shinny, nothing will go wrong!\"\n\n\"Watch your step. That Loring is a smart cookie!\"\n\nRoger turned into the passageway and made his way silently to the\ncontrol-deck hatch. He peered around the edge of the hatch and saw\nLoring sitting in front of the teleceiver screen, his back toward Roger.\nThe cadet quickly stepped into the control room, leveled the rifle, and\nsaid quietly, \"All right, Loring, keep your hands in view!\"\n\nLoring spun around and stared openmouthed at Roger. \"Mann--\" he gasped.\n\n\"Yeah, me!\" said Roger. \"Call Mason and tell him to come down here on\nthe double. But one wrong move, Loring, and I'll give you a quick freeze\nwith this ray gun!\"\n\nMoving slowly, Loring turned to the intercom and flipped the switch.\n\"Hey, Mason,\" he yelled. \"Come down here a minute, will ya?\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" growled Mason. \"I've got to figure out this course.\"\n\nRoger stepped close to Loring, raising the gun.\n\nLoring licked his lips and turned back to the intercom. \"Don't gimme any\nback talk! I said get down here!\"\n\nSuddenly the teleceiver came to life. \"_Polaris_ to _Space Devil_! Come\nin, Loring! This is Major Connel on the _Polaris_ calling Loring on the\n_Space Devil_!\"\n\nThe suddenness of the voice startled Roger, and for a split second he\ntook his eyes off Loring. In that instant Loring leaped for the boy,\ngrabbing at the rifle. The quickness of his lunge caught Roger off guard\nand he was thrown back against the bulkhead, but he held onto the rifle\nas Loring tried to twist it out of his grasp.\n\n\"What th--\" cried Mason from the ladder leading to the radar bridge.\nWhen he saw Roger and Loring struggling, he grabbed for the paralo-ray\ngun at his side. Just at that moment Shinny stepped through the hatch\nand fired his rifle. Mason was frozen into a rigid statue, unable to\nmove.\n\n\"All right, Loring,\" yelled Shinny, \"step back or I'll blast you like I\ndid Mason!\"\n\nRoger wrenched the rifle out of Loring's grasp and stepped back. \"Good\nwork, Mr. Shinny!\" he said to the little spaceman. \"You sure figured it\nright!\"\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is Connel on the _Polaris_. Come in,\nLoring ...\"\n\nShinny looked over at Roger and winked. \"Better answer him, while I get\nthis joker locked up.\" He motioned to Loring who stood backed up against\nthe bulkhead, his hands high over his head.\n\n\"You dirty double-crossing space rat!\" he snarled at Shinny.\n\n\"Now, now, none of that,\" said Shinny, leveling the rifle. \"If you get\ntoo noisy, I'll freeze you like I did Mason to keep your trap shut!\"\n\nLoring cast a sidelong glance at Mason, who stood as if carved out of\nmarble. The effects of the ray blast were devastating, having paralyzed\nhis entire nervous system. While the victim was still able to breathe\nand his heartbeat remained normal, he was unable to move so much as an\neyelid. The gun was developed after all lethal weapons had been outlawed\nby the Solar Alliance. Though any victim could be released from its\nparalyzing effect by a neutralizing charge from the same gun, while\nunder its power the victim was reduced to a state of mild hysteria. He\nwas able to hear, see, and think, but not to act. When released, it was\nnot unusual to see a man crumple to the floor from exhaustion.\n\n[Illustration: _Mason was frozen into a rigid statue, unable to move_]\n\nLoring marched meekly in front of Shinny to the storage room that had\nheld Roger. The cadet spaceman remained on the control deck. He twisted\nthe dials of the teleceiver and spoke into the mike.\n\n\"_Space Devil_ to Major Connel. Come in! This is Manning on the _Space\nDevil_ calling Major Connel ...\"\n\n\"Manning!\" shouted Connel. \"I thought you were a prisoner!\"\n\n\"Ah, it was nothing, skipper,\" said Roger blandly. \"I just took over the\nship--with a little help, of course!\"\n\n\"A little help?\" asked Connel. \"From whom?\"\n\nRoger then gave the officer a complete review of what had happened to\nhim since leaving the space station, finishing with Shinny's aid in his\nescape.\n\n\"Why would he want to help you?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Well, never mind,\" said Connel. \"I suppose you two can handle that ship\nall right between you. Land on Tara as soon as you can. I'll get the\ndetails then!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Roger. Then, just before breaking contact, he\nyelled into the mike, \"Hey, Astro--Tom! See ya in a few minutes!\"\n\nAs the teleceiver screen darkened, Shinny reappeared. He had released\nMason from the effects of the ray charge, and both Mason and Loring were\nsafe in the storage room. He walked over and slapped Roger on the back.\n\n\"Well, it looks like we did it, sonny boy!\" he said.\n\nRoger turned to look at the wizened spaceman who still was chewing on\nthe plug of tobacco. \"What made you do this for me, Mr. Shinny?\" asked\nRoger quietly.\n\n\"Tell ya a little secret,\" said Shinny, with a merry twinkle in his eye.\n\"I was in the Solar Guard for twenty years. Enlisted man. Got into an\naccident and hurt my leg, but it wasn't in the line of duty, so I was\ntossed out without a pension. Ever since then I been kinda bitter, you\nmight say. And, strangely enough, it was Major Connel that kicked me\nout.\"\n\n\"But you--you--\" gasped Roger.\n\n\"Let's just say,\" said Shinny with a smile, \"that once you're a Solar\nGuardsman, you're always a Guardsman. Now, how about getting this wagon\ndown to Tara?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, sure,\" said Roger absently, his eyes trailing after the\nsmall limping figure. Once a Solar Guardsman, always a Guardsman, he\nthought. Smiling, he turned to the control board. He felt the same way.\nHe was a Guardsman, and it was good to be back home!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\nMajor Connel paced nervously in front of the group of spacemen. Tom,\nRoger, Astro, Alfie, and Mr. Shinny were lounging around the small\nclearing between the _Polaris_ and the _Space Devil_. A piece of thin\nspace cloth had been stretched between the two ships to shield the men\nfrom the blazing sun. Connel stopped in front of Roger and Shinny.\n\n\"And you say the satellite is three-quarters solid copper?\" asked\nConnel.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Roger, \"at least that's what Loring and Mason told\nus.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" asked Connel. \"I mean, where exactly?\"\n\n\"I spotted her coming in, sir,\" replied Roger. \"I'd say she was about\nthree hundred thousand miles outside of Tara in perfect orbit.\"\n\n\"By the blessed rings of Saturn,\" exclaimed Connel, \"it's almost too\ngood to be true! The whole Solar Alliance needs copper desperately. And\nif what you say is true, that's enough to last for a hundred and fifty\nyears!\"\n\n\"Didn't you have any idea they discovered it, sir?\" asked Tom. \"I mean,\nwhen they took that unauthorized flight on your first trip out here?\"\n\n\"Didn't suspect a thing, Tom,\" replied Connel. \"I thought they had\ngotten a little space rocky on some homemade rocket juice and just went\non a wingding. Imagine the colossal nerve of those two wanting to corner\nthe market with the largest deposit of copper ever found.\"\n\n\"How do you plan to get it back, Major?\" asked Shinny.\n\n\"I don't know, Shinny--\"\n\n\"_Mr._ Shinny!\" snapped the wizened spaceman. \"_I'm_ not one of your\ncadets!\"\n\n\"Still the hotheaded rocket buster, eh?\" asked Connel, eying the\ntoothless spaceman. \"It was the same thing that got you kicked out of\nthe Solar Guard twenty years ago!\"\n\n\"Wasn't either! And you know it!\" snapped Shinny. \"You retired me\nbecause I busted my leg!\"\n\n\"That helped,\" said Connel, \"but the main reason was because you were\ntoo hotheaded. Couldn't take orders!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Shinny doggedly, \"I ain't in no Solar Guard now, and when\nyou talk to me, it's _Mr._ Shinny!\"\n\n\"Why, you old goat!\" exploded Connel. \"I ought to arrest you for aiding\ncriminals!\"\n\n\"You can't do a thing to me,\" barked Shinny. \"Prospecting is\nprospecting, whether it's in the asteroid belt or out here on Tara!\"\n\nUnable to hold back any longer, the four space cadets suddenly roared\nwith laughter at the sight of the two old space foes jawing at each\nother. Actually, Connel and Shinny were glad to see each other. And when\nthey saw the boys doubled up with laughter, they couldn't help laughing\nalso. Finally Connel turned to Roger.\n\n\"Can you find that satellite again?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Roger grinned.\n\n\"All right, then,\" said Connel finally, \"let's go take a look at it. I\nstill won't believe it until I see it!\"\n\n\"Who's hardheaded now?\" snorted Shinny, climbing into the _Polaris_.\n\nLater, as the rocket cruiser blasted smoothly through space, Connel\njoined Roger and Alfie on the radar deck. The two cadets were bent over\nthe radar scanner.\n\n\"Pick her up yet?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"There she is, right there, sir,\" said Roger, placing a finger on a\ncircular white blip on the scanner. \"But the magnascope shows pretty\nrugged country. I think we'd better take a look on the opposite side.\nMaybe we can find a better place to touch down.\"\n\n\"Very well, Manning,\" replied Connel. \"Do what you think best. Tell Tom\nto land as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\nLeaving Alfie on watch at the scanner, Roger hurried down the ladder to\nthe control deck where Tom was seated in front of the great board.\n\n\"Tom,\" called Roger, walking up behind his unit-mate, \"we're going to\ntake a look at this baby on the other side. See if we can't find a\nbetter place to touch down. Stand by to pick up the surface of the\nsatellite on the teleceiver as soon as we get close enough.\"\n\n\"O.K., Roger,\" said Tom. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Down to Loring and Mason in the cooler! I want to see their faces when\nI tell them they finally are getting where they wanted to go, but under\nslightly different circumstances!\"\n\nTom laughed and turned back to the board. \"Power deck, check in!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye,\" replied Astro. \"When do we set down on the precious\nrock, Tom?\" asked the Venusian.\n\n\"Should be soon, Astro,\" said Tom. \"Better stand by for maneuvering.\"\n\n\"Right!\" replied Astro.\n\nTom turned his full attention to the control board and the teleceiver\nscreen above his head. He was happier than he had ever been in his life.\nThe report sent back to Space Academy by Major Connel had been answered\nwith a commendation to both Roger and Shinny for capturing Loring and\nMason. With Roger back in the unit, Tom was at peace. Even Alfie was\noverjoyed at seeing Roger back aboard the _Polaris_.\n\nAnd Tom had noticed that Major Connel was beginning to call them by\ntheir first names!\n\n\"Radar deck to control deck!\" said Alfie. \"From casual observations,\nTom, the surface of the far side of the satellite is more suitable for a\ntouchdown. I would suggest you observe the planetoid yourself with the\nmagnascope and draw your own conclusions.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" replied Tom. He switched the teleceiver screen on to the more\npowerful magnascope and studied the surface of the small celestial body.\nHe saw a deep valley with a flat hard surface set between two tall\ncliffs. It would be a tricky spot for a landing, but it looked like the\nbest place available. Tom snapped open the intercom.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Stand by for touchdown. Power deck stand by for\ndeceleration. Radar bridge stand by for range and altitude checks!\"\nSharply, crisply, Tom's orders crackled through the ship.\n\nWorking together with the ease and thoroughness of men well acquainted\nwith their jobs, Astro and Shinny on the power deck, Roger and Alfie on\nthe radar bridge, and Tom on the control deck handling the delicate\nmaneuvering, combined to bring the great ship to a safe landing on the\ndry valley floor of the satellite.\n\n\"Touchdown!\" yelled Tom and began securing the ship. Two minutes later\nthe entire crew faced Major Connel for briefing.\n\n\"We'll all go out to different parts of the satellite and make\ngeological tests,\" announced Connel. \"We'll pair off, two to a jet boat.\nAstro and Roger, Alfie and Mr. Shinny, Tom and myself. This is a simple\ntest.\" He held up a delicate instrument and a vial full of colorless\nliquid. \"You simply pour a little of this liquid, about a spoonful, on\nthe ground, wait about five minutes, and then stick the end of this into\nthe spot where you poured the liquid.\" He held up a two-foot steel shaft\na quarter inch in diameter, fastened to a clock-face gauge with numbers\nfrom one to a thousand. The other end of the shaft was needle sharp.\n\"When you stick this into the ground, there'll be a reading on the\nmeter. Relay it to me. This way well get an estimate of the amount of\ncopper in a three-mile area for a depth of a hundred feet. It must be\nmore than two hundred tons per square mile to make it worth while!\"\n\nHe held up the testing equipment for all to see and explained its use\nonce more. Then, giving each team a kit, he ordered them to the jet\nboats.\n\nJust before the crew of Earthmen left the _Polaris_, Connel gave them\nlast-minute instructions.\n\n\"Report back to the _Polaris_ in one hour. Make as many tests as you can\nover as wide an area as possible. Don't forget to leave one man in the\njet boat while the other is making the test. Keep your audio\ncommunicator in the jet boat on at all times. And be sure your belt\ncommunicator is always open. Check your oxygen supply and space suits.\nAll clear?\"\n\nOne by one, the spacemen checked in through the audio communicators that\nall was clear. The sliding hatch on the side of the _Polaris_ was\nopened, and the jet boats blasted out into the brilliant sunlight of\nAlpha Centauri, going in three different directions.\n\nTom piloted his small craft over the rugged surface of the satellite,\ncircling the larger peaks and swooping into the small valleys. Connel\nwould indicate when it was time to stop, and Tom would set the craft\ndown. While Connel made the tests, Tom would talk to the others over the\naudio communicators. The three small ships covered the satellite quickly\nin evenly divided sections, reporting their readings on the needlelike\ninstrument to Connel, who kept recording the reports on a pad at his\nknee.\n\nAn hour later the boats returned to the _Polaris_ and the Earthmen\nassembled in the control room. Connel, Tom, and Alfie were busy reducing\nthe readings of the tests into recognizable copper ton estimates per\nsquare mile.\n\nFinally Connel turned around, wiped his brow, and faced the others.\n\n\"This is one of the greatest discoveries for Earthmen since they learned\nhow to blast off!\" The big officer paused and then held up the results\nof the tests. \"This satellite is _really_ three-quarters solid copper!\"\n\nThere was a loud mumble as everyone began talking at once.\n\n\"How are we going to get it back home, sir?\" asked Tom. \"Wouldn't\nhauling it back in spaceships cost too much?\"\n\n\"Yes, it would, Corbett,\" answered Connel, \"but I've got an idea how we\ncan lick that problem.\"\n\n\"Can't see how you can lick it,\" snorted Shinny, \"unless you take the\nwhole blasted satellite back!\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I'm going to do!\" answered Connel.\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed Roger, momentarily forgetting he was addressing a\nsenior officer. \"How in blazes are you going to do that?\"\n\nConnel turned to the chart-screen projector and switched it on.\nImmediately an image of Earth and its Moon, and much farther away the\nsun, was visible. Connel stepped to the screen and pointed to Moon.\n\n\"The Moon is a captive satellite of Earth, revolving around Earth the\nsame way Earth revolves around the sun. It's the same situation we have\nhere. This satellite is a captive of Tara, and Tara is a captive of\nAlpha Centauri. The difference is that the satellite is a peanut\ncompared in size to the Moon, being only about fifteen miles in\ndiameter. I'm not sure, but I think I can get enough reactant energy out\nof the _Space Devil's_ fuel supply to blast the satellite out of Tara's\ngrip and send it back to our solar system in one piece!\"\n\n\"You mean, sir,\" asked Tom, perplexed, \"you'll tear the satellite out of\nTara's gravitational pull?\"\n\n\"That's right, Tom,\" replied Connel, \"using the same principle to clear\ngravity that we use on the _Polaris_ or any spaceship. Enough power from\nthe rockets will blast the _Polaris_ off Tara. Well, if you can get\nenough power, you can blast this satellite out of Tara's grip also,\nsince the only thing holding it here is the gravity of Tara--the same\nthing that holds the Moon in orbit around Earth!\"\n\nAstro's eyes bulged. He looked at Connel blankly. \"Why, sir,\" he\nstammered, \"it'd take--take--a _ton_ of reactant fuel to pull something\nthat size away from Tara. The _Polaris_ is a kiddy car in comparison!\"\n\n\"You're right, Astro,\" said Connel, \"but there's one thing you've\nforgotten. The copper of the satellite itself. That's going to be the\nmain source of power. The reactant fuel from the _Space Devil_ will\nserve only as a starter, a trigger, you might say, to make use of the\ncopper as fuel!\"\n\nOnce again Astro gasped. \"Then--then--there isn't anything to stop you,\nsir,\" he finished slowly.\n\nConnel smiled. \"I know there isn't. I'm going to contact Space Academy\nnow for permission to pitch the biggest ball in the history of man!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\n\"Well, I'll be a star-gazing lunatic!\" exclaimed Roger a few minutes\nlater. \"You really think that you can blast this satellite out of its\norbit?\"\n\n\"Not only that, Manning,\" said Connel with a smile, \"but I might be able\nto get it back to our sun faster than we could get back ourselves.\"\n\n\"Why that would be the biggest project ever attempted by man, sir,\" said\nTom. \"You'd be transporting an entire satellite from one star system to\nanother!\"\n\n\"That's right, Corbett,\" said Connel. \"I've just finished talking to\nSpace Academy and they've given me permission to do anything I think\nnecessary to accomplish just that. Now pay close attention to me, all of\nyou. We haven't much time.\"\n\nTom, Roger, Astro, Alfie, and Mr. Shinny gathered in a close circle\naround the major on the control deck of the _Polaris_ and watched him as\nhe drew several rough diagrams on a piece of paper.\n\n\"Getting the satellite back is the trickiest part of the whole\noperation. Astro, are you sure you made a correct estimate on the amount\nof reactant fuel in the _Space Devil_?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Astro. \"I checked it four times, and Mr. Shinny\nchecked it, too!\"\n\n\"All right, then, listen,\" said Connel. \"I've given the satellite a\nname. From now on we call it Junior. And this will be known as Junior's\nPitch! I've explained how Junior is a captive satellite revolving around\nTara, the same way our Moon revolves around Earth. We have two problems.\nOne is to blast it out of Tara's grip. And the other is to take\nadvantage of Tara's orbital speed around its sun Alpha Centauri, _and_\nJunior's orbital speed around Tara. We've got to combine the velocities\nof the orbits, so that when we do spring Junior loose, he'll gain in\nspeed!\"\n\n\"But how do we get the orbital speeds to help us, Major?\" asked Alfie.\nHis glasses had slipped to the very end of his nose.\n\n\"If you'd give the major a chance, he'd tell you, Big Brain,\" drawled\nRoger. Alfie gave Roger a withering look and turned back to the major.\n\n\"Do you remember when you were kids and tied a rock on the end of a rope\nand then swung it around your head?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Sure, sorta like a slingshot,\" said Astro.\n\n\"That's right, Astro,\" said Connel, \"and if you released the rope, the\nrock would fly in the direction it was headed, _when you let go_!\"\n\n\"I get it,\" cried Tom excitedly. \"The gravity of Tara is the rope\nholding Junior--ah\"--he fumbled--\"making it swing around!\"\n\n\"And the reactant power of the _Space Devil_ placed in the right spot\nwould be the trigger to make it let go!\" commented Roger.\n\n\"It's as simple as that, boys!\" said Connel with a smile.\n\n\"But how in the blazing beams of the sun are you going to _stop_ that\nblasted thing when you get it rolling?\" asked Shinny.\n\n\"The chances of Junior hitting anything on the way home are so small it\ndoesn't present a problem. So we just aim Junior for our solar system!\nLater on, arrangements can be made to steer it into an orbit around our\nsun.\"\n\n\"You know,\" wheezed Shinny, his merry eyes twinkling, \"that sounds\npretty neat!\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied Connel. He leaned against the control-board desk top\nand folded his arms across his massive chest. He looked at each of the\ncadets and Shinny a long time before speaking. Finally he stepped\nforward and stood among them, turning now and then to speak directly to\neach of them.\n\n\"We have only four days, five hours, and some few minutes to pull Junior\nout of Tara's grip, and later, the grip of Alpha Centauri. You boys will\nhave to work as you've never worked before. You'll do things you never\ndreamed you could do. You'll work until your brains ache and your bodies\nscream. But when you're finished, you will have accomplished one of\nman's greatest challenges. You're going to do all this because I know\nyou can--and I'm going to see that you do! Is that clear?\"\n\nThere was a barely audible \"Yes, sir\" from the cadets.\n\n\"The six of us, working together, are going to send a hunk of copper\nfifteen miles in diameter hurtling through twenty-three million million\nmiles of space, so let's get that ball rolling. _Right now!_\"\n\nWith Major Connel roaring, pleading, and blasting, four young cadets and\na derelict spaceman began the monumental task of assembling the mass of\ninformation necessary for the satellite's big push through space. During\nthe three days that their project had been under way, Tom, Roger,\nAstro, Alfie, and Mr. Shinny worked, as Major Connel promised, as they\nhad never worked before.\n\nLate in the afternoon of the third day Connel stepped through the hatch\nof the control deck where Tom was busy over a table of ratios for\nbalancing the amount of thrust from each of the reactant-power units.\nThe power units were to give Junior its initial thrust out of the\ngravity of Tara.\n\n\"Well, Corbett,\" asked Connel, \"how're you making out with the ratios?\"\n\n\"I've finished them, sir,\" replied Tom, looking up at the major. His\nface was drawn, his eyes red from lack of sleep. \"But I just can't seem\nto get a time for escaping the orbit on a true tangent.\"\n\n\"Have you tried making an adjustment for the overall pull of both\ncomponents?\" asked Connel. \"That of Tara and of Alpha Centauri on\nJunior?\" He picked up the paper Tom had been working on and glanced over\nthe figures.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom, \"but I still can't seem to make it come out\nright!\"\n\n\"You'll get it, Tom,\" said Connel. \"Go over it again. But remember.\nTime's running out. Just one day and about twenty hours left.\" Connel's\nvoice was friendly--more friendly than at any time Tom could remember.\nHe smiled, and taking a fresh sheet of paper, he began the complicated\ncalculations of escape time all over again.\n\nConnel slipped out of the control room and went below to the power deck,\nwhere Astro and Mr. Shinny had been working without sleep for over fifty\nhours. When Connel slipped into the room he found the two men puzzling\nover a drawing board.\n\n\"What seems to be the trouble, Astro?\" asked Connel.\n\nAstro turned, startled. \"We've tried building that lead baffle for the\nreactant units five times now, sir,\" said Astro. \"We're having a hard\ntime getting the correct amount of reactant power we need in a unit this\nsmall.\"\n\n\"Maybe you're trying to make it _too_ small, Astro,\" commented Connel,\nlooking over the drawing. \"Remember, this unit has but one job. To\n_start_ the reaction. When the reaction fuel gets hot enough, it'll\nstart a reaction of the copper on Junior and sustain itself. Try a\nsmaller amount of the reactant. But whatever you do, keep working. Only\na day and a few hours left.\"\n\nConnel looked at Shinny. \"Keep him working, Mr. Shinny,\" he ordered. \"I\nknow he can do it. Just keep him going.\"\n\nShinny grinned and nodded.\n\n\"I'll try, sir,\" said Astro, shaking his head, \"but I won't guarantee\nit--\"\n\nConnel cut him off with a roar. \"Cadet Astro, I don't want your\nguarantee! _I want that unit. Now build it!_\"\n\nHour after hour the cadets racked their brains for what seemed like\nimpossible answers to an impossible task. Working until their eyes\nclosed fast shut, they would lie down right where they were--power deck,\ncontrol deck, or radar bridge--and sleep. They would awake, still\ngroggy, drink hot tea, eat cold sandwiches, and continue their struggle\nwith time and astrophysics.\n\nOne by one, the problems were solved and set aside for newer ones that\narose on the way. Each cadet worked in his particular field, and all of\ntheir information was assembled and co-ordinated by Major Connel. More\nthan once, Connel had found the clever minds of his cadets reaching for\nanswers to questions he knew would have troubled the professors back at\nSpace Academy. Connel, his eye on the clock, his sharp tongue lashing\nout when he thought he detected unclear thinking, raced from one\ndepartment to another while the incessant work continued. On the morning\nof the fourth day he walked into the radar bridge where Roger and Alfie\nhad been working steadily for seventy-two hours on an electronic fuse to\ntrigger the reactant units.\n\n\"There you are, skipper,\" said Roger. \"The fuse is all yours. Delivered\ntwelve hours ahead of time!\"\n\n\"Good work, Roger. You too, Alfie. Excellent!\" said Connel, his eyes\nappraising the fuse.\n\n\"Ah, that's nothing, skipper,\" said Roger with a smile. \"Anyone could\nhave done it with Alfie here to help. He's got a brain like a\ncalculator!\"\n\n\"Now, I want to see how smart you two really are!\" said Connel.\n\n\"Huh?\" asked Roger stupidly. Alfie had slumped to the deck, holding his\nhead in his hands.\n\n\"I want a communications unit,\" said Connel, \"that can send out a\nconstant beam, a signal Space Academy can pick up to follow Junior in\ntransit back to Earth.\"\n\n\"In twelve hours?\" exploded Roger. \"Impossible, skipper!\"\n\n\"_Cadet Manning_,\" roared Connel, \"I don't want your _opinion_, I asked\nfor that _unit_!\"\n\n\"But one day, sir,\" said Roger. \"Not even a day. Twelve hours. I can't,\nsir. I'm sorry. I'm so tired I can't see straight.\"\n\nAlfie let out a low moan.\n\nConnel studied the two cadets. He was aware that he had already asked\nthem to do the impossible, and they had done it. And they deserved to be\nlet alone. But Major Connel wasn't himself unless he had given every\nounce of energy he had left, or the energy left in those around him. He\npatted Roger on the shoulder and spoke softly.\n\n\"Roger, did I ever tell you that I think you have one of the finest\nbrains for electronics I've ever seen? And that Alfie is sure to have a\nbrilliant future in astrophysics?\"\n\nRoger stammered. \"Why--ah--thank you, sir--\"\n\nAlfie looked up at Connel and then struggled to his feet.\n\n\"You know, Roger,\" he said haltingly, \"if we took that unit we came out\nhere to test--you know, the transmitter unit--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nRoger cut him off. \"Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. We could\nborrow some of the reaction mass that Astro got out of the _Space\nDevil_ and use that as a power source.\"\n\nConnel backed away from the two cadets and tiptoed off the bridge. He\nsmiled to himself. He was going to win his race with time yet! And he\nwas going to do it because he had learned long before that you could\nonly push a man so far, then you had to sit down, pat him on the back,\ntell him how smart he was, and he would push himself. Connel almost\nlaughed out loud.\n\nSix hours later Connel sat in his quarters puzzling over one of the many\nminor problems of Junior's Pitch when he heard footsteps behind him. He\nturned. Astro, Tom, Roger, Alfie, and Shinny walked silently into the\nroom. Connel stared.\n\n\"Wha--what is it?\" he demanded.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"We're finished, sir,\" said Tom simply.\n\n\"Finished?\" exploded Connel. \"You mean--\"\n\n\"That's what he means, skipper,\" said Shinny. His eyes were bloodshot\nfor want of sleep, but there was a merry twinkle left tugging at the\ncorners.\n\n\"Everything?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Everything, sir,\" said Roger. \"The power units are built and the fuses\ninstalled. All it needs is to be set. Tom's worked out the ratios and\nthe amount of reactant fuel needed in each unit for escape tangent. The\nescape time, combining orbital speeds of Tara and Junior, are completed,\nand we have six hours and fifty-five minutes before blast-off!\" He\nturned and rumpled Alfie's hair. \"Alfie and I have completed the\ncommunications unit and have tested it. Junior is ready to get his big\nkick in the pants!\"\n\nConnel stood up. He was speechless. It was almost too much to believe.\n\n\"_Get below_,\" he roared, \"and go to sleep! If I catch one of you awake\nin five minutes, I'll log you fifty demerits!\"\n\nThe tired workers grinned back at their commander.\n\n\"I'll get everything set,\" said Connel, \"and wake you up an hour before\nwe have to get things ready. Now _hit the sack!_\"\n\nTheir grins spreading even wider on their haggard faces, they turned\naway. Connel stepped to the desk on the control deck and wrote across\nthe face of the logbook page.\n\n\"... October 2nd, 2353. Space Cadets Corbett, Manning, Astro, and\nHiggins and ex-enlisted spaceman Nicholas Shinny completed this day all\npreparation for operation Junior's Pitch. By authority vested in me as\nSenior Officer, Solar Guard, I hereby recommend official commendation\nof \"_well done_\" to the above-mentioned spacemen, and that all honors\npursuant to that commendation be officially bestowed on them. Signed,\nConnel, Major, SO--SG ...\"\n\nHe closed the book and wiped the corners of his eyes with the back of\nhis hand.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\n\"Well, fellows,\" said Tom, stifling a yawn, \"it looks like we did it.\nBut I could use some more sleep. That five hours was just enough to get\nstarted on!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger sourly, \"but where does this Venusian lummox get\noff grabbing all the credit.\" He looked at Astro. \"If I hadn't built the\nfuses for your little firecrackers--\"\n\n\"_Firecrackers!_\" yelped Astro. \"Why, you skinny space fake! If I hadn't\nbuilt those nuclear reactors, _you_ wouldn't have anything to set off!\"\n\nConnel appeared in the small messroom of the _Polaris_, his hands full\nof papers and drawings. \"When you've finished congratulating each other,\nI'd like to say a few things!\" he snapped.\n\n\"Congratulate _him_?\" exclaimed Roger. \"Skipper, his head's so thick,\nthe noise on the power deck can't even reach his eardrums!\"\n\n\"Just one more word, Manning,\" growled Astro, \"and I'll take a deep\nbreath and blow you away!\"\n\n\"_One more word out of either of you_,\" roared Connel, \"and I'll throw\nyou both in the brig with Mason and Loring!\"\n\nSuddenly he glared at the five spacemen. \"Who's on prisoner watch\ntoday?\" he asked.\n\nThe four cadets and Mr. Shinny looked at each other then at Roger.\n\n\"Uhhh--I am, sir,\" Roger confessed.\n\n\"I had a sneaking suspicion you would be!\" said Connel. \"Cadet Manning,\none of the first things an officer of the Solar Guard learns is to care\nfor the needs of his men and prisoners before himself. Did you know\nthat, Cadet Manning?\"\n\n\"Uhhh--yes, sir. I was just going to--\" mumbled Roger.\n\n\"Then go below and see that Mason and Loring get their rations!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger. He got up and collected a tray of food.\n\n\"All of you report to the control deck in five minutes for briefing,\"\nsaid Connel and followed Roger out of the door.\n\n\"How do you like that?\" said Astro. \"We break our backs for the guy and\nwe're no sooner finished then he starts the old routine again!\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it, Astro,\" said Tom. \"Put yourself in his\nposition. We've only got one or two things to think about. He's\nresponsible for it all.\"\n\n\"Just like he was when I sailed with him twenty-five years ago,\" said\nShinny. He swallowed the remains of his tea and reached for a plug of\ntobacco. \"He's all spaceman from the top of his head to the bottom of\nhis space boots.\"\n\n\"I'm rather inclined to agree with you, Tom,\" said Alfie mildly.\n\"Leadership carries with it the greatest of all burdens--responsibility\nfor other peoples' lives. You, Corbett, as a control-deck cadet, would\ndo well to mark Major Connel's pattern of behavior.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" growled Astro, \"if Tom ever turned out to be a rocket buster\nlike Connel--I'd--I'd--\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Astro,\" Tom said, laughing. \"I don't think there'll be\nanother Major Connel in a million light years!\"\n\nShinny laughed silently, his small frame shaking slightly. \"Say it\nagain, Tommy. Not in the whole universe will there ever be another like\nold 'Blast-off' Connel!\"\n\nOn the deck below the messroom, Roger, balancing a tray carefully on one\nhand, opened the electronic lock of the brig and then stepped back\nquickly, leveling a paralo-ray gun.\n\n\"All right, Mason, Loring,\" he yelled, \"come and get it!\" The door slid\nopen, and Loring stuck his head out. \"Any funny business,\" Roger warned,\n\"and I'll stiffen you so fast, you won't know what hit you!\"\n\n\"It's about time you showed up!\" growled Loring. \"Whaddaya trying to do,\nstarve us to death?\"\n\n\"That's not a bad idea!\" said Roger. Loring took the tray. Roger\nmotioned him back inside the brig and slammed the door shut. He locked\nit and leaned against the grille.\n\n\"Better eat it while you can,\" he said. \"They don't serve it so fancy on\na prison asteroid.\"\n\n\"You'll never get us on a prison asteroid,\" whined Mason.\n\n\"Don't kid yourself,\" said Roger. \"As soon as we get the reactor units\nset, we're going to send this hunk of copper back to Earth and then take\nyou back. They'll bury you!\"\n\n\"Who's going to do all that?\" snapped Loring. \"A bunch of punk kids and\na loudmouthed Solar Guard officer?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" retorted Roger.\n\n\"_Cadet Manning!_\" Connel's voice roared over the intercom. \"You were\nordered to report to the control deck in five minutes! You are already\none minute late! Report to the control deck on the double and _I mean\ndouble!_\"\n\nLoring and Mason laughed. \"Old 'Blast-off' Connel's really got your\nnumber, eh, kid?\"\n\n\"Ah, rocket off, you pinheaded piece of space junk! It didn't take him\nlong to dampen _your_ tubes!\"\n\nConnel roared again. \"_Blast your hide, Manning, report!_\"\n\n\"Better raise ship, Manning,\" said Loring, \"you might get another nasty\ndemerit!\"\n\nRoger turned away and raced to the control deck. He entered breathlessly\nand stood beside his unit-mates while Connel eyed him coldly.\n\n\"Thank you, Cadet Manning,\" said Connel. \"We appreciate your being\nhere!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" mumbled Roger.\n\n\"All right,\" barked Connel, \"you know your assignments. We'll take the\njet boats as before and go out in pairs. Tom and myself, Astro and\nRoger, and Shinny and Alfie. We'll set up the reaction charges on Junior\nat the points marked on the chart screen here.\" He indicated the chart\non the projection. \"Copy them down on your own charts. Each team will\ntake three of the reaction units. My team will set up at points one,\ntwo, and three. Astro and Roger at four, five, and six. Alfie and Shinny\nat seven, eight, and nine. After you've set up the charges, attach the\ntriggers for the fuses and return to the ship. Watch your timing! If we\nfail, it'll be more than a year before Junior will be in the same\norbital position again. How much time do we have left, Corbett?\"\n\nTom glanced at the clock. \"Exactly two hours, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Not much,\" said Connel, \"but enough. It shouldn't take more than an\nhour and a half to set up the units and get back to the ship to blast\noff. All clear? Any questions?\"\n\nThere were no questions.\n\n\"All right,\" said the officer, \"put on your space gear and move out!\"\n\nHandling the lead-encased charges carefully, the six spacemen loaded the\njet boats and, one by one, blasted off from the _Polaris_ to positions\nmarked on the map.\n\nWorking rapidly, each of the teams of two moved from one position to\nanother on the surface of the desolate satellite. Connel, referring\nconstantly to his watch, counted the minutes as one by one the teams\nreported the installation of a reactor unit.\n\n\"This is Shinny. Just finished installing reaction charge one at point\nseven ...\"\n\n\"This is Manning. Just finished installing reaction charge at point four\n...\"\n\nOne after the other, the teams reported. Connel, with Tom piloting the\njet boat, finished setting up their units at points one, two, and three\nand headed back to the _Polaris_.\n\n\"How much time, sir?\" asked Tom as he slowed the small craft for a\nlanding.\n\n\"Less than a half hour, Corbett,\" said Connel nervously. \"I'd better\ncheck on Shinny and Alfie.\" He called into the audiophone. \"Major Connel\nto Shinny and Higgins, come in Shinny--Higgins!\"\n\n\"Shinny here!\" came the reply. \"We're just finishing up the last unit.\nShould be back in five minutes.\"\n\n\"Make it snappy!\" said Connel. \"Less than a half hour left!\"\n\n\"We'll make it,\" snorted Shinny.\n\n\"Coming in for a touchdown,\" said Tom. \"Better strap in, sir!\"\n\nConnel nodded. He laced several straps across his lap and chest,\ngripping the sides of the seat. Tom sent the jet boat in a swooping\ndive, cut the acceleration, and brought the small ship smoothly inside\nthe huge air lock in the side of the _Polaris_.\n\n\"I'd better get right up on the control deck and start warming up the\ncircuits, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Good idea, Tom,\" said Connel. \"I'll try and pick up Manning and Astro.\"\n\nTom left the officer huddling over the communicator in the jet boat.\n\n\"Major Connel to Manning and Astro, come in!\" called Connel. He waited\nfor a moment and then repeated. \"Manning--Astro, come in! By the rings\nof Saturn, come in!\" There was the loud roar of an approaching jet boat.\nShinny guided the ship into the _Polaris_ with a quick violent blast of\nthe braking rockets. The noise was deafening.\n\n\"Belay that noise, you blasted space-brained idiot!\" roared Connel. \"Cut\nthat acceleration!\"\n\nShinny grinned and cut the rockets. The jet-boat catapult deck was\nquiet, and Connel turned back to the communicator.\n\n\"Come in, Manning--Astro! This is Major Connel. Come in!\"\n\nOn the opposite side of the airless satellite, Roger and Astro were busy\ndigging a hole in the hard surface. Near by lay the last of the\nexplosive units to be installed. Connel's voice thundered through their\nheadset phones.\n\n\"Boy, is he blasting his jets!\" commented Roger.\n\n\"Yeah,\" grunted Astro. \"He should have to dig this blasted hole!\"\n\n\"Well, this is where it's got to go. If the ground is hard, then it's\nour tough luck,\" said Roger. \"If we stick it anywhere else, it might\nmess up the whole operation.\"\n\nAstro nodded and continued to dig. He held a small spade and jabbed at\nthe ground. \"How much--time--have we got left?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Twenty minutes,\" replied Roger. \"You'd better hurry.\"\n\n\"Finished now,\" said Astro. \"Get the reactor unit over here and set the\nfuse.\"\n\nRoger picked up the heavy lead box and placed it gently inside the hole.\n\n\"Remember,\" Astro cautioned, \"set the fuse for two hours.\"\n\n\"No, you're wrong,\" replied Roger. \"I've set the fuses each time,\nsubtracting the amount of time since we left the _Polaris_. I set this\none for twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"You're wrong, Roger,\" said Astro. \"It's maximum time is two hours.\"\n\n\"Listen, you Venusian clunk,\" exploded Roger, \"_I_ built this thing, so\nI know what I'm doing!\"\n\n\"But, Roger--\" protested Astro.\n\n\"Twenty minutes!\" said Roger, and twisted the set-screw in the fuse.\n\"O.K., it's all set. Let's get out of here!\"\n\nThe two cadets raced back to the jet boat and blasted off immediately.\nOnce in space, Astro turned to Roger.\n\n\"Better check in with Major Connel before he tears himself to pieces!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger. \"I guess you're right.\" He flipped on the audio\ncommunicator. \"Attention! Attention! Manning to Major Connel. Am making\nflight back to _Polaris_. All installations complete.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_Remember,\" Astro cautioned, \"set the fuse for two\nhours._\"]\n\n\"What took you so long, Manning?\" barked Connel in reply. \"And why\ndidn't you answer me?\"\n\n\"Couldn't, sir,\" said Roger. \"We had a tough time digging a hole for the\nlast unit.\"\n\n\"Come back to the _Polaris_ immediately,\" said Connel. \"We're blasting\noff in fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Roger.\n\nPresently the jet boat circled the _Polaris_ and made a landing run for\nthe open port. Roger braked the small craft and brought it to rest\nalongside the others.\n\n\"That's it, spaceboy,\" he said to Astro. \"All out for the _Polaris_\nexpress back home!\"\n\n\"Just be sure you give me a good course, Manning,\" grunted Astro,\nheaving his huge frame out of the small cabin of the jet boat, \"and I'll\ngive you all the thrust you want!\"\n\nAstro secured the jet boats while Roger closed the air-lock hatch,\nshutting out the last view of the rugged little planetoid. Roger threw\nthe landscape a mocking kiss.\n\n\"So long, Junior! See you back home!\" The two cadets climbed the ladder\nleading to the control deck.\n\nSeated in front of the control panel, Tom watched the sweeping hand of\nthe solar clock. Connel paced nervously up and down behind him. Shinny\nand Alfie stood to one side also watching the great clock.\n\n\"How much time, Corbett?\" asked Connel for the dozenth time.\n\n\"Junior gets his kick in the pants in ten minutes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Connel. \"That gives me just enough time to notify Space\nAcademy to get ready to receive Junior's signal. You know what to do?\"\n\n\"I don't have to do anything, sir,\" answered Tom, nodding to the solar\nclock over his head. \"In nine minutes and twenty seconds, the reactor\nunits go off automatically at one-second intervals.\"\n\nRoger and Astro entered the control deck and came to attention. Connel\nreturned their salute and put them at ease.\n\n\"All right, our work here is done,\" said Connel. \"No point in hanging\naround any longer. Tom, you can blast off immediately.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\nConnel climbed the ladder to the radar bridge to contact Space Academy.\nAstro, Roger, Shinny, and Alfie went to their posts and began quick\npreparations for the blast-off. One by one, they checked in to Tom on\nthe control deck.\n\n\"Power deck, ready to blast off!\" reported Astro.\n\n\"Radar bridge, all set. Clear trajectory forward and up,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Energize the cooling pumps!\" bawled Tom into the intercom.\n\nThe great pumps began to wheeze under the strain of Astro's sudden\nswitch to full load without the usual slow build-up. Tom watched the\npressure needle rise slowly in front of him and finally reached out and\ngripped the master switch.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\" he yelled. \"Blast off minus\nfive--four--three--two--one--_zeroooooo!_\"\n\nHe threw the switch. The great ship shivered, vibrated, and then\nsuddenly shot away from the precious satellite. Tom quickly adjusted for\nfree fall by switching on the synthetic-gravity gyro generators and then\nannounced over the intercom,\n\n\"Major Connel! Cadet Corbett reporting. Ship space-borne at exactly\nthirty-one, sir!\"\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" replied Connel. \"Space Academy sends the crew a\n'_well done!_' Everything's set back home to take over the beam as soon\nas Junior starts on his way back. How much time until zero blast-off on\nthe satellite?\"\n\nTom glanced at the clock. \"Less than two minutes, sir!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Connel over the intercom, \"everybody to the control\ndeck if you want to see Junior do his stuff!\"\n\nIn a moment the six spacemen were gathered around the magnascope waiting\nfor the final act of their great effort. Breathlessly, their eyes\nflicking back and forth from the solar clock to the magnascope, they\nwaited for the red hand to sweep around.\n\n\"Here it comes,\" said Tom excitedly. \"One second--two\nseconds--three--four--_five!_\"\n\nOn the surface of the planetoid, giant mushrooming clouds appeared\nclimbing into the airless void. One by one the reactor units exploded.\nConnel counted them as they blew up.\n\n\"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight--\" he paused. Junior\nbegan moving away from them. \"Nine!\" shouted Connel. \"What happened to\nnine?\"\n\n\"Roger,\" shouted Astro, \"you made a mistake on the timer!\"\n\n\"But I couldn't. I--I--\"\n\nConnel spun around, his eyes blazing, breathing hard. \"What time did you\nset the last one for, Roger?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Why, twenty minutes to blast-off time, sir,\" answered the blond-headed\ncadet.\n\n\"Then it won't go off for another forty minutes,\" said Connel.\n\n\"But, sir--\" began Roger, and then fell silent. The room was quiet.\nEveryone looked at Roger and then at Connel. \"Honestly, sir, I didn't\nmean to make a mistake. I--\" pleaded Roger.\n\nConnel turned around. His face suddenly looked very tired. \"That's all\nright, Roger,\" he said quietly. \"We've all been working pretty hard. One\nlittle mistake is bound to show up in an operation like this.\" He\npaused. \"It's my fault. I should have checked those fuses myself.\"\n\n\"Does it make so much difference, sir?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"A lot of difference, Astro,\" said Connel. He sat down heavily.\n\n\"But how, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"It's very simple, Tom,\" answered Connel. His voice was strangely quiet.\n\"Junior spins on its axis in two hours, just as Earth spins in\ntwenty-four hours. I thought we had the explosions timed so at the\nproper moment we'd push Junior out of his orbit around Tara, and the\ngreater orbit around Alpha Centauri, by utilizing both speeds, plus the\ninitial thrust. But by being one blast short, forty minutes late, the\nexplosion will take place when Junior is forty minutes out of\nposition\"--he paused and calculated rapidly in his mind--\"that's about\nforty-eight thousand miles out of position. When it goes off, instead of\nsending Junior out into space, it'll blast it right into its own sun!\"\n\n\"Isn't there something we can do, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Nothing, Corbett,\" answered Connel wearily. \"Instead of supplying the\nSolar Alliance with copper, in another week Junior will be hardly more\nthan a molten piece of space junk.\" He looked at the teleceiver screen.\nAll ready, Junior was falling away.\n\n\"Stand by for full acceleration, hyperdrive,\" said the big officer in a\nhoarse whisper. \"We're heading home!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nThe subdued whine of the hyperdrive filled the power deck and made Roger\nwince as he stepped through the hatch and waved at Astro. He climbed\ndown the ladder and stopped beside the big Venusian who stood stripped\nto the waist, watching the pressure gauges on the power-deck control\nboard.\n\n\"Hiya, Roger,\" said Astro with a big grin.\n\n\"Hello, Astro,\" replied Roger and sat down on a stool near by.\n\n\"Excuse me a minute, hot-shot,\" said Astro. \"Gotta check the baffling\naround reaction tube three.\" The big cadet hurriedly donned a lead-lined\nprotective suit and entered the reaction chamber. After a moment he\nreappeared and took off the suit. He poured a glass of water, handed it\nto Roger, and poured another for himself.\n\n\"Gets pretty hot down here,\" he said. \"I don't like to use the air\nconditioner when I'm on hyperdrive. Sucks my power output and reduces\npressure on the oxygen pumps.\"\n\nRoger nodded absently at the needlessly detailed explanation. Astro\nlooked at him sharply. \"Say, what's eating you?\"\n\n\"Honestly, Astro,\" said Roger, \"I've never felt more miserable in my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Don't let it get you down, Roger,\" said Astro. \"The major said it was a\nmistake anyone could make.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" flared Roger, \"but have you seen the way he just--_talks_?\"\n\n\"Talks?\" asked Astro blankly.\n\n\"Yeah, talks,\" said Roger. \"No yelling, or blasting off, or handing out\ndemerits like they were candy. Nothing! Why he hasn't even chewed Alfie\nout since we left Junior. He just sits in his quarters.\"\n\nAstro understood now and nodded his head in agreement. \"Yeah, you're\nright. I'd rather have him fusing his tubes than the way he is now.\"\n\n\"Tom must feel pretty rotten, too,\" said Roger. \"I haven't seen much of\nhim either.\"\n\n\"Or Alfie,\" put in Astro. \"Neither of them have done anything but work.\nI don't think either of them has slept since we left Tara.\"\n\n\"It's all my fault!\" said Roger. \"I'm nothing but a loudmouthed bag of\nspace gas--with an asteroid for a head!\" He got up and lurched toward the\nladder.\n\n\"Hey, where you going?\" yelled Astro.\n\n\"Almost forgot,\" yelled Roger from the top of the ladder. \"I've got to\nfeed our prisoners a meal. And the way I feel, I'd like to shove it down\ntheir throats!\"\n\nRoger went directly to the galley off the control deck and prepared a\nhasty meal for Loring and Mason. He piled it on a tray and went below to\nthe brig.\n\n\"All right, Loring,\" he growled, \"come and get it!\"\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" sneered Loring. \"Where's the big Manning spirit? You\nboys are kinda down since you blew that little operation, huh?\"\n\n\"Listen, you space crawler,\" said Manning coldly, \"one more word out of\nyou and I'll bring you out in the passageway and pound that head of\nyours into space junk!\"\n\n\"I wish you'd try that, you little squirt!\" snarled Loring. \"I'd break\nyou in two!\"\n\n\"O.K., pal,\" said Roger, \"I'm going to give you that chance!\" He opened\nthe door to the cell and Loring stepped out. Holding the paralo-ray gun\non him, Roger relocked the door. Left inside, Mason stuck his face close\nto the grille.\n\n\"Give it to him, Loring,\" he hissed. \"Take him apart!\"\n\nRoger threw the paralo-ray gun in the corner of the passageway and faced\nthe heavier spaceman. He held his arms loosely at his side, and he\nbalanced on the balls of his feet. A slight smile played at the corners\nof his mouth.\n\n\"Start breaking, Loring,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Why, you--\" snarled Loring and rushed in. He swung wildly for Roger's\nhead, but the cadet slipped inside the punch and drove a hard right to\nLoring's mid-section. The prisoner doubled over, staggered back, and\nslowly straightened up. Roger's lips were drawn tightly in a grimace of\ncold anger. His eyes were shining hard and bright. He stepped in quickly\nand chopped two straight lefts to Loring's jaw, then doubled the\nspaceman up again with a hard right to the heart. Loring gasped and\ntried to clinch. But Roger threw a straight jolting right to his jaw.\nThe prisoner slumped to the floor, out cold. The fight was finished.\n\nRoger went over, picked up the paralo-ray gun, and opened the cell door\nagain.\n\n\"All right, Mason,\" he said coldly, \"drag him inside. And if you want to\ntry me for size, just say so.\"\n\nMason didn't answer. He merely hurried out, and grabbing Loring by the\nfeet, dragged him inside. Roger slammed the door and locked it.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nRubbing his knuckles and feeling better than he had felt for days, he\nstarted back to the radar bridge. As he neared Major Connel's quarters,\nhe heard Connel's voice. He stopped and listened outside the door.\n\n\"It's a beautiful job of calculation, Tom,\" Connel was saying. \"I don't\nsee how you and Higgins could have done it in so short a time. And\nwithout an electronic computer to aid you. Beautiful job--really\nexcellent--but I'm afraid it's too risky.\"\n\n\"I've already talked to Astro and Mr. Shinny, sir,\" said Tom, \"and\nthey've volunteered. I haven't spoken to Roger yet, but I'm sure he'd\nbe willing to try.\"\n\nRoger stepped through the door.\n\n\"Whatever it is,\" said Roger, \"I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Eavesdropping on your commanding officer,\" said Connel, eying the\nblond-headed cadet speculatively, \"is a very serious offense.\"\n\n\"I just happened to hear my name mentioned, sir,\" replied Roger with a\nsmile.\n\nConnel turned back to Tom. \"Go over that again, Tom.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Tom, \"Junior's falling into the sun at a speed of\ntwenty-two miles a second right now. But we could still land a jet boat\non Junior, set up more nuclear explosions to blast him out of the sun's\ngrip, and send him on his way to our solar system. We wouldn't get as\nmuch speed as before, but we'd still save the copper.\"\n\nBy this time, Astro and Shinny had joined the group and were standing\noutside the door in the passageway, listening silently.\n\nConnel tugged at his chin. \"Let's see,\" he said, \"if we could get back\nto Tara in three days ...\" He looked up at Astro. \"Do you think you\ncould get us back in three days, Astro?\"\n\n\"Major Connel, for another crack at Junior,\" roared the big Venusian,\n\"I'd get you back in a day and a half!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Connel. \"That's one problem. But there are others.\"\n\n\"What, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We have to prepare reactant fuses and we have to build new reactor\nunits. If we could do that--\"\n\n\"If Astro can get us back,\" said Shinny, \"and Roger and this smart young\nfeller here, Alfie, can make up some fuses, I'll build them there\nunits. After all, Astro showed me how once. I guess I can follow his\norders!\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Connel. \"Now there is the element of time. How much time\nwould we need on Junior?\" He looked at Tom.\n\n\"Let me answer this way, sir,\" said Tom. \"We'd only have two hours to\nplant the reaction charges and trigger them, but that should be enough.\"\n\n\"Why so close, Tom?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"It has to be,\" answered Tom. \"We know what the pull of the sun is, and\nthe power of the jet boat. When the sun's pull becomes greater than the\nescape speed of the jet boat, the boat would never clear. It would keep\nfalling into the sun. I've based this figure on reaching Junior at the\nlast possible moment.\"\n\n\"It'd take at least five men to set up the five explosions we need,\"\nmused Connel. \"That means one of us will have to stay on the _Polaris_.\"\n\nThere was an immediate and loud chorus of \"Not me!\" from everyone.\n\n\"All right,\" said Connel, \"we'll draw numbers. One, two, three, four,\nfive, and six. The man who draws number six will stay with the\n_Polaris_. All right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, glancing around. \"We agree to that.\"\n\nConnel went to his desk and wrote quickly on six slips of paper. He\nfolded each one, dumped them in his cap, and offered it to Astro.\n\n\"All right, Astro,\" said Connel, \"draw!\"\n\nAstro licked his lips and stuck in his big paw. The Venusian fingered\nseveral, then pulled out a slip of paper. He opened it and read aloud.\n\"Number two! I go!\" He turned and grinned at the others.\n\nConnel offered his cap to Alfie. Alfie dipped in two fingers and pulled\nout a slip. \"Number four! I go!\" he squealed.\n\nRoger and Shinny drew numbers one and three. Tom looked at the major.\n\"Go ahead, Corbett,\" said Connel.\n\n\"After you, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I said draw one!\" roared Connel.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. He reached in and quickly pulled out one of the\ntwo remaining slips.\n\n\"Number six,\" he said quietly. \"I stay.\"\n\nConnel, not bothering to open the last one, slapped the hat on his head\nand turned away.\n\n\"But, sir,\" said Tom, \"I--ah--\"\n\nConnel cut him off with a wave of his hands. \"No _buts_!\" He turned to\nthe others. \"Manning, Higgins! Get me a course back to Junior and make\nit clean and straight. Astro, Shinny, stand by on the power deck for\ncourse change. Tom, get on the control deck. We're going back to snatch\na hot copper filling right out of a sun's teeth!\"\n\n\nOnce again the energy of the six spacemen was burned in twenty-four hour\nstretches of improvisation and detailed calculations. Roger and Alfie\nredesigned the fuse to ensure perfect co-ordination of the explosions.\nAstro and Shinny surpassed their previous efforts by putting enough\npower in the five small reaction units to more than do the job required.\nTom, standing long watches on the control deck, devoted his spare time\nto the torturous equations that would mean failure or success to the\nwhole project. And Major Connel, alert and alive once more, drove his\ncrew toward greater goals than it had achieved before.\n\nNearly three days later, the _Polaris_ appeared over the twin oceans of\nTara and glided into an orbit just beyond the pull of the planet's\ngravity. Aboard the spaceship, last-minute preparations were made by the\nred-eyed spacemen.\n\nIn constant contact with Space Academy, using the resources of the\nAcademy's scientific staff to check the more difficult calculations, the\nsix men on the _Polaris_ worked on.\n\nConnel appeared on the radar bridge and flipped on the long-range\nscanner.\n\n\"Have to find out where Junior is,\" he said to Roger and Alfie.\n\n\"That doesn't work, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"What do you mean it doesn't work?\" exploded Connel.\n\n\"Junior's falling into the sun, sir. The radiations are blocking it out\nfrom our present position.\"\n\n\"Couldn't we move to another position?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger, \"we could. But to do that would take extra time,\nand we haven't got it.\"\n\n\"Then how are you going to find Junior?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Alfie's busy with a special scanner, sir, one that's especially\nsensitive to copper. Since the sun is composed mostly of gas, with this\nfilter only Junior will show up on the screen.\"\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" exclaimed Connel, \"you mean to tell me that\nAlfie Higgins is building a new radar scanner, just like that?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, sir,\" answered Roger innocently. \"Is there something wrong\nwith that?\"\n\n\"No--no--\" said Connel, backing off the bridge. \"Just--just go right on.\nYou're doing fine! Yessirree, fine!\" He literally ran from the bridge.\n\n\"Most humorous of you, Manning,\" said Alfie, smiling.\n\n\"I'll tell you something funnier than that,\" said Roger. \"I feel the\nsame way he does. Is there anything you _can't_ do, Alfie?\"\n\nAlfie thought a moment. \"Yes, there is,\" he said at last.\n\n\"What?\" demanded Roger.\n\n\"I can't--shall I say?--make as much progress as you do with--er--space\ndolls.\"\n\nRoger's jaw dropped. \"Space dolls! You mean--girls?\"\n\nAlfie nodded his head.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Roger, \"when we get Junior on his way home, and we get\nback to the Academy, I promise you I'll show you how to really blast\nyour jets with the space lovelies in Atom City!\"\n\nAlfie put out his hand seriously. \"And if you do that for me, Roger,\nI'll show you how to use the new electronic brain they recently acquired\nat the Academy. Only one other person can operate it. But you definitely\nhave the potential.\"\n\nRoger stared at him stupidly. \"Huh? Yeah. Oh, sure!\"\n\nGradually the mass of data was brought together and co-ordinated, and\nfinally, as Tom stood beside him, Major Connel checked over his\ncalculations.\n\n\"I can't see a thing wrong with it, Tom,\" Connel said at last. \"I guess\nthat's it. Figuring we land on Junior at exactly seventeen hundred\nhours, we'd reach the point of no return exactly two hours later.\"\n\n\"Shall I alert stations to blast off for Junior?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Connel, \"bring the _Polaris_ to dead ship in space about\nthree hundred miles above Junior. That's when we'll blast off in jet\nboats.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. His eyes bright, he turned to the intercom. \"All\nright, you space babies,\" he announced, \"this is it. Stand by to blast\nJunior. Here we come!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nDawn broke over the tangled jungles of Tara, followed by the bright sun\nof Alpha Centauri rising out of the eastern sea and slowly climbing\nhigher and higher. In the dense unexplored wilderness, living things,\nterrible things, opened their eyes and resumed their never-ending quest\nfor food. Once again Alpha Centauri had summoned one hemisphere of its\nsatellite planet to life.\n\nMeanwhile, high in the heavens above Tara, six Earthmen blasted into the\nflaming brilliance of the sun star. Using delicate instruments instead\nof claws, and their intelligence instead of blind hunger, they prepared\nto do battle with the sun star and force it to release the precious\ncopper satellite from its deadly, consuming grasp.\n\nThe crew of the _Polaris_ assembled on the control deck of the great\nspaceship, and facing their commanding officer, waited patiently for the\nword that would send them hurtling out to their target.\n\n\"The jet boats are all ready, sir,\" reported Tom. \"We're dead ship in\norbit around Junior at an altitude of about three hundred miles.\"\n\n\"Does that mean we're falling into the sun too?\" gasped Shinny.\n\n\"It sure does, Mr. Shinny,\" said Alfie, \"at more than twenty miles per\nsecond.\"\n\n\"The jet boats have enough power to get back from Junior to the\n_Polaris_, Mr. Shinny,\" reassured Tom. \"And then the _Polaris_ can blast\noff from here. The jet boats wouldn't go much higher off Junior this\nclose to the sun.\"\n\n\"But if we go beyond the two-hour limit, the _Polaris_ can't blast off\neither,\" commented Roger dryly.\n\n\"All right. Is everything set?\" asked Connel. \"Astro, is the reactant\nloaded?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Astro, \"but it's all ready to go in.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Connel. \"Now we all know how important--and how\ndangerous--this operation is. I don't have to tell you again. You stay\nhere on the control deck, Tom, and keep in touch with us on Junior at\nall times. You know what to do?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom. \"I'm to stand by and give you a\nminute-by-minute warning check until final blast-off time.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Connel. \"And remember, we're counting on you to tell us\nwhen to blast off. We'll be too busy down there to pay any attention.\"\n\n\"I understand, sir,\" replied Tom. His face was passive. He was well\naware of the responsibility.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Connel finally, \"the rest of you board your jet boats!\nThis is going to be the hottest ride we'll ever take, and I don't want\nit to get any hotter!\"\n\nSilently, their faces grim masks, the five spacemen filed out of the\ncontrol room, leaving Tom alone. Presently he heard the cough of the\nrockets in the jet boats as one by one the small space craft blasted out\nof the _Polaris_. Suddenly Tom began to shake as he realized the\nimportance of his task--the responsibility of counting time for five\nmen, time that could cost them their lives. If he made a single mistake,\nmiscounted by a minute, the expedition to Junior would end not only in\nfailure, but in tragedy.\n\nAs quickly as the thought came, Tom pushed it aside and turned to the\ncontrol board. No time now for fear. Now, more than any other time in\nhis life, he had to keep himself alert and ready for every emergency. As\na child he had often dreamed of the day when, as a spaceman, he would be\nfaced with an emergency only he could handle. And in the dreams he had\ncome through with flying colors. But now that it was a reality, Tom felt\nnothing but cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.\n\nHe turned his whole attention to the great solar clock overhead. Time\nhad already begun slipping away. Ten minutes of the two hours had swept\npast. They must be on Junior by now, he thought, and flipped on the\nteleceiver. He focused on the satellite's surface. There in front of him\nwere the three jet boats. Major Connel, Roger, Astro, Alfie, and Mr.\nShinny were so close that Tom felt as though he could touch them. They\nwere unloading the first reactor unit, with Astro and Shinny digging the\nhole. Tom glanced at the clock, turned to the microphone, and announced\nclearly:\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour and forty-eight\nminutes until blast-off time--one hour and forty-eight minutes to\nblast-off.\"\n\nHe flipped the switch and watched the screen with rising excitement. The\ncrew on the satellite had completed the installation of the first\nreactor unit. He saw them blasting off in their jet boats for the second\nspot. He adjusted the teleceiver and tried to follow them, but they\ndisappeared. He glanced at the clock.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour and forty-seven\nminutes to blast-off--one hour and forty-seven minutes to blast-off.\"\n\nOn the satellite, in the deep shadow of a protecting cliff, each of the\nfive Earthmen paused involuntarily when they heard Tom's warning.\n\n\"Forget about the time!\" snapped Connel. \"By the blessed rings of\nSaturn, we'll finish this job if it's the last thing we do!\"\n\nConnel went to each of the working figures and adjusted the valve,\nregulating the air-cooling humidity control on their space suits.\n\"Getting pretty hot, eh, boys?\" he joked, as he stopped one and then the\nother to make the delicate adjustment counteracting the heat that was\nincreasing each second they remained on the satellite.\n\n\"How hot do you think it is, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Never mind the heat,\" said Connel. \"These suits were designed to\nwithstand the temperature of the light side of Mercury! It gets boiling\nthere, so I guess we can stand it here for a while.\"\n\nOne by one, Alfie, Shinny, Roger, and Astro completed their assigned\nroles, digging the holes, placing the reactors inside, setting the fuse,\ncovering it up, then quickly gathering the equipment, piling back into\nthe three jet boats, and heading for the next point. Landing, they would\ntumble out of the small space craft almost before the rocket had stopped\nfiring and begin their frantic digging in the hard surface.\n\n[Illustration: _Landing, they would tumble out of the jet boat and begin\ntheir frantic digging_]\n\nOver and over, they heard Tom's crisp clear count of time. Five minutes\npassed, then ten, and before they knew it, a full half-hour of the\nprecious time had vanished. They completed the installation of the\nsecond unit and climbed back into the jet boats. The first two units\nhad been buried at points protected from the sun by cliffs, and they had\nbeen sheltered from the burning rays.\n\nBut, approaching the position for the third reactor unit, Connel\nsearched in vain for some shade. He wasted five precious minutes,\nscouting an area of several miles, but he could find nothing to protect\nthem on the flat plain.\n\n\"Better put in the ultraviolet glass shields in our helmets, boys,\" he\ncalled into the jet-boat communicator. \"It's going to be mighty hot, and\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" came the replies from the other two jet boats soaring\nclose by.\n\nRoger began refitting their space helmets with the dark glass that would\nshield them from the strong rays of the enlarging sun.\n\n\"Ever been outside in the direct path of the sun with no protection,\nRoger?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"No,\" replied Roger. \"Have you?\"\n\n\"Once,\" said Astro softly. \"On the second moon of Mars, Phobos. I was\nbucking rockets on the old chemical burners. I was on a freighter called\nthe _Happy Spaceman_. A tube blew on us. Luckily we were close enough to\nPhobos to make a touchdown, or the leak would have reached the main fuel\ntanks and blown us clean out to another galaxy.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"I had to go outside,\" said Astro. \"I was junior rocketman in the crew,\nso naturally I had to do all the dirty work.\"\n\nTom's warning call from the _Polaris_ control deck, tuned to the open\ncommunicators of all the jet boats, broke through the loud-speaker.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour and twenty minutes to\nblast-off time. One hour and twenty minutes to blast-off time.\"\n\nThe two cadets looked at each other as they heard Tom's voice, but\nneither spoke. Finally Roger asked, \"What happened on Phobos?\"\n\n\"No one bothered to tell me,\" continued Astro, \"that I had to protect\nmyself from the ultraviolet rays of the sun, since Phobos didn't have an\natmosphere. It was one of my first hops into space and I didn't know too\nmuch. I went outside and began working on the tube. I did the job all\nright, but for three weeks after, my face was swollen and I couldn't\nopen my eyes. I almost went blind.\"\n\nRoger grunted and continued to line the clear plastic fish-bowl helmets\nwith the darker protective shields.\n\nConnel's voice rang through the cabin over the communicator: \"I guess\nwe'd better go down and get it over with. I don't see anything that will\ngive us any protection down there. Be sure your humidity control is\nturned up all the way. As soon as you step outside the jet boat, you're\ngoing to be hit by a temperature of four hundred degrees!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" came Shinny's reply over the intercom. Roger flipped\nthe communicator on and acknowledged the order.\n\nAstro and Shinny followed Connel's jet boat in a long sweeping dive to\nthe surface of the satellite. Stepping out of the air-cooled jet boat\nonto the torrid unprotected surface of the flat plain was like stepping\ninto a furnace. Even with space suits as protection, the five Earthmen\nwere forced to work in relays in the digging of the hole for the reactor\nunit.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour exactly to blast-off\ntime! One hour--sixty minutes--to blast-off time.\"\n\nTom flicked the teleceiver microphone off, and on the teleceiver screen,\nwatched his spacemates work under the broiling sun. They were ahead of\ntime. One hour to complete two more units. Tom allowed himself a sigh of\nhope and relief. They could still snatch the copper satellite from the\npowerful pull of the sun.\n\nSuddenly Tom heard a sound behind him and whirled around. His eyes\nbulged in horror.\n\n\"Loring!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Take your hand off that microphone, Corbett,\" snarled Loring, \"or I'll\nfreeze you!\"\n\n\"How--how did you get out?\" Tom stammered.\n\n\"Your buddy, Manning,\" sneered Loring with a short laugh, \"decided he\nwanted to paste my ears back. So I let him. He was so anxious to make me\nlose a few teeth that he didn't notice the spoon I kept!\"\n\n\"Spoon?\" asked Tom incredulously.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Mason, stepping through the door, a paralo-ray gun leveled\nat Tom. \"A few teeth for a spoon. A good trade. We waited for your pals\nto leave the ship, and then I short-circuited the electronic lock on the\nbrig.\"\n\nTom stared at the two men unbelievingly.\n\n\"All right, Corbett, get over there to that control board,\" growled\nLoring, waving the paralo-ray gun at Tom. \"We're going back to Tara.\"\n\n\"Tara?\" exclaimed Tom. \"But Major Connel and the\nothers--they're--they're down on the satellite. If I don't pick them up,\nthey'll fall into the sun!\"\n\n\"Well, ain't that too bad,\" sneered Loring. \"Listen to that, Mason. If\nwe don't hang around and pick them up, they'll fall into the sun!\"\n\nMason laughed harshly and advanced toward Tom. \"I only got one regret,\nCorbett. That I can't stay around to see Connel and the Manning punk\nfry! Now get this wagon outta here, and get it out quick!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\n\"Major!\" shouted Astro. \"Look! The _Polaris_! The _Polaris_ is blasting\noff!\"\n\nThe five Earthmen stared up at the silvery spaceship that was rapidly\ndisappearing into the clear blue void of space. Without hesitation,\nConnel raced for the nearest jet boat and roared into the communicator.\n\n\"Corbett! Corbett! Come in, Tom!\"\n\nHe waited, the silence of the loud-speaker more menacing than anything\nthe spaceman had ever encountered before. Again and again, the Solar\nGuard officer tried to raise the cadet on the _Polaris_. Finally he\nturned back to the four crewmen who hovered around the jet boat, hoping\nagainst hope.\n\n\"Whatever it is,\" he said, \"I'm sure Tom is doing the right thing. We\ncame down here to do a job and we're going to do it! Get moving! We\nstill have to set up the rest of these reactor units.\"\n\nWithout a word, the five men returned to their small ships and followed\ntheir commanding officer.\n\nThe sun grew larger and the heat more intense with each minute, since\neach minute brought them almost thirteen hundred miles closer to the\nsun's blazing surface. With the humidity-control and air-cooling\nmechanisms in the space suits working at top capacity but affording\nlittle relief, Alfie, Roger, Shinny, and Astro buried the fourth reactor\nunit and headed for the fifth and last emplacement. Occasionally one of\nthem would turn and cast a swift glance at the clear blue space\noverhead, secretly hoping to find the rocket cruiser had returned. Or,\nthey would strain their ears for Tom's voice counting off the minutes so\ncarefully for them. But they saw nothing and they heard nothing. They\nconcentrated on their jobs, working like demons to complete the\ninstallations as planned. They could not stop now and wonder what had\nhappened to the _Polaris_, or even hope for its speedy return. They had\na job to do, and they went about it silently, efficiently, and surely.\n\nAstro stood up, the small spade in his hand hanging loosely at his side.\nHe watched Roger and Alfie bring the last of the reactor units from\nMajor Connel's jet boat. They gently lowered it into the hole and\nstepped back while Shinny, under the watchful eyes of Major Connel, set\nthe fuse. Shinny stepped back, and Astro began covering up the lead box.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Connel. \"We're finished!\"\n\nWhat Connel meant was that they were finished with the placement of the\nreactor units, but he knew immediately that his words had been taken to\nmean something each felt but had not dared to put into words.\n\nConnel started to correct this misunderstanding but caught himself in\ntime. It would not do, he thought, for him to make excuses for what they\nknew to be the truth.\n\n\"All right, everyone in my jet boat,\" he snapped. \"Astro, you and Roger\ntake all the fuel out of the other boats and pour it into mine. It'll be\na tight squeeze, but we can all fit into one craft. No use expending\nfuel wastefully.\"\n\nAstro and Roger bent to the task of draining the fuel from their jet\nboats and loading it into Connel's.\n\nAlfie came over to join them, while Shinny and Connel scanned the sky\noverhead for some sign of the _Polaris_.\n\n\"This is really a desperate situation to be in, isn't it, Roger?\" asked\nAlfie.\n\n\"Offhand, I'd say yes,\" drawled Roger, \"but since we've got two big\nhuskies like Astro and Major Connel along, I don't think we'll have much\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Alfie.\n\n\"We'll just let them get out and help push!\"\n\n\"And if that doesn't work,\" snorted Astro, \"we'll stick Manning outside\nand let him talk about himself. That oughta give us enough gas to get us\naway from this hunk of copper.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said Alfie emphatically, \"that you're joshing me, Manning.\"\n\n\"Now, whatever gave you that idea?\" asked Roger in a hurt tone.\n\n\"This _is_ a serious situation, isn't it?\" asked Alfie, looking at\nAstro.\n\n\"It sure is, Alfie,\" said Astro soberly, \"and I'm the first one to say\nI'm a little scared!\"\n\nAlfie smiled. \"I'm very glad you said that, Astro,\" he said, \"because I\nfeel exactly the same way!\" He turned and walked back to Major Connel.\n\n\"What was the idea of telling him that?\" hissed Roger at Astro. \"What\nare you trying to do? Get the little guy space happy, or something?\"\n\n\"Look at him!\" said Astro. \"I'm twice his size. He figures if a big guy\nlike me is scared, then he's got a right to be scared too!\"\n\nRoger grunted in appreciation of the way Astro had treated Alfie's\nfears and turned back to the loading of the fuel.\n\nMajor Connel walked over and watched them transfer the last of the fuel\ninto the tanks.\n\n\"How much have you got there, Astro?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'd say enough to sustain flight for about three hours, sir.\nConsidering we'll have such a big load.\"\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" mused Connel. \"You know we're up against big odds, don't you?\"\n\nRoger and Astro nodded.\n\n\"If Tom doesn't come back soon, we'll be so far into the pull of the\nsun, even a ship the size of the _Polaris_ wouldn't be able to break\nout.\"\n\n\"How much time have we got, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Not too much, Manning,\" said Connel. \"Of course we can blast off in the\njet boat and get up a few hundred miles, in case Tom does come back.\nThen he won't have to bring the _Polaris_ down here. But if time runs\nout on us up there, we'll have to come back and take our chance on\nJunior being blasted out of the sun's grip.\"\n\nThere was a pause while Astro and Roger considered this.\n\n\"That would mean,\" asked Roger, \"that we'd be here when the reactor\nunits go off, wouldn't it, sir?\"\n\n\"That's right, Manning,\" said Connel, admitting to the danger. \"Even if\nJunior were blasted out of the pull of the sun, we couldn't survive the\nexplosions.\"\n\n\"Couldn't we blast off in the jet boat and then land after the\nexplosions, sir?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Connel, \"we could do that. But the radioactivity would\nbe so powerful we couldn't last more than a few days. We have no\nantiradiation gear. Not even food or water.\" He paused and scanned the\nsky. \"No,\" he said in a surprisingly casual voice, \"the only way we can\nget out of this is for Tom to come back and get us.\"\n\nShinny and Alfie came over and joined the group around the jet boat. No\none said anything. There wasn't anything to say. Each of them felt the\nheat burning through his space suit. Each felt the same fear tugging at\nhis throat. There was nothing to say. The _Polaris_ was not to be seen;\nthe sky was empty of everything except Alpha Centauri, the great burning\nmass of gases that once they had all seen only as a quiet twinkling star\nin the heavens, never dreaming that someday it would be pulling them\nrelentlessly into its molten self.\n\n\nTom Corbett had a plan.\n\nHe sat at the control board of the great rocket cruiser, apparently\nwatching the needles and gauges on the panel, but his mind was racing\ndesperately. The two-hour deadline had just passed. The great solar\nclock had swung its red hand past the last second. Only a miracle could\nsave the five men on Junior now. But Tom was not counting on miracles.\nHe was counting on his plan.\n\n\"Keep this space wagon driving, Corbett!\" ordered Loring from behind\nhim. \"Keep them rockets wide open!\"\n\n\"Listen, Loring,\" pleaded Tom. \"How about giving those fellows a break?\nIf I don't pick them up, they'll all be killed.\"\n\n\"Ain't that too bad,\" snarled Mason.\n\n\"Look,\" said Tom desperately, \"I'll promise you nothing will happen to\nyou. We'll let you go free. We'll--\"\n\nLoring cut him off. \"Shut your trap and concentrate on them controls!\nYou and Major Connel and them other punks are the only guys between me\nstaying free or going back to a prison asteroid. So you don't think I'm\ngoing to let them stay alive, do you?\" He grinned crookedly.\n\n\"You dirty space crawler!\" growled Tom and suddenly leaped up from the\ncontrol seat.\n\nLoring raised the paralo-ray gun threateningly. \"One more move outta you\nand I'll freeze you so solid you'll think you're a chunk of ice!\" he\nyelled.\n\nMason stepped to the other side of the control deck. They had Tom\nblocked on either side.\n\n\"Now get back to them controls, Corbett,\" snarled Loring, \"or I'll give\nit to you right now.\"\n\n\"O.K., Loring, you win,\" said Tom. He sat down and faced the control\npanel. He tried hard not to smile. They had fallen for it. Now they were\nseparated. Mason remained on the opposite side of the room. Tom took a\ndeep breath, crossed his fingers, and put the next step of his plan into\naction. He reached out and pulled the master acceleration switch all the\nway back. The _Polaris_ jumped ahead as if shot out of a cannon.\n\n\"Hey,\" growled Mason, \"what're you doing?\"\n\n\"You want more speed, don't you?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Mason, \"but don't try any funny stuff!\"\n\n\"I don't see how I can. You've got me nailed with that paralo-ray,\" Tom\nreplied.\n\nHe got up leisurely, so as not to excite the nervous trigger finger of\nLoring, and turned slowly.\n\n\"What is it this time?\" demanded Loring.\n\n\"I just gave you an extra burst of speed. All the _Polaris_ will take.\nNow I've got to adjust the mixture of the fuel, otherwise she'll kick\nout on you and we'll have to clean out the tubes.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" sneered Loring. \"Well, I happen to know you do that right on the\ncontrol board.\" He motioned with the paralo-ray gun. \"Get back down!\"\n\n\"On regular space drive, you do,\" agreed Tom. \"But we're on hyperdrive\nnow. It has to be done there\"--he pointed to a cluster of valves and\nwheels at one side of the control deck--\"one of those valve wheels.\"\n\n\"Stay where you are,\" said Mason. \"I'll do it!\" He moved to the corner.\n\"Which one is it?\" he asked.\n\nTom gulped and struggled hard to keep the terrible nervousness out of\nhis voice. He had to sound as casual as possible. \"The red one. Turn it\nto the right, hard!\" he said.\n\nLoring sat down and Mason bent over the valve wheel. He gave the wheel a\nvicious twist. Suddenly there was the sound of a motor slowing down\nsomewhere inside the great ship. Tom gripped the edge of the control\nboard and waited. Slowly at first, but surely, Tom felt himself\nbeginning to float off his chair.\n\n\"Hey!\" yelled Mason. \"I'm--I'm floating!\"\n\n\"It's the gravity generators,\" yelled Loring. \"Corbett's pulled a fast\none. We're in free fall!\"\n\nTom lifted his feet and pushed as hard as he could against the control\npanel. He shot out of the chair and across the control room just as\nLoring fired his ray gun. There was a loud hiss as the gun was fired,\nand then the thud of a body against the wall, as Loring was suddenly\nshoved by the recoil of the charge.\n\nTom huddled in the upper corner of the control deck like a spider, his\nlegs drawn up underneath him waiting for Mason to fire. But the smaller\nspaceman was tumbling head over heels in the center of the room. The\nmore he exerted himself, the more helpless he became. His arms and legs\nsplayed out in an effort to level himself, as he kept trying to fire the\nray gun.\n\nTom saw his chance and lunged through the air again, straight at the\nfloating spaceman. He passed him in mid-air. Mason made an attempt to\ngrab him, but Tom wrenched his body to one side and pulled the ray gun\nout of the other's hand.\n\nHe flipped over and turned his attention to Loring who was more\ndangerous, since he was now backed up against a bulkhead waiting for Tom\nto present a steady target. Loring started to fire, but Tom saw him in\ntime and shot away from the wall toward the hatch. He twisted his body\ncompletely around, and with his shoulder hunched over, fired at Loring\nwith his ray gun. The charge hit the target and Loring became rigid, his\nbody slowly floating above the deck. His back to the wall, braced for\nthe recoil, Tom brought his arm around slowly and aimed at Mason. He\nfired, and the spaceman stiffened.\n\nTom smiled. Neither of the spacemen would give him any more trouble now.\nHe pushed slightly to the left and shot over to the valve that Mason had\nunwittingly turned off. Tom turned it on and clung to an overhead pipe\nuntil he felt the reassuring grip of the synthetic gravity pull him to\nthe deck. Loring and Mason, in the same positions they had been in when\nTom fired, settled slowly to the deck. Tom walked over and looked at\nboth of them. He knew they could hear him.\n\n\"For smart spacemen like you two,\" said Tom, \"you sure forgot your basic\nphysics. Newton's laws of motion, remember? Everything in motion tends\nto keep going at the same speed, unless influenced by an outside force.\nFiring the ray gun was the outside force that will land you right on a\nprison asteroid! And you'd better start praying that I can pull those\nfellows off that satellite, because if I don't, you'll wind up frying in\nthe sun with us!\"\n\nHe started to drag them to a locker and release them from the effects of\nthe ray blast, but, remembering their cold-blooded condemnation of\nConnel and the others to death on the satellite, he decided to let them\nremain where they were.\n\nHe turned to the control board and flipped on the microphone. He was too\nfar away to pick up an image on the teleceiver, but the others could\nhear him on the audio, if, thought Tom, they were still alive.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! _Polaris_ to Major Connel! Major Connel, can you\nhear me? Come in, Major Connel--Astro--Roger--somebody--come in!\"\n\nHe turned away from the mike and fired the starboard jets full blast,\nmaking a sweeping curve in space and heading the _Polaris_ back to\nJunior.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\n\"There's only one answer, boys,\" said Connel. \"Loring and Mason have\nescaped and taken over the ship. I can't think of any other reason Tom\nwould abandon us like this.\"\n\nThe jet boat was crowded. Alfie, the smallest, was sitting on Astro's\nlap. For more than an hour they had circled above the copper satellite,\nsearching the surrounding skies in vain for some sign of the _Polaris_.\n\n\"Major,\" said Roger, who was hunched over the steering wheel of the\nsmall space craft, \"we're almost out of fuel. We'd better drop down on\nthe night side of Junior, the side away from the sun. At least there\nwe'd be out of the direct heat.\"\n\n\"Very well, Roger,\" said Connel. \"In fact, we could keep shifting into\nthe night side every hour.\" Then he added quietly, thoughtfully, \"But\nwe're out of fuel, you said?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger. \"There's just enough to get down.\" Roger sent\nthe craft in a shallow dive. Suddenly the rockets cut out. The last of\nthe fuel was gone. Roger glided the jet boat to a smooth stop on the\nnight side of the planetoid.\n\n\"How much longer before the reactor units go up?\" asked Shinny.\n\nConnel turned, thinking he had heard something on the communicators,\nthen answered Shinny's question. \"Only four hours,\" he said.\n\nThe crew of spacemen climbed out of the jet boat into the still\nblackness of the night side of the planet. There wasn't anything left to\ndo.\n\nThey sat around on the hard surface of the planet, staring at the\nstrange stars overhead.\n\n\"You know,\" said Astro, \"I might be able to set up something to convert\nsome of the U235 in the reactors to fuel the jet boat.\"\n\n\"Impossible, Astro,\" said Alfie. \"You'd need a reduction gear. And not\nonly that, but you haven't any tools to handle the mass. If you opened\none of those boxes, you'd be fried immediately by the radiation!\"\n\n\"Alfie's right,\" said Connel. \"There's nothing to do but wait.\"\n\nMajor Connel turned his face up as far as he could in the huge fish-bowl\nhelmet to stare at the sky. His eyes wandered from star cluster to star\ncluster, from glowing Regulus, to bright and powerful Sirius. He stifled\na sigh. How much he had wanted to see more--and more--and more of the\ngreat wide, high, and deep! He remembered his early days as a youth on\nhis first trip to Luna City; his first sensation at touching an alien\nworld; his skipper, old, wise, and patient, who had given him his creed\nas a spaceman: \"Travel wide, deep, and high,\" the skipper had said to\nthe young Connel, \"but never so far, so wide, or so deep as to forget\nthat you're an Earthman, or how to act like an Earthman!\" Even now,\nyears later, the gruff voice rang in his ears. It wasn't long after that\nthat he had met Shinny. Connel smiled behind the protection of his\nhelmet, as he looked at the wizened spaceman, who was now old and\ntoothless, but who still had the same merry twinkle in his eye that\nConnel had noticed the first time he saw him. Connel had signed on as\nfirst officer on a deep spacer bound for Titan. Shinny had come aboard\nand reported to Connel as rocketman. Shinny had promptly started roaring\nthrough the passageways of the huge freighter in his nightshirt singing\nsnatches of old songs at the top of his voice. It had taken Connel four\nhours to find where Shinny had hidden the bottle of rocket juice! Connel\nlaughed. He looked over at the old man fondly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Say, Nick,\" said Connel, addressing the man by his given name for the\nfirst time, \"you remember the time it took me four hours to find that\nbottle of rocket juice you hid on that old Titan freighter?\"\n\nShinny cackled, his thin voice coming over the headphones of the others\nas well as Connel's.\n\n\"I sure do, Lou!\" replied Shinny, using Connel's first name. They were\njust old spacemen now, reliving old times together. \"Funny thing,\nthough, you never knew I had two more bottles hidden in the tube\nchamber!\"\n\n\"Why, you old space crawler!\" roared Connel. \"You put one over on me!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nRoger and Astro and Alfie had never known Connel's first name. They\nrolled the name over in their minds, fitting the name to the man.\nUnknown to each other, they decided that the name fitted the man. Lou\nConnel!\n\n\"Say, Lou,\" asked Shinny, \"where in the blessed universe did you come\nfrom? You never told me.\"\n\nThere was a long pause. \"A place called Telfair Estates, in the deep\nSouth on the North American continent. I was raised on a farm close by.\nI used to go fishing late at night and stare up at the stars.\" He paused\nagain. \"I ran away from home. I don't know if--if--anyone's still there\nor not. I never went back!\"\n\nThere was a long silence as each man saw a small boy fishing late at\nnight, barefoot, his toes dangling in the water, a worm wiggling on the\nend of a string, more interested in the stars that twinkled overhead\nthan in any fish that might swim past and seize the hook.\n\n\"Where are you from, Nick?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Born in space,\" cackled Shinny, \"on a passenger freighter carrying\ncolonists out to Titan. Never had a breath of natural fresh air until I\nwas almost a grown man. Nothing but synthetic stuff under the atmosphere\nscreens. My father was a mining engineer. I was the only kid. One night\na screen busted and nearly everybody suffocated or froze to death. My pa\nand ma was among 'em. I blasted off after that. Been in the deep ever\nsince. And you know, by the blessed rings of Saturn, I'd be on a nice\nfarm near Venusport, living on a pension, if you hadn't kicked me out of\nthe Solar Guard!\"\n\n\"Why, you broken down old piece of space junk,\" roared Connel, \"I\noughta--\" Connel never finished what he was going to say.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Roger--Astro--Major Connel--come in, please! This\nis Tom on the _Polaris_!\"\n\nAs if they had been struck by a bolt of lightning, the five spacemen sat\nup and then raced to the jet boat.\n\n\"Connel to Corbett!\" roared the major. \"Where are you? What happened?\"\n\n\"I haven't got time to explain now, sir,\" said Tom. \"Loring and Mason\nescaped and forced me to take them to Tara. I managed to overcome them\nand blast back here. Meet me up about fifty miles above Junior, sir. I'm\nbringing the _Polaris_ in!\"\n\n\"No!\" yelled Connel. \"It's no use, Tom. We're out of fuel. We've used up\nall our power.\"\n\n\"Then stand by,\" said Tom grimly. \"I'm coming in for a landing!\"\n\n\"No, Tom!\" roared Connel. \"There's nothing you can do. We're too far\ninto the sun's pull. You'll never blast off again!\"\n\n\"I don't care if we all wind up as cinders,\" said Tom, \"I'm coming in!\"\n\nThe communicator went dead and from the left, over the close horizon of\nthe small satellite, the _Polaris_ swept into view like a red-tailed\nfire dragon. It shot up in a pretouchdown maneuver, and then began to\ndrop slowly to the surface of the planetoid.\n\nNo sooner had the _Polaris_ touched the dry airless ground than the\nair-lock hatch was opened. From the crystal port on the control deck,\nTom waved to the men below him.\n\nShinny climbed into the lock first, followed by Astro, Alfie, Roger, and\nConnel. While Roger and Alfie closed the hatch, Astro and Connel\nadjusted the oxygen pressure and waited for the supply to build to\nnormal. At last the hissing stopped, and the hatch to the inner part of\nthe ship opened. Tom greeted them with a smile and an outstretched hand.\n\n\"Glad to have you aboard!\" he joked.\n\nAfter the back slapping between Roger, Astro, and Tom was over, Connel\nquestioned Tom on his strange departure from the satellite.\n\n\"It was just like I told you, sir,\" explained Tom. \"They got out of the\nbrig,\" he paused, not mentioning the spoon that Loring had used or how\nhe had gotten it. \"They forced me to take them to Tara. I managed to get\nthe gravity turned off and gave them a lesson in free-fall fighting.\nThey're still frozen stiff up on the control deck.\"\n\n\"Good boy!\" said Connel. \"I'll go and have a talk with them. Meantime,\nAstro, you and Shinny and Alfie get below and see how much fuel we have\nin emergency supply. We're going to need every ounce we have.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Astro. The three hurried to the power deck.\n\nConnel followed Roger and Tom to the control deck. Loring and Mason were\nstill in the positions they were in when Tom had fired his paralo-ray.\nConnel took Tom's gun and switched to the neutralizer. He fired twice\nand the two men rose shakily to their feet. Connel faced them, his eyes\nburning.\n\n\"I'm going to say very little to you two space-crawling rats!\" snapped\nConnel. \"I'm not going to lock you in the brig; I'm not going to confine\nyou in any manner. But if you make one false move, I'll court-martial\nyou right here and now! You've caused enough trouble with your\nselfishness, jeopardizing the lives of six men. If we fail to get off\nthis satellite, it'll be because _you_ put us in this position. Now get\nbelow and see what aid you can give Astro. And if either of you so much\nas raises your voice, I'm going to let _him_ take care of you! Is that\nclear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" mumbled Loring. \"We understand, sir. And we'll do everything\nwe can to--to--make up for what we've done.\"\n\n\"The only thing you can do is to stay out of my sight!\" said Connel\ncoldly.\n\nLoring and Mason scuttled past Connel and climbed down to the power\ndeck.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Control deck--Major Connel! Sir, this is Roger on\nthe radar bridge. I just checked over Tom's figures on thrust, sir, and\nI'm not sure, but I think we've passed the point of safety.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Roger,\" said Connel. He turned to the intercom. \"Power deck,\ncheck in!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Loring and Mason there?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I'm putting them right to work in the radiation chamber, sir.\nI'm piling all emergency fuel into the reaction chambers to try for one\nbig push!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"I heard what Roger said, sir,\" replied Astro. \"This'll give us enough\nthrust to clear the sun's gravity, but there's something else that might\nnot take it.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"The cooling pumps, sir,\" said Astro. \"They may not be able to handle a\nload as hot as this. We might blow up.\"\n\nConnel considered this a moment. \"Do what you can, Astro. I have\nabsolute faith in you.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Astro. \"And thank you. If this wagon holds\ntogether, I'll get her off.\"\n\nConnel turned to Tom who stood ready at the control panel.\n\n\"All set, sir,\" said Tom. \"Roger's given me a clear trajectory forward\nand up. All we need is Astro's push!\"\n\n\"Unless Astro can build enough pressure in those cooling pumps to handle\nthe overload of reactant fuel, we're done for. We'll get off this moon\nin pieces!\"\n\n\"Power deck to control deck.\"\n\n\"Come in, Astro,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Almost ready, Tom,\" said Astro. \"Maximum pressure is eight hundred and\nwe're up to seven seventy now.\"\n\n\"Very well, Astro,\" replied Connel. \"Let her build all the way to an\neven eight hundred and blast at my command.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Astro.\n\nThe mighty pumps on the power deck began their piercing shriek. Higher\nand higher they built up the pressure, until the ship began to rock\nunder the strain.\n\n\"Stand by, Tom,\" ordered Connel, \"and if you've ever twisted those\ndials, twist them now!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Pressure up to seven ninety-one, sir,\" reported Astro.\n\n\"Attention! All members strap into acceleration cushions!\"\n\nOne by one, Shinny and Alfie, Loring and Mason, Astro and Roger strapped\nthemselves into the acceleration cushions. Roger set the radar scanner\nand strapped himself in on the radar bridge. Connel slumped into the\nsecond pilot's chair and took over the controls of the ship, strapping\nhimself in, while Tom beside him did the same. The whine of the pumps\nwas now a shrill whistle that drowned out all other sounds, and the\ngreat ship bucked under the force of the thrust building in her heart.\n\nIn front of the power-deck control panel Astro watched the pressure\ngauge mount steadily.\n\n\"Pressure up to seven ninety-six, sir,\" he called.\n\n\"Stand by to fire all rockets!\" roared Connel.\n\n\"Make it good, you Venusian clunk,\" yelled Roger.\n\n\"Seven ninety-nine, sir!\" bellowed Astro.\n\nAstro watched the gauge of the pressure creep slowly toward the\neight-hundred mark. In all his experience he had never seen it above\nseven hundred. Shinny, too, his merry eyes shining bright, watched the\nneedle jerk back and forth and finally reach the eight-hundred mark.\n\n\"Eight hundred, sir,\" bellowed Astro.\n\n\"Fire all stern rockets!\" roared Connel.\n\nAstro threw the switch. On the control board, Connel saw a red light\nflash on. He jammed the master switch down hard.\n\nIt was the last thing he remembered.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\nTom stirred. He rolled his head from side to side. His mouth was dry and\nthere was a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He opened his eyes\nand stared at the control panel in front of him. Instinctively he began\nto check the dials and gauges. He settled on one and waited for his\npounding heart to return to normal. His eyes cleared, and the gauge swam\ninto view. He read the figures aloud:\n\n\"Distance in miles since departure--fourteen thousand, five hundred ...\"\n\nSomething clicked. He let out a yell.\n\n\"We made it! We made it!\" He turned and began to pound Connel on the\nback. \"Major Connel! Major, wake up, sir! We made it. We're in free\nfall! Junior's far behind us!\"\n\n\"Uh--ah--what--Tom? What?\" Connel said, rolling his eyes. In all his\nexperience he had never felt such acceleration. He glanced at the gauge.\n\n\"Distance,\" he read, \"fifteen thousand miles.\" The gauge ticked on.\n\n\"We made it, sir!\" said Tom. \"Astro gave us a kick in the pants we'll\nnever forget!\"\n\nConnel grinned at Tom's excitement. There was reason to be excited. They\nwere free. He turned to the intercom, but before he could speak, Astro's\nvoice roared into his ears.\n\n\"Report from the power deck, sir,\" said Astro. \"Acceleration normal.\nRequest permission to open up on hyperdrive.\"\n\n\"Permission granted!\" said Connel.\n\n\"Look, sir,\" said Tom, \"on the teleceiver screen. Junior is getting his\nbumps!\"\n\nConnel glanced up at the screen. One by one the white puffs of dust from\nthe reactor units were exploding on the surface of the planetoid. Soon\nthe whole satellite was covered with the radioactive cloud.\n\n\"I'm sure glad we're not on that baby now,\" whispered Tom.\n\n\"Same here, spaceman!\" said Connel.\n\n\nIt was evening of the first full day after leaving Junior before the\nroutine of the long haul back to Space Academy had begun. The _Polaris_\nwas on automatic control, and everyone was assembled in the messroom.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" said Connel, \"our mission is a complete success. I've\nfinished making out a report to Space Academy, and everything's fine.\nIncidentally, Manning,\" he continued, \"if you're worried about having\nbroken your word when you escaped from the space station, forget it. You\nmore than made up for it by your work in helping us get Loring and\nMason.\"\n\nRoger smiled gratefully and gulped, \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nLoring and Mason, who had eaten their meal separately from the others,\nlistened silently. Loring got up and faced them. The room became silent.\n\nLoring flushed.\n\n[Illustration: _\"I know we're going to be sent to the prison asteroid\nand we deserve it,\" said Loring._]\n\n\"I'd like to say something,\" he began haltingly, \"if I can?\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Connel.\n\n\"Well,\" said Loring, \"it's hard to say this, but Mason and myself,\nwell--\" He paused. \"I don't know what happened to us on the first trip\nout here, Major, but when we saw that satellite, and the copper,\nsomething just went wrong inside. One thing led to another, and before\nwe knew it, we were in so deep we couldn't get out.\"\n\nThe faces around the table were stony, expressionless.\n\n\"Nobody deserves less consideration than me and Mason. And--well, you\nknow yourself, sir, that we were pretty good spacemen at one time. You\npicked us for the first trip out to Tara with you.\"\n\nConnel nodded.\n\n\"And well, sir, the main thing is about Jardine and Bangs. I know we're\ngoing to be sent to the prison asteroid and we deserve it. But we been\nthinking, sir, about Jardine's and Bang's wives and kids. They musta\nlost everything in that crash of the _Annie Jones_, so if the major\nwould recommend that Mason and me be sent to the Titan mines, instead of\nthe rock, we could send our credits back to help take care of the kids\nand all.\"\n\nNo one spoke.\n\n\"That's all,\" said Loring. He and Mason left the room.\n\nConnel glanced around the table. \"Well?\" he asked. \"This is your first\nstruggle with justice. Each of you, Tom, Roger, Astro, Alfie, will be\nfaced with this sort of thing during your careers as spacemen. What\nwould you do?\"\n\nThe four cadets looked at each other, each wondering what the other\nwould say. Finally Connel turned to Alfie.\n\n\"You're first, Alfie,\" said Connel.\n\n\"I'd send them to the mines, sir,\" said Alfie.\n\nConnel's face was impressive. \"Roger?\"\n\n\"Same here, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Astro?\" asked Connel.\n\n\"I'd do anything to help the kids, sir,\" said Astro, an orphan himself.\n\n\"Tom?\"\n\nTom hesitated. \"They deserve the rock, sir. I don't have any feeling for\nthem. But if they go to the rock, that doesn't do any more than punish\nthem. If they go to the mines, they'll be punished and help someone else\ntoo. I'd send them to Titan and exile them from Earth forever.\"\n\nConnel studied the cadets a moment. He turned to Shinny.\n\n\"Think they made a good decision, Nick?\"\n\n\"I like what young Tommy, here, had to say, Lou,\" answered Shinny. \"Best\npart about justice is when the man himself suffers from his own guilty\nfeelings, rather than what you do to him as punishment. I think they did\nall right!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Connel. \"I'll make the recommendation as you have\nsuggested.\" Suddenly he turned to Shinny. \"What about you in all this,\nNick? I don't mean that you were hooked up with Loring and Mason. I know\nyou were just prospecting and you've proved yourself to be a true\nspaceman. But what will happen to you now?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what's going to happen to me,\" snapped Shinny. \"You're\ngoing to re-enlist me in the Solar Guard, right here! Right now!\"\n\n\"What?\" exploded Connel.\n\n\"And then you're going to retire me, right here, right now, with a full\npension!\"\n\n\"Why you old space-crawling--\" Suddenly he looked around the table and\nsaw the laughing faces of Tom, Roger, Astro, and Alfie.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"but between your enlistment and your retirement,\nI'm going to make you polish every bit of brass on this space wagon,\nfrom the radar mast to the exhaust tubes!\"\n\nShinny smiled his toothless smile and looked at Tom.\n\n\"Get the logbook, Tommy,\" he said. \"This is official. I'm going to do\nsomething no other man in the entire history of the Solar Guard ever did\nbefore!\"\n\n\"What's that, Mr. Shinny?\" asked Tom with a smile.\n\n\"Enlist, serve time, and retire with a full pension, all on the same\nblasted spaceship, the _Polaris_!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Transcriber's Note                                           |\n|                                                              |\n| Typographical errors corrected:                              |\n|                                                              |\n| 1) familarity changed to familiarity                         |\n| 2) but's changed to buts                                     |\n| 3) word changed to work                                      |\n|                                                              |\n| Possible typographical error left as is:                     |\n|                                                              |\n|    All ready possibly should read Already                    |\n|                                                              |\n| Standardized hyphenation:                                    |\n|                                                              |\n| 1) paralo ray changed to paralo-ray                          |\n| 2) upperclassmen changed to upper-classmen                   |\n|                                                              |\n| In addition, the nickname Blast-off occurs in two forms      |\n| throughout the text: \"Blast-off\" and 'Blast-off'.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
