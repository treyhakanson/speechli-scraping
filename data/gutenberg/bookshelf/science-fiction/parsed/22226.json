The red glow of the furnaces bathed\nthe tall buildings, the gigantic scaffolds, the cord-like\nelevated pipelines and the columnar smokestacks in the crimson of\nanger. Even the moon seemed to fade as the long-fingered\nsmokestacks reached toward it belching their pollution. The air,\nwhich should have been clean, was filled with the reek of\nunfamiliar odors.\n\nFrom the machine shop, where giant cannon were forged into\nsmooth, sleek instruments of death, came noise: unchecked,\nunmuffled, blasphemous din. But something odd was afoot. There\nwas a sudden hush. It seemed as if a giant hand had covered the\nmetal city to muffle its screams.\n\nIn the nearby city of box-like houses, where the workers lived,\nthere was an echoing stir. Lights glowed in the windows of the\ntiny homes. People were awakened in the night by the sudden\ncessation of din.\n\nSomething was wrong in the factory.\n\nBut there couldn't be anything wrong. The factory was enclosed by\na high, electrified fence. There were guards on duty night and\nday, armed to the teeth and ready to shoot an intruder who failed\nto give an account of himself. There were wars and rumors of wars\non the face of the earth and there was need for the uninterrupted\nproduction of sleek cannon.\n\nBut, if something were wrong, why didn't the whistle blow? There\nwere signals: three short blasts, repeated many times, meant\nfire; one long blast meant a breakdown; five toots meant a\nlayoff. But now the whistle was silent.\n\nHeads popped from the windows of the houses in the city. They\nlistened. Was it a whistle that the workers heard? No. It was a\nwhispering, barely audible at first, then louder. It was the\nwhisper of tongues of flame. But no flames were visible. Only the\nred glow of the furnaces lighted up the factory's profile.\n\nOne by one the lights of the city went out as workers went back\nto bed, to toss restlessly. Without noise there could be no\nsleep.\n\nThe tongues of flame still whispered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA car moved rapidly through the streets of the city. At the wheel\nwas a man dressed in a captain's uniform. The machine whirled\nonto the highway that led toward the factory. A barricade,\nlighted by torch-lanterns, barred his path. A sentry with a\nbayoneted gun stood to one side, signaling a halt.\n\nThe car slowed.\n\n\"Captain Ted Taylor, ordnance department!\" the captain said,\nextending his pass toward the sentry.\n\nThe sentry signaled him on.\n\nThe car came within a stone's throw of the factory, where it\nturned into a parking lot. The officer climbed out, noiselessly,\nand moved into the shadows.\n\nOnce Captain Taylor had been a scientist, but that was long ago,\nbefore wars had made biology very unexciting.\n\nOut of the shadows a second figure moved. He was a short, stocky\nman, compared with the slender, graceful figure of the captain.\n\n\"Ps-st! Captain!\"\n\n\"Masters!\"\n\n\"You got my short-wave call, I see. I was afraid you would be\nasleep. He came late, but he's in the tunnel now.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"The fellow we've suspected all along. Poses as an ignorant\nlaborer, but he's not ignorant by a long shot. His name is Hank\nNorden.\"\n\nMasters pointed toward a clump of bushes. As he did, he caught\nthe captain's arm with his left hand. The bushes were moving.\n\nA black hole appeared at the base of the bushes and from it\nemerged the head and shoulders of a man. Taylor drew his pistol.\nThe man's head turned, searching the shadows to see if he was\nobserved. He failed to detect the figures of Taylor and Masters,\nhuddled nearby in the shadows.\n\nThe man scrambled from the hole. He closed the trap door behind\nhim and then started to move rapidly away.\n\n\"Halt!\" barked Taylor.\n\nThe man began to run. The captain's pistol spat, kicking up dust\nbeside the running feet. The fleeing man jumped to one side, to\nspoil Taylor's aim on the next shot, but as he did so, he\nstumbled and fell.\n\nA moment later Taylor had landed on top of him, pinning him to\nthe ground.\n\nThe faded moonlight showed angry eyes, a jutting, undershot jaw\nand a sharp, pointed nose.\n\n\"Damn you!\" spat the captive.\n\nTaylor removed a revolver from the prisoner's clothing and tossed\nit to Masters.\n\n\"It's Norden, all right,\" Masters said, scrutinizing the captive.\n\"I'd know that jaw in a million. What are you doing here,\nfellah?\"\n\n\"I'm blowing the factory to hell!\" Norden said between his teeth.\n\"You can't stop me. Everything's fixed. In a minute a bomb'll go\noff. You, I, everyone will be smashed to atoms. And I'm glad. For\nthe fatherland.\"\n\n\"We know why you're doing it,\" Taylor said. \"Come on, Masters.\nGet your short-wave working. Notify the factory office. Where's\nthe bomb, Norden? Come on, speak up, or I'll pull you to pieces!\"\n\nNorden said nothing. Masters was calling the office. He turned to\nthe captain:\n\n\"I can't raise anyone.\"\n\n\"We'll go to the gate.\" Taylor prodded the prisoner ahead on the\nrun.\n\n\"You can't make it in time,\" Norden panted.\n\n\"We'll die trying!\"\n\nA floodlight turned the area in front of the gate into a patch of\ndaylight. An armed sentry challenged from a small building. The\ncaptain answered.\n\n\"Sorry, but you can't come in. Strict Orders. After hours,\" the\nsentry said, when the captain asked to be allowed to pass.\n\n\"But it's urgent--life or death. We've got to use your telephone.\nOr--you call the office. Tell the super there's a bomb in the\nplant--\"\n\nThe sentry's jaws gaped, but only for an instant. Down the road\ninside the plant came a running, bareheaded figure--screaming:\n\n\"Let me out! Let me out of here!\"\n\n\"Halt!\" shouted the sentry.\n\nThe figure stumbled to a stop at the gate. The light showed the\npale, sweating face trembling with fear.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" the sentry asked.\n\n\"The metal pots! They're alive! Big, orange bubbles are floating\nfrom the cauldrons!\"\n\n\"Nuts!\" said the sentry. \"You're drunk.\"\n\nBut as the soldier spoke there was a trembling movement of the\nground beneath the feet of the men at the gate. Captain Taylor\nthrew himself on the ground. But there was no blast.\n\nThe red of the sky-glow suddenly faded to orange. Up through the\nroof of the casting room crashed a huge, glowing sphere then\nfloated like a will-o'-the wisp in the moonlight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE SPHERES\n\n\nWhen the sentry faced the captain again, he stared into the mouth\nof a service pistol.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said the officer, \"but I've got to get inside.\" Captain\nTaylor turned to Masters. \"Keep him covered. I'll be back unless\nthe bomb goes off.\"\n\n\"The bomb,\" whispered Norden, fearfully, \"should have exploded. I\nwas double-crossed. They sent me here to get caught! The dirty--\"\n\n\"Watch Norden, and you might keep your eye on Funky, here,\"\nTaylor said, pointing to the slobbering man who had dropped to\nhis knees at the sight of the orange sphere. \"I'm going inside.\"\n\nThe captain moved through the gate. The silence was uncanny.\nSince the war began this factory had never been idle. Thousands\nof cannon made; contracts for countless more! But now quiet, save\nfor an undescribable, whispering overtone that seemed to permeate\nthe air.\n\nSomething glowed in the semi-darkness ahead like a pile of hot\nashes on the ground.\n\nTaylor entered the long forge room. A white hot splinter of metal\nhung from the crane. There were a dozen heaps of the glowing\nashes scattered about the room, but no sign of life.\n\nHe moved on into the finishing room, where the long tubes of\nhowitzers and field pieces lay in various stages of construction.\nStill there was silence.\n\nThe whispering grew louder, like a breeze stirring dry cornstalks.\n\nThe silence suddenly was broken by a scream. Then another. There\nwas a sound of running footsteps.\n\nTaylor dropped behind a lathe.\n\nThrough the door came an orange glow. Sharply outlined against\nthe eerie light ran a human figure, a man in overalls, carrying a\nhammer. On the fellow's face was frozen fear. He halted, turned\nand looked behind him.\n\nThe darkness vanished as through the doorway floated a huge,\norange sphere of light.\n\n\"Stop! Go back! I mean you no harm!\" screamed the workman.\n\nThe ball of orange fire floated on toward him. The man's arm\nraised. He hurled the hammer straight at the sphere.\n\nThe missile rang, bounced back and fell to the sandy floor.\n\nA small flicker of flame wafted over the surface of the sphere.\nThen it lashed out like a whip toward the trembling man. His\nentire body glowed like a torch, then crumpled to the floor in a\nheap of ashes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScarcely daring to breathe, the captain watched the sphere float\nover the ashes of its victim for a moment; then, apparently\nsatisfied that the man no longer lived, floated back through the\ndoorway.\n\nTaylor took a deep breath. It might be well if the bomb would\nexplode, but he knew now it had been silenced.\n\nIn an insulated panel on the wall were the remains of an electric\nswitchboard. The copper switches were fused, the wires burned\nthrough. The huge cables that brought the electric current to the\nswitchboard lay molten on the floor.\n\nThe bomb probably was electrical and undoubtedly had been fused\nlike the switchboard.\n\nThe captain had one objective now, to get out of the plant before\nthe orange spheres discovered him. He didn't know what he faced,\nbut something told him that it had never faced mankind before. He\nhad no weapon to combat the sphere.\n\nTaylor reached the forge room again. He stepped over more\nglowing piles of ashes.\n\nThen his ears caught a crescendo of the whispering that he had\nheard before. He looked behind him. In the doorway was an orange\nglow. The sphere was coming--looking for him!\n\nBehind the forge was a machine which had been used to operate the\ncrane. Beyond it was stygian darkness. He might hide there.\n\nThe captain slipped toward the machine. Every bit of electrical\nwiring on the controls had been fused.\n\nThe room grew lighter, the whispering louder and then, through\nthe doorway, floated the dazzling sphere.\n\nSomething gripped Taylor's shoulder muscles. A mild electrical\nshock coursed through his body, as if an invisible feeler had\npassed over him.\n\nThe sphere halted, changed its direction and floated slowly\ntoward the captain.\n\nInstinctively, Taylor backed into the corner behind the machine.\nHe dropped to his hands and knees and was free of the invisible\nfeeler! Again the orange sphere halted, as if trying to relocate\nits victim.\n\nTaylor rounded a pillar which supported the track for the crane.\nHis fingers struck an accumulation of rubbish that had been\ntossed into the corner. He started to push it out of the way,\nwhen the floor beneath it moved. It was a trap door!\n\nA gasp of surprise came from Taylor's lips. He had a chance. But\nthe sound gave him away. The electrical feeler touched him again.\nThe shock jerked at his muscles and the sphere started floating\nnearer.\n\nThe trap door swung back. Taylor's right boot touched the top\nrung of the ladder. He moved his left boot down to the next rung.\nEach movement seemed to take ages and every exertion of his\nmuscles was agony as the electrical shock gripped him with\nincreasing intensity.\n\nHe forced his body down into the opening. He saw the flame\nflickering over the surface of the sphere as the thing prepared\nto strike.\n\nThe sphere seemed to pulse briefly as he released his grasp on\nthe rim of the opening and shoved himself downward into the hole.\nHe dropped several feet.\n\nAbove him a brilliant flash of fire lit the opening.\n\nThe sphere itself hovered above the hole.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES\n\n\nThe sphere pulsed again. But this time no flaming whip sprang\nfrom its surface. There was a single flash. For an instant Taylor\ncaught a glimpse of bestial eyes, looking angrily at him from the\ncenter of the flash. Then there was nothing. He was in the\ndarkness of a tunnel. Even the charred embers of the wooden trap\ndoor above him seemed dimmed by a cloud of dust.\n\nThe sphere had simply exploded.\n\nTaylor had no time to analyze the situation. His hands groped\nalong the side of the tunnel, the one Norden had used to enter\nthe plant on his spying expeditions. Taylor crawled slowly,\nfeeling his way. It seemed eternity until at last he reached the\nend of the passage and felt the trap door overhead.\n\nA minute later he rejoined the others, huddled in darkness\noutside the gate.\n\n\"The searchlight went out,\" Masters explained. \"Something wrong\nwith the power, I guess.\"\n\n\"I know what it was,\" Taylor said gruffly. He turned to the\ndisarmed sentry. \"Has anyone come out of here since the factory\nstopped working?\"\n\n\"Nobody but him, sir,\" the soldier said, jerking his thumb at the\nsobbing man huddled against Norden. \"He said his name was\nOrkins--Jim Orkins. He works in the warehouse. But you can't tell\nanything about the rest o' what he says. He just babbles, sir.\nSomething about livin' lightnin' and balls of fire. He ain't\ndrunk, sir, so he must be crazy.\"\n\n\"Help him get up,\" Taylor ordered. \"Masters, you take charge of\nNorden. We're going back to the car.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" the sentry said, hesitantly. \"But that's\nagainst orders. I can't leave. I'm to guard this gate, sir.\"\n\n\"Your orders are canceled,\" the captain said.\n\n\"If I desert my post, it's court martial,\" the sentry explained.\n\"How do I know you aren't a spy? Captains don't go around making\nprivates break the orders of the day. If you've got business in\nthe plant, why was I told to keep _everyone_ out? Why didn't they\ntell me to pass Captain Taylor? I got a duty here and I'll do it\nif it kills me. So help me, sir. Sergeant o' the guard!\"\n\nThe echo of the sentry's bellow rattled against the bleak factory\nbuildings. A sphere bobbed up through the hole in the roof.\nOrkins opened his mouth to scream, but Norden clapped his hand\nover the man's lips, choking him off.\n\n\"Quiet!\" Taylor ordered hoarsely. He addressed the sentry: \"See\nthat thing? It means death to you, to all of us if it finds us.\nThe sergeant of the guard, probably all of the other sentries are\ndead. Every workman in the plant is dead. Somehow we were missed.\nThe searchlight power went off before they found this post, I\nsuppose. Now then, all of you follow Masters back to the car.\nI'll bring up the rear.\"\n\n\"I won't leave,\" the sentry said, stubbornly.\n\nMasters stepped forward and put his pistol against the soldier's\nback.\n\n\"You'll go,\" he said. \"Maybe this ain't regulation, but neither\nare the spheres.\"\n\nThe stubby little secret service man pushed the soldier ahead of\nhim. The sentry marched with his hands in the air.\n\nDrawing his own pistol, Taylor turned to Norden.\n\n\"Help Orkins to the car,\" he said.\n\nNorden drew himself up stiffly.\n\n\"Go ahead and shoot,\" he said. \"It'll save the firing squad some\ntrouble.\"\n\nTaylor took one step forward. Norden faced him unflinchingly.\nTaylor's hand shot out, caught Norden's coat and threw him after\nMasters.\n\n\"Don't leave me alone!\" Orkins cried, crawling after Norden and\nclasping him about the legs. Norden kicked him aside.\n\n\"Keep moving!\" Taylor ordered Norden, who had halted.\n\nNorden did not move.\n\nTaylor swung his fist. The blow connected and the officer caught\nthe falling man, swung him over his shoulder, then turned to the\ncringing Orkins.\n\n\"If you don't want to be left here alone, follow us,\" he said.\n\nOrkins suddenly regained his ability to use his muscles.\n\nMasters, watching over his shoulder, chuckled. There was a faint\nwink of one eye visible in the moonlight.\n\n\"Kinda screwy, ain't he?\" he said, jerking his head in Orkins'\ndirection.\n\n\"I don't know that I blame him, much,\" Taylor said. \"Look at the\nplant.\"\n\nOver the roof and the smokestacks floated the yellowish-red ball\nof fire. Another sphere was emerging from the hole in the roof.\n\n\"What are they? A new kind of bomb?\" Masters asked.\n\n\"Norden's bomb never had a chance. Compared with what actually\nhappened in there, a bomb would have been a picnic. There's not a\nliving person left in the whole place.\"\n\n\"Not a--hold on there, Cap! Do you know how many were working?\"\n\n\"They're all dead,\" Taylor said. Briefly he outlined what he had\nseen in the plant.\n\n\"Norden, the blankety-blank!\" Masters swore. \"Shooting's too good\nfor him.\"\n\n\"This isn't connected with the war--at least not directly. It's\nsomething else, Masters. What, I don't know yet, but I'm\nbeginning to think that it's something the human race has never\nmet before. Those spheres have killed a couple of hundred workers\nwith bolts of energy--\"\n\n\"I'm no scientist, captain.\"\n\n\"That's the best I can describe this force, Masters. I might call\nit heat-bolts, but it's probably partly electric and partly heat,\nnot entirely either. You see, Masters, heat is energy, just like\nelectricity and light. The energy these spheres shoot out is a\nmixture of energies. We can imagine a spark of electricity\nshooting out and striking a man like a bolt of lightning, but\nit's hard to visualize heat behaving that way.\"\n\n\"Say, mister,\" the sentry interrupted, \"my arms are getting\ntired.\"\n\n\"Okay, buddy,\" Masters replied. \"If I let you put your arms down,\nwill you behave like a nice little boy?\"\n\n\"I'll be a perfect angel,\" the sentry said, lowering his arms.\n\n\"You'll be an angel if you aren't, too,\" Masters added.\n\n\"What's your name, soldier?\" Taylor asked the sentry.\n\n\"Private Pember, sir. Company A, 110th infantry--\"\n\n\"All right, Private Pember, you can carry this fellow.\"\n\nTaylor shifted the faintly stirring Norden to the shoulders of\nthe soldier.\n\n\"If it will make you feel any easier, Pember,\" the captain went\non, \"I can assure you that exigencies demanded your removal from\nyour post. Your life was in danger and you could do no good by\nremaining there. In fact, there was nothing left to guard. You\ncan do more good for your country by coming with us.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Pember said. \"I guess you are right, captain.\"\n\n\"You're a good soldier, Pember,\" Taylor went on. \"A situation\nlike this is unique. It demands use of individual initiative,\nrather than blind obedience to orders. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Pember said, adjusting the burden on his shoulder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey reached the car.\n\nA dozen of the orange-red globes now floated above the plant.\nThey were circling slowly, in widening arcs, toward the limits of\nthe factory grounds.\n\n\"Searching for human beings,\" Taylor decided, watching them.\n\nOrkins clutched Taylor's coat tails.\n\n\"They're coming out!\" he cried. \"There's hell to pay.\"\n\nTaylor took Orkins' arm and forced him down on the running board\nof the car, where Norden already was coming out of his daze.\n\n\"Keep quiet!\" Taylor ordered. \"They'll discover us.\"\n\n\"They'll find us anyway!\" Orkins said, frantic with fear. He\ngroaned loudly.\n\n\"Okay. He asked for it,\" Masters said.\n\nThere was a splatting sound as Masters' fist landed. Masters made\na face over a distasteful duty done and turned to Pember:\n\n\"Put them both in the car.\" He indicated Norden. \"Here's\nhandcuffs. Lock them together.\"\n\nTaylor and Masters watched the circling spheres. Suddenly one\ndarted down. From its pulsating body shot a flash of flame. A\nhuman scream rent the air.\n\n\"It's the darnedest thing I ever saw,\" Masters said with a\nshudder. \"Those fireballs squirt heat-electricity out at a guy\nand roast him!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Taylor said with a nod, \"and that isn't all. Those spheres\nact as though they were alive. When that one went out above the\nopening of the tunnel, I thought I saw a pair of eyes.\"\n\nMasters studied the assertion, then spoke:\n\n\"Captain, I may look dumb, but I've been in the secret service\nlong enough to be found out if I really am. I've a hunch you\nkilled that sphere.\"\n\n\"I've thought of that, but how could I? I didn't touch him.\"\n\n\"Maybe you don't have to touch 'em to kill 'em. We don't know\nwhat they are, except they're different--\"\n\n\"We don't know the real natures of anything, as far as that\ngoes. Man's a mixture of chemicals, but that doesn't explain him.\nThe spheres are a mixture of energies--we can observe that much,\nbut it still doesn't explain them. Where are they from? Why did\nthey come here? What are their primary objectives?\"\n\n\"Primary objectives? That's a military term, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Partly military, and partly scientific. We know the secondary\nobjective of the spheres. It's the same as man's or any other\nliving creature. The spheres are alive and their objective is to\nkeep on living, but that isn't their primary motif. The primary\nobjective is the difference between a good man and a bad one.\nWhatever is more important to a man than life itself is his\nprimary objective.\"\n\n\"Life's pretty important,\" Masters said, solemnly.\n\n\"Yes, but life isn't everything. Any man, no matter how yellow or\nmean he is, has some ideal he's willing to die for--or at least\nhe's willing to risk dying to attain. Look at Norden. He's hard,\ncold-blooded and he doesn't think twice about putting a bomb in a\nplant to wipe out scores of lives. He dared me to kill him,\nrather than help us. His code as a spy is his primary objective.\nLook at Pember. He must have been frightened by the spheres, but\nwe had to force him to leave his post. We've shown him that his\nduty now is with us--he realizes that the spheres are the\nimmediate enemy of his country and he'll do his best fighting\nthem. And you and I have ideals--we know each other too well to\nlist them.\"\n\n\"I getcha so far, but what about Orkins?\"\n\n\"The man's not afraid of death, but afraid of the unknown. Men\nlike him commit suicide rather than face reality. He wants\nsecurity. He's afraid of uncertainty. He lives in an unreal,\nimaginary world and when uncertainty, which is reality, intrudes,\nhe is completely lost.\"\n\n\"You make me feel sorry for the poor devil.\"\n\n\"That's because you understand why he's funky. Primary objectives\nmake men do what they do--but understanding Orkins doesn't solve\nour problem.\"\n\n\"No. What are the spheres? Are they alive? If so, they must want\nsomething. What do they want?\"\n\n\"A conquest of the human race?\" Taylor pondered. \"Maybe. But it\nisn't likely. They can't gain much by conquering us. It wouldn't\ndo man any good to stage a conquest of earthworms and swordfish,\nsince neither could pay taxes. The spheres are as different from\nman as man from an angle-worm. Are we a menace to the spheres?\nApparently the only time we really menace them is when we crawl\ninto a hole like a rabbit--maybe there's something in that that\nwill help us, but I don't think that's why they kill us. Are we a\nnuisance? If so, why? Are we a food? There is energy in sunlight\nand chemicals in the human body. A creature of energy would feed\non something like sunlight, not chemicals. His menu would be\nelectric wires, storage batteries--\"\n\n\"Great Scott, Captain!\" Masters interrupted. \"Let's get away from\nthis car. There's a battery in it--food for the spheres!\"\n\nMasters looked nervously up at the circling globes. Taylor, deep\nin thought, did not stir. Instead, he continued his speculation:\n\n\"Maybe they kill us for sport.\"\n\nHe was thinking of small boys torturing frogs; of Roman emperors\nat the circus; of sportsmen exterminating game; of the mob\nwatching the guillotine on the streets of Paris. It was\nZarathustra who said that when gazing at tragedies, bull fights\nand crucifixions, man has felt his happiest; and when man\ninvented hell, he made hell his heaven on earth. Couldn't this be\na characteristic of all life? Couldn't the spheres be cruel and\nruthless, too?\n\nMan, the mighty hunter, had become the prey.\n\nA sphere detached itself from the group and circled toward the\ncar.\n\n\"I guess you're right, Masters,\" Taylor decided as he watched the\nspheres. \"We'd better move.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPREY\n\n\nMasters unlocked the handcuffs of the two men in the car. He\ndisposed of his short-wave set in a ditch, for it, too, had\nbatteries which might attract the spheres.\n\n\"Get out of the car, Orkins,\" he ordered.\n\n\"Watch him, Masters,\" Taylor warned. \"If he starts yelling, choke\nhim.\"\n\n\"But not too hard,\" Masters added. \"If we're going to be rabbits,\nhuman values will change. Men who run into holes will live to eat\nturnips, those who bare their teeth won't. Orkins might be the\nforefather of a new race--a helluva race. Come on, Orkins. Get\nout. Hurry up, Father Abraham, or I'll drag you out.\"\n\nOrkins, cringing, emerged.\n\nTaylor took charge of Norden, who followed Orkins out of the\nmachine.\n\n\"I hate your guts, Norden,\" he said. \"You're a dirty, lousy rat\nand you ought to be shot. But after all, you're a man. You've\ncourage and I admire it, as much as I hate the way you use it.\nOverseas there's a war between countries. Here there's another\nwar between humanity and a species of alien monsters. Whether we\nlike it or not, we're allies.\"\n\nNorden's undershot jaw moved in a grin.\n\n\"I know about the spheres, Captain,\" Norden replied. \"I overheard\nyour remarks to Mr. Masters. I've listened to Orkins' babble.\"\n\n\"Will you help us?\"\n\n\"I will bargain with you.\"\n\n\"For your life? You know I can't do anything about that. I'll do\nmy best--I'll speak a good word at your trial, try to save you\nfrom the firing squad, but I'm only a captain. That's all I can\ndo. I haven't the power to do anything more.\"\n\n\"Then I will not help.\"\n\n\"Do you know what we're up against?\"\n\n\"It looks pretty bad, doesn't it, Captain? But consider my\nhopeless case.\"\n\n\"We have a chance, Norden. I know, more than any other living man\nperhaps, what those spheres are. I've seen them close at hand.\nAny hope of defeating them rests in us, using the meager\nknowledge I've gained from contact. What happens to your\nfatherland after the spheres finish on this side of the ocean\ndepends on whether we conquer them, or they exterminate us.\"\n\nNorden stopped smiling.\n\n\"When you put it that way, Captain, how could I refuse?\" he\nasked. \"I'll cooperate, not to help you, but to help the\nfatherland.\"\n\nThe moonlight showed a gleam in Norden's deep-set eyes that\nTaylor did not like.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey moved to a wooded spot in a nearby field. There was a\nfeeling of semi-security as they settled down to rest under the\ntrees. Orkins' moans of fear were silenced by sleep. Norden sat\nmotionless and Taylor could not tell whether he was asleep or\nawake. Pember removed his pack and used it for a pillow. Masters\nsnored peacefully on the grass.\n\nOnly Taylor remained awake. A sphere floated overhead. Taylor,\nwatching, saw the leaves of the tree stir restlessly as the\ninvisible feelers probed toward the earth.\n\nIt was a reddish-orange orb, like the setting sun. Taylor once\nmore got the impression of deeply embedded eyes glowering beneath\nthe shining surface.\n\nWere the eyes an illusion? Did the creatures really have eyes,\nlike those of higher forms of animal life? Illusion or not, the\neyes seemed to be there, intense, glaring and savage. They\nseemed to peer into the depths of Taylor's soul.\n\nTaylor sat motionless, almost positive he was under observation.\nHe expected to feel the jerk of the electric shock of the feeler.\nInstead, the sphere drifted on. The eyes had not seen.\n\nA moment later flame streaked down from the sphere toward the\nparking lot. There was a roar as a gasoline tank exploded and\nflame shot skyward.\n\n\"There goes the battery!\" Taylor muttered.\n\nThe others were roused by the explosion. Orkins sobbed\nhysterically. Masters, Pember and Norden watched the roaring\nflame.\n\n\"We'll never escape them!\" Orkins moaned. \"They'll find us sooner\nor later. They can sense us.\"\n\n\"They're not infallible,\" Taylor said. \"Remember I got away from\nthem in the tunnel.\" He turned knowingly toward the others.\n\"Perhaps, if we dug a cave--\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Masters. \"It's a good idea.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Pember said with a nod. He pulled his trench tool\nfrom his pack and handed it to Orkins. \"Maybe you'd like to dig,\nMr. Orkins. It'll keep your mind off them things.\"\n\nOrkins seized the small shovel almost instantly. Taylor\nhalf-smiled. He had made the suggestion for Orkins' benefit. The\ncave probably would never be finished. One deep enough to offer a\nrefuge for five men could hardly be dug in a practical length of\ntime.\n\nDawn was not far off and the spheres were drifting over the town.\nAlready streets were filled with panic-stricken people. The\nappearance of the strange balls of fire brought residents from\ntheir homes in the middle of the night. Some fled in terror,\nbelieving a new type of raider had been invented by the enemy.\nOthers stood watching.\n\nThe spheres circled. Taylor watched them, realizing he could do\nnothing to stop what would happen. There was no way to warn these\nhelpless people that the spheres dealt death in a most sudden and\nviolent form.\n\nSomething nagged at Taylor's mind. Why had the sphere gone out\nwhen he crept into the tunnel? What had caused it to die? Had the\nsphere been grounded, trying to reach him under the surface of\nthe earth? Not likely, otherwise the creatures would not be able\nto attack a man standing on the ground. The bolt, besides, was\nnot electricity, like lightning, but heat, which is not grounded\neasily.\n\nWhere had the spheres come from? They surely were not of this\nworld. On the basis of biological evolution they could not be the\nchildren of any life known to science. Had they evolved suddenly,\nby accident? Some scientists thought all life had grown by\naccident; the right combination of circumstances had occurred and\na chemical action had followed. Had the right combination for the\nspheres come about as the result of the war and the releasing of\nuntold amounts of energy?\n\nBut even if life had begun on earth by accident, all other types\nhad taken ages to develop. These spheres, thinking creatures,\ncould not have evolved overnight.\n\nThese seemingly invincible creatures could not have come from\nthis world. Biological development comes through struggle and\nsurvival. An invincible creature does not have to worry about its\nexistence--in fact, struggle was necessary to develop an\ninvincible being. These spheres must be from another world.\nRefugees, perhaps, from another, even more powerful race; or\nmaybe they were seeking a new world to conquer.\n\nOne was circling overhead again. The leaves rustled. Taylor\nthought he heard a choked-off scream. Orkins. He gritted his\nteeth grimly.\n\nThere was only one link of hope in Taylor's chain of thought.\nThere must always be a check to every form of life. Terrestrial\nplagues of insects were followed suddenly by flocks of birds. In\nwestern states an increase in the number of jackrabbits always is\na forerunner of an increase in the number of coyotes. But the\njackrabbits carried parasites fatal to the coyotes. If man was a\nrabbit, then perhaps he harbored the check to these creatures of\nflame.\n\nWhat check would limit the whispering spheres? No germ, surely.\nWhat possible check was there except man's nature? What part of\nman's nature? That was the answer Taylor wanted to know.\n\nHis chain of thought was suddenly interrupted.\n\nPember was coming on the run. The private saluted the captain.\n\n\"Something's wrong, sir! Orkins is throwing a fit.\"\n\n\"Can't you quiet him? The spheres are near.\"\n\n\"Norden held his hand over Orkins' mouth, but it made Orkins\nworse. I--I think it's serious, sir.\"\n\nTaylor followed Pember to the place where Orkins had been\ndigging. Norden was there, bending over Orkins, who lay on the\nground. Masters, standing behind Norden, shook his head.\n\n\"He's dead,\" Norden said, straightening.\n\n\"He was scared to death by the spheres,\" Masters said. \"No one\nharmed him, except to hold a hand over his mouth. He wasn't\nchoked. He could have breathed through his nostrils--\"\n\n\"Wait--\"\n\nTaylor held up his hand. Something clicked in his brain.\n\nMasters had said something about the spheres that fitted. He said,\n_Maybe you don't have to touch 'em to kill 'em._ Figuratively\nspeaking, Orkins hadn't been seriously touched either.\n\nThe answer!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAN ESCAPE\n\n\nTaylor ordered Pember and Norden to bury Orkins where he had been\ndigging, then the officer took Masters aside.\n\n\"We've got a weapon,\" Taylor announced.\n\nMasters grunted:\n\n\"Yeah? Indians had bows and arrows, too. Look at what happened to\nthem.\"\n\n\"This is different. A new weapon. We can beat the spheres through\ntheir emotions.\"\n\n\"You mean fear, love, hate--all that stuff? How do you know these\nspheres have emotions?\"\n\n\"What is life but a series of sensations and emotions? If the\nspheres are alive, they must have something which correspond to\nemotions. The emotions may be different from ours, but they'll be\nemotions just the same. Orkins died of fear. Of course, you can\ncall it heart attack, but fear brought it on. That sphere that\nhad me cornered in the plant died, too. Do you see?\"\n\n\"Was the sphere afraid of you or the tunnel?\"\n\n\"Don't be flippant. The emotion wasn't fear. It might not have\nbeen any emotion we have, but an emotion that we'd expect a\ncreature made of energy to have. An emotion of frustration! It\nhad me cornered. I escaped. The energy sphere met resistance.\nWhen energy meets resistance it changes!\"\n\n\"I don't get it.\"\n\n\"Look, Masters. If the spheres are mixtures of energies, like we\nare mixtures of chemicals, death means extinction, just as\nbiological death means the extinction of the chemical action in\nour lives. Theologians say we don't die--that there's a change\nand we go on existing in a spiritual life. Now let's take a peep\nat what science tells us about energy: Newton says energy is\nnever extinguished. When it ceases in one form, it changes to\nanother. What happens when you run electricity through a\nresistance coil?\"\n\n\"It turns to heat, of course!\"\n\n\"And when you enclose light where it can't escape?\"\n\n\"It turns to heat!\" Masters' face brightened. \"And if you pen up\nheat, it turns to light. I learned that in school. Resistance\ncauses a change. But what do the spheres turn to?\"\n\n\"Radio energy, Masters! Something absolutely harmless to man.\nThese living, energy spheres will change to radio energy when\nthey meet resistance. Frustration is resistance. Frustration is\nan emotion. An overwhelming emotion for the spheres! The sphere\nis frustrated--meets resistance--it disappears. In other words,\nit dies!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the city came screams and cries. The spheres had attacked at\nlast.\n\nThe men in the wooded field could see the darting balls sending\ntheir searing bolts down on the heads of hapless victims. The\ncrashing roar of the slaughter sounded like distant thunderstorms.\n\nStreets were jammed with panic-stricken human beings, fleeing\nfrom the unknown menace which slashed with bolts of heat energy.\n\nFrom the hole in the factory roof poured more spheres to join the\ndestruction.\n\n\"They breed fast, the devils!\" said Masters.\n\nA figure in khaki approached Taylor. It was Pember with blood\nrunning from a cut on the side of his head. He saluted briskly.\n\n\"Norden escaped, sir!\" he blurted. \"The dirty so-and-so cracked\nme over the head with the trench tool and got away!\"\n\n\"I never thought he'd turn yellow,\" Masters said. \"Well, maybe\nit's a good thing he's gone. I never trusted him anyhow.\"\n\n\"Which way did he go?\" Taylor asked.\n\n\"He went toward the factory, sir!\" Pember replied. \"He didn't\nknock me out. Just a glancing blow. I was too dazed to stop him,\nbut I saw him running toward the factory.\"\n\n\"He'd rather take it that way than the firing squad, I guess,\"\nMasters decided.\n\n\"Masters,\" Taylor said. \"We overlooked something. Norden knows\nsomething we don't know. He was around Orkins most of the time\nafter we left the plant. He listened to what Orkins said. Orkins\nwas in the factory when the spheres first appeared. I overlooked\nOrkins as having an answer to the problem. I thought I knew it\nall, but I was wrong! Orkins knew more than I know about the\nspheres.\"\n\n\"Sure! I should have thought of it, too. How did Orkins get away\nwhen everyone else got killed? I never asked that. I just took it\nfor granted that he got away by accident. Orkins might have known\nenough to help Norden get the spheres on his side!\"\n\nTaylor already was running toward the factory. At his heels came\nMasters and Pember.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nINFERNO\n\n\nThey found no sign of Norden as they approached the factory.\nSeveral times they had to take cover in ditches and weeds as\nwhispering spheres floated overhead in search of prey. But they\nescaped the electrical feelers which stirred the grass and brush\naround them.\n\nPember recovered his Garand rifle, which had been left near the\nsentry box during the retreat.\n\nTaylor led the group into the tunnel, with Masters following and\nPember bringing up the rear.\n\nThe din of the slaughter in the town and the shrill whistle of\nthe spheres was blotted out underground. They reached the far\nend, where the ladder led upward to the sphere-haunted factory.\n\nTaylor ascended. He could hear the shrill whistle of spheres\ndinning through the bleak building. He peeped into the forge\nroom. The first flush of dawn was streaming through the windows.\n\nNorden was there, creeping along the barrels of some naval guns\ntoward the casting room.\n\nNorden halted at the door. He took a deep breath. From his lips\ncame a shrill, whispering whistle, a close imitation of the call\nof the spheres.\n\nAn orange light was reflected from the room beyond.\n\nStill whistling, Norden stepped back a few paces. Through the\ndoor, floating toward the spy came an orange sphere.\n\nTaylor watched, expecting to see a bolt of heat lash out toward\nthe spy. But the sphere pulsed slowly, as if half pleased by the\nsound Norden made with his lips.\n\nSo this is how Orkins escaped from the plant, Taylor thought.\nOrkins had imitated the creatures. They had spared him as a pet,\nlike a man keeps a talking parrot.\n\nNorden stood very still, whistling while the sphere approached. A\nlittle tentacle of flame reached out toward him.\n\nTaylor expected to see Norden disappear in a flash of fire, but\nthe flame seemed to caress. A soft glow seemed to diffuse from\nthe man's clothing and body.\n\nThe sphere, too, seemed to change, growing softer and more\nmellow. It wasn't a tangible substance, but something ethereal,\nlike the flicker of flame over an open hearth. Some tremendous\nforce seemed to hold the sphere in globular shape.\n\nTaylor could see the chimerical eyes peering through the surface\nof the sphere. He looked into the depths of those eyes and still\ncould not be sure they were not an illusion. The intensity of the\ncreatures' intelligence seemed to shine from within, giving the\nimpression of staring, haunting eyes. They were not organs of\nsight, but they were the windows of the mind. They were the\nsource of those tenuous flames that seemed to caress Norden.\n\nAs Taylor looked at the eyes he felt plunged into the pathless\ndepths of a vast, powerful brain. He was in contact with an infinity\nof intelligence far beyond limits of human comprehension. It was a\nsurging intelligence of energy, abysmal, vaporous and limitless,\ntranscending the dimensions, out-reaching boundless time,\novershadowing matter.\n\nThe eyes made Taylor forget he was a man. His own mind seemed\nmerged in the intellectual energy floating among the monster\nmachines of the forge room. Dimly, he was conscious that this\npower was not directed at him, but at Norden who stood, still\nwhistling, in front of the globe.\n\nThe sphere was whistling, too, and the sound transformed itself\ninto music of the stars.\n\nA discordant note rose in the song from Norden's imitation of the\nvoice. Norden was shrieking hatred for Taylor's nation, for all\nthose who opposed the self-designated supermen of the world.\n\n\"My race must be preserved!\"\n\nThe thought was Norden's, reflected to Taylor from the shoreless\ndepths of the energy brain.\n\n\"All other peoples are evil, decadent, and are doomed to slavery\nunder the man of the future. The future man will be a child of my\nrace. My race is superior. From it the _uberman_ will rise. You\nmust help. Prey on these inferior peoples. They do not deserve to\nlive.\"\n\nThe sphere's hues changed, reddish, then yellow, back to orange.\n\n\"Is this Norden a man?\" came the sphere's questioning thought.\n\"Why doesn't he flee? Why doesn't he scream in terror? He's\ndifferent from the others. Perhaps he is, as he claims, a\nsuperior being. There was one, who called himself Orkins, who\ntalked with us. But when Orkins saw us slay he ran away in\nterror. This Norden begs us to kill.\"\n\n\"It is only through destruction of the weak that the strongest\nsurvive,\" Norden answered. \"Man is a cruel, but noble creature.\nThose who fail to kill are weak.\"\n\nThe sphere's whistle grew thunderous.\n\n\"You speak the philosophy of my world!\" it said.\n\nFrom the depths of the sphere a rhythm of thought arose. A\nwhispered epic sang through the fibres of Taylor's mind, telling\nof a world of energy, whipped into a storm of war. Spheres of\nenergy, overwhelmed a weaker race made up of gaseous clouds of\natoms.\n\nIn the midst of this titanic battle a huge disc appeared, carried\nby the gaseous clouds. It was a concave lens, like some powerful\noptical instrument. But instead of focusing beams of light, it\nreflected, not only light but all forms of energy. As the spheres\nattacked they were shattered into spores and shot away through\nspace.\n\nThe whispered song told of the flight through space. Behind lay a\nworld, unlike the earth, which the spheres called home. It was a\ngaseous, flaming world where matter and energy mingled as one\nsubstance. It was mottled with spots of cold gases which warred\nwith the whispering spheres. _It was the sun._\n\nThe sun was power, yet a ceaseless struggle between energy and\nmatter. But neither energy nor matter was in control. Should\nmatter control, the sun would cool. If energy triumphed, the sun\nwould explode. It was war, like the wars of the earth, where one\nphilosophy was based on power, and the other seeking justice. A\nvictory for might would make a ruthless world. Justice was\nworthless without injustice. The ideals were mutually dependent,\nyet always at war.\n\n\"The cold gases tricked us,\" whispered the sphere. \"The weak have\nno right to outwit the strong. The weak has no right to survive.\nJustice is an unnatural condition. Progress means nothing, except\non the road to glory. Your race, sharing our philosophy, can\nbuild another great energy reflector to send us back. We can aid\nour people in triumphing over these inferior beings who claim\nrights in a world of might.\"\n\n\"We can built what you wish,\" Norden promised.\n\nIt was a promise like other promises Norden had made, Taylor\nthought. Norden once had promised to help Taylor fight the\nspheres.\n\n\"I will call the others!\"\n\nThe sphere floated upward toward the hole in the roof. It circled\nthe factory and moved away, toward the town, where a score of\nother majestic, glowing globes floated like bubbles of fire.\n\nNorden watched, a smile cracking his jutting jaw.\n\nThere was still a whispering sound. A single shrill hiss came\nfrom the casting room.\n\n\"Why do you claim superiority, Norden?\" Taylor spoke.\n\nThe spy turned. For the first time he saw Taylor.\n\n\"_Himmel_!\"\n\nNorden's eyes looked beyond Taylor and rested on Masters, who was\nemerging from the tunnel.\n\n\"Is it because you pose the doctrine of slavery and destruction?\nIs it because your cultural contributions are keyed to military\nconquest? Is it because of your lies and broken promises? Is it\nbecause you are more skillful in butchery? It is because you have\nrefined the art of terrorism?\"\n\nTaylor was advancing, half crouching, toward Norden.\n\nNorden's arm swished in a swift motion. He drew an automatic\npistol from his pocket and leveled it at Taylor and Masters.\n\n\"Because I am the stronger!\" Norden said.\n\nTaylor had not expected Norden to be armed. He had overlooked the\npossibility that the spy might have an extra weapon hidden in the\ntunnel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nHUMANITY'S ARMY\n\n\nTaylor and Masters raised their arms. They were caught.\n\n\"There is nothing you can do now to save yourself, or your\ncountry,\" Norden said. \"Nothing. The spheres will destroy you and\nyour people. They will destroy every living creature who does not\nsurrender to my nation. Might will come into its own.\"\n\n\"Are you sure the spheres are so invincible?\" Taylor asked.\n\"Remember, they were expelled from the sun. They must have been\nchecked on the sun many times, otherwise they would have\ndestroyed the creatures who opposed them.\"\n\n\"They are greater than anything on the earth,\" Norden said.\n\n\"The spheres are not for the earth. Our battles are not theirs.\nBy betraying your world to these creatures, you are betraying the\nwhole human race.\"\n\n\"This is not so!\" Norden said, thickly. \"I know how to handle\nthem. Orkins told me. He said he imitated their whistle and they\nspared him, while they killed the others in the plant. He didn't\nrealize the value of his discovery. He was too much of a coward.\"\n\nNorden beckoned his prisoners to him and disarmed them. He\npointed to the door of the casting room.\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nIn the center of the room was a metal pot used for small\ncastings. It was filled with molten, glowing metal. Beside it sat\na single orange sphere, spraying the pot with bolts of heat to\nkeep the contents warm, for the electrical energy that had\nsupplied the melting pot had long-since been cut off.\n\nIn the center of the pot an orange-red bubble was rising from the\nmetal. A sphere was forming on the surface of the metal.\n\n\"The rise of living energy!\" Norden said. \"Our own kind of life\nmay have begun ages ago in much the same way. A spore from some\nfar off world may have drifted here through space, found\nconditions just right, and taken root. Thus the spore of the\nsun--the whispering spheres--found a set of conditions fitted for\ngrowth. That metal pot is filled with seeds of the spheres. One\nby one they will hatch and grow into a force that will bring\nextinction to all men, except those of my race. The spheres do\nnot want the world, they want the sun. We will see that they go\nback to the sun, after they have had their sport, killing the\nweaklings of your nation.\"\n\nTaylor shuddered as he looked at the growing sphere. This deep,\nintense intelligence, which found sport in killing human beings,\nalready seemed to be pouring from the depths of its half-formed\nbody.\n\n\"The fact that I am alive, proves my superiority,\" Norden said.\n\"Your people ran in terror at the sight of the spheres, but I\nbargained with them. I made an alliance.\"\n\n\"You and your superiority!\" Masters growled. \"If you really were\nsmart, you'd have counted us. Don't you know there are three of\nus who aren't afraid of the spheres?\"\n\nAs Masters spoke, the point of Pember's bayonet touched the small\nof Norden's back. The soldier had crept from the tunnel,\nunobserved by Norden, who was engrossed in the mental torture of\nhis prisoners.\n\nWith a cry of rage Norden whirled and fired.\n\nBut Taylor had expected such a move. Even as Norden swung around,\nthe officer sprang, knocking the spy off his feet and spoiling\nhis aim.\n\nA warning whistle came from the sphere heating the cauldron.\n\n\"Back! Out of the doorway!\" Taylor shouted, grappling with\nNorden. \"I'll take care of him!\"\n\nPember obeyed orders. He jumped back, dragging Masters with him.\n\nTaylor wrenched the gun from Norden's hand, just as the spy\nlanded a jarring blow to the body. Taylor staggered, lost his\nbalance and dropped the gun.\n\nNorden leaped forward to retrieve the weapon, but Taylor blocked\nthe move. He drove Norden back with a hard right. The two men\nclosed in and stood toe to toe, trading blows.\n\nThe screaming of the sphere grew louder. The creature by the\nmetal pot seemed to be calling the others over the town. The\nhalf-formed sphere in the melting pot joined and the entire\nbuilding rang with the shrill screams.\n\nTaylor was slowly driving Norden back toward the door of the\ncasting room. A tentacle of flame reached out from the monster by\nthe metal pot, but it only circled the men. Apparently it was\nafraid to strike, for fear of destroying friend as well as enemy.\n\nNorden's knee came up. Taylor dodged in time to avoid a crippling\nblow, but the leg caught him on the thigh, sending him back and\nupsetting him on the floor.\n\nWith a cry of triumph, Norden dived toward his foe. But Taylor\nrolled on his back, doubled his legs and met the hurtling body\nwith a two-footed kick.\n\nNorden grunted with pain. He staggered back, straight toward the\nsphere by the metal pot.\n\nA whistled warning had no effect. The momentum carried Norden\ncrashing into the orange nucleus of energy. There was a blinding\nflash.\n\nA small pile of glowing ashes appeared on the floor.\n\nThe whistle of the sphere stopped. It pulsed once. A feeble ray\nof heat lashed out toward Taylor, but the bolt halted in mid-air.\n\nA _plop_ cracked in Taylor's ear. The sphere disappeared like a\nbursting soap bubble.\n\n\"Cap! Are you all right!\"\n\nMasters appeared in the doorway behind Taylor.\n\n\"Gosh!\" His eyes settled on the pile of ashes, the remains of\nNorden. He turned to Taylor. \"Are you all right, Cap?\"\n\nTaylor nodded.\n\n\"Where's the sphere?\" asked Masters.\n\n\"He died of frustration--or sorrow--over having killed the wrong\nman,\" Taylor said grimly. Taylor indicated the half-formed\nmonster in the pot. \"Now we've got to get rid of that one and all\nthe unhatched spores.\"\n\n\"If that metal pot hatches 'em, we will,\" said Masters. \"We'll\ndump the metal.\"\n\nThe undeveloped sphere made no move to launch a deadly bolt\ntoward the men. Apparently at this stage of incubation the\nspheres were harmless.\n\n\"Pember!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" the soldier appeared in the doorway, carrying his\nbayonetted gun.\n\n\"Keep a lookout for other spheres. Masters and I are going to\ndump this metal pot.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nAn electric motor ordinarily dumped the pot into molds, but this\nmotor, like everything else electrical in the plant, now was out\nof commission. Masters, however, found a block and tackle and\nrigged it to a beam above the pot. The hook he attached to the\nbottom of the pot.\n\n\"Grab hold, Cap!\" he said, taking the end of the rope.\n\nTaylor loosened his tunic and seized the rope.\n\n\"Heave!\" Masters chanted.\n\nThe two men strained. Slowly the pot tilted.\n\nPember, standing at a window, called out over his shoulder:\n\n\"They're coming back!\"\n\nAbove the creak of the pulleys rose the murmuring whisper of the\nspheres.\n\n\"Heave!\" Both men joined in the rhythmic call, putting their\nweight on the rope. The pot tilted more.\n\nThe half-formed sphere whistled loudly and the spheres circling\nover the plant answered.\n\n\"Hurry!\" Pember urged.\n\n\"Heave!\" chorused the men on the ropes. The pulleys creaked.\n\nThe room suddenly blazed with a brilliant orange glow as a\nmaddened sphere floated through the hole in the roof. It hung in\nthe air, pulsating, scanning what was taking place below.\n\n\"Heave!\" cried the two men. The pot was at an angle. The hatching\nsphere screamed to the globe above.\n\nThe floating sphere shrieked. Flame danced over its surface.\n\n\"It--It's got--eyes!\" Masters said, spacing his words with tugs\non the ropes.\n\n\"Don't look!\" Taylor warned. \"Heave!\"\n\nPember faced the sphere. He patted his Garand.\n\n\"Give 'im hell, boy!\"\n\nHe swung the rifle to his shoulder and fired. The bullet whined\noff the sphere as if it were steel. Pember jerked his head in\ndespair. Angrily he fired again. His tin hat slid to one side of\nhis head at a rakish angle.\n\n\"You spawn of hell!\" he cried.\n\nPember lowered his gun. The sphere pulsed ominously. Then the\ndoughboy charged.\n\nBeneath the brim of his helmet Pember's jaws were set. His\nhalf-closed eyes, glazed by the dazzling light from the sphere,\nwere two slits of savage determination.\n\nThere was something glorious in that charge. It was a soldier\ngoing into battle against hopeless odds. And it was more. The\narmy of human civilisation at that moment consisted of one buck\nprivate, pitting everything he had against something that even\nscience could not analyze.\n\nThe sudden attack seemed to surprise the sphere. It bounded back,\nmoving swiftly out of the way of the advancing one-man army.\n\nPember roared. There were no words in what he shouted. It was\njust a cry, the battle cry of humanity.\n\n\"Heave!\" chorused Taylor and Masters.\n\nThey too had a battle cry. Every man was doing his best and would\ndie doing it, if necessary.\n\nThere was a crack and a hiss. A flicker of flame flashed over the\ncharging soldier. An odor of charred human flesh filled the room.\n\nThen came a new sound, the hissing splash of spilled metal.\n\nThe pot was dumped.\n\nTaylor dropped the rope and faced the sphere. He saw the charred\npile of ashes beside the inhuman creature. Nearby was a fused\ntube of metal, all that was left of Pember's rifle.\n\n\"All right, you devil!\" shouted Taylor. \"Strike and be damned!\nThere's one thing you can't fix, and that's the metal pot. Your\nspores are dead. Your mistake was in having a metal pot for a\nmother!\"\n\nTaylor sensed understanding in the sphere. Those eyes that were\nnot eyes, but windows of the mind, seemed to fade. Flame licked\nout again from the monster, but it did not launch toward Taylor.\nNor was Masters the target.\n\nInstead, the flame reached toward the fading yellow hemisphere\nand the cooling pool of metal on the floor. There lay the hopes\nof the species on this planet, wrecked with a block and tackle.\n\n_Plop_!\n\nThe hemisphere exploded like a bubble.\n\n_Plop_!\n\nThe mourning sphere disappeared.\n\n_Plop. Plop. Plop._\n\nThree more spheres appeared in the opening in the roof and\nvanished.\n\nMasters tugged on Taylor's sleeve.\n\n\"Come on! We've got a chance, if we can get to the tunnel!\"\n\nTaylor shook his head.\n\n\"No need. We're safe now.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
