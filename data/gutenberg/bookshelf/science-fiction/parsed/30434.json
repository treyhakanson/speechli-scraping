Burris, Director of the\nFBI. He threw his hands in the air and looked baffled and confused.\n\nKenneth J. Malone tried to appear sympathetic. \"What what is?\"\n\nBurris frowned and drummed his fingers on his big desk. \"Malone,\" he\nsaid, \"make sense. And don't stutter.\"\n\n\"Stutter?\" Malone said. \"You said you didn't know what it was. And I\nwanted to know what it was.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" Burris said. \"I don't know.\"\n\nMalone sighed and repressed an impulse to scream. \"Now, wait a minute,\nChief--\" he started.\n\nBurris frowned again. \"Don't call me Chief,\" he said.\n\nMalone nodded, \"O.K.,\" he said. \"But--if you don't know what it is,\nyou must have some idea of what you don't know. I mean, is it larger\nthan a breadbox? Does it perform helpful tasks? Is it self-employed?\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris sighed, \"you ought to be on television.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Let me explain,\" Burris said. His voice was calmer now, and he spoke\nas if he were enunciating nothing but the most obvious and eternal\ntruths. \"The country,\" he said, \"is going to Hell in a handbasket.\"\n\nMalone nodded again. \"Well, after all, Chief--\" he started.\n\n\"Don't call me Chief,\" Burris said wearily.\n\n\"Anything you say,\" Malone agreed peacefully. He eyed the Director of\nthe FBI warily. \"After all, it isn't anything new,\" he went on. \"The\ncountry's always been going to Hell in a handbasket, one way or\nanother. Look at Rome.\"\n\n\"Rome?\" Burris said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Rome was always going to Hell in a handbasket,\nand finally it--\" He paused. \"Finally it did, I guess,\" he said.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Burris said. \"And so are we. Finally.\" He passed a hand\nover his forehead and stared past Malone at a spot on the wall. Malone\nturned and looked at the spot, but saw nothing of interest. \"Malone,\"\nBurris said, and the FBI Agent whirled around again.\n\n\"Yes, Ch--Yes?\" he said.\n\n\"This time,\" Burris said, \"it isn't the same old story at all. This\ntime it's different.\"\n\n\"Different?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded. \"Look at it this way,\" he said. His eyes returned to\nthe FBI Agent. \"Suppose you're a congressman,\" he went on, \"and you\nfind evidence of inefficiency in the government.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said agreeably. He had the feeling that if he\nwaited around a little while everything would make sense, and he was\nwilling to wait. After all, he wasn't on assignment at the moment, and\nthere was nothing pressing waiting for him. He was even between\nromances.\n\nIf he waited long enough, he told himself, Andrew J. Burris might say\nsomething worth hearing. He looked attentive and eager. He considered\nleaning over the desk a little, to look even more eager, but decided\nagainst it; Burris might think he looked threatening. There was no\ntelling.\n\n\"You're a congressman,\" Burris said, \"and the government is\ninefficient. You find evidence of it. What do you do?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone blinked and thought for a second. It didn't take any longer\nthan that to come up with the old, old answer. \"I start an\ninvestigation,\" he said. \"I get a committee and I talk to a lot of\nnewspaper editors and magazine editors and maybe I go on television\nand talk some more, and my committee has a lot of meetings--\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Burris said.\n\n\"And we talk a lot at the meetings,\" Malone went on, carried away,\n\"and get a lot of publicity, and we subpoena famous people, just as\nfamous as we can get, except governors or presidents, because you\ncan't--they tried that back in the '50s, and it didn't work very\nwell--and that gives us some more publicity, and then when we have all\nthe publicity we can possibly get--\"\n\n\"You stop,\" Burris said hurriedly.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"We stop. And that's what I'd do.\"\n\n\"Of course, the problem of inefficiency is left exactly where it\nalways was,\" Burris said. \"Nothing's been done about it.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Malone said. \"But think of all the lovely publicity. And\nall the nice talk. And the subpoenas and committees and everything.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Burris said wearily. \"It's happened a thousand times. But,\nMalone, that's the difference. It isn't happening this time.\"\n\nThere was a short pause. \"What do you mean?\" Malone said at last.\n\n\"This time,\" Burris said, in a tone that sounded almost awed, \"they\nwant to keep it a secret.\"\n\n\"A secret?\" Malone said, blinking. \"But that's ... that's not the\nAmerican way.\"\n\nBurris shrugged. \"It's un-congressman-like, anyhow,\" he said. \"But\nthat's what they've done. Tiptoed over to me and whispered softly that\nthe thing has to be investigated quietly. Naturally, they didn't give\nme any orders--but only because they know they can't make one stick.\nThey suggested it pretty strongly.\"\n\n\"Any reasons?\" Malone said. The whole idea interested him strangely.\nIt was odd--and he found himself almost liking odd cases, lately. That\nis, he amended hurriedly, if they didn't get _too_ odd.\n\n\"Oh, they had reasons, all right,\" Burris said. \"It took a little\ncoaxing, but I managed to pry some loose. You see, every one of them\nfound inefficiency in his own department. And every one knows that\nother men are investigating inefficiency.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Every one of them came to me to get me\nto prove that the goof-ups in his particular department weren't his\nfault. That covers them in case one of the others happens to light\ninto the department.\"\n\n\"Well, it must be _somebody's_ fault,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It isn't theirs,\" Burris said wearily. \"I ought to know. They told\nme. At great length, Malone.\"\n\nMalone felt a stab of honest pity. \"How many so far?\" he said.\n\n\"Six,\" Burris said. \"Four representatives, and two senators.\"\n\n\"Only two?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"the Senate is so much smaller. And, besides, we\nmay get more. As a matter of fact, Senator Lefferts is worth any six\nrepresentatives all by himself.\"\n\n\"He is?\" Malone said, puzzled. Senator Lefferts was not one of his\nfavorite people. Nor, as far as he knew, did the somewhat excitable\nsenator hold any place of honor in the heart of Andrew J. Burris.\n\n\"I mean his story,\" Burris said. \"I've never heard anything like\nit--at least, not since the Bilbo days. And I've only heard about\nthose,\" he added hurriedly.\n\n\"What story?\" Malone said. \"He talked about inefficiency--\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Burris said carefully. \"He said that somebody was out\nto get him--him, personally. He said somebody was trying to discredit\nhim by sabotaging all his legislative plans.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, feeling that some comment was called for, \"three\ncheers.\"\n\n\"That isn't the point,\" Burris snapped. \"No matter how we felt about\nSenator Lefferts or his legislative plans, we're sworn to protect him.\nAnd he says 'they' are out to get him.\"\n\n\"They?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You know,\" Burris said, shrugging. \"The great 'they.' The invisible\nenemies all around, working against him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Paranoid?\" He had always thought Senator Lefferts\nwas slightly on the batty side, and the idea of real paranoia didn't\ncome as too much of a surprise. After all, when a man was batty to\nstart out with ... and he even _looked_ like a vampire, Malone thought\nconfusedly.\n\n\"As far as paranoia is concerned,\" Burris said, \"I checked with one of\nour own psych men, and he'll back it up. Lefferts has definite\nparanoid tendencies, he says.\"\n\nMalone said, \"That's that.\"\n\nBurris shook his head. \"It isn't that simple,\" he said. \"You see,\nMalone, there's some evidence that somebody _is_ working against him.\"\n\n\"The American public, with any luck at all,\" Malone said.\n\n\"No,\" Burris said. \"An enemy. Somebody sabotaging his plans. Really.\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"You're crazy,\" he said.\n\nBurris looked shocked. \"Malone, I'm the Director of the FBI,\" he said.\n\"And if you insist on being disrespectful--\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone murmured. \"But--\"\n\n\"I am perfectly sane,\" Burris said slowly. \"It's Senator Lefferts\nwho's crazy. The only trouble is, he has evidence to show he's not.\"\n\nMalone thought about odd cases, and suddenly wished he were somewhere\nelse. Anywhere else. This one showed sudden signs of developing into\nsomething positively bizarre. \"I see,\" he said, wondering if he did.\n\n\"After all,\" Burris said, in a voice that attempted to sound\nreasonable, \"a paranoid has just as much right to be persecuted as\nanybody else, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Everybody has rights. But what do you want me to\ndo about that?\"\n\n\"About their rights?\" Burris said. \"Nothing, Malone. Nothing.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" Malone said patiently, \"about whatever it is that's going\non.\"\n\nBurris took a deep breath. His hands clasped behind his head, and he\nlooked up at the ceiling. He seemed perfectly relaxed. That, Malone\nknew, was a bad sign. It meant that there was a dirty job coming, a\njob nobody wanted to do, and one Burris was determined to pass off on\nhim. He sighed and tried to feel resigned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" the FBI Director said, \"the only actual trouble we can\npinpoint is that there seem to be a great many errors occurring in the\npaperwork--more than usual.\"\n\n\"People get tired,\" Malone said tentatively.\n\n\"But computer-secretary calculating machines don't,\" Burris said. \"And\nthat's where the errors are--in the computer-secretaries down in the\nSenate Office Building. I think you'd better start out there.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said sadly.\n\n\"See if there's any mechanical or electrical defect in any of those\ncomputers,\" Burris said. \"Talk to the computer technicians. Find out\nwhat's causing all these errors.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He was still trying to feel resigned, but he\nwasn't succeeding very well.\n\n\"And if you don't find anything--\" Burris began.\n\n\"I'll come right back,\" Malone said instantly.\n\n\"No,\" Burris said. \"You keep on looking.\"\n\n\"I do?\"\n\n\"You do,\" Burris said. \"After all, there has to be _something_ wrong.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said, \"if you say so. But--\"\n\n\"There are the interview tapes,\" Burris said, \"and the reports the\ncongressmen brought in. You can go through those.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"I guess so,\" he said.\n\n\"And there must be thousands of other things to do,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Well--\" Malone began cautiously.\n\n\"You'll be able to think of them,\" Burris said heartily. \"I know you\nwill. I have confidence in you, Malone. Confidence.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said sadly.\n\n\"You just keep me posted from time to time on what you're doing, and\nwhat ideas you get,\" Burris said. \"I'm leaving the whole thing in your\nhands, Malone, and I'm sure you won't disappoint me.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I know you will,\" Burris said warmly. \"And no matter how long it\ntakes--I know you'll succeed.\"\n\n\"No matter how long it takes?\" Malone said hesitantly.\n\n\"That's right!\" Burris said. \"You can do it, Malone! You can do it.\"\n\nMalone nodded slowly. \"I hope so,\" he said. \"Well, I ... well, I'll\nstart out right away, then.\"\n\nHe turned. Before he could make another move Burris said: \"Wait!\"\n\nMalone turned again, hope in his eyes. \"Yes, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"When you leave--\" Burris began, and the hope disappeared \"please do\none little favor for me. Just one little favor, because I'm an old,\ntired man and I'm not used to things any more.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Anything, Chief.\"\n\n\"Don't call me--\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris breathed heavily. \"When you leave,\" he said, \"please, please\nuse the door.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said, \"I've tried. I've really tried. Believe me.\nI've tried to get used to the fact that you can teleport. But--\"\n\n\"It's useful,\" Malone said, \"in my work.\"\n\n\"I can see that,\" Burris said. \"And I don't want you to ... well, to\nstop doing it. By no means. It's just that it sort of unnerves me, if\nyou see what I mean. No matter how useful it is for the FBI to have an\nagent who can go instantaneously from one place to another, it\nunnerves me.\" He sighed. \"I can't get used to seeing you disappear\nlike an over-dried soap bubble, Malone. It does something to\nme--here.\" He placed a hand directly over his sternum and sighed\nagain.\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Malone said. \"It unnerved me, too, the first\ntime I saw it. I thought I was going crazy, when that kid--Mike\nFueyo--winked out like a light. But then we got him, and some FBI\nagents besides me have learned the trick.\" He stopped there, wondering\nif he'd been tactful. After all, it took a latent ability to learn\nteleportation, and some people had it, while others didn't. Malone,\nalong with a few other agents, did. Burris evidently didn't--so he\ncouldn't teleport, no matter how hard he tried or how many lessons he\ntook.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"I'm still unnerved. So ... please, Malone ...\nwhen you come in here, or go out, use the door. All right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He turned and went out. As he opened the\ndoor, he could almost hear Burris' sigh of relief. Then he banged it\nshut behind him and, feeling that he might as well continue with his\nspacebound existence, walked all the way to the elevator, and rode it\ndownstairs to the FBI laboratories.\n\nThe labs, highly efficient and divided into dozens of departments,\ncovered several floors. Malone passed through the Fingerprint section,\nfilled with technicians doing strange things to great charts and\nslides, and frowning over tiny pieces of material and photographs.\nThen came Forgery Detection, involving many more technicians, many\nmore slides and charts and tiny pieces of things and photographs, and\neven a witness or two sitting on the white bench at one side and\nlooking lost and somehow civilian. Identification Classified was next,\na great barn of a room filled with index files. The real indexes were\nin the sub-basement; here, on microfilm, were only the basic division.\nA man was standing in front of one of the files, frowning at it.\nMalone went on by without stopping.\n\nCosmetic Surgery Classification came next. Here there were more indexes,\nand there were also charts and slides. There was an FBI agent sitting on a\nbench looking bored while two female technicians--classified as O&U for\nOld and Ugly in Malone's mind--fluttered around him, deciding what\ndisguises were possible, and which of those was indicated for the\nparticular job on hand. Malone waved to the agent, whom he knew very\nslightly, and went on. He felt vaguely regretful that the FBI couldn't\nhire prettier girls for the Cosmetic Surgery Division, but the trouble was\nthat pretty girls fell for the agents--and vice versa--and this led to an\nunfortunate tendency toward only handsome and virile-looking disguises.\nThe O&U Division was unfortunate, he decided, but a necessity.\n\nChemical Analysis (III) was next. The Chemical Analysis section was\nscattered over several floors, with the first stages up above.\nDivision III, Malone remembered, was devoted to non-poisonous\nsubstances--like clay or sand found in boots or trouser cuffs, cigar\nashes and such. They were placed on the same floor as Fingerprints to\nallow free and frequent passage between the sections on the problems\nof plastic prints--made in putty or like substances--and visible\nprints, made when the hand is covered with a visible substance like\nblood, ketchup or glue.\n\nMalone found what he was looking for at the very end of the floor. It\nwas the Computer Section, a large room filled with humming, clacking\nand buzzing machines of an ancient vintage, muttering to themselves as\nthey worked, and newer machines which were smaller and more silent.\nLights were lighting and bells were ringing softly, relays were\nrelaying and the whole room was a gigantic maze of calculating and\ncontrol machines. What space wasn't filled by the machines themselves\nwas filled by workbenches, all littered with an assortment of gears,\ntubes, spare relays, transistors, wires, rods, bolts, resistors and\nall the other paraphernalia used in building the machines and\nrepairing them. Beyond the basic room were other, smaller rooms, each\nassigned to a particular kind of computer work.\n\nThe narrow aisles were choked here and there with men who looked up as\nMalone passed by, but most of them gave him one quick glance and went\nback to work. A few didn't even do that, but went right on\nconcentrating on their jobs. Malone headed for a man working all alone\nin front of a workbench, frowning down at a complicated-looking\nmechanism that seemed to have neither head nor tail, and prodding at\nit with a long, thin screwdriver. The man was thin, too, but not very\nlong; he was a little under average height, and he had straight black\nhair, thick-lensed glasses and a studious expression, even when he was\nfrowning. He looked as if the mechanism were a student who had cut too\nmany classes, and he was being kindly but firm with it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone managed to get to the man's side, and coughed discreetly. There\nwas no response.\n\n\"Fred?\" he said.\n\nThe screwdriver waggled a little. Malone wasn't quite sure that the\nman was breathing.\n\n\"Fred Mitchell,\" he said.\n\nMitchell didn't look up. Another second passed.\n\n\"Hey,\" Malone said. Then he closed his eyes and took a deep breath.\n\"Fred,\" he said in a loud, reasonable-sounding voice, \"the State\nDepartment's translator has started to talk pig-Latin.\"\n\nMitchell straightened up as if somebody had jabbed him with a pin. The\nscrewdriver waved wildly in the air for a second, and then pointed at\nMalone. \"That's impossible,\" Mitchell said in a flat, precise voice.\n\"Simply impossible. It doesn't have a pig-Latin circuit. It can't\npossibly--\" He blinked and seemed to see Malone for the first time.\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Hello, Malone. What can I do for you?\"\n\nMalone smiled, feeling a little victorious at having got through the\nMitchell armor, which was almost impregnable when there was a job in\nhand. \"I've been standing here talking to you for some time.\"\n\n\"Oh, have you?\" Mitchell said. \"I was busy.\" That, obviously,\nexplained that. Malone shrugged.\n\n\"I want you to help me check over some calculators, Fred,\" he said.\n\"We've had some reports that some of the government machines are out\nof kilter, and I'd like you to go over them for me.\"\n\n\"Out of kilter?\" Fred Mitchell said. \"No, you can forget about it.\nIt's absolutely unnecessary to make a check--believe me. Absolutely.\nForget it.\" He smiled suddenly. \"I suppose it's some kind of a joke,\nisn't it?\" he said, just a trifle uncertainly. Fred Mitchell's world,\nwhile pleasant, did not include much humor, Malone knew. \"It's\nsupposed to be funny,\" he said in the same flat, precise voice.\n\n\"It isn't funny,\" Malone said.\n\nFred sighed. \"Then they're obviously lying,\" he said, \"and that's all\nthere is to it. Why bother me with it?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Fred said. He looked at the machinery with longing.\n\nMalone took a breath. \"How do you know?\" he said.\n\nFred sighed. \"It's perfectly obvious,\" he said in a patient tone.\n\"Since the State Department translator has no pig-Latin circuit, it\ncan't possibly be talking pig-Latin. I will admit that such a circuit\nwould be relatively easy to build, though it would have no utility as\nfar as I can see. Except, of course, for a joke.\" He paused. \"Joke?\"\nhe said, in a slightly uneasy tone.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Joke.\"\n\nMitchell looked relieved. \"Very well, then,\" he began. \"Since--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"The pig-Latin is a joke. That's right.\nBut I'm not talking about the pig-Latin.\"\n\n\"You're not?\" Mitchell asked, surprised.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said.\n\nMitchell frowned. \"But you said--\" he began.\n\n\"A joke,\" Malone said. \"You were perfectly right. The pig-Latin is a\njoke.\" He waited for Fred's expression to clear, and then added: \"But\nwhat I want to talk to you about isn't.\"\n\n\"It sounds very confused,\" Fred said after a pause. \"Not at all the\nsort of thing that ... that usually goes on.\"\n\n\"You have no idea,\" Malone said. \"It's about the political machines,\nall right, but it isn't anything as simple as pig-Latin.\" He\nexplained, taking his time over it.\n\nWhen he had finished, Fred was nodding his head slowly. \"I see,\" he\nsaid. \"I understand just what you want me to do.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll take a team over to the Senate Office Building,\" Fred said, \"and\ncheck the computer-secretaries there. That way, you see, I'll be able\nto do a full running check on them without taking any one machine out\nof operation for too long.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And it shouldn't take long,\" Fred went on, \"to find out just what the\ntrouble is.\" He looked very confident.\n\n\"How long?\" Malone asked.\n\nFred shrugged. \"Oh,\" he said, \"five or six days.\"\n\nMalone repressed an impulse to scream. \"Days?\" he said. \"I mean ...\nwell, look, Fred, it's important. Very important. Can't you do the job\nany faster?\"\n\nFred gave a little sigh. \"Checking and repairing all those machines,\"\nhe said, \"is an extremely complex job. Sometimes, Malone, I don't\nthink you realize quite how complex, and how delicate a job it is to\ndeal with such a high-order machine. Why--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Check and repair them?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Fred said.\n\n\"But I don't want them repaired,\" Malone said. Seeing the look of\nhorror on Fred's face, he added hastily: \"I only want a report from\nyou on what's wrong, whether they are actually making errors or not.\nAnd if they are making errors, just what's making them do it. And just\nwhat kind of errors. See?\"\n\nFred nodded very slowly. \"But I can't just ... just leave them there,\"\nhe said piteously. \"In ... pieces and everything. It isn't right,\nMalone. It just isn't right.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said with energy, \"you go right ahead and repair\nthem, if you want to. Fix 'em all up. But you can do that _after_ you\nmake the report to me, can't you?\"\n\n\"I--\" Fred hesitated. \"I had planned to check and repair each machine\non an individual basis--\"\n\n\"The Congress can allow for a short suspension,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow,\nthey can now--or as soon as I get the word to them. Suppose you check\nall the machines first, and then get around to the repair work.\"\n\n\"It's not the best way,\" Fred demurred.\n\nMalone discovered that it was his turn to sigh. \"Is it the fastest?\"\nhe said.\n\nFred nodded.\n\n\"Then it's the best,\" Malone said. \"How long?\"\n\nFred rolled his eyes to the ceiling and calculated silently for a\nsecond. \"Tomorrow morning,\" he announced, returning his gaze to\nMalone.\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Fine.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Never mind the buts,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"I'll count on hearing\nfrom you tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Oh--\" Fred said. \"All right.\"\n\n\"And if it looks like sabotage,\" Malone added, \"if the errors aren't\ncaused by normal wear and tear on the machines--you let me know right\naway. Phone me. Don't waste an instant.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I'll ... I'll start right away,\" Fred said heavily. He looked sadly\nat the mechanism he had been working on, and put his screwdriver down\nnext to it. It looked to Malone as if he were putting flowers on the\ngrave of a dear departed. \"I'll get a team together,\" Fred added. He\ngave the mechanism and screwdriver one last fond parting look.\n\nMalone looked after him for a second, thinking of nothing in\nparticular, and then turned in the opposite direction and headed back\ntoward the elevator. As he walked, he began to feel more and more\npleased with himself. After all, he'd gotten the investigation\nstarted, hadn't he?\n\nAnd now all he had to do was go back to his office and read some\nreports and listen to some interview tapes, and then he could go home.\n\nThe reports and the interview tapes didn't exactly sound like fun,\nMalone thought, but at the same time they seemed fairly innocent. He\nwould work his way through them grimly, and maybe he would even\nindulge his most secret vice and smoke a cigar or two to make the work\npass more pleasantly. Soon enough, he told himself, they would be\nfinished with.\n\nSometimes, though, he regretted the reputation he'd gotten. It had\nbeen bad enough in the old days--the pre-1971 days when Malone had\nthought he was just lucky. Burris had called him a Boy Wonder then,\nwhen he'd cracked three difficult cases in a row. Being just lucky had\nmade it a little tough to live with the Boy Wonder label--after all,\nMalone thought, it wasn't actually as if he'd done anything.\n\nBut since 1971 and the case of the Telepathic Spy, things had gotten\nworse. Much worse. Now Malone wasn't just lucky any more. Instead, he\ncould teleport and he could even foretell the future a little, in a\ndim sort of way. He'd caught the Telepathic Spy that way, and when the\ncase of the Teleporting Juvenile Delinquents had come up he'd been\nassigned to that one too, and he'd cracked it. Now Burris seemed to\nthink of him as a kind of god, and gave him all the tough dirty jobs.\n\nAnd if he wasn't just lucky any more, Malone couldn't think of himself\nas a Fearless, Heroic FBI Agent, either. He just wasn't the type. He\nwas--well, talented. That was the word, he told himself: talented. He\nhad all these talents and they made him look like something\nspectacular to Burris and the other FBI men. But he wasn't, really. He\nhadn't done anything really tough to get his talents; they'd just\nhappened to him.\n\nNobody, though, seemed to believe that. He heaved a little sigh and\nstepped into the waiting elevator.\n\nThere were, after all, he thought, compensations. He'd had some good\ntimes, and the talents did come in handy. And he did have his pick of\nthe vacation schedule lately. And he'd met some lovely girls--\n\nAnd besides, he told himself savagely as the elevator shot upward, he\nwasn't going to do anything except return to his office and read some\nreports and listen to some tapes. And then he was going to go home and\nsleep all night, peacefully. And in the morning Mitchell was going to\ncall him up and tell him that the computer-secretaries needed nothing\nmore than a little repair. He'd say they were getting old, and he'd be\na little pathetic about it; but it wouldn't be anything serious.\nMalone would send out orders to get the machines repaired, and that\nwould be that. And then the next case would be something both normal\nand exciting, like a bank robbery or a kidnapping involving a gorgeous\nblonde who would be so grateful to Malone that--\n\nHe had stepped out of the elevator and gone down the corridor without\nnoticing it. He pushed at his own office door and walked into the\nouter room. The train of thought he had been following was very nice,\nand sounded very attractive indeed, he told himself.\n\nUnfortunately, he didn't believe it. His prescient ability,\nfunctioning with its usual efficient aplomb, told Malone that things\nwould not be better, or simpler, in the morning. They would be worse,\nand more complicated.\n\nThey would be quite a lot worse.\n\nAnd, as usual, that prescience was perfectly accurate.\n\n\nII\n\nThe telephone, Malone realized belatedly, had had a particularly\nnasty-sounding ring. He might have known it would be bad news.\n\nAs a matter of fact, he told himself sadly, he had known.\n\n\"Nothing at all wrong?\" he said into the mouthpiece. \"Not with any of\nthe computers?\" He blinked. \"Not even one of them?\"\n\n\"Not a thing,\" Mitchell said. \"I'll be sending a report up to you in a\nlittle while. You read it; we put them through every test, and it's\nall detailed there.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you were very thorough,\" Malone said helplessly.\n\n\"Of course we were,\" Mitchell said. \"Of course. And the machines\npassed every single test. Every one. Malone, it was beautiful.\"\n\n\"Goody,\" Malone said at random. \"But there's got to be something--\"\n\n\"There is, Malone,\" Fred said. \"There is. I think there's definitely\nsomething odd going on. Something funny. I mean peculiar, not\nhumorous.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" Malone put in.\n\n\"Right,\" Fred said. \"Malone, try and relax. This is a hard thing to\nsay, and it must be even harder to hear. But--\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" Malone said. \"Who's dead? Who's been killed?\"\n\n\"I know it's tough, Malone,\" Fred went on.\n\n\"Is everybody dead?\" Malone said. \"It can't be just one person, not\nfrom that tone in your voice. Has somebody assassinated the entire\nSenate? Or the President and his Cabinet? Or--\"\n\n\"It's nothing like that, Malone,\" Fred said, in a tone that implied\nthat such occurrences were really rather minor. \"It's the machines.\"\n\n\"The machines?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Fred said grimly. \"After we checked them over and\nfound they were in good shape, I asked for samples of both the input\nand the output of each machine. I wanted to do a thorough job.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Malone said. \"What happened?\"\n\nFred took a deep breath. \"They don't agree,\" he said.\n\n\"They don't?\" Malone said. The phrase sounded as if it meant something\nmomentous, but he couldn't quite figure out what. In a minute, he\nthought confusedly, it would come to him. But did he want it to?\n\n\"They definitely do not agree,\" Fred was saying. \"The correlation is\nerratic; it makes no statistical sense. Malone, there are two\npossibilities.\"\n\n\"Tell me about them,\" Malone said. He was beginning to feel relieved.\nTo Fred, the malfunction of a machine was more serious than the murder\nof the entire Congress. But Malone couldn't quite bring himself to\nfeel that way about things.\n\n\"First,\" Fred said in a tense tone, \"it's possible that the\ntechnicians feeding information to the machines are making all kinds\nof mistakes.\"\n\nMalone nodded at the phone. \"That sounds possible,\" he said. \"Which\nones?\"\n\n\"All of them,\" Fred said. \"They're all making errors--and they're all\nmaking about the same number of errors. There don't seem to be any\nreal peaks or valleys, Malone; everybody's doing it.\"\n\nMalone thought of the Varsity Drag and repressed the thought. \"A bunch\nof fumblebums,\" he said. \"All fumbling alike. It does sound unlikely,\nbut I guess it's possible. We'll get after them right away, and--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Fred said. \"There is a second possibility.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Maybe they aren't mistakes,\" Fred said. \"Maybe the technicians are\ndeliberately feeding the machine with wrong answers.\"\n\nMalone hated to admit, even to himself, but that answer sounded a lot\nmore probable. Machine technicians weren't exactly picked off the\nstreets at random; they were highly trained for their work, and the\nidea of a whole crew of them starting to fumble at once, in a big way,\nwas a little hard to swallow.\n\nThe idea of all of them sabotaging the machines they worked on, Malone\nthought, was a tough one to take, too. But it had the advantage of\nmaking some sense. People, he told himself dully, will do nutty things\ndeliberately. It's harder to think of them doing the same nutty things\nwithout knowing it.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"however it turns out, we'll get to the\nbottom of it. Frankly, I think it's being done on purpose.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Fred said. \"And when you find out just who's making the\ntechnicians do such things--when you find out who gives them their\norders--you let me know.\"\n\n\"Let you know?\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Any man who would give false data to a perfectly innocent computer,\"\nFred said savagely, \"would ... would--\" For a second he was apparently\nlost for comparisons. Then he finished: \"Would kill his own mother.\"\nHe paused a second and added, in an even more savage voice: \"And then\nlie about it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe image on the screen snapped off, and Malone sat back in his chair\nand sighed. He spent a few minutes regretting that he hadn't chosen,\nearly in life, to be a missionary to the Fiji Islanders, or possibly\nsimply a drunken bum without any trouble, and then the report Mitchell\nhad mentioned arrived. Malone picked it up without much eagerness, and\nbegan going through it carefully.\n\nIt was beautifully typed and arranged; somebody on Mitchell's team had\nobviously been up all night at the job. Malone admired the work,\nwithout being able to get enthusiastic about the contents. Like all\ntechnical reports, it tended to be boring and just a trifle obscure to\nsomeone who wasn't completely familiar with the field involved. Malone\nand cybernetics were not exactly bosom buddies, and by the time he\nfinished reading through the report he was suffering from an extreme\ncase of _ennui_.\n\nThere were no new clues in the report, either; Mitchell's phone\nconversation had covered all of the main points. Malone put the sheaf\nof papers down on his desk and looked at them for a minute as if he\nexpected an answer to leap out from the pile and greet him with a glad\ncry, but nothing happened. Unfortunately, he had to do some more work.\n\nThe obvious next step was to start checking on the technicians who\nwere working on the machines. Malone determined privately that he\nwould give none of his reports to Fred Mitchell; he didn't like the\nidea of being responsible for murder, and that was the least Fred\nwould do to someone who confused his precious calculators.\n\nHe picked up the phone, punched for the Records Division, and waited\nuntil a bald, middle-aged face appeared. He asked the face to send up\nthe dossiers of the technicians concerned to his office. The face\nnodded.\n\n\"You want them right away?\" it said in a mild, slightly scratchy\nvoice.\n\n\"Sooner than right away,\" Malone said.\n\n\"They're coming up by messenger,\" the voice said.\n\nMalone nodded and broke the connection. The technicians had, of\ncourse, been investigated by the FBI before they'd been hired, but it\nwouldn't do any harm to check them out again. He felt grateful that he\nwouldn't have to do all that work himself; he would just go through\nthe dossiers and assign field agents to the actual checking when he\nhad a picture of what might need to be checked.\n\nHe sighed again and leaned back in his chair. He put his feet up on\nthe desk, remembered that he was entirely alone, and swung them down\nagain. He fished in a private compartment in his top desk drawer, drew\nout a cigar and unwrapped it. Putting his feet back on the desk, he\nlit the cigar, drew in a cloud of smoke, and lapsed into deep thought.\n\nCigar smoke billowed around him, making strange, fantastic shapes in\nthe air of the office. Malone puffed away, frowning slightly and\ntrying to force the puzzle he was working on to make some sense.\n\nIt certainly looked as though something were going on, he thought.\nBut, for the life of him, he couldn't figure out just what it was.\nAfter all, what could be anybody's purpose in goofing up a bunch of\ncalculators the way they had? Of course, the whole thing could be a\nseries of accidents, but the series was a pretty long one, and made\nMalone suspicious to start with. It was easier to assume that the\ngoof-ups were being done deliberately.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't make much sense as sabotage, either.\n\nSenator Deeds, for instance, had sent out a ten-thousand-copy form\nletter to his constituents, blasting an Administration power bill in\nextremely strong language, and asking for some comments on the\nDeeds-Hartshorn Air Ownership Bill, a pending piece of legislation\nthat provided for private, personal ownership, based on land title, to\nthe upper stratosphere--with a strong hint that rights of passage no\nlonger applied without some recompense to the owner of the air.\nNaturally, Deeds had filed the original with a computer-secretary to\nturn out ten thousand duplicate copies, and the machine had done so,\nfolding the copies, slipping them into addressed envelopes and sending\nthem out under the senator's franking stamp.\n\nThe addresses on the envelopes, however, had not been those of the\nsenator's supporters. The letter had been sent to ten thousand\nstockholders in major airline companies, and the senator's head was\nstill ringing from the force of the denunciatory letters, telegrams\nand telephone calls he'd been getting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then there was Representative Follansbee of South Dakota. A set of\nnews releases on the proposed Follansbee Waterworks Bill contained the\nstatement that the artificial lake which Follansbee proposed in the\nBlack Hills country \"be formed by controlled atomic power blasts, and\nfilled with water obtained from collecting the tears of widows and\norphans.\"\n\nNewsmen who saw this release immediately checked the bill. The wording\nwas exactly the same. Follansbee claimed that the \"widows and orphans\"\nphrase had appeared in his speech on the bill, and not in the proposed\nbill itself. \"It's completely absurd,\" he said, with commendable calm,\n\"to consider this method of filling an artificial lake.\"\nUnfortunately, the absurdity was now contained in the bill, which\nwould have to go back to committee for redefinition, and probably\nwouldn't come up again in the present session of Congress. Judging\nfrom the amount of laughter that had greeted the error when it had\ncome to light, Malone privately doubted whether any amount of\nredefinition was going to save it from a landslide defeat.\n\nRepresentative Keller of Idaho had made a speech which contained so\nmany errors in fact that newspaper editorials, and his enemies on the\nfloor of Congress, cut him to pieces with ease and pleasure. Keller\ncomplained of his innocence and said he'd gotten his facts from a\ncomputer-secretary, but this didn't save him. His re-election was a\nmatter for grave concern in his own party, and the opposition was,\nnaturally, tickled. They would not, Malone thought, dare to be tickled\npink.\n\nAnd these were not the only casualties. They were the most blatant\nfoul-ups, but there were others, such as the mistake in numbering of a\nHouse Bill that resulted in a two-month delay during which the\nopposition to the bill raised enough votes to defeat it on the floor.\nCommunications were diverted or lost or scrambled in small ways that\nmade for confusion--including, Malone recalled the perfectly horrible\nmixup that resulted when a freshman senator, thinking he was talking\nto his girlfriend on a blanked-vision circuit, discovered he was\ntalking to his wife.\n\nThe flow of information was being blocked by bottlenecks that suddenly\nexisted where there had never been bottlenecks before.\n\nAnd it wasn't only the computers, Malone knew. He remembered the\nreports the senators and representatives had made. Someone forgot to\nsend an important message here, or sent one too soon over there. Both\ncourses were equally disturbing, and both resulted in more snarl-ups.\nReports that should have been sent in weeks before arrived too late;\nreports meant for the eyes of only one man were turned out in\ntriplicate and passed all over the offices of Congress.\n\nEach snarl-up was a little one. But, together, they added up to\ninefficiency of a kind and extent that hadn't been seen, Malone told\nhimself with some wonder, since the Harding administration fifty years\nbefore.\n\nAnd there didn't seem to be anyone to blame anything on.\n\nMalone thought hopefully of sabotage, infiltration and mass treason,\nbut it didn't make him feel much better. He puffed out some more smoke\nand frowned at nothing.\n\nThere was a knock at the door of his office.\n\nSpeedily and guiltily, he swung his feet off the desk and snatched the\ncigar out of his mouth. He jammed it into a deep ashtray and put the\nashtray back into his desk drawer. He locked the drawer, waved\nineffectively at the clouds of smoke that surrounded him, and said in\na resigned voice: \"Come in.\"\n\nThe door opened. A tall, solidly built man stood there, wearing a\nfringe of beard and a cheerful expression. The man had an enormous\namount of muscle distributed more or less evenly over his chunky body,\nand a potbelly that looked as if he had swallowed a globe of the\nworld. In addition, he was smoking a cigarette and letting out little\npuffs of smoke, rather like a toy locomotive.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said, brushing feebly at the smoke that still\nwreathed him faintly. \"If it isn't Thomas Boyd, the FBI's answer to\nNero Wolfe.\"\n\n\"And if the physique holds true, you're Sherlock Holmes, I suppose,\"\nBoyd said.\n\nMalone shook his head, thinking sadly of his father and the cigar.\n\"Not exactly,\" he said. \"Not ex--\" And then it came to him. It wasn't\nthat he was ashamed of smoking cigars like his father, exactly--but\ncigars just weren't right for a fearless, dedicated FBI agent. And he\nhad just thought of a way to keep Boyd from knowing what he'd been\ndoing. \"That's a hell of a cigarette you're smoking, by the way,\" he\nsaid.\n\nBoyd looked at it. \"It is?\" he said.\n\n\"Sure is,\" Malone said, hoping he sounded sufficiently innocent.\n\"Smells like a cigar or something.\"\n\nBoyd sniffed the air for a second, his face wrinkled. Then he looked\ndown at his cigarette again. \"You're right, Ken. It _does_ smell like\na cigar.\" He came over to Malone's desk, looked around for an ashtray\nand didn't find one, and finally went to the window and tossed the\ncigarette out into the Washington breeze. \"How are things, anyhow,\nKen?\" he said.\n\n\"Things are confused,\" Malone said. \"Aren't they always?\"\n\nBoyd came back to the desk and sat down in a chair at one side of it.\nHe put his elbow on the desk. \"Sure they are,\" he said. \"I'm confused\nmyself, as a matter of fact. Only I think I know where I can get some\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd nodded. \"Burris told me I might be able to get some information\nfrom a certain famous and highly respected person,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said. \"Who?\"\n\n\"You,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, trying to look disappointed, flattered and modest\nall at the same time. \"Well,\" he went on after a second, \"anything I\ncan do--\"\n\n\"Burris thought you might have some answers,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Burris is getting optimistic in his old age,\" Malone said. \"I don't\neven have many questions.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"Well,\" he said, \"you know this California thing?\"\n\n\"Sure I do,\" Malone said. \"You're looking into the resignation out\nthere, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Senator Burley,\" Boyd said. \"That's right. But Senator Burley's\nresignation isn't all of it, by any means.\"\n\n\"It isn't?\" Malone said, trying to sound interested.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Boyd said. \"It goes a lot deeper than it looks on the\nsurface. In the past year, Ken, five senators have announced their\nresignations from the Senate of the United States. It isn't exactly a\nrecord--\"\n\n\"It sounds like a record,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"there was 1860 and the Civil War, when a whole lot\nof senators and representatives resigned all at once.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"But there isn't any Civil War going on now. At\nleast,\" he added, \"I haven't heard of any.\"\n\n\"That's what makes it so funny,\" Boyd said. \"Of course, Senator Burley\nsaid it was ill health, and so did two others, while Senator Davidson\nsaid it was old age.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"people do get old. And sick.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"The only trouble is--\" He paused. \"Ken,\" he said,\n\"do you mind if I smoke? I mean, do you mind the smell of cigars?\"\n\n\"Mind?\" Malone said. \"Not at all. Not at all.\" He blinked. \"Besides,\"\nhe added, \"maybe this one won't smell like a cigar.\"\n\n\"Well, the last one did,\" Boyd said. He took a cigarette out of a pack\nin his pocket, and lit it. He sniffed. \"You know,\" he said, \"You're\nright. This one doesn't.\"\n\n\"I told you,\" Malone said. \"Must have been a bad cigarette. Spoiled or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Boyd said vaguely. \"But about these retirements--the FBI\nwanted me to look into it because of Burley's being mixed up with the\nspace program scandal last year. Remember?\n\n\"Vaguely,\" Malone said. \"I was busy last year.\"\n\n\"Sure you were,\" Boyd said. \"We were both busy getting famous and\nwell-known.\"\n\nMalone grinned. \"Go on with the story,\" he said.\n\nBoyd puffed at his cigarette. \"Anyhow, we couldn't find anything\nreally wrong,\" he said. \"Three senators retiring because of ill\nhealth, one because of old age. And Farnsworth, the youngest. He had a\nnervous breakdown.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear about it,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd shrugged. \"We hushed it up,\" he said. \"But Farnsworth's got\ndelusions of persecution. He apparently thinks somebody's out to get\nhim. As a matter of fact, he thinks _everybody's_ out to get him.\"\n\n\"Now that,\" Malone said, \"sounds familiar.\"\n\nBoyd leaned back a little more in his chair. \"Here's the funny thing,\nthough,\" he said. \"The others all act as if they're suspicious of\neverybody who talks to them. Not anything obvious, you understand.\nJust--worried. Apprehensive. Always looking at you out of the corners\nof their eyes. That kind of thing.\"\n\nMalone thought of Senator Lefferts, who was also suffering from\ndelusions of persecution--delusions that had real evidence to back\nthem up. \"It does sound funny,\" he said cautiously.\n\n\"Well, I reported everything to Burris,\" Boyd went on. \"And he said\nyou were working on something similar, and we might as well pool our\nresources.\"\n\n\"Here we go again,\" Malone said. He took a deep breath, filling his\nnostrils with what remained of the cigar odor in the room, and felt\nmore peaceful. Quickly, he told Boyd about what had been happening in\nCongress. \"It seems pretty obvious,\" he finished, \"that there is some\nkind of a tie-up between the two cases.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's obvious,\" Boyd said, \"But it is just a little bit odd. Fun\nand games. You know, Ken, Burris was right.\"\n\n\"How?\" Malone said.\n\n\"He said everything was all mixed up,\" Boyd went on. \"He told me the\ncountry was going to Rome in a handbasket, or something like that.\"\n\nWondering vaguely if Burris had really been predicting mass religious\nconversions, Malone nodded silently.\n\n\"And he's right,\" Boyd said. \"Look at the newspapers. Everything's\nscrewy lately.\"\n\n\"Everything always is screwy,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not like now,\" Boyd said. \"So many big-shot gangsters have been\nkilled lately we might as well bring back Prohibition. And the labor\nunions are so busy with internal battles that they haven't had time to\ngo on strike for over a year.\"\n\n\"Is that bad?\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd shrugged. \"God knows,\" he said. \"But it's sure confusing as all\nhell.\"\n\n\"And now,\" Malone said, \"with all that going on--\"\n\n\"The Congress of the United States decides to go off its collective\nrocker,\" Boyd finished. \"Exactly.\" He stared down at his cigarette for\na minute with a morose and pensive expression on his face. He looked,\nMalone thought, like Henry VIII trying to decide what to do about all\nthese here wives.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen he looked up at Malone. \"Ken,\" he said in a strained voice,\n\"there seem to be a lot of nutty cases lately.\"\n\nMalone considered. \"No,\" he said at last. \"It's just that when a nutty\none comes along, we get it.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean,\" Boyd said. \"I wonder why that is.\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"It takes a thief to catch a thief,\" he said.\n\n\"But these aren't thieves,\" Boyd said. \"I mean--they're just nutty.\"\nHe paused. \"Oh,\" he said.\n\n\"And, two thieves are better than one,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Boyd said with a small, gusty sigh, \"it's company.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd looked for an ashtray, failed again to find one, and walked over\nto flip a second cigarette out onto Washington. He came back to his\nchair, sat down, and said: \"What's our next step, Ken?\"\n\nMalone considered carefully. \"First,\" he said finally, \"we'll start\nassuming something. We'll start assuming that there is some kind of\norganization behind all this--behind all the senators' resignations\nand everything like that.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a big assumption,\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"It isn't really,\" he said. \"After all, we\ncan't figure it's the work of one person: it's too widespread for\nthat. And it's silly to assume that everything's accidental.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Boyd said equably. \"It's an organization.\"\n\n\"Trying to subvert the United States,\" Malone went on. \"Reducing\neverything to chaos. And that brings in everything else, Tom. That\nbrings in the unions and the gang wars and everything.\"\n\nBoyd blinked. \"How?\" he said.\n\n\"Obvious,\" Malone said. \"Strife brought on by internal\nconfusion--that's what's going on all over. It's the same pattern. And\nif we assume an organization trying to jam up the United States, it\neven makes sense.\" He leaned back and beamed.\n\n\"Sure it makes sense,\" Boyd said. \"But who's the organization?\"\n\nMalone shrugged.\n\n\"If I were doing the picking,\" Boyd said, \"I'd pick the Russians. Or\nthe Chinese. Or both. Probably both.\"\n\n\"It's a possibility,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, if it's sabotage, who else\nwould be interested in sabotaging the United States? There's some\nRussian or Chinese organization fouling up Congress, and the unions,\nand the gangs. Come to think of it, why the gangs? It seems to me that\nif you left the professional gangsters strong, it would do even more\nto foul things up.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" Boyd said. \"Maybe they're trying to get rid of American\ngangsters so they can import some of their own.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any sense,\" Malone said, \"but I'll think about it.\nIn the meantime, we have one more interesting question.\"\n\n\"We do?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Sure we do,\" Malone said. \"The question is: How?\"\n\nBoyd said: \"Hm-m-m.\" Then there was silence for a little while.\n\n\"How are the saboteurs doing all this?\" Malone said. \"It just doesn't\nseem very probable that _all_ the technicians in the Senate Office\nBuilding, for instance, are spies. It makes even less sense that the\nlabor unions are composed mostly of spies. Or, for that matter, the\nMafia and the organizations like it. What would spies be doing in the\nMafia?\"\n\n\"Learning Italian,\" Boyd said instantly.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Malone said. \"If there were that many spies in this\ncountry, the Russians wouldn't have to fight at all. They could _vote_\nthe Communists into power--and by a nice big landslide, too.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Boyd said. \"If there aren't so many spies, then how\nis all this getting done?\"\n\nMalone beamed. \"That's the question,\" he said. \"And I think I have the\nanswer.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Boyd said. After a second he said: \"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"Suppose you tell me,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd opened his mouth. Nothing emerged. He shut it. A second passed\nand he opened it again. \"Magic?\" he said weakly.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"But you're getting warm.\"\n\nBoyd shut his eyes. \"I'm not going to stand for it,\" he announced.\n\"I'm not going to take any more.\"\n\n\"Any more what?\" Malone said. \"Tell me what you have in mind.\"\n\n\"I won't even consider it,\" Boyd said. \"It haunts me. It gets into my\ndreams. Now, look, Ken: I can't even see a pitchfork any more without\nthinking of Greek letters.\"\n\nMalone took a breath. \"Which Greek letter?\" he said.\n\n\"You know very well,\" Boyd said. \"What a pitchfork looks like. _Psi_.\nAnd I'm not even going to think about it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said equably, \"you won't have to. If you'd rather start\nwith the Russian spy end of things, you can do that.\"\n\n\"What I'd rather do,\" Boyd said, \"is resign.\"\n\n\"Next year,\" Malone said instantly. \"For now, you can wait around\nuntil the dossiers come up--they're for the Senate Office Building\ntechnicians, and they're on the way. You can go over them, and start\nchecking on any known Russian agents in the country for contacts. You\ncan also start checking on the dossiers, and in general for any\nhanky-panky.\"\n\nBoyd blinked. \"Hanky-panky?\" he said.\n\n\"It's a perfectly good word,\" Malone said, offended. \"Or two words.\nAnyhow, you can start on that end, and not worry about anything else.\"\n\n\"It's going to haunt me,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"eat lots of ectoplasm and get enough sleep, and\neverything will be fine. After all, I'm going to have to do the real\nend of the work--the psionics end. I may be wrong, but--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by the phone. He flicked the switch and Andrew J.\nBurris' face appeared on the screen.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said instantly, \"I just got a complaint from the\nState Department that ties in with your work. Their translator has\nbeen acting up.\"\n\nMalone couldn't say anything for a minute.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris went on. \"I said--\"\n\n\"I heard you,\" Malone said. \"And it doesn't have one.\"\n\n\"It doesn't have one what?\" Burris said.\n\n\"A pig-Latin circuit,\" Malone said. \"What else?\"\n\nBurris' voice was very calm. \"Malone,\" he said, \"what does pig-Latin\nhave to do with anything?\"\n\n\"You said--\"\n\n\"I said one of the State Department translators was acting up,\" Burris\nsaid. \"If you want details--\"\n\n\"I don't think I can stand them,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Some of the Russian and Chinese releases have come through with the\nmeaning slightly altered,\" Burris went on doggedly. \"And I want you to\ncheck on it right away. I--\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris blinked. \"What?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said. \"Never mind. I'm glad you told me, Chief.\nI'll get to work on it right away, and--\"\n\n\"You do that, Malone,\" Burris said. \"And stop calling me Chief! Do I\nlook like an Indian? Do I have feathers in my hair?\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Malone said grandly, \"is possible.\" He broke the\nconnection in a hurry.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe summer sun beat down on the white city of Washington, D. C. as if\nit had mistaken its instructions slightly, and was convinced that the\ncity had been put down somewhere in the Sahara. The sun seemed\nconfused, Malone thought. If this were the Sahara, obviously there was\nno reason whatever for the Potomac to be running through it. The sun\nwas doing its best to correct this small error, however, by exerting\neven more heat in a valiant attempt to dry up the river.\n\nIts attempt was succeeding, at least partially. The Potomac was still\nthere, but quite a lot of it was not in the river bed any more.\nInstead, it had gone into the air, which was so humid by now that\nMalone was willing to swear that it was splashing into his lungs at\nevery inhalation. Resisting an impulse to try the breast-stroke, he\nstood in the full glare of the straining sun, just outside the Senate\nOffice Building. He looked across at the Capitol, squinting his eyes\nmanfully against the glare of its dome in the brightness.\n\nThe Capitol was, at any rate, some relief from the sight of Thomas\nBoyd and a group of agents busily grilling two technicians. That was\ngoing on in the Senate Office Building, and Malone had come over to\nwatch the proceedings. Everything had been set up in what Malone\nconsidered the most complicated fashion possible. A big room had been\nturned into a projection chamber, and films were being run off over\nand over. The films, taken by hidden cameras watching the\ncomputer-secretaries, had caught two technicians red-handed punching\nerrors into the machines. Boyd had leaped on this evidence, and he and\nhis crew were showing the movies to the technicians and questioning\nthem under bright lights in an effort to break down their resistance.\n\nBut it didn't look as though they were going to have any more success\nthan the sun was having, turning Washington into the Sahara. After\nall, Malone told himself, wiping his streaming brow, there were no\nPyramids in Washington. He tried to discover whether that made any\nsense, but it was too much work. He went back to thinking about Boyd.\n\nThe technicians were sticking to their original stories, that the\nmistakes had been honest ones. It sounded like a sensible idea to\nMalone; after all, people did make mistakes. And the FBI didn't have a\nsingle shred of evidence to prove that the technicians were engaged in\ndeliberate sabotage. But Boyd wasn't giving up. Over and over he got\nthe technicians to repeat their stories, looking for discrepancies or\nslips. Over and over he ran off the films of their mistakes, looking\nfor some clue, some shred of evidence.\n\nEven the sight of the Capitol, Malone told himself sadly, was better\nthan any more of Boyd's massive investigation techniques.\n\nHe had come out to do some thinking. He believed, in spite of a good\ndeal of evidence to the contrary, that his best ideas came to him\nwhile walking. At any rate, it was a way of getting away from four\nwalls and from the prying eyes and anxious looks of superiors. He\nsighed gently, crammed his hat onto his head and started out.\n\nOnly a maniac, he reflected, would wear a hat on a day like the one he\nwas swimming through. But the people who passed him as he trudged\nonward to no particular destination didn't seem to notice; they gave\nhim a fairly wide berth, and seemed very polite, but that wasn't\nbecause they thought he was nuts, Malone knew. It was because they\nknew he was an FBI man.\n\nThat was the result of an FBI regulation. All agents had to wear hats.\nMalone wasn't sure why, and his thinking on the matter had only\ndredged up the idea that you had to have a hat in case somebody asked\nyou to keep something under it. But the FBI was firm about its\nrulings. No matter what the weather, an agent wore a hat. Malone\nthought bitterly that he might just as well wear a red, white and blue\nluminous sign that said _FBI_ in great winking letters, and maybe a\nhooting siren, too. Still, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not\nsupposed to be a secret organization--no matter what occasional\ncritics might say. And the hats, at least as long as the weather\nremained broiling, were enough proof of that for anybody.\n\nMalone could feel water collecting under his hat and soaking his head.\nHe removed the hat quickly, wiped his head with a handkerchief and\nreplaced the hat, feeling as if he had become incognito for a few\nseconds. The hat was back on now, feeling official but terrible, and\nabout the same was true of the fully-loaded Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum\nrevolver which hung in his shoulder holster. The harness chafed at his\nshoulder and chest and the weight of the gun itself was an added and\nunwelcome burden.\n\nBut even without the gun and the hat, Malone did not feel exactly\nchipper. His shirt and undershirt were no longer two garments, but\none, welded together by seamless sweat and plastered heavily and not\ntoo skillfully to his skin. His trouser legs clung damply to calves\nand thighs, rubbing as he walked, and at the knees each trouser leg\nattached and detached itself with the unpleasant regularity of a wet\nbastinado. Inside Malone's shoes, his socks were completely awash, and\nhe seemed to squish as he walked. It was hard to tell, but there\nseemed to be a small fish in his left shoe. It might, he told himself,\nbe no more than a pebble or a wrinkle in his sock. But he was willing\nto swear that it was swimming upstream.\n\nAnd the forecast, he told himself bitterly, was for continued warm.\n\nHe forced himself to take his mind off his own troubles and get back\nto the troubles of the FBI in general, such as the problem at hand. It\nwas an effort, but he frowned and kept walking, and within a block he\nwas concentrating again on the _psi_ powers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Psi_, he told himself, was behind the whole mess. In spite of Boyd's\nhorrified refusal to believe such a thing, Malone was sure of it.\nThree years ago, of course, he wouldn't have considered the notion\neither. But since then a great many things had happened, and his\nhorizons had widened. After all, capturing a double handful of totally\ninsane, if perfectly genuine telepaths, from asylums all over the\ncountry, was enough by itself to widen quite a few stunned horizons.\nAnd then, later, there had been the gang of juvenile delinquents. They\nhad been perfectly normal juvenile delinquents, stealing cars and\nbopping a stray policeman or two. It just happened, though, that they\nhad solved the secret of instantaneous teleportation, too. This made\nthem just a trifle unusual.\n\nIn capturing them, Malone, too, had learned the teleportation secret.\nUnlike Boyd, he thought, or Burris, the idea of psionic power didn't\nbother him much. After all, the psionic spectrum--if it was a spectrum\nat all--was just as much a natural phenomenon as gravity, or\nmagnetism.\n\nIt was just a little hard for some people to get used to.\n\nAnd, of course, he didn't fully understand _how_ it worked, or _why_.\nThis put him in the position, he told himself, of an Australian\naborigine. He tried to imagine an Australian aborigine in a hat on a\nhot day, decided the aborigine would have too much sense, and got back\noff the subject again.\n\nHowever, he thought grimly, there was this Australian aborigine. And\nhe had a magnifying glass, which he'd picked up from the wreck of some\nship. Using that--assuming that experience, or a friendly missionary,\ntaught him how--he could manage to light a fire, using the sun's\nthermonuclear processes to do the job. Malone doubted that the\naborigine knew anything about thermonuclear processes, but he could\nstart a fire with them.\n\nAs a matter of fact, he told himself, the aborigine didn't understand\noxidation, either. But he could use that fire, when he got it going.\nIn spite of his lack of knowledge, the aborigine could use that nice,\nhot, burning fire ...\n\nHurriedly, Malone pried his thoughts away from aborigines and heat,\nand tried to focus his mind elsewhere. He didn't understand psionic\nprocesses, he thought; but then, nobody did, really, as far as he\nknew. But he could use them.\n\nAnd, obviously, somebody else could use them, too.\n\nOnly what kind of force was being used? What kind of psionic force\nwould it take to make so many people in the United States goof up the\nway they were doing?\n\nThat, Malone told himself, was a good question, a basic and an\nimportant question. He was proud of himself for thinking of it.\n\nUnfortunately, he didn't have the answer.\n\nBut he thought he knew a way of getting one.\n\nIt was perfectly true that nobody knew much about how psionics worked.\nFor that matter, nobody knew very much about how gravity worked. But\nthere was still some information--and, in the case of psionics, Malone\nknew where it was to be found.\n\nIt was to be found in Yucca Flats, Nevada.\n\nIt was, of course, true that Nevada would probably be even hotter than\nWashington, D. C. But there was no help for that, Malone told himself\nsadly; and, besides, the cold chill of the expert himself would\nprobably cool things off quite rapidly. Malone thought of Dr. Thomas\nO'Connor, the Westinghouse psionics expert and frowned. O'Connor was\nnot exactly what might be called a friendly man.\n\nBut he did know more about psionics than anyone else Malone could\nthink of. And his help had been invaluable in solving the two previous\npsionic cases Malone had worked on.\n\nFor a second he thought of calling O'Connor, but he brushed that\nthought aside bravely. In spite of the heat of Yucca Flats, he would\nhave to talk to the man personally. He thought again of O'Connor's\ncongealed personality, and wondered if it would really be effective in\ncombating the heat. If it were, he told himself, he would take the man\nright back to Washington with him, and plug him into the\nair-conditioning lines.\n\nHe sighed deeply, thought about a cigar and decided regretfully\nagainst it, here on the public street where he would be visible to\nanyone. Instead, he looked around him, discovered that he was only a\nblock from a large, neon-lit drugstore and headed for it. Less than a\nminute later he was in a phone booth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe operators throughout the country seemed to suffer from heat\nprostration, and Malone was hardly inclined to blame them. But, all\nthe same, it took several minutes for him to get through to Dr.\nO'Connor's office, and a minute or so more before he could convince a\nsecurity-addled secretary that, after all, he would hardly blow\nO'Connor to bits over the long-distance phone.\n\nFinally the secretary, with a sigh of reluctance, said she would see\nif Dr. O'Connor were available. Malone waited in the phone booth,\nopening the door every few seconds to breathe. The booth was\nair-conditioned, but remained for some mystical reason an even ten\ndegrees above the boiling point of Malone's temper.\n\nFinally Dr. O'Connor's lean, pallid face appeared on the screen. He\nhad not changed since Malone had last seen him. He still looked, and\nacted, like one of Malone's more disliked law professors.\n\n\"Ah,\" the scientist said in a cold, precise voice. \"Mr. Malone. I am\nsorry for our precautions, but you understand that security must be\nserved.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Being an FBI man, of course you would,\" Dr. O'Connor went on, his\nface changing slightly and his voice warming almost to the boiling\npoint of nitrogen. It was obvious that the phrase was Dr. O'Connor's\nidea of a little joke, and Malone smiled politely and nodded. The\nscientist seemed to feel some friendliness toward Malone, though it\nwas hard to tell for sure. But Malone had brought him some fine\nspecimens to work with--telepaths and teleports, though human, being\nno more than specimens to such a very precise scientific mind--and he\nseemed grateful for Malone's diligence and effort in finding such\nfascinating objects of study.\n\nThat Malone certainly hadn't started out to find them made, it\nappeared, very little difference.\n\n\"Well, then,\" O'Connor said, returning to his normal, serious tone,\n\"what can I do for you, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"If you have the time, doctor,\" Malone said respectfully, \"I'd like to\ntalk to you for a few minutes.\" He had the absurd feeling that\nO'Connor was going to tell him to stop by after class, but the\nscientist only nodded.\n\n\"Your call is timed very well,\" he said. \"As it happens, Mr. Malone, I\ndo have a few seconds to spare just now.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I should be glad to talk with you,\" O'Connor said, without looking\nany more glad than ever.\n\n\"I'll be right there,\" Malone said. O'Connor nodded again, and blanked\nout. Malone switched off and took a deep, superheated breath of phone\nbooth air. For a second he considered starting his trip from outside\nthe phone booth, but that was dangerous--if not to Malone, then to\ninnocent spectators. Psionics was by no means a household word, and\nthe sight of Malone leaving for Nevada might send several citizens\nstraight to the wagon. Which was not a place, he thought judiciously,\nfor anybody to be on such a hot day.\n\nHe closed his eyes for a fraction of a second. In that time he\nreconstructed from memory a detailed, three-dimensional, full-color\nimage of Dr. O'Connor's office in his mind. It was perfect in detail;\nhe checked it over mentally and then, by a special effort of will, he\ngave himself the psychic push that made the transition possible.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was in O'Connor's office, standing in\nfront of the scientist's wide desk. He hoped nobody had been looking\ninto the phone booth at the instant he had disappeared; but he was\nreasonably sure he'd been unobserved. People didn't go around peering\ninto phone booths, after all, and he had seen no one.\n\nO'Connor looked up without surprise. \"Ah,\" he said. \"Sit down, Mr.\nMalone.\" Malone looked around for the chair, which was an\nuncomfortably straight-backed affair, and sat down in it gingerly.\nRemembering past visits to O'Connor, he was grateful for even the\nsmall amount of relaxation the hard wood afforded him. O'Connor had\nonly recently unbent to the point of supplying a spare chair in his\noffice for visitors, and, apparently, especially for Malone. Perhaps,\nMalone thought, it was more gratitude for the lovely specimens.\n\nMalone still felt uncomfortable, but tried bravely not to show it. He\nfelt slightly guilty, too, as he always did when he popped into\nO'Connor's office without bothering to stay spacebound. By law, after\nall, he knew he should check in and out at the main gate of the huge,\nultra-top-secret government reservation whenever he visited Yucca\nFlats. But that meant wasting a lot of time and going through a lot of\ntrouble. Malone had rationalized it out for himself that way, and had\ngot just far enough to do things the quick and easy way, and not quite\nfar enough to feel undisturbed about it. After all, he told himself\ngrimly, anything that saved time and trouble increased the efficiency\nof the FBI, so it was all to the good.\n\nHe swallowed hard. \"Dr. O'Connor--\" he began.\n\nO'Connor looked up again. \"Yes?\" he said. He'd had plenty of practice\nin watching people appear and disappear, between Malone and the\nspecimens Malone had brought him; he was beyond surprise or shock by\nnow.\n\n\"I came here to talk to you,\" Malone began again.\n\nO'Connor nodded, a trifle impatiently. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I know that.\"\n\n\"Well--\" Malone thought fast. Presenting the case to O'Connor was\nimpossible; it was too complicated, and it might violate governmental\nsecrecy somewhere along the line. He decided to wrap it up in a\nhypothetical situation. \"Doctor,\" he said, \"I know that all the\nvarious manifestations of the _psi_ powers were investigated and named\nlong before responsible scientists became interested in the subject.\"\n\n\"That,\" O'Connor said with some reluctance, \"is true.\" He looked sad,\nas if he wished they'd waited on naming some of the psionic\nmanifestations until he'd been born and started investigating them.\nMalone tried to imagine a person doing something called O'Connorizing,\nand decided he was grateful for history.\n\n\"Well, then--\" he said.\n\n\"At least,\" O'Connor cut in, \"it is true in a rather vague and general\nway. You see, Mr. Malone, any precise description of a psionic\nmanifestation must wait until a metalanguage has grown up to encompass\nit; that is, until understanding and knowledge have reached the point\nwhere careful and accurate description can take place.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said helplessly. \"Sure.\" He wondered if what O'Connor had\nsaid meant anything, and decided that it probably did, but he didn't\nwant to know about it.\n\n\"While we have not yet reached that point,\" O'Connor said, \"we are\napproaching it in our experiments. I am hopeful that, in the near\nfuture--\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone cut in desperately, \"sure. Of course. Naturally.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. O'Connor looked miffed. The temperature of the room seemed to\ndrop several degrees, and Malone swallowed hard and tried to look\ningratiating and helpful, like a student with nothing but A's on his\nrecord.\n\nBefore O'Connor could pick up the thread of his sentence, Malone went\non: \"What I mean is something like this. Picking up the mental\nactivity of another person is called telepathy. Floating in the air is\ncalled levitation. Moving objects around is psychokinesis. Going from\none place to another instantaneously is teleportation. And so on.\"\n\n\"The language you use,\" O'Connor said, still miffed, \"is extremely\nloose. I might go so far as to say that the statements you have made\nare, essentially, meaningless as a result of their lack of rigor.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"Dr. O'Connor,\" he said, \"you know what I\nmean, don't you?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" O'Connor said, with the air of a king granting a\npardon to a particularly repulsive-looking subject in the lowest\nincome brackets.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said. \"Yes or no?\"\n\nO'Connor frowned. \"Yes or no what?\" he said.\n\n\"I\" Malone blinked. \"I meant, the things have names,\" he said at last.\n\"All the various psionic manifestations have names.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" O'Connor said. \"Well. I should say.\" He put his fingertips\ntogether and stared at a point on the white ceiling for a second.\n\"Yes,\" he said at last.\n\nMalone breathed a sigh of relief. \"Good,\" he said. \"That's what I\nwanted to know.\" He leaned forward. \"And if they all do have names,\"\nhe went on, \"what is it called, when a large group of people are\nforced to act in a certain manner?\"\n\nO'Connor shrugged. \"Forced?\" he said.\n\n\"Forced by mental power,\" Malone said.\n\nThere was a second of silence.\n\n\"At first,\" O'Connor said, \"I might think of various examples: the\nactions of a mob, for example, or the demonstrations of the Indian\nRope Trick, or perhaps the sale of a useless product through\ntelevision or through other advertising.\" Again his face moved, ever\nso slightly, in what he obviously believed to be a smile. \"The usual\nname for such a phenomenon is 'mass hypnotism,' Mr. Malone,\" he said.\n\"But that is not, strictly speaking, a _psi_ phenomenon at all.\nStudies in that area belong to the field of mob psychology; they are\nnot properly in my scope.\" He looked vastly superior to anything and\neverything that was outside his scope. Malone concentrated on looking\nreceptive and understanding.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said.\n\nO'Connor gave him a look that made Malone feel he'd been caught\ncribbing during an exam, but the scientist said nothing to back up the\nlook. Instead, he went on: \"I will grant that there may be an\namplification of the telepathic faculty in the normal individual in\nsuch cases.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said doubtfully.\n\n\"Such an amplification,\" O'Connor went on, as if he hadn't heard,\n\"would account for the apparent ... ah ... mental linkage that makes a\nmob appear to act as a single organism during certain periods of ...\nah ... stress.\" He looked judicious for a second, and then nodded.\n\"However,\" he said, \"other than that, I would doubt that there is any\npsionic force involved.\"\n\nMalone spent a second or two digesting O'Connor's reply. \"Well,\" he\nsaid at last, \"I'm not sure that's what I meant. I mean, I'm not sure\nI meant to ask that question.\" He took a breath and decided to start\nall over. \"It's not like a mob,\" he said, \"with everybody all doing\nthe same thing at the same time. It's more like a group of men, all\nseparated, without any apparent connections between any of the men.\nAnd they're all working toward a common goal. All doing different\nthings, but all with the same objective. See?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" O'Connor said flatly. \"But what you're suggesting--\"\nHe looked straight at Malone. \"Have you had any experience of this ...\nphenomenon?\"\n\n\"Experience?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I believe you have had,\" O'Connor said. \"Such a concept could not\nhave come to you in a theoretical manner. You must be involved with an\nactual situation very much like the one you describe.\"\n\nMalone swallowed. \"Me?\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. \"May I remind you that this is Yucca\nFlats? That the security checks here are as careful as anywhere in the\nworld? That I, myself, have top-security clearance for my special\nprojects? You do not need to watch your words here.\"\n\n\"It's not security,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, it's not only security. But\nthings are pretty complicated.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" O'Connor said, \"that I will be able to understand even\nevents which you feel are complex.\"\n\nMalone swallowed again, hard. \"I didn't mean--\" he started.\n\n\"Please, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. His voice was colder than usual.\nMalone had the feeling that he was about to take the extra chair away.\n\"Go on,\" O'Connor said. \"Explain yourself.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. He started with the facts he'd been told by\nBurris, and went straight through to the interviews of the two\ncomputer-secretary technicians by Boyd and Company.\n\nIt took quite a while. By the time he had finished, O'Connor wasn't\nlooking frozen any more; he'd apparently forgotten to keep the freezer\ncoils running. Instead, his face showed frank bewilderment, and great\ninterest. \"I never heard of such a thing,\" he said. \"Never. Not at any\ntime.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nO'Connor shook his head. \"I have never heard of a psionic\nmanifestation on that order,\" he said. It seemed to be a painful\nadmission. \"Something that would make a random group of men co-operate\nin that manner--why, it's completely new.\"\n\n\"It is?\" Malone said, wondering if, when it was all investigated and\ndescribed, it might be called O'Connorizing. Then he wondered how\nanybody was going to go about investigating it and describing it, and\nsank even deeper into gloom.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Completely new,\" O'Connor said. \"You may take my word.\" Then, slowly,\nhe began to brighten again, with all the glitter of newly-formed ice.\n\"As a matter of fact,\" he said, in a tone more like his usual one,\n\"Mr. Malone, I don't think it's possible.\"\n\n\"But it happened,\" Malone said. \"It's still happening. All over.\"\n\nO'Connor's lips tightened. \"I have given my opinion,\" he said. \"I do\nnot believe that such a thing is possible. There must be some other\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said agreeably. \"I'll bite. What is it?\"\n\nO'Connor frowned. \"Your levity,\" he said, \"is uncalled-for.\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I didn't mean to be--\" he paused. \"Anyhow, I didn't\nmean to be funny,\" he went on. \"But I would like to have another idea\nof what's causing all this.\"\n\n\"Scientific theories,\" O'Connor said sternly, \"are not invented on the\nspur of the moment. Only after long, careful thought--\"\n\n\"You mean you can't think of anything,\" Malone said.\n\n\"There must be some other explanation,\" O'Connor said. \"Naturally,\nsince the facts have only now been presented to me, it is impossible\nfor me to display at once a fully constructed theory.\"\n\nMalone nodded slowly. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"Have you got any hints, then?\nAny ideas at all?\"\n\nO'Connor shook his head. \"I have not,\" he said. \"But I strongly\nsuggest, Mr. Malone, that you recheck your data. The fault may very\nwell lie in your own interpretations of the actual facts.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Malone said.\n\nO'Connor grimaced. \"I do,\" he said firmly.\n\nMalone sighed, very faintly. He shifted in the chair and began to\nrealize, for the first time, just how uncomfortable it really was. He\nalso felt a little chilly, and the chill was growing. That, he told\nhimself, was the effect of Dr. O'Connor. He no longer regretted\nwearing his hat. As a matter of fact, he thought wistfully for a\nsecond of a small, light overcoat.\n\nO'Connor, he told himself, was definitely not the warm, friendly type.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, conquering the chilly feeling for a second,\n\"maybe there's somebody else. Somebody who knows something more about\npsionics, and who might have some other ideas about--\"\n\n\"Please, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. \"The United States Government\nwould hardly have chosen me had I not been uniquely qualified in my\nfield.\"\n\nMalone sighed again. \"I mean ... maybe there are some books on the\nsubject,\" he said quietly, hoping he sounded tactful. \"Maybe there's\nsomething I could look up.\"\n\n\"Mr. Malone.\" The temperature of the office, Malone realized, was\ndefinitely lowering. O'Connor's built-in freezer coils were working\novertime, he told himself. \"The field of psionics is so young that I\ncan say, without qualification, that I am acquainted with everything\nwritten on the subject. By that, of course, I mean scientific works. I\ndo not doubt that the American Society for Psychical Research, for\ninstance, has hundreds of crackpot books which I have never read, or\neven heard of. But in the strictly scientific field, I must say\nthat--\"\n\nHe broke off, looking narrowly at Malone with what might have been\nconcern, but looked more like discouragement and boredom.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"are you ill?\"\n\nMalone thought about it. He wasn't quite sure, he discovered. The\nchill in the office was bothering him more and more, and as it grew he\nbegan to doubt that it was all due to the O'Connor influence. Suddenly\na distinct shudder started somewhere in the vicinity of his shoulders\nand rippled its way down his body.\n\nAnother one followed it, and then a third.\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said. \"I'm ... I'm all right.\"\n\n\"You seem to have contracted a chill,\" O'Connor said.\n\nA fourth shudder followed the other three.\n\n\"I ... guess so,\" Malone said. \"I d-d ... I do s-seem to be r-r-rather\nchilly.\"\n\nO'Connor nodded. \"Ah,\" he said. \"I thought so. Although a chill is\ncertainly odd at seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit.\" He looked at the\nthermometer just outside the window of his office, then turned back to\nMalone. \"Pardon me,\" he said. \"Seventy-one point six.\"\n\n\"Is ... is that all it is?\" Malone said. Seventy-one point six\ndegrees, or even seventy-two, hardly sounded like the broiling Nevada\ndesert he'd expected.\n\n\"Of course,\" O'Connor said. \"At nine o'clock in the morning, one would\nhardly expect great temperatures. The desert becomes quite hot during\nthe day, but cools off rapidly; I assume you are familiar with the\nlaws covering the system.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"S-sure.\"\n\nThe chills were not getting any better. They continued to travel up\nand down his body with the dignified regularity of Pennsylvania\nRailroad commuter trains.\n\nO'Connor frowned for a second. It was obvious that his keen scientific\neye was sizing up the phenomenon, and reporting events to his keen\nscientific brain. In a second or less, the keen scientific brain had\ncome up with an answer, and Dr. O'Connor spoke in his very keenest\nscientific voice.\n\n\"I should have warned you,\" he said, without an audible trace of\nregret. \"The answer is childishly simple, Mr. Malone. You left\nWashington at noon.\"\n\n\"Just a little before noon,\" Malone said. Remembering the burning sun,\nhe added: \"High noon. Very high.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" O'Connor said. \"And not only the heat was intense; the\nhumidity, I assume, was also high.\"\n\n\"Very,\" Malone said, thinking back. He shivered again.\n\n\"In Washington,\" O'Connor said, \"it was noon. Here it is nine o'clock,\nand hardly as warm. The atmosphere is quite arid, and about twenty\ndegrees below that obtaining in Washington.\"\n\nMalone thought about it, trying to ignore the chills. \"Oh,\" he said at\nlast. \"And all the time I thought it was you.\"\n\n\"What?\" O'Connor leaned forward.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said hastily.\n\n\"My suggestion,\" O'Connor said, putting his fingertips together again,\n\"is that you take off your clothes, which are undoubtedly damp, and--\"\n\nNaturally, Malone had not brought any clothes to Yucca Flats to change\ninto. And when he tried to picture himself in a spare suit of Dr.\nO'Connor's, the picture just wouldn't come. Besides, the idea of doing\na modified strip-tease in, or near, the O'Connor office was thoroughly\nunattractive.\n\n\"Well,\" he said slowly, \"thanks a lot, doctor, but no thanks. I really\nhave a better idea.\"\n\n\"Better?\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"Well, I--\" Malone took a deep breath and shut his eyes.\n\nHe heard Dr. O'Connor say: \"Well, Mr. Malone--good-by. And good luck.\"\n\nThen the office in Yucca Flats was gone, and Malone was standing in\nthe bedroom of his own apartment, on the fringes of Washington, D. C.\n\n\nIV\n\nHe walked over to the wall control and shut off the air-conditioning\nin a hurry. He threw open a window and breathed great gulps of the\nhot, humid air from the streets. In a small corner at the back of his\nmind, he wondered why he was grateful for the air he had suffered\nunder only a few minutes before. But that, he reflected, was life. And\na very silly kind of life, too, he told himself without rancor.\n\nIn a few minutes he left the window, somewhat restored, and headed for\nthe shower. When it was running nicely and he was under it, he started\nto sing. But his voice didn't sound as much like the voice of Lauritz\nMelchior as it usually did, not even when he made a brave, if\nfoolhardy stab at the Melchior accent. Slowly, he began to realize\nthat he was bothered.\n\nHe climbed out of the shower and started drying himself. Up to now, he\nthought, he had depended on Dr. Thomas O'Connor for edifying,\ntrustworthy and reasonably complete information about psionics and\n_psi_ phenomena in general. He had looked on O'Connor as a sort of\nliving version of an extremely good edition of the _Britannica_,\nalways available for reference.\n\nAnd now O'Connor had failed him. That, Malone thought, was hardly\nfair. O'Connor had no business failing him--particularly when there\nwas no place else to go.\n\nThe scientist had been right, of course, Malone knew. There was no\nother scientist who knew as much about psionics as O'Connor, and if\nO'Connor said there were no books, then that was that: there were no\nbooks.\n\nHe reached for a drawer in his dresser, opened it and pulled out some\nunderclothes, humming tunelessly under his breath as he dressed. If\nthere was no one to ask, he thought, and if there were no books--\n\nHe stopped with a sock in his hand, and stared at it in wonder.\nO'Connor hadn't said there were no books. As a matter of fact, Malone\nrealized, he'd said exactly the opposite.\n\nThere were books. But they were \"crackpot\" books. O'Connor had never\nread them. He had, he said, probably never even heard of many of them.\n\n\"Crackpot\" was a fighting word to O'Connor. But to Malone it had all\nthe sweetness of flattery. After all, he'd found telepaths in insane\nasylums, and teleports among the juvenile delinquents of New York.\n\"Crackpot\" was a word that was rapidly ceasing to have any meaning at\nall in Malone's mind.\n\nHe realized that he was still staring at the sock, which was black\nwith a gold clock. Hurriedly, he put it on, and finished dressing. He\nreached for the phone and made a few fast calls, and then teleported\nhimself to his locked office in FBI Headquarters, on East Sixty-ninth\nStreet in New York. He let himself out, and strolled down the\ncorridor. The agent-in-charge looked up from his desk as Malone\npassed, blinked, and said: \"Hello, Malone. What's up now?\"\n\n\"I'm going prowling,\" Malone said. \"But there won't be any work for\nyou, as far as I can see.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Just relax,\" Malone said. \"Breathe easy.\"\n\n\"I'll try to,\" the agent-in-charge said, a little sadly. \"But every\ntime you show up, I think about that wave of red Cadillacs you\nstarted. I'll never feel really secure again.\"\n\n\"Relax,\" Malone said. \"Next time it won't be Cadillacs. But it might\nbe spirits, blowing on ear-trumpets. Or whatever it is they do.\"\n\n\"Spirits, Malone?\" the agent-in-charge said.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Malone said sternly. \"I never drink on duty.\" He gave\nthe agent a cheery wave of his hand and went out to the street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Psychical Research Society had offices in the Ravell Building, a\nlarge structure composed mostly of plate glass and anodized aluminum\nthat looked just a little like a bright blue, partially transparent\ncrackerbox that had been stood on end for purposes unknown. Having\nwalked all the way down to this box on Fifty-sixth Street, Malone had\nrecovered his former sensitivity range to temperature and felt\npathetically grateful for the coolish sea breeze that made New York\nsomewhat less of an unbearable Summer Festival than was normal.\n\nThe lobby of the building was glittering and polished, as if human\nbeings could not possibly exist in it. Malone took an elevator to the\nsixth floor, stepped out into a small, equally polished hall, and\nhurriedly looked off to his right. A small door stood there, with a\nlegend engraved in elegantly small letters. It said:\n\n          _The Psychical Research Society_\n                      _Push_\n\nMalone obeyed instructions. The door swung noiselessly open, and then\nclosed behind him.\n\nHe was in a large square-looking room which had a couch and chair set\nat one corner, and a desk at the far end. Behind the desk was a brass\nplate, on which was engraved:\n\n            _The Psychical Research Society_\n                     _Main Offices_\n\nTo Malone's left was a hall that angled off into invisibility, and to\nthe left of the desk was another one, going straight back past doors\nand two radiators until it ran into a right-angled turn and also\ndisappeared.\n\nMalone took in the details of his surroundings almost automatically,\nfiling them in his memory just in case he ever needed to use them.\n\nOne detail, however, required more than automatic attention. Sitting\nbehind the desk, her head just below the brass plaque, was a redhead.\nShe was, Malone thought, positively beautiful. Of course, he could not\nsee the lower two-thirds of her body, but if they were half as\ninteresting as the upper third and the face and head, he was willing\nto spend days, weeks or even months on their investigation. Some jobs,\nhe told himself, feeling a strong sense of duty, were definitely worth\ntaking time over.\n\nShe was turned slightly away from Malone, and had obviously not heard\nhim come in. Malone wondered how best to announce himself, and\nregretfully gave up the idea of tiptoeing up to the girl, placing his\nhands over her eyes, kissing the back of her neck and crying:\n\"Surprise!\" It was elegant, he felt, but it just wasn't right.\n\nHe compromised at last on the old established method of\nthroat-clearing to attract her attention. He was sure he could take it\nfrom there, to an eminently satisfying conclusion.\n\nHe tiptoed on the deep-pile rug right up to her desk.\n\nAnd the expected happened.\n\nHe sneezed.\n\nThe sneeze was loud and long, and it echoed through the room and\nthroughout the corridors. It sounded to Malone like the blast of a\nsmall bomb, or possibly a grenade. Startled himself by the volume of\nsound he had managed to generate, he jumped back.\n\nThe girl had jumped, too--but her leap had been straight upward, about\nan inch and a half. She came down on her chair and reached up a hand.\nThe hand wiped the back of her neck with a slow, lingering motion of\ncomplete loathing. Then, equally slowly, she turned.\n\n\"That,\" she said in a low, sweet voice, \"was a dirty trick.\"\n\n\"It was an accident,\" Malone said.\n\nShe regarded Malone darkly. \"Do you always do that to strangers? Is it\nsome new sort of perversion?\"\n\n\"I have never done such a thing before,\" Malone said sternly.\n\n\"Oh,\" the girl said. \"An experimenter. Avid for new sensations.\nProbably a jaded scion of a rich New York family.\" She paused. \"Tell\nme,\" she said. \"Is it fun?\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He shut it, thought for\na second and then tried again. He got as far as: \"I--\" before Nemesis\novertook him. The second sneeze was even louder and more powerful than\nthe first had been.\n\n\"It must be fun,\" the girl said acidly, producing a handkerchief from\nsomewhere and going to work on her face. \"You just can't seem to wait\nto do it again. Would it do any good to tell you that the fascination\nwith this form of greeting is not universal? Or don't you care?\"\n\nMalone said, goaded, \"I've got a cold.\"\n\n\"And you feel you should share it with the world,\" the girl said. \"I\nquite understand. Tell me, is there anything I can do for you? Or has\nyour mission been accomplished?\"\n\n\"My mission?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Having sneezed twice at me,\" the girl said, \"do you now feel\nsatisfied? Will you vanish softly and silently away? Or do you want to\nsneeze at somebody else?\"\n\n\"I want the President of the Society,\" Malone said. \"According to my\ninformation, his name is Sir Lewis Carter.\"\n\n\"And if you sneeze at him,\" the girl said, \"yours is going to be mud.\nHe isn't much on novelty.\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Besides which,\" she said, \"he's extremely busy. And I don't think\nhe'll see you at all. Why don't you go and sneeze at somebody else?\nThere must be lots of people who would consider themselves honored to\nbe noticed, especially in such a startling way. Why don't you try and\nfind one somewhere? Somewhere very far away?\"\n\nMalone was beyond speech. He fumbled for his wallet, flipped it open\nand showed the girl his identification.\n\n\"My, my,\" she said. \"And hasn't the FBI anything better to do? I mean,\ncan't you go and sneeze at counterfeiters in their lairs, or wherever\nthey might be?\"\n\n\"I want to see Sir Lewis Carter,\" Malone said doggedly.\n\nThe girl shrugged and picked up the phone on her desk. It was a\nblank-vision device, of course; many office intercoms were. She\ndialed, waited and then said: \"Sir Lewis, please.\" Another second went\nby. Then she spoke again. \"Sir Lewis,\" she said, \"this is Lou, at the\nfront desk. There's a man here named Malone, who wants to see you.\"\n\nShe waited a second. \"I don't know what he wants,\" she told the phone.\n\"But he's from the FBI.\" A second's pause. \"That's right, the FBI,\"\nshe said. \"All right, Sir Lewis. Right away.\" She hung up the phone\nand turned to watch Malone warily.\n\n\"Sir Lewis,\" she said, \"will see you. I couldn't say why. But take the\nside corridor to the rear of the suite. His office has his name on it,\nand I won't tell you you can't miss it because I have every faith that\nyou will. Good luck.\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Look,\" he said. \"I know I startled you, but I didn't\nmean to. I--\" He started to sneeze, but this time he got his own\nhandkerchief out in time and muffled the explosion slightly.\n\n\"Good work,\" the girl said approvingly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was nothing at all to say to that remark, Malone reflected as he\nwended his way down the side corridor. It seemed endless, and kept\nbranching off unexpectedly. Once he blundered into a large open room\nfilled with people at desks. A woman who seemed to have a great many\nteeth and rather bulbous eyes looked up at him. \"Can I help you?\" she\nsaid in a fervent whine.\n\n\"I sincerely hope not,\" Malone said, backing away and managing to find\nthe corridor once more. After what seemed like a long time, and two\nmore sneezes, he found a small door which was labeled in capital\nletters:\n\n              THE PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\n                     SOCIETY\n                SIR LEWIS CARTER\n                   PRESIDENT\n\nMalone sighed. \"Well,\" he muttered, \"they certainly aren't hiding\nanything.\" He pushed at the door, and it swung open.\n\nSir Lewis was a tall, solidly-built man with a kindly expression. He\nwore gray flannel trousers and a brown tweed jacket, which made an\ninteresting color contrast with his iron-gray hair. His teeth were\nclenched so firmly on the bit of a calabash pipe with a meerschaum\nbowl that Malone wondered if he could ever get loose. Malone shut the\ndoor behind him, and Sir Lewis rose and extended a hand.\n\nMalone went to the desk and reached across to take the hand. It was\nfirm and dry. \"I'm Kenneth Malone,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Pleased to meet you; always happy, of\ncourse, to do whatever I can for your FBI. Not only a duty, so to\nspeak, but a pleasure. Sit down. Please do sit down.\"\n\nMalone found a chair at the side of the desk, and sank into it. It was\nsoft and comfortable. It provided such a contrast to O'Connor's\nfurnishings that Malone began to wish it was Sir Lewis who was\nemployed at Yucca Flats. Then he could tell Sir Lewis everything about\nthe case.\n\nNow, of course, he could only hedge and try to make do without stating\nvery many facts. \"Sir Lewis,\" he said, \"I trust you'll keep this\nconversation confidential.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Sir Lewis said. He removed the pipe, stared at it, and\nreplaced it.\n\n\"I can't give you the full details,\" Malone went on, \"but the FBI is\npresently engaged in an investigation which requires the specialized\nknowledge your organization seems to have.\"\n\n\"FBI?\" Sir Lewis said. \"Specialized investigation?\" He seemed pleased,\nbut a trifle puzzled. \"Dear boy, anything we have is at your disposal,\nof course. But I quite fail to see how you can consider us--\"\n\n\"It's rather an unusual problem,\" Malone said, feeling that that was\nthe understatement of the year. \"But I understand that your records go\nback nearly a century.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" Sir Lewis murmured.\n\n\"During that time,\" Malone said, \"the Society investigated a great\nmany supposedly supernatural or supernormal incidents.\"\n\n\"Many of them,\" Sir Lewis said, \"were discovered to be fraudulent, I'm\nafraid. The great majority, in fact.\"\n\n\"That's what I'd assume,\" Malone said. He fished in his pockets, found\na cigarette and lit it. Sir Lewis went on chewing at his unlit pipe.\n\"What we're interested in,\" Malone said, \"is some description of the\nvarious methods by which these frauds were perpetrated.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Sir Lewis said. \"The tricks of the trade, so to speak?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Sir Lewis said. \"The luminous gauze, for instance, that\npasses for ectoplasm; the various methods of table-lifting; control of\nthe ouija board--things like that?\"\n\n\"Not quite that elementary,\" Malone said. He puffed on the cigarette,\nwishing it was a cigar. \"We're pretty much up to that kind of thing.\nBut had it ever occurred to you that many of the methods used by phony\nmind-reading acts, for instance, might be used as communication\nmethods by spies?\"\n\n\"Why, I believe some have been,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Though I don't know\nmuch about that, of course; there was a case during the First World\nWar--\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said. He took a deep breath. \"It's things like that\nwe're interested in,\" he said, and spent the next twenty minutes\nslowly approaching his subject. Sir Lewis, apparently fascinated, was\nperfectly willing to unbend in any direction, and jotted down notes on\nsome of Malone's more interesting cases, murmuring: \"Most unusual,\nmost unusual,\" as he wrote.\n\nThe various types of phenomena that the Society had investigated came\ninto the discussion, and Malone heard quite a lot about the Beyond,\nthe Great Summerland, Spirit Mediums and the hypothetical existence of\nfairies, goblins and elves.\n\n\"But, Sir Lewis--\" he said.\n\n\"I make no claims personally,\" Sir Lewis said. \"But I understand that\nthere is a large and somewhat vocal group which does make rather\nsolid-sounding claims in that direction. They say that they have seen\nfairies, talked with goblins, danced with the elves.\"\n\n\"They must be very unusual people,\" Malone said, understating heavily.\n\n\"Oh,\" Sir Lewis said, \"without a that it goes through\nAccounting.\"\n\nTalk like this passed away nearly a half hour, until Malone finally\nfelt that it was the right time to introduce some of his real\nquestions. \"Tell me, Sir Lewis,\" he said, \"have you had many instances\nof a single man, or a small group of men, controlling the actions of a\nmuch larger group? And doing it in such a way that the larger group\ndoesn't even know it is being manipulated?\"\n\n\"Of course I have,\" Sir Lewis said. \"And so have you. They call it\nadvertising.\"\n\nMalone flicked his cigarette into an ashtray. \"I didn't mean exactly\nthat,\" he said. \"Suppose they're doing it in such a way that the\nlarger group doesn't even suspect that manipulation is going on?\"\n\nSir Lewis removed his pipe and frowned at it. \"I may be able to give\nyou a little information,\" he said slowly, \"but not much.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Malone said, trying to sound only mildly interested.\n\n\"Outside of mob psychology,\" Sir Lewis said, \"and all that sort of\nthing, I really haven't seen any record of a case of such a thing\nhappening. And I can't quite imagine anyone faking it.\"\n\n\"But you have got some information?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Sir Lewis said. \"There is always spirit control.\"\n\n\"Spirit control?\" Malone blinked.\n\n\"Demonic intervention,\" Sir Lewis said. \"'My name is Legion,' you\nknow.\"\n\nSir Lewis Legion, Malone thought confusedly, was a rather unusual\nname. He took a breath and caught hold of his revolving mind. \"How\nwould you go about that?\" he said, a little hopelessly.\n\n\"I haven't the foggiest,\" Sir Lewis admitted cheerfully. \"But I will\nhave it looked up for you.\" He made a note. \"Anything else?\"\n\nMalone tried to think. \"Yes,\" he said at last. \"Can you give me a\ncondensed report on what is known--and I mean _known_--on telepathy\nand teleportation?\"\n\n\"What you want,\" Sir Lewis said, \"are those cases proven genuine, not\nthe ones in which we have established fraud, or those still in doubt.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said. If he got no other use out of the data, it\nwould provide a measuring-stick for the Society. The general public\ndidn't know that the government was actually using psionic powers, and\nthe Society's theories, checked against actual fact, would provide a\nrough index of reliability to use on the Society's other data.\n\nBut spirits, somehow, didn't seem very likely. Malone sighed and stood\nup.\n\n\"I'll have copies made of all the relevant material,\" Sir Lewis said,\n\"from our library and research files. Where do you want the material\nsent? I do want to warn you of its bulk; there may be quite a lot of\nit.\"\n\n\"FBI Headquarters, on Sixty-ninth Street,\" Malone said. \"And send a\nstatement of expenses along with it. As long as the bill's within\nreason, don't worry about itemizing; I'll see that it goes through\nAccounting.\"\n\nSir Lewis nodded. \"Fine,\" he said. \"And, if you should have any\ndifficulties with the material, please let me know. I'll always be\nglad to help.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your co-operation,\" Malone said. He went to the door, and\nwalked on out.\n\nHe blundered back into the same big room again, on his way through the\ncorridors. The bulbous-eyed woman, who seemed to have inherited a full\nset of thirty-two teeth from each of her parents, gave him a friendly\nif somewhat crowded smile, but Malone pressed on without a word. After\na while, he found the reception room again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl behind the desk looked up. \"How did he react?\" she said.\n\nMalone blinked. \"React?\" he said.\n\n\"When you sneezed at him,\" she said. \"Because I've been thinking it\nover, and I've got a new theory. You're doing a survey on how people\nact when encountering sneezes. Like Kinsey.\"\n\nThis girl--Lou something, Malone thought, and with difficulty\nrefrained from adding \"Gehrig\"--had an unusual effect, he decided. He\nwondered if there were anyone in the world she couldn't reduce to\nparalyzed silence.\n\n\"Of course,\" she went on, \"Kinsey was dealing with sex, and you\naren't. At least, you aren't during business hours.\" She smiled\npolitely at Malone.\n\n\"No,\" he said helplessly, \"I'm not.\"\n\n\"It is sneezing, then,\" she said. \"Will I be in the book when it's\npublished?\"\n\n\"Book?\" Malone said, feeling more and more like a rather low-grade\nmoron.\n\n\"The book on sneezing, when you get it published,\" she said. \"I can\nsee it now--the Case of Miss X, a Receptionist.\"\n\n\"There isn't going to be any book,\" Malone said.\n\nShe shook her head. \"That's a shame,\" she said. \"I've always wanted to\nbe a Miss X. It sounds exciting.\"\n\n\"X,\" Malone said at random, \"marks the spot.\"\n\n\"Why, that's the sweetest thing that's been said to me all day,\" the\ngirl said. \"I thought you could hardly talk, and here you come out\nwith lovely things like that. But I'll bet you say it to all the\ngirls.\"\n\n\"I have never said it to anybody before,\" Malone said flatly. \"And I\nnever will again.\"\n\nThe girl sighed. \"I'll treasure it,\" she said. \"My one great moment.\nGood-by, Mr. ... Malone, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Ken,\" Malone said. \"Just call me Ken.\"\n\n\"And I'm Lou,\" the girl said. \"Good-by.\"\n\nAn elevator arrived and Malone ducked into it. Louie? he thought.\nLouise? Luke? Of course, there was Sir Lewis Carter, who might be\ncalled Lou. Was he related to the girl?\n\nNo, Malone thought wildly. Relations went by last names. There was no\nreason for Lou to be related to Sir Lewis. They didn't even look\nalike. For instance, he had no desire whatever to make a date with Sir\nLewis Carter, or to take him to a glittering nightclub. And the very\nidea of Sir Lewis Carter sitting on the Malone lap was enough to give\nhim indigestion and spots before the eyes.\n\nSternly, he told himself to get back to business. The elevator stopped\nat the lobby and he got out and started down the street, feeling that\nconsideration of the Lady Known As Lou was much more pleasant. After\nall, what did he have to work with, as far as his job was concerned?\n\nSo far, two experts had told him that his theory was full of lovely\nlittle holes. Worse than that, they had told him that mass control of\nhuman beings was impossible, as far as they knew.\n\nAnd maybe it was impossible, he told himself sadly. Maybe he should\njust junk his whole theory and think up a new one. Maybe there was no\npsionics involved in the thing at all, and Boyd and O'Connor were\nright.\n\nOf course, he had a deep-seated conviction that psionics was somewhere\nat the root of everything, but that didn't necessarily mean anything.\nA lot of people had deep-seated convictions that they were beetles, or\nthat the world was flat. And then again, murderers often suffered as a\nresult of deep-seated convictions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he had invented a whole new psionic\ntheory--or, at least, observed some new psionic facts. Maybe they\nwould call the results Maloneizing, instead of O'Connorizing. He tried\nto picture a man opening a door and saying: \"Come out quick--Mr.\nFrembits is Maloneizing again.\"\n\nIt didn't sound very plausible. But, after all, he did have a\ndeep-seated conviction. He tried to think of a shallow-seated\nconviction, and failed. Didn't convictions ever stand up, anyhow, or\nlie down?\n\nHe shook his head, discovered that he was on Sixty-ninth Street, and\nheaded for the FBI headquarters. His convictions, he had found, were\nsometimes an expression of his precognitive powers; he determined to\nride with them, at least for a while.\n\nBy the time he came to the office of the agent-in-charge, he had\nfigured out the beginnings of a new line of attack.\n\n\"How about the ghosts?\" the agent-in-charge asked as he passed.\n\n\"They'll be along,\" Malone said. \"In a big bundle, addressed to me\npersonally. And don't open the bundle.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the agent-in-charge asked.\n\n\"Because I don't want the things to get loose and run around saying\n_Boo!_ to everybody,\" Malone said brightly, and went on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe opened the door of his private office, went inside and sat down at\nthe desk there. He took his time about framing a thought, a single,\nclear, deliberate thought:\n\n_Your Majesty, I'd like to speak to you._\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe hardly had time to finish it. A flash of color appeared in the\nroom, just a few feet from his desk. The flash resolved itself into a\ntiny, grandmotherly-looking woman with a corona of white hair and a\nkindly, twinkling expression. She was dressed in the full court\ncostume of the First Elizabethan period, and this was hardly\nsurprising to Malone. The little old lady believed, quite firmly, that\nshe was Queen Elizabeth I, miraculously preserved over all these\ncenturies. Malone, himself, had practically forgotten that the woman's\nreal name was Rose Thompson, and that she had only been alive for\nsixty-five years or so. For most of that time, she had been insane.\n\nFor all of that time, however, she had been a genuine telepath. She\nhad been discovered during the course of Malone's first psionic case,\nand by now she had even learned to teleport by \"reading\" the process\nin Malone's mind.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Sir Kenneth,\" she said in a regal, kindly voice. She\nwas mad, he knew, but her delusion was nicely kept within bounds. All\nof her bright world hinged on the single fact that she was unshakably\ncertain of her royalty. As long as the FBI catered to that\nnotion--which included a Royal dwelling for her in Yucca Flats, and\nthe privilege of occasionally knighting FBI Agents who had pleased her\nunpredictable fancy--she was perfectly rational on all other points.\nShe co-operated with Dr. O'Connor and with the FBI in the\ninvestigation of her psionic powers, and she had given her Royal word\nnot to teleport except at Malone's personal request.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to you,\" Malone said, \"Your Majesty.\"\n\nThere was an odd note in the Queen's voice, and an odd, haunted\nexpression on her face. \"I've been hoping you'd ask me to come,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I had a hunch you were following me telepathically,\" Malone said.\n\"Can you give me any help?\"\n\n\"I ... I really don't know,\" she said. \"It's something new, and\nsomething ... disturbing. I've never come across anything like it\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"It's the--\" She made a gesture that conveyed nothing at all to\nMalone. \"The ... the static,\" she said at last.\n\nMalone blinked. \"Static?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"You're not telepathic, so I can't tell you what it's\nreally like. But ... well, Sir Kenneth, have you ever seen disturbance\non a TV screen, when there's some powerful electric output nearby? The\nbright, senseless snowstorms, the meaningless hash?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It's like that,\" she said. \"It's a ... a sudden, meaningless,\ndisturbing blare of telepathic energy.\"\n\nThe telephone rang once. Malone ignored it.\n\n\"What's causing these disturbances?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know, Sir Kenneth. I don't know,\" she\nsaid. \"I can't pick up a person's mind over a distance unless I know\nhim--and I can't see what's causing this at all. It's ... frankly, Sir\nKenneth, it's rather terrifying.\"\n\nThe phone rang again.\n\n\"How long have you been experiencing this disturbance?\" Malone asked.\nHe looked at the phone.\n\n\"The telephone isn't important,\" Her Majesty said. \"It's only Sir\nThomas, calling to tell you he's arrested three spies, and that\ndoesn't matter at all.\"\n\n\"It doesn't?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Her Majesty said. \"What does matter is that I've only\nbeen picking up these flashes since you were assigned to this new\ncase, Sir Kenneth. And--\" She paused.\n\n\"Well?\" Malone said.\n\n\"And they only appear,\" Her Majesty said, \"when I'm tuned to _your_\nmind!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nV\n\nMalone stared. He tried to say something but he couldn't find any\nwords. The telephone rang again and he pushed the switch with a sense\nof relief. The beard-fringed face of Thomas Boyd appeared on the\nscreen.\n\n\"You're getting hard to find,\" Boyd said. \"I think you're letting fame\nand fortune go to your head.\"\n\n\"I left word at the office that I was coming here,\" Malone said\naggrievedly.\n\n\"Sure you did,\" Boyd said. \"How do you think I found you? Am I\ntelepathic? Do I have strange powers?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't surprise me in the least,\" Malone said. \"Now, about those\nspies--\"\n\n\"See what I mean?\" Boyd said. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Just lucky, I guess,\" Malone murmured. \"But what about them?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"we picked up two men working in the Senate Office\nBuilding, and another one working for the State Department.\"\n\n\"And they are spies?\" Malone said. \"Real spies?\"\n\n\"Oh, they're real enough,\" Boyd said. \"We've known about 'em for\nyears, and I finally decided to pick them up for questioning. Maybe\nthey have something to do with all this mess that's bothering\neverybody.\"\n\n\"You haven't the faintest idea what you mean,\" Malone said. \"Mess is\nhardly the word.\"\n\nBoyd snorted. \"You go on getting yourself confused,\" he said, \"while\nsome of us do the real work. After all--\"\n\n\"Never mind the insults,\" Malone said. \"How about the spies?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, a trifle reluctantly, \"they've been working as\njanitors and maintenance men, and of course we've made sure they\nhaven't been able to get their hands on any really valuable\ninformation.\"\n\n\"So they've suddenly turned into criminal masterminds,\" Malone said.\n\"After being under careful surveillance for years--\"\n\n\"Well, it's possible,\" Boyd said defensively.\n\n\"Almost anything is possible,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Some things,\" Boyd said carefully, \"are more possible than others.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Charles W. Aristotle,\" Malone said. \"I hope you realize\nwhat you've done, picking up those three men. We might have been able\nto get some good lines on them, if you'd left them where they were.\"\n\nThere is an old story about a general who went on an inspection tour\nof the front during World War I, and, putting his head incautiously up\nout of a trench, was narrowly missed by a sniper's bullet. He turned\nto a nearby sergeant and bellowed: \"Get that sniper!\"\n\n\"Oh, we've got him spotted, sir,\" the sergeant said. \"He's been there\nfor six days now.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" the general said, \"why don't you blast him out of\nthere?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it's this way,\" the sergeant explained. \"He's fired about\nsixty rounds since he's been out there, and he hasn't hit anything\nyet. We're afraid if we get rid of him they'll put up somebody who\n_can_ shoot.\"\n\nThis was standard FBI policy when dealing with minor spies. A great\nmany had been spotted, including four in the Department of Fisheries.\nBut known spies are easier to keep track of than unknown ones. And, as\nlong as they're allowed to think they haven't been spotted, they may\nlead the way to other spies or spy networks.\n\n\"I thought it was worth the risk,\" Boyd said. \"After all, if they have\nsomething to do with the case--\"\n\n\"But they don't,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd exploded, \"Let me find out for myself, will you? You're spoiling\nall the fun.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" Malone said, \"they don't.\"\n\n\"You can't afford to take any chances,\" Boyd said. \"After all, when I\nthink about William Logan, I tell myself we'd better take care of\nevery lead.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said finally, \"you may be right. And then again, you\nmay be normally wrong.\"\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"How should I know?\" Malone said \"I'm too busy to go around and around\nlike this. But since you've picked up the spies, I suppose it won't do\nany harm to find out if they know anything.\"\n\nBoyd snorted again. \"Thank you,\" he said, \"for your kind permission.\"\n\n\"I'll be right down,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll be waiting,\" Boyd said. \"In Interrogation Room 7. You'll\nrecognize me by the bullet hole in my forehead and the strange South\nAmerican poison, hitherto unknown to science, in my oesophagus.\"\n\n\"Very funny,\" Malone said. \"Don't give up the ship.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoyd switched off without a word. Malone shrugged at the blank screen\nand pushed his own switch. Then he turned slowly back to Her Majesty,\nwho was standing, waiting patiently, at the opposite side of the desk.\nInterference, he thought, located around him--\n\n\"Why, yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I did say.\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, \"would you mind terribly if I\nasked you questions before you answered them? I know you can see them\nin my mind, but it's simpler for me to do things the normal way, just\nnow.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said sincerely. \"I do agree that matters are confused\nenough already. Please go on.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" Malone said. \"Well, then. Do you mean that\n_I'm_ the one causing all this ... mental static?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"Not at all. It's definitely coming from somewhere\nelse, and it's beamed at you, or beamed around you.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"It's just that I can only pick it up when I'm tuned to your mind,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Like now?\" Malone said.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Right now,\" she said, \"there isn't any. It only\nhappens every once in a while--every so often, and not continuously.\"\n\n\"Does it happen at regular intervals?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not as far as I've been able to tell,\" Her Majesty said. \"It just ...\nhappens, that's all. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to\nit. Except that it did start when you were assigned to this case.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" Malone said. \"And what is it supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Interference,\" she said. \"Static. Jumble. That's all it means. I just\ndon't know any more than that, Sir Kenneth; I've never experienced\nanything like it in my life. It really does disturb me.\"\n\nThat, Malone told himself, he could believe. It must be an experience,\nhe told himself, like having someone you were looking at suddenly\ndissolve into a jumble of meaningless shapes and lights.\n\n\"That's a very good analogy,\" Her Majesty said. \"If you'll pardon me\nspeaking before you've voiced your thought--\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"Go right ahead.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Her Majesty said. \"The analogy you use is a good one.\nIt's just as disturbing and as meaningless as that.\"\n\n\"And you don't know what's causing it?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said.\n\n\"Nor what the purpose of it is?\" he said.\n\nHer Majesty shook her head slowly. \"Sir Kenneth,\" she said, \"I don't\neven know whether or not there _is_ any purpose.\"\n\nMalone sighed deeply. Nothing in the case seemed to make any sense. It\nwasn't that there were no clues, or no information for him to work\nwith. There were a lot of clues, and there was a lot of information.\nBut nothing seemed to link up with anything else. Every new fact was a\nbright, shiny arrow pointing nowhere in particular.\n\n\"Well, then--\" he started.\n\nThe intercom buzzed. Malone jabbed ferociously at the button. \"Yes,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"The ghosts are here,\" the agent-in-charge's voice said.\n\nMalone blinked. \"What?\" he said.\n\n\"You said you were going to get some ghosts,\" the agent-in-charge\nsaid. \"From the Psychical Research Society, in a couple of large\nbundles And they're here now. Want me to exorcise 'em for you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said wearily. \"Just send them in to join the crowd. Got\na messenger?\"\n\n\"I'll send them down,\" the agent-in-charge said. \"About one minute.\"\n\nMalone nodded, realized the man couldn't see him, said: \"Fine,\" and\nswitched off. He looked at his watch. A little over half an hour had\npassed since he had left the Psychical Research Society offices. That,\nhe told himself, was efficiency.\n\nNot that the books would mean anything, he thought. They would just\ntake their places at the end of the long row of meaningless,\ndisturbing, vicious facts that cluttered up his mind. He wasn't an FBI\nagent any more; he was a clown and a failure, and he was through. He\nwas going to resign and go to South Dakota and live the life of a\nhermit. He would drink goat's milk and eat old shoes or something, and\nwhenever another human being came near he would run away and hide.\nThey would call him Old Kenneth, and people would write articles for\nmagazines about The Twentieth Century Hermit.\n\nAnd that would make him famous, he thought wearily, and the whole\ncircle would start all over again.\n\n\"Now, now, Sir Kenneth,\" Queen Elizabeth said. \"Things aren't quite\nthat bad.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they are,\" Malone said. \"They're even worse.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we can find an answer to all your questions,\" Her Majesty\nsaid.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Even I can find an answer. But it isn't the\nright one.\"\n\n\"You can?\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"My answer is: To Hell with everything.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone's Washington offices didn't look any different. He sighed and\nput the two big packages from the Psychical Research Society down on\nhis desk, and then turned to Her Majesty.\n\n\"I wanted you to teleport along with me,\" he said, \"because I need\nyour help.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I know.\"\n\nHe blinked. \"Oh. Sure you do. But let me go over the details.\"\n\nHer Majesty waved a gracious hand. \"If you like, Sir Kenneth,\" she\nsaid.\n\nMalone nodded. \"We're going on down to Interrogation Room 7 now,\" he\nsaid. \"Next door to it, there's an observation room, with a one-way\npanel in the wall. You'll be able to see us, but we won't be able to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"I really don't require an observation panel,\" Her Majesty said. \"If I\nenter your mind, I can see through your eyes--\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Malone said. \"But the observation room was built for more\nnormal people--saving your presence, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said.\n\n\"Now,\" Malone went on, \"I want you to watch all three of the men we're\ngoing to bring in, and dig everything you can out of their minds.\"\n\n\"Everything?\" she said.\n\n\"We don't know what might be useful,\" Malone said. \"Anything you can\nfind. And if you want any questions asked--if there's anything you\nthink I ought to ask the men, or say to them--there's a nonvision\nphone in the observation room. Just lift the receiver. That\nautomatically rings the one in the Interrogation Room and I'll pick it\nup. Understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Sir Kenneth,\" she said.\n\n\"O.K., then,\" Malone said. \"Let's go.\" They headed for the door.\nMalone stopped as he opened it. \"And by the way,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"If you get any more of those--disturbances, let me know.\"\n\n\"At once,\" Her Majesty promised.\n\nThey went on down the hall and took the elevator down to Interrogation\nRoom 7, on the lowest level. There was no particular reason for\nputting the Interrogation section down there, except that it tended to\nmake prisoners more nervous. And a nervous prisoner, Malone knew, was\nvery possibly a confessing prisoner.\n\nMalone ushered Her Majesty through the unmarked door of the\nobservation chamber, made sure that the panel and phone were in\nworking order, and went out. He stepped into Interrogation Room 7\ntrying hard to look bored, businesslike and unbeatable. Boyd and four\nother agents were already there, all standing around and talking\ndesultorily in low tones. None of them looked as if they had ever had\na moment's worry in their lives. It was all part of the same\ntechnique, of course, Malone thought. Make the prisoner feel\nresistance is useless, and you've practically got him working for you.\n\nThe prisoner was a hulking, flabby fat man in work coveralls. He had\nblack hair that spilled all over his forehead, and tiny button eyes.\nHe was the only man in the room who was sitting down, and that was\nmeant to make him feel even more inferior and insecure. His hands were\nclasped fatly in his lap, and he was staring down at them in a\nregretful manner. None of the FBI agents paid the slightest attention\nto him. The general impression was that something really tough was\ncoming up, but that they were in no hurry for it. They were willing to\nwait for the Third Degree, it seemed, until the blacksmith had done a\nreally good job with the new spikes for the Iron Maiden.\n\nThe prisoner looked up apprehensively as Malone shut the door. Malone\npaid no attention to him, and the prisoner unclasped his hands, rubbed\nthem on his coveralls and then reclasped them in his lap. His eyes\nfell again.\n\nBoyd looked up, too. \"Hello, Ken,\" he said. He tapped a sheaf of\npapers on the single table in the room. Malone went over and picked\nthem up.\n\nThey were the abbreviated condensations of three dossiers. All three\nof the men covered in the dossiers were naturalized citizens, but all\nhad come in us \"political refugees\"--from Hungary, from\nCzechoslovakia, and from East Germany. Further checking had turned up\nthe fact that all three were actually Russians. They had been using\nfalse names during their stay in the United States, but their real\nones were appended to the dossiers.\n\nThe fat one in the Interrogation Room was named Alexis Brubitsch. The\nother two, who were presumably waiting separately in other rooms, were\nIvan Borbitsch and Vasili Garbitsch. The collection sounded, to\nMalone, like a seedy musical-comedy firm of lawyers: Brubitsch,\nBorbitsch and Garbitsch. He could picture them dancing gaily across a\nstage while the strains of music followed them, waving legal forms and\ntelephones and singing away.\n\nBrubitsch did not, however, look very gay. Malone went over to him\nnow, walking slowly, and looked down. Boyd came and stood next to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This is the one who won't talk, eh?\" Malone said, wondering if he\nsounded as much like Dick Tracy as he thought he did. It was a\nstandard opening, meant to make the prisoner think his fellows had\nalready confessed.\n\n\"That's him,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" Malone said, trying to look as if he were deciding between\nthe rack and the boiling oil. Brubitsch fidgeted slightly, but he\ndidn't say anything.\n\n\"We didn't know whether we had to get this one to talk, too,\" Boyd\nsaid. \"What with the others, and all. But we did think you ought to\nhave a look at him.\" He sounded very bored. It was obvious from his\ntone that the FBI didn't care in the least if Alexis Brubitsch never\nopened his mouth again, in what was likely to be a very short\nlifetime.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, equally bored, \"we might be able to get a few\ncorroborative details.\"\n\nBrubitsch swallowed hard. Malone ignored him.\n\n\"Now, just look at him,\" Boyd said. \"He certainly doesn't _look_ like\nthe head of a spy ring, does he?\"\n\n\"Of course he doesn't,\" Malone said. \"That's probably why the Russians\nused him. They figured nobody would ever look twice at a fat slob like\nthis. Nobody would ever suspect him of being the head man.\"\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" Boyd said. He yawned, which Malone thought was\noveracting a trifle. Brubitsch saw the yawn, and one hand came up to\njerk at his collar.\n\n\"Who'd ever think,\" Malone said, \"that he plotted those killings in\nRedstone--all three of them?\"\n\n\"It is surprising,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"But, then,\" Malone said, \"we know he did. There isn't any doubt of\nthat.\"\n\nBrubitsch seemed to be turning a pale green. It was a fascinating\ncolor, unlike any other Malone had ever seen. He watched it with\ninterest.\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Boyd said. \"We've got enough evidence from the other two\nto send this one to the chair tomorrow, if we want to.\"\n\n\"More than enough,\" Malone agreed.\n\nBrubitsch opened his mouth, shut it again and closed his eyes. His\nlips moved silently.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Boyd said conversationally, leaning down to the fat man,\n\"Did your orders on that job come from Moscow, or did you mastermind\nit all by yourself?\"\n\nBrubitsch's eyes stirred, then snapped open as if they'd been pulled\nby a string. \"Me?\" he said in a hoarse bass voice. \"I know nothing\nabout this murder. What murder?\"\n\nThere were no such murders, of course. But Malone was not ready to let\nBrubitsch know anything about that. \"Oh, the ones you shot in\nRedstone,\" he said in an offhand way.\n\n\"The what?\" Brubitsch said. \"I shot people? Never.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure you did,\" Boyd said. \"The others say you did.\"\n\nBrubitsch's head seemed to sink into his neck. \"Borbitsch and\nGarbitsch, they tell you about a murder? It is not true. Is a lie.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said. \"We think it's true.\"\n\n\"Is a lie,\" Brubitsch said, his little eyes peering anxiously from\nside to side. \"Is not true,\" he went on hopefully. \"I have alibi.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Boyd said. \"For what time?\"\n\n\"For time when murder happened,\" Brubitsch said. \"I was some place\nelse.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said, \"how do you know when the murders were\ndone? They were kept out of the newspapers.\" That, he reflected, was\nquite true, since the murders had never happened. But he watched\nBrubitsch with a wary eye.\n\n\"I know nothing about time,\" Brubitsch said, jerking at his collar. \"I\ndon't know when they happened.\"\n\n\"Then how can you have an alibi?\" Boyd snapped.\n\n\"Because I didn't do them!\" Brubitsch said tearfully. \"If I didn't,\nthen I _must_ have alibi!\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Malone said. \"Now, about these murders--\"\n\n\"Was no murder, not by me,\" Brubitsch said firmly. \"Was never any\nkilling of anybody, not even by accident.\"\n\n\"But your two friends say--\" Boyd began.\n\n\"My two friends are not my friends,\" Brubitsch said firmly. \"If they\ntell you about murder and say it was me, they are no friends. I did\nnot murder anybody. I have alibi. I did not even murder anybody a\nlittle bit. They are no friends. This is terrible.\"\n\n\"There,\" Malone said reflectively, \"I agree with you. It's positively\nawful. And I think we might as well give it up. After all, we don't\nneed your testimony. The other two are enough; they'll get maybe ten\nyears apiece, but you're going to get the chair.\"\n\n\"I will not sit down,\" Brubitsch said firmly. \"I am innocent. I am\ninnocent like a small child. Does a small child commit a murder? It is\nridiculous.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoyd picked up his cue with ease. \"You might as well give us your side\nof the story, then,\" he said easily. \"If you didn't commit any\nmurders--\"\n\n\"I am a small child,\" Brubitsch announced.\n\n\"O.K.,\" Boyd said. \"But if you didn't commit any murders, just what\n_have_ you been doing since you've been in this country as a Soviet\nagent?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I will say nothing,\" Brubitsch announced. \"I am a small child. It is\nenough.\" He paused, blinked, and went on: \"I will only tell you this:\nno murders were done by our group in any of our activities.\"\n\n\"And what were your activities?\"\n\n\"Oh, many things,\" Brubitsch said. \"Many, many things. We--\"\n\nThe telephone rang loudly, and Malone scooped it up with a practiced\nhand. \"Malone here,\" he said.\n\nHer Majesty's voice was excited. \"Sir Kenneth!\" she said. \"I just got\na tremendous burst of--static!\"\n\nMalone blinked. _Is my mind acting up again?_ he thought, knowing she\nwould pick it up. _Am I being interfered with?_\n\nHe didn't feel any different. But then, how was he supposed to feel?\n\n\"It's not _your_ mind, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"Not this time.\nIt's _his_ mind. That sneaky-thinking Brubitsch fellow.\"\n\n_Brubitsch?_ Malone thought. _Now what is that supposed to mean?_\n\n\"I don't know, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"But get on back to\nyour questioning. He's ready to talk now.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said aloud. \"Fine.\" He hung up and looked back to the\nRussian sitting on his chair. Brubitsch was ready to talk, and that\nwas one good thing, anyhow. But what was all the static about?\n\nWhat was going on?\n\n\"Now, then,\" Malone said. \"You were telling us about your group\nactivities.\"\n\n\"True,\" Brubitsch said. \"I did not commit any murders. It is possible\nthat Borbitsch committed murders. It is possible that Garbitsch\ncommitted murders. But I do not think so.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"They are my friends,\" Brubitsch said. \"Even if they tell lies. They\nare also small children. Besides, I am not even the head of the\ngroup.\"\n\n\"Who is?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Garbitsch,\" Brubitsch said instantly. \"He worked in the State\nDepartment, and he told us what to look for in the Senate Office\nBuilding.\"\n\n\"What were you supposed to look for?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"For information,\" Brubitsch said. \"For scraps of paper, or things we\noverheard. But it was very bad, very bad.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, bad?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Everything was terrible,\" Brubitsch said mournfully. \"Sometimes\nBorbitsch heard something and forgot to tell Garbitsch about it.\nGarbitsch did not like this. He is a very inflamed person. Once he\nthreatened to send Borbitsch to the island of Yap as a spy. That is a\nvery bad place to go to. There are no enjoyments on the island of Yap,\nand no one likes strangers there.\"\n\n\"What did you do with your information?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"We remembered it,\" Brubitsch said. \"Or, if we had a scrap of paper,\nwe saved it for Garbitsch and gave it to him. But I remember once that\nI had some paper. It had a formula on it. I do not know what the\nformula said.\"\n\n\"What was it about?\" Malone said.\n\nBrubitsch gave a massive shrug. \"It was about an X and some numbers,\"\nhe said. \"It was not very interesting, but it was a formula, and\nGarbitsch would have liked it. Unfortunately, I did not give it to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I am ashamed,\" Brubitsch said, looking ashamed. \"I was lighting a\ncigarette in the afternoon, when I had the formula. It is a very\nrelaxing thing to smoke a cigarette in the afternoon. It is soothing\nto the soul.\" He looked very sad. \"I was holding the piece of paper in\none hand,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the match and the paper came into\ncontact. I burned my finger. Here.\" He stuck out a finger toward\nMalone and Boyd, who looked at it without much interest for a second.\n\"The paper is gone,\" he said. \"Don't tell Garbitsch. He is very\ninflamed.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"But you remember the formula,\" he said. \"Don't you?\"\n\nBrubitsch shook his massive head very slowly. \"It was not very\ninteresting,\" he said. \"And I do not have a mathematical mind.\"\n\n\"We know,\" Malone said, \"You are a small child.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was terrible,\" Brubitsch said. \"Garbitsch was not happy about our\nactivities.\"\n\n\"What did Garbitsch do with the information?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"He passed it on,\" Brubitsch said. \"Every week he would send a\nshort-wave message to the homeland, in code. Some weeks he did not\nsend the message.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The radio did not work,\" Brubitsch said simply. \"We received orders\nby short-wave, but sometimes we did not receive the orders. The radio\nwas of very poor quality, and some weeks it refused to send any\nmessages. On other weeks, it refused to receive any messages.\"\n\n\"Who was your contact in Russia?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"A man named X,\" Brubitsch said. \"Like in the formula.\"\n\n\"But what was his real name?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Who knows?\" Brubitsch said.\n\n\"What else did you do?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"We met twice a week,\" Brubitsch said. \"Sometimes in Garbitsch's home,\nsometimes in other places. Sometimes we had information. At other\ntimes, we were friends, having a social gathering.\"\n\n\"Friends?\" Malone said.\n\nBrubitsch nodded. \"We drank together, talked, played chess. Garbitsch\nis the best chess player in the group. I am not very good. But once we\nhad some trouble.\" He paused. \"We had been drinking Russian liquors.\nThey are very strong. We decided to uphold the honor of our country.\"\n\n\"I think,\" Malone murmured sadly, \"I know what's coming.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Brubitsch said, interested. \"At any rate, we decided to honor\nour country in song. And a policeman came and talked to us. He took us\ndown to the police station.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"He was suspicious,\" Brubitsch said. \"We were singing the\n_Internationale_, and he was suspicious. It is unreasonable.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Boyd said. \"What happened then?\"\n\n\"He took us to the police station,\" Brubitsch said, \"and then after a\nlittle while he let us go. I do not understand this.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" Malone said. \"I do.\" He drew Boyd aside for a\nsecond, and whispered to him: \"The cops were ready to charge these\nthree clowns with everything in the book. We had a time springing them\nso we could go on watching them. I remember the stir-up, though I\nnever did know their names until now.\"\n\nBoyd nodded, and they returned to Brubitsch, who was staring up at\nthem with surly eyes.\n\n\"It is a secret you are telling him,\" Brubitsch said. \"That is not\nright.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, it's not right?\" Malone said.\n\n\"It is wrong,\" Brubitsch went on. \"It is not the American way.\"\n\nHe went on, with some prodding, to tell about the activities of the\nspy ring. It did not seem to be a very efficient spy ring; Brubitsch's\nlong sad tale of forgotten messages, mixed orders, misplaced documents\nand strange mishaps was a marvel and a revelation to the listening\nofficers.\n\n\"I've never heard anything like it,\" one of them whispered in a tone\nof absolute wonder. \"They're almost working on our side.\"\n\nOver an hour later, Malone turned wearily away from the prisoner. \"All\nright, Brubitsch,\" he said. \"I guess that pretty much covers things\nfor the moment. If we want any more information, though--\"\n\n\"Call on me,\" Brubitsch said sadly. \"I am not going any place. And I\nwill give you all the information you desire. But I did not commit any\nmurders--\"\n\n\"Good-bye, small child,\" Malone said, as two agents led the fat man\naway. The other two left soon afterward, and Malone and Boyd were\nalone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Think he was telling the truth?\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"Nobody,\" he said, \"could make up a story like that.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Boyd said, and the phone rang. Malone picked it up.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"He was telling the truth, all right,\" Her Majesty said. \"There are a\nfew more details, of course--there was a girl Brubitsch was involved\nwith, Sir Kenneth. But she doesn't seem to have anything to do with\nthe spy ring, and besides, she isn't a very nice person. She always\nwants money.\"\n\n\"Sounds perfectly lovely,\" Malone said. \"As a matter of fact, I think\nI know her. I know a lot of girls who always want money.\"\n\n\"You don't know this one, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, \"and\nbesides, she wouldn't be a good influence on you.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"How about the static explosions?\" he said. \"Pick up\nany more?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Just that one.\"\n\nMalone nodded at the receiver. \"All right,\" he said. \"We're going to\nbring in the second one now. Keep up the good work.\"\n\nHe hung up.\n\n\"Who've you got in the Observation Room?\" Boyd asked.\n\n\"Queen Elizabeth I,\" Malone said. \"Her Royal Majesty.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Boyd said without surprise. \"Well, was Brubitsch telling the\ntruth?\"\n\n\"He wasn't holding back anything important,\" Malone said, thinking\nabout the girl. It would be nice to meet a bad influence, he thought\nmournfully. It would be nice to go somewhere with a bad influence--a\nbad influence, he amended, with a good figure--and forget all about\nhis job, about the spies, about telepathy, teleportation, psionics and\neverything else. It might be restful.\n\nUnfortunately, it was impossible.\n\n\"What's this business about a static explosion?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Don't ask silly questions,\" Malone said. \"A static explosion is a\ncontradiction in terms. If something is static, it doesn't move--and\nwhoever heard of a motionless explosion?\"\n\n\"If it is a contradiction in terms,\" Boyd said, \"they're your terms.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But I don't know what they mean. I don't even\nknow what I mean.\"\n\n\"You're in a bad way,\" Boyd said, looking sympathetic.\n\n\"I'm in a perfectly terrible way,\" Malone said, \"and it's going to get\nworse. You wait and see.\"\n\n\"Of course I'll wait and see,\" Boyd said. \"I wouldn't miss the end of\nthe world for anything. It ought to be a great spectacle.\" He paused.\n\"Want them to bring in the next one?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"What have we got to lose but our minds? And who\nis the next one?\"\n\n\"Borbitsch,\" Boyd said. \"They're saving Garbitsch for a big finish.\"\n\nMalone nodded wearily. \"Onward,\" he said, and picked up the phone. He\npunched a number, spoke a few words and hung up.\n\nA minute later, the four FBI agents came back, leading a man. This one\nwas tall and thin, with the expression of a gloomy, degenerate and\nslightly nauseated bloodhound. He was led to the chair and he sat down\nin it as if he expected the worst to start happening at once.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said in a bored, tired voice. \"So this is the one who\nwon't talk.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nMidnight.\n\nKenneth J. Malone sat at his desk, in his Washington office,\nsurrounded by piles of papers covering the desk, spilling off onto the\nfloor and decorating his lap. He was staring at the papers as if he\nexpected them to leap up, dance round him and shout the solution to\nall his problems at him in trained choral voices. They did nothing at\nall.\n\nSeated cross-legged on the rug in the center of the room, and looking\nlike an impossible combination of the last Henry Tudor and Gautama\nBuddha, Thomas Boyd did nothing either. He was staring downward, his\nhands folded on his ample lap, wearing an expression of utter, burning\nfrustration. And on a nearby chair sat the third member of the\ncompany, wearing the calm and patient expression of the gently born\nunder all vicissitudes: Queen Elizabeth I.\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said into the silence. \"Now let's see what we've\ngot.\"\n\n\"I think we've got cerebral paresis,\" Boyd said. \"It's been coming on\nfor years.\"\n\n\"Don't be funny,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd gave a short, mirthless bark. \"Funny?\" he said. \"I'm absolutely\nhysterical with joy and good humor. I'm out of my mind with\nhappiness.\" He paused. \"Anyway,\" he finished, \"I'm out of my mind.\nWhich puts me in good company. The entire FBI, Brubitsch, Borbitsch,\nGarbitsch, Dr. Thomas O'Connor and Sir Lewis Carter--we're all out of\nour minds. If we weren't, we'd all move away to the Moon.\"\n\n\"And drink to forget,\" Malone added. \"Sure. But let's try and get some\nwork done.\"\n\n\"By all means, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. Boyd had not included\nher in his list of insane people, and she looked slightly miffed. It\nwas hard for Malone to tell whether she was miffed by the mention of\ninsanity, or at being left out.\n\n\"Let's review the facts,\" Malone said. \"This whole thing started with\nsome inefficiency in Congress.\"\n\n\"And some upheavals elsewhere.\" Boyd said. \"Labor unions, gangster\norganizations--\"\n\n\"Just about all over,\" Malone said. \"And though we've found three\nspies, it seems pretty obvious that they aren't causing this.\"\n\n\"They aren't causing much of anything,\" Boyd said. \"Except a lot of\nunbelieving laughter farther up the FBI line. I don't think anybody is\ngoing to believe our reports of those interviews.\"\n\n\"But they're true,\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"Sure they're true,\" Boyd said. \"That's the unbelievable part. They\nread like farce--and not very good farce at that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Malone said. \"I think they're pretty funny.\"\n\n\"Shall we get back to the business at hand?\" Her Majesty said gently.\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, it isn't the spies. And what we now have\nis confusion even worse compounded.\"\n\n\"Confounded,\" Boyd said. \"John Milton. 'Paradise Lost.' I heard it\nsomewhere....\"\n\n\"I don't mean confounded,\" Malone said. \"I mean confusion. Anyhow, the\nRussian espionage rings in this country seem to be in as bad a state\nas the Congress, the labor unions, the Syndicates, and all the rest.\nAnd all of them seem to have some sort of weird tie-in to these\nflashes of telepathic interference. Right, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"I ... believe so, Sir Kenneth,\" she said. The old woman looked tired\nand confused. Somehow, a lot of the brightness seemed to have gone out\nof her life. \"That's right,\" she said. \"I didn't realize there was so\nmuch of it going on. You see, Sir Kenneth, you're the only one I can\npick up at a distance who has been having these flashes. But now that\nI'm here in Washington, I can feel it going on all around me.\"\n\n\"It may not have anything to do with everything else,\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"If it doesn't,\" he said, \"it's the weirdest\ncoincidence I've ever even dreamed about, and my dreams can be pretty\nstrange. No, it's got to be tied in. There's some kind of mental\nstatic that is somehow making all these people goof up.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Boyd said. \"What is it being done for? Just fun?\"\n\n\"God only knows,\" Malone said. \"But we're going to have to find out.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" Boyd said, \"I suggest lots and lots of prayers.\"\n\nHer Majesty looked up. \"That's a fine idea,\" she said.\n\n\"But God helps those,\" Malone said, \"who help themselves. And we're\ngoing to help ourselves. Mostly with facts.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Boyd said. \"So far, all the facts have been a great\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Well, here's one,\" Malone said. \"We got one flash each from\nBrubitsch, Borbitsch and Garbitsch while we were questioning them.\nAnd in each case, that flash occurred just before they started to blab\neverything they knew. Before the flash, they weren't talking. They\nwere behaving just like good spies and keeping their mouths shut.\nAfter the flash, they couldn't talk fast enough.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Boyd said reflectively. \"They did seem to give up\npretty fast, even for amateurs.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"So the question is this,\" he said. \"Just what happens\nduring those crazy bursts of static?\"\n\nHe looked expectantly at Her Majesty, but she shook her head sadly. \"I\ndon't know,\" she said. \"I simply don't know. It's just noise to\nme--meaningless noise.\" She put her hands slowly over her face.\n\"People shouldn't do things like that to their Sovereign,\" she said in\na muffled voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone got up and went over to her. She wasn't crying, but she wasn't\nfar from it. He put an arm around her thin shoulders. \"Now, look, Your\nMajesty,\" he said in gentle tones, \"this will all clear up. We'll find\nout what's going on, and we'll find a way to put a stop to it.\"\n\n\"Sure we will,\" Boyd said. \"After all, Your Majesty, Sir Kenneth and I\nwill work hard on this.\"\n\n\"And the Queen's Own FBI,\" Malone said, \"won't stop until we've\nfinished with this whole affair, once and for all.\"\n\nHer Majesty brought her hands down from her face, very slowly. She was\nforcing a smile, but it didn't look too well. \"I know you won't fail\nyour Queen,\" she said. \"You two have always been the most loyal of my\nsubjects.\"\n\n\"We'll work hard,\" Malone said. \"No matter how long it takes.\"\n\n\"Because, after all,\" Boyd said in a musing, thoughtful tone, \"it is a\nserious crime, you know.\"\n\nThe words seemed to have an effect on Her Majesty, like a tonic. For a\nsecond her face wore an expression of Royal anger and indignance, and\nthe accustomed strength flowed back into her aged voice. \"You're quite\ncorrect, Sir Thomas!\" she said. \"The security of the Throne and the\nCrown are at stake!\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"What?\" he said. \"Are you two talking about something?\nWhat crime is this?\"\n\n\"An extremely serious one,\" Boyd said in a grave voice. He rose\nunsteadily to his feet, planted them firmly on the carpet, and\nfrowned.\n\n\"Go on,\" Malone said, fascinated. Her Majesty was watching Boyd with\nan intent expression.\n\n\"The crime,\" Boyd said, \"the very serious crime involved, is that of\nThreatening the Welfare of the Queen. The criminal has committed the\ncrime of Causing the Said Sovereign, Baselessly, Reasonlessly and\nWithout Consent or Let, to Be in a State of Apprehension for Her Life\nor Her Well-Being. And this crime--\"\n\n\"Aha,\" Malone said. \"I've got it. The crime is--\"\n\n\"High treason,\" Boyd intoned.\n\n\"High treason,\" Her Majesty said with satisfaction and fire in her\nvoice.\n\n\"Very high treason,\" Malone said. \"Extremely high.\"\n\n\"Stratospheric,\" Boyd agreed. \"That is, of course,\" he added, \"if the\nperpetrators of this dastardly crime are Her Majesty's subjects.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" the Queen said. \"I never thought of that. Suppose\nthey're not?\"\n\n\"Then,\" Malone said in his most vibrant voice, \"it is an Act of War.\"\n\n\"Steps,\" Boyd said, \"must be taken.\"\n\n\"We must do our utmost,\" Malone said. \"Sir Thomas--\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Kenneth?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"This task requires our most fervent dedication,\" Malone said. \"Please\ncome with me.\"\n\nHe went to the desk. Boyd followed him, walking straight-backed and\ntall. Malone bent and removed from a drawer of the desk a bottle of\nbourbon. He closed the drawer, poured some bourbon into two handy\nwater glasses from the desk, and capped the bottle. He handed one of\nthe water glasses to Boyd, and raised the other one aloft.\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" Malone said, \"I give you--Her Majesty, the Queen!\"\n\n\"To the Queen!\" Boyd echoed.\n\nThey downed their drinks and turned, as one man, to hurl the glasses\ninto the wastebasket.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn thinking it over later, Malone realized that he hadn't considered\nanything about that moment silly at all. Of course, an outsider might\nhave been slightly surprised at the sequence of events, but Malone was\nno outsider. And, after all, it was the proper way to treat a Queen,\nwasn't it?\n\nAnd--\n\nWhen Malone had first met Her Majesty, he had wondered why, although\nshe could obviously read minds, and so knew perfectly well that\nneither Malone nor Boyd believed she was Queen Elizabeth I, she\ninsisted on an outward show of respect and dedication. He'd asked her\nabout it at last, and her reply had been simple, reasonable and to the\npoint.\n\nAccording to her--and Malone didn't doubt it for an instant--most\npeople simply didn't think their superiors were all they claimed to\nbe. But they acted as if they did--at least while in the presence of\nthose superiors. It was a common fiction, a sort of handy oil on the\nwheels of social intercourse.\n\nAnd all Her Majesty had ever insisted on was the same sort of\ntreatment.\n\n\"Bless you,\" she'd said, \"I can't help the way you _think_, but, as\nQueen, I do have some control over the way you _act_.\"\n\nThe funny thing, as far as Malone was concerned, was that the two\nparts of his personality were becoming more and more alike. He didn't\nactually believe that Her Majesty was Queen Elizabeth I, and he hoped\nfervently that he never would. But he did have a great deal of respect\nfor her, and more affection than he had believed possible at first.\nShe was the grandmother Malone had never known; she was good, and\nkind, and he wanted to keep her happy and contented. There had been\nnothing at all phony in the solemn toast he had proposed--nor in the\nrighteous indignation he had felt against anyone who was giving Her\nMajesty even a minute's worth of discomfort.\n\nAnd Boyd, surprisingly enough, seemed to feel the same way. Malone\nfelt good about that; Her Majesty needed all the loyal supporters she\ncould get.\n\nBut all of this was later. At the time, Malone was doing nothing\nexcept what came naturally--nor, apparently, was Boyd. After the\nglasses had been thrown, with a terrifying crash, into the metal\nwastebasket, and the reverberations of that second had stopped ringing\nin their ears, a moment of silence had followed.\n\nThen Boyd turned, briskly rubbing his hands. \"All right,\" he said.\n\"Let's get back to work.\"\n\nMalone looked at the proud, happy look on Her Majesty's face; he saw\nthe glimmer of a tear in the corner of each eye. But he gave no\nindication that he had noticed anything at all out of the ordinary.\n\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"Now, getting on back to the facts, we've established\nsomething, anyhow. Some agency is causing flashes of telepathic static\nall over the place. And those flashes are somehow connected with the\nconfusion that's going on all around us. Somehow, these flashes have\nan effect on the minds of people.\"\n\n\"And we know at least one manifestation of that effect,\" Boyd said.\n\"It makes spies blab all their secrets when they're exposed to it.\"\n\n\"These three spies, anyhow,\" Malone said.\n\n\"If 'spies' is the right word,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"And now we've got another obvious question.\"\n\n\"It seems to me we've got about twelve,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I mean: who's doing it?\" Malone said. \"Who is causing these\ntelepathic flashes?\"\n\n\"Maybe it's just happening,\" Boyd said. \"Out of thin air.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Malone said. \"But let's go on the assumption that there's a\nhuman cause. The other way, we can't do a thing except sit back and\nwatch the world go to hell.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"It doesn't seem to be the Russians,\" he said. \"Although,\nof course, it might be a Red herring.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"they might have known we were on to Brubitsch,\nBorbitsch and Garbitsch--\" He stopped. \"You know,\" he said, \"every\ntime I say that name I have to reassure myself that we're not all\nwalking around in the world of Florenz Ziegfeld?\"\n\n\"Likewise,\" Malone said. \"But go on.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"Anyhow, they might have set the three of them up\nas patsies--just in case we stumbled on to this mess. We can't\noverlook that possibility.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"It's faint, but it is a possibility. In other\nwords, the agency behind the flashes might be Russian, and it might\nnot be Russian.\"\n\n\"That clears that up nicely,\" Boyd said. \"Next question?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The next one,\" Malone said grimly, \"is: what's behind the flashes?\nSome sort of psionic power is causing them--that much is obvious.\"\n\n\"I'll go along with that,\" Boyd said. \"I have to go along with it. But\ndon't think I like it.\"\n\n\"Nobody likes it,\" Malone said. \"But let's go on. O'Connor isn't any\nhelp; he washes his hands of the whole business.\"\n\n\"Lucky man,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"He says that it can't be happening,\" Malone said, \"and if it is we're\nall screwy. Now, right or wrong, that isn't an opinion that gives us\nany handle to work with.\"\n\n\"No,\" Boyd said reflectively. \"A certain amount of comfort, to be\nsure, but no handles.\"\n\n\"Sir Lewis Carter, on the other hand--\" Malone said. He fumbled\nthrough some of the piles of paper until he had located the ones the\nPresident of the Psychical Research Society had sent. \"Sir Lewis\nCarter,\" he went on, \"does seem to be doing some pretty good work. At\nleast, some of the more modern stuff he sent over looks pretty solid.\nThey've been doing quite a bit of research into the subject, and their\ntheories seem to be all right, or nearly all right, to me. Of course,\nI'm not an expert--\"\n\n\"Who is?\" Boyd said. \"Except for O'Connor, of course.\"\n\n\"Well, somebody is,\" Malone said. \"Whoever's doing all this, for\ninstance. And the theories do seem O.K. In most cases, for instance,\nthey agree with O'Connor's work--though they're not in complete\nagreement.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" Boyd said. \"O'Connor wouldn't recognize an Astral\nPlane if TWA were putting them into service.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that sort of thing,\" Malone said. \"There's lots about\nastral bodies and ghosts, ectoplasm, Transcendental Yoga, theosophy,\nderos, the Great Pyramid, Atlantis, and other such pediculous pets.\nThat's just silly, as far as I can see. But what they have to say\nabout parapsychology and psionics as such does seem to be reasonably\naccurate.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Boyd said tiredly.\n\n\"O.K., then,\" Malone said. \"Did anybody notice anything in that pile\nof stuff that might conceivably have any bearing whatever on our\nproblems?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Boyd said. \"Or I think I did.\"\n\n\"You both did,\" Her Majesty said. \"And so did I, when I looked through\nit. But I didn't bother with it. I dismissed it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Because I don't think it's true,\" she said. \"However, my opinion is\nreally only an opinion.\" She smiled around at the others.\n\nMalone picked up a thick sheaf of papers from one of the piles of his\ndesk. \"Let's get straight what it is we're talking about,\" he said.\n\"All right?\"\n\n\"Anything's all right with me,\" Boyd said. \"I'm easy to please.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"Now, this writer ... what's his name?\" he said. He\nglanced at the copy of the cover page. \"'Minds and Morons',\" he read.\n\"By Cartier Taylor.\"\n\n\"Great title,\" Boyd said. \"Does he say which is which?\"\n\n\"Let's get back to serious business,\" Malone said, giving Boyd a\nsingle look. There was silence for a second, and then Malone said: \"He\nmentions something, in the book, that he calls 'telepathic\nprojection.' As far as I understand what he's talking about, that's\nsome method of forcing your thoughts on another person.\" He glanced\nover at the Queen. \"Now, Your Majesty,\" he said, \"you don't think it's\ntrue--and that may only be an opinion, but it's a pretty informed one.\nIt seems to me as if Taylor makes a good case for this 'telepathic\nprojection' of his. Why don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Her Majesty said flatly, \"it doesn't work.\"\n\n\"You've tried it?\" Boyd put in.\n\n\"I have,\" she said. \"And I have had no success with it at all. It's a\ncomplete failure.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Boyd said. \"Just a minute.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Malone said. \"Have you tried it, and made it\nwork?\"\n\nBoyd snorted. \"Fat chance,\" he said. \"I just want to look at the\nthing, that's all.\" He held out his hand, and Malone gave him the\nsheaf of papers. Boyd leafed through them slowly, stopping every now\nand again to consult a page, until he found what he was looking for.\n\"There,\" he said.\n\n\"There, what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Listen to this,\" Boyd said. \"'For those who draw the line at demonic\npossession, I suggest trying telepathic projection. Apparently, it is\npossible to project one's own thoughts directly into the mind of\nanother--even to the point of taking control of the other's mind.\nHypnotism? You tell me, and we'll both know. Ever since the orthodox\nscientists have come around to accepting hypnotism, I've been chary of\nit. Maybe there really is an astral body or a soul that a person has\nstashed about him somewhere--something that he can send out to take\ncontrol of another human being. But I, personally, prefer the\ntelepathic projection theory. All you have to do is squirt your\nthoughts across space and spray them all over the fellow's brain.\nPresto-bingo, he does pretty much what you want him to do.'\"\n\n\"That's the quote I was thinking of,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" Her Majesty said. \"But it really doesn't work. I've\ntried it.\"\n\n\"How have you tried it?\" Malone said.\n\n\"There were many times, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, \"when I wanted\nsomeone to do something particular--for me, or for some other person.\nAfter all, you must remember that I was in a hospital for a long\ntime. Of course, that represents only a short segment of my life span,\nbut it seemed long to me.\"\n\nMalone, who was trying to view the years from age fifteen to age\nsixty-odd as a short segment of anybody's lifetime, remembered with a\nshock that this was not Rose Thompson speaking. It was Queen Elizabeth\nI, who had never died.\n\n\"That's right, Sir Kenneth,\" she said kindly. \"And in that hospital,\nthere were a number of times when I wanted one of the doctors or\nnurses to do what I wanted them to. I tried many times, but I never\nsucceeded.\"\n\nBoyd nodded his head. \"Well--\" he began.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Sir Thomas,\" Her Majesty said. \"What you're thinking is\ncertainly possible. It may even be true.\"\n\n\"What _is_ he thinking?\" Malone said.\n\n\"He thinks,\" Her Majesty said, \"that I may not have the talent for\nthis particular effect--and perhaps I don't. But, talent or not, I\nknow what's possible and what isn't. And the way Mr. Taylor describes\nit is simply silly, that's all. And unladylike. Imagine any\nself-respecting lady 'squirting' her thoughts about in space!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said carefully, \"aside from its being unladylike--\"\n\n\"Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, \"you are not telepathic. Neither is\nSir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I'm nothing,\" Boyd said. \"I don't even exist.\"\n\n\"And it is very difficult to explain to the nontelepath just what Mr.\nTaylor is implying,\" Her Majesty went on imperturbably. \"Before you\ncould inject any thoughts into anyone else's mind, you'd have to be\nable to see into that mind. Is that correct?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I guess so,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And in order to do that, you'd have to be telepathic,\" Her Majesty\nsaid. \"Am I correct?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Her Majesty said with satisfaction, and beamed at him.\n\nA second passed.\n\n\"Well, then, what?\" Malone said in confusion.\n\n\"Telepathy,\" Her Majesty said patiently, \"is an extremely complex\naffair. It involves a sort of meshing with the mind of this other\nperson. It has nothing--absolutely nothing--in common with this simple\n'squirting' of thoughts across space, as if they were orange pips you\nwere trying to put into a wastebasket. No, Sir Kenneth, I cannot\nbelieve in what Mr. Taylor says.\"\n\n\"But it's still possible,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Her Majesty said, \"it's certainly possible. But I should think\nthat if any telepaths were around, and if they were changing people's\nminds by 'squirting' at them, I would know it.\"\n\nMalone frowned. \"Maybe you would at that,\" he said. \"I guess you\nwould.\"\n\n\"Not to mention,\" Boyd put in, \"that if you were going to control\neverything we've come across like that you'd need an awful lot of\ntelepathic operators.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Malone admitted. \"And the objections seem to make some\nsense. But what else is there to go on?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Boyd said. \"I haven't the faintest idea. And I'm\nrapidly approaching the stage where I don't care.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, heaving a sigh, \"let's keep looking.\"\n\nHe bent down and picked up another sheaf of copies from the Psychical\nResearch Society.\n\n\"After all,\" he said, without much hope, \"you never know.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nMalone looked around the office of Andrew J. Burris as if he'd never\nseen it before. He felt tired, and worn out, and depressed; it had\nbeen a long night, and here it was morning and the head of the FBI was\ntalking to him about his report. It was, Malone told himself heavily,\na hell of a life.\n\n\"Now, Malone,\" Burris said in a kindly voice, \"this is a very\ninteresting report.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said automatically.\n\n\"A very interesting report indeed, Kenneth,\" Burris went on,\npositively bursting with good-fellowship.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Malone said dully.\n\nBurris beamed a little more. \"You've done a fine job,\" he said, \"a\nreally fine job. Hardly on the job any time at all, and here you've\nmanaged to get all three of the culprits responsible.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Malone said in sudden panic. \"That isn't what I\nsaid.\"\n\n\"No?\" Burris said, looking a little surprised.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"I don't think those three spies have\nanything to do with this at all. Not a thing.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence, during which Burris' surprise seemed to\nexpand like a gas and fill the room. \"But they've confessed,\" he said\nat last. \"Their job was to try and get information, and also to\ndisrupt our own work here.\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\nBurris held up a pink, patient hand. Malone stared at it, fascinated.\nIt had five pink, patient fingers on it. \"Malone,\" Burris said slowly,\n\"just what's bothering you? Don't you think those men _are_ spies? Is\nthat it?\"\n\n\"Spies?\" Malone said, slightly confused.\n\n\"You know,\" Burris said. \"The men you arrested, Malone. The men you\nwrote this report about.\"\n\nMalone blinked and focused on the hand again. It still had five\nfingers. \"Sure they are,\" he said. \"They're spies, all right. And\nthey're caught, and that's that. Except I don't think they're causing\nall the confusion around here.\"\n\n\"Well, of course they're not,\" Burris said, the beam of kindliness\ncoming back to his face. \"Not any more. You caught them.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" Malone said desperately, \"they never were. Even before I\ncaught them.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" Burris said with great patience, \"did you arrest them?\"\n\n\"Because they're spies,\" Malone said. \"Besides, I didn't.\"\n\n\"Didn't what?\" Burris said, looking confused. He seemed to realize he\nwas still holding up his hand, and dropped it to the desk. Malone felt\nsad as he watched it go. Now he had nothing to concentrate on except\nthe conversation, and he didn't even want to think about what was\nhappening to that.\n\n\"Didn't arrest them,\" he said. \"Tom Boyd did.\"\n\n\"Acting,\" Burris pointed out gently, \"under your orders, Kenneth.\"\n\nIt was the second time Burris had called him Kenneth, Malone realized.\nIt started a small warning bell in the back of his mind. When Burris\ncalled him by his first name, Burris was feeling paternal and kindly.\nAnd that, Malone thought determinedly, boded Kenneth J. Malone very\nlittle good indeed.\n\n\"He was under my orders to arrest them because they were spies,\" he\nsaid at last. He wondered if the sentence made any real sense, but\nshrugged his shoulders and plunged on. \"But they're not the real\nspies,\" he said. \"Not the ones everybody's been looking for.\"\n\n\"Kenneth,\" Burris said, his voice positively dripping with what Malone\nthought of as the heavy, Grade A, Government-inspected cream of human\nkindness, \"all the confusion with the computer-secretaries has\nstopped. Everything is running fine in that department.\"\n\n\"But--\" Malone began.\n\n\"The technicians,\" Burris said, hypnotized by this poem of beauty,\n\"aren't making any more mistakes. The information is flowing through\nbeautifully. It's a pleasure to see their reports. Believe me,\nKenneth--\"\n\n\"Call me Chief,\" Malone said wearily.\n\nBurris blinked. \"What?\" he said. \"Oh. Ha. Indeed. Very well, then:\nMalone, what more proof do you want?\"\n\n\"Is that proof?\" Malone said. \"The spies didn't even confess to that.\nThey--\"\n\n\"Of course they didn't, Malone,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Of course?\" Malone said weakly.\n\n\"Look at their confessions,\" Burris said. \"Just look at them, in black\nand white.\" He reached for a sheaf of papers and pushed them across\nthe desk. Malone looked at them. They were indeed, he told himself, in\nblack and white. There was no arguing with that. None at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well?\" Burris said after a second.\n\n\"I don't see anything about computer-secretaries,\" Malone said.\n\n\"The Russians,\" Burris began slowly, \"are not stupid, Malone. You\nbelieve that, don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I believe it,\" Malone said. \"Otherwise we wouldn't need an\nFBI.\"\n\nBurris frowned. \"There are still domestic cases,\" he said. \"Like\njuvenile delinquents stealing cars inter-state, for instance. If you\nremember.\" He paused, then went on: \"But the fact remains: Russians\nare not stupid. Not by a long shot.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said agreeably.\n\n\"Do you really think, then,\" Burris said instantly, \"that a spy ring\ncould be as utterly inefficient as the one described in those\nconfessions?\"\n\n\"Lots of people are inefficient,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not spies,\" Burris said with decision. \"Do you really believe that\nthe Russians would send over a bunch of operatives as clodheaded as\nthese are pretending to be?\"\n\n\"People make mistakes,\" Malone said weakly.\n\n\"Russian spies,\" Burris said, \"do not make mistakes. Or, anyhow, we\ncan't depend on it. We have to depend on the fact that they're\noperating at peak efficiency, Malone. Peak.\"\n\nMalone nearly asked: \"Where?\" but controlled himself at the last\nminute. Instead, he said: \"But the confessions are right there. And,\naccording to the confessions--\"\n\n\"Do you really believe,\" Burris said, \"that a trio of Soviet agents\nwould confess everything as easily as all that if they didn't intend\nto get something out of it? Such as, for instance, covering up their\nmethods of doing damage? And do you really believe--\"\n\nMalone began to feel as if he were involved in the Athanasian Creed.\n\"I don't think the spies are the real spies,\" he said stubbornly. \"I\nmean the spies we're all looking for.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to stand there and tell me,\" Burris went on inexorably,\n\"that you take the word of spies when they tell you about their own\nactivities?\"\n\n\"Their confessions--\"\n\n\"Spies can lie, Malone,\" Burris said gently. \"As a matter of fact,\nthey usually do. We have come to depend on it as one of the facts of\nlife.\"\n\n\"But Queen Elizabeth,\" Malone said stubbornly, \"told me they weren't\nlying.\" As he finished the sentence, he suddenly realized what it\nsounded like. \"You know Queen Elizabeth,\" he said chummily.\n\n\"The Virgin Queen,\" Burris said helpfully.\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" Malone said, feeling uncomfortable. \"I mean Rose\nThompson. She thinks she's Queen Elizabeth and I just said it that way\nbecause--\"\n\n\"It's all right, Malone,\" Burris said softly. \"I know who you mean.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said. \"If Queen Elizabeth says the spies aren't\nlying, then--\"\n\n\"Then nothing,\" Burris said flatly. \"Miss Rose Thompson is a nice,\nsweet, little old lady. I admit that.\"\n\n\"And she's been a lot of help,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I admit that, too,\" Burris said. \"But she is also somewhat battier,\nMalone, than the entire Order Chiroptera, including Count Dracula and\nall his happy friends.\"\n\n\"She only thinks she's Queen Elizabeth I,\" Malone said defensively.\n\n\"That,\" Burris said, \"is a large sort of _only_. Malone, you've got to\nlook at the facts sensibly. Square in the face.\"\n\nMalone pictured a lot of facts going by with square faces. He didn't\nlike the picture. \"All right,\" he said.\n\n\"Things are going wrong in the Congressional computer-secretaries,\"\nBurris said. \"So I assign you to the case. You come back to me with\nthree spies, and the trouble stops. And what other information have\nyou got?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" Malone said, and stopped for thought. There was a long\npause.\n\n\"All this business about mysterious psionic faculties,\" Burris said,\n\"comes direct from the testimony of that sweet little old twitch.\nWhich she is. Dr. O'Connor, for instance, has told you in so many\nwords that there's no such thing as this mysterious force. And if you\ndon't want to take the word of the nation's foremost authority,\nthere's this character from the Psychical Research Society--Carter, or\nwhatever his name is. Carter told you he'd never heard of such a\nthing.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't mean there isn't such a thing,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Even your own star witness,\" Burris said, \"even the Queen herself,\ntold you it couldn't be done.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless--\" Malone began. But he felt puzzled. There was no way,\nhe decided, to finish a sentence that started with _nevertheless_. It\nwas the wrong kind of word.\n\n\"What are you trying to do?\" Burris said. \"Beat your head against a\nstone wall?\"\n\nMalone realized that that was just what he felt like. Of course,\nBurris thought the stone wall was his psionic theory. Malone knew that\nthe stone wall was Andrew J. Burris. But it didn't matter, he thought\nconfusedly. Where there's a stone, there's a way.\n\n\"I feel,\" he said carefully, \"like a man with a stone head.\"\n\n\"And I don't blame you,\" Burris said in an understanding tone. \"Here\nyou are trying to make evidence to fit your theories. What real\nevidence is there, Malone, that these three spies ... these three\ncomic-opera spies--are innocent?\"\n\n\"What evidence is there that they're guilty?\" Malone said. \"Now,\nlisten, Chief--\"\n\n\"Don't call me Chief,\" Burris murmured.\n\n\"Another five minutes,\" Malone said in a sudden rage, \"and I won't\neven call you.\"\n\n\"Malone!\" Burris said.\n\nMalone swallowed hard. \"Sorry,\" he said at last. \"But isn't it just\nbarely possible that these three spies aren't the real criminals?\nSuppose you were a spy.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Burris said. \"I'm a spy.\" Something in his tone made\nMalone look at him with a sudden suspicion. Burris, he thought, was\nhumoring him.\n\nIs it possible, Malone asked himself, that _I_ am the one who is as a\nlittle child?\n\nLittle children, he told himself with decision, do not capture Russian\nspies and then argue about it. They go home, eat supper and go to bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stopped thinking about sleep in a hurry, and got back to the\nbusiness at hand. \"If you were a spy,\" he said, \"and you knew that a\nlot of other spies had been arrested and charged with the crimes you\nwere committing, what would you do?\"\n\nBurris appeared to think deeply. \"I would celebrate,\" he said at last,\nin a judicious tone.\n\n\"I mean, would you just go on with the same crimes?\" Malone said.\n\n\"What are you talking about, Malone?\" Burris said cautiously.\n\n\"If you knew we'd arrested Brubitsch, Borbitsch and Garbitsch,\" Malone\nwent on doggedly, \"you'd lay off for a while, just to make us think\nwe'd caught the right men. Doesn't that make sense?\"\n\n\"Of course it makes sense,\" Burris said in what was almost a pitying\ntone. \"But don't push it too far. Malone, I want you to know\nsomething.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"Yes, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"Contrary to popular opinion,\" Burris said, \"I was not appointed\nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation just because I own a\nHoover vacuum cleaner.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Malone said, feeling that something of the sort was\ncalled for.\n\n\"And I think you ought to know by now,\" Burris went on, \"that I\nwouldn't fall for a trick like that any more than you would. There are\nobviously more members in this spy ring. Brubitsch, Borbitsch and\nGarbitsch are just a start.\"\n\n\"Well, then--\" Malone began.\n\n\"_I'm_ not going to be taken in by what these three say,\" Burris said.\n\"But now, Malone, we know what to look for. All we have to do is\npretend to be taken in. Get it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"We pretend to be taken in. And in the meantime I\ncan go on looking for--\"\n\n\"We don't have to look for anything,\" Burris said calmly.\n\nMalone took a deep breath. Somehow, he told himself, things were not\nworking out very well. \"But the other spies--\"\n\n\"The next time they try anything,\" Burris said, \"we'll be able to\nreach out and pick them up as easy as falling off a log.\"\n\n\"It's the wrong log!\" Malone said.\n\nBurris folded his hands on the desk and looked at them for a second,\nfrowning slightly like a psychiatrist. \"Malone,\" he said at last, \"I\nwant you to listen to me. Calmly. Coolly. Collectedly.\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"All right,\" he said. \"I'm calm and cool.\"\n\n\"And collected,\" Burris added.\n\n\"That, too,\" Malone said vaguely.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris began, \"you've got to get rid of this idea that\neverything the FBI investigates these days is somehow linked with\npsionics. I know you've done a lot of work in that connection--\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"There are those errors. How did\nthe technicians feed the wrong data into the machines?\"\n\n\"Errors do happen,\" Burris said. \"If I slip on a banana peel, do I\nblame psionics? Do I even blame the United Fruit Growers? I do not,\nMalone. Instead, I tell myself that errors do happen. All the time.\"\n\n\"Now,\" Malone said, \"you've contradicted yourself.\"\n\n\"I have?\" Burris said with a look of complete surprise.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. He leaned forward across the desk. \"If the errors\nwere just ordinary accidental errors, then how were the spies\nresponsible? And why did they stop after the spies were arrested? When\nyou slip on a banana peel, does it matter whether or not the United\nFruit Growers are out on strike?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Burris said.\n\n\"You see?\" Malone said. \"You've gone and contradicted yourself.\" He\nfelt victorious, but somewhere in the back of his mind was the\nhorrible sensation that someone was about to come up behind him and\nhit him on the head with a wet sock full of old sand.\n\nA long second passed. Then Burris said: \"Oh. Malone, I forgot to give\nyou the analysis report.\"\n\nThat, Malone realized dimly, was supposed to be the wet sock. Fate, he\ntold himself, was against him. Anyhow, something was against him. It\nwas a few seconds before he came to the conclusion that what he had\nheard didn't really make any sense. \"Analysis report?\" he said.\n\n\"On the water cooler,\" Burris explained cheerfully.\n\n\"There is an analysis report on a water cooler,\" Malone said.\n\"Everything now becomes as clear as crystal.\" He heard his voice begin\nto rise. \"You analyzed a water cooler and discovered that it was a\nSiberian spy in disguise,\" he said, trying to make himself sound less\nhysterical.\n\n\"No, no,\" Burris said, pushing at Malone with his palms. \"The water in\nit, Malone. The water in it.\"\n\n\"No Siberian spy,\" Malone said with decision, \"could disguise himself\nas the water in a water cooler.\"\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" Burris went on. \"But what do you think was in\nthat water cooler, Malone?\"\n\n\"Water,\" Malone said. \"_Cool_ water.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Burris said, in the hearty tones usually reserved\nfor announcers on programs where housewives win trips to Nome. \"You\nare just a shade less than ninety-nine point nine nine per cent\ncorrect.\"\n\n\"The rest of the water,\" Malone hazarded, \"was warm?\"\n\n\"The rest of the water,\" Burris said, \"wasn't water. Aside from the\nusual minerals, there was also a trace of one of the psychodrugs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe word seemed to hang in mid-air, like somebody's sword. Malone knew\nperfectly well what the psychodrugs were. Over the past twenty years,\na great number of them had been developed by confused and anxious\nresearchers. Some were solids, some liquids and a few gaseous at\nnormal temperatures. Some were weak and some were highly potent. Some\nwere relatively innocuous, and quite a few were as deadly as any of\nthe more common poisons. They could be administered by mouth, by\ninjection, by spray, as drops, grains, whiffs or in any other way\nconceivable to medical science. But they all had one thing in common.\nThey affected the mental functioning--what seemed to be the\npersonality itself--of the person dosed with them.\n\nThe effect of the drugs was, in most cases, highly specific. One might\nmake a normally brave man a craven coward; laboratory tests on that\none had presented the interesting spectacle of terrified cats running\nfrom surprised, but by no means displeased, experimental mice. Another\ndrug reversed this picture, and made the experimental mice mad with\npower. They attacked cats in battalions or singly, cheering and almost\nwaving large flags as they went over the top, completely foolhardy in\nthe presence of any danger whatever. Others made man abnormally\nsuspicious and still others disassociated judgment to the point where\nall decisions were made completely at random.\n\nThe FBI had a large file on psychodrugs, Malone knew. But he didn't\nneed the file to see what was coming. He asked the question anyhow,\njust for the record: \"What particular psychodrug was this one?\"\n\n\"One of the judgment-warpers,\" Burris said. \"Haenlingen's Mixture;\nit's more or less a new development, but the Russians probably know as\nmuch about it as we do. In large doses, the drug affects even the\nautomatic nervous system and throws the involuntary functions out of\nwhack; but it isn't usually used in killing amounts.\"\n\n\"And in the water cooler?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"There wasn't much of it,\" Burris said, \"but there was enough. The\ntechnicians could be depended on to make a great many more mistakes\nthan usual--just how many we can't determine, but the order of\nmagnitude seems about right. It would depend on how much water each\none of them drank, of course, and we haven't a chance of getting\nanything like a precise determination of that now.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"But it comes out about right, doesn't it?\" He felt\nhopeless.\n\n\"Just about,\" Burris said cheerfully. \"And since it was Brubitsch's\njob to change the cooler jug--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"I think I see a hole in that.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Burris said. He frowned slightly.\n\nMalone nodded. \"Sure,\" he said. \"If any of the spies drank the\nwater--their judgment would be warped, too, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"So they didn't drink the water,\" Burris said easily.\n\n\"How can we be sure?\" Malone asked.\n\nBurris shrugged. \"Why do we have to be?\" he said. \"Malone, you've got\nto stop pressing so hard on this.\"\n\n\"But a man who didn't drink water all day would be a little\nconspicuous,\" Malone said. \"After a while, anyhow.\"\n\nBurris sighed. \"The man is a janitor, Kenneth,\" he said. \"Do you know\nwhat a janitor is?\"\n\n\"Don't baby me,\" Malone snapped.\n\nBurris shrugged. \"A janitor doesn't work in the office with the men,\"\nhe said. \"He can drink out of a faucet in the broom closet--or\nwherever the faucets might be. Nobody would notice. Nobody would think\nit odd.\"\n\nMalone said: \"But--\" and stopped and thought it over. \"All right,\" he\nwent on at last. \"But I still insist--\"\n\n\"Now, Kenneth,\" Burris said in a voice that dripped oil. \"I'll admit\nthat psionics is new and wonderful and you've done a lot of fine work\nwith it. A lot of very fine work indeed. But you can't go around\nblaming everything on psionics no matter what it is or how much sense\nit makes.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" Malone said, injured. \"But--\"\n\n\"But you do,\" Burris said. \"Lately, you've been acting as though magic\nwere loose in the world. As though nothing were dependable any more.\"\n\n\"It's not magic,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But it is,\" Burris told him, \"when you use it as an explanation for\nanything and everything.\" He paused, \"Kenneth,\" he said in a more\nkindly tone, \"don't think I blame you. I know how hard you've been\nworking. I know how much time and effort you've put into the gallant\nfight against this country's enemies.\"\n\nMalone closed his eyes and turned slightly green. \"It was nothing,\" he\nsaid at last. He opened his eyes but nothing had changed. Burris'\nexpression was still kindly and concerned.\n\n\"Oh, but it was,\" Burris said. \"Something, I mean. You've been working\nvery hard and you're just not at peak efficiency any more. You need a\nrest, Kenneth. A nice rest.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" Malone said indignantly.\n\n\"A lovely rest,\" Burris went on, oblivious. \"Somewhere peaceful and\nquiet, where you can just sit around and think peacefully about\npeaceful things. Oh, it ought to be wonderful for you, Kenneth. A\nnice, peaceful, lovely, wonderful vacation.\"\n\nThrough the haze of adjectives, Malone remembered dimly the last time\nBurris had offered him a vacation in that tone of voice. It had turned\nout to be one of the toughest cases he'd ever had: the case of the\nteleporting delinquents.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Nice?\" Malone said. \"Peaceful? Lovely? Wonderful? I can see it now.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Malone?\" Burris said.\n\n\"What am I going to get?\" Malone said. \"A nice easy job like arresting\nall the suspected nose-pickers in Mobile, Alabama?\"\n\nBurris choked and recovered quickly. \"No,\" he said. \"No, no, no. I\nmean it. You've earned a vacation, Kenneth, a real vacation. A nice,\npeaceful--\"\n\n\"Lovely, wonderful vacation,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"You're one of my best agents,\" Burris said. \"I might almost say\nyou're my top man. My very top man. And because of that I've been\noverworking you.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" Burris said, waving a hand vaguely. \"I have been\noverworking you, Kenneth, and I'm sorry. I want to make amends.\"\n\n\"A what?\" Malone said, feeling confused again.\n\n\"Amends,\" Burris said. \"I want to do something for you.\"\n\nMalone thought about that for a second. Burris was well-meaning, all\nright, but from the way the conversation was going it looked very much\nas if \"vacation\" weren't going to be the right word.\n\nThe right word, he thought dismally, was going to be \"rest home.\" Or\npossibly even \"insane asylum.\"\n\n\"I don't want to stop work,\" he said grimly. \"Really, I don't.\"\n\n\"You'll have lots of time to yourself,\" Burns said in a wheedling\ntone.\n\nMalone nodded. \"Sure I will,\" he said. \"Until they come and put me in\na wet pack.\"\n\nBurris blinked, but recovered gamely. \"You don't have to go swimming,\"\nhe said, \"if you don't want to go swimming. Up in the mountains, for\ninstance--\"\n\n\"Where there are nice big guards to watch everything,\" Malone said.\n\"And nuts.\"\n\n\"Guides,\" Burris said. \"But you could just sit around and take things\neasy.\"\n\n\"All locked up,\" Malone said. \"Sure. I'll love it.\"\n\n\"If you want to go out,\" Burris said, \"you can go out. Anywhere. Just\ndo whatever you feel like doing.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"When do the men in the white coats\narrive?\"\n\n\"White coats?\" Burris said. There was a short silence. \"Kenneth,\" he\nsaid, \"don't suspect me of trying to do anything to you. This is my\nway of doing you a favor. It would just be a vacation--going anywhere\nyou want to go, doing anything you want to do.\"\n\n\"Avacado,\" Malone muttered at random.\n\nBurris stared. \"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said shamefacedly. \"An old song. It runs through my\nmind. And when you said that about going where I want to go--\"\n\n\"An old song with avacados in it?\" Burris said.\n\nMalone cleared his throat and burst into shy and slightly hoarse song.\n\n\"Avacado go where you go,\" he piped feebly, \"do what you do--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Burris said. \"Oh, my.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone muttered. He took a breath and waited. A second\npassed.\n\n\"Well, Kenneth,\" Burris said at last, with an attempt at heartiness,\n\"you can do anything you like. The mountains. The seashore. Hawaii.\nThe Riviera. Just go and forget all about gangsters, spies,\ncounter-espionage, kidnapings, mad telepaths, juvenile teleports and\nanything else like that.\"\n\n\"You forgot water coolers,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded. \"And water coolers,\" he said, \"by all means. Forget\nabout FBI business. Forget about me. Just relax.\"\n\nIt did sound appealing, Malone told himself. But there was a case to\nfinish, and he was sure Burris was finishing it wrong. He wanted to\nargue about it some more, but he was fresh out of arguments.\n\nAnd besides, the idea of being able to forget all about Andrew J.\nBurris for a little while was almost insidious. Malone liked it more\nthe more he thought about it. Burris went on naming vacation spots and\ndrawing magnificent travel-agency pictures of how wonderful life could\nbe, and after a while Malone left. There just wasn't anything else to\nsay. Burris had given him an order for his vacation pay and another\nguaranteeing travel expenses. Not, he thought glumly, that he would be\nexpected to buy return tickets. Oh, no. Once he'd been to a place he\ncould teleport back, so there would be no point in taking a plane or\na train back from wherever he went.\n\n\"And suppose I like planes and trains?\" he muttered, going on down the\nhall. But there was nothing he could do about it. He did think of\nlooking for some sympathy, at least, but he couldn't even get much of\nthat. Tom Boyd had apparently already talked to Burris, and was in\nfull agreement with him.\n\n\"After all,\" Boyd said, \"there's the drug in the water--and it looks\nlike pretty solid proof to me, Ken.\"\n\n\"It's not proof of anything,\" Malone said sourly.\n\n\"Sure it is,\" Boyd said. \"Why would anybody put it there otherwise?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Who knows?\" he said. \"But I'm not surprised you like\nBurris' theory. Psionics never did make you very happy, did it?\"\n\n\"Not very,\" Boyd admitted. \"This way, anyhow, I've got something I can\ncope with. And it makes nice, simple sense. No reason to go and\ncomplicate it, Ken. None at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlumly, Malone made his farewells and then teleported himself from the\nJustice Department Building back to his own apartment. There, slowly\nand sadly, he began to pack. He hadn't yet decided just where he _was_\ngoing, but that was a minor detail. The important thing was that he\nwas going. If the Director of the FBI tells you that you need a rest\ncure, Malone thought, you do not argue with him. Argument may result\nin your vacation being extended indefinitely. And that is not a good\nthing.\n\nOf course, such a \"vacation\" wouldn't be the end of the world. Not\nquite. He could even beat Burris to the gun, hand in his resignation\nand go into private practice as a lawyer. The name of Malone, he told\nhimself proudly, had not been entirely forgotten in Chicago, by any\nmeans. But he didn't feel happy about the idea. He knew, perfectly\nwell, that he didn't want to live by trading on his father's\nreputation. And besides, he _liked_ being an FBI agent. It had\nglamour. It had standing.\n\nIt had everything. It even had trouble.\n\nMalone caught his whirling mind and forced it back to a landing.\nWhere, he asked himself, was he going?\n\nHe thought about that for a second. Perhaps, as Burris had apparently\nsuspected, he was going nuts. When he considered it, it even sounded\nlike a good possibility.\n\nAfter all, what evidence _did_ he have for his psionic theory? Her\nMajesty had told him about those peculiar bursts of metal energy,\ntrue. But there wasn't anything else. And, come to think of it, wasn't\nit possible that Her Majesty had slipped just a little off the trolley\nof her one-track psychosis?\n\nAt that thought a quick wave of guilt swept through him. Her Majesty,\nafter all, might be reading his mind from Yucca Flats, where she had\nreturned the previous night, right at that moment. He felt as if he\nhad committed high, middle and low treason all in one great big\npackage, not to mention Jack and the Game, he added disconsolately.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" he muttered, and stopped. He blinked and started over\nagain. In spite of all that, he told himself, the Burris Theory\ncertainly looked a lot sounder when you considered it objectively.\n\nThe big question was whether or not he _wanted_ to consider it\nobjectively. But he put this aside for the future, and continued\npacking slowly and carefully. When at last he snapped shut the last\nsuitcase, he still hadn't made up his mind as to the best spot for a\nvacation. Images tumbled through his brain: mountains, seacoasts,\nbeaches, beautiful native girls and even a few insane asylums. But\nnothing definite appeared. He sat down in his favorite easychair,\nfound a cigar and lit it, and luxuriated in the soothing fumes while\nhis mind began to wander.\n\nHer Majesty, he was quite certain, wouldn't lie purposely. Granted,\nshe had misled him now and again, but even when she felt misleading\nnecessary she hadn't lied; she had merely juggled the truth a little.\nAnd Malone was sure she would continue to tell him the truth as she\nknew it.\n\nOf course, that was the stopper: _as she knew it_. And she might have\ndeveloped another delusion. In which case, he thought sadly, Burris\nwas very probably right.\n\nBut she might also be telling the actual truth. And that meant, Malone\nthought, that little pops of energy were occasionally bursting in\nvarious minds. These little pops had an effect, or an apparent effect:\nthey made people change their minds about doing one thing or another.\n\nAnd that meant--Malone stopped, his cigar halfway to his mouth.\n\n_Wasn't it possible that just such a burst of energy had made Burris\ncall him off the case?_\n\nIt seemed like a long time before the cigar reached his mouth. Malone\nfelt slightly appalled. The flashes that had been going on in his own\nmind had already been bothering him, and he'd decided that he'd have\nto check every decision he made to be sure that it was not capricious;\nnow he made a resolve that he'd kept his mental faculties on a\nperpetual watch for that sort of interference. Of course, it was more\nthan barely possible that he wouldn't notice it if anything happened.\nBut it would be pretty stupid to succumb to that sort of defeatism\nnow, he told himself grimly.\n\nNow that everything was narrowing down so nicely, anyhow, he thought.\nThere were only two real possibilities. Malone numbered them in his\nmind:\n\n1. Her Majesty has developed a new delusion. In this case, he thought,\nBurris was perfectly right. I can enjoy a month of free vacation.\n\n2. Her Majesty is no nuttier than before. If this is the case, he\nthought, then there's more to the case than has appeared, and Kenneth\nJ. Malone, with or without the FBI, is going to get to the bottom of\nit.\n\nTherefore, he summed up, everything now hinged on whether or not Her\nMajesty was unhinged.\n\nThat was confusing, but he managed to straighten it out after a\nsecond. He put his half-smoked cigar carefully in an ashtray and stood\nup. He went over to the phone and dialed the special unlisted number\nof the FBI.\n\nThe face that appeared was faintly sallow and looked sad. \"Pelham\nhere,\" it said in the tones of a discouraged horse.\n\n\"Hello, Pelham,\" Malone said. \"Kenneth Malone here.\"\n\n\"Trouble?\" Pelham said. It was obvious that he expected trouble, and\nalways had, and probably always would.\n\n\"Nope,\" Malone said. Pelham looked even sadder. \"Just checking out for\nvacation. You can tell the Chief I'm going to take off for Las Vegas.\nI'm taking his advice, tell him; I'm going to carouse and throw my\nmoney away and look at dancing girls and smoke and drink and stay out\nlate. I'll let the local office know where I'm staying when I get\nthere, just in case something comes up.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Pelham said unhappily. \"I'll check you out.\" He tried a smile,\nbut it looked more like the blank expression on the face of a local\ncorpse. \"Have fun,\" he said.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"I'll try.\"\n\nBut his precognitive sense suddenly rose up on its hind legs as he\nbroke the connection. The attempt to have fun, it told him in no\nuncertain terms, was going to be a morbid failure.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" Malone muttered, heaved a great sigh, and started for\nthe suitcase and the door.\n\n\nVIII\n\nThe Great Universal was not the tops in every field. Not by a long\nshot. As Las Vegas resorts went, as a matter of fact, almost any of\nthem could outdo the Great Universal in one respect or another. The\nGolden Palace, for instance, had much gaudier gaming rooms. The\nMoonbeam had a louder orchestra. The Barbary Coast and the Ringing\nWelkin both had more slot machines, and it was undeniable that the\nFlower of the West had fatter and pinker dancing girls. The Red Hot,\nthe Last Fling and the Double Star all boasted more waiters and more\nfamous guests per square foot of breathable air.\n\nBut the Great Universal, in sheer size, volume of business and\nelegance of surroundings, outdid any three of the others combined. It\nstood grandly alone at the edge of the Strip, the grandiloquent Las\nVegas version of Broadway or Hollywood Boulevard. It had a central\nTower that climbed thirty stories into the clean desert air, and the\nTower was surrounded by a quarter of a square mile of single-level\nstructures. At the base, the building spread out for five hundred feet\nin every direction, and beyond that were the clusters of individual\ncabins interlaced by walks, small parks, an occasional pool, and a few\nlittle groves of trees \"for privacy and the feeling of oneness with\nNature,\" the brochure said. But the brochure didn't even do justice to\nthe place. Nothing could have except the popping eyes of the thousand\nof tourists who saw the Great Universal every month. And they were\nusually in no condition to sit down and talk calmly about it.\n\nAround the entire collection of buildings rose a wall that fitted the\narchitectural style of the place perfectly. A Hollywood writer out for\na three-day bender had called it \"Futuristic Mediaeval,\" since it\nseemed to be a set-designer's notion of Camelot combined with a\nTwenty-fifth Century city as imagined by Frank R. Paul. It had\nEgyptian designs on it, but no one knew exactly why. On the other\nhand, of course, there was no real reason why not.\n\nThat was not the only decoration. Emblazoned on the Tower, in huge\nletters of evershifting color, was a glowing sign larger than the eye\ncould believe. The sign proclaimed through daylight and the darkest\nnight: Great Universal Hotel. Malone had no doubts about it.\n\nThere was a running argument as to whether or not the Great Universal\nwas actually on the Strip. Certainly the original extent of the Strip\ndidn't include it. But the Strip itself had been spreading Westward at\na slow but steady pace for two decades, and the only imaginable\nstopping-point was the California border.\n\nMalone had taken a taxi from the airfield, and had supplied himself\nwith silver dollars there. He gave the cabbie one of them and added\nanother when the man's expression showed real pain. Still unhappy but\nlooking a little less like a figure out of the Great Depression, the\ncabbie gunned his machine away, leaving Malone standing in the carport\nsurrounded by suitcases and bags of all sizes and weights.\n\nA robot redcap came gliding along. Inevitably, it was gilded, and\nlooked absolutely brand new. Behind it, a chunky little man with\nbright eyes waved at Malone. \"Reserved here?\" he said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"The name is Malone.\"\n\nThe redcap's escort shrugged. \"I don't care if the name is Jack the\nRipper,\" he said. \"Just reservations, that's all I care.\"\n\nMalone watched the luggage being stowed away, and followed after the\nredcap and its escort with mixed feelings. Las Vegas glittered like\nmad, but the two inhabitants he had met so far seemed a little dim.\nHowever, he told himself, better things might turn up.\n\nBetter things did, almost immediately. In the great lobby of the\nTower, guests were lounging about in little groups. Many of the guests\nwere dressed in tuxedos, others in sport shirts and slacks. Quite a\nnumber were wearing dresses, skirt-and-blouse combinations or evening\ngowns, and Malone paid most of his attention to these.\n\nNew York, Washington and even Chicago had nothing to match them, he\nthought dazedly. They were magnificent, and almost frightening in\ntheir absolute beauty. Malone however, was not easily daunted. He\nfollowed a snappily-dressed bellman to the registration desk while his\nrobot purred gently after him. First things first, he thought--but\nmaking friends with the other guests definitely came up number two. Or\nthree, anyhow, he amended sadly.\n\nHe signed his own name to the register, but didn't add: \"Federal\nBureau of Investigation\" after it. After all, he thought, he was there\nunofficially. And even though gambling was perfectly legal in Nevada,\nthe thought of the FBI still made many of the club owners just the\nleast little bit nervous. Instead, Malone gave a Chicago firm as his\nbusiness address--one which the FBI used as a cover for just such\npurposes.\n\nThe clerk looked at him politely and blankly. \"A room in the Tower,\nsir?\" he said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"Ground floor,\" he said. \"But not too far from\nthe Tower. I get airsick easily.\"\n\nThe clerk gave Malone a large laugh, which made him uncomfortable and\na little angry. The joke hadn't been all that good, he thought. If\nhe'd ordered a top-price room he could understand the hospitality, but\nthe most expensive rooms were in the Tower, with the outside cabins\nrunning a close second. The other rooms dropped in price as they\napproached the periphery of the main building.\n\n\"A humorist, sir?\" the clerk said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said pleasantly, wishing he'd signed with his\nfull occupation and address. \"I'm a gravedigger. Business has been\nvery good this year.\"\n\nThe clerk, apparently undecided as to whether or not to offer\ncongratulations, settled for consulting his registry and then stabbing\nat a button on a huge and complex board at his right. A key slid out\nof a slot and the clerk handed it to Malone with a rather strained\nsmile. \"10-Q,\" he said.\n\n\"You're very welcome,\" Malone said in his most unctuous tones. He took\nthe key.\n\nThe clerk blinked. \"The bellman will take you to your rooms, sir,\" he\nsaid in a good imitation of his original voice. \"There are maps of the\nbuilding at intervals along the halls, and if you find that you have\nbecome lost you have only to ask one of the hall guides to show you\nthe proper directions.\"\n\n\"My, my,\" Malone said.\n\nThe clerk cleared his throat. \"If you wish to use one of the cars,\" he\nwent on in a slightly more unsteady voice, \"simply insert your key in\nthe slot beneath one of the wall maps, and a car will be at your\nservice.\"\n\nMalone shook his head and gave a deep sigh. \"What,\" he said, \"will\nthey think of next?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSatisfied with that for an exit line, he turned and found that the\nbellman had already taken his luggage from the robot redcap and put it\naboard a small electric car. Malone got in beside him and the bellman\nstarted the vehicle down the hallway. It rolled along on soft, silent\ntires. It, too, was gilded. It didn't move very fast, Malone thought,\nbut it certainly beat walking.\n\nEach hallway which radiated out from the central section beneath the\nTower was built like a small-edition city street. The little cars\nscooted up and down the two center lanes while pedestrians, poor\nbenighted souls, kept to the side walkways. Every so often Malone saw\none, walking along the raised walkway and holding the rail along the\noutside that was meant to keep guests of every stage of drunkenness\nfrom falling into the road. At the intersections, small,\nJapanese-style bridges crossed over the roadway. On these, Malone saw\nuniformed men standing motionless, one to a bridge. They all looked\nidentical, and each one had a small gold stripe sewn to the chest of\nthe red uniform. Malone read the letters on the stripe as they passed\nthe third man. It said: _Guide_.\n\n\"Now, you live in Q-wing, sir,\" the bellman was saying in a nasal, but\nrather pleasant voice as Malone looked away. \"You're not far from the\nTower Lobby, so you won't have a lot to remember. It's not like living\nalong, say, the D-E Passageway out near 20 or 23.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it isn't,\" Malone said politely.\n\n\"No,\" the bellman said, \"you got it simple. This here is Q-Yellow--see\nthe yellow stripe on the wall?\"\n\nMalone looked. There was a yellow stripe on the wall. \"I see it,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"So all you got to do,\" the bellman said, \"is follow Q-Yellow to the\nTower Lobby.\" He acted as if he had demonstrated a Euclidean\nproposition flawlessly. \"Got it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very simple,\" Malone said.\n\n\"O.K.,\" the bellman said. \"Now, the gaming rooms--\"\n\nMalone listened with about a fifth of an ear while the bellman went on\nspinning out incredibly complex directions for getting around in the\nquasi-city that was the Great Universal. At one point he thought he\ncaught the man saying that an elephant ramp took guests past the\nresplendent glass rest rooms to the roots of the roulette wheel, but\nthat didn't sound even remotely plausible when he considered it. At\nlast the bellman announced:\n\n\"Here we are, sir. Right to your door. A courtesy of the friendly\nGreat Universal Hotel.\"\n\nHe pulled over to the side, pushed a button on the sidewalk, and the\nlittle car's body elevated itself on hydraulic pistons until it was\neven with the elevated sidewalk. The bellman pushed a stud on the\nwalkway rail and a gate swung open. Malone stepped out and waited\nwhile luggage was unloaded. The courtesy of the Great Universal Hotel\nwas not free, of course; Malone got rid of some more silver dollars.\nHe fished in his pockets, found one lone crumpled ten-dollar bill and\narranged it neatly and visibly in his right hand.\n\n\"I notice you've got a lot of guides in the halls,\" he said as the\nbellman eyed the ten-spot. \"Do that many people get lost in here?\"\n\n\"Well, not really, sir,\" the bellman said. \"Not really. That's for\nthe--what they call the protection of our guests. A courtesy.\"\n\n\"Protection?\" Malone said. He had noticed, he recalled, odd bulges\nbeneath the left armpits of the guides. \"Protection from what?\" he\nasked, keeping a firm, loving grip on the bill. \"There are a lot more\nguides than you'd expect, aren't there?\"\n\nThe bellman shifted uneasily from foot to foot. \"Well, sir,\" he said\nat last in an uneasy manner, \"I guess it's because of the politics\naround here. I mean, it's sort of confused.\"\n\n\"Confused how?\" Malone said, waving the bill ever so slightly.\n\nThe bellman appeared to be hypnotized by its green color. \"It's the\ngovernor shooting himself,\" he said at last. \"And the Legislature\nwants to impeach the Lieutenant-governor, and the City Council of Las\nVegas is having trouble with the Mayor, and the County Sheriff is\nhaving a feud with the State Police, and--Sir, it's all sort of\nconfused right now. But it isn't serious.\" He grinned hopefully.\n\nMalone sighed and let go of the ten. It stayed fluttering in the air\nfor perhaps a tenth of a second, and disappeared. \"I'm sure it isn't,\"\nMalone said. \"Just forget I asked you.\"\n\nThe bellman's hand went to his pocket and came out again empty. \"Asked\nme, sir?\" he said. \"Asked me what?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next fifteen minutes were busy ones. Malone made himself quickly\nat home, keeping his eyes open for hidden TV cameras or other forms of\nbugging. Satisfied at last that he was entirely alone, he took a deep\nbreath, closed his eyes and teleported himself to Yucca Flats.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis time, he didn't land in Dr. O'Connor's office. Instead, he opened\nhis eyes in the hallway in the nearby building that housed the\npsychologists, psychiatrists and psychotherapists who were working\nwith the telepaths Malone and the FBI had unearthed two years before.\n\nApparently, telepathy was turning out to be more a curse than a\nblessing. Of the seven known telepaths in the world, only Her Majesty\nretained anything like the degree of sanity necessary for\ncommunication. The psych men who were working with the other six had\nbeen trying to establish some kind of rapport, but their efforts so\nfar had been as fruitless as a petrified tree.\n\nMalone went down the hallway until he came to a door near the end. He\nlooked at the sign painted on the opaqued glass for a second:\n\n                 ALAN MARSHALL, M.D.\n                   CHIEF OF STAFF\n                PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT\n\nWith a slight sigh, he pushed open the door and went in.\n\nDr. Marshall was a tall, balding man with a light-brown brush mustache\nand a pleasant smile. He wore thick glasses but he didn't look at all\nscholarly; instead, he looked rather like Alec Guinness made up for a\nrole as a Naval lieutenant. He rose as Malone entered, and stretched a\nhand across the desk. \"Glad to see you, Sir Kenneth,\" he said. \"Very\nglad.\"\n\nMalone shook hands and raised his eyebrows. \"_Sir_ Kenneth?\" he said.\n\nDr. Marshall shrugged slightly. \"She prefers it,\" he said. \"And since\nthere's no telling whose mind she might look into--\" He smiled. \"After\nall,\" he finished, \"why not?\"\n\n\"Tell me, doctor,\" Malone said. \"Don't you ever get uneasy about the\nfact that Her Majesty can look into your mind? I mean, it has\ndisturbed some people.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Marshall said. \"Not in the least. After all, Sir\nKenneth, it's all a matter of adjustment. Simple adjustment and no\nmore.\" He paused, then added: \"Like sex.\"\n\n\"Sex?\" Malone said in a voice he hoped was calm.\n\n\"Cultural mores,\" Marshall said. \"That sort of thing. Nothing,\nreally.\" He sat down. \"Make yourself comfortable,\" he told Malone. \"As\na matter of fact, the delusion Her Majesty suffers from has its\ncompensations for the psychiatrist. Where else could I be appointed\nRoyal Psychiatrist, Advisor to the Crown, and Earl Marshal?\"\n\nMalone looked around, found a comfortable chair and dropped into it.\n\"I suppose so,\" he said. \"It must be sort of fun, in a way.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is,\" Marshall said. \"Of course, it can get to be specifically\ntroublesome; all cases can. I remember a girl who'd managed to get\nherself married to the wrong man--she was trying to escape her mother,\nor some such thing. And she'd moved into this apartment where her\nnext-door neighbor, a nice woman really, had rather strange sexual\ntendencies. Well, what with those problems, and the husband himself--a\nrather ill-tempered brute, but a nice fellow basically--and her\neventually meeting Mr. Right, which was inevitable--\"\n\n\"I'm sure it was very troublesome,\" Malone put in.\n\n\"Extremely,\" Marshall said. \"Worked out in the end, though. Ah ...\nmost of them do seem to, when we're lucky. When things break right.\"\n\n\"And when they don't?\" Malone said.\n\nMarshall shook his head slowly and rubbed at his forehead with two\nfingers. \"We do what we can,\" he said. \"It's an infant science. I\nremember one rather unhappy case--started at a summer theatre, but the\ncomplications didn't stop there. As I recall, there were something\nlike seven women and three men involved deeply before it began to\nstraighten itself out. My patient was a young boy. Ah ... he had\nactually precipitated the situation, or was convinced that he had. All\nbasically nice people, by the way. All of them. But the kind of thing\nthey managed to get mixed up in--\"\n\n\"I'm sure it was interesting,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Oh, they're all interesting,\" Marshall said. \"But for sheer\ncomplexity ... well, this is an unusual sort of case, the one I'm\nthinking about now. I remember it began with a girl named Ned--\"\n\n\"Dr. Marshall,\" Malone said desperately, \"I'd like to hear about a\ngirl named Ned. I really would. It doesn't even sound probable.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Dr. Marshall said. \"I'd like to tell you--\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" Malone went on doggedly, \"there is some business I've\ngot to talk over.\"\n\nDr. Marshall's disappointment was evident for less than a second.\n\"Yes, Sir Kenneth?\" he said.\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"It's about Her Majesty's mental state,\" he\nsaid. \"I understand that a lot of it is complicated, and I probably\nwouldn't understand it. But can you give me as much as you think I can\ndigest?\"\n\nMarshall nodded slowly. \"Ah ... you must understand that psychiatrists\ndiffer,\" he said. \"We appear to run in schools--like fish, which is\nneither here nor there. But what I tell you might not be in accord\nwith a psychiatrist from another school, Sir Kenneth.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"Shoot.\"\n\n\"An extremely interesting slang word, by the way,\" Marshall said.\n\"'Shoot.' Superficially an invitation to violence. I wonder--\" A\nglance from Malone was sufficient. \"Getting back to the track,\nhowever,\" he went on, \"I should begin by saying that Her Majesty\nappears to have suffered a shock of traumatic proportions early in\nlife. That might be the telepathic faculty itself coming to the\nfore--or, rather, the realization that others did not share her\nfaculty. That she was, in fact, in communication with a world which\ncould never reach her on her own deepest and most important level.\" He\npaused. \"Are you following me so far?\" he asked.\n\n\"Gamely,\" Malone admitted. \"In other words, when she couldn't\ncommunicate, she went into this traumatic shock.\"\n\n\"Nor exactly,\" Marshall said. \"We must understand what communication\nis. Basically, Sir Kenneth, we can understand it as a substitute for\nsexual activity. That is, in its deepest sense. It is this attack on\nthe deepest levels of the psychic organism that results in the trauma;\nand has results of its own, by the way, which succeed in stabilizing\nthe traumatic shock on several levels.\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"That last part began to get me a little,\" he said.\n\"Can we go over it again, just the tune this time and leave out the\nharmony?\"\n\nMarshall smiled. \"Certainly,\" he said. \"Remember that Her Majesty has\nbeen locked up in institutions since early adolescence. Because of\nthis--a direct result of the original psychosis--she has been\ndeprived, not only of the communication which serves as a sublimation\nfor sexual activity, but, in fact, any normal sexual activity. Her\nidentification of herself with the Virgin Queen is far from\naccidental, Sir Kenneth.\"\n\nThe idea that conservation was sex was a new and somewhat frightening\none to Malone, but he stuck to it grimly. \"No sex,\" Malone said.\n\"That's the basic trouble.\"\n\nMarshall nodded. \"It always is,\" he said. \"In one form or another, Sir\nKenneth; it is at the root of such problems at all times. But in Her\nMajesty's case the psychosis has become stabilized; she is the Virgin\nQueen, and therefore her failure to become part of the normal sexual\nactivity of her group has a reason. It is accepted on that basis by\nher own psyche.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone said. \"Or, anyhow, I think I do. But how about\nchanges? Could she get worse or better? Could she start lying to\npeople--for the fun of it, or for reasons of her own?\"\n\n\"Changes in her psychic state don't seem very probable,\" Marshall\nsaid. \"In theory, of course, anything is possible; but in fact, I have\nobserved and worked with Her Majesty and no such change has occurred.\nYou may take that as definite.\"\n\n\"And the lying?\" Malone said.\n\nMarshall frowned slightly. \"I've just explained,\" he said, \"that Her\nMajesty has been blocked in the direction of communication--that is,\nin the direction of one of her most important sexual sublimations.\nSuch communication as she can have, therefore, is to be highly\ntreasured by her; it provides the nearest thing to sex that she may\nhave. As the Virgin Queen, she may still certainly _converse_ in any\nway possible. She would not injure that valuable possession and right\nby falsifying it. It's quite impossible, Sir Kenneth. Quite\nimpossible.\"\n\nThis did not make Malone feel any better. It removed one of the two\npossibilities--but it left him with no vacation, and the most\ncomplicated case he had ever dreamed of sitting squarely in his lap\nand making rude faces at him.\n\nHe had to solve the case--and he had nobody but himself to depend on.\n\n\"You're sure?\" he said.\n\n\"Perfectly sure, Sir Kenneth,\" Marshall said.\n\nMalone sighed. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"can I see Her Majesty?\" He knew\nperfectly well that he didn't have to ask Marshall's permission--or\nanybody else's. But it seemed more polite, somehow.\n\n\"She's receiving Dr. Sheldon Lord in audience just at the moment,\"\nMarshall said. \"I don't see why you shouldn't go on to the Throne\nRoom, though. He's giving her some psychological tests, but they ought\nto be finished in a minute or two.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"How about court dress? Got anything here that\nmight fit me?\"\n\nMarshall nodded. \"We've got a pretty complete line of court costume\nnow,\" he said. \"I should say it was the most complete in\nexistence--except possibly for the TV historical companies. Down the\nhall, three doors farther on, you'll find the dressing room.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone thanked Dr. Marshall and went out slowly. He didn't really mind\nthe court dress or the Elizabethan etiquette Her Majesty liked to\npreserve; as a matter of fact, he was rather fond of it. There had\nbeen some complaints about expense when the Throne Room and the\ncostume arrangement were first set up, but the FBI and the Government\nhad finally decided that it was better and easier to humor Her\nMajesty.\n\nMalone spent ten minutes dressing himself magnificently in hose and\ndoublet, slash-sleeved, ermine-trimmed coat, lace collar, and plumed\nhat. By the time he presented himself at the door to the Throne Room\nhe felt almost cheerful. It had been a long time since he had entered\nthe world of Elizabethan knighthood over which Her Majesty held sway,\nand it always made him feel taller and more sure of himself. He bowed\nto a chunkily-built man of medium height in a stiffly brocaded jacket,\ncarrying a small leather briefcase. The man had a whaler's beard of\nblond-red hair that looked slightly out of period, but the costume\nmanaged to overpower it. \"Dr. Lord?\" Malone said.\n\nThe bearded man peered at him. \"Ah, Sir Kenneth,\" he said. \"Yes, yes.\nJust been giving Her Majesty a few tests. Normal weekly check, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"Any change?\"\n\n\"Change?\" Lord said. \"In Her Majesty? Sir Kenneth, you might as well\nexpect the very rocks to change. Her Majesty remains Her Majesty--and\nwill, in all probability, throughout the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\"The same as ever?\" Malone asked hopefully.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Lord said. \"But--if you do want background on the case--I'm\nflying back to New York tonight. Look me up there, if you have a\nchance. I'm afraid there's little information I can give you, but it's\nalways a pleasure to talk with you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said dully.\n\n\"Barrow Street,\" Lord said with a cheery wave of the briefcase.\n\"Number 69.\" He was gone. The Security Officer at the door, a young\nman in the uniform of a page, opened it and peered out at Malone. The\nFBI Agent nodded to him and the Security Officer announced in a firm,\nloud voice: \"Sir Kenneth Malone, of Her Majesty's Own FBI!\"\n\nThe Throne Room was magnificent. The whole place had been done in\nplastic and synthetic fibers to look like something out of the\nSixteenth Century. It was as garish, and as perfect, as a Hollywood\nmovie set--which wasn't surprising, since two stage designers had been\nhired away from color-TV spectaculars to set it up. At the far end of\nthe room, past the rich hangings and the flaming chandeliers, was a\ngreat golden throne, and on it Her Majesty was seated.\n\nLady Barbara Wilson, Her Majesty's personal nurse, was sitting on a\ncamp-chair arrangement nearby. She smiled slowly at Malone as he went\nby, and Malone returned the smile with a good deal of interest. He\nstrode firmly down the long crimson carpet that stretched from the\ndoorway to the throne. At the steps leading up toward the dais that\nheld the Throne, his free hand went up and swept off the plumed hat.\nHe sank to one knee.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said gravely.\n\nThe queen looked down on him. \"Rise, Sir Kenneth,\" she said in a tone\nof surprise. \"We welcome your presence.\"\n\nMalone got up off his knee and stood, his hat in his hand.\n\n\"What is your business with us?\" Her Majesty asked.\n\nMalone looked her full in the face for the first time. He realized\nthat her expression was rather puzzled and worried. She looked even\nmore confused than she had the last time he'd seen her.\n\nHe took a deep breath, wished for a cigar and plunged blindly ahead\ninto the toils of court etiquette.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said, \"I know full well that you are aware of the\nthoughts that I have had concerning the case we have been working on.\nI beg Your Majesty's pardon for having doubted Your Majesty's Royal\nWord. Since my first doubts, of which I am sore ashamed, I have been\ninformed by Our Majesty's Royal Psychiatrist that my doubts were\nill-founded, and I wish to convey my deepest apologies. Now, having\nbeen fully convinced of the truth of Your Majesty's statements, I have\na theory I would discuss with you, the particulars of which you can\ndoubtless see in my mind.\"\n\nHe paused. Her Majesty was staring at him, her face pale.\n\n\"Sir Kenneth,\" she said in a strained voice, \"we appreciate your\nattitude. However--\" She paused for a moment, and then continued.\n\"However, Sir Kenneth, it is our painful duty to inform you--\"\n\nShe stopped again. And when she managed to speak, she had dropped all\npretense of Court Etiquette.\n\n\"Sir Kenneth, I've been so worried! I was afraid you were dead!\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Dead?\" he asked.\n\n\"For the past twenty-four hours,\" Her Majesty said in a frightened\nvoice, \"I've been unable to contact your mind. And right now, as you\nstand there, I can't read anything!\n\n\"It's as though you weren't thinking at all!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nPART 3\n\nIX\n\nMalone stared at Her Majesty for what seemed like a long time. \"Not\nthinking at all?\" he said at last, weakly. \"But I _am_ thinking. At\nleast, I _think_ I am.\" He suddenly felt as if he had gone Ren\u00e9\nDescartes one better. It wasn't a pleasant feeling.\n\nHer Majesty regarded Malone for an interminable, silent second. Then\nshe turned to Lady Barbara. \"My dear,\" she said, \"I would like to\nspeak to Sir Kenneth alone. We will go to my chambers.\"\n\nMalone, feeling as though his brain had suddenly turned to quince\njelly, followed the two women out of a small door at the rear of the\nThrone Room, and into Her Majesty's private apartments. Lady Barbara\nleft them alone with some reluctance, but she'd evidently been getting\nused to following her patient's orders. Which, Malone thought with\nadmiration, must take a lot of effort for a nurse.\n\nThe door closed and he was alone with the Queen. Malone opened his\nmouth to speak, but Her Majesty raised a monitory hand. \"Please, Sir\nKenneth,\" she said. \"Just a moment. Don't say anything for a little\nbit.\"\n\nMalone shut his mouth. When the minute was up, Her Majesty began to\nnod her head, very slowly. Her voice, when she spoke, was low and\ncalm.\n\n\"It's as though you were almost invisible,\" she said. \"I can see you\nwith my eyes, of course, but mentally you are almost completely\nindetectable. Knowing you as well as I do, and being this close to\nyou, it is just possible for me to detect very faint traces of\nactivity.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"I am thinking. I know I am. Maybe\nit's not me. Your telepathy might be fading out temporarily, or\nsomething like that. It's possible, isn't it?\" He was reasonably sure\nit wasn't, but it was a last try at making sense. Her Majesty shook\nher head.\n\n\"I can still receive Sir Thomas, for instance, quite clearly,\" she\nsaid. She seemed a little miffed, but the irritation was overpowered\nby her worry. \"I think, Sir Kenneth, that you just don't know your own\npower, that's all. I don't know how, but you've managed somehow to\nsmother telepathic communication almost completely.\"\n\n\"But not quite?\" Malone said. Apparently, he was thinking, but very\nweakly. Like a small child, he told himself dismally. Like a small\nElizabethan child.\n\nHer Majesty's face took on a look of faraway concentration. \"It's like\nlooking at a very dim light,\" she said, \"a light just at the threshold\nof perception. You might say that you've got to look at such a light\nsideways. If you look directly at it, you can't see it. And, of\ncourse, you can't see it at all if you're a long way off.\" She\nblinked. \"It's not exactly like that, you understand,\" she finished.\n\"But in some ways--\"\n\n\"I get the idea,\" Malone said. \"Or I think I do. But what's causing\nit? Sunspots? Little green men?\"\n\n\"Not so little,\" Her Majesty said with some return of her old humor,\n\"and not green, either. As a matter of fact, _you_ are, Sir Kenneth.\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, shut it again and finally managed to say:\n\"Me?\" in a batlike squeal of surprise.\n\n\"I don't know how, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty went on, \"but you are.\nIt's ... rather frightening to me, as a matter of fact; I've never\nseen such a thing before. I've never even considered it before.\"\n\n\"You?\" Malone said. \"How about me?\" It was like suddenly discovering\nthat you'd been lifting two-hundred-pound barbells and not knowing it.\n\"How could I be doing anything like that without knowing anything\nabout it?\"\n\nHer Majesty shook her head. \"I haven't the faintest idea,\" she said.\n\nBut Malone, very suddenly, did. He remembered deciding to keep a close\ncheck on his mental processes to make sure those bursts of energy\ndidn't do anything to him. Subconsciously, he knew, he was still\nkeeping that watch.\n\nAnd maybe the watch itself caused the complete blanking of his\ntelepathic faculties. It was worth a test, at least, he decided. And\nit was an easy test to make.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said. He told himself that he would now allow\ncommunication between himself and Her Majesty--and only between those\ntwo. Maybe it wasn't possible to let down the barrier in a selective\nway, but he gave it all he had. A long second passed.\n\n\"My goodness!\" Her Majesty said in pleased surprise. \"There you are\nagain!\"\n\n\"You can read me?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"Why ... yes,\" Her Majesty said. \"And I can see just what you're\nthinking. I'm afraid, Sir Kenneth, that I don't know whether it's\nselective or not. But ... oh. Just a minute. You go right on thinking,\nnow, just the way you are.\" Her Majesty's eyes unfocused slightly and\na long time passed, while Malone tried to keep on thinking. But it was\ndifficult, he told himself, to think about things without having any\nthings to think about. He felt his mind begin to spin gently with the\nrhythm of the last sentence, and he considered slowly the possibility\nof thinking about things when there weren't any things thinking about\nyou. That seemed to make as much sense as anything else, and he was\nturning it over and over in his mind when a voice broke in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I was contacting Willie,\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. \"Willie. Of course. Very fine for contacting.\"\n\nHer Majesty frowned. \"You remember Willie, don't you?\" she said.\n\"Willie Logan--who used to be a spy for the Russians, just because he\ndidn't know any better, poor boy?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Logan.\" He remembered the catatonic youngster who\nhad used his telepathic powers against the United States until Her\nMajesty, the FBI, and Kenneth J. Malone had managed to put matters\nright. That had been the first time he'd met Her Majesty; it seemed\nlike fifty years before.\n\n\"Well,\" Her Majesty said, \"Willie and I had a little argument just\nnow. And I think you'll be interested in it.\"\n\n\"I'm fascinated,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Was he thinking about things or were things thinking about him?\"\n\n\"Really, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, \"you do think about the\nsilliest notions when you don't watch yourself.\"\n\nMalone blushed slightly. \"Anyhow,\" he said after a pause, \"what was\nthe argument about?\"\n\n\"Willie says you aren't here,\" Her Majesty said. \"He can't detect you\nat all. Even when I let him take a peek at you through my own\nmind--making myself into sort of a relay station, so to speak--Willie\nwouldn't believe it. He said I was hallucinating.\"\n\n\"Hallucinating me?\" Malone said. \"I think I'm flattered. Not many\npeople would bother.\"\n\n\"Don't underestimate yourself, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, rather\nseverely. \"But you do see what this little argument means, don't you?\nI think you may assume that your telepathic contact is quite\nselective. If Willie can't read you, Sir Kenneth, believe me, nobody\nat all can ... unless you let them.\"\n\nHow he had developed this mental shield, he couldn't imagine, unless\nhis subconscious had done it for him. Good old subconscious, he\nthought, always looking out for a person's welfare, preparing little\nsurprises and things. Though he hoped vaguely that the next surprise,\nif there were a next one, would sneak up a little more gently. Being\ntold flatly that your mind was not in operation was not a very good\nway to start an investigation.\n\nThen he thought of something else. \"Do you think this ... barrier of\nmine will keep out those little bursts of mental energy?\" he said.\n\nHer Majesty looked judicious. \"I really do,\" she said. \"It does appear\nquite impenetrable, Sir Kenneth. I can't understand how you're doing\nit. Or why, for that matter.\"\n\n\"Well--\" Malone began.\n\nHer Majesty raised a hand. \"No,\" she said. \"I'd rather not know, if\nyou please.\" Her voice was stern, but just a little shaken. \"The\nthought of blocking off thought--the only real form of communication\nthat exists--is, frankly, quite horrible to me. I would rather be\nblinded, Sir Kenneth. I truly would.\"\n\nMalone thought of Dr. Marshall and blushed. Her Majesty peered at him\nnarrowly, and then smiled.\n\n\"You've been talking to my Royal Psychiatrist again, haven't you?\" she\nsaid. Malone nodded. \"Frankly, Sir Kenneth,\" she went on, \"I think\npeople pay too much attention to that sort of thing nowadays.\"\n\nThe subject, Malone recognized, was firmly closed. He cleared his\nthroat and started up another topic. \"Let's talk about these energy\nbursts,\" he said. \"Do you still pick them up occasionally?\"\n\n\"Oh, my, yes,\" Her Majesty said. \"And it's not only me. Willie has\nbeen picking them up too. We've had some long talks about it, Willie\nand I. It's frightening, in a way, but you must admit that it's very\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Malone muttered. \"Tell me, have you figured out what\nthey might be, yet?\"\n\nHer Majesty shook her head. \"All we know is that they do seem to occur\njust before a person intends to make a decision. The burst somehow\nappears to influence the decision. But we don't know how, and we don't\nknow where they come from, or what causes them. Or even why.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" Malone said, \"we know absolutely nothing new.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"But Willie and I do\nintend to keep working on it. It is important, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Important,\" Malone said, \"is not the word.\" He paused. \"And now, if\nyour Majesty will excuse me,\" he said, \"I'll have to go. I have work\nto do, and your information has been most helpful.\"\n\n\"You may go, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, returning with what\nappeared to be real pleasure to the etiquette of the Elizabethan\nCourt. \"We are grateful that you have done so much, and continue to do\nso much, to defend the peace of Our Realm.\"\n\n\"I pledge myself to continue in those efforts which please Your\nMajesty,\" Malone said, and started back for the costume room. Once\nhe'd changed into his regular clothing again he snapped himself back\nto the room he had rented in the Great Universal. He had a great deal\nof thinking to do, he told himself, and not much time to do it in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHowever, he was alone. That meant he could light up a cigar--something\nwhich, as an FBI Agent, he didn't feel he should do in public. Cigars\njust weren't right for FBI Agents, though they were all right for\nordinary detectives like Malone's father. As a matter of fact, he\nconsidered briefly hunting up a vest, putting it on and letting the\ncigar ash dribble over it. His father seemed to have gotten a lot of\ngood ideas that way. But, in the end, he rejected the notion as being\ntoo complicated, and merely sat back in a chair, with an ashtray\nconveniently on a table by his side, and smoked and thought.\n\nNow, he knew with reasonable certainty that Andrew J. Burris was wrong\nand that he, Malone, was right. The source of all the confusion in the\ncountry was due to psionics, not to psychodrugs and Walt Disney spies.\n\nHis first idea was to rush back and tell Burris. However, this looked\nlike a useless move, and every second he thought about it made it seem\nmore useless. He simply didn't have enough new evidence to convince\nBurris of anything whatever; psychiatric evidence was fine to back up\nsomething else, but on its own it was still too shaky to be accepted\nby the courts, in most cases. And Burris thought even more strictly\nthan the courts in such matters.\n\nNot only that, Malone realized with alarm, but even if he did manage\nsomehow to convince Burris there was very little chance that Burris\nwould stay convinced. If his mind could be changed by a burst of wild\nmental power--and why not? Malone reflected--then he could be\nunconvinced as often as necessary. He could be spun round and round\nlike a top and never end up facing the way Malone needed him to face.\n\nThat left the burden of solving the problem squatting like a\nhunchback's hunch squarely on Malone's shoulders. He thought he could\nbear the weight for a while, if he could only think of some way of\ndislodging it. But the idea of its continuing to squat there forever\nwas horribly unnerving. \"Quasimodo Malone,\" he muttered, and uttered a\nbrief prayer of thanks that his father had been spared a classical\neducation. \"Ken\" wasn't so bad. \"Quasi\" would have been awful.\n\nHe couldn't think of any way to get a fingerhold on the thing that\nweighed him down. Slowly, he went over it in his mind.\n\nSituation: an unidentifiable something is attacking the United States\nwith an untraceable something else from a completely unknown source.\n\nProblem: how do you go about latching on to anything as downright\nnonexistent as all that?\n\nEven the best detective, Malone told himself irritably, needed clues\nof some kind. And this thing, whatever it was, was not playing fair.\nIt didn't go around leaving bloody fingerprints or lipsticked\ncigarette butts or packets of paper matches with _Ciro's, Hollywood_,\nwritten on them. It didn't even have an alibi for anything that could\nbe cracked, or leave tire marks or footprints behind that could be\nphotographed. Hell, Malone thought disgustedly, it wasn't that the\ntrail was cold. It just _wasn't_.\n\nOf course, there were ways to get clues, he reflected. He thought of\nhis father. His father would have gone to the scene of the crime, or\nquestioned some of the witnesses. But the scene of the crime was\nanywhere and everywhere, and most of the witnesses didn't know they\nwere witnessing anything. Except for Her Majesty, of course--but he'd\nalready questioned her, and there hadn't been any clues he could\nrecall in that conversation.\n\nMalone stubbed out his cigar, lit another one absent-mindedly, and\nrescued his tie, which was working its slow way around to the side of\nhis collar. There were, he remembered, three classic divisions of any\ncrime: method, motive and opportunity. Maybe thinking about those\nwould lead somewhere.\n\nAs an afterthought, he got up, found a pencil and paper with the\nhotel's name stamped on them in gold and came back to the chair.\nClearing the ashtray aside, he put the paper on the table and divided\nthe paper into three vertical columns with the pencil. He headed the\nfirst one _Method_, the second _Motive_ and the third _Opportunity_.\n\nHe stared at the paper for a while, and decided with some trepidation\nto take the columns one by one. Under _Method_, he put down: \"Little\nbursts. Who knows cause?\" Some more thought gave him another item, and\nhe set it down under the first one: \"Psionic. Look for psionic\npeople?\"\n\nThat apparently was all there was to the first column. After a while\nhe moved to number two, _Motive_. \"Confuse things,\" he wrote with\nscarcely a second's reflection. But that didn't seem like enough. A\nfew minutes more gave him several other items, written down one under\nthe other. \"Disrupt entire US. Set US up for invasion? Martians?\nRussians? CK: Is Russia having trble?\" That seemed to exhaust the\nsubject and with some relief he went on. But the title of the next\ncolumn nearly stopped him completely.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n_Opportunity._ There wasn't anything he could put down under that one,\nMalone told himself, until he knew a great deal more about method. As\nthings stood at present, the best entry under _Opportunity_ was a\nlarge, tastefully done question mark. He made one, and then sat back\nto look at the entire list and see what help it gave him:\n\n_Method_\nLittle bursts. Who knows cause?\nPsionic. Look for psionic people?\n\n_Motive_\nConfuse things.\nDisrupt entire US.\nSet US up for invasion?\nMartians?\nRussians?\nCK: Is Russia having trble?\n\n_Opportunity_\n?\n\nSomehow, it didn't seem to be much help, when he thought about it. It\nhad a lot of information on it, but none of the information seemed to\nlead anywhere. It did seem to be established that the purpose was to\nconfuse or disrupt the United States, but this didn't seem to point to\nanybody except a Russian, an alien or a cosmic practical joker. Malone\ncould see no immediate way of deciding among the trio. However, he\ntold himself, there are other ways to start investigating a crime.\nThere must be.\n\nPsychological methods, for instance. People had little gray cells, he\nremembered from his childhood reading. Some of the more brainy\nfictional detectives never stooped to anything so low as an actual\nphysical clue. They concentrated solely on finding a pattern in the\ncrimes that indicated, infallibly, the psychology of the individual.\nOnce his psychology had been identified, it was only a short step to\nactually catching him and putting him in jail until his psychology\nchanged for the better. Or, of course, until it disappeared entirely\nand was buried, along with the rest of him, in a small wood box.\n\nThat wasn't Malone's affair. All he had to do was take the first few\nsteps and actually find the man. And perhaps psychology and pattern\nwas the place to start. Anyhow, he reflected, he didn't have any other\nmethod that looked even remotely likely to lead to anything except\nbrain-fag, disappointment, and catalepsy.\n\nBut he didn't have enough cases to find a pattern. There must, he\nthought, be a way to get some more. After a few seconds he thought of\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first he thought of asking Room Service for all the local and\nout-of-state papers, but that, he quickly saw, was a little unwise.\nPeople didn't come to Las Vegas to catch up on the news; they came to\nget away from it. A man might read Las Vegas papers, and possibly even\nhis home town's paper if he couldn't break himself of the pernicious\nhabit. But nobody on vacation would start reading papers from\neverywhere.\n\nThere was no sense in causing suspicion, Malone told himself. Instead,\nhe reached for the phone and called the desk.\n\n\"Great Universal, good afternoon,\" a pleasant voice said in his ear.\n\nMalone blinked. \"What time _is_ it?\" he said.\n\n\"A few minutes before six,\" the voice said. \"In the evening, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. It was later than he'd thought; the list had taken\nsome time. \"This is Kenneth J. Malone,\" he went on, \"in Room--\" He\ntried to remember the number of his room and failed. It seemed like\nfour or five days since he'd entered it. \"Well, wherever I am,\" he\nsaid at last, \"send up some kind of a car for me and have a taxi\nwaiting outside.\"\n\nThe voice sounded unperturbed. \"Right away, sir,\" it said. \"Will there\nbe anything else?\"\n\n\"I guess not,\" Malone said. \"Not now, anyhow.\" He hung up and stubbed\nout the latest in his series of cigars.\n\nThe hallway car arrived in a few minutes. It was manned by a muscular\nlittle man with beady eyes and thinning black hair. \"You Malone?\" he\nsaid when the FBI Agent opened the door.\n\n\"Kenneth J.,\" Malone said. \"I called for a car.\"\n\n\"Right outside, Chief,\" the little man said in a gravelly voice. \"Just\nhop in and off we go into the wild blue yonder. Right?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Malone said helplessly. He followed the man outside,\nlocked his door and climbed into a duplicate of the little car that\nhad taken him to his room in the first place.\n\n\"Step right in, Chief,\" the little man said. \"We're off.\"\n\nMalone, overcoming an immediate distaste for the chummy little fellow,\nclimbed in and the car retreated down to the road. It started off\nsmoothly and they went back toward the lobby. The little man chatted\nincessantly and Malone tried not to listen. But there was nothing else\nto do except watch the gun-toting \"guides\" as the car passed them, and\nthe sight was making him nervous.\n\n\"You want anything--special,\" the driver said, giving Malone a blow in\nthe ribs that was apparently meant to be subtle, \"you just ask for\nMurray. Got it?\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" Malone said wearily.\n\n\"You just pick up the little phone and you ask for Murray,\" the driver\nsaid. \"Maybe you want something a little out of the ordinary--get what\nI mean?\" Malone moved aside, but not fast enough, and Murray's stone\nelbow caught him again. \"Something special, extra-nice. For my\nfriends, pal. You want to be a friend of mine?\"\n\nAssurances that friendship with Murray was Malone's dearest ambition\nin life managed to fend off further blows until the car pulled to a\nstop in the lobby. \"Cab's outside, Mr. Malone,\" Murray said. \"You\nremember me--hey?\"\n\n\"I will never, never forget you,\" Malone said fervently, and got out\nin a hurry. He found the cab and the driver, a heavy-set man with a\nface that looked as if, somewhere along the line, it had run into a\nWaring Blendor and barely escaped, swiveled around to look at him as\nhe got in.\n\n\"Where to, Mac?\" he asked sourly.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Center of town,\" he said. \"A nice big newsstand.\"\n\nThe cabbie blinked. \"A what?\" he said.\n\n\"Newsstand,\" Malone said pleasantly. \"All right with you?\"\n\n\"Everybody's a little crazy, I guess,\" the cabbie said. \"But why do I\nalways get the real nuts?\" He started the cab with a savage jerk and\nMalone was carried along the road at dizzying speed. They managed to\nmake ten blocks before the cab squealed to a stop. Malone peered out\nand saw a nice selection of sawhorses piled up in the road, guarded by\ntwo men with guns. The men were dressed in police uniforms and the\ncabby, staring at them, uttered one brief and impolite word.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Roadblock,\" the cabbie said. \"Thing's going to stay here until Hell\nfreezes over. Not that they need it. Hell, I passed it on the way in\nbut I figured they'd take it down pretty quick.\"\n\n\"Roadblock?\" Malone said. \"What for?\"\n\nThe cabbie shrugged eloquently. \"Who knows?\" he said. \"You ask\nquestions, you might get answers you don't like. I don't ask\nquestions, I live longer.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nThe cops, meanwhile, had advanced toward the car. One of them looked\nin. \"Who's the passenger?\" he said.\n\nThe cabbie swore again. \"You want me to take loyalty oaths from\npeople?\" he said. \"You want to ruin my business? I got a passenger,\nhow do I know who he is? Maybe he's the Lone Ranger.\"\n\n\"Don't get funny,\" the cop said. His partner had gone around to the\nback of the car.\n\n\"What's this, the trunk again?\" the cabbie said. \"You think maybe I'm\nsmuggling in showgirls from the edge of town?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha,\" the cop said distinctly. \"One more joke and it's thirty\ndays, buster. Just keep cool and nothing will happen.\"\n\n\"Nothing, he calls it,\" the cabbie said dismally. But he stayed silent\nuntil the second cop came back to rejoin his partner.\n\n\"Clean,\" he said.\n\n\"Here, too, I guess,\" the first cop said, and looked in again. \"You,\"\nhe said to Malone. \"You a tourist?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"Kenneth J. Malone, at the Great\nUniversal. Arrived this afternoon. What's happening here, officer?\"\n\n\"I'm asking questions,\" the cop said. \"You're answering them. Outside\nof that, you don't have to know a thing.\" He looked very tough and\nofficial. Malone didn't say anything else.\n\nAfter a few more seconds they went back to their positions and the\ncabbie started the car again. Ten yards past the roadblock he turned\naround and looked at Malone. \"It's the sheriff's office every time,\"\nhe said. \"Now, you take a State cop, he's O.K. because what does he\ncare? He's got other things to worry about, he don't have to bear down\non hard-working cabbies.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said helpfully.\n\n\"And the city police--they're right here in the city, they're O.K. I\nknow them, they know me, nothing goes wrong. Get what I mean?\"\n\n\"The sheriff's office is the worst, though?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The worst is nothing compared to those boys,\" the cabbie said.\n\"Believe me, every time they can make life tough for a cabbie, they do\nit. It's hatred, that's what it is. They hate cabbies. That's the\nsheriff's office for you.\"\n\n\"Tough,\" Malone said. \"But the roadblock--what _was_ it for, anyhow?\"\n\nThe cabbie looked back at the road, avoided an oncoming car with a\ncasual sweep of the wheel, and sighed gustily. \"Mister,\" he said, \"you\ndon't ask questions, I don't give out answers. Fair?\"\n\nThere was, after all, nothing else to say. \"Fair,\" Malone told him,\nand rode the rest of the way in total silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBuying the papers in Las Vegas took more time than Malone had\nbargained for. He had to hunt from store to store to get a good,\nrepresentative selection, and there were crowds almost everywhere\nplaying the omnipresent slot-machines. The whir of the machines and\nthe low undertones and whispers of the bettors combined in the air to\nmake what Malone considered the single most depressing sound he had\never heard. It sounded like a factory, old, broken-down and unwanted,\nthat was geared only to the production of cigarette butts and old\ncellophane, ready-crumpled for throwing away. Malone pushed through\nthe crowds as fast as possible, but nearly an hour had gone by when he\nhad all his papers and hailed another cab to get him back to the\nhotel.\n\nThis time, the cabbie had a smiling, shining face. He looked like\nPollyanna, after eight or ten shots at the middleweight title. Malone\nbeamed right back at him and got in. \"Great Universal,\" he said.\n\n\"Hey, that's a nice place,\" the cabbie said heartily, as they started\noff. \"I heard there was a couple TV stars there last week and they got\ndrunk and had a fight. You see that?\"\n\n\"Just arrived this afternoon,\" Malone said. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry,\" the cabbie assured him. \"Something's always going\non at the Universal. I hear they posted a lot of guards there, just\nwaiting for something to come up now. Something about some shooting,\nbut I didn't get the straight story yet. That true?\"\n\n\"Far as I know,\" Malone said. \"There's a lot of strange things\nhappening lately, aren't there?\"\n\n\"Lots,\" the cabbie said eagerly. He meandered slowly around a couple\nof bright-red convertibles. \"A guy owned the _Last Stand_, he killed\nhimself with a gun today. It's in the papers. Listen, Mister, funny\nthings happen all the time around here. I remember last week there was\na lady in my cab, nice old bat, looked like she wouldn't take off an\nearring in public, not among strangers. You know the type. Well, sir,\nshe asked me to take her on to the Golden Palace, and that's a fair\nride. So on the way down, she--\"\n\nFascinated as he was by the unreeling story of the shy old bat, Malone\ninterrupted. \"I hear there's a roadblock up now, and they're searching\nall the cars. Know anything about that?\"\n\nThe cabbie nodded violently. \"Sure, Mister,\" he said. \"Now, it's funny\nyou should ask. I hit the block once today and I was saying to myself,\nI'll bet somebody's going to ask me about this. So when I was in town\nI talked around with Si Deeds ... you know Si? Oh, no, you just\narrived today ... anyhow, I figured Si would know.\"\n\n\"And did he?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" the cabbie said. Malone sighed disgustedly and the\ncabbie went on: \"So I went over and talked to Bob Grindell. I figured,\nthere was action, Bob would know. And guess what?\"\n\n\"He didn't know either,\" Malone said tiredly.\n\n\"Bob?\" the cabbie said. \"Say, Mister, you must be new here for sure,\nif you say Bob wouldn't know what was going on. Why, Bob knows more\nabout this town than guys lived in it twice as long, I'll tell you.\nBelieve me, he knows.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\" Malone asked.\n\nThe cabbie paused. \"About what?\" he said.\n\n\"About the roadblock,\" Malone said distinctly.\n\n\"Oh,\" the cabbie said. \"That. Well, that was a funny thing and no\nmistake. There was this fight, see? And Shellenberger got in the\nmiddle of it, see? So when he was dead they had to set up this\nroadblock.\"\n\nMalone restrained himself with some difficulty. \"What fight?\" he said.\n\"And who's Shellenberger? And how did he get in the way?\"\n\n\"Mister,\" the cabbie said, \"you must be new here.\"\n\n\"A remarkable guess,\" Malone said.\n\nThe cabbie nodded. \"Sure must be,\" he said. \"Gus Shellenberger's lived\nhere over ten years now. I drove him around many's the time. Remember\nwhen he used to go out to this motel out on the outskirts there; there\nwas this doll he was interested in but it never came to much. He said\nshe wasn't right for his career, you know how guys like that are, they\ngot to be careful all the time. Never hit the papers or anything--I\nmean with the doll and all--but people get to know things. You know.\nSo with this doll--\"\n\n\"How long ago did all this happen?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"The doll?\" the cabbie said. \"Oh, five-six years. Maybe seven. I\nremember it was the year I got a new cab, business was pretty good,\nyou know. Seven, I guess. Garage made me a price, you know, I had to\nbe an idiot to turn it down? A nice price. Well, George Lamel who owns\nthe place, he's an old friend, you know? I did him some favors so he\ngives me a nice price. Well, this new cab--\"\n\n\"Can we get back to the present for a little while?\" Malone said.\n\"There was this fight, and your friend Gus Shellenberger got involved\nin it somehow--\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" the cabbie said. \"Oh, sure. Well, there was a kind of\nchase. Some sheriff's officers were looking for an escaped convict,\nand they were chasing him and doing some shooting. And Shellenberger,\nhe got in the way and got shot accidentally. The criminal, he got\naway. But it's kind of a mess, because--\"\n\nA loud chorus of sirens effectively stopped all conversation. Two cars\nstamped with the insignia of the sheriff's office came into sight and\nstreaked past, headed for Las Vegas.\n\n\"Because Shellenberger was State's attorney, after all,\" the cabbie\nsaid. \"It's not like just anybody got killed.\"\n\n\"And the roadblock?\" Malone said.\n\n\"For the criminal, I guess,\" the cabbie said.\n\nMalone nodded heavily. The whole thing smelled rather loudly, he\nthought. The \"accident\" wasn't very plausible to start with. And a\nsearch for an escaped criminal that didn't even involve checking\nidentification of strangers like Malone wasn't much of a search. The\ncops knew who they were looking for.\n\nAnd Shellenberger hadn't been killed by accident.\n\nThe roadblock was down, he noticed. The sheriff's office cars had\napparently carried the cheerful cops back to Las Vegas. Maybe they'd\nfound their man, Malone thought, and maybe they just didn't care any\nmore.\n\n\"Wouldn't a State's attorney live in Carson City?\" he asked after a\nwhile.\n\n\"Not old Gus Shellenberger,\" the cabbie said. \"Many's the time I\ntalked with him and he said he loved this old town. Loved it. Like an\nold friend. Why, he used to say to me--\"\n\nAt that point the Great Universal hove into view. Malone felt\nextraordinarily grateful to see it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went to his room with the bundle of papers in his hand and locked\nhimself in. He lit a fresh cigar and started through the papers. Las\nVegas was the one on top, and he gave it a quick going-over. Sure\nenough, the suicide of the Golden Palace owner was on page one, along\nwith a lot of other local news.\n\n_Mayor Resigns Under Council Pressure_, one headline read. On page 3\nanother story was headlined: _County Attorney Indicted by Grand Jury\nin Bribery Case_. And at the bottom of page 1, complete with pictures\nof baffled phone operators and linemen, was a double column spread:\n_Damage to Phone Relay Station Isolates City Five Hours_.\n\nCarson City, the State Capitol, came in for lots of interesting news,\ntoo. Three headlines caught Malone's attention:\n\n     LT.-GOVERNOR MORRIS SWORN IN AS GOVERNOR TWELVE MEMBERS OF\n     LEGISLATURE RESIGN\n\n     Ill Health Given As Reason\n\n     STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: \"NO COMMENT\" ON RACKETS\n     CONNECTION CHARGE.\n\nThe next paper was the New York Post. Malone studied the front page\nwith interest:\n\n     MAYOR ORDERS ARREST OF POLICE COMM.\n\nThe story on page 3 had a little more detail:\n\n     MAYOR AMALFI ORDERS ARREST OF POLICE COMMISSIONER ON\n     EVIDENCE SHOWING \"COLLUSION WITH GAMBLING INTERESTS\"\n\nBut Malone didn't have time to read the story. Other headlines on\npages 2 and 3 attracted his startled attention:\n\n     TWELVE DIE IN BROOKLYN GANG MASSACRE\n\n     Ricardo, Numbers Head, Among Slain\n\n     \"DANGEROUS DAN\" SUGRUE LINKED WITH TRUCKER'S UNION\n\n     Admits Connection \"Gladly\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n     HOUSING AUTHORITY DENIES, THEN CONFESSES GRAFT CHARGE\n\nMalone wiped a streaming brow. Apparently all hell was busting loose.\nUnder the _Post_ was the San Francisco _Examiner_, its crowded front\npage filled with all sorts of strange and startling news items. Malone\nlooked over a few at random. A wildcat waterfront strike had been\ncalled off after the resignation of the union local's president. The\n\"Nob Hill Mob,\" which had grown notorious in the past few years, had\nbeen rounded up and captured _in toto_ after what the paper described\nonly as a \"police tipoff.\" Two headlines caught his special attention:\n\n     BERSERK POLICE CAPTAIN KILLS TWO AIDES, SELF: CORRUPTION\n     HINTED\n\nThe second hit closer to home:\n\n     FBI ARRESTS THREE STATE SENATORS ON INCOME TAX CHARGE\n\nMalone felt a pang of nostalgia. Conquering it after a brief struggle,\nhe went on to the next paper. From Los Angeles, its front page showed\nthat Hollywood, at least, was continuing to hold its own:\n\n     LAVISH FUNERAL PLANNED FOR WONDER DOG TOMORROW\n\nBut the Washington _Times-Herald_ brought things back to the mess\nMalone had expected. All sorts of things were going on:\n\n     PRESIDENT ACCEPTS RESIGNATION OF THREE CABINET MEMBERS\n\n     New Appointees Not Yet Named\n\n     PENTAGON TO INVESTIGATE QUARTER-MASTER CORPS GRAFT\n\n     Revelations Hinted In Closed Hearing Thursday\n\n     RIOT ON SENATE FLOOR QUELLED BY GUARDS\n\n     Sen. Briggs Hospitalized\n\n     GENERAL BREGER, MISSILE BASE HEAD, DIES IN TESTING ACCIDENT\n\n     Faulty Equipment Blamed\n\nMalone put the papers down with a deep sigh. There was some kind of a\npattern there, he was sure; there had to be. More was happening in the\ngood old United States inside of twenty-four hours than ordinarily\nhappened in a couple of months. The big trouble was that some of it\nwas, doubtless, completely unconnected with the work of Malone's\npsychological individual. It was equally certain that some of it\nwasn't; no normal workings of chance could account for the spate of\nresignations, deaths, arrests of high officials, freak accidents and\neverything else he'd just seen.\n\nBut there was no way of telling which was which. The only one he was\nreasonably sure he could leave out of his calculations was Hollywood's\ngood old Wonder Dog. And when he looked at the rest all he could see\nwas that confusion was rampant. Which was exactly what he'd known\nbefore.\n\nHe remembered once, when he was a boy, his mother had taken him to an\nastronomical observatory, and he had looked at Mars through the big\ntelescope, hoping to see the canals he'd heard so much about. Sure,\nenough, there had been a blurred pattern of some kind. It might have\nrepresented canals--but he'd been completely unable to trace any given\nline. It was like looking at a spiderweb through a sheet of frosted\nglass.\n\nHe needed a clearer view, and there wasn't any way to get it without\nfinding some more information. Sooner or later, he told himself,\neverything would fall into one simple pattern, and he would give a cry\nof \"Eureka!\"\n\nThere was, at any rate, no need to go to the scene of the crime. He\nwas right in the middle of it--and would have been, apparently, no\nmatter where he'd been. The big question was: where were all the facts\nhe needed?\n\nHe certainly wasn't going to find them all alone in his room, he\ndecided. Mingling with the Las Vegas crowds might give him some sort\nof a lead--and, besides, he had to act like a man on vacation, didn't\nhe? Satisfied of this, Malone began to change into his dress suit.\nPeople who came to Las Vegas, he told himself while fiddling with what\nseemed to be a left-hand-thread cufflink of a peculiarly nasty\ndisposition, were usually rich. Rich people would be worried about the\nway the good old United States was acting up, just like anybody else,\nbut they'd have access to various sources both of information and\nrumor. Rumor was more valuable than might at first appear, Malone\nthought sententiously, sneaking up on the cufflink and fastening it\nsecurely. He finished dressing with what was almost an air of hope.\n\nHe surveyed himself in the mirror when he was done. Nobody, he told\nhimself with some assurance, would recognize him as the FBI Agent who\nhad come into the Golden Palace two years before, clad in Elizabethan\ncostume and escorting a Queen who had turned out to be a phenomenal\npoker player. After all, Las Vegas was a town in which lots of strange\nthings happened daily, and he was dressed differently, and he'd aged\nat least two years in the intervening two years.\n\nHe put in a call for a hallway car--carefully refraining from asking\nfor Murray.\n\n\nX\n\n\"Business, Mr. Malone,\" the bartender said, \"is shot all to hell. The\nwhole country is shot all to hell.\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure,\" the bartender said. He finished polishing one glass and set to\nwork on another one. \"Look at the place,\" he went on. \"Half full. You\nbeen here two weeks now, and you know how business was when you came.\nNow look.\"\n\nIt wasn't necessary, but Malone turned obediently to survey the huge\ngambling hall. It was roofed over by a large golden dome that seemed\nto make the place look even emptier than it could possibly be. There\nwere still plenty of people around the various tables, and something\napproaching a big crowd clustered around the _chemin de fer_ layout.\nBut it was possible to breathe in the place, and even move from table\nto table without stepping into anybody's pocket. Las Vegas was\ndefinitely sliding downhill at the moment, Malone thought.\n\nThe glitter of polished gold and silver ornaments, the low cries of\nthe various dealers and officials, the buzz of conversation, were all\nthe same. But under the great dome, Malone told himself sadly, you\ncould almost see the people leaving, one by one.\n\n\"No money around either,\" the bartender said. \"Except maybe for a few\nguys like yourself. I mean, people take their chances at the wheel or\nthe tables, but there's no big betting going on, just nickel-dime\nstuff. And no big spending, either. Used to be tips in a place like\nthis, just tips, would really mount up to something worth while. Now,\nnothing.\" He put the glass and towel down and leaned across the bar.\n\"You know what I think, Mr. Malone?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said politely. \"What do you think?\"\n\nThe bartender looked portentous. \"I think all the big-money guys have\nrushed off home to look after their business and like that,\" he said,\n\"everything's going to hell, and what I want to know is: What's wrong\nwith the country? You're a big businessman, Mr. Malone. You ought to\nhave some ideas.\"\n\nMalone paused and looked thoughtful. \"I'll tell you what I think,\" he\nsaid. \"I think people have decided that gambling is sinful. Maybe we\nall ought to go and get our souls dry-cleaned.\"\n\nThe bartender shook his head. \"You always got a little joke, Mr.\nMalone,\" he said. \"It's what I like about you. But there must be some\nreason for what's happening.\"\n\n\"There must be,\" Malone agreed. \"But I'll be double-roasted for extra\nfresh flavor if I know what it is.\"\n\nHis vacation pay, he told himself with a feeling of downright misery,\nwas already down the drain. He'd been dipping into personal savings to\nkeep up his front as a big spender, but that couldn't go on\nforever--even though he saved money on the front by gambling very\nlittle while he tipped lavishly. And in spite of what he'd spent he\nwas no closer to an answer than he had been when he'd started.\n\n\"Now, you take the stock market,\" the bartender said, picking up the\nglass and towel again and starting to work in a semiautomatic fashion.\n\"It's going up and down like a regular roller coaster. I know because\nI got a few little things going for me there--nothing much, you\nunderstand, but I keep an eye out for developments. It doesn't make\nany sense, Mr. Malone. Even the financial columnists can't make sense\nout of it.\"\n\n\"Terrible,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And the Government's been cracking down on business everywhere it\ncan,\" the bartender went on. \"All kinds of violations. I got nothing\nagainst the law, you understand. But that kind of thing don't help\nprofits any. Look at the Justice Department.\"\n\n\"You look at it,\" Malone muttered.\n\n\"No,\" the bartender said. \"I mean it. They been arresting people all\nover the place for swindling on Government contracts, and falsifying\ntax records, and graft, and all kinds of things. Listen, every FBI man\nin the country must be up to his cute little derby hat in work.\"\n\n\"I'll bet they are,\" Malone said. He heaved a great sigh. Every one of\nthem except Kenneth J. Malone was probably hopping full time in an\neffort to straighten out the complicated mess everything was getting\ninto. Of course, he was working, too--but not officially. As far as\nthe FBI knew, he was on vacation, and they were perfectly willing to\nlet him stay there.\n\nA nationwide emergency over two weeks old, and getting worse all the\ntime--and Burris hadn't even so much as called Malone to talk about\nthe weather. He'd said that Malone was one of his top operatives, but\nnow that trouble was really piling up there wasn't a peep out of him.\n\nThe enemy, whoever they were, were doing a great job, Malone thought\nbitterly. Every time Burris decided he might need Malone, apparently,\nthey pushed a little mental burst at him and turned him around again.\nHe could just picture Burris looking blankly at an FBI roster and\nsaying: \"Malone? Who's he?\"\n\nIt wasn't a nice picture. Malone took a deep swallow of his\nbourbon-and-water and tried forgetting about it. The bartender, called\nby another customer, put the glass and towel down and went to the\nother end of the bar. Malone finished his drink very slowly, feeling\nmore lonely than he could ever remember being before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last, though, four-thirty rolled around and he got up from the\nplush bar stool and headed for the Universal Joint, the hotel's big\nshow-room. It was one of the few places in the hotel that was easily\nreachable from the front bar on foot, and Malone walked, taking an\nunexpected pleasure in this novel form of locomotion. In a few minutes\nhe was at the great curtained front doors.\n\nHe pushed them open. Later, of course, when the Universal Joint was\nopen to the public, a man in a uniform slightly more impressive than\nthat of a South American generalissimo would be standing before the\ndoors to save patrons the unpleasant necessity of opening them for\nthemselves. But now, in the afternoon, the Universal Joint was closed.\nThere was no one inside but Primo Palveri, the manager and majority\nstockholder of the Great Universal, and the new strip act he was\nwatching. Malone didn't particularly like the idea of sharing his\nconversation with a burlesque stripper, but there was little he could\ndo about it; he'd waited several days for the appointment already.\n\nAs the doors opened he could hear a nasal voice, almost without\nover-tones, saying: \"Now turn around, baby. Turn around.\" A pause, and\nthen another voice, this one female:\n\n\"Is this all right, Mr. Palveri? You want me to show you something\nelse?\"\n\nMalone shut the door quietly behind him. The female voice was coming\nfrom the throat of a semi-naked girl about five feet eight, with\nbright red hair and a wide, wide smile. She was staring at a chunky\nlittle black-haired man sunk in a chair, whose back was to Malone.\n\n\"What else do you do, Sweetheart?\" the chunky man said. \"Let me see\nwhatever you do. I want some wide-talent stuff, you know, for the\nplace. Class.\"\n\nThe girl smiled even wider. Malone was sure her teeth were about to\nfall out onto the floor, probably in a neat arrangement that spelled\nout _Will You Kiss Me In The Dark Baby_. That would take an awful lot\nof teeth, he reflected, but the stripper looked as if she could manage\nthe job. \"I dance and sing,\" she said. \"I could do a dance for you,\nbut my music is upstairs. You want me to go and get it?\"\n\nPalveri shook his head. \"How about a song, baby? You mind singing\nwithout a piano?\"\n\n\"I don't have anything prepared,\" the girl said, her eyes wide. \"I\ndidn't know this was going to be a special audition. I thought, you\nknow, just a burlesque audition, so I didn't bring anything.\"\n\nPalveri sank a little lower in the chair. \"O.K., Sweetheart,\" he said.\n\"You got a nice shape, you'll fit in the line anyhow. But just sing a\nsong you know. How about that? If you make it with that, you could get\nyourself a featured spot. More dough.\"\n\nThe girl appeared to consider this proposition. \"Gee,\" she said\nslowly. \"I could do 'God Bless America'. O.K., Mr. Palveri?\"\n\nThe chunky man sank even deeper toward the floor. \"Never mind,\" he\nsaid. \"Go get dressed, tell Tony you got the number five spot in the\nline. O.K.?\"\n\n\"Gee,\" she said. \"Maybe I could work on something and do it for you\nsome other time, Mr. Palveri?\"\n\nHe nodded wearily. \"Some other time,\" he said. \"Sure.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl went off through a door at the left of the club. Malone\nthreaded his way past tables with chairs piled on top of them until he\ncame to Palveri's side. The club owner was sitting on a single chair\ndragged off the heap that stood on a table next to him. He didn't turn\naround. \"Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"take another chair, sit down and we'll\ntalk. O.K.?\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"How'd you know I was there?\" he said. \"Much less who\nI was?\"\n\n\"In this business,\" Palveri said, still without turning, \"you learn to\nnotice things, Mr. Malone. I heard you come in and wait. Who else\nwould you be?\"\n\nMalone took a chair from the pile and set it up next to Palveri's. The\nchunky man turned to face him for the first time. Malone took a deep\nbreath and tried to look hard and tough as he studied the club owner.\n\nPalveri had small, sunken eyes decorated with bluish bags below and\ntufted black eyebrows above. The eyes were very cold. The rest of his\nface didn't warm things up any; he had an almost lipless slash for a\nmouth, a small reddish nose and cheeks that could have used either a\nshave or a good sandblasting job.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You said you wanted to see me,\" Palveri began after a second. \"But\nyou didn't say what about. What's up, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"I've been looking around,\" Malone said in what he hoped was a grim,\nno-nonsense tone. \"Checking things. You know.\"\n\n\"Checking?\" Palveri said. \"What's this about?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. He fished out a cigarette and lit it. \"Castelnuovo in\nChicago sent me down,\" he said. \"I've been doing some checking around\nfor him.\"\n\nPalveri's eyes narrowed slightly. Malone puffed on the cigarette and\ntried to act cool. \"You throwing names around to impress me?\" the club\nowner said at last.\n\n\"I'm not throwing names around,\" Malone said grimly. \"Castelnuovo\nwants me to look around, that's all.\"\n\n\"Castelnuovo's a big man in Chicago,\" Palveri said. \"He wouldn't send\na guy down without telling me about it.\"\n\n\"He did,\" Malone said. He thought back to the FBI files on Giacomo\nCastelnuovo, which took up a lot of space in Washington, even on\nmicrofilm. \"You want proof?\" he said. \"He's got a scar over his ribs\non the left side--got it from a bullet in '62. He wears a little black\nmustache because he thinks he looks like an old-time TV star, but he\ndoesn't, much. He's got three or four girls on the string, but the\nonly one he cares about is Carla Bragonzi. He--\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Palveri said. \"O.K., O.K. You know him. You're not fooling,\naround. But how come he sends you down without telling me?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I've been here two weeks,\" he said. \"You didn't know\nI was around, did you? That's the way Castelnuovo wanted it.\"\n\n\"He thinks I'd cheat him?\" Palveri said, his face changing color\nslightly. \"He thinks I'd dress up for him or drag down? He knows me\nbetter than that.\"\n\nMalone took a puff of his cigarette. \"Maybe he just wants to be sure,\"\nhe said. \"Funny things are happening all over.\" The cigarette tasted\nterrible and he put it out in an ashtray from the chair-covered table.\n\n\"You're telling me,\" Palveri said. \"Things are crazy. What I'm\nthinking is this: Maybe Castelnuovo wants to keep this place\noperating. Maybe he wants to keep me here working for him.\"\n\n\"And if he does?\" Malone said.\n\n\"If he does, he's going to have to pay for it,\" Palveri said firmly.\n\"The place needs dough to keep operating. I've got to have a loan, or\nelse I'm going under.\"\n\n\"The place is making money,\" Malone said.\n\nPalveri shook his head vigorously. He reached into a pocket and took\nout a gold cigar case. He flipped it open. \"Have one,\" he told Malone.\n\nAn FBI Agent, Malone told himself, had no business smoking cigars and\nlooking undignified. But as a messenger from Castelnuovo, he could do\nas he pleased. He almost reached for one before he realized that\nmaybe, sometime in the future, Palveri would find out who Kenneth J.\nMalone really was. And then he'd remember Malone smoking cigars, and\nthat would be bad for the dignity of the FBI. Reluctantly, he drew his\nhand back.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" he said. \"Never touch 'em.\"\n\n\"To each his own,\" Palveri muttered. He took out a cigar, lit it and\nreturned the case to his pocket. The immediate vicinity became crowded\nwith smoke. Malone breathed deeply.\n\n\"About the money--\" Malone said after a second.\n\nPalveri snorted. \"The place is making half of what I'm losing,\" he\nsaid. \"You got to see it this way, Malone: the contacts are gone.\"\n\n\"Contacts?\" Malone said.\n\nPalveri nodded. \"The mayor's resigned, remember?\" he said. \"You saw\nthat. Everybody's getting investigated. A couple of weeks ago the\nGolden Palace guy knocked himself off, and where does that leave me?\nHe's my only contact with half the State boys; hell, he ran the whole\nstring of clubs here, more or less. Castelnuovo knows all that.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But you can make new contacts.\"\n\n\"Where?\" Palveri said. He flung out his arms. \"When nobody knows\nwhat's going to happen tomorrow? I tell you, Malone, it's like a curse\non me.\"\n\nMalone decided to push the man a little farther. \"Castelnuovo,\" he\nsaid with what he hoped was a steely glint in his eyes, \"isn't going\nto like a curse ruining business.\" He took another deep breath of\ntobacco smoke.\n\n\"Primo Palveri don't like it either,\" Palveri said. \"You think\nwhatever you like but that's the way things are. It's like Prohibition\nexcept we're losing all the way down the line. Listen, and I'll tell\nyou something you didn't pick up around town.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Malone said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPalveri blew out some more smoke. \"You know about the shipments?\" he\nsaid. \"The stuff from out on the desert?\"\n\nMalone nodded. The FBI had a long file on the possibility of\nCastelnuovo, through Palveri or someone else in the vicinity, shipping\npeyotl buttons from Nevada and New Mexico all over the country. Until\nthis moment, it had only been a possibility.\n\n\"Mike Sand wanted to get in on some of that,\" Palveri said. \"Well,\nit's big money, a guy figures he's got to have competition. But it's\nbusiness nowadays, not a shooting war. That went out forty years ago.\"\n\n\"So?\" Malone said, acting impatient.\n\n\"I'm getting there,\" Palveri said. \"I'm getting there. Mike Sand and\nhis truckers, they tried to high jack a shipment coming through out on\nthe desert. Now, the Trucker's Union is old and experienced, maybe,\nbut not as old and experienced as the Mafia. It figures we can take\nthem, right?\"\n\n\"It figures,\" Malone agreed. \"But you didn't?\"\n\nPalveri looked doleful. \"It's like a curse,\" he said. \"Two boys\nwounded and one of them dead, right there on the sand. The shipment\ngone, and Mike Sand on his way to the East with it. A curse.\" He\nsucked some more at the cigar.\n\nMalone looked thoughtful and concerned. \"Things are certainly bad,\" he\nsaid. \"But how's money going to make things any better?\"\n\nPalveri almost dropped his cigar. Malone watched it lovingly. \"Help?\"\nthe club owner said. \"With money I could stay open, I could stay\nalive. Listen, I had investments, nice guaranteed stuff: real estate,\nsome California oil stuff ... you know the kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Now that the contacts are gone and everybody's dead or resigned or\nbeing investigated,\" Palveri said, \"what do you think's happened to\nall that? Down the drain, Malone.\"\n\nMalone said: \"But--\"\n\n\"And not only that,\" Palveri said, waving the cigar. \"The club was\ngoing good, and you know I thought about building a second one a\nlittle farther out. A straight investment, get me: an honest one.\"\n\nMalone nodded as if he knew all about it.\n\n\"So I got the foundation in, Malone,\" Palveri said, \"and it's just\nsitting there, not doing anything. A whole foundation going to pot\nbecause I can't do anything more with it. Just sitting there because\neverything's going to hell with itself.\"\n\n\"In a handbasket,\" Malone said automatically.\n\nPalveri gave him a violent nod. \"You said it, Malone,\" he added.\n\"Everything. My men, too.\" He sighed. \"And the contractor after me for\nhis dough. Good old Harry Seldon, everybody's friend. Sure. Owe him\nsome money and find out how friendly he is. Talks about nothing but\nfigures. Ten thousand. Twelve thousand.\"\n\n\"Tough,\" Malone said. \"But what do you mean about your men?\"\n\n\"Mistakes,\" Palveri said. \"Book-keepers throwing the computers off and\ncroupiers making mistakes paying off and collecting--and always\nmistakes against me, Malone. Always. It's like a curse. Even the hotel\nbills--three of them this week were made out too small and the\ncustomer paid up and went before I found out about it.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a curse,\" Malone said. \"Either that or there are spies\nin the organization.\"\n\n\"Spies?\" Palveri said. \"With the checking we do? With the way I've\nknown some of these guys from childhood? They were little kids with\nme, Malone. They stuck with me all the way. And with Castelnuovo,\ntoo,\" he added hurriedly.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But they could still be spies.\"\n\nPalveri nodded sadly. \"I thought of that,\" he said. \"I fired four of\nthem. Four of my childhood friends, Malone. It was like cutting off an\narm. And all it did was leave me with one arm less. The same mistakes\ngo on happening.\"\n\nMalone stood up and heaved a sigh. \"Well,\" he said, \"I'll see what I\ncan do.\"\n\n\"I'd appreciate it, Malone,\" Palveri said. \"And when Primo Palveri\nappreciates something, he _appreciates_ it. Get what I mean?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"I'll report back and let you know what happens.\"\n\nPalveri looked just as anxious, but a little hopeful. \"I need the\ndough,\" he said. \"I really need it.\"\n\n\"With dough,\" Malone said, \"you could fix up what's been happening?\"\n\nPalveri shrugged. \"Who knows?\" he said. \"But I could stay open long\nenough to find out.\"\n\nMalone went back to the gaming room feeling that he had learned\nsomething, but not being quite sure what. Obviously whatever\norganization was mixing everything up was paying just as much\nattention to gangsters as to congressmen and businessmen. The simple\njustice of this arrangement did not escape Malone, but he failed to\nsee where it led him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe considered the small chance that Palveri would actually call\nCastelnuovo and check up on Kenneth J. Malone, but he didn't think it\nwas probable. Palveri was too desperate to take the chance of making\nhis boss mad in case Malone's story were true. And, even if the check\nwere made, Malone felt reasonably confident. It's hard to kill a man\nwho has a good, accurate sense of precognition and who can teleport\nhimself out of any danger he might get into. Not impossible, but hard.\nBeing taken for a ride in the desert, for instance, might be an\ninteresting experience, but could hardly prove inconvenient to anybody\nexcept the driver of the car and the men holding the guns.\n\nThe gaming room wasn't any fuller, he noticed. He wended his way back\nto the bar for a bourbon-and-water and greeted the bartender morosely.\nThe drink came along and he sipped at it quietly, trying to put things\ntogether in his mind. The talk with Palveri, he felt sure, had\nprovided an essential clue--maybe _the_ essential clue--to what was\ngoing on. But he couldn't find it.\n\n\"Mess,\" he said quietly. \"Everything's in a mess. And so what?\"\n\nA voice behind him picked that second to say: \"Gezundheit.\" Malone\ndidn't turn. Instead he looked at the bar mirror, and one glance at\nwhat was reflected there was enough to freeze him as solid as the core\nof Pluto.\n\nLou was there. Lou Gehrig or whatever her name was, the girl behind\nthe reception desk of the New York offices of the Psychical Research\nSociety. That, in itself, didn't bother him. The company of a\nbeautiful girl while drinking was not something Malone actually hated.\nBut she knew he was an FBI Agent, and she might pick any second to\nblat it out in the face of an astonished bartender. This, Malone told\nhimself, would not be pleasant. He wondered just how to hush her up\nwithout attracting attention. Knock-out pills in her drink? A hand\nover her mouth? A sudden stream of unstoppable words?\n\nHe had reached no decision when she sat down on the stool beside him,\nturned a bright, cheerful smile in his direction and said: \"I've\nforgotten your name. Mine's Luba Ardanko.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said dully. Even the disclosure of what \"Lou\" stood for\ndid nothing to raise his spirits.\n\n\"I'm always forgetting things,\" Lou went on. \"I've forgotten just\nabout everything about you.\"\n\nMalone breathed a long, inaudible sigh of relief. If more people, he\nthought, had the brains not to greet FBI Agents by name, rank and\nserial number when meeting them in a strange place, there would be\nfewer casualties among the FBI.\n\nHe realized that Luba was still smiling at him expectantly. \"My name's\nMalone,\" he said. \"Kenneth Malone. I'm a cookie manufacturer,\nremember?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Luba said delightedly. \"Sure! I remember last time I met you you\ngave me that lovely box of cookies. Modeled on the Seven Dwarfs.\"\n\nOccasionally, Malone told himself, things moved a little faster than\nhe liked. \"On the Seven Dwarfs,\" he said. \"Oh, sure.\"\n\n\"And I thought the model of Sneezy was awfully cute,\" she said. \"But\ndon't let's talk about cookies. Let's talk about Martinis.\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, tried to think of something clever to say,\nand shut it again. Luba Ardanko was, perfectly obviously, altogether\ntoo fast for him. But then, he reflected, I've had a hard day. \"All\nright,\" he said at last. \"What _about_ Martinis?\"\n\nLuba's smile broadened. \"I'd like one,\" she said. \"And since you're a\nwealthy cookie manufacturer--\"\n\n\"Be my guest,\" Malone said. \"On the other hand, why not buy your own?\nSince they're free as long as you're in the gambling room.\"\n\nThe bartender had approached them silently. \"That's right,\" he said in\na voice that betrayed the fact that he had memorized the entire\nspeech, word for word. \"Drinks are free for those who play the gaming\ntables. A courtesy of the Great Universal.\"\n\nHe delivered a Martini and Luba drank it while Malone finished his\nbourbon-and-water. \"Well,\" she said, \"I suppose we've got to go to the\ngambling tables now. If only to be fair.\"\n\n\"A horrible fate,\" Malone agreed, \"but there you are: that's life.\"\n\n\"It certainly is,\" she said brightly, and moved off. Malone, shaking\nhis head, went after her and found her standing in front of a roulette\nwheel. \"I just love roulette,\" she said, turning. \"Don't you? It's so\nexciting and expensive.\"\n\nMalone licked dry lips, said: \"Sure,\" and started to move off.\n\n\"Oh, let's just play a little,\" Luba said.\n\nThere was nothing to do but agree. Malone put a small stack of silver\ndollars on Red, and the croupier looked up with a bored expression.\nThere were three other people in the game, including a magnificent old\nlady with blue hair who spent her money with a lavish hand. Two weeks\nbefore, she wouldn't even have been noticed. Now the croupier was\nbending over backward in an attempt not to show how grateful he was\nfor the patronage.\n\nThe wheel spun around and landed on Number Two, Black. Malone sighed\nand fished for more money. He felt his precognitive sense beginning to\ncome into play and happily decided to ride with it. This time the\nstack of silver dollars was larger.\n\nTwenty minutes later he left the table approximately nine hundred\ndollars richer. Luba was beaming. \"There, now,\" she said. \"Wasn't that\nfun?\"\n\n\"Hysterical,\" Malone said. He glanced back over his shoulder. The\nblue-haired old lady was winning and losing large sums with a speed\nand aplomb that was certainly going to make her a twenty-four-hour\nlegend by the end of the evening. She looked grim and secure, as if\nshe were undergoing a penance. Malone shrugged and looked away.\n\n\"Now,\" Luba said, \"you can take me dancing.\"\n\n\"I can?\" Malone said. \"I mean, do I? I mean--\"\n\n\"I mean the Solar Room,\" Luba said. \"I've always wanted to enter on\nthe arms of a handsome cookie manufacturer. It will make me the\nsensation of New York society.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Solar Room was magnificently expensive. Malone had been there\nonce, establishing his character as a man of lavish appetites, and had\nthen avoided the place in deference to his real bankroll. He\nremembered it as the kind of place where an order of scrambled eggs\nwas liable to come in, flaming, on a golden sabre. But Luba wanted the\nSolar Room, and Malone was not at all sure she wouldn't use blackmail\nif he turned her down. \"Fine,\" he said in a lugubrious tone.\n\nThe place shone, when they entered, as if they had come in from the\ndarkness of midnight. Along with the Universal Joint, it was the pride\nand glory of the Great Universal Hotel and no expense had been spared\nin the attempt to give it what Primo Palveri called Class. Couples and\nfoursomes were scattered around at the marble-topped tables, and\nred-uniformed waiters scurried around bearing drinks, food and even\noccasional plug-in telephones. There seemed to be more of the last\nthan Malone remembered as usual; people were worrying about\ninvestments and businesses, and even those who had decided to stick it\nout grimly at Las Vegas and, _enjoy_ themselves had to check up with\nthe home folks in order to know when to start pricing windows in high\nbuildings. Malone wondered how many people were actually getting their\ncalls through. Since the first breakdown two weeks before, Las Vegas\nand virtually every other United States city had suffered\ninterruptions in telephone service. Las Vegas had had three breakdowns\nin two weeks; other cities weren't doing much better, if at all.\n\nVaguely, Malone began looking around for handbaskets.\n\n\"Let's dance,\" Luba said happily. \"They're playing our song.\"\n\nOn a stand at the front of the room a small orchestra was working away\nbusily. There were two or three couples on the postage-stamp dance\nfloor, whirling away to the strains of something Malone dimly\nremembered as: \"My heart's in orbit out in space until I see you\nagain.\"\n\n\"Our song?\" he said.\n\nLuba nodded. \"You sang it to me the very first time we met,\" she said.\n\"At the cookie-manufacturer's ball. Remember?\"\n\nMalone sighed. If Luba wanted to dance, Luba was going to dance. And\nso was Malone. He rose and they went to the dance floor. Malone took\nher in his arms and for a few bars they danced silently. At the end of\nthat time they were much closer together than they had been, and\nMalone realized that he was somehow managing to enjoy himself.\nThoroughly.\n\nHe thought dimly of the stripper he'd seen when he walked in on\nPalveri. Like Luba, she had red hair. But somehow, she looked less\nattractive undressed than Luba did in a complete wardrobe. Malone\nwondered what the funny feeling creeping up his spine was. After a\nsecond he realized that it wasn't love. Luba's hand was tickling him.\nHe shifted slightly and the hand left, but the funny feeling remained.\n\nMaybe it _was_ love, he thought. He didn't know whether or not to hope\nso.\n\nLuba was pressed close to him. He wondered how to open the\nconversation, and decided that a sudden passionate declaration would\nbe more startling than welcome. At last he said: \"Thanks for not\ntipping my hand.\"\n\nLuba's whisper caressed his ear. \"Don't thank me,\" she said. \"I\nenjoyed it.\"\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Malone said. \"Not that I don't appreciate\nit, but I thought you were sore.\"\n\n\"Let's just say that your masterful, explosive approach was\nirresistible,\" Luba said.\n\nMalone wondered briefly whether or not they'd turned off the\nair-conditioning. If he moved slightly away from Luba, he thought, he\ncould breathe more easily. But breathing just wasn't worth it. \"I will\ncheerfully admit,\" he said, \"that I am a ball of fire in the\nfeathers, as they say. But I didn't realize it was that obvious--even\nto a woman of your tender sensitivity.\"\n\nSomehow, Luba had managed to get even closer to him. \"You touch me\ndeeply,\" she whispered into his ear.\n\nMalone swallowed hard and tried to take another breath. Just one more,\nhe thought; that would be all he needed. \"What are you doing in Las\nVegas?\" he asked in what he hoped was a casual tone. It didn't sound\nvery casual, though.\n\n\"I'm on vacation,\" Luba said in an off-handed manner. \"I won't ask\nwhat you're doing; I can guess pretty well. Besides, you obviously\nwant to keep it under cover.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I certainly wouldn't want what I'm doing to be\nbroadcast aloud to the great American public out there in\ntelevision-land.\" It was a long speech for a man without any breath.\nJust one more, Malone told himself, and he could die happy.\n\n\"I felt that,\" Luba said. \"You know, Mr. Malone--\"\n\n\"Call me Ken,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It is silly to be formal now, isn't it?\" Luba said. \"You know, Ken,\nI'm beginning to realize that you are really a very nice person--in\nspite of your rather surprising method of attack.\"\n\n\"What's surprising about it?\" Malone said. \"People do it all the\ntime.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe orchestra suddenly shifted from the previous slow number to a\nrapid fire tune Malone couldn't remember having heard before. \"That,\"\nhe announced, \"is too fast for me. I'm going to get some fresh air.\"\n\nLuba nodded, her red hair brushing Malone's cheek silkily. \"I'm\ncoming, too,\" she said.\n\nSurrounding the Great Universal, Malone remembered, was a small belt\nof parkland. He flagged a hallway car--remembering carefully to check\nwhether or not the driver was the sniggering Murray--and he and Luba\npiled in and started out for the park. In the car, he held her hand\nsilently, feeling a little like a bashful schoolboy and a little like\nSir Kenneth Malone. It was a strange mixture, but he decided that he\nliked it.\n\nThey got out, standing in the cool darkness of the park. Overhead a\nmoon and stars were shining. The little hallway car rolled away and\nthey were alone. Completely alone. Malone swallowed hard.\n\n\"Sleuth,\" Luba said softly in the darkness.\n\nMalone turned to face her.\n\n\"Sleuth,\" she said, \"don't you ever take a chance?\"\n\n\"Chance?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Luba said in a soft, sweet voice, \"kiss me, Ken.\"\n\nMalone had no answer to that--at least, no verbal answer. But then,\none didn't seem to be needed.\n\nWhen he finally came up for air, he said: \"Lou--\"\n\n\"Yes, Ken?\"\n\n\"Lou, how long are you going to be here? Or in New York? What I mean\nis--\"\n\n\"I'll be around,\" Lou said. \"I will be going back to New York of\ncourse; after all, Ken, I do have a living to make, such as it is, and\nSir Lewis is expecting me.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Malone said, \"but it still sounds funny. A girl like\nyou working for ... well, for the Psychical Research people. Ghosts\nand ectoplasm and all that.\"\n\nSuddenly Lou wasn't in his arms any more. \"Now, wait a minute,\" she\nsaid. \"You seemed to need their information, all right.\"\n\n\"But that was ... oh, well,\" Malone said. \"Never mind. Maybe I'm\nsilly. It really doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"I guess it doesn't, now,\" Lou said in a softer tone. \"Except that it\ndoes mean I'll be going back to New York pretty soon.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"But ... look, Lou, maybe we could work something\nout. I could tell Sir Lewis I needed you here for something, and then\nhe'd--\"\n\n\"My, my,\" she said. \"What it must be like to have all that influence.\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said.\n\nLou grinned, almost invisibly. \"Nothing,\" she said. \"Nothing. But, my\nfine feathered Fed, I don't want to be pulled around on somebody\nelse's string.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I mean it, Ken,\" Luba said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Suppose we table it for now, then,\" he said, \"and\nget around to it later. At dinner, say ... around nine?\"\n\n\"And just where,\" Luba said, \"will you be before nine? Making improper\nadvances to the local contingent of chorines?\"\n\n\"I will make improper advances,\" Malone vowed, \"only to you, Lou.\"\n\nLou's eyes sparkled. \"Goody,\" she said. \"I've always wanted to be a\nFallen Woman.\"\n\n\"But I have got some things to do before nine,\" Malone said. \"I've got\nto work, too.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Lou said in a suspiciously sweet voice, \"suppose I talk\nto Sir Lewis Carter, and tell him to keep you in New York? Then--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Malone said. \"Nine o'clock.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nXI\n\n    Somebody somewhere was wishing all the world \"a plague on\n    both your houses,\" and making it stick. Confusion is fun in a\n    comedy--but in the pilot of a plane or an executive of a\n    nation....\n\nBack in his room, Malone put on a fresh shirt, checked the .44 Magnum\nin his shoulder holster, changed jackets, adjusted his hat to the\nproper angle, and vanished.\n\nHe had, he'd realized, exactly one definite lead. And now he was going\nto follow up on it. The Government was apparently falling to pieces;\nso was business and so was the Mafia. Nobody Malone had heard of had\ngained anything. Except Mike Sand and his truckers. They'd beaten the\nMafia, at least.\n\nSand was worth a chat. Malone had a way to get in to see him, but he\nhad to work fast. Otherwise Sand would very possibly know what Malone\nwas trying to do. And that might easily be dangerous.\n\nHe had made his appearance in the darkness beneath one of the bridges\nat the southwest side of Central Park, in New York. It was hardly\nMalone's idea of perfect comfort, but it did mean safety; there was\nvery seldom anyone around after dark, and the shadows were thick\nenough so that his \"appearance\" would only mean, to the improbable\npasserby, that he had stepped out into the light.\n\nNow he strolled quietly over to Central Park West, and flagged a taxi\nheading downtown. He'd expected to run into one of the roving muggers\nwho still made the Park a trap for the unwary--he'd almost looked\nforward to it, in a way--but nobody appeared. It was unusual, but he\ndidn't have time to wonder about it.\n\nThe headquarters for the National Brotherhood of Truckers was east of\nGreenwich Village, on First Avenue, so Malone had plenty of time to\nthink things out while the cab wended its laborious southeast way.\nAfter a few minutes he realized that he would have even more time to\nthink than he'd planned on.\n\n\"Lots of traffic for this time of night,\" he volunteered.\n\nThe cabbie, a fiftyish man with a bald, wrinkled head and surprisingly\nbright blue eyes, nodded without turning his head. \"Maybe you think\nthis is bad,\" he said. \"You would not recognize the place an hour\nearlier, friend. During the real rush hour, I mean. Things are what\nthey call _meshuggah_, friend. It means crazy.\"\n\n\"How come?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The subway is on strike since last week,\" the cabbie said. \"The buses\nare also on strike. This means that everybody is using a car. They\ncan make it faster if they wish to walk, but they use a car. It does\nnot help matters, believe me.\"\n\n\"I can see that,\" Malone murmured.\n\n\"And the cops are not doing much good either,\" the cabbie went on,\n\"since they went on strike sometime last Tuesday.\"\n\nMalone nodded, and then did a double-take. \"Cops?\" he said. \"On\nstrike? But that's illegal. They could be arrested.\"\n\n\"You can be funny,\" the cabbie said. \"I am too sad to be funny.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Unless you are from Rhode Island,\" the cabbie said, \"or even farther\naway, you are deaf, dumb and blind. Everybody in New York knows what\nis going on by this time. I admit that it is not in the newspapers,\nbut the newspapers do not tell the truth since, as I remember it, the\nCity Council election of 1924, and then it is an accident, due to the\nmajor's best friend working in the printing plants.\"\n\n\"But cops can't go on strike,\" Malone said plaintively.\n\n\"This,\" the cabbie said in a judicious tone, \"is true. But they do not\ngive out any parking tickets any more, or any traffic citations\neither. They are working on bigger things, they say, and besides all\nthis there are not so many cops on the force now. They are spread very\nthin.\"\n\nMalone could see what was coming. \"Arrests of policemen,\" he said,\n\"and resignations.\"\n\n\"And investigations,\" the cabbie said. \"Mayor Amalfi is a good Joe\nand does not want anything in the papers until a real strike comes\nalong, but the word gets out anyhow, as it always does.\"\n\n\"Makes driving tough,\" Malone said.\n\n\"People can make better time on their hands and knees,\" the cabbie\nsaid, \"with the cops pulling a strike. They concentrate on big items\nnow, and you can even smoke in the subways if you can find a subway\nthat is running.\"\n\nMalone stopped to think how much of the city's income depended on\nparking tickets and small fines, and realized that a \"strike\" like the\none the police were pulling might be very effective indeed. And,\nunlike the participants in the Boston Police Strike of sixty-odd years\nbefore, these cops would have public sentiment on their side--since\nthey were keeping actual crime down.\n\n\"How long do they think it's going to last?\" Malone said.\n\n\"It can be over tomorrow,\" the cabbie said, \"but this is not generally\nbelieved in the most influential quarters. Mayor Amalfi and the new\nCommissioner try to straighten things out all day long, but the way\nthings go straightening them out does no good. Something big is in the\nwind, friend. I--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cab, on Second Avenue and Seventeenth Street, stopped for a\ntraffic light. Malone felt an itch in the back of his mind, as if his\nprescience were trying to warn him of something; he'd felt it for a\nlittle while, he realized, but only now could he pay attention to it.\n\nThe door on the driver's side opened suddenly, and so did the door\nnext to Malone. Two young men, obviously in their early twenties, were\nstanding in the openings, holding guns that were plainly intended for\nimmediate use.\n\nThe one next to the driver said, in a flat voice: \"Don't nobody get\nwise. That way nobody gets hurt. Give us--\"\n\nThat was as far as he got.\n\nWhen the rear door had opened, Malone had had a full second to prepare\nhimself, which was plenty of time. The message from his precognitive\npowers had come along just in time.\n\nThe second gunman thrust his gun into the cab. He seemed almost to be\nhanding it to Malone politely, and this effect was spoiled only by\nMalone's twist of the gunman's wrist, which must have felt as if he'd\nput his hand into a loop tied to the axle of a high-speed centrifuge.\nThe gunman let go of the gun and Malone, spurning it, let it drop.\n\nHe didn't need it. His other hand had gone into his coat and come out\nagain with the .44 Magnum.\n\nThe thug at the front of the car had barely realized what was\nhappening by the time it was all over. Automatic reflexes turned him\naway from the driver and toward the source of danger, his gun pointing\ntoward Malone. But the reflexes gave out as he found himself staring\ndown a rifled steel tube which, though hardly more than\nseven-sixteenths of an inch in diameter, must have looked as though a\nhigh-speed locomotive might come roaring out of it at any second.\n\nMalone hardly needed to bark: \"_Drop it!_\" The revolver hit the seat\nnext to the cabbie.\n\n\"Driver,\" Malone said in a conversational voice, \"can you handle a\ngun?\"\n\n\"Why, it is better than even that I still can,\" the cabbie said. \"I am\nin the business myself many years ago, before I see the error of my\nways and buy a taxi with the profits I make. It is a high-pay\nbusiness,\" he went on, \"but very insecure.\"\n\nThe cabbie scooped up the weapon by his side, flipped out the cylinder\nexpertly to check the cartridges, flipped it back in and centered the\nmuzzle on the gunman who'd dropped the revolver.\n\n\"It is more than thirty years since I use one of these,\" he said\ngently, \"but I do not forget how to pull the trigger, and at this\nrange I can hardly miss.\"\n\nMalone noticed vaguely that he was still holding hands with the second\ngunman, and that this one was trying to struggle free. Malone shrugged\nand eased off a bit, at the same time shifting his own aim. The .44\nMagnum now pointed at gunman number two, and the cabbie was aiming at\ngunman number one. The tableau was silent for some seconds.\n\n\"Now,\" Malone said at last, \"we wait. Driver, if you would sort of\nlean against your horn button, we might be able to speed things up a\nlittle. The light has turned green.\"\n\n\"The local constables,\" the cabbie said, \"do not bother with stalled\ncars in traffic these days.\"\n\n\"But,\" Malone pointed out, \"I have a hunch no cop could resist a taxi\nwhich is not only stalled and blocking traffic but is also blatting\nits horn continuously. Strike or no strike,\" he finished\nsententiously, \"there are things beyond the power of man to ignore.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" the cabbie said, \"you convince me. It is a good move.\" He\nsagged slightly against the horn button, keeping the gun centered at\nall times on the man before him.\n\nThe horn began to wail horribly.\n\nThe first gunman swallowed nervously. \"Hey, now, listen,\" he said,\nshouting slightly above the horn. \"This wasn't anything. Just a gag,\nsee? A little gag. We was playing a joke. On a friend.\"\n\nThe driver addressed Malone. \"Do you ever see either of these boys\nbefore?\"\n\n\"Never,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Nor do I,\" the cabbie said. He eyed the gunman. \"We are not your\nfriend,\" he said. \"Either of us.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" the gunman said. \"Not you. This friend, he ... uh ... owns a\ntaxi, and we thought this was it. It was kind of a joke, see? A\nfriendly joke, that's all. Believe me, the gun's not even loaded. Both\nof them aren't. Phony bullets, honest. Believe me?\"\n\n\"Why, naturally I believe you,\" the cabbie said politely. \"I never\ndoubt the word of a stranger, especially such an honest-appearing\nstranger as you seem to be. And since the gun is loaded with false\nbullets, as you say, all you have to do is reach over and take it away\nfrom me.\"\n\nThere was a short silence.\n\n\"A joke,\" the gunman said feebly. \"Honest, just a joke.\"\n\n\"We believe you,\" Malone assured him grandly. \"As a matter of fact, we\nappreciate the joke so much that we want you to tell it to a panel of\ntwelve citizens, a judge and a couple of lawyers, so they can\nappreciate it, too. They get little fun out of life and your joke may\ngive them a few moments of happiness. Why hide your light under an\nalibi?\"\n\nThe horn continued its dismal wail for a few seconds more before two\npatrolmen and a sergeant came up on horses. It took somewhat more time\nthan that for Malone to convince the sergeant that he didn't have time\nto go down to the station to prefer charges. He showed his\nidentification and the police were suitably impressed.\n\n\"Lock 'em up for violating the Sullivan Law,\" he said. \"I'm sure they\ndon't have licenses for these lovely little guns of theirs.\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" the sergeant agreed. \"There's been an awful lot of\nthis kind of thing going on lately. But here's an idea: the cabbie\nhere can come on with us.\"\n\nThe top of the cabbie's head turned pale. \"That,\" he said, \"is the\ntrouble with being a law-abiding citizen such as I have been for\nupwards of thirty years. Because I do not want to lose twenty dollars\nto these young strangers, I lose twenty dollars' worth of time in a\nprecinct station, the air of which is very bad for my asthma.\"\n\nMalone, taking the hint, dug a twenty out of his pockets, and then\nadded another to it, remembering how much he had spent in Las Vegas,\nwhere his money funneled slowly into the pockets of Primo Palveri. The\ncabbie took the money with haste and politeness and stowed it away.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I am now prepared to spend the entire night\nsigning affidavits, if enough affidavits can be dug up.\" He looked\npleased.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" the sergeant said wearily, \"people just don't realize\nwhat's going on in this town. We never did have half enough cops, and\nnow, with so many men resigning and getting arrested and suspended, we\nhaven't got a quarter enough. People think this strike business is\nfunny, but if we spent any time fiddling around with traffic and\nparking tickets, we'd never have time to stop even crimes like this,\nlet alone the big jobs. As it is, though, there haven't been a lot of\nbig ones. Every hood in the city's out to make a couple of bucks--but\nthat's it so far, thank God.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"How about the FBI?\" he said. \"Want them to come in and\nhelp?\"\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" the sergeant said, \"the City of New York can take very\ngood care of itself, without outside interference.\"\n\nSome day, Malone told himself, good old New York City was going to\nsecede from the Union and form a new country entirely. Then it would\nhave a war with New Jersey and probably be wiped right off the map.\n\nViewing the traffic around him as he hunted for another cab, he wasn't\nat all sure that that was a bad idea. He began to wish vaguely that he\nhad borrowed one of the policemen's horses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone wasn't in the least worried about arriving at Mike Sand's\noffice late. In the first place, Sand was notorious for sleeping late\nand working late to make up for it. His work schedule was somewhere\naround forty-five degrees out of phase with the rest of the world,\nwhich made it just about average for the National Brotherhood of\nTruckers. It had never agitated for a nine-to-five work day. A man\ndriving a truck, after all, worked all sorts of odd hours--and the\nunion officials did the same, maybe just to prove that they were all\ngood truckers at heart.\n\nThe sign over the door read:\n\n                 National Headquarters\n                  NATIONAL BROTHERHOOD\n                      OF TRUCKERS\n                   Welcome, Brother\n\nMalone pushed at the door and it swung open, revealing a rather\ndingy-looking foyer. More Good Old Truckers At Heart, he told himself.\nMike Sand owned a quasi-palatial mansion in Puerto Rico for winter\nuse, and a two-floor, completely air-conditioned apartment on Fifth\nAvenue for summer use. But the Headquarters Building looked dingy\nenough to make truckers conscience-stricken about paying back dues.\n\nBehind the reception desk there was a man whose face was the\napproximate shape and color of a slightly used waffle. He looked up\nfrom his crossword puzzle as Malone came in, apparently trying to\ndecide whether or not this new visitor should be greeted with:\n\"Welcome, Brother!\"\n\nTaking pity on his indecision, Malone strode to the desk and said:\n\"Tell Mike Sand he has a visitor.\"\n\nThe waffle-faced man blinked. \"Mr. Sand is busy right now,\" he said.\n\"Who wants to talk to him?\"\n\nMalone tried to look steely-eyed and tough. \"You pick up the\nintercom,\" he said, \"and you tell Sand there's a man out here who's in\nthe cloak-and-suit business.\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"Tell him this man is worried about a recent shipment of buttons,\"\nMalone went on.\n\n\"Mister,\" the waffle-faced man said, \"you're nuts.\"\n\n\"So I'm nuts,\" Malone said. \"Make the call.\"\n\nIt was put through. After a few minutes of earnest conversation the\nman turned to look at Malone again, dizzied wonder in his eyes. \"Mr.\nSand says go right up,\" he told the FBI Agent in a shocked voice.\n\"Elevator to the third floor.\"\n\nMalone went over to the elevator, stepped in and pressed the\nthird-floor button. As the doors closed, the familiar itch of\nprecognition began to assail him again. This time he had nothing else\nto distract him. He paid very close attention to it as he was carried\nslowly and creakily upward.\n\nHe looked up. There was an escape-hatch in the top of the car.\nStanding on tiptoe, he managed to lift it aside, grasp the edges of\nthe resulting hole and pull himself up through the hole to the top of\nthe car. He looked back down, memorizing the elevator, and then pulled\nthe hatch shut again. There was a small peephole in it, and Malone put\nhis eye to it and waited.\n\nAbout twenty seconds later, the car stopped and the doors opened. A\nlittle more time passed, and then a gun, closely followed by a man,\nedged around the door frame.\n\n\"What the hell,\" the man said. \"The car's empty!\"\n\nAnother voice said: \"Let's cover the stairway.\"\n\nTwo pairs of footsteps receded rapidly down the hall. Malone, gun in\nhand, teleported himself back to the previously memorized elevator,\ntiptoed to the door and looked out. The two men were standing at the\nfar end of the hall, posted at either side of the stairwell and\nobviously waiting for him to come on up.\n\nInstead, he tiptoed out of the elevator hefting his gun, and came up\nsilently behind the pair. When he was within ten feet he stopped and\nsaid, very politely: \"Drop the guns, boys.\"\n\nThe guns thudded to the floor and the two men turned round.\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said, smiling into their astonished faces. \"Now,\nlet's go on and see Mr. Sand.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe picked up the guns with his free hand and put them into his coat\npockets. Together, the three men went down toward the lighted office\nat the far end of the hall.\n\n\"Open it,\" Malone said as they came to the door. He followed them into\nthe office. Behind a battered, worm-eaten desk in a dingy room sat a\nvery surprised-looking Mike Sand.\n\nHe was only about five feet six, but he looked as if weighed over two\nhundred pounds. He had huge shoulders and a thick neck, and his face\nwas sleepy-looking. He seemed to have lost a lot of fights in his long\ncareer; Sand, Malone reflected, was nearing fifty now, and he was\nbeginning to look his age. His short hair, once black, was turning to\niron-gray.\n\nHe didn't say anything. Malone smiled at him pleasantly. \"These boys\nwere carrying deadly weapons,\" he told Sand in a polite voice. \"That's\nhardly the way to treat a brother.\" His precognitive warning system\nwasn't ringing any alarm bells, but he kept his gun trained on the\npair of thugs as he walked over to Mike Sand's desk and took the two\nextra revolvers from his pocket. \"You'd better keep these, Sand,\" he\nsaid. \"Your boys don't know how to handle them.\"\n\nSand grinned sourly, pulled open a desk drawer and swept the guns into\nit with one motion of his ham-like hand. He didn't look at Malone.\n\"You guys better go downstairs and keep Jerry company,\" he said. \"You\ncan do crossword puzzles together.\"\n\n\"Now, Mike, we--\" one of them began.\n\nMike Sand snorted. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Scram.\"\n\n\"But he was supposed to be in the elevator, and we--\"\n\n\"Scram,\" Sand said. It sounded like a curse. The two men got out.\n\"Like apes in the trees,\" Sand said heavily. \"Ask for bright boys and\nwhat do you get? Everything,\" he went on dismally, \"is going to hell.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat line, Malone reflected, was beginning to have all the persistence\nof a bass-bourdon. It droned its melancholy way through anything and\neverything else. He signed deeply, thought about a cigar and lit a\ncigarette instead. It tasted awful. \"About those buttons--\" he said.\n\n\"I got nothing to do with buttons,\" Sand said.\n\n\"You do with these,\" Malone said. \"A shipment of buttons from the\nNevada desert. You grabbed them from Palveri.\"\n\n\"I got nothing to do with it,\" Sand said.\n\nMalone looked around and found a chair and an ashtray. He grabbed one\nand sat down in the other. \"I'm not from Castelnuovo,\" he said. \"Or\nPalveri, or any of the Mafia boys. If I were, you'd know it fast\nenough.\"\n\nSand regarded him from under eyelids made almost entirely of\nscar-tissue. \"I guess so,\" he said sourly at last. \"But what do you\nwant to know about the stuff? And who are you, anyhow?\"\n\n\"The name's Malone,\" Malone said. \"You might say trouble is my\nbusiness. Or something like that. I see an opportunity to create a\nlittle trouble--but not for you. That is, if you want to hear some\nmore about those buttons. Of course, if you had nothing to do with\nit--\"\n\n\"All right,\" Sand said. \"All right. But it was strictly a legitimate\nproposition, understand?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Strictly legitimate.\"\n\n\"Well, it was,\" Sand said defensively. \"We got to stop scab trucking,\ndon't we? And that Palveri was using nonunion boys on the trucks. We\nhad to stop them; it was a service to the Brotherhood, understand?\"\n\n\"And the peyotl buttons?\" Malone asked.\n\nSand shrugged. \"So we had to confiscate the cargo, didn't we?\" he\nsaid. \"To teach them a lesson. Nonunion drivers, that's what we're\nagainst.\"\n\n\"And you're for peyotl,\" Malone said, \"so you can make it into peyote\nand get enough money to refurbish Brotherhood Headquarters.\"\n\n\"Now, look,\" Sand said. \"You think you're tough and you can get away\nwith a lot of wisecracks. That's a wrong idea, brother.\" He didn't\nmove, but he suddenly seemed set to spring. Malone wondered if, just\nmaybe, his precognition had blown a fuse.\n\n\"O.K., let's forget it,\" he said. \"But I've got some inside lines,\nSand. You didn't get the real shipment.\"\n\n\"Didn't get it?\" Sand said with raised eyebrows. \"I got it. It's\nright where I can put my finger on it now.\"\n\n\"That was the fake,\" Malone said easily. \"They knew you were after a\nshipment, Sand, so they suckered you in. They fed your spies with\nfalse information and sent you out after the fake shipment.\"\n\n\"Fake shipment?\" Sand said. \"It's the real stuff, brother. The real\nstuff.\"\n\n\"But not enough of it,\" Malone said. \"Their big shipments are almost\nthree times what you got. They made one while you were suckered off\nwith the fake--and they're making another one next week. Interested?\"\n\nSand snorted. \"The hell,\" he said. \"Didn't you hear me say I got the\nfirst shipment right where I can put my finger on it?\"\n\n\"So?\" Malone said.\n\n\"So I can't get rid of it,\" Sand said. \"What do I want with a new\nload? Every day I hold the stuff is dangerous. You never know when\nsomebody's going to look for it and maybe find it.\"\n\n\"Can't get rid of it?\" Malone said. This was a new turn of events.\n\"What's happening?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" Sand said tersely. \"Look, you want to sell me some\ninformation--but you don't know the setup. Maybe when I tell you,\nyou'll stop bothering me.\" He put his head in his hands, and his\nvoice, when he spoke again, was muffled. \"The contacts are gone,\" he\nsaid. \"With the arrests and the resignations and everything else,\nnobody wants to take any chances; the few guys that aren't locked up\nare scared they will be. I can't make any kind of a deal for anything.\nThere just isn't any action.\"\n\n\"Things are tough, huh?\" Malone said hopelessly. Apparently even Mike\nSand wasn't going to pan out for him.\n\n\"Things are terrible,\" Sand said. \"The locals are having\nrevolutions--guys there are kicking out the men from National\nHeadquarters. Nobody knows where he stands any more--a lot of my\norganizers have been goofing up and getting arrested for one thing and\nanother. Like apes in the trees, that's what.\"\n\nMalone nodded very slowly and took another puff of the cigarette.\n\"Nothing's going right,\" he said.\n\n\"Listen,\" Sand said. \"You want to hear trouble? My account books are\nin duplicate--you know? Just to keep things nice and peaceful and\nquiet.\"\n\n\"One for the investigators and one for the money,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Sand said, preoccupied with trouble. \"You know the setup. But\nboth sets are missing. Both sets.\" He raised his head, the picture of\nwitless agony. \"I've got an idea where they are, too. I'm just waiting\nfor the axe to fall.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Malone said. \"Where are they?\"\n\n\"The U. S. Attorney's Office,\" Sand said dismally. He stared down at\nhis battered desk and sighed.\n\nMalone stubbed out his cigarette. \"So you're not in the market for any\nmore buttons?\" he said.\n\n\"All I'm in the market for,\" Sand said without raising his eyes, \"is\na nice, painless way to commit suicide.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalone walked several blocks without noticing where he was going. He\ntried to think things over, and everything seemed to fall into a\npattern that remained, agonizingly, just an inch or so out of his\nmental reach. The mental bursts, the trouble the United States was\nhaving, Palveri, Queen Elizabeth, Burris, Mike Sand, Dr. O'Connor, Sir\nLewis Carter and even Luba Ardanko juggled and flowed in his mind like\npieces out of a kaleidoscope. But they refused to form any pattern he\ncould recognize.\n\nHe uttered a short curse and managed to collide with a bulky woman\nwith frazzled black hair. \"Pardon me,\" he said politely.\n\n\"The hell with it,\" the woman said, looking straight past him, and\nwent jerkily on her way. Malone blinked and looked around him. There\nwere a lot of people still on the streets, but they didn't look like\nnormal New York City people. They were all curiously tense and wary,\nas if they were suspicious not only of him and each other, but even\nthemselves. He caught sight of several illegal-looking bulges beneath\nmen's armpits, and many heavily sagging pockets. One or two women\nappeared to be unduly solicitous of their large and heavy handbags.\nBut it wasn't his job to enforce the Sullivan Law, he told himself.\nEspecially while he was on vacation.\n\nA single foot patrolman stood a few feet ahead, guarding a liquor\nstore with drawn revolver, his eyes scanning the passers-by warily\nwhile he waited for help. Behind him, the smashed plate glass and\nbroken bottles and the sprawled figure just inside the door told a\nfairly complete story.\n\nDown the block, Malone saw several stores that carried _Closed_ or\n_Gone Out Of Business_ signs. The whole depressing picture gave him\nthe feeling that all the tragedies of the 1930-1935 period had somehow\nbeen condensed into the past two weeks.\n\nAhead there was a chain drugstore, and Malone headed for it. Two\nuniformed men wearing Special Police badges were standing near the\ndoor eyeing everyone with suspicion, but Malone managed to get past\nthem and went on to a telephone booth. He tried dialling the\nWashington number of the FBI, but got only a continuous _beep-beep_,\nindicating a service delay. Finally he managed to get a special\noperator, who told him sorrowfully that calls to Washington were\njamming all available trunk lines.\n\nMalone glanced around to make sure nobody was watching. Then he\nteleported himself to his apartment in Washington and, on arriving,\nheaded for the phone there. Using that one, he dialed again, got\nPelham's sad face on the screen, and asked for Thomas Boyd.\n\nBoyd didn't look any different, Malone thought, though maybe he was a\nlittle more tired. Henry VIII had obviously had a hard day trying to\nget his wives to stop nagging him. \"Ken,\" he said. \"I thought you were\non vacation. What are you doing calling up the FBI, or do you just\nwant to feel superior to us poor working slobs?\"\n\n\"I need some information,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd uttered a short, mirthless laugh. \"How to beat the tables, you\nmean?\" he said. \"How are things in good old Las Vegas?\"\n\nMalone, realizing that with direct-dial phones Boyd had no idea where\nhe was actually calling from, kept wisely quiet. \"How about Burris?\"\nhe said after a second. \"Has he come up with any new theories yet?\"\n\n\"New theories?\" Boyd said. \"What about?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" Malone said. \"From all I see in the papers things\nhaven't been quieting down any. Is it still Brubitsch, Borbitsch and\nGarbitsch putting psychodrugs in water-coolers, or has something new\nbeen added?\"\n\n\"I don't know what the chief thinks,\" Boyd said. \"Things'll straighten\nout in a while. We're working on it--twenty-four hours a day, or damn\nnear, but we're working. While you take a nice, long vacation that--\"\n\n\"I want you to get me something,\" Malone said. \"Just go and get it and\nsend it to me at Las Vegas.\"\n\n\"Money?\" Boyd said with raised eyebrows.\n\n\"Dossiers,\" Malone said. \"On Mike Sand and Primo Palveri.\"\n\n\"Palveri I can understand,\" Boyd said. \"You want to threaten him with\nexposure unless he lets you beat the roulette tables. But why Sand?\nKen, are you working on something psionic?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said sweetly. \"I'm on vacation.\"\n\n\"The chief won't like--\"\n\n\"Can you send me the dossiers?\" Malone interrupted.\n\nBoyd shook his head very slowly. \"Ken, I can't do it without the chief\nfinding out about it. If you are working on something ... hell, I'd\nlike to help you. But I don't see how I can. You don't know what\nthings are like here.\"\n\n\"What are they like?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The full force is here,\" Boyd said. \"As far as I know, you're the\nonly vacation leave not canceled yet. And not only that, but we've got\nagents in from the Suret\u00e9 and New Scotland Yard, agents from Belgium\nand Germany and Holland and Japan ... Ken, we've even got three MVD\nmen here working with us.\"\n\n\"It's happening all over?\" Malone said.\n\n\"All over the world,\" Boyd said. \"Ken, I'm beginning to think we've\ngot a case of Martian Invaders on our hands. Or something like it.\" He\npaused. \"But we're licking them, Ken,\" he went on. \"Slowly but surely,\nwe're licking them.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Crime is down,\" Boyd said, \"away down. Major crime, I mean--petty\ntheft, assault, breaking and entering and that sort of thing has gone\naway up, but that's to be expected. Everything's going to--\"\n\n\"Skip the handbasket,\" Malone said. \"But you're working things out?\"\n\n\"Sooner or later,\" Boyd said. \"Every piece of equipment and every man\nin the FBI is working overtime; we can't be stopped forever.\"\n\n\"I'll wave flags,\" Malone said bitterly. \"And I wish I could join\nyou.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" Boyd said, \"you don't know when you're well off.\"\n\nMalone switched off. He looked at his watch; it was ten-thirty.\n\n\nXII\n\nThat made it eight-thirty in Las Vegas. Malone opened his eyes again\nin his hotel room there. He had half an hour to spare until his dinner\ndate with Luba. That gave him plenty of time to shower, shave and\ndress, and he felt pleased to have managed the timing so neatly.\n\nTwo minutes later, he was soaking in the luxury of a hot tub allowing\nthe warmth to relax his body while his mind turned over the facts he\nhad collected. There were a lot of them, but they didn't seem to mean\nanything special.\n\nThe world, he told himself, was going to hell in a handbasket. That\nwas all very well and good, but just what was the handbasket made of?\nBurris' theory, the more he thought about it, was a pure case of\nmental soapsuds, with perhaps a dash of old cotton-candy to make\nconfusion even worse confounded.\n\nAnd there wasn't any other theory, was there?\n\nWell, Malone reflected, there was one, or at least a part of one. Her\nMajesty had said that everything was somehow tied up with the mental\nbursts--and that sounded a lot more probable. Assuming that the bursts\nand the rest of the mixups were _not_ connected made, as a matter of\nfact, very little sense; it was multiplying hypotheses without reason.\nWhen two unusual things happen, they have at least one definite\nconnection: they're both unusual. The sensible thing to do, Malone\nthought, was to look for more connections.\n\nWhich meant asking who was causing the bursts, and why. Her Majesty\nhad said that she didn't know, and couldn't do it herself. Obviously,\nthough, some telepath or a team of telepaths was doing the job. And\nthe only trouble with that, Malone reflected sadly, was that all\ntelepaths were in the Yucca Flats laboratory.\n\nIt was at this point that he sat upright in the tub, splashing water\nover the floor and gripping the soap with a strange excitement. Who'd\never said that _all_ the telepaths were in Yucca Flats? All the ones\nso far discovered were--but that, obviously, was an entirely different\nmatter.\n\nHer majesty didn't know about any others, true. But Malone thought of\nhis own mind-shield. If he could make himself telepathically\n\"invisible,\" why couldn't someone else? Dr. Marshall's theories seemed\nto point the other way--but they only went for telepaths like Her\nMajesty, who were psychotic. A sane telepath, Malone thought, might\nconceivably develop such a mind-shield.\n\nAll known telepaths were nuts, he told himself. Now, he began to see\nwhy. He'd started out, two years before, _hunting_ for nuts, and for\nidiots. But they wouldn't even know anything about sane telepaths--the\nsane ones probably wouldn't even want to communicate with them.\n\nA sane telepath was pretty much of an unknown quantity. But that,\nMalone told himself with elation, was exactly what he was looking for.\nCould a sane telepath do what an insane one couldn't--and project\nthoughts, or at least mental bursts?\n\nHe got out of the cooling tub and grabbed for a terry-cloth robe. Not\neven bothering about the time, he closed his eyes. When he opened them\nagain he was in the Yucca Flats apartment of Dr. Thomas O'Connor.\n\nO'Connor wasn't sleeping, exactly. He sat in a chair in his\nbare-looking living room, a book open on his lap, his head nodding\nslightly. Malone's entrance made no sounds, and O'Connor didn't move\nor look around.\n\n\"Doctor,\" Malone said, \"is it possible that--\"\n\nO'Connor came up off the chair a good foot and a half. He went: \"Eee,\"\nand came down again, still gripping the book. His head turned.\n\n\"It's me,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Indeed,\" O'Connor said. \"Indeed indeed. My goodness.\" He opened his\nmouth some more but no words came out of it. \"Eee,\" he said again, at\nlast, in a conversational tone.\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry I startled you,\" he said, \"but\nthis is important and it couldn't wait.\" O'Connor stared blankly at\nhim. \"Dr. O'Connor,\" Malone said, \"it's me. Kenneth J. Malone. I want\nto talk to you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last O'Connor's expression returned almost to normal. \"Mr. Malone,\"\nhe said, \"you are undressed.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"This is important, doctor,\" he said. \"Let's not waste\ntime with all that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Malone--\" O'Connor began frostily.\n\n\"I need some information,\" Malone said, \"and maybe you've got it. What\ndo you know about telepathic projection?\"\n\n\"About what?\" O'Connor said. \"Do you mean nontelepaths receiving some\nsort of ... communication from telepaths?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"Mind-to-mind communication, of course; I'm not\ninterested in the United States mail or the telephone companies. How\nabout it, doctor? Is it possible?\"\n\nO'Connor gnawed at his lower lip for a second. \"There have been cases\nreported,\" he said at last. \"Very few have been written up with any\naccuracy, and those seem to be confined to close relatives or loved\nones of the person projecting the message.\"\n\n\"Is that necessary?\" Malone said. \"Isn't it possible that--\"\n\n\"Further,\" O'Connor said, getting back into his lecture-room stride,\n\"I think you'll find that the ... ah ... message so received is one\nindicating that the projector of such a message is in dire peril. He\nhas, for instance, been badly injured, or is rapidly approaching\ndeath, or else he has narrowly escaped death.\"\n\n\"What does that have to do with it?\" Malone said. \"I mean, why should\nall those requirements be necessary?\"\n\nO'Connor frowned slightly. \"Because,\" he said, \"the amount of psionic\nenergy necessary for such a feat is tremendous. Usually, it is the\nfinal burst of energy, the outpouring of all the remaining psionic\nforce immediately before death. And if death does not occur, the\nperson is at the least greatly weakened; his mind, if it ever does\nrecover, needs time and rest to do so.\"\n\n\"And he reaches a relative or a loved one,\" Malone said, \"because the\nlinkage is easier; there's some thought of him in that other mind for\nhim to 'tune in' on.\"\n\n\"We assume so,\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" Malone said. \"I'll assume so, too. But if the\nenergy is so great, then a person couldn't do this sort of thing very\noften.\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" O'Connor said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"It's like ... like giving blood to a blood bank,\" he\nsaid. \"Giving ... oh, three quarts of blood. It might not kill you.\nBut if it didn't, you'd be weak for a long time.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" O'Connor said. \"A good analogy, Mr. Malone.\" Malone looked\nat him and felt relieved that he'd managed to get the conversation\nonto pure lecture-room science so quickly. O'Connor, easily at home in\nthat world, had been able to absorb the shock of Malone's sudden\nappearance while providing the facts in his own inimitable, frozen\nmanner.\n\n\"So one telepath couldn't go on doing it all the time,\" he said.\n\"But--how about several people?\"\n\n\"Several people?\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"I mean ... well, let's look at that blood bank again,\" Malone said.\n\"You need three quarts of blood. But one person doesn't have to give\nit. Suppose twelve people gave half a pint each.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" O'Connor said. \"I see. Or twenty-four people, giving a\nquarter-pint each. Or--\"\n\n\"That's the idea,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"I guess there'd be a point\nof diminishing returns, but that's the point. Would something like\nthat be possible?\"\n\nO'Connor thought for what seemed like a long time. \"It might,\" he said\nat last. \"At least theoretically. But it would take a great deal of\nmental co-ordination among the participants. They would all have to be\ntelepaths, of course.\"\n\n\"In order to mesh their thoughts right on the button, and direct them\nproperly and at the correct time,\" Malone said. \"Right?\"\n\n\"Ah ... correct,\" O'Connor said. \"Given that, Mr. Malone, I imagine\nthat it might possibly be done.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Malone said.\n\n\"However,\" O'Connor said, apparently glad to throw even a little cold\nwater on the notion, \"it could not be done for very long periods of\ntime, you understand. It would happen in rather short bursts.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said, enjoying the crestfallen look on\nO'Connor's face. \"That's exactly what I was looking for.\"\n\n\"I'm ... ah ... glad to have been of service,\" O'Connor said.\n\"However, Mr. Malone, I should like to request--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry,\" Malone said. \"I won't slam the door.\" He vanished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was eight-fifty. Hurriedly, he rinsed himself off, shaved and put\non his evening clothes. But he was still late--it was two minutes\nafter nine when he showed up at the door that led off the lobby to the\nUniversal Joint. Luba was, surprisingly, waiting for him there.\n\n\"Ready for a vast feast?\" she asked pleasantly.\n\n\"In about a minute and a half,\" Malone said. \"Do you mind waiting that\nlong?\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" Luba said, \"in five minutes I will be gnawing holes in the\ngold paneling around here. And I do want to catch the first floor\nshow, too. I understand they've got a girl who has--\"\n\n\"That,\" Malone said sternly, \"should interest me more than it does\nyou.\"\n\n\"I'm always interested in what the competition is doing,\" Luba said.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" Malone began, and stopped. After a second he started\nagain: \"Anyhow, this is important.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"All right,\" she said instantly. \"What is it?\"\n\nHe led her away from the door to an alcove in the lobby where they\ncould talk without being overheard. \"Can you get hold of Sir Lewis at\nthis time of night?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sir Lewis?\" she said. \"If ... if it's urgent, I suppose I could.\"\n\n\"It's urgent,\" Malone said. \"I need all the data on telepathic\nprojection I can get. The scientists have given me some of it--maybe\nPsychical Research has some more. I imagine it's all mixed up with\nghosts and ectoplasm, but--\"\n\n\"Telepathic projection,\" Luba said. \"Is that where a person projects a\nthought into somebody else's mind?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" Malone said. \"Can Sir Lewis get me all the data on that\ntonight?\"\n\n\"Tonight?\" Luba said. \"It's pretty late and what with sending them\nfrom New York to Nevada--\"\n\n\"Don't bother about that,\" Malone said. \"Just send 'em to the FBI\nOffices in New York. I'll have the boys there make copies and send the\ncopies on.\" Instead, he thought, he would teleport to New York\nhimself. But Luba definitely didn't have to know that.\n\n\"He'd have to send the originals,\" Luba said.\n\n\"I'll guarantee their safety,\" Malone said. \"But I need the data right\nnow.\"\n\nLuba hesitated.\n\n\"Tell him to bill the FBI,\" Malone said. \"Call him collect and he can\nbill the phone call, too.\"\n\n\"All right, Ken,\" Luba said at last. \"I'll try.\"\n\nShe went off to make the call, and came back in a few minutes.\n\n\"O.K.?\" Malone said.\n\nShe smiled at him, very gently. \"O.K.,\" she said. \"Now let's go in to\ndinner, before I get any hungrier and the Great Universal loses some\nof its paneling.\"\n\nDinner, Malone told himself, was going to be wonderful. He was alone\nwith Luba, and he was in a fancy, fine, expensive place. He was happy,\nand Luba was happy, and everything was going to be perfectly frabjous.\n\nIt was. He had no desire whatever, when dinner and the floor show were\nover, to leave Luba. Unfortunately, he did have work to do--work that\nwas more important than anything else he could imagine. He made a\ntentative date for the next day, went to his room, and from there\nteleported himself to FBI Headquarters, New York.\n\nThe agent-in-charge looked up at him. \"Hey,\" he said. \"I thought you\nwere on vacation, Malone.\"\n\n\"How come everybody knows about me being on vacation?\" Malone said\nsourly.\n\nThe agent-in-charge shrugged. \"The only leave not canceled?\" he said.\n\"Hell, it was all over the place in five minutes.\"\n\n\"O.K., O.K.,\" Malone said. \"Don't remind me. Is there a package for\nme?\"\n\nThe agent-in-charge produced a large box. \"A messenger brought it,\" he\nsaid. \"From the Psychical Research Society,\" he said. \"What is it,\nghosts?\"\n\n\"Dehydrated,\" Malone said. \"Just add ectoplasm and out they come,\nshouting _Boo!_ at everybody.\"\n\n\"Sounds wonderful,\" the agent-in-charge said. \"Can I come to the\nparty?\"\n\n\"First,\" Malone said judiciously, \"you'd have to be dead. Of course I\ncan arrange that--\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" the agent-in-charge said, leaving in a hurry. Malone went on\ndown to his office and opened the box. It contained books, pamphlets\nand reports from Sir Lewis, all dealing with some area of telepathic\nprojection. He spent a few minutes looking them over and trying to\nmake some connected sense out of them, but finally he gave up and just\nsat and thought. The material seemed to be no help at all; it told him\neven less than Dr. O'Connor had.\n\nWhat he needed, he decided, was somebody to talk to. But who? He\ncouldn't talk to the FBI, and nobody else knew much about what he was\ntrying to investigate. He thought of Her Majesty and rejected the\nnotion with a sigh. No, what he needed was somebody smart and quick,\nsomebody who could be depended on, somebody with training and\nknowledge.\n\nAnd then, very suddenly, he knew who he wanted.\n\n\"Well, now, Sir Kenneth,\" he said. \"Let's put everything together and\nsee what happens.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Sir Kenneth Malone, \"it is high time we did so, Sirrah.\nProceed: I shall attend.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Let's start from the beginning,\" Malone said. \"We know there's\nconfusion in all parts of the country--in all parts of the world, I\nguess. And we know that confusion is being caused by carefully timed\naccidents and errors. We also know that these errors appear to be\naccompanied by violent bursts of psionic static--violent energy. And\nwe know, further, that on three specific occasions, these bursts of\nenergy were immediately followed by a reversal of policy in the mind\nof the person on the receiving end.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Sir Kenneth put in, \"that these gentlemen changed their\nopinions.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Malone said. \"I refer, of course, to the firm of Brubitsch,\nBorbitsch and Garbitsch, Spying Done Cheap.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"Then the operators of this strange force,\nwhatever it may prove to be, must have some interest in allowing the\nspies' confession?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Malone said. \"Let's leave that for later. To get back to the\nbeginning of all this: it seems to me to follow that the accidents and\nerrors which have caused all the confusion throughout the world happen\nbecause somebody's mind is changed just the right amount at the right\ntime. A man does something he didn't intend to do--or else he forgets\nto do it at all.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"We have done those things we ought not to\nhave done; we have left undone those things we ought to have done. And\nyou feel, Sirrah, that a telepathic command is the cause of this\nconfusion?\"\n\n\"A series of them,\" Malone said. \"But we also know, from Dr. O'Connor,\nthat it takes a great deal of psychic energy to perform this\nparticular trick--more than a person can normally afford to expend.\"\n\n\"Marry, now,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"Meseemeth this is not reasonable.\nChanging the mind of a man indeed seems a small thing in comparison to\nteleportation, or psychokinesis, or levitation or any such witchery.\nAnd yet it take more power than any of these?\"\n\nMalone thought for a second. \"Sure it does,\" he said. \"I'd say it was\na matter of resistance. Moving an inanimate object is pretty\nsimple--comparatively, anyhow--because inert matter has no mental\nresistance.\"\n\n\"And moving oneself?\" Sir Kenneth said.\n\n\"There's some resistance there, probably,\" Malone said. \"But you'll\nremember that the Fueyo system of training for teleportation involved\novercoming your own mental resistance to the idea.\"\n\n\"True,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"'Tis true. Then let us agree that it takes\ngreat power to effect this change. Where does our course point from\nthat agreement, Sirrah?\"\n\n\"Next,\" Malone said, \"we have to do a little supposing. This project\nmust be handled by a fairly large group, since no individual can do it\nalone. This large group has to be telepathic--and not only for the\nreasons Dr. O'Connor and I specified.\"\n\n\"And why else?\" Sir Kenneth demanded.\n\n\"They've also got to know exactly when to make this victim of theirs\nchange his mind,\" Malone said. \"Right?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Sir Kenneth said.\n\n\"We've got to look for a widespread organization of telepaths,\" Malone\nsaid, \"with enough mental discipline to hold onto a tough mental\nshield. Strong, trained, sane men.\"\n\n\"A difficult assignment,\" Sir Kenneth commented.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"suppose you hold on for a second--don't go\naway--and let me figure something out.\"\n\n\"I shall wait,\" sir Kenneth said, \"without.\"\n\n\"Without what?\" Malone murmured. But there was no time for games. Now,\nthen, he told himself--and sneezed.\n\nHe shook his head, cursed softly and went on.\n\nNow, then....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was an organization, spread all over the Western world, and with\nwhat were undoubtedly secret branches in the Soviet Union. The\norganization had to be an old one--because it had to have trained\ntelepaths, of a high degree of efficiency. And training took time.\n\nThere was something else to consider, too. In order to organize to\nsuch a degree that they could wreak the complete havoc they were\nwreaking, the organization couldn't be completely secret; there are\nalways leaks, always suspicious events, and a society that spent time\ncovering all of those up would have no time for anything else.\n\nSo the organization had to be a known one, in the Western world at\nleast--a known group, masquerading as something else.\n\nSo far, everything made sense. Malone frowned and tried to think.\nWhere, he wondered, did he go from here?\n\nMaybe this time a list would help. He found a pencil and a piece of\npaper, and headed the paper: _Organization_. Then he started putting\ndown what he knew about it, and what he'd figured out:\n\n1. Large\n2. Old\n3. Disguised\n\nIt sounded, so far, just a little like Frankenstein's Monster wearing\na red wig. But what else did he know about it?\n\nAfter a second's thought, he murmured: \"Nothing,\" and put the pencil\ndown.\n\nBut that, he realized, wasn't quite true. He knew one more thing about\nthe organization. He knew they'd probably be immune to the confusion\neverybody else was suffering from. The organization would be--had to\nbe--efficient. It would be composed of intelligent, superbly\nco-operative people, who could work together as a unit without in the\nleast impairing their own individuality.\n\nHe reached for the pencil again, and put down:\n\n4. Efficient\n\nHe looked at it. Now it didn't remind him so much of the Monster. But\nit didn't look terribly familiar, either. Who did he know, he thought,\nwho was large, old, disguised and efficient?\n\nIt sounded like an improbable combination. He set the paper down,\nclearing off some of the PRS books to make room for it. And then he\nstopped.\n\nThe papers the PRS had sent him....\n\nAnd he'd gotten them so quickly, so efficiently....\n\nThey were a large organization....\n\nAnd an old one....\n\nHe looked for a desk phone, found one and grabbed at it frantically.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl who answered the phone looked familiar. Malone suddenly\nremembered to check the time--it was just after nine. The girl stared\nat him. She did not look terribly old, but she was large and she had\nto be disguised. There seemed to be a lot of teeth running around in\nthis case, Malone thought, between the burlesque stripper in Las Vegas\nand Miss Dental Display here in New York. Nobody, he told himself,\ncould have collected that many teeth honestly.\n\n\"Psychical Research Society,\" she said. \"Oh, Mr. Malone. Good\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Sir Lewis,\" Malone said in a rush. \"Sir Lewis Carter. I want to talk\nto him. Hurry.\"\n\n\"Sir Lewis Carter?\" the girl said very slowly. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr.\nMalone, but he won't be in at all today.\"\n\n\"Home number,\" Malone said desperately. \"I've got to.\"\n\n\"Well, I can give you that, Mr. Malone,\" she said, \"but it wouldn't do\nyou any good, really. Because he went away on his vacation and when he\ndoes that he never tells us where. You know? He won't be back for two\nor three weeks,\" she added as an afterthought.\n\nMalone said: \"Oog,\" and thought for less than a second. \"Somebody\nofficial,\" he said. \"Got to talk to somebody official. Now.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't do that either, Mr. Malone,\" the toothy girl said. \"All\nof the executives already left on their vacation. They just left a\nskeleton force here at the office.\"\n\n\"They're all gone?\" Malone said hollowly.\n\n\"That's right,\" the girl said with great cheer. \"As a matter of fact,\nI'm in charge now. You know?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I do,\" Malone said. \"It's very important, though. You\ndon't have any idea where any of them went?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" she said. \"I'm sorry, but that's how it is. Maybe if\nyou were me you'd ask questions, but I just follow orders and those\nwere my orders. To take over until they get back. You know? They\ndidn't tell me where and I just didn't ask.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. He wanted to shoot himself. Everything was\nobvious now--about twenty-four hours too late. And now, they'd all\ngone--for two weeks--or for good.\n\nThe girl's rancid voice broke in on his thoughts.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"I'm sorry, but I just remembered they\nleft a note for you.\"\n\n\"A note?\" Malone said. \"For me?\"\n\n\"Sir Lewis said you might call,\" the girl said, \"and he left a\nmessage. If you'll hold on a minute I'll read it.\"\n\nMalone waited tensely. The girl found a slip of paper, blinked at it\nand read:\n\n\"My dear Malone, I'm afraid that what you have deduced is quite\ncorrect; and, as you can see, that leaves us no alternative. Sorry.\nMiss Luba A. sends her apologies to you, since she is joining us; my\napologies are also tendered.\" The girl looked up. \"It's signed by Sir\nLewis,\" she said. \"Does that mean anything to you, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it does,\" Malone said blankly. \"It means entirely too\nmuch.\"\n\n\nXIII\n\nAfter Miss Dental Display had faded from Malone's screen, he just sat\nthere, looking at the dead, gray front of the visiphone and feeling\nabout twice as dead and at least three times as gray.\n\nThings, he told himself, were terrible. But even that sentence, which\nwas a good deal more cheerful than what he actually felt, did nothing\nwhatever to improve his mood. All of the evidence, after all, had been\npractically living on the tip of his nose for God alone knew how long,\nand not only had he done nothing about it, he hadn't even seen it.\n\nThere was the organization, staring him in the face. There was\nLuba--nobody's fool, no starry-eyed dreamer of occult dreams. She was\npart of the Psychical Research Society, why hadn't he thought to\nwonder why she was connected with it?\n\nAnd there was his own mind-shield. Why hadn't he wondered whether\nother telepaths might not have the same shield?\n\nHe thought about Luba and told himself bitterly that from now on she\nwas Miss Ardanko. Enough, he told himself, was enough. From now on he\nwas calling her by her last name, formally and distantly. In his own\nmind, anyhow.\n\nFacts came tumbling in on him like the side of a mountain falling on a\nhapless traveler, during a landslide season. And, Malone told himself,\nhe had never possessed less hap in all of his ill-starred life.\n\nAnd then, very suddenly, one more fact arrived, and pushed the rest\nout into the black night of Malone's bitter mind. He stood up, pushing\nthe books away, and closed his eyes. When he opened them he went to\nthe telephone in his Las Vegas hotel suite, and switched it on. A\nsmiling operator appeared. Malone wanted to see him die of poison,\nslowly.\n\n\"Give me Room 4-T,\" he snapped. \"Hurry.\"\n\n\"Room forty?\" the operator asked.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Malone said, \"I said 4-T and I meant 4-T. Four as in four\nand T as in--as in China. And hurry.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the operator said. \"Yes, sir.\" He turned away from the screen.\n\"That would have been Miss Luba Ardanko's room, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"Right,\" Malone snapped. \"I ... wait a minute. Would have been?\"\n\n\"That's correct, sir,\" the operator said. \"She checked out, sir, early\nthis morning. The room is unoccupied.\"\n\nMalone swallowed hard. It was all true, then. Sir Lewis' note hadn't\nsimply been one last wave of the red cape before an angry bull. Luba\nwas one of them.\n\n_Miss Ardanko_, he corrected himself savagely.\n\n\"What time?\" he said.\n\nThe operator consulted an information board before him. \"Approximately\none o'clock, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"In the morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the clerk said.\n\nMalone closed his eyes. \"Thanks,\" he said.\n\n\"You're quite welcome, sir,\" the operator said. \"A courtesy of the\nGreat Universal Ho--\"\n\nMalone cut him off. \"Ho, indeed,\" he said bitterly. \"Not to mention ha\nand hee--hee and yippe-ki-yay. A great life.\" He whisked himself back\nto New York in a dismal, rainy state of mind. As he sat down again to\nthe books and papers the door to the room opened.\n\n\"You still here?\" the agent-in-charge said. \"I'm just going off duty\nand I came by to check. Don't you ever sleep?\"\n\n\"I'm on vacation, remember?\"\n\n\"Some vacation,\" the a-in-c said. \"If you're on special assignment why\nnot tell the rest of us?\"\n\n\"I want it to be a surprise,\" Malone said. \"And meantime, I'd\nappreciate it if I were left entirely to my own devices.\"\n\n\"Still conjuring up ghosts?\" the a-in-c said.\n\n\"That,\" Malone said, \"I don't know. I've got some long-distance calls\nto make.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe started with the overseas calls, leaving the rest of the United\nStates time for the sun to get round to them. His first call, which\ninvolved a lot of cursing on Malone's part and much hard work for the\noperator, who claimed plaintively that she didn't know how things had\ngotten so snarled up, but overseas calls were getting worse and worse,\nwent to New Scotland Yard in London. After great difficulty, Malone\nmanaged to get Assistant Commissioner C. E. Teal, who promised to\ncheck on the inquiry at once.\n\nIt seemed like years before he called back, and Malone leaped to the\nphone.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said.\n\nTeal, red-faced and apparently masticating a stick of gum, said: \"I\ngot C. I. D. Commander Gideon to follow up on that matter, Mr. Malone.\nAs you know, it's after noon here--\"\n\n\"And they're all out to lunch,\" Malone said.\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" Teal went on, \"they seem to have disappeared\nentirely. On vacation, that sort of thing. It is rather difficult\nattempting any full-scale tracing job just now; our men are terribly\noverworked. I imagine you've had reports from the New Scotland Yard\nrepresentatives working with you there--\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" Malone said. \"But the hour; what does that have to do\nwith anything?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I was thinking of our Inspector Ottermole,\" Teal said. \"He\nwas sent to locate Dr. Carnacki, President of the Psychical Research\nSociety here. On being told that Dr. Carnacki was 'out to lunch,'\nOttermole investigated every restaurant and eating-place within ten\nblocks of the offices. Dr. Carnacki was not present; he, like the rest\nof the Society here, appears to have left for places unknown.\"\n\n\"Thorough work,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ottermole's a good man,\" Teal said. \"We've checked as quickly as\npossible, Mr. Malone. I would like to ask you a question in return.\"\n\n\"Ask away,\" Malone said.\n\nTeal looked worried. \"Do you people think this may have anything to do\nwith the present ... ah ... trouble?\" he said. \"Things are quite upset\nhere, as you know; so many members of Parliament have resigned or ...\nah ... died that the realm is being run by a rather shakily assembled\ncoalition government. There is even some talk of giving executive\npower to Her Majesty until a general election can be held.\"\n\nFor one brief moment, Malone thought Teal was talking about Rose\nThompson. Then he recalled Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and felt\nbetter. Things weren't quite as bad as he'd thought.\n\nBut they were bad enough. \"We simply don't know yet,\" he said\nuntruthfully. \"But as soon as anything definite comes up, of course,\nyou'll be informed.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Malone,\" Teal said. \"Of course, we'll do the same.\"\nAnd then, still masticating, he switched off.\n\nParis was next, then Rome, Berlin and a couple more. Every one had the\nsame result. From Maigret of the Paris Suret\u00e9 to Poirot in Belgium,\nfrom Berlin's strict officialdom to the cheerful Hollanders, all the\nreports were identical. The PRS of each country had gone underground.\n\nMalone buried his face in his hands, thought about a cigar and decided\nthat even a cigar might make him feel worse. Where were they? What\nwere they doing now? What did they plan to do?\n\nWhere had they gone?\n\n\"Out of the everywhere,\" he heard himself say in a hollow, sepulchral\nvoice, \"into the here.\"\n\nBut where was the here?\n\nHe tried to make up his mind whether or not that made sense.\nSuperficially, it sounded like extremely bad English, but he wasn't\nsure of anything any more. Things were getting much too confused.\n\nHe close his eyes wearily, and vanished.\n\nWhen he opened them, he was in his Washington apartment. He went over\nto the big couch and sat down, feeling that if he were going to curse\nhe might as well be comfortable while he did it. But, some minutes\nlater, when the air was a bright electric blue around him, he didn't\nfeel any better. Cursing was not the answer.\n\nNothing seemed to be.\n\nWhat was his next move?\n\nWhere did he go from here?\n\nThe more he thought about it, the more his mind spun. He was, he\nrealized, at an absolute, total dead end.\n\nOh, there were things he could do. Malone knew that very well. He\ncould make a lot of noise and go through a lot of waste motion; that\nwas what it amounted to. He could have all the homes of all the\nmissing PRS members checked somehow. That would undoubtedly result in\nthe startling discovery that the PRS members involved weren't home. He\ncould have their dossiers sent to him, which would clutter everything\nwith a great many more pieces of paper. But he felt quite sure that\nthe pieces of paper would do no good at all. In general, he could\nraise all hell--and find nothing whatever.\n\nNow, he told himself sadly, he had the evidence to start the FBI in\nmotion. The only trouble was that he could think of nowhere for them\nto go.\n\nAnd, though he had evidence that might convince Burris--the PRS\nmembers, after all, _had_ done a rather unusual fadeout--he had\nnowhere near enough to carry the case into court, much less make a\ntry at getting the case to stand up once carried in. That was one\nthing he couldn't do, he realized, he couldn't issue warrants for the\narrest of anybody at all.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut, vacation or no vacation, he thought solemnly, he was an FBI\nAgent, and his motto was: \"There's always a way.\" No normal method of\ntracking down the PRS members, or finding their present whereabouts,\nwas going to work. They'd been covering themselves for such an\nemergency, undoubtedly, for a good many years--and if anyone got\nclose, a burst of mental energy was quite enough to turn the seeker\naside.\n\nNobody, Malone told himself grimly, was perfect. There were clues\nlying around somewhere; he was sure of that. There had to be. The\nproblem was simply to figure out where to look, and how to look, and\nwhat to look for.\n\nSomewhere, the clues were sitting quietly and waiting for him to find\nthem. The thought cheered him slightly, but not very much. He stood up\nslowly and went into the kitchen to start heating water for coffee.\nThere was, he told himself, a long night ahead of him. He sighed\ngently. But there was no help for it; the work had to be done--and\ndone quickly.\n\nBut when eight cigars had been reduced to ash, and what seemed like\nseveral gallons of coffee had sloshed their way into Malone's interior\nworkings, his mind was as blank as a baby's. The lovely, opalescent\ndawn began to show in the East, and Malone tendered it some extremely\nrude words. Then, Haggard, red-eyed, confused, violently angry, and\nnot one inch closer to a solution, he fell into a fitful doze on his\ncouch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he awoke, the sun was high in the sky, and outside his window the\ncheerful sound of too much traffic floated in the air. Downstairs\nsomebody was playing a television set too loudly, and the voice\nreached Malone's semiaware mind in a great tinny shout:\n\n\"The President, taking action on the current crisis, has declared martial\nlaw throughout the nation,\" a voice said in an important-sounded\nmonotone. \"Exempt from this proclamation are members of the Armed\nServices, Special Agents and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The\nproclamation, issued this morning, was made public in a special news\nconference which--\"\n\nMalone ripped out a particularly foul oath and sat up on the couch.\n\"That,\" he muttered, \"is a fine thing to wake up to.\" He focused his\neyes, with only slight difficulty, on his watch. The time was a little\nafter two.\n\n\"Later developments will be reported as and when they occur,\" the\nannouncer was saying, \"and in one hour a special panel of newscasters\nwill be assembled here to discuss this latest action in the light of\npresent happenings. Any special rules and regulations will be\nbroadcast over this station--\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Malone said. He had wasted a lot of time doing nothing but\nsleeping, he told himself. This was no time to be listening to\ntelevision. He got up and found, to his vague surprise, that he felt a\nlot better and clearer-headed than he had been. Maybe the sleep had\nactually done him some good.\n\nHe yawned, blinked and stretched, and then padded into the bathroom\nfor a shower and shave. After he'd changed he thought about a morning\nor afternoon cup of coffee, but last night's dregs appeared to have\ntaken up permanent residence in his digestive tract, and he decided\nagainst it at last. He swallowed some orange juice and toast and\nthen, heaving a great sigh of resignation and brushing crumbs off his\nshirt, he teleported himself over to his office.\n\nNow he knew that, sooner or later, he was going to have to talk to\nBurris. Burris _had_ to know, even if there was nothing to be done.\n\nAnd now was just as good--or as bad--a time as any.\n\nHe didn't hesitate. He punched the button on his intercom for Burris'\noffice and then sat back, with his eyes closed, waiting for the\nwell-known voice.\n\nIt didn't come.\n\nInstead, Wolf, the Director's secretary, spoke up.\n\n\"Burris isn't in, Malone,\" he said. \"He had to fly to Miami. I can get\na call through to him on the plane, if it's urgent, but he'll be\nlanding in about fifteen minutes. And he did say he'd call in this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure. O.K. It isn't urgent.\" He was just as glad\nof the reprieve; it gave him one more chance to work matters through\nto a solution, and hand it to Burris on a silver platter. \"But why\nMiami?\" he added.\n\n\"Don't you hear about anything any more?\" Wolf asked.\n\n\"I've been on vacation.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Wolf said. \"Well, the Governor of Mississippi was assassinated\nyesterday, at Miami Beach.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. He thought about it for a second. \"Frankly,\" he\nsaid, \"this does not strike me as an irreparable loss to the nation.\nNot even to Mississippi.\"\n\n\"You express my views precisely,\" Wolf said.\n\n\"How about the killer?\" Malone said. \"I gather they haven't got him\nyet, or Burris wouldn't be on his way down.\"\n\n\"No,\" Wolf said. \"The killer would be on his way here instead. But you\nknow how things are--everything's confused. Governor Flarion was\nwalking along Collins Avenue when somebody fired at him, using a\nhigh-powered rifle with, I guess, a scope sight.\"\n\n\"Professional,\" Malone commented.\n\n\"It looks like it,\" Wolf said. \"And he picked the right time for it,\ntoo--the way things are he was just one more confusion among the rest.\nNobody even heard the sniper's shot; the governor just fell over,\nright there in the street. And by the time his bodyguards found out\nwhat had happened, it was impossible even to be sure just which way he\nwas facing when the shot had been fired.\"\n\n\"And as I remember Collins Avenue--\" Malone started.\n\n\"Right,\" Wolf said. \"But it's even worse now, with everything going\nnuts. Out where Governor Flarion was taking his stroll, there's an\nawful lot of it to search. The boys are trying to find somebody who\nsaw a man acting suspicious in any of the nearby buildings, or heard a\nshot, or saw anybody at all lurking or loitering anywhere near to the\nscene.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" Malone said. \"Sounds like a nice complicated job.\"\n\n\"You don't know the half of it,\" Wolf said. \"There's also the Miami\nBeach Chamber of Commerce. According to them, Flarion died of a heart\nattack, and not even in Miami Beach. Everything happening down there\nisn't happening, according to them; Miami Beach is the one unsullied\nbeauty spot in a mixed-up United States.\"\n\n\"All I can say,\" Malone offered, \"is good luck. This is the saddest\nday in American history since the assassination of Huey P. Long.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Wolf said. \"Want me to tell Burris you called?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said, and switched off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe assassination of Nemours P. Flarion, he told himself, obviously\nmeant something. It pointed straight toward some entirely new kind of\nanswer. Granted, old Nemours P. had been a horrible mistake, a\nparanoid, self-centered, would-be, dictator whose final act was quite\nin keeping with the rest of his official life. Who else would be in\nMiami Beach, far away from his home state, while the President was\ndeclaring nationwide martial law?\n\nBut that, Malone told himself, wasn't the point. Or not quite the\npoint, anyhow.\n\nMaybe some work would dig up more facts. Anyhow, Malone was reasonably\nsure that he could reassign himself from vacation time, at least until\nhe called Burris. And he had work to do; nobody was going to hand him\nanything on a silver serving salver.\n\nHe punched the intercom again and got the Records office.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" a familiar voice said.\n\n\"Potter,\" Malone said, \"this is Malone. I want facsimiles of\neverything we have on the Psychical Research Society, on Sir Lewis\nCarter, and on Luba Ardanko. Both of these last are connected with the\nSociety.\"\n\n\"You're back on duty, Malone?\" Potter said.\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"Make that fast, will you?\"\n\nPotter nodded. \"Right away,\" he said.\n\nIt didn't take long for the facsimile records to arrive, and Malone\nwent right to work on them. Maybe somewhere in those records was the\nclue he had desperately needed. Where was the PRS? What were they\ndoing now? What did they plan to do?\n\nAnd why had they started the whole row in the first place?\n\nThe PRS, he saw, was even more widely spread than he had thought. It\nhad branches in almost every major city in the United States, in\nEurope, South Africa, South America and Australia. There was even a\nsmall branch society in Greenland. True, the Communist disapproval of\nsuch nonmaterialistic, un-Marxian objectives as Psychical Research\nshowed up in the fact that there were no registered branches in the\nSino-Soviet bloc. But that, Malone thought, hardly mattered. Maybe in\nRussia they called themselves the Lenin Study Group, or the Better\nBorschch League. He was fairly sure, from all the evidence, that the\nPRS had some kind of organization even behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nMoney backing didn't seem to be much of a problem, either. Malone\nchecked for the supporters of the organization and found a microfilmed\nlist that ran into the hundreds of thousands of names, most of them\nordinary people who seemed to be interested in spiritualism and the\nlike, and who donated a few dollars apiece to the PRS. Besides this\nmass of small donations, of course, there were a few large ones, from\nindependently wealthy men who gave support to the organization and\nseemed actively interested in its aims.\n\nIt wasn't an unusual picture; just an exceptionally big one.\n\nMalone sighed and went on to the personal dossiers.\n\nSir Lewis Carter himself was a well-known astronomer and\nmathematician. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Royal\nAstronomical Society and the Royal Mathematical Society. He had been\nknighted for his contributions in higher mathematics only two years\nbefore he had come to live in the United States. Malone went over the\npapers dealing with his entry into the country carefully, but they\nwere all in order and they contained absolutely nothing in the way of\nusable clues.\n\nSir Lewis' books on political and historical philosophy had been\nwell-received, and he had also written a novel, \"But Some Are More\nEqual,\" which, for a few weeks after publication, had managed to claw\nits way to the bottom of the best-seller list.\n\nAnd that was that. Malone tried to figure out whether all this\ninformation did him any good, and the answer came very quickly. The\nanswer was no. He opened the second dossier.\n\nLuba Ardanko had been born in New York. Her mother had been a woman of\nIrish descent named Mary Foley, and had died in '69. Her father had\nbeen a Hungarian named Chris Yorgen Ardanko, and had died in the same\nyear.\n\nMalone sighed. Somewhere in the dossiers, he was sure, there was a\nclue, the basic clue that would tell him everything he needed to know.\nHis prescience had never been so strong; he knew perfectly well that\nhe was staring at the biggest, most startling and most complete\ndisclosure of all. And he couldn't see it.\n\nHe stared at the folders for a long minute. What did they tell him?\nWhat was the clue.\n\nAnd then, very slowly, the soft light of a prodigal sun illuminated\nhis mind.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" Malone said gently, \"you are a damned fool. There are\ntimes when it is necessary to discard the impossible after you have\nseen that the obscure is the obvious.\"\n\nHe wasn't sure whether that meant anything, or even whether he knew\nwhat he was saying. But, as the entire structure of facts became\nclear, and then turned right upside down in his mind and changed into\nsomething else entirely--something that told him not only who, and\nwhere, but also why, he became absolutely sure of one thing.\n\nHe knew the final answer.\n\nAnd it _was_ obvious. Obvious as all hell!\n\n\nXIV\n\nThere was, of course, only one thing to do and only one place to go.\nMalone teleported to the New York offices of the FBI and went\nimmediately downstairs to the garage, where a specially-built Lincoln\nawaited him at all times.\n\nOne of the mechanics looked up curiously as Malone headed for the car.\n\"Want a driver?\" he said.\n\nMalone thanked his lucky stars that he didn't have to get into any\nlengthy and time-consuming argument about whether or not he was on\nvacation. \"No, thanks,\" he said. \"This is a solo job.\"\n\nThat, he told himself, was for sure. He drove out onto the streets and\ninto the heavy late-afternoon traffic of New York. The Lincoln handled\nsmoothly, but Malone didn't press his luck in the traffic which he\nthought was even worse than the mess he'd driven through with the\nhappy cab driver two days before. He wasn't in any hurry now, after\nall. He had all the time in the world, and he knew it. They--and, for\nonce, Malone could put real names to that \"they\"--would still be\nwaiting for him when he got there.\n\n_If_ he got there, he thought suddenly, turning a corner and being\nconfronted with a great mass of automobiles wedged solidly fender to\nfender as far as the eye could see. The noise of honking horns was\ndeafening, and great clouds of smoke rose up to make the scene look\nlike the circle of Hell devoted to hot-rod drivers. Malone cursed and\nsweated until the line began to move, and then cursed and sweated some\nmore until he was out of the city at last.\n\nIt took quite a lot of time. New York traffic, in the past forty-eight\nhours, hadn't gotten better; it had gotten a lot worse. He was nearly\nexhausted by the time he finally crossed the George Washington Bridge\nand headed west. And, while he drove, he began to let his reflexes\ntake over most of the automotive problems now that New York City was\nbehind him.\n\nHe took all his thoughts from behind the shield that had sheltered\nthem and arrayed them neatly before him. They were beamed, he told\nhimself firmly, to one particular group of persons and to no one else.\nEverything was perfectly clear; all he had to do now was explain it.\n\nMalone had wondered, over the years, about the detectives in books.\nThey always managed to wrap everything up in the last chapter, which\nwas perfectly all right by itself. But they always had a whole crowd\nof suspects listening to them, too. Malone knew perfectly well that he\ncould never manage a setup like that. People would interrupt him.\nThings would happen. Two dogs would rush in and start a battle royal\non the floor. There would be an earthquake or an invasion of little\ngreen Venusians, or else somebody would just decide to faint and\ncause a furor.\n\nBut now, at long last, he realized, he had his chance. Nobody could\ninterrupt him. And he could explain to his heart's content.\n\nBecause the members of the PRS were telepathic. And Kenneth J. Malone,\nhe thought happily, was not.\n\nLuba, he was sure, would be tuned in on him as he drove toward their\nPennsylvania hiding place. At least, he wanted to think so; it made\nthings much more pleasant. And he hoped that Luba, or whoever was\nreally tuned in, would alert everybody else, so they could all hook in\nand hear his grand final explanation of everything.\n\nHe opened his mind in that one special direction, beaming his thoughts\nto nobody else but the group he'd decided on. A second of silence\npassed.\n\nAnd then a sound began. Malone had passed a company of soldiers some\nyards back, but he hadn't noticed them particularly; with the country\nunder martial law, soldiers were going to be as common as tree frogs.\nNow, however, something different was happening.\n\nMalone felt the car tremble slightly, and stopped. Past him, rolling\nalong the side of the highway he was on, came a parade of thirty-ton\ntanks. They rumbled and roared their slow, elephantine way down the\nhighway and, after what seemed about three days, disappeared from\nsight. Malone wondered what the tanks were for, and then dismissed it\nfrom his mind. It certainly wasn't very pleasant to think about, no\nmatter how necessary it turned out to be.\n\nHe started up again. There were few cars on the road, although a lot\nof them were parked along the sides. A series of _Closed_ signs on\nfilling stations explained that, and Malone began to be grateful for\nthe national emergency. It allowed him to drive without much\ninterference, anyhow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_And a hearty good afternoon to all, he thought--especially to Miss\nLuba Ardanko. I hope she's tuned in ... and, if she isn't, I hope\nsomebody alerts her. Frankly, I'd rather talk to her than to anyone\nelse I can think of at the moment. As a matter of fact, it's a little\neasier to concentrate if I talk out loud, so I think I'll do that._\n\nHe swerved the car at this point, neatly avoiding a broken wooden\ncrate that crouched in wait for him. \"Road hog,\" he told it bitterly,\nand went on.\n\n\"Nothing personal,\" he went on after a second. \"I don't care if you're\n_all_ listening in, as a matter of fact. And I'm not going to hide\nanything.\" He thought a second, and then added: \"Frankly, I'm not sure\nI've got anything to hide.\"\n\nHe paused and, in his imagination, he could almost hear Luba's voice.\n\n_I'm listening, Kenneth,_ she said. _Go on._\n\nHe fished around in his mind for a second, wondering exactly where to\nstart. Then he decided, in the best traditions of the detective story,\nnot to mention \"Alice in Wonderland,\" to start at the beginning.\n\n\"The dear old Psychical Research Society,\" he said, speaking earnestly\nto his windshield, \"has been going on for a good many years now--since\nthe 1880's, as a matter of fact. That's a long time and it adds up to\na lot of Psychical Research. A lot of famous and intelligent people\nhave belonged to the Society. And, with all that, it's hardly\nsurprising that, after nearly a hundred years of work, something\nfinally turned up.\"\n\nAt this point, there was another interruption. A couple of sawhorses\nblocked the road ahead of Malone. As he stared at them, he felt his\nprescience begin to itch. He took out his .44 Magnum and slowed the\ncar, memorizing the road as he passed it. He stopped the car before\nthe sawhorses. Three enlisted men carrying M-1 rifles, and a stern,\npale captain, his bars pointing sideways and glittering on his\nshoulders, appeared from the sides of the road.\n\nThe captain's voice was a military bark. \"Out of the car!\"\n\nMalone began to obey.\n\n\"With your hands up!\" the captain snapped. Malone dropped the .44\nunobtrusively into his jacket pocket and complied. Then, as he came\nout of the car, he teleported himself back to a section of the road\nhe'd memorized, ten feet behind the car. The four men were gaping,\ndumbfounded, as Malone drew his gun and shot them. Then he removed the\nsawhorses, got back in his car, reloaded the .44, put it back in his\nholster and drove on.\n\n\"Now,\" he said in a thoughtful tone. \"Where was I?\"\n\nHe imagined Luba's voice saying: _You were telling us how, all this\ntime, it's hardly surprising--_\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"Well, then. So you solved some of the problems,\nyou'd set. You learned how to use and control telepathy and\nteleportation, maybe, long before scientific boys like Dr. O'Connor\nbecame interested. But you never announced it publicly. You kept the\nknowledge all to yourself. 'Is this what the common folk call\ntelepathy, Lord Bromley?' 'Yes, Lady Bromley.' 'Much too good for\nthem, isn't it?' And maybe it is, at that; I don't know.\"\n\nHis thoughts, he recognized, were veering slightly. After a second he\ngot back on the track.\n\n\"At any rate,\" he went on, \"you--all of your out there--are\nresponsible for what's happening to this country and all of Europe and\nAsia--and, for all I know, the suburbs of Hell.\n\n\"I remember one of the book facsimiles you got me, for instance,\" he\nsaid. \"The writer tried for an 'expose' of the Society, in which he\nattempted to prove that Sir Lewis Carter and certain other members\nwere trying to take over the world and run it to suit themselves,\nusing their psionic powers to institute a rather horrible type of\ndictatorship over the world.\n\n\"It was a pretty convincing book in a lot of ways. The author\nevidently know a lot about what he was dealing with.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this point, Malone ran into another roadblock. There had been a\nfight of some kind up ahead, and a lot of cars with what looked like\nshell-holes in them were piled on one side of the road. The State\nPolice were working under the confused direction of an Army major to\nstraighten things out, while a bulldozer pushed the cars off the road\nonto the grass bordering it. The major stopped what he was doing and\ncame to meet Malone as the car stopped.\n\n\"Get off the road,\" the major said surlily.\n\nMalone looked up at him. \"I've got some identification here,\" he said.\n\"Mind if I get it out?\"\n\nThe major reached for a gun and held it. \"Go ahead,\" he said. \"Don't\ntry anything funny. It's been hell up and down this road, mister.\"\n\nMalone flipped out his wallet and showed the identification.\n\n\"FBI?\" the Major said. \"What're you doing out here?\"\n\n\"Special assignment,\" Malone said. \"Oh ... by the way ... you might\nsend some men back a ways. There are four dead mean in military\nuniforms lying on the road near a couple of sawhorses.\"\n\nThe major stared. \"Dead?\" he said at last. \"Dead how?\"\n\n\"I shot them,\" Malone said.\n\n\"You--\" The major's finger tightened on the trigger of his gun.\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"I said they were in military\nuniforms. I didn't say they were soldiers.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Three enlisted men carrying M-1 rifles?\" Malone said. \"When the M-1's\nout of date? And a captain with his bars on sideways? No, major.\nThose were renegades. Looters of some kind; they wanted to kill me and\nget the car and any valuables I happened to have.\"\n\nThe major, very slowly, relaxed his grip on the gun and his arm fell\nto his side. \"You did the smart thing, Mr. Malone,\" he said.\n\n\"And I've got to go on doing it,\" Malone said. \"I'm in a hurry.\"\n\nHe noticed a newspaper fluttering at the side of the road, not too\nnear the cars. Somehow it made everything seem even more lonely and\nstrange. The headlines fluttered into sight:\n\n     MARTIAL LAW EDICT\n\n     \"MUST BE OBEYED,\" SAYS GOVERNOR\n\n     But Riots Are Feared In Outlying Towns\n\n     MAN AND WIFE CONFESS KILLING OF RELATIVES ABOARD PRIVATE\n     PLANE:\n\n     Force Kin To Drop Off\n\nThere was a photo of a woman there, too, and Malone could read just a\nlittle of the caption:\n\n\"Obeying the edict of martial law laid down by the President, Miss\nHelen A.--\"\n\nHe wondered vaguely if her last name were Handbasket.\n\nThe major was looking at him. \"O.K., then,\" he said.\n\n\"I can go on?\" Malone said.\n\nThe major looked stern. \"Drive on,\" he said.\n\nMalone got the car going; the roadblock was lifted for him and he went\non by.\n\nAfter a moment, he said: \"Pardon the interruption. I trust that all\nthe devoted listeners to Uncle Kenneth's Happy Hour are still tuned\nin.\"\n\n_Go ahead,_ said Lou's voice.\n\n\"All right, let's take a look at what you've been doing. You've caused\npeople to change their minds about what they've been intending to do.\nYou can cause all sorts of hell to break loose that way. You have a\nlot of people you want to get rid of, so you play on their neuroses\nand concoct errors for them to fight. You rig things so that they\nquit, or get fired, or lose elections, or get arrested, or just\ngenerally get put out of circulation. Some of the less stable ones\njust up and did away with themselves.\n\n\"Sometimes, it's individuals who have to go. Sometimes, it's whole\ngroups or maybe even whole nations. And sometimes it's in between, and\nyou manage to foul up organizational moves with misplaced papers,\nmis-sent messages, errors, changed minds, and everything else you can\nthink of.\n\n\"You know,\" he went on, \"at first I couldn't see any pattern in what\nwas going on--though I remember telling myself that there was a kind\nof justice in the way this thing was just as hard on gangsters as it\nwas on businessmen and Congressmen.\n\n\"The Congressman from Gahoochie County, Arkansas, gets himself in a\njam over fraudulent election returns on the same day that the\naccountant for the Truckers Union sends Mike Sands' books to the\nAttorney General. Simple justice, I call it.\n\n\"And, you know, seen from that viewpoint, this whole caper might come\nout looking pretty good. If most of the characters you've taken care\nof are just the boys who needed taking care of, I'd say more power to\nyou--except for one thing. It's all right to get rid of all the fools,\nidiots, maniacs, blockheads, morons, psychopaths, paranoids,\ntimidity-ridden, fear-worshipers, fanatics, thieves, and the rest of\nthe general, all-round, no-good characters; I'm all for it. But not\nthis way. Oh, no.\n\n\"You've pressed the panic button, that's what you've done.\n\n\"You've done more damage in two weeks than all those fumblebrains have\nbeen able to do in several myriads of lifetimes. You've loused up the\neconomy of this nation and every other civilized nation. You've caused\nriots in which innocent people have died; you've caused thousands more\nto lose their businesses and their savings. And only God Himself knows\nhow many more are going to die of starvation and murder before this\nthing is over.\n\n\"And you can't tell me that _all_ of those people deserve to die.\"\n\nHe slowed down as he came to a small town, and for the first time in\nmany miles he focused on the road ahead with his full mind. The town,\nhe saw, looked like a shambles. There were four cars tastefully\narranged on the lawn of what appeared to be the local library. Across\nthe street, a large drugstore was in flames, and surprised people were\nhurrying to put it out. There didn't seem to be any State Police or\nArmy men around, but they'd passed through; Malone saw a forgotten\noverseas cap lying on the road ahead.\n\nWith a shock, he realized that he was now in Pennsylvania, close to\nwhere he wanted to go. A signboard told him the town he was looking at\nwas Milford. It was a mess, and Malone hoped fervently that it was a\nmess that could eventually be cleaned up.\n\nThe town was a small one, and Malone was glad to get out of it so\nquickly.\n\n\"That's the kind of thing I mean,\" he said aloud. Then he paused. \"Are\nyou there, anybody?\"\n\nHe imagined he heard Luba's voice saying: _Yes, Ken. Yes, I'm here.\nListening to you._\n\nImagination was fine but, of course, there was no way for them to get\nthrough to him. They were telepathic, but Kenneth J. Malone, he told\nhimself sadly, was not.\n\n\"Hello, out there,\" he went on. \"I hope you've been listening so far,\nbecause there isn't too much more for me to say.\n\n\"Just this: you've wrecked my country, and you've wrecked almost all\nof the rest of civilization. You've brought my world down around my\nears.\n\n\"I have every logical reason to hate your guts. By all the evidence I\nhave, you are a group of the worst blackguards who ever existed; by\nall the evidence, I should be doing everything in my power to\nexterminate you.\n\n\"But I'm not.\n\n\"My prescience tells me that what you've been doing is right and\nnecessary. I'm damned if I can see it, but there it is. I just hope\nyou can explain it to me.\"\n\n\nXV\n\nSoon, he was in the midst of the countryside. It was, of course,\nfilled with country. It spread around him in the shape of hills,\nbirds, trees, flowers, grass, billboards and other distractions to the\npassing motorist.\n\nIt took Malone better than two hours more to find the place he was\nlooking for. Long before he found it, he had come to the conclusion\nthat finding country estates in Pennsylvania was only a shade easier\nthan finding private homes in the Borough of Brooklyn. In both cases,\nhe had found himself saddled with the same frantic search down what\nseemed likely routes which turned out to lead nowhere. He had found,\nin both cases, complete ignorance of the place on the part of local\ncitizens, and even strong doubts that the place could possibly have\nany sort of existence.\n\nThe fact that is was growing dark didn't help much, either.\n\nBut he found it at last. Rounding a curve in a narrow, blacktop road,\nhe saw the home behind a grove of trees.\n\nHe recognized it instantly.\n\nHe had seen it so often that he felt as if he knew it intimately.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt was a big, rambling, Colonial-type mansion, painted a blinding and\nbeautiful white, with a broad, pillared porch and a great carved front\ndoor. The front windows were curtained in rich purples, and before the\nhouse was a great front garden, and tall old trees. Malone\nhalf-expected Scarlett O'Hara to come tripping out of the house at any\nminute shouting: \"Rhett! The children's mush is on fire!\" or something\nequally inappropriate.\n\nInside it, however, if Malone were right, was not the magnetic\nScarlett. Inside the house were some of the most important members of\nthe PRS--and one person who was not a member.\n\nBut it was impossible to tell from the outside. Nothing moved on the\nwell-kept grounds, and the windows didn't show so much as the flutter\nof a purple curtain. There was no sound. No cars were parked around\nthe house--nor, Malone realized, thinking of \"Gone With the Wind,\"\nwere there any horses or carriages.\n\nThe place looked deserted.\n\nMalone thought he knew better, but it took a few minutes for him to\nget up enough courage to go up the long driveway. He stared at the\nhouse. It was an old one, he knew, built long before the Civil War and\noriginally commanding a huge tract of land. Now, all that remained of\nthe vast acreage was the small portion that surrounded the house.\n\nBut the original family still inhabited it, proud of the house and of\ntheir part in its past. Over the years, Malone knew, they had kept it\nup scrupulously, and the place had been both restored and modernized\non the inside without harming the classic outlines of the\nhundred-and-fifty-year-old structure.\n\nA fence surrounded the estate, but the front gate was swinging open.\nMalone saw it and took a deep breath. Now, he told himself, or never.\nHe drove the Lincoln through the opening slowly, alert for almost\nanything.\n\nThere was no disturbance. Thirty yards from the front door he pulled\nthe car to a cautious stop and got out. He started to walk toward the\nbuilding. Each step seemed to take whole minutes, and everything he\nhad thought raced through his mind again. Nothing seemed to move\nanywhere, except Malone himself.\n\nWas he right? Were the people he'd been beaming to really here? Or had\nhe been led astray by them? Had he been manipulated, in spite of his\nshield, as easily as they had manipulated so many others?\n\nThat was possible. But it wasn't the only possibility.\n\nSuppose, he thought, that he was perfectly right, and that the group\nwas waiting inside. And suppose, too, that he'd misunderstood their\nmotives.\n\nSuppose they were just waiting for him to get a little closer.\n\nMalone kept walking. In just a few steps, he could be close enough so\nthat a bullet aimed at him from the house hadn't a real chance of\nmissing him.\n\nAnd it didn't have to be bullets, either. They might have set a trap,\nhe thought, and were waiting for him to walk into it. Then they would\nhold him prisoner while they devised ways to....\n\nTo what?\n\nHe didn't know. And that was even worse; it called up horrible terrors\nfrom the darkest depths of Malone's mind. He continued to walk\nforward.\n\nFinally he reached the steps that led up to the porch, and took them\none at a time.\n\nHe stood on the porch. A long second passed.\n\nHe took a step toward the high, wide and handsome oaken door. Then he\ntook another step, and another.\n\nWhat was waiting for him inside?\n\nHe took a deep breath, and pressed the doorbell button.\n\nThe door swung open immediately, and Malone involuntarily stepped\nback.\n\nThe owner of the house smiled at him from the doorway. Malone let out\nhis breath in one long sigh of relief.\n\n\"I was hoping it would be you,\" he said weakly. \"May I come in?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly, Malone. Come on in. We've been expecting you, you\nknow,\" said Andrew J. Burris, Director of the FBI.\n\n\nXVI\n\nMalone sat, quietly relaxed and almost completely at ease, in the\ndepths of a huge, comfortable, old-fashioned Morris chair. Three\nsimilar chairs were clustered around a squat, massive coffee table,\nmade of a single slab of dark wood set on short, curved legs. Malone\nlooked around at the other three with a relaxed feeling of\nrecognition: Andrew J. Burris, Sir Lewis Carter and Luba Ardanko.\n\nSir Lewis softly exhaled a cloud of smoke as he removed the briar from\nhis mouth. \"Malone,\" he asked gently, \"how did you know we would be\nhere?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I just ... I mean, it was obvious as soon as\nI--\" He stopped, frowning. \"I had one thing to go on, anyway,\" he\nsaid. \"I figured out the PRS was responsible for all the troubles\nbecause it was so efficient. And then, while I was sitting and staring\nat the file reports, it suddenly came to me: the FBI was just as\nefficient. So it was obvious.\"\n\n\"What was?\" Burris said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I thought you'd been keeping me on vacation because\nyour mind was being changed,\" he said. \"Now I can see you were doing\nit of your own free will.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Sir Lewis said. \"But how did you know you'd find us _here_,\nMalone?\"\n\nThere was a shadow in the room, but not a visible one. Malone felt the\nchill of sudden danger. Whatever was going to happen, he realized, he\nwould not be around for the finish. He, Kenneth Joseph Malone, the\ncuddly, semi-intrepid FBI Agent he had always known and loved, would\nnever get out of this deadly situation. If he lived, he would be so\nchanged that--\n\nHe didn't even want to think about it.\n\n\"What sort of logic,\" Sir Lewis was saying, \"led you to the belief\nthat we would all be here, in Andrew's house?\"\n\nMalone forced his mind to consider the question. \"Well,\" he began, \"it\nisn't exactly logic, I guess.\"\n\nLuba smiled at him. He felt a little reassured, but not much. \"You\nshould have phrased that differently,\" she said. \"It's: 'It isn't\nexactly logic. I guess.'\"\n\n\"Not guess,\" Sir Lewis said. \"You know. Prescience, Malone. Your\nprecognitive faculty.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said. \"All right. So what?\"\n\n\"Take it easy,\" Burris put in. \"Relax, Malone. Everything's going to\nbe all right.\"\n\nSir Lewis waved a hand negligently. \"Let's continue,\" he said. \"Tell\nme, Malone: if you were a mathematics professor, teaching a course in\ncalculus, how would you grade a paper that had all the answers but\ndidn't show the work?\"\n\n\"I never took calculus,\" Malone said. \"But I imagine I'd flunk him.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Sir Lewis said.\n\n\"Because if he can't back up his answer,\" Malone said slowly, \"then\nit's no better than a layman's guess. He has to give reasons for his\nanswers; otherwise nobody else can understand him.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Perfectly fine. Now--\" he puffed at his\npipe--\"can you give me a logical reason for arriving at the decision\nyou made a few hours ago?\"\n\nThe danger was coming closer, Malone realized. He didn't know what it\nwas or how to guard himself against it. All he could do was answer,\nand play for time.\n\n\"While I was driving up here,\" he said, \"I sent you a message. I told\nyou what I knew and what I believed about the whole world picture as\nit stands now. I don't know if you received it, but I--\"\n\nLuba spoke without the trace of a smile. \"You mean you didn't know?\"\nshe said. \"You didn't know I was answering you?\"\n\nThat was the first pebble of the avalanche, Malone knew suddenly--the\navalanche that was somehow going to destroy him. \"You forced your\nthoughts into my mind, then,\" he said as coolly as he could. \"Just as\nyou forced decision on the rest of society.\"\n\n\"Now, dammit, Malone!\" Burris said suddenly. \"You know those bursts\ntake a lot of energy, and only last for a fraction of a second!\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Then you ... didn't--\"\n\n_Of course I didn't force anything on you, Kenneth. I can't. Not all\nthe power of the entire PRS could force anything through your shield.\nBut you opened it to me._\n\nIt was Luba's mental \"voice.\" Malone opened his mouth, shut it and\nthen, belatedly, snapped shut the channel through which he'd contacted\nher. Luba gave him a wry look, but said nothing. \"You mean I'm a\ntelepath?\" Malone asked weakly.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Sir Lewis snapped. \"At the moment, you can only pick up\nLuba--but you are certainly capable of picking up anyone, eventually.\nJust as you learned to teleport, you can learn to be a telepath.\nYou--\"\n\nThe room was whirling, but Malone tried to keep his mind steady. \"Wait\na minute,\" he said. \"If you received what I sent, then you know I've\ngot a question to ask.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\nFinally Sir Lewis looked up. \"You want to know why you felt we--the\nPRS--were innocent of the crimes you want to charge us with. Very\nwell.\" He paused. \"We have wrecked civilization: granted. We could\nhave done it more smoothly: granted.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\nSir Lewis' face was serious and steady. Malone tensed.\n\n\"Malone,\" Sir Lewis said, \"do you think you're the only one with a\nmental shield?\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"I guess stress--fixity of mind or\npurpose--could develop it in anyone,\" he said. \"At least, in some\npeople.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Now, among the various people of the\nworld who have, through one necessity or another, managed to develop\nsuch shields--\"\n\nBurris broke in impatiently. His words rang, and then echoed in the\nold house.\n\n\"Some fool,\" he said flatly, \"was going to start the Last War.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So you had to stop it,\" Malone said after a long second. \"But I still\ndon't see--\"\n\n\"Of course you don't,\" Sir Lewis said. \"But you've got to understand\nwhy you don't see it first.\"\n\n\"Because I'm stupid,\" Malone said.\n\nLuba was shaking her head. Malone turned to face her. \"Not stupid,\"\nshe said. \"But some people, Kenneth, have certain talents. Others\nhave--other talents. There's no way of equating these talents; all are\nuseful, each performs a different function.\"\n\n\"And my talent,\" Malone said, \"is stupidity. But--\"\n\nShe lit a cigarette daintily. \"Not at all,\" she said. \"You've done a\nreally tremendous job, Kenneth. I was trained ever since I was a baby\nto use my psionic abilities--the PRS has known how to train children\nin that line ever since 1970. Only Mike Fueyo developed a system for\ninstruction independently; the boy was, and is, a genius, as you've\nnoticed.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"You, however,\" Luba said, \"have the distinction of being the first\nhuman being who has, as an adult, achieved his full powers without\nchildhood training. In addition, you're the only human being who has\never developed to the extent you have--in precognition, too.\"\n\nShe puffed on the cigarette. Malone waited.\n\n\"But what you don't have,\" she said at last, very carefully, \"is the\nability to reason out the steps you've taken, after you've reached the\nproper conclusion.\"\n\n\"Like the calculus student,\" Malone said. \"I flunk.\" Something inside\nhim grated over the marrow in his bones. It was as though someone had\ndecided that the best cure for worry was coarse emery in the joints,\nand he, Kenneth J. Malone, had been picked for the first experiment.\n\n\"You're not flunking,\" Luba said. \"You're a very long way from\nflunking, Kenneth.\"\n\nBurris cleared his throat suddenly. Malone turned to him. The Head of\nthe FBI stuck an unlighted cigar into his mouth, chewed it a little,\nand then said: \"Malone, we've been keeping tabs on you. Your shield\nwas unbreakable--but we have been able to reach the minds of people\nyou've talked to: Mike Sands, Primo Palveri, and so on. And Her\nMajesty, of course: you opened up a gap in your shield to talk to her,\nand you haven't closed it down. Until you started broadcasting here on\nthe way up, naturally.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said, waiting with as much patience as possible\nfor the point.\n\n\"I tried to take you off the case,\" Burris went on, \"because Sir Lewis\nand the others felt you were getting too close to the truth. Which you\nwere, Malone, which you were.\" He lit his cigar and looked obscurely\npleased. \"But they didn't know how you'd take it,\" he said. \"They ...\nwe ... felt that a man who hadn't been trained since childhood to\naccept the extrasensory abilities of the human mind couldn't possibly\nlearn to accept the reality of the job the PRS has to do.\"\n\n\"I still don't,\" Malone said. \"I'm stupid. I flunk. Remember?\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" Burris said helplessly. \"Not at all, Malone. But we were\nworried. I lied to you about those three spies--I put the drug in the\nwater-cooler. I tried to keep you from learning the Fueyo method of\nteleportation. I didn't want you to learn that you were telepathic.\"\n\n\"But I did,\" Malone said, \"And what does that make me?\"\n\n\"That,\" Sir Lewis cut in, \"is what we're attempting to find out.\"\n\nMalone felt suitably crushed, but he wasn't sure by what. \"I've got\nsome questions,\" he said after a second. \"I want to know three\nthings.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Sir Lewis said.\n\n\"One:\" Malone said, \"How come Her Majesty and the other nutty\ntelepaths didn't spot you? Two: How come you sent me out on these jobs\nwhen you were afraid I was dangerous? And three: What was it that was\nso safe about busting up civilization? How did that save us from the\nLast War?\"\n\nSir Lewis nodded. \"First,\" he said, \"we've developed a technique of\nthrowing up a shield and screening it with a surface of innocuous\nthoughts--like hiding behind a movie screen. Second ... well, we had\nto get the jobs done, Malone. And Andrew thought you were the most\ncapable, dangerous or not. For one thing, we wanted to get all the\ninsane telepaths in one place; it's difficult to work when the\natmosphere's full of such telepathic ravings.\"\n\n\"But wrecking the world because of a man with a mind-shield--why not\njust work things so his underlings wouldn't obey him?\" Malone shook\nhis head. \"That sounds more reasonable.\"\n\n\"It may,\" Sir Lewis said. \"But it wouldn't work. As a matter of fact,\nit was tried, and it didn't work. You see, the Sino-Soviet top men\nwere smart enough to see that their underlings were being tampered\nwith. And they've developed a system, partly depending on automatic\nfiring systems, partly on individuals with mind-blocks--that is,\npeople who aren't being tampered with--which we can't disrupt\ndirectly. So we had to smash them.\"\n\n\"And the United States at the same time,\" Burris said. \"The economic\nbalance had to be kept; a strong America would be forced in to fill\nthe power vacuum otherwise, and that would make for an even worse\ncatastrophe. And if we weren't in trouble, the Sino-Soviet Bloc would\nblame their mess on us. And that would start the Last War before\ncollapse could get started. Right, Malone?\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone said, thinking that he almost did. He told himself he\ncould feel happy now; the danger--which hadn't been danger to him,\nreally, but danger from him toward the PRS, toward civilization--was\nover. But he didn't feel happy. He didn't feel anything.\n\n\"There's a crisis building in New York,\" Sir Lewis said suddenly,\n\"that's going to take all our attention. Malone, why don't you ...\nwell, go home and get some rest? We're going to be busy for a while,\nand you'll want to be fresh for the work coming up.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said listlessly. \"Sure.\"\n\nAs the others rose, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then\nhe vanished.\n\n\nXVII\n\nTwo hours passed, somehow. Bourbon and soda helped them pass, Malone\ndiscovered; he drank two high-balls slowly, trying not to think about\nanything. He felt terrible. After a while he made himself a third\nhigh-ball and started on it. Maybe this would make him feel better.\nMaybe he thought, he ought to break out his cigars and celebrate.\n\nBut there didn't seem to be very much to celebrate somehow. He felt\nlike an amoeba on a slide being congratulated on having successfully\nconquered the world.\n\nHe drank some more bourbon-and-soda. Amoebae, he told himself, didn't\ndrink bourbon-and-soda. He was better off than an amoeba. He was\nhappier than an amoeba. But somehow he couldn't imagine any amoeba in\nthe world, no matter how heart-broken, feeling any worse than Kenneth\nJ. Malone.\n\nHe looked up. There was another amoeba in the room.\n\nThen he frowned. She wasn't an amoeba, he thought. She was the\nscientist the amoeba was supposed to fall in love with, so the\nscientist could report on everything he did, so all the other\nscien--psiontists could know all about him. But whoever heard of a\nscien--psiontist--falling in love with an amoeba? Nobody. It was fate.\nAnd fate was awful. Malone had often suspected it, but now he was\nsure. Now he was looking at things from the amoeba's side, and fate\nwas terrible.\n\n\"No, Ken,\" the psiontist said. \"It needn't be at all like that.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it need,\" Malone said positively. \"It need be even worse.\nWhen I have some more to drink, it'll _be_ even worse. Wait and see.\"\n\n\"Ken,\" Luba said softly, \"you don't have to suffer this way.\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said agreeably, \"I don't. You could shoot me and then I'd\nbe dead. Just quit all this amoebing around, O.K.?\"\n\n\"You're already half shot,\" Luba said sharply. \"Now be quiet and\nlisten. You're angry because you've fallen in love with me and you're\nall choked up over the futility of it all.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said. \"Ex-positively-actly. You're a psionic\nsuper-man--woman. You can figure things out in your own little head\ninstead of just getting along on dum psionic luck like us amoebae.\nYou're too far above me.\"\n\n\"Ken, listen!\" Luba snapped. \"Look into my mind. You can link up with\nme: go ahead and do it. You can read me clear down to the subconscious\nif you want to.\"\n\nMalone blinked.\n\n\"Now, Ken!\" Luba said.\n\nMalone looked. For a long time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour later, Kenneth J. Malone, alone in his room, was humming\nhappily to himself as he brushed a few specks of dust from the top of\nhis best royal blue bowler. He faced the mirror on the wall, puffed on\nthe cigar clenched between his teeth, and adjusted the bowler to just\nthe right angle.\n\nThere was a knock on the door. He went and opened it, carefully\ndisposing of the cigar first. \"Oh,\" he said. \"What are you doing\nhere?\"\n\n\"Just saying hello,\" Thomas Boyd grinned. \"Back at work?\"\n\nBoyd didn't know, of course, what had happened. Nor need he ever know.\n\"Just about,\" Malone said. \"Spending the evening relaxing, though.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" Boyd said. \"Let me guess. Her name begins with L?\"\n\n\"It does not,\" Malone said flatly.\n\n\"But--\" Boyd began.\n\nMalone cast about in his mind for an explanation. Telling Boyd the\ntruth--that Luba and Kenneth J. Malone just weren't equals as far as\nsocial intercourse went--would leave him exactly nowhere. But,\nsomehow, it had to be said. \"Tom,\" he said, \"suppose you met a\nbeautiful girl--charming, wonderful, brilliant.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Boyd said. \"I like it already.\"\n\n\"Suppose she looked about ... oh ... twenty-three,\" Malone went on.\n\n\"Do any more supposing,\" Boyd said, \"and I'll be pawing the ground.\"\n\n\"And then,\" Malone said, very carefully, \"suppose you found out, after\nyou'd been out with her ... well, when you took her out, say, you met\nyour grandmother.\"\n\n\"My grandmother,\" Boyd said virtuously, \"doesn't go to joints like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Use your imagination,\" Malone snapped. \"And suppose your grandmother\nrecognized the girl as an old schoolmate of hers.\"\n\nBoyd swallowed hard. \"As a what?\"\n\n\"An old schoolmate,\" Malone said. \"Suppose this girl were so charming\nand everything just because she'd had ... oh, ninety years or so to\npractice in.\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Boyd said in a depressed tone, \"you can spoil more ideas--\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"would you go out with her again?\"\n\n\"You kidding?\" Boyd said. \"Of course not.\"\n\n\"But she's the same girl,\" Malone said. \"You've just found out\nsomething new about her, that's all.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"So,\" he said, \"you found out something new about Luba.\nLike, maybe, she's ninety years old?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"Nothing like that. Just--something.\" He remembered\nQueen Elizabeth's theory of politeness toward superiors: people, she'd\nsaid, act as if they believed their bosses were superior to them, but\nthey didn't believe it.\n\nOn the other hand, he thought, when a man knows and believes that\nsomeone actually _is_ superior--then, he doesn't mind at all. He can\ndepend on that superiority to help him. And love, ordinary\nman-and-woman love, just can't exist.\n\nNor, Malone told himself, would anyone want it to. It would, after\nall, be damned uncomfortable.\n\n\"So who's the girl?\" Boyd said. \"And where? The clubs are all closed,\nand the streets probably aren't very safe just now.\"\n\n\"Barbara Wilson,\" Malone said, \"and Yucca Flats. I ought to be able to\nget a fast plane.\" He shrugged. \"Or maybe teleport,\" he added.\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"But on a night with so many troubles--\"\n\n\"Oh, King Henry,\" Malone said, \"hearken. A man who looks as historical\nas you do ought to know a little history.\"\n\n\"Such as?\" Boyd said, bristling slightly.\n\n\"There have always been troubles,\" Malone said. \"In the Eighth\nCentury, it was Saracens; in the Fourteenth, the Black Death. Then\nthere was the Reformation, and the Prussians in 1870, and the Spanish\nin 1898, and--\"\n\n\"And?\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone took a deep breath. He could almost feel the court dress\nflowing over him, as the court manners did. Lady Barbara, after all,\nattendant to Her Majesty, would expect a certain character from him.\n\nAfter a second, he had it.\n\n\"In 1914, it was enemy aliens,\" said Sir Kenneth Malone.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Occasion for Disaster, by \nGordon Randall Garrett and Laurence Mark Janifer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OCCASION FOR DISASTER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30434-8.txt or 30434-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/4/3/30434/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
