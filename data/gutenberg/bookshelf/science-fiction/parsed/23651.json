The captain\nwanted to ask but something stopped him. Behind him Doctor\nJohannsen sat at his desk, his gnarled old hand tight about a\nwhiskey bottle, the bottle the doctor always had in his desk but\nnever brought out except when he was alone, and waited for Captain\nBaird to ask his question. Captain Baird turned at last.\n\n\"They are our markings?\" Captain Baird asked. It was not the\nquestion. Captain Baird knew the markings of the Rocket Testing\nStation as well as the doctor did.\n\n\"Yes,\" the doctor said, \"they are our markings. Identical. But not\nour paint.\"\n\nCaptain Baird turned back to the window. Six months ago it had\nhappened. Ten minutes after launching, the giant test rocket had\nbeen only a speck on the observation screen. Captain Baird had\nturned away in disgust.\n\n\"A mouse!\" the captain had said, \"unfortunate a mouse can't\nobserve, build, report. My men are getting restless, Johannsen.\"\n\n\"When we are ready, Captain,\" the doctor had said.\n\nIt was twelve hours before the urgent call from Central Control\nbrought the captain running back to the laboratory. The doctor was\nthere before him. Professor Schultz wasted no time, he pointed to\nthe instrument panel. \"A sudden shift, see for yourself. We'll\nmiss Mars by a million and a quarter at least.\"\n\nTwo hours later the shift in course of the test rocket was\napparent to all of them and so was their disappointment.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"According to the instruments the steering shifted a quarter of an\ninch. No reason shows up,\" Professor Schultz said.\n\n\"Flaw in the metal?\" Doctor Johannsen said.\n\n\"How far can it go?\" Captain Baird asked.\n\nProfessor Schultz shrugged. \"Until the fuel runs out, which is\nprobably as good as never, or until the landing mechanism is\nactivated by a planet-sized body.\"\n\n\"Course? Did you plot it?\" The doctor asked.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" Professor Schultz said, \"as close as I can\ncalculate it is headed for Alpha Centauri.\"\n\nCaptain Baird turned away. The doctor watched him.\n\n\"Perhaps you will not be quite so hasty with your men's lives in\nthe future, Captain?\" the doctor said.\n\nProfessor Schultz was spinning dials. \"No contact,\" the professor\nsaid, \"No contact at all.\"\n\nThat had been six months ago. Three more test rockets had been\nfired successfully before the urgent report came through from\nAlaskan Observation Post No. 4. A rocket was coming across the\nPole.\n\nThe strange rocket was tracked and escorted by atomic armed\nfighters all the way to the Rocket Testing Station where it cut\nits own motors and gently landed. In the center of a division of\natomic-armed infantry the captain, the doctor, and everyone else,\nwaited impatiently. There was an air of uneasiness.\n\n\"You're sure it's not ours?\" Captain Baird asked.\n\nThe doctor laughed. \"Identical, yes, but three times the size of\nours.\"\n\n\"Perhaps one of the Asian ones?\"\n\n\"No, it's our design, but too large, much too large.\"\n\nProfessor Schultz put their thoughts into words. \"Looks like\nsomeone copied ours. Someone, somewhere. It's hard to imagine, but\ntrue nevertheless.\"\n\nThey waited two weeks. Nothing happened. Then a radiation-shielded\nteam went in to examine the rocket. Two more weeks and the strange\nrocket was dismantled and spread over the field of the testing\nstation. The rocket was dismantled and the station had begun to\ntalk to itself in whispers and look at the sky.\n\nCaptain Baird stood now at the window and looked out at the\ndismantled rocket. He looked but his mind was not on the parts of\nthe rocket he could see from the window.\n\n\"The materials, they're not ours?\" the captain asked.\n\n\"Unknown here,\" the doctor said.\n\nThe captain nodded. \"Those were our instruments?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The doctor still held the whiskey bottle in a tight grip.\n\n\"They sent them back,\" the captain said.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nThe doctor crashed the bottle hard against the desk top. \"Ask it,\nCaptain, for God's sake!!\"\n\nThe captain turned to face the doctor directly. \"It was a man, a\nfull grown man.\"\n\nThe doctor sighed as if letting the pent-up steam of his heart\nescape. \"Yes, it is a man. It breathes, it eats, it has all the\nattributes of a man. But it is not of our planet.\"\n\n\"Its speech ...\" the captain began.\n\n\"That isn't speech, Captain,\" the doctor broke in, breaking in\nsharply, \"It's only sound.\" The doctor stopped; he examined the\nlabel of his bottle of whiskey very carefully. A good brand of\nwhiskey. \"He seems quite happy in the storeroom. You know,\nCaptain, what puzzled me at first? He can't read. He can't read\nanything, not even the instruments in that ship. In fact he shows\nno interest in his rocket at all.\"\n\nThe captain sat down now. He sat at the desk and faced the doctor.\n\"At least _they_ had the courage to send a man, not a mouse.\nDoctor, a man.\"\n\nThe doctor stared at the captain, his hand squeezing and\nunsqueezing on the whiskey bottle. \"A man who can't read his own\ninstruments?\" The doctor laughed. \"Perhaps you too have failed to\nsee the point? Like that stupid general who sits out there waiting\nfor the men from somewhere to invade?\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's a possibility?\"\n\nThe doctor nodded. \"A very good possibility, Captain, but they\nwill not be men.\" The doctor seemed to pause and lean forward.\n\"That rocket, Captain, is a test rocket. A test rocket _just like\nours_!\"\n\nThen the doctor picked up his whiskey bottle at last and poured\ntwo glasses.\n\n\"Perhaps a drink, Captain?\"\n\nThe captain was watching the sky outside the window.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Test Rocket!, by Jack Douglas\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TEST ROCKET! ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23651.txt or 23651.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/6/5/23651/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, dpcfmander, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
