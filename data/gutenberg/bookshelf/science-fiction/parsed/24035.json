Grandpa always\n    said Pirates were really benefactors, though...._\n\n\nIllustrated by Freas\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nIt was not mere impulsive action when Bron Hoddan started for the planet\nWalden by stowing away on a ship that had come to his native planet to\nhang all his relatives. He'd planned it long before. It was a\nlong-cherished and carefully worked out scheme. He didn't expect the\nhanging of his relatives, of course. He knew that they'd act grieved and\ninnocent, and give proof that they were simple people leading blameless\nlives. They'd make their would-be executioners feel ashamed and\napologetic for having thought evil of them, and as soon as the strangers\nleft they'd return to their normal way of life, which was piracy. But\nwhile this was going on, Bron Hoddan stowed away on the menacing vessel.\nPresently he arrived at its home world. But his ambition was to reach\nWalden, so he set about getting there. It took a long time because he\nhad to earn ship-passage from one solar system to another, but he held\nto his idea. Walden was the most civilized planet in that part of the\ngalaxy. On Walden, Hoddan intended, in order (a) to achieve splendid\nthings as an electronic engineer, (b) to grow satisfactorily rich, (c)\nto marry a delightful girl, and (d) end his life a great man. But he had\nto spend two years trying to arrange even the first.\n\nOn the night before the police broke in the door of his room, though,\naccomplishment seemed imminent. He went to bed and slept soundly. He was\ncalmly sure that his ambitions were about to be realized. At practically\nany instant his brilliance would be discovered and he'd be well-to-do,\nhis friend Derec would admire him, and even Nedda would probably decide\nto marry him right away. She was the delightful girl. Such prospects\nmade for good sleeping.\n\nAnd Walden was a fine world to be sleeping on. Outside the capital city\nits spaceport received shipments of luxuries and raw materials from\nhalfway across the galaxy. Its landing grid reared skyward and tapped\nthe planet's ionosphere for power with which to hoist ships to clear\nspace and pluck down others from emptiness. There was commerce and\nmanufacture and wealth and culture, and Walden modestly admitted that\nits standard of living was the highest in the Nurmi Cluster. Its\ncitizens had no reason to worry about anything but a supply of\ntranquilizers to enable them to stand the boredom of their lives.\n\nEven Hoddan was satisfied, as of the moment. On his native planet there\nwasn't even a landing grid. The few, battered, cobbled ships the\ninhabitants owned had to take off precariously on rockets. They came\nback blackened and sometimes more battered still, and sometimes they\nwere accompanied by great hulls whose crews and passengers were\nmysteriously missing. These extra ships had to be landed on their\nemergency rockets, and, of course, couldn't take off again, but they\nalways vanished quickly just the same. And the people of Zan, on which\nHoddan had been born, always affected innocent indignation when\nembattled other spacecraft came and furiously demanded that they be\nproduced.\n\nThere were some people who said that all the inhabitants of Zan were\nspace pirates and ought to be hung and compared with such a planet,\nWalden seemed a very fine place indeed. So on a certain night Bron\nHoddan went confidently to bed and slept soundly until three hours after\nsunrise. Then the police broke in his door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey made a tremendous crash in doing it, but they were in great haste.\nThe noise waked Hoddan, and he blinked his eyes open. Before he could\nstir, four uniformed men grabbed him and dragged him out of bed. They\nsearched him frantically for anything like a weapon. Then they stood him\nagainst a wall with two stun-pistols on him, and the main body of cops\nbegan to tear his room apart, looking for something he could not guess.\nThen his friend Derec came hesitantly in the door and looked at him\nremorsefully. He wrung his hands.\n\n\"I had to do it, Bron,\" he said agitatedly. \"I couldn't help doing it!\"\n\nHoddan blinked at him. He was dazed. Things didn't become clearer when\nhe saw that a cop had slit open his pillow and was sifting its contents\nthrough his fingers. Another cop was ripping the seams of his mattress\nto look inside. Somebody else was going carefully through a little pile\nof notes that Nedda had written, squinting at them as if he were afraid\nof seeing something he'd wish he hadn't.\n\n\"What's happened?\" asked Hoddan blankly. \"What's this about?\"\n\nDerec said miserably:\n\n\"You killed someone, Bron. An innocent man! You didn't mean to, but you\ndid, and ... it's terrible!\"\n\n\"Me kill somebody? That's ridiculous!\" protested Hoddan.\n\n\"They found him outside the powerhouse,\" said Derec bitterly. \"Outside\nthe Mid-Continent station that you--\"\n\n\"Mid-Continent? Oh!\" Hoddan was relieved. It was amazing how much he was\nrelieved. He'd had an unbelieving fear for a moment that somebody might\nhave found out he'd been born and raised on Zan--which would have ruined\neverything. It was almost impossible to imagine, but still it was a\ngreat relief to find out he was only suspected of a murder he hadn't\ncommitted. And he was only suspected because his first great achievement\nas an electronic engineer had been discovered. \"They found the thing at\nMid-Continent, eh? But I didn't kill anybody. And there's no harm done.\nThe thing's been running two weeks, now. I was going to the Power Board\nin a couple of days.\" He addressed the police. \"I know what's up, now,\"\nhe said. \"Give me some clothes and let's go get this straightened out.\"\n\nA cop waved a stun-pistol at him.\n\n\"One word out of line, and--_pfft!_\"\n\n\"Don't talk, Bron!\" said Derec in panic. \"Just keep quiet! It's bad\nenough! Don't make it worse!\"\n\nA cop handed Hoddan a garment. He put it on. He became aware that the\ncop was scared. So was Derec. Everybody in the room was scared except\nhimself. Hoddan found himself incredulous. People didn't act this way on\nsuper-civilized, highest-peak-of-culture Walden.\n\n\"Who'd I kill?\" he demanded. \"And why?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't know him, Bron,\" said Derec mournfully. \"You didn't mean\nto do murder. But it's only luck that you killed only him instead of\neverybody!\"\n\n\"Everybody--\" Hoddan stared.\n\n\"No more talk!\" snapped the nearest cop. His teeth were chattering.\n\"Keep quiet or else!\"\n\nHoddan shut up. He watched--dressing the while as his clothing was\ninspected and then handed to him--while the cops completed the\nexamination of his room. They were insanely thorough, though Hoddan\nhadn't the least idea what they might be looking for. When they began to\nrip up the floor and pull down the walls, the other cops led him\noutside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a fleet of police trucks in the shaded street outdoors. They\npiled him in one, and four cops climbed after him, keeping stun-pistols\ntrained on him during the maneuver. Out of the corner of his eye he saw\nDerec climbing into another truck. The entire fleet sped away together.\nThe whole affair had been taken with enormous seriousness by the police.\nTraffic was detoured from their route. When they swung up on an elevated\nexpressway, with raised-up trees on either side, there was no other\nvehicle in sight. They raced on downtown.\n\nThey rolled off the expressway. They rolled down a cleared avenue.\nHoddan recognized the Detention Building. Its gate swung wide. The truck\nhe rode in went inside. The gate closed. The other trucks went\naway--rapidly. Hoddan alighted and saw that the grim gray wall of the\ncourtyard had a surprising number of guards mustered to sweep the open\nspace with gunfire if anybody made a suspicious movement.\n\nHe shook his head. Nobody had mentioned Zan, so this simply didn't make\nsense. His conscience was wholly clear except about his native planet.\nThis was insanity! He went curiously into the building and into the\nhearing room. His guards, there, surrendered him to courtroom guards and\nwent away with almost hysterical haste. Nobody wanted to be near him.\n\nHoddan stared about. The courtroom was highly informal. The justice sat\nat an ordinary desk. There were comfortable chairs. The air was clean.\nThe atmosphere was that of a conference room in which reasonable men\ncould discuss differences of opinion in calm leisure. Only on a world\nlike Walden would a prisoner brought in by police be dealt with in such\nsurroundings.\n\nDerec came in by another door, with a man Hoddan recognized as the\nattorney who'd represented Nedda's father in certain past interviews.\nThere'd been no mention of Nedda as toying with the thought of marrying\nHoddan then, of course. It had been strictly business. Nedda's father\nwas Chairman of the Power Board, a director of the Planetary Association\nof Manufacturers, a committeeman of the Banker's League, and other\nimportant things. Hoddan had been thrown out of his offices several\ntimes. He now scowled ungraciously at the lawyer who had ordered him\nthrown out. He saw Derec wringing his hands.\n\nAn agitated man in court uniform came to his side.\n\n\"I'm the Citizen's Representative,\" he said uneasily. \"I'm to look after\nyour interests. Do you want a personal lawyer?\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Hoddan. He felt splendidly confident.\n\n\"The charges-- Do you wish a psychiatric examination--claiming no\nresponsibility?\" asked the Representative anxiously. \"It might ... it\nmight really be best--\"\n\n\"I'm not crazy,\" said Hoddan, \"though this looks like it.\"\n\nThe Citizen's Representative spoke to the justice.\n\n\"Sir, the accused waives psychiatric examination, without prejudice to a\nlater claim of no responsibility.\"\n\nNedda's father's attorney watched with bland eyes. Hoddan said\nimpatiently:\n\n\"Let's get started so this will make some sense! I know what I've done.\nWhat monstrous crime am I charged with?\"\n\n\"The charges against you,\" said the justice politely, \"are that on the\nnight of Three Twenty-seven last, you, Bron Hoddan, entered the\nfenced-in grounds surrounding the Mid-Continent power receptor station.\nIt is charged that you passed two no-admittance signs. You arrived at a\ndoor marked 'Authorized Personnel Only.' You broke the lock of that\ndoor. Inside, you smashed the power receptor taking broadcast power from\nthe air. This power receptor converts broadcast power for industrial\nunits by which two hundred thousand men are employed. You smashed the\nreceptor, imperiling their employment.\" The justice paused. \"Do you wish\nto challenge any of these charges as contrary to fact?\"\n\nThe Citizen's Representative said hurriedly:\n\n\"You have the right to deny any of them, of course.\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" asked Hoddan. \"I did them! But what's this about me\nkilling somebody? Why'd they tear my place apart looking for something?\nWho'd I kill, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Don't bring that up!\" pleaded the Citizen's Representative. \"Please\ndon't bring that up! You will be much, much better off if that is not\nmentioned!\"\n\n\"But I didn't kill anybody!\" insisted Hoddan.\n\n\"Nobody's said a word about it,\" said the Citizen's Representative,\njittering. \"Let's not have it in the record! The record has to be\npublished.\" He turned to the justice. \"Sir, the facts are conceded as\nstated.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the justice to Hoddan, \"do you choose to answer these\ncharges at this time?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Hoddan. \"Of course!\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said the justice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan drew a deep breath. He didn't understand why a man's death,\ncharged to him, was not mentioned. He didn't like the scared way\neverybody looked at him. But--\n\n\"About the burglary business,\" he said confidently. \"What did I do in\nthe power station before I smashed the receptor?\"\n\nThe justice looked at Nedda's father's attorney.\n\n\"Why,\" said that gentleman amiably, \"speaking for the Power Board as\ncomplainant, before you smashed the standard receptor you connected a\ndevice of your own design across the power-leads. It was a receptor unit\nof an apparently original pattern. It appears to have been a very\ninteresting device.\"\n\n\"I'd offered it to the Power Board,\" said Hoddan, with satisfaction,\n\"and I was thrown out. You had me thrown out! What did it do?\"\n\n\"It substituted for the receptor you smashed,\" said the attorney. \"It\ncontinued to supply some two hundred million kilowatts for the\nMid-Continent industrial area. In fact, your crime was only discovered\nbecause the original receptor--naturally--had to be set to draw peak\npower at all times, with the unused power wasted by burning carbon. Your\ndevice adjusted to the load and did not burn carbon. So when the\nattendants went to replace the supposedly burned carbon and found it\nunused, they discovered what you had done.\"\n\n\"It saved carbon, then,\" said Hoddan triumphantly. \"That means it saved\nmoney. I saved the Power Board plenty while that was connected. They\nwouldn't believe I could. Now they know. I did!\"\n\nThe justice said:\n\n\"Irrelevant. You have heard the charges. In legal terms, you are charged\nwith burglary, trespass, breaking and entering, unlawful entry,\nmalicious mischief, breach of the peace, sabotage, and endangering the\nemployment of citizens. Discuss the charges, please!\"\n\n\"I'm telling you!\" protested Hoddan. \"I offered the thing to the Power\nBoard. They said they were satisfied with what they had and wouldn't\nlisten. So I proved what they wouldn't listen to! That receptor saved\nthem ten thousand credits worth of carbon a week! It'll save half a\nmillion credits a year in every power station that uses it! If I know\nthe Power Board, they're going right on using it while they arrest me\nfor putting it to work!\"\n\nThe courtroom, in its entirety, visibly shivered.\n\n\"Aren't they?\" demanded Hoddan belligerently.\n\n\"They are not,\" said the justice, tight-lipped. \"It has been smashed in\nits turn. It has even been melted down.\"\n\n\"Then look at my patents!\" insisted Hoddan. \"It's stupid--\"\n\n\"The patent records,\" said the justice with unnecessary vehemence, \"have\nbeen destroyed. Your possessions have been searched for copies. Nobody\nwill ever look at your drawings again--not if they are wise!\"\n\n\"Wha-a-at?\" demanded Hoddan incredulously. \"Wha-a-at?\"\n\n\"I will amend the record of this hearing before it is published,\" said\nthe justice shakily. \"I should not have made that comment. I ask\npermission of the Citizen's Representative to amend.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" said the Representative before he had finished.\n\nThe justice said quickly:\n\n\"The-charges-have-been-admitted-by-the-defendant.\nSince-the-complainant-does-not-wish-punitive-action-taken-against-him--\"\n\n\"He'd be silly if he did,\" grunted Hoddan.\n\n\"And-merely-wishes-security-against-repetition-of-the-offense,\nI-rule-that-the-defendant-may-be-released-upon-posting-suitable-bond-for\n-good-behavior-in-the-future. That-is, he-will-be-required-to-post-bond\n-which-will-be-forfeited-if-he-ever-again-enters-a-power-station\n-enclosure-passes-no-trespassing-signs-ignores-no-admittance-signs\n-and/or-smashes-apparatus-belonging-to-the-complainant.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Hoddan indignantly. \"I'll raise it somehow. If they're\ntoo stupid to save money-- How much bond?\"\n\n\"The-court-will-take-it-under-advisement-and-will-notify-the-defendant\n-within-the-customary-two-hours,\" said the justice at top speed. He\nswallowed. \"The-defendant-will-be-kept-in-close-confinement-until-the\n-bond-is-posted. The-hearing-is-ended.\"\n\nHe did not look at Hoddan. Courtroom guards put stun-pistols against\nHoddan's body and ushered him out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently his friend Derec came to see him in the tool-steel cell in\nwhich he had been placed. Derec looked white and stricken.\n\n\"I'm in trouble because I'm your friend, Bron,\" he said miserably, \"but\nI asked permission to explain things to you. After all, I caused your\narrest. I urged you not to connect up your receptor without permission!\"\n\n\"I know,\" growled Hoddan, \"but there are some people so stupid you have\nto show them everything. I didn't realize that there are people so\nstupid you can't show them anything.\"\n\n\"You ... showed something you didn't intend,\" said Derec miserably.\n\"Bron, I ... I have to tell you. When they went to charge the carbon\nbins at the power station, they ... they found a dead man, Bron!\"\n\nHoddan sat up.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Your machine--killed him. He was outside the building at the foot of a\ntree. Your receptor killed him through a stone wall! It broke his bones\nand killed him.... Bron--\" Derec wrung his hands. \"At some stage of\npower-drain your receptor makes deathrays!\"\n\nHoddan had had a good many shocks today. When Derec arrived, he'd been\nincredulously comparing the treatment he'd received and the panic about\nhim, with the charges made against him in court. They didn't add up.\nThis new, previously undisclosed item left him speechless. He goggled at\nDerec, who fairly wept.\n\n\"Don't you see?\" asked Derec pleadingly. \"That's why I had to tell the\npolice it was you. We can't have deathrays! The police can't let anybody\ngo free who knows how to make them! This is a wonderful world, but there\nare lots of crackpots. They'll do anything! The police daren't let it\neven be suspected that deathrays can be made! That's why you weren't\ncharged with murder. People all over the planet would start doing\nresearch, hoping to satisfy all their grudges by committing suicide for\nall their enemies with themselves! For the sake of civilization your\nsecret has to be suppressed--and you with it. It's terrible for you,\nBron, but there's nothing else to do!\"\n\nHoddan said dazedly:\n\n\"But I only have to put up a bond to be released!\"\n\n\"The ... the justice,\" said Derec tearfully, \"didn't name it in court,\nbecause it would have to be published. But he's set your bond at fifty\nmillion credits! Nobody could raise that for you, Bron! And with the\nreason for it what it is, you'll never be able to get it reduced.\"\n\n\"But anybody who looks at the plans of the receptor will know it can't\nmake deathrays!\" protested Hoddan blankly.\n\n\"Nobody will look,\" said Derec tearfully. \"Anybody who knows how to make\nit will have to be locked up. They checked the patent examiners. They've\nforgotten. Nobody dared examine the device you had working. They'd be\njailed if they understood it! Nobody will ever risk learning how to make\ndeathrays--not on a world as civilized as this, with so many people\nanxious to kill everybody else. You have to be locked up forever, Bron.\nYou have to!\"\n\nHoddan said inadequately:\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I beg your forgiveness for having you arrested,\" said Derec in abysmal\nsorrow, \"but I couldn't do anything but tell--\"\n\nHoddan stared at his cell wall. Derec went away weeping. He was an\nadmirable, honorable, not-too-bright young man who had been Hoddan's\nonly friend.\n\nHoddan stared blankly at nothing. As an event, it was preposterous, and\nyet it was wholly natural. When in the course of human events somebody\ndoes something that puts somebody else to the trouble of adjusting the\nnumb routine of his life, the adjustee is resentful. The richer he is\nand the more satisfactory he considers his life, the more resentful he\nis at any change, however minute. And of all the changes which offend\npeople, changes which require them to think are most disliked.\n\nThe high brass in the Power Board considered that everything was moving\nsmoothly. There was no need to consider new devices. Hoddan's drawings\nand plans had simply never been bothered with, because there was no\nrecognized need for them. And when he forced acknowledgment that his\nreceptor worked, the unwelcome demonstration was highly offensive in\nitself. It was natural, it was inevitable, it should have been\ninfallibly certain that any possible excuse for not thinking about the\nreceptor would be seized upon. And a single dead man found near the\noperating demonstrator.... If one assumed that the demonstrator had\nkilled him,--why one could react emotionally, feel vast indignation,\nfrantically command that the device and its inventor be suppressed\ntogether, and go on living happily without doing any thinking or making\nany other change in anything at all.\n\nHoddan was appalled. Now that it had happened, he could see that it had\nto. The world of Walden was at the very peak of human culture. It had\narrived at so splendid a plane of civilization that nobody could imagine\nany improvement--unless a better tranquilizer could be designed to make\nit more endurable. Nobody ever really wants anything he didn't think of\nfor himself. Nobody can want anything he doesn't know exists--or that he\ncan't imagine to exist. On Walden nobody wanted anything, unless it was\nrelief from the tedium of ultra-civilized life. Hoddan's electronic\ndevice did not fill a human need; only a technical one. It had,\ntherefore, no value that would make anybody hospitable to it.\n\nAnd Hoddan would spend his life in jail for failing to recognize the\nfact.\n\nHe revolted, immediately. _He_ wanted something! He wanted out. And\nbecause he was that kind of man he put his mind to work devising\nsomething he wanted, simply and directly, without trying to get it by\nfurnishing other people with what they turned out not to want. He set\nabout designing his escape. With his enforced change in viewpoint, he\ntook the view that he must seem, at least, to give his captors and\njailers and--as he saw it--his persecutors what they wanted.\n\nThey would be pleased to have him dead, provided their consciences were\nclear. He built on that as a foundation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVery shortly before nightfall he performed certain cryptic actions. He\nunraveled threads from his shirt and put them aside. There would be a\nvision-lens in the ceiling of his cell, and somebody would certainly\nnotice what he did. He made a light. He put the threads in his mouth,\nset fire to his mattress, and laid down calmly upon it. The mattress was\nof excellent quality. It would smell very badly as it smoldered.\n\nIt did. Lying flat, he kicked convulsively for a few seconds. He looked\nlike somebody who had taken poison. Then he waited.\n\nIt was a rather long time before his jailer came down the cell corridor,\ndragging a fire hose. Hoddan had been correct in assuming that he was\nwatched. His actions had been those of a man who'd anticipated a\npossible need to commit suicide, and who'd had poison in a part of his\nshirt for convenience. The jailer did not hurry, because if the inventor\nof a deathray committed suicide, everybody would feel better. Hoddan had\nbeen allowed a reasonable time in which to die.\n\nHe seemed impressively dead when the jailer opened his cell door,\ndragged him out, removed the so-far-unscorched other furniture, and set\nup the fire hose to make an aerosol fog which would put out the fire. He\nwent back to the corridor to wait for the fire to be extinguished.\n\nHoddan crowned him with a stool, feeling an unexpected satisfaction in\nthe act. The jailer collapsed.\n\nHe did not carry keys. The system was for him to be let out of this\ncorridor by a guard outside. Hoddan growled and took the fire hose. He\nturned its nozzle back to make a stream instead of a mist. Water came\nout at four hundred pounds pressure. He smashed open the corridor door\nwith it. He strolled through and bowled over a startled guard with the\nsame stream. He took the guard's stun-pistol. He washed open another\ndoor leading to the courtyard. He marched out, washed down two guards\nwho sighted him, and took the trouble to flush them across the pavement\nuntil they wedged in a drain opening. Then he thoughtfully reset the\nhose to fill the courtyard with fog, climbed into the driver's seat of\nthe truck that had brought him here--it was probably the same one--and\nsmashed through the gateway to the street outside. Behind him, the\ncourtyard filled with dense white mist.\n\nHe was free, but only temporarily. Around him lay the capital city of\nWalden--the highest civilization in this part of the galaxy. Trees lined\nits ways. Towers rose splendidly toward the skies, with thousands of\nless ambitious structures in between. There were open squares and\nparkways and malls, and it did not smell like a city at all. But he\nwasn't loose three minutes before the communicator in the truck squawked\nthe all-police alarm for him.\n\nIt was to be expected. All the city would shortly be one enormous\nman-trap, set to catch Bron Hoddan. There was only one place on the\nplanet, in fact, where he could be safe--and he wouldn't be safe there\nif he'd been officially charged with murder. But since the police had\ntactfully failed to mention murder, he could get at least breathing-time\nby taking refuge in the Interstellar Embassy.\n\nHe headed for it, bowling along splendidly. The police truck hummed on\nits way for half a mile; three-quarters. The great open square before\nthe Embassy became visible. The Embassy was not that of a single planet,\nof course. By pure necessity every human-inhabited world was independent\nof all others, but the Interstellar Diplomatic Service represented\nhumanity at large upon each individual globe. Its ambassador was the\nonly person Hoddan could even imagine as listening to him, and that\nbecause he came from off-planet, as Hoddan did. But he mainly counted\nupon a breathing-space in the Embassy, during which to make more plans\nas yet unformed and unformable. He began, though, to see some virtues in\nthe simple, lawless, piratical world in which he had spent his\nchildhood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother police truck rushed frantically toward him down a side street.\nStun-pistols made little pinging noises against the body of his vehicle.\nHe put on more speed, but the other truck overtook him. It ranged\nalongside, its occupants waving stern commands to halt. And then, just\nbefore it swerved to force him off the highway, he swung instead and\ndrove it into a tree. It crashed thunderously. One of his own wheels\ncollapsed. He drove on with the crumpled wheel producing an up-and-down\nmotion that threatened to make him seasick. Then he heard yelling behind\nhim. The cops had piled out of the truck and were in pursuit on foot.\n\nThe tall, rough-stone wall of the Embassy was visible, now, beyond the\nmonument to the First Settlers of Walden. He leaped to the ground and\nran. Stun-pistol bolts, a little beyond their effective range, stung\nlike fire. They spurred him on.\n\nThe gate of the Embassy was closed. He bolted around the corner and\nswarmed up the conveniently rugged stones of the wall. He was well aloft\nbefore the cops spotted him. Then they fired at him industriously and\nthe charges crackled all around him.\n\nBut he'd reached the top and had both arms over the parapet before a\ncharge hit his legs and stunned them--paralyzed them. He hung fast,\nswearing at his bad luck.\n\nThen hands grasped his wrists. A white-haired man appeared on the other\nside of the parapet. He took a good, solid grip, and heaved. He drew\nHoddan over the breast-high top of the wall and let him down to the\nwalkway inside it.\n\n\"A near thing, that!\" said the white-haired man pleasantly. \"I was\ntaking a walk in the garden when I heard the excitement. I got to the\nwall-top just in time.\" He paused, and added, \"I do hope you're not just\na common murderer with the police after him! We can't offer asylum to\nsuch--only a breathing-space and a chance to start running again. But if\nyou're a political offender--\"\n\nHoddan began to try to rub sensation and usefulness back into his legs.\nFeeling came back, and was not pleasant.\n\n\"I'm the Interstellar Ambassador,\" said the white-haired man politely.\n\n\"My name,\" said Hoddan bitterly, \"is Bron Hoddan and I'm framed for\ntrying to save the Power Board some millions of credits a year!\" Then he\nsaid more bitterly: \"If you want to know, I ran away from Zan to try to\nbe a civilized man and live a civilized life. It was a mistake! I'm to\nbe permanently jailed for using my brains!\"\n\nThe ambassador cocked his head thoughtfully to one side.\n\n\"Zan?\" he said. \"The name Hoddan fits to that somehow. Oh, yes!\nSpace-piracy! People say the people of Zan capture and loot a dozen or\nso ships a year, only there's no way to prove it on them. And there's a\nman named Hoddan who's supposed to head a particularly ruffianly gang.\"\n\n\"My grandfather,\" said Hoddan defiantly. \"What are you going to do about\nit? I'm outlawed! I've defied the planetary government! I'm disreputable\nby descent, and worst of all I've tried to use my brains!\"\n\n\"Deplorable!\" said the ambassador mildly. \"I don't mean outlawry is\ndeplorable, you understand, or defiance of the government, or being\ndisreputable. But trying to use one's brains is bad business! A serious\noffense! Are your legs all right now? Then come on down with me and I'll\nhave you given some dinner and some fresh clothing and so on. Offhand,\"\nhe added amiably, \"it would seem that using one's brains would be\nclassed as a political offense rather than a criminal one on Walden.\nWe'll see.\"\n\nHoddan gaped up at him.\n\n\"You mean there's a possibility that--\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said the ambassador in surprise. \"You haven't phrased it\nthat way, but you're actually a rebel. A revolutionist. You defy\nauthority and tradition and governments and such things. Naturally the\nInterstellar Diplomatic Service is inclined to be on your side. What do\nyou think it's for?\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIn something under two hours Hoddan was ushered into the ambassador's\noffice. He'd been refreshed, his torn clothing replaced by more\nrespectable garments, and the places where stun-pistols had stung him\nsoothed by ointments. But, more important, he'd worked out and firmly\nadopted a new point of view.\n\nHe'd been a misfit at home on Zan because he was not contented with the\nhumdrum and monotonous life of a member of a space-pirate community.\nPiracy was a matter of dangerous take-offs in cranky rocket-ships, to be\nfollowed by weeks or months of tedious and uncomfortable boredom in\nhighly unhealthy re-breathed air. No voyage ever contained more than ten\nseconds of satisfactory action--and all space-fighting took place just\nout of the atmosphere of a possibly embattled planet, because you\ncouldn't intercept a ship at cruising speed between the stars.\nRegardless of the result of the fighting, one had to get away fast when\nit was over, lest overwhelming force swarm up from the nearby world. It\nwas intolerably devoid of anything an ambitious young man would want.\n\nEven when one had made a good prize--with the lifeboats darting\nfrantically for ground--and after one got back to Zan with a captured\nship, even then there was little satisfaction in a piratical career. Zan\nhad not a large population. Piracy couldn't support a large number of\npeople. Zan couldn't attempt to defend itself against even single\nheavily-armed ships that sometimes came in passionate resolve to avenge\nthe disappearance of a rich freighter or a fast new liner. So the people\nof Zan, to avoid hanging, had to play innocent. They had to be\nconvincingly simple, harmless folk who cultivated their fields and led\nquiet, blameless lives. They might loot, but they had to hide their\nbooty where investigators would not find it. They couldn't really\nbenefit by it. They had to build their own houses and make their own\ngarments and grow their own food. So life on Zan was dull. Piracy was\nnot profitable in the sense that one could live well by it. It simply\nwasn't a trade for a man like Hoddan.\n\nSo he'd abandoned it. He'd studied electronics in books from looted\npassenger-ship libraries. Within months after arrival on a law-abiding\nplanet, he was able to earn a living in electronics as an honest trade.\n\nAnd that was unsatisfactory. Law-abiding communities were no more\nthrilling or rewarding than piratical ones. A payday now and then didn't\nmake up for the tedium of labor. Even when one had money there wasn't\nmuch to do with it. On Walden, to be sure, the level of civilization was\nso high that many people needed psychiatric treatment to stand it, and\nneurotics vastly outnumbered more normal folk. And on Walden electronics\nwas only a trade like piracy, and no more fun.\n\nHe should have known it would be this way. His grandfather had often\ndiscussed this frustration in human life.\n\n\"Us humans,\" it was his grandfather's habit to say, \"don't make sense!\nThere's some of us that work so hard they're too tired to enjoy life.\nThere's some that work so hard at enjoying it that they don't get no fun\nout of it. And the rest of us spend our lives complainin' that there\nain't any fun in it anyhow. The man that over all has the best time of\nany is one that picks out something he hasn't got a chance to do, and\nspends his life raisin' hell because he's stopped from doing it.\nWhen\"--and here Hoddan's grandfather tended to be emphatic--\"he\nwouldn't think much of it if he could!\"\n\nWhat Hoddan craved, of course, was a sense of achievement, of doing\nthings worth doing, and doing them well. Technically there were\nopportunities all around him. He'd developed one, and it would save\nmillions of credits a year if it were adopted. But nobody wanted it.\nHe'd tried to force its use, he was in trouble, and now he could\ncomplain justly enough, but despite his grandfather he was not the\nhappiest man he knew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ambassador received him with a cordial wave of the hand.\n\n\"Things move fast,\" he said cheerfully. \"You weren't here half an hour\nbefore there was a police captain at the gate. He explained that an\nexcessively dangerous criminal had escaped jail and been seen to climb\nthe Embassy wall. He offered very generously to bring some men in and\ncapture you and take you away--with my permission, of course. He was\nshocked when I declined.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"By the way,\" said the ambassador. \"Young men like yourself-- Is there a\ngirl involved in this?\"\n\nHoddan considered.\n\n\"A girl's father,\" he acknowledged, \"is the real complainant against\nme.\"\n\n\"Does he complain,\" asked the ambassador, \"because you want to marry\nher, or because you don't?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" Hoddan told him. \"She hasn't quite decided that I'm worth\ndefying her rich father for.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the ambassador. \"It can't be too bad a mess while a woman\nis being really practical. I've checked your story. Allowing for\ndifferences of viewpoint, it agrees with the official version. I've\nruled that you are a political refugee, and so entitled to sanctuary in\nthe Embassy. And that's that.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"There's no question about the crime,\" observed the ambassador, \"or that\nit is primarily political. You proposed to improve a technical process\nin a society which considers itself beyond improvement. If you'd\nsucceeded, the idea of change would have spread, people now poor would\nhave gotten rich, people now rich would have gotten poor, and you'd have\ndone what all governments are established to prevent. So you'll never be\nable to walk the streets of this planet again in safety. You've scared\npeople.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hoddan. \"It's been an unpleasant surprise to them, to\nbe scared.\"\n\nThe ambassador put the tips of his fingers together.\n\n\"Do you realize,\" he asked, \"that the whole purpose of civilization is\nto take the surprises out of life, so one can be bored to death? That a\nculture in which nothing unexpected ever happens is in what is called\nits Golden Age? That when nobody can even imagine anything happening\nunexpectedly, that they later fondly refer to that period as the Good\nOld Days?\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of it in just those words, sir--\"\n\n\"It is one of the most-avoided facts of life,\" said the ambassador.\n\"Government, in the local or planetary sense of the word, is an\norganization for the suppression of adventure. Taxes are, in part, the\ninsurance premiums one pays for protection against the unpredictable.\nAnd you have offended against everything that is the foundation of a\nstable and orderly and damnably tedious way of life--against\ncivilization, in fact.\"\n\nHoddan frowned.\n\n\"Yet you've granted me asylum--\"\n\n\"Naturally!\" said the ambassador. \"The Diplomatic Service works for the\nwelfare of humanity. That doesn't mean stuffiness. A Golden Age in any\ncivilization is always followed by collapse. In ancient days savages\ncame and camped outside the walls of super-civilized towns. They were\nunwashed, unmannerly, and unsanitary. Super-civilized people refused\neven to think about them! So presently the savages stormed the city\nwalls and another civilization went up in flames.\"\n\n\"But now,\" objected Hoddan, \"there are no savages.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They invent themselves,\" the ambassador told him. \"My point is that the\nDiplomatic Service cherishes individuals and causes which battle\nstuffiness and complacency and Golden Ages and monstrous things like\nthat. Not thieves, of course. They're degradation, like body lice. But\nrebels and crackpots and revolutionaries who prevent hardening of the\narteries of commerce and furnish wholesome exercise to the body\npolitic--they're worth cherishing!\"\n\n\"I ... think I see, sir,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"I hope you do,\" said the ambassador. \"My action on your behalf is pure\ndiplomatic policy. To encourage the dissatisfied is to insure against\nuniversal satisfaction--which is lethal. Walden is in a bad way. You are\nthe most encouraging thing that has happened here in a long time. And\nyou're not a native.\"\n\n\"No-o-o,\" agreed Hoddan. \"I come from Zan.\"\n\n\"Never mind.\" The ambassador turned to a stellar atlas. \"Consider\nyourself a good symptom, and valued as such. If you could start a\ncontagion, you'd deserve well of your fellow citizens. Savages can\nalways invent themselves. But enough of apology from me. Let us set\nabout your affairs.\" He consulted the atlas. \"Where would you like to\ngo, since you must leave Walden?\"\n\n\"Not too far, sir--\"\n\n\"The girl, eh?\" The ambassador did not smile. He ran his finger down a\npage. \"The nearest inhabited worlds, of course, are Krim and Darth. Krim\nis a place of lively commercial activity, where an electronics engineer\nshould easily find employment. It is said to be progressive and there is\nmuch organized research--\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be a kept engineer, sir,\" said Hoddan\napologetically. \"I'd rather ... well ... putter on my own.\"\n\n\"Impractical, but sensible,\" commented the ambassador. He turned a page.\n\"There's Darth. Its social system is practically feudal. It's\ntechnically backward. There's a landing grid, but space exports are\nskins and metal ingots and practically nothing else. There is no\nbroadcast power. Strangers find the local customs difficult. There is no\ntown larger than twenty thousand people, and few approach that size.\nMost settled places are mere villages near some feudal castle, and roads\nare so few and bad that wheeled transport is rare.\"\n\nHe leaned back and said in a detached voice:\n\n\"I had a letter from there a couple of months ago. It was rather\narrogant. The writer was one Don Loris, and he explained that his\ndignity would not let him make a commercial offer, but an electronic\nengineer who put himself under his protection would not be the loser. He\nsigned himself prince of this, lord of that, baron of the other thing\nand claimant to the dukedom of something else. Are you interested? No\nkings on Darth, just feudal chiefs.\"\n\nHoddan thought it over.\n\n\"I'll go to Darth,\" he decided. \"It's bound to be better than Zan, and\nit can't be worse than Walden.\"\n\nThe ambassador looked impassive. An Embassy servant came in and offered\nan indoor communicator. The ambassador put it to his ear. After a moment\nhe said:\n\n\"Show him in.\" He turned to Hoddan. \"You did kick up a storm! The\nMinister of State, no less, is here to demand your surrender. I'll\ncounter with a formal request for an exit-permit. I'll talk to you again\nwhen he leaves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan went out. He paced up and down the other room into which he was\nshown. Darth wouldn't be in a Golden Age! He was wiser now than he'd\nbeen this same morning. He recognized that he'd made mistakes. Now he\ncould see rather ruefully how completely improbable it was that anybody\ncould put across a technical device merely by proving its value, without\nmaking anybody want it. He shook his head regretfully at the blunder.\n\nThe ambassador sent for him.\n\n\"I've had a pleasant time,\" he told Hoddan genially. \"There was a\nbeautiful row. You've really scared people, Hoddan! You deserve well of\nthe republic! Every government and every person needs to be thoroughly\nterrified occasionally. It limbers up the brain.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hoddan. \"I've--\"\n\n\"The planetary government,\" said the ambassador with relish, \"insists\nthat you have to be locked up with the key thrown away. Because you know\nhow to make deathrays. I said it was nonsense, and you were a political\nrefugee in sanctuary. The Minister of State said the Cabinet would\nconsider removing you forcibly from the Embassy if you weren't\nsurrendered. I said that if the Embassy was violated no ship would clear\nfor Walden from any other civilized planet. They wouldn't like losing\ntheir off-planet trade! Then he said that the government would not give\nyou an exit-permit, and that he would hold me personally responsible if\nyou killed everybody on Walden, including himself and me. I said he\ninsulted me by suggesting that I'd permit such shenanigans. He said the\ngovernment would take an extremely grave view of my attitude, and I said\nthey would be silly if they did. Then he went off with great\ndignity--but shaking with panic--to think up more nonsense.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Evidently,\" said Hoddan in relief, \"you believe me when I say that my\ngadget doesn't make deathrays.\"\n\nThe ambassador looked slightly embarrassed.\n\n\"To be honest,\" he admitted, \"I've no doubt that you invented it\nindependently, but they've been using such a device for half a century\nin the Cetis cluster. They've had no trouble.\"\n\nHoddan winced.\n\n\"Did you tell the Minister that?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said the ambassador. \"It would have done you no good. You're\nin open revolt and have performed overt acts of violence against the\npolice. But also it was impolite enough for me to suggest that the local\ngovernment was stupid. It would have been most undiplomatic to prove\nit.\"\n\nHoddan did not feel very proud, just then.\n\n\"I'm thinking that the cops--quite unofficially--might try to kidnap me\nfrom the Embassy. They'll deny that they tried, especially if they\nmanage it. But I think they'll try.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said the ambassador. \"We'll take precautions.\"\n\n\"I'd like to make something--not lethal--just in case,\" said Hoddan. \"If\nyou can trust me not to make deathrays, I'd like to make a generator of\nodd-shaped microwaves. They're described in textbooks. They ionize the\nair where they strike. That's all. They make air a high-resistance\nconductor. Nothing more than that.\"\n\nThe ambassador said:\n\n\"There was an old-fashioned way to make ozone....\" When Hoddan nodded, a\nlittle surprised, the ambassador said: \"By all means go ahead. You\nshould be able to get parts from your room vision-receiver. I'll have\nsome tools given you.\" Then he added: \"Diplomacy has to understand the\nthings that control events. Once it was social position. For a time it\nwas weapons. Then it was commerce. Now it's technology. But I wonder how\nyou'll use the ionization of air to protect yourself from kidnapers!\nDon't tell me! I'd rather try to guess.\"\n\nHe waved his hand in cordial dismissal and an Embassy servant showed\nHoddan to his quarters. Ten minutes later another staff man brought him\ntools such as would be needed for work on a vision set. He was left\nalone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe delicately disassembled the set in his room and began to put some of\nthe parts together in a novel but wholly rational fashion. The science\nof electronics, like the science of mathematics, had progressed away\nbeyond the point where all of it had practical applications. One could\nspend a lifetime learning things that research had discovered in the\npast, and industry had never found a use for. On Zan, industriously\nreading pirated books, Hoddan hadn't known where utility stopped. He'd\nkept on learning long after a practical man would have stopped studying\nto get a paying job.\n\nAny electronic engineer could have made the device he now assembled. It\nonly needed to be wanted--and apparently he was the first person to want\nit. In this respect it was like the receptor that had gotten him into\ntrouble. But as he put the small parts together, he felt a certain\nloneliness. A man Hoddan's age needs to have some girl admire him from\ntime to time. If Nedda had been sitting cross-legged before him,\nlistening raptly while he explained, Hoddan would probably have been\nperfectly happy. But she wasn't. It wasn't likely she ever would be.\nHoddan scowled.\n\nInside of an hour he'd made a hand-sized, five-watt, wave-guide\nprojector of waves of eccentric form. In the beam of that projector, air\nbecame ionized. Air became a high-resistance conductor comparable to\nnichrome wire, when and where the projector sent its microwaves.\n\nHe was wrapping tape about the pistol grip when a servant brought him a\nscribbled note. It had been handed in at the Embassy gate by a woman who\nfled after leaving it. It looked like Nedda's handwriting. It read like\nNedda's phrasing. It appeared to have been written by somebody in a\nhighly emotional state. But it wasn't quite--not absolutely--convincing.\n\nHe went to find the ambassador. He handed over the note. The ambassador\nread it and raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It could be authentic,\" admitted Hoddan.\n\n\"In other words,\" said the ambassador, \"you are not sure that it is a\nbooby trap--an invitation to a date with the police?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" said Hoddan. \"I think I'd better bite. If I have any\nillusions left after this morning, I'd better find it out. I thought\nNedda liked me quite a lot.\"\n\n\"I make no comment,\" observed the ambassador. \"Can I help you in any\nway?\"\n\n\"I have to leave the Embassy,\" said Hoddan, \"and there's a practically\nsolid line of police outside the walls. Could I borrow some old clothes,\na few pillows, and a length of rope?\"\n\nHalf an hour later a rope uncoiled itself at the very darkest outside\ncorner of the Embassy wall. It dangled down to the ground. This was at\nthe rear of the Embassy enclosure. The night was bright with stars, and\nthe city's towers glittered with many lights. But here there was almost\ncomplete blackness and that silence of a city which is sometimes so\ncompanionable.\n\nThe rope remained hanging from the wall. No light reached the ground\nthere. The tiny crescent of Walden's farthest moon cast an insufficient\nglow. Nothing could be seen by it.\n\nThe rope went up, as if it had been lowered merely to make sure that it\nwas long enough for its purpose. Then it descended again. This time a\nfigure dangled at its end. It came down, swaying a little. It reached\nthe blackest part of the shadow at the wall's base. It stayed there.\n\nNothing happened. The figure rose swiftly, hauled up in rapid pullings\nof the rope. Then the line came down again and again a figure descended.\nBut this figure moved. The rope swayed and oscillated. The figure came\ndown a good halfway to the ground. It paused, and then descended with\nmuch movement to two-thirds of the way from the top.\n\nThere something seemed to alarm it. It began to rise with violent\nwrithings of the rope. It climbed--\n\nThere was a crackling noise. A stun-pistol. The figure seemed to climb\nmore frantically. More cracklings. Half a dozen--a dozen sharp, snapping\nnoises. They were stun-pistol charges and there were tiny sparks where\nthey hit. The dangling figure seemed convulsed. It went limp, but it did\nnot fall. More charges poured into it. It hung motionless halfway up the\nwall of the Embassy.\n\nMovements began in the darkness. Men appeared, talking in low tones and\nstraining their eyes toward the now motionless figure. They gathered\nunderneath it. One went off at a run, carrying a message. Someone of\nauthority arrived, panting. There was more low-toned argument. More and\nstill more men appeared. There were forty or fifty figures at the base\nof the wall.\n\nOne of those figures began to climb the rope hand over hand. He reached\nthe motionless object. He swore in a shocked voice. He was shushed from\nbelow. He let the figure drop. It made next to no sound when it landed.\n\nThen there was a rushing, as the guards about the Embassy went furiously\nback to their proper posts to keep anybody from slipping out Two men\nremained swearing bitterly over a dummy made of old clothes and pillows.\nBut their profanity was in vain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan was then some blocks away. He suffered painful doubt about the\nnote ostensibly from Nedda. The guards about the Embassy would have\ntried to catch him in any case, but it did seem very plausible that the\nnote had been sent him to get him to try to get down the wall. On the\nother hand, a false descent of a palpably dummylike dummy had been\nplausible, too. He'd drawn all the guards to one spot by his seeming\ndoubt and by testing out their vigilance with a dummy. The only thing\nimprobable in his behavior had been that after testing their vigilance\nwith a dummy, he'd made use of it.\n\nA fair distance away, he turned sedately into a narrow lane between\nbuildings. This paralleled another lane serving the home of a girl\nfriend of Nedda's. The note had named the garden behind that other\ngirl's home as a rendezvous. But Hoddan was not going to that garden. He\nwanted to make sure. If the cops had forged the note--\n\nHe judged his position carefully. If he climbed this tree,--hm-m-m....\nKind of the city-planners of Walden to use trees so lavishly--if he\nclimbed this tree he could look into the garden where Nedda in theory\nwaited in tears. He climbed it. He sat astride a thick limb in scented\ndarkness and considered further. Presently he brought out his five-watt\nprojector. There was deepest darkness hereabouts. Trees and shrubbery\nwere merely blacker than their surroundings. But there was reason for\nsuspicion.\n\nNeither in the house of Nedda's girl friend, nor in the nearer house\nbetween, was there a single lighted window.\n\nHoddan adjusted the wave-guide and pressed the stud of his instrument.\nHe pointed it carefully into the nearer garden.\n\nA man grunted in a surprised tone. There was a stirring. A man swore\nstartledly. The words seemed inappropriate to a citizen merely breathing\nthe evening air.\n\nHoddan frowned. The note from Nedda seemed to have been a forgery. To\nmake sure, he readjusted the wave-guide to project a thin but fan-shaped\nbeam. He aimed again. Painstakingly, he traversed the area in which men\nwould have been posted to jump him, in the event that the note was\nforged. If Nedda were there, she would feel no effect. If police lay in\nwait, they would notice. At once.\n\nThey did. A man howled. Two men yelled together. Somebody bellowed.\nSomebody squealed. Someone, in charge of the flares made ready to give\nlight for the police, was so startled by a strange sensation that he\njerked the cord. An immense, cold-white brilliance appeared. The garden\nwhere Nedda definitely was not present became bathed in incandescence.\nLight spilled over the wall of one garden into the next and disclosed a\nsquirming mass of police in the nearer garden also. Some of them leaped\nwildly and ungracefully while clawing behind them. Some stood still and\nstruggled desperately to accomplish something to their rear, while\nothers gazed blankly at them until Hoddan swung his instrument their\nway, also.\n\nA man tore off his pants and swarmed over the wall to get away from\nsomething intolerable. Others imitated him, save in the direction of\ntheir flight. Some removed their trousers before they fled, but others\ntried to get them off while fleeing. Those last did not fare too well.\nMostly they stumbled and other men fell over them, when both fallen and\nfallen-upon uttered hoarse and profane lamentations--they howled to the\nhigh heavens.\n\nHoddan let the confusion mount past any unscrambling, and then slid down\nthe tree and joined in the rush. With the glare in the air behind him,\nhe only feigned to stumble over one figure after another. Once he\ngrunted as he scorched his own fingers. But he came out of the lane with\na dozen stun-pistols, mostly uncomfortably warm, as trophies of the\nambush.\n\nAs they cooled off he stowed them away in his belt and pockets,\nstrolling away down the tree-lined street. Behind him, cops realized\ntheir trouserless condition and appealed plaintively to householders to\nnotify headquarters of their state.\n\nHoddan did not feel particularly disillusioned, somehow. It occurred to\nhim, even, that this particular event was likely to help him get off of\nWalden. If he was to leave against the cops' will, he needed to have\nthem at less than top efficiency. And men who have had their pants\nscorched off them are not apt to think too clearly. Hoddan felt a\ncertain confidence increase in his mind. He'd worked the thing out very\nnicely. If ionization made air a high-resistance conductor, then an\nionizing beam would make a high-resistance short between the power\nterminals of a stun-pistol. With the power a stun-pistol carried, that\nshort would get hot. So would the pistol. It would get hot enough, in\nfact, to scorch cloth in contact with it. Which had happened.\n\nIf the effect had been produced in the soles of policemen's feet, Hoddan\nwould have given every cop a hotfoot. But since they carried their\nstun-pistols in their hip-pockets--\n\nThe thought of Nedda diminished his satisfaction. The note could be pure\nforgery, or the police could have learned about it through the treachery\nof the servant she sent to the Embassy with it. It would be worthwhile\nto know. He headed toward the home of her father. If she were loyal to\nhim--why it would complicate things considerably. But he felt it\nnecessary to find out.\n\nHe neared the spot where Nedda lived. This was an especially desirable\nresidential area. The houses were large and gracefully designed, and the\ngardens were especially lush. Presently he heard music ahead--live\nmusic. He went on. He came to a place where strolling citizens had\npaused under the trees of the street to listen to the melody and the\nsound of voices that accompanied it. And the music and the festivity was\nin the house in which Nedda dwelt. She was having a party, on the very\nnight of the day in which he'd been framed for life imprisonment.\n\nIt was a shock. Then there was a rush of vehicles, and police trucks\nwere disgorging cops before the door. They formed a cordon about the\nhouse, and some knocked and were admitted in haste. Then Hoddan nodded\ndourly to himself.\n\nHis escape from the Embassy was now known. No less certainly, the\nfailure of the trap Nedda's note had baited had been reported. The\npolice were now turning the whole city into a trap for one Bron Hoddan,\nand they were looking first at the most probable places, then they'd\nsearch the possible places for him to be, and by the time that had been\naccomplished they'd have cops from other cities pouring into the city\nand they'd search every square inch of it for him. And certainly and\npositively they'd take the most urgent and infallible precautions to\nmake sure he didn't get back into the Embassy.\n\nIt was a situation that would have appalled Hoddan only that morning.\nNow, though, he only shook his head sadly. He moved on. He'd gotten into\ntrouble by trying to make an industrial civilization accept something it\ndidn't want--a technical improvement in a standard electronic device.\nHe'd gotten partly out of trouble by giving his jailers what they\ndefinitely desired--the sight of him apparently a suicide in the cell in\nthe Detention Building. He'd come out of the Embassy, again, by giving\nthe watchers outside a view they urgently desired--a figure secretly\ndescending the Embassy wall. He'd indulged himself at the ambuscade, but\nthe way to get back into the Embassy....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not far from Nedda's house to a public-safety kiosk, decoratively\nplaced on a street corner. He entered it. It was unattended, of course.\nIt was simply an out-of-door installation where cops could be summoned\nor fires reported or emergencies described by citizens independently of\nthe regular home communicators. It had occurred to Hoddan that the\nplanetary authorities would be greatly pleased to hear of a situation,\nin a place, that would seem to hint at his presence. There were all\nsorts of public services that would be delighted to operate impressively\nin their own lines. There were bureaus which would rejoice in a chance\nto show off their efficiency.\n\nHe used his microwave generator--which at short enough range would\nshort-circuit anything--upon the apparatus in the kiosk. It was\nperfectly simple, if one knew how. He worked with a sort of tender\nthoroughness, shorting this item, shorting that, giving this frantic\nemergency call, stating that baseless lie. When he went out of the kiosk\nhe walked briskly toward an appointment he had made.\n\nAnd presently the murmur of the city at night had new sounds added to\nit. They began as a faint, confused clamor at the edges of the city. The\nuproar moved centralward and grew louder as it came. There were clanging\nbells and sirens and beeper-horns warning all nonofficial vehicles to\nkeep out of the way. On the raised-up expressway snorting metal monsters\nrushed with squealing excitement. On the fragrant lesser streets, small\nvehicles rushed with proportionately louder howlings. Police trucks\npoured out of their cubbyholes and plunged valiantly through the dark.\nBroadcast-units signaled emergency and cut off the air to make the\nplacid ether waves available to authority.\n\nAll these noises and all this tumult moved toward a single point. The\nouter parts of the city regained their former quiet, save that there was\nless music. The broadcasts were off. But the sound of racing vehicles\nclamoring for right-of-way grew louder and louder, and more and more\nperemptory as it concentrated toward the large open square on which the\nInterstellar Embassy faced. From every street and avenue fire-fighting\nequipment poured into that square. In between and behind, hooting loudly\nfor precedence, police trucks accompanied and fore-ran them. Emergency\nvehicles of all the civic bureaus appeared, all of them with immense\nconviction of their importance.\n\nIt was a very large open square, that space before the Embassy. From its\nedge, the monument to the First Settlers in the center looked small. But\neven that vast plaza filled up with trucks of every imaginable variety,\nfrom the hose towers which could throw streams of water four hundred\nfeet straight up, to the miniature trouble-wagons of Electricity Supply.\nStaff cars of fire and police and sanitary services crowded each other\nand bumped fenders with tree-surgeon trucks prepared to move fallen\ntrees, and with public-address trucks ready to lend stentorian tones to\nany voice of authority.\n\nBut there was no situation except that there was no situation. There was\nno fire. There was no riot. There were not even stray dogs for the pound\nwagons to pursue, nor broken water mains for the water department\ntechnicians to shut off and repair. There was nothing for anybody to do\nbut ask everybody else what the hell they were doing there, and\npresently to swear at each other for cluttering up the way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe din of arriving horns and sirens had stopped, and a mutter of\nprofanity was developing, when a last vehicle arrived. It was an\nambulance, and it came purposefully out of a side avenue and swung\ntoward a particular place as if it knew exactly what it was about. When\nits way was blocked, it hooted impatiently for passage. Its lights\nblinked violently red, demanding clearance. A giant fire-fighting unit\npulled aside. The ambulance ran past and hooted at a cluster of police\ntrucks. They made way for it. It blared at a gathering of dismounted,\nirritated truck personnel. It made its way through them. It moved in a\nstraight line for the gate of the Interstellar Embassy.\n\nA hundred yards from that gate, its horn blatted irritably at the car of\nthe acting head of municipal police. That car obediently made way for\nit.\n\nThe ambulance rolled briskly up to the very gate of the Embassy. There\nit stopped. A figure got down from the driver's seat and walked\npurposefully in the gate.\n\nThereafter nothing happened at all until a second figure rolled and\ntoppled itself out on the ground from the seat beside the ambulance\ndriver's. That figure kicked and writhed on the ground. A policeman went\nto find out what was the matter.\n\nIt was the ambulance driver. Not the one who'd driven the ambulance to\nthe Embassy gate, but the one who should have. He was bound hand and\nfoot and not too tightly gagged. When released he swore vividly while\npanting that he had been captured and bound by somebody who said he was\nBron Hoddan and was in a hurry to get back to the Interstellar Embassy.\n\nThere was no uproar. Those to whom Hoddan's name had meaning were struck\nspeechless with rage. The fury of the police was even too deep for\ntears.\n\nBut Bron Hoddan, back in the quarters assigned him in the Embassy,\nunloaded a dozen cooled-off stun-pistols from his pockets and sent word\nto the ambassador that he was back, and that the note ostensibly from\nNedda had actually been a police trap.\n\nGetting ready to retire, he reviewed his situation. In some respects it\nwas not too bad. All but Nedda's share in trying to trap him, and having\na party the same night.... He stared morosely at the wall. Then he saw,\nvery simply, that she mightn't have known even of his arrest. She lived\na highly sheltered life. Her father could have had her kept completely\nin ignorance....\n\nHe cheered immediately. This would be his last night on Walden, if he\nwere lucky, but vague plans already revolved in his mind. Yes.... He'd\nachieve splendid things, he'd grow rich, he'd come back and marry that\ndelightful girl, Nedda, and end as a great man. Already, today, he'd\ndone a number of things worth doing, and on the whole he'd done them\nwell.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nWhen dawn broke over the capital city of Walden, the sight was\nappropriately glamorous. There were shining towers and curving\ntree-bordered ways, above which innumerable small birds flew\ntumultuously. The dawn, in fact, was heralded by high-pitched chirpings\neverywhere. During the darkness there had been a deep-toned humming\nsound, audible all over the city. That was the landing grid in operation\nout at the spaceport, letting down a twenty-thousand-ton liner from\nRigel, Cetis, and the Nearer Rim. Presently it would take off for Krim,\nDarth, and the Coalsack Stars, and if Hoddan was lucky he would be on\nit. But at the earliest part of the day there was only tranquillity over\nthe city and the square and the Interstellar Embassy.\n\nAt the gate of the Embassy enclosure, staff members piled up boxes and\nbales and parcels for transport to the spaceport and thence to\ndestinations whose names were practically songs. There were dispatches\nto Delil, where the Interstellar Diplomatic Service had a sector\nheadquarters, and there were packets of embassy-stamped invoices for\nLohala and Tralee and Famagusta. There were boxes for Sind and Maja, and\nmetal-bound cases for Kent. The early explorers of this part of the\ngalaxy had christened huge suns for little villages and territories back\non Earth--which less than one human being in ten thousand had ever seen.\n\nThe sound of the stacking of freight parcels was crisp and distinct in\nthe morning hush. The dew deposited during darkness had not yet dried\nfrom the pavement of the square. Damp, unhappy figures loafed nearby.\nThey were self-evidently secret police, as yet unrelieved after a\nnight's vigil about the Embassy's rugged wall. They were sleepy and\ntheir clothing stuck soggily to them, and none of them had had anything\nwarm in his stomach for many hours. They had not, either, anything to\nlook forward to from their superiors.\n\nHoddan was again in sanctuary inside the Embassy they'd guarded so\nineptly through the dark. He'd gotten out without their leave, and made\na number of their fellows unwilling to sit down and then made all the\npolice and municipal authorities ridiculous by the manner of his return.\nThe police guards about the Embassy were very positively not in a cheery\nmood. But one of them saw an Embassy servant he knew. He'd stood the man\ndrinks, in times past, to establish a contact that might be useful. He\nsummoned a smile and beckoned to that man.\n\nThe Embassy servant came briskly to him, rubbing his hands after having\nput a moderately heavy case of documents on top of the waiting pile.\n\n\"That Hoddan,\" said the plainclothesman, attempting hearty ruefulness,\n\"he certainly put it over on us last night!\"\n\nThe servant nodded.\n\n\"Look,\" said the plainclothesman, \"there could be something in it for\nyou if you ... hm-m-m ... wanted to make a little extra money.\"\n\nThe servant looked regretful.\n\n\"No chance,\" he said, \"he's leaving today.\"\n\nThe plainclothesman jumped.\n\n\"Today?\"\n\n\"For Darth,\" said the Embassy servant. \"The ambassador's shipping him\noff on the space liner that came in last night.\"\n\nThe plainclothesman dithered.\n\n\"How's he going to get to the spaceport?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" said the servant. \"They've figured out some way. I\ncould use a little extra money, too.\"\n\nHe lingered, but the plainclothesman was staring at the innocent,\ninviolable parcels about to leave the Embassy for distant parts. He took\nnote of sizes and descriptions. No. Not yet. But if Hoddan was leaving\nhe had to leave the Embassy. If he left the Embassy....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plainclothesman bolted. He made a breathless report by the portable\ncommunicator set up for just such use. He told what the Embassy servant\nhad said, and the inference to be drawn from it, the suspicions to be\nentertained--and there he stopped short. Orders came back to him. Orders\nwere given in all directions. Somebody was going to distinguish himself\nby catching Hoddan, and undercover politics worked to decide who it\nshould be. Even the job of guard outside the Embassy became desirable.\nSo fresh, alert plainclothesmen arrived. They were bright-eyed and\nbushy-tailed, and they took over. Weary, hungry men yielded up their\nposts. They went home. The man who'd gotten the infallibly certain clue\nwent home too, disgruntled because he wasn't allowed a share in the\ncredit for Hoddan's capture. But he was glad of it later.\n\nInside the Embassy, Hoddan finished his breakfast with the ambassador.\n\n\"I'm giving you,\" said the ambassador, \"that letter to the character on\nDarth. I told you about him. He's some sort of nobleman and has need of\nan electronic engineer. On Darth they're rare to nonexistent. But his\nletter wasn't too specific.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" agreed Hoddan. \"I'll look him up. Thanks.\"\n\n\"Somehow,\" said the ambassador, \"I cherish unreasonable hopes of you,\nHoddan. A psychologist would say that your group identification is low\nand your cyclothymia practically a minus quantity, while your ergic\ntension is pleasingly high. He'd mean that with reasonable good fortune\nyou will raise more hell than most. I wish you that good fortune. And\nHoddan--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I don't urge you to be vengeful,\" explained the ambassador, \"but I do\nhope you won't be too forgiving of these characters who'd have jailed\nyou for life. You've scared them badly. It's very good for them.\nAnything more you can do in that line will be really a kindness, and as\nsuch will positively not be appreciated, but it'll be well worth\ndoing.... I say this because I like the way you plan things. And any\ntime I can be of service--\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Hoddan, \"but I'd better get going for the spaceport.\"\nHe'd write Nedda from Darth. \"I'll get set for it.\"\n\nHe rose. The ambassador stood up too.\n\n\"I like the way you plan things,\" he repeated appreciatively. \"We'll\ncheck over that box.\"\n\nThey left the Embassy dining room together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was well after sunrise when Hoddan finished his breakfast, and the\nbright and watchful new plainclothesmen were very much on the alert\noutside. By this time the sunshine had lost its early ruddy tint, and\nthe trees about the city were vividly green, and the sky had become\nappropriately blue--as the skies on all human-occupied planets are.\nThere was the beginning of traffic. Some was routine movement of goods\nand vehicles. But some was special.\n\nFor example, the trucks which came to carry the Embassy shipment to the\nspaceport. They were perfectly ordinary trucks, hired in a perfectly\nordinary way by the ambassador's secretary. They came trundling across\nthe square and into the Embassy gate. The ostentatiously loafing\nplainclothesmen could look in and see the waiting parcels loaded on\nthem. The first truckload was quite unsuspicious. There was no package\nin the lot which could have held a man in even the most impossibly\ncramped of positions.\n\nBut the police took no chances. Ten blocks from the Embassy the cops\nstopped it and verified the licenses and identities of the driver and\nhis helper. This was a moderately lengthy business. While it went on,\nplainclothesmen worked over the packages in the truck's body and put\nstethoscopes to any of more than one cubic foot capacity.\n\nThey waved the truck on. Meanwhile the second truck was loading up. And\nthe watching, ostensible loafers saw that nearly the last item to be put\non it was a large box which hadn't been visible before. It was carried\nwith some care, and it was marked fragile, and it was put into place and\nwedged fast with other parcels.\n\nThe plainclothesmen looked at each other with anticipatory glee. One of\nthem reported the last large box with almost lyric enthusiasm. When the\nsecond truck left the Embassy with the large box, a police truck came\ninnocently out of nowhere and just happened to be going the same way.\nTen blocks away, again the truck load of Embassy parcels was flagged\ndown and its driver's license and identity was verified. A\nplainclothesman put a stethoscope on the questionable case. He beamed,\nand made a suitable signal.\n\nThe truck went on, while zestful, Machiavelian plans took effect.\n\nFive blocks farther, an unmarked empty truck came hurtling out of a side\nstreet, sideswiped the truck from the Embassy, and went careening away\ndown the street without stopping. The trailing police truck made no\nattempt at pursuit. Instead, it stopped helpfully by the truck which had\nbeen hit. A wheel was hopelessly gone. So uniformed police, with\nconspicuously happy expressions, cleared a space around the stalled\ntruck and stood guard over the parcels under diplomatic seal. With eager\nhelpfulness, they sent for other transportation for the Embassy's\nshipment.\n\nA sneeze was heard from within the mass of guarded freight, and the\npolicemen shook hands with each other. When substitute trucks\ncame--there were two of them--they loaded one high with Embassy parcels\nand sent it off to the spaceport with their blessing. There remained\njust one, single, large-sized box to be put on the second vehicle. They\nbumped it on the ground, and a startled grunt came from within.\n\nThere was an atmosphere of innocent enjoyment all about as the police\ntenderly loaded this large box on the second truck they'd sent for, and\nfestooned themselves about it as it trundled away. Strangely, it did not\nhead directly for the spaceport. The police carefully explained this to\neach other in loud voices. Then some of them were afraid the box hadn't\nheard, so they knocked on it. The box coughed, and it seemed hilariously\namusing to the policemen that the contents of a freight parcel should\ncough. They expressed deep concern and--addressing the box--explained\nthat they were taking it to the Detention Building, where they would\ngive it some cough medicine.\n\nThe box swore at them, despairingly. They howled with childish laughter,\nand assured the box that after they had opened it and given it cough\nmedicine they would close it again very carefully--leaving the\ndiplomatic seal unbroken--and deliver it to the spaceport so it could go\non its way.\n\nThe box swore again, luridly. The truck which carried it hastened. The\nbox teetered and bumped and jounced with the swift motion of the vehicle\nthat carried it and all the police around it. Bitter, enraged, and\nhighly unprintable language came from within.\n\nThe police were charmed. Even so early in the morning they seemed\ninclined to burst into song. When the Detention Building gate opened for\nit, and closed again behind it, there was a welcoming committee in the\ncourtyard. It included a jailer with a bandaged head and a look of\nvengeful satisfaction on his face, and no less than three guards who had\nbeen given baths by a high-pressure hose when Bron Hoddan departed from\nhis cell. They wore unamiable expressions.\n\nAnd then, while the box swore very bitterly, somebody tenderly loosened\na plank--being careful not to disturb the diplomatic seal--and pulled it\naway with a triumphant gesture. Then all the police could look into the\nbox. And they did.\n\nThen there was dead silence, except for the voice that came from a\ntwo-way communicator set inside.\n\n\"_And now_,\" said the voice from the box--and only now did anybody\nnotice what the muffling effect of the boards had hidden, that it was a\nspeaker-unit which had sworn and coughed and sneezed--\"_we take our\nleave of the planet Walden and its happy police force, who wave to us as\nour space-liner lifts toward the skies. The next sound you hear will be\nthat of their lamentations at our departure._\"\n\nBut the next sound was a howl of fury. The police were very much\ndisappointed to learn that Hoddan hadn't been in the box, but only\none-half of a two-way communication pair, and that Hoddan had coughed\nand sneezed and sworn at them from the other instrument somewhere else.\nNow he signed off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe space liner was not lifting off just yet. It was still solidly\naground in the center of the landing grid. Hoddan had bade farewell to\nhis audience from the floor of the ambassador's ground-car, which at\nthat moment was safely within the extra-territorial circle about the\nspaceship. He turned off the set and got up and brushed himself off. He\ngot out of the car. The ambassador followed him and shook his hand.\n\n\"You have a touch,\" said the ambassador sedately. \"You seem inspired at\ntimes, Hoddan! You have a gift for infuriating constituted authority.\nYou should plot at your art. You may go far!\"\n\nHe shook hands again and watched Hoddan walk into the lift which should\nraise him--and did raise him--to the entrance port of the space liner.\n\nTwenty minutes later the force fields of the giant landing grid lifted\nthe liner smoothly out to space. The twenty-thousand-ton vessel went\nout to five planetary diameters, where its Lawlor drive could take hold\nof relatively unstressed space. There the ship jockeyed for line, and\nthen there was that curious, momentary disturbance of all one's\nsensations which was the effect of the overdrive field going on. Then\neverything was normal again, except that the liner was speeding for the\nplanet Krim at something more than thirty times the speed of light.\n\nNormality extended through all the galaxy so far inhabited by men. There\nwere worlds on which there was peace, and worlds on which there was\ntumult. There were busy, zestful young worlds, and languid, weary old\nones. From the Near Rim to the farthest of occupied systems, planets\ncircled their suns, and men lived on them, and every man took himself\nseriously and did not quite believe that the universe had existed before\nhe was born or would long survive his loss.\n\nTime passed. Comets let out vast streamers like bridal veils and swept\ntoward and around their suns. Some of them--one in ten thousand, or\ntwenty--were possibly seen by human eyes. The liner bearing Hoddan sped\nthrough the void.\n\nIn time it made a landfall on the Planet Krim. He went aground and\nobserved the spaceport city. It was new and bustling with tall buildings\nand traffic jams and a feverish conviction that the purpose of living\nwas to earn more money this year than last. Its spaceport was\nchaotically busy. Hoddan had time for swift sightseeing of one city only\nand an estimate of what the people of such a planet would be sure they\nwanted. He saw slums and gracious public buildings, and went back to the\nspaceport and the liner which then rose upon the landing grid's force\nfields until Krim was a great round ball below it. Then there was again\na jockeying for line, and the liner winked out of sight and was again\njourneying at thirty times the speed of light.\n\nAgain time passed. In one of the remoter galaxies a super-nova flamed,\nand on a rocky, barren world a small living thing squirmed\nexperimentally--and to mankind the one event was just as important as\nthe other.\n\nBut presently the liner from Krim and Walden appeared in Darth as the\ntiniest of shimmering pearly specks against the blue. To the north and\neast and west of the spaceport, rugged mountains rose steeply. Patches\nof snow showed here and there, and naked rock reared boldly in spurs and\nprecipices. But there were trees on all the lower slopes, and there was\nnot really a timberline.\n\nThe space liner increased in size, descending toward the landing grid.\nThe grid itself was a monstrous lattice of steel, half a mile high and\nenclosing a circle not less in diameter. It filled much the larger part\nof the level valley floor, and horned _duryas_ and what Hoddan later\nlearned were horses grazed in it. The animals paid no attention to the\ndeep-toned humming noise the grid made in its operation.\n\nThe ship seemed the size of a pea. Presently it was the size of an\napple. Then it was the size of a basketball, and then it swelled\nenormously and put out spidery metal legs with large splay metal feet on\nthem and alighted and settled gently to the ground. The humming stopped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were shoutings. Whips cracked. Straining, horn-tossing _duryas_\nheaved and dragged something, very deliberately, out from between\nwarehouses under the arches of the grid. There were two dozen of the\n_duryas_, and despite the shouts and whip-crackings they moved with a\nstubborn slowness. It took a long time for the object with the\nwide-tired wheels to reach a spot below the spacecraft. Then it took\nlonger, seemingly, for brakes to be set on each wheel, and then for the\ndraught animals to be arranged to pull as two teams against each other.\n\nMore shoutings and whip-crackings. A long, slanting, ladderlike arm\narose. It teetered, and a man with a lurid purple cloak rose with it at\nits very end. The ship's air lock opened and a crewman threw a rope. The\npurple-cloaked man caught it and made it fast. From somewhere inside the\nship of space the line was hauled in. The end of the landing ramp\ntouched the sill of the air lock. Somebody made other things fast and\nthe purple-cloaked man triumphantly entered the ship.\n\nThere was a pause. Men loaded carts with cargo to be sent to remote and\nunimagined planets. In the air lock, Bron Hoddan stepped to the\nunloading ramp and descended to the ground. He was the only passenger.\nHe had barely reached a firm footing when objects followed him. His own\nship bag--a gift from the ambassador--and then parcels, bales, boxes,\nand such nondescript items of freight as needed special designation.\nRolls of wire. Long strings of plastic objects, strung like beads on\nshipping cords. Plexiskins of fluid which might be anything from wine to\nfuel oil in less than bulk-cargo quantities. For a mere five minutes the\nflow of freight continued. Darth was not an important center of trade.\n\nHoddan stared incredulously at the town outside one side of the grid. It\nwas only a town--and was almost a village, at that. Its houses had\nsteep, gabled roofs, of which some seemed to be tile and others thatch.\nIts buildings leaned over the narrow streets, which were unpaved. They\nlooked like mud. And there was not a power-driven ground vehicle\nanywhere in sight, nor anything man made in the air.\n\nGreat carts trailed out to the unloading belt. They dumped bales of\nskins and ingots of metal, and more bales and more ingots. Those objects\nrode up to the air lock and vanished. Hoddan was ignored. He felt that\nwithout great care he might be crowded back into the reversed loading\nbelt and be carried back into the ship.\n\nThe loading process ended. The man with the purple cloak, who'd ridden\nthe teetering belt-beam up, reappeared and came striding grandly down to\nground. Somebody cast off, above. Ropes writhed and fell and dangled.\nThe ship's air lock door closed.\n\nThere was a vast humming sound. The ship lifted sedately. It seemed to\nhover momentarily over the group of _duryas_ and humans in the center of\nthe grid's enclosure. But it was not hovering. It shrank. It was rising\nin an absolutely vertical line. It dwindled to the size of a basketball\nand then an apple. Then to the size of a pea. And then that pea\ndiminished until the spaceship from Krim, Walden, Cetis, Rigel and the\nNearer Rim had become the size of a dust mote and then could not be seen\nat all. But one knew that it was going on to Lohala and Tralee and\nFamagusta and the Coalsack Stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan shrugged and began to trudge toward the warehouses. The\n_durya_-drawn landing ramp began to roll slowly in the same direction.\nCarts and wagons loaded the stuff discharged from the ship. Creaking,\nplodding, with the curved horns of the _duryas_ rising and falling, the\nwagons overtook Hoddan and passed him. He saw his ship bag on one of the\ncarts. It was a gift from the Interstellar Ambassador on Walden. He'd\nassured Hoddan that there was a fund for the assistance of political\nrefugees, and that the bag and its contents was normal. But in addition\nto the gift-clothing, Hoddan had a number of stun-pistols, formerly\nequipment of the police department of Walden's capital city.\n\nHe followed his bag to a warehouse. Arrived there, he found the bag\nsurrounded by a group of whiskered or mustachioed Darthian characters\nwearing felt pants and large sheath-knives. They had opened the bag and\nwere in the act of ferocious dispute about who should get what of its\ncontents. Incidentally they argued over the stun-pistols, which looked\nlike weapons but weren't because nothing happened when one pulled the\ntrigger. Hoddan grimaced. They'd been in store on the liner during the\nvoyage. Normally they picked up a trickle charge from broadcast power,\non Walden, but there was no broadcast power on the liner, nor any on\nDarth. They'd leaked their charges and were quite useless. The one in\nhis pocket would be useless, too.\n\nHe grimaced again and swerved to the building where the landing grid\ncontrols must be. He opened the door and went in. The interior was smoky\nand ill-smelling, but the equipment was wholly familiar. Two unshaven\nmen--in violently colored shirts--languidly played cards. Only one, a\nredhead, paid attention to the controls of the landing grid. He watched\ndials. As Hoddan pushed his way in, he threw a switch and yawned. The\nship was five diameters out from Darth, and he'd released it from the\nlanding grid fields. He turned and saw Hoddan.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"What the hell do you want?\" he demanded sharply.\n\n\"A few kilowatts,\" said Hoddan. The redhead's manner was not amiable.\n\n\"Get outta here!\" he barked.\n\nThe transformers and snaky cables leading to relays outside--all were\nclear as print to Hoddan. He moved confidently toward an especially\nunderstandable panel, pulling out his stun-pistol and briskly breaking\nback the butt for charging. He shoved the pistol butt to contact with\ntwo terminals devised for another purpose, and the pistol slipped for an\ninstant and a blue spark flared.\n\n\"Quit that!\" roared the red-headed man. The unshaven men pushed back\nfrom their game of cards. One of them stood up, smiling unpleasantly.\n\nThe stun-pistol clicked. Hoddan withdrew it from charging-contact,\nflipped the butt shut, and turned toward the three men. Two of them\ncharged him suddenly--the redhead and the unpleasant smiler.\n\nThe stun-pistol hummed. The redhead howled. He'd been hit in the hand.\nHis unshaven companion buckled in the middle and fell to the floor. The\nthird man backed away in panic, automatically raising his arms in\nsurrender.\n\nHoddan saw no need for further action. He nodded graciously and went out\nof the control building, swinging the recharged pistol in his hand. In\nthe warehouse, argument still raged over his possessions. He went in,\nbriskly. Nobody looked at him. The casual appropriation of unguarded\nproperty was apparently a social norm, here. The man in the purple cloak\nwas insisting furiously that he was a Darthian gentleman and he'd have\nhis share or else--\n\n\"Those things,\" said Hoddan, \"are mine. Put them back.\"\n\nFaces turned to him, expressing shocked surprise. A man in dirty yellow\npants stood up with a suit of Hoddan's underwear and a pair of shoes. He\nmoved with great dignity to depart.\n\nThe stun-pistol buzzed. He leaped and howled and fled. Hoddan had aimed\naccurately enough, but prudence suggested that if he appeared to kill\nanybody, the matter might become serious. So he'd fired to sting the man\nwith a stun-pistol bolt at about the same spot where, on Walden, he'd\nscorched members of a party of police in ambush. It was nice shooting.\nBut this happened to be a time and place where prudence did not pay.\n\nThere was a concerted gasp of outrage. Men leaped to their feet. Large\nknives came out of elaborate holsters. Figures in all the colors of the\nrainbow--all badly soiled--roared their indignation and charged at\nHoddan. They waved knives as they came.\n\nHe held down the stun-pistol trigger and traversed the rushing men. The\nwhining buzz of the weapon was inaudible, at first, but before he\nreleased the trigger it was plainly to be heard. Then there was silence.\nHis attackers formed a very untidy heap on the floor. They breathed\nstertorously. Hoddan began to retrieve his possessions. He rolled a man\nover, for the purpose.\n\nA pair of very blue, apprehensive eyes stared at him. Their owner had\nstumbled over one man and been stumbled over by others. He gazed up at\nHoddan, speechless.\n\n\"Hand me that, please,\" said Hoddan. He pointed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man in the purple cloak obeyed, shaking. Hoddan completed the\nrecovery of all his belongings. He turned. The man in the purple cloak\nwinced and closed his eyes.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Hoddan. He needed information. He wasn't likely to get it\nfrom the men in the grid's control room. He would hardly be popular with\nany of these, either. He irritably suspected himself of a tendency to\nmake enemies unnecessarily. But he did need directions. He said: \"I have\na letter of introduction to one Don Loris, prince of something-or-other,\nlord of this, baron of that, and claimant to the dukedom of the other\nthing. Would you have any idea how I could reach him?\"\n\nThe man in the purple cloak gaped at Hoddan.\n\n\"He is ... my chieftain,\" he said, aghast. \"I ... am Thal, his most\ntrusted retainer.\" Then he practically wailed, \"You must be the man I\nwas sent to meet! He sent me to learn if you came on the ship! I should\nhave fought by your side! This is disgrace!\"\n\n\"It's disgraceful,\" agreed Hoddan grimly. But he, who had been born and\nraised in a space-pirate community, should not be too critical of\nothers. \"Let it go. How do I find him?\"\n\n\"I should take you!\" complained Thal bitterly. \"But you have killed all\nthese men. Their friends and chieftains are honor bound to cut your\nthroat! And you shot Merk, but he ran away, and he will be summoning his\nfriends to come and kill you now! This is shame! This is--\" Then he said\nhopefully: \"Your strange weapon! How many men can you fight? If fifty,\nwe may live to ride away. If more, we may even reach Don Loris' castle.\nHow many?\"\n\n\"We'll see what we see,\" said Hoddan dourly. \"But I'd better charge\nthese other pistols. You can come with me, or wait. I haven't killed\nthese men. They're only stunned. They'll come around presently.\"\n\nHe went out of the warehouse, carrying the bag which was again loaded\nwith uncharged stun-pistols. He went back to the grid's control room. He\npushed it open and entered for the second time. The red-headed man swore\nand rubbed at his hand. The man who'd smiled unpleasantly lay in a heap\non the floor. The second unshaven man jittered visibly at sight of\nHoddan.\n\n\"I'm back,\" said Hoddan politely, \"for more kilowatts.\"\n\nHe put his bag conveniently close to the terminals at which his pistols\ncould be recharged. He snapped open a pistol butt and presented it to\nthe electric contacts.\n\n\"Quaint customs you have here,\" he said conversationally. \"Robbing a\nnewcomer. Resenting his need for a few watts of power that comes free\nfrom the sky.\" The stun-pistol clicked. He snapped the butt shut and\nopened another, which he placed in contact for charging. \"Making him\nact,\" he said acidly, \"with manners as bad as the local ones. Going at\nhim with knives so he has to be resentful in his turn.\" The second\nstun-pistol clicked. He closed it and began to charge a third. He said\nseverely: \"Innocent tourists--relatively innocent ones, anyhow--are not\nlikely to be favorably impressed with Darth!\" He had the charging\nprocess going swiftly now. He began to charge a fourth weapon. \"It's\nparticularly bad manners,\" he added sternly, \"to stand there grinding\nyour teeth at me while your friend behind the desk crawls after an\nold-fashioned chemical gun to shoot me with.\"\n\nHe snapped the fourth pistol shut and went after the man who'd dropped\ndown behind a desk. He came upon that man, hopelessly panicked, just as\nhis hands closed on a clumsy gun that was supposed to set off a chemical\nexplosive to propel a metal bullet.\n\n\"Don't!\" said Hoddan severely. \"If I have to shoot you at this range,\nyou'll have blisters!\"\n\nHe took the weapon out of the other man's hands. He went back and\nfinished charging the rest of the pistols.\n\nHe returned most of them to his bag, though he stuck others in his belt\nand pockets to the point where he looked like the fiction-tape pictures\nof space pirates. But he knew what space pirates were actually like. He\nmoved to the door. As a last thought, he picked up the bullet-firing\nweapon.\n\n\"There's only one spaceship here a month,\" he observed politely, \"so\nI'll be around. If you want to get in touch with me, ask Don Loris. I'm\ngoing to visit him while I look over professional opportunities on\nDarth.\"\n\nHe went out once more. Somehow he felt more cheerful than a half-hour\nsince, when he'd landed as the only passenger from the space liner. Then\nhe'd felt ignored and lonely and friendless on a strange and primitive\nworld. He still had no friends, but he had already acquired some enemies\nand therefore material for more or less worthwhile achievement. He\nsurveyed the sunlit scene about him from the control-room door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThal, the purple-cloaked man, had brought two shaggy-haired animals\naround to the door of the warehouse. Hoddan later learned that they were\nhorses. He was frenziedly in the act of mounting one of them. As he\nclimbed up, small bright metal disks cascaded from a pocket. He tried to\nstop the flow of money as he got feverishly into the saddle.\n\nFrom the gable-roofed small town a mob of some thirty mounted men\nplunged toward the landing grid. They wore garments of yellow and blue\nand magenta. They waved large-bladed knives and made bloodthirsty\nnoises. Thal saw them and bolted, riding one horse and towing the other\nby a lead rope. It happened that his line of retreat passed by where\nHoddan stood.\n\nHoddan held up his hand. Thal reined in.\n\n\"Mount!\" he cried hoarsely. \"Mount and ride!\"\n\nHoddan passed up the chemical--powder--gun. Thal seized it frantically.\n\n\"Hurry!\" he panted. \"Don Loris would have my throat cut if I deserted\nyou! Mount and ride!\"\n\nHoddan painstakingly fastened his bag to the saddle of the lead horse.\nHe unfastened the lead rope. He'd noticed that Thal pulled in the\nleather reins to stop the horse. He'd seen that he kicked it furiously\nto urge it on. He deduced that one steered the animal by pulling on one\nstrap or the other. He climbed clumsily to a seat.\n\nThere was a howl from the racing, mounted men. They waved their knives\nand yelled in zestful anticipation of murder.\n\nHoddan pulled on a rein. His horse turned obediently. He kicked it. The\nanimal broke into a run toward the rushing mob. The jolting motion\namazed Hoddan. One could not shoot straight while being shaken up like\nthis! He dragged back on the reins. The horse stopped.\n\n\"Come!\" yelled Thal despairingly. \"This way! Quick!\"\n\nHoddan got out a stun-pistol. Sitting erect, frowning a little in his\nconcentration, he began to take pot-shots at the charging small horde.\n\nThree of them got close enough to be blistered when stun-pistol bolts\nhit them. Others toppled from their saddles at distances ranging from\none hundred yards to twenty. A good dozen, however, saw what was\nhappening in time to swerve their mounts and hightail it away. But there\nwere eighteen luridly-tinted heaps of garments on the ground inside the\nlanding grid. Two or three of them squirmed and swore. Hoddan had partly\nmissed, on them. He heard the chemical weapon booming thunderously. Now\nthat victory was won, Thal was shooting valorously. Hoddan held up his\nhand for cease fire. Thal rode up beside him, not quite believing what\nhe'd seen.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" he said shakily. \"Wonderful! Don Loris will be pleased! He\nwill give me gifts for my help to you! This is a great fight! We will be\ngreat men, after this!\"\n\n\"Then let's go and brag,\" said Hoddan.\n\nThal was shocked.\n\n\"You need me,\" he said commiseratingly. \"It is fortunate that Don Loris\nchose me to fight beside you!\"\n\nHe sent his horse trotting toward the mostly unconscious men on the\nground. He alighted. Hoddan saw him happily and publicly pick the\npockets of the stun-gun's victims. He came back, beaming and now\nswaggering in his saddle.\n\n\"We will be famous!\" he said zestfully. \"Two against thirty, and some\nran away!\" He gloated. \"And it was a good haul! We share, of course,\nbecause we are companions.\"\n\n\"Is it the custom,\" asked Hoddan mildly, \"to loot defenseless men?\"\n\n\"But of course!\" said Thal. \"How else can a gentleman live, if he has no\nchieftain to give him presents? You defeated them, so of course you take\ntheir possessions!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Hoddan. \"To be sure!\"\n\nHe rode on. The road was a mere horse track. Presently it was less than\nthat. He saw a frowning, battlemented stronghold away off to the left.\nThal openly hoped that somebody would come from that castle and try to\ncharge them toll for riding over their lord's land. After Hoddan had\nknocked them over with the stun-pistol, Thal would add to the heavy\nweight of coins already in his possession.\n\nIt did not look promising, in a way. But just before sunset, Hoddan saw\nthree tiny bright lights flash across the sky from west to east. They\nmoved in formation and at identical speeds. Hoddan knew a spaceship in\norbit when he saw one. He bristled, and muttered under his breath.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Thal. \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said,\" said Hoddan dourly, \"that I've got to do something about\nWalden. When they get an idea in their heads....\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAccording to the fiction tapes, the colonized worlds of the galaxy vary\nwildly from each other. In cold and unromantic fact, it isn't so. Space\ntravel is too cheap and sol-type solar systems too numerous to justify\nthe settlement of hostile worlds. There's no point in trying to live\nwhere one has to put on special equipment every time he goes outdoors.\nThere's no reason to settle on a world where one can't grow the kind of\nvegetation one's ancestors adapted themselves to some tens of thousands\nof generations ago. It simply doesn't make sense!\n\nSo the inhabited worlds of the galaxy are farther apart than they could\nbe, perhaps, and much more alike than is necessary. But the human race\nhas a predilection for gravity fields not too far from 980cm-sec\naccellerative force. We humans were designed for something like that. We\nprefer foodstuffs containing familiar amino compounds. Our metabolism\nwas designed around them. And since our geneticists have learned how to\nput aggressiveness into the genes of terrestrial-origin plants--why\nnowadays they briskly overwhelm the native flora wherever they are\nintroduced. And it's rational to let it happen. If people are to thrive\nand multiply on new worlds as they are colonized, it's more convenient\nto modify the worlds to fit the colonists than the colonists to fit the\nworlds.\n\nTherefore Bron Hoddan encountered no remarkable features in the\nlandscape of Darth as he rode through the deepening night. There was\ngrass, which was not luxuriant. There were bushes, which were not unduly\nlush. There were trees, and birds, and various other commonplace living\nthings whose forebears had been dumped on Darth some centuries before.\nThe ecological system had worked itself out strictly by hit-or-miss, but\nthe result was not unfamiliar. Save for the star-pattern overhead,\nHoddan could have believed himself on some parts of Zan, or some parts\nof Walden, or very probably somewhere or other on Lohala or Kent or\nFamagusta or any other occupied world between the Rims.\n\nThere was, though, the star-pattern. Hoddan tried to organize it in his\nmind. He knew where the sun had set, which would be west. He asked the\nlatitude of the Darthian spaceport. Thal did not know it. He asked about\nmajor geographical features--seas and continents and so on. Thal had no\nideas on the subject.\n\nHoddan fumed. He hadn't worried about such things on Walden. Of course,\non Walden he'd had one friend, Derec, and believed he had a sweetheart,\nNedda. There he was lonely and schemed to acquire the admiration of\nothers. He ignored the sky. Here on Darth he had no friends, but there\nwere a number of local citizens now doubtless recovered from\nstun-pistol bolts and yearning to carve him up with large knives. He did\nnot feel lonely, but the instinct to know where he was, was again in\noperation.\n\nThe ground was rocky and far from level. After two hours of riding on a\nsmall and wiry horse with no built-in springs, Hoddan hurt in a great\nmany places he'd never known he owned. He and Thal rode in an\nindeterminate direction with an irregular scarp of low mountains\nsilhouetted against the unfamiliar stars. A vagrant night-wind blew.\nThal had said it was a three-hour ride to Don Loris' castle. After\nsomething over two of them, he said meditatively:\n\n\"I think that if you wish to give me a present I will take it and not\nmake a gift in return. You could give me,\" he added helpfully, \"your\nshare of the plunder from our victims.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Hoddan. \"Why should I give you a present?\"\n\n\"If I accepted it,\" explained Thal, \"and made no gift in return, I would\nbecome your retainer. Then it would be my obligation as a Darthian\ngentleman to ride beside you, advise, counsel, and fight in your\ndefense, and generally to uphold your dignity.\"\n\nHoddan suspected himself of blisters in places that had no dignity about\nthem. He said suspiciously:\n\n\"How about Don Loris? Aren't you his retainer?\"\n\n\"Between the two of us,\" said Thal, \"he's stingy. His presents are not\nas lavish as they could be. I can make him a return-present of part of\nthe money we won in combat. That frees me of duty to him. Then I could\naccept the balance of the money from you, and become a retainer of\nyours.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"You need a retainer badly,\" said Thal. \"You do not know the customs\nhere. For example, there is enmity between Don Loris and the young Lord\nGhek. If the young Lord Ghek is as enterprising as he should be, some of\nhis retainers should be lying in wait to cut our throats as we approach\nDon Loris' stronghold.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Hoddan grimly. But Thal seemed undisturbed. \"This system\nof gifts and presents sounds complicated. Why doesn't Don Loris simply\ngive you so much a year, or week, or whatnot?\"\n\nThal made a shocked sound.\n\n\"That would be pay! A Darthian gentleman does not serve for pay! To\noffer it would be insult!\" Then he said, \"Listen!\"\n\nHe reined in. Hoddan clumsily followed his example. After a moment or\ntwo Thal clucked to his horse and started off again.\n\n\"It was nothing,\" he said regretfully. \"I hoped we were riding into an\nambush.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan grunted. It could be that he was being told a tall tale. But back\nat the spaceport, the men who came after him waving large knives had\nseemed sincere enough.\n\n\"Why should we be ambushed?\" he asked. \"And why do you hope for it?\"\n\n\"Your weapons would destroy our enemies,\" said Thal placidly, \"and the\npickings would be good.\" He added: \"We should be ambushed because the\nLady Fani refused to marry the Lord Ghek. She is Don Loris' daughter,\nand to refuse to marry a man is naturally a deadly insult. So he should\nravage Don Loris' lands at every opportunity until he gets a chance to\ncarry off the Lady Fani and marry her by force. That is the only way the\ninsult can be wiped out.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Hoddan ironically.\n\nHe didn't. The two horses topped a rise, and far in the distance there\nwas a yellow light, with a mist above it as of illuminated smoke.\n\n\"That is Don Loris' stronghold,\" said Thal. He sighed. \"It looks like we\nmay not be ambushed.\"\n\nThey weren't. It was very dark where the horses forged ahead through\nbrushwood. As they moved onward, the single light became two. They were\ngreat bonfires burning in iron cages some forty feet up in the air.\nThose cages projected from the battlements of a massive, cut-stone wall.\nThere was no light anywhere else underneath the stars.\n\nThal rode almost underneath the cressets and shouted upward. A voice\nanswered. Presently a gate clanked open and a black, cavelike opening\nappeared behind it. Thal rode grandly in, and Hoddan followed. Now that\nthe ride seemed over, he let himself realize where he ached from the\nunaccustomed exercise. Everywhere. He also guessed at the area of his\nskin first rubbed to blisters and then to the discomfort of raw flesh\nunderneath.\n\nThe gate clanked shut. Torches waved overhead. Hoddan found that he and\nThal had ridden into a very tiny courtyard. Twenty feet above them, an\ninner battlemented wall offered excellent opportunities for the\ninhabitants of the castle to throw things down at visitors who after\nadmission turned out to be undesired.\n\nThal shouted further identifications, including a boastful and entirely\nuntruthful declaration that he and Hoddan, together, had slaughtered\ntwenty men in one place and thirty in another, and left them lying in\ntheir gore.\n\nThe voices that replied sounded derisive. Somebody came down a rope and\nfastened the gate from the inside. With an extreme amount of creaking,\nan inner gate swung wide. Men came out of it and took the horses. Hoddan\ndismounted, and it seemed to him that he creaked as loudly as the gate.\nThal swaggered, displaying coins he had picked from the pockets of the\nmen the stun-pistols had disabled. He said splendidly to Hoddan:\n\n\"I go to announce your coming to Don Loris. These are his retainers.\nThey will give you to drink.\" He added amiably, \"If you were given food,\nit would be disgraceful to cut your throat.\"\n\nHe disappeared. Hoddan carried his ship bag and followed a man in a\ndirty pink shirt to a stone-walled room containing a table and a chair.\nHe sat down, relieved to have a rest for his back. The man in the pink\nshirt brought him a flagon of wine. He disappeared again.\n\nHoddan drank sour wine and brooded. He was very hungry and very tired,\nand it seemed to him that he had been disillusioned in a new dimension.\nMorbidly, he remembered a frequently given lecture from his grandfather\non Zan.\n\n\"It's no use!\" it was the custom of his grandfather to say. \"There's not\na bit o' use in having brains! All they do is get you into trouble! A\nlucky idiot's ten times better off than a brainy man with a jinx on him!\nA smart man starts thinkin', and he thinks himself into a jail cell if\nhis luck is bad, and good luck's wasted on him because it ain't\nreasonable and he don't believe in it when it happens! It's taken me a\nlifetime to keep my brains from ruinin' me! No, sir! I hope none o' my\ndescendants inherit my brains! I pity 'em if they do!\"\n\nHoddan had been on Darth not more than four hours. In that time he'd\nfound himself robbed, had resented it, had been the object of two\nspirited attempts at assassination, had ridden an excruciating number of\nmiles on an unfamiliar animal, and now found himself in a stone dungeon\nand deprived of food lest feeding him obligate his host not to cut his\nthroat. And he'd gotten into this by himself! He'd chosen it! He'd\npractically asked for it!\n\nHe began strongly to share his grandfather's disillusioned view of\nbrains.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a long time the door of the cell opened. Thal was back, chastened.\n\n\"Don Loris wants to talk to you,\" he said in a subdued voice. \"He's not\npleased.\"\n\nHoddan took another gulp of the wine. He picked up his ship bag and\nlimped to the door. He decided painfully that he was limping on the\nwrong leg. He tried the other. No improvement. He really needed to limp\non both.\n\nHe followed a singularly silent Thal through a long stone corridor and\nup stone steps until they came to a monstrous hall with torches in\nholders on the side walls. It was barbarically hung with banners, but it\nwas not exactly a cheery place. At the far end logs burned in a great\nfireplace.\n\nDon Loris sat in a carved chair beside it; wizened and white-bearded, in\na fur-trimmed velvet robe, with a peevish expression on his face.\n\n\"My chieftain,\" said Thal subduedly, \"here is the engineer from Walden.\"\n\nHoddan scowled at Don Loris, whose expression of peevishness did not\nlighten. He did regard Hoddan with a flicker of interest, however. A\nstranger who unfeignedly scowls at a feudal lord with no superior and\nmany inferiors is anyhow a novelty.\n\n\"Thal tells me,\" said Don Loris fretfully, \"that you and he, together,\nslaughtered some dozens of the retainers of my neighbors today. I\nconsider it unfortunate. They may ask me to have the two of you hanged,\nand it would be impolite to refuse.\"\n\nHoddan said truculently:\n\n\"I considered it impolite for your neighbors' retainers to march toward\nme waving large knives and announcing what they intended to do to my\ninwards with them!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Don Loris impatiently. \"I concede that point. It is\nnatural enough to act hastily at such times. But still-- How many did you\nkill?\"\n\n\"None,\" said Hoddan curtly. \"I shot them with stun-pistols I'd just\ncharged in the control room of the landing grid.\"\n\nDon Loris sat up straight.\n\n\"Stun-pistols?\" he demanded sharply. \"You used stun-pistols on Darth?\"\n\n\"Naturally on Darth,\" said Hoddan with some tartness. \"I was here! But\nnobody was killed. One or two may be slightly blistered. All of them had\ntheir pockets picked by Thal. I understand that is a local custom.\nThere's nothing to worry about.\"\n\nBut Don Loris stared at him, aghast.\n\n\"But this is deplorable!\" he protested. \"Stun-pistols used here? It is\nthe one thing I would have given strict orders to avoid! My neighbors\nwill talk about it. Some of them may even think about it! You could have\nused any other weapon, but of all things why did you have to use a\nstun-pistol?\"\n\n\"Because I had one,\" said Hoddan briefly.\n\n\"Horrible!\" said Don Loris peevishly. \"The worst thing you could\npossibly have done! I have to disown you. Unmistakably! You'll have to\ndisappear at once. We'll blame it on Ghek's retainers.\"\n\nHoddan said:\n\n\"Disappear? Me?\"\n\n\"Vanish,\" said Don Loris. \"I suppose there's no real necessity to cut\nyour throat, but you plainly have to disappear, though it would have\nbeen much more discreet if you'd simply gotten killed.\"\n\n\"I was indiscreet to survive?\" demanded Hoddan bristling.\n\n\"Extremely so!\" snapped Don Loris. \"Here I had you come all the way from\nWalden to help arrange a delicate matter, and before you'd traveled even\nthe few miles to my castle--within minutes of landing on Darth!--you\nspoiled everything! I am a reasonable man, but there are the facts! You\nused stun-pistols, so you have to disappear. I think it generous for me\nto say only until people on Darth forget that such things exist. But the\ntwo of you ... oh, for a year or so ... there are some fairly cozy\ndungeons--\"\n\nHoddan seethed suddenly. He'd tried to do something brilliant on Walden,\nand had been framed for jail for life. He'd defended his life and\nproperty on Darth, and nearly the same thing popped up as a prospect.\nHoddan angrily suspected fate and chance of plain conspiracy against\nhim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there was an interruption. A clanking of arms sounded somewhere\nnearby. Men with long, gruesome, glittering spears came through a\ndoorway. They stood aside. A girl entered the great hall. More spearmen\nfollowed her. They stopped by the door. The girl came across the hall.\n\nShe was a pretty girl, but Hoddan hardly noticed the fact. With so many\nother things on his mind, he had no time for girls.\n\nThal, behind him, said in a quivering voice:\n\n\"My Lady Fani, I beg you to plead with your father for his most faithful\nretainer!\"\n\nThe girl looked surprisedly at him. Her eyes fell on Hoddan. She looked\ninterested. Hoddan, at that moment, was very nearly as disgusted and as\nindignant as a man could be. He did not look romantically at her--which\nto the Lady Fani, daughter of that Don Loris who was prince of this and\nbaron of that and so on, was news. He did not look at her at all. He\nground his teeth.\n\n\"Don't try to wheedle me, Fani!\" snapped Don Loris. \"I am a reasonable\nman, but I indulge you too much--even to allowing you to refuse that\nyoung imbecile Ghek, with no end of inconvenience as a result. But I\nwill not have you question my decision about Thal and this Hoddan\nperson!\"\n\nThe girl said pleasantly:\n\n\"Of course not, Father. But what have they done?\"\n\n\"The two of them,\" snapped Don Loris again, \"fought twenty men today and\ndefeated all of them! Thal plundered them. Then thirty other men,\nmounted, tried to avenge the first and they defeated them also! Thal\nplundered eighteen. And all this was permissible, if unlikely. But they\ndid it with stun-pistols! Everybody within news range will talk of it!\nThey'll know that this Hoddan came to Darth to see me! They'll suspect\nthat I imported new weapons for political purposes! They'll guess at the\nprettiest scheme I've had these twenty years!\"\n\nThe girl stood still. A spearman leaned his weapon against the wall,\nraced across the hall, shifted a chair to a convenient position for the\nLady Fani to sit on it, and raced back to his fellows. She sat down.\n\n\"But did they really defeat so many?\" she asked, marveling. \"That's\nwonderful! And Thal was undoubtedly fighting in defense of someone you'd\ntold him to protect, as a loyal retainer should do. Wasn't he?\"\n\n\"I wish,\" fumed her father, \"that you would not throw in irrelevances! I\nsent him to bring this Hoddan here this afternoon, not to massacre my\nneighbors' retainers--or rather, not to not massacre them. A little\nblood-letting would have done no harm, but stun-pistols--\"\n\n\"He was protecting somebody he was told to protect,\" said Fani. \"And\nthis other man, this--\"\n\n\"Hoddan. Bron Hoddan,\" said her father irritably. \"Yes. He was\nprotecting himself! Doubtless he thought he did me a service in doing\nthat! But if he'd only let himself get killed quietly the whole affair\nwould be simplified!\"\n\nThe Lady Fani said with quiet dignity:\n\n\"By the same reasoning, Father, it would simplify things greatly if I\nlet the Lord Ghek kidnap me.\"\n\n\"It's not the same thing at all--\"\n\n\"At least,\" said Fani, \"I wouldn't have a pack of spearmen following me\nabout like puppies everywhere I go!\"\n\n\"It's not the same--\"\n\n\"Their breaths smelling of wine except when they smell of beer, and they\nbreathe very noisily and--\"\n\n\"It's not--\"\n\n\"And it's especially unreasonable,\" said the Lady Fani with even greater\ndignity, \"when you could put Thal and this--Hoddan person on duty to\nguard me instead. If they can fight twenty and thirty men at once, all\nby themselves, it doesn't seem to me that you think much of my safety\nwhen you want to lock them up somewhere instead of using them to keep\nyour daughter safe from that particularly horrible Ghek!\"\n\nDon Loris swore in a cracked voice. Then he said:\n\n\"To end the argument I'll think it over. Until tomorrow. Now go away!\"\n\nFani, beaming, rose and kissed him on the forehead. He squirmed. She\nturned to leave, and beckoned casually for Thal and Hoddan to follow\nher.\n\n\"My chieftain,\" said Thal tremulously, \"do we depart, too?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" rasped Don Loris. \"Get out of my sight!\"\n\nThal moved with agility in the wake of the Lady Fani. Hoddan picked up\nhis bag and followed. This, he considered darkly, was in the nature of a\nreprieve only. And if those three spaceships overhead did come from\nWalden--but why three?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Lady Fani went out the door she'd entered by. Some of the spearmen\nwent ahead, and others closed in behind her. Hoddan followed. There were\nstone steps leading upward. They were steep and uneven and interminable.\nHoddan climbed on aching legs for what seemed ages.\n\nStars appeared. The leading spearmen stepped out on a flagstoned level\narea. When Hoddan got there he saw that they had arrived at the\nbattlements of a high part of the castle wall. Starlight showed a\nrambling wall of circumvallation, with peaked roofs inside it. He could\nlook down into a courtyard where a fire burned and several men busily\ndid things beside it. But there were no other lights. Beyond the castle\nwall the ground stretched away toward a nearby range of rugged low\nmountains. It was vaguely splotched with different degrees of darkness,\nwhere fields and pastures and woodland copses stood.\n\n\"Here's a bench,\" said Fani cheerfully, \"and you can sit down beside me\nand explain things. What's your name, again, and where did you come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"I'm Bron Hoddan,\" said Hoddan. He found himself scowling. \"I come from\nZan, where everybody is a space pirate. My grandfather heads the most\nnotorious of the pirate gangs.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" said Fani, admiringly. \"I knew you couldn't be just an\nordinary person and fight like my father said you did today!\"\n\nThal cleared his throat.\n\n\"Lady Fani--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Fani. \"You're a nice old fuddy-duddy that father sent to\nthe spaceport because he figured you'd be too timid to get into trouble.\nHush!\" To Hoddan she said interestedly, \"Now, tell me all about the\nfighting. It must have been terrible!\"\n\nShe watched him with her head on one side, expectantly.\n\n\"The fighting I did today,\" said Hoddan angrily, \"was exactly as\ndangerous and as difficult as shooting fish in a bucket. A little more\ntrouble, but not much.\"\n\nEven in the starlight he could see that her expression was more admiring\nthan before.\n\n\"I thought you'd say something like that!\" she said contentedly. \"Go\non!\"\n\n\"That's all,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"Quite all?\"\n\n\"I can't think of anything else,\" he told her. He added drearily: \"I\nrode a horse for three hours today. I'm not used to it. I ache. Your\nfather is thinking of putting me in a dungeon until some scheme or other\nof his goes through. I'm disappointed. I'm worried about three lights\nthat went across the sky at sundown and I'm simply too tired and\nbefuddled for normal conversation.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Fani.\n\n\"If I may take my leave,\" said Hoddan querulously, \"I'll get some rest\nand do some thinking when I get up. I'll hope to have more entertaining\nthings to say.\"\n\nHe got to his feet and picked up his bag.\n\n\"Where do I go?\" he asked.\n\nFani regarded him enigmatically. Thal squirmed.\n\n\"Thal will show you.\" Then Fani said deliberately, \"Bron Hoddan, will\nyou fight for me?\"\n\nThal plucked anxiously at his arm. Hoddan said politely:\n\n\"If at all desirable, yes. But now I must get some sleep.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Fani. \"I am troubled by the Lord Ghek.\"\n\nShe watched him move away. Thal, moaning softly, went with him down\nanother monstrosity of a stone stairway.\n\n\"Oh, what folly!\" mourned Thal. \"I tried to warn you! You would not pay\nattention! When the Lady Fani asked if you would fight for her, you\nshould have said if her father permitted you that honor. But you said\nyes! The spearmen heard you! Now you must either fight the Lord Ghek\nwithin a night and day or be disgraced!\"\n\n\"I doubt,\" said Hoddan tiredly, \"that the obligations of Darthian\ngentility apply to the grandson of a pirate or an escap.... To me.\"\n\nHe'd been about to say an escaped criminal from Walden, but caught\nhimself in time.\n\n\"But they do apply!\" said Thal, shocked. \"A man who has been disgraced\nhas no rights! Any man may plunder him, any man may kill him at will.\nBut if he resists plundering or kills anybody else in self-defense, he\nis hanged!\"\n\nHoddan stopped short in his descent of the uneven stone steps.\n\n\"That's me from now on?\" he said sardonically. \"Of course the Lady Fani\ndidn't mean to put me on such a spot!\"\n\n\"You were not polite,\" explained Thal. \"She'd persuaded her father out\nof putting us in a dungeon until he thought of us again. You should at\nleast have shown good manners! You should have said that you came here\nacross deserts and flaming oceans because of the fame of her beauty. You\nmight have said you heard songs of her sweetness beside campfires half a\nworld away. She might not have believed you, but--\"\n\n\"Hold it!\" said Hoddan. \"That's just manners? What would you say to a\ngirl you really liked?\"\n\n\"Oh, then,\" said Thal, \"you'd get complimentary!\"\n\nHoddan went heavily down the rest of the steps. He was not in the least\npleased. On a strange world, with strange customs, and with his weapons\nlosing their charge every hour, he did not need any handicaps. But if he\ngot into a worse-than-outlawed category such as Thal described--\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs he said, seething:\n\n\"When you've tucked me in bed, go back and ask the Lady Fani to arrange\nfor me to have a horse and permission to go fight this Lord Ghek right\nafter breakfast!\"\n\nHe was too much enraged to think further. He let himself be led into\nsome sort of quarters which probably answered Don Loris' description of\na cozy dungeon. Thal vanished and came back with ointments for Hoddan's\nblisters, but no food. He explained again that food given to Hoddan\nwould make it disgraceful to cut his throat. And Hoddan swore\npoisonously, but stripped off his garments and smeared himself lavishly\nwhere he had lost skin. The ointment stung like fire, and he presently\nlay awake in a sort of dreary fury. And he was ravenous!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to him that he lay awake for aeons, but he must have dozed off\nbecause he was awakened by a yell. It was not a complete yell; only the\nfirst part of one. It stopped in a particularly unpleasant fashion, and\nits echoes went reverberating through the stony walls of the castle.\nHoddan was out of bed with a stun-pistol in his hand in a hurry, before\nthat first yell was followed by other shouts and outcries, by the\nclashing of steel upon steel, and all the frenzied tumult of combat in\nthe dark. The uproar moved. In seconds the sound of fighting came from a\nplainly different direction, as if a striking force of some sort went\nrushing through only indifferently defended corridors.\n\nIt would not pass before Hoddan's door, but he growled to himself. On a\nfeudal world, presumably one might expect anything. But there was a\nsituation in being, here, in which etiquette required a rejected suitor\nto carry off a certain scornful maiden by force. Some young lordling\nnamed Ghek had to carry off Fani or be considered a man of no spirit.\n\nA gun went off somewhere. It was a powder gun, exploding violently to\nsend a metal bullet somewhere. It went off again. There was an instant\nalmost of silence. Then an intolerable screeching of triumph, and\nshrieks of another sort entirely, and the excessively loud clash of arms\nonce more.\n\nHoddan was clothed, now--at least clothed enough to have places to stick\nstun-pistols. He jerked on the door to open it, irritably demanding of\nhimself how he would know which side was which, or for that matter which\nside he should fight on.\n\nThe door was locked. He raged. He flung himself against it and it barely\nquivered. It was barred on the outside. He swore in highly indecorous\nterms, and tore his bedstead apart to get a battering-ram.\n\nThe fighting reached a climax. He heard a girl scream, and without\nquestion knew that it was the Lady Fani, and equally without question\nknew that he would fight to keep any girl from being abducted by a man\nshe didn't want to marry. He swung the log which was the corner post of\nhis bed. Something cracked. He swung again.\n\nThe sound of battle changed to that of a running fight. The objective of\nthe raiders had been reached. Having gotten what they came for--and it\ncould only be Fani--they retreated swiftly, fighting only to cover their\nretreat. Hoddan swung his bed leg with furious anger. He heard a flurry\nof yells and sword strokes, and a fierce, desperate cry from Fani among\nthem, and a plank in his guest-room-dungeon door gave way. He struck\nagain. The running raiders poured past a corner some yards away. He\nbattered and swore, swore and battered as the tumult moved, and he\nsuddenly heard a scurrying thunder of horses' hoofs outside the castle\naltogether. There were yells of derisive triumph and the pounding,\nrumbling sound of horses headed away in the night until it was lost.\n\nStill raging inarticulately, Hoddan crashed his small log at the door.\nHe was not consciously concerned about the distress Don Loris might feel\nover the abduction of his daughter. But there is an instinct in most men\nagainst the forcing of a girl to marriage against her will. Hoddan\nbattered at his door. Around him the castle began to hum like a hive of\nbees. Women cried out or exclaimed, and men shouted furiously to one\nanother, and off-duty fighting men came belatedly looking for somebody\nto fight, dragging weapons behind them and not knowing where to find\nenemies.\n\nBron Hoddan probably made as much noise as any four of them. Somebody\nbrought a light somewhere near. It shone through the cracks in the\nsplintered planks. He could see to aim. He smote savagely and the door\ncame apart. It fell outward and he found himself in the corridor\noutside, being stared at by complete strangers.\n\n\"It's the engineer,\" someone explained to someone else. \"I saw him when\nhe rode in with Thal.\"\n\n\"I want Thal,\" said Hoddan coldly. \"I want a dozen horses. I want men to\nride them with me.\" He pushed his way forward. \"Which way to the\nstables?\"\n\nBut then he went back and picked up his bag of stun-pistols. His air was\npurposeful and his manner furious. The retainers of Don Loris were in an\nextremely apologetic frame of mind. The Lady Fani had been carried off\ninto the night by a raiding party undoubtedly led by Lord Ghek. The\ndefenders of the castle hadn't prevented it. So there was no special\nreason to obey Hoddan, but there was every reason to seem to be doing\nsomething useful.\n\nHe found himself almost swept along by agitated retainers trying to look\nas if they were about a purposeful affair. They went down a long ramp,\ncalling uneasily to each other. They eddied around a place where two men\nlay quite still on the floor. Then there were shouts of, \"Thal! This\nway, Thal!\" and Hoddan found himself in a small stone-walled courtyard\ndoubtless inside a sally-port. It was filled with milling figures and\nmany waving torches. And there was Thal, desperately pale and\nfrightened. Behind him there was Don Loris, his eyes burning and his\nhands twitching, literally speechless from fury.\n\n\"Pick a dozen men, Thal!\" commanded Hoddan. \"Get 'em on horses! Get a\nhorse for me, dammit! I'll show 'em how to use the stun-pistols as we\nride!\"\n\nThal panted, shaking:\n\n\"They ... hamstrung most of the horses!\"\n\n\"Get the ones that are left!\" barked Hoddan. He suddenly raged at Don\nLoris. \"Here's another time stun-pistols get used on Darth! Object to\nthis if you want to!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoofbeats. Thal on a horse that shied and reared at the flames and\nconfusion. Other horses, skittish and scared, with the smell of spilt\nblood in their nostrils, fighting the men who led them, their eyes\nrolling.\n\nThal called names as he looked about him. There was plenty of light. As\nhe called a name, a man climbed on a horse. Men thrust swords,\nspears--all manner of weapons upon them. Some of the chosen men\nswaggered because of their choice. Some looked woefully unhappy. But\nwith Don Loris glaring frenziedly upon them in the smoky glare, no man\nrefused.\n\nHoddan climbed ungracefully upon the mount that four or five men held\nfor him. Thal, with a fine sense of drama, seized a torch and waved it\nabove his head. There was a vast creaking, and an unsuspected gate\nopened, and Thal rode out with a great clattering of hoofs and the\nothers rode out after him.\n\nThere were lights everywhere about the castle, now. All along the\nbattlements men had set light to fire-baskets and lowered them partway\ndown the walls, to disclose any attacking force which might have\ndishonorable intentions toward the stronghold. Others waved torches from\nthe battlements.\n\nThal swung his torch and pointed to the ground.\n\n\"They rode here!\" he called to Hoddan. \"They ride for Ghek's castle!\"\n\nHoddan said angrily:\n\n\"Put out that light! Do you want to advertise how few we are and what\nwe're doing? Here, ride close!\"\n\nThal flung down the torch and horses trod it underfoot as the knot of\nmen rode on. Thal boomed:\n\n\"The pickings should be good, eh? Why do you want me?\"\n\n\"You've got to learn something,\" snapped Hoddan. \"Here! This is a\nstun-pistol. It's set for single-shot firing only. You hold it so, with\nyour finger along this rod. You point your finger at a man and pull this\ntrigger. The pistol will buzz--briefly. You let the trigger loose and\npoint at another man and pull the trigger again. Understand? Don't try\nto use it over ten yards. You're no marksman!\"\n\nThere on a galloping horse beside Hoddan in the darkness, Thal zestfully\nrepeated his lesson.\n\n\"Show another man and send him to me for a pistol,\" Hoddan commanded\ncurtly. \"I'll be showing others.\"\n\nHe turned to the man who rode too close to his left. Before he had fully\ninstructed that man, another clamored for a weapon on his right.\n\nThis was hardly adequate training in the use of modern weapons. For that\nmatter, Hoddan was hardly qualified to give military instruction. He'd\nonly gone on two pirate voyages himself. But little boys on Zan played\nat pirate, in dutiful emulation of their parents. At least the\npossibilities of stun-guns were envisioned in their childish games. So\nHoddan knew more about how to fight with stun-pistols than somebody who\nknew nothing at all.\n\nThe band of pursuing horsemen pounded through the dark night under\nstrangely patterned stars. Hoddan held on to his saddle and barked out\ninstructions to teach Darthians how to shoot. He felt very queer. He\nbegan to worry. With the lights of Don Loris' castle long vanished\nbehind, he began to realize how very small his troop was.\n\nThal had said something about horses being hamstrung. There must, then,\nhave been two attacking parties. One swarmed into the stables to draw\nall defending retainers there. Then the other poured over a wall or in\nthrough a bribed-open sally-port, and rushed for the Lady Fani's\napartments. The point was that the attackers had made sure there could\nbe only a token pursuit. They knew they were many times stronger than\nany who might come after them. It would be absurd for them to flee....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan kicked his horse and got up to the front of the column of riders\nin the night.\n\n\"Thal!\" he snapped. \"They'll be idiots if they keep on running away, now\nthey're too far off to worry about men on foot. They'll stop and wait\nfor us--most of them anyhow. We're riding into an ambush!\"\n\n\"Good pickings, eh?\" said Thal.\n\n\"Idiot!\" yelped Hoddan. \"These men know you. You know what I can do with\nstun-pistols! Tell them we're riding into ambush. They're to follow\nclose behind us two! Tell them they're not to shoot at anybody more than\nfive yards off and not coming at them, and if any man stops to plunder\nI'll kill him personally!\"\n\nThal gaped at him.\n\n\"Not stop to plunder?\"\n\n\"Ghek won't!\" snapped Hoddan. \"He'll take Fani on to his castle, leaving\nmost of his men behind to massacre us!\"\n\nThal reined aside and Hoddan pounded on at the head of the tiny troop.\nThis was the second time in his life he'd been on a horse. It was two\ntoo many. This adventure was not exhilarating. It came into his mind,\ndepressingly, that supposedly stirring action like this was really no\nmore satisfying than piracy. Fani had tricked him into a fix in which he\nhad to fight Ghek or be disgraced--and to be disgraced on Darth was\nequivalent to suicide.\n\nHis horse came to a gentle rise in the ground. It grew steeper. The\nhorse slacked in its galloping. The incline grew steeper still. The\nhorse slowed to a walk, which it pursued with a rhythmically tossing\nhead. It was only less uncomfortable than a gallop. The dim outline of\ntrees appeared overhead.\n\n\"Perfect place for an ambush,\" Hoddan reflected dourly.\n\nHe got out a stun-pistol. He set the stud for continuous fire--something\nhe hadn't dared trust to the others.\n\nHis horse breasted the rise. There was a yell ahead and dim figures\nplunged toward him.\n\nHe painstakingly made ready to swing his stun-pistol from his extreme\nright, across the space before him, and all the way to the extreme left.\nThe pistol should be capable of continuous fire for four seconds. But it\nwas operating on stored charge. He didn't dare count on more than three.\n\nHe pulled the trigger. The stun-pistol hummed, though its noise was\ninaudible through the yells of the charging partisans of the Lord Ghek.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nHoddan swore from the depths of a very considerable vocabulary.\n\n\"You (censored)--(deleted)--(omitted)--(unprintability)\", he roared.\n\"Get back up on your horse or I blast you and leave you for Ghek's men\nto handle when they're able to move about again! Get back on that horse!\nOne--two--\"\n\nThe man got back on the horse.\n\n\"Now go on ahead,\" rasped Hoddan. \"All of you! I'm going to count you!\"\n\nThe dozen horsemen from Don Loris' stronghold rode reluctantly on ahead.\nHe did count them. He rode on, shepherding them before him.\n\n\"Ghek,\" he told them in a blood-curdling tone, \"has a bigger prize than\nany cash you'll plunder from one of his shot-down retainers! He's got\nthe Lady Fani! He won't stop before he has her behind castle walls!\nWe've got to catch up with him! Do you want to try to climb into his\ncastle by your fingernails? You'll do it if he gets there first!\"\n\nThe horses moved a little faster. Thal said with surprising humility:\n\n\"If we force our horses too much, they'll be exhausted before we can\ncatch up.\"\n\n\"Figure it out,\" snapped Hoddan. \"We have to catch up!\"\n\nHe settled down to more of the acute discomfort that riding was to him.\nHe did not think again of the ambush. It had happened, and it had\nfailed. Four-fifths of the raiding party that had fought its way into\nDon Loris' stronghold and out again, had been waiting for pursuers atop\na certain bit of rising ground. They'd known their pursuers must come\nthis way. There were certain passes through the low but rugged hills.\nOne went this way or that, but no other. Their blood already warmed by\npast fighting, when Hoddan and his dozen seemed to ride right into\ndestruction, they flung themselves into a charge.\n\nBut Hoddan had a stun-pistol set for continuous fire. He used it like a\nhose or a machine gun, painstakingly sweeping it across the night before\nhim, neither too fast nor too slowly. It affected the rushing followers\nof Lord Ghek exactly as if it had been an oversized meat-chopper. They\nwent down. Only three men remained in their saddles--they'd probably\nbeen sheltered by the bodies of men ahead. Hoddan attended to those\nthree with individual, personalized stun-pistol bolts--and immediately\nhad trouble with his men, who wanted to dismount and plunder their\nfallen enemies.\n\nHe wouldn't even let them collect the horses of the men now out of\naction. It would cost time, and Ghek wouldn't be losing any that he\ncould help. With a raging, trembling girl as prisoner, most men would\nwant to get her behind battlements as soon as possible. But Hoddan knew\nthat his party was slowed down by him. Presently he began to feel\nbitterly sure that Ghek would reach his castle before he was overtaken.\n\n\"This place he's heading for,\" he said discouragedly to Thal. \"Any\nchance of our rushing it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Thal dolefully. \"Ten men could hold it against a\nthousand!\"\n\n\"Then can't we make better time?\"\n\nThal said resignedly:\n\n\"Ghek probably had fresh horses waiting, so he could keep on at top\nspeed in his flight. I doubt we will catch him, now.\"\n\n\"The Lady Fani,\" said Hoddan bitterly, \"has put me in a fix so if I\ndon't fight him I'm ruined!\"\n\n\"Disgraced,\" corrected Thal. He said mournfully, \"It's the same thing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGloom descended on the whole party as it filled their leaders.\nInsensibly, the pace of the horses slackened still more. They had done\nwell. But a horse that can cover fifty miles a day at its own gait, can\nbe exhausted in ten or less, if pushed. By the time Hoddan and his men\nwere within two miles of Ghek's castle, their mounts were extremely\nreluctant to move faster than a walk. At a mile, they were kept in\nmotion only by kicks.\n\nThe route they followed was specific. There was no choice of routes,\nhere in the hills. They could only follow every twist and turn of the\ntrail, among steep mountain-flanks and minor peaks. But suddenly they\ncame to a clear wide valley, yellow cressets burned at its upper end, no\nmore than half a mile distant. They showed a castle gate, open, with the\nlast of a party of horsemen filing into it. Even as Hoddan swore, the\ngate closed. Faint shouts of triumph came from inside the castle walls\nto the completely frustrated pursuers without.\n\n\"I'd have bet on this,\" said Hoddan miserably. \"Stop here, Thal. Pick\nout a couple of your more hang-dog characters and fix them up with their\nhands apparently tied behind their backs. We take a breather for five\nminutes--no more.\"\n\nHe would not let any man dismount. He shifted himself about on his own\nsaddle, trying to find a comfortable way to sit. He failed. At the end\nof five minutes he gave orders. There were still shouts occasionally\nfrom within Ghek's castle. They had that unrhythmic frequency which\nsuggested that they were responses to a speech. Ghek was making a fine,\ndramatic spectacle of his capture of an unwilling bride. He was\naddressing his retainers and saying that through their fine loyalty,\nco-operation and willingness to risk all for their chieftain, they now\nhad the Lady Fani to be their chatelaine. He thanked them from the\nbottom of his heart and they were invited to the official wedding, which\nwould take place sometime tomorrow, most likely.\n\nBefore the speech was quite finished, however, Hoddan and his weary\nfollowing rode up into the patch of light cast by the cressets outside\nthe walls. Thal bellowed to the battlements.\n\n\"Prisoners!\" he roared, according to instructions from Hoddan. \"We\ncaught some prisoners in the ambush! They got fancy news! Tell Lord Ghek\nhe'd better get their story right off! No time to waste! Urgent!\"\n\nHoddan played the part of one prisoner, just in case anybody noticed\nfrom above that one man rode as if either entirely unskilled in riding\nor else injured in a fight.\n\nHe heard shoutings, over the walls. He glared at his men and they\ndrooped in their saddles. The gate creaked open and the horsemen from\nDon Loris' castle filed inside. They showed no elation, because Hoddan\nhad promised to ram a spear-shaft its full length down the throat of any\nman who gave away his stratagem ahead of time. The gate closed behind\nthem. Men appeared to take their horses. This could have revealed that\nthe newcomers were strangers, but Ghek would have recruited new and\nextra retainers for the emergency of tonight. There would be many\nstrange faces in his castle just now.\n\n\"Good fight, eh?\" bellowed an ancient, long-retired retainer with a wine\nbottle in his hand.\n\n\"Good fight!\" agreed Thal.\n\n\"Good plunder, eh?\" bellowed the ancient above the heads of younger men.\n\"Like the good old days?\"\n\n\"Better!\" boomed Thal.\n\nAt just this instant the young Lord Ghek appeared. There were scratches\non his cheek, acquired during the ride with Fani across his saddlebow.\nHe looked thrilled by his victory but uneasy about his prize.\n\n\"What's this about prisoners with fancy news?\" he demanded. \"What is\nit?\"\n\n\"Don Loris!\" whooped Thal. \"Long Live the Lady Fani!\"\n\nHoddan painstakingly opened fire; with the continuous-fire stud of this\npistol--his third tonight--pressed down. The merrymakers in the\ncourtyard wavered and went down in windrows. Thal opened fire with a\nstun-pistol. The others bellowed and began to fling bolts at every\nliving thing they saw.\n\n\"To the Lady Fani!\" rasped Hoddan, getting off his horse with as many\ncreakings as the castle gate.\n\nHis followers now rushed, dismounting where they had to. They fired with\nreckless abandon. A stun-pistol, which does not kill, imposes few\nrestraints upon its user. If you shoot somebody who doesn't need to be\nshot, he may not like it but he isn't permanently harmed. So the twelve\nwho'd followed Hoddan poured in what would have been a murderous fire if\nthey'd been shooting bullets, but was no worse than devastating as\nmatters stood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were screams and flight and utterly hopeless defiances by\nsword-armed and spear-armed men. In instants Hoddan went limping into\nthe castle with Thal by his side, searching for Fani. Ghek had not\nfallen at the first fire. He vanished, and the castle was plainly fallen\nand he made no attempt to lead resistance against its invaders. Hoddan's\nmen went raging happily through corridors and halls as they came to\nthem. They used their stun-pistols with zest and at such close quarters\nwith considerable effect. Hoddan heard Fani scream angrily and he and\nThal went swiftly to see. They came upon the young Lord Ghek trying to\nlet Fani down out of a window on a rope. He undoubtedly intended to\nfollow her and complete his abduction on the run. But Fani bit him, and\nHoddan said vexedly:\n\n\"Look here! It seems that I'm disgraced if I don't fight you somehow--\"\n\nThe young Lord Ghek rushed him, sword out, eyes blazing in a fine frenzy\nof despair. Hoddan brought him down with a buzz of the stun-gun.\n\nOne of Hoddan's followers came hunting for him.\n\n\"Sir,\" he sputtered, \"we got the garrison cornered in their quarters,\nand we've been picking them off through the windows, and they think\nthey're dropping dead and want to surrender. Shall we let 'em?\"\n\n\"By all means,\" Hoddan said irritably. \"And Thal, go get something\nheavier than a nightgown for the Lady Fani to wear, and then do what\nplundering is practical. But I want to be out of here in half an hour.\nUnderstand?\"\n\n\"I'll attend to the costume,\" said the Lady Fani vengefully. \"You cut\nhis throat while I'm getting dressed.\"\n\nShe nodded at the unconscious Lord Ghek on the pavement. She disappeared\nthrough a door nearby. Hoddan could guess that Ghek would have prepared\nsomething elaborate in the way of a trousseau for the bride he was to\ncarry screaming from her home. Somehow it was the sort of thing a\nDarthian would do. Now Fani would enjoyably attire herself in the best\nof it while--\n\n\"Thal,\" said Hoddan, \"help me get this character into a closet\nsomewhere. He's not to be killed. I don't like him, but at this moment I\ndon't like anybody very much, and I won't play favorites.\"\n\nThal dragged the insensible young nobleman into the next room. Hoddan\nlocked the door and pocketed the key as Fani came into view again. She\nwas splendidly attired, now, in brocade and jewels. Ghek had evidently\nhoped to placate her after marriage by things of that sort and had spent\nlavishly for them.\n\nNow, throughout the castle there were many and diverse noises.\nSometimes--not often--there was still the crackling hum of a\nstun-pistol. There were many more exuberant shoutings. They apparently\nhad to do with loot. There were some squealings in female voices, but\nmany more gigglings.\n\n\"I need not say,\" said the Lady Fani with dignity, \"that I thank you\nvery much. But I do say so.\"\n\n\"You're quite welcome,\" said Hoddan politely.\n\n\"And what are you going to do now?\"\n\n\"I imagine,\" said Hoddan, \"that we'll go down into the courtyard where\nour horses are. I gave my men half an hour to loot in. During that half\nhour I shall sit down on something which will, I hope, remain perfectly\nstill. And I may,\" he added morbidly, \"eat an apple. I've had nothing to\neat since I landed on Darth. People don't want to commit themselves to\nnot cutting my throat. But after half an hour we'll leave.\"\n\nThe Lady Fani looked sympathetic.\n\n\"But the castle's surrendered to you,\" she protested. \"You hold it!\nAren't you going to try to keep it?\"\n\n\"There are a good many unpleasant characters out yonder,\" said Hoddan,\nwaving his hand at the great outdoors, \"who've reason to dislike me very\nmuch. They'll be anxious to express their emotions, when they feel up to\nit. I want to dodge them. And presently the people in this castle will\nrealize that even stun-pistols can't keep on shooting indefinitely here.\nI don't want to be around when it occurs to them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe offered his arm with a reasonably grand air and went limping with her\ndown to the courtyard just inside the gate. Two of Don Loris' retainers\nstaggered into view as they arrived, piling up plunder which ranged from\na quarter keg of wine to a mass of frothy stuff which must be female\ngarments. They went away and other men arrived loaded down with their\nown accumulations of loot. Some of the local inhabitants looked on with\nuneasy indignation.\n\nHoddan found a bench and sat down. He conspicuously displayed one of the\nweapons which had captured the castle. Ghek's defeated retainers looked\nat him darkly.\n\n\"Bring me something to eat,\" commanded Hoddan. \"Then if you bring fresh\nhorses for my men, and one extra for each to carry his plunder on, I'll\ntake them away. I'll even throw in the Lord Ghek, who is now unharmed\nbut with his life in the balance. Otherwise--\"\n\nHe moved the pistol suggestively. The normal inhabitants of Ghek's\ncastle moved away, discussing the situation in subdued voices.\n\nThe Lady Fani sat down proudly on the bench beside him.\n\n\"You are wonderful!\" she said with conviction.\n\n\"I used to cherish that illusion myself,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"But nobody before in all Darthian history has ever fought twenty men,\nand then thirty men, and destroyed an ambush, and captured a castle, all\nin one day!\"\n\n\"And without a meal,\" said Hoddan darkly, \"and with a lot of blisters!\"\n\nHe considered. Somebody came running with bread and cheese and wine. He\nbit into the bread and cheese. After a moment he said, his mouth full:\n\n\"I once saw a man perform the unparalleled feat of jumping over nine\nbarrels placed in a row. It had never been done before. But I didn't\nenvy him. I never wanted to jump over nine barrels in a row! In the same\nway, I never especially wanted to fight other men or break up ambushes\nor capture castles. I want to do what I want to do, not what other\npeople happen to admire.\"\n\n\"Then what do you want to do?\" she asked admiringly.\n\n\"I'm not sure now,\" said Hoddan gloomily. He took a fresh bite. \"But a\nlittle while ago I wanted to do some interesting and useful things in\nelectronics, and get reasonably rich, and marry a delightful girl, and\nbecome a prominent citizen on Walden. I think I'll settle for another\nplanet, now.\"\n\n\"My father will make you rich,\" said the girl proudly. \"You saved me\nfrom being married to Ghek!\"\n\nHoddan shook his head.\n\n\"I've got my doubts,\" he said. \"He had a scheme to import a lot of\nstun-pistols and arm his retainers with them. Then he meant to rush the\nspaceport and have me set up a broadcast-power unit that'd keep them\ncharged all the time. Then he'd sit back and enjoy life. Holding the\nspaceport, nobody else could get stun-weapons, and nobody could resist\nhis retainers who had 'em. So he'd be top man on Darth. He'd have\nexactly as much power as he chose to seize. I think he cherished that\nlittle idea,--and I've given advance publicity to stun-pistols. Now he\nhasn't a ghost of a chance of pulling it off. I'm afraid he'll be\ndispleased with me.\"\n\n\"I can take care of that!\" said Fani confidently. She did not question\nthat her father would be displeased.\n\n\"Maybe you can,\" said Hoddan, \"but though he's kept a daughter he's lost\na dream. And that's bereavement! I know!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHorses came plodding into the courtyard with Ghek's retainers driving\nthem. They were anxious to get rid of their conquerors. Hoddan's men\ncame trickling back, with armsful of plunder to add to the piles they'd\npreviously gathered. Thal took charge, commanding the exchange of\nsaddles from tired to fresh horses and that the booty be packed on the\nextra mounts. It was time. Nine of the dozen looters were at work on the\ntask when there was a tumult back in the castle. Yellings and the clash\nof steel. Hoddan shook his head.\n\n\"Bad! Somebody's pistol went empty and the local boys found it out. Now\nwe'll have to fight some more--no.\"\n\nHe beckoned to a listening, tense, resentful inhabitant of the castle.\nHe held up the key of the room in which he'd locked young Ghek.\n\n\"Now open the castle gate,\" he commanded, \"and fetch out my last three\nmen, and we'll leave without setting fire to anything. The Lord Ghek\nwould like it that way. He's locked up in a room that's particularly\ninflammable.\"\n\nThe last statement was a guess, only, but Ghek's retainer looked\nhorrified. He bellowed. There was a subtle change in the bitterly\nhostile atmosphere. Men came angrily to help load the spare horses.\nHoddan's last three men came out of a corridor, wiping blood from\nvarious scratches and complaining plaintively that their pistols had\nshot empty and they'd had to defend themselves with knives.\n\nThree minutes later the cavalcade rode out of the castle gate and away\ninto the darkness. Hoddan had arrived here when Ghek was inside with\nFani as his prisoner, when there were only a dozen men without and at\nleast a hundred inside to defend the walls. And the castle was\nconsidered impregnable.\n\nIn half an hour Hoddan's followers had taken the castle, rescued Fani,\nlooted it superficially, gotten fresh horses for themselves and spare\nones for their plunder, and were headed away again. In only one respect\nwere they worse off than when they arrived. Some stun-pistols were\nempty.\n\nHoddan searched the sky and pieced together the star-pattern he'd noted\nbefore.\n\n\"Hold it!\" he said sharply to Thal. \"We don't go back the same way we\ncame! The gang that ambushed us will be stirring around again, and we\nhaven't got full stun-pistols now! We make a wide circle around those\ncharacters!\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Thal. \"There are only so many passes. The only other one\nis three times as long. And it is disgraceful to avoid a fight--\"\n\n\"Thal!\" snapped an icy voice from beside Hoddan, \"you have an order!\nObey it!\"\n\nEven in the darkness, Hoddan could see Thal jump.\n\n\"Yes, my Lady Fani,\" said Thal shakily. \"But we go a long distance\nroundabout.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe direction of motion through the night now changed. The long line of\nhorses moved in deepest darkness, lessened only by the light of many\nstars. Even so, in time one's eyes grew accustomed and it was a\nglamorous spectacle--twenty-eight beasts moving through dark defiles and\nover steep passes among the rugged, ragged hills. From any one spot they\nseemed at once to swagger and to slink, swaying as they moved on and\nvanished into obscurity. The small wild things in the night paused\naffrightedly in their scurryings until they had gone far away.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFani said in a soft voice:\n\n\"This is nice!\"\n\n\"What's nice about it?\" demanded Hoddan.\n\n\"Riding like this,\" said Fani enthusiastically, \"with men who have\nfought for me to guard me in the darkness, with the leader who has\nrescued me by my side, underneath the stars-- It's a delicious feeling!\"\n\n\"You're used to riding horseback,\" said Hoddan dourly.\n\nHe rode on, while mountains stabbed skyward and the pass they followed\nwound this way and that and he knew that it was a very roundabout way\nindeed. And he had unpleasing prospects to make it seem less\nsatisfying, even, than it would have been otherwise.\n\nBut they came, at last, to a narrow defile which opened out before them\nand there were no more mountains ahead, but only foothills. And there,\nfar and far away, they could see the sky as vaguely brighter. As they\nwent on, indeed, a glory of red and golden colorings appeared at the\nhorizon.\n\nAnd out of that magnificence three bright lights suddenly darted. In\nstrict V-formation, they flashed from the sunrise toward the west. They\nwent overhead, more brilliant than the brightest stars, and when partway\ndown to the horizon they suddenly winked out.\n\n\"What on Earth are they?\" demanded Fani. \"I never saw anything like that\nbefore!\"\n\n\"They're spaceships in orbit,\" said Hoddan. He was as astounded as the\ngirl, but for a different reason. \"I thought they'd be landed by now!\"\n\nIt changed everything. He could not see what the change amounted to, but\nchange there was. For one thing--\n\n\"We're going to the spaceport,\" he told Thal curtly. \"We'll recharge our\nstun-pistols there. I thought those ships had landed. They haven't. Now\nwe'll see if we can keep them aloft! How far to the landing grid?\"\n\n\"You insisted,\" complained Thal, \"that we not go back to Don Loris'\ncastle by the way we left it. There are only so many passes through the\nhills. The only other one is very long. We are only four miles--\"\n\n\"Then we head there right now!\" snapped Hoddan. \"And we step up the\nspeed!\"\n\nHe barked commands to his followers. Thal, puzzled but in dread of acid\ncomment from Fani, bustled up and down the line of men, insisting on a\nfaster pace. And the members of the cavalcade had not pushed these\nanimals as they had their first. Even the lead horses, loaded with loot,\nmanaged to get up to a respectable ambling trot. The sunrise proceeded.\nDew upon the straggly grass became visible. Separate drops appeared as\ngems upon the grass blades, and then began gradually to vanish as the\nsun's disk showed itself. Then the angular metal framework of the\nlanding grid rose dark against the sunrise sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen they rode up to it. Hoddan reflected that it was the only really\ncivilized structure on the planet. Architecturally it was surely the\nleast pleasing. It had been built when Darth was first settled on, and\nwhen ideas of commerce and interstellar trade seemed reasonable. It was\nhalf a mile high and built of massive metal beams. It loomed hugely\noverhead when the double file of shaggy horses trotted under its lower\narches and across the grass-grown space within it. Hoddan headed\npurposefully for the control shed. There was no sign of movement\nanywhere. The steeply gabled roofs of the nearby town showed only the\nfluttering of tiny birds. No smoke rose from chimneys. Yet the slanting\nmorning sunshine was bright.\n\nAs Hoddan actually reached the control shed, he saw a sleepy man in the\nact of putting a key in the door. He dismounted within feet of that man,\nwho turned and blinked sleepily at him, and then immediately looked the\nreverse of cordial. It was the red-headed man he'd stung with a\nstun-pistol the day before.\n\n\"I've come back,\" said Hoddan, \"for a few more kilowatts.\"\n\nThe red-headed man swore angrily.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Hoddan gently. \"The Lady Fani is with us.\"\n\nThe red-headed man jerked his head around and paled. Thal glowered at\nhim. Others of Don Loris' retainers shifted their positions\nsignificantly, to make their oversized belt-knives handier.\n\n\"We'll come in,\" said Hoddan. \"Thal, collect the pistols and bring them\ninside.\"\n\nFani swung lightly to the ground and followed him in. She looked\ncuriously at the cables and instrument boards and switches inside. On\none wall a red light pulsed, and went out, and pulsed again. The\nred-headed man looked at it.\n\n\"You're being called,\" said Hoddan. \"Don't answer it.\"\n\nThe red-headed man scowled. Thal came in with an armful of stun-pistols\nin various stages of discharge. Hoddan briskly broke the butt of one of\nhis own and presented it to the terminals he'd used the day before.\n\n\"He's not to touch anything, Thal,\" said Hoddan. To the red-headed man\nhe observed, \"I suspect that call's been coming in all night. Something\nwas in orbit at sundown. You closed up shop and went home early, eh?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" rasped the red-headed man. \"There's only one ship a month!\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Hoddan, \"there are specials. But I commend your\nnegligence. It was probably good for me.\"\n\nHe charged one pistol, and snapped its butt shut, and snapped open\nanother, and charged it. There was no difficulty, of course. In minutes\nall the pistols he'd brought from Walden were ready for use again.\n\nHe tucked away as many as he could conveniently carry on his person. He\nhanded the rest to Thal. He went competently to the pulsing call-signal.\nHe put headphones to his ears. He listened. His expression became\nextremely strange, as if he did not quite understand nor wholly believe\nwhat he heard.\n\n\"Odd,\" he said mildly. He considered for a moment or two. Then he\nrummaged around in the drawers of desks. He found wire clips. He began\nto snip wires in half.\n\nThe red-headed man started forward automatically.\n\n\"Take care of him, Thal,\" said Hoddan.\n\nHe cut the microwave receiver free of its wires and cables. He lifted it\nexperimentally and opened part of its case to make sure the thermo\nbattery that would power it in an emergency was there and in working\norder. It was.\n\n\"Put this on a horse, Thal,\" commanded Hoddan. \"We're taking it up to\nDon Loris'.\"\n\nThe red-headed man's mouth dropped open. He said stridently:\n\n\"Hey! You can't do that!\" Hoddan turned upon him and he said sourly:\n\"All right, you can. I'm not trying to stop you with all those hard\ncases outside!\"\n\n\"You can build another in a week,\" said Hoddan kindly. \"You must have\nspare parts.\"\n\nThal carried the communicator outside. Hoddan opened a cabinet, threw\nswitches, and painstakingly cut and snipped and snipped at a tangle of\nwires within.\n\n\"Just your instrumentation,\" he explained to the appalled red-headed\nman. \"You won't use the grid until you've got this fixed, too. A few\ndays of harder work than you're used to. That's all!\"\n\nHe led the way out again, and on the way explained to Fani:\n\n\"Pretty old-fashioned job, this grid. They make simpler ones nowadays.\nThey'll be able to repair it, though, in time. Now we go back to your\nfather's castle. He may not be pleased, but he should be mollified.\"\n\nHe saw Fani mount lightly into her own saddle and shook his head\ngloomily. He climbed clumsily into his own. They moved off to return to\nDon Loris' stronghold. Hoddan suffered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey reached the castle before noon, and the sight of the Lady Fani\nriding beside a worn-out Hoddan was productive of enthusiasm and loud\ncheers. The loot displayed by the returned wayfarers increased the\nrejoicing. There was envy among the men who had stayed behind. There\nwere respectfully admiring looks cast upon Hoddan. He had displayed, in\nfurnishing opportunities for plunder, the most-admired quality a leader\nof feudal fighting men could show.\n\nThe Lady Fani beamed as she and Thal and Hoddan, all very dusty and\ntravel-stained, presented themselves to her father in the castle's great\nhall.\n\n\"Here's your daughter, sir,\" said Hoddan, and yawned. \"I hope there\nwon't be any further trouble with Ghek. We took his castle and looted it\na little and brought back some extra horses. Then we went to the\nspaceport. I recharged my stun-pistols and put the landing grid out of\norder for the time being. I brought away the communicator there.\" He\nyawned again. \"There's something highly improper going on, up just\nbeyond atmosphere. There are three ships up there in orbit, and they\nwere trying to call the spaceport in nonregulation fashion, and it's\npossible that some of your neighbors would be interested. So I postponed\neverything until I could get some sleep. It seemed to me that when\nbetter skulduggeries are concocted, that Don Loris and his associates\nought to concoct them. And if you'll excuse me--\"\n\nHe moved away, practically dead on his feet. If he had been accustomed\nto horseback riding, he wouldn't have been so exhausted. But now he\nyawned, and yawned, and Thal took him to a room quite different from the\nguest-room-dungeon to which he'd been taken the night before. He noted\nthat the door, this time, opened inward. He braced chairs against it to\nmake sure that nobody could open it from without. He lay down and slept\nheavily.\n\nHe was waked by loud poundings. He roused himself enough to say\nsleepily:\n\n\"Whaddyawant?\"\n\n\"The lights in the sky!\" cried Fani's voice outside the door. \"The ones\nyou say are spaceships! It's sunset again, and I just saw them. But\nthere aren't three, now. Now there are nine!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Hoddan. He lay down his head again and thrust it into\nhis pillow. Then he was suddenly very wide awake indeed. He sat up with\na start.\n\nNine spaceships? That wasn't possible! That would be a space fleet! And\nthere were no space fleets! Walden would certainly have never sent more\nthan one ship to demand his surrender to its police. The Space Patrol\nnever needed more than one ship anywhere. Commerce wouldn't cause ships\nto travel in company. Piracy-- There couldn't be a pirate fleet! There'd\nnever be enough loot anywhere to keep it in operation. Nine spaceships\nat one time--traveling in orbit around a primitive planet like Darth--a\nfleet of spaceships.\n\nIt couldn't happen! Hoddan couldn't conceive of such a thing. But a\nrecently developed pessimism suggested that since everything else, to\ndate, had been to his disadvantage, this was probably a catastrophe\nalso.\n\nHe groaned and lay down to sleep again.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nWhen frantic bangings on the propped-shut door awakened him next\nmorning, he confusedly imagined that they were noises in the\ncommunicator headphones, and until he heard his name called tried\ndrearily to make sense of them.\n\nBut suddenly he opened his eyes. Somebody banged on the door once more.\nA voice cried angrily:\n\n\"Bron Hoddan! Wake up or I'll go away and let whatever happens to you\nhappen! Wake up!\"\n\nIt was the voice of the Lady Fani, at once indignant and tearful and\nsolicitous and angry.\n\nHe rolled out of bed and found himself dressed. He hadn't slept the full\nnight. At one time he couldn't rest for thinking about the sounds in the\ncommunicator when he listened at the spaceport. He listened again, and\nwhat he heard made him get his clothes on for action. That was when he\nheard a distinctly Waldenian voice, speaking communications speech with\ncrisp distinctness, calling the landing grid. The other voices were not\nWaldenian ones and he grew dizzy trying to figure them out. But he was\nclothed and ready to do whatever proved necessary when he realized that\nhe had the landing grid receiver, that there would be no reception even\nof the Waldenian call until the landing grid crew had built another out\nof spare parts in store, and even then couldn't do much until they'd\npainfully sorted out and re-spliced all the tangled wires that Hoddan\nhad cut. That had to be done before the grid could be used again.\n\nHe'd gone back to sleep while he tried to make sense of things. Now,\nlong after daybreak, he shook himself and made sure a stun-pistol was\nhandy. Then he said:\n\n\"Hello. I'm awake. What's up? Why all the noise?\"\n\n\"Come out of there!\" cried Fani's voice, simultaneously exasperated and\nfilled with anxiety. \"Things are happening! Somebody's here from Walden!\nThey want you!\"\n\nHoddan could not believe it. It was too unlikely. But he opened the door\nand Thal came in, and Fani followed.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Hoddan automatically.\n\nThal said mournfully:\n\n\"A bad morning, Bron Hoddan! A bad morning! Men from Walden came riding\nover the hills--\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Two,\" said Fani angrily. \"A fat man in a uniform, and a young man who\nlooks like he wants to cry. They had an escort of retainers from one of\nmy father's neighbors. They were stopped at the gate, of course, and\nthey sent a written message in to my father, and he had them brought\ninside right away!\"\n\nHoddan shook his head.\n\n\"They probably said that I'm a criminal and that I should be sent back\nto Walden. How'd they get down? The landing grid isn't working.\"\n\nFani said viciously:\n\n\"They landed in something that used rockets. It came down close to a\ncastle over that way--only six or seven miles from the spaceport. They\nasked for you. They said you'd have landed from the last liner from\nWalden. And because you and Thal fought so splendidly--why, everybody's\ntalking about you. So the chieftain over there accepted a present of\nmoney from them, and gave them horses as a return gift, and sent them\nhere with a guard. Thal talked to the guards. The men from Walden have\npromised huge gifts of money if they help take you back to the thing\nthat uses rockets.\"\n\n\"I suspect,\" said Hoddan, \"that it would be a spaceboat--a lifeboat.\nHm-m-m.... Yes. With a built-in tool-steel cell to keep me from telling\nanybody how to make--\" He stopped and grimaced. \"If they had time to\nbuild one in, that's certain! They'd take me to the spaceport in a\nsound-proofed can and I'd be hauled back to Walden in it. Fine!\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Fani anxiously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan's ideas were not clear. But Darth was not a healthy place for\nhim. It was extremely likely, for example, that Don Loris would feel\nthat the very bad jolt he'd given that astute schemer's plans, by using\nstun-pistols at the spaceport, had been neatly canceled out by his\nrescue of Fani. He would regard Hoddan with a mingled gratitude and\naversion that would amount to calm detachment. Don Loris could not be\ncounted on as a really warm personal friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the social system of Darth was not favorable to a\nstranger with an already lurid reputation for fighting, but whose\nweapons would be useless unless frequently recharged--and who couldn't\ncount on that as a steady thing.\n\nAs a practical matter, his best bet was probably to investigate the nine\ninexplicable ships overhead. They hadn't co-operated with the\nWaldenians. It could be inferred that no confidential relationship\nexisted up there. It was possible that the nine ships and the Waldenians\ndidn't even know of each other's presence. There is a lot of room in\nspace. If both called on ship-frequency and listened on ground-frequency,\nthey would not have picked up each others' summons to the ground.\n\n\"You've got to do something!\" insisted Fani. \"I saw Father talking to\nthem! He looked happy, and he never looks happy unless he's planning\nsome skulduggery!\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Hoddan, \"that I'll have some breakfast, if I may. As\nsoon as I fasten up my ship bag.\"\n\nThal said mournfully:\n\n\"If anything happens to you, something will happen to me too, because I\nhelped you.\"\n\n\"Breakfast first,\" said Hoddan. \"That, as I understand it, should make\nit disgraceful for your father to have my throat cut. But beyond that--\"\nHe said gloomily. \"Thal, get a couple of horses outside the wall. We may\nneed to ride somewhere. I'm very much afraid we will. But first I'd like\nto have some breakfast.\"\n\nFani said disappointedly:\n\n\"But aren't you going to face them? The men from Walden? You could shoot\nthem!\"\n\nHoddan shook his head.\n\n\"It wouldn't solve anything. Anyhow a practical man like your father\nwon't sell me out before he's sure I can't pay off better. I'll bet on a\nconference with me before he makes a deal.\"\n\nFani stamped her foot.\n\n\"Outrageous! Think what you saved me from!\"\n\nBut she did not question the possibility. Hoddan observed:\n\n\"A practical man can always make what he wants to do look like a noble\nsacrifice of personal inclinations to the welfare of the community. I've\ndecided that I've got to be practical myself, and that's one of the\nrules. How about breakfast?\"\n\nHe strapped the ship bag shut on the stun-pistols his pockets would not\nhold. He made a minor adjustment to the space communicator. It was not\nruined, but nobody else could use it without much labor finding out what\nhe'd done. This was the sort of thing his grandfather on Zan would have\nadvised. His grandfather's views were explicit.\n\n\"Helping one's neighbor,\" he'd said frequently in Hoddan's hearing while\nHoddan was a youth, \"is all right as a two-way job. But maybe he's\nlaying for you. You get a chance to fix him so he can't do you no harm\nand you're a lot better off and he's a hell of a lot better neighbor!\"\n\nThis was definitely true of the men from Walden. Hoddan guessed that\nDerec was one of them. The other would represent the police or the\nplanetary government. It was probably just as true of Don Loris and\nothers.\n\nHoddan found himself disapproving of the way the cosmos was designed.\nEven though presently he sat at breakfast high up on the battlements,\nand Fani looked at him with interesting anxiety, he was filled with\nforebodings. The future looked dark. Yet what he asked of fate and\nchance was so simple! He asked only a career and riches and a delightful\ngirl to marry and the admiration of his fellow-citizens. Trivial things!\nBut it looked like he'd have to do battle for even such minor gifts of\ndestiny!\n\nFani watched him breakfast.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" she complained. \"Anybody else would be proud\nof what he'd done and angry with my father. Or don't you think he'll act\nungratefully?\"\n\n\"Of course I do!\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"Then why aren't you angry?\"\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"And you take it for granted that I want to be properly grateful,\" said\nFani in one breath, \"and yet you haven't shown the least appreciation of\nmy getting two horses over in that patch of woodland yonder\"--she\npointed and Hoddan nodded--\"and having Thal there with orders to serve\nyou faithfully--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stopped short. Don Loris appeared, beaming, at the top of the steps\nleading here from the great hall where conferences took place. He\nregarded Hoddan benignly.\n\n\"This is a very bad business, my dear fellow,\" he said benevolently.\n\"Has Fani told you of the people who arrived from Walden in search of\nyou? They tell me terrible things about you!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hoddan. He prepared a roll for biting. He said: \"One of\nthem, I think, is named Derec. He's to identify me so good money isn't\nwasted paying for the wrong man. The other man's police, isn't he?\" He\nreflected a moment. \"If I were you, I'd start talking at a million\ncredits. You might get half that.\"\n\nHe bit into the roll as Don Loris looked shocked.\n\n\"Do you think,\" he asked indignantly, \"that I would give up the rescuer\nof my daughter to emissaries from a foreign planet, to be locked in a\ndungeon for life?\"\n\n\"Not in those words,\" conceded Hoddan. \"But after all, despite your deep\ngratitude to me, there are such things as one's duty to humanity as a\nwhole. And while it would cause you bitter anguish if someone dear to\nyou represented a danger to millions of innocent women and\nchildren--still, under such circumstances you might feel it necessary to\ndo violence to your own emotions.\"\n\nDon Loris looked at him with abrupt suspicion. Hoddan waved the roll.\n\n\"Moreover,\" he observed, \"gratitude for actions done on Darth does not\nentitle you to judge of my actions on Walden. While you might and even\nshould feel obliged to defend me in all things I have done on Darth,\nyour obligation to me does not let you deny that I may have acted less\ndefensibly on Walden.\"\n\nDon Loris looked extremely uneasy.\n\n\"I may have thought something like that,\" he admitted. \"But--\"\n\n\"So that,\" said Hoddan, \"while your debt to me cannot and should not be\noverlooked, nevertheless\"--Hoddan put the roll into his mouth and spoke\nless clearly--\"you feel that you should give consideration to the claims\nof Walden to inquire into my actions while there.\"\n\nHe chewed, and swallowed, and said gravely:\n\n\"And can I make deathrays?\"\n\nDon Loris brightened. He drew a deep breath of relief. He said\ncomplainingly:\n\n\"I don't see why you're so sarcastic! Yes. That is a rather important\nquestion. You see, on Walden they don't know how to. They say you do.\nThey're very anxious that nobody should be able to. But while in\nunscrupulous hands such an instrument of destruction would be most\nunfortunate ... ah ... under proper control--\"\n\n\"Yours,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"Say--ours,\" said Don Loris hopefully. \"With my experience of men and\naffairs, and my loyal and devoted retainers--\"\n\n\"And cozy dungeons,\" said Hoddan. He wiped his mouth. \"No.\"\n\nDon Loris started violently.\n\n\"No, what?\"\n\n\"No deathrays,\" said Hoddan. \"I can't make 'em. Nobody can. If they\ncould be made, some star somewhere would be turning them out, or some\nnatural phenomenon would let them loose from time to time. If there were\nsuch things as deathrays, all living things would have died, or else\nwould have adjusted to their weaker manifestations and developed\nimmunity so they wouldn't be deathrays any longer. As a matter of fact,\nthat's probably been the case, some time in the past. So far as the\ngadget goes that they're talking about, it's been in use for half a\ncentury in the Cetis cluster. Nobody's died of it yet.\"\n\nDon Loris looked bitterly disappointed.\n\n\"That's the truth?\" he asked unhappily. \"Honestly? That's your last word\non it?\"\n\n\"Much,\" said Hoddan, \"much as I hate to spoil the prospects of\nprofitable skulduggery, that's my last word and it's true.\"\n\n\"But those men from Walden are very anxious!\" protested Don Loris.\n\"There was no ship available, so their government got a liner that\nnormally wouldn't stop here to take an extra lifeboat aboard. It came\nout of overdrive in this solar system, let out the lifeboat, and went on\nits way again. Those two men are extremely anxious--\"\n\n\"Ambitious, maybe,\" said Hoddan. \"They're prepared to pay to overcome\nyour sense of gratitude to me. Naturally, you want all the traffic will\nbear. I think you can get half a million.\"\n\nDon Loris looked suspicious again.\n\n\"You don't seem worried,\" he said fretfully. \"I don't understand you!\"\n\n\"I have a secret,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"It will develop,\" said Hoddan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon Loris hesitated, essayed to speak, and thought better of it. He\nshrugged his shoulders and went slowly back to the flight of stone\nsteps. He descended. The Lady Fani started to wring her hands. Then she\nsaid hopefully:\n\n\"What's your secret?\"\n\n\"That your father thinks I have one,\" said Hoddan. \"Thanks for the\nbreakfast. Should I walk out the gate, or--\"\n\n\"It's closed,\" said the Lady Fani forlornly. \"But I have a rope for you.\nYou can go down over the wall.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Hoddan. \"It's been a pleasure to rescue you.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Will you--\" Fani hesitated. \"I've never known anybody like you before.\nWill you ever come back?\"\n\nHoddan shook his head at her.\n\n\"Once you asked me if I'd fight for you, and look what it got me into!\nNo commitments.\"\n\nHe glanced along the battlements. There was a fairly large coil of rope\nin view. He picked up his bag and went over to it. He checked the\nfastening of one end and tumbled the other over the wall.\n\nTen minutes later he trudged up to Thal, waiting in the nearby woodland\nwith two horses.\n\n\"The Lady Fani,\" he said, \"has the kind of brains I like. She pulled up\nthe rope again.\"\n\nThal did not comment. He watched morosely as Hoddan made the perpetually\npresent ship bag fast to his saddle and then distastefully climbed\naboard the horse.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Thal unhappily. \"I didn't make a\nparting-present to Don Loris, so I'll be disgraced if he finds out I\nhelped you. And I don't know where to take you.\"\n\n\"Where,\" asked Hoddan, \"did those characters from Walden come down?\"\n\nThal told him. At the castle of a considerable feudal chieftain, on the\nplain some four miles from the mountain range and six miles this side of\nthe spaceport.\n\n\"We ride there,\" said Hoddan. \"Liberty is said to be sweet, but the man\nwho said that didn't have blisters from a saddle. Let's go.\"\n\nThey rode away. There would be no immediate pursuit, and possibly none\nat all. Don Loris had left Hoddan at breakfast on the battlements. The\nLady Fani would make as much confusion over his disappearance as she\ncould. But there'd be no search for him until Don Loris had made his\ndeal.\n\nHoddan was sure that Fani's father would have an enjoyable morning. He\nwould relish the bargaining session. He'd explain in great detail how\nvaluable had been Hoddan's service to him, in rescuing Fani from an\nabductor who would have been an intolerable son-in-law. He'd grow almost\ntearful as he described his affection for Hoddan--how he loved his\ndaughter--as he observed grievedly that they were asking him to betray\nthe man who had saved for him the solace of his old age. He would\nmention also that the price they offered was an affront to his paternal\naffection and his dignity as prince of this, baron of that, lord of the\nother thing and claimant to the dukedom of something-or-other. Either\nthey'd come up or the deal was off!\n\nBut meanwhile Hoddan and Thal rode industriously toward the place from\nwhich those emissaries had come.\n\nAll was tranquil. All was calm. Once they saw a dust cloud, and Thal\nturned aside to a providential wooded copse, in which they remained\nwhile a cavalcade went by. Thal explained that it was a feudal chieftain\non his way to the spaceport town. It was simple discretion for them not\nto be observed, said Thal, because they had great reputations as\nfighting men. Whoever defeated them would become prominent at once. So\nsomebody might try to pick a quarrel under one of the finer points of\netiquette when it would be disgrace to use anything but standard\nDarthian implements for massacre. Hoddan admitted that he did not feel\nquarrelsome.\n\nThey rode on after a time, and in late afternoon the towers and\nbattlements of the castle they sought appeared. The ground here was only\ngently rolling. They approached it with caution, following the reverse\nslope of hills, and dry stream-beds, and at last penetrating horse-high\nbrush to the point where they could see it clearly.\n\nIf Hoddan had been a student of early terrestrial history, he might have\nremarked upon the re-emergence of ancient architectural forms to match\nthe revival of primitive social systems. As it was, he noted in this\nfeudal castle the use of bastions for flanking fire upon attackers, he\nrecognized the value of battlements for the protection of defenders\nwhile allowing them to shoot, and the tricky positioning of sally ports.\nHe even grasped the reason for the massive, stark, unornamented keep.\nBut his eyes did not stay on the castle for long. He saw the spaceboat\nin which Derec and his more authoritative companion had arrived.\n\nIt lay on the ground a half mile from the castle walls. It was a clumsy,\nobese, flattened shape some forty feet long and nearly fifteen wide. The\nground about it was scorched where it had descended upon its rocket\nflames. There were several horses tethered near it, and men who were\nplainly retainers of the nearby castle reposed in its shade.\n\nHoddan reined in.\n\n\"Here we part,\" he told Thal. \"When we first met I enabled you to pick\nthe pockets of a good many of your fellow-countrymen. I never asked for\nmy split of the take. I expect you to remember me with affection.\"\n\nThal clasped both of Hoddan's hands in his.\n\n\"If you ever return,\" he said with mournful warmth, \"I am your friend!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan nodded and rode out of the brushwood toward the spaceboat--the\nlifeboat--that had landed the emissaries from Walden. That it landed so\nclose to the spaceport, of course, was no accident. It was known on\nWalden that Hoddan had taken space passage to Darth. He'd have landed\nonly two days before his pursuers could reach the planet. And on a\nroadless, primitive world like Darth he couldn't have gotten far from\nthe spaceport. So his pursuers would have landed close by, also. But it\nmust have taken considerable courage. When the landing grid failed to\nanswer, it must have seemed likely that Hoddan's deathrays had been at\nwork.\n\nHere and now, though, there was no uneasiness. Hoddan rode heavily,\nwithout haste, through the slanting sunshine. He was seen from a\ndistance and watched without apprehension by the loafing guards about\nthe boat. He looked hot and thirsty. He was both. So the posted guard\nmerely looked at him without too much interest when he brought his dusty\nmount up to the shadow the lifeboat cast, and apparently decided that\nthere wasn't room to get into it.\n\nHe grunted a greeting and looked at them speculatively.\n\n\"Those two characters from Walden,\" he observed, \"sent me to get\nsomething from this thing, here. Don Loris told 'em I was a very honest\nman.\"\n\nHe painstakingly looked like a very honest man. After a moment there\nwere responsive grins.\n\n\"If there's anything missing when I start back,\" said Hoddan, \"I can't\nimagine how it happened! None of you would take anything. Oh, no! I bet\nyou'll blame it on me!\" He shook his head and said \"_Tsk. Tsk. Tsk._\"\n\nOne of the guards sat up and said appreciatively:\n\n\"But it's locked. Good.\"\n\n\"Being an honest man,\" said Hoddan amiably, \"they told me how to unlock\nit.\"\n\nHe got off his horse. He removed the bag from his saddle. He went into\nthe grateful shadow of the metal hull. He paused and mopped his face and\nthen went to the entrance port. He put his hand on the turning bar. Then\nhe painstakingly pushed in the locking-stud with his other hand. Of\ncourse the handle turned. The boat port opened. The two from Walden\nwould have thought everything safe because it was under guard. On Walden\nthat protection would have been enough. On Darth, the spaceboat had not\nbeen looted simply because locks, there, were not made with separate\nvibration-checks to keep vibration from loosening them. On spaceboats\nsuch a precaution was usual.\n\n\"Give me two minutes,\" said Hoddan over his shoulder. \"I have to get\nwhat they sent me for. After that everybody starts even.\"\n\nHe entered and closed the door behind him. Then he locked it. By the\nnature of things it is as needful to be able to lock a spaceboat from\nthe inside as it is unnecessary to lock it from without.\n\nHe looked things over. Standard equipment everywhere. He checked\neverything, even to the fuel supply. There were knockings on the port.\nHe continued to inspect. He turned on the visionscreens, which provided\nthe control room--indeed, all the boat--with an unobstructed view in all\ndirections. He was satisfied.\n\nThe knocks became bangings. Something approaching indignation could be\ndeduced. The guards around the spaceboat felt that Hoddan was taking an\nunfair amount of time to pick the cream of the loot inside.\n\nHe got a glass of water. It was excellent. A second.\n\nThe bangings became violent hammerings.\n\nHoddan seated himself leisurely in the pilot's seat and turned small\nknobs. He waited. He touched a button. There was a mildly thunderous\nbang outside, and the lifeboat reacted as if to a slight shock. The\nvisionscreens showed a cloud of dust at the spaceboat's stern, roused by\na deliberate explosion in the rocket tubes. It also showed the retainers\nin full flight.\n\nHe waited until they were in safety and made the standard take-off\npreparations. A horrific roaring started up outside. He touched controls\nand a monstrous weight pushed him back in his seat. The rocket swung,\nand lifted, and shot skyward with greater acceleration than before.\n\nIt went up at a lifeboat's full fall-like rate of climb, leaving a trail\nof blue-white flame behind it. All the surface of Darth seemed to\ncontract swiftly below him. The spaceport and the town rushed toward a\nspot beneath the spaceboat's tail. They shrank and shrank. He saw other\nplaces. Mountains. Castles. He saw Don Loris' stronghold. Higher, he saw\nthe sea.\n\nThe sky turned purple. It went black with specks of starshine in it.\nHoddan swung to a westward course and continued to rise, watching the\nstar-images as they shifted on the screens. The image of the sun, of\ncourse, was automatically diminished so that it was not dazzling. The\nrockets continued to roar, though in a minor fashion because there was\nno longer air outside in which a bellow could develop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan painstakingly made use of those rule-of-thumb methods of\nastrogation which his piratical forebears had developed and which a boy\non Zan absorbed without being aware. He wanted an orbit around Darth. He\ndidn't want to take time to try to compute it. So he watched the\nstar-images ahead and astern. If the stars ahead rose above the planet's\nedge faster than those behind sank down below it--he would be climbing.\nIf the stars behind sank down faster than those ahead rose up--he would\nbe descending. If all the stars rose equally he'd be climbing straight\nup, and if they all dropped equally he'd be moving straight down. It was\nnot a complex method, and it worked.\n\nPresently he relaxed. He sped swiftly back past midday and toward the\nsunrise line on Darth. This was the reverse of a normal orbit, but it\nwas the direction followed by the ships up here. He hoped his orbit was\nlower than theirs. If it was, he'd overtake them from behind. If he were\nhigher, they'd overtake him.\n\nHe turned on the space phone. Its reception-indicator was piously placed\nat \"Ground.\" He shifted it to \"Space,\" so that it would pick up calls\ngoing planetward, instead of listening vainly for replies from the\nnonoperative landing grid.\n\nInstantly voices boomed in his ears. Many voices. An impossibly large\nnumber of voices. Many, many, many more than nine transmitters were in\noperation now!\n\n\"_Idiot!_\" said a voice in quiet passion, \"_sheer off or you'll get in\nour drive-field!_\" A high-pitched voice said; \"_... And group two take\nsecond-orbit position--_\" Somebody bellowed: \"_But why don't they\nanswer?_\" And another voice still said formally: \"_Reporting group five,\nbut four ships are staying behind with tanker_ Toya, _which is having\nstabilizer trouble...._\"\n\nHoddan's eyes opened very wide. He turned down the sound while he tried\nto think. But there wasn't anything to think. He'd come aloft to scout\nthree ships that had turned to nine, because he was in such a fix on\nDarth that anything strange might be changed into something useful. But\nthis was more than nine ships--itself an impossibly large space fleet.\nThere was no reason why ships of space should ever travel together.\nThere were innumerable reasons why they shouldn't. There was a limit to\nthe number of ships that could be accommodated at any spaceport in the\ngalaxy. There was no point, no profit, no purpose in a number of ships\ntraveling together--\n\nDarth's sunrise-line appeared far ahead. The lifeboat would soon cease\nto be a bright light in the sky, now. The sun's image vanished from the\nrear screens. The boat went hurtling onward through the blackness of the\nplanet's shadow while voices squabbled, and wrangled, and formally\nreported, and now and again one admonished disputants to a proper\ndiscipline of language.\n\nDuring the period of darkness, Hoddan racked his brains for the vaguest\nof ideas on why so many ships should appear about an obscure and\nunimportant world like Darth. Presently the sunset line appeared ahead,\nand far away he saw moving lights which were the hulls of the volubly\ncommunicating vessels. He stared, blankly. There were tens-- Scores-- He\nwas forced to guess at the stark impossibility of more than a hundred\nspacecraft in view. As the boat rushed onward he had to raise the guess.\nIt couldn't be, but--\n\nHe turned on the outside telescope, and the image on its screen was more\nincredible than the voices and the existence of the fleet itself. The\nscope focused first on a bulging, monster, antiquated freighter of a\ndesign that had not been built for a hundred years. The second view was\nof a passenger liner with the elaborate ornamentation that in past\ngenerations was considered suitable for space. There was a bulk-cargo\nship, with no emergency rockets at all and crews' quarters in long\nblisters built outside the gigantic tank which was the ship itself.\nThere was a needle-sharp space yacht. More freighters, with streaks of\nrust on their sides where they had lain aground for tens of years....\n\nThe fleet was an anomaly, and each of its component parts was separately\na freak. It was a gathering-together of all the outmoded and obsolete\nhulks and monstrosities of space. One would have to scavenge half the\ngalaxy to bring together so many crazy, over-age derelicts that should\nhave been in junk yards.\n\nThen Hoddan drew an explosive deep breath. It was suddenly clear what\nthe fleet was and what its reason must be. Why it stopped here could not\nyet be guessed, but--\n\nHoddan watched absorbedly. He couldn't know what was toward, but there\nwas some emergency. It could be in the line of what an electronic\nengineer could handle. If so--why--it could mean an opportunity to\naccomplish great things, and grow rich, and probably marry some\ndelightful girl and be a great man somewhere--an assortment of ambitions\none could not easily gratify on Zan, or Walden, or Darth.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe spaceboat floated on upon a collision-course with the arriving\nfleet. That would not mean, of course, actual contact with any of the\nimprobable vessels themselves. Crowded as the sunlit specks might seem\nfrom Darth's night-side shadow, they were sufficiently separated. It was\nmore than likely that even with ten-mile intervals the ships would be\nconsidered much too crowded. But they came pouring out of emptiness to\ngo into a swirling, plainly pre-intended orbit about the planet from\nwhich Hoddan had risen less than an hour before.\n\nThere was inevitable confusion, though, and the spacephone proved it.\nThere were disputes between freakish ships when craft with the\nastrogational qualities of washtubs tried to keep assigned positions,\nand failed, and there were squabbles when ships had to pass close\ntogether. One had to shut off its drive-field to keep from blowing the\nfuses of both.\n\nBut there were some ships which proceeded quietly to their positions and\nothers which did the same after tumult amounting to rebellion. And\nnaturally there were a few others which seemed incapable of co-operation\nwith anybody. They went careening through the other ships' paths in what\nmust have seemed to the planet's sunset area like a most unlikely\ndancing of brand-new stars.\n\nIt was a gigantic traffic tangle, and Hoddan's boat drifted toward and\ninto it. He'd counted a hundred ships long before. His count now passed\ntwo hundred and continued. Before he gave up he'd numbered two hundred\nforty-seven space-oddities swarming to make a whirling band--a\nring--around the planet Darth.\n\nHe was fairly sure that he knew what they were, now. But he could not\npossibly guess where they came from. And most mysterious of all was the\nquestion of why they'd come out of faster-than-light drive to make of\nthemselves a celestial feature about a planet which had practically\nnothing to offer to anybody.\n\nPresently the spaceboat was in the very thick of the fleet. His\ncommunicator spouted voices whose tones ranged from basso profundo to\nhigh tenor, and whose ideas of proper astrogation seemed to vary more\nwidely still.\n\n\"_You there!_\" boomed a voice with deafening volume. \"_You're in our\nclear-space! Sheer off!_\"\n\nThe volume of a signal in space varies as the square of the distance.\nThis voice was thunderous. It came apparently from a nearby, pot-bellied\ntripper ship of really ancient vintage. Rows of ports in its sides had\nbeen welded over. It had rocket tubes whose size was indicative of the\nkind of long-obsolete fuel on which it once had operated. Slenderer\nnozzles peered out of the original ones now. It had been adapted to\nmodern propellants by simply welding modern rockets inside the old ones.\nIt was only half a mile away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan's spaceboat floated on. The relative position of the two ships\nchanged slowly. Another voice said indignantly:\n\n\"_That's the same thing that missed us by less than a mile! You, there!\nStop acting like a squig! Get on your own course!_\"\n\nA third voice;\n\n\"_What boat's that? I don't recognize it! I thought I knew all the\nfreaks in this fleet, too!_\"\n\nA fourth voice said sharply:\n\n\"_That's not one of us! Look at the design! That's not us!_\"\n\nOther voices broke in. There was babbling. Then a harsh voice roared:\n\n\"_Quiet! I order it!_\" There was silence. The harsh voice said heavily,\n\"_Relay the image to me._\" There was a pause. The same voice said\ngrimly: \"_It is not of our fleet. You, stranger! Identify yourself! Who\nare you and why do you slip secretly among us?_\"\n\nHoddan pushed the transmit button.\n\n\"My name is Bron Hoddan,\" he said. \"I came up to find out why three\nships, and then nine ships, went into orbit around Darth. It was\nsomewhat alarming. Our landing grid's disabled, anyhow, and it seemed\nwisest to look you over before we communicated and possibly told you\nsomething you might not believe. But you surely don't expect to land all\nthis fleet! Actually, we can't land any.\"\n\nThe harsh voice said as grimly as before:\n\n\"_You come from the planet below us? Darth? Why is your ship so small?\nThe smallest of ours is greater._\"\n\n\"This is a lifeboat,\" said Hoddan pleasantly. \"It's supposed to be\ncarried on larger ships in case of emergency.\"\n\n\"_If you will come to our leading ship_,\" said the voice, \"_we will\nanswer all your questions. I will have a smoke flare set off to guide\nyou._\"\n\nHoddan said to himself:\n\n\"No threats and no offers. I can guess why there are no threats. But\nthey should offer something!\"\n\nHe waited. There was a sudden huge eruption of vapor in space some two\nhundred miles away. Perhaps an ounce of explosive had been introduced\ninto a rocket tube and fired. The smoke particles, naturally ionized,\nadded their self-repulsion to the expansiveness of the explosive's\ngases. A cauliflowerlike shape of filmy whiteness appeared and grew\nlarger and thinner.\n\nHoddan drove toward the spot with very light touches of rocket power. He\nswung the boat around and killed its relative velocity. The leading ship\nwas a sort of gigantic, shapeless, utterly preposterous ark-like thing.\nHoddan could neither imagine a purpose for which it could have been\nused, nor a time when men would have built anything like it. Its huge\nsides seemed to be made exclusively of great doorways now tightly\nclosed.\n\nOne of those doorways suddenly gaped wide. It would have admitted a\ngood-sized modern ship. A nervous voice essayed to give Hoddan\ndirections for getting the spaceboat inside what was plainly an enormous\nhold now pumped empty of air. He grunted and made the attempt. It was\ntricky. He sweated when he cut off his power. But he felt fairly safe.\nRocket flames would burn down such a door, if necessary. He could work\nhavoc if hostilities began.\n\nThe great cargo door swung shut. The outside-pressure needle swung\nsharply and stopped at thirty centimeters of mercury pressure. There was\na clanging. A smaller door evidently opened somewhere. Lights came\non--old-fashioned glow tubes. Then figures appeared through a door\nleading to some other part of this ship.\n\nHoddan nodded to himself. The costume was odd. It was awkward. It was\neven primitive, but not in the fashion of the soiled but gaudily colored\ngarments of Darth. These men wore unrelieved black, with gray shirts.\nThere was no touch of color about them. Even the younger ones wore\nbeards. And of all unnecessary things, they wore flat-brimmed hats--in a\nspaceship!\n\nHoddan opened the boat door and said politely:\n\n\"Good morning. I'm Bron Hoddan. You were talking to me just now.\"\n\nThe oldest and most fiercely bearded of the men said harshly:\n\n\"I am the leader here. We are the people of Colin.\" He frowned when\nHoddan's expression remained unchanged. \"The people of Colin!\" he\nrepeated more loudly. \"The people whose forefathers settled that planet,\nand brought it to be a world of peace and plenty--and then foolishly\nwelcomed strangers to their midst!\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" said Hoddan. He knew what these people were doing, he\nbelieved, but putting a name to where they'd come from told him nothing\nof what they wanted of Darth.\n\n\"We made it a fair world,\" said the bearded man fiercely. \"But it was my\ngreat-grandfather who destroyed it. He believed that we should share it.\nIt was he who persuaded the Synod to allow strangers to settle among us,\nbelieving that they would become like us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan nodded expectantly. These people were in some sort of trouble or\nthey wouldn't have come out of overdrive. But they'd talked about it\nuntil it had become an emotionalized obsession that couldn't be\nsummarized. When they encountered a stranger, they had to picture their\npredicament passionately and at length.\n\nThis bearded man looked at Hoddan with burning eyes. When he went on, it\nwas with gestures as if he were making a speech, but it was a special\nsort of speech. The first sentence told what kind.\n\n\"They clung to their sins!\" said the bearded man bitterly. \"They did not\nadopt our ways! Our example went for naught! They brought others of\ntheir kind to Colin. After a little they laughed at us. In a little more\nthey outnumbered us! Then they ruled that the laws of our Synod should\nnot govern them. And they lured our young people to imitate\nthem--frivolous, sinful, riotous folk that they were!\"\n\nHoddan nodded again. There were elderly people on Zan who talked like\nthis. Not his grandfather! If you listened long enough they'd come to\nsome point or other, but they had arranged their thoughts so solidly\nthat any attempt to get quickly at their meaning would only produce\nconfusion.\n\n\"Twenty years since,\" said the bearded man with an angry gesture, \"we\nmade a bargain. We held a third of all the land of the planet, but our\nyoung men were falling away from the ways of their fathers. We made a\nbargain with the newcomers we had cherished. We would trade our lands,\nour cities, our farms, our highways, for ships to take us to a new world\nwith food for the journey and machines for the taming of the planet we\nwould select. We sent of our number to find a world to which we could\nmove. Ten years back, they returned. They had found it. The planet\nThetis.\"\n\nAgain Hoddan had no reaction. The name meant nothing.\n\n\"We began to prepare,\" said the old man, his eyes flashing. \"Five years\nsince, we were ready. But we had to wait three more before the\nbargainers were ready to complete the trade. They had to buy and collect\nthe ships. They had to design and build the machinery we would need.\nThey had to collect the food supplies. Two years ago we moved our\nanimals into the ships, and loaded our food and our furnishings, and\ntook our places. We set out. For two years we have journeyed toward\nThetis.\"\n\nHoddan felt an instinctive respect for people who would undertake to\nmove themselves, the third of the population of a planet, over a\ndistance that meant years of voyaging. They might have tastes in costume\nthat he did not share, and they might go in for elaborate oratory\ninstead of matter-of-fact statements, but they had courage.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hoddan. \"I take it this brings us up to the present.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the old man, his eyes flashing. \"Six months ago we considered\nthat we might well begin to train the operators of the machines we would\nuse on Thetis. We uncrated machines. We found ourselves cheated!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHoddan found that he could make a fairly dispassionate guess of what\nadvantage--say--Nedda's father would take of people who would not check\non his good faith for two years and until they were two years' journey\naway. The business men on Krim would have some sort of code determining\nhow completely one could swindle a customer. Don Loris, now--\n\n\"How badly were you cheated?\" asked Hoddan.\n\n\"Of our lives!\" said the angry old man. \"Do you know machinery?\"\n\n\"Some kinds,\" admitted Hoddan.\n\n\"Come,\" said the leader of the fleet.\n\nWith a sort of dignity that was theatrical only because he was aware of\nit, the leader of the people of Colin showed the way. Hoddan had been\nadmitted with his spaceboat into one gigantic cargo hold. He was now\nescorted to the next. It was packed tightly with cases of machinery. One\nhuge crate had been opened and its contents fully disclosed. Others had\nbeen hacked at enough to show their contents.\n\nThe uncrated machine was a jungle plow. It was a powerful piece of\nequipment which would attack jungle on a thirty-foot front, knock down\nall vegetation up to trees of four-foot diameter, shred it, loosen and\nsift the soil to a three-foot depth, and leave behind it smoothed,\nbroken, pulverized dirt mixed with ground-up vegetation ready to break\ndown into humus. Such a machine would clear tens of acres in a day and\nnight, turning jungle into farmland ready for terrestrial crops.\n\n\"We ran this for five minutes,\" said the bearded man fiercely as Hoddan\nnodded approval. He lifted a motor hood.\n\nThe motors were burned out. Worthless insulation. Gears were splintered\nand smashed. Low-grade metal castings. Assembly bolts had parted.\nTractor treads were bent and cracked. It was not a machine except in\nshape. It was a mock-up in worthless materials which probably cost its\nmaker the twentieth part of what an honest jungle plow would cost to\nbuild.\n\nHoddan felt the anger any man feels when he sees betrayal of that honor\na competent machine represents.\n\n\"It's not all like this!\" he said incredulously.\n\n\"Some is worse,\" said the old man, with dignity. \"There are crates which\nare marked to contain turbines. Their contents are ancient, worn-out\nbrick-making machines. There are crates marked to contain generators.\nThey are filled with corroded irrigation pipe and broken castings. We\nhave shiploads of crush-baled, rusted sheet-metal trimmings! We have\nbeen cheated of our lives!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan found himself sick with honest fury. The population of one-third\nof a planet, packed into spaceships for two years and more, would be\nappropriate subjects for sympathy at the best of times. But it was only\naccident that had kept these people from landing on Thetis by\nrocket--since none of their ships would be expected ever to rise\nagain--and from having their men go out and joyfully hack at an alien\njungle to make room for their machines to land--and then find out they'd\nbrought scrap metal for some thousands of light-years to no purpose.\n\nThey'd have starved outright. In fact, they were in not much better case\nright now. Because there was nowhere else that they could go! There was\nno new colony which could absorb so many people, with only their bare\nhands for equipment to live by. There was no civilized, settled world\nwhich could admit so many paupers without starving its own population.\nThere was nowhere for these people to go!\n\nHoddan's anger took on the feeling of guilt. He could do nothing, and\nsomething had to be done.\n\n\"Why ... why did you come to Darth?\" he asked. \"What can you gain by\norbiting here? You can't expect--\"\n\nThe old man faced him.\n\n\"We are beggars,\" he said with bitter dignity. \"We stopped here to ask\nfor charity--for the old and worn-out machines the people of Darth can\nspare us. We will be grateful for even a single rusty plow. Because we\nhave to go on. We can do nothing else. We will land on Thetis. And one\nplow can mean that a few of us will live who otherwise would die\nwith ... with the most of us.\"\n\nHoddan ran his hands through his hair. This was not his trouble, but he\ncould not thrust it from him.\n\n\"But again--why Darth?\" he asked helplessly. \"Why not stop at a world\nwith riches to spare? Darth's a poor place--\"\n\n\"Because it is the poor who are generous,\" said the bearded man evenly.\n\"The rich might give us what they could spare. But simple, not-rich\npeople, close to the soil, will give us what they need themselves. They\nwill share what they have, and accept a share of our need.\"\n\nHoddan paced up and down the ancient flooring of this compartment in an\nancient ship. Presently he said jerkily:\n\n\"With all the good will in the world.... Darth is poverty-stricken. It\nhas no industries. It has no technology. It has not even roads! It is a\nplanet of little villages and tiny towns. A ship from elsewhere stops\nhere only once a month. Ground communications are almost nonexistent. To\nspread the word of your need over Darth would require months. But to\ncollect what might be given, without roads or even wheeled vehicles-- No.\nIt's impossible! And I have the only space vessel on the planet, and\nit's not fit for a journey between suns.\"\n\nThe bearded man waited with a sort of implacable despair.\n\n\"But,\" said Hoddan grimly, \"I have an idea. I ... ah ... have contacts\non Walden. The government of Walden does not regard charity with favor.\nThe need for charity seems a ... ah ... a criticism of the Waldenian\nstandard of living.\"\n\nThe bearded man said coldly:\n\n\"I can understand that. The hearts of the rich are hardened. The\nexistence of the poor is a reproach to them.\"\n\nBut Hoddan began suddenly to see real possibilities. This was not a\ndirect move toward the realization of his personal ambitions. But on the\nother hand, it wasn't a movement away from them. Hoddan suddenly\nremembered an oration he'd heard his grandfather give many, many times\nin the past.\n\n\"Straight thinkin',\" the old man had said obstinately, \"is a delusion.\nYou think things out clear and simple, and you can see yourself ruined\nand your family starving any day! But real things ain't simple! They\nain't clear! Any time you try to figure things out so they're simple and\nstraightforward, you're goin' against nature and you're going to get 'em\nmixed up! So when something happens and you're in a straightforward,\nhopeless fix--why, you go along with nature! Make it as complicated as\nyou can, and the people who want you in trouble will get hopeless\nconfused and you can get out!\"\n\nHoddan adverted to his grandfather's wisdom--not making it the reason\nfor doing what he could, but accepting that it not impossibly might\napply. He saw one possibility right away. It looked fairly good. After a\nminute's examination it looked better. It was astonishing how\nplausible--\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" he said. \"I have planned work of my own, as you may have\nguessed. I am here because of ... ah ... people on Walden. If I could\nmake a quick trip to Walden my ... hm-m-m ... present position might let\nme help you. I cannot promise very much, but if I can borrow even the\nsmallest of your ships for the journey my spaceboat can't make ...\nwhy.... I may be able to do something. Much more than can be done on\nDarth!\"\n\nThe bearded man looked at his companions.\n\n\"He seems frank,\" he said forbiddingly, \"and we can lose nothing. We\nhave stopped our journey and are in orbit. We can wait. But ... our\npeople should not go to Walden. Fleshpots--\"\n\n\"I can find a crew,\" said Hoddan cheerfully. Inwardly he was\ntremendously relieved. \"If you say the word, I'll go down to ground and\ncome back with them. Er ... I'll want a very small ship!\"\n\n\"It will be,\" said the old man. \"We thank you--\"\n\n\"Get it inboard, here,\" suggested Hoddan, \"so I can come inside as\nbefore, transfer my crew without spacesuits, and leave my boat in your\ncare until I come back.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said the old man firmly. He added gravely: \"You must\nhave had an excellent upbringing, young man, to be willing to live among\nthe poverty-stricken people you describe, and to be willing to go so far\nto help strangers like ourselves.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Then Hoddan said enigmatically, \"What lessons I shall apply to\nyour affairs, I learned at the knee of my beloved grandfather.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf course, his grandfather was head of the most notorious gang of\npirates on the disreputable planet Zan, but Hoddan found himself\nincreasingly respecting the old gentleman as he gained experience of\nvarious worlds.\n\nHe went briskly back to his spaceboat. On the way he made verbal\narrangements for the enterprise he'd envisioned so swiftly. It was\nremarkable how two sets of troubles could provide suggestions for their\njoint alleviation. He actually saw possible achievement before him. Even\nin electronics!\n\nBy the time the cargo space was again pumped empty and the great door\nopened to the vastness of space, Hoddan had a very broad view of things.\nHe'd said that same day to Fani that a practical man can always make\nwhat he wants to do look like a sacrifice of his personal inclinations\nto others' welfare. He began to suspect, now, that the welfare of others\ncan often coincide with one's own.\n\nHe needed some rather extensive changes in the relationship of the\ncosmos to himself. Walden was prepared to pay bribes for him. Don Loris\nfelt it necessary to have him confined somewhere. There were a number of\nDarthian gentlemen who would assuredly like to slaughter him if he\nwasn't kept out of their reach in some cozy dungeon. But up to now\nthere had been not even a practical way to leave Darth, to act upon\nWalden, or even to change his status in the eyes of Darthians.\n\nHe backed out of the big ship and consulted the charts of the lifeboat.\nThey had been consulted before, of course, to locate the landing grid\nwhich did not answer calls. He found its position. He began to compare\nthe chart with what he saw from out here in orbit above Darth. He\nidentified a small ocean, with Darth's highest mountain chain just\nbeyond its eastern limit. He identified a river-system, emptying into\nthat sea. And here he began to get rid of his excess velocity, because\nthe landing grid was not very far distant--some fifteen hundred or two\nthousand miles.\n\nTo a scientific pilot, his maneuvering from that time on would have been\na complex task. The advantage of computation over astrogation by ear,\nhowever, is largely a matter of saving fuel. A perfectly computed course\nfor landing will get down to ground with the use of the least number of\ncentigrams of fuel possible. But fuel-efficient maneuvers are rarely\ntime-efficient ones.\n\nHoddan hadn't the time or the data for computation. He swung the\nspaceboat end for end, very judgmatically used rocket power to slow\nhimself to a suitable east-west velocity, and at the last and proper\ninstant applied full-power for deceleration and went down practically\nlike a stone. One cannot really learn this. It has to be absorbed\nthrough the pores of one's skin. That was the way Hoddan had absorbed\nit, on Zan.\n\nWithin minutes, then, the stronghold of Don Loris was startled by a\nroaring mutter in the sky high overhead. Helmeted sentries on the\nbattlements stared upward. The mutter rose to a howl, and the howl to\nthe volume of thunder, and the thunder to a very great noise which made\nloose pebbles dance and quiver.\n\nThen there was a speck of white cloudiness in the late afternoon sky. It\ngrew swiftly in size, and a winking blue-white light appeared in its\ncenter. That light grew brighter--and the noise managed somehow to\nincrease--and presently the ruddy sunlight was diluted by light from the\nrockets with considerably more blue in it. Secondary, pallid shadows\nappeared.\n\nThen, abruptly, the rockets cut off, and something dark plunged\ndownward, and the rockets flamed again, and a vast mass of steam arose\nfrom scorched ground--and the spaceboat lay in a circle of wildly\nsmoking, carbonized Darthian soil. The return of tranquility after so\nmuch of tumult was startling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbsolutely nothing happened. Hoddan unstrapped himself from the pilot's\nseat, examined his surroundings thoughtfully, and turned off the vision\napparatus. He went back and examined the feeding arrangements of the\nboat. He'd had nothing to eat since breakfast in this same time-zone.\nThe food in store was extremely easy to prepare and not especially\nappetizing. He ate with great deliberation, continuing to make plans\nwhich linked the necessities of the emigrants from Colin to his\nrelationship to the government of Walden, the brief visit he'd made to\nKrim, the ship the emigrants would lend him and his unpopularity with\nDon Loris on Darth. He also thought very respectfully about his\ngrandfather's opinions on many subjects, including space-piracy. Hoddan\nfound himself much more in agreement with his grandfather than he'd\nbelieved possible.\n\nOutside the boat, birds which had dived to ground and cowered there\nduring the boat's descent now flew about again, their terror forgotten.\nHorses which had galloped wildly in their pastures, or kicked in panic\nin the castle stalls, returned to their oats and hay.\n\nAnd there were human reactions. Don Loris had been in an excessively\nfretful state of mind since the conclusion of his deal with the pair\nfrom Walden. Hoddan had estimated that he ought to get a half-million\ncredits for Hoddan delivered to Derec and the Waldenian police. He'd\nbeen unable to get the police official--Derec merely sat miserably by\nand said nothing--to promise more than half so much. But he'd closed the\ndeal and sent for Hoddan--and Hoddan was gone.\n\nNow the landing of this spaceboat roused a lively uneasiness in Don\nLoris. It might be new bargainers for Hoddan. It might be anything.\nHoddan had said he had a secret. This might be it. Don Loris vexedly\ntried to contrive some useful skulduggery without the information to\nbase it on.\n\nFani looked at the spaceboat with bright eyes. Thal was back at the\ncastle. He'd told her of Hoddan riding up to the spaceboat near another\nchieftain's castle, entering it, and that then it had taken to the skies\nin an aura of flames and smoke and thunder. Fani hoped that he might\nhave returned here in it. But she worried while she waited for him to do\nsomething.\n\nHoddan did nothing. The spaceboat gave no sign of life.\n\nThe sun set, and the sky twinkled with darting lights which flew toward\nthe west and vanished. Twilight followed, and more lights flashed across\nthe heavens as if pursuing the sun. Fani had learned to associate three\nand then nine such lights with spacecraft, but she could not dream of a\nfleet of hundreds. She dismissed the lights from her mind, being much\nmore concerned with Hoddan. He would be in as bad a fix as ever if he\ncame out of the boat.\n\nTwilight remained, a fairy half-light in which all things looked much\nmore charming than they really were. And Don Loris, reduced to peevish\nsputtering by pure mystery, summoned Thal to him. It should be\nremembered that Don Loris knew nothing of the disappearance of the\nspaceboat from his neighbor's land. He knew nothing of Thal's journey\nwith Hoddan. But he did remember that Hoddan had seemed unworried at\nbreakfast and explained his calm by saying that he had a secret. The\nfeudal chieftain worried lest this spaceboat be it.\n\n\"Thal,\" said Don Loris peevishly, sitting beside the great fireplace in\nthe enormous, draughty hall, \"you know this Bron Hoddan better than\nanybody else.\"\n\nThal breathed heavily. He turned pale.\n\n\"Where is he?\" demanded Don Loris.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Thal. It was true. So far as he was concerned,\nHoddan had vanished into the sky.\n\n\"What does he plan to do?\" demanded Don Loris.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Thal helplessly.\n\n\"Where does that ... that thing outside the castle come from?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Thal.\n\nDon Loris drummed on the arm of his intricately carved chair.\n\n\"I don't like people who don't know things!\" he said fretfully. \"There\nmust be somebody in that--thing. Why don't they show themselves? What\nare they here for? Why did they come down--especially here? Because of\nBron Hoddan?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Thal humbly.\n\n\"Then go find out!\" snapped Don Loris. \"Take a reasonable guard with\nyou. The thing must have a door. Knock on it and ask who's inside and\nwhy they came here. Tell them I sent you to ask.\"\n\nThal saluted. With his teeth tending to chatter, he gathered a\nhalf-dozen of his fellows and went tramping out the castle gate. Some of\nthe half dozen had been involved in the rescue of the Lady Fani from\nGhek. They were still in a happy mood because of the plunder they'd\nbrought back. It was much more than a mere retainer could usually hope\nfor in a year.\n\n\"What's this all about, Thal?\" demanded one of them as Thal arranged\nthem in two lines to make a proper military appearance, spears dressed\nupright and garrison-shields on their left arms.\n\n\"Frrrrd _harch!_\" barked Thal, and they swung into motion. \"Two, three,\nfour, _Hup_, two, three, four. _Hup_, two, three--\" The cadence was\nestablished.\n\nThal said gloomily, \"Don Loris said to find out who landed that thing\nout yonder. And he keeps asking me about Bron Hoddan, too.\"\n\nHe strode in step with the others. The seven men made an impressively\nsoldierly group, tramping away from the castle wall.\n\n\"What happened to him?\" asked a rear-file man. He marched on, eyes\nfront, chest out, spear-shaft swinging splendidly in time with his\nmarching. \"That lad has a nose for loot! Don't take it himself, though.\nIf he set up in business as a chieftain, now--\"\n\n\"_Hup_, two, three, four,\" muttered Thal. \"_Hup_, two, three--\"\n\n\"Don Loris' a hard chieftain,\" growled the right-hand man in the second\nfile. \"Plenty of grub and beer, but no fighting and no loot. I didn't\nget to go with you characters the other day, but what you brought\nback--\"\n\n\"Wasn't half of what was there,\" mourned a front-file man. \"Wasn't half!\nThose pistols he issued got shot out and we had to get outta there\nfast!... Hm-m-m.... Here's this thing, Thal. What do we do with it?\"\n\n\"Hrrrmp, _halt!_\" barked Thal. He stared at the motionless, seemingly\nlifeless, shapeless spaceboat. He'd seen one like it earlier today. That\none spouted fire and went up out of sight. He was wary of this one. He\ngrumbled: \"Those pipes in the back of it--steer clear of 'em. They spit\nfire. No door on this side. Don Loris said knock on the door. We go\naround the front. Frrrrd _harch!_ two, three, four, _hup_, two, three,\nfour. Left turn here and mind those rocks. Don Loris'd give us hell if\nsomebody fell down. Left turn again, _Hup_, two, three, four--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe seven men tramped splendidly around the front of the lifeboat. On\nthe far side, its bulk hid even Don Loris' castle from view. The six\nspearmen, with Thal, came to a second halt.\n\n\"Here goes,\" rumbled Thal. \"I tell you, boys, if she starts to spit\nfire, you get the hell away!\"\n\nHe marched up to the spaceboat's port. He knocked on it. There was no\nresponse. He knocked again.\n\nHoddan opened the door. He nodded cheerfully to Thal.\n\n\"'Afternoon, Thal! Glad to see you. I've been hoping you'd come over\nthis way. Who's with you?\" He peered through the semidarkness. \"Some of\nthe boys, eh? Come in!\" He beckoned and said casually: \"Lean your spears\nagainst the hull, there.\"\n\nThal hesitated and was lost. The others obeyed. There were clatterings\nas the steel spearheads came to rest against the metal hull. Six of Don\nLoris' retainers followed Thal admiringly into the spaceboat's interior,\nto gaze at it and that Bron Hoddan who so recently had given three of\nthem and nearly half a score of their fellows the chance to loot a\nnearby castle.\n\n\"Sit down!\" said Hoddan cordially. \"If you want to feel what a\nspaceboat's really like, clasp the seat belts around you. You'll feel\nexactly like you're about to make a journey out of atmosphere. That's\nit. Lean back. You notice there are no viewports in the hull? That's\nbecause we use these visionscreens to see around with.\"\n\nHe flicked on the screens. Thal and his companions were charmed to see\nthe landscape outside portrayed on screens. Hoddan shifted the\nsensitivity-point toward infra red, and details came out that would have\nbeen invisible to the naked eye.\n\n\"With the boatport closed,\" said Hoddan, \"like this--\" The port clanged\nshut and grumbled for half a second as the locking-dogs went home.\n\"We're all set for take-off. I need only get into the pilot's seat\"--he\ndid so, \"and throw on the fuel pump--\" A tiny humming sounded. \"And we\nmove when I advance this throttle!\"\n\nHe pressed the firing-stud. There was a soul-shaking roar. There was a\nterrific pressure. The seven men from Don Loris' stronghold were pressed\nback in their seats with an overwhelming, irresistible pressure which\nheld them absolutely helpless. Their mouths dropped open. Appalled\nprotests tried to come out, but were pushed back by the seemingly\never-increasing acceleration.\n\nThe screens, showing the outside, displayed a great and confused tumult\nof smoke and fumes and dust to rearward. They showed only stars ahead.\nThose stars grew brighter and brighter, as the roar of the rockets\ndiminished to a merely deafening sound. Suddenly the disk of the local\nsun appeared, rising above the horizon to the west. The spaceboat,\nnaturally, overtook it as it rose into an orbit headed east to west\ninstead of the other way about.\n\nPresently Hoddan turned off the fuel pump. He turned to look\nthoughtfully at the seven men. They were very pale. They sat unanimously\nvery still, because they could see in the vision plates that a strange,\nmottled, again-sunlit surface flowed past them with an appalling\nvelocity. They were very much afraid that they knew what it was. They\ndid. It was the surface of the planet Darth, well below them.\n\n\"I'm glad you boys came along,\" said Hoddan. \"We'll catch up with the\nfleet in a moment or two. The pirate fleet, you know! I'm very pleased\nwith you. Not many groundlings would volunteer for space-piracy, not\neven with the loot there is in it!\"\n\nThal choked slightly, but no one else made a sound. No one even\nprotested. Protests would have been no use. There were looks of anguish,\nbut nothing else, because Hoddan was the only one in the spaceboat who\nhad the least idea of how to get it down again. His passengers had to go\nalong for the ride he'd taken them for, no matter where it led.\n\nNumbly, they waited for what would befall.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nHoddan did not worry about his followers--captives--noting the\nobsolescence of the space fleet into which they presently drifted.\nAncient hulks and impractical oddities did not seem antique or freakish\nto them. They had no standards in such matters. The planet Darth seemed\nslightly off to one side in space, at some times, and at others it\nseemed underfoot while at others it looked directly overhead. At all\ntimes it moved visibly, while the spaceboat and the ships in orbit\nseemed merely to float in nearly fixed positions. When the dark part of\nDarth appeared to roll toward the spaceboat again all the bright specks\nwhich were ships about them winked out of sight and there were only\nfaraway stars and a vast blackness off to one side like nothingness made\nvisible.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe spearmen were wholly subdued when there was light once more and\neccentric shapes around them. There was a ring-ship--the hull like a\nmetal wheel with a huge tire, with pipe passages from the tire part to\nthe hub where the control room was located. It seemed unbelievable that\nsuch a relic could still exist, dating as it did from the period before\ngravity-fields could be put into spacecraft. It would have provided a\ncrazy sort of gravity by spinning as it limped from one place to\nanother. Whoever had collected this fleet for the emigrants from Colin\nmust have required only one thing--that there be a hull. Given something\nthat would hold air, a Lawlor drive, a gravity-unit, and air apparatus\nwould turn it into a ship that could go into overdrive and hence cross\nthe galaxy at need. Those who bargained with the emigrants had been\ncontent to furnish nothing more than that.\n\nBut this could not be appreciated by Hoddan's involuntary crew. The\nspaceboat drew up alongside the gigantic hulk which was the leader's.\nThe seven Darthians were still numbed by their kidnaping and the\nsituation in which they found themselves. They looked with dull eyes at\nthe mountainous object they approached. It had actually been designed as\na fighter-carrier of space, intended to carry smaller craft to fight\nnonexistent warships under conditions which never came about. It must\nhave been sold for scrap a couple of hundred years since, and patched up\nfor this emigration.\n\nHoddan waited for the huge door to open. It did. He headed into the\nopening, noticing as he did so that an object two or three times the\nsize of the spaceboat was already there. It cut down the room for\nmaneuvering, but a thing once done is easier thereafter. Hoddan got the\nboat inside, and there was a very small scraping and the great door\nclosed before the boat could drift out again.\n\nHoddan turned to his companions--followers--victims, once the spaceboat\nwas still.\n\n\"This,\" he said in a manner which could only be described as one of\nsmiling ferocity, \"is a pirate ship, belonging to the pirate fleet we\npassed through on the way here. It's manned by characters so murderous\nthat their leaders don't dare land anywhere away from their home\nstar-cluster, or all the galaxy would combine against them, to\nexterminate them or be exterminated. You've joined that fleet. You're\ngoing to get out of this boat and march over that ship yonder. Then\nyou're going to be space pirates under me.\"\n\nThey quivered, but did not protest.\n\n\"I'll try you for one voyage,\" he told them. \"There will be plunder.\nThere will be pirate revels. If you serve faithfully and fight well,\nI'll return you to Don Loris' stronghold with your loot after the one\nvoyage. If you don't--\" He grinned mirthlessly at them--\"out the air\nlock with you, to float forever between the stars. Understand?\"\n\nThe last was pure savagery. They cringed. The outside-pressure meter\nwent up to normal. Hoddan turned off the visionscreens, so ending any\nview of the interior of the hold. He opened the port and went out.\nSitting in something like continued paralysis in their seats, the seven\nspearmen of Darth heard his voice in conversation outside the boat. They\ncould catch no words, but Hoddan's tone was strictly businesslike. He\ncame back.\n\n\"All right,\" he said shortly. \"Thal, march 'em over.\"\n\nThal gulped. He loosened his seat belt. The enlistment of the seven in\nthe pirate fleet was tacitly acknowledged. They were unarmed save for\nthe conventional large knives at their belts.\n\n\"Frrrd, _harch!_\" rasped Thal with a lump in his throat. \"Two, three,\nfour. _Hup_ two, three, four. _Hup_--\"\n\nSeven men marched dismally out of the spaceboat and down to the floor of\nthe huge hold. Eyes front, chests out, throats dry, they marched to the\nlarger but still small vessel that shared this hold compartment. They\nmarched into that ship. Thal barked, \"_Halt!_\" and they stopped. They\nwaited.\n\nHoddan came in very matter-of-factly only moments later. He closed the\nentrance port, so sealing the ship. He nodded approvingly.\n\n\"You can break ranks now,\" he said. \"There's food and such stuff around.\nThe ship's yours. But don't turn knobs or push buttons until you've\nasked me what for!\"\n\nHe went forward, and a door closed behind him.\n\nHe looked at the control board, and could have done with a little\ninformation himself. When the ship was built, generations ago, there'd\nbeen controls installed which would be quite useless now. When the\npresent working instruments were installed, it had been done so hastily\nthat the wires and relays behind them were not concealed, and it was\nthese that gave him the clues to understand them.\n\nThe space ark's door opened. Hoddan backed his ship out. Its rockets had\nsurprising power. He reflected that the Lawlor drive wouldn't have been\ndesigned for this present ship, either. There'd probably been a quantity\norder for so many Lawlor drives, and they'd been installed on whatever\nneeded a modern drive-system, which was every ship in the fleet. But\nsince this was one of the smallest craft in the lot, with its low mass\nit should be fast.\n\n\"We'll see,\" he said to nobody in particular.\n\nOut in emptiness, but naturally sharing the orbit of the ship from which\nit had just come, Hoddan tried it out tentatively. He got the feel of\nit. Then as a matter of simple, rule-of-thumb astrogation, he got from a\nlow orbit to a five-diameter height where the Lawlor drive would take\nhold by mere touches of rocket power. It was simply a matter of\nstretching the orbit to extreme eccentricity as all the ships went round\nthe planet. After the fourth go round he was fully five diameters out at\naphelion. He touched the Lawlor drive button and everybody had that very\npeculiar disturbance of all their senses which accompanies going into\noverdrive. The small craft sped through emptiness at a high multiple of\nthe speed of light.\n\nHoddan's knowledge of astrogation was strictly practical. He went over\nhis ship. From a look at it outside he'd guessed that it once had been a\nyacht. Various touches inside verified that idea. There were two\nstaterooms. All the hull-space was for living and supplies. None was for\ncargo. He nodded. There was a faint mustiness about it. But there'd been\na time when it was some rich man's pride.\n\nHe went back to the control room to make an estimate. From the pilot's\nseat one could see a speck of brightness directly ahead. Infinitesimal\ndots of brightness appeared, grew swiftly brighter and then darted\noutward. As they darted they disappeared because their motion became too\nswift to follow. There were, of course, methods of measuring this\nphenomenon so that one could get an accurate measure of one's speed in\noverdrive. Hoddan had no instrument for the purpose. But he had the\nfeel of things. This was a very fast ship indeed, at full Lawlor thrust.\n\nPresently he went out to the central cabin. His followers had found\nprovisions. There were novelties--hydroponic fruit, for instance--and\nthey'd gloomily stuffed themselves. They were almost resigned, now.\nMemory of the loot he'd led other men to at Ghek's castle inclined them\nto be hopeful. But they looked uneasy when he stopped where they were\ngathered.\n\n\"Well?\" he said sharply.\n\nThal swallowed.\n\n\"We have been companions, Bron Hoddan,\" he said unhappily. \"We fought\ntogether in great battles, two against fifty, and we plundered the\nslain.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" agreed Hoddan. If Thal wanted to edit his memories of the\nfighting at the spaceport, that was all right with him. \"Now we're\nheaded for something much better.\"\n\n\"But what?\" asked Thal miserably. \"Here we are high above our native\nworld--\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Hoddan. \"You couldn't even pick out its sun, from where\nwe are now!\"\n\nThal gulped.\n\n\"I ... do not understand what you want with us,\" he protested. \"We are\nnot experienced in space! We are simple men--\"\n\n\"You're pirates now,\" Hoddan told him with a sort of genial\nbloodthirstiness. \"You'll do what I tell you until we fight. Then you'll\nfight well or die. That's all you need to know!\"\n\nHe left them. When men are to be led it is rarely wise to discuss policy\nor tactics with them. Most men work best when they know only what is\nexpected of them. Then they can't get confused and they do not get ideas\nof how to do things better.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan inspected the yacht more carefully. There were still traces of\ndecorative features which had nothing to do with space-worthiness. But\nthe mere antiquity of the ship made Hoddan hunt more carefully. He found\na small compartment packed solidly with supplies. A supply-cabinet did\nnot belong where it was. He hauled out stuff to make sure. It was ... it\nhad been ... a machine shop in miniature. In the early days, before\nspacephones were long-range devices, a yacht or a ship that went beyond\norbital distance was strictly on its own. If there were a breakdown, it\nwas strictly private. It had to repair itself or else. So all early\nspacecraft carried amazingly complete equipment for repairs. Only liners\nare equipped that way in recent generations, and it is almost unheard-of\nfor their tool shops to be used.\n\nBut there was the remnant of a shop on the yacht that Hoddan had in hand\nfor his errand to Walden. He'd told the emigrant leaders that he went to\nask for charity. He'd just assured his followers that their journey was\nfor piracy. Now--\n\nHe began to empty the cubbyhole of all the items that had been packed\ninto it for storage. It had been very ingenious, this miniature repair\nshop. The lathe was built in with strength-members of the walls as part\nof its structure. The drill press was recessed. The welding apparatus\nhad its coils and condensers under the floor. The briefest of\nexaminations showed the condensers to be in bad shape, and the coils\nmight be hopeless. But there was good material used in the old days.\nHoddan began to have quite unreasonable hopes.\n\nHe went back to the control room to meditate.\n\nHe'd had a reasonably sound plan of action for the pirating of a\nspace-liner, even though he had no weapons mounted on the ship nor\nanything more deadly than stun-pistols for his reluctant crew. But he\nconsidered it likely that he could make the same sort of landing with\nthis yacht that he'd already done with the spaceboat. Which should be\nenough.\n\nIf he waited off Walden until a liner went down to the planet's great\nspaceport, he could try it. He would go into a close orbit around Walden\nwhich would bring him, very low, over the landing grid within an hour or\nso of the liner's landing. He'd turn the yacht end for end and apply\nfull rocket power for deceleration. The yacht would drop like a stone\ninto the landing grid. Everything would happen too quickly for the grid\ncrew to think of clapping a force field on it, or for them to manage it\nif they tried. He'd be aground before they realized it.\n\nThe rest was simply fast action. Hoddan and seven Darthians,\nstun-pistols humming, would tumble out of the yacht and dash for the\ncontrol room of the grid. Hoddan would smash the controls. Then they'd\nrush the landed liner, seize it, shoot down anybody who tried to oppose\nthem, and seal up the ship.\n\nAnd then they'd take off. On the liner's rockets, which were carried for\nemergency landing only, but could be used for a single take-off. After\none such use they'd be exhausted. And with the grid's controls smashed,\nnobody could even try to stop them.\n\nIt wasn't a bad idea. He had a good deal of confidence in it. It was the\nreason for his Darthian crew. Nobody'd expect such a thing to be tried,\nso it almost certainly could be done. But it did have the drawback that\nthe yacht would have to be left behind, a dead loss, when the liner was\nseized.\n\nHoddan thought it over soberly. Long before he reached Walden, of\ncourse, he could have his own crew so terrified that they'd fight like\nfiends for fear of what he might do to them if they didn't. But if he\ncould keep the space-yacht also--\n\nHe nodded gravely. He liked the new possibility. If it didn't work,\nthere was the first plan in reserve. In any case he'd get a modern\nspace-liner and a suitable cargo to present to the emigrants of Colin.\nAnd afterward--\n\nThere were certain electronic circuits which were akin. The Lawlor\ndrive unit formed a force field, a stress in space, into which a nearby\nship necessarily moved. The faster-than-light angle came from the fact\nthat it worked like a donkey trotting after a carrot held in front of\nhim by a stick. The ship moving into the stressed area moved the stress.\nThe force fields of a landing grid were similar. A tuning principle was\ninvolved, but basically a landing grid clamped an area of stress around\na spaceship, and the ship couldn't move out of it. When the landing grid\nmoved the stressed area up or down--why--that was it.\n\nAll this was known to everybody. But a third trick had been evolved on\nZan. It was based on the fact that ball lightning could be generated by\na circuit fundamentally akin to the other two. Ball lightning was an\narea of space so stressed that its energy-content could leak out only\nvery slowly, unless it made contact with a conductor, when all bets were\noff. It blew. And the Zan pirates used ball lightning to force the\nsurrender of their victims.\n\nHoddan began to draw diagrams. The Lawlor drive-unit had been installed\nlong after the yacht was built. It would be modern, with no nonsense\nabout it. With such-and-such of its electronic components cut out, and\nsuch-and-such other ones cut in, it would become a perfectly practical\nball lightning generator, capable of placing bolts wherever one wanted\nthem. This was standard Zan practice. Hoddan's grandfather had used it\nfor years. It had the advantage that it could be used inside a gravity\nfield, where a Lawlor drive could not. It had the other advantage that\ncommercial spacecraft could not mount such gadgets for defense, because\nthe insurance companies objected to meddling with Lawlor drive\ninstallations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan set to work with the remnants of a tool shop on the ancient yacht\nand some antique coils and condensers and such. He became filled with\nzest. He almost forgot that he was the skipper of an elderly craft which\nshould have been scrapped before he was born.\n\nBut even he grew hungry, and he realized that nobody offered him food.\nHe went indignantly into the yacht's central saloon and found his seven\ncrew-members snoring stertorously, sprawled in stray places here and\nthere.\n\nHe woke them with great sternness. He set them furiously to work on that\nhousekeeping--including meals--which can be neglected in a feudal castle\nbecause strong outside winds blow smells away and dry up smelly objects,\nbut which must be practiced in a spaceship.\n\nHe went back to work. Suddenly he stopped and meditated afresh, and\nceased his actual labor to draw a diagram which he regarded with great\naffection. He returned to his adaptation of the Lawlor drive to the\nproduction of ball lightning.\n\nIt was possible to wind coils. A certain percentage of the old\ncondensers held a charge. He tapped the drive-unit for brazing current,\nand the drill-press became a die-stamping device for small parts. He\nbuilt up the elements of a vacuum tube such as is normally found only in\na landing grid control room. He set up a vacuum-valve arrangement in the\nbase of a large glass jar. He put that jar in the boat's air lock, bled\nthe air to emptiness, and flashed the tube's quaint elements. He brought\nit back and went out of overdrive while he hooked the entire new\nassembly into the drive-circuit, with cut-outs and switches to be\noperated from the yacht's instrument board.\n\nFinished, he examined the stars. The nearby suns were totally strange in\ntheir arrangement. But the Coalsack area was a space-mark good for half\na sector of the galaxy. There was a condensation in the Nearer Rim for a\nsecond bearing. And a certain calcium cloud with a star-cluster behind\nit was as good as a highway sign for locating one's self.\n\nHe lined up the yacht again and went into overdrive once more. Two days\nlater he came out, again surveyed the cosmos, again went into overdrive,\nagain came out, once more made a hop in faster-than-light travel--and he\nwas in the solar system of which Walden was the ornament and pride.\n\nHe used the telescope and contemplated Walden on its screen. The space\nyacht moved briskly toward it. His seven Darthian crewmen, aware of\ncoming action, dolefully sharpened their two-foot knives. They did not\nknow what else to do, but they were far from happy.\n\nHoddan shared their depression. Such gloomy anticipations before\nstirring events are proof that a man is not a fool. Hoddan's grandfather\nhad been known to observe that when a man can imagine all kinds of\ntroubles and risks and disasters ahead of him, he is usually right.\nHoddan shared that view. But it would not do to back out now.\n\nHe examined Walden painstakingly while the yacht sped on. He saw an\nocean come out of the twilight zone of dawn. By the charts, the capital\ncity and the spaceport should be on that ocean's western shore. After a\nsuitable and very long interval, the site of the capital city came\naround the edge of the planet.\n\nFrom a bare hundred thousand miles, Hoddan stepped up magnification to\nits limit and looked again. Then Walden more than filled the telescope's\nfield. He could see only a very small fraction of the planet's surface.\nHe had to hunt before he found the capital city again. Then it was very\nclear. He saw the curving lines of its highways and the criss-cross\npattern of its streets. Buildings as such, however, did not show. But he\nmade out the spaceport and the shadow of the landing grid, and in the\nvery center of that grid there was something silvery which cast a shadow\nof its own. A ship. A liner.\n\nThere was a tap on the control-room door. Thal.\n\n\"Anything happening?\" he asked uneasily.\n\n\"I just sighted the ship we're going to take,\" said Hoddan.\n\nThal looked unhappy. He withdrew. Hoddan plotted out the extremely\nroundabout course he must take to end up with the liner and the yacht\ntraveling in the same direction and the same speed, so capture would be\npossible.\n\nHe put the yacht on the line required. He threw on full power. Actually,\nhe headed partly away from his intended victim. The little yacht plunged\nforward. Nothing seemed to happen. Time passed. Hoddan had nothing to do\nbut worry. He worried.\n\nThal tapped on the door again.\n\n\"About time to get ready to fight?\" he asked dolefully.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Hoddan. \"I'm running away from our victim, now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother half hour. The course changed. The yacht was around behind\nWalden. The whole planet lay between it and its intended prey. The\ncourse of the small ship curved, now. It would pass almost close enough\nto clip the topmost tips of Walden's atmosphere. There was nothing for\nHoddan to do but think morbid thoughts. He thought them.\n\nThe Lawlor drive began to burble. He cut it off. He sat gloomily in the\ncontrol room, occasionally glancing at the nearing expanse of rushing\nmottled surface presented by the now-nearby planet. Its attraction bent\nthe path of the yacht. It was now a parabolic curve.\n\nPresently the surface diminished a little. The yacht was increasing its\ndistance from it. Hoddan used the telescope. He searched the space ahead\nwith full-width field. He found the liner. It rose steadily. The grid\nstill thrust it upward with an even, continuous acceleration. It had to\nbe not less than forty thousand miles out before it could take to\noverdrive. But at that distance it would have an outward velocity which\nwould take it on out indefinitely. At ten thousand miles, certainly, the\ngrid-fields would let go.\n\nThey did. Hoddan could tell because the liner had been pointed base down\ntoward the planet when the force fields picked it up. Now it wabbled\nslightly. It was free. It was no longer held solidly. From now on it\nfloated up on momentum.\n\nHoddan nibbled at his fingernails. There was nothing to be done for\nforty minutes more. Presently there was nothing to be done for thirty.\nFor twenty. Ten. Five. Three. Two--\n\nThe liner was barely twenty miles away when Hoddan fired his rockets.\nThey made a colossal cloud of vapor in emptiness. The yacht stirred\nfaintly, shifted deftly, lost just a suitable amount of velocity--which\nnow was nearly straight up from the planet--and moved with precision and\ndirectness toward the liner. Hoddan stirred his controls and swung the\nwhole small ship. Here, obviously, he could not use the space-drive for\nits proper purpose. But a switch cut out certain elements of the Lawlor\nunit and cut in those others which made the modified drive-unit into a\nball lightning projector.\n\nA flaming speck of pure incandescence sped from the yacht through\nemptiness. It would miss-- No. Hoddan swerved it. It struck the liner's\nhull. It would momentarily paralyze every bit of electric equipment in\nthe ship. It would definitely not go unnoticed.\n\n\"Calling liner,\" said Hoddan painfully into a microphone. \"Calling\nliner! We are pirates, attacking your ship. You have ten seconds to get\ninto your lifeboats or we will hull you!\"\n\nHe settled back, again nibbling at his fingernails. He was acutely\ndisturbed. At the end of ten seconds the distance between the two ships\nwas perceptibly less.\n\nHe flung a second ball lightning bolt across the diminished space. He\nsent it whirling round and round the liner in a tight spiral. He ended\nby having it touch the liner's bow. Liquid light ran over the entire\nhull.\n\n\"Your ten seconds are up,\" he said worriedly. \"If you don't get out--\"\n\nBut then he relaxed. A boat-blister on the liner opened. The boat did\nnot release itself. It could not possibly take on its complement of\npassengers and crew in so short a time. The opening of the blister was a\nsign of surrender.\n\nThe two first ball lightning bolts were miniatures. Hoddan now projected\na full-sized ball. It glittered viciously in emptiness, the plasma-gas\nnecessary for its existence furnishing a medium for radiation. It sped\ntoward the liner and hung off its side, menacingly. The yacht from Darth\nmoved steadily closer. Five miles. Two.\n\n\"All out,\" said Hoddan regretfully. \"We can't wait any longer!\"\n\nA boat darted away from the liner. A second. A third and fourth and\nfifth. The last boat lingered desperately. The yacht was less than a\nmile away when it broke free and plunged frantically toward the planet\nit had left a little while before. The other boats were already\nstreaking downward, trails of rocket-fumes expanding behind them. The\ncrew of the landing grid would pick them up for safe and gentle landing.\n\nHoddan sighed in relief. He played delicately upon the yacht's\nrocket-controls. He carefully maneuvered the very last of the novelties\nhe had built into an originally simple Lawlor drive-unit. The two ships\ncame together with a distinct clanking sound. It seemed horribly loud.\n\nThal jerked open the door, ashen-white.\n\n\"W-we hit something! Wh-when do we fight?\"\n\nHoddan said ruefully:\n\n\"I forgot. The fighting's over. But bring your stun-pistols. Nobody'd\nstay behind, but somebody might have gotten left.\"\n\nHe rose, to take over the captured ship.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nNormally, at overdrive cruising speed, it would be a week's journey from\nWalden to the planet Krim. Hoddan made it in five days. There was\nreason. He wanted to beat the news of his piracy to Krim. He could\nendure suspicion, and he wouldn't mind doubt, but he did not want\ncertainty of his nefarious behavior to interfere with the purposes of\nhis call.\n\nThe space yacht, sealed tightly, floated in an orbit far out in\nemptiness. The big ship went down alone by landing grid. It glittered\nbrightly as it descended. When it touched ground and the grid's force\nfields cut off, it looked very modern and very crisp and strictly\nbusinesslike. Actually, the capture of this particular liner was a bit\nof luck, for Hoddan. It was not one of the giant inter-cluster ships\nwhich make runs of thousands of light-years and deign to stop only at\nvery major planets. It was a medium ship of five thousand tons burden,\ndesigned for service in the Horsehead Nebula region. It was brand-new\nand on the way from its builders to its owners when Hoddan interfered.\nNaturally, though, it carried cargo on its maiden voyage.\n\nHoddan spoke curtly to the control room of the grid.\n\n\"I'm non-sked,\" he explained. \"New ship. I got a freak charter party\nover on Walden and I have to get rid of my cargo. How about shifting me\nto a delay space until I can talk to some brokers?\"\n\nThe force fields came on again and the liner moved very delicately to a\nposition at the side of the grid's central space. There it would be out\nof the way.\n\nHoddan dressed himself carefully in garments found in the liner's\nskipper's cabin. He found Thal wearing an apron and an embittered\nexpression. He ceased to wield a mop as Hoddan halted before him.\n\n\"I'm going ashore,\" said Hoddan crisply. \"You're in charge until I get\nback.\"\n\n\"In charge of what?\" demanded Thal bitterly. \"Of a bunch of male\nhousemaids! I run a mop! And me a Darthian gentleman! I thought I was\nbeing a pirate! What do I do? I scrub floors! I wash paint! I stencil\ncases in cargo holds! I paint over names and put others in their places!\nMe, a Darthian gentleman!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hoddan. \"A pirate. If I don't get back, you and the others\ncan't work this ship, and presently the police of Krim will ask why.\nThey'll recheck my careful forgeries, and you'll all be hung for piracy.\nSo don't let anybody in. Don't talk to anybody. If you do--_pfft!_\"\n\nHe drew his finger across his throat, and nodded, and went cheerfully\nout the crew's landing-door in the very base of the ship. He went across\nthe tarmac and out between two of the gigantic steel arches of the grid.\nHe hired a ground vehicle.\n\n\"Where?\" asked the driver.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Hoddan. \"There's a firm of lawyers.... I can't remember\nthe name--\"\n\n\"There's millions of 'em,\" said the driver.\n\n\"This is a special one,\" explained Hoddan. \"It's so dignified they won't\ntalk to you unless you're a great-grandson of a client. They're so\nethical they won't touch a case of under a million credits. They've got\nabout nineteen names in the firm title and--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the ground-car driver. \"That'll be-- Hell! I can't remember\nthe name either. But I'll take you there.\"\n\nHe drove out into traffic. Hoddan relaxed. Then he tensed again. He had\nnot been in a city since he stopped briefly in this on the way to Darth.\nThe traffic was abominable. And he, who'd been in various pitched\nbattles on Darth and had only lately captured a ship in space-- Hoddan\ngrew apprehensive as his ground-car charged into the thick of hooting,\nrushing, squealing vehicles. When the car came to a stop he was\nrelieved.\n\n\"It's yonder,\" said the driver. \"You'll find the name on the directory.\"\n\nHoddan paid and went inside the gigantic building. He looked at the\ndirectory and shrugged. He went to the downstairs guard. He explained\nthat he was looking for a firm of lawyers whose name was not on the\ndirectory list. They were extremely conservative and of the highest\npossible reputation. They didn't seek clients--\n\n\"Forty-two and forty-three,\" said the guard, frowning. \"I ain't supposed\nto give it out, but--floors forty-two and-three.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan went up. He was unknown. A receptionist looked at him with\nsurprised aversion.\n\n\"I have a case of space piracy,\" said Hoddan polite. \"A member of the\nfirm, please.\"\n\nTen minutes later he eased himself into the easiest of easy-chairs. A\ngray-haired man of infinite dignity said:\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Hoddan modestly, \"a pirate. I have a ship in the spaceport\nwith very convincing papers and a cargo of Rigellian furs, jewelry from\nthe Cetis planets, and a rather large quantity of bulk melacynth. I want\nto dispose of the cargo and invest a considerable part of the proceeds\nin conservative stocks on Krim.\"\n\nThe lawyer frowned. He looked shocked. Then he said carefully:\n\n\"You made two statements. One was that you are a pirate. Taken by\nitself, that is not my concern. The other is that you wish to dispose of\ncertain cargo and invest in reputable businesses on Krim. I assume that\nthere is no connection between the two observations.\"\n\nHe paused. Hoddan said nothing. The lawyer went on, with dignity:\n\n\"Of course our firm is not in the brokerage business. However, we can\nrepresent you in your dealing with local brokers. And obviously we can\nadvise you--\"\n\n\"I also wish to buy,\" said Hoddan, \"a complete shipload of agricultural\nmachinery, a microfilm technical library, machine tools, vision-tape\ntechnical instructors and libraries of tape for them, generators, and\nsuch things.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said the lawyer. \"I will send one of our clerks to examine\nyour cargo so he can deal properly with the brokers. You will tell him\nin detail what you wish to buy.\"\n\nHoddan stood up.\n\n\"I'll take him to the ship now.\"\n\nHe was mildly surprised at the smoothness with which matters proceeded.\nHe took a young clerk to the ship. He showed him the ship's papers as\nedited by himself. He took him through the cargo holds. He discussed in\nsome detail what he wished to buy.\n\nWhen the clerk left, Thal came to complain again.\n\n\"Look here!\" he said bitterly, \"we've scrubbed this ship from one end\nto the other! There's not a speck or a fingermark on it. And we're still\nscrubbing! We captured this ship! Is this pirate revels?\"\n\nHoddan said:\n\n\"There's money coming. I'll let you boys ashore with some cash in your\npockets presently.\"\n\nBrokers came, escorted by the lawyer's clerk. They squabbled furiously\nwith him. But the dignity of the firm he represented was extreme. There\nwas no suspicion--no overt suspicion anyhow--and the furs went. The\nclerk painstakingly informed Hoddan that he could draw so much. More\nbrokers came. The jewelry went. The lawyer's clerk jotted down figures\nand told Hoddan the net. The bulk melacynth was taken over by a group of\nbrokers, none of whom could handle it alone.\n\nHoddan drew cash and sent his Darthians ashore with a thousand credits\napiece. With bright and shining faces, they headed for the nearest bars.\n\n\"As soon as my ship's loaded,\" Hoddan told the clerk, \"I'll want to get\nthem out of jail.\"\n\nThe clerk nodded. He brought salesmen of agricultural machinery.\nRepresentatives of microfilm libraries. Manufacturers of generators,\nvision-tape instructors and allied lines. Hoddan bought, painstakingly.\nDelivery was promised for the next day.\n\n\"Now,\" said the clerk, \"about the investments you wish to make with the\nbalance?\"\n\n\"I'll want a reasonable sum in cash,\" said Hoddan reflectively. \"But....\nwell ... I've been told that insurance is a fine, conservative business.\nAs I understand it, most insurance organizations are divided into\ndivisions which are separately incorporated. There will be a\nlife-insurance division, a casualty division, and so on. Is that right?\nAnd one may invest in any of them separately?\"\n\nThe clerk said impassively:\n\n\"I was given to understand, sir, that you are interested in\nrisk-insurance. Perhaps especially risk-insurance covering piracy. I was\ngiven quotations on the risk-insurance divisions of all Krim companies.\nOf course those are not very active stocks, but if there were a rumor of\na pirate ship acting in this part of the galaxy, one might anticipate--\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Hoddan. \"Let's see. ... My cargo brought so much....\nHm-m-m.... My purchases will come to so much. Hm-m-m.... My legal fees,\nof course.... I mentioned a sum in cash. Yes. This will be the balance,\nmore or less, which you will put in the stocks you've named, but since I\nanticipate activity in them. I'll want to leave some special\ninstructions.\"\n\nHe gave a detailed, thoughtful account of what he anticipated might be\nfound in news reports of later dates. The clerk noted it all down,\nimpassively. Hoddan added instructions.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the clerk without intonation when he was through. \"If\nyou will come to the office in the morning, sir, the papers will be\ndrawn up and matters can be concluded. Your new cargo can hardly be\ndelivered before then, and if I may say so, sir, your crew won't be\nready. I'd estimate two hours of festivity for each man, and fourteen\nhours for recovery.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hoddan. \"I'll see you in the morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sealed up the ship when the lawyer's clerk departed. Then he felt\nlonely. He was the only living thing in the ship. His footsteps echoed\nhollowly. There was nobody to speak to. Not even anybody to threaten.\nHe'd done a lot of threatening lately.\n\nHe went forlornly to the cabin once occupied by the liner's former\nskipper. His loneliness increased. He began to feel those daunting\nself-doubts such as plague the most unselfish and conscientious people.\nHis actions to date, of course, did not trouble him. Today's actions\nwere the ones which bothered his conscience. He felt that they were not\nquite adequate. The balance left in the lawyer's hands would not be\nnearly enough to cover a certain deficit which in justice he felt\nhimself bound to make up. It had been his thought to make this\nenterprise self-liquidating--everybody concerned making a profit,\nincluding the owners of the ship and cargo he had pirated. But he wasn't\nsure.\n\nHe reflected that his grandfather would not have been disturbed about\nsuch a matter. That elderly pirate would have felt wholly at ease. It\nwas his conviction that piracy was an essential part of the working of\nthe galaxy's economic system. Hoddan, indeed, could remember him saying\nprecisely, snipping off the ends of his words as he spoke:\n\n\"I tell y', piracy's what keeps the galaxy's business thriving!\nEverybody knows business suffers when retail trade slacks down. It backs\nup the movement of inventories. They get too big. That backs up orders\nto the factories. They lay off men. And when men are laid off they don't\nhave money to spend, so retail trade slacks off some more, and that\nbacks up inventories some more, and that backs up orders to factories\nand makes unemployment and hurts retail trade again. It's a feed-back.\nSee?\" It was Hoddan's grandfather's custom, at this point, to stare\nshrewdly at each of his listeners in turn.\n\n\"But suppose somebody pirates a ship? The owners don't lose. It's\ninsured. They order another ship built right away. Men get hired to\nbuild it and they're paid money to spend in retail trade and that moves\ninventories and industry picks up. More'n that, more people insure\nagainst piracy. Insurance companies hire more clerks and bookkeepers.\nThey get more money for retail trade and to move inventories and keep\nfactories going and get more people hired.... Y'see? It's piracy that\nkeeps business in this galaxy goin'!\"\n\nHoddan had known doubts about this, but it could not be entirely wrong.\nHe'd put a good part of the proceeds of his piracy in risk-insurance\nstocks, and he counted on them to make all his actions as benevolent to\neverybody concerned as his intentions had been, and were. But it might\nnot be true enough. It might be less than ... well ... sufficiently true\nin a particular instance. And therefore--\n\nThen he saw how things could be worked out so that there could be no\ndoubt. He began to work out the details. He drifted off to sleep in the\nact of composing a letter in his head to his grandfather on the pirate\nplanet Zan.\n\nWhen morning came on Krim, catawheel trucks came bringing gigantic\nagricultural machines of a sort that would normally never be shipped by\nspace freight. There came generators and turbines and tanks of plastic,\nand vision-tape instructors and great boxes full of tape for them. There\nwere machine tools and cutting tips--these last in vast quantity--and\nvery many items that the emigrants of Colin probably would not expect,\nand might not even recognize. The cargo holds of the liner filled.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe went to the office of his attorneys. He read and signed papers, in an\natmosphere of great dignity and ethical purpose. The lawyer's clerk\nattended him to the police office, where seven dreary Darthians with\noversized hangovers tried dismally to cheer themselves by memories of\nhow they got that way. He got them out and to the ship. The lawyer's\nclerk produced a rather weighty if small box with an air of extreme\nsolemnity.\n\n\"The currency you wanted, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hoddan. \"That's the last of our business?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the clerk. He hesitated, and for the first time showed\na trace of human curiosity. \"Could I ask a question, sir, about piracy?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Hoddan. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"When you ... ah ... captured this ship, sir,\" said the clerk hopefully,\n\"did you ... ah ... shoot the men and keep the women?\"\n\nHoddan sighed.\n\n\"Much,\" he said regretfully, \"as I hate to spoil an enlivening\ntheory--no. These are modern days. Efficiency has invaded even the\npirate business. I used my crew for floor-scrubbing and cookery.\"\n\nHe closed the ship port gently and went up to the control room to call\nthe landing grid operators. In minutes the captured liner, loaded down\nagain, lifted toward the stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd all the journey back to Darth was as anticlimactic as that. There\nwas no trouble finding the space yacht in its remote orbit. Hoddan sent\nout an unlocking signal, and a keyed transmitter began to send a signal\non which to home. When the liner nudged alongside it, Hoddan's last\ncontrivance operated and the yacht clung fast to the larger ship's hull.\nThere were four days in overdrive. There were three or four pauses for\nposition-finding. The stop-over on Krim had cost some delay, but Hoddan\narrived back at a positive sight of Darth's sun within a day or so of\nstandard space drive direct from Walden. Then there was little or no\ntime lost in getting into orbit with the junk yard space fleet of the\nemigrants. Shortly thereafter he called the leader's ship with only mild\nworries about possible disasters that might have happened while he was\naway.\n\n\"Calling the leader's ship,\" he said crisply. \"Calling the leader's\nship! This is Bron Hoddan, reporting back from Walden with a ship and\nmachinery contributed for your use!\"\n\nThe harsh voice of the bearded old leader of the emigrants seemed\nsomehow broken when he replied. He called down blessings on Hoddan, who\ncould use them. Then there was the matter of getting emigrants on board\nthe new ship. They didn't know how to use the boat-blister lifeboat\ntubes. Hoddan had to demonstrate. But shortly after there were twenty,\nthirty, fifty of the folk from Colin, feverishly searching the ship and\nincredulously reporting what they found.\n\n\"It's impossible!\" said the old man. \"It's impossible!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" said Hoddan. \"It's unlikely, but it's happened.\nI'm only afraid it's not enough.\"\n\n\"It is ... many times what we hoped,\" said the old man humbly. \"Only--\"\nHe stopped. \"We are more grateful than we can say.\"\n\nHoddan took a deep breath.\n\n\"I'd like to take my crew back home,\" he explained. \"And come back\nand ... well ... perhaps I can be useful explaining things. And I'd like\nto ask a great favor of you ... for my own work.\"\n\n\"But naturally,\" said the old man. \"Of course. We will await your\nreturn. Naturally! And ... perhaps we can ... we can arrange\nsomething--\"\n\nHoddan was relieved. There did seem a slightly strange limitation to the\nhappiness of the emigrants. They were passionately rejoiceful over the\nagricultural machinery. But they seemed rather dutifully than truly\nhappy over the microfilm library. The vision-tape instructors were the\nobjects of polite comment only. Hoddan felt a vague discomfort. There\nseemed to be a sort of secret desperation in the atmosphere, which they\nwould not admit or mention. But he was coming back. Of course.\n\nHe brought the spaceboat over to the new liner. He hooked onto a\nlifeboat blister and his seven Darthians crawled through the lifeboat\ntube. Hoddan pulled away quickly before somebody thought to ask why\nthere were no lifeboats in the places so plainly made for them.\n\nHe headed downward when the landmarks on Darth's surface told him that\nDon Loris' castle would shortly come over the horizon. He was just\ntouching atmosphere when it did. The boat's rocket-tanks had been\nrefilled, and he burned fuel recklessly to make a dramatic landing\nwithin a hundred yards of the battlements where Fani had once\nthoughtfully had a coil of rope ready for him.\n\nHeads peered at the lifeboat over those same battlements now, but the\ngate was closed. It stayed closed. There was somehow an atmosphere of\nsuspicion amounting to enmity. Hoddan felt unwelcome.\n\n\"All right, boys,\" he said resignedly. \"Out with you and to the castle.\nYou've got your loot from the voyage\"--he'd counted out for each of them\nrather more actual cash than any of them really believed in--\"and I want\nyou to take this box to Don Loris. It's a gift from me. And I want\nto--consult with him about co-operation between the two of us\nin ... ah ... some plans I have. Ask if I may come and talk to him.\"\n\nHis seven former spearmen tumbled out. They marched gleefully to the\ncastle gate. Hoddan saw them tantalizingly displaying large sums in cash\nto the watchers above them. Thal held up the box for Don Loris. It was\nthe box the lawyer's clerk had turned over to him, with a tidy sum in\ncash in it. The sum was partly depleted, now. Hoddan had paid off his\ninvoluntary crew with it--had paid them, in fact, as if they'd done the\nfighting they'd expected and he'd thought would be necessary. But there\nwas still more in it than Don Loris would have gotten from Walden for\nselling him out.\n\nThe castle gate opened, as if grudgingly. The seven went in. With the\nbox.\n\nTime passed. Much time. Hoddan went over the arguments he meant to use\non Don Loris. He needed to make up a very great sum, and it could be\ndone thus-and-so, but thus-and-so required occasional piratical raids,\nwhich called for pirate crews, and if Don Loris would encourage his\nretainers-- He could have gone to another Darthian chieftain, of course,\nbut he knew what kind of scoundrel Don Loris was. He'd have to find out\nabout another man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNearly an hour elapsed before the castle gate opened again. Two files of\nspearmen marched out. There were eight men with a sergeant in command.\nHoddan did not recognize any of them. They came to the spaceboat. The\nsergeant formally presented an official message. Don Loris would admit\nBron Hoddan to his presence, to hear what he had to say.\n\nHoddan felt excessively uncomfortable. Waiting, he'd thought about that\nsecret despair in the emigrant fleet. He worried about it. He was\nconcerned because Don Loris had not welcomed him with cordiality, now\nthat he'd brought back his retainers in good working order. In a sudden\ngloomy premonition, he checked his stun-pistols. They needed charging.\nHe managed it from the lifeboat unit.\n\nHe went forebodingly toward the castle with the eight spearmen\nsurrounding him as cops had once surrounded him on Walden. He did not\nlike to be reminded of it. He frowned to himself as he went in the\ncastle gate, and along a long stone passage, and up stone stairs into\nthe great hall of state. Don Loris, as once before, sat peevishly by the\nhuge fireplace. This time he was almost inside it, with its hood and\nmantel actually over his head. The Lady Fani sat there with him.\n\nDon Loris seemed to put aside his peevishness only a little to greet\nHoddan.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" he said complainingly, \"I don't like to welcome you\nwith reproaches, but do you know that when you absconded with that\nspaceboat, you made a mortal enemy for me? It's a fact! My neighbor, on\nwhose land the boat descended, was deeply hurt. He considered it his\nproperty. He had summoned his retainers for a fight over it when I heard\nof his resentment and partly soothed him with apologies and presents.\nBut he still considers that I should return it to him, whenever you\nappear here with it!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Hoddan. \"That's too bad.\"\n\nThings looked ominous. The Lady Fani looked at him strangely. As if she\ntried to tell him something without speaking it. She looked as if she\nhad wept lately.\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Don Loris fretfully, \"you gave me a very pretty\npresent just now. But my retainers tell me that you came back with a\nship. A very fine ship. What became of it? The landing grid has been\nrepaired at last and you could have landed it. What happened to it?\"\n\n\"I gave it away,\" said Hoddan. He saw what Fani was trying to tell him.\nOne corridor ... no, two ... leading toward the great hall was filled\nwith spearmen. His tone turned sardonic. \"I gave it to a poor old man.\"\n\nDon Loris shook his head.\n\n\"That's not right, Hoddan! That fleet overhead, now. If they are pirates\nand want some of my men for crews, they should come to me! I don't take\nkindly to the idea of your kidnaping my men and carrying them off on\npiratical excursions! They must be profitable! But if you can afford to\ngive me presents like that, and be so lavish with my retainers ... why I\ndon't see why--\"\n\nHoddan grimaced.\n\n\"I came to arrange a deal on that order,\" he observed.\n\n\"I don't think I like it,\" said Don Loris peevishly. \"I prefer to deal\nwith people direct. I'll arrange about the landing grid, and for a\nregular recruiting service which I will conduct, of course. But you ...\nyou are irresponsible! I wish you well, but when you carry my men off\nfor pirates, and make my neighbors into my enemies, and infect my\ndaughter with strange notions and the government of a friendly planet\nasks me in so many words not to shelter you any longer ... why that's\nthe end, Hoddan. So with great regret--\"\n\n\"The regret is mine,\" said Hoddan. Thoughtfully, he aimed a stun-pistol\nat a slowly opening door. He pulled the trigger. Yells followed its\nhumming, because not everybody it hit was knocked out. Nor did it hit\neverybody in the corridor. Men came surging out of one door, and then\ntwo, to require the attention of his weapons.\n\nThen a spear went past Hoddan's face and missed him only by inches. It\nburied its point in the floor. A whirling knife spun past his nose. He\nglanced up. There were balconies all around the great hall, and men\npopped up from behind the railings and threw things at him. They popped\ndown out of sight instantly. There was no rhythm involved. He could not\nanticipate their rising, nor shoot them through the balcony front. And\nmore men infiltrated the hall, getting behind heavy chairs and tables,\nto push toward him behind them as shovable shields. More spears and\nknives flew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Bron!\" cried the Lady Fani, throatily.\n\nHe thought she had an exit for him. He sprang to her side.\n\n\"I ... I didn't want you to come,\" she wept.\n\nThere was a singular pause in the clangings and clashings of weapons on\nthe floor. For a second the noises continued. Then they stopped. Then\none man popped up and hurled a knife. The clang of its fall was a very\nlonely one. Don Loris fairly howled at him.\n\n\"Idiot! Think of the Lady Fani!\"\n\nThe Lady Fani suddenly smiled tremulously.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" she said. \"They don't dare do anything while you're as\nclose to me as this!\"\n\n\"Do you suppose,\" asked Hoddan, \"I could count on that?\"\n\n\"I'm certain of it!\" said Fani. \"And I think you'd better.\"\n\n\"Then, excuse me,\" said Hoddan with great politeness.\n\nHe swung her up and over his shoulder. With a stun-pistol in his free\nhand he headed down the hall.\n\n\"Outside,\" she said zestfully. \"Get out the side door and turn left, and\nnobody can jump down on your neck. Then left again to the gate.\"\n\nHe obeyed. Now and again he got in a pot-shot with his pistol. Don Loris\nhad turned the castle into a very pretty trap. The Lady Fani said\nplaintively:\n\n\"This is terribly undignified, and I can't see where we're going. Where\nare we now?\"\n\n\"Almost at the gate,\" panted Hoddan. \"At it, now.\" He swung out of the\nmassive entrance to Don Loris' stronghold. \"I can put you down now.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" said the Lady Fani. \"In spite of the end of me that's\nuppermost, I think you'd better make for the spaceboat exactly as we\nare.\"\n\nAgain Hoddan obeyed, racing across the open ground. Howls of fury\nfollowed him. It was evidently the opinion of the castle that the Lady\nFani was to be abducted in the place of the seven returned spearmen.\n\nHoddan, breathing hard, reached the spaceboat. He put Fani down and said\nanxiously:\n\n\"You're all right? I'm very much in your debt! I was in a spot!\" Then he\nnodded toward the castle. \"They are upset, aren't they? They must think\nI mean to kidnap you.\"\n\nThe Lady Fani beamed.\n\n\"It would be terrible if you did,\" she said hopefully. \"I couldn't do a\nthing to stop you! And a successful public abduction's a legal marriage,\non Darth! Wouldn't it be terrible?\"\n\nHoddan mopped his face and patted her reassuringly on the shoulder.\n\n\"Don't worry!\" he said warmly. \"You just got me out of an awful fix!\nYou're my friend! And anyhow I'm going to marry a girl on Walden, named\nNedda. Good-by, Fani! Keep clear of the rocket blast.\"\n\nHe went into the boatport, turned to beam paternally back at her, and\nshut the port behind him. Seconds later the spaceboat took off. It left\nbehind clouds of rocket smoke.\n\nAnd, though Hoddan hadn't the faintest idea of it, it left behind the\nmaddest girl in several solar systems.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nIt is the custom of all men, everywhere, to be obtuse where women are\nconcerned. Hoddan went skyward in the spaceboat with feelings of warm\ngratitude toward the Lady Fani. He had not the slightest inkling that\nshe, who had twice spoiled her father's skulduggery so far as it\naffected him, felt any but the friendliest of feelings toward him. He\nremembered that he had kept her from the necessity of adjusting to\nmatrimony with the Lord Ghek. It did not occur to him that most girls\nintend to adjust to marriage with somebody, anyhow, and he did not even\nsuspect that it is a feminine instinct to make a highly dramatic and\nromantic production of their marriage so they'll have something to be\nsentimental about in later years.\n\nAs Hoddan drove on up and up, the sky became deep purple and then black\nvelvet set with flecks of fire. He was relieved by the welcome he'd\nreceived earlier today from the emigrants, but he remained slightly\npuzzled by a very faint impression of desperation remaining. He felt\nvery virtuous on the whole, however, and his plans for the future were\nspecific. He'd already composed a letter to his grandfather, which he'd\nask the emigrant fleet to deliver. He had another letter in his mind--a\nform letter, practically a public-relations circular--which he hoped to\nwhip into shape before the emigrants got too anxious to be on their way.\nHe considered that he needed to earn a little more of their gratitude so\nhe could make everything come out even; self-liquidated; everybody\nsatisfied and happy but himself.\n\nFor himself he anticipated only the deep satisfaction of accomplishment.\nHe'd wanted to do great things since he was a small boy, and in\nelectronics since his adolescence, when he'd found textbooks in the\nlibraries of looted spaceships. He'd gone to Walden in the hope of\nachievement. There, of course, he failed because in a free economy\nindustrialists consider that freedom is the privilege to be stupid\nwithout penalty. In other than free economies, of course, stupidity is\nheld to be the duty of administrators. But Hoddan now believed himself\nin the fascinating situation of having knowledge and abilities which\nwere needed by people who knew their need.\n\nIt was only when he'd made contact with the fleet, and was in the act of\nmaneuvering toward a boat-blister on the liner he'd brought back, that\ndoubts again assailed him. He had done a few things--accomplished a\nlittle. He'd devised a broadcast-power receptor and a microwave\nprojector and he'd turned a Lawlor drive into a ball lightning projector\nand worked out a few little things like that. But the first had been\ninvented before by somebody in the Cetis cluster, and the second could\nhave been made by anybody and the third was standard practice on Zan. He\nstill had to do something significant.\n\nWhen he made fast to the liner and crawled through the boat-tube to its\nhull, he was in a state of doubt which passed very well for modesty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bearded old man received him in the skipper's quarters, which Hoddan\nhimself had occupied for a few days. He looked very weary. He seemed to\nhave aged, in hours.\n\n\"We grow more astounded by the minute,\" he told Hoddan heavily, \"by what\nyou have brought us. Ten shiploads like this and we would be better\nequipped than we believed ourselves in the beginning. It looks as if\nsome thousands of us will now be able to survive our colonization of the\nplanet Thetis.\"\n\nHoddan gaped at him. The old man put his hand on Hoddan's shoulder.\n\n\"We are grateful,\" he said with a pathetic attempt at warmth. \"Please do\nnot doubt that! It is only that ... that-- You had to accept what was\ngiven for our use. But I cannot help wishing very desperately that ...\nthat instead of unfamiliar tools for metal-working and machines with\ntapes which show pictures.... I wish that even one more jungle-plow had\nbeen included!\"\n\nHoddan's jaw dropped. The people of Colin wanted planet-subduing\nmachinery. They wanted it so badly that they did not want anything else.\nThey could not even see that anything else had any value at all. Most of\nthem could only look forward to starvation when the ship supplies were\nexhausted, because not enough ground could be broken and cultivated\nearly enough to grow food enough in time.\n\n\"Would it,\" asked the old man desperately, \"be possible to exchange\nthese useless machines for others that will be useful?\"\n\n\"L--let me talk to your mechanics, sir,\" said Hoddan unhappily. \"Maybe\nsomething can be done.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe restrained himself from tearing his hair as he went to where\nmechanics of the fleet looked over their treasure-trove. He'd come up to\nthe fleet again to gloat and do great things for people who needed him\nand knew it. But he faced the hopelessness of people to whom his utmost\neffort seemed mockery because it was so far from being enough.\n\nHe gathered together the men who'd tried to keep the fleet's ships in\nworking order during their flight. They were competent men, of course.\nThey were resolute. But now they had given up hope. Hoddan began to\nlecture them. They needed machines. He hadn't brought the machines they\nwanted, perhaps, but he'd brought the machines to make them with. Here\nwere automatic shapers, turret lathes, dicers. Here were cutting-points\nfor machines these machines could make, to make the machines the colony\non Thetis would require. He'd brought these because they had the raw\nmaterial. They had their ships themselves! Even some of the junk they\ncarried in crates was good metal, merely worn out in its present form.\nThey could make anything they needed with what he'd brought them. For\nexample, he'd show them how to make ... say ... a lumber saw.\n\nHe showed them how to make a lumber saw--slender, rapierlike revolving\ntool with which a man stabbed a tree and cut outward with the speed of a\nknife cutting hot butter. And one could mount it so--and cut out planks\nand beams for temporary bridges and such constructions.\n\nThey watched, baffled. They gave no sign of hope. They did not want\nlumber saws. They wanted jungle-breaking machinery.\n\n\"I've brought you everything!\" he insisted. \"You've got a civilization,\ncompact, on this ship! You've got life instead of starvation! Look at\nthis. I make a water pump to irrigate your fields!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore their eyes he turned out an irrigation pump on an automatic\nshaper. He showed them that the shaper went on, by itself, making other\npumps without further instructions than the by-hand control of the tools\nthat formed the first.\n\nThe mechanics stirred uneasily. They had watched without comprehension.\nNow they listened without enthusiasm. Their eyes were like those of\nchildren who watch marvels without comprehension.\n\nHe made a sledge whose runners slid on air between themselves and\nwhatever object would otherwise have touched them. It was practically\nfrictionless. He made a machine to make nails--utterly simple. He made a\npower hammer which hummed and pushed nails into any object that needed\nto be nailed. He made--\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and sat down with his head in his hands. The people\nof the fleet faced so overwhelming a catastrophe that they could not see\ninto it. They could only experience it. As their leader would have been\nunable to answer questions about the fleet's predicament before he'd\npoured out the tale in the form it had taken in his mind, now these\nmechanics were unable to see ahead. They were paralyzed by the\ncompleteness of the disaster before them. They could live until the\nsupplies of the fleet gave out. They could not grow fresh supplies\nwithout jungle-breaking machinery. They had to have jungle-breaking\nmachinery. They could not imagine wanting anything less than\njungle-breaking machinery--\n\nHoddan raised his head. The mechanics looked dully at him.\n\n\"You men do maintenance?\" he asked. \"You repair things when they wear\nout on the ships? Have you run out of some materials you need for\nrepairs?\"\n\nAfter a long time a tired-looking man said slowly:\n\n\"On the ship I come from, we're having trouble. Our hydroponic garden\nkeeps the air fresh, o'course. But the water-circulation pipes are gone.\nRusted through. We haven't got any pipe to fix them with. We have to\nkeep the water moving with buckets.\"\n\nHoddan got up. He looked about him. He hadn't brought hydroponic-garden\npipe supplies! And there was no raw material. He took a pair of power\nsnips and cut away a section of cargo space wall-lining. He cut it into\nstrips. He asked the diameter of the pipe. Before their eyes he made\npipe--spirally wound around a mandril and line-welded to solidity.\n\n\"I need some of that on my ship,\" said another man.\n\nThe bearded man said heavily:\n\n\"We'll make some and send it to the ships that need it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hoddan. \"We'll send the tools to make it. We can make the\ntools here. There must be other kinds of repairs that can't be made.\nWith the machines I've brought, we'll make the tools to make the\nrepairs. Picture-tape machines have reels that show exactly how to do\nit.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt was a new idea. The mechanics had other and immediate problems beside\nthe overall disaster of the fleet. Pumps that did not work. Motors that\nheated up. They could envision the meeting of those problems, and they\ncould envision the obtaining of jungle-plows. But they could not imagine\nanything in between. They were capable of learning how to make tools for\nrepairs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan taught them. In one day there were five ships being brought into\nbetter operating condition--for ultimate futility--because of what he'd\nbrought. Two days. Three. Mechanics began to come to the liner. Those\nwho'd learned first pompously passed on what they knew. On the fourth\nday somebody began to use a vision-tape machine to get information on a\nfine point in welding. On the fifth day there were lines of men waiting\nto use them.\n\nOn the sixth day a mechanic on what had been a luxury passenger liner on\nthe other side of the galaxy--but it was scores of years ago--asked to\ntalk to Hoddan by spacephone. He'd been working feverishly at the minor\nrepairs he'd been unable to make for so long. To get material he pulled\na crate off one of the junk machines supplied the fleet. He looked it\nover. He believed that if this piece were made new, and that replaced\nwith sound metal, the machine might be usable!\n\nHoddan had him come to the liner which was now the flagship of the\nfleet. Discussion began. Shaping such large pieces of metal which could\nbe taken from here or there--shaping such large pieces of metal....\nHoddan began to draw diagrams. They were not clear. He drew more.\nAbruptly, he stared at what he'd outlined. Electronics.... He saw\nsomething remarkable. If one applied a perfectly well-known bit of\npure-science information that nobody bothered with-- He finished the\ndiagram and a vast, soothing satisfaction came over him.\n\n\"We've got to get out of here!\" he said. \"Not enough room!\"\n\nHe looked about him. Insensibly, as he talked to the first man on the\nfleet to show imagination, other men had gathered around. They were now\nabsorbed.\n\n\"I think,\" said Hoddan, \"that we can make an electronic field that'll\nsoften the cementite between the crystals of steel, without heating up\nanything else. If it works, we can make die-forgings and die-stampings\nwith plastic dies! And then that useless junk you've got can be\nrebuilt--\"\n\nThey listened gravely, nodding as he talked. They did not quite\nunderstand everything, but they had the habit of believing him now. He\nneeded this and that in the huge cargo spaces of the ship the leader had\nformerly used.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Hoddan. \"How about duplicating these machines and sending\nthem over?\"\n\nThey looked estimatingly at the tool-shop equipment. It could be made to\nduplicate itself--\n\nThe new machine shop, in the ancient ark of space, made another machine\nshop for another ship. In the other ship that tool shop would make\nanother for another ship, which in turn....\n\nBy then Hoddan had a cold-metal die-stamper in operation. It was very\nlarge. It drew on the big ship's drive unit for power. One put a rough\nmass of steel in place between plastic dies. One turned on the power.\nFor the tenth of a second--no longer--the steel was soft as putty. Then\nit stiffened and was warm. But in that tenth of a second it had been\nshaped with precision.\n\nIt took two days to duplicate the jungle-plow Hoddan had first been\nshown, in new sound metal. But after the first one worked triumphantly,\nthey made forty of each part at a time and turned out jungle-plow\nequipment enough for the subjugation of all Thetis' forests.\n\nThere were other enterprises on hand, of course. A mechanic who\nstuttered horribly had an idea. He could not explain it or diagram it.\nSo he made it. It was an electric motor very far ahead of those in the\nmachines of Colin. Hoddan waked from a cat nap with a diagram in his\nhead. He drew it, half-asleep, and later looked and found that his\nunconscious mind had designed a power-supply system which made Walden's\nlook rather primitive--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the first six days Hoddan did not sleep to speak of, and after\nthat he merely cat-napped when he could. But he finally agreed with the\nemigrants' leader--now no longer fierce, but fiercely triumphant--that\nhe thought they could go on. And he would ask a favor. He propped his\neyelids open with his fingers and wrote the letter to his grandfather\nthat he'd composed in his mind in the liner on Krim. He managed to make\none copy, unaddressed, of the public-relations letter that he'd worked\nout at the same time. He put it through a facsimile machine and managed\nto address each of fifty copies. Then he yawned uncontrollably.\n\nHe still yawned when he went to take leave of the leader of the people\nof Colin. That person regarded him with warm eyes.\n\n\"I think everything's all right,\" said Hoddan exhaustedly. \"You've got a\ndozen machine shops and they are multiplying themselves, and you have\ngot some enthusiastic mechanics, now, who're drinking in the vision-tape\nstuff and finding out more than they guessed there was. And they're\nthinking, now and then, for themselves. I think you'll make out.\"\n\nThe bearded man said humbly:\n\n\"I have waited until you said all was well. Will you come with us?\"\n\n\"No-o-o,\" said Hoddan. He yawned again. \"I've got my work here. There's\nan ... obligation I have to meet.\"\n\n\"It must be very admirable work,\" said the old man wistfully. \"I wish we\nhad some young men like you among us.\"\n\n\"You have,\" said Hoddan. \"They will be giving you trouble presently.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head, looking at Hoddan very affectionately\nindeed.\n\n\"We will deliver your letters,\" he said warmly. \"First to Krim, and then\nto Walden. Then we will go on and let down your letter and gift to your\ngrandfather on Zan. Then we will go on toward Thetis. Our mechanics will\nwork at building machines while we are in overdrive. But also they will\nbuild new tool shops and train new mechanics, so that every so often we\nwill need to come out of overdrive to transfer the tools and the men to\nnew ships.\"\n\nHoddan nodded exhaustedly. This was right.\n\n\"So,\" said the old man contentedly, \"we will simply make those transfers\nin orbit about the planets for which we have your letters. But you will\npardon us if we only let down your letters, and do not visit those\nplanets? We have prejudices--\"\n\n\"Perfectly satisfactory,\" said Hoddan. \"So I'll--\"\n\n\"The mechanics you have trained,\" said the old man proudly, \"have made a\nlittle ship ready for you. It is not much larger than your spaceboat,\nbut it is fit for travel between suns, which will be convenient for your\nwork. I hope you will accept it. There is even a tiny tool shop on it!\"\n\nHoddan would have been more touched if he hadn't known about it. But one\nof the men entrusted with the job had harassedly asked him for advice.\nHe knew what he was getting. It was the space yacht he'd used before,\nrefurbished and fitted with everything the emigrants could provide.\n\nHe affected great surprise and expressed unfeigned appreciation. Barely\nan hour later he transferred to it with the spaceboat in tow. He watched\nthe emigrant fleet swing out to emptiness and resume its valiant\njourney. But it was not a hopeless journey, now. In fact, the colony on\nThetis ought to start out better-equipped than most settled planets.\n\nAnd he went to sleep. He'd nothing urgent to do, except allow a certain\namount of time to pass before he did anything. He was exhausted. He\nslept the clock around, and waked and ate sluggishly, and went back to\nsleep again. On the whole, the cosmos did not notice the difference.\nStars flamed in emptiness, and planets rotated sedately on their axes.\nComets flung out gossamer veils or retracted them, and space liners went\nabout upon their lawful occasions. And lovers swore by stars and\nmoons--often quite different stars and moons--and various things\nhappened which had nothing to do with Hoddan.\n\nBut when he waked again he was rested, and he reviewed all his actions\nand his situation. It appeared that matters promised fairly well on the\nemigrant fleet now gone forever. They would remember Hoddan with\naffection for a year or so, and dimly after that. But settling a new\nworld would be enthralling and important work. Nobody'd think of him at\nall, after a certain length of time. But he had to think of an\nobligation he'd assumed on their account.\n\nHe considered his own affairs. He'd told Fani he was going to marry\nNedda. The way things looked, that was no longer so probable. Of course,\nin a year or two, or a few years, he might be out from under the\nobligations he now considered due. In time even the Waldenian government\nwould realize that deathrays don't exist, and a lawyer might be able to\nclear things for his return to Walden. But--Nedda was a nice girl.\n\nHe frowned. That was it. She was a remarkably nice girl. But Hoddan\nsuddenly doubted if she were a delightful one. He found himself\nquestioning that she was exactly and perfectly what his long-cherished\nambitions described. He tried to imagine spending his declining years\nwith Nedda. He couldn't quite picture it as exciting. She did tend to be\na little insipid--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently, gloomy and a trifle dogged about it, he brought the spaceboat\naround to the modernized boatport of the yacht. He got into it, leaving\nthe yacht in orbit. He headed down toward Darth. Now that he'd rested,\nhe had work to do which could not be neglected. To carry out that work,\nhe needed a crew able and willing to pass for pirates for a pirate's\npay. And there were innumerable castles on Darth, with quite as many\nshiftly noblemen, and certainly no fewer plunder-hungry Darthian\ngentlemen hanging around them. But Don Loris' castle had one real\nadvantage and one which existed only in Hoddan's mind.\n\nDon Loris' retainers did know that Hoddan had led their companions to\nloot. Large loot. He'd have less trouble and more enthusiastic support\nfrom Don Loris' retainers than any other. This was true.\n\nThe illusion was that the Lady Fani was his firm personal friend with no\nnonsense about her. This was a very great mistake.\n\nHe landed for the fourth time outside Don Loris' castle. This time he\nhad no booty-laden men to march to the castle and act as heralds of his\npresence. The spaceboat's visionscreens showed Don Loris' stronghold as\nimmense, dark and menacing. Banners flew from its turrets, their colors\nbright in the ruddy light of near-sunset. The gate remained closed. For\na long time there was no sign that his landing had been noted. Then\nthere was movement on the battlements, and a figure began to descend\noutside the wall. It was lowered to the ground by a long rope.\n\nIt reached the ground and shook itself. It marched, toward the spaceboat\nthrough the red and nearly level rays of the dying sun. Hoddan watched\nwith a frown on his face. This wasn't a retainer of Don Loris'. It\nassuredly wasn't Fani. He couldn't even make out its gender until the\nfigure was very near.\n\nThen he looked astonished. It was his old friend Derec, arrived on Darth\na long while since in the spaceboat Hoddan had been using ever since.\nDerec had been his boon companion in the days when he expected to become\nrich by splendid exploits in electronics. Derec was also the character\nwho'd conscientiously told the cops on Hoddan, when they found his\npower-receptor sneaked into a Mid-Continent station and a stray corpse\ncoincidentally outside.\n\nHe opened the boatport and stood in the opening. Derec had been a\nguest--anyhow an inhabitant--of Don Loris' castle for a good long while,\nnow. Hoddan wondered if he considered his quarters cozy.\n\n\"Evening, Derec,\" said Hoddan cordially. \"You're looking well!\"\n\n\"I don't feel it,\" said Derec dismally. \"I feel like a fool in the\ncastle yonder. And the high police official I came here with has gotten\ngrumpy and snaps when I try to speak to him.\"\n\nHoddan said gravely:\n\n\"I'm sure the Lady Fani--\"\n\n\"A tigress!\" said Derec bitterly. \"We don't get along.\"\n\nLooking at Derec, Hoddan found himself able to understand why. Derec was\nthe sort of friend one might make on Walden for lack of something\nbetter. He was well-meaning. He might be capable of splendid\nthings--even heroism. But he was horribly, terribly, appallingly\ncivilized!\n\n\"Well! Well!\" said Hoddan kindly. \"And what's on your mind, Derec?\"\n\n\"I came,\" said Derec dismally, \"to plead with you again, Bron. You must\nsurrender! There's nothing else to do! People can't have deathrays,\nBron! Above all, you mustn't tell the pirates how to make them!\"\n\nHoddan was puzzled for a moment. Then he realized that Derec's\ninformation about the fleet came from the spearmen he'd brought back,\nloaded down with cash. Derec hadn't noticed the absence of the flashing\nlights at sunset--or hadn't realized that they meant the fleet was gone\naway.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Hoddan. \"Why don't you think I've already done it?\"\n\n\"Because they'd have killed you,\" said Derec. \"Don Loris pointed that\nout. He doesn't believe you know how to make deathrays. He says it's\nnot a secret anybody would be willing for anybody else to know. But ...\nyou know the truth, Bron! You killed that poor man back on Walden.\nYou've got to sacrifice yourself for humanity! You'll be treated\nkindly!\"\n\nHoddan shook his head. It seemed somehow very startling for Derec to be\nharping on that same idea, after so many things had happened to Hoddan.\nBut he didn't think Derec would actually expect him to yield to\npersuasion. There must be something else. Derec might even have nerved\nhimself up to something quite desperate.\n\n\"What did you really come here for, Derec?\"\n\n\"To beg you to--\"\n\nThen, in one instant, Derec made an hysterical gesture and Hoddan's\nstun-pistol hummed. A small object left Derec's hand as his muscles\nconvulsed from the stun-pistol bolt. It did not fly quite true. It fell\na foot or so to one side of the boatport instead of inside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt exploded luridly as Derec crumpled from the pistol bolt. There was\nthick, strangling smoke. Hoddan disappeared. When the thickest smoke\ndrifted away there was nothing to be seen but Derec, lying on the\nground, and thinner smoke drifting out of the still-open boatport.\n\nNearly half an hour later, figures came very cautiously toward the\nspaceboat. Thal was their leader. His expression was mournful and\ndepressed. Other brawny retainers came uncertainly behind him. At a nod\nfrom Thal, two of them picked up Derec and carted him off toward the\ncastle.\n\n\"I guess he got it,\" said Thal dismally.\n\nHe peered in. He shook his head.\n\n\"Wounded, maybe, and crawled off to die.\"\n\nHe peered in again and shook his head once more.\n\n\"No sign of 'im.\"\n\nA spearman just behind Thal said:\n\n\"Dirty trick! I was with him to Walden, and he paid off good! A good\nman! Shoulda been a chieftain! Good man!\"\n\nThal entered the spaceboat. Gingerly. He wrinkled his nose at the faint\nsmell of explosive still inside. Another man came in. Another.\n\n\"Say!\" said one of them in a conspiratorial voice. \"We got our share of\nthat loot from Walden. But he hadda share, too! What'd he do with it? He\ncould've kept it in this boat here. We could take a quick look! What Don\nLoris don't know don't hurt him!\"\n\n\"I'm going to find Hoddan first,\" said Thal, with dignity. \"We don't\nhave to carry him outside so's Don Loris knows we're looking for loot,\nbut I'm going to find him first.\"\n\nThere were other men in the spaceboat now. A full dozen of them. Their\nspears were very much in the way.\n\nThe boat door closed quietly. Don Loris' retainers stared at each other.\nThe locking-dogs grumbled for half a second, sealing the door tightly.\nDon Loris' retainers began to babble protestingly.\n\nThere was a roaring outside. The spaceboat stirred. The roaring rose to\nthunder. The boat lurched. It flung the spearmen into a sprawling,\nswearing, terrified heap at the rear end of the boat's interior.\n\nThe boat went on out to space again. In the control room Hoddan said\ndourly to himself:\n\n\"I'm in a rut! I've got to figure out some way to ship a pirate crew\nwithout having to kidnap them. This is getting monotonous!\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nThere was a disturbing air which was shared by all the members of\nHoddan's crew, on the way to Walden. It was not exactly reluctance,\nbecause there was self-evident enthusiasm over the idea of making a\npirate voyage under him. So far as past enterprises were concerned,\nHoddan as a leader was the answer to a Darthian gentleman's prayer. The\npartial looting of Ghek's castle, alone, would have made him a desirable\nleader. But a crew of seven, returned from space, had displayed currency\nwhich amounted to the wealth of fabled Ind. Nobody knew what Ind was,\nany longer, but it was a synonym for fabulous and uncountable riches.\nWhen men went off with Hoddan, they came back rich.\n\nBut nevertheless there was an uncomfortable sort of atmosphere in the\nrenovated yacht. They'd transshipped from the spaceboat to the yacht\nthrough lifeboat tubes, and they were quite docile about it because none\nof them knew how to get back to ground. Hoddan left the spaceboat with a\ntriggerable timing-signal set for use on his return. He'd done a similar\nthing off Krim. He drove the little yacht well out, until Darth was only\na spotted ball with visible clouds and ice caps. Then he lined up for\nWalden, direct, and went into overdrive.\n\nWithin hours he noted the disturbing feel of things. His followers were\nnot happy. They moped. They sat in corners and submerged themselves in\nmisery. Large, massive men with drooping blond mustaches--ideal\ncharacters for the roles of pirates--tended to squeeze tears out of\ntheir eyes at odd moments. When the ship was twelve hours on its way,\nthe atmosphere inside it was funereal. The spearmen did not even gorge\nthemselves on the food with which the yacht was stocked. And when a\nDarthian gentleman lost his appetite, something had to be wrong.\n\nHe called Thal into the control room.\n\n\"What's the matter with the gang?\" he demanded vexedly. \"They look at me\nas if I'd broken all their hearts! Do they want to go back?\"\n\nThal heaved a sigh, indicating depression beside which suicidal mania\nwould be hilarity. He said pathetically:\n\n\"We cannot go back. We cannot ever return to Darth. We are lost men,\ndoomed to wander forever among strangers, or to float as corpses between\nthe stars.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" demanded Hoddan. \"I'm taking you on a pirate cruise\nwhere the loot should be a lot better than last time!\"\n\nThal wept. Hoddan astonishedly regarded his whiskery countenance,\ncontorted with grief and dampened with tears.\n\n\"It happened at the castle,\" said Thal miserably. \"The man Derec, from\nWalden, had thrown a bomb at you. You seemed to be dead. But Don Loris\nwas not sure. He fretted, as he does. He wished to send someone to make\nsure. The Lady Fani said; 'I will make sure!' She called me to her and\nsaid, 'Thal, will you fight for me?' And there was Don Loris suddenly\nnodding beside her. So I said, 'Yes, my Lady Fani.' Then she said;\n'Thank you. I am troubled by Bron Hoddan.' So what could I do? She said\nthe same thing to each of us, and each of us had to say that he would\nfight for her. To each she said that she was troubled by you. Then Don\nLoris sent us out to look at your body. And now we are disgraced!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan's mouth opened and closed and opened again. He remembered this\nitem of Darthian etiquette. If a girl asked a man if he would fight for\nher, and he agreed, then within a day and a night he had to fight the\nman she sent him to fight, or else he was disgraced. And disgrace on\nDarth meant that the shamed man could be plundered or killed by anybody\nwho chose to do so, but he would be hanged by indignant authority if he\nresisted. It was a great deal worse than outlawry. It included scorn and\ncontempt and opprobrium. It meant dishonor and humiliation and admitted\ndegradation. A disgraced man was despicable in his own eyes. And Hoddan\nhad kidnaped these men who'd been forced to engage themselves to fight\nhim, and if they killed him they would obviously die in space, and if\nthey didn't they'd be ashamed to stay alive. The moral tone on Darth was\nprobably not elevated, but etiquette was a force.\n\nHoddan thought it over. He looked up suddenly.\n\n\"Some of them,\" he said wryly, \"probably figure there's nothing to do\nbut go through with it, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Thal dismally. \"Then we will all die.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Hoddan. \"The obligation is to fight. If you fail to kill\nme, that's not your fault, is it? If you're conquered, you're in the\nclear?\"\n\nThal said miserably:\n\n\"True. Too true! When a man is conquered he is conquered. His conqueror\nmay plunder him, when the matter is finished, or he can spare him, when\nhe may never fight his conqueror again.\"\n\n\"Draw your knife,\" said Hoddan. \"Come at me.\"\n\nThal bewilderedly made the gesture. Hoddan leveled a stun-pistol and\nsaid:\n\n\"_Bzzz._ You're conquered. You came at me with your knife, and I shot\nyou with my stun-pistol. It's all over. Right?\"\n\nThal gaped at him. Then he beamed. He expanded. He gloated. He frisked.\nHe practically wagged a nonexistent tail in his exuberance. He'd been\nshown an out when he could see none.\n\n\"Send in the others one by one,\" said Hoddan. \"I'll take care of them.\nBut Thal--why did the Lady Fani want me killed?\"\n\nThal had no idea, but he did not care. Hoddan did care. He was\nbewildered and inclined to be indignant. A noble friendship like\ntheirs-- A spearman, came in and saluted. Hoddan went through a symbolic\nduel, which was plainly the way the thing would have happened in\nreality. Others came in and went through the same process. Two of them\ndid not quite grasp that it was a ritual, and he had to shoot them in\nthe knife arm. Then he hunted in the ship's supplies for ointment for\nthe blisters that would appear from stun-pistol bolts at such short\nrange. As he bandaged the places, he again tried to find out why the\nLady Fani had tried to get him carved up by the large-bladed knives all\nDarthian gentlemen wore. Nobody could enlighten him.\n\nBut the atmosphere improved remarkably. Since each theoretic fight had\ntaken place in private, nobody was obliged to admit a compromise with\netiquette. Hoddan's followers ceased to brood. They developed huge\nappetites. Those who had been aground on Krim told zestfully of the\nmonstrous hangovers they'd acquired there. It appeared that Hoddan was\nrevered for the size of the benders he enabled his followers to hang on.\n\nBut there remained the fact that the Lady Fani had tried to get him\nmassacred. He puzzled over it. The little yacht sped through space\ntoward Walden. He tried to think how he'd offended Fani. He could think\nof nothing. He set to work on a new electronic setup which would make\nstill another modification of the Lawlor space-drive possible. In the\nothers, groups of electronic components were cut out and others\nsubstituted in rather tricky fashion from the control board. This was\ntrickiest of all. It required the home-made vacuum tube to burn steadily\nwhen in use. But it was a very simple idea. Lawlor drive and landing\ngrid force fields were formed by not dissimilar generators, and ball\nlightning force fields were in the same general family of phenomena.\nSuppose one made the field generator that had to be on a ship if it was\nto drive at all, capable of all those allied, associated, similar force\nfields? If a ship could make the fields that landing grids did, it\nshould be useful to pirates.\n\nHoddan's present errand was neither pure nor simple piracy, but piracy\nit would be. The more he considered the obligation he'd taken on himself\nwhen he helped the emigrant-fleet, the more he doubted that he could\nlift it without long struggle. He was preparing to carry on that\nstruggle for a long time. He'd more or less resigned himself to the\npostponement of his personal desires. Nedda, for example. He wasn't\nquite sure-- Perhaps, after all--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut time passed, and he finished his electronic job. He came out of\noverdrive and made his observations and corrected his course. Finally,\nthere came a moment when the fiery ball which was Walden's sun shone\nbrightly in the vision plates. It writhed and spun in the vast silence\nof emptiness.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHoddan drove to a point still above the five-diameter limit of Walden.\nHe interestedly switched on the control which made his drive-unit\nmanufacture landing-grid-type force fields. He groped for Walden, and\nfelt the peculiar rigidity of the ship when the field took hold\nsomewhere underground. He made an adjustment, and felt the ship respond.\nInstead of pulling a ship to ground, in the setup he'd made, the new\nfields pulled the ground toward the ship. When he reversed the\nadjustment, instead of pushing the ship away to empty space, the new\nfield pushed the planet.\n\nThere was no practical difference, of course. The effect was simply that\nthe space yacht now carried its own landing grid. It could descend\nanywhere and ascend from anywhere without using rockets. Moreover, it\ncould hover without using power.\n\nHoddan was pleased. He took the yacht down to a bare four-hundred-mile\naltitude. He stopped it there. It was highly satisfactory. He made quite\ncertain that everything worked as it should. Then he made a call on the\nspace communicator.\n\n\"Calling ground,\" said Hoddan. \"Calling ground. Pirate ship calling\nground!\"\n\nHe waited for an answer. Now he'd find out the result of very much\neffort and planning. He was apprehensive, of course. There was much\nresponsibility on his shoulders. There was the liner he'd captured and\nlooted and given to the emigrants. There were his followers on the\nyacht, now enthusiastically sharpening their two-foot knife blades in\nexpectation of loot. He owed these people something. For an instant he\nthought of the Lady Fani and wondered how he could make reparation to\nher for whatever had hurt her feelings so she'd try to get his throat\ncut.\n\nA whining, bitterly unhappy voice came to him.\n\n\"_Pirate ship!_\" said the voice plaintively, \"_we received the fleet's\nwarning. Please state where you intend to descend, and we will take\nmeasures to prevent disorder. Repeat, please state where you intend to\ndescend and we will take measures to prevent disorder--_\"\n\nHoddan drew a sharp breath of relief. He named a spot--a high-income\nresidential small city some forty miles from the planetary capital. He\nset his controls for a very gradual descent. He went out to where his\nfollowers made grisly zinging noises where they honed their knives.\n\n\"We'll land,\" said Hoddan sternly, \"in about three-quarters of an hour.\nYou will go ashore and loot in parties of not less than three! Thal, you\nwill be ship guard and receive the plunder and make sure that nobody\nfrom Walden gets on board. You will not waste time committing atrocities\non the population!\"\n\nHe went back to the control room. He turned to general-communication\nbands and listened to the broadcasts down below.\n\n\"_Special Emergency Bulletin!_\" boomed a voice. \"_Pirates are landing in\nthe city of Ensfield, forty miles from Walden City. The population is\ninstructed to evacuate immediately, leaving all action to the police.\nRepeat! The population will evacuate Ensfield, leaving all action to the\npolice. Take nothing with you. Take nothing with you. Leave at once._\"\n\nHoddan nodded approvingly. The voice boomed again:\n\n\"_Special Emergency Bulletin! Pirates are landing ... evacuate ... take\nnothing with you.... Leave at once...._\"\n\nHe turned to another channel. An excited voice barked:\n\n\"_... Seems to be only the one pirate ship, which has been located\nhovering in an unknown manner over Ensfield. We are rushing camera crews\nto the spot and will try to give on-the-spot as-it-happens coverage of\nthe landing of pirates on Walden, their looting of the city of Ensfield,\nand the traffic jams inevitable in the departure of the citizens before\nthe pirate ship touches ground. For background information on this the\nmost exciting event in planetary history, I take you to our editorial\nrooms._\" Another voice took over instantly. \"_It will be remembered that\nsome days since the gigantic pirate fleet then overhead sent down a\ncommunication to the planetary government, warning that single ships\nwould appear to loot and giving notice that any resistance--_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan felt a contented, heart-warming glow. The emigrant fleet had most\nfaithfully carried out its leader's promise to let down a letter from\nspace while in orbit around Walden. The emigrants, of course, did not\nknow the contents of the letter. They would not send anybody down to\nground, because of the temptations to sin in societies other than their\nown. Blithely, and cheerfully, and dutifully, they would give the\nappearance of monstrous piratical strength. They would awe Walden\nthoroughly. And then they'd go on, faithfully leaving similar letters\nand similar impressions on Krim, and Lohala, and Tralee, and Famagusta,\nand throughout the Coalsack stars until the stock of addressed missives\nran out. They would perform this kindly act out of gratitude to Hoddan.\n\nAnd every planet they visited would be left with the impression that the\nfleet overhead was that of bloodthirsty space-marauders who would\npresently send single ships to collect loot--which must be yielded\nwithout resistance. Such looting expeditions were to be looked for\nregularly and must be submitted to under penalty of unthinkable\nretribution from the monster fleet of space.\n\nNow, as the yacht descended on Walden, it represented that mythical but\nimpressive piratical empire of Hoddan's contrivance. He listened with\ngenuine pleasure to the broadcasts. When low enough, he even picked up\nthe pictures of highways thronged with fugitives from the to-be-looted\ntown. He saw Waldenian police directing the traffic of flight. He saw\nother traffic heading toward the city. Walden was the most highly\ncivilized planet in the Nurmi Cluster, and its citizens had had no\nworries at all except about tranquilizers to enable them to stand it.\nWhen something genuinely exciting turned up, they wanted to be there to\nsee it.\n\nThe yacht descended below the clouds. Hoddan turned on an emergency\nflare to make a landing by. Sitting in the control room he saw his own\nship as the broadcast cameras picked it up and relayed it to millions of\nhomes. He was impressed. It was a glaring eye of fierce light,\ndescending deliberately with a dark and mysterious spacecraft behind it.\nHe heard the chattered on-the-spot news accounts of the happening. He\nsaw the people who had not left Ensfield joined by avid visitors. He saw\nall of them held back by police, who frantically shepherded them away\nfrom the area in which the pirates should begin their horrid work.\n\nHoddan even watched pleasurably from his control room as the broadcast\ncameras daringly showed the actual touch-down of the ship; the dramatic\nslow opening of its entrance port: the appearance of authentic pirates\nin the opening, armed to the teeth, bristling ferociously, glaring about\nthem at the here-silent, here-deserted streets of the city left to their\nmercy.\n\nIt was a splendid broadcast. Hoddan would have liked to stay and watch\nall of it. But he had work to do. He had to supervise the pirate raid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was, as it turned out, simple enough. Looting parties of three\npirates each moved skulking about, seeking plunder. Quaking cameramen\ndared to ask them, in shaking voices, to pose for the news cameras. It\nwas a request no Darthian gentleman, even in an act of piracy, could\npossibly refuse. They posed, making pictures of malignant ruffianism.\n\nCommentators, adding informed comment to delectably thrilling pictures,\nobserved that the pirates wore Darthian costume, but observed crisply\nthat this did not mean that Darth as an entity had turned pirate, but\nonly that some of her citizens had joined the pirate fleet.\n\nThe camera crews then asked apologetically if they would permit\nthemselves to be broadcast in the act of looting. Growling savagely for\ntheir public, and occasionally adding even a fiendish \"Ha!\" they\nobliged. The camera crews helped pick out good places to loot for the\nsake of good pictures. The pirates co-operated in fine dramatic style.\nMillions watching vision sets all over the planet shivered in delicious\nhorror as the pirates went about their nefarious enterprise.\n\nPresently the press of onlookers could not be held back by the police.\nThey surrounded the pirates. Some, greatly daring, asked for autographs.\nGirls watched them with round, frightened, fascinated eyes. Younger men\nfound it vastly thrilling to carry burdens of loot back to the pirate\nship for them. Thal complained hoarsely that the ship was getting\noverloaded. Hoddan ordered greater discrimination, but his pirates by\nthis time were in the position of directors rather than looters\nthemselves. Romantic Waldenian admirers smashed windows and brought them\ntreasure, for the reward of a scowling acceptance.\n\nHoddan had to call it off. The pirate ship was loaded. It was then the\ncenter of an agitated, excited, enthusiastic crowd. He called back his\nmen. One party of three did not return. He took two others and fought\nhis way through the mob. He found the trio backed against a wall while\nhysterically adoring girls struggled to seize scraps of their garments\nfor mementos of real, live pirates looting a Waldenian town!\n\nBut Hoddan got them back to the ship, in confusion tending toward the\nblushful. Their clothes were shreds. He fought a way clear for them to\nget into the ship. He fought his way in. Cheers rose from the onlookers.\nHe got the landing port shut only by the help of police who kept pirate\nfans from having their fingers caught in its closing.\n\nThen the piratical space yacht rose swiftly toward the stars.\n\nAn hour later there was barely any diminution of the excitement inside\nthe ship. Darthian gentlemen all, Hoddan's followers still gazed and\nfloated over the plunder tucked everywhere. It crowded the living\nquarters. It threatened to interfere with the astrogation of the ship.\nHoddan came out of the control room and was annoyed.\n\n\"Break it up!\" he snapped. \"Pack that stuff away somewhere! What do you\nthink this is?\"\n\nThal gazed at him abstractedly, not quite able to tear his mind and\nthoughts from this completely unimaginable mass of plunder. Then\nintelligence came into his eyes--as much as could appear there. He\ngrinned suddenly. He slapped his thigh.\n\n\"Boys!\" he gurgled. \"He don't know what we got for him!\"\n\nOne man looked up. Two. They beamed. They got to their feet, dripping\njewelry. Thal went ponderously to one of the two owners' staterooms the\nyacht contained. At the door he turned, expansively.\n\n\"She came to the port,\" he said exuberantly, \"and said we were wearin'\nclothes like they wore on Darth. Did we come from there? I said we did.\nThen she said did we know somebody named Bron Hoddan on Darth? And I\nsaid we did and if she'd step inside the ship she'd meet you. And here\nshe is!\"\n\nHe unfastened the stateroom door, which had been barred from without. He\nopened it. He looked in, and grabbed, and pulled at something. Hoddan\nwent sick with apprehension. He groaned as the something inside the\nstateroom sobbed and yielded.\n\nThal brought Nedda out into the saloon of the yacht. Her nose and eyes\nwere red from terrified weeping. She gazed about her in purest\ndespairing horror. She did not see Hoddan for a moment. Her eyes were\nfilled with the brawny, mustachioed piratical figures who were Darthian\ngentlemen and who grinned at her in what she took for evil gloating.\n\nShe wailed.\n\nHoddan swallowed, with much difficulty, and said sickly:\n\n\"It's all right, Nedda. It was a mistake. Nothing will happen to you.\nYou're quite\"--and he knew with desperate certainty that it was\ntrue--\"safe with me!\"\n\nAnd she was.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nHoddan stopped off at Krim by landing grid, to consult his lawyers. He\nfelt a certain amount of hope of good results from his raid on Walden,\nbut he was desperate about Nedda. Once she was confident of her safety\nunder his protection, she took over the operation of the spaceship. She\ndisplayed an overwhelming saccharinity that was appalling. She was\nsweetness and light among criminals who respectfully did not harm her,\nand she sweetened and lightened the atmosphere of the space yacht until\nHoddan's followers were close to mutiny.\n\n\"It ain't that I mind her being a nice girl,\" one of his mustachioed\nDarthians explained almost tearfully to Hoddan, \"but she wants to make a\nnice girl out of me!\"\n\nHoddan, himself, cringed from her society. He could gladly have put her\nashore on Krim with ample funds to return to Walden. But she was\nprettily, reproachfully helpless. If he did put her ashore, she would\nconfide her kidnaping and the lovely behavior of the pirates until\nnobody would believe in them any more--which would be fatal.\n\nHe went to his lawyers, brooding. The news astounded him. The emigrant\nfleet had appeared over Krim on the way to Walden. Before it appeared,\nHoddan's affairs had been prosperous enough. Right after his previous\nvisit, news had come of the daring piratical raid which captured a ship\noff Walden. This was the liner Hoddan'd brought in to Krim. All\nmerchants and ship owners immediately insured all vessels and goods in\nspace transit at much higher valuations. The risk-insurance stocks\nbought on Hoddan's account had multiplied in value. Obeying his\ninstructions, his lawyers had sold them out and held a pleasing fortune\nin trust for Hoddan.\n\nThen came the fleet over Krim, with its letter threatening planetary\ndestruction if resistance was offered to single ships which would land\nand loot later on. It seemed that all commerce was at the mercy of space\nmarauders. Risk-insurance companies had undertaken to indemnify the\nowners of ships and freight in emptiness. Now that an unprecedented\npirate fleet ranged and doubtless ravaged the skyways, the insurance\ncompanies ought to go bankrupt. Owners of stock in them dumped it at any\nprice to get rid of it. In accordance with Hoddan's instructions,\nthough, his lawyers had faithfully if distastefully bought it in. To use\nup the funds available, they had to buy up not only all the stock of all\nthe risk-insurance companies of Krim, but all stock in all off-planet\ncompanies owned by investors on Krim.\n\nThen time passed, and ships in space arrived unmolested in port. Cargoes\nwere delivered intact. Insurers observed that the risk-insurance\ncompanies had not collapsed and could still pay off if necessary. They\ncontinued their insurance. Risk companies appeared financially sound\nonce more. They had more business than ever, and no more claims than\nusual. Suddenly their stocks went up--or rather, what people were\nwilling to pay for them went up, because Hoddan had forbidden the sale\nof any stock after the pirate fleet appeared.\n\nNow he asked hopefully if he could reimburse the owners of the ship he'd\ncaptured off Walden. He could. Could he pay them even the profit they'd\nhave made between the loss of their ship and the arrival of a\nreplacement? He could. Could he pay off the shippers of Rigellian furs\nand jewelry from the Cetis stars, and the owners of the bulk _melacynth_\nthat had brought so good a price on Krim? He could. In fact, he had. The\ninsurance companies he now owned lock, stock, and barrel had already\npaid the claims on the ship and its cargo, and it would be rather\nofficious to add to that reimbursement.\n\nHoddan was abruptly appalled. He insisted on a bonus being paid,\nregardless, which his lawyers had some trouble finding a legal fiction\nto fit. Then he brooded over his position. He wasn't a business man. He\nhadn't expected to make out so well. He'd thought to have to labor for\nyears, perhaps, to make good the injury he'd done the ship owners and\nmerchants in order to help the emigrants from Colin. But it was all\ndone, and here he was with a fortune and the framework of a burgeoning\nfinancial empire. He didn't like it.\n\nGloomily, he explained matters to his attorneys. They pointed out that\nhe had a duty, an obligation, from the nature of his unexpected success.\nIf he let things go, now, the currently thriving business of risk\ninsurance would return to its former unimportance. His companies had\ntaken on extra help. More bookkeepers and accountants worked for him\nthis week than last. More mail clerks, secretaries, janitors and\nscrubwomen. Even more vice presidents! He would administer a serious\nblow to the economy of Krim if he caused a slackening of employment by\nletting his companies go to pot. A slackening of employment would cause\na drop in retail trade, an increase in inventories, a depression in\nindustry....\n\nHoddan thought gloomily of his grandfather. He'd written to the old\ngentleman and the emigrant fleet would have delivered the letter. He\ncouldn't disappoint his grandfather!\n\nHe morbidly accepted his attorneys' advice, and they arranged\nimmediately to take over the forty-first as well as the forty-second\nand-third floors of the building their offices were in. Commerce would\nmarch on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Hoddan headed for Darth. He had to return his crew, and there was\nsomething else. Several something elses. He arrived in that solar-system\nand put his yacht in a search-orbit, listening for the call-signal the\nspaceboat should give for him to home on. He found it, deep within the\ngravity-field of Darth. He maneuvered to come alongside, and there was\nblinding light everywhere. Alarms rang. Lights went out. Instruments\nregistered impossibilities, the rockets fired crazily, and the whole\nship reeled. Then a voice roared out of the communicator:\n\n\"_Stand and deliver! Surrender and y'll be allowed to go to ground. But\nif y'even hesitate I'll hull ye and heave ye out to space without a\nspacesuit!_\"\n\nHoddan winced. Stray sparks had flown about everywhere inside the space\nyacht. A ball lightning bolt, even of only warning size, makes things\nuncomfortable when it strikes. Hoddan's fingers tingled as if they'd\nbeen asleep. He threw on the transmitter switch and said annoyedly:\n\n\"Hello, grandfather. This is Bron. Have you been waiting for me long?\"\n\nHe heard his grandfather swear disgustedly. Not long later, a badly\nbattered, blackened, scuffed old spacecraft came rolling up on\nrocket-impulse and stopped with a billowing of rocket fumes. Hoddan\nthrew a switch and used the landing grid field he'd used on Walden in\nanother fashion. The ships came together with fine precision,\nlifeboat-tube to lifeboat-tube. He heard his grandfather swear in\namazement.\n\n\"That's a little trick I worked out, grandfather,\" said Hoddan into the\ntransmitter. \"Come aboard. I'll pass it on.\"\n\nHis grandfather presently appeared, scowling and suspicious. His eyes\nshrewdly examined everything, including the loot tucked in every\navailable space. He snorted.\n\n\"All honestly come by,\" said Hoddan morbidly. \"It seems I've got a\nlicense to steal. I'm not sure what to do with it.\"\n\nHis grandfather stared at a placard on the wall. It said archly:\n\"_Remember! A Lady is Present!_\" Nedda had put it up.\n\n\"Hm-m-m!\" said his grandfather. \"What's a woman doing on a pirate ship?\nThat's what your letter talked about!\"\n\n\"They get on,\" said Hoddan, wincing, \"like mice. You've had mice on a\nship, haven't you? Come in the control room and I'll explain.\"\n\nHe did explain, up to the point where his arrangements to pay back for a\nship and cargo he'd given away turned into a runaway success, and now he\nwas responsible for the employment of innumerable bookkeepers and clerks\nand such in the insurance companies he'd come to own. There was also the\nfact that as the emigrant fleet went on, some fifty more planets in all\nwould require the attention of pirate ships from time to time, or there\nwould be disillusionment and injury to the economic system.\n\n\"Organization,\" said his grandfather, \"does wonders for a tender\nconscience like you've got. What else?\"\n\nHoddan explained the matter of his Darthian crew. Don Loris might\naffect to consider them disgraced because they hadn't cut his throat.\nHoddan had to take care of the matter. And there was Nedda.... Fani came\ninto the story somehow, too. Hoddan's grandfather grunted, at the end.\n\n\"We'll go down and talk to this Don Loris,\" he said pugnaciously. \"I've\ndealt with his kind before. While we're down, your Cousin Oliver'll take\na look at this new grid-field job. We'll put it on my ship. Hm-m-m--how\nabout the time down below? Never land long after daybreak. Early in the\nmorning, people ain't at their best.\"\n\nHoddan looked at Darth, rotating deliberately below him.\n\n\"It's not too late, sir,\" he said. \"Will you follow me down?\"\n\nHis grandfather nodded briskly, took another comprehensive look at the\nloot from Walden, and crawled back through the tube to his own ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo it was not too long after dawn, in that time-zone, when a sentry on\nthe battlements of Don Loris' castle felt a shadow over his head. He\njumped a foot and stared upward. Then his hair stood up on end and\nalmost threw his steel helmet off. He stared, unable to move a muscle.\n\nThere was a ship above him. It was not a large ship, but he could not\njudge of such matters. It was not supported by rockets. It should have\nbeen falling horribly to smash him under its weight. It wasn't. Instead,\nit floated on with very fine precision, like a ship being landed by\ngrid, and settled delicately to the ground some fifty yards from the\nbase of the castle wall.\n\nImmediately thereafter there was a muttering roar. It grew to a howl--a\nbellow; it became thunder. It increased from that to a noise so\nstupendous that it ceased altogether to be heard, and was only felt as a\ndeep-toned battering at one's chest. When it ended there was a second\nship resting in the middle of a very large scorched place close by the\nfirst.\n\nNeither of these ships was a spaceboat. The silently landed vessel,\nwhich was the smaller of the two, was several times the sizes of the\nonly spacecraft ever seen on Darth outside the spaceport. Its design was\nsomehow suggestive of a yacht. The other, larger, ship was blunt and\nsoiled and space-worn, with patches on its plating here and there.\n\nA landing ramp dropped down from the battered craft. It neatly spanned\nthe scorched and still-smoking patch of soil. A port opened. Men came\nout, following a jaunty small figure with belligerent gray whiskers.\nThey dragged an enigmatic object behind them.\n\nHoddan came out of the yacht. His grandfather said waspishly:\n\n\"This the castle?\"\n\nHe waved at the massive pile of cut gray stone, with walls twenty feet\nthick and sixty high.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hoddan.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" snorted his grandfather. \"Looks flimsy to me!\" He waved his\nhand again. \"You remember your cousins.\"\n\nFamiliar, matter-of-fact nods came from the men of the battered ship.\nHoddan hadn't seen any of them for years, but they were his kin. They\nwore commonplace, workaday garments, but carried weapons slung\nnegligently over their shoulders. They dragged the cryptic object behind\nthem without particular formation or apparent discipline, but somehow\nthey looked capable.\n\nHoddan and his grandfather strolled to the castle gate, their companions\na little to their rear. They came to the gate. Nothing happened. Nobody\nchallenged. There was the feel of peevish refusal to associate with\npersons who landed in spaceships.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Shall we hail?\" asked Hoddan.\n\n\"Nah!\" snorted his grandfather. \"I know his kind! Make him make the\nadvances.\" He waved to his descendents. \"Open it up.\"\n\nSomebody casually pulled back a cover and reached in and threw switches.\n\n\"Found a power broadcast unit,\" grunted Hoddan's grandfather, \"on a ship\nwe took. Hooked it to the ship's space-drive. When y'can't use the\nspace-drive, you still got power. Your Cousin Oliver whipped this thing\nup to use it.\"\n\nThe enigmatic object made a spiteful noise. The castle gate shuddered\nand fell halfway from its hinges. The thing made a second noise. Stones\nsplintered and began to collapse. Hoddan admired. Three more unpleasing\nbut not violently loud sounds. Half the wall on either side of the gate\nwas rubble, collapsing partly inside and partly outside the castle's\nproper boundary.\n\nFigures began to wave hysterically from the battlements. Hoddan's\ngrandfather yawned slightly.\n\n\"I always like to talk to people,\" he observed, \"when they're worryin'\nabout what I'm likely to do to them, instead of what maybe they can do\nto me.\"\n\nFigures appeared on the ground level. They'd come out of a sally port to\none side. They were even extravagantly cordial when Hoddan's grandfather\nadmitted that it might be convenient to talk over his business inside\nthe castle, where there would be an easy-chair to sit in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently they sat beside the fireplace in the great hall. Don Loris,\njittering, shivered next to Hoddan's grandfather. The Lady Fani\nappeared, icy-cold and defiant. She walked with frigid dignity to a\nplace beside her father. Hoddan's grandfather regarded her with a\nwicked, estimating gaze.\n\n\"Not bad!\" he said brightly. \"Not bad at all!\" Then he turned to Hoddan.\n\"Those retainers coming?\"\n\n\"On the way,\" said Hoddan. He was not happy. The Lady Fani had passed\nher eyes over him exactly as if he did not exist.\n\nThere was a murmurous noise. The dozen spearmen came marching into the\ngreat hall. They carried loot. It dripped on the floor and they blandly\nignored such things as stray golden coins rolling off away from them.\nStay-at-home inhabitants of the castle gazed at them in joyous\nwonderment.\n\nNedda came with them. The Lady Fani made a very slight, almost\nimperceptible movement. Hoddan said desperately:\n\n\"Fani, I know you hate me, though I can't guess why. But here's a thing\nthat ... has to be taken care of! We made a raid on Walden ... that's\nwhere the loot came from ... and my men kidnaped this girl ... her name\nis Nedda ... and brought her on the ship as a present to me ... because\nshe'd admitted that she knew me! Nedda's in an awful fix, Fani! She's\nalone and friendless, and ... somebody has to take care of her! Her\nfather'll come for her eventually, no doubt, but somebody's got to take\ncare of her in the meantime, and I can't do it!\" Hoddan felt hysterical\nat the bare idea. \"I can't!\"\n\nThe Lady Fani looked at Nedda. And Nedda wore the brave look of a girl\nso determinedly sweet that nobody could possibly bear it.\n\n\"I'm ... very sorry,\" said Nedda bravely, \"that I've been the cause of\npoor Bron turning pirate and getting into such dreadful trouble. I cry\nover it every night before I go to sleep. He treated me as if I were his\nsister, and the other men were so gentle and respectful that I ... I\nthink it will break my heart when they are punished. When I think of\nthem being executed with all that dreadful, hopeless formality--\"\n\n\"On Darth,\" said the Lady Fani practically, \"we're not very formal about\nsuch things. Just cutting somebody's throat is usually enough. But he\ntreated you like a sister, did he? Thal?\"\n\nThal swallowed. He'd been beaming a moment before, with his arms full of\nsilver plate, jewelry, laces, and other bits of booty from the town of\nEnsfield. But now he said desperately:\n\n\"Yes, Lady Fani. But not the way I'd've treated my sister. My sisters,\nLady Fani, bit me when they were little, slapped me when they were\nbigger, and scorned me when I grew up. I'm fond of 'em! But if one of my\nsisters'd ever lectured me because I wasn't refined, or shook a finger\nat me because I wasn't gentlemanly-- Lady Fani, I'd've strangled her!\"\n\nThere was a certain gleam in the Lady Fani's eye as she said warmly to\nHoddan:\n\n\"Of course I'll take care of the poor thing! I'll let her sleep with my\nmaids and I'm sure one of them can spare clothes for her to wear, and\nI'll take care of her until a space liner comes along and she can be\nshipped back to her family. And you can come to see her whenever you\nplease, to make sure she's all right!\"\n\nHoddan's eyes tended to grow wild. His grandfather cleared his throat\nloudly. Hoddan said doggedly:\n\n\"You, Fani, asked each of my men if they'd fight for you. They said yes.\nYou sent them to cut my throat. They didn't. But they're not disgraced!\nI want that clear! They're good men! They're not disgraced for failing\nto assassinate me!\"\n\n\"Of course they aren't,\" conceded the Lady Fani sweetly. \"Whoever heard\nof such a thing?\"\n\nHoddan wiped his forehead. Don Loris opened his mouth fretfully.\nHoddan's grandfather forestalled him.\n\n\"You've heard about that big pirate fleet that's been floating around\nthese parts? Eh? It's my grandson's. I run a squadron of it for him.\nWonderful boy, my grandson! Bloodthirsty crews on those ships, but they\nlove that boy!\"\n\n\"Very--\" Don Loris caught his breath. \"Very interesting.\"\n\n\"He likes your men,\" confided Hoddan's grandfather. \"Used them twice.\nSays they make nice, well-behaved pirates. He's going to give them\nstun-pistols and cannon like the one that smashed your gate. Only men on\nDarth with guns like that! Seize the spaceport and put in power\nbroadcast, and make sure nobody else gets stun-weapons. Run the country.\nYour men'll love it. Love that boy, too! Follow him anywhere. Loot.\"\n\nDon Loris quivered. It was horribly plausible. He'd had the scheme of\nthe only stun-weapon-armed force on Darth, himself. He knew his men\ntended to revere Hoddan because of the plunder his followers seemed\nalways to acquire. Don Loris was in a very, very uncomfortable\nsituation. Bored men from the battered spacecraft stood about his great\nhall. They were unimpressed. He knew that they, at least, were casually\nsure that they could bring his castle down about his ears in minutes if\nthey chose.\n\n\"But ... if my men--\" Don Loris quavered. \"What about me?\"\n\n\"Minor problem,\" said Hoddan's grandfather blandly. \"The usual thing\nwould be _pfft!_ Cut your throat.\" He rose. \"Decide that later, no\ndoubt. Yes, Bron?\"\n\n\"I've brought back my men,\" growled Hoddan, \"and Nedda's taken care of.\nWe're through here.\"\n\nHe headed abruptly for the great hall's farthest door. His grandfather\nfollowed him briskly, and the negligent, matter-of-fact armed men who\nwere mostly Hoddan's first and second cousins came after them. Outside\nthe castle, Hoddan said angrily:\n\n\"Why did you tell such a preposterous story, grandfather?\"\n\n\"It's not preposterous,\" said his grandfather. \"Sounds like fun, to me!\nYou're tired now, Bron. Lots of responsibilities and such. Take a rest.\nYou and your Cousin Oliver get together and fix those new gadgets on my\nship. I'll take the other boys for a run over to this spaceport town.\nThe boys need a run ashore, and there might be some loot. Your\ngrandmother's fond of homespun. I'll try to pick some up for her.\"\n\nHoddan shrugged. His grandfather was a law unto himself. Hoddan saw his\ncousins bringing horses from the castle stables, and a very casual group\nwent riding away as if on a pleasure excursion. As a matter of fact, it\nwas. Thal guided them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the rest of that morning and part of the afternoon Hoddan and his\nCousin Oliver worked at the battered ship's Lawlor drive. Hoddan was\npleased with his cousin's respect for his device. He unfeignedly admired\nthe cannon his cousin had designed. Presently they reminisced about\ntheir childhood. It was pleasant to renew family ties like this.\n\nThe riders came back about sunset. There were extra horses, with loads.\nThere were cheerful shoutings. His grandfather came into Hoddan's ship.\n\n\"Brought back some company,\" he said. \"Spaceliner landed while we were\nthere. Friend of yours on it. Congenial fellow, Bron. Thinks well of\nyou, too!\"\n\nA large figure followed his grandfather in. A large figure with\nsnow-white hair. The amiable and relaxed Interstellar Ambassador to\nWalden.\n\n\"Hard-gaited horses, Hoddan,\" he said wryly. \"I want a chair and a\ndrink. I traveled a good many light-years to see you, and it wasn't\nnecessary after all. I've been talking to your grandfather.\"\n\n\"Glad to see you, sir,\" said Hoddan reservedly.\n\nHis Cousin Oliver brought glasses, and the Ambassador buried his nose in\nhis and said in satisfaction:\n\n\"A-a-ah! That's good! Capable man, your grandfather. I watched him loot\nthat town. Beautifully professional job! He got some homespun sheets for\nyour grandmother. But about you.\"\n\nHoddan sat down. His grandfather puffed and was silent. His cousins\neffaced themselves. The Ambassador waved a hand.\n\n\"I started here,\" he observed, \"because it looked to me like you were\nrunning wild. That spacefleet, now ... I know something of your ability.\nI thought you'd contrived some way to fake it. I knew there couldn't be\nsuch a fleet. Not really! That was a sound job you did with the\nemigrants, by the way. Most praiseworthy! And the point was that if you\nran hogwild with a faked fleet, sooner or later the Space Patrol would\nhave to cut you down to size. And you were doing much too good work to\nbe stopped!\"\n\nHoddan blinked.\n\n\"Satisfaction,\" said the Ambassador, \"is well enough. But satiety is\ndeath. Walden was dying on its feet. Nobody could imagine a greater\nsatisfaction than curling up with a good tranquilizer! You've ended\nthat! I left Walden the day after your Ensfield raid. Young men were\nalready trying to grow mustaches. The textile mills were making colored\nfelt for garments. Jewelers were turning out stun-gun pins for\nornaments, Darthian knives for brooches, and the song writers had eight\nnew tunes on the air about pirate lovers, pirate queens, and dark ships\nthat roam the lanes of night. Three new vision-play series were to start\nthat same night with space-piracy as their theme, and one of them\nclaimed to be based on your life. Better make them pay for that, Hoddan!\nIn short, Walden had rediscovered the pleasure to be had by taking pains\nto make a fool of one's self. People who watched that raid on\nvisionscreens had thrills they'd never swap for tranquilizers! And the\nones who actually mixed in with the pirate raiders-- You deserve well of\nthe republic, Hoddan!\"\n\nHoddan said, \"Hm-m-m,\" because there was nothing else to be said.\n\n\"Now, your grandfather and I have canvassed the situation thoroughly!\nThis good work must be continued. Diplomatic Service has been worried\nall along the line. Now we've something to work up. Your grandfather\nwill expand his facilities and snatch ships, land and loot, and keep\npiracy flying. Your job is to carry on the insurance business. The ships\nthat will be snatched will be your ships, of course. No interference\nwith legitimate commerce. The landing-raids will be paid for by the\ninterplanetary piracy-risk insurance companies--you. In time you'll\nprobably have to get writers to do scripts for them, but not right away.\nYou'll continue to get rich, but there's no harm in that so long as you\nre-introduce romance and adventure and derring-do to a galaxy headed for\ndecline. Savages will not invent themselves if there are plenty of\nheroic characters--of your making!--to slap them down!\"\n\nHoddan said painfully:\n\n\"I like working on electronic gadgets. My cousin Oliver and I have some\nthings we want to work on together.\"\n\nHis grandfather snorted. One of the cousins came in from outside the\nyacht. Thal followed him, glowing. He'd reported the looting of the\nspaceport town, and Don Loris had gone into a tantrum of despair because\nnobody seemed able to make headway against these strangers. Now he'd\nturned about and issued a belated invitation to Hoddan and his\ngrandfather and their guest the Interstellar Ambassador--of whom he'd\nlearned from Thal--to dinner at the castle. They could bring their own\nguards.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoddan would have refused, but the Ambassador and his grandfather were\ninsistent. Ultimately he found himself seated drearily at a long table\nin a stone-walled room lighted by very smoky torches. Don Loris,\njittering, displayed a sort of professional conversational charm. He was\nmaking an urgent effort to overcome the bad effect of past actions by\nconversational brilliance. The Lady Fani sat quietly with jewels at her\nthroat. She looked most often at her plate. The talk of the oldsters\nbecame profound. They talked administration. They talked practical\npolitics. They talked economics.\n\nThe Lady Fani looked very bored as the talk went on after the meal was\nover. Don Loris said brightly, to her:\n\n\"My dear we must be tedious! Young Hoddan looks uninterested, too. Why\ndon't you two walk on the battlements and talk about such things as\npersons your age find interesting?\"\n\nHoddan rose, gloomily. The Lady Fani, with a sigh of polite resignation,\nrose to accompany him. The Ambassador said suddenly:\n\n\"Hoddan! I forgot to tell you! They found out what killed that man\noutside the power station!\" When Hoddan showed no comprehension, the\nAmbassador explained, \"The man your friend Derec thought was killed by\ndeathrays. It develops that he'd gotten a terrific load on--drunk, you\nknow--and climbed a tree to escape the pink, purple, and green _duryas_\nhe thought were chasing him to gore him. He climbed too high, a branch\nbroke, and he fell and was killed. I'll take it up with the court when I\nget back to Walden. No reason to lock you up any more, you know. You\nmight even sell the Power Board on using your receptor, now!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Hoddan politely. He added, \"Don Loris has that Derec and\na cop from Walden here now. Tell them that and they may go home.\"\n\nHe accompanied the Lady Fani to the battlements. The stars were very\nbright. They strolled. Remembering his Darthians, he felt very\nunpopular.\n\n\"What was that the Ambassador told you?\" she asked.\n\nHe explained without zest. He added morbidly that it didn't matter. He\ncould go back to Walden now, and if the Ambassador was right he could\neven accomplish things in electronics there. But he wasn't interested.\nIt was odd that he'd once thought such things would make him happy.\n\n\"I thought,\" said the Lady Fani, in gentle melancholy, \"that I would be\nhappier with you dead. You had made me very angry. No, no matter how!\nBut I found it was not so.\"\n\nHoddan fumbled for her meaning. It wasn't quite an apology for trying to\nget him killed. But at least it was a disclaimer of future intentions in\nthat direction.\n\n\"And speaking of happiness,\" she added in a different tone, \"this\nNedda....\" He shuddered, and she said: \"I talked to her. So then I sent\nfor Ghek. We're on perfectly good terms again, you know. I introduced\nhim to Nedda. She was vanilla ice cream with meringue and maple syrup on\nit. He loved it! She gazed at him with pretty sadness and told him how\nterrible it was of him to kidnap me. He said humbly that he'd never had\nher ennobling influence nor dreamed that she existed. And she loved\nthat! They go together like strawberries and cream! I had to leave, or\nstop being a lady. I think I made a match.\"\n\nThen she said tranquilly:\n\n\"But seriously, you ought to be perfectly happy. You've everything you\never said you wanted, except a delightful girl to marry.\"\n\nHoddan squirmed.\n\n\"We're old friends,\" said Fani kindly, \"and you did me a great favor\nonce. I'll return it. I'll round up some really delightful girls for you\nto look over.\"\n\n\"I'm leaving,\" said Hoddan, alarmed.\n\n\"The only thing is-- I don't know what type you like. Nedda isn't it.\"\n\nHoddan shuddered.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Fani. \"What type would you say I was?\"\n\n\"Delightful,\" said Hoddan hoarsely.\n\nThe Lady Fani stopped and looked up at him. She said approvingly:\n\n\"I hoped that word would occur to you one day. Er ... what does a man\nusually do when he discovers a girl is delightful?\"\n\nHoddan thought it over. He started. He put his arms around her with\nsingularly little skill. He kissed her, at first as if amazed at\nhimself, and then with enthusiasm.\n\nThere were scraping sounds on the stone nearby. Footsteps. Don Loris\nappeared, gazing uncertainly about.\n\n\"Fani!\" he said plaintively. \"Hoddan? Our guests are going to the\nspaceships. I want to speak privately to Hoddan.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Hoddan. Don Loris peered blindly about. He kissed Fani\nagain.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" said Don Loris fretfully. \"I've made some\nmistakes, my dear boy, and I've given you excellent reason to dislike\nme, but at bottom I've always thought a great deal of you.\nAnd ... ah ... there seems to be only one way in which I can properly\nexpress how much I admire you. Ah-- How would you like to marry my\ndaughter?\"\n\nHoddan looked down at Fani. She did not try to move away.\n\n\"What do you think of the idea, Fani?\" he asked. \"How about marrying me\ntomorrow morning?\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" said Fani indignantly. \"I wouldn't think of such a\nthing! I couldn't possibly get married before tomorrow afternoon!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n    Transcriber's Notes:\n\n    This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction\n    February, March and April 1959.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
