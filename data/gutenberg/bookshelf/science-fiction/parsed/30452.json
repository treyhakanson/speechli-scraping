The four sat together at the end of a roughly furnished\nand electric-lit living-room, and in that momentary silence there came\nin to them from the outside night the distant pounding of the Atlantic\nupon the beach. It was Randall who first spoke again.\n\n\"To Mars!\" he repeated. \"Have you gone crazy, Milton--or is this some\njoke you've put up with Lanier and Nelson here?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMilton shook his head gravely. \"It is not a joke, Allan. Lanier and I\nare actually going to flash out over the gulf to the planet Mars\nto-night. Nelson must stay here, and since we wanted three to go I\nwired you as the most likely of my friends to make the venture.\"\n\n\"But good God!\" Randall exploded, rising. \"You, Milton, as a physicist\nought to know better. Space-ships and projectiles and all that are but\nfictionists' dreams.\"\n\n\"We are not going in either space-ship or projectile,\" said Milton\ncalmly. And then as he saw his friend's bewilderment he rose and led\nthe way to a door at the room's end, the other three following him\ninto the room beyond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a long laboratory of unusual size in which Randall found\nhimself, one in which every variety of physical and electrical\napparatus seemed represented. Three huge dynamo-motor arrangements\ntook up the room's far end, and from them a tangle of wiring led\nthrough square black condensers and transformers to a battery of great\ntubes. Most remarkable, though, was the object at the room's center.\n\nIt was like a great double cube of dull metal, being in effect two\nmetal cubes each twelve feet square, supported a few feet above the\nfloor by insulated standards. One side of each cube was open, exposing\nthe hollow interiors of the two cubical chambers. Other wiring led\nfrom the big electronic tubes and from the dynamos to the sides of the\ntwo cubes.\n\nThe four men gazed at the enigmatic thing for a time in silence.\nMilton's strong, capable face showed only in its steady eyes what\nfeelings were his, but Lanier's younger countenance was alight with\nexcitement; and so too to some degree was that of Nelson. Randall\nsimply stared at the thing, until Milton nodded toward it.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"is what will flash us out to Mars to-night.\"\n\nRandall could only turn his stare upon the other, and Lanier chuckled.\n\"Can't take it in yet, Randall? Well, neither could I when the idea\nwas first sprung on us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMilton nodded to seats behind them, and as the half-dazed Randall sank\ninto one the physicist faced him earnestly.\n\n\"Randall, there isn't much time now, but I am going to tell you what I\nhave been doing in the last two years on this God-forsaken Maine\ncoast. I have been for those two years in unbroken communication by\nradio with beings on the planet Mars!\n\n\"It was when I still held my physics professorship back at the\nuniversity that I got first onto the track of the thing. I was\nstudying the variation of static vibrations, and in so doing caught\nsteady signals--not static--at an unprecedentedly high wave-length.\nThey were dots and dashes of varying length in an entirely\nunintelligible code, the same arrangement of them being sent out\napparently every few hours.\n\n\"I began to study them and soon ascertained that they could be sent\nout by no station on earth. The signals seemed to be growing louder\neach day, and it suddenly occurred to me that Mars was approaching\nopposition with earth! I was startled, and kept careful watch. On the\nday that Mars was closest the earth the signals were loudest.\nThereafter, as the red planet receded, they grew weaker. The signals\nwere from some being or beings on Mars!\n\n\"At first I was going to give the news to the world, but saw in time\nthat I could not. There was not sufficient proof, and a premature\nstatement would only wreck my own scientific reputation. So I decided\nto study the signals farther until I had irrefutable proof, and to\nanswer them if possible. I came up here and had this place built, and\nthe aerial towers and other equipment I wanted set up. Lanier and\nNelson came with me from the university, and we began our work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Our chief object was to answer those signals, but it proved\nheartbreaking work at first. We could not produce a radio wave of\ngreat enough length to pierce out through earth's insulating layer and\nacross the gulf to Mars. We used all the power of our great\nwindmill-dynamo hook-ups, but for long could not make it. Every few\nhours like clockwork the Martian signals came through. Then at last we\nheard them repeating one of our own signals. We had been heard!\n\n\"For a time we hardly left our instruments. We began the slow and\nalmost impossible work of establishing intelligent communication with\nthe Martians. It was with numbers we began. Earth is the third planet\nfrom the sun and Mars the fourth, so three represented earth and four\nstood for Mars. Slowly we felt our way to an exchange of ideas, and\nwithin months were in steady and intelligent communication with them.\n\n\"They asked us first concerning earth, its climates and seas and\ncontinents, and concerning ourselves, our races and mechanisms and\nweapons. Much information we flashed out to them, the language of our\ncommunication being English, the elements, of which they had learned,\nwith a mixture of numbers and symbolical dot-dash signals.\n\n\"We were as eager to learn about them. They were somewhat reticent, we\nfound, concerning their planet and themselves. They admitted that\ntheir world was a dying one and that their great canals were to make\nlife possible on it, and also admitted that they were different in\nbodily form from ourselves.\n\n\"They told us finally that communication like this was too\nineffective to give us a clear picture of their world, or vice versa.\nIf we could visit Mars, and then they visit earth, both worlds would\nbenefit by the knowledge of the other. It seemed impossible to me,\nthough I was eager enough for it. But the Martians said that while\nspaceships and the like were impossible, there was a way by which\nliving beings could flash from earth to Mars and back by radio waves,\neven as our signals flashed!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRandall broke in in amazement. \"By radio!\" he exclaimed, and Milton\nnodded.\n\n\"Yes, so they said, nor did the idea of sending matter by radio seem\ntoo insane, after all. We send sound, music by radio waves across half\nthe world from our broadcasting stations. We send light, pictures,\nacross the world from our television stations. We do that by changing\nthe wave length of the light-vibrations to make them radio vibrations,\nflashing them out thus over the world, to receivers which alter their\nwave-lengths again and change them back into light-vibrations.\n\n\"Why then could not matter be sent in the same way? Matter, it has\nbeen long believed, is but another vibration of the ether, like light\nand radiant heat and radio vibrations and the like, having a lower\nwave-length than any of the others. Suppose we take matter and by\napplying electrical force to it change its wave-length, step it up to\nthe wave-length of radio vibrations? Then those vibrations can be\nflashed forth from the sending station to a special receiver that will\nstep them down again from radio vibrations to matter vibrations. Thus\nmatter, living or non-living, could be flashed tremendous distances in\na second!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This the Martians told us, and said they would set up a\nmatter-transmitter and receiver on Mars and would aid and instruct us\nso that we could set up a similar transmitter and receiver here. Then\npart of us could be flashed out to Mars as radio vibrations by the\ntransmitter, and in moments would have flashed across the gulf to the\nred planet and would be transformed back from radio vibrations to\nmatter-vibrations by the receiver awaiting us there!\n\n\"Naturally we agreed enthusiastically to build such a\nmatter-transmitter and receiver, and then, with their instructions\nsignalled to us constantly, started the work. Weeks it took, but at\nlast, only yesterday, we finished it. The thing's two cubical chambers\nare one for the transmitting of matter and the other for its\nreception. At a time agreed on yesterday we tested the thing, placing\na guinea pig in the transmitting chamber and turning on the actuating\nforce. Instantly the animal vanished, and in moments came a signal\nfrom the Martians saying that they had received it unharmed in their\nreceiving chamber.\n\n\"Then we tested it the other way, they sending the same guinea pig to\nus, and in moments it flashed into being in our receiving chamber. Of\ncourse the step-down force in the receiving chamber had to be in\noperation, since had it not been at that moment the radio-vibrations\nof the animal would have simply flashed on endlessly in endless space.\nAnd the same would happen to any of us were we flashed forth and no\nreceiving chamber turned on to receive us.\n\n\"We signalled the Martians that all tests were satisfactory, and told\nthem that on the next night at exactly midnight by our time we would\nflash out ourselves on our first visit to them. They have promised to\nhave their receiving chamber operating to receive us at that moment,\nof course, and it is my plan to stay there twenty-four hours,\ngathering ample proofs of our visit, and then flash back to earth.\n\n\"Nelson must stay here, not only to flash us forth to-night, but above\nall to have the receiving chamber operating to receive us at the\ndestined moment twenty-four hours later. The force required to\noperate it is too great to use for more than a few minutes at a time,\nso it is necessary above all that that force be turned on and the\nreceiving chamber ready for us at the moment we flash back. And since\nNelson must stay, and Lanier and I wanted another, we wired you,\nRandall, in the hope that you would want to go with us on this\nventure. And do you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Milton's question hung, Randall drew a long breath. His eyes were\non the two great cubical chambers, and his brain seemed whirling at\nwhat he had heard. Then he was on his feet with the others.\n\n\"Go? Could you keep me from going? Why, man, it's the greatest\nadventure in history!\"\n\nMilton grasped his hand, as did Lanier, and then the physicist shot a\nglance at the square clock on the wall. \"Well, there's little enough\ntime left us,\" he said, \"for we've hardly an hour before midnight, and\nat midnight we must be in that transmitting chamber for Nelson to send\nus flashing out!\"\n\nRandall could never recall but dimly afterward how that tense hour\npassed. It was an hour in which Milton and Nelson went with anxious\nfaces and low-voiced comments from one to another of the pieces of\napparatus in the room, inspecting each carefully, from the great\ndynamos to the transmitting and receiving chambers, while Lanier\nquickly got out and made ready the rough khaki suits and equipment\nthey were to take.\n\nIt lacked but a quarter-hour of midnight when they had finally donned\nthose suits, each making sure that he was in possession of the small\npersonal kit Milton had designated. This included for each a heavy\nautomatic, a small supply of concentrated foods, and a small case of\ndrugs chosen to counteract the rarer atmosphere and lesser gravity\nwhich Milton had been warned to expect on the red planet. Each had\nalso a strong wrist-watch, the three synchronized exactly with the\nbig laboratory clock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen they had finished checking up on this equipment the clock's\nlonger hand pointed almost to the figure twelve, and the physicist\ngestured expressively toward the transmitting chamber. Lanier, though,\nstrode for a moment to one of the laboratory's doors and flung it\nopen. As Randall gazed out with him they could see far out over the\ntossing sea, dimly lit by the great canopy of the summer stars\noverhead. Right at the zenith among those stars shone brightest a\ncrimson spark.\n\n\"Mars,\" said Lanier, his voice a half-whisper. \"And they're waiting\nout there for us now--out there where we'll be in minutes!\"\n\n\"And if they shouldn't be waiting--their receiving chamber not\nready--\"\n\nBut Milton's calm voice came across the room to them: \"Zero hour,\" he\nsaid, stepping up into the big transmitting chamber.\n\nLanier and Randall slowly followed, and despite himself a slight\nshudder shook the latter's body as he stepped into the mechanism that\nin moments would send him flashing out through the great void as\nimpalpable ether-vibrations. Milton and Lanier were standing silent\nbeside him, their eyes on Nelson, who stood watchfully now at the big\nswitchboard beside the chambers, his own gaze on the clock. They saw\nhim touch a stud, and another, and the hum of the great dynamos at the\nroom's end grew loud as the swarming of angry bees.\n\nThe clock's longer hand was crawling over the last space to cover the\nsmaller hand. Nelson turned a knob and the battery of great glass\ntubes broke into brilliant white light, a crackling coming from them.\nRandall saw the clock's pointer clicking over the last divisions, and\nas he saw Nelson grip a great switch there came over him a wild\nimpulse to bolt from the transmitting chamber. But then as his\nthoughts whirled maelstromlike there came a clang from the clock and\nNelson flung down the switch in his grasp. Blinding light seemed to\nbreak from all the chamber onto the three; Randall felt himself hurled\ninto nothingness by forces titanic, inconceivable, and then knew no\nmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRandall came back to consciousness with a humming sound in his ears\nand with a sharp pain piercing his lungs at every breath. He felt\nhimself lying on a smooth hard surface, and heard the humming stop and\nbe succeeded by a complete silence. He opened his eyes, drawing\nhimself to his feet as Milton and Lanier were doing, and stared about\nhim.\n\nHe was standing with his two friends inside a cubical metal chamber\nalmost exactly the same as the one they had occupied in Milton's\nlaboratory a few moments before. But it was not the same, as their\nfirst astounded glance out through its open side told them.\n\nFor it was not the laboratory that lay around them, but a vast\nconelike hall that seemed to Randall's dazed eyes of dimensions\nillimitable. Its dull-gleaming metal walls slanted up for a thousand\nfeet over their heads, and through a round aperture at the tip far\nabove and through great doors in the walls came a thin sunlight. At\nthe center of the great hall's circular floor stood the two cubical\nchambers in one of which the three were, while around the chambers\nwere grouped masses of unfamiliar-looking apparatus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Randall's untrained eyes it seemed electrical apparatus of very\nstrange design, but neither he nor Milton nor Lanier paid it but small\nattention in that first breathless moment. They were gazing in\nfascinated horror at the scores of creatures who stood silent amid the\napparatus and at its switches, gazing back at them. Those creatures\nwere erect and roughly man-like in shape, but they were not human\nmen. They were--the thought blasted to Randall's brain in that\nhorror-filled moment--crocodile-men.\n\nCrocodile-men! It was only so that he could think of them in that\nmoment. For they were terribly like great crocodile shapes that had\nlearned in some way to carry themselves erect upon their hinder limbs.\nThe bodies were not covered with skin, but with green bony plates. The\nlimbs, thick and taloned at their paw-ends, seemed greater in size and\nstronger, the upper two great arms and the lower two the legs upon\nwhich each walked, while there was but the suggestion of a tail. But\nthe flat head set on the neckless body was most crocodilian of all,\nwith great fanged, hinged jaws projecting forward, and with dark\nunwinking eyes set back in bony sockets.\n\nEach of the creatures wore on his torso a gleaming garment like a coat\nof metal scales, with metal belts in which some had shining tubes.\nThey were standing in groups here and there about the mechanisms, the\nnearest group at a strange big switch-panel not a half-dozen feet from\nthe three men. Milton and Lanier and Randall returned in a tense\nsilence the unwinking stare of the monstrous beings around them.\n\n\"The Martians!\" Lanier's horror-filled exclamation was echoed in the\nnext instant by Randall's.\n\n\"The Martians! God, Milton! They're not like anything we know--they're\nreptilian!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMilton's hand clutched his shoulder. \"Steady, Randall,\" he muttered.\n\"They're terrible enough, God knows--but remember we must seem just as\ngrotesque to them.\"\n\nThe sound of their voices seemed to break the great hall's spell of\nsilence, and they saw the crocodilian Martians before them turning and\nspeaking swiftly to each other in low hissing speech-sounds that were\nquite unintelligible to the three. Then from the small group nearest\nthem one came forward, until he stood just outside the chamber in\nwhich they were.\n\nRandall felt dimly the momentousness of the moment, in which beings of\nearth and Mars were confronting each other for the first time in the\nsolar system's history. The creature before them opened his great jaws\nand uttered slowly a succession of sounds that for the moment puzzled\nthem, so different were they from the hissing speech of the others,\nthough with the same sibilance of tone. Again the thing repeated the\nsounds, and this time Milton uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"He's speaking to us!\" he cried. \"Trying to speak the English that I\ntaught them in our communication! I caught a word--listen....\"\n\nAs the creature repeated the sounds, Randall and Lanier started to\nhear also vaguely expressed in that hissing voice familiar words:\n\"You--are Milton and--others from--earth?\"\n\nMilton spoke very clearly and slowly to the creature: \"We are those\nfrom earth,\" he said. \"And you are the Martians with whom we have\ncommunicated?\"\n\n\"We are those Martians,\" said the other's hissing voice slowly.\n\"These\"--he waved a taloned paw toward those behind him--\"have charge\nof the matter-transmitter and receiver. I am of our ruler's council.\"\n\n\"Ruler?\" Milton repeated. \"A ruler of all Mars?\"\n\n\"Of all Mars,\" the other said. \"Our name for him would mean in your\nwords the Martian Master. I am to take you to him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMilton turned to the other two with face alight with excitement.\n\"These Martians have some supreme ruler they call the Martian Master,\"\nhe said quickly; \"and we're to go before him. As the first visitors\nfrom earth we're of immense importance here.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the Martian official before them had uttered a hissing\ncall, and in answer to it a long shape of shining metal raced into\nthe vast hall and halted beside them. It was like a fifty-foot\ncentipede of metal, its scores of supporting short legs actuated by\nsome mechanism inside the cylindrical body. There was a\ntransparent-walled control room at the front end of that body, and in\nit a Martian at the controls who snapped open a door from which a\nmetal ladder automatically descended.\n\nThe Martian official gestured with a reptilian arm toward the ladder,\nand Milton and Lanier and Randall moved carefully out of the\ncube-chamber and across the floor to it, each of their steps being\nmade a short leap forward by the lesser gravity of the smaller planet.\nThey climbed up into the centipede-machine's control room, their guide\nfollowing, and then as the door snapped shut, the operator of the\nthing pulled and turned the knob in his grasp and the long machine\nscuttled forward with amazing smoothness and speed.\n\nIn a moment it was out of the building and into the feeble sunlight of\na broad metal-paved street. About them lay a Martian city, seen by\ntheir eager eyes for the first time. It was a city whose structures\nwere giant metal cones like that from which they had just come, though\nnone seemed as large as that titanic one. Throngs of the hideous\ncrocodilian Martians were moving busily to and fro in the streets,\nwhile among them there scuttled and flashed numbers of the\ncentipede-machines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs their strange vehicle raced along, Randall saw that the conelike\nstructures were for the most part divided into many levels, and that\ninside some could be glimpsed ranks of great mechanisms and hurrying\nMartians tending them. Away to their right across the vast forest of\ncones that was the city the sun's little disk was shining, and he\nglimpsed in that direction higher ground covered with a vast tangle of\nbright crimson jungle that sloped upward from a great, half-glimpsed\nwaterway.\n\nThe Martian beside them saw the direction of his gaze and leaned\ntoward him. \"No Martians live there,\" he hissed slowly. \"Martians live\nonly in cities where canals meet.\"\n\n\"Then there's no life in those crimson jungles?\" Randall asked,\nrepeating the question a moment later more slowly.\n\n\"No Martians there, but life--living things,\" the other told him,\nsearching for words. \"But not intelligent, like Martians and you.\"\n\nHe turned to gaze ahead, then pointed. \"The Martian Master's cone,\" he\nhissed.\n\nThe three saw that at the end of the broad metal street down which\ntheir vehicle was racing there loomed another titanic cone-structure,\nfully as large as the mighty one in which they first found themselves.\nAs the centipede-machine swept up to its great door-opening and\nhalted, they descended to the metal paving and then followed their\nreptilian guide through the opening.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey found themselves in a great hall in which scores of the Martians\nwere coming and going. At the hall's end stood a row of what seemed\nguards, Martians grasping shining tubes such as they had already\nglimpsed. These gave way to allow their passage when their conductor\nuttered a hissing order, and then they were moving down a shorter hall\nat whose end also were guards. As these sprang aside before them, a\ngreat door of massive metal they guarded moved softly upward,\ndisclosing a mighty circular hall or room inside. Their crocodilian\nguide turned to them.\n\n\"The hall of the Martian Master,\" he hissed.\n\nThey passed inside with him. The great hall seemed to extend upward to\nthe giant cone's tip, thin light coming down from an opening there.\nUpon the dull metal of its looming walls were running friezes of\nlighter metal, grotesque representations of reptilian shapes that they\ncould but vaguely glimpse. Around the walls stood rank after rank of\nguards.\n\nAt the hall's center was a low dias, and in a semicircle around and\nbehind it stood a half-hundred great crocodilian shapes. Randall\nguessed even at the moment that they were the council of which their\nconductor had named himself a member. But like Milton and Lanier, he\nhad eyes in that first moment only for the dais itself. For on it\nwas--the Martian Master.\n\nRandall heard Milton and Lanier choke with the horror that shook his\nown heart and brain as he gazed. It was not simply another great\ncrocodilian shape that sat upon that dais. It was a monstrous thing\nformed by the joining of three of the great reptilian bodies! Three\ndistinct crocodile-like bodies sitting close together upon a metal\nseat, that had but a single great head. A great, grotesque crocodilian\nhead that bulged backward and to either side, and that rested on the\nthree thick short necks that rose from the triple body! And that head,\nthat triple-bodied thing, was living, its unwinking eyes gazing at the\nthree men!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martian Master! Randall felt his brain reel as he gazed at that\nmind-shattering thing. The Martian Master--this great head with three\nbodies! Reason told Randall, even as he strove for sanity, that the\nthing was but logical, that even on earth biologists had formed\nmultiple-headed creatures by surgery, and that the Martians had done\nso to combine in one great head, one great brain, the brains of three\nbodies. Reason told him that the great triple brain inside that\nbulging head needed the bloodstreams of all three bodies to nourish\nit, must be a giant intellect indeed, one fitted to be the supreme\nMartian Master. But reason could not overcome the horror that choked\nhim as he gazed at the awful thing.\n\nA hissing voice sounding before him made him aware that the Martian\nMaster was speaking.\n\n\"You are the Earth-beings with whom we communicated, and whom we\ninstructed to build a matter-transmitter and receiver on earth?\" the\nslow voice asked. \"You have come safely to Mars by means of that\nstation?\"\n\n\"We have come safely.\" Milton's voice was shaken and he could find no\nother words.\n\n\"That is well. Long had we desired to have such a station built on\nearth, since with it there to flash back and forth between the two\nworlds is easy. You have come, then, to learn of this world and to\ntake back what you learn to your races?\"\n\n\"That is why we came.\" Milton said, more steadily. \"We want to stay\nonly hours on this first visit, and then flash back to earth as we\ncame.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe head's awful eyes seemed to consider them. \"But when do you intend\nto go back?\" its strange voice asked. \"Unless the one at your earth\nstation has its receiver operating at the right moment you will simply\nflash on endlessly as radio waves--will be annihilated.\"\n\nMilton found the courage to smile. \"We started from earth at our\nmidnight exactly, and at midnight exactly twenty-four earth hours\nlater, we are to flash back and the receiver will be awaiting us.\"\n\nThere was silence when he had said that, a silence that seemed to\nRandall's strained mind to have become suddenly tense, sinister. The\ngreat triple-bodied creature before them considered them again, its\neyes moving over them, and when it again spoke the hissing words came\nvery slowly.\n\n\"Twenty-four earth hours,\" it said; \"and then your receiver on earth\nwill be awaiting you. That time we can measure to the moment, and that\nis well. For it is not you three Earth-beings who will flash back to\nearth when that moment comes! It will be Martians, the first of our\nMartian masses who have waited for ages for that moment and who will\nbegin then our conquest of the earth!\n\n\"Yes, Earth-beings, our great plan comes to its end now at last! At\nlast! Age on age, prisoned on this dying, arid world, we have desired\nthe earth that by right of power shall be ours, have sought for ages\nto communicate with its beings. You finally heard us, you hearkened to\nus, you built the matter-transmitting and receiving station on earth\nthat was the one thing needed for our plan. For when the\nmatter-receiver of that station is turned on in twenty-four of your\nhours, and ready to receive matter flashes from here, it will be the\nfirst of our millions who will flash at last to earth!\n\n\"I, the Martian Master, say it. Those first to go shall seize that\nmatter-receiver on earth when first they appear there, shall build\nother and larger receivers, and through them within days all our\nMartian hordes shall have been flashed to earth! Shall have poured out\nover it and conquered with our weapons your weak races of\nEarth-beings, who cannot stand before us, and whose world you have\ndelivered at last into our hands!\"\n\nFor a moment, when the great monster's hissing voice had ceased,\nMilton and Randall and Lanier gazed toward it as though petrified, the\nwhole unearthly scene spinning about them. And then, through the thick\nsilence, the thin sound of Milton's voice:\n\n\"Our world--our earth--delivered to the Martians, and by us! God--no!\"\n\nWith that last cry of agonized comprehension and horror, Milton did\nwhat surely had never any in the great hall expected, leaped onto the\ndais with a single spring toward the Martian Master! Randall heard a\nhundred wild hissing cries break from about him, saw the crocodilian\nforms of guards and council rushing forward even as he and Lanier\nsprang after Milton, and then glimpsed shining tubes levelled from\nwhich brilliant shafts of dazzling crimson light or force were\nstabbing toward them!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Randall the moment that followed was but a split-second flash and\nwhirl of action. As his earthly muscles took him forward with Lanier\nafter Milton in a great leap to the dais, he was aware of the\nbrilliant red rays stabbing behind him closely, and knew that only the\ntremendous size of his leap had taken him past them. In the succeeding\ninstant he was made aware of what he had escaped, for the\nhastily-loosed rays struck squarely a group of three or four Martian\nguards rushing to the dais from the opposite side, and they vanished\nfrom view with a sharp detonation as though clicked out of existence!\n\nRandall was not to know then, that the red rays were ones that\nannihilated matter by neutralizing or damping the matter-vibrations in\nthe ether. But he did know that no more rays were loosed, for by then\nhe and Milton and Lanier were on the dais and were wrapped in a\nhurricane combat with the guards that had rushed between them and the\nMartian Master.\n\nGleaming fangs--great scaled forms--reaching talons--it was all a wild\nphantasmagoria of grotesque forms spinning around him as he struck\nwith all the power of his earthly muscles and felt crocodilian forms\nstaggering and going down beneath his frenzied blows. He heard the\nroar of an automatic close beside him in the melee as Milton\nremembered at last through the red haze of his fury the weapon he\ncarried, but before either Randall or Lanier could reach their own\nweapons a new wave of crocodilian forms had poured onto them that by\nsheer pressing weight held them helpless, to be disarmed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHissing orders sounded, the arms and legs of the three were tightly\ngrasped by great taloned paws, and the masses of Martians about them\nmelted back from the dais. Held each by two great creatures, Milton\nand Randall and Lanier faced again the triple-bodied Martian Master,\nwho in all that wild moment of struggle appeared not to have changed\nhis position. The big monster's black eyes stared unmovedly down at\nthem.\n\n\"You Earth-beings seem of lower intelligence even than we thought,\"\nhis hissing voice informed them. \"And those weapons--crude, very\ncrude.\"\n\nMilton, his face set, spoke back: \"It may be that you will find human\nweapons of some power if your hordes reach earth,\" he said.\n\n\"But what compared with the power of ours?\" the other asked coldly.\n\"And since our scientists even now devise new weapons to annihilate\nthe earth's races, I think they would be glad of three of those races\nto experiment with now. The one use we can make of you, certainly.\"\n\nThe creature turned its bulging head a little towards the guards who\nheld the three men, and uttered a brief hissing order. Instantly the\nsix Martians, grasping the three tightly, marched them across the\ngreat hall and through a different door than that by which they had\nentered.\n\nThey were taken down a narrow corridor that turned sharply twice as\nthey went on. Randall saw that it was lit by squares inset in the\nwalls that glowed with crimson light. It came to him as they marched\non that night must be upon the Martian city without, since the sun had\nbeen sinking when they had crossed it in the centipede-machine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough what seemed an ante-room they were taken, and then into a long\nhall instantly recognizable as a laboratory. There were many glowing\nsquares illuminating it, and narrow windows high in the wall gave them\na glimpse of the city outside, a pattern of crimson lights. Long metal\ntables and racks filled the big room's farther end, while along the\nwalls were ranged shining mechanisms of unfamiliar and grotesque\nappearance. Fully a score of the crocodilian Martians were busy in the\nroom, some intent on their work at the racks and tables, others\noperating some of the strange machines.\n\nThe guards conducted the three to an open space by the wall, below one\nof the high window-openings and between two great cylindrical\nmechanisms. Then, while five of their number held the three men\nprisoned in that space by the threat of their levelled ray-tubes, the\nother moved toward one of the busy Martian scientists and held with\nhim a brief interchange of hissing speech.\n\nMilton leaned to whisper to the other two: \"We've got to get out of\nthis while we're still living,\" he whispered. \"You heard the Martian\nMaster--in constructing that matter-receiver on earth, we've opened a\ndoor through which all the Martian millions will pour onto our world!\"\n\n\"It's useless, Milton,\" said Randall dully. \"Even if we got clear of\nthis the Martians will be at their matter-transmitter in hordes when\nthe moment comes to flash back to earth.\"\n\n\"I know that, but we've got to try,\" the other insisted. \"If we or\nsome of us could get clear of this, we might in some way hide near the\nmatter-transmitter until the moment came and then fight to it.\"\n\n\"But how to get out of the hands of these, even?\" asked Lanier,\nnodding toward the alert guards before them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There's but one way,\" Milton whispered swiftly. \"Our earthly muscles\nwould enable us, I think, to get through this window-opening above us\nin a leap, if we had a moment's chance. Well, whichever of us they\ntake to experiment with or examine first, must make a struggle or\ndisturbance that will turn the guards' attention for a moment and give\nthe other two a chance to make the attempt!\"\n\n\"One to stay and the other two to get away....\" Randall said slowly;\nbut Milton's tense whisper interrupted:\n\n\"It's the only way, and even then a thousand to one chance! But it's\nwe who have opened this gate for the Martian invasion of our world and\nit's we who must--\"\n\nBefore he could finish, the approach of hissing voices told them that\nthe leader of the six guards and the Martian who seemed the chief of\nthe experimenters in the hall were nearing them. The three men stood\nsilent and tense as the two crocodilian monsters stopped before them.\nThe scientist, who carried in his metal-belt, instead of a ray-tube a\ncompact case of instruments, surveyed them as though in curiosity.\n\nHe came closer, his quick reptilian eyes taking in with evident\ninterest every feature of their bodily appearance. Intuitively the\nthree knew that one of them was to be chosen for a first investigation\nby the Martian scientists, and that that one would have not even the\nslender hope of escape open to the other two. A strange lottery of\nlife and death!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRandall saw the creature's gaze turn from one to another of them, and\nthen heard the hiss of his voice as he pointed a taloned paw toward\nMilton. Instantly two of the guards had seized Milton and had jerked\nhim out from the wall, the other guards holding back Randall and\nLanier with threatening tubes. It was upon Milton that the fatal\nchoice had fallen!\n\nRandall and Lanier made together a half-movement forward, but Milton,\na tense message in his eyes, forced them back. The guards who held the\nphysicist led him, at the direction of the Martian scientist, toward a\ngreat upright frame at the room's far end, upon which were clustered a\nscore of dial-indicators. From these flexible cords led; and now the\nscientists began attaching these by clips to various spots on Milton's\nbody. Some mechanical examination of his bodily characteristics were\napparently to be made. Milton shot suddenly a glance at the two by the\nwall, and his head nodded in an almost imperceptible signal. The\nmuscles of Lanier and Randall tensed.\n\nThen abruptly Milton seemed to go mad. He shouted aloud in a terrible\nvoice, and at the same moment tore from him the cords just attached,\nhis fists striking out then at the amazed Martians around him. As they\nleaped back from that sudden explosion of activity and sound on\nMilton's part the guards before Randall and Lanier whirled\ninstinctively for an instant toward it. And in that instant the two\nhad leaped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was upward they leaped, with all the force of their earthly\nmuscles, toward the big window-opening a half-dozen feet in the wall\nabove them. Like released steel springs they sat up, and Randall heard\nthe thump of their feet as they struck the opening's sill, heard wild\ncries suddenly coming from beneath them, as the guards turned back\ntoward them. Crimson rays clove up like light toward them, but the\ninstant's surprise had been enough, and in it they had leaped on and\nthrough the opening, into the outside night!\n\nAs they shot downward and struck the metal paving outside, Randall\nheard a wild babble of cries from inside. A moment he and Lanier gazed\nfrenziedly around them, then were running with great leaps along the\nbase of the building from which they had just escaped.\n\nIn the darkness of night the Martian city stretched away to their\nright, its massive dark cone-structures outlined by points of glowing\nruddy light here and there upon them. Beside the city's metal streets\nwere illuminated by the brilliant field of stars overhead and by the\nsoft light of the two moons, one much larger than the other, that\nmoved among those stars.\n\nAlong the street crocodilian Martians were coming and going still,\nthough in small numbers, there being but few in sight in the dim-lit\nstreet's length. Lanier pointed ahead as they leaped onward.\n\n\"Straight onward, Randall!\" he jerked. \"There seem fewer of the\nMartians this way!\"\n\n\"But the great cone of the matter-station is the other way!\" Randall\nexclaimed.\n\n\"We can't risk making for it now!\" cried the other. \"We've got to keep\nclear of them until the alarm is over. Hear them now?\"\n\nFor even as they leaped forward a rising clamor of hissing cries and\nrush of feet was coming from behind as scores of Martians poured out\ninto the darkness from the great cone-building. The two fugitives had\npassed by then from the shadow of the mighty structure, and as they\nran along the broad metal street toward the shadow of the next cone,\nthrough the light of the moons above, they heard higher cries and then\nglimpsed narrow shafts of crimson force cleaving the night around\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRandall, as the deadly rays drove past him, heard the low detonating\nsound made by their destruction of the air in their path, and the\ninrush of new air. But in the misty and uncertain moonlight the rays\ncould not be loosed accurately, and before they could be swept\nsidewise to annihilate the two fleeing men they had gained, with a\nlast great leap, the shadow of the next building.\n\nOn they ran, the clatter of the Martian pursuit growing more noisy\nbehind them. Randall heard Lanier gasping with each great leap, and\nfelt himself at every breath a knife of pain stabbing through his\nlungs, the rarified atmosphere of the red planet taking its toll.\nAgain from the darkness behind them the crimson rays clove, but this\ntime were wide of their mark.\n\nWith every moment the clamor of pursuit seemed growing louder, the\nalarm spreading out over the Martian city and arousing it. As they\nraced past cone after cone, Randall knew even the increased power of\ntheir muscles could not long aid them against the exhaustion which the\nthin air was imposing on them. His thoughts spun for a moment to\nMilton, in the laboratory behind, and then back to their own desperate\nplight.\n\nAbruptly shapes loomed in the misty light before them! A group of\nthree great Martians, reptilian shapes that had been coming toward\nthem and had stopped for an instant in amazement at sight of the\nrunning pair. There was no time to halt themselves, to evade the\nthree, and with a mutual instinct Lanier and Randall seized together\nthe last expedient open to them. They ran straight forward toward the\nastounded three, and when a half-score feet from them, leaped with all\ntheir force upward and toward them, their tensed bodies flying through\nthe air with feet outstretched before them.\n\nThen they had struck the group of three with feet-foremost, and with\nthe impetus of that great leap had knocked them sprawling to this side\nand that, while with a supreme effort the two kept their balance and\nleaped on. The cries of the three added to the din behind them as they\nthrew themselves forward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey flung themselves past a last cone building to halt for an instant\nin utter amazement despite the nearing pursuit. Before them were no\nmore streets and structures, but a huge smooth-flowing waterway! It\ngleamed in the moonlight and lay at right angles across their path,\nseeming to flow along the Martian city's edge.\n\n\"A canal!\" cried Lanier. \"It's one of the canals that meet at this\ncity and flow around it! We're trapped--we've reached the city's\nedge!\"\n\n\"Not yet!\" Randall gasped. \"Look!\"\n\nAs he pointed to the left Lanier shot a glance there; and then both of\nthem were running in that direction, along the smooth metal paving\nthat bordered the mighty canal. They came to what Randall had seen, a\nmighty metal arch that soared out over the waterway to its opposite\nside. A bridge!\n\nThey were on it, were racing up the smooth incline of it. Randall\nglanced back as they reached the arch's summit. From that height the\ncity stretched far away behind them, a lace of crimson lights in the\nnight. He glimpsed the gleam of the giant waterway that encircled the\ncity completely, one that was fed by other canals from far away that\nemptied into it, the great city's vital water-supply brought thus from\nthis world's melting polar snows.\n\nThere were moving lights behind now, too, pouring out onto the metal\npaving by the waterway, moving to and fro as though in confusion, with\na babel of hissing cries. It was not until Randall and Lanier were\nrunning down the descending incline of the great arched bridge,\nthough, that the lights and shouts of their pursuers began to move up\non that bridge after them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRunning off the bridge's smooth way, the two found themselves\nstumbling on through the darkness over more metal paving, and then\nover soft ground. There were no lights or buildings or sounds of any\nsort on this farther side of the great waterway. A tall dark wall\nseemed suddenly to loom up out of the darkness some distance ahead of\nthe two.\n\n\"The crimson jungle!\" Randall cried. \"The jungles we glimpsed from the\ncity! It's a chance to hide!\"\n\nThey raced toward the protecting blackness of that wall of vegetation.\nThey reached it, flung themselves inside, just as the pursuing\nMartians, a mass of running crocodilian shapes and of great racing\ncentipede-machines, swept up over the bridge's arch behind. A moment\nthe two halted in the thick vegetation's shelter, gasping for breath,\nthen were moving forward through the jungle's denser darkness.\n\nThick about them and far above them towered the masses of strange\ntrees and plant life through which they made their way. Randall could\nsee but dimly the nature of these plant-forms, but could make out that\nthey were grotesque and unearthly in appearance, all leafless, and\nwith masses of thin tendrils branching from them instead of leaves. He\nrealized that it was only beside the arid planet's great canals that\nthis profusion of plant life had sufficient moisture for existence,\nand that it was the broad bands of jungle bordering the canals that\nhad made the latter visible to earth's astronomers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLanier and he halted for a moment to listen. The thick jungle about\nthem seemed quite silent. But from behind there came through it a\nvague tumult of hissing calls; and then, as they glimpsed red flashes\nfar behind, they heard the crashing of great masses of the leafless\ntrees.\n\n\"The rays!\" whispered Lanier. \"They're beating through the jungle with\nthem and the centipede-machines after us!\"\n\nThey paused no more, but pushed on through the thick growths with\nrenewed urgency. Now and then, as they passed through small clearings,\nRandall glimpsed overhead the fast-moving nearer moon and slower\nsailing farther moon of Mars, moving across the steady stars. In some\nof these clearings they saw, too, strange great openings burrowed in\nthe ground as though by some strange animal.\n\nThe crashing clamor of the Martians beating the jungle behind was\ncoming close, ever closer, and as they came to still another misty-lit\nclearing, Lanier paused, with face white and tense.\n\n\"They're closing in on us!\" he said. \"They're hunting us down by\nbeating the jungle with those centipede-machines, and even if we\nescape them we're getting farther from the city and the matter-station\neach moment!\"\n\nRandall's eyes roved desperately around the clearing; and then, as\nthey fell on a group of the great burrowed openings that seemed\npresent everywhere about them, he uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"These holes! We can hide in one until they've passed over us, and\nthen steal back to the city!\"\n\nLanier's eyes lit. \"It's a chance!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey sprang toward the openings. They were each of some four feet\ndiameter, extending indefinitely downward as though the mouths of\ntunnels. In a moment Randall was lowering himself into one, Lanier\nafter him. The tunnel in which they were, they found, curved to one\nside a few feet below the surface. They crawled down this curve until\nthey were out of sight of the opening above. They crouched silent,\nthen, listening.\n\nThere came down to them the dull, distant clamor of the\ncentipede-machines crashing through the jungle, cutting a way with\nrays, their clamor growing ever louder. Then Randall, who was lowest\nin the tunnel, turned suddenly as there came to him a strange rustling\nsound from _beneath_ him. It was as though some crawling or creeping\nthing was moving in the tunnel below them!\n\nHe grasped the arm of Lanier, beside and a little above him, to warn\nhim, but the words he was about to whisper never were uttered. For at\nthis moment a big shapeless living thing seemed to flash up toward\nthem through the darkness from beneath, cold ropelike tentacles\ngripped both tightly; and then in an instant they were being dragged\nirresistibly down into the lightless tunnel's depths!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they were pulled swiftly downward into the tunnel by the tentacles\nthat grasped them an involuntary cry of horror came from Randall and\nLanier alike. They twisted frantically in the cold grip that held\nthem, but found it of the quality of steel. And as Randall twisted in\nit to strike frantically down through the darkness at whatever thing\nof horror held them, his clenched fist met but the cold smooth skin\nof some big, soft-bodied creature!\n\nDown--down--remorselessly they were being drawn farther into the black\ndepths of the tunnel by the great thing crawling down below them.\nAgain and again the two twisted and struck, but could not shake its\nhold. In sheer exhaustion they ceased to struggle, dragged helplessly\nfarther down.\n\nWas it minutes or hours, Randall wondered afterward, of that horrible\nprogress downward, that passed before they glimpsed light beneath? A\nfeeble glow, hardly discernible, it was, and as they went lower still\nhe saw that it was caused by the tunnel passing through a strata of\nradio-active rock that gave off the faint light. In that light they\nglimpsed for the first time the horror dragging them downward.\n\nIt was a huge worm creature! A thing like a giant angleworm, three\nfeet or more in thickness and thrice that in length, its great body\nsoft and cold and worm-like. From the end nearest them projected two\nlong tentacles with which it had gripped the two men and was dragging\nthem down the tunnel after it! Randall glimpsed a mouth-aperture in\nthe tentacled end of the worm body also, and two scarlike marks above\nit, placed like eyes, although eyes the monstrous thing had not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut a moment they glimpsed it and then were in darkness again as the\ntunnel passed through the radio-active strata and lower. The horror of\nthat moment's glimpse, though, made them strike out in blind\nrepulsion, but relentlessly the creature dragged them after it.\n\n\"God!\" It was Lanier's panting cry as they were dragged on. \"This worm\nmonster--we're hundreds of feet below the surface!\"\n\nRandall sought to reply, but his voice choked. The air about them was\nclose and damp, with an overpowering earthy smell. He felt\nconsciousness leaving him.\n\nA gleam of soft light--they were passing more radio-active patches. He\nfelt the wild convulsive struggles of Lanier against the thing; and\nthen suddenly the tunnel ended, debouched into a far-stretching,\nlow-ceilinged cavity. It was feebly illuminated by radio-active\npatches here and there in walls and ceiling, and as the monster that\nheld them halted on entering the cavity, Randall and Lanier lay in its\ngrip and stared across the weird place with intensified horror.\n\nFor it was swarming with countless worm monsters! All were like the\none who held them, thick long worm bodies with projecting tentacles\nand with black eyeless faces. They were crawling to and fro in this\ncavern far beneath the surface, swarming in hordes around and over\neach other, pouring in and out of the awful place from countless\ntunnels that led upward and downward from it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA world of worm monsters, beneath the surface of the Martian jungles!\nAs Randall stared across that swarming, dim-lit cave of horror,\nphysically sick at sight of it, he remembered the countless tunnel\nopenings they had glimpsed in their flight through the jungle, and\nremembered the remark of the Martian who had first guided them across\nthe city, that in the jungles were living things, of a sort. These\nwere the things, worm monsters whose unthinkable networks of tunnels\nand burrows formed beneath the surface a veritable worm world!\n\n\"Randall!\" It was Lanier's thick exclamation. \"Randall--those\nscar-marks on their--faces--you see--?\"\n\n\"See?\"\n\n\"Those marks! These creatures had eyes once but must have been forced\ndown here by the Martians. These may once have been--ages ago--human!\"\n\nAt that thought Randall felt horror overcoming his senses. He was\naware that the great worm monster holding them was dragging them\nforward through the cavern, that others of the swarms there were\ncrowding around them, feeling them blindly with their tentacles,\nhelping to drag them forward.\n\nHalf-carried and half-dragged they went, scores of tentacles now\nholding them, great worm shapes crawling forward on all sides of them\nand accompanying them along the cavern's length. He glimpsed worm\nmonsters here and there emerging from the upward tunnels with masses\nof strange plant stuff in their grasp that others blindly devoured.\nHis senses reeled from the suffocating air, the great cavity being but\na half-score feet in height, burrowed from the damp earth by these\nnumberless things.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe faint, strange light of the radio-active patches showed him that\nthey were approaching the cavern's end. Tunnels opened from its end as\nfrom all its walls and floor, and into one Randall was dragged by the\ncreatures, one before and one behind, grasping him, and Lanier being\nbrought behind him in the same way. In the close tunnel the heavy air\nwas deadly, and he was but partly conscious when again, after moments\nof crawling along it, he felt himself dragged out into another cavern.\n\nThis earth-walled cavity, though, seemed to extend farther than the\nfirst, though of the same height as the first and with a few\nradio-active illuminating patches. In it seethed and swarmed literally\nhundreds on hundreds of the worm monsters, a sea of great crawling\nbodies. Randall and Lanier saw that they were being carried and\ndragged now toward the farther end of this larger cavity.\n\nAs they approached it, pushing through the swarming creatures who felt\nthem with inquisitive tentacles as their captors took them forward,\nthe two men saw that a great shape was looming up in the faint light\nat the cave's far end. In moments they were close enough to discern\nits nature, and a horror and awe filled them at sight of it more\nintense than they had yet felt.\n\nFor the looming shape was a huge earthen image or statue of a worm! It\nwas shaped with a childish crudeness from the solid earth, a giant\nearthen worm shape whose body looped across the cave's end, and whose\ntentacled head or front end was reared upward to the cavity's roof.\nBefore this awful earthen shape was a section of the cave's floor\nhigher than the rest, and on it a great crudely shaped rectangular\nearthen block.\n\n\"Lanier--that shape!\" whispered Randall in his horror. \"That earthen\nimage, made by these creatures--it's the worm god they've made for\nthemselves!\"\n\n\"A worm god!\" Lanier repeated, staring toward it as they were dragged\nnearer. \"Then that block....\"\n\n\"Its altar!\" Randall exclaimed. \"These things have some dim spark of\nintelligence or memory! They're brought us here to--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore he could finish, the clutching tentacles of the worm monsters\nabout them had dragged them up onto the raised floor beside the block,\nbeneath the looming earthen worm shape. There they glimpsed for the\nfirst time in the faint light another who stood there held tightly by\nthe tentacles of two worm monsters. It was a Martian!\n\nThe big crocodilian shape was apparently a prisoner like themselves,\ncaptured and brought down from above. His reptilian eyes surveyed\nLanier and Randall quickly as they were dragged up and held beside\nhim, but he took no other interest. To the two men, at the moment, it\nseemed that his great crocodilian shape was human, almost, so much\nmore man-like was it than the grotesque worm monsters before them.\n\nWith a half-dozen of the creatures holding the two men and the Martian\ntightly, another great worm monster crawled to the edge of the raised\nearth floor in front of the giant worm god's image, and then reared up\nthe first third of his thick body into the air. By then the great,\nfaint-lit cavity stretching before them was filled with countless\nnumbers of the monsters, pouring into it from all the tunnels that\nopened into it from above and below, packing it thick with their\ngrotesque bodies as far as the eye could reach in the dim light.\n\nThey were seething and crawling in that great mass; but as the worm\nmonster on the elevation upreared, all in the cavity seemed suddenly\nto quiet. Then the upreared eyeless thing began to move his long\ntentacles. Very slowly at first he waved them back and forth, and\nslowly the masses of monsters in the cavity, all turned by some sense\ntoward him, did likewise, the cavity becoming a forest of upraised\ntentacles waving rhythmically back and forth in unison with those of\nthe leader.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack and forth--back and forth--Randall felt caught in some torturing\nnightmare as he watched the countless tentacle-feelers waving thus\nfrom one side to the other. It was a ceremony, he knew--some strange\nrite springing perhaps from dim memory alone, that these worm monsters\ncarried out thus before the looming shape of their worm god. Only the\nsix that held the three captives never relaxed their grip.\n\nStill on and on went the strange and senseless rite. By then the\nclose, damp air of that cavity far beneath Mars' surface was sinking\nRandall and Lanier deeper into a half-consciousness. The Martian\nbeside them never moved or spoke. The upstretched tentacles of the\nleader and of the great worm horde before him never ceased swaying\nrhythmically from side to side.\n\nRandall, half-hypnotized by those swaying tentacles and but\nsemi-conscious by then, could only estimate afterward how long that\ngrotesque rite went on. Hours it must have endured, he knew, hours in\nwhich each opening of his eyes revealed only the dimly-illuminated\ncavern, the worm monsters that filled it, the forest of tentacles\nwaving in unison. It was only toward the end of those hours that he\nnoticed vaguely that the tentacles were waving faster and faster.\n\nAnd as the tentacles of leader and worm horde waved alike ever more\nswiftly an atmosphere of growing excitement and expectation seemed to\nhold the horde. At last the upstretched feelers were whipping back and\nforth almost too swiftly for the eye to follow. Then abruptly the worm\nleader ceased the motion himself, and while the horde before him\ncontinued it, turned and crawled to the three captives.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn an instant, as though in answer to a second command, the two worm\nmonsters who held the Martian dragged him forward toward the great\nearthen block before the worm god's image. Two others of the creatures\ncame from the side, and the four swiftly stretched the Martian flat on\nthe block's top, each of the four grasping with their tentacles one of\nhis four taloned limbs. They seemed to hesitate then, the worm leader\nbeside them, the tentacles of the horde waving swiftly still.\n\nAbruptly the tentacles of the leader flashed up as though in a signal.\nThere was a dull ripping sound, and in that moment Randall and Lanier\nsaw the Martian on the block torn literally limb from limb by the four\ngreat worm monsters who had held his four limbs!\n\nThe tentacles of the horde waved suddenly with increased, excited\nswiftness at that. Randall shrank in horror.\n\n\"They've brought us here for that!\" he cried. \"To sacrifice us on that\naltar that way to their worm god!\"\n\nBut Lanier too had cried out, appalled, as he saw that awful\nsacrifice, and both strained madly against the grip of the worm\ncreatures. Their struggles were in vain, and then in answer to another\nunspoken command the two monsters that held Randall were dragging him\nalso to the earthen altar!\n\nHe felt himself gripped by the four great creatures around the block,\nfelt as he struggled with his last strength that he was being\nstretched out on the block, each of the four at one of its corners\ngrasping one of his limbs. He heard Lanier's mad cries as though from\na great distance, glimpsed as he was held thus on his back the great\nshape of the earthen worm god reared over him, and then glimpsed the\nleader of the monsters rearing beside him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dull sound of the swift-waving tentacles of the horde came to him,\nthere was a tense moment of agony of waiting, and then the tentacles\nof the leader flashed up in the signal!\n\nBut at the same moment Randall felt his limbs released by the four\nmonsters that had held them! There seemed sudden wild confusion in the\ngreat cave. The strange rite broke off; the horde of worm monsters\ncrawled frantically this way and that in it. Randall slipped off the\nblock; staggered to his feet.\n\nThe worm monsters in the cave were swarming toward the downward tunnel\nopenings! The two captives forgotten, the creatures were pouring in\ncrawling, fighting swarms toward those openings. And then, as Randall\nand Lanier stared stupefied, there came a red flash from one of the\nupward tunnels and a brilliant crimson ray stabbed down and mowed a\npath of annihilation in the cave's earthen side!\n\nThe two heard great thumping sounds from above, saw the tunnels\nleading from above becoming suddenly many times greater in size as red\nrays flashed down along them to gouge the tunnel's walls. Then down\nfrom those enlarged tunnels there were bursting long shining shapes,\ngreat centipede-machines crawling down the tunnels which their rays\nmade larger before them! And as the centipede-machines burst down into\nthe cavern their crimson rays stabbed right and left to cut paths of\nannihilation among the worms.\n\n\"The Martians!\" Lanier cried. \"They didn't find us above--they knew we\nmust have been taken by these things--and they've come down after us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Back, Lanier!\" Randall shouted. \"Quick, before they see us, behind\nthis--\"\n\nAs he spoke he was jerking Lanier with him behind the looming earthen\nstatue of the great worm god. Crouched there between the statue and\nthe cave's wall they were hidden precariously from the view of those\nin the cavern. And now that cavern had become a scene of horror\nunthinkable as the centipede-machines pouring down into it blasted the\nfrantically crawling worm monsters with their rays.\n\nThe worm monsters attempted no resistance, but sought only to escape\ninto their downward tunnels, and in moments those not caught by the\nrays had vanished in the openings. But the centipede-machines, after\nracing swiftly around the cavity, were following them, were going down\ninto those downward tunnels also, their rays blasting down ahead of\neach to make the tunnel large enough for them to follow.\n\nIn a moment all but one had vanished down into the openings, the\nremaining one having its front or head jammed in one of the openings\nfrom the failure of its operator to blast a large enough opening\nbefore him. As Lanier and Randall watched tensely they saw the\nmachine's control room door open and a Martian descend. He inspected\nthe tunnel opening in which his vehicle was jammed, then with a hand\nray-tube began to disintegrate the earth around that opening to free\nhis machine.\n\nRandall clutched his companion's arm. \"That machine!\" he whispered.\n\"If we could capture it, it would give us a chance to get back to the\ncity--to Milton and the matter-transmitter!\"\n\nLanier started, then nodded swiftly. \"We'll chance it,\" he whispered.\n\"For our twenty-four hours here must be almost up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey hesitated a moment, then crept forward from behind the great\nearthen statue. The Martian had his back to them, his attention on the\nfreeing of his mechanism. Across the dim-lit cavern they crept softly,\nand were within a dozen feet of the Martian when some sound made him\nwheel quickly to confront them with the deadly tube. But even as he\nwhirled the two had leaped.\n\nThe force of their leap sent them flying through that dozen feet of\nspace to strike the Martian at the moment his tube levelled. One\nhissing call he uttered as they struck him, and then with all his\nstrength Lanier had grasped the crocodilian body and bent it backward.\nSomething in it snapped, and the Martian collapsed limply. The two\nlooked wildly around.\n\nNothing showed that the Martian's call had been heard, and after a\nmoment's glance that showed the head of the centipede machine already\nfreed, they were clambering up into its control room, closing the\ndoor. Randall seized the knob with which he had seen the machines\noperated. As he pulled it toward him the machine moved across the\ntunnel opening and raced smoothly over the cavern's floor. As he\nturned the knob the machine turned swiftly in the same direction.\n\nHe headed the long mechanism toward one of the upward-curving tunnels\nwhich the Martians had blasted larger in descending. They were almost\nto it when there flashed up into the cavity from one of the downward\ntunnel openings a centipede-machine, and then another, and another.\nThe Martians in their transparent-windowed control rooms took in at a\nglance the dead crocodilian on the floor, and then the three great\nmachines were darting toward that of Randall and Lanier.\n\n\"The Martian we killed!\" Randall cried. \"They heard his call and are\ncoming after us!\"\n\n\"Turn to the wall!\" Lanier shouted to him. \"I have the rays--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment there was a clicking beside Randall and he glimpsed\nLanier pulling forth two small grips he had found, then saw that two\ncrimson rays were stabbing from tubes in their machine's front toward\nthe others even as their own rays darted back. The beams that had been\nloosed toward them grazed past them as Randall whirled their machine\nto the wall, and he saw one of the three attacking mechanisms vanish\nas Lanier's beams struck it.\n\nAround--back--with instinctive, lightninglike motions he whirled their\ncentipede-machine in the great dim-lit cave as the two remaining ones\nleapt again to the attack. Their rays shot right and left to catch the\ntwo men's vehicle in a trap of death, and as Randall swung their own\nmechanism straight ahead he glimpsed at the cavern's far end the great\nearthen worm god still upreared.\n\nOn either side of them the red beams burned as they leapt forward, but\nas though running a gauntlet of death Randall kept the machine racing\nforward in the succeeding second until the two others loomed on either\nside of it. Then Lanier's beams were driving in turn to right and left\nof them and the two vanished as though by magic as they were struck.\n\n\"Up to the surface!\" Lanier cried, his eyes on the glowing dial of his\nwrist-watch. \"We've been held hours here--we've but a half-hour or\nmore before earth midnight!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRandall sent their machine racing again toward one of the upward\ntunnels, and as the long mechanism began to climb smoothly up the\ndarkness he heard Lanier agonizing beside him.\n\n\"God, if we have only enough time to get to that matter-transmitter\nbefore the Martians start flashing to earth through it!\"\n\n\"But Milton?\" Randall cried. \"We don't know whether he's alive or\ndead! We can't leave him!\"\n\n\"We must!\" said Lanier solemnly. \"Our duty's to the earth now, man, to\nthe world that we alone can save from the Martian invasion and\nconquest! At the hour of twelve Nelson will have the matter-receiver\nturned on and at that hour the Martian will start flashing to\nearth--unless we prevent!\"\n\nSuddenly Randall grasped the knob in his hands more tightly as light\nshowed above them. They had been climbing upward through the enlarged\ntunnel at their machine's highest speed, and now as the tunnel curved\nthe light grew stronger. Suddenly they were emerging into the thin\nsunlight of the Martian day.\n\nIn the crimson jungle about them were many Martians, milling excitedly\nto and fro, and other centipede-machines that were blasting their way\ndown through tunnels to the worm world beneath.\n\nRandall and Lanier, breathless, crouched low in the\ntransparent-windowed control room as they sent their mechanism racing\nthrough this scene of swarming activity. Both gasped as one of the\ncentipede-machines clashed against their own in passing, its Martian\ndriver turning to stare after them. But there came no alarm, and in a\nmoment they had passed out of the swarm of Martians and machines and\nwere heading through the jungle in the direction of the city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough the weird red vegetation their mechanism raced with them,\nRandall holding it at its highest speed, and in minutes they came out\nof the jungle and were racing over the clear space between it and the\ngreat canal. Beyond that canal loomed into the thin sunlight the\nclustering cones of the mighty Martian city, two towering above all\nthe others--the cone of the Martian Master and the other cone in which\nwas the matter-transmitter and receiver.\n\nIt was toward the latter that Lanier pointed. \"Head straight toward\nthat cone, Randall--we've but minutes left!\"\n\nThey were racing now up over the great arch of the canal's metal\nbridge, and then scuttling smoothly off it and along the broad metal\nstreet through which they had fled in darkness hours before. In it\nMartians and centipede-machines were coming and going in great\nnumbers, but none noticed the human forms of the two crouched low in\ntheir mechanism's control room.\n\nThey were rushing then toward the looming cone of the Martian Master.\nAs they flashed past it Randall saw Lanier's face working, knew the\ndesire that tore at him even as at himself to burst inside and\nascertain whether or not Milton still lived in the laboratories from\nwhich they had fled. But they were past it, faces white and grim, were\nrushing on through the Martian city at reckless speed toward the other\nmighty cone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed that all in the great city were heading toward the same\ngoal, streams of crocodilian Martians and masses of shining\ncentipede-machines filling the streets as they moved toward it. As\nthey came closer to the mighty structure, hearts pounding, they saw\nthat around it surged a mighty mass of Martians and machines. The\nhordes waiting to be released through the matter-transmitter inside\nupon the unsuspecting earth!\n\n\"Try to get the machine inside!\" Lanier whispered tensely. \"If we can\nsmash that transmitter yet....\"\n\nRandall nodded grimly. \"Keep ready at the ray-tubes,\" he told the\nother.\n\nAs unobtrusively as possible he sent their long mechanism worming\nforward through the vast throng of machines and Martians, toward the\ngreat cone's door. Crouching low, the hands of their watches closing\nfast toward the twelfth figure, they edged forward in the long\nmachine. At last they were moving through the mighty door, into the\ncone's interior.\n\nThey moved slowly on through the mass of machines and crocodile forms\ninside, then halted. For at the great crowd's center was a clear\ncircle hundreds of feet across, and as Randall gazed across it his\nheart seemed to leap once and then stop.\n\nAt the center of that clear circle rose the two cubical metal chambers\nof the matter-transmitter and receiver. The transmitting chamber, they\nsaw, was flooded with humming force, with white light pouring from its\ninner walls. It was already in operation, and the masses of Martians\nin the great cone were only waiting for the moment to sound when the\nreceiver on earth would be operating also. Then they would pour into\nthe chamber to be flashed in masses across the gulf to earth! The eyes\nof all in the cone seemed turned toward an erect dial-mechanism beside\nthe chambers which was clocklike in appearance, and that would mark\nthe moment when the first Martian could enter the transmitting-chamber\nand flash out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little distance from the two metal chambers stood a low dais on\nwhich there sat the hideous triple-bodied form of the Martian Master.\nAround him were the massed members of his council, waiting like him\nfor the start of their age-planned invasion of earth. And beside the\ndais was a figure between two crocodilian guards at sight of whom\nRandall forgot all else.\n\n\"Milton! My God, Lanier, it's Milton!\"\n\n\"Milton! They've brought him here to torture or kill him if they find\nhe's lied about the moment they could flash to earth!\"\n\nMilton! And at sight of him something snapped in Randall's brain.\n\nWith a single motion of the knob he sent their centipede-machine\ncrashing out into the clear circle at the mighty cone's center. A wild\nuproar of hissing cries broke from all the thousands in it as he sent\nthe mechanism whirling toward the dais of the Martian Master. He saw\nthe crocodilian forms there scattering blindly before him, and then\nas his rays drove out and spun and stabbed in mad figures of crimson\ndeath through the astounded Martian masses he saw Milton looking up\ntoward them, crying out crazily to them as his two guards loosed him\nfor the moment.\n\nA high call from the Martian Master ripped across the hall and was\nanswered by a shattering roar of hissing voices as Martians and\nmachines surged madly toward them. Randall and Lanier in a single leap\nwere out of the centipede-machine, and in an instant had half-dragged\nMilton with them in a great leap up to the edge of the humming\ntransmitting chamber.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMilton was shouting hoarsely to them over the wild uproar. To enter\nthat transmitting chamber before the destined moment was annihilation,\nto be flashed out with no receiver on earth awaiting them. They\nturned, struck with all their strength at the first Martians rushing\nup to them. No rays flashed, for a ray loosed would destroy the\nchamber behind them that was the one gate for the Martians to the\nworld they would invade. But as the Martian Master's high call hissed\nagain all the countless crocodilian forms in the great cone were\nrushing toward them.\n\nBraced at the very edge of the humming, light-filled chamber, Randall\nand Lanier and Milton struck madly at the Martians surging up toward\nthem. Randall seemed in a dream. A score of taloned paws clutched him\nfrom beneath; scaled forms collapsed under his insane blows.\n\nThe whole vast cone and surging reptilian hordes seemed spinning at\nincreasing speed around him. As his clenched fists flashed with waning\nstrength he glimpsed crocodilian forms swarming up on either side of\nthem, glimpsed Lanier down, talons reaching toward him, Milton\nfighting over him like a madman. Another moment would see it\nended--reptilian arms reaching in scores to drag him down--Milton\njerking Lanier half to his feet. The Martian Master's call\nsounded--and then came a great clanging sound at which the Martian\nhordes seemed to freeze for an instant motionless, at which Milton's\nvoice reached him in a supreme cry.\n\n_\"Randall--the transmitter!\"_\n\nFor in that instant Milton was leaping back with Lanier, and as\nRandall with his last strength threw himself backward with them into\nthe humming transmitting-chamber's brilliant light, he heard a last\nfrenzied roar of hissing cries from the Martian hordes about them.\nThen as the brilliant light and force from the chamber's walls smote\nthem, Randall felt himself hurled into blackness inconceivable, that\nsmashed like a descending curtain across his brain.\n\nThe curtain of blackness lifted for a moment. He was lying with Milton\nand Lanier in another chamber whose force beat upon them. He saw a\nyellow-lit room instead of the great cone--saw the tense, anxious face\nof Nelson at the switch beside them. He strove to move, made to Nelson\na gesture with his arm that seemed to drain all strength and life from\nhim; and then, as in answer to it Nelson drove up the switch and\nturned off the force of the matter-receiver in which they lay, the\nblack curtain descended on Randall's brain once more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later it was when Milton and Randall and Lanier and Nelson\nturned to the laboratory's door. They paused to glance behind them. Of\nthe great matter-transmitter and receiver, of the apparatus that had\ncrowded the laboratory, there remained now but wreckage.\n\nFor that had been their first thought, their first task, when the\nastounded Nelson had brought the three back to consciousness and had\nheard their amazing tale. They had wrecked so completely the\nmatter-station and its actuating apparatus that none could ever have\nguessed what a mechanism of wonder the laboratory a short time before\nhad held.\n\nThe cubical chambers had been smashed beyond all recognition, the\ndynamos were masses of split metal and fused wiring, the batteries of\ntubes were shattered, the condensers and transformers and wiring\ndemolished. And it had only been when the last written plans and\nblue-prints of the mechanism had been burned that Milton and Randall\nand Lanier had stopped to allow their exhausted bodies a moment of\nrest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow as they paused at the laboratory's door, Lanier reached and swung\nit open. Together, silent, they gazed out.\n\nIt all seemed to Randall exactly as upon the night before. The shadowy\nmasses in the darkness, the heaving, dim-lit sea stretching far away\nbefore them, the curtain of summer stars stretched across the heavens.\nAnd, sinking westward amid those stars, the red spark of Mars toward\nwhich as though toward a magnet all their eyes had turned.\n\nMilton was speaking. \"Up there it has shone for centuries--ages--a\ncrimson spot of light. And up there the Martians have been watching,\nwatching--until at last we opened to them the gate.\"\n\nRandall's hand was on his shoulder. \"But we closed that gate, too, in\nthe end.\"\n\nMilton nodded slowly. \"We--or the fate that rules our worlds. But the\ngate is closed, and God grant, shall never again be opened by any on\nthis world.\"\n\n\"God grant it,\" the other echoed.\n\nAnd they were all gazing still toward the thing. Gazing up toward the\ncrimson spot of light that burned there among the stars, toward the\nplanet that shone red, menacing, terrible, but whose menace and whose\nterror had been thrust back even as they had crouched to spring at\nlast upon the earth.\n\n\n\n\nThe Exile of Time\n\nBEGINNING A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_Mysterious Girl_\n\n[Illustration: _Presently there was not one Robot, but three!_]\n\n[Sidenote: From somewhere out of Time come a swarm of Robots who\ninflict on New York the awful vengeance of the diabolical cripple\nTugh.]\n\n\nThe extraordinary incidents began about 1 A.M. in the night of June\n8-9, 1935. I was walking through Patton Place, in New York City, with\nmy friend Larry Gregory. My name is George Rankin. My business--and\nLarry's--are details quite unimportant to this narrative. We had been\nfriends in college. Both of us were working in New York; and with all\nour relatives in the middle west we were sharing an apartment on this\nPatton Place--a short crooked, little-known street of not particularly\nimpressive residential buildings lying near the section known as\nGreenwich Village, where towering office buildings of the business\ndistricts encroach close upon it.\n\nThis night at 1 A. M. it was deserted. A taxi stood at a corner; its\nchauffeur had left it there, and evidently gone to a nearby lunch\nroom. The street lights were, as always, inadequate. The night was\nsultry and dark, with a leaden sky and a breathless humidity that\npresaged a thunder storm. The houses were mostly unlighted at this\nhour. There was an occasional apartment house among them, but mostly\nthey were low, ramshackle affairs of brick and stone.\n\nWe were still three blocks from our apartment when without warning the\nincidents began which were to plunge us and all the city into\ndisaster. We were upon the threshold of a mystery weird and strange,\nbut we did not know it. Mysterious portals were swinging to engulf\nus. And all unknowing, we walked into them.\n\nLarry was saying, \"Wish we would get a storm to clear this air--_what\nthe devil?_ George, did you hear that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe stood listening. There had sounded a choking, muffled scream. We\nwere midway in the block. There was not a pedestrian in sight, nor any\nvehicle save the abandoned taxi at the corner.\n\n\"A woman,\" he said. \"Did it come from this house?\"\n\nWe were standing before a three-story brick residence. All its windows\nwere dark. There was a front stoop of several steps, and a basement\nentryway. The windows were all closed, and the place had the look of\nbeing unoccupied.\n\n\"Not in there, Larry,\" I answered. \"It's closed for the summer--\" But\nI got no further; we heard it again. And this time it sounded, not\nlike a scream, but like a woman's voice calling to attract our\nattention.\n\n\"George! Look there!\" Larry cried.\n\nThe glow from a street light illumined the basement entryway, and\nbehind one of the dark windows a girl's face was pressed against the\npane.\n\nLarry stood gripping me, then drew me forward and down the steps of\nthe entryway. There was a girl in the front basement room. Darkness\nwas behind her, but we could see her white frightened face close to\nthe glass. She tapped on the pane, and in the silence we heard her\nmuffled voice:\n\n\"Let me out! Oh, let me get out!\"\n\nThe basement door had a locked iron gate. I rattled it. \"No way of\ngetting in,\" I said, then stopped short with surprise. \"What the\ndevil--\"\n\nI joined Larry by the window. The girl was only a few inches from us.\nShe had a pale, frightened face; wide, terrified eyes. Even with that\nfirst glimpse, I was transfixed by her beauty. And startled; there was\nsomething weird about her. A low-necked, white satin dress disclosed\nher snowy shoulders; her head was surmounted by a pile of snow-white\nhair, with dangling white curls framing her pale ethereal beauty. She\ncalled again.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Larry demanded. \"Are you alone in there?\nWhat is it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe backed from the window; we could see her only as a white blob in\nthe darkness of the basement room.\n\nI called, \"Can you hear us? What is it?\"\n\nThen she screamed again. A low scream; but there was infinite terror\nin it. And again she was at the window.\n\n\"You will not hurt me? Let me--oh please let me come out!\" Her fists\npounded the casement.\n\nWhat I would have done I don't know. I recall wondering if the\npoliceman would be at our corner down the block; he very seldom was\nthere. I heard Larry saying:\n\n\"What the hell!--I'll get her out. George, get me that brick.... Now,\nget back, girl--I'm going to smash the window.\"\n\nBut the girl kept her face pressed against the pane. I had never seen\nsuch terrified eyes. Terrified at something behind her in the house;\nand equally frightened at us.\n\nI call to her: \"Come to the door. Can't you come to the door and open\nit?\" I pointed to the basement gate. \"Open it! Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes--I can hear you, and you speak my language. But you--you will not\nhurt me? Where am I? This--this was my house a moment ago. I was\nliving here.\"\n\nDemented! It flashed to me. An insane girl, locked in this empty\nhouse. I gripped Larry; said to him: \"Take it easy; there's something\nqueer about this. We can't smash windows. Let's--\"\n\n\"You open the door,\" he called to the girl.\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"Why? Is it locked on the inside?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Because--oh, hurry! If he--if it comes again--!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe could see her turn to look behind her.\n\nLarry demanded, \"Are you alone in there?\"\n\n\"Yes--now. But, oh! a moment ago he was here!\"\n\n\"Then come to the door.\"\n\n\"I cannot. I don't know where it is. This is so strange and dark a\nplace. And yet it was my home, just a little time ago.\"\n\nDemented! And it seemed to me that her accent was very queer. A\nforeigner, perhaps.\n\nShe went suddenly into frantic fear. Her fists beat the window glass\nalmost hard enough to shatter it.\n\n\"We'd better get her out,\" I agreed. \"Smash it, Larry.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He waved at the girl. \"Get back. I'll break the glass. Get away\nso you won't get hurt.\"\n\nThe girl receded into the dimness.\n\n\"Watch your hand,\" I cautioned. Larry took off his coat and wrapped\nhis hand and the brick in it. I gazed behind us. The street was still\nempty. The slight commotion we had made had attracted no attention.\n\nThe girl cried out again as Larry smashed the pane. \"Easy,\" I called\nto her. \"Take it easy. We won't hurt you.\"\n\nThe splintering glass fell inward, and Larry pounded around the\ncasement until it was all clear. The rectangular opening was fairly\nlarge. We could see a dim basement room of dilapidated furniture: a\ndoor opening into a back room; the girl; nearby, a white shape\nwatching us.\n\nThere seemed no one else. \"Come on,\" I said. \"You can get out here.\"\n\nBut she backed away. I was half in the window so I swung my legs over\nthe sill. Larry came after me, and together we advanced on the girl,\nwho shrank before us.\n\nThen suddenly she ran to meet us, and I had the sudden feeling that\nshe was not insane. Her fear of us was overshadowed by her terror at\nsomething else in this dark, deserted house. The terror communicated\nitself to Larry and me. Something eery, here.\n\n\"Come on,\" Larry muttered. \"Let's get her out of here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had indeed no desire to investigate anything further. The girl let\nus help her through the window. I stood in the entryway holding her\narms. Her dress was of billowing white satin with a single red rose at\nthe breast; her snowy arms and shoulders were bare; white hair was\npiled high on her small head. Her face, still terrified, showed parted\nred lips; a little round black beauty patch adorned one of her\npowdered cheeks. The thought flashed to me that this was a girl in a\nfancy dress costume. This was a white wig she was wearing!\n\nI stood with the girl in the entryway, at a loss what to do. I held\nher soft warm arms; the perfume of her enveloped me.\n\n\"What do you want us to do with you?\" I demanded softly. McGuire, the\npoliceman on the block, might at any moment pass. \"We might get\narrested! What's the matter with you? Can't you explain? Are you\nhurt?\"\n\nShe was staring as though I were a ghost, or some strange animal. \"Oh,\ntake me away from this place! I will talk--though I do not know what\nto say--\"\n\nDemented or sane, I had no desire to have her fall into the clutches\nof the police. Nor could we very well take her to our apartment. But\nthere was my friend Dr. Alten, alienist, who lived within a mile of\nhere.\n\n\"We'll take her to Alten's,\" I said to Larry, \"and find out what this\nmeans. She isn't crazy.\"\n\nA sudden wild emotion swept me, then. Whatever this mystery, more than\nanything in the world I did not want the girl to be insane!\n\nLarry said, \"There was a taxi down the street.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt came, now, slowly along the deserted block. The chauffeur had\nperhaps heard us, and was cruising past to see if we were possible\nfares. He halted at the curb. The girl had quieted; but when she saw\nthe taxi her face registered wildest terror, and she shrank against\nme.\n\n\"No! No! Don't let it kill me!\"\n\nLarry and I were pulling her forward. \"What the devil's the matter\nwith you?\" Larry demanded again.\n\nShe was suddenly wildly fighting with us. \"No! That--that mechanism--\"\n\n\"Get her in it!\" Larry panted. \"We'll have the neighborhood on us!\"\n\nIt seemed the only thing to do. We flung her, scrambling and fighting,\ninto the taxi. To the half-frightened, reluctant driver, Larry said\nvigorously:\n\n\"It's all right; we're just taking her to a doctor. Hurry and get us\naway from here. There's good money in it for you!\"\n\nThe promise--and the reassurance of the physician's address--convinced\nthe chauffeur. We whirled off toward Washington Square.\n\nWithin the swaying taxi I sat holding the trembling girl. She was\nsobbing now, but quieting.\n\n\"There,\" I murmured. \"We won't hurt you; we're just taking you to a\ndoctor. You can explain to him. He's very intelligent.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said softly. \"Yes. Thank you. I'm all right now.\"\n\nShe relaxed against me. So beautiful, so dainty a creature.\n\nLarry leaned toward us. \"You're better now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's fine. You'll be all right. Don't think about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was convinced she was insane. I breathed again the vague hope that\nit might not be so. She was huddled against me. Her face, upturned to\nmine, had color in it now; red lips; a faint rose tint in the pale\ncheeks.\n\nShe murmured, \"Is this New York?\"\n\nMy heart sank. \"Yes,\" I answered. \"Of course it is.\"\n\n\"But when?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, what year?\"\n\n\"Why, 1935!\"\n\nShe caught her breath. \"And your name is--\"\n\n\"George Rankin.\"\n\n\"And I,\"--her laugh had a queer break in it--\"I am Mistress Mary\nAtwood. But just a few minutes ago--oh, am I dreaming? Surely I'm not\ninsane!\"\n\nLarry again leaned over us. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"You're friendly, you two. Like men; strange, so very strange-looking\nyoung men. This--this carriage without any horses--I know now it won't\nhurt me.\"\n\nShe sat up. \"Take me to your doctor. And then to the general of your\narmy. I must see him, and warn him. Warn you all.\" She was turning\nhalf hysterical again. She laughed wildly. \"Your general--he won't be\nGeneral Washington, of course. But I must warn him.\"\n\nShe gripped me. \"You think I am demented. But I am not. I am Mary\nAtwood, daughter of Major Charles Atwood, of General Washington's\nstaff. That was my home, where you broke the window. But it did not\nlook like that a few moments ago. You tell me this is the year 1935,\nbut just a few moments ago I was living in the year 1777!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_From Out of the Past_\n\n\"Sane?\" said Dr. Alten. \"Of course she's sane.\" He stood gazing down\nat Mary Atwood. He was a tall, slim fellow, this famous young\nalienist, with dark hair turning slightly grey at the temples and a\nneat black mustache that made him look older than he was. Dr. Alten at\nthis time, in spite of his eminence, had not yet turned forty.\n\n\"She's sane,\" he reiterated. \"Though from what you tell me, it's a\nwonder that she is.\" He smiled gently at the girl. \"If you don't mind,\nmy dear, tell us just what happened to you, as calmly as you can.\"\n\nShe sat by an electrolier in Dr. Alten's living room. The yellow light\ngleamed on her white satin dress, on her white shoulders, her\nbeautiful face with its little round black beauty patch, and the curls\nof the white wig dangling to her neck. From beneath the billowing,\nflounced skirt the two satin points of her slippers showed.\n\nA beauty of the year 1777! This thing so strange! I gazed at her with\nquickened pulse. It seemed that I was dreaming; that as I sat before\nher in my tweed business suit with its tubular trousers I was the\nanachronism! This should have been candle-light illumining us; I\nshould have been a powdered and bewigged gallant, in gorgeous satin\nand frilled shirt to match her dress. How strange, how futuristic we\nthree men of 1935 must have looked to her! And this city through which\nwe had whirled her in the throbbing taxi--no wonder she was\noverwrought.\n\nAlten fumbled in the pockets of his dressing gown for cigarettes. \"Go\nahead, Miss Mary. You are among friends. I promise we will try and\nunderstand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe smiled. \"Yes. I--I believe you.\" Her voice was low. She sat\nstaring at the floor, choosing her words carefully; and though she\nstumbled a little, her story was coherent. Upon the wings of her words\nmy fancy conjured that other Time-world, more than a hundred and fifty\nyears ago.\n\n\"I was at home to-night,\" she began. \"To-night after dinner. I have no\nrelatives except my father. He is General Washington's aide. We\nlive--our home is north of the city. I was alone, except for the\nservants.\n\n\"Father sent word to-night that he was coming to see me. The\nmessenger got through the British lines. But the redcoats are\neverywhere. They were quartered in our house. For months I have been\nlittle more than a servant to a dozen of My Lord's Howe's officers.\nThey are gentlemen, though: I have no complaint. Then they left, and\nfather, knowing it, wanted to come to see me.\n\n\"He should not have tried it. Our house is watched. He promised me he\nwould not wear the British red.\" She shuddered. \"Anything but that--to\nhave him executed as a spy. He would not risk that, but wear merely a\nlong black cloak.\n\n\"He was to come about ten o'clock. But at midnight there was no sign\nof him. The servants were asleep. I sat alone, and every pounding\nhoof-beat on the road matched my heart.\n\n\"Then I went into the garden. There was a dim moon in and out of the\nclouds. It was hot, like to-night. I mean, why it _was_ to-night. It's\nso strange--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the silence of Alten's living room we could hear the hurried\nticking of his little mantle clock, and from the street outside came\nthe roar of a passing elevated train and the honk of a taxi. This was\nNew York of 1935. But to me the crowding ghosts of the past were here.\nIn fancy I saw the white pillars of the moonlit Atwood home. A garden\nwith a dirt road beside it. Red-coated British soldiers passing....\nAnd to the south the little city of New York extending northward from\ncrooked Maiden Lane and the Bowling Green....\n\n\"Go on, Mistress Mary.\"\n\n\"I sat on a bench in the garden. And suddenly before me there was a\nwhite ghost. A shape. A wraith of something which a moment before had\nnot been there. I sat too frightened to move. I could not call out. I\ntried to, but the sound would not come.\n\n\"The shape was like a mist, a little ball of cloud in the center of\nthe garden lawn. Then in a second or two it was solid--a thing like a\nshining cage, with crisscrossing white bars. It was like a room; a\nmetal cage like a room. I thought that the thing was a phantom or that\nI was asleep and dreaming. But it was real.\"\n\nAlten interrupted. \"How big was it?\"\n\n\"As large as this room; perhaps larger. But it was square, and about\ntwice as high as a man.\"\n\nA cage, then, some twenty feet square and twelve feet high.\n\nShe went on: \"The cage door opened. I think I was standing, then, and\nI tried to run but could not. The--the _thing_ came from the door of\nthe cage and walked toward me. It was about ten feet tall. It\nlooked--oh, it looked like a man!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe buried her face in her hands. Again the room was silent. Larry was\nseated, staring at her; all of us were breathless.\n\n\"Like a man?\" Alten prompted gently.\n\n\"Yes; like a man.\" She raised her white face. This girl out of the\npast! Admiration for her swept me anew--she was bravely trying to\nsmile.\n\n\"Like a man. A thing with legs, a body, a great round head and swaying\narms. A jointed man of metal! You surely must know all about them.\"\n\n\"A Robot!\" Larry muttered.\n\n\"You have them here, I suppose. Like that rumbling carriage without\nhorses, this jointed iron man came walking toward me. And it spoke! A\nmost horrible hollow voice--but it seemed almost human. And what it\nsaid I do not know, for I fainted. I remember falling as it came\nwalking toward me, with stiff-jointed legs.\n\n\"When I came to my senses I was in the cage. Everything was humming and\nglowing. There was a glow outside the bars like a moonlit mist. The iron\nmonster was sitting at a table, with peculiar things--mechanical things--\"\n\n\"The controls of the cage-mechanisms,\" said Alten. \"How long were you\nin the cage?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Time seemed to stop. Everything was silent except the\nhumming noises. They were everywhere. I guess I was only half\nconscious. The monster sat motionless. In front of him were big round\nclock faces with whirling hands. Oh, I suppose you don't find this\nstrange; but to me--!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Could you see anything outside the cage?\" Alten persisted. \"No. Just\na fog. But it was crawling and shifting. Yes!--I remember now--I could\nnot see anything out there, but I had the thought, the feeling, that\nthere were tremendous things to see! The monster spoke again and told\nme to be careful; that we were going to stop. Its iron hands pulled at\nlevers. Then the humming grew fainter; died away; and I felt a shock.\n\n\"I thought I had fainted again. I could just remember being pulled\nthrough the cage door. The monster left me on the ground. It said,\n'Lie there, for I will return very soon.'\n\n\"The cage vanished. I saw a great cliff of stone near me; it had\nyellow-lighted openings, high up in the air. And big stone fences\nhemmed me in. Then I realized I was in an open space between a lot of\nstone houses. One towered like a cliff, or the side of a pyramid--\"\n\n\"The back yard of that house on Patton Place!\" Larry exclaimed. He\nlooked at me. \"Has it any back yard, George?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" I retorted. \"Probably has.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Alten was prompting.\n\n\"That is nearly all. I found a doorway leading to a dark room. I\ncrawled through it toward a glow of light. I passed through another\nroom. I thought I was in a nightmare, and that this was my home. I\nremembered that the cage had not moved. It had hardly lurched. Just\ntrembled; vibrated.\n\n\"But this was not my home. The rooms were small and dark. Then I\npeered through a window on a strange stone street. And saw these\nstrange-looking young men. And that is all--all I can tell you.\"\n\nShe had evidently held herself calm by a desperate effort. She broke\ndown now, sobbing without restraint.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Tugh, the Cripple_\n\nThe portals of this mystery had swung wide to receive us. The tumbling\nevents which menaced all our world of 1935 were upon us now. A\nmaelstrom. A torrent in the midst of which we were caught up like tiny\nbits of cork and whirled away.\n\nBut we thought we understood the mystery. We believed we were acting\nfor the best. What we did was no doubt ill-considered; but the human\nmind is so far from omniscient! And this thing was so strange!\n\nAlten said, \"You have a right to be overwrought, Mistress Mary Atwood.\nBut this thing is as strange to us as it is to you. I called that iron\nmonster a Robot. But it does not belong to our age: if it does I have\nnever seen one such as you describe. And traveling through Time--\"\n\nHe smiled down at her. \"That is not a commonplace everyday occurrence\nto us, I assure you. The difference is that in this world of ours we\ncan understand--or at least explain--these things as being scientific.\nAnd so they have not the terror of the supernatural.\"\n\nMary was calmer now. She returned his smile. \"I realize that; or at\nleast I am trying to realize it.\"\n\nWhat a level-headed girl was this! I touched her arm. \"You are very\nwonderful--\"\n\nAlten brushed me away. \"Let's try and reduce it to rationality. The\ncage was--is, I should say, since of course it still exists--that cage\nis a Time-traveling vehicle. It is traveling back and forth through\nTime, operated by a Robot. Call it that. A pseudo-human monster\nfashioned of metal in the guise of a man.\"\n\nEven Alten had to force himself to speak calmly, as he gazed from one\nto the other of us. \"It came, no doubt from some future age, where\nhalf-human mechanisms are common, and Time-traveling is known. That\ncage probably does not travel in Space, but only in Time. In the\nfuture--somewhere--the Space of that house on Patton Place may be the\nlaboratory of a famous scientist. And in the past--in the year\n1777--that same Space was the garden of Mistress Atwood's home. So\nmuch is obvious. But why--\"\n\n\"Why,\" Larry burst out, \"did that iron monster stop in 1777 and abduct\nthis girl?\"\n\n\"And why,\" I intercepted, \"did it stop here in 1935?\" I gazed at Mary.\n\"And it told you it would return?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlten was pondering. \"There must be some connection, of course....\nMistress Mary, had you never seen this cage before?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor anything like it? Was anything like that known to your Time?\"\n\n\"No. Oh, I cannot truly say that. Some people believe in phantoms,\nomens and witchcraft. There was in Salem, in the Massachusetts Colony,\nnot so many years ago--\"\n\n\"I don't mean that. I mean Time-traveling.\"\n\n\"There were soothsayers and fortune-tellers, and necromancers with\ncrystals to gaze into the future.\"\n\n\"We still have them,\" Alten smiled. \"You see, we don't know much more\nthan you do about this thing.\"\n\nI said, \"Did you have any enemy? Anyone who wished you harm?\"\n\nShe thought a moment. \"No--yes, there was one.\" She shuddered at the\nmemory. \"A man--a cripple--a horribly repulsive man of about one score\nand ten years. He lives down near the Battery.\" She paused.\n\n\"Tell us about him,\" Larry urged.\n\nShe nodded. \"But what could he have to do with this? He is horribly\ndeformed. Thin, bent legs, a body like a cask and a bulging forehead\nwith goggling eyes. My Lord Howe's officers say he is very intelligent\nand very learned. Loyal to the King, too. There was a munitions plot\nin the Bermudas, and this cripple and Lord Howe were concerned in it.\nBut Father likes the fellow and says that in reality he wishes our\ncause well. He is rich.\n\n\"But you don't want to hear all this. He--he made love to me, and I\nrepulsed him. There was a scene with Father, and Father had our\nlackeys throw him out. That was a year ago. He cursed horribly. He\nvowed then that some day he--he would have me; and get revenge on\nFather. But he has kept away. I have not seen him for a twelvemonth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were silent. I chanced to glance at Alten, and a strange look was\non his face.\n\nHe said abruptly, \"What is this cripple's name, Mistress Mary?\"\n\n\"Tugh. He is known to all the city as Tugh. Just that. I never heard\nany Christian name.\"\n\nAlten rose sharply to his feet. \"A cripple named Tugh?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she affirmed wonderingly. \"Does it mean anything to you?\"\n\nAlten swung on me. \"What is the number of that house on Patton Place?\nDid you happen to notice?\"\n\nI had, and wondering I told him.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" he said. \"I want to use the phone.\"\n\nHe came back to us in a moment: his face was very solemn. \"That house\non Patton Place is owned by a man named Tugh! I just called a reporter\nfriend; he remembers a certain case: he confirmed what I thought.\nMistress Mary, did this Tugh in your Time ever consult doctors, trying\nto have his crippled body made whole?\"\n\n\"Why, of course he did. I have heard that many times. But his\ncrippled, deformed body cannot be cured.\"\n\nAlten checked Larry and me when we would have broken in with\nastonished questions. He said:\n\n\"Don't ask me what it means; I don't know. But I think that this\ncripple--this Tugh--has lived both in 1777 and 1935, and is traveling\nbetween them in this Time-traveling cage. And perhaps he is the human\nmaster of that Robot.\"\n\nAlten made a vehement gesture. \"But we'd better not theorize; it's too\nfantastic. Here is the story of Tugh in our Time. He came to me some\nthree years ago; in 1932, I think. He offered any price if I could\ncure his crippled body. All the New York medical fraternity knew him.\nHe seemed sane, but obsessed with the idea that he must have a body\nlike other men. Like Faust, who, as an old man, paid the price of his\nsoul to become youthful, he wanted to have the beautiful body of a\nyoung man.\"\n\nAlten was speaking vehemently. My thoughts ran ahead of his words; I\ncould imagine with grewsome fancy so many things. A cripple, traveling\nto different ages seeking to be cured. Desiring a different body....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlten was saying, \"This fellow Tugh lived alone in that house on\nPatton Place. He was all you say of him, Mistress Mary. Hideously\nrepulsive. A sinister personality. About thirty years old.\n\n\"And, in 1932, he got mixed up with a girl who had a somewhat dubious\nreputation herself. A dancer, a frequenter of night-clubs, as they\nused to be called. Her name was Doris Johns--something like that. She\nevidently thought she could get money out of Tugh. Whatever it was,\nthere was a big uproar. The girl had him arrested, saying that he had\nassaulted her. The police had quite a time with the cripple.\"\n\nLarry and I remembered a few of the details of it now, though neither\nof us had been in New York at the time.\n\nAlten went on: \"Tugh fought with the police. Went berserk. I imagine\nthey handled him pretty roughly. In the Magistrate's Court he made\nanother scene, and fought with the court attendants. With ungovernable\nrage he screamed vituperatives, and was carried kicking, biting and\nsnarling from the court-room. He threatened some wild weird revenge\nupon all the city officials--even upon the city itself.\"\n\n\"Nice sort of chap,\" Larry commented.\n\nBut Alten did not smile. \"The Magistrate could only hold him for\ncontempt of Court. The girl had absolutely no evidence to support her\naccusation of assault. Tugh was finally dismissed. A week later he\nmurdered the girl.\n\n\"The details are unimportant; but he did it. The police had him\ntrapped in his house; had the house surrounded--this same one on\nPatton Place--but when they burst in to take him, he had inexplicably\nvanished. He was never heard from again.\"\n\nAlten continued to regard us with grim, solemn face. \"Never heard\nfrom--until to-night. And now we hear of him. How he vanished, with\nthe police guarding every exit to that house--well, it's obvious,\nisn't it? He went into another Time-world. Back to 1777, doubtless.\"\n\nMary Atwood gave a little cry. \"I had forgotten that I must warn you.\nTugh told me once, before Father and I quarreled with him, that he had\na mysterious power. He was a most wonderful man, he said. And there\nwas a world in the future--he mentioned 1934 or 1935--which he hated.\nA great city whose people had wronged him; and he was going to bring\ndeath to them. Death to them all! I did not heed him. I thought he was\ndemented, raving....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlten's little clock ticked with tumultuous heartbeat through another\nsilence. The great city around us, even though this was two o'clock\nin the morning, throbbed with a myriad of blended sounds.\n\nA warning! Was the girl from out of the past giving us a warning of\ncoming disaster to this great city?\n\nAlten was pacing the floor. \"What are we to do--tell the authorities?\nTake Mistress Mary Atwood to Police Headquarters and inform them that\nshe has come from the year 1777? And that, if we are not careful,\nthere will be an attack upon New York?\"\n\n\"No!\" I burst out. I could fancy how we would be received at Police\nHeadquarters if we did that! And our pictures in to-morrow's\nnewspapers. Mary's picture, with a jibing headline ridiculing us.\n\n\"No,\" echoed Alten. \"I have no intention of doing it. I'm not so\nfoolish as that.\" He stopped before Mary. \"What do you want to do?\nYou're obviously an exceptionally intelligent, level-headed girl.\nHeaven knows you need to be.\"\n\n\"I--I want to get back home,\" she stammered.\n\nA pang shot through me as she said it. A hundred and fifty years to\nseparate us. A vast gulf. An impassible barrier.\n\n\"That mechanism said it would return!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" agreed Alten. An excitement was upon us all. \"Exactly what\nI mean! Shall we chance it? Try it? There's nothing else I can think\nof to do. I have a revolver and two hunting rifles.\"\n\n\"Just what do you mean?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I mean, we'll take my car and go to Tugh's house on Patton Place.\nRight now! And if that mechanical monster returns, we'll seize it!\"\n\nAlten, the usually calm, precise man of science, was tensely vehement.\n\"Seize it! Why not? Three of us, armed, ought to be able to overcome a\nRobot! Then we'll seize the Time-traveling cage. Perhaps we can\noperate it. If not, with it in our possession we'll at least have\nsomething to show the authorities; there'll be no ridicule then!\"\n\nOur inescapable destiny was making us plunge so rashly into this\nmystery! With the excitement and the strange fantasy of it upon us, we\nthought we were acting for the best.\n\nWithin a quarter of an hour, armed and with a long overcoat and a\nscarf to hide Mary Atwood's beauty, we took Alten's car and drove to\nPatton Place.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Fight With the Robot_\n\nPatrolman McGuire quite evidently had not passed through Patton Place\nsince we left it; or at least he had not noticed the broken window.\nThe house appeared as before, dark, silent, deserted, and the broken\nbasement window yawned with its wide black opening.\n\n\"I'll leave the car around on the other street,\" Alten said as slowly\nwe passed the house. \"Quick--no one's in sight; you three get out\nhere.\"\n\nWe crouched in the dim entryway and in a moment he joined us.\n\nI clung to Mary Atwood's arm. \"You're not afraid?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. Yes; of course I am afraid. But I want to do what we planned. I\nwant to go back to my own world, to my Father.\"\n\n\"Inside!\" Alten whispered. \"I'll go first. You two follow with her.\"\n\nI can say now that we should not have taken her into that house. It is\nso easy to look back upon what one might have done!\n\nWe climbed through the window, into the dark front basement room.\nThere was only silence, and our faintly padding footsteps on the\ncarpeted floor. The furniture was shrouded with cotton covers standing\nlike ghosts in the gloom. I clutched the loaded rifle which Alten had\ngiven me. Larry was similarly armed; and Alten carried a revolver.\n\n\"Which way, Mary?\" I whispered. \"You're sure it was outdoors?\"\n\n\"Yes. This way, I think.\"\n\nWe passed through the connecting door. The back room seemed to be a\ndismantled kitchen.\n\n\"You stay with her here, a moment,\" Alten whispered to me. \"Come on,\nLarry. Let's make sure no one--nothing--is down here.\"\n\nI stood silent with Mary, while they prowled about the lower floor.\n\n\"It may have come and gone,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Yes.\" She was trembling against me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to me an eternity while we stood there listening to the\nfaint footfalls of Larry and Alten. Once they must have stood quiet;\nthen the silence leaped and crowded us. It is horrible to listen to a\npregnant silence which every moment might be split by some weird\nunearthly sound.\n\nLarry and Alten returned. \"Seems to be all clear,\" Alten whispered.\n\"Let's go into the back yard.\"\n\nThe little yard was dim. The big apartment house against its rear wall\nloomed with a blank brick face, save that there were windows some\neight stories up. Only a few windows overlooked this dim area with its\nhigh enclosing walls. The space was some forty feet square, and there\nwas a faded grass plot in the center.\n\nWe crouched near the kitchen door, with Mary behind us in the room.\nShe said she could recall the cage having stood near the center of the\nyard, with its door facing this way....\n\nNearly an hour passed. It seemed that the dawn must be near, but it\nwas only around four o'clock. The same storm clouds hung overhead--a\nthreatening storm which would not break. The heat was oppressing.\n\n\"It's come and gone,\" Larry whispered; \"or it isn't coming. I guess\nthat this--\"\n\nAnd then it came! We were just outside the doorway, crouching against\nthe shadowed wall of the house. I had Mary close behind me, my rifle\nready.\n\n\"There!\" whispered Alten.\n\nWe all saw it--a faint luminous mist out near the center of the\nyard--a crawling, shifting ball of fog.\n\nAlten and Larry, one on each side of me, shifted sidewise, away from\nme. Mary stood and cast off her dark overcoat. We men were in dark\nclothes, but she stood in gleaming white against the dark rectangle of\ndoorway. It was as we had arranged. A moment only, she stood there;\nthen she moved back, further behind me in the black kitchen.\n\nAnd in that moment the cage had materialized. We were hoping its\noccupant had seen the girl, and not us. A breathless moment passed\nwhile we stared for the first time at this strange thing from the\nUnknown.... A formless, glowing mist, it quickly gathered itself into\nsolidity. It seemed to shrink. It took form. From a wraith of a cage,\nin a second it was solid. And so silently, so swiftly, came this thing\nout of Time into what we call the Present! The dim yard a second ago\nhad been empty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cage stood there, a thing of gleaming silver bars. It seemed to\nenclose a single room. From within its dim interior came a faint glow,\nwhich outlined something standing at the bars, peering out.\n\nThe doorway was facing us. There had been utter silence; but suddenly,\nas though to prove how solid was this apparition, we heard the clank\nof metal, and the door slid open.\n\nI turned to make sure that Mary was hiding well behind me. The way\nback to the street, if need for escape arose, was open to her.\n\nI turned again, to face the shining cage. In the doorway something\nstood peering out, a light behind it. It was a great jointed thing of\ndark metal some ten feet high. For a moment it stood motionless. I\ncould not see its face clearly, though I knew there was a suggestion\nof human features, and two great round glowing spots of eyes.\n\nIt stepped forward--toward us. A jointed, stiff-legged step. Its arms\nwere dangling loosely; I heard one of its mailed hands clank against\nits sides.\n\n\"Now!\" Alten whispered.\n\nI saw Alten's revolver leveling, and my own rifle went up.\n\n\"Aim at its face,\" I murmured.\n\nWe pulled our triggers together, and two spurts of flame spat before\nus. But the thing had stooped an instant before, and we missed. Then\ncame Larry's shot. And then chaos.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI recall hearing the ping of Larry's bullet against the mailed body of\nthe Robot. At that it crouched, and from it leaped a dull red-black\nbeam of light. I heard Mary scream. She had not fled but was clinging\nto me. I cast her off.\n\n\"Run! Get back! Get away!\" I cried.\n\nLarry shouted, as we all stood bathed in the dull light from the\nRobot:\n\n\"Look out! It sees us!\"\n\nHe fired again, into the light--and murmured, \"Why--why--\"\n\nA great surprise and terror was in his tone. Beside me, with\nhalf-leveled revolver, Alten stood transfixed. And he too was\nmuttering something.\n\nAll this happened in an instant. And there I was aware that I was\ntrying to get my rifle up for firing again; but I could not. My arms\nstiffened. I tried to take a step, tried to move a foot, but could\nnot. I was rooted there; held, as though by some giant magnet, to the\nground!\n\nThis horrible dull-red light! It was cold--a frigid, paralyzing blast.\nThe blood ran like cold water in my veins. My feet were heavy with the\nweight of my body pressing them down.\n\nThen the Robot was moving; coming forward; holding the light upon us.\nI thought I heard its voice--and a horrible, hollow, rasping laugh.\n\nMy brain was chilling. I had confused thoughts; impressions, vague and\ndreamlike. As though in a dream I felt myself standing there with\nMary clinging to me. Both of us were frozen inert upon our feet.\n\nI tried to shout, but my tongue was too thick; my throat seemed\nswelling inside. I heard Alten's revolver clatter to the stone\npavement of the yard. And saw him fall forward--out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI felt that in another instant I too would fall. This damnable,\nchilling light! Then the beam turned partly away, and fell more fully\nupon Larry. With his youth and greater strength than Alten's or mine,\nhe had resisted its first blast. His weapon had fallen; now he stooped\nand tried to seize it; but he lost his balance and staggered backward\nagainst the house wall.\n\nAnd then the Robot was upon him. It sprang--this mechanism!--this\nmachine in human form! And, with whatever pseudo-human intelligence\nactuated its giant metal body, it reached under Larry for his rifle!\nIts great mailed hand swept the ground, seized the rifle and flung it\naway. And as Larry twisted sidewise, the Robot's arm with a sweep\ncaught him and rolled him across the yard. When he stopped, he lay\nmotionless.\n\nI heard myself thickly calling to Mary, and the light flashed again\nupon us. And then we fell forward. Clinging together, we fell....\n\nI did not quite lose consciousness. It seemed that I was frozen, and\ndrifting off half into a nightmare sleep. Great metal arms were\ngathering Mary and me from the ground. Lifting us; carrying us....\n\nWe were in the cage. I felt myself lying on the grid of a metal floor.\nI could vaguely see the crossed bars of the ceiling overhead, and the\nlatticed walls around me....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the dull-red light was gone. The chill was gone. I was warming.\nThe blessed warm blood again was coursing through my veins, reviving\nme, bringing back my strength.\n\nI turned over, and found Mary lying beside me. I heard her softly\nmurmur:\n\n\"George! George Rankin!\"\n\nThe giant mechanism clanked the door closed, and came with stiff,\nstilted steps back into the center of the cage. I heard the hollow\nrumble of its voice, chuckling, as its hand pulled a switch.\n\nAt once the cage-room seemed to reel. It was not a physical movement,\nthough, but more a reeling of my senses, a wild shock to all my being.\n\nThen, after a nameless interval, I steadied. Around me was a humming,\nglowing intensity of tiny sounds and infinitely small, infinitely\nrapid vibrations. The whole room grew luminous. The Robot, seated now\nat a table, showed for a moment as thin as an apparition. All this\nroom--Mary lying beside me, the mechanism, myself--all this was\nimponderable, intangible, unreal.\n\nAnd outside the bars stretched a shining mist of movement. Blurred\nshifting shapes over a vast illimitable vista. Changing things;\nmelting landscapes. Silent, tumbling, crowding events blurred by our\nmovement as we swept past them.\n\nWe were traveling through Time!\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Girl from 2930_\n\nI must take up now the sequence of events as Larry saw them. I was\nseparated from Larry during most of the strange incidents which befell\nus later; but from his subsequent account of what happened to him I am\nconstructing several portions of this history, using my own words\nbased upon Larry's description of the events in which I personally did\nnot participate; I think that this method avoids complications in the\nnarrative and makes more clear my own and Larry's simultaneous\nactions.\n\nLarry recovered consciousness in the back yard of the house on Patton\nPlace probably only a moment or two after Mary and I had been snatched\naway in the Time-traveling cage. He found himself bruised and\nbattered, but apparently without injuries. He got to his feet, weak\nand shaken. His head was roaring.\n\nHe recalled what had happened to him, but it seemed like a dream. The\nback yard was then empty. He remembered vaguely that he had seen the\nmechanism carry Mary and me into the cage, and that the cage had\nvanished.\n\nLarry knew that only a few moments had passed. The shots had aroused\nthe neighborhood. As he stood now against the house wall, dizzily\nlooking around, he was aware of calling voices from the nearby\nwindows.\n\nThen Larry stumbled over Alten, who was lying on his face near the\nkitchen doorway. Still alive, he groaned as Larry fell over him; but\nhe was unconscious.\n\nForgetting all about his weapon, Larry's first thought was to rush out\nfor help. He staggered through the dark kitchen into the front room,\nand through the corridor into the street.\n\nPatton Place, as before, was deserted. The houses were dark; the alarm\nwas all in the rear. There were no pedestrians, no vehicles, and no\nsign of a policeman. Dawn was just coming; as Larry turned eastward he\nsaw, in a patch of clearing sky, stars paling with the coming\ndaylight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith uncertain steps, out in the middle of the street, Larry ran\neastward through the middle of the street, hoping that at the next\ncorner he might encounter someone, or find a telephone over which he\nmight call the police.\n\nBut he had not gone more than five hundred feet when suddenly he\nstopped; stood there wavering, panting, staring with whirling senses.\nNear the middle of the street, with the faint dawn behind it, a ball\nof gathering mist had appeared directly in his path. It was a\nluminous, shining mist--and it was gathering into form!\n\nIn seconds a small, glowing cage of white luminous bars stood there in\nthe street, where there had just been nothing! It was not the\nTime-traveling cage from the house yard he had just left. No--he knew\nit was not that one. This one was similar, but much smaller.\n\nThe shock of its appearance held Larry for a moment transfixed. It had\nso silently, so suddenly appeared in his path that Larry was now\nwithin a foot or two of its doorway.\n\nThe doorway slid open, and a man leaped out. Behind him, a girl peered\nfrom the doorway. Larry stood gaping, wholly confused. The cage had\nmaterialized so abruptly that the leaping man collided with him before\neither man could avoid the other. Larry gripped the man before him;\nstruck out with his fists and shouted. The girl in the doorway called\nfrantically:\n\n\"Harl-no noise! Harl-stop him!\"\n\nThen, suddenly the two of them were upon Larry and pulling him toward\nthe doorway of the cage. Inside, he was jerked; he shouted wildly; but\nthe girl slammed the door. Then in a soft, girlish voice, in English\nwith a curiously indescribable accent and intonation, the girl said\nhastily:\n\n\"Hold him, Harl! Hold him! I'll start the traveler!\"\n\nThe black garbed figure of a slim young man was gripping Larry as the\ngirl pulled a switch and there was a shock, a reeling of Larry's\nsenses, as the cage, motionless in Space, sped off into Time....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems needless to encumber this narrative with prolonged details of\nhow Larry explained himself to his two captors. Or how they told him\nwho they were; and from whence they had come; and why. To Larry it was\na fantastic--and confusing at first--series of questions and answers.\nAn hour? The words have no meaning. They were traveling through Time.\nYears were minutes--the words meaning nothing save how they impressed\nthe vehicle's human occupants. To them all it was an interval of\nmutual distrust which was gradually changing into friendship. Larry\nfound the two strangers singularly direct; singularly forceful in\nquiet, calm fashion; singularly keen of perception. They had not meant\nto capture him. The encounter had startled them, and Larry's shouts\nwould have brought others upon the scene.\n\nAlmost at once they knew Larry was no enemy, and told him so. And in a\nmoment Larry was pouring out all that had happened to him; and to\nAlten and Mary Atwood and me. This strange thing! But to Larry now,\ntelling it to these strange new companions, it abruptly seemed not\nfantastic, but only sinister. The Robot, an enemy, had captured Mary\nAtwood and me, and whirled us off in the other--the larger--cage.\n\nAnd in this smaller cage Larry was with friends--for he suddenly found\ntheir purpose the same as his! They were chasing this other\nTime-traveler, with its semi-human, mechanical operator!\n\nThe young man said, \"You explain to him, Tina. I will watch.\"\n\nHe was a slim, pale fellow, handsome in a queer, tight-lipped,\nstern-faced fashion. His close-fitting black silk jacket had a white\nneck ruching and white cuffs; he wore a wide white-silk belt, snug\nblack-silk knee-length trousers and black stockings.\n\nAnd the girl was similarly dressed. Her black hair was braided and\ncoiled upon her head, and ornaments dangled from her ears. Over her\nblack blouse was a brocaded network jacket; her white belt,\ncompressing her slim waist, dangled with tassels; and there were other\ntassels on the garters at the knees of her trousers.\n\nShe was a pale-faced, beautiful girl, with black brows arching in a\nthin line, with purple-black eyes like somber pools. She was no more\nthan five feet tall, and slim and frail. But, like her companion,\nthere was about her a queer aspect of calm, quiet power and force of\npersonality--physical vitality merged with an intellect keenly sharp.\n\nShe sat with Larry on a little metal bench, listening, almost without\ninterruption, to his explanation. And then, succinctly she gave her\nown. The young man, Harl, sat at his instruments, with his gaze\nsearching for the other cage, five hundred feet away in Space, but in\nTime unknown.\n\nAnd outside the shining bars Larry could vaguely see the blurred,\nshifting, melting vistas of New York City hastening through the\nchanges Time had brought to it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis young man, Harl, and this girl, Tina, lived in New York City in\nthe Time-world of 2930 A. D. To Larry it was a thousand years in the\nfuture. Tina was the Princess of the American Nation. It was an\nhereditary title, non-political, added several hundred years\npreviously as a picturesque symbol. A tradition; something to make\nless prosaic the political machine of Republican government. Tina was\nloved by her people, we afterward came to learn.\n\nHarl was an aristocrat of the New York City of Tina's Time-world, a\nscientist. In the Government laboratories, under the same roof where\nTina dwelt, Harl had worked with another, older scientist, and--so\nTina told me--together they had discovered the secret of\nTime-traveling. They had built two cages, a large and a small, which\ncould travel freely through Time.\n\nThe smaller vehicle--this one in which Larry now was speeding--was, in\nthe Time-world of 2930, located in the garden of Tina's palace. The\nother, somewhat larger, they had built some five hundred feet distant,\njust beyond the palace walls, within a great Government laboratory.\n\nHarl's fellow scientist--the leader in their endeavors, since he was\nmuch older and of wider experience--was not altogether trusted by\nTina. He took the credit for the discovery of Time-traveling; yet,\nsaid Tina, it was Harl's genius which in reality had worked out the\nfinal problems.\n\nAnd this older scientist was a cripple. A hideously repulsive fellow,\nnamed Tugh!\n\n\"Tugh!\" exclaimed Larry.\n\n\"The same,\" said Tina in her crisp fashion. \"Yes--undoubtedly the\nsame. So you see why what you have told us was of such interest. Tugh\nis a Government leader in our world; and now we find he has lived in\n_your_ Time, and in the Time of this Mary Atwood.\"\n\nFrom his seat at the instrument table, Harl burst out: \"So he murdered\na girl of 1935, and has abducted another of 1777? You would not have\nme judge him, Tina--\"\n\n\"No one,\" she said, \"may judge without full facts. This man here--this\nLarry of 1935--tells us that only a mechanism is in the larger\ncage--which is what we thought, Harl. And this mechanism, without a\ndoubt, is the treacherous Migul.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was, in 2930, a vast world of machinery. The god of the machine\nhad developed them to almost human intricacy. Almost all the work of\nthe world, particularly in America, and most particularly in the\nmechanical center of New York City, was done by machinery. And the\nmachinery itself was guided, handled, operated--even, in some\ninstances, constructed--by other, more intricate machines. They were\nfashioned in pseudo-human form--thinking, logically acting,\nindependently acting mechanisms: the Robots. All but human, they\nwere--a new race. Inferior to humans, yet similar.\n\nAnd in 2930 the machines, slaves of idle human masters, had been\ndeveloped too highly! They were upon the verge of a revolt!\n\nAll this Tina briefly sketched now to Larry. And to Larry it seemed a\nvery distant, very academic danger. Yet so soon all of us were plunged\ninto the midst of it!\n\nThe revolt had not yet come, but it was feared. A great Robot named\nMigul seemed fomenting it. The revolt was smouldering; at any moment\nit would burst; and then the machines would rise to destroy the\nhumans.\n\nThis was the situation when Harl and Tugh completed the Time-traveling\nvehicles in this world. They had been tested, but never used. Then\nTugh had vanished; was gone now; and the larger of the two vehicles\nwas also gone.\n\nBoth Harl and Tina had always distrusted Tugh. They thought him allied\nto the Robots. But they had no proof; and suavely he denied it, and\nhelped always with the Government activities struggling to keep the\nmechanical slaves docile and at work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTugh and the larger vehicle had vanished, and so had Migul, the\ninsubordinate, giant mechanism--at which, unknown to the Government\nofficials, Tina and Harl had taken the other cage and started in\npursuit. It was possible that Tugh was loyal; that Migul had abducted\nhim and stolen the cage.\n\n\"Wait!\" exclaimed Larry. \"I'm trying to figure this out. It seems to\nhang together. It almost does, but not quite. When did Tugh vanish\nfrom your world?\"\n\n\"To our consciousness,\" Tina answered, \"about three hours ago. Perhaps\na little longer than that.\"\n\n\"But look here,\" Larry protested: \"according to my story and that of\nMary Atwood, Tugh lived in 1935 and in 1777 for three years.\"\n\nConfusing? But in a moment Larry understood it. Tugh could have taken\nthe cage, gone to 1777 and to 1935, alternated between them for what\nwas to him, and to those Time-worlds, three years--then have returned\nto 2930 _on the same day of his departure_. He would have lived these\nthree years; grown that much older; but to the Time-world of 2930\nneither he nor the cage would have been missed.\n\n\"That,\" said Tina, \"is what doubtless he did. The cage is traveling\nagain. But you, Larry, tell us only Migul is in it.\"\n\n\"I couldn't say that of my own knowledge,\" said Larry. \"Mary Atwood\nsaid so. It held only the mechanism you call Migul. And now Migul has\nwith him Mary and my friend George Rankin. We must reach them.\"\n\n\"We want that quite as much as you do,\" said Harl. \"And to find Tugh.\nIf he is a friend we must save him; if a traitor--punish him.\"\n\nLarry began, \"But can you get to the other cage?\"\n\n\"Only if it stops,\" said Tina. \"_When_ it stops, I should say.\"\n\n\"Come here,\" said Harl. \"I will show you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLarry crossed the glowing room. He had forgotten its aspect--the\nghostly unreality around him. He too--his body, like Harl's and\nTina's--was of the same wraith-like substance.... Then, suddenly,\nLarry's viewpoint shifted. The room and its occupants were real and\ntangible. And outside the glowing bars--everything out there was the\nunreality.\n\n\"Here,\" said Harl. \"I will show you. It is not visible yet.\"\n\nEach of the cages was equipped with an intricate device, strange of\nname, which Larry and I have since termed a Time-telespectroscope.\nLarry saw it now as a small metal box, with tuning vibration dials,\nbatteries, coils, a series of tiny prisms and an image-mirror--the\nwhole surmounted by what appeared the barrel of a small telescope.\nHarl had it leveled and was gazing through it.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: The workings of the Time-telespectroscope involve all the\nintricate postulates and mathematical formulae of Time-traveling\nitself. As a matter of practicality, however, the results obtained are\nsimple of understanding. The etheric vibratory rate of the vehicles\nwhile traveling through Time was constantly changing. Through the\ntelespectroscope one cage was visible to the other across the five\nhundred feet of intervening Space when they approached a simultaneous\nTime; when they, so to speak, were tuned in unison.\n\nThus, Harl explained, the other cage would show as a ghost, the\nfaintest of wraiths, over a Time-distance of some five or ten years.\nAnd the closer in Time they approached it, the more solid it would\nappear.]\n\nThe enemy cage was not visible, now. But Harl and Tina had glimpsed it\non several occasions. What vast realms Time opens within a single\nsmall segment of Space! The larger vehicle seemed speeding back and\nforth. A dash into the year 1777! as Larry learned from Mary Atwood.\n\nAnd there had been several evidences of the cage halting in 1935.\nLarry's account explained two such pauses. But the others? Those\nothers, which brought to the City of New York such amazing disaster?\nWe did not learn of them until much later. But Alten lived through\nthem, and presently I shall reconstruct them from his account.\n\nThe larger cage was difficult to trace in its sweep along the\ncorridors of Time. Never once had Tina and Harl been able to stop\nsimultaneously with it, for a year has so many separate days and\nhours. The nearest they came was the halt in the night of June 8-9,\nwhen they encountered Larry, and, startled, seized him and moved on\nagain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarl continued to gaze through the eyepiece of the detecting\ninstrument. But nothing showed, and the mirror-grid on the table was\ndark.\n\n\"But--which way are we going?\" Larry stammered.\n\n\"Back,\" said Tina. \"The retrograde.... Wait! Do not do that!\"\n\nLarry had turned toward where the bars, less luminous, showed a dark\nrectangle like a window. The desire swept him to gaze out at the\nshining, changing scene.\n\nBut Tina checked him. \"Do not do that! Not yet! It is too great a\nshock in the retrograde. It was to me.\"\n\n\"But where are we?\"\n\nIn answer she gestured toward a series of tiny dials on the table\nedge. There were at least two score of them, laid in a triple bank.\nDials to record the passing minutes, hours, days; the years, the\ncenturies! Larry stared at the small whirring pointers. Some were a\nblur of swift whirling movement--the hours and days. Tina showed Larry\nhow to read them. The cage was passing through the year 1880. In a few\nmoments of Larry's consciousness it was 1799. Then 1793. The infant\nAmerican nation was here now. But with the cage retrograding, soon\nthey would be in the Revolutionary War.\n\nTina said. \"The other cage may go back to 1777, if Tugh meant ill to\nMary Atwood, or wants revenge upon her father, at you said. We shall\nsee.\"\n\nThey had reached 1790 when Harl gave a low ejaculation.\n\n\"You see it?\" Tina murmured.\n\n\"Yes. Very faintly.\"\n\nLarry bent tensely forward. \"Will it show on the mirror?\"\n\n\"Yes; presently. We are about ten years from it. If we get closer, the\nmirror will show it.\"\n\nBut the mirror held dark. No--now it was glowing a trifle. A vague\nluminosity.\n\nTina moved toward the instrument controls nearby. \"Watch closely,\nHarl. I will slow us down.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to Larry that the humming with which everything around him\nwas endowed, now began descending in pitch. And his head suddenly was\nunsteady. A singular, wild, queer feeling was within him. An unrest. A\ntugging torment of every tiny cell of his body.\n\nTina said. \"Hold steady, Larry, for when we stop.\"\n\n\"Will it shock me?\"\n\n\"Yes--at first. But the shock will not harm you: it is nearly all\nmental.\"\n\nThe mirror held an image now--the other cage. Larry saw, on the\nsix-inch square mirror surface, a crawling, melting scene of movement.\nAnd in the midst of it, the image of the other cage, faint and\nspectral. In all the mirrored movement, only the apparition of the\ncage was still. And this marked it; made it visible.\n\nOver an interval, while Larry stared, the ghostly image grew plainer.\nThey were approaching its Time-factor!\n\n\"It is stopping,\" Harl murmured. Larry was aware that he had left the\neyepiece and joined Tina at the controls.\n\n\"Tina, let us try to get it right this time.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In 1777; but which month, would you say?\"\n\n\"It has stopped! See?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLarry heard them clicking switches, and setting the controls for a\nstop. Then he felt Tina gently push him.\n\n\"Sit here. Standing, you might fall.\"\n\nHe found himself on a bench. He could still see the mirror. The ghost\nof the other cage was now lined more plainly upon it.\n\n\"This month,\" said Tina, setting a switch. \"Would not you say so? And\nthis day.\"\n\n\"But the hour, Tina? The minute?\"\n\nThe vast intricate corridors of Time!\n\n\"It would be in the night. Hasten, Harl, or we will pass! Try the\nnight--around midnight. Even Migul has the mechanical intelligence to\nfear a daylight pausing.\"\n\nThe controls were set for the stop. Larry heard Tina murmuring, \"Oh, I\npray we may have judged with correctness!\"\n\nThe vehicle was rapidly coming to a stop. Larry gripped the table,\nstruggling to hold firm to his reeling senses. This soundless,\ngrinding halt! His swaying gaze strayed from the mirror. Outside the\nglowing bars he could now discern the luminous greyness separating.\nSwift, soundless claps of light and dark, alternating. Daylight and\ndarkness. They had been blended, but now they were separating. The\npassing, retrograding days--a dozen to the second of Larry's\nconsciousness. Then fewer. Vivid daylight. Black night. Daylight\nagain.\n\n\"Not too slowly, Harl; we will be seen!... Oh, it is gone!\"\n\nLarry saw the mirror go blank. The image on it had flared to great\ndistinctness, faded, and was gone. Darkness was around Larry. Then\ndaylight. Then darkness again.\n\n\"Gone!\" echoed Harl's disappointed voice. \"But it stopped here!...\nShall we stop, Tina?\"\n\n\"Yes! Leave the control settings as they are. Larry--be careful, now.\"\n\nA dragging second of grey daylight. A plunge into night. It seemed to\nLarry that all the universe was soundlessly reeling. Out of the chaos,\nTina was saying:\n\n\"We have stopped. Are you all right, Larry?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he stammered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood up. The cage room, with its faint lights, benches and\nsettles, instrument tables and banks of controls, was flooded with\nmoonlight from outside the bars. Night, and the moon and stars out\nthere.\n\nHarl slid the door open. \"Come, let us look.\"\n\nThe reeling chaos had fallen swiftly from Larry. With Tina's small\nblack and white figure beside him, he stood at the threshold of the\ncage. A warm gentle night breeze fanned his face.\n\nA moonlit landscape lay somnolent around the cage. Trees were nearby.\nThe cage stood in a corner of a field by a low picket fence. Behind\nthe trees, a ribbon of road stretched away toward a distant shining\nriver. Down the road some five hundred feet, the white columns of a\nlarge square brick house gleamed in the moonlight. And behind the\nhouse was a garden and a group of barns and stables.\n\nThe three in the cage doorway stood whispering, planning. Then two of\nthem stepped to the ground. They were Larry and Tina; Harl remained to\nguard the cage.\n\nThe two figures on the ground paused a moment and then moved\ncautiously along the inside line of the fence toward the home of Major\nAtwood. Strange anachronisms, these two prowling figures! A girl from\nthe year 2930; a man from 1935!\n\nAnd this was revolutionary New York, now. The little city lay well to\nthe south. It was open country up here. The New York of 1935 had\nmelted away and was gone....\n\nThis was a night in August of 1777.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The New York Massacre of 1935_\n\nDr. Alten recovered consciousness in the back yard of the house on\nPatton Place just a few moments after Larry had encountered the\nsmaller Time-traveling cage and been carried off by Harl and Tina.\nPreviously to that, of course, the mysterious mechanism in the guise\nof a giant man had abducted Mary Atwood and me in the larger\nTime-cage.\n\nAlten became aware that people were bending over him. The shots we had\ntaken at the Robot had aroused the neighborhood. A policeman arrived.\n\nThe sleeping neighbors had heard the shots, but it seemed that none\nhad seen the cage, or the metal man who had come from it. Alten said\nnothing. He was taken to the nearest police station where grudgingly,\nhe told his story. He was laughed at; reprimanded for alcoholism.\nEvidently, according to the police sergeant, there had been a fight,\nand Alten had drawn the loser's end. The police confiscated the two\nrifles and the revolver and decided that no one but Alten had been\nhurt. But at best it was a queer affair. Alten had not been shot; he\nwas just stiff with cold; he said a dull-red ray had fallen upon him\nand stiffened him with its frigid blast. Utter nonsense!\n\nDr. Alten was a man of standing. It was a reprehensible affair, but he\nwas released upon his own recognizance. He was charged with breaking\ninto the untenanted home of one Tugh; of illegally possessing\nfirearms; of disturbing the peace--a variety of offenses all rational\nto the year 1935.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Alten's case never reached even its hearing in the Magistrate's\nCourt. He arrived home just after dawn, that June 9, still cold and\nstiff from the effects of the ray, and bruised and battered by the\nsweeping blow of Miguel's great iron arm. He recalled vaguely seeing\nLarry fall, and the iron monster bearing Mary Atwood and me away. What\nhad happened to Larry, Alten could not guess, unless the Robot had\nreturned, ignored him and taken his friend away.\n\nDuring that day of June 9 Alten summoned several of his scientific\nfriends, and to them he told fully what had happened to him. They\nlistened with a keen understanding and a rational knowledge of the\npossibility that what he said was true; but credibility they could not\ngive him.\n\nThe noon papers came out.\n\n     NOTED ALIENIST ATTACKED BY GHOST Felled by One of the\n     Fantastic Monsters of His Brain\n\nA jocular, jibing account. Then Alten gave it up. He had about decided\nto plead guilty in the Magistrate's Court to disorderly conduct and\nall the rest of it! That was preferable to being judged a liar, or\ninsane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, at about 9 P.M. on the evening of June 9, the first of the\nmechanical monsters came stalking from the house on Patton Place--the\nbeginning of the revenge which Tugh had threatened when arrested. The\npoliceman at the corner--one McGuire--turned in the first hysterical\nalarm. He rushed into a little candy and stationery store shouting\nthat he had seen a piece of machinery running wild. His telephone call\nbrought a squad of his comrades. The Robot at first did no damage.\n\nMcGuire later told how he saw it as it emerged from the entryway of\nthe Tugh house. It came lurching out into the street--a giant thing of\ndull grey metal, with tubular, jointed legs; a body with a great\nbulging chest; a round head, eight or ten feet above the pavement;\neyes that shot fire.\n\nThe policeman took to his heels. There was a commotion in Patton Place\nduring those next few minutes. Pedestrians saw the thing standing in\nthe middle of the street, staring stupidly around it. The head\nwobbled. Some said that the eyes shot fire; others, that it was not\nthe eyes, but more like a torch in its mailed hand. The torch shot a\nsmall beam of light around the street--a beam which was dull-red.\n\nThe pedestrians fled. Their cries brought people to the nearby house\nwindows. Women screamed. Presently bottles were thrown from the\nwindows. One of these crashed against the iron shoulder of the\nmonster. It turned its head: as though its neck were rubber, some\nsaid. And it gazed upward, with a human gesture as though it were not\nangry, but contemptuous.\n\nBut still, beyond a step or two in one direction or another, it merely\nstood and waved its torch. The little dull-red beam of light carried\nno more than twenty or thirty feet. The street in a few moments was\nclear of pedestrians; remained littered with glass from the broken\nbottles. A taxi came suddenly around the corner, and the driver, with\nan almost immediate tire puncture, saw the monster. He hauled up to\nthe curb, left his cab and ran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Robot saw the taxicab, and stood gazing. It turned its torch-beam\non it, and seemed surprised that the thing did not move. Then thinking\nevidently that this was a less cowardly enemy than the humans, it made\na rush to it. The chauffeur had not turned off his engine when he\nfled, so the cab stood throbbing.\n\nThe Robot reached it; cuffed it with a huge mailed fist. The\nwindshield broke; the windows were shattered; but the cab stood\npurring, planted upon its four wheels.\n\nStrange encounter! They say that the Robot tried to talk to it. At\nlast, exasperated, it stepped backward, gathered itself and pounced on\nit again. Stooping, it put one of its great arms down under the\nwheels, the other over the hood, and with prodigious strength heaved\nthe cab into the air. It crashed on its side across the street, and in\na moment was covered with flames.\n\nIt was about this time that Patrolman McGuire came back to the scene.\nHe shot at the monster a few times; hit it, he was sure. But the Robot\ndid not heed him.\n\nThe block was now in chaos. People stood at most of the windows,\ncrowds gathered at the distant street corners, while the blazing\ntaxicab lighted the block with a lurid glare. No one dared approach\nwithin a hundred feet or so of the monster. But when, after a time, it\nshowed no disposition to attack, throngs at every distinct point of\nvantage tried to gather where they could see it. Those nearest\nreported back that its face was iron; that it had a nose, a wide,\nyawning mouth, and holes for eyes. There were certainly little lights\nin the eye-holes.\n\nA small, fluffy white dog went dashing up to the monster and barked\nbravely at its heels. It leaped nimbly away when the Robot stooped to\nseize it. Then, from the Robot's chest, the dull-red torch beam leaped\nout and down. It caught the little dog, and clung to it for an\ninstant. The dog stood transfixed; its bark turned to a yelp; then a\ngurgle. In a moment it fell on its side; then lay motionless with\nstiffened legs sticking out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this happened within five minutes. McGuire's riot squad arrived,\ndiscreetly ranged itself at the end of the block and fired. The Robot\nby then had retreated to the entryway of the Tugh house, where it\nstood peering as though with curiosity at all this commotion. There\ncame a clanging from the distance: someone had turned in a fire alarm.\nThrough the gathered crowds and vehicles the engines came tearing up.\n\nPresently there was not one Robot, but three: a dozen! More than that,\nmany reports said. But certain it is that within half an hour of the\nfirst alarm, the block in front of Tugh's home held many of the iron\nmonsters. And there were many human bodies lying strewn there, by\nthen. A few policemen had made a stand at the corner, to protect the\ncrowd against one of the Robots. The thing had made an unexpected\ninfuriated rush....\n\nThere was a panic in the next block, when a thousand people suddenly\ntried to run. A score of people were trampled under foot. Two or three\nof the Robots ran into that next block--ran impervious to the many\nshots which now were fired at them. From what was described as slots\nin the sides of their iron bodies they drew swords--long, dark,\nburnished blades. They ran, and at each fallen human body they made a\nsingle stroke of decapitation, or, more generally, cut the body in\nhalf.\n\nThe Robots did not attack the fire engines. Emboldened by this,\nfiremen connected a hose and pumped a huge jet of water toward the\nTugh house. The Robots then rushed it. One huge mechanism--some said\nit was twelve feet tall--ran heedlessly into the firemen's\nhigh-pressure stream, toppled backward from the force of the water and\nvery strangely lay still. Killed? Rather, out of order: deranged: it\nwas not human, to be killed. But it lay motionless, with the fire hose\nplaying upon it. Then abruptly there was an explosion. The fallen\nRobot, with a deafening report and a puff of green flame, burst into\nflying metallic fragments like shrapnel. Nearby windows were broken\nfrom the violent explosion, and pieces of the flying metal were hurled\na hundred feet or more. One huge chunk, evidently a plate of the\nthing's body, struck into the crowd two blocks away, and felled\nseveral people.\n\nAt this smashing of one of the mechanisms, its brother Robots went for\nthe first time into aggressive action. A hundred or more were pouring\nnow from the vacant house of the absent Tugh....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe alarm by ten o'clock had spread throughout the entire city. Police\nreserves were called out, and by midnight soldiers were being\nmobilized. Panics were starting everywhere. Millions of people crowded\nin on small Manhattan Island, in the heart of which was this strange\nenemy.\n\nPanics.... Yet human nature is very strange. Thousands of people\nstarted to leave Manhattan, but there were other thousands during that\nfirst skirmish who did their best to try and get to the neighborhood\nof Patton Place to see what was going on. They added greatly to the\nconfusion. Traffic soon was stalled everywhere. Traffic officers,\nconfused, frightened by the news which was bubbled at them from every\nside, gave wrong orders; accidents began to occur. And then, out of\nthe growing confusion, came tangles, until, like a dammed stream, all\nthe city mid-section was paralyzed. Vehicles were abandoned\neverywhere.\n\nReports of what was happening on Patton Place grew more confused. The\ngathering nearby crowds impeded the police and firemen. The Robots, by\nten o'clock, were using a single great beam of dull-red light. It was\ntwo or three feet broad. It came from a spluttering, hissing cylinder\nmounted on runners which the Robots dragged along the ground, and the\nbeam was like that of a great red searchlight. It swung the length of\nPatton Place in both directions. It hissed against the houses;\npenetrated the open windows which now were all deserted; swept the\nfront cornices of the roofs, where crowds of tenants and others were\ntrying to hide. The red beam drove back the ones near the edge, except\nthose who were stricken by its frigid blast and dropped like plummets\ninto the street, where the Robots with flashing blades pounced upon\nthem.\n\nFrigid was the blast of this giant light-beam. The street, wet from\nthe fire-hose, was soon frozen with ice--ice which increased under the\nblast of the beam, and melted in the warm air of the night when the\nray turned away.\n\nFrom every distant point in the city, awed crowds could see that great\nshaft when it occasionally shot upward, to stain the sky with blood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Alten by midnight was with the city officials, telling them what\nhe could of the origin of this calamity. They were a distracted group\nindeed! There were a thousand things to do, and frantically they were\ngiving orders, struggling to cope with conditions so suddenly\nunprecedented. A great city, millions of people, plunged into\nconditions unfathomable. And every moment growing worse. One calamity\nbringing another, in the city, with its myriad diverse activities so\ninterwoven. Around Alten the clattering, terrifying reports were\nsurging. He sat there nearly all that night; and near dawn, an\nofficial plane carried him in a flight over the city.\n\nThe panics, by midnight, were causing the most deaths. Thousands,\nhundreds of thousands, were trying to leave the island. The tube\ntrains, the subways, the elevateds were jammed. There were riots\nwithout number in them. Ferryboats and bridges were thronged to their\ncapacity. Downtown Manhattan, fortunately comparatively empty, gave\nspace to the crowds plunging down from the crowded foreign quarters\nbordering Greenwich Village. By dawn it was estimated that five\nthousand people had been trampled to death by the panics in various\nparts of the city, in the tubes beneath the rivers and on departing\ntrains.\n\nAnd another thousand or more had been killed by the Robots. How many\nof these monstrous metal men were now in evidence, no one could\nguess. A hundred--or a thousand. The Time-cage made many trips between\nthat night of June 9 and 10, 1935, and a night in 2930. Always it\ngauged its return to this same night.\n\nThe Robots poured out into Patton Place. With running, stiff-legged\nsteps, flashing swords, small light-beams darting before them, they\nspread about the city....\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe Vengeance of Tugh\n\nA myriad individual scenes of horror were enacted. Metal travesties of\nthe human form ran along the city streets, overturning stalled\nvehicles, climbing into houses, roaming dark hallways, breaking into\nrooms.\n\nThere was a woman who afterward told that she crouched in a corner,\nclutching her child, when the door of her room was burst in. Her\nhusband, who had kept them there thinking it was the safest thing to\ndo, fought futilely with the great thing of iron. Its sword slashed\nhis head from his body with a single stroke. The woman and the little\nchild screamed, but the monster ignored them. They had a radio, tuned\nto a station in New Jersey which was broadcasting the events. The\nRobot seized the instrument as though in a frenzy of anger, tore it\napart, then rushed from the room.\n\nNo one could give a connected picture of the events of that horrible\nnight. It was a series of disjointed incidents out of which the\nimagination must construct the whole.\n\nThe panics were everywhere. The streets were stalled with traffic and\nrunning, shouting, fighting people. And the area around Greenwich\nVillage brought reports of continued horror.\n\nThe Robots were of many different forms; some pseudo-human; others,\ngreat machines running amuck--things more monstrous, more horrible\neven, than those which mocked humanity. There was a great pot-bellied\nmonster which forced its way somehow to a roof. It encountered a\ncrouching woman and child in a corner of the parapet, seized them, one\nin each of its great iron hands, and whirled them out over the\nhousetops.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy dawn it seemed that the Robots had mounted several projectors of\nthe giant red beam on the roofs of Patton Place. They held a full\nsquare mile, now, around Tugh's house. The police and firemen had long\nsince given up fighting them. They were needed elsewhere--the police\nto try and cope with the panics, and the firemen to fight the\nconflagrations which everywhere began springing up. Fires, the natural\noutcome of chaos; and fires, incendiary--made by criminals who took\nadvantage of the disaster to fatten like ghouls upon the dead. They\nprowled the streets. They robbed and murdered at will.\n\nThe giant beams of the Robots carried a frigid blast for miles. By\ndawn of that June 10th, the south wind was carrying from the enemy\narea a perceptible wave of cold even as far as Westchester. Allen,\nflying over the city, saw the devastated area clearly. Ice in the\nstreets--smashed vehicles--the gruesome litter of sword-slashed human\nbodies. And other human bodies, plucked apart; strewn....\n\nAlten's plane flew at an altitude of some two thousand feet. In the\ngrowing daylight the dark prowling figures of the metal men were\nplainly seen. There were no humans left alive in the captured area.\nThe plane dropped a bomb into Washington Square where a dozen or two\nof the Robots were gathered. It missed them. The plane's pilot had not\nrealized that they were grouped around a projector; its red shaft\nsprang up, caught the plane and clung to it. Frigid blast! Even at\nthat two thousand feet altitude, for a few seconds Alten and the\nothers were stiffened by the cold. The motor missed; very nearly\nstopped. Then an intervening rooftop cut off the beam, and the plane\nescaped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this I have pictured from what Dr. Alten subsequently told me. He\nleaves my narrative now, since fate hereafter held him in the New York\nCity of 1935. But he has described for me three horrible days, and\nthree still more horrible nights. The whole world now was alarmed.\nEvery nation offered its forces of air and land and sea to overcome\nthese gruesome invaders. Warships steamed for New York harbor.\nSoldiers were entrained and brought to the city outskirts. Airplanes\nflew overhead. On Long Island, Staten Island, and in New Jersey,\ninfantry, tanks and artillery were massed in readiness.\n\nBut they were all very nearly powerless to attack. Manhattan Island\nstill was thronged with refugees. It was not possible for the millions\nto escape; and for the first day there were hundreds of thousands\nhiding in their homes. The city could not be shelled. The influx of\ntroops was hampered by the outrush of civilians.\n\nBy the night of the tenth, nevertheless, ten thousand soldiers were\nsurrounding the enemy area. It embraced now all the mid-section of the\nisland. The soldiers rushed in. Machine-guns were set up.\n\nBut the Robots were difficult to find. With this direct attack they\nbegan fighting with an almost human caution. Their bodies were\nimpervious to bullets, save perhaps in the orifices of the face which\nmight or might not be vulnerable. But when attacked, they skulked in\nthe houses, or crouched like cautious animals under the smashed\nvehicles. Then there were times when they would wade forward directly\ninto machine-gun fire--unharmed--plunging on until the gunners fled\nand the Robots wreaked their fury upon the abandoned gun.\n\nThe only hand-to-hand conflicts took place on the afternoon of June\n10th. A full thousand soldiers were killed--and possibly six or eight\nof the Robots. The troops were ordered away after that; they made\nlines across the island to the north and to the south, to keep the\nenemy from increasing its area. Over Greenwich Village now, the\ncircling planes--at their highest altitude, to avoid the upflung\ncrimson beams--dropped bombs. Hundreds of houses there were wrecked.\nTugh's house could not be positively identified, though the attack was\ndirected at it most particularly. Afterward, it was found by chance to\nhave escaped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe night of June 10th brought new horrors. The city lights failed.\nAgainst all the efforts of the troops and the artillery fire which now\nwas shelling the Washington Square area, the giant mechanisms pushed\nnorth and south. By midnight, with their dull-red beams illumining the\ndarkness of the canyon streets, they had reached the Battery, and\nspread northward beyond the northern limits of Central Park.\n\nIt is estimated that by then there were still a million people on\nManhattan Island.\n\nThe night of the 11th, the Robots made their real attack. Those who\nsaw it, from planes overhead, say that upon a roof near Washington\nSquare a machine was mounted from which a red beam sprang. It was not\nof parallel rays, like the others; this one spread. And of such power\nit was, that it painted the leaden clouds of the threatening, overcast\nnight. Every plane, at whatever high altitude, felt its frigid blast\nand winged hastily away to safety.\n\nSpreading, dull-red beam! It flashed with a range of miles. Its light\nseemed to cling to the clouds, staining like blood; and to cling to\nthe air itself with a dull lurid radiance.\n\nIt was a hot night, that June 11th, with a brewing thunderstorm. There\nhad been occasional rumbles of thunder and lightning flashes. The\ntemperature was perhaps 90\u00b0 F.\n\nThen the temperature began falling. A million people were hiding in\nthe great apartment houses and homes of the northern sections, or\nstill struggling to escape over the littered bridges or by the\nparalyzed transportation systems--and that million people saw the\ncrimson radiance and felt the falling temperature.\n\n80\u00b0. Then 70\u00b0. Within half an hour it was at 30\u00b0! In unheated houses,\nin midsummer, in the midst of panic, the people were swept by chilling\ncold. With no adequate clothing available they suffered greatly--and\nthen abruptly they were freezing. Children wailing with the cold; then\nasleep in numbed, last slumber....\n\nZero weather in midsummer! And below zero! How cold it got, there is\nno one to say. The abandoned recording instrument in the Weather\nBureau was found, at 2:16 A.M., the morning of June 12, 1935, to have\ntouched minus 42\u00b0 F.\n\nThe gathering storm over the city burst with lightning and thunder\nclaps through the blood-red radiance. And then snow began falling. A\nsteady white downpour, a winter blizzard with the lightning flashing\nabove it, and the thunder crashing.\n\nWith the lightning and thunder and snow, crazy winds sprang up. They\nwhirled and tossed the thick white snowflakes; swept in blasts along\nthe city streets. It piled the snow in great drifts against the\nhouses; whirled and sucked it upward in white powdery geysers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt 2:30 A.M. there came a change. The dull-red radiance which swept\nthe city changed in color. Through the shades of the spectrum it swung\nup to violet. And no longer was it a blast of cold, but of heat! Of\nwhat inherent temperature the ray of that spreading beam may have\nbeen, no one can say. It caught the houses, and everything inflammable\nburst into flame. Conflagrations were everywhere--a thousand spots of\nyellow-red flames, like torches, with smoke rolling up from them to\nmingle with the violet glow overhead.\n\nThe blizzard was gone. The snow ceased. The storm clouds rolled away,\nblasted by the pendulum winds which lashed the city.\n\nBy 3 A.M. the city temperature was over 100\u00b0 F--the dry, blistering\nheat of a midsummer desert. The northern city streets were littered\nwith the bodies of people who had rushed from their homes and fallen\nin the heat, the wild winds and the suffocating smoke outside.\n\nAnd then, flung back by the abnormal winds, the storm clouds crashed\ntogether overhead. A terrible storm, born of outraged nature, vent\nitself on the city. The fires of the burning metropolis presently died\nunder the torrent of falling water. Clouds of steam whirled and tossed\nand hissed close overhead, and there was a boiling hot rain.\n\nBy dawn the radiance of that strange spreading beam died away. The\ndaylight showed a wrecked, dead city. Few humans indeed were left\nalive on Manhattan that dawn. The Robots and their apparatus had\ngone....\n\nThe vengeance of Tugh against the New York City of 1935 was\naccomplished.\n\n(_To be continued._)\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement.]\n\n\n\n\nHell's Dimension\n\n_By Tom Curry_\n\n[Illustration: _Just as the terrific unknown force reached its apex, she stepped\nacross the plate._]\n\n[Sidenote: Professor Lambert deliberately ventures into a Vibrational\nDimension to join his fiancee in its magnetic torture-fields.]\n\n\n\"Now, Professor Lambert, tell us what you have done with the body of\nyour assistant Miss Madge Crawford. Her car is outside your door, has\nstood there since early yesterday morning. There are no footprints\nleading away from the house and you can't expect us to believe that an\nairplane picked her off the roof. It will make it a lot easier if you\ntell us where she is. Her parents are greatly worried about her. When\nthey telephoned, you refused to talk to them, would not allow them to\nspeak to Miss Crawford. They are alarmed as to her fate. While you are\nnot the sort of man who would injure a young woman, still, things look\nbad for you. You had better explain fully.\"\n\nJohn Lambert, a man of about thirty-six, tall, spare, with black hair\nwhich was slightly tinged with gray at the temples in spite of his\nyouth, turned large eyes which were filled with agony upon his\nquestioners.\n\nLambert was already internationally famous for his unique and\nastounding experiments in the realm of sound and rhythm. He had been\nendowed by one of the great electrical companies to do original work,\nand his laboratory, in which he lived, was situated in a large tract\nof isolated woodland some forty miles from New York City. It was\nnecessary for the success of his work that as few disturbing noises as\npossible be made in the neighborhood. Many of his experiments with\nsound and etheric waves required absolute quiet and freedom from\ninterrupting noises. The delicate nature of some of the machines he\nused would not tolerate so much as the footsteps of a man within a\nhundred yards, and a passing car would have disrupted them entirely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLambert was terribly nervous; he trembled under the gaze of the stern\ndetective, come with several colleagues from a neighboring town at the\ncall of Madge Crawford's frightened family. The girl, whose picture\nstood on a working table nearby, looked at them from the photograph as\na beautiful young woman of twenty-five, light of hair, with large eyes\nand a lovely face.\n\nDetective Phillips pointed dramatically to the likeness of the missing\ngirl. \"Can you,\" he said, \"look at her there, and deny you loved her?\nAnd if she did not love you in return, then we have a motive for what\nyou have done--jealousy. Come, tell us what you have done with her.\nOur men will find her, anyway; they are searching the cellar for her\nnow. You can't hope to keep her, alive, and if she is dead--\"\n\nLambert uttered a cry of despair, and put his face in his long\nfingers. \"She--she--don't say she's dead!\"\n\n\"Then you did love her!\" exclaimed Phillips triumphantly, and\nexchanged glances with his companions.\n\n\"Of course I love her. And she returned my love. We were secretly\nengaged, and were to be married when we had finished these extremely\nimportant experiments. It is infamous though, to accuse me of having\nkilled her; if I have done so, then it was no fault of mine.\"\n\n\"Then you did kill her?\"\n\n\"No, no. I cannot believe she is really gone.\"\n\n\"Why did you evade her parents' inquiries?\"\n\n\"Because ... I have been trying to bring her ... to re-materialize\nher.\"\n\n\"You mean to bring her back to life?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Couldn't a doctor do that better than you, if she is hidden somewhere\nabout here?\" asked Phillips gravely.\n\n\"No, no. You do not understand. She cannot be seen, she has\ndematerialized. Oh, go away. I'm the only man, save, possibly, my\nfriend Doctor Morgan, who can help her now. And Morgan--I've thought\nof calling him, but I've been working every instant to get the right\ncombination. Go away, for God's sake!\"\n\n\"We can't go away until we have found out Miss Crawford's fate,\" said\nPhillips patiently.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother sleuth entered the immense laboratory. He made his way through\nthe myriad strange machines, a weird collection of xylophones, gongs,\nstone slabs cut in peculiar patterns to produce odd rhythmic sounds,\nelectrical apparatus of all sorts. Near Phillips was a plate some feet\nsquare, of heavy metal, raised from the floor on poles of a different\nsubstance. About the ceiling were studs thickly set of the same sort\nof metal as was the big plate.\n\nOne of the sleuths tapped his forehead, pointing to Lambert as the\nlatter nervously lighted a cigarette.\n\nThe newcomer reported to Phillips. He held in his hand two or three\nsheets of paper on which something was written.\n\n\"The only other person here is a deaf mute,\" said the sleuth to\nPhillips, his superior. \"I've got his story. He writes that he takes\ncare of things, cooks their meals and so on. And he writes further\nthat he thinks the woman and this guy Lambert were in love with each\nother. He has no idea where she has gone to. Here, you read it.\"\n\nPhillips took the sheets and continued: \"'Yesterday morning about ten\no'clock I was passing the door of the laboratory on my way to make up\nProfessor Lambert's bed. Suddenly I noticed a queer, shimmering,\ngreenish-blue light streaming down from the walls and ceiling of the\nlaboratory. I was right outside the place and though I cannot hear\nanything, I was knocked down and I twisted and wriggled around like a\nsnake. It felt like something with a thousand little paws but with\ngreat strength was pushing me every way. When there was a lull, and\nthe light had stopped for a few moments, I staggered to my feet and\nran madly for my own quarters, scared out of my head. As I went by the\nkitchen, I saw Miss Crawford at the sink there, filling some vases and\narranging flowers as she usually did every morning.\n\n\"'If she called to me, I did not hear her or notice her lips moving. I\nbelieve she came to the door.\n\n\"'I was going to quit, when I recovered myself, angry at what had\noccurred; but then, I began to feel ashamed for being such a baby, for\nProfessor Lambert has been very good to me. About fifteen minutes\nafter I went to my room, I was able to return to the kitchen. Miss\nCrawford was not there, though the flowers and vases were. Then, as I\nstarted to work, still a little alarmed, Professor Lambert came\nrushing into the kitchen, an expression of terror on his face. His\nmouth was open, and I think he was calling. He then ran out, back to\nthe laboratory, and I have not seen Miss Madge since. Professor\nLambert has been almost continuously in the work-room since then,\nand--I kept away from it, because I was afraid.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo more members of Phillips' squad broke into the laboratory and came\ntoward the chief. They had been working at physical labor, for they\nwere still perspiring and one regarded his hands with a rueful\nexpression.\n\n\"Any luck?\" asked Phillips eagerly.\n\n\"No, boss. We been all over the place, and we dug every spot we could\nget to earth in the cellar. Most of it's three-inch concrete, without\na sign of a break.\"\n\n\"Did you look in the furnace?\"\n\n\"We looked there the first thing. She ain't there.\"\n\nThere were several closets in the laboratory, and Phillips opened all\nof them and inspected them. As he moved near the big plate, Lambert\nuttered a cry of warning. \"Don't disturb that, don't touch anything\nnear it!\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" said Phillips testily.\n\nThe skeptical sleuths had classified Lambert as a \"nut,\" and were\npractically sure he had done away with Madge Crawford because she\nwould not marry him.\n\nStill, they needed better evidence than their mere beliefs. There was\nno corpus delicti, for instance.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Lambert at last, controlling his emotions with a\ngreat effort. \"I will admit to you that I am in trepidation and a\nstate of mental torture as to Miss Crawford's fate. You are delaying\nmatters, keeping me from my work.\"\n\n\"He thinks about work when the girl he claims he loves has\ndisappeared,\" said Doherty, in a loud whisper to Phillips. Doherty was\none of the sleuths who had been digging in the cellar, and the hard\nwork had made his temper short.\n\n\"You must help us find Miss Crawford before we can let you alone,\"\nsaid Phillips. \"Can't you understand that you are under grave\nsuspicion of having injured her, hidden her away? This is a serious\nmatter, Professor Lambert. Your experiments can wait.\"\n\n\"This one cannot,\" shouted Lambert, shaking his fists. \"You are\nfools!\"\n\n\"Steady now,\" said Doherty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Perhaps you had better come with us to the district attorney's\noffice,\" went on Phillips. \"There you may come to your senses and\nrealize the futility of trying to cover up your crime--if you have\ncommitted one. If you have not, why do you not tell us where Miss\nCrawford is?\"\n\n\"Because I do not know myself,\" replied Lambert. \"But you can't take\nme away from here. I beg of you, gentlemen, allow me a little more\ntime. I must have it.\"\n\nPhillips shook his head. \"Not unless you tell us logically what has\noccurred,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I must, though I do not think you will comprehend or even\nbelieve me. Briefly, it is this: yesterday morning I was working on\nthe final series of experiments with a new type of harmonic overtones\nplus a new type of sinusoidal current which I had arranged with a\nseries of selenium cells. When I finally threw the switch--remember, I\nwas many weeks preparing the apparatus, and had just put the final\ntouches on early that morning--there was a sound such as never had\nbeen heard before by human ears, an indescribable sound, terrifying\nand mysterious. Also, there was a fierce, devouring verditer blue\nlight, and this came from the plates and studs you see, but so great\nwas its strength that it got out of control and leaped about the room\nlike a live thing. For some moments, while it increased in intensity\nas I raised the power of the current by means of the switch I held in\nmy hand, I watched and listened in fascination. My instruments had\nceased to record, though they are the most delicate ever invented and\ncan handle almost anything which man can even surmise.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe perspiration was pouring from Lambert's face, as he recounted his\nstory. The detectives listened, comprehending but a little of the\nmeaning of the scientist's words.\n\n\"What has this to do with Miss Crawford?\" asked Doherty impatiently.\n\nPhillips held up his hand to silence the other sleuth. \"Let him\nfinish,\" he ordered. \"Go on, professor.\"\n\n\"The sensations which I was undergoing became unendurable,\" went on\nLambert, in a low, hoarse voice. \"I was forced to cry out in pain and\nconfusion.\n\n\"Miss Crawford evidently heard my call, for a few moments later, just\nas the terrific unknown force reached its apex, she dashed into the\nlaboratory, and stepped across the plate you see there.\n\n\"I was powerless. Though I shut off the current by a superhuman\neffort, she--she was gone!\"\n\nLambert put his face in his hands, a sob shook his broad shoulders.\n\n\"Gone?\" repeated Phillips. \"What do you mean, gone?\"\n\n\"She disappeared, before my very eyes,\" said the professor shakily.\n\"Torn into nothingness by the fierce force of the current or sound.\nSince then, I have been trying to reproduce the conditions of the\nexperiment, for I wish to bring her back. If I cannot do so, then I\nwant to join her, wherever she has gone. I love her, I know now that I\ncannot possibly live without her. Will you please leave me alone, now,\nso that I can continue?\"\n\nDoherty laughed derisively. \"What a story,\" he jeered.\n\n\"Keep quiet, Doherty,\" ordered Phillips. \"Now, Professor Lambert, your\nexplanation of Miss Crawford's disappearance does not sound logical to\nus, but still we are willing to give you every chance to bring her\nback, if what you say is true. We cannot leave you entirely alone,\nbecause you might try to escape or you might carry out your threat of\nsuicide. Therefore, I am going to sit over there in the corner,\nquietly, where I can watch you but will not interfere with your work.\nWe will give you until midnight to prove your story. Then you must go\nwith us to the district attorney. Do you agree to that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLambert nodded, eagerly. \"I agree. Let me work in peace, and if I do\nnot succeed then you may take me anywhere you wish. If you can,\" he\nadded, in an undertone.\n\nDoherty and the others, at Phillips' orders, filed from the\nlaboratory. \"One thing more, professor,\" said Phillips, when they were\nalone and the professor was preparing to work. \"How do you explain the\nfact, if your story is true, that Miss Crawford was killed and made to\ndisappear, while you yourself, close by, were uninjured?\"\n\n\"Do you see these garments?\" asked Lambert, indicating some black\nclothes which lay on a bench nearby. \"They insulated me from the\ncurrent and partially protected me from the sound. Though the force\nwas very great, great enough to penetrate my insulation, it was\nhandicapped in my case because of the garments.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, you may go on.\"\n\nPhillips moved in the chair he had taken, from time to time. He could\nhear the noises of his men, still searching the premises for Madge\nCrawford, and Professor Lambert heard them, too.\n\n\"Will you tell your men to be quiet?\" he cried at last.\n\nThere were dark circles under Lambert's eyes. He was working in a\nstate of feverish anxiety. When the girl he loved had dematerialized\nfrom under his very eyes, panic had seized him; he had ripped away\nwires to break the current and lost the thread of his experiment, so\nthat he could not reproduce it exactly without much labor.\n\nThe scientist put on the black robes, and Phillips wished he too had\nsome protective armor, even though he did believe that Lambert had\ntold them a parcel of lies. The deaf mute's story was not too\nreassuring. Phillips warned his companions to be more quiet, and he\nhimself sat quite still.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLambert knew that the sleuths thought he was stark mad. He was aware\nof the fact that he had but a few hours in which to save the girl who\nhad come at his cry to help him, who had loved him and whom he loved,\nonly to be torn into some place unknown by the forces which were\nreleased in his experiment. And he knew he would rather die with her\nthan live without her.\n\nHe labored feverishly, though he tried to keep his brain calm in order\nto win. His notes helped him up to a certain point, but when he had\nmade the final touches he had not had time to bring the data up to the\nmoment, being eager to test out his apparatus. It was while testing\nthat the awful event had occurred and he had seen Madge Crawford\ndisappear before his very eyes.\n\nHer eyes, large and frightened, burned in his mind.\n\nThe deaf mute, Felix, a small, spare man of about fifty, sent the\nprofessor some food and coffee through one of the sleuths. Lambert\nswallowed the coffee, but waved away the rest, impatiently. Phillips,\nwatching his suspect constantly, was served a light supper at the end\nof the afternoon.\n\nThere seemed to be a million wires to be touched, tested, and various\nstrange apparatus. Several times, later on in the evening. Lambert\nthrew the big switch with an air of expectancy, but little happened.\nThen Lambert would go to work again, testing, testing--adjusting this\nand that till Phillips swore under his breath.\n\n\"Only an hour more, professor,\" said Phillips, who was bored to death\nand cramped from trying to obey the professor's orders to keep still.\nA circle of cigarette-ends surrounded the sleuth.\n\n\"Only an hour,\" agreed Lambert. \"Will you please be quiet, my man?\nThis is a matter of my fianc\u00e9e's life or death.\"\n\nPhillips was somewhat disgruntled, for he felt he had done Lambert\nquite a favor in allowing him to remain in the laboratory for so long,\nto prove his story.\n\n\"I wish Doctor Morgan were here; I ought to have sent for him, I\nsuppose,\" said Lambert, a few minutes later. \"Will you allow me to get\nhim? I cannot seem to perfect this last stage.\"\n\n\"No time, now,\" declared Phillips. \"I said till midnight.\"\n\nIt was obvious to Lambert that the detective had become certain during\nthe course of the evening that the scientist was mad. The ceaseless\nfiddling and the lack of results or even spectacular sights had\nconvinced Phillips that he had to do with a crank.\n\n\"I think I have it now,\" said Lambert coolly.\n\n\"What?\" asked Phillips.\n\n\"The original combination. I had forgotten one detail in the\nexcitement, and this threw me off. Now I believe I will succeed--in\none way or another. I warn you, be careful. I am about to release\nforces which may get out of my control.\"\n\n\"Well, now, don't get reckless,\" begged Phillips nervously. The array\nof machines had impressed him, even if Lambert did seem a fool.\n\n\"You insist upon remaining, so it is your own risk,\" said Lambert\ncoolly.\n\nLambert, in the strange robes, was a bizarre figure. The hood was\nthrown back, exposing his pale, black-bearded face, the wan eyes with\ndark circles under them, and the twitching lips.\n\n\"If you find yourself leaving this vale of tears,\" went on the\nscientist, ironically, to the sleuth, \"you will at least have the\ncomfort of realizing that as the sound-force disintegrates your mortal\nform you are among the first of men to be attuned to the vibrations of\nthe unknown sound world. All matter is vibration; that has been\nproven. A building of bricks, if shaken in the right manner, falls\ninto its component parts; a bridge, crossed by soldiers in certain\nrhythmic time, is torn from its moorings. A tuning fork, receiving the\nsound vibrations from one of a similar size and shape begins to\nvibrate in turn. These are homely analogies, but applied to the less\nfamiliar sound vibrations, which make up our atomic world, they may\nhelp you to understand how the terrific forces I have discovered can\ndisintegrate flesh.\"\n\nThe scientist looked inquiringly at Phillips. As the sleuth did not\nmove, but sat with folded arms, Lambert shrugged and said, \"I am\nready.\"\n\nLambert raised his hood, and Phillips said, in a spirit of bravado,\n\"You can't scare me out of here.\"\n\n\"Here goes the switch,\" cried Lambert.\n\nHe made the contact, as he had before. He stood for a moment, and this\ntime the current gained force. The experimenter pushed his lever all\nthe way over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA terrible greenish-blue light suddenly illuminated the laboratory,\nand through the air there came sound vibrations which seemed to tear\nat Phillips' body. He found himself on the floor, knocked from his\nchair, and he writhed this way and that, speechless, suffering a\ntorment of agony. His whole flesh seemed to tremble in unison with the\nwaves which emanated from the machines which Lambert manipulated.\n\nAfter what seemed hours to the suffering sleuth, the force diminished,\nand soon Phillips was able to rise. Trembling, the detective cursed\nand yelled for help in a high-pitched voice.\n\nLambert had thrown back his hood, and was rocking to and fro in agony.\n\n\"Madge, Madge,\" he cried, \"what have I done! Come back to me, come\nback!\"\n\nDoherty and the others came running in at their chief's shouts.\n\"Arrest him,\" ordered Phillips shakily. \"I've stood enough of this\nnonsense.\"\n\nThe detectives started for Lambert. He saw them coming, and swiftly\nthrew off the protective garments he wore.\n\n\"Stand back!\" he cried, and threw the switch all the way over. The\nverditer green light smashed through the air, and the queer sound\nsensations smacked and tore them; Doherty, who had drawn a revolver\nwhen he was answering Phillips' cries, fired the gun into the air, and\nthe report seemed to battle with the vibrating ether.\n\nLambert, as he threw the switch, leaped forward and landed on the\nmetal plate under the ceiling studs, in the very center of the awful\ndisturbance and unprotected from its force.\n\nFor a few moments, Lambert felt racking pain, as though something were\ntearing at his flesh, separating the very atoms. The scientist saw the\nwriggling figures of the sleuths, in various strange positions, but his\nimpressions were confused. His head whirled round and round, he swayed\nto and fro, and, finally, he thought he fell down, or rather, that he\nhad melted, as a lump of sugar dissolves in water.\n\n\"He's gone--gone--\"\n\nIn the heart of nothingness was Lambert, his body torn and racked in a\nshrieking chaos of sound and a blinding glare of iridescent light\nwhich seemed too much to bear.\n\nHis last conscious thought was a prayer, that, having failed to bring\nback his sweetheart, Madge Crawford, he was undergoing a step toward\nthe same destination to which he had sent her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohn Lambert came to with a shudder. But it was not a mortal shudder.\nHe could sense no body; had no sense of being confined by matter. He\nwas in a strange, chilly place--a twilight region, limitless, without\ndimensions.\n\nYet he could feel something, in an impersonal way, vaguely\nindifferent. He had no pain now.\n\nHe was moving, somehow. He had one impelling desire, and that was to\ndiscover Madge Crawford. Perhaps it was this thought which directed\nhis movements.\n\nIntent upon finding the girl, if she was indeed in this same strange\nworld that he was, he did not notice for some time--how long, he had\nno way of telling--that there were other beings which tried to impede\nhis progress. But as he grew more accustomed to the unfamiliar\nsensations he was undergoing, he found his path blocked again and\nagain by queer beings.\n\nThey were living, without doubt, and had intelligence, and evinced\nhostility toward him. But they were shapeless, shapeless as amoebas.\nHe heard them in a sort of soundless whisper, and could see them\nwithout the use of eyes. And he shuddered, though he could feel no\nbody in which he might be confined. Still, when he pinched viciously\nwith invisible fingers at the spot where his face should have been, a\ntwinge of pain registered on the vague consciousness which appeared to\nbe all there was to him.\n\nHe was not sure of his substance, though he could evidently experience\nhuman sensations with his amorphous body. He did not know whether he\ncould see; yet, he was dodging this way and that, as the beings who\noccupied this world tried to stop him.\n\nThey gave him the impression of gray shapes, and in coppery shadows\nthings gleamed and closed in on him.\n\nHe seemed to hear a cry, and he knew that he was receiving a call for\nhelp from Madge Crawford. He tried to run, pushed determinedly toward\nthe spot, impelled by his love for the girl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, as he hurried, he occasionally was stopped short by collision\nwith the formless shapes which were all about him. He was hampered by\nthem, for they followed him, making a sound like wind heard in a\ndream. Whatever medium he was in was evidently thickly inhabited by\nthe hostile beings who claimed this world as their own. Though he\ncould not actually feel the medium, he could sense that it was heavy.\nHe leaped and ran, fighting his way through the increasing hosts, and\nthe roar of their voice-impressions increased in his consciousness.\n\nYet there seemed to be nothing, nothing tangible save vagueness. He\nfelt he was in a blind spot in space, a place of no dimensions, no\ntime, where beings abhorred by nature, things which had never\ndeveloped any dimensional laws, existed.\n\nThe cry for help struck him, with more force this time. Lambert,\nwhatever form he was in, realised that he was close to the end of his\njourney to Madge Crawford.\n\nHe tried to speak, and had the impression that he said something\nreassuring. He then bumped into some vibrational being which he knew\nwas Madge. His ears could not hear, nor could his flesh feel, but his\nwhole form or cerebrum sensed he held the woman he loved in his arms.\n\nAnd she was speaking to him, in accents of fear, begging him to save\nher.\n\n\"John, John, you have come at last. They have been torturing me\nterribly. Save me.\"\n\n\"Darling Madge, I will do everything I can. Now I have found you, and\nwe are together and will never part. Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"I know what you are thinking, and what you wish to say. I can't\nexactly hear; it all seems vague, and impossible. Yet I can suffer.\nThey have been hitting me with something which makes me shudder and\nshake--there, they are at it again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLambert felt the sensations, now, which the girl had made known to\nhim. He felt crowded by gray beings, and his existence was troubled by\nspasms of pain-impressions. He knew Madge was crying out, too.\n\nHe could not comprehend the attacks, or guess their meaning. But the\nsituation was unendurable.\n\nAnger shook him, and he began to fight, furiously but vaguely. They\nwere closely hemmed in, but when Lambert began to strike out with\nhands and legs, the beings gave way a little. The scientist tried to\nshout, and though he could actually hear nothing, the result was\ngratifying. The formless creatures seemed to scatter and draw back in\nconfusion as he yelled his defiance.\n\n\"They hate that,\" Madge said to him. \"I have screamed myself hoarse\nand that is why they have not killed me--if I can be killed.\"\n\n\"I do not believe we can. But they can torture us,\" replied Lambert.\n\"It is an everlasting half-life or quarter-life, and these creatures\nwho call this Hell's Dimension home, have nothing but hatred for us in\ntheir consciousness.\"\n\nThe inhabitants of the imperfect world had closed in once again and\nthe sharp instruments of torture they used were being thrust into the\ninvisible bodies of the two humans. Each time, Lambert was unable to\nrestrain his cries, for it seemed that he was being torn to pieces by\nvibrations.\n\nHe yelled until he could not speak above a whisper, or at least until\nthe impressions of speech he gave forth did not trouble the beings.\nThe two humans, still bound to some extent by their mortal beliefs,\nwere chivvied to and fro, and struck and bullied. The creatures seemed\nto delight in this sport.\n\nThe two felt they could not die; yet they could suffer terribly. Would\nthis go on through eternity? Was there no release?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were trying to tear Madge away from him. She was fighting them,\nand Lambert, in a frenzy of rage, made a determined effort to get away\nwith the girl from their tormentors.\n\nThey retreated before his onslaughts. Drawing Madge after him, Lambert\nput down his head--or believed he was doing so--and ran as fast as he\ncould at the beings.\n\nHe bumped into some invisible forms and was slowed in his rush, but he\nshouted and flailed about with his arms, and tried to kick. Madge\nhelped by screaming and striking out. They made some distance in this\nway, or so they thought, and the horrid creatures gave way before\nthem.\n\nAll about them was the coppery sensation of the medium in which they\nmoved: Lambert as he became more used to the form he was inhabiting,\nhe began to think he could discern dreadful eyes which stared\nunblinkingly at the couple.\n\nHe fought on, and believed they had come to a spot where the beings\ndid not molest them, though they still sensed the things glaring at\nthem.\n\nWere they on some invisible eminence, above the reach of these queer\ncreatures?\n\n\"We might as well stop here, for if we try to go farther we may come\nto a worse place,\" said Lambert.\n\nThey rested there, in temporary peace, together at last.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I seem to be happy now,\" said Madge, clinging close. \"I feared I\nwould never see you again. John dear. I ran to you when you called out\nthat day and when I crossed the plate, I was torn and racked and\nknocked down. When I next experienced sensation, it was in this\nterrible form. I am becoming more used to it, but I kept crying out\nfor you: the beings, as soon as they discovered my presence, began to\ntorment me. More and more have been collecting, and I have a sensation\nof seeing them as horrible, revolting beasts. Oh, John, I don't think\nI could have stood it much longer, if you hadn't come to me. They were\ndriving me on, on, on, ceaselessly torturing me.\"\n\n\"Curse them,\" said Lambert. \"I wish I could really get hold of some of\nthem. Perhaps, Madge, I will be able to think of some escape for us\nfrom this Hell's Dimension.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling. I could not bear to think that we are eternally damned\nto exist among these beings, hurt by them and unable to get away. How\nI wish we were back in the laboratory, at the tea table. How happy we\nwere there!\"\n\n\"And we will be again, Madge.\" Lambert was far from feeling hopeful,\nbut he tried to encourage the girl into thinking they might get away.\n\nHowever, he was unable to dissimulate. She felt his anguish for her\nsafety. \"But I know now that you love me. I can feel it stronger than\never before, John. It seems like a great rock to which I can always\ncling, your love. It projects me from the hatred that these beasts\npour out against us.\"\n\nSince they had no sense of time, they could not tell how long they\nwere allowed to remain unmolested. But in each other's company they\nwere happy, though each one was afraid for the safety of the loved\none.\n\nThey spoke of the mortal life they had lived, and their love. They\nfelt no need of food or water, but clung together in a dimensionless\nuniverse, held up by love.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lull came to an end, at last. There was no change in the coppery\nvagueness about them which they sensed as the surrounding ether, but\nall was changeless, boundless. Lambert, close to Madge Crawford, felt\nthat they were about to be attacked.\n\nHe had swift, temporary impressions of seeing saucerlike, unblinking\neyes, and then hordes of bizarre inhabitants started to climb up to\ntheir perch.\n\nFor a short while, Lambert and Madge fought them off, thrusting at\nthem, seeming to push them backward down the intangible slope; the\ncries which the dematerialized humans uttered also helped to hold the\nleaders of the attacking army partially in check, but the vast number\nof beings swept forward.\n\nThe thrusts of the torture-fields they emanated became more and more\nracking, as the two unfortunates shuddered in horror and pain.\n\nThe power to demonstrate loud noise was evidently impossible to the\ncreatures, for their only sounds came to Madge Crawford and John\nLambert as long-drawn out, almost unbearable squeaks, mouse-like in\ncharacter. Perhaps they had never had the faculty of speech, since\nthey did not need it to communicate with one another; perhaps they\nrealized that the racket they could make would hurt them as much as it\ndid their enemies.\n\nLambert, Madge clinging to him, was forced backward down the slope,\nand the beings had the advantage of height. He could not again reach\nthe eminence, but the way behind seemed to clear quickly enough,\nthough thrusts were made at him, innumerable times with the\ntorture-fields.\n\nThe hordes pushed them backward, and ever back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were forced on for some distance. As they retreated, the way\nbecome easier, and fewer and fewer of the beings impeded the channel\nalong which they moved, though in front of them and on all sides,\nabove, beneath, they were pressed by the hordes.\n\n\"They are forcing us to some place they want us to go,\" said Lambert\ndesperately.\n\n\"We can do nothing more,\" replied the girl.\n\nLambert felt her quiet confidence in him, and that as long as they\nwere together, all was well.\n\n\"Maybe they can kill us, somehow,\" he said.\n\nAnd now, Lambert felt the way was clear to the rear. There was a\nsudden rush of the creatures, and needlelike fields were impelled\nviciously into the spaces the two humans occupied.\n\nMadge cried out in pain, and Lambert shouted. The throng drew away\nfrom them as suddenly as it had surged forward, and an instant later\nthe pair, clinging together, felt that they were falling, falling,\nfalling....\n\n\"Are you all right, Madge?\"\n\n\"Yes, John.\"\n\nBut he knew she was suffering. How long they fell he did not know, but\nthey stopped at last. No sooner had they come to rest than they were\nassailed with sensations of pain which made both cry out in anguish.\n\nThere, in the spot where they had been thrust by the hordes, they felt\nthat there was some terrific vibration which racked and tore at their\ninvisible forms continuously, sending them into spasms of sharp\nmisery.\n\nThey both were forced to give vent to their feelings by loud cries.\nBut they could not command their movements any longer. When they tried\nto get away, their limbs moved but they felt that they remained in the\nsame spot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pain shook every fraction of their souls.\n\n\"We--we are in some pit of hell, into which they have thrown us,\nJohn,\" gasped Madge.\n\nHe knew she was shivering with the torture of that great vibration\nfrom which there was no escape, that they were in a prison-pit of\nHell's Dimension.\n\n\"I--oh--John--I'm dying!\"\n\nBut he was powerless to help her. He suffered as much as she. Yet\nthere was no weakening of his sensations; he was in as much torture as\nhe had been at the start. He knew that they could not die and could\nnever escape from this misery of hell.\n\nTheir cries seemed to disturb the vacuum about. Lambert, shivering and\nshaking with pain, was aware that great eyes, similar to those which\nthey had thought they saw above, were now upon them. Squeaks were\nimpressed upon him, squeaks which expressed disapprobation. There were\nsome of the beings in the pit with them.\n\nMadge knew they were there, too. She cried out in terror, \"Will they\nadd to our misery?\"\n\nBut the creatures in the vacuum were pinned to the spots they\noccupied, as were Madge and Lambert. From their squeaks it was evident\nthey suffered, too, and were fellow prisoners of the mortals.\n\n\"Probably the cries we make disturb them,\" said Lambert. \"Vibrations\nto which we and they are not attuned are torture to the form we are\nin. Evidently the inhabitants of this hell world punish offenders by\ncondemning them to this eternal torture.\"\n\n\"Why--why did they treat us so?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we jarred upon them, hurt them, because we were not of their\nkind exactly,\" said Lambert. \"Perhaps it was just their natural hatred\nof us as strangers.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey did not grow used to the terrible eternity of torments. No, if\nanything, it grew worse as it went on. Still, they could visualize no\nend to the existence to which they were bound. Throbs of awful\nintensity rent them, tore them apart myriad times, yet they still felt\nas keenly as before and suffered just as much. There was no death for\nthem, no release from the intangible world in which they were.\n\nTheir fellow prisoners squeaked at them, as though imploring them not\nto add to the agony by uttering discordant cries. But it was\nimpossible for Madge to keep quiet, and Lambert shouted in anguish\nfrom time to time.\n\nThere seemed to be no end to it.\n\nAnd yet, after what was eternity to the sufferers, Madge spoke\nhopefully.\n\n\"Darling John, I--I fear I am really going to die. I am growing\nweaker. I can feel the pain very little now. It is all vague, and is\ngetting less real to me. Good-by, sweetheart, I love you, and I always\nwill--\"\n\nLambert uttered a strangled cry, \"No, no. Don't leave me, Madge.\"\n\nHe clung to her, yet she was becoming extremely intangible to him. She\nwas melting away from his embrace, and Lambert felt that he, too, was\nweaker, even less real than he had been. He hoped that if it was the\nend, they would go together.\n\nDesperately, he tried to hold her with him, but he had little ability\nto do so. The torture was still racking his consciousness, but was\nbecoming more dreamlike.\n\nThere was a terrific snap, suddenly, and Lambert lost all\nconsciousness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Water, water!\"\n\nLambert, opening his eyes, felt his body writhing about, and\nexperienced pain that was--mortal. A bluish-green light dazzled his\npupils and made him blink.\n\nSomething cut into his flesh, and Lambert rolled about, trying to\nescape. He bumped into something, something soft; he clung to this\nform, and knew that he was holding on to a human being. Then the light\ndied out, and in its stead was the yellow, normal glow of the electric\nlights. Weak, famished, almost dead of thirst, Lambert looked about\nhim at the familiar sights of his laboratory. He was lying on the\nfloor, close by the metal plate, and at his side, unconscious but\nstill alive to judge by her rising and falling breast, was Madge\nCrawford.\n\nSomeone bent over him, and pressed a glass of water against his lips.\nHe drank, watching while a mortal whom Lambert at last realized was\nDetective Phillips bathed Madge Crawford's temples with water from a\npitcher and forced a little between her pale, drawn lips.\n\nLambert tried to rise, but he was weak, and required assistance. He\nwas dazed, still, and they sat him down in a chair and allowed him to\ncome to.\n\nHe shuddered from time to time, for he still thought he could feel the\ntorture which he had been undergoing. But he was worried about Madge,\nand watched anxiously as Phillips, assisted by another man, worked\nover the girl.\n\nAt last, Madge stirred and moaned faintly. They lifted her to a bench,\nwhere they gently restored her to full consciousness.\n\nWhen she could sit up, she at once cried out for Lambert.\n\nThe scientist had recovered enough to rise to his feet and stagger\ntoward her. \"Here I am, darling,\" he said.\n\n\"John--we're alive--we're back in the laboratory!\"\n\n\"Ah, Lambert. Glad to see you.\" A heavy voice spoke, and Lambert for\nthe first time noticed the black-clad figure which stood to one side,\nnear the switchboard, hidden by a large piece of apparatus.\n\n\"Dr. Morgan!\" cried Lambert.\n\nAlthaus Morgan, the renowned physicist, came forward calmly, with\noutstretched hand. \"So, you realized your great ambition, eh?\" he said\ncuriously. \"But where would you be if I had not been able to bring you\nback?\"\n\n\"In Hell--or Hell's Dimension, anyway,\" said Lambert.\n\nHe went to Madge, took her in his arms. \"Darling, we are safe. Morgan\nhas managed to re-materialize us. We will never again be cast into the\nvoid in this way. I shall destroy the apparatus and my notes.\"\n\nDoherty, who had been out of the room on some errand, came into the\nlaboratory. He shouted when he saw Lambert standing before him.\n\n\"So you got him,\" he cried. \"Where was he hidin'?\"\n\nHis eyes fell upon Madge Crawford, then, and he exclaimed in\nsatisfaction. \"You found her, eh?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Phillips. \"They came back. They suddenly appeared out of\nnothing, Doherty.\"\n\n\"Don't kid me,\" growled Doherty. \"They were hidin' in a closet\nsomewhere. Maybe they can fool you guys, but not me.\"\n\nLambert spoke to Phillips. \"I'm starving to death and I think Miss\nCrawford must be, too. Will you tell Felix to bring us some food,\nplenty of it?\"\n\nOne of the sleuths went to the kitchen to give the order. Lambert\nturned to Morgan.\n\n\"How did you manage to bring us back?\" he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorgan shrugged. \"It was all guess work at the last. I at first could\ncheck the apparatus by your notes, and this took some time. You know\nyou have written me in detail about what you were working on, so when\nI was summoned by Detective Phillips, who said you had mentioned my\nname to him as the only one who could help, I could make a good\nconjecture as to what had occurred. I heard the stories of all\nconcerned, and realized that you must have dematerialized Miss\nCrawford by mistake, and then, unable to bring her back, had followed\nher yourself.\n\n\"I put on your insulation outfit, and went to work. I have not left\nhere for a moment, but have snatched an hour or two of sleep from time\nto time. Detective Phillips has been very good and helpful.\n\n\"Finally, I had everything in shape, but I reversed the apparatus in\nvital spots, and tried each combination until suddenly, a few minutes\nago, you were re-materialized. It was a desperate chance, but I was\nforced to take it in an endeavor to save you.\"\n\nLambert held out his hand to his friend. \"I can never thank you\nenough,\" he said gratefully. \"You saved us from a horrible fate. But\nyou speak as though we had been gone a long while. Was it many hours?\"\n\n\"Hours?\" repeated Morgan, his lips parting under his black beard.\n\"Man, it was eight days! You have been gone since a week ago last\nnight!\"\n\nLambert turned to Phillips. \"I must ask you not to release this story\nto the newspapers,\" he begged.\n\nPhillips smiled and turned up his hands in a gesture of frank wonder.\n\"Professor Lambert,\" he said, \"I can't believe what I have seen\nmyself. If I told such a yarn to the reporters, they'd never forget\nit. They'd kid me out of the department.\"\n\n\"Aw, they were hidin' in a closet,\" growled Doherty. \"Come on, we've\nwasted too much time on this job already. Just a couple of nuts, says\nI.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sleuths, after Phillips had shaken hands with Lambert, left the\nlaboratory. Morgan, a large man of middle age, joined them in a meal\nwhich Felix served to the three on a folding table brought in for the\npurpose. Felix was terribly glad to see Madge and Lambert again, and\nmanifested his joy by many bobs and leaps as he waited upon them. A\ngrin spread across his face from ear to ear.\n\nMorgan asked innumerable questions. They described as best they could\nwhat they could recall of the strange dominion in which they had been,\nand the physicist listened intently.\n\n\"It is some Hell's Dimension, as you call it,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Where it is, or exactly what, I cannot say,\" said Lambert. \"I surely\nhave no desire to return to that world of hate.\"\n\nMadge, happy now, smiled at him and he leaned over and kissed her\ntenderly.\n\n\"We have come from Hell, together,\" said Lambert, \"and now we are in\nHeaven!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement]\n\n\n\n\nThe World Behind the Moon\n\n_By Paul Ernst_\n\n[Illustration: _They fell, for hours, into a deep chasm._]\n\n[Sidenote: Two intrepid Earth-men fight it out with the horrific\nmonsters of Zeud's frightful jungles.]\n\n\nLike pitiless jaws, a distant crater opened for their ship.\nHelplessly, they hurtled toward it: helplessly, because they were\nstill in the nothingness of space, with no atmospheric resistance on\nwhich their rudders, or stern or bow tubes, could get a purchase to\nsteer them.\n\nProfessor Dorn Wichter waited anxiously for the slight vibration that\nshould announce that the projectile-shaped shell had entered the new\nplanet's atmosphere.\n\n\"Have we struck it yet?\" asked Joyce, a tall blond young man with the\nshoulders of an athlete and the broad brow and square chin of one who\ncombines dreams with action. He made his way painfully toward\nWichter. It was the first time he had attempted to move since the\nshell had passed the neutral point--that belt midway between the moon\nand the world behind it, where the pull of gravity of each satellite\nwas neutralized by the other. They, and all the loose objects in the\nshell, had floated uncomfortably about the middle of the chamber for\nhalf an hour or so, gradually settling down again; until now it was\npossible, with care, to walk.\n\n\"Have we struck it?\" he repeated, leaning over the professor's\nshoulder and staring at the resistance gauge.\n\n\"No.\" Absently Wichter took off his spectacles and polished them.\n\"There's not a trace of resistance yet.\"\n\nThey gazed out the bow window toward the vast disc, like a serrated,\npock-marked plate of blue ice, that was the planet Zeud--discovered\nand named by them. The same thought was in the mind of each. Suppose\nthere were no atmosphere surrounding Zeud to cushion their descent\ninto the hundred-mile crater that yawned to receive them?\n\n\"Well,\" said Joyce after a time, \"we're taking no more of a chance\nhere than we did when we pointed our nose toward the moon. We were\nalmost sure that was no atmosphere there--which meant we'd nose dive\ninto the rocks at five thousand miles an hour. On Zeud there might be\nanything.\" His eyes shone. \"How wonderful that there should be such a\nplanet, unsuspected during all the centuries men have been studying\nthe heavens!\"\n\nWichter nodded agreement. It was indeed wonderful. But what was more\nwonderful was its present discovery: for that would never have\ntranspired had not he and Joyce succeeded in their attempt to fly to\nthe moon. From there, after following the sun in its slow journey\naround to the lost side of the lunar globe--that face which the earth\nhas never yet observed--they had seen shining in the near distance\nthe great ball which they had christened Zeud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAstronomical calculations had soon described the mysterious hidden\nsatellite. It was almost a twin to the moon; a very little smaller,\nand less than eighty thousand miles away. Its rotation was nearly\nsimilar, which made its days not quite sixteen of our earthly days. It\nwas of approximately the weight, per cubic mile, of Earth. And there\nit whirled, directly in a line with the earth and the moon, moving as\nthe moon moved so that it was ever out of sight beyond it, as a dime\nwould be out of sight if placed in a direct line behind a penny.\n\nZeud, the new satellite, the world beyond the moon! In their\nexcitement at its discovery, Joyce and Wichter had left the\nmoon--which they had found to be as dead and cold as it had been\nsurmised to be--and returned summarily to Earth. They had replenished\ntheir supplies and their oxygen tanks, and had come back--to circle\naround the moon and point the sharp prow of the shell toward Zeud. The\ngift of the moon to Earth was a dubious one; but the gift of a\npossibly living planet-colony to mankind might be the solution of the\novercrowded conditions of the terrestial sphere!\n\n\"Speed, three thousand miles an hour,\" computed Wichter. \"Distance to\nZeud, nine hundred and eighty miles. If we don't strike a few atoms of\nhydrogen or something soon we're going to drill this nearest crater a\nlittle deeper!\"\n\nJoyce nodded grimly. At two thousand miles from Earth there had still\nbeen enough hydrogen traces in the ether to give purchase to the\nexplosions of their water-motor. At six hundred miles from the moon\nthey had run into a sparse gaseous belt that had enabled them to\nchange direction and slow their speed. They had hoped to find hydrogen\nat a thousand or twelve hundred miles from Zeud.\n\n\"Eight hundred and thirty miles,\" commented Wichter, his slender,\nbent body tensed. \"Eight hundred miles--ah!\"\n\nA thrumming sound came to their ears as the shell quivered,\nimperceptibly almost, but unmistakeably, at the touch of some faint\nresistance outside in space.\n\n\"We've struck it, Joyce. And it's much denser than the moon's, even as\nwe'd hoped. There'll be life on Zeud, my boy, unless I'm vastly\nmistaken. You'd better look to the motor now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoyce went to the water-motor. This was a curious, but extremely\nsimple affair. There was a glass box, ribbed with polished steel,\nabout the size and shape of a cigar box, which was full of water.\nLeading away from this, to the bow and stern of the shell, were two\nsmall pipes. The pipes were greatly thickened for a period of three\nfeet or so, directly under the little tank, and were braced by\nbed-plates so heavy as to look all out of proportion. Around the\nthickened parts of the pipes were coils of heavy, insulated copper\nwire. There were no valves nor cylinders, no revolving parts: that was\nall there was to the \"motor.\"\n\nJoyce didn't yet understand the device. The water dripped from the\ntank, drop by drop, to be abruptly disintegrated, made into an\nexplosive, by being subjected to a powerful magnetic field induced in\nthe coils by a generator in the bow of the shell. As each drop of\nwater passed into the pipes, and was instantaneously broken up, there\nwas a violent but controlled explosion--and the shell was kicked\nanother hundred miles ahead on its journey. That was all Joyce knew\nabout it.\n\nHe threw the bow switch. There was a soft shock as the motor exhausted\nthrough the forward tube, slowing their speed.\n\n\"Turn on the outside generator propellers,\" ordered Wichter. \"I think\nour batteries are getting low.\"\n\nJoyce slipped the tiny, slim-bladed propellers into gear. They began\nto turn, slowly at first in the almost non-existent atmosphere.\n\n\"Four hundred miles,\" announced Wichter. \"How's the temperature?\"\n\nJoyce stepped to the thermometer that registered the heat of the outer\nwall. \"Nine hundred degrees,\" he said.\n\n\"Cut down to a thousand miles an hour,\" commanded Wichter. \"Five\nhundred as soon as the motor will catch that much. I'll keep our\ncourse straight toward this crater. It's in wells like that, that\nwe'll find livable air--if we're right in believing there is such a\nthing on Zeud.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoyce glanced at the thermometer. It still registered hundreds of\ndegrees, though their speed had been materially reduced.\n\n\"I guess there's livable air, all right,\" he said. \"It's pretty thick\noutside already.\"\n\nThe professor smiled. \"Another theory vindicated. I was sure that\nZeud, swinging on the outside of the Earth-moon-Zeud chain and hence\ntraveling at a faster rate, would pick up most of the moon's\natmosphere over a period of millions of years. Also it must have been\nshielded by the moon, to some extent, against the constant small\natmospheric leakage most celestial globes are subject to. Just the\nsame, when we land, we'll test conditions with a rat or two.\"\n\nAt a signal from him, Joyce checked their speed to four hundred miles\nan hour, then to two hundred, and then, as they descended below the\nhighest rim of the circular cliffs of the crater, almost to a full\nstop. They floated toward the surface of Zeud, watching with\nbreathless interest the panorama that unfolded beneath them.\n\nThey were nosing toward a spot that was being favored with the Zeudian\nsunrise. Sharp and clear the light rays slanted down, illuminating\nabout half the crater's floor and leaving the cliff protected half in\ndim shadow.\n\nThe illuminated part of the giant pit was as bizarre as the landscape\nof a nightmare. There were purplish trees, immense beyond belief.\nThere were broad, smooth pools of inky black fluid that was oily and\ntroubled in spots as though disturbed by some moving things under the\nsurface. There were bare, rocky patches where the stones, the long\ndrippings of ancient lava flow, were spread like bleaching gray\nskeletons of monsters. And over all, rising from pools and bare ground\nand jungle alike, was a thin, miasmic mist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSustained by the slow, steady exhaust of the motor, rising a little\nwith each partly muffled explosion and sinking a little further in\neach interval, they settled toward a bare, lava strewn spot that\nappealed to Wichter as being a good landing place. With a last hiss,\nand a grinding jar, they grounded. Joyce opened the switch to cut off\nthe generator.\n\n\"Now let's see what the air's like,\" said Wichter, lifting down a\nsmall cage in which was penned an active rat.\n\nHe opened a double panel in the shell's hull, and freed the little\nanimal. In an agony of suspense they watched it as it leaped onto the\nbare lava and halted a moment....\n\n\"Seems to like it,\" said Joyce, drawing a great breath.\n\nThe rat, as though intoxicated by its sudden freedom, raced away out\nof sight, covering eight or ten feet at a bound, its legs scurrying\nludicrously in empty air during its short flights.\n\n\"That means that we can dispense with oxygen helmets--and that we'd\nbetter take our guns,\" said Wichter, his voice tense, his eyes\nsnapping behind his glasses.\n\nHe stepped to the gun rack. In this were half a dozen air-guns. Long\nand of very small bore, they discharged a tiny steel shell in which\nwas a liquid of his invention that, about a second after the heat of\nits forced passage through the rifle barrel, expanded instantly in\ngaseous form to millions of times its liquid bulk. It was the most\npowerful explosive yet found, but one that was beautifully safe to\ncarry inasmuch as it could be exploded only by heat.\n\n\"Are we ready?\" he said, handing a gun to Joyce. \"Then--let's go!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut for a breath or two they hesitated before opening the heavy double\ndoor in the side of the hull, savoring to the full the immensity of\nthe moment.\n\nThe rapture of the explorer who is the first to set foot on a vast new\ncontinent was theirs, magnified a hundredfold. For they were the first\nto set foot on a vast new planet! An entire new world, containing\nheaven alone knew what forms of life, what monstrous or infinitesimal\ncreatures, lay before them. Even the profound awe they had experienced\nwhen landing on the moon was dwarfed by the solemnity of this\noccasion; just as it is less soul stirring to discover an arctic\ncontinent which is perpetually cased in barren ice, than to discover a\ncontinent which is warmly fruitful and, probably, teeming with life.\n\nStill wordless, too stirred to speak, they opened the vault-like door\nand stepped out--into a humid heat which was like that of their own\ntropical regions, but not so unendurable.\n\nIn their short stay on the moon, during which they had taken several\nwalks in their insulated suits, they had become somewhat accustomed to\nthe decreased weight of their bodies due to the lesser gravity, so\nthat here, where their weight was even less, they did not make any\nblunders of stepping twenty feet instead of a yard.\n\nWalking warily, glancing alertly in all directions to guard against\nany strange animals that might rush out to destroy them, they moved\ntoward the nearest stretch of jungle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first thing that arrested their attention was the size of the\ntrees they were approaching. They had got some idea of their hugeness\nfrom the shell, but viewed from ground level they loomed even larger.\nEight hundred, a thousand feet they reared their mighty tops, with\ntrunks hundreds of feet in circumference; living pyramids whose bases\nwove together to make an impenetrable ceiling over the jungle floor.\nThe leaves were thick and bloated like cactus growths, and their color\nwas a pronounced lavender.\n\n\"We must take back several of those leaves,\" said Wichter, his\nscientific soul filled with cold excitement.\n\n\"I wish we could take back some of this air, too.\" Joyce filled his\nlungs to capacity. \"Isn't it great? Like wine! It almost counteracts\nthe effects of the heat.\"\n\n\"There's more oxygen in it than in our own,\" surmised Wichter. \"My\nGod! What's that!\"\n\nThey halted for an instant. From the depths of the lavender jungle had\ncome an ear shattering, screaming hiss, as though some monstrous\nserpent were in its death agony.\n\nThey waited to hear if the noise would be repeated. It wasn't.\nDubiously they started on again.\n\n\"We'd better not go in there too far,\" said Joyce. \"If we didn't come\nout again it would cost Earth a new planet. No one else knows the\nsecret of your water-motor.\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing living can stand against these guns of ours,\" replied\nWichter confidently. \"And that noise might not have been caused by\nanything living. It might have been steam escaping from some volcanic\ncrevice.\"\n\nThey started cautiously down a well defined, hard packed trail through\nthorny lavender underbrush. As they went, Joyce blazed marks on\nvarious tree trunks marking the direction back to the shell. The tough\nfibres exuded a bluish liquid from the cuts that bubbled slowly like\nblood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo the right and left of them were cup-shaped bushes that looked like\ntraps; and that their looks were not deceiving was proved by a\nmuffled, bleating cry that rose from the compressed leaves of one of\nthem they passed. Sluggish, blind crawling things like three-foot\nslugs flowed across their path and among the tree trunks, leaving\nviscous trails of slime behind them. And there were larger things....\n\n\"Careful,\" said Wichter suddenly, coming to a halt and peering into\nthe gloom at their right.\n\n\"What did you see?\" whispered Joyce.\n\nWichter shook his head. The gigantic, two-legged, purplish figure he\nhad dimly made out in the steamy dark, had moved away. \"I don't know.\nIt looked a little like a giant ape.\"\n\nThey halted and took stock of their situation, mechanically wiping\nperspiration from their streaming faces, and pondering as to whether\nor not they should turn back. Joyce, who was far from being a coward,\nthought they should.\n\n\"In this undergrowth,\" he pointed out, \"we might be rushed before we\ncould even fire our guns. And we're nearly a mile from the shell.\"\n\nBut Wichter was like an eager child.\n\n\"We'll press on just a little,\" he urged. \"To that clear spot in front\nof us.\" He pointed along the trail to where sunlight was blazing down\nthrough an opening in the trees. \"As soon as we see what's there,\nwe'll go back.\"\n\nWith a shrug, Joyce followed the eager little man down the weird trail\nunder the lavender trees. In a few moments they had reached the\nclearing which was Wichter's goal. They halted on its edge, gazing at\nit with awe and repulsion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a circular quagmire of festering black mud about a hundred\nyards across. Near at hand they could see the mud heaving, very\nslowly, as though abysmal forms of life were tunneling along just\nunder the surface. They glanced toward the center of the bog, which\nwas occupied by one of the smooth black pools, and cried aloud at\nwhat they saw.\n\nAt the brink of the pool was lying a gigantic creature like a great,\nthick snake--a snake with a lizard's head, and a series of\nmany-jointed, scaled legs running down its powerful length. Its mouth\nwas gaping open to reveal hundreds of needle-sharp, backward pointing\nteeth. Its legs and thick, stubbed tail were threshing feebly in the\nmud as though it were in distress; and its eyes, so small as to be\ninvisible in its repulsive head, were glazed and dull.\n\n\"Was that what we heard back a ways?\" wondered Joyce.\n\n\"Probably,\" said Wichter. His eyes shone as he gazed at the nightmare\nshape. Impulsively he took a step toward the stirring mud.\n\n\"Don't be entirely insane,\" snapped Joyce, catching his arm.\n\n\"I must see it closer,\" said Wichter, tugging to be free.\n\n\"Then we'll climb a tree and look down on it. We'll probably be safer\nup off the ground anyway.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey ascended the nearest jungle giant--whose rubbery bark was so\nringed and scored as to be as easy to climb as a staircase--to the\nfirst great bough, about fifty feet from the ground, and edged out\ntill they hung over the rim of the quagmire. From there, with the aid\nof their binoculars, they expected to see the dying monster in every\ndetail. But when they looked toward the pool it was not in sight!\n\n\"Were we seeing things?\" exclaimed Wichter, rubbing his glasses. \"I'd\nhave sworn it was lying there!\"\n\n\"It was,\" said Joyce grimly. \"Look at the pool. That'll tell you where\nit went.\"\n\nThe black, secretive surface was bubbling and waving as though, down\nin its depths, a terrific fight were taking place.\n\n\"Something came up and dragged our ten-legged lizard down to its den.\nThen that something's brothers got onto the fact that a feast was\nbeing held, and rushed in. That pool would be no place for a\nbefore-breakfast dip!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWichter started to say something in reply, then gazed, hypnotized, at\nthe opposite wall of the jungle.\n\nFrom the dense screen of lavender foliage stretched a glistening,\nscale-armored neck, as thick as a man's body at its thinnest point,\nwhich was just behind a tremendous-jawed crocodilian head. It tapered\nback for a distance of at least thirty feet, to merge into a body as\nbig as that of a terrestial whale, that was supported by four squat,\nponderous legs.\n\nMoving with surprising rapidity, the enormous thing slid into the mud\nand began ploughing a way, belly deep, toward the pool. Shapeless,\nslow-writhing forms were cast up in its wake, to quiver for a moment\nin the sunlight and then melt below the mud again.\n\nOne of the bloated, formless mud-crawlers was snapped up in the huge\njaws with an abrupt plunge of the long neck, and the monster began to\nfeed, hog-like, slobbering over the loathsome carcass.\n\nWichter shook his head, half in fanatical eagerness, half in despair.\n\"I'd like to stay and see more,\" he said with a sigh, \"but if that's\nthe kind of creatures we're apt to encounter in the Zeudian jungle,\nwe'd better be going at once--\"\n\n\"Sh-h!\" snapped Joyce. Then, in a barely audible whisper: \"I think the\nthing heard your voice!\"\n\nThe monster had abruptly ceased its feeding. Its head, thrust high in\nthe air, was waving inquisitively from side to side. Suddenly it\nexpelled the air from its vast lungs in a roaring cough--and started\ndirectly for their tree.\n\n\"Shoot!\" cried Wichter, raising his gun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoving with the speed of an express train, the monster had almost got\nto their overhanging branch before they could pull the triggers. Both\nshells imbedded themselves in the enormous chest, just as the long\nneck reached up for them. And at once things began to happen with\ncataclysmic rapidity.\n\nAlmost with their impact the shells exploded. The monster stopped,\nwith a great hole torn in its body. Then, dying on its feet, it thrust\nits great head up and its huge jaws crunched over the branch to which\nits two puny destroyers were clinging.\n\nWith all its dozens of tons of weight, it jerked in a gargantuan death\nagony. The tree, enormous as it was, shook with it, and the branch\nitself was tossed as though in a hurricane.\n\nThere was a splintering sound. Wichter and Joyce dropped their guns to\ncling more tightly to the bole of the drooping branch that was their\nonly security. The guns glanced off the mountainous body--and, with a\nlast convulsion of the mighty legs, were swept underneath!\n\nThe monster was still at last, its insensate jaws yet gripping the\nbough. The two men looked at each other in speechless consternation.\nThe shell a mile off through the dreadful jungle.... Themselves,\nhelpless without their guns....\n\n\"Well,\" said Joyce at last. \"I guess we'd better be on our way.\nWaiting here, thinking it over, won't help any. Lucky there's no\nnight, for a couple of weeks at least, to come stealing down on us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe started down the great trunk, with Wichter following close behind.\nWalking as rapidly as they could, they hurried back along the tunneled\ntrail toward their shell.\n\nThey hadn't covered a hundred yards when they heard a mighty crashing\nof underbrush behind them. Glancing back, they saw tooth-studded jaws\ngaping cavernously at the end of a thirty-foot neck--little,\ndead-looking eyes glaring at them--a hundred-foot body smashing its\nway over the trap-bushes and through tangles of vines and\ndown-drooping branches.\n\n\"The mate to the thing we killed back there!\" Joyce panted. \"Run, for\nGod's sake!\"\n\nWichter needed no urging. He hadn't an ounce of fear in his spare,\nsmall body. But he had an overwhelming desire to get back to Earth and\ndeliver his message. He was trembling as he raced after Joyce, thirty\nfeet to a bound, ducking his head to avoid hitting the thick lavender\nfoliage that roofed the trail.\n\n\"One of us must get through!\" he panted over and over. \"One of us must\nmake it!\"\n\nIt was speedily apparent that they could never outrun their pursuer.\nThe reaching jaws were only a few yards behind them now.\n\n\"You go,\" called Joyce, sobbing for breath. He slowed his pace\ndeliberately.\n\n\"No--you--\" Wichter slowed too. In a frenzy, Joyce shoved him along\nthe trail.\n\n\"I tell you--\"\n\nHe got no further. In front of them, where there had appeared to be\nsolid ground, they suddenly saw a yawning pit. Desperately, they tried\nto veer aside, but they were too close. Their last long birdlike leap\ncarried them over the edge. They fell, far down, into a deep chasm,\nsplashing into a shallow pool of water.\n\nA few clods of earth cascaded after them as the monster above dug its\ngreat splay feet into the ground and checked its rush in time to keep\nfrom falling after them. Then the top of the pit slowly darkened as a\ncovering of some sort slid across it. They were in a prison as\nprofoundly quiet and utterly black as a tomb.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dorn,\" shouted Joyce. \"Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" came a voice in the near darkness. \"And you?\"\n\n\"I'm still in one piece as far as I can feel.\" There was a splashing\nnoise. He waded toward it and in a moment his outstretched hand\ntouched the professor's shoulder.\n\n\"This is a fine mess,\" he observed shakily. \"We got away from those\ntooth-lined jaws, all right, but I'm wondering if we're much better\noff than we would have been if we hadn't escaped.\"\n\n\"I'm wondering the same thing.\" Wichter's voice was strained. \"Did you\nsee the way the top of the pit closed above us? That means we're in a\ntrap. And a most ingenious trap it is, too! The roof of it is\ncamouflaged until it looks exactly like the rest of the trail floor.\nThe water in here is just shallow enough to let large animals break\ntheir necks when they fall in and just deep enough to preserve small\nanimals--like ourselves--alive. We're in the hands of some sort of\nreasoning, intelligent beings, Joyce!\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Joyce with a shudder, \"we'd better do our best to\nget out of here!\"\n\nBut this was found to be impossible. They couldn't climb up out of the\npit, and nowhere could they feel any openings in the walls. Only\nsmooth, impenetrable stone met their questing fingers.\n\n\"It looks as though we're in to stay,\" said Joyce finally. \"At least\nuntil our Zeudian hosts, whatever kind of creatures they may be, come\nand take us out. What'll we do then? Sail in and die fighting? Or go\npeaceably along with them--assuming we aren't killed at once--on the\nchance that we can make a break later?\"\n\n\"I'd advise the latter,\" answered Wichter. \"There is a small animal on\nour own planet whose example might be a good one for us to follow.\nThat's the 'possum.\" He stopped abruptly, and gripped Joyce's arm.\n\nFrom the opposite side of the pit came a grating sound. A crack of\ngreenish light appeared, low down near the water. This widened jerkily\nas though a door were being hoisted by some sort of pulley\narrangement. The walls of the pit began to glow faintly with\nreflected light.\n\n\"Down,\" breathed Wichter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNoiselessly they let themselves sink into the water until they were\nfloating, eyes closed and motionless, on the surface. Playing dead to\nthe best of their ability, they waited for what might happen next.\n\nThey heard a splashing near the open rock door. The splashing neared them,\nand high-pitched hissing syllables came to their ears--variegated sounds\nthat resembled excited conversation in some unknown language.\n\nJoyce felt himself touched by something, and it was all he could do to\nkeep from shouting aloud and springing to his feet at the contact.\n\nHe'd had no idea, of course, what might be the nature of their\ncaptors, but he had imagined them as man-like, to some extent at\nleast. And the touch of his hand, or flipper, or whatever it was,\nindicated that they were not!\n\nThey were cold-blooded, reptilian things, for the flesh that had\ntouched him was cold; as clammy and repulsive as the belly of a dead\nfish. So repulsive was that flesh that, when he presently felt himself\nlifted high up and roughly carried, he shuddered in spite of himself\nat the contact.\n\nInstantly the thing that bore him stopped. Joyce held his breath. He\nfelt an excruciating, stabbing pain in his arm, after which the\njourney through the water was resumed. Stubbornly he kept up his\npretence of lifelessness.\n\nThe splashing ceased, and he heard flat wet feet slapping along on dry\nrock, indicating that they had emerged from the pit. Then he sank into\nreal unconsciousness.\n\nThe next thing he knew was that he was lying on smooth, bare rock in a\nperfect bedlam of noises. Howls and grunts, snuffling coughs and\nsnarls beat at his ear-drums. It was as though he had fallen into a\nvast cage in which were hundreds of savage, excited animals--animals,\nhowever, that in spite of their excitement and ferocity were\nsurprisingly motionless, for he heard no scraping of claws, or padding\nof feet.\n\nCautiously he opened his eyes....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was in a large cave, the walls of which were glowing with greenish,\nphosphorescent light. Strewn about the floor were seemingly dead\ncarcasses of animals. And what carcasses there were! Blubber-coated\nthings that looked like giant tadpoles, gazelle-like creatures with a\nsingle, long slim horn growing from delicate small skulls, four-legged\nbeasts and six-legged ones, animals with furry hides and crawlers with\nscaled coverings--several hundred assorted specimens of the smaller\nlife of Zeud lay stretched out in seeming lifelessness.\n\nBut they were not dead, these bizarre beasts of another world. They\nlived, and were animated with the frenzied fear of trapped things.\nJoyce could see the tortured heaving of their furred and scaled sides\nas they panted with terror. And from their throats issued the\noutlandish noises he had heard. They were alive enough--only they\nseemed unable to move!\n\nThere was nothing in his range of vision that might conceivably be the\nbeings that had captured them, so Joyce started to lift his head and\nlook around at the rest of the cavern. He found that he could not\nmove. He tried again, and his body was as unresponsive as a log. In\nfact, he couldn't feel his body at all! In growing terror, he\nconcentrated all his will on moving his arm. It was as limp as a rag.\n\nHe relaxed, momentarily in the grip of stark, blind panic. He was as\nhelpless as the howling things around him! He was numbed, completely\nparalyzed into immobility!\n\nThe professor's voice--a weak, uncertain voice--sounded from behind\nhim. \"Joyce! Joyce!\"\n\nHe found that he could talk, that the paralysis that gripped the rest\nof his muscles had not extended to the vocal cords. \"Dorn! Thank God\nyou're alive! I couldn't see you, and I thought--\"\n\n\"I'm alive, but that's about all,\" said Wichter. \"I--I can't move.\"\n\n\"Neither can I. We've been drugged in some manner--just as all the\nother animals in here have been drugged. I must have got my dose in\nthe pit. I was cut, or stabbed, in the arm.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoyce stopped talking as he suddenly heard steps, like human footsteps\nyet weirdly different--flap-flapping sounds as though awkward flippers\nwere slapping along the rock floor toward them. The steps stopped\nwithin a few feet of them; then, after what seemed hours, they sounded\nagain, this time in front of him.\n\nHe opened his eyes, cautiously, barely moving his eyelids, and saw at\nlast, in every hideous detail, one of the super-beasts that had\ncaptured Wichter and himself.\n\nIt was a horrible cartoon of a man, the thing that stood there in the\ngreenish glow of the cave. Nine or ten feet high, it loomed; hairless,\nwith a faintly iridescent, purplish hide. A thick, cylindrical trunk\nsloped into a neck only a little smaller than the body itself. Set on\nthis was a bony, ugly head that was split clear across by lipless\njaws. There was no nose, only slanted holes like the nostrils of an\nanimal; and over these were set pale, expressionless, pupil-less eyes.\nThe arms were short and thick and ended in bifurcated lumps of flesh\nlike swollen hands encased in old-fashioned mittens. The legs were\nalso grotesquely short, and the feet mere shapeless flaps.\n\nIt was standing near one of the smaller animals, apparently regarding\nit closely. Observing it himself, Joyce saw that it was moving a\nlittle. As though coming out of a coma, it was raising its bizarre\nhead and trying to get on its feet.\n\nLeisurely the two-legged monster bent over it. Two long fangs gleamed\nin the lipless mouth. These were buried in the neck of the reviving\nbeast--and instantly it sank back into immobility.\n\nHaving reduced it to helplessness--the monster ate it! The lipless\njaws gaped widely. The shapeless hands forced in the head of the\nanimal. The throat muscles expanded hugely: and in less than a minute\nit had swallowed its living prey as a boa-constrictor swallows a\nmonkey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoyce closed his eyes, feeling weak and nauseated. He didn't open them\nagain till long after he had heard the last of the awkward, flapping\nfootsteps.\n\n\"Could you see it?\" asked Wichter, who was lying so closely behind him\nthat he couldn't observe the monstrous Zeudian. \"What did it do? What\nwas it like?\"\n\nJoyce told him of the way the creature had fed. \"We are evidently in\ntheir provision room,\" he concluded. \"They keep some of their food\nalive, it seems.... Well, it's a quick death.\"\n\n\"Tell me more about the way the other animal moved, just before it was\neaten.\"\n\n\"There isn't much to tell,\" said Joyce wearily. \"It didn't move long\nafter those fangs were sunk into it.\"\n\n\"But don't you see!\" There was sudden hope in Wichter's voice. \"That\nmeans that the effect of the poison, which is apparently injected by\nthose fangs, wears off after a time. And in that case--\"\n\n\"In that case,\" Joyce interjected, \"we'd have only an unknown army of\nten-foot Zeudians, the problem of finding a way to the surface of the\nground again, and the lack of any kind of weapons, to keep us from\nescaping!\"\n\n\"We're not quite weaponless, though,\" the professor whispered back.\n\"Over in a corner there's a pile of the long, slender horns that\nsprout from the heads of some of these creatures. Evidently the\nZeudians cut them out, or break them off before eating that\nparticular type of animal. They'd be as good as lances, if we could\nget hold of them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoyce said nothing, but hope began to beat in his own breast. He had\nnoticed a significant happening during the age-long hours in the\ncommissary cave. Most of the Zeudians had entered from the direction\nof the pit. But one had come in through an opening in the opposite\nside. And this one had blinked pale eyes as though dazzled from bright\nsunlight--and was bearing some large, woody looking tubers that seemed\nto have been freshly uprooted! There was a good chance, thought Joyce,\nthat that opening led to a tunnel up to the world above!\n\nHe drew a deep breath--and felt a dim pain in his back, caused by the\ncramping position in which he had lain for so long.\n\nHe could have shouted aloud with the thrill of that discovery. This\nwas the first time he had felt his body at all! Did it mean that the\neffect of the poison was wearing off--that it wasn't as lastingly\nparalyzing to his earthly nerve centers as to those of Zeudian\ncreatures around them? He flexed the muscles of his leg. The leg moved\na fraction of an inch.\n\n\"Dorn!\" he called softly, \"I can move a little! Can you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Wichter answered, \"I've been able to wriggle my fingers for\nseveral minutes. I think I could walk in an hour or two.\"\n\n\"Then pray for that hour or two. It might mean our escape!\" Joyce told\nhim of the seldom used entrance that he thought led to the open air.\n\"I'm sure it goes to the surface, Dorn. Those woody looking tubers had\nbeen freshly picked.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree of the two-legged monsters came in just then. They relapsed into\nlifeless silence. There was a horrible moment as the three paused over\nthem longer than any of the others had. Was it obvious that the\neffects of the numbing poison was wearing off? Would they be bitten\nagain--or eaten?\n\nThe Zeudians finally moved on, hissing and clicking to each other.\nEventually the cold-blooded things fed, and dragged lethargically out\nof the cave in the direction of the pit.\n\nWith every passing minute Joyce could feel life pouring back into his\nnumbed body. His cramped muscles were in agony now--a pain that gave\nhim fierce pleasure. At last, risking observation, he lifted his head\nand then struggled to a sitting position and looked around.\n\nNo Zeudian was in sight. Evidently they were too sure of their poison\nglands to post a guard over them. He listened intently, and could hear\nno dragging footsteps. He turned to Wichter, who had followed his\nexample and was sitting up, feebly rubbing his body to restore\ncirculation.\n\n\"Now's our chance,\" he whispered. \"Stand up and walk a little to\nsteady your legs, while I go over and get us a couple of those sharp\nhorns. Then we'll see where that entrance of mine goes!\"\n\nHe walked to the pile of bones and horns in the corner and selected\ntwo of the longest and slimmest of the ivory-like things. Just as he\nhad rejoined Wichter he heard the sound with which he was now so\ngrimly familiar--flapping, awkward footsteps. Wildly he signaled the\nprofessor. They dropped in their tracks, just as the approaching\nmonster stumped into the cave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an instant he dared hope that their movement had gone unobserved,\nbut his hope was rudely shattered. He heard a sharp hiss: heard the\nZeudian flap toward them at double-quick time. Abandoning all\npretense, he sprang to his feet just as the thing reached him, its\nfangs gleaming wickedly in the greenish light.\n\nHe leaped to the side, going twenty feet or more with the press of his\nEarth muscles against the reduced gravity. The creature rushed on\ntoward the professor. That game little man crouched and awaited its\nonslaught. But Joyce had sprung back again before the two could clash.\n\nHe raised the long horn and plunged it into the smooth, purplish back.\nAgain and again he drove it home, as the monster writhed under him. It\nhad enormous vitality. Gashed and dripping, it yet struggled on,\nattempting to encircle Joyce with its stubby arms. Once it succeeded,\nand he felt his ribs crack as it contracted its powerful body. But a\nfinal stroke finished the savage fight. He got up and, with an\nincoherent cry to Wichter, raced toward the opening on which they\npinned their hopes of reaching the upper air.\n\nHissing cries and the thudding of many feet came to them just as they\nreached the arched mouth of the passage. But the cries, and the\nconstant pandemonium of the paralysed animals died behind them as they\nbounded along the tunnel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey emerged at last into the sunlight they had never expected to see\nagain, beside one of the great lavender trees. They paused an instant\nto try to get their bearings.\n\n\"This way,\" panted Joyce as he saw, on a hard-packed path ahead of\nthem, one of the trail-marks he had blazed.\n\nDown the trail they raced, toward their space shell. Fortunately they\nmet none of the tremendous animals that infested the jungles; and\ntheir journey to the clearing in which the shell was lying was\naccomplished without accident.\n\n\"We're safe now,\" gasped Wichter, as they came in sight of the bare\nlava patch. \"We can outrun them five feet to their one!\"\n\nThey burst into the clearing--and halted abruptly. Surrounding the\nshell, stumping curiously about it and touching it with their\nshapeless hands, were dozens of the Zeudians.\n\n\"My God!\" groaned Joyce. \"There must be at least a hundred of them!\nWe're lost for certain now!\"\n\nThey stared with hopeless longing at the vehicle that, if only they\ncould reach it, could carry them back to Earth. Then they turned to\neach other and clasped hands, without a word. The same thought was in\nthe mind of each--to rush at the swarming monsters and fight till they\nwere killed. There was absolutely no chance of winning through to the\nshell, but it was infinitely better to die fighting than be swallowed\nalive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo engrossed were the Zeudians by the strange thing that had fallen\ninto their province, that Joyce and Wichter got within a hundred feet\nof them before they turned their pale eyes in their direction. Then,\nbaring their fangs, they streamed toward the Earth men, just as the\npursuing Zeudians entered the clearing from the jungle trail.\n\nThe two prepared to die as effectively as possible. Each grasped his\nlace-like horn tightly. The professor mechanically adjusted his\nglasses more firmly on his nose....\n\nWith his move, the narrowing circle of Zeudians halted. A violent\nclamor broke out among them. They glared at the two, but made no\nfurther step toward them.\n\n\"What in the world--\" began Wichter bewilderedly.\n\n\"Your glasses!\" Joyce shouted, gripping his shoulder. \"When you moved\nthem, they all stopped! They must be afraid of them, somehow. Take\nthem clear off and see what happens.\"\n\nWichter removed his spectacles, and swung them in his hand, peering\nnear-sightedly at the crowding Zeudians.\n\nTheir reaction to his simple move was remarkable! Hisses of\nconsternation came from their lipless mouths. They faced each other\nuneasily, waving their stubby arms and covering their own eyes as\nthough suddenly afraid they would lose them.\n\nTaking advantage of their indecision, Joyce and Wichter walked boldly\ntoward them. They moved aside, forming a reluctant lane. Some of the\nZeudians in the rear shoved to close in on them, but the ones in front\nheld them back. It wasn't until the two were nearly through that the\nlane began to straggle into a threatening circle around them again.\nThe Zeudians were evidently becoming reassured by the fact that\nWichter continued to see all right in spite of the little strange\ncreature's alarming act of removing his eyes.\n\n\"Do it again,\" breathed Joyce, perspiration beading his forehead as\nthe giants moved closed, their fangs tentatively bared for the numbing\npoison stroke.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWichter popped his glasses on, then jerked them off with a cry, as\nthough he were suffering intensely. Once more the Zeudians faltered\nand drew back, feeling at their own eyes.\n\n\"Run!\" cried Joyce. And they raced for the haven of the shell.\n\nThe Zeudians swarmed after them, snarling and hissing. Barely ahead of\nthe nearest, Joyce and Wichter dove into the open panel. They slammed\nit closed just as a powerful, stubby arm reached after them. There was\na screaming hiss, and a cold, cartilagenous lump of flesh dropped to\nthe floor of the shell--half the monster's hand, sheared off between\nthe sharp edge of the door and the metal hull.\n\nJoyce threw in the generator switch. With a soft roar the water-motor\nexploded into action, sending the shell far into the sky.\n\n\"When we return,\" said Joyce, adding a final thousand miles an hour to\ntheir speed before they should fly free of the atmosphere of Zeud, \"I\nthink we'd better come at the head of an army, equipped with air-guns\nand explosive bombs.\"\n\n\"And with glasses,\" added the professor, taking off his spectacles and\ngazing at them as though seeing them for the first time.\n\n\n\n\nFour Miles Within\n\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\n\n_By Anthony Gilmore_\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_The Monster of Metal_\n\n[Illustration: The man hurled the empty gun at the monster.]\n\n[Sidenote: Far down into the earth goes a gleaming metal sphere whose\npassengers are deadly enemies.]\n\n\nA strange spherical monster stood in the moonlight on the silent\nMojave Desert. In the ghostly gray of the sand and sage and joshua\ntrees its metal hide glimmered dully--an amazing object to be found on\nthat lonely spot. But there was only pride and anticipation in the\neyes of the three people who stood a little way off, looking at it.\nFor they had constructed the strange sphere, and were soon going to\nentrust their lives to it.\n\n\"Professor,\" said one of them, a young man with a cheerful face and a\nlikable grin, \"let's go down now! There's no use waiting till\nto-morrow. It's always dark down there, whether it's day or night up\nhere. Everything is ready.\"\n\nThe white-haired Professor David Guinness smiled tolerantly at the\nspeaker, his partner, Phil Holmes. \"I'm kind of eager to be off,\nmyself,\" he admitted. He turned to the third person in the little\ngroup, a dark-haired girl. \"What do you say, Sue?\"\n\n\"Oh, let's, Father!\" came the quick reply. \"We'd never be able to\nsleep to-night, anyway. As Phil says, everything is ready.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess that settles it,\" Professor Guinness said to the eager\nyoung man.\n\nPhil Holmes' face went aglow with anticipation. \"Good!\" he cried.\n\"Good! I'll skip over and get some water. It's barely possible that\nit'll be hot down there, in spite of your eloquent logic to the\ncontrary!\" And with the words he caught up a large jug standing\nnearby, waved his hand, said: \"I'll be right back!\" and set out for\nthe water-hole, situated nearly a mile away from their little camp.\nThe heavy hush of the desert night settled down once more after he\nleft.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs his figure merged with the shadows in the distance, the elderly\nscientist murmured aloud to his daughter:\n\n\"You know, it's good to realize that my dream is about to become a\nreality. If it hadn't been for Phil.... Or no--I really ought to thank\nyou, Sue. You're the one responsible for his participation!\" And he\nsmiled fondly at the slender girl by his side.\n\n\"Phil joined us just for the scientific interest, and for the thrill\nof going four miles down into the earth,\" she retorted at once, in\nspite of the blush her father saw on her face. But he did not insist.\nOnce more he turned, as to a magnet, to the machine that was his\nhandiwork.\n\nThe fifteen-foot sphere was an earth-borer--Guinness's own invention.\nIn it he had utilized for the first time for boring purposes the newly\ndeveloped atomic disintegrators. Many holes equally spaced over the\nsphere were the outlets for the dissolving ray--most of them on the\nbottom and alternating with them on the bottom and sides were the\noutlets of powerful rocket propulsion tubes, which would enable it to\nrise easily from the hole it would presently blast into the earth. A\nsmall, tight-fitting door gave entrance to the double-walled interior,\nwhere, in spite of the space taken up by batteries and mechanisms and\nan enclosed gyroscope for keeping the borer on an even keel, there was\nroom for several people.\n\nThe earth-borer had been designed not so much for scientific\ninvestigation as the specific purpose of reaching a rich store of\nradium ore buried four miles below the Guinness desert camp. Many\ngeologists and mining engineers knew that the radium was there, for\ntheir instruments had proven it often; but no one up to then knew how\nto get to it. David Guinness did--first. The borer had been\nconstructed in his laboratory in San Francisco, then dismantled and\nfreighted to the little desert town of Palmdale, from whence Holmes\nhad brought the parts to their isolated camp by truck. Strict secrecy\nhad been kept. Rather than risk assistants they had done all the work\nthemselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFifteen minutes passed by, while the slight figure of the inventor\nputtered about the interior of the sphere, brightly lit by a\ndetachable searchlight, inspecting all mechanisms in preparation for\ntheir descent. Sue stood by the door watching him, now and then\nturning to scan the desert for the returning Phil.\n\nIt was then, startlingly sudden, that there cracked through the velvet\nnight the faint, distant sound of a gun. And it came from the\ndirection of the water-hole.\n\nSue's face went white, and she trembled. Without a word her father\nstepped out of the borer and looked at her.\n\n\"That was a gun!\" he said. \"Phil didn't have one with him, did he?\"\n\n\"No,\" Sue whispered. \"And--why, there's nobody within miles of here!\"\n\nThe two looked at each other with alarm and wonder. Then, from one of\nthe broken patches of scrub that ringed the space in which the borer\nstood, came a mocking voice.\n\n\"Ah, you're mistaken, Sue,\" it affirmed. \"But that was a gun.\"\n\nDavid Guinness jerked around, as did his daughter. The man who had\nspoken stood only ten yards away, clearly outlined in the bright\nmoonlight--a tall, well-built man, standing quite at ease, surveying\nthem pleasantly. His smile did not change when old Guinness cried:\n\n\"Quade! James Quade!\"\n\nThe man nodded and came slowly forward. He might have been considered\nhandsome, had it not been for his thin, mocking lips and a swarthy\ncomplexion.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" demanded Guinness angrily. \"And what do you\nmean--'it was a gun?' Have you--\"\n\n\"Easy, easy--one thing at a time,\" said Quade, still smiling. \"About\nthe gun--well, your young friend Holmes said, he'd be right back, but\nI--I'm afraid he won't be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSue Guinness's lips formed a frightened word:\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nQuade made a short movement with his left hand, as is brushing the\nquery aside. \"Let's talk about something more pleasant,\" he said, and\nlooked back at the professor. \"The radium, and your borer, for\ninstance. I hear you're all ready to go down.\"\n\nDavid Guinness gasped. \"How did you know--?\" he began, but a surge of\nanger choked him, and his fists clenched. He stepped forward. But\nsomething came to life in James Quade's right hand and pointed\nmenacingly at him. It was the stubby black shape of an automatic.\n\n\"Keep back, you old fool!\" Quade said harshly. \"I don't want to have\nto shoot you!\"\n\nUnwillingly, Guinness came to a stop. \"What have you done with young\nHolmes?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Never mind about him now,\" said Quade, smiling again. \"Perhaps I'll\nexplain later. At the moment there's something much more interesting\nto do. Possibly you'll be surprised to hear it, but we're all going to\ntake a little ride in this machine of yours, Professor. Down. About\nfour miles. I'll have to ask you to do the driving. You will, won't\nyou--without making a fuss?\"\n\nGuinness's face worked furiously. \"Why, you're crazy, Quade!\" he\nsputtered. \"I certainly won't!\"\n\n\"No?\" asked Quade softly. The automatic he held veered around, till it\nwas pointing directly at the girl. \"I wouldn't want to have to shoot\nSue--say--through the hand....\" His finger tightened perceptibly on\nthe trigger.\n\n\"You're mad, man!\" Guinness burst out. \"You're crazy! What's the\nidea--\"\n\n\"In due time I'll tell you. But now I'll ask you just once more,\"\nQuade persisted. \"Will you enter that borer, or must I--\" He broke off\nwith an expressive shrug.\n\nDavid Guinness was powerless. He had not the slightest idea what Quade\nmight be about; the one thought that broke through his fear and anger\nwas that the man was mad, and had better be humored. He trembled, and\na tight sensation came to his throat at sight of the steady gun\ntrained on his daughter. He dared not trifle.\n\n\"I'll do it,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames Quade laughed. \"That's better. You always were essentially\nreasonable, though somewhat impulsive for a man of your age. The rash\nway you severed our partnership, for instance.... But enough of that.\nI think we'd better leave immediately. Into the sphere, please. You\nfirst, Miss Guinness.\"\n\n\"Must she come?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so. I can't very well leave her here all unprotected, can\nI?\"\n\nQuade's voice was soft and suave, but an undercurrent of sarcasm ran\nthrough it. Guinness winced under it; his whole body was trembling\nwith suppressed rage and indignation. As he stepped to the door of the\nearth-borer he turned and asked:\n\n\"How did you know our plans? About the radium?--the borer?\"\n\nQuade told him. \"Have you forgotten,\" he said, \"that you talked the\nmatter over with me before we split last year? I simply had the\nlaboratory watched, and when you got new financial backing from young\nHolmes, and came here. I followed you. Simple, eh?... Well, enough of\nthis. Get inside. You first, Sue.\"\n\nTrembling, the girl obeyed, and when her father hesitated Quade jammed\nhis gun viciously into his ribs and pushed him to the door. \"Inside!\"\nhe hissed, and reluctantly, hatred in his eyes, the professor stepped\ninto the control compartment after Sue. Quade gave a last quick glance\naround and, with gun ever wary, passed inside. The door slammed shut:\nthere was a click as its lock shot over. The sphere was a sealed ball\nof metal.\n\nInside, David Guinness obeyed the automatic's imperious gesture and\npulled a shiny-handled lever slowly back, and the hush that rested\nover the Mojave was shattered by a tremendous bellow, a roar that\nshook the very earth. It was the disintegrating blast, hurled out of\nthe bottom in many fan-shaped rays. The coarse gray sand beneath the\nmachine stirred and flew wildly; the sphere vibrated madly; and then\nthe thunder lowered in tone to a mighty humming and the earth-borer\nbegan to drop. Slowly it fell, at first, then more rapidly. The shiny\ntop came level with the ground: disappeared; and in a moment there was\nnothing left but a gaping hole where a short while before a round\nmonster of metal had stood. The hole was hot and dark, and from it\ncame a steadily diminishing thunder....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long time no one in the earth-borer spoke--didn't even try\nto--for though the thunder of the disintegrators was muted, inside, to\na steady drone, conversation was almost impossible. The three were\ncrowded quite close in the spherical inner control compartment. Sue\nsat on a little collapsible stool by the bowed, but by no means\nsubdued, figure of Professor David Guinness, while Quade sat on the\nwire guard of the gyroscope, which was in the exact center of the\nfloor.\n\nThe depth gauge showed two hundred feet. Already the three people were\nnumb from the vibration; they hardly felt any sensation at all, save\none of great weight pressing inwards. The compartment was fairly cool\nand the air good--kept so by the automatic air rectifiers and the\ninsulation, which shut out the heat born of their passage.\n\nQuade had been carefully watching Guinness's manipulation of the\ncontrols, when he was struck by a thought. At once he stood up, and\nshouted in the elderly inventor's ear: \"Try the rockets! I want to be\nsure this thing will go back up!\"\n\nWithout a word Guinness shoved back the lever controlling the\ndisintegrators, at the same time whirling a small wheel full over. The\nthudding drone died away to a whisper, and was replaced by sharper\nthundering, as the stream of the propulsion rockets beneath the sphere\nwas released. A delicate needle trembled on a gauge, danced at the\nfigure two hundred, then crept back to one-ninety ... one-sixty ...\none-forty.... Quade's eyes took in everything.\n\n\"Excellent, Guinness!\" he yelled. \"Now--down once more!\"\n\nThe rockets were slowly cut; the borer jarred at the bottom of its\nhole; again the disintegrators droned out. The sphere dug rapidly into\nthe warm ground, biting lower and lower. At ten miles an hour it\nblasted a path to depths hitherto unattainable to man, sweeping away\nrock and gravel and sand--everything that stood in its way. The depth\ngauge rose to two thousand, then steadily to three and four. So it\nwent on for nearly half an hour.\n\nAt the end of that time, at a depth of nearly four miles, Quade got\nstiffly to his feet and once more shouted into the professor's ear.\n\n\"We ought to be close to that radium, now,\" he said. \"I think--\"\n\nBut his words stopped short. The floor of the sphere suddenly fell\naway from their feet, and they felt themselves tumbled into a wild\nplunge. The drone of the disintegrators, hitherto muffled by the earth\nthey bit into, rose to a hollow scream. Before the professor quite\nknew what was happening, there was a stunning crash, a shriek of\ntortured metal--and the earth-borer rocked and lay still....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole world seemed to be filled with thunder when David Guinness\ncame back to consciousness. He opened his eyes and stared up into a\ndarkness to which it took him some time to accustom himself. When he\ndid, he made out hazily that he was lying on the floor of a vast dark\ncavern. He could dimly see its jagged roof, perhaps fifty feet above.\nThere was the strong smell of damp earth in his nostrils; his head was\nsplitting from the steady drone in his ear-drums. Suddenly he\nremembered what had happened. He groaned slightly and tried to sit up.\n\nBut he could not. His arms and legs were tied. Someone had removed him\nfrom the earth-borer and bound him on the floor of the cavern they had\nplunged into.\n\nDavid Guinness strained at the rope. It was futile, but in doing so he\ntwisted his head around and saw another form, similarly tied, lying\nclose to him. He gave a little cry of relief. It was Sue. And she was\nconscious, her eyes on his face.\n\nShe spoke to him, but he could not understand her for the drone in his\nears, and when he spoke to her it was the same. But the professor did\nnot just then continue his effort to converse with her. His attention\nwas drawn to the borer, now dimly illuminated by its portable light,\nwhich had been secured to the door. It was right side up, and appeared\nto be undamaged. The broad ray of the searchlight fell far away on one\nof the cavern's rough walls. He could just make out James Quade\nstanding there, his back towards them.\n\nHe was hacking at the wall with a pick. Presently he dropped the tool\nand wrenched at the rock with bare hands. A large chunk came loose. He\nhugged it to him and turned and strode back towards the two on the\nfloor, and as he drew near they could plainly see a gleam of triumph\nin his eyes.\n\n\"You know what this is?\" he shouted. Guinness could only faintly hear\nhim. \"Wealth! Millions! Of course we always knew the radium was here,\nbut this is the proof. And now we've a way of getting it out--thanks\nto your borer! All the credit is yours, Professor Guinness! You shall\nhave the credit, and I'll have the money.\"\n\nGuinness tugged furiously at his bonds again. \"You--you--\" he gasped.\n\"How dare you tie us this way! Release us at once! What do you mean by\nit?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuade smiled unpleasantly. \"You're very stupid, Guinness. Haven't you\nguessed by now what I'm going to do?\" He paused, as if waiting for an\nanswer, and the smile on his face gave way to a look of savage menace.\nFor the first time his bitter feelings came to the surface.\n\n\"Have you forgotten how close I came to going to jail over those\ncharges of yours a year ago?\" he said. \"Have you forgotten the\ndisgrace to me that followed?--the stigma that forced me to disappear\nfor months? You fool, do you think I've forgotten?--or that I'd let\nyou--\"\n\n\"Quade,\" interrupted the older man, \"you know very well you were\nguilty. I caught you red-handed. You didn't fool anyone--except the\njury that let you go. So save your breath, and, if you've the sense\nyou were born with, release my daughter and me. Why, you're crazy!\" he\ncried with mounting anger. \"You can't get away with this! I'll have\nyou in jail within forty-eight hours, once I get back to the surface!\"\n\nWith an effort Quade controlled his feelings and assumed his oily,\nsarcastic manner. \"That's just it,\" he said: \"'once you get back!' How\nstupid you are! You don't seem to realize that you're not going back\nto the surface. You and your daughter.\"\n\nSue gasped, and her father's eyes went wide. There was a tense\nsilence.\n\n\"You wouldn't dare!\" the inventor cried finally. \"You wouldn't dare!\"\n\n\"It's rather large, this cavern,\" Quade went on. \"You'll have plenty\nof room. Perhaps I'll untie you before I go back up, so--\"\n\n\"You can't get away with it!\" shouted the old man, tremendously\nexcited. \"Why, you can't, possibly! Philip Holmes'll track you\ndown--he'll tell the police--he'll rescue us! And then--\"\n\nQuade smiled suavely. \"Oh, no, he won't. Perhaps you remember the shot\nthat sounded from the water-hole? Well, when I and my assistant, Juan,\nheard Holmes say he was going for water, I told Juan to follow him to\nthe water-hole and bind him, to keep him from interfering till I got\nback up. But Mr. Holmes is evidently of an impulsive disposition, and\nmust have caused trouble. Juan, too, is impulsive; he is a Mexican.\nAnd he had a gun. I'm afraid he was forced to use it.... I am quite\nsure Philip Holmes will not, as you say, track me down.\"\n\nDavid Guinness looked at his daughter's white face and horror-filled\neyes and suddenly crumpled. Humbly, passionately, he begged Quade to\ntake her back up. \"Why, she's never done anything to you, Quade!\" he\npleaded. \"You can't take her life like that! Please! Leave me, if you\nmust, but not her! You can't--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut suddenly the old man noticed that Quade was not listening. His\nhead was tilted to one side as if he was straining to hear something\nelse. Guinness was held silent for a moment by the puzzled look on the\nother's face and the strange way he was acting.\n\n\"Do you hear it?\" Quade asked at last; and without waiting for an\nanswer, he knelt down and put his ear to the ground. When he rose his\nface was savage, and he cursed under his breath.\n\n\"Why, it's a humming!\" muttered Professor Guinness. \"And it's getting\nlouder!\"\n\n\"It sounds like another borer!\" ventured Sue.\n\nThe humming grew in volume. Then, from the ceiling, a rock dropped.\nThey were looking at the cavern roof and saw it start, but they did\nnot hear it strike, for the ever-growing humming echoed loudly through\nthe cavern. They saw another rock fall; and another.\n\n\"For God's sake, what is it?\" cried Guinness.\n\nQuade looked at him and slowly drew out his automatic.\n\n\"Another earth-borer, I think,\" he answered. \"And I rather expect it\ncontains your young friend Mr. Holmes. Yes--coming to rescue you.\"\n\nFor a moment Guinness and his daughter were too astounded to do\nanything but gape. She finally exclaimed:\n\n\"But--but then Phil's alive?\"\n\nJames Quade smiled. \"Probably--for the moment. But don't let your\nhopes rise too high. The borer he's in isn't strong enough to survive\na fifty-foot plunge.\" He was shouting now, so loud was the thunder\nfrom above. \"And,\" he added, \"I'm afraid he's not strong enough to\nsurvive it, either!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Man-Hunt_\n\nWhen Phil Holmes started off to the water-hole, his head was full of\nthe earth-borer and the imminent descent. Now that the long-awaited\ntime had come, he was at fever-pitch to be off, and it did not take\nhim long to cover the mile of sandy waste. His thoughts were far\ninside the earth as he dipped the jug into the clear cool water and\nsloshed it full.\n\nSo the rope that snaked softly through the air and dropped in a loop\nover his shoulders came as a stark surprise. Before he knew what was\nhappening it had slithered down over his arms and drawn taut just\nabove the elbows, and he was yanked powerfully backwards and almost\nfell.\n\nBut he managed to keep his feet as he staggered backward, and turning\nhis head he saw the small dark figure of his aggressor some fifteen\nfeet away, keeping tight the slack.\n\nPhil's surprise turned to sudden fury and he completely lost his head.\nWhat he did was rash; mad; and yet, as it turned out, it was the only\nthing that could have saved him. Instinctively, without hesitating\none second, and absolutely ignoring an excited command to stand still,\nhe squirmed face-on to his aggressor, lowered his head and charged.\n\nThe distance was short. Halfway across it, a gun barked, and he heard\nthe bullet crack into the water jug, which he was still holding in\nfront of himself. And even before the splintered fragments reached the\nground he had crashed into the firer.\n\nHe hit him with all the force of a tackling lineman, and they both\nwent down. The man grunted as the wind was jarred out of him, but he\nwriggled like an eel and managed to worm aside and bring up his gun.\n\nThen there was a desperate flurry of bodies in the coarse sand. Holmes\ndived frantically for the gun hand and caught it; but, handicapped as\nhe was by the rope, he could not hold it. Slowly its muzzle bent\nupward to firing position.\n\nDesperately, he wrenched the arm upwards, in the direction it had been\nstraining to go, and the sudden unexpected jerk doubled the man's arm\nand brought the weapon across his chest. For a moment there was a test\nof strength as Phil lay chest to chest over his opponent, the gun\nblocked between. Then the other grunted; squirmed violently--and there\nwas a muffled explosion.\n\nA cry of pain cut the midnight air, and with insane strength Holmes'\nambusher fought free from his grip, staggered to his feet and went\nreeling away. Phil tore loose from the rope and bounded after him,\nnever feeling, at the moment, his powder-burned chest.\n\nAnd then he halted in his tracks.\n\nA great roar came thundering over the desert!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt once he knew that it came from the earth-borer's disintegrators.\nThe sphere had started down without him.\n\nHe stood stock still, petrified with surprise, facing the sound, while\nhis attacker melted farther and farther into the night. And then,\nsuddenly, Phil Holmes was sprinting desperately back towards the\nGuinness camp.\n\nHe ran until he was exhausted; walked for a little while his legs\ngathered more strength, and his laboring lungs more air; and then ran\nagain. As the minutes passed, the thunder lessened rapidly into a\nmuffled drone; and by the time Phil had panted up to the brink of the\nhole that gaped where but a little time before the sphere was\nstanding, it had become but a distant purr. He leaned far over and\npeered into the hot blackness below, but could see nothing.\n\nPhil knelt there silently for some minutes, shocked by his strange\nattack, bewildered by the unexpected descent of the borer. For a time\nhis mind would not work; he had no idea what to do. But gradually his\nthoughts came to order and made certain things clear.\n\nHe had been deliberately ambushed. Only by luck had he escaped, he\ntold himself. If it hadn't been for the water jug, he'd now be out of\nthe picture. And on the heels of the ambush had came the surprising\ndescent of the earth-borer. The two incidents coincided too well: the\nsame mind had planned them. And two, men, at least, were in on the\nplot.... It suddenly became very clear to him that the answer to the\npuzzle lay with the man who had ambushed him. He would have to get\nthat man. Track him down.\n\nPhil acted with decision. He got to his feet and strode rapidly to the\ndeserted Guinness shack, horribly quiet and lonely now in the bright\nmoonlight. In a minute he emerged with a flashlight at his belt and a\nrifle across his arm.\n\nOnce again he went over to the new black hole in the desert and looked\ndown. From far below still came the purr, now fainter than ever. His\nfriend, the girl he loved, were down there, he reflected bitterly, and\nhe was helpless to reach them. Well, there was one thing he could\ndo--go man-hunting. Turning, he started off at a long lope for the\nwater-hole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen minutes later he was there, and off to the side he found the marks\nof their scuffle--and small black blotches that could be nothing but\nblood. The other was wounded: could probably not get far. But he might\nstill have his gun, so Phil kept his rifle handy, and tempered his\nimpatience with caution as he set out on the trail of the widely\nspaced footprints.\n\nThey led off towards the nearby hills, and in the bright moonlight\nPhil did not use his flashlight at all, except to investigate other\nround black blotches that made a line parallel to the prints. As he\nwent on he found his quarry's steps coming more closely together:\nbecoming erratic. Soon they showed as painful drags in the sand, a\nlaborious hauling of one foot after the other.... Phil put away his\nlight and advanced very cautiously.\n\nHe wondered, as he went, who in the devil was behind it all. The\nradium-finding project had been kept strictly secret. Not another soul\nwas supposed to know of the earth-borer and its daring mission into\nthe heart of the earth. Yet, obviously, someone had found out, and\nwhoever it was had laid at least part of his scheme cunningly. An old\nman and a girl cannot offer much resistance: he, Phil, would have been\nwell taken care of had it not been for the water jug. So far, there\nwere at least two in the plot: the man who had ambushed him and the\nunknown who had evidently kidnapped both Professor and Sue Guinness.\nBut there might be still more.\n\nThere might be friends, nearby, of the man he was tracking. The fellow\nmight have reached them, and warned them that the scheme hadn't gone\nthrough, that Phil was loose. They could very easily conceal\nthemselves alongside their partner's tracks and train their rifles on\nthe tracker....\n\nThe trail was leading up into one of the ca\u00f1ons in the cluster of\nhills to the west. For some distance he followed it up through a slash\nof black below the steep moonlit heights of the hills to each\nside--and then, suddenly, he vaguely made out the forms of two huts\njust ahead.\n\nImmediately he stooped low, and went skirting widely off up one side.\nHe proceeded slowly, with great caution, his rifle at the ready. At\nany moment, he knew, the hush might be split by the cracks of\nwaylaying guns. Warily he advanced along the narrow ca\u00f1on wall above\nthe huts. No lights were lit, and the place seemed unoccupied. He was\ndebating what to do next when his attention was attracted to a large\ndark object lying in the ca\u00f1on trail some twenty yards from the\nnearest hut. Straining his eyes in the inadequate moonlight, he saw\nthat it was the outstretched figure of a man. His quarry--his\nambusher!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhil dropped flat, fearful of being seen. Keeping as best he could in\nthe shadows, fearing every moment to hear the sharp bark of a gun, he\ncrawled forward. It took him a long time to approach the sprawled\nfigure, but he wasn't taking chances. When within twenty feet, he rose\nsuddenly and darted forward to the man's side.\n\nHis rapid glance showed him that the fellow was completely out: and\nanother quick look around failed to show that anyone else was\nwatching, so he returned to his examination of the man. It was the\nambusher, all right: a Mexican. He was still breathing, though his\nface was drawn and white from the loss of blood from a wound under the\nblood-soaked clothing near his upper right arm. A hasty search showed\nthat he no longer had his gun, so Phil, satisfied that he was\npowerless for some time to come, cautiously wormed his way towards the\ntwo shacks.\n\nThere was something sinister in the strange silence that hung over\nthem. One was of queer construction--a windowless, square, high box\nof galvanized iron. The other was obviously a dwelling place.\nCarefully Phil sneaked up to the latter. Then, rifle ready, he pushed\nits door open and sent a beam of light stabbing through the darkness\nof the interior.\n\nThere was no one there. Only two bunks, a table, chair, a pail of\nwater and some cooking utensils met his view. He crept out toward the\nother building.\n\nCome close, Phil found that a dun-colored canvas had been thrown over\nthe top of it, making an adequate camouflage in daytime. The place was\nabout twenty feet high. He prowled around the metal walls and\ndiscovered a rickety door. Again, gun ready, he flung it open. The\nbeam from his flash speared a path through the blackness--and he\ngasped at sight of what stood revealed.\n\nThere, inside, was a long, bullet-like tube of metal, the pointed end\nupper-most, and the bottom, which was flat, toward the ground. It was\nheld in a wooden cradle, and was slanted at the floor. In the bottom\nwere holes of two shapes--rocket tubes and disintegrating projectors.\nIt was another earth-borer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhil stood frozen with surprise before this totally unlooked-for\nmachine. He could easily have been overcome, had the owner been in the\nbuilding, for he had forgotten everything but what his eyes were\nstaring at. He started slowly around the borer, found a long narrow\ndoor slightly ajar, and stepped inside.\n\nThis borer, like Guinness's, had a double shell, and much the same\ninstruments, though the whole job was simpler and cruder. A small\ninstrument board contained inclination, temperature, depth and\nair-purity indicators, and narrow tubes led to the air rectifiers. But\nwhat kept Holmes' attention were the wires running from the magneto to\nthe mixing chambers of the disintegrating tubes.\n\n\"The fools!\" he exclaimed, \"--they didn't know how to wire the thing!\nOr else,\" he added after a moment, \"didn't get around to doing it.\" He\nnoticed that the projectile's interior contained no gyroscope: though,\nhe thought, none would be needed, for the machine, being long and\nnarrow, could not change keel while in the ground. Here he was\nreminded of something. Stepping outside, he estimated the angle the\nborer made with the dirt floor. Twenty degrees. \"And pointed\nsouthwest!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"This borer would come close to\nmeeting the professor's, four miles under our camp!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt once he knew what he would do. First he went back to the other\nshack and got the pail of water he had noticed, and took this out\nwhere the Mexican lay outstretched. He bathed the man's face and the\nstill slightly bleeding bullet wound in his shoulder.\n\nPresently the wounded man came to. His eyes opened, and he stared up\ninto a steel mask of a face, in which two level black eyes bored into\nhis. He remembered that face--remembered it all too well. He trembled,\ncowered away.\n\n\"No!\" he gasped, as if he had seen a ghost. \"No--no!\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm the man,\" Holmes told him firmly, menacingly. \"The same one\nyou tried to ambush.\" He paused a moment, then said: \"Do you want to\nlive?\"\n\nIt was a simple question, frightening in its simplicity.\n\n\"Because if you don't answer my questions, I'm going to let you lie\nhere,\" Phil went on coldly. \"And that would probably mean your death.\nIf you do answer, I'll fix you up so you can have a chance.\"\n\nThe Mexican nodded eagerly. \"I talk,\" he said.\n\n\"Good,\" said Phil. \"Then tell me who built that machine?\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1or Quade. Se\u00f1or James Quade.\"\n\n\"Quade!\" Phil had heard the name before. \"Of course!\" he said.\n\"Guinness's old partner!\"\n\n\"I not know,\" the Mexican answered. \"He hire me with much money. He\nbuy thees machine inside, and we put him together. But he could no\nmake him work--it take too long. We watch, hear old man go down\nto-night, and--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe greaser stopped. \"And so he sent you to get me, while he kidnapped\nthe old man and his daughter and forced them under the ground in their\nown borer,\" Holmes supplied, and the other nodded.\n\n\"But I only mean to tie you!\" he blurted, gesturing weakly. \"I no mean\nshoot! No, no--\"\n\n\"All right--forget it,\" Phil interrupted. \"And now tell me what Quade\nexpects to do down there.\"\n\n\"I not know, Se\u00f1or,\" came the hesitant reply, \"but....\"\n\n\"But what?\" the young man jerked.\n\nReluctantly the wounded Mexican continued. \"Se\u00f1or Quade--he--I think\nhe don' like thees old man. I think he leave heem an' the girl down\nbelow. Then he come up an' say they keeled going down.\"\n\nPhil nodded grimly. \"I see,\" he said, voicing his thoughts. \"Then he\nwould say that he and Professor Guinness are still partners--and the\nradium ore will belong to him. Very nice. Very nice....\"\n\nHe snapped back to action, and without another word hoisted the\nMexican onto his back and carried him into the shack. There he\ncleansed the wound, rigged up a tight bandage for it, and tied the man\nto one of the cots. He tied him in such a fashion that he could reach\nsome food and water he put by the cot.\n\n\"You leave me like thees?\" the Mexican asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Phil said, and started for the door.\n\n\"But what you going to do?\"\n\nPhil smiled grimly as he flung an answer back over his shoulder.\n\n\"Me?--I'm going to fix the wiring on those disintegrators in your\nfriend Quade's borer. Then I'm starting down after him.\" He stopped\nand turned before he closed the door. \"And if I don't get back--well,\nit's just too bad for you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so, a little later, once more the hushed desert night was cleft by\na furious bellow of sound. It came, this time, from a narrow ca\u00f1on.\nThe steep sides threw the roar back and back again, and the echoes\nswelled to an earth-shaking blast of sound. The oblong hut from which\nit came rocked and almost fell; then, as the noise began to lessen,\nteetered on its foundations and half-slipped into the ragged hole that\nhad been bored inside.\n\nThe descent was a nightmare that Holmes would never forget. Quade's\nmachine was much cruder and less efficient than the sphere David\nGuinness had designed. Its protecting insulation proved quite\ninadequate, and the heat rapidly grew terrific as the borer dug down.\nPhil became faint, stifled, and his body oozed streams of sweat. And\nthe descent was also bumpy and uneven; often he was forced to leave\nthe controls and work on the mechanism of the disintegrators when they\nfaltered and threatened to stop. But in spite of everything the needle\non the depth gauge gradually swung over to three thousand, and four,\nand five....\n\nAfter the first mile Holmes improvised a way to change the air more\nrapidly, and it grew a little cooler. He watched the story the depth\ngauge told with narrowed eyes, and, as it reached three miles,\ninspected his rifle. At three and a half miles he stopped the borer,\nthinking to try to hear the noise made by the other, but so paralyzed\nwere his ear-drums from the terrific thunder beneath, it seemed hardly\nany quieter when it ceased.\n\nHis plans were vague; they would have to be made according to the\nconditions he found. There was a coil of rope in the tube-like\ninterior of the borer, and he hoped to find a cavern or cleft in the\nearth for lateral exploring. He would stop at a depth of four\nmiles--where he should be very near the path of the professor's\nsphere.\n\nBut Phil never saw the needle on the gauge rise to four miles. At\nthree and three quarters came sudden catastrophe.\n\nHe knew only that there was an awful moment of utter helplessness,\nwhen the borer swooped wildly downwards, and the floor was snatched\nsickeningly from under him. He was thrown violently against the\ninstrument panel; then up toward the pointed top; and at the same\ninstant came a rending crash that drove his senses from him....\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\"_You Haven't the Guts_\"\n\n\"Just as I thought,\" said James Quade in the silence that fell when\nthe last echoes had died away, and the splinters of steel and rock had\nsettled. \"You see, Professor, this earth-borer belongs to me. Yes, I\nbuilt one too. But I couldn't, unfortunately, get it working\nproperly--that is, in time to get down here first. After all, I'm not\na scientist, and remembered little enough of your borer's plans....\nIt's probably young Holmes who's dropped in on us. Shall we see?\"\n\nDavid Guinness and his daughter were speechless with dread. Quade had\ntrained the searchlight on the borer, and by turning their heads they\ncould see it plainly. It was all too clear that the machine was a\ntotal wreck. It had pitched over onto one side, its shell cracked and\nmangled irreparably. Grotesque pieces of crumpled metal lay all around\nit. Its slanting course had tumbled it within fifteen yards of the\nsphere.\n\nIn silence the old man and the girl watched Quade walk deliberately\nover to it, his automatic steady in his right hand. He wrenched at the\nlong, narrow door, but it was so badly bent that for a while he could\nnot get it open. At last it swung out, however, and Quade peered\ninside.\n\nAfter a moment he reached in and drew out a rifle. He took it over to\na nearby rock, smashed the gun's breech, then flung it, useless,\naside. Returning to the borer, he again peered in.\n\nSue was about to scream from the torturous suspense when he at last\nstraightened up and looked around at the white-faced girl and her\nfather.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes is tougher than I'd thought possible,\" he said, with a\nthin smile; \"he's still alive.\" And, as Sue gasped with relief, he\nadded: \"Would you like to see him?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe dragged the young man's unconscious body roughly out on the floor.\nThere were several bad bruises on his face and head, but otherwise he\nwas apparently uninjured. As Quade stood over him, playing idly with\nthe automatic, he stirred, and blinked, and at last, with an effort,\ngot up on one elbow and looked straight at the thin lips and narrowed\neyes of the man standing above. He shook his head, trying to\ncomprehend, then muttered hazily:\n\n\"You--you're--Quade?\"\n\nQuade did not have time to answer, for Sue Guinness cried out:\n\n\"Phil! Are you all right?\"\n\nPhil stared stupidly around, caught sight of the two who lay bound on\nthe floor, and staggered to his feet. \"Sue!\" he cried, relief and\nunderstanding flooding his voice. He started towards her.\n\n\"Stand where you are!\" Quade snapped harshly, and the automatic in his\nhand came up. Holmes peered at it and stopped, but his blood-streaked\nface settled into tight lines, and his body tensed.\n\n\"You'd better,\" continued Quade. \"Now tell me what happened to Juan.\"\n\nPhil forced himself to be calm. \"Your pal, the greaser?\" he said\ncuttingly. \"He's lying on a bunk in your shack. He shot himself,\nplaying with a gun.\"\n\nQuade chose not to notice the way Phil said this, but a little of the\nsuave self-confidence was gone from his face as he said: \"Well, in\nthat case I'll have to hurry back to the surface to attend to him. But\ndon't be alarmed,\" he added, more brightly. \"I'll be back for you all\nin an hour or so.\"\n\nAt this, David Guinness struggled frantically with his bonds and\nyelled:\n\n\"Don't believe him, Phil! He's going to leave us here, to starve and\ndie! He told us so just before you came down!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuade's face twitched perceptibly. His eyes were nervous.\n\n\"Is that true, Quade?\" Holmes asked. There was a steely note in his\nvoice.\n\n\"Why--no, of course not,\" the other said hastily, uncertain whether to\nlie or not. \"Of course I didn't!\"\n\nPhil Holmes looked square into his eyes. He bluffed.\n\n\"You couldn't desert us, Quade. You haven't the guts. You haven't the\nguts.\"\n\nHis face and eyes burned with the contempt that was in his words. It\ncut Quade to the raw. But he could not avoid Phil's eyes. He stared at\nthem for a full moment, trembling slightly. Slowly, by inches, he\nstarted to back toward the sphere; then suddenly he ran for it with\nall his might, Holmes after him. Quade got to it first, and inside, as\nhe yanked in the searchlight and slammed and locked the door, he\nyelled:\n\n\"You'll see, you damned pup! You'll see!\" And there was the smothered\nsound of half-maniacal laughter....\n\nPhil threw all his weight against the metal door, but it was hopeless\nand he knew it. He had gathered himself for another rush when he heard\nGuinness yell:\n\n\"Back, Phil--back! He'll turn on the side disintegrators!\"\n\nMad with rage as the young man was, he at once saw the danger and\nleaped away--only to almost fall over the professor's prone body. With\nhurrying, trembling fingers he untied the pair's bonds, and they\nstruggled to their feet, cramped and stiff. Then it was Phil who\nwarned them.\n\n\"Back as far as you can! Hurry!\" He grabbed Sue's hand and plunged\ntoward the uncertain protection of a huge rock far in the rear. At\nonce he made them lie flat on the ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs yet the sphere had not stirred nor emitted a whisper of sound,\nthough they knew the man inside was conning the controls in a fever of\nhaste to leave the cavern. But they hadn't long to wait. There came a\nsputter, a starting cough from the rocket tubes beneath the sphere.\nQuickly they warmed into life, and the dully glimmering ball rocked in\nthe hole it lay in. Then a cataract of noise unleashed itself; a\ndevastating thunder roared through the echoing cavern as the rockets\nburst into full force. A wave of brilliant orange-red splashed out\nfrom under the sphere, licked back up its sides, and seemed literally\nto shove the great ball up towards the hole in the ceiling.\n\nIts ascent was very slow. As it gained height it looked--save for its\nspeed--like a fantastic meteor flaming through the night, for the\norange plumage that streamed from beneath lit the ball with dazzling\ncolor. A glowing sphere, it staggered midway between floor and\nceiling, creeping jerkily upwards.\n\n\"He's not going to hit the hole!\" shouted Guinness.\n\nThe borer had not risen in a perfectly straight line; it jarred\nagainst the rim of the hole, and wavered uncertainly. Every second the\nroar of its rockets, swollen by echoes, rose in a savage crescendo;\nthe faces of the three who watched were painted orange in the glow.\n\nThe sphere was blind. The man inside could judge his course only by\nthe feel. As the three who were deserted watched, hoping ardently that\nQuade would not be able to find the opening, the left side-rockets\nspouted lances of fire, and they knew he had discovered the way to\nmaneuver the borer laterally. The new flames welded with the exhaust\nof the main tubes into a great fan-shaped tail, so brilliant and shot\nthrough with other colors that their eyes could not stand the sight,\nexcept in winks. The borer jerked to the right, but still it could not\nfind the hole. Then the flames lessened for a moment, and the borer\nsank down, to rise again a moment later. Its ascent was so labored\nthat Phil shouted to Professor Guinness:\n\n\"Why so slow?\"\n\nAnd the inventor told him that which he had not seen for the\nintolerable light.\n\n\"Only half his rockets are on!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time the sphere was correctly aimed, however, and it roared\nstraight into the hole. Immediately the fierce sound of the exhaust\nwas muffled, and in a few seconds only the fiery plumage, shooting\ndown from the ceiling, showed where the machine was. Then this\ndisappeared, and the noise alone was left.\n\nPhil leaped forward, intending to stare up, but Guinness's yell halted\nhim.\n\n\"Not yet! He might still use the disintegrators!\"\n\nFor many minutes they waited, till the muffled exhaust had died to a\ndrone. There was a puzzled expression on the professor's face as the\nthree at last walked over and dared peer up into the hole. Far above,\nthe splash of orange lit the walls of the tunnel.\n\n\"That's funny!\" the old man muttered. \"He's only using half the\nrockets--about ten. I thought he'd turn them all on when he got into\nthe hole, but he didn't. Either they were damaged in the fall, or\nQuade doesn't see fit to use them.\"\n\n\"Half of them are enough,\" said Phil bitterly, and put his arm around\nthe quiet girl standing next to him. Together, a silent little group,\nthey watched the spot of orange die to a pin-point; watched it waver,\ntwinkle, ever growing smaller.... And then it was gone.\n\nGone! Back to the surface of the earth, to the normal world of\nreality. Only four miles above them--a small enough distance on the\nsurface itself--and yet it might have been a million miles, so utterly\nwere they barred from it....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe same thought was in their minds, though none of them dared express\nit. They were thinking of the serene desert, and the cool wind, and\nthe buttes and the high hills, placid in the moonlight. Of the hushed\nrise of the dawn, the first flush of the sun that was so achingly\nlovely on the desert. The sun they would never see again, buried in a\nlifeless world of gloom four miles within.... And buried alive--and\nnot alive for long....\n\nBut that way lay madness. Phil Holmes drove the horrible thoughts from\nhis brain and forced a smile to his face.\n\n\"Well, that's that!\" he said in a voice meant to be cheerful.\n\nThe dim cavern echoed his words mockingly. With the earth-borer\ngone--the man-made machine that had dared break a solitude undisturbed\nsince the earth first cooled--the great cavern seemed to return to its\nawful original mood. The three dwarfed humans became wholly conscious\nof it. They felt it almost a living thing, stretching vastly around\nthem, tightening its unheard spell on them. Its smell, of mouldy earth\nand rocks down which water slowly dripped, filled their nostrils and\nsomehow added to their fear.\n\nAs they looked about, their eyes became accustomed to the dim, eery,\nphosphorescent illumination. They saw little worm-like creatures now\nand again appear from tiny holes between stalagmites in the jagged\nfloor; and, as Phil wondered in his mind how long it would be before\nthey would be reduced to using them for food, a strange mole-sized\nanimal scraped from the darkness and pecked at one of them. As it\nslithered away, a writhing shape in its mouth, Holmes muttered\nbitterly: \"A competitor!\" Vague, flitting forms haunted the gloom\namong the stalactites of the distorted ceiling--hints of the things\nthat lived in the terrible silence of this nether world. Here Time had\npaused, and life had halted in primate form.\n\nA little moan came from Sue Guinness's pale lips. She plucked at her\narm; a sickly white worm, only an inch long, had fallen on it from the\nceiling. \"Oh!\" she gasped. \"Oh!\"\n\nPhil drew her closer to him, and walked with her over to Quade's\nwrecked borer. \"Let's see what we've got here,\" he suggested\ncheerfully.\n\nThe machine was over on its side, the metal mangled and crushed beyond\nrepair. Nevertheless, he squeezed into it. \"Stand back!\" he warned.\n\"I'm going to try its rockets!\" There was a click of broken machinery,\nand that was all. \"Rockets gone,\" Phil muttered.\n\nHe pulled another lever over. There was a sputter from within the\nborer, then a furious roar that sent great echoes beating through the\ncavern. A cloud of dust reared up before the bottom of the machine,\nwhipped madly for a moment, and sank as the bellow of sound died down.\nSue saw that a rocky rise in the floor directly in front of the\ndisintegrators had been planed off levelly.\n\nPhil scrambled out. \"The disintegrators work,\" he said, \"but a lot of\ngood they do us. The borer's hopelessly cracked.\" He shrugged his\nshoulders, and with a discouraged gesture cast to the ground a coil of\nrope he had found inside.\n\nThen suddenly he swung around. \"Professor!\" he called to the old\nfigure standing bowed beneath the hole in the ceiling. \"There's a\ndraft blowing from somewhere! Do you feel it?\"\n\nGuinness felt with his hands a moment and nodded slowly. \"Yes,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"It's coming from this way!\" Sue said excitedly, pointing into the\ndarkness on one side of the cavern. \"And it goes up the hole we made\nin the ceiling!\"\n\nPhil turned eagerly to the old inventor. \"It must come from\nsomewhere,\" he said, \"and that somewhere may take us toward the\nsurface. Let's follow it!\"\n\n\"We might as well,\" the other agreed wearily. His was the tone of a\nman who has only a certain time to live.\n\nBut Phil was more eager. \"While there's life, there's hope,\" he said\ncheerfully. \"Come on, Sue, Professor!\" And he led the way forward\ntoward the dim, distorted rock shapes in the distance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe roof and sides of the cavern angled down into a rough, tunnel-like\nopening, from which the draft swept. It was a heavy air, weighted with\nthe smell of moist earth and lifeless water and a nameless, flat,\nstale gas. They slowly made their way through the impeding\nstalagmites, surrounded by a dark blur of shadows, the ghostly\nphosphorescent light illuminating well only the few rods around them.\nUtter silence brooded over the tunnel.\n\nPhil paused when they had gone about seventy-five feet. \"I left that\nrope behind,\" he said, \"and we may need it. I'll return and get it,\nand you both wait right here.\" With the words he turned and went back\ninto the shadows.\n\nHe went as fast as he could, not liking to leave the other two alone.\nBut when he had retrieved the rope and tied it to his waist, he\npermitted himself a last look up as he passed under the hole in the\nceiling--and what he saw there tensed every muscle in his body, and\nmade his heart beat like mad. Again there was a tiny spot of orange in\nthe blackness above!\n\n\"Professor!\" he yelled excitedly. \"Sue! Come here! The sphere's\ncoming back!\"\n\nThere was no doubt about it. The pin-point of light was growing each\nsecond, with the flame of the descending exhausts. Guinness and his\ndaughter ran from the tunnel, and, guided by Phil's excited\nejaculations, hurried to his side. Their eyes confirmed what his had\nseen. The earth-borer was coming down!\n\n\"But,\" Guinness said bewilderedly, \"those rockets were enough to lift\nhim!\"\n\nThis was a mystery. Even though ten rockets were on--ten tiny spots of\norange flame--the sphere came down swiftly. The same force which some\ntime before had lifted it slowly up was now insufficient. The roar of\nthe tubes rose rapidly. \"Get back!\" Phil ordered, remembering the\ndanger, and they all retreated to the mouth of the tunnel, ready to\npeep cautiously around the edge. Holmes' jaws were locked tight with\ngrim resolution. Quade was coming back! he told himself exultantly.\nThis time he must not go up alone! This time--!\n\nBut his half-formed resolutions were idle. He could not know what\nfrightful thing was bringing Quade down--what frightful experience was\nin store for them all....\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Spawn of the Cavern_\n\nIn a crescendo of noise that stunned their ears, the earth-borer came\ndown. Tongues of fire flared from the hole, speared to the ground and\nwere deflected upward, cradling the metal ball in a wave of flame.\nThrough this fiery curtain the machine slowly lowered to the floor,\nwhere a shower of sparks spattered out, blinding the eyes of the\nwatchers with their brilliance. For a full minute the orange-glowing\nsphere lay there, quivering from the vibration; then the exhausts died\nand the wave of flame wavered and sank into nothingness. While their\near-drums continued the thunder, the three stared at the borer, not\ndaring to approach, yet striving to solve the mystery of why it had\nsunk despite the up-thrust of ten rocket tubes.\n\nAs their eyes again became accustomed to the familiar phosphorescent\nillumination, pallid and cold after the fierce orange flame, they saw\nwhy--and their eyes went wide with surprise and horror.\n\nA strange mass was covering the top of the earth-borer--something that\nlooked like a heap of viscid, whitish jelly. It was sprawled\nshapelessly over the round upper part of the metal sphere, a\nhalf-transparent, loathsome stuff, several feet thick in places.\n\nAnd Phil Holmes, striving to understand what it could be, saw an awful\nthing. \"It's moving!\" he whispered, unconsciously drawing Sue closer.\n\"There's--there's life in it!\"\n\nLazy quiverings were running through the mound of jelly, pulsings that\ngave evidence of its low organism. They saw little ripples of even\nbeat run over it, and under them steady, sluggish convulsions that\ntold of life; that showed, perhaps, that the thing was hungry and\npreparing to move its body in quest of food.\n\nIt was alive, unquestionably. The borer lay still, but this thing\nmoved internally, of itself. It was life in its lowest, most primate\nform. The mass was mind, stomach, muscle and body all in one, stark\nand raw before their startled eyes.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" Phil whispered through the long pause. \"It can't be\nreal!...\"\n\n\"Protoplasm--a monster amoeba,\" David Guinness's curiously cracked\nvoice said. \"Just as it exists on the surface, only microscopically.\nPrimate life....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lock of the earth-borer clicked. Phil gasped. \"Quade is coming\nout!\" he said. A little cry of horror came from Sue. And the metal\ndoor opened.\n\nJames Quade stepped through, automatic in hand. He was fresh from the\nlight inside, and he could not see well. He was quite unconscious of\nwhat was oozing down on him from above, of the flabby heap that was\ncarefully stretching down for him. He peered into the gloom, looking\nfor the three he had deserted, and all the time an arm from the mass\nabove crept nearer. Sue Guinness's nerves suddenly gave, and she\nshrieked; but Quade's ears were deaf from the borer's thunder, and he\ndid not hear her.\n\nIt was when he lifted one foot back into the sphere--probably to get\nout the searchlight--that he felt the thing's presence. He looked\nup--and a strange sound came from him. For seconds he apparently could\nnot move, stark fear rooting him to the ground, the gun limp in his\nhand.\n\nThen a surge ran through the mound of flesh, and the arm, a pseudopod,\nreached more rapidly for him.\n\nIt stung Quade into action. He leaped back, brought up his automatic,\nand fired at the thing once; then three times more. He, and each one\nof the others, saw four bullets thud into the heap of pallid matter\nand heard them clang on the metal of the sphere beneath. They had gone\nright through its flesh--but they showed no slightest effect!\n\nQuade was evidently unwilling to leave the sphere. Jerking his arm up\nhe brought his trigger finger back again. A burst of three more shots\nbarked through the cavern, echoing and re-echoing. The man screamed an\ninarticulate oath as he saw how useless his bullets were, and hurled\nthe empty gun at the monster--which was down on the floor now, and\nbunching its sluggish body together.\n\nThe automatic went right into it. They could all see it there, in the\nmiddle of the amorphous body, while the creature stopped, as if\ndetermining whether or not it was food. Quade screwed his courage\ntogether in the pause, and tried to dodge past to the door of the\nsphere; but the monster was alert: another pseudopod sprang out from\nits shapeless flesh, sending him back on his heels.\n\nThe feeler had all but touched Quade, and with the closeness of his\nescape, the remnants of his courage gave. He yelled, and turned and\nran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe ran straight for the three who watched from the tunnel mouth, and\nthe mound of shapeless jelly came fast on his trail. It came in\nsurging rolls, like thick fluid oozing forward; it would have been\nhard to measure its size, for each moment it changed. The only\nimpression the four humans had was that of a wave of half-transparent\nmatter that one instant was a sticky ball of viscid flesh and the next\na rapidly advancing crescent whose horns reached far out on each flank\nto cut off retreat.\n\nBy instinct Phil jerked Sue around and yelled at the professor to run,\nfor the old man seemed to be frozen into an attitude of fearful\ninterest. Bullets would not stop the thing--could anything? Holmes\nwondered. He could visualize all too easily the death they would meet\nif that shapeless, naked protoplasmic mass overtook and flowed over\nthem....\n\nBut he wasted no time with such thoughts. They ran, all three, into\nthe dark tunnel.\n\nQuade caught up with them quickly. Personal enmity was suspended\nbefore this common peril. They could not run at full speed, for a\nmultitude of obstacles hindered them. Tortuous ridges of rock lay\ndirectly across their path, formations that had been whipped in some\nmad, eon-old convulsion and then, through the ages, remained frozen\ninto their present distortion; black pits gaped suddenly before them;\nhalf-seen stalagmites, whose crystalline edges were razor-sharp, tore\nthrough to their flesh. Haste was perilous where every moment they\nmight stumble into an unseen cleft and go pitching into awful depths\nbelow. They were staking everything on the draft that blew steadily\nin their faces; Phil told himself desperately that it must lead to\nsome opening--it must!\n\nBut what if the opening were a vertical, impassable tunnel? He would\nnot think of that....\n\nOld David Guinness tired fast, and was already lagging in the rear\nwhen Quade gasped hoarsely:\n\n\"Hurry! It's close behind!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSurging rapidly at a constant distance behind them, it came on. It was\nas fast as they were, and evidently untiring. It was in its own\nelement; obstacles meant nothing to it. It oozed over the jagged\nridges that took the humans precious moments to scramble past, and the\nspeed of its weird progress seemed to increase as theirs faltered. It\nwas a heartless mass driven inexorably by primal instinct towards the\nfood that lay ahead. The dim phosphorescent illumination tinged its\nflabby tissues a weird white.\n\nThe passage they stumbled through narrowed. Long irregular spears of\nstalactites hung from the unseen ceiling; others, the drippings of\nages, pronged up from the floor, shredding their clothes as they\njarred into them. One moment they were clambering up-hill, slipping on\nthe damp rock; the next they were sliding down into unprobed darkness,\nreckless of where they would land. They were aware only that the\nwater-odorous draft was still in their faces, and the hungry mound of\nflesh behind....\n\n\"I can't last much longer!\" old Guinness's winded voice gasped. \"Best\nleave me behind. I--I might delay it!\"\n\nFor answer, Phil went back, grabbed him by the arm and dragged his\ntired body forward. He was snatching a glance behind to see how close\nthe monster was, when Sue's frightened voice reached him from ahead.\n\n\"There's a wall here, Phil--and no way through!\"\n\nAnd then Holmes came to it. It barred the passage, and was apparently\nunbroken. Yet the draft still came!\n\n\"Search for where the draft enters!\" he yelled. \"You take that side!\"\nAnd he started feeling over the clammy, uneven surface, searching\nfrantically for a cleft. It seemed to be hopeless. Quade stood staring\nback into the gloom, his eyes looking for what he knew was surging\ntowards them. His face had gone sickly white, he was trembling as if\nwith fever, and he sucked in air with long, racking gasps.\n\n\"Here! I have it!\" cried the girl suddenly at her end of the wall. The\nother three ran over, and saw, just above her head, a narrow rift in\nthe rock, barely wide enough to squirm through. \"Into it!\" Phil\nordered tersely. He grasped her, raised her high, and she wormed\nthrough. Quade scrambled to get in next, but Holmes shoved him aside\nand boosted the old man through. Then he helped the other.\n\nA second after he had swung himself up, a wave of whitish matter\nrolled up below, hungry pseudopods reaching for the food it knew was\nnear. It began to trickle up the wall....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe crack was narrow and jagged; utterly black. Phil could hear Quade\nfrantically worming himself ahead, and he wondered achingly if it\nwould lead anywhere. Then a faint, clear voice from ahead rang out:\n\n\"It's opening up!\"\n\nSue's voice! Phil breathed more easily. The next moment Quade\nscrambled through; dim light came; and they were in another vast,\nghostly-lit cavern.\n\nThe crack came out on its floor-level; Guinness was resting near, and\nhis daughter had her hands on a large boulder of rock. \"Let's shove it\nagainst the hole!\" she suggested to Phil. \"It might stop it!\"\n\n\"Good, Sue, good!\" he exclaimed, and at once all four of them strained\nat the chunk, putting forth every bit of strength they had. The\nboulder stirred, rolled over, and thudded neatly in front of the\ncrack, almost completely sealing it. There was only a cleft of five\ninches on one side.\n\nBut their expression of relief died in their throats. A tiny trickle\nof white appeared through the niche. The amorphous monster was\ncompressing itself to a single stream, thin enough to squeeze through\neven that narrow space.\n\nThey could not block it. They had nothing to attack it with. There was\nnothing to do but run.... And hope for a chance to double back....\n\nAs nearly as they could make out, this second cavern was as large as\nthe first. They could dimly see the fantastic shapes of hundreds of\nstalactites hanging from the ceiling. Clumps of stalagmites made the\nfloor a maze which they threaded painfully. The strong steady draft\nguided them like a radio beacon, leading them to their only faint hope\nof escape and life. Guinness, very tired, staggered along\nmechanically, a heavy weight on Phil's supporting arm; James Quade ran\nhere and there in frantic spurts of speed. Sue was silent, but the\nhopelessness in her eyes tortured Phil like a wound. His shirt had\nlong since been ripped to shreds; his face, bruised in the first place\nby the borer he had crashed in, now was scratched and bloody from\ncontact with rough stalagmites.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, without warning, they suddenly found among the rough walls on\nthe far side of the cavern, the birthplace of the draft. It lay at the\nedge of the floor--a dark hole, very wide. Black, sinister and clammy\nfrom the draft that poured from it, it pierced vertically down into\nthe very bowels of the earth. It was impassable.\n\nJames Quade crumpled at the brink; \"It's the end!\" he moaned. \"We\ncan't go farther! It's the end of the draft!\"\n\nThe hole blocked their forward path completely. They could not go\nahead.... In seconds, it seemed, the slithering that told of the\nmonster's approach sounded from behind. Sue's eyes were already fixed\non the awful, surging mass when a voice off to one side yelled:\n\n\"Here! Quick!\"\n\nIt was Phil Holmes. He had been scouting through the gloom, and had\nfound something.\n\nThe other three ran to him. \"There's another draft going through\nhere,\" he explained rapidly, pointing to an angled crevice in the\nrocky wall. \"There's a good chance it goes to the cavern where the\nsphere and the hole to the surface are. Anyway, we've got to take it.\nI'd better go first, after this--and you, Quade, last. I trust you\nless than the monster behind.\"\n\nHe turned and edged into the crack, and the others followed as he had\nordered. Quickly the passageway broadened, and they found the going\nmuch easier than it had been before. For perhaps ten minutes they\nscrambled along, with the draft always on their backs and the blessed,\nthough faint, fire of hope kindling again. In all that time they did\nnot see their pursuer once, and the hope that they had lost it brought\na measure of much needed optimism to drive their tired bodies onward.\nThey found but few time-wasting obstacles. If only the tunnel would\ncontinue right into the original cavern! If only their path would stay\nclear and unhindered!\n\nBut it did not. The sound of Phil's footsteps ahead stopped, and when\nSue and her father came up they saw why.\n\n\"A river!\" Phil said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were standing on a narrow ledge that overhung an underground\nriver. A fetid smell of age-old, lifeless water rose from it. Dimly,\nat least fifty feet across, they could see the other side, shrouded in\nvague shadows. The inky stream beneath did not seem to move at all,\nbut remained smooth and hard and thick-looking.\n\nThey could not go around it. The ledge was only a few feet wide, and\nblocked at each side.\n\n\"Got to cross!\" Phil said tersely.\n\nQuade, sickly-faced, stared down. \"There--there might be other things\nin that water!\" he gasped. \"Monsters!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" agreed Phil contemptuously. \"You'd better stay here.\" He\nturned to the others. \"I'll see how deep it is,\" he said, and without\nthe faintest hesitation dove flatly in.\n\nOily ripples washed back, and they saw his head poke through,\nsputtering. \"Not deep,\" he said. \"Chest-high. Come on.\"\n\nHe reached for Sue, helped her down, and did the same for her father.\nHolding each by the hand, Sue's head barely above the water, he\nstarted across. They had not gone more than twenty feet when they\nheard Quade, left on the bank, give a hoarse yell of fear and dive\ninto the water. Their dread pursuer had caught up with them.\n\nAnd it followed--on the water! Phil had hoped it would not be able to\ncross, but once more the thing's astounding adaptability dashed his\nhopes. Without hesitation, the whitish jelly sprawled out over the\nwater, rolling after them with ghastly, snake-like ripples, its pallid\nbody standing out gruesomely against the black, odorous tide.\n\nQuade came up thrashing madly, some feet to the side of the other\nthree. He was swimming--and swimming with such strength that he\nquickly left them behind. He would be across before they; and that\nmeant there was a good chance that the earth-borer would go up again\nwith only one passenger....\n\nPhil fought against the water, pulling Sue and her father forward as\nbest he could. From behind came the rippling sound of their shapeless\npursuer. \"Ten feet more--\" Holmes began--then abruptly stopped.\n\nThere had been a swish, a ripple upstream. And as their heads turned\nthey saw the water part and a black head, long, evil, glistening,\npointing coldly down to where they were struggling towards the shore.\nPhil Holmes felt his strength ooze out. He heard Professor Guinness\ngasp:\n\n\"A water-snake!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIts head was reared above the surface, gliding down on them silently,\nleaving a wedge of long, sluggish ripples behind. When thirty feet\naway the glistening head dipped under, and a great half-circle of\nleg-thick body arched out. It was like an oily stream of curved cable;\nthen it ended in a pointed tail--and the creature was entirely under\nwater....\n\nWith desperate strength Phil hauled the girl to the bank and, standing\nin several feet of water, pushed her up. Then he whirled and yanked\nold Guinness past him up into the hands of his daughter. With them\nsafe, and Sue reaching out her hand for him, he began to scramble up\nhimself.\n\nBut he was too late. There was a swish in the water behind him, and\ntoothless, hard-gummed jaws clamped tight over one leg and drew him\nback and under. And with the touch of the creature's mouth a stiff\nshock jolted him; his body went numb; his arms flopped limply down. He\nwas paralyzed.\n\nSue Guinness cried out. Her father stared helplessly at the spot where\nhis young partner had disappeared with so little commotion.\n\n\"It was an eel,\" he muttered dully. \"Some kind of electric eel....\"\n\nPhil dimly realized the same thing. A moment later his face broke the\nsurface, but he could not cry out; he could not move his little\nfinger. Only his involuntary muscles kept working--his heart and his\nlungs. He found he could control his breathing a little.... And then\nhe was wondering why he was remaining motionless on the surface.\nGradually he came to understand.\n\nHe had not felt it, but the eel had let go its hold on his leg, and\nhad disappeared. But only for a moment. Suddenly, from somewhere near,\nits gleaming body writhed crazily, and a terrific twist of its tail\nhit Phil a glancing blow on the chest. He was swept under, and the\nwater around him became a maelstrom. When next he bobbed to the\ntumultuous surface, he managed to get a much-needed breath of\nair--and in the swirling currents glimpsed the long, snake-like head\nof the eel go shooting by, with thin trickles of stuff that looked\nlike white jelly clinging to it.\n\nThat explained what was happening. The eel had been challenged by the\nameboid monster, and they were fighting for possession of him--the\ncommon prey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe water became an inferno of whipping and lashing movements, of\nwhitish fibers and spearing thrusts of a glistening black electric\nbody. Unquestionably the eel was using its numbing electric shock on\nits foe. Time and time again Phil felt the amoeba grasp him,\nsearingly, only to be wrenched free by the force of the currents the\ncombat stirred up. Once he thudded into the bottom of the river, and\nhis lungs seemed about to burst before he was again shot to the top\nand managed to get a breath. At last the water quieted somewhat, and\nPhil, at the surface, saw the eel bury its head in a now apathetic\nmound of flesh.\n\nIt tore a portion loose with savage jaws, a portion that still writhed\nafter it was separated from the parent mass; and then the victor\nglided swiftly downstream, and disappeared under the surface....\n\nHolmes floated helplessly on the inky water. He could see the amoeba\nplainly; it was still partly paralyzed, for it was very still. But\nthen a faint tremor ran through it; a wave ran over its surface--and\nit moved slowly towards him once again.\n\nDesperately Phil tried to retreat. The will was there, but the body\nwould not work. Save for a feeble flutter of his hands and feet, he\ncould not move. He could not even turn around to bid Sue and David\nGuinness good-by--with his eyes....\n\nThen a fresh, loved voice sounded just behind him, and he felt\nsomething tighten around his waist.\n\n\"It's all right, dear!\" the voice called. \"Hang on; we'll get you\nout!\"\n\nSue had come in after him! She had grasped the rope tied to his belt,\nand she and her father were pulling him back to the bank!\n\nHe wanted to tell her to go back--the amoeba was only feet away--but\nhe could only manage a little croak. And then he was safe up on the\nledge at the other side of the river.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA surge of strength filled his limbs, and he knew the shock was\nrapidly wearing off. But it was also wearing off of the monster in the\nwater. Its speed increased; the ripplings of its amorphous\nbody-substance became quicker, more excited. It came on steadily.\n\nWhile it came, the girl and her father worked desperately over Phil,\nmassaging his body and pulling him further up the bank. It had all but\nreached the bank when Holmes gasped:\n\n\"I think I can walk now. Where--where did Quade go to?\"\n\nGuinness gestured over to the right, up a dim winding passage through\nthe rocks.\n\n\"Then we must follow--fast!\" Phil said, staggering to his feet. \"He\nmay get to the sphere first; he'll go up by himself even yet! I'm all\nright!\"\n\nDespite his words, he could not run, and could only command an awkward\nwalk. Sue lifted one of his arms around her shoulder, and her father\ntook the other, and without a backward glance they labored ahead. But\nPhil's strength quickly returned, and they raised the pace until they\nhad broken once more into a stumbling run.\n\nHow far ahead James Quade was, they did not know, but obviously they\ncould follow where he had gone. Once again the draft was strong on\ntheir backs. They felt sure they were on the last stretch, headed for\nthe earth-borer. But, unless they could overtake Quade, he would be\nthere first. They had no illusions about what that would mean....\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_A Death More Hideous_\n\nQuade was there first.\n\nWhen they burst out of a narrow crevice, not far from the\nfunnel-shaped opening they had originally entered, they saw him\nstanding beside the open door of the sphere as if waiting. The\nsearchlight inside was still on, and in its shaft of light they could\nsee that he was smiling thinly, once more his old, confident self. It\nwould only take him a second to jump in, slam the door and lock it. He\ncould afford a last gesture....\n\nThe three stopped short. They saw something he did not.\n\n\"So!\" he observed in his familiar, mocking voice. He paused, seeing\nthat they did not come on. He had plenty of time.\n\nHe said something else, but the two men and the girl did not hear what\nit was. As if by a magnet their eyes were held by what was hanging\nabove him, clinging to the lip of the hole the sphere had made in the\nceiling.\n\nIt was an amoeba, another of those single-celled, protoplasmic mounds\nof flesh. It had evidently come down through the hole; and now it was\nstretching, rubber-like, lower and lower, a living, reaching\nstalactite of whitish hunger.\n\nQuade was all unconscious of it. His final words reached Phil's\nconsciousness.\n\n\"... And this time, of course, I will keep the top disintegrators on.\nNo other monster will then be able to weigh me down!\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and turned to the door. And that movement\nwas the signal that brought his doom. Without a sound, the poised mass\nabove dropped.\n\nJames Quade never knew what hit him. The heap of whitish jelly fell\nsquarely. There was a brief moment of frantic lashing, of tortured\nstruggles--then only tiny ripples running through the monster as it\nfed.\n\nSue Guinness turned her head. But the two men for some reason could\nnot take their eyes away....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the girl's voice that jerked them back to reality. \"The other!\"\nshe gasped. \"It's coming, behind!\"\n\nThey had completely forgotten the mass in the tunnel. Turning, they\nsaw that it was only fifteen feet away and approaching fast, and\ninstinctively they ran out into the cavern, skirting the sphere\nwidely. When they came to Quade's wrecked borer Phil, who had snatched\na glance behind, dragged them down behind it. For he had seen their\npursuer abandon the chase and go to share in the meal of its fellow.\n\n\"We'd best not get too far away,\" he whispered. \"When they leave the\nfront of the borer, maybe we can make a dash for it.\"\n\nFor minutes that went like hours the young man watched, waiting for\nthe creatures to be done, hoping that they would go away. Fortunately\nthe sphere lay between, and he was not forced to see too much. Only\none portion of one of the monsters was visible, lapping out from\nbehind the machine....\n\nAt last his body tensed, and he gripped Sue and her father's arm in\nquick warning. The things were leaving the sphere. Or, rather, only\none was. For Phil saw that they had agglutenated--merged into\noneness--and now the monster that remained was the sum of the sizes of\nthe original two. And more....\n\nThey all watched. And they all saw the amoeba stop, hesitate for a\nmoment--and come straight for the wrecked borer behind which they were\nhidden.\n\n\"Damn!\" Phil whispered hoarsely. \"It's still hungry--and it's after\nus!\"\n\nDavid Guinness sighed wearily. \"It's heavy and sluggish, now,\" he\nsaid, \"so maybe if we run again.... Though I don't know how I can last\nany longer....\"\n\nHolmes did not answer. His eyes were narrowed; he was casting about\ndesperately for a plan. He hardly felt Sue's light touch on his arm as\nshe whispered:\n\n\"In case, Phil--in case.... This must be good-by....\"\n\nBut the young man turned to her with gleaming eyes. \"Good-by,\nnothing!\" he cried. \"We've still got a card to play!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stared at him, wondering if he had cracked from the strain of what\nhe had passed through. But his next words assured her he had not. \"Go\nback, Sue,\" he said levelly. \"Go far back. We'll win through this\nyet.\"\n\nShe hesitated, then obeyed. She crept back from the wrecked borer,\nback into the dim rear, eyes on Phil and the sluggish mass that moved\ninexorably towards him. When she had gone fifteen or twenty yards she\npaused, and watched the two men anxiously.\n\nPhil was talking swiftly to Professor Guinness. His voice was low and\nlevel, and though she could not hear the words she could catch the\ntone of assurance that ran through them. She saw her father nod his\nhead, and he seemed to make the gesture with vigor. \"I will,\" she\nheard him say; and he slapped Phil on the back, adding: \"But for God's\nsake, be careful!\"\n\nAnd with these words the old man wormed inside Quade's wrecked borer\nand was gone from the girl's sight.\n\nShe wanted desperately to run forward and learn what Phil intended to\ndo, but she restrained herself and obeyed his order. She waited, and\nwatched; and saw the young man stand up, look at the slowly advancing\nmonster--and deliberately walk right into its path!\n\nSue could not move from her fright. In a daze she saw Phil advance\ncautiously towards the amoeba and pause when within five feet of it.\nThe thing stopped; remained absolutely motionless. She saw him take\nanother short step forward. This time a pseudopod emerged, and reached\nslowly out for him. Phil avoided it easily, but by so narrow a margin\nthat the girl's heart stopped beating. Then she saw him step back;\nand, snail-like, the creature followed, pausing twice, as if wary and\nsuspicious. Slowly Phil Holmes drew it after him.\n\nTo Sue, who did not know what was his plan, it seemed a deliberate\ninvitation to death. She forgot about her father, lying inside the\nmangled borer, waiting. She did not see that Phil was leading the\nmonster directly in front of it....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a grotesque, silent pursuit. The creature appeared to be\nunalert; its movements were sloth-like; yet the girl knew that if Phil\nonce ventured an inch too close, or slipped, or tried to dodge past it\nto the sphere, its torpidness would vanish and it would have him. His\nmaneuvering had to be delicate, judged to a matter of inches. Tense\nwith the suspense, the strain of the slow-paced seconds, she\nwatched--and yet hardly dared to watch, fearful of the awful thing she\nmight see.\n\nIt was a fantastic game of tag her lover was playing, with death the\npenalty for tardiness. The slow, enticing movements were repeated\nagain and again, Phil advancing very close, and stepping back in the\nnick of time. Always he barely avoided the clutching white arms that\nwere extended, and little by little he decoyed the thing onward....\n\nThen came the end. As Holmes was almost in front of the wrecked\nmachine, Sue saw him glance quickly aside--and, as if waiting for that\nmoment when he would be off guard, the monster whipped forward in a\ngreat, reaching surge.\n\nSue's ragged nerves cracked: she shrieked. They had him! She started\nforward, then halted abruptly. With a tremendous leap, Phil Holmes had\nwrenched free and flung himself backwards. She heard his yell:\n\n\"Now!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a sputter from the bottom of the outstretched borer; then,\nlike the crack of a whip, came a bellow of awful sound.\n\nA thick cloud of dust reared up, and the ear-numbing thunder rolled\nthrough the cavern in great pulsing echoes. And then Sue Guinness\nunderstood what the young man had been about.\n\nThe disintegrators of James Quade's borer had sent a broad beam of\nannihilation into the monster. His own machine had destroyed his\ndestroyer--and given his intended victims their only chance to escape\nfrom the dread fate he had schemed for them.\n\nSue could see no trace of the creature in its pyre of slow-swirling\ndust. Caught squarely, its annihilation had been utter. And then,\nthrough the thunder that still echoed in her ear-drums, she heard a\njoyful voice.\n\n\"We got 'em!\"\n\nThrough the dusty haze Phil appeared at her side. He flung his arms up\nexultantly, swept her off the ground, hugged her close.\n\n\"We got 'em!\" he cried again. \"We're free--free to go up!\"\n\nProfessor David Guinness crawled from the borer. His face, for the\nfirst time since the descent, wore a broad smile. Phil ran over to\nhim, slapped him on the back; and the older man said:\n\n\"You did it beautifully, Phil.\" He turned to Sue. \"He had to decoy\nthem right in front of the disintegrators. It was--well, it was\nmagnificent!\"\n\n\"All credit to Sue: she was my inspiration!\" Phil said, laughing. \"But\nnow,\" he added, \"let's see if we can fix those dead rocket-tubes. I\nhave a patient up above--and, anyway, I'm not over-fond of this\nplace!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three had won through. They had blasted four miles down from the\nsurface of the earth. The brain of an elderly scientist, the\nquick-witted courage of a young engineer, had achieved the seemingly\nimpossible--and against obstacles that could not have been predicted.\nDeath had attended that achievement, as death often does accompany\ngreat forward steps; James Quade had gone to a death more hideous than\nthat he devised for the others. But, in spite of the justice of it, a\nmoment of silence fell on the three survivors as they came to the spot\nwhere his fate at last had caught up to him.\n\nBut it was only a moment. It was relieved by Professor Guinness's\npicking up the chunk of radium ore his former partner had hewn from\nthe cavern's wall. He held it up for all to see, and smiled.\n\n\"Here it is,\" he said simply.\n\nThen he led the way into his earth-borer, and the little door closed\nquietly and firmly into place.\n\nFor a few minutes slight tappings came from within, as if a wrench or\na screwdriver were being used. Then the tappings stopped, and all was\nsilence.\n\nA choke, a starting cough, came from beneath the sphere. A torrent of\nrushing sound burst out, and spears of orange flame spurted from the\nbottom and splashed up its sides, bathing it in fierce, brilliant\nlight. It stirred. Then, slowly and smoothly, the great ball of metal\nraised up.\n\nIt hit the edge of the hole in the ceiling, and hung there,\nhesitating. Side-rockets flared, and the sphere angled over. Then it\nslid, roaring, through the hole.\n\nSwiftly the spots of orange from its rocket-tube exhausts died to\npin-points. There were now almost twenty of them. And soon these\npin-points wavered, and vanished utterly.\n\nThen there was only blackness in the hole that went up to the surface.\nBlackness in the hole, calm night on the desert above--and silence, as\nif the cavern were brooding on the puny figures and strange machines\nthat had for the first time dared invade its solitude, in the realms\nfour miles within the earth....\n\n\n\n\nThe Lake of Light\n\n_By Jack Williamson_\n\n[Illustration: _The monster emanated power, sinister, malevolent\npower._]\n\n[Sidenote: In the frozen wastes at the bottom of the world two\nexplorers find a strange pool of white fire--and have a strange\nadventure.]\n\n\nThe roar of the motor rang loud in the frosty air above a desert of\nice. The sky above us was a deep purple-blue; the red sun hung like a\ncrimson eye low in the north. Three thousand feet below, through a\nhazy blue mist of wind-whipped, frozen vapor, was the rugged\nwilderness of black ice-peaks and blizzard-carved hummocks of snow--a\ngrim, undulating waste, black and yellow, splotched with crystal\nwhite. The icy wind howled dismally through the struts. We were flying\nabove the weird ice-mountains of the Enderby quadrant of Antarctica.\n\nThat was a perilous flight, across the blizzard-whipped bottom of the\nworld. In all the years of polar exploration by air, since Byrd's\nmemorable flights, this area had never been crossed. The intrepid\nBritisher, Major Meriden, with the daring American aviatrix whom the\nworld had known as Mildred Cross before she married him, had flown\ninto it nineteen years before--and like many others they had never\nreturned.\n\nFaintly, above the purring drone of the motor, I heard Ray Summers'\nshout. I drew my gaze from the desolate plateau of ice below and\nleaned forward. His lean, fur-hooded face was turned back toward me. A\nmittened hand was pointing, and thin lips moved in words that I did\nnot hear above the roar of the engine and the scream of the wind.\n\nI turned and looked out to the right, past the shimmering silver disk\nof the propeller. Under the blue haze of ice-crystals in the air, the\nice lay away in a vast undulating plain of black and yellow, broken\nwith splotches of prismatic whiteness, lying away in frozen desolation\nto the rim of the cold violet sky. Rising against that sky I saw a\ncurious thing.\n\nIt was a mountain of fire!\n\nBeyond the desert of ice, a great conical peak pointed straight into\nthe amethystine gloom of the polar heavens. It was brilliantly white,\na finger of milky fire, a sharp cone of pure light. It shone with\nwhite radiance. It was brighter, far brighter, than is the sacred cone\nof Fujiyama in the vivid day of Japan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor many minutes I stared in wonder at it. Far away it was; it looked\nvery small. It was like a little heap of light poured from the hand of\na fire-god. What it might be, I could not imagine. At first sight, I\nimagined it might be a volcano with streams of incandescent lava\nflowing down the side. I knew that this continent of mystery boasted\nMt. Erebus and other active craters. But there was none of the smoke\nor lurid yellow flame which accompanies volcanic eruptions.\n\nI was still watching it, and wondering, when the catastrophe took\nplace--the catastrophe which hurled us into a mad extravaganza of\namazing adventure.\n\nOur little two-place amphibian was flying smoothly, through air\nunusually good for this continent of storms. The twelve cylinders of\nthe motor had been firing regularly since we took off from Byrd's old\nstation at Little America fifteen hours before. We had crossed the\npole in safety. It looked as if we might succeed in this attempt to\npenetrate the last white spot on the map. Then it Happened.\n\nA sudden crack of snapping metal rang out sharp as a pistol report. A\nbright blade of metal flashed past the wing-struts, to fall in a\nflashing arc. The motor broke abruptly into a mad, deep-voiced roar.\nTerrific vibration shook the ship, until I feared that it would go to\npieces.\n\nRay Summers, with his usual quick efficiency, cut the throttle.\nQuickly the motor slowed to idling speed; the vibration stopped. A\nlast cough of the engine, and there was no sound save the shrill\nscreaming of the wind in the gloomy twilight of this unknown land\nbeyond the pole.\n\n\"What in the devil!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"The prop! See!\" Ray pointed ahead.\n\nI looked, and the dreadful truth flashed upon me. The steel propeller\nwas gone, or half of it at least. One blade was broken off at a jagged\nline just above the hub.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The propeller! What made it break? I've never heard--\"\n\n\"Search me!\" Ray grinned. \"The important thing is that it did. It was\nall-metal, of course, tested and guaranteed. The guarantee isn't worth\nmuch here. A flaw in the forging, perhaps, that escaped detection.\nAnd this low temperature. Makes metal as brittle as glass. And the\nthing may have been crystallized by the vibration.\"\n\nThe plane was coming down in a shallow glide. I looked out at the grim\nexpanse of black ice-crags and glistening snow below us, and it was\nfar from a comforting prospect. But I had a huge amount of confidence\nin Ray Summers. I have known him since the day he appeared, from his\nfather's great Arizona ranch, to be a freshman in the School of Mines\nat El Paso, where I was then an instructor in geology. We have knocked\nabout queer corners of the world together for a good many years. But\nhe is still but a great boy, with the bluff, simple manners of the\nWest.\n\n\"Do you think we can land?\" I asked.\n\n\"Looks like we've got to,\" he said, grimly.\n\n\"And what after that?\"\n\n\"How should I know? We have the sledge, tent, furs. Food, and fuel for\nthe primus to last a week. There's the rifle, but it must be a\nthousand miles to anything to shoot. We can do our best.\"\n\n\"We should have had an extra prop.\"\n\n\"Of course. But it was so many pounds, when every pound counted. And\nwho knew the thing would break?\"\n\n\"We'll never get out on a week's provisions.\"\n\n\"Not a shot! Too bad to disappoint Captain Harper.\" Ray grinned wanly.\n\"He ought to have the _Albatross_ around there by this time, waiting\nfor us.\" The _Albatross_ was the ship which had left us at Little\nAmerica a few months before, to steam around and pick us up at our\ndestination beyond Enderby Land. \"We're in the same boat with Major\nMeriden and his wife--and all those others. Lost without a trace.\"\n\n\"You've read Scott's diary--that he wrote after he visited the pole in\n1912--the one they found with the bodies?\"\n\n\"Yes. Not altogether cheerful. But we won't be trying to get out. No\nuse of that.\" He looked at me suddenly, grinning again. \"Say, Jim, why\nnot try for that shining mountain we saw? It looks queer enough to be\ninteresting. We ought to make it in a week.\"\n\n\"I'm with you,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI did not speak again, for the jagged ice-peaks were coming rather\nnear. I held my breath as the little plane veered around a slender\nblack spire and dropped toward a tiny scrap of smooth snow among the\nice-hummocks. I might have spared my anxiety. Under Ray's consumately\nskilful piloting, the skids struck the snow with hardly a shock. We\nglided swiftly over the ice and came to rest just short of a yawning\ncrevasse.\n\n\"Suppose,\" said Ray, \"that we spend the first night in the plane. We\nare tired already. We can keep warm here, and sleep. We've plenty of\nice to melt for water. Then we're off for the shining mountain.\"\n\nI agreed: Ray Summers is usually right. We got out the sledge, packed\nit, took our bearings, and made all preparations for a start to the\nluminous mountain, which was about a hundred miles away. The\nthermometer stood at twenty below, but we were comfortable enough in\nour furs as we ate a scanty supper and went to sleep in the cabin of\nthe plane.\n\nWe started promptly the next morning, after draining the last of the\nhot chocolate from our vacuum bottles, which we left behind. We had a\nlight but powerful sporting rifle, with telescopic sights, and several\nhundred rounds of ammunition. Ray put them in the pack, though I\ninsisted that we would never need them, unless a quick way out of our\npredicament.\n\n\"No, Jim,\" he said. \"We take 'em along. We don't know what we're going\nto find at the shining mountain.\"\n\nThe air was bitterly cold as we set out: it was twenty-five below and\na sharp wind was blowing. Only our toiling at the sledge kept us warm.\nWe covered eighteen miles that day, and made a good camp in the lee\nof a bare stone ridge.\n\nThat night there was a slight fall of snow. When we went on it was\nnearly thirty-five degrees below zero. The layer of fresh snow\nconcealed irregularities in the ice, making our pulling very hard.\nAfter an exhausting day we had made hardly fifteen miles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the following day the sky was covered with gray clouds, and a\nbitterly cold wind blew. We should have remained in the tent, but the\nshortage of food made it imperative that we keep moving. We felt\nimmensely better after a reckless, generous fill of hot pemmican stew;\nbut the next morning my feet were so painful from frost-bite that I\ncould hardly get on my fur boots.\n\nWalking was very painful to me that day, but we made a good distance,\nhaving come to smoother ice. Ray was very kind in caring for me. I\nbecame discouraged about going on at all: it was very painful, and I\nknew there was no hope of getting out. I tried to get some of our\nmorphine tablets, but Ray had them, and refused to be convinced that\nhe ought to go on without me.\n\nOn the next march we came in sight of the luminous mountain, which\ncheered me considerably. It was a curious thing, indeed. A\nstraight-sided cone of light it was, rather steeper than the average\nvolcano. Its point was sharp, its sides smooth as if cut with a\nmammoth plane. And it shone with a pure white light, with a steady and\nunchanging milky radiance. It rose out of the black and dull yellow of\nthe ice wilderness like a white finger of hope.\n\nThe next morning it was a little warmer. Ray had been caring for my\nfeet very attentively, but it took me nearly two hours to get on my\nfootgear. Again I tried to get him to leave me, but he refused.\n\nWe arrived at the base of the shining mountain in three more marches.\nOn the last night the fuel for the primus was all gone, having been\nused up during the very cold weather, and we were unable to melt water\nto drink. We munched the last of our pemmican dry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few minutes after we had started on the last morning, Ray stopped\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Look at that!\" he cried.\n\nI saw what he had seen--the wreck of an airplane, the wings crumpled\nup and blackened with fire. We limped up to it.\n\n\"A Harley biplane!\" Ray exclaimed. \"That is Major Meriden's ship! And\nlook at that wing! It looks like it's been in an electric furnace!\"\n\nI examined the metal wing; saw that it had been blackened with heat.\nThe metal was fused and twisted.\n\n\"I've seen a good many wrecks, Jim. I've seen planes that burned as\nthey fell. But nothing like that. The fuselage and engines were not\neven afire. Jim, something struck out from that shining mountain and\nbrought them down!\"\n\n\"Are they--\" I began.\n\nRay was poking about in the snow in the cockpits.\n\n\"No. Not here. Probably would have been better for them if they had\nbeen killed in the plane. Quick and merciful.\"\n\nHe examined the engines and propellers.\n\n\"No. Seems to be nothing wrong. Something struck them down!\"\n\nSoon we went on.\n\nThe shining mountain rose before us like a great cone of fire. It must\nhave been three thousand feet high, and about that in diameter at the\nbottom. Its walls were as smooth and straight as though turned from\nmilky rock crystal in a gigantic lathe. It shone with a steady,\nbrilliantly white radiance.\n\n\"That's no natural hill!\" Ray grunted beside me as we limped on.\n\nWe were less than a mile from the foot of the cone of fire. Soon we\nobserved another remarkable thing about it. It seemed that a straight\nband of silvery metal rose from the snow about its foot.\n\n\"Has it a wall around it?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Evidently,\" said Ray. \"Looks as if it's built on a round metal\nplatform. But by whom? When? Why?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe approached the curious wall. It was of a white metal, apparently\naluminum, or a silvery alloy of that metal. In places it was\ntwenty-five feet high, but more usually the snow and ice was banked\nhigh against it. The smooth white wall of the gleaming mountain stood\nseveral hundred yards back from the wall.\n\n\"Let's have a look over it.\" Ray suggested. \"We can get up on that\nhummock, against it. You know, this place must have been built by\nmen!\"\n\nWe clambered up over the ice, as he suggested, until our heads came\nabove the top of the wall.\n\n\"A lake of fire!\" cried Ray.\n\nIndeed, a lake of liquid fire lay before us. The white aluminum wall\nwas hardly a foot thick. It formed a great circular tank, nearly a\nmile across, with the cone of white fire rising in the center. And the\ntank was filled, to within a foot of the top, with shimmeringly\nbrilliant white fluid, bright and luminous as the cone--liquid light!\n\nRay dipped a hand into it. The hand came up with fingers of fire,\nradiant, gleaming, with shining drops falling from them. With a\nspasmodic effort, he flung off the luminous drops, rubbed his hand on\nhis garments, and got it back into its fur mitten.\n\n\"Gee, it's cold!\" he muttered. \"Freeze the horns off a brass\nbilly-goat!\"\n\n\"Cold light!\" I exclaimed. \"What wouldn't a bottle of that stuff be\nworth to a chemist back in the States!\"\n\n\"That cone must be a factory to make the stuff.\" Ray suggested,\nhugging his hand. \"They might pump the liquid up to the top, and then\nlet it trickle down over the sides: that would explain why the cone is\nso bright. The stuff might absorb sunlight, like barium sulphide. And\nthere could be chemical action with the air, under the actinic rays.\"\n\n\"Well, if somebody's making cold light, where does he use it?\"\n\n\"I'd like to find out, and strike him for a hot meal,\" Ray said,\ngrinning. \"It's too cold to live on top of the ground around here.\nThey must run it down in a cave.\"\n\n\"Then let's find the hole.\"\n\n\"You know it's possible we won't be welcome. This mountain of light\nmay be connected with the vanishing of all the aviators. We'd better\ntake along the rifle.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe set off around just outside the white metal wall. The snow and ice\nwas irregularly banked against it, but the wall itself was smooth and\nunbroken. We had limped along for some two miles, or more than halfway\naround the amazing lake of light. I had begun to doubt that we would\nfind anything.\n\nThen we came to a square metal tower, ten feet on a side, that rose\njust outside the silvery wall, to a level with its top. The ice was\nlow here; the tower rose twenty feet above its unequal surface. We\nfound metal flanges riveted to its side, like the steps of a ladder.\nThey were most inconveniently placed, nearly four feet apart; but we\nwere able to climb them, and to look down the shaft.\n\nIt was a straight-sided pit, evidently some hundreds of feet deep. We\ncould see a tiny square of light at the bottom, very far away. The\nflanges ran down the side forming the rungs of a ladder that gave\naccess to whatever lay at the bottom.\n\nWithout hesitation, Ray climbed over the side and started down. I\nfollowed him, feeling a great relief in getting out of the freezing\nwind. Ray had the rifle and ammunition strapped to his back, along\nwith a few other articles; and I had a small pack. We had abandoned\nthe sledge, with the useless stove and the most of our instruments.\nOur food was all gone.\n\nThe metal flanges were fully four feet apart, and it was not easy to\nscramble down from one to another; certainly not easy for one who was\ncold, hungry, thirsty, worn out with a week of exhausting marches, and\nsuffering the torture of frozen feet.\n\n\"You know, this thing was not built by men,\" Ray observed.\n\n\"Not built by men? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Men would have put the steps closer together. Jim, I'm afraid we are\nup against something--well--that we aren't used to.\"\n\n\"If men didn't build this, what did?\" I was astounded.\n\n\"Search me! This continent has been cut off from the rest of the world\nfor geologic ages. Such life as has been found here is not common to\nthe rest of the earth. It is not impossible that some form of life,\nisolated here, has developed intelligence and acquired the power to\nerect that cone of light--and to burn the wing off a metal airplane.\"\n\nMy thoughts whirled madly as we clambered down the shaft.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt must have taken us an hour to reach the bottom. I did not count the\nsteps, but it must have been at least a thousand feet. The air grew\nrapidly warmer as we descended. We both took off most of our heavy fur\ngarments, and left them hanging on the rungs.\n\nI was rather nervous. I felt the nearness of an intelligent, hostile\npower. I had a great fear that the owners of those steps would use\nthem to find us, and then crush us ruthlessly as they had brought down\nMeriden's plane.\n\nThe little square of white light below grew larger. Finally I saw Ray\nswing off and stand on his feet in a flood of white radiance below me.\nThe air was warm, moist, laden with a subtle unfamiliar fragrance that\nsuggested growing things. Then I stood beside Ray.\n\nWe stood on the bare stone floor of a huge cavern. It must have been\nof volcanic origin. The walls glistened with the sparkling smoothness\nof volcanic glass. It was a huge space. The black roof was a hundred\nfeet high, or more; the cave was some hundreds of feet wide. And it\nsloped away from us into dim distance as though leading into huger\ncavities below.\n\nThe light that shone upon us came from an amazing thing--a fall of\nliquid fire. From the roof plunged a sheer torrent of white\nbrilliantly luminous fluid, falling a hundred feet into a shimmering\npool of moon-flame. Shining opalescent mists swirled about it, and the\nceaseless roar of it filled the cave with sound. It seemed that a\nstream of the phosphorescent stuff ran off down the cave from the\npool, to light the lower caverns.\n\n\"Very clever!\" said Ray. \"They make the stuff up there at the cone and\nrun it in here to see by.\"\n\n\"This warm air feels mighty good,\" I remarked, pulling off another\ngarment.\n\nRay sniffed the air. \"A curious odor. Smells like something growing.\nWhere anything is growing there ought to be something to eat. Let's\nsee what we can find.\"\n\nOnly black obsidian covered the floor about us. Cautiously we skirted\nthe overflowing pool of white fire, and followed down the stream of it\nthat flowed toward the inner cavern. We had gone but a few hundred\nyards when suddenly Ray stopped me with a hand on my arm.\n\n\"Lie flat!\" he hissed. \"Quick!\"\n\nHe dived behind a huge mass of fire-born granite. I flung myself down\nbeside him.\n\n\"Something is coming up the trail by the shining river. And it isn't a\nman! It's between us and the light; we should be able to see it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoon I heard a curious scraping sound, and a little tinkle of metal. I\ncaught a whiff of a powerful odor--a strange, fishy odor--so strong\nthat it almost knocked me down.\n\nThe thing that made the scraping and the tinkle and the smell came\ninto view. The sight of it sickened me with horror.\n\nIt was far larger than a man; its body was heavy as a horse's, but\nnearer the ground. In form it suggested a huge crab, though it was not\nvery much like any crustacean I had ever seen. It was mostly red in\ncolor, and covered with a huge scarlet shell. It had five pairs of\nlimbs. The two forward pairs had pinchers, seemingly used as hands; it\nscraped along on the other three pairs. Yard-long antennae, slender\nand luminously green, wavered above a grotesque head. The many facets\nof compound eyes stood on the end of foot-long stalks.\n\nThe amazing crab-thing wore a metal harness. Bands of silvery aluminum\nwere fastened about its shell, with little cases of white metal\ndangling to them. In one of its uplifted claws it carried what seemed\nto be an aluminum bar, two feet long and an inch thick.\n\nIt scraped lumberingly past, between us and the racing stream of white\nfire. It passed less than a dozen feet from us. The curious fishy\nsmell of it was overpowering, disgusting.\n\nSweat of horror chilled my limbs. The monster emanated power,\nsinister, malevolent power, power intelligent, alien and hostile to\nman.\n\nI trembled with the fear that it would see us, but it scrambled\ngrotesquely on. When it was twenty yards past, Ray picked up a block\nof black lava that lay beneath his hand and hurled it silently and\nswiftly. It crashed splinteringly on the rocks far beyond the\ncreature, on the other side of the stream of light.\n\nIn fascination I watched the monster as it paused as if astonished.\nThe glittering compound eyes twisted about on their stalks, and the\nlong shining green tentacles wavered questioningly. Then the knobbed\nlimbs snapped the white metal tube to a level position. A metallic\nclick came from it.\n\nAnd a ray of red light, vivid and intense, burst from the tube. It\nflashed across the river of fire. With a dull, thudding burst it\nstruck the rocks where the stone had fallen. It must have been a ray\nof concentrated heat. Rocks beneath it flashed into sudden\nincandescence, splintered and cracked, flowed in molten streams.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment the intensely brilliant ruby ray flashed off. The rocks in\nthe circle where it had struck faded to a dull red and then to\nblackness, still cracking and crumbling.\n\nTo my intense relief, the monstrous crab lumbered on.\n\n\"That,\" Ray whispered, \"is what got Major Meriden's airplane wing.\"\n\nWhen we could hear its scraping progress no longer, we climbed up from\nbehind our boulder and continued cautiously down the cavern, beside\nthe rushing luminous river. In half a mile we came to a bend. Rounding\nit, we gazed upon a remarkable sight.\n\nWe looked into a huge cavity in the heart of the earth. A vast\nunderground plain lay before us, with the black lava of the roof\narching above it. It must have been miles across, though we had no way\nto measure it, and it stretched down into dim hazy distance. Its level\nwas hundreds of feet below us.\n\nAt our feet the glistening river of fire plunged down again in a\nmagnificent flaming fall. Below, its luminous liquid was spread out in\nrivers and lakes and canals, over all the vast plain. The channels ran\nthrough an amazing jungle. It was a forest of fungus, of mushroom\nthings with great fleshy stalks and spreading circular tops. But they\nwere not the sickly white and yellow of ordinary mushrooms, but were\nof brilliant colors, bright green, flaming scarlet, gold and\npurple-blue. Huge brilliant yellow stalks, fringed with crimson and\nblack, lifted mauve tops thirty feet or more. It was a veritable\nforest of flame-bright fungus.\n\nIn the center of this weirdly forested subterranean plain was a great\nlake, filled, not with the flaming liquid, but with dark crystal\nwater. And on the bottom of that lake, clearly visible from the\nelevation upon which we stood, was a city!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA city below the water! The buildings were upright cylinders in groups\nof two or three, of dozens, even of hundreds. For miles, the bottom of\nthe great lake was covered with them. They were all of crystal,\nazure-blue, brilliant as cylinders turned from immense sapphires. They\nwere vividly visible beneath the transparent water. Not one of them\nbroke the surface.\n\nThrough the clear black water we saw moving hundreds, thousands of the\ngiant crabs. The crawled over the hard, pebbled bottom of the lake, or\nswam between the crystal cylinders of the city. They were huge as the\none we had seen, with red shells, great ominous looking stalked eyes,\nluminous green tentacular antennae and knobbed claws on forelimbs.\n\n\"Looks as if we've run on something to write home about,\" Ray muttered\nin amazement.\n\n\"A whole city of them! A whole world! No wonder they could build that\ncone-mountain for a lighting plant!\"\n\n\"When they got to knocking down airplanes with that heat-ray,\" he\nspeculated, \"they were probably surprised to find that other animals\nhad developed intelligence.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose those mushroom things are good to eat?\"\n\n\"We can try and see--if the crabs don't get us first with a heat-ray.\nI'm hungry enough to try anything!\"\n\nAgain we cautiously advanced. The river of light fell over a sheer\nprecipice, but we found a metal ladder spiked to the rock, with rungs\nas inconveniently far apart as those in the shaft. It was five hundred\nfeet, I suppose, to the bottom; it took us many minutes to descend.\n\nAt last we stepped off in a little rocky clearing. The forest of\nbrilliant mushrooms rose about us, great fleshy stalks of gold and\ngraceful fringes of black and scarlet about them, with flattened heads\nof purple.\n\nWe started eagerly across toward the fungoid forest. I had visions of\ntearing off great pieces of soft, golden flesh and filling my aching\nstomach with it.\n\nWe were stopped by a sharp, poignantly eager human cry.\n\nA human being, a girl, darted from among the mushroom stalks and ran\nacross to us. Sobbing out great incoherent cries, she dropped at Ray's\nfeet, wrapped her arms about his knees and clung to him, while her\nslender body was wracked with sobbing cries.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first impression was that she was very beautiful--and that\nimpression I was never called upon to revise. About her lithe young\nbody she had the merest scrap of some curious green fabric--ample in\nthe warm air of the great cavern. Luxuriant brown hair fell loose\nabout her white shoulders. She was not quite twenty years old, I\nsupposed; her body was superbly formed, with the graceful curves and\nthe free, smooth movements of a wild thing.\n\nRay stood motionless for a moment, thunder-struck as I was, while the\nsobbing girl clung to his knees. Then the astonishment on his face\ngave place to pity.\n\n\"Poor kid!\" he murmured.\n\nHe bent, took her tenderly by the shoulder, helped her to her feet.\n\nHer beauty burst upon us like a great light. Smoothly white, her skin\nwas, perfect. Wide blue eyes, now appealing, even piteous, looked\nfrom beneath a wealth of golden brown hair. White teeth, straight and\neven, flashed behind the natural crimson of her lips.\n\nShe stood staring at Ray, in a sort of enchantment of wonder. An eager\nlight of incredible joy flamed in her amazing eyes; red lips were\nparted in an unconscious smile of joy. She looked like the troubled\nprincess in the fairy tale, when the prince of her dreams appeared in\nthe flesh.\n\n\"God, but you're beautiful!\" Ray's words slipped out as if he were\nhardly conscious of them. He flushed quickly, stepped back a little.\n\nThe girl's lips opened. She voiced a curious cry. It was deep toned,\npealing with a wonderful timbre. A happy burst of sound, like a baby\nmakes. But strong, ringing, musically golden. And pathetically eager,\npitifully glad, so that it brought tears to my eyes, cynical old man\nthat I am.\n\nI saw Ray wipe his eyes.\n\n\"Can you talk?\" Ray put the question in a clear, deliberate voice,\nwith great kindness ringing in it.\n\n\"Talk?\" The chiming, golden voice was slow, uncertain. \"Talk? Yes. I\ntalked--with mother. But for long--I have had no need to talk.\"\n\n\"Where is your mother?\" Ray's voice was gentle.\n\n\"She is gone. She was here when I was little.\" The clear, silvery\nvoice was more certain now. \"Once, when I was almost as big as\nshe--she was still. She was cold. She did not move when I called her.\nThe Things took her away. She was dead. She told me that sometime she\nwould be dead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBright tears came in the wide blue eyes, trickled down over the\nperfect face. A pathetic catch was in the deliberate, halting voice. I\nturned away, and Ray put a handkerchief to his face.\n\n\"What is your name? Who are you?\" Ray spoke kindly.\n\n\"I am Mildred. Mildred Meriden.\"\n\n\"Meriden!\" Ray turned to me. \"I bet this is a daughter of the major\nand his wife!\"\n\n\"Father was the major,\" the girl said slowly. \"He and mother came in a\nmachine that flew, from a far land. The Things burned the machine with\nthe red fire. They came here and the Things kept them. They made\nmother sing over the water. They killed father. I never saw him.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ray, said gently. \"We came from the same land. We saw your\nfather's machine above.\"\n\n\"You came from outside! And you are going back? Oh, take me with you!\nTake me!\" Piteous pleading was in her voice. \"It is so--lonely since\nthe Things took Mother away. Mother told me that sometime men would\ncome, and take me away to see the people and the outside that she told\nme of. Oh, please take me!\"\n\n\"Don't worry! You go along whenever we leave--if we can get out.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad! You are very good!\"\n\nImpulsively, she threw her arms around Ray's neck. Gently, he\ndisengaged himself, flushing a little. I noticed, however, that he did\nnot seem particularly displeased.\n\n\"But can we get out?\"\n\n\"Mother and I tried. We could never get out. The Things watch. They\nmake me come to the water to sing, when the great bell rings.\"\n\n\"Are these things goods to eat?\" I motioned to the brilliant fungal\nforest. I had begun to fear that Ray would never get to this very\nimportant topic.\n\nBlue eyes regarded me. \"Eat? Oh, you are hungry! Come! I have food.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a child, she grasped Ray's hand, pulled him toward the mushroom\njungle. I followed, and we slipped in between the brilliantly golden,\nfleshy stalks. They rose to the tangle of bright feathery fringes\nabove, huge and substantial as the trunks of trees.\n\nIn a few minutes we came to a wide, shallow canal, metal-walled,\nthrough which a slow current of the opalescent, luminous liquid was\nflowing. We crossed this on a narrow metal foot-bridge, and went on\nthrough the brilliant forest.\n\nSuddenly we emerged into a little clearing, with the black waters of\nthe great lake visible beyond it, across a quarter-mile of rocky\nbeach. In the middle of the open space, rose three straight cylinders\nof azure crystal, side by side. Each must have been twenty feet in\ndiameter, and forty high. They shone with a clear blue light, like the\ncylindrical buildings we had seen in the strange city of the\ncrab-creatures below the great lake.\n\nMildred Meriden, the strangely beautiful girl who had known no other\nworld than this amazing cavern empire where giant crabs reigned,\nbeckoned us with unconscious queenly grace to enter the arched door in\nthe blue sapphire wall of her remarkable abode of clustered cylinders.\n\nThe crystal of the walls seemed luminous, the lofty cylinders were\nfilled with a liquid, azure radiance. The high round room we entered\nwas strangely furnished. There was a silken couch, a bathing pool of\nblue crystal filled with sparkling water, a curious chest of drawers\nmade of bright aluminum with a mirror of polished crystal, its top\nbearing odd combs and other articles. The furnishings must have been\ndone by the giant crabs, under human direction.\n\nMildred led us quickly across the room, through an arched opening into\nanother. A round aluminum table stood in the center of the room, with\ntwo curious metal chairs beside it. Odd metal cabinets stood about the\nshining blue walls. The girl made us sit down, and put dishes before\nus.\n\nShe gave us each a bowl of thick, sweetish soup, darkly red; placed\nbefore us a dish piled high with little circular cakes, crisp and\nbrown, which had a tantalizing fragrance; poured for each of us a\ntransparent crystal goblet full of clear amber drink.\n\nWe fell to with enthusiasm and abandon.\n\n\"The Things made this place for father,\" the girl told us, as she\nwatched us eat, attentively replenishing the red soup in the great\nblue crystal bowl, or the little cakes, or the fragrant amber drink.\n\"They would give him anything he wanted. But he tried to go away with\nmother, and they killed him.\"\n\n\"We must get out of here,\" Ray declared when at last we had done. \"We\nmust get together a lot of food, and enough clothing for all of us. We\nought to be able to make it to the edge of the ice-pack. We've got to\ngive these crab-things the slip; we ought to get off before they know\nwe're here--unless they already do.\"\n\nMildred was eagerly attentive: she was so unused to human speech that\nit took the best of her efforts to understand us, though it seems that\nher mother had given her quite a wide education. She promised that\nthere would be no difficulty about the food.\n\n\"Mother taught me how to fix food,\" she said. \"She always said that\nsometime men would come, with weapons of fire and great noise that\nwould tear and kill the Things. I have food ready, in bags--more than\nwe can carry. I have, too, the furs that mother and father wore.\"\n\nShe ran into another room and returned with a great pile of fur\ngarments, which we examined and found to be in good condition.\n\n\"Now is the time,\" Ray said. \"I'd like to know more about the big\ncrabs, but there'll be a chance for that, later. Mildred is the\nimportant thing, now. We must get her out. Then we can tell the world\nabout this place and come back with a bigger expedition.\"\n\n\"You think we can reach the coast?\"\n\n\"I think so. It might be hard on Mildred. But we will have food; we\ncan probably find fuel for the stove in Meriden's plane, if the tanks\nwere well sealed. And Captain Harper should have a relief party landed\nand sent to meet us. We should have only three or four hundred miles\nto go alone.\"\n\n\"Three or four hundred miles, over country like we've been crossing in\nthe last week, with a girl! Ray, we'd never make it!\"\n\n\"It's the only chance.\"\n\nI said nothing more. I knew that I could stand no such march on my\nfrozen feet, but I resolved to say nothing about it. I would help them\nas far as I could, and then walk out of camp some night. Men have done\njust that.\n\nMildred brought out sacks of the little cakes, and of a red powder\nthat seemed to be the dried and ground flesh of a crimson mushroom. We\nmade a pack for each of us, as heavy as we could carry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust before we were ready to start Ray took off my footgear and\ntreated my feet from his medicine kit. I had feared gangrene, but he\nassured me that there was no danger if they were well cared for.\nWalking was still exquisitely painful to me as we slipped out through\nthe arched door and into the fungoid forest beyond the three blue\ncylinders.\n\nAs rapidly and silently as possible we hastened through the brilliant\nfungous forest, across the river of opalescent liquid, to the foot of\nthe fall of fire. A weird and splendid sight was that sheer arc of\nshimmering white flame, roaring into a pool of opal light, and\nsurrounded with a mist of moon-flame.\n\nWe reached the foot of the metal ladder spiked to the rocks beside the\nfall and started up immediately. The going was not easy. The packs of\nfood, heavy enough when we were on level ground, were difficult indeed\nto lift when one was scrambling up over rungs four feet apart.\n\nRay climbed ahead, with a piece of rope fastened from his waist to\nMildred's, so that he could help her if she slipped. I was below the\ngirl. We were halfway up the rock when suddenly a glare of red light\nshone upon me, casting my shadow sharply on the cliff. I looked up\nand saw the broad, intensely red beam of a heat-ray like that we had\nseen the giant crab use.\n\nThe ray came, evidently, from the shore of the great lake with its\nsubmerged city of blue cylinders. It fell upon the face of the cliff\njust above us. Quickly the ladder was heated to cherry red. The face\nof the rock grew incandescent, cracked. Hot sparks rained down upon\nus.\n\nSlowly the ray moved down, toward us.\n\n\"Guess we'd better call it off,\" said Ray. \"They have the advantage\nright now. Better get to climbing down, Jim. This ladder is going to\nbe burning my hands pretty soon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI climbed down. Mildred and Ray scrambled down behind me.\n\nThe ray followed us, keeping the metal at a cherry red just above\nRay's hands.\n\nI looked down and saw a dozen of the giant crabs lumbering up out of\nthe fungoid jungle from the direction of the great lake. Hideous\nthings they were, with staring, stalked eyes, shining green antennae,\npolished red shells, claw-armed limbs. Like the one that had passed us\nin the upper cavern, they wore glistening white metal accoutrements.\n\nWe clambered down, with the red ray following.\n\nI dropped to the ground among them, wet with the sweat of horror. I\nreeled in nausea from the intolerable odor of the crab-things; it was\nindescribable, overpowering.\n\nCurious rasping stridulations came from them, sounds which seemed to\nserve as means of communication, and which Mildred evidently\nunderstood.\n\n\"They say that you will not be harmed, but that you must not go out,\"\nshe called down.\n\nI was seized by the pincher-like claws, held writhing in an\nunbreakable grasp, while the glittering eyes twisted about, looked at\nme, and the shining green tentacles wavered questioningly over me. My\nstomach revolted at the horrible odor.\n\nThe crabs tore off my pack, even my clothing. Ray was similarly\ntreated as soon as he reached the ground. Though they took Mildred's\npack, they treated her with a curious respect.\n\nIn a few minutes they released us. They had taken the packs, the rifle\nand ammunition, our medicine kit and the few instruments we had\nbrought with us down the shaft, even our clothing. They turned us\nloose stark naked. Ray's face and neck went beet-red when he saw\nMildred standing by him.\n\nThe rasping sound came from one of them again.\n\n\"It says you may stay with me,\" Mildred said. \"They will not harm you\nunless you try again to get away. If you do, you die--as father did.\nThey will keep what they took from you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral of the creatures went scraping off, carrying the articles they\nhad taken from us either in their claws or in the metal cases they\nwore. Several waited, staring at us with the stalked compound eyes,\nand waving the green antennae as if they were organs of some special\nsense.\n\nTwo of the creatures waited at the foot of the metal ladder, holding\nthe long slender white tubes of the heat-ray in their claws.\n\n\"They say we can go now,\" Mildred said.\n\nShe led the way toward the edge of the brilliant jungle. She seemed to\nbe without false modesty, for I saw her glancing with evident\nadmiration at Ray's lithe and powerful white-skinned figure. We\nfollowed her into the giant mushrooms, glad to escape the overpowering\nstench of the crabs.\n\nIn a few minutes we arrived again at the strange building of the three\nblue cylinders. Mildred, noticing our discomfort, produced for each of\nus a piece of white silken fabric with which we draped ourselves.\n\nShe had noticed my difficulty in walking on bare feet. She had me\nbathe them, then dressed them with a soothing yellow oil, and bandaged\nthem skilfully.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" she said later, \"it is good to have both of you here with\nme. I am sorry indeed for you that you may never see your country\nagain. But it is good fortune for me. I was so lonely.\"\n\n\"These damned crabs don't know me!\" Ray Summers muttered. \"They think\nI'll play around like a pet kitten, for the rest of my life! They'll\nget their eyes opened. We'll spend the winter on Palm Beach yet!\"\n\n\"It seems to me that we're rather outnumbered.\" I said. \"And it's\nrather more pleasant in here than outside.\"\n\n\"I'm going to get that rifle,\" Ray declared, \"and give these big crabs\na little respect for humanity!\"\n\n\"Let's rest up a while first, anyhow,\" I urged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently Mildred noticed how tired we were. She went into the third\nof the connected cylinders of blue crystal, was busy a few minutes and\ncalled us to the couches she had prepared there.\n\n\"You may sleep,\" she told us. \"The Things never come here. And they\nsaid they would not harm you, if you did not try to go out.\"\n\nWe lay down on the silken beds. In a few minutes I was sleep. I awoke\nto feel a curious unease, a sense of impending catastrophe. Ray was\nbending over me, his face drawn with anxiety.\n\n\"Something's happened!\" he whispered. \"She's gone!\"\n\nI sat up, staring into the liquid blue vastness of the tall cylinder\nabove us.\n\n\"Listen! What's that?\"\n\nA deep bell-note sounded out, brazen, clanging. Sonorous, throbbing,\nmighty, it rang through the cylindered rooms. Slowly it died; faded to\nsilence with a last ringing pulse. Tense minutes of silence passed.\nAgain it boomed out, throbbed, and died. After more long minutes there\nwas yet a third.\n\n\"Outside, somewhere!\"\n\nRay started; ran to the arched door. We looked out upon the dense\nforest of gold and crimson mushrooms that grew below the black cavern\nroof. Before us, across a few hundred yards of bare rocky beach, was\nthe edge of the crystal lake with the city of blue cylinders upon its\nfloor.\n\n\"God! What's that?\" Ray gripped my arm crushingly.\n\nA thin wailing scream came across the beach from the black lake. A\npiteous sound it was, plaintive, pleading. Higher and higher it rose,\nuntil it was a piercing silver note. Clear and sweet it was, but\ninexpressibly lonely, sorrowful, mournful. It sank slowly, died away.\nAgain it rose and fell, and again.\n\n\"It's Mildred!\" I gasped. \"Didn't she say something about singing to\nthe crabs?\"\n\n\"Yes! I think she did. Well, if that's singing, it's wonderful! Had me\nfeeling like I'd never see another human. But listen--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLiquid, trilling notes were rising, pealing out in a queer, swift\nrhythm. It was happy, joyous, carefree. The rippling golden tones made\nme think of the caroling of birds on a spring morning. Swiftly it rose\nand fell, pure and clear as the tinkle of a mountain brook.\n\nMildred sang not words but notes of pure music.\n\nThe gay song died.\n\nAnd the strong clear voice rose again with the force and challenge of\nbugle notes, with a swift marching time beating through it. It\nthrobbed to a rhythm strange to me. It set my feet tingling to move;\nit set my heart to pulsing faster. It was a challenge to action, to\nbattle.\n\nUnconsciously obeying the suggestion of the song, Ray whispered,\n\"Let's get over and see what's going on.\"\n\nWe leaped through the door and ran across four hundred yards of rocky\nbeach to the edge of the lake. We stepped on a granite bluff a few\nyards above the water, to gaze upon as strange a sight as men ever\nsaw.\n\nThe black water lay before us, a transparent crystal sheet. On its\nrocky bottom we could see the innumerable clusters of upright azure\ncylinders that were the city of the crabs. The blue cylinders seemed\nto bend and waver in the water.\n\nA hundred yards away from us, over the dark water, was Mildred. She\nstood on a slender azure cylinder that came just to the surface. Tall,\nslender, superbly graceful, with only the scant bodice of green silken\nstuff about her, she looked like the statue of a goddess in white\nmarble. Her head was thrown up, golden-brown hair fell behind her\nshoulders, and the pure notes of her song rang over the water.\n\nBeyond her, all about her, were thousands upon thousands of the giant\ncrabs, swimming at the surface of the water. Their green antenna rose\nabove the water, a curious forest of luminous tentacles, flexing,\nwavering. Green coils moved and swung in time to the strange rhythm of\nher song.\n\nThe last note died. Her white arms fell in a gesture of finality. The\nthousands of twisting green antennae vanished below the water, and the\ngiant red crabs swam swiftly back to the tall blue cylinders of their\nsubmerged city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe white goddess turned and saw us.\n\nHer voice rang out in a golden shout of welcome. With a clean dive she\nslipped into the water and came swimming swiftly toward us. Her slim\nwhite body glided through the crystal water as smoothly as a fish.\nReaching the shore she sprang to her feet and ran to meet Ray.\n\n\"The Things come together when the giant bell rings, to listen to my\nsong,\" she said. \"They like my singing, as they liked mother's. But\nfor that, they would not let us live. That is the reason they would\nnot let us go.\"\n\n\"I like your singing, too,\" Ray informed her. \"Though at first you\nmade me cry. It was so lonely.\"\n\n\"The song was lonely because I have been lonely. Did you hear the glad\nsong I sang because you have come?\"\n\n\"Sure! Great stuff! Made me feel like a kid at Christmas!\"\n\n\"Come,\" she said. \"We will eat.\"\n\nLike a child, she took Ray's hand again, smiling naively up at him as\nshe led the way toward the three sapphire cylinders.\n\nBack in the blue-vaulted dining room, Ray made Mildred sit with me at\nthe little metal table while he served the little brown cakes and the\ndark-red soup and the fragrant amber drink. Mildred got up and brought\na great metal bowl filled with tiny purple fruits that had a\ndelicious, piquant tang.\n\nRay was deeply thoughtful as he ate. Suddenly he sat back and cried\nout:\n\n\"I've got it!\"\n\n\"Got what?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I want that rifle! Mildred can find out where it is. Then, when she\nsings, the crabs will all come. I'll get the gun, while she is\nsinging, and hide it. Then when it comes time to get out, she will\nsing while you and I are getting our packs up the cliff. I can cover\nthem with the rifle while she gets up to us.\"\n\n\"Looks good enough,\" I agreed, \"provided they all come to hear the\nsinging.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe explained the plan at greater length to the girl. She assured him\nthat the crabs all come when the bell-notes sound. She thought that\nshe could make them return her furs, and find out where they had put\nthe gun.\n\nMy feet were much better than they had been, and Mildred dressed them\nagain with the yellow oil. Ray examined them, said that I should be\nable to walk as well as ever in a few days.\n\nConsiderable time went by. Since the crabs had taken our watches, we\nhad no very accurate way of counting days; but I think we slept about\na dozen times. Ray and Mildred spent a good deal of time together, and\nseemed not altogether to hate each other. By the end of the time my\nfeet were quite well; I did not even lose a toe.\n\nWe went over our plans for escape in great detail. The crabs had\nconfiscated our clothing. Mildred managed to secure the return of her\nfurs, and, incidentally, while she was about it, learned where the\nrifle was.\n\nFortunately, perhaps realizing that it would be ruined by water, the\ncrabs had not taken it to their submerged city. Being amphibious, they\nlived above water as easily as below, and much of their industrial\nequipment was above the surface. The great pumps which lifted the\nwhite phosphorescent liquid from the canals back to the cone above the\nground were located beyond the great lake. I did not see the place,\nbut Ray tells me that they had great engines and a wealth of strange\nand complex machinery there. It was at these pumps that they had left\nour rifle and instruments, as Mildred found when she was recovering\nher furs.\n\nThey had taken our food, and we prepared as much more as we could\ncarry, arranged sacks for it, and made quilted garments for ourselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the three brazen notes clanged out, and Mildred ran across the\nbeach and swam out to the blue cylinder to sing. Ray slipped hurriedly\naway, while the green forest of antennae was still growing up from the\nwater about the girl.\n\nI waited above the beach, enchanted by the haunting, wordless melody\nof the gongs. It seemed that only a few minutes had passed, though it\nmay have been an hour or more, when Ray was by my side again. He\nflourished the rifle.\n\n\"I've got it! In good shape, too. Hasn't even been fired, though it\nlooks like they have opened a box of cartridges, and cut open one or\ntwo. Maybe they didn't understand the outfit--or it may be such a\nprimitive weapon that they aren't interested in it.\"\n\nWe hurried up to the building of blue cylinders and carefully hid the\ngun and ammunition, as well as a sun compass, a pair of prism\nbinoculars, and a few other articles Ray had recovered.\n\nIn a few minutes Mildred, having seen Ray's return, finished her song\nand ran up to join us. We arranged our packs, and waited the next call\nof the throbbing brazen gong to make the attempt for freedom.\n\nWe slept twice again before the clang of the great gong. Ray and\nMildred were always together; I could not see that they were at all\nimpatient.\n\nThe bell note came, the awful brazen vibration of it ringing on the\nblack cavern roof. It came when we were eating, in the liquid\nturquoise radiance of the lofty cylinder. We sprang out. Ray gave his\nlast directions to Mildred.\n\n\"Give us time to get to the top of the cliff by the shining fall. Then\nswim ashore and run. They may not notice. And if they do, we give 'em\na taste of lead!\"\n\nI was not very much surprised when he took the girl in his arms and\nput a burning kiss on her red lips. She gasped, but her struggles\nsubsided very quickly; she clung to him as he freed her.\n\nShe paused a moment in the door, before she ran down across the beach.\nA radiant light of joy was burning in her great blue eyes, even though\ntears were glistening there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRay and I waited, to give time for the giant crabs that guarded the\nladder to get away. In about ten more minutes the second brazen gong\nsounded, and presently the third. We gathered up the heavy packs of\nfood. Ray took the rifle and I the binoculars, and we slipped out into\nthe brilliant mushroom forest.\n\nI stepped confidently out of the jungle into the clearing below the\nsplendid opalescent fall of fire--and threw myself backward in\ntrembling panic. A flaming crimson ray cut hissing into the towering\nmushrooms above my head.\n\nMildred's confidence that the crabs would all gather at the ringing of\nthe gong had been mistaken. The two guards had been waiting at the\nfoot of the ladder, their flaming heat-rays ready for use.\n\nAs I dived back into the jungle, I heard two quick reports of the\nrifle. I scrambled awkwardly to my feet, beneath the heavy pack. Ray\nstood alert beside me, the smoking rifle in his hand. The giant crabs\nhad collapsed by the foot of the ladder, in grotesque and hideous\nmetal-bound heaps of red shell and twisted limb. Blood was oozing from\na ragged hole in the head of each.\n\n\"Glad they were here,\" Ray muttered. \"I wanted to try the gun out on\n'em. They're soft enough beneath the shell; the bullet tears 'em up\ninside. Let's get a move on!\"\n\nHe sprang past the revolting carcasses. I followed, holding my nose\nagainst their nauseating, charnel-house odor. We scrambled up the\nmetal ladder.\n\nAs we climbed, I could hear the haunting melody of Mildred's wordless\nsong coming faint across the distance. Once I glanced back for a\nmoment, and glimpsed her tiny white figure above the black water, with\nthe thousands of green antennae rising in a luminous forest about her.\n\nWe reached the top of the cliff, where the opalescent river plunged\ndown in the flaming fall. Ray chose convenient boulders for shelter\nand quickly we flung ourselves flat. Ray replaced the fired cartridges\nin the rifle and leveled it across the rock before him. I unslung the\nbinoculars and focussed them.\n\n\"Watch 'em close,\" Ray muttered. \"And tell me when to shoot.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe black lake lay below us, with the weird city of sapphire cylinders\non its floor. I got the glasses upon Mildred's white form. Soon she\ndived from the turquoise pedestal, swam swiftly ashore and vanished in\nthe vivid fungous jungle. The wavering green antennae vanished below\nthe water; I watched the crabs swimming away. Some of them climbed out\nof the water and lumbered off in various directions.\n\nIn fifteen minutes the slender white form of Mildred appeared at the\nfoot of the ladder. She sprang over the dead crabs and scrambled\nnimbly up. Soon she was halfway up the face of the cliff, and there\nhad been no sign of discovery. My hopes ran high.\n\nI was sweeping the whole plain with the binoculars, while Ray peered\nthrough the telescopic sights of the rifle. Suddenly I saw a giant\ncrab pause as he lumbered along the edge of the black lake. He rose\nupright; his shining green antennae wavered. Then I saw him reaching\nwith a knobbed claw for a slender silver tube slung to his harness.\n\n\"Quick! The one by the lake! To the right of that canal!\"\n\nI pointed quickly. Ray swung his gun about, aimed. A broad red beam\nflashed from the tube the thing carried, and fell upon the cliff. The\nreport of Ray's rifle rang thunderously in my ears. The red ray was\nsnapped off abruptly, and the giant crab rolled over into the black\nwater of the lake. Half a dozen of the huge crabs were in sight. They\nall took alarm, probably having seen the flash of the red ray. They\nraised grotesque heads, twisted stalked eyes and waved green antennae.\nSome of them began to raise the metal tubes of the heat-ray.\n\n\"Let's get all there are in sight!\" Ray muttered.\n\nHe began firing regularly, with deliberate precision. A few times he\nhad to take two shots, but ordinarily one was enough to bring down a\ngiant crab in a writhing red mass. Three times a red ray flashed out,\nonce at the girl clambering up the ladder, twice at our position above\nthe precipice. But the intense color of the ray announced its source,\nand Ray stopped each before it could be focussed to do damage.\n\nI looked over at Mildred and saw that she was still climbing bravely,\na little over a hundred feet below.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the great red crabs began to climb out of the water, heat-ray\ntubes grasped in their claws. Ray fired as fast as he could load and\naim. Still he shot with deliberate care, and almost every shot was\neffective.\n\nIntense, ruby-red rays flashed up from the lake shore. Twice, one of\nthem beat scorchingly upon us for a moment. Once a rock beside us was\nfused and cracked with the heat. But Ray fired rapidly, and the rays\nwinked out as fast as they were born.\n\nHe was powder-stained, black and grimy. The heat-ray had singed his\nclothing. He was dripping perspiration. The gun was so hot that he\ncould hardly handle it. But still the angry bark of the rifle rang\nout, almost with a deliberate rhythm. Ray was a fine shot in his youth\non his father's Arizona ranch, but his best shooting, I think, was\ndone from above that cascade of liquid fire, at the hordes of monster\nscarlet crabs.\n\nMildred scrambled over the edge, unharmed. Her breast was heaving, but\nher face was bright with joy.\n\n\"You are wonderful!\" she gasped to Ray.\n\nWe seized the packs and beat a hurried retreat. A crimson forest of\nthe heat-rays flashed up behind us, and flamed upon the black walls\nand roof of the cavern until glistening lava became incandescent,\ncracked and fused.\n\nWe were below the line of the rays. Quickly we made the bend in the\ncavern and followed at a halting run up the path beside the shimmering\nriver of opalescent light. Before us the torrent of fire fell in a\nmagnificent flaming arc from the roof.\n\nWe rounded the pool of lambent milk of flame, passed the roaring\ntorrent of coruscating liquid radiance and reached the ladder in the\nsquare, metal shaft. \"If we can get to the top before they can get up\nhere, we're safe,\" Ray said. \"If we don't, this shaft will be a\nchimney of fire.\"\n\nIn the haste of desperation, we attacked the thousand-foot climb. I\nwent first, Mildred below me, and Ray, with the rifle, in the rear.\nOur heavy packs were a terrible impediment, but we dared not attempt\nto go on without them. The metal rungs were four feet apart; it was no\neasy task to scramble from one to the next, again and again, for\nhundreds of times.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt must have taken us an hour to make it. We should have been caught\nlong before we reached the top, but the giant crabs were slow in their\nlumbering movements. Despite their evident intelligence, they seemed\nto lack anything like our railways and automobiles.\n\nThe cold gray light of the polar sky came about us; a dull,\npurple-blue square grew larger above. I clambered over the last rung,\nflung myself across the top of the metal shaft. Looking down at the\ntiny fleck of white light so far below, I saw a bit of red move in it.\n\n\"A crab!\" I shouted. \"Hurry!\"\n\nMildred was just below me. I took her pack and helped her over the\nedge.\n\nRed flame flared up the shaft.\n\nWe reached over, seized Ray's arms and fairly jerked him out of the\nruby ray.\n\nThe bitterly cold wind struck our hot, perspiring bodies as we\nscrambled down the rungs outside the square metal shaft. Mildred\nshivered in her thin attire.\n\n\"Out of the frying pan into the ice box!\" Ray jested grimly as we\ndropped, to the frozen plain.\n\nQuickly we tore open our packs. Ray and I snatched out clothing and\nwrapped up the trembling girl. In a few minutes we had her snugly\ndressed in the fur garments that had been Major Meriden's. Then we got\ninto the quilted garments we had made for ourselves.\n\nThe intensely red heat-beam still flared up the shaft. Ray looked at\nit in satisfaction.\n\n\"They'll have it so hot they can't get up it for some time yet,\" he\nremarked hopefully.\n\nWe shouldered our packs and set out over the wilderness of snow,\nturning our backs upon the metal-bound lake of fire, with the tall\ncone of iridescent flame rising in its center.\n\nThe deep, purple-blue sky was clear, and, for a rarity, there was not\nmuch wind. I doubt that the temperature was twenty below. But it was a\nviolent change from the warm cavern. Mildred was blue and shivering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn two hours the metal rim below the great white cone had vanished\nbehind the black ice-crags. We passed near the wreck of Major\nMeriden's plane and reached our last camp, where we had left the tent\nsledge, primus stove, and most of our instruments. The tent was still\nstretched, though banked with snow. We got Mildred inside, chafed her\nhands, and soon had her comfortable.\n\nThen Ray went out and soon returned with a sealed tin of oil from the\nwrecked plane, with which he lit the primus stove. Soon the tent was\nwarm. We melted snow and cooked thick red soup. After the girl had\nmade a meal of the scalding soup, with the little golden cakes, she\nprofessed to be feeling as well as ever.\n\n\"We can fix our plane!\" Ray said. \"There's a perfectly good prop on\nMeriden's plane!\"\n\nWe went back to the wreck, found the tools, and removed an undamaged\npropeller. This we packed on the sledge, with a good supply of fuel\nfor the stove.\n\n\"I'm sure we're safe now, so far as the crab-things go,\" he said. \"I\ndon't fancy they'd get around very well in the snow.\"\n\nIn an hour we broke camp, and made ten miles of the distance back to\nthe plane before we stopped. We were anxious about Mildred, but she\nseemed to stand the journey admirably; she is a marvelous physical\nspecimen. She seemed running over with gay vivacity of spirit; she\nasked innumerable questions of the world which she had known only at\nsecond-hand from her mother's words.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe weather smiled on us during the march back to the plane as much as\nit had frowned on the terrible journey to the cone. We had an\nabundance of food and fuel, and we made it in eight easy stages. Once\nthere was a light fall of snow, but the air was unusually warm and\ncalm for the season.\n\nWe found the plane safe. It was the work of but a short time to remove\nthe broken propeller and replace it with the one we had brought from\nthe wrecked ship. We warmed and started the engine, broke the skids\nloose from the ice, turned the plane around, and took off safely from\nthe tiny scrap of smooth ice.\n\nMildred seemed amazed and immensely delighted at the sensations of her\nfirst trip aloft.\n\nA few hours later we were landing beside the _Albatross_, in the\nleaden blue sea beyond the ice barrier. Bluff Captain Harper greeted\nus in amazed delight as we climbed to the deck.\n\n\"You're just in time!\" he said. \"The relief expedition we landed came\nback a week ago. We had no idea you could still be alive, with only a\nweek's provisions. We were sailing to-morrow. But tell us! What\nhappened? Your passenger--\"\n\n\"We just stopped to pick up my fiancee,\" Ray grinned. \"Captain, may I\npresent Miss Mildred Meriden? We'll be wanting you to marry us right\naway.\"\n\n\nTHE MENACE OF THE INSECT\n\nIt is possible that future study may tell man enough about insects to\nenable him to eradicate them. This, however, is more than can be\nreasonably expected, for the more we cultivate the earth the better we\nmake conditions for these enemies. The insect thrives on the work of\nman. And having made conditions ideal for the insect, with great\nexpanses of cultivated food fitted to his needs, it is an optimist who\ncan believe that at the same time we can make other conditions which\nwill be so unfavorable as to cause him to disappear completely. The\ntwo things do not go together.\n\nThe insect is much better fitted for life than is man. He can survive\nlong periods of famine, he can survive extremes of heat and cold. The\ninsect produces great numbers of young which have no long period of\ninfancy requiring the attention of the parents over a large part of\ntheir life. Every function of the insect is directed toward the\npropagation of the race and the use of minimum effort in every other\ndirection.\n\nIt is even possible in some cases, the water flea, for example, for\nthe female to produce young without the necessity of fertilization by\nthe male. In order to perform the necessary work to insure food\nsupplies for the winter other insects have developed highly\nspecialized workers, especially fitted to do particular kinds of\nlabor. Ants and termites are in this class.\n\nIf we examine the organization of insects closely we shall find but\none point at which they are vulnerable. This is in their lack of\nability to reason. True, there is considerable evidence to support the\nbelief that some insects are capable of simple reasoning, but the\ndevelopment in this direction is only of the most elementary nature.\nAs compared to man it is safe to say that they do not reason. They are\nguided by instinct.\n\nThis again is the most efficient way to organize their affairs. It\nrequires no long period of training. They can begin performing all\ntheir useful functions as soon as their bodily development makes it\npossible. No one need teach them how to catch their prey, how to build\ntheir nests or shelters. Instinct takes care of this. But this,\nobviously the best system in a world wholly governed by instinct, is\nnot so desirable when the instinctively actuated insect encounters\nanother form of life, as man, which is capable of reason. The\nreasoning individual can play all kinds of tricks on the individual\nwho is actuated by instinct.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ghost World\n\n_By Sewell Peaslee Wright_\n\n[Illustration: _My whole attention was focused upon the strange\nbeings._]\n\n[Sidenote: Commander John Hanson records another of his thrilling\ninterplanetary adventures with the Special Patrol Service.]\n\n\nI was asleep when our danger was discovered, but I knew the instant\nthe attention signal sounded that the situation was serious. Kincaide,\nmy second officer, had a cool head, and he would not have called me\nexcept in a tremendous emergency.\n\n\"Hanson speaking!\" I snapped into the microphone. \"What's up, Mr.\nKincaide?\"\n\n\"A field of meteorites sweeping into our path, sir.\" Kincaide's voice\nwas tense. \"I have altered our course as much as I dared and am\nreducing speed at emergency rate, but this is the largest swarm of\nmeteorites I have ever seen. I am afraid that we must pass through at\nleast a section of it.\"\n\n\"With you in a moment, Mr. Kincaide!\" I dropped the microphone and\nsnatched up my robe, knotting its cord about me as I hurried out of my\nstateroom. In those days, interplanetary ships did not have their\nauras of repulsion rays to protect them from meteorites, it must be\nremembered. Two skins of metal were all that lay between the _Ertak_\nand all the dangers of space.\n\nI took the companionway to the navigating room two steps at a time and\nfairly burst into the room.\n\nKincaide was crouched over the two charts that pictured the space\naround us, microphone pressed to his lips. Through the plate glass\npartition I could see the men in the operating room tensed over their\nwheels and levers and dials. Kincaide glanced up as I entered, and\nmotioned with his free hand towards the charts.\n\nOne glance convinced me that he had not overestimated our danger. The\nspace to right and left, and above and below, was fairly peppered with\ntiny pricks of greenish light that moved slowly across the milky faces\nof the charts.\n\nFrom the position of the ship, represented as a glowing red spark, and\nmeasuring the distances roughly by means of the fine black lines\ngraved in both directions upon the surface of the chart, it was\nevident to any understanding observer that disaster of a most terrible\nkind was imminent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKincaide muttered into his microphone, and out of the tail of my eye I\ncould see his orders obeyed on the instant by the men in the operating\nroom. I could feel the peculiar, sickening surge that told of speed\nbeing reduced, and the course being altered, but the cold, brutally\naccurate charts before me assured me that no action we dared take\nwould save us from the meteorites.\n\n\"We're in for it, Mr. Kincaide. Continue to reduce speed as much as\npossible, and keep bearing away, as at present. I believe we can avoid\nthe thickest portion of the field, but we shall have to take our\nchances with the fringe.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Kincaide, without lifting his eyes from the chart.\nHis voice was calm and businesslike, now; with the responsibility on\nmy shoulders, as commander, he was the efficient, level-headed\nthinking machine that had endeared him to me as both fellow-officer\nand friend.\n\nLeaving the charts to Kincaide, I sounded the general emergency\nsignal, calling every man and officer of the _Ertak's_ crew to his\npost, and began giving orders through the microphone.\n\n\"Mr. Correy,\"--Correy was my first officer--\"please report at once to\nthe navigating room. Mr. Hendricks, make the rounds of all duty posts,\nplease, and give special attention to the disintegrator ray operators.\nThe ray generators are to be started at once, full speed.\" Hendricks,\nI might say, was a junior officer, and a very good one, although\nquick-tempered and excitable--failings of youth. He had only recently\nshipped with us to replace Anderson Croy, who--but that has already\nbeen recorded.[2]\n\n[Footnote 2: \"The Dark Side of Antri,\" in the January, 1931, issue of\nAstounding Stories.]\n\nThese preparations made, I glanced at the twin charts again. The\npeppering of tiny green lights, each of which represented a meteoritic\nbody, had definitely shifted in relation to the position of the\nstrongly-glowing red spark that was the _Ertak_, but a quick\ncomparison of the two charts showed that we would be certain to pass\nthrough--again I use land terms to make my meaning clear--the upper\nright fringe of the field.\n\nThe great cluster of meteorites was moving in the same direction as\nourselves now; Kincaide's change of course had settled that matter\nnicely. Naturally, this was the logical course, since should we come\nin contact with any of them, the impact would bear a relation to only\nthe _difference_ in our speeds, instead of the _sum_, as would be the\ncase if we struck at a wide angle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was difficult to stand without grasping a support of some kind, and\nwalking was almost impossible, for the reduction of our tremendous\nspeed, and even the slightest change of direction, placed terrific\nstrains upon the ship and everything in it. Space ships, at space\nspeeds, must travel like the old-fashioned bullets if those within are\nto feel at ease.\n\n\"I believe, Mr. Kincaide, it might be well to slightly increase the\npower in the gravity pads,\" I suggested. Kincaide nodded and spoke\nbriefly into his microphone; an instant later I felt my weight\nincrease perhaps fifty per cent, and despite the inertia of my body,\nopposed to both the change in speed and direction of the _Ertak_, I\ncould now stand without support, and could walk without too much\ndifficulty.\n\nThe door of the navigating room was flung open, and Correy entered,\nhis face alight with curiosity and eagerness. An emergency meant\ndanger, and few beings in the universe have loved danger more than\nCorrey.\n\n\"We're in for it, Mr. Correy,\" I said, with a nod towards the charts.\n\"Swarm of meteorites, and we can't avoid them.\"\n\n\"Well, we've dodged through them before, sir,\" smiled Correy. \"We can\ndo it again.\"\n\n\"I hope so, but this is the largest field of them I have ever seen.\nLook at the charts: they're thicker than flies.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCorrey glanced at the charts, slapped Kincaide across his bowed, tense\nshoulders, and laughed aloud.\n\n\"Trust the old _Ertak_ to worm her way through, sir,\" he said. \"The\nray crews are on duty, I presume?\"\n\n\"Yes. But I doubt that the rays will be of much assistance to us.\nParticularly if these are stony meteorites--and as you know, the odds\nare about ten to one against their being of ferrous composition. The\nrays, deducting the losses due to the utter lack of a conducting\nmedium, will be insufficient protection. They will help, of course.\nThe iron meteorites they will take care of effectively, but the\nconglomerate nature of the stony meteorites does not make them\nparticularly susceptible to the disintegrating rays.\n\n\"We shall do what we can, but our success will depend largely upon\ngood luck--or Divine Providence.\"\n\n\"At any rate, sir,\" replied Correy, and his voice had lost some of its\nlightness, \"we are upon routine patrol and not upon special mission.\nIf we do crack up, there is no emergency call that will remain\nunanswered.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said dryly. \"There will be just another 'Lost in Space' report\nin the records of the Service, and the _Ertak's_ name will go up on\nthe tablet of lost ships. In any case, we have done and shall do what\nwe can. In ten minutes we shall know all there is to know. That about\nright, Mr. Kincaide?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes?\" Kincaide studied the charts with narrowed eyes,\nmentally balancing distance and speed. \"We should be within the danger\narea in about that length of time, sir,\" he answered. \"And out of\nit--if we come out--three or four minutes later.\"\n\n\"We'll come out of it,\" said Correy positively.\n\nI walked heavily across the room and studied the charts again. Space\nabove and below, to the right and the left of us, was powdered with\nthe green points of light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCorrey joined me, his feet thumping with the unaccustomed weight given\nhim by the increase in gravity. As he bent over the charts, I heard\nhim draw in his breath sharply.\n\nKincaide looked up. Correy looked up. I looked up. The glance of each\nman swept the faces, read the eyes, of the other two. Then, with one\naccord, we all three glanced up at the clocks--more properly, at the\ntwelve-figured dial of the Earth clock, for none of us had any great\nlove for the metric Universal system of time-keeping.\n\nTen minutes.... Less than that, now.\n\n\"Mr. Correy,\" I said, as calmly as I could, \"you will relieve Mr.\nKincaide as navigating officer. Mr. Kincaide, present my compliments\nto Mr. Hendricks, and ask him to explain the situation to the crew.\nYou will instruct the disintegrator ray operators in their duties, and\ntake charge of their activities. Start operation at your discretion;\nyou understand the necessity.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Kincaide saluted sharply, and I returned his salute. We\ndid not shake hands, the Earth gesture of--strangely enough--both\ngreeting and farewell, but we both realized that this might well be a\nfinal parting. The door closed behind him, and Correy and I were left\ntogether to watch the creeping hands of the Earth clock, the twin\ncharts with their thick spatter of green lights, and the two fiery red\nsparks, one on each chart, that represented the _Ertak_ sweeping\nrecklessly towards the swarming danger ahead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn other accounts of my experiences in the Special Patrol Service I\nfeel that I have written too much about myself. After all, I have run\nmy race; a retired commander of the Service, and an old, old man, with\nthe century mark well behind me, my only use is to record, in this\nfashion, some of those things the Service accomplished in the old days\nwhen the worlds of the Universe were strange to each other, and space\ntravel was still an adventure to many.\n\nThe Universe is not interested in old men; it is concerned only with\nyouth and action. It forgets that once we were young men, strong,\nimpetuous, daring. It forgets what we did; but that has always been\nso. It always will be so. John Hanson, retired Commander of the\nSpecial Patrol Service, is fit only to amuse the present generation\nwith his tales of bygone days.\n\nWell, so be it. I am content. I have lived greatly; certainly I would\nnot exchange my memories of those bold, daring days even for youth and\nstrength again, had I to live that youth and waste that strength in\nthis softened, gilded age.\n\nBut no more of this; it is too easy for an old man to rumble on about\nhimself. It is only the young John Hanson, Commander of the _Ertak_,\nwho can interest those who may pick up and read what I am writing\nhere.\n\nI did not waste the minutes measured by that clock, grouped with our\nother instruments in the navigating room of the _Ertak_. I wrote\nhastily in the ship's log, stating the facts briefly and without\nfeeling. If we came through, the log would read better thus; if not,\nand by some strange chance it came to human eyes, then the Universe\nwould know at least that the _Ertak's_ officers did not flinch from\neven such a danger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I finished the entry, Correy spoke:\n\n\"Kincaide's estimate was not far off, sir,\" he said, with a swift\nglance at the clock. \"Here we go!\" It was less than half a minute\nshort of the ten estimated by Kincaide.\n\nI nodded and bent over the television disc--one of the huge, hooded\naffairs we used in those days. Widening the field to the greatest\nangle, and with low power, I inspected the space before us on all\nsides.\n\nThe charts, operated by super-radio reflexes, had not lied about the\ndanger into which we were passing--had passed. We were in the midst of\na veritable swarm of meteorites of all sizes.\n\nThey were not large; I believe the largest I saw had a mass of not\nmore than three or four times that of the _Ertak_ herself. Some of the\nsmaller bodies were only fifty or sixty feet in diameter.\n\nThey were jagged and irregular in shape, and they seemed to spin at\nvarying speeds, like tiny worlds.\n\nAs I watched, fixing my view now on the space directly in our path, I\nsaw that our disintegrator ray men were at work. Deep in the bowels of\nthe _Ertak_, the moan of the ray generators had deepened in note; I\ncould even feel the slight vibration beneath my feet.\n\nOne of the meteorites slowly crumbled on top, the dust of\ndisintegration hovering in a compact mass about the body. More and\nmore of it melted away. The spinning motion grew irregular, eccentric,\nas the center of gravity was changed by the action of the ray.\n\nAnother ray, two more, centered on the wobbling mass. It was directly\nin our path, looming up larger and larger every second.\n\nFaster and faster it melted, the rays eating into it from four sides.\nBut it was perilously near now; I had to reduce power in order to keep\nall of it within the field of my disc. If--\n\nThe thing vanished before the very nose of the ship, not an instant\ntoo soon. I glanced up at the surface temperature indicator, and saw\nthe big black hand move slowly for a degree or two, and stop. It was a\nvery sensitive instrument, and registered even the slight friction of\nour passage through the disintegrated dust of the meteorite.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur rays were working desperately, but disintegrator rays are not\nnearly so effective in space as in an atmosphere of some kind. Half a\ndozen times it seemed that we must crash head on into one of the\nflying bodies, but our speed was reduced now to such an extent that we\nwere going but little faster than the meteorites, and this fact was\nall that saved us. We had more time for utilizing our rays.\n\nWe nosed upward through the trailing fringe of the swarm in safety.\nThe great field of meteorites was now below and ahead of us. We had\nwon through! The _Ertak_ was safe, and--\n\n\"There seems to be another directly above us, sir,\" commented Correy\nquietly, speaking for the first time since we had entered the area of\ndanger. \"I believe your disc is not picking it up.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Correy,\" I said. While operating on an entirely\ndifferent principle, his two charts had certain very definite\nadvantages: they showed the entire space around us, instead of but a\nportion.\n\nI picked up the meteorite he had mentioned without difficulty. It was\na large body, about three times the mass of the _Ertak_, and some\ndistance above us--a laggard in the group we had just eluded.\n\n\"Will it coincide with our path at any point, Mr. Correy?\" I asked\ndoubtfully. The television disc could not, of course, give me this\ninformation.\n\n\"I believe so; yes,\" replied Correy, frowning over his charts. \"Are\nthe rays on it, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes. All of them, I judge, but they are making slow work of it.\" I\nfell silent, bending lower over the great hooded disc.\n\nThere were a dozen, a score of rays playing upon the surface of the\nmeteorite. A halo of dust hung around the rapidly diminishing body,\nbut still the mass melted all too slowly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPressing the attention signal for Kincaide, I spoke sharply into the\nmicrophone:\n\n\"Mr. Kincaide, is every ray on that large meteorite above us?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied instantly.\n\n\"Full power?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well; carry on, Mr. Kincaide.\" I turned to Correy; he had just\nglanced from his charts to the clock, with its jerking second hand,\nand back to his charts.\n\n\"They'll have to do it in the next ten seconds, sir,\" he said.\n\"Otherwise--\" Correy shrugged, and his eyes fixed with a peculiar,\nfascinated stare on the charts. He was looking death squarely in the\neyes.\n\nTen seconds! It was not enough. I had watched the rays working, and I\nknew their power to disintegrate this death-dealing stone that was\nhurtling along above us while we rose, helplessly, into its path.\n\nI did not ask Correy if it was possible to alter the course enough,\nand quickly enough, to avoid that fateful path. Had it been possible\nwithout tearing the _Ertak_ to pieces with the strain of it, Correy\nwould have done it seconds ago.\n\nI glanced up swiftly at the relentless, jerking second hand. Seven\nseconds gone! Three seconds more.\n\nThe rays were doing all that could be expected of them. There was only\na tiny fragment of the meteorite left, and it was dwindling swiftly.\nBut our time was passing even more rapidly.\n\nThe bit of rock loomed up at me from the disc. It seemed to fly up\ninto my face, to meet me.\n\n\"Got us, Correy!\" I said hoarsely. \"Good-by, old-man!\"\n\nI think he tried to reply. I saw his lips open; the flash of the\nbright light from the ethon tubes on his big white teeth.\n\nThen there was a crash that shook the whole ship. I shot into the air.\nI remember falling ... terribly.\n\nA blinding flash of light that emanated from the very center of my\nbrain, a sickening sense of utter catastrophe, and ... blackness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI think I was conscious several seconds before I finally opened my\neyes. My mind was still wandering; my thoughts kept flying around in\nhuge circles that kept closing in.\n\nWe had hit the meteorite. I remembered the crash. I remembered\nfalling. I remembered striking my head.\n\nBut I was still alive. There was air to breathe and there was firm\nmaterial under me. I opened my eyes.\n\nFor the first instant, it seemed I was in an utterly strange room.\nNothing was familiar. Everything was--was _inverted_. Then I glanced\nupward, and I saw what had happened.\n\nI was lying on the ceiling of the navigating room. Over my head were\nthe charts, still glowing, the chronometers in their gimballed beds,\nand the television disc. Beside me, sprawled out limply, was Correy, a\ntrickle of dried blood on his cheek. A litter of papers, chairs,\nframed licenses and other movable objects were strewn on and around\nus.\n\nMy first instinctive, foolish thought was that the ship was upside\ndown. Man has a ground-trained mind, no matter how many years he may\ntravel space. Then, of course, I realized that in the open void there\nis not top nor bottom; the illusion is supplied, in space ships, by\nthe gravity pads. Somehow, the shock of impact had reversed the\npolarity of the leads to the pads, and they had become repulsion pads.\nThat was why I had dropped from the floor to the ceiling.\n\nAll this flashed through my mind in an instant as I dragged myself\ntoward Correy. Dragged myself because my head was throbbing so that I\ndared not stand up, and one shoulder, my left, was numb.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an instant I thought that Correy was dead. Then, as I bent over\nhim, I saw a pulse leaping just under the angle of his jaw.\n\n\"Correy, old man!\" I whispered. \"Do you hear me?\" All the formality of\nthe Service was forgotten for the time. \"Are you hurt badly?\"\n\nHis eyelids flickered, and he sighed; then, suddenly, he looked up at\nme--and smiled!\n\n\"We're still here, sir?\"\n\n\"After a fashion. Look around; see what's happened?\"\n\nHe glanced about curiously, frowning. His wits were not all with him\nyet.\n\n\"We're in a mess, aren't we?\" he grinned. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nI told him what I thought, and he nodded slowly, feeling his head\ntenderly.\n\n\"How long ago did it happen?\" he asked. \"The blooming clock's upside\ndown; can you read it?\"\n\nI could--with an effort.\n\n\"Over twenty minutes,\" I said. \"I wonder how the rest of the men are?\"\n\nWith an effort, I got to my feet and peered into the operating room.\nSeveral of the men were moving about, dazedly, and as I signalled to\nthem, reassuringly, a voice hailed us from the doorway:\n\n\"Any orders, sir?\"\n\nIt was Kincaide. He was peering over what had been the top of the\ndoorway, and he was probably the most disreputable-looking officer who\nhad ever worn the blue-and-silver uniform of the Service. His nose was\nbloody and swollen to twice its normal size. Both eyes were blackened,\nand his hair, matted with blood, was plastered in ragged swirls across\nhis forehead.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Kincaide; plenty of them. Round up enough of the men to\nlocate the trouble with the gravity pads; there's a reversed\nconnection somewhere. But don't let them make the repairs until the\nsignal is given. Otherwise, we'll all fall on our heads again. Mr.\nCorrey and I will take care of the injured.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next half hour was a trying one. Two men had been killed outright,\nand another died before we could do anything to save him. Every man in\nthe crew was shaken up and bruised, but by the time the check was\ncompleted, we had a good half of our personnel on duty.\n\nReturning at last to the navigating room, I pressed the attention\nsignal for Kincaide, and got his answer immediately.\n\n\"Located the trouble yet, Mr. Kincaide?\" I asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, sir! Mr. Hendricks has been working with a group of men and has\njust made his report. They are ready when you are.\"\n\n\"Good!\" I drew a sigh of relief. It had been easier than I thought.\nPressing the general attention signal, I broadcasted the warning,\ngiving particular instructions to the men in charge of the injured.\nThen I issued orders to Hendricks:\n\n\"Reverse the current in five seconds, Mr. Hendricks, and stand by for\nfurther instructions.\"\n\nHastily, then, Correy and I followed the orders we had given the men.\nBriefly we stood on our heads against the wall, feeling very foolish,\nand dreading the fall we knew was coming.\n\nIt came. We slid down the wall and lit heavily on our feet, while the\nlitter that had been on the ceiling with us fell all around us.\nMiraculously, the ship seemed to have righted herself. Correy and I\npicked ourselves up and looked around.\n\n\"We're still operating smoothly,\" I commented with a sweeping glance\nat the instruments over the operating table. \"Everything seems in\norder.\"\n\n\"Did you notice the speed indicator, sir?\" asked Correy grimly. \"When\nhe fell, one of the men in the operating room must have pulled the\nspeed lever all the way over. We're at maximum space speed, sir, and\nhave been for nearly an hour, with no one at the controls.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe stared at each other dully. Nearly an hour, at maximum space\nspeed--a speed seldom used except in case of great emergency. With no\none at the controls, and the ship set at maximum deflection from her\ncourse.\n\nThat meant that for nearly an hour we had been sweeping into infinite\nspace in a great arc, at a speed I disliked to think about.\n\n\"I'll work out our position at once,\" I said, \"and in the meantime,\nreduce speed to normal as quickly as possible. We must get back on our\ncourse at the earliest possible moment.\"\n\nWe hurried across to the charts that were our most important aides in\nproper navigation. By comparing the groups of stars there with our\nspace charts of the universe, the working out of our position was\nordinarily, a simple matter.\n\nBut now, instead of milky rectangles, ruled with fine black lines,\nwith a fiery red speck in the center and the bodies of the universe\ngrouped around in green points of light, there were only nearly blank\nrectangles, shot through with vague, flickering lights that revealed\nnothing except the presence of disaster.\n\n\"The meteoric fragment wiped out some of our plates, I imagine,\" said\nCorrey slowly. \"The thing's useless.\"\n\nI nodded, staring down at the crawling lights on the charts.\n\n\"We'll have to set down for repairs, Mr. Correy. If,\" I added, \"we can\nfind a place.\"\n\nCorrey glanced up at the attraction meter.\n\n\"I'll take a look in the big disc,\" he suggested. \"There's a sizeable\nbody off to port. Perhaps our luck's changed.\"\n\nHe bent his head under the big hood, adjusting the controls until he\nlocated the source of the registered attraction.\n\n\"Right!\" he said, after a moment's careful scrutiny. \"She's as big as\nEarth, I'd venture, and I believe I can detect clouds, so there should\nbe atmosphere. Shall we try it, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes. We're helpless until we make repairs. As big as Earth, you said?\nIs she familiar?\"\n\nCorrey studied the image under the hood again, long and carefully.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said, looking up and shaking his head. \"She's a new one\non me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConning the ship first by means of the television disc, and navigating\nvisually as we neared the strange sphere, we were soon close enough to\nmake out the physical characteristics of this unknown world.\n\nOur spectroscopic tests had revealed the presence of atmosphere\nsuitable for breathing, although strongly laden with mineral fumes\nwhich, while possibly objectionable, would probably not be dangerous.\n\nSo far as we could see, there was but one continent, somewhat north of\nthe equator, roughly triangular in shape, with its northernmost point\nreaching nearly to the Pole.\n\n\"It's an unexplored world, sir. I'm certain of that,\" said Correy. \"I\nam sure I would have remembered that single, triangular continent had\nI seen it on any of our charts.\" In those days, of course, the\nUniverse was by no means so well mapped as it is today.\n\n\"If not unknown, it is at least uncharted,\" I replied. \"Rough looking\ncountry, isn't it? No sign of life, either, that the disc will\nreveal.\"\n\n\"That's as well, sir. Better no people than wild natives who might\ninterfere with our work. Any choice in the matter of a spot on which\nto set her down?\"\n\nI inspected the great, triangular continent carefully. Towards the\nnorth it was a mass of snow covered mountains, some of them, from\ntheir craters, dead volcanoes. Long spurs of these ranges reached\nsouthward, with green and apparently fertile valleys between. The\nsouthern edge was covered with dense tropical vegetation; a veritable\njungle.\n\n\"At the base of that central spur there seems to be a sort of\nplateau,\" I suggested. \"I believe that would be a likely spot.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Correy, and the old _Ertak_, reduced to\natmospheric speed, swiftly swept toward the indicated position, while\nCorrey kept a wary eye on the surface temperature gauge, and I swept\nthe terrain for any sign of intelligent life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found a number of trails, particularly around the base of the\nfoothills, but they were evidently game trails, for there were no\ndwelling places of any kind; no cities, no villages, not even a single\nhabitation of any kind that the searching eyes of the disc could\ndetect.\n\nCorrey set her down as neatly and as softly as a rose petal drifts to\nthe ground. Roses, I may add, are a beautiful and delicate flower,\nwith very soft petals, peculiar to my native Earth.\n\nWe opened the main exit immediately. I watched the huge, circular door\nback slowly out of its threads, and finally swing aside, swiftly and\nsilently, in the grip of its mighty gimbals, with the weird,\nunearthly feeling I have always had when about to step foot on some\nstrange star where no man has trod before.\n\nThe air was sweet, and delightfully fresh after being cooped up for\nweeks in the _Ertak_, with her machine-made air. A little thinner, I\nshould judge, than the air to which we were accustomed, but strangely\nexhilarating, and laden with a faint scent of some unknown\nconstituent--undoubtedly the mineral element our spectroscope had\nrevealed but not identified. Gravity, I found upon passing through the\nexit, was normal. Altogether an extremely satisfactory repair station.\n\nCorrey's guess as to what had happened proved absolutely accurate.\nAlong the top of the _Ertak_, from amidships to within a few feet of\nher pointed stem, was a jagged groove that had destroyed hundreds of\nthe bright, coppery discs, set into the outer skin of the ship, that\noperated our super-radio reflex charts. The groove was so deep, in\nplaces, that it must have bent the outer skin of the _Ertak_ down\nagainst the inner skin. A foot or more--it was best not to think of\nwhat would have happened then.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the time we completed our inspection dusk was upon us--a long,\nlingering dusk, due, no doubt, to the afterglow resulting from the\nmineral content of the air. I'm no white-skinned, stoop-shouldered\nlaboratory man, so I'm not sure that was the real reason. It sounds\nlogical, however.\n\n\"Mr. Correy, I think we shall break out our field equipment and give\nall men not on watch an opportunity to sleep out in the fresh air,\" I\nsaid. \"Will you give the orders, please?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Mr. Hendricks will stand the eight to twelve watch as\nusual?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Mr. Kincaide will relieve him at midnight, and you will take over at\nfour.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\" Correy turned to give the orders, and in a few\nminutes an orderly array of shelter tents made a single street in\nfront of the fat, dully-gleaming side of the _Ertak_. Our tents were\nat the head of this short company street, three of them in a little\nrow.\n\nAfter the evening meal, cooked over open fires, with the smoke of the\nvery resinous wood we had collected hanging comfortably in the still\nair, the men gave themselves up to boisterous, noisy games, which, I\nconfess, I should have liked very much to participate in. They raced\nand tumbled around the two big fires like schoolboys on a lark. Only\nthose who have spent most of their days in the metal belly of a space\nship know the sheer joy of utter physical freedom.\n\nCorrey, Kincaide and I sat before our tents and watched them, chatting\nabout this and that--I have long since forgotten what. But I shall\nnever forget what occurred just before the watch changed that night.\nNor will any man of the _Ertak's_ crew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was just a few minutes before midnight. The men had quieted down\nand were preparing to turn in. I had given orders that this first\nnight they could suit themselves about retiring; a good officer, and I\ntried to be one, is never afraid to give good men a little rein, now\nand then.\n\nThe fires had died down to great heaps of red coals, filmed with\nashes, and, aside from the brilliant galaxy of stars overhead, there\nwas no light from above. Either this world had no moons, not even a\nsingle moon, like my native Earth, or it had not yet arisen.\n\nKincaide rose lazily, stretched himself, and glanced at his watch.\n\n\"Seven till twelve, sir,\" he said. \"I believe I'll run along and\nrelieve--\"\n\nHe never finished that sentence. From somewhere there came a rushing\nsound, and a damp, stringy net, a living, horrible, _something_,\ndescended upon us out of the night.\n\nIn an instant, what had been an orderly encampment became a bedlam. I\ntried to fight against the stringy, animated, nearly intangible mass,\nor masses, that held me, but my arms, my legs, my whole body, was\nbound as with strings and loops of elastic bands.\n\nStrange whispering sounds filled the air, audible above the shouting\nof the men. The net about me grew tighter; I felt myself being lifted\nfrom the ground. Others were being treated the same way; one of the\n_Ertak's_ crew shot straight up, not a dozen feet away, writhing and\nsquirming. Then, at an elevation of perhaps twice my height, he was\nhurried away.\n\nHendrick's voice called out my name from the _Ertak's_ exit, and I\nshouted a warning:\n\n\"Hendrick! Go back! Close the emergency--\" Then a gluey mass cut\nacross my mouth, and, as though carried on huge soft springs, I was\nhurried away, with the sibilant, whispering sounds louder and closer\nthan ever. With me, as nearly as I could judge, went every man who had\nnot been on duty in the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI ceased struggling, and immediately the rubbery network about me\nloosened. It seemed to me that the whisperings about me were suddenly\napproving. We were in the grip, then, of some sort of intelligent\nbeings, ghost-like and invisible though they were.\n\nAfter a time, during which we were all, in a ragged group, being borne\nswiftly towards the mountains, all at a common level from the ground,\nI managed to turn my head so that I could see, against the star-lit\nsky, something of the nature of the things that had made us captive.\n\nAs is not infrequently the case, in trying to describe things of an\nutterly different world, I find myself at a loss for words. I think of\njellyfish, such as inhabit the seas of most of the inhabited planets,\nand yet this is not a good description.\n\nThese creatures were pale, and almost completely transparent. What\ntheir forms might be, I could not even guess. I could make out\nwrithing, tentacle-like arms, and wrinkled, flabby excrudescences and\nthat was all. That these creatures were huge, was evident from the\nfact that they, apparently walking, from the irregular, undulating\nmotion, held us easily ten or a dozen feet from the ground.\n\nWith the release of the pressure about my body I was able to talk\nagain, and I called out to Correy, who was fighting his way along,\nmuttering, angrily, just ahead of me.\n\n\"Correy! No use fighting them. Save your strength, man!\"\n\n\"Then? What are they, in God's name? What spawn of hell--\"\n\n\"The Commander is right, Correy,\" interrupted Kincaide, who was not\nfar from my first officer. \"Let's get our breaths and try to figure\nout what's happened. I'm winded!\" His voice gave plentiful evidence of\nthe struggle he had put up.\n\n\"I want to know where I'm going, and why!\" growled Correy, ceasing his\nstruggling, nevertheless. \"What have us? Are they fish or flesh or\nfowl?\"\n\n\"I think we shall know before very long, Correy,\" I replied. \"Look\nahead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bearers of the men in the fore part of the group had apparently\nstopped before a shadowy wall, like the face of a cliff. Rapidly, the\nrest of us were brought up, until we were in a compact group, some in\nsitting positions, some upside down, the majority reclining on back or\nside. The whispering sound now was intense and excited, as though our\nstrange bearers awaited some momentous happening.\n\nI took advantage of the opportunity to speak very briefly to my\ncompanions.\n\n\"Men, I'll admit frankly that I don't know what we're up against,\" I\nsaid. \"But I do know this: we'll come out on top of the heap. Conserve\nyour strength, keep your eyes open, and be prepared to obey,\ninstantly, any orders that may be issued: I know that last remark is\nnot needed. If any of you should see or learn something of interest or\nvalue, report at once to Mr. Correy, Mr. Kincaide or my--\"\n\nA simultaneous, involuntary exclamation from the men interrupted me,\nand it was not surprising that this was so, for the wall before us had\nsuddenly opened, and there was a great burst of yellow light in our\nfaces. A strong odor, like the faint scent we had first noticed in the\nair, but infinitely more powerful, struck our nostrils, but I was not\nconscious of the fact for several seconds. My whole attention, my\nevery startled thought, was focused upon the group of strange beings,\nsilhouetted against the glowing light, that stood in the opening.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nImagine, if you can, a huge globe, perhaps eight feet in diameter,\nflattened slightly at the bottom, and supported on six short, huge\nstumps, like the feet of an elephant, and topped by an excrudescence\nlike a rounded coning tower, merging into the globular body. From\npoints slightly below this excrudescence, visualize six long, limp\ntentacles, so long that they drop from the equators of these animated\nspheres, and trail on the ground. Now you have some conception of the\nbeings that stood before us.\n\nA sharp, sibilant whispering came from one of these figures, to be\nanswered in an eager chorus from our bearers. There was a reply like a\ncommand, and the group in the doorway marched forward. One by one\nthese visible tentacles wrapped themselves around a member of the\n_Ertak's_ crew, each one of the globular creatures bearing one of us.\n\nI heard a disappointed whisper go up from the outer darkness where,\nbut a moment before, we had been. Then there was a grating sound, and\na thud as the stone doorway was rolled back into place.\n\nThe entrance was sealed. We were prisoners indeed!\n\n\"All right, now what?\" gritted Correy. \"God! If I ever get a hand\nloose!\"\n\nSwiftly, each of us held above the head-like excrudescence atop the\nglobular body of the thing that held us, we were carried down a\nwidening rocky corridor, towards the source of the yellow light that\nbeat about us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe passage led to a great cavern, irregular in shape, and apparently\npossessed of numerous other outlets which converged here.\n\nI am not certain as to the size of the cavern, save that it was great,\nand that the roof was so high in most sections that it was lost in\nshadow.\n\nThe great cavern was nearly filled with creatures similar to those\nwhich were bearing us, and they fell back in orderly passage to permit\nour conductors to pass.\n\nI could see, now, that the hump atop each rounded body was a travesty\nof a head, hairless, and without a neck. Their features were\nparticularly hideous, and I shall pass over a description as rapidly\nas possible.\n\nThe eyes were round, and apparently lidless; a pale drab or bluff in\ncolor. Instead of a nose, as, we understand the term, they had a\nconvoluted rosette in the center of the face, not unlike the olfactory\norgan of a bat. Their ears were placed as are ours, but were of thin,\npale parchment, and hugged the side of the head tightly. Instead of a\nmouth, there was a slightly depressed oval of fluttering skin near the\npoint where the head melted into the rounded body: the rapid\nfluttering or vibration of this skin produced the whispering sound I\nhave already remarked.\n\nThe cavern, as I have said, was flooded with yellow light, which came\nfrom a great column of fire near the center of the clear space. I had\nno opportunity to inspect the exact arrangements but from what I did\nsee, I judged that this flame was fed by some sort of highly\ninflammable substance, not unlike crude oil, except that it burned\nclearly and without smoke. This substance was conducted to the font\nfrom which the flame leaped by means of a large pipe of hollow reed or\nwood.\n\nAt the far end of the cavern a procession entered from one of the\npassages--nine figures similar to those which bore us, save that by\nthe greater darkness of their skin, and the wrinkles upon both face\nand body, I judged these to be older than the rest. From the respect\nwith which they were treated, and the dignity of their movements, I\ngathered that these were persons of authority, a surmise which quickly\nverified itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese nine elders arranged themselves, standing, in the form of a\nsemicircle, the center creature standing a pace or two in front of the\nothers. At a whispered command, we were all dumped unceremoniously on\nthe floor of the cavern before this august council of nine.\n\nNine pairs of fish-like, unblinking eyes inspected us, whether with\nenmity or otherwise; I could not determine. One of the nine spoke\nbriefly to one of our conductors, and received an even more brief\nreply.\n\nI felt the gaze of the creature in the center fix on me. I had taken\nmy proper position in front of my men; he apparently recognized me as\nthe leader of the group.\n\nIn a sharp whisper, he addressed me; I gathered from the tone that he\nuttered a command, but I could only shake my head in response. No\nwords could convey thought from his mind to mine--but we did have a\nmeans of communication at hand.\n\n\"Mr. Correy,\" I said, \"your menore, please!\" I released my own from\nthe belt which held it, along with the other expeditionary equipment\nwhich we always wore when outside our ship, and placed it in position\nupon my head, motioning for one of the nine to do likewise with\nCorrey's menore.\n\nThey watched me suspiciously, despite my attempt to convey, by gestures,\nthat by means of these instruments we could convey thoughts to each other.\nThe menores of those days were bulky, heavy things, and undoubtedly they\nlooked dangerous to these creatures: thought-transference instruments at\nthat time were complicated affairs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHowever, I must have made myself partially understood, at least, for\nthe chief of the nine uttered a whispered command to one of the beings\nwho had borne us to the large cavern, and motioned with a writhing\ngesture of one tentacle that I was to place the menore upon this\ncreature's head.\n\n\"The old boy's playing it safe, sir,\" muttered Correy, chuckling.\n\"Wants to try it out on the dog first.\"\n\n\"Right!\" I nodded, and, not without difficulty, placed the other\nmenore upon the rounded dome of the individual selected for the trial.\n\nBoth instruments were adjusted to full power, and I concentrated my\nmental energy upon the simple pictures that I thought I could convey\nto the limited mentality of which I suspected these creatures,\nwatching his fishy eyes the while.\n\nIt was several seconds before he realized what was happening; then he\nbegan talking excitedly to the waiting nine. The words fairly burned\nthemselves in my consciousness, but of course were utterly\nunintelligible to me. Before the creature had finished, a lash-like\ntentacle shot out from the chief of the nine and removed the menore; a\nmoment later it reposed, at a rather rakish slant, on the shining dome\nof its new possessor.\n\n\"Get anything, sir?\" asked Correy in a low voice.\n\n\"Not yet. I'm trying to make him see how we came here, and that we're\nfriends. Then I'll see what I can get out of him; he'll have to get\nthe idea of coming back at me with pictures instead of words, and it\nmay take a long time to make him understand.\"\n\nIt did take a long time. I could feel the sweat trickling down my face\nas I strove to make him understand. His eyes revealed wonderment and a\nlittle fear, but an almost utter lack of understanding.\n\nI pictured for him the heavens, and our ship sailing along through\nspace. Then I showed him the _Ertak_ coming to rest on the plateau,\nand he made little impatient noises as though to convey that he knew\nall about that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a long time he got the idea. Crudely, dimly, he pictured the\n_Ertak_ leaving this strange world, and soaring off into vacant space.\nThen his scene faded out, and he pictured the same thing again, as one\nmight repeat a question not understood. He wanted to know where we\nwould go if we left this world of his.\n\nI pictured for him other worlds, peopled with men more or less like\nmyself. I showed him the great cities, and the fleets of ships like\nthe _Ertak_ that plied between them. Then, as best I could, I asked\nhim about himself and his people.\n\nIt came to me jerkily and poorly pictured, but I managed to piece out\nthe story. Whether I guess correctly on all points, I am not sure, nor\nwill I ever be sure. But this is the story as I got it.\n\nThese people at one time lived in the open, and all the people of this\nworld were like those in the cavern, possessed of opaque bodies and\ngreat strength. There were none of the ghost-like creatures who had\ncaptured us.\n\nBut after a long time, a ruling class arose. They tried to dominate\nthe masses, and the masses refused to be dominated. But the ruling\nclasses were wise, and versed in certain sciences; the masses were\nignorant. So the ruling classes devised a plan.\n\nThese creatures did not eat. There was a tradition that at one time\nthey had had mouths, as I had, but that was not known. Their strength,\ntheir vitality, came from the powerful mineral vapor which came forth\nfrom the bowels of the earth. The ruling classes decided that if they\ncould control the supply of this vapor, they would have the whip hand,\nand they set about realizing this condition.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was quickly done. All the sources of supply, save one, were sealed.\nThis one source of supply was the cavern in which we stood. These were\nmembers of the ruling class, and outside was the rabble, starved and\nunhappy, living on the faint seepage of the vital fumes, without which\nthey became almost bodiless, and the helpless slaves of those within\nthe cavern.\n\nThese creatures, then, were boneless; as boneless as sponges, and,\nlike sponges, capable of absorbing huge quantities of a foreign\nsubstance, which distended them and gave them weight. I could see,\nnow, why the rotund bodies sagged and flattened at the base, and why\nsix short, stubby legs were needed to support that body. There was\nonly tissue, unsupported by bone, to bear the weight!\n\nThis chief of the nine went on to show me how ruthlessly, how cruelly\nthose within the cavern ruled those without. The substance that fed\nthe flame had to be gathered and a great reservoir on the side of the\nmountain kept filled. Great masses of dry, sweet grass, often changed,\nmust be harvested and brought to the entrance of the cavern, for\nbedding. A score of other tasks kept the outsiders busy always--and\nthe driving force was that, did the slaves become disobedient, the\nslight supply of mineral vapor available in the outside world would be\ncut off utterly, and all outside would surely die, slowly and in\nagony.\n\nThose within the cavern were the rulers. They would always remain the\nrulers, and those outside would remain the slaves to wait upon them.\nAnd we--how strangely he pictured us, as he saw us!--were not to\nreturn to our queer worlds, that we might bring many other ships like\nthe _Ertak_ back to interfere. No.\n\nThe pupils of his eyes contracted, and the leafy structure of his nose\nfluttered as though with strong emotion.\n\nNo, we would not go back. He would give a signal to those of his\ncreatures who stood behind us--a sort of soldiery, I gathered--and our\nheads, our legs, our arms, would be torn from our bodies. Then we\nwould not go back to bring--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was enough for me.\n\n\"Men!\" I spoke softly, but with an intensity that gave me their\ninstant attention, \"it's going to be a fight for life. When I give the\nsignal, make a rush for the entrance by which we came in. I'll lead\nthe way. Use your pistols, and your bombs if necessary. All\nright--forward!\"\n\nCorrey's great shout rang out after mine, and I flung my menore in the\nface of the nearest guard. It bounced off as though it had struck a\nrubber ball. Behind me, one of the men called out sharply; I heard a\nsharp crunch of bone, and with a pang realized that the _Ertak's_ log\nwould have at least one death to record.\n\nA dozen tentacles lashed out at me, and I sprayed their owners with\npellets from my atomic pistol. The air was filled with the shouts of\nmy men and the whispers of our enemies. All around me I could hear the\nscreaming of ricochets from our pistols. Twice atomic bombs exploded\nnot far away, and the solid rock shook beneath my feet. Something shot\nby close to my face; an instant later a limp bundle in the blue and\nsilver uniform of our Service struck the rock wall of the cavern,\nthirty feet away. The strength in those rubbery tentacles was\nterrible.\n\nThe pistols seemed to have but little effect. They wounded, but they\ndid not kill unless the pellet struck the head. Then the victim\nrolled over, rocking idiotically on its middle.\n\n\"In the head, men!\" I shouted. \"That downs them! And keep the bombs in\naction. Throw them against the walls of the cavern. Take a chance!\"\n\nA ragged cheer went up, and I heard Correy's voice raised in angry\nconversation with the enemy:\n\n\"You will, eh? There!... Now!... Ah!--right--through--the--eye.\nThat's--the place!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA score of times I was grasped and held by the writhing arms of the\nangry horde whispering all around me. Each time I literally shot the\ntentacle away with my atomic pistol, leaving the severed end to unwrap\nitself and drop from my struggling body. The things had no blood in\nthem.\n\nSteadily, we fought our way toward the doorway, out of the cavern,\ndown the passageway, pressed into a compact, sweating mass by the\npressure of the eager bodies around us. I have never heard any sound\neven remotely like the babel of angry, sibilant whispering that beat\nagainst the walls and roof of that cavern.\n\nI had saved my own bombs for a specific purpose, and now I unslung\nthem and managed to work them up above my shoulders, one in either\nhand.\n\n\"I'm going to try to blow the entrance clear, men,\" I shouted. \"The\ninstant I fling the bombs, drop! The fragments will be stopped by the\nenemy crowding around us. One ... two ... three ... _drop_!\"\n\nThe two bombs exploded almost simultaneously. The ground shook, and\nall over the cavern masses of stone came crashing to the floor. Bits\nof rock hummed and shrieked over our heads. And--yes! There was a\ndraft of cooler, purer air on our faces. The bombs had done their\nwork.\n\n\"One more effort and we're outside, men,\" I called. \"The passage is\nopen, and there are only a few of the enemy before us. Ready?\"\n\n\"Ready!\" went up the hoarse shout.\n\n\"Then, forward!\"\n\nIt was easy to give the command, but hard to execute it. We were\npressed so hard that only the men on the outside of the group could\nuse their weapons. And our captors were making a terrible, desperate\neffort to hold us.\n\nTwo more of our men were literally torn to pieces before my eyes, but\nI had the satisfaction of ripping holes in the heads of the creatures\nwhose tentacles had done the beastly work. And in the meantime we were\nworking our way slowly but surely to the entrance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI glanced up as I dodged out into the open. That soft humming sound\nwas familiar, and properly so. There, at an elevation of less than\nfifty feet, was the _Ertak_, with Hendricks standing in the exit,\nleaning forward at a perilous angle.\n\n\"Ahoy the _Ertak_!\" I hailed. \"Descend at once!\"\n\n\"Right, sir!\" Hendricks turned to relay the order, and, as the rest of\nthe men burst forth from the cavern, the ship struck the ground before\nus.\n\n\"All hands board ship!\" I ordered. \"Lively, now.\" As many years as I\nhave commanded men, I have never seen an order obeyed with more\nalacrity.\n\nI was the last man to enter, and as I did so, I turned for a last\nglance at the enemy.\n\nThey could not come through the small opening my bombs had driven in\nthe rock, although they were working desperately to enlarge it.\nLeaping back and forth between me and the entrance I could see the\nvague, shadowy figures of the outside slaves, eagerly seeping up the\nlife-giving fumes that escaped from the cavern.\n\n\"Your orders, sir?\" asked Hendricks anxiously; he was a very young\nofficer, and he had been through a very trying experience.\n\n\"Ascend five hundred feet, Mr. Hendricks,\" I said thoughtfully.\n\"Directly over this spot. Then I'll take over.\n\n\"It isn't often,\" I added, \"that the Service concerns itself with\neconomic conditions. This, however, is one of the exceptions.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hendricks, for the very good reason, I suppose, that\nthat was about all a third officer could say to his commander, under\nthe circumstances.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Five hundred feet, sir,\" said Hendricks.\n\n\"Very well,\" I nodded, and pressed the attention signal of the\nnon-commissioned officer in charge of the big forward ray projector.\n\n\"Ott? Commander Hanson speaking. I have special orders for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\n\"Direct your ray, narrowed to normal beam and at full intensity, on\nthe spot directly below. Keep the ray motionless, and carry on until\nfurther orders. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir.\" The disintegrator ray generators deepened their purr\nas I turned away.\n\n\"I trust, sir, that I did the right thing in following you with the\n_Ertak_?\" asked Hendricks. \"I was absolutely without precedent, and\nthe circumstances were so mysterious--\"\n\n\"You handled the situation very well indeed,\" I told him. \"Had you not\nbeen waiting when we fought our way into the open, the nearly\ninvisible things on the outside might have--but you don't know about\nthem yet.\"\n\nPicking up the microphone again, I ordered a pair of searchlights to\nfollow the disintegrator ray, and made my way forward, where I could\nobserve activities through a port.\n\nThe ray was boring straight down into a shoulder of a rocky hill, and\nthe bright beams of the searchlights glowed redly with the dust of\ndisintegration. Here and there I could see the shadowy, transparent\nforms of the creatures that the self-constituted rulers of this world\nhad doomed to a demi-existence, and I smiled grimly to myself. The\ntables would soon be turned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor perhaps an hour the ray melted its way into the solid rock, while\nI stood beside Ott and his crew, watching. Then, down below us, things\nbegan to happen.\n\nLittle fragments of rock flew up from the shaft the ray had drilled.\nJets of black mud leaped into the air. There was a sudden blast from\nbelow that rocked the _Ertak_, and the shaft became a miniature\nvolcano, throwing rocky fragments and mud high into the air.\n\n\"Very good, Ott,\" I said triumphantly. \"Cease action.\" As I spoke, the\nfirst light of the dawn, unnoticed until now, spread itself over the\nscene, and we witnessed then one of the strangest scenes that the\nUniverse has ever beheld.\n\nUp to the very edge of that life-giving blast of mineral-laden gas the\ntenuous creatures came crowding. There were hundreds of them,\nthousands of them. And they were still coming, crowding closer and\ncloser and closer, a mass of crawling, yellowish shadows against the\nsombre earth.\n\nSlowly, they began to fill out and darken, as they drew in the fumes\nthat were more than bread and meat and water to us. Where there had\nbeen formless shadows, rotund creatures such as we had met in the\ncavern stood and lashed their tentacles about in a sort of frenzied\ngladness, and fell back to make room for their brothers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's a sight to make a man doubt his own eyes, sir,\" said Correy, who\nhad come to stand beside me. \"Look at them! Thousands of them pouring\nfrom every direction. How did it happen?\"\n\n\"It didn't happen. I used our disintegrator ray as a drill; we simply\nsunk a huge shaft down into the bowels of the earth until we struck\nthe source of the vapor which the self-appointed 'ruling class' has\nbottled up. We have emancipated a whole people, Mr. Correy.\"\n\n\"I hate to think of what will happen to those in the cavern,\" replied\nCorrey, smiling grimly. \"Or rather, since you've told me of the\npleasant little death they had arranged for us. I'm mighty glad of it.\nThey'll receive rough treatment, I'm afraid!\"\n\n\"They deserve it. It has been a great sight to watch, but I believe\nwe've seen enough. It has been a good night's work, but it's daylight,\nnow, and it will take hours to repair the damage to the _Ertak's_\nhull. Take over in the navigating room, if you will, and pick a likely\nspot where we will not be disturbed. We should be on our course by\nto-night, Mr. Correy.\"\n\n\"Right, sir,\" said Correy, with a last wondering look at the strange\nmiracle we had brought to pass on the earth below us. \"It will seem\ngood to be off in space again, away from the troubles of these little\nworlds.\"\n\n\"There are troubles in space, too,\" I said dryly, thinking of the\nswarm of meteorites that had come so close to wiping the _Ertak_ off\nthe records of the Service. \"You can't escape trouble even in space.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Correy from the doorway. \"But you can get your sleep\nregularly!\"\n\nAnd sleep is, when one comes to think of it, a very precious thing.\n\nParticularly for an old man, whose eyelids are heavy with years.\n\n\n\n\nReaders' Corner\n\n[Illustration: Readers' Corner]\n\n\n     _Now In Book Form_\n\n     Readers of Astounding Stories will be interested to hear\n     that two of the continued novels which appeared in our pages\n     during last year are coming out in book form.\n\n     The first of these is \"Murder Madness,\" by Murray Leinster.\n     It is due sometime in February, so by the time this issue is\n     on the newsstands it will no doubt be already out.

It has no\n     fictional connection with the others; it is in no sense a\n     sequel, but rather a companion story.\n\n     To write about Time-traveling is for me a difficult but\n     fascinating task. The opportunities are endless; and I hope\n     you may think I have taken advantage of them with a measure\n     of success.\n\n     I wrote those conceptions of Time and Space and the Great\n     Cosmos, which you will find in the text of the story,\n     because I feel them very deeply. Each occasion upon which\n     circumstances allow me to present my theories, I eagerly\n     welcome. How much of the conception is original with me, I\n     cannot say. It is the product of my groping interpretation\n     of the theories of many brilliant scientific minds of\n     today--humbly combined with perhaps some originality of my\n     own. The mind flings far afield when it starts to grope with\n     the Unknown. Try it! Read what I have written and then let\n     your mind roam a little further. Probe a little deeper.\n     Perhaps we may contribute something. It is only by that\n     process--each mind following some other's cleared path and\n     pushing forward a little on his own--that the Unknown can be\n     pierced.\n\n     When once you admit the basic idea of Time-traveling to be\n     plausible, what fascinating vistas are opened to the\n     imagination!\n\n     Space is so crowded! The room in which you are now sitting\n     as you read these words--just think what that Space around\n     you has held in the Past, and will hold in the Future! You\n     occupy it now, playing out your little part; but think what\n     has happened where you are now sitting so calmly reading!\n     What tumultuous, crowding events! Your room is quiet now,\n     but its space has rung with war-cries; the ground under you\n     has been drenched with blood; and further back it was lush\n     with primeval jungle; and in another age it was frozen\n     beneath a great ice-cap; and before that it blazed, molten\n     with fire. Back to the Beginning.\n\n     And your little Space in the Future? It will be in the heart\n     of a great mechanical city, perhaps. A mechanical servant\n     may murder his human master in the space which you now call\n     your room. The great revolt of the mechanisms may start in\n     your room....\n\n     I think that your room will some day again be shrouded under\n     a forest growth. The mechanical city will be neglected,\n     tumbled into ruins, buried beneath the silt of the passing\n     centuries. The sun will slowly rise--a giant dull red ball,\n     burning out, cooling. And the Earth will cool. Humans,\n     perhaps, will have passed decadence and reverted to\n     savagery. Perhaps the polar ice-caps will again come down,\n     and ice slowly cover the dying world. All nature will be\n     struggling and dying, with the sun a red ball turning dark\n     like a cooling ember.\n\n     Millions of centuries, with whatever events--who am I to\n     say?--but it will go on to the End. That's a long way from\n     the Beginning, isn't it? And yet ours is only a tiny planet\n     living briefly in the great cosmos of Time and Space!\n\n     A segment of Everything that ever was and ever will be\n     marches through the Space of your room. What an enormously\n     thronged little Space! There is only Time, to keep\n     consecutive and orderly the myriad events which in your room\n     are pushing and jostling one another! I say, then, \"Time is\n     what keeps everything from happening at once.\" It seems a\n     good definition.\n\n     I do hope you like \"The Exile of Time.\" The writing of it\n     made me realize how unimportant I am. A human lifetime is\n     really as brief as the flash of an electric spark. The whole\n     lifetime of our Earth is not much more than that. Stars,\n     worlds, are born, live and die, and the Great Cosmos goes\n     majestically on. Yet some people seem to feel that they and\n     the Space they occupy in this Time they call the Present are\n     the most important things that ever were or ever will be in\n     the whole Universe. It is a good thing to realize that that\n     isn't so.--Ray Cummings.\n\n\n_Likes_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Starting with the August issue, I am going to give my\n     opinion of the stories.\n\n     \"The Planet of Dread,\" by R. F. Starzl, couldn't have been\n     better. Get more stories by him. \"Murder Madness,\" by Murray\n     Leinster, was a good story, but it didn't belong in a\n     Science Fiction magazine. \"The Terrible Tentacles of L-472,\"\n     a good story; \"The Invisible Death,\" a very good story;\n     \"Prisoners on the Electron,\" very good; \"The Ape-Men of\n     Xlotli,\" a good story, but it does not belong in a Science\n     Fiction magazine; \"The Pirate Planet,\" very excellent--much\n     more so because it is an interplanetary story. \"Vagabonds of\n     Space,\" \"The Fifth Dimension Catapult,\" \"The Gate of Xoran,\"\n     \"The Dark Side of Antri\"--all good.\n\n     Well, I guess I will sign off and give somebody else a\n     chance to broadcast.--Wm. McCalvy, 1244 Beech St., St. Paul,\n     Minn.\n\n\n_I Do; I Don't_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     \"I like the magazine the way it is,\" \"I want a larger\n     magazine,\" \"I want a magazine twice a month,\" \"I want a\n     quarterly,\" and so do I, \"There is a terrible flaw in one of\n     the stories,\" \"All of the stories are flawless,\" \"I want\n     reprints,\" \"I don't,\" \"I like Ray Cummings,\" \"I don't,\" \"I\n     want a better grade paper,\" \"The paper's O. K. with me,\" \"I\n     want smooth edges on the magazine,\" \"So do I,\" \"And so do\n     I!\"--these seem to be the most often repeated sentences in\n     the letters from Readers.\n\n     However, I have a new one to add: I would like to see an\n     answer, by the Editor, to each letter that is printed in\n     \"The Readers' Corner,\" like this: \"I liked 'An Extra Man,'\n     etc.--Mr. Syence Ficshun\" (I am very glad to hear that you\n     liked this little masterpiece, etc.--Editor). Why not?\n\n     The illustration on the cover of the January issue surely\n     shows that you're starting the new year out right by putting\n     on an extremely astounding cover. The story \"The Gate to\n     Xoran\" is simply amazing. Let's read many more of Mr. Wells\n     stories. It is far surpassed, however, by \"The Fifth\n     Dimension Catapult,\" which is the best story (novelette)\n     that I have ever read in \"our\" magazine.\n\n     The Boys' Scientification Club is now a branch of the famous\n     Science Correspondence Club. Remember, boys between the ages\n     of 10 and 15, if you're interested in reading Science\n     Fiction, by all means join the B. S. C. We have many copies\n     of Astounding Stories in our library and members are welcome\n     to read them. For further details write to me.--Forrest J.\n     Ackerman, President-Librarian, B. S. C., 530 Staples Avenue,\n     San Francisco, Cal.\n\n\n_Souls and Integrations_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     You are starting your second year as Editor of Astounding\n     Stories. If your standard during 1931 is up to your standard\n     of 1930, we shall be satisfied. If possible, give us, the\n     Readers, the best in Science Fiction. I have no doubt but\n     that the Readers of Astounding Stories would not want\n     fantasy unless written by a master; and to my mind there is\n     only one whom I will forgive for not making his stories\n     Science Fiction, and that writer is A. Merritt. Every other\n     writer should and must put plausible science in his stories.\n     If he doesn't, he won't go far; not with Science Fiction\n     readers, anyway.\n\n     I do not agree to your answer, by letter, to my complaint\n     about the science in the story, \"An Extra Man,\" by Jackson\n     Gee. You say that two men, each the size and half the weight\n     of the original man could have been formed from the\n     integrated particles of the original man. In the story, the\n     weight of the two men was exactly the same as that of the\n     original man. [?] Anyway, I do not believe that these two\n     men could have been formed. Most likely, when the\n     laboratories began the process of reintegration, the person\n     integrated would have been cut in half, provided of course,\n     that the laboratories began the process at the same time. If\n     not, one laboratory would produce a larger portion of an\n     integrated man than the other.\n\n     But to come back to the original question. Can a man be\n     disintegrated into his component atoms and then reintegrated\n     into two men each half the size, weight, ability and brains?\n     I say no. I believe that the component atoms of the man when\n     reintegrated would be in exactly the same place as they were\n     before the disintegration occurred. If a part and not the\n     whole of a man is reintegrated in one place, then the part\n     would be one part of that man and not a complete man in\n     itself.\n\n     It would be as preposterous and absurd for anything but a\n     part of that man to be reintegrated, as it would be for two\n     apes, pigs or hens to come from him. I leave out the\n     question of what would happen to the soul. Imagine a soul\n     divided in half. Mr. Gee might say that he doesn't believe\n     in souls. Neither do I, much. I notice that some Readers say\n     that they liked that story. One even says that it was\n     perfect. Every man to his taste. I've read worse, myself.\n\n     Anyway, Mr. Editor, Astounding Stories is the finest and\n     best Science Fiction magazine on the market.\n\n     Many Readers want to keep their magazines and bind them,\n     including myself. Why change the size? I'm certain that that\n     won't be done. Astounding Stories started small (in size\n     only) and it will remain small (also only in size). Let us\n     have reprints.--Nathan Greenfeld, 373 Whitlock Ave., New\n     York City.\n\n\n_The Defense Rests_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just read the January issue for 1931 and noticed some\n     so-called helpful letters by Readers. Looking over Mr.\n     Waite's letter, would like to suggest that he stop to think,\n     if possible, that if he wants absolute bone-dry facts, that\n     he doesn't want fiction at all. And Mr. Johnson--he seems\n     to have the impression that everyone who can take things for\n     granted without having a detailed explanation of the facts\n     of the story is a moron or a small child. He should go find\n     a volume of scientific research if he enjoys that sort of\n     stuff. I read fiction stories for the enjoyment I get out of\n     them and not to criticize them for lack of explanation. I\n     would rather read some of his so-called nonsense than a lot\n     of far-flung, intricate, baseless scientific explanations.\n     Why doesn't Mr. Johnson use his imagination?--Donald Kahl,\n     360 Selby Ave., St. Paul, Minn.\n\n\n_\"High Time\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been reading the magazine ever since it first came\n     out, a year ago, so it is high time for me to write. It\n     certainly grows better with every new issue.\n\n     I think that the ten best stories published during 1930 were\n     (not in order of merit): \"Brigands of the Moon,\" \"Vandals of\n     the Stars,\" \"The Atom Smasher,\" \"The Moon Master,\" \"Earth,\n     the Marauder,\" \"The Planet of Dread,\" \"Silver Dome,\" \"The\n     Second Satellite,\" \"Jetta of the Lowlands\" and \"The Pirate\n     Planet.\"\n\n     Your ten best authors are: Harl Vincent, Ray Cummings,\n     Charles W. Diffin, Victor Rousseau, Capt. S. P. Meek, Murray\n     Leinster, Arthur J. Burks, R. F. Starzl, Sewell P. Wright\n     and Edmond Hamilton.\n\n     The Commander Hanson stories by S. P. Wright are great.\n     Let's have lots more of them.\n\n     And now about reprints. I cast my vote like many other\n     readers in favor of them. Many Readers, in fact over half,\n     are new Readers of Science Fiction. They, like myself, have\n     not read the great masterpieces such as \"The Time Machine,\"\n     \"The Moon Pool\" and countless other stories. Now, why not\n     reprint some of them and give us a chance to read them? A\n     few Readers who have read them before do not want them\n     reprinted because they do not want anybody else to read\n     them.\n\n     A brickbat: Why not cut the edges of the magazine smooth? It\n     would be much easier to handle.\n\n     A bouquet: You have a fine magazine. Keep up the good stuff.\n     My criticism is exhausted, so good-by until next\n     time.--Oswald Train, P. O. Box 94, Barnesboro, Pa.\n\n\n_Two Dimensions Off?_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     It was just by accident that I came across your magazine,\n     and I have read every issue since.\n\n     In the January number there is one story that I don't like,\n     \"The Fifth Dimension Catapult.\" As far as the story is\n     concerned it is very good, but Professor Denham was not\n     marooned in the fifth dimension. If you read the story you\n     will find that Professor Denham was marooned on a three\n     dimensional world. That is all I can make out.\n\n     Astounding Stories is the best Science Fiction magazine I\n     have ever read, and I shall keep on reading it.\n\n     Keep up the good cover illustrations.--Richard Meindle, R.\n     1, Box 91, Butternut, Wisconsin.\n\n\n_To the Colors!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Being a passionate admirer of Dr. Breuer and his writings, I\n     cannot permit the contumelious, unfounded aggression of one\n     George K. Addison to go on unconfuted.\n\n     Perceiving that Dr. Breuer cannot possibly vindicate himself\n     against this disparagement I feel obliged to extenuate Dr.\n     Breuer in the eyes of the Readers.\n\n     In the first place, Dr. Breuer writes rarely and sparingly\n     and does not grind out his stories month after month as do\n     some other authors. His stories are highly original and are\n     presented in a purely literary style. The story to which Mr.\n     Addison refers, \"A Problem in Communication,\" is a fine\n     example of his work. Should his story be remonstrated\n     against because it is lacking in adventure, because it did\n     not delineate mushy love episodes, because it does not cause\n     chills to run down one's spine? Positively not! It lives up\n     to the standard of the highest Science Fiction. Here is a\n     story unbesmirched by the love element, exceedingly\n     plausible and interestingly narrated.\n\n     If all stories were thought out and written just half as\n     carefully as Dr. Breuer's, Astounding Stories would become a\n     periodical justified to be considered on a par with The\n     Golden Book.\n\n     In closing, I wish to express my desire that more stories of\n     the Breuer quality be bestowed upon the Readers.--Mortimer\n     Weisinger, 266 Van Cortland Ave., Bronx, New York.\n\n\n_And It Wasn't!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Having read \"The Readers' Corner\" since its first appearance\n     in Astounding Stories and noted the various criticisms\n     offered, may I tell you about a story written by a Science\n     Fiction author?\n\n     The author, by the way, is the perfect author; he makes\n     absolutely no mistakes in his story, and is in no danger of\n     starving if his works aren't accepted and older stories are\n     reprinted instead. His science is correct and the story\n     contains nothing that cannot be understood.\n\n     The story is of interplanetary adventure. Strange to say,\n     there is no war in the story; there is no villain; there is\n     no hero to save a world from destruction or his sweetheart\n     from the monsters of another planet. Instead, there are\n     nothing but characters--if you get what I mean. The persons\n     involved in this interplanetary novel reach their goal due\n     to the tremendous strides of science in experimenting with\n     air and space vehicles.\n\n     When they arrive on the planet they do not meet hostile\n     nations. They do not meet monstrosities. They do, however,\n     meet people much like themselves who do not welcome the\n     travelers with open arms and show them about their city, but\n     regard them with curiosity and treat them with all due\n     respect for their achievement in conquering space.\n\n     As I said before, there is no hero who falls in love with\n     the beautiful girl from the planet visited, and saves her\n     and her country from other warring nations. To tell the\n     truth, the adventurers have their own loved ones at home.\n     They meet no intrigue. When they have learned all they\n     can--experiencing many difficulties in mastering the\n     language used, for the people of the planet have not\n     perfected a brain-copier or other like mechanism--they\n     arrange for commerce and travel between the two worlds and\n     return to Earth. On their return, they are not met with\n     world wide ovations and made heroes of, but receive credit\n     for their undertaking and are soon forgotten about.\n\n     To cap the climax, the story is acceptable to the Editors.\n     It is not in need of corrections and is published\n     immediately. The story is gratefully accepted by the public\n     and not one single soul writes a scathing letter to the\n     Editor telling why it was not good. In fact, I can hardly\n     believe that such a story was written. Possibly it\n     wasn't!--Robert R. Young, 86 Third Avenue, Kingston, Penn.\n\n\n_Ha-ha!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Christmas day, and because I'm not acquainted in this city\n     I'm writing you a letter.\n\n     I have just finished reading your magazine. I came close to\n     not buying it, being not overly prosperous, but decided to\n     take a chance when I saw you had a dimensional story by\n     Murray Leinster. That story was up to expectations. The\n     others were down to expectations.\n\n     If you want me to choose your magazine to spend my reading\n     allowance on, have more stories by Leinster, Starzl, Breuer\n     and Wells. It may take a little more effort, but it's worth\n     it. Sax Rohmer is good on science stuff, too.\n\n     Before you print any more undersea stories have a diver look\n     at them. You tell about standing at the bottom of the ocean\n     and seeing the submarine \"not more than a quarter of a mile\n     away.\" Ha-ha! [No fair, that ha-ha! For the story says,\n     quoted exactly: \"... there gleamed the reassuring LIGHTS of\n     the Nereid, not a quarter of a mile away.\" Probably, intense\n     searchlight beams could be seen that far.--Ed.] You couldn't\n     see it if you stood more than ten feet away. I'm not trying\n     to be critical, but you should be more careful.--Myron\n     Higgins, 524 West 100th St., New York City.\n\n\n_We Never Will_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been an enthusiastic reader of Astounding Stories\n     since it was founded, and I think it about time that I\n     voiced my opinion of your great magazine.\n\n     Taking all in all it's a vow, but of course it could be\n     made better by having a quarterly, which I am sure would go\n     over big.\n\n     Wesso is great, so why not have all the illustrations by\n     him?\n\n     Your authors are also great. Nearly every story I have read\n     was perfect, and whatever you do don't lose R. F. Starzl.\n     His ideas are very good, as illustrated in \"The Planet of\n     Dread.\"\n\n     There is only one more thing I would like to ask of you, and\n     that is the reason why I write. Please don't spoil the\n     magazine by endeavoring to please a very small minority by\n     putting in unnecessary scientific explanations. The reason\n     why I like your magazine so much is because of the fact that\n     it is unique in that respect. I have read a few stories in\n     other scientific magazines and found that they contained too\n     much explanation. I hope for the benefit of other Readers\n     and myself that you will not change the stories by adding\n     too much explanation.\n\n     In the coming year I wish you all possible success.--John\n     Sheehan, 32 Elm St., Cambridge, Mass.\n\n\n_This and That_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     In the October issue of Astounding Stories Mr. Woodrow\n     Gelman cast vote number 1 for reprints. In the February,\n     1931, issue, Mr. Forgaris throws in number 2 and here goes\n     number 3. I really don't see why, even after the arguments\n     you printed, you don't print at least one a year. I have\n     been reading your magazine ever since it came out and have\n     found that at least one-half of your Readers want reprints.\n     Can't you print at least one for an experiment?\n\n     Ray Cummings, S. P. Meek, Dr. Miles J. Breuer, Sewell P.\n     Wright and Harl Vincent are your best authors. Wesso is your\n     best artist by far.\n\n     There were several stories I did not like. They are:\n     \"Monsters of Moyen,\" \"Earth, the Marauder,\" and I guess\n     those are all.\n\n     How about giving us some short short stories? And how about\n     cutting the edges of the paper smooth? And giving us a\n     quarterly? But all in all I think your magazine is one of\n     the best in the field.--Vernon H. Jones, 1603 Sixth Ave.,\n     Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n\n_It's Your Imagination_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Well, well! Astounding Stories was two days early this\n     month. See that this happens more often.\n\n     Of course, \"The Pirate Planet\" took first place in the\n     February number. The story was very well written and the\n     characters very realistic. It deserves to be put in book\n     form, also in the talkies. It would be much better than\n     \"Just Imagine.\"\n\n     I welcome Anthony Gilmore, D. W. Hall and F. V. W. Mason to\n     Astounding Stories. Their stories proved to be very\n     interesting and I hope to read more.\n\n     Do you know how to write editorials? Yes? Then prove it. I\n     have to be shown. Write on some scientific subject each\n     month, and every so often write on Astounding Stories itself\n     and of its stories and authors.\n\n     Is it my imagination or have you been using a better grade\n     of paper in the past two issues? it seems to be much\n     smoother and a little thinner than that used previously.\n\n     I notice that you are giving more room to some of the\n     illustrations, as in \"Werewolves of War\" and \"The Pirate\n     Planet.\" The larger the illustrations are the more there can\n     be put in them.--Jack Darrow, 4225 No. Spaulding Ave.,\n     Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n_If He But Could!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Astounding Stories is without doubt the most preeminent in\n     its field.\n\n     With such versatile authors as Burks (When does his next\n     story appear?), Starzl, Cummings, Leinster, Vincent and all\n     the rest, how can it help but to overshadow all periodicals!\n\n     The illustrations are superfine. Wesso is a marvel! If he\n     could only write his own stories and illustrate them!\n\n     Now, a suggestion.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
