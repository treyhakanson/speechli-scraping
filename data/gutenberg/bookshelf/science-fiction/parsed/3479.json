Merritt\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nBefore the narrative which follows was placed in my hands, I had never\nseen Dr. Walter T. Goodwin, its author.\n\nWhen the manuscript revealing his adventures among the pre-historic\nruins of the Nan-Matal in the Carolines (The Moon Pool) had been given\nme by the International Association of Science for editing and revision\nto meet the requirements of a popular presentation, Dr. Goodwin had left\nAmerica. He had explained that he was still too shaken, too depressed,\nto be able to recall experiences that must inevitably carry with them\nfreshened memories of those whom he loved so well and from whom, he\nfelt, he was separated in all probability forever.\n\nI had understood that he had gone to some remote part of Asia to pursue\ncertain botanical studies, and it was therefore with the liveliest\nsurprise and interest that I received a summons from the President of\nthe Association to meet Dr. Goodwin at a designated place and hour.\n\nThrough my close study of the Moon Pool papers I had formed a mental\nimage of their writer. I had read, too, those volumes of botanical\nresearch which have set him high above all other American scientists in\nthis field, gleaning from their curious mingling of extremely\ntechnical observations and minutely accurate but extraordinarily poetic\ndescriptions, hints to amplify my picture of him. It gratified me to\nfind I had drawn a pretty good one.\n\nThe man to whom the President of the Association introduced me was\nsturdy, well-knit, a little under average height. He had a broad but\nrather low forehead that reminded me somewhat of the late electrical\nwizard Steinmetz. Under level black brows shone eyes of clear hazel,\nkindly, shrewd, a little wistful, lightly humorous; the eyes both of a\ndoer and a dreamer.\n\nNot more than forty I judged him to be. A close-trimmed, pointed beard\ndid not hide the firm chin and the clean-cut mouth. His hair was thick\nand black and oddly sprinkled with white; small streaks and dots of\ngleaming silver that shone with a curiously metallic luster.\n\nHis right arm was closely bound to his breast. His manner as he greeted\nme was tinged with shyness. He extended his left hand in greeting, and\nas I clasped the fingers I was struck by their peculiar, pronounced, yet\npleasant warmth; a sensation, indeed, curiously electric.\n\nThe Association's President forced him gently back into his chair.\n\n\"Dr. Goodwin,\" he said, turning to me, \"is not entirely recovered as\nyet from certain consequences of his adventures. He will explain to you\nlater what these are. In the meantime, Mr. Merritt, will you read this?\"\n\nI took the sheets he handed me, and as I read them felt the gaze of Dr.\nGoodwin full upon me, searching, weighing, estimating. When I raised my\neyes from the letter I found in his a new expression. The shyness was\ngone; they were filled with complete friendliness. Evidently I had\npassed muster.\n\n\"You will accept, sir?\" It was the president's gravely courteous tone.\n\n\"Accept!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, of course, I accept. It is not only one of\nthe greatest honors, but to me one of the greatest delights to act as a\ncollaborator with Dr. Goodwin.\"\n\nThe president smiled.\n\n\"In that case, sir, there is no need for me to remain longer,\" he said.\n\"Dr. Goodwin has with him his manuscript as far as he has progressed\nwith it. I will leave you two alone for your discussion.\"\n\nHe bowed to us and, picking up his old-fashioned bell-crowned silk hat\nand his quaint, heavy cane of ebony, withdrew. Dr. Goodwin turned to me.\n\n\"I will start,\" he said, after a little pause, \"from when I met Richard\nDrake on the field of blue poppies that are like a great prayer-rug at\nthe gray feet of the nameless mountain.\"\n\nThe sun sank, the shadows fell, the lights of the city sparkled out, for\nhours New York roared about me unheeded while I listened to the tale\nof that utterly weird, stupendous drama of an unknown life, of unknown\ncreatures, unknown forces, and of unconquerable human heroism played\namong the hidden gorges of unknown Asia.\n\nIt was dawn when I left him for my own home. Nor was it for many\nhours after that I laid his then incomplete manuscript down and sought\nsleep--and found a troubled sleep.\n\nA. MERRITT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. VALLEY OF THE BLUE POPPIES\n\nIn this great crucible of life we call the world--in the vaster one we\ncall the universe--the mysteries lie close packed, uncountable as grains\nof sand on ocean's shores. They thread gigantic, the star-flung spaces;\nthey creep, atomic, beneath the microscope's peering eye. They walk\nbeside us, unseen and unheard, calling out to us, asking why we are deaf\nto their crying, blind to their wonder.\n\nSometimes the veils drop from a man's eyes, and he sees--and speaks of\nhis vision. Then those who have not seen pass him by with the lifted\nbrows of disbelief, or they mock him, or if his vision has been great\nenough they fall upon and destroy him.\n\nFor the greater the mystery, the more bitterly is its verity assailed;\nupon what seem the lesser a man may give testimony and at least gain for\nhimself a hearing.\n\nThere is reason for this. Life is a ferment, and upon and about it,\nshifting and changing, adding to or taking away, beat over legions of\nforces, seen and unseen, known and unknown. And man, an atom in the\nferment, clings desperately to what to him seems stable; nor greets with\njoy him who hazards that what he grips may be but a broken staff, and,\nso saying, fails to hold forth a sturdier one.\n\nEarth is a ship, plowing her way through uncharted oceans of space\nwherein are strange currents, hidden shoals and reefs, and where blow\nthe unknown winds of Cosmos.\n\nIf to the voyagers, painfully plotting their course, comes one who cries\nthat their charts must be remade, nor can tell WHY they must be--that\nman is not welcome--no!\n\nTherefore it is that men have grown chary of giving testimony upon\nmysteries. Yet knowing each in his own heart the truth of that vision he\nhas himself beheld, lo, it is that in whose reality he most believes.\n\nThe spot where I had encamped was of a singular beauty; so beautiful\nthat it caught the throat and set an ache within the breast--until from\nit a tranquillity distilled that was like healing mist.\n\nSince early March I had been wandering. It was now mid-July. And for the\nfirst time since my pilgrimage had begun I drank--not of forgetfulness,\nfor that could never be--but of anodyne for a sorrow which had held fast\nupon me since my return from the Carolines a year before.\n\nNo need to dwell here upon that--it has been written. Nor shall I recite\nthe reasons for my restlessness--for these are known to those who have\nread that history of mine. Nor is there cause to set forth at length the\nsteps by which I had arrived at this vale of peace.\n\nSufficient is to tell that in New York one night, reading over what is\nperhaps the most sensational of my books--\"The Poppies and Primulas of\nSouthern Tibet,\" the result of my travels of 1910-1911, I determined to\nreturn to that quiet, forbidden land. There, if anywhere, might I find\nsomething akin to forgetting.\n\nThere was a certain flower which I long had wished to study in its\nmutations from the singular forms appearing on the southern slopes of\nthe Elburz--Persia's mountainous chain that extends from Azerbaijan\nin the west to Khorasan in the east; from thence I would follow its\nmodified types in the Hindu-Kush ranges and its migrations along the\nsouthern scarps of the Trans-Himalayas--the unexplored upheaval, higher\nthan the Himalayas themselves, more deeply cut with precipice and gorge,\nwhich Sven Hedin had touched and named on his journey to Lhasa.\n\nHaving accomplished this, I planned to push across the passes to the\nManasarowar Lakes, where, legend has it, the strange, luminous purple\nlotuses grow.\n\nAn ambitious project, undeniably fraught with danger; but it is\nwritten that desperate diseases require desperate remedies, and until\ninspiration or message how to rejoin those whom I had loved so dearly\ncame to me, nothing less, I felt, could dull my heartache.\n\nAnd, frankly, feeling that no such inspiration or message could come, I\ndid not much care as to the end.\n\nIn Teheran I had picked up a most unusual servant; yes, more than this,\na companion and counselor and interpreter as well.\n\nHe was a Chinese; his name Chiu-Ming. His first thirty years had been\nspent at the great Lamasery of Palkhor-Choinde at Gyantse, west of\nLhasa. Why he had gone from there, how he had come to Teheran, I never\nasked. It was most fortunate that he had gone, and that I had found him.\nHe recommended himself to me as the best cook within ten thousand miles\nof Pekin.\n\nFor almost three months we had journeyed; Chiu-Ming and I and the two\nponies that carried my impedimenta.\n\nWe had traversed mountain roads which had echoed to the marching feet of\nthe hosts of Darius, to the hordes of the Satraps. The highways of the\nAchaemenids--yes, and which before them had trembled to the tramplings\nof the myriads of the godlike Dravidian conquerors.\n\nWe had slipped over ancient Iranian trails; over paths which the\nwarriors of conquering Alexander had traversed; dust of bones of\nMacedons, of Greeks, of Romans, beat about us; ashes of the flaming\nambitions of the Sassanidae whimpered beneath our feet--the feet of an\nAmerican botanist, a Chinaman, two Tibetan ponies. We had crept through\nclefts whose walls had sent back the howlings of the Ephthalites, the\nWhite Huns who had sapped the strength of these same proud Sassanids\nuntil at last both fell before the Turks.\n\nOver the highways and byways of Persia's glory, Persia's shame and\nPersia's death we four--two men, two beasts--had passed. For a fortnight\nwe had met no human soul, seen no sign of human habitation.\n\nGame had been plentiful--green things Chiu-Ming might lack for his\ncooking, but meat never. About us was a welter of mighty summits. We\nwere, I knew, somewhere within the blending of the Hindu-Kush with the\nTrans-Himalayas.\n\nThat morning we had come out of a ragged defile into this valley of\nenchantment, and here, though it had been so early, I had pitched my\ntent, determining to go no farther till the morrow.\n\nIt was a Phocean vale; a gigantic cup filled with tranquillity. A spirit\nbrooded over it, serene, majestic, immutable--like the untroubled calm\nwhich rests, the Burmese believe, over every place which has guarded the\nBuddha, sleeping.\n\nAt its eastern end towered the colossal scarp of the unnamed peak\nthrough one of whose gorges we had crept. On his head was a cap of\nsilver set with pale emeralds--the snow fields and glaciers that crowned\nhim. Far to the west another gray and ochreous giant reared its bulk,\nclosing the vale. North and south, the horizon was a chaotic sky land of\npinnacles, spired and minareted, steepled and turreted and domed, each\ndiademed with its green and argent of eternal ice and snow.\n\nAnd all the valley was carpeted with the blue poppies in wide, unbroken\nfields, luminous as the morning skies of mid-June; they rippled mile\nafter mile over the path we had followed, over the still untrodden path\nwhich we must take. They nodded, they leaned toward each other, they\nseemed to whisper--then to lift their heads and look up like crowding\nswarms of little azure fays, half impudently, wholly trustfully, into\nthe faces of the jeweled giants standing guard over them. And when the\nlittle breeze walked upon them it was as though they bent beneath the\nsoft tread and were brushed by the sweeping skirts of unseen, hastening\nPresences.\n\nLike a vast prayer-rug, sapphire and silken, the poppies stretched\nto the gray feet of the mountain. Between their southern edge and\nthe clustering summits a row of faded brown, low hills knelt--like\nbrown-robed, withered and weary old men, backs bent, faces hidden\nbetween outstretched arms, palms to the earth and brows touching earth\nwithin them--in the East's immemorial attitude of worship.\n\nI half expected them to rise--and as I watched a man appeared on one of\nthe bowed, rocky shoulders, abruptly, with the ever-startling suddenness\nwhich in the strange light of these latitudes objects spring into\nvision. As he stood scanning my camp there arose beside him a laden\npony, and at its head a Tibetan peasant. The first figure waved its\nhand; came striding down the hill.\n\nAs he approached I took stock of him. A young giant, three good inches\nover six feet, a vigorous head with unruly clustering black hair; a\nclean-cut, clean-shaven American face.\n\n\"I'm Dick Drake,\" he said, holding out his hand. \"Richard Keen Drake,\nrecently with Uncle's engineers in France.\"\n\n\"My name is Goodwin.\" I took his hand, shook it warmly. \"Dr. Walter T.\nGoodwin.\"\n\n\"Goodwin the botanist--? Then I know you!\" he exclaimed. \"Know all\nabout you, that is. My father admired your work greatly. You knew\nhim--Professor Alvin Drake.\"\n\nI nodded. So he was Alvin Drake's son. Alvin, I knew, had died about a\nyear before I had started on this journey. But what was his son doing in\nthis wilderness?\n\n\"Wondering where I came from?\" he answered my unspoken question. \"Short\nstory. War ended. Felt an irresistible desire for something different.\nCouldn't think of anything more different from Tibet--always wanted to\ngo there anyway. Went. Decided to strike over toward Turkestan. And here\nI am.\"\n\nI felt at once a strong liking for this young giant. No doubt,\nsubconsciously, I had been feeling the need of companionship with my own\nkind. I even wondered, as I led the way into my little camp, whether he\nwould care to join fortunes with me in my journeyings.\n\nHis father's work I knew well, and although this stalwart lad was unlike\nwhat one would have expected Alvin Drake--a trifle dried, precise,\nwholly abstracted with his experiments--to beget, still, I reflected,\nheredity like the Lord sometimes works in mysterious ways its wonders to\nperform.\n\nIt was almost with awe that he listened to me instruct Chiu-Ming as to\njust how I wanted supper prepared, and his gaze dwelt fondly upon the\nChinese busy among his pots and pans.\n\nWe talked a little, desultorily, as the meal was prepared--fragments of\ntraveler's news and gossip, as is the habit of journeyers who come upon\neach other in the silent places. Ever the speculation grew in his face\nas he made away with Chiu-Ming's artful concoctions.\n\nDrake sighed, drawing out his pipe.\n\n\"A cook, a marvel of a cook. Where did you get him?\"\n\nBriefly I told him.\n\nThen a silence fell upon us. Suddenly the sun dipped down behind the\nflank of the stone giant guarding the valley's western gate; the whole\nvale swiftly darkened--a flood of crystal-clear shadows poured within\nit. It was the prelude to that miracle of unearthly beauty seen nowhere\nelse on this earth--the sunset of Tibet.\n\nWe turned expectant eyes to the west. A little, cool breeze raced down\nfrom the watching steeps like a messenger, whispered to the nodding\npoppies, sighed and was gone. The poppies were still. High overhead a\nhoming kite whistled, mellowly.\n\nAs if it were a signal there sprang out in the pale azure of the western\nsky row upon row of cirrus cloudlets, rank upon rank of them, thrusting\ntheir heads into the path of the setting sun. They changed from mottled\nsilver into faint rose, deepened to crimson.\n\n\"The dragons of the sky drink the blood of the sunset,\" said Chiu-Ming.\n\nAs though a gigantic globe of crystal had dropped upon the heavens,\ntheir blue turned swiftly to a clear and glowing amber--then as abruptly\nshifted to a luminous violet A soft green light pulsed through the\nvalley.\n\nUnder it, like hills ensorcelled, the rocky walls about it seemed to\nflatten. They glowed and all at once pressed forward like gigantic\nslices of palest emerald jade, translucent, illumined, as though by a\ncirclet of little suns shining behind them.\n\nThe light faded, robes of deepest amethyst dropped around the mountain's\nmighty shoulders. And then from every snow and glacier-crowned peak,\nfrom minaret and pinnacle and towering turret, leaped forth a confusion\nof soft peacock flames, a host of irised prismatic gleamings, an ordered\nchaos of rainbows.\n\nGreat and small, interlacing and shifting, they ringed the valley with\nan incredible glory--as if some god of light itself had touched the\neternal rocks and bidden radiant souls stand forth.\n\nThrough the darkening sky swept a rosy pencil of living light; that\nutterly strange, pure beam whose coming never fails to clutch the throat\nof the beholder with the hand of ecstasy, the ray which the Tibetans\nname the Ting-Pa. For a moment this rosy finger pointed to the east,\nthen arched itself, divided slowly into six shining, rosy bands; began\nto creep downward toward the eastern horizon where a nebulous, pulsing\nsplendor arose to meet it.\n\nAnd as we watched I heard a gasp from Drake. And it was echoed by my\nown.\n\nFor the six beams were swaying, moving with ever swifter motion from\nside to side in ever-widening sweep, as though the hidden orb from which\nthey sprang were swaying like a pendulum.\n\nFaster and faster the six high-flung beams swayed--and then broke--broke\nas though a gigantic, unseen hand had reached up and snapped them!\n\nAn instant the severed ends ribboned aimlessly, then bent, turned down\nand darted earthward into the welter of clustered summits at the north\nand swiftly were gone, while down upon the valley fell night.\n\n\"Good God!\" whispered Drake. \"It was as though something reached up,\nbroke those rays and drew them down--like threads.\"\n\n\"I saw it.\" I struggled with bewilderment. \"I saw it. But I never saw\nanything like it before,\" I ended, most inadequately.\n\n\"It was PURPOSEFUL,\" he whispered. \"It was DELIBERATE. As though\nsomething reached up, juggled with the rays, broke them, and drew them\ndown like willow withes.\"\n\n\"The devils that dwell here!\" quavered Chiu-Ming.\n\n\"Some magnetic phenomenon.\" I was half angry at myself for my own touch\nof panic. \"Light can be deflected by passage through a magnetic field.\nOf course that's it. Certainly.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Drake's tone was doubtful indeed. \"It would take a whale\nof a magnetic field to have done THAT--it's inconceivable.\" He harked\nback to his first idea. \"It was so--so DAMNED deliberate,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Devils--\" muttered the frightened Chinese.\n\n\"What's that?\" Drake gripped my arm and pointed to the north. A deeper\nblackness had grown there while we had been talking, a pool of darkness\nagainst which the mountain summits stood out, blade-sharp edges faintly\nluminous.\n\nA gigantic lance of misty green fire darted from the blackness and\nthrust its point into the heart of the zenith; following it, leaped into\nthe sky a host of the sparkling spears of light, and now the blackness\nwas like an ebon hand, brandishing a thousand javelins of tinseled\nflame.\n\n\"The aurora,\" I said.\n\n\"It ought to be a good one,\" mused Drake, gaze intent upon it. \"Did you\nnotice the big sun spot?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"The biggest I ever saw. Noticed it first at dawn this morning. Some\nlittle aurora lighter--that spot. I told you--look at that!\" he cried.\n\nThe green lances had fallen back. The blackness gathered itself\ntogether--then from it began to pulse billows of radiance, spangled with\ninfinite darting swarms of flashing corpuscles like uncounted hosts of\ndancing fireflies.\n\nHigher the waves rolled--phosphorescent green and iridescent violet,\nweird copperous yellows and metallic saffrons and a shimmer of\nglittering ash of rose--then wavered, split and formed into gigantic,\nsparkling, marching curtains of splendor.\n\nA vast circle of light sprang out upon the folds of the flickering,\nrushing curtains. Misty at first, its edges sharpened until they rested\nupon the blazing glory of the northern sky like a pale ring of cold\nflame. And about it the aurora began to churn, to heap itself, to\nrevolve.\n\nToward the ring from every side raced the majestic folds, drew\nthemselves together, circled, seethed around it like foam of fire about\nthe lip of a cauldron, and poured through the shining circle as though\nit were the mouth of that fabled cavern where old Aeolus sits blowing\nforth and breathing back the winds that sweep the earth.\n\nYes--into the ring's mouth the aurora flew, cascading in a columned\nstream to earth. Then swiftly, a mist swept over all the heavens, veiled\nthat incredible cataract.\n\n\"Magnetism?\" muttered Drake. \"I guess NOT!\"\n\n\"It struck about where the Ting-Pa was broken and seemed drawn down like\nthe rays,\" I said.\n\n\"Purposeful,\" Drake said. \"And devilish. It hit on all my nerves like\na--like a metal claw. Purposeful and deliberate. There was intelligence\nbehind that.\"\n\n\"Intelligence? Drake--what intelligence could break the rays of the\nsetting sun and suck down the aurora?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered.\n\n\"Devils,\" croaked Chiu-Ming. \"The devils that defied Buddha--and have\ngrown strong--\"\n\n\"Like a metal claw!\" breathed Drake.\n\nFar to the west a sound came to us; first a whisper, then a wild\nrushing, a prolonged wailing, a crackling. A great light flashed\nthrough the mist, glowed about us and faded. Again the wailing, the vast\nrushing, the retreating whisper.\n\nThen silence and darkness dropped embraced upon the valley of the blue\npoppies.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE SIGIL ON THE ROCKS\n\nDawn came. Drake had slept well. But I, who had not his youthful\nresiliency, lay for long, awake and uneasy. I had hardly sunk into\ntroubled slumber before dawn awakened me.\n\nAs we breakfasted, I approached directly that matter which my growing\nliking for him was turning into strong desire.\n\n\"Drake,\" I asked. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"With you,\" he laughed. \"I'm foot loose and fancy free. And I think you\nought to have somebody with you to help watch that cook. He might get\naway.\"\n\nThe idea seemed to appall him.\n\n\"Fine!\" I exclaimed heartily, and thrust out my hand to him. \"I'm\nthinking of striking over the range soon to the Manasarowar Lakes.\nThere's a curious flora I'd like to study.\"\n\n\"Anywhere you say suits me,\" he answered.\n\nWe clasped hands on our partnership and soon we were on our way to the\nvalley's western gate; our united caravans stringing along behind us.\nMile after mile we trudged through the blue poppies, discussing the\nenigmas of the twilight and of the night.\n\nIn the light of day their breath of vague terror was dissipated.\nThere was no place for mystery nor dread under this floor of brilliant\nsunshine. The smiling sapphire floor rolled ever on before us.\n\nWhispering little playful breezes flew down the slopes to gossip for a\nmoment with the nodding flowers. Flocks of rose finches raced chattering\noverhead to quarrel with the tiny willow warblers, the chi-u-teb-tok,\nholding fief of the drooping, graceful bowers bending down to the little\nlaughing stream that for the past hour had chuckled and gurgled like a\nfriendly water baby beside us.\n\nI had proven, almost to my own satisfaction, that what we had beheld\nhad been a creation of the extraordinary atmospheric attributes of these\nhighlands, an atmosphere so unique as to make almost anything of the\nkind possible. But Drake was not convinced.\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"Of course I understand all that--superimposed layers\nof warmer air that might have bent the ray; vortices in the higher\nlevels that might have produced just that effect of the captured aurora.\nI admit it's all possible. I'll even admit it's all probable, but damn\nme, Doc, if I BELIEVE it! I had too clearly the feeling of a CONSCIOUS\nforce, a something that KNEW exactly what it was doing--and had a REASON\nfor it.\"\n\nIt was mid-afternoon.\n\nThe spell of the valley upon us, we had gone leisurely. The western\nmount was close, the mouth of the gorge through which we must pass,\nnow plain before us. It did not seem as though we could reach it before\ndusk, and Drake and I were reconciled to spending another night in the\npeaceful vale. Plodding along, deep in thought, I was startled by his\nexclamation.\n\nHe was staring at a point some hundred yards to his right. I followed\nhis gaze.\n\nThe towering cliffs were a scant half mile away. At some distant time\nthere had been an enormous fall of rock. This, disintegrating, had\nformed a gently-curving breast which sloped down to merge with the\nvalley's floor. Willow and witch alder, stunted birch and poplar\nhad found roothold, clothed it, until only their crowding outposts,\nthrusting forward in a wavering semicircle, held back seemingly by the\nblue hordes, showed where it melted into the meadows.\n\nIn the center of this breast, beginning half way up its slopes and\nstretching down into the flowered fields was a colossal imprint.\n\nGray and brown, it stood out against the green and blue of slope and\nlevel; a rectangle all of thirty feet wide, two hundred long, the\nheel faintly curved and from its hither end, like claws, four slender\ntriangles radiating from it like twenty-four points of a ten-rayed star.\n\nIrresistibly was it like a footprint--but what thing was there whose\ntread could leave such a print as this?\n\nI ran up the slope--Drake already well in advance. I paused at the\nbase of the triangles where, were this thing indeed a footprint, the\nspreading claws sprang from the flat of it.\n\nThe track was fresh. At its upper edges were clipped bushes and split\ntrees, the white wood of the latter showing where they had been sliced\nas though by the stroke of a scimitar.\n\nI stepped out upon the mark. It was as level as though planed; bent down\nand stared in utter disbelief of what my own eyes beheld. For stone\nand earth had been crushed, compressed, into a smooth, microscopically\ngrained, adamantine complex, and in this matrix poppies still bearing\ntraces of their coloring were imbedded like fossils. A cyclone can and\ndoes grip straws and thrust them unbroken through an inch board--but\nwhat force was there which could take the delicate petals of a flower\nand set them like inlay within the surface of a stone?\n\nInto my mind came recollection of the wailings, the crashings in the\nnight, of the weird glow that had flashed about us when the mist arose\nto hide the chained aurora.\n\n\"It was what we heard,\" I said. \"The sounds--it was then that this was\nmade.\"\n\n\"The foot of Shin-je!\" Chiu-Ming's voice was tremulous. \"The lord of\nHell has trodden here!\"\n\nI translated for Drake's benefit.\n\n\"Has the lord of Hell but one foot?\" asked Dick, politely.\n\n\"He bestrides the mountains,\" said Chiu-Ming. \"On the far side is his\nother footprint. Shin-je it was who strode the mountains and set here\nhis foot.\"\n\nAgain I interpreted.\n\nDrake cast a calculating glance up to the cliff top.\n\n\"Two thousand feet, about,\" he mused. \"Well, if Shin-je is built in our\nproportions that makes it about right. The length of this thing would\ngive him just about a two thousand foot leg. Yes--he could just about\nstraddle that hill.\"\n\n\"You're surely not serious?\" I asked in consternation.\n\n\"What the hell!\" he exclaimed, \"am I crazy? This is no foot mark. How\ncould it be? Look at the mathematical nicety with which these edges are\nstamped out--as though by a die--\n\n\"That's what it reminds me of--a die. It's as if some impossible power\nhad been used to press it down. Like--like a giant seal of metal in a\nmountain's hand. A sigil--a seal--\"\n\n\"But why?\" I asked. \"What could be the purpose--\"\n\n\"Better ask where the devil such a force could be gotten together and\nhow it came here,\" he said. \"Look--except for this one place there isn't\na mark anywhere. All the bushes and the trees, all the poppies and the\ngrass are just as they ought to be.\n\n\"How did whoever or whatever it was that made this, get here and\nget away without leaving any trace but this? Damned if I don't think\nChiu-Ming's explanation puts less strain upon the credulity than any I\ncould offer.\"\n\nI peered about. It was so. Except for the mark, there was no slightest\nsign of the unusual, the abnormal.\n\nBut the mark was enough!\n\n\"I'm for pushing up a notch or two and getting into the gorge before\ndark,\" he was voicing my own thought. \"I'm willing to face anything\nhuman--but I'm not keen to be pressed into a rock like a flower in a\nmaiden's book of poems.\" Just at twilight we drew out of the valley into\nthe pass. We traveled a full mile along it before darkness forced us to\nmake camp. The gorge was narrow. The far walls but a hundred feet away;\nbut we had no quarrel with them for their neighborliness, no! Their\nsolidity, their immutability, breathed confidence back into us.\n\nAnd after we had found a deep niche capable of holding the entire\ncaravan we filed within, ponies and all, I for one perfectly willing\nthus to spend the night, let the air at dawn be what it would. We dined\nwithin on bread and tea, and then, tired to the bone, sought each his\nplace upon the rocky floor. I slept well, waking only once or twice\nby Chiu-Ming's groanings; his dreams evidently were none of the\npleasantest. If there was an aurora I neither knew nor cared. My slumber\nwas dreamless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. RUTH VENTNOR\n\nThe dawn, streaming into the niche, awakened us. A covey of partridges\nventuring too close yielded three to our guns. We breakfasted well, and\na little later were pushing on down the cleft.\n\nIts descent, though gradual, was continuous, and therefore I was not\nsurprised when soon we began to come upon evidences of semi-tropical\nvegetation. Giant rhododendrons and tree ferns gave way to occasional\nclumps of stately kopek and clumps of the hardier bamboos. We added a\nfew snow cocks to our larder--although they were out of their habitat,\nflying down into the gorge from their peaks and table-lands for some\nchoice tidbit.\n\nAll that day we marched on, and when at night we made camp, sleep came\nto us quickly and overmastering. An hour after dawn we were on our way.\nA brief stop we made for lunch; pressed forward.\n\nIt was close to two when we caught the first sight of the ruins.\n\nThe soaring, verdure-clad walls of the canyon had long been steadily\nmarching closer. Above, between their rims the wide ribbon of sky was\nlike a fantastically shored river, shimmering, dazzling; every cove\nand headland edged with an opalescent glimmering as of shining pearly\nbeaches.\n\nAnd as though we were sinking in that sky stream's depths its light\nkept lessening, darkening imperceptibly with luminous shadows of ghostly\nberyl, drifting veils of pellucid aquamarine, limpid mists of glaucous\nchrysolite.\n\nFainter, more crepuscular became the light, yet never losing its\ncrystalline quality. Now the high overhead river was but a brook; became\na thread. Abruptly it vanished.\n\nWe passed into a tunnel, fern walled, fern roofed, garlanded with tawny\norchids, gay with carmine fungus and golden moss. We stepped out into a\nblaze of sunlight.\n\nBefore us lay a wide green bowl held in the hands of the clustered\nhills; shallow, circular, as though, while plastic still, the thumb\nof God had run round its rim, shaping it. Around it the peaks crowded,\ncraning their lofty heads to peer within.\n\nIt was about a mile in its diameter, this hollow, as my gaze then\nmeasured it. It had three openings--one that lay like a crack in the\nnortheast slope; another, the tunnel mouth through which we had come.\nThe third lifted itself out of the bowl, creeping up the precipitous\nbare scarp of the western barrier straight to the north, clinging to the\nochreous rock up and up until it vanished around a far distant shoulder.\n\nIt was a wide and bulwarked road, a road that spoke as clearly as though\nit had tongue of human hands which had cut it there in the mountain's\nbreast. An ancient road weary beyond belief beneath the tread of\nuncounted years.\n\nFrom the hollow the blind soul of loneliness groped out to greet us!\n\nNever had I felt such loneliness as that which lapped the lip of the\nverdant bowl. It was tangible--as though it had been poured from some\nreservoir of misery. A pool of despair--\n\n\nHalf the width of the valley away the ruins began. Weirdly were they its\nvisible expression. They huddled in two bent rows to the bottom. They\ncrouched in a wide cluster against the cliffs. From the cluster a\ncurving row of them ran along the southern crest of the hollow.\n\nA flight of shattered, cyclopean steps lifted to a ledge and here a\ncrumbling fortress stood.\n\nIrresistibly did the ruins seem a colossal hag, flung prone, lying\nlistlessly, helplessly, against the barrier's base. The huddled lower\nranks were the legs, the cluster the body, the upper row an outflung\narm and above the neck of the stairway the ancient fortress, rounded\nand with two huge ragged apertures in its northern front was an aged,\nbleached and withered head staring, watching.\n\nI looked at Drake--the spell of the bowl was heavy upon him, his face\ndrawn. The Chinaman and Tibetan were murmuring, terror written large\nupon them.\n\n\"A hell of a joint!\" Drake turned to me, a shadow of a grin lightening\nthe distress on his face. \"But I'd rather chance it than go back. What\nd'you say?\"\n\nI nodded, curiosity mastering my oppression. We stepped over the rim,\nrifles on the alert. Close behind us crowded the two servants and the\nponies.\n\nThe vale was shallow, as I have said. We trod the fragments of an olden\napproach to the green tunnel so the descent was not difficult. Here and\nthere beside the path upreared huge broken blocks. On them I thought\nI could see faint tracings as of carvings--now a suggestion of gaping,\narrow-fanged dragon jaws, now the outline of a scaled body, a hint of\nenormous, batlike wings.\n\nNow we had reached the first of the crumbling piles that stretched down\ninto the valley's center.\n\nHalf fainting, I fell against Drake, clutching to him for support.\n\nA stream of utter hopelessness was racing upon us, swirling and eddying\naround us, reaching to our hearts with ghostly fingers dripping with\ndespair. From every shattered heap it seemed to pour, rushing down the\nroad upon us like a torrent, engulfing us, submerging, drowning.\n\nUnseen it was--yet tangible as water; it sapped the life from every\nnerve. Weariness filled me, a desire to drop upon the stones, to be\nrolled away. To die. I felt Drake's body quivering even as mine; knew\nthat he was drawing upon every reserve of strength.\n\n\"Steady,\" he muttered. \"Steady--\"\n\nThe Tibetan shrieked and fled, the ponies scrambling after him. Dimly\nI remembered that mine carried precious specimens; a surge of anger\npassed, beating back the anguish. I heard a sob from Chiu-Ming, saw him\ndrop.\n\nDrake stopped, drew him to his feet. We placed him between us, thrust\neach an arm through his own. Then, like swimmers, heads bent, we pushed\non, buffeting that inexplicable invisible flood.\n\nAs the path rose, its force lessened, my vitality grew, and the terrible\ndesire to yield and be swept away waned. Now we had reached the foot of\nthe cyclopean stairs, now we were half up them--and now as we struggled\nout upon the ledge on which the watching fortress stood, the clutching\nstream shoaled swiftly, the shoal became safe, dry land and the cheated,\nunseen maelstrom swirled harmlessly beneath us.\n\nWe stood erect, gasping for breath, again like swimmers who have fought\ntheir utmost and barely, so barely, won.\n\nThere was an almost imperceptible movement at the side of the ruined\nportal.\n\nOut darted a girl. A rifle dropped from her hands. Straight she sped\ntoward me.\n\nAnd as she ran I recognized her.\n\nRuth Ventnor!\n\nThe flying figure reached me, threw soft arms around my neck, was\nweeping in relieved gladness on my shoulder.\n\n\"Ruth!\" I cried. \"What on earth are YOU doing here?\"\n\n\"Walter!\" she sobbed. \"Walter Goodwin--Oh, thank God! Thank God!\"\n\nShe drew herself from my arms, catching her breath; laughed shakily.\n\nI took swift stock of her. Save for fear upon her, she was the same Ruth\nI had known three years before; wide, deep blue eyes that were now\nall seriousness, now sparkling wells of mischief; petite, rounded and\ntender; the fairest skin; an impudent little nose; shining clusters of\nintractable curls; all human, sparkling and sweet.\n\nDrake coughed, insinuatingly. I introduced him.\n\n\"I--I watched you struggling through that dreadful pit.\" She shuddered.\n\"I could not see who you were, did not know whether friend or enemy--but\noh, my heart almost died in pity for you, Walter,\" she breathed. \"What\ncan it be--THERE?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Martin could not see you,\" she went on. \"He was watching the road that\nleads above. But I ran down--to help.\"\n\n\"Mart watching?\" I asked. \"Watching for what?\"\n\n\"I--\" she hesitated oddly. \"I think I'd rather tell you before him. It's\nso strange--so incredible.\"\n\nShe led us through the broken portal and into the fortress. It was more\ngigantic even than I had thought. The floor of the vast chamber we\nhad entered was strewn with fragments fallen from the crackling,\nstone-vaulted ceiling. Through the breaks light streamed from the level\nabove us.\n\nWe picked our way among the debris to a wide crumbling stairway, crept\nup it, Ruth flitting ahead. We came out opposite one of the eye-like\napertures. Black against it, perched high upon a pile of blocks, I\nrecognized the long, lean outline of Ventnor, rifle in hand, gazing\nintently up the ancient road whose windings were plain through the\nopening. He had not heard us.\n\n\"Martin,\" called Ruth softly.\n\nHe turned. A shaft of light from a crevice in the gap's edge struck his\nface, flashing it out from the semidarkness of the corner in which he\ncrouched. I looked into the quiet gray eyes, upon the keen face.\n\n\"Goodwin!\" he shouted, tumbling down from his perch, shaking me by the\nshoulders. \"If I had been in the way of praying--you're the man I'd have\nprayed for. How did you get here?\"\n\n\"Just wandering, Mart,\" I answered. \"But Lord! I'm sure GLAD to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"Which way did you come?\" he asked, keenly. I threw my hand toward the\nsouth.\n\n\"Not through that hollow?\" he asked incredulously.\n\n\"And some hell of a place to get through,\" Drake broke in. \"It cost us\nour ponies and all my ammunition.\"\n\n\"Richard Drake,\" I said. \"Son of old Alvin--you knew him, Mart.\"\n\n\"Knew him well,\" cried Ventnor, seizing Dick's hand. \"Wanted me to go to\nKamchatka to get some confounded sort of stuff for one of his devilish\nexperiments. Is he well?\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" replied Dick soberly.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Ventnor. \"Oh--I'm sorry. He was a great man.\"\n\nBriefly I acquainted him with my wanderings, my encounter with Drake.\n\n\"That place out there--\" he considered us thoughtfully. \"Damned if I\nknow what it is. Thought maybe it's gas--of a sort. If it hadn't been\nfor it we'd have been out of this hole two days ago. I'm pretty sure it\nmust be gas. And it must be much less than it was this morning, for then\nwe made an attempt to get through again--and couldn't.\"\n\nI was hardly listening. Ventnor had certainly advanced a theory of our\nunusual symptoms that had not occurred to me. That hollow might indeed\nbe a pocket into which a gas flowed; just as in the mines the deadly\ncoal damp collects in pits, flows like a stream along the passages. It\nmight be that--some odorless, colorless gas of unknown qualities; and\nyet--\n\n\"Did you try respirators?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"Surely,\" said Ventnor. \"First off the go. But they weren't of any use.\nThe gas, if it is gas, seems to operate as well through the skin as\nthrough the nose and mouth. We just couldn't make it--and that's all\nthere is to it. But if you made it--could we try it now, do you think?\"\nhe asked eagerly.\n\nI felt myself go white.\n\n\"Not--not for a little while,\" I stammered.\n\nHe nodded, understandingly.\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"Well, we'll wait a bit, then.\"\n\n\"But why are you staying here? Why didn't you make for the road up the\nmountain? What are you watching for, anyway?\" asked Drake.\n\n\"Go to it, Ruth,\" Ventnor grinned. \"Tell 'em. After all--it was YOUR\nparty you know.\"\n\n\"Mart!\" she cried, blushing.\n\n\"Well--it wasn't ME they admired,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Martin!\" she cried again, and stamped her foot.\n\n\"Shoot,\" he said. \"I'm busy. I've got to watch.\"\n\n\"Well\"--Ruth's voice was uncertain--\"we'd been hunting up in Kashmir.\nMartin wanted to come over somewhere here. So we crossed the passes.\nThat was about a month ago. The fourth day out we ran across what looked\nlike a road running south.\n\n\"We thought we'd take it. It looked sort of old and lost--but it was\ngoing the way we wanted to go. It took us first into a country of little\nhills; then to the very base of the great range itself; finally into the\nmountains--and then it ran blank.\"\n\n\"Bing!\" interjected Ventnor, looking around for a moment. \"Bing--just\nlike that. Slap dash against a prodigious fall of rock. We couldn't get\nover it.\"\n\n\"So we cast about to find another road,\" went on Ruth. \"All we could\nstrike were--just strikes.\"\n\n\"No fish on the end of 'em,\" said Ventnor. \"God! But I'm glad to see\nyou, Walter Goodwin. Believe me, I am. However--go on, Ruth.\"\n\n\"At the end of the second week,\" she said, \"we knew we were lost. We\nwere deep in the heart of the range. All around us was a forest of\nenormous, snow-topped peaks. The gorges, the canyons, the valleys that\nwe tried led us east and west, north and south.\n\n\"It was a maze, and in it we seemed to be going ever deeper. There was\nnot the SLIGHTEST sign of human life. It was as though no human beings\nexcept ourselves had ever been there. Game was plentiful. We had no\ntrouble in getting food. And sooner or later, of course, we were bound\nto find our way out. We didn't worry.\n\n\"It was five nights ago that we camped at the head of a lovely little\nvalley. There was a mound that stood up like a tiny watch-tower, looking\ndown it. The trees grew round like tall sentinels.\n\n\"We built our fire in that mound; and after we had eaten, Martin slept.\nI sat watching the beauty of the skies and of the shadowy vale. I heard\nno one approach--but something made me leap to my feet, look behind me.\n\n\"A man was standing just within the glow of firelight, watching me.\"\n\n\"A Tibetan?\" I asked. She shook her head, trouble in her eyes.\n\n\"Not at all.\" Ventnor turned his head. \"Ruth screamed and awakened me. I\ncaught a glimpse of the fellow before he vanished.\n\n\"A short purple mantle hung from his shoulders. His chest was covered\nwith fine chain mail. His legs were swathed and bound by the thongs of\nhis high buskins. He carried a small, round, hide-covered shield and a\nshort two-edged sword. His head was helmeted. He belonged, in fact--oh,\nat least twenty centuries back.\"\n\nHe laughed in plain enjoyment of our amazement.\n\n\"Go on, Ruth,\" he said, and took up his watch.\n\n\"But Martin did not see his face,\" she went on. \"And oh, but I wish I\ncould forget it. It was as white as mine, Walter, and cruel, so cruel;\nthe eyes glowed and they looked upon me like a--like a slave dealer.\nThey shamed me--I wanted to hide myself.\n\n  \"I cried out and Martin awakened. As he moved, the\nman stepped out of the light and was gone. I think he had not seen\nMartin; had believed that I was alone.\n\n\"We put out the fire, moved farther into the shadow of the trees. But\nI could not sleep--I sat hour after hour, my pistol in my hand,\" she\npatted the automatic in her belt, \"my rifle close beside me.\n\n\"The hours went by--dreadfully. At last I dozed. When I awakened again\nit was dawn--and--and--\" she covered her eyes, then: \"TWO men were\nlooking down on me. One was he who had stood in the firelight.\"\n\n\"They were talking,\" interrupted Ventnor again, \"in archaic Persian.\"\n\n\"Persian,\" I repeated blankly; \"archaic Persian?\"\n\n\"Very much so,\" he nodded. \"I've a fair knowledge of the modern tongue,\nand a rather unusual command of Arabic. The modern Persian, as you know,\ncomes straight through from the speech of Xerxes, of Cyrus, of Darius\nwhom Alexander of Macedon conquered. It has been changed mainly by\ntaking on a load of Arabic words. Well--there wasn't a trace of the\nArabic in the tongue they were speaking.\n\n\"It sounded odd, of course--but I could understand quite easily. They\nwere talking about Ruth. To be explicit, they were discussing her with\nexceeding frankness--\"\n\n\"Martin!\" she cried wrathfully.\n\n\"Well, all right,\" he went on, half repentantly. \"As a matter of fact,\nI had seen the pair steal up. My rifle was under my hand. So I lay there\nquietly, listening.\n\n\"You can realize, Walter, that when I caught sight of those two,\nlooking as though they had materialized from Darius's ghostly hordes,\nmy scientific curiosity was aroused--prodigiously. So in my interest I\npassed over the matter of their speech; not alone because I thought\nRuth asleep but also because I took into consideration that the mode\nof polite expression changes with the centuries--and these gentlemen\nclearly belonged at least twenty centuries back--the real truth is I was\nconsumed with curiosity.\n\n\"They had got to a point where they were detailing with what pleasure a\ncertain mysterious person whom they seemed to regard with much fear and\nrespect would contemplate her. I was wondering how long my desire to\nobserve--for to the anthropologist they were most fascinating--could\nhold my hand back from my rifle when Ruth awakened.\n\n\"She jumped up like a little fury. Fired a pistol point blank at them.\nTheir amazement was--well--ludicrous. I know it seems incredible, but\nthey seemed to know nothing of firearms--they certainly acted as though\nthey didn't.\n\n\"They simply flew into the timber. I took a pistol shot at one but\nmissed. Ruth hadn't though; she had winged her man; he left a red trail\nbehind him.\n\n\"We didn't follow the trail. We made for the opposite direction--and as\nfast as possible.\n\n\"Nothing happened that day or night. Next morning, creeping up a slope,\nwe caught sight of a suspicious glitter a mile or two away in the\ndirection we were going. We sought shelter in a small ravine. In a\nlittle while, over the hill and half a mile away from us, came about two\nhundred of these fellows, marching along.\n\n\"And they were indeed Darius's men. Men of that Persia which had been\ndead for millenniums. There was no mistaking them, with their high,\ncovering shields, their great bows, their javelins and armor.\n\n\"They passed; we doubled. We built no fires that night--and we ought to\nhave turned the pony loose, but we didn't. It carried my instruments,\nand ammunition, and I felt we were going to need the latter.\n\n\"The next morning we caught sight of another band--or the same. We\nturned again. We stole through a tree-covered plain; we struck an\nancient road. It led south, into the peaks again. We followed it. It\nbrought us here.\n\n\"It isn't, as you observe, the most comfortable of places. We struck\nacross the hollow to the crevice--we knew nothing of the entrance\nyou came through. The hollow was not pleasant, either. But it was\npenetrable, then.\n\n\"We crossed. As we were about to enter the cleft there issued out of it\na most unusual and disconcerting chorus of sounds--wailings, crashings,\nsplinterings.\"\n\nI started, shot a look at Dick; absorbed, he was drinking in Ventnor's\nevery word.\n\n\"So unusual, so--well, disconcerting is the best word I can think of,\nthat we were not encouraged to proceed. Also the peculiar unpleasantness\nof the hollow was increasing rapidly.\n\n\"We made the best time we could back to the fortress. And when next\nwe tried to go through the hollow, to search for another outlet--we\ncouldn't. You know why,\" he ended abruptly.\n\n\"But men in ancient armor. Men like those of Darius.\" Dick broke the\nsilence that had followed this amazing recital. \"It's incredible!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Ventnor, \"isn't it. But there they were. Of course, I\ndon't maintain that they WERE relics of Darius's armies. They might have\nbeen of Xerxes before him--or of Artaxerxes after him. But there they\ncertainly were, Drake, living, breathing replicas of exceedingly ancient\nPersians.\n\n\"Why, they might have been the wall carvings on the tomb of Khosroes\ncome to life. I mention Darius because he fits in with the most\nplausible hypothesis. When Alexander the Great smashed his empire he did\nit rather thoroughly. There wasn't much sympathy for the vanquished\nin those days. And it's entirely conceivable that a city or two in\nAlexander's way might have gathered up a fleeting regiment or so for\nprotection and have decided not to wait for him, but to hunt for cover.\n\n\"Naturally, they would have gone into the almost inaccessible heart of\nthe high ranges. There is nothing impossible in the theory that they\nfound shelter at last up here. As long as history runs this has been\na well-nigh unknown land. Penetrating some mountain-guarded, easily\ndefended valley they might have decided to settle down for a time, have\nrebuilt a city, raised a government; laying low, in a sentence, waiting\nfor the storm to blow over.\n\n\"Why did they stay? Well, they might have found the new life more\npleasant than the old. And they might have been locked in their valley\nby some accident--landslides, rockfalls sealing up the entrance. There\nare a dozen reasonable possibilities.\"\n\n\"But those who hunted you weren't locked in,\" objected Drake.\n\n\"No,\" Ventnor grinned ruefully. \"No, they certainly weren't. Maybe we\ndrifted into their preserves by a way they don't know. Maybe they've\nfound another way out. I'm sure I don't know. But I DO know what I saw.\"\n\n\"The noises, Martin,\" I said, for his description of these had been the\ndescription of those we had heard in the blue valley. \"Have you heard\nthem since?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, hesitating oddly.\n\n\"And you think those--those soldiers you saw are still hunting for you?\"\n\n\"Haven't a doubt of it,\" he replied more cheerfully. \"They didn't look\nlike chaps who would give up a hunt easily--at least not a hunt for such\nnovel, interesting, and therefore desirable and delectable game as we\nmust have appeared to them.\"\n\n\"Martin,\" I said decisively, \"where's your pony? We'll try the hollow\nagain, at once. There's Ruth--and we'd never be able to hold back such\nnumbers as you've described.\"\n\n\"You feel strong enough to try it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. METAL WITH A BRAIN\n\nThe eagerness, the relief in his voice betrayed the tension, the anxiety\nwhich until now he had hidden so well; and hot shame burned me for my\nshrinking, my dread of again passing through that haunted vale.\n\n\"I certainly DO.\" I was once more master of myself. \"Drake--don't you\nagree?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he replied. \"Sure. I'll look after Ruth--er--I mean Miss\nVentnor.\"\n\nThe glint of amusement in Ventnor's eyes at this faded abruptly; his\nface grew somber.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said. \"I carried away some--some exhibits from the crevice of\nthe noises, Goodwin.\"\n\n\"What kind of exhibits?\" I asked, eagerly.\n\n\"Put 'em where they'd be safe,\" he continued. \"I've an idea they're far\nmore curious than our armored men--and of far more importance. At any\nrate, we must take them with us.\n\n\"Go with Ruth, you and Drake, and look at them. And bring them back with\nthe pony. Then we'll make a start. A few minutes more probably won't\nmake much difference--but hurry.\"\n\nHe turned back to his watch. Ordering Chiu-Ming to stay with him I\nfollowed Ruth and Drake down the ruined stairway. At the bottom she came\nto me, laid little hands on my shoulders.\n\n\"Walter,\" she breathed, \"I'm frightened. I'm so frightened I'm afraid to\ntell even Mart. He doesn't like them, either, these little things you're\ngoing to see. He likes them so little that he's afraid to let me know\nhow little he does like them.\"\n\n\"But what are they? What's to fear about them?\" asked Drake.\n\n\"See what you think!\" She led us slowly, almost reluctantly toward the\nrear of the fortress. \"They lay in a little heap at the mouth of the\ncleft where we heard the noises. Martin picked them up and dropped them\nin a sack before we ran through the hollow.\n\n\"They're grotesque and they're almost CUTE, and they make me feel as\nthough they were the tiniest tippy-tip of the claw of some incredibly\nlarge cat just stealing around the corner, a terrible cat, a cat as big\nas a mountain,\" she ended breathlessly.\n\nWe climbed through the crumbling masonry into a central, open court.\nHere a clear spring bubbled up in a ruined and choked stone basin; close\nto the ancient well was their pony, contentedly browsing in the thick\ngrass that grew around it. From one of its hampers Ruth took a large\ncloth bag.\n\n\"To carry them,\" she said, and trembled.\n\nWe passed through what had once been a great door into another chamber\nlarger than that we had just left; and it was in better preservation,\nthe ceiling unbroken, the light dim after the blazing sun of the court.\nNear its center she halted us.\n\nBefore me ran a two-feet-wide ragged crack, splitting the floor and\ndropping down into black depths. Beyond was an expanse of smooth\nflagging, almost clear of debris.\n\nDrake gave a low whistle. I followed his pointing finger. In the wall\nat the end whirled two enormous dragon shapes, cut in low relief. Their\ngigantic wings, their monstrous coils, covered the nearly unbroken\nsurface, and these CHIMERAE were the shapes upon the upthrust blocks of\nthe haunted roadway.\n\nIn Ruth's gaze I read a nameless fear, a half shuddering fascination.\n\nBut she was not looking at the cavern dragons.\n\nHer gaze was fixed upon what at my first glance seemed to be a raised\nand patterned circle in the dust-covered floor. Not more than a foot in\nwidth, it shone wanly with a pale, metallic bluish luster, as though,\nI thought, it had been recently polished. Compared with the wall's\ntremendous winged figures this floor design was trivial, ludicrously\ninsignificant. What could there be about it to stamp that dread upon\nRuth's face?\n\nI leaped the crevice; Dick joined me. Now I could see that the ring was\nnot continuous. Its broken circle was made of sharply edged cubes about\nan inch in height, separated from each other with mathematical exactness\nby another inch of space. I counted them--there were nineteen.\n\nAlmost touching them with their bases were an equal number of pyramids,\nof tetrahedrons, as sharply angled and of similar length. They lay on\ntheir sides with tips pointing starlike to six spheres clustered like\na conventionalized five petaled primrose in the exact center. Five of\nthese spheres--the petals--were, I roughly calculated, about an inch and\na half in diameter, the ball they enclosed larger by almost an inch.\n\nSo orderly was their arrangement, so much like a geometrical design\nnicely done by some clever child that I hesitated to disturb it. I bent,\nand stiffened, the first touch of dread upon me.\n\nFor within the ring, close to the clustering globes, was a miniature\nreplica of the giant track in the poppied valley!\n\nIt stood out from the dust with the same hint of crushing force, the\nsame die cut sharpness, the same METALLIC suggestion--and pointing\ntoward the globes were the claw marks of the four spreading star points.\n\nI reached down and picked up one of the pyramids. It seemed to cling\nto the rock; it was with effort that I wrenched it away. It gave to the\ntouch a slight sensation of warmth--how can I describe it?--a warmth\nthat was living.\n\nI weighed it in my hand. It was oddly heavy, twice the weight, I should\nsay, of platinum. I drew out a glass and examined it. Decidedly the\npyramid was metallic, but of finest, almost silken texture--and I could\nnot place it among any of the known metals. It certainly was none I\nhad ever seen; yet it was as certainly metal. It was striated--slender\nfilaments radiating from tiny, dully lustrous points within the polished\nsurface.\n\nAnd suddenly I had the weird feeling that each of these points was an\neye, peering up at me, scrutinizing me. There came a startled cry from\nDick.\n\n\"Look at the ring!\"\n\nThe ring was in motion!\n\nFaster the cubes moved; faster the circle revolved; the pyramids raised\nthemselves, stood bolt upright on their square bases; the six rolling\nspheres touched them, joined the spinning, and with sleight-of-hand\nsuddenness the ring drew together; its units coalesced, cubes and\npyramids and globes threading with a curious suggestion of ferment.\n\nWith the same startling abruptness there stood erect, where but a moment\nbefore they had seethed, a little figure, grotesque; a weirdly humorous,\na vaguely terrifying foot-high shape, squared and angled and pointed and\nANIMATE--as though a child should build from nursery blocks a fantastic\nshape which abruptly is filled with throbbing life.\n\nA troll from the kindergarten! A kobold of the toys!\n\nOnly for a second it stood, then began swiftly to change, melting\nwith quicksilver quickness from one outline into another as square\nand triangle and spheres changed places. Their shiftings were like the\ntransformations one sees within a kaleidoscope. And in each vanishing\nform was the suggestion of unfamiliar harmonies, of a subtle, a\ntranscendental geometric art as though each swift shaping were a symbol,\na WORD--\n\nEuclid's problems given volition!\n\nGeometry endowed with consciousness!\n\nIt ceased. Then the cubes drew one upon the other until they formed\na pedestal nine inches high; up this pillar rolled the larger globe,\nbalanced itself upon the top; the five spheres followed it, clustered\nlike a ring just below it. The other cubes raced up, clicked two by two\non the outer arc of each of the five balls; at the ends of these twin\nblocks a pyramid took its place, tipping each with a point.\n\nThe Lilliputian fantasy was now a pedestal of cubes surmounted by a ring\nof globes from which sprang a star of five arms.\n\nThe spheres began to revolve. Faster and faster they spun around the\nbase of the crowning globe; the arms became a disc upon which tiny\nbrilliant sparks appeared, clustered, vanished only to reappear in\ngreater number.\n\nThe troll swept toward me. It GLIDED. The finger of panic touched me. I\nsprang aside, and swift as light it followed, seemed to poise itself to\nleap.\n\n\"Drop it!\" It was Ruth's cry.\n\nBut, before I could let fall the pyramid I had forgotten was in my hand,\nthe little figure touched me and a paralyzing shock ran through me. My\nfingers clenched, locked. I stood, muscle and nerve bound, unable to\nmove.\n\nThe little figure paused. Its whirling disc shifted from the horizontal\nplane on which it spun. It was as though it cocked its head to look up\nat me--and again I had the sense of innumerable eyes peering at me. It\ndid not seem menacing--its attitude was inquisitive, waiting; almost as\nthough it had asked for something and wondered why I did not let it have\nit. The shock still held me rigid, although a tingle in every nerve told\nme of returning force.\n\nThe disc tilted back to place, bent toward me again. I heard a shout;\nheard a bullet strike the pigmy that now clearly menaced; heard the\nbullet ricochet without the slightest effect upon it. Dick leaped beside\nme, raised a foot and kicked at the thing. There was a flash of light\nand upon the instant he crashed down as though struck by a giant hand,\nlay sprawling and inert upon the floor.\n\nThere was a scream from Ruth; there was softly sibilant rustling all\nabout her. I saw her leap the crevice, drop on her knees beside Drake.\n\nThere was movement on the flagging where she stood. A score or more of\nfaintly shining, bluish shapes were marching there--pyramids and cubes\nand spheres like those forming the shape that stood before me. There was\na curious sharp tang of ozone in the air, a perceptible tightening as of\nelectrical tension.\n\nThey swept to the edge of the fissure, swam together, and there, hanging\nhalf over the gap was a bridge, half spanning it, a weird and fairy arch\nmade up of alternate cube and angle. The shape at my feet disintegrated;\nresolved itself into units that raced over to the beckoning span.\n\nAt the hither side of the crack they clicked into place, even as had the\nothers. Before me now was a bridge complete except for the one arc near\nthe middle where an angled gap marred it.\n\nI felt the little object I held pulse within my hand, striving to\nescape. I dropped it. The tiny shape swept to the bridge, ascended\nit--dropped into the gap.\n\nThe arch was complete--hanging in one flying span over the depths!\n\nUpon it, over it, as though they had but awaited this completion, rolled\nthe six globes. And as they dropped to the farther side the end of the\nbridge nearest me raised itself in air, curved itself like a scorpion's\ntail, drew itself into a closer circled arc, and dropped upon the floor\nbeyond.\n\nAgain the sibilant rustling--and cubes and pyramids and spheres were\ngone.\n\nNerves tingling slowly back to life, mazed in absolute bewilderment,\nmy gaze sought Drake. He was sitting up, feebly, his head supported by\nRuth's hands.\n\n\"Goodwin!\" he whispered. \"What--what were they?\"\n\n\"Metal,\" I said--it was the only word to which my whirling mind could\ncling--\"metal--\"\n\n\"Metal!\" he echoed. \"These things metal? Metal--ALIVE AND THINKING!\"\n\nSuddenly he was silent, his face a page on which, visibly, dread\ngathered slowly and ever deeper.\n\nAnd as I looked at Ruth, white-faced, and at him, I knew that my own was\nas pallid, as terror-stricken as theirs.\n\n\"They were such LITTLE THINGS,\" muttered Drake. \"Such little\nthings--bits of metal--little globes and pyramids and cubes--just little\nTHINGS.\"\n\n\"Babes! Only babes!\" It was Ruth--\"BABES!\"\n\n\"Bits of metal\"--Dick's gaze sought mine, held it--\"and they looked for\neach other, they worked with each other--THINKINGLY, CONSCIOUSLY--they\nwere deliberate, purposeful--little things--and with the force of a\nscore of dynamos--living, THINKING--\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Ruth laid white hands over his eyes. \"Don't--don't YOU be\nfrightened!\"\n\n\"Frightened?\" he echoed. \"I'M not afraid--yes, I AM afraid--\"\n\nHe arose, stiffly--and stumbled toward me.\n\nAfraid? Drake afraid. Well--so was I. Bitterly, TERRIBLY afraid.\n\nFor what we had beheld in the dusk of that dragoned, ruined chamber was\noutside all experience, beyond all knowledge or dream of science. Not\ntheir shapes--that was nothing. Not even that, being metal, they had\nmoved.\n\nBut that being metal, they had moved consciously, thoughtfully,\ndeliberately.\n\nThey were metal things with--MINDS!\n\nThat--that was the incredible, the terrifying thing. That--and their\npower.\n\nThor compressed within Hop-o'-my-thumb--and thinking. The lightnings\nincarnate in metal minacules--and thinking.\n\nThe inert, the immobile, given volition, movement,\ncognoscence--thinking.\n\nMetal with a brain!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE SMITING THING\n\nSilently we looked at each other, and silently we passed out of the\ncourtyard. The dread was heavy upon me. The twilight was stealing upon\nthe close-clustered peaks. Another hour, and their amethyst-and-purple\nmantles would drop upon them; snowfields and glaciers sparkle out in\nirised beauty; nightfall.\n\nAs I gazed upon them I wondered to what secret place within their\nbrooding immensities the little metal mysteries had fled. And to what\nmyriads, it might be, of their kind? And these hidden hordes--of what\nshapes were they? Of what powers? Small like these, or--or--\n\nQuick on the screen of my mind flashed two pictures, side by side--the\nlittle four-rayed print in the great dust of the crumbling ruin and its\ncolossal twin on the breast of the poppied valley.\n\nI turned aside, crept through the shattered portal and looked over the\nhaunted hollow.\n\nUnbelieving, I rubbed my eyes; then leaped to the very brim of the bowl.\n\nA lark had risen from the roof of one of the shattered heaps and had\nflown caroling up into the shadowy sky.\n\nA flock of the little willow warblers flung themselves across the\nvalley, scolding and gossiping; a hare sat upright in the middle of the\nancient roadway.\n\nThe valley itself lay serenely under the ambering light, smiling,\npeaceful--emptied of horror!\n\nI dropped over the side, walked cautiously down the road up which but\nan hour or so before we had struggled so desperately; paced farther and\nfarther with an increasing confidence and a growing wonder.\n\nGone was that soul of loneliness; vanished the whirlpool of despair that\nhad striven to drag us down to death.\n\nThe bowl was nothing but a quiet, smiling lovely little hollow in the\nhills. I looked back. Even the ruins had lost their sinister shape; were\ntime-worn, crumbling piles--nothing more.\n\nI saw Ruth and Drake run out upon the ledge and beckon me; made my way\nback to them, running.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I shouted. \"The place is all right.\"\n\nI stumbled up the side; joined them.\n\n\"It's empty,\" I cried. \"Get Martin and Chiu-Ming quick! While the way's\nopen--\"\n\nA rifle-shot rang out above us; another and another. From the portal\nscampered Chiu-Ming, his robe tucked up about his knees.\n\n\"They come!\" he gasped. \"They come!\"\n\nThere was a flashing of spears high up the winding mountain path. Down\nit was pouring an avalanche of men. I caught the glint of helmets and\ncorselets. Those in the van were mounted, galloping two abreast upon\nsure-footed mountain ponies. Their short swords, lifted high, flickered.\n\nAfter the horsemen swarmed foot soldiers, a forest of shining points and\ndully gleaming pikes above them. Clearly to us came their battlecries.\n\nAgain Ventnor's rifle cracked. One of the foremost riders went down;\nanother stumbled over him, fell. The rush was checked for an instant,\nmilling upon the road.\n\n\"Dick,\" I cried, \"rush Ruth over to the tunnel mouth. We'll follow. We\ncan hold them there. I'll get Martin. Chiu-Ming, after the pony, quick.\"\n\nI pushed the two over the rim of the hollow. Side by side the Chinaman\nand I ran back through the gateway. I pointed to the animal and rushed\nback into the fortress.\n\n\"Quick, Mart!\" I shouted up the shattered stairway. \"We can get through\nthe hollow. Ruth and Drake are on their way to the break we came\nthrough. Hurry!\"\n\n\"All right. Just a minute,\" he called.\n\nI heard him empty his magazine with almost machine-gun quickness.\nThere was a short pause, and down the broken steps he leaped, gray eyes\nblazing.\n\n\"The pony?\" He ran beside me toward the portal. \"All my ammunition is on\nhim.\"\n\n\"Chiu-Ming's taking care of that,\" I gasped.\n\nWe darted out of the gateway. A good five hundred yards away were Ruth\nand Drake, running straight to the green tunnel's mouth. Between them\nand us was Chiu-Ming urging on the pony.\n\nAs we sped after him I looked back. The horsemen had recovered, were\nnow a scant half-mile from where the road swept past the fortress. I saw\nthat with their swords the horsemen bore great bows. A little cloud of\narrows sparkled from them; fell far short.\n\n\"Don't look back,\" grunted Ventnor. \"Stretch yourself, Walter. There's a\nsurprise coming. Hope to God I judged the time right.\"\n\nWe turned off the ruined way; raced over the sward.\n\n\"If it looks as though--we can't make it,\" he panted, \"YOU beat it after\nthe rest. I'll try to hold 'em until you get into the tunnel. Never do\nfor 'em to get Ruth.\"\n\n\"Right.\" My own breathing was growing labored, \"WE'LL hold them. Drake\ncan take care of Ruth.\"\n\n\"Good boy,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have asked you. It probably means\ndeath.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I gasped, irritated. \"But why borrow trouble?\"\n\nHe reached out, touched me.\n\n\"You're right, Walter,\" he grinned. \"It does--seem--like carrying\ncoals--to Newcastle.\"\n\nThere was a thunderous booming behind us; a shattering crash. A cloud of\nsmoke and dust hung over the northern end of the ruined fortress.\n\nIt lifted swiftly, and I saw that the whole side of the structure had\nfallen, littering the road with its fragments. Scattered prone among\nthese were men and horses; others staggered, screaming. On the farther\nside of this stony dike our pursuers were held like rushing waters\nbehind a sudden fallen tree.\n\n\"Timed to a second!\" cried Ventnor. \"Hold 'em for a while. Fuses and\ndynamite. Blew out the whole side, right on 'em, by the Lord!\"\n\nOn we fled. Chiu-Ming was now well in advance; Ruth and Dick less than\nhalf a mile from the opening of the green tunnel. I saw Drake stop,\nraise his rifle, empty it before him, and, holding Ruth by the hand,\nrace back toward us.\n\nEven as he turned, the vine-screened entrance through which we had come,\nthrough which we had thought lay safety, streamed other armored men. We\nwere outflanked.\n\n\"To the fissure!\" shouted Ventnor. Drake heard, for he changed\nhis course to the crevice at whose mouth Ruth had said the--Little\nThings--had lain.\n\nAfter him streaked Chiu-Ming, urging on the pony. Shouting out of the\ntunnel, down over the lip of the bowl, leaped the soldiers. We dropped\nupon our knees, sent shot after shot into them. They fell back,\nhesitated. We sprang up, sped on.\n\nAll too short was the check, but once more we held them--and again.\n\nNow Ruth and Dick were a scant fifty yards from the crevice. I saw him\nstop, push her from him toward it. She shook her head.\n\nNow Chiu-Ming was with them. Ruth sprang to the pony, lifted from its\nback a rifle. Then into the mass of their pursuers Drake and she poured\na fusillade. They huddled, wavered, broke for cover.\n\n\"A chance!\" gasped Ventnor.\n\nBehind us was a wolflike yelping. The first pack had re-formed; had\ncrossed the barricade the dynamite had made; was rushing upon us.\n\nI ran as I had never known I could. Over us whined the bullets from\nthe covering guns. Close were we now to the mouth of the fissure. If\nwe could but reach it. Close, close were our pursuers, too--the arrows\ncloser.\n\n\"No use!\" said Ventnor. \"We can't make it. Meet 'em from the front.\nDrop--and shoot.\"\n\nWe threw ourselves down, facing them. There came a triumphant shouting.\nAnd in that strange sharpening of the senses that always goes hand\nin hand with deadly peril, that is indeed nature's summoning of every\nreserve to meet that peril, my eyes took them in with photographic\nnicety--the linked mail, lacquered blue and scarlet, of the horsemen;\nbrown, padded armor of the footmen; their bows and javelins and short\nbronze swords, their pikes and shields; and under their round helmets\ntheir cruel, bearded faces--white as our own where the black beards did\nnot cover them; their fierce and mocking eyes.\n\nThe springs of ancient Persia's long dead power, these. Men of Xerxes's\nruthless, world-conquering hordes; the lustful, ravening wolves of\nDarius whom Alexander scattered--in this world of ours twenty centuries\nbeyond their time!\n\nSwiftly, accurately, even as I scanned them, we had been drilling into\nthem. They advanced deliberately, heedless of their fallen. Their arrows\nhad ceased to fly. I wondered why, for now we were well within their\nrange. Had they orders to take us alive--at whatever cost to themselves?\n\n\"I've got only about ten cartridges left, Martin,\" I told him.\n\n\"We've saved Ruth anyway,\" he said. \"Drake ought to be able to hold that\nhole in the wall. He's got lots of ammunition on the pony. But they've\ngot us.\"\n\nAnother wild shouting; down swept the pack.\n\nWe leaped to our feet, sent our last bullets into them; stood ready,\nrifles clubbed to meet the rush. I heard Ruth scream--\n\nWhat was the matter with the armored men? Why had they halted? What was\nit at which they were glaring over our heads? And why had the rifle fire\nof Ruth and Drake ceased so abruptly?\n\nSimultaneously we turned.\n\nWithin the black background of the fissure stood a shape, an apparition,\na woman--beautiful, awesome, incredible!\n\nShe was tall, standing there swathed from chin to feet in clinging veils\nof pale amber, she seemed taller even than tall Drake. Yet it was not\nher height that sent through me the thrill of awe, of half incredulous\nterror which, relaxing my grip, let my smoking rifle drop to earth; nor\nwas it that about her proud head a cloud of shining tresses swirled\nand pennoned like a misty banner of woven copper flames--no, nor that\nthrough her veils her body gleamed faint radiance.\n\nIt was her eyes--her great, wide eyes whose clear depths were like\npools of living star fires. They shone from her white face--not\nphosphorescent, not merely lucent and light reflecting, but as though\nthey themselves were SOURCES of the cold white flames of far stars--and\nas calm as those stars themselves.\n\nAnd in that face, although as yet I could distinguish nothing but the\neyes, I sensed something unearthly.\n\n\"God!\" whispered Ventnor. \"What IS she?\"\n\nThe woman stepped from the crevice. Not fifty feet from her were Ruth\nand Drake and Chiu-Ming, their rigid attitudes revealing the same shock\nof awe that had momentarily paralyzed me.\n\nShe looked at them, beckoned them. I saw the two walk toward her,\nChiu-Ming hang back. The great eyes fell upon Ventnor and myself. She\nraised a hand, motioned us to approach.\n\nI turned. There stood the host that had poured down the mountain road,\nhorsemen, spearsmen, pikemen--a full thousand of them. At my right were\nthe scattered company that had come from the tunnel entrance, threescore\nor more.\n\nThere seemed a spell upon them. They stood in silence, like automatons,\nonly their fiercely staring eyes showing that they were alive.\n\n\"Quick,\" breathed Ventnor.\n\nWe ran toward her who had checked death even while its jaws were closing\nupon us.\n\nBefore we had gone half-way, as though our flight had broken whatever\nbonds had bound them, a clamor arose from the host; a wild shouting,\na clanging of swords on shields. I shot a glance behind. They were in\nmotion, advancing slowly, hesitatingly as yet--but I knew that soon that\nhesitation would pass; that they would sweep down upon us, engulf us.\n\n\"To the crevice,\" I shouted to Drake. He paid no heed to me, nor did\nRuth--their gaze fastened upon the swathed woman.\n\nVentnor's hand shot out, gripped my shoulder, halted me. She had thrown\nup her head. The cloudy METALLIC hair billowed as though wind had blown\nit.\n\nFrom the lifted throat came a low, a vibrant cry; harmonious, weirdly\ndisquieting, golden and sweet--and laden with the eery, minor wailings\nof the blue valley's night, the dragoned chamber.\n\nBefore the cry had ceased there poured with incredible swiftness out of\nthe crevice score upon score of the metal things. The fissures vomited\nthem!\n\nGlobes and cubes and pyramids--not small like those of the ruins, but\nshapes all of four feet high, dully lustrous, and deep within that\nluster the myriads of tiny points of light like unwinking, staring eyes.\n\nThey swirled, eddied and formed a barricade between us and the armored\nmen.\n\nDown upon them poured a shower of arrows from the soldiers. I heard the\nshouts of their captains; they rushed. They had courage--those men--yes!\n\nAgain came the woman's cry--golden, peremptory.\n\nSphere and block and pyramid ran together, seemed to seethe. I had\nagain that sense of a quicksilver melting. Up from them thrust a thick\nrectangular column. Eight feet in width and twenty feet high, it shaped\nitself. Out from its left side, from right side, sprang arms--fearful\narms that grew and grew as globe and cube and angle raced up the\ncolumn's side and clicked into place each upon, each after, the other.\nWith magical quickness the arms lengthened.\n\nBefore us stood a monstrous shape; a geometric prodigy. A shining angled\npillar that, though rigid, immobile, seemed to crouch, be instinct with\nliving force striving to be unleashed.\n\nTwo great globes surmounted it--like the heads of some two-faced Janus\nof an alien world.\n\nAt the left and right the knobbed arms, now fully fifty feet in\nlength, writhed, twisted, straightened; flexing themselves in grotesque\nimitation of a boxer. And at the end of each of the six arms the spheres\nwere clustered thick, studded with the pyramids--again in gigantic,\nawful, parody of the spiked gloves of those ancient gladiators who\nfought for imperial Nero.\n\nFor an instant it stood here, preening, testing itself like an\nathlete--a chimera, amorphous yet weirdly symmetric--under the darkening\nsky, in the green of the hollow, the armored hosts frozen before it--\n\nAnd then--it struck!\n\nOut flashed two of the arms, with a glancing motion, with appalling\nforce. They sliced into the close-packed forward ranks of the armored\nmen; cut out of them two great gaps.\n\nSickened, I saw fragments of man and horse fly. Another arm javelined\nfrom its place like a flying snake, clicked at the end of another,\nbecame a hundred-foot chain which swirled like a flail through the\nhuddling mass. Down upon a knot of the soldiers with a straight-forward\nblow drove a third arm, driving through them like a giant punch.\n\nAll that host which had driven us from the ruins threw down sword,\nspear, and pike; fled shrieking. The horsemen spurred their mounts,\nriding heedless over the footmen who fled with them.\n\nThe Smiting Thing seemed to watch them go with--AMUSEMENT!\n\nBefore they could cover a hundred yards it had disintegrated. I heard\nthe little wailing sounds--then behind the fleeing men, close behind\nthem, rose the angled pillar; into place sprang the flexing arms, and\nagain it took its toll of them.\n\nThey scattered, running singly, by twos, in little groups, for the sides\nof the valley. They were like rats scampering in panic over the bottom\nof a great green bowl. And like a monstrous cat the shape played with\nthem--yes, PLAYED.\n\nIt melted once more--took new form. Where had been pillar and flailing\narms was now a tripod thirty feet high, its legs alternate globe and\ncube and upon its apex a wide and spinning ring of sparkling spheres.\nOut from the middle of this ring stretched a tentacle--writhing,\nundulating like a serpent of steel, four score yards at least in length.\n\nAt its end cube, globe and pyramid had mingled to form a huge trident.\nWith the three long prongs of this trident the thing struck, swiftly,\nwith fearful precision--JOYOUSLY--tining those who fled, forking them,\ntossing them from its points high in air.\n\nIt was, I think, that last touch of sheer horror, the playfulness of the\nSmiting Thing, that sent my dry tongue to the roof of my terror-parched\nmouth, and held open with monstrous fascination eyes that struggled to\nclose.\n\nEver the armored men fled from it, and ever was it swifter than they,\nteetering at their heels on its tripod legs.\n\nFrom half its length the darting snake streamed red rain.\n\nI heard a sigh from Ruth; wrested my gaze from the hollow; turned. She\nlay fainting in Drake's arms.\n\nBeside the two the swathed woman stood, looking out upon that slaughter,\ncalm and still, shrouded with an unearthly tranquillity--viewing it, it\ncame to me, with eyes impersonal, cold, indifferent as the untroubled\nstars which look down upon hurricane and earthquake in this world of\nours.\n\nThere was a rushing of many feet at our left; a wail from Chiu-Ming.\nWere they maddened by fear, driven by despair, determined to slay before\nthey themselves were slain? I do not know. But those who still lived of\nthe men from the tunnel mouth were charging us.\n\nThey clustered close, their shields held before them. They had no bows,\nthese men. They moved swiftly down upon us in silence--swords and pikes\ngleaming.\n\nThe Smiting Thing rocked toward us, the metal tentacle straining out\nlike a rigid, racing serpent, flying to cut between its weird mistress\nand those who menaced her.\n\nI heard Chiu-Ming scream; saw him throw up his hands, cover his\neyes--run straight upon the pikes!\n\n\"Chiu-Ming!\" I shouted. \"Chiu-Ming! This way!\"\n\nI ran toward him. Before I had gone five paces Ventnor flashed by me,\nrevolver spitting. I saw a spear thrown. It struck the Chinaman squarely\nin the breast. He tottered--fell upon his knees.\n\nEven as he dropped, the giant flail swept down upon the soldiers. It\nswept through them like a scythe through ripe grain. It threw them,\nbroken and torn, far toward the valley's sloping sides. It left only\nfragments that bore no semblance to men.\n\nVentnor was at Chiu-Ming's head; I dropped beside him. There was a\ncrimson froth upon his lips.\n\n\"I thought that Shin-Je was about to slay us,\" he whispered. \"Fear\nblinded me.\"\n\nHis head dropped; his body quivered, lay still.\n\nWe arose, looked about us dazedly. At the side of the crevice stood the\nwoman, her gaze resting upon Drake, his arms about Ruth, her head hidden\non his breast.\n\nThe valley was empty--save for the huddled heaps that dotted it.\n\nHigh up on the mountain path a score of figures crept, all that were\nleft of those who but a little before had streamed down to take us\ncaptive or to slay. High up in the darkening heavens the lammergeiers,\nthe winged scavengers of the Himalayas, were gathering.\n\nThe woman lifted her hand, beckoned us once more. Slowly we walked\ntoward her, stood before her. The great clear eyes searched us--but no\nmore intently than our own wondering eyes did her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. NORHALA OF THE LIGHTNINGS\n\nWe looked upon a vision of loveliness such, I think, as none has beheld\nsince Trojan Helen was a maid. At first all I could note were the eyes,\nclear as rain-washed April skies, crystal clear as some secret spring\nsacred to crescented Diana. Their wide gray irises were flecked with\ngolden amber and sapphire--flecks that shone like clusters of little\naureate and azure stars.\n\nThen with a strange thrill of wonder I saw that these tiny\nconstellations were not in the irises alone; that they clustered even\nwithin the pupils--deep within them, like far-flung stars in the depths\nof velvety, midnight heavens.\n\nWhence had come those cold fires that had flared from them, I\nwondered--more menacing, far more menacing, in their cold tranquillity\nthan the hot flames of wrath? These eyes were not perilous--no. Calm\nthey were and still--yet in them a shadow of interest flickered; a ghost\nof friendliness smiled.\n\nAbove them were level, delicately penciled brows of bronze. The lips\nwere coral crimson and--asleep. Sweet were those lips as ever master\npainter, dreaming his dream of the very soul of woman's sweetness,\nsaw in vision and limned upon his canvas--and asleep, nor wistful for\nawakening.\n\nA proud, straight nose; a broad low brow, and over it the masses of the\ntendriling tresses--tawny, lustrous topaz, cloudy, METALLIC. Like spun\nsilk of ruddy copper; and misty as the wisps of cloud that Soul'tze,\nGoddess of Sleep, sets in the skies of dawn to catch the wandering\ndreams of lovers.\n\nDown from the wondrous face melted the rounded column of her throat\nto merge into exquisite curves of shoulders and breasts, half revealed\nbeneath the swathing veils.\n\nBut upon that face, within her eyes, kissing her red lips and clothing\nher breasts, was something unearthly.\n\nSomething that came straight out of the still mysteries of the\nstar-filled spaces; out of the ordered, the untroubled, the illimitable\nvoid.\n\nA passionless spirit that watched over the human passion in the scarlet\nmouth, in every slumbering, sculptured line of her--guarding her against\nits awakening.\n\nTwilight calm dropping down from the sun sleep to still the restless\nmountain tarn. Ishtar dreamlessly asleep within Nirvana.\n\nSomething not of this world we know--and yet of it as the winds of the\nCosmos are to the summer breeze, the ocean to the wave, the lightnings\nto the glowworm.\n\n\"She isn't--human,\" I heard Ventnor whispering at my ear. \"Look at her\neyes; look at the skin of her--\"\n\nHer skin was white as milk of pearls; gossamer fine, silken and creamy;\ntranslucent as though a soft brilliancy dwelt within it. Beside it\nRuth's fair skin was like some sun-and-wind-roughened country lass's to\nTitania's.\n\nShe studied us as though she were seeing for the first time beings of\nher own kind. She spoke--and her voice was elfin distant, chimingly\nsweet like hidden little golden bells; filled with that tranquil, far\noff spirit that was part of her--as though indeed a tiny golden chime\nshould ring out from the silences, speak for them, find tongues for\nthem. The words were hesitating, halting as though the lips that uttered\nthem found speech strange--as strange as the clear eyes found our\nimages.\n\nAnd the words were Persian--purest, most ancient Persian.\n\n\"I am Norhala,\" the golden voice chimed forth, whispered down into\nsilence. \"I am Norhala.\"\n\nShe shook her head impatiently. A hand stole forth from beneath her\nveils, slender, long-fingered with nails like rosy pearls; above the\nwrist was coiled a golden dragon with wicked little crimson eyes. The\nslender white hand touched Ruth's head, turned it until the strange,\nflecked orbs looked directly into the misty ones of blue.\n\nLong they gazed--and deep. Then she who had named herself Norhala thrust\nout a finger, touched the tear that hung upon Ruth's curled lashes,\nregarded it wonderingly.\n\nSomething of recognition, of memory, seemed to awaken within her.\n\n\"You are--troubled?\" she asked with that halting effort.\n\nRuth shook her head.\n\n\"THEY--do not trouble you?\"\n\nShe pointed to the huddled heaps strewing the hollow. And then I saw\nwhence the light which had streamed from her great eyes came. For the\nlittle azure and golden stars paled, trembled, then flashed out like\ngalaxies of tiny, clustered silver suns.\n\nFrom that weird radiance Ruth shrank, affrighted.\n\n\"No--no,\" she gasped. \"I weep for--HIM.\"\n\nShe pointed where Chiu-Ming lay, a brown blotch at the edge of the\nshattered men.\n\n\"For--him?\" There was puzzlement in the faint voice. \"For--that? But\nwhy?\"\n\nShe looked at Chiu-Ming--and I knew that to her the sight of the\ncrumpled form carried no recognition of the human, nothing of kin to\nher. There was a faint wonder in her eyes, no longer light-filled, when\nat last she turned back to us. Long she considered us.\n\n\"Now,\" she broke the silence, \"now something stirs within me that it\nseems has long been sleeping. It bids me take you with me. Come!\"\n\nAbruptly she turned from us, glided to the crevice. We looked at each\nother, seeking council, decision.\n\n\"Chiu-Ming,\" Drake spoke. \"We can't leave him like that. At least let's\ncover him from the vultures.\"\n\n\"Come.\" The woman had reached the mouth of the fissure.\n\n\"I'm afraid! Oh, Martin--I'm afraid.\" Ruth reached little trembling\nhands to her tall brother.\n\n\"Come!\" Norhala called again. There was an echo of harshness, a\nclanging, peremptory and inexorable, in the chiming.\n\nVentnor shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Come, then,\" he said.\n\nWith one last look at the Chinese, the lammergeiers already circling\nabout him, we walked to the crevice. Norhala waited, silent, brooding\nuntil we passed her; then glided behind us.\n\nBefore we had gone ten paces I saw that the place was no fissure. It\nwas a tunnel, a passage hewn by human hands, its walls covered with the\nwrithing dragon lines, its roof the mountain.\n\nThe swathed woman swept by us. Swiftly we followed her. Far, far ahead\nwas a wan gleaming. It quivered, a faintly shimmering, ghostly curtain,\na full mile away.\n\nNow it was close; we passed through it and were out of the tunnel.\nBefore us stretched a narrow gorge, a sword slash in the body of the\ntowering giant under whose feet the tunnel crept. High above was the\nribbon of the sky.\n\nThe sides were dark, but it came to me that here were no trees, no\nverdure of any kind. Its floor was strewn with boulders, fantastically\nshaped, almost indistinguishable in the fast closing dark.\n\nTwin monoliths bulwarked the passage end; the gigantic stones were\nleaning, crumbling. Fissures radiated from the opening, like deep\nwrinkles in the rock, showing where earth warping, range pressure, had\nlong been working to close this hewn way.\n\n\"Stop,\" Norhala's abrupt, golden note halted us; and again through the\nclear eyes I saw the white starshine flash.\n\n\"It may be well--\" She spoke as though to herself. \"It may be well to\nclose this way. It is not needed--\"\n\nHer voice rang out again, vibrant, strangely disquieting, harmonious.\nMurmurous chanting it was at first, rhythmic and low; ripples and\nflutings, tones and progressions utterly unknown to me; unfamiliar,\nabrupt, and alien themes that kept returning, droppings of crystal-clear\njewels of sound, golden tollings--and all ordered, mathematical,\nGEOMETRIC, even as had been the gestures of the shapes; Lilliputians of\nthe ruins, Brobdignagian of the haunted hollow.\n\nWhat was it? I had it--IT WAS THOSE GESTURES TRANSFORMED INTO SOUND!\n\nThere was a movement down by the tunnel mouth. It grew more rapid,\nseemed to vibrate with her song. Within the darkness there were\nlittle flashes; glimmerings of light began to come and go--like\nlittle awakenings of eyes of soft, jeweled flames, like giant gorgeous\nfireflies; flashes of cloudy amber, gleam of rose, sparkles of diamonds\nand of opals, of emeralds and of rubies--blinking, gleaming.\n\nA shimmering mist drew down around them--a swift and swirling mist.\nIt thickened, was shot with slender shuttled threads like cobweb,\ncoruscating strands of light.\n\nThe shining threads grew thicker, pulsed, were spangled with tiny vivid\nsparklings. They ran together, condensed--and all this in an instant, in\na tenth of the time it takes me to write it.\n\nFrom fiery mist and gemmed flashes came bolt upon bolt of lightning. The\ncliff face leaped out, a cataract of green flame. The fissures widened,\nthe monoliths trembled, fell.\n\nIn the wake of that dazzling brilliancy came utter blackness. I opened\nmy blinded eyes; slowly the flecks of green fire cleared. A faint\nlambency still clung to the cliff. By it I saw that the tunnel's mouth\nhad vanished, had been sealed--where it had gaped were only tons of\nshattered rock.\n\nCame a rushing past us as of great bodies; something grazed my hand,\nsomething whose touch was like that of warm metal--but metal throbbing\nwith life. They rushed by--and whispered down into silence.\n\n\"Come!\" Norhala flitted ahead of us, a faintly luminous shape in the\ndarkness. Swiftly we followed. I found Ruth beside me; felt her hand\ngrip my wrist.\n\n\"Walter,\" she whispered, \"Walter--she isn't human!\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I muttered. \"Nonsense, Ruth. What do you think she is--a\ngoddess, a spirit of the Himalayas? She's as human as you or I.\"\n\n\"No.\" Even in the darkness I could sense the stubborn shake of her curly\nhead. \"Not all human. Or how could she have commanded those things? Or\nhave summoned the lightnings that blasted the tunnel's mouth? And her\nskin and hair--they're too WONDERFUL, Walter.\n\n\"Why, she makes me look--look coarse. And the light that hovers about\nher--why, it is by that light we are making our way. And when she\ntouched me--I--I glowed--all through.\n\n\"Human, yes--but there is something else in her--something stronger than\nhumanness, something that--makes it sleep!\" she added astonishingly.\n\nThe ground was level as a dancing floor. We followed the enigmatic\nglow--emanation, it seemed to me--from Norhala which was as a light\nfor us to follow within the darkness. The high ribbon of sky had\nvanished--seemed to be overcast, for I could see no stars.\n\nWithin the darkness I began again to sense faint movement; soft stirring\nall about us. I had the feeling that on each side and behind us moved an\ninvisible host.\n\n\"There's something moving all about us--going with us,\" Ruth echoed my\nthought.\n\n\"It's the wind,\" I said, and paused--for there was no wind.\n\nFrom the blackness before us came a succession of curious, muffled\nclickings, like a smothered mitrailleuse. The luminescence that clothed\nNorhala brightened, deepening the darkness.\n\n\"Cross!\"\n\nShe pointed into the void ahead; then, as we started forward, thrust\nout a hand to Ruth, held her back. Drake and Ventnor drew close to them,\nquestioningly, anxious. But I stepped forward, out of the dim gleaming.\n\nBefore me were two cubes; one I judged in that uncertain light to be\nsix feet high, the other half its bulk. From them a shaft of pale-blue\nphosphorescence pierced the murk. They stood, the smaller pressed\nagainst the side of the larger, for all the world like a pair of immense\nnursery blocks, placed like steps by some giant child.\n\nAs my eyes swept over them, I saw that the shining shaft was an unbroken\nspan of cubes; not multi-arched like the Lilliputian bridge of the\ndragon chamber, but flat and running out over an abyss that gaped at\nmy very feet. All of a hundred feet they stretched; a slender, lustrous\ngirder crossing unguessed depths of gloom. From far, far below came the\nfaint whisper of rushing waters.\n\nI faltered. For these were the blocks that had formed the body of the\nmonster of the hollow, its flailing arms. The thing that had played so\nmurderously with the armored men.\n\nAnd now had shaped itself into this anchored, quiescent bridge.\n\n\"Do not fear.\" It was the woman speaking, softly, as one would reassure\na child. \"Ascend. Cross. They obey me.\"\n\nI stepped firmly upon the first block, climbed to the second. The\nspan stretched, sharp edged, smooth, only a slender, shimmering line\nrevealing where each great cube held fast to the other.\n\nI walked at first slowly, then with ever-increasing confidence, for up\nfrom the surface streamed a guiding, a holding force, that was like a\nhost of little invisible hands, steadying me, keeping firm my feet. I\nlooked down; the myriads of enigmatic eyes were staring, staring up\nat me from deep within. They fascinated me; I felt my pace slowing; a\nvertigo seized me. Resolutely I dragged my gaze up and ahead; marched\non.\n\nFrom the depths came more clearly the sound of the waters. Now there\nwere but a few feet more of the bridge before me. I reached its end,\ndropped my feet over, felt them touch a smaller cube, and descended.\n\nOver the span came Ventnor. He was leading his laden pony. He had\nbandaged its eyes so that it could not look upon the narrow way it was\ntreading. And close behind, a hand resting reassuringly upon its flank,\nstrode Drake, swinging along carelessly. The little beast ambled along\nserenely, sure-footed as all its mountain kind, and docile to darkness\nand guidance.\n\nThen, an arm about Ruth, floated Norhala. Now she was beside us; dropped\nher arm from Ruth; glided past us. On for a hundred yards or more we\nwent, and then she drew us a little toward the unseen canyon wall.\n\nShe stood before us, shielding us. One golden call she sent.\n\nI looked back into the darkness. Something like an enormous, dimly\nshimmering rod was raising itself. Higher it rose and higher. Now it\nstood, upright, a slender towering pillar, a gigantic slim figure whose\ntip pointed a full hundred feet in the air.\n\nThen slowly it inclined itself toward us; drew closer, closer to\nthe ground; touched and lay there for an instant inert. Abruptly it\nvanished.\n\nBut well I knew what I had seen. The span over which we had passed had\nraised itself even as had the baby bridge of the fortress; had lifted\nitself across the chasm and dropping itself upon the hither verge had\ndisintegrated into its units; was following us.\n\nA bridge of metal that could build itself--and break itself. A thinking,\nconscious metal bridge! A metal bridge with volition--with mind--that\nwas following us.\n\nThere sighed from behind a soft, sustained wailing; rapidly it neared\nus. A wanly glimmering shape drew by; halted. It was like a rigid\nserpent cut from a gigantic square bar of cold blue steel.\n\nIts head was a pyramid, a tetrahedron; its length vanished in the\nfurther darkness. The head raised itself, the blocks that formed its\nneck separating into open wedges like a Brobdignagian replica of those\njointed, fantastic, little painted reptiles the Japanese toy-makers cut\nfrom wood.\n\nIt seemed to regard us--mockingly. The pointed head dropped--past us\nstreamed the body. Upon it other pyramids clustered--like the spikes\nthat guarded the back of the nightmare Brontosaurus. Its end came\nswiftly into sight--its tail another pyramid twin to its head.\n\nIt FLIRTED by--gaily; vanished.\n\nI had thought the span must disintegrate to follow--and it did not\nneed to! It could move as a COMPOSITE as well as in UNITS. Move\nintelligently, consciously--as the Smiting Thing had moved.\n\n\"Come!\" Norhala's command checked my thoughts; we fell in behind her.\nLooking up I caught the friendly sparkle of a star; knew the cleft was\nwidening.\n\nThe star points grew thicker. We stepped out into a valley small as\nthat hollow from which we had fled; ringed like it with heaven-touching\nsummits. I could see clearly. The place was suffused with a soft\nradiance as though into it the far, bright stars were pouring all their\nrays, filling it as a cup with their pale flames.\n\nIt was luminous as the Alaskan valleys when on white arctic nights they\nare lighted, the Athabascans believe, by the gleaming spears of hunting\ngods. The walls of the valley seemed to be drawn back into infinite\ndistances.\n\nThe shimmering mists that had nimbused Norhala had vanished--or merging\ninto the wan gleaming had become one with it.\n\nI stared straight at her, striving to clarify in my own clouded thought\nwhat it was that I had sensed as inhuman--never of OUR world or its\npeoples. Yet this conviction came not because of the light that had\nhovered about her, nor of her summonings of the lightnings; nor even\nof her control of those--things--which had smitten the armored men and\nspanned for us the abyss.\n\nAll of that I was certain lay in the domain of the explicable, could be\nresolved into normality once the basic facts were gained.\n\nSuddenly, I knew. Side by side with what we term the human there dwelt\nwithin this woman an actual consciousness foreign to earth, passionless,\nat least as we know passion, ordered, mathematical--an emanation of the\neternal law which guides the circling stars.\n\nThis it was that had moved in the gestures which had evoked the\nlightnings. This it was that had spoken in the song which were those\ngestures transformed into sound. This it was that something greater than\nmy consciousness knew and accepted.\n\nSomething which shared, no--that reigned, serene and untroubled, upon\nthe throne of her mind; something utterly UNCOMPREHENDING, utterly\nunconscious OF, cosmically blind TO all human emotion; that spread\nitself like a veil over her own consciousness; that PLATED her\nthought--that was a strange word--why had it come to me--something that\nhad set its mark upon her like--like--the gigantic claw print on the\npoppied field, the little print of the dragoned hall.\n\nI caught at my mind, whirling I thought then in the grip of fantasy;\nstrove by taking minute note of her to bring myself back to normal.\n\nHer veils had slipped from her, baring her neck, her arms, the right\nshoulder. Under the smooth throat a buckle of dull gold held the sheer,\ndiaphanous folds of the pale amber silk which swathed the high and\nrounded breasts, hiding no goddess curve of them.\n\nA wide and golden girdle clasped the waist, covered the rounded hips\nand thighs. The long, narrow, and high-arched feet were shod with golden\nsandals, laced just below the rounded knees with flat turquoise studded\nbands.\n\nAnd shining through the amber folds, as glowing above them, the miracle\nof her body.\n\nThe dream of master sculptor given life. A goddess of earth's youth\nreborn in Himalayan wilds.\n\nShe raised her eyes; broke the long silence.\n\n\"Now being with you,\" she said dreamily, \"there waken within me old\nthoughts, old wisdom, old questioning--all that I had forgotten and\nthought forgotten forever--\"\n\nThe golden voice died--she who had spoken was gone from us, like the\nfading out of a phantom; like the breaking of a film.\n\nA flicker shot over the skies, another and another. A brilliant ray of\nintense green like that of a distant searchlight swept to the zenith,\nhung for a moment and withdrew. Up came pouring the lances and the\nstreamers of the aurora; faster and faster, banners and slender shining\nspears of green and iridescent blues and smoky, glistening reds.\n\nThe valley sprang into full view.\n\nI felt Ventnor's grip upon my wrist. I followed his pointing finger.\nInto the valley from the right ran a black spur of rock, half a mile\nfrom us, fifty feet high.\n\nUpon its crest stood--Norhala!\n\nHer arms were lifted to the sparkling sky; her braids were loosened--and\nas the fires of the aurora rose and fell, raced and were still, the\nsilken cloud of her tresses swirled and eddied with them. Little clouds\nof coruscations danced gaily like fireflies about and through it.\n\nAnd all her bared body was outlined in living light, glowed and throbbed\nwith light--light filled her like a vessel, she bathed in it. She thrust\narms through the streaming, flaming locks; held them out from her,\nprisoned. She swayed slowly, rhythmically; like a faint, golden chiming\ncame the echo of her song.\n\nAbruptly around her, half circling her on the black spur, gleamed\nmyriads of gem fires. Flares and flames of pale emerald, steady glowing\nof flame rubies, glints and lambencies of deepest sapphire, of wan\nsapphire, flickering opalescences, irised glitterings. A moment they\ngleamed. Then from them came bolt upon bolt of lightning--lightning that\ndarted upon the lovely shape swaying there; lightnings that fell upon\nher, broke and dashed, cascading, from her radiant body.\n\nThe lightnings bathed her--she bathed in them.\n\nThe skies were covered by a swift mist. The aurora was veiled.\n\nThe valley filled with a palely shimmering radiance which dropped like\nveils upon it, hiding all within it. Hiding within fold upon luminous\nfold--Norhala!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE SHAPES IN THE MIST\n\nMutely we faced each other, white and wan in the ghostly light.\n\nThe valley was very still; as silent as though sound had been withdrawn\nfrom it. The shimmering radiance suffusing it had thickened perceptibly;\nhovered over the valley floor faintly sparkling mists; hid it.\n\nLike a shroud was that silence. Beneath it my mind struggled, its\nunease, its forebodings growing ever stronger. Silently we repacked the\nsaddlebags; girthed the pony; silently we waited for Norhala's return.\n\nIdly I had noted that the place on which we stood must be raised\nabove the level of the vale. Up toward us the gathering mists had been\nsteadily rising; still was their wavering crest a half score feet below\nus.\n\nAbruptly out of their dim nebulosity a faintly phosphorescent square\nbroke. It lifted, slowly; then swept, a dully lustrous six-foot cube,\nup the slope and came to rest almost at our feet. It dwelt there;\ncontemplated us from its myriads of deep-set, sparkling striations.\n\nIn its wake swam, one by one, six others--their tops raising from\nthe vapors like the first, watchfully; like shimmering backs of\nsea monsters; like turrets of fantastic angled submarines from\nphosphorescent seas. One by one they skimmed swiftly over the ledge; and\none by one they nestled, edge to edge and alternately, against the cube\nwhich had gone before.\n\nIn a crescent, they stretched before us. Back from them, a pace, ten\npaces, twenty, we retreated.\n\nThey lay immobile--staring at us.\n\nCleaving the mists, silk of copper hair streaming wide, unearthly eyes\nlambent, floated up behind them--Norhala. For an instant she was hidden\nbehind their bulk; suddenly was upon them; drifted over them like some\nspirit of light; stood before us.\n\nHer veils were again about her; golden girdle, sandals of gold and\nturquoise in their places. Pearl white her body gleamed; no mark of\nlightning marred it.\n\nShe walked toward us, turned and faced the watching cubes. She uttered\nno sound, but as at a signal the central cube slid forward, halted\nbefore her. She rested a hand upon its edge.\n\n\"Ride with me,\" she said to Ruth.\n\n\"Norhala.\" Ventnor took a step forward. \"Norhala, we must go with her.\nAnd this\"--he pointed to the pony--\"must go with us.\"\n\n\"I meant--you--to come,\" the faraway voice chimed, \"but I had not\nthought of--that.\"\n\nA moment she considered; then turned to the six waiting cubes. Again as\nat a command four of the things moved, swirled in toward each other\nwith a weird precision, with a monstrous martial mimicry; joined; stood\nbefore us, a platform twelve feet square, six high.\n\n\"Mount,\" sighed Norhala.\n\nVentnor looked helplessly at the sheer front facing him.\n\n\"Mount.\" There was half-wondering impatience in her command. \"See!\"\n\nShe caught Ruth by the waist and with the same bewildering swiftness\nwith which she had vanished from us when the aurora beckoned she stood,\nholding the girl, upon the top of the single cube. It was as though the\ntwo had been lifted, had been levitated with an incredible rapidity.\n\n\"Mount,\" she murmured again, looking down upon us.\n\nSlowly Ventnor began to bandage the pony's eyes. I placed my hand upon\nthe edge of the quadruple; sprang. A myriad unseen hands caught me,\nraised me, set me instantaneously on the upward surface.\n\n\"Lift the pony to me,\" I called to Ventnor.\n\n\"Lift it?\" he echoed, incredulously.\n\nDrake's grin cut like a sunray through the nightmare dread that shrouded\nmy mind.\n\n\"Catch,\" he called; placed one hand beneath the beast's belly, the other\nunder its throat; his shoulders heaved--and up shot the pony, laden as\nit was, landed softly upon four wide-stretched legs beside me. The faces\nof the two gaped up, ludicrous in their amazement.\n\n\"Follow,\" cried Norhala.\n\nVentnor leaped wildly for the top, Drake beside him; in the flash of a\nhumming-bird's wing they were gripping me, swearing feebly. The unseen\nhold angled; struck upward; clutched from ankle to thigh; held us\nfast--men and beast.\n\nAway swept the block that bore Ruth and Norhala; I saw Ruth crouching,\nhead bent, her arms around the knees of the woman. They slipped into the\nmists; vanished.\n\nAnd after them, like a log in a racing current, we, too, dipped beneath\nthe faintly luminous vapors.\n\nThe cubes moved with an entire absence of vibration; so smoothly and\nskimmingly, indeed, that had it not been for the sudden wind that had\nrisen when first we had stirred, and that now beat steadily upon our\nfaces, and the cloudy walls streaming by, I would have thought ourselves\nat rest.\n\nI saw the blurred form of Ventnor drift toward the forward edge. He\nwalked as though wading. I essayed to follow him; my feet I could not\nlift; I could advance only by gliding them as though skating.\n\nAlso the force, whatever it was, that held me seemed to pass me on from\nunseen clutch to clutch; it was as though up to my hips I moved through\na closely woven yet fluid mass of cobwebs. I had the fantastic idea that\nif I so willed I could slip over the edge of the blocks, crawl about\ntheir sides without falling--like a fly on the vertical faces of a huge\nsugar loaf.\n\nI drew beside Ventnor. He was staring ahead, striving, I knew, to pierce\nthe mists for some glimpse of Ruth.\n\nHe turned to me, his face drawn with anxiety, his eyes feverish.\n\n\"Can you see them, Walter?\" His voice shook. \"God--why did I ever let\nher go like that? Why did I let her go alone?\"\n\n\"They'll be close ahead, Martin.\" I spoke out of a conviction I could\nnot explain. \"Whatever it is we're bound for, wherever it is the woman's\ntaking us, she means to keep us together--for a time at least. I'm sure\nof it.\"\n\n\"She said--follow.\" It was Drake beside us. \"How the hell can we do\nanything else? We haven't any control over this bird we're on. But she\nhas. What she meant, Ventnor, is that it would follow her.\"\n\n\"That's true\"--new hope softened the haggard face--\"that's true--but\nis it? We're reckoning with creatures that man's imagination never\nconceived--nor could conceive. And with this--woman--human in shape,\nyes, but human in thought--never. How then can we tell--\"\n\nHe turned once more, all his consciousness concentrated in his searching\neyes.\n\nDrake's rifle slipped from his hand.\n\nHe stooped to pick it up; then tugged with both hands. The rifle lay\nimmovable.\n\nI bent and strove to aid him. For all the pair of us could do, the rifle\nmight have been a part of the gleaming surface on which it rested. The\ntiny, deepset star points winked up--\n\n\"They're--laughing at us!\" grunted Drake.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I answered, and tried to check the involuntary shuddering\nthat shook me, as I saw it shake him. \"Nonsense. These blocks are great\nmagnets--that's what holds the rifle; what holds us, too.\"\n\n\"I don't mean the rifle,\" he said; \"I mean those points of lights--the\neyes--\"\n\nThere came from Ventnor a cry of almost anguished relief. We\nstraightened. Our head shot above the mists like those of swimmers from\nwater. Unnoticed, we had been climbing out of them.\n\nAnd a hundred yards ahead of us, cleaving them, veiled in them almost to\nthe shoulders, was Norhala, red-gold tresses steaming; and close beside\nher were the brown curls of Ruth. At her brother's cry she turned and\nher arm flashed out of the veils with reassuring gesture.\n\nA mile away was an opening in the valley's mountainous wall; toward it\nwe were speeding. It was no ragged crevice, no nature split fissure; it\ngave the impression of a gigantic doorway.\n\n\"Look,\" whispered Drake.\n\nBetween us and the vast gateway, gleaming triangles began to break\nthrough the vapors, like the cutting fins of sharks, glints of round\nbodies like gigantic porpoises--the vapors seethed with them. Quickly\nthe fins and rolling curves were all about us. They centered upon the\nportal, streamed through--a horde of the metal things, leading us,\nguarding us, playing about us.\n\nAnd weird, unutterably weird was that spectacle--the vast and silent\nvale with its still, smooth vapors like a coverlet of cloud; the regal\nhead of Norhala sweeping over them; the dull glint and gleam of the\nmetal paradoxes flowing, in ordered motion, all about us; the titanic\ngateway, glowing before us.\n\nWe were at its threshold; over it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE DRUMS OF THUNDER\n\nUpon that threshold the mists foamed like breaking billows, then ceased\nabruptly to be. Keeping exactly the distance I had noted when our gaze\nhad risen above the fog, glided the block that bore Ruth and Norhala.\nIn the strange light of the place into which we had emerged--and\nwhether that place was canyon, corridor, or tunnel I could not then\ndetermine--it stood out sharply.\n\nOne arm of Norhala held Ruth--and in her attitude I sensed a shielding\nintent, guardianship--the first really human impulse this shape of\nmystery and beauty had revealed.\n\nIn front of them swept score upon score of her familiars--no longer\ndully lustrous, but shining as though cut from blue and polished steel.\nThey--marched--in ordered rows, globes and cubes and pyramids; moving\nsedately now as units.\n\nI looked behind me; out of the spume boiling at the portal, were pouring\nforth other scores of the Metal Things, darting through like divers\nthrough a wave. And as they drew into our wake and swam into the light,\ntheir dim lustre vanished like a film; their surfaces grew almost\nradiant.\n\nWhence came the light that set them gleaming? Our pace had slackened--I\nlooked about me. The walls of the cleft or tunnel were perpendicular,\nsmooth and shining with a cold, metallic, greenish glow.\n\nBetween the walls, like rhythmic flashing of fire-flies, pulsed soft and\nfugitive glimmerings that carried a sense of the infinitely minute--of\nelectrons, it came to me, rather than atoms. Their irradiance was\ngreenish, like the walls; but I was certain that these corpuscles did\nnot come from them.\n\nThey blinked and faded like motes within a shifting sunbeam; or, to use\na more scientific comparison, like colloids within the illuminated field\nof the ultramicroscope; and like these latter it was as though the eyes\ntook in not the minute particles themselves but their movement only.\n\nSave for these gleamings the light of the place, although crepuscular,\nwas crystalline clear. High above us--five hundred, a thousand feet--the\nwalls merged into a haze of clouded beryl.\n\nRock certainly the cliffs were--but rock cut and planed, smoothed and\npolished and PLATED!\n\nYes, that was it--plated. Plated with some metallic substance that was\nitself a reservoir of luminosity and from which, it came to me, pulsed\nthe force that lighted the winking ions. But who could have done such a\nthing? For what purpose? How?\n\nAnd the meticulousness, the perfection of these smoothed cliffs struck\nover my nerves as no rasp could, stirring a vague resentment, an\nirritated desire for human inharmonies, human disorder.\n\nAbsorbed in my examination I had forgotten those who must share with me\nmy doubts and dangers. I felt a grip on my arm.\n\n\"If we get close enough and I can get my feet loose from this damned\nthing I'll jump,\" Drake said.\n\n\"What?\" I gasped, blankly, startled out of my preoccupation. \"Jump\nwhere?\"\n\nI followed his pointing finger. We were rapidly closing upon the other\ncube; it was now a scant twenty paces ahead; it seemed to be stopping.\nVentnor was leaning forward, quivering with eagerness.\n\n\"Ruth!\" he called. \"Ruth--are you all right?\"\n\nSlowly she turned to us--my heart gave a great leap, then seemed\nto stop. For her sweet face was touched with that same unearthly\ntranquillity which was Norhala's; in her brown eyes was a shadow of that\npassionless spirit brooding in Norhala's own; her voice as she answered\nheld within it more than echo of Norhala's faint, far-off golden\nchiming.\n\n\"Yes,\" she sighed; \"yes, Martin--have no fear for me--\"\n\nAnd turned from us, gazing forward once more with the woman and as\nsilent as she.\n\nI glanced covertly at Ventnor, at Drake--had I imagined, or had they\ntoo seen? Then I knew they had seen, for Ventnor's face was white to the\nlips, and Drake's jaw was set, his teeth clenched, his eyes blazing with\nanger.\n\n\"What's she doing to Ruth--you saw her face,\" he gritted, half\ninarticulately.\n\n\"Ruth!\" There was anguish in Ventnor's cry.\n\nShe did not turn again. It was as though she had not heard him.\n\nThe cubes were now not five yards apart. Drake gathered himself;\nstrained to loosen his feet from the shining surface, making ready to\nleap when they should draw close enough. His great chest swelled with\nhis effort, the muscles of his neck knotted, sweat steamed down his\nface.\n\n\"No use,\" he gasped, \"no use, Goodwin. It's like trying to lift yourself\nby your boot-straps--like a fly stuck in molasses.\"\n\n\"Ruth,\" cried Ventnor once more.\n\nAs though it had been a signal the block darted forward, resuming the\ndistance it had formerly maintained between us.\n\nThe vanguard of the Metal Things began to race. With an incredible speed\nthey fled into, were lost in an instant within, the luminous distances.\n\nThe cube that bore the woman and girl accelerated; flew faster and\nfaster onward. And as swiftly our own followed it. The lustrous walls\nflowed by, dizzily.\n\nWe had swept over toward the right wall of the cleft and were gliding\nover a broad ledge. This ledge was, I judged, all of a hundred feet in\nwidth. From it the floor of the place was dropping rapidly.\n\nThe opposite precipices were slowly drawing closer. After us flowed the\nflanking host.\n\nSteadily our ledge arose and the floor of the canyon dropped. Now we\nwere twenty feet above it, now thirty. And the character of the cliffs\nwas changing. Veins of quartz shone under the metallic plating like\ncut crystal, like cloudy opals; here was a splash of vermilion, there a\npatch of amber; bands of pallid ochre stained it.\n\nMy gaze was caught by a line of inky blackness in the exact center of\nthe falling floor. So black was it that at first glance I took it for a\nvein of jetty lignite.\n\nIt widened. It was a crack, a fissure. Now it was a yard in width, now\nthree, and blackness seemed to well up from within it, blackness that\nwas the very essence of the depths. Steadily the ebon rift expanded;\nspread suddenly wide open in two sharp-edged, flying wedges--\n\nEarth had dropped away. At our side a gulf had opened, an abyss,\nstriking down depth upon depth; profound; immeasurable.\n\nWe were human atoms, riding upon a steed of sorcery and racing along a\nsplit rampart of infinite space.\n\nI looked behind--scores of the cubes were darting from the metal host\ntrailing us; in a long column of twos they flashed by, raced ahead. Far\nin front of us a gloom began to grow; deepened until we were rushing\ninto blackest night.\n\nThrough the murk stabbed a long lance of pale blue phosphorescence.\nIt unrolled like a ribbon of wan flame, flicked like a serpent's\ntongue--held steady. I felt the Thing beneath us leap forward; its\nvelocity grew prodigious; the wind beat upon us with hurricane force.\n\nI shielded my eyes with my hands and peered through the chinks of my\nfingers. Ranged directly in our path was a barricade of the cubes and\nupon them we were racing like a flying battering-ram. Involuntarily I\nclosed my eyes against the annihilating impact that seemed inevitable.\n\nThe Thing on which we rode lifted.\n\nWe were soaring at a long angle straight to the top of the barrier; were\nupon it, and still with that awful speed unchecked were hurtling through\nthe blackness over the shaft of phosphorescence, the ribbon of pale\nlight that I had watched pierce it and knew now was but another span of\nthe cubes that but a little before had fled past us. Beneath the span,\non each side of it, I sensed illimitable void.\n\nWe were over; rushing along in darkness. There began a mighty tumult,\na vast crashing and roaring. The clangor waxed, beat about us with\ntremendous strokes of sound.\n\nFar away was a dim glowing, as of rising sun through heavy mists of\ndawn. The mists faded--miles away gleamed what at first glimpse seemed\nindeed to be the rising sun; a gigantic orb, whose lower limb just\ntouched, was sharply, horizontally cut by the blackness, as though at\nits base that blackness was frozen.\n\nThe sun? Reason returned to me; told me this globe could not be that.\n\nWhat was it then? Ra-Harmachis, of the Egyptians, stripped of his wings,\nexiled and growing old in the corridors of the Dead? Or that mocking\nluminary, the cold phantom of the God of light and warmth which the old\nNorsemen believed was set in their frozen hell to torment the damned?\n\nI thrust aside the fantasies, impatiently. But sun or no sun, light\nstreamed from this orb, light in multicolored, lanced rays, banishing\nthe blackness through which we had been flying.\n\nCloser we came and closer; lighter it grew about us, and by the growing\nlight I saw that still beside us ran the abyss. And even louder, more\nthunderous, became the clamor.\n\nAt the foot of the radiant disk I glimpsed a luminous pool. Into it, out\nof the depths, protruded a tremendous rectangular tongue, gleaming like\ngray steel.\n\nOn the tongue an inky shape appeared; it lifted itself from the abyss,\nrushed upon the disk and took form.\n\nLike a gigantic spider it was, squat and horned. For an instant it was\nsilhouetted against the smiling sphere, poised itself--and vanished\nthrough it.\n\nNow, not far ahead, silhouetted as had been the spider shape, blackened\ninto sight a cube and on it Ruth and Norhala. It seemed to hover, to\nwait.\n\n\"It's a door,\" Drake's shout beat thinly in my ears against the\nhurricane of sound.\n\nWhat I thought had been an orb was indeed a gateway, a portal; and it\nwas gigantic.\n\nThe light streamed through it, the flaming colors, the lightning glare,\nthe drifting shadows were all beyond it. The suggestion of sphere had\nbeen an illusion, born of the darkness in which we were moving and in\nits own luminescence.\n\nAnd I saw that the steel tongue was a ramp, a slide, dropping down into\nthe gulf.\n\nNorhala raised her hands high above her head. Up from the darkness flew\nan incredible shape--like a monstrous, armored flat-backed crab; angled\nspikes protruded from it; its huge body was spangled with darting,\ngreenish flames.\n\nIt swept beneath us and by. On its back were multitudinous breasts from\nwhich issued blinding flashes--sapphire blue, emerald green, sun yellow.\nIt hung poised as had that other nightmare shape, standing out jet black\nand colossal, rearing upon columnar legs, whose outlines were those of\nalternate enormous angled arrow-points and lunettes. Swiftly its form\nshifted; an instant it hovered, half disintegrate.\n\nNow I saw spinning spheres and darting cubes and pyramids click into new\npositions. The front and side legs lengthened, the back legs shortened,\nfitting themselves plainly to what must be a varying angle of descent\nbeyond.\n\nAnd it was no chimera, no kraken of the abyss. It was a car made of\nthe Metal Things. I caught again the flashes and thought that they were\njewels or heaps of shining ores carried by the conscious machine.\n\nIt vanished. In its place hung poised the cube that bore the enigmatic\nwoman and Ruth. Then they were gone and we stood where but an instant\nbefore they had been.\n\nWe were high above an ocean of living light--a sea of incandescent\nsplendors that stretched mile upon uncounted mile away and whose\nincredible waves streamed thousands of feet in air, flew in gigantic\nbanners, in tremendous streamers, in coruscating clouds of varicolored\nflame--as though torn by the talons of a mighty wind.\n\nMy dazzled sight cleared, glare and blaze and searing incandescence\ntook form, became ordered. Within the sea of light I glimpsed shapes\ncyclopean, unnameable.\n\nThey moved slowly, with an awesome deliberateness. They shone darkly\nwithin the flame-woven depths. From them came the volleys of the\nlightnings.\n\nScore upon score of them there were--huge and enigmatic. Their flaming\nlevins threaded the shimmering veils, patterned them, as though they\nwere the flying robes of the very spirit of fire.\n\nAnd the tumult was as ten thousand Thors, smiting with hammers against\nthe enemies of Odin. As a forge upon whose shouting anvils was being\nshaped a new world.\n\nA new world? A metal world!\n\nThe thought spun through my mazed brain, was gone--and not until\nlong after did I remember it. For suddenly all that clamor died; the\nlightnings ceased; all the flitting radiances paled and the sea of\nflaming splendors grew thin as moving mists. The storming shapes dulled\nwith them, seemed to darken into the murk.\n\nThrough the fast-waning light and far, far away--miles it seemed on high\nand many, many miles in length--a broad band of fluorescent amethyst\nshone. From it dropped curtains, shimmering, nebulous as the marching\nfolds of the aurora; they poured, cascaded, from the amethystine band.\n\nHuge and purple-black against their opalescence bulked what at first I\nthought a mountain, so like was it to one of those fantastic buttes of\nour desert Southwest when their castellated tops are silhouetted against\nthe setting sun; knew instantly that this was but subconscious striving\nto translate into terms of reality the incredible.\n\nIt was a City!\n\nA city full five thousand feet high and crowned with countless spires\nand turrets, titanic arches, stupendous domes! It was as though the\nman-made cliffs of lower New York were raised scores of times their\nheight, stretched a score of times their length. And weirdly enough it\ndid suggest those same towering masses of masonry when one sees them\nblacken against the twilight skies.\n\nThe pit darkened as though night were filtering down into it; the vast,\npurple-shadowed walls of the city sparkled out with countless lights.\nFrom the crowning arches and turrets leaped broad filaments of flame,\nflashing, electric.\n\nWas it my straining eyes, the play of the light and shadow--or were\nthose high-flung excrescences shifting, changing shape? An icy\nhand stretched out of the unknown, stilled my heart. For they\nwere shifting--arches and domes, turrets and spires; were melting,\nreappearing in ferment; like the lightning-threaded, rolling edges of\nthe thundercloud.\n\nI wrenched my gaze away; saw that our platform had come to rest upon a\nbroad and silvery ledge close to the curving frame of the portal and not\na yard from where upon her block stood Norhala, her arm clasped about\nthe rigid form of Ruth. I heard a sigh from Ventnor, an exclamation from\nDrake.\n\nBefore one of us could cry out to Ruth, the cube glided to the edge of\nthe shelf, dipped out of sight.\n\nThat upon which we rode trembled and sped after it.\n\nThere came a sickening sense of falling; we lurched against each other;\nfor the first time the pony whinnied, fearfully. Then with awful speed\nwe were flying down a wide, a glistening, a steeply angled ramp into the\nPit, straight toward the half-hidden, soaring escarpments flashing afar.\n\nFar ahead raced the Thing on which stood woman and maid. Their hair\nstreamed behind them, mingled, silken web of brown and shining veil\nof red-gold; little clouds of sparkling corpuscles threaded them, like\nflitting swarms of fire-flies; their bodies were nimbused with tiny,\nflickering tongues of lavender flame.\n\nAbout us, above us, began again to rumble the countless drums of the\nthunder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE PORTAL OF FLAME\n\nIt was as though we were on a meteor hurtling through space. The split\nair shrieked and shrilled, a keening barrier against the avalanche of\nthe thunder. The blast bent us far back on thighs held rigid by the\nmagnetic grip.\n\nThe pony spread its legs, dropped its head; through the hurricane\nroaring its screaming pierced thinly, that agonizing, terrible\nlamentation which is of the horse and the horse alone when the limit of\nits endurance is reached.\n\nVentnor crouched lower and lower, eyes shielded behind arms folded over\nhis brows, straining for a glimpse of Ruth; Drake crouched beside him,\nbracing him, supporting him against the tempest.\n\nOur line of flight became less abrupt, but the speed increased, the\nwind-pressure became almost insupportable. I twisted, dropped upon my\nright arm, thrust my head against my shoulder, stared backward. When\nfirst I had looked upon the place I had sensed its immensity; now I\nbegan to realize how vast it must really be--for already the gateway\nthrough which we had come glimmered far away on high, shrunk to a hoop\nof incandescent brass and dwindling fast.\n\nNor was it a cavern; I saw the stars, traced with deep relief the\nfamiliar Northern constellations. Pit it might be, but whatever terror,\nwhatever ordeals were before us, we would not have to face them buried\ndeep within earth. There was a curious comfort to me in the thought.\n\nSuddenly stars and sky were blotted out.\n\nWe had plunged beneath the surface of the radiant sea.\n\nLying in the position in which I was, I was sensible of a diminution\nof the cyclonic force; the blast streamed up and over the front of the\ncube. To me drifted only the wailings of our flight and the whimpering\nterror of the pony.\n\nI turned my head cautiously. Upon the very edge of the flying blocks\nsquatted Drake and Ventnor, grotesquely frog-like. I crawled toward\nthem--crawled, literally, like a caterpillar; for wherever my body\ntouched the surface of the cubes the attracting force held it, allowed a\ncreeping movement only, surface sliding upon surface--and weirdly enough\nlike a human measuring-worm I looped myself over to them.\n\nAs my bare palms clung to the Things I realized with finality that\nwhatever their activation, their life, they WERE metal.\n\nThere was no mistaking now the testimony of touch. Metal they were, with\na hint upon contact of highly polished platinum, or at the least of a\nmetal as finely grained as it.\n\nAlso they had temperature, a curiously pleasant warmth--the surfaces\nwere, I judged, around ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. I looked deep\ndown into the little sparkling points that were, I knew, organs of\nsight; they were like the points of contact of innumerable intersecting\ncrystal planes. They held strangest paradoxical suggestion of being\nclose to the surface and still infinite distances away.\n\nAnd they were like--what was it they were like?--it came to me with a\ndistinct shock.\n\nThey were like the galaxies of little aureate and sapphire stars in the\nclear gray heavens of Norhala's eyes.\n\nI crept beside Drake, struck him with my head.\n\n\"Can't move,\" I shouted. \"Can't lift my hands. Stuck fast--like a\nfly--just as you said.\"\n\n\"Drag 'em over your knees,\" he cried, bending to me. \"It slides 'em out\nof the attraction.\"\n\nActing as he had suggested I found to my astonishment I could slip my\nhands free; I caught his belt, tried to lift myself by it.\n\n\"No use, Doc.\" The old grin lightened for a moment his tense young face.\n\"You'll have to keep praying till the power's turned off. Nothing here\nyou can slide your knees on.\"\n\nI nodded, waddling close to his side; then sank back on my haunches to\nrelieve the strain upon my aching leg-muscles.\n\n\"Can you see them ahead, Walter--Ruth and the woman?\" Ventnor turned his\nanxious eyes toward me.\n\nI peered into the glimmering murk; shook my head. I could see nothing.\nIt was indeed, as though the clustered cubes sped within a bubble of the\nnow wanly glistening vapors; or rather as though in our passage--as a\nprojectile does in air--we piled before us a thick wave of the mists\nwhich streaming along each side, closing in behind, obscured all that\nlay around.\n\nYet I had, persistently, the feeling that beyond these shroudings was\nvast and ordered movement; marchings and counter-marchings of hosts\ngreater even than those Golden Hordes of Genghis which ages agone had\nwashed about the outer bases of the very peaks that hid this place.\nCame, too, flitting shadowings of huge shapes, unnameable, moving\nswiftly beside our way; gleamings that thrust themselves through the\nveils like wheeling javelins of flame.\n\nAnd always, always, everywhere that constant movement, rhythmic,\nterrifying--like myriads of feet of creatures of an unseen, stranger\nworld marking time just outside the threshold of our own. Preparing,\nDRILLING there in some wide vestibule of space between the known and the\nunknown, alert and menacing--poised for the signal which would send them\npouring over it.\n\n\nOnce again I seemed to stand upon the brink of an abyss of incredible\nrevelation, striving helplessly, struggling for realization--and so\nstruggling became aware that our speed was swiftly slackening, the\nroaring blast dying down, the veils before us thinning.\n\nThey cleared away. I saw Drake and Ventnor straighten up; raised myself\nto my own aching knees.\n\nWe were at one end of a vortex, a funneling within the radiant vapors; a\nfunnel whose further end a mile ahead broadened out into a huge\ncircle, its mistily outlined edges impinging upon the towering scarp\nof the--city. It was as though before us lay, upon its side, a cone of\ncrystalline clear air against whose curved sides some radiant medium\nheavier than air, lighter than water, pressed.\n\nThe top arc of its prostrate base reached a thousand feet or more up the\nprecipitous wall; above it all was hidden in sparkling nebulosities that\nwere like still clouds of greenly glimmering fire-flies. Back from\nthe curving sides of this cone, above it and below it, the pressing\nluminosities stretched into, it seemed, infinite distances.\n\nThrough them, suddenly, thousands of bright beams began to dart, to\ndance, weaving and interweaving, shooting hither and yon--like myriads\nof great searchlights in a phosphorescent sea fog, like countless lances\nof the aurora thrusting through its own iridescent veils! And in the\nplay of these beams was something appallingly ordered, appallingly\nrhythmic.\n\nIt was--how can I describe it?--PURPOSEFUL; purposeful as the geometric\nshiftings of the Little Things of the ruins, of the summoning song of\nNorhala, of the Protean changes of the Smiting Shape and the Following\nThing; and like all of these it was as laden with that baffling\ncertainty of hidden meanings, of messages that the brain recognized as\nsuch yet knew it never could read.\n\nThe rays seemed to spring upward from the earth. Now they were like\ncountless lances of light borne by marching armies of Titans; now they\ncrossed and angled and flew as though they were clouds of javelins\nhurled by battling swarms of the Genii of Light. And now they stood\nupright while through them, thrusting them aside, bending them, passed\nvast, vague shapes like mountains forming and dissolving; like darkening\nmonsters of some world of light pushing through thick forests of\nslender, high-reaching trees of cold flame; shifting shadows of\nmonstrous chimerae slipping through jungles of bamboo with trunks of\ndiamond fire; phantasmal leviathans swimming through brakes of giant\nreeds of radiance rising from the sparking ooze of a sea of star shine.\n\nWhence came the force, the mechanism that produced this cone of clarity,\nthis NOT searchlight, but unlight in the midst of light? Not from\nbehind, that was certain--for turning I saw that behind us the mist was\nas thick. I turned again--it came to me, why I knew not, yet with an\nabsolute certainty, that the energy, the force emanated from the distant\nwall itself.\n\nThe funnel, the cone, did not expand from where we were standing, now\nmotionless.\n\nIt began at the wall and focused upon us.\n\nWithin the great circle the surface of the wall was smooth, utterly\nblank; upon it was no trace of those flitting lights we had seen before\nwe had plunged down toward the radiant sea. It shone with a pale blue\nphosphorescence. It was featureless, smooth, a blind cliff of polished,\nblue metal--and that was all.\n\n\"Ruth!\" groaned Ventnor. \"Where is she?\"\n\nAghast at my mental withdrawal from him, angry at myself for my\ncallousness, awkwardly I tried to crawl over to him, to touch him,\ncomfort him as well as I might.\n\nAnd then, as though his cry had been a signal, the great cone began to\nmove. Slowly the circled base slipped down the shimmering facades; down,\nsteadily down; I realized that we had paused at the edge of some steep\ndeclivity, for the bottom of the cone was now at a decided angle while\nthe upper edge of the circle had dropped a full two hundred feet below\nthe place where it had rested--and still it fell.\n\n\nThere came a gasp of relief from Ventnor, a sigh from Drake while, from\nmy own heart, a weight rolled. Not ten yards ahead of us and still deep\nwithin the luminosity had appeared the regal head of Norhala, the lovely\nhead of Ruth. The two rose out of the glow like swimmers floating from\nthe depths. Now they were clear before us, and now we could see the\nsurface of the cube on which they rode.\n\nBut neither turned to us; each stared straightly, motionless along the\naxis of the sinking cone, the woman's left arm holding Ruth close to her\nside.\n\nDrake's hand caught my shoulder in a grip that hurt--nor did he need to\npoint toward that which had wrung the exclamation from him. The funnel\nhad broken from its slow falling; it had made one swift, startling\ndrop and had come to rest. Its recumbent side was now flattened into a\ntriangular plane, widening from the narrow tip in which we stood to all\nof five hundred feet where its base rested against the blue wall, and\nfalling at a full thirty-degree pitch.\n\nThe misty-edged circle had become an oval, a flattened ellipse another\nfive hundred feet high and three times that in length. And in its exact\ncenter, shining forth as though it opened into a place of pale azure\nincandescence was another rectangular Cyclopean portal.\n\nOn each side of it, in the apparently solid face of the gleaming,\nmetallic cliffs, a slit was opening.\n\nThey began as thin lines a hundred yards in height through which\nthe intense light seemed to hiss; quickly they opened--widening like\nmonstrous cat pupils until at last, their widening ceasing, they glared\nforth, the blue incandescence gushing from them like molten steel from\nan opened sluice.\n\nDeep within them I sensed a movement. Scores of towering shapes swam\nwithin and glided out of them, each reflecting the vivid light as though\nthey themselves were incandescent. Around their crests spun wide and\nflaming coronets.\n\nThey rushed forth, wheeling, whirling, driven like leaves in a\nwhirlwind. Out they swirled from the cat's eyes of the glimmering wall,\nthese dervish obelisks crowded with spinning fires. They vanished in the\nmists. Instantly with their going, the eyes contracted; were but slits;\nwere gone. And before us within the oval was only the waiting portal.\n\nThe leading block leaped forward. As abruptly, those that bore us\nfollowed. Again under that strain of projectile flight we clutched each\nother; the pony screamed in terror. The metal cliff rushed to meet us\nlike a thunder cloud of steel; the portal raced upon us--a square mouth\nof cold blue flame.\n\nAnd into it we swept; were devoured by it.\n\nLight in blinding, intolerable flood beat about us, blackening the sight\nwith agony. We pressed, the three of us, against the side of the pony,\nburying our faces in its shaggy coat, striving to hide our eyes from the\nradiance which, strain closely as we might, seemed to pierce through the\nbody of the little beast, through our own heads, searing the sight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. \"WITCH! GIVE BACK MY SISTER\"\n\nHow long we were within that glare I do not know; it seemed unending\nhours; it was of course only minutes--seconds, perhaps. Then I was\nsensible of a permeating shadow, a darkness gentle and healing.\n\nI raised my head and opened my eyes. We were moving tranquilly, with\na curious suggestion of homing leisureliness, through a soft, blue\nshimmering darkness. It was as though we were drifting within some high\nborderland of light; a region in which that rapid vibration we call the\nviolet was mingled with a still more rapid vibration whose quick pulsing\nwas felt by the brain but ever fled ere that brain could register it in\nterms of color. And there seemed to be a film over my sight; dazzlement\nfrom the unearthly blaze, I thought, shaking my head impatiently.\n\nMy eyes focused upon an object a little more than a foot away; my neck\ngrew rigid, my scalp prickled while I stared, unbelieving. And that at\nwhich I stared was--a skeleton hand. Every bone a grayish black, sharply\nsilhouetted, clean as some master surgeon's specimen, it was extended\nas though clutching at--clutching at--what was that toward which it was\nreaching?\n\nAgain the icy prickling over scalp and skin--for its talons stretched\nout to grasp a steed that Death himself might have ridden, a rack whose\nbare skull hung drooping upon bent vertebrae.\n\nI raised my hands to my face to shut out the ghostly sight--and swiftly\nthe clutching bony hand moved toward me--was before my eyes--touched me.\n\nThe cry that sheer horror wrested from me was strangled by realization.\nAnd so acute was my relief, so reassuring was it to have in the midst\nof these mysteries some sane, understandable thing occur that I laughed\naloud.\n\nFor the skeleton hand was my own. The mournful ghastly mount of death\nwas--our pony. And when I looked again I knew what I would see--and\nsee them I did--two tall skeletons, skulls resting on their bony arms,\nleaning against the frame of the beast.\n\nWhile ahead of us, floating poised upon the surface of the glistening\ncube, were two women skeletons--Ruth and Norhala!\n\nWeird enough was the sight. Dureresque, grimly awful as materialization\nof a scene of the Dance Macabre--and yet--vastly comforting.\n\nFor here was something which was well within the range of human\nknowledge. It was the light about us that did it; a vibration that even\nas I conjectured, was within the only partly explored region of the\nultraviolet and the comparatively unexplored region above it.\n\nYet there were differences, for there was none of that misty halo around\nthe bones, the flesh which the X-rays cannot render wholly invisible.\nThe skeletons stood out clean cut, with no trace of fleshly vestments.\n\nI crept over, spoke to the two.\n\n\"Don't look up yet,\" I said. \"Don't open your eyes. We're going through\na queer light. It has an X-ray quality. You're going to see me as a\nskeleton--\"\n\n\"What?\" shouted Drake. Disobeying my warning he straightened, glared\nat me. And disquieting as the spectacle had been before, fully\nunderstanding it as I did, I could not restrain my shudder at the utter\nweirdness of that skull which was his head thrusting itself toward me.\n\nThe skeleton that was Ventnor turned to me; was arrested by the sight of\nthe flitting pair ahead. I saw the fleshless jaws clamp, then opened to\nspeak.\n\nAbruptly, upon the skeletons in front the flesh dropped back. Girl and\nwoman stood there once again robed in beauty.\n\nSo swift was that transition from the grisly unreal to the normal that\neven to my unsuperstitious mind it smacked of necromancy. The next\ninstant the three of us stood looking at each other, clothed once more\nin the flesh, and the pony no longer the steed of death, but our shaggy,\npatient little companion.\n\nThe light had changed; the high violet had gone from it, and it was shot\nwith yellow gleamings like fugitive sunbeams. We were passing through\na wide corridor that seemed to be unending. The yellow light grew\nstronger.\n\n\"That light wasn't exactly the Roentgen variety,\" Drake interrupted my\nabsorption in our surroundings. \"And I hope to God it's as different as\nit seemed. If it's not we may be up against a lot of trouble.\"\n\n\"More trouble than we're in?\" I asked, a trifle satirically.\n\n\"X-ray burns,\" he answered, \"and no way to treat them in this place--if\nwe live to want treatment,\" he ended grimly.\n\n\"I don't think we were subjected to their action long enough--\" I began,\nand was silent.\n\nThe corridor had opened without warning into a place for whose immensity\nI have no images that are adequate. It was a chamber that was vaster\nthan ten score of the Great Halls of Karnac in one; great as that fabled\nhall in dread Amenti where Osiris sits throned between the Searcher of\nHearts and the Eater of Souls, judging the jostling hosts of the newly\ndead.\n\nTemple it was in its immensity, and its solemn vastness--but unlike any\ntemple ever raised by human toil. In no ruin of earth's youth giants'\nwork now crumbling under the weight of time had I ever sensed a\nshadow of the strangeness with which this was instinct. No--nor in the\nshattered fanes that once had held the gods of old Egypt, nor in the\npillared shrines of Ancient Greece, nor Imperial Rome, nor mosque,\nbasilica nor cathedral.\n\nAll these had been dedicated to gods which, whether created by humanity\nas science believes, or creators of humanity as their worshippers\nbelieved, still held in them that essence we term human.\n\nThe spirit, the force, that filled this place had in it nothing, NOTHING\nof the human.\n\nNo place? Yes, there was one--Stonehenge. Within that monolithic circle\nI had felt a something akin to this, as inhuman; a brooding spirit\nstony, stark, unyielding--as though not men but a people of stone had\nraised the great Menhirs.\n\nThis was a sanctuary built by a people of metal!\n\nIt was filled with a soft yellow glow like pale sunshine. Up from its\nfloor arose hundreds of tremendous, square pillars down whose polished\nsides the crocus light seemed to flow.\n\nFar, far as the gaze could reach, the columns marched, oppressively\nordered, appallingly mathematical. From their massiveness distilled a\nsense of power, mysterious, mechanical yet--living; something priestly,\nhierophantic--as though they were guardians of a shrine.\n\nNow I saw whence came the light suffusing this place. High up among the\npillars floated scores of orbs that shone like pale gilt frozen suns.\nGreat and small, through all the upper levels these strange luminaries\ngleamed, fixed and motionless, hanging unsupported in space. Out from\ntheir shining spherical surfaces darted rays of the same pale gold,\nrigid, unshifting, with the same suggestion of frozen stillness.\n\n\"They look like big Christmas-tree stars,\" muttered Drake.\n\n\"They're lights,\" I answered. \"Of course they are. They're not\nmatter--not metal, I mean--\"\n\n\"There's something about them like St. Elmo's fire, witch\nlights--condensations of atmospheric electricity,\" Ventnor's voice was\ncalm; now that it was plain we were nearing the heart of this mystery\nin which we were enmeshed he had clearly taken fresh grip, was again his\nobservant, scientific self.\n\nWe watched, once more silent; and indeed we had spoken little since\nwe had begun that ride whose end we sensed close. In the unfolding of\nenigmatic happening after happening the mind had deserted speech and\ncrouched listening at every door of sight and hearing to gather some\nclue to causes, some thread of understanding.\n\nSlowly now we were gliding through the forest of pillars; so effortless,\nso smooth our flight that we seemed to be standing still, the tremendous\ncolumns flitting past us, turning and wheeling around us, dizzyingly. My\nhead swam with the mirage motion, I closed my eyes.\n\n\"Look,\" Drake was shaking me. \"Look. What do you make of that?\"\n\nHalf a mile ahead the pillars stopped at the edge of a shimmering,\nquivering curtain of green luminescence. High, high up past the pale\ngilt suns its smooth folds ran, into the golden amber mist that canopied\nthe columns.\n\nIn its sparkling was more than a hint of the dancing corpuscles of the\naurora; it was, indeed, as though woven of the auroral rays. And all\nabout it played shifting, tremulous shadows formed by the merging of the\ngolden light with the curtain's emerald gleaming.\n\nUp to its base swept the cube that bore Ruth and Norhala--and stopped.\nFrom it leaped the woman, and drew Ruth down beside her, then turned and\ngestured toward us.\n\nThat upon which we rode drew close. I felt it quiver beneath me; felt on\nthe instant, the magnetic grip drop from me, angle downward and leave me\nfree. Shakily I arose from aching knees, and saw Ventnor flash down and\nrun, rifle in hand, toward his sister.\n\nDrake bent for his gun. I moved unsteadily toward the side of the\nclustered cubes. There came a curious pushing motion driving me to the\nedge. Sliding over upon me came Drake and the pony--\n\nThe cube tilted, gently, playfully--and with the slightest of jars the\nthree of us stood beside it on the floor, we two men gaping at it in\nrenewed wonder, and the little beast stretching its legs, lifting its\nfeet and whinnying with relief.\n\nThen abruptly the four blocks that had been our steed broke from each\nother; that which had been the woman's glided to them.\n\nThe four clicked into place behind it and darted from sight.\n\n\"Ruth!\" Ventnor's voice was vibrant with his fear. \"Ruth! What is wrong\nwith you? What has she done to you?\"\n\nWe ran to his side. He stood clutching her hands, searching her eyes.\nThey were wide, unseeing, dream filled. Upon her face the calm and\nstillness, which were mirrored reflections of Norhala's unearthly\ntranquillity, had deepened.\n\n\"Brother.\" The sweet voice seemed far away, drifting out of untroubled\nspace, an echo of Norhala's golden chimings--\"Brother, there is nothing\nwrong with me. Indeed--all is--well with me--brother.\"\n\nHe dropped the listless palms, faced the woman, tall figure tense, drawn\nwith mingled rage and anguish.\n\n\"What have you done to her?\" he whispered in Norhala's own tongue.\n\nHer serene gaze took him in, undisturbed by his anger save for the\nfaintest shadow of wonder, of perplexity.\n\n\"Done?\" she repeated, slowly. \"I have stilled all that was troubled\nwithin her--have lifted her above sorrow. I have given her the peace--as\nI will give it to you if--\"\n\n\"You'll give me nothing,\" he interrupted fiercely; then, his passion\nbreaking through all restraint--\"Yes, you damned witch--you'll give me\nback my sister!\"\n\nIn his rage he had spoken English; she could not, of course, have\nunderstood the words, but their anger and hatred she did understand.\nHer serenity quivered, broke. The strange stars within her eyes began\nto glitter forth as they had when she had summoned the Smiting Thing.\nUnheeding, Ventnor thrust out a hand, caught her roughly by one bare,\nlovely shoulder.\n\n\"Give her back to me, I say!\" he cried. \"Give her back to me!\"\n\nThe woman's eyes grew--awful. Out of the distended pupils the strange\nstars blazed; upon her face was something of the goddess outraged. I\nfelt the shadow of Death's wings.\n\n\"No! No--Norhala! No, Martin!\" the veils of inhuman calm shrouding Ruth\nwere torn; swiftly the girl we knew looked out from them. She threw\nherself between the two, arms outstretched.\n\n\"Ventnor!\" Drake caught his arms, held them tight; \"that's not the way\nto save her!\"\n\nVentnor stood between us, quivering, half sobbing. Never until then had\nI realized how great, how absorbing was that love of his for Ruth. And\nthe woman saw it, too, even though dimly; envisioned it humanly. For,\nunder the shock of human passion, that which I thought then as utterly\nunknown to her as her cold serenity was to us, the sleeping soul--I\nuse the popular word for those emotional complexes that are peculiar to\nmankind--stirred, awakened.\n\nWrath fled from her knitted brows; her eyes dropping to the girl, lost\ntheir dreadfulness; softened. She turned them upon Ventnor, they brooded\nupon him; within their depths a half-troubled interest, a questioning.\n\nA smile dawned upon the exquisite face, humanizing it, transfiguring\nit, touching with tenderness the sweet and sleeping mouth--as a hovering\ndream the lips of the slumbering maid.\n\nAnd on the face of Ruth, as upon a mirror, I watched that same slow,\nunderstanding tenderness reflected!\n\n\"Come,\" said Norhala, and led the way through the sparkling curtains.\nAs she passed, an arm around Ruth's neck, I saw the marks of Ventnor's\nfingers upon her white shoulder, staining its purity, marring it like a\nblasphemy.\n\nFor an instant I hung behind, watching their figures grow misty within\nthe shining shadows; then followed hastily. Entering the mists I was\nconscious of a pleasant tingling, an acceleration of the pulse, an\nincrease of that sense of well-being which, I grew suddenly aware,\nhad since the beginning of our strange journey minimized the nervous\nattrition of constant contact with the abnormal.\n\nStriving to classify, to reduce to order, my sensations I drew close to\nthe others, overtaking them in a dozen paces. A dozen paces more and we\nstepped out of the curtainings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE METAL EMPEROR\n\nWe stood at the edge of a well whose walls were of that same green\nvaporous iridescence through which we had just come, but finer grained,\ncompact; as though here the corpuscles of which they were woven were far\ncloser spun. Thousands of feet above us the mighty cylinder uprose, and\nin the lessened circle that was its mouth I glimpsed the bright stars;\nand knew by this it opened into the free air.\n\nAll of half a mile in diameter was this shaft, and ringed regularly\nalong its height by wide amethystine bands--like rings of a hollow\npiston. They were, in color, replicas of that I had glimpsed before\nour descent into this place and against whose gleaming cataracts the\noutlines of the incredible city had lowered. And they were in motion,\nspinning smoothly, and swiftly.\n\nOnly one swift glance I gave them, my eyes held by a most\nextraordinary--edifice--altar--machine--I could not find the word for\nit--then.\n\nIts base was a scant hundred yards from where we had paused and\nconcentric with the sides of the pit. It stood upon a thick circular\npedestal of what appeared to be cloudy rock crystal supported by\nhundreds of thick rods of the same material.\n\nUp from it lifted the structure, a thing of glistening cones and\nspinning golden disks; fantastic yet disquietingly symmetrical; bizarre\nas an angled headdress worn by a mountainous Javanese god--yet coldly,\npainfully mathematical. In every direction the cones pointed, seemingly\ninterwoven of strands of metal and of light.\n\nWhat was their color? It came to me--that of the mysterious element\nwhich stains the sun's corona, that diadem seen only when our day star\nis in eclipse; the unknown element which science has named coronium,\nwhich never yet has been found on earth and that may be electricity\nin its one material form; electricity that is ponderable; force whose\nvibrations are keyed down to mass; power transmuted into substance.\n\nThousands upon thousands the cones bristled, pyramiding to the base\nof one tremendous spire that tapered up almost to the top of the shaft\nitself.\n\nIn their grouping the mind caught infinite calculations carried into\ninfinity; an apotheosis of geometry compassing the rhythms of unknown\nspatial dimensions; concentration of the equations of the star hordes.\n\nThe mathematics of the Cosmos.\n\nFrom the left of the crystalline base swept an enormous sphere. It was\ntwice the height of a tall man, and it was a paler blue than any of\nthese Things I had seen, almost, indeed, an azure; different, too, in\nother subtle, indefinable ways.\n\nBehind it glided a pair of the pyramidal shapes, their pointed\ntips higher by a yard or more than the top of the sphere. They\npaused--regarding us. Out from the opposite arc of the crystal pedestal\nmoved six other globes, somewhat smaller than the first and of a deep\npurplish luster.\n\nThey separated, lining up on each side of the leader now standing a\nlittle in advance of the twin tetrahedrons, rigid and motionless as\nwatching guards.\n\nThere they stood--that enigmatic row, intent, studying us beneath their\ngod or altar or machine of cones and disks within their cylinder walled\nwith light.\n\nAnd at that moment there crystallized within my consciousness the\nsublimation of all the strangenesses of all that had gone before, a\npanic loneliness as though I had wandered into an alien world--a world\nas unfamiliar to humanity, as unfamiliar with it as our own would seem\nto a thinking, mobile crystal adrift among men.\n\nNorhala raised her white arms in salutation; from her throat came a\nlilting theme of her weirdly ordered, golden chanting. Was it speech, I\nwondered; and if so--prayer or entreaty or command?\n\nThe great sphere quivered and undulated. Swifter than the eye could\nfollow it dilated; opened!\n\nWhere the azure globe had been, flashed out a disk of flaming splendors,\nthe very secret soul of flowered flame! And simultaneously the pyramids\nleaped up and out behind it--two gigantic, four-rayed stars blazing with\ncold blue fires.\n\nThe green auroral curtainings flared out, ran with streaming\nradiance--as though some Spirit of Jewels had broken bonds of\nenchantment and burst forth jubilant, flooding the shaft with its freed\nglories. Norhala's song ceased; an arm dropped down upon the shoulders\nof Ruth.\n\nThen woman and girl began to float toward the radiant disk.\n\nAs one, the three of us sprang after them. I felt a shock that was like\na quick, abrupt tap upon every nerve and muscle, stiffening them into\nhelpless rigidity.\n\nParalyzing that sharp, unseen contact had been, but nothing of pain\nfollowed it. Instead it created an extraordinary acuteness of sight and\nhearing, an abnormal keying up of the observational faculties, as though\nthe energy so mysteriously drawn from our motor centers had been thrown\nback into the sensory.\n\nI could take in every minute detail of the flashing miracle of gemmed\nfires and its flaming ministers. Halfway between them and us Norhala and\nRuth drifted; I could catch no hint of voluntary motion on their part\nand knew that they were not walking, but were being borne onward by some\nmanifestation of that same force which held us motionless.\n\nI forgot them in my contemplation of the Disk.\n\nIt was oval, twenty feet in height, I judged, and twelve in its greatest\nwidth. A broad band, translucent as sun golden chrysolite, ran about its\nperiphery.\n\nSet within this zodiac and spaced at mathematically regular intervals\nwere nine ovoids of intensely living light. They shone like nine\ngigantic cabochon cut sapphires; they ranged from palest, watery blue\nup through azure and purple and down to a ghostly mauve shot with sullen\nundertones of crimson.\n\nIn each of them was throned a flame that seemed the very fiery essence\nof vitality.\n\nThe--BODY--was convex, swelling outward like the boss of a shield;\nshimmering rosy-gray and crystalline. From the vital ovoids ran a\npattern of sparkling threads, irised and brilliant as floss of molten\njewels; converging with interfacings of spirals, of volutes and of\ntriangles into the nucleus.\n\nAnd that nucleus, what was it?\n\nEven now I can but guess--brain in part as we understand brain,\ncertainly; but far, far more than that in its energies, its powers.\n\nIt was like an immense rose. An incredible rose of a thousand close\nclustering petals. It blossomed with a myriad shifting hues. And instant\nby instant the flood of varicolored flame that poured into its petalings\ndown from the sapphire ovoids waxed and waned in crescendoes and\ndiminuendoes of relucent harmonies--ecstatic, awesome.\n\nThe heart of the rose was a star of incandescent ruby.\n\nFrom the flaming crimson center to aureate, flashing penumbra it was\ninstinct with and poured forth power--power vast and conscious.\n\nNot with that same completeness could I realize the ministering star\nshapes, half hidden as they were by the Disk. Their radiance was less,\nnor had they its miracle of pulsing gem fires. Blue they were, blue of\na peculiar vibrancy, and blue were the glistening threads that ran\ndown from blue-black circular convexities set within each of the points\nvisible to me.\n\nUnlike in shape, their flame of vitality dimmer than the ovoids of the\nDisk's golden zone, still I knew that they were even as those--ORGANS,\norgans of unknown senses, unknown potentialities. Their nuclei I could\nnot observe.\n\nThe floating figures had drawn close to that disk and had paused.\n\nAnd on the moment of their pausing I felt a surge of strength, a\nsnapping of the spell that had bound us, an instantaneous withdrawal of\nthe inhibiting force. Ventnor broke into a run, holding his rifle at\nthe alert. We raced after him; were close to the shining shapes. And,\ngasping, we stopped short not a dozen paces away.\n\nFor Norhala had soared up toward the flaming rose of the Disk as though\nlifted by gentle, unseen hands. Close to it for an instant she swung. I\nsaw the exquisite body gleam through her thin robes as though bathed in\nsoft flames of rosy pearl.\n\nHigher she floated, and toward the right of the zodiac. From the edges\nof three of the ovoids swirled a little cloud of tentacles, gossamer\nfilaments of opal. They whipped out a full yard from the Disk's surface,\ntouching her, caressing her.\n\nFor a moment she hung there, her face hidden from us; then was dropped\nsoftly to her feet and stood, arms stretched wide, her copper hair\nstreaming cloudily about her regal head.\n\nAnd up past her floated Ruth, levitated as had been she--and her face,\necstatic as though she were gazing into Paradise, yet drenched with the\ntranquillity of the infinite. Her wide eyes stared up toward that rose\nof splendors through which the pulsing colors now raced more swiftly.\nShe hung poised before it while around her head a faint aureole began to\nform.\n\nAgain the gossamer threads thrust forth, searched her. They ran over her\nrough clothing--perplexedly. They coiled about her neck, stole through\nher hair, brushed shut her eyes, circled her brow, her breasts, girdled\nher.\n\nWeirdly was it like some intelligence observing, studying, some creature\nof another species--puzzled by its similarity and unsimilarity with the\none other creature of its kind it knew, and striving to reconcile those\ndifferences. And like such a questioning brain calling upon others for\ncounsel, it swung Ruth upward to the watching star at the right.\n\nA rifle shot rang out.\n\nAnother--the reports breaking the silence like a profanation. Unseen by\neither of us, Ventnor had slipped to one side where he could cover the\ncore of ruby flame that must have seemed to him the heart of the Disk's\nrose of fire. He knelt a few yards away, white lipped, eyes cold gray\nice, sighting carefully for a third shot.\n\n\"Don't! Martin--don't fire!\" I shouted, leaping toward him.\n\n\"Stop! Ventnor--\" Drake's panic cry mingled with my own.\n\nBut before we could reach him, Norhala flew to him, like a darting\nswallow. Down the face of the Disk glided the upright body of Ruth,\nstruck softly, stood swaying.\n\nAnd out of the blue-black convexity within a star point of one of the\nopened pyramids a lance of intense green flame darted, a lightning bolt\nas real as any hurled by tempest, upon Ventnor.\n\nThe shattered air closed behind the streaming spark with the sound of\nbreaking glass.\n\nIt struck--Norhala.\n\nIt struck her. It seemed to splash upon her, to run down her like water.\nOne curling tongue writhed over her bare shoulder and leaped to the\nbarrel of the rifle in Ventnor's hands. It flashed up it and licked\nhim. The gun was torn from his grip, hurled high in air, exploding as it\nwent. He leaped convulsively from his knees and dropped.\n\nI heard a wailing, low, bitter and heartbroken. Past us ran Ruth, all\ndream, all unearthliness gone from a face now a tragic mask of human\nwoe and terror. She threw herself down beside her brother, felt of his\nheart; then raised herself upon her knees and thrust out supplicating\nhands to the shapes.\n\n\"Don't hurt him any more! He didn't mean it!\" she cried out to them\npiteously--like a child. She reached up, caught one of Norhala's hands.\n\"Norhala--don't let them kill him. Don't let them hurt him any more.\nPlease!\" she sobbed.\n\nBeside me I heard Drake cursing.\n\n\"If they touch her I'll kill the woman! I will, by God I will!\" He\nstrode to Norhala's side.\n\n\"If you want to live, call off these devils of yours.\" His voice was\nstrangled.\n\nShe looked at him, wonder deepening on the tranquil brow, in the clear,\nuntroubled gaze. Of course she could not understand his words--but it\nwas not that which made my own sick apprehension grow.\n\nIt was that she did not understand what called them forth. Did not even\nunderstand what reason lay behind Ruth's sorrow, Ruth's prayer.\n\nAnd more and more wondering grew in her eyes as she looked from the\nthreatening Drake to the supplicating Ruth, and from them to the still\nbody of Ventnor.\n\n\"Tell her what I say, Goodwin. I mean it.\"\n\nI shook my head. That was not the way, I knew. I looked toward the Disk,\nstill flanked with its sextette of spheres, still guarded by the flaming\nblue stars. They were motionless, calm, watching. I sensed no hostility,\nno anger; it was as though they were waiting for us to--to--waiting for\nus to do what?\n\nIt came to me--they were indifferent. That was it--as indifferent as we\ncould be to the struggle of an ephemera; and as mildly curious.\n\n\"Norhala,\" I turned to the woman, \"she would not have him suffer; she\nwould not have him die. She loves him.\"\n\n\"Love?\" she repeated, and all of her wonderment seemed crystallized in\nthe word. \"Love?\" she asked.\n\n\"She loves him,\" I said; and then, why I did not know, but I added,\npointing to Drake: \"and he loves her.\"\n\nThere was a tiny, astonished sob from Ruth. Again Norhala brooded over\nher. Then with a little despairing shake of her head, she paced over and\nfaced the great Disk.\n\n\nTensely we waited. Communication there was between them, interchange\nof--thought; how carried out I would not hazard even to myself.\n\nBut of a surety these two--the goddess woman, the wholly unhuman shape\nof metal, of jeweled fires and conscious force--understood each other.\n\nFor she turned, stood aside--and the body of Ventnor quivered, arose\nfrom the floor, stood upright and with closed eyes, head dropping upon\none shoulder, glided toward the Disk like a dead man carried by those\nmessengers never seen by man who, the Arabs believe, bear the death\ndrugged souls before Allah for their awakening.\n\nRuth moaned and hid her eyes; Drake reached down, gathered her up in his\narms, held her close.\n\nVentnor's body stood before the Disk, then swam up along its face. The\ntendrils waved out, felt of it, thrust themselves down through the wide\ncollar of the shirt. The floating form passed higher, over the edge of\nthe Disk; lay high beside the right star point of the rayed shape to\nwhich Ruth had been passing when Ventnor's shot brought the tragedy upon\nus. I saw other tentacles whip forth, examine, caress.\n\nThen down the body swung, was borne through air, laid gently at our\nfeet.\n\n\"He is not--dead,\" it was Norhala beside me; she lifted Ruth's face from\nDrake's breast. \"He will not die. It may be he will walk again. They\ncan not help,\" there was a shadow of apology in her tones. \"They did\nnot know. They thought it was the\"--she hesitated as though at loss for\nwords--\"the--the Fire Play.\"\n\n\"The Fire Play?\" I gasped.\n\n\"Yes,\" she nodded. \"You shall see it. And now I will take him to my\nhouse. You are safe--now, nor need you trouble. For he has given you to\nme.\"\n\n\"Who has given us to you--Norhala?\" I asked, as calmly as I could.\n\n\"He\"--she nodded to the Disk, then spoke the phrase that was both\nancient Assyria's and ancient Persia's title for their all-conquering\nrulers, and that meant--\"the King of Kings. The Great King, Master of\nLife and Death.\"\n\nShe took Ruth from Drake's arms, pointing to Ventnor.\n\n\"Bear him,\" she commanded, and led the way back through the walls of\nlight.\n\nAs we lifted the body, I slipped my hand through the shirt, felt at the\nheart. Faint was the pulsation and slow, but regular.\n\nClose to the encircling vapors I cast one look behind me. The shapes\nstood immobile, flashing disks, gigantic radiant stars and the six great\nspheres beneath their geometric super-Euclidean god or shrine or machine\nof interwoven threads of luminous force and metal--still motionless,\nstill watching.\n\nWe emerged into the place of pillars. There stood the hooded pony and\nits patience, its uncomplaining acceptance of its place as servant to\nman brought a lump into my throat, salved, I suppose, my human vanity,\nabased as it had been by the colossal indifference of those things to\nwhich we were but playthings.\n\nAgain Norhala sent forth her call. Out of the maze glided her quintette\nof familiars; again the four clicked into one. Upon its top we lifted,\nDrake ascending first, the pony; then the body of Ventnor.\n\nI saw Norhala lead Ruth to the remaining cube; saw the girl break away\nfrom her, leap beside me, and kneeling at her brother's head, cradle\nit against her soft breast. Then as I found in the medicine case the\nhypodermic needle and the strychnine for which I had been searching, I\nbegan my examination of Ventnor.\n\nThe cubes quivered--swept away through the forest of columns.\n\nWe crouched, the three of us, blind to anything that lay about us,\nheedless of whatever road of wonders we were on, striving to strengthen\nin Ventnor the spark of life so near extinction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. \"I WILL GIVE YOU PEACE\"\n\nIn our concentration upon Ventnor none of us had given thought to the\npassing of time, nor where we were going. We stripped him to the waist,\nand while Ruth massaged head and neck, Drake's strong fingers kneaded\nchest and abdomen. I had used to the utmost my somewhat limited medical\nknowledge.\n\nWe had found no mark nor burn upon him, not even upon his hands over\nwhich had run the licking flame. The slightly purplish, cyanotic\ntinge of his skin had given way to a clear pallor; the skin was itself\ndisquietingly cold, the blood-pressure only slightly subnormal. The\npulse was more rapid, stronger; the breathing faint but regular, and\nwith no laboring. The pupils of his eyes were contracted almost to the\npoint of invisibility.\n\nI could get no nervous reactions whatever. I am familiar with the\neffects of electric shock and know what to do in such cases, but\nVentnor's symptoms, while similar in part, presented other features\nunknown to me and most puzzling. There was a passive automatism, a\nperplexing muscular rigidity which caused arms and legs, hands and head\nto remain, doll-like, in any position placed.\n\nSeveral times during my labors I had been aware of Norhala gazing down\nupon us; but she made no effort to help, nor did she speak.\n\nNow, my strained attention relaxing, I began to receive and note\nimpressions from without. There was a different feeling in the air,\na diminution of the magnetic tension; I smelled the blessed breath of\ntrees and water.\n\nThe light about us was clear and pearly, about the intensity of the moon\nat full. Looking back along the way we had been traveling, I saw a half\nmile away vertical, knife-sharp edges of two facing cliffs, the gap\nbetween them a mile or more wide.\n\nThrough them we must have passed, for beyond them were the radiant mists\nof the pit of the city, and through this precipitous gateway filtered\nthe enveloping luminosity. On each side of us uprose gradually\nconverging and perpendicular scarps along whose base huddled a sparse\nfoliage.\n\nThere came a low whistle of astonishment from Drake; I turned. We were\nslowly gliding toward something that looked like nothing so much as a\nhuge and shimmering bubble of mingled sapphire and turquoise, swimming\nup from and two-thirds above and the balance still hidden within earth.\nIt seemed to draw to itself the light, sending it back with gleamings\nof the gray-blue of the star sapphire, with pellucid azures and lazulis\nlike clouded jades, with glistening peacock iridescences and tender,\nmilky greens of tropic shallows.\n\nLittle turrets globular and topaz, yellow and pierced with tiny\nhexagonal openings clustered about it like baby bubbles just nestling\ndown to rest.\n\nGreat trees shadowed it, unfamiliar trees among whose glossy leaves\nblossomed in wreaths flowers pink and white as apple-blossoms.\nFrom their graceful branches strange fruits, golden and scarlet and\npear-shaped, hung pendulous.\n\nIt was an elfin palace; a goblin dwelling; such a bower as some\nmirthful, beauty-loving Jinn King of Jewels might have built from\nenchanted hoards for some well-beloved daughter of earth.\n\nAll of fifty feet in height was the blue globe, and up to a wide and\novaled entrance ran a broad and shining roadway. Along this the cubes\nswept and stopped.\n\n\"My house,\" murmured Norhala.\n\nThe attraction that had held us to the surface of the blocks relaxed,\nangled through changed and assisting lines of force; the hosts of\nminute eyes sparkling quizzically, interestedly, at us, we gently slid\nVentnor's body; lifted down the pony.\n\n\"Enter,\" sighed Norhala, and waved a welcoming hand.\n\n\"Tell her to wait a minute,\" ordered Drake.\n\nHe slipped the bandage from off the pony's head, threw off the\nsaddlebags, and led it to the side of the roadway where thick, lush\ngrass was growing, spangled with flowerets. There he hobbled it and\nrejoined us. Together we picked up Ventnor and passed slowly through the\nportal.\n\nWe stood in a shadowed chamber. The light that filled it was\ntranslucent, and oddly enough with little of the bluish quality I had\nexpected. Crystalline it was; the shadows crystalline, too, rigid--like\nthe facets of great crystals. And as my eyes accustomed themselves I saw\nthat what I had thought shadows actually were none.\n\nThey were slices of semitransparent stone like pale moonstones,\nspringing from the curving walls and the high dome, and bisecting and\nintersecting the chamber. They were pierced with oval doorways over\nwhich fell glimmering metallic curtains--silk of silver and gold.\n\nI glimpsed a pile of this silken stuff near by, and as we laid our\nburden upon it Ruth caught my arm with a little frightened cry.\n\nThrough a curtained oval sidled a figure.\n\nBlack and tall, its long and gnarled arms swung apelike; its shoulders\nwere distorted, one so much longer than the other that the hand upon\nthat side hung far below the knee.\n\nIt walked with a curious, crablike motion. Upon its face were stamped\ncountless wrinkles and its blackness seemed less that of pigmentation\nthan the weathering of unbelievable years, the very stain of\nancientness. And about neither face nor figure was there anything to\nshow whether it was man or woman.\n\nFrom the twisted shoulders a short and sleeveless red tunic fell.\nIncredibly old the creature was--and by its corded muscles, its sinewy\ntendons, as incredibly powerful. It raised within me a half sick\nrevulsion, loathing. But the eyes were not ancient, no. Irisless,\nlashless, black and brilliant, they blazed out of the face's carven web\nof wrinkles, intent upon Norhala and filled with a flame of worship.\n\n\nIt threw itself at her feet, prostrate, the inordinately long arms\noutstretched.\n\n\"Mistress!\" it whined in a high and curiously unpleasant falsetto.\n\"Great lady! Goddess!\"\n\nShe stretched out a sandaled foot, touched one of the black taloned\nhands, and at the contact I saw a shiver of ecstasy run through the lank\nbody. \"Yuruk--\" she began, and paused, regarding us.\n\n\"The goddess speaks! Yuruk hears! The goddess speaks!\" It was a chant of\nadoration.\n\n\"Yuruk. Rise. Look upon the strangers.\"\n\nThe creature--and now I knew what it was--writhed, twisted, and\nhideously apelike crouched upon its haunches, hands knuckling the floor.\n\nBy the amazement in the unwinking eyes it was plain that not till now\nhad the eunuch taken cognizance of us. The amazement fled, was replaced\nwith a black fire of malignancy, of hatred--jealousy.\n\n\"Augh!\" he snarled; leaped to his feet; thrust an arm toward Ruth. She\ngave a little cry, cowered against Drake.\n\n\"None of that!\" He struck down the clutching arm.\n\n\"Yuruk!\" There was a hint of anger in the bell-toned voice. \"Yuruk,\nthese belong to me. No harm must come to them. Yuruk--beware!\"\n\n\"The goddess commands. Yuruk obeys.\" If fear quavered in the words,\nbeneath was more than a trace of a sullenness, too, sinister enough.\n\n\"That's a nice little playmate for her new playthings,\" muttered Drake.\n\"If that bird gets the least bit gay--I shoot him pronto.\" He gave Ruth\na reassuring hug. \"Cheer up, Ruth. Don't mind that thing. He's something\nwe can handle.\"\n\nNorhala waved a white hand; Yuruk sidled over to one of the curtained\novals and through it, reappearing almost instantly with a huge platter\nupon which were fruits, and a curdly white liquid in bowls of thick\nporcelain.\n\n\"Eat,\" she said, as the gnarled black arms placed the platter at our\nfeet.\n\n\"Hungry?\" asked Drake. Ruth shook her head violently.\n\n\"I'm going out for the saddlebags,\" said Drake. \"We'll use our own\nstuff--while it lasts. I'm taking no chances on what the Yuruk lad\nbrings--with all due respect to Norhala's good intentions.\"\n\nHe started for the doorway; the eunuch blocked his way.\n\n\"We have with us food of our own, Norhala,\" I explained. \"He goes to get\nit.\"\n\nShe nodded indifferently; clapped her hands. Yuruk shrank back, and out\nstrode Drake.\n\n\"I am weary,\" sighed Norhala. \"The way was long. I will refresh\nmyself--\"\n\nShe stretched out a foot toward Yuruk. He knelt, unlaced the turquoise\nbands, drew off the sandals. Her hands sought her breast, dwelt for an\ninstant there.\n\nDown slipped her silken veils, clingingly, slowly, as though reluctant\nto unclasp her; whispering they fell from the high and tender breasts,\nthe delicate rounded hips, and clustered about her feet in soft\npetalings as of some flower of pale amber foam. Out of the calyx of that\nflower arose the gleaming miracle of her body crowned with glowing glory\nof her cloudy hair.\n\nNaked she was, yet clothed with an unearthly purity, the purity of the\nfar-flung, serene stars, of the eternal snows upon some calm, high-flung\npeak, the tranquil, silver dawns of spring; protected by some spell of\ndivinity which chilled and slew the flame of desire. A maiden Ishtar, a\nvirginal Isis; a woman--yet with no more of woman's lure than if she had\nbeen some exquisite and breathing statue of mingled ivory and milk of\npearls.\n\nSo she stood, indifferent to us who gazed upon her, withdrawn, musing,\nas though she had forgotten us. And that serene indifference, with its\nentire absence of what we term sex consciousness, revealed to me once\nmore how great was the abyss between us and her.\n\nSlowly she raised her arms, wound the floating tresses into a coronal.\nI saw Drake enter with the saddlebags; saw them drop from hands relaxing\nunder the shock of this amazing tableau; saw his eyes widen and fill\nwith wonder and half-awed admiration.\n\nNow Norhala stepped out of her fallen robes and moved toward the further\nwall, Yuruk following. He stooped, raised an ewer of silver and began\ngently to pour over her shoulders its contents. Again and again he bent\nand filled the vessel, dipping it into a shallow basin from which came\nthe bubbling and chuckling of a little spring. And again I marveled at\nthe marble smoothness and fineness of her skin on which the caressing\nwater left tiny silvery globules, gemming it. The eunuch slithered to\none side, drew from a quaint chest clothes of white floss; patted her\ndry with them; threw over her shoulders a silken robe of blue.\n\nBack she floated to us; hovered over Ruth, crouching with her brother's\nhead upon her knees.\n\nShe made a motion as though to draw the girl to her; hesitated as Ruth's\nface set in a passion of denial. A shadow of kindness drifted through\nthe wide, mysterious eyes; a shadow of pity joined it as she looked\ncuriously down on Ventnor.\n\n\"Bathe,\" she murmured, and pointed to the pool. \"And rest. No harm shall\ncome to any of you here. And you--\" A hand rested for a moment lightly\non the girl's curly head. \"When you desire it--I will again give\nyou--peace!\"\n\nShe parted the curtains, and the eunuch still following, was hidden\nbeyond them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. \"VOICE FROM THE VOID\"\n\nHelplessly we looked at each other. Then called forth perhaps by what\nshe saw in Drake's eyes, perhaps by another thought, Ruth's cheeks\ncrimsoned, her head drooped; the web of her hair hid the warm rose of\nher face, the frozen pallor of Ventnor's.\n\nAbruptly, she sprang to her feet. \"Walter! Dick! Something's happening\nto Martin!\"\n\nBefore she had ceased we were beside her; bending over Ventnor. His\nmouth was opening, slowly, slowly--with an effort agonizing to watch.\nThen his voice came through lips that scarcely moved; faint, faint as\nthough it floated from infinite distances, a ghost of a voice whispering\nwith phantom breath out of a dead throat.\n\n\"Hard--hard! So hard!\" the whispering complained. \"Don't know how long I\ncan keep connection--with voice.\n\n\"Was fool to shoot. Sorry--might have gotten you in worse trouble--but\ncrazy with fear for Ruth--thought, too, might be worth chance.\nSorry--not my usual line--\"\n\nThe thin thread of sound ceased. I felt my eyes fill with tears; it was\nlike Ventnor to flay himself like this for what he thought stupidity,\nlike him to make this effort to admit his supposed fault and crave\nforgiveness--as like him as that mad attack upon the flaming Disk in its\nown temple, surrounded by its ministers, had been so bafflingly unlike\nhis usual cool, collected self.\n\n\"Martin,\" I called, bending closer, \"it's nothing, old friend. No one\nblames you. Try to rouse yourself.\"\n\n\"Dear,\" it was Ruth, passionately tender, \"it's me. Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Only speck of consciousness and motionless in the void,\" the whisper\nbegan again. \"Terribly alive, terribly alone. Seem outside space\nyet--still in body. Can't see, hear, feel--short-circuited from every\nsense--but in some strange way realize you--Ruth, Walter, Drake.\n\n\"See without seeing--here floating in darkness that is also light--black\nlight--indescribable. In touch, too, with these--\"\n\nAgain the voice trailed into silence; returned, word and phrase pouring\nforth disconnected, with a curious and turbulent rhythm, like rushing\nwave crests linked by half-seen threads of the spindrift, vocal\nfragments of thought swiftly assembled by some subtle faculty of the\nmind as they fell into a coherent, incredible message.\n\n\"Group consciousness--gigantic--operating within our sphere--operating\nalso in spheres of vibration, energy, force--above, below one to which\nhumanity reacts--perception, command forces known to us--but in\ngreater degree--cognizant, manipulate unknown energies--senses known to\nus--unknown--can't realize them fully--impossible cover, only impinge\non contact points akin to our senses, forces--even these profoundly\nmodified by additional ones--metallic, crystalline, magnetic,\nelectric--inorganic with every power of organic--consciousness basically\nsame as ours--profoundly changed by differences in mechanism through\nwhich it finds expression--difference our bodies--theirs.\n\n\"Conscious, mobile--inexorable, invulnerable. Getting clearer--see more\nclearly--see--\" the voice shrilled out in a shuddering, thin lash of\ndespair--\"No! No--oh, God--no!\"\n\nThen clearly and solemnly:\n\n\"And God said: let us make men in our image, after our likeness, and\nlet them have dominion over all the earth, and every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth.\"\n\nA silence; we bent closer, listening; the still, small voice took up\nthe thread once more--but clearly further on. Something we had missed\nbetween that text from Genesis and what we were now hearing; something\nthat even as he had warned us, he had not been able to articulate. The\nwhisper broke through clearly in the middle of a sentence.\n\n\"Nor is Jehovah the God of myriads of millions who through those same\ncenturies, and centuries upon centuries before them, found earth a\ngarden and grave--and all these countless gods and goddesses only\nphantom barriers raised by man to stand between him and the eternal\nforces man's instinct has always warned him are ever in readiness to\ndestroy. That do destroy him as soon as his vigilance relaxes, his\nresistance weakens--the eternal, ruthless law that will annihilate\nhumanity the instant it runs counter to that law and turns its will and\nstrength against itself--\"\n\nA little pause; then came these singular sentences:\n\n\"Weaklings praying for miracles to make easy the path their own wills\nshould clear. Beggars who whine for alms from dreams. Shirkers each\nstruggling to place upon his god the burden whose carrying and whose\ncarrying alone can give him strength to walk free and unafraid, himself\ngodlike among the stars.\"\n\nAnd now distinctly, unfalteringly, the voice went on:\n\n\"Dominion over all the earth? Yes--as long as man is fit to rule; no\nlonger. Science has warned us. Where was the mammal when the giant\nreptiles reigned? Slinking hidden and afraid in the dark and secret\nplaces. Yet man sprang from these skulking beasts.\n\n\"For how long a time in the history of earth has man been master of it?\nFor a breath--for a cloud's passing. And will remain master only until\nsomething grown stronger wrests mastery from him--even as he wrested it\nfrom his ravening kind--as they took it from the reptiles--as did the\nreptiles from the giant saurians--which snatched it from the nightmare\nrulers of the Triassic--and so down to whatever held sway in the murk of\nearth dawn.\n\n\"Life! Life! Life! Life everywhere struggling for completion!\n\n\"Life crowding other life aside, battling for its moment of supremacy,\ngaining it, holding it for one rise and fall of the wings of time\nbeating through eternity--and then--hurled down, trampled under the feet\nof another straining life whose hour has struck.\n\n\"Life crowding outside every barred threshold in a million circling\nworlds, yes, in a million rushing universes; pressing against the doors,\nbursting them down, overwhelming, forcing out those dwellers who had\nthought themselves so secure.\n\n\"And these--these--\" the voice suddenly dropped, became thickly,\nvibrantly resonant, \"over the Threshold, within the House of Man--nor\ndoes he even dream that his doors are down. These--Things of metal whose\nbrains are thinking crystals--Things that suck their strength from the\nsun and whose blood is the lightning.\n\n\"The sun! The sun!\" he cried. \"There lies their weakness!\"\n\nThe voice rose in pitch, grew strident.\n\n\"Go back to the city! Go back to the city! Walter--Drake. They are not\ninvulnerable. No! The sun--strike them through the sun! Go into the\ncity--not invulnerable--the Keeper of the Cones--strike at the Cones\nwhen--the Keeper of the Cones--ah-h-h-ah--\"\n\nWe shrank back appalled, for from the parted, scarcely moving lips in\nthe unchanging face a gust of laughter, mad, mocking, terrifying, racked\nits way.\n\n\"Vulnerable--under the law--even as we! The Cones!\n\n\"Go!\" he gasped. A tremor shook him; slowly the mouth closed.\n\n\"Martin! Brother,\" wept Ruth. I thrust my hand into his breast; felt\nthe heart beating, with a curious suggestion of stubborn, unshakable\nstrength, as though every vital force had concentrated there as in a\nbeleaguered citadel.\n\nBut Ventnor himself, the consciousness that was Ventnor was gone; had\nwithdrawn into that subjective void in which he had said he floated--a\nlonely sentient atom, his one line of communication with us cut; severed\nfrom us as completely as though he were, as he had described it, outside\nspace.\n\nAnd Drake and I looked at each other's eyes, neither daring to be first\nto break the silence of which the muffled sobbing of the girl seemed to\nbe the sorrowful soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. \"FREE! BUT A MONSTER!\"\n\nThe peculiar ability of the human mind to slip so readily into the\nrefuge of the commonplace after, or even during, some well-nigh\nintolerable crisis, has been to me long one of the most interesting\nphenomena of our psychology.\n\nIt is instinctively a protective habit, of course, acquired through\nprecisely the same causes that had given to animals their protective\ncoloration--the stripes, say, of the zebra and tiger that blend so\ncunningly with the barred and speckled shadowings of bush and jungle,\nthe twig and leaflike shapes and hues of certain insects; in fact, all\nthat natural camouflage which was the basis of the art of concealment so\nastonishingly developed in the late war.\n\nLike the animals of the wild, the mind of man moves through a\njungle--the jungle of life, passing along paths beaten out by the\nthought of his countless forefathers in their progress from birth to\ndeath.\n\nAnd these paths are bordered and screened, figuratively and\nliterally, with bush and trees of his own selection, setting out and\ncultivation--shelters of the familiar, the habitual, the customary.\n\nOn these ancestral paths, within these barriers of usage, man moves\nhidden and secure as the animals in their haunts--or so he thinks.\n\nOutside them lie the wildernesses and the gardens of the unknown, and\nman's little trails are but rabbit-runs in an illimitable forest.\n\nBut they are home to him!\n\nTherefore it is that he scurries from some open place of revelation,\nsome storm of emotion, some strength-testing struggle, back into the\nshelter of the obvious; finding it an intellectual environment that\ndemands no slightest expenditure of mental energy or initiative,\nstrength to sally forth again into the unfamiliar.\n\nI crave pardon for this digression. I set it down because now I remember\nhow, when Drake at last broke the silence that had closed in upon\nthe passing of that still, small voice the essence of these thoughts\noccurred to me.\n\nHe strode over to the weeping girl, and in his voice was a roughness\nthat angered me until I realized his purpose.\n\n\"Get up, Ruth,\" he ordered. \"He came back once and he'll come back\nagain. Now let him be and help us get a meal together. I'm hungry.\"\n\nShe looked up at him, incredulously, indignation rising.\n\n\"Eat!\" she exclaimed. \"You can be hungry?\"\n\n\"You bet I can--and I am,\" he answered cheerfully. \"Come on; we've got\nto make the best of it.\"\n\n\"Ruth,\" I broke in gently, \"we'll all have to think about ourselves a\nlittle if we're to be of any use to him. You must eat--and then rest.\"\n\n\"No use crying in the milk even if it's spilt,\" observed Drake, even\nmore cheerfully brutal. \"I learned that at the front where we got so\nwe'd yelp for food even when the lads who'd been bringing it were all\nmixed up in it.\"\n\nShe lifted Ventnor's head from her lap, rested it on the silks; arose,\neyes wrathful, her little hands closed in fists as though to strike him.\n\n\"Oh--you brute!\" she whispered. \"And I thought--I thought--Oh, I hate\nyou!\"\n\n\"That's better,\" said Dick. \"Go ahead and hit me if you want. The madder\nyou get the better you'll feel.\"\n\nFor a moment I thought she was going to take him at his word; then her\nanger fled.\n\n\"Thanks--Dick,\" she said quietly.\n\nAnd while I sat studying Ventnor, they put together a meal from the\nstores, brewed tea over the spirit-lamp with water from the bubbling\nspring. In these commonplaces I knew that she at least was finding\nrelief from that strain of the abnormal under which we had labored so\nlong. To my surprise I found that I was hungry, and with deep relief I\nwatched Ruth partake of food and drink even though lightly.\n\nAbout her seemed to hover something of the ethereal, elusive, and\ndisquieting. Was it the strangely pellucid light that gave the effect, I\nwondered; and knew it was not, for as I scanned her covertly, there\nfell upon her face that shadow of inhuman tranquillity, of unearthly\nwithdrawal which, I guessed, had more than anything else maddened\nVentnor into his attack upon the Disk.\n\nI watched her fight against it, drive it back. White lipped, she raised\nher head and met my gaze. And in her eyes I read both terror and--shame.\n\nIt came to me that painful as it might be for her the time for\nquestioning had come.\n\n\"Ruth,\" I said, \"I know it's not necessary to remind you that we're in\na tight place. Every fact and every scrap of knowledge that we can lay\nhold of is of the utmost importance in enabling us to determine our\ncourse.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat your brother's question--what did Norhala do to\nyou? And what happened when you were floating before the Disk?\"\n\nThe blaze of interest in Drake's eyes at these questions changed to\namazement at her stricken recoil from them.\n\n\"There was nothing,\" she whispered--then defiantly--\"nothing. I don't\nknow what you mean.\"\n\n\"Ruth!\" I spoke sharply now, in my own perplexity. \"You do know. You\nmust tell us--for his sake.\" I pointed toward Ventnor.\n\n\nShe drew a long breath.\n\n\"You're right--of course,\" she said unsteadily. \"Only I--I thought maybe\nI could fight it out myself. But you'll have to know it--there's a taint\nupon me.\"\n\nI caught in Drake's swift glance the echo of my own thrill of\napprehension for her sanity.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, now quietly. \"Some new and alien thing within my heart,\nmy brain, my soul. It came to me from Norhala when we rode the flying\nblock, and--he--sealed upon me when I was in--his\"--again she crimsoned,\n\"embrace.\"\n\nAnd as we gazed at her, incredulously:\n\n\"A thing that urges me to forget you two--and Martin--and all the\nworld I've known. That tries to pull me from you--from all--to drift\nuntroubled in some vast calm filled with an ordered ecstasy of peace.\nAnd whose calling I want, God help me, oh, so desperately to heed!\n\n\"It whispered to me first,\" she said, \"from Norhala--when she put her\narm around me. It whispered and then seemed to float from her and cover\nme like--like a veil, and from head to foot. It was a quietness and\npeace that held within it a happiness at one and the same time utterly\ntranquil and utterly free.\n\n\"I seemed to be at the doorway to unknown ecstasies--and the life I had\nknown only a dream--and you, all of you--even Martin, dreams within a\ndream. You weren't--real--and you did not--matter.\"\n\n\"Hypnotism,\" muttered Drake, as she paused.\n\n\"No.\" She shook her head. \"No--more than that. The wonder of it\ngrew--and grew. I thrilled with it. I remember nothing of that ride, saw\nnothing--except that once through the peace enfolding me pierced warning\nthat Martin was in peril, and I broke through to see him clutching\nNorhala and to see floating up in her eyes death for him.\n\n\"And I saved him--and again forgot. Then, when I saw that\nbeautiful, flaming Shape--I felt no terror, no fear--only a\ntremendous--joyous--anticipation, as though--as though--\" She faltered,\nhung her head, then leaving that sentence unfinished, whispered: \"and\nwhen--it--lifted me it was as though I had come at last out of some\nendless black ocean of despair into the full sun of paradise.\"\n\n\"Ruth!\" cried Drake, and at the pain in his cry she winced.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, and held up a little, tremulous hand. \"You asked--and\nnow you must listen.\"\n\nShe was silent; and when once more she spoke her voice was low,\ncuriously rhythmic; her eyes rapt:\n\n\"I was free--free from every human fetter of fear or sorrow or love or\nhate; free even of hope--for what was there to hope for when everything\ndesirable was mine? And I was elemental; one with the eternal things yet\nfully conscious that I was--I.\n\n\"It was as though I were the shining shadow of a star afloat upon the\nbreast of some still and hidden woodland pool; as though I were a little\nwind dancing among the mountain tops; a mist whirling down a quiet glen;\na shimmering lance of the aurora pulsing in the high solitudes.\n\n\"And there was music--strange and wondrous music and terrible, but not\nterrible to me--who was part of it. Vast chords and singing themes that\nrang like clusters of little swinging stars and harmonies that were like\nthe very voice of infinite law resolving within itself all discords. And\nall--all--passionless, yet--rapturous.\n\n\"Out of the Thing that held me, out from its fires pulsed vitality--a\nflood of inhuman energy in which I was bathed. And it was as though this\nenergy were--reassembling me, fitting me even closer to the elemental\nthings, changing me fully into them.\n\n\"I felt the little tendrils touching, caressing--then came the shots.\nAwakening was--dreadful, a struggling back from drowning. I saw\nMartin--blasted. I drove the--the spell away from me, tore it away.\n\n\"And, O Walter--Dick--it hurt--it hurt--and for a breath before I ran\nto him it was like--like coming from a world in which there was no\ndisorder, no sorrow, no doubts, a rhythmic, harmonious world of light\nand music, into--into a world that was like a black and dirty kitchen.\n\n\"And it's there,\" her voice rose, hysterically. \"It's still within\nme--whispering, whispering; urging me away from you, from Martin, from\nevery human thing; bidding me give myself up, surrender my humanity.\n\n\"Its seal,\" she sobbed. \"No--HIS seal! An alien consciousness sealed\nwithin me, that tries to make the human me a slave--that waits to\novercome my will--and if I surrender gives me freedom, an incredible\nfreedom--but makes me, being still human, a--monster.\"\n\nShe hid her face in her hands, quivering.\n\n\"If I could sleep,\" she wailed. \"But I'm afraid to sleep. I think I\nshall never sleep again. For sleeping how do I know what I may be when I\nwake?\"\n\nI caught Drake's eye; he nodded. I slipped my hand down into the\nmedicine-case, brought forth a certain potent and tasteless combination\nof drugs which I carry upon explorations.\n\nI dropped a little into her cup, then held it to her lips. Like a child,\nunthinking, she obeyed and drank.\n\n\"But I'll not surrender.\" Her eyes were tragic. \"Never think it! I can\nwin--don't you know I can?\"\n\n\"Win?\" Drake dropped down beside her, drew her toward him. \"Bravest girl\nI've known--of course you'll win. And remember this--nine-tenths of what\nyou're thinking now is purely over-wrought nerves and weariness. You'll\nwin--and we'll win, never doubt it.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" she said. \"I know it--oh, it will be hard--but I will--I\nwill--\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. THE HOUSE OF NORHALA\n\nHer eyes closed, her body relaxed; the potion had done its work quickly.\nWe laid her beside Ventnor on the pile of silken stuffs, covered them\nboth with a fold, then looked at each other long and silently--and I\nwondered whether my face was as grim and drawn as his.\n\n\"It appears,\" he said at last, curtly, \"that it's up to you and me for\npowwow quick. I hope you're not sleepy.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" I answered as curtly; the edge of nerves in his manner of\nquestioning doing nothing to soothe my own, \"and even if I were I would\nhardly expect to put all the burden of the present problem upon you by\ngoing to sleep.\"\n\n\"For God's sake don't be a prima donna,\" he flared up. \"I meant no\noffense.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dick,\" I said. \"We're both a little jumpy, I guess.\" He\nnodded; gripped my hand.\n\n\"It wouldn't be so bad,\" he muttered, \"if all four of us were all\nright. But Ventnor's down and out, and God alone knows for how long. And\nRuth--has all the trouble we have and some special ones of her own. I've\nan idea\"--he hesitated--\"an idea that there was no exaggeration in that\nstory she told--an idea that if anything she underplayed it.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" I replied somberly. \"And to me it is the most hideous phase\nof this whole situation--and for reasons not all connected with Ruth,\" I\nadded.\n\n\"Hideous!\" he repeated. \"Unthinkable--yet all this is unthinkable.\nAnd still--it is! And Ventnor--coming back--that way. Like a lost soul\nfinding voice.\n\n\"Was it raving, Goodwin? Or could he have been--how was it he put it--in\ntouch with these Things and their purpose? Was that message--truth?\"\n\n\"Ask yourself that question,\" I said. \"Man--you know it was truth. Had\nnot inklings of it come to you even before he spoke? They had to me.\nHis message was but an interpretation, a synthesis of facts I, for one,\nlacked the courage to admit.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" he nodded. \"But he went further than that. What did he mean by\nthe Keeper of the Cones--and that the Things--were vulnerable under the\nsame law that orders us? And why did he command us to go back to the\ncity? How could he know--how could he?\"\n\n\"There's nothing inexplicable in that, at any rate,\" I answered.\n\"Abnormal sensitivity of perception due to the cutting off of all\nsensual impressions. There's nothing uncommon in that. You have its most\nfamiliar form in the sensitivity of the blind. You've watched the same\nthing at work in certain forms of hypnotic experimentation, haven't you?\n\n\"Through the operation of entirely understandable causes the mind gains\nthe power to react to vibrations that normally pass unperceived; is able\nto project itself through this keying up of perception into a wider area\nof consciousness than the normal. Just as in certain diseases of the ear\nthe sufferer, though deaf to sounds within the average range of hearing,\nis fully aware of sound vibrations far above and far below those the\nhealthy ear registers.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"I don't need to be convinced. But we accept these\nthings in theory--and when we get up against them for ourselves we\ndoubt.\n\n\"How many people are there in Christendom, do you think, who believe\nthat the Saviour ascended from the dead, but who if they saw it today\nwould insist upon medical inspection, doctor's certificates, a\nclinic, and even after that render a Scotch verdict? I'm not speaking\nirreverently--I'm just stating a fact.\"\n\nSuddenly he moved away from me, strode over to the curtained oval\nthrough which Norhala had gone.\n\n\"Dick,\" I cried, following him hastily, \"where are you going? What are\nyou going to do?\"\n\n\"I'm going after Norhala,\" he answered. \"I'm going to have a showdown\nwith her or know the reason why.\"\n\n\"Drake,\" I cried again, aghast, \"don't make the mistake Ventnor did.\nThat's not the way to win through. Don't--I beg you, don't.\"\n\n\"You're wrong,\" he answered stubbornly. \"I'm going to get her. She's got\nto talk.\"\n\nHe thrust out a hand to the curtains. Before he could touch them, they\nwere parted. Out from between them slithered the black eunuch. He stood\nmotionless, regarding us; in the ink-black eyes a red flame of hatred. I\npushed myself between him and Drake.\n\n\"Where is your mistress, Yuruk?\" I asked.\n\n\"The goddess has gone,\" he replied sullenly.\n\n\"Gone?\" I said suspiciously, for certainly Norhala had not passed us.\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Who shall question the goddess?\" he asked. \"She comes and she goes as\nshe pleases.\"\n\nI translated this for Drake.\n\n\"He's got to show me,\" he said. \"Don't think I'm going to spill any\nbeans, Goodwin. But I want to talk to her. I think I'm right, honestly I\ndo.\"\n\n\nAfter all, I reflected, there was much in his determination to recommend\nit. It was the obvious thing to do--unless we admitted that Norhala was\nsuperhuman; and that I would not admit. In command of forces we did not\nyet know, en rapport with these People of Metal, sealed with that alien\nconsciousness Ruth had described--all these, yes. But still a woman--of\nthat I was certain. And surely Drake could be trusted not to repeat\nVentnor's error.\n\n\"Yuruk,\" I said, \"we think you lie. We would speak to your mistress.\nTake us to her.\"\n\n\"I have told you that the goddess is not here,\" he said. \"If you do not\nbelieve it is nothing to me. I cannot take you to her for I do not know\nwhere she is. Is it your wish that I take you through her house?\"\n\n\"It is,\" I said.\n\n\"The goddess has commanded me to serve you in all things.\" He bowed,\nsardonically. \"Follow.\"\n\nOur search was short. We stepped out into what for want of better words\nI can describe only as a central hall. It was circular, and strewn with\nthick piled small rugs whose hues had been softened by the alchemy of\ntime into exquisite, shadowy echoes of color.\n\nThe walls of this hall were of the same moonstone substance that had\nenclosed the chamber upon whose inner threshold we were. They whirled\nstraight up to the dome in a crystalline, cylindrical cone. Four\ndoorways like that in which we stood pierced them. Through each of their\ncurtainings in turn we peered.\n\nAll were precisely similar in shape and proportions, radiating in a\nlunetted, curved base triangle from the middle chamber; the curvature of\nthe enclosing globe forming back wall and roof; the translucent slicings\nthe sides; the circle of floor of the inner hall the truncating lunette.\n\nThe first of these chambers was utterly bare. The one opposite held a\nhalf-dozen suits of the lacquered armor, as many wicked looking, short\nand double-edged swords and long javelins. The third I judged to be the\nlair of Yuruk; within it was a copper brazier, a stand of spears and a\ngigantic bow, a quiver full of arrows leaning beside it. The fourth room\nwas littered with coffers great and small, of wood and of bronze, and\nall tightly closed.\n\nThe fifth room was beyond question Norhala's bedchamber. Upon its floor\nthe ancient rugs were thick. A low couch of carven ivory inset with gold\nrested a few feet from the doorway. A dozen or more of the chests were\nscattered about and flowing over with silken stuffs.\n\nUpon the back of four golden lions stood a high mirror of polished\nsilver. And close to it, in curiously incongruous domestic array stood\na stiffly marshaled row of sandals. Upon one of the chests were heaped\ncombs and fillets of shell and gold and ivory studded with jewels blue\nand yellow and crimson.\n\nTo all of these we gave but a passing glance. We sought for Norhala.\nAnd of her we found no shadow. She had gone even as the black eunuch had\nsaid; flitting unseen past Ruth, perhaps, absorbed in her watch over her\nbrother; perhaps through some hidden opening in this room of hers.\n\nYuruk let drop the curtains, sidled back to the first room, we after\nhim. The two there had not moved. We drew the saddlebags close, propped\nourselves against them.\n\nThe black eunuch squatted a dozen feet away, facing us, chin upon his\nknees, taking us in with unblinking eyes blank of any emotion. Then\nhe began to move slowly his tremendously long arms in easy, soothing\nmotion, the hands running along the floor upon their talons in arcs\nand circles. It was curious how these hands seemed to be endowed with a\nvolition of their own, independent of the arms upon which they swung.\n\nAnd now I could see only the hands, shuttling so smoothly, so\nrhythmically back and forth--weaving so sleepily, so sleepily back and\nforth--black hands that dripped sleep--hypnotic.\n\nHypnotic! I sprang from the lethargy closing upon me. In one quick side\nglance I saw Drake's head nodding--nodding in time to the movement of\nthe black hands. I jumped to my feet, shaking with an intensity of rage\nunfamiliar to me; thrust my pistol into the wrinkled face.\n\n\"Damn you!\" I cried. \"Stop that. Stop it and turn your back.\"\n\nThe corded muscles of the arms contracted, the claws of the slithering\npaws drew in as though he were about to clutch me; the ebon pools of\neyes were covered with a frozen film of hate.\n\nHe could not have known what was this tube with which I menaced him,\nbut its threat he certainly sensed and was afraid to meet. He squattered\nabout, wrapped his arms around his knees, crouched with back toward us.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Drake drowsily.\n\n\"He tried to hypnotize us,\" I answered shortly. \"And pretty nearly did.\"\n\n\"So that's what it was.\" He was now wide awake. \"I watched those hands\nof his and got sleepier and sleepier--I guess we'd better tie Mr. Yuruk\nup.\" He jumped to his feet.\n\n\"No,\" I said, restraining him. \"No. He's safe enough as long as we're on\nthe alert. I don't want to use any force on him yet. Wait until we know\nwe can get something worth while by doing it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he nodded, grimly. \"But when the time comes I'm telling you\nstraight, Doc, I'm going the limit. There's something about that human\nspider that makes me itch to squash him--slowly.\"\n\n\"I'll have no compunction--when it's worth while,\" I answered as grimly.\n\nWe sank down again against the saddlebags; Drake brought out a black\npipe, looked at it sorrowfully; at me appealingly.\n\n\"All mine was on that pony that bolted,\" I answered his wistfulness.\n\n\"All mine was on my beast, too,\" he sighed. \"And I lost my pouch in that\nspurt from the ruins.\"\n\nHe sighed again, clamped white teeth down upon the stem.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said at last, \"if Ventnor was right in that--that\ndisembodied analysis of his, it's rather--well, terrifying, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's all of that,\" I replied, \"and considerably more.\"\n\n\"Metal, he said,\" Drake mused. \"Things of metal with brains of thinking\ncrystal and their blood the lightnings. You accept that?\"\n\n\"So far as my own observation has gone--yes,\" I said. \"Metallic yet\nmobile. Inorganic but with all the quantities we have hitherto thought\nonly those of the organic and with others added. Crystalline, of course,\nin structure and highly complex. Activated by magnetic-electric forces\nconsciously exerted and as much a part of their life as brain energy\nand nerve currents are of our human life. Animate, moving, sentient\ncombinations of metal and electric energy.\"\n\nHe said:\n\n\"The opening of the Disk from the globe and of the two blasting stars\nfrom the pyramids show the flexibility of the outer--plate would you\ncall it? I couldn't help thinking of the armadillo after I had time to\nthink at all.\"\n\n\"It may be\"--I struggled against the conviction now strong upon me--\"it\nmay be that within that metallic shell is an organic body, something\nsoft--animal, as there is within the horny carapace of the turtle, the\nnacreous valves of the oyster, the shells of the crustaceans--it may be\nthat even their inner surface is organic--\"\n\n\"No,\" he interrupted, \"if there is a body--as we know a body--it must\nbe between the outer surface and the inner, for the latter is crystal,\njewel hard, impenetrable.\n\n\"Goodwin--Ventnor's bullets hit fair. I saw them strike. They did not\nricochet--they dropped dead. Like flies dashed up against a rock--and\nthe Thing was no more conscious of their striking than a rock would have\nbeen of those flies.\"\n\n\n\"Drake,\" I said, \"my own conviction is that these creatures are\nabsolutely metallic, entirely inorganic--incredible, unknown forms. Let\nus go on that basis.\"\n\n\"I think so, too,\" he nodded; \"but I wanted you to say it first. And\nyet--is it so incredible, Goodwin? What is the definition of vital\nintelligence--sentience?\n\n\"Haeckel's is the accepted one. Anything which can receive a stimulus,\nthat can react to a stimulus and retains memory of a stimulus must be\ncalled an intelligent, conscious entity. The gap between what we have\nlong called the organic and the inorganic is steadily decreasing. Do you\nknow of the remarkable experiments of Lillie upon various metals?\"\n\n\"Vaguely,\" I said.\n\n\"Lillie,\" he went on, \"proved that under the electric current and other\nexciting mediums metals exhibited practically every reaction of the\nhuman nerve and muscle. It grew weary, rested, and after resting\nwas perceptibly stronger than before; it got what was practically\nindigestion, and it exhibited a peculiar but unmistakable memory. Also,\nhe found, it could acquire disease and die.\n\n\"Lillie concluded that there existed a real metallic consciousness. It\nwas Le Bon who first proved also that metal is more sensitive than\nman, and that its immobility is only apparent. (Le Bon in 'Evolution of\nMatter,' Chapter eleven.)\n\n\"Take the block of magnetic iron that stands so gray and apparently\nlifeless, subject it to a magnetic current lifeless, what happens? The\niron block is composed of molecules which under ordinary conditions are\ndisposed in all possible directions indifferently. But when the current\npasses through there is tremendous movement in that apparently inert\nmass. All of the tiny particles of which it is composed turn and shift\nuntil their north poles all point more or less approximately in the\ndirection of the magnetic force.\n\n\"When that happens the block itself becomes a magnet, filled with and\nsurrounded by a field of magnetic energy; instinct with it. Outwardly it\nhas not moved; actually there has been prodigious motion.\"\n\n\"But it is not conscious motion,\" I objected.\n\n\"Ah, but how do you know?\" he asked. \"If Jacques Loeb* is right, that\naction of the iron molecules is every bit as conscious a movement as\nthe least and the greatest of our own. There is absolutely no difference\nbetween them.\n\n\"Your and my and its every movement is nothing but an involuntary and\ninevitable reaction to a certain stimulus. If he's right, then I'm a\nbuttercup--but that's neither here nor there. Loeb--all he did was\nto restate destiny, one of humanity's oldest ideas, in the terms of\ntropisms, infusoria and light. Omar Khayyam chemically reincarnated in\nthe Rockefeller Institute. Nevertheless those who accept his theories\nhave to admit that there is essentially no difference between their\nimpulses and the rush of filings toward a magnet.\n\n\"Equally nevertheless, Goodwin, the iron does meet Haeckel's three\ntests--it can receive a stimulus, it does react to that stimulus and it\nretains memory of it; for even after the current has ceased it remains\nchanged in tensile strength, conductivity and other qualities that were\nmodified by the passage of that current; and as time passes this memory\nfades. Precisely as some human experience increases wariness, caution,\nwhich keying up of qualities remains with us after the experience\nhas passed, and fades away in the ratio of our sensitivity plus\nretentiveness divided by the time elapsing from the original\nexperience--exactly as it is in the iron.\"\n\n     * Professor Jacques Loeb, of the Rockefeller Institute, New\n     York, \"The Mechanistic Conception of Life.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. CONSCIOUS METAL!\n\n\"Granted,\" I acquiesced. \"We now come to their means of locomotion. In\nits simplest terms all locomotion is progress through space against\nthe force of gravitation. Man's walk is a series of rhythmic stumbles\nagainst this force that constantly strives to drag him down to earth's\nface and keep him pressed there. Gravitation is an etheric--magnetic\nvibration akin to the force which holds, to use your simile again,\nDrake, the filing against the magnet. A walk is a constant breaking of\nthe current.\n\n\"Take a motion picture of a man walking and run it through the lantern\nrapidly and he seems to be flying. We have none of the awkward fallings\nand recoveries that are the tempo of walking as we see it.\n\n\"I take it that the movement of these Things is a conscious breaking of\nthe gravitational current just as much as is our own movement, but by a\nrhythm so swift that it appears to be continuous.\n\n\"Doubtless if we could so control our sight as to admit the vibrations\nof light slowly enough we would see this apparently smooth motion as a\nseries of leaps--just as we do when the motion-picture operator\nslows down his machine sufficiently to show us walking in a series of\nstumbles.\n\n\"Very well--so far, then, we have nothing in this phenomenon which the\nhuman mind cannot conceive as possible; therefore intellectually we\nstill remain masters of the phenomena; for it is only that which human\nthought cannot encompass which it need fear.\"\n\n\"Metallic,\" he said, \"and crystalline. And yet--why not? What are we but\nbags of skin filled with certain substances in solution and stretched\nover a supporting and mobile mechanism largely made up of lime? Out of\nthat primeval jelly which Gregory * calls Protobion came after untold\nmillions of years us with our skins, our nails, and our hair; came, too,\nthe serpents with their scales, the birds with their feathers; the horny\nhide of the rhinoceros and the fairy wings of the butterfly; the shell\nof the crab, the gossamer loveliness of the moth and the shimmering\nwonder of the mother-of-pearl.\n\n     * J. W. Gregory, F.R.S.D.Sc., Professor of Geology,\n     University of Glasgow.\n\n\"Is there any greater gap between any of these and the metallic? I think\nnot.\"\n\n\"Not materially,\" I answered. \"No. But there remains--consciousness!\"\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"I cannot understand. Ventnor spoke of--how did he put\nit?--a group consciousness, operating in our sphere and in spheres above\nand below ours, with senses known and unknown. I got--glimpses--Goodwin,\nbut I cannot understand.\"\n\n\"We have agreed for reasons that seem sufficient to us to call these\nThings metallic, Dick,\" I replied. \"But that does not necessarily mean\nthat they are composed of any metal that we know. Nevertheless, being\nmetal, they must be of crystalline structure.\n\n\"As Gregory has pointed out, crystals and what we call living matter had\nan equal start in the first essentials of life. We cannot conceive life\nwithout giving it the attribute of some sort of consciousness. Hunger\ncannot be anything but conscious, and there is no other stimulus to eat\nbut hunger.\n\n\"The crystals eat. The extraction of power from food is conscious\nbecause it is purposeful, and there can be no purpose without\nconsciousness; similarly the power to work from such derived energy is\nalso purposeful and therefore conscious. The crystals do both. And the\ncrystals can transmit all these abilities to their children, just as we\ndo. For although there would seem to be no reason why they should not\ncontinue to grow to gigantic size under favorable conditions--yet they\ndo not. They reach a size beyond which they do not develop.\n\n\"Instead, they bud--give birth, in fact--to smaller ones, which increase\nuntil they reach the size of the preceding generation. And like the\nchildren of man and animals, these younger generations grow on precisely\nas their progenitors!\n\n\"Very well, then--we arrive at the conception of a metallically\ncrystalline being, which by some explosion of the force of evolution\nhas burst from the to us familiar and apparently inert stage into these\nThings that hold us. And is there any greater difference between the\nforms with which we are familiar and them than there is between us and\nthe crawling amphibian which is our remote ancestor? Or between that and\nthe amoeba--the little swimming stomach from which it evolved? Or the\namoeba and the inert jelly of the Protobion?\n\n\"As for what Ventnor calls a group consciousness I would assume that\nhe means a communal intelligence such as that shown by the bees and the\nants--that in the case of the former Maeterlinck calls the 'Spirit\nof the Hive.' It is shown in their groupings--just as the geometric\narrangement of those groupings shows also clearly their crystalline\nintelligence.\n\n\"I submit that in their rapid coordination either for attack or movement\nor work without apparent communication having passed between the units,\nthere is nothing more remarkable than the swarming of a hive of bees\nwhere also without apparent communication just so many waxmakers,\nnurses, honey-gatherers, chemists, bread-makers, and all the varied\nspecialists of the hive go with the old queen, leaving behind sufficient\nnumber of each class for the needs of the young queen.\n\n\"All this apportionment is effected without any means of communication\nthat we recognize. Still it is most obviously intelligent selection.\nFor if it were haphazard all the honeymakers might leave and the hive\nstarve, or all the chemists might go and the food for the young bees not\nbe properly prepared--and so on and so on.\"\n\n\"But metal,\" he muttered, \"and conscious. It's all very well--but where\ndid that consciousness come from? And what is it? And where did they\ncome from? And most of all, why haven't they overrun the world before\nthis?\n\n\"Such development as theirs, such an evolution, presupposes aeons of\ntime--long as it took us to drag up from the lizards. What have\nthey been doing--why haven't they been ready to strike--if Ventnor's\nright--at humanity until now?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered, helplessly. \"But evolution is not the\nslow, plodding process that Darwin thought. There seem to be\nexplosions--nature will create a new form almost in a night. Then comes\nthe long ages of development and adjustment, and suddenly another new\nrace appears.\n\n\"It might be so of these--some extraordinary conditions that shaped\nthem. Or they might have developed through the ages in spaces within\nthe earth--there's that incredible abyss we saw that is evidently one of\ntheir highways. Or they might have dropped here upon some fragment of a\nbroken world, found in this valley the right conditions and developed in\namazing rapidity. * They're all possible theories--take your pick.\"\n\n     * Professor Svante Arrhenius's theory of propagation of life\n     by means of minute spores carried through space. See his\n     \"Worlds in the Making.\"--W.T.G.\n\n\"Something's held them back--and they're rushing to a climax,\" he\nwhispered. \"Ventnor's right about that--I feel it. And what can we do?\"\n\n\"Go back to their city,\" I said. \"Go back as he ordered. I believe he\nknows what he's talking about. And I believe he'll be able to help us.\nIt wasn't just a request he made, nor even an appeal--it was a command.\"\n\n\"But what can we do--just two men--against these Things?\" he groaned.\n\n\"Maybe we'll find out--when we're back in the city,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well,\" his old reckless cheerfulness came back to him, \"in every crisis\nof this old globe it's been up to one man to turn the trick. We're two.\nAnd at the worst we can only go down fighting a little before the rest\nof us. So, after all, whatEVER the hell, WHAT the hell.\"\n\nFor a time we were silent.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"we have to go to the city in the morning.\"\nHe laughed. \"Sounds as though we were living in the suburbs, somehow,\ndoesn't it?\"\n\n\"It can't be many hours before dawn,\" I said. \"Turn in for a while, I'll\nwake you when I think you've slept enough.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem fair,\" he protested, but sleepily.\n\n\"I'm not sleepy,\" I told him; nor was I.\n\nBut whether I was or not, I wanted to question Yuruk, uninterrupted and\nundisturbed.\n\nDrake stretched himself out. When his breathing showed him fast asleep\nindeed, I slipped over to the black eunuch and crouched, right hand\nclose to the butt of my automatic, facing him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. YURUK\n\n\"Yuruk,\" I whispered, \"you love us as the wheat field loves the hail;\nwe are as welcome to you as the death cord to the condemned. Lo, a door\nopened into a land of unpleasant dreams you thought sealed, and we came\nthrough. Answer my questions truthfully and it may be that we shall\nreturn through that door.\"\n\nInterest welled up in the depths of the black eyes.\n\n\"There is a way from here,\" he muttered. \"Nor does it pass\nthrough--Them. I can show it to you.\"\n\nI had not been blind to the flash of malice, of cunning, that had shot\nacross the wrinkled face.\n\n\"Where does that way lead?\" I asked. \"There were those who sought us;\nmen clad in armor with javelins and arrows. Does your way lead to them,\nYuruk?\"\n\nFor a time he hesitated, the lashless lids half closed.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said sullenly. \"The way leads to them; to their place. But\nwill it not be safer for you there--among your kind?\"\n\n\"I don't know that it will,\" I answered promptly. \"Those who are unlike\nus smote those who are like us and drove them back when they would have\ntaken and slain us. Why is it not better to remain with them than to go\nto our kind who would destroy us?\"\n\n\"They would not,\" he said \"If you gave them--her.\" He thrust a long\nthumb backward toward sleeping Ruth. \"Cherkis would forgive much for\nher. And why should you not? She is only a woman.\"\n\nHe spat--in a way that made me want to kill him.\n\n\"Besides,\" he ended, \"have you no arts to amuse him?\"\n\n\"Cherkis?\" I asked.\n\n\"Cherkis,\" he whined. \"Is Yuruk a fool not to know that in the world\nwithout, new things have arisen since long ago we fled from Iskander\ninto the secret valley? What have you to beguile Cherkis beyond this\nwoman flesh? Much, I think. Go then to him--unafraid.\"\n\nCherkis? There was a familiar sound to that. Cherkis? Of course--it\nwas the name of Xerxes, the Persian Conqueror, corrupted by time into\nthis--Cherkis. And Iskander? Equally, of course--Alexander. Ventnor had\nbeen right.\n\n\"Yuruk,\" I demanded directly, \"is she whom you call goddess--Norhala--of\nthe people of Cherkis?\"\n\n\"Long ago,\" he answered; \"long, long ago there was trouble in their\ncity, even in the great dwelling place of Cherkis. I fled with her who\nwas the mother of the goddess. There were twenty of us; and we fled\nhere--by the way which I will show you--\"\n\nHe leered cunningly; I gave no sign of interest.\n\n\"She who was the mother of the goddess found favor in the sight of the\nruler here,\" he went on. \"But after a time she grew old and ugly and\nwithered. So he slew her--like a little mound of dust she danced and\nblew away after he had slain her; and also he slew others who had grown\ndispleasing to him. He blasted me--as he was blasted--\" He pointed to\nVentnor.\n\n\"Then it was that, recovering, I found my crooked shoulder. The goddess\nwas born here. She is kin to Him Who Rules! How else could she shed the\nlightnings? Was not the father of Iskander the god Zeus Ammon, who came\nto Iskander's mother in the form of a great snake? Well? At any rate the\ngoddess was born--shedder of the lightnings even from her birth. And she\nis as you see her.\n\n\"Cleave to your kind! Cleave to your kind!\" Suddenly he shrilled.\n\"Better is it to be whipped by your brother than to be eaten by the\ntiger. Cleave to your kind. Look--I will show you the way to them.\"\n\nHe sprang to his feet, clasped my wrist in one of his long hands, led\nme through the curtained oval into the cylindrical hall, parted the\ncurtainings of Norhala's bedroom and pushed me within. Over the floor he\nslid, still holding fast to me, and pressed against the farther wall.\n\n\nAn ovoid slice of the gemlike material slid aside, revealing a doorway.\nI glimpsed a path, a trail, leading into a forest pallid green beneath\nthe wan light. This way thrust itself like a black tongue into the\nboskage and vanished in the depths.\n\n\"Follow it.\" He pointed. \"Take those who came with you and follow it.\"\n\nThe wrinkles upon his face writhed with his eagerness.\n\n\"You will go?\" panted Yuruk. \"You will take them and go by that path?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" I answered absently. \"Not yet.\"\n\nAnd was brought abruptly to full alertness, vigilance, by the flame of\nrage that filled the eyes thrust so close.\n\n\"Lead back,\" I directed curtly. He slid the door into place, turned\nsullenly. I followed, wondering what were the sources of the bitter\nhatred he so plainly bore for us; the reasons for his eagerness to be\nrid of us despite the commands of this woman who to him at least was\ngoddess.\n\nAnd by that curious human habit of seeking for the complex when the\nsimple answer lies close, failed to recognize that it was jealousy of\nus that was the root of his behavior; that he wished to be, as it would\nseem he had been for years, the only human thing near Norhala; failed\nto realize this, and with Ruth and Drake was terribly to pay for this\nfailure.\n\nI looked down upon the pair, sleeping soundly; upon Ventnor lost still\nin trance.\n\n\"Sit,\" I ordered the eunuch. \"And turn your back to me.\"\n\nI dropped down beside Drake, my mind wrestling with the mystery, but\nevery sense alert for movement from the black. Glibly enough I had\npassed over Dick's questioning as to the consciousness of the Metal\nPeople; now I faced it knowing it to be the very crux of these\nincredible phenomena; admitting, too, that despite all my special\npleading, about that point swirled in my own mind the thickest mists of\nuncertainty. That their sense of order was immensely beyond a man's was\nplain.\n\nAs plain was it that their knowledge of magnetic force and its\nmanipulation were far beyond the sphere of humanity. That they had\nrealization of beauty this palace of Norhala's proved--and no human\nimagination could have conceived it nor human hands have made its\nthought of beauty real. What were their senses through which their\nconsciousness fed?\n\nNine in number had been the sapphire ovals set within the golden zone of\nthe Disk. Clearly it came to me that these were sense organs!\n\nBut--nine senses!\n\nAnd the great stars--how many had they? And the cubes--did they open as\ndid globe and pyramid?\n\nConsciousness itself--after all what is it? A secretion of the brain?\nThe cumulative expression, wholly chemical, of the multitudes of cells\nthat form us? The inexplicable governor of the city of the body of which\nthese myriads of cells are the citizens--and created by them out of\nthemselves to rule?\n\nIs it what many call the soul? Or is it a finer form of matter, a\nself-realizing force, which uses the body as its vehicle just as other\nforces use for their vestments other machines? After all, I thought,\nwhat is this conscious self of ours, the ego, but a spark of realization\nrunning continuously along the path of time within the mechanism we call\nthe brain; making contact along that path as the electric spark at the\nend of a wire?\n\nIs there a sea of this conscious force which laps the shores of the\nfarthest-flung stars; that finds expression in everything--man and rock,\nmetal and flower, jewel and cloud? Limited in its expression only by the\nlimitations of that which animates, and in essence the same in all. If\nso, then this problem of the life of the Metal People ceased to be a\nproblem; was answered!\n\nSo thinking I became aware of increasing light; strode past Yuruk to\nthe door and peeped out. Dawn was paling the sky. I stooped over Drake,\nshook him. On the instant he was awake, alert.\n\n\"I only need a little sleep, Dick,\" I said. \"When the sun is well up,\ncall me.\"\n\n\"Why, it's dawn,\" he whispered. \"Goodwin, you ought not to have let me\nsleep so long. I feel like a damned pig.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" I said. \"But watch the eunuch closely.\"\n\nI rolled myself up in his warm blanket; sank almost instantly into\ndreamless slumber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. INTO THE PIT\n\nHigh was the sun when I awakened; or so, I supposed, opening my eyes\nupon a flood of daylight. As I lay, lazily, recollection rushed upon me.\n\nIt was no sky into which I was gazing; it was the dome of Norhala's\nelfin home. And Drake had not aroused me. Why? And how long had I slept?\n\nI jumped to my feet, stared about. Ruth nor Drake nor the black eunuch\nwas there!\n\n\"Ruth!\" I shouted. \"Drake!\"\n\nThere was no answer. I ran to the doorway. Peering up into the white\nvault of the heavens I set the time of day as close to seven; I had\nslept then three hours, more or less. Yet short as that time of slumber\nhad been, I felt marvelously refreshed, reenergized; the effect, I was\ncertain, of the extraordinarily tonic qualities of the atmosphere of\nthis place. But where were the others? Where Yuruk?\n\nI heard Ruth's laughter. Some hundred yards to the left, half hidden\nby a screen of flowering shrubs, I saw a small meadow. Within it a\nhalf-dozen little white goats nuzzled around her and Dick. She was\nmilking one of them.\n\nReassured, I drew back into the chamber, knelt over Ventnor. His\ncondition was unchanged. My gaze fell upon the pool that had been\nNorhala's bath. Longingly I looked at it; then satisfying myself\nthat the milking process was not finished, slipped off my clothes and\nsplashed about.\n\nI had just time to get back in my clothes when through the doorway came\nthe pair, each carrying a porcelain pannikin full of milk.\n\nThere was no shadow of fear or horror on her face. It was the old Ruth\nwho stood before me; nor was there effort in the smile she gave me. She\nhad been washed clean in the waters of sleep.\n\n\"Don't worry, Walter,\" she said. \"I know what you're thinking. But\nI'm--ME again.\"\n\n\"Where is Yuruk?\" I turned to Drake bruskly to smother the sob of\nsheer happiness I felt rising in my throat; and at his wink and warning\ngrimace abruptly forebore to press the question.\n\n\"You men pick out the things and I'll get breakfast ready,\" said Ruth.\n\nDrake picked up the teakettle and motioned me before him.\n\n\"About Yuruk,\" he whispered when he had gotten outside. \"I gave him a\nlittle object lesson. Persuaded him to go down the line a bit, showed\nhim my pistol, and then picked off one of Norhala's goats with it. Hated\nto do it, but I knew it would be good for his soul.\n\n\"He gave one screech and fell on his face and groveled. Thought it was\na lightning bolt, I figure; decided I had been stealing Norhala's stuff.\n'Yuruk,' I told him, 'that's what you'll get, and worse, if you lay a\nfinger on that girl inside there.'\"\n\n\"And then what happened?\" I asked.\n\n\"He beat it back there.\" He grinned, pointing toward the forest through\nwhich ran the path the eunuch had shown me. \"Probably hiding back of a\ntree.\"\n\nAs we filled the container at the outer spring, I told him of the\nrevelations and the offer Yuruk had made to me.\n\n\"Whew-w!\" he whistled. \"In the nutcracker, eh? Trouble behind us and\ntrouble in front of us.\"\n\n\"When do we start?\" he asked, as we turned back.\n\n\"Right after we've eaten,\" I answered. \"There's no use putting it off.\nHow do you feel about it?\"\n\n\"Frankly, like the chief guest at a lynching party,\" he said. \"Curious\nbut none too cheerful.\"\n\nNor was I. I was filled with a fever of scientific curiosity. But I was\nnot cheerful--no!\n\n\nWe ministered to Ventnor as well as we could; forcing open his set jaws,\nthrusting a thin rubber tube down past his windpipe into his gullet and\ndropping through it a few ounces of the goat milk. Our own breakfasting\nwas silent enough.\n\nWe could not take Ruth with us upon our journey; that was certain; she\nmust stay here with her brother. She would be safer in Norhala's home\nthan where we were going, of course, and yet to leave her was most\ndistressing. After all, I wondered, was there any need of both of us\ntaking the journey; would not one do just as well?\n\nDrake could stay--\n\n\"No use of putting all our eggs in one basket,\" I broached the subject.\n\"I'll go down by myself while you stay and help Ruth. You can always\nfollow if I don't turn up in a reasonable time.\"\n\nHis indignation at this proposal was matched only by her own.\n\n\"You'll go with him, Dick Drake,\" she cried, \"or I'll never look at or\nspeak to you again!\"\n\n\"Good Lord! Did you think for a minute I wouldn't?\" Pain and wrath\nstruggled on his face. \"We go together or neither of us goes. Ruth will\nbe all right here, Goodwin. The only thing she has any cause to fear is\nYuruk--and he's had his lesson.\n\n\"Besides, she'll have the rifles and her pistols, and she knows how\nto use them. What d'ye mean by making such a proposition as that?\" His\nindignation burst all bounds.\n\nLamely I tried to justify myself.\n\n\"I'll be all right,\" said Ruth. \"I'm not afraid of Yuruk. And none of\nthese Things will hurt me--not after--not after--\" Her eyes fell, her\nlips quivered, then she faced us steadily. \"Don't ask me how I know\nthat,\" she said quietly. \"Believe me, I do know it. I am closer to--them\nthan you two are. And if I choose I can call upon that alien strength\ntheir master gave me. It is for you two that I fear.\"\n\n\"No fear for us,\" Drake burst out hastily. \"We're Norhala's little\nplaythings. We're tabu. Take it from me, Ruth, I'd bet my head there\nisn't one of these Things, great or small, and no matter how many, that\ndoesn't by this time know all about us.\n\n\"We'll probably be received with demonstrations of interest by the\npopulace as welcome guests. Probably we'll find a sign--'Welcome to our\nCity'--hung up over the front gate.\"\n\nShe smiled, a trifle tremulously.\n\n\"We'll come back,\" he said. Suddenly he leaned forward, put his hands on\nher shoulders. \"Do you think there is anything that could keep me from\ncoming back?\" he whispered.\n\nShe trembled, wide eyes searching deep into his.\n\n\"Well,\" I broke in, a bit uncomfortably, \"we'd better be starting.\nI think as Drake does, that we're tabu. Barring accident there's\nno danger. And if I guess right about these Things, accident is\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"As inconceivable as the multiplication table going wrong,\" he laughed,\nstraightening.\n\nAnd so we made ready. Our rifles would be worse than useless, we knew;\nour pistols we decided to carry as Drake put it, \"for comfort.\" Canteens\nfilled with water; a couple of emergency rations, a few instruments,\nincluding a small spectroscope, a selection from the medical kit--all\nthese packed in a little haversack which he threw over his broad\nshoulders.\n\nI pocketed my compact but exceedingly powerful field-glasses. To my\npoignant and everlasting regret my camera had been upon the bolting\npony, and Ventnor had long been out of films for his.\n\nWe were ready for our journey.\n\n\nOur path led straight away, a smooth and dark-gray road whose surface\nresembled cement packed under enormous pressure. It was all of fifty\nfeet wide and now, in daylight, glistened faintly as though overlaid\nwith some vitreous coating. It narrowed abruptly into a wedged way that\nstopped at the threshold of Norhala's door.\n\nDiminishing through the distance, it stretched straight as an arrow\nonward and vanished between perpendicular cliffs which formed the\nfrowning gateway through which the night before we had passed upon the\ncoursing cubes from the pit of the city. Here, as then, a mistiness\nchecked the gaze.\n\nRuth with us, we made a brief inspection of the surroundings of\nNorhala's house. It was set as though in the narrowest portion of\nan hour-glass. The precipitous walls marched inward from the gateway\nforming the lower half of the figure; at the back they swung apart at a\nwider angle.\n\nThis upper part of the hour-glass was filled with a park-like forest. It\nwas closed, perhaps twenty miles away, by a barrier of cliffs.\n\nHow, I wondered, did the path which Yuruk had pointed out to me pierce\nthem? Was it by pass or tunnel; and why was it the armored men had not\nfound and followed it?\n\nThe waist between these two mountain wedges was a valley not more than\na mile wide. Norhala's house stood in its center; and it was like a\ngarden, dotted with flowering and fragrant lilies and here and there a\ntiny green meadow. The great globe of blue that was Norhala's dwelling\nseemed less to rest upon the ground than to emerge from it; as though\nits basic curvatures were hidden in the earth.\n\nWhat was its substance I could not tell. It was as though built of the\nlacquer of the gems whose colors it held. And beautiful, wondrously,\nincredibly beautiful it was--an immense bubble of froth of molten\nsapphires and turquoises.\n\nWe had not time to study its beauties. A few last instructions to Ruth,\nand we set forth down the gray road. Hardly had we taken a few steps\nwhen there came a faint cry from her.\n\n\"Dick! Dick--come here!\"\n\nHe sprang to her, caught her hands in his. For a moment, half frightened\nit seemed, she considered him.\n\n\"Dick,\" I heard her whisper. \"Dick--come back safe to me!\"\n\nI saw his arms close about her, hers tighten around his neck; black hair\ntouched the silken brown curls, their lips met, clung. I turned away.\n\nIn a little time he joined me; head down, silent, he strode along beside\nme, utterly dejected.\n\nA hundred more yards and we turned. Ruth was still standing on the\nthreshold of the house of mystery, watching us. She waved her hands,\nflitted in, was hidden from us. And Drake still silent, we pushed on.\n\nThe walls of the gateway were close. The sparse vegetation along the\nbase of the cliffs had ceased; the roadway itself had merged into the\nsmooth, bare floor of the canyon. From vertical edge to vertical edge\nof the rocky portal stretched a curtain of shimmering mist. As we drew\nnearer we saw that this was motionless, and less like vapor of water\nthan vapor of light; it streamed in oddly fixed lines like atoms of\ncrystals in a still solution. Drake thrust an arm within it, waved it;\nthe mist did not move. It seemed instead to interpenetrate the arm--as\nthough bone and flesh were spectral, without power to dislodge the\nshining particles from position.\n\nWe passed within it--side by side.\n\nInstantly I knew that whatever these veils were, they were not moisture.\nThe air we breathed was dry, electric. I was sensible of a decided\nstimulation, a pleasant tingling along every nerve, a gaiety almost\nlight-headed. We could see each other quite plainly, the rocky floor on\nwhich we trod as well. Within this vapor of light there was no ghost\nof sound; it was utterly empty of it. I saw Drake turn to me, his mouth\nopen in a laugh, his lips move in speech--and although he bent close to\nmy ear, I heard nothing. He frowned, puzzled, and walked on.\n\n\nAbruptly we stepped into an opening, a pocket of clear air. Our ears\nwere filled with a high, shrill humming as unpleasantly vibrant as the\nshriek of a sand blast. Six feet to our right was the edge of the\nledge on which we stood; beyond it was a sheer drop into space. A shaft\npiercing down into the void and walled with the mists.\n\nBut it was not that shaft that made us clutch each other. No! It was\nthat through it uprose a colossal column of the cubes. It stood a\nhundred feet from us. Its top was another hundred feet above the level\nof our ledge and its length vanished in the depths.\n\nAnd its head was a gigantic spinning wheel, yards in thickness, tapering\nat its point of contact with the cliff wall into a diameter half that\nof the side closest the column, gleaming with flashes of green flame and\ngrinding with tremendous speed at the face of the rock.\n\nOver it, attached to the cliff, was a great vizored hood of some pale\nyellow metal, and it was this shelter that cutting off the vaporous\nlight like an enormous umbrella made the pocket of clarity in which we\nstood, the shaft up which sprang the pillar.\n\nAll along the length of that column as far as we could see the\nmyriad tiny eyes of the Metal People shone out upon us, not twinkling\nmischievously, but--grotesque as this may seem, I cannot help it--wide\nwith surprise.\n\nOnly an instant longer did the great wheel spin. I saw the screaming\nrock melting beneath it, dropping like lava. Then, as though it had\nreceived some message, abruptly its motion now ceased.\n\nIt tilted; looked down upon us!\n\nI noted that its grinding surface was studded thickly with the smaller\npyramids and that the tips of these were each capped with what seemed\nto be faceted gems gleaming with the same pale yellow radiance as the\nShrine of the Cones.\n\nThe column was bending; the wheel approaching.\n\nDrake seized me by the arm, drew me swiftly back into the mists. We were\nshrouded in their silences. Step by step we went on, peering for\nthe edge of the shelf, feeling in fancy that prodigious wheeled face\nstealing upon us; afraid to look behind lest in looking we might step\ntoo close to the unseen verge.\n\nYard after yard we slowly covered. Suddenly the vapors thinned; we\npassed out of them--\n\nA chaos of sound beat about us. The clanging of a million anvils; the\nclamor of a million forges; the crashing of a hundred years of thunder;\nthe roarings of a thousand hurricanes. The prodigious bellowings of the\nPit beating against us now as they had when we had flown down the long\nramp into the depths of the Sea of Light.\n\nInstinct with unthinkable power was that clamor; the very voice of\nForce. Stunned, nay BLINDED, by it, we covered ears and eyes.\n\nAs before, the clangor died, leaving in its wake a bewildered silence.\nThen that silence began to throb with a vast humming, and through that\nhumming rang a murmur as that of a river of diamonds.\n\nWe opened our eyes, felt awe grip our throats as though a hand had\nclutched them.\n\nDifficult, difficult almost beyond thought is it for me now to essay to\ndraw in words the scene before us then. For although I can set down what\nit was we saw, I nor any man can transmute into phrases its essence, its\nspirit, the intangible wonder that was its synthesis--the appallingly\nbeautiful, soul-shaking strangeness of it, its grandeur, its fantasy,\nand its alien terror.\n\nThe Domain of the Metal Monster--it was filled like a chalice with Its\nwill; was the visible expression of that will.\n\nWe stood at the very rim of a wide ledge. We looked down into an immense\npit, shaped into a perfect oval, thirty miles in length I judged, and\nhalf that as wide, and rimmed with colossal precipices. We were at the\nupper end of this deep valley and on the tip of its axis; I mean that\nit stretched longitudinally before us along the line of greatest length.\nFive hundred feet below was the pit's floor. Gone were the clouds of\nlight that had obscured it the night before; the air crystal clear;\nevery detail standing out with stereoscopic sharpness.\n\nFirst the eyes rested upon a broad band of fluorescent amethyst, ringing\nthe entire rocky wall. It girdled the cliffs at a height of ten thousand\nfeet, and from this flaming zone, as though it clutched them, fell the\ncurtains of sparkling mist, the enigmatic, sound-slaying vapors.\n\nBut now I saw that all of these veils were not motionless like those\nthrough which we had just passed. To the northwest they were pulsing\nlike the aurora, and like the aurora they were shot through with swift\niridescences, spectrums, polychromatic gleamings. And always these were\nordered, geometric--like immense and flitting prismatic crystals flying\nswiftly to the very edges of the veils, then darting as swiftly back.\n\nFrom zone and veils the gaze leaped to the incredible City towering not\ntwo miles away from us.\n\nBlue black, shining, sharply cut as though from polished steel, it\nreared full five thousand feet on high!\n\nHow great it was I could not tell, for the height of its precipitous\nwalls barred the vision. The frowning facade turned toward us was, I\nestimated, five miles in length. Its colossal scarp struck the eyes\nlike a blow; its shadow, falling upon us, checked the heart. It was\noverpowering--dreadful as that midnight city of Dis that Dante saw\nrising up from another pit.\n\nIt was a metal city, mountainous.\n\nFeatureless, smooth, the immense wall of it heaved heavenward. It should\nhave been blind, that vast oblong face--but it was not blind. From it\nradiated alertness, vigilance. It seemed to gaze toward us as though\nevery foot were manned with sentinels; guardians invisible to the eyes\nwhose concentration of watchfulness was caught by some subtle hidden\nsense higher than sight.\n\nIt was a metal city, mountainous and--AWARE.\n\nAbout its base were huge openings. Through and around these portals\nswirled hordes of the Metal People; in units and in combinations coming\nand going, streaming in and out, forming as they came and went patterns\nabout the openings like the fretted spume of great breakers surging\ninto, retreating from, ocean-bitten gaps in some iron-bound coast.\n\nFrom the immensity of the City the eyes dropped back to the Pit in which\nit lay. Its floor was plaquelike, a great plane smooth as though turned\nby potter's wheel, broken by no mound nor hillock, slope nor terrace;\nlevel, horizontal, flawlessly flat. On it was no green living thing--no\ntree nor bush, meadow nor covert.\n\nIt was alive with movement. A ferment that was as purposeful as it was\nmechanical, a ferment symmetrical, geometrical, supremely ordered--\n\nThe surging of the Metal Hordes.\n\nThere they moved beneath us, these enigmatic beings, in a countless\nhost. They marched and countermarched in battalions, in regiments, in\narmies. Far to the south I glimpsed a company of colossal shapes like\nmobile, castellated and pyramidal mounts. They were circling, weaving\nabout each other with incredible rapidity--like scores of great pyramids\ncrowned with gigantic turrets and dancing. From these turrets came vivid\nflashes, lightning bright--on their wake the rolling echoes of faraway\nthunder.\n\nOut of the north sped a squadron of obelisks from whose tops flamed\nand flared the immense spinning wheels, appearing at this distance like\nfiery whirling disks.\n\nUp from their setting the Metal People lifted themselves in a thousand\nincredible shapes, shapes squared and globed and spiked and shifting\nswiftly into other thousands as incredible. I saw a mass of them draw\nthemselves up into the likeness of a tent skyscraper high; hang so for\nan instant, then writhe into a monstrous chimera of a dozen towering\nlegs that strode away like a gigantic headless and bodiless tarantula in\nsteps two hundred feet long. I watched mile-long lines of them shape and\nreshape into circles, into interlaced lozenges and pentagons--then lift\nin great columns and shoot through the air in unimaginable barrage.\n\nThrough all this incessant movement I sensed plainly purpose, knew\nthat it was definite activity toward a definite end, caught the clear\nsuggestion of drill, of maneuver.\n\nAnd when the shiftings of the Metal Hordes permitted we saw that all\nthe flat floor of the valley was stripped and checkered, stippled and\ntessellated with every color, patterned with enormous lozenges and\nsquares, rhomboids and parallelograms, pentagons and hexagons and\ndiamonds, lunettes, circles and spirals; harlequined yet harmonious;\ninstinct with a grotesque suggestion of a super-Futurism.\n\nBut always this patterning was ordered, always COHERENT. As though\nit were a page on which was spelled some untranslatable other world\nmessage.\n\nFourth Dimensional revelations by some Euclidean deity! Commandments\ntraced by some mathematical God!\n\nLooping across the vale, emerging from the sparkling folds of the\nsouthernmost curtainings and vanishing into the gleaming veils of the\neasternmost, ran a broad ribbon of pale-green jade; not straightly but\nwith manifold convolutions and flourishes. It was like a sentence in\nArabic.\n\nIt was margined with sapphire blue. All along its twisting course two\nbroad bands of jet margined the cerulean shore. It was spanned by scores\nof flashing crystal arches. Nor were these bridges--even from that\ndistance I knew they were no bridges. From them came the crystalline\nmurmurings.\n\nJade? This stream jade? If so then it must be in truth molten, for I\ncaught its swift and polished rushing! It was no jade. It was in truth a\nriver; a river running like a writing across a patterned plane.\n\nI looked upward--up to the circling peaks. They were a stupendous\ncoronet thrusting miles deep into the dazzling sky. I raised my glasses,\nswept them. In color they were an immense and variegated flower with\ncountless multiform petals of stone; in outline they were a ring of\nfortresses built by fantastic unknown Gods.\n\nUp they thrust--domed and arched, spired and horned, pyramided, fanged\nand needled. Here were palisades of burning orange with barbicans of\nincandescent bronze; there aiguilles of azure rising from bastions of\ncinnabar red; turrets of royal purple, obelisks of indigo; titanic forts\nwhose walls were splashed with vermilion, with citron yellows and with\nrust of rubies; watch towers of flaming scarlet.\n\nScattered among them were the flashing emeralds of the glaciers and the\nimmense pallid baroques of the snow fields.\n\nLike a diadem the summits ringed the Pit. Below them ran the ring of\nflashing amethyst with its aural mists. Between them lay the vast and\npatterned flat covered with still symbol and inexplicable movement.\nUnder their summits brooded the blue black, metallic mass of the Seeing\nCity.\n\nWithin circling walls, over plain and from the City hovered a cosmic\nspirit not to be understood by man. Like an emanation of stars and\nspace, it was yet gem fine and gem hard, crystalline and metallic,\nlapidescent and--\n\nConscious!\n\nDown from the ledge where we stood fell a steep ramp, similar to that by\nwhich, in the darkness, we had descended. It dropped at an angle of at\nleast forty-five degrees; its surface was smooth and polished.\n\nThrough the mists at our back stole a shining block. It paused, seemed\nto perk itself; spun so that in turn each of its six faces took us in.\n\nI felt myself lifted upon it by multitudes of little invisible hands;\nsaw Drake whirling up beside me. I moved toward him--through the force\nthat held us. A block swept away from the ledge, swayed for a moment.\nUnder us, as though we were floating in air, the Pit lay stretched.\nThere was a rapid readjustment, a shifting of our two selves upon\nanother surface. I looked down upon a tremendous, slender pillar of the\ncubes, dropping below, five hundred feet to the valley's floor a column\nof which the block that held us was the top.\n\nGone was the whirling wheel that had crowned it, but I knew this for the\nGrinding Thing from which we had fled; the questing block had been its\nscout. As though curious to know more of us, the Shape had sought us out\nthrough the mists, its messenger had caught us, delivered us to it.\n\nThe pillar leaned over--bent like that shining pillar that had bridged\nfor us, at Norhala's commands, the abyss. The floor of the valley arose\nto meet us. Further and further leaned the pillar. Again there was a\nrapid shifting of us to another surface of the crowning cube. Fast now\nswept up toward us the valley floor. A dizziness clouded my sight. There\nwas a little shock, a rolling over the Thing that had held us--\n\nWe stood upon the floor of the Pit.\n\nAnd breaking from the immense and prostrate shaft on whose top we had\nridden downward came score upon score of the cubes. They broke from it,\ndisintegrating it; circled about us, curiously, interestedly, twinkling\nat us from their deep sparkling points of eyes.\n\nHelplessly we gazed at those who circled around us. Then suddenly I felt\nmyself lifted once more, was tossed to the surface of the nearest block.\nUpon it I spun while the tiny eyes searched me. Then like a human ball\nit tossed me to another. I caught a glimpse of Drake's tall figure\ndrifting through the air.\n\nThe play became more rapid, breathtaking. It was play; I recognized\nthat. But it was perilous play for us. I felt myself as fragile as a\ndoll of glass in the hands of careless children.\n\nI was tossed to a waiting cube. On the ground, not ten feet from me,\nwas Drake, swaying dizzily. Suddenly the cube that held me tightened its\ngrip; tightened it so that it drew me irresistibly flat down upon its\nsurface. Before I dropped, Drake's body leaped toward me as though drawn\nby a lasso. He fell at my side.\n\nThen pursued by scores of the Things and like some mischievous boy\nbearing off the spoils, the block that held us raced away, straight for\nan open portal. A blaze of incandescent blue flame blinded me; again\nas the dazzlement faded I saw Drake beside me--a skeleton form. Swiftly\nflesh melted back upon him, clothed him.\n\nThe cube stopped, abruptly; the hosts of little unseen hands raised\nus, slid us gently over its edge, set us upright beside it. And it sped\naway.\n\nAll about us stretched another of those vast halls in which on high\nburned the pale-gilt suns. Between its colossal columns streamed\nthousands of the Metal Folk; no longer hurriedly, but quietly,\ndeliberately, sedately.\n\nWe were within the City--even as Ventnor had commanded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. THE CITY THAT WAS ALIVE\n\nClose beside us was one of the cyclopean columns. We crept to it;\ncrouched at its base opposite the drift of the Metal People; strove,\nhuddled there, to regain our shaken poise. Like bagatelles we felt in\nthat tremendous place, the weird luminaries gleaming above like garlands\nof frozen suns, the enigmatic hosts of animate cubes and spheres and\npyramids trooping past.\n\nThey ranged in size from shapes yard-high to giants of thirty feet or\nmore. They paid no heed to us, did not stop; streaming on, engrossed in\nwhatever mysterious business was summoning them. And after a time their\nnumbers lessened; thinned down to widely separate groups, to stragglers;\nthen ceased. The hall was empty of them.\n\nAs far as the eye could reach the columned spaces stretched. I was\nconscious once more of that unusual flow of energy through every vein\nand nerve.\n\n\"Follow the crowd!\" said Drake. \"Do you feel just full of pep and\nginger, by the way?\"\n\n\"I am aware of the most extraordinary vigor,\" I answered.\n\n\"Some weird joint,\" he mused, looking about him. \"Wonder if they have\nany windows? This whole place looked solid to me--what I could see of\nit. Wonder if we'll get up against it for air? These Things don't need\nit, that's sure. Wonder--\"\n\nHe broke off staring fascinatedly at the pillar behind us.\n\n\"Look here, Goodwin!\" There was a tremor in his voice. \"What do you make\nof THIS?\"\n\nI followed his pointing finger; looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"The eyes!\" he said impatiently. \"Don't you see them? The eyes in the\ncolumn!\"\n\nAnd now I saw them. The pillar was a pale metallic blue, in color a\ntrifle darker than the Metal Folk. All within it were the myriads of\ntiny crystalline points that we had grown to know were the receptors\nof some strange sense of sight. But they did not sparkle as did those\nothers; they were dull, lifeless. I touched the surface. It was smooth,\ncool--with none of that subtle, warm vitality that pulsed through all\nthe Things with which I had come in contact. I shook my head, realizing\nas I did so what a shock the incredible possibility he had suggested had\ngiven me.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"There is a resemblance, yes. But there is no force about\nthis--stuff; no life. Besides, such a thing is utterly incredible.\"\n\n\"They might be--dormant,\" he suggested stubbornly. \"Can you see any mark\nof their joining--if they ARE the cubes?\"\n\nTogether we scanned the pillar minutely. The faces seemed unbroken,\ncontinuous; there was no trace of those thin and shining lines that\nmarked the juncture of the cubes when they had clicked together to form\nthe bridge of the abyss or that had gleamed, crosslike, upon the back of\nthe combined four upon which we had followed Norhala.\n\n\"It's a sheer impossibility. It's madness to think such a thing, Drake!\"\nI exclaimed, and wondered at my own vehemence of denial.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he shook his head doubtfully. \"Maybe--but--well--let's be on\nour way.\"\n\nWe strode on, following the direction the Metal Folk had gone. Clearly\nDrake was still doubtful; at each pillar he hesitated, scanning it\nclosely with troubled eyes.\n\nBut I, having determinedly dismissed the idea, was more interested\nin the fantastic lights that flooded this columned hall with their\nbuttercup radiance. They were still and unwinking; not disks, I could\nsee now, but globes. Great and small, they floated motionless, their\nrays extending rigidly and as still as the orb that shed them.\n\nYet rigid as they were there was nothing about either rays or orbs that\nsuggested either hardness or the metallic. They were vaporous, soft as\nSt. Elmo's fire, the witch lights that cling at times to the spars of\nships, weird gleaming visitors from the invisible ocean of atmospheric\nelectricity.\n\nWhen they disappeared, as they did frequently, it was instantaneously,\ncompletely, with a disconcerting sleight-of-hand finality. I noted,\nthough, that when they did vanish, immediately close to where they\nhad been other orbs swam forth with that same astonishing abruptness;\nsometimes only one, larger it might be than that which had gone;\nsometimes a cluster of smaller globes, their frozen, crocused rays\nimpinging.\n\nWhat could they be, I wondered--how fixed, and what the source of\ntheir light? Products of electro-magnetic currents and born of the\ninterpenetration of such streams flowing above us? Such a theory might\naccount for their disappearance, and reappearance, shiftings of the\nflows that changed the light producing points of contact. Wireless\nlights? If so here was an idea that human science might elaborate if\never we returned to--\n\n\"Now which way?\" Drake broke in upon my musing. The hall had ended. We\nstood before a blank wall vanishing into the soft mists hiding the roof\nof the chamber.\n\n\"I thought we had been going along the way They went,\" I said in\namazement.\n\n\"So did I,\" he answered. \"We must have circled. They never went through\nTHAT unless--unless--\" He hesitated.\n\n\"Unless what?\" I asked sharply.\n\n\"Unless it opened and let them through,\" he said. \"Have you forgotten\nthose great ovals--like cat's eyes that opened in the outer walls?\" he\nadded quietly.\n\nI HAD forgotten. I looked again at the wall. Certainly it was smooth,\nlineless. In one unbroken, shining surface it rose, a facade of polished\nmetal. Within it the deep set points of light were duller even than they\nhad been in the pillars; almost indeed indistinguishable.\n\n\"Go on to the left,\" I said none too patiently. \"And get that absurd\nnotion out of your head.\"\n\n\"All right.\" He flushed. \"But you don't think I'm afraid, do you?\"\n\n\"If what you're thinking were true, you'd have a right to be,\" I replied\ntartly. \"And I want to tell you I'D be afraid. Damned afraid.\"\n\nFor perhaps two hundred paces we skirted the base of the wall. We came\nabruptly to an opening, an oblong passageway fully fifty foot wide by\ntwice as high. At its entrance the mellow, saffron light was cut off as\nthough by an invisible screen. The tunnel itself was filled with a dim\ngrayish blue luster. For an instant we contemplated it.\n\n\"I wouldn't care to be caught in there by any rush,\" I hesitated.\n\n\"There's not much good in thinking of that now,\" said Drake, grimly.\n\"A few chances more or less in a joint of this kind is nothing between\nfriends, Goodwin; take it from me. Come on.\"\n\nWe entered. Walls, floor and roof were composed of the same substance as\nthe great pillars, the wall of the outer chamber; filled like them with\ndimmed replicas of the twinkling eye points.\n\n\"Odd that all the places in here are square,\" muttered Drake. \"They\ndon't seem to have used any spherical or pyramidal ideas in their\nbuilding--if it is a building.\"\n\nIt was true. All was mathematically straight up and down and across. It\nwas strange--still we had seen little as yet.\n\nThere was a warmth about this passageway we trod; a difference in the\nair of it. The warmth grew, a dry and baking heat; but stimulative\nrather than oppressive. I touched the walls; the warmth did not come\nfrom them. And there was no wind. Yet as we went on the heat increased.\n\nThe passageway turned at a right angle, continuing in a corridor\nhalf its former dimensions. Far away shone a high bar of pale yellow\nradiance, rising like a pillar of light from floor to roof. Toward it,\nperforce, we trudged. Its brilliancy grew greater.\n\nA few paces away from it we stopped. The yellow luminescence streamed\nthrough a slit not more than a foot wide in the wall. We were in a\ncul-de-sac for the opening was not wide enough for either Drake or me\nto push through. Through it with the light gushed the curious heat\nenveloping us.\n\nDrake walked to the opening, peered through. I joined him.\n\nAt first all that I could see was a space filled with the saffron\nlambency. Then I saw that this was splashed with tiny flashes of the\njewel fires; little lances and javelin thrusts of burning emeralds and\nrubies; darting gem hard flames rose scarlet and pale sapphire; quick\nflares of violet.\n\nInto my sight through the irised, crocus mist swam the radiant body of\nNorhala!\n\nShe stood naked, clad only in the veils of her hair that glowed now\nlike spun silk of molten copper, her strange eyes wide and smiling, the\ngalaxies of tiny stars sparkling through their gray depths.\n\nAnd all about her swirled a countless host of the Little Things!\n\nFrom them came the gem fires piercing the aureate mists. They played\nand frolicked about her in scores of swiftly forming, swiftly changing,\ngoblin shapes. They circled her feet in shining, elfin rings; then\nopening into flaming disks and stars, shot up and spun about the white\nmiracle of her body in great girdles of multi-colored living fires.\nMingled with disk and star were tiny crosses gleaming with sullen, deep\ncrimsons and smoky orange.\n\nA flash of blue incandescence and a slender pillared shape leaped from\nthe floor; became a coronet, a whirling, flashing halo toward which\nstreamed up the flaming tendrilings of her tresses. Other halos circled\nher arms and breasts; they spun like bracelets about the outstretched\narms.\n\nThen like a swiftly rushing wave a host of the Little Things thrust\nthemselves up, covered her, hid her in a coruscating cloud.\n\nI saw an exquisite arm thrust itself from their clinging, wave gaily;\nsaw her glorious head emerge from the incredible, the seething draperies\nof living jewels. I heard her laughter, sweet and golden and far away.\n\nGoddess of the Inexplicable! Madonna of the Metal Babes!\n\nThe Nursery of the Metal People!\n\nNorhala was gone, blotted out from our sight! Gone too were the bar of\nlight and the chamber into which we had been peering. We stared at a\nsmooth, blank wall. With that same ensorcelled swiftness the wall had\nclosed even as we had stared through it; closed so quickly that we had\nnot seen its motion.\n\nI gripped Drake; shrank with him into the farthest corner--for on the\nother side of us the wall was opening. First it was only a crack; then\nrapidly it widened. There stretched another passageway, luminous and\nlong; far down it we glimpsed movement. Closer that movement came,\ngrew plainer. Out of the mistily luminous distances, three abreast and\nfilling the corridor from side to side, raced upon us a company of the\ngreat spheres!\n\nBack we cowered from their approach--back and back; arms outstretched,\npressing against the barrier, flattening ourselves against the shock of\nthe destroying impact menacing.\n\n\"It's all up,\" muttered Drake. \"No place to run. They're bound to smash\nus. Stick close, Doc. Get back to Ruth. Maybe I can stop them!\"\n\nBefore I could check him, he had leaped straight in the path of the\nrushing globes, now a scant twoscore yards away.\n\nThe globes stopped--halted a few feet from him. They seemed to\ncontemplate us, astonished. They turned upon themselves, as though\nconsulting. Slowly they advanced. We were pushed forward and lifted\ngently. Then as we hung suspended, held by that force which always I can\nliken only to myriads of tiny invisible hands, the shining arcs of their\nbacks undulated beneath us.\n\nTheir files swung around the corner and marched down the passage by\nwhich we had come from the immense hall. And when the last rank had\npassed from under us we were dropped softly to our feet; stood swaying\nin their wake.\n\nA curious frenzy of helpless indignation shook me, a rage of humiliation\nobscuring all gratitude I should have felt for our escape. Drake's eyes\nblazed wrath.\n\n\"The insolent devils!\" He raised clenched fists. \"The insolent,\ndomineering devils!\"\n\nWe stared after them.\n\nWas the passage growing narrower--closing? Even as I gazed I saw it\nshrink; saw its walls slide silently toward each other. I pushed Drake\ninto the newly opened way and sprang after him.\n\nBehind us was an unbroken wall covering all that space in which but a\nmoment before we had stood!\n\nIs it to be wondered that a panic seized us; that we began to run\ncrazily down the alley that still lay open before us, casting over\nour shoulders quick, fearful glances to see whether that inexorable,\ndreadful closing was continuing, threatening to crush us between these\nwalls like flies in a vise of steel?\n\nBut they did not close. Unbroken, silent, the way stretched before us\nand behind us. At last, gasping, avoiding each other's gaze, we paused.\n\nAnd at that very moment of pause a deeper tremor shook me, a trembling\nof the very foundations of life, the shuddering of one who faces the\ninconceivable knowing at last that the inconceivable--IS.\n\nFor, abruptly, walls and floor and roof broke forth into countless\ntwinklings!\n\nAs though a film had been withdrawn from them, as though they had\nawakened from slumber, myriads of little points of light shone forth\nupon us from the pale-blue surfaces--lights that considered us, measured\nus--mocked us.\n\nThe little points of living light that were the eyes of the Metal\nPeople!\n\nThis was no corridor cut through inert matter by mechanic art; its\nopening had been caused by no hidden mechanisms! It was a living\nThing--walled and floored and roofed by the living bodies--of the Metal\nPeople themselves.\n\nIts opening, as had been the closing of that other passage, was the\nconscious, coordinate and voluntary action of the Things that formed\nthese mighty walls.\n\nAn action that obeyed, was directed by, the incredibly gigantic,\ncommunistic will which, like the spirit of the hive, the soul of the\nformicary, animated every unit of them.\n\nA greater realization swept us. If THIS were true, then those pillars in\nthe vast hall, its towering walls--all this City was one living Thing!\n\nBuilt of the animate bodies of countless millions! Tons upon countless\ntons of them shaping a gigantic pile of which every atom was sentient,\nmobile--intelligent!\n\nA Metal Monster!\n\nNow I knew why it was that its frowning facade had seemed to watch us\nArgus-eyed as the Things had tossed us toward it. It HAD watched us!\n\nThat flood of watchfulness pulsing about us had been actual\nconcentration of regard of untold billions of tiny eyes of the living\nblock which formed the City's cliff.\n\nA City that Saw! A City that was Alive!\n\nNo secret mechanism then--back darted my mind to that first terror--had\nclosed the wall, shutting from our sight Norhala at play with the Little\nThings. None had opened the way for, had closed the way behind, the\ncoursing spheres. It had been done by the conscious action of the\nconscious Things of whose living bodies was built this whole tremendous\nthinking pile!\n\n\nI think that for a moment we both went a little mad as that staggering\ntruth came to us. I know we started to run once more, side by side,\ngripping like frightened children each other's hands. Then Drake\nstopped.\n\n\"By all the HELL of this place,\" he said, solemnly, \"I'll run no more.\nAfter all--we're men. If they kill us, they kill us. But by the God who\nmade me I'll run from them no more. I'll die standing.\"\n\nHis courage steadied me. Defiantly we marched on. Up from below us, down\nfrom the roof, out from the walls of our way the hosts of eyes gleamed\nand twinkled upon us.\n\n\"Who could have believed it?\" he muttered, half to himself. \"A living\ncity of them! A living nest of them; a prodigious living nest of metal!\"\n\n\"A nest?\" I caught the word. What did it suggest? That was it--the nest\nof the army ants, the city of the army ants, that Beebe had studied in\nthe South American jungles and once described to me. After all, was this\nmore wonderful, more unbelievable than that--the city of ants which was\nformed by their living bodies precisely as this was of the bodies of the\nCubes?\n\nHow had Beebe * phrased it--\"the home, the nest, the hearth, the nursery,\nthe bridal suite, the kitchen, the bed and board of the army ants.\"\nBuilt of and occupied by those blind and deaf and savage little insects\nwhich by the guidance of smell alone carried on the most intricate\noperations, the most complex activities. Nothing here was stranger than\nthat, I reflected--if once one could rid the mind of the paralyzing\ninfluence of the shapes of the Metal Things. Whence came the stimuli\nthat moved THEM, the stimuli to which THEY reacted?\n\n     * William Beebe, Atlantic Monthly, October, 1919.\n\nWell then--whence and how came the orders to which the ANTS responded;\nthat bade them open THIS corridor in their nest, close THAT, form this\nchamber, fill that one? Was one more mysterious than the other?\n\nBreaking into my current of thoughts came consciousness that I was\nmoving with increased speed; that my body was fast growing lighter.\n\nSimultaneously with this recognition I felt myself lifted from the\nfloor of the corridor and levitated with considerable rapidity forward;\nlooking down I saw that floor several feet below me. Drake's arm wound\nitself around my shoulder.\n\n\"Closing up behind us,\" he muttered. \"They're putting us--out.\"\n\nIt was, indeed, as though the passageway had wearied of our deliberate\nprogress. Had decided to--give us a lift. Rearward it was shutting. I\nnoted with interest how accurately this motion kept pace with our own\nspeed, and how fluidly the walls seemed to run together.\n\nOur movement became accelerated. It was as though we floated buoyantly,\nweightless, upon some swift stream. The sensation was curiously\npleasant, languorous--what was that word Ruth had used?--ELEMENTAL--and\nfree. The supporting force seemed to flow equally from walls and\nfloor; to reach down to us from the roof. It was slumberously even, and\neffortless. I saw that in advance of us the living corridor was opening\neven as behind us it was closing.\n\nAll around us the little eye points twinkled and--laughed.\n\nThere was no danger here--there could be none. Deeper and deeper dropped\nmy mind into the depths of that alien tranquillity. Faster and faster we\nfloated--onward.\n\nAbruptly, ahead of us shone a blaze of daylight. We passed into it. The\nforce holding us withdrew its grip; I felt solidity beneath my feet;\nstood and leaned back against a smooth wall.\n\nThe corridor had ended and--had shut us out from itself.\n\n\"Bounced!\" exclaimed Drake.\n\nAnd incongruous, flippant, colloquial as was that word, I know none that\nwould better describe my own feelings.\n\nWe were BOUNCED out upon a turret jutting from the barrier. And before\nus lay spread the most amazing, the most extraordinary fantastic scene\nupon which, I think, the vision of man has rested since the advent of\ntime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. VAMPIRES OF THE SUN\n\nIt was a crater; a half mile on high and all of two thousand feet across\nran the circular lip of its vast rim. Above it was a circle of white and\nglaring sky in whose center flamed the sun.\n\nAnd instantly, before my vision could grasp a tithe of that panorama, I\nknew that this place was the very heart of the City; its vital ganglion;\nits soul.\n\nAround the crater lip were poised thousands of concave disks, vernal\ngreen, enormous. They were like a border of gigantic, upthrust shields;\nand within each, emblazoned like a shield's device, was a blinding\nflower of flame--the reflected, dilated face of the sun. Below this\ndiadem hung, pendent, clusters of other disks, swarmed like the globular\nhiving of the constellation Hercules' captured stars. And each of these\nprisoned the image of our sun.\n\nA hundred feet below us was the crater floor.\n\nUp from it thrust a mountainous forest of the pallidly radiant cones;\nbristling; prodigious. Tier upon tier, thicket upon thicket, phalanx\nupon phalanx they climbed. Up and up, pyramidically, they flung their\nspiked hosts.\n\nThey drew together two thousand feet above us, clustering close about\nthe foot of a single huge spire which thrust itself skyward above them.\nThe crest of this spire was truncated. From its shorn tip radiated\nscores of long and slender spokes holding in place a thousand feet wide\nwheel of wan green disks whose concave surfaces, unlike those smooth\nones girding the crater, were curiously faceted.\n\nThis amazing structure rested upon a myriad-footed base of crystal,\neven as had that other cornute fantasy beside which we had met the great\nDisk. But it was in size to that as--as Leviathan to a minnow. From it\nstreamed the same baffling suggestion of invincible force transmuted\ninto matter; energy coalesced into the tangible; power made concentrate\nin the vestments of substance.\n\nHalf-way between crater lip and floor began the hordes of the Metal\nPeople.\n\nIn colossal animate cheveau-de-frise of hundred-foot girders they thrust\nthemselves out from the curving walls--walls, I knew, as alive as they!\n\nFrom these Brobdignagian beams they swung in ropes and clusters--spheres\nand cubes studded as thickly with the pyramids as ever Titan's mace with\nspikes. Group after bizarre group they dropped; pendulous. Coppices\nof slender columns of thistled globes sprang up to meet the festooned\njoists.\n\nBetween the girders they draped themselves in long, stellated garlands;\ngrouped themselves in innumerable, kaleidoscopic patterns.\n\nThey clicked into place around the golden turret in which we crouched.\n\nIn fantastic arrases they swayed in front of us--now hiding by, now\nrevealing through their quicksilver interweavings the mounts of the\nCones.\n\nAnd steadily those flowing in below added to their multitudes; gliding\nup cable and pillar; building out still further the living girders,\nstringing themselves upon living festoon and living garland, weaving in\namong them, changing their shapes, rewriting their symbols.\n\nThey swung and threaded swiftly, in shifting arabesque, in Gothic\ntraceries, in lace-like fantasies; utterly bizarre, unutterably\nbeautiful--crystalline, geometric always.\n\nAbruptly their movement ceased--so abruptly that the stoppage of all the\nordered turmoil had the quality of appalling silence.\n\nAn unimaginable tapestry bedight with incredible broidery, the Metal\nPeople draped the vast cup.\n\nPillared it as though it were a temple.\n\nGarnished it with their bodies as though it were a shrine.\n\nAcross the floor toward the Cones glided a palely lustrous sphere. In\nshape only a globe like all its kind, yet it was invested with power; it\nradiated power as a star does light; was clothed in unseen garments of\nsupernal force. In its wake drifted two great pyramids; after them ten\nspheres but little smaller than the Shape which led.\n\n\"The Metal Emperor!\" breathed Drake.\n\nOn they swept until they reached the base of the Cones. They paused at\nthe edge of the crystal tabling. They turned.\n\nThere was a flashing as of a meteor bursting. The globe had opened into\nthat splendor of jewel fires before which had floated Norhala and Ruth.\n\nI saw again the luminous ovals of sapphire, studding its golden zone,\nthe mystic rose of pulsing, petal flame, the still core of incandescent\nruby that was the heart of that rose.\n\nStrangely I felt my own heart veer toward this--Thing; bowing before its\nbeauty and its strength; almost worshiping!\n\nA shock of revulsion went through me. I shot a quick, half frightened\nglance at Drake. He was crouching dangerously close to the lip of the\nledge, hands clasped and knuckles white with the intensity of his grip,\neyes rapt, staring--upon the verge of worship even as I had been.\n\n\"Drake!\" I thrust my elbow into his side brutally. \"None of that!\nRemember you're human! Guard yourself, man--guard yourself!\"\n\n\"What?\" he muttered; then, abruptly: \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"I felt it myself,\" I answered: \"For God's sake, Dick--hold fast to\nyourself! Remember Ruth!\"\n\nHe shook his head violently--as though to be rid of some clinging,\ncloying thing.\n\n\"I'll not forget again,\" he said.\n\nHe huddled down once more close to the edge of the shelf; peering over.\nNo one of the Metal People had moved; the silence, the stillness, was\nunbroken.\n\nNow the flanking pyramids shot forth into twin stars, blazing with\nviolet luminescences. And one by one after them the ten lesser spheres\nexpanded into flaming orbs; beautiful they were, but far less glorious\nthan that Disk of whom they were the counselors?--ministers?--what?\n\nStill there was no movement among all the arrased, girdered, pillared\nhosts.\n\nThere came a little wailing; far away it was and far. Nearer it drew.\nWas that a tremor that passed through the crowded crater? A quick pulse\nof--eagerness?\n\n\"Hungry!\" whispered Drake. \"They're HUNGRY!\"\n\n\nCloser was the wailing; again that faint tremor quivered over the place.\nAnd now I caught it--a quick and avid pulsing.\n\n\"Hungry,\" whispered Drake again. \"Like a lot of lions with the keeper\ncoming along with meat.\"\n\nThe wailing was below us. I felt, not a quiver this time, but an\nunmistakable shock pass through the Horde. It throbbed--and passed.\n\nInto the field of our vision, up to the flaming Disk rushed an immense\ncube.\n\nThrice the height of a tall man--as I think I have noted before--when it\nunfolded its radiance was that shape of mingled beauty and power I call\nthe Metal Emperor.\n\nYet this Thing eclipsed it. Black, uncompromising, in some indefinable\nway BRUTAL, its square bulk blotted out the Disk's effulgence; shrouded\nit. And a shadow seemed to fall upon the crater. The violet fires of the\nflanking stars pulsed out--watchfully, threateningly.\n\nFor only an instant the darkening block loomed against the Disk;\nblackened it.\n\nThere came another meteor burst of light. Where the cube had been was\nnow a tremendous, fiery cross--a cross inverted.\n\nIts upper arm arose to twice the length either of its horizontals or\nthe square that was its foot. In its opening it must have turned, for\nits--FACE--was toward us and away from the Cones, its body hid the Disk,\nand almost all the surfaces of the two watchful Stars.\n\nEighty feet at least in height, this cruciform shape stood. It flamed\nand flickered with angry, smoky crimsons and scarlets; with sullen\norange glowings and glitterings of sulphurous yellows. Within its fires\nwere none of those leaping, multicolored glories that were the Metal\nEmperor's; no trace of the pulsing, mystic rose; no shadow of jubilant\nsapphire; no purple royal; no tender, merciful greens nor gracious\nopalescences. Nothing even of the blasting violet of the Stars.\n\nAll angry, smoky reds and ochres the cross blazed forth--and in its\nlurid glowings was something sinister, something real, something cruel,\nsomething--nearer to earth, closer to man.\n\n\"The Keeper of the Cones and the Metal Emperor!\" muttered Drake. \"I\nbegin to get it--yes--I begin to get--Ventnor!\"\n\nOnce more the pulse, the avid throbbing shook the crater. And as swiftly\nin its wake rushed back the stillness, the silence.\n\nThe Keeper turned--I saw its palely lustrous blue metallic back. I drew\nout my little field-glasses, focussed them.\n\nThe Cross slipped sidewise past the Disk, its courtiers, its stellated\nguardians. As it went by they swung about with it; ever facing it.\n\nAnd now at last was clear a thing that had puzzled greatly--the\nmechanism of that opening process by which sphere became oval disk,\npyramid a four-pointed star and--as I had glimpsed in the play of the\nLittle Things about Norhala, could see now so plainly in the Keeper--the\nblocks took this inverted cruciform shape.\n\nThe Metal People were hollow!\n\nHollow metal--boxes!\n\nIn their enclosing sides dwelt all their vitality--their\npowers--themselves!\n\nAnd those sides were--everything that THEY were!\n\nFolded, the oval disk became the sphere; the four points of the star,\nthe square from which those points radiated; shutting became the\npyramid; the six faces of the cubes were when opened the inverted cross.\n\nNor were these flexible, mobile walls massive. They were indeed,\nconsidering the apparent mass of the Metal Folk, most astonishingly\nfragile. Those of the Keeper, despite its eighty feet of height, could\nnot have been more than a yard in thickness. At the edges I thought I\ncould see groovings; noted the same appearances at the outlines of\nthe Stars. Seen sidewise, the body of the Metal Emperor showed as a\nconvexity; its surface smooth, with a suggestion of transparency.\n\nThe Keeper was bending; its oblong upper plane dropping forward as\nthough upon a hinge. Lower and lower this flange bent--in a grotesque,\nterrifying obeisance; a horrible mockery of reverence.\n\nWas this mountain of Cones then actually a shrine--an idol of the Metal\nPeople--their God?\n\nThe oblong that was the upper half of the cruciform Shape extended now\nat right angles to the horizontal arms. It hovered, a rectangle forty\nfeet long, as many feet over the floor at the base of the crystal\npedestal. It bent again, this time from the hinge that held the\noutstretched arms to the base. And now it was a huge truncated cross, a\nT-shaped figure, hovering only twenty feet above the pave.\n\nDown from the Keeper writhed and flicked a tangle of tentacles;\nserpentine, whiplike. Silvery white, they were dyed with the scarlet and\norange flaming of the surface now hidden from my eyes; reflected those\nsullen and angry gleamings. Vermiceous, coiling, they seemed to drop\nfrom every inch of the overhanging planes.\n\nSomething there was beneath them--something like an immense and luminous\ntablet. The tentacles were moving over it--pressing here, thrusting\nthere, turning, pushing, manipulating--\n\n\nA shuddering passed through the crowding cones. I saw the tremor shake\ntheir bristling hosts, oscillate the great spire, set the faceted disks\nquivering.\n\nThe trembling grew; a vibration in every separate cone that became even\nmore rapid. There was a faint, curiously oppressive humming--like the\ndistant echo of a tempest in chaos.\n\nFaster, ever faster grew the vibration. Now the sharp outlines of the\ncones were dissolving.\n\nAnd now they were--gone.\n\nThe mount of the cones had become a mighty pyramid of pale green\nradiance--one tremendous, pallid flame, of which the spire was the\ntongue. Out from the disked wheel at its shorn tip gushed a flood of\nlight--light that gathered itself from the leaping radiance below it.\n\nThe tentacles of the Keeper moved more swiftly over the enigmatic\ntablet; writhing cloudily; confusedly rapid. The faceted disks wavered;\nturned upward; the wheel began to whirl--faster--faster--\n\nUp from that flaming circle, out into the sky leaped a thick, pale green\ncolumn of intensest light.\n\nWith prodigious speed, as compact as water, CONCENTRATE, it\nstruck--straight out toward the face of the sun.\n\nIt thrust up with the speed of light--the speed of light? A thought came\nto me; incredible I believed it even as I reacted to it. My pulse is\nuniformly seventy to the minute. I sought my wrist, found the artery,\nmade allowance for its possible acceleration, began to count.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Drake.\n\n\"Take my glasses,\" I muttered, trying to keep up, while speaking, my\ntally. \"Matches in my pocket. Smoke the lenses. I want to look at sun.\"\n\nWith a look of stupefied amazement which, at another time I would have\nfound laughable, he obeyed.\n\n\"Hold them to my eyes,\" I ordered.\n\nThree minutes had gone by.\n\nThere it was--that for which I sought. Clear through the darkened lenses\nI could see the sun spot, high up on the northern-most limb of the\nsun. An unimaginable cyclone of incandescent gases; an unthinkably huge\ndynamo pouring its floods of electro-magnetism upon all the circling\nplanets; that solar crater which we now know was, when at its maximum,\nall of one hundred and fifty thousand miles across; the great sun spot\nof the summer of 1919--the most enormous ever recorded by astronomical\nscience.\n\nFive minutes had gone by.\n\nCommon sense whispered to me. There was no use keeping my eyes fixed\nto the glasses. Even if that thought were true--even if that pillar\nof radiance were a MESSENGER, an earth-hurled bolt flying to the sun\nthrough atmosphere and outer space with the speed of light, even if it\nwere this stupendous creation of these Things, still between eight and\nnine minutes must elapse before it could reach the orb; and as many\nminutes must go by before the image of whatever its impact might produce\nupon the sun could pass back over the bridge of light spanning the\nninety millions of miles between it and us.\n\nAnd after all did not that hypothesis belong to the utterly impossible?\nEven were it so--what was it that the Metal Monster expected to follow?\nThis radiant shaft, colossal as it was to us, was infinitesimal compared\nto the target at which it was aimed.\n\nWhat possible effect could that spear have upon the solar forces?\n\nAnd yet--and yet--a gnat's bite can drive an elephant mad. And Nature's\nbalance is delicate; and what great happenings may follow the slightest\ndisturbance of her infinitely sensitive, her complex, equilibrium? It\nmight be--it might be--\n\nEight minutes had passed.\n\n\"Take the glasses,\" I bade Drake. \"Look up at the sun spot--the big\none.\"\n\n\"I see it.\" He had obeyed me. \"What of it?\"\n\nNine minutes.\n\nThe shaft, if I were right, had by now touched the sun. What was to\nfollow?\n\n\"I don't get you at all,\" said Drake, and lowered the glasses.\n\nTen minutes.\n\n\"What's happening? Look at the Cones! Look at the Emperor!\" gasped\nDrake.\n\n\nI peered down, then almost forgot to count.\n\nThe pyramidal flame that had been the mount of Cones was shrunken. The\npillar of radiance had not lessened--but the mechanism that was its\nsource had retreated whole yards within the field of its crystal base.\n\nAnd the Metal Emperor! Dulled and faint were his fires, dimmed his\nsplendors; and fainter still were the violet luminescences of the\nwatching Stars, the shimmering livery of his court.\n\nThe Keeper of the Cones! Were not its outstretched planes hovering lower\nand lower over the gleaming tablet; its tentacles moving aimlessly,\nfeebly--wearily?\n\nI had a sense of force being withdrawn from all about me. It was as\nthough all the City were being drained of life--as though vitality were\nbeing sucked from it to feed this pyramid of radiance; drained from it\nto forge the thrusting spear piercing sunward.\n\nThe Metal People seemed to hang limply, inert; the living girders seemed\nto sag; the living columns to bend; to droop and to sway.\n\nTwelve minutes.\n\nWith a nerve-racking crash one of the laden beams fell; dragging down\nwith it others; bending, shattering in its fall a thicket of the\nhorned columns. Behind us the sparkling eyes of the wall were dimmed,\nvacant--dying. Something of that hellish loneliness, that demoniac\ndesire for immolation that had assailed us in the haunted hollow of the\nruins began to creep over me.\n\nThe crowded crater was fainting. The life was going out of the City--its\nmagnetic life, draining into the shaft of green fire.\n\nDuller grew the Metal Emperor's glories.\n\nFourteen minutes.\n\n\"Goodwin,\" cried Drake, \"the life's going out of these Things! Going out\nwith that ray they're shooting.\"\n\nFifteen minutes.\n\nI watched the tentacles of the Keeper grope over the tablet. Abruptly\nthe flaming pyramid darkened--WENT OUT.\n\nThe radiant pillar hurtled upward like a thunder-bolt; vanished in\nspace.\n\nBefore us stood the mount of cones, shrunken to a sixth of its former\nsize.\n\nSixteen minutes.\n\nAll about the crater-lip the ringed shields tilted; thrust themselves\non high, as though behind each was an eager lifting arm. Below them the\nhived clusters of disks changed from globules into wide coronets.\n\nSeventeen minutes.\n\nI dropped my wrist; seized the glasses from Drake; raised them to the\nsun. For a moment I saw nothing--then a tiny spot of white incandescence\nshone forth at the lower edge of the great spot. It grew into a point of\nradiance, dazzling even through the shadowed lenses.\n\nI rubbed my eyes; looked again. It was still there, larger--blazing with\nan ever increasing and intolerable intensity.\n\nI handed the glasses to Drake, silently.\n\n\"I see it!\" he muttered. \"I see it! And THAT did it--that! Goodwin!\"\nThere was panic in his cry. \"Goodwin! The spot! it's widening! It's\nwidening!\"\n\nI snatched the glasses from him. I caught again the dazzling flashing.\nBut whether Drake HAD seen the spot widen, change--to this day I do not\nknow.\n\nTo me it seemed unchanged--and yet--perhaps it was not. It may be that\nunder that finger of force, that spear of light, that wound in the side\nof our sun HAD opened further--\n\nThat the sun had winced!\n\nI do not to this day know. But whether it had or not--still shone the\nintolerably brilliant light. And miracle enough that was for me.\n\nTwenty minutes--subconsciously I had gone on counting--twenty minutes--\n\nAbout the cratered girdle of the upthrust shields a glimmering mistiness\nwas gathering; a translucent mist, beryl pale and beryl clear. In a\nheart-beat it had thickened into a vast and vaporous ring through whose\nswarms of corpuscles the sun's reflected image upon each disk shone\nclear--as though seen through clouds of transparent atoms of aquamarine.\n\nAgain the filaments of the Keeper moved--feebly. As one of the hosts of\ncircling shields shifted downward. Brilliant, ever more brilliant, waxed\nthe fast-thickening mists.\n\nAbruptly, and again as one, the disks began to revolve. From every\nconcave surface, from the surfaces of the huge circlets below them,\nflashed out a stream of green fire--green as the fire of green life\nitself. Corpuscular, spun of uncounted rushing, dazzling ions the great\nrays struck across, impinged upon the thousand-foot wheel that crowned\nthe cones; set it whirling.\n\nOver it I saw form a limpid cloud of the brilliant vapors. Whence came\nthese sparkling nebulosities, these mists of light? It was as though the\nclustered, spinning disks reached into the shadowless air, sucked from\nit some unseen, rhythmic energy and transformed it into this visible,\ncoruscating flood.\n\nFor now it was a flood. Down from the immense wheel came pouring\ncataracts of green fires. They cascaded over the cones; deluged them;\nengulfed them.\n\nBeneath that radiant inundation the cones grew. Perceptibly their volume\nincreased--as though they gorged themselves upon the light. No--it was\nas though the corpuscles flew to them, coalesced and built themselves\ninto the structure.\n\nOut and further out upon the base of crystal they crept. And higher and\nhigher soared their tips, thrusting, ever thrusting upward toward the\nwhirling wheel that fed them.\n\nNow from the Keeper's planes writhed the Keeper's tangle of tentacles,\nuncoiling eagerly, avidly, through the twenty feet of space between\ntheir source and the enigmatic mechanism they manipulated. The crater's\ndisks tilted downward. Into the vast hollow shot their jets of green\nradiance, drenching the Metal Hordes, splashing from the polished walls\nwherever the Metal Hordes had left those living walls exposed.\n\nAll about us was a trembling, an accelerating pulse of life. Colossal,\nrhythmic, ever quicker, ever more powerfully that pulse throbbed--a\nprodigious vibration monstrously alive.\n\n\"Feeding!\" whispered Drake. \"Feeding! Feeding on the sun!\"\n\nFaster danced the radiant beams. The crater was a cauldron of green\nfires through which the conical rays angled and interwove, crossed and\nmingled. And where they mingled, where they crossed, flamed out suddenly\nimmense rayless orbs; palpitant for an instant, then dissolving in\nspiralling, feathery spray of pallid emerald incandescences.\n\nStronger and stronger beat the pulse of returning life.\n\nA jetting stream struck squarely upon the Metal Emperor. Out blazed his\nsplendors--jubilant. His golden zodiac, no longer tarnished and dull,\nran with sun flames; the wondrous rose was a racing, lambent miracle.\n\nUp snapped the Keeper; towered behind him, all flickering scarlets and\nleaping yellows--no longer wrathful or sullen.\n\nThe place dripped radiance; was filling like a chrisom with radiance.\n\nUs, too, the sparkling mists bathed.\n\nI was conscious of a curiously wild exhilaration; a quickening of the\npulse; an abnormally rapid breathing. I stooped to touch Drake; sparks\nleaped from my outstretched fingers, great green sparks that crackled as\nthey impacted upon him. He gave them no heed; but stared with fascinated\neyes upon the crater.\n\nNow from every side broke a tempest of gem fires. From every girder\nand column, from every arras, pendent and looping, burst diamond\nglitterings, ruby luminescences, lanced flames of molten emerald and\nsapphires, flashings of amethyst and opal, meteoric iridescences,\ndazzling spectrums.\n\nThe hollow was a cave of some Aladdin of the Titans ablaze with\nenchanted hoards. It was a place of gems ensorcelled, gems in which\nimprisoned hosts of the Jinns of Light beat sparkling against their\ncrystal walls to escape.\n\nI thrust the fantasies from me. Fantastic enough was this reality--globe\nand pyramid and cube of the Metal People opening wide, bathing in,\ndrinking from the radiant maelstrom that faster and ever faster swirled\nabout them.\n\n\"Feeding!\" It was Drake's awed voice. \"Feeding on the sun!\"\n\nThe circling shields were raising themselves, lifting themselves higher\nabove the crater-lip. Into the crowded cylinder came now only the rays\nfrom the high circlets, the streams from the huge wheel above the still\ngrowing cones.\n\nUp and up the shields rose, but by what mechanism raised I could not\nsee. Their motion ceased; in all their thousands they turned. Over the\nCity's top and out into the oval valley they poured their torrents of\nlight; flooding it, deluging it even as they had this pit that was the\nCity's heart. Feeding, I knew, those other Metal Hordes without.\n\nAnd as though in answer, sweeping down upon us through the circles of\nopen sky, a clamor poured.\n\n\"If we'd but known!\" Drake's voice came to me, thin and unreal through\nthe tumult. \"It's what Ventnor meant! If we had got down there when they\nwere so weak--if we could have handled the Keeper--we could have smashed\nthat plate that works the Cones! We could have killed them!\"\n\n\"There are other Cones,\" I cried back to him.\n\n\"No,\" he shook his head. \"This is the master machine. It's what Ventnor\nmeant when he said to strike through the sun. And we've lost the\nchance--\"\n\nLouder grew the hurricane without; and now within began its mate.\nThrough the mists flashed linked tempests of lightnings. Bolt upon\njavelin bolt, and ever more thickly; lightnings green as the mists\nthemselves; lightning bolts of destroying violets, searing scarlets;\ntearing chains of withering yellows, globes of exploding multicolored\nelectric incandescences.\n\nThe crater was threaded with the lightnings of the Metal People; was\nbroidered with them; was a Pit woven with vast and changing patterns of\nelectric flame.\n\nWhat was it that Drake had said? That if but we could have known we\ncould have destroyed these--Things--Destroyed--Them? Things that could\nthrust their will and power up through ninety million miles of space and\nsuck from the sun the honey of power! Drain it and hive it within these\ngreat mountains of the cones!\n\nDestroy Things that could feed their own life into a machine to draw\nback from the sun a greater life--Things that could forge of their\nstrength a spear which, piercing the side of the sun, sent gushing back\nupon them a tenfold, nay, a thousandfold strength!\n\nDestroy this City that was one vast and living dynamo feeding upon the\nmagnetic life of earth and sun!\n\nThe clamor had grown stupendous, destroying--like armored Gods roaring\nat sword play in a hundred Valhallas; like the war drums of battling\nuniverse; like the smitings of warring suns.\n\nAnd all the City was throbbing, beating with a gigantic pulse of\nlife--was fed and drunken with life. I felt that pulsing become my own;\nI echoed to it; throbbed in unison. I saw Drake outlined in flame; that\naround me a radiant nimbus was growing.\n\nI thought I saw Norhala floating, clothed in shouting, flailing fires. I\nstrove to call out to her. By me slipped the body of Drake; lay flaming\nat my feet upon the narrow ledge.\n\nThere was a roaring within my head--louder, far louder, than that which\nbeat against my ears. Something was drawing me forth; drawing me out of\nmy body into unimaginable depths of blackness. Something was hurling me\nout into those cold depths of space that alone could darken the fires\nthat encircled me--the fires of which I was becoming a part.\n\nI felt myself leap outward--outward and outward--into--oblivion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. PHANTASMAGORIA METALLIQUE.\n\nWearily I opened my eyes. Stiffly, painfully, I stirred. High above\nme was the tremendous circle of sky, ringed with the hosts of feeding\nshields. But the shields were now wanly gleaming and the sky was the sky\nof night.\n\nNight? How long had I lain here? And where was Drake? I struggled to\nrise.\n\n\"Steady, old man,\" his voice came from beside me. \"Steady--and quiet.\nHow are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Badly battered,\" I groaned. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"We weren't used to the show,\" he said. \"We got all fed up at the orgy.\nToo much magnetism--we had a sudden and violent attack of electrical\nindigestion. Sh-h--look ahead of you.\"\n\nGingerly I turned. I had been lying, I now saw, head toward and prone\nat the base of one of the crater's walls. As my gaze swept away I noted\nwith a curious relief that the tiny eye-points were no longer sparkling\nwith their enigmatic life, that they were dulled and dim once more.\n\nBefore me, glimmering pallidly, bristled the mount of the Cones. Around\nits crystal base glittered immense egg-shaped diamond incandescences.\nThey were both rayless and strangely--lightless; they threw no shadows\nnor did their lambency lessen the dimness. Beside each of these curious\nluminosities stood one of the sullen-fired, cruciform shapes--the Things\nthat now I knew for the opened cubes.\n\nThey were smaller than the Keeper, indeed less than half his height.\nThey were ranged in an almost unbroken crescent around the visible arc\nof the immense pedestal--and now I saw that the lights were a few feet\ncloser to that pedestal than they. Egg-shaped as I have said, the wider\nend was undermost, resting in a broad cup upheld by a slender pedicle\nsilvery-gray and metallic.\n\n\"They're building out the base,\" whispered Drake. \"The Cones got so big\nthey have to give them more room.\"\n\n\"Magnetism,\" I whispered in return. \"Electricity--they drew down from\nthe sun spot. And it was more than that--I saw the Cones grow under it.\nIt fed them as it fed the Hordes--but the Cones grew. It was as though\nthe shields and the Cones turned pure energy into substance.\"\n\n\"And if we hadn't been pretty thoroughly magnetized to start with it\nwould have done for us,\" he said.\n\nWe watched the operation going on in front of us. The cross shapes had\nbent, hinging above the transverse arms. They bowed in absolute unison\nas at some signal. Down from the horizontal plane of each whipped the\nlong and writhing tentacles.\n\nAt the foot of every one I could now perceive a heap of some faintly\nglistening material. The tendrils coiled among this, then drew up\nsomething that looked like a thick rod of crystal. The bent planes\nstraightened; simultaneously they thrust the crystalline bars toward the\nincandescences.\n\nThere came a curious, brittle hissing. The ends of the rods began to\ndissolve into dazzling, diamond rain, atomically minute, that passing\nthrough the egg-shaped lights poured upon the periphery of the pedestal.\nRapidly the bars melted. Heat there must be in these lights, terrific\nheat--yet the Keeper's workers seemed impervious to it.\n\nAs the ends of the bars radiated into the annealing mist I saw the\ntentacles creep closer and ever closer to the rayless flame through\nwhich the mist flew. And at the last, as the ultimate atoms drove\nthrough, the holding tendrils were thrust almost within it; touched it,\ncertainly.\n\nA score of times they repeated this process while we watched. Unaware of\nus they seemed, or--if aware, then indifferent. More rapid became their\nmovements, the glassy ingots streaming through the floating braziers\nwith hardly a pause in their passing. Abruptly, as though switched, the\nincandescences lessened into candle-points; instantly, as at a signal,\nthe crescent of crosses closed into a crescent of cubes.\n\nMotionless they stood, huge blocks blackened against the dim glowing\nof the cones--sentient monoliths; a Druid curve; an arc of a metal\nStonehenge. And as at dusk and dawn the great menhirs of Stonehenge fill\nwith a mysterious, granitic life, seem to be praying priests of stone,\nso about these gathered hierophantic illusion.\n\n\nThey quivered; the slender pedicles cupping, the waned lights swayed;\nthe lights lifted and soared, upright, to their backs.\n\nTwo by two with measured pace, solemnly the cubes glided off into the\nencircling darkness. As they swept away there streamed behind them other\nscores not until then visible to us, joining pair by pair from hidden\narcs.\n\nInto the secret shadows they flowed, two by two, each bearing over it\nthe slim shaft holding the serene flame.\n\nGrotesquely were they like a column of monks marching with dimmed\nflambeau of their worship. Angled metal monks of some god of metal,\ncarrying tapers of electric fire, withdrawing slowly from a Holy of\nHolies whose metallically divine Occupant knew nothing of man--nor cared\nto know.\n\nGrotesque--yes. But would that I had the power to crystallize in words\nthe underlying, alien terror every movement of the Metal Monster\nwhen disintegrate, its every manifestation when combined, evoked; the\nincredulous, amazed lurking always close behind the threshold of the\nmind; the never lifting, thin-shuddering shadow.\n\nSmaller, dimmer waned the lights--they were gone.\n\nWe crouched, motionless. Nothing stirred; there was no sound. Without\nspeaking we arose; crept together over the smooth floor toward the\ncones.\n\nAs we crossed I saw that the pave, like the walls, was built of the\nbodies of the Metal People; and, like the walls, they were dormant,\nfilmed eyes oblivious to our passing. Closer we crept--were only a scant\nscore of rods from that colossal mechanism. I noted that the crystal\nfoundation was set low; was not more than four feet above the floor.\nThe sturdy, dwarfed pilasters supporting it thrust up in crowded copses,\nmerging through distance into apparent solidity.\n\nNow, too, I realized, as I had not when looking down from above, how\nstupendous the structure rising from the crystal foundation was.\n\nI began to wonder how so thin a support could bear the mount bristling\nabove it--then remembered what it was that at first had flown from them,\nshrinking them, and at last had fed and swelled them.\n\nLight! Weightless magnetic ions; swarms of electric ions; the misty\nbreath of the infinite energy breathing upon, condensing upon, them.\nCould it be that the Cones for all their apparent mass had little,\nif any, weight? Like ringed Saturn, thousands of times Earth's bulk,\nflaunting itself in the Heavens--yet if transported to our world so\nlight that rings and all it would float like a bubble upon our oceans.\nThe Cones towered above me--close, so close.\n\nThe Cones were weightless. How I knew I cannot say--but now, almost\ntouching them, I did know. Nebulous, yet solid, were they; compact, yet\ntenuous, dense and unsubstantial.\n\nAgain the thought came to me--they were force made visible; energy made\nconcentrate into matter.\n\nWe skirted, seeking for the tablet over which the Keeper had hovered;\nthe mechanism which, under his tentacles, had shifted the circling\nshields, thrust the spear of green fire into the side of the wounded\nsun. Hesitantly I touched the crystal base; the edge was warm, but\nwhether this warmth came from the dazzling rain which we had just\nwatched build it outward or whether it was a property inherent with the\nsubstance itself I do not know.\n\nCertainly there was no mark upon it to show where the molten mists had\nfallen. It was diamond hard and smooth. The nearest cones were but a\nscant nine feet from its rim.\n\nSuddenly we saw the tablet; stood beside it. The shape of a great T,\nglimmering with a faint and limpid violet phosphorescence, it might have\nbeen, in shape and size, the palely shining shadow of the Keeper. It was\na foot above the floor, and had apparently no connection with the cones.\n\nIt was made of thousands of close-packed tiny octagonal rods the tops of\nsome of which were cupped, of others pointed; none was more than half\nan inch in width. There was about it a suggestion of wedded crystal\nand metal--as about its burden was the suggestion of mated energy and\nmatter.\n\nThe rods were movable; they formed a keyboard unimaginably complex;\na keyboard whose infinite combinations were like a Fourth Dimensional\nchess game. I saw that only the swarms of tentacles that were the\nKeeper's hands and these only could be masters of its incredible\nintricacies. No Disk--not even the Emperor, no Star shape could play on\nit, draw out its chords of power.\n\nBut why? Why had it been so made that sullen flaming Cross alone could\nrelease its hidden meanings, made articulate its interwoven octaves?\nAnd how were its messages conveyed? Up to its bases pressed the dormant\ncubes--that under it they lay as well I did not doubt.\n\nThere was no visible copula of the tablet with cones; no antennae\nbetween it and the circled shields. Could it be that the impulses\nreleased by the Keeper's coilings passed through the Metal People of\nthe pave on the upthrust Metal People of the crater rim who held the\nshields?\n\nThat WAS unthinkable--unthinkable because if so this mechanism was\nsuperfluous.\n\nThe swift response to the communal will that we had observed showed that\nthe Metal Monster needed nothing of this kind for transmission of the\nthought of any of its units.\n\nThere was some gap here--a gap that the grouped consciousness could not\nbridge without other means. Clearly that was true--else why the tablet,\nwhy the Keeper's travail?\n\nWas each of these tiny rods a mechanism akin, in a fashion, to the\nsending keys of the wireless; were they transmitters of subtle energy\nin which was enfolded command? Spellers-out of a super-Morse carrying\nto each responsive cell of the Metal Monster the bidding of those higher\nunits which were to It as the brain cells are to us? That, advanced\nas the knowledge it implied might be, was closer to the heart of the\npossible.\n\nI bent, determined, despite the well-nigh unconquerable shrinking I\nfelt, to touch the tablet's rods.\n\nA flickering shadow fell upon me; a flock of pulsating ochreous and\nscarlet shadows--\n\nThe Keeper glowed above us!\n\nIn a life that has had its share of dangers, its need for quick\ndecisions, I recognize that few indeed of my reactions to peril have\nbeen more than purely instinctive; no more consciously courageous\nnor intellectually dissociate from the activating stimulus than the\nshrinking of the burned hand from the brand, the will-to-live dictated\nrush of the cornered animal upon the thing menacing it.\n\nOne such higher functioning was when I followed Larry O'Keefe and Lakla,\nthe Handmaiden, out to what we believed soul-destroying death in a place\nalmost as strange as this *; another was now. Deliberately, detachedly, I\nstudied the angrily flaming Shape.\n\n     * See \"The Moon Pool\" and \"The Conquest of the Moon Pool.\"\n\nCompared to it we were as a pair of Hop-o'-my-Thumbs to the Giant; had\nit been man-shaped we would have come less than a third way up to its\nknees. I focussed my attention upon the twenty-foot-wide square that was\nthe Keeper's foot. Its surface was jewel smooth, hyaline--yet beneath\nit was a suggestion of granulation, of close-packed, innumerable,\nmicroscopic crystals.\n\nWithin these grains whose existence was more sensed than seen glowed\ndull red light, smoky and sullen. At each end of the square, close to\nthe bottom, was a diamond-shaped lozenge, cabochon, perhaps a yard in\nwidth. These were dim yellow, translucent, with no suggestion of the\nunderlying crystallization. Sense organs I set them down to be--similar\nto the great ovals within the Emperor's golden zone.\n\n\nMy gaze traveled up to the transverse arms. They stretched sixty feet\nfrom tip to tip. At each tip were two more of the diamond figures, not\ndull but burning angrily with orange-and-scarlet luster. In the center\nof the beam was something that might have been a smoldering rubrous\nreflection of the Emperor's pulsing multicolored rose had each of the\npetals of the latter been clipped and squared.\n\nIt deepened toward its heart into a singular pattern of vermilion\nlatticings. Into the entire figure ran numerous tiny rivulets of angry\ncrimson and orange light, angling in interwoven patterns with never a\ncurve nor arching.\n\nSet at intervals between them were what looked like octagonal rosettes\nfilled with slender silvery flutings, wan striations--like--it came to\nme--immense chrysanthemum buds, half opened, and carved in gray jade.\n\nAbove towered the gigantic vertical beam. Toward its top I glimpsed a\nhuge square of flaring crimsons and bright topaz; two other diamonds\nstared down upon us from just beneath it--like eyes. And over all its\nheight the striated octagons clustered.\n\nI felt myself lifted, floated upward. Drake's hand shot out, clung to me\nas together we drifted up the living wall. Opposite the latticed heart\nof the square-petaled rose our flight was checked. There for an instant\nwe hung. Then the octagonal symbols stirred, unfolded like buds--\n\nThey were the nests of the Keeper's tentacles, and out from them the\nwhiplike tendrils uncoiled, shot out and writhed toward us.\n\nMy skin flinched from their touch; my body, held in the unseen grip, was\nmotionless. Yet when they touched their contact was not unpleasant. They\nwere like flexible strands of glass; their smooth tips questioned\nus, passing through our hair, searching our faces, writhing over our\nclothing.\n\nThere was a pulse in the great clipped rose, a rhythmic throbbing of\nvermilion fire that ran into it from the angled veins, beat through the\nlatticed nucleus and throbbed back whence it had come. The huge, high\nsquare of scarlet and yellow was liquid flame; the diamond organs\nbeneath it seemed to smoke, to send out swirls of orange red vapor.\n\nHolding us so the Keeper studied us.\n\nThe rhythm of the square rose, became the rhythm of my own mind. But\nhere was none of the vast, serene and elemental calm that Ruth had\ndescribed as emanating from the Metal Emperor. Powerful it was, without\ndoubt, but in it were undertones of rage, of impatience, overtones of\nrevolt, something incomplete and struggling. Within the disharmonies I\nseemed to sense a fettered force striving for freedom; energy battling\nagainst itself.\n\nGreater grew the swarms of the tentacles winding about us like slender\nstrands of glass, covering our faces, making breathing more and\nmore difficult. There was a coil of them around my throat and\ntightening--tightening.\n\nI heard Drake gasping, laboring for breath. I could not turn my head\ntoward him, could not speak. Was this then to be our end?\n\nThe strangling clutch relaxed, the mass of the tentacles lessened. I was\nconscious of a surge of anger through the cruciform Thing that held us.\n\nIts sullen fires blazed. I was aware of another light beating past\nus--beating down the Keeper's. The hosts of tendrils drew back from me.\nI felt myself picked from the unseen grasp, whirled in the air and drawn\naway.\n\nDrake beside me, I hung now before the Shining Disk--the Metal Emperor!\n\nHe it was who had plucked us from the Keeper--and even as I swung I saw\nthe Keeper's multitudinous, serpentine arms surge out toward us angrily\nand then sullenly, slowly, draw back into their nests.\n\nAnd out of the Disk, clothing me, permeating me, came an immense\ntranquillity, a muting of all human thought, all human endeavor, an\nunthinkable, cosmic calm into which all that was human of me seemed to\nbe sinking, drowning as in a fathomless abyss. I struggled against\nit, desperately, striving in study of the Disk to erect a barrier of\npreoccupation against the power pouring from it.\n\nA dozen feet away from us the sapphire ovals centered upon us their\nregard. They were limpid, pellucid as gems whose giant replicas they\nseemed to be. The surface of the Disk ringed about by the aureate zodiac\nin which the nine ovals shone was a maze of geometric symbols traced\nin the lines of living gem fires; infinitely complex those patterns and\ninfinitely beautiful; an infinite number of symmetric forms in which I\nseemed to trace all the ordered crystalline wonders of the snowflakes,\nthe groupings of all crystalline patternings, the soul of ordered beauty\nthat are the marvels of the Radiolaria, Nature's own miraculous book of\nthe soul of mathematical beauty.\n\nThe flashing, petaled heart was woven of living rainbows of cold flame.\n\nSilently we floated there while the Disk--LOOKED--at us.\n\nAnd as though I had been not an actor but an observer, the weird picture\nof it all came to me--two men swinging like motes in mid air, on one\nside the flickering scarlet and orange Cruciform shape, on the other\nside the radiant Disk, behind the two manikins the pallid mount of the\nbristling cones; and high above the wan circle of the shields.\n\nThere was a ringing about us--an elfin chiming, sweet and crystalline.\nIt came from the cones--and strangely was it their vocal synthesis,\ntheir voice. Into the vast circle of sky pierced a lance of green fire;\nswift in its wake uprose others.\n\nWe slid gently down, stood swaying at the Disk's base. The Keeper bent;\nangled. Again the planes above the supporting square hovered over the\ntablet. The tendrils swept down, pushed here and there, playing upon the\nrods some unknown symphony of power.\n\nThicker pulsed the lances of the aurora; changed to vast billowing\ncurtains. The faceted wheel at the top of the central spire of the cones\nswung upward; a light began to stream from the cones themselves--no\npillar now, but a vast circle that shot whirling into the heavens like a\nnoose.\n\nAnd like a noose it caught the aurora, snared it!\n\nInto it the coruscating mists of mysterious flame swirled; lost their\ncolors, became a torrent of light flying down through the ring as though\nthrough a funnel top.\n\nDown poured the radiant corpuscles, bathing the cones. They did not glow\nas they had beneath the flood from the shields, and if they grew it was\ntoo slowly for me to see; the shields were motionless. Now here, now\nthere, I saw the other rings whirl up--smaller mouths of lesser cones\nhidden within the body of the Metal Monster, I knew, sucking down this\nmagnetic flux, these countless ions gushing forth from the sun.\n\nThen as when first we had seen the phenomenon in the valley of the blue\npoppies, the ring vanished, hidden by a fog of coruscations--as though\nthe force streaming through the rings became diffused after it had been\ncaught.\n\nCrouching, forgetful of our juxtaposition to these two unhuman,\nanomalous Things, we watched the play of the tentacles upon the upthrust\nrods.\n\nBut if we forgot, we were not forgotten!\n\nThe Emperor slipped nearer; seemed to contemplate us--quizzically,\nAMUSED; as a man would look down upon some curious and interesting\ninsect, a puppy, a kitten. I sensed this amusement in the Disk's regard\neven as I had sensed its soul of awful tranquillity; as we had sensed\nthe playful malice in the eye stars of the living corridor, the\ncuriosity in the column that had dropped us into the valley.\n\nI felt a push--a push that was filled with a colossal, GLITTERING\nplayfulness.\n\nUnder it I went spinning away for yards--Drake twirling close behind me.\nThe force, whatever it was, swept out from the Emperor, but in it was\nno slightest hint of anger or of malice, no slightest shadow of the\nsinister.\n\nRather it was as though one would blow away a feather; urge gently some\nlittle lesser thing away.\n\nThe Disk watched our whirlings--with a sparkling, jeweled LAUGHTER in\nits pulsing radiance.\n\nAgain came the push--farther yet we spun. Suddenly before us, across the\npave, shone out a twinkling trail--the wakened eyes of the cubes that\nformed it, marking out a pathway for us to follow.\n\nImmediately upon their gleaming forth I saw the Emperor turn--his\nimmense, oval, metallic back now black against the radiance of the\ncones.\n\nUp from the narrow gleaming path--a path opened I knew by some\ncommand--lifted the hosts of tiny unseen hands; the sentient currents of\nmagnetic force that were the fingers and arms of the Metal Hordes. They\nheld us, thrust us along, passed us forward. Faster and faster we moved,\nspeeding on the wake of the long-vanished metal monks.\n\nI turned my head--the cones were already far away. Over the tablet of\nlimpid violet phosphorescence still hovered the planes of the Keeper;\nand still was the oval of the Emperor black against the radiance.\n\nBut the twinkling, sparkling path between us and them was gone--was\nfading out close behind us as we swept onward.\n\nFaster and faster grew our pace. The cylindrical wall loomed close. A\nhigh oblong portal showed within it. Into this we were carried. Before\nus stretched a corridor precisely similar to that which, closing upon\nus, had forced us completely out into the hall.\n\nUnlike that passage, its floor lifted steeply--a smooth and shining\nslide up which no man could climb. A shaft, indeed, which thrust upward\nstraight as an arrow at an angle of at least thirty degrees and whose\nend or turning we could not see. Up and up it cleared its way through\nthe City--through the Metal Monster--closed only by the inability of\nthe eye to pierce the faint luminosity that thickened by distance became\nimpenetrable.\n\nFor an instant we hovered upon its threshold. But the impulse, the\ncommand, that had carried us thus far was not to stop here. Into it and\nup it we were thrust, our feet barely touching the glimmering surface;\nlifted by the force that emanated from its floor, carried on by the\nforce that pressed out from the sides.\n\nUp and up we went--scores of feet--hundreds--\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. THE ENSORCELLED CHAMBER\n\n\"Goodwin!\" Drake broke the silence; desperately he was striving to keep\nhis fear out of his voice. \"Goodwin--this isn't the way to get out.\nWe're going up--farther away all the time from the--the gates!\"\n\n\"What can we do?\" My anxiety was no less than his, but my realization of\nour helplessness was complete.\n\n\"If we only knew how to talk to these Things,\" he said. \"If we could\nonly have let the Disk know we wanted to get out--damn it, Goodwin, it\nwould have helped us.\"\n\nGrotesque as the idea sounded, I felt that he spoke the truth. The\nEmperor meant no harm to us; in fact in speeding us away I was not at\nall sure that he had not deliberately wished us well--there was that\nabout the Keeper--\n\nStill up we sped along the shaft. I knew we must now be above the level\nof the valley.\n\n\"We've got to get back to Ruth! Goodwin--NIGHT! And what may have\nHAPPENED to her?\"\n\n\"Drake, boy\"--I dropped into his own colloquialism--\"we're up against\nit. We can't help it. And remember--she's there in Norhala's home. I\ndon't believe, I honestly don't believe, Dick, that there's any danger\nas long as she remains there. And Ventnor ties her fast.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" he said, more hopefully. \"That's true--and probably\nNorhala is with her by now.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it,\" I said cheerfully. An idea came to me--I half\nbelieved it myself. \"And another thing. There's not an action here\nthat's purposeless. We're being driven on by the command of that Thing\nwe call the Metal Emperor. It means us no harm. Maybe--maybe this IS the\nway out.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" he shook his head doubtfully. \"But I'm not sure. Maybe that\nlong push was just to get us away from THERE. And it strikes me that the\nimpulse has begun to weaken. We're not going anywhere near as fast as we\nwere.\"\n\nI had not realized it, but our speed was slackening. I looked\nback--hundreds of feet behind us fell the slide. An unpleasant chill\nwent through me--should the magnetic grip upon us relax, withdraw,\nnothing could stop us from falling back along that incline to be broken\nlike eggs at its end; that our breaths would be snuffed out by the\nterrific descent long before we reached that end was scant comfort.\n\n\"There are other passages opening up along this shaft,\" Drake said.\n\"I'm not for trusting the Emperor too far--he has other things on his\nmetallic mind, you know. The next one we get to, let's try to slip\ninto--if we can.\"\n\nI had noticed; there had been openings along the ascending shaft;\ncorridors running apparently transversely to its angled way.\n\nSlower and slower became our pace. A hundred yards above I glimpsed one\nof the apertures. Could we reach it? Slower and slower we arose. Now the\ngap was but a yard off--but we were motionless--were tottering!\n\nDrake's arms wrapped round me. With a tremendous effort he hurled me\ninto the portal. I dropped at its edge, writhed swiftly around, saw him\nslipping, slipping down--thrust my hands out to him.\n\nHe caught them. There came a wrench that tortured my arm sockets as\nthough racked. But he held!\n\nSlowly--I writhed back into the passage, dragging up his almost dead\nweight. His head appeared, his shoulders; there was a convulsion of the\nlong body and he lay before me.\n\n\nFor a minute or two we lay, flat upon our backs resting. I sat up. The\npassage was broad, silent; apparently as endless as that from which we\nhad just escaped.\n\nAlong it, above us, under us, the crystalline eyes were dim. It showed\nno sign of movement--yet had it done so there was nothing we could do\nsave drop down the annihilating slant. Drake arose.\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" he said, \"and I'm thirsty. I move that we eat and drink\nand approximately be merry.\"\n\nHe slung aside the haversack. From it we took food; from the canteens\nwe drank. We did not talk. Each knew what the other was thinking;\ninfrequently, and thank the eternal law that some call God for that,\ncome crises in which speech seems not only petty but when against it the\nmind rebels as a nauseous thing.\n\nThis was such a time. At last I drew myself to my feet.\n\n\"Let's be going,\" I said.\n\nThe corridor stretched straight before us; along it we paced. How far we\nwalked I do not know; mile upon mile, it seemed. It broadened abruptly\ninto a vast hall.\n\nAnd this hall was filled with the Metal Hordes--was a gigantic workshop\nof them. In every shape, in every form, they seethed and toiled about\nit. Upon its floor were heaps of shining ores, mounds of flashing gems,\npiles of ingots, metallic and crystalline. High and low throughout\nflamed the egg-shaped incandescences; floating furnaces both great and\nsmall.\n\nBefore one of these forges, close to us, stood a Metal Thing. Its body\nwas a twelve-foot column of smaller cubes. Upon the top was a hollow\nsquare formed of even lesser blocks--blocks hardly larger than the\nLittle Things themselves. In the center of the open rectangle was\nanother shaft, its top a two-foot square plate formed of a single cube.\n\nFrom the sides of the hollow square sprang long arms of spheres, each\ntipped by a tetrahedron. They moved freely, slipping about upon their\ncurved points of contact and like a dozen little thinking hammers,\nthe pyramid points at their ends beat down upon as many thimble shaped\nobjects which they thrust alternately into the unwinking brazier then\nlaid upon the central block to shape.\n\nA goblin workman the Thing seemed, standing there, so intent upon and so\nbusy with its forgings.\n\nThere were scores of these animate machines; they paid no slightest\nheed to us as we slipped by them, clinging as closely to the wall of the\nimmense workshop as we could.\n\nWe passed a company of other Shapes which stood two by two and close\ntogether, their tops wide spinning wheels through which the tendrils\nof an opened globe fed translucent, colorless ingots--the substance it\nseemed to me of which Norhala's shadowy walls were made, the crystal of\nwhich the bars that built out the base of the Cones were formed.\n\nThe ingots passed between the whirling faces; emerged from them as\nslender, long cylinders; were seized as they slipped down by a crouching\nblock, whose place as it glided away was instantly taken by another. In\nmany bewildering forms, intent upon unknown activities directed toward\nunguessable ends, the composite, animate mechanisms labored. And all the\nplace was filled with a goblin bustle, trollish racketings, ringing of\ngnomish anvils, clanging of kobold forges--a clamorous cavern filled\nwith metal Nibelungens.\n\nWe came to the opening of another passage, a doorway piercing the walls\nof the workshop. Its incline, though steep, was not dangerous.\n\nInto it we stepped; climbed onward it seemed interminably. Far ahead\nof us at last appeared the outline of its further entrance, silhouetted\nagainst and filled with a brighter luminosity. We drew near; stopped\ncautiously at its threshold, peering out.\n\nWell it was that we had hesitated. Before us was open space--an abyss in\nthe body of the Metal Monster.\n\nThe corridor opened into it like a window. Thrusting out our heads,\nwe saw an unbroken wall both above and below. Half a mile away was\nits opposite side. Over this pit was a misty sky and not more than a\nthousand feet above and black against the heavens was the lip of it--the\ncornices of this chasm within the City.\n\nFar, far beneath us we watched the Hordes throw themselves across the\nabyss in webs of curving arches and girder-straight bridges; gigantic\nwe knew these spans must be yet dwarfed to slender footways by\ndistance. Over them moved hurrying companies; from them came flashings,\nglitterings--prismatic, sun golden; plutonic scarlets, molten blues;\njavelins of colored light piercing upward from unfolded cubes and globes\nand pyramids crossing them or from busy bearers of the shining fruits of\nthe mysterious workshops.\n\nAnd as they passed the bridges swung up, coiled and thrust themselves\nfrom sight through openings that closed behind them. Ever, as they\npassed, close on their going whipped out other spans so that always\nacross that abyss a sentient, shifting web was hung.\n\nWe drew back, stared into each other's white face. Panic swept through\nme, in quick, alternate pulse of ice and fire. For crushingly, no longer\nto be denied, came certainty that we were lost within the mazes of this\nincredible City--lost in the body of the Metal Monster which that City\nwas. There was a sick despair in my heart as we turned and slowly made\nour way back along the sloping corridor.\n\nA hundred yards, perhaps, we had gone in silence before we stopped,\ngazing stupidly at an opening in the wall beside us. The portal had not\nbeen there when we had passed--of that I was certain.\n\n\"It's opened since we went by,\" whispered Drake.\n\nWe peered through it. The passage was narrow; its pave led downward.\nFor a moment we hesitated, the same foreboding in both our minds. And\nyet--among the perils that crowded in upon us what choice had we? There\ncould be no more danger there than here.\n\nBoth ways were--ALIVE, both obedient to impulses over which we had\nno more control and no more way of predetermining than mice in some\ncomplex, man-made trap. Furthermore, this shaft also ran downward, and\nalthough its pitch was less and it did not therefore drop as quickly\ntoward that level we sought and wherein lay the openings of escape into\nthe outer valley, it fell at right angles to the corridor through which\nwe had come.\n\nWe knew that to retrace our steps now would but take us back to the\nforges and thence to the hall of the Cones and the certain peril waiting\nfor us there.\n\nWe stepped into this opened way. For a little distance it ran\nstraightly, then turned and sloped gently upward; and a little distance\nmore we climbed. Then suddenly, not a hundred yards from us, gushed out\na flood of soft radiance, opalescent, filled with pearly glimmerings and\nrosy shadows of light.\n\nIt was as though a door had opened into some world of luminescence. From\nit the lambent torrent poured; billowed down upon us. In its wake\ncame music--if music the mighty harmonies, the sonorous chords, the\ncrystalline themes and the linked chaplet of notes that were like\nspiralings of tiny golden star bells could be named.\n\nToward source of light and sound we moved, nor could we have halted nor\nwithdrawn had we willed; the radiance drew us to it as the sun the water\ndrop, and irresistibly the sweet, unearthly music called. Closer we\ncame--it was a narrow alcove from which sound and light poured--into it\nwe crept--and went no further.\n\nWe peered into a vast and columnless vault, a limitless temple of light.\nHigh up in it, strewn manifold, danced and shone soft orbs like tender\nsuns. No pale gilt luminaries of frozen rays were these. Effulgent,\njubilant, they flamed--orbs red as wine of rubies that Djinns of Al\nShiraz press from his enchanted vineyards of jewels; twin orbs\nrosy white as breasts of pampered Babylonian maids; orbs of pulsing\nopalescences and orbs of the murmuring green of bursting buds of spring,\ncrocused orbs and orbs of royal coral; suns that throbbed with singing\nrays of wedded rose and pearl and of sapphires and topazes amorous; orbs\nborn of cool virginal dawns and of imperial sunsets and orbs that were\nthe tuliped fruit of mating rainbows of fire.\n\nThey danced, these countless aureoles; they swung and threaded in\nradiant choral patterns, in linked harmonies of light. And as they\ndanced their gay rays caressed and bathed myriads of the Metal Folk open\nbeneath them. Under the rays the jewel fires of disk and star and cross\nleaped and pulsed and danced to the same bright rhythm.\n\nWe sought the source of the music--a tremendous thing of shimmering\ncrystal pipes like some colossal organ. Out of the radiance around it\ngreat flames gathered, shook into sight with streamings and pennonings,\nin bannerets and bandrols, leaped upon the crystal pipes, and merged\nwithin them.\n\nAnd as the pipes drank them the flames changed into sound!\n\nThrobbing bass viols of roaring vernal winds, diapasons of waterfall\nand torrents--these had been flames of emerald; flaming trumpetings of\ndesire that had been great streamers of scarlet--rose flames that had\ndissolved into echoes of fulfillment; diamond burgeonings that melted\ninto silver symphonies like mist entangled Pleiades transmuted into\nmelodies; chameleon harmonies to which the strange suns danced.\n\nAnd now I saw--realizing with a clutch of indescribable awe, with\na sense of inexplicable profanation the secret of this ensorcelled\nchamber.\n\nWithin every pulsing rose of irised fire that was the heart of a disk,\nfrom every rubrous, clipped rose of a cross, and from every rayed purple\npetaling of a star there nestled a tiny disk, a tiny cross, a tiny star,\nluminous and symboled even as those that cradled them.\n\nThe Metal Babes building like crystals from hearts of radiance beneath\nthe play of jocund orbs!\n\nIncredible blossomings of crystal and of metal whose lullabies and\ncradle songs were singing symphonies of flame.\n\nIt was the birth chamber of the City!\n\nThe womb of the Metal Monster!\n\nAbruptly the walls of the niche sparkled out, the glittering eye points\nregarding us with a most disquieting suggestion of sentinels who,\nslumbering, had been caught unaware, and now awakening challenged us.\nSwiftly the niche closed--so swiftly that barely had we time to spring\nover its threshold into the corridor.\n\nThe corridor was awake--alive!\n\nThe power darted out; gripped us. Up it swept us and on. Far away a\nsquare of light appeared, grew quickly larger. Framed in it was the\namethystine burning of the great ring that girdled the encircling\ncliffs.\n\nI turned my head--behind us the corridor was closing!\n\nNow the opening was so close that through it I could see the vast\npanorama of the valley. The wall behind us touched us; pushed us on.\nWe thrust ourselves against it, despairingly. As well might flies have\ntried to press back a moving mountain.\n\nResistingly, inexorably we were pressed forward. Now we cowered within a\nyard-deep niche; now we trembled upon a foot-wide ledge.\n\nShuddering, gasping, we glared down the sheer drop of the City's wall.\nThe smooth and glimmering scarp fell thousands of feet straight to the\nvalley floor. And there were no merciful mists to hide what awaited us\nthere; no mists anywhere. In that brief, agonized glance every detail of\nthe Pit was disclosed with an abnormal clarity.\n\nWe tottered on the brink. The ledge melted.\n\nDown, down we plunged, locked in each other's arms, hurtling to the\nshattering death so far below!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE TREACHERY OF YURUK\n\nWas it true that Time is within ourselves--that like Space, its twin, it\nis only a self-created illusion of the human mind? There are hours that\nflash by on hummingbird wings; there are seconds that shuffle on shod in\nleaden shoes.\n\nWas it true that when death faces us the consciousness finds power\nthrough its will to live to conquer the illusion--to prolong Time? That,\nrecoiling from oblivion, we can recreate in a fractional moment whole\nyears gone past, years yet to come--striving to lengthen our existence,\nstretching out our apperception beyond the phantom boundaries,\noverdrawing upon a Barmecide deposit of minutes, staking fresh claims\nupon a mirage?\n\nHow else explain the seeming slowness with which we were falling--the\nseeming leisureness with which the wall drifted up past us?\n\nAnd was this punishment--a sentence meted out for profaning with our\neyes a forbidden place; a penalty for touching with our gaze the ark of\nthe Metal Tribes--their holy of holies--the budding place of the Metal\nBabes?\n\nThe valley was swinging--swinging in slow broad curves; was oscillating\ndizzily.\n\nSlowly the colossal wall slipped upward.\n\nRealization swept me; left me amazed; only half believing. This was no\nillusion. After that first swift plunge our fall had been checked. We\nwere swinging--not the valley.\n\nDeliberately, in wide arcs like pendulums, we were swinging across the\nCity's scarp; three feet out from it, and as we swung, slowly sinking.\n\nAnd now I saw the countless eyes of the watching wall again were\ntwinkling, regarding us with impish mockery.\n\nIt was the grip of the living wall that held us; that rocked us from\nside to side as though giving greater breadths of it chance to behold\nus; that was dropping us gently, carefully, to the valley floor now a\nscant two thousand feet below.\n\nA storm of rage, of intensest resentment swept me; as once before any\ngratitude I should have felt for escape was submerged in the utter\nhumiliation with which it was charged.\n\nI shook my fists at the twinkling wall, strove to kick and smite it like\nan angry child, cursed it--not childishly. Dared it to hurl me down to\ndeath.\n\nI felt Drake's hand touch mine.\n\n\"Steady,\" he said. \"Steady, old boy. It's no use. Steady. Look down.\"\n\nHot with shame for my outburst, weak from its violence, I obeyed. The\nvalley floor was not more than a thousand feet away. Thronging about\nwhere we must at last touch, clustered and seething, was a multitude of\nthe Metal Things. They seemed to be looking up at us, watching, waiting\nfor us.\n\n\"Reception committee,\" grinned Drake.\n\nI glanced away; over the valley. It was luminously clear; yet the sky\nwas overcast, no stars showing. The light was no stronger than that of\nthe moon at full, but it held a quality unfamiliar to me. It cast no\nshadows; though soft, it was piercing, revealing all it bathed with the\ndistinctness of bright sunshine. The illumination came, I thought, from\nthe encircling veils falling from the band of amethyst.\n\nAnd, as I peered, out of the veils and far away sped a violet spark.\nWith meteor speed it flew toward us. Close to the base of the vast\nfacade it landed with a flashing of blue incandescence. I knew it\nfor one of the Flying Things, the Mark Makers--one of the incredible\nmessengers.\n\nClose upon its fall came increase in the turmoil of the crowding throng\nawaiting us. Came, too, an abrupt change in our own motion. The long\narcs lessened. We were dropped more swiftly.\n\nFar away in the direction from which the Flying Thing had flown I\nsensed another movement; something coming that carried with it subtle\nsuggestion of unlikeness to all the other incessant, linked movement\nover the pit. Closer it drew.\n\n\"Norhala!\" gasped Drake.\n\nRobed in her silken amber swathings, red-copper hair streaming, woven\nwith elfin sparklings, she was racing toward the City like some lovely\nwitch, riding upon the back of a steed of huge cubes.\n\nNearer she raced. More direct became our fall. Now we were dropping as\nthough at the end of an unreeling plummet cord; the floor of the valley\nwas no more than two hundred feet below.\n\n\"Norhala!\" we shouted; and again and again--again \"Norhala!\"\n\nBefore our cries could have reached her the cubes swerved; came to a\nhalt beneath us. Through the hundred feet of space between I caught the\nbrilliancy of the weird constellations in Norhala's great eyes--saw with\na vague but no less dire foreboding that on her face dwelt a terrifying,\na blasting wrath.\n\nAs softly as though by the hand of a giant of cloud we were lifted out\nfrom the wall, and were set with no perceptible shock beside her on the\nback of the cubes.\n\n\"Norhala--\" I stopped. For this was no Norhala whom we had known. Gone\nwas all calm, vanished every trace of unearthly tranquillity. It was a\nNorhala awakened at last--all human.\n\nYet in the still rage that filled her I sensed a force, an intensity,\nmore than human. Over the blazing eyes the brows were knit in a rigid,\ngolden bar; the delicate nostrils were pinched; the sweet red mouth was\nwhite and merciless. It was as though in its long sleep her human\nself had gathered more than human strength, and that now, awakened and\nunleashed, the violence of its rage touched the vibrant zenith of that\nsphere of which her quiet had been the nadir.\n\n\nShe was like an urn filled and flaming with the fires of the Gods of\nwrath.\n\nWhat was it that had awakened her--what in awakening had changed the\ninpouring human consciousness into this flood of fury? Foreboding\ngripped me.\n\n\"Norhala!\" My voice was shaking. \"Those we left--\"\n\n\"They are gone!\" The golden voice was octaves deeper, vibrant, throbbing\nwith that muffled, menacing note that must have pulsed from the\ngolden tambours that summoned to battle Timur's fierce hordes. \"They\nwere--taken.\"\n\n\"Taken!\" I gasped. \"Taken by what--these?\" I swept my hands out toward\nthe Metal Things milling around us.\n\n\"No! THESE are mine. These are they who obey me.\" The golden voice now\nshrilled with her passion. \"Taken by--men!\"\n\nDrake had read my face although he could not understand our words.\n\n\"Ruth--\"\n\n\"Taken,\" I said. \"Both Ruth and Ventnor. Taken by the armored men--the\nmen of Cherkis!\"\n\n\"Cherkis!\" She had caught the word. \"Yes--Cherkis! And now he and all\nhis men--and all his women--and every living thing he rules shall pay.\nAnd fear not--you two. For I, Norhala, will bring back my own.\n\n\"Woe, woe to you, Cherkis, and to all of yours! For I, Norhala, am\nawake, and I, Norhala, remember. Woe to you, Cherkis, woe--for now all\nends for you!\n\n\"Not by the gods of my mother who turned their strength against her do\nI promise this. I, Norhala, have no need for them--I, Norhala, who have\nstrength greater than they. And would I could crush those gods as I\nshall crush you, Cherkis--and every living thing of yours! Yea--and\nevery UNLIVING thing as well!\"\n\nNot halting now was Norhala's speech; it poured from the ruthless\nlips--flamingly.\n\n\"We go,\" she cried. \"And something of vengeance I have saved for you--as\nis your right.\"\n\nShe tossed her arms high; stamped upon the back of the Metal Thing that\nheld us.\n\nIt quivered and sped away. Swiftly dwindled the City's bulk; fast faded\nits glimmering watchful face.\n\nNot toward the veils of light but out over the plain we flew. Above us,\ncrouching against the blast of our going, streamed like a silken banner\nNorhala's hair, gemmed with the witch lights.\n\nWe were far out now, the City far away. The cube slowed. Norhala threw\nhigh her head. From the arched, exquisite throat pealed a trumpet\ncall--golden, summoning, imperious. Thrice it rang forth--and all the\nsurrounding valley seemed to halt and listen.\n\nFollowed upon its ending, a chanting as goldenly sonorous. Wild,\nperemptory, triumphant. It was like a mustering shouting to adventurous\nstars, buglings to buccaneering winds, cadenced beckonings to restless\nranks of viking waves, signaling to all the corsairs and picaroons of\nthe elemental.\n\nA cosmic call to slay!\n\nThe gigantic block upon which we rode quivered; I myself felt a thousand\nneedle-pointed roving arrows prick me, urging me on to some jubilant,\nreckless orgy of destruction.\n\nObeying that summoning there swirled to us cube and globe and pyramid\nby the score--by the hundreds. They swept into our wake and\nfollowed--lifting up behind us, an ever-rising sea.\n\nHigher and higher arose the metal wave--mounting, ever mounting as other\nscore upon score leaped upon it, rushed up it and swelled its crest. And\nsoon so great it was that it shadowed us, hung over us.\n\nThe cubes we rode angled in their course; raced now with ever-increasing\nspeed toward the spangled curtains.\n\nAnd still Norhala's golden chant lured; higher and even higher reached\nthe following wave. Now we were rising upon a steep slope; now the\namethystine, gleaming ring was almost overheard.\n\nNorhala's song ceased. One breathless, soundless moment and we had\npierced the veils. A globule of sapphire shone afar, the elfin bubble of\nher home. We neared it.\n\n\nHeart leaping, I saw three ponies, high and empty saddles turquoise\nstudded, lift their heads from their roadway browsing. For a moment they\nstood, stiff with terror; then whimpering raced away.\n\nWe were at Norhala's door; were lifted down; stood close to its\nthreshold. Slaves to a single thought, Drake and I sprang to enter.\n\n\"Wait!\" Norhala's white hands caught us. \"There is peril there--without\nme! Me you must--follow!\"\n\nUpon the exquisite face was no unshadowing of wrath, no diminishing of\nrage, no weakening of dreadful determination. The star-flecked eyes were\nnot upon us; they looked over and beyond--coldly, calculatingly.\n\n\"Not enough,\" I heard her whisper. \"Not enough--for that which I will\ndo.\"\n\nWe turned, following her gaze. A hundred feet on high, stretching nearly\nacross the gorge, an incredible curtain was flung. Over its folds was\nmovement--arms of spinning globes that thrust forth like paws and down\nupon which leaped pyramid upon pyramid stiffening as they clung like\nbristling spikes of hair; great bars of clicking cubes that threw\nthemselves from the shuttering--shook and withdrew. The curtain was a\nferment--shifting, mercurial; it throbbed with desire, palpitated with\neagerness.\n\n\"Not enough!\" murmured Norhala.\n\nHer lips parted; from them came another trumpeting--tyrannic, arrogant\nand clangorous. Under it the curtaining writhed--out from it spurted\nthin cascades of cubes. They swarmed up into tall pillars that shook and\nswayed and gyrated.\n\nWith blinding flash upon flash the sapphire incandescences struck forth\nat their feet. A score of flaming columned shapes leaped up and curved\nin meteor flight over the tumultuous curtain. Streaming with violet\nfires they shot back to the valley of the City.\n\n\"Hai!\" shouted Norhala as they flew. \"Hai!\"\n\nUp darted her arms; the starry galaxies of her eyes danced madly, shot\nforth visible rays. The mighty curtain of the Metal Things pulsed and\nthrobbed; its units interweaving--block and globe and pyramid of which\nit was woven, each seeming to strain at leash.\n\n\"Come!\" cried Norhala--and led the way through the portal.\n\nClose behind her we pressed. I stumbled, nearly fell, over a\nbrown-faced, leather-cuirassed body that lay half over, legs barring the\nthreshold.\n\nContemptuously Norhala stepped over it. We were within that chamber of\nthe pool. About it lay a fair dozen of the armored men. Ruth's defense,\nI thought with a grim delight, had been most excellent--those who had\ntaken her and Ventnor had not done so without paying full toll.\n\nA violet flashing drew my eyes away. Close to the pool wherein we had\nfirst seen the white miracle of Norhala's body, two immense, purple\nfired stars blazed. Between them, like a suppliant cast from black iron,\nwas Yuruk.\n\nPoised upon their nether tips the stars guarded him. Head touching his\nknees, eyes hidden within his folded arms, the black eunuch crouched.\n\n\"Yuruk!\"\n\nThere was an unearthly mercilessness in Norhala's voice.\n\nThe eunuch raised his head; slowly, fearfully.\n\n\"Goddess!\" he whispered. \"Goddess! Mercy!\"\n\n\"I saved him,\" she turned to us, \"for you to slay. He it was who brought\nthose who took the maid who was mine and the helpless one she loved.\nSlay him.\"\n\nDrake understood--his hand twitched down to his pistol, drew it. He\nleveled the gun at the black eunuch. Yuruk saw it--shrieked and cowered.\nNorhala laughed--sweetly, ruthlessly.\n\n\"He dies before the stroke falls,\" she said. \"He dies doubly\ntherefore--and that is well.\"\n\nDrake slowly lowered the automatic; turned to me.\n\n\"I can't,\" he said. \"I can't--do it--\"\n\n\"Masters!\" Upon his knees the eunuch writhed toward us. \"Masters--I\nmeant no wrong. What I did was for love of the Goddess. Years upon years\nI have served her. And her mother before her.\n\n\"I thought if the maid and the blasted one were gone, that you would\nfollow. Then I would be alone with the Goddess once more. Cherkis will\nnot slay them--and Cherkis will welcome you and give the maid and the\nblasted one back to you for the arts that you can teach him.\n\n\"Mercy, Masters, I meant no harm--bid the Goddess be merciful!\"\n\n\nThe ebon pools of eyes were clarified of their ancient shadows by his\nterror; age was wiped from them by fear, even as it was wiped from his\nface. The wrinkles were gone. Appallingly youthful, the face of Yuruk\nprayed to us.\n\n\"Why do you wait?\" she asked us. \"Time presses, and even now we should\nbe on the way. When so many are so soon to die, why tarry over one? Slay\nhim!\"\n\n\"Norhala,\" I answered, \"we cannot slay him so. When we kill, we kill in\nfair fight--hand to hand. The maid we both love has gone, taken with her\nbrother. It will not bring her back if we kill him through whom she was\ntaken. We would punish him--yes, but slay him we cannot. And we would be\nafter the maid and her brother quickly.\"\n\nA moment she looked at us, perplexity shading the high and steady anger.\n\n\"As you will,\" she said at last; then added, half sarcastically,\n\"Perhaps it is because I who am now awake have slept so long that I\ncannot understand you. But Yuruk has disobeyed ME. That of MINE which\nI committed to his care he has given to the enemies of me and those who\nwere mine. It matters nothing to me what YOU would do. Matters to me\nonly what I will to do.\"\n\nShe pointed to the dead.\n\n\"Yuruk\"--the golden voice was cold--\"gather up these carrion and pile\nthem together.\"\n\nThe eunuch arose, stole out fearfully from between the two stars. He\nslithered to body after body, dragging them one after the other to the\ncenter of the chamber, lifting them and forming of them a heap. One\nthere was who was not dead. His eyes opened as the eunuch seized him,\nthe blackened mouth opened.\n\n\"Water!\" he begged. \"Give me drink. I burn!\"\n\nI felt a thrill of pity; lifted my canteen and walked toward him.\n\n\"You of the beard,\" the merciless chime rang out, \"he shall have no\nwater. But drink he shall have, and soon--drink of fire!\"\n\nThe soldier's fevered eyes rolled toward her, saw and read aright the\nruthlessness in the beautiful face.\n\n\"Sorceress!\" he groaned. \"Cursed spawn of Ahriman!\" He spat at her.\n\nThe black talons of Yuruk stretched around his throat\n\n\"Son of unclean dogs!\" he whined. \"You dare blaspheme the Goddess!\"\n\nHe snapped the soldier's neck as though it had been a rotten twig.\n\nAt the callous cruelty I stood for an instant petrified; I heard Drake\nswear wildly, saw his pistol flash up.\n\nNorhala struck down his arm.\n\n\"Your chance has passed,\" she said, \"and not for THAT shall you slay\nhim.\"\n\nAnd now Yuruk had cast that body upon the others; the pile was complete.\n\n\"Mount!\" commanded Norhala, and pointed. He cast himself at her feet,\nwrithing, moaning, imploring. She looked at one of the great Shapes;\nsomething of command passed from her, something it understood plainly.\n\nThe star slipped forward--there was an almost imperceptible movement of\nits side points. The twitching form of the black seemed to leap up from\nthe floor, to throw itself like a bag upon the mound of the dead.\n\nNorhala threw up her hands. Out of the violet ovals beneath the upper\ntips of the Things spurted streams of blue flame. They fell upon Yuruk\nand splashed over him upon the heap of the slain. In the mound was a\ndreadful movement, a contortion; the bodies stiffened, seemed to try to\nrise, to push away--dead nerves and muscles responding to the blasting\nenergy passing through them.\n\nOut from the stars rained bolt upon bolt. In the chamber was the sound\nof thunder, crackling like broken glass. The bodies flamed, crumbled.\nThere was a little smoke--nauseous, feebly protesting, beaten out by the\nconsuming fires almost before it could rise.\n\nWhere had been the heap of slain capped by the black eunuch there was\nbut a little whirling cloud of sad gray dust. Caught by a passing\ndraft, it eddied, slipped over the floor, vanished through the doorway.\nMotionless stood the blasting stars, contemplating us. Motionless\nstood Norhala, her wrath no whit abated by the ghastly sacrifice. And\nparalyzed by what we had beheld, motionless stood we.\n\n\"Listen,\" she said. \"You two who love the maid. What you have seen is\nnothing to that which you SHALL see--a wisp of mist to the storm cloud.\"\n\n\"Norhala\"--I found speech--\"can you tell us when it was that the maid\nwas captured?\"\n\nPerhaps there was still time to overtake the abductors before Ruth was\nthrust into the worse peril waiting where she was being carried. Crossed\nthis thought another--puzzling, baffling. The cliffs Yuruk had pointed\nout to me as those through which the hidden way passed were, I had\nestimated then, at least twenty miles away. And how long was the pass,\nthe tunnel, through them? And then how far this place of the armored\nmen? It had been past dawn when Drake had frightened the black eunuch\nwith his pistol. It was not yet dawn now. How could Yuruk have made his\nway to the Persians so swiftly--how could they so swiftly have returned?\n\nAmazingly she answered the spoken question and the unspoken.\n\n\"They came long before dusk,\" she said. \"By the night before Yuruk had\nwon to Ruszark, the city of Cherkis; and long before dawn they were on\ntheir way hither. This the black dog I slew told me.\"\n\n\"But Yuruk was with us here at dawn yesterday,\" I gasped.\n\n\"A night has passed since then,\" she said, \"and another night is almost\ngone.\"\n\nStunned, I considered this. If this were true--and not for an instant\ndid I doubt her--then not for a few hours had we lain there at the foot\nof the living wall in the Hall of the Cones--but for the balance of that\nday and that night, and another day and part of still another night.\n\n\"What does she say?\" Drake stared anxiously into my whitened face. I\ntold him.\n\n\"Yes.\" Norhala spoke again. \"The dusk before the last dusk that has\npassed I returned to my house. The maid was there and sorrowing. She\ntold me you had gone into the valley, prayed me to help you and to bring\nyou back. I comforted her, and something of--the peace--I gave her; but\nnot all, for she fought against it. A little we played together, and I\nleft her sleeping. I sought you and found you also sleeping. I knew no\nharm would come to you, and I went my ways--and forgot you. Then I came\nhere again--and found Yuruk and these the maid had slain.\"\n\nThe great eyes flashed.\n\n\"Now do I honor the maid for the battle that she did,\" she said, \"though\nhow she slew so many strong men I do not know. My heart goes out to her.\nAnd therefore when I bring her back she shall no more be plaything to\nNorhala, but sister. And with you it shall be as she wills. And woe to\nthose who have taken her!\"\n\nShe paused, listening. From without came a rising storm of thin\nwailings, insistent and eager.\n\n\"But I have an older vengeance than this to take,\" the golden voice\ntolled somberly. \"Long have I forgotten--and shame I feel that I\nhad forgot. So long have I forgotten all hatreds, all lusts, all\ncruelty--among--these--\" She thrust a hand forth toward the hidden\nvalley. \"Forgot--dwelling in the great harmonies. Save for you and what\nhas befallen I would never have stirred from them, I think. But now\nawakened, I take that vengeance. After it is done\"--she paused--\"after\nit is over I shall go back again. For this awakening has in it nothing\nof the ordered joy I love--it is a fierce and slaying fire. I shall go\nback--\"\n\nThe shadow of her far dreaming flitted over, softened the angry\nbrilliancy of her eyes.\n\n\"Listen, you two!\" The shadow of dream fled. \"Those that I am about to\nslay are evil--evil are they all, men and women. Long have they been\nso--yea, for cycles of suns. And their children grow like them--or\nif they be gentle and with love for peace they are slain or die of\nheartbreak. All this my mother told me long ago. So no more children\nshall be born from them either to suffer or to grow evil.\"\n\nAgain she paused, nor did we interrupt her musing.\n\n\"My father ruled Ruszark,\" she said at last. \"Rustum he was named, of\nthe seed of Rustum the Hero even as was my mother. They were gentle and\ngood, and it was their ancestors who built Ruszark when, fleeing from\nthe might of Iskander, they were sealed in the hidden valley by the\nfalling mountain.\n\n\"Then there sprang from one of the families of the nobles--Cherkis.\nEvil, evil was he, and as he grew he lusted for rule. On a night of\nterror he fell upon those who loved my father and slew; and barely had\nmy father time to fly from the city with my mother, still but a bride,\nand a handful of those loyal to him.\n\n\"They found by chance the way to this place, hiding in the cleft which\nis its portal. They came, and they were taken by--Those who are now my\npeople. Then my mother, who was very beautiful, was lifted before him\nwho rules here and she found favor in his sight and he had built for her\nthis house, which now is mine.\n\n\"And in time I was born--but not in this house. Nay--in a secret place\nof light where, too, are born my people.\"\n\nShe was silent. I shot a glance at Drake. The secret place of light--was\nit not that vast vault of mystery, of dancing orbs and flames transmuted\ninto music into which we had peered and for which sacrilege, I had\nthought, had been thrust from the City? And did in this lie the\nexplanation of her strangeness? Had she there sucked in with her\nmother's milk the enigmatic life of the Metal Hordes, been transformed\ninto half human changeling, become true kin to them? What else could\nexplain--\n\n\n\"My mother showed me Ruszark,\" her voice, taking up once more her tale,\nchecked my thoughts. \"Once when I was little she and my father bore me\nthrough the forest and through the hidden way. I looked upon Ruszark--a\ngreat city it is and populous, and a caldron of cruelty and of evil.\n\n\"Not like me were my father and mother. They longed for their kind and\nsought ever for means to regain their place among them. There came a\ntime when my father, driven by his longing, ventured forth to Ruszark,\nseeking friends to help him regain that place--for these who obey me\nobeyed not him as they obey me; nor would he have marched them--as I\nshall--upon Ruszark if they had obeyed him.\n\n\"Cherkis caught him. And Cherkis waited, knowing well that my mother\nwould follow. For Cherkis knew not where to seek her, nor where they\nhad lain hid, for between his city and here the mountains are great,\nunscalable, and the way through them is cunningly hidden; by chance\nalone did my mother's mother and those who fled with her discover it:\nAnd though they tortured him, my father would not tell. And after a\nwhile forthwith those who still remained of hers stole out with my\nmother to find him. They left me here with Yuruk. And Cherkis caught my\nmother.\"\n\nThe proud breasts heaved, the eyes shot forth visible flames.\n\n\"My father was flayed alive and crucified,\" she said. \"His skin they\nnailed to the City's gates. And when Cherkis had had his will with my\nmother he threw her to his soldiers for their sport.\n\n\"All of those who went with them he tortured and slew--and he and his\nlaughed at their torment. But one there was who escaped and told me--me\nwho was little more than a budding maid. He called on me to bring\nvengeance--and he died. A year passed--and I am not like my mother and\nmy father--and I forgot--dwelling here in the great tranquillities,\nbarred from and having no thought for men and their way.\n\n\"AIE, AIE!\" she cried; \"woe to me that I could forget! But now I shall\ntake my vengeance--I, Norhala, will stamp them flat--Cherkis and his\ncity of Ruszark and everything it holds! I, Norhala, and my servants\nshall stamp them into the rock of their valley so that none shall know\nthat they have been! And would that I could meet their gods with all\ntheir powers that I might break them, too, and stamp them into the rock\nunder the feet of my servants!\"\n\nShe threw out white arms.\n\nWhy had Yuruk lied to me? I wondered as I watched her. The Disk had not\nslain her mother. Of course! He had lied to play upon our terrors; had\nlied to frighten us away.\n\nThe wailings were rising in a sustained crescendo. One of the slaying\nstars slipped over the chamber floor, folded its points and glided out\nthe door.\n\n\"Come!\" commanded Norhala, and led the way. The second star closed,\nfollowed us. We stepped over the threshold.\n\nFor one astounded, breathless moment we paused. In front of us reared a\nmonster--a colossal, headless Sphinx. Like forelegs and paws, a ridge of\npointed cubes, and globes thrust against each side of the canyon walls.\nBetween them for two hundred feet on high stretched the breast.\n\nAnd this was a shifting, weaving mass of the Metal Things; they formed\ninto gigantic cuirasses, giant bucklers, corselets of living mail. From\nthem as they moved--nay, from all the monster--came the wailings. Like a\nheadless Sphinx it crouched--and as we stood it surged forward as though\nit sprang a step to greet us.\n\n\"HAI!\" shouted Norhala, battle buglings ringing through the golden\nvoice. \"HAI! my companies!\"\n\nOut from the summit of the breast shot a tremendous trunk of cubes and\nspinning globes. And like a trunk it nuzzled us, caught us up, swept\nus to the crest. An instant I tottered dizzily; was held; stood beside\nNorhala upon a little, level twinkling eyed platform; upon her other\nside swayed Drake.\n\nNow through the monster I felt a throbbing, an eager and impatient\npulse. I turned my head. Still like some huge and grotesque beast\nthe back of the clustered Things ran for half a mile at least behind,\ntapering to a dragon tail that coiled and twisted another full mile\ntoward the Pit. And from this back uprose and fell immense spiked and\nfan-shaped ruffs, thickets of spikes, whipping knouts of bristling\ntentacles, fanged crests. They thrust and waved, whipped and fell\nconstantly; and constantly the great tail lashed and snapped, fantastic,\nlong and living.\n\n\"HAI!\" shouted Norhala once more. From her lifted throat came again the\ngolden chanting--but now a relentless, ruthless song of slaughter.\n\nUp reared the monstrous bulk. Into it ran the dragon tail. Into it\npoured the fanged and bristling back.\n\nUp, up we were thrust--three hundred feet, four hundred, five hundred.\nOver the blue globe of Norhala's house bent a gigantic leg. Spiderlike\nout from each side of the monster thrust half a score of others.\n\nOverhead the dawn began to break. Through it with ever increasing speed\nwe moved, straight to the line of the cliffs behind which lay the city\nof the armored men--and Ruth and Ventnor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. RUSZARK\n\nSmoothly moved the colossal shape; on it we rode as easily as though\ncradled. It did not glide--it strode.\n\nThe columned legs raised themselves, bending from a thousand joints. The\npedestals of the feet, huge and massive as foundations for sixteen-inch\nguns, fell with machinelike precision, stamping gigantically.\n\nUnder their tread the trees of the forest snapped, were crushed like\nreeds beneath the pads of a mastodon. From far below came the sound of\ntheir crashing. The thick forest checked the progress of the Shape less\nthan tall grass would that of a man.\n\nBehind us our trail was marked by deep, black pits in the forest's\ngreen, clean cut and great as the Mark upon the poppied valley. They\nwere the footprints of the Thing that carried us.\n\nThe wind streamed and whistled. A flock of the willow warblers arose,\nsworled about us with manifold beating of little frightened wings.\nNorhala's face softened, her eyes smiled.\n\n\"Go--foolish little ones,\" she cried, and waved her arms. They flew\naway, scolding.\n\nA lammergeier swooped down on wide funereal wings; it peered at us;\ndarted away toward the cliffs.\n\n\"There will be no carrion there for you, black eater of the dead, when I\nam through,\" I heard Norhala whisper, eyes again somber.\n\nSteadily grew the dawn light; from Norhala's lips came again the\nchanting. And now that paean, the reckless pulse of the monster we rode,\nbegan to creep through my own veins. Into Drake's too, I knew, for his\nhead was held high and his eyes were clear and bright as hers who sang.\n\nThe jubilant pulse streamed through the hands that held us, throbbed\nthrough us. The pulse of the Thing--sang!\n\nCloser and closer grew the cliffs. Down and crashing down fell the\ntrees, the noise of their fall accompanying the battle chant of the\nValkyr beside me like wild harp chords of storm-lashed surf. Up to the\nprecipices the forest rolled, unbroken. Now the cliffs loomed overhead.\nThe dawn had passed. It was full day.\n\nCutting up through the towering granite scarps was a rift. In it the\nblack shadows clustered thickly. Straight toward that cleft we sped.\nAs we drew near, the crest of the Shape began swiftly to lower. Down we\nsank and down--a hundred feet, two hundred; now we were two score yards\nabove the tree tops.\n\nOut shot a neck, a tremendous serpent body. Crested it was with\npyramids; crested with them, too, was its immense head. Thickly the head\nbristled with them, poised motionless upon spinning globes as huge as\nthey. For hundreds of feet that incredible neck stretched ahead of us\nand for twice as far behind a monstrous, lizard-shaped body writhed.\n\nWe rode now upon a serpent, a glittering blue metal dragon, spiked\nand knobbed and scaled. It was the weird steed of Norhala flattening,\nthrusting out to pierce the rift.\n\nAnd still as when it had reared on high beat through it the wild,\ntriumphant, questing pulse. Still rang out Norhala's chanting.\n\nThe trees parted and fell upon each side of us as though we were some\nmonster of the sea and they the waves we cleft.\n\nThe rift enclosed us. Lower we dropped; were not more than fifty feet\nabove its floor. The Thing upon which we rode was a torrent roaring\nthrough it.\n\nA deeper blackness enclosed us--a tunneling.\n\nThrough that we flowed. Out of it we darted into a widening filled with\nwan light drifting down through a pinnacle fanged mouth miles on high.\nAgain the cleft shrunk. A thousand feet ahead was a crack, a narrowing\nof the cleft so small that hardly could a man pass through it.\n\nAbruptly the metal dragon halted.\n\nNorhala's chanting changed; became again the arrogant clarioning. And\nclose below us the huge neck split. It came to me then that it was as\nthough Norhala were the overspirit of this chimera--as though it caught\nand understood and obeyed each quick thought of hers.\n\nAs though, indeed, she was a PART of it--as IT was in reality a part\nof that infinitely greater Thing, crouching there in its lair of the\nPit--the Metal Monster that had lent this living part of itself to her\nfor a steed, a champion. Little time had I to consider such matters.\n\nUp thrust the Shape before us. Into it raced and spun Things angled,\nThings curved and Things squared. It gathered itself into a Titanic\npillar out of which, instantly, thrust scores of arms.\n\nOver them great globes raced; after these flew other scores of huge\npyramids, none less than ten feet in height, the mass of them twenty\nand thirty. The manifold arms grew rigid. Quiet for a moment, a Titanic\nmetal Briareous, it stood.\n\nThen at the tips of the arms the globes began to spin--faster, faster.\nUpon them I saw the hosts of the pyramids open--as one into a host of\nstars. The cleft leaped out in a flood of violet light.\n\nNow for another instant the stars which had been motionless, poised upon\nthe whirling spheres, joined in their mad spinning. Cyclopean pin wheels\nthey turned; again as one they ceased. More brilliant now was their\nlight, dazzling; as though in their whirling they had gathered greater\nforce.\n\nUnder me I felt the split Thing quiver with eagerness.\n\nFrom the stars came a hurricane of lightning! A cataract of electric\nflame poured into the crack, splashed and guttered down the granite\nwalls. We were blinded by it; were deafened with thunders.\n\nThe face of the precipice smoked and split; was whirled away in clouds\nof dust.\n\nThe crack widened--widened as a gulley in a sand bank does when a\nswift stream rushes through it. Lightnings these were--and more than\nlightnings; lightnings keyed up to an invincible annihilating weapon\nthat could rend and split and crumble to atoms the living granite.\n\n\nSteadily the cleft expanded. As its walls melted away the Blasting Thing\nadvanced, spurting into it the flaming torrents. Behind it we crept.\nThe dust of the shattered rocks swirled up toward us like angry\nghosts--before they reached us they were blown away as though by strong\nwinds streaming from beneath us.\n\nOn we went, blinded, deafened. Interminably, it seemed, poured forth the\nhurricane of blue fire; interminably the thunder bellowed.\n\nThere came a louder clamor--volcanic, chaotic, dulling the thunders.\nThe sides of the cleft quivered, bent outward. They split; crashed down.\nBright daylight poured in upon us, a flood of light toward which the\nbillows of dust rushed as though seeking escape; out it poured like the\nsmoke of ten thousand cannon.\n\nAnd the Blasting Thing shook--as though with laughter!\n\nThe stars closed. Back into the Shape ran globe and pyramid. It slid\ntoward us--joined the body from which it had broken away. Through\nall the mass ran a wave of jubilation, a pulse of mirth--a colossal,\nmetallic--SILENT--roar of laughter.\n\nWe glided forward--out of the cleft. I felt a shifting movement.\n\nUp and up we were thrust. Dazed I looked behind me. In the face of a\nsky climbing wall of rock, smoked a wide chasm. Out of it the billowing\nclouds of dust still streamed, pursuing, threatening us. The whole\ngranite barrier seemed to quiver with agony. Higher we rose and higher.\n\n\"Look,\" whispered Drake, and whirled me around.\n\nLess than five miles away was Ruszark, the City of Cherkis. And it was\nlike some ancient city come into life out of long dead centuries. A\npage restored from once conquering Persia's crumbled book. A city of the\nChosroes transported by Jinns into our own time.\n\nBuilt around and upon a low mount, it stood within a valley but little\nlarger than the Pit. The plain was level, as though once it had been\nthe floor of some primeval lake; the hill of the City was its only\nelevation.\n\nBeyond, I caught the glinting of a narrow stream, meandering. The valley\nwas ringed with precipitous cliffs falling sheer to its floor.\n\nSlowly we advanced.\n\nThe city was almost square, guarded by double walls of hewn stone. The\nfirst raised itself a hundred feet on high, turreted and parapeted and\npierced with gates. Perhaps a quarter of a mile behind it the second\nfortification thrust up.\n\nThe city itself I estimated covered about ten square miles. It ran\nupward in broad terraces. It was very fair, decked with blossoming\ngardens and green groves. Among the clustering granite houses, red and\nyellow roofed, thrust skyward tall spires and towers. Upon the mount's\ntop was a broad, flat plaza on which were great buildings, marble white\nand golden roofed; temples I thought, or palaces, or both.\n\nRunning to the city out of the grain fields and steads that surrounded\nit, were scores of little figures, rat-like. Here and there among them\nI glimpsed horsemen, arms and armor glittering. All were racing to the\ngates and the shelter of the battlements.\n\nNearer we drew. From the walls came now a faint sound of gongs, of\ndrums, of shrill, flutelike pipings. Upon them I could see hosts\ngathering; hosts of swarming little figures whose bodies glistened, from\nabove whom came gleamings--the light striking upon their helms, their\nspear and javelin tips.\n\n\"Ruszark!\" breathed Norhala, eyes wide, red lips cruelly smiling. \"Lo--I\nam before your gates. Lo--I am here--and was there ever joy like this!\"\n\nThe constellations in her eyes blazed. Beautiful, beautiful was\nNorhala--as Isis punishing Typhon for the murder of Osiris; as avenging\nDiana; shining from her something of the spirit of all wrathful\nGoddesses.\n\nThe flaming hair whirled and snapped. From all her sweet body came\nwhite-hot furious force, a withering perfume of destruction. She pressed\nagainst me, and I trembled at the contact.\n\n\nLawless, wild imaginings ran through me. Life, human life, dwindled. The\nCity seemed but a thing of toys.\n\nOn--let us crush it! On--on!\n\nAgain the monster shook beneath us. Faster we moved. Louder grew the\nclangor of the drums, the gongs, the pipes. Nearer came the walls; and\never more crowded with the swarming human ants that manned them.\n\nWe were close upon the heels of the last fleeing stragglers. The Thing\nslackened in its stride; waited patiently until they were close to the\ngates. Before they could reach them I heard the brazen clanging of their\nvalves. Those shut out beat frenziedly upon them; dragged themselves\nclose to the base of the battlements, cowered there or crept along them\nseeking some hole in which to hide.\n\nWith a slow lowering of its height the Thing advanced. Now its form was\nthat of a spindle a full mile in length on whose bulging center we three\nstood.\n\nA hundred feet from the outer wall we halted. We looked down upon it not\nmore than fifty feet above its broad top. Hundreds of the soldiers were\ncrouching behind the parapets, companies of archers with great bows\npoised, arrows at their cheeks, scores of leather jerkined men with\nstands of javelins at their right hands, spearsmen and men with long,\nthonged slings.\n\nSet at intervals were squat, powerful engines of wood and metal beside\nwhich were heaps of huge, rounded boulders. Catapults I knew them to be\nand around each swarmed a knot of soldiers, fixing the great stones in\nplace, drawing back the thick ropes that, loosened, would hurl forth\nthe projectiles. From each side came other men, dragging more of these\nbalisters; assembling a battery against the prodigious, gleaming monster\nthat menaced their city.\n\nBetween outer wall and inner battlements galloped squadrons of mounted\nmen. Upon this inner wall the soldiers clustered as thickly as on the\nouter, preparing as actively for its defense.\n\nThe city seethed. Up from it arose a humming, a buzzing, as of some\nimmense angry hive.\n\nInvoluntarily I visualized the spectacle we must present to those\nwho looked upon us--this huge incredible Shape of metal alive with\nquicksilver shifting. This--as it must have seemed to them--hellish\nmechanism of war captained by a sorceress and two familiars in form of\nmen. There came to me dreadful visions of such a monster looking\ndown upon the peace-reared battlements of New York--the panic rush of\nthousands away from it.\n\nThere was a blaring of trumpets. Up on the parapet leaped a man clad all\nin gleaming red armor. From head to feet the close linked scales covered\nhim. Within a hood shaped somewhat like the tight-fitting head coverings\nof the Crusaders a pallid, cruel face looked out upon us; in the fierce\nblack eyes was no trace of fear.\n\nEvil as Norhala had said these people of Ruszark were, wicked and\ncruel--they were no cowards, no!\n\nThe red armored man threw up a hand.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he shouted. \"Who are you three, you three who come\ndriving down upon Ruszark through the rocks? We have no quarrel with\nyou?\"\n\n\"I seek a man and a maid,\" cried Norhala. \"A maid and a sick man your\nthieves took from me. Bring him forth!\"\n\n\"Seek elsewhere for them then,\" he answered. \"They are not here. Turn\nnow and seek elsewhere. Go quickly, lest I loose our might upon you and\nyou go never.\"\n\nMockingly rang her laughter--and under its lash the black eyes grew\nfiercer, the cruelty on the white face darkened.\n\n\"Little man whose words are so big! Fly who thunders! What are you\ncalled, little man?\"\n\nHer raillery bit deep--but its menace passed unheeded in the rage it\ncalled forth.\n\n\"I am Kulun,\" shouted the man in scarlet armor. \"Kulun, the son of\nCherkis the Mighty, and captain of his hosts. Kulun--who will cast your\nskin under my mares in stall for them to trample and thrust your red\nflayed body upon a pole in the grain fields to frighten away the crows!\nDoes that answer you?\"\n\nHer laughter ceased; her eyes dwelt upon him--filled with an infernal\njoy.\n\n\"The son of Cherkis!\" I heard her murmur. \"He has a son--\"\n\nThere was a sneer on the cruel face; clearly he thought her awed. Quick\nwas his disillusionment.\n\n\"Listen, Kulun,\" she cried. \"I am Norhala--daughter of another Norhala\nand of Rustum, whom Cherkis tortured and slew. Now go, you lying spawn\nof unclean toads--go and tell your father that I, Norhala, am at his\ngates. And bring back with you the maid and the man. Go, I say!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. CHERKIS\n\nThere was stark amazement on Kulun's face; and fear now enough. He\ndropped from the parapet among his men. There came one loud trumpet\nblast.\n\nOut from the battlements poured a storm of arrows, a cloud of javelins.\nThe squat catapults leaped forward. From them came a hail of boulders.\nBefore that onrushing tempest of death I flinched.\n\nI heard Norhala's golden laughter and before they could reach us arrow\nand javelin and boulder were checked as though myriads of hands reached\nout from the Thing under us and caught them. Down they dropped.\n\nForth from the great spindle shot a gigantic arm, hammer tipped with\ncubes. It struck the wall close to where the scarlet armored Kulun had\nvanished.\n\nUnder its blow the stones crumbled. With the fragments fell the\nsoldiers; were buried beneath them.\n\nA hundred feet in width a breach gaped in the battlements. Out shot the\narm again; hooked its hammer tip over the parapet, tore away a stretch\nof the breastwork as though it had been cardboard. Beside the breach an\nexpanse of the broad flat top lay open like a wide platform.\n\nThe arm withdrew, and out from the whole length of the spindle thrust\nother arms, hammer tipped, held high aloft, menacing.\n\nFrom all the length of the wall arose panic outcry. Abruptly the storm\nof arrows ended; the catapults were still. Again the trumpets sounded;\nthe crying ceased. Down fell a silence, terrified, stifling.\n\nKulun stepped forth again, both hands held high. Gone was his arrogance.\n\n\"A parley,\" he shouted. \"A parley, Norhala. If we give you the maid and\nman, will you go?\"\n\n\"Go get them,\" she answered. \"And take with you this my command to\nCherkis--that HE return with the two!\"\n\nFor an instant Kulun hesitated. Up thrust the dreadful arms, poised\nthemselves to strike.\n\n\"It shall be so,\" he shouted. \"I carry your command.\"\n\nHe leaped back, his red mail flashed toward a turret that held, I\nsupposed, a stairway. He was lost to sight. In silence we waited.\n\nOn the further side of the city I glimpsed movement. Little troops of\nmounted men, pony drawn wains, knots of running figures were fleeing\nfrom the city through the opposite gates.\n\nNorhala saw them too. With that incomprehensible, instant obedience\nto her unspoken thought a mass of the Metal Things separated from us;\nwhirled up into a dozen of those obelisked forms I had seen march from\nthe cat eyes of the City of the Pit.\n\nIn but a breath, it seemed, their columns were far off, herding back the\nfugitives.\n\nThey did not touch them, did not offer to harm--only, grotesquely,\nlike dogs heading off and corraling frightened sheep, they circled and\ndarted. Rushing back came those they herded.\n\nFrom the watching terraces and walls arose shrill cries of terror, a\nwailing. Far away the obelisks met, pirouetted, melted into one thick\ncolumn. Towering, motionless as we, it stood, guarding the further\ngates.\n\nThere was a stir upon the wall, a flashing of spears, of drawn blades.\nTwo litters closed with curtainings, surrounded by triple rows of\nswordsmen fully armored, carrying small shields and led by Kulun were\nbeing borne to the torn battlement.\n\nTheir bearers stopped well within the platform and gently lowered their\nburdens. The leader of those around the second litter drew aside its\ncovering, spoke.\n\nOut stepped Ruth and after her--Ventnor!\n\n\"Martin!\" I could not keep back the cry; heard mingled with it Drake's\nown cry to Ruth. Ventnor raised his hand in greeting; I thought he\nsmiled.\n\nThe cubes on which we stood shot forward; stopped within fifty feet of\nthem. Instantly the guard of swordsmen raised their blades, held them\nover the pair as though waiting the signal to strike.\n\nAnd now I saw that Ruth was not clad as she had been when we had left\nher. She stood in scanty kirtle that came scarcely to her knees, her\nshoulders were bare, her curly brown hair unbound and tangled. Her face\nwas set with wrath hardly less than that which beat from Norhala. On\nVentnor's forehead was a blood red scar, a line that ran from temple to\ntemple like a brand.\n\nThe curtains of the first litter quivered; behind them someone spoke.\nThat in which Ruth and Ventnor had ridden was drawn swiftly away. The\nknot of swordsmen drew back.\n\nInto their places sprang and knelt a dozen archers. They ringed in the\ntwo, bows drawn taut, arrows in place and pointing straight to their\nhearts.\n\nOut of the litter rolled a giant of a man. Seven feet he must have been\nin height; over the huge shoulders, the barreled chest and the bloated\nabdomen hung a purple cloak glittering with gems; through the thick and\ngrizzled hair passed a flashing circlet of jewels.\n\nThe scarlet armored Kulun beside him, swordsmen guarding them, he walked\nto the verge of the torn gap in the wall. He peered down it, glancing\nimperturbably at the upraised, hammer-banded arms still threatening;\nexamined again the breach. Then still with Kulun he strode over to\nthe very edge of the broken battlement and stood, head thrust a little\nforward, studying us in silence.\n\n\n\"Cherkis!\" whispered Norhala--the whisper was a hymn to Nemesis. I felt\nher body quiver from head to foot.\n\nA wave of hatred, a hot desire to kill, passed through me as I scanned\nthe face staring at us. It was a great gross mask of evil, of cold\ncruelty and callous lusts. Unwinking, icily malignant, black slits of\neyes glared at us between pouches that held them half closed. Heavy\njowls hung pendulous, dragging down the corners of the thick lipped,\nbrutal mouth into a deep graven, unchanging sneer.\n\nAs he gazed at Norhala a flicker of lust shot like a licking tongue\nthrough his eyes.\n\nYet from him pulsed power; sinister, instinct with evil, concentrate\nwith cruelty--but power indomitable. Such was Cherkis, descendant\nperhaps of that Xerxes the Conqueror who three millenniums gone ruled\nmost of the known world.\n\nIt was Norhala who broke the silence.\n\n\"Tcherak! Greeting--Cherkis!\" There was merciless mirth in the buglings\nof her voice. \"Lo, I did but knock so gently at your gates and you\nhastened to welcome me. Greetings--gross swine, spittle of the toads,\nfat slug beneath my sandals.\"\n\nHe passed the insults by, unmoved--although I heard a murmuring go up\nfrom those near and Kulun's hard eyes blazed.\n\n\"We will bargain, Norhala,\" he answered calmly; the voice was deep,\nfilled with sinister strength.\n\n\"Bargain?\" she laughed. \"What have you with which to bargain, Cherkis?\nDoes the rat bargain with the tigress? And you, toad, have nothing.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I have these,\" he waved a hand toward Ruth and her brother. \"Me you may\nslay--and mayhap many of mine. But before you can move my archers will\nfeather their hearts.\"\n\nShe considered him, no longer mocking.\n\n\"Two of mine you slew long since, Cherkis,\" she said, slowly. \"Therefore\nit is I am here.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he nodded heavily. \"Yet now that is neither here nor there,\nNorhala. It was long since, and I have learned much during the years.\nI would have killed you too, Norhala, could I have found you. But now I\nwould not do as then--quite differently would I do, Norhala; for I have\nlearned much. I am sorry that those that you loved died as they did. I\nam in truth sorry!\"\n\nThere was a curious lurking sardonicism in the words, an undertone of\nmockery. Was what he really meant that in those years he had learned\nto inflict greater agonies, more exquisite tortures? If so, Norhala\napparently did not sense that interpretation. Indeed, she seemed to be\ninterested, her wrath abating.\n\n\"No,\" the hoarse voice rumbled dispassionately. \"None of that is\nimportant--now. YOU would have this man and girl. I hold them. They die\nif you stir a hand's breadth toward me. If they die, I prevail against\nyou--for I have cheated you of what you desire. I win, Norhala, even\nthough you slay me. That is all that is now important.\"\n\nThere was doubt upon Norhala's face and I caught a quick gleam of\ncontemptuous triumph glint through the depths of the evil eyes.\n\n\"Empty will be your victory over me, Norhala,\" he said; then waited.\n\n\"What is your bargain?\" she spoke hesitatingly; with a sinking of my\nheart I heard the doubt tremble in her throat.\n\n\"If you will go without further knocking upon my gates\"--there was a\nsatiric grimness in the phrase--\"go when you have been given them, and\npledge yourself never to return--you shall have them. If you will not,\nthen they die.\"\n\n\"But what security, what hostages, do you ask?\" Her eyes were troubled.\n\"I cannot swear by your gods, Cherkis, for they are not my gods--in\ntruth I, Norhala, have no gods. Why should I not say yes and take the\ntwo, then fall upon you and destroy--as you would do in my place, old\nwolf?\"\n\n\"Norhala,\" he answered, \"I ask nothing but your word. Do I not know\nthose who bore you and the line from which they sprung? Was not always\nthe word they gave kept till death--unbroken, inviolable? No need\nfor vows to gods between you and me. Your word is holier than they--O\nglorious daughter of kings, princess royal!\"\n\n\nThe great voice was harshly caressing; not obsequious, but as though\nhe gave her as an equal her rightful honor. Her face softened; she\nconsidered him from eyes far less hostile.\n\nA wholesome respect for this gross tyrant's mentality came to me; it\ndid not temper, it heightened, the hatred I felt for him. But now I\nrecognized the subtlety of his attack; realized that unerringly he\nhad taken the only means by which he could have gained a hearing; have\ntemporized. Could he win her with his guile?\n\n\"Is it not true?\" There was a leonine purring in the question.\n\n\"It IS true!\" she answered proudly. \"Though why YOU should dwell upon\nthis, Cherkis, whose word is steadfast as the running stream and whose\npromises are as lasting as its bubbles--why YOU should dwell on this I\ndo not know.\"\n\n\"I have changed greatly, Princess, in the years since my great\nwickedness; I have learned much. He who speaks to you now is not he you\nwere taught--and taught justly then--to hate.\"\n\n\"You may speak truth! Certainly you are not as I have pictured you.\" It\nwas as though she were more than half convinced. \"In this at least you\ndo speak truth--that IF I promise I will go and molest you no more.\"\n\n\"Why go at all, Princess?\" Quietly he asked the amazing question--then\ndrew himself to his full height, threw wide his arms.\n\n\"Princess?\" the great voice rumbled forth. \"Nay--Queen! Why leave us\nagain--Norhala the Queen? Are we not of your people? Am I not of your\nkin? Join your power with ours. What that war engine you ride may be,\nhow built, I know not. But this I do know--that with our strengths\njoined we two can go forth from where I have dwelt so long, go forth\ninto the forgotten world, eat its cities and rule.\n\n\"You shall teach our people to make these engines, Norhala, and we will\nmake many of them. Queen Norhala--you shall wed my son Kulun, he who\nstands beside me. And while I live you shall rule with me, rule equally.\nAnd when I die you and Kulun shall rule.\n\n\"Thus shall our two royal lines be made one, the old feud wiped out, the\nlong score be settled. Queen--wherever it is you dwell it comes to\nme that you have few men. Queen--you need men, many men and strong to\nfollow you, men to gather the harvests of your power, men to bring to\nyou the fruit of your smallest wish--young men and vigorous to amuse\nyou.\n\n\"Let the past be forgotten--I too have wrongs to forget, O Queen. Come\nto us, Great One, with your power and your beauty. Teach us. Lead us.\nReturn, and throned above your people rule the world!\"\n\nHe ceased. Over the battlements, over the city, dropped a vast expectant\nsilence--as though the city knew its fate was hanging upon the balance.\n\n\"No! No!\" It was Ruth crying. \"Do not trust him, Norhala! It's a trap!\nHe shamed me--he tortured--\"\n\nCherkis half turned; before he swung about I saw a hell shadow darken\nhis face. Ventnor's hand thrust out, covered Ruth's mouth, choking her\ncrying.\n\n\"Your son\"--Norhala spoke swiftly; and back flashed the cruel face of\nCherkis, devouring her with his eyes. \"Your son--and Queenship here--and\nEmpire of the World.\" Her voice was rapt, thrilled. \"All this you offer?\nMe--Norhala?\"\n\n\"This and more!\" The huge bulk of his body quivered with eagerness. \"If\nit be your wish, O Queen, I, Cherkis, will step down from the throne for\nyou and sit beneath your right hand, eager to do your bidding.\"\n\nA moment she studied him.\n\n\"Norhala,\" I whispered, \"do not do this thing. He thinks to gain your\nsecrets.\"\n\n\"Let my bridegroom stand forth that I may look upon him,\" called\nNorhala.\n\nVisibly Cherkis relaxed, as though a strain had been withdrawn. Between\nhim and his crimson-clad son flashed a glance; it was as though a\ntriumphant devil sped from them into each other's eyes.\n\nI saw Ruth shrink into Ventnor's arms. Up from the wall rose a jubilant\nshouting, was caught by the inner battlements, passed on to the crowded\nterraces.\n\n\"Take Kulun,\" it was Drake, pistol drawn and whispering across to me.\n\"I'll handle Cherkis. And shoot straight.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. THE VENGEANCE OF NORHALA\n\nNorhala's hand that had gone from my wrist dropped down again; the other\nfell upon Drake's.\n\nKulun loosed his hood, let it fall about his shoulders.\n\nHe stepped forward, held out his arms to Norhala.\n\n\"A strong man!\" she cried approvingly. \"Hail--my bridegroom! But\nstay--stand back a moment. Stand beside that man for whom I came to\nRuszark. I would see you together!\"\n\nKulun's face darkened. But Cherkis smiled with evil understanding,\nshrugged his shoulders and whispered to him. Sullenly Kulun stepped\nback. The ring of the archers lowered their bows; they leaped to their\nfeet and stood aside to let him pass.\n\nQuick as a serpent's tongue a pyramid tipped tentacle flicked out\nbeneath us. It darted through the broken circle of the bowmen.\n\nIt LICKED up Ruth and Ventnor and--Kulun!\n\nSwiftly as it had swept forth it returned, coiled and dropped those two\nI loved at Norhala's feet.\n\nIt flashed back on high with the scarlet length of Cherkis's son\nsprawled along its angled end.\n\nThe great body of Cherkis seemed to wither.\n\nUp from all the wall went a tempestuous sigh of horror.\n\nOut rang the merciless chimes of Norhala's laughter.\n\n\"Tchai!\" she cried. \"Tchai! Fat fool there. Tchai--you Cherkis! Toad\nwhose wits have sickened with your years!\n\n\"Did you think to catch me, Norhala, in your filthy web? Princess!\nQueen! Empress of Earth! Ho--old fox I have outplayed and beaten, what\nnow have you to trade with Norhala?\"\n\nMouth sagging open, eyes glaring, the tyrant slowly raised his arms--a\nsuppliant.\n\n\"You would have back the bridegroom you gave me?\" she laughed. \"Take\nhim, then.\"\n\nDown swept the metal arm that held Kulun. The arm dropped Cherkis's son\nat Cherkis's feet; and as though Kulun had been a grape--it crushed him!\n\nBefore those who had seen could stir from their stupor the tentacle\nhovered over Cherkis, glaring down at the horror that had been his son.\n\nIt did not strike him--it drew him up to it as a magnet draws a pin.\n\nAnd as the pin swings from the magnet when held suspended by the head,\nso swung the great body of Cherkis from the under side of the pyramid\nthat held him. Hanging so he was carried toward us, came to a stop not\nten feet from us--\n\nWeird, weird beyond all telling was that scene--and would I had the\npower to make you who read see it as we did.\n\nThe animate, living Shape of metal on which we stood, with its forest of\nhammer-handed arms raised menacingly along its mile of spindled length;\nthe great walls glistening with the armored hosts; the terraces of that\nfair and ancient city, their gardens and green groves and clustering\nred and yellow-roofed houses and temples and palaces; the swinging gross\nbody of Cherkis in the clutch of the unseen grip of the tentacle, his\ngrizzled hair touching the side of the pyramid that held him, his arms\nhalf outstretched, the gemmed cloak flapping like the wings of a jeweled\nbat, his white, malignant face in which the evil eyes were burning slits\nflaming hell's own blackest hatred; and beyond the city, from which\npulsed almost visibly a vast and hopeless horror, the watching\ncolumn--and over all this the palely radiant white sky under whose light\nthe encircling cliffs were tremendous stony palettes splashed with a\nhundred pigments.\n\nNorhala's laughter had ceased. Somberly she looked upon Cherkis, into\nthe devil fires of his eyes.\n\n\"Cherkis!\" she half whispered. \"Now comes the end for you--and for all\nthat is yours! But until the end's end you shall see.\"\n\nThe hanging body was thrust forward; was thrust up; was brought down\nupon its feet on the upper plane of the prostrate pyramid tipping the\nmetal arm that held him. For an instant he struggled to escape; I\nthink he meant to hurl himself down upon Norhala, to kill her before he\nhimself was slain.\n\nIf so, after one frenzied effort he realized the futility, for with\na certain dignity he drew himself upright, turned his eyes toward the\ncity.\n\nOver that city a dreadful silence hung. It was as though it cowered, hid\nits face, was afraid to breathe.\n\n\"The end!\" murmured Norhala.\n\nThere was a quick trembling through the Metal Thing. Down swung its\nforest of sledges. Beneath the blow down fell the smitten walls,\nshattered, crumbling, and with it glittering like shining flies in a\ndust storm fell the armored men.\n\nThrough that mile-wide breach and up to the inner barrier I glimpsed\nconfusion chaotic. And again I say it--they were no cowards, those men\nof Cherkis. From the inner battlements flew clouds of arrows, of huge\nstones--as uselessly as before.\n\nThen out from the opened gates poured regiments of horsemen, brandishing\njavelins and great maces, and shouting fiercely as they drove down upon\neach end of the Metal Shape. Under cover of their attack I saw cloaked\nriders spurring their ponies across the plain to shelter of the cliff\nwalls, to the chance of hiding places within them. Women and men of\nthe rich, the powerful, flying for safety; after them ran and scattered\nthrough the fields of grain a multitude on foot.\n\n\nThe ends of the spindle drew back before the horsemen's charge,\nbroadening as they went--like the heads of monstrous cobras withdrawing\ninto their hoods. Abruptly, with a lightning velocity, these broadenings\nexpanded into immense lunettes, two tremendous curving and crablike\nclaws. Their tips flung themselves past the racing troops; then like\ngigantic pincers began to contract.\n\nOf no avail now was it for the horsemen to halt dragging their mounts on\ntheir haunches, or to turn to fly. The ends of the lunettes had met,\nthe pincer tips had closed. The mounted men were trapped within\nhalf-mile-wide circles. And in upon man and horse their living\nwalls marched. Within those enclosures of the doomed began a frantic\nmilling--I shut my eyes--\n\nThere was a dreadful screaming of horses, a shrieking of men. Then\nsilence.\n\nShuddering, I looked. Where the mounted men had been was--nothing.\n\nNothing? There were two great circular spaces whose floors were\nglistening, wetly red. Fragments of man or horse--there was none.\nThey had been crushed into--what was it Norhala had promised--had been\nstamped into the rock beneath the feet of her--servants.\n\nSick, I looked away and stared at a Thing that writhed and undulated\nover the plain; a prodigious serpentine Shape of cubes and spheres\nlinked and studded thick with the spikes of the pyramid. Through the\nfields, over the plain its coils flashed.\n\nPlayfully it sped and twisted among the fugitives, crushing them,\ntossing them aside broken, gliding over them. Some there were who\nhurled themselves upon it in impotent despair, some who knelt before it,\npraying. On rolled the metal convolutions, inexorable.\n\nWithin my vision's range there were no more fugitives. Around a corner\nof the broken battlements raced the serpent Shape. Where it had writhed\nwas now no waving grain, no trees, no green thing. There was only smooth\nrock upon which here and there red smears glistened wetly.\n\nAfar there was a crying, in its wake a rumbling. It was the column, it\ncame to me, at work upon the further battlements. As though the sound\nhad been a signal the spindle trembled; up we were thrust another\nhundred feet or more. Back dropped the host of brandished arms, threaded\nthemselves into the parent bulk.\n\nRight and left of us the spindle split into scores of fissures. Between\nthese fissures the Metal Things that made up each now dissociate and\nshapeless mass geysered; block and sphere and tetrahedron spike spun and\nswirled. There was an instant of formlessness.\n\nThen right and left of us stood scores of giant, grotesque warriors.\nTheir crests were fully fifty feet below our living platform. They\nstood upon six immense, columnar stilts. These sextuple legs supported\na hundred feet above their bases a huge and globular body formed of\nclusters of the spheres. Out from each of these bodies that were at one\nand the same time trunks and heads, sprang half a score of colossal arms\nshaped like flails; like spike-studded girders, Titanic battle maces,\nCyclopean sledges.\n\nFrom legs and trunks and arms the tiny eyes of the Metal Hordes flashed,\nexulting.\n\nThere came from them, from the Thing we rode as well, a chorus of thin\nand eager wailings and pulsed through all that battle-line, a jubilant\nthrobbing.\n\nThen with a rhythmic, JOCUND stride they leaped upon the city.\n\nUnder the mallets of the smiting arms the inner battlements fell as\nunder the hammers of a thousand metal Thors. Over their fragments and\nthe armored men who fell with them strode the Things, grinding stone and\nman together as we passed.\n\nAll of the terraced city except the side hidden by the mount lay open to\nmy gaze. In that brief moment of pause I saw crazed crowds battling\nin narrow streets, trampling over mounds of the fallen, surging over\nbarricades of bodies, clawing and tearing at each other in their flight.\n\nThere was a wide, stepped street of gleaming white stone that climbed\nlike an immense stairway straight up the slope to that broad plaza at\nthe top where clustered the great temples and palaces--the Acropolis of\nthe city. Into it the streets of the terraces flowed, each pouring out\nupon it a living torrent, tumultuous with tuliped, sparkling little\nwaves, the gay coverings and the arms and armor of Ruszark's desperate\nthousands seeking safety at the shrines of their gods.\n\nHere great carven arches arose; there slender, exquisite towers capped\nwith red gold--there was a street of colossal statues, another over\nwhich dozens of graceful, fretted bridges threw their spans from\nfeathery billows of flowering trees; there were gardens gay with\nblossoms in which fountains sparkled, green groves; thousands upon\nthousands of bright multicolored pennants, banners, fluttered.\n\nA fair, a lovely city was Cherkis's stronghold of Ruszark.\n\nIts beauty filled the eyes; out from it streamed the fragrance of its\ngardens--the voice of its agony was that of the souls in Dis.\n\nThe row of destroying shapes lengthened, each huge warrior of metal\ndrawing far apart from its mates. They flexed their manifold arms,\nshadow boxed--grotesquely, dreadfully.\n\nDown struck the flails, the sledges. Beneath the blows the buildings\nburst like eggshells, their fragments burying the throngs fighting for\nescape in the thoroughfares that threaded them. Over their ruins we\nmoved.\n\nDown and ever down crashed the awful sledges. And ever under them the\ncity crumbled.\n\nThere was a spider Shape that crawled up the wide stairway hammering\ninto the stone those who tried to flee before it.\n\nStride by stride the Destroying Things ate up the city.\n\n\nI felt neither wrath nor pity. Through me beat a jubilant roaring\npulse--as though I were a shouting corpuscle of the rushing hurricane,\nas though I were one of the hosts of smiting spirits of the bellowing\ntyphoon.\n\nThrough this stole another thought--vague, unfamiliar, yet seemingly\nof truth's own essence. Why, I wondered, had I never recognized this\nbefore? Why had I never known that these green forms called trees were\nbut ugly, unsymmetrical excrescences? That these high projections of\ntowers, these buildings were deformities?\n\nThat these four-pronged, moving little shapes that screamed and ran\nwere--hideous?\n\nThey must be wiped out! All this misshapen, jumbled, inharmonious\nugliness must be wiped out! It must be ground down to smooth unbroken\nplanes, harmonious curvings, shapeliness--harmonies of arc and line and\nangle!\n\nSomething deep within me fought to speak--fought to tell me that this\nthought was not human thought, not my thought--that it was the reflected\nthought of the Metal Things!\n\nIt told me--and fiercely it struggled to make me realize what it was\nthat it told. Its insistence was borne upon little despairing, rhythmic\nbeatings--throbbings that were like the muffled sobbings of the drums of\ngrief. Louder, closer came the throbbing; clearer with it my perception\nof the inhumanness of my thought.\n\nThe drum beat tapped at my humanity, became a dolorous knocking at my\nheart.\n\nIt was the sobbing of Cherkis!\n\nThe gross face was shrunken, the cheeks sagging in folds of woe; cruelty\nand wickedness were wiped from it; the evil in the eyes had been washed\nout by tears. Eyes streaming, bull throat and barrel chest racked by his\nsobbing, he watched the passing of his people and his city.\n\nAnd relentlessly, coldly, Norhala watched him--as though loath to lose\nthe faintest shadow of his agony.\n\nNow I saw we were close to the top of the mount. Packed between us\nand the immense white structures that crowned it were thousands of the\npeople. They fell on their knees before us, prayed to us. They tore at\neach other, striving to hide themselves from us in the mass that was\nthemselves. They beat against the barred doors of the sanctuaries; they\nclimbed the pillars; they swarmed over the golden roofs.\n\nThere was a moment of chaos--a chaos of which we were the heart.\nThen temple and palace cracked, burst; were shattered; fell. I caught\nglimpses of gleaming sculptures, glitterings of gold and of silver,\nflashing of gems, shimmering of gorgeous draperies--under them a\nweltering of men and women.\n\nWe closed down upon them--over them!\n\nThe dreadful sobbing ceased. I saw the head of Cherkis swing heavily\nupon a shoulder; the eyes closed.\n\nThe Destroying Things touched. Their flailing arms coiled back, withdrew\ninto their bodies. They joined, forming for an instant a tremendous\nhollow pillar far down in whose center we stood. They parted; shifted\nin shape? rolled down the mount over the ruins like a widening\nwave--crushing into the stone all over which they passed.\n\nAfar away I saw the gleaming serpent still at play--still writhing\nalong, still obliterating the few score scattered fugitives that some\nway, somehow, had slipped by the Destroying Things.\n\nWe halted. For one long moment Norhala looked upon the drooping body of\nhim upon whom she had let fall this mighty vengeance.\n\nThen the metal arm that held Cherkis whirled. Thrown from it, the\ncloaked form flew like a great blue bat. It fell upon the flattened\nmound that had once been the proud crown of his city. A blue blot upon\ndesolation the broken body of Cherkis lay.\n\nA black speck appeared high in the sky; grew fast--the lammergeier.\n\n\"I have left carrion for you--after all!\" cried Norhala.\n\nWith an ebon swirling of wings the vulture dropped beside the blue\nheap--thrust in it its beak.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. \"THE DRUMS OF DESTINY\"\n\nSlowly we descended that mount of desolation; lingeringly, as though the\nbrooding eyes of Norhala were not yet sated with destruction. Of human\nlife, of green life, of life of any kind there was none.\n\nMan and tree, woman and flower, babe and bud, palace, temple and\nhome--Norhala had stamped flat. She had crushed them within the\nrock--even as she had promised.\n\nThe tremendous tragedy had absorbed my every faculty; I had had no time\nto think of my companions; I had forgotten them. Now in the painful\nsurges of awakening realization, of full human understanding of that\ninhuman annihilation, I turned to them for strength. Faintly I wondered\nagain at Ruth's scantiness of garb, her more than half nudity; dwelt\ncuriously upon the red brand across Ventnor's forehead.\n\nIn his eyes and in Drake's I saw reflected the horror I knew was in\nmy own. But in the eyes of Ruth was none of this--sternly, coldly\ntriumphant, indifferent to its piteousness as Norhala herself, she\nscanned the waste that less than an hour since had been a place of\nliving beauty.\n\nI felt a shock of repulsion. After all, those who had been destroyed\nso ruthlessly could not ALL have been wholly evil. Yet mother and\nblossoming maid, youth and oldster, all the pageant of humanity within\nthe great walls were now but lines within the stone. According to their\ndifferent lights, it came to me, there had been in Ruszark no greater\nnumber of the wicked than one could find in any great city of our own\ncivilization.\n\nFrom Norhala, of course, I looked for no perception of any of this. But\nfrom Ruth--\n\nMy reaction grew; the pity long withheld racing through me linked with\na burning anger, a hatred for this woman who had been the directing soul\nof that catastrophe.\n\nMy gaze fell again upon the red brand. I saw that it was a deep\nindentation as though a thong had been twisted around Ventnor's head\nbiting the bone. There was dried blood on the edges, a double ring of\nswollen white flesh rimming the cincture. It was the mark of--torture!\n\n\"Martin,\" I cried. \"That ring? What did they do to you?\"\n\n\"They waked me with that,\" he answered quietly. \"I suppose I ought to be\ngrateful--although their intentions were not exactly--therapeutic--\"\n\n\"They tortured him,\" Ruth's voice was tense, bitter; she spoke in\nPersian--for Norhala's benefit I thought then, not guessing a deeper\nreason. \"They tortured him. They gave him agony until he--returned. And\nthey promised him other agonies that would make him pray long for death.\n\n\"And me--me\"--she raised little clenched hands--\"me they stripped like a\nslave. They led me through the city and the people mocked me. They\ntook me before that swine Norhala has punished--and stripped me\nbefore him--like a slave. Before my eyes they tortured my brother.\nNorhala--they were evil, all evil! Norhala--you did well to slay them!\"\n\nShe caught the woman's hands, pressed close to her. Norhala gazed at her\nfrom great gray eyes in which the wrath was dying, into which the old\ntranquillity, the old serenity was flowing. And when she spoke the\ngolden voice held more than returning echoes of the far-away, faint\nchimings.\n\n\"It is done,\" she said. \"And it was well done--sister. Now you and I\nshall dwell together in peace--sister. Or if there be those in the world\nfrom which you came that you would have slain, then you and I shall go\nforth with our companies and stamp them out--even as I did these.\"\n\nMy heart stopped beating--for from the depths of Ruth's eyes shining\nshadows were rising, wraiths answering Norhala's calling; and, as they\nrose, steadily they drew life from the clear radiance summoning--drew\ncloser to the semblance of that tranquil spirit which her vengeance\nhad banished but that had now returned to its twin thrones of Norhala's\neyes.\n\nAnd at last it was twin sister of Norhala who looked upon her from the\nface of Ruth!\n\nThe white arms of the woman encircled her; the glorious head bent over\nher; flaming tresses mingled with tender brown curls.\n\n\"Sister!\" she whispered. \"Little sister! These men you shall have as\nlong as it pleases you--to do with as you will. Or if it is your wish\nthey shall go back to their world and I will guard them to its gates.\n\n\"But you and I, little sister, will dwell together--in the\nvastnesses--in the peace. Shall it not be so?\"\n\nWith no faltering, with no glance toward us three--lover, brother, old\nfriend--Ruth crept closer to her, rested her head upon the virginal,\nroyal breasts.\n\n\"It shall be so!\" she murmured. \"Sister--it shall be so. Norhala--I am\ntired. Norhala--I have seen enough of men.\"\n\nAn ecstasy of tenderness, a flame of unearthly rapture, trembled over\nthe woman's wondrous face. Hungrily, defiantly, she pressed the girl to\nher; the stars in the lucid heavens of her eyes were soft and gentle and\ncaressing.\n\n\"Ruth!\" cried Drake--and sprang toward them. She paid no heed; and even\nas he leaped he was caught, whirled back against us.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Ventnor, and caught him by the arm as wrathfully,\nblindedly, he strove against the force that held him. \"Wait. No\nuse--now.\"\n\nThere was a curious understanding in his voice--a curious sympathy,\ntoo, in the patient, untroubled gaze that dwelt upon his sister and this\nweirdly exquisite woman who held her.\n\n\"Wait!\" exclaimed Drake. \"Wait--hell! The damned witch is stealing her\naway from us!\"\n\nAgain he threw himself forward; recoiled as though swept back by an\ninvisible arm; fell against us and was clasped and held by Ventnor. And\nas he struggled the Thing we rode halted. Like metal waves back into it\nrushed the enigmatic billows that had washed over the fragments of the\ncity.\n\nWe were lifted; between us and the woman and girl a cleft appeared; it\nwidened into a rift. It was as though Norhala had decreed it as a symbol\nof this her second victory--or had set it between us as a barrier.\n\n\nWider grew the rift. Save for the bridge of our voices it separated us\nfrom Ruth as though she stood upon another world.\n\nHigher we rose; the three of us now upon the flat top of a tower upon\nwhose counterpart fifty feet away and facing the homeward path, Ruth and\nNorhala stood with white arms interlaced.\n\nThe serpent shape flashed toward us; it vanished beneath, merging into\nthe waiting Thing.\n\nThen slowly the Thing began to move; quietly it glided to the chasm it\nhad blasted in the cliff wall. The shadow of those walls fell upon us.\nAs one we looked back; as one we searched out the patch of blue with the\nblack blot at its breast.\n\nWe found it; then the precipices hid it. Silently we streamed through\nthe chasm, through the canyon and the tunnel--speaking no word, Drake's\neyes fixed with bitter hatred upon Norhala, Ventnor brooding upon her\nalways with that enigmatic sympathy. We passed between the walls of the\nfurther cleft; stood for an instant at the brink of the green forest.\n\nThere came to us as though from immeasurable distances, a faint,\nsustained thrumming--like the beating of countless muffled drums. The\nThing that carried us trembled--the sound died away. The Thing quieted;\nit began its steady, effortless striding through the crowding trees--but\nnow with none of that speed with which it had come, spurred forward by\nNorhala's awakened hate.\n\nVentnor stirred; broke the silence. And now I saw how wasted was his\nbody, how sharpened his face; almost ethereal; purged not only by\nsuffering but by, it came to me, some strange knowledge.\n\n\"No use, Drake,\" he said dreamily. \"All this is now on the knees of the\ngods. And whether those gods are humanity's or whether they are--Gods of\nMetal--I do not know.\n\n\"But this I do know--only one way or another can the balance fall; and\nif it be one way, then you and we shall have Ruth back. And if it falls\nthe other way--then there will be little need for us to care. For man\nwill be done!\"\n\n\"Martin! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It is the crisis,\" he answered. \"We can do nothing, Goodwin--nothing.\nWhatever is to be steps forth now from the womb of Destiny.\"\n\nAgain there came that distant rolling--louder, now. Again the Thing\ntrembled.\n\n\"The drums,\" whispered Ventnor. \"The drums of destiny. What is it they\nare heralding? A new birth of Earth and the passing of man? A new child\nto whom shall be given dominion--nay, to whom has been given dominion?\nOr is it--taps--for Them?\"\n\nThe drumming died as I listened--fearfully. About us was only the\nswishing, the sighing of the falling trees beneath the tread of the\nThing. Motionless stood Norhala; and as motionless Ruth.\n\n\"Martin,\" I cried once more, a dreadful doubt upon me. \"Martin--what do\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"Whence did--They--come?\" His voice was clear and calm, the eyes beneath\nthe red brand clear and quiet, too. \"Whence did They come--these Things\nthat carry us? That strode like destroying angels over Cherkis's\ncity? Are they spawn of Earth--as we are? Or are they foster\nchildren--changelings from another star?\n\n\"These creatures that when many still are one--that when one still are\nmany. Whence did They come? What are They?\"\n\nHe looked down upon the cubes that held us; their hosts of tiny eyes\nshone up at him, enigmatically--as though they heard and understood.\n\n\"I do not forget,\" he said. \"At least not all do I forget of what I saw\nduring that time when I seemed an atom outside space--as I told you,\nor think I told you, speaking with unthinkable effort through lips that\nseemed eternities away from me, the atom, who strove to open them.\n\n\"There were three--visions, revelations--I know not what to call them.\nAnd though each seemed equally real, of two of them, only one, I think,\ncan be true; and of the third--that may some time be true but surely is\nnot yet.\"\n\n\nThrough the air came a louder drum roll--in it something ominous,\nsomething sinister. It swelled to a crescendo; abruptly ceased. And now\nI saw Norhala raise her head; listen.\n\n\"I saw a world, a vast world, Goodwin, marching stately through space.\nIt was no globe--it was a world of many facets, of smooth and polished\nplanes; a huge blue jewel world, dimly luminous; a crystal world cut\nout from Aether. A geometric thought of the Great Cause, of God, if you\nwill, made material. It was airless, waterless, sunless.\n\n\"I seemed to draw closer to it. And then I saw that over every facet\npatterns were traced; gigantic symmetrical designs; mathematical\nhieroglyphs. In them I read unthinkable calculations, formulas of\ninterwoven universes, arithmetical progressions of armies of stars,\npandects of the motions of the suns. In the patterns was an appalling\nharmony--as though all the laws from those which guide the atom to those\nwhich direct the cosmos were there resolved into completeness--totalled.\n\n\"The faceted world was like a cosmic abacist, tallying as it marched the\nerrors of the infinite.\n\n\"The patterned symbols constantly changed form. I drew nearer--the\nsymbols were alive. They were, in untold numbers--These!\"\n\nHe pointed to the Thing that bore us.\n\n\"I was swept back; looked again upon it from afar. And a fantastic\nnotion came to me--fantasy it was, of course, yet built I know around\na nucleus of strange truth. It was\"--his tone was half whimsical,\nhalf apologetic--\"it was that this jeweled world was ridden by some\nmathematical god, driving it through space, noting occasionally with\namused tolerance the very bad arithmetic of another Deity the reverse\nof mathematical--a more or less haphazard Deity, the god, in fact, of us\nand the things we call living.\n\n\"It had no mission; it wasn't at all out to do any reforming; it wasn't\nin the least concerned in rectifying any of the inaccuracies of the\nOther. Only now and then it took note of the deplorable differences\nbetween the worlds it saw and its own impeccably ordered and tidy temple\nwith its equally tidy servitors.\n\n\"Just an itinerant demiurge of supergeometry riding along through space\non its perfectly summed-up world; master of all celestial mechanics;\nits people independent of all that complex chemistry and labor for\nequilibrium by which we live; needing neither air nor water, heeding\nneither heat nor cold; fed with the magnetism of interstellar space and\nstopping now and then to banquet off the energy of some great sun.\"\n\nA thrill of amazement passed through me; fantasy all this might be\nbut--how, if so, had he gotten that last thought? He had not seen, as\nwe had, the orgy in the Hall of the Cones, the prodigious feeding of the\nMetal Monster upon our sun.\n\n\"That passed,\" he went on, unnoticing. \"I saw vast caverns filled with\nthe Things; working, growing, multiplying. In caverns of our Earth--the\nfruit of some unguessed womb? I do not know.\n\n\"But in those caverns, under countless orbs of many colored\nlights\"--again the thrill of amaze shook me--\"they grew. It came to me\nthat they were reaching out toward sunlight and the open. They burst\ninto it--into yellow, glowing sunlight. Ours? I do not know. And that\npicture passed.\"\n\nHis voice deepened.\n\n\"There came a third vision. I saw our Earth--I knew, Goodwin,\nindisputably, unmistakably that it was our earth. But its rolling\nhills were leveled, its mountains were ground and shaped into cold and\npolished symbols--geometric, fashioned.\n\n\"The seas were fettered, gleaming like immense jewels in patterned\nsettings of crystal shores. The very Polar ice was chiseled. On the\nordered plains were traced the hieroglyphs of the faceted world. And on\nall Earth, Goodwin, there was no green life, no city, no trace of man.\nOn this Earth that had been ours were only--These.\n\n\"Visioning!\" he said. \"Don't think that I accept them in their entirety.\nPart truth, part illusion--the groping mind dazzled with light of\nunfamiliar truths and making pictures from half light and half shadow to\nhelp it understand.\n\n\"But still--SOME truth in them. How much I do not know. But this I\ndo know--that last vision was of a cataclysm whose beginnings we face\nnow--this very instant.\"\n\nThe picture flashed behind my own eyes--of the walled city, its\nthronging people, its groves and gardens, its science and its art; of\nthe Destroying Shapes trampling it flat--and then the dreadful, desolate\nmount.\n\nAnd suddenly I saw that mount as Earth--the city as Earth's cities--its\ngardens and groves as Earth's fields and forests--and the vanished\npeople of Cherkis seemed to expand into all humanity.\n\n\"But Martin,\" I stammered, fighting against choking, intolerable terror,\n\"there was something else. Something of the Keeper of the Cones and of\nour striking through the sun to destroy the Things--something of them\nbeing governed by the same laws that govern us and that if they broke\nthem they must fall. A hope--a PROMISE, that they would NOT conquer.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" he replied, \"but not clearly. There WAS something--a\nshadow upon them, a menace. It was a shadow that seemed to be born of\nour own world--some threatening spirit of earth hovering over them.\n\n\"I cannot remember; it eludes me. Yet it is because I remember but a\nlittle of it that I say those drums may not be--taps--for us.\"\n\n\nAs though his words had been a cue, the sounds again burst forth--no\nlonger muffled nor faint. They roared; they seemed to pelt through air\nand drop upon us; they beat about our ears with thunderous tattoo like\ncovered caverns drummed upon by Titans with trunks of great trees.\n\nThe drumming did not die; it grew louder, more vehement; defiant and\ndeafening. Within the Thing under us a mighty pulse began to throb,\naccelerating rapidly to the rhythm of that clamorous roll.\n\nI saw Norhala draw herself up, sharply; stand listening and alert. Under\nme, the throbbing turned to an uneasy churning, a ferment.\n\n\"Drums?\" muttered Drake. \"THEY'RE no drums. It's drum fire. It's like a\ndozen Marnes, a dozen Verduns. But where could batteries like those come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Drums,\" whispered Ventnor. \"They ARE drums. The drums of Destiny!\"\n\nLouder the roaring grew. Now it was a tremendous rhythmic cannonading.\nThe Thing halted. The tower that upheld Ruth and Norhala swayed, bent\nover the gap between us, touched the top on which we rode.\n\nGently the two were plucked up; swiftly they were set beside us.\n\nCame a shrill, keen wailing--louder than ever I had heard before. There\nwas an earthquake trembling; a maelstrom swirling in which we spun; a\nswift sinking.\n\nThe Thing split in two. Up before us rose a stupendous, stepped pyramid;\nlittle smaller it was than that which Cheops built to throw its shadows\nacross holy Nile. Into it streamed, over it clicked, score upon score of\ncubes, building it higher and higher. It lurched forward--away from us.\n\nFrom Norhala came a single cry--resonant, blaring like a wrathful,\ngolden trumpet.\n\nThe speeding shape halted, hesitated; it seemed about to return. Crashed\ndown upon us an abrupt crescendo of the distant drumming; peremptory,\ncommanding. The shape darted forward; raced away crushing to straw the\ntrees beneath it in a full quarter-mile-wide swath.\n\nGreat gray eyes wide, filled with incredulous wonder, stunned disbelief,\nNorhala for an instant faltered. Then out of her white throat, through\nher red lips pelted a tempest of staccato buglings.\n\nUnder them what was left of the Thing leaped, tore on. Norhala's flaming\nhair crackled and streamed; about her body of milk and pearl--about\nRuth's creamy skin--a radiant nimbus began to glow.\n\nIn the distance I saw a sapphire spark; knew it for Norhala's home. Not\nfar from it now was the rushing pyramid--and it came to me that within\nthat shape was strangely neither globe nor pyramid. Nor except for\nthe trembling cubes that made the platform on which we stood, did the\nshrunken Thing carrying us hold any unit of the Metal Monster except its\nspheres and tetrahedrons--at least within its visible bulk.\n\nThe sapphire spark had grown to a glimmering azure marble. Steadily we\ngained upon the pyramid. Never for an instant ceased that scourging hail\nof notes from Norhala--never for an instant lessened the drumming clamor\nthat seemed to try to smother them.\n\nThe sapphire marble became a sapphire ball, a great globe. I saw the\nThing we sought to join lift itself into a prodigious pillar; the\npillar's base thrust forth stilts; upon them the Thing stepped over the\nblue dome of Norhala's house.\n\nThe blue bubble was close; now it curved below us. Gently we were lifted\ndown; were set before its portal. I looked up at the bulk that had\ncarried us.\n\nI had been right--built it was only of globe and pyramid; an\ninconceivably grotesque shape, it hung over us.\n\nThroughout the towering Shape was awful movement; its units writhed\nwithin it. Then it was lost to sight in the mists through which the\nThing we had pursued had gone.\n\nIn Norhala's face as she watched it go was a dismay, a poignant\nuncertainty, that held in it something indescribably pitiful.\n\n\"I am afraid!\" I heard her whisper.\n\nShe tightened her grasp upon dreaming Ruth; motioned us to go within.\nWe passed, silently; behind us she came, followed by three of the great\nglobes, by a pair of her tetrahedrons.\n\nBeside a pile of the silken stuffs she halted. The girl's eyes dwelt\nupon hers trustingly.\n\n\"I am afraid!\" whispered Norhala again. \"Afraid--for you!\"\n\nTenderly she looked down upon her, the galaxies of stars in her eyes\nsoft and tremulous.\n\n\"I am afraid, little sister,\" she whispered for the third time. \"Not yet\ncan you go as I do--among the fires.\" She hesitated. \"Rest here until I\nreturn. I shall leave these to guard you and obey you.\"\n\nShe motioned to the five shapes. They ranged themselves about Ruth.\nNorhala kissed her upon both brown eyes.\n\n\"Sleep till I return,\" she murmured.\n\nShe swept from the chamber--with never a glance for us three. I heard a\nlittle wailing chorus without, fast dying into silence.\n\nSpheres and pyramids twinkled at us, guarding the silken pile whereon\nRuth lay asleep--like some enchanted princess.\n\nBeat down upon the blue globe like hollow metal worlds, beaten and\nshrieking.\n\nThe drums of Destiny!\n\nThe drums of Doom!\n\nBeating taps for the world of men?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. THE FRENZY OF RUTH\n\nFor many minutes we stood silent, in the shadowy chamber, listening,\neach absorbed in his own thoughts. The thunderous drumming was\ncontinuous; sometimes it faded into a background for clattering storms\nas of thousands of machine guns, thousands of riveters at work at once\nupon a thousand metal frameworks; sometimes it was nearly submerged\nbeneath splitting crashes as of meeting meteors of hollow steel.\n\nBut always the drumming persisted, rhythmic, thunderous. Through it\nall Ruth slept, undisturbed, cheek pillowed in one rounded arm, the two\ngreat pyramids erect behind her, watchful; a globe at her feet, a globe\nat her head, the third sphere poised between her and us, and, like the\npyramids--watchful.\n\nWhat was happening out there--over the edge of the canyon, beyond the\nportal of the cliffs, behind the veils, in the Pit of the Metal Monster?\nWhat was the message of the roaring drums? What the rede of their\nclamorous runes?\n\nVentnor stepped by the sentinel globe, bent over the tranced girl.\nSphere nor pointed pair stirred; only they watched him--like a palpable\nthing one felt their watchfulness. He listened to her heart, caught up\na wrist, took note of her pulse of life. He drew a deep breath, stood\nupright, nodded reassuringly.\n\nAbruptly Drake turned, walked out through the open portal, his strain\nand a very deep anxiety written plainly in deep lines that ran from\nnostrils to firm young mouth.\n\n\"Just went out to look for the pony,\" he muttered when he returned.\n\"It's safe. I was afraid it had been stepped on. It's getting dusk.\nThere's a big light down the canyon--over in the valley.\"\n\nVentnor drew back past the globe; rejoined us.\n\nThe blue bower trembled under a gust of sound. Ruth stirred; her brows\nknitted; her hands clenched. The sphere that stood before her spun on\nits axis, swept up to the globe at her head, glided from it to the globe\nat her feet--as though whispering. Ruth moaned--her body bent upright,\nswayed rigidly. Her eyes opened; they stared through us as though upon\nsome dreadful vision; and strangely was it as though she were seeing\nwith another's eyes, were reflecting another's sufferings.\n\nThe globes at her feet and at her head swirled out, clustering against\nthe third sphere--three weird shapes in silent consultation. On\nVentnor's face I saw pity--and a vast relief. With shocked amaze I\nrealized that Ruth's agony--for in agony she clearly was--was calling\nforth in him elation. He spoke--and I knew why.\n\n\"Norhala!\" he whispered. \"She is seeing with Norhala's eyes--feeling\nwhat Norhala feels. It's not going well with--That--out there. If we\ndared leave Ruth--could only, see--\"\n\nRuth leaped to her feet; cried out--a golden bugling that might have\nbeen Norhala's own wrathful trumpet notes. Instantly the two pyramids\nflamed open, became two gleaming stars that bathed her in violet\nradiance. Beneath their upper tips I saw the blasting ovals\nglitter--menacingly.\n\nThe girl glared at us--more brilliant grew the glittering ovals as\nthough their lightnings trembled on their lips.\n\n\"Ruth!\" called Ventnor softly.\n\nA shadow softened the intolerable, hard brilliancy of the brown eyes. In\nthem something struggled to arise, fighting its way to the surface like\nsome drowning human thing.\n\nIt sank back--upon her face dropped a cloud of heartbreak, appalling\nwoe; the despair of a soul that, having withdrawn all faith in its\nown kind to rest all faith, as it thought, on angels--sees that faith\nbetrayed.\n\nThere stared upon us a stripped spirit, naked and hopeless and terrible.\n\nDespairing, raging, she screamed once more. The central globe swam to\nher; it raised her upon its back; glided to the doorway. Upon it she\nstood poised like some youthful, anguished Victory--a Victory who faced\nand knew she faced destroying defeat; poised upon that enigmatic orb\non bare slender feet, one sweet breast bare, hands upraised, virginally\narchaic, nothing about her of the Ruth we knew.\n\n\"Ruth!\" cried Drake; despair as great as that upon her face was in his\nvoice. He sprang before the globe that held her; barred its way.\n\nFor an instant the Thing paused--and in that instant the human soul of\nthe girl rushed back.\n\n\"No!\" she cried. \"No!\"\n\nA weird call issued from the white lips--stumbling, uncertain, as though\nshe who sent it forth herself wondered whence it sprang. Abruptly the\nangry stars closed. The three globes spun--doubting, puzzled! Again she\ncalled--now a tremulous, halting cadence. She was lifted; dropped gently\nto her feet.\n\nFor an instant the globes and pyramids whirled and danced before\nher--then sped away through the portal.\n\nRuth swayed, sobbing. Then as though drawn, she ran to the doorway,\nfled through it. As one we sprang after her. Rods ahead her white\nbody flashed, speeding toward the Pit. Like fleet-footed Atalanta she\nfled--and far, far behind us was the blue bower, the misty barrier of\nthe veils close, when Drake with a last desperate burst reached her\nside, gripped her. Down the two fell, rolling upon the smooth roadway.\nSilently she fought, biting, tearing at Drake, struggling to escape.\n\n\"Quick!\" gasped Ventnor, stretching out to me an arm. \"Cut off the\nsleeve. Quick!\"\n\nUnquestioningly, I drew my knife, ripped the garment at the shoulder. He\nsnatched the sleeve, knelt at Ruth's head; rapidly he crumpled an end,\nthrust it roughly into her mouth; tied it fast, gagging her.\n\n\"Hold her!\" he ordered Drake; and with a sob of relief sprang up. The\ngirl's eyes blazed at him, filled with hate.\n\n\"Cut that other sleeve,\" he said; and when I had done so, he knelt\nagain, pinned Ruth down with a knee at her throat, turned her over and\nknotted her hands behind her. She ceased struggling; gently now he drew\nup the curly head; swung her upon her back.\n\n\"Hold her feet.\" He nodded to Drake, who caught the slender bare ankles\nin his hands.\n\n\nShe lay there, helpless, being unable to use her hands or feet.\n\n\"Too little Ruth, and too much Norhala,\" said Ventnor, looking up at me.\n\"If she'd only thought to cry out! She could have brought a regiment of\nthose Things down to blast us. And would--if she HAD thought. You don't\nthink THAT is Ruth, do you?\"\n\nHe pointed to the pallid face glaring at him, the eyes from which cold\nfires flamed.\n\n\"No, you don't!\" He caught Drake by the shoulder, sent him spinning a\ndozen feet away. \"Damn it, Drake--don't you understand!\"\n\nFor suddenly Ruth's eyes softened; she had turned them on Dick\npitifully, appealingly--and he had loosed her ankles, had leaned forward\nas though to draw away the band that covered her lips.\n\n\"Your gun,\" whispered Ventnor to me; before I had moved he had snatched\nthe automatic from my holster; had covered Drake with it.\n\n\"Drake,\" he said, \"stand where you are. If you take another step toward\nthis girl I'll shoot you--by God, I will!\"\n\nDrake halted, shocked amazement in his face; I myself felt resentful,\nwondering at his outburst.\n\n\"But it's hurting her,\" he muttered, Ruth's eyes, soft and pleading,\nstill dwelt upon him.\n\n\"Hurting her!\" exclaimed Ventnor. \"Man--she's my sister! I know what I'm\ndoing. Can't you see? Can't you see how little of Ruth is in that body\nthere--how little of the girl you love? How or why I don't know--but\nthat it is so I DO know. Drake--have you forgotten how Norhala beguiled\nCherkis? I want my sister back. I'm helping her to get back. Now let be.\nI know what I'm doing. Look at her!\"\n\nWe looked. In the face that glared up at Ventnor was nothing of\nRuth--even as he had said. There was the same cold, awesome wrath that\nhad rested upon Norhala's as she watched Cherkis weep over the eating up\nof his city. Swiftly came a change--like the sudden smoothing out of the\nrushing waves of a hill-locked, wind-lashed lake.\n\nThe face was again Ruth's face--and Ruth's alone; the eyes were Ruth's\neyes--supplicating, adjuring.\n\n\"Ruth!\" Ventnor cried. \"While you can hear--am I not right?\"\n\nShe nodded vigorously, sternly; she was lost, hidden once more.\n\n\"You see.\" He turned to us grimly.\n\nA shattering shaft of light flashed upon the veils; almost pierced them.\nAn avalanche of sound passed high above us. Yet now I noted that where\nwe stood the clamor was lessened, muffled. Of course, it came to me, it\nwas the veils.\n\nI wondered why--for whatever the quality of the radiant mists, their\npurpose certainly had to do with concentration of the magnetic flux. The\ndeadening of the noise must be accidental, could have nothing to do with\ntheir actual use; for sound is an air vibration solely. No--it must be a\nsecondary effect. The Metal Monster was as heedless of clamor as it was\nof heat or cold--\n\n\"We've got to see,\" Ventnor broke the chain of thought. \"We've got to\nget through and see what's happening. Win or lose--we've got to KNOW.\"\n\n\"Cut off your sleeve, as I did,\" he motioned to Drake. \"Tie her ankles.\nWe'll carry her.\"\n\nQuickly it was done. Ruth's light body swinging between brother and\nlover, we moved forward into the mists; we crept cautiously through\ntheir dead silences.\n\nPassed out and fell back into them from a searing chaos of light,\nchaotic tumult.\n\nFrom the slackened grip of Ventnor and Drake the body of Ruth dropped\nwhile we three stood blinded, deafened, fighting for recovery. Ruth\ntwisted, rolled toward the brink; Ventnor threw himself upon her, held\nher fast.\n\n\nDragging her, crawling on our knees, we crept forward; we stopped when\nthe thinning of the mists permitted us to see through them yet still\ninterposed a curtaining which, though tenuous, dimmed the intolerable\nbrilliancy that filled the Pit, muffled its din to a degree we could\nbear.\n\nI peered through them--and nerve and muscle were locked in the grip of\na paralyzing awe. I felt then as one would feel set close to warring\nregiments of stars, made witness to the death-throes of a universe, or\nswept through space and held above the whirling coils of Andromeda's\nnebula to watch its birth agonies of nascent suns.\n\nThese are no figures of speech, no hyperboles--speck as our whole\nplanet would be in Andromeda's vast loom, pinprick as was the Pit to\nthe cyclone craters of our own sun, within the cliff-cupped walls of the\nvalley was a tangible, struggling living force akin to that which\ndwells within the nebula and the star; a cosmic spirit transcending all\ndimensions and thrusting its confines out into the infinite; a sentient\nemanation of the infinite itself.\n\nNor was its voice less unearthly. It used the shell of the earth valley\nfor its trumpetings, its clangors--but as one hears in the murmurings\nof the fluted conch the great voice of ocean, its whispering and\nits roarings, so here in the clamorous shell of the Pit echoed the\ntremendous voices of that illimitable sea which laps the shores of the\ncountless suns.\n\nI looked upon a mighty whirlpool miles and miles wide. It whirled with\nsurges whose racing crests were smiting incandescences; it was threaded\nwith a spindrift of lightnings; it was trodden by dervish mists of\nmolten flame thrust through with forests of lances of living light. It\ncast a cadent spray high to the heavens.\n\nOver it the heavens glittered as though they were a shield held by\nfearful gods. Through the maelstrom staggered a mountainous bulk; a\ngleaming leviathan of pale blue metal caught in the swirling tide of\nsome incredible volcano; a huge ark of metal breasting a deluge of\nflame.\n\nAnd the drumming we heard as of hollow beaten metal worlds, the shouting\ntempests of cannonading stars, was the breaking of these incandescent\ncrests, the falling of the lightning spindrift, the rhythmic impact of\nthe lanced rays upon the glimmering mountain that reeled and trembled as\nthey struck it.\n\nThe reeling mountain, the struggling leviathan, was--the City!\n\nIt was the mass of the Metal Monster itself, guarded by, stormed by,\nits own legions that though separate from it were still as much of it as\nwere the cells that formed the skin of its walls, its carapace.\n\nIt was the Metal Monster tearing, rending, fighting for, battling\nagainst--itself.\n\nMile high as when I had first beheld it was the inexplicable body that\nheld the great heart of the cones into which had been drawn the magnetic\ncataracts from our sun; that held too the smaller hearts of the lesser\ncones, the workshops, the birth chamber and manifold other mysteries\nunguessed and unseen. By a full fourth had its base been shrunken.\n\nRanged in double line along the side turned toward us were hundreds of\ndread forms--Shapes that in their intensity bore down upon, oppressed\nwith a nightmare weight, the consciousness.\n\nRectangular, upon their outlines no spike of pyramid, no curve of globe\nshowing, uncompromisingly ponderous, they upthrust. Upon the tops of the\nfirst rank were enormous masses, sledge shaped--like those metal fists\nthat had battered down the walls of Cherkis's city but to them as the\nhuman hand is to the paw of the dinosaur.\n\nConceive this--conceive these Shapes as animate and flexible; beating\ndown with the prodigious mallets, smashing from side to side as though\nthe tremendous pillars that held them were thousand jointed upright\npistons; that as closely as I can present it in images of things we know\nis the picture of the Hammering Things.\n\n\nBehind them stood a second row, high as they and as angular. From them\nextended scores of girdered arms. These were thickly studded with the\nflaming cruciform shapes, the opened cubes gleaming with their angry\nflares of reds and smoky yellows. From the tentacles of many swung\nimmense shields like those which ringed the hall of the great cones.\n\nAnd as the sledges beat, ever over their bent heads poured from the\ncrosses a flood of crimson lightnings. Out of the concave depths of\nthe shields whipped lashes of blinding flame. With ropes of fire\nthey knouted the Things the sledges struck, the sullen crimson levins\nblasted.\n\nNow I could see the Shapes that attacked. Grotesque; spined and tusked,\nspiked and antlered, wenned and breasted; as chimerically angled, cusped\nand cornute as though they were the superangled, supercornute gods of\nthe cusped and angled gods of the Javanese, they strove against the\nsledge-headed and smiting, the multiarmed and blasting square towers.\n\nHigh as them, as huge as they, incomparably fantastic, in dozens of\nshifting forms they battled.\n\nMore than a mile from the stumbling City stood ranged like sharpshooters\na host of solid, bristling-legged towers. Upon their tops spun gigantic\nwheels. Out of the centers of these wheels shot the radiant lances,\nhosts of spears of intensest violet light. The radiance they volleyed\nwas not continuous; it was broken, so that the javelin rays shot out in\nrhythmic flights, each flying fast upon the shafts of the others.\n\nIt was their impact that sent forth the thunderous drumming. They struck\nand splintered against the walls, dropping from them in great gouts of\nmolten flame. It was as though before they broke they pierced the wall,\nthe Monster's side, bled fire.\n\nWith the crashing of broadsides of massed batteries the sledges smashed\ndown upon the bristling attackers. Under the awful impact globes and\npyramids were shattered into hundreds of fragments, rocket bursts of\nblue and azure and violet flame, flames rainbowed and irised.\n\nThe hammer ends split, flew apart, were scattered, were falling showers\nof sulphurous yellow and scarlet meteors. But ever other cubes swarmed\nout and repaired the broken smiting tips. And always where a tusked and\ncornute shape had been battered down, disintegrated, another arose\nas huge and as formidable pouring forth upon the squared tower its\nlightnings, tearing at it with colossal spiked and hooked claws, beating\nit with incredible spiked and globular fists that were like the clenched\nhands of some metal Atlas.\n\nAs the striving Shapes swayed and wrestled, gave way or thrust forward,\nstaggered or fell, the bulk of the Monster stumbled and swayed, advanced\nand retreated--an unearthly motion wedded to an amorphous immensity that\nflooded the watching consciousness with a deathly nausea.\n\nUnceasingly the hail of radiant lances poured from the spinning wheels,\nfalling upon Towered Shapes and City's wall alike. There arose a\nprodigious wailing, an unearthly thin screaming. About the bases of the\ndefenders flashed blinding bursts of incandescence--like those which had\nheralded the flight of the Flying Thing dropping before Norhala's house.\n\nUnlike them they held no dazzling sapphire brilliancies; they were\nochreous, suffused with raging vermilion. Nevertheless they were factors\nof that same inexplicable action--for from thousands of gushing lights\nleaped thousands of gigantic square pillars; unimaginable projectiles\nhurled from the flaming mouths of earth-hidden, titanic mortars.\n\nThey soared high, swerved and swooped upon the lance-throwers. Beneath\ntheir onslaught those chimerae tottered, I saw living projectiles and\nliving target fuse where they met--melt and weld in jets of lightnings.\n\nBut not all. There were those that tore great gaps in the horned\ngiants--wounds that instantly were healed with globes and pyramids\nseething out from the Cyclopean trunk. Ever the incredible projectiles\nflashed and flew as though from some inexhaustible store; ever uprose\nthat prodigious barrage against the smiting rays.\n\nNow to check them soared from the ranks of the besiegers clouds of\ncountless horned dragons, immense cylinders of clustered cubes studded\nwith the clinging tetrahedrons. They struck the cubed projectiles head\non; aimed themselves to meet them.\n\nBristling dragon and hurtling pillar stuck and fused or burst with\nintolerable blazing. They fell--cube and sphere and pyramid--some half\nopened, some fully, in a rain of disks, of stars, huge flaming crosses;\na storm of unimaginable pyrotechnics.\n\nNow I became conscious that within the City--within the body of the\nMetal Monster--there raged a strife colossal as this without. From it\ncame a vast volcanic roaring. Up from its top shot tortured flames,\ncascades and fountains of frenzied Things that looped and struggled,\nwrithed over its edge, hurled themselves back; battling chimerae which\nagainst the glittering heavens traced luminous symbols of agony.\n\nShrilled a stronger wailing. Up from behind the ray hurling Towers shot\nhosts of globes. Thousands of palely azure, metal moons they soared;\nwarrior moons charging in meteor rush and streaming with fluttering\nbattle pennons of violet flame. High they flew; they curved over the\nmile high back of the Monster; they dropped upon it.\n\nArose to meet them immense columns of the cubes; battered against\nthe spheres; swept them over and down into the depths. Hundreds fell,\nbroken--but thousands held their place. I saw them twine about the\npillars--writhing columns of interlaced cubes and globes straining\nlike monstrous serpents while all along their coils the open disks and\ncrosses smote with the scimitars of their lightnings.\n\nIn the wall of the City appeared a shining crack; from top to bottom it\nran; it widened into a rift from which a flood of radiance gushed. Out\nof this rift poured a thousand-foot-high torrent of horned globes.\n\nOnly for an instant they flowed. The rift closed upon them, catching\nthose still emerging in a colossal vise. It CRUNCHED them. Plain through\nthe turmoil came a dreadful--bursting roar.\n\nDown from the closing jaws of the vise dripped a stream of fragments\nthat flashed and flickered--and died. And now in the wall was no trace\nof the breach.\n\nA hurricane of radiant lances swept it. Under them a mile wide section\nof the living scarp split away; dropped like an avalanche. Its fall\nrevealed great spaces, huge vaults and chambers filled with warring\nlightnings--out from them came roaring, bellowing thunders. Swiftly from\neach side of the gap a metal curtaining of the cubes joined. Again the\nwall was whole.\n\nI turned my stunned gaze from the City--swept over the valley.\nEverywhere, in towers, in writhing coils, in whipping flails, in waves\nthat smote and crashed, in countless forms and combinations the Metal\nHordes battled. Here were pillars against which metal billows rushed\nand were broken; there were metal comets that crashed high above the mad\nturmoil.\n\nFrom streaming silent veil to veil--north and south, east and west the\nMonster slew itself beneath its racing, flaming banners, the tempests of\nits lightnings.\n\nThe tortured hulk of the City lurched; it swept toward us. Before it\nblotted out from our eyes the Pit I saw that the crystal spans upon the\nriver of jade were gone; that the wondrous jeweled ribbons of its banks\nwere broken.\n\nCloser came the reeling City.\n\nI fumbled for my lenses, focussed them upon it. Now I saw that where\nthe radiant lances struck they--killed the blocks blackened under them,\nbecame lustreless; the sparkling of the tiny eyes--went out; the metal\ncarapaces crumbled.\n\nCloser to the City--came the Monster; shuddering I lowered the glasses\nthat it might not seem so near.\n\nDown dropped the bristling Shapes that wrestled with the squared Towers.\nThey rose again in a single monstrous wave that rushed to overwhelm\nthem. Before they could strike the City swept closer; had hidden them\nfrom me.\n\nAgain I raised the glasses. They brought the metal scarp not fifty feet\naway--within it the hosts of tiny eyes glittered, no longer mocking nor\nmalicious, but insane.\n\nNearer drew the Monster--nearer.\n\nA thousand feet away it checked its movement, seemed to draw itself\ntogether. Then like the roar of a falling world that whole side facing\nus slid down to the valley's floor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. THE PASSING OF NORHALA\n\nHundreds of feet through must have been the fallen mass--within it who\nknows what chambers filled with mysteries? Yes, thousands of feet thick\nit must have been, for the debris of it splintered and lashed to the\nvery edge of the ledge on which we crouched; heaped it with the dimming\nfragments of the bodies that had formed it.\n\nWe looked into a thousand vaults, a thousand spaces. There came another\navalanche roaring--before us opened the crater of the cones.\n\nThrough the torn gap I saw them, clustering undisturbed about the base\nof that one slender, coroneted and star pointing spire, rising serene\nand unshaken from a hell of lightnings. But the shields that had rimmed\nthe crater were gone.\n\nVentnor snatched the glasses from my hand, leveled and held them long to\nhis eyes.\n\nHe thrust them back to me. \"Look!\"\n\nThrough the lenses the great hall leaped into full view apparently only\na few yards away. It was a cauldron of chameleon flame. It seethed with\nthe Hordes battling over the remaining walls and floor. But around the\ncrystal base of the cones was an open zone into which none broke.\n\nIn that wide ring, girdling the shimmering fantasy like a circled\nsanctuary, were but three forms. One was the wondrous Disk of jeweled\nfires I have called the Metal Emperor; the second was the sullen fired\ncruciform of the Keeper.\n\nThe third was Norhala!\n\nShe stood at the side of that weird master of hers--or was it after all\nthe servant? Between them and the Keeper's planes gleamed the gigantic\nT-shaped tablet of countless rods which controlled the activities of the\ncones; that had controlled the shifting of the vanished shields; that\nmanipulated too, perhaps, the energies of whatever similar but smaller\ncornute ganglia were scattered throughout the City and one of which we\nhad beheld when the Emperor's guards had blasted Ventnor.\n\nClose was Norhala in the lenses--so close that almost, it seemed, I\ncould reach out and touch her. The flaming hair streamed and billowed\nabove her glorious head like a banner of molten floss of coppery gold;\nher face was a mask of wrath and despair; her great eyes blazed upon the\nKeeper; her exquisite body was bare, stripped of every shred of silken\ncovering.\n\nFrom streaming tresses to white feet an oval of pulsing, golden light\nnimbused her. Maiden Isis, virgin Astarte she stood there, held in the\ngrip of the Disk--like a goddess betrayed and hopeless yet thirsting for\nvengeance.\n\nFor all their stillness, their immobility, it came to me that Emperor\nand Keeper were at grapple, locked in death grip; the realization was as\ndefinite as though, like Ruth, I thought with Norhala's mind, saw with\nher eyes.\n\nClearly too it came to me that in this contest between the two was\nepitomized all the vast conflict that raged around them; that in it was\nfast ripening that fruit of destiny of which Ventnor had spoken, and\nthat here in the Hall of the Cones would be settled--and soon--the fate\nnot only of Disk and Cross, but it might be of humanity.\n\nBut with what unknown powers was that duel being fought? They cast no\nlightnings, they battled with no visible weapons. Only the great planes\nof the inverted cruciform Shape smoked and smoldered with their sullen\nflares of ochres and of scarlets; while over all the face of the\nDisk its cold and irised fires raced and shone, beating with a rhythm\nincredibly rapid; its core of incandescent ruby blazed, its sapphire\novals were cabochoned pools of living, lucent radiance.\n\nThere was a splitting roar that arose above all the clamor, deafening\nus even in the shelter of the silent veils. On each side of the crater\nwhole masses of the City dropped away. Fleetingly I was aware of scores\nof smaller pits in which uprose lesser replicas of the Coned Mount,\nlesser reservoirs of the Monster's force.\n\nNeither the Emperor nor the Keeper moved, both seemingly indifferent to\nthe catastrophe fast developing around them.\n\nNow I strained forward to the very thinnest edge of the curtainings.\nFor between the Disk and Cross began to form fine black mist. It was\ntransparent. It seemed spun of minute translucent ebon corpuscles. It\nhung like a black shroud suspended by unseen hands. It shook and wavered\nnow toward the Disk, now toward the Cross.\n\nI sensed a keying up of force within the two; knew that each was\nstriving to cast like a net that hanging mist upon the other.\n\nAbruptly the Emperor flashed forth, blindingly. As though caught upon a\nblast, the black shroud flew toward the Keeper--enveloped it. And as the\nmist covered and clung I saw the sulphurous and crimson flares dim. They\nwere snuffed out.\n\nThe Keeper fell!\n\n\nUpon Norhala's face flamed a wild triumph, banishing despair. The\noutstretched planes of the Cross swept up as though in torment. For an\ninstant its fires flared and licked through the clinging blackness; it\nwrithed half upright, threw itself forward, crashed down prostrate upon\nthe enigmatic tablet which only its tentacles could manipulate.\n\nFrom Norhala's face the triumph fled. On its heels rushed stark,\nincredulous horror.\n\nThe Mount of Cones shuddered. From it came a single mighty throb of\nforce--like a prodigious heart-beat. Under that pulse of power the\nEmperor staggered, spun--and spinning, swept Norhala from her feet,\nswung her close to its flashing rose.\n\nA second throb pulsed from the cones, and mightier.\n\nA spasm shook the Disk--a paroxysm.\n\nIts fires faded; they flared out again, bathing the floating, unearthly\nfigure of Norhala with their iridescences.\n\nI saw her body writhe--as though it shared the agony of the Shape that\nheld her. Her head twisted; the great eyes, pools of uncomprehending,\nunbelieving horror, stared into mine.\n\nWith a spasmodic, infinitely dreadful movement the Disk closed--\n\nAnd closed upon her!\n\nNorhala was gone--was shut within it. Crushed to the pent fires of its\ncrystal heart.\n\nI heard a sobbing, agonized choking--knew it was I who sobbed. Against\nme I felt Ruth's body strike, bend in convulsive arc, drop inert.\n\nThe slender steeple of the cones drooped sending its faceted coronet\nshattering to the floor. The Mount melted. Beneath the flooding radiance\nsprawled Keeper and the great inert Globe that was the Goddess woman's\nsepulcher.\n\nThe crater filled with the pallid luminescence. Faster and ever faster\nit poured down into the Pit. And from all the lesser craters of the\nsmaller cones swept silent cataracts of the same pale radiance.\n\nThe City began to crumble--the Monster to fall.\n\nLike pent-up waters rushing through a broken dam the gleaming deluge\nswept over the valley; gushing in steady torrents from the breaking\nmass. Over the valley fell a vast silence. The lightnings ceased. The\nMetal Hordes stood rigid, the shining flood lapping at their bases,\nrising swiftly ever higher.\n\nNow from the sinking City swarmed multitudes of its weird luminaries.\n\nOut they trooped, swirling from every rent and gap--orbs scarlet and\nsapphire, ruby orbs, orbs tuliped and irised--the jocund suns of the\nbirth chamber and side by side with them hosts of the frozen, pale gilt,\nstiff rayed suns.\n\nThousands upon thousands they marched forth and poised themselves\nsolemnly over all the Pit that now was a fast rising lake of yellow\nfroth of sun flame.\n\nThey swept forth in squadrons, in companies, in regiments, those\nmysterious orbs. They floated over all the valley; they separated and\nswung motionless above it as though they were mysterious multiple souls\nof fire brooding over the dying shell that had held them.\n\nBeneath, thrusting up from the lambent lake like grotesque towers of\nsome drowned fantastic metropolis, the great Shapes stood, black against\nits glowing.\n\nWhat had been the City--that which had been the bulk of the Monster--was\nnow only a vast and shapeless hill from which streamed the silent\ntorrents of that released, unknown force which, concentrate and bound,\nhad been the cones.\n\nAs though it was the Monster's shining life-blood it poured, raising\never higher in its swift flooding the level radiant lake.\n\nLower and lower sank the immense bulk; squattered and spread, ever\nlowering--about its helpless, patient crouching something ineffably\npiteous, something indescribably, COSMICALLY tragic.\n\nAbruptly the watching orbs shook under a hail of sparkling atoms\nstreaming down from the glittering sky; raining upon the lambent lake.\nSo thick they fell that now the brooding luminaries were dim aureoles\nwithin them.\n\nFrom the Pit came a blinding, insupportable brilliancy. From every\nrigid tower gleamed out jeweled fires; their clinging units opened into\nblazing star and disk and cross. The City was a hill of living gems over\nwhich flowed torrents of pale molten gold.\n\nThe Pit blazed.\n\n\nThere followed an appalling tensity; a prodigious gathering of force;\na panic stirring concentration of energy. Thicker fell the clouds of\nsparkling atoms--higher rose the yellow flood.\n\nVentnor cried out. I could not hear him, but I read his purpose--and\nso did Drake. Up on his broad shoulders he swung Ruth as though she had\nbeen a child. Back through the throbbing veils we ran; passed out of\nthem.\n\n\"Back!\" shouted Ventnor. \"Back as far as you can!\"\n\nOn we raced; we reached the gateway of the cliffs; we dashed on and\non--up the shining roadway toward the blue globe now a scant mile before\nus; ran sobbing, panting--ran, we knew, for our lives.\n\nOut of the Pit came a sound--I cannot describe it!\n\nAn unutterably desolate, dreadful wail of despair, it shuddered past us\nlike the groaning of a broken-hearted star--anguished and awesome.\n\nIt died. There rushed upon us a sea of that incredible loneliness, that\nlonging for extinction that had assailed us in the haunted hollow where\nfirst we had seen Norhala. But its billows were resistless, invincible.\nBeneath them we fell; were torn by desire for swift death.\n\nDimly, through fainting eyes, I saw a dazzling brilliancy fill the sky;\nheard with dying ears a chaotic, blasting roar. A wave of air thicker\nthan water caught us up, hurled us hundreds of yards forward. It dropped\nus; in its wake rushed another wave, withering, scorching.\n\nIt raced over us. Scorching though it was, within its heat was\nenergizing, revivifying force; something that slew the deadly despair\nand fed the fading fires of life.\n\nI staggered to my feet; looked back. The veils were gone. The precipice\nwalled gateway they had curtained was filled with a Plutonic glare as\nthough it opened into the incandescent heart of a volcano.\n\nVentnor clutched my shoulder, spun me around. He pointed to the sapphire\nhouse, started to run to it. Far ahead I saw Drake, the body of the girl\nclasped to his breast. The heat became blasting, insupportable; my lungs\nburned.\n\nOver the sky above the canyon streaked a serpentine chain of lightnings.\nA sudden cyclonic gust swept the cleft, whirling us like leaves toward\nthe Pit.\n\nI threw myself upon my face, clutching at the smooth rock. A volley of\nthunder burst--but not the thunder of the Metal Monster or its Hordes;\nno, the bellowing of the levins of our own earth.\n\nAnd the wind was cold; it bathed the burning skin; laved the fevered\nlungs.\n\nAgain the sky was split by the lightnings. And roaring down from it in\nsolid sheets came the rain.\n\nFrom the Pit arose a hissing as though within it raged Babylonian\nTiamat, Mother of Chaos, serpent dweller in the void; Midgard-snake of\nthe ancient Norse holding in her coils the world.\n\nBuffeted by wind, beaten down by rain, clinging to each other like\ndrowning men, Ventnor and I pushed on to the elfin globe. The light was\ndying fast. By it we saw Drake pass within the portal with his burden.\nThe light became embers; it went out; blackness clasped us. Guided by\nthe lightnings, we beat our way to the door; passed through it.\n\nIn the electric glare we saw Drake bending over Ruth. In it I saw\na slide draw over the open portal through which shrieked the wind,\nstreamed the rain.\n\nAs though its crystal panel was moved by unseen, gentle hands, the\nportal closed; the tempest shut out.\n\nWe dropped beside Ruth upon a pile of silken stuffs--awed, marveling,\ntrembling with pity and--thanksgiving.\n\nFor we knew--each of us knew with an absolute definiteness as we\ncrouched there among the racing, dancing black and silver shadows with\nwhich the lightnings filled the blue globe--that the Metal Monster was\ndead.\n\nSlain by itself!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. BURNED OUT\n\nRuth sighed and stirred. By the glare of the lightnings, now almost\ncontinuous, we saw that her rigidity, and in fact all the puzzling\ncataleptic symptoms, had disappeared. Her limbs relaxed, her skin\nfaintly flushed, she lay in deepest but natural slumber undisturbed by\nthe incessant cannonading of the thunder under which the walls of the\nblue globe shuddered. Ventnor passed through the curtains of the central\nhall; he returned with one of Norhala's cloaks; covered the girl with\nit.\n\nAn overwhelming sleepiness took possession of me, a weariness ineffable.\nNerve and brain and muscle suddenly relaxed, went slack and numb.\nWithout a struggle I surrendered to an overpowering stupor and cradled\ndeep in its heart ceased consciously to be.\n\n\nWhen my eyes unclosed the chamber of the moonstone walls was filled\nwith a silvery, crepuscular light. I heard the murmuring and laughing of\nrunning water, the play, I lazily realized, of the fountained pool.\n\nI lay for whole minutes unthinking, luxuriating in the sense of tension\ngone and of security; lay steeped in the aftermath of complete rest.\nMemory flooded me.\n\nQuietly I sat up; Ruth still slept, breathing peacefully beneath the\ncloak, one white arm stretched over the shoulder of Drake--as though in\nher sleep she had drawn close to him.\n\nAt her feet lay Ventnor, as deep in slumber as they. I arose and\ntip-toed over to the closed door.\n\nSearching, I found its key; a cupped indentation upon which I pressed.\n\nThe crystalline panel slipped back; it was moved, I suppose, by some\nmechanism of counterbalances responding to the weight of the hand.\nIt must have been some vibration of the thunder which had loosed that\nmechanism and had closed the panel upon the heels of our entrance--so I\nthought--then seeing again in memory that uncanny, deliberate shutting\nwas not at all convinced that it had been the thunder.\n\nI looked out. How many hours the sun had been up there was no means of\nknowing.\n\nThe sky was low and slaty gray; a fine rain was falling. I stepped out.\n\nThe garden of Norhala was a wreckage of uprooted and splintered trees\nand torn masses of what had been blossoming verdure.\n\nThe gateway of the precipices beyond which lay the Pit was hidden in the\nwebs of the rain. Long I gazed down the canyon--and longingly; striving\nto picture what the Pit now held; eager to read the riddles of the\nnight.\n\nThere came from the valley no sound, no movement, no light.\n\nI reentered the blue globe and paused on the threshold--staring into\nthe wide and wondering eyes of Ruth bolt upright in her silken bed\nwith Norhala's cloak clutched to her chin like a suddenly awakened and\nstartled child. As she glimpsed me she stretched out her hand. Drake,\nwide awake on the instant, leaped to his feet, his hand jumping to his\npistol.\n\n\"Dick!\" called Ruth, her voice tremulous, sweet.\n\nHe swung about, looked deep into the clear and fearless brown eyes in\nwhich--with leaping heart I realized it--was throned only that spirit\nwhich was Ruth's and Ruth's alone; Ruth's clear unshadowed eyes glad and\nshy and soft with love.\n\n\"Dick!\" she whispered, and held soft arms out to him. The cloak fell\nfrom her. He swung her up. Their lips met.\n\nUpon them, embraced, the wakening eyes of Ventnor dwelt; they filled\nwith relief and joy, nor was there lacking in them a certain amusement.\n\nShe drew from Drake's arms, pushed him from her, stood for a moment\nshakily, with covered eyes.\n\n\"Ruth,\" called Ventnor softly.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried. \"Oh, Martin--I forgot--\" She ran to him, held him\ntight, face hidden in his breast. His hand rested on the clustering\nbrown curls, tenderly.\n\n\"Martin.\" She raised her face to him. \"Martin, it's GONE! I'm--ME again!\nAll ME! What happened? Where's Norhala?\"\n\nI started. Did she not know? Of course, lying bound as she had in the\nvanished veils, she could have seen nothing of the stupendous tragedy\nenacted beyond them--but had not Ventnor said that possessed by the\ninexplicable obsession evoked by the weird woman Ruth had seen with her\neyes, thought with her mind?\n\nAnd had there not been evidence that in her body had been echoed the\ntorments of Norhala's? Had she forgotten? I started to speak--was\nchecked by Ventnor's swift, warning glance.\n\n\"She's--over in the Pit,\" he answered her quietly. \"But do you remember\nnothing, little sister?\"\n\n\"There's something in my mind that's been rubbed out,\" she replied.\n\"I remember the City of Cherkis--and your torture, Martin--and my\ntorture--\"\n\nHer face whitened; Ventnor's brow contracted anxiously. I knew for what\nhe watched--but Ruth's shamed face was all human; on it was no shadow\nnor trace of that alien soul which so few hours since had threatened us.\n\n\"Yes,\" she nodded, \"I remember that. And I remember how Norhala\nrepaid them. I remember that I was glad, fiercely glad, and then I was\ntired--so tired. And then--I come to the rubbed-out place,\" she ended\nperplexedly.\n\nDeliberately, almost banally had I not realized his purpose, he changed\nthe subject. He held her from him at arm's length.\n\n\"Ruth!\" he exclaimed, half mockingly, half reprovingly. \"Don't you think\nyour morning negligee is just a little scanty even for this Godforsaken\ncorner of the earth?\"\n\nLips parted in sheer astonishment, she looked at him. Then her eyes\ndropped to her bare feet, her dimpled knees. She clasped her arms across\nher breasts; rosy red turned all her fair skin.\n\n\"Oh!\" she gasped. \"Oh!\" And hid from Drake and me behind the tall figure\nof her brother.\n\nI walked over to the pile of silken stuffs, took the cloak and tossed it\nto her. Ventnor pointed to the saddlebags.\n\n\"You've another outfit there, Ruth,\" he said. \"We'll take a turn through\nthe place. Call us when you're ready. We'll get something to eat and go\nsee what's happening--out there.\"\n\nShe nodded. We passed through the curtains and out of the hall into the\nchamber that had been Norhala's. There we halted, Drake eyeing Martin\nwith a certain embarrassment. The older man thrust out his hand to him.\n\n\"I knew it, Drake,\" he said. \"Ruth told me all about it when Cherkis had\nus. And I'm very glad. It's time she was having a home of her own and\nnot running around the lost places with me. I'll miss her--miss her\ndamnably, of course. But I'm glad, boy--glad!\"\n\nThere was a little silence while each looked deep into each other's\nhearts. Then Ventnor dropped Dick's hand.\n\n\"And that's all of THAT,\" he said. \"The problem before us is--how are we\ngoing to get back home?\"\n\n\"The--THING--is dead.\" I spoke from an absolute conviction that\nsurprised me, based as it was upon no really tangible, known evidence.\n\n\"I think so,\" he said. \"No--I KNOW so. Yet even if we can pass over its\nbody, how can we climb out of its lair? That slide down which we rode\nwith Norhala is unclimbable. The walls are unscalable. And there is that\nchasm--she--spanned for us. How can we cross THAT? The tunnel to the\nruins was sealed. There remains of possible roads the way through the\nforest to what was the City of Cherkis. Frankly I am loathe to take it.\n\n\"I am not at all sure that all the armored men were slain--that some few\nmay not have escaped and be lurking there. It would be short shrift for\nus if we fell into their hands now.\"\n\n\"And I'm not sure of THAT,\" objected Drake. \"I think their pep and push\nmust be pretty thoroughly knocked out--if any do remain. I think if\nthey saw us coming they'd beat it so fast that they'd smoke with the\nfriction.\"\n\n\"There's something to that,\" Ventnor smiled. \"Still I'm not keen on\ntaking the chance. At any rate, the first thing to do is to see what\nhappened down there in the Pit. Maybe we'll have some other idea after\nthat.\"\n\n\"I know what happened there,\" announced Drake, surprisingly. \"It was a\nshort circuit!\"\n\nWe gaped at him, mystified.\n\n\"Burned out!\" said Drake. \"Every damned one of them--burned out. What\nwere they, after all? A lot of living dynamos. Dynamotors--rather.\nAnd all of a sudden they had too much juice turned on. Bang went their\ninsulations--whatever they were.\n\n\"Bang went they. Burned out--short circuited. I don't pretend to know\nwhy or how. Nonsense! I do know. The cones were some kind of immensely\nconcentrated force--electric, magnetic; either or both or more. I myself\nbelieve that they were probably solid--in a way of speaking--coronium.\n\n\"If about twenty of the greatest scientists the world has ever known\nare right, coronium is--well, call it curdled energy. The electric\npotentiality of Niagara in a pin point of dust of yellow fire. All\nright--they or IT lost control. Every pin point swelled out into a\nNiagara. And as it did so, it expanded from a controlled dust dot to\nan uncontrolled cataract--in other words, its energy was unleashed and\nundammed.\n\n\"Very well--what followed? What HAD to follow? Every living battery of\nblock and globe and spike was supercharged and went--blooey. The valley\nmust have been some sweet little volcano while that short circuiting\nwas going on. All right--let's go down and see what it did to your\nunclimbable slide and unscalable walls, Ventnor. I'm not sure we won't\nbe able to get out that way.\"\n\n\"Come on; everything's ready,\" Ruth was calling; her summoning blocked\nany objection we might have raised to Drake's argument.\n\nIt was no dryad, no distressed pagan clad maid we saw as we passed back\ninto the room of the pool. In knickerbockers and short skirt, prim and\nself-possessed, rebellious curls held severely in place by close-fitting\ncap and slender feet stoutly shod, Ruth hovered over the steaming kettle\nswung above the spirit lamp.\n\nAnd she was very silent as we hastily broke fast. Nor when we had\nfinished did she go to Drake. She clung close to her brother and beside\nhim as we set forth down the roadway, through the rain, toward the ledge\nbetween the cliffs where the veils had shimmered.\n\nHotter and hotter it grew as we advanced; the air steamed like a Turkish\nbath. The mists clustered so thickly that at last we groped forward step\nby step, holding to each other.\n\n\"No use,\" gasped Ventnor. \"We couldn't see. We'll have to turn back.\"\n\n\"Burned out!\" said Dick. \"Didn't I tell you? The whole valley was a\nvolcano. And with that deluge falling in it--why wouldn't there be a\nfog? It's why there IS a fog. We'll have to wait until it clears.\"\n\nWe trudged back to the blue globe.\n\nAll that day the rain fell. Throughout the few remaining hours of\ndaylight we wandered over the house of Norhala, examining its most\ninteresting contents, or sat theorizing, discussing all phases of the\nphenomena we had witnessed.\n\nWe told Ruth what had occurred after she had thrown in her lot with\nNorhala; and of the enigmatic struggle between the glorious Disk and the\nsullenly flaming Thing I have called the Keeper.\n\nWe told her of the entombment of Norhala.\n\nWhen she heard that she wept.\n\n\"She was sweet,\" she sobbed; \"she was lovely. And she was beautiful.\nDearly she loved me. I KNOW she loved me. Oh, I know that we and ours\nand that which was hers could not share the world together. But it comes\nto me that Earth would have been far less poisonous with those that were\nNorhala's than it is with us and ours!\"\n\nWeeping, she passed through the curtainings, going we knew to Norhala's\nchamber.\n\nIt was a strange thing indeed that she had said, I thought, watching her\ngo. That the garden of the world would be far less poisonous blossoming\nwith those Things of wedded crystal and metal and magnetic fires\nthan fertile as now with us of flesh and blood and bone. To me came\nappreciations of their harmonies, and mingled with those perceptions\nwere others of humanity--disharmonious, incoordinate, ever struggling,\never striving to destroy itself--\n\nThere was a plaintive whinnying at the open door. A long and hairy face,\na pair of patient, inquiring eyes looked in. It was a pony. For a moment\nit regarded us--and then trotted trustfully through; ambled up to us;\npoked its head against my side.\n\nIt had been ridden by one of the Persians whom Ruth had killed, for\nunder it, slipped from the girths, a saddle dangled. And its owner must\nhave been kind to it--we knew that from its lack of fear for us. Driven\nby the tempest of the night before, it had been led back by instinct to\nthe protection of man.\n\n\"Some luck!\" breathed Drake.\n\nHe busied himself with the pony, stripping away the hanging saddle,\ngrooming it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. SLAG!\n\nThat night we slept well. Awakening, we found that the storm had grown\nviolent again; the wind roaring and the rain falling in such volume\nthat it was impossible to make our way to the Pit. Twice, as a matter of\nfact, we tried; but the smooth roadway was a torrent, and, drenched even\nthrough our oils to the skin, we at last abandoned the attempt. Ruth and\nDrake drifted away together among the other chambers of the globe; they\nwere absorbed in themselves, and we did not thrust ourselves upon them.\nAll the day the torrents fell.\n\nWe sat down that night to what was well-nigh the last of Ventnor's\nstores. Seemingly Ruth had forgotten Norhala; at least, she spoke no\nmore of her.\n\n\"Martin,\" she said, \"can't we start back tomorrow? I want to get away. I\nwant to get back to our own world.\"\n\n\"As soon as the storm ceases, Ruth,\" he answered, \"we start. Little\nsister--I too want you to get back quickly.\"\n\nThe next morning the storm had gone. We awakened soon after dawn into\nclear and brilliant light. We had a silent and hurried breakfast. The\nsaddlebags were packed and strapped upon the pony. Within them were what\nwe could carry of souvenirs from Norhala's home--a suit of lacquered\narmor, a pair of cloaks and sandals, the jeweled combs. Ruth and Drake\nat the side of the pony, Ventnor and I leading, we set forth toward the\nPit.\n\n\"We'll probably have to come back, Walter,\" he said. \"I don't believe\nthe place is passable.\"\n\nI pointed--we were then just over the threshold of the elfin globe.\nWhere the veils had stretched between the perpendicular pillars of the\ncliffs was now a wide and ragged-edged opening.\n\nThe roadway which had run so smoothly through the scarps was blocked\nby a thousand foot barrier. Over it, beyond it, I could see through the\ncrystalline clarity of the air the opposing walls.\n\n\"We can climb it,\" Ventnor said. We passed on and reached the base\nof the barrier. An avalanche had dropped there; the barricade was the\ndebris of the torn cliffs, their dust, their pebbles, their boulders. We\ntoiled up; we reached the crest; we looked down upon the valley.\n\nWhen first we had seen it we had gazed upon a sea of radiance pierced\nwith lanced forests, swept with gigantic gonfalons of flame; we had seen\nit emptied of its fiery mists--a vast slate covered with the chirography\nof a mathematical god; we had seen it filled with the symboling of the\nMetal Hordes and dominated by the colossal integrate hieroglyph of the\nliving City; we had seen it as a radiant lake over which brooded weird\nsuns; a lake of yellow flame froth upon which a sparkling hail fell,\nwithin which reared islanded towers and a drowning mount running with\ncataracts of sun fires; here we had watched a goddess woman, a being\nhalf of earth, half of the unknown immured within a living tomb--a\ndying tomb--of flaming mysteries; had seen a cross-shaped metal Satan, a\nsullen flaming crystal Judas betray--itself.\n\nWhere we had peered into the unfathomable, had glimpsed the infinite,\nhad heard and had seen the inexplicable, now was--\n\nSlag!\n\nThe amethystine ring from which had been streamed the circling veils was\ncracked and blackened; like a seam of coal it had stretched around the\nPit--a crown of mourning. The veils were gone. The floor of the valley\nwas fissured and blackened; its patterns, its writings burned away. As\nfar as we could see stretched a sea of slag--coal black, vitrified and\ndead.\n\nHere and there black hillocks sprawled; huge pillars arose, bent and\ntwisted as though they had been jettings of lava cooled into rigidity\nbefore they could sink back or break. These shapes clustered most\nthickly around an immense calcified mound. They were what were left of\nthe battling Hordes, and the mound was what had been the Metal Monster.\n\nSomewhere there were the ashes of Norhala, sealed by fire in the urn of\nthe Metal Emperor!\n\nFrom side to side of the Pit, in broken beaches and waves and hummocks,\nin blackened, distorted tusks and warped towerings, reaching with\nhideous pathos in thousands of forms toward the charred mound, was only\nslag.\n\nFrom rifts and hollows still filled with water little wreaths of steam\ndrifted. In those futile wraiths of vapor was all that remained of the\nmight of the Metal Monster.\n\nCatastrophe I had expected, tragedy I knew we would find--but I had\nlooked for nothing so filled with the abomination of desolation, so\nfrightful as was this.\n\n\"Burned out!\" muttered Drake. \"Short-circuited and burned out! Like a\ndynamo--like an electric light!\"\n\n\"Destiny!\" said Ventnor. \"Destiny! Not yet was the hour struck for man\nto relinquish his sovereignty over the world. Destiny!\"\n\nWe began to pick our way down the heaped debris and out upon the plain.\nFor all that day and part of another we searched for an opening out of\nthe Pit.\n\nEverywhere was the incredible calcification. The surfaces that had\nbeen the smooth metallic carapaces with the tiny eyes deep within them,\ncrumbled beneath the lightest blow. Not long would it be until under\nwind and rain they dissolved into dust and mud.\n\nAnd it grew increasingly obvious that Drake's theory of the destruction\nwas correct. The Monster had been one prodigious magnet--or, rather, a\nprodigious dynamo. By magnetism, by electricity, it had lived and had\nbeen activated.\n\nWhatever the force of which the cones were built and that I have likened\nto energy-made material, it was certainly akin to electromagnetic\nenergies.\n\nWhen, in the cataclysm, that force was diffused there had been created\na magnetic field of incredible intensity; had been concentrated an\nelectric charge of inconceivable magnitude.\n\nDischarging, it had blasted the Monster--short-circuited it, and burned\nit out.\n\nBut what was it that had led up to the cataclysm? What was it that had\nturned the Metal Monster upon itself? What disharmony had crept into\nthat supernal order to set in motion the machinery of disintegration?\n\n\nWe could only conjecture. The cruciform Shape I have named the Keeper\nwas the agent of destruction--of that there could be no doubt. In the\nenigmatic organism which while many still was one and which, retaining\nits integrity as a whole could dissociate manifold parts yet still as a\nwhole maintain an unseen contact and direction over them through miles\nof space, the Keeper had its place, its work, its duties.\n\nSo too had that wondrous Disk whose visible and concentrate power, whose\nmanifest leadership, had made us name it emperor.\n\nAnd had not Norhala called the Disk--Ruler?\n\nWhat were the responsibilities of these twain to the mass of the\norganism of which they were such important units? What were the laws\nthey administered, the laws they must obey?\n\nSomething certainly of that mysterious law which Maeterlinck has called\nthe spirit of the Hive--and something infinitely greater, like that\nwhich governs the swarming sun bees of Hercules' clustered orbs.\n\nHad there evolved within the Keeper of the Cones--guardian and engineer\nas it seemed to have been--ambition?\n\nHad there risen within it a determination to wrest power from the Disk,\nto take its place as Ruler?\n\nHow else explain that conflict I had sensed when the Emperor had plucked\nDrake and me from the Keeper's grip that night following the orgy of the\nfeeding?\n\nHow else explain that duel in the shattered Hall of the Cones whose end\nhad been the signal for the final cataclysm?\n\nHow else explain the alinement of the cubes behind the Keeper against\nthe globes and pyramids remaining loyal to the will of the Disk?\n\nWe discussed this, Ventnor and I.\n\n\"This world,\" he mused, \"is a place of struggle. Air and sea and land\nand all things that dwell within and on them must battle for life. Earth\nnot Mars is the planet of war. I have a theory\"--he hesitated--\"that the\nmagnetic currents which are the nerve force of this globe of ours were\nwhat fed the Metal Things.\n\n\"Within those currents is the spirit of earth. And always they have been\nsupercharged with strife, with hatreds, warfare. Were these drawn in by\nthe Things as they fed? Did it happen that the Keeper became--TUNED--to\nthem? That it absorbed and responded to them, growing even more\nsensitive to these forces--until it reflected humanity?\"\n\n\"Who knows, Goodwin--who can tell?\"\n\nEnigma, unless the explanations I have hazarded be accepted, must remain\nthat monstrous suicide. Enigma, save for inconclusive theories, must\nremain the question of the Monster's origin.\n\nIf answers there were, they were lost forever in the slag we trod.\n\n\nIt was afternoon of the second day that we found a rift in the blasted\nwall of the valley. We decided to try it. We had not dared to take the\nroad by which Norhala had led us into the City.\n\nThe giant slide was broken and climbable. But even if we could have\npassed safely through the tunnel of the abyss there still was left the\nchasm over which we could have thrown no bridge. And if we could have\nbridged it still at that road's end was the cliff whose shaft Norhala\nhad sealed with her lightnings.\n\nSo we entered the rift.\n\nOf our wanderings thereafter I need not write. From the rift we emerged\ninto a maze of the valleys, and after a month in that wilderness, living\nupon what game we could shoot, we found a road that led us into Gyantse.\n\nIn another six weeks we were home in America.\n\nMy story is finished.\n\nThere in the Trans-Himalayan wilderness is the blue globe that was the\nweird home of the lightning witch--and looking back I feel now she could\nnot have been all woman.\n\nThere is the vast pit with its coronet of fantastic peaks; its\nsymboled, calcined floor and the crumbling body of the inexplicable,\nthe incredible Thing which, alive, was the shadow of extinction,\nannihilation, hovering to hurl itself upon humanity. That shadow is\ngone; that pall withdrawn.\n\nBut to me--to each of us four who saw those phenomena--their lesson\nremains, ineradicable; giving a new strength and purpose to us, teaching\nus a new humility.\n\nFor in that vast crucible of life of which we are so small a part, what\nother Shapes may even now be rising to submerge us?\n\nIn that vast reservoir of force that is the mystery-filled infinite\nthrough which we roll, what other shadows may be speeding upon us?\n\nWho knows?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Metal Monster, by A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
