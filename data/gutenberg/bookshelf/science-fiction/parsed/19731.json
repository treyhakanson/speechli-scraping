The lad passed the tool over.\n\n\"Do you think the ship will work, Professor?\" he asked.\n\n\"I hope so, Mark, I hope so,\" muttered the scientist as he tightened\nsome bolts on what was perhaps the strangest combination of apparatus\nthat had ever been put together. \"There is no reason why she should not,\nand yet--\"\n\nThe old man paused. Perhaps he feared that, after all, the submarine\nboat on which he had labored continuously for more than a year would be\na failure.\n\n\"Is there anything more I can do now?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Not right away,\" replied the professor, without looking up from the\nwork he was doing. \"But I wish you and Jack would be around in about an\nhour. I am going to start the engine then, and I'll need you. If you see\nWashington outside send him to me.\"\n\nMark left the big room where the submarine boat had been in process of\nconstruction so long. Outside he met a boy about his own age, who was\ncleaning a rifle.\n\n\"How's it going, Mark?\" asked this second youth, who was rather fat,\nand, if one could judge by his face, of a jolly disposition.\n\n\"The professor is going to try the engine in about an hour,\" replied\nMark. \"We must be on hand.\"\n\n\"I'll be there all right. But if there isn't anything else to do, let's\nshoot at a target. I'll bet I can beat you.\"\n\n\"Bet you can't. Wait 'till I get my gun.\"\n\n\"Now don't yo' boys go to disportin' yo'seves in any disproportionable\nanticipation ob transposin' dem molecules of lead in a contigious\ndirection to yo' humble servant!\" exclaimed a colored man, coming from\nbehind the big shed at that moment, and seeing Mark and Jack with their\nrifles.\n\n\"I s'pose you mean to say, Washington,\" remarked Jack, \"that you don't\ncare to be shot at. Is that it?\"\n\n\"Neber said nuffin truer in all yo' born days!\" exclaimed Washington\nearnestly. \"De infliction ob distress to de exterior portion ob--\"\n\n\"The professor wants you,\" interrupted Mark, cutting off the colored\nman's flow of language.\n\n\"Yo' mind what I tole yo',\" Washington muttered as he hurried into the\nwork room.\n\nSoon the reports of rifles indicated that the boys were trying to\ndiscover who was the best shot, a contest that waged with friendly\ninterest for some time.\n\nThe big shed, where the submarine ship was being built, was located at a\nlonely spot on the coast of Maine. The nearest town was Easton, about\nten miles away, and Professor Henderson had fixed on this location as\none best suited to give him a chance to work secretly and unobserved on\nhis wonderful invention.\n\nThe professor was a man about sixty-five years old, and, while of simple\nand kindly nature in many ways, yet, on the subjects of airships and\nsubmarines, he possessed a fund of knowledge. He was somewhat queer, as\nmany persons may be who devote all their thoughts to one object, yet he\nwas a man of fine character.\n\nSome time before this story opens he had invented an electric airship in\nwhich he, with Mark Sampson, Jack Darrow and the colored man,\nWashington White, had made a trip to the frozen north.\n\nTheir adventures on that journey are told of in the first volume of this\nseries, entitled, \"Through the Air to the North Pole, or, The Wonderful\nCruise of the _Electric Monarch_.\"\n\nThe two boys, Mark then being fifteen and Jack a year older, had met the\nprofessor under peculiar circumstances. They were orphans, and, after\nknocking about the world a bit, had chanced to meet each other. They\nagreed to seek together such fortune as might chance to come to them.\n\nWhile in the town of Freeport, N. Y., they were driven away by a\nconstable, who said tramps were not allowed in the village. The boys\njumped on a freight train, which broke in two and ran away down the\nmountain, and the lads were knocked senseless in the wreck that\nfollowed.\n\nAs it chanced Professor Henderson had erected nearby a big shop, where\nhe was building his airship. He and Washington were on hand when the\nwreck occurred and they took the senseless boys to the airship shed.\n\nThe boys, after their recovery, accepted the invitation of the professor\nto go on a search for the north pole. As the airship was about to start\nAndy Sudds, an old hunter, and two men, Tom Smith and Bill Jones, who\nhad been called in to assist at the flight, held on too long and were\ncarried aloft.\n\nSomewhat against their will the three latter made the trip, for the\nprofessor did not want to return to earth with them.\n\nThe party had many adventures on the voyage, having to fight savage\nanimals and more savage Esquimaux. They reached the north pole, but in\nthe midst of such a violent storm that the ship was overturned, and the\ndiscovery of the long-sought goal availed little. After many hardships,\nand a fierce fight to recover the possession of the ship, which had been\nseized by natives, the adventurers reached home.\n\nSince then a little over a year had passed. The professor, having found\nhe could successfully navigate the air, turned his attention to the\nwater, and began to plan a craft that would sail beneath the ocean.\n\nTo this end he had moved his machine shop to this lonely spot on the\nMaine coast. The two boys, who had grown no less fond of the old man\nthan he of them, went with him, as did Washington White, the negro, who\nwas a genius in his way, though somewhat inclined to use big words, of\nthe meaning of which he knew little and cared less.\n\nAndy Sudds, the old hunter, had also been induced to accompany the\nprofessor.\n\n\"I hunted game up north and in the air,\" said Andy, \"and if there's a\nchance to shoot something under the water I'm the one to do it.\"\n\nNeeding more assistance than either the boys, Andy or Washington could\ngive, the professor had engaged two young machinists, who, under a\nstrict promise never to divulge any of the secrets of the submarine, had\nlabored in its building.\n\nNow the queer craft was almost finished. As it rested on the ways in the\nshed, it looked exactly like a big cigar, excepting that the top part\nwas level, forming a platform.\n\nThe ship, which had been named the _Porpoise_, was eighty feet long, and\ntwenty feet in diameter at the largest part. From that it tapered\ngradually, until the ends were reached. These consisted of flattened\nplates about three feet in diameter, with a hole in the center one foot\nin size.\n\nWeary months of labor had been spent on the _Porpoise_, until now it was\nalmost ready for a trial. The professor had discovered a new method of\npropulsion. Instead of propellers or paddle-wheels, he intended to send\nhis craft ahead or to the rear, by means of a water cable.\n\nThrough the entire length of the ship ran a round hole or shaft, one\nfoot in diameter. Within this was an endless screw worked by powerful\nengines. With a working model the professor had demonstrated that when\nthe endless screw was revolved it acted on the water just as another\nsort of screw does in wood. The water coming in through the shaft served\nas a rope, so to speak, and the screw, acting on it, pulled the craft\nahead or to the rear, according to the direction in which the screw was\nrevolved.\n\nThe submarine was a wonderful craft. It contained a powerful engine,\nelectric motors and dynamos, and machinery of all kinds. The engine was\na turbine, and steam was generated from heat furnished by the burning of\na powerful gas, manufactured from sea water and chemicals. So there was\nno need to carry a supply of coal on the ship.\n\nThe interior of the vessel was divided into an engine-room, a kitchen,\ncombination dining-room and parlor, bunk rooms, and a conning tower, or\nplace for the steersman.\n\nWhile the boys had been shooting at the target the professor and\nWashington had been putting the finishing touches to the engine,\ntightening nuts here and screwed up bolts there.\n\n\"I guess that will do,\" remarked the old inventor. \"Call the boys,\nWashington.\"\n\nThe colored man went to the door and gave three blasts on a battered\nhorn that hung from a string.\n\n\"Coming!\" called Mark, as he and Jack ceased their marksmanship contest\nand approached the shed.\n\n\"Now boys, we'll see if she works so far,\" said the professor. \"If she\ndoes, we'll give her a trial under water.\"\n\nAt the inventor's directions the boys started the gas to generating from\nthe chemicals. Soon the hissing of steam told them that there was power\nin the boiler.\n\nThe professor entered the engine-room of the submarine. He looked over\nthe various wheels, levers, handles, gages and attachments, satisfying\nhimself that all were in proper shape and position.\n\n\"Three hundred pounds pressure,\" he muttered, glancing at the steam\nindicator. \"That ought to be enough. Are you all ready, boys?\"\n\n\"All ready!\" cried Jack.\n\nOf course the test was only one to see if the engine worked, for the\nboat could not move until in the water.\n\nThe professor opened a valve. The steam filled the turbine with a hiss\nand throb. The _Porpoise_ trembled. Then, with a cough and splutter of\nthe exhaust pipes, the engine started. Slowly it went at first, but, as\nthe professor admitted more steam, it revolved the long screw until it\nfairly hummed in the shaft.\n\n\"Hurrah! It works!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"It does!\" chimed in Jack.\n\n\"Gollyation! She suttinly am goin'!\" yelled Washington.\n\n\"I think we may say it is a success,\" said the professor calmly, yet\nthere was a note of exultation in his voice.\n\n\"Now that you've got her started, when are you goin' to put her in the\nwater an' scoot along under the waves?\" asked Andy Sudds.\n\n\"In about a week,\" replied the professor.\n\n\"And where are you goin' to head for?\" went on the hunter.\n\n\"We're going under the ocean to the south pole!\" exclaimed the inventor,\nas he shut off the engine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA LAND OF ICE\n\n\n\"The south pole?\" exclaimed Mark.\n\n\"Way down dat way!\" cried Washington.\n\n\"Can you do it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" replied the professor, answering them all at\nonce. \"I'm going to try, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" yelled Mark. \"It will be better than going to the north pole,\nfor we will be in no danger of freezing to death.\"\n\n\"Don't be so sure of that,\" interrupted the professor. \"There is more\nice at the south pole than at the north, according to all accounts. It\nis a place of great icebergs, immense floes and cold fogs. But there is\nland beyond the ice, I believe, and I am going to try to find it.\"\n\n\"It will be a longer voyage than to the north pole,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Jest de same,\" argued Washington, \"de poles am at each end ob de\nworld.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we're quite a way north of the equator now, and we'll have to\ncross that before we will be half way to the south pole,\" explained\nJack. \"But I guess the _Porpoise_ can make good time.\"\n\n\"If the engine behaves under water as well as it did just now, we'll\nskim along,\" said the professor.\n\n\"And so you figure there's land down there to the south, do you?\" asked\nold Andy.\n\n\"I do,\" replied the inventor. \"I can't prove it, but I'm sure there is.\nI have read all the accounts of other explorers and from the signs they\nmention I am positive we shall find land if we ever get there. Land and\nan open sea.\"\n\n\"And other things as well,\" muttered Andy, yet neither he nor any of\nthem dreamed of the terrible and strange adventures they were to have.\n\nThe next few days were busy ones. Many little details remained to\nperfect in connection with the ship, and a lot of supplies and\nprovisions had to be purchased, for the professor was determined to get\nall in readiness for the trip under the water. He believed firmly that\nhis ship would work, though some of the others were not so positive.\n\n\"We'll put her into the water to-morrow,\" announced the inventor after\nsupper one night. \"Everything is complete as far as I can make it, and\nthe only thing remaining is to see if she will float, sink when I want\nher to, and, what is most important, rise to the surface again. For,\"\nhe added with a twinkle in his eye, \"anybody can make a ship that will\nsink, but it isn't every one who can make one that will come to the\nsurface again.\"\n\n\"Golly! I hope dis chile ain't goin' to git in no subicecream ship\nwhat'll stay down under de water so de fishes gits him!\" exclaimed\nWashington, opening his eyes wide. \"Dat's worser dan freezin!\"\n\n\"Can't you swim?\" asked Mark with a wink at Jack.\n\n\"Co'se I can swim, boy. I can swim like a starfish, but I can't wif ten\nthousand tons of a subicecream ship on my back.\"\n\n\"A sub-ice-cream ship is a new one,\" commented the professor with a\nsmile. \"It's a submarine, Washington.\"\n\n\"I can't see no difference,\" persisted the colored man. \"Subicecream am\ngood enough for me.\"\n\nThat night Mark and Jack were thinking so much of the proposed test of\nthe ship the next day that they each dreamed they were sailing beneath\nthe waves, and Jack woke Mark up by grabbing him about the neck during a\nparticularly vivid part of the vision.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Mark, sleepily.\n\n\"I thought the ship turned over and spilled me out and I was drowning,\"\nexplained Jack. \"I grabbed the first thing I got hold of and it happened\nto be you.\"\n\n\"Well, as long as you're safe you can go to sleep again,\" said Mark. \"I\ndreamed I was chasing a whale with the _Porpoise_.\"\n\nThe boys were up early the next morning, and found the professor and\nWashington before them. The inventor was inspecting the track which had\nbeen built from the shed down to the water's edge to enable the\n_Porpoise_ to slide into the ocean.\n\nWith him were the two machinists, Henry Watson and James Penson. They\nhad been busy since daylight making the ways secure.\n\n\"She goes in after breakfast,\" announced the professor, \"and I'm going\nto let you christen her, Washington.\"\n\n\"Me? I neber christened a ship,\" objected the colored man.\n\n\"Nothing like learning,\" remarked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Has you got the bottle ob wine?\" asked Washington.\n\n\"I guess soda water will do,\" said the inventor. \"Now look sharp, boys.\nGet your breakfasts and we'll see if the ship will come up to our\nexpectations.\"\n\nNo one lingered over the meal. When it was finished the professor gave\nWashington a few instructions about breaking the bottle over the nose of\nthe _Porpoise_ as she slid down to the water, for there was no bow to\nsuch a queerly shaped vessel as the submarine.\n\nAt last all was in readiness. The two machinists knocked away the last\nof the retaining blocks and eased the ship slightly down the\nwell-greased timbers of the ways.\n\n\"There she goes!\" cried the professor. \"Break the bottle, Washington!\"\n\n\"In de name ob de Stars an' Stripes, in de name of liberty, de home of\nthe free an' de land ob de brave, I names yo' _Mrs. Porpoise_!\" cried\nthe colored man, but he was so long getting the words out, and so slow\nin swinging the bottle of soda, that the ship was quite beyond his reach\nwhen he had finished his oration. He was not to be outdone, however,\nand, with a quick movement he hurled the bottle at the moving ship. It\nstruck the blunt nose squarely, and shivered to pieces.\n\n\"Three cheers for de south pole!\" yelled Washington, and the others\njoined in.\n\nThe next instant the _Porpoise_ was riding the waves of the little bay,\ndancing about as lightly as a cork, though, from the nature of her\nconstruction, she was quite low in the water, only about three feet of\nfreeboard showing where the platform was located.\n\n\"Well, she floats, anyhow,\" remarked the professor. \"Row out and fasten\ncables fore and aft,\" he went on, turning to the two machinists. In a\nfew minutes the _Porpoise_ was fastened to a small dock with strong\nropes the two young men had carried out to her in rowboats.\n\n\"We will go aboard in a little while,\" the professor said. \"I am anxious\nto see if she rides on an even keel and how the sinking tanks work.\"\n\nAided by the boys, he and Washington carried on board a number of tools\nand appliances. Then, with the two machinists, they all descended into\nthe interior of the craft through the small manhole in the middle of the\ndeck or platform.\n\nInside the _Porpoise_, the greater part of which was below the surface\nof the waves and consequently in darkness, the professor switched on the\nelectric lights and then he proceeded to get up steam.\n\nThe propelling power of the craft has already been described. In order\nto make the ship sink beneath the water all that was necessary was to\nincline the rudder and open certain valves in the four tanks, when the\nwater, rushing in, would sink her. There was a tank on either side, and\none each fore and aft. If it was desired to sink straight down all four\ntanks were filled at once. If the professor wanted to descend slanting\neither to the front or back, only one of the end tanks was filled,\naccording to the direction desired. The deflecting rudder also aided\ngreatly in this movement.\n\nTo cause the ship to rise the tanks were emptied of the water by means\nof powerful pumps. The filling of the tanks, as well as the emptying of\nthem, the starting or stopping of the engine that moved the boat, as\nwell as the control of most of the important machinery on the craft\ncould be accomplished from the conning or steering tower, as well as\nfrom the engine-room.\n\nThere were numerous gages to tell the depth to which the ship had sunk,\nthe steam pressure, density of the water, and other necessary details.\n\nThere were dynamos to make light, motors to run the pumps, and a great\nstorage battery, so that in case of a breakdown to the turbine engine\nthe craft could be run entirely by electricity for a time.\n\nThe cooking was all done by this useful current, and all that was\nnecessary to make a cup of coffee or fry a beefsteak was to turn a small\nswitch of the electric stove.\n\nThe professor was busy over the machine for generating gas, that\nfurnished the heat to create steam. Soon a hissing told that it was\nworking. In a few minutes the hum and throb of the engine told that it\nwas ready to start.\n\n\"We are only going down a little way,\" the professor said, \"and only\ngoing to travel a short distance under water for the first time. I think\nthere is no danger, but if any of you want to back out, now is your\nchance.\"\n\nNo one seemed inclined to withdraw, though Mark said afterward he\nthought Washington got as pale as it is possible for a colored man to\nget.\n\n\"We will all put on life preservers,\" the inventor went on, \"and one of\nyou will be stationed near the emergency exit. In case anything goes\nwrong, and I cannot make the ship rise, by pulling the lever the top of\nthe craft will be forced off, and, we can at least save our lives. I\nthink we are all ready now. Mark, you clamp down the manhole cover, and\nJack, after you close the conning tower station yourself at the\nemergency lever after we have donned the life preservers.\"\n\nThe cork jackets were adjusted and Mark clamped the manhole cover on.\nThe professor took one last look at the various levers and handles, and\nthen turned the wheel that admitted water to all four tanks. There was a\nhissing sound as the sea water rushed in, and the _Porpoise_ gave a\nsudden lurch.\n\nThen they could all feel the submarine sinking. Down and down she went.\nWould she ever stop? Would the professor be able to raise her again?\nThere were questions that troubled everyone.\n\nDown and down the craft sunk, until by the gage it was indicated that\nshe was twenty feet below the surface. Then the professor shut off the\ninrush of water and the _Porpoise_ floated away below the surface of the\nwaves.\n\nThere was a clicking sound and all the lights went out. The boys and\nWashington gave a gasp of terror. What did the sudden blackness mean.\n\n\"Open the side windows,\" called the professor's voice, and the two\nmachinists obeyed. Heavy steel doors that covered plate glass windows in\neither side of the craft were pulled back, and a cry of astonishment\nbroke from the boys.\n\nThey looked out and saw staring in at them, so close it seemed that they\ncould touch them, scores of fishes that looked in through the glass\nbull's-eyes.\n\nFor the first time they realized that they were in the depths of the\nocean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nRUNNING DOWN A WARSHIP\n\n\n\"How do you like it?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"Great!\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"Fine!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"It am simply coslostrousness!\" exploded Washington. \"'Nebber in all my\nborn days did I eber expansionate on such a sight!\"\n\n\"Wish I had a fishing pole and line,\" remarked Andy Sudds. \"There's some\npretty nice specimens out there.\"\n\n\"You'll see better ones than those before we finish our trip to the\npole,\" remarked the professor. \"Now we will try moving forward. I am\ngoing into the conning tower.\"\n\nHe turned on the lights once more, but the boys begged him to shut them\noff, as they could see out into the ocean when the interior of the ship\nwas in darkness. So the professor obliged them.\n\nIn the tower he switched on the powerful searchlight that illuminated\nthe path in front of him. Then he started the engine, slowly at first,\nand gradually increasing the speed. The _Porpoise_ forged ahead, riding\nas evenly as an ordinary ship does on the surface.\n\nThe professor steered her about in a large circle, bringing her back to\nthe starting point. She worked as smoothly as if she had been used to\nunder-water service for years.\n\n\"Now,\" said the inventor, \"we will see if we can go up to the surface\nagain,\" and there came a little note of anxiety into his voice. He\nslowed down the engine and started the powerful pumps that were to empty\nthe tanks. For a moment there was a feeling of terror in the hearts of\nall. Would the pumps work?\n\nThen, slowly but surely, those aboard the _Porpoise_ felt her beginning\nto rise. Up and up she went as the tanks were emptied and the ship\nlightened.\n\nThen, with a bounce like a rubber ball, the submarine shot upward to the\nsurface and lay undulating on the waves caused by her emergence from the\ndepths.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Jack. \"We're all right!\"\n\n\"We shore am!\" exclaimed Washington.\n\n\"It's a success!\" Professor Henderson almost whispered. \"The pumps\nworked. The _Porpoise_ has fulfilled my greatest expectations!\"\n\nThen he steered the ship back to the dock, where she was moored, and the\nadventurers disembarked.\n\n\"One or two little details to attend to, and we'll be ready for the\ngreat trip,\" remarked the professor. \"I want to give her a little harder\ntrial before I trust her, though she seems to be first-rate.\"\n\nThey all went back to the combined machine shop and cabin, where they\nhad lived during the building of the submarine. Dinner was prepared and,\nafter the meal the two machinists approached the professor.\n\n\"I don't suppose you need us any more,\" remarked Henry Watson. \"The ship\nis finished as far as we can do anything, and we may as well leave now.\nWe have an offer to go to work in an electrical shop.\"\n\n\"I haven't said much to you about my plans,\" the professor replied, \"but\nif you would like to remain in my employ, I can promise you an\ninteresting trip.\"\n\n\"Thank you, but I prefer to work above ground,\" said James Pensen. \"You\nhave been very kind to us, and we would do anything we could for, but we\ndon't want to take any long under-ocean trips if we can help it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered the professor, though he seemed disappointed. \"I\nwill pay you what I owe you and you can go.\"\n\nFor some time after the departure of the two young machinists the\ninventor seemed worried.\n\n\"Did you count on them staying with you?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I rather hoped they would,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"We need two more\nhands if we are to make the trip. They need not be machinists, but we\nwill have to have someone, and I don't like to get strangers. They might\ntalk too much about the ship.\"\n\nAt that instant there came a rap on the door. Washington answered it.\n\n\"Yas sir, Perfesser Henderson done lib here,\" he replied, in answer to a\nquestion from some one. \"But he am bery busy jest at de present\noccasioness an' he'll be most extremely discommodated if yo' obtrude yo'\npresence on him at de conglomeration ob de statutory limitations, which\nam to say right now. Come again!\"\n\n\"It's the same old Washington!\" said someone outside, laughing heartily.\n\"Just you tell the professor we want to see him most particular.\"\n\nAt the sound of the voice the professor started and Mark and Jack\nwondered where they had heard it before.\n\n\"Show the gentlemen in, Washington,\" called the inventor.\n\n\"Dere's two ob 'em,\" objected the colored man.\n\n\"Show them both in, then.\"\n\nWashington opened the door of the cabin, and in came two men, who\nseemed much amused over something.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" asked the professor, in rather a sharp voice.\n\n\"He don't know us either, Tom,\" remarked the taller of the two.\n\n\"If it ain't Bill Jones and Tom Smith!\" exclaimed Andy Sudds. \"Wa'al\nI'll be horn swoggled. Where'd ye come from?\"\n\n\"Right from the farm,\" replied Bill. \"And we've had a hard job locating\nyou. I guess Washington didn't know us since we raised beards,\" and Bill\nstroked his wealth of brown whiskers.\n\n\"And I guess we sort of fooled the professor,\" went on Bill, \"eh, Tom?\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Tom. \"You see,\" he went on, \"the farming business is\nalmost over, as its coming on fall now, so Bill and I thought it would\nbe a good time to hunt up the professor. We heard he was down in this\nneighborhood so we come by easy stages. We didn't have any time to stop\nand make our toilets, hence our beards.\"\n\n\"You've come at the right time,\" remarked the inventor, as he came\nforward to welcome the two young men. \"Do you remember the trip you made\nwith me to the north pole?\"\n\n\"I guess we'll not forget it in a hurry,\" replied Bill.\n\n\"That's what made us hunt you up,\" put in Tom. \"We hoped you might have\nsomething similar on foot.\"\n\n\"I have,\" answered the inventor.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"A trip under the ocean!\"\n\nFor an instant the two young men hesitated. It was a new proposition to\nthem. Yet they recalled that they had come safely back from the journey\nthrough the air.\n\n\"Do you want to go along as part of the crew?\" asked the inventor, after\nsome further conversation.\n\n\"You can count on me!\" cried Bill.\n\n\"And if Bill goes I'll go too!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\n\"Under the seas or over the seas, it'll be all one to us if Professor\nHenderson sails the ship!\" went on Bill. \"We'll go!\"\n\n\"Good!\" ejaculated the professor. \"You certainly came at just the right\ntime.\"\n\nAs Tom Smith and Bill Jones were hungry a hasty meal was prepared for\nthem, during the eating of which they told of their experiences since\nlanding from the airship. They had been on a farm until fired with a\ndesire to go roving once more.\n\nFor the next few days the professor, the boys, and the other four were\nbusy making some improvements to the _Porpoise_. Tom and Bill were much\nastonished at their first sight of the queer craft, but they soon became\naccustomed to her, and said they preferred her to the airship.\n\n\"To-morrow we are going on a little longer trip than our first trial,\"\nannounced the inventor one evening. \"We will be gone all day if nothing\nhappens to make the stay more lengthy,\" he added grimly. \"So,\nWashington, put plenty to eat aboard.\"\n\nA little later, when supplies had been put on the _Porpoise_, and the\nmachinery well overhauled, the professor explained that he intended\nmaking a trip, entirely under water, from the dock in the cove to a\npoint off the Massachusetts coast and return.\n\nEarly the next morning all were aboard. To each one was assigned a\nparticular station. Washington, with Mark as an assistant, was in the\nengine-room. Jack was to watch the various gages and registers to give\nwarning of any danger. The professor, of course, would be in the conning\ntower and operate the craft. Andy was to be with him, to watch out, with\nhis sharp eyes, for any danger that might loom up in the path of the\nsearchlight. Tom and Bill were to be ready to help where needed.\n\nWith a hissing sound the water filled the tanks and the _Porpoise_ sunk\nbeneath the waves. The engine that worked the endless screw was\nstarted, and the threads, working on the water cable, shot the boat\nahead.\n\n\"We're off!\" yelled Washington.\n\nAbout sixty feet below the surface the craft was sent along. Mile after\nmile was covered as shown by the patent log. The lights were turned off,\nand through the thick plate glass windows the strange inhabitants of the\nsea were observed.\n\n\"I think I'll go a little nearer the surface,\" said the professor to\nAndy. The inventor started the pumps that emptied the tanks. The craft\nrose slightly.\n\n\"Quick! Stop her!\" shouted the old hunter, grasping the captain's arm.\n\nSomething black, like a grim shadow, loomed up in the dull glare of the\nsearchlight.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried the professor.\n\n\"We're goin' to hit somethin' hard!\" yelled Andy.\n\n\"It's the hull of a ship!\" exclaimed the inventor as he jammed the\nreversing lever hard over.\n\nIt was too late. The next instant the _Porpoise_, with a shock that made\nher shiver from stem to stern, collided with the steel side of a small\nwarship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIN THE MIDST OF FIRE\n\n\n\"Pull the secondary emergency lever!\" cried the professor through the\nspeaking tube to Washington. \"We must reach the surface at once!\"\n\n\"Are we damaged?\" asked Andy, scrambling to his feet, for the shock had\nknocked him down. The professor had not fallen because he clung to the\nsteering wheel.\n\nThe ship gave a sudden lurch.\n\n\"We're sinking!\" cried Bill, rushing to the conning tower from the\nengine-room.\n\n\"That's only the action of one of the emergency levers,\" said the\nprofessor calmly. \"It forces compressed air into the tanks the more\nquickly to empty them of water. I think we are safe.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mark, as, followed by Jack, he came forward.\n\n\"We tried to do the torpedo act to one of Uncle Sam's ships,\" explained\nAndy.\n\nThe electric lights had been switched on, and, with the _Porpoise_\nflooded with the bright beams, those on board waited anxiously for what\nwas to happen next.\n\nSuddenly an upward motion was experienced. The next instant the craft\nbounced out of the water and fell back in a smother of foam, shaking and\nshivering, alongside a small armored warship that was anchored about two\nmiles and a half from shore.\n\n\"Open the manhole,\" commanded Mr. Henderson.\n\nMark sprang up the iron ladder that led to the opening in the deck of\nthe _Porpoise_ and threw back the cams that held the heavy iron in\nplace. Then he swung the cover back and stepped out on the small\nplatform, followed by the professor, Andy and Jack. They looked up to\nfind themselves observed by a curious throng that crowded to the rail of\nthe warship.\n\n[Illustration: A CURIOUS THRONG CROWDED TO THE RAIL OF THE\nWARSHIP.--_Page 28._]\n\n\"What are you trying to do? Ram me with a new-fangled torpedo?\" asked an\nangry voice, and a man in a gold laced uniform, who, from his importance\nplainly showed himself to be the captain of the ship, shook his fist at\nMr. Henderson.\n\n\"I might ask what right your ship has to get in my path,\" replied the\ninventor. \"It was all an accident.\"\n\n\"Mighty queer,\" muttered the naval commander. \"Looks very suspicious.\nHow do I know but what you're a torpedo from some foreign nation?\"\n\n\"Because this is not a torpedo,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"It is a new\nsubmarine boat of my invention, and I was giving it a trial spin.\"\n\n\"I guess you'd better come aboard and do your explaining,\" went on the\ncaptain. \"I don't like the looks of things. Lower a boat!\" he shouted,\n\"and bring those chaps to my cabin. I want to question them.\"\n\nIt did not suit Professor Henderson to have his plans upset in this\nfashion. Nor did he care to give a detailed description of his ship to\nofficers of the war department. He had many valuable inventions that\nwere not patented. So he determined to outwit the pompous commander of\nthe cruiser.\n\nThe noise made in preparing the small boat for lowering over the side of\nthe big ship could be plainly heard.\n\n\"Go below, all of you, and as quietly as you can,\" whispered Mr.\nHenderson.\n\nAndy, Mark and Jack obeyed. At that instant the side of the warship was\nalmost deserted, for the sailors who had gathered to observe the\n_Porpoise_ had gone to lower the small boat.\n\nNo sooner had Jack, who was in the rear, disappeared through the manhole\nthan the professor, with a quick jump, followed him.\n\n\"Here! Come back!\" shouted the warship's captain as he saw Mr.\nHenderson's head disappearing from view. \"Come back I say!\"\n\nBut with a quick movement the inventor pulled down the manhole cover and\nclamped it. Then he sprang to the conning tower, and, with a jerk,\nopened the levers that admitted water to the tanks. The _Porpoise_ began\nto sink slowly, and then more suddenly, so that, in less than a minute,\nshe was out of sight beneath the waves, and the angry, gold-laced\ncaptain was staring in wonderment at the place where the submarine had\nbeen. The spot was marked only by a few bubbles and some foam.\n\n\"I guess he'll wait some time for an explanation,\" spoke Mr. Henderson,\nas he started the big screw and sent the _Porpoise_ ahead at a swift\npace.\n\n\"That was rather a narrow escape,\" observed Jack, standing at the foot\nof the conning tower stairs and talking to Andy and Mr. Henderson, who\nwas steering.\n\n\"It certainly was,\" agreed the professor. \"I have not yet become used to\nseeing things very far ahead in the dimness caused by being under water.\nBut we'll soon get used to it. Luckily, the _Porpoise_ was not damaged\nby the shock.\"\n\nFor several hours the _Porpoise_ was kept on her course. She behaved\nhandsomely, and nothing excepting slight and easily remedied defects\nwere found. The professor steered well out to sea, increasing both the\nforward speed and the depth to which the vessel sank. Presently the\ncraft came to a stop with a little jolt.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" asked Mark, somewhat alarmed.\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" replied the professor with a smile, as he stepped out\nof the conning tower and entered the engine-room. \"I thought it was time\nfor dinner so I stopped the ship. We are now resting on the ocean bed,\nabout half a mile below the surface. Look!\"\n\nAs he spoke he slid back the slides covering the plate glass windows.\nThe boys saw that the ship rested in the midst of an immense forest of\nsea weed. Some of the stalks were as large around as trees. In and out\namong the snake-like, waving branches swam big fishes. It was a weird,\nbut beautiful sight.\n\n\"Come, Washington, serve dinner,\" ordered Mr. Henderson, and the colored\nman soon had a good meal prepared. Few repasts have been eaten under\nsuch strange circumstances.\n\nDesiring to be back at his secluded dock by nightfall, Captain Henderson\nsoon started the _Porpoise_ up again. Without any accidents the return\ntrip was made and by nine o'clock the _Porpoise_ rode safely at the\ndock where she had been launched.\n\nThe night was spent in the cabin on shore. Early the next morning Mr.\nHenderson paid a visit to the ship, to make a thorough examination by\ndaylight, and see if the craft had suffered any damage.\n\n\"I think you and Mark will have to make a trip to town,\" he said to Jack\nat the breakfast table. \"I need a new monkey wrench and some other tools\nand some small pieces of machinery. I'll give you a list of them, and\nyou can bring them back in a valise, for they will be quite numerous.\"\n\nAfter the meal the inventor made a record of what he needed and the boys\nstarted off.\n\n\"In case the machine shop does not have everything and you have to wait\nfor something, you had better stay in the town all night,\" the captain\nof the _Porpoise_ said. \"It is quite a long trip and I don't want you\ntraveling after dark. Put up at the hotel if you are delayed.\"\n\nProvided with money for their purchase, and a large valise in which to\ncarry them, the boys started off. They had to walk two miles to where a\ntrolley line was built that ran to the town of Easton, where they were\nto get the tools and parts of machinery.\n\nThey made the trip safely and without incident. When they gave the\nmachinist, to whom they had been directed by Mr. Henderson, the list of\nthe things needed, the man looked puzzled.\n\n\"I'll have to make one piece,\" he said. \"You'll have to wait for it.\nCan't promise it before to-morrow morning about eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"That will be all right,\" remarked Mark. \"We'll call for it then.\"\n\nSo, bearing in mind Mr. Henderson's instructions, the boys engaged a\nroom at the hotel, which was quite a large one, for Easton was a\nfavorite summer resort and the town was filled with visitors. The lads\nstrolled about the town, had their dinner, and then went for a bath in\nthe surf. They retired early, for they were tired.\n\nIn the middle of the night Mark began to dream that he was on board the\n_Porpoise_ and that the submarine blew up. There was a loud noise, he\nsaw a bright flash of flame, and saw rolling clouds of smoke. So vivid\nwas the vision that he thought he tried to leap out of the boat, and\nawoke with a jump, to find Jack shaking him.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Mark.\n\n\"The hotel's on fire!\" shouted Jack.\n\nMark sprang out of bed and with Jack rushed to the window, for their\nroom was filled with thick smoke. They could see the dull glare of\nflames, which every moment were becoming brighter.\n\nThe next instant a loud explosion shook the building. It swayed and\nseemed likely to topple over. Outside the boys could hear excited shouts\nand the puffing and whistling of fire engines.\n\n\"Quick! Run!\" yelled Mark. He opened the door leading into the corridor,\nbut was driven back by a rush of flames and smoke that almost stifled\nhim.\n\n\"We must try the fire escape!\" shouted Mark.\n\n\"Don't forget the valise with the tools;\" exclaimed Jack, and Mark\nhastened to where he had placed it under the bed.\n\nThen the two boys rushed to the balcony on which their front windows\nopened, and whence the fire escapes led down to the streets. The lads\nhad only time to slip on their coats, trousers, shoes and caps.\n\nAs they were preparing to clamber down the iron ladders they heard\nsomeone on the balcony next to them shout:\n\n\"Here, you boys! Stop! I want you!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA GRAVE ACCUSATION\n\n\n\"We haven't time now!\" yelled back Mark, looking in the direction of the\nvoice, and seeing a short, stout man, who appeared greatly excited.\n\n\"Stop or I'll shoot!\" the man exclaimed.\n\n\"The fire must have made him crazy,\" said Jack. \"Go on, Mark, it's\ngetting hot up above!\"\n\nMark did not linger on the ladder and soon the two boys were in the\nstreet, surrounded by an excited crowd.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked several.\n\n\"I guess not,\" replied Mark. \"What caused the fire?\"\n\n\"Some sort of an explosion,\" answered a policeman. \"Part of the hotel\nwas blown up. If you boys wish you can go to a station house where\nyou'll be comfortable until morning.\"\n\n\"I guess we will,\" said Mark.\n\nThey started to work their way through the crowd but did not notice that\nthe strange man followed them. The fire was now burning fiercely, and\nonce they had gotten clear of the press the lads halted to look at the\nspectacle.\n\nThe hotel was now a mass of flames and the firemen were kept busy. What\nwith the puffing of engines, the whistling of the steamers, the roar of\nthe flames, and the shouts of the crowd, pandemonium reigned.\n\nThe boys watched the fire for some time. Gradually the flames came under\nthe control of the men and the leaping tongues died out.\n\n\"I guess we'd better go to the police station,\" suggested Jack.\n\nMark agreed this would be a good thing to do, as both of them felt\nrather chilly in the night air with only half of their clothes on. They\ninquired their way of the first policeman they saw, and he volunteered\nto escort them.\n\n\"Sure an' you'll have plenty of company,\" he said. \"The hotel was full\nan' the people have no place to go except to the lock-up. Some swells\nwill be glad to take a place behind the bars to-night I'm thinkin'. I\nwonder how some of those English aristocrats will like it?\"\n\n\"English aristocrats?\" repeated Jack. \"Are any here?\"\n\n\"Sure. There's a lot of them burned out. Lord Peckham was stoppin' at\nthe hotel with a big crowd of people, an' their apartments was all\ndestroyed. Some of 'em went to the police station.\"\n\nThe boys followed their uniformed guide through the streets of Easton,\nand were soon at the station house. There they were received by the\nsergeant in charge, while the matron gave them each a cup of hot coffee,\na large pot of the beverage having been brewed.\n\n\"I'll have to give you boys one bed between you,\" said the sergeant.\n\"We're rather crowded for room to-night.\"\n\n\"Anything will do us,\" said Jack with a laugh.\n\nJust then there was some excitement at the entrance of the police\nstation.\n\n\"I tell you they're in here! I will see them!\" a voice exclaimed. \"I\nwant them arrested at once!\"\n\n\"Go easy now,\" counseled the doorman as he tried to hold back a short,\nstout, excited man who was pushing his way into the station.\n\n\"There they are!\" exclaimed the man, pointing to Jack and Mark.\n\n\"Why those boys are from the burned hotel,\" said the doorman.\n\n\"I know it! They are the very ones I want!\"\n\n\"What do you of us?\" spoke up Mark. He recognized the man as the one who\nhad called to him as he and Jack were escaping.\n\n\"I charge you with being sons of James Darrow, the notorious English\nanarchist!\" cried the little man, pointing his finger at the boys, \"and\nI accuse you of trying to kill Lord Peckham with a bomb, the explosion\nof which set fire to the hotel!\"\n\nFor a moment the surprising charge so astonished every one that not a\nword was said. Then the little man, advancing toward the boys went on:\n\n\"I arrest you in the name of His Royal Highness, Edward VII, King of\nEngland, Scotland and Wales.\"\n\nHe threw back the lapel of his coat and showed a badge.\n\n\"King of England, Scotland and Wales, is it!\" exclaimed the doorman with\na twinkle in his eye. \"An' why didn't ye say Ireland into the bargain.\"\n\n\"Ireland, of course,\" went on the little man. \"I'm an officer of His\nMost Gracious Majesty,\" he added, \"and I demand the assistance of the\nUnited States authorities in general and the police of Easton in\nparticular in taking these desperate criminals into custody!\"\n\n\"Hold your horses,\" advised the desk-sergeant. \"Those boys are not\nliable to run away. They're to stay here over night, and if you have any\ncharge to make against them why you'll have to come and see the judge\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"But they are sons of an anarchist! They are anarchists themselves!\"\nexclaimed the man, \"I must arrest them!\"\n\n\"You're not going to arrest anybody,\" said the sergeant, \"until you get\na warrant from the judge. This isn't England.\"\n\n\"Then I'm going to stay with these boys the rest of the night,\" insisted\nthe man. \"I can't take any chances on their giving me the slip.\"\n\n\"This place is going to be crowded with people from the burned hotel,\"\nobjected the sergeant. \"There will be no room for you. Besides, how do I\nknow these boys are anarchists?\"\n\n\"Look in their valise,\" cried the stranger. \"It is filled with bombs.\"\n\n\"You can't look in this satchel,\" exclaimed Jack, for he remembered the\nvalise contained parts of the professor's secret machines.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" cried the Englishman with triumph in his tones.\n\"They are the guilty ones. They are afraid to open their valise.\"\n\n\"We are, but not because it has bombs in it,\" said Mark. \"It has parts\nof an unpatented machine and the owner does not want any one to see\nthem,\" for Mark remembered Mr. Henderson's strict injunctions to let no\none but the mechanist to whom they had gone catch a glimpse of the\nparts that were to be duplicated. The machinist was sworn to secrecy.\n\n\"It's none of our affair,\" said the sergeant, though he seemed a little\nimpressed by the Englishman's words and the reluctance Mark and Jack\nshowed to letting the valise be opened. \"The boys will be here until\nmorning, and then you can see the judge. Now you'll have to get out. You\nboys get to bed.\"\n\nMuttering threats, the stranger went from the station house, and Mark\nand Jack, in response to a nod from the doorman, followed him upstairs\nto a part of the police station used to detain witnesses. They were\nshown to a small room with a single bed.\n\n\"Are ye really anarchists?\" asked the doorman.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" replied Jack, and he told as much of their story as he\ndared.\n\n\"I was kind-of hopin' ye was,\" said the officer with a twinkle in his\neye. \"It wouldn't do any harm to scare that uppish Englishman a bit.\nSure he an' his kind have done enough to poor old Ireland.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry we can't oblige you,\" said Mark with a laugh.\n\n\"I guess ye're all right,\" went on the doorman. \"I hope ye sleep good\nthe rest of the night.\"\n\nThen he left them alone. What with the excitement of the fire and the\nstartling accusation against them, the boys' brains were too excited to\nlet them sleep much. They had a few fitful naps throughout the remainder\nof the night.\n\nIt was just getting daylight when Mark was awakened by some one shaking\nhim.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked. \"Another fire?\"\n\n\"Not this time,\" replied a voice, and Mark, now that his eyes were fully\nopened, saw the doorman bending over him.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Jack waking up in his turn.\n\n\"Easy!\" exclaimed the doorman in a whisper. \"I happened to think ye\nmight want to be leavin'.\"\n\n\"Leaving?\" asked Mark in bewilderment.\n\n\"Yes. Ye know that Englishman is liable to be back any minute, an' he\nmay make trouble for ye. I know ye're innocent lads, an' I'd hate to see\nye mixed up in a mess with that fellow. So I slips up here early, an' ye\ncan leave by the back door if ye want to, an' the officer of His\nImperial Majesty, King Edward VII, will never know a thing about it.\"\n\n\"It looks like running away,\" objected Jack.\n\n\"Sure there's no charge agin ye,\" went on the doorman. \"Ye're free to\ncome an' go as far as we're concerned, an' ye'd better go whilst ye have\nthe chance.\"\n\nJack reflected. It was true that the charge of the Englishman, baseless\nas it was, might make trouble for them, and cause them endless delays in\ngetting back to Professor Henderson. Suddenly Jack made up his mind.\n\n\"Come on Mark,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nON A RUNAWAY TROLLEY\n\n\n\"Are you going to leave?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Certainly. There is no use staying here and getting mixed up in\nsomething that Englishman thinks we have done. It's easier to go away\nquietly and let him find out his mistake.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Mark. \"I wonder who he is, anyhow?\"\n\n\"He thinks he owns the earth, whoever he is,\" returned Jack.\n\n\"He's some sort of a special detective traveling with Lord Peckham's\nparty,\" explained the doorman. \"He told us a lot about himself last\nnight after you boys went to bed. He came back to inquire how early the\njudge would be here.\n\n\"He went on to tell how some English anarchists have vowed to kill Lord\nPeckham because he foreclosed a lot of mortgages on some poor people in\nIreland where he owned property,\" added the doorman. \"There was some\nsort of explosions in the hotel, near where Lord Peckham had his rooms.\nMaybe it was a bomb and, maybe ag'in it was only the boiler. Anyhow,\nthis detective jumped to the conclusion that anarchists had done it, and\nhe thinks you are responsible. But you'd better be goin' now. It's\ngettin' daylight.\"\n\nSo Mark and Jack, with what scanty clothes they had, and carrying their\nvalise, went quietly out of the back door of the police station.\n\n\"We'd better go to the machine shop for the rest of the stuff,\"\nsuggested Mark, \"and then we can take the first trolley we see and get\nback to the professor.\"\n\nThrough quiet side streets the boys made their way toward the machine\nshop. They were somewhat amused to think how they had fooled the\ndetective, but they would not have felt so jolly had they seen the\nroughly dressed man who had darted after them as soon as they left the\npolice station.\n\n\"I'll get you yet,\" the man muttered. \"You needn't think to escape with\nthe aid of these bloomin' American police.\"\n\nThe lads found the machinist just opening his shop though it was quite\nearly. The pieces of apparatus were finished and, after paying for them\nMark put the parts in the valise.\n\n\"Quite a fire in town,\" observed the machinist.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mark, not wishing to get into a long conversation.\n\n\"Heard the hotel was blowed up by anarchists and that the police are\nafter 'em,\" proceeded the man.\n\n\"I believe I did hear something like that,\" admitted Mark. \"I guess\nwe'll be going.\"\n\nHe signalled to Jack, and the two hurried out of the shop. As they did\nso, the trampish-looking man glided from behind a tree where he had been\nhiding and took after them.\n\n\"Say,\" exclaimed Jack, \"I forgot we haven't had any breakfast yet.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Mark, rubbing his stomach and making a wry face.\n\nNear by was a bakery, and there the lads got some coffee and rolls which\ntasted fine. When they finished their simple meal a trolley came past\nand they ran to catch it. So did the man who had been following them,\nbut this person bore no resemblance to the spruce little detective who\nhad wanted to arrest the boys.\n\n\"A couple of hours now and we'll be back at the cabin,\" spoke Mark. \"My,\nbut I must say we have had strenuous times since we started away!\"\n\nThere were few passengers on the trolley so early in the morning and not\nmany stops to make, so the motorman turned on the power full and made\nthe vehicle speed along.\n\nMile after mile was covered and finally the car reached the top of a\nlong hill. At the foot of this the line came to an end, and the boys had\na two mile tramp before them to reach the lonely spot where the\n_Porpoise_ was docked.\n\nDown the hill the car started. The motorman shut off the electricity and\nlet the vehicle run by its weight.\n\nFaster and faster it ran, the dust flying in a cloud about it.\n\n\"Better put the brakes on a bit,\" called the conductor. \"It's gettin'\nkinder speedy, Hank!\"\n\nThe motorman twisted the handle. There was a grinding noise as the shoes\ntook hold on the wheels. Then a chain snapped and the car seemed to leap\nahead.\n\n\"The brake's busted! I can't stop the car!\" yelled the motorman.\n\nVainly he twisted at the handle. Then, seeing he could not stop the\ntrolley car he made a desperate jump off the vehicle and landed in a\nheap on the side of the road, rolling over and over.\n\n\"Reverse the current!\" cried one of the passengers, to the conductor.\n\"That ought to stop her!\"\n\nThe conductor made his way to the front platform and turned the\nreversing lever. Then he applied the current. But it was no use. With a\nblinding flash and a report like that of a gun a fuse blew out, and that\ncrippled the car completely so far as the electric current was\nconcerned.\n\n\"Everybody jump!\" cried the conductor. \"There's a curve at the foot of\nthe hill, and we'll all be killed if we stay on!\"\n\nOne by one the passengers leaped from the car. Several were badly hurt\nby the falls they got. Meanwhile the trolley was tearing down the hill\nat a terrific rate of speed.\n\n\"Shall we jump?\" asked Mark of Jack.\n\n\"We'll be killed if we do,\" was Jack's answer.\n\n\"And we'll be killed if we stay aboard,\" said Mark.\n\n\"Not if I can help it,\" cried Jack as he started for the rear platform.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Put on the other brake. They never thought to try this one! Maybe it\nwill work and stop the car!\"\n\nThen Mark saw what Jack was up to and went to help him. The shabbily\ndressed man seemed undecided what to do. He stood up, holding to the\nstraps to prevent himself from being tossed from side to side as the\nrunaway trolley swayed. He watched the boys curiously.\n\nThe lads, reaching the rear platform, twisted at the brake handle with\nall their strength. They could feel that the chain was still intact. But\nwould the shoes grip the wheels with force sufficient to stop the car?\n\nThere was a shrill screech as the brakes were applied by the boys. With\nall their might they turned the handle, winding the chain up tighter and\ntighter. At last they could not budge it another inch. Then they waited\nanxiously.\n\nThe car never slackened its speed. So great was the momentum that had\nboth sets of brakes been in working order it is doubtful whether they\nwould have stopped the vehicle. The speed was so great now that one of\nthe journals became hot and the oily waste that was packed in it caught\nfire, making what railroad men term a \"hot box\".\n\n\"I guess we're done for,\" groaned Mark.\n\n\"We certainly haven't checked the speed any,\" Jack admitted. \"But wait a\nminute.\"\n\nHe began stamping on the floor of the platform.\n\n\"What you doing?\" cried Mark, for he had to shout to make his voice\nheard above the roar and rattle of the car.\n\n\"Putting on the sand,\" replied Jack, as he kicked at the plunger which,\nbeing depressed, let a stream of fine gravel out on the rails. \"The\nwheels are gripped I think, and are slipping on the rails. This may help\nsome.\"\n\n\"Let me give you a hand,\" exclaimed a voice, and the boys turned to see\nthe shabby man standing with them on the platform. He grasped the brake\nhandle, and gave it an additional turn. His strength seemed remarkable\nfor so small a man.\n\nThe speed of the car was checked a little, but the vehicle was still\nspeeding along at a rate that would soon bring it to destruction if not\nhalted before the curve was reached.\n\n\"That's a little better,\" observed Mark. \"It's a good thing you were\nhere.\"\n\n\"Good for me, not so good for you,\" said the man with a peculiar smile.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I mean that I shall have to place you under arrest for attempting to\nassassinate Lord Peckham!\" exclaimed the man. \"I am Detective Ducket, of\nScotland Yard!\"\n\nHe stripped off a false beard he had donned, and threw back his coat,\ndisplaying his shield. He was the same man who had attempted to arrest\nthe boys in the police station at Easton.\n\n\"I've got you just where I want you now,\" Detective Ducket went on.\n\"There are none of those blooming American police to interfere.\"\n\nThe next instant the car gave a sudden lurch. Then it seemed to rise up\nin the air. Jack felt himself flying through space, and he observed\nMark, who was clinging to the valise, following him.\n\nThere was a terrific crash, a ripping, tearing splintering sound, and\nthe runaway trolley smashed into a big oak tree at the foot of the hill.\nThe vehicle had completely jumped the track at the sharp curve.\n\nJack's eyes grew dim, and he seemed to be sinking down in some dark pool\nof water. He heard a splashing beside him and began to strike out,\ntrying to swim. He seemed to be choking. Then the blessed air and\ndaylight came to him, and he found he was floating on the surface of a\npond.\n\nHe dashed the water from his eyes and saw, over on the bank, the wreck\nof the trolley. Then he noticed that Mark was swimming beside him.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"A little of everything,\" panted Mark. \"Lucky we weren't killed. We must\nhave been flung off the rear platform into this duck pond.\"\n\nThe boys soon made their way to shore, unhurt except for the wetting.\nThe fall into the water had saved their lives.\n\n\"Where's the valise of machinery?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"There it is,\" answered Mark pointing to where it had fallen at the back\nof the pond.\n\n\"And what became of Detective Ducket?\"\n\n\"He's here, at your service!\" exclaimed a voice. \"Consider yourselves\nunder arrest and don't you dare to leave this place without me.\"\n\nThe boys looked in the direction of the sound and saw the English\nofficer lying on the grass not far away. He seemed in pain, but had\nraised himself on his elbow and was pointing his finger sternly at the\nboys.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOFF FOR THE SOUTH POLE\n\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I think my leg is broken, but otherwise I'm not damaged,\" replied the\ndetective. \"Even if I am disabled, it makes no difference, you are my\nprisoners. I command you to stay here until help comes.\"\n\nThe boys did not know what to do. They did not like to see even an enemy\nsuffer, but, at the same time, they knew he had no right to arrest them.\n\n\"Here comes a wagon,\" said Mark, catching the sound of wheels.\n\n\"Well, fo' de land sakes! Gollyation! What terrible catafterme hab\noccurred in dis unapproachable manner?\" a voice demanded.\n\n\"It's Washington!\" cried Mark, as he saw Professor Henderson's colored\nassistant driving along the road.\n\n\"Dat's who it am!\" exclaimed Washington as he noticed the boys. \"My! My!\nBut am you boff dead?\"\n\n\"No, only one of us,\" said Mark with a laugh, as he and Jack ran toward\nthe wagon.\n\n\"Ha! Ha! Dat's one ob yo' jokes,\" said Washington. \"But hurry up, boys.\nDe perfessor he done sent me to meet you. He reckoned you'd becomin'\nober on an early trolley. He's in a hurry to git away.\"\n\n\"Don't you boys dare to leave!\" exclaimed Detective Ducket.\n\n\"Who's dat?\" asked Washington.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Mark. \"He was hurt in the trolley smash, but not\nbadly. We'll send help, from the first farm house we come to. Come on,\nWashington, we'll go with you.\"\n\nThe boys jumped into the wagon, and Washington started off. He explained\nthat the inventor was anxious to make a start that day, as there would\nbe an unusually high tide which would be followed a little later by a\nlow one, and that would make it difficult to cross the harbor bar.\n\n\"So I hired dis wagon an' come after you,\" said the colored man.\n\nAt the first house they came to the boys stopped and told about the\naccident. The farmer agreed to go and get the detective and the others\nwho were hurt and take them to a hospital.\n\n\"I guess we're rid of that detective now,\" observed Jack, as they\nstarted off again.\n\n\"Yes, but we're getting away under a cloud on our characters,\" said\nMark. \"I'd like to stay and see the thing through, if we had time.\"\n\n\"But we can't, and there's no use worrying over it,\" spoke Jack.\n\nIn a short time they were at the inventor's cabin, and related to Mr.\nHenderson all that had occurred.\n\n\"Well I guess your detective friend will have a hard time to find you in\na few hours,\" said the old man. \"We start on our trip for the south pole\nthis evening.\"\n\nThere were busy times for the next few hours. Many supplies had to be\nplaced on board, and, while the boys, with Tom and Bill, saw to this, the\nprofessor and Washington were occupied with putting the last touches to\nthe submarine boat's machinery.\n\nMost of the supplies from the cabin were placed in the _Porpoise_,\nincluding food and clothing and a good quantity of minerals that, with\nsea water, generated the gas that made steam.\n\nAn early supper was made on shore, as the professor said they might be\nso busy for the first few hours of the starting trip that they would get\nno chance to eat. Then the cabin and buildings where the submarine had\nbeen built, were securely fastened.\n\n\"I guess we're all ready,\" announced the professor, taking a last look\naround.\n\nOne by one they went aboard the _Porpoise_ crawling down through the man\nhole. The inventor was the last one to enter. He clamped the cover on by\nmeans of the cam levers and switched on the electric lights. Then he\ntook his place in the conning tower with Andy Sudds.\n\n\"Forward, to the South Pole!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson.\n\nWith a turn of his wrist the inventor started the engines. The big screw\nin the shaft revolved, pulling the water in at one end of the craft and\nsending it out in a swirling stream at the other. The trip was fairly\nbegun.\n\nFor several miles the _Porpoise_ glided along on the surface of the\nocean. It was a calm evening, and the boys down in the cabin of the\ncraft could look into the reflecting mirrors on the wall, which were\nconnected with observation magnifying glasses in the conning tower, and\nview what was going on, though their heads were below the surface of the\nsea.\n\nAs it grew darker the view of shore and water faded away. The engine\nkept up its speed with Washington to see to it every now and then,\noiling the bearings, some of which did not run quite smoothly because of\ntheir newness.\n\n\"I'll send her down a bit now,\" observed the professor. \"I don't want to\nrun into any more warships or scare the crews by making them think we\nare a foreign torpedo boat.\"\n\nHe opened the sea cocks in the ballast tanks and soon the _Porpoise_\nsunk about two hundred feet beneath the waves. The craft, which had been\npitching and tossing under the influence of a ground swell, became more\nsteady and quiet once it left the surface.\n\nThe searchlight in the conning tower was turned on, and in the glare of\nit Andy and the professor were able to steer properly, aided by the\ncompass which gave them the true southern course.\n\nIt was now quite dark. Additional electric lights were switched on in\nthe cabin, engine and dining room. Andy came out of the conning tower\nand announced that Captain Henderson wanted Washington to get supper.\n\nAll the cooking was done by electricity, and, in addition to a supply of\nthe usual and ordinary kinds of food, there was a big lot of patent\ncondensed victuals to draw on. Soup, broiled steak, potatoes, hot\nbiscuits, rice pudding and coffee made up the repast which was enjoyed\nby all.\n\nToward the close of the meal Professor Henderson began to sniff the air\nof the cabin.\n\n\"What's the matter? Do you smell a storm brewing?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"No, but the air is not as fresh as it should be,\" replied the inventor.\n\"Washington, release a little more of the supply from the compression\ntanks.\"\n\nThe ship, which had been left to steer itself automatically while the\nprofessor was absent from the conning tower, was moving along at about\nhalf speed. The gage showed they were going at twenty miles an hour, and\nwere three hundred feet below the surface.\n\n\"Washington and I will share the first night's watch between us,\" said\nthe inventor, after the supper things had been cleared away. \"There will\nnot be much to do, as the ship will steer automatically in whatever\ndirection I set her. Still I want to see how she behaves. The rest of\nyou might as well go to your bunks.\"\n\nThe two boys were especially glad of a chance to go to bed, as they had\nhad but little sleep the night before on account of the fire. So they\nlost no time in undressing and rolling up in the blankets, for it was\nquite cool so far down under the water.\n\n\"Well, we've slept on the earth, above the earth and now we're under the\nwaters,\" observed Jack.\n\n\"There's only one place more to spend your time taking a snooze,\" said\nMark.\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"Inside the earth.\"\n\nThen they fell asleep. During the night and the next day the _Porpoise_\nforged on underneath the waves. Washington relieved Mr. Henderson in the\nconning tower and reported the machinery to be working well.\n\n\"Keep her headed due south,\" was the order of the inventor, and the\ncolored man did so.\n\nIt was about four o'clock one morning that Washington felt a slight jar\nto the submarine.\n\n\"Hope we ain't goin' to hit no more battleships,\" he said.\n\nHe glanced at the speed-indicating gage. To his surprise it stood at\nzero. The craft was not moving forward a foot! Yet the engines were\ngoing at half speed!\n\nIn great alarm Washington shut off the power and ran to acquaint\nProfessor Henderson with the news.\n\n\"Suffin's ketched us!\" cried the colored man.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said the inventor, yet he seemed alarmed as he slipped on\nhis clothes and hastened to the conning tower.\n\nHe peered ahead along the path of water illuminated by the glare of the\nsearchlight, but nothing was to be seen. Then he started the engine,\nincreasing the speed gradually until the big screw in the shaft revolved\nmore than one thousand times a minute. Still the _Porpoise_ never\nstirred. She remained in the same position, as if some giant hand\ngrasped her.\n\n\"Reverse the engine,\" said the professor.\n\nWashington did so. To the surprise of both of them the ship shot\nbackward like a frightened crab.\n\n\"Now forward!\" exclaimed the old inventor.\n\nBut this time the _Porpoise_ did not move. It was as if she was up\nagainst a stone wall.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Mark, who had been awakened by the excitement\non board.\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Mr. Henderson gravely. \"Something mysterious\nhas occurred. We can go no further!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nASHORE IN THE DARK\n\n\n\"Stop the engine,\" the captain commanded after he had peered through the\nlens in the conning tower for some time. \"We must see what is the\nmatter.\"\n\nHe glanced at the depth gage and noted that they were now four hundred\nfeet below the surface. Then he consulted some charts.\n\n\"There is a depth of one thousand feet about here,\" he remarked. \"Lower\nthe ship, Washington. Let us see if by getting on the ocean bed we can\nget away from this obstruction.\"\n\nThe colored man opened wider the sea cocks by which the tanks were\nfilled. The increased ballast sunk the _Porpoise_ still lower, and, in a\nfew minutes a slight jar told the navigators that they were on the\nbottom of the ocean.\n\n\"Now we will see if we have cleared the obstruction,\" said the\nprofessor.\n\nHe started the big screw to revolving, but the ship did not move. It\nshivered and trembled throughout its length but remained stationary.\n\n\"Maybe dar's a debil fish what hab circumulated dis ship in de exteror\nportion ob his anatomy,\" suggested Washington, rolling his eyes until\nonly the whites were visible.\n\n\"I presume you mean that a giant squid or cuttle fish has attacked us,\"\nspoke the professor.\n\n\"Yas, sir,\" replied Washington.\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" went on the inventor. \"However, we must make an\ninvestigation.\"\n\n\"How are you going to do it?\" asked Mark. \"You can't see the end of the\ntube from inside the ship, and, even if we went to the surface it would\nstill be under water.\"\n\n\"We are going to look at it while here, under the ocean,\" said the\ninventor.\n\n\"Well, maybe you're a good swimmer,\" put in Jack, \"but I don't believe\nyou can stay under, in this depth of water, long enough to see what the\ntrouble is.\"\n\n\"I think I can,\" answered Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I'll show you. Washington, bring out the diving suits.\"\n\nThe colored man, his eyes growing bigger every minute, went to a locker\nand brought out what seemed quite a complicated bit of apparatus.\n\n\"With the aid of these,\" said the professor, \"I will be able to go out,\nwalk along the ocean bed, and investigate the mystery. Do you boys want\nto come along?\"\n\n\"Is it safe?\" asked Mark, who was inclined to be cautious.\n\n\"As safe as any part of this under-sea voyage,\" replied the professor.\n\"These diving suits are something I have not told you about,\" he went\non. \"They are my own invention. Besides the regular rubber suits there\nis an interlining of steel,--something like the ancient suits of chain\nmail--to withstand the great pressure of water. Then, instead of being\ndependent on a supply of air, pumped into the helmet from an apparatus\nin a boat on the surface, each person carries his own air supply with\nhim.\"\n\n\"How is that?\" asked Jack, and Mark also asked the question.\n\n\"Simply by attaching a little tank of the compressed gas to the shoulder\npiece of the suit,\" said the inventor. \"There is enough air in the tank\nto last for nearly a day. It is admitted to the helmet as needed by\nmeans of automatic valves. In other respects the diving suit is the same\nas the ordinary kind, except that there is a small searchlight, fed by a\nstorage battery, on top of the helmet.\"\n\nIn spite of their fears at venturing out under the great ocean, the two\nboys were anxious to try the suits. So, after some hesitation, they\ndonned them.\n\n\"Here, take these with you,\" said the professor, before their helmets\nwere screwed on. He held out what looked like long sticks.\n\n\"What are they?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Electric guns,\" replied the professor. \"But come on now, we have no\ntime to lose.\"\n\nFurther conversation was impossible, for the boys had their heavy copper\nhelmets on, and they were as tightly enclosed as if inside a box. They\ngrasped their weapons and waited for the next move.\n\nThe professor led the way to the stern of the ship. The boys found it\nhard to walk, as they were weighted down by the heavy suits, and also\nthe boots, the soles of which were of lead.\n\nThey followed the inventor into what seemed a small room. Inside they\nfound themselves in darkness. There was a clanking sound as Washington\nfastened and clamped the door shut. Then came a hissing.\n\nThe boys felt water rising about them. They could experience its\ncoldness, even through the diving suits. They were much afraid, but the\nprofessor put a reassuring hand on their shoulders.\n\nThey seemed to feel a great weight. It gradually lessened, however, and,\nin a few minutes, they saw something move in front of them. The\nprofessor pushed them gently forward.\n\nIn another instant they were walking on the bed of the ocean, having\nstepped from the _Porpoise_. They had gone into a locked compartment,\nthe inner door of which had been tightly closed, after which water from\noutside had been gradually admitted until the pressure was equal, and\nthen the boys and the professor had merely to emerge out into the bottom\nof the sea when the outer portal was swung aside by Washington, who\nworked the lever from inside.\n\nThe boys were in intense darkness, but, suddenly a light glowed about\nthem, and they saw that the professor had switched on his miniature\nsearch lamp. They remembered how he had told them to work the apparatus,\nand soon tiny gleams shot out from their helmets.\n\nThe professor pointed ahead, for not a sound could be heard, and the\nboys followed him.\n\nIt was a new sensation, this walking along the bed of the ocean. At\nfirst the great pressure of water, even though the steel lined diving\nsuits kept most of it off, was unpleasant. Gradually, however, the boys\nbecame used to it. They had to move slowly, for the water was denser\nthan the air and impeded their progress.\n\nIn a few minutes they reached the forward end of the _Porpoise_. Now\nthey were to solve the mystery of what had stopped the submarine. For a\nfew moments they could distinguish nothing.\n\nSuddenly the boys felt the professor grasping their arms. They looked in\nthe direction he pointed. There in the diffused glare from the search\nlight and the illumination of their helmet lamps they saw, wrapped about\nthe forward shaft opening a gigantic squid or devil fish. Its soft,\njelly-like body completely covered the opening of the shaft preventing\nany water from entering, and thus stopping any forward motion to the\nship.\n\nThis was what had caused all the trouble. The _Porpoise_ had run into\nthe monster, who feeling what it must have thought an enemy, had grasped\nthe submarine with its long sinuous arms.\n\nThe professor hesitated a moment. Then he slowly raised his electrical\ngun, and took aim at the hideous mass. The boys followed his example. At\nMr. Henderson's signal they all fired together.\n\nFrom the muzzles of the guns darted small barbs that carried with them a\nstrong shock of electricity, from storage batteries in the shoulder\npieces of the weapons. Three of them were enough to produce death in an\nanimal as large as a whale.\n\nThe devil fish quivered. Then the water about it suddenly grew black,\nand the boys and the professor were in dense darkness, for the squid had\ndyed the ocean with a dark liquid from the sack it carried for the\npurpose.\n\nThe explorers groped their way to the left, having fortunately grasped\nhands after firing their guns, to prevent being separated in case the\nterrible fish began a death struggle.\n\nLuckily Professor Henderson went in the right direction and managed to\nlocate the _Porpoise_. Then, feeling along her steel sides, he led the\nboys through the inky blackness to the water chamber by which entrance\ncould be had to the interior.\n\nIn a few minutes all three were safely inside and had removed their\ndiving suits. The others crowded about, anxious to learn what had\nhappened. The inventor related it briefly.\n\nOnce more the engines were started. This time there was no hanging back\non the part of the _Porpoise_. The big screw revolved, the water came in\nthe shaft and was thrust out of the rear end, making a current that sent\nthe craft ahead swiftly. The gigantic fish had been killed, and its body\nno longer obstructed progress.\n\n\"Now we'll rise to the surface and see how it feels to sail along that\nway for a while,\" said the professor as he started the pumps that\nemptied the tanks. In a little while the ship was floating on the\nwaves.\n\nIt was now night, and the clouds overhead made it so dark that it was\nhard to see ten feet in advance. The professor did not want to use the\nsearchlight for he did not care to have his presence discovered by\ncurious persons. So he ran the ship at half speed.\n\n\"Where are we now?\" asked Mark, who had entered the conning tower, where\nthe professor was steering.\n\n\"Somewhere's off the coast of South Carolina,\" replied the inventor.\n\nThe next instant there was a sudden shock and jar. The ship quivered\nfrom stem to stern, and came to an abrupt stop.\n\n\"We've hit something!\" exclaimed the professor, shutting down the\nengines with a jerk of the lever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nA PRICE ON THEIR HEADS\n\n\nOn board the _Porpoise_ there was great excitement. Washington, with\nAndy, Tom, Bill and Jack came running from the engine room.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried Jack.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered the professor as calmly as he could. \"We'll\nsoon see, however.\"\n\nHe switched on the searchlight and peered from the conning tower.\n\n\"Can you see anything?\" asked Andy, anxiously.\n\n\"I can,\" announced the inventor.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Land,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"We've hit the coast.\"\n\n\"I hope we ain't done no damage,\" put in Washington.\n\n\"Do you mean to the coast or to us?\" asked the professor, with a smile.\n\"I guess there isn't much danger in ramming the shore excepting to the\n_Porpoise_. However, we do not seem to be in any immediate trouble.\"\n\nHe tested various wheels and levers, and announced that, aside from the\njar, which might have started some of the machinery, the _Porpoise_ was\nunharmed.\n\nThe cover of the man-hole was loosened and, one after another, the\nadventurers crawled out on the small deck or platform. It took them a\nlittle while to become accustomed to the darkness, but soon they were\nable to make out that they had run on the muddy bank of the ocean beach.\nThe tide was low and the _Porpoise_ had rammed her nose well into the\nsoft muck, which accounted for the lack of damage.\n\n\"Well, I guess there is nothing to do excepting to wait for morning,\"\nsaid Mr. Henderson. \"It doesn't look like a very lively neighborhood\nabout here. I don't believe we'll be disturbed.\"\n\nSave for the splash and lapping of the waves and the sound of the wind,\nit was as quiet as the proverbial graveyard. Not a light showed on\nshore, and the gleam from the search lamp of the _Porpoise_ cut the\ndarkness like a small moonbeam.\n\n\"If there's nothing to do I'm going to turn in,\" said Andy. \"I'm tired.\"\n\nThe professor said this was a good suggestion, and, leaving instructions\nthat Washington and Bill were to divide the night's watch between them,\nthe inventor sought his bunk.\n\nThe boys remained on deck a few minutes longer.\n\n\"We certainly are getting our share of adventures,\" remarked Jack.\n\n\"I should say so,\" answered Mark.\n\n\"Gollyation yes!\" exclaimed Washington. \"You-uns done most been eat by\ndat air koslostrous specimen ob a parralleledon! I'm glad I didn't go.\nBut I'se brave enough!\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Mark suddenly, pointing to an object floating on\nthe water.\n\nWashington turned to behold something white drifting along.\n\n\"Oh my good land ob mercy! It's a ghost!\" the colored man yelled. \"It's\na ghost! Land a' massy! Hide me some where, quick!\"\n\nWashington fell on his knees and stretched up his clasped hands in\nsupplication. The boys gazed curiously at the white object that was\nslowly floating toward the stranded ship.\n\nIt rose and fell on the waves, with an odd motion.\n\n\"I wonder what it is,\" said Mark.\n\n\"We'll soon see,\" spoke Jack. \"It's coming this way.\"\n\n\"Don't go near it! Don't touch it, boys!\" pleaded Washington. \"It'll put\nde evil eye on yo', suah! Turn yo' haids away!\"\n\nBut the boys were not so easily frightened. The white thing did look\nqueer, but Jack reasoned correctly that the darkness of the night\nmagnified it, and made it appear stranger than it probably was.\n\n\"I'm going to try to get it,\" said Mark.\n\nThe white thing was now quite close. It resembled a bundle of rags,\nfloating on top of the water, and, as it came nearer, it seemed to take\non a curious form.\n\n\"It's a baby! It's de ghost ob a little dead baby!\" cried the colored\nman. \"Let it alone, I tell you!\"\n\nIndeed, now that Washington had suggested it, the boys could see a\nresemblance to a child in the white object. But this did not deter them.\nJack secured a boat hook from where it was fastened to the platform.\nWith it he gently poked at the white thing. The object seemed to\ncollapse and Jack was conscious of a strange feeling. Then, with slow\nmotions, he drew it close to the side of the ship.\n\nLying on his face he was able to get a good look at the thing. He\nmuttered an exclamation.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried Mark.\n\n\"Nothing but a newspaper!\" announced Jack with a laugh, as he threw it\non the deck. \"All our trouble for nothing.\"\n\n\"I shore thought it were a ghost,\" cried Washington as he got up from\nhis knees.\n\nThe boys went to their bunks. They were the first ones awake the next\nmorning, and Jack followed Mark on deck.\n\n\"There's the paper you rescued from drowning,\" said Mark.\n\n\"So it is,\" came from Jack. \"I wonder if there's any news in it.\"\n\nThe sheet had dried out and Jack spread it open. No sooner had he\nscanned the first page than he uttered a whistle.\n\n\"Something startling?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Startling! I guess yes! Look here!\"\n\nMark looked over Jack's shoulder. Staring at them, from amid a mass of\nother news was the announcement in big black type:\n\n          REWARD FOR BOY ANARCHISTS!\n\nThen followed an account of the burning of the hotel at Easton, a vivid\ndescription with pictures, of how it had been blown up in an attempt to\nassassinate Lord Peckham, and how the two boys, sons of an English\nanarchist, had escaped.\n\nThe rest of the story was given over to a description which Jack and\nMark could see was meant for them though it was incorrect in several\nparticulars. How the boys had escaped the detective, through the trolley\ncar mishap, was related, and then came the startling announcement that\nthe hotel authorities had offered a reward of $1,000 for the capture of\neither or both of the boy anarchists. To this Lord Peckham had added an\nequal sum.\n\n\"Well, it looks as if we were of some importance in the world,\" remarked\nJack.\n\n\"Rather,\" agreed Mark. \"Think of having a price on our heads! Well, that\ndetective certainly is a hustler. When is that paper dated?\"\n\nJack looked and saw that the sheet had been issued in Charleston the day\nprevious. It had probably been thrown overboard from some steamer, and\nhad drifted toward shore.\n\nWhile the boys were speculating over the matter Professor Henderson came\non deck. He saw something was up, and soon had the whole story from the\nboys.\n\n\"I shouldn't worry about it,\" said the inventor. \"They've got to catch\nyou first, and it isn't like running away when you know you are guilty.\nYou boys had no more to do with the fire than the man in the moon. And\nwe'll soon be beyond the reach of rewards and newspapers.\"\n\nNevertheless, the boys brooded over the matter. It seemed that they\nwere still under a cloud, and they wished very much that it could be\ncleared away.\n\nHowever there were soon busy times. The rising tide floated the boat,\nand soon it was riding safely at anchor. The professor needed some small\nbits of machinery, and had decided to send the boys to the nearest town\nfor them. But the news in the paper changed his plans, and he sent Bill\nand Washington, who soon returned with the needed articles.\n\n\"Now we'll make another start,\" said Mr. Henderson, as soon as all were\non board once more. \"This time I hope we will keep on until we reach the\nsouth pole!\"\n\nHe started the engine, the _Porpoise_ sank beneath the waves, and with a\nhum of the big screw that throbbed and vibrated, was away again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nATTACKED BY A MONSTER\n\n\nFor several days the _Porpoise_ plowed her way beneath the surface of\nthe ocean. Obedient to the directing hand of Professor Henderson she\nrose or sank as the tanks were emptied or filled. He put the craft\nthrough several rather difficult movements to test her under all\nconditions. In each one she was a success.\n\nDinner was sometimes eaten five hundred feet below the surface. Then\nwhile Washington washed the dishes and cleaned up the galley, Jack and\nMark looked from the side windows at the strange life under water.\n\nThey were getting farther south now and the water was warmer as the\nequator was approached. This produced a great variety of animal life,\nand the ocean fairly swarmed with fishes, big and little, strange and\ncurious that could be seen from the glass bull's-eyes.\n\nGreat sharks swam up alongside of the _Porpoise_, keeping pace with her\nin spite of her speed. Their cruel tigerish eyes and ugly mouths made\nthe boys shudder as they looked at the creatures. Then came odd\ncreatures that seemed neither of the land or sea, but which swam along\nwith their horrible bodies flapping up against the glass. One and all,\nthe inhabitants of the ocean seemed to resent the intrusion of the\nsubmarine.\n\nOne day the boys turned the light out in the cabin and sat in the\ndarkness the better to observe the fishes. The sea, in the vicinity of\nthe ship, was illuminated with a sort of glow that diffused from the\nsearchlight.\n\nSuddenly, as the boys were watching, there came a thud on the glass\nwindow at the port side. They glanced in that direction to see some\nhorrible thing peering in at them through the window.\n\nAt first they were greatly frightened. Two big eyes of green, with rims\nof what looked like red fire, stared at them, and, there was an ugly\nmouth lined with three rows of teeth.\n\n\"It's only a fish,\" said Mark.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't like to meet it outside,\" said Jack. \"I'd rather be\nhere. My, but it's a nasty sight!\"\n\n\"Let's give Washington a little scare,\" suggested Mark.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"We'll go out and tell him some one in the cabin wants to see him. The\nfish will stay there. See, it is fastened to the glass by some sort of\nsuction arrangement, like the octupus fish have on their arms. Then\nwe'll look in and see what Wash does.\"\n\nJack agreed to the plan. The boys left the cabin, and Mark called to the\ncolored man, who was in the engine room.\n\n\"I'll go right instanter this minute,\" said Washington. \"Don't no grass\ngrow under dis chile's feet!\"\n\n\"Now listen,\" said Mark as he and Jack tiptoed after the colored man.\n\nWashington had no sooner entered the darkened cabin, and caught sight of\nthe horrible staring red and green eyes looking straight at him, than he\nlet out a yell that could be heard all over the ship. Then the colored\nman dropped on his knees and began to implore:\n\n\"Good please Mr. Satan fish, doan take Washington White,\" he begged.\n\"It's all a mistake. I didn't do nuffin. Good please Mr. Satan fish,\ntake some one else. It's disproportionate to de circumulation ob de\ninteriorness ob dis subicecream ship, so kindly pass me by dis time!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Amos Henderson, as he came hurrying into the\ncabin, seeking the cause for Washington's loud cry.\n\nJack and Mark, who came in at that juncture, were a little bit ashamed\nof the trick they had played.\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" repeated Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"We's all goin' to be devoured alibe!\" cried Washington pointing to the\nfish, that still clung to the glass.\n\n\"Ah, a sucker fish!\" remarked the inventor. \"A large specimen, too.\nDon't be afraid Washington, it can't hurt you.\"\n\n\"He looks like he could,\" said the colored man. \"Look at dem teef!\"\n\nIndeed the creature's mouth was a horrible sight, as it opened and shut.\n\n\"I'll show you how to get rid of him,\" said the professor.\n\nHe turned on the electric lights in the cabin, flooding the room with a\nbright glow. The big fish darted off, and, when the lights were turned\nout again, the terrible eyes did not reappear, much to their\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"The lights scared it away,\" remarked the inventor. \"But you mustn't get\nfrightened so easily, Washington. You'll see stranger sights than that\nbefore you're through with this voyage.\"\n\n\"Oh I wasn't 'fraid,\" spoke up Washington. \"I were jest 'stonished,\ndat's all.\"\n\n\"What did you get down on your knees for?\" asked Mark with a grin.\n\n\"I might hab been lookin' for my collar button, for all you knows,\"\nreplied Washington, with an air of great dignity, and went back to the\nengine room.\n\nFor several days after this the _Porpoise_ continued on her way south.\nNow and then appearing on the surface to renew the supply of fresh air,\nand again skimming along under the surface, or deep down, the strange\ncraft kept on. It grew much warmer, and even when some distance below\nthe surface the heat could be felt in an uncomfortable manner.\n\n\"We're getting near the equator,\" explained the professor.\n\nOne afternoon, when dinner had just been finished, and the ship, under\nthe direction of Washington, was gliding along well under the sea, there\ncame a sudden shock.\n\n\"We've hit something!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson as he jumped for the\nconning tower. The shock was repeated.\n\n\"What was it?\" asked someone.\n\n\"Shut down the engine!\" yelled the inventor to the colored man. \"What do\nyou want to go on ramming an object after you've once hit it? Slow down\nthe engine!\"\n\n\"Power's shut off!\" cried Washington. \"We didn't hit nothin'! Something\nhit us!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Somethin's rammin' us,\" went on Washington.\n\n\"It must be a big monster. I was sterrin' along an' there was nothin' in\nde road, when all of a suddint, ker-plunk! We's hit. Look ahead, an' you\ncan't see nothin'!\"\n\nThe professor, and the boys, who had followed him, gazed out of the\nconning tower window. There was nothing forward but a vast expanse of\nwater.\n\nThe next instant the ship careened as something struck her a violent\nblow on the port side. Everyone almost toppled over from the force of\nthe impact.\n\n\"Dar he goes agin!\" cried Washington.\n\n\"We're attacked by a whale!\" said the professor. \"We must rise to the\nsurface or it may damage the ship.\"\n\n\"If it's a whale I'd like to get a shot at it,\" put in Andy Sudds, from\nthe foot of the companion ladder leading into the tower.\n\n\"I don't know that it is a whale,\" went on the inventor. \"But it must be\nsomething very big and strong.\"\n\n\"It's a monster of some sort,\" put in Andy, \"and I want a chance at\nhim.\"\n\n\"It's too risky,\" murmured the professor. \"We couldn't get down to\nbottom here, as the water is several miles deep, and the pressure would\ncrush the _Porpoise_, strong as she is.\"\n\nOnce more came a terrible blow and the ship rocked in a swirl of foam\nbeneath the waves. In quick succession two more fierce onslaughts were\nmade by the unseen monster.\n\n\"We'll have to do something,\" muttered Andy.\n\n\"You're right,\" agreed the professor. \"Our only chance is to rise to the\nsurface, for I do not believe the creature will follow us there. Empty\nthe tanks, Washington.\"\n\nThe colored man started the pumps, and the professor watched the gages\nthat told the depth of the craft. The pointer should have begun to swing\naround in a few seconds after the tanks began to empty. Instead it\nremained stationary.\n\n\"Strange,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"I wonder if anything is wrong with the\nmachinery.\"\n\n\"More like the whale, or whatever it is, is on top of the boat, holding\nher down,\" suggested Andy.\n\nThere was no doubt of this a moment later, for there were several\nviolent blows on the upper part of the _Porpoise_.\n\nThe crew of the submarine were held prisoners below the surface by the\nunknown monster!\n\nFor a few minutes the thought of the awful fate that would be theirs if\nthe ship should be wrecked under the water made each one speechless. As\nthey stood looking at each other, not knowing what to do, the attack was\nrenewed on the port side.\n\nThe big fish, whale or whatever it was, kept pounding away.\n\n\"I have an idea!\" cried Andy suddenly.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the professor quickly.\n\n\"Let me put a diving dress on,\" began the old hunter.\n\n\"I tell you we can't sink to the bottom in this depth of water,\"\ninterrupted the professor.\n\n\"We don't need to,\" put in Andy. \"All I want is a diving suit and a\nchance to stand out in the diving chamber. I guess I can fix Mr. Whale,\nif I have one of those electric guns.\"\n\n\"Quick! Get a diving suit, Washington!\" cried Mr. Henderson. He saw what\nthe old hunter planned to do.\n\nIn a few minutes Andy was dressed in the suit. The attacks of the\nmonster had redoubled in frequency, and the ship rocked as in a storm.\n\nAndy stepped into the diving chamber, clasping the electric gun. The\ninner door was tightly closed and then the sea cocks that admitted water\nfrom the outside were opened. When the pressure inside the chamber was\nequal to that of the ocean outside some one pulled the lever that\nopened the outer door.\n\nAndy knew better than to step outside. He remained in the chamber, like\na sentinel hid in the embrasure of a wall, for the chamber was a sort of\nbig dent in the side of the _Porpoise_.\n\nOnce more the ship rocked from a terrific blow, and the old hunter was\nnearly thrown out and into the fathomless depths below.\n\nHe clung to the door lever and peered out. Through the big glass eyes of\nhis copper helmet he saw headed straight at him a whale that seemed\nlarger than the submarine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nCAUGHT IN A SEA OF GRASS\n\n\n\"It's all up with me and the ship, too,\" thought Andy as he stood in the\nsmall chamber and watched the oncoming of the monster.\n\nHowever, he was not going to die without a fight, so he raised the\nelectric gun. Yet he knew it was a most forlorn chance.\n\nHe aimed straight down the big open mouth and pulled the trigger. The\nnext instant the water all about him was a mass of foam, through which\nhe could dimly see that the whale had halted.\n\nAnd, as the old hunter watched, in awe and fear at what he saw, he noted\nthat instead of one monster there seemed to be a pair. Together they\nwere threshing the sea into a bloody foam.\n\nThen, turning on the searchlight in his helmet, Andy beheld a terrible\nsight. The whale had been attacked by a gigantic swordfish at the moment\nthe hunter had fired the shot, and it was that, and not the electric\nbullet, that had stopped the infuriated animal's rush at the ship.\n\nAncient enemies, the whale and swordfish, had met in mortal combat. The\nswordfish had engaged the whale just as it was about to strike what\nwould probably have been a blow that would have disabled the submarine,\nfor with the door of the diving chamber open, the onslaught might not\nhave been withstood.\n\nRushing here and there, the whale seeking to destroy his enemy with a\nsweep of the enormous flukes, and the swordfish plunging his bony weapon\nagain and again into the whale, the two monsters fought until the water\nabout the ship was a mass of foam and blood.\n\nMuch as he wanted to see the end of the fight, Andy knew it was\ndangerous to remain longer with the door open.\n\nHe closed it, pressed the lever which started the pumps, forcing the\nwater from the chamber and, in a few minutes, emerged into the interior\nof the ship.\n\nMr. Henderson, realizing that something out of the ordinary was going\non, had opened the slides of the bull's-eye windows, and those in the\nsubmarine saw part of the fight between the whale and swordfish.\n\nAs soon as Andy had removed his diving suit he advised that the ship be\nsent to the surface, as there might be danger should the monsters get\ntoo close in their struggles.\n\nAccordingly the pumps, which had been stopped when it was found\nimpossible to raise the ship, because of the weight of the whale, were\nstarted and the _Porpoise_ was soon on the surface.\n\nThe manhole cover was opened and Andy, with Jack and Mark, went out on\ndeck. They had no sooner stepped out on the platform than there was a\ncommotion in the water.\n\n\"They're going to fight up here!\" exclaimed Mark.\n\nA big body shot upward and fell back with a splash, rocking the\nsubmarine.\n\n\"There's the whale,\" observed Andy. \"But I reckon he won't fight any\nmore. He's dead.\"\n\nIt was so. The swordfish had conquered, and the lifeless body of the\nwhale floated on top of the water, only to sink a little later.\n\n\"It was a great battle,\" said Jack. \"I'm glad I was inside the ship.\"\n\nThe course was due south, and every minute it seemed to the boys that it\nwas getting warmer, for they were approaching the equator. Every hour\nbrought them nearer the south pole, though they were still several\nthousand miles from it.\n\nAfter a while quite a wind sprang up, and as the sea roughened the\nprofessor decided to go down under the surface. The _Porpoise_ sunk as\nthe tanks filled and, in a little while, the submarine was in calm\nwater, and was forging ahead at three-quarter speed.\n\nIt was three days after the adventure with the whale when, as the ship\nwas going along at a good rate, that there seemed to be a gradual\nslacking in the progress.\n\n\"I wonder what Washington is slowing down for,\" said the professor\nrising from the dinner table at which all save the colored man had been\nsitting. \"I told him to keep right on. He must have seen something\nahead. I'll take a look.\"\n\nThe inventor went to the conning tower, where Washington was steering.\n\n\"What are you stopping for?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm not slowin' down,\" replied the colored man. \"Guess another ob dem\ndebil fishes has grabbed holt ob de ship. Dey suttinly am de most\nkoslostrous conglomerations ob inconsequence dat I eber see.\"\n\n\"You must keep your big words for another time,\" remarked Mr. Henderson,\nwho seemed worried. \"Hurry to the engine-room and see if the machinery\nis all right. We certainly are slowing down, from some cause or other.\"\n\nThe _Porpoise_ was now scarcely moving, though from the vibration it was\nevident that the engines were working almost at top speed. Washington\ncame back and reported that the big screw was revolving properly and\nthat all the machinery was working well.\n\n\"Then we're caught in something,\" said the professor. \"Shut off the\npower, Washington, I don't want to strain things.\"\n\nThe ship was now scarcely making a foot a minute, and, a little later,\nwhen the colored man had turned off the engine, the submarine became\nstationary, merely undulating with the roll and heave of the ocean.\n\nHurrying to the cabin, Captain Henderson opened the side window\nshutters, turned off the electric lights and peered out.\n\n\"I can't see anything,\" he said. \"Yet I should be able to, as we are not\nvery deep.\"\n\nThe gage showed that the ship was submerged only thirty feet, and at\nthat depth there should have been no difficulty in seeing, at least\ndimly, objects under water. But the windows showed as black as night.\n\n\"Bring me one of the portable searchlights,\" called Mr. Henderson.\n\nWashington brought one, operated by a storage battery. Holding it so the\nreflector cast the beams out of the bull's-eye and into the water on the\nopposite side, the inventor peered forth.\n\n\"I was afraid of this!\" he murmured.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"We are caught in the Sargasso Sea,\" replied Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"The Sargasso Sea?\" repeated Mark, in a questioning tone. \"What is\nthat?\"\n\n\"It is a great sea of grass,\" replied the captain. \"An immense ocean of\nsea weed, that sometimes floats on the surface and sometimes a little\nbelow. The stalks or blades of the grass are very long and closely\nmatted together.\"\n\n\"Is there any danger?\" asked Andy in some alarm.\n\n\"Very much,\" answered the professor quietly. \"A ship, once fairly\nentangled in the grass or sea weed, seldom gets out. If it is a sailing\nship the weed clings to the rudder, making steerage impossible, and even\nin a strong wind the ship cannot get free of the mass. The grass winds\nabout the propellers of steamships, and holds them as tight as in a\nvise.\n\n\"Sometimes a great storm may tear the mass of weed loose from the bottom\nof the ocean, and then the ship is free. But the Sargasso Sea is the\ngraveyard of many a fine vessel.\"\n\nThe pumps were set going. Anxiously everyone watched the gage. The\npointer never moved, but remained at thirty feet. The _Porpoise_ was\ncaught.\n\n\"Well, since we can't go up, let us see if we can go down,\" said the\ninventor. \"Perhaps we can dive under the sea weed.\"\n\nThe cocks of the tanks were opened and the water rushed in. Under the\nweight of it the ship should have sunk to the bottom. Instead it\nremained just where it was, thirty feet below the surface.\n\n\"Try the screw again,\" suggested Andy, \"Maybe we can back out.\"\n\nThe big propeller in the tube was started going in a reverse direction,\nbut the _Porpoise_ only moved a few feet and then stopped. To go forward\nwas equally impossible.\n\nThe submarine was held fast in the grip of the long, sinuous, snake-like\nfingers of the terrible sea grass. Weak as one strand was, the thousands\ncombined served to fasten the ship as securely as wire cables would have\ndone. The weeds had entangled themselves all around the craft and\nrefused to let go.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Henderson when all efforts had failed. \"We must\nthink of a new plan.\"\n\nHe spoke cheerfully, for he did not want the boys and other members of\nthe crew to know how worried he was. This was a danger he had never\ncounted on when he planned to go to the south pole.\n\n\"There is no great hurry,\" Mr. Henderson went on in a few minutes. \"We\ncan stay here for several days if need be, and by that time a storm may\ntear the grass loose.\"\n\n\"If we had our old hay sythes here,\" spoke Bill, \"me an' Tom could put\non divin' suits an' go out an' cut the sea weed.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that wouldn't work,\" answered Mr. Henderson. \"I'll think up\nsome plan, soon.\"\n\nHe started toward the engine room to look over the machinery. He was met\nby Washington, who seemed much alarmed.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the inventor.\n\n\"De air tank hab busted an' all de air is escapin' out!\" cried the\ncolored man. \"We'll all smothercate!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFIRE ON BOARD\n\n\nThe professor jumped past Washington and hurried into the room where the\ntanks were kept, carrying the reserve supply of air for breathing when\nthe ship was under water. A loud hissing told that the leak was a large\none.\n\n\"Quick! Bring me some tools and a steel plug,\" shouted the captain.\n\nMark hurried in with the things the professor wanted. But before the\nplug could be put in the hole the air stopped hissing.\n\n\"The leak is fixed!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"No,\" said the professor in a strange voice.\n\n\"But the air no longer rushes out.\"\n\n\"For a good reason, there is no longer any air to rush out. It is all\ngone!\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that all the reserve stock has been lost?\" exclaimed\nAndy.\n\n\"I fear so. The leak must have been a bad one. The air was stored in\ntanks under pressure, and, as you know, we released it as we needed it.\nNow it is all gone.\"\n\n\"All? Then we shall smother,\" said Jack, and his voice trembled.\n\n\"Not at once,\" went on Mr. Henderson in a calm voice. \"There is enough\nair in the entire ship, including that which has leaked from the tanks\nto last us five hours. After that----\" he paused and looked at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Andy. \"After that?\"\n\n\"There is enough stored in the small tanks of the diving suits to last\nanother two hours, perhaps. Seven hours in all.\"\n\n\"Then what?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"We shall smother to death,\" said the professor in a low tone. \"That\nis,\" he went on, \"unless before that time we can raise the _Porpoise_ to\nthe surface of the sea and get a fresh supply of air.\"\n\n\"Then we must work to raise the ship,\" put in Bill. \"Let' get out and\nsee if we can't cut through the sea weed.\"\n\n\"It would be useless,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"We can only depend on the\npower of the ship herself. But do not be discouraged. We may escape.\nCome, Washington, start the engine again. By keeping it going constantly\nwe can, perhaps, break loose from the grass. It is our only hope.\"\n\nSteadily the machinery worked. It might as well have remained\nstationary, however, as far as any noticeable effect was made on the\nboat's progress. The grass of the Sargasso Sea held the _Porpoise_ in a\nfirm grasp.\n\nFour hours passed. There was nothing to do but wait and see what would\nhappen. It all depended on the engines. Silently the navigators of the\nrealms under the ocean sat and hoped. Now and then the professor would\ngo to the engine room to adjust the machines.\n\nThe atmosphere in the cabin was growing noticeably heavier. The boys'\nheads began to ring with strange noises, and there was a tightness\nacross their chests. The lack of fresh air was beginning to tell.\n\n\"We might as well use that in the diving suit reservoirs,\" remarked the\nprofessor. \"We will feel better, at least for a little while.\"\n\nThe helmets of the suits were brought in, and the vapor released from\nthe small tanks. A change was at once noticed. The old stale air in the\ncabin was forced out of the exhaust pipes, and the fresh took its place.\nEvery one felt better.\n\nFaster and faster revolved the big screw. The ship vibrated more and\nmore. Yet it did not move, nor did it rise. The crew were still\nprisoners beneath the water.\n\nFor an hour or so conditions were fairly comfortable. Then the same\nunpleasantness was experienced as was noticed before.\n\n\"If we could only open a window,\" sighed Mark, \"and let in a lot of\nfresh air, how nice it would be.\"\n\nThe air rapidly became more foul. Soon Washington was gasping for\nbreath. Tom and Bill showed signs of uneasiness.\n\n\"Lie down on the floor,\" counseled the professor. \"You will find the air\na little fresher down there.\"\n\nThey all did as he advised, the inventor himself stretching out at full\nlength. A little relief was experienced.\n\nThey knew it could not last long. Even the professor seemed to have\ngiven up hope. The engine was not going to free the ship in time to save\nthe lives of those on board.\n\nWashington crawled to the engine room, as some of the bearings needed\noiling. The professor seemed in despair. He opened one of the slides\nthat covered the glass bulls eye windows. Then he turned off the\nelectric lights. The opening was black, showing that the sea of grass\nstill surrounded them. With a groan Mr. Henderson turned aside. The last\nhope was gone. He sank down on the floor of the darkened cabin.\n\nJust then Mark happened to look at the bull's-eye. He saw a glimmer of\nlight. Then he noticed several fishes swimming about. The water was\nclear. The grass had disappeared from the vicinity of the window.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Mark to the professor.\n\nThe inventor peered forth. As he did so he uttered a cry. Then he\nstaggered rather than ran to the engine room.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he called to Washington.\n\n\"I jest let some ob de sulphuric acid out ob de storage battery tank,\"\nreplied the colored man.\n\n\"That's it! That's it!\" exclaimed the professor. \"Quick, let some more\nout, Washington. Let out all there is in that tank. It will save our\nlives.\"\n\nWonderingly Washington obeyed. The air in the ship was growing more foul\nevery second. It was hard to breathe even on the floor, and all were\ngasping for breath. A few minutes more and they would all become\nunconscious and death would come in a little while if the air was not\nfreshened.\n\nThe professor staggered back to the main cabin. He looked out of the\nbull's-eye windows. Then he exclaimed:\n\n\"See, it is getting lighter! Thank Heaven we are saved!\"\n\nThe next instant the ship began to move backward. Then with increasing\nspeed it pulled out of the grip of the long grass, and in another minute\nwas floating on top of the water, at the edge of the Sargasso Sea.\n\n\"Quick! Open the man hole cover!\" said Amos Henderson.\n\nWashington threw back the lever cams, and in rushed the fresh air. It\nwas a blessed relief from the terrible oppressiveness of the foul\natmosphere of the boat. They all breathed deeply, and, in a few minutes\nthe effects of their long imprisonment had passed off.\n\nThey went out on the small deck. It was getting dusk, and the reflection\nof the red sunset shone brightly on the heaving water.\n\n\"I 'spected I'd neber see dis again,\" said Washington. \"Thought suah I\nwas a gone chicken!\"\n\n\"We had a most fortunate escape,\" said the professor. \"You did the trick\nfor us when you let the acid run from that tank into the sea. It mingled\nwith the water and burned or ate through the stems of the grass so they\nno longer held the ship. I saw what had happened as soon as I looked out\nof the bull's-eye, and that's why I had you turn out all the acid you\ncould. It was just as if liquid fire had touched the sea weed and burnt\nit off.\"\n\n\"Golly!\" exclaimed Washington. \"Fust I know I'll be a perfessor myself!\"\n\nSupper was eaten with the ship on the surface of the ocean, for it was\nimpossible to go below until the leak in the air tanks had been\nrepaired. Work was begun on this the next day, and though it proved a\ndifficult job it was accomplished by Mr. Henderson and the boys.\n\nThere were several minor repairs to be made to the machinery, and it was\na week before all was in readiness for another descent beneath the\nwaves. In the meanwhile the craft had moved slowly southward on the\nsurface, where no very great speed was possible.\n\nToward evening, on the seventh day after their adventure with the\nSargasso Sea, the travelers closed the man hole, and with air tanks well\nfilled slowly sank beneath the waves. Supper was eaten at a depth of\nsixty feet, and after the meal, while Washington was washing the dishes,\nthe others sat and looked out through the bull's-eyes at the big fishes\nwhich floated past.\n\n\"I wouldn't like to catch one of them air things on my hook an' line,\"\nobserved Bill, as a particularly large fish went past. \"I reckon I'd\nhave trouble landin' him.\"\n\n\"More likely he'd pull you in,\" said Mark.\n\nFor several minutes they watched the strange procession of deep-sea\nlife. Presently Jack, who was sitting near the engine room door, sprang\nup. At the same instant there was the sound of an explosion.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" cried the professor.\n\n\"Come quick!\" yelled Washington.\n\n\"It's a fire!\" yelled Jack. \"One of the electrical fuses has blown out,\nand the ship is on fire!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE GHOST OF THE SUBMARINE\n\n\nThey all rushed toward the engine room. It was dark, because the lights\nhad gone out all over the ship, and they could see only by the glare of\nthe flames, which were increasing.\n\n\"Light one of the oil lanterns!\" called the professor, and Bill did so.\n\n\"Unreel the hose,\" the inventor continued, and Mark and Jack ran to do\nthis.\n\nIn a few minutes the line was stretched into the engine room, and water\nwas being thrown on the flames, for Washington had started the pump as\nsoon as he saw the conflagration.\n\nThe fire was in one corner, near the electrical switch board, and had\nbeen caused by the blowing out of one of the fuses, which occasioned the\nlittle explosion. The wood work near the switches was blazing fiercely,\nand soon the ship was filled with smoke.\n\n\"Empty the ballast tanks!\" called the professor. \"We must rise to the\nsurface!\"\n\n\"We'll all be burned up!\" cried Tom. \"First we nearly smother and then\nwe get on fire. Neber saw such luck!\"\n\nWith a rush the _Porpoise_ began to rise, as her tanks were lightened.\nWith steady hands, though with fear in their hearts, Jack and Mark\ncontinued to play the water on the flames, while the professor and\nWashington got out a second line and aided them.\n\n\"The fire is dying out!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"We'll soon get the\nbest of it.\"\n\nIn five minutes the worst was over, though it had been an anxious time,\nand one of danger. The ship came to the surface, and the open man-hole\nlet out the thick smoke that had nearly suffocated the travelers.\n\nAs soon as it was cool enough in the engine room an examination was made\nof the damage done. It was not as bad as the professor had feared, and\nthe running part of the ship was not harmed. A new fuse was put in and\nthe electric lights turned on.\n\nThe night was spent with the ship floating on the surface of the ocean,\nonly enough speed being kept up to give her steerage way. The professor\ndid not want to go below the waves until he had repaired the switch\nboard.\n\nWatch was kept, for, though they were out of the regular line of ocean\ntravel, there was no telling when a vessel might come along and run\nthem down, for the _Porpoise_ did not show above the waves more than a\nfew feet, and carried no lights.\n\nMark had the watch just after midnight, and was sitting in the conning\ntower, the door of which opened out on the small deck. He had swept the\nsurface of the water with powerful glasses and was sure there were no\nships in sight. So, feeling that he would like to stretch his legs, he\nwalked up and down on the platform.\n\nHe had reached the after end, and was about to turn and go back, when he\nwas startled to see between him and the conning tower a white object. At\nfirst Mark thought it was a cloud of mist, or something the matter with\nhis eyes. He rubbed them, but the object did not disappear.\n\nThen it moved, and, to his horror Mark saw that it had the shape of a\nman, tall and thin. The two arms were outstretched, and to Mark's\nimagination seemed to be pointed toward him.\n\nIn spite of trying not to be, Mark was frightened.\n\nHe did not believe in ghosts, and had always felt that all stories about\nthem were due to persons' imaginations. Now he saw something that was\nhard to explain.\n\nAs he watched it, the white object turned and glided without making the\nslightest noise, toward the conning tower. It entered and Mark breathed\na sigh of relief.\n\nPerhaps, after all, it was some one from down in the cabin, maybe the\nprofessor himself in his night shirt, who had come up to see that all\nwas right.\n\n\"I'll go and look,\" said Mark to himself.\n\nHe had to nerve himself for the ordeal, as, in spite of assuring himself\nthat there were no such things as ghosts, he was frightened.\n\nIt was absolutely quiet. The only sound was the gentle swish of the\nwater against the sides of the ship. The engine was running so slowly\nthat it caused no noise.\n\nHalf way on his journey to the conning tower Mark paused. There,\nadvancing toward him, was the white object. With outstretched arms it\nglided nearer and nearer until Mark's heart was beating as if it would\nburst through his ribs. His mouth was dry and he could not have cried\nout had he tried.\n\nThere was a splash in the water off to the left as some big fish sprang\nout and dropped back again. Involuntarily Mark turned in that direction.\nThen he thought of the ghost and looked for it again. To his surprise\nthe white object was nowhere to be seen!\n\nThe boy waited a few minutes, and then, screwing up his courage, he went\nto the tower. There was no one inside, and, along the length of deck\nnothing was to be seen of the ghost.\n\n\"I wonder if I have been asleep and dreaming,\" the boy asked himself. He\ngave his leg a pinch, and the sensation of pain told him he was not\nslumbering.\n\n\"Well, I'll say nothing about it,\" Mark went on to himself. \"They'll\nonly laugh at me.\"\n\nEntering the tower Mark looked for the glasses in order to make another\nobservation. He could not find them, yet he was sure he had left them on\na shelf in the tower.\n\n\"I wonder if the ghost took them,\" he said.\n\nHe heard some one coming up the iron stairs of the small companionway\nthat led down into the interior of the ship through the man-hole. At\nfirst he thought it was his queer midnight visitor returning. Then the\nhead and shoulders of Jack appeared.\n\n\"I've come to relieve you,\" said Jack. \"Your watch is up; it's two\no'clock. Here are the night glasses. I found them on the cabin table. I\nthought you had them with you.\"\n\n\"I did,\" replied Mark.\n\n\"Then how did they get below?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" said Mark.\n\nThe mystery was deepening, yet he did not want to tell Jack just yet.\n\n\"Well, that's queer,\" remarked Jack. \"Maybe the captain came up and got\nthem while you were asleep.\"\n\n\"I didn't go to sleep,\" answered Mark rather crossly.\n\nJack said nothing more, but took his place in the conning tower, while\nMark went below. Thinking to discover if the ghost might by any chance\nhave been one of the persons on the _Porpoise_, Mark looked into each\nbunk. From the captain to Washington, all the inmates were peacefully\nslumbering.\n\n\"Queer,\" murmured Jack, as he took a look into the engine room before\nturning in. The engine needed no attention, as it worked automatically,\nand all there was to do was to steer the ship. Even this needed little\ncare as the course was a straight one, and the wheel could be locked,\nleaving the lookout little to do.\n\n\"Did you see anything during your watch?\" asked Mark of Jack the next\nmorning.\n\n\"See anything? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean anything unusual.\"\n\n\"Nothing, only a school of porpoises went past and gave me a little\nscare. They were like a lot of water kittens at play.\"\n\nMark concluded he would say nothing of the white visitor until he\nascertained whether any one else had seen it.\n\nIt was several nights later, when the ship was once more proceeding\nslowly along the surface of the water, that the ghost again appeared.\nThis time Washington had the midnight watch.\n\nBut the colored man was not one to remain quiet when he had such a scary\nvisitor, and his yells aroused the ship.\n\n\"It's a ghostess! A big white ghostess!\" yelled Washington. \"I don seen\nit wid my eyes, an' it waved his arms at me. I's goin' to die suah!\"\n\n\"What's all this nonsense?\" demanded the professor sternly. Then\nWashington, more or less excitedly, told of what he had seen. It was\njust as it had happened to Mark.\n\n\"You were dreaming,\" said the professor to Washington. \"There are no\nsuch things as ghosts.\"\n\nEvery one, from old Andy to Tom and Bill, had been roused by\nWashington's cries, and listened to his story. At the close of the\nrecital of how the white thing had suddenly disappeared, Washington\nrefused to continue his watch, unless some one stayed with him.\n\nMark volunteered to do this. He was anxious to see if the ghost would\nreappear to him. But nothing happened; and the rest of the night passed\noff quietly.\n\nThe next day the _Porpoise_ was taken below the surface, in order to\nallow of better speed being made. She was running along, submerged to a\ndepth of two hundred feet, when there came a sudden jar, and the ship\nstopped.\n\n\"More trouble!\" exclaimed the professor.\n\nHe opened the slide covering the bull's-eye windows and looked out. All\nabout was swirling muddy water.\n\n\"Can you see anything?\" the inventor called to Jack, who was in the\nconning tower.\n\n\"We've run into a mud-bank, and are stuck fast,\" called back the boy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nDIGGING OUT THE SHIP\n\n\n\"Reverse the engine!\" called the professor. \"Maybe we can back the ship\nout.\"\n\nWashington set the big screw to revolving in the opposite direction. The\n_Porpoise_ shook and shivered but the mud held her fast.\n\n\"We must have gone in pretty deep,\" commented Amos Henderson. \"Luckily\nit was soft mud instead of a rocky reef or we'd have damaged the ship\nbeyond repair.\"\n\nFor several minutes the engines were kept on the reverse, but all to no\npurpose. The sticky mud was like glue in its holding power and the ship\nhad buried her prow deep into it.\n\n\"I guess we'll have to dig our way out,\" said the professor, after\ntaking a careful view of the big mud bank from the conning tower.\n\"Washington, get out the diving suits and the spades.\"\n\n\"Are we really going out in the water to dig?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"You'll be as safe as in the ship,\nwearing one of my diving suits. We'll all have to help, for it will be\nquite a task.\"\n\nThe queer suits were brought out, and the reservoirs in the helmets were\nfilled with compressed air. It was decided to have Washington remain\nwithin the _Porpoise_, to watch the machinery and start the engine when\nthe digging was partly done, in order to see if the ship would not pull\nherself free when some of the mud had been removed from the prow.\n\n\"And we may need Washington for another purpose,\" said the professor.\n\n\"What for?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Well, he'll have to stay by the diving tank, to let us in quickly in\ncase of emergency.\"\n\n\"Do you think there'll be an emergency?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"You never can tell,\" was the answer. \"We are in deep water, and I don't\nwant any accidents to happen.\"\n\nIn a few minutes all save Washington were in their diving suits and\nready to go out and walk on the bottom of the sea. They entered the\ntank, the door was closed, and then water was slowly admitted from the\nocean. When the tank was full, led by the professor, they stepped out on\nthe muddy floor of the ocean.\n\nAt first the pressure of the water at so great a depth bothered them.\nBut, as we know, the diving suits were reinforced with plates of steel,\nand so strong that little more than an extra weight of water was\nnoticed. They soon became used to it. Each one carried a spade, while\nthe professor, Andy and the boys each had, slung about their necks by\nstraps, one of the electric guns.\n\nCautiously they walked toward the big mud bank. They had to go slowly\nbecause of the weight of the water above them, and because they might at\nany minute step into some muck hole and sink down. Fortunately, however,\nthey found there was a firm bottom right up to where the bank of mud\nreared upward.\n\nTurning on the electric lights in their helmets, the voyagers were able\nto see quite distinctly. The _Porpoise_ had rammed her nose into the\nunder-water hill for a distance of about ten feet. It was going to be no\neasy matter to get her free, but the divers lost no time.\n\nVigorously they attacked the big hill of mud. They dug their spades in\nand tossed the earth to one side. It was a strange place to work. At\nfirst the weight of water hampered every one, but they soon became used\nto it and were able to proceed more rapidly.\n\nFrom the conning tower Washington kept watch of their progress. When\nthey had gone in about five feet he started the engines, hoping the\n_Porpoise_ might now pull herself free. But the mud still held.\n\nBy signs, for it was of course impossible for any one to hear or speak,\nattired as they were in helmets and suits, the professor motioned that\nthey must dig deeper.\n\nOnce more they attacked the big mud bank with their shovels. Farther and\nfarther they went into the muck until it seemed that the nose of the\nsubmarine must be free. But when Washington started the engines it was\nobvious that the ship was still held.\n\nAgain the digging was resumed. All at once, while every one was wielding\nhis spade to best advantage, a shadow seemed to cover the water. It\nloomed up large and black, and the professor stopped and gazed upward.\nWhat he saw made him drop his spade and grab the gun that was about his\nneck.\n\nFloating in the water above the diggers, were three immense sharks.\nTheir cruel mouths were partly open, showing three rows of big teeth,\nand they were slowly turning over on their backs to make a sudden rush\nand devour the men and boys. Owing to the peculiar shape of its maw a\nshark can not bite until it turns over.\n\nThe professor motioned for Bill and Tom to move behind him, and\nsignalled for Jack, Mark and Andy to stand close with their weapons\nready.\n\nThe sharks floated lazily downward as if they knew they had the diggers\nat their mercy. To run and escape was impossible, for no one could run\nhampered by the weight of water and his diving suit.\n\nOne of the terrible fish opened its mouth wider and, with a flirt of its\ntail aimed straight for the professor. Mr. Henderson raised his gun, and\ntook careful aim at the middle of the fish, half turned over. Unerringly\nthe electric bullet sped on its way. It entered the soft under part of\nthe shark, and immediately the thing struggled in its death agony.\n\nThe water was dyed with blood. At the same instant the other sharks\nrushed forward in a swirl of foam. The boys and Andy fired as best they\ncould, and must have hit one of the creatures for there was a greater\ncommotion.\n\nBut the fight was not over. Instantly the ocean seemed alive with the\ngiant fish. Attracted by the blood of the killed ones, scores of the\ntigers of the seas rushed toward the scene of combat making matters\nlivelier than ever.\n\nThe professor, the boys and Andy fired their guns at random. Redder and\nmore red became the water until their helmet lamps barely glowed in the\ncrimson sea. It seemed that a whole army of the voracious sharks had\nattacked them.\n\nThe professor realized that to stay and attempt to fight all the sharks\nin that part of the ocean was impossible. He motioned for the boys and\nAndy to follow him. Then he slowly led the way back to the ship.\n\nBut the sharks were not to be gotten rid of so easily. Several of the\nlargest followed the diggers, their horrible eyes, and big mouths with\nrows of cruel teeth, striking terror to the hearts of all.\n\nOne of the creatures made a rush for Bill and Tom who were close\ntogether. Either or both of the men would have been bitten in twain, in\nspite of the protection of their diving suits, had not Mark, with a snap\nshot, killed the fierce fish.\n\nIt was now a running fight, and yet not so much that, because to run was\nimpossible. However, they hurried all they could, and, by dint of quick\nfiring kept the ugly creatures at bay until the side of the ship, where\nthe diving tank was placed, was reached.\n\nThe professor stepped to one side, and motioned for the others to\nproceed him in entering. Little time was lost. As Bill, the last one in,\nstepped past the steel door the inventor attempted to enter. To do so he\nhad to let go of his gun.\n\nInstantly one of the sharks made a rush for the old man. But Andy was\non the watch. He leaned forward, and, from his weapon sent a bullet\nstraight down the throat of the monster. The electric missile did its\nwork well, and the lifeless body of the shark was devoured by the others\nof its tribe.\n\nThe professor pulled the door shut behind him. Then he set the pump to\nwork to empty the tank. As he did so there was a tremor to the ship.\nWhat could it mean?\n\nIn a few minutes the tank was empty and the divers stepped out into the\nship, freed from the oppressive weight of water. The ship continued to\nvibrate and seemed to be in motion.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mark as soon as he had his helmet off.\n\n\"De ship am free! We've got off de mud bank!\" exclaimed Washington,\nrunning in from the engine room.\n\nIt was true. Enough had been dug so that, with the power of the screw\nworking backward, there was sufficient force to pull the _Porpoise_ from\nher perilous position.\n\n\"Empty the tanks and rise to the surface,\" said the professor.\n\nIn a few minutes the ship was on top of the waves, the adventurers freed\nfrom the double danger of the mud and sharks. They congratulated each\nother on the good outcome of the fight with the monster fishes.\n\nWearied with their labors and the battle under the waves, the travelers\nsat up on the deck breathing in the fresh breeze. Then, after a while,\nsupper was made ready and eaten with good appetites.\n\nIt was decided hereafter to sail along near the surface at night, and\nnot to submerge the ship deeply save during daylight, when it was easier\nto distinguish objects under the water.\n\nFollowing this plan the _Porpoise_ steamed along just awash that night,\nand the next day was sent down about fifty feet below the surface.\n\nOne afternoon, when the travelers were resting, having partaken of a\nfine meal, the professor went on deck to make some observations, the\nship having been raised for that purpose. He came down, somewhat\nexcited.\n\n\"Well, we're half way to the pole,\" he announced.\n\n\"How can you tell?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Because we have just crossed the equator. We went over the imaginary\nline three minutes ago.\"\n\n\"I was wondering what made it so warm,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I guess you dreamed it was hotter,\" spoke the professor. \"It has been\njust as hot as this for the last few days. Crossing the line makes no\ndifference.\"\n\n\"Then we are really in the southern hemisphere now,\" said Mark.\n\n\"That's where we are,\" replied Mr. Henderson.\n\nHe put his instruments away.\n\n\"Well, we may as well go below the surface again,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Come quick! Hurry up!\" yelled Washington from the deck. \"Dar's a\nshipwreck up heah! Somebody's on it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE STRANGE SHIPWRECK\n\n\nThe professor, followed by the boys and Tom, Bill and Andy hastened on\ndeck. They saw Washington pointing excitedly off to the west. There,\nrising and falling on the easy swell, was the wreck of a large vessel.\n\nShe had been a three masted schooner, but now only the stumps of the\nmasts remained and the craft was rolling to and fro. It had settled low\nin the water, and was quite deep by the head, so that, at times, the\nwaves broke over the bow in a shower of spray.\n\nBut what attracted the attention of the adventurers more than anything\nelse was the sight of two figures near what had been the after cabin of\nthe ship.\n\nThere they stood, frantically waving their hands toward those on the\nsubmarine. Across the water that separated the two craft, there came a\nfaint hail.\n\n\"I suppose they are nearly dead,\" exclaimed the inventor. \"We must save\nthem.\"\n\nHe ordered the _Porpoise_ sent ahead slowly toward the wreck. The\ndistance was about half a mile, and was soon covered. As the submarine\napproached closer those on the schooner could be observed more plainly.\n\n\"One of 'em is a woman!\" exclaimed Jack, who was using the glasses.\n\n\"Let me see,\" spoke the professor.\n\n\"You're right,\" he added. \"The other is a little girl.\"\n\nA few minutes later the _Porpoise_ was alongside. The woman and child\ncame to the rail of the schooner, which was barely five feet above the\nwaves.\n\n\"Can you jump down, or shall I come aboard and get you?\" asked Mr.\nHenderson seeing the woman hesitate.\n\n\"I can jump down, if you will catch the child,\" said the woman. \"Oh I am\nso glad you came,\" she added. \"We are almost dead from hunger and\nthirst, and the wreck is ready to sink and cannot last many hours\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Pass the little girl down to me,\" spoke Andy. \"Then you jump. We'll\nsave you all right.\"\n\nThe little girl reached the deck in safety, and the woman, who proved to\nbe her mother, followed.\n\n\"Now take us to your ship,\" said the woman.\n\n\"You must be a long way from her, as she is not in sight.\"\n\n\"Our ship is right here,\" spoke Mr. Henderson with a smile.\n\n\"Where, I don't see her,\" and the woman looked in all directions.\n\n\"Allow me to introduce you to Profess Amos Henderson's famous submarine,\nthe _Porpoise_,\" spoke the inventor with a bow. \"But come, let us go\nbelow. You must be suffering, and here I am making speeches.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am hungry, and thirsty too,\" said the woman. \"So is Nellie.\nBut I thought this was merely a small boat, sent from some large ship to\nget us.\"\n\nThe woman and girl descended to the cabin of the submarine, where\nWashington set before them a fine meal. Under the advice of the\nprofessor they partook sparingly of food and drink at first, as, having\neaten nothing in many hours, the inventor said they must begin by taking\na little at a time.\n\nAs soon as they had finished and become somewhat rested, the woman told\nher story. She was Mrs. Johnson, a widow, her husband having once owned\nand been captain of the schooner that was wrecked. After his death she\nand her daughter, having become part owners of the craft, disposing of\na third interest to the former mate of the ship, had set out on one of\nthe voyages to South American ports.\n\nThey had had good weather going, and took on a valuable cargo of lumber\nand rare woods. But the return trip was more perilous. Heavy storms had\nbuffeted the craft almost from the time of leaving port, and in one\nheavy blow, ten days before, the ship had been wrecked.\n\n\"What became of the crew?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"They took to the boats,\" replied Mrs. Johnson. \"My little girl and\nmyself were to go with the mate and his men. The waves were fearfully\nhigh, and, as they held the boat close to the schooner so we could get\nin, a big roller smashed the little craft. The men must have all been\ndrowned for I never afterwards caught sight of one of them.\"\n\n\"But the other boats?\" asked the inventor.\n\n\"They had gotten too far away to hail, supposing that I would be taken\ncare of by the mate. There was nothing for Nellie and I to do but stay\non board, expecting the ship to sink every minute.\"\n\n\"And you have been there ever since?\" inquired Andy.\n\n\"Ever since. That was ten days ago. Every day I thought it would be our\nlast. The storm passed away and the sea became calm but the ship kept\nsettling lower and lower. Only the fact that part of the cargo was wood\nkept her afloat so long. I managed to get some provisions and water up\non deck, but the sea had spoiled most of the stuff. We had to eat only a\nlittle at a time, as I knew it would be some days before we could be\nrescued, if we ever were. Two days ago we ate the last of the food and\ndrank almost the last of the water.\"\n\n\"Then you had nothing since then,\" spoke Jack.\n\n\"Only a few drops of rain that I caught on a piece of sail,\" answered\nMrs. Johnson.\n\n\"Never mind, you can have all you want now, mother,\" said Nellie, coming\nover to pat her parent's cheek. \"Oh,\" the child went on, \"I was so\nthirsty I could just cry when I thought of such things as ice cream\nsodas.\"\n\n\"I guess you could,\" agreed Mark. \"Well, we can't give you any soda\nwater, but we have plenty of the other kind.\"\n\nMrs. Johnson was much interested in the _Porpoise_ and Professor\nHenderson showed her all about the craft. Though the quarters were\nrather cramped, a small cabin was fitted up for the lady and her\ndaughter.\n\n\"We will travel a bit under the water so you can get used to it,\" said\nthe captain after a tour of the ship had been made. The tanks were\nfilled, and the _Porpoise_ sank beneath the waves. At first Mrs. Johnson\nwas much frightened, and Nellie cried. But when they saw how skillfully\nthe ship was managed, and how easy it was to rise again, they lost their\nfears.\n\nFor several days the voyage was continued. Mrs. Johnson and Nellie\nremained aboard as there was no place to land them, and they said they\nwished to stay until they met some ship sailing north.\n\nOne day, just at dusk, when the _Porpoise_, after a long run under the\nwater had come to the surface, the professor, came up on deck to take a\nlook around. Washington and Andy accompanied him.\n\n\"Looks like land, off there to the left,\" remarked the old hunter.\n\n\"Get the glasses, Washington,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"It may be a ship.\"\n\nHe took a long and careful look through the binoculars.\n\n\"It's some sort of land,\" he announced. \"We'll go over in the morning\nand see what it is. Probably it's an island, for there's no main land in\nthese parts. We are in the middle of the southern Atlantic now.\"\n\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the _Porpoise_ was headed toward the\ndark spot on the surface of the water that the professor had gazed at\nthe evening before. As they came nearer it was seen that the place was a\nlarge island.\n\n\"But it's a mighty queer one,\" spoke Mr. Henderson. \"It looks more like\na big volcano than anything else.\"\n\nAs the ship came nearer it was seen that this was true. The island rose\nabruptly from the surface of the sea in a big ridge, slightly rounded.\nThere appeared to be no signs of life on the land, but in the air\noverhead hovered several big birds. These circled about and then\nfluttered down, seemingly about the middle of the island.\n\n\"We'll sail around and see if there's a place to land,\" spoke the\ninventor. \"There doesn't seem to be a good harbor on this side.\"\n\nSlowly the _Porpoise_ made the circuit. The island appeared to be almost\nround. When they had gone about half way around Andy, who was staring\nahead, cried out:\n\n\"Look out Professor! Don't go any nearer or we'll be sucked into the\nwhirlpool!\"\n\nThe inventor looked where the hunter pointed. Then he beheld the\nstrangest sight he had ever seen. The island was low toward where Andy\npointed and they beheld the waters of the ocean pouring over the edge\nof it, and falling down into an immense hole with a roar like that of\nNiagara Falls.\n\n\"Reverse the ship!\" cried Professor Henderson. \"Send her back quickly,\nWashington, or we'll be sucked down!\"\n\nThe colored man lost no time, and the big screw was sent whirling in the\nopposite direction. And it was high time, for already the onward rush of\nthe falling waters was slowly drawing the ship toward the big cavern.\n\n\"That was a lucky escape,\" commented Amos Henderson. \"Well, as we can't\nland there we'll try the other way around.\"\n\nThe ship was headed in the opposite direction, and, after an hour's\nsailing, a good harbor was discovered. The _Porpoise_ was anchored in\nshallow water close to the shore and in a small boat the professor, Andy\nand the two boys went to the strange island.\n\nThey found it merely an immense circle of land with the middle part\ntaken up by the big hole. And such a hole as it was! It was so wide\nacross that they could not see the farther side, and the depth they\ncould only guess at. Looking down they could only see great rolling\nmasses of clouds or vapor.\n\n\"Perhaps it's steam,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"Maybe it is,\" agreed the professor. \"If this is a volcano, with lava in\nit, the water of the ocean, pouring in on the other side, may be changed\nto steam.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose this hole leads to the centre of the earth?\" asked Mark.\n\"I've read somewhere, that the earth is hollow.\"\n\n\"Some scientists believe it,\" commented the professor. \"This looks like\na big enough hole to lead clear through to China. Hark, you can hear the\nroar of the water now.\"\n\nThey listened, and the wind brought to them the sound of the sea pouring\ndown into the unfathomable depths.\n\n\"Let's throw a big rock down,\" suggested Jack. \"Maybe we can hear it\nstrike bottom.\"\n\nWith the aid of Mark he cast a big boulder down into the depths. They\nlistened intently, but not the slightest sound echoed back.\n\n\"I guess the bottom is too far away for you to hear the stone land,\"\nsaid the professor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE GHOST AGAIN\n\n\nThey spent some time looking down into the hole. The masses of vapor, or\nclouds, rolled and swirled hundreds of feet below them, but never broke\nsufficiently to allow of a clear sight.\n\n\"Well, we had better go back to the ship,\" remarked the professor. \"We\nmust continue our voyage.\"\n\nThey were soon on the _Porpoise_ and steaming away from the strange\nisland, the inventor deciding to get far off out of the influence of the\nterrible waterfall.\n\nThe night was, as usual, spent with the ship slowly steaming ahead on\nthe surface of the water. It was getting on toward twelve o'clock and\nWashington had the watch. He was to be relieved by Jack.\n\nThe latter had been awakened by the alarm clock at the head of his bed,\nwhich time-piece he had set to arouse him so that he might take\nWashington's place. Jack was just getting the sleep from his eyes by a\nvigorous rubbing when he heard a loud yell.\n\n\"Land a' Massy!\" cried Washington from the deck above. \"I's goin' t' die\nsuah! De ghostess am after me ag'in!\"\n\nWithout waiting to dress, Jack sprang up the ladder and was soon out on\nthe deck. He saw Washington kneeling down in front of the conning tower\ndoor while, at the after end of the deck, was a mysterious white object;\nthe same strange shape that had been observed before.\n\n\"I'm going to solve this puzzle!\" exclaimed Jack to himself as he made a\ndive toward the object in white. \"This ghost business will have to\nstop!\"\n\nBut, unfortunately for his plans, his foot slipped on the smooth steel\ndeck, and he went down in a heap. When he got up the ghost was nowhere\nto be seen.\n\nWashington, however, was still kneeling down and praying to be spared\nfrom the attack of the midnight visitor. Jack limped over to the colored\nman.\n\n\"Keep still,\" said the boy. \"It's gone now. What was it, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Some ghost from de grabeyard,\" replied Washington.\n\n\"When did you see it first?\" went on Jack.\n\n\"'Bout ten minutes ago,\" replied Washington.\n\n\"Well it's gone now,\" said Jack, though he had to admit to himself that\nthe affair was somewhat puzzling. Professor Henderson had been awakened\nby the yells of the colored man and came on deck to see what the trouble\nwas. He appeared somewhat annoyed when Washington told him what had\nhappened.\n\n\"There are no ghosts!\" declared the inventor in positive tones.\n\n\"You wouldn't say so, Perfessor, if you'd seen him,\" spoke Washington.\n\"He were all in white, tall an' slim, an' big red eyes, an' a green\nnose, an' fire comin' from his mouth an'--\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" interrupted Jack. \"It was nothing but a white object,\nProfessor Henderson. I saw it.\"\n\n\"And what do you think it was?\" asked the inventor.\n\n\"I--I can hardly say,\" replied Jack. \"Of course I don't believe in\nghosts, but this--\"\n\n\"It was probably a mist from the ocean,\" interrupted the professor.\n\"Don't let me hear any more of it. Washington, go below. Your watch is\nup and Jack will take charge. I don't believe there will be any more\nghosts.\"\n\nNor were there that night. The _Porpoise_ glided along, requiring little\nattention, and when morning broke was several miles nearer the southern\npole.\n\nThe journey was continued beneath the waves and it was found much cooler\nunder them than upon the surface, for the ship was in the midst of the\nequatorial heat.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon, when all was quiet aboard, there\ncame a sudden yell from the engine room. Washington's voice could be\nheard calling for help. Then it died away in a groan.\n\n\"Something has happened!\" called Jack. \"Washington is in trouble.\"\n\nHe hurried toward where the machinery could be heard buzzing. The\nprofessor, with Andy and Mark followed. They expected to see the colored\nman caught in some shaft or belt, but he was nowhere in sight.\n\n\"Perhaps he has fallen into the ocean,\" suggested Mark.\n\n\"The engine room does not open into the sea,\" answered the professor.\n\nA deep groan came from some corner of the engine room.\n\n\"There he is!\" cried Jack.\n\nBut a careful search failed to reveal Washington. Still he could be\nheard to groan at intervals. Bill and Tom came and aided in the search,\nwhile Mrs. Johnson, who was worried at the unusual activity, asked what\nthe trouble was.\n\nCaptain Henderson did not tell her, for, as he said afterward, he did\nnot want any women fainting away on his ship. At his request Mrs.\nJohnson went back to her cabin, and the hunt for Washington continued.\n\n\"Here he is!\" cried Jack at last.\n\nThe boy had climbed up on a small ladder that led to the big storage\nbattery tanks. He had looked down, and there, in the large metal box had\nspied the colored man on the bottom. Washington was unconscious and\nbreathing heavily.\n\n\"He has been overcome by the fumes of the sulphuric acid!\" exclaimed the\nprofessor. \"We must get him out quickly or he will die!\"\n\n\"I'll get him!\" cried Andy.\n\nThe old hunter grabbed a small step ladder that stood against the wall\nof the engine room. With this on his shoulder he climbed up the steps\nwhich led to the top of the storage battery tank. Then, by means of his\nladder, he descended inside.\n\nHe had to work quickly as the fumes were very strong, but he managed to\nhoist Washington up so that Bill and Tom, from outside, could take hold\nof him. Then the colored man was carried out on the deck, where the\nfresh air and some restoratives the professor used soon revived him.\n\n\"Is I dead,\" were Washington's first words, as he sat up and looked\nabout him.\n\n\"Not this time,\" replied the professor. \"You had a close call, though.\nHow did it happen?\"\n\nWashington explained that he started to clean the battery tank, when he\nlost his balance and fell in. He cried as he felt himself falling, but\nas soon as he struck the bottom of the tank the fumes of the chemicals\nmade him unconscious. His deep breathing, which had sounded like groans,\nalone served to attract attention to his location.\n\nIn a little while Washington was all right save for a slight weakness.\nCaptain Henderson made him go to his bunk, and ordered him to remain\nthere until morning.\n\nDuring the excitement over Washington's mishap all thought of steering\nthe ship had been forgotten, and when Mr. Henderson went to the conning\ntower about five o'clock he found that the _Porpoise_ was several points\noff her course and was headed to the east instead of to the south. How\nmany miles out of her way the craft had steamed could only be guessed,\nbut as she had been going wrong for nearly an hour, it must be quite a\nfew the inventor calculated.\n\nHowever, he said, no great harm had been done. Even this slight accident\nwould not have happened had not Bill, who was in the conning tower\nsteering, forgotten to put the automatic device in operation when he\nleft the wheel to join in the search for Washington.\n\n\"We'll soon make up the lost ground,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"Another week\nor ten days ought to see us at the end of our journey.\"\n\n\"And what will we do when we get there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"We will make some important geographical and scientific observations,\"\nsaid the professor. \"Not only that, but we will have done something that\nno living person has ever accomplished. We reached the north pole,\nthough we could not land on the exact spot. Let us hope we will be more\nsuccessful regarding the south pole.\"\n\nThe professor set the ship on her course again. Bill and Tom got supper\nin place of Washington, while Mrs. Johnson helped set the table.\n\nThe meal was eaten, and then the inventor started the ship toward the\nsurface, following the plan of not sailing beneath the waves after dark,\nin order to avoid accidents.\n\nThe craft was making good speed ahead, with the big screw revolving in\nthe tunnel and spurting the water from the rear, when there came a\nsudden jar, and everyone nearly toppled over from the quick stopping of\nthe _Porpoise_. At the same time the forward end seemed to go up in the\nair.\n\n\"What has happened? Are we sinking?\" cried Mrs. Johnson.\n\n\"I think we are going up,\" spoke the professor in cool tones.\n\n\"In the air?\" asked the lady.\n\n\"On the land,\" answered the inventor. \"I think we have struck shore and\nslid up on a beach.\"\n\nHe ordered the engine stopped and hurried to the conning tower to make\nan observation. He turned on the searchlight and looked carefully at\nwhat the beams showed. Then he came back to the cabin.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked Mrs. Johnson.\n\n\"We have gone ashore, just as I supposed,\" said Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"And whereabouts are we?\"\n\n\"On the coast of South America.\"\n\n\"Near where?\"\n\n\"Near Terra Del Fuego, the land of fire!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nATTACKED BY SAVAGES\n\n\n\"Are we in any danger?\" asked Mrs. Johnson.\n\n\"I hope not,\" replied the captain. \"If the ship is not strained the\nrising tide will probably float her safely, and we can continue our\ntrip. We will have to wait until morning to see, however.\"\n\n\"And if the ship is damaged?\"\n\n\"We will have to do what we can. We will hope for the best, madam.\"\n\nThe professor went on deck. His first opinion of the accident was\nconfirmed. The _Porpoise_, in emerging from the waves, had slid well up\non a sandy shore, where she was held fast because the tide was rapidly\nfalling. It would be twelve hours before there would be a chance of her\nfloating again.\n\nThe mishap had occurred because the ship had gotten off her course when\nWashington's accident occurred, and had not been set right in time.\n\nHowever, as Mr. Henderson had said, there was no particular danger,\nunless it was found that some of the plates had been strained, which\nmight cause a leak.\n\nThe night was passed with the nose of the _Porpoise_ well up on shore,\nand before morning, as the tide continued to fall, more and more of the\ncraft became exposed until the whole steel body rested on the sloping\nbeach.\n\nJack was the first to awaken. He was up with the sun, and went out on\nthe deck to take a view of the country he had often heard about. A\nstretch of wild landscape met his eyes, and to the left and right of the\nship the waves were breaking on jagged rocks.\n\n\"It's a good thing we didn't hit the rocks,\" thought the youth.\n\nMark came up on deck, and the two boys looked over the scene. It was a\nstrange one. Beyond the beach was a low level country, green in places,\nwith now and then a patch of what looked like trees.\n\n\"And what are those brown spots moving about?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I guess they are herds of cattle,\" replied Jack. \"You know South\nAmerica is a great place for them.\"\n\nFor half an hour the two lads gazed about. Except for the stern of the\n_Porpoise_ all of the craft was now out of water, and one could have\njumped from the low deck down to a mound of white sand of the beach.\n\n\"Let's go ashore and take a run,\" suggested Mark. \"I've almost forgotten\nhow to walk on dry land.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Jack. \"I'm with you.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nThe boys lost no time in getting down to the beach. They found it hard\nand firm, and made their way to the strip of grass-covered land lying\nbeyond. Up and down they wandered, finding many curious and beautifully\nmarked shells where the waves had washed them.\n\nSuddenly Jack gave a big jump and let out a yell.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I thought I saw one of those cocoanuts move,\" answered Jack, pointing\nto where several of the big shaggy fruits lay under a tree from which\nthey had fallen.\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" spoke Mark. \"I certainly saw one of them take a\nlittle side step. I wonder what does it.\"\n\nAs the boys watched they were surprised, to see one of the cocoanuts\ncome toward them, apparently advancing without any visible means of\nlocomotion.\n\n\"This is a queer country,\" remarked Jack, getting ready to run in case\nthe strangely moving cocoanut might be a warning of danger.\n\n\"Look! There's a whole lot of them moving,\" cried Mark.\n\nSure enough a dozen or more of the nuts began to advance toward the\nlads. The boys were not so much afraid as they were surprised. But a few\nseconds later the reason for the strange sight was made plain.\n\nAs they looked they saw one of the nuts roll down a little mound of\nsand. Then they noticed that a big land crab was on the tiny hill and it\nwas evident that the nut had fallen from his claws.\n\n\"It's the crabs!\" exclaimed Mark. \"I remember reading about them now.\nThey come ashore from the water where they live part of the time and get\nthe cocoanuts. Then they smash the shells by pounding the nuts on a\nstone and eat the white meat inside. They are called cocoanut crabs.\"\n\n\"I was beginning to think we were in some enchanted land,\" spoke Jack.\n\n\"Well, it certainly looked queer,\" agreed Mark.\n\nFor some time the boys watched the strange sight. Then they walked along\nthe beach, seeing several large star fish, and some big horse-shoe crabs\nthat had been stranded by the tide.\n\n\"Look at that immense turtle!\" exclaimed Mark, as one of the creatures\nscuttled over the sand toward the sea. \"I'll bet she's been laying\neggs!\"\n\n\"Perhaps so.\"\n\nThey made a rush for the tortoise but were not quick enough, for she\nslid into the water and made off.\n\n\"Here's her nest, anyhow,\" called Jack, as he pointed to some eggs,\nthinly covered with sand. \"Let's go back and take them with us. I've\nheard they are good eating.\"\n\nJack and Mark started to gather up as many of the eggs as they could in\ntheir hats. While they were thus engaged they heard a call from the ship\nand looked up to see coming toward them, all of the ship's company\nexcept Washington.\n\n\"I wonder if anything could have happened,\" spoke Mark.\n\nHe and Jack dropped the eggs and started on a run toward the stranded\nship. They were reassured, however, when they saw the professor waving\nhis hand at them. When he got within hailing distance the inventor\ncalled:\n\n\"It's all right, boys. We're just taking a little walk, before\nbreakfast, for an appetizer. It's been some time since we were on land.\nWashington says he'll have some fine fried ham for us in a little\nwhile.\"\n\n\"And here are the eggs to go with it,\" spoke Jack.\n\n\"Have you found a hen house?\" asked Mr. Henderson in some wonder.\n\n\"No, but we discovered a turtle, which is just as good,\" replied Mark.\nThe professor agreed with him, and called for Washington to come and get\nthe eggs.\n\n\"Wall I 'clare to goodness!\" exclaimed the colored man as he gathered\nthe product of the turtle up in his cook's apron. \"Dis suttinly am a\nqueer contraption of a country to find eggs growin' in de sand.\"\n\nHe shuffled back to the ship, while the others walked up and down on the\nbeach. In about half an hour the professor suggested that they return.\n\n\"Washington must have breakfast ready by now,\" he said, \"and I, for one,\nam hungry enough to enjoy it.\"\n\nThey turned toward the stranded _Porpoise_ but no sooner had their eyes\ntaken in the sweep of the ocean that lay before them than they uttered\ncries of fear.\n\nSpreading out from the beach in a big half circle that enclosed within\nits curve the submarine, were three score of canoes, each one filled\nwith half naked savages.\n\n\"The natives are going to attack the ship!\" cried the professor. \"We\nmust hurry back or we are lost!\"\n\nHe started on the run, accompanied by the boys and men. Mrs. Johnson and\nher daughter brought up the rear. The adventurers had gone from one\nmisfortune into another.\n\nAt the top of their speed they approached the stranded ship. The natives\nsaw them coming and the next instant hundreds of paddles broke the waves\ninto a mass of sparkling water as the wily savages urged their canoes\nswiftly toward the submarine.\n\n\"If we can only reach it first we can hold them off until the tide\nfloats us, and then we can escape,\" said the professor.\n\nHe increased his pace though the run was beginning to tell on his aged\nframe. The adventurers were now within an eighth of a mile of the ship,\nbut the savages were closer, and had the advantage of being able to make\ngreater speed. The two forces approached nearer and nearer. Finally the\nfirst of the canoes reached the submerged end of the _Porpoise_.\n\nWith wild shouts a score of the brown men leaped from the boats and\nscrambled up the steel sides. An instant later they were joined by\nseveral canoe loads of their companions. They swarmed up on the deck,\nand some peered down the winding stairs that led to the interior of the\nship.\n\n\"Too late!\" cried the professor. \"They have captured the _Porpoise_!\"\n\n\"But Washington is aboard!\" shouted Jack.\n\nAs he spoke the colored man was seen clambering up out of the companion\nway. He gave one look at the wild natives who swarmed over the ship, and\nthen, with a yell to be heard a long way off, disappeared below.\n\nThe shouts and cries of the savages grew louder and they seemed to be\ndoing a sort of war dance.\n\n\"We must make one effort to drive them away,\" said the professor in\ndesperation.\n\n\"We haven't even a revolver,\" spoke Andy.\n\n\"Let's use stones,\" suggested Jack, grabbing up a handful from the\nbeach.\n\n\"Look out!\" yelled Mark. \"They are going to shoot some arrows!\"\n\nA second later a flight of the weapons filled the air. Fortunately the\nnatives were too far away to permit the shots taking effect, but it\nshowed that they intend to fight and take possession of the ship.\n\nEven this did not frighten Mr. Henderson. His vessel was more than life\nto him and he kept on. Several arrows fell dangerously close and he\nmight have been hurt had not old Andy run after him and induced him to\ngo farther up the beach and out of harm's way.\n\n\"They will kill Washington!\" cried Jack as he thought of the colored man\nat the mercy of the savages.\n\n\"There he comes!\" yelled Mark.\n\nHe pointed toward the ship and as they all looked in that direction they\nsaw the colored man climbing out on the deck. Under one arm he bore a\nlong narrow box, and in the other hand he carried one of the electric\nguns.\n\n\"He's goin' to fight 'em!\" exclaimed Andy. \"He's got a gun and he will\nshow 'em what's what!\"\n\nBut Washington did not seem to have any such intentions. With a yell\nthat equalled the savage cries of the natives, he sprang over the side\nof the ship, onto the sand and ran toward the group of adventurers. A\nflight of arrows followed him, but he was not hit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nON LAND\n\n\n\"Why don't he shoot his gun at 'em?\" demanded Andy, capering about on\nthe sand. \"He could soon scare 'em off!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid Washington is too frightened to do anything like that,\"\nanswered Professor Henderson. \"He is lucky to have escaped alive.\"\n\n\"Wait until he gets here with that gun, an' I'll do some huntin' that\nwill make them savages skip!\" exclaimed Andy.\n\nIn a little while Washington came up to where the others from the\n_Porpoise_ stood on the beach. The colored man was panting from his run.\n\n\"De most monstrous disproportionately extradition ob circumstantial\noccurrances dat ever transpositioned on my optical vasionariness!\" he\nexclaimed as he laid his gun and the black box carefully down on the\nsand. \"Ten thousand naked imps of darkness swarmin' ober de ship an' not\na pusson to say what dey ought to do an' where dey ought t' go! It am\nsuttinly terrible!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you shoot some of 'em?\" demanded Andy.\n\n\"Me?\" exclaimed Washington. \"What for I want t' shoot 'em? S'pose I want\n'em t' git mad at me?\"\n\n\"Well, you're a great one,\" went on Andy, picking up the gun. \"I guess\nI'll have to take a few shots myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, sah.\"\n\nFrom Washington the adventurers learned how the savages had silently\ncome up in their canoes and surrounded the ship, gaining possession of\nit before he could make any effort at defense, even had he so desired.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" asked Mrs. Johnson, when they had retreated out\nof sight of the savages. \"The natives have possession of the boat, and\nhow are we to regain her when there are so many of them?\"\n\n\"It certainly is a hard nut to crack,\" admitted the professor. \"We will\nhave to camp out on the beach for a while and see what happens. Perhaps\nthey may leave the vessel when they find it will do them no good. They\ncan't run her.\"\n\n\"But they can tear her all apart and damage the machinery,\" said Jack.\n\"Then we would be in a pickle.\"\n\n\"Well, we won't hope for any such bad luck as that,\" interrupted the\nprofessor. \"We will look for the best.\"\n\n\"When are we going to have breakfast?\" asked the little girl, after a\nlong wait. \"I'm hungry, mother.\"\n\n\"We will have it pretty soon,\" replied Mrs. Johnson in order to quiet\nher daughter's mind.\n\n\"But I want it now,\" continued Nellie. \"I'm very hungry.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Mrs. Johnson.\n\n\"An' I had de finest brekfust what was ever invented,\" said Washington,\nrolling his big eyes. \"Mud turkle eggs, ham, preserves, coffee--\"\n\n\"That will do, Washington,\" said the professor. \"It only makes our\nmouths water to think about such things.\"\n\nAt the mention of the turtle eggs Jack nudged Mark, and signalled him to\nwalk to one side. When they were out of earshot of the others Jack said:\n\n\"What's the matter with cooking some of the eggs that are left on the\nsand? There are plenty of them, and there is no sense in our going\nhungry.\"\n\n\"How you going to cook 'em?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I'll show you,\" replied Jack.\n\nHe scooped a hollow place out in the sand until he had quite a hole.\nThis he banked up with stones until he had a small oven. By arching the\nstones over toward the top there was left a sort of circular opening.\nOver this Jack fitted a monster clam shell, with the concave side\nuppermost.\n\nThis made an improvised stew pan. Underneath was piled small bits of dry\ndrift-wood, which a match soon set on fire. In a little while the water\nin the big shell was boiling.\n\n\"Now get some other shells for dishes,\" said Jack to Mark.\n\nSoon Mark had piled up a lot of smaller shells.\n\n\"Help me gather some eggs now,\" said Jack, \"and we'll put them in to\nboil. Then we'll invite the rest of the folks to breakfast.\"\n\nThe two boys soon uncovered from the sand a pile of the eggs, and in a\nlittle while they were steaming in the hot water. Then Jack arranged the\nshell-dishes on the sand. He went over to where the others were gloomily\nconsidering their plight.\n\n\"Breakfast is ready,\" he announced.\n\n\"This isn't any time for joking,\" spoke Professor Henderson, rather\nsternly.\n\n\"But I mean it,\" went on Jack. \"Just come over and see. I'm not fooling\nyou.\"\n\nWondering what he had done they all followed him.\n\n\"Welcome to Hotel Terra del Fuego!\" cried Mark. \"We haven't much of a\nvariety, but what there is we can recommend.\"\n\nHe began to dip the eggs out of the water with a bit of shell and placed\nthem on the improvised dishes.\n\n\"Everyone sit down,\" commanded Jack. \"The bill of fare is ready.\"\n\nThey all joined in the short laugh that followed, and soon were seated\nin a circle about the beach-oven. The eggs proved to be very good, even\nthough there was no pepper. The salt of the sea water they were boiled\nin was more than sufficient.\n\n\"Now if there was only bread in that ammunition bag Washington brought\nwith the gun,\" said Andy, \"we wouldn't want a better meal.\"\n\n\"He'p yo'se'f!\" exclaimed the colored man with a grin as he extended a\ncanvas bag that was tied to the stock of the electric gun.\n\nThe old hunter opened it and found it filled with ship biscuits.\n\n\"Well I am stumped!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I grabbed up de wrong thing in my haste,\" Washington explained. \"I\nthought I had de electrical lightning bullets, but I didn't. Howsomever\nde gun's got some in de chamber.\"\n\n\"It's a lucky mistake,\" commented the professor as he munched a biscuit\nand an egg. \"Bullets are good but these are better, when one is\nhungry.\"\n\nThey managed to make a fairly good meal, so that even hungry Nellie was\nsatisfied. The boys found a spring of fresh water up on shore, and this\nfurnished something to drink, for which they were grateful.\n\nThey sat about on the beach, after the breakfast and discussed what they\nhad better do. It was evident that an attempt to regain possession of\nthe ship, with their small force and only one weapon, was out of the\nquestion.\n\n\"We've got to use strategy,\" said Andy. \"If we could play some trick on\nthe savages we might scare them away. Otherwise I don't see what we are\nto do.\"\n\n\"It's a bad state of affairs,\" replied professor Henderson. \"Even if we\ngot the ship we might find it so badly damaged that it would be\nimpossible to run it. It is a terrible thing,\" and he heaved a deep\nsigh.\n\nThe hours passed with no change in the situation. The savages remained\nin possession of the submarine, and did not seem inclined to quit the\nvessel. Most of them were inside, but quite a number paddled about the\nstranded craft in their canoes.\n\nThere was nothing for the adventurers to do but to await developments.\nWith no chance of attacking the force of natives, they might consider\nthemselves lucky if the savages did not come ashore to give battle.\n\nThe sun was high in the heavens when, in the shade of a big tree where\nthey had all taken refuge from the heat, Nellie again announced that she\nwas hungry.\n\n\"I guess the boys will have to provide another meal,\" said Mr.\nHenderson.\n\nJack and Mark said they guessed they could find some more turtle eggs,\nand Washington volunteered to accompany them. As they were looking for a\nnest in the sand they saw one of the tortoises scurrying down to the\nocean.\n\n\"Git her, quick!\" cried the colored man. \"Turn her ober on her back!\"\n\nThe boys did so, though they did not know what Washington's object was.\nThe big animal lay bottom side up, vainly moving its flippers. In a few\nminutes Washington had killed the turtle and cut it out of the shell.\n\n\"Now we'll hab turtle soup!\" he exclaimed.\n\nSoon the fire was again blazing in the improvised stove, and a little\nlater an appetizing smell filled the air. Washington had made the soup,\nand, in addition, had cooked a number of the turtle eggs.\n\nBig clam shells again served for dishes and a better meal than the\nbreakfast was served.\n\n\"Now if we only had some dessert,\" spoke Mr. Henderson in a joking\ntone, \"we wouldn't want much more. But I suppose dessert is out of the\nquestion.\"\n\nJack and Mark looked at each other and, without a word went off toward\nthe woods. In a little while they came back, their arms filled with\ncocoanuts.\n\n\"How will these do for dessert?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Fine!\" cried Mr. Henderson.\n\nThe fruit was broken open with stones and the delicious milk and soft\npulp eaten with much relish. Then the adventurers stretched out beneath\nthe trees and rested. The thoughts of each one were busy with plans for\nrecovering the submarine, though no one seemed to be able to suggest any\nthing.\n\nIt was getting dusk, when, somewhat discouraged over the result of the\nvisit of the savages, they were all seated on the beach. They were\nbeginning to think again of something to eat when Andy Sudds, discovered\nthe long black box which Washington had brought with him in his flight\nfrom the _Porpoise_, and dropped in a hollow.\n\n\"I suppose you've got something very fine in there, Washington?\"\n\n\"I declare to goodness I don't know what dat air contraption am\nconglomerated with,\" said the colored man. \"I jest grabbed it up and\nrun.\"\n\nThe old hunter had, in the meanwhile, taken the cover off.\n\n\"What in the world have we struck,\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Sky rockets!\" cried Jack, with a glance at the contents of the box.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Professor Henderson. \"I took some aboard in case we might\nhave to signal for help on the water.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" yelled Andy.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"We'll use the sky rockets as weapons against the natives!\" shouted the\nold hunter, capering about on the sand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nREGAINING THE SHIP\n\n\nAt first the others did not know what he meant. Andy seemed much\nexcited, and for a time the professor thought the heat and worry might\nhave affected the hunter's mind.\n\n\"We'll show 'em a thing or two!\" cried Andy. \"I once scared a lot of\nIndians this way so they didn't know whether they were on their head or\ntheir feet. Hurrah!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked Mr. Henderson. \"Hadn't you better\nsit down and rest a bit?\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" replied Andy. \"I'm talking about those sky rockets.\nThey'll be better than bullets. You see,\" he went on, \"after it gets\ndark we'll shoot the rockets over the ship. The savages will think they\nare in the midst of a lot of falling stars, and if they don't take to\ntheir boats and leave us the ship I'll miss my guess, that's all.\"\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed the inventor. \"We'll try it.\"\n\nThe rockets were taken out and examined. They were big affairs of\nseveral pound weight and were intended for far-off signalling at sea.\n\nAndy, with the aid of the boys, Tom and Bill, soon constructed a rough\nsort of support from which to set off the fire-works. As soon as it grew\ndark, which it did about seven o'clock, preparations were made to try\nthe experiment.\n\nWith a whizz and roar the first rocket went sailing skyward. Up through\nthe black night it went, trailing behind it a shower of fire and sparks.\nThen, with a loud report like that of a gun it burst directly over the\nship and a rain of brilliantly colored globes of flame descended.\n\n\"Shot number one!\" cried Andy, who was setting off the rockets.\n\nFor a few seconds after the first flight there came no sound from the\nnatives at the ship. Then, just as the second rocket was set off there\nissued a long-drawn howl, which was succeeded by cries of fear.\n\n\"We've waked 'em up!\" shouted Jack.\n\nIn rapid succession several more rockets were sent over the _Porpoise_.\nBy the light of them could be seen a mass of natives crowded out on the\nsmall deck, while others were in their canoes.\n\n\"I think I'll try it a little lower this time,\" remarked Andy. \"Maybe I\ncan hit some of 'em!\"\n\nHe slanted the support closer to the ground and set off two rockets at\nonce. Straight across the sandy beach they flew, directly toward the\ncrowd of natives on the ship. Right into the midst of the savages the\ntrailing comet of fire shot, with a hiss, roar and sputter that was\nenough to strike terror into the bravest heart.\n\nThere was a long piercing howl of fear. Then, as the natives felt the\nhot sparks scatter over their half-naked bodies, they broke into a wild\nstampede. Over the side of the ship they plunged, into the sea, and swam\noff. Those in boats paddled quickly away.\n\nFor good measure Andy sent another rocket into the midst of the fleeing\nones, and this served to quicken their departure. By the light of the\nlast one it could be seen that the ship was deserted, though the water\nall about her was black with the swimming savages, and the canoes.\n\n\"I guess they won't come back in a hurry!\" cried Andy. \"Come on! We'll\nboard the ship now, and get the electric guns to ward off any further\nattacks!\"\n\n\"That's the talk!\" cried Mark.\n\nToward the _Porpoise_ all started on a run. As they neared her they\nfound that the rising tide had floated her.\n\n\"We must see if the natives damaged her,\" spoke Mr. Henderson as soon as\nhe set foot on deck. \"If they have it will be a hard matter to make\nrepairs so far from civilization.\"\n\nA hasty examination, however, showed that the savages had disturbed\nlittle. The engine was soon set in motion, and, in ten minutes the ship\nwas steaming away from the coast, headed toward the south, the goal they\nwere so eagerly seeking.\n\nAs soon as they were well out to sea, and all sight of the canoes of the\nsavages had been lost, supper was served, and all brought good appetites\nto the table. For, though the improvised meals on shore had tasted good,\nthere had not been much to them.\n\nFor several days the _Porpoise_ was kept on her course, sailing along\nunder the water by day, and upon the surface at night. It was one\npleasant afternoon, while Nellie, Jack and Mark were sitting out on the\ndeck, during one of the times when the boat had risen to the surface to\nrenew the air supply, that a strange commotion was observed off their\nlee. The ocean seemed to be boiling.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the little girl.\n\nThe two boys looked to where she pointed. Indeed the ocean seemed to be\nbubbling up and down in a strange manner.\n\n\"It's a school of porpoises,\" said Jack.\n\nJust then the water became alive with big fish. They leaped over each\nother, springing high into the air and falling back into the sea with\nresounding splashes.\n\n\"They're not porpoises! They're whales! Baby whales!\" yelled Mark. \"Look\nout or some of the big ones may ram the boat!\"\n\nAs he spoke the water all about the submarine was seen to be fairly\nswarming with the small whales. There were scores of them, and, at\ntimes, they were so thick that it appeared possible to walk out upon\nthem without getting very deep into the water.\n\nSuddenly the ship careened to one side and the sea rushed over the deck.\nIt was evident that one of the big whales, which were deeper down in the\nwater, had struck the vessel.\n\nNellie screamed and tried to grab the hand rail that was about the\nplatform. She missed her grip. The next instant she was floundering in\nthe ocean, in the midst of the school of whales.\n\n\"Man overboard!\" yelled Jack, remembering vaguely that he had read this\nwas the proper call to make in case of accident.\n\nHis cry brought Washington and the professor up the companionway on the\njump.\n\n\"Launch the boat!\" cried the inventor as he saw what had happened.\n\nMark was already in action. At the first sight of Nellie slipping over\nthe side he had thrown off his coat, broken the laces of his shoes in\norder the more quickly to remove the foot coverings, and had dived into\nthe swirling water which surrounded the submarine.\n\nHe struck out in the direction where the little girl had disappeared,\nand as her golden head appeared above the mass of foam he yelled in\nencouragement.\n\nBy this time the small boat was launched and the colored man and Jack\nwere pulling toward him. Mark succeeded in reaching Nellie as she was\ngoing down the second time. He grabbed her long locks and managed to\nkeep her up until the little craft was alongside of him.\n\n\"Git in quick, 'fore dem whales eat yo' up!\" cried Washington.\n\nHe hauled the unconscious child in first, and then Jack gave Mark a\nhand. As if by magic all the whales had disappeared and the sea was\nquiet again. In a few minutes the rescuers and the rescued one went back\nagain on the _Porpoise_, where Professor Henderson soon brought Nellie\naround again. Beyond the shock and wetting neither she nor Mark was\nharmed.\n\nIt was Jack's watch on deck that night. He had the tour from eight until\ntwelve o'clock and when, about ten, every one but himself had retired,\nhe took his position in the door of the conning tower and prepared to\npass the time as best he could.\n\nThe ship was moving along at half speed, and, as the automatic steering\nattachment was working Jack had little to do. He sat looking at the\nstars that twinkled in the sky, the blazing Southern Cross showing among\nthe constellations, when he heard a slight noise near the companionway.\n\nHe looked in that direction and, to his horror, he saw the ghostly white\nshape that had, on previous occasions, caused him and the others fright.\n\nAt first the boy resolved to shut himself up in the tower and wait until\nthe uncanny thing had disappeared. Then his courage came back and he\nthought he would try to solve the mystery.\n\nHe argued that if the weird white object was human and could witness his\nmovements the best thing to do would be to try and creep upon it\nunobserved. On the contrary, if the ghost was some natural phenomenon,\nor a supernatural agent, all he could do would be of no avail.\n\nSo he decided the best thing to do would be to crawl upon the thing,\nkeeping as near to the deck as possible and trying to hide himself. With\nthis in view he put on a long rain coat that hung in the conning tower,\nand then, like a snake, commenced to wiggle his way toward the middle of\nthe platform where the white object still stood.\n\nNearer and nearer to it Jack came. His heart was beating fast and he was\nmuch frightened, but he nerved himself to continue. As he came closer he\ncould see that the object looked more and more like a man, completely\nrobed in white garments.\n\nJack was now within ten feet of the strange object. It was a man, he was\nsure of it, but whether a present or former inhabitant of the earth he\ncould not decide. Jack's hair was beginning to raise. A cold shiver ran\ndown his spine as the white thing lifted an arm and seemed to point\ndirectly at him. At the same time it groaned in a deep tone.\n\nJack let out a yell that could be heard all over the ship. He made a\nspring for the object, determined to discover what it was or die.\n\nAt that instant the whole ship seemed to rise in the air. It left the\nwater and began moving skyward. Right out of the waves the _Porpoise_\nwas lifted until the big screw was clear of the water and it was\nchurning around in the tunnel without any resistance, racing at top\nspeed now that it had no water to thrust against.\n\nThen the ghost seemed to vanish into thin air, and Jack felt himself\nfalling down the hatchway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nON A VOLCANIC ISLAND\n\n\nIn an instant the ship was in confusion. The professor, followed by old\nAndy, Washington, Mark, Bill and Tom, came rushing from their berths,\nall in their night clothing, to see what the trouble was. They met in a\ntangled mass, stumbling over Jack at the foot of the steps.\n\n\"Is the ship on fire?\" called Mrs. Johnson from her cabin.\n\n\"I hope not!\" called the professor. \"But something has happened. Don't\nbe frightened!\"\n\nBy this time Jack, who had been somewhat stunned, recovered his senses\nand worked his way out of the mass of bodies.\n\n\"The ghost! The ghost!\" he cried. \"I saw him again!\"\n\n\"Land a' massy!\" yelled Washington.\n\n\"What has happened to the ship?\" cried the professor. \"Is it a tidal\nwave?\"\n\n\"I was on deck,\" panted Jack. \"I saw the white thing! I crept up on it!\nAll at once the ship rose in the air!\"\n\n\"And it's still rising!\" shouted the inventor. \"I must see what this\nmeans!\"\n\nHe made his way to the deck, and his loud shout soon brought the others\nup to him.\n\n\"Shut off the engine!\" Mr. Henderson called down to Washington, who\nhurried to obey.\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked Andy, rushing towards him.\n\n\"We have run upon an island,\" answered the professor. \"This is the worst\nthing that has yet happened to us.\"\n\n\"What sort of an island is it that shoots you up in the air?\" asked the\nold hunter.\n\n\"It's hard to say,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"We will have to wait until\nmorning to find out.\"\n\nThe boys and men went up on deck and there beheld a curious sight. The\n_Porpoise_ had been lifted bodily from the surface of the ocean where\nshe had been sailing and was now raised about ten feet above the crest\nof the billows. It was too dark to see the extent of the island she\nrested on, but, from the circle of foam around the outer edge it did not\nappear to be very big.\n\nThe excitement occasioned by the appearance of the ghost, Jack's yells\nand fall, and the rising of the ship, had subsided somewhat. Mrs.\nJohnson and her daughter, who were much frightened, were assured there\nwas no immediate danger, and the men and boys put on more substantial\nclothing than that of their night robes.\n\nIt seemed as if morning would never come, but at length there was a pale\nlight in the east and soon it changed to a rosy glow, showing that the\nsun was coming.\n\nThe professor was early on deck, and Mark and Jack were not far behind.\nAs soon as it was light enough they could see that the ship was held\nfast on top of a small rocky isle, about one hundred feet in diameter,\nwhich rose abruptly from the water.\n\n\"It's a volcanic island,\" decided the professor. \"We are in the midst of\nsubterranean disturbances and this is probably one of the effects of\nsome under-sea eruption. The pinnacle of rock rose from the ocean,\nforced up by some power underneath, just as our ship came over it. That\naccounts for the sudden rising into the air of the _Porpoise_. No wonder\nwe were all scared.\"\n\n\"The next question,\" began old Andy, \"is how are we to get off?\"\n\n\"That's the point,\" agreed Mr. Henderson. \"Here we are, high and dry,\nand we might as well be a broken flying machine as a submarine for all\nthe power we have.\"\n\n\"Will we have to stay here forever?\" asked Nellie, who had come up on\ndeck.\n\n\"I hope not,\" answered the professor, smiling for the first time since\nthe accident. \"We will find a way to get down, never fear, little girl.\"\n\n\"I suppose we might dig some sort of a canal down to the water,\"\nremarked Jack. \"If we could we might float the ship.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you'd find it slow digging through this volcanic rock,\"\nanswered Andy. \"It's like flint.\"\n\n\"Well, there's no use worrying over it,\" went on the professor in as\ncalm a tone as he could muster. \"It's time for breakfast, and we have to\neat whether we're on the top of an island that shoots out of the water\nwhen you least expect it, or sailing along as we ought to.\"\n\nAccordingly Washington prepared the morning meal, and they all found\nthey had appetites for it, in spite of their fright. Afterward they all\ncame on deck again and looked about them.\n\nThey were in the midst of a wild waste of water. Not a sign of land\ncould be seen in any direction, and there was no evidence of a sail or\nsteamship as far as the horizon showed.\n\nThe little island which held the _Porpoise_ so close a prisoner was a\nmere speck in the vast ocean, but it was large enough to put an end,\ntemporarily at least, to the progress of the powerful submarine.\n\nThe professor and the boys went over the side and climbed down to the\nrock. Then the inventor verified his surmise that the rocky point was of\nvolcanic origin. It was also seen that there was little chance to get\nthe craft back into the ocean.\n\n\"I guess we're doomed to stick here for some time,\" remarked Mr.\nHenderson, with a grim smile. \"The rock has caught us squarely and\nnothing short of dynamite will free us. To use the explosive might mean\nthe destruction of the ship, and I dare not risk it.\"\n\nGloom settled over the party in spite of the efforts the professor made\nto be cheerful. Washington, after the first few minutes of fright,\nregained his usual good spirits, but, no matter how he laughed and\njoked, there was a feeling of terror in every heart.\n\nThey realized their helplessness, and knew that unless another upheaval\nof nature occurred there was small likelihood of their release.\n\nOn the third day of their strange adventure Professor Henderson resolved\non a bold step.\n\n\"We must use dynamite,\" he declared. \"If we stay here on this desolate\nrock we are bound to perish sooner or later, for our food cannot last\nmany months, though we have a large supply. We are out of the path of\nsteamers and only by chance would one pass here. With care we may be\nable to blast the rock so that the ship will not be permanently\ndamaged. What do you all say? I would like your advice, for this\nconcerns all of us.\"\n\nOne after the other all said they were willing to abide by whatever the\ninventor did. Accordingly he made his preparations. Washington, with a\nhammer and chisel, was set to cutting a fair sized hole in the big rock,\nas far away from the ship as possible.\n\nHe was two days at the job, and, during this time those on the stranded\n_Porpoise_ watched in vain for the sight of a vessel.\n\n\"I am going to put the dynamite in,\" announced Mr. Henderson one\nmorning. \"We must all get into the small boat and row some distance\naway, as there is no telling what the result of the explosion may be.\"\n\n\"Suppose the submarine is destroyed?\" asked Mrs. Johnson.\n\n\"Then we will have to sail for the nearest land in the small boat,\"\nreplied the captain. \"I will provision it and we will take all the\nprecautions we can.\"\n\nIt was with anxious hearts that the little party embarked in the little\ncraft that was carried on the _Porpoise_. It was barely large enough to\nhold them. The professor was the last in, and he lighted a long fuse\nthat led to the dynamite before taking his seat. Then with Tom and Bill\nat the oars the little craft moved away.\n\n\"How long before the explosion will take place?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I timed the fuse for ten minutes,\" answered Mr. Henderson. \"That will\nenable us to get far enough away so we will not be swamped by a wave.\"\n\nFive minutes later Mark, who was intently watching the volcanic rock,\ngave a loud cry.\n\n\"There she goes!\" he shouted.\n\nThey all looked to behold a wonderful thing. As easily as though it was\nsome conjuring trick the rock began to settle down in the water. Lower\nand lower it went until only the tallest jagged points showed above the\nwaves, whose crested tops the keel of the ship now almost touched.\n\n\"That isn't the explosion!\" exclaimed the professor. \"The fuse has not\nhad time to get to the powder yet.\"\n\n\"But the rock is disappearing!\" yelled Andy.\n\nAs he spoke the big pile of volcanic stone vanished completely and the\n_Porpoise_ floated easily on the surface of the sea.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"It am de most kloslostrous occurranceness dat eber transpositioned\nitself!\" exploded Washington.\n\n\"Let's row back to the ship now!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"Not yet!\" said the professor quickly. \"The dynamite has not gone off\nyet.\"\n\n\"There it goes now,\" remarked Jack.\n\nAt that instant a big column of water shot upward and a dull rumbling\ncould be heard. A few seconds later the little boat rocked violently\nfrom the effects of the waves. Then the sea became calm, and the\n_Porpoise_ could be seen dancing up and down on the heaving billows.\n\n\"Now we can go back in safety,\" spoke Mr. Henderson, and Tom and Bill\nbent to the oars.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Mrs. Johnson. \"The rock seemed to disappear\nbefore the explosion occurred.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what it was,\" explained the inventor. \"By some strange\nfreak of nature the volcanic mass dropped back into the ocean a little\nbefore I was ready to blow it to pieces. In settling down it lowered the\nship. Then the explosion occurred beneath the waves. If I had waited a\nlittle while I need not have risked the dynamite.\"\n\n\"Well, there was no guarantee that the rock would go back where it came\nfrom,\" remarked Jack.\n\n\"No, we had to act,\" agreed the professor. \"But now let us go aboard.\"\n\nThey rowed back to the _Porpoise_, which they found had sustained no\ndamage from the queer experience it had been through.\n\nThe motors were set in motion and in a little while the craft was again\nmoving through the water out of the dangerous vicinity of the volcanic\narea.\n\n\"Who has the two watches to-night?\" asked Mr. Henderson after supper had\nbeen served.\n\n\"Washington and Andy,\" answered Jack, who kept track of the matter.\n\n\"I guess we'll change it, and have you and Mark take them,\" went on the\ncaptain. He gave Jack a peculiar look, and made a sign to him not to say\nanything. Wondering what was to come Jack went up on deck to watch the\nsunset.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nCAUGHT IN A WHIRLPOOL\n\n\nThe boy was joined a little later by the captain, who, coming close to\nhim whispered:\n\n\"I am going to try to discover the ghost to-night. That is why I wanted\nyou boys on hand to help me. This thing must be stopped if it is a joke,\nand, if it isn't--\"\n\n\"Do you think it is some one playing tricks?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" answered Mr. Henderson. \"We will see what\nhappens to-night.\"\n\nMark came on deck a little while, and the three talked of the strange\nappearances of the mysterious white object. The boys told of their\nexperiences, and Jack related more fully his on the night the ship went\nup on the big rock upheaval.\n\n\"I don't believe in ghosts,\" said Mr. Henderson, \"I'm going to lay this\none,\" and he smiled grimly.\n\nNight settled down. Jack, who had the first tour under the new\narrangement, had made himself comfortable in the conning tower, and Mr.\nHenderson had hidden himself in the companionway. His idea was to thus\nguard both openings into the ship and ascertain whether the ghost came\nfrom within or without the craft.\n\nUp to a short time before twelve o'clock nothing out of the ordinary\nhappened. The only sound was the lapping of the waves on the steel sides\nof the _Porpoise_, and now and then a splash as a big fish leaped out of\nthe water. There was only the slightest breeze.\n\nJack who, somehow or other, felt much sleepier than usual, caught\nhimself nodding several times. Once he awoke with a start and realized\nthat he had been dozing.\n\n\"Come, come,\" he remarked to himself, \"this will not do at all. This is\na fine way to watch for a ghost.\"\n\nHe remained wide awake for perhaps five minutes. Then he was off to the\nland of nod again. He was just dreaming that he was skating on a pond\nand was playing snap the whip with a lot of boys, when he awoke with a\nstart.\n\nHe felt something pressing on his chest and to his horror, as he looked\nup, he saw a big towering white object standing over him. A second\nglance showed him it was a man, or the semblance of one, and the thing's\nfoot was on his chest.\n\nWith a terrified scream Jack sprang up, upsetting the ghost, which, the\nboy thought at the time, seemed rather heavy for an unearthly spirit.\n\n\"Did you catch it?\" cried the professor.\n\n\"No! Yes! I don't know!\" yelled Jack, struggling to his feet in time to\nsee the white object glide down the stairs that led from the conning\ntower into the forward cabin.\n\n\"Run after it! We must solve the mystery!\" cried Mr. Henderson springing\nfrom the companionway up on deck.\n\nBut at that moment the ship began to whirl about in a circle slowly at\nfirst, but with increasing speed until Jack and the professor felt sick\nand dizzy. All about the water seemed to be bubbling and boiling, while,\nat the same time, there arose on the air a mournful howl.\n\nThe professor jumped to the rail and looked over the side. What he saw\nmade him recoil with horror.\n\n\"Quick! Close the man-hole hatch!\" he cried. \"Shut the door of the\nconning tower!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Jack managed to ask.\n\n\"We are caught in a whirlpool!\" Mr. Henderson yelled as he leaped down\nthe companionway and pulled the heavy steel cover after him.\n\nStricken with a nameless dread, Jack closed the water-tight door of the\nconning tower and made his way to the cabin. He could hardly get down\nthe stairs, so swiftly was the ship whirling about.\n\nHe found the captain busy in the engine room and, in response to calls,\nWashington and Mark came hurrying in. They had been awakened by the\ncommotion and the strange movements of the _Porpoise_.\n\n\"Turn on all the lights,\" ordered the inventor. \"We must prepare for the\nworst.\"\n\nThe incandescents were soon glowing and in the glare the frightened\nadventurers gathered about Mr. Henderson, wondering what new terror had\nbefallen them.\n\n\"See!\" exclaimed the inventor. \"We are going comparatively slow now, but\nwe are on the outer edge. Wait until we reach the centre.\"\n\nHe pointed to a compass and, as the needle pointed steadily to the north\nthe card seemed to be going around like the hands of a clock that has\nlost the balance and escapement wheels. The ship made three complete\ncircles a minute.\n\nPale and frightened, Mrs. Johnson came from her cabin, whence the\nterrified cries of Nellie could be heard.\n\n\"Are we sinking?\" she asked.\n\n\"Sinking will never harm the _Porpoise_,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"This\nis something decidedly worse.\"\n\n\"I know! It is a whirlpool!\" exclaimed the lady.\n\n\"I'm dizzy; I'm so dizzy!\" wailed Nellie. \"Please stop the ship from\ngoing round, Mr. Henderson.\"\n\nShe came from her bed crying, and all her mother could do did not quiet\nher.\n\nMeanwhile the submarine continued to whirl about faster and faster in\nthe swirling waters. Five times each minute now it made the circuit,\nand, like the coils of a boa constrictor that is enfolding its victim,\nthe circles continually grew smaller.\n\n\"We are being sucked down,\" said Jack in a low tone as he glanced at the\ndepth gage, and noted that it showed them to be thirty feet under water.\n\n\"That is so,\" remarked Mr. Henderson quietly.\n\n\"What will be the result?\" asked Mrs. Johnson.\n\n\"I do not know,\" was the answer, and the captain turned aside. He seemed\nto have lost all courage in the face of the new disaster.\n\n\"Can't we empty the tanks and rise to the surface?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"The tanks are not filled,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"What is taking us\ndown is the force of the whirlpool and not the weight of water.\"\n\n\"Then you fear for the worst?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"I do,\" said the captain simply.\n\n\"Don't give up the ship!\" exclaimed the old hunter suddenly. \"Never say\ndie! It's a long lane that has no turns! Hip! Hip! Hurrah!\"\n\nThey all turned to stare at the old man.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Mr. Henderson in a soothing tone, that one would use\ntoward a baby, or a person not right in their head. \"Never mind. We may\nbe saved.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm not crazy!\" exclaimed Andy. He tried to caper about but the\nmotion of the ship made him dizzy and he had to sit down. \"I'm all\nright! I just happened to think of something!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the captain eagerly.\n\n\"Send the ship ahead!\" exclaimed Andy. \"Speed her as fast as she will\ngo. Try her strength against the force of the whirlpool! We may win!\"\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"I was too much depressed to think of\nthat! The ship has powerful engines. Queer you should remember that\ninstead of me. Come, Washington, start the screw going! We will try to\nbeat the whirlpool!\"\n\nThe submarine was now whirling around so rapidly that it was difficult\nfor any one to stand without leaning against the sides or holding on to\nsomething. It was going lower and lower down, as the gage showed.\n\nSoon a throb that was felt through the length of the craft told that the\nengine had started. The vibration increased until it seemed that the\nship would be torn apart. Never had the big screw revolved at greater\nspeed.\n\nFor a while the struggle between the force of man represented by the\nengine, and the power of nature, embodied in the whirlpool, seemed\nequal. Neither could gain the mastery. The ship continued to slide\naround in ever narrowing circles while the big cable of water, forced\nthrough the tunnel by the screw, was like a cataract.\n\n\"Which will win?\" asked the professor softly to himself.\n\nHe crawled to the gages and watched them. Only by their needles could it\nbe told when the battle had turned in favor of the adventurers.\n\nThe circular motion, that was now terrible in its speed and power,\nseemed to culminate in a rush that almost overturned the ship. In the\nengine room Washington was laboring to keep the machine at top speed. He\nput on the last ounce of power.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" yelled the professor suddenly. \"I think we shall win!\"\n\nHe pointed to the depth gage. The needle, which had showed a constantly\nincreasing record, until it was now at two hundred feet, had stopped. It\nshowed they were going no lower.\n\nThen Mr. Henderson looked at the indicator which showed the progress\nstraight ahead. The needle was beginning to tremble. As he watched he\nsaw it move, slowly at first, until, as the powerful screw won a victory\nover the terrible whirlpool. The gage marked one, two and then three\nmiles an hour.\n\n\"We are leaving the swirling waters!\" cried Mr. Henderson.\n\nThen, all at once, as though it was an arrow shot from a gigantic bow,\nthe _Porpoise_ cleft the under-billows and shot ahead, free at last from\nthe grip of the whirlpool.\n\nMan had triumphed over nature!\n\nOn rushed the ship like a race horse, for the engine was working as it\nnever had before, and it did not have the pool to contend against.\n\n\"Slow down,\" said Mr. Henderson, \"and we will go to the surface.\"\n\nTwo minutes later, under the buoyancy of her empty tanks, the _Porpoise_\nlay floating on the top of the waves, under the shining stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nUNDER FIRE\n\n\n\"I shouldn't want to go through that experience again,\" remarked Mr.\nHenderson, as he, with all of the ship's company except Mrs. Johnson and\nNellie went on deck. \"I thought we were lost, sure.\"\n\n\"Lucky our engine didn't go disproportionatin' herself at de mostess\ncriticless moment,\" put in Washington. \"Golly, but she suttinly did\nhum!\"\n\n\"And you deserve credit for making her do the humming,\" went on the\nprofessor with a smile.\n\n\"Well, we didn't catch the ghost,\" remarked Jack, \"though I certainly\nsaw him, it or her, whatever the thing is. I felt it too.\"\n\n\"It's rather strange,\" spoke the professor. \"Every time, or nearly every\ntime the ghost, as I suppose we must call it for the present, makes its\nappearance, something terrible happens to the ship. I hope it doesn't\nshow up too often.\"\n\nIt was three o'clock in the morning, and they had battled with the\nwhirlpool over two hours. They talked of little else, and each one told\nhow he or she felt.\n\n\"It was just like twisting yourself up tight in the swing, and then\nletting the rope unwind,\" said Nellie, and they all agreed that she had\ndescribed the sensation perfectly. They laughed, also, a thing they had\nfelt little like doing a short time previous.\n\nThe engine had run so hard, and some of the bearings had become so warm,\nthat for the rest of the night the professor decided to let the\nmachinery remain stationary. This would give it time to cool down he\nsaid, and they could make up the time lost the next day.\n\nTired out with the night's worry and labors they all slept late the next\nmorning, and it was nearly ten o'clock before breakfast was over. The\nship was started on her course once more, and Jack, who was steering,\nmade the engine hum as the submarine scudded along, submerged about\nfifty feet.\n\n\"When you have time I would like to talk to you,\" said Mrs. Johnson to\nCaptain Henderson.\n\n\"I'm at your service now,\" replied the inventor.\n\n\"What are you going to do with Nellie and me?\" the lady went on.\n\n\"Take you to the south pole with us,\" was the answer, with a smile.\n\n\"It's very kind of you, and I don't want to put you to any trouble,\"\nwent on Mrs. Johnson. \"But I would like to go back north.\"\n\n\"I'd like to oblige you,\" returned the inventor, \"but I hate to turn\nback now. We are well on our voyage, and I may never get another chance\nto locate the pole. Don't you want to accompany us? Think of the\nglorious achievement!\"\n\n\"I'd rather go back north,\" persisted the lady. \"But I wouldn't ask you\nto turn the ship around. What I was going to suggest was to sail along\non the surface for a few days and see if you cannot sight a homeward\nbound steamer or sailing vessel. Then you could put me and Nellie aboard\nher.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"I never thought of that. Though\nwe will be sorry to lose your company, and that of your little girl, I\nwill do anything to oblige you. We will at once go to the surface.\"\n\nHe called the necessary order to Jack through a speaking tube which led\nto the conning tower. In a few minutes the ship shot upward, and emerged\nfrom the ocean in a little shower of foam and spray.\n\nShe lay undulating on the surface, and was just beginning to move\nforward again, under the influence of the screw, when a dull boom echoed\noff to the left.\n\nJack looked from the observation windows in the conning tower and saw,\nabout a mile away a big steamer. From her side a white cloud of smoke\nfloated, and then the water splashed about fifty feet from the blunt\nnose of the submarine.\n\nOnce more came the boom, the white cloud of smoke and this time the\nwater splashed only twenty-five feet away from the bow of the\n_Porpoise_. A third time came the sound, and the splash was even nearer.\n\n\"They're firing on us!\" yelled Jack.\n\nAt his cry the professor ran on deck. He was just in time to see the\nfourth shot made, and this time the shell dropped into the water just\nastern of the _Porpoise_ and so close that when it exploded it sent a\nshower of spray all over the deck.\n\n\"Here! Stop that!\" yelled Mr. Henderson, shaking his fist in the\ndirection of the steamer. \"You nearly hit us that time. Do your\npracticing in some other direction!\"\n\n\"I don't think they can hear you,\" said Jack. \"And besides, I don't\nbelieve they are practicing.\"\n\n\"Then what in the world are they doing?\"\n\n\"Shooting at us I guess.\"\n\n\"Why do they want to shoot at us? We haven't done them any damage.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they think we are a torpedo boat,\" suggested Jack. \"Maybe that\nvessel's nation is at war with some other one and wants to sink us if\nit can.\"\n\n\"I believe you're right!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"But this will never\ndo. They must stop!\"\n\nOnce more the big gun on the ship was fired and the shell came\ndangerously close. At the same time several other reports, less in\nvolume were heard, and the water all about the submarine began to bubble\nas the missiles from the machine guns cut the waves.\n\n\"Maybe it's an English vessel sent to capture Mark and me because of\nthat anarchist trouble at the hotel,\" Jack went on.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed the captain. \"But whatever it is, we must stop it,\nor they will sink my ship. Wave your handkerchief, Jack.\"\n\nThe boy sprang to the top of the conning tower, in order to permit those\non the vessel to see him more plainly, and vigorously shook the white\nrag. That it was observed was evident when some one on the steamer\nwig-wagged back a reply. In a few minutes a boat was seen to put off\nfrom the ship, and soon a little launch, in command of a lieutenant in\nuniform, drew up alongside the _Porpoise_.\n\n\"Who is captain of this craft?\" asked the lieutenant as he came aboard.\n\n\"I am,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"What do you mean by firing on me?\"\n\n\"I am Lieutenant Muchmore,\" said the other, saluting. \"Captain Wackford,\nof the _Sylph_, in His Britannic Majesty's service, presents his\ncompliments, and asks you to pardon the occurrence. You see we took you\nfor a derelict and were trying to sink you.\"\n\n\"I thought perhaps war had broken out between some country and the\nUnited States since we left port,\" went on Mr. Henderson, \"and that you\nwere trying to make a capture.\"\n\n\"No, it was only that we thought you a waterlogged craft, and a danger\nto navigation,\" repeated the lieutenant. \"But what sort of a ship have\nyou?\"\n\n\"Come below and I'll show you the finest submarine that ever was built,\"\nanswered the inventor with pardonable pride. \"If you don't mind, give\nyour launch orders to go back to the ship, and I'll show something that\nwill make you open your eyes.\"\n\nAnxious to see what the strange little craft could do Lieutenant\nMuchmore sent his launch back, and went below with Captain Henderson. He\nwas astonished at what he saw, and unlike most Englishmen was willing to\nsay so.\n\nMr. Henderson then went to the conning tower. He directed the man-hole\ncover to be clamped on, and then filled the tanks. The ship sank fifty\nfeet below the surface and then shot forward.\n\nSeated in the cabin the lieutenant was observing with wonder showing on\nhis face at the accomplishment of sailing along under water. Suddenly\nthe lights were shut off, and the shutters moved back from the\nbull's-eye windows. The sea, glowing in the beams of the search light,\nwas alive with fish, large and small, beautiful and hideous.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the Englishman.\n\nThe bull's-eyes were closed, the lights switched on, and then, speeding\nthe engine almost to the top notch the captain steered the submarine\nstraight for the war-ship.\n\nHe had carefully noted her direction before starting his own craft, and\nhe resolved to do a little manoeuvering that would still further\nastonish the visitor. By careful reading of the different gages Mr.\nHenderson was able to come to the surface right in front of the _Sylph_,\nto the no small astonishment of the men on the deck of the vessel.\n\nThen, just to show what the _Porpoise_ could do, the inventor darted\naround the war-ship in a circle. He sunk below the surface, went under\nthe keel of the _Sylph_ and came up on the other side. Then he went the\nwhole length of her, under water, starting at the stern and ending at\nthe bow, where he brought the submarine to a rest in a smother of foam.\n\n\"Great! Wonderful! Surprising!\" were some of the adjectives Lieutenant\nMuchmore used as he stepped from the conning tower, with Captain\nHenderson, onto the deck.\n\nAt the appearance of the officer and the inventor a group of those on\nthe _Sylph_ gave three cheers for the little vessel.\n\n\"Is she for sale?\" asked Captain Wackford.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" replied Mr. Henderson with a laugh.\n\n\"Because if she is I'll give you free passage to England with her, on my\nship,\" went on the commander. \"My government would give a fortune for a\nboat that can do what yours does.\"\n\n\"It is not for sale,\" repeated Mr. Henderson, \"but I have some one on\nboard who would appreciate a free passage to England, or any northern\nport.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked Captain Wackford.\n\n\"A Mrs. Johnson and her daughter.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nCAUGHT IN AN ICE FLOE\n\n\nMr. Henderson soon explained the finding of the lady and the little\ngirl, and Captain Wackford readily agreed to give them passage to New\nYork, as the _Sylph_ was to call at that port.\n\nSo Nellie and her mother were put aboard the warship, after bidding\nfarewell to the captain and crew of the submarine. Mr. Henderson and the\nboys promised to write to them as soon as they got back from their\nvoyage to the south pole, and, amid a chorus of good-byes the _Porpoise_\nresumed her journey.\n\nFor several days the submarine forged to the south, and the weather\nbecame noticeably cooler. Some of the nights were chilly, and those on\nwatch were glad of the heavy coats they had brought along.\n\nOne morning, after a week of travel, when no interruptions had occurred\nby reason of accidents, old Andy came up on deck, and sniffing the air,\nsaid:\n\n\"We'll sight ice before night, or I'm a Dutchman.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I can smell it,\" replied the hunter, whereat Jack, and Mark who had\njoined him, laughed.\n\n\"That is no joke,\" put in Professor Henderson, who, coming up the\ncompanionway heard what was said. \"Old sea captains will tell you they\ncan smell an iceberg long before they can see it.\"\n\n\"I don't claim to be a sea captain,\" said Andy, \"but I once was on a\nwhaling voyage and I learned to sniff ice in the air. I saved the ship\nfrom collision with a berg once.\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" began the inventor as the adventurers sat about the supper\ntable after the meal was finished, \"who have the watches on deck\nto-night?\"\n\n\"Washington first and Bill second,\" replied Jack looking at the chart.\n\n\"Keep a sharp watch for the icebergs,\" advised the captain. \"If you feel\na sudden chill in the air, and see something white, stop the engine at\nonce and call for me.\"\n\nWhen the _Porpoise_ had been put in shape for the night, and the\ncompany, tired out from their labors over a general \"house cleaning\"\nwhich Captain Henderson had insisted on, went to bed, Washington took\nhis place in the conning tower.\n\nIt was quite cold, but as the temperature for several days past had been\nsteadily falling, nothing was thought of it.\n\n\"I guess I'll git out my fur-lined sealskin coat,\" said the colored man\nto himself as he felt the chill night air, that seemed to increase in\nfrigidity along about eleven o'clock. He went to the cabin to get his\novercoat, and, returning on deck prepared to spend the rest of his hour\nof watch in ease and comfort. He stretched out on the bench in the\nconning tower, noted that the machinery was working right and that the\nproper course was being steered, and then he let his thoughts drift to\nthe many adventures he and his employer had gone through of late, and\nalso while on the trip \"Through the Air to the North Pole.\"\n\nWashington gave one frightened, startled look, in a few minutes, so\ncomfortable had he fixed himself, but happening to look forward through\nthe glass-covered porthole of the tower, he saw something that made the\ncold chills run down his back.\n\nThere, right in front of the _Porpoise_, and not a cable-length away was\na tall, mysterious, white thing which was shimmering in the pale light\nof the moon that had lately risen.\n\nWashington gave one frightened, startled look, and then, with a tongue\nthat could hardly move, he yelled out:\n\n\"De ghost! De ghost! He'll git me suah!\"\n\nThen the colored man made a dive for the stairway leading to the cabin,\nbut missed it and brought up with a crash on the steel floor of the\nconning tower.\n\n\"What is it?\" called Professor Henderson, springing out of his bunk.\n\n\"De ghost!\" wailed Washington from the huddled up heap he was in.\n\n\"Catch him!\" yelled the captain.\n\n\"I dasn't,\" moaned Washington.\n\nThe next instant the ship quivered from stem to stern. There was a\nterrible shock, followed by a grinding, crashing sound. Then the craft\nseemed to be pressed down by some great weight. It heeled over to one\nside, and the water began to pour down the open man-hole.\n\n\"Quick! Clamp on the covers!\" shouted Mr. Henderson as he felt the sea\ndashing into the interior of the boat.\n\nJack and Mark sprang to obey. It took all their strength, for the water\nwas running in like a mill-race.\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked Andy, as he tried to climb up the\ncompanionway ladder, that was tilted backward.\n\n\"I guess we've hit your iceberg!\" cried Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I knew I smelled the frozen stuff,\" replied the old hunter.\n\nThey got the covers on the manhole only just in time and they all\ncrowded into the cabin, while Jack switched on the electric lights.\n\n\"Is the ship damaged?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I think not,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"But we are sinking. Look at the\ndepth gage.\"\n\nThe hand on the clock-face was moving slowly around. From ten it went to\ntwenty feet, then to thirty and kept going until it stood at seventy.\n\n\"Look to the air tanks,\" ordered Mr. Henderson to Washington, who, by\nthis time had recovered from his fright. \"See if they are all right.\"\n\nThe colored man came back in a few minutes and reported that the supply\nof compressed atmosphere was safe and that there was plenty of it.\n\n\"That's good,\" remarked Mr. Henderson. \"Whatever else happens we can\nbreathe for a while.\"\n\n\"But what has happened?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"I think the top part of an iceberg toppled down on us,\" was the reply.\n\"You know about nine-tenths of a berg is under water. Sometimes there is\na warm current of the ocean underneath the ice, and it melts. Then it\nbecomes top-heavy and tilts over. One of that sort must have caught us,\nand has shoved us down into the sea.\"\n\n\"But why don't we rise again when the ice floe slips off us?\" asked\nMark.\n\n\"Because, in all probability the ice will not slip off us,\" answered the\nprofessor grimly. \"It may be so large that it has caught us like a bug\nunder a barn door.\"\n\n\"Then we are fast in the ice under water,\" spoke Andy after a pause.\n\n\"It looks like it,\" came from the inventor. \"However we will not give up\nyet. We may be able to make our way out. Start the engine at full speed,\nWashington.\"\n\nThe machinery which the professor had shut down at the first cry of\nalarm was set going. Soon the throb and hum told that the big screw was\nrevolving.\n\nMeanwhile the _Porpoise_ had regained an even keel, and had stopped\nsinking, remaining at the depth of seventy feet below the surface.\n\n\"We will first try to go straight ahead,\" said the captain.\n\nHe turned on more power and they all waited in anxiety. The test would\ntell whether they could escape in that direction or not.\n\nBut, though the powerful screw churned the water to foam in the tunnel,\nthe _Porpoise_ never budged. It was as if she was held in a vice.\n\n\"It's of no use,\" remarked Mr. Henderson with a shake of his head as he\nwatched the speed gage and noted that it remained stationary. \"We must\nnow try the other way.\"\n\nOnce more the big screw was set going, this time in the opposite\ndirection, so as to pull the ship out of the ice if it was possible. But\nthis, too, was of no avail.\n\n\"It looks as if the ice had us,\" said Andy, trying to speak in a\ncheerful tone. \"But there's one way more to try.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"If we were in the air ship we could go up,\" replied the old hunter.\n\"But, as it is, we had better go down. Why don't you fill all the water\ntanks, and try to sink beneath the iceberg? It can't go down so very far\ninto the water, and I reckon we could slip under it.\"\n\n\"The very thing!\" exclaimed the professor, whose mind was too sorely\ntroubled over the happening to enable him to think of plans of escape.\n\"That's the best thing to do.\"\n\nUnder the inventor's direction Washington filled the tanks and then, ere\nthe pumps had ceased working, the screw was started and the deflecting\nrudder inclined to cause the ship to dive.\n\nOne, two, three minutes passed, and still the _Porpoise_ did not move\ntoward the bottom of the sea. She remained submerged and stationary.\nAnxious eyes gazed at the dials. The indicating hands trembled under the\nthrobbing of the engines, but did not move.\n\n\"It will not work!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson in sorrowful tones.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" asked Bill, who had come up to where the others\nstood.\n\n\"It means that we are prisoners in the ice; caught between the upper and\nlower parts of a gigantic berg, and held here under the water.\"\n\n\"Can't we ever get out?\" asked Jack, a tremor coming into his voice.\n\"Can't we escape when the ice melts?\"\n\n\"The ice of the southern polar sea seldom melts in this latitude,\"\nreplied the professor.\n\nAn ominous silence followed his words.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE SHIP GRAVEYARD\n\n\nTruly the adventurers were in a position that might well cause the\nstoutest heart to quail. With hundreds of tons of ice above, below, and\non every side of them, their chances of escaping alive from this frozen\ntomb were very small.\n\n\"Can't we make an attempt to get out of this prison?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Indeed we will,\" said the professor. \"We will try all the means at our\ncommand. If they all fail--\"\n\nHe dared not finish the sentence, but they all knew what he meant. It\nwas now about one o'clock in the morning. The ship had become stationary\nafter the uneasy motion caused by the oscillation of the big berg.\n\n\"We may as well turn in and get a little sleep,\" remarked Mr. Henderson.\n\"We can all work better if we get some rest.\"\n\nIt is doubtful whether any of them slept, for the horror of their\nposition was too fresh in their minds. Still, lying down in the bunks\nrested them.\n\nIt was six o'clock when Washington awoke. In spite of the dangers of the\nicy grave, he had managed to get a little sleep. He prepared breakfast\nand called the others.\n\n\"Make a good meal,\" advised Mr. Henderson. \"We have plenty of work ahead\nof us.\"\n\n\"Are you going to free the ship?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I am going to try,\" was the answer.\n\nA little later the inventor was busy in one of the small store rooms aft\nwhen Jack came up. The professor was carefully taking out a box\nlabelled:\n\n          DYNAMITE! DANGEROUS!\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"I am going to try the same experiment we attempted on the volcanic\nisland,\" was the reply. \"Only, this time, I am afraid we shall have to\ncomplete it to the end. There is little likelihood of the ice falling\napart.\"\n\n\"Then you are going to blow it up?\" went on Jack.\n\n\"That's what I hope to do,\" the inventor went on. \"I see no other way,\nand, though there is a risk, it is not so great a one as to wait to be\ncrushed in the ice as it freezes more solidly.\"\n\nUnder the directions of Mr. Henderson they got out the diving suits. The\nprofessor, the two boys and Andy put them on. The dynamite, in\nspecially prepared water-proof packages, with long fuses was laid in\nreadiness close to the door of the diving chamber.\n\nInto the cell, the four who were to make the perilous journey under the\nice, took their places. The water was slowly admitted, and then, with\nthe electric lights in their helmets throwing out powerful gleams, they\nstarted forward as the outer door swung open.\n\nIt was well they had all taken the precautions to don thick\nundergarments and clothing, for, even through the heavy rubber diving\nsuits, the terrible cold of the southern polar sea struck a chill to\ntheir very bones.\n\nAs the professor had said, the ship was caught between the upper and\nlower parts of the iceberg. On either side, ahead and to the rear there\nwas open water. Beneath their feet there was a floor of ice. It was as\nif they and the ship had been placed between two great sheets of the\nfrozen matter.\n\nTheir progress was slow, for the water hampered their movements and each\none had some of the dynamite to carry. The footing, too, was insecure,\nfor the icy bed of the ocean was slippery.\n\nAs they were huddled together, the professor in the lead, and their\nlamps making a faint illumination in the darkness, they suddenly became\naware of a great shadow over them. They looked up, and their hearts\nnearly ceased beating as they saw a gigantic sperm whale right over\nthem, and between the ice. The terrible animal had observed them also,\nand, food being scarce in those frigid regions, had evidently made up\nits mind to dine on some choice morsels.\n\nThe whale was nearly as large again as the submarine, and to the\nfrightened voyagers seemed more immense than a house. With slow motions\nof the flukes the animal placed itself right over the boys and men,\nready to rush at and take them into its terrible maw.\n\nOld Andy, who alone seemed to retain his presence of mind, stepped to\nthe front. The professor and the boys wondered what he was going to do.\nThen Andy held up one of the electric guns.\n\nAlways thinking of his chosen calling, the old hunter had picked up the\nweapon as he was leaving the _Porpoise_. He waited until the whale was\nwithin a short distance, so close in fact that the small eyes, out of\nall seeming proportion to the rest of the big body, could be seen. Then\nAndy fired one of the explosive bullets straight into the open mouth\nthat was fringed with rows of the springy bone that is a part of a\nwhale's eating apparatus.\n\nThe shot took effect, and made a vital wound. In its death struggles the\nbeast lashed the ocean to foam, and, but for the fact that Andy as soon\nas he fired the shot crouched down, pulling the others toward the floor\nof ice, they might all have been killed.\n\nThe whale turned and made a rush in the opposite direction to that of\nthe divers. This was a welcome sign to the professor, for he knew the\nanimal was seeking open water and this told him it must be somewhere in\nthe vicinity.\n\nTheir hearts still beating loudly from the closeness of death, the\nadventurers continued their way. On every side were fish, big and\nlittle, and, though some of the larger ones thrust themselves to the men\nand boys, as if wondering what strange creatures they were, none of them\noffered to attack.\n\nLed by the professor they made a complete circuit of the ship that was\nheld fast in the ice. As the inventor had surmised, the _Porpoise_ was\nnipped only above and below. If she could be freed at either of those\npoints she could rise to the surface, or sink down under the ice.\n\nAfter making a careful examination of the position of the craft, Mr.\nHenderson motioned to have the dynamite placed on the ice, in front of,\nand about two hundred feet away from the nose of the ship.\n\nHe connected the cartridges with the fuse and wires that were to explode\nthem, and then, taking the free end, he started back toward the ship.\nWashington was on the watch for them, and operated the diving chamber.\nSoon the four were back in the _Porpoise_.\n\n\"Now to see if our plan will work,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"I am relying on\nthe well known downward force of dynamite to blow a hole in the bottom\npart of the ice, so that we can drop below.\"\n\n\"Why not make a hole above so we can rise and escape?\" asked Bill.\n\n\"Because,\" replied the professor, \"we are now in the region of perpetual\nice. The ocean above us is one fast floe, or a number of smaller ones,\nso that, in any event our progress would be impossible. But we can sail\nfar enough down under water to escape all the ice. That is the purpose\nof the _Porpoise_. That is why I built her. We will now begin on the\nlast part of our voyage; that is if we can get free of the fearful grip\nof this sea of ice.\"\n\nThere was little they could do to protect themselves. They would either\nescape or be blown to pieces in case the explosive exerted too great a\nforce. They all put on life preservers to guard against the contingency\nof the _Porpoise_ being ripped apart and themselves cast into the water,\nyet they realized that without their ship, they could live but a little\nwhile in the ice-filled water near the south pole.\n\nThe professor saw that everything was in readiness. He hesitated a\nmoment and looked at the electric button in his hand, for this time the\ndynamite was to be detonated by a battery. How much might depend on one\npush of the finger!\n\nThere was a slight movement to the muscles of the professor's hand. Then\nit seemed as if a thunderbolt had fallen into the midst of the ocean\nabout them.\n\nThere was a dull rumble, but the confined space and the thick walls of\nthe ship shut most of it out. It was followed by a sickening dizzy\nmotion to the submarine. She seemed about to roll over and those in her\ngrabbed frantically at the sides. The next instant the craft plunged\ndown, down, down, into the water which was filled with broken cakes of\nice, that rattled against the steel sides, like peas in a pan.\n\nDown and down the _Porpoise_ went, for her tanks were full. More and\nmore rapidly she continued to sink, until it seemed she would fetch up\nin the deepest cavern of the ocean.\n\n\"We's gwine t' Mars Davy Jones's locker, suah!\" Washington exclaimed as\nhe looked at the depth gages.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF A GRAVEYARD OF WRECKED\nSHIPS.--_Page 200._]\n\n\"Has the experiment succeeded?\" asked Andy of Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I think so,\" was the answer. \"At any rate we are free from the ice,\ntemporarily at least. We are sinking down through the hole the dynamite\nmade, just as I hoped we would.\"\n\n\"Where will we end up?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"No one knows,\" replied the captain. \"But I would say--\"\n\nAt that instant the ship stopped sinking and brought up with a bump.\n\n\"I should say we were at the end of this part of our journey,\" finished\nthe inventor.\n\nHe turned off the cabin lights and lighted the search lamps that threw a\ngleam so the water could be looked at from the bull's-eyes windows. The\nsight that met their gaze was an astonishing one.\n\nThey were in the midst of a graveyard of wrecked ships, and, on every\nside, scattered over the ocean bed, were the broken hulks that had once\nbeen stately vessels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nCAUGHT BY SEA SUCKERS\n\n\n\"What sort of a place is this?\" asked Andy, as he gazed at the last\nresting spot of the big ships.\n\n\"They have probably drifted here with the ocean currents, become caught\nin the ice and have remained here hundreds of years,\" said Mr.\nHenderson. \"Some of the ships are very old, and, by their build must\nhave sailed the waters centuries ago.\"\n\n\"Maybe some of them are treasure ships,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"They might be,\" admitted the professor.\n\n\"Then we'll go aboard and get the gold,\" spoke Mark.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll be disappointed,\" went on the inventor. \"In the first\nplace most treasure ships are looted before they sink. And it would be\nvery dangerous for any of us to venture to explore those hulks.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Because they are rotten, and liable to fall to pieces any minute. If\nyou happened to be in one at the time you would be caught in the\nwreckage and eventually drowned even though you had on a diving suit.\nThen, again, the ice here is constantly shifting about, and a sudden\nmotion of the under-water floe might carry you hundreds of miles away.\nSo we will not try to hunt for any fortunes on the sunken ships.\"\n\nWith this the boys were forced to be content. They stood at the small\nwindows looking at the skeletons of ships that lay on every side of the\n_Porpoise_. Some of the craft were big steamers, and others were small\nsailing vessels. A few had jagged holes in the hulls, showing how they\nhad been damaged. A few stood upright, with sails all set, as if\ndisaster had suddenly come upon them.\n\n\"Well, what is the next move?\" asked Andy after a pause. \"Are we going\nto stay here?\"\n\n\"We are going to find the South Pole,\" spoke Mr. Henderson suddenly.\n\"That is what I set out to do, and I am going to accomplish it if\npossible. We have had many accidents and a harder time in some respects\nthan when we made our trip to the north in the air ship. But I am sure\nwe shall succeed. Start the ship to the south, Washington.\"\n\n\"But we may run into an iceberg,\" objected the old hunter, who was\ninclined to be cautious.\n\n\"I think not,\" answered Mr. Henderson. \"I believe we are on a sort of\nlevel plane between two vast upper and lower fields of ice. We can go\nfreely in any direction excepting up or down.\"\n\n\"How is that?\" asked Mark. \"I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"Because there is, I believe, a big sheet of ice above us, one, say\nseveral hundred feet thick. The same thing is below us, between us and\nthe real bed of the ocean.\"\n\n\"But suppose we have to go up to renew our air supply?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"We can't go,\" replied the inventor.\n\n\"Then we will die.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. We will steam along until we come to a place where\nthere is no ice above us.\"\n\n\"But I thought you said there was nothing but ice above us now.\"\n\n\"So there is, but I intend to head due south and there, I believe, we\nwill find an open polar sea. If we do my theory will be proved and we\nwill have made a great discovery.\"\n\n\"Forward then!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Let us strike for the open sea.\"\n\nThe _Porpoise_ began to move ahead. She steamed slowly, for Mr.\nHenderson realized that he was in dangerous waters. He took his position\nin the conning tower, and had Jack with him to assist in looking for\nany obstructions that they might unexpectedly meet.\n\nThe big searchlight gave a fine illumination, for the ice above and\nbelow reflected back the beams, and what would otherwise have been a sea\nof darkness was made one of daylight.\n\nThe water swarmed with fish, but they were like none that the\nadventurers had ever seen or dreamed of before. There were monsters with\nhideous heads, and eyes so large that they occupied nearly half of the\nugly bodies.\n\nThen there were serpent-like forms, fish with long slender bodies and\nwhip-fashioned tails, with jaws that extended before them for ten feet\nor more. Others there were, great lumbering monsters that crawled along\non the ice, somewhat as seals do.\n\nAfter several hours' travel the submarine ran into a school of fish that\nhad shapes like those of polar bears, while their heads were like those\nof sharks. The creatures swarmed up to the side of the vessel, and some\nscratched with their claw-like fins on the glass windows of the conning\ntower and the side bull's-eyes.\n\nA meal was prepared by Washington, and all the adventurers brought good\nappetites to the table. On and on rushed the ship, every hour coming\nnearer and nearer to the pole.\n\nProfessor Henderson had turned the steering of the craft over to Mark,\nwho, with Jack as an assistant was sending her along at a good speed,\nwhen suddenly the submarine seemed to slacken in her progress.\n\n\"What's the matter now I wonder?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Maybe the engine bearings got hot, and Washington had to slow up to\ncool them,\" suggested Jack.\n\nHe looked through one of the side windows in the conning tower, a moment\nlater, and uttered a cry of fear.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mark.\n\nJack pointed with a hand that trembled from fright. Staring at them\nthrough the thick glass of the bull's-eye the boys beheld the most\nhideous sea monster they had yet encountered.\n\nIt seemed to be a vast circular mass of flesh, twenty feet in diameter,\nand, in the middle were two openings each three feet across. They were\nlike big holes, and, at the farther end of them could be seen two\nunblinking eyes. In the centre was a horrible mouth, armed with a triple\nrow of teeth.\n\nDown below there was a short body, at the end of which was a smaller\ndisk, armed with a sharp horny point.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jack in a whisper.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Mark.\n\nA moment later Mr. Henderson came up the companionway into the tower. He\ncaught one glimpse of the monster.\n\n\"It is the great sucker of the polar seas!\" he exclaimed. \"Quick! Speed\nup the engine! If that one, and the mates of it, fasten on to us we will\nhave trouble!\"\n\nHe pressed the signal that connected with the engine room, and told\nWashington to start the engine at its greatest power. The next instant\nthe ship throbbed and trembled under the vibrations of the big screw.\n\n\"We may escape!\" cried the professor.\n\nAs he spoke the ship seemed to come to a sudden stop. The engine could\nstill be felt moving, and the big screw still churned the water to foam\nin the tunnel, but the craft was stationary.\n\n\"We are caught!\" exclaimed the professor.\n\n\"So we are!\"\n\nThe windows in the conning tower were darkened. The big sucker had\nthrown itself forward and spread itself over the glass, clasping its\nhorrible form half way about the submarine.\n\n\"Let's look at the other windows! There may be only one of the\ncreatures!\" Mr. Henderson exclaimed, as he hurried down the companion\nway and into the main cabin. He threw back the slides covering the\nglass.\n\nThe sight that met his eyes caused him to recoil in horror. There,\npressing their shapes against the steel sides, and over the bull's-eyes\nof the ship were two more of the gigantic suckers!\n\nThe ship had now ceased to move, and Washington, in the engine room,\nfeeling that something was wrong, had shut off the power. The\nadventurers were caught in a trap more terrible than that of the ice,\nthe volcanic mountain, or the Sargasso Sea. It was a trap from which\nthey might never escape.\n\nThe suckers, thinking the submarine was perhaps a species of fish, like\nthemselves, and one of their enemies, had fastened on it their fatal\nvice-like grip. To move through the water, with the weight of all that\nclinging flesh was impossible.\n\n\"What sort of creatures are they?\" asked Jack, speaking in a whisper, so\ngreat was the terror inspired by the presence of the gigantic sea\nsuckers.\n\n\"I never saw any of them before,\" replied the professor, \"but I have\nread about them. They live only in the polar regions and are a species\nof octupus, only more terrible. Their powers of suction are enormous,\nand once they fasten on a fish or animal they never let go until they\nhave absorbed it completely. They act in the same way that a star fish\ndoes on an oyster.\"\n\n\"But they can't eat the ship,\" said Jack.\n\n\"No, I fancy the steel and iron sides will prevent them from making a\nmeal of us.\"\n\n\"Then where is the danger?\"\n\n\"They will not let go until they discover that they cannot devour us,\nand it may take days. We can only remain under water a comparatively\nshort time at the most. So you see where the danger is.\"\n\n\"But can't we go out and kill them? Then they would let go.\"\n\n\"It would be most risky to venture out, protected even with a diving\nsuit, and carrying the electric guns,\" the professor went on. \"No, I\nmust think of some other plan to free ourselves from the creatures.\"\n\n\"Blow 'em up wif dynamite an' send 'em inter disproportionately\ncontrastedable circumferences!\" exclaimed Washington, who had been\nlistening to the conversation.\n\n\"This isn't any time to joke,\" Mr. Henderson said sternly.\n\n\"I wasn't joking,\" replied the colored man. \"Can't we squirt acid on 'em\nor chop 'em up, or--or--\"\n\n\"We can do nothing for the time being,\" said the professor. \"Come, we\nwill have a consultation on the subject. Perhaps some one may be able to\nthink of a plan of rescue.\"\n\n\"Let us hope so.\"\n\nThey all gathered in the cabin. The professor explained the nature of\nthe creatures, as far as he knew them from what he had read or heard. He\npointed out, through the glass windows, over which the suckers were\nstill clinging, how they maintained their grip, by exhausting, through\ntheir big mouths, the air between their saucer-like surfaces and the\nship to which they were clinging.\n\n\"Can't we go out and fight 'em?\" asked Andy, who was always ready to use\na gun.\n\n\"I doubt if we could get out,\" replied the professor. \"Though we can not\nsee them, I believe the creatures cover every part of the ship from stem\nto stern. We could never open the door of the diving chamber with that\nterrible sucker covering the iron portal.\"\n\n\"Maybe if we wait long enough a lot of sharks will come along and eat\n'em up,\" put in Jack.\n\n\"I am afraid sharks will not come to these frozen waters,\" said the\nprofessor. \"They like a warm climate.\"\n\n\"And you don't think it would be feasible to use dynamite,\" asked Mark.\n\n\"We can't get out to place it where it would blow up the fish and not\nus,\" answered Mr. Henderson. \"If we could it might serve.\"\n\nA silence fell on the group. They were in sore straits and there seemed\nno hope of rescue. The big disk-like bodies that covered the windows did\nnot move, but remained there, staring with horrible persistency into the\ninterior of the ship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nLAND UNDER ICE\n\n\nSuddenly the craft began to move. Slowly at first, then, with more speed\nit forged ahead through the water.\n\n\"Are we free?\" asked Andy, starting up.\n\n\"Who started the machinery?\" demanded the professor.\n\n\"No one,\" replied Jack. \"We are all here. There is no one in the engine\nroom.\"\n\n\"But we are moving,\" said Mark.\n\n\"It's dem sucker-fish!\" exclaimed Washington. \"Dey is takin' us off to\nder dens an' dere we'll all be eat up!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid part of it is true,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"The creatures are\ncertainly making off with us. How powerful they must be!\"\n\n\"Will dey take us to a cave?\" faltered Washington. \"Will dey eat us up?\"\n\n\"I don't think they'll eat us up,\" spoke the inventor. \"It would defy\neven their powerful sucking apparatus to bore through the steel sides of\nthe _Porpoise_. What I am afraid of is that they may move us to some\nhidden depth where we will be caught under the rocks or in the ice, and\nso lose what little chance there is of getting free.\"\n\n\"And the worst of it is we can't do a thing to help ourselves!\"\nexclaimed Andy. \"This is the worst game I was ever up against!\"\n\nThe adventurers were indeed helpless. They could not get out of their\nship to attack the monsters, even had they dared to. Their engine,\npowerful as it was, had proved no match for the creatures, and now they\nwere being carried away, ship and all, to some unknown place.\n\nThe ship did not go through the water fast. Though the suckers seemed to\nbe working in union their bodies were too unwieldly, and the ship so\nlarge, that their pace was slow. Nevertheless they kept steadily on.\n\nSeveral times, in their desperation, the adventurers tried the force of\nthe big screw against that of the suckers. It was of no avail. Neither\nwas the device of emptying the tanks, and trying to force the craft up\nas far as the roof of ice would permit it to go.\n\n\"It's of no use,\" announced Mr. Henderson with something that sounded\nlike a groan. \"We must prepare for the worst.\"\n\n\"How long can we live here without going to the surface after a fresh\nsupply of air?\" asked Bill.\n\n\"About three days,\" was the answer. \"I took the precaution to put a\ndouble supply into the tanks, in readiness for an emergency, but I never\nthought of such a terrible situation as this.\"\n\nThe submarine seemed to be moving more rapidly now. It was useless to\ntry to see through either the windows in the side or in the conning\ntower, for all the glass was covered by the horrible bodies.\n\n\"What will they do with us when they get us where they want us?\" asked\nAndy.\n\n\"What can they do except hold us prisoners until--until--\" The professor\nbroke off the sentence he dared not finish.\n\nFor an hour or more the craft was moved through the water at moderate\nspeed. Then it came to a stop. Those on board were alert for what might\nhappen next.\n\n\"I guess dey done got us in der cave,\" said Washington with chattering\nteeth. \"Now dey'll begin to devour us wid dem terrible big mouths!\nGolly, I wish I was home!\"\n\n\"Stop that nonsense!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"Be a man! There is no\ndanger yet. The sides of the _Porpoise_ will defy worse enemies than\nthose attacking us!\"\n\nAt that instant the ship began to move again. It was hauled slowly\nthrough the water.\n\n\"They are pulling us backward!\" said Andy, as he watched the needle of\nthe compass.\n\nOnce more the submarine was stopped. Then it moved forward at a more\nrapid pace than at any time since the suckers had seized it. An instant\nlater it brought up against some solid object with such a jar that those\ninside were thrown off their feet.\n\n\"Something has hit us!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"More likely we've struck something,\" said the professor.\n\nAgain the ship forged to the rear, and once again it was sent swiftly\nahead. Then came the second shock, harder than the first, which sent\nsome of the party headlong.\n\n\"They are banging us against a rock!\" cried Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Do you mean those sea suckers?\"\n\n\"Yes. They have probably found that the shell of the _Porpoise_ is too\nhard even for their powerful jaws. So they have taken us to some place\nwhere the rocks show and are banging us against them in order to break\nthe ship, so they can get at what is inside.\"\n\nOnce more the ship was drawn backward and again dashed against the\nstone. The shock was a hard one and toppled over all who were not\nclinging to something.\n\n\"They are ramming us bow on against the rocks,\" cried Andy. \"It will\nbreak us apart if they hit us many more times!\"\n\nWashington hurried forward. He came back with his eyes showing terror.\n\n\"There's a lot of rocks right ahead ob us!\" he exclaimed. \"I see 'em\nthrough th' little window jest above th' screw. There's land under this\nhere water!\"\n\n\"Land under this ice do you mean?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"That's what I mean, an' we's bein' rammed agin th' rocks!\"\n\n\"There it goes again!\" cried Jack, as the ship shivered from stem to\nstern against the impact of the blow.\n\n\"This can not last long,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"If they strike us many\nmore times some of the places will start, the water will come in, and we\nwill drown!\"\n\n\"But what can we do?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Let's go out now and see if we can't kill some of the beasts with the\nguns,\" suggested Andy.\n\n\"I cannot permit it,\" answered the inventor. \"Our position is bad enough\nas it is, but to go out would be to lose our lives for a certainty. The\nsuckers would swallow us up in a moment. I must find some other way.\"\n\nThere was a period of silence, while all waited anxiously for what was\nto happen next. It was not long in coming. The next impact of the ship\nagainst the rocks was the hardest yet, and it seemed that more of the\nsuckers must have gripped the craft.\n\n\"She's leakin' a little!\" exclaimed Washington coming back from an\ninspection forward. \"De water am tricklin' in!\"\n\n\"We must fight them!\" exclaimed Andy. He ran to get a gun and his diving\nsuit.\n\n\"Don't try to go out!\" warned the professor. \"You will surely be\nkilled.\"\n\n\"I'd rather be killed out there than die shut up in the ship!\" cried the\nold hunter. \"I'm going out!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" exclaimed Jack suddenly. \"I have a plan that may save us!\"\n\n\"What is it? Speak quickly!\" said Mr. Henderson. \"We are in desperate\nstraits!\"\n\nAs he spoke there came another crash against the rocks.\n\n\"We must electrocute the suckers!\" cried the boy.\n\n\"Electrocute them? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Take the wires from the electric light circuit, attach one to each end\nof the ship, and start the dynamo at full speed!\" answered Jack.\n\n\"What good will that do?\"\n\n\"The ship is steel,\" went on the boy. \"It will become charged with a\npowerful current. We can insulate ourselves by putting on rubber boots,\nbut the shock of the electricity will kill the creatures!\"\n\n\"Good for you!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"Quick boys, everybody lend a\nhand! Washington, detach the wires and run one to the bow and the other\nto the stern of the ship. Then get out the boots.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the dynamo was ready to send a death-dealing current\nthrough the entire ship. The professor and all the others put on the\nboots, that were a part of the diving equipment. The dynamo was started\nat full speed and the purring hum told that electricity of great power\nwas being developed.\n\nThe professor stood with his hand on a switch, ready to close the\ncircuit as soon as sufficient power had accumulated. Once more the\nsuckers backed the ship in order to give it impetus for another impact\non the stones.\n\nClick! The professor snapped the switch shut. There was a burst of\nbluish-green flame, and the movement of the boat suddenly ceased.\n\n\"I guess that does for 'em!\" shouted Andy.\n\n\"Wait a few minutes,\" advised the professor. \"The suckers may not all be\ndead yet!\"\n\nHe kept the current flowing throughout the length of the ship for\nseveral minutes, and then turned it off.\n\n\"Now to see if the plan worked,\" he said. The windows in the cabin were\neagerly scanned.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Mark. \"The suckers have gone!\"\n\n\"I guess the electricity killed them,\" spoke Mr. Henderson. \"We will\nventure out now in our diving suits and see what sort of a place we are\nin.\"\n\nSoon the adventurers were arrayed in the heavy suits. Under them they\nwore thick clothing, and in each suit was placed a small flat heater,\noperated by a storage battery. The heaters were made of coils of fine\nwires, and the electric current, meeting with much resistance in passing\nthrough them, heated the coils, so there was considerable warmth.\n\nIt was all needed as they found when they felt the water entering the\ndiving chamber, for the fluid was as cold as an ocean full of icebergs\ncould make it. Protected however by the heavy suits, warm clothing and\nthe heaters the divers were fairly comfortable.\n\nThe outer door was opened and they all started back in amazement at the\nsight which met their eyes. Before them lay a forest of real trees, with\nbushes growing among them, while the ground, instead of being like the\nusual ocean bed was covered with grass.\n\nAs Washington had said, on getting a small view of the place from the\nlittle window, it was real land under water.\n\nTheir first surprise at the strange spectacle over, the adventurers\nglanced about for a sight of the terrible sea suckers. But they need not\nhave feared. Lying in a huddled up mass toward the rear of the\n_Porpoise_ were the dead bodies of the ugly creatures. The electricity\nhad finished them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nATTACKED BY AN OCTUPUS\n\n\nThey walked some distance away from the ship, for the land under the\nwater was easy to travel on. It looked exactly as if some beautiful\nvalley had suddenly been submerged in the middle of summer, when\neverything was fresh and green.\n\nThey had gone perhaps a quarter of a mile from the _Porpoise_ when\nProfessor Henderson motioned to them that they had better return. On\ntheir way back they passed what looked to be a large cave in the side of\na hill. Wondering what could be in it, Mark and Jack paused to peer into\nthe black opening.\n\nThe next instant two long white things, like slender serpents shot out.\nWith the rapidity of lightning they wrapped themselves, one about each\nboy, and, before the horrified companions of the lads could do anything\nthe unfortunate youths were whisked out of sight into the cavern.\n\nFor a few seconds no one knew what to do. To rush in to the rescue of\nthe boys would have been foolhardy, as the terrible octupus, which they\nknew had grabbed the lads, would have been a match for all of the\nadventurers, unarmed as they were.\n\nIt would be necessary to return to the ship and come back with some of\nthe electric guns, which they had neglected to bring with them. In the\nmeanwhile the beast might, and probably would, kill Mark and Jack. But\nthere was nothing else to do.\n\nThe professor motioned for Andy to remain on the watch at the mouth of\nthe cavern, so as to be on hand in case he could help the boys, while\nthe others were hurrying toward the ship. Then, leading the way, the\nProfessor signalled for Tom and Bill to follow him.\n\nThey could not hurry much for the heavy suits and the resistance of the\nwater impeded their progress. But they made all the speed they could,\nurged on by a terrible fear.\n\nMeanwhile old Andy stood in front of the cave, hoping against hope that\nthere might be some way of aiding the boys. If it had happened above\nwater he would not have hesitated to rush in and give battle to the\nbeast, even though he was unarmed. If he had his knife now he would\nventure in, at the risk of his life.\n\n\"Oh, why didn't I bring my gun along!\" thought Andy regretfully.\n\nHis hand dropped to his side and his fingers came in contact with a big\nknife in the belt of the diving suit. Here was a weapon he had forgotten\nall about.\n\nHe drew forth the blade. It seemed a small one with which to attack so\nlarge and terrible a creature as the octupus. Yet to remain there,\nknowing the boys were being killed was more than old Andy could stand.\nGrasping the handle with a firm grip he started toward the cave. His\nfoot caught in something, and he nearly fell.\n\nLooking down to see what had tripped him he saw a long thin pole,\nstraight as a lance. It had once been a tree limb, but all the branches\nwere stripped off.\n\n\"Now if I only had an iron point for that,\" Andy thought. Then he\nrecollected the knife in his hand.\n\n\"The very thing,\" he remarked aloud, the words sounding startlingly loud\nin the confinement of the copper helmet. \"If I only had something to\nfasten the knife on the pole I could make a spear to attack the\noctupus.\"\n\nThen he saw long streamers of sea weed growing up from the ocean bed.\nThey were very tough, a kind of wirey grass that was as strong as rope.\nAndy cut several streamers and, with a hunter's skill bound the knife to\nthe end of the staff.\n\nNow he had a weapon formidable enough to venture in and give battle to\nthe monster. He hesitated no longer, fearing that even the short delay\nmight have been too much and that the boys were dead. He entered the\ncave. At first he could perceive nothing for it was quite dark. Then, as\nhis eyes became used to the gloom, which the lamp in his helmet faintly\nilluminated, he saw, far back in the rear, the horrible octupus.\n\nTwo dark objects, around which were wrapped several folds of the\nterrible arms, Andy guessed to be Mark and Jack, and when he was a faint\nglow coming from them he was sure they were the boys, the gleams coming\nfrom the lamps in their helmets.\n\nWarily the hunter approached the creature. If he had hoped to take it\nunawares he was disappointed, for, when he had come within ten feet,\nholding his improvised lance outstretched ready for a deadly thrust, the\ncreature shot out two long arms toward Andy.\n\nNow the battle began. The snake-like feelers, armed with big saucer\nshaped suckers, lashed about in the water, seeking to clasp the hunter\nin their deadly embrace. But Andy, who had fought many kinds of wild\nanimals on land, did not lose his presence of mind in confronting this\nbeast of the sea.\n\nNimbly, in spite of the handicap of the heavy diving suit, Andy dodged\nthe arms. Watching his chance he thrust at one, and the sharp knife\nsevered the end. But another arm shot out, while the wounded one was\ndrawn in, and the battle was as much against the old hunter as before.\n\nOnce more he thrust his lance, and this time he severed one of the arms\nclose to the ugly body. The creature, in its rage and pain, redoubled\nits efforts to clasp Andy.\n\nThe hunter decided to try to get to closer quarters where he could use\nhis spear on the body of the beast. He stooped down and wiggled along on\nthe bottom of the cave. But the creature saw him, and darted an arm out\nto pull the old man in. Andy squirmed to one side, and then, being as\nclose as he desired, he rose to his feet and, drawing back the pole\nthrust it with all his force straight at the centre of the\nwhitish-yellow body that was like a horrible lump of soft fat directly\nin front of him.\n\nAt the first touch of the knife the creature squirted out an inky\nsubstance that made the water about it as black as night. Andy could not\nsee, but he could feel that the lance was still in the body. He pulled\nit back a little and thrust again and again, turning it around to\nenlarge the wound he had made.\n\nThen, what he had feared all along happened. Two of the creatures arms\nfound him, and he felt the terrible pressure as they wound themselves\nabout him, the sucker-plates clinging fast. Yet in it all he did not\nlose his presence of mind, nor did he let go of the pole.\n\nTighter and tighter the arms clasped him. He struggled with all his\nstrength but he was in a grip more powerful than that of a boa\nconstrictor. Suddenly the pole he was holding snapped off. He let go the\nuseless end and pulled the shorter part, to which the knife was bound,\ntoward him. Andy felt his senses beginning to leave him, but he\ndetermined to make one more effort.\n\nOne hand was free, that holding the knife. With his last remaining\nstrength he cut and slashed at the arms of the creature that were\nclasped about him.\n\nAgain and again he stuck the blade into the gristle like substance.\nCould he win? Could he save his own life, to say nothing of that of the\ntwo boys?\n\nThe creature was lashing about now so that the water was a mass of black\nfoam. The ink-color was beginning to fade away. Andy could dimly observe\nthe horrible front of the octupus, and see the wound his lance had made.\nThen all seemed to grow dark again. He dimly remembered trying to\nthrust the knife into one of the saucer-shaped eyes, and then of a\nsudden his senses left him.\n\nWhen Andy came to his senses he found himself lying on the ocean bed\njust outside the cave. About him stood the professor, Washington, Tom\nand Bill. His head buzzed and he felt weak, but he knew he was\nuninjured, and that his diving suit had not been punctured in the fight\nwith the octupus, for he could feel the fresh air entering from the tank\nat the back of his helmet.\n\nWere the boys killed, Andy wondered. Had his fight to save them been in\nvain? He managed to stand up, and then, to his relief he saw Mark and\nJack standing behind Tom and Bill. The boys seemed weak but otherwise\nuninjured.\n\nThe professor motioned to know if Andy could walk and the old hunter\nsoon demonstrated that he could by stepping forward. Then the party\nproceeded slowly to the ship.\n\nLittle time was lost by each one in divesting himself of his diving suit\nas soon as they had left the water chamber. The first thing Andy asked\nwhen his helmet was off, was:\n\n\"Did I kill the beast?\"\n\n\"Indeed you did,\" replied the professor. \"And just in time, too. You\nwere about done for when we came back with the guns, but they were not\nneeded. My! But you must have had a terrible fight!\"\n\n\"I did, while it lasted,\" said the hunter. \"But were the boys hurt?\"\n\n\"They can speak for themselves,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"I guess not,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Having the wind almost squeezed out of us was the worst that happened,\"\nsaid Mark. \"The octupus must have recently dined when it grabbed us, for\nit didn't offer to eat us. And it didn't grip us as tightly as it might\nhave or I reckon we wouldn't have come out alive. I thought sure we were\ngoing to be killed, however.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" put in Jack.\n\n\"I don't want any more such fights this trip,\" said Andy with a weak\nsmile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nOUT OF THE ICE\n\n\nWorn out with their encounter with the octupus, Andy and the boys were\nglad to take to their bunks. The others, too, who were weary from\ntraveling under water, felt the need of rest, and so it was decided to\nlet the ship remain stationary down on the bottom of the ocean for\nseveral hours before going on further.\n\n\"When we get rested up we'll have a good meal, and then try to gain the\nsurface of the ocean,\" said the professor.\n\nThere was quiet on board the _Porpoise_ for a long time. Washington was\nthe first to awake and he at once set about getting a meal. When it was\nready he called the professor, and, one after another all the\nadventurers rose from their bunks and refreshed themselves with hot\ncoffee, bacon, eggs and preserves, all prepared from condensed foods, of\nwhich a large supply had been brought.\n\n\"Now to see if we can make our way upward through the ice,\" announced\nMr. Henderson.\n\n\"We ought to be far enough south to strike the open polar sea which I\nbelieve exists.\"\n\nThe engine was started after the small leaks in the bow, caused by the\nramming of the boat on the rocks, had been stopped up, and the\nprofessor, entering the conning tower, turned her due south.\n\nThe screw vibrated in the tunnel, the water rushed out in a big stream,\nthe engines and dynamos hummed, and the hearts of all were lightened as\nthey knew they were nearing the goal of their journey.\n\nSeveral hours passed and the professor, who was keeping watch of the\ngages noted they had covered more than one hundred miles. As the supply\nof compressed air was getting low Mr. Henderson, not wanting to run any\nchances, decided to make an attempt to reach the surface and refill the\ntanks.\n\nAccordingly the water tanks were emptied of their ballast, the rudder\nwas set to force the ship to the surface, and soon the depth gage showed\na constantly decreasing amount of water over the heads of the\nadventurers.\n\n\"Now, if we don't hit the ice above us we'll be all right,\" spoke Mr.\nHenderson. \"We are within fifteen feet of the surface.\"\n\nHardly had he ceased speaking when the _Porpoise_ brought up against\nsomething with a bump that jarred everyone. Then the submarine went\nscraping along, hitting the conning tower every now and then.\n\n\"Not clear of the ice yet,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"We must go down a\nlittle and try again.\"\n\nThe tanks were filled with enough water to keep the boat about fifty\nfeet under the surface, and at that depth she was sent ahead at full\nspeed. The professor's face wore an anxious look, and when Washington\nasked him if it was not time to replenish the air supply of the boat the\ninventor told the colored man to be very sparing of the contents of the\ncompressing tanks.\n\n\"I'm afraid we are not as near the open sea as I at first thought,\" Mr.\nHenderson finished.\n\nOn and on rushed the _Porpoise_. The engines were kept at full speed,\nand after two hours of this fast run another attempt was made to reach\nthe surface. Once more the thick ice intervened.\n\n\"Guess we'll have to blast our way out,\" observed Andy. \"We seem to have\nlots of trouble on this trip.\"\n\n\"Why not try to ram your way through,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I mean to sink the boat say two hundred feet. Then start her up\nobliquely and perhaps the sharp prow will cut a hole through the ice.\"\n\n\"Hardly through ice fifteen feet or more thick,\" said the captain\ndespondently.\n\n\"But it may be thinner now,\" persisted Jack.\n\n\"At any rate it will do no harm to try,\" the inventor admitted. \"We can\nnot last much longer down here.\"\n\nAgain the tanks were filled, and by the aid of the deflecting rudder the\n_Porpoise_ went down into the depths. Then the ballast tanks were\nquickly emptied, and the rudder turned so as to force the craft upward\non a slant. The engine was set going at top speed.\n\n\"Hold fast everybody!\" called the professor. \"It is kill or cure this\ntrip!\"\n\nLike an arrow from a bow the _Porpoise_ shot upward. On and on it sped,\ngathering momentum with every foot she traveled.\n\nSuddenly there came a terrible crash, a grinding sound and a rending and\ntearing. The ship trembled from end to end. Every one was knocked from\nhis feet. There were bumpings and scrapings all along the sides of the\nsubmarine. Then, with one final spurt of speed, the little ship tore her\nway through the ice and emerged, with a splash and shower of foam into\nthe open sea!\n\nQuickly the man hole was opened and, half dead from lack of fresh air,\nthe adventurers crawled out on deck. It was night and the stars\nglittered in the sky above. They were just beyond the edge of the ice\nfield, and all about them was a wide open sea.\n\n\"I was right after all,\" said the professor, \"but I miscalculated the\ndistance. Had we gone on a few feet farther it would not have been\nnecessary to break through the ice.\"\n\n\"I guess it's a lucky thing we didn't try it before either,\" remarked\nAndy. \"We never could have bored through fifteen feet of the frozen\nstuff. Where we plowed up it is less than two feet,\" and he pointed to\nwhere the immense floe came to an end.\n\nIt was decided to go no farther that night, however, as the professor\nwanted to take some observations by daylight and ascertain his position.\nSo filling their lungs with the air, cold and piercing though it was,\nthe adventurers descended to their cabin, and lots were drawn to see who\nwould stand the two night watches. It fell to Mr. Henderson to take the\nfirst, and Washington the second. The captain accordingly took up his\nposition in the conning tower and prepared to pass several hours.\n\nHe was busy thinking over the exciting times he and his companions had\npassed through, and planning new trips to see more wonders of the world,\nwhen his attention was attracted by slight noise near the man hole\nleading to the amidship companionway.\n\nThe professor looked up, and was startled to see a tall white object,\nwith outstretched arms advancing toward him with slow and stealthy\ntread.\n\n\"The ghost again!\" exclaimed the inventor softly. \"I must catch it now,\nand see what foolishness it is,\" for the professor did not believe in\nspirits.\n\nHe got down on his hands and knees the better to escape observation,\nshould the white thing prove to be a bodily substance, and started to\ncrawl toward it. He came within ten feet of the thing, and could make\nout that it was a man, or at least the semblance of one, all clothed in\nwhite.\n\nNearer and nearer the inventor crawled to the thing. It turned to face\nhim now and Mr. Henderson could not help feeling startled as he saw the\nobject had no head. The neck ended in a white stump.\n\nIn spite of a little feeling of qualmishness, which even his boasted\ndisbelief in ghosts did not save him from, Mr. Henderson was about to\nspring upon the thing and solve the mystery.\n\nAt that instant, however, Washington, who was coming on deck to take up\nhis watch, appeared at the head of the companionway, and caught sight of\nthe terrible object.\n\nThe yells of the colored man as he dove downward and back into the\ncabin, aroused the ship. Determined to solve the mystery, in spite of\neverything, the professor made a leap forward. He slipped, and tumbled\ndown the iron stairway. At the same time, the ghost, with a blood\ncurdling yell, leaped over the professor's back, and disappeared down\nthe stairs of the conning tower.\n\nIn an instant the crew were rushing from their bunk rooms, seeking a\nmeaning for the disturbance.\n\n\"It was the ghost again,\" explained the professor as he picked himself\nup, not much the worse for his tumble. \"I tried to catch it, but I\ndidn't. Come, Washington, it is your turn to stand watch.\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" said Washington firmly.\n\nIt was no use to urge him, so Jack good-naturedly stood Washington's\ntrick. Nothing further however occurred that night.\n\nIn the morning the professor made several observations and found that he\nwas within one hundred and fifty miles of the south pole.\n\n\"We'll make it to-morrow, if we have luck,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE BOILING WATER\n\n\nThe hours passed and the strange voyage continued.\n\nThe _Porpoise_ traveled along at good speed, and the professor devoted\nmost of his time to looking after the different scientific instruments\nand gages, for they were nearing the south pole. The deflecting compass,\nwhich when it came directly over the place corresponding to the pole,\nwould point straight up and down, was assuming more and more of a\nperpendicular position.\n\n\"We are getting there!\" exclaimed the professor with delight. \"A few\nhours more and we will have won the goal!\"\n\nThere was considerable excitement on board when the professor's\nannouncement was made. Though few of the adventurers cared as much for\nthe scientific achievement as did Mr. Henderson, they were all glad he\nwas about to succeed. To most of them the locating of the south pole was\nno different from visiting some new country, excepting that there were\nmore adventures than on most voyages.\n\nAt dusk the _Porpoise_ went to the surface and during the night traveled\nalong atop of the billows. In the morning she dived below again. The\nengine was started at high speed and the deflecting needle dipped still\nmore.\n\n\"We's gittin' dar!\" exclaimed Washington as he oiled the various\nbearings of the machinery.\n\nBreakfast was served and hurriedly eaten, for the excitement was telling\non every one. After the meal had been cleared away they all sat in the\ndarkened cabin looking out at the water as it slipped past the glass\nwindows. Big and little fish swam up and peered into the bull's-eyes and\nthen darted away.\n\n\"That's sort of queer,\" remarked Jack a little later.\n\n\"What is?\" asked Mark, who was sitting near his chum.\n\n\"All the fish seem to have suddenly disappeared,\" replied Jack. \"There\nwere hundreds a little while ago, and now I haven't seen one looking in\nthe windows for some time.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there's a big fish on their trail,\" observed Mark. \"That's what\nmakes 'em take to the deep sea weed.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Jack.\n\nA little later Professor Henderson entered the room. He went over,\nlooked at the thermometer, and then called to Washington:\n\n\"Have you got the heat turned on?\"\n\n\"No, sah! I ain't done truned on no superheated vapor into de\nradiators,\" replied the colored man. \"I were jest thinkin' dat we'd hit\nde south pole by de feel of it.\"\n\n\"It is getting strangely warm,\" admitted Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Ain't that what you expected at the south pole?\" asked Andy. \"I thought\nit was hot at the south pole and cold at the north.\"\n\n\"That's what lots of people imagine,\" said the professor, \"but except\nfor the open sea, which I have proved does exist, I guess it's just as\ncold at the south as at the north, especially in the winter. We have\nstruck the summer season.\"\n\n\"And a mighty warm one at that,\" observed Jack. \"Whew! I've got to take\noff my coat.\"\n\nIndeed it was getting uncomfortably warm in the ship, and the\nadventurers who had dressed in thick clothing to guard against the\nrigors of the icy climate, soon had to lay aside many of their garments.\n\n\"No wonder!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson, as he looked at a thermometer. \"It\nis eighty degrees in here!\"\n\n\"Worse than workin' in a hay field,\" observed Bill, as he wiped the\nbeads of perspiration from his forehead.\n\n\"Let us see what sort of water we are traveling through,\" suggested the\nprofessor, as he again turned off the lights in the cabin so that a view\ncould be had from the bull's-eyes.\n\nWondering what would meet their gaze the adventurers peered out of the\nsmall circular windows. At first they could hardly believe their eyes.\n\nThere, right before them, the sea was bubbling as if it was an immense\ntea kettle. Steam formed on the glass, and big clouds of vapor could be\nseen. The atmosphere of the cabin became almost unbearable.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a boiling hot ocean!\" cried the professor.\n\n\"Are we sailing through hot water?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"I should say so, from the feel of it,\" answered Mr. Henderson. \"Put\nyour hand on the side of the cabin.\"\n\nAndy laid his fingers against the steel plates. He drew back.\n\n\"I burned myself!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What are we to do?\" cried Jack.\n\n\"Get out of this by all means!\" exclaimed the inventor. \"If we stay in\nthis hot ocean we will be boiled alive like fishes in a pot. Send the\nship up, Washington!\"\n\nIndeed it was high time. The thermometer marked one hundred and ten\ndegrees, and was rising. The interior of the _Porpoise_ was like that of\na steam laundry three times heated. Stripped to their undergarments the\nadventurers were obliged to lie down on the floor of the cabin where it\nwas a little cooler.\n\nIt was all Washington could do, used as colored people are to the heat,\nto go into the engine room, and start the machinery that emptied the\ntanks, so as to allow the ship to mount to the surface.\n\nThe _Porpoise_ began to rise slowly, and to the suffering men and boys\nit seemed that she never went up so reluctantly. The heat was becoming\nunbearable. They could hear the water bubbling even through the steel\nsides of the submarine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nCould they live to reach the surface? was the thought in the mind of\nevery one. The heat was terrific. They were breathing in gasps.\nProfessor Henderson went to the water tank, thinking to throw some of\nthe fluid over himself and his companions, but he found it so warm that\nit almost burned his hand.\n\n\"Keep up your courage!\" exclaimed the inventor. \"We will soon be at the\ntop!\"\n\nAlmost as he spoke the _Porpoise_ bounded from the waves, and fell back\nin a splash of foam on the surface of the billows. They were at the\nsurface.\n\nThe professor rushed for the manhole and soon opened it. He crawled out\non the deck, followed by the others. They breathed in deep breaths of\nthe fresh air.\n\nThe submarine continued to sail on. Every minute the sea seemed to boil\nmore violently, until at last the waves were covered with a cloud of\nsteam, through which it was difficult to observe where they were going.\n\n\"Hadn't we better turn back,\" suggested Mark.\n\n\"Our only hope is to press on,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"We may cross\nthis zone of boiling water soon.\"\n\nHe went into the conning tower to make an observation. He came on the\ndeck the next minute, very much excited.\n\n\"What's the matter? Are we sinking?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"We are directly over the south pole!\" exclaimed the professor. \"We have\nreached the goal! We have come to the spot hundreds of men have tried to\nreach! It has been left for us to succeed. Look at the deflecting\nneedle!\"\n\nThey crowded into the conning tower to note it. The slender hand of\nsteel stood straight up and down, indicating that the ship was over the\nsouth pole, one of the two chief centres of magnetism of the earth.\n\n\"If we only dared stop to make some scientific notes and observations,\"\nsaid the professor, \"we could render much valuable aid to the seekers\nafter truth. But it would be sure death to stay in the boiling water!\"\n\n\"I guess we'd better be getting out of this if we want to reach home\nalive,\" spoke Andy.\n\nIndeed they were all suffering very much, for the heat from the water\nwas awful.\n\n\"Speed her up, Washington!\" called the professor. \"We must get out of\nhere!\"\n\n\"Which way shall I steer?\" asked the colored man.\n\n\"Straight ahead. We are now bound north!\"\n\n\"Bound north!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the professor. \"We have passed over the exact spot\nwhere the south pole is. The deflecting needle is beginning to tilt\nagain. The compass is indicating a northerly direction. You know that\nafter you go as far south as you can, you have to begin to go back\nnorth. Well, we have gone as far south as we can. Now we are going\nnorth. We have turned the southern end of the globe, and are on our way\nback.\"\n\nFor several hours the _Porpoise_ continued along on top of the water. By\ndegrees, as they left the vicinity of the boiling ocean, it became\ncooler. The water ceased to seethe and bubble, and Jack found, on\nexperiment, that he could bear his hand in it.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" he cried, \"we are safe now.\"\n\n\"Next we'll have to prepare to freeze to death,\" spoke Mark. \"It's\neither one extreme or the other this trip. But we've had lots of fun and\nexcitement.\"\n\n\"Plenty of the last,\" agreed Jack.\n\nOn and on went the submarine. Once it was out of the range of the\nterrible heated zone, the atmosphere rapidly cooled, until the\nadventurers were glad to don their heavy garments again.\n\n\"This marks the ending of the first half of the voyage,\" announced the\nprofessor. \"Now we are going back. We have accomplished something no\nother living man has done and I am proud of it. Proud of all of you, and\nproud of the ship!\"\n\nSeveral hours later, when it was deemed safe, the _Porpoise_ was sunk\nbeneath the waves, and once more she speeded along through the water at\na fast speed. The ship seemed to know she was going home, for never had\nshe made better time.\n\n\"We have solved every problem that we met,\" said the professor while he,\nwith Jack and Mark, were in the conning tower, as Washington was\npreparing a meal.\n\n\"Except two,\" said Jack.\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"The ghost of the submarine, and the identity of the anarchists who blew\nup the Easton hotel.\"\n\n\"Perhaps both riddles may be solved before we get back to Maine,\"\nanswered Mr. Henderson.\n\nThey both were, sooner, and in stranger ways than either of the boys\nexpected. That night it was Jack's first watch on deck. The ship was\nspeeding on, and by the air the boy knew they were approaching icebergs.\nAt midnight a strange and sudden chill in the air made him look up.\n\nAlmost dead ahead was a big berg. He quickly shut off the engine, and\nnarrowly avoided a collision. Then happening to glance back he saw,\nstanding near the companionway leading down into the man-hole a ghostly\nwhite shape.\n\n\"I'll find out what you are this time, or go overboard with you,\" said\nJack to himself, clenching his teeth. He crawled along the deck until he\nthought he was within leaping distance of the weird white thing. Then he\nmade a leap.\n\nHe landed on something soft, which, the moment he struck it, let out a\nyell that sounded loud on the quiet night. Then the thing began to\nfight. But Jack fought back and held on bravely.\n\n\"Here! What are you tryin' to do?\" exclaimed a voice in his ear.\n\n\"What are you trying to do?\" asked Jack indignantly, finding that the\nwords came from the \"ghost.\"\n\n\"Nice way to treat a man! Half kill him!\" the white thing went on. \"Just\nwhen I'm trying to get a little sleep you come along and pull me out of\nbed!\"\n\n\"Why, it's Bill Jones,\" exclaimed Jack, as the light from the conning\ntower lamp fell on the face of the \"ghost.\"\n\n\"Of course it is; who did you think it was?\" asked Bill.\n\n\"What are you doing on deck in your night shirt?\" asked the boy, letting\nthe helper rise.\n\n\"Me? On deck? Ain't I in my bunk?\"\n\n\"I should say not,\" replied Jack. \"What are you doing on deck?\"\n\n\"Well! well!\" remarked Bill, rubbing his eyes. \"I've gone and done it\nagain.\"\n\n\"Done what?\"\n\n\"Walked in my sleep. I'm a great sleep walker. Greatest you ever knew.\nOnce I climbed to the top of our barn when I was asleep.\"\n\n\"So you're the ghost of the submarine,\" exclaimed Jack. \"That explains\nit.\"\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" admitted Bill, as the others came on deck to see\nwhat all the row was about. \"I never thought of it when I heard about\nthe ghost, but I can account for it now. I'd get out of my bunk, wander\nout on deck, and then crawl back again. Of course, being barefoot, or in\nfur slippers, I made no sounds. I don't wonder you thought I was a\nspirit. Queer I didn't wake up after some of the things I went through.\"\n\n\"And you always managed to get back to your bunk in time so that we\nnever caught you at it,\" said Jack. \"However, it's all over now.\"\n\nAnd so it was, for after that Bill tied a chair in front of his bunk,\nand if he did get out in his sleep he stumbled against it and awoke\nbefore he had gone far.\n\nNorthward the _Porpoise_ continued on her journey. She entered a vast\nfield of ice, and only her ability to sink below the surface enabled her\nto get through it unharmed. There were few adventures going home. Once a\nbig whale rammed the ship, as had happened on the going voyage, and\nseveral times they were surrounded by hordes of wild polar fish and\nwalrusses, but there were no accidents, and in a couple of weeks the\nship entered the temperate zone.\n\nThen came lazy happy days of sailing through the tropical region. They\nlanded at several islands and renewed their supply of food.\n\n\"I'm coming back this way some day,\" observed Mr. Henderson one\nafternoon as the ship was sailing along on top of the waves.\n\n\"What for?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"To investigate that strange island with a big hole in the middle that\nseems to lead to the centre of the earth,\" was the answer. \"I have a\nfancy we can explore that by means of a balloon. I'm going to try.\"\n\n\"Will you take us along?\" asked the two boys.\n\n\"I'll see,\" replied the professor.\n\nAnd later on he did take them on a trip, a thousand miles\nunderground,--but that is another story to tell.\n\nIt was about a week later that the voyagers came within sight of Key\nWest.\n\n\"Off there lies the United States,\" said Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Hurrah for home!\" cried Mark.\n\nThree days later they landed at a small Florida town. The sight of the\n_Porpoise_ attracted throngs of people to the dock where she tied up.\nAmong them was a newsboy.\n\n\"Get me all the papers for the past month,\" said Jack. \"I want to see\nwhat the news is.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" put in Mark, and the papers were soon brought.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" exclaimed Jack, as soon as he had looked at several of the\nsheets.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mark, who was unfolding a paper.\n\n\"Anarchists Confess,\" read Jack. \"Two Englishmen Admit They Blew Up\nHotel Where Lord Peckham Was Stopping. No Suspicion Attaches to Two\nYouths Who So Mysteriously Disappeared!\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" joined in Mark.\n\n\"Those are only the head lines,\" went on Jack. \"There's a long story,\nand I guess it lets us out.\"\n\nThe two boys were completely cleared of the slightest shade of suspicion\nof the outrage, and there was even an interview with the English\ndetective in which he admitted that he was wrong.\n\nA week later the _Porpoise_ tied up at her own dock, whence she was\nlaunched.\n\n\"Back again,\" remarked the professor as he stepped ashore. \"I've been to\nthe south pole, and to the north pole. I wonder where I shall go next?\"\n\n\"To the big hole and underground,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Mr. Henderson with a twinkle in his eyes.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nThe Dave Dashaway Series\n\nBy ROY ROCKWOOD\n\n\nAuthor of the \"Speedwell Boys Series\" and the \"Great Marvel Series.\"\n\n=12mo.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
