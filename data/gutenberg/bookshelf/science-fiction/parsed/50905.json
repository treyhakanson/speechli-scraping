The man in gray flannels and sweatshirt let the\nsail come crumpling down and hurried past its white folds at a gait\nmade comically awkward by his cramped muscles. Slowly the rocky ledge\ncame nearer. Slowly the blue V inscribed on the cove's surface by the\nsloop's prow died. Sloop and ledge kissed so gently that he hardly had\nto reach out his hand.\n\nHe scrambled ashore, dipping a sneaker in the icy water, and threw the\nline around a boulder. Unkinking himself, he looked back through the\ncove's high and rocky mouth at the gray-green scattering of islands\nand the faint dark line that was the coast of Maine. He almost laughed\nin satisfaction at having disregarded vague warnings and done the thing\nevery man yearns to do once in his lifetime--gone to the farthest\nisland out.\n\nHe must have looked longer than he realized, because by the time he\ndropped his gaze the cove was again as glassy as if the _Annie O._ had\nalways been there. And the splotches made by his sneaker on the rock\nhad faded in the hot sun. There was something very unusual about the\nquietness of this place. As if time, elsewhere hurrying frantically,\npaused here to rest. As if all changes were erased on this one bit of\nEarth.\n\nThe man's lean, melancholy face crinkled into a grin at the banal\nfancy. He turned his back on his new friend, the little green sloop,\nwithout one thought for his nets and specimen bottles, and set out to\nexplore. The ground rose steeply at first and the oaks were close, but\nafter a little way things went downhill and the leaves thinned and he\ncame out on more rocks--and realized that he hadn't quite gone to the\nfarthest one out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoined to this island by a rocky spine, which at the present low tide\nwould have been dry but for the spray, was another green, high island\nthat the first had masked from him all the while he had been sailing.\nHe felt a thrill of discovery, just as he'd wondered back in the woods\nwhether his might not be the first human feet to kick through the\nunderbrush. After all, there were thousands of these islands.\n\nThen he was dropping down the rocks, his lanky limbs now moving\nsmoothly enough.\n\nTo the landward side of the spine, the water was fairly still. It even\nbegan with another deep cove, in which he glimpsed the spiny spheres\nof sea urchins. But from seaward the waves chopped in, sprinkling his\ntrousers to the knees and making him wince pleasurably at the thought\nof what vast wings of spray and towers of solid water must crash up\nfrom here in a storm.\n\nHe crossed the rocks at a trot, ran up a short grassy slope, raced\nthrough a fringe of trees--and came straight up against an eight-foot\nfence of heavy mesh topped with barbed wire and backed at a short\ndistance with high, heavy shrubbery.\n\nWithout pausing for surprise--in fact, in his holiday mood, using\nsurprise as a goad--he jumped for the branch of an oak whose trunk\ntouched the fence, scorning the easier lower branch on the other side\nof the tree. Then he drew himself up, worked his way to some higher\nbranches that crossed the fence, and dropped down inside.\n\nSuddenly cautious, he gently parted the shrubbery and, before the first\nsurprise could really sink in, had another.\n\nA closely mown lawn dotted with more shrubbery ran up to a snug white\nCape Cod cottage. The single strand of a radio aerial stretched the\nlength of the roof. Parked on a neat gravel driveway that crossed just\nin front of the cottage was a short, square-lined touring car that he\nrecognized from remembered pictures as an ancient Essex. The whole\nscene had about it the same odd quietness as the cove.\n\nThen, with the air of a clock-work toy coming to life, the white door\nopened and an elderly woman came out, dressed in a long, lace-edged\ndress and wide, lacy hat. She climbed into the driver's seat of the\nEssex, sitting there very stiff and tall. The motor began to chug\nbravely, gravel skittered, and the car rolled off between the trees.\n\nThe door of the house opened again and a slim girl emerged. She wore a\nwhite silk dress that fell straight from square neck-line to hip-height\nwaistline, making the skirt seem very short. Her dark hair was bound\nwith a white bandeau so that it curved close to her cheeks. A dark\nnecklace dangled against the white of the dress. A newspaper was tucked\nunder her arm.\n\nShe crossed the driveway and tossed the paper down on a rattan table\nbetween three rattan chairs and stood watching a squirrel zigzag across\nthe lawn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man stepped through the wall of shrubbery, called, \"hello!\" and\nwalked toward her.\n\nShe whirled around and stared at him as still as if her heart had\nstopped beating. Then she darted behind the table and waited for him\nthere. Granting the surprise of his appearance, her alarm seemed not\nso much excessive as eerie. As if, the man thought, he were not an\nordinary stranger, but a visitor from another planet.\n\nApproaching closer, he saw that she was trembling and that her breath\nwas coming in rapid, irregular gasps. Yet the slim, sweet, patrician\nface that stared into his had an underlying expression of expectancy\nthat reminded him of the cove. She couldn't have been more than\neighteen.\n\nHe stopped short of the table. Before he could speak, she stammered\nout, \"Are you he?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked, smiling puzzledly.\n\n\"The one who sends me the little boxes.\"\n\n\"I was out sailing and I happened to land in the far cove. I didn't\ndream that anyone lived on this island, or even came here.\"\n\n\"No one ever does come here,\" she replied. Her manner had changed,\nbecoming at once more wary and less agitated, though still eerily\ncurious.\n\n\"It startled me tremendously to find this place,\" he blundered on.\n\"Especially the road and the car. Why, this island can't be more than a\nquarter of a mile wide.\"\n\n\"The road goes down to the wharf,\" she explained, \"and up to the top of\nthe island, where my aunts have a tree-house.\"\n\nHe tore his mind away from the picture of a woman dressed like Queen\nMary clambering up a tree. \"Was that your aunt I saw driving off?\"\n\n\"One of them. The other's taken the motorboat in for supplies.\" She\nlooked at him doubtfully. \"I'm not sure they'll like it if they find\nsomeone here.\"\n\n\"There are just the three of you?\" he cut in quickly, looking down the\nempty road that vanished among the oaks.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I suppose you go in to the mainland with your aunts quite often?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"It must get pretty dull for you.\"\n\n\"Not very,\" she said, smiling. \"My aunts bring me the papers and other\nthings. Even movies. We've got a projector. My favorite stars are\nAntonio Morino and Alice Terry. I like her better even than Clara Bow.\"\n\nHe looked at her hard for a moment. \"I suppose you read a lot?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Fitzgerald's my favorite author.\" She started around the\ntable, hesitated, suddenly grew shy. \"Would you like some lemonade?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe'd noticed the dewed silver pitcher, but only now realized his\nthirst. Yet when she handed him a glass, he held it untasted and said\nawkwardly, \"I haven't introduced myself. I'm Jack Barry.\"\n\nShe stared at his outstretched right hand, slowly extended her own\ntoward it, shook it up and down exactly once, then quickly dropped it.\n\nHe chuckled and gulped some lemonade. \"I'm a biology student. Been\nworking at Wood's Hole the first part of the summer. But now I'm here\nto do research in marine ecology--that's sort of sea-life patterns--of\nthe in-shore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesserich. You\nknow about him, of course?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Probably the greatest living biologist,\" he was proud to inform\nher. \"Human physiology as well. Tremendous geneticist. In a class\nwith Carlson and Jacques Loeb. Martin Kesserich--he lives over there\nat town. I'm staying with him. You ought to have heard of him.\" He\ngrinned. \"Matter of fact, I'd never have met you if it hadn't been for\nMrs. Kesserich.\"\n\nThe girl looked puzzled.\n\nJack explained, \"The old boy's been off to Europe on some conferences,\nwon't be back for a couple days more. But I was to get started anyhow.\nWhen I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich--she's a drab sort of\nperson--said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of\ncourse, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.\"\n\n\"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as\nif she were saying it for the first time.\n\n\"You're pretty shy, aren't you?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\"\n\nThe question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this\nstrangely attractive girl dressed almost like a \"flapper.\"\n\n\"Will you sit down?\" she asked him gravely.\n\nThe rattan chair sighed under his weight. He made another effort to\ntalk. \"I'll bet you'll be glad when summer's over.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"So you'll be able to go back to the mainland.\"\n\n\"But I never go to the mainland.\"\n\n\"You mean you stay out here all winter?\" he asked incredulously, his\nmind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray and great gray waves.\n\n\"Oh, yes. We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are\nvery capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help\nthem.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible!\" he said with sudden sympathetic anger. \"You\ncan't be shut off this way from people your own age!\"\n\n\"You're the first one I ever met.\" She hesitated. \"I never saw a boy or\na man before, except in movies.\"\n\n\"You're joking!\"\n\n\"No, it's true.\"\n\n\"But why are they doing it to you?\" he demanded, leaning forward. \"Why\nare they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe seemed to have gained poise from his loss of it. \"I don't know\nwhy. I'm to find out soon. But actually I'm not lonely. May I tell\nyou a secret?\" She touched his hand, this time with only the faintest\ntrembling. \"Every night the loneliness gathers in around me--you're\nright about that. But then every morning new life comes to me in a\nlittle box.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" he said sharply.\n\n\"Sometimes there's a poem in the box, sometimes a book, or pictures,\nor flowers, or a ring, but always a note. Next to the notes I like the\npoems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,\n\n    'Ah, love, let us be true\n    To one another! for the world, which seems\n    To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n    So various, so beautiful, so new,\n    Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n    Nor certitude--'\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted. \"Who sends you these boxes?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"But how are the notes signed?\"\n\n\"They're wonderful notes,\" she said. \"So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd\nimagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how are they signed?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"Never anything but 'Your Lover.'\"\n\n\"And so when you first saw me, you thought--\" He began, then stopped\nbecause she was blushing.\n\n\"How long have you been getting them?\"\n\n\"Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new\nones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.\"\n\n\"But how does this--person get these boxes to you out here? Does he\ngive them to your aunts and do they put them there?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"But how can they get them in winter?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, pouring himself more lemonade, \"how long is it\nsince you've been to the mainland?\"\n\n\"Almost eighteen years. My aunts tell me I was born there in the middle\nof the war.\"\n\n\"What war?\" he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade.\n\n\"The World War, of course. What's the matter?\"\n\nJack Barr was staring down at the spilled lemonade and feeling a kind\nof terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. Nothing around him\nhad changed. He could still feel the same hot sun on his shoulders,\nthe same icy glass in his hand, scent the same lemon-acid odor in his\nnostrils. He could still hear the faint _chop-chop_ of the waves.\n\nAnd yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape\nglimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to\na sudden focus. For the lemonade had spilled on the headline of the\nnewspaper the girl had tossed down, and the headline read:\n\n                        HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE\n\nUnder the big black banner of that head swam smaller ones:\n\n                    Foes of Machado Riot in Havana\n\n                        Big NRA Parade Planned\n\n                       Balbo Speaks in New York\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly he felt a surge of relief. He had noticed that the paper was\nyellow and brittle-edged.\n\n\"Why are you so interested in old newspapers?\" he asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't call day-before-yesterday's paper old,\" the girl objected,\npointing at the dateline: July 20, 1933.\n\n\"You're trying to joke,\" Jack told her.\n\n\"No, I'm not.\"\n\n\"But it's 1953.\"\n\n\"Now it's you who are joking.\"\n\n\"But the paper's yellow.\"\n\n\"The paper's always yellow.\"\n\nHe laughed uneasily. \"Well, if you actually think it's 1933, perhaps\nyou're to be envied,\" he said, with a sardonic humor he didn't quite\nfeel. \"Then you can't know anything about the Second World War, or\ntelevision, or the V-2s, or Bikini bathing suits, or the atomic bomb,\nor--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" She had sprung up and retreated around her chair, white-faced.\n\"I don't like what you're saying.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No, please! Jokes that may be quite harmless on the mainland sound\ndifferent here.\"\n\n\"I'm really not joking,\" he said after a moment.\n\nShe grew quite frantic at that. \"I can show you all last week's papers!\nI can show you magazines and other things. I can prove it!\"\n\nShe started toward the house. He followed. He felt his heart begin to\npound.\n\nAt the white door she paused, looking worriedly down the road. Jack\nthought he could hear the faint _chug_ of a motorboat. She pushed open\nthe door and he followed her inside. The small-windowed room was dark\nafter the sunlight. Jack got an impression of solid old furniture, a\nfireplace with brass andirons.\n\n\"Flash!\" croaked a gritty voice. \"After their disastrous break day\nbefore yesterday, stocks are recovering. Leading issues....\"\n\nJack realized that he had started and had involuntarily put his arm\naround the girl's shoulders. At the same time he noticed that the voice\nwas coming from the curved brown trumpet of an old-fashioned radio\nloudspeaker.\n\nThe girl didn't pull away from him. He turned toward her. Although her\ngray eyes were on him, her attention had gone elsewhere.\n\n\"I can hear the car. They're coming back. They won't like it that\nyou're here.\"\n\n\"All right they won't like it.\"\n\nHer agitation grew. \"No, you must go.\"\n\n\"I'll come back tomorrow,\" he heard himself saying.\n\n\"Flash! It looks as if the World Economic Conference may soon adjourn,\nmouthing jeers at old Uncle Sam who is generally referred to as Uncle\nShylock.\"\n\nJack felt a numbness on his neck. The room seemed to be darkening, the\ngirl growing stranger still.\n\n\"You must go before they see you.\"\n\n\"Flash! Wiley Post has just completed his solo circuit of the Globe,\nafter a record-breaking flight of 7 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes.\nAsked how he felt after the energy-draining feat, Post quipped....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was halfway across the lawn before he realized the terror into which\nthe grating radio voice had thrown him.\n\nHe leaped for the branch over-hanging the fence, vaulted up with the\nrisky help of a foot on the barbed top. A surprised squirrel, lacking\ntime to make its escape up the trunk, sprang to the ground ahead of\nhim. With terrible suddenness, two steel-jawed semicircles clanked\ntogether just over the squirrel's head. Jack landed with one foot to\neither side of the sprung trap, while the squirrel darted off with a\nsqueak.\n\nJack plunged down the slope to the rocky spine and ran across it, spray\nfrom the rising waves spattering him to the waist. Panting now, he\nstumbled up into the oaks and undergrowth of the first island, fought\nhis way through it, finally reached the silent cove. He loosed the line\nof the _Annie O._, dragged it as near to the cove's mouth as he could,\nplunged knee-deep in freezing water to give it a final shove, scrambled\naboard, snatched up the boathook and punched at the rocks.\n\nAs soon as the _Annie O._ was nosing out of the cove into the cross\nwaves, he yanked up the sail. The freshening wind filled it and sent\nthe sloop heeling over, with inches of white water over the lee rail,\nand plunging ahead.\n\nFor a long while, Jack was satisfied to think of nothing but the wind\nand the waves and the sail and speed and danger, to have all his\nattention taken up balancing one against the other, so that he wouldn't\nhave to ask himself what year it was and whether time was an illusion,\nand wonder about flappers and hidden traps.\n\nWhen he finally looked back at the island, he was amazed to see how\ntiny it had grown, as distant as the mainland.\n\nThen he saw a gray motorboat astern. He watched it as it slowly\novertook him. It was built like a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in\nthe bow and wheel amidship. Whoever was at the wheel had long gray hair\nthat whipped in the wind. The longer he looked, the surer he was that\nit was a woman wearing a lace dress. Something that stuck up inches\nover the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it to\nthe roof of the cabin did it occur to him that it might be a rifle.\n\nBut just then the motorboat swung around in a turn that sent waves\ndrenching over it, and headed back toward the island. He watched it for\na minute in wonder, then his attention was jolted by an angry hail.\n\nThree fishing smacks, also headed toward town, were about to cross\nhis bow. He came around into the wind and waited with shaking sail,\nwatching a man in a lumpy sweater shake a fist at him. Then he turned\nand gratefully followed the dark, wide, fanlike sterns and age-yellowed\nsails.\n\n\nII\n\nThe exterior of Martin Kesserich's home--a weathered white cube with\nnarrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola--was nothing like its\nlavish interior.\n\nIn much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming\nfurniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless\nblack form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack\nthink of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered\nagain how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.\n\nYet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the\nuneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were\nstill those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been\nwatching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.\n\nHe asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named\nMary Alice Pope?\"\n\nThe silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some\nbovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall\ncabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,\nopened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and\nhanded him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked\nin his breath with surprise.\n\nIt was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same\nflat-bosomed dress--flowered rather than white--no bandeau, same beads.\nSame proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.\n\n\"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat\nvoice. \"She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident\nin 1933.\"\n\nThe small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to\nreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the\ngloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with\nwhat seemed a malicious eagerness.\n\n\"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"\n\nWithout a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question--he\nwas much too dazed for that--he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her\nposition on the edge of the sofa.\n\n\"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love\nof Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as\nyou probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he\nfirst came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,\nthere was a cloak of loneliness about him--or rather about the three of\nthem.\n\n\"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud--I\ndon't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a\nservant--and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They\nshowered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't\nrealize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with\nMary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without\nmarrying, he was safe.\n\n\"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred\nBritish stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point\nvery wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did\neverything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was\nafraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani\nand Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But--and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short--her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n\n\"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n\nShe went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well--not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy--\"\n\nJack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n\nMrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n\n\"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n\nShe paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n\n\"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed--to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n\n\"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary--I mean, what had been\nMary--and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n\nA door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n\nThe blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall--a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n\n\"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n\nThe great biologist had come home.\n\n\nIII\n\n\"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n\nJack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n\n\"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n\nThe house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n\nKesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n\n\"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n\n\"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n\nKesserich nodded. \"Suppose--this is just speculation--that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n\nJack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n\n\"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n\nJack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n\n\"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n\n\"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n\n\"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n\nFor a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n\n\"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n\nJack looked at him blankly.\n\n\"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n\n\nIV\n\nMorning sunlight brightened the colors of the wax flowers under glass\non the high bureau that always seemed to emit the faint odor of old\nhair combings. Jack pulled back the diamond-patterned quilt and blinked\nthe sleep from his eyes. He expected his mind to be busy wondering\nabout Kesserich and his wife--things said and half said last night--but\nfound instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as\nif to a farthest island in a world of people.\n\nDownstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet--he\nfelt behind it, but the key was gone--he hurried down to the\nwaterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an\nafterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.\n\nThe sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the _Annie O._ There\nwas eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the\nmast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous\nwith faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.\n\nAfter the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky\nspine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures\nstruck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.\n\nThis time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the\ninnocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd\nbrought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence\nwhen he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.\n\nHe hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the\nsame time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.\n\nThe girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to\nspeak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never\ncome back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've\nbeen watching for you all morning.\"\n\nHe tossed the newspapers over the fence. \"You don't have to read\nthem now,\" he told her. \"Just look at the datelines and a few of the\nheadlines.\"\n\nWhen she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She\ntried unsuccessfully to speak.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You've been the victim of a scheme to make\nyou believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's\n1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why it's been done, though I\nthink I know who you really are.\"\n\n\"But,\" the girl faltered, \"my aunts tell me it's 1933.\"\n\n\"They would.\"\n\n\"And there are the papers ... the magazines ... the radio.\"\n\n\"The papers are old ones. The radio's faked--some sort of recording. I\ncould show you if I could get at it.\"\n\n\"_These_ papers might be faked,\" she said, pointing to where she'd let\nthem drop on the ground.\n\n\"They're new,\" he said. \"Only old papers get yellow.\"\n\n\"But why would they do it to me? _Why?_\"\n\n\"Come with me to the mainland, Mary. That'll set you straight quicker\nthan anything.\"\n\n\"I couldn't,\" she said, drawing back. \"He's coming tonight.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n\"The man who sends me the boxes ... and my life.\"\n\nJack shivered. When he spoke, his voice was rough and quick. \"A life\nthat's completely a lie, that's cut you off from the world. Come with\nme, Mary.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe looked up at him wonderingly. For perhaps ten seconds the silence\nheld and the spell of her eerie sweetness deepened.\n\n\"I love you, Mary,\" Jack said softly.\n\nShe took a step back.\n\n\"Really, Mary, I do.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know what's true. Go away.\"\n\n\"Mary,\" he pleaded, \"read the papers I've given you. Think things\nthrough. I'll wait for you here.\"\n\n\"You can't. My aunts would find you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go away and come back. About sunset. Will you give me an\nanswer?\"\n\nShe looked at him. Suddenly she whirled around. He, too, heard the\n_chuff_ of the Essex. \"They'll find us,\" she said. \"And if they find\nyou, I don't know what they'll do. Quick, run!\" And she darted off\nherself, only to turn back to scramble for the papers.\n\n\"But will you give me an answer?\" he pressed.\n\nShe looked frantically up from the papers. \"I don't know. You mustn't\nrisk coming back.\"\n\n\"I will, no matter what you say.\"\n\n\"I can't promise. Please go.\"\n\n\"Just one question,\" he begged. \"What are your aunts' names?\"\n\n\"Hani and Hilda,\" she told him, and then she was gone. The hedge shook\nwhere she'd darted through.\n\nJack hesitated, then started for the cove. He thought for a moment\nof staying on the island, but decided against it. He could probably\nconceal himself successfully, but whoever found his boat would have him\nat a disadvantage. Besides, there were things he must try to find out\non the mainland.\n\nAs he entered the oaks, his spine tightened for a moment, as if someone\nwere watching him. He hurried to the rippling cove, wasted no time\ngetting the _Annie O._ underway. With the wind still in the west, he\nknew it would be a hard sail. He'd need half a dozen tacks to reach the\nmainland.\n\nWhen he was about a quarter of a mile out from the cove, there was a\nsharp _smack_ beside him. He jerked around, heard a distant _crack_ and\nsaw a foot-long splinter of fresh wood dangling from the edge of the\nsloop's cockpit, about a foot from his head.\n\nHe felt his skin tighten. He was the bull's-eye of a great watery\ntarget. All the air between him and the island was tainted with menace.\n\nWater splashed a yard from the side. There was another distant _crack_.\nHe lay on his back in the cockpit, steering by the sail, taking\nadvantage of what little cover there was.\n\nThere were several more _cracks_. After the second, there was a hole in\nthe sail.\n\nFinally Jack looked back. The island was more than a mile astern.\nHe anxiously scanned the sea ahead for craft. There were none. Then\nhe settled down to nurse more speed from the sloop and wait for the\nmotorboat.\n\nBut it didn't come out to follow him.\n\n\nV\n\nSame as yesterday, Mrs. Kesserich was sitting on the edge of the couch\nin the living room, yet from the first Jack was aware of a great\nchange. Something had filled the domestic animal with grief and fury.\n\n\"Where's Dr. Kesserich?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not here!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Kesserich,\" he said, dropping down beside her, \"you were telling\nme something yesterday when we were interrupted.\"\n\nShe looked at him. \"You _have_ found the girl?\" she almost shouted.\n\n\"Yes,\" Jack was surprised into answering.\n\nA look of slyness came into Mrs. Kesserich's bovine face. \"Then I'll\ntell you everything. I can now.\n\n\"When Martin found Mary dying, he didn't go to pieces. You know how\ncontrolled he can be when he chooses. He lifted Mary's body as if the\ncrowd and the railway men weren't there, and carried it to the station\nwagon. Hani and Hilda were sitting on their horses nearby. He gave them\none look. It was as if he had said, 'Murderers!'\n\n\"He told me to drive home as fast as I dared, but when I got there,\nhe stayed sitting by Mary in the back. I knew he must have given\nup what hope he had for her life, or else she was dead already. I\nlooked at him. In the domelight, his face had the most deadly and\nproud expression I've ever seen on a man. I worshiped him, you know,\nthough he had never shown me one ounce of feeling. So I was completely\nunprepared for the naked appeal in his voice.\n\n\"Yet all he said at first was, 'Will you do something for me?' I told\nhim, 'Surely,' and as we carried Mary in, he told me the rest. He\nwanted me to be the mother of Mary's child.\"\n\nJack stared at her blankly.\n\nMrs. Kesserich nodded. \"He wanted to remove an ovum from Mary's body\nand nurture it in mine, so that Mary, in a way, could live on.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible!\" Jack objected. \"The technique is being tried\nnow on cattle, I know, so that a prize heifer can have several calves\na year, all nurtured in 'scrub heifers,' as they're called. But no\none's ever dreamed of trying it on human beings!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMrs. Kesserich looked at him contemptuously. \"Martin had mastered the\ntechnique twenty years ago. He was willing to take the chance. And so\nwas I--partly because he fired my scientific imagination and reverence,\nbut mostly because he said he would marry me. He barred the doors. We\nworked swiftly. As far as anyone was concerned, Martin, in a wild fit\nof grief, had locked himself up for several hours to mourn over the\nbody of his fiancee.\n\n\"Within a month we were married, and I finally gave birth to the child.\"\n\nJack shook his head. \"You gave birth to your own child.\"\n\nShe smiled bitterly. \"No, it was Mary's. Martin did not keep his whole\nbargain with me--I was nothing more than his 'scrub wife' in every way.\"\n\n\"You _think_ you gave birth to Mary's child.\"\n\nMrs. Kesserich turned on Jack in anger. \"I've been wounded by him,\nday in and day out, for years, but I've never failed to recognize his\ngenius. Besides, you've seen the girl, haven't you?\"\n\nJack had to nod. What confounded him most was that, granting the\nnear-impossible physiological feat Mrs. Kesserich had described, the\ngirl should look so much like the mother. Mothers and daughters don't\nlook that much alike; only identical twins did. With a thrill of fear,\nhe remembered Kesserich's casual words: \"... parthenogenesis ... pure\nstock ... special techniques....\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he forced himself to say, \"granting that the child was\nMary's and Martin's--\"\n\n\"No! Mary's alone!\"\n\nJack suppressed a shudder. He continued quickly, \"What became of the\nchild?\"\n\nMrs. Kesserich lowered her head. \"The day it was born, it was taken\naway from me. After that, I never saw Hilda and Hani, either.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Jack asked, \"that Martin sent them away to bring up the\nchild?\"\n\nMrs. Kesserich turned away. \"Yes.\"\n\nJack asked incredulously, \"He trusted the child with the two people he\nsuspected of having caused the mother's death?\"\n\n\"Once when I was his assistant,\" Mrs. Kesserich said softly, \"I\ncarelessly broke some laboratory glassware. He kept me up all night\nbuilding a new setup, though I'm rather poor at working with glass and\nusually get burned. Bringing up the child was his sisters' punishment.\"\n\n\"And they went to that house on the farthest island? I suppose it was\nthe house he'd been building for Mary and himself.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And they were to bring up the child as his daughter?\"\n\nMrs. Kesserich started up, but when she spoke it was as if she had to\nforce out each word. \"As his wife--as soon as she was grown.\"\n\n\"How can you know that?\" Jack asked shakily.\n\nThe rising wind rattled the windowpane.\n\n\"Because today--eighteen years after--Martin broke all of his promise\nto me. He told me he was leaving me.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nWhite waves shooting up like dancing ghosts in the Moon-sketched,\nspray-swept dark were Jack's first beacon of the island and brought a\nsense of physical danger, breaking the trancelike yet frantic mood he\nhad felt ever since he had spoken with Mrs. Kesserich.\n\nComing around farther into the wind, he scudded past the end of the\nisland into the choppy sea on the landward side. A little later he let\ndown the reefed sail in the cove of the sea urchins, where the water\nwas barely moving, although the air was shaken by the pounding of the\nsurf on the spine between the two islands.\n\nAfter making fast, he paused a moment for a scrap of cloud to pass the\nmoon. The thought of the spiny creatures in the black fathoms under the\n_Annie O._ sent an odd quiver of terror through him.\n\nThe Moon came out and he started across the glistening rocks of the\nspine. But he had forgotten the rising tide. Midway, a wave clamped\naround his ankles, tried to carry him off, almost made him drop the\nheavy object he was carrying. Sprawling and drenched, he clung to the\nrough rock until the surge was past.\n\nMaking it finally up to the fence, he snipped a wide gate with the\nwire-cutters.\n\nThe windows of the house were alight. Hardly aware of his shivering,\nhe crossed the lawn, slipping from one clump of shrubbery to another,\nuntil he reached one just across the drive from the doorway. At that\nmoment he heard the approaching _chuff_ of the Essex, the door of the\ncottage opened, and Mary Alice Pope stepped out, closely followed by\nHani or Hilda.\n\nJack shrank close to the shrubbery. Mary looked pale and blank-faced,\nas if she had retreated within herself. He was acutely conscious of\nthe inadequacy of his screen as the ghostly headlights of the Essex\nbegan to probe through the leaves.\n\nBut then he sensed that something more was about to happen than just\nthe car arriving. It was a change in the expression of the face behind\nMary that gave him the cue--a widening and side-wise flickering of the\ncold eyes, the puckered lips thinning into a cruel smile.\n\nThe Essex shifted into second and, without any warning, accelerated.\nSimultaneously, the woman behind Mary gave her a violent shove. But\nat almost exactly the same instant, Jack ran. He caught Mary as she\nsprawled toward the gravel, and lunged ahead without checking. The\nEssex bore down upon them, a square-snouted, roaring monster. It\nswerved viciously, missed them by inches, threw up gravel in a skid,\nand rocked to a stop, stalled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first, incredulous voice that broke the pulsing silence, Jack\nrecognized as Martin Kesserich's. It came from the car, which was\nslewed around so that it almost faced Jack and Mary.\n\n\"Hani, you tried to kill her! You and Hilda tried to kill her again!\"\n\nThe woman slumped over the wheel slowly lifted her head. In the\nindistinct light, she looked the twin of the woman behind Jack and\nMary.\n\n\"Did you really think we wouldn't?\" she asked in a voice that spat with\npassion. \"Did you actually believe that Hilda and I would serve this\neighteen years' penance just to watch you go off with her?\" She began\nto laugh wildly. \"You've never understood your sisters at all!\"\n\nSuddenly she broke off, stiffly stepped down from the car. Lifting her\nskirts a little, she strode past Jack and Mary.\n\nMartin Kesserich followed her. In passing, he said, \"Thanks, Barr.\" It\noccurred to Jack that Kesserich made no more question of his appearance\non the island than of his presence in the laboratory. Like Mrs.\nKesserich, the great biologist took him for granted.\n\nKesserich stopped a few feet short of Hani and Hilda. Without shrinking\nfrom him, the sisters drew closer together. They looked like two gaunt\nhawks.\n\n\"But you waited eighteen years,\" he said. \"You could have killed her\nat any time, yet you chose to throw away so much of your lives just to\nhave this moment.\"\n\n\"How do you know we didn't like waiting eighteen years?\" Hani answered\nhim. \"Why shouldn't we want to make as strong an impression on you as\nanyone? And as for throwing our lives away, that was your doing. Oh,\nMartin, you'll never know anything about how your sisters feel!\"\n\nHe raised his hands baffledly. \"Even assuming that you hate me--\" at\nthe word \"hate\" both Hani and Hilda laughed softly--\"and that you were\nprepared to strike at both my love and my work, still, that you should\nhave waited....\"\n\nHani and Hilda said nothing.\n\nKesserich shrugged. \"Very well,\" he said in a voice that had lost all\nits tension. \"You've wasted a third of a lifetime looking forward to\nan irrational revenge. And you've failed. That should be sufficient\npunishment.\"\n\nVery slowly, he turned around and for the first time looked at Mary.\nHis face was clearly revealed by the twin beams from the stalled car.\n\nJack grew cold. He fought against accepting the feelings of wonder, of\npoignant triumph, of love, of renewed youth he saw entering the face in\nthe headlights. But most of all he fought against the sense that Martin\nKesserich was successfully drawing them all back into the past, to 1933\nand another accident. There was a distant hoot and Jack shook. For a\nmoment he had thought it a railway whistle and not a ship's horn.\n\nThe biologist said tenderly, \"Come, Mary.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJack's trembling arm tightened a trifle on Mary's waist. He could feel\n_her_ trembling.\n\n\"Come, Mary,\" Kesserich repeated.\n\nStill she didn't reply.\n\nJack wet his lips. \"Mary isn't going with you, Professor,\" he said.\n\n\"Quiet, Barr,\" Kesserich ordered absently. \"Mary, it is necessary that\nyou and I leave the island at once. Please come.\"\n\n\"But Mary isn't coming,\" Jack repeated.\n\nKesserich looked at him for the first time. \"I'm grateful to you for\nthe unusual sense of loyalty--or whatever motive it may have been--that\nled you to follow me out here tonight. And of course I'm profoundly\ngrateful to you for saving Mary's life. But I must ask you not to\ninterfere further in a matter which you can't possibly understand.\"\n\nHe turned to Mary. \"I know how shocked and frightened you must feel.\nLiving two lives and then having to face two deaths--it must be more\nterrible than anyone can realize. I expected this meeting to take place\nunder very different circumstances. I wanted to explain everything to\nyou very naturally and gently, like the messages I've sent you every\nday of your second life. Unfortunately, that can't be.\n\n\"You and I must leave the island right now.\"\n\nMary stared at him, then turned wonderingly toward Jack, who felt his\nheart begin to pound warmly.\n\n\"You still don't understand what I'm trying to tell you, Professor,\"\nhe said, boldly now. \"Mary is not going with you. You've deceived her\nall her life. You've taken a fantastic amount of pains to bring her up\nunder the delusion that she is Mary Alice Pope, who died in--\"\n\n\"She _is_ Mary Alice Pope,\" Kesserich thundered at him. He advanced\ntoward them swiftly. \"Mary darling, you're confused, but you must\nrealize who you are and who I am and the relationship between us.\"\n\n\"Keep away,\" Jack warned, swinging Mary half behind him. \"Mary doesn't\nlove you. She can't marry you, at any rate. How could she, when you're\nher father?\"\n\n\"Barr!\"\n\n\"Keep off!\" Jack shot out the flat of his hand and Kesserich went\nstaggering backward. \"I've talked with your wife--your wife on the\nmainland. She told me the whole thing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKesserich seemed about to rush forward again, then controlled himself.\n\"You've got everything wrong. You hardly deserve to be told, but under\nthe circumstances I have no choice. Mary is not my daughter. To be\nprecise, she has no father at all. Do you remember the work that\nJacques Loeb did with sea urchins?\"\n\nJack frowned angrily. \"You mean what we were talking about last night?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Loeb was able to cause the egg of a sea urchin to develop\nnormally without union with a male germ cell. I have done the same\ntiding with a human being. This girl is Mary Alice Pope. She has\nexactly the same heredity. She has had exactly the same life, so far\nas it could be reconstructed. She's heard and read the same things at\nexactly the same times. There have been the old newspapers, the books,\neven the old recorded radio programs. Hani and Hilda have had their\ndaily instructions, to the letter. She's retraced the same time-trail.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" Jack interrupted. \"I don't for a moment believe what you say\nabout her birth. She's Mary's daughter--or the daughter of your wife\non the mainland. And as for retracing the same time-trail, that's\nsenile self-delusion. Mary Alice Pope had a normal life. This girl has\nbeen brought up in cruel imprisonment by two insane, vindictive old\nwomen. In your own frustrated desire, you've pretended to yourself that\nyou've recreated the girl you lost. You haven't. You couldn't. Nobody\ncould--the great Martin Kesserich or anyone else!\"\n\nKesserich, his features working, shifted his point of attack. \"Who are\nyou, Mary?\"\n\n\"Don't answer him,\" Jack said. \"He's trying to confuse you.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Kesserich insisted.\n\n\"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said rapidly in a breathy whisper before Jack\ncould speak again.\n\n\"And when were you born?\" Kesserich pressed on.\n\n\"You've been tricked all your life about that,\" Jack warned.\n\nBut already the girl was saying, \"In 1916.\"\n\n\"And who am I then?\" Kesserich demanded eagerly. \"Who am I?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl swayed. She brushed her head with her hand.\n\n\"It's so strange,\" she said, with a dreamy, almost laughing throb in\nher voice that turned Jack's heart cold. \"I'm sure I've never seen you\nbefore in my life, and yet it's as if I'd known you forever. As if you\nwere closer to me than--\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" Jack shouted at Kesserich. \"Mary loves me. She loves me\nbecause I've shown her the lie her life has been, and because she's\ncoming away with me now. Aren't you, Mary?\"\n\nHe swung her around so that her blank face was inches from his own.\n\"It's me you love, isn't it, Mary?\"\n\nShe blinked doubtfully.\n\nAt that moment Kesserich charged at them, went sprawling as Jack's fist\nshot out. Jack swept up Mary and ran with her across the lawn. Behind\nhim he heard an agonized cry--Kesserich's--and cruel, mounting laughter\nfrom Hani and Hilda.\n\nOnce through the ragged doorway in the fence, he made his way more\nslowly, gasping. Out of the shelter of the trees, the wind tore at them\nand the ocean roared. Moonlight glistened, now on the spine of black\nwet rocks, now on the foaming surf.\n\nJack realized that the girl in his arms was speaking rapidly,\ndisjointedly, but he couldn't quite make out the sense of the words and\nthen they were lost in the crash of the surf. She struggled, but he\ntold himself that it was only because she was afraid of the menacing\nwaters.\n\nHe pushed recklessly into the breaking surf, raced gasping across the\nmiddle of the spine as the rocks uncovered, sprang to the higher ones\nas the next wave crashed behind, showering them with spray. His chest\nburning with exertion, he carried the girl the few remaining yards to\nwhere the _Annie O._ was tossing. A sudden great gust of wind almost\ndid what the waves had failed to do, but he kept his footing and\nlowered the girl into the boat, then jumped in after.\n\nShe stared at him wildly. \"What's that?\"\n\nHe, too, had caught the faint shout. Looking back along the spine just\nas the Moon came clear again, he saw white spray rise and fall--and\nthen the figure of Kesserich stumbling through it.\n\n\"Mary, wait for me!\"\n\nThe figure was halfway across when it lurched, started forward again,\nthen was jerked back as if something had caught its ankle. Out of the\ndarkness, the next wave sent a line of white at it neck-high, crashed.\n\nJack hesitated, but another great gust of wind tore at the half-raised\nsail, and it was all he could do to keep the sloop from capsizing and\nhead her into the wind again.\n\nMary was tugging at his shoulder. \"You must help him,\" she was saying.\n\"He's caught in the rocks.\"\n\nHe heard a voice crying, screaming crazily above the surf:\n\n    \"Ah, love, let us be true\n    To one another! for the world--\"\n\nThe sloop rocked. Jack had it finally headed into the wind. He looked\naround for Mary.\n\nShe had jumped out and was hurrying back, scrambling across the rocks\ntoward the dark, struggling figure that even as he watched was once\nmore engulfed in the surf.\n\nLetting go the lines, Jack sprang toward the stern of the sloop.\n\nBut just then another giant blow came, struck the sail like a great\nfist of air, and sent the boom slashing at the back of his head.\n\nHis last recollection was being toppled out onto the rocks and\nwondering how he could cling to them while unconscious.\n\n\nVII\n\nThe little cove was once again as quiet as time's heart. Once again the\n_Annie O._ was a sloop embedded in a mirror. Once again the rocks were\nwarm underfoot.\n\nJack Barr lifted his fiercely aching head and looked at the distant\nline of the mainland, as tiny and yet as clear as something viewed\nthrough the wrong end of a telescope. He was very tired. Searching the\nisland, in his present shaky condition, had taken all the strength out\nof him.\n\nHe looked at the peacefully rippling sea outside the cove and thought\nof what a churning pot it had been during the storm. He thought\nwonderingly of his rescue--a man wedged unconscious between two rock\nteeth; kept somehow from being washed away by the merest chance.\n\nHe thought of Mrs. Kesserich sitting alone in her house, scanning the\nnewspapers that had nothing to tell.\n\nHe thought of the empty island behind him and the vanished motorboat.\n\nHe wondered if the sea had pulled down Martin Kesserich and Mary Alice\nPope. He wondered if only Hani and Hilda had sailed away.\n\nHe winced, remembering what he had done to Martin and Mary by his\nblundering infatuation. In his way, he told himself, he had been as bad\nas the two old women.\n\nHe thought of death, and of time, and of love that defies them.\n\nHe stepped limpingly into the _Annie O._ to set sail--and realized that\nphilosophy is only for the unhappy.\n\nMary was asleep in the stern.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Yesterday House, by Fritz Leiber\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK YESTERDAY HOUSE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50905.txt or 50905.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/9/0/50905/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
