No doubt it was a god--but who wasn't?\n\n\nStinson lay still in the sand where he fell, gloating over the success\nof his arrival.\n\nHe touched the pencil-line scar behind his ear where the cylinder was\nburied, marveling at the power stored there, power to fling him from\nearth to this fourth planet of the Centaurian system in an instant.\nIt had happened so fast that he could almost feel the warm, humid\nMissouri air, though he was light years from Missouri.\n\nHe got up. A gray, funnel-shaped cloud of dust stood off to his left.\nThis became disturbing, since there was scarcely enough wind to move\nhis hair. He watched it, trying to recall what he might know about\ncyclones. But he knew little. Weather control made cyclones and other\nclimatic phenomena on earth practically non-existent. The cloud\ndid not move, though, except to spin on its axis rapidly, emitting\na high-pitched, scarcely audible whine, like a high speed motor. He\njudged it harmless.\n\nHe stood on a wide valley floor between two mountain ranges. Dark\nclouds capped one peak of the mountains on his left. The sky was deep\nblue.\n\nHe tested the gravity by jumping up and down. Same as Earth gravity.\nThe sun--no, not _the_ sun. Not Sol. What should he call it, Alpha or\nCentaurus? Well, perhaps neither. He was here and Earth was somewhere\nup there. This was _the_ sun of this particular solar system. He was\nright the first time.\n\nThe sun burned fiercely, although he would have said it was about four\no'clock in the afternoon, if this had been Earth. Not a tree, nor a\nbush, nor even a wisp of dry grass was in sight. Everywhere was desert.\n\nThe funnel of sand had moved closer and while he watched it, it seemed\nto drift in the wind--although there was no wind. Stinson backed away.\nIt stopped. It was about ten feet tall by three feet in diameter at the\nbase. Then Stinson backed away again. It was changing. Now it became a\nblue rectangle, then a red cube, a violet sphere.\n\nHe wanted to run. He wished Benjamin were here. Ben might have an\nexplanation. \"What am I afraid of?\" he said aloud, \"a few grains of\nsand blowing in the wind? A wind devil?\"\n\nHe turned his back and walked away. When he looked up the wind devil\nwas there before him. He looked back. Only one. It had moved. The sun\nshone obliquely, throwing Stinson's shadow upon the sand. The wind\ndevil also had a shadow, although the sun shone through it and the\nshadow was faint. But it moved when the funnel moved. This was no\nillusion.\n\nAgain Stinson felt the urge to run, or to use the cylinder to project\nhimself somewhere else, but he said, \"No!\" very firmly to himself. He\nwas here to investigate, to determine if this planet was capable of\nsupporting life.\n\nLife? Intelligence? He examined the wind devil as closely as he dared,\nbut it was composed only of grains of sand. There was no core, no\ncentral place you could point to and say, here is the brain, or the\nnervous system. But then, how could a group of loosely spaced grains of\nsand possibly have a nervous system?\n\nIt was again going through its paces. Triangle, cube, rectangle,\nsphere. He watched, and when it became a triangle again, he smoothed\na place in the sand and drew a triangle with his forefinger. When it\nchanged to a cube he drew a square, a circle for a sphere, and so on.\nWhen the symbols were repeated he pointed to each in turn, excitement\nmounting. He became so absorbed in doing this that he failed to notice\nhow the wind devil drew closer and closer, but when he inhaled the\nfirst grains of sand, the realization of what was happening dawned with\na flash of fear. Instantly he projected himself a thousand miles away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow he was in an area of profuse vegetation. It was twilight. As he\nstood beside a small creek, a chill wind blew from the northwest. He\nwanted to cover himself with the long leaves he found, but they were\ndry and brittle, for here autumn had turned the leaves. Night would be\ncold.\n\nHe was not a woodsman. He doubted if he could build a fire without\nmatches. So he followed the creek to where it flowed between two great\nhills. Steam vapors rose from a crevice. A cave was nearby and warm air\nflowed from its mouth. He went inside.\n\nAt first he thought the cave was small, but found instead that he was\nin a long narrow passageway. The current of warm air flowed toward him\nand he followed it, cautiously, stepping carefully and slowly. Then it\nwas not quite so dark. Soon he stepped out of the narrow passageway\ninto a great cavern with a high-vaulted ceiling.\n\nThe light source was a mystery. He left no shadow on the floor. A\ngreat crystal sphere hung from the ceiling, and he was curious about\nits purpose, but a great pool of steaming water in the center of the\ncavern drew his attention. He went close, to warm himself. A stone\nwall surrounding the pool was inscribed with intricate art work and\nindecipherable symbols.\n\nLife. Intelligence. The planet was inhabited.\n\nShould he give up and return to earth? Or was there room here for\nhis people? Warming his hands there over the great steaming pool he\nthought of Benjamin, and Straus, and Jamieson--all those to whom he had\ngiven cylinders, and who were now struggling for life against those who\ndesired them.\n\nHe decided it would not be just, to give up so easily.\n\nThe wide plaza between the pool and cavern wall was smooth as polished\nglass. Statues lined the wall. He examined them.\n\nThe unknown artist had been clever. From one angle they were animals,\nfrom another birds, from a third they were vaguely humanoid creatures,\nglowering at him with primitive ferocity. The fourth view was so\nshocking he had to turn away quickly. No definable form or sculptured\nline was visible, yet he felt, or saw--he did not know which senses\ntold him--the immeasurable gulf of a million years of painful\nevolution. Then nothing. It was not a curtain drawn to prevent him from\nseeing more.\n\nThere was no more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stumbled toward the pool's wall and clutched for support, but\nhis knees buckled. His hand slid down the wall, over the ancient\ninscriptions. He sank to the floor. Before he lost consciousness he\nwondered, fleetingly, if a lethal instrument was in the statue.\n\nHe woke with a ringing in his ears, feeling drugged and sluggish.\nSounds came to him. He opened his eyes.\n\nThe cavern was crowded. These creatures were not only humanoid, but\ndefinitely human, although more slight of build than earth people. The\nonly difference he could see at first sight was that they had webbed\nfeet. All were dressed from the waist down only, in a shimmering skirt\nthat sparkled as they moved. They walked with the grace of ballet\ndancers, moving about the plaza, conversing in a musical language with\nno meaning for Stinson. The men were dark-skinned, the women somewhat\nlighter, with long flowing hair, wide lips and a beauty that was\nutterly sensual.\n\nHe was in chains! They were small chains, light weight, of a metal that\nlooked like aluminum. But all his strength could not break them.\n\nThey saw him struggling. Two of the men came over and spoke to him in\nthe musical language.\n\n\"My name is Stinson,\" he said, pointing to himself. \"I'm from the\nplanet Earth.\"\n\nThey looked at each other and jabbered some more.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"Earth. E-A-R-T-H, Earth.\" He pointed upward,\ndescribed a large circle, then another smaller, and showed how Earth\nrevolved around the sun.\n\nOne of the men poked him with a stick, or tube of some kind. It did not\nhurt, but angered him. He left the chains by his own method of travel,\nand reappeared behind the two men. They stared at the place where he\nhad been. The chains tinkled musically. He grasped the shoulder of the\noffender, spun him around and slapped his face.\n\nA cry of consternation rose from the group, echoing in the high\nceilinged cavern. \"SBTL!\" it said, \"ZBTL ... XBTL ... zbtl.\"\n\nThe men instantly prostrated themselves before him. The one who had\npoked Stinson with the stick rose, and handed it to him. Still angered,\nStinson grasped it firmly, with half a notion to break it over his\nhead. As he did so, a flash of blue fire sprang from it. The man\ndisappeared. A small cloud of dust settled slowly to the floor.\n\nDisintegrated!\n\nStinson's face drained pale, and suddenly, unaccountably, he was\nashamed because he had no clothes.\n\n\"I didn't mean to kill him!\" he cried. \"I was angry, and....\"\n\nUseless. They could not understand. For all he knew, they might think\nhe was threatening them. The object he had thought of as a stick was\nin reality a long metal tube, precisely machined, with a small button\nnear one end.\n\nThis weapon was completely out of place in a culture such as this.\nOr was it? What did he know of these people? Very little. They were\nhumanoid. They had exhibited human emotions of anger, fear and, that\nmost human of all characteristics, curiosity. But up to now the tube\nand the chain was the only evidence of an advanced technology, unless\nthe ancient inscriptions in the stone wall of the pool, and the statues\nlining the wall were evidences.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a stirring among the crowd. An object like a pallet was\nbrought, carried by four of the women. They laid it at his feet, and\ngestured for him to sit. He touched it cautiously, then sat.\n\nInstantly he sprang to his feet. There, at the cavern entrance, the\nwind devil writhed and undulated in a brilliant harmony of colors. It\nremained in one spot, though, and he relaxed somewhat.\n\nOne of the women came toward him, long golden hair flowing, firm\nbreasts dipping slightly at each step. Her eyes held a language all\ntheir own, universal. She pressed her body against him and bore him to\nthe pallet, her kisses fire on his face.\n\nIncongruously, he thought of Benjamin back on earth, and all the others\nwith cylinders, who might be fighting for their lives at this moment.\nHe pushed her roughly aside.\n\nShe spoke, and he understood! Her words were still the same gibberish,\nbut now he knew their meaning. Somehow he knew also that the wind devil\nwas responsible for his understanding.\n\n\"You do not want me?\" she said sadly. \"Then kill me.\"\n\n\"Why should I kill you?\"\n\nShe shrugged her beautiful shoulders. \"It is the way of the Gods,\" she\nsaid. \"If you do not, then the others will.\"\n\nHe took the tube-weapon in his hands, careful not to touch the button.\n\"Don't be afraid. I didn't mean to kill the man. It was an accident. I\nwill protect you.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"One day they will find me alone, and they'll kill\nme.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I have not pleased you.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you have. There is a time and place for everything,\nthough.\"\n\nSuddenly a great voice sounded in the cavern, a voice with no\ndirection. It came from the ceiling, the floor, the walls, the steaming\npool. It was in the language of the web-footed people; it was in his\nown tongue. \"No harm must come to this woman. The God with fingers on\nhis feet has decreed this.\"\n\nThose in the cavern looked at the woman with fear and respect. She\nkissed Stinson's feet. Two of the men came and gave her a brilliant\nnew skirt. She smiled at him, and he thought he had never seen a more\nbeautiful face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great, bodiless voice sounded again, but those in the cavern went\nabout their activities. They did not hear.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nStinson looked at the wind devil, since it could be no one else\nspeaking, and pointed to himself. \"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I am Stinson, of the planet Earth.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see it in your mind, now. You want to live here, on this\nplanet.\"\n\n\"Then you must know where I came from, and how.\"\n\n\"I do not understand how. You have a body, a physical body composed\nof atoms. It is impossible to move a physical body from one place to\nanother by a mere thought and a tiny instrument, yet you have done so.\nYou deserted me out in the desert.\"\n\n\"I deserted you?\" Stinson cried angrily, \"You tried to kill me!\"\n\n\"I was attempting communication. Why should I kill you?\"\n\nHe was silent a moment, looking at the people in the cavern. \"Perhaps\nbecause you feared I would become the God of these people in your\nplace.\"\n\nStinson felt a mental shrug. \"It is of no importance. When they arrived\non this planet I attempted to explain that I was not a God, but the\nprimitive is not deeply buried in them. They soon resorted to emotion\nrather than reason. It is of no importance.\"\n\n\"I'd hardly call them primitive, with such weapons.\"\n\n\"The tube is not of their technology. That is, they did not make\nit directly. These are the undesirables, the incorrigibles, the\nnonconformists from the sixth planet. I permit them here because it\noccupies my time, to watch them evolve.\"\n\n\"You should live so long.\"\n\n\"Live?\" the wind devil said. \"Oh, I see your meaning. I'd almost\nforgotten. You are a strange entity. You travel by a means even I\ncannot fully understand, yet you speak of time as if some event\nwere about to take place. I believe you think of death. I see your\nphysical body has deteriorated since yesterday. Your body will cease to\nexist, almost as soon as those of the sixth planet peoples. I am most\ninterested in you. You will bring your people, and live here.\"\n\n\"I haven't decided. There are these web-footed people, who were hostile\nuntil they thought I was a God. They have destructive weapons. Also, I\ndon't understand you. I see you as a cone of sand which keeps changing\ncolor and configuration. Is it your body? Where do you come from? Is\nthis planet populated with your kind?\"\n\nThe wind devil hesitated.\n\n\"Where do I originate? It seems I have always been. You see this\ncavern, the heated pool, the statues, the inscriptions. Half a million\nyears ago my people were as you. That is, they lived in physical\nbodies. Our technology surpassed any you have seen. The tube these\nwebfoots use is a toy by comparison. Our scientists found the ultimate\nnature of physical law. They learned to separate the mind from the\nbody. Then my people set a date. Our entire race was determined to free\nitself from the confines of the body. The date came.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I alone exist. I have searched all the levels of time\nand matter from the very beginning. My people are gone. Sometimes it\nalmost comes to me, why they are gone. And this is contrary to the\ngreatest law of all--that an entity, once in existence, can never cease\nto exist.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStinson was silent, thinking of the endless years of searching through\nthe great gulf of time. His eyes caught sight of the woman, reclining\nnow on the pallet. The men had left her and stood in groups, talking,\nglancing at him, apparently free of their awe and fear already.\n\nThe woman looked at him, and she was not smiling. \"Please ask the Sand\nGod,\" she said, \"to speak to my people again. Their fear of him does\nnot last. When He is gone they will probably kill us.\"\n\n\"As for the webfoots,\" the wind devil, or Sand God, said, \"I will\ndestroy them. You and your people will have the entire planet.\"\n\n\"Destroy them?\" Stinson asked, incredulously, \"all these people? They\nhave a right to live like any one else.\"\n\n\"Right? What is it--'right?' They are entities. They exist, therefore\nthey always will. My people are the only entities who ever died. To\nkill the body is unimportant.\"\n\n\"No. You misunderstand. Listen, you spoke of the greatest law. Your law\nis a scientific hypothesis. It has to do with what comes after physical\nexistence, not with existence itself. The greatest law is this, that an\nentity, once existing, must not be harmed in any way. To do so changes\nthe most basic structure of nature.\"\n\nThe Sand God did not reply. The great bodiless, directionless voice was\nsilent, and Stinson felt as if he had been taken from some high place\nand set down in a dark canyon. The cone of sand was the color of wood\nashes. It pulsed erratically, like a great heart missing a beat now and\nthen. The web-footed people milled about restlessly. The woman's eyes\npleaded.\n\nWhen he looked back, the Sand God was gone.\n\nInstantly a new note rose in the cavern. The murmur of unmistakable mob\nfury ran over the webfoots. Several of the men approached the woman\nwith hatred in their voices. He could not understand the words now.\n\nBut he understood her. \"They'll kill me!\" she cried.\n\nStinson pointed the disintegrating weapon at them and yelled. They\ndropped back. \"We'll have to get outside,\" he told her. \"This mob will\nsoon get out of hand. Then the tube won't stop them. They will rush in.\nI can't kill them all at once, even if I wanted to. And I don't.\"\n\nTogether they edged toward the cavern entrance, ran quickly up the\ninclined passageway, and came out into crisp, cold air. The morning sun\nwas reflected from a million tiny mirrors on the rocks, the trees and\ngrass. A silver thaw during the night had covered the whole area with\na coating of ice. Stinson shivered. The woman handed him a skirt she\nhad thoughtfully brought along from the cavern. He took it, and they\nran down the slippery path leading away from the entrance. From the\nhiding place behind a large rock they watched, as several web-footed\nmen emerged into the sunlight. They blinked, covered their eyes, and\njabbered musically among themselves. One slipped and fell on the ice.\nThey re-entered the cave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStinson donned the shimmering skirt, smiling as he did so. The others\nshould see him now. Benjamin and Straus and Jamieson. They would\nlaugh. And Ben's wife, Lisa, she would give her little-girl laugh, and\nprobably help him fasten the skirt. It had a string, like a tobacco\npouch, which was tied around the waist. It helped keep him warm.\n\nHe turned to the woman. \"I don't know what I'll do with you, but now\nthat we're in trouble together, we may as well introduce ourselves. My\nname is Stinson.\"\n\n\"I am Sybtl,\" she said.\n\n\"Syb-tl.\" He tried to imitate her musical pronunciation. \"A very nice\nname.\"\n\nShe smiled, then pointed to the cavern. \"When the ice is gone, they\nwill come out and follow us.\"\n\n\"We'd better make tracks.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"we must run, and make no tracks.\"\n\n\"Okay, Sis,\" he said.\n\n\"Sis?\"\n\n\"That means, sister.\"\n\n\"I am not your sister. I am your wife.\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\n\"Yes. When a man protects a woman from harm, it is a sign to all that\nshe is his chosen. Otherwise, why not let her die? You are a strange\nGod.\"\n\n\"Listen, Sybtl,\" he said desperately, \"I am not a God and you are not\nmy wife. Let's get that straight.\"\n\n\"But....\"\n\n\"No buts. Right now we'd better get out of here.\"\n\nHe took her hand and they ran, slid, fell, picked themselves up again,\nand ran. He doubted the wisdom of keeping her with him. Alone, the\nwebfoots were no match for him. He could travel instantly to any spot\nhe chose. But with Sybtl it was another matter; he was no better than\nany other man, perhaps not so good as some because he was forty, and\nnever had been an athlete.\n\nHow was he to decide if this planet was suitable for his people,\nhampered by a woman, slinking through a frozen wilderness like an\nIndian? But the woman's hand was soft. He felt strong knowing she\ndepended on him.\n\nAnyway, he decided, pursuit was impossible. They left no tracks on the\nice. They were safe, unless the webfoots possessed talents unknown to\nhim.\n\nSo they followed the path leading down from the rocks, along the creek\nwith its tumbling water. Frozen, leafless willows clawed at their\nbodies. The sun shone fiercely in a cloudless sky. Already water ran in\ntiny rivulets over the ice. The woman steered him to the right, away\nfrom the creek.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStinson's bare feet were numb from walking on ice. Christ, he thought,\nwhat am I doing here, anyway? He glanced down at Sybtl and remembered\nthe webfoots. He stopped, tempted to use his cylinder and move to a\nwarmer, less dangerous spot.\n\nThe woman pulled on his arm. \"We must hurry!\"\n\nHe clutched the tube-weapon. \"How many shots in this thing?\"\n\n\"Shots?\"\n\n\"How often can I use it?\"\n\n\"As often as you like. It is good for fifty years. Kaatr--he is the one\nyou destroyed--brought it from the ship when we came. Many times he has\nused it unwisely.\"\n\n\"When did you come?\"\n\n\"Ten years ago. I was a child.\"\n\n\"I thought only criminals were brought here.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Criminals, and their children.\"\n\n\"When will your people come again?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Never. They are no longer my people. They have\ndisowned us.\"\n\n\"And because of me even those in the cavern have disowned you.\"\n\nSuddenly she stiffened beside him. There, directly in their path, stood\nthe Sand God. It was blood red now. It pulsed violently. The great\nvoice burst forth.\n\n\"Leave the woman!\" it demanded angrily. \"The webfoots are nearing your\nposition.\"\n\n\"I cannot leave her. She is helpless against them.\"\n\n\"What form of primitive stupidity are you practicing now? Leave, or\nthey will kill you.\"\n\nStinson shook his head.\n\nThe Sand God pulsed more violently than before. Ice melted in a wide\narea around it. Brown, frozen grass burned to ashes.\n\n\"You will allow them to kill you, just to defend her life? What\nbusiness is it of yours if she lives or dies? My race discarded such\nprimitive logic long before it reached your level of development.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Stinson said, \"and your race no longer exists.\"\n\nThe Sand God became a sphere of blue flame. A wave of intense heat\ndrove them backward. \"Earthman,\" the great voice said, \"go back to your\nEarth. Take your inconsistencies with you. Do not come here again to\ninfect my planet with your primitive ideas. The webfoots are not as\nintelligent as you, but they are sane. If you bring your people here, I\nshall destroy you all.\"\n\nThe sphere of blue fire screamed away across the frozen wilderness, and\nthe thunder of its passing shook the ground and echoed among the lonely\nhills.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSybtl shivered against his arm. \"The Sand God is angry,\" she said. \"My\npeople tell how he was angry once before, when we first came here. He\nkilled half of us and burned the ship that brought us. That is how\nKaatr got the tube-weapon. It was the only thing the Sand God didn't\nburn, that and the skirts. Then, when he had burned the ship, the Sand\nGod went to the sixth planet and burned two of the largest cities, as a\nwarning that no more of us must come here.\"\n\nWell, Stinson said to himself, that does it. We are better off on\nEarth. We can't fight a monster like him.\n\nSybtl touched his arm. \"Why did the Sand God come? He did not speak.\"\n\n\"He spoke to me.\"\n\n\"I did not hear.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know now. His voice sounds like thunder in the sky, but it is a\nvoice that speaks only in the mind. He said I must leave this planet.\"\n\nShe glanced at him with suddenly awakened eyes, as if thinking of it\nfor the first time. \"Where is your ship?\"\n\n\"I have no ship.\"\n\n\"Then he will kill you.\" She touched her fingers on his face. \"I am\nsorry. It was all for me.\"\n\n\"Don't worry. The Sand God travels without a ship, why shouldn't I?\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"As soon as you are safe. Come.\"\n\nSteam rose from the burned area, charred like a rocket launching pit.\nThey stepped around it carefully. Stinson felt warm air, but there was\nno time, now, to warm cold feet or dwell on the vagaries of Sand Gods.\n\nTogether they crossed the narrow valley. Sybtl led him toward a tall\nmound of rock. Here they came to the creek again, which flowed into a\nsmall canyon. They climbed the canyon wall. Far away, small figures\nmoved. The webfoots were on their trail.\n\nShe drew him into a small cave. It was heated, like the great cavern,\nbut held no walled pool nor mysterious lighting. But it was warm, and\nthe small entrance made an excellent vantage point for warding off\nattack.\n\n\"They will not find us....\"\n\nA high-pitched keening burst suddenly around them. Stinson knew they\nhad heard, or felt the sound for some time, that now its frequency was\nin an audible range.\n\n\"The Sand God,\" Sybtl said. \"Sometimes he plays among the clouds. He\nmakes it rain in a dry summer, or sometimes warms the whole world\nfor days at a time in winter, so the snow melts and the grass begins\nto green. Then he tires and lets winter come back again. He is the\nloneliest God in the universe.\"\n\n\"What makes you think he's lonely?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \"I just know. But he's an angry God now.\nSee those clouds piling in the East? Soon they will hide the sun. Then\nhe will make them churn and boil, like river whirlpools in spring. At\nleast he does this when he plays. Who knows what he will do when he's\nangry?\"\n\n\"The Sand God isn't doing this,\" Stinson said. \"It's only a storm.\"\n\nShe covered his lips with her fingers. \"Don't say that. He may hear you\nand be more angry.\"\n\n\"But it is, don't you see? You give him powers he does not possess.\"\n\nSybtl shook her head and stroked his face with her long, slim fingers.\n\"Poor little God-with-fingers-on-his-feet,\" she said. \"You do not\nunderstand. The Sand God is terrible, even when he plays. See the\nlightning? It is blue. The lightning of a storm that comes by itself is\nnot blue. He is running around the world on feet like the rockets of\nspace ships, and when he strikes the clouds, blue fire shoots away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe clouds continued to build on one another. Soon the blue flashes of\nlightning extended across the sky from horizon to horizon. The earth\ntrembled. Sybtl moved closer, trembling also.\n\n\"He never did this before,\" she said. \"He never made the earth shake\nbefore.\"\n\nGreat boulders crashed down the canyon walls and dropped into the\ncreek. They dared not move from the cave, although death seemed certain\nif they stayed.\n\n\"I'll leave for a moment,\" he said. \"I'll be back soon.\"\n\n\"You're leaving?\" There was panic in her voice.\n\n\"Only for a moment.\"\n\n\"And you won't come back. You will go to your world.\"\n\n\"No. I'll be back.\"\n\n\"Promise? No, don't promise. The promises of Gods often are forgotten\nbefore the sounds die away.\"\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\nHe disappeared at once, giving her no chance to object again, and went\nto the desert of sand, where he had first arrived on the planet. He\nwanted to see if the storm were world-wide.\n\nStinson had never been in a sand storm before, even on Earth. He could\nnot breathe. He could not see. Bullets of sand stung his skin. Bullets\nof sand shot into his eyes. Clouds of sand howled around him. He fell,\nand the wind rolled him over and over in the sand like a tumbleweed.\nThe skirt flew up around his face. He could not get up again.\n\nHe returned to the cave.\n\nSoon after, while they sat huddled together, watching the chaos of\ntumbling rocks, lightning, and driving rain, the high-pitched keening\ncame again. A sphere of blue fire appeared in the east. Its brilliance\nput the lightning to shame. It bore down on the cave swiftly,\npurposefully. Stinson prepared himself to leave. In spite of his desire\nto protect Sybtl, it was useless to get himself killed when he was\npowerless to help her. But at the last moment it veered off.\n\n\"Fiend!\" Stinson screamed the word, vaguely marvelling at his own fury.\n\nThe blue sphere turned and came back.\n\n\"Monster!\"\n\nAgain.\n\n\"Murderer!\"\n\n\"Adolescent!\"\n\nThis time it kept going. The rain and wind ceased. Lightning stopped.\nThunder rumbled distantly. Clouds disappeared. Stinson and Sybtl\nemerged from the cave.\n\nThere was no longer a question of attack from the webfoots, the storm\nhad taken care of that. The fierce sun began its work of drying rocks\nand throwing shadows and coaxing life out into the open again. Down in\nthe canyon a bird sang, a lonely, cheerful twitter.\n\n\"The Sand God is tired,\" Sybtl said. \"He is not angry now. I'm glad.\nPerhaps he will let you stay.\"\n\n\"No. Even if he allowed it, I couldn't stay. My people could never live\nhere with a God who is half devil.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cone of sand suddenly appeared. It stood in the canyon, its base\non a level with the cave. It was quiet. It was dull gray in color. It\nexuded impressions of death, of hopeful words solemnly spoken over\nlowered coffins, of cold earth and cold space, of dank, wet catacombs,\nof creeping, crawling nether things.\n\nThe bird's twitter stopped abruptly.\n\n\"Earthman,\" the Sand God said, as if he were about to make a statement.\n\nStinson ignored him. He glanced down at Sybtl, who sensed that this was\na time for good-bys. He thought, perhaps I can stay here alone with\nher. The webfoots might find us, or the Sand God might destroy us in\none of his fits, but it might be worth it.\n\n\"Don't go,\" she said. \"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Earthman, hear me.\"\n\n\"I hear you.\"\n\n\"Why does your mind shrink backward?\"\n\n\"I've decided not to bring my people here.\"\n\n\"_You_ decided?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Stinson said boldly. \"Call it rationalization, if you\nwish. You ordered us away; and I have several good reasons for not\ncoming here if the door was open.\"\n\n\"I've changed my mind. You will be welcomed.\"\n\n\"Listen to that, will you?\" Stinson said angrily. \"Just listen! You\nset yourself up as a God for the webfoots. You get them eating out of\nyour hand. Then what do you do? You throw a fit. Yes, a fit! Like an\nadolescent. Worse.\"\n\n\"Earthman, wait....\"\n\n\"No!\" Stinson shot back. \"You've owned this planet for a million\nyears. You have brooded here alone since before my people discovered\nfire, and in all those ages you never learned self-control. I can't\nsubject my people to the whims of an entity who throws a planetary fit\nwhen it pleases him.\"\n\nStinson relaxed. He'd had his say. Sybtl trembled beside him. A small\nmammal, round, furry, hopped by, sniffing inquisitively.\n\nSybtl said, \"Is the Sand God happy?\" She shook her head. \"No, he is not\nhappy. He is old, old, old. I can feel it. My people say that when one\ngets too old it is well to die. But Gods never die, do they? I would\nnot like to be a God.\"\n\n\"Stinson,\" the Sand God said. \"You said I was adolescent. You are\ncorrect. Do you remember I told you how my people, the entire race,\nleft their bodies at the same time? Do you imagine all of us were\nadults?\"\n\n\"I suppose not. Sounds reasonable. How old were you?\"\n\n\"Chronologically, by our standards, I was nine years old.\"\n\n\"But you continued to develop after....\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStinson tried to imagine it. At first there must have been a single\nvoice crying into a monstrous emptiness, \"Mother, where are you?\n_MOTHER!_ Where is _everyone_?\" A frenzied searching of the planet,\nthe solar system, the galaxy. Then a returning to the planet. Empty....\nChange. Buildings, roads, bridges weathering slowly. Such a race would\nhave built of durable metal. Durable? Centuries, eons passed. Buildings\ncrumbled to dust, dust blew away. Bridges eroded, fell, decomposed\ninto basic elements. The shape of constellations changed. All trace\nof civilization passed except in the cavern of the heated pool.\nConstellations disappeared, new patterns formed in the night sky. The\nunutterably total void of time--FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS!\n\nAnd a nine-year-old child brooding over an empty world.\n\n\"I don't understand why your development stopped,\" Stinson said.\n\n\"Nor do I. But perhaps ... well, I sense that I would continue, if you\nbrought your people here. You have already taught me the value of\nlife. There is a oneness, a bond that ties each living thing to every\nother living thing. It is a lesson my people never knew. Select any\nportion of this planet that suits you. Take the web-footed woman for\nyour wife. Have children. I promise never to harm you in any way.\"\n\n\"The webfoots?\"\n\n\"You and they shall share the planet.\"\n\nThe Sand God disappeared. Sybtl said; \"Is the Sand God angry again?\"\n\n\"No, he is not angry.\"\n\n\"I'm glad. You will leave now?\"\n\n\"No. This is my home.\"\n\nShe laughed softly. \"You are a strange God.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"I am not a God. Get that through your head.\"\n\nShe drew him into the cave. Her lips were cool and sweet. The cave was\npleasantly warm.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The God Next Door, by Bill Doede\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GOD NEXT DOOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51699.txt or 51699.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/6/9/51699/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
