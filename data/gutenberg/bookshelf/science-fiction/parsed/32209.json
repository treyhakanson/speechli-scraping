Only one person was exempt--himself!_]\n\nHe was just emerging for the hundredth time during the week from the\nfrightening hallucination that had come to plague him, when Kitty\nMurchinsom came into his office.\n\n\"It's almost 15:00, Philip,\" she said.\n\nWhen she had entered, her face had taken on the placid look that\neveryone wore--unwittingly, but inevitably--the instant they came near\nAlcorn.\n\nFinding Kitty's cool blonde loveliness projected so abruptly against the\nbleak polar plain of his waking dream, he knew how much more she was\nthan either fiancee or secretary alone. She was a beacon of reassurance\nin a sea of uncertainty.\n\n\"Thanks, darling,\" he said, and looked at his watch. \"I'd have\nwoolgathered past my appointment and it's an important one.\"\n\nHe stood up. Kitty came closer and put both hands on his shoulders.\n\n\"You've had another of those dreams, haven't you? I wish you'd see a--a\ndoctor about them.\"\n\nHe laughed, and if the sound rang hollow, she seemed not to notice.\n\n\"That's why I asked you to call me. I've made an appointment with one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stood on tiptoe to kiss him. \"I'm glad you're decided. You haven't\nbeen yourself at all for a week, Philip, and I couldn't _bear_ a\nhoneymoon with a preoccupied husband!\"\n\nHe managed the appropriate leer, though he had never felt less like it.\nThe apprehension that followed his daytime chimera was on him again, so\nstrongly that what he wanted most to do was to take Kitty's hand\ntightly, like a frightened child, and run headlong until he was beyond\nreach of whatever it was that threatened him.\n\n\"Small chance,\" he said, instead. \"Any man who'd dream away a honeymoon\nwith you is dead already.\"\n\nShe sighed placidly and turned back to the business at hand. \"You won't\nbe late for your 16:00 conference with our Mr. O'Donnell and Director\nMulhall of Irradiated Foods, will you? Poor Sean would be lost without\nyou.\"\n\nHe felt the usual nagging dissatisfaction with the peculiar talent that\nhad put him where he was in Consolidated Advertising. \"He'd probably\nlose this case without my soothing presence and CA would pay its first\nungrounded refund claim in--\" he counted back over the time he had been\nwith Consolidated--\"four years and eight months.\"\n\nKitty said wistfully, \"Shall I see you tonight, Philip?\"\n\nHe frowned, searching for a way to ease the hurt she would feel later,\nand finding none. \"That depends on the psychiatrist. If he can't help\nme, I may fly up to my cabin in the Catskills and wrestle this thing out\nfor myself.\"\n\nKitty moved to go, and then turned back. \"I almost forgot. There was a\ncall for you at noon from a secretary of Victor Jaffers' at Carter\nInternational. She seemed to know you'd be out and said that Mr. Jaffers\nwould call again at 15:00.\"\n\n\"Victor Jaffers?\" Alcorn repeated. The name added a further premonitory\ndepression. \"I think I know what he wants. It's happened before.\"\n\nWhen Kitty had gone, Alcorn took a restless turn about the room and was\ninterrupted at once by the gentle buzzing of the radophone unit on his\ndesk. He pressed the receiving stud and found himself facing Victor\nJaffers' image.\n\n\"Don't bother to record this,\" Jaffers said without preamble. \"Complete\narrangements have already been made to prove that I've never spoken to\nyou in my life.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJaffers was a small, still-faced man who might have been mistaken for a\nsenior accountant's clerk--until the chill force of his eyes made itself\nfelt. Alcorn had seen the Carter International head before only in\nteleprint pictures, had heard and discounted the stories about the man's\nstudied ruthlessness. But those eyes and the blunt approach made him\nwonder.\n\n\"I've got a place in the contact branch of my organization for your\nparticular talent, Alcorn,\" Jaffers said flatly. \"It will pay you five\ntimes what you earn with Consolidated. You understand why I'm taking you\non.\"\n\n\"I know.\" The arrogance wearied rather than angered Alcorn. \"I have a\ngift for arranging fair settlements when both principals are present.\nMr. Jaffers, I've never exploited my gift for personal profit. That's a\nmatter of self-protection as well as ethics--I don't like trouble.\" He\nreached for the canceling stud to end the interview. \"Others have made\nthe same offer before you and there'll be others again. But I won't use\nmy ability unfairly.\"\n\nJaffers smiled, unamused. \"You do go straight to the point, which saves\nargument. But you'll work for me, Alcorn. Those others made the mistake\nof talking to you personally. I know that you can be reached as easily\nas any other man if my agents keep more than fifty feet away from you.\"\nHis eyes moved past Alcorn to the window. \"Look at the window across the\nstreet.\"\n\nAlcorn, turning, felt his neck prickle. Across the narrow canyon of\nstreet, without pretense at concealing himself, a man in gray clothing\nwatched him from an open office window.\n\n\"I've had you under surveillance for days,\" Jeffers' voice said behind\nhim. \"I've located two others of your sort since my statisticians\nbrought their existence to my attention, but somehow they slipped\nthrough my fingers this week. I'm taking no chances on you.\"\n\nAlcorn whirled back incredulously. \"You've found others? Where and--\"\n\n\"I'll tell you that when you're on my payroll.\"\n\n\"It's a trick,\" Alcorn said angrily. \"I searched for years before I\nsettled down with Consolidated and I didn't find a trace of anybody like\nmyself. I don't believe there are any.\"\n\n\"Most of them covered themselves better.\" Jaffers added, with cold\nfinality, \"I don't haggle, Alcorn. You'll work for me or for no one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The trouble is,\" Alcorn said, \"that I'm different from other people and\nI have to know why. I know _how_ I'm different, but if I knew _why_, I'd\nnever have come to a psychiatrist.\"\n\nDr. Hagen rattled the data sheet in his hands and blinked behind his\npince-nez like a friendly beagle. He was a very puzzled man, being\naccustomed to analyzing his own reactions as well as those of his\npatients. Alcorn could see him struggling to account for the sudden\nserenity that had come over him the instant Alcorn entered the\noffice--certainly it was not the doctor's usual frame of mind, from the\nfirst sour look of him--and failing.\n\n\"Different in what way, Mr. Alcorn?\"\n\n\"I soothe people,\" Alcorn said. \"There's something about me that\ninspires trust and an eagerness to please. Everyone roughly within a\nradius of fifty feet--I've checked the limit a thousand\ntimes--immediately feels a sort of euphoria. They're as happy as so many\nchildren at a picnic and they can't do enough for me or for each other.\"\n\nDr. Hagen blinked, but not with disbelief.\n\n\"It affects psychiatrists, too,\" Alcorn went on. \"You'd cheerfully waive\nthe fee for this consultation if I asked it, or lend me fifty credits if\nI were strapped. The point is that people are never difficult when I'm\naround, because I was born with the unlikely gift of making them happy.\nThat gift is the most valuable asset I own, but I've never understood\nit--and as long as I don't understand it, there's the chance that it may\nbe a mixed blessing. I think it's backfired on me already in one fashion\nand possibly in another.\"\n\nHe shook out a cigarette and the psychiatrist obligingly held a lighter\nto it. Dr. Hagen, Alcorn thought, must normally have been an\nexceptionally strong-willed man, for he hesitated noticeably before he\nspun the wheel.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Actually,\" Alcorn said, \"I've begun to worry about my sanity and I'm\nafraid my gift is responsible. For the past week, I've had a recurrent\nhallucination, a sort of waking nightmare that comes just when I least\nexpect it and leaves me completely unstrung. It's worse than\nrecurrent--it's progressive, and each new seizure leaves me a little\ncloser to something that I'm desperately afraid to face.\"\n\nThe psychiatrist made a judicious tent of his fingers. \"Obviously you\nare an intelligent and conscientious man, Mr. Alcorn, else you would not\nhave contented yourself with your comparatively minor job. But your\nprofession as claims adjustor must impose a considerable strain upon\nyour nervous organization. Add to this that you are a bachelor at the\nage of thirty-three and the natural conclusion--\"\n\nIn spite of his mood, Alcorn laughed. \"Wrong tack--remember my gift!\nBesides, I'm engaged to be married next month and I'm quite happy with\nthe prospect. This trouble of mine is something entirely different. It's\ntied in somehow with my talent for soothing and it scares me.\"\n\nHe could have added that Jaffers' hardly veiled threat on his life\ndisturbed him as well, but saw no point in wasting time on the one\ndanger he understood perfectly.\n\n\"This vision,\" Alcorn said, \"and the sensory sharpness and conviction of\ndisaster that come with it--it's no ordinary hallucination. It's as real\nas my peculiar talent and represents a very real danger. It's working\nsome sort of change in me that I don't like and I've got to find out\nwhat that change is or I'm done for. I _feel_ that.\"\n\nObligingly, the psychiatrist said, \"Describe your experience.\"\n\nTalking about it made perspiration stand out on Alcorn's forehead.\n\"First I'm seized with a sudden sense of abnormally sharpened\nperception, as if I were on the point of becoming aware of a great many\nthings beyond my immediate awareness. I can feel the emotions of people\nabout me and I have the conviction that, in another moment, I shall be\nable to feel their thoughts as well.\n\n\"Then I seem to be standing alone on a frozen arctic plain, a polar\nwasteland that should be utterly deserted, but isn't. I've no actual\nsensations of touch or hearing, yet the scene is visually sharp in every\ndetail.\n\n\"There's a small village of corrugated sheet-metal houses just ahead,\nthe sort that engineers on location might raise, and the streets between\nare packed with snow. Machines loaded with metal boxes crawl up and down\nthose streets, but I've never seen their drivers. Until this morning, I\nnever saw any people at all on the plain.\"\n\nDr. Hagen rattled his paper and nodded agreeably. \"Go on. What are these\npeople like?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you that,\" Alcorn said, \"because their images were not\ncomplete. There seems to be a sort of relationship between them and\nmyself--a threatening one--but I can't guess what it may be. I can't\neven tell you what racial type they belong to, because they have no\nfaces.\"\n\nHe crushed out his cigarette and took a deep breath, getting to the\nworst of it. \"I have a distinct conviction during each of these seizures\nthat the people I see are not ordinary human beings, that they're as\ndifferent from me as I am from everyone else, though not in the same\nway. It's the difference that makes me uneasy. I can feel the urgency\nand the resolution in them, as if they were determined to do--or had\nresigned themselves to doing--something desperately important. And then\nI know somehow that each of them has made some kind of decision\nrecently, a decision that is responsible for his being what he is and\nwhere he is, and that I'll have to make a similar one when the time\ncomes. And the worst of it is that I know no matter which way my choice\nfalls, I'm going to be hideously unhappy.\"\n\nThe psychiatrist asked tranquilly, \"You can't guess what choice it is\nthat you must make, or its alternative?\"\n\n\"I can't. And that's the hell of it--not knowing.\"\n\nThe icy chill of the polar plain touched him and with it came a deeper\ncold that had not been a part of the dream. At that instant, he might\nhave identified its source, but was afraid to.\n\n\"My fear has some relation to whatever it is these people are about to\ndo,\" he said. \"I just realized that. But that doesn't help, because I've\nno idea what it is.\"\n\nHe glanced at his strap watch, and the time made him stand up before the\nlittle psychiatrist could speak again. The hour was 15:57, and he saw in\ndismay that his 16:00 appointment with Sean O'Donnell and the Irradiated\nFoods tycoon would be late.\n\n\"I don't expect an immediate opinion,\" he said. \"You couldn't reach one\nas long as I'm here. Add up what I've told you, and if it makes any sort\nof sense you can radophone me tonight at 19:00. If my apartment doesn't\nanswer, relay the call to my cabin in the Catskills--I've kept the\nlocation a secret, for privacy's sake, but the number is on alternate\nlisting.\"\n\nHe paused briefly at the door, touched with an uncharacteristic flash of\nsour humor. \"And telestat your bill to me. If I asked for it now, you'd\nprobably charge nothing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mood vanished as soon as he was outside and saw the gray-suited\nJaffers operative waiting with stolid patience on the ramp of a\ndepartment store across the street.\n\nThe shock of reminder brought on a giddy recurrence of his\nhallucination.\n\nThe polar plain yawned before him. The silent machines crept over their\nsnow-packed ways, the faceless people stood in frozen groups.\n\nHe emerged from the seizure, shaken and sweating, to find that the\nJaffers man had crossed the street and was waiting a safe distance\nbehind. Alcorn fought down a panic desire to run away blindly only\nbecause Kitty would be waiting for him at Consolidated--Kitty, his\nbulwark of reassurance.\n\nThe gray-suited man was a deliberate hundred feet behind him when he\nboarded a tube-car.\n\nKitty was not in his office and there was no time to ring for her.\n\nInstead, he went through the long accounting room beyond, answering\nautomatically the smiles of a suddenly genial staff and headed for\nO'Donnell's office.\n\nHe saw at once that he was too late.\n\nThe CA manager's door was open and O'Donnell and Mulhall of Irradiated\nFoods were emerging. Both wore street jackets and both men had the\nunmistakable air of euphoric calm that came within seconds of Alcorn's\napproach.\n\nO'Donnell gave Alcorn his familiar long-lipped grin, looking, with his\nthin gentle face and neat brush of ermine-white hair, like an\naristocratic Irish saint.\n\n\"You missed a pleasant meeting,\" O'Donnell said. \"I've just signed a\nrefund release to Charlie here, and a pleasure it was.\"\n\nThe awareness that they had been calmed before he'd arrived left Alcorn\nspeechless.\n\n\"Really shouldn't have accepted,\" Mulhall said sheepishly. Mulhall was a\nbig, solid man, bald and paunchy and, when his normal instincts were\ncontrolled, an argumentative tyrant. \"Niggling technicality, I say.\nShouldn't have taken a refund, but Sean here insisted.\"\n\nThey laughed together, like children sharing a joke.\n\n\"The claim was justified,\" O'Donnell said firmly. \"Once Charlie's\nsecretary explained the case, there was no doubt.\"\n\nMulhall grinned at Alcorn. \"Remarkable girl, Janice Wynn. She's waiting\nin Sean's office. Wants to meet you, Philip.\"\n\nThey went toward the lift with their arms about each other, sharing an\nall-too-brief moment of companionship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlcorn hesitated in front of the closed door of O'Donnell's office.\n\nWhen he entered, Janice Wynn was standing at the window, watching the\nsoundless rush of traffic in the street below. She was dark, not pretty\nin any conventional sense, but charged with a controlled vitality that\nmade physical beauty unimportant.\n\nHer face was anything but serene, the complex of emotions in her tilted\ngreen eyes far removed from the ready placidity he had learned to\nexpect. There was an unmistakable impression of driving urgency--the\nsame urgency, Alcorn thought, that he had felt in the people of his\nwaking dream.\n\n\"You're one,\" he said. His face felt stiff. \"After all these years, I've\nfound another one like--\"\n\n\"Like yourself,\" she said. \"But it's I who have found _you_. Did you\nreally think you were unique, Philip Alcorn?\"\n\nHe tried to answer and couldn't. The meeting he had dreamed of all his\nlife had come about with precisely the electric suddenness he had\nimagined, but he felt none of the elation he had anticipated. He felt,\ninstead, a sudden panic.\n\nFor behind Mulhall's secretary, he had a shutter-swift glimpse of the\nfrozen plain, starkly clear with its huddle of metal buildings and its\nfaceless people clustered on the snow-packed street.\n\nJanice Wynn gave him no time to flounder for control. \"You're the last,\"\nshe said. \"And the most stubborn of the lot. You're lucky that we could\nfind you in the little time we have left.\"\n\nAlcorn said hoarsely, \"I don't know what you mean.\"\n\nShe looked more disappointed than surprised. \"You've no inkling _yet_?\nI've known most of the truth for days, though I still haven't made the\nchange. Your conditioning must have been too thorough or--\"\n\nShe caught the shift of Alcorn's glance toward the window and turned\nquickly. The man in gray was watching them intently from the office\nacross the street.\n\n\"You're under surveillance!\" she said sharply. \"By whom and for how\nlong?\"\n\nHe told her of Jaffers' call, and winced at the sudden dismay in her\nface.\n\n\"At best you've killed an inoffensive psychiatrist with your problem,\"\nshe said. \"At worst--\" She came around O'Donnell's desk toward him, her\nmanner abruptly decisive. \"We've less time than I hoped. Come out of\nhere, quickly.\"\n\nIn the corridor, she opened her handbag and took out a thick white\nenvelope. \"There's no time now for explanations. The clippings will give\nyou an idea of what you're up against. Lose your spy if you can and\ndon't go near your apartment. I'll be at your cabin tonight at 21:00.\nYou'll learn the rest then.\"\n\nShe pressed a stud at the elevator bank and chose an ascending lift.\nAlcorn realized that there would be a turbo-copter waiting for her on\nthe roof.\n\nShe faced Philip before entering the cage. \"You have no chance at all\nexcept with us. Remember that, or you'll regret it for the rest of your\n_very_ short life.\"\n\nAlcorn made no attempt to follow.\n\n\"... except with us,\" Janice Wynn had said.\n\n_Us?_\n\nShe was like himself, gifted with his own talent. She was connected\nsomehow with the faceless people of his hallucinations.\n\nWho were they, and where were they, and what did they want of him?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was still groping for the answers when Kitty came toward him. She\ngave a little cry of dismay when she saw his face.\n\n\"You look simply awful, Philip! Is it another of your--\"\n\nWith Kitty's arrival, Alcorn's premonition of disaster returned.\nSomething was going to happen to him, _was_ happening to him, and unless\nhe moved carefully, it could involve Kitty as well. He had to keep Kitty\nout of this, which meant that he must stay clear of her until he was\nsafe.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" he said hastily. \"I'll call you later, Kitty. I've\nanother appointment now that can't wait.\"\n\nShe put out a hesitant hand. \"Philip....\"\n\nHe wanted desperately to tell her the whole improbable story, to reveal\nhis fears and get the reassurance she was able to give him.\n\nBut he couldn't risk involving Kitty in any danger.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" he repeated. He went down the lift quickly because he\nknew that if he delayed to comfort her, he would never have the courage\nto go at all.\n\nHis only clear thought, as he shouldered his way into the late-afternoon\nthrong outside CA, had been to escape from Kitty and from the too-vivid\nmemory of Janice Wynn. Now that he must choose a course, he was brought\nup short by the fact that, so long as he was tailed by Jaffers' men,\nthere was literally no place for him to go.\n\nHe could not go to his apartment because of Jaffers' surveillance. He\nhad no intention of meeting Janice Wynn at his Catskill cabin at 21:00.\nHer obvious knowledge--and, therefore, _theirs_--of the location ruled\nthat out as a refuge.\n\nHe looked about for the inevitable man in gray and found him following\nat his careful hundred feet. The crowd caught and bore them both along\nlike chips in a millrace, keeping the interval constant.\n\nAlcorn let himself be carried along, feeling the slow release of tension\nthat spread outward from him through the throng. The physical pressure\nwas also eased. People slowed their dogged pace and smiled at utter\nstrangers.\n\nHe had wondered often how the people affected by his circle of calm\naccounted for their sudden change of mood. He had dreamed that one day\nhe might walk in such a crowd and enter another island of serenity like\nhis own and thus find another human being gifted like himself. Someone\nwith his own needs and longings, who would not melt into ready\ncomplaisance when he drew near, but who would speak honestly and\nclearly, who would understand how he felt and why.\n\nIronically, when that moment had come in O'Donnell's office, it hadn't\nbrought him the fulfillment he had expected. It had left, instead, a\npanic beyond belief.\n\nWhy? What was he afraid of?\n\nThere was nothing evil or dangerous in his own gift--why should he fear\nanother possessing the same wild talent? Damn it, he thought, what sort\nof fate could be so terrible that its foreshadowing alone could throw\nhim into such an anxious state?\n\nHow could he be sure that the faceless people were hostile? If they were\nlike Janice Wynn, and if Janice were like himself, it might follow\nnaturally that--\n\nThe rustle of the envelope in his pocket was like an answer, proving\nthat his problem, if nothing else, was real.\n\n\"... for the rest of your _very_ short life,\" she had said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sudden sharpening of awareness that preceded a new seizure rasped\nhim again. He felt the tranquillity about him, and then the arctic\nmontage swallowed it all, and once again he stood bodiless on the\nsnow-packed streets of the metal village.\n\nThe faceless people moved purposefully now, and beyond them loomed the\ntowering bulk of scaffolding erected about the pit where the great\nbronze cylinder of a ship lay....\n\nPit?\n\nScaffolding?\n\nShip?\n\nHe stopped so abruptly that a man behind him stumbled and regained\nbalance only by clutching Alcorn's shoulder.\n\n\"Sorry,\" the man murmured, and moved on.\n\nThe mirage vanished; the crowd behind pushed on, parting politely about\nAlcorn. The mass farther back surged restlessly, hurrying, grumbling\nlike an impatient corporate organism. The Jaffers agent, caught in the\npress, was borne helplessly nearer.\n\nAlcorn realized his opportunity and stood fast, waiting while the tide\nof bodies flowed past. The man in gray saw his intention and struggled\nfrantically to break free of the pinioning crowd.\n\nHe failed.\n\nA sort of grim satisfaction fell upon Alcorn when the man's face lost\nits urgency and settled into smiling unconcern. The gift _was_ a weapon\nof sorts. The way to escape--at least from Jaffers' surveillance--was\nopen.\n\nHe fell in beside the spy, paying less attention now to the man himself\nthan to the matter of disposing of him. The garish facade of a nearby\njoy-bar solved his problem.\n\n\"Come with me,\" Alcorn ordered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe joy-bar was less than half full at this early hour, but noisy enough\nfor midnight. A concealed battery of robotics ground out a brassy blare\nof music, integrating random pitches--selected by electronic\nservo-computers--into the jarring minor cacophony that had become the\nlatest rage.\n\nThe early patrons were intently watching the long telescreen above the\nbar when Alcorn came in. A quarterstaff bout--a frantic, bloody sport\nrevived from God only knew how many centuries before--was in progress\nthere, matching a heavily muscled Nordic with a sandy bristle of hair\nagainst a swarthy, hairless Eurasian. The Nordic, from his twisted\nstance, had a couple of broken ribs already; the Eurasian's right ear\ndangled redly.\n\nAlcorn seated himself opposite Jaffers' operative in an isolated booth\nand fed the coin-slot for drinks.\n\n\"Drink,\" he said grimly. \"You're going to be drunker, my friend, than\nyou've ever been in your inquisitive life.\"\n\nThe uproar died out before the drinks arrived. Only the blaring music\nmachines and the blood-roar of the telescreen remained, and a suddenly\nplacid bartender turned both down to a murmur.\n\nThe rest was routine to Philip Alcorn's experience. Men at the bar\nturned to each other like old friends, forgetting submerged frustrations\nas readily as they forgot the vicious slash-and-parry on the screen. The\nplace drowsed in a slow and comfortable silence.\n\nThe Jaffers man tossed off his drink and dialed another. Alcorn, raising\nhis own, remembered Janice Wynn's letter in his pocket and set the glass\ndown, untasted.\n\nThe clippings, she had said, would give him an idea of what he was up\nagainst.\n\nHis hands shook so violently when he ripped open the envelope that he\nalmost dropped it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEight clippings were inside, small teleprinted scissorings from digest\nnewssheets that were available at any street-corner dispenser. He read\nthem quickly, and was more puzzled than before until he realized that\nthey fell into two general groups of interlocking similarities.\n\nFour were accounts of unexplained disappearances. A moderately\nsuccessful research chemist named Ellis had vanished from the offices of\nhis New York chemical firm; a neighborhood pharmacist in Minneapolis, a\nspinster tea-shop proprietress in Atlanta and a female social worker in\nLos Angeles had disappeared with equal thoroughness, completely baffling\nthe efforts of police to find them.\n\nNone of these people had been of more than minor importance, even in his\nown immediate circle. Alcorn felt that these events had been reported\nonly because the efficiency of missing-persons bureaus made permanent\ndisappearance next to impossible. Even so, only one clipping--that on\nEllis, the New York chemist--bothered to run a photograph.\n\nThe other four accounts dealt with violent deaths, all rising from\nsudden outbreaks of mob hysteria. Two of the victims had been small-town\nclergymen, a profession which made their lynchings as startling as they\nwere inexplicable; both had been respected members of their little\ncommunities until the day--the date was less than a week old--their\ncongregations rose up en masse and tore them limb from limb.\n\nThe remaining two of the second group had died in different fashions. A\ndoctor in a Nevada mining hamlet, making a late call, had been set upon\nby the patient's family, knocked unconscious and shot. A Girl Scout\nleader in Mississippi had been thrown over a cliff by her young charges.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA morbid and pointless collection of horrors, Alcorn thought, until he\nsaw the parallel that related them.\n\nThe circumstances were strikingly similar in every case except that the\nfour who disappeared were urbanites, while the murdered ones were all\nmembers of small and comparatively isolated communities. Not one of the\neight had been over thirty-five; each had been well-liked; none was\nwealthy, yet all were in comfortable circumstances from vocations that\ndepended upon good will.\n\nA further similarity built up in Alcorn's subconscious, but died\nunconsidered because at that moment the quarterstaff bout on the screen\nended and a brazen-voiced announcer gave the time.\n\nIt was 18:30. Dr. Hagen was to call him at his apartment at 19:00.\n\nAlcorn, mulling over the cryptic half-knowledge gained from the\nclippings, wondered what the little psychiatrist might make of it. Hagen\nwas capable in his field; even with so little to work on, he might\npossibly come up with the right answer.\n\nAlcorn decided that he could not run from a danger until he knew what\nthe hazard was. He might as well face the issue squarely now and be done\nwith it.\n\nThe Jaffers operative, on his ninth drink, had relaxed into a smiling\nstupor. Alcorn left him snoring in the booth and headed for the public\nradophone unit beyond the end of the bar. He could not be in his\napartment to take Dr. Hagen's call, but he could anticipate it.\n\nThe telescreen announcer's voice stopped him short. \"_Have you seen this\nman? Sought by police for the murder earlier this evening of Dr. Bernard\nHagen, prominent psychiatrist, he is thought to be at large somewhere in\ndowntown...._\"\n\nThe screen showed an enlarged full-face photograph of Alcorn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was responsible for Hagen's death. But who had wanted the knowledge\nof Alcorn's gift--or the suppression of that knowledge--badly enough to\nkill the psychiatrist for it?\n\nJaffers, or the faceless people behind Janice Wynn?\n\nIt had to be Jaffers, he decided, eliminating a possible source of\nopposition and at the same stroke placing himself still further on the\ndefensive.\n\nSlowly, he became aware that the joy-bar had fallen quiet, that everyone\nin the place was watching him with a sort of intent sympathy. The\nbartender left his place and came toward him, his heavy face a study in\nconcern.\n\n\"We know you couldn't have done it,\" the man said. The sway of Alcorn's\npresence held him hypnotized. \"Can we help?\"\n\nAlcorn's only thought was of flight. \"Have you a turbo-copter?\"\n\n\"On the roof,\" the bartender said. \"It's yours.\"\n\nAlcorn took him along to unlock the controls. On the roof landing, a\ncool evening wind was blowing. There was a dim thin sickle of moon and a\npale haze of stars, a wraithlike scattering of small white clouds that\ndrifted in the reflected spectrum of the city's multicolored glow.\n\nHe sat in the turbo-copter with a feeling of incredulous unreality. The\nvast and shining breadth of the city was spread about him like a\nmonstrous alien puzzle, a light-shot maze without meaning. Where, in\nthat suddenly foreign tangle, could he go?\n\nHe set the 'copter off at random, knowing that its owner would have the\npolice on his heels the moment he recovered volition. Alcorn was still\ntrying to settle upon a course when a seizure fell upon him again.\n\nFirst he had seen the city as something alien; now he felt it, a\nclamorous surf-roar of conflicting individual emotions, an unresolved\nant-hill scurrying of hates and hopes and endless frustrations.\n\nThen he was on the polar plain. The pit and scaffolding were the same,\nbut the enigmatic groupings of people on the streets had changed. Four\nof them had faces now. Three were unfamiliar, but the fourth he\nrecognized as Ellis, the research chemist who had disappeared from his\nlaboratory in New York City.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the time Alcorn was composed, he discovered that he had chosen a\ncourse without conscious intent. Dark, open country fled past beneath,\npricked here and there with racing points of light that marked the main\nartery of northward surface traffic. Familiar mountain shapes loomed\nahead, indicating where he was bound.\n\nHe was heading, lemminglike, for his cabin in the Catskills.\n\nThe knowledge made him wonder if he could trust the instinct that had\ndecided him. Jaffers might or might not know of the cabin; certainly\nJanice Wynn knew, for she had said she would pick him up there at 21:00.\n\nKitty, when he failed to call her as he had promised, would know at once\nwhere he had gone, and would either radophone him or come to him\nquickly.\n\nHe frowned unhappily over the possibilities, caught between an eagerness\nto see Kitty and a dread of having her involved in his trouble. He\nconsidered taking Kitty and fleeing in his borrowed turbo-copter to some\nisolated place where the two of them might make a fresh start, and gave\nup the idea at once as worse than impractical.\n\nJaffers would find him without difficulty, now that he knew what to look\nfor. And there was the progressive reality of his visions--for he had\nceased to think of them any more as hallucinations. The coming of Janice\nWynn and the inexorable sharpening of his awareness proved that reality\nbeyond doubt.\n\nHe found the twin-notched peak that landmarked his cabin. The cool of\nnight and the mountain quiet, when he climbed out, were a tonic to his\nabraded nerves. There was a nostalgic calling of night-birds, the clean\nbreath of pines and, from some tangled rocky slope, the faint pervading\nperfume of wild honeysuckle.\n\nHe had not guessed how sharp his awareness had become until he realized\nthat someone was waiting for him inside the cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe halted outside, feeling like a man just recovering vision after a\nlong blindness. Janice Wynn was in the cabin and she was alone. He knew\nthat as certainly as if he had seen her walk in.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen he went in, she was standing before the wide cold mouth of the\ncabin's fireplace. She wore the same quiet suit she had worn in\nO'Donnell's office, and her tilted green eyes were at once relieved and\nanxious.\n\n\"I was afraid you might have lost your head and run away,\" she said.\n\"It's good you didn't. There wouldn't have been time to find you\nagain--the change is too close on us both.\"\n\n\"Change?\"\n\nShe gave him a disappointed look. \"I thought you'd have guessed by now\nthe relation between ourselves and those people in the clippings. You\nhad another seizure in the 'copter, didn't you?\"\n\nHe stared, too disconcerted to answer.\n\n\"You saw four faces this time,\" she went on, \"where you had seen none\nbefore. And you recognized one.\"\n\n\"It was Ellis, the chemist,\" Alcorn said. And with a numb premonition of\nthe truth, he quietly asked, \"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"You were broadcasting it like a beacon. We're both in the last stages\nof the change. Now that our conditioning is lifting, we're reverting to\nour original telepathic nature. That's how _they_ found you and me, as\nthey found Ellis and the others--by tracking down our communication\nauras.\"\n\nHe said slowly, \"Those four--why were they mobbed and killed?\"\n\n\"Because the change caught them too suddenly for escape,\" she said. \"And\nbecause, in our natural state, we are incompatible with Man.\"\n\n\"With Man,\" he repeated. \"And what does that make us? Supermen or\nmonsters?\"\n\n\"You're still blinded by your conditioning,\" she answered, \"or you'd see\nthat we're neither, that we're not even native to this planet. I don't\nknow a great deal more than that myself--I haven't remembered it all\nyet, because the change isn't complete....\"\n\nShe broke off and, with both hands above the fireplace, gripped the\nrough stone of the mantelpiece. Her tilted green eyes burned with a\ncontradictory play of emotions; the soft planes of her face seemed to\nshift and alter, seeking an impossible balance between ecstasy and\nterror and a tearing, intolerable agony.\n\n\"I'm learning the rest ... now,\" she whispered. \"Sooner than ... I\nthought.\"\n\nHe sensed the change that possessed her, the struggling of new emotions,\nthe shattering of imposed concepts and conditionings and their\nrealigning to shape a new personality, a new person. He knew from that\nmoment that she had been right, and that what he had feared from the\nbeginning of his first seizure was about to happen to him.\n\nShe closed her eyes briefly. When she opened them again, Alcorn drew\nback. Then resentment flared in him and he was suddenly furious, at the\nalteration of status that left him on the defensive.\n\nHe remembered the clippings and understood something of the frustrated\nrage that must have gripped the howling mobs when they killed the two\nministers and the Nevada doctor and the Girl Scout leader.\n\nJanice Wynn straightened from the fireplace, her head tilted as if she\nwere listening to some sound beyond range of his own hearing.\n\n\"Someone is coming,\" she said. Her voice had changed as much as her\nface; her eyes watched him with a remote yet curiously intimate\ncompassion. \"Not our people. It isn't time for them yet.\"\n\nShe was at the cabin door before he realized that she had moved.\n\n\"Stay here,\" she ordered. \"Don't open the door for anyone. For _anyone_,\ndo you hear?\"\n\nShe was gone into the outside darkness.\n\nAlcorn felt it himself then, the indefinable certainty of approach. A\nturbo-copter, then another, slanting down toward his hideaway, two\nspeeding machines filled with grimly intent men--Jaffers' agents.\n\nThe 'copters landed about a hundred yards away from the cabin. There was\na dragging silence and then a booming, amplified voice.\n\n\"Alcorn, come out!\"\n\nHe stood fast, feeling above their tension the swift progress of Janice\nWynn through the darkness toward them. She was close to the nearer\nmachine when he felt a sudden veering of her attention, followed the\ndirection of her probing, and sensed another 'copter angling down out of\nthe night.\n\nHer mental order was as urgent as a shout: _Let no one in. No one!_\n\nShe moved on. The pilot of the third 'copter was only beginning to\nassume identity to Alcorn's sharpened senses when Janice Wynn drew\nwithin effective reach of the nearer grounded machine.\n\nThe amplified voice was calling again: \"Come out, Alcorn, or we'll have\nto--\"\n\nIt broke off short in a scream. There was a flurry of shots, a white\nflash in the darkness and a concussion that shook the cabin.\n\nHe felt Janice turn and run purposefully through the darkness toward the\nsecond 'copter.\n\nThe third machine was dropping in for landing when he identified its\npilot.\n\n\"Kitty!\" he breathed. \"Dear God, Kitty!\"\n\nShe was at the door, the terror and tenderness of her crying\noverwhelming his flinching perception. \"Philip, let me in! Philip\ndarling, are you all right?\"\n\nShe was inside and in his arms before he could prevent it.\n\nShe clung to him frantically until the effect of his presence calmed\nher. The terror went out of her eyes slowly, but the tears glistening on\nher cheeks contradicted her smile of relief.\n\n\"Thank God you're safe, Philip! When I heard on the visinews about Dr.\nHagen--\"\n\nJanice Wynn's silent command was violent in Alcorn's head. _Put her out\nquickly! Do you want her there when your own change comes?_\n\nHe caught Kitty's hands and drew her toward the door.\n\n\"You can't stay here, Kitty. There's no time to explain. I'll call later\nand tell you everything.\"\n\nShe showed her hurt beneath the placidity his gift imposed upon her. \"If\nI must, Philip. But--\"\n\nHe threw open the door. \"Don't argue, Kitty. For God's sake, go!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe blast of the second turbo-copter's explosion might have precipitated\nthe seizure that took him just then.\n\nThe polar plain sprang up about him, more terribly cold and stark than\never, its clustering buildings and metal machines standing out in such\nclear perspective that he was certain he could have put out a hand and\ntouched them.\n\nBut the people were faceless no longer, except for one that knelt before\nthe group in a tense attitude. Janice Wynn stood over that one while its\nfeatures filled in slowly, line by line, growing more and more familiar\nas the face neared identity.\n\nBy the time Alcorn realized that it was his own face, the change was\nfully upon him.\n\nA vast icy wind roared in his ears. A force seized and flung him,\ndistorted and disoriented, to infinity. There was darkness and terror\nand then a chorus of calm voices calling reassurance. Pain gripped him,\nand panic, and finally an ecstasy of remembering that was beyond\nimagining.\n\nDimly, he heard Kitty's screaming. Something struck him furiously on the\nshoulder and he felt his distant physical body struggle automatically\nfor balance.\n\nA second blow caught him on the temple and he fell heavily, his new\nawareness flickering toward unconsciousness. There was a confusion of\nvoices about him and Kitty's raw shrilling died away.\n\nHe lay still, secure in the certainty that he was no longer alone.\n\nMind after mind brushed his, lightly, yet more warming than any clasping\nof hands, and with each touch, he identified and embraced an old friend\nwhose regard was dearer than his own life. He knew who they were. He was\none of them--again.\n\n_It's over_, Janice Wynn's voice said gently. _Do you remember me now,\nFilrinn?_\n\n_Janeen_, he said. He stood up slowly.\n\nHer green eyes stirred with an emotion that matched his own. It was\nincredible that he could ever have forgotten--no matter how thoroughly\nhe had absorbed the protective conditioning--the unity between himself\nand Janeen.\n\n_I remember_, he said. The wonder of it still dazed him. _It's good to\nbe myself again._\n\nShe sighed. _It's good to know why they sent me, instead of one of the\nothers, to bring you back. You remember that?_\n\n\"I remember,\" he said aloud, as if he needed to say the words to make it\ntrue. \"We were together before this assignment for two hundred of these\npeople's years. We'll be together again for hundreds more, now that\nwe're free to go--for when will we ever find another world that needs\nattention as this one needed it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw the Earthgirl then, curled limply on the cabin's sofa.\n\nHer stillness left him alarmed, surprised and ashamed that he should so\nreadily have forgotten an obligation.\n\nHer dishevelment, and the heavy brass fireplace poker on the rug beside\nthe couch, told him the story at once.\n\n_You came just in time, Janeen. Poor Kitty! You didn't hurt her?_\n\nJaneen shook her head. _Of course not, Filrinn. I caught her mind before\nthe shock of your change could derange it and--conditioned her. She'll\nsleep until we've gone, and tomorrow Philip Alcorn will be no more than\na pale memory._\n\n_Either my conditioning still lingers or my empathetic index is too high\n... I'd like her to know the truth about us, Janeen, before we go._\n\nHe knelt beside the couch and smoothed the fair, tousled hair back from\nthe Earthgirl's quiet face.\n\n\"I'm sorry it had to be like this, Kitty,\" he said. He spoke aloud, but\nhis mind touched hers below the level of consciousness. He felt the\nslow, bewildered surge of response. \"It'll help you to forget, perhaps,\nif you know that we came here from a star system you'll never hear of in\nyour lifetime, to study your people and to see what we could do to help\nthem.\n\n\"Alike in form, we are so far apart in nature that you could not have\nborne our real presence, so we buried our real selves under a mask of\nconditioning as deeply as we buried our ship under the ice of your\nplanet's pole. After ten years of study, our conditioning was to lift\nslowly, so that we would realize who and what we were. But you are more\nlike us than we had thought, and with some of us, the conditioning was\ntoo strong to break.\n\n\"It may help to know that your likeness to us will bring our people\ntogether again when the time is right, that your children's children may\nmeet us on equal terms.\"\n\nHe lifted her from the couch and carried her to her 'copter. He set the\nmachine's controls to automatic and stepped back.\n\n\"Good-by, Kitty,\" he said.\n\nJaneen was waiting for him in the cabin.\n\n_The auxiliary shuttle is on its way to pick us up, Filrinn. We'll be\ngone within the hour._\n\nThey stood together, linking their minds, sharing an ecstasy in the\nmeshing of identities that was greater than any physical fulfillment.\n\n_But we have that, too_, Janeen said for his ears alone. And then, to\nthe calm, smiling faces that lingered in the background of their mingled\nconsciousness: _Leave us._\n\nThe faces withdrew and left them--like children just grown to awareness\nof their own marvelous gifts--alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Assignment's End, by Roger Dee\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ASSIGNMENT'S END ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32209.txt or 32209.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/2/0/32209/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
