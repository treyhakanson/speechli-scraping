See\nhttp://craphound.com/place for more.\n\nOriginally Published in Science Fiction Age, March 1998\n\nReprinted in:\n\n\t* Northern Suns\n\t  (Tor, 1999, David Hartwell and Glenn Grant, editors)\n\n\t* Year's Best Science Fiction XVI\n\t  (Morrow, 1999, Gardner Dozois, editor)\n\n\t* Hayakawa Science Fiction Magazine (Japan)\n\t  September 2001\n\n\"Like most aliens-mingling-with-human-society stories, Doctorow's story serves\nmostly to hold a mirror up to human nature, but the odd corner of human nature\nit examines is fascinating, and the story is smoothly and expertly written, with\nsome good detail and local color and some shrewd insights into human nature and\nhuman culture, and an almost Bradburian vein of rich nostalgia running through\nit (although the nostalgia is quirky enough that perhaps it might more usefully\nbe compared to R.A. Lafferty or Terry Bisson than to Bradbury).\"\n\n\t- Gardner Dozois\n\t  Editor, Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine\n\n--\n\nBlurbs and quotes:\n\n* Cory Doctorow straps on his miner's helmet and takes you deep into the\n  caverns and underground rivers of Pop Culture, here filtered through SF-coloured\n  glasses. Enjoy.\n\n\t- Neil Gaiman\n\t  Author of American Gods and Sandman\n\n\n* Few writers boggle my sense of reality as much as Cory Doctorow.  His vision\n  is so far out there, you'll need your GPS to find your way back.\n\n\t- David Marusek\n\t  Winner of the Theodore Sturgeon Award, Nebula Award nominee\n\n* Cory Doctorow is one of our best new writers: smart, daring, savvy,\n  entertaining, ambitious, plugged-in, and as good a guide to the wired world of\n  the twenty-first century that stretches out before us as you're going to find.\n\n\t- Gardner Dozois\n\t  Editor, Asimov's SF\n\n* He sparkles!  He fizzes!  He does backflips and breaks the furniture! Science\n  fiction needs Cory Doctorow!\n\n\t- Bruce Sterling\n\t  Author of The Hacker Crackdown and Distraction\n\n* Cory Doctorow strafes the senses with a geekspeedfreak explosion of gomi kings\n  with heart, weirdass shapeshifters from Pleasure Island and jumping automotive\n  jazz joints.  If this is Canadian science fiction, give me more.\n\n\t- Nalo Hopkinson\n\t  Author of Midnight Robber and Brown Girl in the Ring\n\n* Cory Doctorow is the future of science fiction.  An nth-generation hybrid of\n  the best of Greg Bear, Rudy Rucker, Bruce Sterling and Groucho Marx, Doctorow\n  composes stories that are as BPM-stuffed as techno music, as idea-rich as the\n  latest issue of NEW SCIENTIST, and as funny as humanity's efforts to improve\n  itself.  Utopian, insightful, somehow simultaneously ironic and heartfelt, these\n  nine tales will upgrade your basal metabolism, overwrite your cortex with new\n  and efficient subroutines and generally improve your life to the point where\n  you'll wonder how you ever got along with them.  Really, you should need a\n  prescription to ingest this book.  Out of all the glittering crap life and our\n  society hands us, craphound supreme Doctorow has managed to fashion some\n  industrial-grade art.\"\n\n\t- Paul Di Filippo\n\t  Author of The Steampunk Trilogy\n\n* As scary as the future, and twice as funny. In this eclectic and electric\n  collection Doctorow strikes sparks off today to illuminate tomorrow, which is\n  what SF is supposed to do. And nobody does it better.\n\n\t- Terry Bisson\n\t  Author of Bears Discover Fire\n\n--\n\nA note about this story\n\nThis story is from my collection, \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" published\nby Four Walls Eight Windows Press in September, 2003, ISBN 1568582862. I've\nreleased this story, along with five others, under the terms of a Creative\nCommons license that gives you, the reader, a bunch of rights that copyright\nnormally reserves for me, the creator.\n\nI recently did the same thing with the entire text of my novel, \"Down and Out in\nthe Magic Kingdom\" (http://craphound.com/down), and it was an unmitigated\nsuccess. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the book -- good news -- and\nthousands of people bought the book -- also good news. It turns out that, as\nnear as anyone can tell, distributing free electronic versions of books is a\ngreat way to sell more of the paper editions, while simultaneously getting the\nbook into the hands of readers who would otherwise not be exposed to my work.\n\nI still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age of the\nInternet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is to do basic\nscience: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome. That's what I'm doing\nhere. The thing to remember is that the very *worst* thing you can do to me as\nan artist is to not read my work -- to let it languish in obscurity and\ndisappear from posterity. Most of the fiction I grew up on is out-of-print, and\nthis is doubly true for the short stories. Losing a couple bucks to people who\nwould have bought the book save for the availability of the free electronic text\nis no big deal, at least when compared to the horror that is being irrelevant\nand unread. And luckily for me, it appears that giving away the text for free\ngets me more paying customers than it loses me.\n\nYou can find the canonical version of this file at\nhttp://craphound.com/place/download.php\n\nIf you'd like to convert this file to some other format and distribute it, you\nhave my permission, provided that:\n\n* You don't charge money for the distribution\n\n* You keep the entire text intact, including this notice, the license below, and\nthe metadata at the end of the file\n\n* You don't use a file-format that has \"DRM\" or \"copy-protection\" or any other\nform of use-restriction turned on\n\nIf you'd like, you can advertise the existence of your edition by posting a link\nto it at http://craphound.com/place/000012.php\n\n--\n\nHere's a summary of the license:\n\n\thttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0\n\n\tAttribution.

He was\ntoo good at panning out the single grain of gold in a raging river of\nuselessness for me not to like him -- respect him, anyway. But then he found the\ncowboy trunk. It was two months' rent to me and nothing but some squirrelly\nalien kitsch-fetish to Craphound.\n\nSo I did the unthinkable. I violated the Code. I got into a bidding war with a\nbuddy. Never let them tell you that women poison friendships: in my experience,\nwounds from women-fights heal quickly; fights over garbage leave nothing behind\nbut scorched earth.\n\nCraphound spotted the sign -- his karma, plus the goggles in his exoskeleton,\ngave him the advantage when we were doing 80 kmh on some stretch of back-highway\nin cottage country. He was riding shotgun while I drove, and we had the radio on\nto the CBC's summer-Saturday programming: eight weekends with eight hours of old\nradio dramas: \"The Shadow,\" \"Quiet Please,\" \"Tom Mix,\" \"The Crypt-Keeper\" with\nBela Lugosi. It was hour three, and Bogey was phoning in his performance on a\nradio adaptation of _The African Queen_. I had the windows of the old truck\nrolled down so that I could smoke without fouling Craphound's breather. My arm\nwas hanging out the window, the radio was booming, and Craphound said \"Turn\naround! Turn around, now, Jerry, now, turn around!\"\n\nWhen Craphound gets that excited, it's a sign that he's spotted a rich vein. I\nchecked the side-mirror quickly, pounded the brakes and spun around. The\ntransmission creaked, the wheels squealed, and then we were creeping along the\nway we'd come.\n\n\"There,\" Craphound said, gesturing with his long, skinny arm. I saw it. A wooden\nA-frame real-estate sign, a piece of hand-lettered cardboard stuck overtop of\nthe realtor's name:\n\nEAST MUSKOKA VOLUNTEER FIRE-DEPT\n\nLADIES AUXILIARY RUMMAGE SALE\n\nSAT 25 JUNE\n\n\"Hoo-eee!\" I hollered, and spun the truck onto the dirt road. I gunned the\nengine as we cruised along the tree-lined road, trusting Craphound to spot any\ndeer, signs, or hikers in time to avert disaster. The sky was a perfect blue and\nthe smells of summer were all around us. I snapped off the radio and listened to\nthe wind rushing through the truck. Ontario is _beautiful_ in the summer.\n\n\"There!\" Craphound shouted. I hit the turn-off and down-shifted and then we were\nback on a paved road. Soon, we were rolling into a country fire-station, an ugly\nbrick barn. The hall was lined with long, folding tables, stacked high. The\nmother lode!\n\nCraphound beat me out the door, as usual. His exoskeleton is programmable, so he\ncan record little scripts for it like: move left arm to door handle, pop it,\nswing legs out to running-board, jump to ground, close door, move forward.\nMeanwhile, I'm still making sure I've switched off the headlights and that I've\ngot my wallet.\n\nTwo blue-haired grannies had a card-table set up out front of the hall, with a\nbig tin pitcher of lemonade and three boxes of Tim Horton assorted donuts. That\nstopped us both, since we share the superstition that you _always_ buy food from\nold ladies and little kids, as a sacrifice to the crap-gods. One of the old\nladies poured out the lemonade while the other smiled and greeted us.\n\n\"Welcome, welcome! My, you've come a long way for us!\"\n\n\"Just up from Toronto, ma'am,\" I said. It's an old joke, but it's also part of\nthe ritual, and it's got to be done.\n\n\"I meant your friend, sir. This gentleman.\"\n\nCraphound smiled without baring his gums and sipped his lemonade. \"Of course I\ncame, dear lady. I wouldn't miss it for the worlds!\" His accent is pretty good,\nbut when it comes to stock phrases like this, he's got so much polish you'd\nthink he was reading the news.\n\nThe biddie _blushed_ and _giggled_, and I felt faintly sick. I walked off to the\ntables, trying not to hurry. I chose my first spot, about halfway down, where\nthings wouldn't be quite so picked-over. I grabbed an empty box from underneath\nand started putting stuff into it: four matched highball glasses with gold\ncrossed bowling-pins and a line of black around the rim; an Expo '67\nwall-hanging that wasn't even a little faded; a shoebox full of late sixties\nO-Pee-Chee hockey cards; a worn, wooden-handled steel cleaver that you could\nbutcher a steer with.\n\nI picked up my box and moved on: a deck of playing cards copyrighted '57, with\nthe logo for the Royal Canadian Dairy, Bala Ontario printed on the backs; a\nfireman's cap with a brass badge so tarnished I couldn't read it; a three-story\nwedding-cake trophy for the 1974 Eastern Region Curling Championships. The\ncash-register in my mind was ringing, ringing, ringing. God bless the East\nMuskoka Volunteer Fire Department Ladies' Auxiliary.\n\nI'd mined that table long enough. I moved to the other end of the hall. Time\nwas, I'd start at the beginning and turn over each item, build one pile of\nmaybes and another pile of definites, try to strategise. In time, I came to rely\non instinct and on the fates, to whom I make my obeisances at every opportunity.\n\nLet's hear it for the fates: a genuine collapsible top-hat; a white-tipped\nevening cane; a hand-carved cherry-wood walking stick; a beautiful black lace\nparasol; a wrought-iron lightning rod with a rooster on top; all of it in an\nelephant-leg umbrella-stand. I filled the box, folded it over, and started on\nanother.\n\nI collided with Craphound. He grinned his natural grin, the one that showed row\non row of wet, slimy gums, tipped with writhing, poisonous suckers. \"Gold!\nGold!\" he said, and moved along. I turned my head after him, just as he bent\nover the cowboy trunk.\n\nI sucked air between my teeth. It was magnificent: a leather-bound miniature\nsteamer trunk, the leather worked with lariats, Stetson hats, war-bonnets and\nsix-guns. I moved toward him, and he popped the latch. I caught my breath.\n\nOn top, there was a kid's cowboy costume: miniature leather chaps, a tiny\nStetson, a pair of scuffed white-leather cowboy boots with long, worn spurs\naffixed to the heels. Craphound moved it reverently to the table and continued\nto pull more magic from the trunk's depths: a stack of cardboard-bound Hopalong\nCassidy 78s; a pair of tin six-guns with gunbelt and holsters; a silver star\nthat said Sheriff; a bundle of Roy Rogers comics tied with twine, in mint\ncondition; and a leather satchel filled with plastic cowboys and Indians, enough\nto re-enact the Alamo.\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" I breathed, as he spread the loot out on the table.\n\n\"What are these, Jerry?\" Craphound asked, holding up the 78s.\n\n\"Old records, like LPs, but you need a special record player to listen to them.\"\nI took one out of its sleeve. It gleamed, scratch-free, in the overhead\nfluorescents.\n\n\"I got a 78 player here,\" said a member of the East Muskoka Volunteer Fire\nDepartment Ladies' Auxiliary. She was short enough to look Craphound in the eye,\na hair under five feet, and had a skinny, rawboned look to her. \"That's my\nBilly's things, Billy the Kid we called him. He was dotty for cowboys when he\nwas a boy. Couldn't get him to take off that fool outfit -- nearly got him\nthrown out of school. He's a lawyer now, in Toronto, got a fancy office on Bay\nStreet. I called him to ask if he minded my putting his cowboy things in the\nsale, and you know what? He didn't know what I was talking about! Doesn't that\nbeat everything? He was dotty for cowboys when he was a boy.\"\n\nIt's another of my rituals to smile and nod and be as polite as possible to the\nerstwhile owners of crap that I'm trying to buy, so I smiled and nodded and\nexamined the 78 player she had produced. In lariat script, on the top, it said,\n\"Official Bob Wills Little Record Player,\" and had a crude watercolour of Bob\nWills and His Texas Playboys grinning on the front. It was the kind of record\nplayer that folded up like a suitcase when you weren't using it. I'd had one as\na kid, with Yogi Bear silkscreened on the front.\n\nBilly's mom plugged the yellowed cord into a wall jack and took the 78 from me,\ntouched the stylus to the record. A tinny ukelele played, accompanied by\nhorse-clops, and then a narrator with a deep, whisky voice said, \"Howdy,\nPardners! I was just settin' down by the ole campfire. Why don't you stay an'\nhave some beans, an' I'll tell y'all the story of how Hopalong Cassidy beat the\nDuke Gang when they come to rob the Santa Fe.\"\n\nIn my head, I was already breaking down the cowboy trunk and its contents,\nthinking about the minimum bid I'd place on each item at Sotheby's. Sold\nindividually, I figured I could get over two grand for the contents. Then I\nthought about putting ads in some of the Japanese collectors' magazines, just\nfor a lark, before I sent the lot to the auction house. You never can tell. A\nbuddy I knew had sold a complete packaged set of Welcome Back, Kotter action\nfigures for nearly eight grand that way. Maybe I could buy a new truck. . .\n\n\"This is wonderful,\" Craphound said, interrupting my reverie. \"How much would\nyou like for the collection?\"\n\nI felt a knife in my guts. Craphound had found the cowboy trunk, so that meant\nit was his. But he usually let me take the stuff with street-value -- he was\ninterested in _everything_, so it hardly mattered if I picked up a few scraps\nwith which to eke out a living.\n\nBilly's mom looked over the stuff. \"I was hoping to get twenty dollars for the\nlot, but if that's too much, I'm willing to come down.\"\n\n\"I'll give you thirty,\" my mouth said, without intervention from my brain.\n\nThey both turned and stared at me. Craphound was unreadable behind his goggles.\n\nBilly's mom broke the silence. \"Oh, my! Thirty dollars for this old mess?\"\n\n\"I will pay fifty,\" Craphound said.\n\n\"Seventy-five,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, my,\" Billy's mom said.\n\n\"Five hundred,\" Craphound said.\n\nI opened my mouth, and shut it. Craphound had built his stake on Earth by\nselling a complicated biochemical process for non-chlorophyll photosynthesis to\na Saudi banker. I wouldn't ever beat him in a bidding war. \"A thousand dollars,\"\nmy mouth said.\n\n\"Ten thousand,\" Craphound said, and extruded a roll of hundreds from somewhere\nin his exoskeleton.\n\n\"My Lord!\" Billy's mom said. \"Ten thousand dollars!\"\n\nThe other pickers, the firemen, the blue haired ladies all looked up at that and\nstared at us, their mouths open.\n\n\"It is for a good cause.\" Craphound said.\n\n\"Ten thousand dollars!\" Billy's mom said again.\n\nCraphound's digits ruffled through the roll as fast as a croupier's counter,\nseparated off a large chunk of the brown bills, and handed them to Billy's mom.\n\nOne of the firemen, a middle-aged paunchy man with a comb-over appeared at\nBilly's mom's shoulder.\n\n\"What's going on, Eva?\" he said.\n\n\"This. . .gentleman is going to pay ten thousand dollars for Billy's old cowboy\nthings, Tom.\"\n\nThe fireman took the money from Billy's mom and stared at it. He held up the top\nnote under the light and turned it this way and that, watching the holographic\nstamp change from green to gold, then green again. He looked at the serial\nnumber, then the serial number of the next bill. He licked his forefinger and\nstarted counting off the bills in piles of ten. Once he had ten piles, he\ncounted them again. \"That's ten thousand dollars, all right. Thank you very\nmuch, mister. Can I give you a hand getting this to your car?\"\n\nCraphound, meanwhile, had re-packed the trunk and balanced the 78 player on top\nof it. He looked at me, then at the fireman.\n\n\"I wonder if I could impose on you to take me to the nearest bus station. I\nthink I'm going to be making my own way home.\"\n\nThe fireman and Billy's mom both stared at me. My cheeks flushed. \"Aw, c'mon,\" I\nsaid. \"I'll drive you home.\"\n\n\"I think I prefer the bus,\" Craphound said.\n\n\"It's no trouble at all to give you a lift, friend,\" the fireman said.\n\nI called it quits for the day, and drove home alone with the truck only\nhalf-filled. I pulled it into the coach-house and threw a tarp over the load and\nwent inside and cracked a beer and sat on the sofa, watching a nature show on a\ndesert reclamation project in Arizona, where the state legislature had traded a\nderelict mega-mall and a custom-built habitat to an alien for a local-area\nweather control machine.\n\n#\n\nThe following Thursday, I went to the little crap-auction house on King Street.\nI'd put my finds from the weekend in the sale: lower minimum bid, and they took\na smaller commission than Sotheby's. Fine for moving the small stuff.\n\nCraphound was there, of course. I knew he'd be. It was where we met, when he bid\non a case of Lincoln Logs I'd found at a fire-sale.\n\nI'd known him for a kindred spirit when he bought them, and we'd talked\nafterwards, at his place, a sprawling, two-storey warehouse amid a cluster of\nauto-wrecking yards where the junkyard dogs barked, barked, barked.\n\nInside was paradise. His taste ran to shrines -- a collection of fifties bar\nkitsch that was a shrine to liquor; a circular waterbed on a raised podium that\nwas nearly buried under seventies bachelor pad-inalia; a kitchen that was nearly\nunusable, so packed it was with old barn-board furniture and rural memorabilia;\na leather-appointed library straight out of a Victorian gentlemen's club; a\nsolarium dressed in wicker and bamboo and tiki-idols. It was a hell of a place.\n\nCraphound had known all about the Goodwills and the Sally Anns, and the auction\nhouses, and the kitsch boutiques on Queen Street, but he still hadn't figured\nout where it all came from.\n\n\"Yard sales, rummage sales, garage sales,\" I said, reclining in a vibrating\nnaughahyde easy-chair, drinking a glass of his pricey single-malt that he'd\nbought for the beautiful bottle it came in.\n\n\"But where are these? Who is allowed to make them?\" Craphound hunched opposite\nme, his exoskeleton locked into a coiled, semi-seated position.\n\n\"Who? Well, anyone. You just one day decide that you need to clean out the\nbasement, you put an ad in the _Star_, tape up a few signs, and voila, yard\nsale. Sometimes, a school or a church will get donations of old junk and sell it\nall at one time, as a fundraiser.\"\n\n\"And how do you locate these?\" he asked, bobbing up and down slightly with\nexcitement.\n\n\"Well, there're amateurs who just read the ads in the weekend papers, or just\npick a neighbourhood and wander around, but that's no way to go about it. What I\ndo is, I get in a truck, and I sniff the air, catch the scent of crap and\n_vroom!_, I'm off like a bloodhound on a trail. You learn things over time: like\nstay away from Yuppie yard sales, they never have anything worth buying, just\nthe same crap you can buy in any mall.\"\n\n\"Do you think I might accompany you some day?\"\n\n\"Hell, sure. Next Saturday? We'll head over to Cabbagetown -- those old coach\nhouses, you'd be amazed what people get rid of. It's practically criminal.\"\n\n\"I would like to go with you on next Saturday very much Mr Jerry Abington.\" He\nused to talk like that, without commas or question marks. Later, he got better,\nbut then, it was all one big sentence.\n\n\"Call me Jerry. It's a date, then. Tell you what, though: there's a Code you got\nto learn before we go out. The Craphound's Code.\"\n\n\"What is a craphound?\"\n\n\"You're lookin' at one. You're one, too, unless I miss my guess. You'll get to\nknow some of the local craphounds, you hang around with me long enough. They're\nthe competition, but they're also your buddies, and there're certain rules we\nhave.\"\n\nAnd then I explained to him all about how you never bid against a craphound at a\nyard-sale, how you get to know the other fellows' tastes, and when you see\nsomething they might like, you haul it out for them, and they'll do the same for\nyou, and how you never buy something that another craphound might be looking\nfor, if all you're buying it for is to sell it back to him. Just good form and\ncommon sense, really, but you'd be surprised how many amateurs just fail to make\nthe jump to pro because they can't grasp it.\n\n#\n\nThere was a bunch of other stuff at the auction, other craphounds' weekend\ntreasures. This was high season, when the sun comes out and people start to\nclean out the cottage, the basement, the garage. There were some collectors in\nthe crowd, and a whole whack of antique and junk dealers, and a few pickers, and\nme, and Craphound. I watched the bidding listlessly, waiting for my things to\ncome up and sneaking out for smokes between lots. Craphound never once looked at\nme or acknowledged my presence, and I became perversely obsessed with catching\nhis eye, so I coughed and shifted and walked past him several times, until the\nauctioneer glared at me, and one of the attendants asked if I needed a throat\nlozenge.\n\nMy lot came up. The bowling glasses went for five bucks to one of the Queen\nStreet junk dealers; the elephant-foot fetched $350 after a spirited bidding war\nbetween an antique dealer and a collector -- the collector won; the dealer took\nthe top-hat for $100. The rest of it came up and sold, or didn't, and at end of\nthe lot, I'd made over $800, which was rent for the month plus beer for the\nweekend plus gas for the truck.\n\nCraphound bid on and bought more cowboy things -- a box of super-eight cowboy\nmovies, the boxes mouldy, the stock itself running to slime; a Navajo blanket; a\nplastic donkey that dispensed cigarettes out of its ass; a big neon armadillo\nsign.\n\nOne of the other nice things about that place over Sotheby's, there was none of\nthis waiting thirty days to get a cheque. I queued up with the other pickers\nafter the bidding was through, collected a wad of bills, and headed for my\ntruck.\n\nI spotted Craphound loading his haul into a minivan with handicapped plates. It\nlooked like some kind of fungus was growing over the hood and side-panels. On\ncloser inspection, I saw that the body had been covered in closely glued Lego.\n\nCraphound popped the hatchback and threw his gear in, then opened the driver's\nside door, and I saw that his van had been fitted out for a legless driver, with\nbrake and accelerator levers. A paraplegic I knew drove one just like it.\nCraphound's exoskeleton levered him into the seat, and I watched the eerily\nprecise way it executed the macro that started the car, pulled the\nshoulder-belt, put it into drive and switched on the stereo. I heard tape-hiss,\nthen, loud as a b-boy cruising Yonge Street, an old-timey cowboy voice: \"Howdy\npardners! Saddle up, we're ridin'!\" Then the van backed up and sped out of the\nlot.\n\nI get into the truck and drove home. Truth be told, I missed the little bastard.\n\n#\n\nSome people said that we should have run Craphound and his kin off the planet,\nout of the Solar System. They said that it wasn't fair for the aliens to keep us\nin the dark about their technologies. They say that we should have captured a\nship and reverse-engineered it, built our own and kicked ass.\n\nSome people!\n\nFirst of all, nobody with human DNA could survive a trip in one of those ships.\nThey're part of Craphound's people's bodies, as I understand it, and we just\ndon't have the right parts. Second of all, they _were_ sharing their tech with\nus -- they just weren't giving it away. Fair trades every time.\n\nIt's not as if space was off-limits to us. We can any one of us visit their\nhomeworld, just as soon as we figure out how. Only they wouldn't hold our hands\nalong the way.\n\n#\n\nI spent the week haunting the \"Secret Boutique,\" AKA the Goodwill As-Is Centre\non Jarvis. It's all there is to do between yard sales, and sometimes it makes\nfor good finds. Part of my theory of yard-sale karma holds that if I miss one\nday at the thrift shops, that'll be the day they put out the big score. So I hit\nthe stores diligently and came up with crapola. I had offended the fates, I\nknew, and wouldn't make another score until I placated them. It was lonely work,\nstill and all, and I missed Craphound's good eye and obsessive delight.\n\nI was at the cash-register with a few items at the Goodwill when a guy in a suit\nbehind me tapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\"Sorry to bother you,\" he said. His suit looked expensive, as did his manicure\nand his haircut and his wire-rimmed glasses. \"I was just wondering where you\nfound that.\" He gestured at a rhinestone-studded ukelele, with a cowboy hat\nwood-burned into the body. I had picked it up with a guilty little thrill,\nthinking that Craphound might buy it at the next auction.\n\n\"Second floor, in the toy section.\"\n\n\"There wasn't anything else like it, was there?\"\n\n\"'Fraid not,\" I said, and the cashier picked it up and started wrapping it in\nnewspaper.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said, and he looked like a little kid who'd just been told that he\ncouldn't have a puppy. \"I don't suppose you'd want to sell it, would you?\"\n\nI held up a hand and waited while the cashier bagged it with the rest of my\nstuff, a few old clothbound novels I thought I could sell at a used book-store,\nand a Grease belt-buckle with Olivia Newton John on it. I led him out the door\nby the elbow of his expensive suit.\n\n\"How much?\" I had paid a dollar.\n\n\"Ten bucks?\"\n\nI nearly said, \"Sold!\" but I caught myself. \"Twenty.\"\n\n\"Twenty dollars?\"\n\n\"That's what they'd charge at a boutique on Queen Street.\"\n\nHe took out a slim leather wallet and produced a twenty. I handed him the uke.\nHis face lit up like a lightbulb.\n\n#\n\nIt's not that my adulthood is particularly unhappy. Likewise, it's not that my\nchildhood was particularly happy.\n\nThere are memories I have, though, that are like a cool drink of water. My\ngrandfather's place near Milton, an old Victorian farmhouse, where the cat drank\nout of a milk-glass bowl; and where we sat around a rough pine table as big as\nmy whole apartment; and where my playroom was the draughty barn with hay-filled\nlofts bulging with farm junk and Tarzan-ropes.\n\nThere was Grampa's friend Fyodor, and we spent every evening at his\nwrecking-yard, he and Grampa talking and smoking while I scampered in the\ntwilight, scaling mountains of auto-junk. The glove-boxes yielded treasures:\ncrumpled photos of college boys mugging in front of signs, roadmaps of far-away\nplaces. I found a guidebook from the 1964 New York World's Fair once, and a\nlipstick like a chrome bullet, and a pair of white leather ladies' gloves.\n\nFyodor dealt in scrap, too, and once, he had half of a carny carousel, a few\nhorses and part of the canopy, paint flaking and sharp torn edges protruding;\nnext to it, a Korean-war tank minus its turret and treads, and inside the tank\nwere peeling old pinup girls and a rotation schedule and a crude Kilroy. The\ncontrol-room in the middle of the carousel had a stack of paperback sci-fi\nnovels, Ace Doubles that had two books bound back-to-back, and when you finished\nthe first, you turned it over and read the other. Fyodor let me keep them, and\nthere was a pawn-ticket in one from Macon, Georgia, for a transistor radio.\n\nMy parents started leaving me alone when I was fourteen and I couldn't keep from\nsneaking into their room and snooping. Mom's jewelry box had books of matches\nfrom their honeymoon in Acapulco, printed with bad palm-trees. My Dad kept an\nold photo in his sock drawer, of himself on muscle-beach, shirtless, flexing his\nbiceps.\n\nMy grandmother saved every scrap of my mother's life in her basement, in dusty\nArmy trunks. I entertained myself by pulling it out and taking it in: her Mouse\nEars from the big family train-trip to Disneyland in '57, and her records, and\nthe glittery pasteboard sign from her sweet sixteen. There were well-chewed\nstuffed animals, and school exercise books in which she'd practiced variations\non her signature for page after page.\n\nIt all told a story. The penciled Kilroy in the tank made me see one of those\nCanadian soldiers in Korea, unshaven and crew-cut like an extra on M*A*S*H,\nsitting for bored hour after hour, staring at the pinup girls, fiddling with a\ncrossword, finally laying it down and sketching his Kilroy quickly, before\nanyone saw.\n\nThe photo of my Dad posing sent me whirling through time to Toronto's Muscle\nBeach in the east end, and hearing the tinny AM radios playing weird psychedelic\nrock while teenagers lounged on their Mustangs and the girls sunbathed in\nbikinis that made their tits into torpedoes.\n\nIt all made poems. The old pulp novels and the pawn ticket, when I spread them\nout in front of the TV, and arranged them just so, they made up a poem that took\nmy breath away.\n\n#\n\nAfter the cowboy trunk episode, I didn't run into Craphound again until the\nannual Rotary Club charity rummage sale at the Upper Canada Brewing Company. He\nwas wearing the cowboy hat, sixguns and the silver star from the cowboy trunk.\nIt should have looked ridiculous, but the net effect was naive and somehow\ncharming, like he was a little boy whose hair you wanted to muss.\n\nI found a box of nice old melamine dishes, in various shades of green -- four\nsquare plates, bowls, salad-plates, and a serving tray. I threw them in the\nduffel-bag I'd brought and kept browsing, ignoring Craphound as he charmed a\nsalty old Rotarian while fondling a box of leather-bound books.\n\nI browsed a stack of old Ministry of Labour licenses -- barber, chiropodist,\nbartender, watchmaker. They all had pretty seals and were framed in stark green\ninstitutional metal. They all had different names, but all from one family, and\nI made up a little story to entertain myself, about the proud mother saving her\nsons' accreditations and framing hanging them in the spare room with their\ndiplomas. \"Oh, George Junior's just opened his own barbershop, and little\nJimmy's still fixing watches. . .\"\n\nI bought them.\n\nIn a box of crappy plastic Little Ponies and Barbies and Care Bears, I found a\nleather Indian headdress, a wooden bow-and-arrow set, and a fringed buckskin\nvest. Craphound was still buttering up the leather books' owner. I bought them\nquick, for five bucks.\n\n\"Those are beautiful,\" a voice said at my elbow. I turned around and smiled at\nthe snappy dresser who'd bought the uke at the Secret Boutique. He'd gone casual\nfor the weekend, in an expensive, L.L. Bean button-down way.\n\n\"Aren't they, though.\"\n\n\"You sell them on Queen Street? Your finds, I mean?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. Sometimes at auction. How's the uke?\"\n\n\"Oh, I got it all tuned up,\" he said, and smiled the same smile he'd given me\nwhen he'd taken hold of it at Goodwill. \"I can play 'Don't Fence Me In' on it.\"\nHe looked at his feet. \"Silly, huh?\"\n\n\"Not at all. You're into cowboy things, huh?\" As I said it, I was overcome with\nthe knowledge that this was \"Billy the Kid,\" the original owner of the cowboy\ntrunk. I don't know why I felt that way, but I did, with utter certainty.\n\n\"Just trying to re-live a piece of my childhood, I guess. I'm Scott,\" he said,\nextending his hand.\n\n_Scott?_ I thought wildly. _Maybe it's his middle name?_ \"I'm Jerry.\"\n\nThe Upper Canada Brewery sale has many things going for it, including a beer\ngarden where you can sample their wares and get a good BBQ burger. We gently\ngravitated to it, looking over the tables as we went.\n\n\"You're a pro, right?\" he asked after we had plastic cups of beer.\n\n\"You could say that.\"\n\n\"I'm an amateur. A rank amateur. Any words of wisdom?\"\n\nI laughed and drank some beer, lit a cigarette. \"There's no secret to it, I\nthink. Just diligence: you've got to go out every chance you get, or you'll miss\nthe big score.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"I hear that. Sometimes, I'll be sitting in my office, and I'll\njust _know_ that they're putting out a piece of pure gold at the Goodwill and\nthat someone else will get to it before my lunch. I get so wound up, I'm no good\nuntil I go down there and hunt for it. I guess I'm hooked, eh?\"\n\n\"Cheaper than some other kinds of addictions.\"\n\n\"I guess so. About that Indian stuff -- what do you figure you'd get for it at a\nQueen Street boutique?\"\n\nI looked him in the eye. He may have been something high-powered and cool and\ncollected in his natural environment, but just then, he was as eager and nervous\nas a kitchen-table poker-player at a high-stakes game.\n\n\"Maybe fifty bucks,\" I said.\n\n\"Fifty, huh?\" he asked.\n\n\"About that,\" I said.\n\n\"Once it sold,\" he said.\n\n\"There is that,\" I said.\n\n\"Might take a month, might take a year,\" he said.\n\n\"Might take a day,\" I said.\n\n\"It might, it might.\" He finished his beer. \"I don't suppose you'd take forty?\"\n\nI'd paid five for it, not ten minutes before. It looked like it would fit\nCraphound, who, after all, was wearing Scott/Billy's own boyhood treasures as we\nspoke. You don't make a living by feeling guilty over eight hundred percent\nmarkups. Still, I'd angered the fates, and needed to redeem myself.\n\n\"Make it five,\" I said.\n\nHe started to say something, then closed his mouth and gave me a look of thanks.\nHe took a five out of his wallet and handed it to me. I pulled the vest and bow\nand headdress out my duffel.\n\nHe walked back to a shiny black Jeep with gold detail work, parked next to\nCraphound's van. Craphound was building onto the Lego body, and the hood had a\nminiature Lego town attached to it.\n\nCraphound looked around as he passed, and leaned forward with undisguised\ninterest at the booty. I grimaced and finished my beer.\n\n#\n\nI met Scott/Billy three times more at the Secret Boutique that week.\n\nHe was a lawyer, who specialised in alien-technology patents. He had a practice\non Bay Street, with two partners, and despite his youth, he was the senior man.\n\nI didn't let on that I knew about Billy the Kid and his mother in the East\nMuskoka Volunteer Fire Department Ladies' Auxiliary. But I felt a bond with him,\nas though we shared an unspoken secret. I pulled any cowboy finds for him, and\nhe developed a pretty good eye for what I was after and returned the favour.\n\nThe fates were with me again, and no two ways about it. I took home a ratty old\nOriental rug that on closer inspection was a 19th century hand-knotted Persian;\nan upholstered Turkish footstool; a collection of hand-painted silk Hawaiiana\npillows and a carved Meerschaum pipe. Scott/Billy found the last for me, and it\ncost me two dollars. I knew a collector who would pay thirty in an eye-blink,\nand from then on, as far as I was concerned, Scott/Billy was a fellow craphound.\n\n\"You going to the auction tomorrow night?\" I asked him at the checkout line.\n\n\"Wouldn't miss it,\" he said. He'd barely been able to contain his excitement\nwhen I told him about the Thursday night auctions and the bargains to be had\nthere. He sure had the bug.\n\n\"Want to get together for dinner beforehand? The Rotterdam's got a good patio.\"\n\nHe did, and we did, and I had a glass of framboise that packed a hell of a kick\nand tasted like fizzy raspberry lemonade; and doorstopper fries and a club\nsandwich.\n\nI had my nose in my glass when he kicked my ankle under the table. \"Look at\nthat!\"\n\nIt was Craphound in his van, cruising for a parking spot. The Lego village had\nbeen joined by a whole postmodern spaceport on the roof, with a red-and-blue\ncastle, a football-sized flying saucer, and a clown's head with blinking eyes.\n\nI went back to my drink and tried to get my appetite back.\n\n\"Was that an extee driving?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Used to be a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"He's a picker?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" I turned back to my fries and tried to kill the subject.\n\n\"Do you know how he made his stake?\"\n\n\"The chlorophyll thing, in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n\"Sweet!\" he said. \"Very sweet. I've got a client who's got some secondary\npatents from that one. What's he go after?\"\n\n\"Oh, pretty much everything,\" I said, resigning myself to discussing the topic\nafter all. \"But lately, the same as you -- cowboys and Injuns.\"\n\nHe laughed and smacked his knee. \"Well, what do you know? What could he possibly\nwant with the stuff?\"\n\n\"What do they want with any of it? He got started one day when we were cruising\nthe Muskokas,\" I said carefully, watching his face. \"Found a trunk of old cowboy\nthings at a rummage sale. East Muskoka Volunteer Fire Department Ladies'\nAuxiliary.\" I waited for him to shout or startle. He didn't.\n\n\"Yeah? A good find, I guess. Wish I'd made it.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say to that, so I took a bite of my sandwich.\n\nScott continued. \"I think about what they get out of it a lot. There's nothing\nwe have here that they couldn't make for themselves. I mean, if they picked up\nand left today, we'd still be making sense of everything they gave us in a\nhundred years. You know, I just closed a deal for a biochemical computer that's\nno-shit 10,000 times faster than anything we've built out of silicon. You know\nwhat the extee took in trade? Title to a defunct fairground outside of Calgary\n-- they shut it down ten years ago because the midway was too unsafe to ride.\nDoesn't that beat all? This thing is worth a billion dollars right out of the\ngate, I mean, within twenty-four hours of the deal closing, the seller can turn\nit into the GDP of Bolivia. For a crummy real-estate dog that you couldn't get\nfive grand for!\"\n\nIt always shocked me when Billy/Scott talked about his job -- it was easy to\nforget that he was a high-powered lawyer when we were jawing and fooling around\nlike old craphounds. I wondered if maybe he _wasn't_ Billy the Kid; I couldn't\nthink of any reason for him to be playing it all so close to his chest.\n\n\"What the hell is some extee going to do with a fairground?\"\n\n#\n\nCraphound got a free Coke from Lisa at the check-in when he made his appearance.\nHe bid high, but shrewdly, and never pulled ten-thousand-dollar stunts. The\nbidders were wandering the floor, previewing that week's stock, and making notes\nto themselves.\n\nI rooted through a box-lot full of old tins, and found one with a buckaroo at\nthe Calgary Stampede, riding a bucking bronc. I picked it up and stood to\ninspect it. Craphound was behind me.\n\n\"Nice piece, huh?\" I said to him.\n\n\"I like it very much,\" Craphound said, and I felt my cheeks flush.\n\n\"You're going to have some competition tonight, I think,\" I said, and nodded at\nScott/Billy. \"I think he's Billy; the one whose mother sold us -- you -- the\ncowboy trunk.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Craphound said, and it felt like we were partners again, scoping out\nthe competition. Suddenly I felt a knife of shame, like I was betraying\nScott/Billy somehow. I took a step back.\n\n\"Jerry, I am very sorry that we argued.\"\n\nI sighed out a breath I hadn't known I was holding in. \"Me, too.\"\n\n\"They're starting the bidding. May I sit with you?\"\n\nAnd so the three of us sat together, and Craphound shook Scott/Billy's hand and\nthe auctioneer started into his harangue.\n\nIt was a night for unusual occurrences. I bid on a piece, something I told\nmyself I'd never do. It was a set of four matched Li'l Orphan Annie Ovaltine\nglasses, like Grandma's had been, and seeing them in the auctioneer's hand took\nme right back to her kitchen, and endless afternoons passed with my colouring\nbooks and weird old-lady hard candies and Liberace albums playing in the living\nroom.\n\n\"Ten,\" I said, opening the bidding.\n\n\"I got ten, ten,ten, I got ten, who'll say twenty, who'll say twenty, twenty for\nthe four.\"\n\nCraphound waved his bidding card, and I jumped as if I'd been stung.\n\n\"I got twenty from the space cowboy, I got twenty, sir will you say thirty?\"\n\nI waved my card.\n\n\"That's thirty to you sir.\"\n\n\"Forty,\" Craphound said.\n\n\"Fifty,\" I said even before the auctioneer could point back to me. An old pro,\nhe settled back and let us do the work.\n\n\"One hundred,\" Craphound said.\n\n\"One fifty,\" I said.\n\nThe room was perfectly silent. I thought about my overextended MasterCard, and\nwondered if Scott/Billy would give me a loan.\n\n\"Two hundred,\" Craphound said.\n\nFine, I thought. Pay two hundred for those. I can get a set on Queen Street for\nthirty bucks.\n\nThe auctioneer turned to me. \"The bidding stands at two. Will you say two-ten,\nsir?\"\n\nI shook my head. The auctioneer paused a long moment, letting me sweat over the\ndecision to bow out.\n\n\"I have two -- do I have any other bids from the floor? Any other bids? Sold,\n$200, to number 57.\" An attendant brought Craphound the glasses. He took them\nand tucked them under his seat.\n\n#\n\nI was fuming when we left. Craphound was at my elbow. I wanted to punch him --\nI'd never punched anyone in my life, but I wanted to punch him.\n\nWe entered the cool night air and I sucked in several lungfuls before lighting a\ncigarette.\n\n\"Jerry,\" Craphound said.\n\nI stopped, but didn't look at him. I watched the taxis pull in and out of the\ngarage next door instead.\n\n\"Jerry, my friend,\" Craphound said.\n\n\"_What_?\" I said, loud enough to startle myself. Scott, beside me, jerked as\nwell.\n\n\"We're going. I wanted to say goodbye, and to give you some things that I won't\nbe taking with me.\"\n\n\"What?\" I said again, Scott just a beat behind me.\n\n\"My people -- we're going. It has been decided. We've gotten what we came for.\"\n\nWithout another word, he set off towards his van. We followed along behind,\nshell-shocked.\n\nCraphound's exoskeleton executed another macro and slid the panel-door aside,\nrevealing the cowboy trunk.\n\n\"I wanted to give you this. I will keep the glasses.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said.\n\n\"You're all leaving?\" Scott asked, with a note of urgency.\n\n\"It has been decided. We'll go over the next twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"But _why_?\" Scott said, sounding almost petulant.\n\n\"It's not something that I can easily explain. As you must know, the things we\ngave you were trinkets to us -- almost worthless. We traded them for something\nthat was almost worthless to you -- a fair trade, you'll agree -- but it's time\nto move on.\"\n\nCraphound handed me the cowboy trunk. Holding it, I smelled the lubricant from\nhis exoskeleton and the smell of the attic it had been mummified in before\nmaking its way into his hands. I felt like I almost understood.\n\n\"This is for me,\" I said slowly, and Craphound nodded encouragingly. \"This is\nfor me, and you're keeping the glasses. And I'll look at this and feel. . .\"\n\n\"You understand,\" Craphound said, looking somehow relieved.\n\nAnd I _did_. I understood that an alien wearing a cowboy hat and sixguns and\ngiving them away was a poem and a story, and a thirtyish bachelor trying to\nspend half a month's rent on four glasses so that he could remember his\nGrandma's kitchen was a story and a poem, and that the disused fairground\noutside Calgary was a story and a poem, too.\n\n\"You're craphounds!\" I said. \"All of you!\"\n\nCraphound smiled so I could see his gums and I put down the cowboy trunk and\nclapped my hands.\n\n#\n\nScott recovered from his shock by spending the night at his office, crunching\nnumbers talking on the phone, and generally getting while the getting was good.\nHe had an edge -- no one else knew that they were going.\n\nHe went pro later that week, opened a chi-chi boutique on Queen Street, and\nhired me on as chief picker and factum factotum.\n\nScott was not Billy the Kid. Just another Bay Street shyster with a cowboy\njones. From the way they come down and spend, there must be a million of them.\n\nOur draw in the window is a beautiful mannequin I found, straight out of the\nFifties, a little boy we call The Beaver.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
