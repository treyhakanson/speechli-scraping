What unimaginable power were they\ndefending against? Why was it abandoned? There was no answer, all was\ndead.\n\nBut--not quite all.\n\nFor in a room above the tomb-like fortress a powerful transmitter\nbeamed its birdlike, fluting sounds toward earth. Near it, on a huge\nstar-map of the universe, with light-years measured by inches, ten tiny\nred sparks were moving, crawling inexorably toward the center.\n\nMoving, at many times the speed of light, with the acquired mass\nof suns ... moving, on a course that would pass through the solar\nsystem.\n\nThe unknown aliens would not even see our sun explode from the force\nof their passing, would not even notice the tiny speck called Earth as\nit died....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nThe signals from space began a little after midnight, local time, on a\nFriday. They were first picked up in the South Pacific, just westward\nof the International Date Line. A satellite-watching station on an\nisland named Kalua was the first to receive them, though nobody heard\nthe first four or five minutes. But it is certain that the very first\nmessage was picked up and recorded by the monitor instruments.\n\nThe satellite-tracking unit on Kalua was practically a duplicate of\nall its fellows. There was the station itself with a vertical antenna\noutside pointing at the stars. There were various lateral antennae\nheld two feet above ground by concrete posts. In the instrument room\nin the building a light burned over a desk, three or four monitor\nlights glowed dimly to indicate that the self-recording instruments\nwere properly operating, and there was a multiple-channel tape recorder\nbuilt into the wall. Its twin tape reels turned sedately, winding a\nbrown plastic ribbon from one to the other at a moderate pace.\n\nThe staff man on duty had gone to the installation's kitchen for a cup\nof coffee. No sound originated in the room, unless one counted the\nfluttering of a piece of weighted-down paper on the desk. Outside,\npalm trees whispered and rustled their long fronds in the southeast\ntrade wind under a sky full of glittering stars. Beyond, there was\nthe dull booming of surf upon the barrier reef of the island. But the\ninstruments made no sound. Only the tape reels moved.\n\nThe signals began abruptly. They came out of a speaker and were\ninstantly recorded. They were elfin and flutelike and musical. They\nwere crisp and distinct. They did not form a melody, but nearly all the\ncomponents of melody were there. Pure musical notes, each with its own\npitch, all of different lengths, like quarter-notes and eighth-notes\nin music. The sounds needed only rhythm and arrangement to form a\nplaintive tune.\n\nNothing happened. The sounds continued for something over a minute.\nThey stopped long enough to seem to have ended. Then they began again.\n\nWhen the staff man came back into the room with a coffee cup in his\nhand, he heard the flutings instantly. His jaw dropped. He said, \"What\nthe hell?\" and went to look at the instruments. He spilled some of his\ncoffee when he saw their readings.\n\nThe tracking dials said that the signals came from a stationary source\nalmost directly overhead. If they were from a stationary source,\nno plane was transmitting them. Nor could they be coming from an\nartificial satellite. A plane would move at a moderate pace across the\nsky. A satellite would move faster. Much faster. This source, according\nto the instruments, did not move at all.\n\nThe staff man listened with a blank expression on his face. There was\nbut one rational explanation, which he did not credit for an instant.\nThe reasonable answer would have been that somebody, somewhere, had put\na satellite out into an orbit requiring twenty-four hours for a circuit\nof the earth, instead of the ninety to one-hundred-twenty-four-minute\norbits of the satellites known to sweep around the world from west\nto east and pole to pole. But the piping, musical sounds were not\nthe sort of thing that modern physicists would have contrived to\ncarry information about cosmic-particle frequency, space temperature,\nmicrometeorites, and the like.\n\nThe signals stopped again, and again resumed. The staff man was\ngalvanized into activity. He rushed to waken other members of the\noutpost. When he got back, the signals continued for a minute and\nstopped altogether. But they were recorded on tape, with the instrument\nreadings that had been made during their duration. The staff man played\nthe tape back for his companions.\n\nThey felt as he did. These were signals from space where man had never\nbeen. They had listened to the first message ever to reach mankind from\nthe illimitable emptiness between the stars and planets. Man was not\nalone. Man was no longer isolated. Man....\n\nThe staff of the tracking station was very much upset. Most of the\nmen were white-faced by the time the taped message had been re-played\nthrough to its end. They were frightened.\n\nConsidering everything, they had every reason to be.\n\nThe second pick-up was in Darjeeling, in northern India. The Indian\ngovernment was then passing through one of its periods of enthusiastic\ninterest in science. It had set up a satellite-observation post in a\nformer British cavalry stable on the outskirts of the town. The acting\nhead of the observing staff happened to hear the second broadcast to\nreach Earth. It arrived some seventy-nine minutes after the first\nreception, and it was picked up by two stations, Kalua and Darjeeling.\n\nThe Darjeeling observer was incredulous at what he heard--five\nrepetitions of the same sequence of flutelike notes. After each\npause--when it seemed that the signals had stopped before they actually\ndid so--the reception was exactly the same as the one before. It\nwas inconceivable that such a succession of sounds, lasting a full\nminute, could be exactly repeated by any natural chain of events. Five\nrepetitions were out of the question. The notes were signals. They were\na communication which was repeated to be sure it was received.\n\nThe third broadcast was heard in Lebanon in addition to Kalua and\nDarjeeling. Reception in all three places was simultaneous. A signal\nfrom a nearby satellite could not possibly have been picked up so far\naround the Earth's curvature. The widening of the area of reception,\ntoo, proved that there was no new satellite aloft with an orbit period\nof exactly twenty-four hours, so that it hung motionless in the sky\nrelative to Earth. Tracking observations, in fact, showed the source of\nthe signals to move westward, as time passed, with the apparent motion\nof a star. No satellite of Earth could possibly exist with such an\norbit unless it was close enough to show a detectable parallax. This\ndid not.\n\nA French station picked up the next batch of plaintive sounds. Kalua,\nDarjeeling, and Lebanon still received. By the time the next signal was\ndue, Croydon, in England, had its giant radar-telescope trained on the\npart of the sky from which all the tracking stations agreed the signals\ncame.\n\nCroydon painstakingly made observations during four seventy-nine-minute\nintervals and four five-minute receptions of the fluting noises. It\nreported that there was a source of artificial signals at an extremely\ngreat distance, position right ascension so-and-so, declination\nsuch-and-such. The signals began every seventy-nine minutes. They could\nbe heard by any receiving instrument capable of handling the microwave\nfrequency involved. The broadcast was extremely broad-band. It covered\nmore than two octaves and sharp tuning was not necessary. A man-made\nsignal would have been confined to as narrow a wave-band as possible,\nto save power for one reason, so it could not be imagined that the\nsignal was anything but artificial. Yet no Earth science could have\nsent a transmitter out so far.\n\nWhen sunrise arrived at the tracking station on Kalua, it ceased to\nreceive from space. On the other hand, tracking stations in the United\nStates, the Antilles, and South America began to pick up the cryptic\nsounds.\n\nThe first released news of the happening was broadcast in the United\nStates. In the South Pacific and India and the Near East and Europe,\nthe whole matter seemed too improbable for the notification of the\npublic. News pressure in the United States, though, is very great. Here\nthe news rated broadcast, and got it.\n\nThat was why Joe Burke did not happen to complete the business for\nwhich he'd taken Sandy Lund to a suitable, romantic spot. She was his\nsecretary and the only permanent employee in the highly individual\nbusiness he'd begun and operated. He'd known her all his life, and\nit seemed to him that for most of it he'd wanted to marry her. But\nsomething had happened to him when he was quite a small boy--and still\nhappened at intervals--which interposed a mental block. He'd always\nwanted to be romantic with her, but there was a matter of two moons\nin a strange-starred sky, and trees with foliage like none on Earth,\nand an overwhelming emotion. There was no rational explanation for it.\nThere could be none. Often he'd told himself that Sandy was real and\nutterly desirable, and this lunatic repetitive experience was at worst\ninsanity and at the least delusion. But he'd never been able to do\nmore than stammer when talk between them went away from matter-of-fact\nthings.\n\nTonight, though, he'd parked his car where a river sparkled in the\nmoonlight. There was a scent of pine and arbutus in the air and a faint\nthread of romantic music came from his car's radio. He'd brought Sandy\nhere to propose to her. He was doggedly resolved to break the chains a\npsychological oddity had tied him up in.\n\nHe cleared his throat. He'd taken Sandy out to dinner, ostensibly to\ncelebrate the completion of a development job for Interiors, Inc. Burke\nhad started Burke Development, Inc., some four years out of college\nwhen he found he didn't like working for other people and could work\nfor himself. Its function was to develop designs and processes for\ncompanies too small to have research-and-development divisions of their\nown. The latest, now-finished, job was a wall-garden which those\nexpensive interior decorators, Interiors, Inc., believed might appeal\nto the very rich. Burke had made it. It was a hydroponic job. A rich\nman's house could have one or more walls which looked like a grassy\nsward stood on edge, with occasional small flowers or even fruits\ngrowing from its close-clipped surface.[A]\n\n     [Footnote A: Transcriber's Note: The following sentence has been\n     deleted at this point: \"Interiors, Inc., would push the idea of a\n     a bomb shelter or in an atomic submarine where it would cation.\"\n     This is a possible printer error.  A later edition of this work\n     also has this sentence deleted.\n\nIt was done. A production-job room-wall had been shipped and the check\nfor it banked. Burke had toyed with the idea that growing vegetation\nlike that might be useful in a bomb shelter or in an atomic submarine\nwhere it would keep the air fresh indefinitely. But such ideas were for\nthe future. They had nothing to do with now. Now Burke was going to\ntriumph over an obsessive dream.\n\n\"I've got something to say, Sandy,\" said Burke painfully.\n\nShe did not turn her head. There was moonlight, rippling water, and the\ntranquil noises of the night in springtime. A perfect setting for what\nBurke had in mind, and what Sandy knew about in advance. She waited,\nher eyes turned away from him so he wouldn't see that they were shining\na little.\n\n\"I'm something of an idiot,\" said Burke, clumsily. \"It's only fair to\ntell you about it. I'm subject to a psychological gimmick that a girl\nI--Hm.\" He coughed. \"I think I ought to tell you about it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Sandy, still not looking in his direction.\n\n\"Because I want to be fair,\" said Burke. \"I'm a sort of crackpot.\nYou've noticed it, of course.\"\n\nSandy considered.\n\n\"No-o-o-o,\" she said measuredly. \"I think you're pretty normal,\nexcept--No. I think you're all right.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" he told her, \"I'm not. Ever since I was a kid I've\nbeen bothered by a delusion, if that's what it is. It doesn't make\nsense. It couldn't. But it made me take up engineering, I think,\nand ...\"\n\nHis voice trailed away.\n\n\"And what?\"\n\n\"Made an idiot out of me,\" said Burke. \"I was always pretty crazy about\nyou, and it seems to me that I took you to a lot of dances and such in\nhigh school, but I couldn't act romantic. I wanted to, but I couldn't.\nThere was this crazy delusion....\"\n\n\"I wondered, a little,\" said Sandy, smiling.\n\n\"I _wanted_ to be romantic about you,\" he told her urgently. \"But this\ndamned obsession kept me from it.\"\n\n\"Are you offering to be a brother to me now?\" asked Sandy.\n\n\"No!\" said Burke explosively. \"I'm fed up with myself. I want to be\ndifferent. Very different. With you!\"\n\nSandy smiled again.\n\n\"Strangely enough, you interest me,\" she told him. \"Do go on!\"\n\nBut he was abruptly tongue-tied. He looked at her, struggling to speak.\nShe waited.\n\n\"I w-want to ask you to m-m-marry me,\" said Burke desperately. \"But I\nhave to tell you about the other thing first. Maybe you won't want....\"\n\nHer eyes were definitely shining now. There was soft music and rippling\nwater and soft wind in the trees. It was definitely the time and place\nfor romance.\n\nBut the music on the car radio cut off abruptly. A harsh voice\ninterrupted:\n\n\"_Special Bulletin! Special Bulletin! Messages of unknown origin are\nreaching Earth from outer space! Special Bulletin! Messages from outer\nspace!_\"\n\nBurke reached over and turned up the sound. Perhaps he was the only man\nin the world who would have spoiled such a moment to listen to a news\nbroadcast, and even he wouldn't have done it for a broadcast on any\nother subject. He turned the sound high.\n\n\"_This is a special broadcast from the Academy of Sciences in\nWashington, D. C._\" boomed the speaker. \"_Some thirteen hours ago a\nsatellite-tracking station in the South Pacific reported picking up\nsignals of unknown origin and great strength, using the microwave\nfrequencies also used by artificial satellites now in orbit around\nEarth. The report was verified shortly afterward from India, then Near\nEast tracking stations made the same report. European listening posts\nand radar telescopes were on the alert when the sky area from which\nthe signals come rose above the horizon. American stations have again\nverified the report within the last few minutes. Artificial signals,\nplainly not made by men, are now reaching Earth every seventy-nine\nminutes from remotest space. There is as yet no hint of what the\nmessages may mean, but that they are an attempt at communication is\ncertain. The signals have been recorded on tape, and the sounds which\nfollow are those which have been sent to Earth by alien, non-human,\nintelligent beings no one knows how far away._\"\n\nA pause. Then the car radio, with night sounds and the calls of\nnightbirds for background, gave out crisp, distinct fluting noises,\nlike someone playing an arbitrary selection of musical notes on a\nstrange wind instrument.\n\nThe effect was plaintive, but Burke stiffened in every muscle at the\nfirst of them. The fluting noises were higher and lower in turn. At\nintervals, they paused as if between groups of signals constituting\na word. The enigmatic sounds went on for a full minute. Then they\nstopped. The voice returned:\n\n\"_These are the signals from space. What you have heard is apparently\na complete message. It is repeated five times and then ceases. An hour\nand nineteen minutes later it is again repeated five times...._\"\n\nThe voice continued, while Burke remained frozen and motionless in\nthe parked car. Sandy watched him, at first hopefully, and then\nbewilderedly. The voice said that the signal strength was very great.\nBut the power for artificial-satellite broadcasts is only a fraction of\na watt. These signals, considering the minimum distance from which they\ncould come, had at least thousands of kilowatts behind them.\n\nSomewhere out in space, farther than man's robot rockets had ever gone,\nhuge amounts of electric energy were controlled to send these signals\nto Earth. Scientists were in disagreement about the possible distance\nthe signals had traveled, whether they were meant solely for Earth\nor not, and whether they were an attempt to open communication with\nhumanity. But nobody doubted that the signals were artificial. They had\nbeen sent by technical means. They could not conceivably be natural\nphenomena. Directional fixes said absolutely that they did not come\nfrom Mars or Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune and Uranus and Pluto were not\nnearly in the line of the signals' travel. Of course Venus and Mercury\nwere to sunward of Earth, which ruled them out, since the signals\narrived only on the night side of mankind's world. Nobody could guess,\nas yet, where they did originate.\n\nBurke sat utterly still, every muscle tense. He was so pale that even\nin the moonlight Sandy saw it. She was alarmed.\n\n\"Joe! What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Did you--hear that?\" he asked thinly. \"The signals?\"\n\n\"Of course. But what....\"\n\n\"I recognized them,\" said Burke, in a tone that was somehow despairing.\n\"I've heard signals like that every so often since I was a kid.\" He\nswallowed. \"It was sounds like that, and what went with them, that has\nbeen the--trouble with me. I was going to tell you about it--and ask\nyou if you'd marry me anyway.\"\n\nHe began to tremble a little, which was not at all like the Joe Burke\nthat Sandy knew.\n\n\"I don't quite under--\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I've gone out of my head,\" he said unsteadily. \"Look,\nSandy! I was going to propose to you. Instead, I'm going to take you\nback to the office. I'm going to play you a recording I made a year\nago. I think that when you've heard it you'll decide you wouldn't want\nto marry me anyhow.\"\n\nSandy looked at him with astonished eyes.\n\n\"You mean those signals from somewhere mean something special to you?\"\n\n\"Very special,\" said Burke. \"They raise the question of whether I've\nbeen crazy, and am suddenly sane, or whether I've been sane up to now,\nand have suddenly gone crazy.\"\n\nThe radio switched back to dance music. Burke cut it off. He started\nthe car's motor. He backed, swung around, and headed for the office and\nconstruction shed of Burke Development, Inc.\n\nElsewhere, the profoundest minds of the planet gingerly examined the\nappalling fact that signals came to Earth from a place where men could\nnot be. A message came from something which was not human. It was a\nsuggestion to make cold chills run up and down any educated spine.\nBut Burke drove tensely, and the road's surface sped toward the car's\nwheels and vanished under them. A warm breeze hummed and thuttered\naround the windshield. Sandy sat very still.\n\n\"The way I'm acting doesn't make sense, does it?\" Burke asked. \"Do you\nfeel like you're riding with a lunatic?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"But I never thought that if you ever did get around\nto asking me to marry you, somebody from outer space would forbid the\nbanns! Can't you tell me what all this is about?\"\n\n\"I doubt it very much,\" he told her. \"Can you tell me what the signals\nare about?\"\n\nShe shook her head. He drove through the night. Presently he said,\n\"Aside from my private angle on the matter, there are some queer\nthings about this business. Why should somebody out in space send us\na broadcast? It's not from a planet, they say. If there's a spaceship\non the way here, why warn us? If they want to be friends, they can't\nbe sure we'll permit it. If they intend to be enemies, why throw away\nthe advantage of surprise? In either case, it would be foolish to send\ncryptic messages on ahead. And any message would have to be cryptic.\"\n\nThe car went whirring along the roadway. Soon twinkling lights appeared\namong the trees. The small and larger buildings of Burke Development,\nInc., came gradually into view. They were dark objects in a large empty\nspace on the very edge of Burke's home town.\n\n\"And why,\" he went on, \"why send a complex message if they only wanted\nto say that they were space travelers on the way to Earth?\"\n\nThe exit from the highway to Burke Development appeared. Burke swung\noff the surfaced road and into the four-acre space his small and\nunusual business did not begin to fill up.\n\n\"If it were an offer of communication, it should be short and simple.\nMaybe an arithmetic sequence of dots, to say that they were intelligent\nbeings and would like the sequence carried on if we had brains, too.\nThen we'd know somebody friendly was coming and wanted to exchange\nideas before, if necessary, swapping bombs.\"\n\nThe car's headlights swept over the building in which the experimental\nwork of Burke Development was done and on to the small house in which\nSandy kept the books and records of the firm. Burke put on the brakes\nbefore the office door.\n\n\"Just to see if my head is working right,\" he said, \"I raise a question\nabout those signals. One doesn't send a long message to emptiness,\nrepeated, in the hope that someone may be around to catch it. One\ncalls, and sends a long message only when the call is answered. The\ncall says who's wanted and who's calling, but nothing more. This isn't\nthat sort of thing.\"\n\nHe got out of the car and opened the door on her side, then unlocked\nthe office door and went in. He switched on the lights inside. For a\nmoment, Sandy did not move. Then she slowly got out of the car and\nentered the office which was so completely familiar. Burke bent over\nthe office safe, turning the tumbler-wheel to open it. He said over\nhis shoulder, \"That special bulletin will be repeated on all the news\nbroadcasts. You've got a little radio here. Turn it on, will you?\"\n\nAgain slowly, Sandy crossed the office and turned on the miniature\nradio on her desk. It warmed up and began to make noises. She dimmed it\nuntil it was barely audible. Burke stood up with a reel of brown tape.\nHe put it on the office recorder, usually used for the dictation of\nthe day's lab log.\n\n\"I have a dream sometimes,\" said Burke. \"A recurrent dream. I've had it\nevery so often since I was eleven. I've tried to believe it was simply\na freak, but sometimes I've suspected I was a telepath, getting some\ngarbled message from somewhere unguessable. That has to be wrong. And\nagain I've suspected that--well--that I might not be completely human.\nThat I was planted here on Earth, somehow, not knowing it, to be of use\nto--something not of Earth. And that's crazy. So I've been pretty leery\nof being romantic about anybody. Tonight I'd managed to persuade myself\nall those wild imaginings were absurd. And then the signals came.\" He\npaused and said unsteadily, \"I made this tape a year ago. I was trying\nto convince myself that it was nonsense. Listen. Remember, I made this\na year ago!\"\n\nThe reels began to spin on the recorder's face. Burke's voice came out\nof the speaker, \"_These are the sounds of the dream_,\" it said, and\nstopped.\n\nThere was a moment of silence, while the twin reels spun silently. Then\nsounds came from the recorder. They were musical notes, reproduced\nfrom the tape. Sandy stared blankly. Disconnected, arbitrary flutelike\nsounds came out into the office of Burke Development, Inc. It was quite\ncorrect to call them elfin. They could be described as plaintive. They\nwere not a melody, but a melody could have been made from them by\nrearrangement. They were very remarkably like the sounds from space.\nIt was impossible to doubt that they were the same code, the same\nlanguage, the same vocabulary of tones and durations.\n\nBurke listened with a peculiarly tense expression on his face. When the\nrecording ended, he looked at Sandy.\n\nSandy was disturbed. \"They're alike. But Joe, how did it happen?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you later,\" he said grimly. \"The important thing is, am I\ncrazy or not?\"\n\nThe desk radio muttered. It was an hourly news broadcast. Burke turned\nit up and a voice boomed:\n\n\"_... one o'clock news. Messages have been received from space in the\ncentury's most stupendous news event! Full details will follow a word\nfrom our sponsor._\"\n\nThere followed an ardent description of the social advantage, personal\nsatisfaction and business advancement that must instantly follow the\nuse of a particular intestinal regulator. The commercial ended.\n\n\"_From deepest space_,\" boomed the announcer's voice, \"_comes a\nmystery! There is intelligent life in the void. It has communicated\nwith us. Today--_\"\n\nBecause of the necessity to give the later details of a cafe-society\ndivorce case, a torch murder and a graft scandal in a large city's\nmunicipal budget, the signals from space could not be fully treated in\nthe five-minute hourly news program. But fifteen seconds were spared\nfor a sample of the cryptic sounds from emptiness. Burke listened to\nthem with a grim expression.\n\n\"I think,\" he said measuredly, \"that I am sane. I have heard those\nnoises before tonight. I know them--I'll take you home, Sandy.\"\n\nHe ushered her out of the office and into his car.\n\n\"It's funny,\" he said as he drove back toward the highway. \"This is\nprobably the beginning of the most important event in human history.\nWe've received a message from an intelligent race that can apparently\ntravel through space. There's no way in the world to guess what it will\nbring about. It could be that we're going to learn sciences to make\nold Earth a paradise. Or it could mean that we'll be wiped out and a\nsuperior race will take over. Funny, isn't it?\"\n\nSandy said unsteadily, \"No. Not funny.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Burke, \"when something really significant happens,\nwhich probably will determine Earth's whole future, all I worry about\nis myself--that I'm crazy, or a telepath, or something. But that's\nconvincingly human!\"\n\n\"What do you think I worry about?\" asked Sandy.\n\n\"Oh ...\" Burke hesitated, then said uncomfortably, \"I was going to\npropose to you, and I didn't.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Sandy. \"You didn't.\"\n\nBurke drove for long minutes, frowning.\n\n\"And I won't,\" he said flatly, after a time, \"until I know it's all\nright to do so. I've no explanation for what's kept me from proposing\nto you up to now, but apparently it's not nonsense. I _did_ anticipate\nthe sounds that came in tonight from space and--I've always known those\nsounds didn't belong on Earth.\"\n\nThen, driving doggedly through a warm and moonlit night, he told\nher exactly why the fluting sounds were familiar to him; how they'd\naffected his life up to now. He'd mentally rehearsed the story,\nanyhow, and it was reasonably well arranged. But told as fact, it was\npreposterous.\n\nShe listened in complete silence. He finished the tale with his car\nparked before the boardinghouse in which Sandy lived with her sister\nPam, they being all that was left of a family. If she hadn't known\nBurke all her life, of course, Sandy would have dismissed him and\nhis story together. But she did know him. It did explain why he felt\ntongue-tied when he wished to be romantic, and even why he recorded a\nweird sequence of notes on a tape recorder. His actions were reasonable\nreactions to an unreasonable, repeated experience. His doubts and\nhesitations showed a sound mind trying to deal with the inexplicable.\nAnd now that the signals from space had come, it was understandable\nthat he should react as if they were a personal matter for his\nattention.\n\nShe had a disheartening mental picture of a place where strange trees\nwaved long and ribbonlike leaves under an improbable sky. Still ...\n\n\"Y--yes,\" she said slowly when he'd finished his uneasy account. \"I\ndon't understand, but I can see how you feel. I--I guess I'd feel the\nsame way if I were a man and what you've experienced happened to me.\"\nShe hesitated. \"Maybe there will be an explanation now, since those\nsignals have come. They do match the ones you recorded from your dream.\nThey're the ones you know about.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" said Burke miserably, \"and I can't dismiss it. I\ncan't do anything until I find out why I know that somewhere there's a\nplace with two moons and queer trees....\"\n\nHe did not mention the part of his experience Sandy was most interested\nin--the person for whom he felt such anguished fear and such\noverwhelming joy when she was found. She didn't mention it either.\n\n\"You go on home, Joe,\" she said quietly. \"Get a good night's sleep.\nTomorrow we'll hear more about it and maybe it will all clear up.\nAnyhow--whatever turns out, I--I'm glad you did intend to ask me to\nmarry you. I intended to say yes.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nBurke was no less disturbed, but his disturbance was of a different\nkind. After he left Sandy at the house where she and her sister\nboarded, he headed back to the plant. He wanted to think things out.\n\nThe messages from space, of course, must presage events of overwhelming\nimportance. The coming of intelligent aliens to Earth might be\ncomparable to the coming of white men to the American continents.\nThey might bring superior techniques, irresistible weapons, and an\nassumption of superiority that would bring inevitable conflict with the\naborigines of Earth. Judging by the actions of the white race on Earth,\nif the newcomers were merely explorers it could mean the coming doom of\nhumanity's independence. If they were invaders....\n\nSomething like this would be pointed out soon after the news itself.\nSome people would react with total despair, expecting the strangers to\nact like men. Some might hope that a superior race would have developed\na kindliness and altruism that on Earth are rather rare. But there was\nno one at all who would not be apprehensive. Some would panic.\n\nBurke's reaction was strictly personal. Nobody else in the world would\nhave felt the same appalled, stunned emotion he felt when he heard the\nsounds from space. Because to him they were familiar sounds.\n\nHe paced up and down in the big, partitionless building in which the\nactual work of Burke Development, Inc., was done. He'd done some\nreasonably good work in this place. The prototype of the hydroponic\nwall for Interiors, Inc., still stood against one wall. It was crude,\nbut he'd made it work and then built a production model which had now\nbeen shipped off complete. A little to one side was a prototype of a\nspecial machine which stamped out small parts for American Tool. That\nhad been a tricky assignment! There were plastic and glass-wool and\nsuch oddments with which he'd done a process-design job for Holmes\nYachts, and a box of small parts left over from the designing job that\ngave one aviation company the only practical small-plane retractable\nlanding-gear.\n\nThese things had a queer meaning for him now. He'd devised the wanted\nproducts. He'd developed certain needed processes. But now he began to\nbe deeply suspicious of his own successes. Each was a new reason for\nuneasiness.\n\nHe grimly questioned whether his highly peculiar obsession had not been\nplanted in him against the time when fluting noises would come from\nthat illimitable void beyond Earth's atmosphere.\n\nHe examined, for the thousandth time, his special linkage with the\nspace noises. In previous soul-searchings he'd pinpointed the time when\nthe whole business began. He'd been eleven years old. He could even\nwork out something close to an exact date. He was living with his aunt\nand uncle, his own parents being dead. His uncle had made a business\ntrip to Europe, alone, and had brought back souvenirs which were\nfascinating to eleven-year-old Joe Burke. There was a flint knife, and\na carved ivory object which his uncle assured him was mammoth ivory. It\nhad a deer's head incised into it. There were some fragments of pottery\nand a dull-surfaced black cube. They appealed to the small boy because\nhis uncle said they'd belonged to men who lived when mammoths roamed\nthe Earth and cave men hunted the now-extinct huge beasts. Cro-Magnons,\nhis uncle said, had owned the objects. He'd bought them from a French\npeasant who'd found a cave with pictures on its walls that dated back\ntwenty thousand years. The French government had taken over the cave,\nbut before reporting it the peasant had thriftily hidden away some\nsmall treasures to sell for himself. Burke's uncle bought them and, in\ntime, presented them to the local museum. All but the black cube, which\nBurke had dropped. It had shattered into a million tissue-thin, shiny\nplates, which his aunt insisted on sweeping out. He'd tried to keep one\nof the plates, but his aunt had found it under his pillow and disposed\nof it.\n\nHe remembered the matter solely because he'd examined his memories so\noften, trying to find something relevant to account for the beginning\nof his recurrent dream. Somewhere shortly after his uncle's visit he\nhad had a dream. Like all dreams, it was not complete. It made no\nsense. But it wasn't a normal dream for an eleven-year-old boy.\n\nHe was in a place where the sun had just set, but there were two moons\nin the sky. One was large and motionless. The other was small and moved\nswiftly across the heavens. From behind him came fluting signals like\nthe messages that would later come from space. In the dream he was\nfull-grown and he saw trees with extraordinary, ribbony leaves like no\ntrees on Earth. They wavered and shivered in a gentle breeze, but he\nignored them as he did the fluting sounds behind him.\n\nHe was searching desperately for someone. A child knows terror for\nhimself, but not for anybody else. But Burke, then aged eleven,\ndreamed that he was in an agony of fear for someone else. To breathe\nwas torment. He held a weapon ready in his hand. He was prepared to\ndo battle with any imaginable creature for the person he needed to\nfind. And suddenly he saw a figure running behind the waving foliage.\nThe relief was almost greater pain than the terror had been. It was a\nkind and amount of emotion that an eleven-year-old boy simply could\nnot know, but Burke experienced it. He gave a great shout, and bounded\nforward toward her--and the dream ended.\n\nHe dreamed it three nights running, then it stopped, for awhile.\n\nThen, a week later, he had the dream again, repeated in every detail.\nHe had it a dozen times before he was twelve, and as many more before\nhe was thirteen. It recurred at random intervals all through his teens,\nwhile he was in college, and after. When he grew up he found out that\nrecurrent dreams are by no means unusual. But this was very far from a\nusual dream.\n\nFrom time to time, he observed new details in the dream. He knew that\nhe was dreaming. His actions and his emotion did not vary, but he was\nable to survey them--like the way one can take note of items in a\nbook one reads while quite absorbed in it. He came to notice the way\nthe trees sent their roots out over the surface of the ground before\ndropping suckers down into it. He noticed a mass of masonry off to the\nleft. He discovered that a hill in the distance was not a natural hill.\nHe was able to remember markings on the large, stationary moon in the\nsky, and to realize that the smaller one was jagged and irregular in\nshape. The dream did not change, but his knowledge of the place of the\ndream increased.\n\nAs he grew older, he was startled to realize that though the trees, for\nexample, were not real, they were consistent with reality. The weapon\nhe held in his hand was especially disturbing. Its grip and barrel\nwere transparent plastic, and in the barrel there was a sequence of\npeculiarly-shaped forms, in and about which wire had been wound. As a\ngrown man he'd made such shapes in metal, once. He'd tried them out as\nmagnets in a job for American Tool. But they weren't magnets. They were\nsomething specific and alarming instead. He also came to know exactly\nwhat the mass of masonry was, and it was a sober engineering feat. No\nboy of eleven could have imagined it.\n\nAnd always there were the flutelike musical sounds coming from\nbehind him. When he was twenty-five he'd memorized them. He'd heard\nthem--dreamed them--hundreds of times. He tried to duplicate them on\na flute and devised a special mute to get exactly the tone quality he\nremembered so well. He made a recording to study, but the study was\nfutile.\n\nIn a way, it was unwholesome to be so much obsessed by a dream. In a\nway, the dream was magnificently irrelevant to messages transmitted\nthrough millions of miles of emptiness. But the flutelike sounds linked\nit--now--to reality! He paced up and down in the empty, resonant\nbuilding and muttered, \"I ought to talk to the space-exploration\npeople.\"\n\nThen he laughed. That was ironical. All the crackpots in the world\nwould be besieging all the authorities who might be concerned with the\nsounds from space, impassionedly informing them what Julius Caesar, or\nChief Sitting Bull, or some other departed shade, had told them about\nthe matter via automatic writing or Ouija boards. Those who did not\nclaim ghostly authority would explain that they had special talents, or\na marvelous invention, or that they were members of the race which had\nsent the messages the satellite-tracking stations received.\n\nNo. It would serve no purpose to inform the Academy of Sciences that\nhe'd been dreaming signals like the ones that now agitated humanity.\nIt was too absurd. But it was unthinkable for a person of Burke's\ntemperament to do nothing. So he set to work in exactly the fashion of\none of the crackpots he disliked.\n\nActually, the job should have been undertaken in ponderous secrecy by\ncommittees from various learned societies, official bureaus, and all\nthe armed forces. There should have been squabbles about how the task\nwas to be divided up, bitter arguments about how much money was to be\nspent by whom, violent disagreements about research-and-development\ncontracts. It should have been treated as a program of research, in\nwhich everybody could claim credit for all achievements and nobody was\nto blame for blunders.\n\nBurke could not command resources for so ambitious an undertaking. And\nhe knew that as a private project it was preposterous. But he began the\nsort of preliminary labor that an engineer does before he really sets\nto work.\n\nHe jotted down some items that he didn't have to worry about. The\nwall-garden he'd made for Interiors, Inc., would fit neatly into\nwhatever final result he got--if he got a final result. He had a\nmanufacturing process available for glass-wool and plastics. If he\ncould get hold of an inertia-controlled computer he'd be all set,\nbut he doubted that he could. The crucial item was a memo he'd made\nfrom a memory of the dream weapon. It concerned certain oddly-shaped\nbits of metal, with fine wires wound eccentrically about them, which\nflew explosively to pieces when a current went through them. That was\nsomething to worry about right away.\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning, then, Burke routed out the laboratory\nnotes on the small-sized metal-stamping machine he had designed for\nAmerican Tool. He'd tried to do the job with magnets, but they flew\napart. He'd wound up with blank cartridges to provide the sudden,\nexplosive stamping action required, but the notes on the quasi-magnets\nwere complete.\n\nHe went through them carefully. An electromagnet does not really attain\nits full power immediately after the current is turned on. There is an\ninductive resistance, inherent in a wound magnet, which means that the\nmagnetism builds up gradually. From his memory of the elements in a\ntransparent-plastic hand-weapon barrel, Burke had concluded that it was\npossible to make a magnet without inductive resistance. He tried it.\nWhen the current went on it went to full strength immediately. In fact,\nit seemed to have a negative-induction effect. But the trouble was that\nit wasn't a magnet. It was something else. It wound up as scrap.\n\nNow, very reflectively, he plugged in a metal lathe and carefully\nturned out a very tiny specimen of the peculiarly-shaped magnetic\ncore. He wound it by hand, very painstakingly. It was a tricky job.\nIt was six o'clock Saturday morning when the specimen was finished.\nHe connected the leads to a storage battery and threw the switch. The\nsmall object tore itself to bits, and the core landed fifteen feet from\nwhere it had been. Burke beamed.\n\nHe wasn't tired, but he wanted to think things over so he drove to a\nnearby diner and got coffee and a roll and reflected with satisfaction\nupon his accomplishment. At the cost of several hours' work he'd made\na thing like a magnet, which wasn't a magnet, and which destroyed\nitself when turned on. As he drank his coffee, a radio news period came\non. He listened.\n\nThe signals still arrived from space, punctually, seventy-nine minutes\napart. At this moment, 6:30 A.M., they were not heard on the\nAtlantic coast, but the Pacific coast still picked them up and they\nwere heard in Hawaii and again on the South Pacific island of Kalua.\n\nBurke drove back to the plant. He was methodical, now. He reactivated\nthe prototype wall-garden which he'd neglected while building the\nlarger one for Interiors, Inc. The experimental one had been made in\nfour sections so he could try different pumping systems and nutrient\nsolutions. Now he set the pumps to work. The plants looked ragged, but\nthey'd perk up with proper lighting and circulation of the hydroponic\nliquid.\n\nThen he went into the plant's small office building and sat down with\ndrawing instruments to modify the design of the magnetic core. At\neleven he'd worked out a rough theory and refined the design, with\ncurves and angles all complete. At four the next morning a second,\nmodified magnet-core was formed and polished.\n\nHe'd heard the first newscast on Friday night. It was now early Sunday\nmorning, and although he was tired, he was still not sleepy. He worked\non doggedly, winding fine magnet wire on a noticeably complicated metal\nform. Just before sunrise he tested it.\n\nWhen the current went on the wire windings seemed to swell. He'd held\nit in a small clamp while he tested it. The clamp overturned and broke\nthe contact with the battery before the winding wire stretched to\nbreaking-point. But it had not torn itself or anything else to bits.\n\nHe was suddenly enormously weary and bleary-eyed. To anyone else in the\nworld, the consequence of this second attempt to make what he thought\nof as a negative-induction magnet would seem an absolute failure.\nBut Burke now knew why the first had failed and what was wrong with\nthe second. The third would work, just as the unfired hand-weapon\nof his dream would have worked. Now he could justify to himself the\nassociation of a recurrent dream with a message from outer space. The\ndream now had two points of contact with reality. One was the sounds\nfrom emptiness, which matched those in the dream. The other was the\nhand-weapon of the dream, whose essential working part now plainly did\nsomething unknown in a normal world.\n\nBut it would be impossible to pass on his information to anybody\nelse. Too many crackpots have claimed too many triumphs. His actual,\nunpredictable technical achievement would have little chance of\nwinning official acceptance. Especially since he would be considered a\nnon-accredited source. Burke had a small business of his own. He had\nan engineering degree. But he had no background of learned futility to\ngain a hearing for what he now knew.\n\n\"Crackpots of the world, unite!\" he muttered to himself.\n\nHe dragged himself out-of-doors to a cool, invigorating morning and\ndrove somnolently to the diner he'd patronized before. The coffee he\nordered was atrocious, but it waked him. He heard two truck drivers at\nthe counter.\n\n\"It's baloney!\" said one of them scornfully. \"There ain't no people out\nthere! We'd'a heard from them before if there was. Them scientists are\ncrazy!\"\n\n\"Nuts!\" said the other earnestly. \"One of their idle thoughts would\ncrack your brain wide open, mac! They know what's up, and they're\nscared! If you wanna know, I'm scared too!\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Hell! Did you ever drive at night, and have all the stars come in\npairs like snake-eyes--like little mean eyes, lookin' down at you an'\ndespisin' you? You've seen that, ain't you? Whoever's signalin' could\nbe lookin' down at us just like the stars do.\"\n\nThe first man grunted.\n\n\"I don't like it!\" said the second man, fretfully. \"If it was a man\nheadin' out to go huntin' among the stars for somethin' he wanted,\nthat's all right. That's like a man goin' huntin' in the woods with\na gun. But I don't like somebody comin' our way from somewhere else.\nMaybe he's huntin' us!\"\n\nThe two drivers paid for their coffee and went out. And Burke reflected\nwryly that the second man had, after all, expressed a universal\ntruth. We humans do not like to be hunted. The passion with which a\nman-killing wild beast is pursued comes from human vanity. We do not\nlike the idea that any other creature can be better than we are. It is\nhighly probable that if we ever have to face a superior race, we will\ndie of it.\n\nSo Burke went back to the plant and began to make yet another of the\npeculiarly wound magnets-which-were-not-magnets. This was to have\nthree of the odd-shaped cores, formed in line, of a single piece\nof Swedish iron. As the windings were put on they'd be imbedded in\nplastic. Over that would go a casing to keep them from expanding or\nstretching. It ought to be distinctively different from a magnet.\n\nIt was an extremely long and utterly tedious job. He knew what he\nwas doing, but he had doubts about the why. As he worked, though, he\nwrestled out a detailed theory. Discoverers often work like that. It\nwas said that Columbus didn't know where he was going when he started\nout, didn't know where he was when he got there, and didn't know where\nhe'd been when he got back. The history of the discovery of the triode\ntube has points of similarity. Burke had begun with a device which\ndestroyed itself when turned on, developed the idea into a device which\nswelled to uselessness when energized, and now hoped that it would turn\nout at the third try to be something the textbooks said was impossible.\n\nOutside the construction shed, the world went about its business.\nWhile Burke worked on through the Sunday noon hour, a Japanese\nradar telescope aimed at the night sky and made six successive\nposition-findings on the source of the space signals. When sunset found\nhim laboring doggedly at a metal lathe, Croydon made eight. American\nradar telescopes had made others. Carefully computed, the observations\nadded up to the discovery of an independent motion of the signal\nsource. It moved against the stars as if it were a solar-system body\nwith an orbit in the asteroid belt some three hundred sixty million\nmiles from the sun--as compared to Earth's ninety-two million.\n\nAt midnight on Sunday, while Burke painstakingly made micrometric\nexamination of the triple magnet-core, Harvard Observatory reported\nthat there should be a very minor asteroid at the spot in space from\nwhich the signals came.\n\nThe coincidental asteroid was known as Schull's object. It was listed\nas M-387 in the catalogs. It had been discovered in 1913, was a very\nminor celestial body, had an estimated greatest diameter of less than\ntwo miles, and its brightness had been noticed to vary, suggesting\nthat it was of irregular shape. It was too insignificant to have been\nkept under constant observation, but the signals from space appeared\ndefinitely to originate from its position.\n\nAn hour after midnight, Eastern Standard time, Palomar detected the\ninfinitesimal speck of light which was Schull's object at exactly\nthe place the radar telescopes insisted was the signal source.\nSatellite-watching stations now monitored the cryptic signals around\nthe clock, and radar telescopes began to sweep space for possible\nanswers to the space broadcast. There was an uncomfortable possibility\nthat the transmitter might not be signaling Earth, after all, but a\nfellow mystery of space--an associate or a sister-ship.\n\nMore data turned up. M.I.T. made examination of the signals\nthemselves. Timed, the intervals between notes varied as if keyed\nby something alive. But successive broadcasts were identical to\nmicroseconds. The conclusion was that the original broadcast had\nbeen set up by hand, as it were, but that all were now transmitted\nmechanically--automatically--by a robot transmitter.\n\nIt was Monday morning when Burke completed the last turn of the last\nwinding of his three-element pseudo-magnet. There are many things which\nbecome something else when they change in degree. Electromagnetic\nradiation may be long radio waves or radiant heat or yellow light or\nultraviolet or X-rays, or who knows what, according to its frequency.\nIt is different things with different properties at different\nwavelengths. Burke believed that his cores and windings were something\nother than magnets because the \"flux\" they produced was of a different\nintensity. He did not believe it to be magnetism.\n\nAt nine o'clock Monday morning, he was clumsy from pure, weariness\nwhen he began to fit the outer case on the thing he'd worked so long\nto complete. The hand-weapon in his dream undoubtedly flung bullets\nthrough a rifled bore penetrating the very center of the multiple\ncore. The design of the hand-weapon ruled out any possibility of a\nconsiderable recoil. It wasn't built to allow the hand to take a\nrecoil. So there must be no recoil. On that basis, Burke had made\nwhat finally amounted to a thick rod some six inches long and two in\ndiameter. With the casing in place, it was absolutely solid. There was\nno play for the windings to expand into. He blinked at it. Common sense\nsaid he ought to put it aside and test it when his mind was not nearly\nnumb from fatigue.\n\nThen Sandy came into the constructions shed, looking for him. She'd\narrived for work and seen his car outside the shed. Her expression\nindicated several things: a certain uneasiness, and some embarrassment,\nand more than a little indignation. When she saw him unshaven and\nwobbly with weariness, she protested.\n\n\"Joe! You've been working since Heaven knows when!\"\n\n\"Since I left you,\" he admitted. \"I got interested.\"\n\n\"You look dreadful!\"\n\n\"Maybe I'll look worse after I try out this thing I've made. I'm not\nsure.\"\n\n\"When did you eat last?\" she demanded. \"And when did you sleep?\"\n\nHe shrugged tiredly, regarding the thing in his hands. He'd had enough\nexperience contriving new things to know that no theory is right until\nsomething that depends on it has been made and works. He tended to be\npessimistic. But this time he thought he had it.\n\n\"Is this working night and day a part of your reaction to those\nsignals?\" asked Sandy unhappily. \"If it is--\"\n\n\"Let's try it,\" Burke interrupted. \"It's something I worked out from\nthe dream. Now I'll find out whether I'm crazy or not--maybe.\" He drew\na deep breath. He had a sudden, deep and corrosive doubt of things\nwhich didn't make sense, like space signals and magnets which weren't\nmagnets because they were capable of negative self-induction. \"If this\nshows no sign of working, Sandy....\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe didn't answer. He went heavily over to the table where he had\nstorage-battery current available. He plucked a momentary-contact\nswitch out of a drawer and connected it to the wires from the small\nthing he'd made. Then he hooked on the storage battery.\n\n\"Stand back, Sandy,\" he said tiredly. \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nHe flipped the momentary-contact switch. There was a crash and a roar.\nThe six-inch thing leaped. It grazed Burke's head and drew blood.\nIt flashed across the room, a full thirty feet, and then smashed a\nwater-cooler and imbedded itself in the brick wall beyond. A tool\ncabinet tottered and crashed to the floor. The storage battery spouted\nsteam, swelled. Burke grabbed Sandy and plunged outside with her as the\nbuilding filled with vaporized battery acid.\n\nOutside, he put her down and rubbed his nose with his finger.\n\n\"That was a surprise,\" he said with some animation. \"Are you all right?\"\n\n\"You--could have been killed!\" she said in a whisper.\n\n\"I wasn't,\" said Burke. \"If you're not hurt there's no harm done. It\nlooks like the thing worked! Lucky that was only a millisecond contact!\nNegative self-induction.... I'll break some windows and come to the\noffice.\"\n\nHe did break windows, from the outside, so air could flow through\nthe building and clear away the battery-acid steam. Sandy watched him\nanxiously.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"I'll come quietly.\"\n\nHe followed her to the office. He was so physically worn out, he\ntripped on the office step as he went in.\n\n\"Tell me the news on the signals,\" he said. \"Still coming in?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She looked at him again, worried. \"Joe ... Sit down. Here.\nWhat's happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing except that I'm a genius at second hand. I didn't intend it\nthat way, and maybe it can be covered up, but I've turned out to be\nsane. So I think, maybe you'd better get another job. Since I'm sane\nI'll surely go bankrupt and maybe I'll end up in jail. But it's going\nto be interesting.\" His head drooped and he jerked it upright. \"This is\nreaction,\" he said distinctly. \"I'm tired. I wanted badly to find out\nwhether I was crazy or not. I found out I haven't been. I'm not so sure\nI won't be presently.\" He made a stiff gesture and said, \"Take the day\noff, Sandy. I'm going to rest awhile.\"\n\nThen his head fell forward and he was asleep.\n\nBurke slept for a long time. And this time dreamlessly.\n\nThe thing he made had worked for much less than the tenth of a second,\nbut it came out of his dream, ultimately, and it was linked with\nwhatever sent messages from Asteroid M-387. There was still nothing\nintelligible about the whole affair. It contained no single rational\nelement. But if there was no rational explanation, there was what now\nseemed reasonable action that could be taken.\n\nSo he slept, and as usual the world went on its way unheeding. The\nfluting sounds from the sky remained the top news story of the day.\nThere was no doubt of their artificiality, nor that they came from a\nsmall, tumbling, jagged rock which was one of the least of the more\nthan fifteen hundred asteroids of the solar system. It was two hundred\nand seventy million miles from Earth. The latest computations said that\nnot less than twenty thousand kilowatts of power had been put into\nthe transmitter to produce so strong and loud a signal on Earth. No\npower-source of that order had been carried out to make the signals.\nBut they were there.\n\nAstronomers became suddenly important sources of news. They\ncontradicted each other violently. Eminent scientists observed\ntruthfully that Schull's object, as such, could not sustain life. It\ncould not have an atmosphere, and its gravitational field would not\nhold even a moderately active microbe on its surface. Therefore any\nlife and any technology now on it must have come from somewhere else.\nThe most eminent scientists said reluctantly that they could not deny\nthe possibility that a spaceship from some other solar system had been\nwrecked on M-387, and was now sending hopeless pleas for help to the\nlocal planetary bodies.\n\nOthers observed briskly that anything which smashed into an asteroid\nwould vaporize, if it hit hard enough, or bounce away if it did not.\nSo there was no evidence for a spaceship. There was only evidence\nfor a transmitter. There was no explanation for that. It could be\nmentioned, said these skeptics, that there were other sources of\nradiation in space. There was the Jansky radiation from the Milky Way,\nand radiations from clouds of ionized material in emptiness, and radio\nstars were well known. A radio asteroid was something new, but--\n\nIt was working astronomers, so to speak, who took action. They had\nbeen bouncing signals off of Earth's moon, and various artificial\nsatellites, and they'd flicked signals in the direction of Mars and\nVenus and believed that they got them back. The most probable returned\nradar signal from Mars had been received by a radar telescope in West\nVirginia. It had been turned temporarily into a transmitter and some\nfour hundred kilowatts were poured into it to go out in a tight beam.\nThe working astronomers took over that parabolic bowl again. They\nborrowed, begged, wheedled, and were suspected of stealing necessary\nequipment to put nearly eight hundred kilowatts into a microwave\nsignal, this time beamed at Asteroid M-387. If intelligent beings\nreceived the signal, they might reply. If they did, the working\nastronomers would figure out what to do next.\n\nBurke slept in the office of Burke Development, Inc. His features were\nrelaxed and peaceful. Sandy was completely helpless before his tranquil\nexhaustion. But presently she used the telephone and spoke in a whisper\nto her younger sister, Pam. In time, Pam came in a cab bringing\nblankets and a pillow. She and Sandy got Burke to a pallet on the floor\nwith a pillow under his head and a thickness of blanket over him. He\nslept on, unshaven and oblivious.\n\nPam said candidly, \"If you can feel romantic about anything like that,\nSandy, I'll still love you, but I'll join the men in thinking that\nwomen are mysterious!\"\n\nShe departed in the cab and Sandy took up a vigil over Burke's\nslumbering form.\n\n_Pravda_ announced in its evening edition of Monday that Soviet\nscientists would send out a giant space-probe, intended to orbit\naround Venus, to investigate the space-signal source. The probe would\ncarry a man. It would blast off within six weeks, preceded by drone\nfuel-carriers which would be overtaken by the probe and furnish fuel to\nit. _Pravda_ threw in a claim that Russians had been first to refuel an\naeroplane in flight, and asserted that Soviet physical science would\nmake a space-voyage of two hundred seventy million miles mere ducksoup\nfor their astronaut.\n\nEditorially, American newspapers mentioned that the Russians had tried\nsimilar things before, and that at least three coffins now floated\nin orbit around Earth, not to mention the one on the moon. But if\nthey tried it.... The American newspapers waited for a reaction from\nWashington.\n\nIt came. The most eminent of civilian scientists announced proudly\nthat the United States would proceed to the design and testing of\nmulti-stage rockets capable of landing a party on Mars when Earth and\nMars were in proper relative position. This having been accomplished, a\nrocket would then take off from Mars for Asteroid M-387 to investigate\nthe radio transmissions from that peculiar mass of tumbling rock. It\nwas blandly estimated that the Americans might take off for Mars in\neighteen months.\n\nSandy watched over Burke. There was nothing to do in the office. She\ndid not read. Near seven the telephone rang, and she frantically\nmuffled its sound. It was Pam, asking what Sandy meant to do about\ndinner. Sandy explained in an almost inaudible voice. Pam said\nresignedly, \"All right. I'll come out and bring something. Lucky\nit's a warm day. We can sit in your car and eat. If I had to watch\nJoe sleeping like that and needing a shave as he does, I'd lose my\nappetite.\"\n\nShe hung up. When she arrived, Burke was still asleep. Sandy went\noutside. Pam had brought hero sandwiches and coffee. They sat on the\nsteps of the office and ate.\n\n\"I know,\" said Pam between sympathy and scorn, \"I know you like the\npoor goof, Sandy, but there ought to be some limit to your amorous\nservitude! There are office hours! You're supposed to knock off at\nfive. It's seven-thirty now. And what will being decent to that\nunshaven Adonis get you? He'll take you for granted, and go off and\nmarry a nitwit of a blonde who'll hate you because you'd have been so\nmuch better for him. And she'll get you fired and what then?\"\n\n\"Joe won't marry anybody else,\" said Sandy forlornly. \"If he could fall\nfor anybody, it'd be me. He told me so. He started to propose to me\nFriday night.\"\n\n\"So?\" said Pam, with the superior air of a younger sister. \"Did he say\nenough for you to sue him?\"\n\n\"He can't fall in love with anybody,\" said Sandy. \"He wants to marry\nme, but he's emotionally tangled up with a female he's had dreams about\nsince he was eleven.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd heard everything,\" said Pam. \"But that--\"\n\nSandy explained morosely. As she told it, it was not quite the same\npicture Burke had given her. Her account of the trees in Burke's\nrecurrent dream was accurate enough, and the two moons in the sky,\nand the fluting, arbitrary tones from behind him. Pam had heard their\nduplicates, along with all the broadcast listeners in the United\nStates. But as Sandy told it, the running figure beyond the screen of\nfoliage was not at all the shadowy movement Burke described. Sandy had\nher own ideas, and they colored her account.\n\nThere was a stirring inside the small office building. Burke had waked.\nHe turned over and blinked, astonished to find himself with blankets\nover him and a pillow under his head. It was dark inside the office,\ntoo.\n\n\"Joe,\" called Pam in the darkness, \"Sandy and I have been waiting for\nyou to wake up. You took your time about it! We've got some coffee for\nyou.\"\n\nBurke got to his feet and stumbled to the light switch.\n\n\"Fine!\" he said ruefully. \"Somebody got blankets for me, too! Nice\nbusiness, this!\"\n\nThey heard him moving about. He folded the blankets that had been laid\non the floor for him. He moved across the room and turned on Sandy's\ndesk radio. It hummed, preliminary to playing. He came to the door.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he apologized. \"I worked pretty hard pretty long, and\nwhen the thing was finished I passed out. I feel better now. Did you\nactually say you had some coffee?\"\n\nSandy passed up a cardboard container.\n\n\"Pam's compliments,\" she said. \"We've been waiting until you slept off\nyour working binge. We didn't want to leave you. Booger-men sound\nlikelier than they used to.\"\n\nA voice from the radio broke in.\n\n\" _... o'clock news. A signal has been beamed toward the space-broadcast\ntransmitter by the parabolic reflector of the Bradenville radar\ntelescope, acting as a mirror to concentrate the message toward\nAsteroid M-387. So far there has been no reply. We are keeping a\ncircuit open, and if or when an answer is received we will issue a\nspecial bulletin.... The San Francisco Giants announced today that in a\nthree-way trade--_\"\n\nBurke had listened to nothing else while the news broadcast dealt with\nspace signals, but other news did not mean very much to him just now.\nHe sipped at the cardboard cup of coffee.\n\n\"I think,\" said Pam, \"that since you've waked up I'll take my big\nsister home. You'll be all right now.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Burke abstractedly. \"I'll be all right now.\"\n\n\"Really, Joe, you shouldn't work day and night without a break!\" Sandy\nsaid.\n\n\"And you shouldn't have bothered to stand watch over me,\" he answered.\n\"Well, I guess the shed should be clear of battery fumes by now. I'll\ngo over and see.\"\n\nBurke came back in a few minutes.\n\n\"This thing I made is pretty tough,\" he observed. \"It smashed into\na brick wall, but it was the wall that suffered.\" He fingered it\nthoughtfully. \"I had that dream again just now,\" he volunteered. \"While\nI was asleep on the floor. Sandy, you know about such things better\nthan I do. How much money have I in the bank? I'm going to build\nsomething and it'll probably cost a lot.\"\n\nSandy's hands had clenched when he mentioned the dream. So far, it had\ndone more damage than any dream had a right to do. But it looked as\nif it were about to do more. She told him his balance in the bank. He\nnodded.\n\n\"Maybe I can stretch it,\" he observed. \"I'm going to--\"\n\nThe music had stopped inside the office. The voice of an announcer\ninterrupted.\n\n\"_Special Bulletin! Special Bulletin! Our signals to space have been\nanswered! Special Bulletin! Here is a direct report from the Bradenton\nradar telescope which, within the hour, broadcast a message to space!_\"\n\nA tinny, agitated voice came from the radio, punctuated by those tiny\nbeeping sounds that say that a telephone talk is being recorded.\n\n\"_A definite reply to the human signal to Asteroid M-387 has been\nreceived. It is cryptic, like the first message from space, but is\nunmistakably a response to the eight-hundred-kilowatt message beamed\ntoward the source of those world-wide-received strange sounds...._\"\n\nThe tinny voice went on.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nIn retrospect, events moved much faster than reason would suggest.\nThe first signal from space had been received on a Friday. At that\ntime--when the first flutings were picked up by a tape recorder on\nKalua--the world had settled down to await the logical consequences\nof its history. It was not a comfortable settling-down, because the\nconsequences were not likely to be pleasant. Earth was beginning\nto be crowded, and there were whole nations whose populations\nlabored bitterly with no hope of more than subsistence during their\nlifetime, and left a legacy of equal labor and scarcer food for their\ndescendants. There were hydrogen bombs and good intentions, and\npolitics and a yearning for peace, and practically all individual men\nfelt helpless before a seemingly merciless march of ominous events. At\nthat time, too, nearly everybody worked for somebody else, and a large\npart of the employed population justified its existence by the length\nof time spent at its place of employment. Nobody worried about what he\ndid there.\n\nIn the richer nations, everybody wanted all the rewards earned for\nthem by generations gone by, but nobody was concerned about leaving\nhis children better off. An increasingly smaller number of people were\nwilling to take responsibility for keeping things going. There'd been\na time when half of Earth fought valiantly to make the world safe for\ndemocracy. Now, in the richer nations, most men seemed to believe that\nthe world had been made safe for a four-card flush, which was the hand\nthey'd been dealt and which nobody tried to better.\n\nThen the signals came from space. They called for a showdown, and\nvery few people were prepared for it. Eminent men were called on to\ntake command and arrange suitable measures. They immediately acted as\neminent men so often do; they took action to retain their eminence.\nTheir first instinct was caution. When a man is important enough, it\ndoes not matter if he never does anything. It is only required of him\nthat he do nothing wrong. Eminent figures all over the world prepared\nto do nothing wrong. They were not so concerned to do anything right.\n\nBurke, however, was not important enough to mind making a mistake\nor two. And there were other non-famous people to whom the\nextra-terrestrial sounds suggested action instead of precautions.\nMostly they were engineers with no reputations to lose. They'd\nscrabbled together makeshift equipment, ignored official channels, and\nin four days--Friday to Monday--they had eight hundred kilowatts ready\nto fling out toward emptiness, in response to the signal from M-387.\n\nThe transmission they'd sent out was five minutes long. It began with\na re-transmission of part of the message Earth had received. This\nplainly identified the signal from Earth as a response to the cryptic\nflutings. Then there were hummings. One dot, two dots, three, and so\non. These hummings assured whoever or whatever was out yonder that\nthe inhabitants of Earth could count. Then it was demonstrated that\ntwo dots plus two dots were known to equal four dots, and that four\nand four added up to eight. The inhabitants of Earth could add. There\nfollowed the doubtless interesting news that two and two and two and\ntwo was eight. Humanity could multiply.\n\nArithmetic, in fact, filled up three minutes of the\neight-hundred-kilowatt beam-signal. Then a hearty human voice--the\npresident of a great university--said warmly:\n\n\"_Greetings froth Earth! We hope for splendid things from this opening\nof communication with another race whose technical achievements fill us\nwith admiration._\"\n\nMore flutings repeated that the Earth signal was intended for whoever\nor whatever used flutelike sounds for signaling purposes, and the\nmessage came to an end with an arch comment from the university\npresident: \"_We hope you'll answer!_\"\n\nWhen this elaborate hodge-podge had been flung out to immensity, the\nprominent persons who'd devised it shook hands with each other. They\nwere confident that if intelligent beings did exist where the mournful\nmusical notes came from, interplanetary or interstellar communication\ncould be said to have begun. The engineers who'd sweated together the\nequipment simply hoped their signal would reach its target.\n\nIt did. It went out just after the end of a reception of a five-minute\nbroadcast from M-387. Seventy-nine minutes should have passed before\nany other sound from M-387. But an answer came much more quickly than\nthat. In thirty-four minutes, five and three-tenth seconds, a new\nsignal came from beyond the sky. It came in a rush. It came from the\ntransmitter out in orbit far beyond Mars. It came with the same volume.\n\nIt started with an entirely new grouping of the piping tones. There\nwas a specific crispness in their transmission, as if a different\nindividual handled the transmitter-keys. The flutings went on for three\nminutes, then were replaced by entirely new sounds. These were sharp,\ndistinct, crackling noises. A last sequence of the opening flutings,\nand the message ended abruptly. But silence did not follow. Instead, a\nsteady, sonorous, rhythmic series of beeping noises began and kept on\ninterminably. They were remarkably like the directional signals of an\nairway beacon. When the news broadcasts of the United States reported\nthe matter, the beeping sounds were still coming in.\n\nAnd they continued to come in for seventy-nine minutes. Then they broke\noff and the new transmission was repeated. The original message was\nno longer sent. Robot transmitter or no robot transmitter, the first\nmessage had been transmitted at regular intervals for something like\nseventy-six hours and then, instantly on receipt of the beginning of an\nanswer, a new broadcast took its place.\n\nThe reaction had been immediate. The distance between M-387 and Earth\ncould be computed exactly. The time needed for the Earth signal to\narrive was known exactly. And the instant--the very instant--the first\nsound from Earth reached M-387, the second message had begun. There was\nno pause to receive all the Earth greeting, or even part of it. The\nreaction was immediate and automatic.\n\nAutomatic. That was the significant thing. The new message was already\nprepared when the Earth signal arrived. It was set up to be transmitted\non receipt of the earliest possible proof that it would be received.\nThe effect of this rapid response was one of tremendous urgency--or\nabsolute arrogance. The implication was that what Earth had to say was\nunimportant. The Earth signal had not been listened to. Instead, Earth\nwas told something. Something crisp and arbitrary. Maybe there could be\namiable chit-chat later on, but Earth must listen first! The beepings\ncould not be anything but a guide, a directional indicator, to be\nfollowed to M-387. The message, now changed, might amount to an offer\nof friendship, but it also could be a command. If it were a command,\nthe implications were horrifying.\n\nAt the moment of first release, the news had only a limited effect.\nMost of Europe was asleep and much of Asia had not waked up yet. But\nthe United States was up and stirring. The news went to every corner of\nthe nation with the speed of light. Radio stations stopped all other\ntransmissions to announce the frightening event. It is of record that\nfour television stations on the North American continent actually broke\ninto filmed commercials to announce that M-387 had made a response to\nthe signal from Earth. Never before in history had a paid advertisement\nbeen thrust aside for news.\n\nIn the United States, then, there was agitation, apprehension,\nindignation, and panic. Perhaps the only place where anything\nlike calmness remained was inside and outside the office of Burke\nDevelopment, Inc., where Burke felt a singular relief at this evidence\nthat he wasn't as much of a fool as he feared.\n\n\"Well,\" he thought. \"It looks like there _is_ something or somebody out\nthere. If I'd been sure about it earlier--but it probably wasn't time.\"\n\n\"What does this mean?\" asked Sandy. \"This horrible spell of\naround-the-clock working! Are you still trying to do something about\nthe space signals?\"\n\n\"Listen, Sandy,\" said Burke. \"I've been ashamed of that crazy dream of\nmine all my life. I've thought it was proof there was something wrong\nwith me. I'll still have to keep it secret, or nice men in white coats\nwill come and get me. But I'm going to do what all enterprising young\nmen are advised to do--dream greatly and then try to realize my dream.\nIt's quite impossible and it'll bankrupt me, but I think I'm going to\nhave fun.\"\n\nHe grinned at the two sisters as he led them firmly to Sandy's car.\n\n\"Shoo!\" he said pleasantly. \"You'd better go home now. I'll be leaving\nin minutes, heading for Schenectady first. I need some electric stuff.\nThen I'll go elsewhere. There'll be some shipments arriving, Sandy.\nTake care of them for me, will you?\"\n\nHe closed the car door and waved, still grinning. Pam fumed and started\nthe motor. Moments later their car trundled down the highway toward\ntown. Sandy clenched her fists.\n\n\"What can you do with a man like that?\" she demanded. \"Why do I bother\nwith him?\"\n\n\"Shall I answer,\" asked Pam, \"or shall I be discreetly sympathetic? I\nwouldn't want him! But unfortunately, if you do--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Sandy forlornly. \"I know, dammit!\"\n\nBurke was not thinking of either of them then. He opened the office\nsafe, put the six-inch object inside, and took out his checkbook. Then\nhe locked up, got into his car, and headed away from the plant and the\ntown he'd been brought up in. He was unshaven and uncombed and this\nwas an inappropriate time to start out on a drive of some hundreds of\nmiles, but it was a pleasing sensation to know that a job had turned up\nthat nobody else would even know how to start to work on. He drove very\ncheerfully to a cross-country expressway and turned onto it. He settled\ndown at once to drive and to think.\n\nHe drove practically all night. Shortly after sunrise he stopped to\nbuy a razor and brush and comb and to make himself presentable. He\nwas the first customer on hand when a Schenectady firm specializing\nin electronic apparatus for seagoing ships opened up for business. He\nordered certain equipment from a list he'd written on an envelope while\neating breakfast.\n\nThe morning papers, naturally, were full of the story of the answer\nto the Earth signal sent out to M-387. The morning comedians made\njokes about it, and in every one of the business offices Burke visited\nthere was some mention of it. He listened, but had nothing to say. The\noddity of his purchases caused no remark. His was a small firm, but a\nman working in research and development needs strange stuff sometimes.\nHe ordered two radar units to be modified in a particular fashion,\nair-circulation pumps of highly specialized design to be changed in\nthis respect and that. He had trouble finding the electric generators\nhe wanted and had to pay heavily for alterations in them, and even more\nheavily for a promise of delivery in days instead of weeks. He bought a\nself-contained diving suit.\n\nHe was busy for three days, buying things by day, designing by night\nand finding out new things to order. On the second day, United States\ncounter-intelligence reported that the Russians were trying to signal\nM-387 on their own. An American satellite picked up the broadcast. The\nRussians denied it, and continued to try. Burke made arrangements for\nthe delivery of aluminum-alloy bars, rods, girders, and plates; for\nplaster of Paris in ton lots; for closed-circuit television equipment.\nOnce he called Sandy to give her an order to be filled locally. It\nwas lumber, mostly slender strips of lathing, to be on hand when he\nreturned.\n\n\"All kinds of material is turning up,\" said Sandy. \"There've been six\ndeliveries this morning. I'm signing receipts for it because I don't\nknow what else to do. But won't you please give me copies of the orders\nyou've placed so I can check what arrives?\"\n\n\"I'll put 'em in the mail--airmail,\" promised Burke. \"But only six\ndeliveries? There ought to be dozens! Get after these people on long\ndistance, will you?\" And he gave her a list of names.\n\nBurke said suddenly, \"I had that dream again last night. Twice in a\nweek. That's unusual.\"\n\n\"No comment,\" Sandy said.\n\nShe hung up, and Burke was taken aback. But there was hardly any\ncomment she could make. Burke himself had no illusion that he would\never come to a place where there were two moons in the sky and trees\nwith ribbonlike leaves. And if he did--unthinkable as that might be--he\ncould not imagine finding the person for whom he felt such agonized\nanxiety. The dream, recurrent, fantastic, or whatnot, simply could not\nrepresent a reality of the past, present, or future. Such things don't\nhappen. But Burke continued to be moved much more by the emotional urge\nof the repeated experience than by intellectual curiosity about his\nhaving dreamed repeatedly of signals exactly like those from space,\nlong before such signals ever were.\n\nHe made ready to try to do something about those signals. And, all\nreason to the contrary notwithstanding, to him they meant a world with\ntwo moons and strange vegetation and such emotion as nothing on Earth\nhad ever quite stirred up--though he felt pretty deeply about Sandy,\nat that. So he went intently from one supplier of exotic equipment to\nanother, spending what money he had for an impossibility. Impossible\nbecause Asteroid M-387 was not over two miles through at its largest\ndimension, and therefore could not possibly have an atmosphere and\ncertainly not trees, and it could not own even a single moon!\n\nHe spent one day at a small yachting port with a man for whom he'd\nworked out a special process of Fiberglas yacht construction. Through\nthat process, Holmes yachts could be owned by people who weren't\nmillionaires. Holmes was a large, languid, sunburned individual who\nbuilt yachts because he liked them. He had much respect for Burke, even\nafter Burke asked his help and explained what for.\n\nBut that was the day the Russians launched an unmanned space-probe\nheaded toward M-387. That development may have influenced Holmes to do\nas Burke asked.\n\nLater on, it transpired that the probe originally had been designed\nand built as a cargo-carrier to take heavy loads to Earth's moon. The\nRussian space service had planned to present the rest of Earth with a\n_fait accompli_ even more startling than the first Sputnik. They had\nintended to send a fleet of drone cargo-rockets to the moon and then\nassemble them into a colony. Broadcasts would triumphantly explain\nthat the Soviet social system was responsible for another technical\nachievement. But to get a man out to M-387 was now so much more\nimportant a propaganda device that the cargo-carriers were converted\ninto fuel-tankers and the first sent aloft.\n\nAt ten thousand miles up, when the third booster-stage should have\ngiven it a decisive thrust, one of the probe's rocket engines misfired.\nThe space-probe tilted, veered wildly from its course, and went on\naccelerating splendidly toward nowhere. And still the steady, urgent\nbeeping sounds continued to come to Earth, with every seventy-nine\nminutes a broadcast containing one section of crackling sounds and a\ntone of extremest urgency.\n\nThe day after the probe's ineffectual departure, Burke got back to\nhis plant. He brought Holmes with him. Together, they looked over the\naccumulated material for Burke's enterprise and began to sort out the\ntruckloads of plaster of Paris, masses of punched-sheet aluminum,\ngirders, rods, beams of shining metal, cased dynamos, crated pumps,\ntanks, and elaborately padded objects whose purpose was not immediately\nclear. Sandy was overwhelmed by the job of inventorying, indexing, and\notherwise making the material available for use as desired. There\nwere bales of fluffy white cloth and drums and drums of liquids which\ninsisted on leaking, and smelled very badly when they did. But Burke\nfound some items not yet on hand, and fretted, so Sandy brought her\nsister Pam into the office to add to the office force.\n\nSandy and Pam worked quite as hard in the office as Burke and Holmes\nin the construction shed. They telephoned protests at delays, verified\nshipments, scolded shipping-clerks, argued with transportation-system\nexpediters, wrote letters, answered letters, compared invoices with\norders, sternly battled with negligence and delays of all kinds, and\nin between kept the books of Burke Development, Inc., up to date so\nthat at any instant Burke could find out how much money he'd spent and\nhow little remained. The two girls in the office were necessary to\nthe operations which at first centered in the construction shed, but\nshortly began to show up outside.\n\nFour workmen arrived from the Holmes' Yacht shipyard. They looked at\nblueprints and drawings made by Holmes and Burke together, regarded\nwith pained expressions the material they were to use, and set to\nwork. This was on the day the second Russian space-probe lifted from\nsomewhere in the Caucasus Mountains at 1:10 A.M., local time.\n\nThe second probe did not veer off its proper line. Its four boosters\nfired at appropriate intervals and it went streaking off toward\nemptiness almost straight away from the sun. It left behind it a thin\nwhining transmission which was not at all like the beepings of the\nasteroid transmitter.\n\nIn two days a framework of struts and laths took form outside the\nconstruction shed. It looked more like a mock-up of a radio telescope\nthan anything else, but it was smaller and had a different shape. It\nwas an improbable-looking bowl. Under Holmes' supervision, dozens of\nsacks of plaster of Paris found their way into it, coating it roughly\non the outside and very smoothly within. It was then lined tenderly\nwith carefully cut sections of fluffy cloth, with bars and beams and\ngirders placed between the layers. Then reeking drums of liquid were\nmoved to the working-site and their contents saturated the glass-wool.\n\nThe smell was awful, so the workmen knocked off for a day until it\ndiminished. But Sandy and Pam continued to expostulate with shippers\nby long-distance, type letters threatening lawsuits if orders were\nnot filled immediately, and once found that items Burke indignantly\ndemanded had come in and Holmes had carted them off and used them\nwithout notifying anybody. That was the day Pam threatened to resign.\n\n\"It looks like a pudding,\" grumbled Pam, after Sandy had mollified her\nand Burke had apologized for having made her fight needlessly with two\ntransport-lines, a shipping department, and a vice-president in charge\nof sales. \"And they act like it was a baby!\"\n\n\"It'll be a ship,\" said Sandy. \"You know what kind.\"\n\n\"I'll believe it when I see it,\" said Pam. Then she demanded\nindignantly, \"Has Joe looked at you twice since this nonsense started?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Sandy. \"He works all the time. At night he has a\nreceiver tuned to the beepings to make sure he knows if the broadcast\nchanges again. The Russians are still trying to make a two-way contact.\nBut the broadcast just keeps on, ignoring everybody.\" Then she said,\n\"Anyhow, Joe's going to feel awful if it doesn't work. I've got to be\naround to pick up the pieces of his vanity and put them together again.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" said Pam. \"Catch me doing that!\"\n\nAt just that moment Holmes came into the office with a finger dripping\nblood. He had been supervising and, at the same time, assisting in\nthe building of an additional section of laths and struts and he was\nannoyed with himself for the small injury which interfered with his\nwork.\n\nPam did the bandaging. She cooed over him distressedly, and had him\ngrinning before the dressing was finished. He went back to work very\nmuch pleased with himself.\n\n\"I,\" said Sandy, \"wouldn't act like you just did!\"\n\n\"Sister, darling,\" said Pam, \"I won't cramp your act. Don't you\ncriticize mine! That large wounded character is as attractive as\nanything I've seen in months.\"\n\n\"But I feel,\" said Sandy, \"as if I hadn't seen Joe in years!\"\n\nTheir viewpoint was strictly feminine and geared to female ideas and\naspirations. But, in fact, they were probably as satisfied as two girls\ncould be. They were on the side lines of interesting happenings which\nwere being prepared by interesting men. They were useful enough to the\nenterprise to belong to it without doing anything outstanding enough to\namount to rivalry with the men. From a girl's standpoint, it wasn't at\nall bad.\n\nBut neither Burke nor Holmes even faintly guessed at the appraisal\nof their work by Sandy and Pam. To Holmes, the task was fascinating\nbecause it was a ship he was building. It was not a beautiful object,\nto be sure. If the lath-and-plaster mould were removed, the thing\ninside it would look rather like an obese small whale. There were\nrecesses in its rotund sides in which distinctly eccentric apparatus\nappeared. Its interior was even more curious. And still it was a ship.\nHolmes found deep satisfaction in fitting its interior parts into\nplace. It was like, but not the same as, equipping a small vessel with\nfathometers, radars, direction-finders, air-conditioners, stoves,\ngalleys, heads and refrigerators without getting it crowded.\n\nTo be sure, no seagoing ship would have sections of hydroponic\nwall-garden installed, nor would an auxiliary schooner normally have\nsix pairs of closed-circuit television cameras placed outside for a\nview in each and every direction. This ship had such apparatus. But\nto Holmes the building of what Burke had designed was an extremely\nattractive task.\n\nBurke had less fun. He'd set up a huge metal lathe in the construction\nshed, and he labored at carving out of a specially built-up\nSwedish-iron shaft a series of twenty-odd magnet-cores like the triple\nunit he considered successful. Each of the peculiar shapes had to be\ncarved out of the shaft, and all had to remain part of the shaft when\ncompleted. Then each had to be wound with magnet-wire, coated with\nplastic as it was wound. Then a bronze tube had to be formed over all,\nwith no play of any sort anywhere. The task required the workmanship of\na jeweller and the patience of Job. And Burke had had enough experience\nwith new constructions to be acutely doubtful that this would be right\nwhen it was done.\n\nThe Russians sent up a third space-probe, aimed at Asteroid M-387. It\nfunctioned perfectly. Three days later, a fourth. Three days later\nstill, a fifth. Their aim with the fifth was not too good.\n\nThe beeping sounds continued to come in from space. The second message\nremained the same but the crackling sounds changed. There was a\nsystematic and consistent variation in what they apparently had to\nsay. M.I.T. discovered the modification. When its report reached the\nnewspapers, Sandy invaded the construction shed to show Burke the news\naccount. Oil-smeared and harassed, he stopped work to read it.\n\n\"Hell!\" he said querulously. \"I should've had somebody watching for\nthis! I figured the second broadcast was telling us something that\nwould change as time went on. They're telemetering something to us. I'd\nguess there's an emergency or an ultimatum in the works, and this is\ntelling how fast it's coming to a crisis. But I'm already working as\nfast as I can!\"\n\n\"Some cases marked 'Instruments' came this morning,\" Sandy told him.\n\"They're the solidest shipping cases I ever saw. And the bills for\nthem!\"\n\n\"Wire Keller,\" said Burke. \"Tell him they're here and to come along.\"\n\n\"Who's Keller?\" asked Sandy. \"And what's his address?\"\n\nBurke blew up unreasonably, and Sandy said \"I quit!\" In seconds, he had\napologized and assured Sandy that she was quite right and that he was\nan idiot. Of course she couldn't know who Keller was. Keller was the\nman who would install the instruments in the ship outside. Burke gave\nher his address. Sandy was not appeased.\n\nBurke ran a grimy hand despairingly through his hair.\n\n\"Sandy,\" he protested, \"bear with me just a little while! In just a\nfew more days this thing will be finished, and I'll know whether I'm\nthe prize imbecile of history or whether I've actually managed to do\nsomething worth while! Bear with me like you would with a half-wit or a\ndelinquent child or something. Please, Sandy--\"\n\nShe turned her back on him and walked out of the shed. But she didn't\nquit. Burke turned back to his work.\n\nThe Russians sent up another probe. It went off course. There were now\nsix unmanned Russian probes in emptiness, of which four were lined up\nreasonably well along the route which a manned probe, if one were sent\nup, should ultimately travel. The advance probes formed an ingenious\napproach to the problem of getting a man farther out in space than any\nman had been before, but it was horribly risky. But apparently the\nRussians could afford to take such risks. The Americans couldn't. They\nhad a settled policy of spending a dollar instead of a man. It was\nhumanitarian, but it had one drawback. There was a tendency to keep on\nspending dollars and not ever let a man take a chance.\n\nThe Russians had four fuel-carrying drones in line out in space. If a\nship could grapple them in turn and refuel, it might make the journey\nto M-387 in eight or ten weeks instead of as many months. But it was\nnot easy to imagine such a success. And as for getting back....\n\nThe beeping sounds continued to be received by Earth.\n\nA short man with thin hair arrived at Burke Development, Inc. His\nname was Keller, and his expression was pleasant enough, but he was\nso sparing of words as to seem almost speechless. Sandy watched as he\nunpacked the instruments in the massive shipping cases. The instruments\nthemselves were meaningless to her. They had dials, and some had gongs,\nand one or two had unintelligible things printed on paper strips. At\nleast one in the last category was a computer. Keller unpacked them\nreverently and made sure that not a speck of dust contaminated any\none. When he carried them out to the hull, still concealed by the\nlath-and-plaster exterior mould, he walked with the solemn care of a\nman bearing treasure.\n\nThat day Sandy saw him talking to Burke. Burke spoke, and Keller smiled\nand nodded. Only once did he open his mouth to say something. Then he\ncould not have said more than four words. He went happily back to his\ninstruments.\n\nThe next day, Burke made what was intended to be a low-power test of\nthe long iron bar he'd machined so painstakingly and wound so carefully\nbefore enclosing it in the bronze outer case. He'd worked on it for\nmore than two weeks.\n\nHe prepared the test very carefully. The six-inch test model had lain\non a workbench and had been energized through a momentary-contact\nswitch. The full-scale specimen was clamped in a great metal lathe,\nwhich in turn was shackled with half-inch steel cable to the\nfoundations of the construction shed. If the pseudo-magnet flew\nanywhere this time it would have to break through a tremendous\nrestraining force. The switch was discarded. A condenser would\ndischarge through the windings via a rectifier. There would be a single\ndamped surge of current of infinitesimal duration.\n\nHolmes passed on the news. He got along very well with Pam these days.\nAt first he'd been completely careless of his appearance. Then Pam took\nmeasures to distract him from total absorption in the construction job,\nand he responded. Nowadays, he tended to work in coveralls and change\ninto more formal attire before approaching the office. Sandy came upon\nhim polishing his shoes, once, and she told Pam. Pam beamed.\n\nNow he came lounging into the office and said amiably, \"The moment of\ntruth has arrived, or will in minutes.\"\n\nSandy looked anxious. Pam said, \"Is that an invitation to look on at\nthe kill?\"\n\n\"Burke's going to turn juice into the thing he's been winding by hand\nand jittering over. He's worried. He can think of seven thousand\nreasons why it shouldn't work. But if it doesn't, he'll be a pretty\nsick man.\" He glanced at Sandy. \"I think he could do with somebody to\nhold his hand at the critical moment.\"\n\n\"We'll go,\" said Sandy.\n\nPam got up from her desk.\n\n\"She won't hold his hand,\" she explained to Holmes, \"but she'll be\nthere in case there are some pieces to be picked up. Of him.\"\n\nThey went across the open space to the construction shed. It was a\nperfectly commonplace morning. The very temporary mass of lumber and\nlaths and plaster, forming a mould for something unseen inside, was the\nonly unusual thing in sight. There were deep truck tracks by the shed.\nOne of the workmen came out of the air-lock door on the bottom of the\nmould and lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"No smoking inside,\" said Holmes. \"We're cementing things in place with\nplastic.\"\n\nSandy did not hear. She was first to enter the shed. Burke was moving\naround the object he'd worked so long to make. It now appeared to be\nsimply a piece of bronze pipe some fifteen feet long and eight inches\nin diameter, with closed ends. It lay in the bed of an oversized metal\nlathe, which was anchored in place by cables. Burke took a painstaking\nreading of the resistance of a pair of red wires, then of white ones,\nand then of black rubber ones, which stuck out of one end of the pipe.\n\n\"The audience is here,\" said Holmes.\n\nBurke nodded. He said almost apologetically, \"I'm putting in a minimum\nof power. Maybe nothing will happen. It's pretty silly.\"\n\nSandy's hands twisted one within the other when he turned his back to\nher. He made connections, took a deep breath, and said in a strained\nvoice, \"Here goes.\"\n\nHe flipped a switch.\n\nThere was a cracking sound. It was horribly loud. There was a crash.\nBricks began to fall. The end of the metal-lathe bounced out of a\ncorner. Steel cables gave off high-pitched musical notes which went\ndown in tone as the stress on them slackened. One end of the lathe was\ngone--snapped off, broken, flung away into a corner. There was a hole\nin the brick wall, over a foot in diameter.\n\nThe fifteen-foot object was gone. But they heard a high-pitched\nshrilling noise, which faded away into the distance.\n\nThat afternoon the Russians announced that their manned space-probe had\ntaken off for Asteroid M-387. Naturally, they delayed the announcement\nuntil they were satisfied that the launching had gone well. When they\nmade their announcement, the probe was fifty thousand miles out, they\nhad received a message from its pilot, and they predicted that the\nprobe would land on M-387 in a matter of seven weeks.\n\nIn a remote small corner of the afternoon newspapers there was an item\nsaying that a meteorite had fallen in a ploughed field some thirty\nmiles from where Burke's contrivance broke loose. It made a crater\ntwenty feet across. It could not be examined because it was covered\nwith frost.\n\nBurke had the devil of a time recovering it. But he needed it badly.\nEspecially since the Russian probe had gone out from Earth. He\nexplained that it was a shipment to his plant, which had fallen out of\nan aeroplane, but the owner of the ploughed field was dubious. Burke\nhad to pay him a thousand dollars to get him to believe.\n\nThat night he had his recurrent dream again. The fluting signals were\nvery clear.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\nThe public abruptly ceased to be interested in news of the signals.\nRather, it suddenly wanted to stop thinking about them. The public was\nscared. Throughout all human history, the most horrifying of all ideas\nhas been the idea of something which was as intelligent as a man, but\nwasn't human. Evil spirits, ghosts, devils, werewolves, ghouls--all\nhave roused maddened terror wherever they were believed in. Because\nthey were intelligent but not men.\n\nNow, suddenly, the world seemed to realize that there was a _Something_\nout on a tiny frozen rock in space. It signaled plaintively to\nEarth. It had to be intelligent to be able to send a signal for two\nhundred seventy million miles. But it was not a man. Therefore it was\na monster. Therefore it was horrible. Therefore it was deadly and\nintolerable and scarey, and humans abruptly demanded not to hear any\nmore about it. Perhaps they thought that if they didn't think about it,\nit would go away.\n\nNewspaper circulations dropped. News-magazine sales practically\nvanished. A flood of hysterical letters demanded that the broadcasting\nnetworks leave such revolting things off the air. And this reaction was\nnot only in America. Violent anti-American feeling arose in Europe,\nwhich psychologists analyzed as resentment caused by the fact that the\nAmericans had answered the first broadcast. If they hadn't answered the\nfirst, there wouldn't have been a second. But also, even more violent\nanti-Russian feeling rose up, because the Russians had started a man\noff to meddle with the monster who piped so pleadingly. This antipathy\nto space caused a minor political upset in the Kremlin itself, where\na man with a name ending in _ov_ was degraded to much lower official\nrank and somebody with a name ending in _sky_ took his place. This\npartly calmed the Russian public but had little effect anywhere else.\nThe world was frightened. It looked for a victim, or victims, for its\nfear. Once upon a time, witches were burned to ease the terrors of\nignorance, and plague-spreaders were executed in times of pestilence\nto assure everybody that now the plague would cease since somebody had\nbeen killed for spreading it.\n\nOrganizations came into being with the official and impassioned purpose\nof seeing that space research ceased immediately. Even more violent\norganizations demanded the punishment of everybody who had ever\nconsidered space travel a desirable thing. Congress cut some hundreds\nof millions from a guided-missile-space-exploration appropriation as\na starter. A poor devil of a crackpot in Santa Monica, California,\nrevealed what he said was a spaceship he'd built in his back yard\nto answer the signals from M-387. He intended to charge a quarter\nadmission to inspect it, using the money to complete the drive\napparatus. The thing was built of plywood and could not conceivably\nlift off the ground, but a mob wrecked his house, burned the puerile\n\"spaceship\" and would have lynched its builder if they'd thought to\nlook in a cellar vegetable closet. Other crackpots who were more\nsensitive to public feelings announced the picking up of messages\naddressed to the distant Something. The messages, said this second\nclass of crackpot, were reports from spies who had been landed on Earth\nfrom flying saucers during the past few decades. They did not explain\nhow they were able to translate them. A rush of flying-saucer sightings\nfollowed inevitably--alleged to be landing-parties from M-387--and in\nPeoria, Illinois, a picnicking party sighted an unidentified flying\nobject shaped like a soup spoon, the handle obviously being its tail.\nExperienced newspapermen anticipated reports of the sighting of\nunidentified flying objects shaped like knives and forks as soon as\nsomebody happened to think of it.\n\nSandy called a conference on the subject of security. She did not look\nwell, nowadays. She worried. Other people thought about the messages\nfrom space, but Sandy had to think of something more concrete. Six\nmonths earlier, the construction going on within a plaster of Paris\nmould would have been laughed at, tolerantly, and some hopeful people\nmight have been respectful about it. But now it was something utterly\nintolerable to public opinion. Newspapers who'd lost circulation by\ntalking sanely about space travel now got it back by denouncing the\npeople who'd answered the first broadcast. And naturally, with the\nwhole idea of outer space agitatedly disapproved, everybody connected\nwith it was suspected of subversion.\n\n\"A reporter called up today,\" said Sandy. \"He said he'd like to do a\nfeature story on Burke Development's new research triumph--the new\nguided missile that flew thirty miles and froze everything around where\nit landed. I said it fell out of an aeroplane and the last completed\nproject was for Interiors, Inc. Then he said that he'd been talking to\none of Mr. Holmes' men and the man said something terrific was under\nway.\"\n\nBurke looked uneasy. Holmes said uncomfortably, \"There's no law against\nwhat we're building, but somebody may introduce a bill in Congress any\nday.\"\n\n\"That would be reasonable under other circumstances. There's a time for\nthings to be discovered. They shouldn't be accomplished too soon. But\nthe time for the ship out there is right now!\" Burke said.\n\nPam raised her eyebrows. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Those signals have to be checked up on,\" explained Burke. \"It's\nnecessary now. But it could have been bad if our particular enterprise\nhad started, say, two years ago. Just think what would have happened\nif atomic fission had been worked out in peacetime ten years before\nWorld War Two! Scientific discoveries were published then as a matter\nof course. Everybody'd have known how to make atom bombs. Hitler would\nhave had them, and so would Mussolini. How many of us would be alive?\"\n\nSandy interrupted, \"The reporter wants to do a feature story on what\nBurke Development is making. I said you were working on a bomb shelter\nfor quantity production. He asked if the rocket you shot off through\nthe construction-shed wall was part of it. I said there'd been no\nrocket fired. He didn't believe me.\"\n\n\"Who would?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"Hmmmmm,\" said Burke. \"Tell him to come look at what we're doing. The\nship can pass for a bomb shelter. The wall-garden units make sense.\nI'm going to dig a big hole in the morning to test the drive-shaft in.\nIt'll look like I intend to bury everything. A bomb shelter should be\nburied.\"\n\n\"You mean you'll let him inside?\" demanded Sandy.\n\n\"Sure!\" said Burke. \"All inventors are expected to be idiots. A lot of\nthem are. He'll think I'm making an impossibly expensive bomb shelter,\nmuch too costly for a private family to buy. It will be typical of the\ninventive mind as reporters think of it. Anyhow, everybody's always\nwilling to believe other people fools. That'll do the trick!\"\n\nPam said blandly, \"Sandy and I live in a boardinghouse, Joe. You don't\nask about such things, but an awfully nice man moved in a couple of\ndays ago--right after that shaft got away and went flying thirty miles\nall by itself. The nice man has been trying to get acquainted.\"\n\nHolmes growled, and looked both startled and angry when he realized it.\n\nPam added cheerfully, \"Most evenings I've been busy, but I think I'll\nlet him take me to the movies. Just so I can make us all out to be\nidiots,\" she added.\n\n\"I'll make the hole big enough to be convincing,\" said Burke. \"Sandy,\nyou make inquiries for a rigger to lift and move the bomb shelter into\nits hole when it's ready. If we seem about to bury it, nobody should\nsuspect us of ambitions they won't like.\"\n\n\"Why the hole, really?\" asked Sandy.\n\n\"To put the shaft in,\" said Burke. \"I've got to get it under control or\nit won't be anything more than a bomb shelter.\"\n\nKeller, the instrument man, had listened with cheerful interest and\nwithout speaking a word. Now he made an indefinite noise and looked\ninquiringly at Burke. Burke said, explanatorily, \"The shaft seems to\nbe either on or off--either a magnet that doesn't quite magnetize, or\nsomething that's hell on wheels. It flew thirty miles without enough\npower supplied to it to make it quiver. That power came from somewhere.\nI think there's a clue in the fact that it froze everything around\nwhere it landed, in spite of traveling fast enough to heat up from\nair-friction alone. I've got some ideas about it.\"\n\nKeller nodded. Then he said urgently, \"Broadcast?\"\n\nBurke frowned, and turned to Sandy. \"That's part of the broadcast from\nspace that changes--is it still changing?\"\n\n\"Still changing,\" said Sandy.\n\n\"I didn't think to ask you to keep a check on that. Thanks for thinking\nof it, Sandy. Maybe someday I can make up to you for what you've been\ngoing through.\"\n\n\"I doubt it very much,\" said Sandy grimly. \"I'll call the reporter\nback.\"\n\nShe waited for them to leave. When they'd gone, she moved purposefully\ntoward the telephone.\n\nPam said, \"Did you hear that growl when I said I'd go to the movies\nwith somebody else? I'm having fun, Sandy!\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" said Sandy.\n\n\"You're too efficient,\" the younger sister said candidly. \"You're\nindispensable. Burke couldn't begin to be able to put this thing\nthrough without you. And that's the trouble. You should be irresistible\ninstead of essential.\"\n\n\"Not with Joe,\" said Sandy bitterly.\n\nShe picked up the telephone to call the newspaper. Pam looked very,\nvery reflective.\n\nThere was a large deep pit close by the plaster mould when the reporter\ncame next afternoon. A local rigger had come a little earlier and\nwas still there, estimating the cost for lifting up the contents of\nthe mould and lowering it precisely in place to be buried as a bomb\nshelter under test should be. It was a fortunate coincidence, because\nthe reporter brought two other men who he said were civilian defense\nofficials. They had come to comment on the quality of the bomb shelter\nunder development. It was not too convincing a statement.\n\nWhen they left, Burke was not happy. They knew too much about the\nmaterials and equipment he'd ordered. One man had let slip the fact\nthat he knew about the very expensive computer Burke had bought. It\ncould have no conceivable use in a bomb shelter. Both men painstakingly\nleft it to Burke to mention the thirty-mile flight of a bronze object\nwhich arrived coated with frost of such utter frigidity that it\nappeared to be liquid-air snow instead of water-ice. Burke did not\nmention it. He was excessively uneasy when the reporter's car took them\naway.\n\nHe went into the office. Pam was in the midst of a fit of the giggles.\n\n\"One of them,\" she explained, \"is the nice man who moved into the\nboardinghouse. He wants to take me to the movies. Did you notice that\nthey came when it ought to be my lunchtime? He asked when I went to\nlunch ...\"\n\nHolmes came in. He scowled.\n\n\"One of my men says that one of those characters has been buying him\ndrinks and asking questions about what we're doing.\"\n\nBurke scowled too.\n\n\"We can let your men go home in three days more.\"\n\n\"I'm going to start loading up,\" Holmes announced abruptly. \"You don't\nknow how to stow stuff. You're not a yachtsman.\"\n\n\"I haven't got the shaft under control yet,\" said Burke.\n\n\"You'll get it,\" grunted Holmes.\n\nHe went out. Pam giggled again.\n\n\"He doesn't want me to go to the movies with the nice man from\nSecurity,\" she told Burke. \"But I think I'd better. I'll let him ply me\nwith popcorn and innocently let slip that Sandy and I know you've been\nwarned that bomb shelters won't find a mass market unless they sell for\nless than the price of an extra bathroom. But if you want to go broke\nwe don't care.\"\n\n\"Give me three days more,\" said Burke harassedly.\n\n\"Well try,\" said Sandy suddenly. \"Pam can fix up a double date with one\nof her friend's friends and we'll both work on them.\"\n\nBurke frowned absorbedly and went out. Sandy looked indignant. He\nhadn't protested.\n\nBurke got Holmes' four workmen out of the ship and had them help him\nroll the bronze shaft to the pit and let it down onto a cradle of\ntimbers. Now if it moved it would have to penetrate solid earth.\n\nThe most trivial of computations showed that when the bronze shaft had\nflown thirty miles, it hadn't done it on the energy of a condenser\nshorted through its coils. The energy had come from somewhere else.\nBurke had an idea where it was.\n\nPresently he verified it. The cores and windings he'd adapted from a\ntransparent hand-weapon seen in an often-repeated dream--those cores\nand windings did not make electromagnets. They made something for\nwhich there was not yet a name. When current flows through a standard\nelectromagnet, the poles of its atoms are more or less aligned. They\ntend to point in a single direction. But in this arrangement of wires\nand iron no magnetism resulted, yet, the random motion of the atoms in\ntheir framework of crystal structure was co\u00f6rdinated. In any object\nabove absolute zero all the atoms and their constituent electrons and\nnuclei move constantly in all directions. In such a core as Burke had\nformed and repeated along the shaft's length, they all tried to move\nin one direction at the same time. Simultaneously, a terrific surge of\ncurrent appeared in the coils. A high-speed poleward velocity developed\nin all the substance of the shaft. It was the heat-energy contained\nin the metal, all turned instantly into kinetic energy. And when its\nheat-energy was transformed to something else, the shaft got cold.\n\nOnce this fact was understood, control was easy. A single variable\ninductance in series with the windings handled everything. In a certain\nsense, the gadget was a magnet with negative--minus--self-inductance.\nWhen a plus inductance in series made the self-inductance zero,\nneither plus nor minus, the immensely powerful device became docile.\nA small current produced a mild thrust, affecting only part of the\nrandom heat-motion of atoms and molecules. A stronger current produced\na greater one. The resemblance to an electromagnet remained. But\nthe total inductance must stay close to zero or utterly violent and\nexplosive forward thrust would develop, and it was calculable only in\nthousands of gravities.\n\nBurke had worked for three weeks to make the thing, but he developed a\ncontrol system for it in something under four hours.\n\nThat same night they got the bronze shaft into the ship. It fitted\nperfectly into the place left for it. Burke knew now exactly what he\nwas doing. He set up his controls. He was able to produce so minute a\nthrust that the lath-and-plaster mould merely creaked and swayed. But\nhe knew that he could make the whole mass surge unstoppably from its\nplace.\n\nHolmes sent his workmen home. Sandy and Pam went to the movies with\ntwo very nice men who pumped them deftly of all sorts of erroneous\ninformation about Burke and Holmes and Keller and what they were about.\nThe nice men did not believe that information, but they did believe\nthat Sandy and Pam believed it. For themselves, the combination of\nan object made by Burke which flew thirty miles plus the presence of\nHolmes, who built plastic yachts, and the arrival of Keller to adjust\ninstruments of which they had a complete list--these things could not\nbe overlooked. But they did feel sorry for two nice and not over-bright\ngirls who might be involved in very serious trouble.\n\nHolmes and Burke installed directional controls, wiring, recording\ninstruments, etc. Stores and water and oxygen, for emergency use only,\nwent into the lath-and-plaster construction. Holmes took a hammer and\nchisel and painstakingly cracked the mould so that the top half could\nbe lifted off, leaving the bottom half exposed to the open air and sky.\n\nThen the broadcast from space cut off. It had been coming continuously\nfor something like five weeks; one sharp, monotonous note every two\nseconds, with a longer, fluting broadcast every seventy-nine minutes.\nNow a third, new message began. It was yet another grouping of the\nmusical tones, with a much longer interval of specific crackling\nsounds.\n\nKeller had adjusted every instrument and zestfully retested them over\nand over. Burke asked him to see if the third space message compared\nin any way with the second. Keller put them through a hook-up of\ninstruments, beaming to himself, and the answer began to appear.\n\nNewspapers burst into new headlines. \"_Ultimatum from Space_\" they\nthundered. \"_Threats from Alien Space Travelers._\" And as they\npresented the situation it seemed believable that the third message\nfrom the void was a threat.\n\nThe first had been a call, requiring an answer. When the answer went\nout from Earth, a second message replaced the call. It contained not\nonly flute tones which might be considered to represent words, but\ncracklings which might be the equivalent of numbers. The continuous\nbeepings between repetitions of the second message were plainly a\ndirectional signal to be followed to the message source.\n\nIn this context, the newspapers furiously asserted that the third\nmessage was a threat. The first had been merely a summons, the second\nhad been a command to repair to the signaling entities, and the third\nwas a stern reiteration of the command, reinforced by threats.\n\nThe human race does not take kindly to threats, especially when\nit feels helpless. In the United States, there was such explosive\nresentment as to require spread-eagle oratory by all public figures.\nThe President declared that every space missile in store had been\nfitted with atomic-fusion warheads and that any alien spacecraft which\nappeared in American skies would be shot down immediately. Congress\nreported out of committee a bill for rocket weapons which was stalled\nfor six days because every senator and representative wanted to make a\nspeech in its favor. It was the largest appropriation bill ever passed\nby Congress, which less than five weeks before had cut two hundred\nmillions out of a guided-missile-space-exploration budget.\n\nAnd in Europe there was frenzy.\n\nFor Burke and Holmes and Sandy and Pam and the smiling, inarticulate\nKeller, the matter was deadly serious. Fury such as the public felt\nconstituted a witch-hunt in itself. Suspicious private persons\noverwhelmed the FBI and the Space Agency with information about\ncharacters they were sure were giving military secrets to the\nspace travelers on M-387. There were reports of aliens skulking\nabout American cities wearing luxuriant whiskers and dark glasses\nto conceal their non-human features. Artists, hermits, and mere\namateur beard-growers found it wise to shave, and spirit mediums,\nfortunetellers and, in the South, herb doctors reaped harvests by the\nsale of ominous predictions and infallible advice on how to escape\nannihilation from space.\n\nAnd Burke Development, Inc., was building something that neither\nCivilian Defense nor the FBI believed was a bomb shelter.\n\nThe three days Burke had needed passed. A fourth. He and Holmes\npractically abandoned sleep to get everything finished inside the\nplaster mould. Keller happily completed his graphs and took them to\nBurke. They showed that the cracklings, which presumably meant numbers,\nhad been expanded. What they said was now told on a new scale. If the\nnumbers had meant months or years, they now meant days and hours. If\nthey had meant millions of miles, they now meant thousands or hundreds.\n\nBurke was struggling with these implications when there was a tapping\nat the air-lock, through which all entry and egress from the ship took\nplace. Holmes opened the inner door. Sandy and Pam crawled through the\nlock which lay on its side instead of upright. Sandy looked at Burke.\n\nPam said amiably, \"We figured the job was about finished and we wanted\nto see it. How do you fasten this door?\"\n\nHolmes showed her. The vessel that had been built inside the mould\ndid not seem as large as the outside structure promised. It looked\nqueer, too, because everything lay on its side. There were two\ncompartments with a ladder between, but the ladder lay on the floor.\nThe wall-gardens looked healthy under the fluorescent lamps which kept\nthe grass and vegetation flourishing. There were instrument dials\neverywhere.\n\nSandy went to Burke's side.\n\n\"We're all but done,\" said Burke tiredly, \"and Keller's just about\nproved what the signals are.\"\n\n\"Can we go with you?\" asked Sandy.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Burke. \"The first message was a distress call. It\nhad to be. Only in a distress call would somebody go into details so\nany listener would know it was important. It called for help and said\nwho needed it, and why, and where.\"\n\nPam turned to Holmes. \"Can that air-lock be opened from outside?\"\n\nIt couldn't. Not when it was fastened, as now.\n\n\"Somebody answered that call from Earth,\" said Burke heavily, \"and the\nsecond message told more about what was wrong. The clickings, we think,\nare numbers that told how long help could be waited for, or something\non that order. And then there was a beacon signal meant to lead whoever\nwas coming to help to that place.\"\n\nKeller smiled pleasantly at Pam. He made an electrical connection and\nzestfully checked the result.\n\n\"Now there's a third message,\" said Burke. \"Time's running out for\nwhoever needs whatever help is called for. The clickings that seem\nto be numbers have changed. The--what you might call the scale of\nreportage--is new. They're telling us just how long they can wait or\njust how bad their situation is. They're saying that time is running\nout and they're saying, 'Hurry!'\"\n\nThere was a thumping sound. Only Sandy and Pam looked unsurprised.\nBurke stared.\n\nSandy said firmly, \"That's the police, Joe. We've been going to the\nmovies with people who want to talk about you. Yesterday one of them\nconfided to us that you were dangerous, and since he told us to get\naway from the office, we did. There might be shooting. He tipped us a\nlittle while ago.\"\n\nBurke swore. There were other thumpings. Louder ones. They were on the\nair-lock door.\n\n\"If you try to put us out,\" said Sandy calmly, \"you'll have to open\nthat door and they'll try to fight their way in--and then where'll you\nbe?\"\n\nKeller turned from the checking of the last instrument He looked at the\nothers with excited eyes. He waited.\n\n\"I don't know what they can arrest you for,\" said Sandy, \"and maybe\nthey don't either, unless it's unauthorized artillery practice. But you\ncan't put us out! And you know darn well that unless you do something\nthey'll chop their way in!\"\n\nBurke said, \"Dammit, they're not going to stop me from finding out if\nthis thing works!\"\n\nHe squirmed in a chair which had its base firmly fastened to a wall and\nbegan to punch buttons.\n\n\"Hold fast!\" he said angrily. \"At least we'll see....\"\n\nThere were loud snapping sounds. There were creakings. The room\nstirred. It turned in a completely unbelievable fashion. Violent\ncrashings sounded outside. Abruptly, a small television screen before\nBurke acquired an image. It was of the outside world reeling wildly.\nHolmes seized a hand-hold and grabbed Pam. He kept her from falling\nas a side wall became the floor, and what had been the floor became a\nside wall, with the ceiling another. It seemed that all the cosmos\nchanged, though only walls and floors changed places.\n\nSuddenly everything seemed normal but new. The surface underfoot was\ncovered with a rubber mat. The hydroponic wall-garden sections were\nnow vertical. Burke sat upright, and something over his head rotated a\nhalf-turn and was still. But it became coated with frost.\n\nMore crashes. More small television screens acquired images. They\nshowed the office of Burke Development, Inc., against a tilted\nlandscape. The landscape leveled. Another showed the construction shed.\nOne showed cloud formations, very bright and distinct. And two others\nshowed a small, armed, formidable body of men instinctively backing\naway from the outside television lens.\n\n\"So far,\" said Burke, \"it works. Now--\"\n\nThere was a sensation as of a rapidly rising elevator. Such a sensation\nusually lasts for part of a second. This kept on. One of the six\ntelevision screens suddenly showed a view of Burke Development from\nstraight overhead. The buildings and men and the four-acre enclosure\ndwindled rapidly. They were very tiny indeed and nearly all of the town\nwas in the camera's field of vision when a vague whiteness, a cloud,\nmoved in between.\n\n\"The devil!\" said Burke. \"Now they'll alert fighter planes and rocket\ninstallations and decide that we're either traitors or aliens in\ndisguise and better be shot down. I think we simply have to go on!\"\n\nKeller made gestures, his eyes bright. Burke looked worried.\n\n\"It shouldn't take more than ten minutes to get a Nike aloft and after\nus. We must have been picked up by radar already.... We'll head north.\nWe have to, anyhow.\"\n\nBut he was wrong about the ten minutes. It was fifteen before a rocket\ncame into view, pouring out enormous masses of drive-fumes. It flung\nitself toward the ship.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nFrom a sufficient height and a sufficient distance, the rocket's\nrepeated attacks must have appeared like the strikings and twistings of\na gigantic snake. It left behind it a writhing trail of fumes which was\nconvincingly serpentine. It climbed and struck, and climbed and struck,\nlike a monstrous python flinging itself furiously at some invisible\nprey. Six, seven, eight times it plunged frenziedly at the minute\negg-shaped ship which scuttled for the heavens. Each time it missed and\nwrithed about to dart again.\n\nThen its fuel gave out and for all intents and purposes it ceased to\nexist. The thick, opaque trail it left behind began to dissipate.\nThe path of vapor scattered. It spread to rags and tatters of\nunsubstantiality through which the rocket plummeted downward in the\nlong fall which is a spent rocket's ending.\n\nBurke cautiously cut down the drive and awkwardly turned the ship on\nits side, heading it toward the north. The state of things inside the\nship was one of intolerable tenseness.\n\n\"I'm a new driver,\" said Burke, \"and that was a tough bit of driving to\ndo.\" He glanced at the exterior-pressure meter. \"There's no air outside\nto register. We must be fifty or sixty miles high and maybe still\nrising. But we're not leaking air.\"\n\nActually the plastic ship was eighty miles up. The sunlit world beneath\nit showed white patches of cloud in patterns a meteorologist would\nhave found interesting. Burke could see the valley of the St. Lawrence\nRiver between the white areas. But the Earth's surface was curiously\nforeshortened. What was beneath seemed utterly flat, and at the edge of\nthe world all appeared distorted and unreal.\n\nHolmes, still pale, asked, \"How'd we get away from that rocket?\"\n\n\"We accelerated,\" said Burke. \"It was a defensive rocket. It was\ndesigned to knock down jet bomb carriers or ballistic missiles which\ntravel at a constant speed. Target-seeking missiles can lock onto\nthe radar echo from a coasting ship, or one going at its highest\nspeed because their computers predict where their target, traveling\nat constant speed, can be intercepted. We were never there. We were\naccelerating. Missile-guidance systems can't measure acceleration and\nallow for it. They shouldn't have to.\"\n\nFour of the six television screens showed dark sky with twinkling\nlights in it. On one there was the dim outline of the sun, reversed to\nblackness because its light was too great to be registered in a normal\nfashion. The other screen showed Earth.\n\nThere was a buzzing, and Keller looked at Burke.\n\n\"Rocket?\" asked Burke. Keller shook his head. \"Radar?\" Keller nodded.\n\n\"The DEW line, most likely,\" said Burke in a worried tone. \"I don't\nknow whether they've got rockets that can reach us. But I know fighter\nplanes can't get this high. Maybe they can throw a spread of air-to-air\nrockets, though.... I don't know their range.\"\n\nSandy said unsteadily, \"They shouldn't do this to us! We're not\ncriminals! At least they should ask us who we are and what we're doing!\"\n\n\"They probably did,\" said Burke, \"and we didn't answer. See if you can\npick up some voices, Keller.\"\n\nKeller twirled dials and set indicators. Voices burst into speech.\n\"_Reporting UFO sighted extreme altitude co\u00f6rdinates--First rocket\nexhausted fuel in multiple attacks and fell, sir._\" Another voice, very\nbrisk, \"_Thirty-second squadron, scramble! Keep top altitude and get\nunder it. If it descends within range, blast it!_\" Another voice said\ncrisply, \"_Co\u00f6rdinates three-seven Jacob, one-nine Alfred...._\"\n\nKeller turned the voices down to mutters because they were useless.\n\nBurke said, \"Hell! We ought to land somewhere and check over the ship.\nKeller, can you give me a microphone and a wavelength somebody will be\nlikely to pick up?\"\n\nKeller shrugged and picked up masses of wire. He began to work on an\nas yet unfinished wiring job. Evidently, the ship was not near enough\nto completion to be capable of a call to ground. It had taken off with\nmany things not finished. Burke, at the controls, found it possible to\nthink of a number of items that should have been examined exhaustively\nbefore the ship left the mould in which it had been made. He worried.\n\nPam said in a strange voice, \"I thought I might rate as a heroine for\nstowing away on this voyage, but I didn't think we'd have to dodge\nrockets and fighter planes to get away!\"\n\nThere was no comment.\n\n\"I'm a beginner at navigation,\" said Burke a little later, more worried\nthan before. \"I know we have to go out over the north magnetic pole,\nbut how the hell do I find that?\"\n\nKeller beamed. He dropped his wiring job and went to the imposing bank\nof electronic instruments. He set one, and then another, and then a\nthird. The action, of course, was similar to that of an airline pilot\nwhen he tunes in broadcasting stations in different cities. From each,\na directional reading can be taken. Where the lines of direction\ncross, there the transport plane must be. But Keller turned to\nshortwave transmitters whose transmissions could be picked up in space.\nPresently, eighty miles high, he wrote a latitude and longitude neatly\non a slip of paper, wrote \"North magnetic pole 93\u00b0W, 71\u00b0N, nearly,\" and\nafter that a course.\n\n\"Hm,\" said Burke. \"Thanks.\"\n\nThen there was a relative silence inside the ship. Only a faint mutter\nof voices came from assorted speakers that Keller had first turned on\nand then turned down, and a small humming sound from a gyro. When they\nlistened, they could also hear a high sweet musical tone. Burke shifted\nthis control here, and that control there, and lifted his hands. The\nship moved on steadily. He checked this and that and the other thing.\nHe was pleased. But there were innumerable things to be checked. Holmes\nwent down the ladder to the other compartment below. There were details\nto be looked into there, too.\n\nOne of the screens portrayed Earth from a height of seventy miles\ninstead of eighty, now. Others pictured the heavens, with very many\nstars shining unwinkingly out of blackness. Keller got at his wires\nagain and resumed the work of installing a ship-to-ground transmitter\nand its connection to an exterior-reflecting antenna.\n\nSandy watched Burke as he moved about, testing one thing after another.\nFrom time to time he glanced at the screens which had to serve in the\nplace of windows. Once he went back to the control-board and changed an\nadjustment.\n\n\"We dropped down ten miles,\" he explained to Sandy. \"And I suspect\nwe're being trailed by jets down below.\"\n\nHolmes meticulously inspected all storage places. He'd packed them when\nthe ship lay on her side.\n\nBurke read an instrument and said with satisfaction, \"We're running on\nsunshine!\"\n\nHe meant that in empty space certain aluminum plates on the outside\nof the hull were picking up heat from the naked sun. The use of the\ndrive-shaft lowered its temperature. Metallic connection with the\noutside plates conducted heat inward from those plates. The drive-shaft\nwas cold to the touch, but it could drop four hundred degrees\nFahrenheit before it ceased to operate as a drive. It was gratifying\nthat it had cooled so little up to this moment.\n\nLater Keller tapped Burke on the shoulder and jerked his thumb upward.\n\n\"We go up now?\" asked Burke.\n\nKeller nodded. Burke carefully swung the ship to aim vertically. The\nviews of solid Earth slid from previous screens to new ones. The stars\nand the dark object which was the sun also moved across their screens\nto vanish and reappear on others. Then Burke touched the drive-control.\nOnce more they had the sensation of being in a rising elevator. And at\njust that moment spots appeared on the barren, icy, totally flattened\nterrain below.\n\nThey were rocket-trails from target-seeking missiles which had reached\nthe area of the north magnetic pole by herculean effort and were aimed\nat the radar-detected little ship by the heavy planes that carried them.\n\nFrom the surface of the Earth, it would have seemed that monstrous\ncolumns of foaming white appeared and rose with incredible swiftness\ntoward the heavens. They reached on, up and up and up, seeming to draw\ncloser together as they became smaller in the distance, until all eight\nof them seemed to merge into a single point of infinite whiteness in\nthe sunshine above the world's blanket of air.\n\nBut nothing happened. Nothing. The ship did not accelerate as fast\nas the rockets, but it had started first and it kept up longer. It\nwent scuttling away to emptiness and the bottoms of the towers of\nrocket-smoke drifted away and away over the barren landscape all\ncovered with ice and snow.\n\nWhen Earth looked like a huge round ball that did not even seem very\nnear, with a night side that was like a curious black chasm among the\nstars, the atmosphere of tension inside the ship diminished. Keller\ncompleted his wiring of a ship-to-ground transmitter. He stood up,\nbrushed off his hands and beamed.\n\nThe little ship continued on. Its temperature remained constant. The\nair in it smelled of growing green stuff. It was moist. It was warm.\nKeller turned a knob and a tiny, beeping noise could be heard. Dials\npointed, precisely.\n\n\"We couldn't go on our true course earlier,\" Burke told Sandy, \"because\nwe had to get out beyond the Van Allen bands of cosmic particles in\norbit around the world. Pretty deadly stuff, that radiation! In theory,\nthough, all we have to do now is swing onto our proper course and\nfollow those beepings home. We ought to be in harmless emptiness here.\nDo you want to call Washington?\"\n\nShe stared.\n\n\"We need help to navigate--or astrogate,\" said Burke. \"Call them,\nSandy. I'll get on the wire when a general answers.\"\n\nSandy went jerkily to the transmitter just connected. She began to\nspeak steadily, \"Calling Earth! Calling Earth! The spaceship you just\nshot all those rockets at is calling! Calling Earth!\"\n\nIt grew monotonous, but eventually a suspicious voice demanded further\nidentification.\n\nIt was a peculiar conversation. The five in the small spaceship were\nconsidered traitors on Earth because they had exercised the traditional\nright of American citizens to go about their own business unhindered.\nIt happened that their private purposes ran counter to the emotional\nstate of the public. Hence voices berated Sandy and furiously demanded\nthat the ship return immediately. Sandy insisted on higher authority\nand presently an official voice identified itself as general so-and-so\nand sternly commanded that the ship acknowledge and obey orders to\nreturn to Earth. Burke took the transmitter.\n\n\"My name's Burke,\" he said mildly. \"If you can arrange some sort of\ncode, I'll tell you how to find the plans, and I'll give you the\ninstructions you'll need to build more ships like this. They can follow\nus out. I think they should. I believe that this is more important than\nanything else you can think of at the moment.\"\n\nSilence. Then more sternness. But ultimately the official voice said,\n\"I'll get a code expert on this.\"\n\nBurke handed the microphone to Sandy.\n\n\"Take over. We've got to arrange a cipher so nobody who listens in can\nlearn about official business. We may use a social security number for\na key, or the name of your maiden aunt's first sweetheart, or something\nwe know and Washington can find out but that nobody else can. Hm. Your\nlast year's car-license number might be a starter. They can seal up the\nrecords on that!\"\n\nSandy took over the job. What was transmitted to Earth, of course,\ncould be picked up anywhere over an entire hemisphere. Somebody would\nassuredly pass on what they overheard to, say, nations the United\nStates would rather have behind it than ahead of it in space-travel\nequipment. Burke's suggestion of a cipher and instructions changed his\nentire status with authority. They'd rather have had him come back, but\nthis was second best, and they took it.\n\nFrom Burke's standpoint it was the only thing to do. He had no official\nstanding to lend weight to his claim that lunatic magnet-cores with\ninsanely complicated windings would amount to space-drive units. If he\nreturned, in the nature of things there would be a long delay before\nmere facts could overcome theoreticians' convictions. But now he was\nforty-five thousand miles out from Earth.\n\nHe had changed course to home on the beeping signals from M-387, was\naccelerating at one full gravity and had been doing so for forty-five\nminutes. And the small ship already had a velocity of twenty miles\nper second and was still going up. All the rockets that men had made,\nplus the Russian manned-probe drifting outward now, had become as much\noutdated for space travel as flint arrowheads are for war.\n\nBurke returned to the microphone when Sandy left it to get a pencil and\npaper.\n\n\"By the way,\" he said briskly. \"We can keep on accelerating\nindefinitely at one gravity. We've got radars. We got them from--\"\nHe named the supplier. \"Now we want advice on how fast we can risk\ntraveling before we'll be going too fast to dodge meteors or whatnot\nthat the radar may detect. Get that figured out for us, will you?\"\n\nHe gave back the instrument to Sandy and returned to his inspection of\nevery item of functioning equipment in the ship. He found one or two\ntrivial things to be bettered. The small craft went on in a singularly\nmatter-of-fact fashion. If it had been a bomb shelter buried in the\npit beside the mould in which it was built, there would have been very\nlittle difference in the feel of things. The constant acceleration\nsubstituted perfectly for gravity. The six television screens, to\nbe sure, pictured incredible things outside, but television screens\noften picture incredible things. The wall-gardens looked green and\nflourishing. The pumps were noiseless. There were no moving parts in\nthe drive. The gyro held everything steady. There was no vibration.\n\nNobody could remain upset in such an unexciting environment. Presently\nPam explored the living quarters below. Holmes took his place in the\ncontrol-chair, but found no need to touch anything.\n\nSome time later Sandy reported, \"Joe, they say we must be lying, but\nif we can keep on accelerating, we'd better not hit over four hundred\nmiles a second. They say we can then swing end for end and decelerate\ndown to two hundred, and then swing once more and build up to four\nagain. But they insist that we ought to return to Earth.\"\n\n\"They don't mention shooting rockets at us, do they?\" asked Burke. \"I\nthought they wouldn't. Just say thanks and go on working out a code.\"\n\nSandy set to work with pencil and paper. Federal agents would be\nmoving, now, to impound all official records that were in any way\nconnected with any of the five on the ship. The key to the code would\nbe contained in such records. It would be an agglomeration of such\nitems as Burke's grandmother's maiden name, Holmes' social-security\nnumber, the name of a street Burke had lived on some years before,\nthe exact amount of his federal income taxes the previous year, the\ntitle of a book third from the end on the second shelf of a bookcase\nin Keller's apartment, and such unconsidered items as most people can\nremember with a little effort, but which can only be found out by\npeople who know where to look. These people would keep anybody else\nfrom looking in the same places. Such a code would be clumsy to work\nwith, but it would be unbreakable.\n\nIt took hours to establish it without the mention of a single word\nincluded in the lengthy key. The ship reached four hundred miles a\nsecond, turned about, and began to cut down its speed again.\n\nPam spoke from beside an electric stove, \"Dinner's ready! Come and get\nit!\"\n\nThey dined; Sandy weary, Burke absorbed and inevitably worried, Holmes\nplacid and amiable, and Keller beaming and interested in all that went\non, which was practically nothing.\n\nThey did not see the stars direct, because television cameras were\npreferable to portholes. Earth had become very small, and as it swung\never more nearly into a direct line between the ship and the sun,\nnight filled more of its disk until only a hairline of sunshine showed\nat one edge. The microwave receivers ceased to mutter. The working\nastronomers on Earth who'd sent a message to M-387 were suddenly\nrelieved of their disgrace and set to work again to equip the West\nVirginia radar telescope for continuous communication with Burke's\nship. Other technicians began to prepare multiple receptors to pick\nup the ship's signals from hitherto unprecedented distances for human\ntwo-way communication.\n\nAnd on Earth an official statement went out from high authority. It\nannounced that a hurriedly completed American ship was on the way to\nM-387 to investigate the signals from space. It announced that measures\nlong in preparation were now in use, and that an invincible fleet of\nspacecraft would be completed in months, whereas they had not been\nhoped for for another generation. An unexpected breakthrough had made\nit possible to advance the science of space travel by many decades,\nand a fleet to explore all the planets as well as M-387 was already\nunder construction. It was almost true that they were. The blueprints\nof Burke's ship had been flown to Washington from the plant, and an\nenormous number of replicas of the egg-shaped vessel were ordered to be\nbegun immediately, even before the theory of the drive was understood.\n\nThere was one minor hitch. A legal-minded official protested that\nCongressional appropriations had been for rocket-driven spaceships\nonly, and the money appropriated could not be used for other than\nrockets. An executive order settled the matter. Then theorists began to\nobject to the principle of the drive. It contradicted well-established\nscientific beliefs. It could not work.\n\nIt did, but there was violent opposition to the fact.\n\nPublicly, of course, the shock of such an about-face by the national\ngovernment was extreme. But newspapers flashed new headlines. \"U.S.\nSHIP SPEEDING TO QUERY ALIENS!\" Lesser heads announced, \"_Critical\nVelocity Exceeded! Russian Probe Already Passed!_\" The last was not\nquite true. The Russian manned probe had started out ten days before.\nBurke hadn't overtaken it yet.\n\nBroadcasters issued special bulletins, and two networks canceled top\nevening programs to schedule interviews with prominent scientists who'd\nhad nothing whatever to do with what Burke had managed to achieve.\n\nIn Europe, obviously, the political effect was stupendous. Russia\nwas reduced to impassioned claims that the ship had been built from\nRussian plans, using Russian discoveries, which had been stolen\nby imperialistic secret agents. And the heads of the Russian spy\nsystem were disgraced for not having, in fact, stolen the plans and\ndiscoveries from the Americans. All other operatives received threats\nof what would happen to them if they didn't repair that omission. These\nthreats so scared half a dozen operatives that they defected and told\nall they knew, thereby wrecking the Russian spy system for the time\nbeing.\n\nEssentially, however, the recovery of confidence in America was as\nextravagant as the previous unhappy desire to hear no more about\nspace. Burke, Holmes, Keller, Sandy and Pam became national heroes and\nheroines within eighteen hours after guided missiles had failed to\nshoot them down. The only criticism came from a highly conservative\nclergyman who hoped that other young girls would not imitate Sandy's\nand Pam's disregard of convention and maintained that a married woman\nshould have gone along to chaperon them.\n\nThe atmosphere in the ship, however, was that of respectability carried\nto the point where things were dull. The lower compartment of the ship,\nbeing smaller, was inevitably appropriated by Sandy and Pam. They\nretired when the ship was twenty hours out from Earth. Each of them had\nprepared for stowing away by wearing extra garments in layers.\n\n\"Funny,\" said Pam, yawning as they made ready to turn in, \"I thought it\nwas going to be exciting. But it's just like a rather full day at the\noffice.\"\n\n\"Which,\" said Sandy, \"I'm quite used to.\"\n\n\"I do think you ought to have barged in when they designed the ship,\nSandy. There's not one mirror in it!\"\n\nIn the upper compartment Keller took his place in the control-chair and\ntook a trick of duty. It consisted solely of looking at the instruments\nand listening to the beeping noises which came from remoteness every\ntwo seconds, and the still completely cryptic broadcasts which came\nevery seventy-nine minutes. It wasn't exciting. There was nothing to be\nexcited about. But somebody had to be on watch.\n\nOn the second day out, Washington was ready to use the new code. The\nWest Virginia radar bowl was powered to handle communications again.\nSandy painstakingly took down the gibberish that came in and decoded\nit. From then on she worked at the coding and transmission of messages\nand the reception and decoding of others. Presently Pam relieved her at\nthe job. Pam tended to be bored because Holmes was as much absorbed in\nthe business of keeping anything from happening as was Burke.\n\nThe messages were almost entirely requests for, and answers to requests\nfor, details about the ship plans. The United States had not yet\ncompleted a duplicate drive-shaft. Machinists labored to reproduce\nthe cores, which would then have to be wound in the complicated\nfashion the plans described. But it was an unhappy experience for the\nscientific minds assigned to duplicate Burke's ship. No woman ever\nfollowed a recipe without making some change. Very few physicists can\nduplicate another's apparatus without itching to change it. There were\nsix copies of the drive under construction at the same time, at the\nbeginning. Four were made by skeptics, who adhered to the original\nplans with strict accuracy. They were sure they'd prove Burke wrong.\nTwo were \"improved\" in the making. The four, when finished, worked\nbeautifully. The two doctored versions did not. But still there was\nfretful discussion of the theory of the drive. It seemed flatly to\ncontradict Newton's law that every action has a reaction of equal\nmoment and opposite sign--a law at least as firmly founded as the law\nof the conservation of energy. But that had lately been revised into\nthe law of the conservation of energy and matter, which now was gospel.\nBurke's theory required the Newtonian law to be restated to read \"every\naction of a given force has a reaction of the same force, of the same\nmoment,\" and so on. When the reaction of one force is converted into\nanother force, the results can be interesting. In fact, one can have\na space-drive. But there was bitter resistance to the idea. It was\ndemanded that Burke justify his views in a more reasonable way than by\nmere demonstration that they worked.\n\nAfter a time, Burke gave up trying to explain things. And when one and\nthen another duplicate drive worked, the argument ceased. But eminent\nphysicists still had a resentful feeling that Burke was cheating on\nthem somehow.\n\nThen for days nothing happened. One of the three men in the ship always\nstayed in the control-chair where he could check the ship's course\nagainst the homing signals from the asteroid. He might have to correct\nit by the fraction of a hair, or swing ship and put on more drive\nif the radar should show celestial debris in the spaceship's path.\nEvery so many hours the ship had to be swung about so that instead of\naccelerating she decelerated, or instead of decelerating gained fresh\nspeed. But that was all.\n\nOn the fifth day there was the flash of a meteor on the radar. On\nthe seventh day an object which could have been the second or third\nunmanned Russian probe showed briefly at the very edge of the radar\nscreens. In essence, however, the journey was pure tedium. Burke\nwearied of making sure that his work was good, though he congratulated\nhimself that nothing did happen to break the monotony. Holmes admitted\nthat he was disappointed. He'd wanted to make the journey because he'd\nsailed in everything but a spaceship. But there was no fun in it.\nKeller alone seemed comfortably absorbed. He prepared daily lists of\ninstrument-readings to be sent back to Earth. They would be of enormous\nimportance to science-minded people. They were not of interest to Sandy.\n\nEven when she talked to Burke, it was necessarily impersonal. There\ncould be no privacy which was not ostentatious. The two girls used the\nlower compartment, the three men the upper and larger one. For Sandy\nto talk privately with Burke, she'd have had to go to the small bottom\nsection of the ship. Holmes and Pam faced the same situation. It was\nuncomfortable. So they developed a perfectly pleasant habit of talking\nexclusively of things everybody could talk about. It did not bother\nKeller, who would hardly average a dozen words in twenty-four hours,\nbut Sandy muttered to herself when she and Pam retired for what was a\nship-night's rest.\n\nWhen they went past the orbit of Mars, agitated instructions came out\nfrom Earth. The asteroid belts began beyond Mars. Elaborate directions\ncame. The ship was tracked by radar telescopes all around the world,\ndirection-finding on its transmission. Croydon kept track. American\nradar bowls picked up the ship's voice. South American and Hawaiian and\nJapanese and Siberian radar telescopes determined the ship's position\nevery time a set of code symbols reached Earth from the ship. Of\ncourse, there were also the beepings and the seventy-nine-minute-spaced\nidentical broadcasts from farther out from the sun.\n\nSomebody got a brilliant idea and authority to try it. An interview for\nbroadcast on Earth was sought with somebody on the ship. It was then a\nhundred thirty million miles from Earth, and ninety-two million more\nfrom the sun. Largely out of boredom Sandy agreed to answer questions.\nBut at the speed of light it required eleven minutes to reach her\nfrom Earth, and as long for her reply to be received. It did not make\nfor liveliness, so she spoke curtly for five minutes and stopped. She\ntalked at random about housekeeping in space. Without knowing it, she\nwas praised for her domesticity in many pulpits the following Sunday,\nand eight hundred ninety-two proposals of marriage piled up in mail\naddressed to her in care of the United States government. Twelve were\nin Russian.\n\nBut nothing really exciting happened aboard the spaceship. It was\nBurke's guess that they could go directly through the asteroid belt\nalong the plane of the ecliptic, and not get nearer than ten thousand\nmiles to any bit of shattered stone or metal in orbit out there. He was\nalmost right. There was only one occasion when his optimism came into\ndoubt.\n\nIt was on the ninth day out from Earth. Experimentally, the ship\ncoasted on attained momentum, using no drive. There was, then, no\nsubstitute for gravity and everyone and everything in the ship was\nweightless. The power obtainable from the sun as heat had dwindled\nto one-ninth of that at the Earth's distance. But what was received\ncould be stored, and was. Meanwhile the ship plunged onward at very\nnearly four hundred miles per second. Burke, Keller, and Holmes\ntogether labored over a self-contained diving suit which they hoped\ncould be used as a space suit in dire emergency and for brief periods.\nThey wanted to get the feel of using it with internal pressure and\nweightlessness as conditions. Sandy sat at the transmitter, working at\ncode which by now she heartily loathed. Pam sat in the control-chair,\nwatching the instruments.\n\nThere was a buzz. Burke snapped his head around to see the radar\nscreen. A line of light appeared on it. It aimed directly at the center\nof the screen, which meant that whatever had been picked up was on a\ncollision course with the ship. Burke plunged toward the control-chair\nto take over. But he'd forgotten the condition of no-gravity. He went\nfloating off in mid-air, far wide of the chair.\n\nHe barked orders to Pam, who was least qualified of anybody aboard\nto meet an emergency of this sort. She panicked. She did nothing.\nHolmes took precious seconds to drag himself to the controls by what\nhand-holds could be had. The glowing white line on the radar screen\nlengthened swiftly. It neared the center. It reached the center. Burke\nand Holmes froze.\n\nThere was a curious flashing change in a vision-screen. An image\nflashed into view. It was a jagged, tortured, irregularly-shaped mass\nof stone or metal, distorted in its representation by the speed at\nwhich it passed the television lens. It was perhaps a hundred yards in\ndiameter. It could never have been seen from Earth. It might circle the\nsun in its lonely orbit for a hundred million years and never be seen\nagain.\n\nIt went away to nothing. It had missed by yards or fathoms, and Burke\nfound himself sweating profusely. Holmes was deathly white. Keller very\ncarefully took a deep breath, swallowed, and went back to his work on\nthe diving-suit-qua-space-suit. Sandy hadn't noticed anything at all.\nBut Pam burst into abrupt, belated tears, and Holmes comforted her\nclumsily. She was bitterly ashamed that she'd done nothing to meet the\nemergency which came while she was at the control-board, and which was\nthe only emergency they'd encountered since the ship's departure from\nEarth.\n\nAfter that, they put on the drive and used reserve fuel. It was\nnecessary to check their speed, anyhow. They were very near the source\nof the beeping signal they'd steered by for so long. The directional\nreceiver pointed to it had long since been turned down to its lowest\npossible volume, and still the beepings were loud.\n\nOn the eleventh day after their take-off, they sighted Asteroid M-387.\nThey had traveled two hundred seventy million miles at an averaged-out\nspeed of very close to three hundred miles per second. Despite muting,\nthe beepings from the loud-speakers were monstrous noises.\n\n\"Try a call, Holmes,\" said Burke. \"But they ought to know we're here.\"\n\nHe felt strange. He'd brought the ship to a stop about four or five\nmiles from M-387. The asteroid was a mass of dark stuff with white\noutcroppings at one place and another. The ship seemed to edge itself\ntoward it. The floating mass of stone and metal had no particular\nshape. It was longer than it was wide, but its form fitted no\ndescription. A mountain which had been torn from solidity with its\nroots of stone attached might look like Schull's Object as it turned\nslowly against a background of myriads of unblinking stars.\n\nThere was no change in the beeping that came from the singular thing.\nIt did rotate, but so slowly that one had to watch for long minutes to\nbe sure of it. There was no outward sign of any reaction to the ship's\npresence. Holmes took the microphone.\n\n\"Hello! Hello!\" he said absurdly. \"We have come from Earth to find out\nwhat you want.\"\n\nNo answer. No change in the beeping calls. The asteroid turned with\nenormous deliberation.\n\nSandy said suddenly, \"Look there! A stick! No, it's a mast! See, where\nthe patch of white is?\"\n\nBurke very, very gingerly drew closer to the monstrous thing which hung\nin space. It was true. There was a mast of some sort sticking up out\nof white stone. The direction-indicators pointed to it. The beeping\nstopped and a broadcast began. It was the standard broadcast Earth\nheard every seventy-nine minutes.\n\nThere was no reply to Holmes' call. There was no indication that\nthe ship's arrival had been noted. On Earth the ignoring of human\nbroadcasts to M-387 had seemed arrogance, indifference, a superior and\nmenacing contempt for man and all his works; somehow, here the effect\nwas different. This irregular mass was a fragment of something that\nonce had been much greater. It suddenly ceased to seem menacing because\nit seemed oblivious. It acted blindly, by rote, like some mechanism set\nto operate in a certain way and unable to act in any other.\n\nIt did not seem alive. It had signaled like a robot beacon. Now it felt\nlike one. It was one.\n\n\"Look, coming around toward us,\" said Holmes very quietly. \"There's\nsomething that looks like a tunnel. It's not a crevasse. It was cut.\"\n\nBurke nodded.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I think we'll explore it. But I don't\nreally expect we'll find any life here. There's nothing outside to see\nbut a single metal mast. We've got some signal lights on our hull. If\nwe're careful--\"\n\nNo one objected. The appearance of the asteroid was utterly\ndisappointing. Its lifelessness and its obliviousness to their coming\nand their calls were worse than disappointing. There was nothing to be\nseen but a metal stick from which signals went out to nowhere.\n\nBurke jockeyed the little ship to the tunnel-mouth. It was fully a\nhundred feet in diameter. He turned on the ship's signal lights.\nGently, cautiously, he worked down the very center of the very large\nbore.\n\nIt was perfectly straight. They went in for what seemed an indefinite\ndistance. Presently the signal lights showed that the wall was\nsmoothed. The bore grew smaller still. They went on and on.\n\nSuddenly Keller grunted. He pointed to one of the six television\nscreens which aimed out the length of the tunnel and showed the stars\nbeyond.\n\nThose stars were being blotted out. Something vast moved slowly and\ndeliberately across the shaft they navigated. It closed the opening.\nTheir retreat was blocked. The ship was shut in, in the center of a\nmountain of stone which floated perpetually in emptiness. Burke checked\nthe ship's forward motion, judging their speed by the side walls shown\nby the ship's outside lights.\n\nVery, very slowly, faint illumination appeared outside. In seconds\nthey could see that the light came from long tubes of faint bluish\nlight. The light changed. It grew stronger. It turned green and then\nyellowish and then became very bright, indeed.\n\nThen nothing more took place. Nothing whatever. The five inside\nthe ship waited more than an hour for some other development, but\nabsolutely nothing happened.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\nThere was a tiny shock; in a minute, trivial contact of the ship with\nsomething outside it. Drifting within the now brightly lighted bore, it\nhad touched the wall. There was no force to the impact.\n\nKeller made an interested noise. When eyes turned to him, he pointed to\na dial. A needle on that dial pointed just past the figure \"30.\" Burke\ngrunted.\n\n\"The devil! We've been waiting for things to happen, and they already\nhave! It's our move.\"\n\n\"According to that needle,\" agreed Holmes, \"somebody has kindly put\nthirty point seven mercury inches of air-pressure around the ship\noutside. We can walk out and breathe, now.\"\n\n\"If,\" said Burke, \"it's air. It could be something else. I'll have to\ncheck it.\"\n\nHe got out the self-contained diving apparatus that had been brought\nalong to serve as a strictly temporary space suit.\n\n\"I'll try a cigarette-lighter. Maybe it will burn naturally. Maybe it\nwill go out. It could make an explosion. But I doubt that very much.\"\n\n\"We'll hope,\" said Holmes, \"that the lighter burns.\"\n\nBurke climbed into the diving suit, which had been designed for\namateurs of undersea fishing to use in chilly waters. On Earth it\nwould have been intolerably heavy, for a man moving about out of the\nocean. But there was no weight here. If M-387 had a gravitational field\nat all, which in theory it had to have, it would be on the order of\nmillionths of the pull of Earth.\n\nKeller sat in the control-chair, watching the instruments and the\noutside television screens which showed the bore now reduced to fifty\nfeet. Somehow the more distant parts of the tunnel looked hazy, as\nif there were a slight mist in whatever gas had been released in\nit. Sandy watched Burke pull on the helmet and close the face-plate.\nShe grasped a hand-hold, her knuckles turning white. Pam nestled\ncomfortably in a corner of the ceiling of the control-room. Holmes\nfrowned as Burke went into the air-lock and closed the inner door.\n\nHis voice came immediately out of a speaker at the control-desk.\n\n\"I'm breathing canned air from the suit,\" he said curtly.\n\nThere were scrapings. The outer lock-door made noises. There was what\nseemed to be a horribly long wait. Then they heard Burke's voice again.\n\n\"I've tried it,\" he reported. \"The lighter burns when it's next to the\nslightly opened door. I'm opening wide now.\"\n\nMore noises from the air-lock.\n\n\"It still burns. Repeat. The lighter burns all right. The tunnel is\nfilled with air. I'm going to crack my face-plate and see how it\nsmells.\"\n\nSilence, while Sandy went white. But a moment later Burke said crisply,\n\"It smells all right. It's lifeless and stuffy, but there's nothing in\nit with an odor. Hold on--I hear something!\"\n\nA long minute, while the little ship floated eerily almost in contact\nwith the walls about it. It turned slowly. Then there came brisk,\nbrief fluting noises. They were familiar in kind. But this was a short\nmessage, of some fifteen or twenty seconds length, no more. It ended,\nwas repeated, ended, was repeated, and went on with an effect of\nmechanical and parrot-like repetition.\n\n\"It's good air,\" reported Burke. \"I'm breathing normally. But it might\nhave been stored for ages. It's stale. Do you hear what I do?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sandy in a whisper to the control-room. \"It's a call. It's\ntelling us to do something. Come back inside, Joe!\"\n\nThey heard the outer air-lock door closing and its locking-dogs\nengaging. The fluting noises ceased to be audible. The inner door swung\nwide. Burke came into the control-room, his helmet face-plate open. He\nwriggled out of the diving suit.\n\n\"Something picked up the fact that we'd entered. It closed a door\nbehind us. Then it turned on lights for us. Then it let air into the\nentrance-lock. Now it's telling us to do something.\"\n\nThe ship surged, ever so gently. Keller had turned on an infinitesimal\ntrace of drive. The walls of the bore floated past on the television\nscreens. There was mist in the air outside. It seemed to clear as the\nship moved.\n\nKeller made a gratified small sound. They could see the end of the\ntunnel. There was a platform there. Stairs went to it from the side of\nthe bore. There was a door with rounded corners in the end wall. That\nwall was metal.\n\nKeller carefully turned the ship until the stairway was in proper\nposition for a landing, if there had been gravitation to make the\nstairs usable. Very, very gently, he lowered the ship upon the platform.\n\nThere was a singular tugging sensation which ceased, came again,\nceased, and gradually built up to a perfectly normal feeling of weight.\nThey stood upon the floor of the control-room with every physical\nsensation they'd felt during one-gravity acceleration on the way out\nhere, and which they'd have felt if the ship were aground on Earth.\n\n\"Artificial gravity! Whoever made this knew something!\" Burke said.\n\nPam swallowed and spoke with an apparent attempt at nonchalance.\n\n\"Now what do we do?\"\n\n\"We--look for the people,\" said Sandy in a queer tone.\n\n\"There's nobody here, Sandy!\" Burke said irritably. \"Can't you see?\nThere can't be anybody here! They'd have signaled us what to do\nif there had been! This is machinery working. We do something and\nit operates. But then it waits for us to do something else. It's\nlike--like a self-service elevator!\"\n\n\"We didn't come here for an elevator ride,\" said Sandy.\n\n\"I came to find out what's here,\" said Burke, \"and why it's signaling\nto Earth. Holmes, you stay here with the girls and I'll take a look\noutside.\"\n\n\"I'd like to mention,\" said Holmes drily, \"that we haven't a weapon on\nthis ship. When they shot rockets at us back on Earth, we didn't have\neven a pea-shooter to shoot back with. We haven't now. I think the\ngirls are as safe exploring as they are here. And besides, we'll all\nfeel better if we're together.\"\n\n\"I'm going!\" said Sandy defiantly.\n\nBurke hesitated, then shrugged. He unlatched the devices which kept\nboth doors to the air-lock from being open at the same time. It was\nnot a completely cautious thing to do, but caution was impractical.\nThe ship was imprisoned. It was incapable of defense. There was simply\nnothing sensible about precautions that couldn't prevent anything.\n\nBurke threw open the outer lock door. One by one, the five of them\nclimbed down to the platform so plainly designed for a ship of space--a\nsmall one--to land upon. Nothing happened. Their surroundings were\ncompletely uninformative. This landing-platform might have been built\nby any race on Earth or anywhere else, provided only that it used\nstairs.\n\n\"Here goes,\" said Burke.\n\nHe went to the door with rounded corners. There was something like a\nhandle at one side, about waist-high. He put his hand to it, tugged\nand twisted, and the door gave. It was not rusty, but it badly needed\nlubrication. Burke pulled it wide and stared unbelievingly beyond.\n\nBefore him there stretched a corridor which was not less than twenty\nfeet high and just as wide. The long, glowing tubes of light that\nilluminated the ship-tunnel were here, too, fixed in the ceiling. The\ncorridor reached away, straight and unbroken, until its end seemed a\nmere point in the distance. It looked about a full mile long. There\nwere doorways in both its side walls, and they dwindled in the distance\nwith a monotonous regularity until they, too, were mere vertical\nspecks. One could not speak of the length of this corridor in feet or\nyards. It was a mile.\n\nIt was incredible. It was overwhelming. And it was empty. It shone in\nthe glare of the light tubes which made a river of brilliance overhead.\nIt seemed preposterous that so vast a construction should have no\nliving thing in it. But it was absolutely vacant.\n\nThey stared down its length for long seconds. Then Burke seemed to\nshake himself.\n\n\"Here's the parlor. Let's walk in, even if there's no welcoming\ncommittee.\"\n\nHis voice echoed. It rolled and reverberated and then diminished very\nslowly to nothing.\n\nBurke strode forward with Sandy close to him. Pam stared blankly, and\ninstinctively moved up to Holmes. Once they were through the door, the\nsensation was not that of adventure in a remote part of space, but of\nbeing in some strange and impossible monument on Earth. The feeling of\nweight, if not completely normal, was so near it as not to be noticed.\nThey could have been in some previously unknown structure made by men,\nat home.\n\nThis corridor, though, was not built. It was excavated. Some process\nhad been used which did not fracture the stone to be removed. The\nsurface of the rock about them was smooth. In places it glittered.\nThe doorways had been cut out, not constructed. They were of a size\nwhich made them seem designed for the use of men. The compartments to\nwhich they gave admission were similarly matter-of-fact. They were\nwindowless, of course, but their strangeness lay in the fact that they\nwere empty, as if to insist that all this ingenuity and labor had been\nabandoned thousands of years before. Yet from somewhere in the asteroid\na call still went out urgently, filling the solar system with plaintive\nfluting sounds, begging whoever heard to come and do something which\nwas direly necessary.\n\nA long, long way down the gallery there were two specks. A quarter-mile\nfrom the entrance, they saw that one of the rooms contained a pile of\nmetal ingots, neatly stacked and bound in place by still-glistening\nwire. At half a mile they came upon the things in the gallery itself.\nOne was plainly a table with a single leg, made of metal. It was\nunrusted, but showed signs of use. The other was an object with a\nhollow top. In the hollow there were twisted, shriveled shreds of\nsomething unguessable.\n\n\"If men had built this,\" said Burke, and again his voice echoed and\nrolled, \"that hollow thing would be a stool with a vanished cushion,\nand the table would be a desk.\"\n\nSandy said thoughtfully, \"If men had built this, there'd be signs\nsomewhere marking things. At least there'd be some sort of numbers on\nthese doorways!\"\n\nBurke said nothing. They went on.\n\nThe gallery branched. A metal door closed off the divergent branch.\nBurke tugged at an apparent handle. It did not yield. They continued\nalong the straight, open way.\n\nThey came to a larger-than-usual opening in the side wall. Inside it\nthere were rows and rows and rows of metal spheres some ten feet in\ndiameter. There must have been hundreds of them. Beside the door there\nwas a tiny shelf, with a tinier box fastened to it. A long way farther,\nthey came to what had appeared to be the end of this corridor. But it\ndid not end. It slanted upward and turned and they found themselves in\nthe same corridor on a different level, headed back in the direction\nfrom which they had come. Their footsteps echoed hollowly in the\nstill-enormous emptiness. There were other closed doors. Burke tried\nsome. Holmes tried others. They did not open. Keller moved raptly,\ngazing at this and that.\n\nEverything was strange, but not strange enough to be frightening. One\ncould have believed this place the work of men, except that this\nwas beyond the ability of men to make. There must be miles of vacant\nrooms carved out of solid rock. They came upon some hundreds of yards\nof doorways, and in every room on which they opened, there were metal\nframes about the walls. Holmes said suddenly, \"If men had built this\nplace, those could be bunks.\"\n\nThey came to another place where there was dust, and a group of six\nhuge rooms communicating not only with the corridor but with each\nother. They found hollow metal things like cook pans. They found a\nhollow small object which could have been a drinking vessel. It was\nbroken. It was of a size suitable for men.\n\n\"If men built this,\" said Holmes again, \"these could be mess-halls. But\nI agree with Sandy that there should be signs.\"\n\nYet another closed door. It resisted their efforts to open it, just\nlike the others. Keller put out his hand and thoughtfully touched the\nstone beside it. He looked astonished.\n\n\"What?\" asked Burke. He touched the stone as Keller had. It was\nbitterly, bitterly cold. \"The air's warm and the stone's cold! What's\nthis?\"\n\nKeller wetted the tip of his finger and rubbed it on the rocky side\nwall. Instantly, frost appeared. But the air remained warm.\n\nThe gallery turned again, and again rose. The third-level passageway\nwas shorter; barely half a mile in length. Here they passed door after\ndoor, all open, with each compartment containing a huge and somehow\nmalevolent shape of metal. And beside each doorway there was a little\nshelf with a small box fastened to it.\n\n\"These,\" said Holmes, \"could be guns, if there were any way for them to\nshoot anything. Just by the look of them I'd say they were weapons.\"\n\nBurke said abruptly, \"Keller, the stone being freezing cold while the\nair's warm means that this place has been heated up lately. Heat's been\npoured into it. Within hours!\"\n\nKeller considered. Then he shook his head.\n\n\"Not heat. Warmed air.\"\n\nBurke went scowling onward. He followed, actually, the only route\nthat was open. Other ways were cut off by doors which refused to\nopen. Sandy, beside him, noted the floor. It was stone like the walls\nand ceiling. But it was worn. There were slight inequalities in it,\nbeginning a foot or so from the walls. Sandy envisioned thousands of\nfeet moving about these resonant corridors for hundreds or thousands\nof years in order to wear away the solid stone in this fashion.\nShe felt age about her--incredible age reaching back to time past\nimagining, while the occupants of this hollow world swarmed about its\ninterior. Doing what?\n\nBurke considered other things. There were the ten-foot metal spheres,\nranged by hundreds in what might be a magazine below. There were the\nsquat and ugly metal monsters which seemed definitely menacing to\nsomebody or something. There were the metal frameworks like bunks.\nThere was no rust, here, which could be accounted for if Keller\nhappened to be right and warmed air had been released lately in\ncorridors which before--for ten thousand years or more--had contained\nonly the vacuum of space. And there were those rooms which could be\nmess-halls.\n\nThese items were subject matter for thought. But if what they hinted\nat was true, there must be other specialized compartments elsewhere.\nThere must be storerooms for food for those who managed the guns--if\nthey were guns--and the spheres, and lived in the bunk-rooms and ate\nin the mess-halls. There'd be storerooms for equipment and supplies of\nall sorts. And again, if Keller were right about the air, there must be\nenormous pressure-tanks which had held the asteroid's atmosphere under\nhigh pressure for millennia, only to warm it and release it within the\nhour so that those who came by ship could use it.\n\nAn old phrase occurred to Burke. \"A mystery wrapped in an enigma.\"\nIt applied to these discoveries. Plainly the release of air had been\ndone without the command of any living creature. There could be none\nhere! As plainly, the signals from space had been begun without the\ninterposition of life. The transmitter which still senselessly flung\nits message to Earth was a robot. The operation of the ship-lock, the\nwarming of air, the lighting of the ship-lock and the corridors--all\nhad been accomplished by machinery, obeying orders given to the\ntransmitter first by some unguessable stimulus.\n\nBut why? Other mysteries aside, there had plainly been meticulous\npreparation for the welcoming of a ship from space. No, not welcoming.\nAcceptance of a ship from space. Somebody had been expected to respond\nto those plaintive fluting noises which went wailing through the solar\nsystem. Who were those waited-for visitors expected to be? What were\nthey expected to do? For that matter, what was the purpose of the\nasteroid itself? What had it been built for? At some time or another it\nmust have contained thousands of inhabitants. What were they here for?\nWhat became of them? And when the asteroid was left--abandoned--what\nconceivable situation was to trigger the transmitter to send out urgent\ncalls, and then a directional guiding-signal the instant the call was\nanswered? When Burke's ship came, the asteroid accepted it without\nquestion and carried out mechanical operations to make it possible\nfor that ship's crew to roam at will through it. What activated this\nmechanism of so many eons ago?\n\nThe five newly-arrived humans, three men and two girls, trudged along\nthe echoing gallery cut out of the asteroid's heart. Murmurous sounds\naccompanied them. Once they came to a place where a whispering-gallery\neffect existed. They heard their footsteps repeated loudly as if the\nasteroid inhabitants were approaching invisibly, but no one came.\n\n\"I don't like this!\" Pam said uneasily.\n\nThen her own voice mocked her, and she realized what it was, and\ngiggled nervously. That also was repeated, and sounded like something\nwhich seemed to sneer at them. It was unpleasant.\n\nThey came to the end of the gallery. There was a stair leading upward.\nThere was nowhere else to go, so Burke started up, Sandy close behind\nhim, and Holmes and Pam behind them. Keller brought up the rear. They\nclimbed, and small noises began to be audible.\n\nThey were fluting sounds. They grew louder as the party from Earth went\nup and up. They reached a landing, and here also there was a metal door\nwith rounded corners. Through it and from beyond it came the piping\nnotes that Burke had heard in his dream some hundreds of times and that\nlately had come to Earth from emptiness. The sounds seemed to pause and\nto begin again, and once more to pause. It was not possible to tell\nwhether they came from one source, speaking pathetically, or from two\nsources in conversation.\n\nSandy went utterly white and her eyes fixed upon Burke. He was nearly\nas pale, himself. He stopped. Here and now there was no trace of\nribbony-leaved trees or the smell of green things, but only air which\nwas stuffy and lifeless as if it had been confined for centuries. And\nthere was no sunset sky with two moons in it, but only carved and\nseamless stone. Yet there were the familiar fluting sounds....\n\nBurke put his hand to the curiously-shaped handle of the door. It\nyielded. The door opened inward. Burke went in, his throat absurdly\ndry. Sandy followed him.\n\nAnd again there was disappointment. Because there was no living\ncreature here. The room was perhaps thirty feet long and as wide.\nThere were many vision-screens in it, and some of them showed the\nstars outside with a precision of detail no earthly television could\nprovide. The sun glowed as a small disk a third of its proper diameter.\nIt was dimmer, too. The Milky Way showed clearly. And there were very\nmany screens which showed utterly clear views of the surface of the\nasteroid, all broken, chaotic, riven rock and massy, unoxydized metal.\n\nBut there was no life. There were not even symbols of life. There were\nonly machines. They noticed a large transparent disk some ten feet\nacross. Specks of light glowed within its substance. Off at one side an\nangular metal arm held a small object very close to the disk's surface,\na third of the way from its edge. It did not touch the disk, but under\nit and in the disk there was a little group of bright-red specks\nwhich quivered and wavered. They were placed in a strict mathematical\narrangement which very, very slowly changed so that it would be hours\nbefore it had completed a rotation and had exactly the same appearance\nagain.\n\nThe flutings came from a tall metal cone on the floor. Another machine\nnearby held a round plate out toward the cone. \"There's nobody here,\"\nsaid Sandy in a strange voice. \"What'll we do now, Joe?\"\n\n\"This must be the transmitter,\" he murmured. \"The sound-record for the\nbroadcasts must be in here, somehow. It's possible that this plate is a\nsort of microphone--\"\n\nKeller, beaming, pointed to a round spot which quivered with an eerie\nluminescence. It glowed more brightly and dimmed according to the\nflutings. Burke said \"The devil!\" and the round spot flickered up very\nbrightly for an instant.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Burke. \"It's a mike. It's quite likely--\" the round spot\nflared up and dimmed with the modulations of his voice--\"it's quite\nlikely that what I say goes into the broadcast to Earth.\"\n\nThe cone ceased to emit fluting noises. Burke said very steadily--and\nthe spot flickered violently with the sounds--\"I think I am\ntransmitting to Earth. If so, this is Joe Burke. I announce the arrival\nof my ship at Asteroid M-387. The asteroid has been hollowed out and\nfitted with an air-lock which admitted our ship. It is a--a--\"\n\nHe hesitated, and Holmes said curtly, \"It's a fortress.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Burke heavily. \"It's a fortress. There are weapons we\nhaven't had time to examine. There are barracks for a garrison of\nthousands. But there is no one here. It has been deserted, but not\nabandoned, because the transmitter was set up to send out a call when\nsome occasion arose. It seems to have arisen. There is a big plate\nhere which may be a star map, with a scale on which light-years may\nbe represented by inches. I don't know. There are certain bright-red\nspecks on it. They are moving. There is a machine to watch those\nspecks. Apparently it actuated the transmitter to make it call to all\nthe solar system.\"\n\nKeller suddenly put his finger to his lips. Burke nodded and said\ncurtly, \"I'll report further.\"\n\nKeller flipped over an odd switch with something of a flourish--after\nwhich he looked embarrassed. The transmitter went dead.\n\n\"He's right,\" said Holmes. \"Back home they know we're here, I suspect,\nand you've told enough to give them fits. I think we'd better be\ncareful what we say in the clear.\"\n\nBurke nodded again. \"There'll be calls from Earth shortly and we can\ndecide whether or not to use code then. Keller, can you trace the leads\nto this transmitter and find the receiver that picked up that West\nVirginia beam-signal and changed the first broadcast to the second? It\nshould be as sensitive as this transmitter is powerful.\"\n\nKeller nodded confidently.\n\n\"It'll take thirty-some minutes for that report of mine to reach Earth\nand an answer to get back,\" observed Burke, \"if everything works\nperfectly and the proper side of Earth is turned this way. I think we\ncan be sure there's nobody but us in the fortress.\"\n\nHis sensations were peculiar. It was exciting to have found a fortress\nin space, of course. It was the sort of thing that might have satisfied\na really dedicated scientist completely. Burke realized the importance\nof the discovery, but it was an impersonal accomplishment. It did\nnot mean, to Burke, that he'd carried out the purpose behind his\ncoming here. This fortress was linked to a dream about a world with\ntwo moons in its sky and someone or something running breathlessly\nbehind unearthly swaying foliage. But this place was not the place of\nthat dream, nor did it fulfill it. Mystery remained, and frustration,\nand Burke was left in the state of mind of a savage who has found a\ntreasure which means much to civilized men, but doesn't make him any\nhappier because he doesn't want what civilized men can give him.\n\nHe grimaced and spoke without elation.\n\n\"Let's go back to the ship and get a code message ready for Earth.\"\n\nHe led the way out of this room of many motionless but operating\nmachines. The incredibly perfect vision-screen images still portrayed\nthe cosmos outside with all the stars and the sun itself moving slowly\nacross their plates. They saw sunshine and starlight shining on the\nbroken, chaotic outer surface of the asteroid. Wavering, curiously\nwrithing red specks on the ten-foot disk continued their crawling\nmotion. Keller fairly glowed with enthusiasm as he began to investigate\nthis apparatus.\n\nThey all went back to the ship, except for Keller. They retraced their\nway along the long and brilliantly lighted galleries. They descended\nramps and went along more brilliantly lighted corridors. Then they\ncame to the branch which had been blocked off by a door that would not\nopen. It was open now. They could see along the new section for a long,\nlong way. They passed places where other doors had been closed, but\nnow were open. What they could see inside them was almost exclusively\na repetition of what they saw outside of them. They passed the place\nwhere hundreds of ten-foot metal spheres waited for an unknown use.\nThey passed the table with a single leg, and the compartment with many\nmetal ingots stored in it.\n\nFinally, they came to the door with rounded corners, went through it,\nand there was their ship with its air-lock doors open, waiting in the\nbrightly lighted tunnel.\n\nThey went in, and the feeling was of complete anticlimax. They knew, of\ncourse, that they had made a discovery beside which all arch\u00e6ological\ndiscoveries on Earth were trivial. They had come upon operating\nmachines which must be old beyond imagining, unrusted because preserved\nin emptiness, and infinitely superior to anything that men had ever\nmade. They had come upon a mystery to tantalize every brain on Earth.\nThe consequences of their coming to this place would re-make all of\nEarth's future. But they were singularly unelated.\n\n\"I'll make up a sort of report,\" said Burke heavily, \"of what we saw as\nwe arrived, and our landing, and that sort of thing. We'll get it in\ncode and ready for transmission. We can use the asteroid's transmitter.\"\n\nHolmes scowled at the floor of the little ship.\n\n\"You'll make a report, too,\" said Burke. \"You realized that this is a\nfortress. There can't be any doubt. It was built and put here to fight\nsomething. It wasn't built for fun. But I wonder who it was meant to do\nbattle with, and why it was left by its garrison, and why they set up a\ntransmitter to broadcast when something happened! Maybe it was to call\nthe garrison back if they were ever needed. But thousands of years--You\nmake a report on that!\"\n\nHolmes nodded.\n\n\"You might add,\" said Pam, shivering a little, \"that it's a terribly\ncreepy place.\"\n\n\"What I don't understand,\" said Sandy, \"is why nothing's labelled.\nNothing's marked. Whoever built it must have known how to write, in\nsome fashion. A civilized race has to have written records to stay\ncivilized! But I haven't seen a symbol or a pointer or even a color\nused to give information.\"\n\nShe got out the papers on which she would code the reports as Burke\nand Holmes turned them over for transmission. She began to write out,\ncarefully, the elaborate key to the coding. Almost reluctantly, Pam\nprepared to do the same with Holmes' narrative of what he'd seen.\n\nBut if enthusiasm was tempered in the ship, there was no such reserve\nin the United States. Burke's voice had cut into one of the space\nbroadcasts which arrived every seventy-nine minutes. There had been the\nusual cryptic, plaintive piping noises, repeating for the thousandth\ntime their meaningless message. Then a human voice said almost\ninaudibly, \"_... 'll we do now, Joe?_\" It was heard over an entire\nhemisphere, where satellite-tracking stations and radar telescopes\nlistened to and recorded every broadcast from space.\n\nIt was a stupendous happening. Then Burke's voice came through the\nflutings. \"_This must be the transmitter. The sound-record for the\nbroadcasts must be in here, somehow. It's quite possible that this\nplate is a sort of microphone...._\" A few seconds later he was heard to\nsay, \"_The devil!_\" And later still he addressed himself directly to\nhis listeners on Earth.\n\nHe'd spoken the words eighteen and a fraction minutes before they\narrived, though they traveled at the speed of light. Broadcast and\necstatically reported in the United States, they touched off a popular\nreaction as widespread as that triggered by the beginning of the\nsignals themselves. Broadcasters abandoned all other subject matter.\nAnnouncers with lovely diction stated the facts and then expanded\nthem into gibbering nonsense. Man had reached M-387. Man had spoken\nto Earth across two hundred seventy million miles of emptiness. Man\nhad taken possession of a fortress in space. Man now had an outpost, a\nstepping-stone toward the stars. Man had achieved.... Man had risen....\nMan now took the first step toward his manifest destiny, which was to\noccupy and possess all the thousands of thousands of planets all the\nway to the galaxy's rim.\n\nBut this was in the United States. Elsewhere, rejoicing was much less,\nespecially after a prominent American politician was reported to have\nsaid that America's leadership of Earth was not likely ever to be\nchallenged again. A number of the smaller nations immediately protested\nin the United Nations. That august body was forced to put upon its\nagenda a full-scale discussion of U.S. space developments. Middle\nEuropean nations charged that the purpose of America was to monopolize\nnot only the practical means of traveling to other members of the\nsolar system, but all natural and technical resources obtained by such\njourneyings. With a singular unanimity, the nations at the edge of the\nRussian bloc demanded that there should be equality of information on\nEarth. No nation should hold back scientific information. In fact,\nthere was bitter denunciation of the use of code by the humans now on\nM-387. It was demanded that they answer in the clear all scientific\ninquiries made by any government--in the clear so everybody could\neavesdrop.\n\nIn effect, the United States rejoiced in and boasted of the\nachievements of some of its citizens who, after escaping attack by\nAmerican guided missiles, had found a stepping-stone toward the stars.\nBut the rest of the world jealously demanded that the United States\nreap no benefit from the fact. International tension, in fact, rose to\na new high.\n\nAnd Burke and the others laboriously gathered this bit of information\nand discovered the lack of that. They found incredible devices whose\npurpose or workings they could not understand. They found every\npossible evidence of a civilization beside which that of Earth was\nintolerably backward. But the civilization had abandoned the asteroid.\n\nBy the second day the mass of indigestible information had become\nalarming. They could marvel, but they could not understand. And not\nto understand was intolerable. They could comprehend that there was\na device with red sparks in it which had made another device send a\nfluting, plaintive call to all the solar system. Nothing else was\nunderstandable. The purpose of the call remained a mystery.\n\nBut the communicators hummed with messages from Earth. It seemed\nthat every radar telescope upon the planet had been furnished with a\ntransmitter and that every one bombarded the asteroid with a tight beam\ncarrying arguments, offers, expostulations and threats.\n\n\"This ought to be funny,\" said Burke dourly. \"But it isn't. All we know\nis that we've found a fortress which was built to defend a civilization\nabout which we know nothing except that it isn't in the solar system.\nWe know an alarm went off, to call the fortress' garrison back to\nduty, but the garrison didn't come. We did. We've some evidence that\na fighting fleet or something similar is headed this way and that it\nintends to smash this fortress and may include Earth. You'd think that\nthat sort of news would calm them down, on Earth!\"\n\nThe microwave receiver was so jammed with messages that there was no\ncommunication at all. None could be understood when all arrived at\nonce. Burke had to send a message to Earth in code, specifying a new\nand secret wavelength, before it became possible to have a two-way\ncontact with Earth. But the messages continued to come out, every one\nclamoring for something else of benefit to itself alone.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\nIn the beginning there was nothing at all, and then things were\ncreated, and the wonder of created things was very great. When men\nbecame, they marveled at the richness and the beauty about them, and\ntheir lives were filled with astonishment at the myriads of things in\nthe air and on the earth and in the sea. For many centuries they were\nbusy taking note of all the created things that were. They forgot that\nthere was such a condition as emptiness.\n\nBut there were six people in a certain solar system who really knew\nwhat emptiness amounted to. Five of them were in a fortress which was\nan asteroid and a mystery. One was in a small, crude object which\nfloated steadily out from Earth. This one's name was Nikolai. The\nrest of it does not matter. He had been born in a small village in\nthe Urals, and as a little boy he played games with mud and reeds and\nsticks and dogs and other little boys. As a growing youth he dutifully\nstuffed his head with things out of books, and some seemed to him\nrational and marvelous, and some did not make much sense but were\nbelieved by everybody. And who was he to go against the wise comrades\nwho ran the government and protected the people from wars and famines\nand the schemes of villainous capitalists?\n\nAs a young man he was considered promising. If he had been interested\nin such matters, he might have had a moderately successful career in\npolitics, as politics was practised in his nation. But he liked things.\nReal things.\n\nWhen he was a student in the university he kept a canary in his\nlodgings. He loved it very much. There was a girl, too, about whom\nhe dreamed splendidly. But there was a need for school teachers in\nBessarabia, and she went there to teach. She wept when she left him.\nAfter that Nikolai studied with something of desperation, trying to\nforget her because he could not have her.\n\nHe thought of such past events as he drifted outward from Earth. He\nwas the passenger, he was the crew of the manned space-probe his\ngovernment had prepared to go out and investigate strange signals\ncoming from emptiness. He was a volunteer, of course. It was a great\nhonor to be accepted, and for a while he'd almost forgotten the girl\nwho was teaching school in Bessarabia. But that was a long time\nago, now. At first he'd liked to remember the take-off, when brisk,\nmatter-of-fact men tucked him in his acceleration-chair and left him,\nand he lay staring upward in dead silence--save for the ticking of an\ninsanely emotionless clock--until there was a roar to end all roars\nand a shock to crush anything made of flesh and bones, and then a\nterrible, horrible feeling of weight that kept on and on until he lost\nconsciousness.\n\nHe could remember all this, if he chose. He had a distinct recollection\nof coming back to life, and of struggling to send off the signal which\nwould say that he had survived the take-off. There were telemetering\ndevices which reported what information was desired about the bands\nand belts of deadly radiation which surrounded the planet Earth. But\nNikolai reported by voice, because that was evidence that he had passed\nthrough those murderous places unharmed. And his probe went on and on\noutward, away from the Earth and the sun.\n\nHe received messages from Earth. Tinny voices assured him that his\nlaunching had gone well. His nation was proud of him. Enormous rewards\nawaited him on his return. Meanwhile--The tinny voices instructed him\nin what he was to say for them to record and broadcast to all the world\nin his honor.\n\nHe said it, with the Earth a small crescent-shaped bit of brightness\nbehind him. He drifted on. The crescent which was Earth grew smaller\nand smaller as days went by. He took due care of the instruments of his\nspace-vehicle. He made sure that the air apparatus behaved properly.\nHe disposed of wastes. From time to time he reported, by voice,\ninformation which automatic devices had long since given in greater\ndetail and with superior accuracy.\n\nAnd he thought more and more about the girl--teaching school in\nBessarabia--and his canary, which had died. Days went by. He was\ninformed that it was time for him to make contact with a drone\nfuel-rocket sent on before him. He watched the instruments which would\npoint out where it was.\n\nHe found it, and with small auxiliary rockets he made careful tiny\nblastings which guided his vehicle to contact with it. The complex\nmachinery for refueling took effect. Presently he cast off the emptied\ndrone, aimed very, very carefully and blasted outward once more. The\nshock was worse than that on Earth, and he knew nothing for a long,\nlong time. He was horribly weak when he regained consciousness. He\nmentioned it in his reports. There was no comment on the fact in the\nreplies he received from Earth.\n\nHe continued to float away from the sun. It became impossible to pick\nout Earth among the stars. The sun was smaller than he remembered.\nThere was nothing to be seen anywhere but stars and more stars and the\ndwindling disk of the sun that used to rise and set but now remained\nstationary, shrinking.\n\nSo Nikolai came to know emptiness. There were points of light which\nwere stars. They were illimitable distances away. In between was\nemptiness. He had no sensation of movement. Save that as days went\nby the sun grew smaller, there was no change in anything. All was\nemptiness. If his vehicle floated like this for ten thousand times ten\nthousand years, the stars would appear no nearer. If he got out and\nran upon nothingness to get back to where he could see Earth again, he\nwould have to run for centuries, and generations would die and nations\nfall before he caught the least glimmer of that thin crescent which was\nhis home.\n\nIf he shouted, no man would ever hear, because emptiness does not\ncarry sound. If he died, there was no earth into which his body could\nbe lowered. If he lived, there was nowhere he could stand upright\nand breathe clean air and feel solidity beneath his feet. He had a\ndestination, to be sure, but he did not really believe that he would\never reach it, nor did he imagine he would ever return. Now he\ndismissed it from his thoughts.\n\nHe found that he was feverish, and he mentioned it when the tinny\nvoices talked urgently to him. He guessed, without emotion, that he had\nnot passed through the deadly radiation-belts around Earth unburned.\nHe had been assured that he would pass through them so swiftly that\nthey would be quite harmless. Now he knew that this was a mistake. His\nbody obeyed him only sluggishly. He was dying of deep-seated radiation\nburns. But he felt nothing.\n\nVoices waked him to insist that he make contact with another\nfuel-drone. He exhausted himself as he dutifully obeyed commands. He\nwas clumsy. He was feeble. But he managed a second refueling. And even\nas he performed the highly technical operation with seemingly detached\nand reluctant hands, he thought of a schoolteacher in Bessarabia.\n\nBefore he fired the new fuel which would send him onward at what\nwould be more than escape velocity, he almost humorously--yet quite\nhumorlessly--reviewed his life. He considered that he might have no\nlater opportunity to do so. There were three things he had done which\nno man had done before him. He had loved a certain small canary, and\nhe remembered it distinctly. He had loved a certain girl, and in his\nweakened and dying state he could see her much more clearly than the\ngrubby interior of the space-probe. And the third thing--\n\nHe had to cast about in his mind to remember what it was. His hand\npoised upon the rocket-firing key, he debated. Ah, yes! The third thing\nwas that he had learned what emptiness was.\n\nHe pressed the firing-key. And the space-probe spouted flames and went\non. Before the fuel was exhausted it had reached a velocity so great\nthat it would go on forever through interstellar space. It would never\nfall back toward the sun, not even after thousands of years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe knowledge of emptiness possessed by the five in the asteroid was\ndifferent. A totally empty room is intimidating. A vacant house is\ndepressing. The two-mile-long asteroid, honeycombed with tunnels and\ncorridors and galleries and rooms, was like a deserted city. Those who\nhad left it had carefully stripped it of personal possessions, but\nthey'd left weapons behind, ready to be manned and used. They'd left\na warning device to call them. The recall device was proof that the\ndanger had not been destroyed and might return. And the plaintive call\nthrough all the solar system proved that it was returning.\n\nThere was irony in the fact that Earth had panicked when it seemed\nthat intelligent non-human beings signaled from space, and that shrill\ndisputes for advantage began instantly Burke reported no living\nmonsters at the signals' source. The fortress and its call meant\nmore than the mere existence of aliens. It was proof that there were\nentities of space who needed to be fought. It proved the existence of\nfighting ships of space; of deadly war in emptiness; of creatures who\ncrossed the void between star systems to conquer and to murder and\ndestroy.\n\nAnd such creatures were coming.\n\nBurke ground his teeth. Earth had fusion bombs and rockets which could\ncarry them for pitifully short distances on the cosmic scale. This\nfortress was incomparably more powerful than all of Earth's armament\nput together. A fleet which dared to attack it must feel itself\nstronger still. What could Earth do against a fleet which dared attack\nthis asteroid?\n\nAnd what could he and Holmes and Keller do against such a fleet, even\nwith the fortress, when they did not yet understand a single one of its\nweapons?\n\nBurke worked himself to exhaustion, trying to unravel even the simplest\nprinciples of the fortress' armament. There were globes which were,\nobviously, the long-range weapons of the garrison. They were stored in\na launching-tube at the far back of the compartment. But Keller could\nnot unravel the method of their control. There was no written matter\nin the fortress. None. A totally unknown language and an unfamiliar\nalphabet would prevent written matter from being useful, ordinarily,\nbut in technical descriptions there are bound to be diagrams. Burke\nfelt desperately that in even the most meaningless of scripts there\nwould be diagrams which could be puzzled out. But there was nothing.\nThe builders of the fortress could have been illiterate, for all the\nsigns of writing that they'd left.\n\nKeller continued to labor valiantly. But there was no clue to the\noperation of anything but the transmitter. That was understandable\nbecause one knew where the message went in, and where it came out for\nbroadcast. With the apparatus before one, one could deduce how it\noperated. But no one could guess how weapons were controlled when he\nhadn't the least idea of what they did.\n\nOn the third night in the asteroid--the third night by ship-time, since\nthere was neither day nor night in the great empty corridors of the\nfortress--Burke dreamed his dream again. It was perfectly familiar,\nfrom the trees with their trailing leaves, to the markings on the\nlarger moon. He felt the anguished anxiety he'd so often known before.\nHe grasped the hand-weapon and knew that he was ready to fight anything\nimaginable for the person he feared for. He heard small fluting sounds\nbehind him, and then he knew that someone ran breathlessly behind the\nswaying foliage just ahead. He felt such relief and exultation that his\nheart seemed about to burst. He gave a great shout and bounded to meet\nher--\n\nHe waked in the small ship in the entrance tunnel. All was silent.\nAll was still. The lights in the control-compartment of the ship were\nturned to dim. There was no sound anywhere. The opened air-lock doors,\nboth inner and outer, let in a fan-shaped streak of brightness which\nlay on the floor.\n\nBurke lay quiet, still wrought up by the vivid emotions of the dream.\n\nHe heard a stirring in the compartment below, occupied by Sandy and\nPam. Someone came very quietly up the ladder-like stairway. Burke\nblinked in the semi-darkness. He saw that it was Sandy. She crossed the\ncompartment to the air-lock. Very quietly, she closed the outer door\nand then the inner. She fastened them.\n\nBurke said, sitting up, \"Why'd you do that, Sandy?\"\n\nShe started violently, and turned.\n\n\"Pam can't sleep,\" she said in a low tone. \"She says the fortress is\ncreepy. She feels that there's something hiding in it, something deadly\nand frightening. When you leave the air-lock open, she's afraid. So I\nclosed it.\"\n\n\"Holmes and Keller are out,\" said Burke. \"Keller's trying to trace down\npower-leads from the instrument-room to whatever power-source warms and\nlights everything. We can't lock him out.\"\n\nSandy obediently opened the air-lock doors again. She turned toward the\nladder leading downward.\n\n\"Sandy,\" said Burke unhappily, \"I know I'm acting like a fool.\"\n\n\"You're doing all right,\" said Sandy. She paused at the top of the\nladder. \"Finding this--\" she waved her hand about her--\"ought to put\nyour name in the history books. Of course you'll be much disliked by\npeople who intended to invent space travel themselves. But you're doing\nall right.\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking of that,\" said Burke. \"I'm thinking of you. I was\ngoing to ask you to marry me. I didn't. If we live through this, will\nyou?\"\n\nSandy regarded him carefully in the dim light of the ship's interior,\nmost of which came through the air-lock doors.\n\n\"There are some conditions,\" she said evenly. \"I won't play second\nfiddle to an imaginary somebody behind a veil of dreamed-of leaves.\nI don't want to make conditions, Joe. But I couldn't stand your\nfeeling that maybe in marrying me you'd give up your chance of finding\nher--whatever or whoever she is.\"\n\n\"But I wouldn't feel that way!\" protested Burke.\n\n\"I'd believe you did,\" said Sandy. \"And it would amount to the same\nthing. I think I made a mistake in coming along in the ship, Joe.\nIf I weren't along you might have missed me. You might even--\" she\ngrimaced--\"you might even have dreamed about me. But here I am. And I\ncan't compete with somebody in a dream. I won't even try. I--I can't\nimagine marrying anybody else, but if I do get married I want to be the\nonly girl my guy dreams about!\"\n\nShe turned again to the ladder. Then said abruptly, \"You didn't ask why\nPam feels creepy, or where. There's a place up on the second gallery\nwhere there's a door that's still locked. Pam gets the shivers when she\ngoes by it. I don't. The whole place is creepy, to me.\"\n\nShe went down the ladder. Minutes later Holmes and Keller arrived.\n\nHolmes said curtly, \"The machinery in the transmitter-room reached a\nchange-point just now. Those red dots in that plastic plate apparently\nstarted the transmitter in the first place. When its calls were\nanswered it changed the broadcast, adding a directional signal. Just\nbefore we started out from Earth the red sparks passed another place\nand changed the broadcast again. Now they've passed a third place.\nWe were there when the machinery shifted all around on a signal from\nthat thing which hovers close to the red sparks and watches them. The\ntransmitter probably blasted out at four or five times its original\nvolume. There must have been a hundred thousand kilowatts in it, at\nleast. It looks serious. Whatever those red sparks represent must be\nclose.\"\n\nKeller nodded in agreement, frowning, then he and Holmes wearily\nprepared to turn in. But Burke was upset. He knew he wouldn't be able\nto sleep.\n\n\"Pam gets the creeps when she passes a certain locked door up on the\nsecond gallery. I never noticed it, but I'm going to get that door\nopen. We got to look into every compartment of this thing! There's\nbound to be something informative somewhere! Close the air-lock behind\nme so Pam can sleep.\"\n\nHe went out. Behind him, Holmes looked at Keller.\n\n\"Funny!\" he said drily. \"We're all scared. I feel uneasy all the time,\nwithout knowing why. But if he's as scared as I am, why doesn't he\nworry about going places alone?\"\n\nThe same question occurred to Burke. The atmosphere of the brightly\nlighted halls was ominous and secretive. A man alone in a vast empty\nbuilding would feel queer even in broad daylight with sunshine and\nother humans to be seen out of any window. But in this monstrous\ncomplex of tunnels and rooms carved out of solid stone, with\nuncountable millions of miles of pure emptiness without, the feeling\nof loneliness was incredible. He reflected wryly that a dog would be a\ncomforting companion to have on such a journey as his.\n\nHe went down the long gallery with doors on either side. Past the\nroom with the piled metal ingots. Past the door through which one saw\nhundreds of ten-foot metal globes. Up a ramp. Past the rooms where\nsomething like bunks must once have stood against the walls. A long\nway along this corridor. Emptiness, emptiness, emptiness. Innumerable\nechoings of his footsteps on the stone.\n\nThree times he stopped at doors that had swung shut, but none was fully\nclosed. All yielded readily. Then he came to the door Sandy had spoken\nabout. He worked the handle repeatedly. It was firmly shut. He kicked\nthe door and with a loud click it swung open.\n\nThere were lights inside this room, as everywhere else they had\nexplored. But it was nearly impossible to see any distance. This was\nan extremely long room, and it contained racks of metal which reached\nfrom floor to ceiling. Each rack was a series of shallow metal troughs,\nand in each trough there was a row of crumbly black metal cubes, very\nsystematically arranged. Each side was about three inches square, and\nthey were dull black, not glistening at all. They filled the racks\ncompletely. There were narrow aisles between the rows of racks, through\nwhich Burke could make his way easily enough, but which a more portly\nman might have found inconvenient.\n\nHe stared at a trough, and was stunned. He picked up one of the\ncubes, and immediately recognized the object in his hand. It was a\ndull-black, smudgy cube exactly like the one his uncle had brought back\nfrom the Cro-Magnon cave in France. He knew that if he dropped this\nobject--found two hundred seventy million miles from the other one--it\nwould split into thousands of tissue-thin, shiny pieces.\n\nHe did drop it. Deliberately. And it shattered into layers which lay\nlike films of mica on the floor.\n\nFor no clearly understandable reason, Burke found that his flesh\ncrawled. He had to force himself to stay in this room with so many\nthousands of the enigmatic cubes. There had been a cube of this kind\non Earth. The one he'd known as a child had belonged to a Cro-Magnon\ntribesman ten thousand, twenty thousand, how many years ago? And it\ncould only have come from this asteroid. Which meant--\n\nPresently he made his way back to the spaceship. He carried one of\nthe cubes, rather gingerly. He meant to show it to Sandy. But the\nimplications were startling.\n\nMembers of the garrison of this fortress, thousands of years gone by,\nhad visited Earth. One of them, doubtless, had carried that other\ncube. Why? When the garrison abandoned the asteroid they left these\ncubes behind. They left behind intricate machinery to call them back.\nThey left squat machines and ten-foot globes which must be weapons.\nThey left nothing that would be useful in the place to which they had\nremoved. But they'd left these cubes, hundreds of thousands of them.\n\nThe cube, then, could be anything. It could be impersonal, like\nequipment for the fortress that would be useless elsewhere. The\nfortress' equipment was designed to deal out death. Were the cubes?\nNo. Burke had owned one without damage. When that cube split into\nglistening, tissue-thin plates, no one was injured. To be sure, there\nwas his dream. But the cube wasn't a weapon. Whatever else it might be,\nit was not dangerous.\n\nHe went into the spaceship and for no reason whatever firmly locked\nboth air-lock doors. Holmes and Keller were asleep. There was no sound\nfrom the lower compartment occupied by Sandy and Pam.\n\nBurke put the black object on the control-desk. The single cube\non Earth had been meaningless. The museum which joyfully accepted\nCro-Magnon artifacts from his uncle had dismissed it as of no\nimportance. It was fit only to be given to an eleven-year-old boy. But\na roomful of such cubes couldn't be without meaning!\n\nHe dismissed this newest mystery with an almost violent effort of his\nwill. It was a mystery. Yet there was no intention to have the fortress\nseem a mystery to whoever answered its call to space. He could guess\nthat the signals were notification of some emergency which needed to be\nmet. The automatic apparatus of the ship-lock was set to aid those who\ncame in response to the call. But everything presupposed that those who\ncame would know why they came.\n\nBurke didn't. The thing must be simple, an explanation not yet thought\nof. But there was nowhere to start to think about it! His recurrent\ndream? No. That was as mysterious as the rest.\n\nBurke was very, very lonely and depressed. He could look for no help\nin solving the mystery. Earth was now past the point of conjunction\nwith M-387, and moved nearly a million miles a day along its orbit,\nwith nearly half of them away from the fortress. At the most hopeful\nestimate, it would be three months or later before an emergency space\nfleet of replicas of his own ship could lift off from Earth for here.\n\nAnd Burke was reasonably sure that the red sparks would have reached\nthe center of the disk in much less time than that. If it were in some\nfashion like a radar, making a map of the surroundings of the asteroid,\nthe observer's place would be in the middle. In that event, whatever\nthe red sparks represented would reach the fortress before more ships\ncame out from Earth.\n\nHe sat with his chin on his chest, wearily debating the impossibility\nof meeting a situation in which all humanity might well be involved.\nHis achievement of space travel provided no sense of triumph, and the\ndiscovery of the abandoned fortress produced no elation. Not when a\ndesperate emergency requiring a non-existent garrison to report for\nduty was so probable. Burke sat in the control-chair and could find no\nencouragement in any of his thoughts....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_He heard a trumpet-call and was on his feet, buckling familiar\nequipment about him. There were other figures all around in this\nbunkroom, similarly equipping themselves. Some grumbled. There was a\nrush for the doorway and he found himself one of a line of trotting\nfigures which swung sharply out the door and went swiftly down one of\nthe high-ceilinged corridors. The faces he saw were hardbitten and\nresentful. They moved, but out of habit, not choice. There were other\nlines of men in motion. Some rushed in the same direction. Others ran\nstolidly into branching corridors and were lost to sight. Up a ramp,\nwith the pounding of innumerable feet filling his ears with echoed\nsound. Suddenly there were fewer men before him. Some had darted\nthrough a doorway to the right. More vanished. He was at the head of\nhis line. He turned into the doorway next beyond, and saw a squat and\nmenacing object there. He swung up its side and seated himself. He\ndropped a helmet over his head and saw empty space with millions of\nunwinking stars beyond it. He waited. He was not Burke. He was someone\nelse who happened to be the pointer, the aimer, of the weapon he sat\nastride. This might be a drill, but it could be action._\n\n_A voice spoke inside his helmet. The words were utterly strange, but\nhe understood them. He tested the give of this lever and the response\nof that. He spoke crisply, militarily, in words that somehow meant\nthis--a word missing--was ready for action at its highest rate of fire._\n\n_Again he waited, his eyes examining the emptiness he saw from within\nhis helmet. A star winked. He snatched at a lever and centered it,\nsnapping sharp, bitten-off words. The voice in his helmet said, \"Flam!\"\nHe jerked the firing-lever and all space was blotted out for seconds by\nflaming light. Then the light faded and far, far away among the stars\nsomething burned horribly, spouting fire. It blew up._\n\n_Yet again he waited. He doggedly watched the stars, because the Enemy\nhad some way to prevent detection by regular instruments, and only\nthe barest flicker of one among myriad light-specks could reveal the\npresence of an Enemy craft._\n\n_A long time later the voice in his helmet spoke again, and he relaxed,\nand lifted the helmet. He nodded to the others of the crew of this\nweapon. Then a trumpet blew again, and he dismounted leisurely from\nthe saddle of the ungainly thing he'd fired, and he and his companions\nwaited while long lines of men filed stolidly past the doorway. They\nwere on the way back to the bunk-rooms. They did not look well-fed.\nHis turn came. His crew filed out into the corridor, now filled with\nmen moving in a bored but disciplined fashion. He heard somebody say\nthat it was an Enemy scout, trying some new device to get close to the\nfortress. Eight weapons had fired on it at the same instant, his among\nthem. Whatever the new device was, the Enemy had found it didn't work.\nBut he knew that it needn't have been a real Enemy, but just a drill.\nNobody knew when supposed action was real. There was much suspicion\nthat there was no real action. There was always the possibility of real\naction, though. Of course. The Enemy had been the Enemy for thousands\nof years. A century or ten or a hundred of quietude would not mean the\nEnemy had given up...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Burke found himself staring at the quietly glowing monitor-lights\nof his own ship's control-board. He was himself again. He remembered\nopening his eyes. He'd dozed, and he'd dreamed, and now he was awake.\nAnd he knew with absolute certainty that what he'd dreamed came from\nthe black cube he'd brought back from the previously locked-up room.\nBut there was a difference between this dream and the one he'd had for\nso many years. He could not name the difference, but he knew it. This\nwas not an emotion-packed, illusory experience which would haunt him\nforever. This was an experience like the most vivid of books. It was\nsomething he would remember, but he would need to think about it if he\nwere to remember it fully.\n\nHe sat stiffly still, going over and over this new memory, until he\nheard someone moving about in the compartment below.\n\n\"Sandy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sandy downstairs. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"I opened the door that bothered Pam,\" said Burke. Suddenly the\nimplications of what had just occurred began to hit him. This was the\nclue he'd needed. Now he knew--many things. \"I found out what the\nfortress is for. I suspect I know what the signals were intended to do.\"\n\nSilence for a moment. Then Sandy's voice. \"I'm coming right up.\"\n\nIn minutes she ascended the stairs.\n\n\"What is it, Joe?\"\n\nHe waved his hand, with some grimness, at the small black object on the\ncontrol-desk.\n\n\"I found this and some thousands of others behind that creepy door.\nI suspect that it accounts for the absence of signs and symbols. It\ncontains information. I got it. You get it by dozing near one of these\nthings. I did. I dreamed.\"\n\nSandy looked at him anxiously.\n\n\"No,\" he told her. \"No twin moons or waving foliage. I dreamed I was a\nmember of the garrison. I went through a training drill. I know how to\noperate those big machines on the second level of the corridor, now.\nThey're weapons. I know how to use them.\"\n\nSandy's uneasiness visibly increased.\n\n\"These black cubes are--lesson-givers. They're subliminal instructors.\nPam is more sensitive to such stuff than the rest of us. It didn't\naffect me until I dozed. Then I found myself instructed by going\nthrough an experience in the form of a dream. These cubes contain\nrecords of experiences. You have those experiences. You dream them. You\nlearn.\"\n\nThen he said abruptly, \"I understand my recurrent dream now, I think.\nWhen I was eleven years old I had a cube like this. Don't ask me how it\ngot into a Cro-Magnon cave! But I had it. One day it dropped and split\ninto a million leaves of shiny stuff. One got away under my bed, close\nup under my pillow. When I slept I dreamed about a place with two moons\nand strange trees and--all the rest.\"\n\nSandy said, groping, \"Do you mean it was magnetized in some\nfashion, and when you slept you were affected by it so you dreamed\nsomething--predetermined?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Burke grimly. \"The predetermined thing in this\nparticular cube is the way to operate those machines Holmes said were\nweapons.\" Then he said more grimly, \"I think we're going to have to\naccept the idea that this cube is an instruction device to teach the\ngarrison without their having to learn to read or write or think.\nThey'd have only to dream.\"\n\nSandy looked from him to the small black cube.\n\n\"Then we can find out--\"\n\n\"I've found it out,\" said Burke. \"I guessed before, but now I know.\nThere is an Enemy this fortress was built to fight. There is a war\nthat's lasted for thousands of years. The Enemy has spaceships and\nstrange weapons and is absolutely implacable. It has to be found. And\nthe signals from space were calls to the garrison of this fortress\nto come back and fight it. But there isn't any garrison any more.\nWe answered instead. The Enemy comes from hundreds or thousands of\nlight-years away, and he tries desperately to smash the defenses of\nthis fortress and others, and when he succeeds there will be massacre\nand atrocity and death to celebrate his victory. He's on the way now.\nAnd when he comes--\" Burke's voice grew harsh. \"When he comes he won't\nstop with trying to smash this place. The people of Earth are the\nEnemy's enemies, too. Because the garrison was a garrison of men!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Holmes flatly.\n\nBurke shrugged. He found that he was tense all over, so he took some\npains to appear wholly calm.\n\n\"It isn't reasonable!\" insisted Holmes. \"It doesn't make sense!\"\n\n\"The question,\" observed Burke, \"isn't whether it makes sense, but\nwhether it's fact. According to the last word from Earth, they're still\ninsisting that the ship's drive is against all reason. But we're here.\nAnd speaking of reason, would the average person look at this place and\nsay blandly, 'Ah, yes! A fortress in space. To be sure!' Would they? Is\nthis place reasonable?\"\n\nHolmes grinned.\n\n\"I'll go along with you there,\" he agreed. \"It isn't. But you say its\ngarrison was men. Look here! Have you seen a place before where men\nlived without writings in its public places? They tell me the ancient\nEgyptians wrote their names on the Sphinx and the Pyramids. Nowadays\nthey're scrawled in phone booths and on benches. It's the instinct of\nmen to autograph their surroundings. But there's not a line of written\nmatter in this place! That's not like men!\"\n\n\"Again,\" said Burke, \"the question isn't of normality, but of fact.\"\n\n\"Then I'll try it,\" said Holmes skeptically. \"How does it work?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But put a cube about a yard from your head, and doze\noff. I think you'll have an odd dream. I did. I think the information\nyou'll get in your dream will check with what you find around you. Some\nof it you won't have known before, but you'll find it's true.\"\n\n\"This,\" said Holmes, \"I will have to see. Which cube do I try it with,\nor do I use all of them?\"\n\n\"There's apparently no way to tell what any of them contains,\" said\nBurke. \"I went back to the storeroom and brought a dozen of them.\nTake any one and put the others some distance away--maybe outside the\nship. I'm going to talk to Keller. He'll make a lot of use of this\ndiscovery.\"\n\nHolmes picked up a cube.\n\n\"I'll try it,\" he said cheerfully. \"I go to sleep, perchance to dream.\nRight! See you later.\"\n\nBurke moved toward the ship's air-lock.\n\n\"Pam and I have some housekeeping to do,\" Sandy said.\n\nBurke nodded abstractedly. He left the ship and headed along the\nmile-long corridor with the turn at the end, a second level and another\nturn, and then the flight of steps to the instrument-room. As he\nwalked, the sound of his footsteps echoed and re\u00ebchoed.\n\nBehind him, Holmes set a cube in a suitable position and curled up on\none of the side-wall bunks in the upper compartment of the spaceship.\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" said Sandy.\n\nPam parted her lips to speak, and did not. They disappeared down the\nstair to the lower room. Then Sandy came back and picked up the extra\ncubes.\n\n\"Joe said to move them,\" she explained.\n\nShe disappeared again. Holmes settled himself comfortably. He was one\nof those fortunate people who are able to relax at will. Actually, in\nhis work he normally did his thinking while on his feet, moving about\nhis yacht-building plant or else sailing one of his own boats. He\nsimply was not a sit-down thinker. Sitting, he could doze at almost any\ntime he pleased, and for a yachtsman it was a useful ability. He could\ngo for days on snatched catnaps when necessary. Conversely he could\ncatnap practically at will.\n\nHe yawned once or twice and settled down confidently. In five minutes\nor less ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_He wriggled down into an opening barely large enough to admit his\nbody. The top clamped and sealed overhead. He fitted his feet into\ntheir proper stirrup-like holders and fixed his hands on the controls.\nThere was violent acceleration and he shot away and ahead. Behind him\nthe jagged shape of the fortress loomed. He swung his tiny ship. He\ndrove fiercely for the tiny rings of red glow which centered themselves\nin the sighting-screen before him. He drove and drove, while the\nfortress dwindled to a dot and then vanished._\n\n_On either side of his ship a ten-foot steel globe clung. He checked\nthem over, tense with the realization that he must very soon be within\nthe practical timing-range of the new Enemy solid missiles. He made\nminute adjustments in the settings of the globes._\n\n_He released them together. They went swinging madly away at the\nend of a hair-thin wire which would sustain the tons of stress that\ncentrifugal force gave the spheres. They spiraled toward darkness with\nits background of innumerable stars. The Enemy would be puzzled, this\ntime! They'd developed missile-weapons with computing sights. In their\nlast attack, five hundred years before, the Enemy had been defeated by\nthe self-driving globes that had an utterly incredible acceleration.\nIt was reported from the Cathor sector that in this current attack\nthey had missile-weapons with a muzzle-velocity of hundreds of\nmiles per second, which could actually anticipate a globe with a\nhundred-sixty-gravity drive. They could fire a solid shot to meet it\nand knock it down, because of some incredible computer-system which was\nable to calculate a globe's trajectory and meet it in space. They were\nsmart, the Enemy!_\n\n_The two globes went spinning toward the Enemy. Linked together, they\nspun round and round and no conceivable computer could calculate the\npath of either one so a projectile could hit. They did not travel in\na straight line, as a trajectory in space should be. Whirling as they\ndid around a common center of gravity, with the plane of their circling\nat a sharp angle to their line of flight, it was not possible to range\nthem for gunfire. Their progress was in a series of curves, each at\na different distance, which no mere calculator could solve without\ndirection. A radar could not pick up the data a computer would need.\nOne or the other globe might be hit, but it was far from likely._\n\n_The pilot of the one-man ship saw the blue-white flame of a hit. He\nflung his ship about and sped back toward the fortress. The Enemy would\nbeat this trick, in time. Four thousand years before they'd almost won,\nwhen they invaded the Old Nation. They were getting bolder now. There\nwas a time when a sound beating sent them back beyond the Coal-sack to\nlick their wounds for two thousand years or better. Lately they came\nmore often. There'd been a raid in force only five hundred years back,\nand only fifteen before that ..._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHolmes, obviously, had the odd dream Burke had prophesied. But Burke\nwas up in the instrument-room by then. Keller gazed absorbedly at\na vision-plate. It showed a section of the exterior surface of the\nasteroid--harsh, naked rock, with pitiless sunlight showing the grain\nand structure of the rock-crystals. Where there was shadow, the\nblackness was absolute. As Burke entered, Keller turned a knob. The\nimage changed to a picture of a compartment inside the fortress.\nIt was a part of the maze of rooms and galleries that none of the\nnewcomers had visited. Panels and bus-bars and things which were\nplainly switches covered its walls. It was a power-distribution center.\nKeller turned the knob back, and the view of the outside of the\nasteroid returned.\n\nKeller turned and blinked at Burke, and then said happily, \"Look!\"\n\nHe went to another vision-screen with an image of another part of\nthe outer surface. He turned that knob, and the image dissolved into\nanother. This was a gigantic room, lighted like more familiar places.\nIn its center there was an enormous, gigantic machine. There were domes\nof metal, with great rods of silvery stuff reaching across emptiness\nbetween them. There were stairs by which one could climb to this part\nand that. Judging by the steps and the size of the light-tubes, the\nmachine was the size of a four-storey house. And on the floor there\nwere smaller machines, all motionless and all cryptic.\n\nKeller said with conviction, \"Power!\"\n\nBurke stared. Keller recovered the original view and went to still\nother plates. In succession, as he turned the knobs, Burke saw\ncompartment after compartment. There was one quite as huge as the one\ncontaining the power-generating machine. It contained hemispheres\nbolted ten feet above the floor on many columns. There was a network\nof bus-bars, it seemed, overlying everything, and there were smaller\ndevices on the floor below it.\n\n\"Gravity!\" said Keller with conviction.\n\n\"Good enough,\" said Burke. \"We've found something too, which may be\nuseful with those machines. If we can--\"\n\nKeller held up his hand and went to one special screen. When he changed\nthe image, the new one was totally unlike any of the others. This was\na close-up. It showed a clumsy, strictly improvised and definitely\ncobbled metal case against a wall. It had been made by inept hands. It\nwas remarkable to see such indifferent workmanship here. But the really\nremarkable thing was that the face of the box contained an inscription,\nburned into the metal as if by a torch. The symbols had no meaning to\nBurke, of course. But this was an inscription in a written language.\n\nKeller rubbed his hands, beaming.\n\n\"It could be a message for somebody who'd come later,\" said Burke.\n\"It's hard to think of it being anything else. But it wasn't placed for\nus to find. It should have been set up beside the ship-lock we were\nexpected to come in by and did come in by.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Keller zestfully. \"Come on!\"\n\nBurke followed him. Keller seemed somehow to know the way. They went\nall the way back to the ship-lock, passed it, and then Keller dived off\nto the right, down an unsuspected ramp. There were galleries running\nin every direction here, crossing each other and opening upon an\nindefinite number of what must have been storerooms. Presently Keller\npointed.\n\nThere was the case against the wall. It faced a wide corridor. It\ndid not belong here. It was totally unlike any other artifact they\nhad seen, because it seemed to have been made totally without skill.\nYet there was an inscription--and the making of written records had\nappeared to be a skill the former occupants of the asteroid had not\npossessed. Keller very zestfully essayed to open it. He failed.\n\nBurke said, \"We'll have to use tools to get it open.\"\n\n\"Somebody made it,\" said Keller, \"just before the garrison went away.\nThey made it here!\"\n\n\"Quite likely,\" agreed Burke. \"We'll get at it presently. Now listen,\nKeller! I came along because a message might be useful. I think Holmes\nhas found out something, though what it may be I can't guess. Come\nalong with me. There've been developments and I want to hold a council\nof war. And I think I do mean war!\"\n\nHe led the way back toward the ship. When they arrived, Holmes was\nawake and growling because of Burke's absence.\n\n\"You win,\" he told Burke. \"I had a dream, and it wasn't a dream. I know\nsomething about those metal globes. They've got drives in them, and\nthey can accelerate to a hundred and sixty gees, and I don't think I'll\nride one.\"\n\nWryly, he told Burke what he'd experienced.\n\n\"I'm not too much surprised,\" said Burke. \"I've managed two\ncube-experiences myself. I figure that these cubes trained men to\noperate things, without training their brains in anything else. They'd\nmake illiterates into skilled men in a particular line, so anybody\ncould do the work a highly trained man would otherwise be needed for.\nIn one of my two cube-dreams I was a gun-pointer on one of those\nmachines up on the third level. In the second cube-dream I was a\nrocket-pilot.\"\n\n\"No rockets in my cube,\" protested Holmes.\n\n\"Different period,\" said Burke. \"Maybe, anyhow. In my dream we were\nusing rockets to fight with, and the war was close. The enemy had\ntaken some planets off Kandu--wherever that is!--and the situation\nwas bad. We went out of here in rockets and fought all over the sky.\nBut then there were supplies coming from home, and fresh fighting men\nturning up.\" He stopped abruptly. \"How'd they come? I don't know. But\nI know they didn't come in spaceships. They just came, and they were\nnew men and we veterans patronized them. The devil! Holmes, you say the\nglobes have a hundred-sixty-gee drive! Nobody'd use rockets if drives\nlike that were known!\"\n\n\"To stay in the party,\" Sandy said suddenly, with something like\ndefiance, \"I tried a cube, too. And I was a sort of supply-officer. I\nhad the experience of being responsible for supply and being short of\neverything and improvising this and that and the other to keep things\nup to fighting standard. It wasn't easy. The men grumbled, and we\nlacked everything. There was no fighting in my time, and there hadn't\nbeen for centuries. But we knew the Enemy hadn't given up and we had\nto be ready, generation after generation, even when nothing happened.\nAnd we knew that any minute the Enemy might throw something unexpected,\nsome new weapon, at us.\"\n\n\"History-cubes,\" said Keller interestedly. \"Different periods. Right?\"\n\n\"Dammit, yes!\" said Burke. \"We've got accounts of past times and\nfinished battles, but we need to know who's coming and what to do about\nit! Maybe the rocket-dream was earliest in time. But how could a race\nwith nothing better than rockets ever get here? And how could they\nsupply the building of a place like this?\"\n\nThere was no answer. Facts ought to fit together. When they don't, they\nare useless.\n\n\"We've got snatches of information,\" said Burke. \"But we don't know\nwho built this fort, or why, except that there was a war that lasted\nthousands of years, with pauses for centuries between battles.\" He\nwaved a hand irritably. \"The Enemy tries to think up new weapons.\nThey do. They try them. So far, they've been countered. But we're not\nprepared to fight a new weapon. Maybe the fort is set to battle old\nones, but we don't know how to use it even for that! We've got to--\"\n\n\"I think--\" began Keller.\n\n\"I'd give plenty for a service manual on the probably useless weapons\nwe do have,\" said Burke angrily. \"Incidentally, Keller just found what\nmay be an explanation of how and why this place was abandoned.\"\n\nKeller said suddenly, \"Where would service manuals be?\"\n\nHe moved, almost running, toward the air-lock. Burke started to swear,\nand stopped.\n\n\"A service-and-repair manual,\" he snapped, \"would be near the equipment\nit described. How many little shelves with boxes on them have we seen?\nThey're just the right size to hold cubes! And where are they? Next to\nthose fighting machines next to the door of the room where the ten-foot\nglobes are! There's a shelf of them in the instrument-room! Let's find\nout how to fight with this misbegotten shell of a space-fort! There'll\nbe no help coming to us, but if the Enemy's held off for thousands of\nyears while this civilization fell apart, we might as well try to hold\nit together for a few minutes or seconds longer! Let's go get some real\ninstruction-cubes!\"\n\nKeller was already gone. The others followed. Once they saw Keller in\nthe far, far distance, hastening toward the instrument-room. Behind\nhim, after almost running down the long corridor, Burke swung into the\nroom where hundreds of ten-foot metal globes waited for the fortress to\nbe remanned and to go into action again. Inside the door he found the\nremembered shelf, with two small boxes fastened to it. He pulled down\none box and opened it. There was a black cube inside it. He thrust it\nupon Holmes.\n\n\"Here!\" he said feverishly. \"Find out how those globes work! Find out\nwhat's in them, how they drive!\"\n\nHe ran. To the end of the corridor and up the ramp and past the\nsupposed bunk-rooms and mess-halls. Up to the level where the ugly\nmetal machines stood, each in its separate cubicle. There were little\nshelves inside each door. Each shelf contained a single box. Burke took\none, two, and then stopped short.\n\n\"They'll be practically alike,\" he muttered. \"No need.\"\n\nHe put one back. And then he felt almost insanely angry. One would need\nat least to be able to doze, to make use of the detailed, vivid, and\nutterly convincing material contained in the black cubes. And how could\nany man doze or sleep for the purpose of learning such desperately\nneeded data? He'd need almost not to want the information to be able to\nsleep to get it!\n\nSandy and Pam overtook him as he stood in harried frustration with a\nblack cube in his hands.\n\n\"Listen to me, Joe,\" said Sandy. \"We've all taken chances, but if you\nget recurrent dreams from every cube you doze near--\"\n\n\"When that happened to me,\" snapped Burke, \"I was eleven years old and\nhad one moment only. And that dream wasn't affected by the others in\nthe cubes that came after it. And anyhow, no matter what happens to\nHolmes and me, we have to get these things ready for use! I don't know\nwhat we'll use them against. I don't know whether they'll be any use at\nall. But I've got to try to use them, so I've got to try to find out\nhow!\"\n\nSandy opened her mouth to speak again.\n\n\"I'm going off to fret myself to sleep,\" added Burke. \"Holmes will be\ntrying it too. And Keller.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's necessary,\" said Sandy.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You found a sort of library of cubes. How useful would they be if one\nhad to doze off to read them? How handy would a manual about repairing\na weapon be, if somebody had to take a nap to get instructions? It\nwouldn't make sense!\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said Burke impatiently.\n\n\"Why not look in the library?\" asked Sandy. \"As a quartermaster\nofficer, I _think_ I knew that there was a reading-device for the\ncubes, like a projector for microfilm. It might have been taken away,\nbut also--\"\n\n\"Come along!\" snapped Burke. \"If that's so, it's everything! And it\nought to be so!\"\n\nThey hastened to the vast, low-ceilinged room which was filled with\nracks of black cubes. They were stacked in their places. At the far\ncorner they found a desk and a cabinet. In the cabinet they found two\nobjects like metal skull-caps, with clamps atop them. A cube would fit\nbetween the clamps. Burke feverishly sat a cube in position and put the\nskull-cap on his head. His expression was strange. After an instant he\ntook it off and reversed the cube. He put it on. His face cleared. He\nlifted it off.\n\n\"I had it on backwards the first time,\" he said curtly. \"This is better\nthan dreaming the stuff. This lets you examine things in detail. You\nknow you're receiving something. You don't think you're actually\nexperiencing. We'll get this other reading-machine to Keller, so he can\nunderstand the equipment in the instrument-room. Holmes will have to\nwait.\"\n\nSandy said, \"I can use him. Doesn't it occur to you, Joe, that we've\nonly partly explored the top half of the fortress? We've only looked\nat what's between us and the instrument-room. There are all the\nstores--there were stores! And the generators down below. I can lead\nthe way there now!\"\n\n\"What do you know about the weapons?\" demanded Burke.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Sandy. \"But I know something about the morale of the\ngarrison. When grumbling began, discipline tightened up. And that\nworked for the men, but the women--\"\n\n\"Women!\" said Pam incredulously.\n\n\"They were an experiment,\" Sandy told her, \"to see if they would\ncontent men on duty in an outpost. It'd been going on for only a few\nhundred years. It didn't seem to work too well. They wanted supplies\nthat weren't exactly military, and at the time the cube I used was\nmade, there was trouble getting even military things!\"\n\nBurke said impatiently, \"I'll get one of these things to Keller. That's\nthe most important thing. Tell Holmes not to try to sleep. Take him\ndown to look over the supplies, if there are any. I'd guess that the\ngarrison took most of them along. I doubt there's much left that we\ncould use.\"\n\nHe made his way out of the cube-library and vanished.\n\nPam said uncomfortably, \"Joe dreamed about a woman and is no good to\nyou, in consequence. If there were women in this garrison, using the\ncubes might make anybody--\"\n\nSandy tensed her lips.\n\n\"I don't think Joe is thinking about his old dream. Something deadly's\non the way here. His mind's on that. I suspect all three of the men are\nconcentrating on it. They're in no mood for romance.\"\n\n\"Don't you think I've noticed?\" Pam said gloomily. \"But I'm coming with\nyou when you show him the storerooms!\"\n\nThe \"him\" was obviously Holmes, whose attention had been so much\ntaken up by the problems the fortress presented that Pam felt pushed\nmuch farther on the side lines than she liked. It was one thing to\nbe present to watch and help and cheer on a man who planned to do\nsomething remarkable. But it was less satisfying when he became so\nabsorbed that he didn't notice being watched, and couldn't be helped,\nand didn't need to be cheered on. Pam was disgruntled.\n\nThen, for a considerable number of hours, absurdly trivial activities\nseemed to occupy all the people in the asteroid. Burke and Keller sat\nin the thirty by thirty-foot instrument-room, each wearing a small\nmetal half-cap with a black cube held atop it between a pair of clamps.\nTheir expressions were absorbed and intent, while they seemed attired\nfor a children's halloween party. Now and again one of them exchanged\none cube for another. About them there was a multiplicity of television\nscreens, each screen presenting a picture of infinitely perfect\nquality. Every square foot of the outside of the asteroid could be seen\non one or another of the screens. Then, besides, there were banks of\nscreens which showed every square degree of the sky, with every star of\nevery magnitude represented so that one could use a magnifying glass\nupon the screen to discover finer detail.\n\nOnce, during the hours when Burke and Keller were sitting quite\nstill, Keller reached over and threw a switch. Nothing happened.\nEverything went on exactly as it had done before. He shook his head.\nAnd much later he went to one of the star-image screens. He moved an\ninconspicuous knob in a special fashion, and the star-image expanded\nand expanded until what had been a second of arc or less filled all the\nscreen's surface. The effect of an incredibly powerful telescope was\nobtained by the movement of one control. Keller restored the knob to\nits original place and the image returned to its former scale. These\nwere the only actions which took place in the instrument-room.\n\nIn the lower part of the asteroid, not much more occurred. The entrance\nto the power and storage areas was not hidden. It simply had not been\nentered. Sandy and Holmes and Pam went gingerly down a corridor with\ndoors on either side, and then down a ramp, and then into huge caverns\nfilled with monstrous metal things. There was no sign of any motion\nanywhere, but gigantic power-leads led from the machines to massive\nswitchboards, whose switches were thrown by relays operated from\nsomewhere else.\n\nThen there were other caverns which must have contained many varieties\nof stores. There were great cases, broken open and emptied. There were\nbins with only dust at their bottoms. There were shelves containing\nthings which might have been textiles, but which crumbled at a touch.\nSome thousands of years in an absolute vacuum would have evaporated any\nsubstance giving any degree of flexibility. These objects were useless.\nThere was a great room with a singular hundred-foot-high machine in\nit, but there was no vibration or sound to indicate that it was in\noperation. This, Sandy said decisively, was the artificial-gravity\ngenerator. She did not know how it worked. It would have been\nindiscreet to experiment.\n\nShe led the way through relatively small corridors to areas in\nwhich there were very many small compartments. These had been for\nfoodstuffs. But they were empty. They had been emptied when the\nasteroid was abandoned.\n\nThen they came to the crudely fashioned case with the cryptic symbols\non its front.\n\n\"This is the thing Joe mentioned,\" said Sandy. \"They had writing.\nThey'd have to, to be civilized. But this is the only writing we've\nseen. Why'd they write it?\"\n\n\"To tell somebody something they'd miss, otherwise,\" Pam said.\n\n\"Who'd come down here? Why not put it at the ship-lock where people\ncould be expected to come?\"\n\nHolmes grunted. \"Asking questions like that gets nowhere. It's like\nasking how the garrison was supplied. There's no answer. Or how it\nleft.\"\n\nSandy said in a surprised voice, as if saying something she hadn't\nrealized she knew. \"There were service ships. They serviced the\ntelevision eyes on the outside, and they drilled at launching missiles,\nand so on. They were modified fighting ships, made over after ships\ndidn't fight any more.\"\n\nShe hesitated, then went on.\n\n\"It's odd that I didn't think of telling Joe this! Some of the food\nsupply came from Earth at the time my cube was made. As a quartermaster\nofficer, I was authorized to allow hunting on Earth in case of need.\nSo the serviceships went to Earth and came back with mammoths tied to\nthe outside of their hulls. They had to be re-hydrated, though. Frozen\nthough they were, they dried out in the long trip through vacuum from\nEarth.\"\n\nThen she shivered a little.\n\nPam looked at her strangely. Holmes raised his eyebrows. He'd had one\nexperience of training-cubes. Sandy'd had quite another. Holmes felt\nthat instinctive slight resentment a man feels when he lacks a position\nof authority in the presence of a woman.\n\n\"In my time--in the cube's time--there was even a hunting camp on\nEarth. Otherwise there simply wouldn't be enough to eat! Women were\nclamoring to be sent to Earth to help with the food supply. To be sent\nto hunt for food was a reward for exemplary service.\"\n\n\"Which is interesting,\" observed Holmes, \"but irrelevant. How was the\nasteroid normally supplied? How did the garrison leave? Where did it\ncome from? Where did it go? Maybe the answer's in this box. If it is,\"\nhe added, \"it'll be in the same language as the inscription, and we\ncan't read it.\"\n\nArchaeologists on Earth would have been enraptured by any part of the\nfortress, but anything which promised to explain as much as Holmes had\nguessed the case could, would be a treasure past any price.\n\nBut the five people in the asteroid had much more immediate and much\nmore urgent problems to think of. They went on a little farther and\ncame to a storeroom which had been filled with something, but now held\nonly the remains of packing-cases. They looked ready to crumble if\ntouched.\n\n\"There used to be weapons stored here,\" Sandy said. \"Hand-weapons. Not\nfor the defense of the fortress, but for the--discipline police. For\nthe men who kept the others obedient to orders.\"\n\n\"I'd be glad to have one operating pea-shooter,\" said Holmes.\n\nPam wrinkled her nose suddenly. She'd noticed something.\n\n\"I think--\" she began, \"I think--\"\n\nHolmes kicked at a shape which once was probably a case of wood or\nsomething similar. It collapsed into impalpable dust. It had dried out\nto absolute desiccation. It was stripped of every molecule which could\nbe extracted by a total vacuum in thousands of years. It was brittle\npast imagining.\n\nThe collapse did not end with the object kicked. It spread. One case\nbulged as the support of another failed. The bulged case disintegrated.\nIts particles pressed on another. The dissolution spread fanwise until\nnothing remained but a carpeting of infinitely fine brown stuff. In one\nplace, however, solid objects remained under the covering.\n\nHolmes waded through the powder to the solid things. He brought them\nup. A case of hand-weapons had collapsed, but the weapons themselves\nkept their shape. They had transparent plastic barrels with curiously\nformed metal parts inside them.\n\n\"These might be looked into,\" said Holmes.\n\nHe stuffed his pockets. The hand-weapons had barrels and handgrips and\ntriggers. They were made to shoot, somehow.\n\n\"I think--\" began Pam again.\n\n\"Don't,\" growled Holmes. \"Maybe Sandy remembers when this place was\ndifferent, but I've had enough of it as it is. Let's go back to the\nship and some fresh air.\"\n\n\"But that's what--\"\n\nHolmes turned away. Like the rest, he'd accepted great age, mentally,\nas a part of the nature of the fortress. But the collapse of emptied\nshipping-cases because they were touched was a shock. Where such\ndecay existed, one could not hope to find anything useful for a modern\nemergency. He vanished.\n\nPam was indignant. She turned to Sandy.\n\n\"I wanted to say that I smelled fresh air,\" she protested. \"And he acts\nlike that!\"\n\nSandy was not listening. She frowned.\n\n\"He could lose his way down here,\" she said shortly. \"We'd better keep\nhim in sight. I remember the way from my dream.\"\n\nThey followed Holmes, who did make his way back to the upper levels\nand ultimately to the ship without guidance. But Pam was intensely\nindignant.\n\n\"We could have gotten lost down there!\" she said angrily when they\nwere back in familiar territory. \"And he wouldn't have cared! And I\ndid smell fresh air! Not very fresh, but fresher than the aged and\ndried-out stuff we're breathing now!\"\n\n\"You couldn't,\" said Sandy practically. \"There simply couldn't be any,\nexcept in the ship where the hydroponic wall-gardens keep it fresh.\"\n\n\"But I did!\" insisted Pam.\n\nSandy shrugged. They went into the ship, which Holmes had already\nreached and where he sat gloomily beside a black cube. He would\nhave to sleep to get anything from it. There were only two of the\nfreakish-seeming metal caps which made the cubes intelligible to a man\nawake, and Burke and Keller were using them. Holmes felt offended.\n\nSandy looked at a clock and began to prepare a meal. Pam, brooding,\nhelped her.\n\nBurke and Keller came back to the ship together. Keller looked pale.\nBurke seemed utterly grim.\n\n\"There's some stuff to be coded and sent back to Earth,\" he told Sandy.\n\"Keller's got it written out. We know how to work the instruments up\nabove, now. My brain's reeling a little, but I think I'll stay sane.\nKeller takes it in stride. And we know the trick the Enemy has.\"\n\nSandy put out plates for five.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Gravity,\" said Burke, evenly. \"Artificial gravity. We don't know how\nto make it, but the people who built this fortress did, and the Enemy\ndoes. So they've made artificial-gravity fields to give their ships the\nseeming mass of suns, and they've set them in close orbits around each\nother. They'll come spinning into this solar system. What will happen\nwhen objects with the mass of suns--artificial or otherwise--come\nriding through between our sun and its planets? There'll be tidal\nstresses to crack the planets and let out their internal fires.\nThere'll be no stability left in the sun. Maybe it'll be a low-grade\nnova when they've gone, surrounded by trash that once was worlds.\nAnyhow there'll be no humans left! And then the Enemy will go driving\non toward the other solar systems that the builders of this fortress\nown. They can't conquer anything with a weapon like that, but they can\nsurely destroy!\"\n\nKeller nodded distressedly. He gave Pam a number of sheets of paper,\nfilled with his neat handwriting.\n\nHe said sorrowfully, \"For Earth. In code.\"\n\nSandy served the meal she had prepared.\n\n\"It's a matter of days,\" said Burke curtly. \"Not weeks. Just days.\"\n\nHe picked up a fork and began his meal.\n\n\"So,\" he said after a moment, with a sort of unnatural calm, \"we've got\nto get the thing licked fast. Up in the instrument-room there are some\ntheory-cubes--lectures on theories with which the operators of the room\nwere probably required to be familiar. They were intended to figure out\nwhat the Enemy might come up with, so it could at least be reported\nbefore the fortress was destroyed. The trick of sun-gravity fields\nwas suggested as possible, but it seemed preposterously difficult.\nApparently, it was. It took the Enemy some thousands of years to get\nit. But they've got it, all right!\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" demanded Holmes.\n\n\"The disk with the red sparks in it,\" said Burke, \"is a detector of\ngravity-fields. It sees by gravity, which is not radiation. Keller's\nsending instructions back to Earth telling how to make such detectors.\"\n\nHe busied himself with his food once more. After a moment he spoke\nagain.\n\n\"We're going to try to get some help,\" he observed. \"At least we'll try\nto find out if there's any help to be had. I think there's a chance.\nThere was a civilization which built this fortress. Something happened\nto it. Perhaps it simply collapsed, like Rome and Greece and Egypt and\nBabylonia back on Earth. But on Earth when an old civilization died\na new, young one rose in its place. If the one that built this fort\ncollapsed, maybe a new one has risen in its stead. If so, it will need\nto defend itself against the Enemy just like the old culture did. It\nmight prefer to do its fighting here, instead of in its own land. I\nthink we may be able to contact it.\"\n\n\"How'll you look for them?\"\n\nBurke shrugged.\n\n\"I've some faint hope of a few directions in that sealed-up metal case\nwith the inscription on it. I'm going to take some tools and break into\nit. It's a gamble, but there's nothing to lose.\"\n\nHe ate briskly, with a good appetite. Sandy was very silent.\n\nPam said abruptly, \"We saw that case. And I smelled fresh air there.\nNot pure air like here in the ship, but not dead air like the air\neverywhere else.\"\n\n\"Near a power generator, Pam, there'd be some ozone,\" Holmes said\npatiently. \"It makes a lot of difference.\"\n\n\"It wasn't ozone,\" said Pam firmly. \"It was fresh air. Not canned air.\nFresh!\"\n\nHolmes looked at Burke.\n\n\"Did you or Keller find out how the air's refreshed here? Did anybody\nthrow a switch for air apparatus?\"\n\nKeller said mildly, \"Apparatus, no. Air exchange, yes. I threw switches\nalso for communication with base. Also emergency communication. Also\ndire emergency. Nothing happened.\"\n\n\"You see, Pam?\" said Holmes. \"It was ozone that made the air smell\nfresh.\"\n\nSandy was wholly silent until the meal was over. Then Holmes went\nmoodily off with Keller, to use the cube-reading devices in the\ninstrument-room and try to find, against all apparent probability, some\nclue or some communication which would enable something useful to be\ndone. Holmes was trying hard to believe that things were not as bad as\nBurke announced, and not nearly so desperate that they had to try to\nfind the descendants of a long-vanished civilization for a chance to\noffer resistance to the Enemy.\n\nKeller said confidentially, just before they reached the\ninstrument-room, \"Burke's an optimist.\"\n\nAnd at that moment, back in the little plastic spaceship, Burke was\nsaying to Sandy, \"You can come along if you like. There are a couple of\nthings to be looked into. And if you want to come, Pam--\"\n\nBut Pam touched the papers Keller had given her and said reservedly,\n\"I'll code and send this stuff. Go ahead, Sandy.\"\n\nSandy rose. She followed Burke out of the ship. She was acutely aware\nthat this was the first time since they had entered the ship that she\nand Burke could speak to each other when nobody could overhear. They'd\nspoken twice when the others were presumably asleep. But this was the\nfirst time they'd been alone.\n\nWhen they'd passed through the door with the rounded corners, they were\ncompletely isolated. Overhead, brilliant light-tubes reached a full\nmile down the gallery in one direction, and half as far in the other.\nThe vast corridor contained nothing to make a sound but themselves.\n\n\"It's this way,\" said Burke.\n\nSandy knew the way as well as he did, or better, but she accepted his\ndirection. Their footsteps echoed and re\u00ebchoed, so that they were\naccompanied by countless reflections of heel-clicks along with the\nnormal rustling and whispering sounds of walking.\n\nThey went a full quarter-mile from the ship-lock door, and came to a\nvery large arched opening which gave entrance to a corridor slanting\ndownward.\n\n\"Supplies came up this ramp,\" said Sandy.\n\nIt was a statement which should have been startling, but Burke nodded.\n\nSandy went on, carefully, \"That cube about a supply-officer's duties\nwas pretty explicit. Things were getting difficult.\"\n\nBurke did not seem to hear. They went on and on. They came to the place\nwhere Keller had turned aside. Burke silently indicated the turning.\nThey moved along this other gallery.\n\n\"Joe,\" said Sandy pleadingly. \"Is it really so bad?\"\n\n\"Strictly speaking, I don't see a chance. But that's just the way it\nlooks now. There must be something that can be done. The trick is to\nfind it. Meantime, why panic?\"\n\n\"You--act queer,\" protested Sandy.\n\n\"I feel queer,\" he said. \"I know various ways to approach problems.\nNone of them apply to this one. You see, it isn't really our problem.\nWe're innocent bystanders, without information about the situation\nthat apparently will kill us and everybody back on Earth. If we knew\nmore about the situation, we might find some part of it that could\nbe tackled, changed. There may be something in this case--perhaps a\nmessage left by the garrison for the people who sent them here. I can't\nsee why it'd be placed here, though.\"\n\nHe slowed, looking down one cross-gallery after another.\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\nThey'd come to the clumsily-made case with the inscription on it.\nIt was placed against the wall of a corridor, facing the length of\nanother gallery which came from the side at this point. A little\ndistance down the other passage, the line of doors was broken by an\narchway which gave upon a hewed-out compartment. The opening was wide\nenough to show a fragment of a metal floor. There was no sign of any\ncontents. Other compartments nearby were empty. The placing of the\ninscribed box was inexplicable. But the inscription was sharply clear.\n\n\"Maybe,\" suggested Sandy forlornly, \"it says something like\n'Explosives! Danger!'\"\n\n\"Not likely,\" said Burke.\n\nHe'd examined the box before. He'd brought along a tool suited to the\njob of opening it. He set to work, then stopped.\n\n\"Sandy,\" he said abruptly, \"I think the gravity-generator's a couple\nof corridors in that direction. Will you look and see if there are any\ntools there that might be better than this? Just look for a place where\ntools might be stored. If you find something, call me.\"\n\nShe went obediently down the lighted, excavated corridor. She reached\nthe vast cavern. Here there were myriad tube-lights glowing in the\nceiling--and the gravity machine. It was gigantic. It was six storeys\nhigh and completely mysterious.\n\nShe looked with careful intentness for a place where tools might have\nbeen kept by the machine's attendants.\n\nShe saw movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she turned\nthere was nothing. There could be no movement in the fortress unless\nby machinery or one of the five humans who'd come so recently. The\nasteroid had been airless for ten thousand years. It was unthinkable\nthat anything alive, even a microbe, could have survived. So Sandy did\nnot think of a living thing as having made the movement. But movement\nthere had been.\n\nShe stared. There were totally motionless machines all about. None\nof them showed any sign of stirring. Sandy swallowed the ache in her\nthroat and it returned instantly. She moved, to look where the movement\nhad been. She glanced at each machine in turn. One might have made some\nautomatic adjustment. She'd tell Burke.\n\nShe passed a fifteen-foot-high assembly of insulators and bright metal,\nconnected overhead to other cryptic things by heavy silvery bars. She\npassed a cylinder with dials in its sides.\n\nShe saw movement again. In a different place. She spun around to look.\n\nSomething half the height of a man, with bird-legs and feet and\nswollen plumage and a head with an oversized beak which was pure\ncaricature--something alive and frightened fled from her. It waddled in\nridiculous, panicky haste. It flapped useless stumps of wings. It fled\nin terrified silence. It vanished.\n\nThe first thing that occurred to Sandy was that Burke wouldn't believe\nher if she told him.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\nBurke found her, rooted to the spot. He had a small metal box in his\nhand. He didn't notice her pallor nor that she trembled.\n\n\"I may have something,\" he said with careful calm. \"The case had this\nin it. There's a black cube in the box. The case seems to have been\nmade to hold and call attention to this cube. I'll take it up to the\ninstrument-room and use a reader on it.\"\n\nHe led the way. Sandy followed, her throat dry. She knew, of course,\nthat he was under almost intolerable emotional strain. He'd brought her\nalong to be with her for a few moments, but he was so tense that he\ncould think of nothing personal to say. Now it was not possible for him\nto talk of anything at all.\n\nYet Sandy realized that even under the stress that pressed upon him,\nhe'd asked her to go look for tools in the gravity-machine room because\nshe'd spoken of possible danger in the opening of the case. He'd gotten\nher away while he opened it.\n\nWhen they reached the ship-lock he said briefly, \"I want to hurry,\nSandy. Wait for me in the ship?\"\n\nShe nodded, and went to the small spacecraft which had brought them all\nfrom Earth.\n\nWhen she saw Pam, inside, she said shakily, \"Is--anybody else here?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pam. \"Why?\"\n\nSandy sat down and shivered.\n\n\"I think,\" she said through chattering teeth, \"I think I'm going to\nhave hysterics. L-listen, Pam! I--I saw something alive! It was like a\nbird this high and big as a--There aren't any birds like that! There\ncan't be anything alive here but us! But I saw it! And it saw me and\nran away!\"\n\nPam stared and asked questions, at first soothing ones. But presently\nshe was saying indignantly, \"I do believe it! That's near the place\nwhere I smelled fresh air!\"\n\nOf course, fresh air in the asteroid, two hundred and seventy million\nmiles from Earth, was as impossible as what Sandy had seen.\n\nHolmes came in presently, depressed and tired. He'd been filling his\nmind with the contents of black cubes. He knew how cooking was done in\nthe kitchens of the fortress, some eons since. He knew how to prepare\nfor inspection of the asteroid by a high-ranking officer. He was fully\nconversant with the bugle-calls once used in the fortress in the place\nof a public-address loud-speaker system. But he'd found no hint of how\nthe fortress received its supplies, nor how the air was freshened,\nnor how reinforcements of men used to reach the asteroid. He was\ndiscouraged and vexed and weary.\n\n\"Sandy,\" said Pam challengingly, \"saw a live bird, bigger than a goose,\nin the gravity-machine room.\"\n\nHolmes shrugged.\n\n\"Keller's fidgeting,\" he observed, \"because he thinks he's seen\nmovements in the vision-plates that show different inside views of this\nthing. But he isn't sure that he's seen anything move. Maybe we're all\ngoing out of our minds.\"\n\n\"Then Joe's closest,\" said Pam darkly. \"He worries about Sandy!\"\n\n\"And very reasonably,\" said Holmes tiredly. \"Pam, this business of\nfiguring that there's something deadly on the way and nothing to do\nabout it--it's got me down!\"\n\nHe slumped in a chair. Pam frowned at him. Sandy sat perfectly still,\nher hands clenched.\n\nBurke came back twenty minutes later. His expression was studiedly calm.\n\n\"I've found out where the garrison went,\" he said matter-of-factly.\n\"I'm afraid we can't get any help from them. Or anybody else.\"\n\nSandy looked at him mutely. He was completely self-controlled, and he\ndid not look like a man resolutely refusing to despair, but Sandy knew\nhim. To her it seemed that his eyes had sunk a little in his head.\n\n\"Apparently there's nobody left on the world the garrison came from,\"\nsaid Burke in the tone of someone saying perfectly commonplace things,\n\"so they didn't go back there and there's no use in our trying to make\na contact with that world. This was an outpost fortress, you know. It\nwas reached from somewhere far away, and carved out and armed to fight\nan enemy that didn't attack it for itself, but to get at the world or\nworlds that made it.\"\n\nHe continued with immoderate calm, \"I believe the home world of that\ncivilization has two moons in its sky and something off at the horizon\nthat looks like a hill, but isn't.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"The garrison left,\" explained Burke, \"because it was abandoned. It was\nleft behind to stand off the Enemy, and the civilization it belonged to\nmoved away. It was left without supplies, without equipment, without\nhope. It was left behind even without training to face abandonment,\nbecause its members had been trained by black cubes and only knew how\nto do their own highly special jobs by rote. They were just ordinary\nsoldiers, like the Roman detachments left behind when the legions\nmarched south from Hadrian's Wall and sailed for Gaul. So when there\nwas nothing left for them to do but leave their post or starve--because\nthey couldn't follow the civilization that had abandoned them--they\nleft. The cube in the box was a message they set up for their former\nrulers and fellow-citizens if they ever returned. It's not a pretty\nmessage!\"\n\nSandy swallowed.\n\n\"Where'd they go? What happened to them?\"\n\n\"They went to Earth,\" said Burke tonelessly. \"By twos and fives and\ndozens, in the service ships that came out with meat, and took back\npassengers. The service ships had been assigned to bring out what meat\nthe hunting-parties could kill. They took back men who were fighters\nand ready to face mammoths or sabre tooth tigers or anything else.\nJust the same, they left a transmitter to call them back if the Enemy\never came again. But it didn't come in their lifetimes, and their\ndescendants forgot. But the transmitter remembered. It called to them.\nAnd--we were the ones to answer!\"\n\nSandy hesitated a moment.\n\n\"But if the garrison went to Earth,\" she said dubiously, \"what became\nof them? There aren't any traces--\"\n\n\"We're traces,\" said Burke. \"They were our ancestors of ten or twenty\nthousand years ago. They couldn't build a civilization. They were\nfighting men! Could the Romans left behind at Hadrian's Wall keep up\nthe culture of Rome? Of course not! The garrison went to Earth and\nturned savage, and their children's children's children built up a new\ncivilization. And for here and for now, we're it. We've got to face the\nEnemy and drive him back.\"\n\nHe stopped, and said in a tone that was almost completely steady and\nheld no hint of despair, \"It's going to be quite a job. But it's an\nemergency. We've got to manage it somehow.\"\n\nThere was also an emergency on Earth, not simplified as in space\nby having somebody like Burke accept the burden of meeting it. The\nemergency stemmed from the fact that despite the best efforts of the\nair arm of the United States, Burke and the others had gotten out to\nspace. They'd reached the asteroid M-387. Naturally. The United States\nthereupon took credit for this most creditable achievement. Inevitably.\nAnd it was instantly and frantically denounced for suspected\nspace-imperialism, space-monopoly, and intended space-exploitation.\n\nBut when Keller's painstaking instructions for the building of\ngravity-field detectors reached Earth, these suspicions seemed less\nplausible. The United States passed on the instructions. The basic\nprinciple was so new that nobody could claim it, but it was so simple\nthat many men felt a wholesome shame that they had not thought of it\nbefore. Nobody could question a natural law which was so obvious once\nit was stated. And the building of the device required next to no time\nat all.\n\nWithin days then, where the asteroid had a single ten-foot instrument,\nthe United States had a ten-foot, a thirty-foot and a sixty-foot\ngravity-field detector available to qualified researchers. The new\ninstruments gave data such as no astronomer had ever hoped for\nbefore. The thirty-foot disk, tuned for short range, pictured every\ngravitational field in the solar system. A previously unguessed-at\nSaturnian moon, hidden in the outer ring, turned up. All the asteroids\ncould be located at one instant. The mystery of the inadequate mass of\nPluto was solved within hours of turning on the thirty-foot device.\n\nWhen the sixty-foot instrument went on, scaled to take in half a\nhundred light-years of space, the solar system was a dot on it. But\nfour dark stars, one with planets, and twenty-odd planetary systems\nwere mapped within a day. On that same day, though, a query went back\nto Keller. What, said the query, was the meaning of certain crawling,\nbright-red specks in mathematically exact relationship to each other,\nwhich were visibly in motion and much closer to Earth than Alpha\nCentaurus? Alpha Centaurus had always been considered the closest of\nall stars to Earth. Under magnification the bright-red sparks wove and\ninterwove their paths as if about a common center of gravity. If such a\nthing were not impossible, it would be guessed that they were suns so\nclose together as to revolve about one another within hours. Even more\npreposterously, they moved through space at a rate which was a multiple\nof the speed of light. Thirty light-speeds, of course, could not be.\nAnd the direction of their motion seemed to be directly toward the\nglowings which represented the solar system containing Earth. All this\nwas plainly absurd. But what was the cause of this erroneous report\nfrom the new device?\n\nKeller wrote out very neatly, \"_The instrument here shows the same\nphenomenon. Its appearance much farther away triggered the transmitter\nhere to send the first signals to Earth. Data suggests red dots\nrepresent artificial gravity-fields strong enough to warp space and\nproduce new spatial constants including higher speed for light, hence\npossible higher speed for spacecraft carrying artificial gravity\ngenerators. Request evaluation this possibility._\"\n\nPam coded it and sent it to Earth. And presently, on Earth, astronomers\nlooked at each other helplessly. Because Keller had stated the only\npossible explanation. Objects like real suns, if so close together,\nwould tear each other to bits and fuse in flaming novas. Moreover,\nthe pattern of motion of the red-spark-producing objects could not\nhave come into being of itself. It was artificial. There was a group\nof Things in motion toward Earth's solar system. They would arrive\nwithin so many days. They were millions of miles apart, but their\ngravity-fields were so strong that they orbited each other within\nhours. If they had gravity-fields, they had mass, which could be as\nartificial as their gravity. And, whirling about each other in the\nmaddest of dances, ten suns passing through the human solar system\ncould leave nothing but debris behind them.\n\nOddly enough, the ships that made those gravity-fields might be so\nsmall as to be beyond the power of a telescope to detect at a few\nthousand miles. The destruction of all the solar planets and the sun\nitself might be accomplished by motes. They would not need to use power\nfor destruction. Gravitation is not expended any more than magnetism,\nwhen something is attracted by it. The artificial gravity-fields would\nonly need to be built up. They had been. Once created, they could exist\nforever without need for added power, just as the sun and planets do\nnot expend power for their mutual attraction, and as the Earth parts\nwith no energy to keep its moon a captive.\n\nThe newspapers did not publish this news. But, very quietly, every\ncivilized government on Earth got instructions for the making of a\ngravity-field detector. Most had them built. And then for the first\ntime in human history there was an actual and desperately honest\nattempt to poll all human knowledge and all human resources for a\ncommon human end. For once, no eminent figure assumed the undignified\npose involved in standing on one's dignity. For once, the public\nremained unworried and undisturbed while the heads of states aged\nvisibly.\n\nNaturally some of the people in the secret frantically demanded that\nthe five in the fortress solve the problem all the science of Earth\ncould not even attack. Incredible lists of required information items\nwent out to Burke and Keller and Holmes. Keller read the lists calmly\nand tried to answer the questions that seemed to make sense. Holmes\ndoggedly spent all his time experiencing cubes in the hope that by\nsheer accident he might come upon something useful. Pam, scowling,\ncoded and decoded without pause. And Sandy looked anxiously at Burke.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you to do something for me,\" she said. \"When we went\ndown to the Lower Levels, I thought I saw something moving. Something\nalive.\"\n\n\"Nerves,\" said Burke. \"There couldn't be anything alive in this place.\nNot after so many years without air.\"\n\n\"I know,\" acknowledged Sandy. \"I know it's ridiculous. But Pam's felt\ncreepy, too, as if there were something deadly somewhere in the rooms\nwe've never been in.\"\n\nBurke moved his head impatiently. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Holmes found some hand-weapons,\" said Sandy. \"They don't work, of\ncourse. Will you fix one for Pam and one for me so that they do?\" She\npaused and added, \"Of course it doesn't matter whether we're frightened\nor not, considering. It doesn't even matter whether there is something\nalive. It doesn't matter if we're killed. But it would be pleasant not\nto feel defenseless.\"\n\nBurke shrugged. \"I'll fix them.\"\n\nShe put three of the transparent-barreled weapons before him and said,\n\"I'm going up to the instrument-room and help Pam with her coding.\"\n\nShe went out. Burke took the three hand-weapons and looked at them\nwithout interest. But in a technician of any sort there is always some\nresponse to a technical problem. A trivial thing like a hand-weapon\nout of order could hold Burke's attention simply because it did not\nrefer to the coming disaster.\n\nHe loosened the hand-grip plates and looked at the completely simple\ndevices inside the weapons. There was a tiny battery, of course. In\nthousands of years its electrolyte had evaporated. Burke replaced\nit from the water stores of the ship. He did the same to the other\ntwo weapons. Then, curious, he stepped out of the ship's air-lock\nand aimed at the ship-lock wall. He pressed the trigger. There was a\nsnapping sound and a fragment of rock fell. He tried the others. They\nfired something. It was not a bullet. The barrels of the weapons, on\ninspection, were not hollow. They were solid. The weapons fired a\nthrust, a push, an immaterial blow which was concentrated on a tiny\nspot. They punched, with nothing solid to do the punching.\n\n\"Probably punch a hole right through a man,\" said Burke, reflectively.\n\nHe took the three weapons and went toward the instrument-room. On the\nway, his mind went automatically back to the coming destruction. It was\ncompletely arbitrary. The Enemy had no reason to destroy the human race\nin this solar system. Men, here, had lost all recollection of their\norigin and assuredly all memory of enmities known before memory began.\nIf any tradition remained of the fortress, even, it would be hidden in\ntales of a Golden Age before Pandora was, or of an Age of Innocence\nwhen all things came without effort. Those stories were changed out of\nall semblance to their foundations, of course, as ever-more-ignorant\nand ever-more-unsophisticated generations retold them. Perhaps the\nGolden Age was a garbled memory of a time when machines performed tasks\nfor men--before the machines wore out and could not be replaced without\nother machines to make them. Perhaps the slow development of tools,\nwith which men did things that machines formerly did for them, blurred\nthe accounts of times when men did not need to use tools. Even the\neverywhere-present traditions of a long, long journey in a boat--the\nflood legends--might be the last trace of grand-sires' yarns about a\njourney to Earth. It would have been modified by successive generations\nwho could not imagine a journey through emptiness, and therefore\ndevised a flood as a more scientific and reasonable explanation for\nmyths plainly overlaid with fantasy and superstition.\n\nBurke went into the instrument-room as Sandy was asking, \"But how did\nthey? We haven't found any ship-lock except the one we came in by! And\nif a ship can't travel faster than light without wrapping artificial\nmass about itself ...\"\n\nHolmes had taken off his helmet He said doggedly, \"There's nothing\nabout ships in the cubes. Anyhow, the nearest other sun is four\nlight-years away. Nobody'd try to carry all the food a whole colony\nwould need from as far away as that! If they'd used ships for supply,\nthere'd have been hydroponic gardens all over the place to ease the\nload the ships had to carry! There was some other way to get stuff\nhere!\"\n\n\"Whatever it was, it didn't bring meat from Earth. That was hauled out,\nfastened to the outside of service-boats.\"\n\n\"Another thing,\" Holmes said. \"There were thousands of people in the\ngarrison, here. How did the air get renewed? Nobody's found any mention\nof air-purifying apparatus in the cubes. There's been no sign of any!\nAn emergency air-supply, yes. It was let loose when we came into the\nship-lock. But there's no regular provision for purifying the air and\nputting oxygen into it and breaking down the CO_{2}!\"\n\n\"Won't anyone believe I smelled fresh air yesterday?\" Pam asked\nplaintively.\n\nNo one commented. It could not be believed. Burke handed Sandy one of\nthe weapons. He gave Pam a second.\n\n\"They work very much like the ship-drive, which was developed from\nthem. A battery in the handle energizes them so they use the heat they\ncontain to make a lethal punch without a kick-back. They'll get pretty\ncold after a dozen or so shots.\"\n\nHe sat down and Holmes went on almost angrily, \"The garrison had to get\nfood here. It didn't come in ships. They had to purify the air. They've\nnothing to do it with! How did they manage?\"\n\nKeller smiled faintly. He pointed to a control on the wall.\n\n\"If that worked, we could ask. It is supposed to be communication with\nbase. It is turned on. Nothing happens.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I'm thinking?\" demanded Holmes. \"I'm thinking of a\nmatter-transmitter! It's been pointed out before that we'll never reach\nthe stars in spaceships limited to one light-speed. What good would be\nvoyages that lasted ten, twenty, or fifty years each way? But if there\ncould be matter-transmitters--\"\n\nKeller said gently, \"Transmitters, no. Transposers, yes.\"\n\nIt was a familiar enough distinction. To break down an object into\nelectric charges and reconstitute it at some distant place would be a\nself-defeating operation. It could have no actual value. To transmit\na hundred and fifty pounds of electric energy--the weight of a man\nconverted into current--would require the mightiest of bus-bars for a\nconductor, and months of time if it was not to burn out from overload.\nThe actual transmission of mass as electric energy would be absurd.\nBut if an object could simply be transposed from one place to another;\nif it could be translated from place to place; if it could undergo\nsubstitution of surroundings.... That would be a different matter!\nTransposition would be instantaneous. Translation would require no\ntime. Substitution of position--a man who was here this instant would\nbe there the next--would have no temporal aspect. Such a development\nwould make anything possible. A ship might undertake a voyage to\nlast a century. If a matter-transposer were a part of it, it could\nbe supplied with fuel and air and foodstuffs on its voyage. Its crew\ncould be relieved and exchanged whenever it was desired. And when it\nmade a planet-fall a hundred years and more from home, why, home would\nstill be just around the transposer. With matter-transposition an\ninterstellar civilization could arise and thrive, even though limited\nto the speed of light for its ships. But a culture spread over hundreds\nof light-years would be unthinkable without something permitting\ninstant communication between its parts.\n\n\"All right!\" said Holmes doggedly. \"Call them transposers! This\nfortress had to be supplied. We've found no sign that ships were used\nto supply it. It needed to have its air renewed and refreshed. We've\nfound no sign of anything but emergency stores of air in case some\nunknown air-supply system failed. What's the matter with looking for a\nmatter-transposer?\"\n\nBurke said, \"In a way, a telephone system transposes sound-waves from\none place to another. Sound-waves aren't carried along wires. They're\nhere, and then suddenly they're there. But there has to be a sending\nand receiving station at each end. When the fortress here was 'cut off'\nfrom home it could be that its supply-system broke down.\"\n\n\"Its air-system didn't,\" said Holmes. \"It hadn't used up its emergency\nair-supply. We're breathing it!\"\n\n\"Anyhow we could try to find even a broken-down transposer,\" said Sandy.\n\n\"You try,\" said Burke. \"Keller's been looking for something for me in\nthe cubes. I'll stay here and help him look.\"\n\nSandy examined the weapon he'd given her.\n\n\"Pam says she's smelled fresh air, down below where there can't be\nany. Mr. Keller thought he saw movements in the inside vision-plates,\nwhere there can't be any. I still believe I saw something alive in the\ngravity-machine room, where such a thing is impossible. We're going to\nlook, Pam and I.\"\n\nHolmes lumbered to his feet.\n\n\"I'll come, too. And I'll guarantee to defend you against anything that\nhas survived the ten thousand years or so that this place was without\nair. My head's tired, after all those cubes.\"\n\nHe led the way. Burke watched as the two girls followed him and closed\nthe door behind them.\n\n\"What have you found, Keller?\"\n\n\"A cube about globes,\" said Keller. \"Very interesting.\"\n\n\"Nothing on communication with base?\"\n\nKeller shook his head.\n\nBurke said evenly, \"I figured out three chances for us--all slim ones.\nThe first was to find the garrison when the radio summons didn't and\nget it or its descendants to help. I found the garrison--on Earth. No\nhelp there. The second chance was finding the civilization that had\nbuilt this fortress. It looks like it's collapsed. There's been time\nfor a new civilization to get started, but it's run away. The third\nchance is the slimmest of all. It's hooking together something to fight\nwith.\"\n\nKeller reached out over the array of cubes that had been experienced by\nHolmes and himself while using the helmets from the cube-library. One\ncube had been set aside. Keller put it in place on the extra helmet and\nhanded it to Burke.\n\n\"Try it,\" said Keller.\n\nBurke put the helmet on his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_He was in this same instrument-room, but he wore a uniform and he sat\nat an instrument-board. He knew that there were drone service-boats\nperhaps ten thousand miles out, perhaps a hundred. They'd been fitted\nout to make a mock attack on the fortress. Counter-tactics men devised\nthem. There was reason for worry. Three times, now, drones pretending\nto be Enemy ships had dodged past the screen of globes set out to\nprevent just such an evasion. Once, one of the drones had gloatingly\ntouched the stone of the fortress' outer surface. This was triumph for\nthe counter-tactics crew, but it was proof that an Enemy ship could\nhave wiped out the fortress and all its garrison a hundred times over._\n\n_Burke sweated. There was a speck with a yellow ring about it. It was\na globe, poised and ready to dart in any conceivable direction if an\nEnemy detection-device ranged it. The globes did not go seeking an\nEnemy. They placed themselves where they would be sought. They set\nthemselves up as targets. But when a radar-pulse touched them, they\nflung themselves at its source, their reflex chooser-circuits pouring\nincredible power into a beam of the same characteristics as the\nradar-touch. That beam, of course, paralyzed or burned out the Enemy\ndevice necessarily tuned to it. And the globes plunged at the thing\nwhich had found them. They accelerated at a hundred and sixty gravities\nand mere high explosive would be wasted if they carried it. Nothing\ncould stand their impact. Nothing!_\n\n_But in drills three drones had dodged them. The counter-tactics men\nunderstood the drones, of course, as it was hoped the Enemy did not.\nBut it should not be possible to get to the fortress! If the fortress\nwas vulnerable, so was the Empire. If the Empire was vulnerable,\nthe Enemy would wreck its worlds, blast its cities, exterminate its\npopulation and only foulness would remain in the Galaxy._\n\n_On the monitor-board a light flashed. A line of green light darted\nacross the screen. It was the path of a globe hurtling toward something\nthat had touched it with a radar-frequency signal. The acceleration of\nthe globe was breathtaking. It seemed to explode toward its target._\n\n_But this globe hit nothing. It went on and on.... A second globe\nsprang. It also struck nothing. It went away to illimitable emptiness.\nIts path exactly crossed that of the first. A third and fourth and\nfifth.... Each one flung itself ferociously at the source of some\ntrickle of radiation. Their trails crossed at exactly the same spot.\nBut there was nothing there...._\n\n_Burke suddenly flung up a row of switches, inactivating the remaining\nglobes under his control. Five had flung themselves away, darting\nat something which radiated but did not exist. Something which was\nnot solid. Which was not a drone ship impersonating an Enemy. They'd\nattacked an illusion...._\n\n_At the control-board. Burke clenched his fist and struck angrily at\nthe flat surface before him. An illusion! Of course!_\n\n_Cunningly, he made adjustments. He had five globes left. He chose one\nand changed the setting of its reflex chooser-circuit. It would ignore\nradar frequencies now. It would pick up only stray radiation--induction\nfrequencies from a drone ship with its drive on._\n\n_The globe's light flashed. A train of green fire appeared. A burst of\nflame. A hit! The drone was destroyed. He swiftly changed the setting\nof the reflex circuits of the rest. Two! Three! Three drones blasted in\ntwice as many seconds._\n\n_He mopped his forehead. This was only a drill, but when the Enemy came\nit would be the solution of such problems that would determine the\nsurvival of the fortress and the destruction of the Enemy._\n\n_He reported his success crisply._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBurke took off the helmet.\n\nKeller said mildly, \"What did he do?\"\n\nBurke considered.\n\n\"The drone, faking to be an enemy, had dumped something out into space.\nMetal powder, perhaps. It made a cloud in emptiness. Then the drone\ndrew off and threw a radar-beam on the cloud of metal particles. The\nbeam bounced in all directions. When a globe picked it up, it shot\nfor the phony metal-powder target. It went right through and off into\nspace. Other globes fell for the same trick. When they were all gone,\nthe drones could have come right up to the fort.\"\n\nHe was almost interested. He'd felt, at least, the sweating earnestness\nof an unknown member of this garrison, dead some thousands of years, as\nhe tried to make a good showing in a battle drill.\n\n\"So he changed the reflex circuits,\" Burke added. \"He stopped his\nglobes from homing on radar frequencies. He made them home on\nfrequencies that wouldn't bounce.\" Then he said in surprise, \"But they\ndidn't hit, at that! The drones blew up before the globes got to them!\nThey were exploding from the burning-out of all their equipment before\nthe globes got there!\"\n\nKeller nodded. He said sorrowfully, \"So clever, our ancestors. But not\nclever enough!\"\n\n\"Of our chances,\" said Burke, \"or what I think are chances, the least\npromising seems to be the idea of trying to hook something together\nto fight with.\" He considered, and then smiled very faintly. \"You saw\nmovements you couldn't identify in the vision-plates? Sandy says she\nsaw something alive. I wonder if something besides us answered the\nspace-call and got into the fortress by a different way, and has been\nhiding out, afraid of us.\"\n\nKeller shook his head.\n\n\"I don't believe it either,\" admitted Burke. \"It seems crazy. But it\nmight be true. It might. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel for\nsolutions to our problem.\"\n\nKeller shook his head again. Burke shrugged and went out of the\ninstrument-room. He went down the stairs and the first long corridor,\nand past the long rows of emplacements in which were set the hunkering\nmetal monsters he'd cube-dreamed of using, but which would be of no\nconceivable use against speeding, whirling, artificial-gravity fields\nwith the pull and the mass of suns.\n\nHe reached the last long gallery on which the ship-lock opened. He\nsaw the broad white ribbon of many strands of light, reaching away\nseemingly without limit. And he saw a tiny figure running toward him.\nIt was Sandy. She staggered as she ran. She had already run past\nendurance, but she kept desperately on. Burke broke into a run himself.\n\nWhen he met her, she gasped, \"Pam! She--vanished--down below! We\nwere--looking, and Pam cried out. We ran to her. Gone! And we--heard\nnoises! Noises! Holmes is searching now. She--screamed, Joe!\"\n\nBurke swung her behind him.\n\n\"Tell Keller,\" he commanded harshly. \"You've got that hand-weapon? Hold\non to it! Bring Keller! We'll all search! Hurry!\"\n\nHe broke into a dead run.\n\nIt might have seemed ironic that he should rush to help Sandy's sister\nin whatever disaster had befallen her when they were facing the end of\nthe whole solar system. In cold blood, it couldn't be considered to\nmatter. But Burke ran.\n\nHe panted when he plunged down the ramp to the lower portions of\nthe asteroid. He reached the huge cavern in which the motionless\npower-generator towered storeys high toward a light-laced ceiling.\n\n\"Holmes!\" he shouted, and ran on. \"Holmes!\"\n\nHe'd been no farther than this, before, but he went on into tunnels\nwith only double lines of light-tubes overhead, and he shouted and\nheard his own voice reverberating in a manner which seemed pure\nmockery. But as he ran he continued to shout.\n\nAnd presently Holmes shouted in return. There was a process of\nuntangling innumerable echoes, and ultimately they met. Holmes was\ndeathly white. He carried something unbelievable in his hands.\n\n\"Here!\" he growled. \"I found this. I cornered it. I killed it! What is\nit? Did things like this catch Pam?\"\n\nOnly a man beside himself could have asked such a question. Holmes\ncarried the corpse of a bird with mottled curly feathers. He'd wrung\nits neck. He suddenly flung it aside.\n\n\"Where's Pam?\" he demanded fiercely. \"What the hell's happened to her?\nI'll kill anything in creation that's tried to hurt her!\"\n\nBurke snapped questions. Inane ones. Where had Pam been last? Where\nwere Holmes and Sandy when they missed her? When she cried out?\n\nHolmes tried to show him. But this part of the asteroid was a maze\nof corridors with uncountable doorways opening into innumerable\ncompartments. Some of these compartments were not wholly empty, but\nneither Burke nor Holmes bothered to examine machine-parts or stacks of\ncases that would crumble to dust at a touch. They searched like crazy\nmen, calling to Pam.\n\nKeller and Sandy arrived. They'd passed the corpse of the bird Holmes\nhad killed, and Keller was strangely white-faced. Sandy panted, \"Did\nyou find her? Have you found any sign?\"\n\nBut she knew the answer. They hadn't found Pam. Holmes was haggard,\ndesperate, filled with a murderous fury against whatever unnameable\nthing had taken Pam away.\n\n\"Here!\" snapped Burke. \"Let's get some system into this! Here's the\ncase with the message-cube. It's our marker. We start from here! I'll\nfollow this cross corridor and the next one. You three take the next\nthree corridors going parallel. One each! Look in every doorway. When\nwe reach the next cross-corridor we'll compare notes and make another\nmarker.\"\n\nHe went along the way he'd chosen, looking in every door. Cryptic\nmasses of metal in one compartment. A heap of dust in another. Empty.\nEmpty. A pile of metal furniture. Another empty. Still another.\n\nHolmes appeared, his hands clenching and unclenching. Sandy turned up,\nstruggling for self-control.\n\n\"Where's Keller?\"\n\n\"I heard him call out,\" said Sandy breathlessly. \"I thought he'd found\nsomething and I hurried--\"\n\nHe did not come. They shouted. They searched. Keller had disappeared.\nThey found the mark they'd started from and retraced their steps. Burke\nheard Holmes swear startledly, but there were so many echoes he could\nnot catch words.\n\nSandy met Burke. Holmes did not. He did not answer shouts. He was gone.\n\n\"We stay together,\" said Burke in an icy voice. \"We've both got\nhand-weapons. Keep yours ready to fire. I've got mine. Whatever out\nof hell is loose in this place, we'll kill it or it will kill us, and\nthen--\"\n\nHe did not finish. They stayed close together, with Burke in the lead.\n\n\"We'll look in each doorway,\" he insisted. \"Keep that pistol ready.\nDon't shoot the others if you see them, but shoot anything else!\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said Sandy. She swallowed.\n\nIt was nerve-racking. Burke regarded each doorway as a possible ambush.\nHe investigated each one first, making sure that the compartment\ninside it was wholly empty. There was one extra-large archway to an\nextra-large compartment, halfway between their starting point and the\nnext cross-corridor. It was obviously empty, though there was a large\nmetal plate on the floor. But it was lighted. Nothing could lurk in\nthere.\n\nBurke inspected the compartment beyond, and the one beyond that.\n\nHe thought he heard Sandy gasp. He whirled, gun ready.\n\nSandy was gone.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\nThe star Sol was as bright as Sirius, but no brighter because it was\nnearly half a light-year away and of course could not compare in\nintrinsic brightness with that farther giant sun. The Milky Way glowed\ncoldly. All the stars shone without any wavering in their light, from\nthe brightest to the faintest tinted dot. The universe was round. There\nwere stars above and below and before and behind and to the right and\nleft. There was nothing which was solid, and nothing which was opaque.\nThere were only infinitely remote, unwinking motes of light, but there\nwere thousands of millions of them. Everywhere there were infinitesimal\nshinings of red and blue and yellow and green; of all the colors that\ncould be imagined. Yet all the starlight from all the cosmos added\nup to no more than darkness. The whitest of objects would not shine\nexcept faintly, dimly, feebly. There was no warmth. This was deep\nspace, frigid beyond imagining; desolate beyond thinking; empty. It was\nnothingness spread out in the light of many stars.\n\nIn such cold and darkness it would seem that nothing could be, and\nthere was nothing to be seen. But now and again a pattern of stars\nquivered a little. It contracted a trace and then returned to its\noriginal appearance. The disturbance of the star-patterns moved, as a\ndisturbance, in vast curved courses. They were like isolated ripplings\nin space.\n\nThere seemed no cause for these ripplings. But there were powerful\ngravitational fields in the void, so powerful as to warp space and bend\nthe starlight passing through them. These gravity-fields moved with an\nincredible speed. There were ten of them, circling in a complex pattern\nwhich was spread out as an invisible unit which moved faster than the\nlight their space-twisting violence distorted.\n\nThey seemed absolutely undetectable, because even such minute\nlight-ripplings as they made were left behind them. The ten ships which\ncreated these monstrous force-fields were unbelievably small. They were\nno larger than cargo ships on the oceans of one planet in the solar\nsystem toward which they sped. They were less than dust particles in\ninfinity. They would travel for only a few more days, now, and then\nwould flash through the solar system which was their target. They\nshould reach its outermost planet--four light-hours away--and within\neight minutes more swing mockingly past and through the inner worlds\nand the sun. They would cross the plane of the ecliptic at nearly a\nright angle, and they should leave the planets and the yellow star Sol\nin flaming self-destruction behind them. Then they would flee onward,\nfaster than the chaos they created could follow.\n\nThe living creatures on the world to be destroyed would have no\nwarning. One instant everything would be as it had always been. The\nnext, the ground would rise and froth out flames, and more than two\nthousand million human beings would hardly know that anything had\noccurred before they were destroyed.\n\nThere was no purpose to be served by notifying the world that it was\nto die. The rulers of the nations had decided that it was kinder to\nlet men and women look at each other and rejoice, thinking they had\nall their lives before them. It was kinder that children should be let\nplay valorously, and babies wail and instantly be tended. It was better\nfor humanity to move unknowing under blue and sunshine-filled skies\nthan that they should gaze despairingly up at white clouds, or in still\ndeeper horror at the shining night stars from which devastation would\npresently come.\n\nIn the one place where there was foreknowledge, no attention at all\nwas paid to the coming doom. Burke went raging about brightly lighted\ncorridors, shouting horrible things. He cried out to Sandy to answer\nhim, and defied whatever might have seized her to dare to face him. He\nchallenged the cold stone walls. He raged up and down the gallery in\nwhich she had vanished, and feverishly explored beyond it, and returned\nto the place where she had disappeared, and pounded on solid rock to\nsee if there could be some secret doorway through which she had been\nabducted. It seemed that his heart must stop for pure anguish. He knew\nsuch an agony of frustration as he had never known before.\n\nPresently method developed in his searching. Whatever had happened, it\nmust have been close to the tall archway with the large metal plate in\nits floor and the brilliant lights overhead. Sandy could not have been\nmore than twenty feet from him when she was seized. When he heard her\ngasp, he was at this spot. Exactly this spot. He'd whirled, and she was\ngone. She could not have been farther than the door beyond the archway,\nor else the one facing it. He went into the most probable one. It was a\nperfectly commonplace storage-room. He'd seen hundreds of them. It was\nempty. He examined it with a desperate intentness. His hands shook. His\nwhole body was taut. He moved jerkily.\n\nNothing. He crossed the corridor and examined the room opposite. There\nwas a bit of dust in one corner. He bent stiffly and fingered it.\nNothing. He came out, and there was the tall archway, brightly lighted.\nThe other compartments had no light-tubes. Being for storage only,\nthey would not need to be lighted except to be filled and emptied of\nwhatever they should contain. But the archway was very brilliantly\nlighted.\n\nHe went into it, his hand-weapon shaking with the tension in him. There\nwas the metal plate on the floor. It was large--yards in extent. He\nbegan a circuit of the walls. Halfway around, he realized that the\nwalls were masonry. Not native rock, like every other place in the\nfortress. This wall had been made! He stared about. On the opposite\nwall there was a small thing with a handle on it, to be moved up or\ndown. It was a round metal disk with a handle, set in the masonry.\n\nHe flung himself across the room to examine it. He was filled with\nterror for Sandy, which would turn into more-than-murderous fury if\nhe found her harmed. The metal floor-plate lay between. He stepped\nobliviously on the plate....\n\nThe universe dissolved around him. The brightly lit masonry wall\nbecame vague and misty. Simultaneously quite other things appeared\nmistily, then solidified.\n\nHe was abruptly in the open air, with a collapsed and ruined structure\nabout and behind him. This was not emptiness, but the surface of a\nworld. Over his head there was a sunset sky. Before him there was\ngrass, and beyond that a horizon, and to his left there was collapsed\nstonework and far off ahead there was a hill which he knew was not a\nnatural hill at all. There was a moon in the sky, a half-moon with\nmarkings that he remembered. There were trees, too, and they were trees\nwith long, ribbony leaves such as never grew on Earth.\n\nHe stood frozen for long instants, and a second, smaller moon came up\nrapidly over the horizon and traveled swiftly across the sky. It was\njagged and irregular in shape.\n\nThen flutings came from somewhere to his rear. They were utterly\nfamiliar sounds. They had distinctive pitch, which varied from one\nto another, and they were of different durations like half-notes and\nquarter-notes in music. And they had a plaintive quality which could\nhave been termed elfin.\n\nAll this was so completely known to him that it should have been\nshocking, but he was in such an agony of fear for Sandy that he could\nnot react to it. His terror for her was breath-stopping. He held his\nweapon ready in his hand. He tried to call her name, but he could not\nspeak.\n\nThe long, ribbony leaves of the trees waved to and fro in a gentle\nbreeze. And then Burke saw a figure running behind the swaying foliage.\nHe knew who it was. The relief was almost greater pain than his terror\nhad been. It was such an emotion as Burke had experienced only feebly,\neven in his recurrent dream. He gave a great shout and bounded forward\nto meet Sandy, crying out again as he ran.\n\nThen he had his arms about her, and she clung to him with that\nremarkable ability women have to adapt themselves to circumstances\nthey've been hoping for, even when they come unexpectedly. He kissed\nher feverishly, panting incoherent things about the fear he'd felt,\nholding her fast.\n\nPresently somebody tugged at his elbow. It was Holmes. He said drily,\n\"I know how you feel, Burke. I acted the same way just now. But there\nare things to be looked into. It'll be dark soon and we don't know how\nlong night lasts here. Have you a match?\"\n\nPam regarded the two of them with a peculiar glint of humor in her\neyes. Keller was there too, still shaken by an experience which for\nhim had no emotional catharsis attached.\n\nBurke partly released Sandy and fumbled for his cigarette lighter. He\nfelt singularly foolish, but Sandy showed no trace of embarrassment.\n\n\"There was a matter-transposer,\" she said, \"and we found it, and we all\ncame through it.\"\n\nKeller said awkwardly, \"I turned on the communicator to base. It must\nhave been a matter-transposer. I thought, in the instrument-room, that\nit was only a communicator.\"\n\nHolmes moved away. He came back bearing broken sticks, which were limbs\nfallen from untended trees. He piled them and went back for more. In\nminutes he had a tiny fire and a big pile of branches to keep it up,\nbut he went back for still more.\n\n\"It works both ways,\" observed Sandy. \"Or something does! There must be\nanother metal plate here to go to the fortress. That huge, crazy bird I\nsaw in the gravity-generator room must have come from here. He probably\nstepped on the plate because it was brightly lighted and--\"\n\n\"You've got your pistol?\" demanded Burke.\n\nThe sunset sky was darkening. The larger, seemingly stationary moon\nfloated ever-so-slightly nearer to the zenith. The small and jagged\nmoon had gone on out of sight.\n\n\"I have,\" said Sandy. \"Pam gave hers to Holmes. But that's all right.\nThere won't be savages. Over there, beyond the trees, there's a metal\nrailing, impossibly old and corroded. But no savage would leave metal\nalone. I don't think there's anybody here but us.\"\n\nBurke stared at something far away that looked like a hill.\n\n\"There's a building, or the ruins of one. No lights. No smoke. Savages\nwould occupy it. We're alone, all right! I wonder where? We could be\nanywhere within a hundred or five hundred light-years from Earth.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Sandy comfortably, \"we should be safe from the Enemy.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Burke. \"If the Enemy has an unbeatable weapon, destroying\none solar system won't be enough. They'll smash every one that humanity\never used. Which includes this one. They'll be here eventually. Not at\nonce, but later. They'll come!\"\n\nHe looked at the small fire. There were curious, familiar fragrances in\nthe air. Over to the west the sun sank in a completely orthodox glory\nof red and gold. The larger moon swam serenely in the sky.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Pam, \"that we won't eat tonight unless we can\nget back to the fortress and the ship. I guess we're farther from\nour dinners than most people ever get. Did you say five hundred\nlight-years?\"\n\n\"Ask Keller,\" grunted Burke. \"I've got to think.\"\n\nFar off in the new night there was something like a birdsong, though\nit might come from anything at all. Much nearer there were peculiarly\nmaternal clucking noises. They sounded as if they might come from a\nbird with a caricature of a bill and stumpy, useless wings. There was\na baying noise, very far away indeed, and Burke remembered that the\nancestry of dogs on Earth was as much a mystery as the first appearance\nof mankind. There were no wild ancestors of either race. Perhaps there\nhad been dogs with the garrison of the fortress, which might be five\nhundred light-years away, in one sense, but could not be more than a\nfew yards, in another.\n\nHolmes squatted by the fire and built it up to brightness. Keller came\nback to the circle of flickering light. His forehead was creased.\n\n\"The constellations,\" he said unhappily. \"They're gone!\"\n\n\"Which would mean,\" Burke told him absently, \"that we're more than\nforty light-years from home. They'd all be changed at that distance.\"\n\nHolmes seated himself beside Pam. They had reached an obvious\nunderstanding. Burke's eyes wandered in their direction. Holmes began\nto speak in a low tone, and Pam smiled at him. Burke jerked his head to\nstare at Sandy.\n\n\"I think I forgot something. Should I ask you again to marry me? Or\ndo I take it for granted that you will?--if we live through this?\"\nHe didn't wait for her answer. \"Things have changed, Sandy,\" he said\ngruffly. \"Mostly me. I've gotten rid of an obsession and acquired a\nfixation--on you.\"\n\n\"There,\" said Sandy warmly, \"there speaks my Joseph! Yes, I'll marry\nyou. And we will live through this! You'll figure something out, Joe. I\ndon't know how, but you will!\"\n\n\"Yes-s-s,\" said Burke slowly. \"Somehow I feel that I've got something\ntucked away in my head that should apply. I need to get it out and look\nit over. I don't know what it is or where it came from, but I've got\nsomething....\"\n\nHe stared into the fire, Sandy nestled confidently against him. She\nput her hand in his. The wind blew warm and softly through the trees.\nPresently Holmes replenished the fire.\n\nBurke looked up with a start as Sandy said, \"I've thought of something,\nJoe! Do you remember that dream of yours? I know what it was!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It came from a black cube,\" said Sandy, \"which was a cube that\nsomebody from the garrison took to Earth. And what kind of cube would\nthey take? They wouldn't take drill-instruction cubes! They wouldn't\ntake cubes telling them how to service the weapons or operate the\nglobes or whatever else the fortress has! Do you know what they'd take?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Novels,\" said Sandy. \"Fiction stories. Adventure tales. To--experience\non long winter evenings or even asleep by a campfire. They were\nfighting men, Joe, those ancestors of ours. They wouldn't care about\nscience, but they'd like a good, lusty love story or a mystery or\nwhatever was the equivalent of a Western twenty thousand years ago. You\ngot hold of a page in a love story, Joe!\"\n\n\"Probably,\" he growled. \"But if I ever dream it again I'll know who's\nbehind those waving branches. You.\" Then, surprised, he said, \"There\nwere flutings when I came through the matter-transposer. They've\nstopped.\"\n\n\"They sounded when I came through, too. And when Pam and Holmes and\nKeller came. Do you know what I think they are?\" Sandy smiled up at\nhim. \"'_You have arrived on the planet Sanda. Surface-travel facilities\nto the left, banking service and baggage to the right, tourist\naccommodations and information straight ahead._' We may never know,\nJoe, but it could be that!\"\n\nHe made an inarticulate sound and stared at the fire again. She fell\nsilent. Soon Keller was dozing. Holmes strode away and came back\ndragging leafy branches. He made a crude lean-to for Pam, to reflect\nback the warmth of the fire upon her. She curled up, smiled at him,\nand went confidently to sleep. A long time later Sandy found herself\nyawning. She slipped her fingers from Burke's hand and settled down\nbeside Pam.\n\nBurke seemed not to notice. He was busy. He thought very carefully,\nrunning through the information he'd received from the black cubes.\nHe carefully refrained from thinking of the desperate necessity for a\nsolution to the problem of the Enemy. If it was to be solved, it would\nbe by a mind working without strain, just as a word that eludes the\nmemory is best recalled when one no longer struggles to remember it.\n\nTwice during the darkness Holmes regarded the blackness about them with\nsuspicion, his hand on the small weapon Pam had passed to him. But\nnothing happened. There were sounds like bird calls, and songs like\nthose of insects, and wind in the trees. But there was nothing else.\n\nWhen gray first showed in the east, Burke shook himself. The jagged\nsmall moon rose hurriedly and floated across the sky.\n\n\"Holmes,\" said Burke reflectively. \"I think I've got what we want. You\nknow how artificial gravity's made, what the circuit is like.\"\n\nTo anybody but Holmes and Keller, the comment would have seemed\nidiotic. It would have seemed insane even to them, not too long before.\nBut Holmes nodded.\n\n\"Yes. Of course. Why?\"\n\n\"There's a chooser-circuit in the globes,\" said Burke carefully, \"that\npicks up radiation from an Enemy ship, and multiplies it enormously and\nbeams it back. The circuit that made the radiation to begin with has to\nbe resonant to it, as the globe burns it out while dashing down its own\nbeam.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Holmes. \"What about it?\"\n\n\"The point is,\" said Burke, \"that one _could_ treat a suddenly\nincreasing gravity-field as radiation. Not a stationary one, of course.\nBut one that increased, fast. Like the gravity-fields of the Enemy\nships, moving faster than light toward our sun.\"\n\n\"Hmmmm,\" said Holmes. \"Yes. That could be done. But hitting something\nthat's traveling faster than light--\"\n\n\"They're traveling in a straight line,\" said Burke, \"except\nfor orbiting around each other every few hours. There's no\nfaster-than-light angular velocity; just straight-line velocity. And\nwith the artificial mass they've got, they couldn't conceivably dodge.\nIf we got some globes tricked up to throw a beam of gravity-field back\nat the Enemy ships, there might be resonance, and there's a chance that\none might hit, too.\"\n\nHolmes considered.\n\n\"It might take half an hour to change the circuit,\" he observed. \"Maybe\nless. There'd be no way in the world to test them. But they might work.\nWe'd want a lot of them on the job, though, to give the idea a fair\nchance.\"\n\nBurke stood up, creaking a little from long immobility.\n\n\"Let's hunt for the way back to the fortress,\" he said. \"There is a\nway. At least two crazy birds were marching around in the fortress'\ncorridors.\"\n\nHolmes nodded again. They began a search. Matter transposed from\nthe fortress--specifically, the five of them--came out in a nearly\nthree-walled alcove in the side of what had once been a magnificent\nbuilding. Now it was filled with the trunks and stalks of trees and\nvines which grew out of every window-opening. There were other, similar\nalcoves, as if other matter-transposers to other outposts or other\nworlds had been centered here. They were looking for one that a plump,\nridiculous bird might blunder into among the broken stones.\n\nThey found a metal plate partly arched-over by fallen stones in the\nvery next alcove. They hauled at the tumbled rock. Presently the way\nwas clear.\n\n\"Come along!\" called Burke. \"We've got a job to do! You girls want\nto fix breakfast and we want to get to work. We've a few hundred\nlight-years to cross before we can have our coffee.\"\n\nSomehow he felt no doubt whatever. The five of them walked onto\nthe corroded metal plate together, and the sky faded and ghosts of\ntube-lights appeared and became brilliant, and they stepped off the\nplate into a corridor one section removed from the sending-transposer\nwhich had translated them all, successively, to wherever they had been.\n\nAnd everything proceeded matter-of-factly. The three men went to the\nroom where metal globes by hundreds waited for the defenders of the\nfortress to make use of them. They were completely practical, those\nglobes. There were even small footholds sunk into their curving sides\nso a man could climb to their tops and inspect or change the apparatus\nwithin.\n\nOn the way, Burke explained to Keller. The globes were designed to\nbe targets, and targets they would remain. They'd be set out in the\npath of the coming Enemy ships, which could not vary their courses.\nTheir circuits would be changed to treat the suddenly increasing\ngravitational fields as radiation, so that they would first project\nback a monstrous field of the same energy, and then dive down it to\npresumed collision with the ships. There was a distinct possibility\nthat if enough globes could be gotten out in space, that at the\nleast they might hit one enemy ship and so wreck the closely orbited\ngrouping. From that reasonable first possibility, the chances grew\nslimmer, but the results to be hoped for increased.\n\nKeller nodded, brightly. He'd used the reading helmets more than\nanybody else. He understood. Moreover, his mind was trained to work in\njust this field.\n\nWhen they reached the room of the many spheres he gestured for Burke\nand Holmes to wait. He climbed the footholds of one globe, deftly\nremoved its top, and looked inside. The conductors were three-inch bars\nof pure silver. He reached in and did this and that. He climbed down\nand motioned for Burke and Holmes to look.\n\nIt took them long seconds to realize what he'd done. But with his\nknowledge of what could be done, once he was told what was needed,\nhe'd made exactly three new contacts and the globe was transformed to\nBurke's new specifications.\n\nInstead of days required to modify the circuits, the three of them\nhad a hundred of the huge round weapons changed over within an hour.\nThen Keller went up to the instrument-room and painstakingly studied\nthe launching system. He began the launchings while Holmes and Burke\ncompleted the change-over task. They joined him in the instrument-room\nwhen the last of the metal spheres rose a foot from the stony floor of\nthe magazine and went lurching unsteadily over to the breech of the\nlaunching-tube they hadn't noticed before.\n\n\"Three hundred,\" said Keller in a pleased tone, later. \"All going\nout at full acceleration to meet the Enemy. And there are six\nobserver-globes in the lot.\"\n\n\"Observers,\" said Burke grimly. \"That's right. We can't observe\nanything because the information would come back at the speed of light.\nBut if we lose, the Enemy will arrive before we can know we've lost.\"\n\nKeller shook his head reproachfully.\n\n\"Oh, no! Oh, no! I just understood. There are transposers of electric\nenergy, too. Very tiny. In the observers.\"\n\nBurke stared. But it was only logical. If matter could be transposed\ninstead of transmitted between distant places, assuredly miniature\nenergy-transposers were not impossible. The energy would no more travel\nthan transposed matter would move. It would be transposed. The fortress\nwould see what the observer-globes saw, at the instant they saw it, no\nmatter what the distance!\n\nKeller glanced at the ten-foot disk with its many small lights and the\nwrithing bright-red sparks which were the Enemy gravity-ships. There\nwas something like a scale of distances understood, now. The red sparks\nhad been not far from the disk's edge when the first space call went\nout to Earth. They were nearer the center when the spaceship arrived\nhere. They were very, very near the center now.\n\n\"Five days,\" said Burke in a hard voice. \"Where will the globes meet\nthem?\"\n\n\"They're using full acceleration,\" Keller reminded him gently. \"One\nhundred sixty gravities.\"\n\n\"A mile a second acceleration,\" said Burke. Somehow he was not\nastonished. \"In an hour, thirty-six hundred miles per second. In ten\nhours, thirty-six thousand miles per second. If they hit at that\nspeed, they'd smash a moon! They'll cover half a billion miles in ten\nhours--but that's not enough! It's only a fifth of the way to Pluto!\nThey won't be halfway to Uranus!\"\n\n\"They'll have fifty-six hours,\" said Keller. The need to communicate\nclearly made him almost articulate. \"Not on the plane of the ecliptic.\nTheir course is along the line of the sun's axis. Meeting, seven times\nPluto's distance. Twenty billion miles. Two days and a half. If they\nmiss we'll know.\"\n\nHolmes growled, \"If they miss, what then?\"\n\n\"I stay here,\" said Keller, mildly. \"I won't outlive everybody. I'd be\nlonely.\" Then he gave a quick, embarrassed smile. \"Breakfast must be\nready. We can do nothing but wait.\"\n\nBut waiting was not easy.\n\nOn the first day there came a flood of messages from Earth. Why had\nthey cut off communication? Answer! Answer! Answer! What could be done\nabout the Enemy ships? What could be done to save lives? If a few\nspaceships could be completed and take off before the solar system\nshattered, would the asteroid be shattered too? Could a few dozen\nsurvivors of Earth hope to make their way to the asteroid and survive\nthere? Should the coming doom be revealed to the world?\n\nThe last question showed that the authorities of Earth were rattled.\nIt was not a matter for Burke or Keller or Holmes to decide. They\ntransmitted, in careful code, an exact description of the sending of\nthe globes to try to intercept the Enemy gravity-ships. But it was\nnot possible for people with no experiential knowledge of artificial\ngravity to believe that anything so massive as a sun could be destroyed\nby hurling a mere ten-foot missile at it!\n\nThen there came a sudden revulsion of feeling on Earth. The truth was\ntoo horrible to believe, so it was resolved not to believe it. And\ntherefore prominent persons broke into public print, denouncing Burke\nfor having predicted the end of the world from his safe refuge in\nAsteroid M-387. They explained elaborately how he must be not only\nwrong but maliciously wrong.\n\nBut these denunciations were the first knowledge the public had\npossessed of the thing denounced. Some people instantly panicked\nbecause some people infallibly believe the worst, at all times. Some\nshared the indignation of the eminent characters who denounced Burke.\nSome were bewildered and many unstable persons vehemently urged\neverybody to do this or that in order to be saved. Get-rich-artists\nsold tickets in non-existent spacecraft they claimed had secretly been\nbuilt in anticipation of the disaster. They would accept only paper\ncurrency in small bills. What value paper money would have after the\ndestruction of Earth was not explained, but people paid it. Astronomers\nswore quite truthfully that no telescope gave any sign of the alleged\nsun-sized masses en route to destroy Earth. Government officials\nheroically lied in their throats to reassure the populace because,\nafter all, one didn't want the half-civilized part of educated nations\nto run mad during Earth's probable last few days.\n\nAnd Burke and the others looked at the images sent back by the\nobserver-globes traveling with the rest. The cosmos looked to the\nobserver-globes just about the way it did from the fortress. There were\ninnumerable specks of light of innumerable tints and colors. There was\ndarkness. There was cold. And there was emptiness. The globe-fleet\ndrove on away from the sun and from that flat plane near which all the\nplanets revolve. Every second the spheres' pace increased by one mile\nper second. Ten hours after Keller released them, they had covered\nfive hundred eighty-eight thousand thousand miles and the sun still\nshowed as a perceptible disk. Twenty hours out, the globes had traveled\ntwo billion six hundred million miles and the sun was the brightest\nstar the observers could note. Thirty hours out, and the squadron of\nten-foot globes had traveled five billion eight hundred thirty-odd\nmillion miles and the sun was no longer an outstanding figure in the\nuniverse.\n\nHouses looked fine-drawn, now, and Pam was fidgety. Keller appeared to\nbe wholly normal. And Sandy was conspicuously calm.\n\n\"I'll be glad when this is over,\" she said at dinner in the ship in the\nlock-tunnel. \"I don't think any of you realize what this fortress and\nthe matter-transposer and the planet it took us to--I don't believe any\nof you realize what such things can mean to people.\"\n\nBurke waited. She smiled at him and said briskly, \"There's a vacant\nplanet for people to move to. People occupied it once. They can do it\nagain. Once it had a terrific civilization. This fortress was just one\nof its outposts. There were plenty of other forts and other planets,\nand the people had sciences away ahead of ours. And all those worlds,\ntamed and ready, are waiting right now for us to come and use them.\"\n\nHolmes said, \"Yes? What happened to the people who lived on them?\"\n\n\"If you ask me,\" said Sandy confidentially, \"I think they went the way\nof Greece and Rome. I think they got so civilized that they got soft.\nThey built forts instead of fighting fleets. They stopped thinking of\nconquests and begrudged even thinking of defenses, though they had to,\nafter a fashion. But they thought of things like the Rhine forts of\nthe Romans, and Hadrian's Wall. Like the Great Wall of China, and the\nMaginot Line in France. When men build forts and don't build fighting\nfleets, they're on the way down.\"\n\nBurke said nothing. Holmes waited for more.\n\n\"It's my belief,\" said Sandy, \"that many, many centuries ago the\npeople who built this fort sent a spaceship off somewhere with a\nmatter-transposer on board. They replaced its crew while it traveled\non and on, and they gave it supplies, and refreshed its air, and\nfinally it arrived somewhere at the other side of the Galaxy. And then\nthe people here set up a matter-transposer and they all moved through\nit to the new, peaceful, lovely world they'd found. All except the\ngarrison that was left behind. The Enemy would never find them there!\nAnd I think they smashed the matter-transposer that might have let the\nEnemy follow them--or the garrison of this fort, for that matter! And I\nthink that away beyond the Milky Way there are the descendents of those\npeople. They're soft, and pretty, and useless, and they've likely let\ntheir knowledge die, and there probably aren't very many of them left.\nAnd I think it's good riddance!\"\n\nPam said, \"If we beat the Enemy there'll be no excuse for wars on\nEarth. There'll be worlds enough to take all the surplus population\nanybody can imagine. There'll be riches for everybody. Joe, what do you\nthink the human race will do for you if, on top of finding new worlds\nfor everybody, you cap it by defeating the Enemy with the globes?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Burke, \"that most people will dislike me very much.\nI'll be in the history books, but I'll be in small print. People who\ncan realize they're obligated will resent it, and those who can't will\nthink I got famous in a disreputable fashion. In fact, if we go back\nto Earth, I'll probably have to fight to keep from going bankrupt. If\nI manage to get enough money for a living, it'll be by having somebody\nghost-write a book for me about our journey here.\"\n\nKeller interrupted mildly, \"It's nearly time. We should watch.\"\n\nHolmes stood up jerkily. Pam and Sandy rose almost reluctantly.\n\nThey went out of the ship and through the metal door with rounded\ncorners. They went along the long corridor with the seeming river of\nlight-tubes in its ceiling. They passed the doorway of the great room\nwhich had held the globes. It looked singularly empty, now.\n\nOn the next level they passed the mess-halls and bunk-rooms, and on the\nthird the batteries of grisly weapons which could hurl enormous charges\nof electricity at a chosen target, if the target could be ranged. They\nwent on up into the instrument-room by the final flight of stairs.\n\nThey settled down there. That is, they did not leave. But far too much\ndepended on the next hour or less for anybody to be truly still in\neither mind or body. Holmes paced jerkily back and forth, his eyes on\nthe vision-screens that now relayed what the observer-globes with the\nglobe-fleet saw.\n\nFor a long time they gazed at the emptiness of deepest space. The\npicture was of an all-encompassing wall of tiny flecks of light.\nThey did not move. They did not change. They did not waver. The\nobserver-globes reported from nothingness, and they reported nothing.\n\nExcept one item. There were fewer red specks of light and more blue\nones. There were some which were distinctly violet. The globes had\nattained a velocity so close to the speed of light that no available\nadded power could have pushed them the last fraction of one per cent\nfaster. But they had no monstrous mass-fields to change the constants\nof space and let them travel more swiftly. The Enemy ships did. But\nthere was no sign of them. There could be none except on such a\ndetector as the instrument-room had in its ten-foot transparent disk.\n\nTime passed, and passed. And passed. Finally, Burke broke the silence.\n\n\"Of course the globes don't have to make direct hits. We hope! If\nthey multiply the gravity-field that hits them and shoot it back hard\nenough, it ought to burn out the gravity-generators in the ships.\"\n\nThere was no answer. Pam watched the screens and bit nervously at her\nnails.\n\nSeconds went by. Minutes. Tens of minutes....\n\n\"I fear,\" said Keller with some difficulty, \"that something is wrong.\nPerhaps I erred in adjusting the globes--\"\n\nIf he had made a mistake, of course, the globe-fleet would be useless.\nIt wouldn't stop the Enemy. It wouldn't do anything, and in a very\nshort time the sun and all its planets would erupt with insensate\nviolence, and all the solar system would shatter itself to burning\nbits--and the Enemy fleet would be speeding away faster than exploding\nmatter could possibly follow it.\n\nThen, without warning, a tiny bluish line streaked across one of the\nscreens. A second. A third-fourth-fifth-twentieth-fiftieth--The screens\ncame alive with flashing streaks of blue-green light.\n\nThen something blew. A sphere of violet light appeared on one of the\nscreens. Instantly, it was followed by others with such rapidity that\nit was impossible to tell which followed which. But there were ten of\nthem.\n\nThe silence in the instrument-room was absolute. Burke tried vainly to\nimagine what had actually happened. The Enemy fleet had been traveling\nat thirty times the speed of light, which was only possible because of\nits artificial mass which changed the properties of space to permit it.\nAnd then the generators and maintainers of that artificial mass blew\nout. The ships stopped--so suddenly, so instantly, so absolutely that a\nmillionth part of a second would have been a thousand times longer than\nthe needed interval.\n\nThe energy of that enormous speed had to be dissipated. The ships\nexploded as nothing had ever exploded before. Even a super-nova would\nnot detonate with such violence. The substance of the Enemy ships\ndestroyed itself not merely by degenerating to raw atoms, but by the\natoms destroying themselves. And not merely did the atoms fly apart,\nbut the neutrons and protons and electrons of which they were composed\nceased to exist. Nothing was left but pure energy--violet light. And it\nvanished.\n\nThen there was nothing at all. What was left of the globe-fleet went\nhurtling uselessly onward through space. It would go on and on and\non. It would reach the edge of the galaxy and go on, and perhaps in\nthousands of millions of years some one or two or a dozen of the\nsurviving spheres might penetrate some star-cloud millions of millions\nof light-years away.\n\nIn a pleased voice, Keller said, \"I think everything is all right now.\"\n\nAnd Sandy went all to pieces. She clung to Burke, weeping\nuncontrollably, holding herself close to him while she sobbed.\n\nOn Earth, of course, there was no such eccentric jubilation. It was\nobserved that crawling red sparks in the gravity-field detectors winked\nout. As hours and days went by, it was noticed that the solar system\ncontinued to exist, and that people stayed alive. It became evident\nthat some part of the terror some people had felt was baseless. And\nnaturally there was much resentment against Burke because he had caused\nso many people so much agitation.\n\nWithin two weeks a fleet of small plastic ships hurtled upward from\nthe vicinity of Earth's north magnetic pole and presently steadied on\ncourse toward the fortress asteroid. Burke was informed severely that\nhe should prepare to receive the scientists they carried. He would be\nexpected to co\u00f6perate fully in their investigations.\n\nHe grinned when Pam handed him the written sheet.\n\n\"It's outrageous!\" snapped Sandy. \"It's ridiculous! They ought to get\ndown on their knees to you, Joe, to thank you for what you've done!\"\n\nBurke shook his head.\n\n\"I don't think I'd like that. Neither would you. We'll make out, Sandy.\nThere'll be a colony started on that world the matter-transposer links\nus to. It might be fun living there. What say?\"\n\nSandy grumbled. But she looked at him with soft eyes.\n\n\"I'd rather be mixed up with--what you might call pioneers,\" said\nBurke, \"than people with reputations to defend and announced theories\nthat are going to turn out to be all wrong. The research in this\nfortress and on that planet will make some red faces, on Earth. And\nthere's another thing.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Sandy.\n\n\"This war we've inherited without doing anything to deserve it,\" said\nBurke. \"In fact, the Enemy. We haven't the least idea what they're\nlike or anything at all about them except that they go off somewhere\nand spend a few thousand years cooking up something lethal to throw at\nus. They tired out our ancestors. If they'd only known it, they won\nthe war by default. Our ancestors moved away to let the Enemy have its\nown way about this part of the galaxy, anyhow. And judging by past\nperformances, the Enemy will just stew somewhere until they think of\nsomething more dangerous than artificial sun-masses riding through our\nsolar systems.\"\n\n\"Well?\" she demanded. \"What's to be done about that?\"\n\n\"With the right sort of people around,\" said Burke meditatively, \"we\ncould do a little contriving of our own. And we could get a ship ready\nand think about looking them up and pinning their ears back in their\nown bailiwick, instead of waiting for them to take pot-shots at us.\"\n\nSandy nodded gravely. She was a woman. She hadn't the faintest idea\nof ever letting Burke take off into space again if she could help\nit--unless, perhaps, for one occasion when she would show herself off\nin a veil and a train, gloating.\n\nBut it had taken the Enemy a very long time to concoct this last method\nof attack. When the time came to take the offensive against them, at\nleast a few centuries would have passed. Five or six, anyhow. So Sandy\ndid not protest against an idea that wouldn't result in action for some\nhundreds of years. Argument about Burke's share in such an enterprise\ncould wait.\n\nSo Sandy kissed him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n...if you enjoyed THE WAILING ASTEROID be sure not to miss\n\n\nTWISTS IN TIME\n\n_by Murray Leinster T389 35\u00a2_\n\nHere are six strange and startling stories, calculated to entrance\nscience-fiction lovers.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
