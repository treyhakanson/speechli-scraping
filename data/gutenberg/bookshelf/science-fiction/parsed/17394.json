It was Akar, the lone he-wolf that had followed\nhis tribe for some time, living off the gnarled scraps of meat that the\nhill-people left behind after every kill.  Kalus had often wondered what\nunaccountable circumstance caused it to leave the safety of the pack to\nstrike out and fend for itself.\n\nAt first he was relieved.  For this was only a scavenger, probably\nhoping to steal an unguarded morsel and slink away unseen.\n\nBut his instincts told him otherwise.  There was something unnerving\nabout the way the beast just stood there, as if unsure of its own\nintentions. Even in the dim light of the cave's entrance he could see\nthat it had not eaten for many days.  Arching ribs protruded sharply\nthrough an emaciated chest, and his eyes were wild with the blood-lust\nof a carnivore.\n\nSomething stirred deep within the young tribesman as he realized the\ntrue hopelessness of its plight.  Cut off from the pack it could not\nhunt successfully, and there now, it stalked a prey it had no chance of\nkilling.  For all around him his comrades lay sleeping, and if aroused,\nthey would kill the intruder without hesitation.\n\nReaching into a crude deerskin pouch slung across his shoulder, he\npulled forth a long strand of cooked meat.  Holding it outward\nenticingly, he motioned toward the terrified hunter.\n\nSlowly, haltingly, the shadow moved forward, too near death from\nstarvation to be cautious.  When it was close enough Kalus tossed the\nmeat gently into the air, where it was snapped up quickly by the waiting\njaws of the hunger-crazed wolf.  Smiling inwardly, he reached into his\npouch once more and prepared to repeat the procedure.\n\nSuddenly from behind him came the sound of angry voices.  Whirling about\nhe saw that the tribesmen had woken, and seeing the wolf, had armed\nthemselves to attack.  The frightened creature turned, but found there\nwas nowhere to run.  Barabbas, leader of the hill-people, had blocked\nthe entrance to the cave and stood there waiting, a long spear clasped\nin his hairy hand.  Forming a circle around the intruder, the tribesmen\nbegan to converge. Helpless, the wolf rolled over in the dirt, as if to\nbeg for mercy. But the tribesmen showed it none, continuing to advance.\n\nBut then a strange thing happened, something that had not been seen on\nEarth since the disappearance of modern man from the continent.  Not\nunderstanding why, or even how he did it, Kalus stepped forward and\nuttered the first word spoken since the day of destruction when all\nhuman tongues had been silenced.\n\n'No!' he cried angrily.  And that was all he said.\n\nA deep silence filled the chamber as his comrades cowered back in\ndisbelief.  The he-wolf slipped out silently---grateful, but puzzled as\nto why he had been spared.\n\nRegaining their senses, the hill-people's astonishment was quickly\nturned to anger and resentment.  For many months they had grown wary,\nand suspicious of the young, tawny-haired hunter.  They could not\nunderstand how this youth could be born of their own flesh, and yet\nstill be so completely unlike them.  For the color of HIS hair was\nlight, and his eyes were a deep blue.  And what of his peculiar desire\nto be on his own?  Unlike the others he did not seem to need the\nprotection of the clan, nor sometimes even to want it.\n\nIt was Barabbas who confronted him first. Speaking through primitive\nsign language, he told Kalus he was angry that he fed and protected the\nintruder, and that if he wished to remain among them, he would have to\ncome to accept the ways of his people.  Shaking his spear menacingly, he\nadded a final note of warning to his primitive demands.\n\nTo the end of his days Kalus would not understand what was about to\nhappen next.  But in that moment of high emotion, it was as if something\nin the true nature of his comrades had been revealed to him for the\nfirst time.  The darkness and evil of their merciless aggression now\nrepulsed and infuriated him, as if some grotesque and twisted visage.\nBitter, roused beyond words, he let out a cry and leapt wildly toward\nthe brutal hill-man.\n\nSurprised but not defenseless, Barabbas met the attack head on. Whirling\nhis weapon with savage skill, he struck Kalus square in the face with\nthe butt of his spear. Stunned, Kalus fell to the ground, and before he\ncould move, found the point of Barabbas' spear held threateningly\nonly inches from his throat.\n\nAnd so, as quickly as it started, the battle was ended. Though a stern\nand forceful leader, Barabbas was not without compassion. Combining sign\nlanguage with angry, animal grunts and gestures, he told Kalus he must\nnow leave the tribe and never return. For by questioning the authority\nof its leader he had committed the one act of disloyalty that could\nnever be forgiven. The other males huddled silently behind him, adding\ntheir mute support.\n\nIt was only then that Kalus realized the full significance of what he\nhad done. Though Neanderthal and ape-like, the hill-people were the only\nfamily he had ever known.  Looking to the back of the cave he saw his\nmother whimpering softly in dismay, and the other women clutching\ntightly to their children, as if uncertain as to what it all meant.\n\nSearching the faces of the men, he found sympathy but not forgiveness.\nHe had been banished, and knew he could never return.\n\nUtterly confused and dejected, he turned and walked slowly through the\nopening and down the shallow, sandy incline which led to the grasslands\nbelow. Looking back one final time, he felt a warm tear trickle bitterly\ndown his reddened cheek. For he knew that his destiny had been changed\nforever, and that life could never again be the way it was before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nTruly alone for the first time in his life, Kalus wandered aimlessly,\ntrying to put back the pieces of all that had happened, and think of the\nthings he must now do to survive.  Though rarely forced to do it, he\nknew he was capable of hunting on his own.\n\nBut hunger was not the real danger.  The valley in which he lived was\nfull of game, but as a result, was also full of predators, many larger\nand more powerful than himself.  He also knew that some were highly\nspecialized killers, and ruthless in their struggle to survive.  Most\nwould kill him without hesitation if they thought he had encroached on\ntheir hard fought, territorial boundaries.\n\nHis mind filled with such thoughts, he was easily startled by the sound\nof padded footfalls behind him.  Whirling about he saw that it was only\nAkar, and that this time there was no danger.  His belly glutted with\nthe fresh meat of a recent kill, he now followed the man-beast more out\nof curiosity than anything else.  He was deeply puzzled by the presence\nof a lone cave-dweller, and even more so when he discovered it was the\nsame creature who had saved his life only hours before.\n\nFor Akar, unlike his primitive ancestors, was a being capable of\nrational thought.  And though resembling in appearance the gray wolves\nof northern Canada, that was where the similarity ended.  Although\nunable to formulate intricate patterns of thought, the wolves of the\nValley had long since existed in well-defined clans, not unlike the\nwolves of Kipling or Tolkien.  The two studied each other a moment in\nsilence.\n\nThen suddenly both man and beast stiffened, simultaneously aware they\nwere no longer alone.  Kalus' sensitive hearing had detected the\nhissing breath of a nearby predator, while Akar's keen nose (he heard\nthe breathing as well) now caught the thick and unmistakable scent of a\nCommodore.  Not wishing to remain and discover its source, the wolf\ndarted quickly away, leaving the man-child alone with his fears.\n\nAs the rasping hiss grew louder and nearer, Kalus headed instinctively\nfor higher ground.  Trapped among the shadows of a narrow canyon he was\nunable to see his pursuer, but knew from the sounds of shuffling stone\nthat it was gaining on him rapidly.  Moving to the craggy bluff upon his\nright he began to climb, hoping his enemy would be unable do the same.\n\nUnfortunately, he was wrong.  Emerging from the darkness the nightmare\ntook a shape.  Raising itself stiff and hunchbacked to the top of a\nmassive, sunlit boulder, it took flesh as an enormous reptilian\ncarnivore, like a tiny lizard slowed, and swelled to immense\nproportions.  Throwback to the rock-climbing monsters of an age long\nforgotten, it moved among the lesser stones with terrifying grace.\nDesperate beyond words, Kalus began searching wildly for shelter.\n\nHis efforts were not in vain. Coming to a crumpled shelf jutting out of\nthe rockface, he spied a small opening just ahead and to his right, and\nwith the giant reptile just a few short yards behind, rushed headlong\nand breathless into the welcome shadows of a small cave.\n\nBut the danger was not yet passed.  Though unable to fit the whole of\nits body into the small enclosure, the lizard was not so easily\ndefeated.  Forcing its head into the mouth of the cave it shot forth a\nlong, snake-like tongue, hoping to catch the man-beast as a frog might\ncapture a fly.  After several narrow misses, Kalus realized that his\nonly hope was to delve deeper into the ever-increasing darkness of the\ncave.  His eyes not yet accustomed to the failing light he moved\ncautiously, not wishing to exchange the present danger for that of a\nblind fall.  Feeling his way slowly along the grainy, lichen-covered\nwalls, he tried to be certain of each advancing step.\n\nBut in spite of all his caution he slipped, and found himself plummeting\ndownward through illusory darkness, a silent scream ringing in his ears.\nSeconds later he landed abruptly.  His last thoughts before losing\nconsciousness were that something must have broken his fall.  For he had\ndropped a considerable distance through the blackness of an underground\nshaft, and knew that by all reason he should have been killed.\n\n\n*\n\n\nHours passed, as the Mantooth's subconscious struggled to keep him\nalive.  A severe blow to the back of the head had brought him to the\npoint of death, and only sheer desire and a tireless will to survive\ncould save him now. Such was a daily occurrence in the\nValley---nature's way of separating the weak from the strong.\n\nBut Kalus had always lived up to such trials in the past, and this was\nto be no exception.  Fighting his way back to consciousness, he opened\nhis eyes to find himself lying on his back in a bed of cool moss covered\nwith furs, his wounds being treated by the soothing hands of a\nwoman-child.  Raising himself weakly, he turned as if in a dream to look\nupon the face of his redeemer.\n\nShe was, without question, the most desirable female he had ever seen.\nYoung and fair, her sun-streaked hair and gold-flecked green eyes were\nhighlighted and contrasted by skin of bronze and trinkets of silver.\nHer muscles were smooth and round; the outline of her breasts showed\nfull beneath a woven garment the likes of which he had never seen.  Her\nraiment, indeed her very face tones and gestures, appeared to him\nstrange and exotic, and it seemed apparent that she had come from a land\nfar away.  Using simplified gestures, he tried to ask her who she was,\nand what hidden passage it was that he had found.  For he sensed that he\nwas still deep underground, and was puzzled by the dancing firelight and\nwarmth all around him.\n\n'Not now,' she whispered softly.\n\nGiving him water from a clay vessel, she motioned for him to lie back\nand rest.  Though he still had many questions he obeyed willingly,\nknowing that his strength was all but gone.  Lying back painfully he\ntried, and finally succeeded, in falling asleep.\n\nThe girl remained beside him on the covered lip of rock that formed her\nbed, looking up at the shaft and wondering at the impossible\ncoincidence.  She reached out once, as if to touch his brow, but drew\nback the hand when she saw that it was trembling.  She gazed at him\nthoughtful and misty-eyed, wondering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nKalus had slept poorly, dreaming of lizards and spiders, and for several\nterrifying moments after first awakening, could not determine where the\ndreams ended and reality began.  Sylviana had watched his troubled\nsleep, and tried to wake him gently when his limbs began to tremble.\n\nBut the girl, gifted from birth with the power of speech, could not\nbegin to understand the anguish that a mind without words was subjected\nto at such a time.  There could be no gentle self-reassurances, no\nsoothing thoughts or voice of comfort from within.  Only her presence,\nand the apparent safety of the chamber, helped bring him back slowly\nfrom the wordless world of darkness and terror in which his spirit\nseemed to linger.  She put a hand to his shoulder but he only pushed it\naway, sitting up and looking about him bewilderedly.\n\nSensing that the time had come for him to be given some answer to his\nunspoken questions, the girl tried speaking to him slowly, using the\nprimitive analogies she hoped he would understand.\n\n'My name is Sylviana,' she began.  'This place you have found\nis called Trialis (a purely fictional name, spawned by the need of the\nmoment).  It is a holy place---the temple of our father, the Sun.'\nShe turned and pointed toward a long, altar-like projection of polished\nstone that jutted unnaturally from the worn granite behind it.  Several\nfeet out from its base, ringed by a circle of stones, burned a small\nfire.  This in turn cast dancing images of light and shadow back upon an\noval mirror, tinted blue-black and mounted securely into the wall above\nthe slab.  In truth they were neither altar nor mirror, but the girl\ncould think of no other way to explain them.\n\nNot that it mattered.  Her words were entirely lost upon the young\noutcast.  He had listened intently, seeing that she wished to\ncommunicate, but could make no sense of the seemingly infinite barrage\nof varying sounds and expressions.  He shook his head and looked at her\nruefully, an expression that betrayed more of himself than he knew.\n\nRealizing that her words meant nothing to him, she decided to summon the\nSpirit (for so he called himself), to see if His words held true.\nHelping Kalus to his feet, she led him slowly and gingerly toward the\naltar.\n\nHe offered no resistance.  Instructing him to remain behind her, she\nstepped carefully past the flame and ascended the three steps leading to\nthe polished projection of stone.  Approaching the mirror she hesitated,\nas if afraid or unsure, then reached out over the stone and touched her\nfingers lightly to the glass, activating the machine.  As the unseen\ncircuitry behind it whirred and came to life, a message was carried by\nthin beams of laser light deep into Space.  She waited a short time,\nthen spoke.\n\n'Great Spirit,' she began, 'Though I do not know your name.\nCome and be among us.  For the man-child has come, even as you said that\nhe would.  But I am confused, and he doesn't seem to understand the\nwords I speak.  I'm terribly afraid that I will do something wrong\nand drive him away, and be left alone in this place. . .forever.\nPlease, if you're really who you say you are then come and show\nyourself to him.  Say something to make him stay.  Please, you must make\nhim stay.'\n\nThough he could not understand the words, Kalus felt the desperation\nwith which they were spoken, and saw plainly that they somehow dealt\nwith him.  Her softness was unlike anything he had ever known.  What\ncould it mean?\n\nA moment later a deep silence fell over the room, and in the gentle\ntension it brought, an outside presence was felt.  Barely noticeable at\nfirst, and then undeniably, the two felt another dimension being added\nto the room.  The colors around them grew suddenly brighter, edged with\ngold, and in the back of their minds they felt the vicarious sensations\nof a great, bodiless spirit swooping downward from the heavens, like a\ngiant eagle diving towards the Earth.  The room became dark, all save\nthe misty blueness of the mirror.  The fire dimmed, as if on cue, and a\npinpoint of brilliant light appeared at the very center of the glass.\nThere it grew in size and intensity until the magnitude of its\nbrightness forced Kalus to shield his eyes and look away. Sylviana stood\nmotionless, face turned and arm raised, disbelieving.  For until now the\nSpirit had spoken to her only as a voice, a signal translated into words\nby the machine.  The image was dimmed to a tolerable brilliance. She\nlowered her arm.\n\nThen a different Voice was heard, deep and alive, like the whisper of\nthe wind and the roar of an ocean.  It was an eternally resilient and\nyet melancholy sound, time-wizened and thoughtful, never fully joyous or\nsad.\n\n'Sylviana,' it began solemnly.  'Sylviana, I have come.  Your\nvigil has not been in vain.  For the Mantooth has been brought to you,\neven as I said that he would.  Be at peace, I will speak to him now as\nyou ask.' Seeming to turn its attention toward Kalus, the Voice began\nagain.  And somehow, though not miraculously, he understood.\n\n'Come, look upon me, young one, and do not be afraid.  There is much\nthat I would say to you.' Slowly Kalus turned back toward the glass,\nbeholding for the first time a sight that few men had ever seen.  There\nbefore him, floating gently amid the vastness of heaven, he looked\ndirect and unhindered into the glowing white-light majesty of a living\ndwarf star.  And whether the true source of the transmission or not, the\nimage itself was real.\n\nSteady and unwavering, the Voice continued.  'Long ago, when my heart\nwas younger, the being that became my flesh gave birth also to many\norbiting spheres.  Most were stillborn, as is often the way of\nheaven. But three lived on.  These have been called by men Venus, Mars\nand the Earth.  Each in its own way and in its own time was capable of\nbearing and supporting new life.  But of the three, the one called Earth\nwas fairest.  Like a fertile womb it lay sleeping, a perfect\ncloud-veiled globe of wide red lands and mighty oceans.  Already the\nthrobbings of life could be seen, as tiny colonies of cells swam\nrestlessly among themselves, waiting only for direction.  It was here\nthen I chose to sow my seed, that life should come from life, and my\nspirit be continued.\n\n'So it was that after a time very long and yet very short, creatures\nof flesh came to swim in Earth's oceans, later to walk upon the land.\nBut still I perceived a great void: there were none to look back and\nwonder, as I did, at the mystery of Universe which had spawned them.\nAnd so, as if it were always meant to be, Man came forward, in truth\nmore of himself than by any action of mine.  He was by far the most\ngifted of Earth's children, with hands freed to toil and mind free to\nthink.  He was a wonder of perception and dexterity.\n\n'But man possessed a terrible flaw, a fault unforeseen in any of my\neager, nuptial thought.  Because of his greater intelligence, man\nperceived that he would one day grow old and die, a certainty unknown to\nhis animal brothers, only guessed at by the wisest.  Realizing this, he\ncould also foresee the inevitable sorrows of sickness and despair, along\nwith a host of imagined terrors his mind could not even give names to.\nIt was from this knowledge that the Demon was born: the Demon of Fear.\n\n'And this fear eventually destroyed man.  Through all his generations\nhe could not overcome it.  Great men rose up, and some who were more\nthan men, to challenge the demon and cast it aside.  Victories were won,\nbut they were not lasting.  Always the fear would change shape and rise\nagain, equally hideous, and often more powerful than before.\n\n'It was in its way a glorious struggle, and at times it seemed that\nEternity held its very breath, as ten thousand eyes from above looked\ndown to see the forces of good and evil do battle in such broad and\nsweeping strokes.  But the cost in human suffering was enormous, and\nafter so many years I knew in my heart that an end was drawing nigh upon\nit.  For Nature carries its own purposes, and will not be denied in the\nexercising of its sharp and merciful will.\n\n'So it was that on a day whose horror I shall never be able to block\nfrom my thoughts, the evil that had grown in Man finally and decisively\novercame the good.  The mind that was given to create, used its cunning\ninstead to devise weapons so powerful and heedless that nothing on Earth\ncould stop them.  And when fear took the hearts and minds of the\nmultitudes they were unleashed, thoughtlessly, one in answer to the\nother, until all reasons for the conflict were lost among the fury and\npanic of destruction.\n\n'Only a handful survived. Six billion voices cried out to me, to save\nthem from the onslaught.  But I haven't the power, young ones.....  I\nhaven't the power.' The air grew thick and heavy around them.\n\n'The seed of Man was all but destroyed, left to sleep for centuries\nin the blackened voids of Time.  It slept, and even had I wished to I\ncould not of my own will revive it.  Only Nature heals the wounds of\ntime.' The Voice paused, as if gathering itself for a final effort.\n\n'But now the flame is alive once more, cradled in your young and\nwilling hearts.  I implore you both, for the sake of those who struggled\nso long and hard before you, spread that flame anew.  Feel the one\npassion that can yet save us, the one emotion that moves even the\ncoldest distant star: the perfect glory of human love.\n\n'Indeed, it is the one gift I have left to give you.  Even now my\ntime grows short, for this place is no longer mine to command.  Kalus, I\nwould ask that you take to your heart the young woman, Sylviana.  Be to\nher strength and shelter, for she is dearer to me than any words can\nhope to express.\n\n'But you must both know, I can promise you nothing.  Your survival\nmust depend on your ability to learn from the ways of Nature, and upon\nyour will and desire to endure.  Kalus, as it is still within my power,\nI return to you now the gift of speech.  Use it wisely. Farewell.'\n\nThen both voice and spirit were gone, and only Earth-life remained in\nthe chamber.\n\n'Wait!' cried Sylviana.  'You can't leave me here, please.\nCome BACK.'\n\nBut even as she spoke the image in the mirror faded, and a narrow beam\nof violet light shot forth from its place in the glass.  Coming to rest\nin the center of Kalus' forehead, it seemed to hold him there against\nhis will. He felt his whole body tingling with an electric sensation\nthat centered at the base of his spine, intensifying as it reached the\nsmooth-folding membranes at the uppermost portion of his brain.  His\nmind churned with unfamiliar sounds and images, as if a thousand tiny\ndoors had suddenly burst open from within, flooding a dark chamber with\nnew and unimagined light.\n\nThen the feeling was gone and the beam released him.  The firelight\nreturned with its dancing glow, as Kalus slumped to the ground.\nRecovering himself enough to be awe-struck, he turned to the girl for\nwhatever explanation she might offer.\n\n'It's all right,' she said reassuringly, though not at all sure\nherself what it meant.\n\nDeep in her own thoughts, she still hadn't noticed the wolf, who had\nslipped in through the darkness once more to be with the woman-child he\nhad befriended.  Sensing her mood it had not tried to attract her\nattention, but waited patiently instead a short distance from the altar.\nKalus saw him.  He pointed.\n\nGrateful for the intrusion, Sylviana descended the steps and went to\ngreet him.  Going down on one knee she gently stroked the soft,\nsilver-gray fur, ruffling his ear and gazing into the peaceful,\nintelligent eyes.  He seemed to readily accept the presence of the\nman-child, and now reminded her more of a harmless pup than of the\nsavage predator she knew he must be in the world outside.  It was Akar,\nof course.\n\n'It's all right,' she began again, turning back to her human\ncompanion.  'He won't hurt you.  The wolf is my friend.'\n\n'Yes,' answered Kalus without thinking.  'I know him well---\n\n'Sylviana!' he stammered.  'I speak!  My mind is all around me.\nHow can these things be?'\n\n'I'm not sure,' she replied honestly.  'But I'm grateful\nfor your company all the same.  I've been here alone for so\nlong.....' She stopped when she saw the weary, washed-out confusion\nof his face.  Though far from happy herself, she realized that in this\nmoment his need was still greater.\n\n'I'm sorry,' she whispered sadly, eyes to the ground.  'You\nhave enough to think about already.' Slowly the words came to her.\n'Try not to worry.  Things will work out for us, you'll see.\nRight now you should eat, then I'll check your bandages and you can\nsleep a while longer.' He nodded gratefully.\n\nSitting weakly on one of the steps, Kalus let his mind go blank.\nSylviana went to prepare a meal as best she could, and the he-wolf\nretired to a favorite corner to lie down.  For the moment, at least, all\nwas as it should have been.\n\nA very rare moment, indeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\nKalus woke feeling strangely insecure.  It was a feeling he had known\nbefore, and one he had come to respect.  Rising quickly, he\ninstinctively scanned his surroundings.  At first he could not remember\nwhere he was.  The events of the day before had struck so suddenly, and\nwith such sweeping change that he found his mind racing, trying to put\nback the pieces of all that had happened, and think what he must now do\nin answer.\n\nSlowly it came back to him.  The piled furs on which he sat had been\nplaced for him there by Sylviana, the young woman-child who lived in\nthis place, some sort of wide underground passageway.  She had nursed\nhis wounds and spoken strangely of a land he would never see.  Of the\nrest he was still quite uncertain, but at least sensed that he was safe,\na knowledge that helped quiet his fears, and soothe the angry horde of\nquestions that kept pounding at his brain.  Looking across the room he\nsaw that the girl lay sleeping a short distance away, lying in a similar\nbed among the shadows of the far wall.  She had tried to make him sleep\nthere instead but he refused, it being so foolishly placed beneath the\nunprotected shaft.  At her feet rested the he-wolf, Akar, the creature\nmost largely responsible for his present plight.  Seeing him Kalus\nremembered his banishment, an event which had yet to make its full\nimpact upon him.  He shook his head in dismay.\n\nHOW WILL I STAY ALIVE? he found himself asking.  EVEN THE WOLF BARELY\nLIVES, AND HE IS BY FAR A GREATER HUNTER THAN I.\n\nThough the thought itself was depressing, Kalus marveled at how quickly\nand clearly it had formed in his mind.  Forced to live without the\ncertainty of words, all previous thought patterns had of necessity been\nbased around images and memory, a slow, tedious process that had almost\nalways stifled him in any attempt at higher thinking.  He thought of the\ngod whose voice he had heard---was that part real or imagined?---and of\nits strange powers inside him.  BUT WHAT DID IT ALL MEAN?  The question\nwas too much for him.  He put it from his mind.\n\nHis thoughts returning to his own survival, he began to search the\nchamber for food.  The girl seemed well fed, and there must doubtless be\na reason. He had known upon sight that she was not a hunter.  Her eyes\nshowed no trace of the desperate aggression so permanently ingrained in\nthe predators of the Valley.  There was a certain look a seasoned\ncarnivore developed, a hardened gleam, hungry and haunting, that\nidentified it instantly to others of its kind.  Sylviana's eyes were\npeaceful and trusting, something which had puzzled him from their first\nmeeting.  And though he could not put the feeling into words, a part of\nhim deeply resented the apparent ease with which she survived.  HER body\nwas clean and unscarred.  Her stomach was full, and her muscles smooth\nand round.  He knew without looking that his own body, though young and\nstrong, bore countless reminders of his own, day to day struggle.\n\nFinding no food in the curving, main chamber, he turned his attention\ntoward a high arching gateway that led deeper into what he now\nrecognized as a large cave.  Though he had not been certain the night\nbefore, the soft light of an early morning sun now clearly illuminated\nits entrance, behind him and to his right, removing any fear that he had\nfallen into some dark and treacherous underground maze.\n\nBut the sheer size of the alcove he now entered, gave rise to a whole\nnew series of questions, the answers to which he feared he would not\nlike.  For all around him lay great mounds of treasure, and strange\nartifacts his mind could not begin to identify.  Piled bronze and silver\ncoins, chalices studded with diamonds and emeralds, rusting weapons of\nevery shape and description met his eyes.\n\nYet these were not what puzzled him.  Such things could also be found\nalong the banks of the river which led to the Island.  No, again it was\nthe sheer size of it all which troubled him.  For both the entrance to\nthe frontal chamber and the arch he had just passed through, were easily\nlarge enough to give passage to creatures infinitely more powerful than\nthe girl.  Why had they not claimed the shelter as their own, or at the\nvery least, made short work of both the girl and her wolf companion?\n\nSearching among the shadowy back reaches of the cave, he found his\nanswer.  There in the darkness, packed together in thick, faintly\nluminous clusters of yellow-green wax, lay several large deposits of\nsebreum, self-synthesized food of the giant praying mantis.\n\n'So that is why she is so well fed,' he scoffed, though deep\ninside he trembled.  'She has been living from the labors of another\ncreature's food supply.' It also explained why no predator, no\nsmart predator at least, had ever dared enter the cave.  He knew that\nsomewhere just outside it, in plain sight for all to see, the massive\ncreature had left its unmistakable mark of possession---the jagged\noutline of a pyramid, burned into the rock by the acidic secretions of\nspecial glands in its throat.  It was a mark none would dare question,\nand to trespass in such a place meant certain death.\n\nFor the Mantis, though not the largest, was without question the\nstrongest and most widely feared monarch of the Valley.  Its triangular\njaws could sever trees in an instant, and the sharp rows of teeth on the\ninstep of its foreclaw could tear even the thickest hide to ribbons.  He\nalso knew that it must soon return to claim the shelter, and would not\nhesitate to kill them all if it found them still lingering near its\njealously guarded treasure room.\n\nKalus paced nervously, trying to resolve an irresolvable conflict within\nhim.  Sylviana had said the night before that she could never leave this\nplace, that she was somehow protected here from the perils of the\noutside world.  Every instinct and emotion he possessed told him not\nleave her.  But the Mantis..... He had no way of knowing that even now\nthe question was being rendered academic.\n\nHearing Akar's deep growl, followed by a scream, he rushed wildly\nback toward the frontal chamber.  Fearing the worst he drew out his\ncrude stone knife.  But at the thought of the Mantis it began to feel\nvery small and useless in his hand. He turned the bend of the enclosure.\n\nThough the creature he found there was not the one he expected, the\ndanger was equally great.  An enormous woolly land spider, too primitive\nto understand the markings above the cave's entrance, stood\nmotionless on the ledge just beyond it, peering into the shelter with\ncautious uncertainty.  Searching for a home, food had not been its main\nobjective.  But Kalus knew it could change its mind at any moment, and\nwas quite capable of devouring them all.\n\n'Sylviana!' he cried desperately.  'To the shaft through which\nI entered.....  Quickly!'\n\nBut the girl, seeing the real-life manifestation of her darkest\nimaginings, could not find it within herself to turn and run.  Instead\nshe stood paralyzed in the center of the floor, staring with total\ndisbelief into the eyes of certain death.\n\nOnly the spider's cautious hesitation saved them.  Seizing her by the\narm, Kalus forced her hurriedly toward the opening above her bed.  Here\nthe wall sloped sharply to meet it.  Helping her up the pitted incline,\nthey entered a broad and irregular chimney in the rock.  Followed by the\ngirl he began winding his way up through the spiraling, almost vertical\npassageway.\n\n'Wait!' cried the girl, regaining her senses.  'What about the\nwolf?'\n\n'He will have to fend for himself!' retorted Kalus angrily.\nTaking her by the arm once more, he forced her onward.\n\nSeeing a pale yellow light filter down from above, he finally relented,\nslowing their pace.  Stopping to rest on a narrow ledge far beyond the\npoint where the spider could reach them, he felt his heart pounding\nuncontrollably.  As it did so it sent angry waves of blood pulsing\nsharply through his veins, aggravating the deep head wound he had\nsustained the day before.  The pain, though not excruciating, combined\nwith the fear and frustration of the moment to form the totally negative\nand inescapably fatalistic frame of mind which had haunted him since\nchildhood.  All his thoughts, worded and otherwise, now seemed to crash\nin upon themselves like the breaking of a wave, crushing and smothering\nevery positive impulse, every hopeful thought inside him.  Hanging his\nhead in a gesture of forced surrender he breathed heavily, mouth open,\nand waited for the feeling to pass.\n\nSeeing his despair, Sylviana was moved in a way she could not explain.\nHaving lived most of her life in sheltered seclusion, all such powerful\nemotions had existed for her only in books, and always seemed somehow\npretentious and unreal.  To see it now in undeniable reality, affected a\ndual response within her.  She felt at once both selflessly\ncompassionate, and selfishly afraid.  Again she thought of her friend.\n\n'Kalus?' she asked softly, trying hard not to upset him.  'What\nwill happen to the wolf?' He started to answer gruffly, but seeing\nher anguish, mellowed his tone.\n\n'He will be all right,' he said.  'Akar knows the ways of\nescape like no other.....  The spider has the mind of an ant. He is not\nin danger.' Though he had stretched the truth, he hoped she would\nbelieve him.  In his heart he knew that the wolf was probably dead, or\nat best, trapped in some dark corner of the cave, hoping the spider\nwould not find him.\n\nBut if he intended to calm her he had failed miserably.  Something he\nsaid unknowingly, had upset her even more.  'Are all the insects of\nyour world as large as the spider?' She asked sincerely, hoping to\nGod the answer was no.  The thought of a swarm of giant ants had sent a\nchill straight through her.\n\n'Insects?'\n\n'Crawling things with many legs.'\n\n'Of course not,' he said, shaking his head at her ignorance.  How\ncould she have lived so long and still know so little of the ways of the\nValley?  But he was no longer angry with her.  The intensity of the pain\ndying down, he had actually begun to derive some new sort of pleasure\nfrom hearing the sound of her voice.\n\n'Except for the spider and the mantis,' he continued, 'They\nrarely grow to be much longer than your hand.' Though the answer was\nhardly reassuring, at least she sensed that he meant well, something she\nhad not been at all sure of before.\n\n'Come,' he said, feeling unusually benevolent.  'There is a\nsmall cave just ahead.  We will be safe there.' Taking her by the\nhand, they climbed the remaining distance carefully, coming at last to\nthe wide, shoulder-high cavity that had given him refuge once before.\n\nHe searched it quickly before letting the girl enter.  But finding it\nuninhabited, he helped her up, then lay down and basked in the first\nreal safety he had known for several days, seeming to take no further\nnotice.\n\nBut Sylviana could find no such release.  Crouching on one knee in the\nlight of the smaller cave's entrance, she could think only of her\nfriend, the gentle wolf, trapped beyond all help in the lower cave.\n\nRealizing there was nothing more she could do, she remained there in\nuncertain melancholy, her mind buried deep in her thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nPeering down at the entrance of the larger cave, Sylviana kept her\nvigil.  Kalus had long since fallen asleep, something which troubled her\ndeeply.  She could not understand how he could be so indifferent about\nthe fate of her only friend.  She herself had remained on the lip of\nrock just beyond the smaller niche for what seemed an eternity, and\nstill had seen no sign of either wolf or spider.\n\nShe had passed much of the time by studying the awesome landscape that\nopened so broadly before her, her first unobstructed view.  And she\ncould summon just enough geology and topography to be both puzzled and\nintrigued by the inexplicable diversity of it.\n\nTo the left of them, due south at a distance of roughly five miles, lay\na massive sandstone ridge, descending from a high central erg in two\nlong arms that reached out west and southwest beyond the edge of sight.\nEroded by wind and water, it reminded her most of photographs she had\nseen of Monument Valley in the west, though not so old or well defined.\n\nThen there was the phenomenon of the line of granite cliffs from which\nshe now surveyed the valley.  As nearly as she could tell it ran\ndirectly north-south at an altitude varying from five- to\nfifteen-hundred feet.  At its base, directly below them, a shallow gorge\ncrept slowly southward to end in a shadowed overhang at the foot of the\nsandstone ridge.  How the two lines of vastly divergent rock had come\ntogether to form such a neat corner she could not guess.  Perhaps\nviolent flooding had deposited the sand during a great turmoil of the\nsea, then left it to slowly age and weather through the intervening\ncenturies.  How many she dared not even think.  The contrast between the\ntwo was like day and night.\n\nAnd to the southwest there occurred yet another bizarre conflict.\nDirectly in front of them, across the gorge, lay a vast and\ngentle-hilled grassland, dotted with muddy pools and small clusters of\nwide, African-looking trees.  Large herds of grazing animals sauntered\nacross it at a distance which defied close description.  But at the foot\nof the sandstone was only cactus and desert prairie.  The meeting of the\ntwo, in a long zig-zagging line between rows of opposing hills, was\nawkward at best.\n\nAnd farther west, beyond the savanna larger hills appeared, covered with\ntrees and high bramble, leading away out of sight.  The horizon to the\nnorth was similar, but here the hills were sharper, velveted with pine,\nand broken by stark projections of weather-worn granite, apparently the\noldest and most \u0091natural' part of the Valley.  That is, she\nthought, they seemed the least out of place.\n\nShe tried hard to read its subtle clues, but still the riddle of\nconflicting landscapes eluded her.  The only certainty was that the\nnuclear holocaust had been everything its foretelling prophets had said\nit would be: a complete annihilation of the world she had known, with a\nsavage and unpredictable rebirth.\n\nLike echoes of a mournful dream, all manner of warm and painful memories\nnow seemed to come to her from out of the day, phantoms of a past too\nbeautiful to be real.  She thought of her peaceful home in the wooded,\nnortheastern town.  Her father, her friends.  All dead.  Why had she\nbeen left to go on living?  She remembered the words of the Spirit:\n'glorious struggle,' and 'the flame within.' But where was\nthe glory when all she could feel was pain and emptiness?  Where was He\nnow?  And as she looked out upon the scene that Nature played before\nher, she realized for the first time and with crushing certainty that\nlife was finite.  Physical reality . . .was real.  The message hammered\ninto her relentlessly: all things must one day pass.  She would die, as\na hundred billion creatures had died before her.  DIED.\n\nIt all became too much.  Seeking escape, her mind returned to the\npresent.  But that only made her think of her friend, the gentle wolf,\nstill trapped inside the cave, still in great danger.  And as the sun\ncontinued to set far in the west, turning sky to purple and clouds to\npink, she had all but given up hope when the downward spiral of her\nthoughts was broken by the gentle tremor of wings overhead.\n\nThe sound seemed to come from above and behind her, moving with\ndeliberate slowness toward the nearer reaches of the sandstone ridge,\nnow painted a deep orange-red and pocked with growing shadows.\nStraining her eyes in the failing light, she thought she saw a large,\nmulti-winged creature land gracefully atop a weathered crag that shot up\nhigh above the rest.  But in the distance and gathering darkness she\ncould not be sure.\n\n'Kalus!' she whispered loudly. 'Come quick, there's\nsomething out there.'\n\nStartled but alert, the man-child rose instantly.  Moving to join her at\nthe entrance, what he saw filled him with fierce pride.  For there in\nthe distance, perched majestically in dark silhouette against a fading\nsky, his eyes perceived the outline of the Mantis, undisputed monarch of\nthe Valley.  Even at that distance he could read its features clearly:\nthe stately upper body, the foreclaws held so effortlessly, and the\nsmallish, triangular head, pivoting easily to scan the domain that was\nhis and his alone.\n\n'The Mantis!' he exclaimed, trying hard to keep his voice down.\n'Now we will see what happens to those foolish enough to cross\nhim!'\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe Mantis remained motionless, breathing hard.  Though capable of\nflying great distances, the sheer weight of its body made such journeys\nan exhausting ordeal.  He was weary to his very heart.  But the Mantis\nwas also a master of stamina and self-discipline.  He knew he had only\nto rest a short time and his strength would come back to him.\n\nHe had landed on the ridge intentionally.  It had been many days since\nhe last slept in the cave, and he wanted to be sure there was no danger.\nNot that he was afraid---in his conscious thought he feared nothing.  He\nsimply had no desire to encounter a powerful enemy before regaining his\nfull strength.  But as the breaths began to come easier, he felt his\nantennae tingling with anticipation.  Somewhere. . .somewhere near, he\nsensed the presence of a spider.  The vibrations seemed to come from the\ndirection of his cave.\n\nRealizing the failing light worked against him, he knew he would have to\nact quickly.  Unfurling his four translucent wings, he lifted himself\nslowly into the air.  Hovering closer, he searched for clues while\nreading the subtle currents of air that curled gently across the\nwindface.  He stopped once in mid-air, turned, then surrendering to wind\nand gravity, swooped down upon the broad ledge that bordered the\nentrance of the cave.\n\nResting for a moment just beyond its gothic arch, he felt a sullen anger\nrise within him.  Though not a vindictive creature, the thought of an\nenormous land spider keeping him from the rest and shelter of his lair\nsent waves of liquid anger pulsing sharply through his veined and\nveinless body.  He did not try to stem the feeling, knowing that in\ncertain measure it gave him strength.  He simply allowed the bitterness\nto occur inside him, strong and distasteful, then waited for the long\nwisdom of his mind to diffuse it.  He did not bemoan his fate, nor think\nto question the will of the Nameless.  He knew what he was, and what he\nmust do.  Summoning a courage born of countless similar encounters, he\ndrew in his foreclaws and entered the cave.\n\nSurprised and alarmed, the spider reacted in the only way it\nknew. Feeling trapped, it rushed directly at him.  The Mantis\nmethodically yielded his ground, leading it out onto the ledge.\n\nOnce out in the open the spider slowed, and the two adversaries squared\noff, each in its own way trying to assess the relative size and strength\nof the other.  To the Mantis it was just another battle, dueling a foe\nit had fought many times in the past.  But to the spider, still young,\nit was an entirely new and utterly terrifying experience.  Though not\nintelligent enough to recognize the mantis as its mortal enemy, every\ninstinct it possessed warned of extreme danger.\n\nMoving to the place on the ledge he had prepared for just such a\nconflict, the Mantis dug his four hook-clawed hind legs into carefully\netched footholds in the rock.  Swaying from side to side he tightened\nhis grip, extending his foreclaws to the limit.  Then pawing the air\nlike a boxer, he stood ready for the spider's charge.\n\nIn a way he almost felt sorry for it.  He could see that it was young\nand inexperienced, and as such stood no real chance against him.  But he\nalso knew that it was his place in Nature to kill it.  There could be no\nmoral question here, only death for one and survival for the other.  And\nthe Mantis had no intention of dying.\n\nConfused and afraid the spider charged.  The Mantis simply waited for it\nto rush blindly into his outstretched foreclaws, then clamped down\nsharply on the thorax joints of its first four legs.  Holding it\nsecurely in place, he used his superior height to bring down powerful\njaws upon its vulnerable forehead.  From there it was only a matter of\nritual.  The acidic saliva softened its thick outer skeleton, while the\nrazor-sharp triangular jaws tore away with frightening precision.  The\ntarantula strained mightily, but could not free itself from the\nmantis' vice-like grip.\n\nDeath was painful but swift. In a matter of seconds the spider's eyes\nand forehead were gone.  It felt a moment of searing pain, followed by a\nshudder, and the darkness and terror were gone forever.\n\nDragging the lifeless corpse to the rim of the ledge, the Mantis flung\nit wearily into the gorge.  His limbs trembling with exhaustion, he\nturned and strode slowly to the safety of his lair.  Reaching the\nentrance, he thought he caught a glimpse of shadow dart past him and\ninto the gathering night, but by then could no longer care.  Sleep was\nall that mattered now---sleep, and then food. And then sleep again.\n\n\n*\n\n\n'Death to the spider!' proclaimed Kalus, trying hard to keep his\nvoice down.  'Long life to the Mantis, protector of all who live in\nValley.' He turned and started to reenter.\n\n'Kalus?' asked the girl tentatively.  'Don't you feel even a\nlittle sorry for the spider?  I mean. . .he is dead now.' She felt\ncompelled to say something, though she wasn't sure that was it.  He\nstopped and considered this, puzzled.\n\n'Sylviana.  You misread my emotions.  It is not hate for the spider\nbut love for the Monarch I feel.  Without him none in the Valley would\nbe safe, even for a short time.  Still, it is hard to feel sorrow for\none who could so easily and thoughtlessly take my life.  But perhaps\nthat is the way of things.  To the wolves---'\n\n'Oh my God. Kalus.  What will happen to him now?'\n\n'Sylviana,' he answered coldly.  'Not only do you know nothing\nof the ways of this land, but your eyesight is poor as well.  If Akar\nwas still in the cave---he is not---there would be no danger.  The\nwolves are ancient allies of the mantis.' He spoke proudly now,\nfilled with the knowledge that he alone among his people knew of this\nrelationship.  'The wolves, like all hunters, are hurt by the\npresence of spiders.  When one is spotted by the pack, a runner is sent\nto bring the Mantis.  Then the others keep it in sight, until the\nMonarch arrives to kill it.'\n\nThe girl had listened, but only enough to know when he had finished\nspeaking.  She was still deeply concerned about her friend.\n\n'What do you mean he's no longer in the cave?'\n\n'Just as I said,' he replied without looking at her.  He was far\ntoo excited by the presence of the Monarch to let her childish ignorance\nupset him.  'He slipped out just before the Mantis entered.'\n\n'Then we should call to him, let him know where we are.' Kalus\ncould only shake his head at his companion's needless worry.  'He\nknows where we are.  He just doesn't want the Mantis to know it too.\nOr did you not know he could kill us even more easily than the\nspider?' Again he was surprised by her reaction.  She seemed hurt and\nafraid.  'Don't worry,' he added more softly.  'He will come\nto you before the night is over.  You should not worry for him so.  He\nhas been guarding his own life far longer than you and I.'\n\n'I'm sorry,' she confided.  'It's just that this is all\nso new to me.  I don't know what it means sometimes. . .and I'm\nscared.'\n\n'That is not a bad thing.  I too am scared, but do not let myself\nthink it.  We are safe here, for this night at least.  You should sleep.\nWe have many hard choices in morning.'\n\nShe did not answer, but looked into his eyes as if searching for\nsomething.  Then she turned, lowered her head, and moved past him into\nthe shelter.  Finding a place where fewer stones piqued the floor, she\ncrouched and looked back at him, unsure.  Kalus remained motionless,\nreturning her gaze.  Finally she lay back and turned away, her eyes\nmisting.\n\n'Kalus?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Thank you. . .for saving my life.'\n\n'You forget that you fed me, and cared for my wounds.'\n\n'Still.....' She let her voice trail off.\n\nWithout further speech Kalus seated himself just inside the entrance,\nwatching her wistfully as she drifted off into sleep, protected from\noutside danger by his own life, and by the pervasive and\nall-encompassing presence of the Mantis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\nAkar entered soundlessly just before dawn, the rabbit clenched securely\nin his teeth.  Purposely avoiding the man-child, he moved instead to the\nplace where his mistress lay sleeping.  He placed the kill in front of\nher, gently nudging her with his snout.\n\nStartled from an uneasy sleep the girl bolted stiffly upright, choking\nback a scream.  Seeing her friend she subsided, but too late to prevent\na confrontation.  Alerted by the sound Kalus had woken, and was in no\nmood for the treatment he was about to receive from the wolf.\n\n'He's brought us a meal,' he said contentedly, rubbing the\nsleep from his eyes.  The girl still hadn't seen the carcass.  He\npointed.\n\n'Oh, take it away,' she said in disgust, repulsed by its sunken\neyes and contorted expression.  'Take it away.' Coming closer\nKalus started to reach for it, but was halted by the bared teeth and\nfierce snarling of the wolf.\n\n'It seems he wants you to have it.' He paused a moment, thinking.\n'Your friend has a short memory,' he said coldly, pretending to\nlose interest.  'When he was hungry I shared my meat with him.'\n\nIn the split second it took for Akar to look up at him, Kalus reached in\nand snatched up the carcass.  The wolf started to go after him, but\nfound the jagged point of Kalus' knife held threateningly between\nhimself and the kill.  As he backed away the two squared off, Kalus on\none knee and the wolf standing.  Akar began to circle, looking for an\nopening.  But the man-child turned with him, keeping the point of the\nknife between himself and danger.  The girl cried out in desperation.\n\n'Stop it!  Please, stop it!'\n\nShe had tried to understand the reasons for violence in the harsh world\nshe now encountered, but to see her only two companions ready to tear\neach other apart over a blood-stained carcass, was more than she could\nbear.  Bowing her head between clutching arms like a frightened child,\nshe wept bitterly.  But the tears brought no relief, only deeper anguish\nand despair.\n\nSeeing her distress the two stopped circling.  Akar went to try and\ncomfort her, while Kalus moved indifferently to a protected corner to\ngut and skin the carcass.  He would undoubtedly have been more\nsympathetic had he not been hurt several times already by giving in to\nsimilar emotions.  He was far too angry now to think of anything but his\nown survival.  Akar no longer tried to comfort his friend, who only kept\npushing him away.  Regaining her composure, she glared bitterly at both\nof them.\n\n'Why do you have to BE like this?  Why can't you just leave each\nother alone?'\n\nAkar had not understood the words, but their meaning was clear enough.\nPutting away his pride, he stepped slowly and deliberately toward the\nman-child's unmoving form.  Coming closer he drew a line in the dirt\njust in front of him, signaling his desire for a truce.  If Kalus\ncrossed the line with one of his own it would mean that the truce had\nbeen accepted, if only for the moment.\n\nBut Kalus did not answer with words and gestures of humbled acceptance.\nMoving his hands in simple patterns he knew the wolf would understand,\nhe told him instead that he was angered to the point of violence by his\ningratitude, reminding him that if it had not been for his own, selfless\nactions, neither he nor the girl would be alive at all.  He then drew\nanother line in the dirt, not across the mark Akar had made, but\nparallel to his own body instead, signifying dominance, and made it\nclear that the wolf could either accept the truce under these terms, or\nfight him to the death then and there.\n\nAkar was curiously gratified by the man-child's response. In truth he\nhad not forgotten his compassion, but wanted to be sure that he was\nworthy of trust. Goodness and compassion were one thing, courage in the\nface of danger quite another. To say that he had wholly staged the\nconflict as a test of the other's spirit would be incorrect; but once\nit developed into such he did not try to stop it. Akar had lived too\nlong to give his allegiance easily or in haste. Crossing Kalus' line\nsolemnly, he rolled over on top of his own, blurring it into obscurity.\n\nRealizing what this meant Kalus relaxed, nodding gratefully.  Though he\nknew the wolf had no intention of being dominated, he accepted the\ngesture nonetheless.  His body weak from adrenalin's flow, he could\nnot have backed up the threat if he wanted to.  He did not.  The truce\nwas accepted.  He reached out an open hand, letting his new-found ally\nlearn its scent beyond the point of any doubt.  The wolf then went back\nto the girl while Kalus returned to the task of skinning the rabbit,\ntrying to keep his hands from shaking as he did so.\n\n'You see,' he said, speaking as much to himself as to the girl.\n'Things are not always as they first appear.  Your friend was only\ntesting me.  Now we are brothers, as we could not have been before.'\nShe nodded halfheartedly, not at all sure she believed him.\n\n'You won't fight anymore, will you?  Please promise me you\nwon't.'\n\n'We will not fight.' He continued his work.\n\nThere was a pause in which neither spoke.  Finally Kalus broke the\ndeadlock with a question.  He truly wished to know its answer, but also\ndisliked the awkwardness that silence had placed between them.\n\n'Sylviana. You speak as one who comes from far away.  Are you then\nfrom the Island?'\n\n'What island?'\n\n'The Island of Ruins across the water.'\n\n'No.....  No, I don't think so.' She struggled now, trying to\nfind the words to tell him that she came not only from a different\nplace, but from a different time as well.  It didn't matter.  She\nwasn't going to have the chance. In their preoccupation with\nthemselves the three had forgotten the Mantis.  Awakened by the noise of\ntheir scuffle, it climbed toward the inadequate shelter even as they\nspoke.\n\nIt was Akar who sensed his presence first.  Though he could not be\ncertain of the scent, the wind being in the opposite quarter, the low,\nscratching sound of hooked claws searching for footholds was\nunmistakable. He did not try to run, nor even to alert the others, but\nwent without hesitation to wait for the monarch at the entrance of the\nniche.  He only hoped the Mantis would remember him.\n\n'What is he doing?' asked the girl.  At the same moment Kalus\nheard a loosened stone sent plummeting to the bottom of the canyon.  Its\ndry echo sounded sharp and clear below.\n\n'Sylviana, listen to me carefully.' He spoke firmly, moving\ncloser.  'The mantis is coming toward us.  Do not cry out---he\nprobably won't hurt us.  But you must do everything I say without\nquestions.'\n\n'Go on,' she whispered intently, surprised by her own courage.\n\n'When the Mantis appears at the entrance you must act helpless and\nafraid, but afraid of him and not of me.  Also, do not try to speak.\nAkar will speak for us.  Here, he draws closer.  When you first see him,\nhold on to me tightly, as if shocked and startled.  We must make him\nthink you have never seen him, and had no knowledge this mountain was\nhis.  Now.  Prepare yourself!'\n\nWhen the Mantis' head finally did appear, leering in at them\nominously, she found doing exactly as he told her infinitely easier than\nnot doing it.  She clung to him as if possessed, and the Mantis'\nfirst glimpse of them was exactly as Kalus had wanted it.  Akar stood\nsubmissively to one side, allowing the Monarch an unobstructed view.\nAfter studying the three closely, he gestured for the wolf to follow him\nto the broad ledge outside the larger cave.  Akar obeyed\nunquestioningly, snaking his way carefully down the sharp incline.\n\n'What will he do now?' asked the girl, moving with Kalus to watch\nfrom the stone lip that ran like a low parapet just beyond the entrance\nof the niche.\n\n'I do not know.  He will want to know why we are here, but after that\nI cannot say.  But I think if he was going to kill us he would have done\nit already.' The girl was quietly stunned by the calmness with which\nhe said the words.\n\nOnce down on the ledge, the two communicated in a way known only to\nthemselves: Akar through a series of short barks and body movements, the\nMantis through subtle movements of his antennae, foreclaws and upper\nbody.  Kalus could only guess at their meaning.  Roughly translated,\nthis is what passed between them.\n\n\nSkither (The Mantis)- Wolf.  Was it you then that snuck from my cave\nlike a thief in the night?\n\nAkar- Yes, mighty one.  I was trapped inside by the spider.\n\nSkither- But why were you in the cave at all?  Have you lost all respect\nfor my sovereignty?\n\nAkar- No, master.  I was protecting the woman-child, to whom I owe my\nlife.  I do not understand her words, but she speaks of having woken\nfrom a long sleep, and finding herself in your lair.  I tried to make\nher leave it many times, but she believes she is somehow protected there\nby gods I do not know.  When I told her the cave was yours, she wished\nonly to remain there until your return.  She is deadly fearful of the\nworld outside your domain.\n\nSkither- Do not flatter me, wolf.  I have not grown so old as to be\nfeeble and weak of mind.\n\nAkar- Forgive me.\n\nSkither- Tell me, then.  Does she speak of having come from the long\nsilver box?\n\nAkar- Yes, I believe it is so.  What does this mean?\n\nSkither- I'm not certain.  Three moon-cycles past I was journeying\nfar to the north and west among the mountains that grow there.  At the\nbase of one such peak I found a broad and unnatural tunnel that led deep\ninto the earth.  Searching it for spiders, I came across a chamber\nfilled with many strange and beautiful things.  I forgot all else for\nthe wonder of it.  But the thing I would most have for myself was the\nlong silver box.  Inside it was the body of a woman-child, your mistress\nit seems.  She was fair of face and skin, and I grieved for her.  I\ntried to touch her, but was stopped by a film which was there, and yet\nwas not there (fiberglass).  Breaking free the webs that held her\n(life-support tubes and wires), I brought her here to my cave, thinking\nshe was dead.\n\nBut this passing is not important now.  You and she are both welcome on\nmy mountain.  It is the man-beast I do not trust.  His kind are\ntreacherous and unpredictable, and they carry with them the fire that\nkills.\n\nAkar- But he is not like them, Master.  He is an outcast, like myself,\nand worthy of trust.  To him also, and more deeply, I am indebted for my\nlife.\n\nSkither- It seems you owe your life many times, my friend.  How is it\nthat the brother of Shaezar has come to lead such a perilous existence?\n\nAkar- ...  Shaezar is dead, killed by a rival while I was away.  I could\nnot serve in a pack whose unwanted leader had slain my true brother, so\nI set out to live on my own.  The days have indeed been perilous, but I\nhave vowed never to return.\n\nSkither- This is evil news you bring me.  Shaezar was a wise and noble\nleader.  I grieve for him.  It seems that many things have changed in my\nabsence.  (A pause).  Very well, then.  Send the man-beast down to me.\nI would have words with him.\n\nAkar (sadly)- As you command it.\n\n\nMoving to the northern and uppermost portion of the ledge, Akar looked\nup to the place where the others stood waiting.  Barking sharply three\ntimes in succession, he summoned the man-child to come down.\n\n'What is he saying?' asked the girl.\n\n'The Mantis wishes to speak to me.  I hope that is good.  Wait for me\nhere, I will return as soon as it is safe.'\n\nFeeling terribly small and exposed Kalus began to descend, running\nquickly through his mind all the things he wanted to say, while trying\nto muster the courage to say them.  Stepping weak-kneed out onto the\nledge, he felt his heart pounding, and as he approached the Mantis'\nawesome form, felt both hope and despair arise with equal strength\ninside him.  His mind raced.  Had he read the moment correctly?  Did he\ndare ask for refuge?  How would they live if the Monarch refused him?\nThe moment was upon him; there was no time to ponder.\n\nBowing low, he saluted the Mantis.  Using modified arm and wrist\nmovements he hoped the other would understand, he signaled the following\nwords.\n\n'Great Leader,' he began.  'I am called the Carnivore. Do you\nread the meaning of my hands?' The Mantis nodded.\n\n'I am sorry for my presence on the mountain.  As an outcast, I wished\nonly to live in the safety of your shadow, but was pursued here by a\nCommodore, and forced to take refuge in the smaller cave above your\nown.' He pointed, adding after an intentional pause.  'It seems\nthey have grown bold in your absence.' He looked up quickly, but the\nMantis didn't flinch.\n\n'Great King,' he continued, anxiety rising with each coming\ngesture.  'I am no longer one with my people, and live without a\nhome.  The same is true of the female you saw with me.  I would have her\nas my own, but she is not yet able to protect herself in the wild.....\nThere is something I would ask of you.' Still the Mantis did not\nmove.  There was no putting it off any longer. He would have to ask him\nnow.\n\n'I know why you have gone away,' he began nervously.  'And why\nyou must leave again soon.....  The mating of the spiders has reached\nits middle season, and will not end for many days to come.  You and your\ngod-friends have many battles yet to fight.'\n\n'Why do you speak this lie?' signaled the Mantis angrily.\n'Where do the hill-people hear such a thing?'\n\n'My people know nothing of this,' he answered, as calmly as he\ncould.  'And I would never tell them.  Your secret is known only to\nme, and I tell no one.  I swear it.'\n\nSkither remained motionless, puzzled by the presence of the strange and\nknowing child.  Utterly intrigued, he searched the back of his mind for\nthe meaning of their encounter.\n\n'What is it then you would ask?'\n\n'Since you are called again to the holy task, your lair will again be\nleft unguarded.  I would ask that you allow the three of us to remain\nhere on the mountain, in the smaller cave above your own.  Though each\nof us alone are small, together we could create the illusion that you\nhad not left it.'\n\n'But how, and for what reason do you do this?'\n\n'My friends and I have only a short march of days before the\nCommodore must sleep, and many other predators follow the herds to the\nSouth. If you allow me, I could turn our shared need into shared\nhelp.'\n\n'Go on.'\n\n'I have learned in my youth to make a sound like the flutter of your\nmighty wings.  And Akar could descend daily to the grasslands in plain\nsight, as if your messenger to the wolf packs below.'\n\n'How would you make this sound?' Skither was perplexed, and felt\nan odd sense of antiquity as he gazed upon the complex and far-reaching\nintelligence of one so young.  And he had not failed to note the subtle\ndifferences of his appearance: the knowing eyes, the smoother, more\nrefined features.  SO UNLIKE HIS PEOPLE, he thought.  AND THE GIRL.\nWhat could it mean?  His thoughts were broken off as Kalus answered.\n\n'The sound is made by stretching a skin between two trees, then\nsoaking it with water and leaving it to dry in the sun.  When it has\ntightened between them it is beaten rapidly with club-ended sticks,\nmaking a sound like the rhythm of your mighty wings.'\n\n'But how will you use it here, where there are no trees?  And why do\nyou think that my enemies will believe it, when the sound comes from\nonly one place?'\n\n'It can be built on a frame,' he answered.  'And moved to\ndifferent places along the ridge.  That way the sound can be sent\nechoing down the canyon, and seem to come from many places at once.'\n\nSkither looked down at him thoughtfully.  His first instincts told him\nnever to trust a man-beast.  But these were difficult times.  Yielding\nto the unspoken Tao he consulted the wind, to see what hidden message it\nmight carry.\n\nA cool breeze swirled about him; the valley grasses swayed with a\ngolden, browning color on the plains below.  He felt the seasons\nchanging.  But more than that he felt his world changing, yielding\nslowly to some new order in which he was to play no part. It was not the\nfirst time.  The feeling had often puzzled (and frightened) him.  There\ncould be no denying the double reason for their meeting: the air was\ncharged with it, the mind echo of deja-vu all around it.  Searching deep\nwithin himself, he felt the autumn of his life full upon him.  He felt\nthe world he had known growing old.  He felt his own weariness, and\nagain the premonition of impending death.....  But what did the Nameless\nask of him now?  And how would he answer the man-child?\n\n'You have given me much to consider, small one.  But this decision\nmust be seasoned with time and careful thought.  Now I must rest, as you\nshould well know.  Go again to the place where I found you.  Do not\nleave it until I have summoned you with an answer.  Do you understand my\nwords?'\n\n'Yes, Monarch.  Your kindness will not soon be forgotten.' Feeling\nrelieved but still pensive, Kalus started to leave.  An upward thrust of\nthe Mantis' foreclaw stopped him.\n\n'Yes, master?'\n\n'How many summers have you known?\n\n'Twenty-one, master.'\n\n'And in what season were you born?'\n\n'In mid-winter. Why do you ask it?'\n\n'Twenty winters ago I saw a sign in the heavens and marked it well.\nI saw the light of its second full moon surrounded by a misty halo which\nseemed to reach down towards the earth.  Another, smaller halo erupted\nsuddenly, and three stars passed through it as they fell from the sky,\nall in the same direction, and each within a breath of the other.'\nNow it was Kalus who did not understand.\n\n'But how does this passing touch me?'\n\n'I think that perhaps one day you will answer that question for\nme.'\n\nThe Mantis turned and retired to his lair. Kalus stood watching for a\nmoment, then turned himself and retreated toward the shelter of the\nsmaller cave: wondering.  Akar had already passed that way before him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\nThe hours passed slowly.  Using the wood Akar had brought him, Kalus\nbuilt a small fire and they divided the cooked meat between them.\nSylviana had protested slightly, but given in when informed that\nregardless of the Mantis' decision, there could be no more free meals\nof sebreum.\n\nThere was an air of restless tension in the small enclosure.  For though\nbeing banished from the mountain did not mean certain death, it did mean\na much harder and more treacherous life.  Both Kalus and the wolf knew\njust how difficult living without a home could be; Sylviana could only\nimagine it.\n\nAkar had not forgotten that he and the girl were already welcome to\nremain there, but he kept this knowledge to himself.  His friend needed\nthe companionship of her own kind, and he had made a pact of mutual\nprotection, however tentative, with the man-child. And Akar was a\ncreature of his word.\n\nAs morning yielded gradually first to early, then to late afternoon, the\nthree had still seen or heard nothing of the mantis.  Exhausted by his\nseasonal battle with the mating spiders, he lay unmoving and death-like\nin the larger cave below them, buried in the deep, recuperative sleep of\nan insect.\n\nWith time hanging heavy around them, Kalus and the girl were given the\nchance, denied them by the turbulence of previous days, to study each\nother more closely, and to ask, if they would, the unspoken questions\nthat had been forming in their minds.  Kalus had finished with the\ncarcass by mid-day---cutting and shaping the skin, sharpening the ribs\nagainst the rock to make bone needles---but showed no sign of interest\nin talk, moving instead to look out from the entrance, apparently deep\nin thought.  Sylviana watched him there in the sunlight, with the wolf\nsleeping peacefully beside her, as she gently stroked his fur.\n\nFor the most part she studied his primitive attire, crudely made, but\nnot without a certain atavistic grace.  His primary garment consisted of\na large skin, possibly that of a buck, cut and worn like a sleeveless,\nthigh-length coat.  Worn with the fur side in, it closed in a narrowing\nV across his chest, and was bound about the waist by a band of tied\nleather.  Long slits at either hip allowed his legs their freedom of\nmovement.  Beneath one of these as he crouched could be seen a tanned\nand soft-beaten loincloth, tied off with a knot at the crest of the\nsplayed and sinewy leg closest to her.  His boots were made of some\nfurrier hide, silver-black in color, and tightly bound to his calves by\ncrisscrossing leather thongs.  He also wore thongs about his neck and\nwrists, a sharpened clamshell hanging from the former, the strands\ndangling loose in the case of the latter.  Decorative in appearance,\nthey were in fact purely practical, serving many purposes as need arose.\nHe also wore the buckskin pouch, along with a drinking skin from which\nhe rationed water for the two of them, Akar being free to pursue it as\nhe might.  As for the man himself, his hair was light brown and wild; a\nshort and irregular beard wrapped a face whose stern features implied a\ndetermination and experience beyond his years.\n\nNor had she failed to note the striking body beneath, endowed very\nprobably with more supple and functional strength than any she had ever\nseen.  More than once she felt her eyes trail across it---the knotted\narms and shoulders, the well shaped thighs and buttocks---very much\nattracted.\n\nBut it was this same strength of mind and body, infinitely desirable in\na tamer soul, that brought home so consistently her own helplessness\nagainst him.  That he could overpower her at any time was obvious, that\nhe had not yet tried to do so of little comfort.  She wondered if\nperhaps the presence of the wolf alone protected her.  And the hardest\nthing was that she did respect him.  All his actions seemed to indicate\na courageous and unselfish character.  But his morals?  She suspected\n(correctly) that he had none.\n\nBut in truth she need not have worried.  The idea of rape was so foreign\nand unnatural to his existence that the thought never occurred to him.\nAs was the way of his people, he intended first to feed and protect her,\nto establish his claim and earn her trust, and only then to take her,\nwillingly, as his mate.  And in his own mind at least, he had begun the\nprocess already.  His desire and timid affection for her bound him to\nher more closely than she knew.  At last he broke away from the entrance\nand came inside.  The wolf stirred.\n\n'It will be hard if he refuses us.  Very hard.' He sat opposite\nher against a nook in the wall and once more destroyed all\npreconception.  His face was worried and drawn, full of very human\nemotion.  Again she felt the presentiment of inescapable reality: that\nhere before her was true Man, stripped of all pretense, reduced to his\nsimplest terms.\n\nAt length he looked up at her, and seemed anxious to communicate.\nIndeed, his eyes almost pleaded for some reassurance.  She thought to\nherself, then offered a simple question.\n\n'Kalus?  What are the rest of your people like?' He shifted\npositions, drew one knee toward him, then answered.\n\n'They are no longer my people.  I am banished.....  For what they are\nlike, I don't know how to tell you.  I can only say they are not much\nlike me.'\n\n'In what way?' Finally she had something.\n\n'They act more and think less.  I think they are closer to the true\npredators than I.'\n\n'How do you mean?'\n\n'Well.  Let me think how to say it.' A pause.  'My name is\nKalus, which stands for Carnivore, or Great Hunter.  My father made it\nfor me, hoping that such a name would give me strength.  I am strong,\nSylviana, but not, I think, in the way he wanted.'\n\n'Go on.'\n\nAgain he struggled.  'I draw no pleasure from the hunt.  I don't\nunderstand.  To my people it is the proudest and most important thing\nthey do.  But to me it is often ugly, and I kill only to live.\nAlso. . there are times when I do not want to be aggressive.  Like now.\nIf the Mantis would let us stay here, I would trade that safety for all\nthe meaningless battles.....  Perhaps I am just a coward and a fool.'\n\n'No,' she said emphatically.  'You're not.' She had to\nrestrain herself from going to him then and there.  Why did his anguish\nmove her so?  'Maybe you're just better than they are.  You feel\nthings they can't.'\n\n'I do not feel better.  I thank you for saying it, but I do not think\nit is so.  Barabbas, my new father.....  It is easy for me to speak with\nyou and say I do not love the hunt.  But he must feed and protect many\nothers.  Please believe me, that is not an easy thing.' She let it go\nat that, sensing an undercurrent of anger, or something, in his words.\n\nKalus was silent for a time, lost among his thoughts.  But as the\ndaylight began to fade, he too felt the need to know something more of\nhis companion.  Largest in his mind was the question of her origin,\nsince it carried with it the one answer which truly mattered.  Could she\never be his?\n\n'Sylviana.  You say you are not from the Island.  How then did you\ncome here?  In all my years I have heard of no other tribe for many\nmiles around, surely none so fair of face and skin, that wear such\ngarments.' The girl looked down, and realized for the first time how\nodd her own clothes must seem to him: the gauze top, the worn and fading\ndenim jeans.  And her hair, somewhere between blond and brunette, with\nstreaks of both.  Silver earrings and bracelet.  But these thoughts were\nas a passing shadow on her mind.  How could she possibly tell him the\ntruth of her existence?  Somehow she had to try.\n\n'This is so hard.  A lot of it I don't know myself.' She looked\nacross at him.  'Please be patient, and let me choose my words.'\n\n'It's all right.  I am patient.'\n\nAfter several halting starts, she saw there was no other way but to tell\nhim straight out.  Let him understand or believe what he would.\n\n'A long time ago, many hundreds of years I think, there were\ninfinitely more people on earth.  Our civilization had advance so far,\nthat we could build or do almost anything.  We lived in cities as high\nas this mountain, and many times as broad, all over the world.\n\n'Unfortunately, one of the things we built the best were weapons,\ndevices to.....  Well, the argument was that they were to protect\nourselves.  But really, they had no other purpose than to kill.  Some of\nthe more primitive of these are in the Mantis' cave, though I have no\nidea how they got there.' It was useless.\n\n'We destroyed ourselves, Kalus.  I don't know how else to say it.\nI suppose there were reasons for the War, and in fairness I don't\nthink either side wanted it.  But it happened all the same.  We launched\nweapons that could kill millions of people from thousands of miles away,\nand go on killing years after.....  I don't know why I was left\nalive.' DON'T CRY.  'All my friends and family are dead.\nEverything I knew is gone.' Kalus answered softly.\n\n'Is that what the voice in the mirror was trying to tell me?'\n\n'I thought you had forgotten.'\n\n'I do not forget, Sylviana.  And I think of things more than you\nknow.  I am not one of the lesser animals.  I am only different from\nyou.'\n\n'I'm sorry.' Again she hung her head.\n\n'Don't be sorry for things that are not wrong.  You have your\nsorrows and I have mine.  Do not think of it now.  There is only one\nmore thing I must ask you.'\n\n'What is it?'\n\n'Why did you not die with the others?  And living, how have you not\ngrown old?  Is your flesh so different from mine?'\n\n'No, Kalus.  It's very much the same.' She felt weak and\ntearful, but also a strange determination to see it through.  An unusual\nemotion for her: direct rebellion against despair.\n\n'My father was a scientist, a man of learning.  Somehow he knew the\nwar was coming.  Maybe I should have known it, too, but try to\nunderstand.  My friends and I had lived with the threat of nuclear\ndestruction all our lives.  It just didn't seem real.....\n\n'My father used all the money he had saved since my mother died, to\nbuild a shelter in the Canadian Rockies.  And he was involved with\nseveral of his colleagues, other scientists like himself, in cryogenic\nresearch: a way of putting people into a deep sleep, like hibernation.\n'Just before the missiles starting falling.....  My father took me up\nin his plane.  We listened, horrified, to radio broadcasts of the\ndestruction of the cities, and of the spreading fallout.  He told me\nthat he wanted to put me into a suspended state, which would keep me\nalive until.....  Until what, I couldn't imagine.'\n\n'My mind just couldn't accept what was happening.  I was\nterrified, and told him I didn't want to leave him.  But he said it\nwas the only way.  When we landed, he said that he was sorry.  He had to\ndrug me, I guess, because the next thing I knew I was in something like\na casket with my father leaning over me, crying, and telling me he loved\nme.'\n\nShe broke down, turned against the stone wall, and wept.  Kalus looked\nat her, and but for the iron discipline he had learned, the alternative\nto which was death, would have gone to her and comforted her as best he\ncould.  As it was he felt more stirred than at any time since his\nfather's death, and quietly vowed that he would stay with her, and\nprotect her until the end.\n\nSylviana recovered somewhat, looked back at him, and seeing the confused\nsympathy of his eyes, concluded.\n\n'I woke in the Mantis' cave, with no idea where I was or how I\ncame here. I've been alone for nearly three months.  But for the\nVoice, and later, for Akar..... I nearly lost my mind with fear and\nloneliness.' She suddenly realized the wolf was no longer with them,\nand that full night was falling.  She let her thoughts collapse.\n\nKalus could not hold himself back any longer.  'You're not alone\nanymore.'\n\nHer eyes sought out his, but they were hidden among the deepening\nshadows of the nook.  With only his limbs clearly visible, he looked\nlike some phantom sage of the darkness, at once frightening and\nreassuring.  'But you must not feel it now.  Feeling is for when the\nbody is safe, and we are not.  Now you should sleep.....  I will guard\nyou.'\n\nShe moved further into the cave and lay down.  But though she tossed and\nturned for what seemed an eternity, sleep remained the distant dream of\na child.\n\n'Kalus?' No reply.  She sat up and turned back toward him.\n'You wouldn't hurt me, would you?  Please say you'd never hurt\nme.'\n\n'Of course I would not hurt you.  Why do you think I stay?' He\nadded after a time, sounding cold and irritable.  'Go to sleep and\ntrouble me no more.  I have much to think on.'\n\nNow what had she done to upset him?  Feeling more lost than ever, she\nswallowed hard and turned away.  She lay down again, and perhaps an hour\nlater, fell at last into exhausted slumber.\n\n\n*\n\n\nLong after the wolf had returned and lay sleeping beside her, Kalus\nremained wide awake, crouched at the edge of the shaft, listening.  He\nstudied the slow, deliberate breathing of the giant insect, trying to be\ncertain.  When he was as sure as he could be that the creature was still\nasleep, he began to descend.\n\nHe felt hollow as he went, partly from fear, and partly from the\nwill-crushing desperation of the act now forced upon him.  He was angry\nat having to be short with the girl, and once more felt bitterly\nabandoned and betrayed, though by whom he could not have said.  And then\ncame the voice that told him such an act was unnecessary---that he\nrisked all their lives for nothing---the cruelest lie of all.  No.  He\nknew what must be done.\n\nBut always now his thoughts returned to fear; with every step the\nfeeling grew.  By the time he reached the floor of the Mantis' cave,\nterror had completely overtaken him.  But still he went on.  He HAD to\nhave a weapon.  The Mantis might banish them that very morning, and\nwithout it they were naked and helpless.  And he knew that whatever\nprayers he might offer, to the God he did not know, no one could save\nhim now but himself.\n\n\n*\n\n\nLater that night he returned, alive but nearly paralyzed with fear.\nUnable to overcome the emotion, he went to the girl.  Touching her face\nwith the back of his trembling hand, he woke her gently.  He could no\nlonger fight back the tears as she turned to face him.\n\n'What is it?' she asked.  'What's wrong?' He tried to\ntell her what he was feeling, but it was all too much.  Rising to a sit\nbeside him, Sylviana took his face in her hands and tried to understand.\nThen she took his head tentatively to her shoulder, where he wept like a\nbrutalized child.  Feeling awkward, but very warm, she stroked his\ngnarled hair and rocked him slowly.\n\nWhen morning came it found them still anxious and afraid, but infinitely\ncloser than they had been only hours before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\nThe Mantis appeared at the entrance of his cave about an hour after\nsunrise.  Kalus and the wolf had waited by the opening of the smaller\nenclosure, and knew without being told that he was ready with an answer.\n\nSeeing them high above, Skither raised one foreclaw and summoned them to\ncome down.  As they drew closer he stepped out slowly toward the center\nof the ledge.  He wanted to choose the right words.\n\nHe exchanged simple greetings with the wolf, nodding passively at Kalus.\nHe addressed Akar first, and after several minutes the wolf nodded his\nunderstanding and moved to wait at a far corner of the ledge, without\ngiving any indication what the answer had been.  Turning his attention\nto Kalus, the Mantis signaled his words slowly and carefully.\n\n'Son of the hill-tribe, I have made my decision.  I have thought long\non your words, and on other things you do not know.  Understand, I have\ngood reason to mistrust your kinsmen.  But Akar tells me you are not\nlike them, and I accept his judgment.' He stopped for a moment,\ngenuinely moved by the man-child's countenance: the troubled face,\nexhausted by hope and fear alike.\n\n'I have decided to let you stay, young one.  But under the following\nconditions.  You will remain in the smaller cave, using my own only at\ngreatest need.  Further, you must be prepared to leave it upon my\nreturn, twenty days, perhaps more.  You may fool my enemies for a time,\nbut it is unwise to think you could hold them off longer.  I will circle\nthe mountain twice, giving credence to your sound-making device.  Beyond\nthat you are on your own. I will give Akar the rest of my thoughts.  He\nstands in my place while I am gone.  Heed him well, I do not place my\ntrust in him lightly.....  Do you hear my words?'\n\n'Yes, master. I am grateful.' He wanted badly to leave, but the\nMantis' knowing gaze would not release him.\n\n'Is there nothing else you would say to me?'\n\nKalus' heart sank.  He KNEW!  Despair overtook him at the last.\n\n'I--- I took from your cave a weapon.  Please believe me, it was not\nfor myself alone.  If you had banished us from the mountain.....  I have\nonly this knife.' He threw it weakly to the ground.\n\nSkither waited patiently, and at length Kalus looked up at him.  Again\nhe signaled slowly.  'Be at peace. I am not angry.  You may keep the\nsword, and one other weapon of your choosing.' Kalus stared in\ndisbelief.\n\n'You please me, Kalus, though you do not know it.  I see that you\nlearned long ago the lesson of self-reliance.  Now you must learn a\nharder lesson still: when to trust.  What you did this night took great\ncourage; you have not changed my mind against you.  Only.  Hear me,\nKalus, I do not give my thoughts easily.  Sometimes it is better to\ntrust, even at the price of great pain.....  Your heart will know.  But\ndo not carry the weight alone.  It will crush you.\n\n'That is all. Be at peace.' Kalus lifted the knife and moved away.\nBut as he walked stiffly toward the steep but passable incline, he felt\nlove for the Monarch swell his heart to bursting, and hard tears pushing\nat his eyes.  As he climbed to rejoin the girl, Akar went with Skither\ninto his cave to receive further instruction.  Sylviana met her new\nfriend on the parapet.\n\n'What did he say?'\n\nKalus did not answer at once, but took her by the hand and led her to\nthe one place in the enclosure where both could stand without stooping.\nReaching it he embraced her, but did not cry.  He backed away, then sat\ndown to gather his thoughts.\n\n'We can stay, until his return, at least.'\n\nShe knelt before him. 'What about the sword?'\n\n'I was right.  He did see me.  But he is not angry, and he said that\nI could keep it.  He said I was very brave.'\n\n'That's because you are.'\n\n'No.' He looked across at her sternly.  'Sylviana.  You must\nknow, this is only a beginning.  I am grateful for your compassion last\nnight, and I am in your debt.  But there is still much work to do, and\nmuch danger.  There are so many ways that the Wild can beat us.....  And\nwe must be prepared to leave here in twenty days.'\n\n'Yes. I know.' Her tone was lowered. 'But at least you're\nnot alone.' She reached out and touched his beard with the back of\nher fingers.  He moved the hand away, but without anger or secret pain.\nIt was morning still.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n'Sylviana, come here.  This is something you must see.' She went\nout and stood beside him on the parapet.  Skither was preparing to\nleave.\n\nHe stood solid with legs spread and hooked claws clinging, his abdomen\nexpanding and contracting as he prepared for the single thrust that\nwould send a massive burst of air through the small opening in his\npurposely dislocated jaw.\n\nHe let the final breath gather inside him.  Then spreading his wings for\nbalance, he exhaled in a quick and powerful motion.  The result was a\nwhistling sound so loud and shrill that it wounded the hearing even\nthrough covered ears.  All the Valley seemed to hush in its aftermath,\nan echo of silence, as if all life for miles around had stopped its\nbreath to listen.  Indeed, thought the girl, even a creature that did\nnot know the massive killer from which it emanated, would be sure to\nstay far clear of the place from which the sound had come.  The Mantis\nrested for a short time, then repeated its territorial warning.\n\nAkar returned out of the larger cave as Skither's breathing became\nnormal once more.  After several minutes he nodded imperceptibly to the\nwolf, then spread his wings and took off slowly.  He circled the\nmountain twice, swooped low down the canyon as if in anger, then turned\nwestward at the sandstone ridge and moved steadily out of sight.\nSylviana stood watching Kalus, whose eyes gleamed with some fierce\nemotion that was beyond her experience, but not her ability to feel.  He\nwas silent, lost in some world of his past, then spoke.\n\n'It will be a long time before the Commodore ventures so far from its\nhole, to steal the flesh of those yet living.'\n\nWith this he seemed to come back to himself.  He turned to the girl,\ncontented.  'There is much work to do.' He reached above and\nbehind her on the rockface to the place where he had set the pelt to\ndry.  'Have you ever worked with leather or fur?'\n\n'Yes, a little.'\n\n'Good.  Take my knife and see if you can cut four long strands from\nthe skin, each about as wide as your smallest finger.  They need not be\nstraight; they are only for binding wooden poles.  I go to the valley to\nfetch them.  Do not leave here until I return.' He began to descend,\nremembered himself.  'The sword.....' He passed her and reentered\ntheir tiny island of space, emerged with the sword, unsheathed.  Its\nwell-preserved edges looked sharp in the sunlight.\n\n'Be careful,' she said.\n\n'I am always careful.  Akar will come with me.' He took a lock of\nher hair in his fingers, and would have kissed her if he knew how.  He\nwhistled for the wolf and started down.\n\n'Kalus?' He turned.  'Won't you need an ax to cut the\nwood?' He could not hide his smile in answering.\n\n'I don't have to cut it.  I steal it from the beaver.'\n\nThe two hunters met on the broader ledge and descended into the shadows\nof the gorge, leaving the girl with only the large rabbit pelt and\nKalus' jagged knife, in truth not much improved from the museum\nrelics she had studied as a child.  She moved to a small, relatively\nsmooth stretch of stone just inside the entrance, and laid out the fur\nupon it.  She sat down and tried to work, but after several tentative\nstarts had only succeeded in shredding one corner and cutting her finger\non the knife.  There seemed no safe way to grasp it, no soft or\nunsharpened place anywhere on it.\n\n'Oh, this will never work.' She sat there on the stony ground,\nangry and frustrated, sucking her finger and cursing this backward,\nhalf-animal world.\n\nBut then an idea came to her.  She tried to suppress it, but again the\nstrange and uncharacteristic stubbornness crept over her.  She moved to\nthe dark fissure of the shaft and looked down, deliberating.  After\nseveral minutes of internal bickering, she reached her legs out over the\nside, lowered herself to the first shelf, and began to descend.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus and the wolf returned late in the afternoon.  Sylviana had not\nbeen idle.  As the man-child laid five straight and sturdy poles on the\nfloor by his accustomed sleeping place, he found there waiting for him\nfour long and curving strands, spiral cut from the skin to assure\ngreatest length and thickness.  The girl returned his questioning gaze,\nheld up a long hunting knife it its leather sheath.\n\n'If you can steal a sword, I can at least take a few things to make\nmy life more bearable.'\n\nHe looked past her on the floor to see one of the furs from her former\nbed, folded over and half filled with treasures she thought to keep.  He\nasked to see the knife.  He withdrew it from its sheath and gazed at it\nadmiringly, not at all upset.  Instead he nodded his approval.\n\n'You have done well.  He said we could take one other weapon, and I\nsee that you have chosen the best.' He gave it back to her.  'What\nare the other things?  Will he miss them?'\n\n'I don't think so.  It's just a few books, some bowls, and a\nflask for carrying water.  And this.' She pulled the fur closer,\nfished around inside it for a moment, drew out a small whet stone.\n'It's for sharpening steel.'\n\nAgain he smiled.  'You have done very well.  I will make a hunter of\nyou yet.' She put out her arms to embrace the wolf, who pulled away,\nthough gently.  Akar went again to the entrance.\n\n'How did it go with you?' she asked Kalus.\n\n'Your friend is very clever, though his heart is not in it.  He drew\naway the beavers while I took the poles.  The female---' He laughed.\n'She was so angry.  I think she would have killed me if she got the\nchance.'\n\n'Killed you?  A little two-foot long beaver?'\n\n'Two feet?' he winced.  'Perhaps the beavers of your world are\nonly that long, but I promise you, these were larger than any wolf.'\n\nShe studied him, disbelieving.  A bizarre thought had just occurred to\nher.  'Are you telling the truth?'\n\n'Why would I lie?'\n\nShe threw back the upper fold of the fur, searched among the books.  She\nquickly found what she was looking for: PREHISTORIC EARTH, ESSAYS AND\nILLUSTRATIONS.  She checked the index, thumbed the yellowed and clumping\npages.\n\nHer mind fell back into itself.  Sure enough, sketched there in relative\ndetail against the background of a large den, was the figure of a great\nprehistoric beaver, '.....eight to twelve feet in length.'\nRecovering herself, she moved hastily to sit beside him.\n\n'Do they look like this?'\n\n'Yes, more or less.'\n\nShe flipped through the stiff, distending pages---Mammals of the\nPleistocene.  She stopped at a pair of saber-toothed cats, lurking\nhungrily near a tar-pit.  'What about these?' Have you seen\nthem?'\n\n'Yes, but it is not a good likeness.'\n\nHer mind raced so that she hardly heard him.  Was it possible?  Had life\nreverted to its primitive, violent stages before Man, evolution in\nreverse?  Her scientific education told her no, it couldn't happen.\nBut was anything impossible here?  She doubted it.  She turned the pages\nagain, stopped at the illustration of a lesser species of cave-bear.\nAgain she showed him the book.\n\n'Yes, I have seen them, though they live mostly to the north and\nwest.  But it is not a good likeness.'\n\nExasperated: 'Why, Kalus?  Why isn't it a good likeness?'\n\n'Because the bear is standing---in life a bear only stands when it is\ngoing to fight---and still he is only a head taller than the tribesman.\nI tell you, the bears of the north are much larger.'\n\n'Tribesman?' In her haste she had failed to note the two fur-clad\nNeanderthals which stalked it, spear in hand, from behind a group of\nrocks.  The face of the nearer was hard and set, with swept-back\ncheekbones and heavy, prominent brow.  Eyes animal, and yet not animal.\nThe caption said something about, EARLY MAN IS BELIEVED TO HAVE\nSUCCESSFULLY HUNTED.....\n\n'No.  It can't be.' Her eyes went wide.  'Your people look\nlike this?' This time he had no reservations.\n\n'Yes.'\n\nShe sat there numb.  The realization of the truth had quite overwhelmed\nher.  Mindless, soulless animals returning to the form of their\nprimitive ancestors were one thing.  Men.....  But it was more than even\nthat.  For the first time in her life she knew, really knew, that Man\nhad once been caught in between, neither fully instinctive nor rational,\nanimal nor human, left to cross the tenuous bridge alone, and for\nthousands of years.  The intensity of their fear, and answering\ndetermination, must have been terrifying.\n\nAnd at what point did he develop a clear mind, and immortal soul?  She\nnearly wept at the thought: Man's immortal soul.  As opposed to the\nmortal, unfeeling animals.  What a sad and sorry farce.  She looked\nfirst to Kalus, then at the wolf---who stood regarding her from the\nentrance, feeling, but not understanding her pain.  She turned again to\nKalus.  One last hope.\n\n'But you don't look anything like that.'\n\n'And I don't look like my people.  It is the greatest mystery of\nmy life, and the reason they mistrust me.' She rocked herself a\nlittle, beyond the point of tears.  The man-child waited.\n\n'What is wrong?'\n\nShe found she could not answer with words, though the thoughts had come\neasily enough: too easy, like vague fears taking shape and becoming\nfamiliar from the smokes of a half-remembered past.  He seemed to sense\nthis, or something like it, and to know that whatever it was she was\nfeeling, he could not help her now.  Not yet.\n\nHe continued his work, notching the poles with hard strokes from the\nside of his stone knife, as she moved bewilderedly back to her place.\nBut often as he worked he would look over at her, stirred strangely by\nher dismay at simple truths he had long since been forced to accept.  He\nthought of this, and it puzzled him.  At length he said:\n\n'I cannot always let myself feel things.  I hope you understand that.\nPerhaps, you must feel them for me.'\n\nShe glimmered softly with marble eyes and said, 'Yes,' but her\nmind was far away.  One phrase only kept echoing inside it, gathering\ndeeper associations as it fell, like a leaf, into place.\n\nTHE LIFE OF AN ANIMAL.\n\nNight came, and they slept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\nMorning came slowly, as it will in a cave facing westward, and Sylviana\nstirred to find her companions long since wakened.  The wolf remained on\nhis guard by the door, while Kalus continued work on a spear.  He had\nlabored far into the night preparing the shaft, the narrowest and\nstraightest of the poles he had brought.  He was just fitting his stone\nknife into the etched groove at the top, to serve as a spearhead, when\nhe became aware of her.\n\n'Did you sleep well?' he asked without sarcasm.\n\n'Yes.' She rose from the fur, pushed back her hair and took a long\ndrink from the steel flask, which Kalus had filled.  She felt safe and\nrested as she brought it down again, no longer oppressed by the curving,\nserrated walls and close proximity of her friends.  A deeper, and more\nnecessary sleep she had not known for days uncounted.  'Thank\nyou.' She screwed back the cap, set down the flask and went outside.\n\nKalus held the long point in his hand, adjusted it several times in the\nslot.  When he had marked the best fitting in his mind, he withdrew it\nand placed one edge against a flat rock on the floor, then drew out his\nround hammer-stone and carefully chipped away at either side of the\nbase.  It was delicate work.  One mistake, one overzealous stroke, would\nrender it useless as a spearhead.  He did it well, refitted the point in\nthe groove.\n\nLastly he took the long strand that had dangled for weeks from his\nwrist, the hide of a buffalo, poured water over it, and wrapped it as\ntightly about the shaft as his strength and its thickness would allow.\nWhen he had done and undone this several times, he finally found the\nbest pattern, and with a grunt of exertion took the remaining length and\nforced it down between wood and stone, sealing the tie. Sylviana\nreturned with the wolf as he held it up and studied it with tired\nsatisfaction.\n\n'What will you do today?' she asked, though the spear (and her\nstomach's emptiness) should have told her.\n\n'We hunt bigger game, if the wolf is willing.  Rabbit is good for the\nshort hunger, but we need tools and clothing for the winter.....  And\nmeat.' Was there a trace of fierce lust in his voice as he said the\nword?  Or was it hers in the hearing?  She didn't like the\nimplications.\n\n'If you were going to hunt, shouldn't you have done it earlier in\nthe day?'\n\n'If I had gone out earlier, I think I would have been the hunted and\nnot the hunter. Let the big cats make their kill.  Let hyenas strip the\ncarcass.  Let them all stay contented within their boundaries and only\nthreaten to kill me.  I am patient.'\n\n'Oh.' She stood rebuked.  'When will you go?'\n\n'As soon as I am finished with this.' He took the spear to the\ncenter of the enclosure, held it firmly in his hand.  He checked it for\nbalance, found the best grips, tested the grain and strength of the wood\nby leaning it heavily against the ground.  'Good.' He faced the\nwolf.  Shall we hunt together?'\n\nAkar raised up and gestured toward the entrance.  Sylviana, on an\nimpulse:\n\n'Can I go with you?  This place is beginning to get to me.'\nSometimes it was better to confront ones fears.....\n\nHis answer surprised her.  'Yes, if you want to.  Three bodies are\nbetter than two.  But bring the knife and stay very close.  I don't\nwant to lose you.'\n\nWith the sun a hand's breadth shy of noon, they set out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\nThe company returned exhausted, with several hours of daylight and much\nwork still ahead of them.  Kalus had gutted the antelope before starting\nup the ridge, but climbing the pathless slope with such a burden had\nproven an ordeal nonetheless.  By the time they reached the ledge\noutside the Mantis' cave, he could go no further.  His legs and\nshoulders ached, threatening spasms, and the wound at the back of his\nhead throbbed with pain each time his heart beat heavily, which for the\npast two hours had been almost constantly.\n\nSetting down the kill, he looked up at the remaining distance to the\nsmaller enclosure.  He thought of Skither's instructions, but could\nonly shake his head.\n\n'We skin the carcass here,' he proclaimed, breathing heavily.\n'What the Mantis does not know, cannot trouble his sleep.' Lifting\nthe carcass one last time he brought it inside, into the relative safety\nof the larger cave.  Akar and the girl followed him in, too tired\nthemselves to protest.\n\nAkar lay down immediately in the coolest place he could find.  He had\nrun close to thirty miles that day, much of it flat out, and nursed\nemotional, as well as physical fatigue.  Neither he nor Kalus had ever\nhunted one with the other, and the experience had not been easily\nproductive.  It was true that between them they could bring down larger\ngame, but their timing together was far from perfect.  The wolf could\nnot begin to remember how many times he had circled the smaller herds,\ntrying to drive the stragglers to the place where Kalus waited with his\nspear.  The toil was frustrating and often dangerous, as this predator\nor that would react to his unorthodox, and therefore unacceptable\npresence.\n\nBut the real danger had come while stalking the plains elk.  Instead of\nbolting when he appeared, the herd leader had turned on him suddenly,\nnearly grinding him into oblivion against the side of a large boulder.\nEven now he shuddered at the sight of those enormous antlers, coming at\nhim with such startling speed and agility.\n\nHe thought then, very deep inside himself, of how easily the pack had\nhunted such game in the past, and of the honor and respect they\ncommanded.  This in turn led to burning memories of his brother, and of\nthe murdering half-breed that had brought the pack to such shame.  The\ninjustice of it all was more than his mind could accept.  It tore him up\ninside, and he couldn't get it out.\n\nHe wanted to KILL him.  He wanted to kill him.\n\nSylviana was almost in a state of shock.  If Kalus had intended to sober\nher opinion of what they were up against by exposing her directly to it,\nthen he had resorted to overkill.  Never had she felt so helpless and\nexposed as in the presence of that ever-changing panorama of landscapes\nand formidable creatures.  It was like a bad dream without waking: being\nin some monstrous zoo, and then finding that the bars of the cages had\nsuddenly disappeared. Like but unlike the prehistoric mammals she had\ndreaded, inexplicably mixed from the family of continents, they were, in\na word, overpowering.\n\nShe had not been so frightened by the large herd animals---these gave an\nair of self-satisfied indifference---as she had been by the fierce\npredators that hunted, literally, right alongside them.  Kalus had said\nnot to worry, that there was an unspoken understanding when on common\nground and in times of abundance (he had stretched the truth).  But it\nwas hard to remain calm while looking up sandstone hills at mountain\ncats seven feet long, with dark traces of mane draggled across\nimpossibly muscular shoulders.  She thought of the subtly changed\nhyenas, probably the most unnerving of all, that had swelled like a\ntooth-edged tide of hatred to the very limits of their borders, snarling\nand threatening.  And Kalus, shaking his spear in answer, and crying out\nlike an animal himself.\n\nAnd finally the kill, after so many hours. . .she tried to block it from\nher mind.  But she could not.  There it was right in front of her: Kalus\ndriving the spear deep into the antelope's shoulder as it ran past,\nthe sudden look of terror in its eyes as it fell.  Then the way he had\nripped the knife from her hand and slashed its throat without\nhesitation.  True, he had ended its suffering quickly.  But why did they\nhave to kill it at all?  And what was the point, if this world was so\nutterly wretched and cruel?  Again the questions came much too easily.\nThe answers did not.\n\nBy the time Kalus finished skinning the carcass it was nearly dark.\nThey (or rather he) then decided to cook it there as well, rather than\nrisk the long climb in darkness.  The girl halfheartedly suggested they\ntake it up through the shaft, but this too was impractical.  They built\ntheir fire near the back of the curving frontal chamber, concealing the\nflames.  Kalus made a crude spit from wood gathered earlier, and began\nthe long, slow process of cooking the meat in strands, that nothing\nwould be wasted.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAfter a time the smoke gathered above them at its height, trailing and\nwisping across the vaulted ceiling to the entrance, forming pools, or\nrising like an upward fall through the shaft.  Sylviana lay emotionless\non the bed, and watched it flow out like a river of vapor.  After what\nseemed a long time she heard Kalus' voice calling her to eat.\n'I'm not hungry,' she said.  He came and sat beside her on the\nbed.\n\n'You must eat.' She looked at him.  'I know today was very hard\nfor you.  I know you don't like to kill.....  We will try to gather\nberries and water plants tomorrow, but I cannot promise it. Please,\nSylviana.  You must try to be strong just one more time.'\n\nHer eyes finally saw him, and yet again he was not an animal, but human\nlike herself, suffering the same pain and empty confusion.  For what\nlittle that was worth.\n\n'All right.'\n\nShe got up and sat with him on the floor.  She ate from the wooden bowl\nwithout relish. But still the food gave her sustenance.  Kalus watched\nher, saddened, then rose and walked into the chamber beyond.  He\nreturned a short time later, his bowl filled with the green,\nsweet-smelling sebreum.  He placed it in front of her.\n\n'I know it's not easy for you.'\n\n'But the Mantis.'\n\n'Has a heart the same as I do.  Eat.' She regarded him weakly,\nblinked from the smoke, then lowered her head and ate.\n\nKalus returned to his cooking as the fire grew less, and after perhaps\nan hour went to sit beside her on a flat stone near the entrance.  She\nstared out into the formless darkness beyond, a fur wrapped around her\nfor warmth.  But still she shivered.  They were silent, then he spoke.\n\n'The Cold World will be coming soon.  Winter.  Already the days grow\nshort, and the evenings cool.  It is the time of year I like best.  We\nwill be safer then.'\n\n'Safer.  How?'\n\n'The herd animals travel south in search of living green, and the\npredators must follow.  We will be able to move about more freely.'\n\n'But how will we eat?' She didn't want him to stop talking.\n\n'We will eat.' Silence.  'I feel more at peace in the Cold\nWorld.  For there, if a man is strong, he can breathe the free wind\nunafraid.  Only the hardiest predators remain, and among them is\nrespect.'\n\n'What about your people?'\n\n'They will follow the herds, as they always do.'\n\n'Then how do you know what the winter is like?  Or will you go with\nthem?'\n\nA hurt, disbelieving look came over him.  'NO.' He felt\nfrustration pushing back at his own will to live.  'These past three\nWinters I have lived alone.' He looked out, and thought he might know\nwhat she was feeling.\n\n'I have known loneliness, too, though perhaps it is another kind.\nYour sorrow is for friends and ways that have died.  Mine is for\ncompanionship that I have never known.  Because to my people I am what\nthis world is to you: something beyond their experience.  And because of\nthat they fear it, and mistrust.....  I would be your friend, Sylviana,\nbut I don't always know how.' She turned, and in the shadows his\nface looked worn and grim: there was no doubting his pain.  She lowered\nher eyes to the ground.\n\n'I just don't understand,' she said, half in a whisper.  'I\ndon't understand it at all.  Why was I brought here and left to go\non?  Sometimes I think it was just to have one illusion and then another\nstripped away, till there's nothing left but the struggle to survive\nand not go crazy.  And when the last of my illusions are gone.....  What\nthen, Kalus?  What's left?' He thought for a moment, deeply, then\nraised his head and answered.\n\n'Life.' He touched his breast.  'What is here inside us.\nPerhaps that is not so much.  Or perhaps it is everything.' He turned\nto face her.  'I cannot always let myself grieve, Sylviana.  Can you\nsee that?' She nodded.  'But if you have to cry, I will try to\ncomfort you. . .as you once did for me.'\n\nShe felt a wall give way inside her.  She didn't answer, but slowly\nput her head to his chest, silently begging to be held.  And finally the\ntears came.  He held her warmly, feeling so many things.  At length she\ndrew back, and held his eyes with hers.  There was only one way out of\nthis desert.  Here and now.\n\n'Kalus.....  Will you sleep with me tonight?  Not to make love---'\nHe put a finger to her lips.  He knew what she meant.  They stayed there\nby the entrance a while longer, then went together to the bed.\n\nAkar ate solemnly, without pleasure, then returned to the isolated hell\nof his thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\n\nMorning came softly by the riverbed, with a cool northeastern breeze\nthat rustled the changing willow leaves and sent long waves of golden\nbrown across a gentle sea of grass: the Savanna.  The boy stood silent\non the northern bank at the meeting of the shallow, stony stream and the\nwider, more placid river, breathing deep the autumn air and gazing out\nover the pearling waters with a look of boundless wonder.  For his was\nthe magic of youth among the hill-people: man enough to take in more\nthan the sum of his surroundings, animal enough to feel the bliss of a\nmind free from distraction.\n\nHe had wandered far from his sleeping comrades, just as his friend the\nestranged one used to do.  He found himself thinking of Kalus now, and\nwondered vaguely, perhaps a bit sadly, if he was still alive.  Not that\nthe thought was deep or the pain acute.  But it did seem unfortunate\nthat he had to be cast out, when maybe he was not so strange after\nall. Shama missed him.\n\nHearing a twig crack behind him, he stiffened.  Whirling about, he\nsearched the sloping embankment with startled curiosity.  A lone wolf\nstood at the crest of the hill, not forty yards away.  He wondered what\nit was doing so far from its established hunting grounds.  Even as he\ndid so another head appeared, followed by a low, snaking body.  The two\ndid not move, but stood rather in ominous silence, peering down at him\nintently.\n\nBut they could not be stalking him. There was no reason.\n\nBut then an even larger wolf appeared, standing in dark majesty between\nthe others, a full head taller than either.  On closer inspection there\ncould be seen some flaw in him, some change.  The head was larger and\nthe ears wider.  The snout was shorter and a dark, bristling mane like\nthat of a horse could be seen as he lowered a haunting mask toward the\ntribesman.  Black streaks ran down from it across his haunching\nshoulders, the yellowish thrust of the upper body yielding gradually to\nthat of an unchanged wolf.  And he was strong, unnaturally strong.  His\nslitted eyes were fierce and full of hatred: Shar-hai.\n\nThe boy took first one step, and then another, upstream away from them,\ntrying not to show how helpless and afraid he really was.  He moved\nlaterally, not wanting to turn his back.  They were coming after him\nnow, gaining speed with each crouching step.  He started to run, but a\nloose clump of grassy mud gave way beneath the weight of his foot,\nsplitting his legs apart beneath him.  He fell forward stiffly, landing\nhalf in the water and half on the sandy shore.\n\nThe three were upon him in an instant.  He tried to call out for help,\nbut his terror-filled cries were too feeble to pierce the oncoming wind,\nand were carried away before they could reach his sleeping comrades,\nless than half a mile away.  He felt a sharp burst of pain at the back\nof his neck, followed by an icy numbness.  Then all sensations blurred\nand faded.  A silent blackness engulfed him, and he was no more.\n\nThe two dark wolves, the guard of Shar-hai, stepped back in bloody\ntriumph, howling their defiance to the skies.  Yet slowly the stir of\nthe kill was dispersed, and the birds in the willows sang untroubled.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nKalus had been awake for almost an hour.  He had risen to find the wolf\ngone, but gave it little thought.  Akar had his own life to live as\nwell, and he had not failed to note his companion's dark mood the\nnight before.  He could not fully reason its source, but knew that it\nmust be something fairly serious.  For the wolves were stoic and\ninfinitely survivable creatures, who rarely let emotion get the best of\nthem.  Returning from the smaller enclosure with the four poles and his\nsword, Kalus thought back to the day of his banishment, and realized for\nthe first time that Akar's gesture of submission in the\ncave---rolling over in the dirt---had not been a plea for mercy. . .but\nan act of acceptance.  An acceptance of death.  He shook his head at the\nirony, though the word meant nothing to him. He had no regrets.\n\nHe sat down on a stone inside the entrance and worked quietly and\nsteadily, peeling long strips of bark from the poles, to use along with\nthe strands of rabbit fur, to bind them together into a frame.  Sylviana\nstirred dreamily beneath the covers of her bed and he smiled, then rose\nto greet her.  Her face was to him as a flower in the desert, or a piece\nof fruit hanging from the tree when one is very, very thirsty.\n\nHis steps were checked halfway by a familiar but unsettling sound: the\nhollow wail of human breath through a conch-shell.\n\n'What was that?' asked the girl, stretching, now awake.  The sound\ncame again, faintly louder.\n\n'I must leave here,' he answered.  'One of my people is in\ntrouble.  I will return as soon as I can.'\n\n'Kalus, wait---'\n\nHe took his sword from its sheath and left the cave and bounded down the\nslope toward the ravine, then up again and on to the flat lands beyond.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAkar hesitated outside Kamela's lair, a stone-lipped hole cut into\nthe hillside.  This far his progress had gone unchecked.  His nose low\nto the ground, he searched the fern-scattered earth and outlying bramble\nfor unfamiliar scents.  He thought it unlikely that she would take\nanother mate, willingly at least, but if he were to have any real chance\nof freeing her, he had to be certain.  He found at first only the\nday-old scent of an elder female, then traces of an altered musk that\nturned the blood to poison in his veins.\n\nSuppressing inner violence, he entered the dank and root-lined swell to\nfind her lying ruefully in the dirt, nursing her one remaining cub.\nSeeing him her eyes glowed life for moment, then dulled, as if recalling\nsome bitter and irreversible truth.  She rose and stood before him,\nbrushing his ear with her snout, then stepped back and addressed him in\nthe ancient and subtle language of the wolves.\n\n'Brother of my husband,' she said quietly.  'I am heartened to\nsee that you live and flourish, but I fear that your time here is\nwasted.  Shar-hai will never allow you to take me.  He draws too much\npleasure from seeing the house of Shaezar in ruin.'\n\n'Wife of my dead brother,' he replied with equal detachment.\n'I am alive but do not flourish.  How could I live in peace with the\nchosen of my heart brought to shame?' He turned away, then gestured\ntoward the cub.  'What of the others?'\n\n'They are dead.  The half-breed has killed all males he has not taken\nto himself, or has need of now.' Bitter silence.  'Why have you\ncome?' He loved her too much.\n\n'I am going to challenge Shar-hai for leadership of the pack.  His\npride will not let him refuse me.  While his attention is drawn, you\nmust flee with the cub to Skither's cave.  It is the one place he\ndare not follow.  There you will be safe among friends.'\n\n'But he will kill you.'\n\n'Yes, or I will kill him.  Either way I cannot forsake my obligation\nto the pack, or to you.  Do not dispute me, Kamela, I stand now in my\nbrother's place.  You must be ready to leave as soon as you hear the\nsounds of our battle.  Travel as far and as fast as you can; carry the\ncub if you must.  We will not have another chance.'\n\n.. 'Very well.' Her voice was soft and without hope.  'I will\ndo as you say.  Who are the friends I am to meet?'\n\n'A woman-child and her mate.  She was brought here by Skither, and is\nlike no other.  Her companion is Kalus, of the hill-tribe.'\n\n'Such as these?'\n\n'Yes.  They are to be wholly trusted.' He broke away and went to\nthe entrance, looking worried and weary of talk.  'Where is Shar-hai?\nWhen does he return?'\n\n'He is said to be hunting with his guard near the Carak, though there\nis no shortage of food.  But that has never stopped him from killing\nbefore.' Akar felt a strange premonition as she said the words.\n\n'Why so near the hill-tribe?'\n\n'I do not know.  He has been gone since nightfall.'\n\nHe thought of Barabbas.  'So be it.'\n\n\n*\n\n\nHis legs were weary and his mind was full of doubt.  Perspiration poured\nfrom his brow to the chill of the wind, and his head and lungs ached\nfrom the exertion.  But he ran on.  Nearing the joining of rivers he saw\nhis younger brother standing on the far side with the conch-shell\nraised, still summoning wildly.  He began to wade the shallows, his\nsword raised above him. He saw that his brother was crying.  The current\nwelled up around his neck.\n\nThen he saw the body.  He fought back a strangling burst of sorrow that\nin those waters might well have killed him.\n\nHis brother had seen him. Fighting the current, Kalus again found his\nfooting among the northern shallows, then waded in stubbornly.  He\ndropped his sword on the bank and went to the body of Shama, still half\nin the water, and lifted and carried it gently to the root-covered\nground beneath a willow. Setting it down as he would his own child to\nsleep, he stood back.  He could not escape the pain.  His face was wet,\nand he turned to face his brother.\n\n'Who did this thing?' he demanded, with uncontrolled violence in\nhis hands and in his heart.  His brother felt the same emotion.\n\n'The wolves who you protect.' He was not awed by the sword, or by\nage.\n\n'Be silent or I will kill you!' flashed Kalus' hands.  'You\nknow Akar would not do this.  WHAT wolves!'\n\n'The Changed One and his guard.  I saw them taste Shama's blood\nwhile he yet lived.....  Barabbas has gone to find the others.'\n\n'But why was Shama so far from the cave?' He wept outright.\n'Why was he here alone?'\n\nAt last Komai looked into his eyes, and realized again his brother's\nlimitless capacity for pain.  'I do not know, Kalus.  We made a\nhunting camp not far from here.  Shama wandered away from it while we\nslept.....  You must go, brother.  If Barabbas finds you here he will\nkill you.'\n\nKalus took his brother's hand in his and pressed it to his heart.\n'I go to the northern hills.  I will kill the half-breed if I can.\nGoodbye.' There was nothing more.  He set out.\n\nHe made for the north, and so great was his anger and purpose that all\ncreatures who saw him let him pass unchallenged.  He was only dimly\naware that two tribesman, one very large and strong, had passed him to\nthe west, moving toward the place where Komai stood in lonely vigil.  He\ndid not care.\n\nBut as he walked his heart-sickness and rage yielded slowly, reluctantly\nto reason.  He was not swayed in his resolve to kill Shar-hai---who\nmight next come stalking one yet dearer---nor spared any measure of the\nbludgeoning sorrow and guilt.  But with each mile he thought more of\nher, and of their indescribable communion the night before.  And as the\nland became more broken and the granite-boned hills a nearer mark, he\nfound more and more than he wanted to live, a desire that chafed against\nhis hatred, and crossed his will to act.  He whirled the sword in blind\nfury about him, but could not make the conflict go away.  He had never\nbeen needed before.\n\nHe walked, now passing the mesa that had once, in what seemed another\nworld, been his home.  And he thought, and tried to think, what must be\ndone.  WHAT MUST BE DONE.  And how to do it.\n\nWhere was Akar?  How long before Barabbas would follow?  Surely in this\nthey were not enemies.  Which path would the Changed One follow?  Surely\nhe feared the hill-tribe, and would not pass directly in front of their\ncave.  He was grateful that his head no longer ached and his breath came\neasier.  He thought of his mother.  SYLVIANA.\n\nSuch ran the jumble of his thoughts, and the feelings which rose all the\nstronger for his efforts to control them.\n\nThe wolves, he decided, must have passed on the far side of Carak mesa.\nThe would follow a small, tree-blinded stream to the hills.  The Hill.\nThere could only be one.  I DON'T WANT TO DIE.\n\n'Sylviana.'\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus sat crouched and still among the twisted bramble that grew,\novershadowed by oak and maple, at the base of the hill.  He had reached\nthe narrow vale first and seen them coming, as he thought, from the\nwest.  He had positioned himself uphill, and downwind of the gentle fold\nthrough which they must pass, betting his life on the skills he had\nlearned as a boy.\n\nThey turned the bend and came closer, scenting the wind.  And as he\nwatched, the man-child was struck, and weakened in will, by the size and\nunswerving gait of Shar-hai, whom he had seen before only from a\ndistance.  Now he was less than a hundred yards away.\n\nSuddenly the great head stopped in mid-air, turning left and then right:\nsearching.  At the same moment his guard lowered their noses to the\nground and angrily, anxiously swept the earth about them.  Kalus'\nheart froze, but even as it did his fingers wrapped more tightly about\nthe hilt of his sword.  The two fanned out fifteen yards to either side,\nthen doubled back upon their own path.  It was not his scent they had\nfound.\n\nThey snarled and tore the ground with their feet, waiting to\nadvance. For the scent of the true wolf they recognized, and hated.\nOnly Shar-hai looked about him, sensing, but not seeing, something else.\nHe too was aware of Akar.  His lip curled slightly and a rumble of\ndistant hatred crawled out.\n\nThey advanced up the hill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13\n\n\nThe sky was deep and blue and bare of clouds.  The sun shone down bright\nand unhindered, but its warmth was fleeting, carried away by the\nfretting and inconstant late October wind.  Dry and fallen leaves were\nwhisked up quickly into whirlwinds, only to be abandoned with equal\nsuddenness, left to drift back to earth as they would.  The aged and\nwind swept granite thrusts bore countless lichen edged crevices, filled\nwith the same brown and lifeless needles that covered the ground\nwherever rock or pine, or holly did not.  The air was cool and clear,\nbut altogether void of fragrance.\n\nThe meeting place had been well chosen.  A wide and shallow bowl at the\nvery crown of the Hill, carved by nature from the rock that formed its\nbones, it commanded an unobstructed view for miles in all directions.\nBeyond the reach of all but the hardiest pines, it lay bare and open to\nthe sky above.  Here sun by day and star by night were free both to see\nand be seen by the descendants of a race as old as conscious thought\nupon the Earth.\n\nIt is a fitting place to die, thought Akar solemnly.  He rested now upon\nthe southern promontory which stood out from the edge of the bowl like\nthe horn of a saddle, waiting for his foe to reappear from the cover of\noverhanging branches into which he had vanished from view.  By now he\nmust surely be aware of his presence.  But he knew Shar-hai would do\nnothing in haste.\n\nSo arching his head skyward like the wolves of old, he let out a long,\ndispassionate howl, issuing his challenge to whatever ears might choose\nto hear it.  He felt new strength and courage coming to him from out of\nthe Hill, from the roots of stone and past, and he vowed again not to\nsurrender his spirit until every chance to kill or injure the usurper\nhad been utterly spent.\n\nNow less than two hundred yards away on the slope below, the guard\nresponded with angry growls and defiance.  For they still detected only\none forbidden scent.  Only Shar-hai showed restraint, held back by the\nmeasured caution of one who had lived his life in subtle but constant\nfear of retribution.\n\nNot that he feared Akar's challenge.  He had no intention of abiding\nby any rules or code of honor in dealing with his brave but foolish\nopponent.  He knew that if at any point he faltered, his guard would not\nhesitate to join the fray.\n\nBut still he was uneasy.  He had slept poorly two nights before, and\ntrembled in the shadows of a dark vision.\n\nIn his dreams---he had not slept again since---he walked through a bleak\nforest of eternal night, the black trunks of the trees gnarled and\ntwisted like misshapen statues, wrapped about the feet with a chill mist\nthat rose to a fog and blanketed the horizons, giving all distance a\nfeeling of timelessness and endlessness.\n\nHe walked alone, feeling lost: hungry, no matter how many times he\nkilled.  He stalked and slew first one beast and then another, with none\nto rise up against him, and none to mourn the loss of the fallen.\n\nAnd finally, after an endless, meaningless search, he thought he had\nfound it, the thing he hungered for.  A child, white and innocent and\nsoft.  It had fled before him on sight, flying first down, and then up,\na long bare hill.  He pursued it in ecstasy, in torment.  Closer and\ncloser, his body growing weaker, almost sexually, his legs sometimes\nmoving in place, as his desire became more desperate.  He was almost\nupon it when---\n\nA terrible Angel of Death stood before him, wrapped in a cold and deadly\nlight, a flaming blue weapon in its hands.  He tried to stop, but\nsomething pushed him forward, irresistible: driven like a piece of meat\nonto the stake.  He cried out in a voice that was almost human.....\n\nUpon waking he had heard yet again the hoarse words of the hyena bitch\nwho bore him, as she lay dying, abandoned, in the snow.\n\n'Wreak your vengeance well, son of Shar, and fear not the wrath of\nyour brothers.  For no creature of the wild shall ever slay you.\nNeither river, nor mountain, nor lion; but only a man.  Beware the dark\nmasters who walk erect, with the eyes that burn of a world that will\nnever be.....' And he had raised his head in spite of himself, alone\nin the night, and howled his anguish to the wind.\n\nBut here, now, there was Akar to deal with.  It all seemed so pointless.\nFor try as he might, he could not make his hatred flare against him as\nit had against Shaezar.  They were much alike.  But yes, he would kill\nhim.  And kill again, until the emptiness of his soul had been sated, or\nhad itself been devoured.\n\nHe emerged with his guard into the clearing that stood before the\nsouthern rise of the promontory.  There he was met by the remaining\nmales of Shaezar's pack.  There were only four: an aging outrider,\ntwo yearlings and a one-eyed five year old.\n\nSeeing Akar standing straight and proud above them, the four were faced\nwith a difficult choice.  If there had been but one more seasoned male\namong them, perhaps they could fight.  But as it was they stood no real\nchance against the monstrous half-breed and his treacherous companions,\nthemselves both large and fierce.\n\nAkar looked down on them with compassion, for their dilemma had been his\nbefore them: whether to serve a hated leader, or to make noble but vain\nrebellion against him.  The hackles of the guard were raised, and there\nwas scarcely contained rage in their throats.  Shar-hai addressed the\nwolf.\n\n'You have issued your challenge, small one.  Will you remain there\nabove us, or come and meet your death in the arena?'\n\n'We will do battle soon enough, my unnatural brother.  But first I\nwill speak to those whose souls remain.' And there was in his voice\nsomething so solemn that it stilled the fires of the two, and granted\nhim with Shar-hai this last request.  He spoke in a dialect they only\nhalf understood.\n\n'Do not despair, you that remain.  Even if this battle is lost, the\nmarauder cannot last much longer.  He defies all that is quietly strong\nwith every step he takes.  Nature will not allow it.  His death draws\nnear.'\n\nWith that he turned, and leapt down into the arena behind.  Shar-hai was\nthere ahead of him.  And for all their snarling threats and lunges, his\nguard could not keep the others from pushing past and up the curving\nstone trench that led into the meeting place.  One female joined them\nthere as well.\n\nAkar fought valiantly, summoning all the courage born of despair, and\nall the strength and guile he could muster.  He fought in the only way\nhe could---refusing to allow Shar-hai to use his greater size and\nstrength to advantage.  Each time the two would bolt together, rising\nfrom impact with heads writhing and bared teeth crashing, he would slide\noff quickly and not be broken back, slashing as he did at the flanks of\nthe other before retreating.  In this way he bought time for Kamela,\nholding off the death clash as long as he could.\n\nBut soon, as he knew he would, Akar began to tire.  His lunges at the\nlegs and ribs of his opponent had done little damage, while the constant\npounding on his own neck and chest had begun to take its toll.  Rising\ntogether yet again he remained there, suspended, and aimed for the\nthroat.  He could not get past the others flashing jaws, then was broken\nback.\n\nThey clashed again, Akar off balance, and it was only through a supreme\neffort that he held up against the weight and strength.  He slipped\naway, and this time Shar-hai lunged at his exposed shoulder.  The wolf\nturned sharply back into him, trying to seize his front leg; but he was\naway.  Akar ran a short way, then turned.  They rose together, the\nlarger reaching greater height, forcing him down.  He slipped away.\nAgain.  One of the guard suddenly lunged at him, biting deep into his\nhind leg before the one-eyed male drove him away.  They bickered and\nfought.  Shar-hai was on him again, tearing at his ear.  They rose.\nAgain.\n\nSlowly they kept fighting and Akar was losing strength and it seemed to\nhim that the world became a blur of yellow teeth and he was caught in a\ncircle of foes whose names he had forgotten, and it was like a dizzying\nwhirlpool or being caught in a ring of fire with the heat and smoke\nchoking him and all he could do was fight back against the one who kept\nattacking him.\n\nAnd as the horror of it grew and desperation drove reason and\nconsciousness from him, he became cruel and savage like a dying animal.\nAnd for a time this desperation gave him strength.  But soon he knew\nthat this growling bitter hatred that was the fire beneath living\ncreatures and which he was feeling only now, was second Nature to\nShar-hai, and what he would be feeling very soon now that he was cut and\nin the midst of insurrection.  And it was true.  Perhaps only seven\nminutes had passed before Akar had nothing left and his foe was still\nstrong.  So hideously strong.\n\nThe knowledge of Death came to strangely to Akar, as his spirit weakened\nand he knew the end was near.  And it was familiar, so familiar.  It\nfilled him with a dull horror that was the essence of all the nightmares\nhe had tried to forget.  He knew he would die, and if there had been\ntime it would have filled him with a great sorrow.  But there was no\ntime.  And he was ready to quit when he remembered Kamela, and knew that\nhe must fight a while longer.\n\nThen sensing his weakness, Shar-hai reached a foreleg across him as they\nrose, and with all his weight and strength crushed him to the ground\nagainst a jutting stone.  Akar gave a short yelp of pain as he landed\nand something in his shoulder gave way.  And he knew he could rise no\nmore.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus had heard the sounding of the challenge, but it meant nothing to\nhim.  He kept looking back toward the lower lands and wondering.  But\nwhen he heard the sounds of battle, and saw the female running past with\nthe cub but looking back many times, he understood.\n\n'Akar!' he thought dismally, pounding his head in anger and\nself-loathing.  'Why didn't I know it before?'\n\nIt all came to him in an instant: the outcast wolf, the murderous\nusurper, Akar's underlying despair.  And he knew and felt a quiet\ndread creep over him.  Because he could not wait.\n\nHe ran now, all hiding behind him, up the hill toward the place where he\nknew Akar was fighting for his life, and for the life of the female he\nloved.  He thought of Sylviana and nearly stopped---he looked\nback---then continued up the hill with the sword in his hand.  His\npledge, and the threat of a dangerous enemy left unchallenged, drove him\non.\n\nAfter a time he tried to pace himself, knowing he would have nothing\nleft. But still he pushed as hard as he dared.  He reached the clearing,\nnow unguarded, and looked up at the promontory.  He could not rush in\nblind, with the battle so close, but must have some advantage at least.\nSo he moved to a place where the rock was scarred and began to climb,\nthat he would not be wholly without protection.\n\nBut his limbs trembled as he went, and when he reached the top he went\nto the edge overlooking the arena and cried out his rage and fear in a\nvoice that was more like a roar than something human.\n\n\n*\n\n\nShar-hai turned from where he hovered over the fallen wolf, and looked\nup.\n\nHis heart froze.  For there above him, framed and distorted by the sun,\nstood the apparition of all vengeance: the Angel of Death from his\ndream.  He stepped back and away, and for the space of three breaths,\nhad neither strength nor control of his limbs.\n\nBut Shar-hai had not lived so long against the apparent will of Nature\nby being timid or a fool.  He moved out from the path of the sun, and\nsaw not a fiery angel, but a man---young and fierce and desperate, but\nstill only a man---who bled the same blood, and could also be killed.\n\nKalus leapt down into the circle.  The guard would have gone after him,\nbut they could not.  The aged male and the one-eye stood before them,\nthreatening, with the others not far behind.  They felt no love or\nallegiance for any man, but this one protected their fallen leader.  And\nthey knew not whether they did something brave or foolish, but only that\nthe moment was too much and they must do it.\n\nShar-hai began to circle, and to try to understand the strange weapon,\nwhile Kalus felt his heart pounding and the sweat from his palms making\nhis grip clammy and the sword hard to hold.  Finally the waiting and\nfear became too much and he rushed at him, slicing the air with the\nblade.  But Shar-hai slipped away easily and circled behind him before\nhe could turn.\n\nKalus whirled to face him.  Wielding his weapon with courage but little\nreal skill, he repeated the attack again and again.  Fruitless.  The\nweight of the sword was too much and his grip seemed feeble, and his\nlegs still trembled from the weakness of the climb; and his foe would\nnot remain stationary, or venture within the cutting sweep of his sword.\n\nBut he was strong and determined, and confronted by death and he knew\nit.  He kept the half-breed in front of him, breathed slowly and deeply\nand shook with bitter rage as he clenched his teeth and moved forward\nagain.  He swept the blade in a flat, circular motion.  But again he\nmissed, and the guard drew closer, snarling and lunging.  He felt sweat\ncome over him, and the cold chill of knowing he had stepped too far.\nAnd for all his years of learning he could not contain the frightened\nrage that sent him chasing and cutting in wild circles and angles while\nthe half-breed leapt aside, rushing in short bursts and avoiding the\nblade, with the hatred of his eyes burning ever deeper.\n\nThen Kalus felt the presence of Death like a grim truth, or a sinister\nshadow eclipsing his soul, till all he could feel was a raw, animal\nterror.  And finally in his desperation he missed badly and slipped down\non one knee, and Shar-hai rushed in and tore at the back of his calf\nbefore he could whirl the sword's hilt, with his elbows hooked, and\nstrike him feebly and too far in the arc of the swing across the jaw.\nAnd still Shar-hai was nearly upon him before he could thrust the weapon\nbetween them, holding the top of the blade with his other hand which now\nbled with a sharp pain.  And as the wolf stepped back and began to turn,\nthe tortured muscles at the back of his leg made it hard to stand.\n\nBut he knew he must stand, and he still had a little courage left.  So\nhe rose and faced his foe, who was through with running, and tried to\naim a blow at his head; but his hands would not stop shaking.  So he\nmade one last swoop and ran in the direction it carried him, and for all\nhis shame at leaving Akar his one thought was to break free of the\ncircle and run, so hard and so far.....\n\nBut Shar-hai rushed up behind him, and his teeth found their mark in the\nsoft flesh and tendon at the back of his knee.  Kalus reeled and fell\nforward, the sword flying from his grasp.  And he knew it was the end.\nHe covered his head with his hands and cried out, and waited for the\nrush of tearing, yellow teeth.\n\n\n*\n\n\nShar-hai stood for a moment catching his breath, stood glowering over\nthe man-child whose weapon he had truly feared.  Not for nothing had the\nhyena bitch warned him of men.  This death he would not savor.  It must\nbe swift and final.\n\nHe thought he heard a rustle behind him, and one of his guard spoke in\nalarm.  He turned his head as the point of a spear, wielded without\npassion but with skill and fell purpose, split his shoulders precisely\nand buried itself in his heart.\n\n\n*\n\n\nTrembling with fear, Kalus opened his eyes slowly.  Why had Shar-hai not\nfinished him?  Why was he still alive?\n\nThe first thing he saw was the body of his foe, large even in death,\nlying on its side, the shaft deeply embedded.  But the next thing he saw\npuzzled him still more, was yet stranger.  He saw the hunched and\ngrizzled form of Barabbas standing not five yards away, looking at him\nwith tears as large as droplets running down his cheeks.  In all his\nyears, Kalus had never seen him cry.  But that was not quite true.\n\nSomething in the nerve-heightened sense of the moment, and in the strong\nman's broken expression, brought home with sudden clarity the memory\nof a day that lay buried among the horrors of a past he had tried to\nforget.  The day of his father's death.\n\nIt had been less than seven years.  In the midst of a scourge of\nspiders, hunger and scarcity of game had forced the tribe far to the\nwest, beyond any boundaries or even point of recognition.  After a long\nand fruitless day's search, the men at last spotted three large deer,\nfeeding in a clearing on a long hillside surrounded by trees.  They had\nbroken into groups, to circle and surprise them.  His father and his\nbrother, still a boy, had gone alone to the far left-hand side where the\nclearing ran through a sunken gap, to cut off that way of escape.\n\nBut as they drew nearer the prey, from their respective paths the others\nhad heard the sounds of sudden, deep growling and forgotten the deer,\nwho scattered as they left cover and came running to the place where his\nfather was being mauled and dragged by a bear, also far from its home,\nwith his brother stabbing futilely with his tiny spear and crying and\nscreaming as his father made no sound.  And the men had killed it in a\nfierce battle, but his father lay bloodied and unmoving.\n\nBarabbas had stood for a long time---alone, shaken but not from\nfear---then had taken the two of them aside.  His heavy hands said\nsimply, 'I am your father now.' He had turned to walk away, then\nturned again and said.  'I am sorry.' A sob made him breathe\nheavily and drop his head: a single tear.  And that was the only emotion\nhe had allowed himself to feel.\n\nNow, as Kalus watched him, it was as if a veil had been lifted and he\nsaw him for the first time, not as the hard and untouchable leader, but\nas a man---real, and therefore vulnerable.  And he remembered other\nthings as well.  All the times Barabbas had gone hungry so that others\ncould eat, the way he always stood foremost in times of danger, risking\nhis own life to defend them.  He felt his pain.  And he found himself\nfighting back tears as he rose.\n\n'Why are you crying?' he said feebly.  Then remembering, he\nsignaled with his hands.  'Why?'\n\nAnd Barabbas misunderstood, as the wolves and tribesmen stood in silent\ntruce around them, the guard deserted, and he thought Kalus asked.\n'Why did you not let him kill me?' This was too much for him.  He\nclenched his hands around nothing and bowed his head, and felt as if he\nstood at the center of a vast desert where nothing and no one could\ntouch him and all he could do was fight and not win.\n\n'How could I?' he signaled clumsily, ashamed.  His large eyes and\nmatted hair faced downward, then looked up again, almost pleading.\n'I killed him because you are my flesh.  You are my son; I will never\nhave a son.  Because I cannot breathe or sleep when I think you are\nalone and in danger, and I know it is my fault.\n\n'I was afraid Carnivore; I am often afraid.  I also knew of this\nkiller.' He moved a hand toward the ground, toward the still figure\nof the marauder who had ended Shama's life.  'When I saw the wolf\namong us in the cave, I forgot all reasons.....  But I should not want\nto kill Akar.  I should not reward your courage with banishment.  I am\nsorry, Carnivore.  I am sorry.  I grow old, and afraid of dying.' And\nhe covered his face with his hands.\n\nAnd Kalus wept, because he felt the same emptiness.  He wept for\nweakness and fighting and death, and feeling so much.  And he went to\nBarabbas and took down his hands, and awkwardly embraced him.  And\nBarabbas did not know what to do, but only that he loved his son who was\ncrying, and that he was not alone anymore.  His own tears still fell,\nbut now for love, and he felt the great emptiness filling slowly, and\nall the while Kalus said strange words.\n\n'Forgive me.'\n\nThen Kalus backed away, drained of all emotion, and went to see if Akar\nwas all right.  Then he turned back to his father, still feeling though\nhe had nothing left.\n\n'We are allies,' he signaled.  'I will always fight for you.  I\nlove you, my father, you are stronger than I.  Do not be ashamed.'\nAnd Barabbas no longer felt old and foolish, and as he turned to face\nthe others, felt no shame.  They stood silent, as the wolves stood\nsilent, and Kalus knelt beside him friend, forgetting his own injuries.\n\nAkar tried to raise himself off the damaged shoulder but could not.  He\nslid down in anguish.  And Kalus lifted him and laid him on his\nundamaged side, then felt the shoulder gingerly for broken bones.\n\nFinding none he turned to Komai, and one other, and asked them to help\nhim make a stretcher.  His brother was the first to come and kneel\nbeside him, laying down his spear and taking off a heavy fur he wore\nwrapped about his shoulders.  Another offered his spear, and they\nwrapped the fur carefully around the two shafts.  Barabbas watched them\nquietly and smiled, though not on the outside, as Kalus signaled to his\nbrother.\n\n'Help me take him to the Mantis' cave.'\n\nThe two of them lifted the stretcher, and began to walk toward the stone\nchannel to descend.  Akar was still in great torment of mind and body,\nand it was all he could do to raise his head to the pack, which he must\nnow rule, and tell them:\n\n'You must go to the South alone.  I will follow when I can.  Be\ncautious, hunt together, and hold fast to hope.' And Kalus, limping\nbut proud to walk, with his brother behind him carried the stretcher\ndown the hill.\n\nThe others followed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nThe Cold World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao The name that can be\nnamed is not the eternal name The nameless is the beginning of heaven\nand earth The named is the mother of ten-thousand things.\n\nEver desireless one can see the mystery Ever desiring one can see the\nmanifestations.  These two spring from the same source but appear as\nopposites And this seems to us darkness\n\nDarkness within darkness The gateway to all mystery\n\n---Lao Tsu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\n\nThe first snows of December fell gently, blanketing the valley in a thin\nveil of white and quiet stillness.  With most of the larger beasts gone,\nand others soon to follow, it was a time for the lesser creatures of the\nvales to once again show themselves and become a part of the living\nworld.  For at last the change had come, and the dangers grown less.\nThe weather was mild and predictable.  The cold was not yet piercing.\n\nIt was a time when young foxes, weary of caution and hiding, were free\nto forage among the brakes and hedges unafraid, leaving behind them tiny\ncraters in the snow.  Northern rabbits, now splotching white through\ntheir seasonal brown, could also be seen moving easily through the\ntree-ringed meadows, stuffing themselves to soft roundness in\npreparation for the cold and hungry days ahead.  Only the sounds of\nlate-migrating geese disturbed the stillness, passing over but not\ntouching the thousand microcosms below, alone unto themselves.\n\nIt was but a brief respite.  And through all their simple and wordless\njoys of freedom, the creatures that remained knew it must be used as a\ntime of preparation---that the Cold World would soon be upon them.\nKalus spent the gradually shortening days in tentative hope and\nlingering doubt, and wondered at the growing emotions inside him,\nbrought alive and set in inevitable conflict, he imagined, by the girl.\nHe had never felt life so close around him, and the feelings it brought\nwere not without their measure of apprehension and uncertainty.  So he\ncut and gathered wood, made and refined tools, smoked meat and packed it\nwith wild salt in the depths of niches and fissures he had discovered in\nthe mountainside above them.  Then covered the hiding places with\nstones.\n\nEvery pelt, no matter how small, was saved and turned into winter\nclothing by the girl, who seemed to be more adept at such things than\nhe.  Sometimes Kamela would hunt with him, to help provide for the\nwolves, but always with a dull and hopeless look in her eyes that Kalus\nfelt very deep in his heart.  The long scar on her underside, which he\nhad seen only once, while she slept, could tell him only a part of the\ntale.  And of the rest she was closed even with Akar.\n\nBut most of all he thought of Skither, and wondered when he would\nreturn.\n\n\n***\n\n\nSylviana lay propped on her elbows, her favorite fur half in and half\nout of the entrance of the smaller cave, looking down on the snow-dusted\ngrasses with misting and faraway eyes.  Her mood triggered by the scene,\nshe was thinking of the fragile water domes she had toyed with as a\nchild, all alone in the unused bedroom of her grandmother's\nhouse. Christmas.  Her mind conjured the room before her: the massive\nfour-posted bed, the mahogany dresser crowned with photographs of aunts\nand uncles, the lace-curtained and frosting windows.  And she remembered\none in particular, a Nativity scene, her favorite.  She remembered the\nway the tiny flakes would sift softly through the water and onto the\nroof of the manger, only to be swept away again as she lifted the glass\ndome and shook it.  The water would swirl like a sudden wind, then the\nflakes settle slowly.....\n\nShe was aware of movement on the plains below.  Her eyes focused, and\nshe saw Kalus walking back towards the mountain through the snow-covered\ngrasses, turning his head from side to side, watching.  Though he would\nnever admit it, she knew he was worried over Skither's extended\nabsence, and about its bearing on their safety and their future.  He\nstood at the edge of the gorge, looked up at her, then descended the\nsteep half-path of stone and was swallowed up in shadow.  Her mind\nreturned fully to the present.\n\nThey had moved to the smaller enclosure as soon as Akar was able,\nexpecting to be there only a short time; but the Mantis had not\nreturned.  Nearly six weeks had passed since his departure, and the\ngirl, at least, had begun to think he never would.  But if ever she\nmentioned the possibility to Kalus, he grew sullen and cold; and she had\ndecided at length to put the thought from her mind, and let Nature run\nits course.  Still, she couldn't help wondering how it would be if\nthe larger cave were truly theirs.  She had grown very fond of, or at\nleast accustomed to, the safety of the \u0091mountain'---their word for\nthe higher, tooth-shaped rise in the ridge of granite cliffs---and\nleaving it now for the uncertainty that lay beyond was not a thought she\nrelished.\n\nKalus made his way up the slope to the Mantis' ledge, paused for\nbreath, then continued.  Climbing ever closer up the path, he smiled at\nher with half his face, and reaching the parapet, passed by her and went\ninside.  The pup, roused from its attentions to a small bone, wagged its\ntail and ran to greet him as always.  Akar sat up gingerly on his two\nfurs near the back of the enclosure.  Kamela was off somewhere alone.\nThe girl rose after a time, ducked her head and followed him in.\n\nHe sat cross-legged on the floor with the pup in his lap, thinking.  She\nknew that look. Something (more than the ordinary) was troubling him.\nAfter a short silence she asked simply.\n\n'What's wrong?'\n\n'Skither should have been back by now.  The weather is growing too\ncold, and still he doesn't come.' Sylviana said nothing.  He\nlooked at her.  'I know.  I feel it too.  This place is too small for\nso many to live.  If he doesn't return soon I will try to find us\nanother place.' She hesitated.  'What about the lower cave?'\n\n'Perhaps. But not yet.' He set down the wolf pup and drew his legs\ntogether with his arms, sat gnawing at his knees and looking worried.\n\nThe girl moved behind him and began to massage his neck and shoulders.\nHe reached up a hand as if make her stop, but instead took her by the\nwrist and turned to face her.  His deep blue eyes studied her with an\nunreadable expression.  Dropping to one knee in the way now familiar,\nshe stroked his open forearm tentatively.\n\n'Are you angry with me?'\n\n'No.' He shook his head, kissed the back of her hand.  He drew\nback into his former attitude and remained silent for a time,\noccasionally rocking himself and staring at the floor.  Finally, as with\ngreat effort, he said the words.\n\n'I'm confused.'\n\n'About what?'\n\n'The Mantis.  And you.'\n\n'Why me?'\n\n'You make the world so much closer.  I can't run, or close my mind\nanymore.  Almost, I can't hide from the questions.....  I can't\nspeak of it now. Not yet.'\n\nSylviana knew he would say nothing more.  Again she stroked his arm,\nfelt his hand encircle her wrist, then rose to prepare a meal.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThat night as they lay together among the furs that made their bed,\nKalus moved close beside her and buried his head against her chest.\nThough they had slept together many times, he had not yet tried to make\nlove to her.  In his instinctive way he sensed she was not ready, and in\nfact this voice inside him was correct.  He still, in part, represented\nto her the harsh world from which he came, a world she was not ready to\nfully accept, or give herself up to.  But this was not what held him\nback now.  A fear that he could not understand---the fear of losing the\nthings he had found---haunted him now as it had for weeks, seeming to\nintensify with each passing day.\n\nSylviana stroked his hair, now smooth, and felt him warm against her.\nThey lay thus for several minutes, until she realized he was crying.\nShe took his face in her hands, not understanding.\n\n'I'm sorry,' he said quietly, shaking his head and clearing his\neyes.  'I didn't mean to frighten you.' She took a deep breath\nand rolled onto her back in frustration.  But still the warmth that was\nin her made her reach out and touch his face, his neck.\n\n'The only thing that frightens me is not knowing what you're\nfeeling.  You never tell me.  You keep it all inside.  I know it hurts,\nKalus, a lot.  But you have to try.  I'm not going to judge you, or\nthink you're weak.....  I care for you very much.  In my way. . .I\nlove you.' Kalus gripped the edge of the fur and curled it tightly in\nhis hand, as if needing to use his body over mind.  The night was quiet\nand still around them.\n\n'I don't know what we'll do if he doesn't come back.'\n\n'Well, what are our choices?' She truly wanted to know, and she\nthought it might give him something concrete to discuss.  She knew, or\nthought she knew, he didn't deal well with abstractions.\n\nAs he spoke the words, Kalus felt reluctance giving way.  Almost it came\nas a relief to let go.  And as he spoke it took his mind from the place\nthey were, and into something like a dream, however real, that gave him\nsome escape from himself.  Though his worry was not abated.\n\n'I've thought about returning to Carak Mesa, where my people live\nin warmer weather.  There are several caves, joined by short\npassageways, and one chamber that is large enough for all of us.  It is\ndry, and gives some protection against the wind.\n\n'But it is too hard to defend,' he continued.  'Even with a man\nguarding each entrance, we had to keep our fires burning brightly and\nour weapons close at hand.  Barabbas held it more through intimidation\nthan anything.  Perhaps we could block all but one entrance.  But the\nrock is like hard white earth filled with pebbles---'\n\n'Limestone,' interjected the girl.\n\n'Yes, and not always firm to brace wooden poles and stones\nacross.' His gaze returned from the low roof.  'Do you want to\nhere this?'\n\n'Yes, very much.' Even this brief scenario had given a clearer\npicture of his life among the hill-people than all the shy, abbreviated\naccounts which had come before it.\n\n'There are other caves, along the ridge farther north.  But they are\nnot large, and too close to the bottom of the gorge.  I don't like to\nthink that other creatures could crawl down on me: being below the level\nof the land.  Then there are the earth-holes dug by the wolves in the\nNorthern Hills.  With Akar ---the pack has gone to the South, as I told\nyou---it would be all right for us to live there until Spring, perhaps\nlonger.\n\n'But there also, there are too many unknowns.  The great bears come\nfarther south in Winter, crossing the Broad River far to the west, where\nit is shallower and stony.  Their violence, when enraged, is like no\nother creature.  My father was killed by such a bear. . .and the thought\nof finding you, dragged out across a hillside.....  That is what I fear\nabove all else.' He released a troubled breath.\n\n'The sandstone ridge, the caves to the south, are of stone even worse\nthan the Carak.  And there the mountain cats rule.  I don't know\nwhere else to go.'\n\n'What about Skither's cave?'\n\nHe shook his head.  'Even if Skither has gone to another place (the\nthought that he was injured and unable to return, was something his mind\ncould not accept), the entrance is much too hard to defend. Perhaps we\ncould block up this passage with stones.' He pointed to toward the\nsmaller opening.  'But what can we do with an entrance so high as the\none below?  That is the same reason we cannot stay here.  Soon all\ncreatures will know that Skither is gone, and then the shaft becomes the\nthing impossible to defend.' This was the chance she had waited for,\nbut now she felt reluctant to speak.\n\n'I think.....  I know a way we could barricade the entrance, and make\nthe larger cave safe.' His eyes narrowed upon her turned form,\nsilhouetted against the patch of starry sky beyond.  'It would be\nhard work, and you would have to let me help you.  But it can be\ndone.' Again, though his own shape was lost against the back of the\nenclosure, she felt the deep and sullen trepidation inside him.  'We\ndon't have to think about it now.'\n\n'There is a real way?  That you have seen?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nAfter an interval of silence he moved away, as if to sleep.  But soon\nthe great emptiness and restlessness came over him again.  Hardly\nknowing why, he moved closer and put his arm across her, feeling her\nbody against him.  He lay still for a moment.  His heart beat heavily,\nand slowly his hand found its way to her breast.\n\nSylviana felt this, more aware perhaps than he, of the feelings that lay\nbehind it.  She felt his gentle, yearning caress, closed her eyes\npeacefully and yielded to it until she felt the hand stop, tremble\nslightly, and he moved away again.\n\n'No, Kalus.  It's all right.'\n\nThrough the stir of her emotions a feeling of sudden, firm resolve came\nover her.  She stood up, reached down to her waist, and took off her\nblouse.  She unfastened, and slipped out of her faded jeans.  She\nremoved her underclothes more slowly, her own heart beating heavily, and\nlay down beside him.  And shyly, and affectionately, and longingly drew\nhim close.\n\nHis heart thundering, he pulled away his own garments and surrendered to\nthe torrent inside him.  His last words as emotion and sensation\noverpowered him were strange, yet he spoke them with all his soul.\n\n'I need you.  Sylviana!'\n\nAnd her name flowed like water through the piercing of his heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\n\nA light snow fell from the silent soft grayness of the sky. Sylviana\nstood on the parapet with the fur wrapped around her, immersed in a\nfeeling of peace and attachment to her world such as she had seldom\nexperienced.  She watched Kalus on the ledge below, unaware of her eyes,\nstudying the high entrance to the Mantis' cave and pacing\nuncertainly.  At first, as it often did, her mind questioned his mood.\nHow could he not still feel the warmth and purposeful beauty of their\nlove-making, the gentle gifts that Nature was bestowing on them even\nnow?\n\nBut as she continued to watch him, a feeling of contented understanding\nhad so overwhelmed her doubts as to make them appear small and mean, a\nsource of reproach and beneath further consideration.\n\nFor here, she then expounded, was a creature untainted by civilization\nor corrupt society, his roots in the earth, his feet sometimes painfully\ntouching the ground beneath him, free (indeed unable to do otherwise) to\nreact naturally and honestly, like a graceful and intelligent animal, to\nthe world and circumstances around him.  Therefore, her thoughts\ncontinued, his hopes, fears and yearnings were a direct outgrowth of\nthat world.  His morals, free from religious preconceptions, were\ndictated to him solely and directly by the needs of Nature.\n\nHer last thought came to her as a culmination, almost an orgasm, of all\nthe others that had come before it, tying them together and giving them\nstill greater meaning and significance.  Her lover lived, the more so\nbecause he did not know it, the deepest and purest human existence: that\nof spiritual yearning, and animal desire.\n\nShe pulled the soft fur tighter, massaged one arm with the other, and\nlooked out across the plains.  The snow had all but stopped, and far out\nover the western hills her eyes caught movement against the clouds.  It\nmight have been an eagle but for the unnatural, straight ahead motion of\nits flight.....  Her heart sank. Slowly but steadily the flying shape\ndrew on, till there could be no doubt.  Dejectedly, she called down to\nher companion.\n\n'Kalus.' His head jerked towards her.  'You'd better come up\nhere.' He turned a quick half circle and drew his sword as if\nexpecting danger.  Finding none, he looked up at her with a questioning\ngaze.  Her arm pointed out over the grass- and tree-pocked drifts of the\nsavanna.  Seeing what she saw, but not appearing to, he sheathed his\nsword and began to climb.  Not until far past the halfway point did he\nlook up from the stone in front of him.  Misunderstanding, she pointed\nagain.\n\n'Put down your arm,' he said in guarded tones.  Soon he stood on\nthe parapet beside her, and only then looked out at the lowering sky.\nThe girl spoke.\n\n'It's Skither.'\n\n'No.  It's not.'\n\n'Then who?' He shook his head.\n\nSoon she too could see that it was not the mantis they had known.  It\nwas smaller, and flew with greater speed but less grace.  Also, the feel\nof it was different.  It was very close now, perhaps a mile off, and\nthough it struggled in a growing tail-wind, its wing-plates ruffling\nbadly, it seemed determined not to rest until it had reached the\nmountain, where clearly now it was heading.  Finally it crossed the\ngorge and landed roughly on the ledge, its brownish-green armor looking\nunnatural against the stone and snow.  Kalus, whose tracks showed\nplainly about the entrance, set his jaw and said nothing. Akar limped\nout of the enclosure and stood between them, studying the young mantis.\n\nIt remained motionless, head down and breath coming hard, oblivious to\nanything but its own fatigue.  Finally raising its head, it studied the\ntracks briefly, then turned towards the three of them with no outward\nsign of surprise.  At length it raised an unsteady foreclaw and signaled\nsomeone, apparently Kalus, to come down.  Through her confusion and\nalarm, Sylviana suddenly noticed that its other forelimb was severed\njust below the first joint.  One of its antennae was also missing, and\nit seemed to stand only with an effort.\n\nKalus took a step forward but was stopped by Akar, who took his wrist\ngently but firmly between his jaws.  Kalus relented, and let the wolf\npass instead. Akar made his way to the path, and taxing the wounded\nshoulder only at greatest need, began to descend.  But in an angry\nrocking motion that clearly showed its displeasure, the mantis waved him\noff.  It raised the intact foreclaw once more, this time pointing\nundeniably at Kalus.  He turned to the girl.\n\n'I don't know what this means.  But he will not kill me like this.\nIt is not their way.' He gave his head a severe shake, and made his\nway down the slope.\n\nStepping out onto the ledge as he had once done before Skither, Kalus\nfelt less awe but greater danger.  Not yet an adult, the creature before\nhim was a mystery.  And young and hurt and exhausted, there was no way\nof knowing.....  Stopping at a distance, Kalus began to signal a\ngreeting.\n\nBrushing off his half understood formalities, the mantis came straight\nto the point.  'I am only a messenger,' he began, 'Sent by\nothers to relay this news.  Skither is dead, killed by a mating pair as\nhe tried to draw them out to the place where others stood waiting.'\n\nKalus' heart sank, as if a part of himself had died as well.  He\nhardly noted what followed, and only much later was able to piece it all\ntogether in his mind.\n\nThe seasonal battle in the desert spawning place had been fierce and\ndesperate.  Apparently Skither had half expected such an end, for he\nleft word with his comrades of the man-child and his mate, leaving these\ninstructions for them:\n\n'The cave is now yours, along with everything in it.  This, my\nmessenger, will remain here until he is well enough to move on.  Be of\ngood hope, and continue.'\n\nBut Kalus stood in empty disbelief.  He could not believe, for all that\nhe held to be strong and unchanging had been suddenly, irrevocably cut\nout from under him.  Skither had been more than a symbol to him, he had\nbeen a living god---strength and courage and wisdom personified.  If he\nin all his prowess could be broken, then what chance did he himself have\nagainst the ceaseless ravages of his world?  The question was too much\nfor him.\n\nIn all his days he would see only two more of the noble creatures.\nTheir time on earth running out, it was perhaps a small comfort to know\nthat the reign of their enemies was also passing.  A thousand years of\nradiation and unlimited carrion had raised the tarantula to its huge\nproportions.  But now, like the mantis, who had grown of Nature's\nnecessity alongside it, the giant spiders were an archaic and dying\nrace.  And though each year the gathering was larger---as if some last\ninstinct called all in desperation to the place of spawning---each time\nthe number of eggs left untouched (by the mammals which had come to prey\non them) was smaller.  And without the ensuing cannibalism among the\nhatchlings---out of which several hundred would be reduced to perhaps a\ndozen---those that survived were more feeble, easier for both the\nmantises and natural attrition to kill.  An era born of the violence of\nmen was slowly passing.\n\nKalus turned without ceremony or awareness and made his way back to the\npath.  He climbed without feeling, or knowing where he was, and heard a\nvoice inside him say it was all right, he still had the woman.\n\nThen all at once he felt the fullness of what he had learned, and knelt\ndown and leaned forward against the cold indifferent stone.  His arm\ngave his eyes no comfort.\n\nSkither was dead.\n\nSylviana watched him with apprehension.  She had felt an unreasoning\nterror as he stood before the wounded insect; but now a fear more akin\nto reality, and therefore duller and deeper, presented itself.  She\ncould not know what was said to him, but she knew him well enough to\nunderstand at least a part of what he was feeling.  Some grim news (or\nthreat) had been passed on to him; and because he had been weak, because\nhe had surrendered to emotion, because he had made love, he was being\npunished, and blamed himself.  Such were the scars that his life had\nleft upon him.\n\nWhen at length he looked up at her, she knew that her fears had been\nrealized.  The closeness and love that had been in his eyes so few hours\nbefore, were gone.  All feeling had left him, and he was again trapped\nin the world he did not understand.\n\nHis guiding star was gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\n\nThe next morning when Kalus woke, he felt, through the pain and loss, a\nresurgence (and need) of life and hope.  The cold had crept beneath his\nfur while he slept, and all around him hung a chill moist air that\ncalled for action.  He still cared for the girl, there were other lives\nlinked to his own, and he knew he must continue.  Skither had told him\nhe must.\n\nSo he rose and walked out onto the parapet.  Sylviana was there ahead of\nhim, her eyes tearing from the cold and lack of sleep, wrapped in the\nsame fur that now seemed more a refuge than a friend.  And though he was\nsorry he couldn't, he did not touch her.  She turned to him a face\nthat understood, but hurt the more because of it.  He pretended not to\nnotice.\n\n'Has the mantis come out yet?'\n\n'No.  Akar tried to go to him.  I think he hurt his shoulder again.\nYou can see him---' She pointed just inside the larger entrance, to\nthe place where the wolf waited on its haunches.\n\n'Yes, but it was not done foolishly.  We must move there anyway, and\nsecure it for ourselves as soon as possible.  We will have to work very\nhard, and you will have to help me.' Again his emotions had become an\nunreadable maze.  Sylviana lowered her head and sighed, and the breath\nthe wind blew back through her disheveled hair was clearly visible.\n\n>From this, as well as other tokens, Kalus knew that the first real\n storms of winter were not far off, and tried to gird himself for the\n arduous labor to come.  He was ready to break his back and his heart to\n construct the shelter Sylviana had described, but all pleasure had gone\n out of the thought.\n \nIt was still morning when the young mantis emerged, looking little\nbetter than it had the day before. From the long ripple in the underside\nof its abdomen, both Kalus (who had descended) and the wolf could see it\nhad not eaten.  But when Akar, as best he could, asked if he would not\nstay a day longer and partake of the food that Skither had left him, he\nwas curt to the point of menace.\n\n'I will not dishonor his memory in that way.'\n\n'But surely---'\n\n'I will not dishonor his memory!'\n\nAnd so, without formality or warning cry, without perhaps the proper\npreparation, the creature opened its wings, raised itself into the air,\nand left them forever.  Its form grew small and disappeared into the\nwest like a drowning branch carried past by a river.  And the river\nflowed on, unchanging.\n\nThen Sylviana climbed down and stood beside them, trying to be a part\nof, or at least to understand, what had happened.\n\n'What did he say to you?'\n\n'That he would not eat, or remain another hour.  He seems determined\nto prove that he needs nothing and no one.'\n\nTrying to think in the vernacular of that world, she put in timidly.\n'He will be very strong someday.'\n\n'If he lives.' She said nothing more.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAs if in imitation, Kalus determined to begin the work at once.  Using\none of the poles from the neglected frame, he carved a handle for the\nrusty ax-head the girl had found.  He sharpened its cutting edge as best\nhe could, and with the sun at its height, set out to begin felling\ntrees.\n\nSylviana went with him, along with Kamela, for warning and added\nprotection.  He cut and pieced an entire tree before he would let\nhimself rest.  Then together he and the girl carried a twelve-foot\nsection back to the cave, he bearing most of the weight on his shoulder,\nasking only that the girl come behind and steady him.\n\nAnd so the long toil began.\n\nSylviana's plan, which he modified only slightly, was to build a\nthree-sided barrier of interlocking logs, like an open letter C.  Its\nends would rest just inside the arch, gradually narrowing as they rose,\nnearly flush, against the inner walls of the entrance.  It was to be\nreinforced from within by stout beams, and by the strength of these, as\nwell as by its own girth and weight, to form an impenetrable barrier\nagainst both the elements, and the fiercest predators.  A single,\nwindowless door would pierce the forward wall, and the entire structure\nbe sealed inside and out with mortar, and at the edges, with bricks of\nstone.  Sylviana had read a book as a child in which a family of\npioneers had built a log cabin, using only the materials provided by\nNature.  And now the memory of it served her well.\n\nSo Kalus cut, and they both carried, till she thought her back would\nbreak and Kalus die, where he stood, of exertion.  She could not know\nthat what pained him far more than the ceaseless labor (he had worked as\nhard before) was the fact that he was using all his spiritual, as well\nas physical reserves.\n\nBecause a man can work as hard and diligently as he must, to the extreme\nlimits that mind and body will endure, so long as he has a reason, and a\nneed to do so.  And when it is done to provide food and shelter for the\nlives entrusted to his care, he can work harder and more selflessly\nstill.  But take away his reason, his hope for some kind of betterment,\nhowever distant, and the strongest, most determined man becomes rootless\nand lethargic.  Tasks and dangers he thought little of before, become as\ntedious and harrowing as a literal fight for life. Kalus continued\nbecause he knew, as every animal does, that he must continue.  But as\nthe work sapped his strength and the emotional wound caused by the death\nof Skither bled unchecked, he became first weary, then angry, then\nthrough the ceaseless, hopeless repetition, empty and indifferent.\n\nSometimes when he felt weakest he would look at the girl, and remember\nthe beautiful thing they had shared.  And for a time these memories of\nwarmth and desire would sustain him.  But soon all fantasies of a\npeaceful and prosperous future became nothing more to him than a carrot\ndangling at the end of a stick, though he possessed no such metaphor to\nhelp him understand.  And he had no psychologist to tell him that by\nsubmerging his grief and distancing himself from the girl he was hurting\nhimself, and stifling the healing forces of time and close\ncompanionship.  He cut, and carried, and shaped and fitted, sometimes in\nblinding snow, stopping during daylight hours only to hunt, or to look\nover what had been done. Because he had no choice.\n\nAnd slowly the shelter went up.  Pine and birch and gnarled oak, he laid\nthem down and made a refuge of their bones, as dark thoughts tormented\nhim.\n\nBut the shelter went up.  And the night the frame was completed, and all\nwork done save the filling in of cracks, the heaviest storm of the\nseason moved in and piled three feet of snow outside it, blocking them\nin with drifts up to twice that high.  Without warning or ceremony,\ntheir new home had been christened.\n\nThe next morning Kalus had not the strength to force open the frozen\ndoor, and sat alone by the fire for hours, speaking to no one, feeling\nnothing but weak and shivery exhaustion.  The Cold World, which he had\nsaid he loved, was upon them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 17\n\n\nThat night the two slept together for the first time since word of\nSkither's fall.  Kalus had no strength even to touch, and was moved\nnot at all by his lover's gentle caresses and quiet words, nor even\nby the tears he wiped apologetically from her eyes as she said, 'I\nunderstand.' From this more than any other token, he knew that the\nblows absorbed of a lifetime had finally taken their toll.  He was like\na hurt fighter, hanging on, half waiting for the knockout blow.\n\nHe woke feeling little bitter, his emotions still dazed and floundering,\nto find the girl reading quietly on the stairs that led to the silent\naltar.  The sight reminded him of their first meeting, when he had\nnearly died a physical death.  Perhaps this dull anguish was not as\nbad.....\n\nThen he saw Kamela, and his hopelessness returned.  It was almost as if\nshe longed for death, in any form.  There was no other way to read the\nblank despair of her eyes.  Akar rested stoically beside the girl, his\nown thoughts hidden from view.  Only the pup was stirring, poking\nimpatiently at her mother's underside and whining plaintively for\nfood.  None had eaten meat for several days, and the she-wolf's\nundamaged breasts were dry.\n\nSylviana rose and came closer, gently brushing his hair with her\nfingers.  'I have to hunt,' he said flatly.  Then suddenly as she\nturned away he pulled her close and buried his head against her.\n\n'Forgive me,' he said.  And with those words a flicker of feeling\ncame back to him.\n\n'It's all right,' she said.  'Let it out.' But he could\nnot let it out.  His body would not allow the expenditure.  '... When\ndo you have to hunt?'\n\n'In the afternoon, when the sun is warmer and I am stronger.  I feel\nso weak.' He shook his head to fight off a tear of exhaustion.\n'Is there any water left?' She brought it, along with a\nhalf-filled bowl of sebreum.  He ate readily, though his body cried out\nfor meat.\n\nShe sat beside him on the bed, speaking softly and brushing out his\nhair.  It did not matter what she said.  Her voice was like music, and\nher nearness and touch a therapy no money could buy.  And like a sleeper\nwoken by a lover's kiss, he began to respond.  His body was still\nvery weak, but Kalus was a creature whose heart held the key to all\nsurvival.\n\nAnd he began to remember that he was, in fact, a survivor.  The fiery\nvigor of his soul spoke words of endurance and starting again.  In the\nmiddle of a sentence he reached over and kissed her with his lips, teeth\nand tongue, and half playfully, half longingly, bit her cheek.\n\nAs he drew back, knowing he had not the strength, he was struck by the\nlook she gave him, her face so close.  And he was jarred to his very\nbones by the realization. . .that she wanted him.  WANTED him.\n\nAll his life, the best he had hoped for was a companion who would\ntolerate him, and be grateful for his strength and affection.  But in\nSylviana's eyes there was a longing as deep and real as his.  Perhaps\nshe even loved. . .HIM.  In his current state it was almost too much,\nand he became afraid.  Again, through the wild hopes she inspired in\nhim, he felt the fear of losing her, or of being killed himself.  His\nface could not hide the intensity of what he was feeling.\n\n'What is it?' she asked.  'What's wrong?'\n\n'I don't know. I.....  You know that I am weak now.  Is that all\nright?'\n\nShe took his head to her chest in an outpouring of emotion as primal as\nany she had ever known.  'Yes.  It's all right.' And in that\nmoment of honesty and total surrender, she did love him.  But she too\nbacked away, because they were not yet in a place to feel love all the\nway.  She cleared her eyes, breathed in and stood up straight.\n\n'Right now you're going to eat again, and I don't want to hear\nabout rationing.  You've been putting out for weeks, and it's time\nyou took something back in.  Then you're going to lie down and rest.\nUnderstood?' He nodded, and touched her hair.  Then she took his bowl\nand went into the back.\n\nHe too felt the need to surrender, and to trust, as Skither had told\nhim.  He remembered his words.  'Do not carry the weight alone.  It\nwill crush you.' Yes, he felt nearly crushed.  Whatever end would\ncome of it, this day at least he must let go.\n\nSo when he had eaten he lay down on the bed, and asked Sylviana to sit\nbeside him.  She did, and to pass the time he asked her a question\nsuggested to him by the altar, the dulled mirror, and the memory of his\nfirst days in that place.\n\n'How did you come to befriend Akar?  I've often wondered.'\n\n'You're not asking just to make me feel better?'\n\n'No, truly.'\n\nShe was more than willing to recount the one glad memory of her long\nvigil, alone in a strange land with danger and confusion all around.\n'Well.  To say that I was distraught those first few weeks.....  Try\nto understand.  The first thing I saw when I finally mustered the\ncourage to go out onto the ledge, was some kind of big cat dragging down\na horse at the very edge of the ravine.  I got so scared I didn't\nknow what to do.  The cave seemed little enough protection, but at least\nthere I could hide.  I know you must have thought me a coward.'\n\n'No, you were wise.  And the big cat did you a favor.' There was\nno sarcasm in his voice.\n\n'Anyway.  Once I figured out that sebreum was something I could eat,\nas much as I cursed myself for it, I just couldn't make myself go out\ninto that world.  Then there was the Voice, telling me to stay there,\nand wait for some kind of sign.\n\n'I was alone and scared and miserable.  That anything at all could\nwalk through the open entrance and tear me apart was obvious, and it\nreally started getting to me.  The few animals I saw when I stood just\ninside it seemed reluctant to venture too close, but that wasn't much\ncomfort.  And of course I had no idea why.\n\n'But one night, just as the sun was setting, I caught a glimpse of\nsomething slip down into the ravine from the far side, which had always\nbefore been the line they wouldn't cross.  I hoped my eyes were\nplaying tricks on me, and I didn't see or hear anything else for a\nwhile.  But some kind of other sense told me I was in danger, and that\nwhatever it was I had seen was coming closer.  I got so scared I ran to\nthe bed and hid beneath the furs, as if that was any protection, and\nfound myself shaking like a leaf.\n\n'I couldn't just lie there, and when I realized how stupid and\nhelpless I was being, I got angry.  So I decided to go into the back and\ndig out some kind of weapon. It may have been my one real moment of\ncourage.'\n\n'There have been others,' he said quietly.  She turned towards\nhim, and wondered why these simple words meant so much.  'Go on.'\n\n'All right.  I went into the back and found the hunting knife.  I was\nso determined and angry that for about thirty seconds I forgot to be\nafraid.  It was a wonderful, defiant feeling.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Unfortunately it didn't last.  I walked back into the front to\nfind a big, gaunt wolf staring me down, bristling and snarling.  It was\nAkar, but he didn't look at all the way he does now.  His ribs\npractically stuck through his skin with hunger.  His side was gashed and\ncaked with mud and dried blood.....  It was horrible.\n\n'I screamed and practically threw the knife across the floor.  I just\ncouldn't take it.  I dropped to my knees, shaking and crying like a\nmad thing.  I fell forward on my arms and just lay there, covering my\nhead.....  I thought my life was over.  But Akar never moved.' She\ngazed across at her first companion, eyes glistening.\n\n'Do you know what it's like to expect death and find friendship?\nHe was hurt, Kalus, badly.  And half starved, I'm sure.  He could\nhave killed me so easily, to save himself.....  I looked up after maybe\nfive minutes, to find him just watching me, with all the hatred gone out\nof his eyes.  He came closer and I thought I would scream again, but he\nstopped.\n\n'The rest doesn't need to be said, I guess.  But you have to know,\nI've never been so moved in all my life as when he finally came up to\nme, and I realized he meant no harm.  Just to have a friend, to hold and\ntouch, after all that fear.  To not be alone anymore.  You can't know\nhow much that meant to me.' She lowered her head and cried silently,\nand Kalus found to his dismay that a tear had escaped his eyes as well.\n\n'I know,' he said.  'That is how I felt when Barabbas saved\nme.' He wanted to say that she would never be alone again, but he\ncouldn't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 18\n\n\nThe escape and release were not lasting.  Almost the moment Sylviana\nstopped speaking, he felt the cold dread of what he must do return from\nits small distance.  He must leave this safe place and hunt.  And though\nunder present circumstances the odds against him were appalling, he knew\nhe had to try.  If the reserves of salted meat were tapped too soon, the\nsebreum not rationed, they would all starve in the cold heart of Winter.\nTrust, and wishing it otherwise, could not alter the fact.\n\n'I must go,' he told her. 'Keep the door shut and bolted until\nI return.  This is a dangerous time.'\n\n'Why?  I thought most of the predators were gone.'\n\n'There are always stragglers, and outcasts.  They do well for a time,\nbut with the coming of deep snow find they cannot hunt, or even retreat.\nNear starvation makes them desperate, and they will attack almost\nanything.' These words, along with the anxious body language she had\nlearned to read in him---taut expression and deep, determined\nbreathing---frightened her.\n\n'Be careful.'\n\n'Of course.  I will take Kamela, if she will come.' He put on his\nheavy winter robe of buffalo skin, buckled the sword around it, and went\nto the door.\n\nKamela rose to follow, but Akar limped down from his place beside the\naltar and tried to interpose his body between her and the way she wished\nto go.  Words passed between them which could not be understood by the\nothers.  Kalus saw only that Akar sensed some danger, to Kamela in\nparticular, and did not wish them to go.  But the she-wolf growled\nsullenly and pushed past him.  Akar, who knew her thoughts, relented.\n\n'You leave love behind you,' he said solemnly, and returned to his\nplace.  Her eyes followed him, and she looked to the sleeping form of\nthe pup.  Then turned away almost sorrowfully.  She had felt love even\nthen, and it was more than she could bear.\n\nKalus could not at first open the door.  After several frustrated\nattempts he set down his sword, threw off the fur and angrily set to\nwork.  He pushed, pulled back, cursed and set his full weight against\nit.\n\nAt last the snow and icy jambs relented, and they went out into the\nwindy sea of powder.  They passed through the gorge, and out onto the\ntable-like plain.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKamela could not block the images from her mind; they rose in their full\nintensity before her.  The death of Shaezar, whom she had learned to\nlove.  The brutal rape by Shar-hai and his guard.  Then the murder of\nher two sons, too small even to understand what was happening.  A line\nof horror had been crossed inside her, from which there was no\nreturning.\n\nThey struggled together through the snow, these two whom life had\nwounded, the wolf mortally, the man to within the balance of a hair,\nthough he still had hope.  Kalus, knowing her pain, cut the best swath\nhe could, and Kamela followed behind him.  The wind had distributed the\nsnow unevenly, so that in some places movement was relatively easy, in\nothers, nearly impossible.  The thick overcast of the sky threatened\nfurther storm, and the white of the accumulated snow could not fully\nilluminate the darkened landscape.\n\nThey traveled north where Kalus hoped, though his heart was sickened by\nit, to find a frozen deer among the outlying forests.  They really had\nno other chance.  The plains animals were gone, live deer were too\nswift, and no rabbit or fox would be stirring in the extreme cold of\nthis day.\n\nSo he trudged northward, chilled and sweating, using strength his body\ndid not have to give.  His stomach felt hollow and sickly; his muscles\ntrembled with fatigue.  But he knew (or thought) the alternative was\ndespair, and his mind was not clear enough to perceive the danger.  So\nhe continued.\n\nAnd as he pushed on, farther and farther beyond the limits of endurance,\nit was as if he passed through a veil and walked, literally, into\nanother world.  Time and distance became confused. . .and still on his\nfeet he dreamed of straggling columns of men, plodding through a frozen\ncountryside.  Ragged blue uniforms clung to their backs, to his.\nWounded and sick, with helpless eyes searching both sides of the road,\nfearful of ambush.  A comrade addressed him in French.....\n\nHe stumbled forward in the snow, recovered himself.  The world was quiet\nand deathly still.  Kamela stood beside him, tense and erect, ears\nraised and eyes searching.  They had wandered into a recession between\nwooded hills, where the snow was thick and visibility difficult.  A pine\nbranch released its burden of white, and suddenly he felt it too.  They\nwere being watched. He had led them into an ambush.....\n\nA dark shape flitted between trees on the eastern slope.  A low,\nimpatient growling was heard.  Kalus drew his sword to make a stand, but\nKamela would not let him.  She bolted toward the slope even as a rush of\nmovement erupted there.  Two thin and ravening wolves, along with three\nhyenas, broke from cover and began to converge upon the line she made,\nstraight for them.\n\nHer motive was simple.  Her own life meant nothing, and the man-child\nneed not die.  Also, there was the chance for revenge.  She ran toward\ndeath free and unafraid.\n\nKalus hesitated, unsure of enemies behind, and by the time he turned and\nmade up his mind to follow, it was too late.  They were upon her,\nharrying and tearing in a scene made horrible and slow-motion by the\nsnow.  Yet somehow she snarled free and lunged at one of the wolves, who\nhad stumbled.  The others tore into her side and back legs, but her\nteeth had found their mark, and her last desire was fulfilled.  The\nbrutal Armus, black wolf of Shar-hai's guard, fell gasping and\nbleeding, his throat cut.  As Kamela surrendered willingly to death.\n\nShe was gone, and Kalus knew it, and the worst part was that his mind\nhad already begun to accept it.  Raging at his weakness and cowardice,\nhe rushed toward the scene of her bloody debauch.\n\nBut for all his reckless will and hatred, his body simply would not\nrespond.  He had not gone twenty paces before his heart and lungs\nscreamed in revolt, and all strength left him.  At the same moment the\nhyenas left their kill and savagely blocked his path.  Their bristling,\nsnarling warnings said as clearly as words.  'Be gone, or we will\nkill you, too.'\n\nAnd as he stood helpless, mustering all his courage just to stand and\nlook imposing, the remaining wolf rushed past them and would have\nattacked. But the others would not follow, and he was reluctant to face\nKalus' sword alone.  By her final act of defiance, Kamela had saved\nhis life.\n\nThe hyenas returned to the still body of the she-wolf, and bickering\namong themselves, began to drag it back into the forest.  The companion\nof Armus stood for a time beside him, as if expecting him to somehow\nshake off the stroke and rise again.  But soon he saw that the wound was\nmortal, and knew his own life was in danger if he stayed.  The hyenas\nwould turn on him next, and he had no illusions about what would happen\nto the body of his friend.  He turned to the northwest, and disappeared\nbeneath the silently whispering pines.\n\nKalus was left alone with the dying wolf.  And as he watched its\nterrified eyes grow dull slowly like a fire that had burned itself to\nnothing, he felt he watched his own death as well.  He had failed again,\nmiserably, and felt all chance for survival, and the will to continue,\nevaporate.  He fell to his knees in exhaustion, and heard the lone wolf\nat its distance release a long howl of despair. Night fell, and darkness\nwas all around him.\n\n\n*\n\n\nWalking back alone was perhaps the hardest thing he had ever had to do.\nIn his darkened state he felt he had no reason to live, but some\nstubborn and unvanquished voice told him he must return.  Weak and\ntrembling, genuinely ill, he had no other goal but to reach the cave and\ncollapse.  Digging deep, time and time again, he searched for the will\nto go on, just a little farther, holding the image of the girl like an\nicon and a Quest before him.  Many times he stumbled, and had to rouse\nhimself to keep from lying down to sleep, and die, in the snow.  So weak\nand pathetic had his movement become that two jackals thought to attack\nhim, and had to be driven back, though they followed the rest of the\nway.\n\nAt long, impossible length he reached the gorge path and slithered down.\nUpon reaching its base he could not at first rouse himself to continue.\nA great wall of despairing fatigue seemed to stand before him, on top of\nhim, and in his bones, an impenetrable 'No' formed of unendurable\nstone.  He was tired, and the weight was too much.\n\nHis one desire at that moment was to sleep and say goodbye.  Just sleep.\nSylviana would understand.  After all, she still had Akar.  Together\nthey could fly with Skither to the Island, and all would be well.  And\nhe smiled, because Skither was not dead.  That was only a dream.\nTogether they rode on his wings, above the parting clouds.....\n\nThrough the delirium he heard a confused sound of high yapping barks and\ndeeper, more terrible growls.  Then he felt a tugging at his shoulder\nand finally, the cutting of teeth.  He jerked forward in dismay,\nexpecting to be assailed.\n\nBut the call to life had come from Akar, who stood guarding him quietly\nin the darkness, stood waiting for him to revive, stand, and make the\nfinal effort.  Kalus raised himself slowly, let out a groan of pain and\nloss, then followed him up the merciless incline.\n\nAt length a door was opened in front of him and a feverish light\nstreamed out.  He fell forward.  Perhaps someone caught him; perhaps\nthey did not.\n\nHe knew nothing more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 19\n\n\nKalus revived (or came to) the next morning, but could not at first\nremember where he was.  The events of the day before had struck so\nsuddenly.....  Again he lay in the bed of cool moss, covered with furs,\nhis wounds being treated by the soothing hands of a woman-child.  He\nturned as if in a dream to look upon the face of his redeemer.\n\nBut no, that was long ago.  Now the woman-child was his friend, his\nmate.  Was it possible?  Why was the chamber so cold?  And what of the\nwolf-cub that lay nestled beside him?  As the cloud of amnesia, like a\nblow to the head which jarred him to another time, slowly cleared, he\nremembered.  And understood.  The images of Kamela's death came back\nto him with feverish clarity.  He shivered, and a burst of physical\npanic made him bolt upright, scattering the furs and startling the cub.\nThe girl took him by the shoulders and forced him back down.\nUnprotected, his skin felt icy cold, and his body ached with a dull,\nyellow pain.\n\nOne by one the furs were replaced on top of him.  He did not fight, but\nclung to them as if to life, and tucked the edges beneath him to block\nout the cold.  The need to struggle back to warmth was so great, and so\nimmediate, that his mind had no time for despair, or the full\nrealization of his plight.  He shivered, and sucked his aching teeth and\nthought of nothing.  At length he slept, though fitfully and full of\ndark dream.\n\nHe woke to find his worst fears come true.  He was weak and ill, trapped\nin Winter, physically unable to fight for his survival.  There was\nlittle food, and now no chance of getting more.  The woman-child he\nloved, and the pup whose life was now his responsibility, would perish\nalongside him.  All was ended.  He had failed.\n\nBut all was not ended.  That would have been too simple and absolute.\nThey still had the reserves, though tapping into them so soon went\nagainst all his instincts, and roused the already powerful voices of\nfear inside him.  And though to one who has never had to survive,\nliterally, day to day, these emotions may seem mere words, to Kalus they\nwere as powerful and menacing as the physical threat of a lion.  How\nmuch more of this could his spirit endure?  To rise, again and again,\nfrom the decimations of this world, to go on without hope for so long,\nnever seeing the end of the tunnel.\n\nBecause a man who finds the tight-rope of his existence drawn so fine,\nthe abyss below him so deep and terrifying, can never see the natural\nand benevolent forces that may (or may not) come to his aid.  But the\ndangers and possible means of his downfall, wrapped with fear and based\non past experience, are as clear to him as the struggling flesh he\ninhabits.  For truth and fear exist only inches apart, and fear, by its\nvery nature, will always seem the stronger voice.  Men have faced this\nsame darkness for thousands of years, and many fallen before it.  And\nthe darkness never ends.\n\nKalus felt, as he always had in times of deep struggle, the eternal\ndesire for life that calls a man to action in the face of danger, and\ncourage in the face of despair.  But he also felt something altogether\nnew, or at least, never before felt at this level of intensity.  He felt\na flat and empty indifference that told him all such effort was futile,\neven laughable, in the eyes of the gods who tormented him.  Just as a\nlaboratory animal that can endure no more torture will simply stop\neating and slowly die of shock, he too felt that he had been punished\nlong enough, that any reasonable bounds of endurance had been long since\npassed, and that the hopeless games of this world no longer held any\nmeaning for him.  He saw only death: his father mauled by a bear, Shama\ntorn open by Shar-hai and his guard, who had themselves been dragged\nback to earth.  Skither, who had died alone in a stinking hole at the\nhands of mindless brutes, protecting others who were heedless.  And at\nthe last, when his spirit had nothing left, Kamela, who had perished to\nsave his own, meaningless life.\n\nThe truth now seemed so clear to him that he was amazed he had not seen\nit before.  All the useless struggles ended in death, either quickly, or\nin humiliating sickness and old age.  All earthly bonds were passing,\ntorn asunder by the whims of Nature and uncaring Time.  And therefore\nall life was futile.  Still worse, it was absurd.  A man who possessed\nreal courage only wasted it in endlessly trying to continue.  Let him\ntake that courage instead and say, 'Enough!  This torture must not be\nallowed to continue.  If I cannot choose the manner of my life, I will\nat least choose the manner, and time of my death.' Kalus knew nothing\nof existentialism, or the other fashionable philosophies of men.  He\nknew nothing of the religious fears of mankind, or of his angry,\ndespairing pride in himself.  He knew only that his heart was broken,\nand he wanted to die.  The dull and hopeless look that had fixed itself\nin the eyes of Kamela, became his as well.\n\nHe no longer cared, and had lost all fear of death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 20\n\n\nThe wind howled outside them and the chamber held no warmth.  His body\nshivered and coughed, and excreted the pain that knew no bounds.\nSylviana moved the fire closer to the bed, then tried to seal out the\nwind that stole through the cracks in the barrier.\n\nIt was hard and frustrating work.  But rather than crumble to see Kalus\nlaid so low, and become cold and distant, she sensed that responsibility\nfor their survival had been shifted onto her, and she responded.\nThrough all the trials, all the highs and lows that she had endured the\nlast year of her life, she would have thought she'd have nothing\nleft, and that such a crisis would be her final undoing.  But she was\nwrong.  A quiet strength and maturity had been growing inside her, and\nnow she put it to the test.\n\nForming the mortar to fill the cracks required effort and endless\nperseverance.  The hard earth below them, packed solid for so long, was\nreluctant to be uprooted and mixed with melting snow beside the fire.\nAnd the straw that was called for was simply unavailable.  So she took\ndry pine needles, ground them up, and mixed them in by hand.  The only\nlarge \u0091bowl' they possessed---a curving palette of stone---held\nonly a small amount compared to the number and size of the cracks she\nmust fill, and it was heavy and awkward.  Then the mortar itself seemed\nnot to want to stay where it was put.  It took constant adjustments in\nthe mix and in her technique just to find a half workable formula.  Her\nhands were cold and ragged and pricked by countless needles, and there\nwas no one to encourage her or appreciate the effort.  Kalus was\noblivious, in sleep or in waking, and Akar was off somewhere alone.  The\npup followed her with its eyes and occasionally whimpered for food. That\nwas all.\n\nBut that was not what mattered.  The man she cared for, and who had done\nthe same for her many times, was sick and helpless.  She stayed with the\ntask all through the night, until the work was done.  Then at last,\nwearily, she made her way to the bed and knelt beside him.  His fever\nstill burned, and the cold drafts that pulsed down through the shaft\nstill troubled him.\n\nShe thought to make up his bed somewhere else, but realized that laying\nhim on the cold floor might be worse.  She looked over through the\nshadows at the dais beneath the altar, but could not think how to bring\nthe fire close enough.....  The pup, lonely, hungry and confused, moved\nbeside her and looked up at her with pleading eyes.  She comforted it as\nbest she could, then gently roused her companion.\n\n'Kalus?'\n\n'Yes.' His voice was flat, though he shivered.\n\n'Later today I have to go to one of the reserves of meat, for the pup\nat least.  Then maybe move you to the dais, if that will help.  Where is\nthe nearest of the reserves?'\n\nHe shook his head without a sound.  Misunderstanding, she got angry.\n\n'Why not?  Don't you even care about the pup?'\n\nAgain he shook his head, and said in a hoarse voice.  'Too\ndangerous.'\n\n'Damn,' she said.  'Damn it all.' True, bitter frustration\nhad caught her at last, a destructive anger which found no release.  She\nstood up and paced wildly around the room. He knew what she was feeling,\nand it troubled him.\n\n'Where is Akar?' he asked.\n\n'I don't know,' she replied, her anger turning swiftly to\nconcern, then bordering on panic.  'He's been out since last\nnight.' It would be the last straw if something had happened.....\n\nShe stiffened, hearing a scratching sound at the door.  Fearing the\nworst, her mind made no connection until she heard a sharp bark, and\nKalus said.  'It's the wolf.'\n\nAs she forced open the door against the onslaught of snow-laced wind,\nshe slid down, shivering in the cold and wet.  Akar slipped past her.\nWhen at last she recovered herself and rose and closed the door, she\nleaned back against it to face him, her emotions strained to the limit.\n\nWhen she saw what he carried she knelt down and embraced him and wept.\nThough weak and injured himself, his mobility hampered still further by\nthe snow, somehow he had done it.  A large rabbit lay on the floor\nbeside him.\n\n'How did you do it?' she stammered.  'When we needed it\nmost.' Again she buried her face against him, in her exhaustion\nunable to stop crying.\n\n'Because he has the heart of a champion,' said Kalus, himself both\nmoved and ashamed.  The help unlooked-for had arrived, and they would\nlive a little longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 21\n\n\nThe next day Kalus felt a little better.  The small portion of meat he\nhad been able to push past his swollen throat had calmed his delirium,\nand seemed to help his body generate a little warmth of its own.  But he\nwas still very sick, and any attempt to get up and move about was met\nwith failure and a stern rebuke from the girl.  She didn't realize,\nand possibly shouldn't have, that to Kalus being helpless was the\nequivalent of being dead.  This attempt at the least physical exertion,\nwalking, was his way of rejecting fear and trying, impossible as the\ntask seemed, to turn away from the inner darkness that told him his life\nwas over.\n\nBecause Kalus, too, had great heart.  No matter how many times he was\nbroken, he had always been able to rally somehow and go on.  The problem\nnow was that he had lost sight of that faith and hope, the belief that\nno matter what happened, he would always find a way to survive, and keep\nthe spirit alive inside him.  His confidence in himself, at best of\ntimes uncertain because of the severity of the roads which led to\nmanhood, was all but extinguished.\n\nThere had been so little margin for error in his life, and worse had\ncome to worst so many times, that he could not help but wonder if he\npossessed some terrible flaw, some shortcoming which made failure\ninevitable.  But when he looked at this more closely, he knew in his\nheart that he had always done his best: that he had taken the only paths\nopen to him, that he had never quit, or expected anything to be easy or\nfree.\n\nWhat was it then that defeated him?  To this he had no answer, only\nfrustrated rage that having no release, turned inward upon itself.  The\nbitter maze of his emotions had joined together into a tightly knotted\nand irremovable clot, blocking out all light and making life, even the\nsimplest continuance, seem utterly impossible.\n\nAnd yet another element had been thrown into the balance.  He had\ndiscovered, almost suddenly, the depths of his love for Sylviana.  And\nwhile this might have comforted him and been a source or quiet strength,\ntwo nagging fears had risen alongside it, which in his present state\nseemed undeniable.  First, though he knew she cared for him, and in her\nway even loved him, that was now, when her need was greatest and there\nwas no one else to choose from.  What if someday there were others?  And\nsecondly, of more immediate concern, he felt he could not take care of\nher, or give her the things she needed to live.  His every attempt had\nended in failure and near disaster, and he clearly saw the price it cost\nher.  He felt for this reason, and others like it, that he had no right\nto think of her as his own, a belief which galled his animal self to no\nend.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAs all of this passed inside him, Sylviana continued to work quietly\naway, doing everything she could think of to stabilize the temperature\nof the enclosure.  First she took pine branches they had used as a blind\noutside the barrier, and placed them in a careful thatching pattern\ninside the shaft, here at the bottom where it was narrowest.  This still\nallowed the smoke to pass up through it, if more slowly, but also kept\nout much of the wind, especially the sudden gusts which seemed to\ntrouble him so.\n\nThen she made a canopy of the projecting altar above his bed, stitching\ntogether a patchwork of smaller skins to hang down from it.  She also\nheated stones beside the fire, and placed them by his side when he\nslept.\n\nBut perhaps the wisest and most beneficial thing she did for him in\nthose days, beside not giving up herself, was to read to him.  It\noccurred to her that one of the things that made his life so difficult\nwas the fact that his deepest thoughts remained isolated: he didn't\nknow that other men felt the same emptiness, and confronted the same\nunspoken fears.  So she dug into the long, enclosed bookshelf that lay\nhalf buried in a corner of the treasure room, until she found works of\nfiction and philosophy which seemed appropriate.  She then read to him\nfragments of each, asking which he preferred.\n\nHe was cold to the idea at first, not understanding, and expressed no\npreference.  But she noticed that his eyes became puzzled and alert at\nthe first chapter of 'For Whom the Bell Tolls,' and that he seemed\nto want to ask questions, but did not.\n\nSo she read him several chapters each day, until at last he began to\nopen up, and to ask her.  Had men really lived that way?  Why did Robert\nJordan not take the woman he loved far away from the war?  And was it\nreally possible to feel the earth move beneath them when they made love?\n\nAnd slowly, as always, quietly, the profound pain and beauty of true\nliterature began to work its haunting and healing magic upon him.  His\nthought no longer bounded by the physical reality around him, he found\nin books a way to escape and look beyond himself, into worlds he had\nnever dreamed of, and to empathize with struggles and disillusioning he\nhad imagined did not exist outside himself.  Simply put, he became\nconnected to the souls, singular and collective, of humanity.\n\nAnd to know the woman held all these things in her mind and in her\nheart, put him almost in awe of her.  And in truth, she herself received\nmore from the living pages than she had ever done before.  Now that her\nown life had become so real, she discovered (probably something she\nknew, deep down) that the truly great writers did not exaggerate the\nintensity of human drama, or the power of their own emotions, but only\nspoke honestly and without dilution of the worlds that they had known.\nDickens especially she loved, because he made her feel the joys and\nterrors of children, who from the outset of life had experienced sorrow\nand loss, when her own childhood had been so safe and full, the death of\nher mother notwithstanding.  And she, too, began to see Kalus\ndifferently, and to understand some measure of the invisible pain he\nfelt.\n\nAt times it was almost too much, for both of them, to look at life so\nclosely in the midst of danger, and he would ask her to stop, or she\nwould set down the book she read silently to herself.  Such was the\npower of those days.  With the intensity of Nature's relentless\nbackdrop, emotions were tested like ship's rigging in a gale.  And\nboth knew, despite the woman's stubborn optimism, that it would take\nmore than all their courage for the ship to still float brokenly at the\nmorning of calm sea's return.\n\nInvaluable time was passing, and Kalus' illness refused to heal.  His\nbody had been pushed beyond its limits, and a virus for which he had no\ndefense (for it was carried by the girl) had entrenched itself in his\nlungs and intestines, spreading pain and chill weakness throughout.  An\nunfair battle had been joined inside him, one in which will alone was\nnot enough.\n\nThe man-child's hand was forced, and all power to choose taken from\nhim. He must learn patience in the face of starvation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 22\n\n\nTwo weeks passed, following much the same pattern: Kalus trying to fight\nback against sickness and despair, his inner fire burning ever lower, a\ncontinuing downward spiral.  And the girl, trying to hold on to hope\nenough for both of them.  But despite the books and her new-found\ncourage, she too began to feel numbed by the incessant howling of\nWinter, that raged like a mindless brute outside their doors, reaching\nin with deadly fingers at the slightest opportunity.  She was puzzled\nalso by Kalus' inability to recover from what seemed to her a simple,\nif severe, virus.\n\nBut if she was puzzled, Kalus was devastated.  His entire existence,\nfrom youngest boyhood, had been based around hardihood and the ability\nto overcome wound, sickness and depravation. In his world those who\ncould not do so perished.  All the hard lessons he had learned, centered\naround one simple and unalterable necessity: self-reliance.  And here he\nwas, flat on his back, unable to fight or recover, unable to support\neven himself, let alone those he cared for.  He was less than useless, a\ndrain on their efforts, on their need to reject him and go on.  Never\nhad he known such helplessness.\n\nBut here the words run out.  It was not a single catastrophic event, nor\na succession of smaller devastations, which led him to his moment of\ndestruction, but a lifetime of endless conflict, broken dreams and dark,\ntwisted, hopeless roads.  There was nothing left to say or feel. He\nsimply could not go on.  As Sylviana read to him the last chapter of\nHemingway, the futility of life congealed into a single, inescapable\nblade that no longer hovered at a distance, but stood poised like a\nneedle above his heart.  All was black, and like Kamela before him the\nvery throbbing of his heart, with its surges of love and hope was the\nfinal, crushing despair.\n\nHe waited until the girl was asleep, then put her knife into the soft\nflesh beneath his ear and began to cut downward, a sinister, sweeping\nsmile.\n\nBut the pain was greater than he imagined, and something yet stronger\nstayed his hand.  It wasn't that he lacked the courage.  But if felt\nso very, very wrong.  After all the battles he had fought and the\nhardships endured, all the times that death had been beaten back. . .to\nbe his own undoing.....  The instinct to survive had been too deeply\ningrained.  He dropped weeping and bleeding on his face, writhing in\nunquenchable anguish.\n\nHe still might have bled to death, but for the constant miracle that\nlived on unnoticed in their midst: the blind desire and yearning of\nyouth, embodied in the new and emerging life of the pup.  His elbow\nlanded hard on one of its paws as it slept, and knowing nothing of\nhopelessness and death, it simply did what its senses told it to.  It\ncried out.\n\nRoused by the sound the girl came closer, lifted aside the canopy, and\nafter a moment of helpless terror, turned Kalus onto his back and with\nshaking hands worked to stop the bleeding.\n\n\n*\n\n\nBut the damage had been done.  With that last paroxysm of emotion, all\nfeeling left him.  He was not only resigned to death, he believed the\nprocess had already begun.  As the girl watched helplessly, he became\nlike a critically abused child, neither eating nor speaking, without\nexpression or sorrow or movement.  His spirit was already dead, and\nwaited only for the body to follow.  The girl wept openly on his chest,\nbut the seeds of his heart refused to grow.  His tale was over, a\ntragedy.\n\nOn the third day he asked for a sip of water, told the girl that he\nloved her, and asked her to forgive him.  She said nothing and he went\nto sleep, expecting never to be wakened in this world again.\n\n\n*\n\n\nBut just as the spirit is not slave to the body, neither does the body\ncease to function simply because the will commands it.  Though he had\ngiven up on life, life had not yet given up on him.  Death, if he truly\ndesired it, wasn't going to be that easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 23\n\n\nThe night was bitter and stark, with hard stars like countless\npin-pricks staring lidless upon the Earth.  The world itself was equally\nsharp, trees frozen, rocks cracking with the cold.  But one creature,\nnot yet versed in Night's supremacy, struggled on against the icy\nstillness.\n\nThe yearling tiger moved drunkenly forward, at intervals collapsing upon\nits injured hind leg.  Weak from hunger and loss of blood, the dizziness\nwas becoming chronic.  It lay for a time where it had fallen, licking\nthe hard snow and fighting, instinctively, to remain conscious.  Though\nborn to withstand the numbing cold there were other dangers, and death,\na thing it did not understand but instinctively feared, was not far off.\n\nSomehow it had wandered into a cleft between high walls.  Forward or\nbackward, it could not now recall.  It regained its feet and struggled\non.  All bearing and sense of direction lost, it suddenly found itself\nconfronted by a steep incline, rising darkly from the soft blur of\nwhite.  Too young to know genuine despair, and too far gone to think\notherwise, it began to climb.  It sensed light, or warmth, or something\nahead.  All reason and strength slipped away as the world became level\nagain, and it staggered forward unthinking, nothing more than a moth\ndrawn by flame.\n\nSomething unyielding blocked its path, and now it smelled food.  It\nscratched feebly and let out a mournful growl.  Then all sense faded,\nand if fell into the drifting snow.\n\n\n*\n\n\nSylviana heard a scratching sound at the door, then something that\nsounded as if the night itself had been given bitter voice.  Akar was\nnot with them, and the only image stark enough to penetrate her malaise,\nand therefore seem real to her, said that it was the wolf, wounded and\nprobably dying.  She went shaking to the door, worked free the bolt, and\nthrust it open.  There she saw something large and unfamiliar, heard\n(whether in reality or delirium) something akin to a vicious growl: the\nvoice given teeth.  She took a step back, and screamed.\n\nIt was perhaps the one sound which could have roused him.  Kalus sat\nbolt upright, weak but stable, and called out to her.\n\n'Sylviana!'\n\nHe felt the cold wind rushing past.  The door was open.  She was in\ndanger.  He stood with difficulty and made his way towards her, holding\non through the dizziness that sought to rob his will.  He stood beside\nher, leaning heavily against the door-frame, and stared out into the\nnight.  She had regained her rationality, and now looked down upon a\nwounded and half-starved predator.\n\nPity stirred at last in Kalus' heart, as if a sign had been given and\nunderstood.  There was no time to question, or debate whether his own\nlife was worth saving.  Here was a creature, young and without guilt,\nwho would die if he did not act.\n\n'Sylviana.  Help me carry him in.'\n\n'Are you all right?' She looked hard at him, and he answered\nhonestly.\n\n'I'm not the one who matters now. Will you help me?'\n\nShe nodded vaguely and together they lifted the tiger as best they\ncould, bringing it inside.  Though fully six feet long, in its ravaged\ncondition it couldn't have weighed more than two hundred pounds.  But\nit was limp, lifeless weight, and the best they could manage was to lay\nit just inside the barrier.\n\n'It's all right,' Kalus panted, head down.  'This is a snow\ntiger.  He won't need much more heat than this.  It's more the\nmangled leg, and starvation.' He looked across at the woman-child,\nand perceived for the first time the dismal state into which she herself\nhad fallen, a malady of the mind, which had then spread to the body.\n\nHe felt ashamed, and frightened, and glad all at once.  He was needed,\nand his desire to live had somehow returned from its shallow grave,\nembodied in the weakened, but far from dead creature at his feet.\n\nAnd his own body, he knew from deepest instinct, was not yet ready to\nsurrender.  On the contrary, it had made a small recovery.  The two-day\nfast and stubborn, death-like sleep had emptied his throbbing\nintestines, and given his natural defenses time to adapt and regain some\nmeasure of their innate strength.  He was still very sick, but maybe\nnow.....\n\nThe words, 'Forgive me,' played upon his lips but had an empty,\nuseless feel.  He went to the door, closed it, and though cold and\naching he said to her.  'Please don't lose hope.  I'm going to\nmake it all right for us, somehow.  Some way.  You stood by me these\npast days, and I.....  You are a woman.  I will earn your trust, and\nrepay my debt in full.  I am yours.'\n\nHe embraced her and asked her to lie down in his bed.  He then wrapped\nthe buffalo robe around him, tended the fire, and brought her food and\nwater.  'Sleep,' he told her.  'In comfort and in peace.  I\nfeel a little stronger, but I will do nothing foolish. I must tend the\ntiger's wounds, and if Akar returns with meat, feed us both.  Then\nyou and I will sleep together.  I love you.  Be well in your heart.'\nHe shook off all emotions of weakness and sorrow, and set out to do what\nmust be done.\n\nAkar returned a short time later.  After studying the tiger uncertainly,\nand looking hard at Kalus, he set down his burden, part of a kill stolen\nfrom a badger.  It was not much to look at, but from it Kalus was able\nto carve and cook a pound or two of meat.  He divided portions for all\nthe company, then placed the remainder in a bowl, along with the cooked\nblood, beside the big cat, still unconscious.  He then cleaned, repaired\nand wrapped its wounds as best he could, laying it more comfortably on\nthe floor.  He knew that in taking it among them, and especially in\nbinding one of its limbs, he risked confusing and provoking a creature\ncapable of doing them great harm.  But he had an unspoken faith that it\nwas not yet old and hard enough to hate without reason, or to see as\nenemies all those unlike itself.\n\nNot wishing to squander the unexpected turn of his fortunes, or the\nquiet courage that had risen inside him, he lay down without further\nexposure beside the girl, wrapping the furs thickly around them both.\nWaking, she said in a soft and pleading voice.\n\n'Don't leave me here.  Please don't ever leave me.' He\nanswered without words, holding her close and caressing her tear-stained\nhair.\n\nAgain they had found each other, and Kalus knew that in their bond lay\nthe one real hope of his survival.  She made him want to live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 24\n\n\nWhen the snow tiger woke from its perilous sleep it found cooked meat in\na dish beside it, warmth all around it, and the burning ice gone from\nits fur.  But it also saw strange creatures, an unnatural barrier, and\nthe calculated stare of a wolf.  He tried to lift himself quickly, felt\nsomething catch at his leg.  He was overcome by the same intense\ndizziness, then yielded against his will to the pull of gravity.  He lay\nhelpless on his side, looking at the others with wide-eyed fear and\nuncertainty.\n\n'No one move,' said Kalus, rising cautiously from his seat beside\nthe fire.  Sylviana took hold of the pup, which had begun to growl and\nyap, and silenced it as best she could.  Akar might have been a stone in\nbetween, but for the narrowing fire of his eyes.\n\nKalus moved slowly to the door and opened it.  It was cold and black\noutside, but the wind had subsided.  He began to move carefully towards\nthe tiger.  It growled at him and curled its upper lip, but the great\nhead would not be supported.  It lowered to the earth as before.\n\n'It's all right,' said Kalus reassuringly.  'I won't hurt\nyou.' He took a piece of meat from the bowl, and set it a few inches\nfrom its mouth.  Then feeling the cold, he moved back to the door and\nbegan to close it.  Again, as he thought it might, the tiger reacted.\nIt felt trapped and closed in.  He began to move away, but then thought\nof something else.  Going to the opening, he went outside and brought in\na piece of crusted snow.  This he placed as close to its mouth as he\ndared, then closed the door and returned to his place beside the fire.\n\n'Snow is the most constant part of its existence,' he explained to\nthe girl.  'And I think it needs water even more than food.'\nTogether they watched, hoping for the best.\n\nAs the man-child hovered about it, the tiger's eyes had followed his\nevery movement.  Now it turned its senses, heightened by physical\nextremity and need, toward the objects placed in front of it.\n\nThe big cat hesitated, then reached out its tongue and licked the hard\nsnow.  Again.  Then stretching out his neck, he took the blessed\nsubstance in his teeth and brought it closer.  And chewed off a small\npiece.\n\nKalus smiled quietly, remembering a time not so very long before, when\nhe had shared his meat with Akar.  And this time there was no one to\nangrily question his will, or rebuke him for showing compassion.  This\nin turn gave him a cautious feeling of pride and independence.  He\nlooked around him, seeming to remember that all of this was now his, and\nthat if he could but live to see it, the world still held much for him.\nIn that swift moment of emotion, he felt an almost exaggerated desire\ncoursing through his limbs, as if in compensation for his illness.  His\nthoughts returned to find the girl watching him, eyes glistening.  She\nspoke.\n\n'You're thinking that you finally have something to call your\nown.'\n\n'YES.  How did you know?'\n\n'Because.....  I've been waiting since I've known you to see\nthat look.  To see you look at ME.  Don't you know what you have?'\nAt that moment the tiger, seeming to revive a little, stretched forward\nand rolled one forepaw beneath its head, and with a last glance at the\nothers, began to study the proffered meat more closely.  As Kalus looked\non, understanding at the last, it took the first piece in its jaws,\nchewed tentatively, then swallowed.\n\n'Yes, Sylviana.  I have hope.' As the tiger moved itself weakly\nover the bowl and began to eat, he wrapped the fur up around his eyes,\novercome.\n\n'I love you,' was all he could manage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 25\n\n\nSylviana rose the next morning to find Kalus standing in the open\ndoorway, looking out across the snow.  The big cat had somehow gained\nits feet, and lumbered toward him uncertainly.  She started to warn him,\nkeeping her voice down only with an effort.  But when he turned towards\nher, his eyes were calm.  He took a step back and away from the\nentrance, and the tiger soon stood in his place.  Its gaze moved back\nand forth between the Wild and the man.  Clearly it was not much\nrecovered.  Unable to maintain the effort, it slid down to an unnatural\nsitting position, with the bandaged leg splayed wildly.  It let out a\ngrowl of pain, and struggled to rise again.  Succeeding only partially,\nit clawed and clutched its way out into the snow.  From there it could\ngo no further, and lay where it had fallen, pulling itself to a more\nnatural position and breathing heavily.  Kalus said something in a\nsteady voice, then reentered and closed the door.\n\n'Won't he die out there?' asked the girl.\n\n'No.  Not from the cold at least.  He's so hurt and confused, I\nwanted him to know at least that he is free.' He came closer, and she\nsaw that he was shivering.  She put another fur around his shoulders and\nmade him sit by the fire, which she then repaired.\n\n'He means a lot to you, doesn't he?'\n\n'Yes.  Perhaps even more than Akar did to you.'\n\nShe sat beside him.  'How do you mean?'\n\n'In him I see myself, and I can love.....  It's not his fault that\nhe's helpless now.  He's only trying to survive, friendless and\nlost.'\n\n'But you're not friendless.'\n\n'I know.'\n\nShe saw that he wrestled with strong emotions, and said no more.  At\nlength he took her hand, kissed it, and asked her.\n\n'If Akar is not successful today. . .or even if he is.  Could you go\nto the second reserve again?'\n\n'Yes.  But why, if Akar brings us meat?'\n\n'He hunts for you, myself until I am better, and the cub.  That is\nburden enough.  Please believe it is best.  The tiger needs meat, and he\nmust take it from me.' Again, though she did not understand, she knew\nthat deep currents were at work in him.\n\nA short time later Akar did return, carrying in his mouth some kind of\nfield-bird.  As Kalus let him in the wolf took it not to the girl, as\nwas his custom (he had not even acknowledged the man-child's\npresence), but instead went to a corner by himself and lay down with it,\nplucking out the feathers with his teeth, and eating as if he were alone\nin the chamber.  The pup, upon waking, jumped down from the woman's\nbed and approached him, her tail wagging in eager solicitation.  He did\nnot rebuff her, but made her wait until he had eaten his fill.  Then he\nrose and went out again, passing Sylviana without gesture or affection,\nbristling slightly as he drew a sullen half-circle past the tiger.  The\nwoman closed the door again, confused.\n\n'What was that all about? What was he trying to say?'\n\n'Something he's been telling us for weeks, since the death of\nKamela, and before.'\n\n'What?' She knew, deep down.\n\n'That he must leave us soon.  That his place is with the pack, his\nreal kindred.  They need him now as much as we do.  I think that only\nhis shoulder---'\n\n'It's not TRUE.' She sat down on the floor, a forlorn bundle in\na world made suddenly colder.  'He wouldn't leave us like\nthis.' She tried to rationalize, arguing with whom she did not know.\n'You're not able to hunt.'\n\n'No, but I will be soon, with as much chance as he.  And you can live\non sebreum.'\n\n'But Alaska,' she insisted (the name she had given the pup).\n\n'He knows I will not let her starve.  I'm sorry, Sylviana.  But\nhis place is with his own kind.'\n\n'It's not fair.' Her eyes would not stop filling.\n\nKalus picked up the fur she had discarded, and gently replaced it around\nher shoulders.  He put his hand on her head shyly, feeling unworthy, and\nunable to do more.  But beneath his breath he made this vow.\n\n'So long as there is life inside me, you will never be alone.'\n\nHe moved away, unable to face the apparition of Winter's resistance\nto his life and to his dreams.  To love so deeply, and with so little\nhope.....\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus fed the tiger with the reserves the woman-child brought him.  Akar\nreturned at nightfall and she spent the night beside him, crying softly,\nand loving more than ever the friend she feared to lose.  He did not\nresist her.\n\nKalus slept alone, vowing again and again his devotion, fearing to hear\nhimself speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 26\n\n\nThe next morning Akar rose early, and in the darkness of first morning,\nstood above the sleeping form of his mistress.  Her soft breathing, the\nsmell of her.....  He would not have believed he could feel so much.\nAnd as the light grew slowly, calling him away, still he remained there,\nwistful and sad, wishing only there was some way to tell her.  At last\nshe stirred, reaching out for him in a troubled dream.  Not finding him\nshe sat up quickly, fearing he had already gone.\n\nShe saw him, and sank back into herself.  She began to cry, feeling\ntheir imminent parting as only a woman can.  She covered her eyes,\nashamed of her weakness and unable to face him.\n\nThis was too much for him.  Knowing no other gesture, no longer caring\nif he betrayed himself by emotion, the wolf pushed at the arm with his\nsnout, and as she lowered it in surprise, nestled his forehead against\nher.  She said his name, embracing him and pouring out her heart.  All\nthe pain of this new world, all the loneliness and fear, found outlet\nand meaning in his love, which now she clearly felt.\n\nAnd at length as she released him, she felt drained but no longer empty\nand wounded.  A breach had been mended in her soul by his sudden\nexpression of warmth, and though Akar might have said it differently, he\nfelt much the same.  Stepping back, he gestured toward Kalus'\nsleeping place, then reluctantly, toward the door.  Understanding, she\ngot up and ascended the steps of the dais, pulling aside the patchwork\nof furs and waking the man-child.\n\nHe was not asleep, nor had been for some time.  But he played the part\nassigned to him, feigning ignorance of what had stirred him to the root.\n\n'Akar has to leave,' she said quietly.  'He wanted to say\ngoodbye.'\n\nKalus stepped out from the low shelter and went to bid farewell to his\nfriend.  He went down on one knee before him, and looked into his eyes.\nThere was no need for words between them.  Both had given life to the\nother, and would do so again.  No debt was owed or felt, only the bond\nof true allies, and their common love for the woman-child, which no\nwords could express.  Still, Kalus felt moved to make some sign.  He\nreached over and touched her throat, then said with his hands:\n\n'With my life.' Understanding, the wolf simply lowered his head in\nacknowledgment.  Then he gestured toward the door.\n\n'I guess he really has to go,' said Sylviana.  Again she embraced\nand caressed him, so reluctant now to let go.  Then straightened\nresolutely and went to the door.  She opened it herself, and without\nfurther ceremony he went out into the Wild, leaving a stream of memories\nbehind him.\n\nThe young man and woman remained silent in the doorway, watching him\ndisappear slowly into a mist of half-lit snow, lost in thought.  Because\nthey realized that a page had been turned in their lives, just as one\nday their lives would end and the book continue.  And feeling this to\nits depths, all veils torn aside, they knew what it was to be human.\nSylviana recalled the poignant line from the Shakespeare sonnet:\n\n'To love that which you fear to lose.'\n\nThen their thoughts once more focused on each other.\n\n\n*\n\n\n'You're not going to try to hunt today?' Kalus had begun to\ndress heavily, and even now wrapped the sword-belt around him.  Though\nhis eyes were determined, as they had been on the day of Kamela's\ndeath, there was something in his manner that was not at all the same.\nHe was less tense, and his breathing more regular.  Small comfort that\nit was.  'You're in no condition.'\n\n'No, but I've been thinking.  Last winter I tried setting traps,\ndifferent kinds for different animals.  They do not bring in large game,\nbut are more.....  I don't know how to say it.  Less aggressive and\ndangerous.  And with the reserves almost gone, we must live one day at a\ntime.  I do not like living without some cushion, no matter how small,\nespecially when it is not my life alone I have to think of.  But I have\ndone it before, and never failed utterly.  Fear and despair are my\nenemies now.'\n\n'It's good to hear you say that, Kalus, it really is.  There's\nonly one thing wrong with that whole line of reasoning.'\n\n'What's that?'\n\n'Don't misunderstand me.  I feel for the tiger, too, and I want\nhim to survive.  But how can you possibly feed him and us too?  He must\neat more than the three of us put together.  Akar was right in that, at\nleast.'\n\n'I don't misunderstand, but there is something I haven't told\nyou.  I think Akar knew it also.  It is part of the reason he left when\nhe did.  Two males, natural competitors---there would have been friction\nbetween them.'\n\n'You've lost me.'\n\n'Well.  It is true that the first and deepest thing I feel for the\ntiger is compassion.  But if that was all I felt, I would not take him\namong us.  Love cannot exist without survival.'\n\n'Then why?'\n\n'I take a small chance in feeding him, and treating his wounds.  You\nhave seen that I make it a point to feed him myself.  I am not being\nentirely unselfish. I know something of the ways of his kind.'\n\n'Go on.'\n\n'You see, they do not live in packs like the wolves, or with their\nmates like the saber-toothed cats.  But they are not completely alone,\neither.  They coexist, if that is the right word, and keep loose contact\nwith others of their kind.'\n\n'Yes,' said Sylviana, beginning to understand.  'I remember\nsomething about that from zoology.  They're a much more social animal\nthan was first believed.' He nodded, though the words were unknown to\nhim.\n\n'So you see, since this one is still young, and has lost touch with\nhis kindred---or he would not have come so far to the east---it is not\nimpossible that since I shared my meat with him, he would do the same\nfor me.  He would not bring it here, any more than one tiger would take\nits kill to another.  But if another comes on the scene, they are\nwilling to share.  And Sylviana, never have you seen such a Wintertime\nhunter.'\n\nOnce more she began to feel a quiet respect for his experience, and\nknowledge of his world.\n\n'But how long before he's able to hunt?'\n\n'He is young and strong, and unless I misread him, very determined.\nThere are no broken bones.  Perhaps ten days, perhaps twenty.  In any\ncase, you see that I cannot let him die.'\n\n'Yes.' She squeezed his arm, seeing that he was about to\ngo. 'Be careful.'\n\n'Yes.  I will take the wolf.  It is time she learned of the world\nbeyond these walls.'\n\nIt felt strange to her to hear him speak of the pup as a wolf.  She\nherself called it Alaska, and he had always before used pseudonyms such\nas \u0091cub' or \u0091pup'.  But looking at her now, standing and\nwatching them quizzically, she saw that the slight creature Kamela had\nbrought them, was indeed a babe no longer.  Her limbs had begun to grow\nlong, ahead of the body, and her gaze, though still childish, was\ngrowing keener and more aware.  And she remembered that this was in fact\na wolf, and not a dog.\n\n'When you come back, will you tell me why Akar didn't take her\nwith him?  If you know.  I have an idea, but I'd like to know what\nyou think.'\n\n'When I return, I will be glad to speak of it.' He became suddenly\nshy.  'And to be with you.' He went to the door, called to the\ncub, and went out.  Sylviana closed the door behind them.\n\nHis thoughts being thus absorbed, Kalus did not realize until he reached\nthe end of the ledge and saw the broad, irregular tracks leading\ndownward, that the tiger was gone.  At first this upset him, both for\nhis sake and its own.  But as he entered the ravine and began to\nmentally prepare for the lands beyond, he had no choice but to let it\ngo.  It was beyond his control.\n\n'So be it.' But this did not keep him from noting that its tracks\nwent southward down the gorge, and that if they rose again to left or\nright, it was beyond the edge of his sight.\n\nThe cub stayed close to him instinctively, and they made their way first\nup the steep slope, then out across the rolling white and camel-hair\nlands.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus returned to the gorge as the sky grew dark and ominous.  There was\nno sign of the tiger, and his own time in the cold had been devoured.\nHe shivered and coughed in the growing wind, and the voices of caution\nwould not be gainsaid.  The rules of this new affliction he had learned\nthe hard way.  The rules of the Cold World he knew by heart.  And as he\nlingered a moment, straining his senses for any sight or sound, even the\ncub seemed anxious, looking about it and at the threatening sky.\n\n'All right,' he said gruffly, as much to the nameless as to\nanyone.  'Chase me back into my hole again.  Tomorrow I'll be\nback.' He gained the ledge, and the doorway beyond.\n\nSylviana greeted him with an embrace that surprised him.  He had not\nexpected it, for one thing, and had forgotten how much this simple\ncontact was worth.  And he remembered too, for all the day's\nfrustrations, his deep affection for her.  If only he could bring them\nall to some safe place.....\n\n'Are you well?' he asked her.\n\n'Well enough, now.  I don't like the look of that sky, though, or\nthe sudden drop in temperature.  I'm worried about Akar.'\n\n'And I for the tiger.  He's gone off, you know.'\n\n'Yes.  I'm sorry.'\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders unconvincingly.  'There's nothing I can\ndo about it now.  I couldn't make him a prisoner.'\n\nHe took off his warm wrappings, refitted the one-piece garment, then sat\ndown on the steps of the altar and began sharpening his sword.  But all\nat once he cast away the whet-stone, a hard and bitter edge on all his\nfeatures.\n\n'It's not fair,' he said.  'I wanted him to live.....  I\nwanted him to be my friend.'\n\nSylviana studied him wordlessly, touched and taken back, as ever, by the\npower of his primal emotions.  And when he looked up at her, she saw\nagain the restless and hungry expression that so haunted her.  She\nturned away, drawn to him as on a chain, yet afraid.  Why did he move\nher so?\n\n'I didn't want to lose Akar, either.  Sometimes if you love\nsomeone, you have to let them go.' Now it was she who was\nunconvincing.  And all at once, he wanted her.\n\nKalus rose, all his sorrows and reawakened desires now focused with\ntotal singularity upon the object, the living being of his love.  He\nmoved closer, and took her by the shoulders, and turned her towards him.\nThere was nothing else in all the world.\n\n'I want to make love to you.'\n\nHe kissed her, and stripped away the barriers between them, and touched\nher with the roots of his being, overflowing like a well-spring upon the\nearth.  She had not the strength to resist him, and soon lost all desire\nto do so.  He led her to his bed, and together they breathed deeper air\nthan they had for many days.\n\n\n*\n\n\nLater that night, as they slept side by side, Kalus dreamed that he rode\nacross a vast expanse on the back of a great horse, its silver mane\nflying in the wind of its speed.  Then as the sun set the land became\ndark and he walked alone, till in the dense and shadowed underbrush\nthere was a rustle of movement, and a great cat called his name.\n\nAnd waking, he heard the sound again.  He pulled aside the patchwork of\nfurs and moved across the room, afraid the sound would fade into\nunreality.  He threw a log quickly on the dying fire, and went to the\ndoor.  And opened it.\n\nThe snow tiger stood before him, a fierce storm howling all around\nit. Leg bleeding and weak from hunger, it remained motionless.  But\nstill it stood, and wanted to come in.\n\n'What is it?' asked his lover, peering out from the canopy of\nstone.\n\n'A miracle,' he pronounced, blinded by the water in his eyes and\nin his heart.  'The tiger has come back.' It lumbered in woozily,\nand he closed the door behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 27\n\n\nThus began a period of relative calm for the reshaped company.  Slowly\nthe tiger's wounds healed, and slowly, as he became wiser and more\nproficient at setting them, Kalus' traps became more productive.  The\nreserves were emptied and there was never much to spare.  Their\nexistence was strictly one day at a time, and face tomorrow when it\ncomes.  But what was absolutely needed, the bare-bone necessities, were\nthrough constant effort and exertion, one way or another obtained.\n\nAnd though Winter was hardly on the wane, neither could it increase or\noutdo the storms it had already hurled against them.  The fortress they\nhad made of Skither's cave, as well as the yet dearer fortresses of\nmind and body, continued to withstand and endure.  And their collective\nwill remained unvanquished.\n\nAnd in late afternoons and evenings, when the day's work was done and\nnothing more could be bought by their labors, there was time for\nreading, conversation and quiet thought.  The tiger, once it learned it\nwas free to do so, often went out into the night, if only to rest just\nbeyond the safety of the lair; and this, along with Akar's absence,\nleft a natural void which must be filled with more human pursuits.  Even\nthe cub would turn peaceful, either tired out by the day's doings, or\nengaged in some quiet pursuit of its own, chewing at a bone or piece of\nleather, or simply working out in dream the wonders and perils of its\nworld.\n\nFor Sylviana it was both comforting and painful to recall herself\nthrough books, and to reveal to Kalus for the first time, the beauty and\ntorment of Man's elevated walk upon the Earth.  That it should now be\nall but extinguished was to her an unspeakable and inexpressible\ntragedy.  Yet she had learned from Ursula LeGuin years before (though at\nthe time she had not understood it), that the only way to deal with the\nhorror of a shattered past was to face it, and call it by its true name.\nAnd she told herself that in her heart, if nowhere else, lived the\nmemory of much that was noble and good.\n\nFor Kalus the various narratives, histories and philosophies, continued\nto open a whole new world before him.  And though it was at times a\npleasant and enlightening escape, on the whole his reactions to modern\nsociety were not unlike the woman's first impressions of the violent\nworld outside their door.  It held wonders, yes, and on occasion,\nprofound beauty and wisdom.  But the accounts of civil war, totalitarian\nregimes, torture, famine, real and effectual slavery, environmental\npollution and industrial greed, excited in him the same horror that the\nimagined swarm of giant ants had once roused in Sylviana.\n\nSometimes these responses troubled her, and she felt called upon to\ncorrect his deficiencies in perspective and defend her race.  But at\nother times his naive and disbelieving comments cut frighteningly close\nto the truth.  He accepted and took for granted none of the vast\npretenses and self-important doctrines in which humanity clothed itself,\nand was therefore able to see a larger picture, or certainly a different\none, than that which she was accustomed to.\n\nFor to him Man was not the only, or even the most important species on\nthe planet, let alone the center of the Universe, and sole concern of\nthe Nameless.  It was perhaps for this reason that he had not been\nshocked when Sylviana told him that the Earth revolved around the Sun,\nand not the other way around, or that the stars were themselves suns,\nparenting similar worlds of their own.  To him Man was not the separate\ncreation of a God unhappy or impatient with Nature.  To his mind, if she\nunderstood him correctly, evolution was quite miraculous enough, and\nbrought him closer to, rather than farther from, believing in a\nUniversal being.  And he assured her that nearly every animal was\ncapable of some measure of thought and feeling, as real and meaningful\nto its existence, as the painful dreams and aspirations of men.\n\nAt first he offered few opinions of his own, only gut-level reactions\nwhen they would not be silenced, which the woman-child must then\ndecipher on her own.  Not only did he feel unqualified to do so---the\nvery word \u0091philosophy' intimidated him, seeming a thing reserved\nfor larger and more important persons---but also, some other sense told\nhim that it was unwise to speak or pass judgment upon things he did not\nfully understand.\n\nBut after a time, having whole days to mull over what he had learned\n(when hunting, trapping and working did not require his full attention),\nhe began to speak and question at a level which surprised her.  Not only\nwould she have believed him incapable of such subtle thought and\ninquiry, but she had always assumed that he would consider such pursuits\nfrivolous, and beside the immediate point of survival.  Such was not the\ncase.  His mind and spirit hungered, just as the body did, to be\nnourished and fulfilled.  And in some ways this spiritual hunger was\nmore acute, since it had been so long denied.\n\nHis two favorite writer/philosophers, to judge by the number of times he\nasked her to read them, were Ernest Hemingway and Lao Tsu.  And this\napparent contradiction puzzled her.  She could not imagine two more\ndirectly opposed outlooks, or approaches to life.  But when she asked\nhim about this, he answered more simply and clearly than she would have\nbelieved possible.  It was a cold night, but warm beside the fire,\nsomewhere near the apex of winter.  Even the tiger remained indoors,\nsleeping in its accustomed place just inside the barrier.  The cub\nrested quietly beside the man-child, while he gently stroked her chest\nand side.  Life was all around him, and he felt it deeply.\n\n'I think that the two ways, if I can call them that, are just the two\nsides of a man's life: like day and night, summer and winter.  They\nboth spring from the fountainhead of Life, both are necessary; they only\nseem different, as Lao Tsu said.  He understood the need to yield to\nNature, and Hemingway the need to fight back.  They make me think of\nSkither and Barabbas.  There are times when one is right, and times when\nthe other---'\n\n'To everything there is a season,' she broke in suddenly,\nunderstanding and taken back by the apparent ease with which he had\narrived at one of man's profoundest insights.  'And a time to\nevery purpose under Heaven.'\n\nUpon hearing this he became so animated, and insisted so fervently that\nshe read to him the entire passage from which this was taken, that\ndespite misgivings she brought out a tattered Gideon's Bible and read\nto him the verses from Ecclesiastes.\n\n\n*\n\n\n'To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under\nthe heaven:\n\nA time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to\npluck up that which is planted; A time to kill, and a time to heal; a\ntime to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep, and a time\nto laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; A time to cast away\nstones, and a time to gather stones together; A time to embrace, and a\ntime to refrain from embracing; A time to get, and a time to lose; a\ntime to keep, and a time to cast away; A time to rend, and a time to\nsew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; A time to love, and a\ntime to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.'\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus was awe-struck.  'Are all the things in that book as true and\nwise?' he asked.  'Who is its author?'\n\nThis was exactly what she feared.  More than one newly opened and\nvulnerable heart had fallen into the trap of blind acceptance of this,\nand other religious works.  Whether Christianity was the true faith or\nnot, whether one true faith existed, was not the point.  The religious\ndoctrines of humanity were simply too broad and powerful to impart to\none in his position: sensitive, struggling and searching.  And in this\nshe showed wisdom or her own.\n\n'I'm afraid not, Kalus.  And it doesn't have one author, it has\nmany.  There are people who believed everything in it to be the truth,\nsuppressing all other voices, even to the point of overriding their own\nexperience and common sense.  But I'm not one of them.'\n\n'There are really people who would do that?  Contradict the lessons\nthat Nature has taught them?  I don't understand.'\n\n'That's because you don't know what was at stake to them, or\nhow deep such feelings run.'\n\n'What do you mean?'\n\n'I'm afraid I can't say it in just a few words, and I don't\nwant to try.  If you really want to learn about different religions,\nI'll teach you what I can.  But it really should be done slowly.  Or\nyou could be hurt.' She spoke now from first-hand experience.\n\nHe was silent for a time, his thought roused and his curiosity almost\nunbearable.  But he too had learned caution, and he respected her\njudgment.  One last question.\n\n'Can you tell me one thing at least?  How could any book make a man\nnot listen to his heart?'\n\nShe took a deep breath.  'Well.  What if I told you that you could\nlive forever, and never be separated from the ones you love.\nWouldn't that make you willing to listen, and learn how if you\ncould?'\n\n'Of course!  But no one lives forever.....  DO THEY?' The gleam in\nhis eyes was unmistakable.\n\n'No one knows, Kalus.  And that's why men cling to religion.\nThat, and the desire to do good.  But that's enough for tonight,\nreally.  All right?'\n\nAt first her words had no effect, then.  'Yes,' he answered\nabsently.  For his mind was submerged in questions that had drowned far\nmore learned souls than his.\n\nIn the coming battle he retained only one advantage.  His life had been\ntoo hard, the beginnings of his dreams too dearly bought, to be long\ndeceived and pacified by illusions.  His feet were too painfully aware\nof the road beneath them, and his hands too calloused from the Herculean\nlabors of survival.\n\nBut this could not protect him from Fear, when cast in this new,\nmetaphysical light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 28\n\n\nSeveral days, perhaps a week, passed in much the same outward manner.\nBut Sylviana, with her now practiced eye, began to observe a subtle\nchange in him, and this troubled her.  Always now when his attention was\nnot required for some physical task, his eyes and mind seemed to rove\nabout him, as if expecting the walls to come suddenly to life and undo\nhim.  She began to fear that despite all her caution she had given him\ntoo much to think about, too many questions to grapple with.  And she\nwondered what hidden Pandora's box she had opened inside him.\n\nHer concern was well justified, and her guesses not far from the truth.\nTwo things had occurred simultaneously which had made him very\nuneasy. And in his mind, once more isolated, they seemed indelibly\nlinked, a kind of hard message from the nameless God, which he must\nunravel and accept.\n\nThe first thing that troubled him was the rebound of harsh winter\nweather.  For a time the days had turned relatively mild, and he had\nsecretly hoped that the worst was passed.  But his optimism was\npremature.  The Cold World was a long way from spent.\n\nThe second occurrence, inevitable though it might have been, was the\ndiscovery, real or imagined, of a spiritual world to parallel the\nphysical.  Always before the wind had been simply wind, the sun, sun,\nand his environment, with its natural currents and disturbances, just\nand only that.  If forced to give a name to these patterns and fluxes of\nlife and death, he would merely have said \u0091Nature', or \u0091the\nways of the Valley'.\n\nBut with the introduction of religion into his thoughts and\nobservations, came its often inseparable counterpart: superstition.  Was\nthere an intelligence behind the winds and storms around him, the\ndangers and trials of his world?  For if so, clearly they bore him no\ngood intention, and possibly considerable malice.  Why now, when he was\nhurting and most needed mild weather, was he confronted by the harshest\nWinter he had ever experienced?\n\nBut this was just the tip of the iceberg.  If there truly was a God,\nthen why the innumerable and inexplicable tragedies of his life, both\ngreat and small?  And most poignant of all to him: WHY WAS SHAMA DEAD?\nAll the other deaths and injuries he had known could perhaps, with an\neffort, be rationalized.  But why a mere child, healthy and intelligent,\nwith his whole life ahead of him?\n\nHe did not forget the other miracles of his life: the fact that he had\nbeen born at all, that he had survived the many pitfalls of his\nexistence, and come against considerable odds to find the woman-child,\nwhom he loved.  He remembered the Voice, but could not make its words\ncorrespond to those of the Bible.\n\nAnd why, now, did he feel as if some tangible force resisted and sought\nto undo him?  What was his sin?  Was it because he refused, out of\nignorance, to acknowledge the power and supremacy of the one true God?\nIf he obeyed His rules and precepts, would He then smile upon him, and\nmake his life more bearable?  And the final nail, as it always has been,\nwas the burning question that neither Sylviana, nor anyone or anything\nelse could answer for him.  Was the spirit eternal, and if so, was there\na way to come to paradise after death, and be reunited with the ones he\nloved?\n\nIt was for him a crushing burden, feeling that his decision, his answer\nto God, held the key not only to his own spiritual salvation, but to\nthat of those he loved more than his own life.  It was for this reason\nthat he could not open his heart to Sylviana.  She did not believe; she\nhad said so.  But what if she was wrong?  Surely if such a being\nexisted, He must be obeyed and appeased. God the Father.  Was he then\nlike Barabbas, a stern and forceful leader?\n\nIt was all too much for him.  How could he, an ignorant hunter and\ntrapper, come to grips with the maker of the stars?  Perhaps God was\nright to curse him and laugh at him.  He was small, foolish and evil.\n\nKalus was on the verge of despair.  His body would not heal, and the\nCold World would not relent.  How much longer could he trick himself\ninto going on, when he was eternally being resisted and punished because\nof his ignorance?\n\nIt was a cold and cheerless night, as he climbed slowly up out of the\ngorge with his meager prize: a small rabbit, that by some fluke had not\ndied immediately in his snare, but had to be killed after hours of\ntorment and fear.  He had all but decided that he could no longer live\nthis way, that he must hunt as a man or perish.  But even this small\ndignity was not afforded him, since still the others must eat.\n\nHe stepped back onto the ledge with the cub beside him.  The tiger was\ngone.  He knocked wearily on the door, his body aching, and after a\nshort time which seemed far longer, Sylviana opened it.  Her face was\nfull of concern, but he had not the strength to pretend that things were\nbetter than they were.\n\nHe cooked the rabbit without a word, and divided out the portions.  The\nthree ate silently, and even the cub seemed subdued, sensing her\nmaster's mood. Kalus placed the tiger's share outside the door,\nwrapped his fur tighter, and sat like a troubled stone before the fire.\nSylviana could stand it no longer.\n\n'Kalus, what is it?  What's wrong?'\n\n'I can't talk about it,' he said.  'I'm sorry.'\n\n'Why are you shutting me out again?'\n\n'Sylviana, please.' Her tone changed when she saw his eyes.  Pain\nshe had seen in them, and anger.  Even resignation to death.  But this\npleading, tearful sorrow, as if his spirit was cornered and in\ntorment.....\n\n'It's all right,' she said softly, kneeling beside him.  She\nwanted to comfort him with caresses and kind words, but something held\nher back.  Better to let the dam burst on its own.\n\n'Well, can we talk about something else?'\n\n'If you like.' He mastered himself, became calm.\n\n'You never told me about the wolves: why Kamela was so bitter, and\nwhy Akar left the cub behind.' Here, he thought, was a chance to\nescape his own feelings.\n\n'It's a long story,' he began, 'And many parts I don't\nknow for certain.  But from things I have learned, and from things I\nknew before, I think I can tell you this much.' He shifted positions,\ntrying to lessen the discomfort in the small of his back.\n\n'For Kamela, I believe her tragedy was two-fold.  First, if I read\nthe signs right---I knew something of the pack before the coming of the\nChanged One---I believe that Akar was her first love.  He had chosen her\nto be his mate, and she him.\n\n'But the pack must be ruled by a single master, and that master,\nAkar's brother, had also chosen her.  There are many things a leader\nmust consider, and emotion is not the first concern of wolves.  Shaezar\nclaimed her, and she yielded to his will.\n\n'Akar could not, would not cross his brother, but he was deeply hurt.\nIn bitterness he left the pack for a time, and it was then that Shar-hai\nmade his move.  He killed Shaezar, fairly or unfairly, and took his\nplace as leader.  For Akar the result was true banishment, and\nunforgiving self-reproach.  For Kamela.....  Shar-hai must have made her\nlife a living Hell.  You have seen the long scar on her underside.'\n\n'NO.' She spoke truly.\n\n'She did her best to hide it.....  I believe that she was brutally\nraped, probably more than once.  Also, it is very rare to have only one\ncub.  I think that Shar-hai and his guard must have killed the others.\nHe let Alaska live because she was no threat to him, and might provide\nfurther amusement.'\n\n'My God, that's awful.'\n\n'Yes.  That is why she was not afraid to die.  She still loved Akar,\nof that I am sure.  And he loved her.  But she could never overcome the\nshadow that was left on her soul. You cross a line, Sylviana. . .and\neverything becomes so black.'\n\nShe sensed that he was close to breaking.  But for all her pity, she\nknew what she must do.  One last push.\n\n'But why did Akar leave the cub with us?  It seems so cruel.'\n\nHis eyes flamed at this.  'The true wolves do nothing out of cruelty.\nIt was for her own safety, and to leave a part of himself with you.'\nHe got up and began to pace, an uncontrollable rage rising inside him.\n'CRUEL?' he fumed, throwing off the fur like an unwanted burden,\nand waving his arms as if struggling in a net.  'I'll tell you\nwhat's cruel.....\n\n'Skither lives his whole life, an unselfish warrior for the good, and\ndies by violence far from his home.  Kamela does what is expected of\nher, Akar does what he feels in his heart, and both are punished and\nbereft.  An eight year old boy---' He wept.  'An eight year old\nboy, Sylviana, makes the one mistake of his life.....  And he is KILLED\nfor it.  While your God.....' All at once he let out a roar.\n\n'WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!' he shouted at the walls.\n'What gives you the right to make hard rules, and pass out life and\ndeath in judgment?  You are not wise, you are not strong.  YOU ARE NOT\nGOD!  I reject this fear!  I reject this lie!  I will not serve the\nfearful creation of MEN!'\n\nAnd suddenly the burden was lifted.  He stood shaking, his face wet.\nBut in that brief moment when the life inside him had shouted back at\nthe Night, rejecting it and all its works, he was free, and once more\ntrue to himself, to the God that was in him.  His doubts remained, but\nhe would not follow that tortured path one step further.\n\nSylviana went to him and embraced him, this time without reservation.\nHis grateful arms wrapped around her.  He dried his eyes against her\nneck and shoulder, then stepped back, looking down.\n\n'I'm sorry,' he said.  'I feel as if I've condemned us\nall.'\n\n'Or saved us.  Don't you see?'\n\n'But if you don't believe, and I don't.....'\n\n'I never said I didn't believe in God, Kalus.  I just don't\nbelieve in religion.  Faith is about Faith.  Religion is about\ncontrol.'\n\n'But---'\n\n'Listen to me, Kalus.  You don't have to punish yourself to\nbelieve in something positive, something larger than yourself.  You\ndon't have to choose between Hells.'\n\n'But the Bible---'\n\n'Was written, translated, and ALTERED by men.  Saint Paul may have\nbeen a good man, but he never ever met Jesus; and I believe that\n\u0091Saints' Jerome and Augustine distorted Christ's words almost\nbeyond recognition.  Between them, and with lots of help from the\nCatholic Church---Jesus never said anything about chastity, or that the\nbodies God gave us were inherently evil---they set loose a fear of\ndevils and damnation that was the scourge of the western world for two\nthousand years: from the slaughters of Charlemagne, to the Inquisition\nand the Holocaust.\n\n'\u0091You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.'\nTHAT'S what Jesus said, and THAT'S what I believe.  There is truth\neverywhere---in Shakespeare, in Dickens, in YOU.  You know as much as\nanyone, about your own life, infinitely more.' She softened, and put\na hand to his cheek.  'Trust your heart, Kalus.  That's what\nit's there for.'\n\nHe looked into her eyes, and the light of day came back to him.  'You\nare very wise.  I should have come to you sooner.'\n\n'Some lessons we have to learn for ourselves.  You taught me\nthat.'\n\n'Do you think.....' He struggled again, before the question that\nlay behind all others.  'Do you think that you could ever. . .love\nme, Sylviana?'\n\n'I'm beginning to think I could.  Now go wash off that grime, and\nI'll show you.'\n\n'Aren't you afraid---'\n\n'Tonight you have to be afraid of me.  Now go wash yourself, before I\ndo it for you.'\n\nHe went to the basin, and as the water splashed across him, felt both\nbody and spirit cleansed.  From here forward, he vowed, he would choose\nlife over spiritual death, love over fear.  This life was the only one\nhe knew, his mind and heart the only guides he would ever have in it.\nAnd as he half-tearfully dried himself, he felt moved as he rarely had\nbeen.  He went down on his knees, clutched his hands before him, and\nsaid to the nameless God.\n\n'Thank you for my life.'\n\nAgain the two made love, and for Kalus the beauty and release were no\nless than on their first such communion.  Sylviana knew only warmth and\npleasure and affection, and as she drew him near, rejoiced to feel the\nlife and strength that were in him, even now.\n\nAnd in the heart and essence of their love, was the essence of true God:\nthe Universal, and unnamable spirit within all Life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 29\n\n\nThe tiger padded silently through the forest, eyes and ears keen for any\nsign of game.  The hunger in his stomach drove him, as well as the\nhunger of his heart.  His hind leg, he knew, was not up to an extended\nchase.  But stalk he could, and hunt he must.  The man-child fed him and\ngave him shelter, but more and more his restlessness grew.  For he was a\ncreature of the wild forests, and he heard their primal call.  Even now,\namidst the cover of thickening pine and mottled oak, he felt yet too\nexposed, and longed to plunge into some limitless wood where clearing\nand field were the exception, and not the rule.  Such a place had once\nbeen his home, and must be again.\n\nA black bear he had already passed, but this was neither prey nor foe.\nIf it had confronted him he would have fought it, and almost surely have\nwon.  Yet he was glad when it saw him coming and moved away.  This\nforest was not his: there was no need to stake a claim.  And seeing it\nhe recalled his fight with the grizzly, when in youthful ignorance he\nhad stood his ground against a more powerful foe, then been a step too\nslow, or too proud, in retreating.\n\nIt had nearly cost him his life, as wounded and almost lame he had been\npursued by the raging beast for miles on end.  In his crippled state he\ncould barely keep ahead of it, and this seemed to goad it on.  Till at\nlast he gained an unknown, freezing river and half stumbled, half swam\nhis way across it.  Even now the sounds of cracking ice, the final break\nand splash into the death-like waters, swimming desperately, clawing out\nagain and scrambling forward.....  Without his broad, padded feet to\nspread his weight upon the ice, without his clinging claws, alive with\nthe frightened desire of youth, he would surely have perished.\n\nBut now that the brush with death was past, he was not afraid.  Those\nwho learned fear from such a trial quickly lost the will they needed to\nlive.  Those who learned caution and still greater determination, these\nwere the hunters, the great cats who survived.\n\nComing to the crest of a long hill, he looked down upon a gentle valley,\nat the center of which lay a clearing along both sides of a swirling\nstream.  Just at the edge of it on the far shore, beyond which the\nforests rose once more to dominate, stood a tall buck and his troop,\nthree females and their half-grown young.  Engaged in eating bark and\npawing through the snow for saplings, at that distance and with their\neyes they could not have seen him.\n\nImmediately he crouched, and in his wordless way, formed a plan.  The\nwind blew from right to left, with the stream, and to cross it\nsilently.....  He snaked out of sight among the trees, and began to\ndescend at an angle to his left.  Coming to a place where the stream\nbent towards him, he followed it a short way further, then quickly and\nquietly waded across.  He heard the buck sing out as he reached the\nfarther shore and scrambled up, and feared that his chance was lost.\nBut stubbornly he dove among the trees and made his swift, circling way\ntowards the spot.\n\n>From ahead of him now came the sounds of conflict, a muted knocking and\n scraping of antlers and the angry, conch-like cries of the bull.\n Drawing hard upon the clearing he discovered the reason.  It was not\n because of him that the herd-leader had spoken in warning.  Another\n buck, younger but nearly equal in girth, had come upon him, and thought\n to steal away his harem. In this he was premature, since neither doe\n nor female fawn would be ready to mate until Spring.  But such mistakes\n are often made, born of the cold and bitter isolation of a solitary\n male in Winter.\n\nNature plays no favorites, nor does the hungry predator.  The females\nhad seen the big cat's approach, and with their young fled swiftly\nand silently into the wood, leaving the two bulls locked in oblivious\ncombat.  The tiger leapt over a fallen tree, forgetting his pain, and\ncharged across the open space toward them.\n\nThe herd leader saw him coming, and stepped back.  The young male in his\nblind fury did not, and perceiving hesitation on the part of his\nopponent, thought to charge again.  It was his last mistake.  The tiger\nleapt full upon him, knocking him to the ground, and before the buck\nknew what had happened, his throat was held fast and his life's blood\nebbing.\n\nThe herd leader turned quickly to see what had become of his charge,\nthen with a last look at the predator and his fallen foe, moved to join\nthem.  He did not run blindly, nor fully turn his back.  But neither did\nhe dare a brave show.  Not for nothing had he lived to sire offspring.\n\nThe yearling stood poised above his kill, looking about him cautiously.\nHe felt neither sadness nor elation, only the openness around him, and a\nsullen determination not to surrender his prize.  Taking it firmly by\nthe scruff of the neck, he dragged it back among the timbers.  Lifting\nit across the same fallen trunk he had leapt in pursuing it, he set it\nto rest in the hollow just beyond, and once more looked around him.  No\nsight or sound broke the silence of the afterkill.\n\nIt was only then that he let himself rest, and remembered his hunger and\nhis pain.  His leg ached dully and his muscles tried to knot.  But these\ncould be denied.  His hunger could not.  Licking a spot on the carcass\nas he would a bosom friend (the feelings were not dissimilar), he lay\ndown and began to eat, and once more to feel pride and confidence in the\nstrength he possessed.\n\nHe had made, with help, the long climb back.  He would endure.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus stood at the beginning of the plain.  In one hand he held the\nsnares he meant to set, but in the other was his spear, which stubborn\noptimism had told him to bring.  And at his feet were the tracks of the\ntiger.  Studying them more closely, he saw that despite the sharp climb\nup from the gorge, there was no blood from its injured hind leg, and\nonly a trace of a limp.  The cub sniffed at the familiar prints,\nrecognizing their scent.\n\nKalus felt a sudden surge of desire.  An impulse had come to him, and he\nacted upon it at once.  Hiding his traps behind a stone, he dropped down\non one knee beside the cub.  With his hand he indicated the tracks, then\nthe line they followed into the distance.\n\n'Alaska.  These tracks.  Avatar.  We follow.  AVATAR.'\n\nThe cub looked back at him, confused.  But after repeating the gestures,\nthe name of the tiger, and finally, walking along its visible trail,\nKalus made her understand.  Nose to the ground, she began to pursue the\ntrail ahead of him, always urged to greater speed by her master.\nTogether they covered the distance swiftly, running whenever the snow\nand his strength permitted it.\n\nFor Kalus knew the tiger had set out the night before, and he had only\nthe daylight to find it.\n\nIf only its hunt had been successful.\n\n\n*\n\n\nIt was perhaps midday when he stood at the top of the same long hill,\nlooking down with lesser eyes upon the valley and the clearing by the\nstream.  He had begun to despair of his chances, knowing it would take\nnearly the rest of the day just to make his way back to the warmth and\nsafety of the cave.  Almost he had let the hill turn him back. But he,\ntoo, felt the stubborn need to persevere.\n\nHere, if the read the signs right, the cat had suddenly crouched and\nbegun to stalk.  His shielded eyes strained against the blinding white,\nup and down the stream, searching for any further sign.  But all such\neffort was defeated by the hard glare of the noon sun.  Perhaps if he\nmade his eyes like a quiet pool, in which any movement would be as a\npebble dropping into glassy waters.....\n\nMovement.  His eyes shifted to the source.  Again.  The branches of a\nleafless tree, no, the tree itself, moved under the weight of some large\nanimal, disturbing the snow-layered pines around it.  At the edge of the\nclearing, on the far side of the stream.  A short distance in front of\nit the snow had been mangled and stained, as by a recent kill.\n\nHe cut a swath straight towards it, risking much that the creature in\nthe tree was his own, self-named Avatar, proud hunter of the frozen\nwoodlands.  He came to the stream, and lifting both his garments and the\nstartled cub, waded across.  The shaking of branches had not ceased, and\nnow as he gained the far bank and set down the cub, a muffled growl was\nadded to it.  He froze, spear lifted.  But the sound had been neither\nsudden, nor seemed in any way to correspond with his movements.  And at\nlast, his eyes describing the scene, he lowered his spear with a surge\nof pride and gratitude.  It was his ally, the tiger, struggling to lift\na large buck into the crotch of a trembling beech.\n\n'Avatar!'\n\nThe great cat gave a sudden snarl, and dropping its prey, loosed its\nhold on the tree and leapt down to face him.  All done in an instant,\nand with such angry determination that the man-child's eyes went\nwide, and he took a step back in spite of himself.\n\nThe tiger, too, felt a moment of confusion.  For here was something not\nstamped into the racial memory of instinct.  Kalus it knew, as the\ncreature who fed and protected him at need.  He felt an association to\nhim, even a kind of closeness.  But he was also the first creature to\ndisturb him at his part-eaten kill, and those feelings were strong and\nimmediate.\n\nKalus seemed to understand this, because he stood silent and made no\nfurther move, staying the cub, who would have stepped freely to the meat\nher friend had provided.\n\nThe tiger looked at the tree, then at the man.  He vaguely recalled his\nmother, coming upon the scene of another tiger's kill, and the way it\nhad first snarled, then yielded, allowing her to eat.....  At last he\nsolved the puzzle.  Searching the forest behind him for any sign of\ndanger, he moved away from the buck and remained standing, patient but\nalert, leaving the other to eat his fill.\n\nKalus came forward steadily, and with a further greeting, began to cut\naway at the untouched back legs (which a more experienced predator would\nhave eaten first, but which were ideal for his purposes).  He worked\nhard and diligently with the hunter's knife, trying at the same time\nnot to jerk the carcass, which might arouse the tiger, at intervals\nshooing away the cub.\n\nHe felt as he did so an almost irrational need of haste, which went\nbeyond his concern for the tiger or the long journey home.  He could not\nhave explained it.  There was time to meet his ends.  No, it was more\nthe aggressiveness of the act itself which put him on his guard.  After\nso many days of caution and yielding, to have been so bold, and come to\nsuch a reward.....  And whether superstition or sixth sense, his one\ndesire at that moment was to take his portion and be gone.\n\nAs the last stubborn tendon surrendered its hold of the second leg, he\nstraightened his back with a sudden glow of pride and happiness.  He\nwanted to walk right up to his companion, a thing which he had never\ndone, and box his ears in relief and brotherly affection.\n\nBut in the same instant the shadow behind his fears took flesh, as with\na mad crash a large grizzly split through a wall of bushes, not forty\nfeet away.  And as it growlingly surveyed them with but a moment's\nconsideration, the tiger recognized his old enemy.\n\nFear rose instantly in the man-child, but stronger was his cornered\nrage.  A mindless brute, who knew nothing of his struggles and\nyearnings, blindly sought to steal what had cost him so dearly, and in\nso doing, rend or even kill both himself and his closest companions.\nKnowing that to run would be the greater danger, and goaded by his\npassion, he lifted his spear and cried out in fury, standing his ground\nand preparing for the inevitable charge.  The tiger seemed to feel much\nthe same emotion, for it too snarled threateningly, and even began to\nmove forward.\n\nBut in the dim perceptions of the monster there also burned dark fires.\nThis land was his, as was any in which he walked, and he would not be\ndefied.  His victory over the tiger still lived in him, and the\nman-child was beyond his experience.  He was a prince of power, and\naggression his only creed.  Coming close in short, growling breaths, he\nraised up his quivering bulk for battle, and on his hind legs advanced\ntoward the tiger.\n\nWhatever the poetic or philosophical may say, in Nature, as well as in\nMan's darkened nature, strength is often (and only) by cornered\nstrength defeated.  As the full eight-foot carriage of the bear began to\nlower toward the mortal and extinguishable flesh of his friend, Kalus\nfelt the terrible white fire that lives in every creature whose dearest\nare threatened, take hold of him.  And as the tiger drew back and raised\nits extending claws in answer, he drove his spear deep into the\ngrizzly's brawny neck and shoulder.  Nor did he draw away in the face\nof its fury, but drove in against the scruff, pinning its head while the\ntiger's slashing blows fell unmercifully.\n\nPulling back the shaft as the spearhead lost its bite, he drove it this\ntime into the bristling shoulder, and with a strength he would not have\nthought in him, from both point of pain and pressure, drove the thousand\npound menace onto its side.\n\nThis was all the tiger needed.  Slashing and biting, braving the peril\nof its roaring jaws, he tore away at the vital streams of his foe until\nthey spilled recklessly, and the raging heart that drove them was\nbetrayed in a self-defeating carnage of red.  The bear lurched forward,\ndying.\n\nKalus stepped back, panting, his heart near exploding with the effort\nand fear, while the tiger yet leered over his fallen enemy, unsure of\nits end.  Then the bear's eyes faded, and all was silence.\n\nThe cub whimpered out from its hiding place, looking to Kalus for some\nsign of reassurance.  He knelt down and caressed her head against him,\nfeeling much the same need himself.  Then turned to face his ally,\nfeeling a fierce kinship as deep and true as any he had ever\nexperienced.\n\nAt last the tiger stepped back, and raising its head, gave a growl of\npride and possession that told any who cared to listen that this land\nwas his, and his alone.  Kalus stepped back, acknowledging this, and\nwith a surge of bittersweet emotion, realized that his friend had\nascended to the magnificent freedom of a creature of the Wild. . .but\nalso that it no longer needed him.\n\n'You've done it,' he said quietly, and with such feeling that\nthe pent-up emotions burst forth in a flood of tears.  Then he shook off\nall weakness, lifted the legs of the deer, and looked one last time at\nhis friend.\n\n'Fly well, my Avatar.  My spirit is always with you.'\n\nKalus turned sadly toward home, and followed by the wolf, was away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 30\n\n\nIt was a quiet morning, and for the first time in weary days uncounted,\na truly mild one as well.  The sun shone warm and wet, there was little\nbreeze, and this time, Kalus knew, it was no illusion.  Winter was on\nthe wane.  If he had possessed a calendar, the day might have been\ncalled March 12.\n\nAnd though the inexorable changing of the seasons brought with it new\nconcerns and dangers, he resolved this day to feel some small\nsatisfaction in his victory over the Cold World.  Perhaps victory was\nnot the right word, since the primal elements knew no intelligence, and\nfelt no pain. Still.....\n\nSylviana came out to join him on the ledge, which through the softening\nsnow, was once more discernible as the same from which she had first\nsurveyed the confines of her new existence, and the untamable world that\nwas to be the only home of her adulthood.  Putting her hand through\nKalus' arm and nestling against him, both felt emotion stir inside\nthem, as sleeping dreams and fears alike, awoke to the possibilities of\nthe coming Spring.\n\nThe two looked at each other.  And without speaking, both knew that the\nmountains they had been forced to climb were too high, the valleys they\nhad endured, too abysmal and black.  Somehow a quieter space must be\nfound, where they could rest and recover their spirits, and climb no\nhigher feeling than gentle warm affection and peace.  Such, at least,\nwas their desire.\n\n'I miss the tiger,' said Kalus quietly.  'I knew he would have\nto go.  But still.'\n\n'I miss Akar,' she began.  Then suddenly striking upon the heart\nof her emotions.  'I miss my FATHER.' Tears welled in her eyes.\n'He never knew, because I didn't. . .how much I loved him.' She\nlowered her head and cried silently.  'How could I have been such a\nfool?'\n\nFeeling awkward, for all their time together, he gently took her hand\nand rubbed it.  For a time neither spoke.  Then he said sincerely.\n\n'If there is a God, he knows now.'\n\nShe looked up at him, so grateful, then embraced him with all the\nmingled love and sorrow for persons and places forever lost, and others\nfound.  He held her warmly, and after a time he added.\n\n'At least the season is mild and safe.  Perhaps the safest of the\nyear.  We will be free to move about with less worry.'\n\n'And a month from now?' she could not help asking.  Then she\nlooked up quickly, hoping she had not repaid his kindness unfairly.\n\n'It's all right,' he said, knowing her enough by now to read\nthis in her face.  'In a month I will think of something else. I ask\nonly this: that you don't punish yourself for what is gone, and what\ncan never be.....  Don't worry for the future, at least today.'\n\n'All right.' She turned toward him, taking both his hands in hers.\n'Did I ever tell YOU, Kalus?  That I love. . .you?' She looked\ninto his eyes, her spirit naked before him.\n\n'Yes, my sweet Sylviana.  Though you never said the words like this,\nyou told me many times.  You showed me.' He struggled.  'You know\nthat I would die for you---' She put a finger to his lips.\n\n'Live for me, instead.' And they quietly embraced.\n\nA moment later, Sylviana saw beyond his shoulder the outline of what\nappeared to be a stalking predator.  The image yet unresolved through\nher tears, it dropped slinking down into the gorge.\n\n'Kalus.  Something's coming this way.' He turned quickly, and\nshe pointed.  He drew his sword, and put her behind him with his arm.\nHe was about to tell her to withdraw, when something in the shadowy\nmovements struck a familiar chord inside him.  His eyes brightened, then\nhe smiled outright.  Once more the mad happiness engulfed him.\n\n'It's Avatar!'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'And there's no trace of a limp.  He's moving the way a great\ncat should.  See him climb!'\n\nBut as the striped form drew on, showing no sign of either fear or\nrecognition, she felt a tremor of doubt.  Surely the tiger they had\nknown was not so large and supple.  Yet as it slowed its movements and\nbroke again into sunlight, she recognized the eyes and striped markings\nof their friend.  Before she could ask, Kalus answered her.\n\n'He's nearly full grown now.  A few more months and no grizzly\nwill dare to stand up to him.' Looking at the powerful creature so\nclose at hand, she found this easy to believe.  For all her familiarity\nand trust, she could not help but feel a certain awe and fear.  Even the\nmuscles in Kalus' arm tensed involuntarily, as it came to a halt\nperhaps a dozen feet away.  But the tension was not lasting.  Sheathing\nhis sword, he spoke its name and began to advance toward it.\n\nBut at this the tiger turned away curiously, as if to retreat.  Once\nmore he gestured and spoke to it, but upon trying to come closer the\nresult was the same.\n\n'I think he wants me to follow him.  I don't understand his\nurgency, but I think that I should.  Will you be all right?'\n\n'Yes.  Be careful.  What about Alaska?'\n\n'Keep her here with you, until I find out what he's trying to tell\nme.' Turning one last time.  'I love you.'\n\n'Go on, will you?  And watch where you're going, you're going\nto break your neck.'\n\n'All right.  Goodbye.' He slowly disappeared among the shadows of\nthe gorge.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe tiger had begun by leading him southward along the bottom of the\ngorge.  He kept waiting for it to turn away westward, or double back\nupon its tracks, since the sandstone hills that formed the southern\nborder of his world were the unsleeping realm of the mountain cats.  And\nthough the tiger was the match of any unaltered creature of the winter\nforests, these powerful, saber-toothed throwbacks were not to be tested.\nAnd at the point where the sandstone and granite ridges met.....  He\ncould not even think about that.  With every step he became more leery,\nand whispered as loudly as he dared for the tiger to stop and turn back.\nBut to his utter dismay, it held fast to the deepening gorge until the\nend.\n\nLike a nightmare Kalus' felt his fears surround him, and all hope and\nsafety slip behind.  The walls at either hand became too steep to climb.\nHis messenger and guide, who for its own sake he dared not abandon,\nrefused to heed his warnings.  The shadows grew deeper, and up ahead he\nbegan to describe, half in fearful imagination, half in stark reality,\nthe outline of the darkest shadow that yet lived in all the Valley.\nLike a hole broken in the side of some ancient subterranean dungeon,\nstraight ahead of him, larger than natural life, he saw the yawning\nblackness of the Commodores' cave.  Only once before, as an\nadolescent, had he observed it, from the high western wall.  And when\nthe side-winding, forty foot reptile had sauntered out, tasting the hot\nsummer air with its tongue, he had run like the fleetest antelope,\noblivious to the singular (and dangerous) spectacle he made, his one\ndesire to be as far from the killing serpent as possible.  His more\nrecent encounter had only galvanized his fears.\n\nYet here he was, after years of struggle on the brink of a personal\nvictory, with love and hope in sight, being drawn irresistibly to the\none place above all others that he was loathe to go.  Indeed, it was the\nperil of these Winter-sleeping creatures that made him most uneasy in\nthoughts of the coming Spring.\n\nHis anger and fear merged into maddening exasperation, but still the\ntiger plodded forward, heedless.  It reached the dark overhang of\nsandstone and gazed back at him.  Yet again he repeated the gestures of\nwithdrawal, made unable by the consequences to speak.  The tiger nodded\nits understanding, or seemed to, but then to his horror and final\nconsternation, dove headlong into the grinning maw of death.\n\nOnce again Kalus was faced with the terrible choice: loyalty to one he\nloved, or survival for himself.  He stood trembling on the threshold,\nfrozen with fear and burning with inner conflict.  He looked back upon\nthe sunlit world and thought of his home: of his woman, and the cub.\nBut what kind of home would it be if he abandoned his friend at greatest\nneed?  Swallowing hard a cry of rage to deaf gods, he drew out the ready\nsteel of his sword, and plunged into darkness.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe hollow funnel of the passage had been worn flat by the years, and by\nthe constant passing of the inscrutable reptiles.  Kalus saw and heard\nnothing---only the pounding of his heart, and the gentle rasp of his fur\nboots against the life-dry sandstone.  He moved by sense of feel and\nair, in times of doubt probing ahead of him with the sword.  How far\nahead the tiger had gone he had no way of knowing.  And more and more he\nbegan to feel that if he must come upon the scene of its shadow-sprung\nperil, he would at least come upon it after, and in silence.  He\ncrouched lower and (if possible) stalked more quietly, advancing in a\nstate of warlike readiness.\n\nHow far he walked he could not say.  But suddenly, or perhaps only made\nsudden by the final acceptance of a half believed message from his eyes,\nhe became aware of a soft light in the distance.  This morning-like glow\nheld fast at the edge of sight, and as he drew closer, began by slow\ndegrees to reveal its source.  Ahead of him the funnel reached its\nnarrowest point, a squarish hole still broad enough for five men to pass\nabreast, that opened into a deepening expanse.  Coming toward the\nrising, hard-rock lip of it, he went down on his belly, crawled forward,\nand looked over into the heart of the thing he feared.\n\nThere are times when a man's worst fears are justified, and when he\ncannot, with any hope of survival, confront them.  But often through\npatience, perseverance, and the fullness of time, the antithesis of his\nlife can be worn down, altered, or made in the end less terrible.  And\nwhile it is the height of foolishness for any man to laugh in the face\nof death, neither must he deify the many smaller deaths of Fear.\n\nThere in the sunken center, the stage, as it were, of this vaulted\nsubterranean amphitheater, stood the tiger on a patch of sandy earth,\namong a tangle of living scrub.  A soft and warm light shone down on him\nthrough a broad opening in the stone overhead.  Nor was it a mere hole\nto the world beyond.  Through one of the many wonders of Nature, a vein\nof crystalline quartz interceded, allowing the sun's light to pass,\nwhile gathering and holding a fair measure of its warmth.\n\nAll these things he observed in the time it took for his eyes to adjust\nto what seemed a blinding glare, though in reality it was many shades\nlighter than the unfiltered sunlight.  He had not yet seen the shadows:\nthe tiger was not alone.\n\nThere, stretched lengthwise amid recessions in the descending,\nstair-like levels, as if the whole of a deceased family among the\nlayered shelvings of a crypt, a full score of the dreadful reptiles lay\nsleeping.  It was a sight to freeze the blood, but for one odd detail\nwhich their considerable girth clearly illustrated.  THEY DID NOT\nBREATHE.  Or if they did, it was so infrequently that in the\nconsiderable time he watched he never saw it.  No heave or swell of the\nelastic ribs and dry, loose-fitting skin could be seen, even where an\nentire flank stood out against the unshaded light from above.  BUT\nSURELY THEY WERE NOT DEAD.  No sign of decay could be seen on them, nor\nany apparent cause of death.\n\nSylviana had told him of the aquatic lizards of the Galapagos Islands,\nwho when diving for the sea vegetation which sustained them could hold\ntheir breath for an hour or more, even stopping their heartbeat to do\nso.  But even this did not fully explain the phenomenon by which these\nenormous, cold-blooded creatures could remain suspended for the nearly\nsix month period when the world outside became to them untenable, or\nreveal the inner clock that told them to wake once more, and slowly\nrevive into a living state.\n\nThe tiger, who had discovered this place on that first, bitter wandering\nfrom the man-child's cave, being drawn by its warmth and shelter, had\nno need for such questions, and simply accepted the fact.  He had\nreturned one time since, and in his animal way reasoned that these, like\nall hibernating creatures, would not be stirring until the weather\nturned warm.  And now that the time had come for him to return again\nnorthward, to the long forests where Winter hardly waned, he desired to\ngive some last gift to his friend, who had helped bring him back to the\nworld of the living.  This gift was the magic of the green, budding\ncactus which on that troubled night had opened his mind to show him that\nhis own feelings, as well as the strange company who had taken him in,\ncould be trusted.  He looked up at the Kalus placidly, waiting for him\nto come down.\n\nKalus stood regarding the scene some moments longer.  Though he slowly\nreasoned that the danger was remote, or at least not immediate, a den of\ndragons, be they live, dead or sleeping, is not to be entered lightly.\nAnd he could not imagine why the tiger had brought him here.  At last he\nbegan to descend, though warily, all the time watching the silent shapes\nfor any sign of movement or consciousness.  There were none.  He came to\nthe dry, earthy disc in the bowl's center, and approached the tiger.\nHis expression and body language were taut as he said.  'Why, Avatar?\nWhy, of all the places you have ever been, did you bring me here?'\n\nIn mute reply the tiger carefully took one of the buds in his teeth and\nplucked it free, as on that night he had done, seeking the moisture and\nsustenance within.  Then began to chew, curling his lip and tongue in\nreaction to the bitter taste.  But the taste had been bitter on that\nfirst night as well.\n\nKalus knelt to examine the plant, and the special part that his friend\nhad eaten.  YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TO TASTE THE FRUIT OF A GNARLED DESERT?\nhe thought curiously.  For so it seemed to him.  But looking into the\ndeep, mysterious eyes of the tiger, and again at the strange plant he\nhad never seen, he wondered.  Using the hunting knife he carefully cut\naway several of the buds, placing them in his pouch.  He was tempted to\nput the last in his mouth, but something warned him off.  Not until I am\nfree of this place, he thought, and the tiger seemed to understand.\n\nTogether they withdrew, to ride the dragon's wing.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe four of them stood again on the ledge, the cub jumping playfully at\nthe tiger's face.  Avatar patiently eluded the mock biting, and\npushed her away with softened claws.  Like Akar before him, he too found\nit hard to leave them, and still harder to expression the affection and\ngratitude he felt.\n\nRetrieving the cub, Kalus knelt directly in front of him and gently,\ncautiously stroked the great head.  'Don't worry,' he said.\n'I understand your silence better than many who can speak.  I know\nyou have to leave.  And I'm proud, so very proud that I could help\nyou, and be a part of your life. I will never forget you.' He put his\nface against its shoulder, and let a few tears pass.  'It's the\nway of it, my friend.  But wherever you go, a part of me will always\nfollow.'\n\nThe tiger stood still, confused, but he did not pull away.  Again their\neyes met, and in that moment it seemed that the two worlds, animal and\nman, could truly touch.  The tiger pulled back slowly.  Kalus raised\nhimself and took a deep breath.\n\n'Goodbye,' said Sylviana.  'I know you can't\nunderstand. . .but you gave back to me someone very dear.'\n\nThe tiger turned and retreated down the slope, as human eyes felt again\nthe bittersweet flow of mortal life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 31\n\n\nIt was evening before Kalus said anything to Sylviana of the\nmorning's adventures.  First there had been work to do, then he felt\nreluctant to worry her.  Finally, as they sat side by side on a flat\nstone before the diminishing fire, she asked him.\n\n'Where did Avatar take you?' For an answer he reached into his\npouch and took out the cactus buds, and laid them on the stone between.\n'Did you ever see these, or hear of them?  They come from a desert\nplant that is like but unlike others I have seen.  He was very intent on\nmy eating them---he risked much---but I wanted to talk to you first.'\n\nShe took one in her fingers, and held it up against the light.  'If I\ndidn't know better.....  They look like peyote buttons.'\n\n'What are they?'\n\n'A hallucinogenic cactus, used by the Native Americans in dances and\nreligious ceremonies.  It's a kind of drug, if that's the right\nword for something found in Nature.  It's supposed to open the mind,\nand let you see things beyond the physical reality.'\n\n'Is it a kind of magic, then?' He was fascinated and intrigued\nthat the tiger had experienced this elevated state, and wanted him to\nfeel it, too.\n\n'I guess you could call it that.  But one very dangerous to the\nyoung, or to anyone who doesn't know what they're doing.'\n\n'Have you ever eaten them?'\n\n'No.  I've smoked marijuana, which is safer.....  But Kalus, these\ncan't possibly be peyote.'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'Because if the tiger had eaten them he'd have gone crazy: he\nwouldn't have understood.  He wouldn't have been able to think it\nthrough.'\n\n'And maybe for that same reason he wasn't afraid.  You still\ndon't see it, do you?  An animal's mind isn't less than ours,\nonly different.  He lives in his world as clearly, and understands it as\nwell, as you and I.  He is not a half-wakened child.'\n\n'Well, assuming all that's true, and that this is peyote.  Do you\nthink you're ready for it?  Because I promise you, it would take your\nmind to places it's never been.  It could be very frightening.....\nNow you're scaring me.'\n\nIndeed, he had all but stopped listening, gazing instead with fixed\nintensity upon the mystical substance before him.\n\n'I want to try, Sylviana, if only for the pains it cost me to bring\nit here.' He looked at her intently.  'Where Avatar leads, I want\nto follow if I can.'\n\n'I can't stop you, but.....  Oh, Kalus.  I'm so afraid\nyou'll hurt yourself.  And after all we've been through.'\n\nHe saw the wisdom of this, and her deep concern.  'What if eat just\none, and you are here with me?'\n\nThe endless conflict between safety and wild freedom once more presented\nitself.  Both felt it clearly.  She hesitated, then said.\n\n'If we do it, we do it together.'\n\n'All right.'\n\nKalus put a bud in his mouth.  Sylviana did the same.\n\n\n***\n\n\n'This is amazing.'\n\nRoughly an hour had passed, and these words so broke the stillness that\nit seemed as if Kalus had then and there invented speech.  And indeed,\nso far as concerned the virgin sea on which they now sailed, eternal and\nboundless, these were the first words, and he and the woman-child, the\ntrue Adam and Eve.\n\nFor some time now he had remained as a near statue, only his eyes and\nforehead working, studying in alternate wonder his hand, the circle of\nstones, then the altar and mirror behind it.  Sylviana watched him,\nfeeling the same awe of the experience, and perhaps to a greater degree,\nthe accompanying danger.  She answered simply.\n\n'Yes.'\n\nHer voice, like a pebble in a pool, touched the glassy waters of his\nspirit, sending out ripples of thought and feeling which seemed as\nendless as the pool itself.  Regaining his center, he became placid with\nthe wisdom of silence, until the shoots that stirred within him were\nready to blossom once more in true speech.  Sylviana was becoming\nconcerned, but he had not forgotten her.\n\n'All my days,' he said finally, 'I've judged life by the\npale shadow of it in which I've often been forced to live, never\nguessing that the heart. . .the very bones of it. . .are ALIVE.' He\npaused.\n\n'It seems to me now, as it did when I was a child, that no hope, no\ndream is ever fully lost, so long as the least fragment remains alive\ninside you. It becomes like a seed---sleeping, dormant.  But not dead.\nUntil, if we can endure, and fight our way to a better place where sun\nand water yet flow, it is called gently back to life.'\n\nHe looked at her, tears streaming down his face.  'I am alive!  And\nyou, my endless miracle.  Are alive, and here with me.'\n\nShe took his hand, so close, and pressed it to her lips.\n\n'Be gentle, my loving Kalus.  Be gentle.  There are still so many\nwounds.'\n\nNever, it seemed to him, had she spoken more truly.  For he now felt in\nthe wrenching of his heart, as surely as if the flesh itself ached and\nbled, the many scars that lay across him.  He became quiet, and put his\nhead against her, knowing that for all his yearning, patience alone\nwould heal him, and make those forgotten dreams possible.\n\nTime passed.\n\nAt length Kalus raised himself, understanding, and better able to handle\nthe heightened state of his senses, feeling once more like a peaceful\nsea from which the gale has passed, softened and grateful.\n\n'Thank you,' he said to her.  He took a deep breath.\n\n'Are you all right?'\n\nThere was something more than womanly concern in her voice.  An intense\ncuriosity had taken hold of her, as if she too pondered some great\nriddle of her past.  The questions twirled like serpents about the\nobject she now surveyed.\n\n'Yes.  What are you thinking?'\n\n'I've been looking at the mirror,' she said, gazing at it\nstill.  'All this time we've taken the altar, and the visions of\nthat night, for granted, perhaps because the questions were too deep,\nand they frightened us.....  But what does it all mean, Kalus?  What's\nBEHIND it?'\n\nTurning toward the singular apparatus, which like her he had left aside\nuntil this night as simply too much to contemplate, he was again drawn\nby its silent mystery.  But in his more earthy, less ethereal way, he\ntook the question literally.  What lay BEHIND it? And stirred at last to\nphysical action, he took from his pouch the round hammer-stone and\napproached the blue-black mirror, which seemed to waver in strange\npatterns before him.\n\nAs the woman watched, he tapped first along the rock immediately\nsurrounding the glass, then above, and around the altar.  There could be\nno doubt: the sounds were hollow.  Some hidden chamber lay beyond.  He\nturned to his companion.\n\n'Shall I break the glass?'\n\nAgain she felt an inner turmoil.  But her need to know was so great.....\n'Yes.'\n\nHe shielded his eyes with his arm, much as he had on the night when\ntogether they heard the Voice. . .and hurled his stone into the heart of\nit.\n\nWith a crash the mirror burst. And when she dared to open her eyes\nagain, her first reaction was disappointment.  Only a hole remained,\nlined about the edges with jagged bits of glass.  But forbidding and\ntooth-like as these appeared, they could with care be removed, and the\npassage rendered safe.  This Kalus set out to do, protecting his hand\nwith a small skin and pulling out the pieces one by one, unable yet to\npenetrate the gloom of what lay beyond.\n\n'Bring me the torch,' he said to her.\n\nBut now the girl became suddenly timid.  Seeing the result of her\nhandiwork, she wondered if in her restless curiosity she had not tempted\nthe undoing of all Faith.\n\n'It's all right,' he said, somehow knowing her thoughts.\n'If a belief can be so easily destroyed, by the least physical\nreality, it is not worthy of the hope we place in it.  I would rather\nput my faith in something that can be trusted.'\n\nHer eyes pleaded.\n\n'I know,' he said more quietly.  'Nothing is that simple.  But\nthe miracle of the Voice is not banished yet.  Bring me the torch, and\nwe'll see what lies beyond.'\n\nSlowly she calmed the surge of religious fear, and took from its mount\non the wall the torch that they had made.  She handed it to him as he\ncontinued to reach across the polished granite, removing or brushing\naside the broken glass that remained.  He then moved the torch from side\nto side, trying to see.....\n\n'There is a room, about the same size of the upper cave.  But it is\nhigher, and filled with objects I don't know.' Taking the fur\ncanopy from his bed, he folded it and used it to line the edges, still\nrough, of the opening.  Then tossing the light in gently ahead of him,\nhe mounted the altar. And passed within.\n\n'I'm coming, too,' came the woman's voice after him.\nPerceiving no immediate danger, he wedged the torch into an opening, and\nhelped her through the empty, oval space.  Upon regaining her feet, the\ngirl looked around her. . .and gave voice to her dismay.\n\n'Computers.' And so it was.  One entire wall of the square-cut\nchamber consisted of nothing but the sterile MACHINES: voice and thought\nanalyzers, communications and memory, species, mythology, and logic\nsequencers.  The woman felt used, betrayed.\n\n'All that time in the cave, alone and afraid.  My only hope was the\nvoice that spoke to me through the glass.  To know that it was reading\nmy thoughts and secret hopes, and telling me to remain there.....  Just\nMACHINES.  All a terrible hoax.'\n\n'Not all, my sweet Sylvie, and not terrible.  The warnings they spoke\nwere true, and may have saved your life.  And in the end, I did come to\nyou.' He put his arm around her.\n\n'And is it not a miracle after all?  Think of it.  I was born fully\nhuman, on a night when stars fell from the sky.  Then Akar comes to me\nin Barabbas' cave: I see a terrible vision, and am made an outcast.\nThe Mantis finds you in the mountains of the North and brings you here.\nWe are brought together.' He turned towards her.  'Even if\nmachines could accomplish all or part of that, so many miracles had to\ncome first.  Life on Earth.  The Universe itself, rather than a great,\nformless void.\n\n'What are the odds of it?' he continued.  'That you and I\nshould be standing here now, alive and still young, with love and hope,\nand the chance to make a better life.  Is that not miracle enough?'\n\n'I know what you're saying.  And of course you're right.  It\njust felt better. . .I don't know. . .to think that God was watching\nme.  That He loved and cared about ME.....  I'm going to miss\nthat.'\n\n'When I was a child, I thought as a child,' he quoted.  'When\nwe are young we need such illusions, such security.  And who is to say\nwhat does and does not exist in the world beyond our sight?  Not I.\nHere I stand, surrounded by wonders I could not dream of.  To think that\na light from a machine could reach inside my mind, and give me the power\nto speak.'\n\nAt this the woman suddenly stirred, and drew away from him.  She\nexamined the machinery more closely, confounded, overwhelmed.  It\nwasn't possible.\n\n'What is it, Sylviana?' Still for a time she could not speak,\ntrying to follow the rapid, and incredible chain of thought.\n\n'My father was a scientist,' she said finally.  'And I knew\nsomething of on-going research.  This technology: the fire that burned\nfrom nothing, the ability to read my thoughts.....  And the violet beam,\nGIVING YOU THE POWER OF SPEECH. Kalus, unless I'm dead wrong.  This\nequipment, and the altar. . .weren't left here by men!  We haven't\nadvanced nearly this far.'\n\nWith this her weary despondency left her.  She was consumed instead by\nthe eager, questioning thought that her father had passed on to her\nalmost without her knowing it: Science, the study of the visible God.\n\nExamining the back of the chamber, she found a steep passage carved into\nthe rock, after a single bend to the left, leading in a straight line\nupward and eastward. But surely \u0091carved' was not the right word.\nThe walls were smooth as glass, the floor rippled, as if to accommodate\nsome creature which had used the uneven surface to enter and return.....\nThe slanting tube rose far out of sight---to the top, she imagined, of\nSkither's fifteen-hundred foot mountain.  A score of masons\ncouldn't have done the fine work in twenty years.\n\n'What does it mean?' asked Kalus, lost in the wake of her\ndiscovery and unable to follow.\n\n'The oldest question of all, Kalus.  Is there life among the stars?\nBut here, let's follow the passage and see where it leads.  I'll\ntell you more when I know more.'\n\nNow it was he who became trepid, not understanding.  She couldn't\nhelp herself.  She laughed.\n\n'Oh, did I look as foolish when you broke the mirror?  There's no\nreason to be afraid. I'm sure there's no one here now.  Machinery\nthis advanced could have been working completely on its own for\ncenturies.'\n\nShe took his hand, and together they made their way up the long,\narrow-straight passageway, pacing their steps and resting often, so as\nnot to exhaust themselves in the climb and have nothing left.  And yet\nat each pause their sense of wonder, as well as the now tenable magic of\nthe peyote, only seemed to increase.\n\nFor so, too, do Science and the indescribable beauty Nature walk---the\nstudy and living manifestation, respectively, of the enigmatic Spirit of\nthe Universe.\n\nAnd as they stepped out at last onto a high platform open to the stars,\nboth felt it so clearly.  The sabled dome of sky, scattered with living\ndiamonds, throbbed and pulsed, undeniable: Eternity's Breath.\n\nAnd though they found nothing more alien or fantastic than a smooth,\nhalf-crater floor, opening unbarriered on the East, still, this was more\nthan enough.  The vastness of the sky reached like a limitless ocean,\nislanded by countless suns and unseen planets.\n\nAnd on the nearer, more tangible horizon, its pounding surf just audible\nin the distance.....  Kalus' heart caught in his throat.  How it\ncalled to him! Earth-mystical, everlasting, unvanquished by the follies\nof men. . .he saw it as for the first time.  Endlessly living.\n\nThe Sea.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThey remained there until morning, speaking or in silence, taking in the\nenormity of life, and thinking things they'd never thought before.\n\nWhile the silent stars watched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\nThe Island of Ruins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough nothing can bring back that hour Of splendour in the grass, of\nglory in the flowers; We will not grieve, rather find Strength in what\nremains behind....\n\n---William Wordsworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 32\n\n\nSylviana strolled easily along the beach, the cub running playfully up\nahead of her.  As she walked the cool ocean breeze wrapped her face and\nbody in its blanket of moist freshness.  The water-pocked sand beneath\nher felt cold and invigorating.  Tiny trills of foam nipped at her feet\nas if demanding her attention, before returning in hissing protest to\nthe sea.\n\nAt long last, she thought, they had come to a place where this simple\npleasure, a walk in the open air, did not mean exposure to imminent\nperil.  High walls of stark, weather-beaten stone protected the cove\nfrom behind and to either side, reaching long tendrils out into the\nwater.  And between its arms and hollow chest a strip of sand, perhaps a\nmile long and a third as deep, lay open to the sea and sun.  Lack of\ngame, as much as the forbidding walls, kept the predatory threat of the\nland animals away from them.  So Kalus had told her.\n\nFor this same reason he had never considered the margins of the sea as a\nhome of any duration.  But on that night when he felt its call so\nstrongly, remaining upon the high watch until the fiery sun had risen\nfrom its depths to light the land, Sylviana had spoken of the many ways\nthat food could be obtained there.  His restless thought needed no other\nprompting. In the following weeks they had taken what they needed and\ncould carry, and come the gray stone distance to the north and east, to\nlive.  That Kalus had another reason for doing so he kept to himself, a\nseeming contradiction to the intimate closeness of those days.  But he\nknew the symptoms of his heart and would not cross them.  Not yet.  He\nwas afraid, and at the same time drawn, to the thing he did not\nunderstand.\n\nThe girl watched happily as Alaska made a reckless charge back through\nthe surf, crashing the shallow water against her chest with the\ninexhaustible energy of youth.  Having lived more than half her life\namong humans, it seemed a perfectly natural thing to do: running in\njoyful frolic toward the outstretched, clapping hands of her soft,\nfemale friend.  And as she came to a sudden, impulsive halt, shaking the\ncold water from her fur, she took little notice as Sylviana turned a\npuzzled gaze far out across the waters. It only meant that her friend no\nlonger wished to play.\n\nSylviana couldn't believe her eyes.  IT HAS TO BE AN ILLUSION, she\nthought.  SOME KIND OF MIRAGE.  But still the image lingered.  Perhaps a\nhalf mile out, a lone human figure had just emerged from the water and\npropped itself gracefully atop a tiny islet, a mere rock at the edge of\nthe continental shelf, which had somehow survived the weathering of the\nyears.\n\nAt least it looked human.  Just at the distance where eyesight begins to\nfail and imagination to fill the void, the creature looked strangely\nsurreal: something from an ancient legend of the sea.  Half blocked from\nher vision by the stone, only its naked back and blondish mane were\nvisible.  These seemed human enough.  But she was sure she remembered\nsomething odd about the way it emerged. . .the way it\nmoved. . something.\n\nBut suddenly her eyes descried a far more substantial form, undeniable.\nA huge, black dorsal fin split the surface of the water like a knife,\nthen began to move in slow patient circles around the speck of land and\nshelter.  Incredibly, the lone figure seemed not to notice.\n\nLike wildfire, the thoughts and fears chased each other through her\nmind.  MY GOD, ANOTHER HUMAN!  PERHAPS THE LAST.  AND A SHARK!  I'VE GOT\nTO DO SOMETHING!  Cupping her hands in front of her mouth, she inhaled\nas deeply as her anxiety and thumping heart would allow, and shouted in\ndesperation:\n\n'Look out!  Stay out of the water, there's a shark!' It was no\nuse, the north wind and crashing surf devoured her feeble warning.\nTrying to master her panic, she took several deep breaths, and cried out\nat the top of her lungs.\n\n'Shark!  Shark!  Stay out of the water.  A SHARK!'\n\nThis time the creature reacted.  Turning towards the sound, it returned\nher startled gaze with one of its own, revealing for an instant a young,\nalmost childish face.  Then to her horror, it leapt into the water\nimmediately beside the giant killer.  Frozen in terror she could only\nwatch, unable to move or think.  She didn't breathe.\n\nReaching the orca's back, the young male mounted quickly and was\ngone.\n\nStill on the shore, Sylviana stood incredulous.  The boy must have seen\nit.  Had he really grabbed hold of the fin, or had she just imagined it?\nHer eyes detecting motion farther out, once more she beheld the\nimpossible pairing.  This time there could be no doubt.  A young boy,\nperhaps twelve or thirteen, had resurfaced with his mount, a massive\nkiller whale.  Clutching with hand and foot both the dorsal and pectoral\nfins, his limbs spread spider-like against the surging torso, he rode as\nif he had been born to it.\n\nIn fact, he had.\n\n\n*\n\n\n'Kalus!' The girl came running to the place where he stood tacitly\nshaping a net, surprised he hadn't heard her shouts.  He saw her but\ndid not immediately react, half knowing what she was going to say.  She\nwas going to tell him she'd seen a water-child.  He waited patiently,\nhoping she would understand.\n\n'Kalus,' she repeated, closer and out of breath.  'I saw\nanother human. . .or something that looked like one.  It saw me and\ndashed off to sea, on the back of a killer whale!'\n\n'Yes.  I know.'\n\n'You saw it, too?'\n\n'No, but I have seen them before.'\n\nShe looked him full in the face, perplexed.  'You knew there were\nother humans, and you never told me?  My God, Kalus, why?'\n\n'Because I was afraid.'\n\n'Afraid of what?' she demanded.\n\n'Afraid that if you knew there were others, you would have less need\nof me.  That you would not love me as much, always wondering.....'\n\n'Oh, Kalus, that's so unfair!  How could you think so little of\nme?' But even as she denied his words, she knew they held a grain of\ntruth.\n\n'I'm sorry,' he said. Finding no other expression, he repeated.\n'I'm sorry.'\n\nFor a moment she had forgotten him, and the effect her resentment would\nhave.  Now she looked at him, at the weary, washed-out face of long ago,\nand remembered.\n\n'OH.' She came behind and wrapped her arms around his chest and\nheld him tightly.  'It's all right.  I understand.'\n\nWith little further speech the two worked on the nets until night forced\nthem back into the cave, a small hollow bored into smooth stone twenty\nfeet above the sand.  It was neither spacious nor comfortable, but Kalus\ndid not intend to remain there long.\n\nBoth knew, as later in the dead of night he opened his heart to her,\nthat they must leave the roots of their past and strike out to a new\ndestination.  To the Island, where Kalus had often marked the smoke of\nfires, and where he hoped to find some answer to the questions that\nunsettled him, not the least of which was the riddle of the Children of\nthe Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 33\n\n\nThe beauty of the Sea was not lost on him, for all his preoccupation\nwith the Island.  Every day it revealed new wonders, and more and more\nhe came to realize that it was not only a home and harbinger of infinite\nlife, but a living, tangible thing unto itself.  When Sylviana told him\nit had been the birthplace of life on Earth he was not surprised.  When\nshe remarked that little seemed to have changed, despite the nuclear\nholocaust, he believed, and felt quietly reassured.\n\nBut he also saw clearly the darker, more savage aspect of the waters,\nwhich the poetic (usually from the detached safety of an untroubled ship\nor peaceful shoreline) often seemed to overlook.  For if the Valley had\nbeen ruthless and produced, with few exceptions, a grim array of\nthoughtless, thankless creatures, their only creed survival of the\nfittest, then the Sea was the very creator, and composer of the theme.\nFierce, desperate mating followed by birth in huge numbers, of which not\none in a hundred reached adulthood to fight and breed again, seemed the\nunbroken rule of this world without shelter, where life and death chased\neach other like madness, and none were immune.\n\nOne morning he watched as a pair of tiny animals, some forgotten\noffshoot of the hermit crab, dueled at the bottom of a small, clear\ntidal pool for the affections of a waiting female.  Not only was their\nbattle as cruel and fierce as any he had ever seen on land, but the\nspeed and nature of their movements was so reminiscent of the small,\npoisonous spiders of the Carak that he, an immense land animal\ninfinitely safe upon the inaccessible rock, had unconsciously recoiled\nin fear and disgust.\n\nOn another occasion a smallish gray shark, deceived this far north by an\nalluring current of warm water, became entangled in one of the nets they\nhad strung at the end of a natural jetty.  When dragged ashore with the\nmeager catch that had lured it, its death struggle had been so ferocious\nthat it haunted Kalus' sleep for weeks afterward.  Hopelessly\nentangled, drowning in a sea of air, it had nonetheless thrashed and\nsnapped for what seemed a eternity, destroying the net and reeking such\nhavoc that the startled fisherman, had he been able, would gladly have\nthrown it back into the sea.  And even when it finally expired, the\nrazor-sharp teeth and leering jaws had presented such a frightening\nspecter that he refused, instinctively, to touch it.\n\nReluctantly Sylviana had admitted that this behavior, either in killing\nor being killed, was in no way exceptional among sharks. And far from\nbeing the archetype of its race, this relatively small and undeveloped\ncreature could not begin to match the rakish refinements of the Blue,\nthe Tiger, and the ineffable Great White.  That they preferred to feed\nupon the dead and dying, that they usually left substantial, uninjured\ncreatures alone, was robbed of all comforting assurance by the fact that\ntheir perceptions were so dim, their mental development so limited, that\nthe actions of a given individual in a given situation could in no way\nbe safely predicted.  Like life itself, there was just no telling.  From\nthis experience these thriving, thoughtless killers became for him the\nvery symbol of the dark, violent side of nature that had always so\nterrified and appalled him.\n\n'There must be something more to life,' he said, on the thirteenth\nnight since their arrival.  They sat before a driftwood fire in the\nsand, protected from the wind by the high north wall, a short distance\nfrom their cave.  With the stars above and the soft murmur of the waves\nbefore them, there was peace and sadness enough in his heart to speak of\nit, and to admit the vague emptiness he found so hard and painful to\nexpress.  For he knew that she felt an emptiness, too.\n\n'All the birth and dying,' he continued, 'The endless struggle\njust to survive, and to create new beings to struggle and die when you\nare gone.  It is very hard for me to say this, Sylviana, but there are\ntimes when I think Nature is very cruel, and I can see no wisdom in\nliving only by her laws.'\n\n'But aren't you the one who's always saying that the societies\nof men must have failed because they had forgotten the simple goodness\nof Nature, \u0091primal virtue' and all of that?  That society had\noverridden the subtle ways of the Tao, creating its own, alternative\norder in which Man's will alone was powerful?  That there were no\nnatural, softening influences to prevent man's ignorance and\nviolence?' Her words seemed mockery, but there was a reason for them.\nShe was trying to draw him to the heart of the matter, which could be\ndifficult when he became thoughtful and began to withdraw.\n\n'You know I've said these things, and you know I still believe\nthem.  But why couldn't men do both: raise themselves above the\nendless struggle, and still have the thought and compassion to put away\nwar and racial hatred, to feed and clothe and give medicine to those who\nneed it?  Why does it have to be one or the other?' There was no\nanswer to such a question.  Impatiently, she stirred the fire with a\nstick.\n\n'Aren't you really trying to tell me that you've decided to\nvisit the island at all costs, and that you're afraid of what you\nmight find there?'\n\n'Yes,' he replied dourly, confused.\n\n'Why are you so threatened by the Children?  From everything\nyou've told me, they sound even more primitive than the\nhill-people.' For a moment his eyes flashed, but he knew she meant no\ninsult.\n\n'Because I think there could be some other colony on the Island as\nwell.' Her eyes became suddenly large, and she turned toward him\nintently.  He continued reluctantly.\n\n'I told you I've seen the smoke of campfires, and as many as\ntwelve riders at once making toward the island at sunset.  But I've\nalso seen other lights, bright and unnatural, and broad beams that split\nthe night.....  I don't know what they mean.'\n\nAs she heard this her heart beat suddenly faster.  It was all too\nfantastic.  Old voices and dreams that she had thought dead and in the\npast, surged recklessly to life inside her.\n\n'We've got to go there!  We've got to find out.'\n\n'Yes.' He paused, watching her intently in his turn.  'I'm\nsorry I couldn't tell you all at once.  It was a lot to think\nabout.'\n\n'I understand.' She got up and began to pace restlessly, breathing\ntoo deep, unable to control it.  'Oh, Kalus, I feel as if I'm\ngoing to burst.'\n\n'I'll be there with you.'\n\n'Yes.  YES.' Like a child she ran and wrapped her arms about him.\n\nBut later that night, unable to sleep and watching his familiar form\nbeside her in the darkness, she was dismayed by a strange voice that\ntold her she wished she was going alone.  Even as he had said, she began\nto wonder how deep, how true, how honest was their love?  And for the\nfirst time in many months she felt the terrible uncertainty of the\ndreamer who has wrapped all hope and affection about the shoulders of a\nsingle lover.\n\nIS THIS THE MAN I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH?  And as much\nas she wanted to say yes, she couldn't.  Because she didn't know.\n\n\n*\n\n\nIn the chill hour of dawn Kalus woke, and in turn looked upon the\nsleeping figure into whom he had poured his life's blood.  To see her\nlying there beside him, breathing evenly, her face warm and softened\nlike a child's, was all that he had ever asked, or ever could ask, of\nthe Nameless.  His love for her in that moment, when he knew, or feared,\nthat her loyalty to him would soon be put to its severest test, was\nalmost unbearable.  Thoughts of a life without her he could not begin to\nface, and he, too, felt a moment of doubt.\n\n'Sometimes if you love someone, you have to let them go.' She\nhadn't meant the words then, but what if now.....  If their love\ncould not stand, in the bright and hard light of day, then the efforts\nof a lifetime were in vain.  For if she, who knew him to the depths of\nhis being---his trials and broken dreams, his personal weakness and\nindomitable strength---if she found in him nothing to love and cherish\nand hold on to, then who in all the cold, lonely world ever would?\n\nIf he had known the full quotation, or she the effect its partial\nphrasing would have on him, perhaps they could have talked it out, and\nboth found in these simple but profound words some solace:\n\n'If you love something, set it free.  If it comes back to you, it is\nyours.  If it does not, it never was.'\n\nAnd if, in that moment he had woken her, perhaps she would have seen in\nhis eyes a depth of love that put aside all questions, and in the\nreturning echo of her heart, sealed their bond forever.  But he did not\nwake her, because he was afraid.  And she never told him the full quote,\nbecause like so many of life's precious and irretrievable moments, it\nwas gone forever.\n\nHe couldn't cage her, and he knew it.  She couldn't love him fully\nwithout knowing.  So be it.\n\nSo it was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 34\n\n\nIt had been decided that they should build a boat.  The only questions\nleft to them were what kind of vessel it should be, and whether to cast\noff directly from the cove, or to build the craft some distance upstream\nalong the banks of the Broad River, and follow its currents through the\ndelta which then spilled to either side of the Island.\n\nTwo considerations made Kalus choose the latter course.  First there was\nthe problem of acquiring the wood.  There were no trees of substance\nwithin a mile of their rock-bound haven, and no way of transporting the\nfarther wood here.  Second, neither he nor the girl had sufficient\nexperience in ship-building to put an adequate vessel to sea, and\nperform the long, slow tack against both wind and current, northward.\nAnd though building the craft upstream meant exposure to the returning\nland animals, this danger, at least, he understood and could in some\nmeasure anticipate.  For he knew without being told that only a fool\ntakes to the sea unprepared.\n\nSo for the first long days, until Kalus understood well enough to\ncontinue on his own, they made the journey together to the riverside\nclearing where he had cut a single trunk of elm.  Eighteen feet long, it\nwould be halved and hollowed out, later to be lashed together into a\nsturdy, double canoe.  James Michener had described such a boat in his\ntales of Hawaii, and Sylviana had never forgotten.  Nor had she dreamed\nin those easy, carefree days at Ithaca College that she would one day be\ndrawing her very existence from the precious knowledge such men passed\non.\n\n'Great fullness seems empty, yet it can never be exhausted.' So\nLao Tsu had said, and more and more in these uncertain days he was\nproving the most trustworthy guide.  Her life had become like a precious\nring dropped into a shallow stream: the thrashing of her hands only\nmuddied the waters, and made it impossible to find.  Let the stream flow\nand cleanse, let the sediments sink back.  Then, and only then, could\nshe see what lay at the bottom.\n\nBut if Sylviana felt the need and desire to surrender, Kalus experienced\na vastly different emotion: raw and intolerable frustration.  He could\nnot understand why Nature seemed to resist him at every turn, in an\nendeavor which he knew must be put forward and carried out.  And the\nconditions in which he was expected to pull off this miracle were\nappalling.  He had neither saw nor plane nor adze, every day the threat\nfrom the returning animals grew, and yet somehow he must construct a\nboat in which to trust the very lives of those he loved.\n\nEach morning he would rise, his back aching from the previous day's\nlabor, and make the five mile journey across rock and open land to the\nsmall clearing, there to struggle and shape until the sun began to set.\nThen the journey back, to a place he could hardly think of as home, and\na life which began to seem more and more alien, without the roots of his\npast.  The girl massaged him, encouraged him.  But since the night of\nhis full disclosure a subtle wedge had been driven between them,\nintensified by Kalus' need to concentrate all his energies on\npersonal safety and construction of the craft.\n\nIt reminded her at times of the way he had spent himself in constructing\nthe barrier to the Mantis' cave, and its later effect on him.  But\nshe kept this to herself, knowing that previous labor had been essential\nas well, and completed not a day too soon.  Hidden fires drove him, and\nif they tended to turn him in upon himself there was little she could,\nor possibly should do to change it. He became once more an enigma to\nher, and at times it seemed they met at nightfall like loyal strangers,\ncast upon a desert island and enjoined, of necessity, to live and work,\nand carry out disparate dreams of love, together.  It was a cold\nmetaphor, perhaps, but there was no denying it. He had been to her,\nliterally, the last man on Earth.  And she to him?  The fact that he\ntruly loved her, and would have if given the choice of thousands, he\ncould not tell her, and she didn't ask.  His love was primal,\nunquestioned.  And though she too had felt these pure, gut-level\nurgings, she was reluctant to be bound by them, when there were so many\nother things to consider. And to look at it from every possible angle\ndidn't help.  The questions only brought more questions.  Only time,\nand trial, would tell.\n\nIn the end Kalus' will proved stronger than the knotted wood and lack\nof tools. The boat was finished and rigged, and the moment was at hand.\nThey waited for a day when the winds were not contrary, then set out\ntogether for the clearing, the vessel, and the mystery that lay beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 35\n\n\nThe double prow of the canoe floated gently in the swirling backwater of\nthe launch, its stern still bound by gravity to the sloping earth of the\nbank behind.  The supplies (what there were of them) had been loaded,\nand the make-shift sail unfurled from the high, horizontal yard.  There\nin the shelter of trees, and running parallel to the wind, it rocked\ngently against the mast as the newly tied ends waved fitfully, showing\nevery sign of readiness.\n\nBut Kalus, looking out upon the wide, sweeping waters and thinking of\nthe still greater pool beyond, could not bring himself to force the\nvessel farther.  His emotions were running much too high, and the fear\nof the unknown wrapped about him so thickly that he could not shake off\nits clinging dread and despair.  And despite the presence of the girl\nand the cub, he felt as small and helpless and alone as he ever had.\nCourage alone would not forge this crossing.  He needed guidance as\nwell.\n\nAnd in this he showed not cowardice, but wisdom.  For we are all at the\nmercy of winds and currents we cannot always see or understand, and\nthose who strut about pretending to be in firm control, are usually in\nsuch control all the way past the maw of death, and into the belly of\nunmaking.\n\n'Sylviana,' he said finally.  'It may be foolish.....  I would\nlike to say a prayer first.'\n\nShe was surprised by the request, but in no way opposed.  She felt much\nthe same uncertainty.  So without kneeling or folding hands, whose\ngestures he had never learned, he bowed his head and spoke in deepest\nearnest.\n\n'Nameless God. Perhaps you cannot hear me, or perhaps you laugh at my\nweakness.  I do not wish to ask you this.  But I am just a small and\nsimple man; I cannot control all things.  The waters into which I lower\nthis boat seem cold to me, and I am afraid.  Please, if you care and can\nhear me, bring us safely to the Island.'\n\nHe paused, and for the first time in many days the woman was intently\naware of his existence.  His eyes closed hard and his hands folded\ntogether unknowingly.  This was coming from the heart.\n\n'I do not wish to die,' he continued.  'But if one of us must\ndie.  . then let it be me.  For I could not live without my Sylviana.\nShe is my life.' He choked back wretched tears until he felt a soft\npressure against him, and sweet arms enfolding his gnarled head and\nscarred shoulders.\n\n'Don't,' she said gently, reproaching herself for her coldness.\n'I'm here with you.  I'm with you.'\n\nBut to her surprise he did not return this overture.  Instead he stepped\nback, shook his head severely, and said to her.  'I thank you,\nSylviana.  And I am sorry for this moment of weakness when I must be\nstrong.  But whatever you feel for me, it must not be pity.'\n\n'I only thought---'\n\n'No.  Not now.  The passage we are about to make is perilous, and we\nmust put all our thought and effort into it.  There will be time for\nemotions later.  There is no other way.  Are you prepared?'\n\n..  'Yes.' He moved away from her and lifted the balking cub,\nplacing her in the left-hand shell, where the woman would ride.  'We\nmust be off.'\n\nWithout further speech they pushed the craft the remaining distance,\nthen clambered in to take up their positions near the back of the\nparallel hulls, there both to paddle and steer, using only the awkward,\nbladed shafts that he had made.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAlmost at once Kalus perceived the most serious flaw of his\nconstruction.  The vessel was too heavy.  As soon as they left the\ndreamy backwater he knew it.  The catamaran-like craft responded to the\ncurrent, and as the sail slowly filled, to the wind as well.  But it\noften moved (or failed to move) with a will of its own.  The strokes of\ntheir paddles, and even with the girl joining him for a time in the\nright-hand shell, were barely enough to move them a safe distance from\nthe shore.  A less auspicious beginning was hard to imagine.\n\nAnd the boat was horribly slow to tack, or even move to counter the\nwind.  This concerned Kalus more than anything.  For at the meeting of\nthe Broad River and the River of the North---in the wide water-tract of\nthe delta---the southward flow of the latter would try to carry them\naway from their destination, and out into the open sea.  He had cut the\nhulls as sharply as possible in lieu of a keel, and even leaned them\nslightly outward at the girl's suggestion.  But rudderless, keelless,\nthis was not enough.  The best he could manage with the now deployed\nsteering oar was a straight line eastward, by precious yards slowly\ngaining the center of the stream.  How he would hold it at the meeting\nof the two rivers and the open sea he could not imagine, though he\nexhausted his mind in trying.  His fear and sense of helplessness grew\nwith each passing moment.\n\nStrange to say, Sylviana's impressions at this early stage of their\njourney were nearly the opposite.  To her the waters had a soothing,\nalmost hypnotic effect.  Kalus had not told her the possible\ncomplications of the voyage, being uncertain himself; and for reasons\nall her own she felt a naive (and perhaps misguided) assurance that all\nwould be well.  The river was broad and quiet and tranquil.  The sun\nshone bright in an open sky lightly touched with cirrus, and a great\nadventure was at hand.  Everything was so wide open and free: alive,\nstill young, and in the future.  The world of her past seemed to slip\nbehind with the running coast, so easily, leaving hardly a trace of\nmemory.  But for the presence of Kalus and the pup, she would almost\nhave believed all the tribulations of the War and the Valley to have\nbeen nothing more than a bad dream, from which she was finally waking.\n\nBut the sight of Kalus brought her back: the look of worried\nconsternation, his desperate struggle as he wrestled with the steering\noar.  She watched him for a time, unwilling, and it all came back.\n\nOnly once, on the first day she hunted with him, had she witnessed this\nkind of ruthless determination, and through it, felt the harshness of\nthe world that had shaped such creatures: what he had called the hungry,\nhaunted look of a predator.  So severe were his efforts, so wholly\nsingle-minded, that despite her resolve to face the crossing bravely,\nhis unspoken fears began to rub off on her.  And the rising walls to\neither side of them, the quickening current they now entered, turned the\nworld ominous and forbidding once more.  Almost she resented him for it,\nas if his actions had somehow changed the very nature of the stream.\n\nAs for Kalus, he had said his prayer, and now set out with every weapon\nat his disposal to make it unnecessary.  Self-reliance remained the\ngolden rule of his existence, and he knew that all their lives were in\nhis hands.  The hands of the Nameless, if they existed at all, were a\nthing beyond his (or any man's) control.\n\nBut there was no more time for such thoughts.  The Broad River was broad\nno longer, its shore no longer peaceful and forested.  Great cliffs rose\nup on their right, the last reaches of the granite ridge.  To the north\nthe gray rock was not as steep, but its effect on the river was the\nsame.  All its wide and lazy waters now issued with great force through\na deep, narrow channel scarcely sixty yards wide, falling nearly twice\nthat distance in less than a mile.  The result was a horrific,\nwhite-water chute, now drawing them swiftly to itself.  Kalus' harsh\nvoice cut through the growing roar.\n\n'Tie down the cub,' he commanded, 'And then yourself.  Take\nsolid hold of the paddle; we've got to keep the boat running\nstraight.  And for anything short of death, DON'T LET GO OF THE PADDLE.\nNow!'\n\nHalf stunned, hardly knowing where she was, Sylviana obeyed him.  She\nmade the whimpering pup lie down, and bound her securely.  Then with\nshaking hands she tied the waist-rope about herself.  She straightened\nand took hold of the shaft, both knuckles and face turning coldly white.\nShe glimpsed at Kalus, who nodded gravely.  This danger they both\nunderstood.\n\nSeveral times through the roar and spray of their passage, the boat\ntried to whip about and dash itself against the rocks, or turn sideways\nto be rolled and lost.  But each time, one of the rowers would pull\nforward with desperate strength while the other steered or slapped back\nat the water till the blade finally dug in against the fume: straight\nahead, blocking out the screaming fear, determined.\n\nAnd when the smoking mists cleared and the chaos died away, as the tract\nbroadened and the waters smoothed again just as swiftly, their craft\nremained, unbroken and undaunted.  Kalus gave a cry and shook his fist\nat the sky, while the girl wept.  Another obstacle had failed to defeat\nthem.\n\nBut Kalus was given no time for celebration, and he knew it.  Soon they\nwould enter the delta, and the meeting with the more voluminous North\nRiver.  Immediately he threw down the paddle and took up the longer,\nstouter steering oar.  The sail was heavy and wet, bunched unevenly\nalong the yard; but with supreme, unyielding effort he tried to angle\nthe craft into the wind, which to his dismay now turned nearly straight\nfrom the North.\n\nThe mast gave a troubled groan; the right hull and stern sank\n        dangerously low in the water.  But that was all.  He could\n        change the direction of the prow but not their course.  The\n        hulls' edges simply would not bite and drive them forward.\n        For all his cursing the craft barely held center.  And soon the\n        North River would be upon them.  Sylviana raised her dripping\n        face, her chest heaving both with oxygen and emotion.  And for\n        all her trauma, she felt a swift and stark moment of\n        recognition.  Creeping feelers of memory had been pushing at her\n        consciousness for weeks, since they came to the cove and she\n        caught her first glimpse of the Island in the distance.  Now\n        their message hammered through.\n\nThe island that lay before them, broad and flat across the muddy waters\nof the delta. . .was the ruin of once proud New York City.  The river to\nthe north was the Hudson.\n\nShe gazed at it in a stupor of disbelief.  Not a single scraper touched\nthe skies of Manhattan, only mangled upheavals of stone and steel.  The\nCity had been stripped to a foundation of jagged, broken teeth, then\nleft to endure ten thousand years of weathering.\n\nNEW YORK!  All this time, feeling at the ends of the earth, she had been\nless than twenty miles from the place of her birth.  It was too\nincredible to accept, too unlikely to be anything but the truth.  Her\nspirit swooned at the sight of it.\n\nBut whatever the Christian name of the river they now encountered, to\nKalus it might as well have been the Finger of Satan.  The two currents\nmerged into an uneasy bay, lapping slowly but steadily south-eastward.\nHe redoubled his efforts with both sail and paddle, striking furiously\nat the water till the veins of his forehead seemed ready to burst.  But\nhe could not fight the devilish pull.\n\nAway!  It carried them away!  With all Sylviana's help, he could draw\nno closer to the Island.  The SEA lay beyond, nothing but the sea!  Dear\nGod, it was slow, certain death that awaited them!  In the final measure\nhe had failed, miserably and utterly.  He tore down the Judas sail and\nfell forward and surrendered to despair.\n\nThey were lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 36\n\n\nBut in his despair and hopeless fear of it, Kalus had forgotten (or\nnever knew) that the Sea could also be benevolent.  The Sea, which has\nways and currents of its own, and to whom the incoming waters were\nhardly a ripple of sand in the Sahara.  The fresh water currents\nsubsided, and the waves of the Atlantic took over.  Subtler, more\nprofound, at worst they would have cast them back upon the mainland.\nBut by a distance no greater than the trunk of a fallen tree, he had set\ntheir craft far enough east to be held by the confines of a far greater\nstream.  Sweeping northward along the whole coast of America, washing\neven the pebbles of Nova Scotia before turning eastward toward Britain\nand the European main: the subtly altered, and miraculous Gulf Stream.\n\nFor a long time it seemed the boat moved not at all.  And lost in sorrow\nand dark reverie, none of its passengers stirred.  Only the cub seemed\nalive, whimpering in the wet bottom of the shell until the woman untied\nher.  At length Kalus rose, to apologize with broken heart for killing\nthem all.\n\nBut the words were never spoken.  Somehow the boat had turned about, and\nno longer faced southward.  For a time he wasn't sure, afraid of some\ntrick.....  Yes!  If the vessel moved at all it was north and a little\neast.  They had missed the southwest facet of the Island, but if they\npaddled with strength and good hope, perhaps they might still affect a\nlanding on its more easterly shores.  He was no sailor: he had neither\nthe skill nor the vessel for sailing.  But strength still lived in his\narms, and fires still burned in his heart.  He turned to Sylviana.\n\n'Have you any strength left?' he asked her.  'The current no\nlonger bears us ill, but I think we must still approach the Island on\nour own.'\n\n'I'm exhausted, Kalus.  I feel half drowned.....  Can I rest a\nwhile first?'\n\n'Yes.  If you can steer just a little, I will try to row for both of\nus.' The woman-child set her paddle listlessly in the water, steering\nwith it as best she could, until pride and returning stamina enjoined\nher to paddle on her own.\n\nThey continued on in this way for several hours, resting at intervals,\ngradually, so gradually drawing nearer the rocky shoals of the great\nisland.  Kalus now began to search for a less dangerous strip of beach,\nconfident that if such could be found, by hook or by crook they would\nreach it, and effect some kind of landing.\n\nSo engrossed was he in searching the coast. . .that for a long while he\ndid not notice the great fin that had risen to starboard, and began to\nparallel their course at a distance neither great nor small, cunning\nwith the patience of a predator.  It was not until it turned and began\nto bore in on them, as the girl caught her breath and froze in terror,\nthat he saw it.\n\nBut once seen there was no forgetting.  Black and straight as an ebon\nkeel, it cut through the swells with effortless grace, a torpedoing,\nhalf-defined shadow beneath it.  No small, Child-bearing female this,\nbut a magnificent bull fully thirty feet long, its knifing dorsal as\ntall as a man.\n\nAnd then the blackened knife, like a periscope, sank beneath the level\nof the waves, and did not reappear.  Kalus unfastened his spear, moved\nforward and stood up in the bow---awed, but fiercely determined to\ndefend his own.  All was quiet and still.\n\nThen suddenly (or so it seemed, for the motion was not performed in\nhaste) a great head appeared in front of them, rising perpendicular out\nof the water, lightly touched by the lapping swells.  Above patches of\nwhite, dark eyes studied them darkly.  The orca seemed to be asking\nhimself, almost casually, were they worth the trouble?  Aboard the\nsuddenly diminished craft, the cub set loose a peal of frightened\nbarking, while Kalus showed the whale clearly the point of his spear.\n\nWithout haste the creature returned to a swimming posture, and with a\nrough spout somewhere between laughter and a sneer, began a last,\nintimidating circle---though whether it intended to attack was not\nclear, since it drew no closer.\n\nThen to the bewilderment of the company another, smaller fin appeared,\nas if to join in the kill.  But it was not so.  Coming between the bull\nand the tiny ship, the female nudged him almost angrily, then butted him\noutright in the side.  The male at last relented.  The two swam off,\nleaving behind them a riddle that only seemed complicated, because of\nits simplicity.\n\nPerhaps nowhere else in Nature was the difference between male and\nfemale more pronounced, or more in harmony with their world.  They were\na mated pair: the bull nearly twice her size, aggressive and\nindomitable.  And the female: more subtle, more compassionate (if that\nis the right word), strong and sure enough to act on both convictions.\nEither one alone could be powerful and self-sufficient.  Together,\nnothing could withstand them, true champions of the Sea.\n\nIt was Sylviana who spoke first, feeling more acutely the need to talk\nthat comes after tension and danger.  Kalus, conversely, remained with\nhis jaw set, trembling and pale, but with the spear clasped firmly in\nhis hand.  He did not at first seem to hear her.\n\n'I was never so scared in my life,' she said.  No reply.\n'Kalus?'\n\nHe turned to her, not seeming to know who she was, then answered with\nhalf his attention, perhaps a bit coldly.  'Not even before the giant\nspider?'\n\n..  'No.  Not really.  Then I didn't believe what was\nhappening.....  Are you all right?' At last his eyes and mind\nfocused, and he too felt the need.\n\n'I have been better.  How many shocks am I supposed to be able to\nface in one day?  I feel I've lived a year in just these few\nhours.' He released a sigh, almost a groan, laying aside for a time\nhis resolve to keep an emotional distance from her. . .until she\ndecided.  'I'm sorry for what I said about the spider.  It was\nthoughtless.'\n\n'It's all right.  You're allowed to be human, you know.'\n\n>From the tone more than her words, Kalus knew that he had stung her,\n and that she did not quite forgive him.  Again he felt that she was\n holding him responsible for the harshness of his world, as if it were\n somehow his fault.  Again the chasm opened between them, and now he was\n too tired to fight it.  Imperceptibly he shook his head, breathed out,\n and returned his attention to the shoreline.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThey were now less than a mile out, and the half-forgotten, ruinous\nlandscape once more absorbed them.\n\nAll was flat on a large scale, and crumpled on a small: hard, bitter\nrock like cubes set on edge, careening madly this way and that.  Within\nits valleys were patches of earth, green with grass and weeds, punctured\never and again by corroded girders and iron masonry-bars, to which clung\nbits of ornamental stone and naked, crumbling concrete.  Trees were\nscarce and never large, their greatest numbers clustered in isolated\npatches a short distance from the coast, which seemed to have received\nthe largest deposits of earth.\n\nSylviana easily saw what she had always known, that the skyline of\nManhattan had been built upon solid bedrock.  For this reason alone had\nthe Island survived at all, blasted as it must have been by successive\nnuclear explosions.  And with this she realized suddenly where the\ndeposits of earth had come from.  Besides the fact that the continental\ncoast had been ravaged.....  Long Island was gone!  Just GONE.  Nothing\nbut ocean stretched eastward as far as the eye could see.\n\nAnd this made her see, vividly, what she had hitherto thought of and\nimagined as little as possible.  While her father had whisked her away\nand put her to sleep, like an enchanted princess, in the Canadian\nRockies, an entire world had been pounded and burned to death.  And the\nremote, less habited places of the globe had been no better off, their\nchildren, both man and animal alike, left to die and distort in the\nslower ravages of radiation poisoning.  She did not even know how her\nfather had protected her from the fallout, or indeed, if he had been\nable.  Horrible thought!  Would she one day die of cancer, too?\n\nThe only comfort, and it wasn't much, was that it had all happened so\nlong ago: that the hurts had long since been healed.  But what was Time,\nreally?  Had the Island forgotten?  The grim hunks of marble, were they\nnot tombstones, the remains of a pillaged graveyard?  Were the gnarled\ntrees not alive with the ghosts of the past?  She could not elude the\npain, or the bludgeoning sense of complicit guilt.\n\nHad he wanted to, Kalus could have torn her apart in those moments\nmerely by pointing, as if to say.  'Is this the humanity you mock me\nwith? Is this the world and way of life I should mourn?' But he said\nnothing because he, too, seeing her spirit crushed so completely, felt\nthrough her the reality and pain of the score of books she had read to\nhim, and realized that every book ever written was but a grain of sand\nin the vast desert of human struggles and emotions.  Six billion\nintelligent beings at once sharing the globe. . .and then this.  He\nwanted to wrap her in his arms, and shield her forever from the horror.\nBut he could not.  'I wish this day would end,' was the best he\ncould manage.\n\nBut the day would not end.  For good or ill, there remained yet one more\nscene for them to witness.  And this, a vision of the inextinguishable\nnature of life, was in that hour both a joy and an indescribable sadness\nto behold.  As the boat rounded a high promontory, a hidden inlet was\nrevealed to them.  Sylviana gasped, and Kalus lifted his spear in alarm.\nBut there was no danger.  No physical danger at least.\n\nThirty-three naked human forms sat, or stood, or lay placidly like seals\namong the rocks and mossy earth of a steep embankment, with the ruins of\nthe United Nations building standing in broken silhouette behind them.\nAnd before them, in the deep and still waters of the inlet, a dozen fins\nand sleek backs rested peacefully while others moved, as if on guard,\namong the waters farther out.  It was impossible that the whales, at\nleast, should be unaware of their slowly logging craft; but apparently\nsome understanding had been reached.  The guards came no closer, and the\nChildren showed no fear.\n\nAnd children they truly were: none exceeded the age of sixteen.  Their\nbodies had no hair, only the scruffy heads and thick eyebrows, the\nstraggle of mane down neck and spine---all curly blond and brown.  Their\ncream-colored skin was smooth and tough, and the eyes of all resembled\nmore closely the eyes of a statue than any human's.  Indeed, their\nvery placidness was almost cold, animal in its indifference.  Upon\ncloser inspection an abnormality of the hands and feet could be seen.\nThe fingers were long, bony and webbed, like the sea-creatures they\nwere, the feet slightly longer and similarly arrayed.\n\nBut in the face of all contradictory evidence, Sylviana clung with\nsudden conviction to the belief (perhaps unfounded) that inside them\nremained some spark of humanity, and a soul that might somehow be\nwakened.\n\nBut who would wake it?  They had tarried here in their winter home long\nenough, and must soon return to the seal rich waters of the North.\nPerhaps they would return again in autumn; perhaps they would move\non. Though she could not have known this, Sylviana hung her head in\nunknown harmony.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAt last as the day wore thin, they reached a tenable stretch of beach,\nand in the failing light safely landed the water-soaked craft.  The\nsmallish waves could not overturn its heavy bulk, which now served them.\nThey dragged it as far ashore as they could, which wasn't far, and\nlit a fire to replace the sunken sun.  There in the lee of a group of\nrocks they huddled together and slept in the sand, unable yet to think\nof tomorrow.\n\nThey slept, and dreamed, in sorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 37\n\n\nThe next day brought unexpected hope.  As the sun rose, dazzling, across\nthe vast Atlantic, one of its urchins stood up among the wave-ends and\nstepped cautiously ashore.\n\nAlerted by the sixth sense that every hill-man must possess, Kalus\nopened his eyes and remained perfectly still.  There in the clear light\nof morning, he witnessed a scene that recalled to him the simple act of\nkindness that had changed his life forever.  Quietly he woke the girl,\nknowing that she needed this sight as much as he.  Silently, together\nthey watched, touched by the eternal resilience of life, where nothing\nis new under the sun, and every sunrise is the first for some newborn\ncreature.\n\nA small boy, perhaps four, stood close to the water's edge, holding\nsomething in his hand.  The cub, having woken before them, remained in\nher alert, quizzical posture, a short distance from him up the sandy\nincline.  As the boy took a few steps nearer she stood up, but did not\nbark or growl.  Perhaps it was because they were of a kind, and\nunderstood each other without the dimness of fear.  Or perhaps because\nthey felt the simple affinity which all young creatures share, not yet\nhardened and made cruel by their elders and their world.\n\nThe Child continued to advance, glancing sidelong at the others: aware\nof their presence, but intent upon his mission.  At last only a few feet\nseparated boy and wolf.  Squatting, he put the partly eaten fish in the\nsand in front of her, and took a step back.  The pup came closer,\nsniffed at it briefly, then began to eat.  Her tail wagged in childish\ncontentment.\n\nAnd then the miracle occurred.  The Child laughed, throwing his arms up\nto the sky.  If he had known the word \u0091hooray', he would certainly\nhave used it.\n\nSuch sweet music!  Sylviana thought her heart would break for it, and\nKalus remembered for the first time without bitterness, the smile and\ntrust of young Shama.\n\nThe girl sat up; she couldn't help herself.  At once the child\nsprinted back to the sea, diving into the waters as naturally as a newly\nhatched sea turtle, thinking no more of the ensuing swim than a bird\nthinks of flight.  A short distance out an impatient, affectionate orca\nrose between his waiting legs, and carried him home on her back.\nSylviana watched in weary peace, with dreamy eyes thinking how sweet it\nmight be to one day have a child of her own.  Until something in the\nemptiness of the beach arrested her.\n\n'Kalus, the boat. It's gone!'\n\nAnd so it was.  He rose beside her, and pointed to a spot on the\nnortheast horizon.  There, riding ever lower in the waves, floated the\ncraft he had so agonizingly constructed.  She was appalled by his\napparent calmness.\n\n'You've got to DO something.  You've got to swim out and get\nit.' But he only shook his head, clearing his eyes with the back of\nhis wrist.\n\n'Would you have me drowned for a piece of wood?'\n\n'But how can you be so indifferent?'\n\n'I am not indifferent, if only for the pains it cost me.  But I have\nnot yet given up hope that the boat will return to us.  The tide took it\nout, perhaps the waves will bring it back farther north.  And if it is\nlost, I think I can now construct a better one, more worthy of our\ntrust.'\n\n'But you worked so hard to bring us here.'\n\n'Yes,' he said.  'I raged at both the sea and wind, cursing\nthem and calling them demons.  Then, when I surrendered in despair,\nsomething pulled us through, and gave us another chance.  We are far out\non this limb, Sylviana.  We must believe in something.  I will trust in\nthe Tao that I have found, and which in all my life, has never fully\nbetrayed me.'\n\nBut now he drew back.  His eyes grew hazy, and far less confident.  He\npaused as if in fear, for all his resolve, at the words he must now say\nto her.\n\n'I give you your freedom, also.....  I LOVE you.  But whatever is to\ncome, I cannot chain you to me.  You must return to me, if you would, of\nyour own free will.'\n\nBUT THIS IS AWFUL, she thought.  HIS TIMING IS TERRIBLE.  She fought\nback the urge to say, 'And what if I don't want my freedom?  Did\nit ever occur to you that I might feel the same way about you?'\nInstead she said nothing.  So be it.\n\nAnd here Kalus made a fundamental error of human psychology.  For while\non an intellectual level a woman may be pleased at the prospect of her\n\u0091freedom', on an instinctive or emotional level, and with a man\nshe loves, such words are a source of deep doubt and insecurity.  If\nKalus truly wanted and needed her, why wasn't he willing to guard her\nlove, even fight for it?  Didn't he care anymore?\n\nBut all such thoughts passed through her below the surface only.  Her\none concern now (so she told herself) was for their welfare, which he\nseemed to be taking far too lightly.\n\n'And what if we're stranded here for a month?  Our supplies\nwon't last half that long.'\n\n'I don't think we're stranded, or alone.....  I saw the lights\nagain last night.'\n\nThese words worked on her system like an electric shock.\n\n'What!  Why didn't you wake me?'\n\n'You needed sleep more than water, or even air. Please don't fight\nwith me, Sylviana.  Much could happen this day.  I don't want it to\nbegin with a rift between us.'\n\nShe paced back and forth in the deep sand, her strides sinking, failing\nto carry her any meaningful distance before doubling back.  It was not\nanger she felt now, but fear.\n\nBecause she could not yet face the prospect of finding other men and\nwomen like herself.  Through all their preparations she had only half\nbelieved it, deep down.  Yet now the most terrible question of her life\nrose in unshrouded hugeness before her:\n\nHAD OTHERS OF HER KIND SURVIVED THE DESTRUCTION?  Or was she truly alone\nwith Kalus, who she seemed to know less and less each day?  And why did\na part of her WANT to be alone with him?  She could not face it.  If\nafter all her hopes and fears it came to nothing.....\n\n'All right,' she said, trying to calm herself.  'All right.\nWhat do we do now?'\n\n'Build a fire, eat and drink, then move inland carefully.  We\ndon't know yet what we'll find.  I think I can trace the source of\nthe beams well enough.  The Island is large, but not infinite.  Only its\nuneven surface makes it appear so.  If we miss on the first try, or even\nthe second, we will be closer to the source; and we can trace the beams\nby night, if need be.'\n\nBut for all her need of nourishment, Sylviana's knotting stomach\nwould not think of food.  'We've got to go now!  I'm sorry,\nKalus, but I can't possibly wait another minute.'\n\nHe started to overrule her, then checked himself, secretly bitter at her\neagerness.  'Very well,' he said.  'But we go slowly, and with\nour weapons in our hands.  I'll take no chances in this wretched\nplace.'\n\nHis mood had changed abruptly.  He too felt the specter of the waiting\nunknown, though his hopes and fears were nearly opposite; and he became\nonce more the untrusting hill-man.  He lifted his spear, jaw set against\nthe dark uncertainty that awaited them.\n\nSylviana strode ahead anxiously.  Together they cleared the sand, and\nclimbed the first slanting rise.  It dipped, and another rose before\nthem, frail earth punctured by an agony of stone and steel.  They\nadvanced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 38\n\n\nInland the earth grew somewhat less troubled.  The undulating cross of\nridges became smoother and more widely spaced, with patchwork valleys\nsinking in their midst.  The scarred remains of buildings were also less\nfrequent, though here and there an inexplicable mound of slag, half\novergrown like an ancient, impoverished barrow, rose to recall the\nunsleeping dead that still walked there.\n\nSylviana was soon pale and exhausted, and Kalus could no longer indulge\nher almost distracted urge to keep moving.  Almost angry, he made her\nsit down in the grim shade of a leering monolith.  For the day had grown\nhot and humid, with hardly a breeze to calm the reeling senses, or break\nthe spell of sunny, smiling death that seemed to hang in the air around\nthem like a witch's curse.  A delirium of fever had come over her\nfrom the tumultuous passage of the rapids and the sea, but in her\nexcited state she was not calm or rational enough to realize it.\n\nKalus gave her water and tried to cool her burning forehead, telling her\nin no uncertain terms that they would not go one step further until she\nhad caught her breath, and let him do something about the gash on her\nknee---the result of a fall---which she kept insisting was nothing.\n\nNOTHING?\n\nBut she hardly heard him, unable to master her emotions.  She knew where\nshe was, mentally, but this drab physical assurance helped not at all.\nWhy in the name of all that was dark, mysterious and unfathomable was\nshe here, ten thousand years removed from the time and world she had\nknown?  And who was this half wild man who tended her, and the\nbewildered animal that licked her hand in half-formed worry and\nconfusion?  KALUS.  ALASKA. NEW YORK.  What were they but names?  What\nwas this place, truly, but the untouchable Land of the Dead, which the\nsun had somehow invaded.\n\nAs her breath came easier the thoughts slowed and became less feverish,\nbut did not change in character.  Her body ached.  She felt lonely and\nnumb and afraid.  Yet somehow she grew calmer, feeling that if once she\nlooked into Kalus' eyes the world would again become comprehensible,\nif still cruel and unfair.\n\nBut by dint of some perverse pride she refused to do so.  She would not\nbe a slave to any man, or concede her spirit to a Nature so base and\nsingle-minded.  Whatever that might mean.  She did not know.\n\nAnd as soon as the slightest strength returned to her limbs she was up\nagain, fighting the stubborn rush of dizziness, assuring the nagging\nvoice of caution that she was ready to go on.\n\nKalus was truly worried, himself not immune to the alien strangeness of\nthe place.  He did not know what waited over the next hill, the next\nseries of hills, or how with his primitive weapons alone he would\nprotect them.  For he had seen the wisp of smoke, the kind that only man\ncan make: the white smoke of intentional fire, though he dared not speak\nof it to the girl.\n\nAll seemed lost and out of control.  He wanted to yield and to trust,\nand if it had been his life alone he might have done so.  But the more\nthe woman-child railed and pulled away from him, the more he knew that\nshe was family in the deepest sense.  Nothing she could do or say made\nhim feel any less bound to her, one with her, or responsible for her\nsafety and well-being.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.  She had begun of her own to climb the\nuneven slant.  He could either follow behind or forcibly stop her; there\nwas no third alternative.  He ran to stand beside her, taking her arm as\ngently as he could.\n\n'Sylviana, please.  Let me lead the way.  I do not think it is far,\nbut we must be careful.  Please.'\n\nShe finally looked at him, and remembered.  She wanted to collapse in\nhis arms and weep.  She wanted to say that nothing else mattered.  She\nwanted to go back to their life by the sea and never again think of\nislands and men.  But she could not.  She took his hand firmly in hers,\nkissed it, and yielded to what had to be.  She must go on, and he must\nlead her.  As he must somehow understand.\n\nTogether, more slowly, they dipped two more valleys and climbed a final\nridge.  They reached the top of it, Kalus for some reason hugging close\nto the shadows of a stunted oak.....\n\nThere, in that small recession, their lives changed forever.  An outdoor\ncooking fire, a row of low stone buildings.  Two women and a man moving\nabout a table with plates and cups.  And not dressed like animals, but\nmen.  Overalls, a blue NASA worksuit, an Oriental dress.  Sylviana\nlooked on, not surprised she told herself, then felt the ground rush up\nto meet her.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus caught her beneath the arms and pulled her under the partial cover\nof the tree.  But it was too late.  They had been seen.  Without audible\nword or gesture, the three stopped what they were doing and began to\nmove toward them.  One, at least, had seen her fall, and they began to\nrun, thinking she was wounded or sick.\n\nBut they were brought up short by an imposing figure with a sword, and a\nhalf grown wolf which seemed unsure whether to welcome their aid, or\nprotect its fallen mistress from them.  It growled and lunged\nuncertainly, looking over at the man, who remained silent.  There was a\nmoment of mutual indecision and fear.\n\nBut then the woman in the dark silk dress, lit with patterns of gold and\nlilac, stepped forward.  Her appearance was strange to him, the\nshimmering black hair and olive skin seeming more exotic even than his\nfirst memories of Sylviana.  Her eyes were calm and reassuring, but not\nnaive.  She put a hand to her chest, then opened it toward him in what\nhe clearly recognized as a gesture of truce.\n\nHer stillness, and the way she looked at him without wavering, told\nKalus more than any other sign that she meant them no harm.  He lowered\nhis sword and said simply.\n\n'Do we speak the same language?'\n\nShe smiled sadly.  'Yes, I believe we do.' At this the others came\nforward.\n\n'Is the girl all right?' asked the man.  He started to move\ntowards her, but Kalus' rugged frame interposed.\n\n'She is exhausted and feverish, and startled by the sight of you.\nShe is of your kind, I think.  I am not.'\n\nTaking this in officiously, the man once more addressed him, offering\nhis hand, which Kalus did not take.  But he persisted.  'I'm Paul\nMcIntyre, flight surgeon.....  I'm a doctor, son.  Won't you let\nme help your friend?'\n\nBut for all his relief and desire to yield, Kalus found it hard to let\nanother man touch her, even in this simple way.  Again the young woman\ninterceded.  She laid a soft and delicate hand on his, and looked him\nfull in the face with brilliant, almond eyes, drawn to a gentle point at\neach corner.\n\n'It's all right,' she said.  'You're among friends.\nWon't you let us help you?' Her voice and manner were so alluring\nthat for a moment he forgot all else.  He looked down at Sylviana, half\nashamed of what the Oriental had aroused in him, and said quietly.\n\n'So long as you are gentle.  I think she just needs rest.'\n\nThe doctor was already at work, lifting her off the hard roots to lean\nback against his thighs.  Then reaching inside a black bag that he had\nbrought, he broke open a pouch of smelling salts and moved it back and\nforth under her nose.  Her head stirred, then turned away in distaste.\nShe regained full consciousness to find herself lying, literally, in the\nstrange older man's lap.  Forgetting that this was what her mind had\nsought, she cried out instinctively.\n\n'Kalus!' And in a moment he was beside her.  'Kalus,' she\npleaded.  'Is it all right?  Are we safe here?' He looked hard at\nthe doctor.\n\n'Yes, my Sylviana.  I think that we are.'\n\nShe studied the man once more.  'Is it true?  Are you really with\nNASA?  This isn't a dream?'\n\n'Yes, I'm with NASA.  Second manned expedition to Mars---we never\nmade it.  But there's time for all that later.  Right now we're\ngoing to get some fluids into you, and give you something for the fever.\nThen I'd prescribe bed rest, and a further examination.  Young man,\nwill you help me---'\n\nBut before he could finish the girl had turned her face into his\nstomach, and was crying like a child.  He stroked her hair easily and\nnaturally, speaking words of comfort and assurance.  As the man-child\nlooked on and felt lost.\n\nAt length she grew quieter. Kalus lifted her in his willing arms, and\ndespite all objections, carried her himself to a bed in the cool\ndarkness of one of the huts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 39\n\n\nAll that afternoon Sylviana remained in the hut, sleeping, drinking\nfruit juice, and luxuriating in the incredible comfort of a real bed.\nTwice the doctor came in to check on her, and each time she made him sit\ndown on the edge of the bed and talk to her, about what it didn't\nmatter, just to hear his soothing voice that spoke of a world she knew\nand trusted, and to feel she was no longer alone: that it was all right\nto be a needing child.  And after a time his words became like music, a\nlullaby, and she would slip back into untroubled sleep, her hand\nunconsciously resting on his.  Then he would gently lift it and set it\nbeside her, and smiling, rise to tell the others that she would be fine.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus would have remained beside her door all day in silent watch, but\nthey would not let him.  Though all at the noon meal of the partly\ngathered colony were asked to let the newcomers be, by evening their\ncuriosity could no longer be disciplined.  He was asked to join them for\nsupper, the first of the year to be eaten outdoors, and it was all but\nimpossible to refuse.\n\nSo as the remaining men and women returned from their various\nlabors---there were fourteen in all---Kalus took his place at the far\nend of the long table, not to distinguish himself, but because he did\nnot wish to sit closely huddled among creatures he did not know.  And\nthough by all appearances they seemed the best that modern man had to\noffer (in fact they were), he could not help remembering the tales of\nhuman treachery that Sylviana had read to him; and half fearfully, half\nangrily, he kept waiting for some sign of it to surface.\n\nBut it never did.  These people seemed to genuinely care about and\nsupport each other, and to respect his wish to be silent.  And all would\nhave gone well but for an incident which none could have foreseen, and\nfor which Kalus himself could not be blamed.\n\nSylviana, hearing the sounds of conversation and real companionship,\ndressed herself quickly, and against doctor's orders, came out to\njoin them.  She was welcomed heartily, and given a place near the head\nof the table.  And all seemed well enough.\n\nBut as the dishes were being cleared and those still seated began to\npush back their chairs and settle themselves more comfortably, Sylviana\nbegan to tell her story in abbreviated form.  Then Kalus saw that the\ntall, straight man at the head of the table---their leader, he\nperceived---kept staring at her in growing agitation.  In truth the look\nwas not one of hunger, but of intense curiosity, and of a man racking\nhis brains for some distant memory.  But Kalus could not know this.\nFinally the man interrupted her, saying plainly.\n\n'Sylviana.  What is your last name?'\n\nTo her amazement, she had to think for a moment.  She hadn't used it\nfor what seemed, and was, an eternity.\n\n'Matheson.'\n\n'And was your father Guy Matheson, the physiologist?'\n\n'Yes!  Did you know him?'\n\n'Know him?  Why girl, I even know YOU, though I'm sure you\nwouldn't remember.  I worked with your father for the better part of\na year, trying to smooth out some wrinkles in the cryogenics and\nlife-support systems needed for longer, deep Space voyages.  You were\nonly eight or nine at the time, but I've thought of you at least a\nhundred times since, and wondered what became of you.  There was such\nsimple joy in everything you did.....'\n\nAnd as a look of slow recognition and wonder came over the young\nwoman's face, the normally reserved Mission Commander was overcome by\nemotion.  He stood up, telling her to do the same.  He moved closer, and\nembraced her heartily.\n\n'Dear God, it's good to see you.  To know that you're still\nalive.'\n\nThis was too much for Kalus.  The chair on which he sat flew backward\nand the sword leapt from its sheath, in the upward swing knocking hard\nagainst the bottom of the table.  Jolted, the company turned to face\nhim, as to contain his animal passion he took a step backward and\nbreathed heavily.  But the tip of his sword he pointed at the leader in\na rage, saying with disciplined fire.\n\n'LET HER GO.'\n\nBut none were more startled, or dismayed, than Sylviana.  'Kalus!'\nshe demanded, as if he were an errant child.  'Put the sword away.\nCan't you see these people mean us no harm?  This man was a friend of\nmy father's.  And of mine.'\n\nHe stood pale in the artificial light, his limbs trembling and his mind\nconfused.  He lowered the sword, and slowly realized that he had been a\nfool, and disgraced them both.  He hung his head, and colored with\nshame.\n\n'I'm sorry.  I don't understand these things.....  I am a wild,\nfoolish man.  But when you touched my woman---'\n\nHe looked up quickly, to find his worst fears confirmed.  Sylviana had\nwinced at being called his woman.  He felt a part of himself dying.\nPerhaps he overreacted, but it was what he truly felt.\n\n'I am a fool.  I will leave you.' But a firm voice broke him off,\nthat of Kataya, the Oriental.\n\n'NO,' she said.  'Don't ever apologize for who and what you\nare. Ever.' He looked up to see her standing.  'Commander\nStenmark, and Sylviana, too, must share the blame for this.' There\nwas a note of reproach in her voice, though she had not intended it.\n'You reacted in the way your world has taught you, a world that none\nof us can know, and in which there is no shame.  You are welcome among\nus, and you will stay.'\n\nThere was an awkward silence.  Then the Commander, who was in fact their\nleader, remembered himself and spoke reassuringly, voicing perhaps the\nsentiments of all.\n\n'She's right, young man.  God help us, she's always right.'\n\nWith this the tension faded.  The doctor, who to this point had been\nlenient with his patient, now called her visit to an end.\n\n'You, young lady,' he said in paternal tones, 'Are supposed to\nbe in bed.  As for the rest of you gawkers,' he added with mock\nseverity, 'We can put Kalus under the microscope tomorrow, and then\nheaven help him!  You're in a colony of scientists, my boy, and\nyou'll get no rest until we're as bored with you as we are with\neach other.  Enough now!  Break up this little party or I'll come up\nwith a new vaccine and inject you where you sit.  Literally.'\n\nWith this, chuckling, responding in kind, the company began to disperse\nto the various huts.  The Commander approached Kalus, shook his hand,\nand apologized personally, while the hill-man repeated his own\ncontrition.\n\nAt last, looking down, Kalus found himself seated at the table alone,\nhis thoughts as dark and empty as the place itself.  Sylviana had been\nashamed of him.  ASHAMED.  As if the past meant nothing, had never\nhappened.\n\nHe lay wearily on his arms, trying to understand.  How had it all\nhappened so fast?  The colony had absorbed her like water into sand,\nleaving nothing for him.  Even the cub had gone in to sleep beside her.\n\nTo sleep beside her!  How acutely he would feel the absence of her body\ntonight.  He felt himself out of place: in the wrong tale, immersed in\nchapters and characters that all around him understood, but which were\nto him as incomprehensible as the Valley had been to Sylviana.\n\nBut this new life would not have seemed so bleak, perhaps even pleasant,\nif while it slowly took possession of him, he was not losing the one\nthing in all the world that truly mattered: the love of the woman he had\nonce called his.  HIS.....\n\nHe felt soft fingers touch the back of his head, then slide downward and\nbegin to massage his neck and aching shoulders.  He did not move,\nknowing by touch alone that it was not his mate.  He knew it was Kataya,\nbut was too exhausted, both physically and emotionally, to react one way\nor the other.\n\nBut to the watching figure in the doorway, there was no such\nambivalence.  Sylviana was furious.  How different when the shoe is on\nthe other foot, was a thought she strangled as soon as it began to form\ninside her.\n\nShe had gone to the spacious bed, surrounded by things she thought\nmissing from her life, only to experience the same emptiness and sense\nof loss at not feeling the familiar body beside her, and having no one\nto tell of her contentment.  She tried to shrug it off and just sleep.\nBut she had slept off and on all day, and felt her weariness replaced by\na kind of yearning restlessness.  PROBABLY JUST MY CONSCIENCE, she had\ntold herself.  And with this the gentler part of her nature had begun to\nrebel, saying that Kalus was a kind and decent man, who deserved better\nthan to be spoken to and treated as if he were some kind of savage.\n\nBut these gentle, Christian sentiments were too easily dismissed.  He\nhad acted abominably, her harder self retorted, and fully deserved the\nscorn that she had shown him.\n\nAnd perhaps this was the problem---trying to make herself think more\nfondly of him through the mind.  Because gratitude and compassion are\nnot lasting in love, while instinct and self-fulfillment never fade.  If\nshe could simply have admitted to herself that she missed the security\nand intimacy of lying in his arms, and that the crowning pleasure of her\nnew-found happiness would have been to open herself to him, both body\nand spirit, she could have put aside the hopeless tangle of her emotions\nand simply gone to him, and taken him to her, and renewed again the bond\nof true lovers.  As it was she could only toss restlessly, then get up\nand pace in frustration.\n\nAt length she had decided to go to him (or merely allowed the greater\npart of herself to act), telling herself that she should at least say\ngoodnight, and give him the chance to make it up to her.  But as she\npassed through the hallway and began to enter the dimly lit compound,\nshe saw a male figure hunched at the table, and another, female form\nbehind, touching him.  Thinking it one of the other couples, she drew\nback into the shadows of the doorframe.  But as her eyes grew more\naccustomed to the half-light, she saw plainly the scene laid out before\nher.\n\nAnd there she remained, her mind and heart a whirlwind of conflicting\nimpulses.  She wanted to rush at the woman and scratch her eyes out.\nShe wanted to walk up calmly and ask, 'Have you quite finished with\nmy husband?' Her HUSBAND?  She wanted to scream at Kalus, to\napologize for being cold, to seduce him, and to have him out of her life\nforever.\n\nBut she did none of the things, remaining stock still in the doorway.\nShe forced herself to be calm, and tried to rationalize.  Why was she so\nupset?  After all, what had he done?  And why did it matter to her\nanyway?  She wanted to break away, and put the whole thing from her\nmind.  But she couldn't.  She had to see what he would do.\n\nAfter a time Kataya sensed the man-child's indifference, or at least\nhis unwillingness to yield to her.  This did not cool her half-admitted\ndesire for him, but only made it more patient, tactful.  She moved to\nsit in a corner chair, beside him.\n\n'Why so glum, Kalus?  Or are you just ignoring me?'\n\n'I am sorry, Kataya.  It's not you.  I just\nfeel. . .overwhelmed.' And with this, he surrendered.\n\n'How so?'\n\n'So much has happened,' he began, feeling as he said the words the\nbewilderment that lay beneath all other emotions.  'Three weeks ago\nSylviana and I made love as if there was nothing else in the world.  And\nfor us, there wasn't.  Three months ago we struggled together against\nthe Cold World, in a place we called our home.  At the time it often\nseemed like Hell, but it brought us closer than you can possibly\nimagine.  And three days ago.  Three days.  I lived more or less in the\nland where I was born, with paradise at my fingers.'\n\n'Then why did you leave?'\n\n'Because I couldn't keep lying to her, that we were alone.....\nShe isn't like me.  She needs the company of her own kind.' He\nspoke now more to himself, and to the darkness.  She was silent for a\nmoment, her own feelings and experience submerged.\n\n'And now?'\n\n'That's just it.  I can't bring it all up to now.  It's like\na great wave that just goes on and on.  The voyage here. . .sweet Jesus.\nAnd just this morning I held her close while she slept, then woke her to\na sight that broke both our hearts, and opened to us the possibility of\na child of our own.' Again she felt him drifting, into a world that\ndid not even recognize her existence.  'And now all of you, a flood\nof strange names and faces, and emotions I don't know how to read.\nIt just goes on and on, with Sylviana slipping farther and farther\naway.'\n\n'All waves must eventually end, Kalus.  This one will, too. And when\nyou find yourself safely landed among us?' She hesitated.  'And if\nthe girl is no longer yours?  What then?'\n\n'I cannot even think of that. It would be the end of everything, of\nlife itself.'\n\nKataya hung her head.  WHY MUST IT ALWAYS BE SO?\n\nKalus saw this gesture of defeat and knew, for all his confusion and\ndespair, that he had been selfish, and forgotten her.  There in the\nstillness of night he felt her presence acutely, felt the soul inside\nher and knew she was as achingly alive as himself.  And the feelings\nthis knowledge aroused in him both troubled and comforted his own\nloneliness.  He put his hand beneath her chin and raised the lovely,\noval face to look at him.\n\n'You are very beautiful, Kataya.  I have chosen Sylviana, but you are\na woman that a man could truly love.' She wrapped her hand about his\nwrist, whispered something in a strange language, then broke off and\nquickly walked away.  He watched her go in sadness.\n\nAll this time Sylviana had watched them, unable to hear what was said,\nimagining the worst.  Then she saw him lift her face to his, and whisper\ntender words which should have been hers alone.\n\nConfused and angry, she stormed back into her room.  Confused and weary,\nKalus spread himself on the ground like an animal, missing them both,\nand staring at the stars.  Confused and bitter, Kataya swore she would\nnot let herself want him, and be hurt yet again and again.\n\nAll three slept alone, finding no shelter from the mocking night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 40\n\n\nThe next day was Sunday, and the one day a week which the hard-working\ncolonists had agreed to set aside as a respite from their labors.  Those\nwho worked the fields, those who maintained the power and water supply,\nthose who scavenged the city for underground vaults filled with books\nand computer records, as well as those who performed the experiments,\ntranslations, and radio communications (never answered) which were vital\nto the group's morale and sense of purpose, all surrendered for this\none day the businesslike security of endeavor, to think and contemplate\nlike the first pious Jews, who had looked to the heavens and tried to\nunderstand their world.\n\nIn the hushed morning they gathered for the non-denominational service,\nChristian, Jew, Buddhist and atheist alike, spread about the candle-lit\nconference room.  And it was here that Sylviana first felt the depth of\nloneliness and sorrow that this handful of survivors carried with them\nas inescapably as a damaged organ, or the memory of an amputated limb.\nAnd she realized that all their surface carelessness and ease, all the\njokes about being bored with one another, were mere facade, the\nnecessary illusions of commonplace existence.  It was clear in this\nsmall chapel of honesty, that they not only loved and respected one\nanother, but clung to each other, and held the value of each human life\nhigh above any other aspiration.\n\nCommander Stenmark in particular she watched, and began to wonder at\nthis grizzled pioneer whose age was so incongruous to all around him,\nmost of whom were under forty.  And during the moment of silent prayer\nshe had to restrain with difficulty her own emotions, as she saw the\nsame face that could be so still and dispassionate, draw close over the\nfervently folded hands with tears of age, and thanks, and tired\nresponsibility flowing like the sudden, relentless Spring.  And it was\nwith warmth and a further shock that she realized this outpouring was\nfor her: that something, someone dear to him had been spared.  She had\nnever felt so honored.\n\nWhen the service ended they moved outside, and after a light meal,\nspread themselves more comfortably on the grassy earth of a clear space\nat one end of the compound, backed by a gentle rise and a single, lithe\nand undistorted maple.  This in preparation for what remained to them\nthe greatest pleasure (and diversion) in life.  Learning.\n\nSylviana's story was fascinating, what they had heard of it the night\nbefore, but it was Kalus whom they longed to interrogate.  For here was\nan anthropologist's dream: a young man who had lived among throwback\nNeanderthals, who had carved his existence, without medicine or steel,\nfrom the harsh realities of a world in which Man not only held no\nexalted place, but was on the contrary smallish and ill-equipped, as\nlikely to be hunted as hunter.  And the fact that he himself had emerged\nfrom the recessed traits of three hundred generations, to be born fully\nhuman.....  They knew nothing yet of the Machine or the Visitors, only\nthat for most of his life Kalus had possessed no spoken language, had\nbeen an outcast and object of suspicion because of his appearance and\ngreater intelligence, had met and shared deepest communion with a young\nwoman and fellow creature of the twenty-first century.  And for now,\nthis was more than enough.\n\nDr. David Rawlings, cell biologist, spoke first, a strongly built,\nintense black man in his mid thirties.  Apparently the least abashed of\nthe company, he assumed the role he had chosen for himself, and which\nthe others now expected and took for granted.\n\n'Well,' he said, moving to stand at the fore of the group.  'I\nsuppose first we should tell you something of ourselves.' And without\nthe wasted words of diplomacy, he did.\n\n'You see before you the surviving crew members of Virgo II, the\nmanned exploration of Mars.  Two years into the flight, and not yet\ntwo-thirds of the way there, we received a delayed signal from earth,\nand at an undesignated interval.  The bloody butchers who called\nthemselves our leaders had finally done it: missiles and satellite\nstations vomiting their nuclear death, and pounding the cities flat.\nThe emotions of those conscious---most of us were in a suspended state,\nso as not to age unnecessarily during the voyage---I can't imagine.\nBut Stenmark, and the Doc, and poor dead Rene' Christian, well, they\nhad to do something.\n\n'So they turned the ship about, and upon returning to Earth engaged\nin a high orbit around it, and tried to make contact, with anybody.  No\none there.  Even the orbiting agri-colonies and Moon bases hadn't\nbeen spared.  The latter might have been construed as some kind of\nmilitary threat, to the sick and paranoid, but to kill innocent\ncivilians, farmers for Christ's sake, just to be sure all was\nended.....  The worst you can think of us isn't bad enough, Kalus, if\nyou look at what we did to each other in the end.  Maybe we \u0091common\npeople' of the superpowers didn't take an active part in the\ndestruction; but we sure as hell sat on our asses, and let the\npresidents and the generals make it inevitable.' He subdued, or at\nleast restrained, his rising passion.\n\n'But that's neither here nor there.  Or anywhere, now.  That world\nis gone, and will never return.' He sighed bitterly.\n\n'Back on the ship, Christian lost her mind when she saw the\ndevastation, and knew that her husband and son were dead, like all the\nothers.  She couldn't live without them, and so she killed herself.\nThat left only Stenmark and Doc McIntyre to try and decide our fate.\nThe best they could do, under the circumstances, was to re-rig the\nentire ship---computer, cryogenics, life-support, everything---for a\nvastly different purpose than what they'd been designed for.  Their\nnew function was, simply, to hold us all in suspension, retain the high\norbit, and wake us all when, hopefully, it was safe to return to the\nsurface.\n\n'It's no coincidence that you, Sylviana, and William---you\nhaven't met him yet---came out of suspension at approximately the\nsame time we did.  A German scientist named Krause had been advocating a\ncommon de-suspension date, in the event such a travesty ever occurred.\nHe was considered a black pessimist at the time, and partly insane.  But\nyour father, and Sten, and possibly others, took his advice, and set the\n\u0091wake up call' for exactly ten thousand years from the first day\nof Armageddon, hoping that would give the planet enough time to heal\nitself, and support recognizable life-forms once more.\n\n'So the rest of the crew, myself included, came back from our little\nnap to find our world ravaged, Christian dead, and the Commander aged\ntwenty-five years.  The poor compassionate bastard had kept himself\nconscious all that extra time, making sure the orbit wouldn't decay,\nthat the converted solar panels and other adjustments he'd made would\nhold up.  Probably would have died for us if he thought it would\nhelp.....\n\n'You've seen the worst in us, Kalus.  But that damn Swede over\nthere . .is the best.  And a lot of others like him paid the same price\nas the political cowboys, and blind hedonists who elected them.  Death.\n\n'So.  That's the long and short of it.  We dealt with our feelings\nand our fears as best we could, and landed here, for a variety of\nreasons, just over a year ago.  We found William underground, and\napparently you found us.  So maybe our efforts aren't entirely\nfutile.  And who's to say, there may be others scattered around the\nplanet, each feeling as isolated and cut off as we do.'\n\nHe concluded as frankly as he had begun.  'But now I'm heartily\nsick of standing here and telling you our troubles, and I should hope\nyou're as tired of hearing them.  Apologies to the meek, and you see\nthe kind of \u0091Earth' you've inherited.  We'll let the\ncustomary interval of moody silence pass, and then we'll begin our\nscientific questioning.' With that he moved off and sat on the hard\nground, leaving the raw taste of truth, accepted willingly or not, in\nthe mouths of those around him.\n\nJust as he had said, an interval of silence ensued.  Then, to the\nsurprise of all, Kalus rose without prodding and moved to stand before\nthem.\n\n'This will not be easy for me,' he said.  'But I begin to see\nthat it is important, if only for myself.  I feared at first that you\nwould think me a mindless animal.  But I see now that isn't true.\nKataya told me not to be ashamed of what I am, and inside, in the heart\nof me, I'm not.  I am proud.  Because I survived for twenty-two years\na world that would kill most of you in a week.  That is not said to hurt\nyou, and I begin to see that you are strong in other ways.  It is only\nthe truth.  Here on the Island there is shelter from predators---there\nare no giant spiders or lizards---and you have the knowledge to bring\nfood from the land without killing.  My people have none of these\nthings.\n\n'We call ourselves the hill-tribe.  Yes we, Sylviana, I will not\nrenounce them.' She started to glare at him, then colored when she\nsaw others (including Kataya) watching her, and looked away.\n\n'We live in a cave of many entrances, in the heart of the Wild, with\nenemies all around us.  We survive by being shrewd and fiercely\ndetermined, and by showing any creature that comes too close there is a\nhigh price to pay for thinking us weak and afraid.\n\n'But we are not cruel, if we can avoid it, and do not kill without\nneed.  If there was some way we could live in peace and well-fed\ncontentment, we would throw away our spears and never kill again.  But\nno one has ever shown us how to do this, if such a way exists.'\n\nA gleam came into his eyes such as Sylviana had not seen for many\nmonths: when he first looked out from the smaller cave, and beheld the\npower and majesty of the Mantis.  'Go ahead,' he told them, almost\ndefiantly.  'Ask me any question.  Thank you Kataya, and David\nRawlings. You have made me feel strong and unashamed.'\n\nAt this there was another brief space in which the company felt\nreluctant to speak.  But it did not last.  Their desire to know, and to\ntouch new life, was stronger than their natural timidity.\n\n'Yes, I have a question,' said a woman.  'You say that your\npeople have no spoken language.' (Sylviana had told the doctor, who\nin turn had passed it on to the others).  'And yet you have a name.\nHow is that?'\n\n'My people all have names, but no sounds to go with them.  My name is\na sign made with the hands, or a figure drawn in the dirt, so that I can\nbe identified to others at need, such as during a hunt.  The Machine\ncalled me Kalus, to my mind as well as my ears, just as it gave names to\nall the elements of my world. I have always wondered how this was\ndone.'\n\nBrushing over this last information, which none understood and which\nthey could always come back to, they asked several more questions about\nthe hill-people, until one of the younger men produced a greaseboard and\nmarker, and approached him.\n\n'Your sign, the one that identifies you.  Could you draw it?'\nKalus took the board, and after being shown how to use it, drew a\nstraight line, horizontal, then a long curving tooth like a saber at the\nend of it, pointing downward.\n\n'This represents the upper jaw of the hill-cat, one of the greatest\nhunters of our world.  My first father made it for me, hoping that I\nwould be as fierce and cunning.  All our names our similar.  When he was\nkilled by a bear. . .I drew it in anger on the ground, then with my foot\nblurred away the sharp point, to show that I was no great predator, but\nonly a man.  Like this.' He smeared the lower half of the tusk,\nleaving only a squarish root.  'That has been my mark ever since.'\n\n'The MANtooth,' said Sylviana suddenly, and much to her own\nconsternation.  But half embarrassed, half proud in spite of herself,\nshe pushed on.  'The Machine called you the Mantooth.'\n\n'Yes,' he said simply.  'And that is what I am.'\n\n'This machine---' began another.\n\n'No, no, we'll come back to that later,' said Rawlings.\n'Your \u0091first father', Kalus.  What did you mean by that?'\n\n'Barabbas is my father now.  I think it is what you would call\nadoption, though to us it is much more than that.  The adopted sons of a\nchildless leader are more dear to him.....' He stopped as emotion\nswelled in his throat, and he realized with a sudden pang the truth of\nthese words.  'Barabbas is my father now.'\n\n'Barabbas,' replied Rawlings thoughtfully.  'Surely that's\nnot a name given by a machine.'\n\n'Yes.  In fact it is.  But I too have always thought it strange, and\nsomehow appropriate, since I learned of the Barabbas in your Bible.'\n\n'It's not MY Bible,' said Rawlings quickly.  'But still, how\ndo you mean that?' Kalus pondered for a moment, trying to think how\nto express it.\n\n'It wasn't Barabbas' fault: that he was freed, and Jesus\ncrucified.  He was only trying to survive.  And who can say what his\n\u0091crime' was that he should have been imprisoned by the Romans, who\nseem to me among the greatest criminals of history.  And yet for the\nsimple fact of his presence on that day, and his desire to live rather\nthan die in agony, he is branded a villain and hated, by those who need\nsuch symbols of hate, and love.  Surely Jesus did not hate him.'\n\nAt this all were quietly stunned.  For until that moment they had\nretained the subconscious arrogance that Sylviana first experienced, and\nto which she had lately returned: the belief that a rough man without\neducation could not think or feel as they did, could not possess the\nsame soul, or depth of feeling.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\n'Well said,' came a voice.  And for the rest of the afternoon the\nquestions were not asked as from adult to child, from superior beings to\ninferior, but as from man (and woman) to man.  Sylviana could only watch\nand listen, and tell herself in vain she didn't love him.\n\nBecause she had been stung by the affection he showed Kataya, and\nrefused to admit she was afraid of losing him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 41\n\n\nThe next morning Kalus was woken by Kataya, who came to the secluded\nclear space where he had made his bed on softer ground, with the\nsleeping bag that Rawlings had given him.  In the first light and waking\nlife of morning she was beautiful, and sad, and it was only with an\neffort that he reminded himself he was not free, to take her then and\nthere, and make love among the sacred rites of Spring.  But she showed\nno such inclination, saying only.\n\n'The Children will go North today, if Ishmael speaks the truth.  I\nwant to say goodbye, and I want you to be there with me.'\n\nHer tone was passive, and yet deeply serious.  He couldn't fully\nunderstand the reason, but consented, giving to her, unquestioningly,\nthe next hours of his life---giving as only the innocent can, without\nexacting a price, or expecting anything in return.\n\nThey walked together through the jumble of wounded landscape, now\ngrowing less stark with the blooming of flowers and the spreading of new\nleaves.  She seemed to know the way by heart, and he followed her with\nevery confidence.  They spoke little, but there seemed no need of talk\nbetween them, and Kalus felt no awkwardness.\n\nAt length the sounds of the sea became closer, and they emerged from the\ncrumpled hills to stand at the high back reaches of the inlet, the\nfjord.  It was not great, knifing inland for less than a mile, and\nscarcely sixty yards wide as it met the open sea.  Yet still it formed a\nseparate world, and spoke of green, unspoiled lands beyond.\n\n>From their rocky overlook they began to descend along an angular path\n that skirted its northern face.  They moved carefully and quietly, as\n the waterline grew nearer, and the sounds of the Sea more pervasive.\n Turning a last, difficult bend, they saw the Children among the rocks\n and moss-covered earth of the uneven slope ahead of them, the margins\n of their amphibious, Winter home.\n\nAs the man and woman continued to advance, a cry of 'Ay, oy!' was\nheard, and the younger members leapt into the water, as the whales\nclustered about the lower stones, waiting.\n\nBut one of the older males, in particular, showed no fear, and no sign\nof retreating.  Kataya he knew, and trusted, and the strong man with the\nsheathed weapon he had seen, in the boat, far away.  Also, as Kataya had\nintended, he felt something akin to jealousy at his presence here with\nher.  There was the matter of possession.\n\nThis was Ishmael, so named by Kataya---the second leader, who would be\nfirst when the eldest died.  He stood his ground in silence, along with\nthe leader, and slowly the others returned, though maintaining their\ndistance, and keeping close to the water's edge.\n\nKataya asked Kalus to remain where he was, and walked the numbered\nstrides that took her to the fourteen year old Ishmael.  He smiled as\nshe approached, and together they stood on the tiny patch of level\nground between them.  She brought an open hand to her chest, as she had\ndone with Kalus, then opened it toward him in greeting.  He did the\nsame, taking childlike pleasure in the understanding of her ways.\n\n'Izmai,' she said softly, pointing to the North.  'You go?'\nThen remembering that she had affixed no time, she added.  'This day,\nNorth?'\n\n'Izmai go,' he said proudly.  Then his look became one of eager\nentreaty, touching in its innocence.  'You go, Kai-tai, Noth?' And\nhis arm followed hers in obvious longing, a sweeping arc that to his\nmind held images of bergs and floes and sweeping tundra, and vast\nislands of thirty thousand seals: the cold, exhilarating perfection of\nunspoiled Arctic Seas.\n\nShe looked down, as pain clouded her face.  How could she tell him, who\nin naive trust believed that she could follow wherever he led?\n\n'No, I cannot.' But this word she had not taught him, and he would\nnot have understood.  She looked up into the huge, puzzled iris of his\neyes---blue, crater lakes that drowned all efforts to reach him.\nWeakly, the more pitiable because it came from one so strong, she said.\n'You come, in Winter, this place?'\n\nBut he could not get past the non-answer to his own question.  Knowing\nno other course, he repeated it.  'You come, Kai-tai, Noth?' She\nshook her head, and there was nothing more she could do or say.  He\nlooked hurt, but could not bridge the distance between them.\n\nAt this the unnamed Eldest, a supple, wizened hunter of fifteen, grew\nimpatient.  This day they must begin the long migration, and it was time\nto be gone.  He raised a bony left hand to his mouth and emitted a\nwhistling, clicking sound that was more of the deep than the land, and\nwhich the whales understood as well as he.\n\nIshmael turned to face her one more time, his own pain not lasting.\nComing closer, he touched her with the tip of his penis, indicating\npossession.  Then he slowly turned away, and followed the others into\nthe water.  Their restless mounts surged beneath them, and soon they\nwere drifting out of sight.\n\nKataya stood motionless, as if frozen by a curse, until she felt\nKalus' warm hands upon her shoulders.  She brushed him aside angrily,\npulling forward. But this time he did not relent, listening to his\ninstincts instead.  He grasped her by the arms and turned her towards\nhim, holding her firmly as she struggled.\n\n'Cry,' he said.  'Just cry.'\n\nFor a moment her face showed bitter conflict, but she could deny herself\nno longer.  She leaned against his chest, sobbing in the uncomprehending\ngrief of one who has spared herself nothing, yet come to no reward.  He\nstroked her hair gently, much as he had seen the doctor do with\nSylviana.  And though the two women were worlds apart in experience, and\nseemed so cold to one another, in this singular female emotion of love\nand loss, they were much the same.\n\n'He'll be dead in two years,' she said finally, not leaving the\nshelter of his body.  'He wants me, and I would dearly love to bear\nhis child.....  If we could only mix our blood with theirs, through\ninterbreeding, maybe we could end the tragedy of sure death in\nadolescence.\n\n'But they will only mate in the North,' she continued, stepping\nback and clearing her eyes with the back of her wrist.  'How.....\nHow can I reach him?' She could only repeat herself, an echo of\ntragedy.  'He'll be dead in two years.' Both turned and looked\nout to sea, to the place where whale and rider moved, nearly out of\nsight.\n\n'Goodbye,' she said darkly.  'Always goodbye.'\n\n'You need never say goodbye to me,' Kalus answered, almost before\nhe knew what he had said.  He shook his head reproachfully.  'I'm\nsorry.'\n\nShe was neither hurt nor angry with him, nor even soothed and pacified.\nShe seemed, rather, calm with a strange, fatalistic indifference.  Her\neyes regarded him, slightly mocking.\n\n'I know what you mean, Kalus.  You love Sylviana, but feel a sense of\nloyalty to me.  I guess it's better than nothing.' And with this\nshe mastered her emotions.  Or so it seemed to her then.\n\nKalus' mind began to race along strange passageways, trying to find\nthe right words.  But again instinct warned him off. He wanted to heal\nher hidden wounds but could not, and perhaps should not try, until he\nbetter understood them.  Though unknown feelings were at work inside\nhim, too.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThey returned to the camp in silence, not touching, not sharing, and if\nthey had dared to admit it, feeling more alone than if each to the other\ndid not exist.  They returned to Sylviana's glaring reproach, and to\nthe doctor's knowing questions about the Children, the others having\ngone off to work.  For he was the one member of the company to whom\nKataya would open her thoughts; and he, too, shared her desire to\nunderstand and cure the baffling self-destruction of the Children's\nbodies as they neared adulthood, never forgetting that a living soul was\ncarried within.\n\nAnd as always among the social intercourse of men, many actions and\nwords held cross-purposes at once, some realized, others forming like\nvague bubbles in the dark depths of the sea of human consciousness.\nSome would rise visibly, for those who knew how to read them; others\nwould be raised only in the seclusion of after-thought.  And still\nothers, unwisely, would be suppressed.  For all, in the end, must rise.\n\n'Have they gone?' asked McIntyre, needing only Kataya's\ndesolate expression for an answer.\n\n'We'll get \u0091em next year,' he said more quietly.\n\n'Who?  What do you mean?' asked Sylviana.\n\n'The Children,' he answered.  'Every Spring they migrate\nnorth.' He observed the tension between herself and Kalus, and added.\n'You've wondered, no doubt, why the killer whales took up with\nthem in the first place?'\n\n'Yes,' said Kalus.  'Why?'\n\n'Intelligent symbiosis, my friend.  Works every time.  A hunter like\nyourself will no doubt appreciate their technique.  The youngsters make\nland some distance from the beaches where the seals lie in their\nhundreds, then come up behind them with sticks, startling them and\ndriving them into the sea, where the orcas are waiting.  Then the\nChildren kill a few themselves, on land, and eat them on the spot.\nFeeds \u0091em both, neat as neat.  A lesson for us all, I dare say.'\nHe exchanged a look with Kataya, who said nothing.\n\n'But they'll return next year?' asked Sylviana, still moved by\nthe memory of them, though compassion was receding before the onslaught\nof jealous anger.\n\n'Or move on to another island,' said Kataya coldly, unable to mask\nher dislike.\n\n'Oh, they'll be back,' assured the doctor, 'As soon as\nIshmael takes over.  Only a fool leaves a beautiful princess trapped in\nthe tower forever.' He looked at Kalus as he said this, though only\nSylviana seemed to take his meaning, flushing with confusion and\nresentment.\n\nThough neither of the newcomers could know it, the remark was neither\nlight nor haphazard.  The doctor was testing the waters for a\nprocreation problem which struck much closer to home.  And though lost\nin the swirl of double meanings, Kalus realized nonetheless that despite\nincluding several couples (he had no word for \u0091married'), there\nwere no children among company.  He looked first to Kataya, whose\nexpression in return was almost angry, then to McIntyre, who nodded\ngently.  Sylviana would not even look at him.\n\n'Hell, kids,' said the doctor at length, 'I might as well just\ntell you.' He set down the potted plants he was working on (from\nwhich he hoped to make new medicines), and pulled an end chair toward\nthem.  Then seating himself like an ancient storyteller, he bade Kalus\nand Sylviana to sit at his feet.  To this only Kalus consented, the two\nwomen still exchanging poison glances.  But if this was the audience to\nwhich he must speak, then speak he would, torn as his own feelings were\nby the animosity of the two young women, secretly heartened as he\nrealized that Kataya's scorn must be the result of physical stirrings\nfor Kalus---as strong and healthy a sire as he could wish.\n\n'Of the seven male crew members of the Virgo, four came out of\nsuspension sterile.' At this blunt beginning Sylviana gasped, sensing\nperhaps what was to come.\n\n'Yes,' resumed McIntyre.  'Of the three still capable of\nproducing living sperm. . .myself not included,' he added somewhat\nwistfully, 'None are married, or even much attached to a woman still\nin healthy child-bearing years.  They can't father a child,' he\nexplained for Kalus' benefit.  'An unforeseen side-effect of so\nlong a period of physiological inactivity.  We have no children, as\nI'm sure you've noticed, and unless we can overcome our natural\ntimidity and social taboos, we never will.'\n\nHe looked again toward the lovely Oriental, trying to gauge what should\nand should not be said.  But lost in her own bitterness, she could give\nhim no sign.  So he sighed, and said simply.\n\n'Kataya and I had hoped that perhaps Ishmael.....  But he's gone\nnow, and who knows if we'll ever see him again, or even if his\nchromosomes would match.'\n\n'Ishmael will come back,' answered Kalus seriously, the\ndoctor's words largely lost on him, but wanting to ease Kataya's\npain.  'Once a man has touched his own soul through another, there is\nnothing else in life that matters.' And not understanding the effect\nthat this would have, he looked not at Sylviana, of whom he was\nspeaking, but to Kataya, by way of explanation and reassurance.\n\nAt this Sylviana let out a wordless execration, threw down the sheet she\nwas mending, and stormed off .  Kalus followed in sudden fear.\n\n'I did not mean---' he said desperately, but found her door\nslammed and bolted in his face.  In confusion he returned to the doctor,\nimploring.\n\n'What do I have to do?' he said in frustration.  'Can't she\nsee that there could never be anyone else for me?  Why can't she\nunderstand?'\n\n'Give her time, my friend,' said McIntyre.  'She'll come\naround.  If you want my observations, you're in her deep, and that\nfrightens her.  Just have a little patience, and if a man of science may\nsay it, a little faith. What's meant to be, will always be in the\nend.' These words seemed wise, yet Kalus could find no comfort in\nthem.\n\n'But my stomach crawls without her.  My heart is in my throat, and I\ncannot sleep.  If I lose her there will be nothing.  Nothing at all.'\n\n'You haven't lost her, son.' With this he looked ruefully\ntoward Kataya.  'And if I'm any judge, you won't.  Just be\nsteady, with open arms, and she'll come back to you in time.'\n\nBut as McIntyre continued to study the younger man, he saw that his\nexpression remained deeply troubled, so much so that he was truly\ntouched, as Kalus had been at the simple confusion of Ishmael.\n\n'If it helps, I'll tell her what you meant just now.  Kataya and I\nunderstood.  She's just too close, and can't see it.'\n\n'Would you really do that?'\n\n'Of course.'\n\n'Thank you,' said Kalus, though his fear was not abated.  'I\nhave to go somewhere and think.'\n\nBewildered and restless, Kalus called to the cub, and went walking off\nin no particular direction, perhaps heading vaguely toward the solace of\nthe sea.\n\nHe tried to tell himself that things would work out---that he would one\nday understand and be more comfortable among the baffling maze of human\ninteraction.  But it was no use.  What was he doing here, surrounded by\npeople and emotions he could not begin to read?  Is this what Sylviana\nhad wanted?\n\nHe found himself thinking, with sudden longing, of the world and way of\nlife he had known in the Valley.  He thought of his brother, who had\ntaken a mate, and wondered if she was yet with child.  Perhaps it would\nbe a boy, like Shama, who would not mistrust him, but look up to him in\nfriendship.  He thought of the wolves, now led by Akar, his noble\nfriend.  Surely he did not mean for them to keep Alaska forever sundered\nfrom the pack, or from himself, who would need a mate.  And last, though\nfar from least he thought of Avatar, who would always be free.  And for\na time his spirit ran with him, through the heart of a forest five\nhundred miles deep.\n\nWas a compromise of worlds possible, he wondered, some meaningful\ncoexistence between the hill-people and the colonists?  He tried, but\ncould not imagine it.  And what did it matter, if he lost the only woman\nhe would ever love?  Again he felt the sudden, sour turning of his\nstomach, and the debilitating flow of unused adrenalin.\n\nHe wanted just to go to her, and take her to him, and tell her he was\nhers alone, and always.  He felt the longing for her touch like a hole\nin his chest.  But what could he do, when she would not let him near\nher?  He had not been alone with her for two days, which seemed an\neternity, and she showed no sign.....  Anger and jealousy hardly seemed\nthe signs of love.\n\nHe could not work it out, and was soon too weary and sick at heart to\ncare much, even for something that touched him so deeply.  There was no\nunderstanding the minds of women, he conceded in despair.  Or of men.\n\nHe could only be what he was, and hope this self-honesty would bring him\nto his proper place in the end.\n\nAND IF IT DIDN'T?\n\nComing out of the ragged confusion of earth and stone onto a tranquil\nstretch of beach, he stripped off his outer garments and began to wade\nout into the waves, stooping to wash away both grime and fatigue.  The\nwater was not warm, and perhaps there were lurking dangers---\n\n'I don't care!' he cried in answer, the torrent of his anger\nreturning with sudden force.  He dove and swam out into deeper waters,\nwhile the cub remained on shore and barked at him.\n\nSlowly, fighting the undertow, he made his way back to solid ground.  OR\nAS SOLID AS I'M LIKELY TO FIND, he thought bitterly.  Emerging truly\nexhausted, he fell to his knees, then sorrowfully held and reassured his\nunspeaking friend.\n\nHe lay down in the sand like an animal.  And slept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 42\n\n\nThat night, wrapped in the tragicomedy of human pride and affection,\nnone of the three found peace.\n\nFor Sylviana the evening seemed endless, trying to drag conversation\nfrom the tired and otherwise absorbed company.  And when hard night fell\nat last she found she could not sleep.  Instead she restlessly mulled\nover the \u0091situation' with Kalus, as she called it: the doctor's\nexplanation for his actions, and his relayed message that, 'There\ncould never be anyone else.'\n\nBut this only made her angry with herself for having been so obvious in\nfront of the others.  What did it matter to her what he said or did?  He\nhad given her her \u0091freedom', and seemed intent on exercising his\nown, no matter what his words might say.  So she tried again to make\nherself interested in the young botanist, Smith, who had already asked\nher a number of leading questions, under the pretense (she assumed) of\nscientific inquiry.\n\nBut the bed was still empty, and her thoughts still vague and rootless,\nwithout Kalus there beside her.  She felt again the primal urge to go to\nhim, just go to him, and renew their bond through physical love.  But\nremembering the pain of her last submission to it, she stubbornly\nrefused.  Or tried to.  Until it was too late.\n\nKalus lay on his back on the ground, the sleeping bag giving him warmth,\nbut little else.  He put his hands behind his head and looked to the\nsky, while the cub nestled at his feet.\n\nHow far away the stars looked, how indifferent and utterly unreachable.\nThinking yet again of his love, he felt the loneliness and broken\nlonging that every unfulfilled man must know: that of useless labors,\nand barren seed.  The worry-sickness of caring for one who no longer\nreturned that love, had slowly eaten away at the warmth and loyalty he\nfelt for her, leaving him hard and cold and indifferent.  Or so it\nseemed to him then.  He rolled over onto his side, muttering, and\nperhaps an hour later fell at last into a restless, brooding sleep.\n\nBut Kataya could no more sleep than bring back the dead, stung to the\nvery heart by intolerable memories of the love she had lost forever.\nAnd this pain which lay at the heart of all others, aggravated that very\nday by the departure of Ishmael and the poor, doomed Children, tormented\nher every thought, until even the simplest feeling could not be\naccomplished without a pain that was almost physical.\n\nAnd while she considered herself superior to Sylviana, and even in a way\nto Kalus himself, the lashings of emptiness at the hollow discipline of\ndenial were no less acute for it.  She remembered the words of Sinclair\nLewis, from the book she was then translating.\n\n'Not individuals but institutions are the enemies, And THEY MOST\nAFFLICT THE DISCIPLES WHO MOST GENEROUSLY SERVE THEM.' A more apt\ndescription of her own religious and cultural servitude she could not\nimagine.\n\nBut these self-recriminations were meaningless, and she knew it.  What\nlay at the root of her agitation was her forlorn desire for Kalus.\nBeyond the strong and undeniable physical attraction, his innocence,\nlike Ishmael's, of the brutal travesty which had killed both her\nhusband and the unborn child she carried unknowingly onto the Virgo.....\n\n'Enough!  Leave me alone!'\n\nBut there was no escaping herself.  Tragedy, desire, and longing for a\nnew life that she could truly call her own, all drew her toward him as\nirresistibly as childbirth.  Added to this was the knowledge, confirmed\nby the vaginal thermometer, that this night, this very hour, her body\nwas as ready to conceive as it had ever been since the long sleep, as it\nmight ever be again.  All her pain and frustration now focused upon this\nsingular and uncorrupted man as a well-spring of life and relief, pure\nwater to one dying of thirst.  If he rejected her, the agony and shame\nwould be unbearable.  But dear, sweet holy Buddha, how could any pain be\nworse than this?\n\nIt was not greater wisdom that sent her to him in the end, but an\nagitation of sorrow and loneliness that were longer, and more\ninescapable.  While Sylviana forced herself to stay, Kataya shed a\nsingle, honest tear, and surrendered.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus stirred, feeling silken fingers touch his breast, bare legs\nagainst his own.  He let out a despairing sigh as soft lips caressed\nhim---his mouth, his neck, his chest---all in deepest passion, and\nsolemn entreaty.\n\nIt was not his true love, but he could not deny her this.  Nor, as he\nheld her close, did he have any wish to, all else falling away in the\nunconscious amnesia of male passion.  He threw open the sleeping bag,\nlongingly kissed her cheek, her neck, the lovely space above her\nbreasts.\n\n'Kataya,' he whispered passionately, and there was nothing else in\nhis world, no other salve for the endless pain and frustration.  There\nwas only her, here and now, her face wet with tears, vulnerable,\ncompelling.  He released the knotted loincloth, as their most sensitive\nreaches drew nearer.  Her breasts rubbed gently across his.  Then he\nslid down, yielding to that most primal longing: to suckle at the\nbreast, fountain of all life.\n\n'Yes,' she whispered fervently.  'Yes, Kalus.  TAKE me.' He\nraised himself on his arms, opening her legs with his own, and with the\nsighing aid of her hand, was inside her.  He did not love her, but he\nlonged for her, making the physical release and abandon perhaps the\ngreater for it.  He was not gentle, nor did she ask him to be.  For in\nthat moment she was not a woman, but all women, and his anger would not\nbe abated.\n\nBut as he approached climax, too soon, his gentler nature returned, and\nhe not only remembered, but yearned for the soul inside her. She felt\nhim withdraw.  And though she experienced a moment of bitter\ndisappointment, that all was yet in vain, he only moved to kneel over\nher, kissing her lips, her eyes, her neck and then her breasts.  And all\nthe while his right hand encircled her deepest temple, caressing,\nkneading, softly stroking and then penetrating its moist readiness.  In\nrapture she threw back her head, breathed deeply and surrendered to\norgasm.  Then gently, now quieter, he put himself inside her once more,\nmoving his penis in slow, beautiful patterns that she thought would\nbreak her heart with loving pleasure.  And in time as his own breathing\nbecame deeper, and his thrusts more urgent, she felt the throbbing\nwetness come again, as together they forgot all else in the throes of\nthat blessed, animal release.  Plaintive, moaning sounds split the\nnight.\n\nThen he reached back and covered them both with the sweetly softened\nsleeping bag, inside her still, their limbs intertwined, breath\ncommingling.\n\n'Thank you,' she whispered, taking his head in her hands and\nkissing him with all her heart and soul, as she felt his strong arms\nengulf her and his lips caress her with spoken and unspoken words of\naffection and reassurance.  And soon, very naturally, both drifted off\ninto a sleep no longer bitter, at glorious, indifferent peace with\nthemselves and with their world.\n\n\n*\n\n\nIn the chill hour before dawn, Sylviana woke from a horrible dream.\nSome hideous, ill-defined beast had sprung upon Kalus from a shadow, and\nwith teeth and claws and sheer weight pinned him to the ground, slashing\nand rending, tearing him apart.\n\nShe sat bolt upright in the silent gloom.  The room was empty, and the\ndream had been too real.  Forgetting all else she threw on a robe, left\nthe building and ran toward the place where she knew he lay sleeping.\nShe no longer cared for games, or being right.  She only wanted to be\nwith him.  To hold him and.....\n\nThere were sounds ahead of her in the darkness.  Two voices.  She\nslowed, and then moved off the path, taking cover behind a small tree.\nWhat she heard in its near seclusion seemed less real than the\nnightmare, and yet far more terrible.\n\n'I should go now,' said Kataya, rising and slipping the silk dress\nacross her arms and shoulders, then lowering it softly into place.\n\n'Yes.  I do not think Sylviana would understand.  But we understand,\ndon't we?  You know what this night was for us?'\n\n'Yes.  Just hold me, kiss me once, and then I'll go.'\n\n'Goodbye, my beautiful Kataya.'\n\n'My beautiful Kalus.' And with a tear that no longer wounded her,\nshe was gone.\n\nSylviana slithered to the ground with her back against the tree, her\nsorrow as bitter and unquenchable as any she had ever known.  Whatever\nher sins and follies may have been, she paid for them dearly in those\nmoments.  For she saw more clearly and painfully than ever, as much as\nif he had been killed, that she loved him beyond all others, almost\nbeyond her own life.  And she knew it as she felt him betray her, and\ngive the precious love that had been hers alone, to another woman.\n\nAnother woman!  How could he?  After all they had been through.....  How\ncould he think that she wouldn't come back to him, just because for a\ntime she had been uncertain.  Hadn't he driven her to it?\n\nThat perhaps it was she who had driven him, that he had given Kataya\nsomething beautiful and desperately needed, that she herself might give\nsuch a precious gift to a man like Stenmark, none of these thoughts\ncould occur.  Because like Kalus or Kataya (or anyone else), she was a\nproduct, and in some measure a victim, of the world in which she had\ngrown.  For she had been taught (though not by her father) that this was\nthe one, all-consuming act of a man's betrayal, and a thing which\ncould never be forgiven.  And like Barabbas in his rage of righteous\nanger, she too cast him out, out of her heart forever.\n\nOn a more human level, and in a flood of final tears, like the little\ngirl bereft of her mother she felt devastated and lost, and swore that\nshe would never again let anyone come so close, and hurt her so badly.\nShe stood up again, desperate and proud and defiant, ready to go on\nwithout him.\n\nBut she had forgotten his wilderness senses.  He had heard her crying\nbefore Kataya was out of sight, and realized with crushing finality and\nself-reproach how much she loved him, and how deeply he had wounded her.\nHe stood now just a few feet away, and committed his second great\nmistake of human psychology.\n\nBecause whatever rash promises she might have made to herself in the\n        depths of rejection and spiritual agony, so long as they\n        remained within her they might still have softened with time,\n        leaving the heart open to forgiveness and return.  But by\n        confronting her then and allowing the volcano to erupt, spewing\n        forth its rage upon him, the hateful words solidified and became\n        a reality unto themselves, a spoken curse that foolish, endless\n        human pride would then have to live up to.  He stood before her,\n        pale and shivering, neither explaining nor begging forgiveness.\n        His simple heart would only say.  'I have never loved anyone\n        else.  I never could.  This was not love, in the way that you\n        and I---' Her open hand struck across his face with the fury\n        of all women scorned.  'I hate you!' she cried\n        hysterically.  'We're finished, FOREVER!  And I'll HURT\n        you before I'm through.  Just wait and see how I hurt\n        you!' And she stormed away, her love and pain alike submerged\n        beneath the weight of hard words, and harder justice.  Because\n        male pride is evil enough, in its blunt and stupid way\n        destroying much that is gentle and fair.  But a woman's\n        vengeance, turned devious by the depths of her vulnerability,\n        and the intricate contradiction of her emotions.....  True Hell\n        would be raised, one way or the other.  Kalus watched her go,\n        and though shocked and stunned and hurt himself, felt yet again\n        the indestructible bond that was his love for her.  When she\n        struck him it had been as if he struck himself, and even as she\n        promised to hurt him, his one thought was for her safety.\n        Kataya, Komai, even the cub who stood beside him, became\n        secondary, superfluous in his life.  She was his woman, his\n        family, and in everything but name, his wife.  And whatever she\n        might do or say, he would never leave her.  But as the cub\n        gently nuzzled against his leg, seeking some sign of\n        reassurance, he was dismayed to find large tears running down\n        his face, as in his mind's eye he saw Barabbas with the other\n        males huddled silently behind him, telling him to go.\n        'Why?' he asked aloud, his burning eyes turned toward the\n        heavens.  'Why must I always be punished for showing mercy,\n        and trying to do what is right?' But it was not mercy he felt\n        when he took Kataya to him, and he knew it.  He kicked at a\n        protruding root, but trying to make his anger flare was like\n        trying to make a fire of damp wood.  Guilt and remorse quickly\n        smothered it, smothered him.  He stroked Alaska's head and\n        said quietly, 'It's all right.' But he neither felt it,\n        nor believed it himself.  That afternoon William appeared, like\n        the white shadow of a tenement grave, and Sylviana had found her\n        instrument of revenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 43\n\n\nAll that morning Kalus stayed away, not wanting Sylviana to see him, not\nwanting to destroy for Kataya what they had shared the night before.\nThe gesture was not entirely noble: now more than ever he found it\nimpossible to think or plan, and simply did not know what else to do.\n\nBut as various members of the company began to return early from their\nlabors, as if by mutual consent at the fine Spring weather, the amiable\nSmith accosted him in the place where he sat brooding.  The youngest of\nthe company, he had a pleasant, almost boyish face, with sandy hair and\na light moustache.  He took Kalus up as if they were old friends, and\ninsisted they share a bottle of wine to celebrate the day.  Kalus hardly\nfelt like celebrating, and was half fearful of the liquor's effect on\nhim; but the other's friendly oblivion made it all but impossible to\nsay no.  So at last, wearily, he consented.\n\nThe two went briefly to the botanist's rooms to fetch it, then turned\nthemselves again out of doors.  There in the clear space by the tables\nKalus saw the two women: Kataya, who looked up from her work and smiled\nfaintly, and Sylviana, who did not smile, though she could not entirely\nhide her relief at seeing him at all.  But the embers of her anger still\nsmoldered, waiting only for a restless wind to stoke them again to\nwithering fire.\n\nThe two men moved to the crest of the hill which formed one border of\nthe grassy bowl in which the others had gathered, and sat beneath the\nspeckled shade of a young tree that grew there.  From here they could\nsurvey the company without feeling too close, and therefore inhibited.\nSmith opened the bottle, and after taking several large gulps (despite\nthe assumed bravado he was nervous, and uncertain how to proceed) passed\nit to Kalus, who was much more cautious.\n\nIn time he felt the liquor, though he was not overwhelmed by it.  Yet he\nspoke little, gazing wistfully into the small valley at the two women he\nhad loved: desiring again the one, though he rebuked himself for it,\nloving, and at the same time hating, the fallen angel of his heart.\nSmith observed this, and failing in his attempts at indirect\nconversation, spoke more plainly.\n\n'I guess by now the Doc has explained to you something of our\nbreeding problem.....  Dave Rawlings can be a bit blunt---subtle as a\ntruck, really---but he generally says the things that need to be said.\nAbout mating, for example, and children.' Kalus turned toward him\ncuriously, as Smith pretended not to notice.\n\n'He and I were just talking about it last night, and do you know what\nhe said?  \u0091Stop screwing around and just ask them.  Enough of this\ntimidity.  It's high time for those of us who can still procreate to\nget down to some serious fucking.''\n\nIf Smith had stopped talking long enough, Kalus would have gotten up and\nwalked away from what seemed to him a lunatic assault on those things he\nheld most dear.  But he did not stop.\n\n'We've all been in rather a state of shock the past year, sexually\nas well as otherwise.  And of course we had plenty of other things to\nthink about first: constructing the shelters, laying up food for the\nWinter.'\n\n'Survival,' said Kalus bluntly.  'Just like everyone else.'\n\n'Yes.....  Are you angry with me?'\n\nThe man-child studied the face of the other, finding nothing but\nfriendship, sensitivity and good intentions.  'No,' he said sadly.\n'I don't know what to feel.'\n\n'Should we talk about this another time?'\n\n'What would it change?'\n\n'Probably nothing,' said Smith ruefully.  'You understand that\nI'm only speaking for the good of the group.  We're a family,\nreally.'\n\n'But one without children,' added Kalus sympathetically.\n\n'Yes.  We need them. . .or everything we do dies with us.  Along with\nall hope for the future.' He took another drink to keep from\nbetraying emotion.  But this only augmented, rather than submerging the\nyearning for life that so overwhelmed him.  'The sound of their\nlaughter,' he began again, his eyes welling.  The wail of newborn\nlife. . .would be such blessed relief from the dry, sterile sound of our\nown voices.'\n\nAt this Kalus eyes' misted as well, remembering Shama, and the Child\non the shore.  'I would give everything I have to hear it,' he\nsaid, surprised by his own words, and the thoughts that lay behind them.\n\n'Me, too.' And the young scientist put a hand on Kalus'\nshoulder.  'What I'm trying to tell you is that according to our\ntests, only Rawlings, myself and the Commander, still have the ability\nto father a child.  And in your case, of course, there would be no\nreason for the sterility.' At Kalus' questioning look he added.\n'Oh, the others can still make love, it just doesn't get them\nanywhere.....  No pregnancy.  No kids.'\n\n'What are you asking me to do?'\n\nSmith sighed, knowing it was now or never.  'Look down there.  You\nsee that beautiful, slender reed in the black dress?'\n\n'Kataya.'\n\n'Yes.....  She's twenty-six, and in the full flower of womanhood.\nShe desperately wants a child, but apparently the rest of us don't do\nanything for her. And then Dr. Welles, there.' He\npointed. 'Thirty-four, and married to a man who can't give her\nchildren.  Should they both be punished for it?  And your own Sylviana.\nWouldn't the two of you, at least, consider having a child?'\n\nBut Kalus' mind was reeling.  The concept of free love was so\nincredible to him, at once both desirable and unthinkable.....  He gave\nvoice to only one of the myriad questions that confronted him.\n\n'Is there no other way?'\n\n'There's always artificial insemination: taking a man's sperm\nand a woman's egg and placing them together, either in the uterus, or\nin the laboratory.  But that's so cold and mechanical.  Also,\nwe're trying to stay a little closer to nature than our predecessors,\nhoping to avoid some of their mistakes.  And for me, at least,\nthere's a \u0091spiritual' side to it: which sperm cell is MEANT to\nfertilize which egg.  Can you see what I'm driving at?'\n\nKalus, who had understood very little, could only say.  'I have made\nlove to only two women in my life.  And I should have been more than\ncontent with the one, if she.....  Well if.....  I don't know if I\ncan help you,' he finished weakly.  But then, whether because of the\nalcohol, the other man's openness, or the sheer physical need to let\nit out, he told him.\n\n'I made love to Kataya last night.'\n\n'Good,' said Smith warmly.  'Good for you.'\n\n'Not good for me. . .or Sylviana.  She learned of it, and cast me\nout.' He lowered his face, bitter and ashamed.  'I feel as if\nI'm already dead.'\n\nSmith was quiet for a moment, allowing the other to gather himself, then\nsimply said what he thought.\n\n'You did nothing wrong, Kalus.  I see in you no more of the user and\nthe taker than I do in myself---probably the reason we've both slept\nwith so few women.  But as for Sylviana. . .maybe she won't\nunderstand.  But maybe, in time, she will.  Welles is probably giving\nher the same talk right now.'\n\nAt this Kalus looked down into the bowl once more, and saw to his relief\nand glimmering hope that Dr. Welles was in fact speaking seriously with\nSylviana, who blushed, looking down, then up at him uncertainly.\n\n'In the meantime,' Smith continued, 'Try not to isolate\nyourself so much.  Loneliness will kill you by itself.  Throw in\nalienation and remorse, and it's no wonder you feel the way you\ndo.' He looked the man-child straight in the eye, and said sincerely.\n\n'Be my friend, Kalus.  The rest of us aren't so bad.  But if you\nhave trouble being open with them, then start with me.  I'm not\nnearly as shallow and glib as I come across---a defense mechanism I\nguess, to keep myself from being hurt.  But I do care, and I'd be\nhonored.' And he gave Kalus his hand on it.\n\nKalus took it in his own, finding unexpected relief, as Sylviana watched\nhim, and listened to Dr. Welles, and felt her hard resolve begin to\nwaver.\n\nAnd all might still have been well, but for the sinister and unknown\ntiming of the Stranger, who at that moment descended the rise at a cold\ndistance from the two men, and seeing the strange and alluring new\nwoman, devoted to her all his questionable attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 44\n\n\nWilliam, who admitted to having no last name, was of slightly less than\naverage height, with dark hair, a rough complexion, and a certain\nquality of nondescriptness about his face and features.\n\nUntil one met the eyes.  These were at once both black and pierced with\nlight, aloof and penetrating, as if possessed of some underworld\nknowledge that rendered all waking truth both poignant and, in the end,\nutterly meaningless.  Once seen, though the rest of the face remained\ndifficult to recall, these darkened orbs were indelibly burned into\nmemory---fierce, desperate, and dying.  Restless, fearful, weary of the\ncrumbling bridge that so narrowly separates life from death.....\n\nHe had not always been this way.  Though his childhood had been tragic\nenough---abandoned shortly after birth, stored like some kind of\nhazardous waste in orphanages and foster homes, moving on as he became a\ntroubled adolescent (and who wouldn't be?) to jails and juvenile\ndetention centers---it had not killed him, and that at least was\nsomething.  He had run away (escaped) at the age of sixteen, and like so\nmany other lost souls without hope or guidance, had gravitated to New\nYork City to be tried by the relentless hell-fire of the streets.\n\nBut unlike most, he had survived.  Here, through various underground\nactivities, ranging from petty theft and burglary to trafficking\nnarcotics, he had somehow managed to keep body and soul together.  And\nno one seemed to take much notice of one more suspected junkie, living\nin abandoned buildings and selling small quantities of marijuana,\ncocaine, and whatever assorted pills he could buy, make, or steal from\ndockside warehouses.  He was left alone for the most part, and aside\nfrom the odd roughing up by the police, given tentative permission to\nexist.\n\nBut as he unknowingly turned the page on his twentieth year (for the\ndate of his birth was known to no one, and his childhood but a blur of\npain and abuse without names or numbers for reference), and as he found\nhis heart still beating, his lungs still demanding air, and the various\nhungers of life giving him no chance to cease his restless moving, a\nsmall miracle had occurred.  Someone noticed, and more than that, fell\nin love with him: a fifteen-year-old Chicano girl named Kathy.\n\nTheir meeting was chance enough, and would have passed like so many\nothers, but for the small compassion that still lived in him.  Finding\nher tearful and alone on the front steps of a tenement, in which her\nalcoholic father had beaten and fondled her for perhaps the thirtieth\ntime, refraining from actual rape only because she screamed so loudly\nand the walls were thin, William sat down beside her, gave her his\nbandana to wipe the blood from her ear, and offered to take her to a\npublic health clinic that he knew.  When she declined as the result of a\nquestionable immigration status (and a desire not to return to the even\nmore brutal life of Guatemala City), he had given her an ounce of\nmarijuana, along with spoken directions to the condemned building in\nwhich he slept on the floor on a mattress of flattened cardboard boxes.\nIf she needed anything, he said, he would try to help.\n\nThe next day when he returned to check on her, he found that her father,\naided in his spiritual pilgrimage by a fifth of tequila, had fallen from\nthe fire escape, and was now in a City hospital pending deportation.\nThat was why she had not returned to their room, but remained on the\nfront steps, freed from one hell but confident that another awaited her,\nwhich no doubt it did: she had no money, and would soon be evicted.\n\nWilliam had bought her breakfast, stolen her a jacket and scarf, then\nbrought her to his mansion of rats, fallen plaster, moldering walls, and\nwarmed by a kerosene heater which only smoked dangerously toward\nmorning.\n\nAfter waiting for three days to be put to work on the streets, she found\nto her amazement that he neither demanded she sell herself to others or\nperform sex tricks for him, and had not put a hand on her except in\nawkward comfort and reassurance.  That night she gave herself to him,\nthey made sweet and tender love; and he had done something even more\ninexplicable.  He had cried, and promised to protect her with his life\nagainst the bitcheries of poverty and despair that he knew so well.\n\n>From that time on they were inseparable, living where they could, doing\n what they had to do, to survive.  William was not, in fact, a junkie,\n though he came as close to the line without crossing it as any human\n being ever could.  But for Kathy's sake he gave up hard drugs almost\n completely, finding that with her he no longer needed the barbiturates\n to sleep, injected amphetamines to feel alive in the night, or alcohol\n to keep the spiritual agony from killing him.  Without the world's\n help, or even its consent, he pulled himself and his young woman up out\n of the gutter, and as she had done for him, gave them both a reason to\n live.\n\nBut then Armageddon had come, oblivious to his, and everyone's,\nagonies and ecstasies, bitter triumphs and long defeats.  The War, that\nhad been building for centuries from Man's ignorance, and inability\nto overcome his instinct for violence, finally broke out.  The satellite\nlasers had protected the City for a time, keeping the first wave of\nmissiles off them, for perhaps an hour.  But it didn't take a genius\nto know that New York's famous minutes were numbered.\n\nSo through the crash of panic-stricken people, trying to evacuate or\nmerely crying, 'Oh, my God!' while still others who had not seen\nor heard the broadcasts stood about in a daze and tried to understand\nwhat was happening, William took Kathy and sought out his friend,\nDr. Wilhelm Krause---the black pessimist, partly insane.  Looting, too,\nhad broken out, but it was halfhearted, so that even the police, grim\nsoldiers of the street, showed little inclination toward retaliatory\nviolence.  The City, for all its noise and seeming activity, was in a\nstrangling state of shock.\n\nWilliam found Dr. Krause---whom he had met while hospitalized with\nhepatitis (from a rusted syringe)---in his basement laboratory, sunk\nninety feet below the ground, side-cut into solid bedrock at the base of\ngigantic Mercy Hospital.  For among the towering sky-scrapers, some\nreaching over two hundred stories, it was not uncommon for their\nfoundations to sink another tenth that distance.  And along with the\nsubways, bored farther and farther beneath the level of the streets,\nthey formed the literal New York underground, a silent world unto\nitself, a still, protected inlet in the heart of the maelstrom.\n\nWhen William burst in upon the aged Krause, the latter did not at first\nseem to recognize him.  For though he had been preparing for this day\nfor many years, now that it had come, his mind and heart were simply\noverwhelmed. He found himself unable to act, or even think.  It was\nreally happening, not in theory, not in the lecture hall, but in\ndamnable and undeniable reality.  The unspeakable, of which he had\nspoken for thirty years, had happened at last.  There was something he\nwas supposed to do.....\n\nSlowly his weary eyes and mind focused, his German courage rallied, and\nhe saw before him the young man he had once caught trying to steal\nmorphine from the hospital storeroom.  In a moment almost of nostalgia,\nhe recalled the incident.  He had not called security or the police, had\nnot tried to confront the sick and desperate youth, but said simply,\n'Go back to your room, son.  No, I'm not going to turn you in.\nWe'll talk about it later.' And to the young man's astonishment\nthey HAD talked, on several occasions and for hours at a time.  William\nfound in the aging and alienated recluse a friend, and the closest thing\nto a father that he would ever know.  When he had spoken of his life,\nKrause listened attentively, as if finding in the bitter tale of poverty\nand poor health, pursuit and persecution, a note in harmony with his own\nstruggle amidst the viper-filled pit of unenlightened human nature.\nUpon William's release he had shown him his laboratory, and explained\nwhat it was for.  And he had told him to come, if this moment ever\narrived.\n\n'Hello, William,' he said quietly.\n\n'Doctor!' said the other breathlessly.  'I don't care about\nmyself, but you HAVE to save Kathy.  She can't die, she just\ncan't!'\n\n'Now, now,' said Krause, 'There's no need to be heroic.  You\nsound like one of those detestable Wagnerian operas---all full of blood\noaths, and absurd quests to dubious ends.  Damned prelude to the Nazis\nis what they were, along with Nietzsche and all that, \u0091Great men\ncreate their own morality' horse-shit.  Did you know Hitler was\nimpotent?  That's why he never married Eva Braun.  They say that\nGoring used to wear eye make-up when they were alone, and---'\n\n'Doctor, please!'\n\n'Yes, yes, I know.  You're sure that at any moment the lights will\ngo out, we'll hear the rumble from above, and the chance will be\nlost.  You underestimate me, young man.  This laboratory will be intact,\nand protected from radiation, ten thousand years from now.  You forget\nthe lengths that a \u0091mad German' will go to.' But seeing\nWilliam's anguish, he said.  'Yes, we'll save Kathy.  And just\nfor the hell of it, why don't we save you, too?  Since I don't\nseem to have any other volunteers.'\n\nWilliam looked around him, then at the two elaborate suspension casks,\nthe best and most advanced in the world---made by Krause's own hands,\nand prepared against every contingency.\n\n'But what about you?'\n\n'Me?' The old scientist laughed morosely.  'I'm an old man.\nDo you think I want to crawl out of one of these things a hundred\ncenturies from now, and try to rebuild what's left of the world?  No,\nWilliam, I don't mind dying.  I'm just glad the two of you came,\nor it would have been much harder.' And at that moment they had in\nfact heard a rumble, and felt the disbelieving earth tremble at the\nnuclear concussion.  But the lights stayed on, and the caskets of life\nstill waited.\n\n'Well,' said Krause grimly.  'Shall we get on with it?'\n\nAnd the young lovers were put into suspension, with precision and good\nhope.\n\nWilliam had woken the prescribed ten-thousand years later, intact,\nroughly one year from the present.  He had lain very still for a time,\nnot understanding, not remembering where he was.  But as the truth\nslowly returned to him he felt no weight of sorrow or loss, but an\nunexpected joy at just being alive.  And he thought of Kathy, so close\nbeside him.  He had saved her!  She was ALIVE, and they would start\nagain.  He forced himself to remain in the soft warmth of the casket a\nwhile longer, as Krause had instructed him.  Then he turned the inner\nhandle, broke the seal, and emerged into the brave new world.\n\nBut even prepared against every contingency things can go wrong, and the\nDevil fingers of Chaos reach into the strongest fortress.  And nothing\nmade by man can endure unchanging the ravages of Time.\n\nSomething had gone wrong with Kathy's support apparatus.  What it was\nhardly matters, and no one ever learned.  But she had died at least a\nthousand years before, and all that the sealed cask had done was to act\nas a mummy's wrap, slowing, but not eliminating her body's natural\ndecomposition.  He rose to find his only love, a half-rotted corpse.\n\nMcIntyre and Jennings had heard the anguished cries, as they searched\nthrough the underground vaults and passageways for the faint life-signs\nthey had detected, and entered the laboratory to find him lying face\ndown on the floor.  Screaming.  He offered no resistance as the doctor\ninjected a sedative, and the two brought him out into the cruel light of\nday.\n\nHis true love was buried, along with all his hopes, and he never spoke\nof her again.\n\n\n*\n\n\nSylviana knew nothing of this tragedy, or of the menace to himself and\nothers that he had since become.  She saw only the obvious way that he\nlooked at her, and the effect it had on Kalus.  The man-child rose\ninstinctively, as if she were in danger, and would have strode down the\nhill sword in hand to confront him.  But Smith, who had seen the sudden\nbrush-fire of his eyes, seized hold of his arm protectively.\n\n'Easy, Kalus.  That's William.  We'll go down together.'\n\nThere in the depression, stiff introductions were made.  Kalus, with the\nhelp of Smith beside him, managed to restrain his emotions, though\nmaking no attempt to conceal them.  For his own part, William sneered at\nhim indifferently, and continued to bathe Sylviana with mock interest\nand open lust.  His only reply to her question, 'Why haven't I\nseen you before?' was a rude:\n\n'Him Tarzan, you Jane.  Me come back tomorrow.' And he had taken\nsome food, without asking or thanks, and made off the way he had come.\n\n'How can you let him treat you that way?' demanded Kalus.\n\nSince the question was directed at no one in particular, Ruth Welles\nreplied, neither apologizing nor defending their actions.  She was a\ntall, serious woman in her mid thirties, with pincers of brown hair\nsurrounding a pleasant face and striking eyes, which revealed to those\nwho knew how to look, a nature both stubborn and compassionate.\n\n'That's just his way,' she said, 'And there are reasons for\nit.  We've all been hurt and bereft by the War, but his pain.....\nLet's just say it's much harder for him to forgive and go one, and\nthat we're all worried about him, because we do care.'\n\n'But he won't let anyone come close enough to help him,' added\nSmith.  'He storms in and out for food, occasionally takes wine or\nmedicine along with it, and that's all we ever see of him.  We helped\nhim set up a laboratory, before we knew what it was for.  We considered\nsmashing it afterward, but what can you do for someone who makes his own\npoison, and flaunts his own destruction?'\n\n'Why?' asked Sylviana.  'What does he use the lab for?'\n\n'To make LSD,' said Welles sadly.  'If there were poppies on\nthe island, no doubt he'd make heroin as well.'\n\nKalus found himself breathing heavily, unable to control it.  He began\nto pace a short distance from them, then suddenly turned and came back,\nhis manner tense and worried.\n\n'Maybe I am wrong to say this.  Maybe I have no right.  But I\ndon't trust that one, and I don't want him near me or mine.' He\nlooked squarely at Sylviana.  'If you have any sense left you will\nstay away from him, whatever you think of me.  He means to hurt you, or\nI know nothing at all.'\n\nBut her gaze was equally unyielding.  'I will see, or befriend,\nwhoever I DAMN well please, and you have nothing to say about it.'\nAnd she returned to her work, as if he wasn't there.\n\nSmith released a breath, Welles shook her head, and Kataya said nothing,\nreproachfully.  Kalus lifted the cub, forlornly lowered his forehead\nagainst it, then turned and walked away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 45\n\n\nAnd so a period of days ensued in which little of note seemed to happen,\nas is often the case when the most potent of life's forces are at\nwork, though beneath the surface and not yet brought to fruition.\nWilliam became a more frequent visitor, and often took long walks with\nSylviana.  Kalus, feeling a genuine desire to work and do his share, as\nwell as needing something to distract him, began to work the fields with\nJim Smith, the botanist, his only real friend among the colonists.  He\nstill spoke to Kataya, but had told her that for a time it was best they\nkeep some distance between them, and she had not objected.  She\nunderstood, and kept a warm secret of the fact that her menstrual cycle\nwas now a week overdue.\n\nUnder other circumstances, Kalus might have fallen in love with the\nrigors and lessons of farming, which taught patience and perseverance,\nand returned the most beautiful and honest of rewards: Life itself.\nWhen Smith told him that by the year 2000 the smaller, family farms of\nAmerica were largely a thing of the past, he thought it a greater\ntragedy than almost any he had heard of.  And unknowingly, as Smith\ncontinued to tell him of his own childhood on the Indiana farm, of his\nfamily's hardships and eventual ruin, Kalus weaved the themes of the\nstory in and out of his own.\n\nBecause as he toiled, he too felt the creeping sense of fatalism that\ntold him all was lost, and the meaning gone out of his life.  He too\nfelt events pushing toward some dark and bitter climax over which he\nseemed to have little control.  All this though he raged, and cursed,\nand worked harder still.  Because Sylviana would not let him near her,\nand heeded none of his warnings.\n\nSo he worked, and waited, and prayed to the wind which knew could not\nhear.  While the woman-child, oblivious, pursued the treacherous shadow\nof revenge.\n\nIt should be said in her defense that Sylviana had not stopped loving\nhim.  Hers, rather, was a classic case of one who has struggled with the\nhelp of another to achieve some desperate goal, but whom, upon attaining\nit, felt that he or she no longer needed the life partner who had been a\npillar of love and support throughout: that she was now free to choose a\nmore appropriate mate for her elevated status, and leave the other to\nget on as they would. As if that made it any better.  Lastly, that if\nshe had been herself she would have wished him no harm, whatever he had\ndone to hurt her.\n\nBut her emotions, too (or so she told herself), were in a violent state\nof flux.  She felt as if she had been the one struck across the face,\nbetrayed and unjustly punished for simply following the inevitable\ncourse of events.  She had never been an evil person, and was not now.\n\nBut a sin of omission can be every bit as deadly, and the venomous\nspider does not stop to ask the nature of its victim before it bites, a\nsoft sting that is hardly felt, until the poison starts to work.\nNeither of them had realized the gift their isolation and struggle had\nbeen, or how much more complicated love becomes when lives are\nsheltered, and hearts confronted by a baffling array of choices.\nPerhaps that was why, as Smith had remarked to Kalus, the well-off never\nseemed to be much in love, but only to play at life.  His love with\nSylviana had been simple and direct, a beautiful and necessary outgrowth\nof their world.  Now their reality had been altered, and something\nprecious lost.\n\nIt should also be said that in dealing with a dark, embittered soul like\nWilliam's (and to a lesser degree, her own), Sylviana was every bit\nas naive as she had been about the primal, life and death existence of\nthe Valley.  Had she known for one minute the vicious hatred that he\nheld for her, or the imminent danger of the course she was now pursuing,\nshe would have fled from him and never looked back.\n\nBecause to William she had become a symbol of all the protected,\nthoughtless sheep whose blind acceptance of personal comfort and\npolitical ruthlessness had made the destruction of the Earth and the\nmurder of his love possible, even inevitable.  He would listen as she\nspoke of her days at Ithaca, and of her soft and sheltered childhood,\nwith apparent interest and appreciation, all the while choking back his\npassion, and plotting her destruction.  In his mind she was the\n\u0091pretty little college whore', and the very strength of his desire\nfor her only intensified his wish to wound her, as he had been wounded,\nto punish and destroy her, as his love had been destroyed.  He hated her\nwith a malice so deep it could fain love without detection, and wallow\nin thoughts of sexual violence without remorse.  The spirit had been\ncharred to ash inside him, leaving only the bestial desires of the\ntwisted animal: lust and hate and vengeance.\n\nBut his plans were not yet ripe, and like the cat, he would play with\nhis victim before killing it.  And perhaps too, though the chance was\nfaint, the smallest part of his conscience remained, and needed further\ngoading before ceasing to rebel.\n\nFor her own part, though she might have wished it otherwise, Sylviana\ncould feel nothing for him but pity and a kind of awe.  At times the\nobsidian hardness of his eyes would push her senses toward the\nprotective realm of fear; but always his words, and her own twisted\npurpose called them back.  She was neither attracted nor repulsed, only\ndetermined.\n\nIn truth she thought little during those final days, following out the\ntreadmill of her plan in a kind of dull stupor, unable, for the pain it\ncost her, to listen to her heart and turn aside.  Her scheme, if such a\nname can be given to walking wide-eyed into a trap, was to sleep with\nhim at a time and place where Kalus would either witness it directly, or\nhear of it straight away.  She meant only to raise the horrible specter\nof betrayal before him, to hurt him as he had done to her.  Beyond that\nshe saw nothing, knew nothing, though some half thought out rationale\ntold her than then, perhaps, she could forgive him.\n\nShe wanted, in short, to summon the demon of Vengeance---to do her\nbidding, then be gone.  But Hell, if it has a master, is no woman's\nslave, and once raised, follows its own path of wanton destruction.  And\nit found in William a willing conspirator, and favorite target of\nseduction: a man who no longer cared.\n\nKalus had spoken of a benevolent current to which, along with his own\nfree will, he would entrust his life.  But there is also a malevolent,\njust as real, and Sylviana was being carried along by it without\nresistance, and without awareness.\n\nAs William plotted, and Kalus burned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 46\n\n\nBut life, and the myriad realities around them, did not cease because\ntwo lovers had been driven apart, or because another lived in the\ndarkened world of near death.  And their interaction, however tragic and\nto whatever end, was hardly its only concern.  Perhaps that is life's\ngreatest cruelty---that it goes on, regardless---or perhaps that is its\ngreatest gift.  Nature, stern father that it is, has many children, and\nthose who have grown must be strong and self-sufficient, able to survive\nand create again, without help or intercession.\n\nThere were others in the camp with lives and dreams and heartbreaks of\ntheir own.  And in the seemingly distant Valley, countless animal young\nwere being born, some who would rise to the magnificent freedom that\nonly an untamed creature of the Wild can know, some who would never\nreach adulthood, their flesh sacrificed to feed the young of others.\nBut all would continue to strive and struggle, not understanding the\nhuman concept of despair.  And if the spirits of those who died returned\nin other forms, or if the energy that constituted their existence was\nmerely recycled, it rose up to struggle again, filled with the endless\nenigma that so bravely turns to face the Night, forever battling death\nand the Void:\n\nDesire, the cornerstone of Life.\n\n\n*\n\n\nOn the day before the storm would break, Sylviana felt a stillness and\nsense of well-being in everything around her: in the gentle breeze of\nearly morning, in the frolicking of the cub with David Rawlings, who\nwould never have been so free with a human companion.  She felt it in\nthe absence of William from the camp, and even in the stubborn,\nunspeaking presence of the man-child.  He would never leave her, of that\nshe was now certain.  And he would be near, very near when tomorrow, at\nlast, her plans would be ripe.\n\nShe no longer felt any hatred towards him.  As their eyes met briefly\nshe even felt the old, half admitted love that had once been the most\nimportant reality of her world.  She didn't hate him.  But she knew\nwhat she had to do.  It didn't have to mean destroying him, which she\nwas equally certain would never happen.  How could steel be destroyed?\nIt couldn't, she thought, only disciplined to be a better servant.\n\nAnd in her live imagination she felt the strong, shy touch of his hands\nacross her back, her ribs and then her breasts, accentuated by kissing\nand tender words, the mouth sliding down across her neck, her chest,\nlicking her nipples and then squeezing and sucking in earnest, the\nmovements of his torso becoming less gentle as his penis grew rigid\nagainst her thigh.  Then he was inside her, with or without her help,\nand began the innumerable thrusts that made of her body a single, roused\nvehicle of warmth and pleasure.  She gently, and not so gently massaging\nhis back, his buttocks.  Till in the last fiery moments of passion he\ncrushed her to him, crying out in a voice made terrible by jealous rage.\n\n'You are mine!'\n\nShe felt the strength of these images in the quickening of her heart,\nand the stirring of her womb.  That the next day she would give herself\nto a man for whom she felt nothing, and who might have feelings of his\nown, she could not realize.  It made it all too cold and sad. But this\ncruelty was not HER doing.  She had not wanted it, or asked for it.  It\nsimply had to be done.  She must think of herself first, be truly\nselfish for once, and let the men work it out as they would.  That Kalus\nmight hurt William, or himself, she refused to consider.  That William\nmight try to hurt HER, was beyond her imagining.\n\nHer eyes were hazy, her senses unaware.  And she did not see the deadly\nserpent that crawled towards her through the grass.  She knew nothing of\nit until the air beside her was rent by the sweep of some instrument\nwhirled in sudden violence.\n\nStartled, she turned to find Rawlings standing, too close it seemed to\nher, then bending down over a wounded snake, pinned to the ground\nbeneath his hoe.  Without hesitation or remorse he drew out his knife,\nand separated it from its head.\n\n'You better wake your ass up, girl,' he said bluntly.  'Or\ndeath will find you, even here.'\n\nBut surely he was being too dramatic.  It was only a little snake.  And\nwhy would anyone or anything want to hurt her, who would not even kill a\nspider if she found it in her bedroom.  But as she looked down at the\nbright bands of color encircling the serpentine corpse, she vaguely\nremembered something nasty about the coral snake.  She moved away with a\nshudder.\n\nBut remembering herself, she looked around quickly.  Kalus was gone---he\nhad not seen.  And Rawlings was walking off without further comment.\nTOO CLOSE, she told herself.  TOO DAMN CLOSE.  She was not sure whether\nshe referred to the snake, or to the show of weakness, when the illusion\nof strength was so critical.....\n\nWELL, replied her harder self, AND WHAT OF IT?  You couldn't let\nsomething like that ruin your whole day.  Especially this day, when she\nhad to be calm, and prepare herself.  She cleared away the dishes as if\nnothing had happened.\n\nAnd Nothing had.\n\nLater that morning she at last admitted her loneliness, and her fear.\nShe wanted to go to Kalus, so badly, to forgive him and start again.....\nBut she could not.  Too much strength remained in her illusions.  So she\nset upon a compromise, going instead to her closest friend among the\ncolonists, a man whose affection was unconditional, and (she thought)\nwithout judgment: Flight Commander Miles Stenmark.\n\nShe found him in the solitary structure a short distance from the camp:\nthe library, or archival building.  Filled with the life-giving books,\ncomputer records, maps and charts, it held a special status among these\nrefugees of Man's destruction, and its deep, quiet interior had the\naura almost of a church.  Sylviana entered soundlessly.\n\nThe Commander sat with his back to her, leaning across a large drafting\ntable.  Before him were spread a series of orbital photographs, which he\nreproduced in minute detail upon a wide, scroll-like map.  She moved\ncloser, standing behind him, needing to feel his reassuring presence\nwhich never wavered, and his friendship which never questioned.\n\nShe began to massage his shoulders, which tensed involuntarily, and then\nsurrendered.  With difficulty she fought back an urge to embrace him,\nand cry like a child.  She continued, but with a softened and\naffectionate touch he could not help but feel.\n\n'Bless you, Sylviana,' he said wearily.  She almost smiled.\n\n'How did you know it was me?'\n\n'I knew.' Then, as if this conveyed too much.  'Ruth Welles\nalways tells me I'm working too hard, and Kataya's fingers feel\nlike flesh wrapped around steel, though she means well.....  I'm\nafraid she's still not quite comfortable around me.  Around any of\nus, really.'\n\n'Why?' asked the younger woman, unable to feign indifference.\n\n'Will you promise not to hold it against her?  I wish the two of you\ncould make peace.  There's so much that's good in both of you.'\n\nSylviana sighed deeply, again fighting off the urge to embrace him and\npour out her heart.  'I'll try.  Why, then?'\n\n'She still has too much resentment against the west.'\n\nShe moved to stand beside him, her look intent.  'From what?'\n\n..  'A large number of Japanese, including her grandparents, died a\nslow and terrible death from the radiation left behind by the bombing of\nHiroshima.  And here, now, losing everything to a War in which her\ncountry played no part, but was decimated nonetheless, killing her\nhusband.  And to lose the baby the way she did---not even knowing she\nwas pregnant, then coming out of suspension to immediate miscarriage,\nhormonal crash, and the end of the world as she knew it. . .sweet\nSavior.  It would have killed almost anyone else.  You HAVE to forgive\nher, Sylviana.  It's not her fault.'\n\nShe pulled up another stool and sat beside him, silent and thoughtful.\nFinally she said. 'It's not my fault, either.'\n\nStenmark sighed.  'She knows that, on an intellectual level.  But to\nlose so much.' His expression became faraway, recalling perhaps some\nbitter pain of his own.  'So much suffering.'\n\nSylviana looked full into his face, deeply stirred by the physical and\nemotional closeness to this wise and noble man, who had seen and known\nso much of life.  And in that moment she wanted nothing more in the\nworld than to nestle against him, to feel him put his arm around her\nprotectively, kiss her gently, and tell her it would be all right.\nKataya no longer mattered.  This mattered.  She wanted to give herself\nto him, as Kalus had to her rival.  Even bear him a child.....  And\nsuddenly she knew that was it.  His sorrow.  Not a loving spouse\nperhaps, but a child lost.  How much more terrible and bitter that\nsting, to lose one innocent, and with a lifetime ahead of him.  Or her.\nTears welled in her eyes.\n\n'I'm so sorry,' she said, both understanding.\n\n'Yes.  It would have been harder.  But for you.'\n\nAnd in that moment, to be so close, their sides lightly touching, was a\nblessed intimacy for which no words exist, and in which there is no\nstain.  She leaned closer to examine his work, though if the page before\nhim were blank she would still have done the same.\n\n'What are you working on, Miles?' She was the only one among the\ncompany who called him by his first name, and then only in private.\nSuch was the respect they all held for him, who had sacrificed so much\nfor their well-being.  And she could not restrain herself from touching\nhim lightly on the arm.  He turned toward her gratefully, smiling, then\nturned back to his work, so deeply reluctant to complicate or even\ninjure her young life.\n\n'I'm trying to chart. . .the topographical changes that took place\nduring the first two decades after.' There was no need to clarify\n\u0091after'.  'You see, so far as I know, I'm the only one who\nsaw it.  And the photographs can only tell you so much.....  Do you want\nme to go on.' She nodded tearfully.\n\n'I want to recreate the full magnitude of the aftershock, as vividly\nas possible.  I try to do this through maps and computer enhancements,\nalong with the written account, which I'm afraid I'll never\nfinish.'\n\n'Are you sure it's worth the heartbreak?' she asked\nsorrowfully.  'Why not just leave it in the past, and go on?'\n\n'Because it's important,' he said, 'For the same reason it\nwas important for the Germans to see the concentration camps after World\nWar II, and to give an honest account of what happened to them as a\npeople, that could ever allow such unspeakable atrocities.  From my\nobservations, it was because everything was dealt with abstractly,\nthrough dangerous philosophies and brilliantly sinister propaganda.\nThey were taught to rationalize the deaths of others as the only means\nof caring for themselves: in order for their families to live, all\nothers must die.  And blinded by their desire for this utopian world\nthey never saw, until it was too late, the true horror and vicious\nsadism of the Nazis.'\n\nSylviana wept silently, recalling images of the Holocaust, set against\nmemories of German families she had known, so loving, nurturing, hard\nworking.  'How horrible.'\n\n'Yes.  As it's been said many times, we must learn from the\nmistakes of history, or we're doomed to repeat them.  We must all\nrealize what we're capable of, when we close our hearts, and allow\nour minds to justify such brutal and inhuman acts.  Or we DON'T learn,\nuntil it's too late.' He gave a bitter sigh.  'Until it comes\nto this.'\n\nNeeding perhaps some escape from the relentless intensity of these\ntruths, her eyes took in the map before her: the northern Atlantic.  The\naltered North American coast formed one boundary, the European the\nother. She studied the latter quietly, not wanting to look too closely\nat the plunder of her native America.\n\nThe European main did not at first look radically different, her eyes\nreadily identifying Italy, though the \u0091boot' had been rounded off,\nand Spain, similarly worn so that the strait of Gibraltar was now broad\nenough to pass a small country through.  But as her gaze continued\ntoward France and the Netherlands.....  Something was missing.  NO.  It\ncouldn't be.\n\n'Where are the British Isles?' The home of her deepest ancestors.\nA last, disbelieving hope.  'Or haven't you drawn them yet?'\n\n'They're gone,' he said somberly, 'Along with all of\nScandinavia, my home.....  A huge rift opened between them and the\nmainland, here, and swallowed them like Atlantis.  I watched it happen,\nday by day, year by year.  And Sweden.  It was one of the saddest\nexperiences of my life.  To watch the destruction of that beautiful\nland, from which my ancestors set out in many-oared galleys, practically\nrowing themselves, when the winds weren't favorable, all the way to\nnorthern Canada, centuries before Columbus. When I think of the courage\nand determination that must have taken, to brave the storms and chilling\nwaters.  All lost, the chain of humanity broken forever, ending with me,\nin the grim twilight of a futile existence.'\n\nHe forgot his own emotions as he found the young girl collapsed upon his\nchest, sobbing like a frightened child.  After a moment's hesitation,\nin which he saw that restraint would be tantamount to cruelty, he put\nhis arm around her and brought her close, kissed her forehead and said\ngently.  'Don't cry, little Sylvie (the name he had heard her\nfather use those many years before).  It's over now.'\n\n'But it's not over,' she said wretchedly.  'It's not.\nAnd if you only knew what I was going to do.  You'd hate me.\nYou'd never speak to me again.  It's too awful.....  And I\ndon't WANT to.  I don't want to.'\n\nHe waited for her to become quieter.  'The only thing I couldn't\nforgive, and that I don't understand, is why you keep punishing\nyourself.  The way you've withdrawn, and won't let anyone close to\nyou. Especially Kalus.' He knew from the hurt look she gave him that\nhe had struck upon the heart of her unhappiness.  'Or is it him\nyou're trying to punish?'\n\n'You don't understand,' she said weakly.  And she would have\ntold him, and perhaps have found in his wisdom a way to let go, and\nrenounce the evil thing that she proposed.  But at that moment she heard\na voice outside the open door.\n\n'I thought I saw her go into the library,' answered McIntyre to an\nunknown questioner.  She stiffened, quickly wiped the tears from her\neyes.  Kataya knocked lightly, then entered.\n\n'Hello, Commander.  Am I disturbing you?  I'd hoped to speak with\nSylviana.' There was no animosity in her voice.  If anything, it was\nsoftened and conciliatory.  'Would it be all right?'\n\nThough the question had been directed to Stenmark, Sylviana felt the\nintrusion keenly, as if she had received yet another slight from this\nwoman, who continued to encroach upon her most intimate acquaintances.\n\n'Anything you have to say to me,' she replied without turning,\n'You can say in front of the Commander.'\n\nStenmark began to rise diffidently, but she took his arm and would not\nlet him, unsure herself if she wanted his strength to lean upon, or\nsimply did not wish to grant anything so personal to the woman who had\nhurt her so badly.\n\n'Really, Sylviana, maybe I should go.' But the childlike anguish\nhe saw in the honest look she gave him, made him turn instead with a\nsigh.\n\n'Please come in,' he said.\n\n'Are you sure, Sylviana?  It's very personal.'\n\n'You heard my answer,' she said coldly, still not turning.\n'Speak to me here, or not at all.'\n\n'All right.  The Commander will have to be informed in any case.'\nKataya took a deep breath, trying with all her self-discipline not to\nsound too triumphant.\n\n'The tests were positive.  I'm going to have a child.  By Kalus.\nI wanted to explain that it changes nothing between you, and that I feel\nno hostility---'\n\nBut Sylviana broke her off, whirling in a frenzy.  'You sorry Asian\nWHORE!  Sleeping with him behind my back, and humiliating me again and\nagain!'\n\n'No,' said Kataya calmly, firmly.  'There was only the one\ntime, which never would have happened.....  But it did happen, for which\nI'll always be grateful.  I just wanted to tell you that I bear you\nno grudge, and would never try to steal him from you.'\n\nSylviana stood in shocked silence.  And though her face and whole\nbearing were hostile and inconsolable, Kataya realized they might never\nspeak again.  Better to say it all now, and have done.\n\n'Taking him away from you was never my motive.  And though I am\ndeeply fond of him.....  Can't you see how much he loves you?\nPASSIONATELY, single-heartedly.  Don't you know how much that's\nworth?  I've only experienced it once in my life, and I would give\nall the world to have that back.....  My gentle husband, so unlike the\nhard, cruel men among whom he was raised.'\n\n'Get out!' screamed Sylviana, 'Before I tear your eyes out!\nYou MONSTER.  You whore.' And she fell to weeping.\n\nKataya swallowed hard, then left to control her own emotions.  Rising,\n        Stenmark spoke for her, perhaps for all the company.\n        'Sylviana.  SYLVIE.  I know you don't want to hear this\n        right now, but I think you have to.'\n\nThe young woman fell back upon the stool, sobbing.  Touched with pity\nthough he was, the aging Commander knew he could not comfort her until\nhe had made her see the truth.\n\n'The men of Japan, Kataya's ancestors, were every bit as cruel as\nthe Germans during World War II.  They killed millions in their march\nthrough Asia, raping women to death, cutting men to pieces, never\nsparing the children.....  So that when America finally developed the\natomic bomb, those with the power to use it had very little sympathy\nleft.  But loosing that atomic death, whose lingering effects were not\nyet known, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, making war against the innocent\nwomen and children of that tragic country.....  One atrocity doesn't\njustify another.' And while he was not sure she would understand the\nparallel, he knew no other way of reaching her.\n\n'The problem with revenge, Sylviana, is that you never hurt the\npeople you're trying to, but only create new victims.  Your country\ncondemned to a slow and horrible death, by all the ills and cancers of\nradiation poisoning, more than a million men, women and children who had\nno knowledge of, and took no willing hand in, the butcheries of their\nmilitary government.'\n\n'I don't care!' cried the young woman bitterly.  'You have\n        to care,' said Stenmark grievously, 'Even if it happened\n        before you were born.  And even then, that's only the smaller\n        part of Kataya's anger.  You lost your father, as we all lost\n        those dear to us.....  Imagine if you had lost Kalus, in the\n        full flower of your pure and uncorrupted love for him?  And not\n        only Kalus, but the innocent life his seed had planted in your\n        womb.' But Sylviana only wept harder, unable to feel anything\n        but her own pain.\n\n'She may be the last Japanese left alive,' he continued.  'And\nthe silent suffering forced on the women of that country by their\nculture is beyond any power of mine to convey.  Should it all be for\nnaught?  Hate the men of that time if you want; sometimes I do myself.\nBut not the women.  God love them.....\n\n'She has the right to bear a child, Sylviana, and to choose that\nchild's father.  Think about that the next time you find yourself\nhating her, or despising the blessed and innocent life that now grows\ninside her.  I don't think you'll have the heart to hate her then.\nNot in your worst moments.'\n\nBut it was all too much for her: too overwhelming to forgive, or even\nunderstand.  She raised herself, angrily pushing away the hands that\nwould have comforted her, and ran out of the room with a wordless cry of\npain and self-loathing.  And kept on running, as if the Devil ran behind\nher.\n\nIn time she slowed to a walk, though she could no more stop moving than\ndeny her lungs the air they screamed for.  'Just walk!' she cried.\n'WALK.  Until you can't feel anything.'\n\nBut after another mile she stopped, and knelt down and wept for the\nthird time.  Because she knew that she would do it.  She would betray\nthe one she loved most.  Until she made him feel her pain, thinking\nnothing of his own---\n\n'I don't care!' she cried, raging, the three words which so\noften precede the worst that we are.  And though they were not entirely\ntrue in her case, the tragic end is often identical.\n\nShe would go through with the evil act.  She would do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 47\n\n\nThat night Kalus dreamed he was alone in a dark cave, too small and dank\nfor a man.  But the light rose slowly through a stone-lipped entrance,\nand he saw a familiar form beside him as he sank into the wall, to\nwatch.  Kamela lay with three cubs beside her.  But two had been turned\nto stone.  He struggled to wake himself, because he knew what was to\ncome.\n\nA large wolf entered, looking black, and bared its yellow fangs.\nAnother stood guard outside as the earth parted to admit the terrible\nand magnificent bastard, Shar-hai.  He entered, silent as death, and\nlifted the living cub and set it gently, almost lovingly, in a corner.\nKamela never once moved, or changed her expression as they came closer,\nsnarling sadistically.\n\nThey raped her, as he struggled to break free.  Only then it was no\nlonger Kamela, but Sylviana they raped, and the face of Shar-hai became\nhuman as it tore at her.  He struggled desperately and called her name\nas Smith and Rawlings pinned him to the floor.  BUT THEY'RE MY FRIENDS!\nHe cried out to her with heart-crushing passion, as the sound of it\nfilled his ears, and woke him.\n\n\n*\n\n\nHe lay on his back, wet with sweat, unable to remember.  He threw off\nthe sleeping bag which now seemed to him a coffin, or a mummy's wrap.\nHe tried to shake off the dream, but the images of Kamela's rape had\nnever left him, and those of Sylviana as the victim transferred\nthemselves with terrifying ease.  His own reality, as it returned to\nhim, seemed far less real.  And it came as no surprise as he recognized\nthe human face of Shar-hai.  It was William, his teeth like knives.\n\nThe sun was climbing: she would be awake.  But this was only an\nafterthought, as he ran toward the compound.  He threw open the first\ndoor, then the second, and burst into the room he had never seen.  She\nwas there, half dressed, seeming but a continuation of the dream from\nwhich he felt he had not woken.  For there was no waking from the truth.\n\n'Sylviana,' he pleaded, closing the door while she glared at him.\n'You must not see William today.  I have seen a terrible vision.  And\nI know, as I have always known.....  He will rape you, and try to hurt\nyou!  Perhaps he will even (the thought was unendurable), KILL you.'\n\nShe forced herself to finish dressing calmly, as he forced himself not\nto touch her.  But as she tried to walk past him as if he did not exist,\nhe could contain himself no longer.  He seized her by the arms, and both\nlost control.\n\n'You can't go to him!' he shouted.  'I won't LET you.'\nAnd his hands were like claws.  Then they softened, along with his eyes,\nand he all but begged her.  'PLEASE.'\n\n'Take your hands off me!' she cried, breaking free with a terrible\nstrength of her own.  'Don't you touch me, ever!' He drew back\nfrom her, trembling.\n\n'Haven't you punished me long enough?' he said.  'I am\nSORRY.  For this.  For everything. I am in agony; is that what you\nwanted?  But I am also afraid for you, mortally afraid.  In some things\nyou are still very naive.  You can't see, no one can see, what he\nwill do to you!  But I know the look in his eyes, because I have seen it\nbefore.  It stood in front of me in the arena, at no greater distance\nthan the length of my sword---'\n\n'Shut up!' she screamed.  'You shut up!  What do you know about\nMEN?  You couldn't, because you're barely more than an ape\nyourself.  Go back to your beloved hill-people, and eat rotten meat in\nthe dirt!'\n\nBut here she paused, remembering her purpose.  And through the heat of\nthe first real hatred she had ever felt for him, came the cold touch of\npoise in the act of betrayal, and she knew with a twisted thrill what it\nwas to surrender to Evil.\n\n'But if you're really worried,' she said placidly, 'Wait for\nme at the Vale of the Obelisk.  I'll meet you there at noon, to tell\nyou of our love-making.  And then we'll say goodbye, forever.'\n\nShe strode out, and left him shaking.  He fell to his knees and wept,\nmuch as William had screamed, to find his lover dead.  He was alone in a\ndark cave, too small and dank for a man.....\n\n\n*\n\n\nWilliam did not wake, because he had not slept.  He told himself that he\nwas letting it build inside him, mounting toward the kill.  But in truth\nhe was far beyond even that.  The amphetamines he had injected though\nevery voice of body and mind cried against it, ate him like a cancer.\nHe had lost all control.  This would be an act of vengeance, but not his\nvengeance.  Somewhere in the mincer of pain and loss he had become the\nvery thing he had fought all his life against, what he swore he would\nnever become: an instrument in someone else's, someTHING else's\nhands.  He could not admit this.  He could not admit, or think, of\nanything.  For his mind was no longer his own.  Not by a conscious act\nof submission---\n\nHe gave a violent cry and hurled a bottle at the crumbling half-wall.\nAs it shattered, as he saw the broken glass and knew what it could do to\nhuman flesh, he remembered his purpose.  In large, painful gulps he\ndrained most of a second bottle, letting the wine take the place of\nblood in his veins.\n\nHe would be Master yet.  The sun was up and it was day.  He would have\nher, and then destroy her.  Then destroy himself.  Nothing else\nmattered, and Nothing never needed justification.  It simply was, the\nonly truth: the hole when the bottom fell out.  It was the naked razor,\nstalking through the streets, cutting out men and women at random.\nLetting some grow fat for its later pleasure.  Wantonly hewing the poor,\nwho though possessed of a greater capacity for suffering, had reached\nthe limits of endurance and could be tortured no more.\n\nHe had become a willing servant of the thing he had always fought, and\nfeared.  But he did not care.\n\nHe did not care.\n\n\n*\n\n\nWhen he came to her, as arranged, there was a moment when Sylviana saw\nwhat Kalus had seen: a wild, desperate hunger in his eyes, that could no\nlonger feed on things which the earth gave as food.  They wanted not\nflesh, but blood, not nourishment, but to mock the very act of\nnourishment.  They could not be fed, or appeased, any more than one\ncould quench the rape of napalm fire.\n\nShe turned away, and felt her heart throb violently in revulsion and\nfear.  Only the perverse pride and will that had slowly taken hold of\nher, kept her from running away at the sight of him.  This, and the\nstubborn naivet\u00e9 of the illusioned, which told her this instinctive\nfear was a flaw of perception: that true, malignant evil did not exist,\nand that things could not possibly come to the ends envisioned by\nnightmare imagination.  It was the same voice that told the world the\nHolocaust could not happen, was not happening, even as six million Jews,\nRussians, intellectuals, homosexuals and other defenseless minorities,\nwere led to the fire.  She listened to that voice, and made it her\nisland of hope, the one that made the twisted dream of murder and\nhealing, kindness through cruelty, destruction and rebuilding, still\npossible.  Like one who had stared too long at the sun, insisting there\nwas no danger, she was completely blind.\n\nShe turned back to him, more composed, and wondered only why he made no\nattempt to aid her: to dim the cutting laser of his eyes.\n\nBut he was through with hiding, and playing the part of the weak and\nworshipful lover.  LET HER SEE! rang the twisted chime of his thoughts,\ndistorted and horrible.  Let her walk into the jaws of death with eyes\nwide open.  And this choice also was correct: that his eyes and\nintentions were obvious, only made them the more impossible to believe.\n\nShe merely said, 'Shall we go?' And she couldn't understand why\nat that moment she should think of the black widow that her father had\nfound in her bedroom as a child, killing it as she cried at his cruelty.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus sat on a piece of broken stone with his head in his hands, unable\nyet to look up and go on.  Alaska stood before him, puzzled.  Her young\nmind had continued to develop, so that now she was aware of her\nexistence as clearly, if without the same complexity, as any human\nadolescent.  In the preceding weeks she had realized that such a choice\nmight come: a choice between the two people she loved.  And for reasons\nno more complicated than simple feeling, she had chosen Kalus, had\nremained with him as he lay helpless on the floor, and not followed when\nSylviana called to her angrily.\n\nIt was his one compensation.  He knew that if he left the colony the cub\nwould go with him, regardless of what lay ahead.  It was that simple,\nand that beautiful.  And in that moment, alone and forlorn among the\nruins of yet another tortured depression, this singular act of giving\nbroke his heart.  Because he saw in her pure, animal innocence the thing\nthat he had always wanted from a woman, but had not dared to ask:\n\nLoyalty, which so many have forgotten, and for which there is no other\nword.  And not the pale imitation of it found in some marriages, which\ndemand that each cut off and subvert some part of themselves, to be\njoined like hobbled twins at the place of amputation.  What he wanted\nwas nothing more and nothing less than the bond of true allies: not half\na woman, because of him, but a whole woman, for the same reason.  Not to\nenslave but to enrich, not to question in time of crisis, but to love\nand support, not blindly, but freely and fully.  All these things he had\noffered her; but he knew they meant nothing if she was unwilling to give\nthe same in return.  Because there is no such thing as one-sided love.\n\nHe did not know how he understood these things, or why they had come to\nhim now, only that he knew them, and that their truth was unbending.\nYes.  He would wait for her at the designated time and place.  If she\ncame to him and said she could not do it, and asked his help to rebuild\nthe things that they had lost, he would remain with her forever.\n\nBut if she came to him in mocking triumph---if she ever again spoke to\nhim as she had---all was finished between them.  He would leave her,\nleave this place, and never look back.  There was no middle ground.\nBecause he knew finally, defiantly, that he was physically incapable of\nbeing other than himself, and should never have tried to be.  The\nconsequences of rejection would be devastating, and in the cold light of\nday he did not know how he would find the will to go on, without her.\nBut this no longer mattered.  Nothing mattered, but that this agony and\nfear must end.  There was no other way.\n\nHe rose and walked the remaining distance.  To the Vale of the Obelisk.\nTo wait.\n\n\n***\n\n\nSO FAR IT'S GONE WELL ENOUGH, she told herself, though she still could\nnot look at him, or one second further than the present.  They sat\ntogether on the sunlit slope of a wide, grassy recession.  Its quiet\nsymmetry would have been lovely and serene, but for a single thrust of\ngnarled stone which pierced its center, ringed about the base by a\nmatting of jagged weeds.  The company called it Devil's Thumb.  It\nwas a protrusion of the devil to be sure, but she wasn't at all sure\nthat \u0091thumb' was the correct metaphor.  She kept her eyes away\nfrom it, concentrating instead on the white sheet spread beneath them,\non the bread and wine before them.\n\nHe had brought the wine, for which she was grateful, and she drank of it\nprobably more than she should.  But it gave her confidence, and helped\ndull the edge of her rebelling senses.  Perhaps half an hour had passed\nfrom the time of her first ready mouthful; and he smiled each time the\nglass touched her lips.  If an eerie contraction of taut face muscles\ncan be called a smile.\n\n'Have you ever done hallucinogenic drugs?' He tried to ask\ncarelessly, but could not quite pull it off.\n\n'What on earth made you ask that?'\n\n'Oh, nothing really.  Just curious.' She wished he would stop\nlooking at her that way.\n\n'Yes I have.  Once, with Kalus.  We.....  It was peyote.'\n\n'How much did you do?'\n\n'Two buttons each.  One right away.....  Why are you laughing?'\n\n'Two peyote buttons, and you think you've seen it all.  Ha!  That\nwouldn't be enough to open your pretty little eyelids.' She\nwondered why she suddenly felt restless and irritable.\n\n'What makes you think it's only how much, and not how pure?  Or\nmaybe we just didn't need to have our whole consciousness blown away\nto get something meaningful from it.' She felt angry, defiant, and\nhorribly uncomfortable.  'I could do LSD if I wanted to.'\n\n'Could you now?  We're going to find out.' She felt the touch\nof an icy hand inside her.\n\n'What do you mean?'\n\n'The wine is laced with it.'\n\nAnd the current closed over her head.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus sat in the fore of the leering monolith, which lay just inside the\nrim of the oblong vale.  The dwarfish Obelisk, like a pointed tombstone,\nlay swart and square in its center.  Kalus remembered the first time he\nhad come here, driven on by Sylviana's almost distracted haste to\nfind others of her kind.  AND TO ESCAPE, he thought bitterly, HER\nDEPENDENCE ON ME.  It was here, beneath the monolith, that he had tried\nto cleanse and bandage the wound on her leg.  The memory and sight of\nit, of blood on her beloved flesh, filled all his thoughts.  Through the\nstrong taste of pride and anger, a fresh and cutting sense of worry\nreturned to him.  The protective instinct was too strong inside him, and\nwhat they had shared, too deep.\n\nHe thought of following after her, but did not know which way she had\ngone, and doubted Alaska's ability (as well as his own) to find and\nisolate her most recent trail among the layered and crisscrossing paths\nof the colonists.  He could only wait, and watch the sun wheel the\nshadows around him.  When the longer shadow of the Monolith joined that\nof the deeply carved Obelisk, locking together into a long sword of\ndarkness upon the earth, it would be time.  And she must come to him.\n\nBut that remained at least two hours away.  He looked down at the\ndeerskin pouch, which had slipped from his shoulder and rested, half\nopen, on the ground.  Remembering one of its contents, he emptied it out\nonto a gray, porous stone before him.\n\nThere, beside the wrapped hunting knife (which she now refused to\ncarry), the whet-stone, and the flints for making fire, he saw them.\nDryer, less green, but still potent in their otherworldly magic: the\nfive remaining peyote buttons.  He lifted one and turned it in his hand,\nwondering.  It had helped him to understand once before.....  Perhaps it\nwould show him something now, which he could see no other way.\n\nGuided by an impulse he did not completely understand, and half against\nhis better judgment, he put the first in his mouth, and chewed it.  Then\nslaked his throat with water.  Again.  And a short time later, again.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThere are no words to describe LSD.  For the person who has taken it\nbefore it is still like landing from another planet: nothing is\nfamiliar, and nothing can be taken for granted.  Everything is powerful,\nevocative, unknown.  For the person who has not, it is like a bewildered\nand even unconscious dream.  If the experience is good, it is life at\nits deepest and most intense.  If it is bad, there is no greater horror\non the Earth.  And in either case, the mind is never quite the same.\nDoors are opened which cannot later be shut, and some residue, both\nchemical and spiritual, remains forever.\n\nThe acid that William had made was not particularly strong or pure, and\nthis alone saved her sanity.  But it was strong enough, and tinged with\nstrychnine and speed.  She could not hide, from anything.\n\nSylviana tried to master her panic.  And so far, by the narrowest of\nmargins she had succeeded.  ALL RIGHT, she told herself.  All right.  It\nhad happened.  There was nothing to done now but see it through.  Except\nthat she kept forgetting what the words meant, forgetting the words she\nsaid, forgetting words.  She was alone in a gruesome place with a man\nshe did not know or trust.  She could not force herself to remain there\na moment longer.\n\n'We have to go,' she said, rising.  The motion, scarcely felt,\nelevated her head, the line of her sight.  But she could not shake the\nfeeling of being deep under the water, lungs bursting for air.  She\nwanted to swim with all her strength, upward toward the surface.  But\nsome horrible weight, or cold serpentine grip held her down, wrapped\nabout her legs and ankles.  That grip was her obsession.  The\nlife-saving air was Kalus, and she knew it.\n\nBut no, her stupor-rationale insisted.  It's not so.  I can breathe.\nI can walk.  She strode to the top of the hill, feeling a moment's\nrelease, only to find that William had followed her soundlessly, like a\nshadow.  And that she no longer knew where she was, or how to find her\nway back.\n\nBACK.  To what?\n\nAnd then the real fear, the telling blows, began to find her.  Because\nit seemed, it was, an overriding certainty that there was no returning.\nThis was reality, doubly real.  She had fallen into a bottomless pit.\nNO WAY OUT!\n\n'Let's go for a walk,' said William gently, now so sure of his\nprey that he was almost disappointed.  But he would see it through, and\nknew that to do so he must build her up again, just enough.  Then tear\nher down.  Again, until the moment was ripe.  And then God help her.\n\nBut Sylviana was there ahead of him.  She clung to this mockery of care\nand affection, five simple words, with all the desperate power of her\ndesire not to believe.  'Yes, my dear, sweet William.  Let's go\nfor a walk.' And he smiled, a moment of sympathy that he knew would\nonly make the fire of his hatred burn the whiter.  She might make the\ngoing pleasing, after all.\n\n'Yes,' he said wryly.  'A walking tour of the neighborhood.\nI'll show you how the other half. . .dies.'\n\nSo they set out, Sylviana forgetting that this unraveled the last of her\nplans, and that Kalus would no longer be close at hand.\n\nFor better or worse.\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus remained, still as the stone on which he sat.  He had moved some\ntime before to the more level ground before the Obelisk, though the\ngrotesque figures carved upon it kept him from coming too close.  The\npeyote had begun to work on him, but its effect was entirely different\nthan what he had hoped.  Instead of giving him peace and a quiet\nunderstanding, it filled him with a dread that was almost physical.  All\nhis thoughts, worded and otherwise, seemed to crash in upon themselves\nlike the breaking of a wave, crushing and smothering every positive\nimpulse, every hopeful thought within him.  He was back in the hopeless\nworld of his past, from which she had helped him to escape.\n\nBut there was no escape.  No matter how he turned it around, no matter\nwhat contingencies he tried to make and force himself to swallow, the\nbitter truth remained.  Without his woman he had nothing: no love, no\npurpose, no home.  No way to go on, and no reason to try.  The ancient\nsense of fatalism and betrayal returned to him, with still greater\nintensity, because for a time he had been free.  And the brief interval\nof spoken words and close female companionship evaporated, could no\nlonger protect him from the silent, brutal worlds he had known.  Again\nhe saw before him the long chain of savagery and violence, of endless\npain and pointless perseverance.  All leading to this.  To be broken and\nalone, as only the last of a species is alone.\n\nHe too felt the razor, though dully.  And his one regret in those\ndarkened moments was that he had been so skilled in eluding it.\n\n\n*\n\n\n'Forty-second street,' said William, continuing in the manner of a\ntour through Hell.  They stood at the base of a long, flat stretch, like\na sunken airport runway before them, the grassy dikes to either side\nstill suggestive of the tombs, the mass graves they barely covered.\n\n'You see before you a busy street---strip joints, adult book stores,\npornographic theaters.  But you don't seem to notice the background\nmuch.  No.  It's the ragged flowers springing from the sidewalk that\ncatch and hold your eye: prostitutes, the whipping girls of the city.\n\n'On a good day all they're required to do is give their bodies to\npawing, drooling idiots, who in their half-assed passion call them\n\u0091mother', \u0091cheap whore', or the name of some long-lost\nlover.  Oh, but of course they don't really FEEL anything.\nThey're not real people, like you and I.' At this he curled his\nlip, barely able to contain his rage.  'On bad days.....  They're\nharassed and preyed upon by police, jaded social workers and psychotic\nkillers, or just beaten and abused by the \u0091fatherly' pimps.\n\n'And what is their crime, that makes them the object of universal\nscorn and reprisal?  They're VICTIMS, vulnerable, bringing out the\npredatory instinct in all of us.  And more than that, they commit the\nmost unforgivable sin of all: they make us look at ourselves, and see\nsomething about our pretty little world that we don't like.  Because\nthey do, in fact, what the rest of us do in spirit: sell themselves,\nbody and soul, for MONEY.  Only they lack the skills and social graces,\nlike the ones you learned in college, to be subtle and self-justifying\nabout it.  They are OBVIOUS, and much too real, an easy target for\nnearly everyone.  And the human animal never misses easy prey.'\n\nSylviana heard the words---stark and depressing enough---but what gave\nthem their power were the images her own memory provided.  She saw it\nall: the rooster-like pimps grabbing gaudily dressed women by the hair,\nand without remorse throwing them into the back seats of still gaudier\ncars, for later punishment, which no doubt included beating and rape.\nAnd if her head happened to strike the roof, starting a rivulet of\nblood.....\n\nAnd she remembered the murder she had so nearly witnessed: saw the chalk\noutline that the homicide detectives had drawn on the sidewalk as the\nparamedics arrived to wheel her into a waiting ambulance, her death a\nforegone conclusion, the eyes still terrified though the life even now\nfled from them.  A face once young and fair: a sixteen-year-old runaway\nfrom nameless suburbs, driven from her home perhaps by an abusive\nparent, drawn to the city like a moth to flame.  And brought to the same\nend.  While the jagged man the police had cuffed and were dragging away,\nscreamed in bursts of occasional coherence, 'All women are\nwhores!'\n\nAnd she remembered too, even as he said, the thoughts that she had\nalways used to dismiss such women, and the hopeless tragedy of their\nlives.  HOW CAN THEY DO IT?  THEY MUST JUST TURN OFF THEIR MINDS, AND\nNOT FEEL ANYTING.....  IT'S AWFUL, BUT SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN\nTO WALK THE STREETS ALONE.  As if this was something she had done of her\nown volition, and against the warnings of loved ones and friends.  And\nshe thought of her own plan, which was worse.  Not to sleep with a man\nfor money, which could at least claim the honest shred of need.  But for\nrevenge.\n\nAnd coming back to herself for a moment, she realized with a sudden\nshock that this same plan, along with the subconscious safety valve she\nhad built into it, were now completely out of hand.  She had no idea\nwhere they were (in relation to anything else), only where they\nweren't: within hearing range of Kalus, on whom she had relied to\nprotect her at need.  As the dagger of fear sank an inch lower into her\nbreast.\n\n'You're right William,' she said hurriedly.  'And it's\nhorrible.  But please, please take me somewhere else.' Sheer movement\nseemed the only defense from the razor---\n\n'My GOD.' There seemed to be a literal razor forming out of the\nair before her, a glint of sunlight on cold steel.  She cowered, and\ncrossed her arms defensively in front of her.\n\n'Oh, no, not yet,' said the Stranger, as if he understood it all.\nHe seized her by one foreshortened arm, and led her toward the next\nexhibit.  After an interminable length of time he stopped again, and\npointed.\n\n'Seventh Avenue.'\n\n\n*\n\n\nKalus remained, still as stone, but no longer in confusion and despair.\nHe stood rooted to the spot in horror.\n\nThe two shadows had met and become one, a broadsword of Death upon the\nwounded earth.  The sun was now directly south of the monolith.  Yet it\nwas not the Shadow, but a patch of wicked, unexpected Light that showed\nhim in a searing instant the real danger into which his woman had\nfallen, and the true Evil that walked upon the earth.  A square-cut hole\nhigh in the center of the monolith, hidden earlier by its vague,\nuncontoured grayness, now let through a shaft of light, which came to\nrest in impossible coincidence upon a single carving of the dwarfish\nObelisk: the face of a horned Devil, its lolling tongue six inches long,\nwas held in the internal pentagon of a ghoulish star, pointing downward.\nCarved perhaps by some mutant from the days when half-men, like lepers,\nstill clung to the fire-pillaged rock, it looked down upon the slab of\naltar at its feet, just large enough for a child, just deep enough to\ncontain its flowing blood.  As remorseless and aroused, the Beast smiled\nin the helpless light of day.\n\n'Sylviana!' he cried aloud, knowing now that only he could save\nher.  No answer.  He stood up and called again, one last act of\ndesperation.\n\nNothing.  He went down on one knee, and patted the ground with his open\nhand.  He needed no more prodding.  The time had come to act.\n\n'Alaska,' he whispered intently.  'Sylviana.  SYLVIANA.'\nThis time the cub seemed to understand, and apparently had some insight\nas to where they might be found, for she set out at once.  Or at least\nsome idea where they might begin to look.\n\nIf it was not already too late.\n\n\n*\n\n\n'Stop it!  Stop it!' she cried, covering her face with her hands.\nShe had gone with him, and listened as he spoke of junkies, toxic waste,\nvictims and violence and hospitals.  From place to place, in growing\nhorror, thinking with one last gasp of real courage that perhaps she\ndeserved this, and needed to know.\n\nBut when he brought her at last to the ruins of an enormous research\nfacility, and began to describe, in detail, the torturous experiments\nperformed here on bound, terrified animals in the name of progress and\nthe greater good, she felt the tip of the blade licking at her heart.\n\nBecause she knew it was true.  Her father had been assigned here as an\nintern.  He had stormed out in a rage at the asphyxiation, force-feeding\nof toxic substances, vivisection, 'Sweet Jesus,' and \u0091stress\ntests', performed on dogs and cats, rhesus monkeys and other\nprimates, some more intelligent than the lackeys who tormented them.\nRefusing to participate had put his career in jeopardy, something he was\nwilling to do, to stand up against what he knew was wrong and\nindefensible.  And he had spoken out against the Horror, for those who\ncould not speak.\n\nBut many of his colleagues had not been willing.  All the beloved\ndoctors and scientists, characterized as forthright, altruistic men and\nwomen, working for the good of humanity, if not actively involved, at\nleast turning the other way as innocent, uncomprehending creatures were\nsubjected to physical and psychological tortures that were the rival of\nthe Holocaust.  The Leeds Institute of Animal Research, called by its\ncritics, LIAR.\n\nShe kept thinking of Alaska.\n\nBut William felt no sympathy for her.  The fact that such men had\nmurdered themselves in the process, that humanity had been no kinder to\nits human victims, that it was \u0091over now', could not cover the\nbrutal shame of it.  All of it.  Could not bring back the dead.  The\ninnocent and the dead, who had been helpless before the grim\nmachinations of vicious human fear and ignorance.\n\nHe let her remain there, hobbled against a mound of slag.  Then he drew\nout his stiletto, and shot the blade into place.  And held it six inches\nfrom her face.  She had ceased weeping and sat helpless, sobbing, ready\nfor the fall.  As he said in a gentle, sing-song voice.\n\n'Time to wake u-up.'\n\nShe opened her hands and her eyes, as if seeing for the first time.\n\nShe opened her eyes.  The razor stood before her.  Not as some dark and\nfrightening intangible, but a stark physical reality, held in the iron\ngrip of her fellow man.  Because malicious evil is still only a weapon,\nand requires willing human hands to wield it.\n\nFor a single instant she sat there numb, neither believing nor\ncomprehending.  But then he seized her violently by the front of the\nblouse, lifting her to him.  And with a quick insertion of the blade and\na hard jerk backwards, he cut away her bra, ripping the garment wide\nopen as he threw her back onto the ground.\n\nA startled, 'William, don't do this,' tried to form in her\nthroat, but was drowned out as he screamed in a wrath no longer his own,\nbut that of all creatures brutalized and turned vicious by the bloody\nhells from which man has barely begun to raise himself.\n\n'And do you know who's going to PAY for it!  YOU ARE!'\n\nOne word alone would form from her terror, a last, instinctive cry\nagainst the Razor, and the trickle of blood at her breast. She screamed,\nlouder than he.\n\n'KALUS!'\n\n\n*\n\n\n>From a distance of three hundred yards he heard her.  Instantly his\n senses were trained upon the spot and he was running, leaving the\n startled cub far behind.  The broken, undulating ridges kept her from\n his sight, and tried to impede him.  But he did not need to hear the\n sound twice to locate it, or force his hammering body to respond.\n\nAnd by the time he reached the final crest, his anger had turned to a\nrage that bordered on madness that ANYONE, EVER, would DARE to attack\nhis woman.  All his pain and frustration now found release in thoughts,\nsoon to be acts, of violence.  The sight of them struggling, of William\nagain throwing her down and glowering over her, knife in hand, undid the\nlast thin strands of mercy and restraint.  He all but flew down the\nhill, and from atop the same mound of slag, leapt out like a panther\nwith a savage cry.\n\nAn instant later their bodies crashed together, as Sylviana crawled back\nagainst the shelter of broken stone, drawing her torn blouse shut\nagainst the maelstrom.\n\nWilliam was stunned, the knife sent flying from his hand.  For all the\nhardships of his life, he had never before faced the merciless onslaught\nof an animal defending its own.  Blows rained upon like a landslide, and\nhe knew that his death was at hand.  He backed away in desperation,\ncrawling on his elbows, pushing with his legs.\n\nBut Kalus was already on his feet, the sword seething from its scabbard.\nHe lofted it high above his head, both hands hard on the hilt, as his\neyes chose the place that he would strike, a thundering blow to cut his\nenemy in two.\n\nBut then time stood still.\n\n\n*\n\n\nTime stood still.\n\nKalus looked into the face of the man he was prepared to kill.  A\nhideous change had come over it.  His heart wrenched inside him, and the\nblow never fell.  Sylviana gasped as well, and struggled for the breath\nto plead mercy.  But there was no need, as both finally understood the\nwords of the Spirit.\n\nThere before him, where a human form had been, lay the contorted figure\nof a demon, a face twisted and insane.  A man possessed.  But not by\nsome Bible-black devil, or mythological spirit of Evil.  By the more\nreal, the more horrible.\n\nThe demon, the reality, of Fear.\n\nSlowly Kalus lowered his sword, sick with pity and remorse, as Sylviana\nhid her face against the stone.\n\nMore slowly still, some semblance of its original shape returned to the\nred terror of William's face.  And as terrible to him as his own\ncountenance had been to Kalus, were the words that his enemy now spoke,\nwho should have killed him.\n\n'Forgive me,' said the man-child sorrowfully.  'I didn't\nunderstand.'\n\nAs if struck by a hammer, William fell back.  Something inside him tried\nto laugh, but was drowned instead by anguished tears, and a groan of\npain that twisted his soul like a rag.  The terrible voice continued as\nthe cub, knowing nothing yet of hatred and violence, but only an\ninstinctive compassion, came closer and licked his face.\n\n'I knew only that you had lost your woman.  I did not know how deeply\nyou loved her, or what it had done to you.....  We will leave you now,\nbecause you need to be alone.'\n\nThen Kalus drew a breath, remembering hard reality.\n\n'It is only possible for a natural man to forgive, when his enemy can\nno longer hurt those entrusted to his care.  I cannot let you close to\nmy loved ones, and if you ever again try to hurt them, I will kill you\nwithout pity or remorse.  But I see now your pain and sickness, and I\nwill ask the others to help you if they can.'\n\nAnd the fallen man hid his face in shame.\n\nSylviana, who had risen, moved now toward her beloved mate.  She stood\nbeside him, looking down, silently begging forgiveness.  But his touch,\nthe way his arms enfolder her, told her there was no need, said\neverything that must be said.  Three words only remained, and she spoke\nthem with all her heart.\n\n'I love you.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 48\n\n\nTogether the weary lovers walked across the wounded landscape to the\nsea.  Reaching its margins, Kalus drew out the remaining peyote buttons.\nThe two exchanged glances, and both understood.\n\n'You have been both a teacher and a killer,' he said.  'But I\nhave no further need of you, nor would I ask another to follow down your\ndark and treacherous path.' And he threw them into the sea.  Then\ntogether they knelt in the cool and cleansing waters, and washed the\nsins from their hands.\n\nThen returning to the narrow stretch of sand, the woman-child lay back.\nShe lay very still, and listened to the stories told by the waves,\ntouching them all, and hiding from none.  Until all that remained was\nthe sun behind, the sea before, and the man she loved beside her.  She\nstood up and embraced him, and her soul was restored to her.\n\nAnd together they returned slowly to the colony, as Alaska strode beside\nthem, thinking of Akar, and of the wild woods of youth.  As Avatar ran\nfree, and the unborn life inside Kataya continued to grow.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAnd so one chapter ended, even as another began, as it always has been,\nand always will be.  The only question left before a man, as before Man\nhimself:\n\nWill he be a part of that tale?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.aragornbooks.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MANTOOTH***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 17394-8.txt or 17394-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/7/3/9/17394\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
